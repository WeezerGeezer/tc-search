00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, welcome to December."
00:04;00:09;"On today's Time Crisis, we're going to ask the hard questions."
00:09;00:11;"Like, what is a liberal?"
00:11;00:14;"We'll hear from a socialist and a conservative."
00:14;00:21;"We'll also pay tribute to a great man, Michael James Delegati, the creator of the Big Mac."
00:21;00:25;"This, plus the hits of 1967 and today."
00:25;00:27;"On today's..."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:33;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:33;00:35;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They pass me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"Do I, I felt, do I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I tell to the globe, one of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:18;"Leave her lonely babe."
01:18;01:23;"Sparing but concealing."
01:23;01:28;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:52;01:56;"I found a picture of you."
01:56;02:04;"Oh, what hijacked my world at night."
02:04;02:08;"To a place in the past we've been passed out of."
02:08;02:16;"Oh, now we're back in the fight."
02:16;02:22;"Back on the train again."
02:22;02:32;"Oh, back on the train again."
02:32;02:38;"Circumstance beyond our control."
02:38;02:45;"The phone, the TV and the news of the world."
02:45;02:49;"We've gotten the house like a pigeon from hell."
02:49;02:57;"Oh, through sand in our eyes and descended like flies."
02:57;03:00;"Put us back on the train."
03:00;03:09;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
03:09;03:12;"Back on the train again."
03:33;03:36;"The powers that be."
03:36;03:39;"The forces to live like we do."
03:39;03:42;"Bring me to my knees."
03:42;03:45;"When I see what they've done to you."
03:52;03:55;"I'll die as I stand here today."
03:55;03:58;"Knowing that deep in my heart."
03:58;04:12;"They'll fall to ruin one day for making us part."
04:12;04:15;"I found a picture of you."
04:15;04:24;"Oh, those were the happiest days of my life."
04:24;04:28;"Never breaking the battle was your part."
04:28;04:36;"Oh, in the wretched life of a lonely heart."
04:36;04:42;"Now we're back on the train again."
04:42;04:49;"Oh, back on the train again."
04:49;04:51;"That was the pretentious of back on the train again."
04:51;04:54;"And we're back on the chain gang, the time crisis chain gang."
04:54;04:55;"What's up, Jake?"
04:55;04:56;"Uh, not much."
04:56;04:57;"How are you?"
04:57;04:58;"Not bad."
04:58;04:59;"You like that song?"
04:59;05:01;"Yeah, wait, that was the pretenders?"
05:01;05:02;"Yeah."
05:02;05:03;"Back on the chain gang."
05:03;05:06;"Isn't there like an old chain gang song too?"
05:06;05:08;"Yeah, there's Sam Cooke."
05:08;05:10;"That's where they got the idea to do the chain gang noises."
05:10;05:11;"Huh."
05:11;05:16;"And like hitting the-- I was listening to this song recently, and I was like, Chrissy"
05:16;05:17;"Hynde is a great songwriter."
05:17;05:18;"Yeah."
05:18;05:19;"You know what's funny?"
05:19;05:23;"She's one of those people that I recognize that it's great, but I just don't connect."
05:23;05:27;"Well, you know, back on the chain gang, Brass in Pocket, you know."
05:27;05:28;"Yeah."
05:28;05:29;"I'm just talking about the hits, really."
05:29;05:30;"Great voice."
05:30;05:34;"But one thing that-- I never put this together, that-- so back on the chain gang is this pretenders"
05:34;05:36;"song from the early '80s."
05:36;05:43;"And then one of my other favorite artists, Selena, rest in peace, one of her big hits,"
05:43;05:47;"I think it was her brother, basically just took back on the chain gang and wrote like"
05:47;05:52;"a different lyrics in Spanish, like lightly inspired, like not quite a cover, more like"
05:52;05:56;"taking the music and then kind of like running with it."
05:56;05:58;"Like the Spanish lyrics, listen to this."
05:58;05:59;"I don't think I know it."
05:59;06:01;"Fotos y recuerdos."
06:01;06:02;"Did you study Spanish?"
06:02;06:03;"Yeah."
06:03;06:04;"So what does that mean?"
06:04;06:05;"Fotos?"
06:06;06:07;"Yeah."
06:07;06:09;"Y recuerdos."
06:09;06:10;"Oh, and memories?"
06:10;06:14;"Wait, and-- like, y being and, and then--"
06:14;06:16;"Yeah, it's like pictures and memories, photos and memories."
06:16;06:17;"I think."
06:17;06:20;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS]"
06:20;06:21;"Oh, yeah."
06:21;06:29;"From early '80s England to '90s Texas."
06:29;06:32;"Originating in Akron, Ohio, though."
06:32;06:35;"Christian-- right, true."
06:35;06:37;"Fully global."
06:37;06:38;"There's that riff."
06:38;06:41;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS]"
06:42;06:45;"[VOCALIZING]"
06:48;06:50;"[VOCALIZING]"
06:50;06:53;"[VOCALIZING]"
06:59;07:01;"[VOCALIZING]"
07:01;07:04;"[VOCALIZING]"
07:10;07:13;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS]"
07:13;07:14;"You get the idea."
07:14;07:15;"Yeah."
07:15;07:17;"But I love things like that."
07:17;07:21;"Two strong women connected across the decades"
07:21;07:23;"by the power of song."
07:23;07:26;"Also, back on the chain gang, it's definitely a classic,"
07:26;07:28;"but it's not like--"
07:28;07:30;"I wonder how many people, like Selena fans,"
07:30;07:33;"are also Pretenders fans."
07:33;07:35;"Well, that song is in the ether enough,"
07:35;07:39;"where I bet people who are hardcore Selena fans"
07:39;07:41;"might be like, this sounds familiar."
07:41;07:44;"I guess also when this came out, though, in the '90s,"
07:44;07:47;"you couldn't just go to the Wikipedia or the Genius page"
07:47;07:50;"for Fotos Y Recuerdos and be like, oh, you know,"
07:50;07:52;"this is kind of like an alternate version"
07:52;07:53;"of Back on the Chain Gang."
07:53;07:55;"You might find that out years later."
07:55;07:57;"If you're digging deep into the liner notes,"
07:57;08:00;"you're going to see a credit to the Pretenders for sure."
08:00;08:02;"Right, when you see that this song is credited"
08:02;08:04;"to Selena's brother and Chrissy Hind,"
08:04;08:07;"are the songwriters of Fotos Y Recuerdos."
08:07;08:08;"Yeah."
08:08;08:13;"R.I.P. Selena, time crisis favorite, always missing you."
08:13;08:15;"[MUSIC - FOTOS Y RECUERDOS, ""FOTOS Y RECUERDOS""]"
08:37;08:41;"Well, Jake, it was nice to just enjoy the power of music"
08:41;08:42;"as a connecting force--"
08:42;08:43;"Absolutely."
08:43;08:44;"--from the Pretenders to Selena."
08:44;08:49;"But unfortunately, these times are not all positive, are they?"
08:49;08:50;"No."
08:50;08:55;"And this is our second show back since Trump won the election."
08:55;08:56;"Yeah."
08:56;08:57;"How are you feeling?"
08:57;08:58;"Eh."
08:58;09:01;"I mean, in my life, you know, pretty good."
09:01;09:04;"But it does feel like a weird diagnosis or something."
09:04;09:06;"You know, you leave a movie or something,"
09:06;09:08;"and you're like, oh, Trump won."
09:08;09:09;"Right."
09:09;09:12;"I'll think about the fact that Trump won maybe like three times"
09:12;09:14;"during the course of a movie."
09:14;09:15;"I'll be basically immersed--"
09:15;09:16;"Like in the theater?"
09:16;09:18;"--or at home, whatever, just like immersed in whatever"
09:18;09:21;"I'm sort of like absorbing."
09:21;09:22;"Right."
09:22;09:24;"But then it'll be kind of creeping along the edges"
09:24;09:25;"of my consciousness."
09:25;09:28;"And then when I leave the theater--"
09:28;09:29;"Yeah."
09:29;09:31;"--it'll be fully like, oh."
09:31;09:33;"You step back into the daylight."
09:33;09:34;"Yep."
09:34;09:35;"That Trump daylight."
09:35;09:37;"I saw Arrival."
09:37;09:39;"I didn't think about Trump once."
09:39;09:44;"I think it's because of Denis Villeneuve's tight storytelling,"
09:44;09:49;"the compelling narrative, as well as groundbreaking performances"
09:49;09:51;"by Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner."
09:51;09:54;"All those things helped keep me in the moment,"
09:54;09:57;"keep my mind off of President Trump."
09:57;09:58;"You didn't see it yet?"
09:58;09:59;"I want to see it."
09:59;10:00;"It looks great."
10:00;10:02;"And I loved his last film, Sicario."
10:02;10:03;"He's an interesting guy."
10:03;10:07;"He's making movies about the drug war, aliens."
10:07;10:08;"Yeah."
10:08;10:10;"It's kind of a linguistics aliens movie."
10:10;10:11;"Yeah."
10:11;10:14;"You know, Jake, one thing I thought we'd talk about today"
10:14;10:18;"is what it means to be a liberal because it's a word that's"
10:18;10:21;"been flying around a lot, I mean, always,"
10:21;10:23;"but especially post-election."
10:23;10:25;"Tensions have been running high."
10:25;10:27;"And you know, I realized something."
10:27;10:30;"For most of my life, I didn't even know if I was a liberal."
10:30;10:32;"I mean, I kind of thought I was."
10:32;10:35;"We both would probably describe ourselves as people who are raised"
10:35;10:36;"in liberal households."
10:36;10:38;"Moderately liberal."
10:38;10:40;"Moderate liberal households."
10:40;10:44;"But it's been interesting that after you see a lot of infighting"
10:44;10:48;"on what people call the left, you see a lot of people saying,"
10:48;10:50;"like, Hillary was a liberal."
10:50;10:53;"She was a moderate liberal, but that's not what we needed."
10:53;10:57;"And increasingly, you see people making fun of liberals."
10:57;10:59;"And I realized something, like, you know,"
10:59;11:03;"a lot of people think liberal just means that you're not a conservative."
11:03;11:04;"Right."
11:04;11:07;"So you see a lot of people being like, hey, come on, we're all liberals here."
11:07;11:08;"Let's agree."
11:08;11:11;"But some people on the left don't identify as liberals."
11:11;11:14;"So we're going to talk to some people."
11:14;11:17;"We got Rehan Salam, who's a conservative."
11:17;11:20;"He's going to tell us what liberal means to him because you can't ask a liberal"
11:20;11:22;"what it means to be a liberal, you know?"
11:22;11:23;"They don't know."
11:23;11:24;"That's just what they are."
11:24;11:27;"And we're also going to talk to Connor Kilpatrick,"
11:27;11:30;"who is a socialist or perhaps a Marxist."
11:30;11:33;"Works at a socialist magazine called Jacobin."
11:33;11:35;"So we're going to get some different perspectives."
11:35;11:37;"But first of all, do you know this song from the '60s,"
11:37;11:39;"""Phil Oaks, Love Me, I'm a Liberal""?"
11:39;11:41;"I don't know if I do."
11:41;11:45;"So this whole, like, liberal radical divide or liberal socialist divide,"
11:45;11:47;"it goes back all the way to the '60s."
11:47;11:50;"So Phil Oaks was, like, a folk singer."
11:50;11:51;"Sure."
11:51;11:53;"You know, he was on the right side of history, right?"
11:53;11:54;"Yeah."
11:54;11:56;"He was like a fight the power type guy."
11:56;11:57;"But so he had this song."
11:57;11:58;"This is from the '60s."
11:58;12:00;"Let's listen to it, and let's go, you know,"
12:00;12:03;"go back to the '60s and see what people were talking about back then."
12:03;12:07;"In every American community, you have varying shades of political opinion."
12:07;12:09;"One of the shadiest of these is the liberals."
12:09;12:17;"[applause]"
12:17;12:21;"An outspoken group on many subjects."
12:21;12:24;"Ten degrees to the left of center in good times."
12:24;12:27;"Ten degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally."
12:27;12:33;"[applause]"
12:33;12:35;"So here, then, is a lesson in safe logic."
12:39;12:43;"I cried when they shot Medgar Evers."
12:43;12:47;"Tears ran down my spine."
12:47;12:51;"And I cried when they shot Mr. Kennedy."
12:51;12:55;"As though I'd lost a father of mine."
12:55;12:59;"But Malcolm X got what was coming."
12:59;13:03;"He got what he asked for this time."
13:03;13:07;"So love me, love me, love me."
13:07;13:10;"I'm a liberal."
13:10;13:13;"Get it?"
13:13;13:15;"Sort of."
13:15;13:16;"Let's stick with him."
13:16;13:18;"Okay, yeah, I'm in."
13:18;13:22;"I go to civil rights rallies."
13:22;13:25;"And I put down the old DAR."
13:25;13:28;"DAR, that's the dykes of the American Revolution."
13:28;13:30;"[laughter]"
13:30;13:33;"I love Harry and Sidney and Sammy."
13:33;13:37;"I hope every colored boy becomes a star."
13:37;13:41;"But don't talk about revolution."
13:41;13:45;"That's going a little bit too far."
13:45;13:48;"So love me, love me, love me."
13:48;13:52;"I'm a liberal."
13:52;13:56;"I cheered when Humphrey was chosen."
13:56;14:00;"My faith in the system restored."
14:00;14:03;"And I'm glad that the commies were thrown out"
14:03;14:07;"From the AFL-CIO bar."
14:07;14:11;"And I love Puerto Ricans and Negroes"
14:11;14:15;"As long as they don't move next door."
14:15;14:18;"So love me, love me, love me."
14:18;14:22;"I'm a liberal."
14:22;14:26;"Ah, the people of old Mississippi"
14:26;14:30;"Should all hang their heads in shame."
14:30;14:33;"Now I can't understand how their minds work."
14:33;14:35;"What's the matter?"
14:35;14:38;"Don't they watch Last Crane?"
14:38;14:42;"But if you ask me to bust my children"
14:42;14:46;"I hope the cops take down your name."
14:46;14:49;"So love me, love me, love me."
14:49;14:53;"I'm a liberal."
14:53;14:57;"Yes, I read New Republic and Nation."
14:57;15:00;"I've learned to take every view."
15:00;15:04;"You know, I've memorized Lerner and Golden."
15:04;15:08;"I feel like I'm almost a Jew."
15:08;15:12;"But when it comes to times like Korea"
15:12;15:16;"There's no one more red, white, and blue."
15:16;15:19;"So love me, love me, love me."
15:19;15:23;"I'm a liberal."
15:23;15:27;"I vote for the Democratic Party."
15:27;15:30;"They want the U.N. to be strong."
15:30;15:34;"I attend all the Pete Seeger concerts."
15:34;15:37;"He sure gets me singing those songs."
15:37;15:41;"And I'll send all the money you ask for."
15:41;15:45;"But don't ask me to come on along."
15:45;15:48;"So love me, love me, love me."
15:48;15:53;"I'm a liberal."
15:53;15:57;"Sure, once I was young and impulsive."
15:57;16:01;"I wore every conceivable pin."
16:01;16:04;"Even went to socialist meetings."
16:04;16:08;"Learned all the old Union hymns."
16:08;16:12;"Ah, but I've grown older and wiser."
16:12;16:16;"And that's why I'm turning you in."
16:16;16:20;"So love me, love me, love me."
16:20;16:26;"I'm a liberal."
16:26;16:30;"I'm a liberal."
16:31;16:37;"I'm a liberal."
16:37;16:42;"Reference to MLK or RFK no no he said well being dead yeah being killed, but then he references Humphrey no"
16:42;16:46;"No, you reference him he referenced them okay being killed he did yeah"
16:46;16:52;"He said he was like sad that he died and he said that Kennedy died, but Malcolm X he got what he got was coming"
16:52;16:54;"So let's break that down cuz yeah"
16:54;16:56;"first of all a shocking line"
16:56;17:03;"Change like a bunch of references and lyrics it definitely speaks to a divide that exists today sure so for him"
17:03;17:06;"He's talking this perspective that I think being a liberal"
17:06;17:09;"means that you're"
17:09;17:11;"Veering in the right direction you pay lip service"
17:11;17:17;"In Phil Oaks view you pay lip service to the idea of racial equality"
17:17;17:22;"You listen to the right things and his day. It was Pete Seeger. I don't know what the Pete Seeger of our day is"
17:22;17:29;"The right thing that you listen to to kind of show that you care about what's happening. No definitely not John Mayer"
17:29;17:35;"There'd be like the equivalent of waiting on the world to change maybe or like the rich white guy today"
17:35;17:38;"He'd be like you're the new Kendrick now. That's that's something"
17:38;17:43;"I wish I wish some of those black lives matter protesters would would maybe spend more time in the studio"
17:43;17:47;"You know so whatever he's saying a liberal is somebody who?"
17:47;17:50;"pays lip service to racial equality"
17:50;17:53;"Says and likes the right things"
17:53;17:58;"Talks the talk talks the talk is hawkish. Maybe doesn't walk the walk. He said something about remember"
17:59;18:04;"But when it comes to something like Korea, there's nobody more red white and blue so he's saying like yeah"
18:04;18:09;"You know I'll poke at the system here and there, but if it's time to go to war. I'm a patriot"
18:09;18:14;"Well, so one thing that's interesting because this isn't hasn't gone away. He talks about I can't believe"
18:14;18:18;"Basically those hicks down in Mississippi those racist"
18:18;18:23;"Idiots, but how dare you tell me that my kids have to go to school with poor black children"
18:23;18:27;"Which still is something that that is this kind of weird liberal divide?"
18:28;18:36;"Limousine liberal that's the right like the classic catchphrase you're angry at all those racists who are not you elsewhere"
18:36;18:42;"But your kids go to an elite private school, so it's kind of interesting like that song"
18:42;18:48;"I'm not gonna say it feels fresh. He's still using the word Negro, but it doesn't feel too dated"
18:48;18:53;"No, I mean yeah, I think the election opened up some wounds that are deeply"
18:53;18:56;"ancient to our species"
18:56;19:00;"Yeah, I mean you know they're gonna ebb and flow"
19:00;19:06;"And I mean and I feel like we were raised a little bit to think of that the ancient wounds"
19:06;19:13;"It's a binary. It's the liberals and the conservatives like I think there's a lot of talk with Obama remember when they were like you know"
19:13;19:14;"Obama"
19:14;19:20;"He was barely alive in the Vietnam era so he's the first politician who kind of can be a unifier"
19:20;19:25;"You know because that was this really tough time in American history where liberals and conservatives hated each other"
19:25;19:31;"But this song makes you realize it's not just a two-way battle. It's been a three-way battle minimum"
19:31;19:36;"For the soul of America you got your liberals your conservatives, and I guess your radicals"
19:36;19:43;"Yeah, and obviously the conservative wing would splinter off - I mean you write your guy your Nazis"
19:43;19:46;"Well, yeah, yeah, or you have your like your Christian, right, and then you have your like"
19:46;19:51;"Urban fiscal conservatives who don't care about social issues"
19:51;19:56;"I mean everything can splinter off into like a million part. You know you don't always feel it during an election"
19:56;19:58;"And I think in this election especially in the primary a"
19:58;20:05;"Lot of people started talking about well Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist and Hillary is a hawkish liberal"
20:05;20:07;"that's at least what people said and"
20:07;20:10;"There hadn't really been a primary at least that I remember where we had to even think about"
20:10;20:16;"What do those things mean Bernie and Hillary agree on most things, but on some fundamental things they disagree?"
20:16;20:18;"I imagine if Phil Oaks was alive"
20:18;20:20;"he would apply some of these things to"
20:21;20:24;"The Hillary's the Chuck Schumer's the Harry Reid's the"
20:24;20:27;"people who lean"
20:27;20:29;"left at certain times, but"
20:29;20:32;"Not across the board"
20:32;20:45;"Raised from the dust of all days"
20:49;20:51;"Learn from the air"
20:51;20:56;"Oh is this"
20:56;21:03;"Light in the dark"
21:03;21:09;"Well, I know"
21:09;21:13;"Take hold of my hand"
21:13;21:15;"Words"
21:15;21:17;"Smile and ask"
21:17;21:21;"Where is this love"
21:21;21:27;"Are we just having fun"
21:27;21:33;"Are you waiting just for me"
21:33;21:39;"Out where the heavens meet the sea"
21:40;21:42;"Oh"
21:42;21:44;"I knew it when we met"
21:44;21:46;"And time stood still"
21:46;21:48;"A light in the dark of the world"
21:48;21:50;"Well I know"
21:50;21:52;"What that suggests"
21:52;21:54;"Take hold of my hand"
21:54;21:56;"The words"
21:56;21:58;"Smile and ask"
21:58;22:00;"What a gift for today"
22:00;22:02;"I know"
22:08;22:10;"What a gift for today"
22:10;22:16;"Well it always remains"
22:16;22:20;"How long does a good thing last"
22:20;22:26;"Can we avoid mistakes from the past"
22:26;22:32;"Oh and what if it dies"
22:36;22:38;"Just disappears from your eyes"
22:38;22:44;"Well you don't have to dance"
22:44;22:48;"Just take hold of my hand"
22:48;22:50;"The words"
22:50;22:52;"Smile and ask"
22:52;22:56;"Well I know"
22:56;22:58;"What that suggests"
22:58;23:00;"Take hold of my hand"
23:00;23:02;"The words"
23:02;23:04;"Smile and ask"
23:04;23:06;"What a gift for today"
23:06;23:08;"I know"
23:08;23:10;"What a gift for today"
23:10;23:16;"Oh is this love"
23:16;23:18;"A light in the dark of the world"
23:18;23:22;"Oh is this love"
23:22;23:24;"A light in the dark of the world"
23:24;23:28;"Oh is this love"
23:28;23:30;"A light in the dark of the world"
23:32;23:34;"Oh is this love"
23:34;23:36;"Is this love"
23:36;23:40;"Oh is this love"
23:40;23:42;"Is this love"
24:06;24:08;"So I'm interested to find out"
24:08;24:10;"from a socialist"
24:10;24:12;"and a conservative what liberalism"
24:12;24:14;"means to them because so often"
24:14;24:16;"you know like we grew up in our moderate liberal households"
24:16;24:18;"we just accept that we're liberals"
24:18;24:20;"we're daily show liberals"
24:20;24:24;"It's definitely a type"
24:24;24:26;"Well so the first person I'm going to talk to"
24:26;24:28;"his name is Connor Kilpatrick"
24:28;24:30;"I met him for the first time when I was home"
24:30;24:32;"in New York last week"
24:32;24:34;"and he's on the editorial"
24:34;24:36;"board of a socialist magazine"
24:36;24:38;"called Jockman"
24:38;24:40;"You know that? Jockaman? What's that?"
24:40;24:42;"J-A-C-O-B-I-N"
24:42;24:44;"What does that mean? I think it's related to the"
24:44;24:46;"French Revolution"
24:46;24:48;"But as a liberal I'm not going to go any further"
24:48;24:50;"than that"
24:50;24:52;"I talk the talk, I don't do facts"
24:52;24:54;"But Jockaman is a"
24:54;24:56;"leading voice of the American left offering socialist"
24:56;24:58;"perspectives on politics, economics"
24:58;25:00;"and culture. The print magazine is released"
25:00;25:02;"quarterly and reaches over 20,000"
25:02;25:04;"subscribers"
25:04;25:06;"Decent. Cool"
25:06;25:08;"In addition to a web audience of over a million"
25:08;25:10;"a month. So these guys are socialists"
25:10;25:12;"not liberals"
25:12;25:14;"Yeah. So we got to talk"
25:14;25:16;"to him and find out what"
25:16;25:18;"liberalism means to him"
25:18;25:20;"Now let's go to the time crisis"
25:20;25:22;"hotline"
25:22;25:26;"Hey what's up Connor? Welcome to time crisis"
25:26;25:28;"Yeah hey what's up? First time on the show"
25:28;25:30;"you're on with me and Jake. Hi Jake"
25:30;25:32;"What's up? So Connor"
25:32;25:34;"you know Jake and I we're both sensitive"
25:34;25:36;"artistic souls. We like music"
25:36;25:38;"poetry, painting"
25:38;25:40;"so we don't know a lot about"
25:40;25:42;"politics but we're just trying to educate ourselves"
25:42;25:44;"and our listeners. So"
25:44;25:46;"you are on the editorial board"
25:46;25:48;"of a socialist magazine"
25:48;25:50;"Ok so explain it to us"
25:50;25:52;"like we don't know nothing"
25:52;25:54;"from where you sit"
25:54;25:56;"on the editorial board of a socialist"
25:56;25:58;"magazine. What is the"
25:58;26:00;"difference between a socialist and a liberal"
26:00;26:02;"and why are you a socialist and not a liberal?"
26:02;26:04;"Alright so"
26:04;26:06;"I guess first you have to like"
26:06;26:08;"realize that America is a special case"
26:08;26:10;"in that other western"
26:10;26:12;"countries they have three major"
26:12;26:14;"political parties. A conservative"
26:14;26:16;"party, a liberal party"
26:16;26:18;"and then a social democratic, socialist"
26:18;26:20;"or labor party. So that"
26:20;26:22;"basically means that there's"
26:22;26:24;"the center right party"
26:24;26:26;"the conservative party and then the"
26:26;26:28;"center left party which is the social"
26:28;26:30;"democratic, labor or socialist"
26:30;26:32;"parties and then there's"
26:32;26:34;"the liberal party which is actually a"
26:34;26:36;"centrist party. Well hold on a second"
26:36;26:38;"so you're telling me that most"
26:38;26:40;"other western countries"
26:40;26:42;"have three parties and America only has"
26:42;26:44;"two? I thought we normally had more of everything"
26:44;26:46;"in America. More choices"
26:46;26:48;"For a lot of different reasons"
26:48;26:50;"America, even though we had the"
26:50;26:52;"most violent labor"
26:52;26:54;"in western history we did not"
26:54;26:56;"get a labor party unlike"
26:56;26:58;"every other western country for a variety"
26:58;27:00;"of reasons so that movement"
27:00;27:02;"of working class, socialists"
27:02;27:04;"and radicals they basically"
27:04;27:06;"got folded into our liberal"
27:06;27:08;"party, the democratic party. So"
27:08;27:10;"our liberal party has been"
27:10;27:12;"this weird thing"
27:12;27:14;"where it's a liberal party"
27:14;27:16;"with this labor union"
27:16;27:18;"and socialist"
27:18;27:20;"constituency in it that has been"
27:20;27:22;"decreasing in its"
27:22;27:24;"power and influence in the party to the"
27:24;27:26;"point of which now it's like less than"
27:26;27:28;"a sidekick. Yeah because I thought that"
27:28;27:30;"the democrats were the ones who really"
27:30;27:32;"cared about working class people"
27:32;27:34;"so why would a socialist not"
27:34;27:36;"like the democrats? What's wrong with"
27:36;27:38;"them in your opinion? There's a"
27:38;27:40;"great quote from Kevin Phillips who"
27:40;27:42;"helped launch Nixon's"
27:42;27:44;"southern strategy and he called the democrats"
27:44;27:46;"history's second most"
27:46;27:48;"enthusiastic party of capital"
27:48;27:50;"and so I think that"
27:50;27:52;"that's my issue with the democrats is that"
27:52;27:54;"basically the democratic"
27:54;27:56;"party has only really been"
27:56;27:58;"worth a damn and thus"
27:58;28:00;"American liberalism has only really been worth a damn"
28:00;28:02;"when it had this really"
28:02;28:04;"strong, vibrant labor"
28:04;28:06;"movement part in it"
28:06;28:08;"and that's the 1930s and that was"
28:08;28:10;"actually only made possible because a lot"
28:10;28:12;"of those crazy labor radicals"
28:12;28:14;"running around in the 30s were literal communist"
28:14;28:16;"socialists but"
28:16;28:18;"the labor movement first purged"
28:18;28:20;"all the radicals in the 40s"
28:20;28:22;"and before"
28:22;28:24;"Joe McCarthy"
28:24;28:26;"basically that labor movement just got"
28:26;28:28;"smaller and smaller and"
28:28;28:30;"a smaller part of the democratic"
28:30;28:32;"party's coalition and as"
28:32;28:34;"that happened people like"
28:34;28:36;"Silicon Valley and"
28:36;28:38;"they were called the Atari democrats in the"
28:38;28:40;"70s like these affluent"
28:40;28:42;"white collar professionals kind of filled"
28:42;28:44;"in the gap in the democratic party"
28:44;28:46;"and they kind of took over the party to the point in which"
28:46;28:48;"now it doesn't seem that"
28:48;28:50;"crazy that there was"
28:50;28:52;"a couple of tech billionaires who Hillary"
28:52;28:54;"Clinton was considering making her vice president"
28:54;28:56;"that would have been unthinkable"
28:56;28:58;"in the 30s, 40s"
28:58;29:00;"50s, 60s. Yeah it seems like"
29:00;29:02;"the party is both Occupy"
29:02;29:04;"Wall Street and Wall Street"
29:04;29:06;"which seems like irreconcilable"
29:06;29:08;"That's a party that"
29:08;29:10;"eventually there's going to be a reckoning"
29:10;29:12;"You know when I try to think about what I believe in"
29:12;29:14;"definitely one important thing"
29:14;29:16;"I believe that we live in a very"
29:16;29:18;"unequal society and that people should be"
29:18;29:20;"equal regardless of"
29:20;29:22;"race, gender, sexual"
29:22;29:24;"orientation or"
29:24;29:26;"the class they were born into"
29:26;29:28;"and I hear a lot of people yelling in my ear both"
29:28;29:30;"ways that actually the liberal path"
29:30;29:32;"is going to bring more equality and then the socialists"
29:32;29:34;"are always talking about class and labor unions"
29:34;29:36;"it's confusing. So if I'm"
29:36;29:38;"somebody who truly thinks that"
29:38;29:40;"the republicans are nuts"
29:40;29:42;"the way the people of color are treated"
29:42;29:44;"is disgusting, the way that"
29:44;29:46;"trans and gay people are"
29:46;29:48;"treated is disgusting and the growing"
29:48;29:50;"wealth inequality is disgusting"
29:50;29:52;"where do I go? Make a case for me."
29:52;29:54;"I would make the case that you should become a socialist"
29:54;29:56;"and here is why"
29:56;29:58;"because it sounds like the problem you're describing"
29:58;30:00;"is that you believe in equality"
30:00;30:02;"and you believe in democracy"
30:02;30:04;"my issue with liberalism"
30:04;30:06;"is that it only wants to extend these"
30:06;30:08;"things to the political"
30:08;30:10;"sphere. Socialists are"
30:10;30:12;"basically radical democrats"
30:12;30:14;"we want to make"
30:14;30:16;"all parts of life more"
30:16;30:18;"egalitarian and you obviously"
30:18;30:20;"you can't have"
30:20;30:22;"billionaires and people who make"
30:22;30:24;"25 grand a year and have"
30:24;30:26;"a truly equal society. So"
30:26;30:28;"no socialist wants to make"
30:28;30:30;"everybody have the same"
30:30;30:32;"amount of money. I mean even Karl Marx didn't"
30:32;30:34;"believe in that. He thought that was a quote"
30:34;30:36;"bourgeois value. A socialist"
30:36;30:38;"finds the extreme"
30:38;30:40;"extent of the material"
30:40;30:42;"inequality, the amount"
30:42;30:44;"between the poor and the rich"
30:44;30:46;"so gross that we want"
30:46;30:48;"a radical compression. What would things look like"
30:48;30:50;"under socialism? Because I think probably a lot of"
30:50;30:52;"listeners are wondering that. Because there's a"
30:52;30:54;"lot of things that we love. We love"
30:54;30:56;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos. They're made by a big"
30:56;30:58;"corporation, the Frito-Lay Corporation."
30:58;31:00;"Under socialism, are there"
31:00;31:02;"going to be Flamin' Hot Cheetos? And I want a straight answer"
31:02;31:04;"from you. I'm going to say there are definitely going to be"
31:04;31:06;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos. It's not that"
31:06;31:08;"socialists think there should be"
31:08;31:10;"nothing like a corporation"
31:10;31:12;"it's that they think that instead of having a"
31:12;31:14;"corporate board of shareholders who don't do"
31:14;31:16;"anything, well why shouldn't it be"
31:16;31:18;"the people who work for"
31:18;31:20;"Cheetos or whoever the fine"
31:20;31:22;"makers of that product are, why shouldn't it be"
31:22;31:24;"them who's kind of making the"
31:24;31:26;"decisions of the company. There's a"
31:26;31:28;"one of the largest corporations in"
31:28;31:30;"Spain is the Mondragon Corporation."
31:30;31:32;"It's in the wealthiest region"
31:32;31:34;"of Spain. It's what I just described."
31:34;31:36;"It's a kind of economic democracy"
31:36;31:38;"which is a corporation which all the shareholders"
31:38;31:40;"are workers there. Okay, so there"
31:40;31:42;"still would be corporations, there still would be Flamin'"
31:42;31:44;"Hot Cheetos. Would there still be"
31:44;31:46;"elegant luxury products?"
31:46;31:48;"Would there still be like Rolexes,"
31:48;31:50;"Ralph Lauren, cashmere"
31:50;31:52;"sweaters, things like that? Or would everybody"
31:52;31:54;"have to kind of wear kind of like cheap"
31:54;31:56;"50/50 cotton poly blends"
31:56;31:58;"we'd all have to wear the same thing? Will there still"
31:58;32:00;"be like fancy stuff? I think there's a middle"
32:00;32:02;"ground there that's possible. I think"
32:02;32:04;"the point that I should make is that"
32:04;32:06;"it's not really even markets that are"
32:06;32:08;"the problem. Markets and consumer goods"
32:08;32:10;"existed before capitalism."
32:10;32:12;"It's the fact that there's markets,"
32:12;32:14;"there's labor markets and financial"
32:14;32:16;"markets. That's the problem"
32:16;32:18;"as I see it. And as a"
32:18;32:20;"socialist, that's my piece"
32:20;32:22;"of capitalism. Okay, one last question for you"
32:22;32:24;"Conor, we appreciate you taking the time to"
32:24;32:26;"educate us about liberalism"
32:26;32:28;"versus socialism."
32:28;32:30;"Now, as a socialist,"
32:30;32:32;"are there people within the Democratic"
32:32;32:34;"Party that you"
32:34;32:36;"are excited about? That you think"
32:36;32:38;"a person with socialist values could"
32:38;32:40;"get behind as we look to the future?"
32:40;32:42;"Oh hell yeah! I mean, just as the Democratic"
32:42;32:44;"Party is this weird"
32:44;32:46;"conglomeration"
32:46;32:48;"of billionaires"
32:48;32:50;"and working class people,"
32:50;32:52;"there are politicians in the Democratic Party,"
32:52;32:54;"there's truly awful"
32:54;32:56;"servants of"
32:56;32:58;"the billionaire class, someone like Chuck"
32:58;33:00;"Schumer who is protecting the hedge fund"
33:00;33:02;"manager tax loophole,"
33:02;33:04;"which allows hedge fund managers to pay a tiny percentage"
33:04;33:06;"of tax. There's also"
33:06;33:08;"great people like Bernie Sanders"
33:08;33:10;"and Keith Ellison"
33:10;33:12;"and Barbara Lee"
33:12;33:14;"and even though he endorsed Hillary Clinton,"
33:14;33:16;"I really like Sherrod Brown. Who's Sherrod Brown?"
33:16;33:18;"Where is he from? Ohio? Yeah, he's"
33:18;33:20;"an Ohio senator. These are all"
33:20;33:22;"like the old, they're more old school"
33:22;33:24;"Democrats. They're the old labor"
33:24;33:26;"Democrats, labor liberals. That's the kind of"
33:26;33:28;"liberalism that I totally"
33:28;33:30;"want to work with. That's the thing, it's not"
33:30;33:32;"that all liberals are bad. It's like, what kind of"
33:32;33:34;"liberal are you? Are you a liberal who's like"
33:34;33:36;"I think a society in which"
33:36;33:38;"we have billionaires"
33:38;33:40;"and yeah, there's a lot of poor"
33:40;33:42;"people but it's worth it for"
33:42;33:44;"progress or are you"
33:44;33:46;"a liberal who believes in"
33:46;33:48;"using the power of the states"
33:48;33:50;"to make things materially more"
33:50;33:52;"equal? Hmm, what kind of liberal"
33:52;33:54;"do you want to be? I think that's a good place to end things"
33:54;33:56;"Connor. Jake and I are going to discuss that a little bit."
33:56;33:58;"Thanks so much for calling in."
33:58;34:00;"The magazine is called Jocobin."
34:00;34:02;"Is that how you guys pronounce it? Jocobin?"
34:02;34:04;"Yeah, if you want to sound fancy you can say Jocobin"
34:04;34:06;"but I say Jacobin. Jacobin."
34:06;34:08;"Alright, thanks Connor. We'll talk to you soon."
34:08;34:10;"Okay. Well Jake, what do you think man?"
34:10;34:12;"Should we be liberals or socialists?"
34:12;34:14;"Or what type of liberal should we be?"
34:14;34:16;"I don't know."
34:16;34:18;"I don't have a bone to pick with anything he was saying."
34:18;34:20;"In terms of working towards"
34:20;34:22;"a more egalitarian society."
34:22;34:24;"You know me and the third parties, I mean"
34:24;34:26;"Can't stand them. Yeah, I mean we'll look at that"
34:26;34:28;"news that just came out the other day where"
34:28;34:30;"the Stein margins"
34:30;34:32;"50,000 people voted for Stein in Michigan"
34:32;34:34;"and Trump won it by 10,000."
34:34;34:36;"That drives me crazy."
34:36;34:38;"That's sort of getting off the topic of what we're talking about. I understand that."
34:38;34:40;"I'm just saying in terms of"
34:40;34:42;"an idea, like why don't we start with our ideology"
34:42;34:44;"and then decide, you know, how to"
34:44;34:46;"go about implementing it. Whether it's within"
34:46;34:48;"or without the Democratic Party."
34:48;34:50;"Would you ever define yourself as a socialist?"
34:50;34:52;"I don't think I would."
34:52;34:54;"But I'm trying to examine why I wouldn't."
34:54;34:56;"Is it because in our kind of like"
34:56;34:58;"milieu, our LA New York scene"
34:58;35:00;"if you started saying that you were a socialist"
35:00;35:02;"people at parties would"
35:02;35:04;"roll their eyes and just be like, ""Oh, you're trying"
35:04;35:06;"so hard, man. Like, give it up."""
35:06;35:08;"Yeah,"
35:08;35:10;"maybe because I would feel like I was"
35:10;35:12;"just being a poser."
35:12;35:14;"Like that guy that we just talked to, Connor, runs"
35:14;35:16;"a magazine. He seems very knowledgeable."
35:16;35:18;"He seems like he's devoting a lot of his life and energy"
35:18;35:20;"into thinking and writing about these things."
35:20;35:22;"And I'm not."
35:22;35:24;"So it would feel weird to all of a sudden"
35:24;35:26;"come out with a new haircut and be like,"
35:26;35:28;"""Oh, I'm a socialist."""
35:28;35:30;"It would just feel like slightly disingenuous."
35:30;35:32;"I loved Bernie Sanders as a candidate."
35:32;35:34;"I liked a lot of what"
35:34;35:36;"Connor was saying, so, you know."
35:36;35:38;"That was interesting what he said,"
35:38;35:40;"that other countries have three parties"
35:40;35:42;"generally. Probably more, but three"
35:42;35:44;"main parties. And we have"
35:44;35:46;"kind of two crammed into one over here."
35:46;35:48;"We really do. So I think it is important"
35:48;35:50;"for especially young people,"
35:50;35:52;"people younger than us,"
35:52;35:54;"to start to look at the Democratic Party"
35:54;35:56;"as being a hybrid party and identify"
35:56;35:58;"what those two parts are. Because it's really annoying"
35:58;36:00;"when you try to have a conversation, people are like, ""Well, you're"
36:00;36:02;"Democrat or not? Do you support"
36:02;36:04;"the party or not?"" And it's like, I don't know."
36:04;36:06;"There's a lot of different people in the party."
36:06;36:08;"There's a lot of politic and"
36:08;36:10;"disagreement on every side of the"
36:10;36:12;"political spectrum. So I do think"
36:12;36:14;"now is the time to not just"
36:14;36:16;"be like, ""Alright, come on. Democrats"
36:16;36:18;"just shut up. Get in line."""
36:18;36:20;"Now is the time to really talk about"
36:20;36:22;"which wing of the party"
36:22;36:24;"do we want to support. So that's"
36:24;36:26;"coming from the socialist point of view. That's"
36:26;36:28;"to the left of the liberals."
36:28;36:30;"I think now we've got to hear from the right"
36:30;36:32;"of the liberals. We're going to talk to a conservative."
36:32;36:34;"A buddy of yours named"
36:34;36:36;"Raihan Salam."
36:36;36:38;"So Raihan"
36:38;36:40;"is a conservative American political commentator,"
36:40;36:42;"columnist, and author. He is"
36:42;36:44;"the executive editor of National Review"
36:44;36:46;"and a columnist for Slate."
36:46;36:48;"So he'll be coming at it from a"
36:48;36:50;"different angle. So let's find out how he"
36:50;36:52;"defines himself and what liberalism"
36:52;36:54;"means to him."
36:54;36:56;"""Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."""
36:56;36:58;"[phone ringing]"
36:58;37:00;"Hello, Raihan."
37:00;37:02;"""Hello!"" Hey, what's up, man?"
37:02;37:04;"Welcome to Time Crisis. ""Thanks for having me."""
37:04;37:06;"You're on with me and Jake. So the theme of the"
37:06;37:08;"first part of today's show on Time Crisis,"
37:08;37:10;"it's not a political show. It's a show"
37:10;37:12;"that's really about classic rock"
37:12;37:14;"and Frito-Lay's products."
37:14;37:16;"But, you know, given that we just had an election,"
37:16;37:18;"Jake and I are trying to educate"
37:18;37:20;"ourselves and talk about"
37:20;37:22;"stuff outside of our wheelhouse,"
37:22;37:24;"snack foods, and classic rock."
37:24;37:26;"The big question for us that we've been talking about is"
37:26;37:28;"what is a liberal? Because we both"
37:28;37:30;"kind of were raised in what we thought were"
37:30;37:32;"liberal households, but we're realizing that"
37:32;37:34;"we're barely even sure what a liberal is."
37:34;37:36;"And we just talked to Connor Kilpatrick, who's a"
37:36;37:38;"socialist, and he"
37:38;37:40;"explained to us why he's not a liberal."
37:40;37:42;"So for our listeners at home, people are trying to figure"
37:42;37:44;"out what they are"
37:44;37:46;"in this big, crazy world."
37:46;37:48;"What is a conservative and why are you a conservative?"
37:48;37:50;"It means a lot of different things to"
37:50;37:52;"different people, and I would"
37:52;37:54;"stress that my answer is very"
37:54;37:56;"idiosyncratic to me."
37:56;37:58;"But I'd broadly say that"
37:58;38:00;"being a conservative"
38:00;38:02;"is all about"
38:02;38:04;"not wanting to crash the car."
38:04;38:06;"The idea is that"
38:06;38:08;"we're all in society,"
38:08;38:10;"we're all in this car together,"
38:10;38:12;"and we are, you know,"
38:12;38:14;"maybe we're careening at really high"
38:14;38:16;"speed towards a brick wall, maybe we're"
38:16;38:18;"just driving down, you know, it's a lazy"
38:18;38:20;"Sunday and everything is going"
38:20;38:22;"really smoothly. But basically, the"
38:22;38:24;"conservative just wants to be sure"
38:24;38:26;"that we're all moving at"
38:26;38:28;"a pace that's going to keep the engine from"
38:28;38:30;"exploding. And, you know, again,"
38:30;38:32;"that's very particular to me, but it's always"
38:32;38:34;"made a lot of sense to me for this reason."
38:34;38:36;"I believe"
38:36;38:38;"people on the left and people"
38:38;38:40;"on the right have really different"
38:40;38:42;"dispositions and tendencies,"
38:42;38:44;"and they actually kind of need each"
38:44;38:46;"other. So I think of people"
38:46;38:48;"on the left as being people who are"
38:48;38:50;"outraged by injustice. They"
38:50;38:52;"see injustice, they see imperfections"
38:52;38:54;"in the world, they're like, ""We've got to fix it."""
38:54;38:56;"Whereas people on the right,"
38:56;38:58;"I think of them as being motivated by a sense"
38:58;39:00;"of gratitude, but also"
39:00;39:02;"a sense of fear. The gratitude is,"
39:02;39:04;"""Wow, things could be"
39:04;39:06;"so much worse."" It's kind of a miracle"
39:06;39:08;"that we live in a society in which people are not"
39:08;39:10;"constantly at each other's throats,"
39:10;39:12;"and we need to be"
39:12;39:14;"really careful about changing things in dramatic"
39:14;39:16;"ways, because that might actually"
39:16;39:18;"screw up some of the"
39:18;39:20;"things that make our society secure"
39:20;39:22;"and stable. But the thing is that if"
39:22;39:24;"the society were just made of conservatives,"
39:24;39:26;"then we wouldn't have people who are outraged"
39:26;39:28;"in really good, constructive"
39:28;39:30;"ways. So for you personally,"
39:30;39:32;"with certain things, certain injustices"
39:32;39:34;"that people on the left are outraged by,"
39:34;39:36;"say, you know,"
39:36;39:38;"racial disparities,"
39:38;39:40;"the way that minority groups are treated,"
39:40;39:42;"you don't think they're wrong to be outraged"
39:42;39:44;"by that? Yeah, I don't think that people are"
39:44;39:46;"necessarily wrong, but it's more a matter of"
39:46;39:48;"what's actually the right question."
39:48;39:50;"So the right question"
39:50;39:52;"to me is not necessarily,"
39:52;39:54;"""Hey, is this bad?"" More"
39:54;39:56;"the right question is, ""Okay, let's try to think"
39:56;39:58;"about things holistically, how things fit"
39:58;40:00;"together, and how some kinds of"
40:00;40:02;"change take a lot of time."
40:02;40:04;"They unfold over time,"
40:04;40:06;"and also sometimes change requires"
40:06;40:08;"building up some level of"
40:08;40:10;"trust. Sometimes societies"
40:10;40:12;"need to be more cohesive."
40:12;40:14;"You need societies that have more solidarity,"
40:14;40:16;"and at other times you have societies that have"
40:16;40:18;"excessive cohesion and solidarity,"
40:18;40:20;"and you actually need"
40:20;40:22;"to do more to make the society"
40:22;40:24;"more individualistic and more dynamic."
40:24;40:26;"How can you have too much solidarity? Sounds like a good thing."
40:26;40:28;"Well, too much solidarity could mean"
40:28;40:30;"a lot of different things, right? I mean, too much solidarity"
40:30;40:32;"could be a society like America"
40:32;40:34;"in the 1950s, where you had a lot"
40:34;40:36;"of people who were like, ""Hey, we have a common"
40:36;40:38;"identity. That's really great."""
40:38;40:40;"But then if you were a homosexual,"
40:40;40:42;"or if you belonged to some other minority groups that"
40:42;40:44;"weren't part of it, or also, at the time"
40:44;40:46;"of the New Deal, when America was at"
40:46;40:48;"its most solidaristic, politically"
40:48;40:50;"arguably, that was also a time when"
40:50;40:52;"America's borders were closed."
40:52;40:54;"I'm of the view that right now"
40:54;40:56;"in American society, we've gone"
40:56;40:58;"a little bit too far in the direction"
40:58;41:00;"of hyper-individualism, and that"
41:00;41:02;"we need more cohesion and solidarity."
41:02;41:04;"But there are a lot of other people who are like, ""Wait a"
41:04;41:06;"second. There are actually a lot of people who are really"
41:06;41:08;"oppressed by the demands of"
41:08;41:10;"solidarity."" Or people think about this in lots"
41:10;41:12;"of different ways. But I just see this as a trade-off."
41:12;41:14;"And so the thing that's a little"
41:14;41:16;"frustrating for people is that"
41:16;41:18;"I actually don't believe that"
41:18;41:20;"my side has all"
41:20;41:22;"the right answers or whatever else. Rather,"
41:22;41:24;"I basically believe they're trade-offs."
41:24;41:26;"When I think about the political"
41:26;41:28;"spectrum, when I think about political debates,"
41:28;41:30;"I think of it as there are people"
41:30;41:32;"who are like, ""OK, they're trade-offs."
41:32;41:34;"And maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right,"
41:34;41:36;"but I'm trying to get the mix of trade-offs right."""
41:36;41:38;"And there are other people who are really, really"
41:38;41:40;"confident that, ""Hey, we have the right"
41:40;41:42;"answers, and it's"
41:42;41:44;"actually just the bourgeoisie, or it's"
41:44;41:46;"just these crazy, horrible communists"
41:46;41:48;"or whoever else who is trying to"
41:48;41:50;"keep us from getting to the promised land."""
41:50;41:52;"And they think that, for example,"
41:52;41:54;"I don't know if you saw the movie ""Waiting for Superman."""
41:54;41:56;"It's a movie about charter schools."
41:56;41:58;"And what drove me crazy about that movie"
41:58;42:00;"is they're like, ""Hey, we know exactly"
42:00;42:02;"how to fix the schools. We know what's"
42:02;42:04;"going to make them perfect. It's the teachers' unions"
42:04;42:06;"that are getting in the way. And if only we got rid of those guys,"
42:06;42:08;"we'd have perfect schools."" And I'm like, ""Whoa,"
42:08;42:10;"slow down there."" I mean, I actually"
42:10;42:12;"have lots of criticisms of teachers' unions,"
42:12;42:14;"like a lot of conservatives do, but the"
42:14;42:16;"idea, the conceit that we know exactly"
42:16;42:18;"what to do because some charter"
42:18;42:20;"school in Houston or whatever figured it out,"
42:20;42:22;"I just think that's dangerously wrong."
42:22;42:24;"And that's kind of where"
42:24;42:26;"I'm coming from. And I think it relates"
42:26;42:28;"to this question of what's a liberal to."
42:28;42:30;"- Well, I was going to say, the idea that"
42:30;42:32;"it rubbed you the wrong way to see"
42:32;42:34;"a labor union being attacked"
42:34;42:36;"by people who"
42:36;42:38;"thought they knew the right way around it,"
42:38;42:40;"that sounds like something that you and the socialists would agree on."
42:40;42:42;"- I mean, the way that I see it,"
42:42;42:44;"socialists who believe in trade-offs, who are like,"
42:44;42:46;"""Hey, we want to make our society a lot more"
42:46;42:48;"egalitarian, but it's going to mean"
42:48;42:50;"some trade-offs in dynamism."
42:50;42:52;"It's going to mean some sacrifice"
42:52;42:54;"of this or that"
42:54;42:56;"other priority we might have."" That's a socialist."
42:56;42:58;"I'm like, ""Okay, cool. We can have a conversation."""
42:58;43:00;"But the thing that I'll"
43:00;43:02;"disagree with is the libertarian or"
43:02;43:04;"the socialist who is like, ""We have"
43:04;43:06;"a straight-up, straightforward"
43:06;43:08;"agenda for human perfection,"
43:08;43:10;"and the only"
43:10;43:12;"problem is these people who just don't get it."""
43:12;43:14;"And that's what I reject."
43:14;43:16;"So vis-a-vis labor unions, I mean, I have all kinds"
43:16;43:18;"of problems with labor unions. - Well, so it sounds"
43:18;43:20;"like you respect people"
43:20;43:22;"who keep it real. So, Ryan,"
43:22;43:24;"one last question for you. So,"
43:24;43:26;"Jake and I, and I imagine a lot of the Time Crisis"
43:26;43:28;"listeners, we're definitely going"
43:28;43:30;"to be on the left. As smart"
43:30;43:32;"as you are, we're never going to be conservative. So, just from a"
43:32;43:34;"conservative viewpoint, if"
43:34;43:36;"we're looking at our buffet table of options,"
43:36;43:38;"from a conservative"
43:38;43:40;"viewpoint, who do you respect more?"
43:40;43:42;"The socialists or the liberals?"
43:42;43:44;"- Oh, wow."
43:46;43:48;"I'd say that..."
43:48;43:50;"- Or to make it even easier, Bernie Sanders,"
43:50;43:52;"Hillary Clinton."
43:52;43:54;"- Well, okay. I"
43:54;43:56;"just want to say that basically anyone"
43:56;43:58;"who believes that there are trade-offs"
43:58;44:00;"and who believes that the decisions we're making"
44:00;44:02;"aren't no-brainers,"
44:02;44:04;"I respect those people. I"
44:04;44:06;"really respect socialists"
44:06;44:08;"who believe that, ""Yeah, my"
44:08;44:10;"socialist utopia is going to"
44:10;44:12;"involve some dark times"
44:12;44:14;"for certain groups of people."""
44:14;44:16;"I really"
44:16;44:18;"respect that. - Well, I think that's something we could"
44:18;44:20;"all agree with over here on Time Crisis."
44:20;44:22;"Thank you so much for calling in, Raihan. - Thank you."
44:22;44:24;"- Thanks for taking the time. We'll talk to you soon. - Yeah, thanks a lot."
44:24;44:26;"Talk to you later. - Bye, guys."

46:58;46:59;"some of his articles this week."
46:59;47:00;"- Yeah."
47:00;47:02;"- And he'd write articles like,"
47:02;47:06;"""I hate Donald Trump, but I'm not leaving the GOP."""
47:06;47:08;"- He seems like a very pragmatic dude."
47:08;47:10;"Like every time we'd ask him a question,"

47:26;47:31;"that any politician or party or ideological group"
47:31;47:35;"that tells you that there's a simple fix for everything"
47:35;47:36;"is probably pulling your leg?"
47:36;47:37;"- Yeah."
47:37;47:39;"- But doesn't every political party do that?"
47:39;47:41;"- It was interesting what Ryan was saying"
47:41;47:44;"at the beginning about the conservatives"
47:44;47:46;"are grounded in the sense of gratitude,"
47:46;47:48;"that they don't wanna crash the car."
47:48;47:49;"- Right."
47:49;47:51;"- And I was like, I could see that applying"
47:51;47:54;"to more old school conservatism,"
47:54;47:58;"but I don't see that with the current iteration."
47:58;48:00;"The Democrats seem much more the party"
48:00;48:04;"that feels a sense of infidelity to a set of values."

48:23;48:25;"- So she was way more like, we're driving,"
48:25;48:26;"don't crash the car."
48:26;48:26;"- Yeah."
48:26;48:28;"- That was kind of her whole campaign a little bit,"

49:45;49:47;"- Life was better."
49:47;49:48;"- Life was better then."
49:48;49:51;"On the last show, we did a close read"
49:51;49:53;"of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah."
49:53;49:55;"Found out a few things there."
49:55;49:58;"One, Jake will certainly be going to hell"
49:58;49:59;"as a non-believer."
49:59;50:00;"- That's true."
50:00;50:02;"- An atheist."
50:02;50:04;"Also, that Jake doesn't care about lyrics."
50:04;50:06;"Not a lyrics guy."
50:06;50:08;"- Did I say that?"
50:08;50:09;"- You did say that."
50:09;50:09;"- Not a lyrics guy."
50:09;50:11;"- Not a lyrics guy."
50:11;50:13;"But that said, I'll tell you one thing"
50:13;50:16;"that Jake does like, talking."
50:16;50:17;"Is that fair to say?"
50:17;50:18;"- Yeah."
50:18;50:20;"- Don't love lyrics, but you love going deep on stuff."
50:20;50:21;"- Yeah."
50:21;50:21;"- In conversation."
50:21;50:22;"- Sure."
50:22;50:23;"- You had the idea."
50:23;50:27;"- Well, you had suggested that we talk about liberalism."
50:27;50:28;"- Yeah."
50:28;50:30;"- And actually, the Leonard Cohen conversation"
50:30;50:31;"was sort of resonating with me."
50:31;50:36;"And then I happened to catch John Lennon's Imagine"
50:36;50:38;"on the radio."
50:38;50:41;"And for whatever reason, the lyrics really--"
50:41;50:41;"- They hit you?"
50:41;50:43;"- Jumped out to me."
50:43;50:44;"And I've always loved the song."
50:44;50:45;"It's a beautiful song."
50:45;50:48;"- Just harmonically and melodically?"
50:48;50:50;"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
50:50;50:51;"I love the palette, you know me."
50:51;50:53;"- Beautiful early '70s palette."
50:53;50:56;"- And I have to say, I always loved the sentiment."
50:56;50:57;"It was one of those songs where I was like,"
50:57;50:59;"God, that's a beautiful sentiment."
50:59;51:02;"I love how he espouses these universal values."
51:02;51:03;"- Right."
51:03;51:05;"- And then I was hearing it anew after Trump."
51:05;51:06;"- Right."
51:06;51:08;"- And then we were talking about our upcoming"
51:08;51:09;"conversation on liberalism, and I was like,"
51:09;51:12;"actually, this song is like a liberal's wet dream."
51:12;51:15;"It became very clear to me that someone could hear"
51:15;51:18;"this song and be like, that sounds terrible."
51:18;51:19;"- Well."
51:19;51:21;"- We can get into it, start the song."
51:21;51:22;"- Let's get right into it."
51:22;51:23;"- Let's just get into the song."
51:23;51:24;"- For those of you who don't know, this is John Lennon."
51:24;51:27;"He was a member of the Beatles."
51:27;51:29;"- Basically, it's like an anti-materialistic,"
51:29;51:34;"atheist, globalist, anti-nationalist song."
51:34;51:35;"- Okay."
51:35;51:38;"- And he was looking at it, kind of brutal,"
51:38;51:41;"in a cartoonishly red state perspective."
51:41;51:43;"- Well, let's see what he was actually saying."
51:43;51:46;"(piano music)"
51:46;51:55;"- Beautiful."
51:55;52:02;"♪ Imagine there's no heaven ♪"

52:24;52:26;"It's easy if you try."
52:26;52:27;"- No hell below us."
52:27;52:29;"- Above us only sky."
52:29;52:32;"So, all right, so yeah, right off the bat,"
52:32;52:33;"I see what you're saying."
52:33;52:34;"There's kind of an atheist vibe."
52:34;52:36;"- Yeah, it's just like, above us is only sky."
52:36;52:38;"It's just, it's just the ether."
52:38;52:39;"It's nothingness."
52:39;52:40;"- Right."
52:40;52:41;"- I love it."
52:41;52:44;"I am a liberal."
52:44;52:45;"I'm not religious."
52:45;52:46;"- Yeah."
52:46;52:49;"- I could see that, just like someone hearing that"
52:49;52:52;"and just being like, why would I want to imagine that?"
52:52;52:55;"Bad people go to hell, I'm going to heaven."
52:55;52:56;"What?"
52:56;52:58;"There's nothing above us, it's only sky?"
52:58;52:58;"That's what?"
52:58;52:59;"- We gotta see where he goes with it,"
52:59;53:02;"but another way to think about it,"
53:02;53:04;"it could be nihilist, too."
53:04;53:06;"Sometimes some religious people be like,"
53:06;53:10;"I have a set of values, I walk the line"
53:10;53:15;"because I know that if I don't follow the rules"
53:15;53:17;"of my religion, I'll be punished."
53:17;53:20;"And I know if I do follow the rules, I'll get reward."
53:20;53:22;"'Cause that's kind of based on this idea"
53:22;53:25;"that the human behavior can be nudged"
53:25;53:28;"in the right direction by rewarding somebody,"
53:28;53:29;"as you do with a child."
53:29;53:30;"- Sure, or a pet."
53:30;53:31;"- Or even just a buddy."
53:31;53:34;"Come to the party, taco's on me, and I'll drive you home."
53:34;53:35;"- It's gonna be a good time."
53:35;53:37;"- It's gonna be a good time."
53:37;53:40;"So some people think that if there's no heaven or hell,"
53:40;53:42;"why do anything?"
53:42;53:43;"- Yeah."
53:43;53:44;"- That's another way to look at it."
53:44;53:45;"- Well, they would still hear that"
53:45;53:47;"and be like, it's terrible."
53:47;53:48;"- Well, yeah, they might, okay,"
53:48;53:49;"so we gotta see where he goes with it."

59:04;59:06;"I'm not trying to crap on the song too hard,"

59:11;59:13;"- Whoa, wait. - It really rang empty to me."
59:13;59:16;"- You know, I was gonna say, my gut would be,"
59:16;59:18;"'cause John, he was like the edgy Beatle."
59:18;59:19;"- Yeah. - He was like"
59:19;59:21;"the badass one at J. Edgar Hoover."
59:21;59:23;"He had an FBI file on him."
59:23;59:25;"I would've guessed, if John was a liberal"
59:25;59:28;"or a socialist, I would guess he was a socialist."
59:28;59:30;"But then I think back to the song Revolution,"
59:30;59:32;"that was actually kind of from a liberal perspective,"

59:42;59:43;"John was all over the place."

59:44;59:48;"I actually watched a video on YouTube from that era."
59:48;59:49;"It's almost like a music video."
59:49;59:50;"I'm not sure what it was from,"

01:00:03;01:00:09;"- To be fair, they were the first of their kind."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"You know, like the '60s,"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"this big kind of cultural revolution happening?"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"They were like the first liberal,"
01:00:16;01:00:20;"rich from selling rock records and art couple."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"So if they made a few rookie mistakes"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"that today a rock power couple might not make,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"a certain type of naive mistake,"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"you gotta also remember that there was no playbook for them."

01:00:39;01:00:41;"- A rock power couple today would be very,"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"I would probably bash on them"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"for not being more like Lennon and Yoko."
01:00:45;01:00:48;"- For instance, I mean, they're no longer a power couple,"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"but they had a conscious uncoupling,"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"but Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow,"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"I think a lot of people felt they were"
01:00:53;01:00:56;"the John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Vardy."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"And I like Coldplay, and they're both lovely people,"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"but I'm picturing them like,"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Chris Martin is also a very earnest person"
01:01:03;01:01:07;"who believes in peace and unity and stuff,"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"but that guy gets (beep) all the time."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"If Chris Martin came out,"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"if John Lennon never written Imagine--"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"- Yeah, if Chris Martin wrote Imagine--"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"- And he wrote Imagine today,"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"even with the same gorgeous '70s palette,"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"he went to England, he went to Abbey Road or whatever,"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"he recorded it to tape."
01:01:23;01:01:23;"- It wouldn't read."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"- It wouldn't read."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"John Lennon was getting props for this back in the day"
01:01:26;01:01:29;"from like cool people, I bet."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"If Chris Martin dropped it the exact same song,"

01:01:36;01:01:37;"- And it's sad about our culture"

01:10:31;01:10:35;"- Any time crisis listener, but just in case you don't know,"
01:10:35;01:10:38;"he was an inventor, an American inventor"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"in the tradition of Thomas Edison."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"- And in the tradition of Richard Montanez."
01:10:42;01:10:45;"- And Richard Montanez invented Flaming Hot Cheetos."

01:11:53;01:11:56;"Then he went on to open 45 more franchises"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"of McDonald's around Pennsylvania."

01:12:19;01:12:21;"- Well, yeah, to be fair, Richard Montanez,"

01:12:23;01:12:24;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Lower on the totem pole."
01:12:25;01:12:29;"- Michael James Deligatti was a owner in a sense."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"- A partial owner, owning 47 franchises."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"But so that's funny to imagine a time where,"

01:12:59;01:13:01;"- It's coming from corporate."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"- Oh yeah."
01:13:02;01:13:02;"- You know, can you imagine, like,"
01:13:02;01:13:06;"I guess you can still be a McDonald's franchisee."
01:13:06;01:13:07;"- Yeah, absolutely."
01:13:07;01:13:08;"- So it's like if you and I just wanted to open"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"a McDonald's, we just saw like a hole in the market"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"in, you know, some part of like rural Montana."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"If we opened our own McDonald's,"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"I bet we'd probably sign a document that says"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"you're gonna like--"
01:13:19;01:13:20;"- Play ball."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"- You're gonna play ball."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"It's not like you can open a McDonald's these days"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"and be like, you know what, man, at my McDonald's,"
01:13:27;01:13:31;"you can get blue cheese sauce."
01:13:31;01:13:31;"- On your lobster roll."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"- On your lobster roll."
01:13:33;01:13:37;"- Michael Delagatti did face some uphill battles with this."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"He got--"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- So he invented it and he had to run up the flagpole?"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"- He had the idea."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"He was like, what about we do like a double patty thing"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"with like a cool sauce?"
01:13:45;01:13:50;"And then he got, you know, like a rad sauce,"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"not just like ketchup."
01:13:51;01:13:55;"And he like was buddies with a regional manager"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"based out of Ohio who had a good relationship"
01:13:58;01:13:58;"with the higher ups."
01:13:58;01:14:02;"And he ran out the flagpole and the higher ups in 1967"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"were like, okay, give it a shot."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"I don't think that would happen today."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"So he had the idea for the double patty."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"He bought the buns locally,"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"hand cut them into three different sections."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"- Hand cut."
01:14:16;01:14:17;"You know, that's also a problem with today."
01:14:17;01:14:20;"And I'm sure that the socialists would agree here"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"is that we have such a divide."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"You know, you always see those charts that say like"
01:14:24;01:14:28;"back in the fifties, a CEO made maybe like 15 times"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"as much as like a regular average Joe employee."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"And that's constantly growing."
01:14:33;01:14:37;"So back in the day, this guy owned some franchises."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"He'd actually, you know, get in the kitchen,"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"roll his sleeves up and start hand cutting patties,"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"inventing stuff."
01:14:43;01:14:44;"- Yeah."

01:14:58;01:15:00;"- One other interesting thing it says in the article"
01:15:00;01:15:03;"is that as we know, all great inventors,"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"it usually starts with a need."
01:15:06;01:15:11;"Like Thomas Edison, he couldn't read at night"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"'cause candlelight was dim."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"So he was like, we need something to brighten up the room."
01:15:17;01:15:19;"Then he invents light bulbs."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"You know, usually there's a question or a need."
01:15:21;01:15:24;"So in the case of the Big Mac,"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"comparably important invention,"
01:15:27;01:15:32;"the question was how do we put a dent in the sales"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"of Burger King's Whopper?"
01:15:34;01:15:38;"- Which is not a double patty burger, but--"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"- No, but it was a big boy."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"It was something more substantial"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"than these tiny little McDonald's burgers."
01:15:44;01:15:46;"- Yeah, 'cause those burgers are like eighth of a pound."
01:15:46;01:15:47;"They're tiny."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"- Yeah, so this is like an arms race in a way."
01:15:49;01:15:53;"So McDonald's is making their skanky little burgers."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"And then all of a sudden Burger King,"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"who probably at that time were like a real competitor."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"- Still are."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"- Still are, but you know."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"And then they come out with this thing called a Whopper."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"Now they've got a specialty burger."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"And imagine you're just like a guy in the 60s"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"and you're like, where you wanna go today, Joe?"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"McDonald's or Burger King?"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Burger King, you're like, yeah, I heard over at Burger King"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"they got this new thing called a Whopper."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Oh, what's the story?"
01:16:14;01:16:15;"It's kind of like a more substantial burger."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Oh, I'd love to try that out."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"Let's go."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"So already Burger King ups the ante."
01:16:21;01:16:25;"And then McDonald's, now this is very smart"
01:16:25;01:16:29;"because sometimes your competitor might come out"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"with a thicker burger."
01:16:31;01:16:35;"Now, and a kind of basic businessman would say,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"oh, let's throw our own thicker burger on the menu."
01:16:37;01:16:41;"So that next time somebody wants a Whopper,"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"they say, well, we can also go to McDonald's"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"and get a Slopper."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"It's very similar."
01:16:45;01:16:48;"No, you take what they did and you up the ante."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"So you do a double patty."

01:23:49;01:23:54;"- It's time for the top five, five on iTunes."
01:23:54;01:23:57;"- Okay, so this week we're gonna compare"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"the current top five songs on iTunes"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"to the top five Billboard hits this year, 1967."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Why?"
01:24:03;01:24:07;"Because that was the year that the Big Mac was introduced."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"- Invented, not introduced."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"- Oh, invented."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"- Introduced in '68, which is really,"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"obviously the real kind of spiritual core of this show."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"- Oh, okay, well we're going back one year."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"- We're gonna go one year earlier."
01:24:18;01:24:21;"- This one is for Michael James Delegati."
01:24:21;01:24:23;"So the year that he was inventing the Big Mac."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"The number five song on the charts"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"while he was tinkering away in his test kitchen"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"was Gladys Knight and the Pips,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I Heard It Through the Grapevine."
01:24:33;01:24:36;"- I don't know this version."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"- I know the Marvin Gaye one."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- Oh yeah, I guess the bar one."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- Yeah, I don't know this one as well."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"- I guess I kinda know it."
01:24:53;01:25:18;"- Michael Legoliddy, what is his name?"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"- Michael James Delegati."
01:25:21;01:25:25;"- Michael James Delegati, sweating it out in his kitchen."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"One part mayonnaise, one part ketchup."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"- This would actually be--"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- One part mustard."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- I know we always say this,"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"but this would be the perfect montage music for just like,"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"I mean, this is a classic,"
01:25:39;01:25:40;"there's always that part in the movie,"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"like in the first third, where it's like,"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"well, let's get to work and try this thing, man."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"- Montage?"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"- Yeah, he's like, he's sweating."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"There'd be like some funny moment,"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"like his son comes in,"
01:25:50;01:25:51;"or like you see time passing,"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"like the wife comes down,"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"1 a.m., you can't hear what they're saying,"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"he's like, ""Whoa."""
01:25:55;01:25:57;"- Yeah, she's pregnant,"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"and then like smash cut,"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"like the next scene, she's holding the baby."
01:26:00;01:26:02;"- Yeah, she's still holding the baby behind him,"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"but he's still tinkering on the Big Mac."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"- Yeah."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"- Could be a good movie."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"- Founder, dude, Founder's coming out."
01:26:08;01:26:11;"- Yeah, felt like it should've come out already."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"- I think it's coming out like now."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"What's up with the Oscars?"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"They wait forever for these movies to come out."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"It's insane."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- I don't know, man."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"- They released like 15 movies"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"in the last like week of the year."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"- Oscars feels so irrelevant."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"- Yeah, no, it's insane."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Anyways."
