00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back once again. We face time during the crisis to make the crisis"
00:07;00:16;"feel a little shorter, a little less time to be in a time crisis. Anyway, on this"
00:16;00:22;"episode we're talking once again about Chunky Dunkies, plus Burger King, Jonah"
00:22;00:33;"Hill, Jersey Shore, LA Takedown, and cars. Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:19;01:24;"Time Crisis back once again. How you doing, Jake? Good. I shaved off my beard"
01:24;01:30;"today. Yeah, look at you, hand shaving. Yeah, unusual for me the last few years, but it's getting hot."
01:30;01:35;"I felt like the move. In previous summers you just went with beard? I feel like I've"
01:35;01:40;"just been beard like 90% of the time the last like two or three years. Does that"
01:40;01:44;"sound right to you? Like if you picture me, do you picture me with a beard? Well, I"
01:44;01:47;"think I'll always picture you without a beard actually, because I've just known"
01:47;01:55;"you longer. How long have we known each other now? About 15? Yeah, that's weird."
01:55;02:02;"Yeah, no, I think literally 15, because... Yeah, '05. Yeah, '05. Meanwhile, Seinfeld"
02:02;02:06;"appears to be growing a beard. Hey, what's up? Hey, man. You got a beard now? A little"
02:06;02:09;"bit, you know, I've never really been able to grow a beard. That looks like a pretty"
02:09;02:13;"full beard, actually. You know, I think that I just never gave it enough time"
02:13;02:16;"before. I got impatient, or I'd be like, ""Ah, it's been two weeks, I can't grow a"
02:16;02:21;"beard. I'm done."" And sometimes you just need to, you need to wait a little. It's"
02:21;02:26;"also not very Seinfeld to have a beard. None of the the male leads on Seinfeld"
02:26;02:30;"ever had beards on the show, right? Yeah, there is an episode that opens with"
02:30;02:34;"George and Jerry both having grown mustaches, and it's just kind of like a"
02:34;02:39;"visual, it's like a sight gag, and then they, they're like, they both decide that"
02:39;02:42;"it's just not them, and then I think Kramer later on is like, ""Oh, we're not"
02:42;02:46;"doing that anymore."" Can you guys think of any sitcom character that has a beard?"
02:46;02:53;"Sure. Owl from Home Improvement. Okay, good call. Although that's a very specific"
02:53;02:58;"role. Yeah, how about like the lead, the lead of a show with a beard? I guess I"
02:58;03:04;"picture, um, the dad from Family Ties. Right. I'm already like a little bit young"
03:04;03:08;"for that show. I saw it in reruns, but for people who don't remember or weren't"
03:08;03:14;"around at all, that was an 80s show that was about two middle-aged former hippie"
03:14;03:19;"parents raising their kids in the 80s, so they're kind of liberal, and then they"
03:19;03:24;"have this one son, famously played by Michael J. Fox, who is Alex P. Keaton."
03:24;03:31;"That's also a line from, um, Time Crisis Favorite, Summer Girls by LFO. I feel"
03:31;03:35;"like he was all like preppy and yuppie, he'd wear like a tie, they'd be like"
03:35;03:38;"sitting around in their kind of like little crunchy kitchen, and he would just"
03:38;03:43;"be like looking at the paper, just be like, ""Dad, Dad, Ronald Reagan, he's doing"
03:43;03:46;"wonders for the stock market."" And anyway, I think that dad had a beard because he"
03:46;03:52;"was like, he had that look of like a aging hippie dad in the 80s. I wonder if"
03:52;03:55;"that show would be interesting to re-watch. I'm sure there'd be some cool"
03:55;04:00;"cultural references. In fact, I'm starting to become like so monomaniacal,"
04:00;04:03;"but the first thing that just flipped through my head was, ""I wonder if there's"
04:03;04:07;"any references to The Grateful Dead on Family Ties."" I think, like, maybe the other"
04:07;04:10;"daughter, she was more down with the parents, but I could just picture them"
04:10;04:15;"being like, ""All right, you're finally old enough to babysit, Alex, like, we're going"
04:15;04:20;"out. This is our big weekend."" And he's just like, ""Dad, I can't believe you guys"
04:20;04:26;"still come to see The Grateful Dead. I mean, are you kidding me?"" And then the dad"
04:26;04:32;"starts gloating like, ""Listen, Touch of Grey, it's a top ten Billboard hit."" Yeah, but come on, dad."
04:32;04:37;"Old guys still got it. It's old stuff, man. I like New Wave. I like Huey Lewis and"
04:37;04:41;"the News. Way more modern with their use of drum sounds and synths. Well, hold on, Alex."
04:41;04:46;"Jerry's actually been doing some interesting MIDI effects, especially"
04:46;04:51;"during the Space Jam. That would be pretty tight. That really seems like that"
04:51;04:56;"would have been a joke on Family Ties. On the Alex B. Keaton Wikipedia page, it"
04:56;05:01;"says that he enjoys music of the big band and swing era. Oh my god. But secretly"
05:01;05:08;"enjoys rock music. Oh my god, rock is too out there. So he's so conservative that"
05:08;05:12;"it's not even like he's old versus new. He's like, ""I gotta tell you,"" to his"
05:12;05:16;"parents, just like, ""You guys with your whole hippie acid thing, you ruined"
05:16;05:22;"popular music. I liked, you know, the big band era."" Yeah, he's rejecting all post-war"
05:22;05:27;"culture. I gotta say, dad, I'm really not feeling your whole post-war culture, man."
05:27;05:32;"I guess that kind of tracks like an 80s kid who's like into waltz, like,"
05:32;05:39;"following the stock market, wearing ties, and he just wants to listen to big band"
05:39;05:44;"music. Like the Glenn Miller Orchestra? Yeah, he's probably not even into like"
05:44;05:49;"the cooler stuff. Just that Glenn Miller. He had a killer band. Miles Davis and"
05:49;05:53;"Coltrane? Way too far out. No, that's crazy. Yeah, he's not even into like Duke"
05:53;05:57;"Ellington. No, and also, yeah, he's probably like racist too. Just like, I'll"
05:57;06:02;"tell you, man. Best jazz musicians? Glenn Miller. But actually, Glenn Miller is a"
06:02;06:05;"respected jazz musician. I don't really know what I'm talking about. Anyway, Alex B."
06:05;06:09;"Keaton, kind of a stand-in. But yeah, the dad on that show had a beard. But I feel"
06:09;06:12;"like actually it's not a good answer to your question to start throwing out"
06:12;06:18;"various sitcom dads. Was there ever like a 20-something sitcom guy with like a"
06:18;06:22;"beard? Or that just like would read as too old? Yeah, and I'm not up on the new"
06:22;06:26;"sitcoms at all, so I don't know. I feel like beards... Is it fair to say that"
06:26;06:32;"beards are more common in society today than they were 30 or 40 years ago? Like"
06:32;06:36;"now, it's like I feel like most baseball players have beards. But back when I was"
06:36;06:39;"growing up, it was rare for a baseball player to have a beard. There's the way"
06:39;06:46;"in which beards are kind of, fairly or not, but associated with kind of like the"
06:46;06:51;"2000s hipster culture. And then there's this thing about like, yeah, like kind of"
06:51;06:57;"a Portlandia guy who puts oil in his beard. It was considered a trend that"
06:57;07:03;"kind of had something to do with the neo-hipster, put a bird on it,"
07:03;07:07;"Portlandia, Decembrist kind of thing. I'm not saying that's fair, but that was a"
07:07;07:10;"stereotype. I'm not saying I agree. Do you think that that stereotype was reaching"
07:10;07:17;"the like broader population, like in the suburbs? Yes, I think it's trickle-down"
07:17;07:22;"hipsterism. When I picture this kind of mid-2000s hipsterism, which Vampire"
07:22;07:25;"Weekend maybe like vaguely intersects with, but not exactly. It's like a"
07:25;07:30;"different school. I picture this kind of, there was like a store in New York, it's"
07:30;07:34;"probably still there, called Freeman's Alley. There was a store and a restaurant"
07:34;07:37;"there that had a little bit, it was the first time that I at least had"
07:37;07:45;"experienced this kind of like neo-lumberjack, like fancy pickles, 19th"
07:45;07:51;"century cocktail comeback sh*t, sepia-toned pictures on the wall. You know, whatever"
07:51;07:56;"you call that, that kind of like 19th century revival hipster thing. And I'm"
07:56;07:58;"sure, I don't want to be too New York-centric, I'm sure there are also"
07:58;08:05;"versions of that popping up in London or Montreal. Austin. Yeah, I know it's not"
08:05;08:08;"New York, didn't invent it. I just happen to be in this one big city. And then I"
08:08;08:12;"started going on tour and I could just see like clockwork as suddenly like, okay"
08:12;08:15;"so picture like a restaurant like that, that's in one of these hipster cities,"
08:15;08:18;"that's just like, you go there for the first time, you're like, what? You're"
08:18;08:23;"selling a $13 Bloody Marin? It's like, well sir, it has five oysters and hickory"
08:23;08:27;"smoked bacon, you know like all that sh*t. And you go, wow. And then meanwhile, in the"
08:27;08:31;"other towns, you just have your standard bar and grill. And these places couldn't"
08:31;08:35;"be more different. It's night and day. One place is the $14 crazy Bloody Marin,"
08:35;08:39;"the other place is just like, we're not into that bullsh*t. But I'll say over the"
08:39;08:44;"decades, as I started to tour and see more of the world, those things converged"
08:44;08:49;"a little bit. And now a lot of cities have a bar and grill that you might even"
08:49;08:53;"go watch the game at, but it actually wouldn't be that crazy if they had some"
08:53;08:59;"wild $13 Bloody Mary with hickory smoked bacon that came in a Mason jar. You know"
08:59;09:02;"what I mean? It all kind of converged a little bit. Yeah. And obviously I'm"
09:02;09:07;"talking about food and beverages, but I think stylistically, there's a look that"
09:07;09:13;"in 2003, 2004, you would have found in the Vice magazine do's and don'ts"
09:13;09:18;"section that would have seemed like, who's this kooky dude paying $350 a month for"
09:18;09:23;"his apartment in Williamsburg with a wax in his mustache, riding a bike,"
09:23;09:28;"wearing some weird old thrift store Hawaiian shirt kind of thing. And"
09:28;09:33;"then I feel like now you might see that guy just sitting in the stand at"
09:33;09:39;"a baseball game anywhere in the country. And that guy literally could not give"
09:39;09:43;"less of a f*ck about Williamsburg, New York or Portland culture. You know what I mean?"
09:43;09:49;"I feel like beards were maybe at their ebb in the 90s. And I remember when"
09:49;09:55;"Soundgarden came out and Kim Fahill, the guitar player, had a beard. I was like,"
09:55;10:01;"""Whoa, that is a trip."" A full beard, yeah. Yeah, he had a full-ass beard. But now"
10:01;10:06;"instead of like, rock band with a beard, yeah, no shocker there. But like, Fahill"
10:06;10:11;"with the beard, granted, it was a long beard. But it was like, ""Whoa."" I never had seen,"
10:11;10:16;"like, a contemporary musician in the 80s or 90s with a beard."
10:16;10:20;"-ZZ Top exclusive. -Obviously. That's true. But that was like novelty beard."
10:20;10:23;"Did we ever talk about the ZZ Top documentary on the program?"
10:23;10:25;"I don't think we have. I actually haven't seen it."
10:25;10:26;"Oh, are you kidding me?"
10:26;10:28;"It's a source of shame."
10:28;10:31;"[Laughter]"
10:31;10:36;"Actually, I feel like the Hank Azaria topic of who is the best American rock band,"
10:36;10:40;"which still keeps popping up because like on Twitter, people were tagging us that like,"
10:40;10:44;"on ESPN, there was a show where they're talking about it. Remember towards the end of our"
10:44;10:48;"conversation last week, this is actually week three of the topic, which is very impressive"
10:48;10:53;"for Time Crisis to really continue something. Remember we were kind of like zeroing in on"
10:53;10:58;"this point that America is so big that so many of our great bands, they're excellent,"
10:58;11:02;"but they feel regional. And the idea that they would represent the whole country is silly,"
11:02;11:06;"like Allman Brothers, Leonard Skinner, Southern Rock, whatever. What's really amazing about ZZ Top"
11:06;11:11;"and what's hilarious in the doc is that they kind of had this realization at a certain point that"
11:11;11:16;"they were like, ""We're going to put Texas on the map."" And they do this tour that's like the Texas"
11:16;11:21;"tour where they take Texas to the rest of the country. And they were like, bring in like,"
11:21;11:28;"they basically brought a rodeo to arenas, just like bring in like, you know, longhorns. And"
11:28;11:32;"like they had like a vulture on stage. - Wait, they brought like steer, like cattle?"
11:32;11:36;"- Yeah. And I think- - That was, wait, that's insane. I have"
11:36;11:39;"to watch this doc. - You got to watch it. It's amazing. And"
11:39;11:45;"also they're cool as hell. I always liked ZZ Top. I always liked playing Lagrange on Rock Band."
11:45;11:50;"That was like on the first, or no, Guitar Hero. And then you know who always was a big fan of"
11:50;11:55;"ZZ Top, like going back like 10 years ago was the Chromio guys. They're always just like,"
11:55;12:02;"their videos from the 80s are just a masterclass of just like storytelling and their songs are so"
12:02;12:07;"funny and cool. So anyway, ZZ Top is a really fascinating band, but I was thinking about how,"
12:07;12:13;"again, they're just such a Texas band and they owned it. The idea of saying like ZZ Top is the"
12:13;12:18;"American band, it's like Texas already is kind of like its own country. They leaned into that idea."
12:19;12:23;"So it's like, yeah, they own Texas. And there's so many bands like that,"
12:23;12:29;"these iconic American bands that are such exemplars and interpreters of the culture"
12:29;12:32;"of the place that they're from, but there's just so many."
12:32;12:35;"- I think that's kind of beautiful that there's still like regionalism."
12:35;12:38;"- Yeah. Well, unfortunately a lot of these bands are older. I think that-"
12:38;12:43;"- Yes, true. This is all 40 years ago, 50 years ago."
12:43;12:50;"- In the doc, they kind of imply that Texas, as we understand it today, which is like,"
12:50;12:57;"as far as like the mega brands of American states, we would put Texas as easily top five, right?"
12:57;12:59;"- I mean, maybe number one."
12:59;13:03;"- Maybe number one in some ways. I mean, California is a pretty strong global brand."
13:03;13:06;"- Yeah. It'd be California than Texas."
13:06;13:10;"- But they kind of imply in the doc, they're just like, listen, man, in the 70s,"
13:10;13:15;"like, you know, Texas just didn't have that kind of like the same rep. People from Texas,"
13:15;13:19;"of course, thought of it as being this unique culture. And of course there's famous from Texas,"
13:19;13:23;"but it just didn't quite have that California-esque like global brand. They're like,"
13:23;13:27;"it's easy to help put that together. Anyway, the reason I thought of it is because you were"
13:27;13:33;"talking about their beards, which obviously were like red as kind of like semi-ironic,"
13:33;13:37;"like whatever. But the actual story behind their beards, which they tell in the doc"
13:37;13:42;"is that after they did their big Texas tour, it's late 70s, everybody's burned out as f***."
13:42;13:46;"Three of them kind of go their separate ways. One of them goes to London,"
13:46;13:49;"starts checking in on the nascent punk rock scene."
13:49;13:50;"- Really?"
13:50;13:56;"- Another dude goes back to the work at the airport just to work a regular job and clear his head."
13:56;13:59;"- What was he doing at the airport? Like baggage handler?"
13:59;14:03;"- He was a baggage handler. And he was like, you know what? He's like, it was great, man."
14:03;14:07;"Because nobody treated me like nothing special. I was just working with the guys. We'd go get"
14:07;14:13;"a drink after work. It was great. But anyway, so they have this kind of year off after almost"
14:13;14:18;"burning out working so hard. And then they kind of come back together and two of the dudes just"
14:18;14:22;"have these long beards and they're just kind of like, hey, look at that. And that's like the"
14:22;14:25;"origin story is that they just took a year off. They're like, look at that. We both grew long"
14:25;14:31;"beards. And then famously, the third guy, the drummer who didn't have a beard, his last name"
14:31;14:31;"was Beard."
14:31;14:32;"- I love that."
14:32;14:56;"- (Music)"
14:56;15:00;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
15:00;15:03;"- But anyway, outside is easy, Top. You're right. There weren't a lot of beards. And when I think"
15:03;15:08;"of 90s facial hair, I'm picturing like a Chris Cornell, like a little goatee or like a small"
15:08;15:13;"little mustache with a soul patch. A big beard was not hot in the 90s."
15:13;15:15;"- The goatee was a funny vibe."
15:15;15:17;"- The goatee was very 90s."
15:17;15:23;"- I always had this like funny idea of like, what if like a major politician or like the"
15:23;15:24;"president had a goatee?"
15:24;15:26;"- (Laughter)"
15:26;15:30;"- Like, maybe I brought this up before the show. I just think it's the funniest thing."
15:30;15:36;"Like, what if like Bill Clinton in like 1997 just grew like a Mark McGuire style, like"
15:36;15:41;"goatee. It would be so weird."
15:41;15:46;"- When was the last time an American president was like routinely wearing a beard? Am I"
15:46;15:50;"forgetting something or do we have to go back to like 19th century? Like old timey, like"
15:50;15:52;"Rutherford and Hayes kind of sh*t."
15:52;15:57;"- I mean, what about just prominent politicians? I mean, it's just something about the beard"
15:57;15:59;"is still, you know."
15:59;16:01;"- Ted Cruz has a beard these days."
16:01;16:04;"- Oh yeah. And people were like very weirded out by it kind of."
16:04;16:07;"- Yeah, yeah. He caught some flack for that for sure."
16:07;16:11;"- He already weirds people out, but the beard just put it over the edge. I can picture like"
16:11;16:15;"the leader of like a smaller European nation having a goatee."
16:15;16:15;"- Yes."
16:15;16:19;"- Wait, Seinfeld. This is a tough one. So, you know, no harm, no foul if you can't"
16:19;16:23;"deliver, but can we get a number crunch on world leaders with goatees?"
16:23;16:28;"- Yeah, I'll get on that. I will say that there is a Wikipedia page devoted to US presidents"
16:28;16:34;"with facial hair as well. Also, Justin Trudeau is currently rocking a beard. Canadian prime"
16:34;16:34;"minister."
16:34;16:39;"- See, this, yeah, this goes to my theory that beards are fully, they're more ubiquitous"
16:39;16:40;"now than ever."
16:40;16:47;"- Here's also a very vague guess. Is it possible that like mass production of like disposable"
16:47;16:53;"razors and shaving cream and stuff, and obviously handheld razors in post-war America made it"
16:53;16:58;"much easier to shave and suddenly being clean shaven was like a symbol of like having your"
16:58;17:04;"(beep) together? When beards came back into fashion in the 2000s, there was this funny"
17:04;17:08;"thing that it didn't seem like, oh, getting back to like the crunchy 60s. It almost seemed"
17:08;17:12;"like it was getting back to like the 1890s. And I feel like people would joke about it."
17:12;17:18;"Like some of the beard styles, it connoted a full on different century. You know what"
17:18;17:18;"I mean?"
17:18;17:20;"- Yeah, it wasn't like a 60s hippie thing."
17:20;17:25;"- I think there was something that maybe, this is a total guess, but maybe starting"
17:25;17:31;"in the 50s, having a beard, like, and then the 60s, like mad men era. I think maybe if"
17:31;17:35;"you were like working in an office building, you had a beard, people would look at you"
17:35;17:39;"just like, kind of like, hey, Abraham Lincoln, you know, like how's the civil war going?"
17:39;17:39;"You know?"
17:39;17:40;"- Yeah."
17:40;17:43;"- Or you're like a weird bum or something."
17:43;17:49;"- Yeah, maybe it was kind of like, guys, you can go buy six disposable razors for a nickel."
17:49;17:50;"Get your (beep) together."
17:50;17:56;"- I just did a geopolitical number crunch here. And unfortunately, it seems like goatee"
17:56;18:02;"is too specific a facial hair designation for any article to focus just on goatees."
18:02;18:08;"I do have a lot of lists of world leaders with beards. And one of them does have like"
18:08;18:14;"a subcategory of goatees. And it's very rare. There are only four world leaders. This is"
18:14;18:20;"from 2014, mind you. But there are only four world leaders with goatees, three of whom"
18:20;18:28;"are African leaders. And one of them, who is the Sultan of Brunei, not sure if he's"
18:28;18:34;"still in power. But I think that a lot of these places will just lump all beards together."
18:34;18:36;"They're not going to make that distinction because it's too specific."
18:36;18:37;"- Interesting."
18:37;18:39;"- Great research, Seinfeld."
18:39;18:40;"- That was a very strong research."
18:40;18:41;"- Thank you."
18:41;18:42;"- On the fly."
18:42;18:47;"- There's a look of like a goatee that I associate with like, one of those like,"
18:47;18:51;"you know, early Soviet guys like Lenin or Trotsky. Did Lenin have a goatee?"
18:51;18:56;"- Yeah. And I feel like he's the kind of goatee that he's like waxing. He's like Williamsburg"
18:56;18:56;"style."
18:56;19:02;"- Although, you know, it's funny. When I search Lenin goatee, what comes up is Van Dyke beard."
19:02;19:06;"Van Dyke is a style of facial hair named after the 17th century Flemish painter"
19:07;19:09;"Anthony Van Dyke. You know him, Jake?"
19:09;19:14;"- I do. I do. But see, now I'm thinking if Lenin and Castro had beards."
19:14;19:16;"- Ah, it was a communist thing."
19:16;19:17;"- 1950s and 60s."
19:17;19:21;"- Or maybe it's solidarity with the proletariat or something."
19:21;19:25;"- Yeah, I can see that. In the capitalist countries, they were just like,"
19:25;19:27;"we shave our faces clean."
19:27;19:30;"- But you know who has a goatee? Uncle Sam."
19:30;19:31;"- Oh, right."
19:31;19:35;"- That's a tight call. That really throws a wrench in this."
19:35;19:40;"- Although he has a very specific type of goatee. His is kind of like,"
19:40;19:42;"the closest thing I can think of is the guy from Anthrax."
19:42;19:47;"That he has the long, weird thing hanging down, like weird dilly goat sh*t."
19:47;19:53;"- I mean, I used to see that with like patriotic World War II era posters or whatever."
19:53;19:56;"So maybe they were trying to recall a character from the 19th century."
19:56;19:57;"- Yes."
19:57;20:00;"- Uncle Sam was not meant to be a contemporary."
20:00;20:03;"- I'm Uncle Sam. That's who I am."
20:03;20:06;"- Summer time."
20:06;20:10;"- Actually, I wanted to do a deep dive on US blues at some point because..."
20:10;20:11;"- Oh, I would love to."
20:11;20:15;"- It didn't quite come up when we were talking about the best American bands."
20:15;20:18;"I feel like at some point I was saying something about that."
20:18;20:22;"I felt like the reason that big American bands..."
20:22;20:25;"There hasn't been a version of an American Radiohead or Pink Floyd is because"
20:25;20:31;"that degree of seriousness somehow is not accepted from a big American band."
20:31;20:36;"Because America is like a country of hucksters and charlatans in a way."
20:36;20:38;"Like we can't even take ourselves that seriously."
20:38;20:46;"And I was thinking about, even though it's definitely not like a top dead tune to me,"
20:46;20:48;"I do see the appeal of US blues."
20:48;20:52;"There's something funny because it's like this kind of ironically patriotic song."
20:52;20:55;"Wave that flag, wave it wide and high."
20:55;20:58;"And the whole thing you keep talking about Uncle Sam and P.T. Barnum."
20:58;21:01;"And I love that because it's like Uncle Sam and then you also throw in"
21:02;21:05;"P.T. Barnum and you're like, yeah, American hucksterism."
21:05;21:09;"You know, there's something about that, that kind of like Cheshire Cat smile"
21:09;21:14;"about the dead and America and not taking it all too seriously."
21:14;21:16;"And the kind of showbiz hucksterism."
21:16;21:20;"Anyway, we'll unpack that one day."
21:20;21:22;"- Yeah, that's a cool read. I hadn't thought about it."

21:48;21:50;"No, that's too harsh."
21:50;21:53;"But this is very strange for TC."
21:53;21:57;"Normally we get to the hot news a few months after it hits."
21:57;22:00;"But weirdly, we did a whole thing about the Chunky Dunkies,"
22:00;22:04;"the Ben and Jerry's Nike shoe, like weeks ago."
22:04;22:06;"And I guess it's 'cause they just came out."
22:06;22:09;"But it's like, I figured that the Chunky Dunkies were just kind of like"
22:09;22:14;"a funny, weird, arguably busted shoe that, you know,"
22:14;22:18;"a handful of like insane sneaker heads might care about."
22:18;22:21;"And maybe a few, you know, ice cream enthusiasts"
22:21;22:22;"or just crunchy people from Vermont."
22:22;22:24;"But then I kept just seeing it more and more."
22:24;22:27;"And it's like LeBron has it and Bad Bunny has it."
22:27;22:29;"It's actually just gotten bigger and bigger."
22:29;22:32;"And now that they're out, Ben and Jerry's was trending on Twitter the other day"
22:32;22:35;"because people were so pissed off that they couldn't get them."
22:35;22:39;"I know the Seinfeld, you tried to cop a pair and what?"
22:39;22:40;"You just came up totally empty?"
22:40;22:42;"Yeah, I took an L on the sneakers app."
22:42;22:44;"So this is a major shoe."
22:44;22:46;"And somehow, time crisis."
22:46;22:50;"I'm getting like sent stuff on Instagram."
22:50;22:51;"We're getting tagged on stuff."
22:51;22:56;"And like, for once, we were like, we actually identified a major news story."
22:56;23:01;"So anyway, we want to find out a little bit more about like what this is all about."
23:01;23:05;"So we're going to get on the phone with Brendan Dunn,"
23:05;23:09;"who's a writer who knows quite a bit about shoes"
23:09;23:14;"and actually wrote an article for Complex about the Chunky Dunkies."
23:14;23:16;"So maybe he can fill us in on like,"
23:16;23:18;"what the hell's going on with the Chunky Dunkies?"
23:19;23:22;"Now, let's go to the time crisis hotline."
23:22;23:27;"Is that Brendan?"
23:27;23:28;"This is Brendan. What's up, guys?"
23:28;23:31;"Oh, hey, what's up? Welcome to Time Crisis."
23:31;23:32;"How is everyone?"
23:32;23:33;"Good. Thanks for talking to us."
23:33;23:35;"Oh, absolutely."
23:35;23:38;"So we first heard about the Chunky Dunkies about a month ago."
23:38;23:41;"And we were more interested in the Ben and Jerry's angle."
23:41;23:46;"But it seems that this shoe has become like a real phenomenon or something."
23:46;23:50;"Can you kind of fill us in on what's happening with the Chunky Dunkies this week?"
23:50;23:53;"I would say it's the biggest shoe so far this year,"
23:53;23:57;"not in terms of like actual numbers produced or quantity or anything like that,"
23:57;24:00;"because this is obviously like a limited affair meant to build hype."
24:00;24:02;"But in terms of how much people are talking about it,"
24:02;24:04;"yeah, definitely the biggest shoe so far this year."
24:04;24:06;"They released this past weekend."
24:06;24:08;"Normally, you know, there's like a staggered release."
24:08;24:11;"So they first show up at the skate shops to get allotments."
24:11;24:13;"And then a few days later, they drop the Nike sneakers."
24:13;24:18;"That's kind of two waves of disappointment that people are hit with and trying to buy the shoes."
24:18;24:20;"And so when they first announced the Chunky Dunkies,"
24:20;24:22;"because we actually we almost talked about it second,"
24:22;24:26;"because they announced a bunch of new SB Dunks."
24:26;24:30;"And the first one we talked about was the Grateful Dead one, which..."
24:30;24:31;"How do you feel about that shoe?"
24:31;24:35;"We gave it a big thumbs down when we saw it."
24:35;24:37;"We just thought it was busted, uncool,"
24:37;24:43;"not a particularly creative use of like the Grateful Dead's vibe or iconography."
24:43;24:45;"But anyway, so we were talking about that and they were like,"
24:45;24:46;"""Oh, they're also doing this Chunky Dunkies."""
24:46;24:50;"So when these were all announced in like the sneaker community,"
24:50;24:54;"was there already some reason that the Chunky Dunkies were a bigger deal?"
24:54;24:58;"Or was it like the design got people excited and the hype grew?"
24:58;25:01;"Like, why did the Chunky Dunkies become such a bigger deal than the Grateful Dead ones?"
25:01;25:04;"Well, so one thing is the Grateful Dead shoe isn't out yet."
25:04;25:06;"So it's tough to say how big of a deal that's going to be."
25:06;25:11;"But I do anticipate the Chunky Dunky being the biggest one of these SB releases."
25:12;25:14;"You know, I think it has to do a lot with the design."
25:14;25:17;"I think it looks so cartoony and so eye-catching."
25:17;25:20;"I think, too, it has to do with the collaborative partner."
25:20;25:24;"Like Ben & Jerry's just feels like so much more a mainstream thing than Grateful Dead does."
25:24;25:27;"It doesn't require the same level of explanation"
25:27;25:29;"that some of the other SB Dunk collaborations do."
25:29;25:32;"Like if you see it on social media, which I'm sure you have a million times,"
25:32;25:35;"like you just have to stop and look at it, you know what I mean?"
25:35;25:38;"And what's your take as somebody who knows a lot about sneakers,"
25:38;25:39;"like when you first saw that?"
25:39;25:42;"Which one, the Grateful Dead or the Chunky Dunky?"
25:42;25:43;"Well, actually, I'm curious about both."
25:43;25:46;"I think the Grateful Dead is like a putrid looking shoe."
25:46;25:47;"Absolutely."
25:47;25:50;"You know, and I think that it does have some DNA in the Nike SB line."
25:50;25:55;"So it looks a bit like that Three Bears pack that they did maybe in like 2008"
25:55;25:56;"or something like that."
25:56;26:01;"Another set of like fuzzy shoes, not associated with any particular bear"
26:01;26:03;"other than those of storybook childhood."
26:03;26:06;"But that shoe, I don't enjoy."
26:06;26:09;"I think the Chunky Dunky is actually a decent shoe."
26:10;26:12;"My idea on it is that I would not wear it."
26:12;26:13;"I could not wear it."
26:13;26:15;"But I think in terms of execution, it looks quite good."
26:15;26:17;"And there's a lot of cool details in the project."
26:17;26:21;"Like I think a lot of times we have to give brands the time to"
26:21;26:25;"tell their story around the shoe and figure out why they exist"
26:25;26:27;"according to the brand, because that's very important to me."
26:27;26:30;"So another one of the shoes in the same set,"
26:30;26:33;"I guess it's not really the same set, but there was leaked online"
26:33;26:35;"at the same time as the 7-11 SB Dunk."
26:35;26:37;"Did you guys see the 7-11 show?"
26:37;26:38;"I did see that recently."
26:38;26:43;"So the 7-11 shoe was more of like a lightning rod for conversation."
26:43;26:45;"We actually ran a post on Complex.com,"
26:45;26:47;"one of my coworkers about how upset he was about the sneaker"
26:47;26:51;"because he felt this is not something like ESP should be doing on any level."
26:51;26:52;"This makes no sense."
26:52;26:55;"There's no legitimate connection to skateboarding or sneaker dumb in this."
26:55;27:01;"It turns out that 7-11 shoe was actually intended for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics."
27:01;27:04;"And so 7-11 is owned by a Japanese corporation."
27:04;27:07;"And there's like more 7-11s in Japan than anywhere else in the world."
27:07;27:09;"So it made a little bit more sense given that context."
27:09;27:12;"So I do think the context around them is important."
27:12;27:16;"And so I think that when I learned more about the Chunky Dunky,"
27:16;27:17;"it made more sense to me."
27:17;27:19;"I think there are some shared brand values."
27:19;27:21;"You know, I talked to a guy at Ben and Jerry's who was involved."
27:21;27:25;"And I think that both Nike and Ben and Jerry's kind of come from this"
27:25;27:28;"hippie style, like 1970s entrepreneurialism."
27:28;27:30;"They both have roots in college towns."
27:30;27:36;"They both like, I think there's something fun that Nike SB has to it that Nike proper,"
27:36;27:38;"like on the top level doesn't."
27:38;27:40;"And I think that Ben and Jerry's kind of shares that as well."
27:40;27:46;"So generally though, the 7-11 shoe created more divisive conversation"
27:46;27:50;"than the Chunky Dunky went down somewhat easily in the sneaker community."
27:50;27:51;"When that was first announced, people were like,"
27:51;27:54;"""Oh, that's fun. That's cool. Ben and Jerry's. Cool association."""
27:54;27:57;"Yeah, I think, I mean, I still think a lot of people were upset by the Ben and Jerry's."
27:57;28:00;"Like I definitely saw people calling it the ugliest shoe they've ever seen."
28:00;28:02;"And I'm not necessarily mad at that comment, you know."
28:02;28:04;"I do think the execution is good on it."
28:04;28:07;"I think there's a lot of cool details, but I think it's important."
28:07;28:10;"These things are wearable and I don't know how much the Chunky Dunky,"
28:10;28:13;"even just like saying the shoe's name, like as a 30 year old man,"
28:13;28:17;"saying that, you know, the word Chunky Dunky is like insane."
28:17;28:18;"It's fun, but insane."
28:18;28:22;"Yeah, it's funny too that you draw that connection between Nike and Ben and Jerry's because"
28:22;28:29;"before like the Jordans era, obviously I'm thinking about that because of the last dance and,"
28:29;28:33;"you know, the way that Nike and Jordan teamed up with each other,"
28:33;28:36;"these key moments in their career to become this global brand."
28:36;28:38;"But before that, Nike was like crunchy."
28:38;28:42;"You know, you picture like Prefontaine, kind of like a crunchy dude."
28:42;28:44;"University of Oregon. I mean, they're the ducks."
28:44;28:44;"Go ducks, baby."
28:44;28:45;"It's like crunchy."
28:45;28:49;"Oregon is a crunchy state. It's a top five crunchy state."
28:49;28:54;"And also I've noticed this thing, maybe just in some of like the stuff that I follow online,"
28:54;28:56;"which maybe leans a little more crunchy,"
28:56;29:01;"but there's been a revival of interest in that old Nike guy who's like the hiker."
29:01;29:02;"Do you know what I'm talking about?"
29:02;29:04;"The hike Nike guy."
29:04;29:04;"Yeah."
29:04;29:08;"So you see that guy, actually, somebody did a good Vampire Weekend bootleg of that,"
29:08;29:11;"which I love, but you see that guy and you're kind of like,"
29:11;29:14;"what is this funny bygone era of Nike?"
29:14;29:19;"Just kind of like kind vibe, track and field, Oregon crunch."
29:19;29:22;"Like, yeah, Nike went on to do something amazing and bigger."
29:22;29:26;"But yeah, when you scratch the surface, that connection makes a lot of sense."
29:26;29:30;"Like Vermont, Oregon, crunchy, homemade."
29:30;29:32;"You know, like, I don't know if you've been to Burlington."
29:32;29:34;"I'm kind of biased here, too, because like I'm from Oregon."
29:34;29:37;"I went to University of Oregon and then like my brother lives in Burlington,"
29:37;29:39;"which is where Ben and Jerry's is headquartered."
29:39;29:43;"But I do think there's a lot of kinship between Burlington and Portland kind of being"
29:43;29:45;"coastal adjacent hippie type cities."
29:45;29:49;"And like you said, Eugene and Burlington, both college towns."
29:49;29:52;"So I do think there's something legitimate there and just shared values or shared origins."
29:52;29:53;"Yeah, absolutely."
29:53;29:56;"So yeah, in some ways, the Chunky Dunky is like"
29:56;29:59;"a return to something that's always been there."
30:00;30:02;"The crunchy donkey, the crunchy donkey."
30:02;30:03;"That should be the next one."
30:03;30:07;"Another question kind of off that is you talked about that they release"
30:07;30:13;"or at least they announced these SB Dunk collabs around the same time,"
30:13;30:16;"almost like it's a collection or a pod."
30:16;30:20;"Obviously, 7-Eleven doesn't really fit, but we kind of wondered when we first heard about it."
30:20;30:23;"We're like, wait, they're announcing a Grateful Dead and a Ben and Jerry's thing here."
30:23;30:27;"Is this like SB Dunk's crunchy year?"
30:27;30:28;"Is that a coincidence?"
30:28;30:29;"You know what I mean?"
30:29;30:33;"Like to clarify, the Nikes only announced the Ben and Jerry's one,"
30:33;30:35;"the one that released the Chunky Dunky, the Grateful Dead."
30:35;30:37;"They still haven't said anything about they would never"
30:37;30:40;"officially acknowledge as of yet that the shoe exists."
30:40;30:41;"Oh, what are these pictures we've seen?"
30:41;30:42;"These are like leaks."
30:42;30:44;"These are people at factories leaking them or people"
30:44;30:48;"getting early pairs through shady means and things like that."
30:48;30:51;"So even the 7-Eleven shoe, we confirmed that it was"
30:51;30:54;"canceled before Nike ever confirmed that it existed."
30:54;30:54;"You know what I mean?"
30:54;30:55;"I see."
30:55;31:00;"I only say that to say that Nike wasn't necessarily positioning these three shoes as"
31:00;31:03;"a cohesive idea or a cohesive collection."
31:03;31:05;"But I do think there's a lot of overlap between the"
31:05;31:08;"Ben and Jerry's one and the Grateful Dead one."
31:08;31:11;"Have there ever been rumors of a Phish SB Dunk?"
31:11;31:13;"No, not as of yet."
31:13;31:16;"But actually, Nike or Ben and Jerry's, I'm not sure who,"
31:16;31:20;"but made sure that the guitarist from Phish got an early pair of Chunky Dunky."
31:20;31:22;"So if you go on his Instagram."
31:22;31:23;"Yeah, what's the guy's name?"
31:23;31:24;"Phil?"
31:24;31:25;"It was the bassist, Mike Gordon."
31:25;31:26;"Mike, close to him."
31:26;31:29;"I'm picturing the Nike PR person who was like,"
31:29;31:31;"""Who are we sending out the Chunky Dunkys to?"""
31:31;31:36;"And it was like, ""All right, my top three, Bad Bunny, LeBron James, Mike from Phish."""
31:36;31:39;"That kind of covers the Chunky Dunky coalition."
31:39;31:40;"That's everything you need."
31:40;31:44;"So this is kind of basic, but we don't know that much about this stuff."
31:44;31:50;"So the SB Dunk is a skateboarding shoe that Nike launched 20-ish years ago."
31:50;31:56;"Is it known to be one of the Nike shoes that's built for collaborations?"
31:56;31:58;"Yeah, it's definitely a canvas for that."
31:58;32:02;"And it has been since its inception around 2002."
32:02;32:06;"It's interesting because Nike has a policy now where they're more focused on"
32:06;32:08;"actually collaborating with entities."
32:08;32:11;"Some of those projects from Nike SB's heyday were"
32:11;32:16;"things where they would wink and nod and make cultural references to outside partners"
32:16;32:18;"or to outside entities without actually teaming up with them."
32:18;32:22;"So there's the Heineken Dunk that never released, allegedly, because of legal reasons,"
32:22;32:26;"where they have a very obvious Heineken color scheme to it."
32:26;32:30;"What are some of the other classics from the past 20 years, official or unofficial?"
32:30;32:33;"Yeah, so the MF Doom Dunk from 2007 is a big one."
32:33;32:36;"A lot of people consider the high watermarks for Nike SB Dunks."
32:36;32:39;"The Pigeon. Do you know about the Pigeon Dunks from 2005?"
32:39;32:40;"Jeff Staples' shoe."
32:40;32:42;"It's gray. It literally looks like a pigeon."
32:42;32:43;"Yeah, and it has a pigeon on it."
32:43;32:47;"And there was a miniature Riot on Orchard Street when they released in New York."
32:47;32:48;"That was a big one."
32:48;32:51;"The Tiffany Dunk from 2005 from Diamond Supply Co."
32:51;32:53;"That's in the kind of Tiffany color way."
32:53;32:57;"Nike SB is interesting too, because it's enjoying a bit of a resurgence right now,"
32:57;33:02;"but it's heyday, most people would say, is really 2002 to 2008 or so."
33:02;33:05;"But there's been kind of a resurgence around Nike SB"
33:05;33:08;"that's dovetailed with the resurgence around the dunk in general,"
33:08;33:10;"the non-SB versions of the dunk."
33:10;33:12;"Like Virgil Abloh did some dunks last year,"
33:12;33:14;"and Nike's reissuing a bunch of dunks this year."
33:14;33:16;"So those two things have kind of combined"
33:16;33:21;"and helped things like the Chunky Dunky out in terms of this crazy resale price."
33:21;33:23;"Yeah, well, how much are they going for right now?"
33:23;33:26;"You know what? It's looking like around $1,700, which is insane."
33:26;33:29;"When coronavirus and lockdown first started happening,"
33:29;33:33;"a lot of people were predicting that the sneaker resale market was going to slow down or"
33:33;33:38;"collapse or something, but there's no indication of that because this is a huge release."
33:38;33:41;"There's also a promo. Have you seen the promo version of the shoe?"
33:41;33:43;"Is that the one that comes in an ice cream container?"
33:43;33:47;"Yeah, it comes in a giant pint. So people are trying to sell those for like $3,700."
33:47;33:49;"My God."
33:49;33:50;"Yeah, it's absurd."
33:50;33:53;"And so you said though, we're only in the first wave, so"
33:53;33:57;"eventually this shoe will be easier to get and the price will drop?"
33:57;34:00;"No, no, no. Both waves have already happened. So the first wave was..."
34:00;34:01;"So it's done?"
34:01;34:02;"It's done."
34:02;34:04;"Ah, okay. So when we were talking about like,"
34:04;34:09;"Seinfeld was just talking about going on the sneakers app and not getting them,"
34:09;34:13;"people were not just disappointed because they're like, ""Oh, damn, I wanted to get them soon."""
34:13;34:14;"It's over."
34:14;34:17;"Unless you want to pay $1,700 for them."
34:17;34:17;"Whoa."
34:17;34:20;"Do you know how many pairs were made?"
34:20;34:22;"Nike never really releases those numbers and they're very"
34:22;34:26;"focused on making sure that their partners don't talk about those numbers either."
34:26;34:31;"I would guess around 20,000, but that's a guess."
34:31;34:34;"That's odd because usually if you're doing like a limited edition"
34:34;34:39;"market thing, you sort of like will tell people what the edition number is."
34:39;34:41;"You know, like a fine art screen print or something."
34:41;34:42;"Right."
34:42;34:44;"This is an edition of 30."
34:44;34:46;"Yeah. There's a handful of Nike projects that will number it out like that."
34:46;34:52;"There was actually a 420 SB dunk earlier this year that was, you know, X out of 420 pairs,"
34:52;34:56;"but it's pretty rare that they will be public with the information about how many are made."
34:56;34:58;"Whoa. But your guess is 20,000."
34:58;34:59;"Yeah."
34:59;35:01;"Very interesting. Do you have a pair?"
35:01;35:02;"No, absolutely not."
35:02;35:04;"Because you don't want them?"
35:04;35:08;"You know what? I do want them, but honestly, I would probably end up reselling them."
35:08;35:13;"Is it also like what's that phrase that the cobbler's children have no shoes?"
35:13;35:17;"I don't remember exactly what it means, but as somebody who knows so much about sneakers"
35:17;35:22;"and covers it professionally and you know, like all the details, has that like curbed"
35:22;35:24;"your impulse to own them yourself?"
35:24;35:25;"No, not on this one."
35:25;35:26;"You're still a collector."
35:26;35:30;"Yeah. And I just want to like, I feel like this shoe particularly is one that has to be"
35:30;35:33;"held in your hands or really be appreciated because like I said,"
35:33;35:34;"there's all these cool details to it."
35:34;35:39;"So even more than owning it, you know, I just want to hold it."
35:39;35:42;"So if you did get a pair, you would hold it and then like put it"
35:42;35:47;"kind of just like almost like an art object, like never wear it."
35:47;35:51;"I mean, I would hold it and then like take a photo of me licking a soul for Instagram"
35:51;35:54;"and then probably list them on StockX for $1,700."
35:54;35:57;"Yeah, that makes sense."
35:57;35:59;"Well, thanks so much, man."
35:59;36:02;"I hope you'll call in again when we're covering shoes, because this is,"
36:02;36:06;"I think one of our most informative phone calls of all time, actually."
36:06;36:09;"Yeah, anytime you want to talk sneakers with them, I'm happy to help."
36:09;36:15;"And just for the listeners, you write a lot for Complex, but you also have your own website."
36:15;36:20;"So I'm the GM of Complex Sneakers, and then I'm also running the sneaker coverage at"
36:20;36:24;"Soul Collector and I do a talk show called Full Size Run that's sneaker focused."
36:24;36:26;"And then we also have the Complex Sneakers podcast."
36:26;36:28;"So it's my whole life for better or worse."
36:28;36:30;"Amazing. We'll definitely check it out."
36:30;36:31;"All right. Well, thanks, dude."
36:31;36:32;"Have a good one."
36:32;36:40;"Thank you, gentlemen."
36:40;36:49;"Thank you."
36:49;37:17;"I had a small inkling earlier when we first started talking about the chunky"
37:17;37:20;"donkeys. I was like, should I try to get some?"
37:20;37:25;"I mean, I know a couple people at Nike. I've hit them up in the past for certain shoes."
37:25;37:33;"I actually hit up my guy at Nike more recently, not for the chunky donkeys, but for these ACG"
37:33;37:38;"sandals, the Dayshuts sandals. Are you guys familiar with these?"
37:38;37:41;"Did you say that you hit up your guy at Nike?"
37:41;37:44;"Yeah. Not for the chunky donkeys, because I just didn't care enough."
37:44;37:46;"No, but you have a guy at Nike."
37:46;37:49;"Yeah. All musicians have a guy at Nike."
37:49;37:51;"Talk about that. Who's your guy?"
37:51;37:54;"Well, I don't want to like, I don't know how private he is or something."
37:54;37:57;"But basically, I mean, I don't even name. I just like, what's the relationship?"
37:57;37:58;"What's the backstory?"
37:58;38:05;"Well, I think the first time I met a guy at Nike was probably like 10 years ago at some kind of"
38:05;38:09;"like festival or something where, you know, there's brands all the time setting up stuff."
38:09;38:14;"And I've always liked Nike. I mean, obviously, there's problematic elements in the history of"
38:14;38:18;"the company and stuff, but like, you know, I like the origin story of the company."
38:18;38:24;"And just for whatever reason, you know, it's like, that was my go to. I don't know why, you know."
38:24;38:29;"So there's the guy from Nike giving out shoes and like talking with artists and stuff. And I"
38:29;38:31;"remember talking to him, I was like, oh, what's your, so you work for Nike? And he's like,"
38:31;38:34;"I do artist relations specifically for music."
38:34;38:38;"A lot of these companies have somebody like that. And they're like, yeah, there's somebody"
38:38;38:43;"else does like actors and of course, athletes. That's a giant department. You know, a lot of"
38:43;38:47;"these companies might have one or two guys who like do music stuff. And they were giving out,"
38:47;38:51;"you know, they had a few pairs of shoes you could choose. And I think I got a pair of Air Max"
38:51;38:57;"90s or maybe 92s. And it was cool. I remember like having an interesting conversation."
38:57;39:00;"So that guy worked there for a while. And you know, like every once in a while,"
39:00;39:05;"they would like send a new pair of shoes that they're like, oh, I thought you might like these."
39:05;39:09;"And then every once in a while, which is pretty rare for me, like every couple of years,"
39:09;39:13;"I might see a pair of shoes and not be able to find them and say, oh, could you help me get these?"
39:13;39:17;"And sometimes and they'd be like, yeah, let me let me sit. So it's pretty mellow. And it's been"
39:17;39:22;"different people over the years. But once in a blue moon, I hear that something new is coming."
39:22;39:26;"And it looks like it's going to be like a real hassle to find such as this reissued"
39:26;39:32;"ACG air day shirts. I'm sure I'm saying it wrong. Well, Jake, are you familiar with"
39:32;39:37;"the ACG line of Nike? No, I'm sort of like Crosby over here,"
39:37;39:43;"man. I'm not a fashion or apparel guy like Crosby. You had your time in your early 20s"
39:43;39:48;"where you were peacocking for the ladies. You're trying out. Right. What was my look"
39:48;39:55;"back in my early 20s? It was maybe a Papa John's windbreaker. And what was the most fashion"
39:55;40:01;"moment of your life? That's such a funny question, because I know there's no way that you're going"
40:01;40:07;"to be like, actually, the fall winter 98 product collection. It's random, man. I threw up a copy"
40:07;40:14;"of Vogue at the doctor's office. And I was like really into that. And yeah, I saved up and I"
40:14;40:19;"bought this one sweater for nine hundred fifty dollars. I know that's not going to be the answer."
40:19;40:24;"But maybe there's like a moment where I could picture you being like, you know what, I want"
40:24;40:30;"to go a little more in this direction where you actually were like, I want a new pair of shoes"
40:30;40:34;"and I want them to be, you know. Yeah, I know you're asking. I don't."
40:34;40:39;"Nothing is springing to mind. Yeah, it's funny. I'm really drawing a blank here. I'm like,"
40:39;40:44;"have you ever coveted a clothing item, an apparel item?"
40:44;40:51;"I think no. Like the only thing that I could conceivably see getting into would be like"
40:51;40:57;"cool, like old, like band T-shirts. But that just seems lame, like buying, spending a lot of money"
40:58;41:06;"on like an old concert T-shirt and like, you know, what if I just use very contrived."
41:06;41:11;"Oh, wait, what do we got here? We got friend of the show, Jonah Hill in the building."
41:11;41:18;"Welcome back to Time Crisis. What's up, buddy? Hey, what's up? We were just it's actually very"
41:18;41:25;"Ezra's got the quarantine haircut. I haven't seen you in a minute. That's true."
41:26;41:31;"The last time we actually FaceTimed was maybe like a few weeks ago. Yeah, my hair is good,"
41:31;41:37;"but I kind of Rashida was asking me if I wanted her to try to cut the back just to shape it up."
41:37;41:42;"But as I see this little mullet starting to peek out, I'm like, oh, maybe I've been needing that."
41:42;41:45;"Yeah, I kind of wanted to grow out, but I don't want it to look too messy."
41:45;41:48;"You're in what my nephew calls like the awkward stage."
41:48;41:52;"Yes. I don't think you look awkward. I think you look good, but you're in like a middle length."
41:52;41:58;"No, I like you're in the decision. It's called the decision because you got to either decide to go"
41:58;42:02;"long or go back to your normal. Well, that's what's good about quarantine is that you can just"
42:02;42:08;"kind of ride out the decision phase and not really think about it because it's like there's just very"
42:08;42:14;"little pressure. But I think I would I'm curious how it would feel to have longish hair now. So"
42:14;42:19;"maybe I just got to ride it out. My decision is to go there. I'm stoked. I think you should do it."
42:19;42:25;"Jake, how are you? I'm doing well. Thank you. How are you? I'm well. I'm well. I requested"
42:25;42:29;"Ezra to talk to you guys because I have so much fun when I do that. I needed some fun."
42:29;42:32;"We're very happy to have you back. Oh, yeah. Before you call, we were talking with"
42:32;42:39;"a writer for Complex, among other things. Brendan Dunn, he was giving us his take on the new Nike"
42:39;42:42;"chunky donkey. Obviously, you're more of a tri striper."
42:42;42:47;"I work with Adidas and that is the only shoe that matters."
42:47;42:52;"Because that really started to become like time crisis fashion talk. I was asking Jake if he ever"
42:52;42:58;"coveted an item of clothes. And the answer is no. His whole life, which obviously I don't think you"
42:58;43:05;"or me can relate to that. I respect it. No, I respect it, too. I was actually because I was"
43:05;43:09;"just thinking, like, Jake, if I hit you up one day and I was just like, dude, there's like a super"
43:09;43:18;"rare early 90s guided by voices shirt at a vintage store in Tokyo. It's 275. It's about to go."
43:18;43:25;"If you want me to say 75, it's 675 dollars. If I pull the trigger right now, will you pay me back"
43:25;43:31;"and I'll get it for you? Would there be any flicker of and it was like sick. It was like an early"
43:31;43:36;"guide about voices. I would be more touched by the gesture of you reaching out to me if I wanted"
43:36;43:41;"to get the shirt than I would be have have any interest in the shirt itself. That's called a"
43:41;43:45;"good person right there, dude. And also it is kind of your head's in the right place, bro."
43:45;43:49;"If I was being a good friend, I would just get it for you because that'd be like a gift for you"
43:49;43:54;"versus just like, dude, I'm talking to the guy right now. If you Venmo me, I will."
43:54;44:00;"I will purchase this for you. Yeah, because then I'm in a situation where I feel"
44:00;44:04;"almost obligated to get the shirt. You've stumbled across this discovery."
44:04;44:09;"Let me ask you, as it would, Jake, does the Venmo have to go through first before you buy it?"
44:09;44:16;"If you promise it's going to Venmo you. So you have to see the transaction is complete before"
44:16;44:21;"you go with the credit card, right? Shop. It's like 3 a.m. in L.A. I'm in Tokyo during the day"
44:21;44:26;"and I'm just like, dude, dude, like Jake wakes up to 10 text. And I was like, bro, the Venmo didn't"
44:26;44:33;"go through. I had to let it go. Some kid bought it. Dude, there's a kid right behind me in line"
44:33;44:39;"and he was just like, I'll take it. But because this episode is turning into sneaker talk a little"
44:39;44:44;"bit, tell us a little bit about it. I have a sneaker, dude. I have a sneaker coming out July 11th."
44:44;44:48;"Well, yeah, I wanted to ask you that because because you announced your Adidas collection."
44:48;44:53;"But yeah, anybody seen anything from it yet? I can show them to you and you can react"
44:53;44:59;"without giving away details. There's leaked photos online. So my first shoe that comes out is a"
44:59;45:06;"superstar that I designed that comes out July 11th. And yeah, I just work with them and they're"
45:06;45:11;"amazing. And they let me like, you know, I'm kind of like their in-house director. I'll direct. I"
45:11;45:17;"directed like the superstar campaign and then they let me design shoes and clothes. So the first drop,"
45:17;45:23;"like the first thing is the J.H. Superstar. Oh, sick. Tight. I like it. It's very simple. It's"
45:23;45:28;"kind of the opposite of the Chunky Dunky in some ways. It's a little more elegant. Yeah. I tried"
45:28;45:33;"to go for like you can wear it with nice clothes. It's essentially like you could wear it like if"
45:33;45:39;"you have a job. You can. It seems wearable. Yeah. So I'm pretty high. And what's the like,"
45:39;45:44;"you know, you guys will be getting pairs first. Yeah, because, you know, it was like this really"
45:44;45:50;"big deal when Beyonce did her Adidas line. I mean, that was a big thing on social media. It's"
45:50;45:56;"like who's getting a package, who's getting the really special, like fancy thousand pound trunk"
45:56;46:00;"wheeled out to people's house, the full wardrobe and stuff. So that's kind of like a big deal is"
46:00;46:05;"like we were also talking about with the Chunky Dunky. They were like LeBron's getting one. Make"
46:05;46:10;"sure one of the guys from Phish gets one. It's very interesting. Like, you know, it's a big deal."
46:10;46:16;"Well, it's funny because my original version of it. Well, COVID obviously changed everything"
46:16;46:21;"because it was supposed to come out earlier. But I wanted to do just the only people I sent up to"
46:21;46:29;"were like David Geffen, Clarence Avon, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos. Just the old school showbiz dudes."
46:29;46:37;"Yeah, Quincy, like hook up like five old legendary just goat music executives."
46:37;46:40;"I mean, you definitely should send them to Quincy because he's a big shoes guy."
46:40;46:45;"Oh, for sure. He did it. You guys are all on the scene. He did a collab with Buscemi."
46:45;46:53;"You know, I was right. Yeah. What? There's not Steve Buscemi. Okay. There's like a very high"
46:53;46:59;"end. I was so confused. The Quincy Jones, Steve Buscemi, Ben and Jerry's. Yeah, you know,"
46:59;47:02;"I call him because he said he said I call it with a quickie. You know,"
47:02;47:07;"I like the music. I like the thriller, thriller, like thriller. And so I"
47:13;47:17;"there's a high end sneaker brand called Buscemi. And Quincy did. I don't know if it was his shoe,"
47:17;47:22;"or he just did that campaign. No, that guy did sick ad campaigns. He did like Quincy,"
47:22;47:28;"like Larry Flynt, like just la legit kind of like older, iconic entertainment la figures."
47:28;47:33;"I think that's such a cool move when brands like rather than getting like the same three,"
47:33;47:41;"like super young models over and over again. Like when famously Celine did the ad with Joan Didion."
47:41;47:45;"Where? Yeah, it's amazing. Cool. And they get like older people and ads, whether and there's"
47:45;47:49;"also examples where it's not necessarily famous people. That's what I'm trying to do is get like"
47:49;47:54;"just people that we always joke around who are like the goats, like the OGs. You know,"
47:54;47:59;"you got to give a fair to like Larry King. Oh, dude, no, I want like Tom Cruise."
47:59;48:06;"I want like, yeah, Elon Musk's baby and like Jeff Bezos. Yeah, the baby shoes is very important to"
48:07;48:11;"one question I have is like, this is kind of ignorant question, but what's the backstory on"
48:11;48:17;"the superstar that so that's, you chose to do your version of an Adidas superstar because you"
48:17;48:22;"there's a whole history to the superstar as a shoe, right? It's the big anniversary of the"
48:22;48:29;"superstar, the 50th, I think anniversary of the superstar. So that's why that's the first one."
48:29;48:36;"I have another shoe coming out later that is more like specific to what I have worn my whole life."
48:36;48:40;"Just growing up. Yeah, obviously, you don't have to tell us all like the no spoilers, but"
48:40;48:45;"just growing up your tries. I don't know why I always sometimes I drop that on people when I'm"
48:45;48:48;"just like, oh, you're try striper. What the are you talking about? I don't know if I heard that"
48:48;48:52;"in the song, but I always just refer to people who like our Adidas heads is try stripers. I think"
48:52;48:58;"people say three stripes. Oh, three stripes. Like I'm a Kanye song is like if I see you pull up with"
48:58;49:03;"the three stripes. That's what I've never heard. Roots. Oh, yeah. Maybe it's a Jersey thing. Yeah,"
49:03;49:09;"I'm thinking tri state try striper. But the first Adidas shoe I ever knew about was the soccer shoes"
49:09;49:13;"sambas because me and Jonah, if people don't know, we're basically the exact same age. It's partially"
49:13;49:20;"why when we first met early days, we were like 22, 23, which is like instantly same generation."
49:20;49:24;"So old. Yeah, we're now we're pretty old. But in New Jersey, at my middle school,"
49:24;49:29;"there was a year when everybody wore air walks, all the cool kids that air walks. And then there"
49:29;49:34;"was a year where it was ridiculous. Everybody had the black sambas in your middle school growing up"
49:34;49:41;"in LA. That was like on trend for in those years of your life to kind of it wasn't as big out here"
49:41;49:46;"as it was on the east coast because I know about that. You know, summer camp samba kind of life,"
49:46;49:53;"right? Like that wet hot American summer kind of samba Jewish. Yeah. But I feel like that's"
49:53;49:59;"east coast. I feel like that ride. Yeah, ours was like I always wore sambas. I those my that's my"
49:59;50:05;"favorite shoe. But a lot of kids wore Pumas air walks like there's like kind of waves that go"
50:05;50:10;"through like sort of like a virus. You know, they kind of sweep through like kids like there's just"
50:10;50:16;"phases like at my school like one for like six months everyone was in the stickers, like collecting"
50:16;50:22;"stickers. That didn't really that's my weird ass school for sure. Like I do. I it's funny because"
50:22;50:27;"I still see it's stickers in a weird way with LA because at famously at that farmers market,"
50:27;50:33;"there's the sticker store. Yes, that's where you get to all right, you want that West Coast stickers."
50:33;50:37;"And that new stand at the farmers market is where you get pogs when that was the way"
50:37;50:44;"and my homie a lot we had pogs. My homie Alon's dad shout out to the Sobels. That's their magazine"
50:44;50:50;"stand. That's what they Oh, really? Yeah. Magazine stand culture is a very special LA thing that"
50:50;50:55;"needs to be preserved. Yeah, it's amazing. We had a shot of it in mid 90s that got cut that I was"
50:55;51:00;"bummed about where he like skates up to the thing and reads the magazines. Although curb did one"
51:00;51:06;"the one they use this year is my home magazine stand near my parent like where I grew up."
51:06;51:10;"Because it's on Pico, Mike Prosser. Pretty cool, huh?"
51:10;51:18;"Yeah, he's got to get over here. The new stands of LA."
51:18;51:26;"Now to step haven't even lost a step. Still the same entertaining guy. You know,"
51:26;51:32;"stories for days, you know, so what are the other classic Adidas shoes like"
51:32;51:38;"Stan Smith's Stan Smith's or fire gazelles or fire the cope was an indoor soccer shoe,"
51:38;51:43;"which is being sick. You should look it up. It's that sounds familiar. Well, and also just"
51:43;51:47;"generally, obviously, I know you got this connection to Adidas. I'm just curious because"
51:47;51:51;"we were just talking about Nike's now we're talking about Adidas. I do like both but my"
51:51;51:56;"heart lies a little bit more with Nike's for whatever reason. Yeah, because you're generally"
51:56;52:01;"speaking Yeah, yeah, because I'm a sucker. Yeah, because you're a punk for sure. So I like the"
52:01;52:07;"Nike ACG collection because that's kind of gorp core crunchy. Adidas never got crunchy. I got a"
52:07;52:14;"more European refined kind of Europe. Right? I'm more of like a European soccer kind of guy"
52:15;52:21;"than a garpy outdoor guy. It's so funny because it's like I realized I dress like a British soccer"
52:21;52:26;"who again, like that's just how I dress, especially quarantine. Like quarantine. It literally looks"
52:26;52:31;"like I'm in like train spotting like outside of a soccer arena. You know what I'm saying? I love"
52:31;52:37;"that. And you're one of the first people that made me aware of that brand palace, which is a skating"
52:37;52:42;"brand, but it's British, right? Yeah, so those are my friends. And I've done a lot of stuff with them"
52:42;52:47;"and they kind of use that aesthetic within skateboarding. That's kind of their whole thing,"
52:47;52:54;"like rave culture and like chav kind of like soccer hooligan rave culture. pirate radio. And"
52:54;52:59;"they work with Adidas a lot too. And that's like it's all family. Shout out to Lev Stewart."
52:59;53:04;"My general question then is like, and maybe also because I'm still thinking about the last dance"
53:04;53:10;"and revisiting the 90s. The 90s was like kind of a Nike decade, at least in the US,"
53:10;53:16;"like whatever you thought was cooler. With Jordan being so ascendant. Nike just pulled hardcore into"
53:16;53:23;"first in the 90s. And now it's this kind of back and forth with a lot of people saying like,"
53:23;53:29;"no, no Adidas is back on top. Is that like roughly what happened? Uh, I don't know. I think it's kind"
53:29;53:37;"of like, I think fashion swayed toward Adidas a lot this decade, or recently, right? Like, I think it"
53:37;53:42;"became more fashionable. But I always rode with the three stripes. I think it's like, it's like,"
53:42;53:47;"it just kind of got more, it got cooler to wear those old models that have been around forever."
53:47;53:54;"Right, right. Like, I think it's like more classic. It's not like doesn't look all new"
53:54;53:59;"and crazy. You know, like sometimes other shoe companies for me, like they swing too hard and"
53:59;54:05;"like crazy. And then you buy them and then you're like futuristic. Yeah, I like this classic like"
54:05;54:10;"that just the ones that like the Beastie Boys were and like cool athlete like Pele. And then"
54:10;54:16;"it's like, you could see it in the picture 20 years from now. And you're not going to cringe."
54:16;54:20;"You're just going to be like, that's a classic shoe. You're not going to be like,"
54:20;54:22;"I took a weird swing on that one."
54:23;54:24;"Yeah, I can see that."
54:37;54:43;"I did speak. I wore my sneakers but I'm not a thief. My Adidas hurts the sand of a foreign land."
54:43;54:49;"With my in hand, I come to command. My Adidas in me, close ass can be. We make a mean team."
54:49;54:54;"My Adidas and me, we get around together. We drive forever and you won't be mad."
54:54;54:56;"We're more than bad, better than my peers."
54:56;55:02;"All right, let's change the subject. This past week, there was a hashtag trending that kind of"
55:02;55:09;"combined two of our favorite subjects, music and fast food. The trending hashtag was Burger King is"
55:09;55:14;"over party. I imagine you guys are familiar with this concept called cancel culture."
55:14;55:20;"And the official phrase goes like is over party, right? That's right. Exactly. The blank is over"
55:20;55:24;"party. Yeah. And sometimes it's a joke. Sometimes it's serious. Sometimes you can't even tell,"
55:24;55:30;"but something will set off a fan community or a group of people. And next thing you know,"
55:30;55:35;"you got somebody's over party. And do you guys know why Burger King was getting canceled?"
55:35;55:40;"No. What did they get canceled for? Okay. So basically, you know, like all,"
55:40;55:44;"especially burger companies, I don't know why burger companies need to be the most active"
55:44;55:50;"brands. Somebody named Audrey, who I think it looks like based on her avatar is probably a big"
55:50;55:56;"Taylor Swift fan. She tweeted at Burger King. I need to know what's y'all's favorite Taylor Swift"
55:56;56:03;"song. So Burger King wrote back to Audrey, the one about her ex. Damn. At first I had to like,"
56:03;56:07;"think about it. Cause I was like, wait, what do they mean? And then I realized, okay,"
56:07;56:15;"Burger King is making a joke. Taylor Swift has often come under fire by the media by saying all"
56:15;56:20;"she does is kiss and tell. She only writes about her exes. Many of whom happen to be famous."
56:20;56:25;"And Taylor Swift herself, and of course her fans as well as often stood up to them and said,"
56:25;56:30;"this is a double standard. Most songwriters write about their personal lives and their experiences."
56:30;56:34;"She's absolutely right. And she's right. And she's, I'm not uniquely"
56:34;56:38;"somebody who kisses and tells and what about, and you know, she gives an example of a million male"
56:38;56:43;"musicians. And, and sometimes I think she even felt like that song wasn't even about that person."
56:43;56:49;"You guys are now perpetuating the snare. So Burger King thought they were being maybe kind of funny,"
56:49;56:54;"but they actually had a very sore spot for Taylor Swift and her fan community making this joke."
56:54;56:58;"Cause their joke essentially is that all of her songs are about her ex. It's like,"
56:58;57:02;"Oh, the one about her ex, whichever one of those 300 ones there are. So the Swifties,"
57:02;57:06;"those are Taylor Swift fans. They took great offense to this and they caused the hashtag"
57:06;57:11;"to trend. And I think they very quickly Burger King deleted the tweet. I don't think you would"
57:11;57:17;"have seen that kind of sloppiness in the, uh, uh, hey, Dave, the Wendy's account. Also,"
57:17;57:22;"I got to say, even if Burger King was trying to be kind of edgy here, what a weird swing."
57:22;57:28;"It's dated too. It's not even like a on trend Taylor Swift joke to make, you know what I mean?"
57:28;57:33;"Nobody's going to find that funny. I thought it was funny, Jake. I thought it was funny."
57:33;57:38;"Damn. What do you mean, man? I mean, most of her songs are about her ex, right? I mean,"
57:38;57:45;"here's the lesson. Don't say anything about anyone ever because the upside is not that great. And the"
57:45;57:51;"downside is actually, I'm thinking about Burger King. I mean, I'm imagining what Burger King"
57:51;57:55;"tastes like right now. So maybe it's a good thing. The truth is we very rarely talk about Burger"
57:55;58:00;"King on this show. We've talked at length about Wendy's probably our top burger place would be"
58:00;58:05;"Wendy's and McDonald's Burger King at distant third. Real talk. Carl's Jr. Is my favorite."
58:05;58:11;"I thought, okay. But I just thought actually that you and the people, a lot of people grew up in LA"
58:11;58:17;"because there's this thing that people not from LA come to LA. And then we go, uh, tell our friends"
58:17;58:21;"on the East coast. Oh, we've got in and out burger here. It's incredible. And then that burger is"
58:21;58:26;"very good. No, that's not, that's not in the same realm. I'm talking about fast food. I don't put"
58:26;58:32;"that in the conversation. Oh, okay. But the one I was going to think of that I know you ride for"
58:32;58:37;"is which to me is very LA is fat burger. Where does fat burger fall? I don't put that in the"
58:37;58:42;"conversation either. Fat burger in and out or like a tier above, not even above. They're just like"
58:42;58:49;"their regional chains as opposed to national, right? Yes. And in and out in a class by itself"
58:49;58:55;"and fat burgers doesn't do drive through. It's like a sit down order burger restaurant."
58:55;58:59;"Essentially. Pretty sure the fat burger on Vermont does drive through. Okay. Well,"
58:59;59:02;"you don't have to disrespect me like that. Like when we're talking about fat burger,"
59:02;59:06;"man, who's the real LA OG here? I don't know. I had to set the record straight. Thank you. Thank"
59:06;59:11;"you. Okay. But you're saying I put fat burger in and out is not the same as burger. Like you can't"
59:11;59:17;"put that in the same category. In my opinion, I'm talking about King down and dirty national chains,"
59:17;59:25;"burger Jack in the box. Yeah. Mickey D's Wendy's. Yeah. Wendy's. Yeah. But why can't you put them"
59:25;59:30;"in the same category just because they're smaller chains. So it's easier for them to maintain"
59:30;59:36;"quality. Is that the theory or what? Cause they are, they are fast food, different price point,"
59:36;59:39;"not in and out, in and out. It's the same price point as McDonald's or Burger King."
59:40;59:45;"I don't know. Maybe it's just a biased thing. Loving in and out. Like I put it as like a special"
59:45;59:50;"thing, maybe like it's more special. Like we're getting in and out is like more different than"
59:50;59:53;"like, Oh, we're driving by McDonald's. Let's get McDonald's. I mean, I think it's like to"
59:53;59:58;"in and outs credit that they're in the same industry essentially as McDonald's, but their"
59:58;01:00:03;"product is so like, good point. Good point. So much higher. No, that's true. But I think,"
01:00:03;01:00:08;"but I think Jake, in some ways you answered your own question where in and out maintains that"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"quality and famously people are always like, man, they got to, why isn't there in and out in New"
01:00:12;01:00:17;"York? And it's because the family that runs in and out or whoever, you know, it's going to up"
01:00:17;01:00:20;"their supply chains. They don't want to be like shipping stuff that far. They, there's a reason"
01:00:20;01:00:25;"that they stay small. So in that sense, I think your point about that they're different in terms"
01:00:25;01:00:31;"of their national visibility, how big they are, that kind of tracks to me that places them in"
01:00:31;01:00:36;"slightly different categories. Also, it's like Supreme. It's like when it's harder to get,"
01:00:37;01:00:43;"you stay more like high end and relevant and the quality stays high when there's not a hundred of"
01:00:43;01:00:47;"them all over the place. Right. High demand. So what's so special about Carl's Jr."
01:00:47;01:00:52;"Carl's Jr. To me is like, um, if McDonald's is let's say holo,"
01:00:52;01:01:01;"Tommy Hilfiger, Burger King's Tommy Hilfiger,"
01:01:01;01:01:09;"Nautica. Carl's Jr. is Nautica, which is like the dope is more Helly Hansen."
01:01:09;01:01:14;"Like the dopest one. You don't think about it as much as polo, but you're like, you know what?"
01:01:14;01:01:19;"Solid. Cool. When you see someone wearing it, you're like, Oh, props. You're tight."
01:01:19;01:01:25;"You know, it is like Nautica or Helly Hansen. And then I think Burger King is Tommy Hilfiger"
01:01:25;01:01:32;"for sure. And then I want to find out what, uh, what Jack and the bar. I just, I just haven't"
01:01:32;01:01:37;"had Burger King that much in my life. Like our Whoppers is good. I think there was a period when"
01:01:37;01:01:42;"Burger King was good. And they, they also were pretty dope. The chicken fries were kind of a"
01:01:42;01:01:46;"thing. Like they were like a gimmick. And then they stopped doing it. Well, you know, it's funny"
01:01:46;01:01:51;"because I forgot what airport is, whatever airport I fly New York to LA and vice versa, whatever"
01:01:51;01:01:57;"airline I'm on the terminal sucks. Like, I'm always jealous. Like I forgot the airline. Like"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"whenever I'm talking to a friend, like one of you guys, it's like, you're like, yeah, there's like"
01:02:01;01:02:07;"a five guys and there's a like taco truck and like, uh, you know, there's like a blue bottle"
01:02:07;01:02:13;"or whatever. And it's like the one I fly, it's straight up just like Burger King and like"
01:02:13;01:02:18;"whatever. If like Sbarro got shut down and called something else."
01:02:20;01:02:24;"So I have had Burger King on those, some of those lonely flights, you know, where you're like,"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"you need a little pick me up like a treat. But the chicken fries are legitimately good."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Yeah. They're fire. They're, they are good. Yeah."
01:02:30;01:02:38;"I met her at the Burger King, filled up my soda machine. So we took the car to Amsterdam,"
01:02:38;01:02:46;"the kids were hanging out all around. Then we went down to Coney Island, on the coast and around again."
01:02:46;01:02:54;"And we don't care if the parents are fat, or she's white, we are alright. Oh yeah."
01:02:54;01:03:13;"Oh, oh, I love us all. Oh, oh, I love us all. Oh, oh, I love us all. Oh, oh, I love us all."
01:03:13;01:03:17;"Yo, you know what we could talk about? All I've been watching the whole quarantine,"
01:03:17;01:03:23;"me and Gianna started Jersey Shore from episode one. And now we're all the way to season two"
01:03:23;01:03:28;"family vacation. Well, cause Jersey Shore, like, I feel like the first season made such a huge"
01:03:28;01:03:33;"splash. I vaguely remember the second one, but it's like, they just kept going. Well,"
01:03:33;01:03:37;"I don't mean to bail on our other conversation. Sorry. I feel like I don't know. It's all right."
01:03:37;01:03:43;"I think we've covered it. You know, we figured it out. It was genius. So they filmed the first"
01:03:43;01:03:51;"season summer, right? Summer in Jersey Shore. Clearly MTV realizes, oh my God, like we have"
01:03:51;01:04:00;"a banger. Right? So they go straight from the original Jersey Shore house straight to Miami"
01:04:00;01:04:06;"for the winter. And they do season two and they're like, oh my God. And then I think midway through"
01:04:06;01:04:11;"season two or something, season one airs or after they finished season two, season one airs, I think"
01:04:11;01:04:19;"after the winter, they go to Italy and then they go back to Jersey Shore. So it's really in this"
01:04:19;01:04:26;"really short period of time. It's four seasons. Yeah. Like they just kept them going and then"
01:04:26;01:04:31;"fame hits kind of like halfway through. So it's interesting. The second two, they're like famous."
01:04:31;01:04:35;"I mean, that first season was incredible. That was like a really exciting moment."
01:04:35;01:04:40;"Dude, the whole thing is a masterpiece. Pauly D is as funny as any of the comedic actors I've ever"
01:04:40;01:04:43;"worked with. Like Pauly, he's straight up like hilarious."
01:04:43;01:04:48;"He's great. And I mean, the situation is such a fascinating kind of tragic figure."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"I believe he's in prison right now with Bernie Madoff."
01:04:51;01:04:56;"No, no. So actually the situation, the situation is really inspiring figure."
01:04:56;01:05:01;"Unfortunately, it's Ronnie who's having the most troubles right now."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"Oh, what's the story?"
01:05:02;01:05:06;"In a gnarly relationship with his baby mama and they keep getting into fights on TMZ and"
01:05:06;01:05:16;"it's kind of hectic, right? Mike got sober, did his time. But even before he does his time,"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"there's a season. The whole thing is all on the show. Him getting sentenced,"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"going away, him getting out of jail. Yeah, it's incredible."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"I totally missed that."
01:05:23;01:05:25;"It's remarkable. It's like amazing. And so-"
01:05:25;01:05:29;"It's just like Jersey Shore season five, the trial of Michael Sorrentino."
01:05:29;01:05:33;"They all go to the what's it called? Arraignment where you get your sentencing."
01:05:33;01:05:34;"Really?"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"Yeah."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Snooki, Snooki and everybody."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"All the homies are there. Yeah, like Snooki and Pauly D and shit."
01:05:39;01:05:43;"And they're like chilling there and it's like 14 months and they're like, ""No!"""
01:05:43;01:05:49;"Oh, I had no idea that it took like... I mean, I remember kind of seeing that in the news,"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"but I didn't know that was on the show. Wait, but so then-"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"And then you see him getting out."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"So he turned his life around."
01:05:54;01:06:00;"He's amazing. He's such a sweet guy. It's like you love him. You love him now. And he was such"
01:06:00;01:06:06;"a jerk and now he's like such a kind kind of thoughtful guy. He seems really sweet."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"I got a question for both of you. Have you guys ever been down the shore?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"No."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"No."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Isn't that part of like the intro? I'm going down the shore."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Is that around like Asbury Park? Is that the- that's the shore, right?"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"I could do the whole intro for you."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Oh, please."
01:06:20;01:06:24;"I think they were in there. A lot of the first season was in Seaside Heights, but-"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"All the Jersey stuff is Seaside Heights."
01:06:27;01:06:31;"It's Seaside Heights because that's like a big town that I've been to."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"The Jersey Shore is very long. That's an interesting thing."
01:06:34;01:06:38;"I was just thinking about that with Jersey. Like part of the reason that the Jersey Shore"
01:06:38;01:06:44;"is such a thing is that there's not that many East Coast states that have such a long, unbroken,"
01:06:44;01:06:50;"somewhat straight shoreline like that. Like, you know, Connecticut, you got all these funky"
01:06:50;01:06:55;"little islands and rocky beaches. And, you know, Rhode Island's a real mess. I mean,"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"it's beautiful, but Rhode Island, the bottom of Rhode Island is like Greece,"
01:06:58;01:07:03;"like all these weird little inlets and stuff. And then Massachusetts, you have Cape Cod,"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"which is its own thing. But Jersey Shore is just kind of like this-"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"Yeah."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"Once you get past Bruce Springsteen country, that little bump near where he lives,"
01:07:10;01:07:14;"then it's kind of like this straight thing. And there's like a lot of shore towns. And so"
01:07:14;01:07:19;"some of them are really far away from each other. Like growing up, I had a friend whose family"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"would always go to Wildwood, New Jersey, which was similar to Seaside Heights in a way. Had"
01:07:23;01:07:29;"like a cool boardwalk and you would get like, you know, cheese balls and, you know,"
01:07:29;01:07:34;"like shoot a gun at a clown and win a CD or something like that. So I'm very familiar with"
01:07:34;01:07:39;"that side of it. And then there's also these like other towns that are a little like bougier."
01:07:39;01:07:45;"They all have like a different character. But one thing about Jersey Shore, this is not explicitly"
01:07:45;01:07:50;"connected to Jersey Shore, although I must have some relationships. And Jonah, you know, before"
01:07:50;01:07:54;"Jersey Shore started, there were two MTV-"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"MTV True Lives."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"That guy's amazing. Dominic. I've seen it. Yeah."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"Okay. So that kind of like paved the way for Jersey Shore, the show."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"It was a True Life. True Life Jersey Shore."
01:08:02;01:08:02;"True Life."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Like I'm getting a share house."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Yeah."
01:08:05;01:08:09;"Yeah. True Life, colon. I'm going down to Jersey Shore. And so the first one was a dude. And those"
01:08:09;01:08:13;"both had a big impact on me because, you know, I was in real time. I was in Jersey."
01:08:13;01:08:19;"Dude, True Life doesn't get enough props. True Life is an amazing show."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"Yeah. Like strongly agree."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"And really well done."
01:08:21;01:08:25;"And I kind of feel bad for that guy because he was like the original Jersey Shore guy."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"And he, I remember he was like-"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"He was like 40, dude."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"He was kind of old. And I feel like he was kind of looking for love down the shore,"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"but also getting really dry. It was all the same themes were already present."
01:08:35;01:08:40;"And I just remember that dude used this phrase in it that me and my friends became obsessed with"
01:08:40;01:08:45;"because he was like, man, I love going down to Jersey Shore, you know, get away from it all."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"You know, I love that North Jersey hustle and bustle, but then you get down the shore,"
01:08:48;01:08:52;"you can relax. And there's like something that to us, that North Jersey hustle and bustle,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"because we grew up in North Jersey."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"So I love the idea of like, get in the car for, you know, an hour, get away from that"
01:08:58;01:09:03;"North Jersey hustle and bustle. So then the second one that they made after they focused on a guy,"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"they focused on a woman."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Right."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"And that woman, her name was Dottie Ortega."
01:09:07;01:09:11;"And she's four years older than me. And she went to my high school."
01:09:11;01:09:16;"So this is like a really big deal that the follow up to the first Jersey Shore true life was-"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Did you know her?"
01:09:17;01:09:21;"New Jersey? No, because she would have been, you know, it's like at my school that"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"when you're in eighth grade, it was a very small town. But when you're in eighth grade,"
01:09:24;01:09:28;"you would vaguely know who all the seniors were. But unless it was like somebody's"
01:09:28;01:09:32;"sibling, you didn't know them, know them. But like, you know, it's like, you know,"
01:09:32;01:09:37;"like when you're a kid, you'd like used to look in the, at all the upperclassmen in the yearbook."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"You like knew they were kind of like celebrities. So there was this moment like,"
01:09:40;01:09:45;"""Holy s***, Dottie Ortega, wow!"" on TV. So that kind of paved the way. But those two,"
01:09:45;01:09:49;"yeah, even before Jersey Shore, those true lives were like, made a huge impact."
01:09:49;01:09:53;"There's some incredible ones. I'm going to go on a deep dive when we hang up"
01:09:53;01:09:58;"of some like true life. The coolest one I've ever seen was, there was one about"
01:09:58;01:10:05;"gay men who are obsessed with bears, like feeders, like obese, like 500 pound men."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"Right."
01:10:06;01:10:12;"And this guy is a really buff guy, goes and meets this like kind of, he's kind of like a"
01:10:12;01:10:19;"celebrity amongst the like, large, like 500 pound, like gay men community. He's like a star."
01:10:20;01:10:25;"And they go and they like have this great time together. And he kind of, they kind of explain"
01:10:25;01:10:32;"this subculture, which is like the feeder and the whatever, the eater, maybe, you know?"
01:10:32;01:10:37;"And it's just really interesting subculture I'd never heard of before, but I'm like 13"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"sitting there like, this is interesting. This is different than like TRL. Like,"
01:10:41;01:10:45;"what? It's like vice. It's like a precursor to vice."
01:10:45;01:10:49;"Yeah, exactly. I mean, MTV had such an incredible run from the real world in the"
01:10:49;01:10:54;"early nineties, all the way through the early two thousands of true life and Jersey shore of like,"
01:10:54;01:11:02;"obviously it's not all A plus, but just like, yeah, kind of like seeing their mission as like"
01:11:02;01:11:07;"exposing, you know, the youth of America. It's like the bigger world around them,"
01:11:07;01:11:11;"like ways that people, you know, there's like something really positive about elements of it."
01:11:11;01:11:16;"I thought true life was cool in that it wasn't making, I don't think it was making fun of,"
01:11:16;01:11:21;"I think they knew some of it was ridiculous, but I think they took a bunch of subcultures"
01:11:21;01:11:25;"and showed them as they were, as opposed to like, you know, spinning it too crazy."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"Jersey shore. It just happened to me. They were so nuts."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"And that was a big debate with Jersey shore because similar to when the Sopranos first"
01:11:31;01:11:36;"was on the air, you had some Italian American groups saying this is stereotypical. We hate it."
01:11:36;01:11:37;"Take it off there."
01:11:37;01:11:43;"The show they exploit that the show is different than like true life. Like the show"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Jersey exploits the characters."
01:11:46;01:11:51;"Yeah. And it's, if I was Italian, I'm sure I'd be like, Oh my God, this is insane."
01:11:51;01:11:56;"Because it's like, it's almost a very cartoonish representation,"
01:11:56;01:12:00;"but I love them. You know, I love them as people. Like I've watched the show."
01:12:00;01:12:06;"I'm obligated to say, I just want to say, so I'm very close with the woman that created it."
01:12:06;01:12:14;"Yeah. The most amazing woman. She is one of those women."
01:12:14;01:12:15;"She's Italian."
01:12:15;01:12:21;"Oh, Sally Ann Salsano, 495 productions is the company. Like she is so Jersey."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"I've seen that logo so many times."
01:12:22;01:12:31;"And she's, she's honestly, she's a maniac and she lived like, she lives there, right?"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"Like she's a real Jersey girl."
01:12:34;01:12:39;"Totally. And she sees, obviously there's like an exploitive part of the whole thing, but"
01:12:39;01:12:43;"just, I feel like, cause I've had this conversation and then I got to know her."
01:12:44;01:12:49;"And Oh, she's it. Like she loves Pauly D. Like she spends all of her time with him."
01:12:49;01:12:54;"She basically moves into the house with them and shoots it. So I think that it should give you"
01:12:54;01:12:59;"guys a certain amount. Like there's a certain respect that like, yeah, I thought you, yeah,"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"right. Exactly."
01:13:00;01:13:06;"And you can tell because that's really cool to hear. Like I, I'm obsessed with Pauly D. Like"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"I want to be friends with him so bad. He is like amazing."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"You should hire him to DJ an event."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"Dude, I can't afford him. He's like the richest guy."
01:13:14;01:13:23;"I do remember seeing the first episode and knowing there's controversy around it. And"
01:13:23;01:13:27;"there's like big enter this house. There's like a big Italian flag. And if the idea was that a"
01:13:27;01:13:33;"bunch of non-Italian people had handpicked people that they thought were going to like fight and"
01:13:33;01:13:37;"get into these like goofy situations, they're like, come to this house. And then they put a"
01:13:37;01:13:42;"huge Italian flag. I can imagine somebody looking at that being like, what is this? But if it's"
01:13:42;01:13:47;"actually Italian people making it. And one thing's for sure is that even if the beginning of the"
01:13:47;01:13:53;"show was rooted in some sort of like people wanting to see like some Jerry Springer."
01:13:53;01:13:59;"The truth is the people on the show by and large turned out to be too smart and likable to be just"
01:13:59;01:14:03;"shoved into that like goofy thing. That goofy reality TV thing."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"Although you gave me a funny idea. It'd be hilarious if I made a show."
01:14:06;01:14:10;"That was like all Jews like accountants."
01:14:10;01:14:13;"And giant star of David."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"Yeah, like just like whatever this biggest like Hossein's in like the"
01:14:17;01:14:21;"Hossein accountants. And it's like just the casting call is just like the biggest stereotypes."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Like, are you?"
01:14:22;01:14:29;"Yeah, exactly. And then like, there'd be like an uproar. And then I'd be Jewish and they"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"wouldn't know what to do. Well, I feel like the Southies were worried about that. And I"
01:14:33;01:14:38;"don't think it really happened. I think they were worried about that on Uncut Gems. Like,"
01:14:38;01:14:42;"I think they were worried about Jews getting pissed off about their portrayal of like,"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"a guy, a stereotyped character, right?"
01:14:45;01:14:52;"Like his relationship to money, his duplicitousness. Yeah, maybe there was one or two things like that."
01:14:52;01:14:56;"It definitely wasn't the yeah, it wasn't land. It didn't land. Yeah, there Yeah,"
01:14:56;01:15:00;"there was no Jewish organization, which happened with Jersey Shore, the Italian version. There's"
01:15:00;01:15:06;"no Jewish organization that was like, boycott this film. Right? It was all Jews who saw it,"
01:15:06;01:15:13;"probably. Yeah. Thanks for having me guys. Thanks so much. Great to see you. Bye, boys."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"Peace."
01:15:14;01:15:20;"We're living here in Allentown. And they're closing all the factories down."
01:15:20;01:15:29;"Out in Bethlehem they're killing time. Filling half-empty standing lines."
01:15:29;01:15:37;"When our fathers fought the Second World War. Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore."
01:15:38;01:15:45;"Met our mothers from the US, oh. Asked them to dance, dance with us, oh."
01:15:45;01:15:50;"And we're living here in Allentown."
01:15:50;01:15:56;"This is a real stacked episode of a time crisis sneaker talk. We got one more guest coming."
01:15:56;01:16:01;"And Jake, this is somebody that I initially know through you, Aaron, that has a project called LA"
01:16:01;01:16:06;"Takedown and also a member of Richard Pictures. But since I know him through you, why don't you"
01:16:06;01:16:11;"set up, give him a little intro. Yeah. Aaron Olson has a great band called LA"
01:16:11;01:16:18;"Takedown, which put out a record called Our Feeling of Natural High. They put it out the week"
01:16:18;01:16:24;"that, I think like Friday, March 13th, like the week that like the entire United States shut down."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Just shut down. Yeah."
01:16:25;01:16:30;"And we have to ask Aaron about this, but I remember he had, there was a record release show"
01:16:30;01:16:36;"booked for Friday, March 13th that was canceled, but for the show, they were going to do all doors"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"covers, which is a strong move. Oh, right. I remember hearing about this."
01:16:39;01:16:43;"For a record release show. We have to ask him about that. And so, yeah, and Aaron,"
01:16:43;01:16:47;"and I also want to ask him, I think it was his idea to start Richard Pictures."
01:16:47;01:16:53;"So anyway, I've been playing music with Aaron for like five, six years at this point."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Right. And so he's a tight,"
01:16:54;01:16:58;"tight friend. And Aaron plays bass in Richard Pictures."
01:16:58;01:17:03;"Bass in Richard Pictures, bass in Mountain Bruise, and he's the kind of composer guitarist"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"in LA Takedown. Right. So he's a multi-instrumentalist,"
01:17:05;01:17:09;"but I've often been struck. I mean, all you guys are great in Richard Pictures, but,"
01:17:09;01:17:14;"you know, Phil Lesh, an important member of the dead and him holding it down. And I've also been"
01:17:14;01:17:19;"struck. And I even talked about a little bit with Baio because, you know, Vampire's taken"
01:17:19;01:17:24;"Mountain Bruise into our repertoire. So, you know, all the people in our band had to study those"
01:17:24;01:17:28;"parts. And I remember listening to this song, I was like, ""Oh, damn, it's a little workout for"
01:17:28;01:17:33;"Baio."" And I think he had fun learning those parts. Because that's like, specifically on the"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Mountain Bruise song, Mountain Bruise. Yes."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"Like the bass is so alive and fun. It's fierce."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Yes. Really great performance."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"Yeah. Let's get Aaron on the horn."
01:17:41;01:17:45;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:17:45;01:17:50;"Aaron. Aaron, you there, bud?"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Aaron? Yes."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Welcome to the show, Aaron. Very happy to have you."
01:17:54;01:17:58;"Thanks. I'm happy to be here. Can you guys hear me OK and stuff?"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"Hear you great."
01:18:00;01:18:00;"Totally."
01:18:00;01:18:02;"I'm kind of a silhouette."
01:18:02;01:18:08;"We were just talking about that you had the crazy timing of having your record dropped"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"on March 13th."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"Yeah."
01:18:11;01:18:17;"We want to talk specifically about the scheduled album release show in which you were going to"
01:18:17;01:18:21;"cover The Doors, but that'll probably turn into a three hour conversation. So before we get to that,"
01:18:22;01:18:26;"I'm sure people would just be interested, just as like, just a musician, been working on a record,"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"like, what were those like couple weeks leading up to that? Like,"
01:18:29;01:18:34;"It was an ominous day, being Friday the 13th anyways. And we were kind of like,"
01:18:34;01:18:40;"I'm not superstitious, so I didn't really think much of that. But I mean, I was just excited."
01:18:40;01:18:45;"I was like, ready for this album to come out. I've been working on it for a pretty long time."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Then I got sick, actually."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"Oh, wait, did you have COVID?"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"I don't think so. But my wife thinks I did."
01:18:51;01:18:56;"I think you did, man. It seemed like you did. I know you didn't test positive for it, but"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"That was later anyways."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"Similar to Hannah, my wife, she was also incredibly sick. And it was sort of like,"
01:19:01;01:19:06;"it just felt it's very specific symptoms. But I remember, dude, I remember like,"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"the day before the show was supposed to happen. It was still,"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"it was in those that period of days where things were changing very quickly."
01:19:13;01:19:17;"Well, yeah, that's what I'm curious about. Because the week of March 13th,"
01:19:17;01:19:17;"Okay."
01:19:17;01:19:23;"The Tuesday before that Friday was when the NBA and Coachella were canceled. So I imagine"
01:19:23;01:19:28;"you were kind of like monitoring the situation like, like everybody was, but you actually had"
01:19:28;01:19:34;"a show that week at an album release party, being kind of like, what's going to happen here? So like,"
01:19:34;01:19:34;"Yeah."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"When did that show actually get canceled?"
01:19:37;01:19:42;"Yeah, we had like practice, I think that Tuesday night. And I remember being at the practice."
01:19:42;01:19:47;"And like, word came through that the NBA was closed, or whatever. And like,"
01:19:47;01:19:54;"yeah, that was definitely a sign. But I was also going to do a tour, like the next week or"
01:19:54;01:20:00;"something in another band. And so in my mind, I was in the discussion we had was kind of like,"
01:20:00;01:20:08;"well, if the venues are still open, then it's on them to close or not have the show. That's where"
01:20:08;01:20:14;"what we were thinking that week. And then so creeping up to the show, we had a practice,"
01:20:14;01:20:18;"I think it was the night before, or maybe it was Tuesday and Wednesday, we'd practice it's"
01:20:18;01:20:26;"Wednesday night. Jessica, who is, is the Jim Morrison of the doors outfit, was pretty sick"
01:20:26;01:20:35;"at practice. She was coughing quite a bit. And various people in the band were concerned to"
01:20:35;01:20:39;"different levels. I was kind of just like shows happening, like, whatever, like, just"
01:20:39;01:20:43;"when were you sick? Was that like a couple weeks before the big?"
01:20:43;01:20:46;"So I got sick the next day."
01:20:46;01:20:51;"Oh, all right. So you may have caught something from the Jim Morrison of the outfit."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"Indeed. Typical, right? Yeah."
01:20:54;01:21:02;"Leave it to Jim. But yeah, so the next day, I went to work. And I noticed that work out."
01:21:02;01:21:07;"Jesus, the next day, I had like active shooter training at work. I just remember like going"
01:21:07;01:21:12;"into work. And then I think I was scheduled to go into time crisis that night, actually."
01:21:12;01:21:13;"Right? Oh, yeah."
01:21:13;01:21:17;"Yeah. So that was like, kind of a full day for me. I was like, Okay, I'm going into"
01:21:17;01:21:21;"to work at the library, we're having an active shooter training, that's going to be gnarly,"
01:21:21;01:21:28;"then I drive across town to this thing. And so during the active shooter training, when we're"
01:21:28;01:21:32;"all sitting there trying to be quiet, I'm noticing that I am suppressing a cough. And then by"
01:21:32;01:21:37;"the end of the day, I'm like, I have a cough. And then the next day, which is the album release show,"
01:21:37;01:21:43;"I was ill, like quite ill. My wife and I were like, Well, what do we do? Like, I think we have"
01:21:43;01:21:48;"to cancel the show. So we canceled the show. And then we're like, well, we can still go there and"
01:21:48;01:21:55;"like sell the album. Because it is going to be at a record store venue. And then that quickly just"
01:21:55;01:22:00;"became apparent that that was a bad idea, too. And then it was just off."
01:22:00;01:22:04;"Okay, so one question I have is now, well, I guess also, it's interesting for our listeners,"
01:22:04;01:22:10;"if they don't know, LA Takedown is kind of to describe the vibe of the band. Because"
01:22:10;01:22:14;"LA Takedown is named after a Michael Mann film, correct?"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"Yeah. TV movie."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"Oh, a TV movie. I mean, I have my own vague impression of kind of like,"
01:22:19;01:22:26;"the palette of LA Takedown. But like, how do you generally describe it? I mean, I think the fact"
01:22:26;01:22:30;"that this connection of Michael Mann, if anybody's familiar with his work, especially like his early"
01:22:30;01:22:35;"work, I think that kind of is very evocative, and kind of related to your music. But like,"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"yeah, how do you describe the music of LA Takedown?"
01:22:38;01:22:43;"I describe it as kind of mostly instrumental. It's kind of changed through the years, I guess."
01:22:43;01:22:51;"I probably wouldn't name it LA Takedown now. But it's like instrumental, soundtracky music"
01:22:52;01:22:57;"with harmonized guitar leads, mostly. That's like what I tell people. And then half the time,"
01:22:57;01:23:04;"I get a blank look. So I need to think of something better. Probably. Tangerine Dream"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"ish or something like, guitar solos."
01:23:07;01:23:15;"Yeah, kraut rock, synthy. It's moody and evocative and textured. It doesn't"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"particularly sound like The Doors."
01:23:20;01:23:27;"That's a fair assessment. Yes, I can safely say it is not at all influenced by the music of The"
01:23:27;01:23:27;"Doors."
01:23:27;01:23:32;"Actually, you know what it makes me think, though? It's actually like a really fascinating"
01:23:32;01:23:38;"thought exercise to be like, what if Jim Morrison hadn't died, and The Doors actually became the"
01:23:38;01:23:42;"American Rolling Stones. And like, they went through like late 70s, they did kind of like"
01:23:42;01:23:49;"a some girls punk disco record. And then like in the 80s, they actually got in to some like"
01:23:49;01:23:54;"Tangerine Dream, Michael Mann movie vibes. Is it possible that The Doors could have dropped like"
01:23:54;01:24:01;"a 1985 masterpiece album that was like, like an LA woman revisited? And Morrison just like,"
01:24:01;01:24:05;"I mean, you're familiar with our classic album, LA Woman. I asked myself the question,"
01:24:05;01:24:09;"who is the LA woman of 1985? I want to understand this woman."
01:24:09;01:24:18;"No. I think that like, I bet they would have kept on making albums, but I think they"
01:24:18;01:24:24;"wouldn't have been good judging from like, I've listened to Ray Manzarek stuff later on."
01:24:24;01:24:29;"And I was thinking, like, I'm always interested when people get synthy in the 80s."
01:24:29;01:24:34;"Yes. And like, I was like, okay, Manzarek's definitely gonna get into like arpeggiators"
01:24:34;01:24:40;"and like all this textural synthy stuff. And like, everything I've heard was gravely disappointing."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"He didn't have a Herbie Hancock-esque"
01:24:42;01:24:46;"rebirth with the new wave of synths in the 80s?"
01:24:46;01:24:55;"No."
01:24:56;01:25:02;"No."
01:25:03;01:25:10;"No."
01:25:10;01:25:31;"But are you a Doors fan? What made you on the release date of your new LA Takedown record"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"want to do a Doors tribute?"
01:25:33;01:25:40;"Well, I'll say this, being in a Doors cover band made me like the Doors more. Or maybe even period."
01:25:40;01:25:46;"The band came about because Richard Pictures was playing a show out in the desert. And we all,"
01:25:46;01:25:56;"Moe's, the scientist amongst the group, had a bottle of like, microdose, I guess, acid."
01:25:57;01:26:03;"And so we all took some. And for me, it definitely turned more into a macrodose situation. And we"
01:26:03;01:26:08;"were sound checking. And I remember Aram was there, who also has filled in for me before,"
01:26:08;01:26:13;"now plays in the band full time. But I remember looking at him being like, dude, can you play for"
01:26:13;01:26:17;"me? Because I don't think I can do this. Like, I was like, getting shivery. And like, I couldn't"
01:26:17;01:26:22;"like play a note. And then he was like, I'm left handed. No. And then whatever. And then we had to"
01:26:22;01:26:28;"play the show. Jessica Espolita was there. She plays in LA Takedown. After we played, she was"
01:26:28;01:26:36;"like, guys, my 40th birthday is next week. Will you be a Doors cover band for it? And I'll be Jim"
01:26:36;01:26:41;"Morrison. And we'll do it at Gold Diggers, which is, you know, a small place where we've actually"
01:26:41;01:26:47;"done a thing for Jake's birthday too. And we're all like, under the influence of something. And"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"we're like, yeah, that sounds great. Like, I didn't even think about if I like the Doors or not. I"
01:26:51;01:26:58;"was just like, that sounds fun. And so we had to practice and then we played the show. And I gotta"
01:26:58;01:27:04;"say like Jessica and play it's through playing the music probably that I grew in appreciation"
01:27:04;01:27:10;"and through Jessica's enthusiasm. But like most people, maybe our age, I thought they were super"
01:27:10;01:27:16;"cool when I was a kid when that movie came out. I had that double CD, or Jim's all like shirtless."
01:27:17;01:27:23;"I had that too. Like my Cub Scout video submission for like the video contest was"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"a music video set to People Are Strange."
01:27:26;01:27:35;"But then like, I got into junior high and high school and I just, I was over it. I thought he"
01:27:35;01:27:40;"was pretty lame. Well, I got another, was it also that obviously you're multi instrumentalist,"
01:27:40;01:27:45;"but we were singing your praises as a basis, notably on the studio recording of a Mountain"
01:27:45;01:27:51;"Brews song. But did it have anything to do with your growth as a basis? Did you come to resent"
01:27:51;01:27:58;"the bass with Doors? No. And you know what, I think that's a misconception about the Doors."
01:27:58;01:28:04;"Honestly, they have bass on the record. They have so much bass on the record. Like,"
01:28:04;01:28:09;"I played bass in the Doors cover band. But in the Doors cover band community,"
01:28:09;01:28:13;"is that like a fork in the road? It's like where some people just like guys,"
01:28:13;01:28:19;"the Doors didn't roll with the bass live. This sounds nothing like the historical live recordings"
01:28:19;01:28:23;"of the Doors and other people like we're paying tribute to the recordings, which is how most"
01:28:23;01:28:30;"people know the Doors. Like, is that a big bone of contention in the community? I hope so. I'm"
01:28:30;01:28:39;"happy to say I'm not very in touch with the Doors cover band community. But I hope that I hope that's"
01:28:39;01:28:43;"a real dividing line. That'd be rad. How much crossover do you think there is between"
01:28:43;01:28:49;"the dead and the Doors as somebody who's very versed in the music of both? Have you ever"
01:28:49;01:28:53;"gotten into like hot water where somebody's like, Oh, man, like, Oh, you're in a dead cover band"
01:28:53;01:28:58;"that rules like, you know, and then you somehow reference the fact that you've done Doors covers"
01:28:58;01:29:03;"and they're just like, really? Or do a lot of people like people, they're like two great"
01:29:03;01:29:08;"California bands that began in the 60s. Love it. I'd love to see the actual Venn diagram of this."
01:29:09;01:29:16;"But I haven't really figured that out. I mean, honestly, I'm kind of careful. I'm gonna like,"
01:29:16;01:29:22;"I don't spring the fact that I'm in a dead cover band to people like off the bat. Yeah."
01:29:22;01:29:30;"I kind of have to feel it out. Like at my work. I don't think I told anyone until like two years in"
01:29:30;01:29:35;"playing a dead cover band. I mean, it's also like, but they knew about LA Takedown."
01:29:35;01:29:41;"Yeah, like I talked about that. Sorry, Jake. To bury our band. I also didn't mention Mountain"
01:29:41;01:29:47;"Bruce. But yeah, they're going to understand. No offense taken. I'm understandable. LA Takedown"
01:29:47;01:29:52;"is your songwriting vehicle. Yeah, yeah. It's takes precedence. No, I would say to further"
01:29:52;01:29:57;"complicate matters, Aaron. Not only are you in a Doors and dead cover band, but you were in a"
01:29:57;01:30:04;"short lived Eagles cover band. Hell yeah. With me. Which was called Dick Picks Presents Barely"
01:30:04;01:30:11;"Eagles. Correct. No, we never actually played a show, but we did practice like 10 times and we"
01:30:11;01:30:17;"were kind of good. And I think that'll happen sometime that we actually like play a Barely"
01:30:17;01:30:25;"Eagles show. I hope so. I also got to say like that the especially with you guys being based in"
01:30:25;01:30:31;"LA. I think you should take it to the limit and the sky's the limit for what what an Eagles cover"
01:30:31;01:30:38;"band could do. I think that could really tap into something. Barely Eagles has must fly. I mean,"
01:30:38;01:30:44;"that's going to happen. Yeah, you are. Yeah, I remember you saying that to me with a sense of"
01:30:44;01:30:49;"affection, but also a slight amount of derision. You're like, dude, you are Glenn Fry."
01:30:49;01:30:59;"I was also like, completely hammered. Oh, yeah. But it makes sense because Jake's the Bob Weir"
01:30:59;01:31:04;"of Richard Pictures and Glenn Fry's the Bob Weir of the Eagles. I'm the most pedestrian musician"
01:31:04;01:31:10;"in Richard Pictures and Barely Eagles. I'm good with it. I'm you know, I'm like a"
01:31:10;01:31:16;"important pillar of the band. But yeah, Bob Weir and the Glenn Fry. It's not a sexy role."
01:31:16;01:31:24;"Not to some. To moms. I think moms like them. That's true. All right,"
01:31:24;01:31:28;"guys, we should get into the top five now. Aaron, you're going to join us for the top five."
01:31:28;01:31:35;"Yeah. It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:31:35;01:31:40;"Generally with the top five, we compare the top five songs on the Apple Music Top 100 Global"
01:31:40;01:31:46;"chart right now with the top five Billboard hits of another era. Aaron, you chose the year that we"
01:31:46;01:31:54;"were going to compare 2022 and you chose 1985. Why is that? That's the year of my birth. So"
01:31:55;01:32:00;"what's going on there? All right. Well, we're about to find out the number five song this week"
01:32:00;01:32:15;"in 1985, Suddenly by Billy Ocean. I'm a fake Billy Ocean fan because I really only know"
01:32:15;01:32:23;"Caribbean Queen. I think you know this song. I used to think that love was just a fairy tale."
01:32:23;01:32:32;"Until that first great voice. Until that first smile."
01:32:32;01:32:37;"But if I had to do it all again,"
01:32:41;01:32:48;"I wouldn't change a thing because this love is everlasting. Suddenly,"
01:32:48;01:33:04;"life has new meaning to me. There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of."
01:33:04;01:33:09;"This is such an Elton John song. I like him talking about noticing things you never take"
01:33:09;01:33:20;"notice of. The refrain is kind of the stranger, Billy Joel. Yeah. All right. I get the idea."
01:33:20;01:33:28;"That's a strong song. Vice coined it the best after party song ever. Okay. After what kind of"
01:33:28;01:33:35;"party? They gave LA Takedown worst album cover once. Wait, which cover? For the self-titled"
01:33:35;01:33:40;"album. It's just like our logo with the sunset in it. That's a cool cover. That's a cover. And"
01:33:40;01:33:46;"I've always thought that the other one, the kind of airbrush looking picture of the fingers holding"
01:33:46;01:33:51;"the screw. That's an amazing cover. Thanks. Well, backstory on that. Yeah. What's the backstory on"
01:33:51;01:34:01;"that? My dad painted that 1975. It's the only painting he's ever done. Whoa. Five feet. Oh,"
01:34:01;01:34:06;"really? And is it airbrushed or it's like acrylic or whatever? He says it's acrylic. I think it's"
01:34:06;01:34:11;"airbrushed though. Can you airbrush acrylic? Yes. That's what you airbrush with. It has such a"
01:34:11;01:34:18;"sharpness. The number five song in 2020 is Drake Toosie Slide. I don't know if we have anything"
01:34:18;01:34:23;"new to say about this. I mean, yeah, this is going deep. How long has this been? I think we"
01:34:23;01:34:36;"first talked about it like a month ago. I don't think we have anything new to say about the song,"
01:34:36;01:34:42;"but hearing Drake talk about Nike makes me wonder. We talked last time about how many rappers have"
01:34:42;01:34:47;"ever referenced Jeff Bezos. Has the rapper referenced the Chunky Dunkys yet? And if not,"
01:34:47;01:34:53;"who will be the first? Now that the Chunky Dunkys are officially a phenomenon, an iconic shoe with"
01:34:53;01:34:59;"a high resale value, might there even just be a song straight up called Chunky Dunky? For sure."
01:34:59;01:35:07;"You got a high resale value. You're my Chunky Dunky. Chunky Dunky. Maybe we should make it,"
01:35:07;01:35:12;"just try to make it like a TikTok song. Just cash in real hard. The world needs that. The world"
01:35:12;01:35:18;"always needs a TikTok song about whatever's happening. The number four song, this is a heavy"
01:35:18;01:35:25;"hitter. Back in '85, the year of Aaron's birth, Simple Minds, Don't You Forget About Me, from"
01:35:25;01:35:32;"which soundtrack, fellas? Breakfast Club. Yeah. Wait, play the opening again. Just like the first"
01:35:32;01:35:43;"three seconds are just so evocative of the song. It's the first two notes. You just get the vibe."
01:35:43;01:35:52;"It's almost like the it's been of, what the f*** is that? You know what I mean? It's two words."
01:35:52;01:35:57;"Bare Naked Ladies? Yeah. It's like those first two words. All you need is it's been and you"
01:35:57;01:36:03;"know where you're going. It's cool starting off with a snare hit too. Yeah. That's a cool way"
01:36:03;01:36:09;"to start a song. According to the songwriter, Keith Forsey, Brian Ferry of Roxy Music was his"
01:36:09;01:36:15;"first choice to record it, but he passed. Man, this would have been a great mid-80s Brian Ferry"
01:36:15;01:36:20;"song. Absolutely. I can picture his voice on it. Yeah. I love Brian Ferry, by the way."
01:36:20;01:36:35;"Don't you. So is that the biggest Simple Minds song? Certainly in the US. They're that type of"
01:36:35;01:36:41;"band that in the UK probably had like 10 other top 10 hits, but not in the US. The number four song"
01:36:41;01:36:49;"2020, Gunna, Dollars on My Head featuring Young Thug from his new hit album, Wanna."
01:36:49;01:37:04;"I've been getting it since a toddler. I keep dollars on my head. Been a real one. This my"
01:37:04;01:37:10;"model. Hella my problems. I ain't scared. I put powder on my collar cause she proud of what I said."
01:37:10;01:37:15;"I'm a leader. I got on follow. And my footsteps like the feds. I shoot like I'm Montana. Chop up"
01:37:15;01:37:21;"bullets. Black on black. New Phantom in the backseat sipping red. Jump from Atlanta."
01:37:21;01:37:28;"Condo like the pharmacy. I got codeine in my fridge. He's talking about a fridge."
01:37:28;01:37:36;"I feel like that's a TC first. Is a song where somebody actually talks about their fridge."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"And he's keeping codeine in it. I have to assume it's the second fridge."
01:37:41;01:37:46;"He says condo like the pharmacy. I got codeine in my fridge. He's implying there's so many drugs"
01:37:46;01:37:51;"in the condo. Yeah. He's got a second fridge for codeine. Hope he's okay. It's a lot of"
01:37:51;01:37:58;"prescriptions. It's not all for him. Okay. Who is that? It's Gunna. And I love that he"
01:37:58;01:38:09;"calls his album Wanna. I like rhyming album titles. I like this song. There's like a big,"
01:38:10;01:38:16;"it's like a very mellow but kind of melancholic beat. I mean, Mike will made it. We haven't heard"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"him in the top five in a while, but he's like, definitely the best producer of this generation."
01:38:19;01:38:25;"This is like, it's kind of like a sweet sadness to it. I mean, pretty typical of the era. A lot"
01:38:25;01:38:30;"of these top five songs from 2020 kind of blur together for me, but I'm a, I'm an old guy,"
01:38:30;01:38:36;"but typical in the sense of being that kind of melancholic. Yeah. That same production. Yeah."
01:38:37;01:38:42;"Similar kind of be just sort of like the sand. Like, I don't know. I will say, I don't know that"
01:38:42;01:38:48;"much about gun. I mean, his delivery, he's got a very pleasant voice to listen to. He does. I think"
01:38:48;01:38:52;"so. He's got, I like that kind of like laid back delivery. It's chill. It's chill. A lot of the"
01:38:52;01:38:57;"best Atlanta rappers. I like, I've always liked 21 Savage for the same reason. It's like, it's very"
01:38:57;01:39:05;"kind of mellow delivery. The number three song this week in 1985, another soundtrack song. There's"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"some major soundtracks in the mid eighties. This one's from Beverly Hills cop. And you might know"
01:39:09;01:39:15;"the song Axel F. Oh, hell yeah. First two Axel Foley, the character played by Eddie Murphy."
01:39:15;01:39:20;"Wow. Artist is Harold Foltermeyer who made this. I was just thinking about the song. Cause I was"
01:39:20;01:39:27;"like listening to the song crazy frog, which was like the birth of this weird kind of concept that"
01:39:27;01:39:32;"still exists today, which is like computer animated videos of annoying characters set to like"
01:39:32;01:39:38;"European techno, which somehow 15 years later is still like a phenomenon. And you look at all these"
01:39:38;01:39:44;"videos, like crazy frog gummy bear one. They always have like 2 billion views on YouTube."
01:39:44;01:39:54;"Now this is not a joke, but the B side of this is actually really good. It's called shootout"
01:39:54;01:40:00;"instrumental. Yeah. I have this 45 for some reason. I mean, I like, I like, I like Harold"
01:40:00;01:40:05;"Foltermeyer. He's red. He's cool. But it's, and I understand people are into soundtracks. It's"
01:40:05;01:40:13;"just hilarious to imagine millions of Americans went out and bought a 45 single of this piece of"
01:40:13;01:40:18;"instrumental music and just like got home and just like, yo, throw an X left. It's like, hell yeah."
01:40:18;01:40:24;"Aaron, do you know the Harold Foltermeyer story? Like what was he doing in the seventies? Like"
01:40:24;01:40:30;"I have my own speculations that might be based on research or maybe I made them up and I"
01:40:30;01:40:36;"can't remember, but I think, I feel like he was an underling of Maroder. Like he came up"
01:40:36;01:40:44;"under Giorgio Maroder. They definitely collaborated on the Top Gun team. They co-wrote that together."
01:40:44;01:40:48;"Interesting. Okay. Or they both have writing credits. It also makes me think of course of"
01:40:48;01:40:55;"Jan Hammer, another European synth wizard who also had an instrumental hit in the eighties with his"
01:40:55;01:41:02;"theme from Miami Vice. But Jan Hammer's background was actually playing with like John McLaughlin"
01:41:02;01:41:07;"and these like shredder seventies fusion guys. So like, I wonder if Harold Foltermeyer like in"
01:41:07;01:41:12;"the sixties or seventies was also just like ever like played keys in some sort of like really heady"
01:41:12;01:41:19;"fusion group. Could easily picture that. The number three song back in 2020, we've heard"
01:41:19;01:41:24;"this one a lot, The Weekend Blinding Lights, which interestingly is a bit of an eighties homage."
01:41:25;01:41:29;"You know this song Aaron? Can't say that I do. I'm curious once this song kicks off,"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"what you think it's kind of referencing or what inspired it?"
01:41:32;01:41:51;"Already boys of summer. Okay. Oh yeah. Good call. Wait, this song is from now? Yeah. It's The"
01:41:51;01:41:58;"Weekend. He's getting into his eighties sense. He's remember there was an episode where this song"
01:41:58;01:42:05;"inspired us to go into this whole riff about, Oh, the ultimate pretty boy band. Yeah. The like"
01:42:05;01:42:12;"guys that are amazing looking, but also write great songs. Because Aaron, to me, Duran Duran."
01:42:12;01:42:18;"Yeah, exactly. Duran Duran is up there. And the other one who I think inspired this song is Aha."
01:42:18;01:42:28;"Even though this song is much younger, I still felt like, and the main guys in Aha are like"
01:42:28;01:42:33;"very good looking. And we basically talked about, look, you got your pretty boys. They were already"
01:42:33;01:42:38;"won the genetic lottery. And we're not just talking about handsome people or good looking"
01:42:38;01:42:45;"people. We're talking about true pretty boys. Just drop dead gorgeous, drop dead gorgeous model"
01:42:45;01:42:50;"level fellas. But then they got a set of pipes on them and they can sing. Okay. Fair enough."
01:42:50;01:42:56;"They won the genetic lottery twice, but they can also write monster pop hits. I mean, that's crazy."
01:42:56;01:43:04;"It's unfair. Duran Duran are the best examples because all the great looking fellas and Duran"
01:43:04;01:43:09;"Duran were also just like amazing musicians and that music so complicated and like, absolutely."
01:43:09;01:43:16;"Duran Duran is like, they're great songwriters. Those guys are great songs. Also, I want to throw"
01:43:16;01:43:22;"Japan, Japan in that mix. The band? Oh, yeah, the band Japan. They're like super pretty. And those"
01:43:22;01:43:29;"are like crazy songs. What's the guy's name? David? David Sylvian. Yeah. Where's he from?"
01:43:29;01:43:33;"They're British. They're British. Although he did some cool stuff that I used to have like,"
01:43:34;01:43:39;"deep mp3s. I downloaded off soul seeker stuff he did with the Ritchie Sakamoto. They had like,"
01:43:39;01:43:44;"yeah, some cool stuff. Absolutely. Back to 85. This is a pretty monster"
01:43:44;01:43:50;"set of songs. At number two, we got tears for fears. Everybody wants to rule the world."
01:43:57;01:44:04;"Hell yeah. Tears for fears is so good. Great song. Also like an iconic 80s shuffle."
01:44:23;01:44:29;"Such a good opening line. Welcome to your life. Yeah, just boom. Welcome to my life."
01:44:29;01:44:31;"Welcome to your life."
01:44:31;01:44:50;"Turn your back on Mother Nature. Human nature? No, Mother Nature. Yeah, I think it's turn your"
01:44:50;01:44:56;"back on Mother Nature. What is this song about? Is this an environmentalist song?"
01:44:56;01:45:08;"The original chorus of this song was everybody wants to go to war."
01:45:08;01:45:16;"Whoa, whoa. But one of the members of the groups thought that it was lackluster. Good call. Yeah,"
01:45:16;01:45:20;"also everybody wants to go to war just doesn't roll off the tongue in quite the same way."
01:45:20;01:45:26;"All right, great song. Let's go back to 2020. I was actually thinking about this song a little"
01:45:26;01:45:31;"bit when we're talking about Jersey Shore because people sometimes forget that Lady Gaga and Ariana"
01:45:31;01:45:36;"Grande teaming up is actually a pretty big deal for Italian Americans. We've talked on this show"
01:45:36;01:45:42;"about Ariana Grande is low key a Jersey girl, even though she grew up mostly in Florida. And Lady"
01:45:42;01:45:47;"Gaga, she's a New Yorker, but she's, you know, tri-state Italian. They're two tri-state Italians"
01:45:47;01:45:54;"together, which we haven't seen a pair of tri-state Italians get up in charts like this in a long time."
01:45:54;01:46:00;"We don't see that many tri-state Italians up in the top five on the charts, period. I mean,"
01:46:00;01:46:05;"obviously, you have a fake tri-state Italian Billy Joel, who did some damage to the charts in the"
01:46:05;01:46:11;"70s and 80s. But he's been quiet. He's been quiet for almost 30 years. I gotta shout out my friend,"
01:46:11;01:46:19;"Blood Pop, who's one of the producers on almost the entire album. And this is his work. So anyway,"
01:46:19;01:46:24;"a new hit from the forthcoming Lady Gaga album, Chromatica. Here's her collaboration with Ariana"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Grande, Rain On Me."
01:46:26;01:46:52;"I didn't ask for a free ride. I only asked you to show me a real good time. I never asked for the rainfall. At least I showed up, you showed me the thing. I don't need it. It's coming down on me. Water like misery. It's coming down on me."
01:46:52;01:47:04;"This album's being kind of seen as Gaga's return to her classic pop roots after her kind of, you know, her rootsy era."
01:47:04;01:47:14;"One funny thing about this song, I've already heard it. Jake, have you already heard it?"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"No, I've never heard it. Aaron?"
01:47:16;01:47:45;"No. Lady Gaga, she's always an artist that I've always kind of respected. So I'm interested in what she's up to. So I saw that, oh, wow, two tri-state area Italian women coming together on a single like Sign Me Up. And it's produced by my boy, Please. So I watched the video the day it came out. And I really thought about it. So in the video, there's a lot of water coming down, understandably, because the song's called Rain On Me. But we just heard the chorus, which I looked it up later."
01:47:45;01:48:14;"It's, ""I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive. Rain on me."" And I understood, okay, this is, I'm sure there's more to it. But at the very least, this is about embracing adversity and saying, you know what, there's a version of life that could be easier. I might even prefer to be dry. But going through this heaviness of getting rained on actually reminds me I'm alive. It's like a celebratory sentiment in a way. It's not sugar coated. And it's about coming through some sh*t. So that all makes sense."
01:48:14;01:48:28;"But I swear, I watched the entire video. And I really thought every time I heard the chorus, that she was saying, ""I'd rather be drunk, but at least I'm alive."" And I was like, ""Oh, sh*t."" This is like the giving up booze song."
01:48:28;01:48:28;"Whoa."
01:48:28;01:48:53;"And then I was listening to this whole song. ""I'd rather be drunk, but at least I'm alive."" And I was like, that's such an amazingly bold chorus. And I was like, you know, I know I'm so impressed by people who do 12-step stuff, because that's something that requires so much thought and examination and daily work and stuff."
01:48:53;01:49:15;"So I was like, whoa, this is like, just straight up a big kind of like, sober pop song. And also what I was impressed by was that she wasn't sugarcoating it. And she wasn't saying, ""Oh, yeah."" Because you know, sometimes you talk to different people who are like sober. And there's one school, sometimes you hear from people like, ""Oh, man, that was terrible. Those are the bad old days. I don't miss it at all. You know what I'm into? Exercise or this or that."""
01:49:15;01:49:41;"And then there's another type of person you talk to. It's the same thing could be about cigarettes or drugs or anything. And they say, ""I haven't drank in 20 years."" And be like, ""Oh, so like, what's that like?"" I think about drinking every single day. You know, like, if you've ever had somebody like that. And I'm sure everybody's different, but I'm very impressed by people like that, because they're keeping it real. They're like, it's not easy. So anyway, I thought that was that kind of song where she's like, ""I'd rather be drunk, but at least I'm alive."""
01:49:41;01:49:43;"Wait, what is the actual lyric?"
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Can you back it up and play the chorus again? ""I'd rather be dry."""
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Oh, oh, ""rain,"" I see."
01:49:48;01:49:52;"I'd prefer if it wasn't raining on me, but you know, let's hear that chorus."
01:49:52;01:49:56;"""I'd rather be drunk, but at least I'm alive."""
01:49:56;01:49:58;"No, it does sound like drunk."
01:49:58;01:49:58;"Yeah."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"""Rain on me, rain, rain."""
01:50:00;01:50:02;"""I'd rather be drunk, but at least I'm alive."""
01:50:02;01:50:10;"Yeah, wait. Maybe she is saying drunk. Maybe I'm right. I looked it up. Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch. What are you seeing on the lyrics websites?"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"It is ""I'd rather be dry."""
01:50:13;01:50:14;"Not drunk."
01:50:14;01:50:24;"Maybe they just don't want people to know what the song's really about. Maybe it's like a nod to all the other sober people struggling out there. And she's like, ""That's just for us."""
01:50:24;01:50:30;"It's a little bit Starbucks lovers. Like you can't unhear it once you hear it that way."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"What's Starbucks lovers?"
01:50:32;01:50:33;"Taylor Swift."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Taylor Swift, Blank Space. You know that song?"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"No."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"""And I go to the..."""
01:50:38;01:50:39;"Oh, I do know that song."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"""Starbucks, Starbucks."" Wait, how does it go?"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"I gotta do it backwards."
01:50:45;01:50:49;"""Cause I got a blank space, baby. Nah, not your name."""
01:50:49;01:51:05;"There's a funny article that came out recently, like five days ago, that says Lady Gaga flirted with the idea of going sober while making this album."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Oh."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"Flirted."
01:51:09;01:51:13;"""Suit and tie, I can read you like a magazine."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Made in funny rumors fly."
01:51:15;01:51:20;"And I know you heard about me, so hey, let's be friends."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"I'm dying to see how this one ends."""
01:51:22;01:51:24;"This is a beautiful song."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"""And my hand..."""
01:51:26;01:51:28;"Beautiful!"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"""So it's gonna be forever,"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"or it's gonna go down in flames."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"You can tell me when it's over,"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"if the high was worth the pain."""
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Here it comes, here it comes."
01:51:38;01:51:40;"""Got a long list of ex-lovers."""
01:51:40;01:51:42;"Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"There's no question."
01:51:44;01:51:46;"Except when you work backwards, it's not a complete sentence."
01:51:46;01:51:48;"It sounds like you're saying, ""Got a long list,"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"Starbucks lovers."""
01:51:50;01:51:52;"I guess that could be, that could be like a GBV lyric."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"""I've got a long list,"
01:51:54;01:51:56;"Starbucks lovers."""
01:51:56;01:51:58;"Really just a beautiful song."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"Okay, the number one song this week in '85."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"'85 is killing it."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"Very strong."
01:52:04;01:52:06;"Is ""Wham!"""
01:52:06;01:52:08;"I've waxed poetic about George Michael"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"before, because by the way,"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"George Michael, he wasn't in a band,"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"but he's the ultimate pretty boy."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"Yes. Drop Dead Gorgeous Man"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"wrote his own songs"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"for his solo stuff, and ""Wham!"" and produced"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"them by himself. His first"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"solo album, the fact that he just made it"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"himself, and he's that handsome."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"Coming in at number one"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"on the Time Crisis list of"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"80s pretty boys. Yeah, he's"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"the ultimate triple threat."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"This song is good."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Yes, so good. I love this song."
01:52:38;01:52:44;"I can also imagine that for a lot"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"of people, ""Wham!"" was seen as very"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"lightweight in the beginning, especially"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"because like, I think the"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"big single before this was, ""Wake me"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"up before you go go."" Kind of corny."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"Like, I could just totally picture"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"somebody hearing this song and being like,"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"""Wait, who is this?"" And be like, ""This is Wham?"""
01:53:00;01:53:02;"And just kind of starting to realize with this song"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"that there's something under the hood."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"Just like, ""Wait, somebody's"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"really smart in this organization."""
01:53:08;01:53:16;"Just such a naturally chill, bouncy"

01:53:36;01:53:38;"Man, what a banger."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"Wait, oh, this song was mentioned in a landmark"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"1998 sampling"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"copyright decision"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"where they concluded that NC Hammer"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"had sampled music by"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"another group, and that group"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"had sampled this song but not disclosed it."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"Oh, so NC Hammer got kind of screwed"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"there. Also,"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"one thing I'll say is"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"anybody who's a big music"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"nerd or spent a lot of time on the internet in the past"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"five to ten years is probably aware of"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"the renewed Western interest"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"in the"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"late 70s, or really 80s"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"genre of Japanese music"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"called ""City Pop."" Like, ""Light in the Attic"""
01:54:14;01:54:16;"puts out these great compilations,"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"and there's so much cool stuff. And sometimes I'll get"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"on a YouTube rabbit hole that's like"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"a lot of really incredible music,"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"but there is... It's funny. There's some..."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"I don't know if it's because I've listened to too much"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"like ""City Pop"" and like"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"80s Japanese music and like"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"""Vaporwave"" that samples that stuff,"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"but I can't help but feel like"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"""Everything She Wants"" by Wham! sounds like"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Japanese to me now. Realistically,"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"I'm probably reacting to the fact that"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"there's probably some Japanese music"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"made by people who like were into this"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"song and the stuff it was referencing."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"But do you guys feel me at all that it kind of sounds"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Japanese? Yeah."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"I hear it's got a little"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"bit of that ""City Pop"" vibe."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"Aaron, who is the older Japanese"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"gentleman that guest-vocaled"

01:55:02;01:55:04;"Yukihiro Takahashi sings a song."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"He was the drummer and singer"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"in Yellow Magic Orchestra. Sick. Oh!"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"So, with Ritchie Sakamoto"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"and Hiromi Hosono."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Yeah. Yeah, real super... You know what's funny?"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"I was just kind of baked the other night"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"and I wanted to watch some live music"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"on YouTube and I was just like clicking around"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"and I ended up throwing on"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"Yellow Magic Orchestra live"
01:55:24;01:55:26;"at the Greek Theater."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"One question that I couldn't figure out was"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"were they opening for somebody?"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"Because it says it was like night two."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"Did Yellow Magic Orchestra pack out the Greek"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Theater in the 80s for two nights?"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"Is there a story there? I feel like they were"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"opening for like"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"a kind of punkish band."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"I can't remember what it was,"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"but I remember being surprised by"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"the bill. Maybe like a radio"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"station put it together or something."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"It was 1979."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"They're playing the Greek Theater with the Tubes."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"I don't know much about the Tubes."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"Are they like an LA punk band?"
01:55:58;01:56:00;"That's a bit of a blind spot for me."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"I'll check them out though. Interesting"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"bill. The number one song"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"right now, 2020,"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"is DaBaby,"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"featuring Roddy Ricch."
01:56:10;01:56:12;"I think we did hear the song last time. It's Rockstar."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"We were a little bit disappointed that"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"we finally get a rock song"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"at number one, and it's got more of like"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"an acoustic Spanish guitar vibe."
01:56:20;01:56:22;"Right."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"But DaBaby's really good."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"The Tubes were from San Francisco."
01:56:26;01:56:28;"Oh dude, you know who was in the Tubes?"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"Who? Vince Wellnick."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Oh! Right!"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"Grateful Dead connection."
01:56:34;01:56:36;"Always."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"I like that they're"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"talking about a Lamborghini."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"Very 80s."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"Lamborghinis."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Have you ever been in a Lamborghini?"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Um..."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"I like you have to think about it."
01:56:50;01:56:52;"I have a vague memory of once"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"getting a ride in a sports car."
01:56:54;01:56:56;"Like a really fancy sports car."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"And my first thought being like,"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"""This is insane how low to the ground it is."
01:57:00;01:57:02;"This is not luxurious. It's not cool."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"This is uncomfortable to enter."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"I don't feel special riding in this car."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"I feel like a loser."""
01:57:08;01:57:10;"So I remember whatever car that was could have been a Lamborghini."
01:57:10;01:57:12;"I was like, ""This is Lamb..."""
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Jake, what's the most baller car that you've ever driven?"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"Um..."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"Maybe like a nice"
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Tesla or something."
01:57:20;01:57:22;"But I know you mean, I have been in some sports cars"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"that are like super low to the ground,"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"and you're just sort of like, this is the most bottom out"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"on like driveways"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"and like speed bumps, like constantly."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Yeah, it just makes me think of like"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"Wolf of Wall Street."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Just like this kind of like..."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"Just like a dude riding this low to the ground car"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"that just gets f***ed up."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"Instantly."
01:57:42;01:57:44;"I'm not trying to be too much of a hater,"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"because if people are taking the design angle"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"or like, I know that a lot of people"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"are into those kind of cars are like really,"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"they actually care about"
01:57:52;01:57:54;"the technical stuff."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"And like, I get it."
01:57:56;01:57:58;"I mean, I don't get it, but I can imagine"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"what it's like to be like, like if you said this thing"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"about being low to the ground, some people might be like,"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"""Uh, yeah, it's not the most comfortable thing"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"in the world to get into."" That's because this is a sports car,"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"my friend."
01:58:08;01:58:10;"You have a totally different value system."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"What I'm interested in is the center of gravity"
01:58:12;01:58:14;"and the, you know, V8,"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"whatever, all the s*** that I know nothing about."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"I know like people who are into"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"like vintage cars, so like I've"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"know people who are like"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"always talking about Porsche 911s."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"[laughter]"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"The 70s or like the 90s?"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"Yeah, I know"
01:58:30;01:58:32;"some people who are really into the 60s and 70s"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"ones. I have a friend"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"who has like a vintage Porsche"
01:58:36;01:58:38;"and one time we were driving around"
01:58:38;01:58:40;"and we were"
01:58:40;01:58:42;"getting into the car in front of a coffee shop"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"or something and a guy pulled up next to us and was like,"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"""Oh, okay, like"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"72? Oh, actually 71."
01:58:48;01:58:50;"Oh!"" You know, this whole conversation."
01:58:50;01:58:52;"And then my friend said to me like,"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"""Maybe it was the first time we'd gone out together in that car."""
01:58:54;01:58:56;"And he said, ""You'll see, this car's a total dude"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"magnet."" And then as we drove around"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"the rest of the day, there were so many"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"times that dudes would like pull up at stoplights"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"and be like, ""Okay!"" Like thumbs-ups"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"and like,"
01:59:06;01:59:08;"it's a total dude magnet."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"But anyway, I feel like"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"I'm so ignorant about car stuff. There's like"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"once or twice where I felt like I had"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"to make stereotypically"
01:59:16;01:59:18;"masculine conversation with somebody."
01:59:18;01:59:20;"There's literally one time where"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"I actually felt like my ability to"
01:59:22;01:59:24;"identify a Porsche 911,"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"it wasn't like a tense situation,"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"but just like, you know, I always feel"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"like at a disadvantage, like I can't talk"
01:59:30;01:59:32;"sports that well or stuff. And like sometimes you're just"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"like with a dude who just like"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"doesn't care about"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"the Grateful Dead or Chunky Dunkeys or anything"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"like that. He's into cars and sports."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"You know, sports, maybe I could be"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"like, ""Hey, you see the last dance?"" But"
01:59:44;01:59:46;"there's one time, I'm not gonna go into details, but it was"
01:59:46;01:59:48;"just like where I just had this interaction"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"where I was like, ""Is that a 911?"""
01:59:50;01:59:52;"Which probably is already kind of basic."
01:59:52;01:59:54;"No, no, I didn't say that because saying it's a 911"
01:59:54;01:59:56;"is too stupid. That would literally"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"be going up to a guy with a guitar and be like,"
01:59:58;02:00:00;"""Is that a Fender?"" Just like, ""Says Fender."""
02:00:00;02:00:02;"And the guy's like, ""Uh, yeah."""
02:00:02;02:00:04;"You know, I didn't say it was a 911,"
02:00:04;02:00:06;"but I said, ""What year is that?"" And because"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"I knew that my friend had one from a certain"
02:00:08;02:00:10;"year, I'd heard some conversation about"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"when the design changed. I was like,"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"""Is that late 80s?"" And the guy's like,"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"""89."" And I was like, ""Yeah, that's what I thought."""
02:00:16;02:00:18;"And he was like, ""I don't know."" And I just felt like, ""Alright."""
02:00:18;02:00:20;"But then you're on thin ice because you've"
02:00:20;02:00:22;"started the conversation, but you know nothing more."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"Right."
02:00:24;02:00:26;"The end of it. You're totally tapped out."
02:00:26;02:00:28;"He's ready to start talking with you about it."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"""Yeah, it's an '89."" And you're like,"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"""I'm thinking I literally don't even"
02:00:32;02:00:34;"know what V8 means. Do you guys know what V8 means?"""
02:00:34;02:00:36;"It's eight cylinders. It's the tomato juice."
02:00:36;02:00:38;"Eight cylinders"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"pumping in the engine? Yeah, eight cylinder"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"engine. Like a Honda Civic"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"is like a four cylinder."
02:00:44;02:00:46;"Wait, but what does the V stand for?"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"A valve, I guess, probably?"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"Could you identify a Porsche 911"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"from 50 yards? No, I don't"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"know anything about maker"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"models, but for some reason I do"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"know about the basics of the number"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"of pistons in an engine."
02:01:00;02:01:02;"Guys. There's crazy"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"powerful pickup trucks that are"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"like V12 or something."
02:01:06;02:01:08;"Oh, because they really get the pull."
02:01:08;02:01:10;"Like an F350. Don't quote me on this."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"I could be wrong on this, but a big Ford"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"F350, I'm going to"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"guess that's like a V10."
02:01:16;02:01:18;"I don't think"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"there's a V10. Like a V12."
02:01:20;02:01:22;"Guys, the V doesn't stand for"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"anything, by the way."
02:01:24;02:01:26;"The V refers"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"to the formation of the engine."
02:01:28;02:01:30;"The shape of the engine looks like"
02:01:30;02:01:32;"a V. Seinfeld, could you just do a quick"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"number crunch on the number of pistons"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"on the Ford F350?"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"Sure. Wait, so Seinfeld,"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"are you a car guy? Did you know that"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"I pulled it out."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"Yeah, no, I did a number crunch."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"Check this out. I'm not a car guy,"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"but I know this tidbit that'll help you guys"
02:01:48;02:01:50;"out in male situations."
02:01:50;02:01:52;"There's an"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"alternative to a V, and"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"it's called a slant. So there's"
02:01:56;02:01:58;"like a slant six. It's"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"just slanted one way instead of being shaped like"
02:02:00;02:02:02;"a V, and so you don't call it a V6"
02:02:02;02:02:04;"or whatever. And I didn't look that up."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"I only know that because I had to buy a van at one point."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"So you're kind of, you're low-key a car guy."
02:02:08;02:02:10;"You're a van guy."
02:02:10;02:02:12;"I love"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"the idea of trying to, of getting really"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"into something specific about cars,"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"and then next time you want to talk with a guy"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"who's just like a general car enthusiast who"
02:02:20;02:02:22;"wants to talk about the classics, but being like,"
02:02:22;02:02:24;"""Hey, ask me anything"
02:02:24;02:02:26;"about the 1989 Mercury"
02:02:26;02:02:28;"Sable."" And the guy's like,"
02:02:28;02:02:30;"""I don't care about that."" Be like, ""No, I'm a"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"car guy too, but I know everything about it."""
02:02:32;02:02:34;"And then just like giving him useless facts. It'd be"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"kind of like trying to have like a guy talk"
02:02:36;02:02:38;"about sports to like somebody just like"
02:02:38;02:02:40;"you know, classic football, basketball,"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"baseball, and then"
02:02:42;02:02:44;"I don't know, like obsessively talking"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"about like Aussie rules"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"football."
02:02:48;02:02:50;"That's"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"the type of thing. It's like the American dude"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"who's just like really into international sports."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"Oh yeah. I love that guy."
02:02:56;02:02:58;"Soccer doesn't count because soccer is kind of like so"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"broadly popular now. Rugby. Just to be like"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"Yeah, be like, ""I follow."""
02:03:02;02:03:04;"You know what's very rare?"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"Basically doesn't exist. To be an American guy"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"and your family is"
02:03:08;02:03:10;"American. Like you're multi-generational"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"American. Your family is not from"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"the UK or Australia or India or Pakistan"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"or something. And to just be obsessed with"
02:03:16;02:03:18;"cricket. Be like, ""How'd you get in?"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"Your parents? Watch it?"" Oh God, no."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"Be like, ""You know,"
02:03:22;02:03:24;"I was 11 years old. I was"
02:03:24;02:03:26;"flipping through channels out of my grandma's house."
02:03:26;02:03:28;"I caught a little bit of"
02:03:28;02:03:30;"Hour 4 of"
02:03:30;02:03:32;"England versus"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"South Africa, whatever,"
02:03:34;02:03:36;"'97 and I was"
02:03:36;02:03:38;"hooked."" Because people always used to"
02:03:38;02:03:40;"joke, ""Oh, Americans don't like"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"soccer."" I know so many dudes who have"
02:03:42;02:03:44;"a team."
02:03:44;02:03:46;"It's not weird at all. American"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"people are"
02:03:48;02:03:50;"interested in soccer and be like, ""Oh yeah."
02:03:50;02:03:52;"Oh look. How's Tottenham doing?"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"How's whatever?"" But I will say that"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"I've never met the cricket"
02:03:56;02:03:58;"equivalent. Maybe it's got to be us."
02:03:58;02:04:00;"Cricket talk."
02:04:00;02:04:02;"Those are long games. I read a book about cricket"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"by C.L.R. James."
02:04:04;02:04:06;"That's cool. It's about the West"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"Indian team that kind of"
02:04:08;02:04:10;"swept the world."
02:04:10;02:04:12;"They had people from all"
02:04:12;02:04:14;"the West Indian countries together"
02:04:14;02:04:16;"and there was a team, I think, in the '60s"
02:04:16;02:04:18;"that just"
02:04:18;02:04:20;"kicked everybody's asses and invented"
02:04:20;02:04:22;"a new style called fast"
02:04:22;02:04:24;"bowling. And it was an interesting story because"
02:04:24;02:04:26;"it's about race and"
02:04:26;02:04:28;"imperialism and culture and stuff as well"
02:04:28;02:04:30;"because obviously you can imagine that was a"
02:04:30;02:04:32;"big deal for the West Indian team to come back"
02:04:32;02:04:34;"and beat England."
02:04:34;02:04:36;"The place where the sport was invented."
02:04:36;02:04:38;"It's a very interesting book."
02:04:38;02:04:40;"He's a famous writer who writes about"
02:04:40;02:04:42;"or he wrote about stuff"
02:04:42;02:04:44;"outside of cricket. Can I just wrap up"
02:04:44;02:04:46;"the car talk a little bit?"
02:04:46;02:04:48;"The F350 is a V8 engine."
02:04:48;02:04:50;"And I'm looking at the"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"V12 engine and I think that's"
02:04:52;02:04:54;"like when you get above eight cylinders"
02:04:54;02:04:56;"I think you start to get into high-powered"
02:04:56;02:04:58;"sports cars like we were talking about earlier."
02:04:58;02:05:00;"Like Porsches and stuff."
02:05:00;02:05:02;"I just did my own number crunch and I searched"
02:05:02;02:05:04;"V32 engine. Jesus."
02:05:04;02:05:06;"It looks kind of"
02:05:06;02:05:08;"almost like a gag or something."
02:05:08;02:05:10;"Right."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"I love to think about people that know anything about"
02:05:12;02:05:14;"cars listening to this idiotic part of the show."
02:05:14;02:05:16;"Just being like, ""Oh my god."""
02:05:16;02:05:18;"Also, the top five ended like ten"
02:05:18;02:05:20;"minutes ago."
02:05:20;02:05:22;"They're just screaming right now."
02:05:22;02:05:24;"They're just screaming at their phone."
02:05:24;02:05:26;"This episode was a real treat"
02:05:26;02:05:28;"because sometimes we end right after"
02:05:28;02:05:30;"the top five, but this time we got"
02:05:30;02:05:32;"an extra special ten minutes for all our car"
02:05:32;02:05:34;"enthusiasts out there."
02:05:34;02:05:36;"You're welcome, everybody."
02:05:36;02:05:38;"Well, Aaron, thanks so much for coming on the show."
02:05:38;02:05:40;"Thanks for having me."
02:05:40;02:05:42;"Thank you to our other"
02:05:42;02:05:44;"guest, Jonah Hill, who hopefully will be coming on"
02:05:44;02:05:46;"real soon again."
02:05:46;02:05:48;"And Brendan Dunn, who was"
02:05:48;02:05:50;"very informative about Chunky Dunkeys and"
02:05:50;02:05:52;"the SB Dunks. We'll see you next time."
02:05:52;02:05:54;"Time Crisis"
02:05:54;02:05:56;"with Ezra Koenig."
