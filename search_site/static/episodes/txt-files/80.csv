00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back again. Today Jake and I are joined in the studio by two very"
00:06;00:11;"special guests. Hannah Fidel, director of The Long Dumb Road, and Jason Manzoukas,"
00:11;00:16;"star of The Long Dumb Road. We'll also listen to the greatest hits of 1985 and"
00:16;00:24;"2018. Plus, talk about the Acebo. What is the Acebo? You already know. Figure it out."
00:24;00:37;"And if you don't know, you'll find out real soon. Because this is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Beats 1.1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Leave it on me babe"
01:20;01:29;"Alright, Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake? Hey. This time it's not just the two of us. When was the last time we had, I guess we have in-studio guests fairly frequently?"
01:29;01:37;"Kazzy David. Okay, yeah, that was a month or two ago. Yeah, not very frequently. A lot of Collins. A lot of Collins."
01:37;01:45;"But today we actually have some human beings in the studio because this is a special episode about The Long Dumb Road and we're here with director Hannah Fidel."
01:45;01:53;"Fidel. Fidel. Okay. Hannah Fidel. Jake just learned this like six months ago. I really thought- Not true."
01:53;02:07;"Hannah Fidel. Wait, say it again. Fidel. So it's not Fidel. No, that's it. It's Fidel? Yeah. Not Fidel? It should be spelled F-I-E-D-E-L-L."
02:07;02:19;"Hannah Fidel. Jake Longstreath. Jonathan. It's not Jonathan. Wait, wait, your birth name is just John? Yeah. It's not Jonathan? No. What? J-O-H-N."
02:19;02:27;"J-O-H-N is a different name than Jonathan? Yeah, I think so. Because you don't spell Jonathan with an H. Okay. This is good stuff."
02:27;02:35;"Really off to the races and rounding it out is the star of The Long Dumb Road, Jason Manzoukas. By the way, nailed it. How was that? Flawless."
02:35;02:43;"Absolutely flawless. That was impressive, actually. Now, growing up, Jason, did people get your name wrong a lot or is it actually easier?"
02:43;02:57;"All the time. Anytime growing up, anytime anybody read my name, it was always, ""Man, Koukousis, Mansa. There's just too many concurrent consonants in the name to effortlessly get it."""
02:57;03:05;"I've had the experience, and my first name is less complicated than your last name, Jason, but now I think kind of most people know it. It's become a more popular baby name."
03:05;03:14;"I also have memories of growing up and being in some situations where somebody would look at my name, E-Z-R-A, and I don't even think this is on any kind of cultural sh*t."
03:14;03:25;"I think it's just people who don't feel confident in their spelling or their reading abilities, and as soon as they would see that, even just with four letters, they would go, ""Oh my God. I'm not going to get this one."""
03:25;03:31;"What? Easy rock. It's a thing. A lot of people would often read it as Urza. Yeah, I could see that."
03:31;03:44;"I can almost imagine that as simple as it seems, E-Z-R-A, I literally can only think of one way to pronounce it, Ezra, but I think some people, maybe their eyes go straight to the Z-R, and they're just already like, ""Okay, I'm out."""
03:44;03:49;"Those don't go together. I'm out. So looking at your last name. T-Z. Yeah, it's the T-Z right in the middle."
03:49;03:53;"The T-Z is a real problem for people. It really hangs people up."
03:53;04:01;"Because maybe they're starting to sound it out, like, kind of grade school style, and they're just like, ""Jason Mant, Mantzuacus."""
04:01;04:05;"Yeah, exactly. Oh, then you got the O-U. Yeah, but you got a lot of Mantzuacus."
04:05;04:18;"Yeah, there's a lot of that. There's a lot of exactly what you just did, watching people try to work it out, and then there was a lot of people who'd be like, ""Jason Mant, Jason M? Is Jason M here?"""
04:18;04:24;"So, Long Dumb Road. We talked about it once or twice on the show. It's come up. I think TC heads know that it's coming."
04:24;04:30;"Yeah. So this is the movie that Hannah directed Jason Starz in. Did you do anything on it, Jay? You do a little music?"
04:30;04:36;"Yeah, some rough score stuff. Dick pics, aka Richard Pictures, much to the consternation of Mantzuacus."
04:36;04:40;"I have real thoughts on this. Wait, wait, wait. We can get into it in a second. Real thoughts on this."
04:40;04:46;"We made up some rough score ideas, which ended up getting used. By the way, it's out November 9th."
04:46;04:49;"Why do you keep saying rough scoring? You're just being humble?"
04:49;04:53;"Yeah, he's being humble. The songs that he recorded, we used."
04:53;04:55;"So you did some scoring for the film?"
04:55;04:58;"To be fair, those songs are rough."
04:58;04:59;"Okay."
04:59;05:00;"Yeah, it's rough stuff, folks."
05:00;05:02;"It's a bit of a rough listen."
05:02;05:07;"Yeah, just when you keep saying rough, it keeps implying that then we handed it to the composer, who took some of the themes."
05:07;05:09;"That also happened."
05:09;05:10;"Okay."
05:10;05:14;"Being a little modest, they were also designed to be demos."
05:14;05:17;"And then sometimes the demo is better than the album."
05:17;05:18;"You guys did it as temp score."
05:18;05:19;"Right."
05:19;05:22;"And then we realized it was really good."
05:22;05:23;"That's cool."
05:23;05:24;"Real peak behind the scenes here."
05:24;05:25;"Keep something vibing."
05:54;05:58;"So you guys just premiered the movie at South by Southwest?"
05:58;06:01;"No, we premiered it at Sundance."
06:01;06:03;"But you were in Austin."
06:03;06:04;"In Austin, yes."
06:04;06:06;"At the Austin Film Festival."
06:06;06:08;"Is it even South by Southwest time of year?"
06:08;06:09;"It is not."
06:09;06:10;"Oh yeah, that's like in March."
06:10;06:11;"Come on, man. You know that."
06:11;06:12;"Correct."
06:12;06:16;"I saw that you guys were doing movie stuff in Austin, and I made an assumption."
06:16;06:18;"I think that's totally appropriate."
06:18;06:21;"And in Austin, did you guys go to Pluckers?"
06:21;06:22;"No."
06:22;06:23;"I didn't."
06:23;06:24;"Oh, I didn't."
06:24;06:25;"Did you guys?"
06:25;06:26;"We did not."
06:26;06:27;"No."
06:27;06:28;"What's Pluckers?"
06:28;06:29;"Pluckers?"
06:29;06:32;"It's either a food establishment or like a bluegrass club."
06:32;06:34;"It's food establishment."
06:34;06:36;"What do you think the vibe of Pluckers is?"
06:36;06:37;"It's based in Austin."
06:37;06:40;"I'm going to say it's like a--I'm going to guess a chicken joint of some sort."
06:40;06:42;"There's so many types of chicken, though."
06:42;06:46;"Oh, probably just a clean grilled chicken breast."
06:46;06:47;"[laughs]"
06:47;06:52;"Like something very lightly seasoned with like a little bit of olive oil and some thyme."
06:52;06:53;"I'm guessing."
06:53;06:56;"Like something that's three Weight Watchers points."
06:56;07:00;"Well, Austin should clarify that Pluckers is a chain of about 30 restaurants in Texas."
07:00;07:02;"Okay, then I'm doubling down."
07:02;07:09;"It's just lightly--and maybe there's just like a little bit of an arugula salad on the side."
07:09;07:10;"That's my guess."
07:10;07:13;"Are you ready to get plucked at Pluckers?"
07:13;07:19;"I'll have one lightly salted chicken breast with some thyme, some oregano,"
07:19;07:22;"something that is very locale."
07:22;07:26;"This is actually a pretty good idea because when you talk about chicken restaurants,"
07:26;07:31;"you're thinking of barbecue chicken, fried chicken, or what Pluckers actually is, wangs, buffalo wangs."
07:31;07:33;"Chicken [bleep]"
07:33;07:34;"Yeah, exactly."
07:34;07:35;"Oh."
07:35;07:36;"You also go watch the game there."
07:36;07:37;"Oh, cool."
07:37;07:38;"So it's a game spot?"
07:38;07:39;"Yeah, you watch the game."
07:39;07:40;"Is it a game spot?"
07:40;07:42;"Is it inside of a game spot where they sell video games?"
07:42;07:45;"It might occasionally be next to one in a strip mall."
07:45;07:46;"Oh, Pluckers is a strip mall?"
07:46;07:49;"Wait a minute, is Pluckers a local Austin only?"
07:49;07:53;"Are you asking did we go to the Pluckers in Austin, but if we had been in Cincinnati,"
07:53;07:55;"would you have also said, ""Hey, did you go to Pluckers?"""
07:55;07:56;"Houston, San Antonio."
07:56;07:58;"Pluckers is an Austin-based--"
07:58;07:59;"Texas."
07:59;08:01;"Texas/Oklahoma."
08:01;08:02;"I think Louisiana."
08:02;08:07;"And Louisiana buffalo wangs chain, and I believe in Austin there's probably a few."
08:07;08:08;"Got it."
08:08;08:11;"I thought I saw on Instagram that you guys went to Pluckers or something."
08:11;08:12;"Are you just shouting out Pluckers?"
08:12;08:17;"I listened to the episode where you talk to the dude who does all the social media."
08:17;08:18;"The social media guy, yeah."
08:18;08:22;"You have a relationship with the Pluckers social media guy?"
08:22;08:23;"Yes, he was our--"
08:23;08:25;"We were on the phone with him for 40 minutes."
08:25;08:26;"He was our guest on the last show."
08:26;08:28;"I have to say one of your best guests."
08:28;08:29;"He was interesting."
08:29;08:34;"He was real mask off with us because we always talk about corporate food Twitter and how"
08:34;08:38;"much it offends us, but he got on here and he was like, ""Listen, I'm creating buffalo"
08:38;08:42;"wang memes, I'm picking fights with buffalo wild wings on Twitter."
08:42;08:44;"I used to be a journalist."
08:44;08:46;"Now I run social media for Pluckers."""
08:46;08:48;"And this is the world we-- what did he keep saying?"
08:48;08:50;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:50;08:51;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:51;08:52;"Wow."
08:52;08:53;"Which is a good time with the film."
08:53;08:54;"Wow."
08:54;08:55;"It's a dumb time to be alive."
08:55;08:57;"He is the social media coordinator for Pluckers."
08:57;08:58;"Yeah."
08:58;08:59;"Former journalist."
08:59;09:02;"That right there is heartbreak for journalists everywhere."
09:02;09:03;"Yeah."
09:03;09:04;"No, but he even said something--"
09:04;09:05;"That sums it up."
09:05;09:06;"He even said something on the last episode."
09:06;09:08;"It was really raw the way he put it."
09:08;09:13;"He said something like, ""I mean, you could spend weeks researching an article about racism"
09:13;09:15;"at UT, nobody's going to read it."""
09:15;09:19;"Or you can make a crying Jordan buffalo wang, get a thousand retweets."
09:19;09:20;"He said something like that."
09:20;09:21;"Yeah."
09:21;09:22;"Yeah, so he was real mask off."
09:22;09:24;"He was letting us behind the scenes and we appreciate that."
09:24;09:26;"Traditionally, is he a mask on kind of guy though?"
09:26;09:27;"Well, I guess--"
09:27;09:29;"Is he in Slipknot?"
09:29;09:31;"That's my question."
09:31;09:32;"Second career."
09:32;09:39;"He's like, ""I was a rhythm guitarist in Slipknot, journalist, and now I run social media for Pluckers."""
09:39;09:42;"I could imagine myself following that career trajectory myself."
09:42;09:43;"Yeah."
09:43;09:49;"I would love it if you were revealed to have been one of the members of Slipknot this whole time, just under a mask."
09:49;09:50;"That's actually a good--"
09:50;09:51;"Wow."
09:51;09:56;"When the next Vampire Weekend album comes out and people are asking what I've been doing for five and a half years,"
09:56;09:57;"I say, ""I've been out there playing music."""
09:57;09:58;"Yeah, exactly."
09:58;09:59;"Been touring with my band."
09:59;10:00;"Yeah."
10:00;10:02;"Oh, wait, but Vampire Weekend hasn't been on tour."
10:02;10:05;"Oh, I'm in my primary band, Slipknot."
10:05;10:07;"Oh, you're in-- Oh, wow."
10:07;10:08;"Oh, yeah, Vampire Weekend's a side project."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:10;10:12;"I heard Ezra plays in Slipknot."
10:12;10:14;"No, I think it's Gwar."
10:14;10:18;"I think he might be one of those big giants in Gwar."
10:18;10:19;"Mask on."
10:38;10:39;"Give it to three."
11:08;11:10;"And the movie's about to be out nationwide?"
11:10;11:11;"Yeah."
11:11;11:12;"November what?"
11:12;11:13;"16th?"
11:13;11:15;"November 9th in New York."
11:15;11:16;"November 9th."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah."
11:17;11:19;"And then November 16th everywhere else."
11:19;11:24;"So if you are in New York on November 9th, go to the goddamn theater and see this goddamn movie."
11:24;11:25;"That's right."
11:25;11:27;"Or I swear to God, I will punch you in the face."
11:27;11:29;"You heard it here first, folks."
11:29;11:30;"Yep."
11:30;11:31;"Kaboom."
11:31;11:33;"Do you guys want to explain-- Because we've referenced the movie--"
11:33;11:34;"I'd love to perform a scene from it."
11:34;11:35;"But we've never--"
11:35;11:36;"[laughter]"
11:36;11:40;"How come-- You know what's hilarious?"
11:40;11:45;"It's like when you're in a band, almost everything you get asked to do is like come to the radio station--"
11:45;11:46;"Yeah, play a song."
11:46;11:47;"--and do a version of the song."
11:47;11:49;"How come they don't ask actors to perform--"
11:49;11:52;"By the way, I would love to perform a scene from the movie."
11:52;11:57;"So before you explain what the movie's about live, here's Jason."
11:57;11:58;"Give us a taste of the movie."
11:58;12:00;"We're not going to go to a clip."
12:00;12:01;"We've got somebody, an actor live in the studio."
12:01;12:02;"Okay."
12:02;12:03;"Okay, here we go."
12:03;12:08;"I'm going to pretend, if you will, that I'm in a car, a minivan with Tony Revolori."
12:08;12:10;"Hey, man, you party?"
12:10;12:12;"Uh, yeah."
12:12;12:14;"Oh, funny, yeah."
12:14;12:16;"Yeah, I know, me too."
12:16;12:18;"Oh, yeah, you want to help me spark this up?"
12:18;12:20;"Uh-huh."
12:20;12:21;"Yeah."
12:21;12:22;"Oh, sure, I want to hear about it."
12:22;12:23;"Go ahead."
12:23;12:24;"Long story?"
12:24;12:25;"I don't mind."
12:25;12:26;"I have time."
12:26;12:27;"Yeah, start it up."
12:27;12:28;"Mm-hmm."
12:28;12:29;"Yep."
12:29;12:30;"Sure."
12:30;12:33;"Uh, I think it's short for Catherine."
12:33;12:34;"Uh-huh."
12:35;12:39;"You mind if I put something-- oh, yep."
12:39;12:40;"Okay."
12:40;12:42;"Yeah, no, take it."
12:42;12:43;"No, it's your mom."
12:43;12:44;"You should take it."
12:44;12:45;"Uh-huh."
12:45;12:46;"Uh, okay."
12:46;12:47;"Huh?"
12:47;12:48;"Oh, yeah, no."
12:48;12:50;"Yeah, I know, I wasn't listening."
12:50;12:53;"Yeah, sounds like your mom's a real trip."
12:53;12:54;"Uh-huh."
12:54;12:55;"Cool."
12:55;12:56;"Crying?"
12:56;12:57;"Why?"
12:57;12:58;"Oh, 'cause-- oh, 'cause you're her only child."
12:58;12:59;"So, oh, she's upset, I guess."
12:59;13:00;"Wow, okay."
13:00;13:01;"Yeah."
13:01;13:02;"You want to put some music on?"
13:02;13:03;"Yeah."
13:03;13:04;"Great, let's do it."
13:04;13:05;"What do you think?"
13:05;13:06;"Uh, Aerosmith?"
13:06;13:07;"Oh, no."
13:07;13:08;"Probably, uh, Slipknot?"
13:08;13:11;"Yeah, we should probably play some Slipknot."
13:11;13:13;"That's a little bit of ""Long Dumb Road"" right there."
13:13;13:14;"Very nice."
13:14;13:16;"I mean, like, that is almost word for word."
13:16;13:19;"I mean, obviously, it makes a lot more sense when Tony--"
13:19;13:20;"when you get Tony's lines."
13:20;13:22;"That's one of the scenes I have the least lines in."
13:22;13:23;"Mm-hmm."
13:23;13:24;"That's a very heavy Tony scene."
13:24;13:26;"Uh, but it's such a good scene,"
13:26;13:28;"I wanted people to get a taste of it."
13:28;13:29;"Yeah."
13:29;13:30;"Even if it's not the taste, I guess--"
13:30;13:32;"You know, you could have chose one where you got to show off."
13:32;13:33;"Sure."
13:33;13:34;"But you let the other actor shine."
13:34;13:35;"Yes."
13:35;13:36;"So generous."
13:36;13:37;"It's very generous."
13:37;13:38;"That's exactly it, 'cause I'm gonna be honest with you."
13:38;13:42;"Tony Revolori, uh, he's the bellhop from Grand Budapest Hotel."
13:42;13:45;"He's Flash Thompson in, uh, the ""Spider-Man"" homecoming movie."
13:45;13:48;"He's a fantastic actor, and I really wanted the audience--"
13:48;13:49;"I'm here."
13:49;13:50;"You're getting to hear me."
13:50;13:53;"I wanted them to get a sense of what he's bringing to the picture."
13:53;13:54;"That's true."
13:54;13:55;"I call movies pictures."
13:55;13:56;"Don't worry about it."
13:56;13:57;"[laughs]"
13:57;13:58;"Love it."
13:58;14:00;"Okay, now, Jason--"
14:00;14:01;"Ezra."
14:01;14:02;"You seem to be--"
14:02;14:03;"Or Urza."
14:03;14:05;"You seem to be reacting very negatively."
14:05;14:07;"If I'm reading between the lines correctly,"
14:07;14:09;"when Jake was talking about doing music for the movie,"
14:09;14:12;"and you referred to how Dick Picks, his Grateful Dead cover man--"
14:12;14:13;"Oh, yes."
14:13;14:14;"--is now known as Richard Pictures--"
14:14;14:15;"I don't like it."
14:15;14:16;"--for at least a couple years."
14:16;14:17;"I don't like it."
14:17;14:18;"You don't like the name change."
14:18;14:22;"If I'm not mistaken, that is a term that exists"
14:22;14:24;"within the Grateful Dead community"
14:24;14:29;"that has nothing to do with salacious pictures of one's genitalia, correct?"
14:29;14:30;"Dick's Picks."
14:32;14:34;"The genius of the name was the pun."
14:34;14:35;"Correct."
14:35;14:39;"So to me, that is in and of itself a great name for a band"
14:39;14:43;"because you're playing on two different things, which is great."
14:43;14:45;"It's specific to the Dead community,"
14:45;14:50;"but also a little bit of a ribald joke, which I don't mind."
14:50;14:53;"So because we know how we got there, you're okay with it?"
14:53;14:56;"I'm 100%-- I'm not only okay with it, I think it's really good."
14:56;14:58;"To call it Richard's Pictures--"
14:58;14:59;"Richard Pictures."
14:59;15:06;"Richard Pictures adds obfuscation that eliminates at least one of the jokes."
15:06;15:08;"Jason, I'm in full agreement with you."
15:08;15:09;"Yeah, thank you."
15:09;15:12;"But the name hit some roadblocks publicly."
15:12;15:13;"Got it."
15:13;15:15;"We played some school fundraisers, and that makes sense."
15:15;15:19;"You've got to change the name for a school fundraiser."
15:19;15:21;"Well, how old-- like, what school?"
15:21;15:22;"Grade school."
15:22;15:24;"Grade school, okay, I understand that."
15:24;15:26;"Maybe don't call a band Dick Picks."
15:26;15:28;"And then we played some shows with Vampire Weekend."
15:28;15:30;"I just want to finish the thought real fast."
15:30;15:33;"Would you have had us open for you if we were called Dick Picks?"
15:33;15:34;"Oh, wow."
15:34;15:36;"I'm really glad I didn't have to make that decision, actually."
15:36;15:37;"Yeah, who knows?"
15:37;15:39;"Maybe we got some blowback."
15:39;15:41;"After Trump got elected, we got some blowback from--"
15:41;15:42;"Wait a minute."
15:42;15:43;"What are you saying right now?"
15:43;15:44;"I'm literally saying--"
15:44;15:48;"You're saying Trump got elected?"
15:48;15:52;"I, to be fair, have not been reading the news."
15:52;15:55;"President Hillary Clinton."
15:55;15:59;"Okay, yes, after Trump got elected, we got some blowback."
15:59;16:01;"Everyone kind of lost their mind."
16:01;16:04;"We got some blowback from some peers and friends."
16:04;16:07;"That you considered to be valid?"
16:07;16:08;"I struggled with it."
16:08;16:11;"And then I was just like, you know what, I'm not going to--"
16:11;16:12;"am I going to die on this hill?"
16:12;16:15;"But are we going to, like, kowtow to people who are, like,"
16:15;16:20;"going to say, like, I don't like the clever pun you've made"
16:20;16:23;"on the Grateful Dead Dick's Picks thing?"
16:23;16:24;"I don't know."
16:24;16:25;"It's a tough one, man."
16:25;16:28;"A cover band's name certainly could go too far."
16:28;16:29;"I guess."
16:29;16:31;"Can't think of any off the top of my head."
16:31;16:34;"It's honestly something I've struggled with these last few years."
16:34;16:37;"Okay, but Seinfeld, you'll know the answer to this."
16:37;16:38;"Can you get on the mic for a second?"
16:38;16:44;"Wasn't there a viral tweet where somebody wrote ""you"" using the ""you"""
16:44;16:46;"and then ""me"" in intellectual format?"
16:46;16:51;"For people who don't know, it's a Twitter format where you say"
16:51;16:53;"this is the simple thing that you would say,"
16:53;16:57;"and then you write ""me,"" an intellectual colon,"
16:57;17:00;"and then you say the more elevated thing that ""me,"" the intellectual, would say."
17:00;17:04;"So somebody wrote ""you, Dick Picks, me,"" in intellectual Richard Pictures."
17:04;17:06;"This is a big viral tweet."
17:06;17:07;"That's right."
17:07;17:08;"I mean, this thing was massive."
17:08;17:09;"I saw that too."
17:09;17:10;"How many retweets?"
17:10;17:11;"100,000."
17:11;17:12;"Wow."
17:12;17:15;"If I don't ask him to do a number crunch, he'll just pull some--"
17:15;17:17;"that's why I always got to ask him to do a number crunch."
17:17;17:18;"He just pulled that one out of his ass."
17:18;17:19;"38,000 retweets."
17:19;17:20;"That's major."
17:20;17:23;"175,461 likes."
17:23;17:25;"Okay, so anyway, my question is,"
17:25;17:32;"did Dick Picks the band invent the phrase ""Richard Pictures""?"
17:32;17:33;"As far as I know."
17:33;17:36;"Did this person come up with it independently?"
17:36;17:38;"I'm sure there's parallel thinking."
17:38;17:39;"You can get there."
17:39;17:40;"Yeah."
17:40;17:41;"Perhaps."
17:41;17:45;"Had you guys ever heard somebody refer to Dick Picks as Richard Pictures before?"
17:45;17:48;"No, we were playing an elementary school fundraiser in Silver Lake,"
17:48;17:51;"and we were like, ""We're not going to roll in as Dick Picks."""
17:51;17:55;"But you were interestingly hired as Dick Picks."
17:55;17:57;"True."
17:57;17:58;"A friend of ours was on--"
17:58;17:59;"So you know what?"
17:59;18:01;"At that point, this is on them."
18:01;18:04;"They hired a band called Dick Picks to play at an elementary school."
18:04;18:05;"Here's the thing."
18:05;18:13;"I mean, I would understand if you guys were projecting Dick Picks on a screen during your show."
18:13;18:15;"I would be like, ""That might be too much."""
18:15;18:18;"That might be like leaning in on the crass--"
18:18;18:20;"Right, like punk rock."
18:20;18:22;"Yeah, like the kind of--"
18:22;18:24;"And also, that wouldn't have a lot to do with the ethos of the Grateful Dead."
18:24;18:25;"Exactly."
18:25;18:26;"Whose music you're--"
18:26;18:28;"But being that you're not, I don't know."
18:28;18:33;"I'm also like, ""You know what? Come on. The band is Dick Picks. What is this?"""
18:33;18:34;"They'll always be Dick Picks to you."
18:34;18:36;"Always, until the day I die."
18:36;18:40;"Within the band, we refer to ourselves as Picks or Dick Picks."
18:40;18:41;"Oh, we got a Dick Picks show coming up."
18:41;18:43;"We don't call ourselves Richard Pictures."
18:43;18:45;"Well, Hannah, you want to weigh in on this?"
18:45;18:47;"Because when did you and Jake get married?"
18:47;18:48;"A year ago."
18:48;18:51;"So when you guys got married, was the band called Dick Picks or Richard Pictures?"
18:51;18:52;"Dick Picks."
18:52;18:53;"No, Pictures."
18:53;18:54;"Oh, yeah."
18:54;18:55;"I guess-- Was it?"
18:55;18:56;"Well, here's the thing."
18:56;18:57;"In our household--"
18:57;18:59;"Okay, but you were dating when the band was called Dick Picks."
18:59;19:00;"Yes."
19:00;19:04;"So you've been with Jake as a member of Dick Picks, as a member of Richard Pictures."
19:04;19:05;"You've kind of seen it all."
19:05;19:06;"I've seen it all."
19:06;19:09;"But in our house, it is still Dick Picks."
19:09;19:12;"Did you have any kind of point of view about the name change?"
19:12;19:15;"I thought in this instance it was really silly."
19:15;19:16;"To change the name?"
19:16;19:19;"Yeah. I thought it was unnecessary."
19:19;19:22;"And I want to go on record and say, if you're playing in elementary school, of course,"
19:22;19:26;"I don't mind obfuscating a potentially insane name like that."
19:26;19:28;"But what about opening for Vampire Weekend?"
19:28;19:30;"That I have no problem with."
19:30;19:33;"That band should be able to handle it because they are--"
19:33;19:36;"I mean, at least one of the members of that band is in Slipknot."
19:36;19:37;"Keep that in mind."
19:37;19:39;"I'm not sure we would have got the gig."
19:39;19:40;"This is crazy, man."
19:40;19:41;"I never even thought about this."
19:41;19:44;"That would have been real tough for me, I wonder."
19:44;19:46;"Because you couldn't come out afterwards and be like, ""Come on, guys."
19:46;19:47;"Keep it going for Dick Picks."""
19:47;19:49;"Well, why can't you guys have two names?"
19:49;19:50;"We basically do."
19:50;19:51;"Right."
19:51;19:54;"Dick Picks colon Richard's Pictures?"
19:54;19:55;"If I--"
19:55;19:56;"[laughter]"
19:56;19:57;"They're both good names."
19:57;19:58;"I'm not worried about a colon."
19:58;20:05;"When I post on Instagram about our shows, I just say, ""We are playing a show November 4th."""
20:05;20:06;"That's not helping you, though."
20:06;20:07;"And then I say--"
20:07;20:09;"That's not helping you to be like ""we,"" to be a ""we."""
20:09;20:11;"And then I say, ""#DickPicksBand."""
20:11;20:12;"Interesting."
20:12;20:13;"Is it--"
20:13;20:15;"All of this is about a Grateful Dead cover band."
20:15;20:16;"Here's what I'm going to-- spell it."
20:16;20:18;"How do you spell it?"
20:18;20:22;"D-I-C-K space P-I-C-S."
20:22;20:24;"Change the spelling to D-I-C."
20:24;20:25;"Ugh, no."
20:25;20:26;"D-I-C-D-I-C."
20:26;20:28;"Like Bic."
20:28;20:29;"Dick Pick."
20:29;20:30;"D-I-C-P-I-C."
20:30;20:31;"I don't like it."
20:31;20:32;"No?"
20:32;20:33;"You think that's worse?"
20:33;20:34;"Yeah."
20:34;20:38;"But also Dick Latvala, who was the curator for Dick Picks, spelled it D-I-C-K."
20:38;20:39;"Sure."
20:39;20:40;"So we need to have that resonance."
20:40;20:41;"What if you--"
20:41;20:44;"But you're currently calling it Richard's Pictures."
20:44;20:45;"Richard Pictures, sir."
20:45;20:46;"Apologies, apologies."
20:46;20:50;"What if you split the difference and called it Dickard Pictures?"
20:50;20:51;"Hmm."
20:51;20:54;"How about Deckard's Pictures and it's a Blade Runner band?"
20:54;20:55;"That could be cool."
20:55;20:58;"Instead of Grateful Dead, it's all Tangerine Dream."
20:58;21:01;"By the way, I'm into this band."
21:01;21:03;"Well, yeah, I mean, not that outlandish."
21:04;21:07;"[theme music]"
21:48;21:49;"You haven't answered the question."
21:49;21:51;"Would I still have had the band?"
21:51;21:52;"Dick Picks."
21:52;21:58;"Vampire Weekend returns with their first shows in five years, or whatever it is, three years."
21:58;22:01;"Two intimate shows in Ojai."
22:01;22:03;"Opening for the band Dick Picks."
22:03;22:04;"I still would have had you open."
22:04;22:05;"I mean--"
22:05;22:06;"Nice."
22:06;22:10;"But the truth is I never thought twice about it because I was very familiar with the reference."
22:10;22:14;"So if you hadn't told me that some people were uncomfortable with the name,"
22:14;22:16;"I may have just assumed you guys are Grateful Dead band."
22:16;22:19;"Most people you play to are Grateful Dead fans,"
22:19;22:24;"for whom the phrase Dick Picks in this context would immediately conjure up Dick's Picks"
22:24;22:28;"before it conjured up images of unwanted [bleep]"
22:28;22:29;"You know what?"
22:29;22:33;"If you had to change the name to something just like bad, Richard Pictures is a great name, too."
22:33;22:37;"If you had come to me and said, ""I have a band called Richard Pictures,"""
22:37;22:41;"I'd be like, ""Okay, it's not as good as Dick Picks, but it's certainly a fine name for a band."""
22:41;22:42;"That's a pretty good name."
22:42;22:45;"And you wouldn't also make the connection that it's a Grateful Dead cover band."
22:45;22:47;"It wouldn't at all occur to me."
22:47;22:48;"No."
22:48;22:49;"Dick Picks, you're like, ""Okay, Dick Picks."""
22:49;22:52;"Some portion of the population who knows the dead is going to--"
22:52;22:55;"that is going to be the first connection they make."
22:55;22:56;"Yeah."
22:56;22:58;"And then some people are going to be like, you know--"
22:58;23:00;"There's always an element of [bleep]"
23:00;23:01;"Yeah."
23:01;23:04;"We just got booked for next April to Ventura County Fairgrounds."
23:04;23:05;"Really?"
23:05;23:07;"There's a three-day Grateful Dead cover band pop festival."
23:07;23:08;"What?"
23:08;23:09;"This is amazing."
23:09;23:11;"We got a hot slot."
23:11;23:12;"Hot slot?"
23:12;23:14;"By the way, can't use that for a band name."
23:14;23:18;"Under your guys' logic, you couldn't use the name."
23:18;23:20;"You shouldn't be using the words ""hot slot."""
23:20;23:21;"Yeah."
23:21;23:22;"Right?"
23:22;23:23;"Can't say it."
23:23;23:24;"It's a hot shit cover band."
23:24;23:26;"Can't say ""hot slot."""
23:26;23:28;"Next up, hot slot."
23:28;23:29;"We got a prime slot."
23:29;23:31;"Slot's just a terrible word."
23:31;23:33;"We got a prime billing."
23:33;23:35;"Check this."
23:35;23:36;"Yeah."
23:36;23:42;"The opening afternoon of the festival, Friday afternoon at 3 p.m., hour-long set."
23:42;23:43;"Boom."
23:43;23:45;"So you're kicking things off."
23:45;23:46;"We're just like--"
23:46;23:51;"The vendors are setting up folding tables in those weird pop-up tents."
23:51;23:54;"And we're just going into Jack Straw."
23:56;24:02;"We can share the women."
24:02;24:04;"We can share the wine."
24:04;24:10;"We can share what we got to lose."
24:10;24:13;"Because we don't share all of mine."
24:13;24:23;"Keep on rolling, just a mile to go."
24:23;24:29;"Keep on rolling, my old buddy."
24:29;24:31;"You're moving much too slow."
24:38;24:44;"I just jumped the watchman right outside the fence."
24:44;24:47;"Took his dreams, wallbox, and change."
24:47;24:50;"Paid that heaven's sin."
24:50;24:52;"Hurts my ears to listen."
24:52;24:56;"Shining, it burns my eyes to see."
24:56;24:59;"Cut down a man in Corval and shine."
24:59;25:01;"Bodies will be free."
25:04;25:10;"Do you think at a Grateful Dead cover band festival, it's good vibes, as one would hope?"
25:10;25:14;"Or do you think you get a few people eyeing each other, just being like, ""Jerry wouldn't have done that""?"
25:14;25:15;"Oh, I'm sure."
25:15;25:17;"There's gotta be fights."
25:17;25:18;"Just arms folded."
25:18;25:22;"I went and saw Phil Lesch and friends last week."
25:22;25:23;"Yikes."
25:23;25:25;"As part of the Outlaw Music Festival."
25:25;25:27;"It was a straight-up yikes."
25:27;25:32;"Although, I will say, Sturgill Simpson was fantastic, as was Willie Nelson."
25:32;25:35;"But Phil Lesch and friends, very disappointing."
25:35;25:42;"But you could tell there was a sense of anger amongst my friends who were the dead fans."
25:42;25:49;"About what the two guys that were singing, one guy singing the Bob songs, one guy singing the Jerry songs, blah, blah, blah."
25:49;25:51;"And they were already getting into it."
25:51;25:56;"I was like, ""This must just be... I can't even imagine an entire festival."""
25:56;26:04;"I would love nothing more than if this Grateful Dead Tribute Band Festival ended in an absolute riot."
26:04;26:05;"Like a full melee."
26:05;26:09;"This is the ugly truth, is that most hippies are not chill."
26:09;26:10;"Yeah."
26:10;26:15;"And the name of the subtitle, as we looked it up, the subtitle of the festival is Altamont 2?"
26:15;26:18;"That seems like it's asking for trouble."
26:18;26:19;"Bad vibes, man."
26:19;26:20;"Not good."
26:20;26:21;"I was actually like..."
26:21;26:24;"Oh, yeah, Jerry's cameo in Altamont is amazing."
26:24;26:26;"Or in Gimme Shelter."
26:26;26:27;"Oh, yeah."
26:27;26:29;"He's like, ""Oh, that's a bummer, man."""
26:29;26:31;"He's got one line in the whole talk."
26:31;26:36;"I heard he had more lines, but he got cut out a lot because his readings were not very good."
26:36;26:40;"I was watching some recent Phish videos."
26:40;26:42;"I was kind of curious, watching some Phish live."
26:42;26:43;"As you do."
26:43;26:46;"As one does, late night, getting ready for bed."
26:46;26:47;"Are you a Phish fan?"
26:47;26:51;"Growing up, I was never a Phish fan, but as I've gotten older, I've become more interested in Phish."
26:51;26:58;"I was struck by Phish is the epitome of really good musicians just having fun."
26:58;27:09;"The fans are open-minded, and they'll do little musical jokes, jump on trampolines, historically, do goofy covers, have fun."
27:09;27:11;"The drummer plays a vacuum cleaner."
27:11;27:13;"Yeah, they'll do stuff like that."
27:13;27:19;"Hating on Phish is just kind of absurd, because they're just having fun."
27:19;27:26;"Then there's a handful of commenters where I rate at how Trey's tone had changed on this tour."
27:26;27:30;"They were just like, ""Trey's tone f*cking sucks. I'm a huge Phish fan."""
27:30;27:32;"A few people were like, ""Yo, chill."""
27:32;27:34;"They were so angry about Trey's tone."
27:34;27:36;"I was like, ""Damn, even in the Phish head community?"""
27:36;27:39;"Emotionally invested in that aesthetic, man."
27:39;27:41;"This is like Dylan going electric."
27:41;27:42;"Yeah."
27:42;27:43;"Trey's tone?"
27:43;27:44;"Trey's tone slightly changed."
27:44;27:47;"Oh, man. Bouncing around the room never sounded the same."
27:47;27:49;"He boosted some mids, and I was done."
27:49;27:54;"The woman was a dream I had, though rather hard to keep."
27:54;28:01;"For when my eyes were watching her as they closed, and I was still asleep."
28:01;28:07;"For when my hand was holding hers, she whispered words, and I awoke."
28:07;28:14;"And faintly bouncing 'round the room, the echo of whomever spoke."
28:14;28:25;"And I awoke, and faintly bouncing 'round the room, the echo of whomever spoke."
28:25;28:33;"The place I sought was far beneath the surface of the sea."
28:33;28:40;"My sight was poor, but I was sure the sirens sang their song for me."
28:40;28:46;"They dance above me as I sing. I see them through a crystal haze."
28:46;28:53;"And hear them bouncing 'round the room, the never-ending choral maze."
28:53;29:03;"The crystal haze. And hear them bouncing 'round the room, the never-ending choral maze."
29:03;29:07;"Then before, and now once more, I'm bouncing 'round the room."
29:07;29:10;"So speaking of Dylan, we got a lot to talk about."
29:10;29:16;"On my Instagram account, I've been sharing some interest in a certain type of font family."
29:16;29:18;"Probably some TC heads have seen this."
29:18;29:20;"Is that what you call your fans? TC heads?"
29:20;29:21;"The fans of Time Crisis."
29:21;29:27;"Are you getting any kind of conflicting fan base with the character TC from Magnum P.I.?"
29:27;29:28;"Not familiar."
29:28;29:32;"Because I'm a member, I'm a TC head. I am a TC head."
29:32;29:33;"Of the original TC heads."
29:33;29:39;"I am a TC head, meaning TC, the helicopter pilot character from the Magnum P.I. series and the reboot."
29:39;29:43;"The drummer of Vampire Weekend is named CT, Chris Thompson."
29:43;29:50;"And we once had a bus driver who CT kind of had a good rapport with."
29:50;29:55;"And they would chat about, you know, the drive and maybe they'd talk about sports or something."
29:55;29:56;"That's a good rapport?"
29:56;29:57;"They had a pretty good rapport."
29:57;30:01;"In your mind, a good rapport is talking about the drive or sports?"
30:01;30:05;"Well, I don't talk about sports or drive, so I feel alienated from it."
30:05;30:11;"But I just remember Chris telling us that at some point, like, they'd been building this bond for weeks or something."
30:11;30:14;"And maybe I'm probably amping this up too much."
30:14;30:19;"But then at the end of the tour or something, like, Chris was like, you know, it's been really great getting to know you, Gary, or whatever."
30:19;30:21;"And then he said like, all right, you too, TC."
30:21;30:25;"Yeah, all right. Yeah, you too, TC."
30:25;30:27;"Have a good one, man."
30:27;30:29;"I've had that experience, too."
30:29;30:33;"I once had a very long conversation with someone like I vaguely knew."
30:33;30:36;"And then at the end of the -- you know, like really just talking about life and shit."
30:36;30:38;"And they called me Elijah."
30:38;30:40;"But I was like with it."
30:40;30:42;"I never get mad about that."
30:42;30:46;"Yeah, I feel like if somebody -- people are allowed to make that mistake."
30:46;30:52;"If somebody treats you with respect and then they confidently say the wrong name, who cares?"
30:52;30:53;"Yeah."
30:53;30:57;"Except for the fact that you've been disrespected because your name is all you have."
30:57;31:01;"It represents -- it literally is all you are is your name."
31:01;31:09;"So for them to specifically call you a different name is to literally rob you of your identity."
31:09;31:15;"And it's a power move that basically shames you, that erases you from the equation."
31:15;31:17;"So, like, yeah, I get it."
31:17;31:25;"But no matter how kind and sweet they've been, they are really just removing the individuality of who you are."
31:25;31:30;"I have a really positive heart-to-heart with, like, a 90-year-old person."
31:30;31:32;"And they get the name wrong, like, hey, don't sweat it."
31:32;31:34;"And then I walk away and then I, like, pause."
31:34;31:36;"That pops in my head and I just walk back."
31:36;31:38;"But at the same time, my name is me."
31:38;31:39;"You just erased me."
31:39;31:40;"Yeah."
31:40;31:41;"Honestly, f--- you."
31:41;31:42;"Because you know what?"
31:42;31:46;"Later that 90-year-old is like, I had a nice chat with that Elijah boy."
31:46;31:48;"Who's Elijah?"
31:48;31:50;"Ah, the boy who was here earlier."
31:50;31:52;"I was talking to him, Elijah."
31:52;31:53;"I don't know who that is."
31:53;31:55;"But now it doesn't register."
31:55;31:58;"There is no way to even trace down who you are."
31:58;31:59;"It's kind of like when--"
31:59;32:00;"You don't exist."
32:00;32:03;"At that point, Ezra, you don't exist."
32:03;32:05;"It's kind of like when Dick Picks became Richard Pictures."
32:05;32:06;"It is!"
32:06;32:08;"It's the same thing!"
32:08;32:09;"A history."
32:09;32:10;"I don't like that at all."
32:10;32:11;"A band vanished."
32:11;32:13;"You better guess who's in Richard's pictures."
32:13;32:14;"Elijah!"
32:14;32:15;"You know what I'm saying?"
32:15;32:16;"Richard Pictures."
32:17;32:18;"[laughter]"
32:18;32:19;"Okay, but anyway."
32:19;32:20;"Oh, Joker Man."
32:20;32:21;"We're talking about fonts."
32:21;32:23;"Without going into it, I love fonts."
32:23;32:26;"They started in the late '80s, moved into the '90s."
32:26;32:29;"These kind of fun, post--"
32:29;32:30;"What would you call them?"
32:30;32:31;"Neo-hippie type fonts."
32:31;32:34;"A lot of handwritten ones."
32:34;32:37;"The Cure was kind of pioneers of it."
32:37;32:40;"And then once you get to the '90s, you see all these wacky, fun fonts."
32:40;32:41;"I've seen it--"
32:41;32:48;"As I started talking about it a lot, some people have told me that some people call this family of fonts Global Coffeehouse."
32:48;32:49;"Oh, sure."
32:49;32:51;"Which is right on."
32:51;32:52;"That's a great way to put it."
32:52;32:59;"And the most basic version of all these fonts, the one that you could actually maybe have on the family computer, is called Joker Man."
32:59;33:02;"And Joker Man, you see it pop up."
33:02;33:06;"I recently saw a barbershop in Hollywood that used Joker Man font."
33:06;33:10;"And it's a font that has a lot of energy, a playfulness."
33:10;33:14;"You could say maybe a touch of hippiness about it, but it's fun."
33:14;33:21;"Anyway, so Joker Man is perhaps like one of the pillars of this font family, this font community."
33:21;33:24;"And I was posting about the font Joker Man."
33:24;33:31;"Then a friend of mine I actually know through CT, Nick Mancia, hit me up saying, ""Yeah, and how about that Bob Dylan song, Joker Man?"""
33:31;33:32;"And I vaguely knew that song."
33:32;33:34;"I hadn't thought about it in a long time."
33:34;33:37;"Then I returned and I started listening to this Bob Dylan song, Joker Man."
33:37;33:40;"And I realized, I love this song."
33:40;33:42;"This is a great Bob Dylan song."
33:42;33:46;"And it's from '80s Dylan, which is not considered one of Bob's greatest periods."
33:46;33:49;"But I think the real Bob Dylan has considered this one of his best songs."
33:49;33:52;"His voice was starting to sound a little different in the '80s."
33:52;33:56;"But I got so into this song, I even started to think, ""You know what?"
33:56;33:59;"Maybe one day Vampire Weekend will get a cover of this going."""
33:59;34:00;"That'd be sick."
34:00;34:01;"It'd be tight."
34:01;34:05;"So anyway, this is also a very early warning shot to the Vampire Weekend fan community."
34:05;34:07;"Lightly familiarize yourself with Joker Man."
34:07;34:08;"What are they called?"
34:08;34:10;"So if we bust it out."
34:10;34:14;"It's funny. The Time Crisis community are called TC Heads."
34:14;34:17;"Vampire Weekend has never had a good name for our fans."
34:17;34:18;"Really?"
34:18;34:19;"Yeah."
34:19;34:20;"Like the Weekenders?"
34:20;34:21;"It's too much of a mouthful."
34:21;34:23;"I don't think it goes down easy."
34:23;34:24;"How about this?"
34:24;34:29;"Let's do a contest where somebody in the audience gets to name the fans of Vampire Weekend."
34:29;34:32;"And we'll just let them have that for real for the rest of time."
34:32;34:33;"Let's try it."
34:33;34:35;"I have a feeling we've put this out there before."
34:35;34:37;"It just never anything-- nothing clicks."
34:37;34:38;"But yeah, please."
34:38;34:39;"If anybody has any ideas, let us know."
34:39;34:42;"But anyway, also just generally saying to Vampire Weekend fans,"
34:42;34:45;"maybe next year VW bust this out and you'll be like, ""Oh yeah, I know that song."""
34:45;34:47;"Anyway, this is the song Joker Man."
34:47;34:54;"Sly and Robbie, famous reggae rhythm section playing on this."
34:54;34:58;"Mark Knopfler, some real tasteful guitar licks coming in and out."
34:58;34:59;"He also produced it."
35:08;35:09;"That knob flick."
35:09;35:12;"[MUSIC - SLY AND ROBBIE, ""JOKER MAN""]"
35:23;35:48;"A lot of great lyrics in this song."
35:48;35:50;"Demanding bass playing, too."
35:50;35:51;"Yeah, I remember that."
35:51;35:54;"[MUSIC - SLY AND ROBBIE, ""JOKER MAN""]"
36:31;36:34;"It's a great song, but it made me think a little bit about--"
36:34;36:38;"'80s Dylan was the time when his voice started to put people off, I think."
36:38;36:40;"Maybe it started in the '70s."
36:40;36:43;"He's really, like, leaning into some of the Dylanisms."
36:43;36:44;"Right."
36:44;36:46;"I mean, he's still got his range at this point."
36:46;36:51;"Yeah, it's not really until, I feel like, the '90s that he really starts to lose--"
36:51;36:55;"it starts to get narrower and more ragged."
36:55;36:57;"He can't articulate melodies, really."
36:57;37:03;"In this moment, I think his voice was becoming a little more idiosyncratic."
37:03;37:06;"Was it? Or just maybe the Dylan fan sort of soured on it?"
37:06;37:07;"What year is this?"
37:07;37:10;"This is '83, '84."
37:10;37:12;"Is this religious Dylan?"
37:12;37:13;"This is right after that period."
37:13;37:14;"Right after?"
37:14;37:16;"This is when he stopped being Christian."
37:16;37:20;"Well, anyway, it's a great song, and because I was watching the video a bunch,"
37:20;37:24;"YouTube suggested I also check out a video of Bob Dylan at We Are The World."
37:24;37:27;"And this is cool. I'd never seen this before."
37:27;37:34;"Bob Dylan is one of the people singing on the famous charity song We Are The World."
37:34;37:36;"♪ We are the world, we are the children ♪"
37:36;37:39;"So he sings in the choir with all the other stars."
37:39;37:40;"Sure."
37:40;37:43;"Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, all the big stars of the '80s."
37:43;37:47;"He's kind of one of the only '60s dudes in the mix."
37:47;37:52;"And I guess at a certain point he had to record his part."
37:52;37:55;"And he's a little bit the odd man out, and so there's this footage on YouTube."
37:55;37:59;"It's nine minutes of him just, like, trying to get his part down."
37:59;38:02;"Stevie Wonders in the background helping him out playing piano."
38:02;38:03;"That's where he's going in on it."
38:03;38:04;"Stevie."
38:05;38:07;"Can you play it one time?"
38:07;38:08;"Come on, man."
38:08;38:10;"So he's working on it with--"
38:10;38:12;"Stevie's helping him out."
38:12;38:13;"Diana Ross is leaving the room."
38:13;38:18;"Giving him some space to get it right."
38:18;38:20;"He's kind of showing it to him."
38:20;38:22;"He gets back on the mic."
38:22;38:24;"Again, doesn't seem that--seems a little uncomfortable."
38:24;38:27;"♪ We're saving our own lives ♪"
38:27;38:30;"♪ It's true, we make a better day ♪"
38:30;38:31;"♪ Just you and me ♪"
38:31;38:35;"Although he's in tune."
38:35;38:37;"What's that?"
38:37;38:38;"Just stay right in the mic like that, Bobby."
38:38;38:39;"That's beautiful."
38:39;38:42;"And you know what's nice, man, is you sing along with the chorus like that, too."
38:42;38:44;"Quincy being very supportive."
38:44;38:45;"It's so funny."
38:45;38:48;"His speaking voice is almost like he's in character, too."
38:48;38:49;"Okay."
38:49;38:50;"That's beautiful."
38:50;38:53;"Because that's the only time we use the low octave."
38:53;38:54;"All right, man."
38:54;38:55;"It's time to--"
38:55;38:56;"He looks so deeply uncomfortable."
38:56;38:58;"It's fascinating that Dylan, yeah, like, he's in key."
38:58;38:59;"It's not that he can't sing."
38:59;39:04;"He's really--watching the video is interesting because he's like--"
39:04;39:06;"he's posturing in a funny way."
39:06;39:10;"He's got, like, this very funny physicality that, like, belies how uncomfortable he is."
39:10;39:11;"Right."
39:11;39:15;"The thumb has not left his pocket, weirdly."
39:21;39:24;"And as always, he always nails it when they're kind of rehearsing."
39:24;39:26;"And then they're like, ""Let's roll tape."""
39:26;39:28;"And it just never sounds quite as good."
39:28;39:30;"We've all had that experience."
39:30;39:34;"Also, I feel like this type of situation has a lot--like, the person who has to do something is uncomfortable."
39:34;39:37;"And they're just like, ""Is that sort of it?"""
39:37;39:39;"And everybody's like, ""Oh, yeah!"""
39:39;39:41;"""You're f---ing killing it."""
39:41;39:44;"I wonder if they asked Neil Young to do this."
39:44;39:47;"I'm sure they did, but I'm sure, like, everything he said, ""No."""
39:47;39:50;"I feel like Neil Young is the--"
39:50;39:51;"Surprisingly--"
39:51;39:53;"--Murray of rock."
39:53;39:54;"Well, Dylan, too, is."
39:54;39:55;"I mean, surprising he did it."
39:55;39:58;"You've heard the David Lee Roth tapes, right?"
39:58;39:59;"I don't think I have."
39:59;40:02;"On this show, we've never gotten deep on, like, the recordings of people."
40:02;40:04;"What's the David Lee Roth one?"
40:04;40:06;"David Lee Roth, ""Running with the Devil."""
40:06;40:07;"Just, like, isolated vocal?"
40:07;40:08;"Oh, yeah."
40:08;40:09;"Oh, my God."
40:09;40:10;"I love this stuff."
40:10;40:12;"This is actually from the record?"
40:12;40:14;"I think-- I believe this is it."
40:14;40:16;"Oh!"
40:16;40:20;"Oh, yes!"
40:20;40:24;"Yeah, yeah!"
40:24;40:26;"Ha, yeah!"
40:26;40:28;"[laughter]"
40:28;40:33;"I live my life like there's no tomorrow."
40:33;40:35;"And all I've got--"
40:35;40:36;"Good vibrato."
40:36;40:38;"--I had to steal."
40:38;40:43;"Least I don't need Tobago Burrow."
40:43;40:44;"Burrow!"
40:44;40:49;"Yes, I'm living at a base that kills."
40:49;40:51;"Oh, yeah!"
40:51;40:52;"[laughter]"
40:52;40:57;"[screeching]"
40:57;41:00;"[laughter]"
41:00;41:02;"It's all the incidental noises."
41:02;41:03;"Yeah, right."
41:03;41:04;"He has a good voice."
41:04;41:05;"He's like--"
41:05;41:06;"Oh, yeah."
41:06;41:07;"How does he do that?"
41:07;41:08;"[screeching]"
41:08;41:09;"But it's like--"
41:09;41:10;"[screeching]"
41:10;41:12;"He's almost getting into some weird, like, throat-singing territory, like hitting two--"
41:12;41:14;"Like a two-tone throat singer?"
41:14;41:15;"He's getting two tones?"
41:15;41:16;"Yeah, exactly."
41:16;41:17;"He's getting pretty two-tone."
41:17;41:21;"I remember stumbling across the Chris Cornell vocals from, like, Bad Motor Finger era Soundgarden."
41:21;41:22;"Yeah."
41:22;41:23;"Singing is so brutal."
41:23;41:24;"Insanity."
41:24;41:26;"Shout-out to anybody who, like, goes for it."
41:26;41:30;"Well, I've got a feeling so down"
41:30;41:34;"I've got a feeling so down"
41:34;41:38;"I kept the movie rolling"
41:38;41:43;"But the story's getting old now"
41:43;41:45;"Oh, yeah"
41:45;41:52;"I just looked in the mirror"
41:52;41:56;"And things aren't looking so good"
41:56;42:00;"I'm looking California"
42:01;42:05;"And feeling Minnesota"
42:05;42:08;"Oh, yeah"
42:08;42:19;"Who gets mystified?"
42:19;42:25;"Who gets mystified?"
42:26;42:31;"Show me the power of child I'd like to save"
42:31;42:35;"But I'm down on my knees today"
42:35;42:39;"Yeah, it gives me the butterflies"
42:39;42:41;"Gives me a way"
42:41;42:45;"'Til I'm up on my feet again"
42:45;42:47;"Hey, I'm feeling"
42:47;42:53;"Oh, I'm feeling all shine, all shine, all shine, all shine"
42:53;42:57;"Another thing we should say about Joker Man, the font,"
42:57;43:01;"is that it's on the back of these new 8-minute Cape Cod long sleeves."
43:01;43:04;"We just got a shipment of how many?"
43:04;43:06;"We got 50 long sleeves."
43:06;43:10;"I mean, to be fair, a lot of the Time Crisis fat cats are gonna skim off the top."
43:10;43:12;"The TCFCs?"
43:12;43:14;"The TCFCs."
43:14;43:20;"The TCFCs, you know, the friends and family of the inner circle of Time Crisis, the elites."
43:20;43:22;"Skimming 20% right off the top."
43:22;43:24;"They're already skimming off these."
43:24;43:29;"But Seinfeld took the classic 8-minute Cape Cod shirt and put it on a black long sleeve."
43:29;43:33;"'Cause we've done white shirts, we've done tie-dye,"
43:33;43:36;"but we've never done just a very simple, tasteful black long sleeve."
43:36;43:43;"It says ""8-minute Cape Cod,"" and on the back, it says one of Jake's classic quotes, ""This show rules."""
43:43;43:46;"And Seinfeld, when you first sent me it, I thought it looked great."
43:46;43:47;"I had one note."
43:47;43:50;"On the back, you put that s*** in Joker Man."
43:50;43:52;"Joker Man's a really hot font right now."
43:52;43:56;"Everybody's talking about it, and I just knew that the fans were gonna love it."
43:56;43:59;"You got Futura on the front, Joker Man in the back."
43:59;44:00;"Why not Joker Man on the front?"
44:00;44:02;"Maybe next time--we'll see how these ones do."
44:02;44:03;"Next time we can switch it up."
44:03;44:06;"Futura bold on the back, Joker Man on the front."
44:06;44:08;"I'd like a one-off all Joker Man."
44:08;44:11;"All Joker Man?"
44:11;44:16;"I want a shirt that just says, ""In Joker Man, all Joker Man."""
44:16;44:18;"All Joker Man?"
44:18;44:20;"I actually had this thought."
44:20;44:21;"That's sick."
44:21;44:23;"And on the back, TCFC."
44:23;44:24;"That's tight."
44:24;44:30;"You know, it's funny you say that because I guess Time Crisis has also proven to be a very good dry run for Vampire Weekend."
44:30;44:35;"It's a place where we can speak freely, come up with ideas such as 8-minute Cape Cod, you know?"
44:35;44:37;"Which then we can implement later."
44:37;44:40;"This is kind of, in some ways, Vampire Weekend R&D."
44:40;44:41;"A laboratory."
44:41;44:42;"It's a laboratory."
44:42;44:45;"This is the test kitchen for Vampire Weekend."
44:45;44:50;"Wait, isn't there like a Chipotle test kitchen in New York?"
44:50;44:52;"Everybody has--oh, I don't know about in New York."
44:52;44:55;"I went to the Panda Express one in Pasadena."
44:55;44:56;"And you're alive?"
44:56;44:57;"Oh, yeah."
44:57;44:59;"Wait, what happens at the Panda Express test kitchen?"
44:59;45:01;"It's the same thing that happens."
45:01;45:02;"It's organic chicken?"
45:02;45:03;"No."
45:04;45:05;"It's basically the same."
45:05;45:06;"It's just like Plucker's."
45:06;45:10;"It's a lovely breast of chicken, lovingly, tenderly grilled."
45:10;45:12;"Does Plucker's have a test kitchen?"
45:12;45:14;"I guarantee Plucker's has a test kitchen."
45:14;45:18;"If you work at the Plucker's test kitchen, get in touch with us."
45:18;45:20;"Okay, wait, by the way, rewind."
45:20;45:22;"[rewind sound]"
45:22;45:23;"What is a test kitchen?"
45:23;45:26;"Because I assume that a test kitchen used to be like--"
45:26;45:29;"you could imagine some big food corporation would have a test kitchen"
45:29;45:31;"where they literally are testing their food products."
45:31;45:34;"But then it did become this thing where a lot of these chain restaurants"
45:34;45:40;"have test kitchens that are really just a slightly more upscale version of the spot."
45:40;45:42;"Oh, wait, is that a real thing?"
45:42;45:44;"Yeah, the Panda Express test kitchen."
45:44;45:46;"It's not like you got ushered into--"
45:46;45:47;"Like an industrial park?"
45:47;45:50;"Yeah, you weren't on the 20th floor of Panda Express headquarters."
45:50;45:52;"No, no, no, it was in sort of like--"
45:52;45:54;"PEHQ."
45:54;45:55;"An upscale strip mall."
45:55;45:57;"It's just a Panda Express."
45:57;45:58;"Ooh, upscale."
45:58;46:00;"You had me at upscale strip mall."
46:00;46:02;"There's a Nordstrom rack."
46:02;46:05;"Was there anything about the ambiance of this Panda Express test kitchen"
46:05;46:07;"that was a cut above?"
46:07;46:11;"Yeah, it was a few years ago, but I remember thinking, ""This is awesome."""
46:11;46:12;"Yeah."
46:12;46:15;"[laughter]"
46:15;46:16;"That's what you remember thinking?"
46:16;46:17;"Yeah."
46:17;46:18;"""This is awesome."""
46:18;46:19;"I think I actually--"
46:19;46:21;"Maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I went twice."
46:21;46:22;"Oh, wow."
46:22;46:23;"Yeah."
46:23;46:24;"Wait, so you really liked it?"
46:24;46:25;"No, no, no."
46:25;46:28;"Someone, a producer, asked if I wanted to have a meeting there."
46:28;46:29;"Really?"
46:29;46:33;"The answer is no, because that person's a murderer, not a producer."
46:33;46:34;"[laughter]"
46:34;46:37;"Nobody has a meeting at a Panda Express test kitchen."
46:37;46:38;"What were you--"
46:38;46:39;"But see--"
46:39;46:40;"The producer for what?"
46:40;46:41;"The producer for--"
46:41;46:42;"Because when you look up fast food--"
46:42;46:43;"Porno?"
46:43;46:44;"When you look up fast food--"
46:44;46:45;"Was it a porno producer?"
46:45;46:46;"Porno."
46:46;46:47;"It was an Oscar-nominated producer."
46:47;46:48;"Okay."
46:48;46:49;"Oh, God."
46:49;46:51;"Maybe that's their way of showing you, ""I'm down to earth, but not that down to earth."""
46:51;46:52;"Exactly, yeah."
46:52;46:56;"I'd love to take you to the Panda Express test kitchen."
46:56;47:00;"But there's no part of the Panda Express test kitchen where you kind of see through a window"
47:00;47:01;"and you see people in lab coats."
47:01;47:02;"No, no, no."
47:02;47:03;"No."
47:03;47:04;"How did we start talking about test kitchens?"
47:04;47:05;"I have a question for you."
47:05;47:06;"Yeah."
47:06;47:09;"Have you ever been on the website dafonts.com?"
47:09;47:10;"Dafonts?"
47:10;47:11;"Yeah."
47:11;47:12;"I don't think so."
47:12;47:13;"Is it just where you find fonts?"
47:13;47:14;"Yeah."
47:14;47:15;"I've spent hours on that."
47:15;47:16;"I've seen other people on it."
47:16;47:17;"Do you think they--"
47:17;47:18;"I'm really busy."
47:18;47:25;"I wonder if they have a hashtag that you can search for global coffee house fonts, because"
47:25;47:28;"I'd love to find some more behind-- Oh, you know what?"
47:28;47:29;"Now I remembered."
47:29;47:30;"This is great radio."
47:30;47:33;"We were saying that Time Crisis is a bit of a test kitchen."
47:33;47:34;"It's kind of a Panda--"
47:34;47:35;"Yes, Vampire Weekend's test kitchen."
47:35;47:37;"It's a bit of a Panda Express test kitchen."
47:37;47:42;"I did have this idea that some ideas maybe are too outlandish for the larger Vampire"
47:42;47:47;"Weekend fan community, but the TC heads, which is not exclusively Vampire Weekend fans--"
47:47;47:49;"I think we've joked about this before."
47:49;47:53;"Is there anybody who just hates Vampire Weekend, who's like, ""Love Time Crisis, though""?"
47:53;47:54;"I bet there is."
47:54;47:55;"There's probably a few people."
47:55;47:56;"Write in."
47:56;47:57;"Yeah, let us know."
47:57;47:58;"Would love to know."
47:58;48:02;"Hashtag love that TC, hashtag hate that VM."
48:02;48:03;"Hate that V-Dubs."
48:03;48:04;"V-Dubs, rather."
48:04;48:10;"But I was saying, I did have this idea a while ago of Vampire Weekend maybe could just do"
48:10;48:14;"some font shirts, and it would be the Vampire Weekend Joker Man shirt, and it would say"
48:14;48:19;"Vampire Weekend Joker Man, and then maybe on the back say Joker Man shirt, or have the"
48:19;48:22;"whole alphabet on the sleeves or something."
48:22;48:23;"Really lean into it."
48:23;48:27;"At first, I was trying to think which fonts would be fun to do, and then I realized Papyrus"
48:27;48:29;"is kind of played out to joke about."
48:29;48:33;"SNL did a sketch about Papyrus already, and of course, Comic Sans is beyond dead."
48:33;48:34;"Zapf dingbats."
48:34;48:35;"It's a Zapf dingbat shirt."
48:35;48:40;"It's all Zapf dingbats on the front and the sleeves, and then in the back in Joker Man,"
48:40;48:44;"it's like a full essay that explains the front part says Vampire Weekend."
48:44;48:45;"I would also love-"
48:45;48:46;"Zapf dingbats."
48:46;48:47;"Yeah."
48:47;48:52;"I would also love it if it just on the back said Zapf dingbats in Joker Man font."
48:52;48:53;"In Joker Man."
48:53;48:54;"That's like-"
48:54;48:56;"Joker Man dance to the light of the moon."
48:56;48:59;"But I've also been thinking about Joker Man is a fascinating font."
48:59;49:00;"It's a fascinating song."
49:00;49:04;"And then I was also thinking about something, because as I really poured over the lyrics"
49:04;49:07;"to Bob Dylan's Joker Man, which I recommend everybody spend some time with."
49:07;49:08;"It's a very strong song."
49:08;49:10;"He keeps talking about this person, Joker Man."
49:10;49:15;"It's almost like, as in a lot of Bob Dylan songs, he's pulling from ancient history,"
49:15;49:18;"Americana, his own mythology."
49:18;49:19;"And you're like, who is Joker Man?"
49:19;49:20;"Is he talking to himself?"
49:20;49:23;"I saw some people in the comments saying, ""We're all Joker Man."""
49:23;49:25;"And then I kept thinking, yeah, who's the Joker Man?"
49:25;49:27;"Is it the Joker?"
49:27;49:28;"Is it the Joker Man?"
49:28;49:30;"Is it like the Joker?"
49:30;49:32;"Is it the Joker in the deck of cards?"
49:32;49:35;"And then I realized, if you just want to call somebody a joker, you'd say joker."
49:35;49:36;"Right?"
49:36;49:37;"There's probably a lot of songs."
49:37;49:40;"There's the Joker by an enemy of the show, Steve Miller."
49:40;49:42;"I didn't know you guys had enemies."
49:42;49:43;"Oh, yeah, we hate Steve Miller."
49:43;49:44;"Oh, I get it."
49:44;49:47;"He talked about Jerry Garcia after Jerry had passed."
49:47;49:48;"Oh, interesting."
49:48;49:52;"And while Jerry was alive, he had no problem opening up for the Grateful Dead and even"
49:52;49:54;"sitting in with them on occasion."
49:54;49:58;"Back in '92, and then he also ignored our pleas on social media."
49:58;50:00;"We wanted him to come clear his name."
50:00;50:01;"Yeah."
50:01;50:05;"That's surprising because he was so cool about his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction."
50:05;50:06;"Wait, Steve Miller?"
50:06;50:07;"Right?"
50:07;50:10;"Wasn't he like a total asshole about it a couple years ago?"
50:10;50:11;"Oh, really?"
50:11;50:12;"That does ring a bell."
50:12;50:14;"He was like really pissed off and was basically like, ""Fuck you guys."""
50:14;50:15;"Oh, yeah."
50:15;50:17;"Let's put a pin in that one."
50:17;50:18;"Let's return to that."
50:18;50:20;"We'll return to Steve Miller shortly."
50:20;50:22;"So I was thinking, what does this mean, Joker Man?"
50:22;50:28;"And then I had a thought that Joker Man is kind of like Joker plus Batman."
50:28;50:33;"Joker Man is kind of a yin yang that has the hero and the villain combined."
50:33;50:34;"Joker Man."
50:34;50:38;"And actually, in the music video for Bob Dylan's Joker Man, there's even an image of the Joker,"
50:38;50:39;"the DC character."
50:39;50:41;"So I started to think more."
50:41;50:44;"Joker Man is a hybrid of Joker and Batman."
50:44;50:45;"Whoa."
50:45;50:49;"The good and the evil, and the good that's in the evil, and the evil that's in the good."
50:49;50:50;"You know what I'm saying?"
50:50;50:51;"Joker Man."
50:51;50:52;"That's humanity."
50:52;50:53;"Combo."
50:53;50:54;"That's deep."
50:55;50:56;"I'm going to go ahead and get started."
51:13;51:38;"I'm going to go ahead and get started."
51:38;51:43;"I'm going to go ahead and get started."

01:15:44;01:16:04;"I feel like, fairly or not, Starship became the cliché of the 60s band."
01:16:04;01:16:10;"I feel like there was a Diplomats or Cam'ron song, like a mixtape song that sampled this"
01:16:10;01:16:15;"that went like, ""We built this city on rock."""
01:16:15;01:16:24;"Instead of rock and roll, we built this city on rock."
01:16:24;01:16:48;"Oh yeah! [laughs] [music]"
01:16:48;01:17:00;"I mean, when it works, it works."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"That's a pretty good double meaning."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"We built this city on rock and roll, but they're talking about drugs."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"We built this city on rock."
01:17:06;01:17:12;"Also, yeah, them singing, ""We built this city on rock and roll,"" this is the most canned"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"square usage."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Sentiment?"
01:17:14;01:17:15;"Yeah, exactly."
01:17:15;01:17:21;"Anyway, the number five song back in 2018, Marshmello and Bastille, ""Happier."""
01:17:21;01:17:42;"I guess this song really has got some legs."
01:17:42;01:18:12;"[music] The number four song back in '85, after Starship,"
01:18:12;01:18:17;"""We Built This City,"" is another city song, ""You Belong to the City"" by Glenn Frey."
01:18:17;01:18:18;"Oh, wow."
01:18:18;01:18:23;"Who was a member of the Eagles, and he wrote the song for the Miami Vice soundtrack, which"
01:18:23;01:18:34;"was a popular TV show in the '80s."
01:18:41;01:18:45;"There's a Pepsi commercial in '85 featuring Frey and Miami Vice star Don Johnson."
01:18:45;01:18:49;"They used a version of this song with product-specific lyrics."
01:18:49;01:18:54;"Now, the other guy on Miami Vice, Philip Michael Thomas, did not appear in that commercial"
01:18:54;01:18:58;"due to prior obligations for a sun-kissed grape commercial."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"These guys are cleaning up."
01:19:03;01:19:08;"Glenn Frey and Don Johnson seem like two peas in a pod."
01:19:08;01:19:16;"Oh, yeah, they probably had some fun nights back in the '80s."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"Really taking a long time for the vocals to kick in."
01:19:20;01:19:47;"It doesn't even sound like Glenn Frey."
01:19:55;01:20:04;"[laughter]"
01:20:15;01:20:30;"There's barely any trace of Glenn in that."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"I'm not very into that song."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"I would not even..."
01:20:32;01:20:36;"If I just heard that and I didn't know it was Glenn Frey, I would never know it was"
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Glenn Frey."
01:20:37;01:20:41;"Talking about rappers sampling '80s songs, have you heard the Jay-Z song, ""The City is"

01:20:45;01:20:48;"Maybe we should give it a quick spin."
01:20:48;01:20:53;"That song reminds me of when an indie director gets hired to direct a huge Marvel movie,"

01:22:03;01:22:06;"Did someone sample like Hotel California or anything?"
01:22:06;01:22:10;"Frank Ocean on one of his early mixtapes wrote a whole song over Hotel California."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Oh, I remember that."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"I think we talked about it on the show."

01:26:57;01:27:00;"It depends because there's the people who are popular"

01:27:45;01:27:48;"We didn't have Facebook at that moment."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"We didn't have Facebook to talk about Donnie Darko."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"I would think that would actually create less pressure."

01:30:58;01:30:59;"It also kind of reminds me--"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"not that there's that many of these commercials,"
01:31:01;01:31:05;"but that vibe of, like, a giant corporation apologizing for something"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"and being like, ""We're getting back to basics."""
01:31:07;01:31:08;"You know what I mean?"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Just, like, it could be just, like--"
01:31:10;01:31:14;"Remember there was, like, those weird-ass Facebook ads that were, like--"
01:31:14;01:31:17;"First, it was about friends."

01:31:23;01:31:24;"News."
01:31:24;01:31:29;"But then it was infiltrated by Russian bots and neo-Nazis."

01:31:31;01:31:33;"Anyway, now it's about friends again."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Like, there's a commercial just like that?"
01:31:35;01:31:36;"Wow."
01:31:36;01:31:39;"It was just playing on, like, network television."
01:31:39;01:31:42;"I noticed--this was, like, around the time when we were touring"
01:31:42;01:31:47;"because I remember, like, groggily waking up from, like, a 45-minute nap in Australia."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Just, like, when I first got there and I had to go to this meeting,"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"I was, like, so burned out."
01:31:51;01:31:54;"And just seeing across the street, like, basically in Australia,"
01:31:54;01:31:58;"like halfway around the world, just like a, ""Hey, we're sorry,"" from Facebook."
01:31:58;01:32:01;"It was like a street poster on the streets of Sydney."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"I did not see that in, like--"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"No, they did a whole campaign."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"--street advertising in the United States like that."
01:32:05;01:32:09;"I feel like also the past few years I've caught, like, Coke Industries,"
01:32:09;01:32:10;"like the Coke Brothers--"
01:32:10;01:32:11;"Sure, sure."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"--also known as the Koch Brothers to some,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"basically did these, like, really weird ads where they were kind of like,"

01:32:28;01:32:32;"Yes, Facebook says sorry in its biggest ever ad campaign."

01:32:47;01:32:48;"Not that into Facebook anymore."

01:32:52;01:32:55;"Seems like you didn't like our last ad campaign."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"Came across as entitled, smug--"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"Little cavalier."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"--little cavalier."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"We're here to say sorry."
01:33:04;01:33:05;"Again."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"That's just like a Portlandia sketch."
01:33:08;01:33:11;"It's like over and over again."
01:33:11;01:33:16;"The number two song in '85, Stevie Wonder, ""Part-Time Lover."""
01:33:24;01:33:25;"This is Stevie Wonder?"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"This is confusing me."
01:33:26;01:33:31;"There's, like, another--what's that song with Philip Bailey and Phil Collins?"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Right."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"That's definitely Stevie Wonder."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Oh, yeah, I'm thinking of--"
01:33:46;01:33:50;"[singing]"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"I guess they're different enough."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"That hi-hat's on fire."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"Can't go wrong with Stevie."
01:34:18;01:34:23;"See, he's one of those guys that, like, had huge hits in the '60s, '70s, and '80s,"
01:34:23;01:34:28;"but never felt out of step with the production choices he was making."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"I mean, it all felt, like, true to him."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:32;01:34:37;"The Jefferson Starship was just, like--they just felt, like, not in their skin."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"No, nobody's making fun of Stevie Wonder in the '80s."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Wow, that stuff's awesome."
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Remember on the Cosby Show where he taught America about sampling?"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"I don't, but--"
01:34:45;01:34:50;"Whatever, there's a thing with Stevie Wonder, and he's, like--he brings his, like, sampling keyboard,"
01:34:50;01:34:51;"like this giant--"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Like to the Huxtable household?"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"They come to his studio, and there's, like, some part where he's sampling everybody's voice"
01:34:57;01:35:01;"and pitch-shifting it, and nobody had ever seen anything like that."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"The number two song back in 2018, Halsey."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Haven't heard from her in a while."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"Do you remember who Halsey is?"
01:35:07;01:35:08;"I don't."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"I remember the name."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"I never had anything beyond the name."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"She's a pop singer."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"She's cool. She's from New Jersey, so I'll always ride for her."
01:35:16;01:35:20;"I just wanted to point out that she was briefly in A Star is Born."
01:35:20;01:35:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"Wait, Halsey's in A Star is Born?"
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Brief cameo."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"What part?"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Well, you heard it here first, folks."
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Is that true? Is this a bit--"
01:35:28;01:35:32;"No, it's quick, and it's somewhat inconsequential."
01:35:32;01:35:33;"So I'm not--"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"Does she have a line? Does she play Halsey?"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"I think she does play herself, and I think she has--"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"One line?"
01:35:38;01:35:39;"One quick line."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"This is right before a pivotal scene."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Is this at the Grammys?"
01:35:42;01:35:43;"Yes."
01:35:43;01:35:44;"Okay."
01:35:44;01:35:46;"So in the A Star is Born universe--"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"Here we go."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"[laughter]"
01:35:50;01:35:55;"The A-S-I-B-U."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"A-C-B-U."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Oh, no, the A-C-B-U."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Is A-C-B-U a word?"
01:35:59;01:36:00;"It is now."
01:36:00;01:36:09;"In the A-C-B-U, we are to understand that Lady Gaga, the pop star, does not exist."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"Correct."
01:36:10;01:36:17;"However, her avatar, Ally, exists, as does Halsey."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"I mean, Gaga could exist."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"That's true."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"You know what I like about you?"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"You remind me of, like, a Lady Gaga without all the bullsh--."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"That would be amazing."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"Wait, hold on."
01:36:28;01:36:32;"I was recently shown this, that I guess on her press tour--"
01:36:32;01:36:36;"And by the way, I've always been into Lady Gaga."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"I think she's cool."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"Met her a few times."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I always thought she was super cool."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"She's Italian-American from New York."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"That's a huge plus for me."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Yep."
01:36:46;01:36:49;"And I always thought she was an interesting musician and a great songwriter."
01:36:49;01:36:57;"But with her, she's very Borgesian, similar to, say, Greta Van Fleet or South American writer Borges."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"There's a lot of intertextuality."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"There's a lot of playing with reality."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"There's layers to what she does."
01:37:03;01:37:08;"And I think in some ways, her playing this role in A Star Is Born is classic Borgesian Gaga."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"For sure."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"But so check this out."
01:37:10;01:37:15;"I guess she's clearly been on a huge press tour for the film, along with Bradley Cooper."
01:37:15;01:37:21;"And somebody put this video together that's going through all these different events and interviews."
01:37:21;01:37:26;"There can be a hundred people in the room and 99 don't believe in you."
01:37:26;01:37:30;"But I had this one incredible talent with me."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"She's pointing to Bradley."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"There can be a hundred people in the room and 99 don't believe in you."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"And you just need one to believe in you."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"She points to Bradley there."
01:37:38;01:37:42;"You can have a hundred people in the room that are watching you and 99 don't believe in you."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"So she's got her talking points down."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"And one does, and that was him."
01:37:45;01:37:50;"There can be a hundred people in the room and 99 don't believe, but all it takes is one."
01:37:50;01:37:54;"You know a hundred people can be in a room and 99 don't believe in you."
01:37:54;01:37:58;"And just one person believes in you and it can change everything."
01:37:58;01:38:01;"There can be a hundred people in the room and 99 don't believe in you."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"She's talking to Stephen Colbert now."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"Someone spent the time to edit this together."
01:38:05;01:38:11;"I was thinking about it because some people would look at that and the kind of basic take would be like,"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"""Oh, she's fake."" Saying this over and over again."
01:38:13;01:38:19;"And I was kind of like, well, having certainly not at a Lady Gaga level, but done lots and lots of press,"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"you get asked the same questions over and over again."
01:38:21;01:38:25;"I've never had like a quote like that, that I would say over and over again."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Word for word."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Because I would have been in my head about that."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"I don't know. I'm thinking so many things here."
01:38:30;01:38:37;"One is, is this just classic Lady Gaga on her Greta Van Fleet Borges manipulation of reality,"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"layers of meaning, irony, whatever."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"You mean like she anticipated someone editing that video together?"
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Well, here's the thing."
01:38:44;01:38:50;"It's not like you're taking 40 years of Bill Clinton speeches and being like,"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"""You know, he says the same thing over and over again."""
01:38:52;01:38:55;"This is like within probably a 60-day period."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Sure."
01:38:56;01:39:01;"So it's hard to imagine that she's not aware that she's repeating the same thing over and over again,"
01:39:01;01:39:05;"unless you think she's living in an alternate reality."
01:39:05;01:39:08;"So then my question is, is she just like,"
01:39:08;01:39:12;"""Listen, when people ask you for an interview, they want a good interview."""
01:39:12;01:39:16;"If something-- I go play the same show every night and I put on the same emotion"
01:39:16;01:39:23;"when I'm on one of my famous stadium tours, I'll sing the same ra-ra-oo-la-ma"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"and I'll put the same energy into it."
01:39:26;01:39:29;"Or maybe there's something even more interesting afoot."
01:39:29;01:39:32;"Did she talk about it with Bradley Cooper? He's present at most of these."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"I love the thing about Bradley Cooper observing this."
01:39:35;01:39:39;"He's like, ""You sure like that '100 people in the room' phrase. I mean, it's nice."
01:39:39;01:39:43;"I'm glad I made you feel that way, but where did you come up with that?"""
01:39:43;01:39:45;"She's like, ""Oh, you know, maybe they talk about it."""
01:39:45;01:39:47;"She's like, ""Oh, you know, that's literally how I felt,"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"and I don't think there's any better way to phrase it than that."
01:39:49;01:39:52;"It's memorable that way, so I'm just going to keep saying it."""
01:39:52;01:39:55;"And he's like, ""Okay, I'll act like I heard it the first time."""
01:39:55;01:39:56;"I'm an actor."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Then she says it to him sincerely, privately."
01:39:59;01:40:02;"You know, Bradley and me, and there was 100 people in the room."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Yeah."
01:40:03;01:40:07;"99 of them didn't believe in me, but you did."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Yeah, and he's just like--"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"Yeah, I heard you say that on stage."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"Yeah, I know that."
01:40:11;01:40:15;"Well, I really appreciate that, Stephanie, but I got to say,"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"I think you're being a little too hard on the rest of the crew."
01:40:17;01:40:22;"For you to imply that the caterers, the grips, the set dressers,"
01:40:22;01:40:27;"the camera operators, the script coordinators, the other actors,"
01:40:27;01:40:30;"to imply that Paul Giamatti and Halsey,"
01:40:30;01:40:33;"all 99 of the other people didn't believe in you,"
01:40:33;01:40:36;"I don't know, it seems a bit much."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"I did cast you in the movie."
01:40:37;01:40:41;"I believed in you the most, but I don't think the prop guy"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"didn't believe in you."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Frankly, I don't think he was that invested in the project."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Yeah, when he says something that much,"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"you also start to look at the other side of it."
01:40:49;01:40:53;"You're just like, ""Who are these 99 assholes who didn't believe in Gaga?"""
01:40:53;01:40:57;"Yeah, if a crew person on that movie is watching that interview and is like,"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"""I believed in her."""
01:40:58;01:40:59;"Yeah."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"""I hope she's not talking about me."""
01:41:01;01:41:05;"I would have felt like I was overstepping to compliment her."
01:41:05;01:41:08;"I mean, I was trying to give off a good vibe, but also stay professional."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"Yeah."
01:41:10;01:41:14;"I mean, I was really focused on trying to catch continuity errors."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"Like him emailing her manager."
01:41:16;01:41:20;"""Could you just forward this to her? I just wanted to make sure everything's cool."""
01:41:20;01:41:23;"That said, Gaga's great in the film."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"No, she's cool."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Very earthy in it."
01:41:26;01:41:27;"I liked Ally's music."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"I got to say, when she did that performance on--"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"SNL?"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"Yeah."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"How many spoilers are we--"
01:41:34;01:41:38;"I like when Sam Elliott just wanders into the set of SNL."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Oh, Cart Blast."
01:41:39;01:41:43;"I'm sure it's just easy to wander onto the set of SNL when they're live on TV."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"He's friends with Lauren."
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Famously, SNL doesn't like people filming [expletive] backstage."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Yeah, I'm not surprised by that."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"Where are we?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Here's ""Without Me"" by Halsey."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:56;01:41:59;"[music - ""without me""]"
01:41:59;01:42:03;"(SINGING) When I know you can have 100 people in a room,"
01:42:03;01:42:06;"99 don't believe in you."
01:42:06;01:42:10;"Found you when your heart was broke."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"I filled you up until it overflowed."
01:42:13;01:42:17;"Took it so far to keep you close."
01:42:17;01:42:20;"I was afraid to leave you on your own."
01:42:20;01:42:23;"I said I'd catch you if you fall."
01:42:23;01:42:28;"The track is a breakup song and is speculated to be about her breakup with G-Eazy."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"Did you hear that they broke up, Jake?"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"I didn't."
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Not familiar with G-Eazy either."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"He's a rapper."
01:42:35;01:42:39;"I did hear about the Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande breakup."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"Oh, yeah."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"I was rooting for them."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"Very tapped in on that."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"(SINGING) I know that you up there."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"Deep in the sky."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Does it ever get lonely?"
01:42:48;01:42:51;"Thinking you could live without me."
01:42:51;01:42:55;"Thinking you could live without me."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"Baby, I'm the one who puts you up there."
01:42:58;01:43:02;"And you know why."
01:43:02;01:43:06;"Thinking you could live without me."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Live without me."
01:43:08;01:43:13;"Did you have any feelings when you heard Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande broke up?"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"I don't think so."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"I felt nothing."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"You felt nothing, Seinfeld?"
01:43:17;01:43:18;"Did you feel something?"
01:43:18;01:43:21;"I guess I always root for the underdog."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"OK."
01:43:22;01:43:26;"It was hard for me to understand why they'd want to put all their business on Main Street that way."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Yeah."
01:43:27;01:43:30;"But, you know, she's such a massive pop star, maybe she has no choice."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"You just never want to see the haters win."
01:43:32;01:43:40;"Although then I read a conspiracy theory that actually had broken up, which would be quite Borgesian, if in fact they're still dating."
01:43:40;01:43:44;"That's a good premise for a star is born kind of movie, like sequel."
01:43:44;01:43:47;"A star is born 2, Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"Yeah, just high profile pretending to break up."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"That could be interesting."
01:43:51;01:43:58;"Maybe every edition of the Acibu, rather than continuing to make a star is born over and over again, although that that would be very Borgesian."
01:43:58;01:44:09;"Is if Acibu 2, Ally and Jackson Maine decide to make a movie about their experience and essentially they make the film A Star is Born."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Here's a question."
01:44:10;01:44:16;"In the Acibu, is it canon that the previous versions of A Star is Born exist?"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"Do they ever just like look at each other and just like, look at us."
01:44:19;01:44:23;"We're like Chris Christopherson and Barbra Streisand in that movie."
01:44:23;01:44:25;"I haven't actually seen that movie, Jackson."
01:44:25;01:44:33;"I was thinking more like Judy Garland and George Mason from the 1954 version."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"There's no moments like that?"
01:44:35;01:44:36;"No."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"I think it's implied."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"It's implied Acibu canon, but it's never explicit."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"Is there ever a tip of the hat?"
01:44:41;01:44:45;"Is there ever just like, is there any like a reference to Chris Christopherson or Barbra Streisand?"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"That'd be cool."
01:44:46;01:44:51;"I think after the credits, there's like a Marvel-esque sequence where they do reference."
01:44:51;01:45:00;"I could picture like in Jackson Maine's house him because he's had this like he has this big vinyl collection, which is like a minor plot point."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"It's a big vinyl collection."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Yeah, and it's a minor plot point."
01:45:03;01:45:09;"And I could see like there like a framed like Chris Christopherson like concert poster from like the 70s."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Yeah, just like hiding in the back."
01:45:11;01:45:12;"I could see that."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"They call that an Easter egg."
01:45:14;01:45:19;"The number one song in 1985, also from the Miami Vice soundtrack."
01:45:19;01:45:23;"This is the Miami Vice theme by the synth God."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"I assume it's Yonhammer, but maybe it's Janhammer."
01:45:26;01:45:31;"This was the last instrumental to top the Billboard Hot 100 until a song in 2013."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"You remember what instrumental song topped the chart in 2013?"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"No."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"Harlem Shake by Bauer."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"Although that did have some vocals."
01:45:50;01:45:57;"This kind of sounds like keywords, technology, a sense of unease."
01:45:57;01:46:01;"Industry, the growing dominance of post-war Japan."
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Wow, this is rough."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"Number one."
01:46:22;01:46:23;"How is this number one?"
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Wow."
01:46:24;01:46:27;"I guess people were just so hyped about Miami Vice."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Wow."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Yeah, this is not easy listening."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"This is harsh."
01:46:42;01:46:44;"It's giving me anxiety."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"It's giving me technological anxiety."
01:46:48;01:46:51;"It's also so like a current affair."
01:46:51;01:46:55;"Yeah, it's like a really fake news show."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Oh my God."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Yeah, like just like the really fast credits."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Yeah."
01:47:03;01:47:06;"Anyway, no surprises here."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"The number one song."
01:47:08;01:47:11;"In the shallows, la la la."
01:47:11;01:47:16;"2018, ""Shallow,"" Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper."
01:47:21;01:47:23;"Tell me something."
01:47:38;01:47:41;"I guess there are some Easter eggs."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"And a star is born."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"Yeah."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"There's a Judy Garland homage."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Okay."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"Here we go."
01:48:01;01:48:05;"Every version of ""A Star is Born"" has some kind of thing about eyebrows."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Okay."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"I'm going to pull those eyebrows off. I want to see your real face."
01:48:44;01:48:48;"It's so hard to picture this movie when all I've heard is the music and talked about."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"I just can't picture them like actually talking to each other."
01:48:51;01:48:57;"The beginning of the movie, they really do like a canny job of playing with Gaga's personality."
01:48:57;01:49:01;"Because in the beginning, she's all made up."
01:49:01;01:49:06;"She's performing at a club and she's like has a ton of makeup on."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"And he's just like, ""I want to see the real you."""
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Oh, it's just in the shallow."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"I love shallows, right?"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"The song's called ""Shallow."" I don't think--"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"No, they're just saying shallow."
01:49:40;01:49:42;"We're far from the shallow now."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Oh, the shallows."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"What does that mean? We're far-- whatever."
01:49:49;01:49:53;"You know, I thought it was shallows too. Is that the Mandela effect?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"I guess so."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Where everybody--"
01:49:55;01:49:58;"Well, it's just logical. We're in the shallow."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Shallow is not a noun."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"Yeah."
01:50:01;01:50:04;"And she's talking about being in the deep end."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Right."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"Okay, but deep end implies a pool."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"You don't call the-- shallows would be like in the ocean, right?"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Yeah, there's no S there."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"Shallow now."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"No, I guess you can just call it-- you'd call it the shallow."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"Yeah, it's in the dictionary. An area of the sea, a lake."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"The shallow? Okay."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Can you say the shallows?"
01:50:31;01:50:37;"You know, I think-- because there's that Blake Lively shark movie from a couple years ago, The Shallows."
01:50:37;01:50:38;"You remember that movie?"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"Great reference."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"All it took was the Blake Lively movie to just totally [bleep] us up."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"I've never--"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"I dream for someone like you."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"KC Jojo."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"That's what it makes it-- but there's a lot of cool--"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"Yeah, classic descending chord regression."
01:51:09;01:51:14;"I've never heard shallow used as anything but an adjective."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"It's a noun."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"It's not a thing."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"It's a noun."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"All right, well, technically, but not--"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"But, but, can I go to the pool?"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"Honey, okay, honey, just stay in the shallow."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"The shallow what?"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Just stay in the shallow, honey."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"Yeah, but do that with shallows."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Shallows, shallows, an adjective."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"Stay in the shallows, honey."
01:51:35;01:51:37;"That doesn't sound good."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"[Laughter]"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"You don't ever say either one of those in normal--"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"That's true."
01:51:42;01:51:45;"In a pool, you have the deep end and the shallow end, right?"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"In the shallows."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"It's usually shallows."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Wait, wait, but hold on."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"In a pool, do you even talk about the shallow end?"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"Is that a thing?"
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Yeah."
01:51:55;01:51:56;"You say the shallow end?"
01:51:56;01:51:57;"Yeah."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"Bob, I want to go to the pool."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Okay, honey, stay in the shallow end."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"Really?"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"That sounds right."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"That's a normal thing to say?"
01:52:05;01:52:06;"Yeah."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"That's a normal thing just for Joe Sixpack to say?"
01:52:08;01:52:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"Joe the Plumber would say that because if you stay--"
01:52:11;01:52:12;"You go in the deep end."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I don't know."
01:52:13;01:52:17;"I could imagine maybe a lord or lady saying something like that,"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"but you're telling me that just Joe Schmo would say,"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"""Stay in the shallow end."""
01:52:22;01:52:24;"Well, Joe the Plumber has an above-ground pool."
01:52:24;01:52:25;"[Laughter]"
01:52:25;01:52:26;"There's no--"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"It's all the same."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"It's flat."
01:52:28;01:52:31;"How often do you replace the water in an above-ground pool?"
01:52:31;01:52:32;"Do you leave it?"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"Do you just cover it?"
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Also, do you just fill it up--"
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Yeah, you cover it in the winter."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"Do you just fill it up with a hose,"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"or do you need a specialist to come?"
01:52:38;01:52:39;"I'm pretty sure with a hose."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"Wait, you cover it in the winter so it just freezes?"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"Oh, you probably drain it above ground."
01:52:43;01:52:44;"You're right."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"You drain it."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"People will drain in-ground too."
01:52:47;01:52:50;"Guys, I have to say it."
01:52:50;01:52:51;"This show rules."
01:52:51;01:52:54;"[Laughter]"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"What are you listening to?"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"Oh, this radio show."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"The guy from Vampire Weekend is just idly speculating"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"about whether you drain an in-ground pool."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"The nice thing about an above-ground pool,"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"there's no deep end, there's no shallow end."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"It's all the same level."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"In the above-ground pool."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Oh, I just wanted to say one last thing."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"This is the segment on Time Crisis we call ""One Last Thing,"""
01:53:17;01:53:20;"and it's when I think of one last thing that I want to say"
01:53:20;01:53:23;"that's related to usually the second-to-last thing"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"that we were talking about."
01:53:24;01:53:29;"Recently, I heard a woman refer to herself as a landlady,"
01:53:29;01:53:32;"and I thought for a second, ""Why's it got to be landlady?"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Lady seems kind of diminutive."
01:53:34;01:53:37;"Why can't you be a female landlord?"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"It's not landman."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"Why's it got to be landlady?"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"It's not landguy and landlady."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"What does lord have to do with lady?"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"Oh, my God."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"Lord and lady."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"It tracks."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"It makes perfect sense."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"This is like your own Sebastian."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"What's that guy's name, that comedian?"
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Oh, Sebastian Maniscalo."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"This is your own Sebastian Maniscalo bit."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"I mean, what are you talking about?"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"I'm dropping off a check stained with Chipotle guacamole."
01:54:04;01:54:06;"You're not a lord and lady."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"Give me a break."
01:54:08;01:54:12;"Living in a railroad apartment isn't lord and lady."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"But anyway, that's one last thing."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"Lord and lady."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Also, two days from now--"
01:54:18;01:54:19;"Yeah?"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"Tuesday, November 6th--"
01:54:20;01:54:21;"You got to vote."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"--on election day."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"I already mailed in my ballot."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"Oh, yeah, me too."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"I voted ahead of time."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"I'm going to vote by mail."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"So if you're in, you know, Florida, whatever, get out there and vote."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Texas."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Good lord."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"You got to."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"Get out there."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"Don't sit on your ass."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"I mean, you really got to."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"It's scary out there, man."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"All joking aside, I know this is a fun show."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Oh, yeah, but you got to vote."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"And you know what?"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"On ""Time Crisis,"" we don't get political often,"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"and it's not because we don't believe in politics."
01:54:47;01:54:51;"We're not one of those stars who stays away from politics"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"who are scared of offending people."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"But that said, get out there and vote."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"Vote straight Dem on this one."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"If you're in one of those places where you can, you know, vote."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"I don't know."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Vote for the Socialists."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"I don't know."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"No, but if you're, like, voting in Florida for governor--"
01:55:03;01:55:04;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"--vote for the Dem."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"Andrew-- what's his name?"
01:55:06;01:55:07;"Gillum?"
01:55:07;01:55:08;"Gillum."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"You vote for Stacey Abrams in Georgia."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"You know, one thing I'll say about Stacey Abrams,"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"if she wins, and it's a real tough fight there in Georgia--"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Down to the wire."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"We always talk about, like, not political,"
01:55:17;01:55:18;"but, like, we're so darling."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Down there in Georgia, it's going to be a real tough fight"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"because Georgia has, like, some real gnarly"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"voter suppression issues."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Yeah."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Get this, folks."
01:55:25;01:55:28;"If Stacey Abrams wins in Georgia,"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"first black female governor ever in the United States."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"Wow."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Come on."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"That's wild."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"Anyway."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"Also, one last thing."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"[laughter]"
01:55:38;01:55:42;"This is, like, a whole new way of organizing the show."
01:55:42;01:55:45;"It's like we talk guest top five."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Yeah."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"20 to 30 of last things."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Yeah, what's your one last thing?"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Long dumb road."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Oh, check out long dumb road."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Two big events this month-- election day on Tuesday"
01:55:54;01:55:57;"and then long dumb road on the 16th."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"And one last thing, one final thing."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"Just one--"
01:56:00;01:56:03;"Just one final thing."
01:56:03;01:56:07;"Do you think if you are married to a landlord,"
01:56:07;01:56:11;"even if you don't participate in his lording business,"
01:56:11;01:56:14;"his lording of the land, that you are still a landlady"
01:56:14;01:56:16;"solely by virtue of being married to the landlord"
01:56:16;01:56:19;"and vice versa if you marry--"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Say, Jake, you marry Hannah."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"I did."
01:56:22;01:56:24;"Okay, so one down."
01:56:24;01:56:28;"And she presides over a vast real estate portfolio"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"of various apartment buildings around LA,"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"and that's how she makes her money."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"And commercial real estate."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"And commercial real estate."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"So you married a landlady,"
01:56:37;01:56:41;"but you're still painting, doing radio, playing music."
01:56:41;01:56:44;"I'd be the landlady's husband."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"You wouldn't be a landlord."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"I don't think so. Maybe."
01:56:48;01:56:51;"Well, according to the rules, by marrying a landlady,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"you become a landlord whether or not you participate"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"in the lading of the land."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"And one last thing."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Thanks for listening. Good night."
