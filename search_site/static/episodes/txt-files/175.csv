00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:11;"So much to talk about in this funny old world of ours, and yet there's only three topics that really matter"
00:11;00:14;"this weekend."
00:14;00:17;"And that's pizza,"
00:17;00:20;"water,"
00:20;00:21;"and Kate Bush."
00:21;00:26;"This is a very special Holy Trinity episode of"
00:26;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:33;"Let's begin."
00:41;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
00:57;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know One of us is crying, we're all alone And I don't want it to end"
01:10;01:18;"One of us is lying, one of us is lying We've been only made"
01:18;01:25;"Time Crisis back again. What's up? Another typical low energy start. We always get there."
01:25;01:30;"We don't come out the gate with a lot of heat, but that's how you know we're real. Yep, cold engine."
01:30;01:39;"You're along for the ride with us. Yeah, you can go ahead, skip 45 minutes in. Probably a good idea."
01:40;01:49;"This is how Time Crisis starts. It's a little bit of housekeeping. I was talking with a friend who"
01:49;01:55;"had listened to our fully loaded baked potato episode and I guess we didn't talk about on the"
01:55;02:02;"show that Wendy's used to have baked potatoes. That was like a go-to thing at Wendy's. True."
02:02;02:07;"Do they still have it on the menu? I don't know. I haven't been to Wendy's in like 10 years."
02:07;02:12;"It seems so funny and old-fashioned, like a Wendy's baked potato. That almost, you know,"
02:12;02:17;"it's like when you hear stories about Dunkin Donuts being like a sit-down restaurant or like"
02:17;02:25;"McDonald's having like steak and mashed potatoes in like 1955. Do you guys remember this Seinfeld,"
02:25;02:31;"Nick, that Wendy's had fully loaded baked potatoes? I've had it. So that was like a classic thing."
02:32;02:41;"Yeah, but I had it like three years ago. I feel like for a certain Wendy's customer,"
02:41;02:47;"the baked potato has been sort of a mainstay. It'll be kind of sad if they ever get rid of it"
02:47;02:52;"and then they're just the same as McDonald's and Burger King, just slightly different burgers."
02:52;02:58;"I think the chili and the baked potato are two things that distinguish Wendy's from the rest."
02:58;03:00;"Is Gen Z eating baked potatoes?"
03:00;03:05;"Look, I didn't even bring this up last time, but we eat baked potatoes fairly regularly in our house."
03:05;03:07;"Really? Yeah."
03:07;03:11;"Are they fully loaded? No, I think that they're like semi-loaded."
03:11;03:15;"I think that we'll do maybe a little bit of..."
03:15;03:17;"Sour cream?"
03:17;03:22;"I think we'll do some sour cream, butter, maybe chives. But I think you go"
03:22;03:28;"bacon and you're taking this sort of hearty, healthy dish and you're sort of tipping it into..."
03:28;03:29;"Too decadent."
03:29;03:31;"Yeah. But that being said is..."
03:31;03:33;"I got a question. Here's a question."
03:33;03:38;"I did bite my tongue when everyone said, ""Oh, who does this anymore?"" We do it."
03:38;03:43;"You're living a very traditional lifestyle with your family. You're off the grid,"
03:43;03:51;"no electricity, your son has zero screen time, and you're regularly eating baked potatoes."
03:51;03:54;"He's going to go out into a cruel world."
03:55;03:58;"(laughter)"
03:58;04:00;"Everyone making fun of his baked potato."
04:00;04:07;"I got a question. Is a baked potato a side dish or is it... I guess I can kind of remember back"
04:07;04:11;"in the day it would be an option as a side, but a fully loaded baked potato,"
04:11;04:16;"is that kind of like an entree? Is that a main course? How are you doing it at your house, Nick?"
04:16;04:19;"We're doing... In our house, it will be we're having a baked potato for dinner."
04:19;04:23;"I mean, that would be the dinner maybe with some veggies on the side."
04:23;04:24;"So it's your main course?"
04:24;04:30;"Yeah. I mean, certainly there's an option that when you go to a restaurant,"
04:30;04:36;"you'd get a baked potato, I think, as a side, but that seems crazy. I mean, it's so hearty,"
04:36;04:40;"especially if you're going to get it fully loaded, but you're still talking about a giant potato."
04:40;04:43;"Well, I guess that's also a question. When you know it's baked potato night,"
04:43;04:49;"it's Monday, Wednesday, or Friday at your house, and you're going potato shopping that day,"
04:49;04:53;"you have to go for a pretty big one, like a two-hander."
04:53;05:00;"Yeah. It's a big potato. And it is delicious. It's salt. Honestly, it would be kind of,"
05:00;05:07;"in our house, again, semi-loaded, but I think traditionally you'd bake the potato, ghee butter,"
05:07;05:14;"and some sea salt. And I think that with some veggies is a great meal."
05:14;05:19;"Is that a rare example of a baked potato as a main? Because I can't think of any other"
05:19;05:24;"potato entrees. I feel like it's always, that's the exception."
05:24;05:29;"I think if you had mashed potatoes as your main, that seems psycho."
05:29;05:30;"French fries as your main, that's a-"
05:30;05:35;"Fully loaded mashed potatoes. What if you got some kind of fully loaded fries? Well,"
05:35;05:38;"Seinfeld, a Canadian, could poutine be a main?"
05:38;05:39;"Oh God, yeah."
05:39;05:42;"If it's fully loaded with meat and all that stuff?"
05:42;05:45;"That's like your whole day. You eat that for lunch, and it's just,"
05:45;05:49;"I think you're good for until the next morning. So, yeah."
05:49;05:53;"I'm going to introduce baked potato night in my household. We're bringing back baked potato night."
05:54;05:57;"My baby woke me up this morning"
05:57;06:02;"She said get down that labour exchange"
06:02;06:07;"And if you don't come home with a job, son"
06:07;06:11;"You'll get no dinner today"
06:11;06:18;"You gotta secure me a weekly worthy wage"
06:18;06:22;"You'll get no more empty cooking"
06:23;06:26;"You'll get no more alcohol"
06:26;06:31;"You'll just get those plain hot potatoes"
06:31;06:36;"To satisfy your appetite"
06:36;06:42;"La la la la la la la, potatoes"
06:42;06:47;"Butter, flour, and rye, anyone willing to put it aside"
06:47;06:50;"Hot potato la la la la"
06:51;06:53;"I want you loving"
06:53;06:57;"Every single day"
06:57;07:00;"Jake, when I say that we do this, you don't like this at all."
07:00;07:03;"Like, you wouldn't want a baked potato with a little bit of butter and salt."
07:03;07:05;"You don't think that that would be tasty?"
07:05;07:08;"No, I think it could be good. I think I would need to do like,"
07:08;07:12;"put some hot sauce on there or something. I don't think it would really,"
07:12;07:16;"yeah, because I know what you're saying. I don't want to load it up so it's too caloric."
07:16;07:20;"I wouldn't want to dump a bunch of like cheddar cheese and bacon on it. I mean, I would."
07:20;07:22;"I would want to do that, but I wouldn't do it."
07:22;07:27;"So I think I would do like, hit it with some hot sauce with some butter and salt."
07:27;07:30;"Sounds good. If you have like a nice salad or like a,"
07:30;07:33;"I don't know, like a Brussels sprout or something with like a roasted Brussels sprout with it."
07:33;07:36;"Roast those while you're doing the potato."
07:36;07:40;"I mean, I'm on board, dude. I'm into this TC baked potato night."
07:40;07:41;"Plus an ice cold beer."
07:41;07:48;"Oh yeah, dude. Glass of red wine, maybe? I don't know. We're just, this is getting classy."
07:50;07:54;"My next birthday, I'm going to do a baked potato party. I'm going to hire a baked potato truck."
07:54;07:56;"Everybody comes to."
07:56;07:56;"A truck?"
07:56;07:59;"I'll find the best baked potato truck."
07:59;08:06;"That's the next frontier, dude, of like the, you know, bespoke artisanal food truck scene."
08:06;08:11;"Am I correct that in a late season, Eastbound and Down, the Danny McBride show,"
08:11;08:16;"there was a joke on that show about fixins. Did they open, was it baked potatoes? They"
08:16;08:19;"opened a baked potato kiosk in the mall?"
08:19;08:21;"Damn, dude. I do not remember."
08:21;08:25;"Yeah. Kenny and Steve, I think have a heart to heart where they get into the fixins."
08:25;08:27;"Right."
08:27;08:34;"There's a Mac and cheese truck that parks near my house, sort of. I've never hit it. I'm just"
08:34;08:39;"sort of like Mac and cheese truck. What? Honestly, if I saw a baked potato truck, I'd be like"
08:39;08:41;"much more interested."
08:41;08:46;"Just a real simple baked potato. We can also have some fun with it. I like Nick's vibe of like the"
08:46;08:51;"minimalist baked potato. You know, like there's famously a sign at some kind of slightly more"
08:51;08:59;"traditional uptight sushi restaurants in LA, famously at Sushi Park. There's a sign outside"
08:59;09:05;"that says, before you even walk in, no California rolls, which I think kind of signals a type of"
09:05;09:11;"traditionalism, a type of seriousness. And I think our baked potato truck could have a very"
09:11;09:16;"minimalist design and could have a sign that says, do not ask for fully loaded. And basically you"
09:16;09:25;"have like two options. Number one is the ghee and sea salt baked potato. And number two is like,"
09:25;09:25;"I don't know."
09:25;09:27;"You can add chives."
09:27;09:32;"Yeah. One or two chives. The minimalist baked potato truck."
09:32;09:38;"So in eastbound and down Kenny Powers, he has a restaurant idea called TNT. And he's"
09:38;09:43;"explained it's like a Hooters style restaurant, but with potatoes and he's explaining it to Steve."
09:43;09:46;"And then it gets into the fix. And so they have this sort of back and forth."
09:46;09:54;"There is a baked potato truck in New York, like a food truck called the potato house."
09:54;10:01;"And yeah, I think, I mean, it mainly is sold on, on how fully loaded you can get it. So"
10:01;10:05;"I think we're in new territory. I think there's a whole, there's definitely still a hole in the"
10:05;10:11;"market for this is straight up, very clean, classic, minimalist baked potato."
10:11;10:18;"I can't wait for that New York times profile. Just a kind of elegant photograph of us standing"
10:18;10:26;"together. It says, meet the men who brought, who brought the baked potato to Gen Z."
10:26;10:27;"Is this like,"
10:27;10:35;"Internet radio host pivot into food trucks with their minimalist baked potato. I mean,"
10:35;10:38;"that's it definitely, that sounds real."
10:38;10:46;"Yeah. In an era of keto diets and, you know, general abstention from carbs, these boys"
10:46;10:48;"have turned it around."
10:48;10:53;"So you know how there's like a savory crepe and then there's sweet crepes, like"
10:53;10:58;"are sweet baked potatoes, something we could maybe, you know, experiment with,"
10:58;11:00;"introduce I'm talking jam, barbellades."
11:02;11:07;"All right. I mean, I have two thoughts. One is like, if we did kind of like the trashy"
11:07;11:14;"version that has just like 47 variations. Yeah. A hundred percent. It would just be like,"
11:14;11:27;"number 39, the big boy. This one's loaded with whipped cream, fruit loops, Captain Crunch,"
11:28;11:32;"Hershey's chocolate syrup, and a whole banana."
11:32;11:33;"The potato split."
11:33;11:37;"How about this like acai bowls, except the base is mashed potatoes."
11:37;11:43;"We've scooped out the baked potato. So it's just sort of the skin and it's stuffed with ice cream."
11:43;11:49;"There's something rich and potent about the image of the potato. It feels very now. It feels very"
11:49;11:55;"2022. It feels like what Gen Z is looking for. It feels like what a coalition of Gen X and"
11:55;12:00;"millennial men could definitely get some type of New York times style feature about."
12:00;12:03;"I think this has legs. I think we have to like feel out a few things,"
12:03;12:11;"but I think there's something cool and kind of like, it's old, but it's new. And the one thing"
12:11;12:17;"I'll say is being here in Southern California, it's not exactly a hot weather dish, but I could"
12:17;12:25;"see us rolling up to say a Boston, a Minneapolis, a Toronto, a Montreal, and we're posting up and"
12:25;12:31;"we're just kind of like, it's lunchtime. It's cold. Come have this hot ass baked potato."
12:31;12:34;"Something I like about that."
12:57;13:00;"Did I ever tell you guys, I must've told this story a long time ago, but"
13:00;13:07;"we're in episode 600. So we can repeat. There's a famous place I believe is on route three in New"
13:07;13:13;"Jersey. You always drive past called Pauly Pizza. It's like this little shack on the highway. Pauly"
13:13;13:18;"Pizza. I don't know if it's still there. It's the type of place if you lived in Jersey, you'd drive"
13:18;13:21;"past it a million times. I'd never been there, but I remember my friend telling me about going there"
13:21;13:28;"and people would always say that it was owned by the mob. But as you can imagine, just like in any"
13:28;13:32;"place, people love kind of like organized crime stories. And especially in a place like New Jersey"
13:32;13:42;"that famously has like the Sopranos and stuff, or just the whole New York area, even going back to"
13:42;13:47;"the Godfather and stuff. People love to say stuff like that. Like, ""Oh, you know that garbage truck"
13:47;13:51;"was owned, that picks up stuff. The garbage is owned by the mob."" People always just said stuff"
13:51;13:55;"like that. You never really knew if it was true. And people would always say that Pauly Pizza was"
13:55;14:01;"owned by the mob. It's like, you know, what did I know? But then I did remember sometime after that,"
14:01;14:04;"a friend of mine going. And I was like, ""Oh, so what's the story with that place? What's the vibe?"""
14:04;14:09;"And he said, ""Well, it's just weird. We went in, they seemed a little bit annoyed when I asked"
14:09;14:13;"if they had pepperoni and they said, 'We only got plain pizza.'"" And I just always thought about"
14:13;14:18;"that. Like, maybe it was some kind of front, but just like rolling to a pizza place and they're"
14:18;14:23;"just like angry that you'd asked for the most basic topping. He claimed that the day he walked"
14:23;14:27;"in, they said, ""We got plain. What do you want?"" And they're like, ""All right, I'll have a slice"
14:27;14:32;"of plain."" Yeah, he claimed they only had plain pizza in there. I guess at a pizza place, it"
14:32;14:38;"doesn't cost that much to buy some mushrooms or something. I just wonder if there is something"
14:38;14:42;"cool and elegant and minimalist about a place that really only does one or two items."
14:42;14:47;"I feel like there's a thing of when you're at a fancy pizza restaurant. And if I'm at a fancy"
14:47;14:53;"pizza restaurant with my brother, he'll want to only get the margarita. And his theory is like,"
14:53;14:58;"""Well, I want to test it. I want to see what their baseline is."" When someone suggests getting a"
14:58;15:03;"cheese pizza, it drives me up a wall. I'm like, ""I don't care what their baseline is. Cheese pizza"
15:03;15:09;"is so boring. You got to get some olives on there. Give me something."" What's your go-to pizza?"
15:09;15:17;"I like a sausage olive. Sausage olive? I like a salty pizza, like a pep olive. Yeah, onion."
15:17;15:22;"Just something. But Dave's always very like, ""We got to get the margarita."" I'm just like, ""Why?"
15:23;15:26;"And I feel like there's this thing of if it's a good pizza place,"
15:26;15:32;"the margarita, aka the plane, is going to be amazing."
15:32;15:38;"I mean, that's a very interesting point. And I can see both sides of it. I mean, similar to an art"
15:38;15:45;"in music, there is a school of thought that says, ""Take out all the extraneous elements."" And if..."
15:45;15:48;"People definitely say this about music. It's overproduced."
15:48;15:52;"If it sounds good, picking up an acoustic guitar and just singing it, you got a song right there."
15:53;15:57;"Because you're not hiding behind wacky arrangements or interesting production."
15:57;16:04;"I kind of understand that idea that there's an essence to everything. When you strip everything"
16:04;16:10;"away and you can truly judge the distilled version, and that's where you see the truth of it."
16:10;16:12;"So I kind of see what Dave's saying."
16:12;16:19;"I remember arguing with a buddy of mine, Jason Anderson, when we were in college. And in 1997,"
16:19;16:24;"OK Computer came out. And I was like, ""Dude, this is a step up from The Benz. I really think it is."
16:24;16:29;"This album is incredible."" And he was like, ""Honestly, dude, don't agree, man. The Benz,"
16:29;16:33;"you can play those songs on an acoustic guitar. They hold up the songs. They're classic songs."
16:33;16:37;"A lot of the stuff on OK, you can't really play on the guitar. It's not a classic, true song."""
16:37;16:44;"I was like, ""Dude, you're bringing such a narrow reading of this record. That's such an insanely"
16:44;16:50;"restrictive criteria."" And he was just like, ""Dude, that's just the way it is."" And we never"
16:50;16:54;"got past it. That was the end of our friendship. Anyway, I'm about to order a plain cheese pizza."
16:54;16:57;"You want in? And you're just like, ""I'm taking a walk, man."""
16:57;17:03;"Dude, I can't deal, man. Throw in some green olives and some feta. Give me some chopped red"
17:03;17:06;"onions. Give me something, dude. There's two types of people in this world,"
17:06;17:13;"plain cheese pizza, The Benz types, and OK Computer, sausage and olive types,"
17:13;17:16;"let alone Kid A. Yeah, there you're getting into fennel."
17:16;17:21;"The real artisanal."
17:21;17:25;"When they just drop a handful of arugula on top of the pizza once it's out of the oven."
17:25;17:27;"That's some Kid A."
17:27;17:28;"What about a white pizza?"
17:28;17:29;"Ooh."
17:29;17:30;"Ooh, no?"
17:30;17:31;"Is that an ooh, good or an ooh, no?"
17:31;17:36;"In theory, good, but in practice, it rarely works out."
17:36;17:40;"I was big on white pizza in the mid to late '90s in New Jersey."
17:41;17:44;"Is it just like Alfredo sauce? What is the white?"
17:44;17:48;"No, it's not Alfredo sauce. I think it's ricotta."
17:48;17:49;"Wait, oh, it's just ricotta."
17:49;17:53;"Yeah, ricotta plus mozzarella. And you could put something green on it."
17:53;17:56;"You could have a white spinach pie."
17:56;17:59;"You know, a pesto would go really well on that."
17:59;18:00;"Oh, totally."
18:00;18:04;"I've done that. I've made a pesto ricotta pizza before."
18:04;18:07;"But I think you really are touching on something kind of deep,"
18:07;18:10;"deeper than pizza. I think it's the same with coffee."
18:10;18:10;"Yep."
18:10;18:14;"There's also people who would be like, ""I want to drink a black coffee."""
18:14;18:17;"And somebody else would be like, ""No, but I like the way a little bit of sugar"
18:17;18:21;"and a little bit of almond milk."" And they'll be like, ""No, no, no."
18:21;18:26;"All you're doing is masking the essence and you're covering up for a bad product."""
18:26;18:29;"And I guess it's kind of Dave's argument with the plain pizza"
18:29;18:32;"and Jason Anderson's argument with OK Computer."
18:32;18:37;"He's like, ""Sorry, you strip away all those cool sounds on OK Computer."
18:37;18:39;"What are you left with? Just a bunch of garbage."""

19:54;19:55;"(laughing)"
19:55;19:56;"- Yeah, no more."
19:56;19:58;"We can't go to a pizza restaurant together."
19:58;19:59;"- Is that true?"
19:59;20:01;"You wouldn't order two separate pizzas"

20:09;20:11;"and the pies were such that like,"
20:11;20:13;"we only really needed to get one."
20:13;20:15;"I would try to convince the restaurant to go half,"
20:15;20:17;"you know, half and half."
20:17;20:19;"Like I could put up stuff on my half."
20:19;20:21;"- No, but a high-end restaurant's not gonna do that."
20:21;20:23;"They're gonna laugh you out of there."
20:23;20:26;"You could do that at your local regular spot."
20:26;20:28;"You can't go to a high-end place and say,"
20:28;20:31;"whatever all the names are in Italian and stuff and say,"
20:31;20:32;"- They don't do half."
20:32;20:34;"- Can I get half quattro formaggio"
20:34;20:36;"and half (laughing)"
20:36;20:38;"half posatano bianco?"
20:38;20:40;"Get the (beep) out of here."
20:40;20:42;"- This came up the other day,"
20:42;20:46;"Hannah and I went to a fancy-ish pizza place in Pasadena"
20:46;20:48;"and I tried to do the half move."
20:48;20:49;"- Oh, it literally happened to you?"
20:49;20:51;"- This literally happened like four days ago"
20:51;20:53;"and the server was like, can't do halves."
20:53;20:55;"And I had this, in my head,"
20:55;20:57;"I had a full Larry David moment of like,"
20:57;20:58;"you don't do halves?"
20:58;21:00;"Why don't you do halves?"
21:00;21:01;"What's so hard about a half?"
21:01;21:02;"- Yeah, what's the problem?"
21:02;21:03;"- What's so hard about a half?"
21:03;21:04;"- Can I talk to the chef?"
21:04;21:06;"- So we, you know, we compromised."
21:06;21:08;"We ended up doing a sausage."
21:08;21:09;"- Sausage onion."
21:09;21:10;"(laughing)"
21:10;21:11;"- I love this."
21:11;21:14;"I love your loyalty to sausage as a topic."
21:14;21:16;"- I need something."
21:16;21:18;"A plain pizza, I'm just like, I can't do it."
21:18;21:21;"- You really don't like a margarita?"
21:21;21:22;"- I don't like it, yeah."
21:22;21:25;"I do like a black coffee, but I don't like a margarita."
21:25;21:28;"- That's for the next Mountain Brews,"
21:28;21:30;"the worst margarita of my life."
21:30;21:33;"That's about being forced to eat a plain margarita pizza."
21:33;21:34;"- But hang on a second."
21:34;21:36;"- At some fancy pizza place."
21:36;21:38;"- There's some stuff, there's tomato sauce."
21:38;21:39;"There's like leaves."
21:39;21:40;"- And there's basil often."
21:40;21:41;"- Basil."
21:41;21:42;"- There's flavor."
21:42;21:45;"- There's like one wilted leaf of basil"
21:45;21:46;"on the slice of margarita."
21:46;21:50;"And then there's like the sauce, the dried sauce."
21:50;21:53;"And then there's one like dollop of mozz."
21:53;21:54;"- Yeah."
21:54;21:56;"- And it's sort of just like half the slice"
21:56;21:57;"doesn't even have cheese on it."
21:57;21:59;"So then you just have to kind of just like"
21:59;22:01;"roll it into like a taco and just kind of like"
22:01;22:03;"down the whole thing in two bites."
22:03;22:05;"- Would you prefer to not eat pizza"
22:05;22:07;"than to eat a margarita pizza?"
22:07;22:10;"- I mean, maybe, yeah."
22:10;22:12;"Would I prefer not to eat dinner"
22:12;22:14;"than I would have a margarita?"
22:14;22:15;"- No, not if you're starving,"
22:15;22:17;"but if there was some options."
22:17;22:18;"- If you're with a group of people."
22:18;22:21;"I would get like a pasta or something, you know."
22:21;22:22;"- A sub."
22:22;22:25;"- I would get like an East Coast meatball grinder."
22:25;22:29;"- I could totally see that group of people being like,"
22:29;22:30;"well, there's some allergies and stuff."
22:30;22:33;"Let's just get two plain pies."
22:33;22:34;"And Jake's just like, (beep) it."
22:34;22:36;"I'll get a meatball grinder then."
22:36;22:38;"Okay."
22:38;22:39;"- Yeah, I'm not down."
22:39;22:41;"- I got a question about pizza."
22:41;22:44;"This is a real knock around episode so far."
22:44;22:45;"- I have to ask you guys,"
22:45;22:47;"does this surprise you about Jake?"
22:47;22:52;"Who seems to me, such a back to basics, simple man,"
22:52;22:55;"you know, like a Modelo, black coffee."
22:55;22:56;"- No, but a simple man."
22:56;22:57;"- See, that's a very interesting point"
22:57;22:59;"because yeah, a simple man is often described"
22:59;23:01;"as being meat and potatoes."
23:01;23:03;"What you're talking about,"
23:03;23:05;"there's a difference between a simple man"
23:05;23:10;"and the simplicity favored by the kind of highbrow elite,"
23:10;23:14;"which is kind of a type of minimalist simplicity."
23:14;23:16;"So there is something that makes sense"
23:16;23:19;"about being like a sausage guy."
23:19;23:20;"- Sausage? - It's simple"
23:20;23:21;"and straightforward."
23:21;23:22;"It's not minimalist."
23:22;23:26;"- Yeah, dude, pizza is like a populist food form."
23:26;23:27;"I don't like it when it gets--"
23:27;23:30;"- Minimalism is not populist."
23:30;23:30;"- Yeah, I don't like it when--"
23:30;23:31;"- I'm a regular guy."
23:31;23:32;"I don't need much."
23:32;23:34;"I wanna go home."
23:34;23:35;"I don't wanna have anything on the walls."
23:35;23:38;"I wanna have mid-century Scandinavian furniture."
23:38;23:41;"I want white everything."
23:41;23:44;"I'm a regular guy, okay?"
23:44;23:45;"I'm a regular guy."
23:45;23:47;"- I'll watch an Ingmar Bergman film, okay?"
23:47;23:48;"- I like Ingmar Bergman films."
23:48;23:51;"I don't like highbrow style."
23:51;23:55;"Populism is not minimalist, necessarily."
23:55;23:56;"- And I think it drives me insane"
23:56;24:00;"when there's just like super fancy hamburgers and pizza."
24:00;24:02;"I'm just like, come on."
24:02;24:04;"This has come up before where people have been like,"
24:04;24:05;"oh, you're from Connecticut."
24:05;24:07;"You must think of like New Haven pizza's the best."
24:07;24:09;"And I'm like, it's good."
24:09;24:10;"It's fine."
24:10;24:12;"Pizza, like you're gonna find great pizza"
24:12;24:15;"in every state and every city."
24:15;24:17;"Let's not overthink this."
24:17;24:18;"You put a sausage on a pie."
24:18;24:20;"- I would be remiss if I didn't say"
24:20;24:23;"I tried Chicago deep dish pizza for the first time"
24:23;24:24;"just a couple weeks ago."
24:24;24:25;"- Were you in Chicago?"
24:25;24:27;"- No, no, I was here in Los Angeles."
24:27;24:29;"- Red Baron?"
24:29;24:30;"- I can't remember the, no."
24:30;24:31;"It wasn't there."
24:31;24:32;"It was-"
24:32;24:32;"- No, I'm kidding."
24:32;24:33;"That's a frozen pizza."
24:33;24:34;"- Oh, no."
24:34;24:36;"(laughing)"
24:36;24:39;"It was a Garfield Eats frozen deep dish pizza."
24:39;24:40;"- No, no."
24:40;24:41;"Where were you?"
24:41;24:42;"- It was in Echo Park."
24:42;24:44;"It's like the one spot."
24:44;24:46;"- There's a deep dish place in Echo Park?"
24:46;24:48;"- Yeah, it's like famously deep."
24:48;24:51;"Anyway, long story short, I was not feeling it."
24:51;24:52;"It was like a stew."
24:52;24:54;"- You have like one piece."
24:54;24:56;"A really deep dish, good deep dish can be good."
24:56;24:59;"And as we've discussed a long time ago on this show,"
24:59;25:01;"deep dish is not even necessarily"
25:01;25:03;"the favorite pizza of Chicago."
25:03;25:06;"Remember when we had Nihilist Arby's on?"
25:06;25:09;"And he explained how if you go to your classic"
25:09;25:11;"regular Chicago bar, they're gonna have actually"
25:11;25:13;"a very tasty thin slice."
25:13;25:15;"- Which used to be free."
25:15;25:16;"- Which used to be free."
25:16;25:18;"- He was saying like back, you know, decades ago,"
25:18;25:20;"you go to a bar and there would just be like"
25:20;25:23;"a free kind of thin crust just hanging out."
25:23;25:25;"- Right."
25:25;25:26;"All right, one last thing about pizza,"
25:26;25:28;"'cause this was on my mind a few weeks ago."
25:28;25:31;"I was at a children's party."
25:31;25:34;"I was helping my child eat some pizza."
25:34;25:36;"They were serving kind of like pretty big adult slices."
25:36;25:38;"And I was like, oh, check this out."
25:38;25:41;"Fold it and then it's kind of easier to eat."
25:41;25:43;"And then across the party, I was very happy"
25:43;25:46;"that there was another Jersey dad,"
25:46;25:47;"guy who grew up in Jersey there."
25:47;25:48;"From across the party, saw me doing,"
25:48;25:51;"he was like, all right, Jersey."
25:51;25:52;"And I was like, what?"
25:52;25:54;"And he was like, folding the slice is a Jersey thing."
25:54;25:56;"And I was like, get out of here, really?"
25:56;25:57;"And he's like, I don't know,"
25:57;25:59;"I never seen anybody doing it from anywhere else."
25:59;26:00;"And I was like, really?"
26:00;26:01;"I was like, you grew up folding your slice?"
26:01;26:02;"He's like, yeah, it's a Jersey thing."
26:02;26:03;"- BS. - Anyway."
26:03;26:05;"- Yeah, I take real umbrage with that."
26:05;26:06;"- It's not a Jersey thing."
26:06;26:07;"- That's universal."
26:07;26:09;"- I think it's like an eating pizza thing, right?"
26:09;26:12;"I've never not folded my pizza."
26:12;26:14;"- Yeah, that's really going out on a limb."
26:14;26:16;"- All right, well, Jake, you can't say anything"
26:16;26:17;"'cause you're from greater New Jersey."
26:17;26:19;"You're from the greater New Jersey area."
26:19;26:21;"(laughing)"
26:21;26:25;"- And I guess DC is with, you know, tri-state adjacent."
26:25;26:29;"Maybe people in the Midwest and California don't do that."
26:29;26:30;"- Yeah, see, I don't know."
26:30;26:31;"This doesn't get to the bottom of it"
26:31;26:34;"'cause Jake is actually from the New Jersey area."
26:34;26:35;"And then Nick, you're from DC,"
26:35;26:38;"which is kind of like, you're actually from the city,"
26:38;26:40;"the district of Columbia,"
26:40;26:42;"which is kind of almost like a liminal space"
26:42;26:45;"in that you have people from all over the world"
26:45;26:46;"coming through."
26:46;26:48;"- But also, by the way, that being said,"
26:48;26:50;"the guy was right."
26:50;26:54;"He shouted from across a crowded room, ""Jersey,"""
26:54;26:55;"and he was right."
26:55;26:58;"I mean, I was happy to think of it as being a Jersey thing."
26:58;27:01;"That suddenly took a kind of like mundane moment"
27:01;27:05;"and framed it as the transmission of ancestral knowledge"
27:05;27:06;"from father to son."
27:06;27:08;"- You cross the Hudson River, they're not folding."
27:08;27:11;"(laughing)"
27:11;27:13;"- Well, it definitely seems like a New York thing too."
27:13;27:16;"So maybe it's just back to, it's a tri-state thing."
27:16;27:18;"And then Nick, you know, you grew up down in DC."
27:18;27:21;"You got people from literally all over the world there."
27:21;27:26;"So you got people from Sweden, India, Philippines,"
27:26;27:27;"New Jersey, all coming through."
27:27;27:30;"So you don't know which cultural traditions came from where"
27:30;27:31;"growing up in a place like that."
27:31;27:32;"- You're right, I could have learned it"
27:32;27:35;"from someone from New Jersey."
27:35;27:37;"- Senator Bob Menendez."
27:37;27:43;"Yeah, you had Chris Christie probably coming through"
27:43;27:47;"to go hang out with the powers that be."
27:47;27:50;"Okay, let's just get a quick number crunch."
27:50;27:52;"Folding your pizza, where does that come from?"
27:52;27:53;"- Well, Seinfeld looks at this."
27:53;27:55;"I'm just gonna throw out to Jake"
27:55;27:56;"as someone with a young child,"
27:56;27:57;"you're about to find yourself"
27:57;27:59;"at a lot of children's birthday parties"
27:59;28:02;"where there's gonna be a lot of plain pizza."
28:02;28:03;"- Oh, sure."
28:03;28:04;"Well, I mean, that's not, you know,"
28:04;28:06;"that's you're at a kid's party."
28:06;28:08;"I'm not gonna like make a stink about being a--"
28:08;28:10;"- No, no, I'm not saying you're gonna make a stink about it."
28:10;28:11;"I'm saying you're about to find yourself"
28:11;28:13;"eating a lot of margarita pizza."
28:13;28:16;"- Yep, you know, if I'm at a three-year-old's birthday party,"
28:16;28:17;"I'm gonna--"
28:17;28:18;"- Where are the olives?"
28:18;28:20;"- I'm gonna lower my standards."
28:20;28:22;"- Roger, I just failed to see"
28:22;28:25;"why you can't have a sausage and olive for the grownups."
28:25;28:26;"(laughing)"
28:26;28:28;"I mean, for every kid,"
28:28;28:29;"there's gonna be at least one adult."
28:29;28:31;"The math is not that hard."
28:31;28:35;"For every one plain, you get a sausage and olive."
28:35;28:36;"It's basic party etiquette."
28:36;28:38;"- I mean, this past, speaking of kids,"
28:38;28:40;"this past weekend, our daughter Lizzie"
28:40;28:43;"had her first pizza and her first ice cream cone."
28:43;28:44;"- Whoa."
28:44;28:46;"I mean, did her face just light up?"
28:46;28:48;"- Yeah, the ice cream she was confused with"
28:48;28:50;"and then when it kinda clicked, she was just like,"
28:50;28:52;"""Oh, damn."""
28:52;28:54;"Like soft serve chocolate?"
28:54;28:55;"- Oh, man."
28:55;28:56;"- Get outta here."
28:56;28:59;"- Did she say this changes everything?"
28:59;29:00;"(laughing)"
29:00;29:01;"- In her own way, yeah."
29:01;29:02;"- Okay, okay."
29:02;29:06;"Byla, you can bring a fancy bottle of wine to a restaurant,"
29:06;29:08;"like your own wine."
29:08;29:09;"- Yeah."
29:09;29:10;"- So could you not just bring,"
29:10;29:12;"like, Kit Cary around some nice sausages"
29:12;29:15;"for when the occasion warrants--"
29:15;29:18;"- Ask him to cut it up and throw it on the pizza."
29:18;29:18;"(laughing)"
29:18;29:19;"- That's what I'm saying."
29:19;29:20;"- Could you throw this in the microwave?"
29:20;29:23;"- Oh, you could bring that to a children's party, sure."
29:23;29:25;"- That's what I'm saying, you could have, like, a bolster."

30:13;30:15;"- According to Time Out New York,"
30:15;30:18;"folding pizza dates all the way back to Italy."
30:18;30:19;"And then in America,"
30:19;30:22;"it seems to have originated in New York."
30:22;30:25;"- Okay, thoroughly researched piece by Time Out."
30:25;30:27;"(laughing)"
30:27;30:30;"Totally something you can easily back check."
30:30;30:33;"- Now, if you thought that folding your pizza"
30:33;30:35;"may have originated in France"
30:35;30:38;"and then entered America via North Dakota,"
30:38;30:40;"you'd be sorely mistaken."
30:40;30:43;"It's actually more of an Italy via New York thing."
30:43;30:45;"- Wait, did you guys see that show ""Devs"""
30:45;30:46;"during the pandemic?"
30:46;30:47;"- Oh yeah, I watched ""Devs,"" yeah."
30:47;30:49;"- And there was like Nick Offerman"
30:49;30:52;"and the other like tech dudes were like watching"
30:52;30:54;"like significant advance in human history."
30:54;30:56;"And they were watching like a fuzzy version"
30:56;30:58;"of like Jesus Christ being crucified."
30:58;30:59;"- Oh yeah."
30:59;31:01;"- And then like a fuzzy version of like Marilyn Monroe"
31:01;31:04;"having sex with like Arthur Miller."
31:04;31:06;"Imagine Nick Offerman being like,"
31:06;31:09;"this is the first time someone folded a slice of pizza."
31:09;31:12;"1502, Naples."
31:12;31:15;"And this is the first time someone did it in the US."
31:15;31:17;"1957, Newark, New Jersey."
31:17;31:19;"- Wow, confirmed."
31:19;31:20;"- You know what, maybe it's also,"
31:20;31:21;"it's like a percentage thing"
31:21;31:23;"where of course there's gonna be somebody"
31:23;31:24;"folding it everywhere."
31:24;31:28;"Is it possible that in New Jersey or the New York area,"
31:28;31:31;"it's like seven out of 10 people fold their slice?"
31:31;31:34;"And if you went to Boston, it'd be more like three out of 10."
31:34;31:36;"You think that's possible?"
31:36;31:37;"- No, I think it's just a function of like"
31:37;31:41;"the thickness of the slice and the width of the slice."
31:41;31:43;"And then I think it becomes very intuitive."
31:43;31:46;"If it's a wide thin slice, you're gonna fold."
31:46;31:48;"'Cause otherwise there's no structural integrity."
31:48;31:50;"You fold because it gives you,"
31:50;31:52;"the slice can kind of stand out on its own."
31:52;31:54;"Otherwise it's just gonna flop down."
31:54;31:57;"- An Italian pizza is very thin."
31:57;32:00;"It's much thinner than its American counterpart."
32:00;32:00;"- Right."
32:00;32:03;"- I remember I went to Italy when I was 12"
32:03;32:06;"and there was a very, very paper thin pizza that arrived"
32:06;32:08;"and it had a hard boiled egg just rolling around"
32:08;32:09;"on top of it in the box."
32:10;32:11;"I'll never forget that."
32:11;32:12;"- What are you supposed to do with that?"
32:12;32:14;"You eat the hard boiled egg first?"
32:14;32:17;"- It was a white unsliced hard boiled egg."
32:17;32:20;"I'll never forget the image of that box opening up"
32:20;32:23;"and just that hard boiled egg just sort of rolling around."
32:23;32:24;"- Do you guys eat it?"
32:24;32:25;"- Maybe you go bite for bite."
32:25;32:26;"- I probably didn't eat it."
32:26;32:27;"Yeah, I don't know."
32:27;32:28;"Bite for bite."
32:28;32:30;"- Just a cold hard boiled egg."
32:30;32:32;"Real dry, real mealy."
32:32;32:34;"- But is it sort of like when you get a hard boiled egg"
32:34;32:37;"in like a Korean bibimbap dish"
32:37;32:40;"and you're supposed to maybe break it up and move it around?"
32:40;32:41;"- Probably."
32:41;32:42;"- Do you think that this idea was that"
32:42;32:45;"yeah, you're supposed to cut it and slice it up?"
32:45;32:47;"- There was no explanation given."
32:47;32:49;"There are no instructions."
32:49;32:49;"I could have asked."
32:49;32:52;"I think I was just repulsed by the whole thing."
32:52;32:54;"- Did you or your family just throw it away"
32:54;32:56;"and then eat the pizza?"
32:56;32:57;"- Well, it was my uncle who lives in Italy"
32:57;32:59;"and I think he was very matter of fact."
32:59;33:03;"Like, yeah, that's the standard starter kit pizza thing here"
33:03;33:05;"but it was a long time ago."
33:05;33:07;"- This is either the worst episode of ""Time Crisis"""
33:07;33:08;"or the best."
33:08;33:10;"(laughing)"
33:10;33:15;"- I mean, we've definitely achieved the show rules status."
33:15;33:17;"- Matt's gonna cut this thing down to three minutes."
33:17;33:18;"We also haven't, by the way,"
33:18;33:23;"we didn't even get to the thing we said we were gonna start"
33:23;33:24;"with."
33:24;33:24;"- Let's get to it."
33:24;33:26;"- Hold up, but it's one last thing."
33:26;33:27;"One last pizza thing."
33:27;33:30;"- Another 10 minutes on pizza, don't worry."
33:30;33:32;"- Well, it's just like, after we finish this episode,"
33:32;33:34;"it's gonna talk to our significant others."
33:34;33:36;"How was the show?"
33:36;33:37;"- Good."
33:37;33:38;"- Talked about pizza."
33:38;33:42;"Like, is there something happened recently with pizza?"
33:42;33:45;"No, we just talked about pizza, toppings,"
33:45;33:47;"how you like to eat it."
33:47;33:50;"- Kids parties, folding it."
33:50;33:55;"- Just the most basic stuff about pizza."
33:55;33:57;"Okay, the one thing we haven't talked about on this show,"
33:57;34:00;"which kind of was a major ""Time Crisis""-y event this year,"
34:00;34:04;"is that they brought back the Mexican pizza at Taco Bell."
34:04;34:06;"I don't think we've talked about this at all."
34:06;34:08;"And one of the ways they announced it,"
34:08;34:11;"SideFo, can you double check this?"
34:11;34:13;"'Cause as I say, it doesn't sound true,"
34:13;34:15;"but I'm pretty sure one of the ways they announced it"
34:15;34:19;"was by letting Doja Cat do the honors"
34:19;34:21;"during her Coachella set."
34:21;34:22;"- What the hell?"
34:22;34:23;"- Do the honors."
34:23;34:25;"- And I think, I assume she was the headliner"
34:25;34:29;"'cause she's huge, that in the middle of her Coachella set,"
34:29;34:34;"which, you know, Coachella's become such a major media event."
34:34;34:38;"Like, think about when Beyonce headlined Coachella"
34:38;34:40;"three, four years ago."
34:40;34:41;"It was this major moment,"
34:41;34:43;"millions of people watching at home."
34:43;34:48;"She even released an album and a movie about it."
34:48;34:51;"So it's like, there was a while where headlining Coachella"
34:51;34:55;"felt like this kind of major artistic platform."
34:55;35:00;"And when I heard that Doja Cat announced"
35:00;35:02;"the return of the Mexican pizza during her set,"
35:02;35:04;"I was just like, that rules."
35:04;35:05;"I love this."
35:05;35:08;"This is like fully Andy Warhol (beep)"
35:08;35:10;"Okay, so Seinfeld, first of all, is this true?"
35:10;35:11;"Do I have it slightly wrong?"
35:11;35:12;"- You nailed it."
35:12;35:16;"On April 17th, Doja took the main stage at Coachella"
35:16;35:20;"before the weekend at Swedish House Mafia's headlining set,"
35:20;35:22;"which Jake, you were there for that, right?"
35:22;35:23;"- Okay, so not quite headlining,"
35:23;35:25;"but still a major second from the top."
35:25;35:26;"It's pretty big."
35:26;35:27;"- Right, so during her performance,"
35:27;35:29;"she announced that on May 19th,"
35:29;35:32;"Taco Bell will bring back its Mexican pizza."
35:32;35:35;"A fan favorite item that was discontinued 2020."
35:35;35:37;"The singer dropped the news while singing a snippet"
35:37;35:39;"of an unreleased new song."
35:39;35:43;"She said, ""I brought back the Mexican pizza, by the way,"""
35:43;35:44;"to the crowd."
35:44;35:47;"But I have to say there's some more context on this."
35:47;35:50;"Doja, you know she's an internet troll."
35:50;35:53;"She's been tweeting it at what you call?"
35:53;35:54;"- Taco Bell."
35:54;35:57;"- Thank you, to bring back the Mexican pizza"
35:57;35:59;"since September 3rd, 2020."
35:59;36:02;"And there's been this, and again, it's complicated,"
36:02;36:04;"but I know there's been some TikTok stuff."
36:04;36:06;"Like this has been one of her things."
36:06;36:07;"I don't know if this was organic,"
36:07;36:09;"if she just thought it would be funny,"
36:09;36:12;"and then the marketing geniuses at Taco Bell said,"
36:12;36:14;"""This is lightning in a bottle."""
36:14;36:17;"Or if this was like a long run sort of like,"
36:17;36:20;"you know, slow build to this Coachella moment."
36:20;36:22;"Like this was like a two year contract."
36:22;36:24;"- Wow, I'd be so curious."
36:24;36:26;"Right, because I could really picture either."
36:26;36:29;"Yeah, Doja Cat seems funny."
36:29;36:31;"She could be kind of just like creating her own memes,"
36:31;36:33;"and you could just picture her just hanging out being like,"
36:33;36:35;"""How come they don't have the Mexican pizza anymore?"""
36:35;36:37;"And then just tweeting at Taco Bell."
36:37;36:40;"And then you could picture all the people"
36:40;36:42;"working at Taco Bell social media like,"
36:42;36:45;"""Holy (beep) Doja Cat just tweeted at us."
36:45;36:47;"""They're having an emergency meeting."
36:47;36:48;"""How do we respond?"
36:48;36:49;"""What do we do with this?"""
36:49;36:52;"Somebody makes a presentation at corporate saying,"
36:52;36:53;"""Let's bring it back."""
36:53;36:55;"And maybe it was organic in that sense."
36:55;36:58;"But also in this fake news era,"
36:58;37:01;"it's hard to trust anybody, don't know what's real."
37:01;37:03;"And you could kind of also picture"
37:03;37:05;"somebody at Taco Bell saying,"
37:05;37:07;"""Let's have some fun bringing back the Mexican pizza."
37:07;37:10;"""Let's turn it into a bit of a meme."
37:10;37:11;"""How do we do that?"""
37:11;37:12;"And somebody would say,"
37:12;37:14;"""Let's get like a celebrity or somebody"
37:14;37:18;"""to kind of like organically seed this."""
37:18;37:19;"And somebody's like, ""All right, who's big?"""
37:19;37:21;"And someone's like, ""BTS."""
37:21;37:24;"And they're like, ""Nah, it should be like a solo artist."""
37:24;37:26;"And somebody's like, ""The Weeknd."
37:26;37:28;"""Eh, he's a little too serious."""
37:28;37:31;"All right, somebody more fun."
37:31;37:33;"Maybe like a Katy Perry."
37:33;37:35;"She already has some obligations."
37:35;37:37;"Okay, somebody newer."
37:37;37:38;"Doja Cat."
37:38;37:41;"Everybody looks at each other like, ""(beep) Doja Cat."
37:41;37:42;"""This is a brilliant idea."
37:42;37:44;"""We're gonna bring back the Mexican pizza with Doja Cat."
37:44;37:47;"""Let's kick her a cool 10 million a year"
37:47;37:49;"""for the next few years."""
37:49;37:51;"Does a little tweeting."
37:51;37:53;"Maybe it culminates at Coachella."
37:53;37:54;"I really don't know."
37:54;37:55;"Both are very plausible."
37:55;37:56;"- Katy Perry's wrapped up."
37:56;38:00;"She's doing a promo for Arby's Curly Fries at Coachella."
38:01;38:04;"- Also, didn't Doja Cat did a Pepsi commercial"
38:04;38:07;"for Super Bowl Pepsi commercial?"
38:07;38:08;"Doesn't Pepsi own Taco Bell?"
38:08;38:10;"- That's the same company, Yum Brands."
38:10;38:13;"- I think that's been spot off at this point."
38:13;38:15;"I don't think they're under the same corporate roof."
38:15;38:18;"I think we have audio though of the Doja Cat"
38:18;38:19;"Mexican pizza unveiling."
38:19;38:20;"I'd love to hear it."
38:23;38:28;"- Over the guitar solo."
38:28;38:30;"- It's like mid song."
38:30;38:32;"- Can you play that one more time?"
38:32;38:34;"- I brought back the Mexican pizza."
38:34;38:35;"- Oh, that rolls."
38:38;38:40;"- Sounds like Rage Against the Machine."
38:40;38:43;"(laughing)"
38:43;38:47;"- It kind of sounds like Faith No More or something."
38:47;38:49;"- Oh my God."
38:49;38:53;"I love the idea of your second version of this"
38:53;38:57;"where this is this highly discussed,"
38:57;39:00;"generated, you know, Wieden Kennedy meeting"
39:00;39:01;"with the Taco Bell people."
39:01;39:02;"And they're like, let's get Doja Cat."
39:02;39:03;"Everybody's really excited."
39:03;39:06;"And they're like, it's gonna cost like $20 million."
39:06;39:09;"And then they watch this and they go,"
39:09;39:11;"I bring back the Mexican pizza and that's it."
39:11;39:13;"And they don't know it's gonna go big."
39:13;39:15;"And those who are like, I can't believe"
39:15;39:17;"what we just wasted our (beep) money on."
39:17;39:18;"This is the worst."
39:18;39:20;"You know, if you heard that, you'd be mortified."
39:20;39:21;"- If you're paying for it,"
39:21;39:25;"it needs to be like discreet banter between songs."
39:25;39:27;"- Yeah, no, but you know what's hilarious"
39:27;39:30;"is you could totally picture an actual corporate contract"
39:30;39:31;"where the lawyers are going back and forth"
39:31;39:35;"and it's just like the client will talk"
39:35;39:38;"about the Mexican pizza during their Coachella set."
39:38;39:43;"The client will not do it over any type of loud music,"
39:43;39:45;"guitar solo or not."
39:45;39:48;"There'll be silence in between songs."
39:48;39:50;"Like they might actually get into that stuff."
39:50;39:52;"You didn't fulfill the contract, Doja."
39:52;39:54;"You just yelled it over guitar solo."
39:54;39:56;"You were supposed to solemnly step to the mic"
39:56;40:00;"between two songs and say, hey Coachella,"
40:00;40:03;"just wanna let you know I brought back the Mexican pizza."
40:03;40:04;"Make some (beep) noise."
40:04;40:05;"But I guess it worked anyway."
40:05;40:09;"And just to clarify, the Mexican pizza did come back"
40:09;40:12;"and Taco Bells are now overrun with people"
40:12;40:14;"trying to get their hands on a Mexican pizza?"
40:14;40:15;"- And not only did it come back,"
40:15;40:19;"but you know Dolly Parton got involved in this too, right?"
40:19;40:20;"- Okay, interesting."
40:20;40:22;"What's her role in this?"
40:22;40:23;"- Like many across the nation,"
40:23;40:26;"Dolly Parton has been awaiting the return"
40:26;40:28;"of Taco Bell's Mexican pizza."
40:28;40:31;"She did a video where she ate the pizza on Instagram."
40:31;40:34;"She said, I've been longing for this moment for so long."
40:34;40:35;"It's finally here."
40:35;40:39;"And then she opens a mini pizza box, takes it in,"
40:39;40:43;"and then she said, oh, that looks almost too good to eat,"
40:43;40:44;"but I'm gonna."
40:44;40:48;"So I mean, this Mexican pizza, it's cross-generational."
40:50;40:52;"- Was anybody else involved?"
40:52;40:53;"Did somebody talk about,"
40:53;40:55;"they actually do some market research and said,"
40:55;40:59;"the best type of spokesperson for the Mexican pizza"
40:59;41:01;"will be a female pop star."
41:01;41:03;"And the guys in corporate are just kind of like,"
41:03;41:05;"all right, so you know, somebody young."
41:05;41:06;"It's like, well, that's what's interesting."
41:06;41:08;"We think we should tag team this."
41:08;41:09;"It's gotta be a female pop star,"
41:09;41:11;"but we want somebody from the older generation,"
41:11;41:13;"somebody from the younger."
41:13;41:16;"Okay, so we're thinking Doja Cat and Dolly Parton."
41:16;41:18;"All right, great one-two punch."
41:18;41:20;"That about covers your bases."
41:20;41:21;"- Pretty much."
41:21;41:22;"- And I guess it worked."
41:22;41:25;"- Okay, Taco Bell is owned by Yum! Brands."
41:25;41:26;"- Oh, it is?"
41:26;41:26;"Okay."
41:26;41:28;"- Going down a rabbit hole here."
41:28;41:30;"- It's possible Doja Cat has some sort of overall deal"
41:30;41:34;"with Yum! Brands, where she does a little bit of pizza,"
41:34;41:35;"a little bit of Pepsi."
41:35;41:39;"- In '97, Tricon Global Restaurants bought Taco Bell,"
41:39;41:43;"and then they rebranded in 2002 to become Yum!"

42:30;42:31;"- Part of the reason I was interested in this"
42:31;42:34;"is I talked to somebody a month or two ago"
42:34;42:37;"who went to a Dua Lipa concert,"
42:37;42:40;"and they told me that during the concert,"
42:40;42:42;"there was some sort of commercial."
42:42;42:45;"The way they explained it, I'm only half remembering it,"
42:45;42:49;"but it was not necessarily that Dua Lipa"
42:49;42:52;"went to the mic and said, ""Hey, everybody,"
42:52;42:55;"""as you know, when I'm not singing or dancing,"
42:55;42:57;"""I like to stay in shape,"" and this is like,"
42:57;42:59;"it wasn't like that kind of thing."
42:59;43:02;"But I think maybe the way they described it,"
43:02;43:03;"because it's a big pop show"
43:03;43:04;"and there's many costume changes,"
43:04;43:07;"there might've been a moment when she walked off stage"
43:07;43:10;"and then just like something came on the video screen"
43:10;43:12;"for like a beverage or something like that."
43:12;43:13;"So that was interesting to hear about."
43:13;43:16;"And I was like, and then I heard about the Doja Cat thing."
43:16;43:17;"I was like, ooh, it's like,"
43:17;43:19;"is this like a fun new thing happening?"
43:19;43:21;"Advertising during concerts,"
43:21;43:23;"which obviously would be very TC."
43:23;43:25;"- A fun new thing."
43:25;43:26;"- I'd love to get in on that."
43:26;43:28;"I mean, I don't hate it because I do,"
43:28;43:30;"I like the old fashioned,"
43:30;43:33;"now word from our sponsors type thing."
43:33;43:36;"I feel like I could pull that off on stage,"
43:36;43:39;"just kind of like end a song and just be like,"
43:39;43:41;"start cooking up like a fun little groove"
43:41;43:44;"and just be like, are you looking for an iced tea?"
43:44;43:46;"It's gonna give you some bang for your buck."
43:46;43:49;"Don't forget about 99 cent Arizona iced tea."
43:49;43:51;"I think you could do that in a kind of fun way."
43:51;43:52;"But have you guys heard about this?"
43:52;43:54;"Is this like kind of a growing trend?"
43:54;43:57;"- Well, yeah, when I was at the pavement show two weeks ago,"
43:57;43:58;"it was weird."
43:58;44:00;"Steve Malthus did very little banter,"
44:00;44:03;"but he did a whole thing about Panera bread"
44:03;44:06;"and that how he had like on a day off,"
44:06;44:08;"he had like, it was very organic."
44:08;44:10;"He had just like, they were at like a weird,"
44:10;44:12;"you know, stop and they had to get gas."
44:12;44:14;"And he like ended up in a Panera bread"
44:14;44:16;"and ended up having like a really creative,"
44:16;44:17;"really productive writing session"
44:17;44:20;"on his laptop in a Panera bread."
44:20;44:21;"And I thought it was weird"
44:21;44:23;"and he kept saying Panera bread."
44:23;44:24;"- Panera."
44:24;44:26;"- And now hearing you talk about this,"
44:26;44:27;"I'm wondering if--"
44:27;44:28;"- It's a trend."
44:28;44:29;"- Payroll, I mean."
44:29;44:31;"- Steven Malthus also recited"
44:31;44:35;"the mattdamoncrypto.com commercial line for line,"
44:35;44:38;"got all the middle-aged indie fans"
44:38;44:40;"really (beep) liked about making history"
44:40;44:41;"with their crypto investments."
44:41;44:42;"- It's just the perfect time too."
44:42;44:44;"I mean, crypto is doing great."
44:44;44:46;"- Well, by the dip."
44:46;44:47;"- Well, I think, you know,"
44:47;44:50;"Ezra, when we were at the Pearl Jam show too,"
44:50;44:53;"wasn't there like Eddie Vedder was going kind of off"
44:53;44:54;"about Red Lobster at one point?"
44:54;45:00;"- Eddie really chilled out a lot since the '90s."
45:00;45:01;"He used to just go on and on about that stuff."
45:01;45:02;"But not yet."
45:02;45:04;"- Somehow I ended up on a page"
45:04;45:08;"of discontinued Taco Bell menu items."
45:08;45:08;"- Yeah."
45:08;45:10;"- I'm just going to read some of these."
45:10;45:12;"- The Bell Burger."
45:12;45:13;"- Whoa."
45:13;45:13;"- The Bell Beefer."
45:13;45:16;"- The Bell Burger?"
45:16;45:18;"That was a straight up a hamburger at Taco Bell?"
45:18;45:21;"- Beefy Crunch Burrito, Beefy Melt Burrito,"
45:21;45:23;"Seafood Salad."
45:23;45:24;"- Ooh."
45:24;45:25;"- Volcano Taco."
45:25;45:28;"- I had the Volcano Taco."
45:28;45:29;"I went out of my way to get a Volcano."
45:29;45:31;"That wasn't that long ago."
45:31;45:32;"- Was it shaped like a volcano?"
45:32;45:34;"What makes it a volcano?"
45:34;45:36;"- These don't have discreet Wikipedia pages, Seinfeld,"
45:36;45:39;"so I can't help you just on the fly here."
45:39;45:40;"- I can tell you, I remember it."
45:40;45:44;"It was basically a regular degular Taco Bell hard taco"
45:44;45:48;"with the ground beef, the little stringy yellow cheese,"
45:48;45:52;"the kind of unpleasant lettuce, all that (beep)"
45:52;45:57;"except the taco was red and a little spicy."
45:57;45:59;"That's what made it a Volcano Taco."
45:59;46:05;"- And so you can imagine the Taco Bell Burger"
46:05;46:07;"was more of a sloppy Joe."
46:07;46:09;"- Okay, more of a grinder."
46:09;46:10;"- But that would make sense."
46:10;46:13;"It's using their taco meat."
46:13;46:15;"- Here's something that sounds absolutely insane."
46:15;46:17;"Chicken Caesar Grilled Stuffed Burrito."
46:17;46:19;"You guys remember the grilled-"
46:19;46:21;"- That sounds really good."
46:21;46:22;"- I begged to differ."
46:22;46:23;"- That sounds great."
46:23;46:26;"- Stuffed, spelled S-T-U-F-T."
46:26;46:28;"- Yes, S-T-U-F-T."
46:28;46:30;"- I definitely had some grilled stuffed burritos"
46:30;46:31;"like 20 years ago."
46:31;46:32;"- They weren't bad, right?"
46:32;46:34;"- They were real saucy."
46:34;46:38;"Chipotle Chicken Loaded Griller."
46:38;46:39;"- Wait, fully loaded?"
46:39;46:41;"- God, the names."
46:41;46:46;"- Chipotle Chicken doesn't specify loaded or fully or semi,"
46:46;46:47;"just loaded griller."
46:47;46:50;"The Double Decker Taco was a good one."
46:50;46:50;"- Oh yeah."
46:50;46:53;"- Cool Ranch and Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos."
46:53;46:55;"- Ooh, that sounds good."
46:55;46:57;"- Power Menu Burrito."
46:57;46:58;"- Power Menu."
46:58;47:01;"- And the Double XL Grilled Stuffed Burrito."
47:01;47:03;"- Power Menu, is that for like power brokers,"
47:03;47:08;"like the C-suite, like business types on the go?"
47:08;47:08;"- Yeah."
47:08;47:09;"- Is it like the Arch Deluxe?"
47:09;47:11;"- It's for a power lunch."
47:11;47:11;"- Definitely."
47:11;47:13;"- That's what I'm saying, yeah."
47:13;47:16;"- Oh, I'm sad to see the seven layer's not available anymore."
47:16;47:17;"That was my go-to, the seven layer burrito,"
47:17;47:21;"kind of like, you know, the sort of like veggie burrito."
47:21;47:23;"- Yeah, seven layer was classic."
47:23;47:24;"That was a classic."
47:24;47:25;"- That's real like--"
47:25;47:26;"- '90s, early '90s."
47:26;47:27;"- Or I would say early twos too,"
47:27;47:30;"like touring, like hitting like a Taco Bell"
47:30;47:34;"in like Napa, Idaho, getting that like seven layer"
47:34;47:35;"for like $1.99."
47:35;47:38;"- The seven layer was the Gen X go-to,"
47:38;47:43;"and I remember Primus, they had a hit song in the '90s."
47:43;47:46;"Primus, one of the weirdest bands of all time"
47:46;47:47;"that was ever kind of like mainstream."
47:47;47:50;"- Yeah, I mean, how the hell, man?"
47:50;47:52;"- Primus was truly on some wild (beep)."
47:52;47:54;"Primus has platinum albums."
47:54;47:56;"- Can we listen to some Primus?"
47:56;47:57;"- Well, the song I'm thinking of is"
47:57;47:59;"why known as Big Brown Beaver."
47:59;48:00;"- Uh-huh."
48:00;48:02;"- I kind of remember there being a line in it"
48:02;48:04;"where Les Claypool goes,"
48:04;48:06;"something smells like seven layers,"
48:06;48:08;"that Beaver eats Taco Bell."
48:08;48:10;"- There definitely, of course, that he picked seven layers"
48:10;48:14;"because that was kind of like the funny menu item"
48:14;48:16;"to talk about in the '90s."
48:16;48:21;"- Also, if you're like a poor vegetarian indie rocker,"
48:21;48:23;"not that Les was at that point,"
48:23;48:24;"but you know, he was hip to the scene."
48:24;48:27;"He was hip to the Bay Area punk,"
48:27;48:29;"Gilman Street-based scene."
48:29;48:31;"Dudes were hitting the seven layer."
48:31;48:32;"Matt, throw that on."
48:33;48:35;"- I just want to throw out that"
48:35;48:38;"here's like a really interesting little Taco Bell tidbit"
48:38;48:40;"that Glenn Bell, the founder of Taco Bell,"
48:40;48:43;"invented the crunchy hard taco."
48:43;48:47;"Like when you're making taco Tuesdays for your kid that-"
48:47;48:49;"- Like the old El Paso hard shell?"
48:49;48:51;"- Yeah, he invented that."
48:51;48:52;"- Huh, wow."
48:52;48:54;"- I mean, this definitely doesn't seem traditional."
48:54;48:56;"You just fry it and it hardens."
48:56;48:57;"It's like a chip."
48:57;48:58;"- It is, but it's just like,"
48:58;49:02;"that seems like a fairly important-"
49:02;49:03;"- Yeah."
49:03;49:04;"- Staple of the home."
49:04;49:10;"- Jake, are you a Primus fan?"
49:10;49:11;"- No, man, they were always too-"
49:11;49:14;"I had the sailing on the Caesar cheese record."
49:14;49:16;"- No, I had that and I had Pork Soda,"
49:16;49:18;"which is one of the great album titles."
49:18;49:31;"- That was it."
49:31;49:33;"- Smelled like seven layers."
49:33;49:35;"That beaver eats Taco Bell."
49:35;49:40;"- It's insane this band was so big."
49:40;49:42;"- It's a great story."
49:42;49:44;"It's a real win for the weirdos."
49:44;49:47;"- Yeah, only in the early nineties, man."
49:47;49:50;"- 'Cause Primus is like somewhere in between"
49:50;49:53;"Rage Against the Machine, Fish."
49:53;49:54;"- Ween."
49:54;49:55;"- Ween."
49:55;49:56;"- Cake."
49:56;49:58;"- Zappa."
49:58;49:59;"- Yeah."
49:59;50:01;"- And just like some kind of, yeah, comedy."
50:01;50:03;"- They did the South Park theme."
50:03;50:04;"- Famously, yeah."
50:04;50:09;"- It's perfect for like 13 year old boys in like 1993."
50:09;50:14;"- Matt and Trey said about the South Park song,"
50:14;50:17;"""Best $2,000 I ever spent."""
50:17;50:18;"- Wow."
50:18;50:23;"- The cultural impact of that theme song for $2,000 is wild."
50:23;50:26;"- Now, what was Primus's like biggest song?"
50:26;50:29;"Was it ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""?"
50:29;50:31;"- I feel like it was, yeah."
50:31;50:33;"- Can we throw on ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver""?"
50:33;50:43;"Where's the biggest intersection of the Venn diagram?"
50:43;50:44;"Is it Primus and Ween?"
50:44;50:48;"You think like Tool fans like Primus?"
50:48;50:49;"I mean, this does kind of rule."
50:49;50:50;"This rules."
50:50;50:52;"- I don't think there's actually a lot of crossover"
50:52;50:54;"between Primus and Ween fans."
50:54;50:57;"I think maybe it is a Tool fan on a fun day"
50:57;50:58;"wants to listen to Primus."
50:58;51:01;"- I think it's like a Zappa thing."
51:01;51:02;"- Yeah."
51:02;51:05;"♪ Jerry was a race car driver ♪"
51:05;51:07;"♪ He drove so goddamn fast ♪"
51:07;51:08;"♪ Never did win no checkers, blacks ♪"
51:08;51:11;"♪ But he never did come in last ♪"
51:11;51:12;"♪ Jerry was a race car driver ♪"
51:12;51:13;"♪ He'd say, ""El's on fire"" ♪"
51:13;51:16;"- Primus and Ween played together"
51:16;51:19;"at the 25th anniversary of South Park at Red Rocks."
51:19;51:20;"- That's amazing."
51:23;51:39;"- This is a platinum album."
51:39;51:41;"It's not just like weird."
51:41;51:45;"It's also like, they would get into like very,"
51:45;51:46;"almost like atonal stuff."
51:46;51:49;"Like the chord progressions are crazy."
51:49;51:54;"- It's way less accessible than Fish or Ween."
51:54;51:56;"- Yeah. - I'm so sorry."
51:56;51:57;"So sorry to interrupt."
51:57;52:00;"They didn't play together."
52:00;52:04;"They're going to play on August 9th"
52:04;52:07;"at Red Rocks, Ween and Primus."
52:07;52:10;"- For the 25th anniversary of South Park?"
52:10;52:11;"That's tight."
52:11;52:12;"Wow."
52:12;52:14;"- I mean, that's a gig."
52:14;52:17;"- Someone from TC needs to go get us a scene report."
52:17;52:18;"- Yeah."
52:18;52:19;"Yeah."
52:19;52:22;"Some Denver listener of TC, please go to that show."
52:22;52:23;"Then call in."
52:26;52:34;"- I just wondered how many other like weirdo bands"
52:34;52:36;"in the nineties saw Primus going platinum"
52:36;52:38;"and they were just like,"
52:38;52:41;"""God, we can't even sell 500 records."""
52:41;52:42;"Like, you know what I mean?"
52:42;52:46;"After Primus, there's like a real steep drop off."
52:46;52:46;"- Yeah."
52:50;52:52;"- There was a narrative about Les Claypool"
52:52;52:56;"being this like virtuoso bass player."
52:56;52:57;"- And he is, you know?"
52:57;53:00;"That he, like he'd just be banging this out on stage"
53:00;53:01;"and singing."
53:01;53:02;"- It's a good band name."
53:02;53:03;"- Yeah, great."
53:03;53:04;"- That helps."
53:07;53:15;"- I mean, I guess this is kind of on that like"
53:15;53:20;"Faith No More, Infectious Grooves, like RHCP."
53:20;53:24;"- I don't know about infectious, but yeah."
53:24;53:26;"- Oh no, no, there's a band called Infectious Grooves"
53:26;53:28;"that was kind of like a funky offshoot"
53:28;53:30;"of Suicidal Tendencies."
53:30;53:31;"- Okay."
53:31;53:32;"- That was like metal funk."
53:32;53:33;"- Okay."
53:33;53:35;"- Jake, what do you know about El Sobrante, California,"
53:35;53:37;"where they come from?"
53:37;53:39;"- Is that, that's the Bay Area, right?"
53:39;53:40;"- Yeah, it's Contra Costa County."
53:40;53:41;"- I've heard of it."
53:41;53:42;"I don't, I don't know."
53:42;53:44;"I don't think I, I've probably driven through it."
53:44;53:46;"That's where the band was based."
53:46;53:50;"- Also their album names, 1990 Frizzle Fry,"
53:50;53:53;"91, the aforementioned Sailing the Seas of Cheese,"
53:53;53:57;"93 Pork Soda, very evocative name,"
53:57;53:58;"95 Tales from the Punchbowl."
53:58;54:00;"I think I had Tales from the Punchbowl."
54:00;54:04;"Southbound Peckaderm, this is Southbound Peckaderm."
54:04;54:06;"Then 97, the Brown album."
54:06;54:10;"- Well, that's actually, that's very on point for Ween."
54:10;54:11;"- Right."
54:11;54:12;"- Ween have that live album, Painting the Town Brown,"
54:12;54:15;"and then within the Ween kind of fan mythology,"
54:15;54:17;"it's like Brown sound, like, oh man,"
54:17;54:19;"that's the most like Brown (beep) ever."
54:19;54:22;"- Meaning that it has, when something's very Brown,"
54:22;54:24;"it has the essence of Ween. - It's skanky."
54:24;54:27;"It's just, yeah, it's just like nasty."
54:27;54:30;"Then later on in life, Les Claypool play"
54:30;54:32;"in some other big band."
54:32;54:34;"- You had a super group with Trey Anastasio"
54:34;54:37;"and Stuart Copeland called Oysterhead."
54:37;54:39;"- God."
54:39;54:40;"- Do you remember that?"
54:40;54:42;"- That must've been some terrible music."
54:42;54:43;"- Oh, come on."
54:43;54:44;"- Come on."
54:44;54:46;"- Can we get some Oysterhead on?"
54:48;54:51;"- So what year is this?"
54:51;54:53;"- 2001."
54:53;54:55;"- Oh, wow, so a while ago."
54:57;55:07;"So it's a trio?"
55:07;55:10;"It's Stuart Copeland, Les Claypool, and Trey."
55:10;55:11;"- I believe so."
55:14;55:26;"- Les having some fun with the pedals."

56:53;56:57;"- Just beautiful music, guys."
56:57;56:59;"- Apparently, Oysterhead. - Beautiful music."
56:59;57:00;"- Yeah, it's fun."
57:00;57:02;"- Oysterhead was meant to be a one-off band"
57:02;57:04;"to play at the New Orleans Jazz Fest."
57:04;57:07;"They made an entire set of songs for one show."
57:07;57:09;"Tickets were scalped for over $2,000"

57:14;57:16;"Wow. - Deep."
57:16;57:19;"- You think Les Claypool and Coppola have hung out?"
57:19;57:20;"I mean."
57:20;57:23;"- I feel like if Francis Ford is rolling up to the show,"

57:49;57:51;"""I've kind of moved past primus."""
57:51;57:54;"But Francis was just like, ""No, dude."
57:54;57:56;"""Primus is where it's at."
57:56;57:57;"""I'm staying true."""
57:57;57:59;"- He could also just straight up be friends"
57:59;58:01;"with like Stuart Copeland from just like"
58:01;58:02;"some wild '80s (beep)"
58:02;58:04;"or maybe he's a Phish fan."
58:04;58:08;"Because you could see somebody like Francis Ford Coppola"
58:08;58:10;"kind of came up in the '60s and '70s"
58:10;58:12;"and then sees Phish still out there"
58:12;58:17;"just like playing live music, like guitar-based."
58:17;58:17;"I don't know."
58:17;58:19;"- I think primus is the connection."
58:19;58:20;"That's my theory."
58:20;58:22;"- Interesting."
58:22;58:25;"So maybe primus and Phish have more crossover"
58:25;58:27;"than primus and ween."
58:27;58:28;"- Yeah, I mean, ween just,"
58:28;58:31;"I think ween keeps all those bands"
58:31;58:32;"at a distance a little bit."
58:32;58:33;"- Ween's on their own trip."
58:33;58:36;"Well, I mean, we previously talked about ween"
58:36;58:40;"kind of like taking some shots at Phish"
58:40;58:42;"and then Phish kind of like letting it roll off their back"
58:42;58:46;"and still dropping a 20-minute ""Roses Are Free"""
58:46;58:48;"taking the high road."
58:48;58:48;"- Yeah."
58:48;58:50;"- But such a fascinating sensibility"
58:50;58:54;"that all these bands, they're all very different"
58:54;58:57;"and yet it's kind of like a balance,"
58:57;58:59;"which I appreciate, of kind of like humor"
58:59;59:02;"and like serious musicianship."
59:02;59:04;"I guess that kind of lives on in like"
59:04;59:06;"these like Twitch streamers"
59:06;59:09;"who are kind of like writing songs on the fly,"
59:09;59:10;"like these like kind of incredible"
59:10;59:12;"Berkeley School of Music types"
59:12;59:15;"who also are kind of like riffing and telling jokes."
59:15;59:17;"I don't really know that music."
59:17;59:18;"I see it every once in a while."
59:18;59:20;"Yeah, what were you saying, Seinfeld?"
59:20;59:24;"- Oh, just that the day after the show airs tomorrow,"
59:24;59:27;"the 12th, is Les Claypool Day in Cincinnati."
59:27;59:30;"That was set up by Mayor John Cranley,"
59:30;59:31;"who you know well, Azerai."
59:31;59:33;"- Oh, that's the guy who gave Vampire Weekend"
59:33;59:34;"the key to the city?"
59:34;59:35;"- That's right."
59:35;59:36;"- Oh, really?"
59:36;59:37;"It's our same guy?"
59:37;59:38;"- It's the same guy."
59:38;59:39;"- Wow."
59:39;59:40;"- So he's ahead."
59:40;59:42;"- Shout out to John Cranley."
59:42;59:44;"- Yeah, we gotta get Cranley on the hotline."
59:44;59:46;"- Not a bad idea."
59:46;59:48;"I just hope John Cranley's never hauled before"
59:48;59:51;"some sort of like the Ohio State Legislature"
59:51;59:56;"to just be like, ""Why the (beep) did you spend $300,000"
59:56;59:59;"""to make Les Claypool Day in Cincinnati?"
59:59;01:00:02;"""The man's from El Sobrante, California."""
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- Damn."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"- All right, Primus."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"- So we didn't get to any of the emails,"
01:00:06;01:00:07;"what should we do?"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- All right, here's a cool email."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"To the TC crew."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:00:14;01:00:17;"- Hey there, your recent talk about Snapple"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"being a New York beverage reminded me"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"of the beverage's significance"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"in the '90s sitcom ""Seinfeld."""
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Maybe it's not really a significance"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"as say, cereal is to the show's lexicon,"
01:00:26;01:00:29;"but I do somewhat associate Snapple with Jerry's apartment."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Another thing about Jerry's apartment"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"that really sticks out in my mind"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"is his storing of plastic water bottles in his fridge"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"for regular consumption."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I can think of many instances someone walks"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"into his apartment, heads for the fridge,"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"and takes out a crisp bottle of Poland Springs"
01:00:42;01:00:44;"and cracks it open."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"I always found this very strange."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"I grew up and live in Toronto, Canada,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"and I only ever drank the city's tap water."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"Since Jake and Ezra grew up in the Tri-State area,"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"I'm curious if in the '90s,"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"there was a stigma around drinking tap water,"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"specifically in New York, the NYC area."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Did your parents keep bottled water"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"in the fridge for consumption?"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"Was NYC tap water considered dirty in the '90s?"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Was Jerry's fridge being stocked with bottled water"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"just due to the nature of LA film studio sets?"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"Carefree and lucid, no."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"That is a great point,"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"'cause Seinfeld was majority filmed on an LA soundstage,"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"so not in New York."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"But you know what?"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"I think this gets to a deeper question,"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"which I do think about sometimes,"
01:01:23;01:01:27;"is when did people get so harshed out with tap water?"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"I know it's different in different places,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"but famously, people always say"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"that the New York tap water is great."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"And even when I remember being in New Jersey,"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"I was under the assumption that the tap water was good."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"So yeah, 100% when I was a kid,"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"if I wanted a glass of water,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"I would drink it out of the kitchen sink."
01:01:45;01:01:49;"At some point, I have a memory of my family"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"upgrading to a new fridge"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"that had the water thing in the fridge."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"It felt like kind of a big deal at the time."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"And then I would drink water out of that."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"- But that would still be tap water."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Yeah, maybe there's some type of filter in there."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"But yeah, clearly something changed."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"And I think starting in the late '90s,"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"suddenly everybody had Brita filters."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"And this 100% has crossed my mind before"
01:02:10;01:02:14;"as somebody who's been in a lot of gnarly"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"or busted environments in my life."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Certainly being in college,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"being in some funky studio somewhere, being backstage."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"We've all been in a position"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"where you're kind of at some dirtbag's apartment."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"You want some water, and they pull out"
01:02:30;01:02:34;"just this disgusting Brita pitcher."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Looks like maybe a dog chewed on it."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"It's clearly filthy."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And you know you're supposed to replace"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"that filter every few months."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"And clearly the filter hasn't been replaced in years."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"I mean, this might've been more"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"of an early 2000s phenomenon."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"But I remember just kind of at some point"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"being in kind of just disgusting places,"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"just some gnarly dude's disgusting apartment,"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"dishes piled high in the sink."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Oh, you want some water?"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"And pulling out the disgusting looking Brita."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"And at the time having this feeling of like,"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"oh, okay, great, it's filtered in the Brita."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"But then just like, wait, what is going on?"
01:03:11;01:03:12;"How did I get this in my head"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"that this piece of plastic is somehow providing"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"like a fresher water experience"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"than just like the solid tap water I grew up drinking?"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"And I don't know the answer."
01:03:23;01:03:28;"It's possible that even the nasty Brita was cleaner water."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"But I'm starting to wonder,"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"is this like one of those things you read about"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"when like Nestle goes into some country"
01:03:34;01:03:37;"and convinces healthy breastfeeding women"
01:03:37;01:03:42;"to use their formula for no good reason?"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"'Cause like there is kind of a before and after in my mind"
01:03:46;01:03:50;"where I was just drinking from the tap all the time."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"And then at some point, even like weird nasty people"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"would only drink out of a funky Brita."
01:03:57;01:03:57;"- And then this is even,"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"well, this like the email raises the question"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"that's one step further,"
01:04:00;01:04:04;"which is individualized bottles of water."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"- Yes."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"- Which I remember when that really,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"yeah, maybe like 20 years ago,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"became like almost like a default"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"where like you'd go to people's houses"
01:04:13;01:04:16;"and they'd have like a case of like water,"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"like individualized, like eight ounce bottles of water."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Or like I used to do grocery delivery."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"- That's a real Costco."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"- And I was just like, what is going on?"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I always drank tap water and I still do."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"I don't use a Brita and I don't buy bottled water."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"- Okay, and even in Los Angeles,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"which is not famous for great tap water."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"- I think the water is fine, tastes good to me."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"- It's fine."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"- I fill up my big 40 ounce water bottle"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"in the sink every morning at our house."
01:04:44;01:04:47;"- No Brita, no nothing."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- No."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"- So it does seem like there was some sort of like push"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"from the bottled water companies"
01:04:52;01:04:57;"to make tap water seem unclean."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"By the year 2000, tap water was engaged"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"in a war with bottled water."
01:05:01;01:05:04;"Beverage companies were playing on consumer fears"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"of contamination and illness from tap sources."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"One of the key players in this war was Brita Filters,"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"which further alleges that toilet and tap water"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"came from the same source."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"Come on Brita."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- Whoa."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- Yeah."
01:05:18;01:05:20;"- Did we talk about this ever on the show?"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Like, I mean, yeah, what a moment."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"And I guess the problem is, tap water has no real advocate."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"It's an open goal."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"- It's old school."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"It's an old school public resource."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"- Who's gonna defend the tap water?"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"Bernie Sanders?"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- Yeah."
01:05:37;01:05:41;"I remember in 2008, I did an experiment."
01:05:41;01:05:45;"I went on a five day camping trip out in the desert"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"with my brother and we were, it wasn't like backpacking."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"So we would like, we drove down to Anza Borrego."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"We stayed there for a night."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"We drove over to Joshua Tree."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"We were there."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"We drove over to Death Valley."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"We were there."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"And I was like, okay, picture this is like 1970,"
01:05:58;01:06:02;"like 1971 and we're doing this same trip."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"And like in 1971, I don't think you could like drive"
01:06:05;01:06:09;"into any random gas station and just buy bottled water."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"I don't think that was like a thing that was stocked."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"And so I was like, well, what did people do?"
01:06:14;01:06:17;"They would bring like a gallon jug or water bottles"
01:06:17;01:06:20;"and like fill up at hotels or gas stations."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"So I was like, this is what I'm gonna do."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"I'm not gonna buy any water on this trip."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"And this is 2008."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"And I remember going into an AM PM"
01:06:27;01:06:32;"in the most like desolate, like weird desert intersection."
01:06:32;01:06:35;"And it was like 105 degrees."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"And like you walk in and you get,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"you like the doors part as you walk into the AM PM."
01:06:39;01:06:42;"And there's like that blast of AC, right?"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"And you go and there's like the whole,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"there's the wall of just like the refrigerated beverages,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"Gatorade, Powerade."
01:06:48;01:06:52;"Then like three doors full of like different options"
01:06:52;01:06:53;"for bottled water."
01:06:53;01:06:54;"And I was like, hey, do you guys,"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"I remember going to the cashier and be like,"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"hey, do you guys have like a tap or something"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"I can fill up my gallon jug with?"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"And the guy was like, no."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"And then I was like, okay."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Then I went outside and I went around to the back"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"of the AM PM and I found a hose spigot."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"I took like two empty gallon jugs"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"and just filled up the water bottles"
01:07:13;01:07:17;"with like the like weird AM PM hose spigot water,"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"which was fine."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Didn't taste great."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"And out there in the desert,"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"like it might be kind of like full of weird minerals"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"or something."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"But I was just like, this is insane"
01:07:27;01:07:30;"that you can't just like go to a place,"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"especially in the desert and just get water for free"
01:07:33;01:07:36;"or like fill it up with containers"
01:07:36;01:07:37;"that you have with you in your car."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"- Wow, I love this."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"Jake, this could be like a great documentary"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"'cause people always do this stuff."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"It's getting a little bit played out"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"where somebody is like,"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"we tried to live off the grid for a year."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"We decided to reduce our carbon footprint for a year."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"How about just straight up,"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"I'm just like a regular dude"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"and I'm just trying to just drink tap water for a year."
01:07:57;01:07:57;"- And you're on the road,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"like let's say you're a truck driver"
01:07:59;01:08:03;"and like you're stopping into like the Flying J"
01:08:03;01:08:07;"travel plaza in Gillette, Wyoming."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"- There's always the bathroom."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"If you had been in that position in the AM PM,"
01:08:10;01:08:13;"would you have filled it up in the sink in the bathroom?"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"- Well, but it was hard to get the gallon jug into the sink."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"You could fill up like a smaller amount."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- What about the toilet?"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"'Cause the water comes from the same source."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"- I wouldn't wanna fill up."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"According to Britta,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"you might as well just dunk it in the toilet."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"- Just scoop it up."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"- That's truly next level."
01:08:30;01:08:34;"Sir, there's a man in there filling gallon jugs of water"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"out of the toilet."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"- Honestly, that's like the third act,"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"starting the third act of the movie."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"He's shaking a bottle of tap water."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"- I'm about to do it, man."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"I'm about to do it."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- So thirsty."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"- There's nothing more refreshing"
01:08:47;01:08:52;"than a clean, crisp, clean glass of water"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"on a warm summer's day."
01:08:54;01:08:57;"- That cool refreshing drink."

01:10:04;01:10:07;"'Cause I just, I hate being in that situation"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"of like, you're like two hours into a drive,"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"you're like, ""(beep) damn, I'm thirsty."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"""I've just been drinking coffee all morning."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"""I need to drink water."""
01:10:15;01:10:19;"And then like going in and just buying that like liter"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"of like Poland Springs or whatever."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- Yeah."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"- And then it just, you drink it"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"and then like that bottle's just rattling around"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"in your car for another month and even,"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"then it just goes into the recycling bin."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"It just feels bad."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"I just, buying bottled water feels terrible."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"So when Noam sent this email."
01:10:34;01:10:37;"- It's not cool, but one thing that's interesting to me."
01:10:37;01:10:38;"- It's not cool, man."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- It's not cool, man."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"One thing that's interesting to me"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"is that clearly something changed in the 90s."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"And maybe Jerry was a little bit ahead of the curve."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"He's very, Jerry also famously a bit"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"of like a germaphobe neat freak."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"So you could picture like a Jerry Seinfeld guy,"
01:10:52;01:10:55;"suddenly there's bottled water on the market"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"and Jerry Seinfeld being like,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"""I've been waiting my whole life for this."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"""Oh God, finally, straight from the factory."""
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- Totally."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"- And he probably even liked it"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"that now his guests don't have to touch his glasses."
01:11:07;01:11:09;"That might be appealing to kind of"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"like a germaphobe neat freak."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"But one thing that's interesting to me is that since 2008,"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"and certainly since the 90s,"
01:11:15;01:11:19;"the personal water bottle has exploded."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"- True."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"- So way more people are,"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"share your concern about not wasting plastic bottles."
01:11:24;01:11:28;"So many kids are always walking around with their bottles."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"I can't remember, there's an Adam Sandler bit"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"from like a special he did a few years ago"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"where the whole joke was like,"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"""I get my kids in the car."""
01:11:36;01:11:39;"Their mom says, ""Don't forget the water bottles."""
01:11:39;01:11:42;"And my kids say, ""Daddy, daddy, where's my water bottle?"""
01:11:42;01:11:44;"And I think, ""What the hell?"
01:11:44;01:11:47;"""When I was a kid, I didn't drink water for three days."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"""No one cared."""
01:11:48;01:11:51;"Basically he's doing like an Adam Sandler bit about-"
01:11:51;01:11:52;"- It's true though."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"- Yeah, I guess that's,"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"well, so suddenly everybody's hydration conscious."
01:11:55;01:12:00;"Everybody is also don't waste plastic bottles conscious."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"And yet I think the domino that has not fallen"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"is that all these people walking around"
01:12:05;01:12:09;"with their metal thermoses or their camelbacks,"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"their nalgenes, all that stuff."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Still, if you told them,"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"""Yeah, go around to the back of the AM/PM"
01:12:15;01:12:19;"""and fill her up with the spigot back there,"""
01:12:19;01:12:20;"would not do it."
01:12:20;01:12:23;"And is that because they've been brainwashed"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"by this nefarious Britta campaign?"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Is it because there's a grain of truth?"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"I don't know."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"I mean, I wonder if Jake,"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"if you have a more robust immune system"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"because you've just been raw dog and water"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"for the past 20 years."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"In fact, you never got COVID, did you?"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"- I haven't gotten COVID."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"- Okay, well guys- - Not that I know of."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"- It's very possible I got it."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"- I just concluded a study,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"and based on my findings,"
01:12:45;01:12:48;"100% of the people in the study"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"who've been raw dog and water for the past 20 years"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"have not gotten COVID."
01:12:51;01:12:52;"I think that's pretty interesting."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"- Well, there you go."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- Wow."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"I'm on the website for science,"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"the respected medical journal,"
01:12:59;01:12:59;"which I just read."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"It's actually my homepage."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"- And the respected concept."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"- That's right, yeah, that's true."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Oh, very empirical."
01:13:06;01:13:09;"And apparently from '82 to 2015,"
01:13:09;01:13:12;"somewhere between 9 million and 45 million Americans"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"got drinking water from a source"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"that was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act"
01:13:17;01:13:21;"that was brought to life by the Flint, Michigan crisis."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"They started looking into it."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"- Sure, all right, well that, yeah, clearly out of control."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"- Right, bottom line being that"
01:13:26;01:13:29;"in rural and lower income areas,"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"your water is less safe to drink from the tap"
01:13:31;01:13:35;"because they just don't have the proper filtration system."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"So maybe in a Joshua tree, it's rural for sure,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"so maybe the water is less safe out there."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"But it seems like Brita"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"and the powerful bottled water lobbies,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"the Nestle's and whoever,"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"probably seized on some of that vulnerability"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"and then used that to turn the tide"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"and turn us into a British nation."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"- There's a truth."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"- We know that the Flint, Michigan stuff is true, yes."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"- And in general, I mean,"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"they're used to the fluoride in the water,"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"but I do think that big bottled water"
01:14:03;01:14:06;"certainly leveraged it."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"There is also a taste issue."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"I mean, I think that depending on where you go,"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"you use that hotel tap, you use that AM/PM tap,"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"it doesn't necessarily taste good."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And I think that that's not something you want from your,"
01:14:19;01:14:22;"you really don't want taste from your water."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"- The water in Joshua tree tastes really bad."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"- And Jake, also as an experienced camper,"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"this is real that you can't willy nilly"
01:14:31;01:14:35;"go fill up your Nalgene in every creek and river you come to."
01:14:35;01:14:38;"You're very likely to get Giardia, is that true?"
01:14:38;01:14:43;"- My understanding of it is that if the creek or river"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"has like a nice current to it, you're fine."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"I wouldn't fill up a water bottle in like a really still"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"pond or like a part in the river where-"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"- Still waters run deep."
01:14:53;01:14:54;"- They run deep."
01:14:54;01:14:59;"In the Sierra Nevada, on backpacking trips I've done,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"I've definitely filled up water bottles"
01:15:01;01:15:05;"in a healthily burbling brook and been fine."
01:15:05;01:15:05;"I've never gotten Giardia."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"- Have you thrown like iodine pills or something?"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"- No, I don't."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"- You're talking about raw water."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"- It's raw water, it's snow melt."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"But yeah, if it was like, if there was like an area"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"that had been sort of backed up and there was like"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"a big pool of like pretty still standing water,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"I wouldn't drink out of that."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"- Have you ever just like knelt at a creek"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"and just sipped the water on all fours?"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"- Yes, I have."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"- New study just dropped, people who've gotten on all fours"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"and lapped up creek water have a 0% chance of getting COVID."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"- Jake, just on all fours at the LA river,"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"you're just driving."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"- I haven't done LA river."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"- I mean, Jake Longstreth, American painter,"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"TikToker, naturalist, maverick."
01:15:48;01:15:50;"- Wow."
01:15:50;01:15:51;"- I would love to get to the bottom of this"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"because Sanfo, you said it's very interesting."
01:15:53;01:15:57;"Like, of course we know that there's this kind of crime"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"against humanity happening in a place like Flint, Michigan,"
01:15:59;01:16:02;"where just this large population of people"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"being ignored by the government,"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"having something went totally wrong"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"with their infrastructure there."
01:16:07;01:16:09;"And there's bad water and you think about"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"how much we rely on water for everything."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"But then the question is,"
01:16:13;01:16:16;"is that like reporting some horrific crime"
01:16:16;01:16:20;"in a city of 10 million people"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"and making everybody like super paranoid,"
01:16:23;01:16:26;"even though the vast majority of people should be cautious,"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"but go about their lives in a healthy way."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"And is it ratcheting up the anxiety?"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"I really don't know."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"I mean, the numbers you're talking about,"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"nine to 45 million, that's a lot of Americans."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"It's still, if it's 9 million,"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"you are talking about less than 10%."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"And obviously that would really depend on where you are."
01:16:43;01:16:46;"So I guess, 'cause I get the impression"
01:16:46;01:16:47;"around a lot of people that I know"
01:16:47;01:16:49;"that they don't look at it like,"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"whenever I go to a new place,"
01:16:51;01:16:54;"I like to double check that I'm not in some sort of like"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"red zone where there's something horrible"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"happening to the water."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"In fact, it's almost more like wherever I am,"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"I don't drink tap water."
01:17:00;01:17:03;"That's what happened to many people."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"I don't know if these are more like,"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"if these are more like upper middle class types"
01:17:07;01:17:11;"who wanna buy the Fiji water to begin with."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"I don't know, but there's, but clearly something,"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"the anti-tap water machine won big, I think."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"- So if you come over to my house,"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"there's, you have the sink, the regular tap water,"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"and right next is a little filtered water tap."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- Sure."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"- Are you just going for the tap water?"
01:17:31;01:17:31;"Or will you drink--"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"- Oh, when you have the choice."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"- No, I mean, I'll do the filtered."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"If someone's like, ""Oh, that's the filter tap."""
01:17:36;01:17:37;"I'm like, ""Okay, I'll do that."""
01:17:37;01:17:41;"- When Jake does that, he gets his first cold in four years"
01:17:41;01:17:42;"later that week."
01:17:42;01:17:42;"(laughing)"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"I was recently in a hotel in Denver."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"I think I drank a little bit of tap water"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"'cause there was no more like bottled water in the room."
01:17:50;01:17:53;"There was a tiny bit of anxiety like put into me"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"that's like, ""Oh, you don't know what you're dealing with."""
01:17:55;01:17:56;"- So let me get a number crunch."
01:17:56;01:17:58;"How's Denver tap water?"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"- Yeah, I'll crunch that, but I also have to speculate"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"that Colorado was natural mountains."
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Beautiful mountains."
01:18:05;01:18:08;"- Yeah, snow melt exactly."
01:18:08;01:18:09;"Feels like a more pure--"
01:18:09;01:18:10;"- Yeah, should be."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"You'd think it'd be great."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"- Well, a number crunch is, Jake, you walk into my house,"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"it's 102 degrees outside."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"Hot all to the end of the day."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"You're so thirsty."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"You pass by a sink, it's just regular tap water,"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"and I go, ""Well, if you want the filtered,"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"""it's in the other room."""
01:18:24;01:18:26;"It's just a couple steps away."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"What are you like, ""I'm just gonna drink"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"""out of the tap water."""
01:18:28;01:18:29;"- Yeah, I'll do tap."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Just throw some ice cubes in there."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"- By the way, that's a whole other thing."
01:18:32;01:18:36;"Drinking filtered water, but your ice cubes--"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- Are tap."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- Are tap."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"I think that happens more often than people wanna admit."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"- That is true."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"This is the original Hygiene Theater, folks."
01:18:45;01:18:50;"This disgusting, just busted ass old Brita."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"- And the irony obviously being in,"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"and there's a lot of people online"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"that would agree with this,"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"that I found is that the irony being"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"is that that Brita is significantly worse for you"
01:19:00;01:19:01;"than the tap water."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"- Because of the plastic?"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"- Well, if you haven't cleaned the filter,"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"there's mold, there's just so many other things"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"that you don't even get out of the tap"
01:19:09;01:19:13;"that the irony being you're much better off."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"- Unintended consequences."
01:19:15;01:19:16;"Right."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"I also wonder, is it possible that everybody"
01:19:18;01:19:22;"putting their water through these plastic filters"
01:19:22;01:19:27;"increased some other kind of rates of disease or problems?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"Can't win."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"- Listen, you're in luck, Ezra."
01:19:31;01:19:35;"The snow melt, snow melt is a big component"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"of Denver's drinking water."
01:19:36;01:19:41;"They've got pristine water sourced from 100% surface water"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"that comes from river streams and reservoirs."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"High quality mountain snow."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"2018, their water was tested by the EPA"
01:19:49;01:19:54;"and it had a very low PFAS content."
01:19:54;01:20:00;"Now PFAS is per and polyfluoroacryl substances."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"- PF Changs."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"- Right, PF Changs water."
01:20:04;01:20:07;"- Concentration of PF Changs ingredients."
01:20:07;01:20:10;"- So the group of chemicals, PFAS,"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"which is used to make carpet, clothing,"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"furniture and cookware,"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"those were found at very, very low levels in Denver."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"- The dreaded microplastics, folks."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"- Sure."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"- Oh God."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"- Of which we all have microplastics"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"coursing through our veins right now."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"- Good Lord."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Well, I'm happy to report that so far"
01:20:28;01:20:33;"this episode has been about pizza and water."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"- The basics."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"- Just the basics."
01:20:35;01:20:39;"- I was having this, while we were talking about it,"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"just thinking about that image of Jake in a pizza place"
01:20:42;01:20:45;"eating that sausage and olive and just downing it"
01:20:45;01:20:48;"with just a big, one of those big plastic red cups"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"of tap water."
01:20:50;01:20:56;"Water out of the Coca-Cola fountain machine."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"- I've noticed in the recent years"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"that there's restaurants where they say,"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"oh, can I get you some water?"
01:21:02;01:21:06;"We have still sparkling or filtered tap."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"That's become a thing 'cause we got still and sparkling"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"if you want to buy the fancy bottle,"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"but we also have filtered tap."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"But I love the idea of Jake going like,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"how about just regular tap?"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"- Just straight tap."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"- Jesus Christ."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"How about regular tap?"
01:21:21;01:21:22;"- I don't care if you have to go to the bathroom"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"to fill it up."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"- Yeah, you got a spigot?"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Where's your spigot?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- Yeah."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"- We could do filtered tap, sir."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"All right."
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Here's 20 bucks."
01:21:31;01:21:34;"Go around the back of the AM, PM, across the street."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"- There's a spigot over by that dumpster."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"- I'm fine with hose water."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"If you get anybody out back watering."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"- I mean, I feel like as a kid,"
01:21:45;01:21:48;"I was taking down a decent amount of hose water."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"- Oh, definitely."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"It's a rite of passage."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"- Let's get a water scientist on the next episode"
01:21:53;01:21:55;"to really dig into this."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"(gentle music)"

01:22:55;01:22:56;"in the music game a little bit."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"- That's right."
01:22:57;01:23:01;"- Now, was that the first Mountain Brews show ever"
01:23:01;01:23:02;"the other day? - Yes."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"- Wow."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"- First Mountain Brews show ever."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- You guys sounded great."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"It was a great vibe."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"- Thank you."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"I'm glad you made it."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"- Oh yeah, I was psyched."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"Now, interesting, first Mountain Brews show,"
01:23:13;01:23:17;"it was kind of at a backyard barbecue."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"- Yep, Memorial Day weekend."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"- Lot of kids running around."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"- Yeah, I think half the audience"
01:23:22;01:23:25;"was children under the age of five."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"(laughing)"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"- Checking out their first Brews show."
01:23:29;01:23:29;"- Yeah."
01:23:29;01:23:30;"- And actually, the sound was really good."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"I told you after the show,"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"I was really impressed by the little PA."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Did you bring that or that was--"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"- No, that was a friend of the show, Alex."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Alex Gordelis, that was his house."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"And his Neil Young cover band played."
01:23:42;01:23:43;"And then--"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"- Cinnamon Boys."
01:23:44;01:23:47;"- And then he had this little PA that he said was"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"generally meant for corporate conferences."
01:23:50;01:23:54;"- But it really sounded good 'cause like,"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"I don't know, like my memories are kind of like playing"
01:23:56;01:24:00;"backyard shows in the 90s, a lot of feedback,"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"just hard to get the levels right."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"It's like a very solid, good sounding PA."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- Love to hear it."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"I remember asking the audience after multiple songs,"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"how's the mix?"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"- It was a good mix."
01:24:12;01:24:14;"- And then we got our next show,"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Busy Summer for Mountain Brews."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"We got our next show with Taper's Choice."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"- Oh, I've heard about this show."
01:24:18;01:24:23;"- June 18th in LA at the Spoke Bicycle Cafe in Frogtown."
01:24:23;01:24:28;"- Are you gonna switch up the set list for that show?"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Because it was a tight set list."
01:24:30;01:24:35;"Interestingly, there's no worse margarita on the set list."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"- Kind of slow."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- Yeah."
01:24:38;01:24:38;"- We don't have enough time."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"I think we're doing more or less the same set list."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"Probably different sequence."
01:24:43;01:24:46;"- You know what song really sounded great was Spring Wind."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"- Oh really?"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"That sounded good to you?"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"- I thought it sounded really good."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"- Okay, cool."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"I thought that was really shaky."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"I'm glad to hear that."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"- No, I enjoyed it."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"I mean, there's also just a cool moment in the set"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"getting a little reggae."
01:24:56;01:25:01;"- Well, the next show we're gonna have"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Tim Ramsey on keyboards."
01:25:02;01:25:05;"We're gonna have a seven piece version of Mountain Brews."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"We're gonna have two keyboards."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"We'll have Casey Johansson singing"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"on most of the songs with us too."
01:25:11;01:25:15;"'Cause she sings like in Raised in a Place."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"♪ So far away from here ♪"
01:25:17;01:25:20;"And she sings on Spring Wind."
01:25:20;01:25:23;"- I love the live intro to Raised in a Place."
01:25:23;01:25:26;"Each member of the band goes around, says their name"
01:25:26;01:25:27;"and where they were raised."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"(laughing)"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"- That was impromptu."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- That was impromptu, really?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"- Yeah."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"- And then at the end, I think Jakey said like,"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"I'm Jake from Connecticut."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"I was raised in Connecticut."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"And then you say like, we were all raised in a place"
01:25:40;01:25:40;"or something."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"Then just kick right in."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"- I wanna work out some like kind of dumb ass"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"like Springsteen thing of just like,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"you know, we used to go down to the pumpkin patch"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"every fall for the fall harvest."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"And when we went down there"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"and there was nothing but a big parking lot"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"with a Blockbuster video on one side"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"and a Starbucks in the other."
01:26:00;01:26:04;"Just like, like right in the middle of the song."
01:26:04;01:26:07;"Do something like overly long Raised in a Place monologue."
01:26:07;01:26:10;"- One day I went back to my local Taco Bell."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"They looked me dead in the eye and said,"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"no, I'm sorry, son."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"The Mexican pizza's gone."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"It's not on the menu anymore."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"You know, the manager said it was up to me."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"(laughing)"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"It's still on the seven layer,"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"but it came down from on high."
01:26:27;01:26:30;"Anyway, I was just saying, you know,"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"the last show I played was Richard Pictures"
01:26:33;01:26:38;"at Hollywood Bowl opening for Vampire, October of 2019."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"- That was the last show you did, period."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"- That was the last show I played,"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"a live rock show that I played."
01:26:44;01:26:47;"And yeah, the Mountain Brew show at Alex's house"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"was the first show I played emerging out of the pandemic."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"- Whoa."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"- We got some Richard Pictures on the books"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"for this fall at the Old Town Pub in Pasadena."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Hopefully do a Mountain Brew's record release show"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"'cause we're gonna put out some vinyl in the fall."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"- Oh yeah, that's exciting."
01:27:02;01:27:07;"- Things are cooking on a very low key back burner way."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Hobby rock sort of way."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"- Any new Mountain Brew's music to look forward to?"
01:27:11;01:27:14;"- Yeah, we were playing a new one called I'm Over It."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"We played that at the show."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"I haven't recorded."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"I mean, yeah, I don't know."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"I gotta find the time."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"But yeah, we'd love to record."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Maybe later in the year we will."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"What's going on with you?"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"- Well, been working on Vampire,"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"as always, slowly but surely."
01:27:30;01:27:33;"- Great. - With some significant breaks."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"We're in there."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"It's really getting there."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"Some very strong material."
01:27:36;01:27:38;"- LP5."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- We're doing some little shows here and there."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"I mean, our last big show was last year,"
01:27:41;01:27:46;"our one show of 2021, that SF Festival, Outside Lands."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"- Yeah."
01:27:47;01:27:52;"- We done a couple private gigs helping us get back in."
01:27:52;01:27:56;"And then coming up, we got a bunch of fun, new festivals."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"Heading back to, well, I guess when this airs,"
01:27:59;01:28:02;"in Indianapolis this weekend, last night."
01:28:02;01:28:03;"- A festival."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"- Yeah, a new festival."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"- Wow. - And then, you know,"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"there's like a bunch this summer."
01:28:08;01:28:13;"This summer, we basically have five shows."
01:28:13;01:28:17;"Indianapolis, Cleveland, Gonzales, Texas."
01:28:17;01:28:18;"- Tight locations."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"- Japan, Korea."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"- Whoa."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- That's the Vampire Weekend 22 tour."
01:28:23;01:28:26;"Wouldn't have it any other way."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"So anyway, we got that going on."
01:28:27;01:28:30;"But one thing that I kind of forgot about,"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"'cause I played a very small role"
01:28:32;01:28:35;"in this new Liam Gallagher album."
01:28:35;01:28:36;"And actually, I don't know if I've heard"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"like the fully mixed and mastered song."
01:28:38;01:28:39;"- Insane."
01:28:39;01:28:43;"- But basically, a buddy of mine, Andrew Wyatt,"
01:28:43;01:28:46;"great musician, he's got the band Mike Snow,"
01:28:46;01:28:49;"and he's also a very accomplished producer and songwriter."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"He, we were just like catching up,"
01:28:51;01:28:54;"and he was like working on, he's worked a lot with Liam."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"And I guess at this point, Liam's dropped a few solo albums."
01:28:57;01:29:00;"And he was working on his new one."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"He was like, yeah, you know, we're just like,"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"a bunch of different people are working on it."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"If you have any song ideas, let me know."
01:29:06;01:29:09;"And it's never been something I've been like passionate"
01:29:09;01:29:14;"about, like trying to write songs with or for other people."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"There've been a handful of times in my life, you know,"
01:29:16;01:29:20;"like that Beyonce song, like a demo I worked on"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"just kind of ends up somewhere."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"That's cool when it happens."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"But like generally speaking, I just feel like,"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"I don't know, I'm just always kind of like thinking about,"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"it's enough work just to think about like"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"Vampire Weekend stuff."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"I don't know if on command, I can just like sit down"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"and write a song for somebody else."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"But you know, every once in a while an idea comes."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"So I just sat at the piano, and of course, like,"
01:29:39;01:29:42;"you know, Oasis rules and he's such a legend."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"So I was like, do I have any ideas?"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"And at first I was like, no."
01:29:44;01:29:47;"And then I sat down at the piano and I started writing this"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"kind of like climbing chord progression."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"And I wrote this kind of like song with a significant"
01:29:53;01:29:57;"kind of Cold War aesthetic."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"And this was like a few years ago."
01:29:58;01:30:00;"So it has absolutely nothing to do with the Russia,"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Ukraine conflict."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"But I'd also recently learned this phrase"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"that was a Cold War era phrase, Moscow rules,"
01:30:08;01:30:13;"which is a series of rules that like undercover agents"
01:30:13;01:30:17;"working in the East Block during the Cold War"
01:30:17;01:30:19;"would adhere to."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"So I'm like, you want to pull up the actual Moscow rules?"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"It's basically on some like, you can't trust anyone."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"Always assume the opposition is watching,"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"that kind of stuff."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"And I was struck by that phrase, Moscow rules."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"So I was like, oh, that's kind of like an interesting"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"metaphor for a song."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"Anyway, end up working on it, working on it with Liam,"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"becomes like a real song."
01:30:37;01:30:42;"It's a track on his album, which came out recently."
01:30:42;01:30:46;"My buddy Andrew told me it went to number one in the UK."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"First UK number one I've ever been a part of."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Vampire Weekend clocked in at number two,"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"I believe on our last album, never got the top slot."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"But yeah, it was fun working on it."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"And you know, I played some instruments."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"I randomly played some saxophone and--"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"- Vocals?"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"- No vocals, I'm not a feature."
01:31:03;01:31:07;"I'm a co-producer and co-writer on this song."
01:31:07;01:31:10;"- Can I just read you the Moscow rules real fast?"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"- Oh, the actual Moscow rules?"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"Yeah, please."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"- Yeah, assume nothing."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Never go against your gut."
01:31:15;01:31:18;"Everyone is potentially under opposition control."
01:31:18;01:31:21;"Do not look back, you are never completely alone."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"Go with the flow, blend in."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Vary your pattern and stay within your cover."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"Lull them into a sense of complacency."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Do not harass the opposition."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"Pick the time and place for action."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Keep your options open."
01:31:35;01:31:39;"- That's just solid advice in any moment in time."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"- Never go against your gut is a good one."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- Yeah, anyway, let's throw it on."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"I wanna play this for you guys."
01:31:44;01:31:46;"Liam Gallagher, ""Moscow Rules."""

01:36:10;01:36:12;"- And he's also just like such a cool dude."
01:36:12;01:36:16;"Like he really is like exactly what you'd want him to be."
01:36:16;01:36:19;"- How much time did you spend together?"
01:36:19;01:36:22;"- You know, like a couple hours here, a couple hours there,"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"not like a ton, but enough to just like, you know,"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"chat and hang out."
01:36:27;01:36:32;"He's just like so naturally funny and kind of like charming,"
01:36:32;01:36:35;"like exactly, kind of like exactly what you see"
01:36:35;01:36:36;"in like an interview."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"I guess it's true of his brother too."
01:36:38;01:36:41;"They both just like have this kind of just like way"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"with words."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"I guess it's like a very English thing."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"You know, when you just meet somebody,"
01:36:46;01:36:47;"just kind of everything they say,"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"they just got a way with words."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"Like, so I just remember even just making small talk"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"and I don't know if this is like a,"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"maybe this is something he says all the time,"
01:36:53;01:36:56;"but still just like, I was just like so charmed"
01:36:56;01:36:57;"and struck by him."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"I just thought he was so funny and cool."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Like at one point, just kind of talking,"
01:37:00;01:37:03;"we were in a studio in London and I was like,"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"so like obviously you're from Manchester,"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"like, but you live in London."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"I was like, yeah, yeah, I live in London."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"I was like, how long you been down here?"
01:37:10;01:37:13;"And he was like, oh man, you know, long time."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"I'm sorry, I'm going to do like really bad accent,"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"but I can't do it in an American accent."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"And then he just starts talking about,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"move down here to London."
01:37:19;01:37:22;"God, all the buildings, so bright."
01:37:22;01:37:25;"Why I had to wear me sunglasses just to nip down"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"to the grocery store or whatever."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Just like these little things like that."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Just like the buildings are so white."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"I had to put on me sunglasses."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Just like all these like funny little things."
01:37:35;01:37:38;"Every like story he told was just like so funny."
01:37:38;01:37:41;"Anyway, that was pretty tight."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"- The other week, you know, it was my first travel"
01:37:43;01:37:46;"in a very long time since pre-COVID, you know."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"And I was flying in the flight attendant"
01:37:49;01:37:52;"who, story for another time,"
01:37:52;01:37:55;"called himself the Keith Richards of flight attendants."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"(laughing)"
01:37:57;01:37:58;"- Hell yeah."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"- He really loved this guy."
01:37:59;01:38:04;"I mean, he really made this flight just so entertaining."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"But he was telling me, we were flying from London"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"and it's sort of a regular route of his"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"and he spends a lot of time there."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"I don't know, it's not even that long ago,"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"maybe six years ago or so."
01:38:14;01:38:19;"He was in sort of a local pub outside of London"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"and he was just having a pint"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"and he was talking to some dude"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"who started chatting him up about the weather"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"and just some bull (beep)"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"and him just being really funny and charming."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"And then he was like, ""Oh, I gotta get up and go."""
01:38:30;01:38:31;"And he gets up to leave."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"""Oh (beep), I'm needed somewhere."""
01:38:33;01:38:35;"He says to the bartender,"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"the Keith Richards of flight attendants goes,"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"""Man, that guy looks so much like Liam Gallagher."""
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And the bartender goes, ""It is."""
01:38:42;01:38:46;"And he turns around and he just gets right into a Bentley"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"outside this place and takes off."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:38:49;01:38:53;"- And so he's just hanging out at a really neighborhood"
01:38:53;01:38:56;"place, having himself a pint, talking to strangers."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"And this is-- - Love that."
01:38:57;01:39:00;"- I know, it's very much every story you hear about him."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Just absolutely the character you want him to be."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"- I love that."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"I also have this memory when we were,"
01:39:08;01:39:09;"because we were talking about all the references"
01:39:09;01:39:12;"for the songs and what he thought was cool"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"and I was referencing the Kinks a little bit"
01:39:14;01:39:17;"and I was like, I think maybe I asked him,"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"""Do you ever cross paths with those guys?"""
01:39:18;01:39:19;"He's like, ""Yeah, all the (beep) time."""
01:39:19;01:39:21;"And there's this funny parallel"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"'cause there's these two famous English bands"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"with brothers who famously fight."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"He just said something funny."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"He's like, and you could tell he's a huge fan,"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"but it's something about being at the pub."
01:39:31;01:39:32;"And he's like, ""I always see Ray Davies."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"""He always asks me, 'How's my brother?'"""
01:39:33;01:39:35;"And I say, ""How's your (beep) brother?"""
01:39:35;01:39:37;"And I was just like, you could totally picture it."
01:39:37;01:39:42;"Just like, for whatever reason, it's like, I don't know."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"The American music scene, maybe 'cause it's a big country,"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"it's not down to earth enough,"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"but I could totally picture this."
01:39:47;01:39:51;"A London pub, Ray Davies in there drinking by himself."
01:39:51;01:39:52;"Liam walks in for a thing."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"I have this funny exchange, ""How's your brother?"""
01:39:54;01:39:55;"""How's your (beep) brother?"""
01:39:55;01:39:57;"It actually feels real."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Him pulling up in the Bentley hat."
01:39:59;01:40:02;"And I guess, yeah, who in the US would do that?"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"It just wouldn't be quite the same."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"It's just so English."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"And one issue that maybe is bigger than anything"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"in terms of how people act is just,"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"America doesn't have pubs."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"We don't have quite that combination of,"
01:40:15;01:40:18;"we have dive bars, we have noisy sports bars."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"We don't have that slight, it's like,"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"'cause a pub could have a touch of dive bar,"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"but also a touch of cozy living room."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"It's like a unique-"
01:40:27;01:40:28;"- Family restaurant, right?"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"- Yeah, it's like a family restaurant"
01:40:30;01:40:33;"meets a living room, meets a dive bar."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"America really could use some pubs."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"- They really could, man."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- Introducing the TC Pub."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"- Yeah, baked potatoes."
01:40:40;01:40:44;"- The first TC Pub is opening in Cleveland, summer '22."
01:40:44;01:40:49;"- Yeah, it sort of hits different to say,"
01:40:49;01:40:52;"yeah, I saw Steve Malcomus"
01:40:52;01:40:55;"at this like (beep) dive bar in the valley."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"- You'd be like, ""Damn, is he okay?"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"""What happened to him?"""
01:40:59;01:41:01;"- Yeah. - Oh God."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"Yeah, not quite the same."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"I mean, I'm sure there's an English person listening"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"being like, ""You got it totally wrong."""
01:41:05;01:41:06;"But of course, we're looking at it"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"from a different perspective."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"And it always struck me as being so,"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"I always like pubs when I'm in the UK"
01:41:13;01:41:16;"just because they're quiet and cozy."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- They got carpet. - I don't know."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"- Yeah, and they have a carpet."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"Basically, America just needs more carpet."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Is that what it's all about, actually?"
01:41:25;01:41:26;"- Carpeted bars."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"- Carpeted bars."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"The new album from Guided by Voices."
01:41:32;01:41:35;"Okay, well, anyway, shout out to Liam Gallagher."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"Very happy to be part of your album."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"- Sounds good, bud."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"- Yeah, that was a fun song to work on."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"All right, you ready for the top five?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- Yes, sir."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- Too bad."
01:41:44;01:41:48;"Oh, in lieu of the top five, we're gonna do the top one"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"because something very interesting has happened."
01:41:50;01:41:55;"Kate Bush, very recently, was number one in the iTunes store."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"And some people say the iTunes store"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"doesn't matter that much."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"They wanna know about streaming."
01:42:00;01:42:00;"Well, guess what?"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"She's crushing it on streaming."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"And some people only think it's official"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"if you're talking about Billboard."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Well, guess what?"
01:42:06;01:42:07;"She's in the Billboard top 10."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"So I think this deserves its own segment."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"For anybody who's been living under a rock,"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"the reason Kate Bush is back"
01:42:14;01:42:18;"is because her classic '80s song, ""Runnin' Up That Hill,"""
01:42:18;01:42:21;"was in the new season of ""Stranger Things,"""
01:42:21;01:42:23;"and it's really taken off,"
01:42:23;01:42:26;"and it's kind of literally becoming a hit song again."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"- Amazing."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"- We haven't talked about Kate Bush that much on the show."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Jake, I'm curious,"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"what's your relationship with Kate Bush like?"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"- Oh, I'm a fan."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"I don't know it in a deep sense."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"I know that record."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"- ""Hounds of Love?"""
01:42:39;01:42:40;"- ""Hounds of Love."""
01:42:40;01:42:41;"I was gonna say, is it ""Cloudbusting?"""
01:42:41;01:42:42;"No, ""Hounds of Love."""
01:42:42;01:42:44;"""Cloudbusting"" is the song on that album."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"- Yeah, and I know the one before that, too."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"It's been, I'm a little rusty, I gotta say,"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"but in my life, I have spent a lot of time with her music,"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"but it's been years."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"- Well, her first big hit ever in the UK"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"was ""Wuthering Heights."""
01:42:57;01:42:58;"That was a number one."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"- That's what I'm thinking of."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"- A debut number one single, and that's--"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"- Yes."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"- Like, I'm sure like many people,"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"that got me into Kate Bush."
01:43:05;01:43:09;"Like many Americans, I had never heard that song casually."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"I guess in the UK, it's a classic."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"That was like a number one hit"
01:43:12;01:43:15;"when she was maybe like 16 or something."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"- What?"
01:43:16;01:43:17;"- And her story is cool."
01:43:17;01:43:20;"She was like semi-discovered by David Gilmour"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"from Pink Floyd."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"- Oh, I didn't know any of this, wow."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"- Worth noting that she produced,"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"after a certain point, she produced all her own stuff,"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"including ""Running Up That Hill."""
01:43:29;01:43:31;"So when you think about it that way,"
01:43:31;01:43:35;"Kate Bush is also a very influential and sick producer,"
01:43:35;01:43:38;"in addition to being a great singer and songwriter."
01:43:38;01:43:41;"But I knew very little about Kate Bush"
01:43:41;01:43:44;"until I think I was like 16 or 17,"
01:43:44;01:43:47;"and I was just getting, you know,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"I was just like obsessed with music."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"And I'd always be psyched to get my hands"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"on like an English music magazine,"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"just 'cause like the way they wrote about music"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"was like a little bit different."
01:43:58;01:44:01;"You know, a picture like the late, like '99, 2000,"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"somebody handed me like a copy of ""Q."""
01:44:03;01:44:05;"I was like really fascinated by it."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Anyway, at some point, there was some list of songs,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"and you know, of course there's a ton of crossover"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"with what American critics at the time"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"considered classic music in the UK."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"It was some list, and somebody said,"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"it said something about Kate Bush, ""Wuthering Heights,"""
01:44:17;01:44:20;"and I'd read the book ""Wuthering Heights"" and enjoyed it."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"And I was like, what is this (beep)?"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"Kate Bush sounds familiar."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"There's a song called ""Wuthering Heights,"""
01:44:24;01:44:26;"and they're like, oh, this was the number one single."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"It all sounded so weird and exotic."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"And I think on, maybe on some like early ""Soul Seek"""
01:44:31;01:44:33;"or something, I like downloaded ""Wuthering Heights,"""
01:44:33;01:44:36;"and I was like, this (beep) crazy."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"I still love that song. - It really is."
01:44:37;01:44:38;"Wait, should we listen to that real fast?"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"- Yeah, yeah, we could do a little Kate Bush rundown."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"- I haven't heard that song in so long."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"I'm very excited to hear it."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"(gentle music)"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"So what year is this, by the way?"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"- I think like '78."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Can I get a number crunch, Seinfeld?"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"- '77."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"- '77."
01:44:54;01:44:55;"- Wow, right as punk is blowing up."
01:44:55;01:44:59;"♪ We were falling free ♪"
01:44:59;01:44:59;"♪ You had a tender heart ♪"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"- But I think, yeah, it's so funny, this music."
01:45:02;01:45:05;"It's like, it's a little bit like easy listening,"
01:45:05;01:45:08;"or like kind of like musical theater."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"- Wait, wait, wait, I gotta clarify."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"March '77 is when it was written,"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"came out in '78, January."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"- Ah, okay. - You are correct."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"- It could be really bad."
01:45:18;01:45:19;"- Yes."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"- But it's really good."
01:45:20;01:45:24;"♪ You told me I was going to lose the fight ♪"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"♪ Leave me high and die ♪"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"♪ Walking through, walking through, walking through ♪"
01:45:28;01:45:31;"♪ The high and deep ♪"
01:45:31;01:45:34;"♪ You see, I can't see, I can't hold my ♪"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"- This song is also so weird."
01:45:36;01:45:39;"I could picture like a young punk rocker"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"listening to like The Clash and Suicune the Banshees"
01:45:41;01:45:45;"and Sex Pistols, hearing this and being like,"
01:45:45;01:45:48;"ah man, I mean, the melodies are just so strong."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"The key changes so much."
01:45:50;01:45:57;"♪ Ooh, it gets tough ♪"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"♪ It gets bumpy ♪"

01:46:09;01:46:11;"- Well, I remember like in the '90s,"
01:46:11;01:46:14;"I was listening to Bjork for a while"
01:46:14;01:46:17;"and part of it was that she seemed like she emerged"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"fully formed from like another planet."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"I was just like, what is this music?"
01:46:22;01:46:25;"And then I heard Kate Bush and I was like,"
01:46:25;01:46:28;"oh, it makes a little more sense though."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"- Yeah, there's definitely some crossover."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"I wonder if Bjork listened to Kate Bush,"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"but like, yeah, that kind of, the drama."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"- Sure."
01:46:34;01:46:38;"And the sophisticated, like harmonic language."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"All which is to say, not to take away from Bjork,"
01:46:40;01:46:43;"but just Bjork seemed a little less alien."
01:46:43;01:46:44;"- Right."
01:46:44;01:46:45;"- When I heard Kate Bush."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"- Whereas Kate Bush."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"- Maybe seems a little alien."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"- It's hard to think of what came."
01:46:49;01:46:52;"- Joni Mitchell, McGregor sisters."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"- I guess David Bowie."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"- Really?"
01:46:56;01:46:56;"Yeah, Bowie."
01:46:56;01:47:02;"- In 2021, Bjork told Far Out Magazine,"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"her favorite 11 albums of all time."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"And Kate Bush's The Dreaming is on there."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"- Boom."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"All right, good call, Jake."
01:47:13;01:47:20;"One thing I love so deeply about this song"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"is the guitar solo on the outro."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"- Yes, at the end, yes."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"- It truly is one of my favorite guitar solos of all time."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"It's beautiful."
01:47:31;01:47:34;","
01:47:34;01:47:39;","
01:47:39;01:47:52;"Here it comes."
01:47:55;01:48:01;"Shout out to Ian Barnstone."
01:48:04;01:48:08;"He was on the Alan Parsons Project."
01:48:08;01:48:09;"- Oh."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"So quiet."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"- I mean, he's kind of,"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"he played in the Bay City Rollers."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- Oh."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"- He played in that band Pilot,"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"who had that hit single Magic."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"- Do you believe in magic?"
01:48:25;01:48:26;"- Ooh, it's magic."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"(laughing)"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"- Oh, ooh, it's magic."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"- Yeah."
01:48:31;01:48:32;"This is my favorite part."
01:48:34;01:48:35;"Right as it fades out."
01:48:37;01:48:49;"(laughing)"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- I love it, man."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Like an extended outro like that."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"- Tasty."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"- You know what would have been tight?"
01:48:54;01:48:58;"A Jerry Garcia band, like 1980 cover of this."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"- Oh my God."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"I don't know if Jerry can handle that vocally."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- No, he can handle it vocally,"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"but just over that simple chord change."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"- It'd be so rough."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Heathcliff!"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"(laughing)"
01:49:08;01:49:13;"- Jerry Garcia band, live at Keene College, 1980."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"With Wuthering Heights."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"(laughing)"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"But the solo would be sick."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Bam."
01:49:21;01:49:21;"- Yeah."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"(singing)"
01:49:23;01:49:25;"- But it'd have that really clean,"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"that really clean, sparse Jerry tone."
01:49:27;01:49:31;"None of this fuzz that that guy was doing."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"- Oh yeah."
01:49:32;01:49:32;"- It would just be this, yeah."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"(singing)"
01:49:34;01:49:37;"- Yeah, it would basically be like the Ruben Charese version."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"- Amazing."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"- Just a beautiful song."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I remember hearing that for the first time,"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"just being like, oh, incredible."
01:49:43;01:49:47;"But at the time, I didn't know anybody really who was like,"
01:49:47;01:49:50;"Kate Bush was not like a popular reference."
01:49:50;01:49:50;"- No."
01:49:50;01:49:54;"- And to be fair, that was like a very quiet period."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"So she wasn't really in the cultural consciousness."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"She was, she kind of dipped, which also I love."
01:50:00;01:50:03;"Anybody who dips, I really respect that."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"- Yeah."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"- I guess from '78 to '91,"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"she was releasing a lot of music"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"and then things really slowed down."
01:50:10;01:50:13;"But then I think one of my friends"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"bought Hounds of Love at like a yard sale"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"and we all got super in."
01:50:16;01:50:19;"There's another song, I think from the second or third album"
01:50:19;01:50:22;"that me and all my friends really got into,"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"including Wes from Ra Ra Riot, who's went on to cover it."
01:50:25;01:50:27;"Have you ever heard the song called Suspended in Gaffa?"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"- No, is that not on Hounds of,"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"I only know Hounds of Love, really."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"- Because between the Wuthering Heights"
01:50:33;01:50:36;"and Hounds of Love, I think there's like two or three albums."
01:50:36;01:50:36;"- Well, no, there's two."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"Okay, there's the Kick Inside,"
01:50:37;01:50:40;"which is the first one with Wuthering Heights."
01:50:40;01:50:41;"There's Lionheart."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"There's Never Forever."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"And then there's The Dreaming."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"So Hounds of Love is her fifth record."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"- Deep."
01:50:48;01:50:50;"You're throwing Suspended in Gaffa."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"- Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK,"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number one."
01:50:57;01:50:58;"That's amazing."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"Kate Bush and Madonna, toe to toe."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"- Meanwhile in the US, I think she was only just starting"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"to be known on that album."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"- Oh yeah, me and my friends love this song."

01:52:01;01:52:03;"Truly some weird (beep)"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"One thing I love about is, it's always like,"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"what the (beep) is suspended in Gaffa mean?"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"Then like finally read somewhere that Gaffa"
01:52:12;01:52:16;"is what some people in the UK call Gaffer tape."
01:52:16;01:52:16;"- Uh-huh."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"- It's a song about Gaffer tape in a sense."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Like she's saying, I don't know why I'm crying."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"Am I suspended in Gaffer tape?"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"It's just so weird."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"I love that."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"- Yeah, there's that black Gaffer tape."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"- Yeah."
01:52:30;01:52:33;"- I mean, her stuff, it like verges"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"on the musical theater circus energy,"
01:52:35;01:52:39;"but it never goes into that like dorky aesthetic"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"that that stuff frequently can."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"It's, she really rides the line."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"- Oh yeah."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"- And in the videos, there's some like real wild,"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"over the top dancing."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"- So like, did she, she must have like toured the US"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"in the eighties."
01:52:53;01:52:58;"Like when like Kate Bush like played LA in like 85"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"on the Hounds of Love tour, where was she playing?"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"I'd love to know that."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Seinfeld, did Kate Bush ever tour the US?"
01:53:04;01:53:09;"- So Kate Bush only toured once in 1979."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"- What?"
01:53:12;01:53:15;"- Apparently, let me see if I can."
01:53:15;01:53:16;"- Wow."
01:53:16;01:53:17;"- She's like killing it in the UK,"
01:53:17;01:53:21;"touring the UK and Europe and like releasing so much music."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"It probably didn't make sense to go like."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"- Can you imagine if like Kate Bush played it like,"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"she'd play the Hollywood Bowl now."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"If she came to LA now."
01:53:29;01:53:30;"- She could probably do three nights at the,"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"well now she could probably do four nights"
01:53:32;01:53:33;"at the Hollywood Bowl."
01:53:33;01:53:37;"- She also did a residency at the Hammersmith Apollo"
01:53:37;01:53:40;"in 2014, 22 dates."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"- Is that in New York?"
01:53:41;01:53:42;"- That was in London."
01:53:42;01:53:47;"For her first time live since touring in '79."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"- Wait, what?"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"So she just didn't tour in the eighties."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"- Beatles style."
01:53:51;01:53:56;"- Yeah, she only toured 28 dates in Europe in 1979."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"The only time she's performed in the US"
01:54:00;01:54:01;"was for Saturday Night Live."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"- What?"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"In '79?"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"- Yeah, '78 was her."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"- SNL performance?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"- Eric Idle was the host."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"- Oh, very English episode."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"Yeah, I guess she was posted up,"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"just like making these albums,"
01:54:18;01:54:19;"probably making videos,"
01:54:19;01:54:22;"probably doing some promotional appearances, but wow."

01:54:32;01:54:36;"I remember like, kind of like towards the end of college,"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"it was unclear what caused it."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"It wasn't like this, like a Stranger Things type thing,"
01:54:41;01:54:45;"but just suddenly like every kind of like cool,"
01:54:45;01:54:49;"interesting person I knew was like talking about Kate Bush."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"I kind of even remember when like YouTube was new,"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"being in college and just somebody being like,"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"""Yo, check this out."""
01:54:55;01:54:56;"And they threw on a Kate Bush video."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"And I was like, ""Oh, okay, interesting choice."""
01:54:58;01:55:01;"There was just like this turning point when I guess."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- Yeah."
01:55:02;01:55:04;"- And then, I don't know, like a lot of people,"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"she had a later single called ""This Woman's Work"""
01:55:06;01:55:08;"and Maxwell covered it."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"So I guess like some people knew that."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"But anyway, many people believe that Kate Bush"
01:55:13;01:55:14;"kind of like reached her high point"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"with the album ""The Hounds of Love"""
01:55:16;01:55:18;"and then ""Running Up That Hill."""
01:55:18;01:55:20;"So I kind of get the impression that ""Running Up That Hill"""
01:55:20;01:55:22;"was like a big hit in the UK."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"I bet in the US, it was probably like"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"on some like college radio station,"
01:55:27;01:55:31;"like late night alternative type (beep)"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"'cause she just wasn't a pop star here."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"She didn't have this precedent."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"People weren't like, ""Oh yeah,"
01:55:35;01:55:38;"""remember she'd had those big hits in the late 70s."""
01:55:38;01:55:42;"- It reached number 30 on the US Billboard Hot 100."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"- And I bet that's until now,"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"that's probably like the highest she ever got in the US."
01:55:46;01:55:49;"- This was her first, so the return of this song"
01:55:49;01:55:53;"was her first top 10 in New Zealand, Canada, and the US."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"- Amazing."
01:55:58;01:56:02;"To me, this is such a point of reference for like,"
01:56:02;01:56:06;"this reminds me like when ""Vampire Weekend"" first came out."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"I don't know, there's so many like bands"
01:56:07;01:56:11;"that were doing like this kind of like dark 80s."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"- Like synth, yeah."

01:58:23;01:58:24;"- I'll make like some Smith stuff."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"Like, I don't know."
01:58:25;01:58:29;"- No, but I mean like in our era, like big pop songs."
01:58:29;01:58:33;"- Like stuff we'd hear in the top five, like Morgan Wallen."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"- Where's Morgan Wallen's running up that hill?"
01:58:35;01:58:36;"Yeah, I don't know."

01:58:40;01:58:42;"I'm just saying it's quite a unique moment"
01:58:42;01:58:45;"when this would be number one in the UK."
01:58:45;01:58:47;"- Yeah, I mean, I could hear this like right next"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"to like later period Weekend."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"- Yeah, Weekend probably likes Kate Bush."
01:58:51;01:58:52;"- Well, it's so funny 'cause yeah,"
01:58:52;01:58:56;"we've heard like a lot of like '80s influenced Harry Styles"
01:58:56;01:58:59;"and Weekend on the top five the last year or two."
01:58:59;01:59:02;"And then it's funny that this like was on Stranger Things"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"and like kind of punches through the noise"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"and it's sort of like, let's just get back to the original."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"- Right, cut out the middle, man."
01:59:10;01:59:14;"I mean, and the dope thing about Kate Bush is like,"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"I guess you could say that this is true"
01:59:16;01:59:19;"of many of the greatest of all time figures."
01:59:19;01:59:22;"She makes something close enough to pop music"
01:59:22;01:59:25;"that she had many hits in her day,"
01:59:25;01:59:29;"but she's thinking about and reading stuff"
01:59:29;01:59:34;"as esoteric and weird as any like weirdo noise artist."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:35;01:59:36;"That's what you want."
01:59:36;01:59:39;"Like those truly are like the goats,"
01:59:39;01:59:42;"the Kate Bushes, the David Bowies,"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"like even like the Kanye's or something."
01:59:44;01:59:47;"People who like are, they have this knack"
01:59:47;01:59:51;"for kind of songwriting and pop form"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"and yet they arguably are as weird,"
01:59:53;01:59:56;"if not weirder than anybody you would meet"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"in any kind of like underground scene."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"You know, they're that idiosyncratic."
02:00:00;02:00:02;"Like it's the best combination."
02:00:02;02:00:04;"All the best people have some version of that."
02:00:04;02:00:05;"Well, we could talk about Kate Bush forever."
02:00:05;02:00:07;"I just want to end on one more Kate Bush song"
02:00:07;02:00:08;"'cause I didn't know this song"
02:00:08;02:00:10;"until actually pretty recently."
02:00:10;02:00:13;"And this is some cool, like later Kate Bush."
02:00:13;02:00:15;"Well, not later because this is the last album"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"before her hiatus."
02:00:17;02:00:21;"And there is cool stuff on like the 2000s era stuff"
02:00:21;02:00:24;"but this is the last album of her kind of like"
02:00:24;02:00:27;"original run from '78 to '93."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"This album is called ""The Red Shoes""."
02:00:28;02:00:31;"Can you throw on the song ""You're the One""?"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"'Cause it's just like a different side of Kate Bush."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"This is her doing kind of like a Prince thing."
