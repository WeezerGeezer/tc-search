00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis back once again. On this week's episode, we'll be joined by surprise guest"
00:07;00:15;"Despot in the studio. We'll talk about the burning debate about steroid use in sports."
00:15;00:23;"Plus we'll dig into the mailbag, listen to the greatest hits of 1977 and today. This is"
00:23;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:31;00:37;"When you pass me by, all of those great romances"
00:37;00:44;"Do what I felt, lovingly, all my rightful chances"
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:09;01:13;"Leave it on me babe"
01:13;01:16;"Time Crisis back in effect. What's up Jake?"
01:16;01:17;"Hey."
01:17;01:22;"You got some real pep in your step. You doing something different with your hair?"
01:22;01:23;"I got a haircut yesterday."
01:23;01:24;"Okay, there's that."
01:24;01:26;"She put a little product in my hair."
01:26;01:27;"Oh, your product guy now?"
01:27;01:28;"Which I never do."
01:28;01:30;"Gotta get on the product wave."
01:30;01:36;"And I remember I bought product a few months ago, last time I was at the salon."
01:36;01:38;"And then I completely forgot about it."
01:38;01:40;"But now are you gonna maybe start using it more?"
01:40;01:41;"Unlikely."
01:41;01:43;"I need a haircut bad right now."
01:43;01:44;"It's looking good, it's shaggy."
01:44;01:52;"It's a little shaggy. I always go get my hair cut and then the hairdresser will teach me how to use the product."
01:52;01:56;"And then I kind of forget and I do a half-assed job of using the product."
01:56;01:58;"But I put a little something in every day."
01:58;02:01;"I always found it funny that they just call it product."
02:01;02:04;"I still find that kind of funny."
02:04;02:07;"It's like, you know, because obviously there's a lot of different types of products."
02:07;02:11;"There's gels and pastes and sprays."
02:11;02:17;"But the idea that the umbrella term for all of these things is just product."
02:17;02:19;"That's like just saying like stuff."
02:19;02:21;"Yeah, it's like saying like food."
02:21;02:23;"The haircut is a product as well."
02:23;02:26;"Goods and services could be considered products."
02:26;02:30;"I'm into this use of the word product in general."
02:30;02:34;"Maybe some email you have with like your record label or like your publicist."
02:34;02:36;"And they're just like, well, we want to put forth a good product."
02:36;02:38;"Yeah, well, that's classic."
02:38;02:39;"I love that."
02:39;02:40;"People always say that."
02:40;02:42;"I thought you were gonna just be using more like day-to-day life."
02:42;02:45;"Just like, babe, I'm stopping by 7-Eleven on my way home."
02:45;02:46;"You need any products?"
02:46;02:48;"I've never said that."
02:48;02:49;"Thanks, Jake."
02:49;02:55;"I could use some of those pre-made hard-boiled eggs in the little plastic thing."
02:55;02:58;"And also some shaving cream and Advil."
02:58;03:00;"Those are three products that I could use."
03:00;03:01;"Oh, and a hot dog."
03:01;03:03;"Four products."
03:03;03:05;"And some hair product."
03:05;03:06;"And some hair product."
03:26;03:33;"Anyway, when I came in, Jake, you were delighting in a promotional photo of Kiefer Sutherland."
03:33;03:34;"I was."
03:34;03:38;"And for people who don't know, Kiefer Sutherland is a beloved American actor."
03:38;03:41;"Best known for playing Jack Bauer, I would say."
03:41;03:43;"Yeah, to a certain generation."
03:43;03:46;"I know him from being in one of my favorite '80s films, Lost Boys."
03:46;03:47;"Oh, sure."
03:47;03:48;"He plays a young vampire."
03:48;03:50;"But you know, Kiefer Sutherland, he's a major dude."
03:50;03:52;"A lot of films and programs over the years."
03:52;03:58;"Oh, and also recently, relevant to the show, Designated Survivor."
03:58;04:03;"Designated Survivor, which if people don't remember, is a dog-sh*t ABC show that Jake loves."
04:03;04:05;"I stopped watching it finally."
04:05;04:06;"I fell off the wagon."
04:06;04:08;"I don't know if that's the right term, but."
04:08;04:09;"[Laughter]"
04:09;04:11;"So Kiefer Sutherland is an American actor."
04:11;04:12;"Yeah."
04:12;04:14;"He's been doing his thing for 30-plus years."
04:14;04:15;"Yeah."
04:15;04:19;"But what people might not know is that he's also a musician."
04:19;04:22;"And I celebrate people going between this and that."
04:22;04:23;"Totally."
04:23;04:25;"I think all actors should make albums."
04:25;04:27;"I love Russell Crowe's music."
04:27;04:29;"Yeah, there's some good sh*t in there."
04:29;04:33;"And these days, you see some actors making big music."
04:33;04:34;"Yeah."
04:34;04:37;"But Kiefer Sutherland, I actually didn't know that he did music."
04:37;04:41;"But you saw this picture, a promotional picture for, I guess he has an album coming out soon."
04:41;04:42;"Yeah."
04:42;04:47;"And the picture, the reason you were delighting in it, Kiefer Sutherland, a.k.a. Jack Bauer,"
04:47;04:50;"just posing in front of a truck."
04:50;04:52;"A Peterbilt semi-grille."
04:52;04:54;"A semi, yeah, not a pickup truck."
04:54;04:55;"No, 18-wheeler."
04:55;04:56;"An 18-wheeler."
04:56;05:02;"And first of all, these promotional pictures that people see of artists, you know,"
05:02;05:03;"sometimes we take it for granted."
05:03;05:05;"Somebody had to put some thought into that."
05:05;05:09;"You know, when you click on Apple Music and you see a picture of Drake or something,"
05:09;05:13;"Drake did a photo shoot, and then he said, ""I want this to be one of my promotional pictures."""
05:13;05:18;"We've had to do all these, like, nightmare photo shoots, thankfully I haven't had to do it in a few years,"
05:18;05:22;"where you have to pick a photographer, pick locations, pick what you're going to wear,"
05:22;05:29;"because this is going to be your dumbass press photo that's going to be used on websites, stores,"
05:29;05:31;"things like that, so you're going to have to make a decision."
05:31;05:33;"Like, are we going to horse around?"
05:33;05:34;"Keep it light?"
05:34;05:35;"Are we going to keep it light?"
05:35;05:36;"Maybe."
05:36;05:39;"We used to have a press photo that was used a lot where they just took us to some, like, place,"
05:39;05:43;"like a photography place in London where people just, like, take pictures."
05:43;05:46;"So just have different rooms and props."
05:46;05:51;"And then we did this picture where there was, like, an old-timey, like, horn,"
05:51;05:56;"I guess almost like a megaphone, like a cheerleading, like, megaphone-type horn thing, and it was giant."
05:56;05:57;"Yeah."
05:57;05:59;"I don't even know if I'm describing it properly, but it's like,"
05:59;06:03;"it was always, you could, like, take and you could be yelling into it and the other guy's, like, holding it up."
06:03;06:08;"And it's, like, this goofy-ass picture we did, and then I was, like, I've literally seen it a billion times since then,"
06:08;06:10;"just, like, rolling up to do a show somewhere, and, like, that's the one."
06:10;06:11;"Yeah."
06:11;06:14;"But anyway, you have to, one way or another, these things affect your image."
06:14;06:16;"They affect the product."
06:16;06:18;"The way the product is being marketed to the marketplace--"
06:18;06:20;"The product rollout."
06:20;06:21;"This is part of it."
06:21;06:25;"So anyway, Kiefer Sutherland chose to pose in front of an 18-wheeler."
06:25;06:29;"Honestly, if I saw that picture, I wouldn't think twice about it, but what caught you about that, Jake?"
06:29;06:35;"Well, picturing Kiefer being a passionate owner of an 18-wheeler,"
06:35;06:38;"I kind of went on a flight of fancy, I'll be honest."
06:38;06:43;"We were joking with Nick before the show about it, was the idea of, like, a Hollywood actor."
06:43;06:44;"Yeah."
06:44;06:46;"Son of a famous Hollywood actor, also."
06:46;06:47;"Right."
06:47;06:50;"And then a guy that's sort of like, ""You know what? I'm going to hit the open road."
06:50;06:53;"I want to go see real America."""
06:53;06:58;"That's kind of a classic thing, is that you got actors who consider themselves to be kind of like alpha male types,"
06:58;07:01;"because everything about it, they play alpha males."
07:01;07:03;"They play, like, action heroes and s--t."
07:03;07:04;"Yeah."
07:04;07:09;"But then there's this funny tension there, because you might be playing, like, badass dudes on screen,"
07:09;07:13;"but at the end of the day, you are a sensitive, artistic craftsman."
07:13;07:14;"You are a thespian."
07:15;07:16;"Is it ""thes-be-an"" or ""thespian""?"
07:16;07:18;"Well, it's a ""p,"" so I always say ""thespian."""
07:18;07:21;"I said ""thes-be-an,"" like a lesbian with a ""th."""
07:21;07:24;"I've heard people rhyme those words before, but I always pronounce it ""thespian."""
07:24;07:25;"Okay. ""Thespian."""
07:25;07:29;"But so there's this funny tension, and I think that really gets under a lot of actors' skin."
07:29;07:30;"Right."
07:30;07:34;"Especially these, like, supposedly badass dudes, and that's why you hear about them getting into, like,"
07:34;07:36;"some random fight at a bar in Malibu."
07:36;07:37;"Right."
07:37;07:41;"Or there'll be, like, some biker just be like, ""You think you're tough? F--k you, man."""
07:41;07:42;"Tough guy on TV, huh?"
07:42;07:43;"Yeah."
07:43;07:45;"""What you gonna do now, Jack Bauer?"""
07:45;07:53;"So the fantasy was that Kiefer owned a gleaming new, shiny '18 Wheeler"
07:53;07:56;"and would drive it out to, like, Iowa."
07:56;07:57;"Right."
07:57;08:01;"Or Texas somewhere to a truck stop just for, like, the experience of, like,"
08:01;08:03;"""I wanna get on the open road."""
08:03;08:06;"But he's driving, like, a huge '18 Wheeler, and then he's pulling into a way station."
08:06;08:08;"Yeah, 'cause people do that with motorcycles all the time."
08:08;08:09;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Take a road trip."
08:09;08:12;"'Cause, like, weekend warrior, like, bougie dudes will be, like,"
08:12;08:15;"jump on the Harley with their boys and, like,"
08:15;08:18;"""Yeah, go knock back a few cold ones at, like, a roadhouse."""
08:18;08:22;"And be like, ""Man, I wish I could just take that monkey suit off,"
08:22;08:26;"tell my boss at Goldman Sachs to shove it, and just hit the open road."""
08:26;08:29;"Hollywood's BS. I'm making $14 million a year."
08:29;08:31;"I bet that s--t happens all the time."
08:31;08:33;"I bet there's, like, bars outside of L.A."
08:33;08:34;"That's funny."
08:34;08:38;"That's just, like, at least once a week, like, an actor rolls out on a Harley."
08:38;08:39;"Yeah."
08:39;08:41;"Just, like, somewhere out in the desert."
08:41;08:42;"Is that Taylor Kitsch?"
08:42;08:43;"Yep."
08:43;08:45;"Oh, yeah."
08:45;08:47;"We had a Zac Efron in here the week before."
08:47;08:49;"You guys know each other?"
08:49;08:53;"No, I don't know him. Hollywood's bulls--t, man."
08:53;08:56;"I like coming out here talking to real people like you."
08:56;08:59;"All right. You got a head shot?"
08:59;09:02;"Got a head shot to put up behind the bar?"
09:02;09:07;"But doing it in 18 Wheeler is 10 times funnier."
09:07;09:09;"The fantasy was Kiefer in 18 Wheeler."
09:09;09:12;"Just pulling into, like, a weigh station, and the guy being like, ""What do you got in there?"""
09:12;09:13;"""Nothing."""
09:13;09:16;"Oh, really? You just ride for the love of trucking?"
09:16;09:19;"That's right, sir. God bless you."
09:19;09:20;"Never done it professionally."
09:20;09:21;"Yeah."
09:21;09:22;"This is a hobby."
09:22;09:23;"[laughs]"
09:24;09:27;"You've heard songs about truck drivers many times, their story told."
09:27;09:31;"How they pulled out of Pittsburgh for six days on the road."
09:31;09:36;"'Bout that Feather River Canyon, and a-climbin' that old grapevine."
09:36;09:40;"That old roadhouse down in Texas, and the girls they left behind."
09:40;09:45;"You've heard their tales of daring, and I think that's just fine."
09:45;09:50;"But if you could spare a minute, well, I'd like to tell you mine."
09:50;09:55;"There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks."
09:55;09:59;"No double clutching, gear jamming, coffee drinking nuts."
09:59;10:04;"They drive their way to glory, and they have all the luck."
10:04;10:08;"There'd be no truck drivers if it wasn't for us trucks."
10:08;10:11;"Should we pull up the Kiefer record from a few years ago?"
10:11;10:13;"Yeah, yeah, 'cause we don't have the new one."
10:13;10:15;"I'm kind of curious what it sounds like. I'm picturing kind of smoky bar rock."
10:15;10:16;"This will help with the fantasy."
10:16;10:20;"By the way, when I said I loved the music of Russell Crowe, it was fully sarcastic."
10:20;10:21;"I don't think that really landed."
10:21;10:23;"Have you even heard it?"
10:23;10:25;"Yes, I've seen YouTube clips."
10:25;10:29;"Kiefer Sutherland's last album was in 2016, and it's called ""Down in a Hole."""
10:29;10:30;"And this is the--"
10:30;10:34;"Down in a hole. You know the Alice in Chains song?"
10:34;10:35;"No."
10:35;10:37;"Okay."
10:37;10:39;"I know ""Man in the Box."""
10:39;10:42;"[beatboxing]"
10:42;10:45;"I'm the man in the box."
10:45;10:47;"Being in holes in boxes, that was--"
10:47;10:49;"It's a recurring theme for Alice in Chains."
10:49;10:53;"But this is the notes on Kiefer Sutherland's last album on Apple Music."
10:53;10:58;"""Charred southern rockers and stormy country laments to satisfy Americana diehards."""
10:58;11:00;"So there you go."
11:00;11:03;"He's going for, like, the real [bleep]"
11:03;11:06;"The younger actors, they go more for, like, EDM."
11:06;11:09;"But Kiefer's generation is more just like, ""Yeah, here's some, like, rude [bleep]."""
11:09;11:10;"So let's check it out."
11:10;11:13;"Track one on the last album is called ""Can't Stay Away."""
11:13;11:21;"[guitar playing]"
11:21;11:25;"Yeah, picturing Kiefer getting his commercial driver's license."
11:25;11:31;"Getting that CDL. Ooh."
11:31;11:33;"This is like a tasteful '90s palette."
11:33;11:35;"I'm on board so far."
11:35;11:37;"This could be Pearl Jam."
11:37;11:39;"Yeah."

12:14;12:16;"I mean, so far, you really can't say a bad word about it."
12:16;12:20;"You could say it's unoriginal, but beyond that, it's, ""I'm feeling hip."""
12:20;12:21;"Yeah, I mean--"
12:21;12:22;"You could say that."
12:22;12:26;"You played that, and you were just like, ""Yeah, it's one of the guys from Pearl Jam's side project."""

15:09;15:11;"and he's talking to some real country head who's just like,"
15:11;15:14;"""You know, Kiefer, I could hear some of the influences, man."
15:14;15:17;"""Man, you sound like you've been listening to a little '38 special,"""
15:17;15:20;"and he's like, ""I'm glad you caught that, man, blah, blah."""
15:20;15:22;"And then some other guy comes up, like,"
15:22;15:26;"""Will you sign this Jack Bauer limited-edition promotional baseball cap?"""
15:26;15:30;"And Kiefer's just like, ""Jesus Christ, you'll have to excuse me."""
15:30;15:32;"Or maybe he's into it. I don't know."
15:32;15:35;"Season 7, when those warlords are tunneling into the White House."
15:35;15:37;"Yeah."
15:37;15:38;"Just amazing."
15:38;15:42;"A lot of designated survivor."
15:42;15:44;"Just in between songs."
15:44;15:47;"Whoo! Designated survivor!"
15:47;15:49;"[laughs]"
15:49;15:51;"That is the call-out."
15:51;15:54;"Yeah, just whatever, like, you're into it."
15:54;15:56;"Hey, you know what?"
15:56;15:58;"As we say in the business, it's a good problem to have."
15:58;15:59;"Yeah."
15:59;16:03;"♪ I'm going down in the Feather River Canyon ♪"
16:03;16:07;"♪ Gotta go down, got her summer's clothes ♪"
16:07;16:12;"♪ Another 80 miles, and I'm sure lonesome ♪"
16:12;16:16;"♪ 'Cause I'll be late getting home ♪"

16:34;16:36;"Time Crisis."
16:36;16:40;"So, a couple episodes ago, we were talking about Avengers Infinity War."
16:40;16:45;"And actually, I've seen that it's become a meme about people riffing on the idea that"
16:45;16:50;"Avengers Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover event in history."
16:50;16:53;"And people do these memes where they're like, ""Well, what about this?"""
16:53;16:54;"And show some funny thing."
16:54;16:55;"Right."
16:55;16:59;"And we were talking about what I still think is a great idea."
16:59;17:00;"Oh, that's right. That's right."
17:00;17:08;"We should write a 1,000 to 1,500-page giant novel that's a crossover event"
17:08;17:11;"using classic '90s New York TV shows."
17:11;17:15;"And we're talking about Sex and the City, Friends, Seinfeld, just to start."
17:15;17:18;"And if we wanted to start throwing in Mad About You and things, you know, whatever."
17:18;17:24;"But we could have a face-off between Kramer and Chandler, things of that nature."
17:24;17:28;"George dating Cynthia Nixon's character."
17:28;17:29;"Yeah, exactly."
17:29;17:30;"Miranda."
17:30;17:31;"Yeah."
17:31;17:35;"I recently watched the first three episodes, season one, Sex and the City."
17:35;17:36;"Oh, really? Because--"
17:36;17:37;"Hannah fired him up."
17:37;17:39;"You've never seen it before?"
17:39;17:40;"No, I had years ago, but--"
17:40;17:42;"Just getting back in, revisiting--"
17:42;17:45;"She was just like, ""You know what? I'm re-watching this entire series."""
17:45;17:48;"Maybe I should watch it. I've only caught a few episodes here and there."
17:48;17:49;"Held up."
17:49;17:50;"Still a good program?"
17:50;17:51;"Yeah."
17:51;17:52;"I want to check it out."
17:52;17:56;"Separate show, maybe, where we do a recap on every Sex and the City episode."
17:56;18:02;"We've been talking about whether or not we should start a podcast to supplement our internet radio show."
18:02;18:08;"And I've noticed that a lot of the podcasts that really have legs are about some existing IP."
18:08;18:12;"I remember we had Demi on. He came on the show in the early days."
18:12;18:15;"And he used to have this huge podcast called Gilmore Guys."
18:15;18:16;"Is that over?"
18:16;18:17;"Yeah, they wrapped it up."
18:17;18:18;"Because they did the whole series."
18:18;18:19;"And I think they just want to go out on top."
18:19;18:23;"But they were doing live podcasts in front of sold-out theaters."
18:23;18:24;"Yeah, no, exactly."
18:24;18:27;"We're talking about Season 5, Episode 6."
18:27;18:29;"And also, he's just a talented, funny guy."
18:29;18:30;"So, obviously, that helps."
18:30;18:31;"Of course."
18:31;18:32;"Clearly, they tapped into some."
18:32;18:37;"There's a lot of people who wanted to enjoy this meta-conversation about Gilmore Girls."
18:37;18:40;"And I'm sure there is one for Sex and the City."
18:40;18:41;"Probably multiple."
18:41;18:42;"Yeah."
18:42;18:43;"That's a crowded field."
18:43;18:48;"There probably are multiple ones that are even branded as like, ""Hey, listen. We're just two regular guys."
18:48;18:50;"Our girlfriends love this show. We never actually watched it."
18:50;18:55;"It's going to be hilarious. Just two regular guys watching a show that on the surface seems like it's made for women."""
18:55;18:56;"Very touching, though."
18:56;19:00;"At first, I thought the shoes and the shopping, I wasn't going to relate to it."
19:00;19:03;"But you know, at the end of the day, it's a show about people."
19:03;19:05;"It's about love. It's about heartbreak."
19:05;19:06;"Just human beings."
19:06;19:10;"That's me and your Sex and the City podcast."
19:10;19:15;"Anyway, we were talking about doing an ambitious crossover event."
19:15;19:16;"Yeah."
19:16;19:24;"Similar to Avengers Infinity War, except it would be a novel about New York '90s shows."
19:24;19:30;"And I was ready to invest out of pocket a significant amount of money in this."
19:30;19:36;"Because, you know, I'm a musician first and foremost, but I'm also a businessman."
19:36;19:41;"And when I come across a great idea, I know you've got to spend money to make money."
19:41;19:45;"So I was ready to take a significant portion of my life savings and put it into this."
19:45;19:48;"Because I think the profit could be outrageous."
19:48;19:50;"Better than the stock market."
19:50;19:52;"I mean, let's say this book sold 10 million copies."
19:52;19:53;"I like where your head's at."
19:53;19:57;"Every dollar you put in, especially if we didn't team up with a book company."
19:57;19:59;"Oh, self-publish."
19:59;20:00;"Self-publish."
20:00;20:02;"We could be selling PDFs online."
20:02;20:04;"We could do promo on the show here."
20:04;20:10;"We could get Seinfeld--you could be in charge of actually doing the shipping of the physical things."
20:10;20:12;"Bottom of the totem pole."
20:12;20:15;"I thought Seinfeld was going to do the social media aspects."
20:15;20:18;"But also the physical warehousing."
20:18;20:24;"I mean, I assume I'd be a collaborator as well on the actual creative part of this project."
20:24;20:29;"Sure, but I'm saying we already pay you to do social media."
20:29;20:33;"So we wouldn't have to incur any extra costs by just adding a few things."
20:33;20:34;"Fair."
20:34;20:35;"You could run the warehouse."
20:35;20:36;"So anyway."
20:36;20:39;"Are you a certified forklift operator?"
20:39;20:42;"I could be."
20:42;20:48;"I think it's fair that you pay for your forklift certification just because after we sell the 10 million copies,"
20:48;20:50;"we just taught Amanda Fish."
20:50;20:53;"You'll be taking that forklift certification with you to future jobs."
20:53;20:57;"So the idea that we have to pay for it doesn't seem fair."
20:57;20:59;"I assume that's a tax write-off anyway."
20:59;21:01;"Oh yeah, of course."
21:01;21:02;"That's between you and the IRS."
22:30;22:36;"The issue with it is that as much as people love ambitious crossover events,"
22:36;22:41;"clearly, as we can see in the culture right now, you need to own the IP."
22:41;22:46;"And in the case of the Avengers movie, Disney owns Marvel now."
22:46;22:47;"That's all under one umbrella."
22:47;22:50;"So Disney owns Black Panther."
22:50;22:52;"They own Iron Man."
22:52;22:53;"Spider-Man."
22:53;22:54;"They own Spider-Man."
22:54;22:55;"Wonder Woman."
22:55;22:57;"Superman."
22:57;22:58;"No."
22:58;22:59;"Okay, I was just testing you, Jake."
22:59;23:01;"Nice, dude. Nice."
23:01;23:04;"Wonder Woman and Superman are from the DCU."
23:04;23:05;"Okay."
23:05;23:08;"The DC Comics universe."
23:08;23:09;"They should just merge, right?"
23:09;23:11;"What's stopping them at this point?"
23:11;23:13;"Did you mention congressional hearings?"
23:13;23:16;"We don't want monopolies in the comic book industry."
23:16;23:19;"Bernie Sanders just grilling Bob Iger."
23:19;23:24;"You're telling me you want to own Batman and Iron Man under the same roof?"
23:24;23:27;"I enjoyed Avengers Affinity War as much as the next guy."
23:27;23:37;"And, of course, who hasn't dreamed of seeing Hawkeye and Aquaman in the same cinematic universe?"
23:37;23:44;"But in the spirit of competition and a thriving marketplace that this country was built on,"
23:44;23:48;"we cannot have the DCU and the MCU merge."
23:48;23:52;"And then just, like, some, like, paid-off Republican senator."
23:52;23:54;"[laughs]"
23:54;23:59;"Well, what my colleague from Vermont fails to understand is that this is just business."
23:59;24:04;"You think in China they're worrying about Aquaman and Hawkeye coming together in one universe?"
24:04;24:05;"Far from it."
24:05;24:09;"We just want to offer consumers the best options available."
24:09;24:10;"Yeah."
24:10;24:12;"He's on the payroll."
24:12;24:13;"The antitrust."
24:13;24:15;"Yo, that'd be crazy."
24:15;24:21;"I wonder if they've thought about it and they've actually decided that keeping separate is actually more advantageous."
24:21;24:23;"Or it's a long game thing."
24:23;24:27;"Disney, like, quietly buys DC through a shell corporation."
24:27;24:30;"And then little by little they just kind of tease it."
24:30;24:34;"But anyway, for our novel, novels and films are different."
24:34;24:35;"Let's break this down."
24:35;24:37;"Let's break it down."
24:37;24:40;"They're two different art forms and the laws apply differently."
24:40;24:45;"For whatever reason, in a novel you're allowed to, especially under the guise of satire,"
24:45;24:49;"you're allowed to reference a character or something."
24:49;24:50;"Right."
24:50;24:52;"But in films, not so."
24:52;24:53;"In fact, I was thinking about this."
24:53;24:58;"After we had this discussion, my sister invited me to see the film Ready Player One."
24:58;25:00;"Are you familiar with this?"
25:00;25:01;"I'm familiar."
25:01;25:02;"I've not seen it."
25:02;25:04;"It's the new Steven Spielberg movie."
25:04;25:09;"Ready Player One, if you don't know what it's about, it is an ambitious crossover event of its own"
25:09;25:17;"because it all takes place in a VR world that was designed by a guy, a creator who grew up in the '80s"
25:17;25:21;"and was obsessed with comic books and action movies."
25:21;25:22;"Back to the future and stuff."
25:22;25:23;"Yeah, like nerdy stuff."
25:23;25:32;"So you see all these familiar faces and the people in the VR world will use avatars of famous characters."
25:32;25:35;"Somebody will be riding the bike from Akira."
25:35;25:40;"At one point I saw a Battletoad, which is a very deep cut '90s reference."
25:40;25:42;"The Iron Giant is in it."
25:42;25:46;"It's just a lot of stuff, some superheroes."
25:46;25:49;"Then I was reading about it that Ready Player One is based on a novel."
25:49;25:52;"In the novel, the guy just went crazy."
25:52;25:56;"He's referencing video games and characters from just everything he could think of."
25:56;25:57;"So he had more leeway with the novel."
25:57;25:59;"He had more leeway because he wrote a novel."
25:59;26:05;"Then when they made the film, and you know Steven Spielberg, he's a major dude, in Hollywood at least."
26:05;26:10;"When he rides his Harley a couple hours out to Bakersfield, I don't know if they roll out the red carpet for him,"
26:10;26:12;"but in Hollywood he's a major dude."
26:12;26:14;"So he knew that he was going to make this movie."
26:14;26:21;"So he was savvy about which IP he could get under the umbrella of the studio he was doing and who he could reach out to."
26:21;26:24;"They had to change a few things for the film."
26:24;26:30;"So anyway, when we were talking about our ambitious crossover event novel,"
26:30;26:33;"we asked if there were any lawyers who listened to Time Crisis,"
26:33;26:36;"and if they could hit us up about it, if they knew anything about IP."
26:36;26:39;"We got one from a guy named Riley Andrews."
26:39;26:43;"He's trying to school us a little bit about can we call this a parody,"
26:43;26:53;"can we reference Samantha and Rachel and Elaine Bennis with impunity in our kind of satirical novel."
26:53;26:55;"And it's going to be satirical, but it's going to have a little heart too."
26:55;26:57;"So this is what Riley Andrews had to say."
26:57;27:00;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
27:00;27:02;"Seinfeld Ezra and Jake."
27:02;27:05;"To begin, while I am a practicing attorney, I am not an IP attorney."
27:05;27:09;"So I must clearly state that I cannot give legal advice on the subject."
27:09;27:10;"Very lawyerly."
27:10;27:11;"Yup."
27:11;27:15;"With that being said, I did take an excellent copyright course in school a few years back,"
27:15;27:18;"and would be willing to give you some excerpts from the study guide I made."
27:18;27:21;"In the case of Campbell vs. Acuff-Rose Music,"
27:21;27:28;"it was determined that 2 Live Crew's song ""Pretty Woman"" was indeed a parody of the Roy Orbison song ""Oh Pretty Woman."""
27:28;27:34;"It is uncontested that the song would be an infringement, but for a finding of fair use through parody."
27:34;27:38;"2 Live Crew departs markedly from the original lyrics and produced many different sounds from the original song."
27:38;27:40;"Therefore, the original song was transformed."
27:40;27:42;"So everybody knows Roy Orbison, ""Pretty Woman."""
27:42;27:43;"Of course."
27:43;27:44;"Pretty woman."
27:44;27:51;"And then 2 Live Crew was an early 90s rap group that was known for having very raw and dirty lyrics."
27:51;27:55;"So just so people know what we're talking about, the original Roy Orbison song from the 60s sounds like this."
28:09;28:13;"Pretty woman, walking down the street."
28:13;28:17;"Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet."
28:17;28:19;"Pretty woman, I'm gonna find you."
28:19;28:23;"This is much faster than I remember it being."
28:23;28:26;"In my head it's sort of like a ballad because it's so pretty."
28:26;28:29;"The melodies, you know."
28:29;28:30;"This is a fun song."
28:30;28:31;"It's like real fast."
28:35;28:39;"Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?"
28:39;28:43;"Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see."
28:43;28:49;"Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be."
28:49;28:55;"Are you lonely just like me?"
28:55;28:57;"Wow."
29:02;29:05;"Pretty woman, stop awhile."
29:05;29:09;"Pretty woman, talk awhile."
29:09;29:17;"Pretty woman, give your smile to me."
29:17;29:19;"So you get the idea."
29:19;29:22;"That's the original Roy Orbison song, ""Pretty Woman."""
29:22;29:26;"And then a while later, 2 Live Crew made their song called ""Pretty Woman."""
29:26;29:28;"It sounds like this."
29:46;29:49;"Pretty woman, walking down the street."
29:49;29:53;"Pretty woman, girl, girl, you look so sweet."
29:53;29:57;"Pretty woman, you bring me down to that knee."
29:57;30:04;"Pretty woman, you make the water beg, please."
30:04;30:10;"Pretty woman, big hairy woman."
30:10;30:11;"Hairy?"
30:11;30:13;"Big hairy woman."
30:13;30:15;"You know I bet it's tough."
30:15;30:17;"Big hairy woman."
30:17;30:21;"All that hair, it ain't legit."
30:21;30:25;"'Cause you look like cousin A."
30:25;30:27;"Rough stuff."
30:27;30:31;"Well, they're talking about some real [bleep] Jake."
30:31;30:34;"We live in a society where people judge each other on their appearances."
30:34;30:37;"And Roy Orbison, he was calling her a pretty woman."
30:37;30:39;"They're calling her a hairy woman."
30:39;30:42;"Is it called hairy woman?"
30:42;30:44;"That's what they say."
30:44;30:52;"But I guess in this court case, the judge said that 2 Live Crew was making a parody."
30:52;30:53;"Yeah."
30:53;30:54;"I mean obviously."
30:54;30:56;"But I guess clearly they use a lot of elements."
30:56;30:59;"So the publisher of Pretty Woman was suing 2 Live Crew."
30:59;31:00;"Yeah."
31:00;31:06;"So Riley goes on to say, ""The character and use of the new work alters the original work with new meaning expression."
31:06;31:09;"A parody only works if you imitate the original."
31:09;31:12;"Thus, many similarities must be allowed."""
31:12;31:13;"And this is interesting."
31:13;31:14;"I didn't know this."
31:14;31:19;"""While parody uses the thing it's copying to make fun of the thing itself, which is okay,"
31:19;31:25;"satire is when one copies something in order to make fun of something else, which is not allowed."""
31:25;31:26;"Okay."
31:26;31:27;"Wow, that's a distinction."
31:27;31:32;"That's also funny that the law has to weigh in where somebody would be like--"
31:32;31:38;"the publisher of Pretty Woman would be like, ""Judge, they weren't making fun of our song."
31:38;31:40;"They were making fun of hairy women."
31:40;31:43;"They were using our song to make fun of hairy women."""
31:43;31:44;"And then the lawyer was like, ""No, no."
31:44;31:48;"They were making fun of the original conceit of the song Pretty Woman by changing those lyrics."""
31:48;31:51;"And the judge is like, ""I got to go to live crew on this one."
31:51;31:55;"They were roasting the s--t out of that Roy Orbison song."""
31:55;31:57;"It's like such a weird thing for--"
31:57;31:58;"Oh, my--yeah."
31:58;32:02;"Anyway, he talks about another case, the case of Rogers versus Coons."
32:02;32:04;"I believe that's Jeff Coons."
32:04;32:09;"The plaintiff is a professional photographer who took a photo of two people holding a line of puppies."
32:09;32:13;"The defendant is an artist who admits to purchasing note cards with the photo on it."
32:13;32:18;"The defendant tells the artist who worked for him to create a sculpture that looks like the plaintiff's original puppy photo."
32:18;32:20;"This is determined to be a derivative work."
32:20;32:26;"The defendant attempts to claim this is a parody of Society at Large, but this explanation sounds more like satire."
32:26;32:30;"Therefore, the defendant loses here while two live crew is successful in their parody argument."
32:30;32:33;"So Coons' lawyer wasn't up on that distinction."
32:33;32:37;"Jeff Coons' lawyer was like, ""Yeah, just say it's a parody of Society at Large."
32:37;32:38;"No problem."""
32:38;32:40;"And they're like, ""Oh, well, that doesn't work."""
32:40;32:41;"That's a satire."
32:41;32:50;"Yeah, also, I guess it's probably a little harder for two live crew to say we were making a parody of a famous Roy Orbison song."
32:50;32:53;"It's easier to accept than Jeff Coons being like, ""Oh, yeah."
32:53;33:02;"I just really wanted to take an obscure postcard that I found down a peg by making a statue of it."""
33:02;33:04;"I also like the way Riley signed his email."
33:04;33:08;"Riley, Wilmington, North Carolina, one fridge owner."
33:08;33:11;"Well, Riley, law can be a very lucrative profession."
33:11;33:15;"I bet you have two fridges before you know it."
33:15;33:18;"I wanna tell you this, for a while, I like your fake blue eyes and your chill style."
33:18;33:20;"So let's go for a walk through the park."
33:20;33:23;"You can suss my head in the dark and just do what I ask."
33:23;33:26;"It's been dope, so let me ride you backside like dogs do each other."
33:26;33:28;"I know that you're with it, so don't start throttling."
33:28;33:30;"I don't wanna be your man, I wanna move something."
33:46;33:52;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
33:52;33:58;"Don't you think it's weird, man, that the government should be like telling us"
33:58;34:00;"what is and is not parody?"
34:00;34:03;"Well, yes, when you put it that way."
34:03;34:08;"But it's really more a function of someone bringing suit against someone else"
34:08;34:10;"and someone has to arbitrate, right?"
34:10;34:15;"I mean, there should be a structure for someone to call someone out if they're getting ripped off."
34:15;34:17;"But it's weird with art."
34:17;34:22;"If I'm like manufacturing some product and then someone rips my idea off"
34:22;34:26;"and is manufacturing the exact same product that I have a patent on,"
34:26;34:28;"then, yeah, you should be able to sue them, right?"
34:28;34:32;"But if you wrote a song, the art is very tricky."
34:32;34:35;"You know, it's also funny, like we were kind of joking before about"
34:35;34:40;"if there's a congressional hearing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe"
34:40;34:42;"merging with the DC Universe."
34:42;34:48;"Because the government technically does have a point of view about ownership of art"
34:48;34:50;"and that's in the form of copyright."
34:50;34:53;"Because copyrights don't last forever."
34:53;34:54;"Right, that's true."
34:54;34:59;"And it's been an issue because back in the day, I don't know how long a copyright lasted, 50, 60 years?"
34:59;35:01;"Yes, I think a little longer, but yeah."
35:01;35:06;"But there's so many things and they always are extending."
35:06;35:08;"Well, Mickey Mouse, right?"
35:08;35:11;"Yeah, so people call that the Mickey Mouse thing because basically,"
35:11;35:16;"Disney is such a powerful company that every time Mickey Mouse is about to go into the public domain"
35:16;35:21;"or whatever you call it, they have an insane amount of pressure that they can put on Congress"
35:21;35:23;"to extend copyrights."
35:23;35:27;"Well, first of all, some people would say, ""Well, why shouldn't copyrights last forever?"""
35:27;35:34;"I think one of the arguments is that ultimately people recognize that there's a social benefit"
35:34;35:40;"if things like ideas and art at some point become property of humanity."
35:40;35:41;"Right."
35:41;35:47;"For instance, imagine if the Bach or the Mozart family still owned that [expletive]"
35:47;35:52;"and every time there was like an orchestra wanting to perform a piece of work from Mozart"
35:52;35:56;"or somebody wanted to take a chord progression from Mozart or have some inspiration or riff on Mozart,"
35:56;36:00;"they had to go get the permission of a family that's been owning it for hundreds of years."
36:00;36:03;"I understand the emotional idea of that."
36:03;36:09;"After you die, somebody wants to be able to protect your legacy for the next 30, 40 years or something."
36:09;36:10;"Yeah."
36:10;36:14;"Maybe even considers that their inheritance is your body of work."
36:14;36:20;"But then as you start to get further from that, then picture like your grandchildren"
36:20;36:26;"selling it to like a multinational corporation or something and them owning it for 100 years."
36:26;36:30;"And we're really starting to approach 100 years with Disney continuing to push this [expletive]"
36:30;36:39;"and then you would have situations like the 10th great-grandson of somebody from the 19th century"
36:39;36:41;"owning that and having control over it."
36:41;36:47;"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great-great-grandson still owning Sherlock Holmes."
36:47;36:51;"Chad Shakespeare, USC fraternity brother."
36:51;36:53;"Oh, my family's rich as [expletive]"
36:53;36:56;"You ever read Romeo and Juliet in high school?"
36:56;36:57;"Yeah, well."
36:57;37:00;"My great-great-great-great-grandfather wrote that."
37:00;37:06;"When your school bought those 50 [expletive] paperback copies of Romeo and Juliet,"
37:06;37:08;"then we went straight to my family."
37:08;37:10;"And look, I like this idea that it's like temporary."
37:10;37:16;"I would like to leave to my family my vast holdings of Vampire Weekend Publishing for a little bit."
37:16;37:17;"Fast."
37:17;37:19;"Three albums, man."
38:11;38:31;"What about the, um, the, like, Coca-Cola recipe?"
38:31;38:33;"Is that going to become public domain?"
38:33;38:35;"Or is it just for works of art?"
38:35;38:37;"I think patents expire, too."
38:37;38:42;"This also gets to some crazy [expletive] too, is, like, think about the ways that pharmaceutical companies"
38:42;38:46;"can exert their crazy ownership over this [expletive]"
38:46;38:49;"and, you know, they make the case, listen."
38:49;38:50;"R&D?"
38:50;38:54;"R&D. We spent billions of dollars developing this cure,"
38:54;38:58;"and now what, we're just going to give it out to, like, poor people who are dying from XYZ?"
38:58;38:59;"Okay."
38:59;39:01;"That's a type of argument."
39:01;39:05;"But just imagine if, like, yeah, something older, like,"
39:05;39:10;"Marie Curie was just, like, patented the concept of radiation, like, it's, like, some broad sense."
39:10;39:12;"Or somebody patented, like, penicillin."
39:12;39:16;"If you really go down the line, you can really start to, like, withhold that stuff and just, like, milk people for,"
39:16;39:18;"I mean, that's different, but."
39:18;39:21;"Yeah, because something like Tylenol, this is so weird and deep."
39:21;39:25;"Something like Tylenol, you can make, like, a, I don't see, yeah, I don't know what we're talking,"
39:25;39:28;"at this point I'm off the deep end with what we're talking about because."
39:28;39:31;"Well, we're just talking about, like, actually, you know what,"
39:31;39:34;"Kanye recently tweeted something similar about this."
39:34;39:40;"He got back on Twitter and he's been kind of typing almost like a book of philosophy."
39:40;39:41;"Wow."
39:41;39:43;"Just saying a lot of things that he thinks."
39:43;39:47;"Kanye is considered one of the greatest creators of his generation."
39:47;39:48;"Yep."
39:48;39:49;"But he's also a very collaborative person."
39:49;39:50;"He works with a lot of people."
39:50;39:52;"He samples a lot of music."
39:52;39:54;"Yeah, for sure."
39:54;39:58;"Kanye is not the artistic, cultural products of Kanye West"
39:58;40:01;"are the blood, sweat, and tears of hundreds of people."
40:01;40:03;"But, you know, Kanye's at the helm."
40:03;40:06;"I'm not taking anything away from him, but he's a collaborative person."
40:06;40:10;"So he says this, ""Too much emphasis is put on originality."
40:10;40:13;"Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will."
40:13;40:15;"All great artists take and update."""
40:15;40:18;"Some people would also make the case that just human culture and art"
40:18;40:22;"is about ideas being flipped and transformed."
40:22;40:23;"Totally."
40:23;40:26;"You know, what most people call, like, their cultural background"
40:26;40:32;"are these ancient ideas that really have been developed over thousands of years and changed."
40:32;40:35;"So Kanye says he thinks too much emphasis is put on originality."
40:35;40:36;"Cars have four wheels."
40:36;40:37;"Hoodies have hoods."
40:37;40:40;"It's amusing to me when someone says this is an original hoodie."
40:40;40:42;"Bro, it's a hoodie."
40:42;40:43;"Yeah."
40:43;40:46;"He says, ""I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality"
40:46;40:49;"and letting my ego push me to say things like, 'This person stole from me.'"
40:49;40:53;"And the funny thing is, it'll be a reference I took from somewhere."""
40:53;40:55;"Let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas."
40:55;40:58;"It is important that ideas see the light of day,"
40:58;40:59;"even if you don't get the credit for them."
40:59;41:03;"Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation."
41:03;41:05;"This is still Kanye?"
41:05;41:06;"Yeah."
41:06;41:07;"Wow."
41:07;41:08;"It has a lot to do with what we're talking about."
41:08;41:09;"So I can picture it."
41:09;41:14;"We're up there, and we're saying, ""Yes, we did not create the character of Chandler,"
41:14;41:17;"nor did we create the character of Kramer."
41:17;41:23;"But whoever owns that s--t, NBC, you're so concerned with the ownership of ideas."
41:23;41:32;"It's important that the Kramer versus Chandler epic flying battle through New York City took place."
41:32;41:37;"Yes, you're not getting credit for it in the sense that we're not paying you for it,"
41:37;41:45;"but shouldn't we just all be glad as human beings that the 80-page description"
41:45;41:51;"of the Chandler versus Kramer final battle, in which one of them dies, I won't say which,"
41:51;41:54;"shouldn't we just be glad that that exists, that it saw the light of the day?"
41:54;41:55;"You still own Seinfeld."
41:55;41:57;"You still own Friends."
41:57;42:00;"Kanye West would agree with us, I'd like to think."
42:00;42:04;"I'm living in the 21st century, doing something mean to it,"
42:04;42:07;"doing better than anybody I've ever seen do it."
42:07;42:10;"Screaming from the haters, got a nice ring to it."
42:10;42:13;"I guess every super hit don't need his fame music."
42:13;42:16;"No one man should have all that power."
42:16;42:19;"The clock's ticking, I just count the hours."
42:19;42:22;"Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power."
42:22;42:25;"21st century shit's on the line."
42:25;42:29;"The system's broken, the schools closed, the prisons open."
42:29;42:32;"We ain't got nothing to lose, everybody we rolling."
42:32;42:35;"Everybody we rolling."
42:35;42:38;"With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rollins."
42:38;42:41;"In this white man world, we the ones chosen."
42:41;42:44;"So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning."
42:44;42:47;"I'll see you in the morning."
42:47;42:50;"This is way too much, I need a moment."
42:50;42:53;"No one man should have all that power."
42:53;42:56;"The clock's ticking, I just count the hours."
42:56;42:59;"Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power."
42:59;43:02;"Tear in, that's the world's hours."
43:02;43:06;"And let me hear you, and let me hear you."
43:06;43:11;"And let me hear you, and let me hear you."
43:11;43:15;"21st century shit's on the line."
43:15;43:18;"The personnel and the whole cast."
43:18;43:21;"Telling me they said they could kiss my whole ass."
43:21;43:24;"More specifically, they could kiss my ass."
43:24;43:28;"I'm an ass, you got drugs."
43:28;43:31;"You sure mind if I start with Napoleon?"
43:31;43:34;"My first is Mongolia, my ice brought the goldies."
43:34;43:37;"And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic."
43:37;43:40;"He know he's so fucking gifted."
43:40;43:43;"I just needed time alone with my own thoughts."
43:43;43:47;"Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault."
43:47;43:51;"My talent, creativity, purity, and honesty is honestly."
43:51;43:53;"Being crowded by these grown thoughts."
43:53;43:55;"Reality is catching up with me."
43:55;43:58;"Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody."
43:58;44:01;"But these responsibilities, if they entrusted me."
44:01;44:05;"As I look down at my diamond, it crushed the peace."
44:05;44:08;"Thinking no one man should have all that power."
44:08;44:11;"The clock's ticking, I just count the hours."
44:11;44:14;"Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder."
44:14;44:18;"Tear them, get the world's hours."
44:18;44:24;"In my name, in my name, in my name, in my name."
44:24;44:27;"In my name, in my name, in my name."
44:27;44:30;"20% change, it's all good."
44:30;44:33;"Powers, powers, Austin, powers."
44:33;44:36;"Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation."
44:36;44:39;"They say I was the Obama nation of Obama's nation."
44:39;44:42;"Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation."
44:42;44:46;"At the end of the day, God, I'm killing this shit."
44:46;44:49;"I know damn well y'all feeling this shit."
44:49;44:52;"I don't need your shit, I'm on my own."
44:52;44:54;"I ain't got a power chip."
44:54;44:55;"Who you going home with?"
44:55;44:57;"How you doing?"
44:57;44:58;"I'm surviving."
44:58;45:00;"I was drinking earlier."
45:00;45:01;"Now I'm driving."
45:01;45:03;"What a bad time."
45:03;45:04;"Where y'all hiding?"
45:04;45:07;"I got the power, make your life so exciting."
45:07;45:12;"Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide."

46:35;46:37;"- Good idea. - Yeah."
46:37;46:40;"- I'm kind of making this up as it comes along."
46:40;46:47;"We write, produce and manufacture that novel"
46:47;46:50;"on an artificial island in international waters."
46:50;46:52;"Ooh."
46:52;46:53;"You have to order it,"
46:53;46:55;"but you order it from international waters."
46:55;46:57;"They can't really touch us."
46:57;47:00;"- But I could totally picture NBC, that's a big company."
47:00;47:01;"Jerry Seinfeld, he's a major player,"
47:01;47:03;"at least in the New York area."
47:03;47:04;"They could pull some strings"
47:04;47:08;"to make sure that our books don't make it through customs."
47:08;47:12;"- They would send Blackwater after us, dude."
47:12;47:13;"- Yeah, that's right."
47:13;47:15;"We're thinking too analog about this, maybe."
47:15;47:16;"- They could invade our little island."
47:16;47:17;"You know, it's funny,"
47:17;47:19;"I was also thinking about international islands."
47:19;47:20;"I love that ""Time Crisis"" is becoming"
47:20;47:24;"just like a totally inept inventions show,"
47:24;47:25;"just like pitching ideas."
47:25;47:27;"It's like a really bad shark tank."
47:27;47:29;"(laughing)"
47:29;47:30;"I had an idea that I actually think is good."
47:30;47:31;"And actually, Seinfeld,"
47:31;47:35;"it also involves an island in international waters."
47:35;47:37;"And truthfully, in this world,"
47:37;47:39;"I'm not gonna hold my breath to believe"
47:39;47:41;"that even if we pitch in all our money"
47:41;47:44;"and buy an island and make our own nation,"
47:44;47:46;"that that's gonna stop us from, you know,"
47:46;47:49;"Uncle Sam putting his (beep) combat boot on our throat,"
47:49;47:50;"'cause that's how they roll."
47:50;47:51;"You can't really get away"
47:51;47:54;"from the global imperialist machine."
47:54;47:56;"But anyway, this is my other idea"
47:56;47:59;"that involves an island in international waters."
47:59;48:01;"I watched the movie ""Icarus""."
48:01;48:02;"- What's that?"
48:02;48:04;"- ""Icarus"" is a Netflix documentary"
48:04;48:07;"that won best documentary at the last Academy Awards."
48:07;48:11;"And it's about a dude who's a big biking enthusiast."
48:11;48:14;"He's like a almost pro kind of amateur dude."
48:14;48:15;"- Like bicycling?"
48:15;48:16;"- Yeah, bicycling."
48:16;48:18;"And he's like very interested"
48:18;48:20;"in the whole Lance Armstrong thing."
48:20;48:23;"And basically, the initial conceit of the movie"
48:23;48:25;"is that he's gonna try to take those drugs,"
48:25;48:28;"performance enhancing drugs, and see what happens."
48:28;48:30;"He's in this kind of like amateur, serious amateur race."
48:30;48:32;"Can he skirt by?"
48:32;48:33;"And then he meets the Russian dude"
48:33;48:35;"who's part of the doping program and blah, blah, blah."
48:35;48:37;"So this is like a big film in that"
48:37;48:40;"it kind of told the story of how the Russians got,"
48:40;48:42;"you know, kicked out of the Olympics."
48:42;48:43;"And I'm watching the whole thing."
48:43;48:45;"And I know people really like that movie,"
48:45;48:47;"but we were watching it at home and I was just like,"
48:47;48:49;"who cares?"
48:49;48:50;"You know, it's like sometimes I feel that way."
48:50;48:51;"- What about doping?"
48:51;48:52;"- Yeah, some part of me,"
48:52;48:55;"'cause like also the movie's like very dramatic."
48:55;48:58;"It's just like, the Olympic Council has decided"
48:58;49:02;"to ban Russia from the games."
49:02;49:02;"- Yeah."
49:02;49:04;"- And then this guy's like,"
49:04;49:07;"this goes all the way to Vladimir Putin."
49:07;49:11;"Putin himself is in charge of the doping program."
49:11;49:15;"You're talking about it like it's spy (beep)."
49:15;49:15;"- Right."
49:15;49:16;"- And there's some part of me that's like,"
49:16;49:19;"maybe just because I'm not much of an athlete."
49:19;49:20;"- You're not a sports fan."
49:20;49:22;"- I'm not much of a sports fan,"
49:22;49:24;"so maybe I don't have that ingrained sense of like,"
49:24;49:27;"holy (beep) this incredibly important thing"
49:27;49:30;"was undermined by evil Russians."
49:30;49:31;"- The purity of the sport."
49:31;49:33;"- Yeah, so I was kind of like, but what do they do?"
49:33;49:35;"Injected themselves with some (beep)"
49:35;49:36;"to get better at sports?"
49:36;49:37;"Like, all right."
49:37;49:38;"- I agree completely."
49:38;49:41;"- So anyway, and then I even think back in the night,"
49:41;49:42;"remember people made this big deal"
49:42;49:44;"about Mark McGuire taking creatine?"
49:44;49:46;"- Yeah, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, all those guys."
49:46;49:47;"- Give us a (beep)"
49:47;49:48;"why don't we ban protein powder too?"
49:48;49:50;"- I agree completely."
49:50;49:52;"Those guys bulldozed through the records."
49:52;49:54;"Here we are talking baseball again."
49:54;49:55;"(laughing)"
49:55;49:57;"- This is an insane idea."
49:57;49:57;"- They're not in the Hall of Fame."
49:57;49:59;"- I just want to shout out to anybody"
49:59;50:00;"who's still listening to this episode,"
50:00;50:01;"'cause it's a real psycho episode."
50:01;50:03;"- This was a weird episode."
50:03;50:04;"This is maybe the weirdest TC yet."
50:04;50:06;"- This is a very weird TC."
50:06;50:08;"Five inception layers deep right now."
50:08;50:11;"- Those guys bulldozed through the home run records,"
50:11;50:13;"and then it's revealed that they were doping,"
50:13;50:17;"taking steroids, and now we're in this like weird gray area"
50:17;50:19;"of like, well, they're not in the Hall of Fame."
50:19;50:20;"Are those records legitimate?"
50:20;50:22;"It's like, yeah, they're legitimate, it happened."
50:22;50:23;"- Right."
50:23;50:27;"- You know, players in the 50s were smoking cigarettes"
50:27;50:28;"and eating hot dogs all day."
50:28;50:30;"Yeah, they didn't perform as well."
50:30;50:32;"Of course, it's sort of like."
50:32;50:34;"- It has come to light that during the recording"
50:34;50:36;"of Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumors,"""
50:36;50:37;"(laughing)"
50:37;50:40;"the band was using substances such as cocaine,"
50:40;50:42;"- Oh."
50:42;50:43;"- Marijuana."
50:43;50:44;"- And creatine powder."
50:44;50:45;"- Okay, and creatine powder."
50:45;50:46;"- Stevie was juicing."
50:46;50:50;"- In light of this, the RIAA has decided to strip them"
50:50;50:52;"of their double diamond status."

51:29;51:31;"But anyway, I'm thinking about this,"
51:31;51:33;"and I'm just seeing these people talking (beep)"
51:33;51:37;"about these poor Russians, Vladimir Putin."
51:37;51:39;"And I just feel bad for them."
51:39;51:42;"Although they did get to wear those cool Olympic athlete"
51:42;51:44;"from Russia uniforms that were actually cooler"
51:44;51:46;"than wearing the Russian uniform in the last Olympics,"
51:46;51:48;"they still let them come."
51:48;51:49;"They just couldn't wear their flag."
51:49;51:52;"It's all crazy when you think about it."
51:52;51:54;"- The Olympics are whack."
51:54;51:56;"- Because people from that country"
51:56;51:59;"injected themselves with steroids,"
51:59;52:01;"the next batch of people from that country"
52:01;52:03;"can't have the flag on their uniform."
52:03;52:04;"- Speaking of weird congressional things too,"
52:04;52:07;"like remember when Mark McGuire was like in Congress,"
52:07;52:10;"like in tears, like wearing like a suit"
52:10;52:11;"that was too small with this huge goatee,"
52:11;52:12;"just like weeping."
52:12;52:16;"- Well, and also now is creatine considered chill?"
52:16;52:17;"There's like so much more hardcore (beep)."
52:17;52:18;"But anyway, this is my idea."
52:18;52:20;"So I'm watching this and I'm feeling bad"
52:20;52:22;"for all these guys 'cause I'm like, you know what?"
52:22;52:25;"You know that I believe that the war on drugs is crazy"
52:25;52:27;"and that we gotta be able to strike a better balance"
52:27;52:30;"between personal liberty and protecting lives."
52:30;52:31;"And so I'm watching this and I just feel bad"
52:31;52:34;"for all these athletes who are maybe just"
52:34;52:37;"consider themselves a bit of an athlete scientist."
52:37;52:39;"And they just wanna see how good they can get with this."
52:39;52:41;"And I'm like, the Olympics are square, man."
52:41;52:45;"We should buy an island and we should start the juice games"
52:45;52:47;"where you can come and you can try,"
52:47;52:50;"we'll set up track and field, biking, whatever."
52:50;52:53;"We'll do all the sports and we'll say, listen,"
52:53;52:54;"this is for people who are interested"
52:54;52:59;"in the intersection of science and athletics."
52:59;53:02;"You take whatever the (beep) you want."
53:02;53:05;"You wanna do a rail and then hit the half pipe?"
53:05;53:06;"You could do that."
53:06;53:08;"- This is sounding like a Diet Coke commercial."
53:08;53:09;"- Yeah."
53:09;53:10;"(laughing)"
53:10;53:12;"You wanna pound a Diet Coke,"
53:12;53:14;"inject yourself with human growth hormone,"
53:14;53:16;"then run a marathon?"
53:16;53:17;"Why not?"
53:17;53:19;"- Diet Coke, because I can."
53:19;53:20;"- So we're gonna partner with Diet Coke"
53:20;53:24;"and bring it to a lawless island in the middle of the ocean."
53:24;53:26;"It'd be also a little bit like Bloodsport,"
53:26;53:28;"that movie where they just invite people"
53:28;53:31;"for a secretive combat to the death thing."
53:31;53:33;"I just like, you know what?"
53:33;53:35;"If there's people who wanna just try,"
53:35;53:37;"they shouldn't be shamed for it."
53:37;53:38;"I understand the argument"
53:38;53:40;"that they're not the best role models."
53:40;53:41;"- For sure."
53:41;53:43;"- I can imagine if you have a kid in Little League"
53:43;53:45;"and you're concerned about their health,"
53:45;53:47;"you probably don't want them at 10 or 11 years old"
53:47;53:49;"fantasizing about using steroids."
53:49;53:50;"I get that."
53:50;53:51;"- Of course."
53:51;53:52;"- I don't want any angry letters from parents."
53:52;53:54;"I understand that."
53:54;53:56;"But I just feel like on some just like crazy (beep)"
53:56;53:59;"like let these crazy people from all around the world"
53:59;54:03;"roll up, do their drugs, and compete."
54:03;54:05;"Maybe we'll be like shattering records."
54:05;54:06;"That'd be interesting, right?"
54:06;54:07;"- Absolutely."
54:07;54:09;"- And then we can have two columns."
54:09;54:11;"There can be like the juice columns."
54:11;54:15;"This guy ran a one second mile."
54:15;54:16;"(laughing)"
54:16;54:18;"- Wait, what's a really fast mile?"
54:18;54:19;"Is it three minutes?"
54:19;54:20;"- 3.47."
54:20;54:24;"I feel like humans have sort of peaked out around there."
54:24;54:25;"3.46, something like that."
54:25;54:27;"- Wouldn't it be interesting to see"
54:27;54:28;"how much faster we can get?"
54:28;54:30;"- Yeah, that would be crazy."
54:30;54:31;"- And I also think--"
54:31;54:32;"- Take HGH and like do a rail coke"
54:32;54:36;"and a pound of Diet Coke and run it in like 3.20."

55:54;55:58;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
55:58;55:59;"- And again, I'm not recommending"
55:59;56:01;"that people take steroids."
56:01;56:03;"I have no interest in it myself at this current juncture."
56:03;56:05;"- No, it should be for people who are already"
56:05;56:07;"at a very elite level and need the edge."
56:07;56:10;"It's not for a high school player"
56:10;56:13;"that thinks he can maybe make the college team."
56:13;56:14;"No, no, no."
56:14;56:15;"- You know, I was texting with my dad about,"
56:15;56:17;"I was pitching him my idea."
56:17;56:19;"- About the steroids island?"
56:19;56:22;"- Yeah. (both laughing)"
56:22;56:24;"It was like, I forget what we were talking about,"
56:24;56:25;"but it made me think of it."
56:25;56:26;"And I was like, ""Hey, what do you think of this?"""
56:26;56:27;"And then he's--"
56:27;56:29;"- Very long text to your dad."
56:29;56:30;"- He's been--"
56:30;56:32;"- ""Okay, dad, picture an island in international waters."""
56:32;56:34;"(both laughing)"
56:34;56:38;"- And he's always been interested in bodybuilding."
56:38;56:39;"- Really?"
56:39;56:41;"- Yeah, well, he's in good shape."
56:41;56:43;"He works out, and then even back in the day--"
56:43;56:43;"- That's tight."
56:43;56:44;"- We had ""Pumping Iron,"""
56:44;56:46;"the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie on VHS."
56:46;56:48;"So he's always had a passing interest in it,"
56:48;56:53;"but he said, ""It's basically the Wild West in that world."""
56:53;56:54;"And he said, ""It's kind of (beep) up"
56:54;56:58;"""because people burn bright and fade out."""
56:58;57:00;"But if you look at some of these pictures"
57:00;57:02;"of these crazy juice heads,"
57:02;57:03;"I'm operating under the assumption"
57:03;57:07;"that they're making these choices of their own volition,"
57:07;57:09;"and they know the pros and cons."
57:09;57:11;"I understand that that's an important part of the argument."
57:11;57:12;"- Yeah, 'cause we are getting into dicey territory,"
57:12;57:13;"but finish your thought."
57:13;57:15;"- Yeah, I know we're getting into dicey territory,"
57:15;57:17;"but again, you ever got like 7-Eleven"
57:17;57:19;"and you just see the cover of a bodybuilding magazine,"
57:19;57:20;"you just look at the person, you're just like--"
57:20;57:22;"- You're just like, ""What the hell?"""
57:22;57:23;"- Is it real?"
57:23;57:24;"- Right."
57:24;57:24;"- Is that a real human being?"
57:24;57:27;"It's like a place where you literally don't have a muscle,"
57:27;57:29;"and that person has a muscle"
57:29;57:30;"the size of a Monster Energy drink."
57:30;57:31;"- Right."
57:31;57:32;"- In the neck area, for instance."
57:32;57:33;"- Right."
57:33;57:34;"- Muscles on top of muscles."
57:34;57:36;"- It's interesting because the crazy,"
57:36;57:37;"and I'm not talking about just like,"
57:37;57:38;"you know, people in great shape,"
57:38;57:39;"you know what I'm talking about?"
57:39;57:40;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
57:40;57:42;"- And the language they use on the cover,"
57:42;57:43;"just like, ""Here's a real monster."
57:43;57:46;"""He's scary."""
57:46;57:47;"And you look at them, it's funny,"
57:47;57:52;"they're so big that they almost stop looking strong."
57:52;57:53;"They start to look like a character"
57:53;57:55;"from Adventureland or something."
57:55;57:56;"- Yeah."
57:56;57:57;"- Like a weird cartoon."
57:57;57:58;"You know, like they're so--"
57:58;57:59;"- Or like a weird pug or something."
57:59;58:01;"- Well, 'cause they're so jacked"
58:01;58:03;"that it's beyond--"
58:03;58:04;"- Functional."
58:04;58:05;"- It's beyond functional."
58:05;58:07;"And so you even wonder, like,"
58:07;58:09;"""Can I take that guy?"""
58:09;58:10;"Like, he's so jacked,"
58:10;58:11;"it must be hard to move his arms around."
58:11;58:13;"But anyway, the one thing--"
58:13;58:15;"- ""Can I take that guy?"""
58:15;58:17;"- Or like, ""I'd almost rather fight that guy"
58:17;58:19;"""than like an NFL player."""
58:19;58:20;"- Right."
58:20;58:23;"Think I feel you on that?"
58:23;58:26;"- I'm talking about the really scary dudes."
58:26;58:27;"And these are the guys who--"
58:27;58:28;"- You think about fighting?"
58:28;58:30;"- Every day."
58:30;58:32;"- Not in an aggressive way, in a defensive way."
58:32;58:33;"- Well, this is funny we're getting into this"
58:33;58:35;"because then the flip side is the NFL."
58:35;58:38;"People are all like freaked out about"
58:38;58:40;"people getting concussions and brain injuries"
58:40;58:41;"having long-term--"
58:41;58:42;"- Well, you know what?"
58:42;58:44;"Because the NFL's dishonest about it."
58:44;58:45;"- Right."
58:45;58:47;"- On Juice Island, we're very honest about it."
58:47;58:49;"- So it's gonna get to that point though"
58:49;58:51;"where it's like, ""Okay, if you play professional football"
58:51;58:53;"""or college football, strap in."
58:53;58:55;"""It's gonna be like really dangerous."
58:55;58:57;"""Like you're risking your long-term health here."""
58:57;58:58;"- Yeah, and you see--"
58:58;58:59;"- That's like, I guess it gets to a point where it's like--"
58:59;59:01;"- And you see players walking away."
59:01;59:02;"People are great at it."
59:02;59:02;"- Yep."
59:02;59:05;"- A lot of sports talk on TC."
59:05;59:06;"- Let's get Mike Francesco on the line."
59:06;59:07;"- But so, yeah."
59:07;59:08;"(laughs)"
59:08;59:11;"But so my point is that you see these guys,"
59:11;59:13;"these just absolute monster men."
59:13;59:14;"- Yeah."
59:14;59:17;"- So jacked, beyond the point of functionality."
59:17;59:21;"And on one level, some people recoil"
59:21;59:22;"'cause they've never seen anything like it."
59:22;59:25;"But there's also a part of me that, I don't know."
59:25;59:27;"Like we do random ass (beep)"
59:27;59:28;"making music, making paintings."
59:28;59:30;"You know, people gotta do what they wanna do."
59:30;59:31;"And I see these guys and I'm like,"
59:31;59:34;"they chose to do something which has pushed the limits"
59:34;59:36;"of what the human body can look like"
59:36;59:38;"and how big muscles can grow."
59:38;59:40;"And they're kinda like astronauts in a way."
59:40;59:42;"They're adventurers, you know?"
59:42;59:44;"They're dedicating their life--"
59:44;59:45;"- Yeah."
59:45;59:47;"- In maybe a weird way to like seeing what happens."
59:47;59:50;"And there is something fascinating about it."
59:50;59:51;"And I respect those guys."
59:51;59:53;"- Taking much bigger risks than we are."
59:53;59:55;"- Yeah, I know."
59:55;59:58;"And at the end of the day, like, it takes a village."
59:58;59:58;"- It takes all kinds, man."
59:58;59:59;"- It takes all kinds, man."
59:59;01:00:03;"So there's some part of me that's like, as much as yes,"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"I understand that you don't want your 12 year old child"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"getting excited about juicing,"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"but there's just some part of me that's like,"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"I don't know, I admire the dreamers, the risk takers."

01:00:42;01:00:46;"instead of being like Einstein and John Lennon,"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"it was just like the most jacked dude ever."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"See, what's messed up is we don't even know"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"that guy's name."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"- No."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"- You gotta respect people who push to a new place"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"that nobody's gone before,"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"especially if they're doing it on their own,"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"'cause that's a lonely journey."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Just like going up to the moon, you know, is lonely,"
01:01:03;01:01:08;"being that guy, that person who pushes their body"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"to the most jackedest, shreddedest that has ever been."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"So here's to the dreamers,"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"the people who heard no and kept going."
01:01:17;01:01:21;"You're just like Mark McGrath, Vladimir Putin."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Also, I love that,"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"that's just like such a classic contradiction"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"of like advertising is so many of the things"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"that we used to describe like believing in yourself"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"also described psychotic, sociopathic behavior."
01:01:34;01:01:37;"Here's to the dreamers, right?"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"The people who busted down a door,"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"people who kept going in the face"
01:01:42;01:01:45;"of all the information of the contrary."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- Truly delusional."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"- Yeah, truly delusional."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"But they pushed and pushed"
01:01:51;01:01:55;"and they became the one in 10 million who actually did it."

01:03:33;01:03:36;"Seinfeld, can you get a number crunch on that?"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Have you been looking at islands this time?"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"- Yeah, I've been shopping for islands."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"Let's see."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- Wait, but I got a question."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"This is gonna be an unpopular idea, right?"
01:03:44;01:03:46;"I'm probably gonna get some pushback."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"- Steroid Island?"
01:03:47;01:03:48;"- Yeah."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"I honestly can't tell."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"Is Steroid Island gonna be,"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"'cause what, do people accuse you of glamorizing steroids?"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Is that the issue?"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"- Like if you actually did, or what we're talking about?"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"- Let's say on the next time crisis we're like,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"""Hey guys, good news."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"We talked to Elon Musk and we--"""
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- He's in."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- He's in."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"We bought a small island."
01:04:06;01:04:09;"It's now its own territory,"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"and we're starting Steroid Island."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"People would probably be mad, right?"
01:04:11;01:04:14;"- Yeah, but it might be just a thing of taste."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"If someone did that, I don't think I would really tune in."
01:04:17;01:04:20;"It's not really my cup of tea."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"- Really?"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"- No."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"- Oh, you're kind of my target demo."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"- I'm not really an MMA guy."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"- Right."
01:04:27;01:04:27;"- I mean, those guys aren't doing roids."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"Oh, maybe they are."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"I don't even know."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"But that's just no holds barred,"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"just go for it kind of stuff."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Wow."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"According to cnnmoney.com,"
01:04:35;01:04:38;"you can get an island for under $100,000."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"- Okay, but this has to be a sizable island."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"- We need infrastructure."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"- We're talking 16 acres here."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"- Where, dude?"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"- 16 acres."
01:04:45;01:04:48;"- Apparently this guy Boris Renginghaus"
01:04:48;01:04:53;"bought a 16 acre island in Nova Scotia, Canada, for 60K."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"So that's probably really cold, like 10 months of the year."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"- In Prague, you're still bound by the laws of Canada."
01:04:59;01:05:04;"We might have to buy it and secede from Canada."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- There you go."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"- I mean, $60,000, we could raise that."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"- Time Crisis Kickstarter?"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"- Time Crisis Kickstarter."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"- Stay in Rhode Island."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"- Are you tired of elite athletes being told"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"what they can and cannot put in their bodies?"
01:05:17;01:05:25;"You know what, also, I'm so deeply uninterested in sports,"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"I don't know why I'm fired up about this one."
01:05:26;01:05:29;"Maybe we gotta talk to some athletes and just be like,"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"""Would this be of interest to you?"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"""'Cause I don't wanna spend all this money."""
01:05:32;01:05:34;"And then nobody shows up."
01:05:34;01:05:34;"But you know, there's like that--"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"- If you build it."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"- I'm just saying there's so many things"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"that people are allowed to do."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"Eat terrible food."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"Make shady investments."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"Or like, you know, the Isle of Man,"
01:05:43;01:05:46;"they have this really fast motorcycle race."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"- Oh wow."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"- And somebody dies basically every year."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"- Sure."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"- And you watch the videos of people watching it,"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"it's like, it's so psycho how fast these guys go."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"- Wow."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"- And they're just on bikes."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"I don't know if they're hitting 200 miles an hour."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"It's scary."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"- Like a motorcycle's."
01:05:59;01:06:03;"- Yeah, but you know, not like a Harley."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"- Yeah, like a small dirt bike or something."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"- I don't know what you'd call it."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"But it's, you know, these guys are going fast,"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"so people die."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"And one person dies at a nightclub,"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"sometimes they shut it down."
01:06:15;01:06:18;"People taking drugs here and one person died."
01:06:18;01:06:18;"You know?"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"- You want consistency."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- I just want consistency."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"I'm starting to think that a lawless island"

01:09:34;01:09:34;"- Hello."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"- How you enjoying LA?"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"Such a New York guy."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"- I love it here, it's my favorite place to be."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Very happy to be here again."
01:09:42;01:09:46;"I come here all the time, strictly for leisure,"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"because I just love being here."
01:09:48;01:09:51;"I'd love to live here forever."
01:09:51;01:09:53;"- Full-time Deathspot in LA."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Hey man, might happen."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"- What's stopping you?"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"- I hate it."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"(laughing)"
01:10:00;01:10:05;"Nah, it's like, I'm not like spiritually grounded enough,"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"I think, to live in LA yet."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"I don't meditate."
01:10:09;01:10:14;"I used to do yoga once a week, but I don't anymore."

01:10:25;01:10:27;"(laughing)"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"- I know, I mean, you know, you're at home here,"
01:10:29;01:10:34;"you're well acclimated, and I guess I envy that a little bit"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"and I think I could get there one day."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"- Maybe one day."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"Well, before you came in, just before we get"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"into the top five, I just gotta ask you,"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"because I'm getting pretty serious about this idea."
01:10:45;01:10:48;"You know, like I said, I'm a musician first,"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"but a businessman second."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"- This will never come up again on a future episode,"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"I guarantee you."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"- No, I'm telling you, I've been talking about this."
01:10:54;01:10:55;"I mentioned it to my dad."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"I have mentioned it to Despot before,"
01:10:57;01:11:01;"but this idea about buying an island"
01:11:01;01:11:05;"and doing a do whatever you want Olympics,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"where you can take what you want,"
01:11:07;01:11:08;"as long as it's like under the skin,"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"you maybe could even do like implant,"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"like weird robot (beep) in your body,"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"but we can discuss that, but just an island"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"where people can compete and try to break records"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"by taking whatever they want."
01:11:19;01:11:22;"And the reason I wanna ask you about this, Despot,"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"is because you work out religiously."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"- I haven't, though, almost the whole time I've been here."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"- Okay, but when you're home in New York,"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"you like to sculpt your body."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"- I'm a body builder."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- You're a body builder, basically."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"You're in great shape."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"- Thanks."
01:11:35;01:11:36;"- Every day?"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"- Every day, yeah."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- Damn."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"- You know, you work a different set of muscles each day."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"- Copy that."
01:11:41;01:11:45;"- People in the gym like to call like shoulders and arms day,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"charms day, you know?"
01:11:47;01:11:47;"- Really?"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"I've never heard that."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"- Me neither, until the other day."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"So my question for you, 'cause I was talking about how"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"I kind of admire, again, I'm not--"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"- Me."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"- Yes, I admire you, but also--"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"- Thanks."
01:12:01;01:12:04;"- Like, you know when you see like the insanely jacked people"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"who clearly must have had to use some type of substance"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"to get that level of jack?"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- Yeah."
01:12:08;01:12:09;"- I was saying before that those people"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"are like body astronauts."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"They're pushing into places that we as a human race"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"have never been before."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"But you as somebody who just kind of works out"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"the old-fashioned way, do you look down on those people"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"or do you admire them too?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"- I think I admire them too."
01:12:23;01:12:28;"I do think it's brave to enter like uncharted body territory."
01:12:28;01:12:31;"- Also, I'm not recommending it."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"It's risky, right?"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"- Yeah."
01:12:33;01:12:38;"There's breakthroughs in body science,"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"body building science all the time."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"HGH now."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"- Is HGH illegal?"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"- I don't think so, no, because it's used like"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"medicinally too, I believe."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"- And it's also just used as like an anti-aging thing"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"for like people who have some money."
01:12:54;01:12:57;"- But you probably couldn't use it in the Olympics."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- I don't know, probably not."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"But in your Olympics, you could."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"- Exactly."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"If you want to."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"I also think it'd be cool that on Juice Island--"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"- Wait, but it's all about juice now?"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"- Well, I don't know about this (beep)."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"I'm just picking one at random."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"- Right, but your island is about all drugs."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"- It's about all drugs."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"- Including Diet Coke."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"- Diet Coke, because I can."
01:13:21;01:13:25;"- Let's say after four or five years of this,"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"and we're shattering records left and right,"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"and people start to get interested in it."
01:13:30;01:13:30;"People start to be like,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"""Why am I gonna watch the Olympics"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"""when we got dudes running one minute miles?"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"""We got one minute miles,"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"""we got dudes bench pressing 3,000 pounds,"""
01:13:41;01:13:42;"things of that nature."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"That's interesting."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"But then, I think we're gonna have"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"an interesting second phase,"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"and that'll be really interesting too,"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"'cause maybe you will get somebody"
01:13:51;01:13:55;"who gets so inspired by these drug users--"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"- Cyborgs."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"- And the cyborgs that they're like,"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"""That makes me wanna work even harder."""
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Maybe Despot, maybe you come,"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"and you actually wanna compete in something,"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"but without drugs."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"- Yeah, and then if I win,"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"my odds are probably not so great,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"'cause I'm competing against these crazy mutants."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"- It's probably really hard."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"Wait, one last question."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"You know when you see the really insanely"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"jacked bodybuilders, like Beyond?"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"- Like me."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"- Muscles on muscles on muscles."
01:14:23;01:14:26;"No, but I'm talking about probably using something,"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"and it's just Beyond."
01:14:27;01:14:28;"And it almost looks like it must be hard"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"for them to get around,"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"because their arms are so big,"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"even the idea of them quickly boxing"
01:14:34;01:14:35;"would probably be hard for them."
01:14:35;01:14:40;"- That's a common big Diesel guy horny joke,"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"is that they have to walk through doorways,"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"sideways, and stuff like that."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"And they think that's really funny."
01:14:46;01:14:46;"But if you're that big,"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"you probably can't move too fast."
01:14:49;01:14:50;"- Yeah, I don't know."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"You're probably right."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Never been that big."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"- I'm just talking about Beyond,"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"like the crazy giant guys."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"- They have limited mobility."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"I mean, they can't even reach up"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"for a glass on a high shelf."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"- That's what I'm saying."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Would it be easier to fight one of those guys"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"than an MMA guy?"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"- Yes, I think so."
01:15:07;01:15:11;"'Cause MMA guys are very fast and still strong,"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"and they'll just beat you to death."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"- All right, I just wanted to check that."

01:19:40;01:19:44;"Like a car window getting smashed with a bat or whatever."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- Played out, man."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"- I didn't see ""I, Tonya."""
01:19:47;01:19:49;"I wanted to, forgot to do that."
01:19:49;01:19:52;"- It's a cool movie, I just, that was kind of a nitpick."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"- I know what you mean."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- Yeah, people liked it."
01:19:54;01:19:58;"- The number five song of our era,"
01:19:58;01:20:01;"right now on iTunes, is ""Imagine Dragons."""
01:20:01;01:20:02;"- Really?"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"""Imagination Dragons."""
01:20:03;01:20:05;"- ""Imagination Dragons,"" these guys--"
01:20:05;01:20:05;"- Thought they were done."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"- No, no, no."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"They're the biggest band in the world right now."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"- Really?"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"- Yeah."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"- I didn't see them at Coachella."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"- Well, they weren't at, they're too big for Coachella."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Honestly."
01:20:14;01:20:14;"- Oh, okay."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"- They could do their own Coachella, probably."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"- Imagine."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"- Have them play over at Steroid Island."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"- Oh yeah, they would be so sick for Steroid Island."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"At the opening ceremony."
01:20:24;01:20:28;"- Steroid Island is a sick name for almost anything."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"- Steroid Island is Creed."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"- We bring 'em back."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"- Yeah."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I wanna make a biopic,"

01:20:45;01:20:47;"- Anyway, the number five song right now"

01:20:53;01:20:54;"- Ooh."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"- Because it's kind of a rap song, as I recall."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"- Yeah, okay."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"- What, you don't like rap anymore?"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"- Rap hybrid."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"- I like rap."
01:21:01;01:21:02;"- All right."
01:21:02;01:21:03;"- Well, there was a few problems with you saying that."
01:21:03;01:21:05;"(laughing)"
01:21:05;01:21:11;"- Is this the kind of rap one?"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Yeah, okay."

01:24:24;01:24:28;"- Yeah, collective soul's dad, I think."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"- It might be the father of collective soul."
01:24:30;01:24:33;"David's Soul, the song's called Don't Give Up On Us."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"- Also appropriate for Steroid Island."
01:24:35;01:24:39;"- This is the steroids singing to the guys who are using it."

01:26:32;01:26:33;"- That's exciting."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- Actually, I'm surprised that,"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"you know, back in the day when there was like"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"a meme remix song, it would actually often be up there"

01:26:52;01:26:53;"- Right."

01:26:57;01:26:58;"- Sure."

01:29:08;01:29:10;"The number three song, let's go back to 77,"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"see if there's anything that you guys like around then."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"I have a feeling you might know this one, Jake."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"This one kinda needs no introduction."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"So just picture this, guys."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"- Okay, 77."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"It's late April."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"- Hey, are you alive? - Three months old."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"- Jake's three month old baby."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"- Yep."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"- Despot and I are not born."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"- Kanye is still in womb."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"- Kanye is in utero."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"So one of the greatest artists of our generation"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"was in utero at this moment,"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"and this song was inescapable."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"So Kanye West's mom, Donda West,"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"whether or not she liked this group,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"probably could not help"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"but have the sweet sounds of this hit song,"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"'cause baby's here in the womb."
01:29:45;01:29:49;"And if you were anywhere in America,"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"even if you didn't like these guys,"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"probably you--"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"- Beejies?"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"- Nah."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"- I peed and I'm excited, actually."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"- Oh!"
01:29:58;01:30:05;"Now this record came out in '76."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"- Yeah, it says that, December '76."
01:30:07;01:30:08;"- Yeah."
01:30:09;01:30:09;"- On asylum."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"- But this album had legs."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"- Oh yeah."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"- I wonder if this was the first single"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"off this record."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Probably, right?"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"- I don't know."
01:30:19;01:30:26;"I used to cut school in junior high school"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"and go to this Russian pool hall"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"that was in the subway on Queens Boulevard."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"- Wow."
01:30:31;01:30:34;"- And the 63rd Drive train station,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"and they only played this song,"
01:30:36;01:30:38;"like constantly on loop."
01:30:38;01:30:40;"And they would let us stay in there all day"
01:30:40;01:30:43;"and drink 40s and play pool and (beep)"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"and not call the cops or anything."
01:30:45;01:30:48;"- It's not even just Eagles, just this song."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"- No, Hotel California, on loop."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"And they sang it in bad, thick Russian accents."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"It was sick."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"- That's amazing."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"- Yeah, that's all I think about when I hear this song."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Pool hall's gone now."
01:31:01;01:31:06;"- I mean, this is such a classic song."
01:31:06;01:31:09;"- Yeah, we've discussed this before on the show."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"- Interesting that the demo of this"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"was called Mexican Reggae."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"- Right, I've heard that."
01:31:15;01:31:16;"- So I guess that's what the Eagles thought"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"they were making here, is Mexican Reggae."
01:31:18;01:31:20;"- I think Don Felder."
01:31:20;01:31:21;"- The guitarist."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"- Wrote the chord progression."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"- Yeah."
01:31:23;01:31:24;"- And he titled it that way."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"- And it's vaguely reggae."
01:31:26;01:31:31;"- Yeah, I guess so."
01:31:35;01:31:38;"- It'd be sick if they started singing Mexican Reggae"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"instead of Hotel California."
01:31:40;01:31:44;"- Mexican, Mexican, Mexican Reggae."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- Yeah, that's sick."
01:31:45;01:31:52;"A place called Mexican Reggae would be a cool place."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- I think."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"- The whole steroid island."
01:31:57;01:31:57;"- I think."
01:31:57;01:32:10;"- This song has great lyrics too."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"- Oh yeah."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"- I remember hearing this song,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"my parents do not listen to the Eagles,"
01:32:15;01:32:18;"but I remember I was with my boy Wes's dad"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"driving around somewhere and he had"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Eagles Greatest Hits Volume 2 on cassette."
01:32:22;01:32:23;"- Right."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"- And I remember I was hearing this song"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"for the first time and it's like."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"- Really, that's how you heard it the first time?"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"- Yeah."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"- Wow, not classic rock radio?"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"- I might have not been listening to classic rock radio yet."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"- Okay."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"- So I just remember hearing this song"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"and just being like, not everybody loves the Eagles,"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"they're an infamously divisive band."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"Jake, I know you love them, I like the Eagles."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"- I like the Eagles only because of that pool."
01:32:43;01:32:45;"- And just that one song."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"- Nah, there's like, there's that other one."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"- New kid in town?"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"- I don't know."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"- Oh, Life in the Fast Land."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"- Take it easy."
01:32:53;01:32:53;"- Take it easy."
01:32:53;01:32:54;"- That's not on."
01:32:54;01:32:59;"- But, not everybody likes the Eagles,"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"but, and you know, some people,"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"a hater tries to portray the Eagles"
01:33:03;01:33:07;"as being like corny, lightweight, whatever."
01:33:07;01:33:11;"But I do feel like, whatever the intent was in writing it,"
01:33:11;01:33:12;"when you first hear this song,"
01:33:12;01:33:13;"especially like when you're young,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"it is haunting, straight up."
01:33:15;01:33:16;"- Very atmospheric."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"- However corny they might be or whatever, it's haunting."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"And even like those lines, when you're a kid"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"and you just hear this (beep),"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"her mind is Tiffany twisted."

01:33:35;01:33:36;"- I mean, I think we basically know what it's about."
01:33:36;01:33:40;"It's like, it's a lot of people come to Steroid Island"

01:33:49;01:33:53;"is a metaphor for California or Los Angeles."

01:34:12;01:34:13;"It's like a horror movie, kind of."
01:34:13;01:34:16;"- Yeah, the toilet doesn't work."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"- A sunny facade."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"- You call down room service."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"- Get to the solos at the end."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Here we go."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"- What if it's Felder?"
01:34:26;01:34:29;"- Oh, what, where they play together."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"- Well, there's three different solos here."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"So that's one dude."
01:34:35;01:34:44;"I think this is Felder."
01:34:44;01:34:47;"And then right here."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"Kind of identical tones."
01:34:53;01:34:56;"A different playing, yeah."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"I think this is Walsh, that's my guess."
01:35:00;01:35:15;"Then they link up."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"- Yeah."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"- Or they're starting to link up."
01:35:20;01:35:27;"- This part is so sick."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"- Yeah."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"It's such an incredible solo,"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"'cause it's really two different dudes coming together."
01:35:33;01:35:34;"- Yeah."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"- And then building up to the ultimate arpeggios."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"- Yeah."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"(imitating guitar)"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"- And then the bass."
01:35:43;01:35:43;"(imitating guitar)"
01:35:43;01:35:44;"- Yeah."
01:35:47;01:35:50;"(imitating guitar)"
01:35:50;01:35:53;"- Yeah, sick."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"- Randy Mizer holding it down on bass."
01:35:54;01:35:57;"(laughing)"
01:35:59;01:36:04;"And then he goes back to the more syncopated bass line."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"- Yeah, leaving that space."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"(laughing)"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"I mean, it's an amazing song."
01:36:12;01:36:13;"- Yeah."
01:36:13;01:36:14;"- Yeah."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"- Kanye absorbed it."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"- That's right."
01:36:17;01:36:22;"- And look at him now, tweeting about whatever."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"Tweeting about boots."

01:36:36;01:36:39;"But also in terms of copyright and what's ownership"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"and things that Kanye was talking about."
01:36:41;01:36:44;"There's an early Frank Ocean song that was,"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"he had the instrumental to this somehow"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"and he just wrote his own song on top."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"- Yeah, American Wedding, right?"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"- Called American Wedding."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"It was on one of his early mixtapes."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"He posted it and then Don Henley was so pissed"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"just to hear it on this free mixtape."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"- Oh, that's right."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"- Frank Ocean singing over his song."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"- What Henley song was it?"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"- No, it's a--"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"- Oh, Hotel California."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- Yeah, but Don Henley led the charge."
01:37:06;01:37:07;"- Uh-huh."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"- Felder was cool."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"But even to the point that--"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"- Felder was real cool."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"- They see and deed him or they scared him so much"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"that I remember seeing Frank Ocean live in the early days"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"and he played the song"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"and he had the guitars play different chords."
01:37:19;01:37:22;"Like he wouldn't even go for the, even live."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"- Yeah, Don kind of turned into a grump."

01:41:36;01:41:38;"He better."
01:41:38;01:41:38;"- You know what's funny?"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"I was thinking about ""Scorpion"" from ""Mortal Kombat,"""
01:41:40;01:41:41;"'cause the other week--"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- That's a sick sample."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"- I was a little under the weather, and I was at the studio,"
01:41:45;01:41:49;"and I work with a lot of germaphobic-type people,"
01:41:49;01:41:51;"and I was trying to be courteous, and I was like,"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"I don't know why people don't do this more in America,"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"and I was like, you know what?"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Let me just wear one of those masks."
01:41:55;01:41:56;"You always see them in Japan."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"- Sure."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"- That people wear when they're sick."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"I didn't feel that sick, and I had enough energy to go out,"
01:42:01;01:42:04;"but I don't want every time I sneeze or cough"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"that everybody looks at me like, oh, (beep)."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"So I was just trying to be courteous"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"by wearing a courtesy mask."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"- That's very nice of you."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"I wouldn't do that."
01:42:13;01:42:14;"- You just roll in."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"- Yeah, I would just be sick."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"- Well, and then I was wearing it."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"I kinda liked wearing it, but the funny thing is,"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"I'm just not used to seeing myself that way,"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"and when I look in the mirror,"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"maybe just because of my age,"
01:42:24;01:42:25;"I would just keep thinking of that,"
01:42:25;01:42:27;"of Scorpion in Mortal Kombat,"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"'cause his face is also covered in a similar way,"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"and I just kept thinking, get over here."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"You familiar with Scorpion from Mortal Kombat, Jake?"
01:42:34;01:42:34;"- No."
01:42:34;01:42:38;"- He throws a blade on a rope into your chest,"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"and he says, get over here,"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"and then he pulls you in, and then he hits you."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"- He says, get over here?"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"- Yeah."
01:42:43;01:42:44;"- Get over here!"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"- Yeah."
01:42:45;01:42:46;"- Do you remember that late period Eagles song,"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"Get Over It?"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"- Get over it!"
01:42:49;01:42:52;"- Maybe that's where it came from."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"- Yeah, the Eagles took that from Mortal Kombat."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"- Well, the thing is, Don was playing some Mortal Kombat."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"He's a serious gamer on his Sega Genesis,"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"and he likes to play as Scorpion, man,"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"and he was saying, get over here,"
01:43:06;01:43:10;"and you know, but Don, he really respects copyright,"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"so he wouldn't make the song Get Over Here,"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"so he was thinking, what could be similar to Get Over It,"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"and he came up with Get Over It."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"You know, it was a pretty cool way"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"to tip of the hat to old Scorpion, man."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"- Who's talking?"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- RIP Glenn Frey."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"- That was Glenn Frey."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"That was Glenn Frey talking about Don."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- That's not the first time you've done"
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Glenn Frey on this show, by the way."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"You do a pretty mean Glenn Frey."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"- I think it's because,"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"it has nothing to do with his voice,"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"but I think it's because in the documentary,"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Glenn is always talking about Don,"
01:43:36;01:43:39;"and just being like, listen, man,"
01:43:39;01:43:42;"we got Don Henley in our band,"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"so shut the (beep) up."
01:43:43;01:43:46;"Basically, it's like, Don is like the strong, quiet type,"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"and like, Glenn Frey was like his hype man."
01:43:48;01:43:49;"- Yeah."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"- Like when one of the other guys wanted to sing a song,"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"and then they like tricked him into leaving,"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"and then just Don Henley put his vocals on the song,"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"and the guy came back and was upset,"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"and he said, and I told him, man,"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"we got Don (beep) Henley in our band."
01:44:01;01:44:04;"We're gonna not have him sing on the song."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"Go (beep) yourself, Felder."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"- He's the greatest singer this side of Sam Cooke."

01:53:22;01:53:24;"- Well, hold on."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"She fell on the steps of her home"

01:53:28;01:53:30;"Oh, how bad do you have to fall for that?"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"That's a true knife."

01:53:32;01:53:34;"How many stitches?"
01:53:34;01:53:35;"- 40 to 50."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"- That's not a lot."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"- Oh really?"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"- You know the slang term buck 50?"
01:53:39;01:53:42;"When you get cut like this, it's 150 stitches."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"- If a knife went from like your temple"
01:53:44;01:53:46;"to your jaw it would be 150?"
01:53:46;01:53:47;"- Mm-hmm."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"So 40 or 50."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"- So you're saying it's like maybe two inches tops?"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"- Yeah it might not be that,"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"I mean, you know, but depending on where that is."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"- You need 40 stitches to hold a two inch cut together?"
01:53:57;01:53:58;"- I don't know."
01:53:58;01:54:06;"I'm just talking about buck 50 relative to a 40."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"Doesn't sound that big,"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"but you know, if it's like in the middle of her face,"
01:54:11;01:54:12;"it's probably rough."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"- No and also she's like this like performer,"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"that must be, must've been incredibly stressful."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"- Yeah."
01:54:19;01:54:19;"- Geez."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Anyway, shout out to Carrie Underwood."

01:54:30;01:54:34;"- Okay, yeah, I know be safe is not like the deepest"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"advice man, but I'm just saying,"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"hearing this horrific Carrie Underwood story,"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"it's just also a reminder"

01:54:48;01:54:49;"You know, even just walking up the steps,"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"see that's what's also brutal."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"- She's probably walking down."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"- Okay, well, she was walking home."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"- I mean, it could be either way."
01:54:54;01:54:58;"- I'm just saying like, you're doing parkour,"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"you're doing extreme sports or something"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"and you get (beep) up,"
01:55:01;01:55:02;"there's probably some party that's expecting it,"
01:55:02;01:55:05;"but I'm just saying like, how brutal is that to imagine"
01:55:05;01:55:08;"just one twist of the ankle, one misstep."
01:55:08;01:55:08;"- Freak accident."
01:55:08;01:55:12;"- In your own home and you could have to get 50 stitches"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"and be all stressed out."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"So I'm just saying be safe."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- It's like those commercials"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"and someone's just like boiling water"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"and then they pick it up and pour it on their head"
01:55:19;01:55:20;"by accident or whatever."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- Oh, you mean like an infomercial that's just like,"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"do you hate when this happens?"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"- Yeah, and it's like you're cutting an onion"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"and you chop your own hand off."
01:55:26;01:55:28;"- And they're just doing it so crazy."
