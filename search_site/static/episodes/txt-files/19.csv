00:00;00:04;"Tom Crisis, New York City."
00:04;00:09;"A lot of my haters have suggested that I live in Los Angeles."
00:09;00:14;"Well guess what? I just did two episodes of my radio show in a row in New York City."
00:14;00:20;"This time I'm joined by despot Cousin Asher and Jonah Hill."
00:20;00:25;"We'll be talking about Harambe, 1999."
00:25;00:30;"Plus Jake Longstreth digs deeper into the world of Pepsi. This is..."
00:30;00:34;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:34;00:38;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"New Orleans, I felt a warming lean, on my right for chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow."
01:02;01:06;"What's up? Welcome to Time Crisis. Still in New York."
01:06;01:11;"I know a lot of my haters didn't think I'd do two Time Crises in New York City."
01:11;01:13;"But guess what? I'm still here."
01:13;01:14;"Very impressive, Ezra."
01:14;01:18;"Thank you. I'm here more than Jay-Z and Taylor Swift. That's what's important."
01:18;01:22;"I'm joined by my New York co-host, as always, Cousin Asher. What's up?"
01:22;01:23;"What's up, Ezra?"
01:23;01:25;"Also, despot. What's up, despot?"
01:25;01:26;"Hi, man."
01:26;01:30;"But the big news is one of the major New York homies, Jonah Hill, is in the building."
01:30;01:31;"What's up, Jonah?"
01:31;01:32;"Hey, man."
01:32;01:33;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:33;01:34;"Such a pleasure."
01:34;01:35;"How's it going, dude?"
01:35;01:39;"Sometimes when I miss you guys, I listen to our episode when I was on before."
01:39;01:44;"I'm not even kidding around. I had so much fun that I just listened to it and it feels like hanging out with old friends."
01:44;01:47;"That's a lot of pressure. You gotta live up to that."
01:47;01:52;"We did discover that the emojis were blind people."
01:52;01:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:53;01:56;"And that was incredible because I hadn't thought about that since."
01:56;01:57;"Wait, wait. I don't remember that."
01:57;01:59;"Yeah, well, you can make it funnier."
01:59;02:01;"Oh, it says the emoji here."
02:01;02:02;"Fire."
02:03;02:06;"I don't know why we didn't move forward with that, using those as drop hints."
02:06;02:09;"Yeah, I was so expecting you guys to carry that on."
02:09;02:10;"Yeah, it's really great."
02:10;02:13;"Oh, wait. I still have them on the computer. Hold on."
02:13;02:14;"Yeah."
02:14;02:15;"Ancient Indian man with turban."
02:15;02:17;"Wait, that's crazy."
02:17;02:19;"Ancient Indian man with turban."
02:19;02:21;"Ancient Indian man with turban. I guess that's accurate."
02:21;02:22;"Clapping hands."
02:22;02:24;"No, they're prayer hands."
02:24;02:25;"Clapping hands."
02:25;02:26;"No."
02:26;02:27;"Dog."
02:28;02:32;"[laughter]"
02:32;02:34;"Happy face with sunglasses."
02:34;02:36;"That's how I feel most of the time."
02:36;02:37;"Happy face with sunglasses."
02:37;02:39;"This is a good one."
02:39;02:41;"A monkey that can hear no evil."
02:41;02:43;"[laughter]"
02:43;02:45;"So those are emoji for blind people."
02:45;02:46;"Yeah."
02:46;02:49;"A lot of people don't think about that, you know, like all these things we take for granted,"
02:49;02:52;"but that's cool that they translate them into something audio."
02:52;02:54;"Winking face with stuck-out tongue."
02:54;02:58;"To start things off, guys, I want to dust off an old segment we haven't done in a while."
02:58;03:00;"It's called New York News."
03:00;03:04;"This is New York News."
03:04;03:07;"So we're still here in New York."
03:07;03:09;"There's been a lot happening in New York."
03:09;03:17;"One big piece of news is that there's an ice cream gang in Midtown that's pushing Mr. Softee out."
03:17;03:18;"Damn."
03:18;03:23;"Yeah, New York Ice Cream, which started out as Mr. Softee Imposter, Master Softee."
03:23;03:25;"Yeah, I remember that."
03:25;03:26;"You remember Master Softee?"
03:26;03:27;"Yeah, Master Softee."
03:27;03:29;"That sounds like some Wu-Tang."
03:29;03:30;"Yeah."
03:30;03:34;"So New York Ice Cream was some, like, ice cream company that just came out and just ripped off Mr. Softee"
03:34;03:43;"with Master Softee trucks, and they've declared that 34th to 60th Street, River to River, that's ours."
03:43;03:48;"And meanwhile, Mr. Softee is reporting that if one of our drivers goes to Midtown,"
03:48;03:53;"these other guys bring their trucks in and surround them, and they'll start banging on the windows."
03:53;03:54;"Bullies."
03:54;03:56;"You will never see a Mr. Softee truck in Midtown."
03:56;03:59;"If you do, there will be problems, and you won't see him there very long."
03:59;04:05;"Master Softee looks so ill, though, I had to Google it up because I remember seeing what he looks like,"
04:05;04:07;"and now I'm looking at what he looks ill."
04:07;04:09;"What does Master Softee look like?"
04:09;04:10;"What, like the mascot on the side of the truck?"
04:10;04:12;"He's just like, ""What's up, Mr. Softee?"""
04:12;04:14;"Like, he's just like--"
04:14;04:18;"He looks like a pedophile with ice cream on top of his head."
04:18;04:23;"It's like Mr. Softee got roughed up a little bit, and he became Master Softee."
04:23;04:25;"Oh!"
04:25;04:28;"Everybody at home, Google ""Master Softee."""
04:28;04:30;"He's got rosacea."
04:30;04:33;"He's suffering from rosacea."
04:33;04:34;"He's very creepy looking."
04:34;04:35;"He's blotchy, for sure."
04:35;04:38;"My question is, what is this turf?"
04:38;04:41;"Like, who's getting ice cream on, like, 60th Street?"
04:41;04:42;"Kids, man."
04:42;04:43;"Midtown."
04:43;04:44;"Businessmen."
04:44;04:45;"Businessmen walking around like--"
04:45;04:47;"You don't see those guys in the park."
04:47;04:48;"Businessmen having a goof."
04:48;04:52;"You don't see a midday goof, and they just grab themselves an ice cream cone?"
04:52;04:54;"I did actually do that last week, I'm not going to lie."
04:54;04:55;"Yeah, you're a businessman."
04:55;04:57;"Yeah, you see those guys like--"
04:57;04:58;"I'm a businessman."
04:58;05:00;"Yeah, licking ice cream cones together."
05:00;05:03;"The little Wall Street type guys."
05:03;05:04;"Oh, that definitely happens."
05:04;05:07;"Yeah, you're supposed to knock the cone out of their hand."
05:07;05:10;"Like a skateboarder goes down the street and knocks it out of their hand."
05:10;05:11;"What do you mean you're supposed to?"
05:11;05:12;"That's what bad kids do?"
05:12;05:13;"It's the rule, yeah."
05:13;05:14;"You used to do that?"
05:14;05:15;"Nah."
05:15;05:18;"That's just like the rule, you're just supposed to."
05:18;05:19;"Anytime you see somebody--"
05:19;05:21;"It doesn't matter what kind of kid you are."
05:21;05:23;"But you do it to a grown up."
05:23;05:27;"You see a grown up in a suit eating an ice cream cone, what do you feel like doing?"
05:27;05:29;"Saying hi to them?"
05:29;05:30;"Grow up."
05:30;05:31;"Okay, I mean, yeah."
05:31;05:33;"It is true that I've done that before, I've gotten ice cream by myself,"
05:33;05:37;"and people look like you're completely insane."
05:37;05:41;"It's really the craziest thing you can do in the city is walk around just eating an ice cream by yourself."
05:41;05:42;"I've done it."
05:42;05:43;"No social excuse whatsoever."
05:43;05:50;"We got ice cream the other night, and I put my cone in a cup because I felt real weird just licking an ice cream cone"
05:50;05:53;"walking down the street."
05:53;05:54;"It's like holding a cotton candy or something."
05:54;05:57;"You don't want to eat a banana walking around, you don't want to do that."
05:57;06:01;"Or if you do it, you want to break it off with your hand and pop the piece in your mouth."
06:01;06:04;"I have my mom cut mine up into little chunks."
06:04;06:05;"Yeah, put it in a bag."
06:05;06:07;"Oh, this is a lot of bad."
06:07;06:10;"Then she gets it all brown."
06:10;06:13;"I got an ice cream cone before I came here."
06:13;06:14;"Or I just have her just mash it."
06:14;06:18;"The other day--I guess that was last night, you got ice cream."
06:18;06:20;"Yeah."
06:20;06:21;"We just went to the bodega."
06:21;06:24;"How many ice cream cones you taking down a week?"
06:24;06:26;"I got ice cream with you like three nights ago."
06:26;06:29;"I've taken down on average one and a half a day."
06:29;06:30;"No, I didn't get one yesterday."
06:30;06:32;"Yesterday I was with Despot."
06:32;06:33;"I had a little Haagen-Dazs bar."
06:33;06:35;"I thought that was adding character for you, honestly."
06:35;06:38;"It was, but somebody was talking about ice cream."
06:38;06:39;"I got a question."
06:39;06:41;"Despot, you're a tough guy."
06:41;06:43;"Yeah."
06:43;06:44;"You do P90X."
06:44;06:45;"Yeah, just finish."
06:45;06:46;"You work out."
06:46;06:47;"Yeah."
06:47;06:49;"What's the toughest ice cream?"
06:49;06:51;"Or is that a paradox?"
06:51;06:53;"Yeah, well, I mean, it depends."
06:53;06:55;"I think it's more about how it's served."
06:55;06:58;"Like a cone, you're licking that cone."
06:58;06:59;"That's not cool."
06:59;07:02;"If it's in a cup, you're just taking little spoonfuls of it."
07:02;07:03;"It's fine."
07:03;07:04;"Don't get too crazy with the flavor."
07:04;07:06;"Chocolate or vanilla."
07:06;07:07;"Really?"
07:07;07:09;"Yeah, strawberry I would stay away from."
07:09;07:10;"Really?"
07:10;07:14;"What about those like strawberry shortcake or toasted almond?"
07:14;07:15;"That's tough."
07:15;07:16;"That's cool."
07:16;07:17;"That's what I'm talking about."
07:17;07:18;"The humor is cool."
07:18;07:19;"That's fine."
07:19;07:20;"That's very cool."
07:20;07:21;"Hey, I got a dumb question."
07:21;07:22;"Jonah, you grew up in LA."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:24;"They have ice cream trucks in LA?"
07:24;07:25;"Yeah, they do."
07:25;07:26;"Parks."
07:26;07:27;"Lots of parks."
07:27;07:32;"When I would play like, you know, European soccer at my park."
07:32;07:33;"At my local park growing up?"
07:33;07:34;"When you played European soccer?"
07:34;07:35;"I mean, European football."
07:35;07:38;"European soccer is American football."
07:38;07:42;"You know, like people like, when people are on the radio, they always say European football"
07:42;07:44;"instead of soccer."
07:44;07:48;"When I would play like sports in the park, they would have the ice cream man and the"
07:48;07:53;"song always sounded like, it was like, it was all weird."
07:53;07:56;"That was like some G-Funk."
07:56;07:57;"It wasn't."
07:57;08:01;"[Singing]"
08:01;08:03;"Yeah, but it sounded like in a horror movie."
08:03;08:07;"The one, you know, like when it's like, it was all slowed down."
08:07;08:08;"He was like hand cranking it."
08:08;08:10;"There was a guy in the back."
08:10;08:12;"It was like on lean."
08:12;08:14;"It was like chopped and screwed."
08:14;08:15;"Chopped and screwed."
08:15;08:16;"Yeah, it was like."
08:16;08:18;"But these were like parked."
08:18;08:22;"And it was like Metro Boomin wants some ice cream."
08:22;08:26;"But they were parked at, but what about like, I don't know."
08:26;08:27;"They were on the move."
08:27;08:28;"Then they would drive by my house and stuff like that."
08:28;08:29;"And you would hear the song."
08:29;08:30;"Yeah."
08:30;08:32;"And you would like run out with some cash."
08:32;08:37;"Yeah, I went to like, you know, I was like a counselor at this camp and I went to this"
08:37;08:41;"like local park near my house and like it would come once a day in the summer and like"
08:41;08:43;"all the kids would get ice cream."
08:43;08:47;"Were there specific, the way it is in New York, you know, where there's like Mr. Softee"
08:47;08:50;"is the staple and Master Softee obviously was there."
08:50;08:52;"Is also a staple."
08:52;08:56;"Were there obvious like brands of ice cream?"
08:56;09:02;"They were kind of cool because my neighborhood, like, like there's a lot of like Latino influence"
09:02;09:03;"in Los Angeles."
09:03;09:06;"So a lot of them were like Mexican style ice cream."
09:06;09:07;"Senor Softee."
09:07;09:09;"Yeah, like the flavors would be like."
09:09;09:10;"Coco helado."
09:10;09:14;"Yeah, they would just be with Spanish names, which is kind of cool."
09:14;09:19;"Oh, also, I want to urge the young people of New York, like instead of knocking it out"
09:19;09:24;"of a businessman's hand, it'd be way funnier to mush it in his face when he was taking"
09:24;09:25;"a bite."
09:25;09:28;"Yeah, like that's if you're going to assault like a stranger with ice cream cone, like"
09:28;09:30;"at least mash it in his face."
09:30;09:32;"Get the cone stuck on his nose."
09:32;09:37;"So he really has to deal with his choice of getting that ice cream cone for the rest of"
09:37;09:38;"the day."
09:38;09:41;"Another day to show a badass baby kid."
09:41;09:44;"Always want to get the 50 cent ice cream."
09:44;09:45;"Skip."
09:45;09:46;"Get the $2 ice cream."
09:46;09:48;"Broke ass little skip."
09:48;09:49;"Hate going through this."
09:49;09:51;"Get a glass neperon."
09:51;09:53;"Uh, ay."
09:53;09:55;"Diamonds on a hand nigga necklace."
09:55;09:57;"Yeah, that's ice, ice water."
09:57;09:59;"I just get the niggas that call me."
09:59;10:01;"Dunkin' till the vents caught up."
10:01;10:03;"I just get the niggas that call me."
10:03;10:05;"Cause they know I hand the neck."
10:05;10:07;"Lil Yachty in the flesh."
10:07;10:09;"I keep diamonds on my neck."
10:09;10:13;"Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, water."
10:13;10:15;"All these diamonds on my wrist."
10:15;10:17;"Got these bitches getting sick."
10:17;10:19;"Everybody know I'm next."
10:19;10:21;"So they hating on the goodness."
10:21;10:23;"Ice, ice, ice, water."
10:25;10:29;"Ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, water."
10:29;10:31;"Both my bitches your daughter."
10:31;10:33;"Did it once, do it twice."
10:33;10:35;"All these punches in my dick cause I'm rich."
10:35;10:37;"I'm a nigga that ain't nice."
10:37;10:39;"This nigga loving me again."
10:39;10:41;"This nigga love a rich nigga again."
10:41;10:45;"Daniel Bo, Daniel Bo, you always come through here with all these diamonds on your neck."
10:45;10:47;"So, you're listening to..."
10:47;10:52;"Time Crisis on Beat 1."

11:14;11:16;"I'm still here, dog."
11:16;11:18;"How did I finesse all of this from Jane and Weston?"
11:18;11:22;"Girls all in my bed and they don't trip on first impression."
11:22;11:26;"Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions."
11:26;11:29;"I can't... with you no more cause you be acting extra."
11:29;11:32;"Favorite rapper like my son, like my son, no."
11:32;11:36;"Nothing mutual about my funds, about my funds, though."
11:36;11:39;"All you... fighting over crumbs, where the bread at?"
11:39;11:43;"How they feel about you, where you from, where your bed at?"
11:43;11:45;"I don't need no pill to speak my mind."
11:45;11:47;"I don't need that."
11:47;11:49;"I make people pay me for my time."
11:49;11:50;"Yeah, I need that."
11:50;11:54;"And I see your girl like all the time, all the time, no."
11:54;11:57;"I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know."

12:15;12:19;"Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog."
12:19;12:22;"I thought that we were family."
12:22;12:25;"You showed me that we can be."
12:25;12:29;"I got to talk to God even though he isn't near me."
12:29;12:32;"Based on what I got, it's hard to think that he don't hear me."
12:32;12:36;"Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted."
12:36;12:40;"Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like, hallelujah, hallelujah,"

13:14;13:15;"This is Time Crisis."
13:15;13:17;"I'm back."
13:17;13:19;"I'm here now, no, they been waiting for me."
13:19;13:21;"Since I was 15, now I'm yellow."
13:21;13:23;"100 miles and running, uh."
13:23;13:26;"Easy coming, easy good is why I work the midnight."
13:26;13:29;"I'm out of town, shirty, very dirty on the turnpike."
13:29;13:32;"My... clean, I call the case of heavens to the best."
13:32;13:36;"The lawyer said don't smoke, I'm like good love, Buddha keep me blessed."
13:36;13:38;"I'm buying Nike stock when I see these checks."
13:38;13:40;"Motivated by... because it's bigger than me."
13:40;13:42;"I know that I might go back to my old..."
13:42;13:44;"Bring the pro back, that's a throwback."
13:44;13:46;"Yeah, watch your mouth."
13:46;13:47;"Try to talk like you know something."
13:47;13:50;"My competition is myself, therefore I ain't worry about no one."
13:50;13:53;"Not a soul, pot of gold, looking like a stain."
13:53;13:55;"Sucking and wet your mind, see you behind yourself."
13:55;13:57;"You playing catch up, boy, is that your blood?"
13:57;14:01;"'Cause I done blew inside my mind since I first wrote a rhyme."
14:01;14:03;"You're all late, rappers be stuck in the booth."
14:03;14:04;"I'm off state."
14:04;14:06;"Damn pop, the steak and lobster serve my turf."
14:06;14:10;"And the way I chop it next to Oprah at the opera, okay."
14:10;14:15;"If you had everything you ever wanted right in front of me,"
14:15;14:17;"what's it gonna be?"
14:17;14:19;"Lights or the drums or the girls?"
14:19;14:22;"Finally drives me crazy."
14:22;14:25;"Drives me crazy."
14:25;14:29;"Drives me crazy."
14:29;14:32;"Drives me crazy."
14:32;14:36;"Drives me crazy."
14:36;14:39;"Gotta love it though they hatin', homie."
14:39;14:42;"I be on Sunset, still go back to '68, the stony."
14:42;14:46;"Cooked out my basement, drop my tape and get my homies placements."
14:46;14:49;"I play the keys in my sleep on the beach, that's a dream vacation."
14:49;14:52;"Say you ain't heard, I'll let you lie, just know you dig your grave."
14:52;14:55;"No turning backwards, you don't find it, that's the hand you play."
14:55;14:58;"Game over on the driving range and the Range Rover halfway sober."
14:58;15:00;"But when I'm in it, finger up, I'm about decent."
15:00;15:04;"We're all talking agenda, middle of the summer with the wood on me and the feet for the snow."
15:04;15:06;"She a thief in the blood, I'm a G to the co."
15:06;15:09;"You know me, I need Kiki Palmer off TSA for that T.O.P."
15:09;15:11;"P's to the G, P and a D to the bow."
15:11;15:14;"Y'all crazy, y'all losing, I make pop music, still the king with the flow."
15:14;15:16;"This just shit I've been thinking about, uh."
15:16;15:22;"Picture everything you ever want, want, want, want right in front of you."
15:22;15:29;"Ooh, the lights of the clubs, the girls, finally drives me crazy."
15:29;15:49;"Drives me crazy."
15:49;16:12;"Whoa."
16:26;16:29;"Should we talk about this gorilla?"
16:29;16:30;"I'd like to talk about it."
16:30;16:32;"It's kind of old news, but you know what it really is."
16:32;16:34;"It's a complicated situation though."
16:34;16:37;"I wasn't on Twitter that much in the days that it happened, which I'm kind of thankful for."
16:37;16:41;"But basically, I'm sure everybody's familiar with this."
16:41;16:44;"A child slipped into a gorilla pen at the zoo."
16:44;16:45;"Yep."
16:45;16:47;"And they shot the gorilla to protect the child."
16:47;16:48;"Silverback."
16:48;16:49;"Oh, it was a silverback?"
16:49;16:50;"Highly endangered, yeah."
16:50;16:51;"Oh, it was endangered?"
16:51;16:52;"Yeah, highly endangered."
16:52;16:54;"And the gorilla had a name, Harambe."
16:54;16:55;"Yeah."
16:55;17:03;"But the complicated thing was that based on the video, it was very unclear whether or not it was hurting the kid"
17:03;17:05;"or protecting the kid from the other gorillas."
17:05;17:11;"So there were a lot of people saying that it was watching over it like a parent, and they actually have evidence"
17:11;17:16;"they just found now of, I don't know if it was the same gorilla, but another gorilla in the '90s who did the same thing,"
17:16;17:22;"who protected a child that got in from all the other gorillas and got it back to safety."
17:22;17:25;"So now they're saying killed a hero."
17:25;17:26;"It's complicated."
17:26;17:27;"That man on fire."
17:27;17:28;"And endangered."
17:28;17:29;"Yeah, exactly."
17:29;17:30;"[Laughter]"
17:30;17:32;"Well, that's a calculated risk."
17:32;17:33;"All right."
17:33;17:35;"Jonah, what's your take on this?"
17:35;17:36;"Man."
17:36;17:38;"I know you've been doing interviews about this all week, but, you know."
17:38;17:40;"You know, I've tried to stay off this topic."
17:40;17:42;"No, I'm a big animal rights dude."
17:42;17:48;"I think it's so sad that they killed this gorilla for being a gorilla, even if he wasn't."
17:48;17:52;"Okay, I'll just say this because I've read a lot about this."
17:52;18:00;"People are blaming the parents for not watching their kid hard enough, and the kid gets in the gorilla pen, right?"
18:00;18:02;"Yeah."
18:02;18:04;"And then there's all these different sides that are coming under fire."
18:04;18:09;"Then there's people blaming the zoo for killing the gorilla and the zoo for making it."
18:09;18:19;"I kind of fall on the side of, like, be mad at the zoo in a way because it shouldn't be that easy for a kid to get into a gorilla pen."
18:19;18:20;"So I think that's kind of the error."
18:20;18:22;"They said it never happened before, but."
18:22;18:26;"I mean, if it's even possible, like, that's just crazy."
18:26;18:30;"Because of the skinniest four-year-old in the world, he just got in between those bars."
18:30;18:32;"No one else that ever been able to do that."
18:32;18:33;"Or they should have a guard or something."
18:33;18:34;"You know what I mean?"
18:34;18:36;"Like, and I don't know."
18:36;18:39;"I think if it's the parents, it's like, whatever."
18:39;18:40;"Everyone, I don't have kids."
18:40;18:41;"So I don't know."
18:41;18:46;"Maybe you look away for a second and the kids all of a sudden, your kid's like, and they're with a bunch of gorillas."
18:46;18:47;"Like, that sucks."
18:47;18:50;"And it sucks for the gorilla to get yoked out."
18:50;18:51;"Like, and that's sad."
18:51;18:54;"But the kids shouldn't be able to get into."
18:54;18:56;"I think that's like the source of the problem."
18:56;18:57;"That was the original crime."
18:57;19:02;"Yeah, and it's also not like they took their kid to the jungle and the kid went to the gorilla."
19:02;19:03;"No, it's Cincinnati."
19:03;19:06;"But a zoo is a place that people take kids."
19:06;19:07;"Yeah."
19:07;19:09;"So you would think they'd have extra security."
19:09;19:20;"But I guess, you know, I guess it kind of like, I think like PETA would say it's the zoo's fault, not for having bad security, but for existing in the first place."
19:20;19:27;"Like the hardcore animal rights PETA line would be like, why are we caging noble beasts in Cincinnati in the first place?"
19:27;19:28;"Right."
19:28;19:29;"So why is there a zoo for even existing?"
19:29;19:30;"Exactly."
19:30;19:33;"And then the answer would be the zoo's for the kids."
19:33;19:37;"And then it'd be like, well, look what happened to the kids."
19:37;19:40;"And then, you know, it's just a circular argument."
19:40;19:41;"It's a, what do you call it?"
19:41;19:43;"A snake that's eating itself?"
19:43;19:44;"Or a gorilla."
19:44;19:48;"So it makes you think, should zoos exist at all?"
19:48;19:51;"Despot, you pro zoo?"
19:51;19:53;"I used to go to Bronx Zoo a lot myself."
19:53;19:56;"I remember my dad took me to Staten Island Zoo a bunch."
19:56;19:58;"I'm not sure why, because it was like."
19:58;19:59;"I never heard about that one."
19:59;20:00;"Yeah, kind of dinky zoo."
20:00;20:02;"What about Brooklyn Zoo?"
20:02;20:05;"No, but I like the song."
20:05;20:09;"And Queens has a zoo that was right across the street from my house, actually, in Flushing Middle Park."
20:09;20:10;"New York's incredible."
20:10;20:11;"Every borough has a zoo."
20:11;20:12;"Yeah."
20:12;20:13;"So I don't know."
20:13;20:19;"I'll say I liked the zoos as a kid, but I do remember seeing a panther in a zoo once."
20:19;20:21;"I think it was the Staten Island Zoo."
20:21;20:25;"And it was just pacing back and forth on this little branch in this little cage."
20:25;20:27;"And I was like, Dad, what's up with that panther?"
20:27;20:28;"Why is he just doing that?"
20:28;20:30;"And my dad was like, it's depressed."
20:30;20:32;"And I was like, well, he's probably right."
20:32;20:33;"Why is the panther depressed?"
20:33;20:34;"And he's like, because it's in a little cage."
20:34;20:36;"And I was like, oh, yeah, that sucks."
20:36;20:38;"And then I didn't really like zoos anymore."
20:38;20:41;"He did the same thing to me with GI Joe's."
20:41;20:44;"Wait, what about GI Joe's?"
20:44;20:46;"Maybe GI Joe's not that cool."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, my parents never let me have GI Joe's."
20:47;20:48;"They thought it was too violent."
20:48;20:52;"But they let me have Ninja Turtles, which is really big for kids."
20:52;20:53;"And it's back once again."
20:53;20:57;"So I know very little about guns."
20:57;20:58;"I know very little about firearms."
20:58;21:00;"But I'm very familiar with Psy."
21:00;21:01;"Yeah."
21:01;21:02;"Bosaf."
21:02;21:06;"And pizzas with the crazy flavors on them, like jelly beans."
21:06;21:09;"I was in an Uber coming here."
21:09;21:14;"And a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles promo commercial came on the radio."
21:14;21:18;"And whichever turtle was talking said, ""Boo-yak-a-sha."""
21:18;21:20;"The turtles don't say that."
21:20;21:21;"I couldn't even imagine."
21:21;21:22;"Say Cowabunga."
21:22;21:23;"Cowabunga."
21:23;21:24;"Beats one."
21:24;21:28;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
21:28;21:32;"Music's so hot, it'll melt your face off."
21:32;21:33;"Slow it down some."
21:33;21:35;"No split, clown bum."
21:35;21:36;"Your gold hits sound dumb."
21:36;21:38;"Older now, crown 'em."
21:38;21:39;"Where you found them at?"
21:39;21:40;"Got 'em round town."
21:40;21:41;"Could've drowned in it."
21:41;21:44;"Would've floated, bloated, voted, sugar-coated, loaded, hip shooter."
21:44;21:45;"Draw for the poor."
21:45;21:47;"Free coffee at the banks."
21:47;21:48;"Hit through the straw."
21:48;21:49;"None more for mean things."
21:49;21:50;"That blank's the roar."
21:50;21:52;"That dank's your stank lit."
21:52;21:55;"Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit."
21:55;21:56;"Crank it on blast."
21:56;21:58;"Roll past Front Street."
21:58;22:00;"Blew the whole spot like some old ass who skunked me."
22:00;22:03;"These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat."
22:03;22:06;"Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?"
22:06;22:08;"Something is starting today."
22:08;22:11;"Where did it go while you want it to be?"
22:11;22:14;"Well you know November has come."
22:14;22:17;"It's gone away."
22:27;22:29;"Daddy?"
22:29;22:32;"Something is starting today."
22:32;22:34;"Where did it go while you want it to be?"
22:34;22:37;"Well you know November has come."
22:37;22:41;"It's gone away."
22:41;22:43;"Can you dig it like a spigot?"
22:43;22:45;"My guess is yes you can."
22:45;22:46;"Like can I kick it wicked?"
22:46;22:50;"Lick a shot if you happy and you know it as you clap your hands"
22:50;22:52;"to the thick snot of a poet flowing."
23:33;23:51;"I mean I haven't seen the Ninja Turtles movies,"
23:51;23:55;"so I have nothing negative to say about them."
23:55;23:58;"But I feel like kids are getting a different version of Ninja"
23:58;24:01;"Turtles than we got, which was a pretty awesome one."
24:01;24:03;"They're like roided out and like ferocious."
24:03;24:05;"They look like monsters."
24:05;24:09;"They look too much like actual turtles a little bit."
24:09;24:13;"They have talented artists now really rendering them."
24:13;24:15;"I noticed in one of the big billboards that one of the"
24:15;24:18;"turtles wears tortoise shell glasses."
24:18;24:19;"That's cool."
24:19;24:20;"I thought that was a nice touch."
24:20;24:21;"That's pretty good."
24:21;24:22;"That makes it better."
24:22;24:23;"That's got to be Michelangelo."
24:23;24:24;"Oh, why?"
24:24;24:25;"Does he wear glasses?"
24:25;24:26;"He was my favorite Ninja Turtle."
24:26;24:27;"He's a party dude."
24:27;24:28;"He always wears glasses."
24:28;24:30;"I was just thinking more like in terms of who was wearing--"
24:30;24:31;"He was the intellectual."
24:31;24:32;"Yeah."
24:32;24:34;"Sam Rockwell plays like a stick-up man in the first Ninja"
24:34;24:37;"Turtles movie, which is actually a really dark movie."
24:37;24:38;"The first?"
24:38;24:41;"Yeah, he's like a young stick-up kid in the first one."
24:41;24:44;"And his best friend, this guy Leaf, who I'm friends with,"
24:44;24:50;"was at NYU miming school and was one of the bodies of--"
24:50;24:52;"like he was one of the dudes in the suits--"
24:52;24:53;"Oh, wow."
24:53;24:54;"--of the original Ninja Turtles movie."
24:54;24:55;"That's cool."
24:55;24:58;"But the Ninja Turtles cartoon was actually the--"
24:58;24:59;"Yeah."
24:59;25:00;"--my favorite."
25:00;25:01;"Yeah."
25:01;25:02;"You know what I was also into?"
25:02;25:03;"I had the NES game."
25:03;25:04;"That game is impossible."
25:04;25:05;"Very difficult."
25:05;25:06;"That's probably the hardest game."
25:06;25:07;"Yeah, super difficult."
25:07;25:08;"I was playing that in college."
25:08;25:09;"Really?"
25:09;25:11;"I was like finally beating levels that I could never even come"
25:11;25:12;"close to beating when I was in college."
25:12;25:13;"Really?"
25:13;25:14;"Maybe I should get back into it."
25:14;25:15;"Yeah."
25:15;25:16;"I haven't revisited any of those old video games"
25:16;25:17;"from when we were young."
25:17;25:20;"I sampled Turtles in Time on a song that's not out yet."
25:20;25:21;"Oh, really?"
25:21;25:22;"Yeah."
25:22;25:23;"You want to--"
25:23;25:24;"Is that the Vanilla Ice one?"
25:24;25:25;"Yeah."
25:25;25:26;"Vanilla Ice."
25:26;25:27;"Yeah."
25:27;25:28;"Vanilla Ice."
25:28;25:29;"Yeah."
25:29;25:30;"I was playing that in college."
25:32;25:33;"And I was playing that in college."
25:48;25:55;"And I was playing that in college."
25:55;26:04;"And I was playing that in college."
26:04;26:11;"And I was playing that in college."
26:11;26:21;"And I was playing that in college."
35:41;35:51;">> All right, guys, I got to check in with our west coast correspondent now, Jake Longstreth."
35:51;36:01;">> This is the time crisis hotline."
36:01;36:03;">> What's up?"
36:03;36:05;">> How are you living, man?"
36:05;36:07;">> Pretty good."
36:07;36:09;"How are you?"
36:09;36:11;">> I'm good."
36:11;36:13;"Still out here in New York."
36:13;36:15;"How's it going in L.A.?"
36:15;36:17;">> Pretty solid, man."
36:17;36:19;"I had my show open on Sunday at LTV gallery."
36:19;36:29;">> A lot of people don't know that in addition to being a radio personality, Jake is a sick painter, but also a researcher of fast food history."
36:29;36:39;"The past couple shows, Jake, you've been teaching us a lot about the history behind some of these products that we enjoy a lot."
36:39;36:41;"We started out by talking about Fritos versus Lay's."
36:41;36:43;"Then we got into the history of the Fritos."
36:43;36:49;"I'm wondering, this is kind of becoming our fast food segment."
36:49;36:51;"What do you got for us this week?"
36:51;36:53;">> If you recall last week we were talking about Donald Kendall."
36:53;36:55;">> The former CEO of PepsiCo?"
36:55;36:57;">> Yeah."
36:57;36:59;"PepsiCo, as you remember, was founded in '65."
36:59;37:01;"It was the merger of Pepsi and Fritos Lay's."
37:01;37:05;"I told you that story about him being tight with Nixon and bringing in that phone call."
37:05;37:07;">> I'm going to have to check in with you."
37:07;37:13;">> I was intrigued by Donald Kendall."
37:13;37:15;"I was like, I bet there's more to this Donald Kendall story."
37:15;37:17;"Turns out there is."
37:17;37:19;">> Donald Kendall, CEO of PepsiCo."
37:19;37:21;"Tell us more about him."
37:21;37:25;">> This is some very madman kind of man in a gray flannel suit kind of stuff."
37:25;37:29;"Born in 1921 on a family dairy farm in rural Washington state."
37:29;37:35;"He goes to World War II."
37:35;37:37;"He's shot down near the Philippines."
37:37;37:39;"Narrowly survives."
37:39;37:41;"Comes back to the United States."
37:41;37:47;"Then by a year or two after the war he's working for PepsiCola as a marketer and a salesman."
37:47;37:53;"It's an amazing kind of image to think about what sort of existential position he was coming from."
37:53;38:01;"Going from this life threatening harrowing experience in war to being a soda salesman."
38:01;38:05;">> Shot down by Japanese soldiers in the Pacific theater of World War II."
38:05;38:07;">> I was reading the interview with him today."
38:07;38:09;"He was bobbing around the ocean."
38:09;38:11;"It's just like -- >> American history psycho."
38:11;38:13;"He's bobbing in the ocean by the Philippines."
38:13;38:17;"Narrowly survives the craziest war the world has ever seen."
38:17;38:19;">> He's a great guy."
38:19;38:23;">> Narrowly survives the craziest war the world has ever seen."
38:23;38:27;"Then he comes back to America and gets a job marketing sugar water."
38:27;38:29;">> Yep."
38:29;38:31;">> Love it."
38:31;38:37;">> Who knows how much of this military experience really informed his fervent and aggressive patriotism that he brought as a soda salesman."
38:37;38:43;"What happens after World War II in the western Europe is that Coca-Cola gets in there immediately."
38:43;38:47;"They lock that down from a market perspective."
38:47;38:53;"But in 1959, years after the war has ended, the U.S. is engaged in a cold war with Russia."
38:53;38:55;"And there's no soda market over there."
38:55;39:01;"And Eisenhower is eager to open up relations with Russia."
39:01;39:11;"And Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union at the time, and Richard Nixon, who is VP of Eisenhower, organized the first American trade exhibition ever in the Soviet Union."
39:11;39:13;"It was called the American national exhibition."
39:13;39:19;">> I've heard that's a famous one where they're kind of standing next to each other and Khrushchev is -- they're kind of like being catty with each other."
39:19;39:21;">> Yes."
39:21;39:25;"And so apparently the night before the thing started, Kendall is there representing Pepsi."
39:25;39:27;"Like Pepsi has a trade booth."
39:27;39:35;"And he goes up to Nixon and he's sort of just like, dude, how can we work this out so you bring Khrushchev over and I get a Pepsi in his hand?"
39:35;39:37;"We need to make that happen."
39:37;39:39;"And sure enough, it does."
39:39;39:43;"So he leads Khrushchev over and there's like an iconic photo of him holding a Pepsi."
39:43;39:47;"And from there on, Pepsi becomes associated with the Soviet Union."
39:47;39:49;">> So there's no Coke."
39:49;39:51;"There's no Coca-Cola in the Soviet Union."
39:51;39:54;"But Pepsi gets in there first using the Nixon connection."
39:54;39:56;">> Exactly."
39:56;40:10;">> And then in 2002, they strike a barter agreement where PepsiCo is granted the exportation and marketing rights to Stoly Naya, also known as Stoly Vodka, which is like the state Soviet vodka company."
40:10;40:12;">> Whoa, whoa, whoa."
40:12;40:14;"I didn't know that."
40:14;40:16;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
40:16;40:18;"So PepsiCo becomes the sole importer of Stoly Vodka."
40:18;40:22;"And in exchange, the Soviet Union markets and sells Pepsi-Cola."
40:22;40:30;"And so there's a barter exchange where Pepsi-Cola syrup is being traded for, you know, flats of Stoly Vodka."
40:30;40:32;">> That doesn't sound very communist."
40:32;40:34;">> No."
40:34;40:38;"I mean -- but, yeah, so like the Soviet Union is selling Pepsi-Cola."
40:38;40:42;">> So like the one American product in the Soviet Union is Pepsi."
40:42;40:46;">> It's the first U.S. company ever to have its product there under the U.S. government."
40:46;40:48;">> And let's just clarify for the listeners."
40:48;40:51;"We're not talking about like late '80s fall of communism."
40:51;40:53;"We're talking about '60s full-on Cold War."
40:53;40:55;">> Full-on."
40:55;40:58;">> And this dude, Donald Kendall, got Pepsi into the Soviet Union."
40:58;40:59;">> Yes, he did."
40:59;41:00;">> Wow."
41:00;41:02;">> This was in the early '70s."
41:02;41:10;"And then, of course, it ends up sort of backfiring in the sense that in '92 when the Soviet Union collapses, all the people there associate Pepsi with the old regime."
41:10;41:12;">> Oh."
41:12;41:18;">> And then Pepsi goes in there like the day after and just sets up shop."
41:18;41:22;"And as of today, Coke enjoys a 20% market share and Pepsi only 13."
41:22;41:25;"People are like, ""Pepsi is the old communist stuff."""
41:25;41:26;">> That's amazing."
41:26;41:32;"Yeah, because Pepsi was always -- Pepsi in America was always marketed as like the fresh, youthful alternative to Coke."
41:32;41:33;">> Right."
41:33;41:39;">> But in Soviet Union, Pepsi-Cola is associated with totalitarian communism."
41:39;41:40;">> Right, right."
41:40;41:45;">> So Pepsi marketing of like the next generation or like whatever that was didn't fly over there."
41:45;41:47;"And then I love this."
41:47;41:54;"Vladimir Putin gave Kendall an Order of Friendship Award, which is the highest civilian honor in 2004."
41:54;41:59;"And there's like amazing photos I found of Putin and like a really old at that point Donald Kendall."
41:59;42:01;">> Oh, my God."
42:01;42:04;"I'm sure some dudes are probably like, ""You're doing business with the commies."""
42:04;42:14;"But in his head he was like, ""You know what? By providing delicious Pepsi to these communists, we're actually like making inroads for capitalism."""
42:14;42:16;"He probably believed he was doing God's work."
42:16;42:17;">> Absolutely."
42:17;42:25;"I mean, that one -- yeah, I mean the story I told you before about him trying to get the president of Chile overthrown was a little more sinister."
42:25;42:34;"This one is like a little more like by the book Cold War in the sense of, yeah, just trying to import like powerful American brands."
42:34;42:44;"I'm sure his experience as a soldier in World War II informed this like really ambitious and patriotic way of conducting business,"
42:44;42:50;"which to us seems like kind of funny and like hard to imagine that mindset today."
42:50;42:51;">> In the global economy."
42:51;42:53;">> Right, right."
42:53;42:55;">> That's a crazy story, Jake."
42:55;43:04;"So for everybody at home, next time you sip on a Pepsi, just imagine that you're in the Soviet Union."
43:04;43:14;"You waited in line for that Pepsi, and you walked into a store, and you didn't get to choose what soda you drank, and they handed you a Pepsi."
43:14;43:16;">> Yeah, it was Pepsi."
43:16;43:19;">> And then go drink a Coke and see how that makes you feel."
43:19;43:26;">> Jake, thank you so much for this incredible research about the intersection of the Cola Wars and the Cold War."
43:26;43:31;"That makes me think that maybe we should listen to a little song by Billy Joel called ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" because he references the Cola Wars."
43:31;43:33;"Let's hear that."
43:33;43:59;"[ Music ]"
44:25;44:45;"[ Music ]"
44:45;44:59;"[ Music ]"
44:59;45:08;">> You know, man, it was so fascinating getting into some of the Doritos flavors last time because, as you told us, there's over 100 varieties of Doritos marketed worldwide."
45:08;45:11;"But we were only able to go into about five or ten of them."
45:11;45:13;"So could you maybe list a few more for us?"
45:13;45:15;">> Yeah, man, love to."
45:15;45:20;"Doritos Chili Heat Wave, Doritos Collisions Cheesy Enchilada Sour Cream."
45:20;45:21;">> Wait, wait, wait."
45:21;45:22;"Was that -- that was one?"
45:22;45:27;">> Yeah, Doritos Collisions is when there's multiple Doritos varieties packed into a single bag."
45:27;45:34;"So you get a Cheesy Enchilada flavor, which I've never seen, and a Sour Cream flavor, which I've also never seen."
45:34;45:36;">> All right, so put it all together."
45:36;45:38;"What's that bag called?"
45:38;45:41;">> Doritos Collisions Cheesy Enchilada Sour Cream."
45:41;45:43;">> Okay. What else you got?"
45:43;45:48;">> Doritos Collisions Chicken Sizzler Zesty Salsa."
45:48;45:52;"Doritos Collisions Hot Wings Blue Cheese Tortilla Chips."
45:52;45:56;"Doritos Collisions Pizza Graver Slash Ranch."
45:56;46:00;"Doritos Collisions Zesty Taco Chipotle Ranch."
46:00;46:03;"Doritos Cool Ranch 100-Calorie Mini Bites."
46:03;46:04;">> Dina-Mita?"
46:04;46:05;">> Dina-Mita."
46:05;46:06;"I think it's probably --"
46:06;46:07;">> Oh, dynamite."
46:07;46:10;">> Danish for dynamite."

50:12;50:13;"You guys having fun?"
50:13;50:14;"Woo-woo!"
50:14;50:15;"Loving it."
50:15;50:16;"Yes."
50:16;50:18;"Oh, speaking of woo-woo..."
50:18;50:21;"I was watching an Insane Clown Posse documentary today."
50:21;50:22;"Oh, really?"
50:22;50:22;"Yeah."
50:22;50:23;"American Juggalo?"
50:23;50:24;"Yeah."
50:24;50:29;"But then I watched it and found like a more bootleg one that wasn't as like well-made."
50:29;50:34;"You think if I were to make a film like a Spinal Tap but with juggalos,"
50:34;50:37;"would enough people understand the humor of that?"
50:37;50:39;"Or is it so niche that like..."
50:39;50:41;"I'm obsessed with this culture."
50:41;50:42;"I know."
50:42;50:43;"Like, I feel like everyone knows about it."
50:43;50:46;"I feel like you should do the drama version."
50:46;50:47;"Of that."
50:47;50:50;"I've seen like kind of parodies of Juggalo culture."
50:50;50:54;"I've seen spoofs, but I've never seen like one about like the real like drama."
50:54;50:55;"Like what's going on in Ohio?"
50:55;50:58;"It would almost work better if like a character in a movie,"
50:58;51:02;"like the brother of a f***ed up family, one was a juggalo."
51:02;51:03;"Yeah."
51:03;51:06;"Meaning instead of the whole movie's about like juggalo culture and stuff like that."
51:06;51:11;"Like a main character of a film being a juggalo like in his life,"
51:11;51:14;"but other people in the film aren't all juggalos."
51:14;51:20;"I know this girl who went to Yale and like started dating this guy who also went to Yale"
51:20;51:25;"and was like a smart guy, like getting his master's in some kind of art stuff"
51:25;51:30;"and grew up being a Trekkie because his dad was like a hardcore Trekkie."
51:30;51:33;"And would dress up him and his brother and bring him to conventions or whatever."
51:33;51:35;"That means a fan of Star Trek."
51:35;51:35;"Yes."
51:35;51:37;"And then a fanatic, you might say."
51:37;51:37;"A fanatic."
51:37;51:43;"But then as an adult in Yale, he was a juggalo."
51:43;51:46;"And he was just like a dude who's like a smart dude who's a juggalo."
51:46;51:49;"And she told me that and was like, ""What do you think about that?"
51:49;51:49;"Is that weird?"""
51:49;51:55;"And I was like, ""Yeah, it's absolutely weird because you have to be an idiot to be a juggalo."""
51:55;51:55;"I thought."
51:55;51:57;"No, you know what though?"
51:57;52:03;"That's not, I don't think, I feel like I've listened probably to enough insane clown posse"
52:03;52:05;"to say that that's not even an insult."
52:05;52:08;"I feel like that's the manifesto of the juggalo."
52:08;52:08;"It's like you have to be an idiot."
52:08;52:13;"But then if you watch American Juggalo, it's kind of, it's very moving because it's a lot"
52:13;52:15;"of people like finding community."
52:15;52:17;"It's very emotional kind of."
52:17;52:18;"But it's just very."
52:19;52:19;"Idiots finding each other."
52:19;52:22;"It's a very crazy subculture."
52:22;52:25;"Like it's idiosyncratic subculture."
52:25;52:27;"Like it's so out there."
52:27;52:29;"Those guys definitely have a sense of humor."
52:29;52:34;"It's kind of hard to tell if they take it seriously or not."
52:34;52:36;"They just made their own comedy films."
52:36;52:38;"I didn't know that."
52:38;52:42;"There is something like weirdly smart, like the Miracles music video."
52:42;52:42;"Remember that?"
52:42;52:44;"That crazy video?"
52:44;52:44;"Magnets."
52:44;52:45;"Magnets."
52:45;52:45;"What are they?"
52:47;52:51;"Like it's so dumb that it's actually kind of like they made their own spinal tap as like"
52:51;52:54;"a lifestyle kind of like it's, it's so dumb."
52:54;52:59;"It has to be done in that tone of like that Jeb Bush video you sent me."
52:59;52:59;"Oh yeah."
52:59;53:01;"Like the ultra serious."
53:01;53:01;"Right."
53:01;53:06;"Like it's, I can't stop thinking about this documentary."
53:06;53:08;"Like a juggalo like in full face paint."
53:08;53:12;"I think, I think with his hands folded, like really thinking of us."
53:12;53:14;"Juggalos are severely underestimated."
53:14;53:20;"I think the, you know, it's like any, any subculture that people like say is like, just"
53:20;53:21;"like stupid."
53:21;53:23;"That's usually not true."
53:23;53:24;"I don't think it's stupid at all."
53:24;53:26;"People say that about a lot of like musical genres."
53:26;53:27;"IE."
53:27;53:30;"I think you need to get a juggalo here."
53:30;53:34;"It's easy to make fun of juggalos because they're so eccentric."
53:34;53:40;"Like the things that they do are so eccentric to us, but they're, I wouldn't make fun of"
53:40;53:44;"someone in that subculture because they're getting so much out of it."
53:44;53:47;"Anyway, you're, you're a rapper."
53:47;53:50;"I think you should show more respect to your brothers from the Midwest."
53:50;53:52;"I mean, I'm not disrespecting them."
53:52;53:54;"I don't think by calling them stupid."
53:54;53:56;"I think they're down with that."
53:56;53:58;"The clown down with the clown."
53:58;53:58;"Yeah."
53:58;53:59;"I have done with the clown."
53:59;54:00;"Absolutely."
54:00;54:01;"I mean, people, okay."
54:01;54:05;"Juggalos is one of those things that like, yeah, a lot of people talk about, they don't"
54:05;54:08;"always like actually do the research, go watch the documentary."
54:08;54:09;"I'm just kind of curious."
54:09;54:13;"Like where's, there's a song called what, what is a juggalo?"
54:13;54:13;"Okay."
54:13;54:14;"I think that's what we got to listen to."
54:14;54:15;"You're probably going to have to listen to it."
54:15;54:16;"Let's listen to what is a juggalo."
54:16;54:18;"It explains it pretty easily."
54:18;54:19;"What is a juggalo?"
54:19;54:21;"Let me think for a second."
54:21;54:26;"Well, oh, he gets butt naked and then he walks through the streets, winking at freaks with"
54:26;54:29;"a two liter stuck in his butt cheeks."
54:29;54:30;"What is a juggalo?"
54:30;54:32;"He just don't care."
54:32;54:35;"He might try to put a weave in his head cause he can give a fuck."
54:35;54:36;"Let's put up."
54:36;54:40;"He tell him that a butt stinks and all that."
54:40;54:41;"What is a juggalo?"
54:41;54:45;"He drinks like a fish and then he starts hugging people like a drunk."
54:45;54:48;"It's next thing he's picking fights with his best friends."
54:48;54:50;"Then he starts with the hugging again."
54:50;54:52;"What is a juggalo?"
54:52;54:56;"Somebody with a rope tied to his face."
54:56;54:59;"Then he jumps out of 10 story window."
54:59;55:03;"Oh, what is a juggalo?"
55:03;55:04;"A juggalo?"
55:04;55:05;"Who the heck's what it is?"
55:05;55:07;"Well, fuck if I know."
55:07;55:09;"What is a juggalo?"
55:09;55:11;"I don't know what I'm down with the ground."
55:11;55:12;"They're down with my life."
55:12;55:13;"Yeah."
55:13;55:14;"What is a juggalo?"
55:14;55:15;"A juggalo?"
55:15;55:17;"Who the heck's what it is?"
55:17;55:18;"Well, fuck if I know."
55:18;55:20;"What is a juggalo?"
55:20;55:22;"I don't know what I'm down with the ground."
55:22;55:23;"They're down with my life."
55:23;55:24;"Yeah."
55:24;55:26;"What is a juggalo?"
55:26;55:27;"What's out there?"
55:27;55:29;"What is a juggalo?"
55:29;55:30;"Jefferson."
55:30;55:32;"What is a juggalo?"
55:32;55:33;"It's everybody."
55:33;55:35;"What is a juggalo?"
55:35;55:38;"I'm the jugga-jugga-juggalo."
55:38;55:39;"Get the smoke up."
55:39;55:40;"Get the smoke out of here."
55:43;55:45;"What is a juggalo?"
55:45;55:46;"A dead body."
55:46;55:49;"Well, he ain't really dead, but he ain't like anybody"
55:49;55:51;"that you've ever met before."
55:51;55:54;"He'll eat Monopoly and this shit I would connect for."
55:54;55:55;"What is a jugg--"
55:55;55:56;"What the fuck?"
55:56;55:58;"Man, let's just worry about my shit."
55:58;55:59;"It's just rap."
55:59;56:00;"Here we go, fam."
56:00;56:01;"What is a juggalo?"
56:01;56:02;"He ain't a pussy boy."
56:02;56:05;"He walks through the hills and beats down a rich boy."
56:05;56:08;"Walks right in the house when you're having supper"
56:08;56:11;"and dip his ass in your soup."
56:11;56:12;"What is a juggalo?"
56:12;56:14;"Well, he ain't a phony."
56:14;56:16;"He'll walk up in your hand and your macaroni"
56:16;56:19;"and watch you sit there and finish up the last bit,"
56:19;56:22;"because you're a stupid ass, dumb, fucking idiot."
56:22;56:23;"What is a juggalo?"
56:23;56:24;"He's a graduate."
56:24;56:29;"He graduated from-- well, at least he got a job."
56:29;56:30;"He's not a drunk punch."
56:30;56:33;"He works for himself, scratching his hands."
56:33;56:34;"What is a juggalo?"
56:34;56:36;"A hulkamaniac."
56:36;56:38;"He power bombs as he up and sends a thug text."
56:38;56:41;"People like him till they find out he's unstable."
56:41;56:44;"He said, boogey mama, threw a coffee table."
56:44;56:45;"What is a juggalo?"
56:45;56:46;"A juggalo."
56:46;56:47;"He packs what it is."
56:47;56:49;"What the fuck if I know?"
56:49;56:51;"What is a juggalo?"
56:51;56:52;"I don't know."
56:52;56:53;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
56:53;56:55;"That's what I do."
56:55;56:58;"Pump the jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga."
56:58;56:59;"Get the vodka."
56:59;57:00;"Get the vodka in here."
57:00;57:04;"Pump the jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga-jugga."
57:04;57:06;"I figured you wouldn't understand."
57:06;57:07;"What is a juggalo?"
57:07;57:08;"A juggalo."
57:08;57:10;"He packs what it is."
57:10;57:11;"What the fuck if I know?"
57:11;57:13;"What is a juggalo?"
57:13;57:14;"I don't know."
57:14;57:15;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
57:15;57:17;"That's what I do."
57:17;57:18;"What is a juggalo?"
57:18;57:19;"A juggalo."
57:19;57:21;"He packs what it is."
57:21;57:22;"What the fuck if I know?"
57:22;57:24;"What is a juggalo?"
57:24;57:25;"I don't know."
57:25;57:26;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
57:26;57:28;"That's what I do."
57:28;57:29;"What is a juggalo?"
57:29;57:30;"A juggalo."
57:30;57:32;"He packs what it is."
57:32;57:34;"What the fuck if I know?"
57:34;57:35;"What is a juggalo?"
57:35;57:36;"I don't know."
57:36;57:37;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
57:37;57:39;"That's what I do."
57:39;57:40;"What is a juggalo?"
57:40;57:41;"I don't know."
57:41;57:43;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
57:43;57:45;"That's what I do."
57:45;57:46;"What is a juggalo?"
57:46;57:47;"I don't know."
57:47;57:49;"I'm coming down with the ground, baby."
57:49;57:50;"That's what I do."
57:50;57:51;"What is a juggalo?"
57:51;57:57;"Now we know what a juggalo is."
57:57;57:59;"You could paint your face in a lot of ways."
57:59;58:01;"To paint your face like a clown definitely"
58:01;58:05;"denotes some kind of sense of humor, right?"
58:05;58:06;"A wicked clown."
58:06;58:09;"Yeah, but it's like this horror clown."
58:09;58:10;"It's about being a scary clown."
58:10;58:13;"Yeah, it's about being like an unsettling clown."
58:13;58:16;"Yeah, like it."
58:16;58:20;"It's not that different than having a bright pink mohawk"
58:20;58:20;"or something."
58:20;58:22;"What's that great documentary?"
58:22;58:23;"Rich Hill."
58:23;58:24;"It's called Rich Hill."
58:24;58:26;"Oh, Tommy Hilfiger's son who rapped."
58:26;58:28;"No, it's not about him."
58:28;58:28;"Oh, yeah, no."
58:28;58:30;"I saw the name and I got confused because I thought"
58:30;58:31;"it was about Tommy Hilfiger."
58:31;58:33;"No, that's another great subject matter too."
58:33;58:35;"But Rich Hill is this documentary,"
58:36;58:39;"and it's about these kids in a very impoverished environment."
58:39;58:41;"And one of the kids is a juggalo."
58:41;58:46;"And when you watch the movie, he gets so much joy out of it."
58:46;58:46;"Right."
58:46;58:51;"He gets so much from it that you respect it because he's so--"
58:51;58:53;"this guy's a hard life."
58:53;58:57;"And for his birthday, he's going to a gathering of the juggalos."
58:57;58:57;"Yeah."
58:57;58:58;"And he loves it."
58:58;59:02;"And so it's cool to see it from that perspective."
59:02;59:06;"Something that's so easily made fun ofable, right?"
59:06;59:08;"You can so easily make fun of it."
59:08;59:10;"But then when you watch any of these docs about it,"
59:10;59:14;"it's these people desperately searching for a sense of community,"
59:14;59:16;"which we all are, right?"
59:16;59:22;"And it's just-- but the idiosyncrasies are so out there and so easy targets."
59:22;59:25;"So it's just awesome to see it humanized."
59:25;59:29;"I think sometimes people who feel really alienated from society,"
59:29;59:33;"sometimes subcultures where people already have given up on fully being accepted,"
59:33;59:36;"you actually push your appearance maybe to such an extreme"
59:36;59:38;"that it's going to paint my face like this."
59:38;59:41;"Of course, lame businessmen licking ice cream cones--"
59:41;59:42;"Eating ice cream."
59:42;59:43;"--are never going to like me."
59:43;59:45;"[LAUGHTER]"
59:45;59:47;"Cousin Ash with his ice cream cone."
59:47;59:48;"Maybe you feel like--"
59:48;59:49;"I just can't understand."
59:49;59:53;"I'm already disconnected from mainstream culture to such an extent."
59:53;59:54;"Let me just push it to an extreme."
59:54;59:56;"Let me dress in a way that's going to make people think I'm crazy."
59:56;59:58;"Forget it, and I'll have fun with my friends."
59:58;59:59;"And also, there's nothing--"
59:59;01:00:00;"I don't know."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"People used to make fun of Comic-Con 20 years ago."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"And now it's like the Super Bowl around the country."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"No, people go crazy for that stuff."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"It's just a community of people into something."
01:00:10;01:00:16;"I think Jonah Hill directing and starring in the Oscar drama ""Juggalo"" movie."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"That's-- yeah, maybe that's it."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"Because the documentaries are so--"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"they are so--"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"like, you could watch with your friends and laugh at a bunch of shit."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"And then you find yourself very unexpectedly--"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Painting your face."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"--rooting, rooting."
01:00:30;01:00:36;"Yeah, you find yourself at an Insane Clown Posse concert being me as Jonah Hill,"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"dancing my ass off, doing crazy clown dances."
01:00:39;01:00:45;"No, but you find yourself unexpectedly moved by what the people are getting out of it."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"And so there's something interesting there."
01:00:47;01:00:47;"That's just something--"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"I've seen it for like the third time."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"I saw it for like the third time today."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"And I was like, I can't stop thinking about this subculture."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"I can't stop thinking about this as a character."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"And so that's kind of where stuff starts, right?"
01:00:59;01:01:05;"Is that where you just are like, what would that-- how do you express the person?"
01:01:05;01:01:09;"Because clearly the person is lost trying to find something, trying to find friends,"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"trying to find an identity, right?"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"And so that's the basis of like a good character kind of, you know?"
01:01:16;01:01:16;"Totally."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"And Juggalos are interesting."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"And they're so easy to-- no pun intended-- clown on, right?"
01:01:21;01:01:26;"Like, it's so easy to get with a bunch of your asshole friends and make fun of it."
01:01:26;01:01:32;"But it was kind of cool to see it so humanized in these two films, American Juggalo and Rich Hill."
01:01:32;01:01:32;"Right."
01:01:32;01:01:32;"You know?"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"It's cool."
01:01:34;01:01:37;"Yeah, I always felt like when the Insane Clown Posse song came out,"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"and you couldn't tell if it was a joke or not, like the Miracles one,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"and just like all the mainstream publications were clowning on it."
01:01:41;01:01:45;"You know, it's like when too many people are making fun of something,"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"you always like pause and you're like, hmm."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Yes, something's spicious for sure, dude."
01:01:49;01:01:49;"Very."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Very spicious."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Very spicious."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"Let's put a pin in that."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"Play some music."
01:01:54;01:02:09;"[MUSIC - THE INSANE CLOWN POSSE, ""I WENT HOME WITH A WAITRESS""]"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I went home with a waitress"
01:02:11;01:02:16;"The way I always do"
01:02:16;01:02:21;"How was I to know?"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"Oh, she was with Russians too"
01:02:26;01:02:39;"I was gambling in Havana"
01:02:39;01:02:44;"I took a little risk"
01:02:44;01:02:49;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:02:49;01:02:54;"Dead, get me out of this"
01:02:54;01:03:08;"I'm the innocent bystander"
01:03:08;01:03:13;"Somehow I got stuck"
01:03:13;01:03:19;"Between the rough and the hard place"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"And I'm down on my luck"
01:03:22;01:03:27;"Yes, I'm down on my luck"
01:03:27;01:03:32;"Well, I'm down on my luck"
01:03:32;01:03:38;"And I'm hiding in Honduras"
01:03:38;01:03:42;"I'm a desperate man"
01:03:42;01:03:48;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"The fish has hit the fan"
01:03:51;01:04:08;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:11;01:04:21;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:21;01:04:31;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:33;01:04:41;"Sent lawyers, guns, and money"
01:04:41;01:04:59;"And you can tell everybody"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"This is your song"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"You're a major documentary fan"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"As long as I've known you"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"You'll get into a documentary and watch it 10, 20 times"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"10, 20, 30 times"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"I do use documentaries a lot"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"And pick up little tidbits here and there for work"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"You know?"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"Because it's real characters, real life"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"It's way more interesting to me"
01:05:19;01:05:19;"You know?"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"That makes sense"
01:05:20;01:05:24;"Yeah, that's the only place where you could really observe somebody"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"Yeah, and what's crazy about documentaries is"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"The characters in documentaries are so crazy and out there"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"That if you actually put them into a movie as they were"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"It would be too broad and you wouldn't even believe it"
01:05:36;01:05:36;"Right"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"On some documentaries"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"Not like, of course, there's pretty straightforward documentaries"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"But like, if you watch, like my favorite documentary is this movie, Dig"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Right"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And made by Andi Timoner, too"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"It's a great documentary filmmaker"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Wait, that's the one about the Brian Jonestown massacre?"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"Brian Jonestown and Dandy Warhol's"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"And Anton, the lead singer of Brian Jonestown massacre"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"Is like one of the greatest characters in any movie ever"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"And if you put him on screen in like a narrative feature"
01:05:59;01:05:59;"It'd be too much"
01:05:59;01:06:03;"You'd call bullshit because the guy's so out there, you know?"
01:06:03;01:06:08;"Which is interesting to circle it back to Juggalos just for a minute"
01:06:08;01:06:08;"Yeah"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Because I don't think we hashed enough on that topic"
01:06:10;01:06:15;"But if you put the dude from Insane Clown Bossy in a narrative movie"
01:06:15;01:06:20;"As he actually was, you may be like, ""Nah, man, like people don't act like that"""
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Right"
01:06:21;01:06:21;"You know?"
01:06:21;01:06:25;"And that's what's kind of cool is to find little tidbits or things that people do"
01:06:25;01:06:30;"In real life documentaries and like try and pull them into characters, you know?"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"But like music, too, I imagine same thing"
01:06:32;01:06:36;"It's like you really do take a little from here, take a little from there"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"You're inspired by tons of different sh*t"
01:06:37;01:06:41;"And then you kind of mash it up and then put your own stamp on it"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Yeah, totally"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Because you got to use references sometimes"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"Like what do you want the drums to sound like, you know?"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"You want to sound like the 60s?"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"You want to sound like the Rolling Stones?"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"Yeah, you need references to kind of sometimes like speak a common language"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Especially with the people you're working with"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"Yeah, well, I'll notice like big artists like even like Drake"
01:06:58;01:07:03;"You'll clearly hear and be influenced by like Jamaican music or other kinds of music"
01:07:03;01:07:07;"And it's like, ""Oh, he's probably listening to some great Jamaican record"""
01:07:07;01:07:11;"And was like, ""Oh, sh*t, I kind of want to infuse that with the sh*t that I do"""
01:07:11;01:07:13;"And then you get this kind of music, you know?"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Yeah"
01:07:14;01:07:19;"For me, it just happens way more from documentaries than it does from like classic narrative films"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"My AI just changed, it just buzzed the front gate"
01:07:23;01:07:29;"I thank God you came, how many more days could I wait?"
01:07:29;01:07:33;"I make plans with you, and I won't let 'em fall through"
01:07:33;01:07:43;"I think I'd lie for you, I think I'd die for you"
01:07:43;01:07:48;"Jodeci cry for you, do things when you want me to"
01:07:48;01:07:53;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:07:53;01:07:59;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Okay, you like it when I get aggressive"
01:08:03;01:08:08;"Tell you to go slower, go faster"
01:08:08;01:08:13;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:08:13;01:08:20;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:08:20;01:08:23;"And I'm never on a wasting shawty"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"I do it how you say you want it"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"Them girls, they just want to take my money"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"They don't want me to give you nothing"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"They don't want you to have nothing"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"They don't want to see me find your lovin'"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"They don't want to see me smiling back when they pre"
01:08:39;01:08:44;"Knowing I'd lie for you, thinking I'd die for you"
01:08:44;01:08:49;"Jodeci cry for you, do things when you want me to"
01:08:49;01:08:54;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:08:54;01:09:01;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"Y'all out here rob me garments"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"And I'm all fi come inna me apartment, cool"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"Fig y'all dem want the length and strength, action"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Speak low, da-da-na, get in, well"
01:09:11;01:09:17;"But you can't just diss and come tell a man sorry"
01:09:17;01:09:22;"You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story, nah"
01:09:22;01:09:26;"It don't work like that when you love somebody"
01:09:26;01:09:32;"My old flex is my new flex now and we're working on it, yeah"
01:09:32;01:09:38;"And that's why I need all the energy that you bring to me"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"My last girl would tear me apart"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"But she never wanna split a thing with me"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"But when it comes to you, you"
01:09:46;01:09:51;"I think I'd lie for you, I think I'd die for you"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"Do things when you want me to"
01:09:54;01:09:59;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:09:59;01:10:05;"Like controller, controller, yeah"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"And I never wanna waste things, shawty"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"I do it how you say you want it"
01:10:10;01:10:13;"Them girls, they just wanna take my money"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"They don't want me to give you nothing"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"They don't want you to have nothing"
01:10:18;01:10:21;"They don't wanna see me fling your loving"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"They don't wanna see me"
01:10:23;01:10:29;"Smiling back when they breathe"
01:10:29;01:10:36;"Jeez"
01:10:36;01:10:50;"It go down in the DM time crisis"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"With Ezra Koenig on Beats 1"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"So we're all about the same age"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"So let's see, who was born in 1984?"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"You, Asher?"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"I was"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"I'm December '83"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"December '83, so we were all born within about"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Four months of each other"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"That's bot"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"You would have been a senior when we were freshmen"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"In high school"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"I would have beat you up"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"No way, you would have been like, who are these cool freshmen?"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"Let me take them under my wing"
01:11:19;01:11:19;"Nope"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"I'm inspired by these freshmen"
01:11:25;01:11:29;"So I was thinking, because we're the exact same age"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"You know, we have a lot of the same cultural reference points"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"So I was just thinking like, what's a funny point"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"When we were kids that we could revisit?"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"So I thought maybe when we were freshmen, 1999"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"So let's paint a picture"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Jonah, what was 1999 like for you?"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"You were about 14, 15 years old"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Skateboarding"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"Big part of my life"
01:11:48;01:11:51;"I think South Park came on that year"
01:11:51;01:11:55;"I wanna say that was like a big deal when that came on"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"Probably like Christopher Guest movies maybe"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"Were real big around that time"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"I was starting to like"
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Like, Waiting for Guffman?"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Yeah, that was a little more grown up comedy"
01:12:04;01:12:07;"Or maybe even like, Best in Show might have even been around that time"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"Yeah, that sounds about right"
01:12:08;01:12:13;"And then real backpack ass like indie hip hop"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Yeah"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Like that was like the real back"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Back, like"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"The heyday"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"The heyday of like, dilated peoples"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"Like people under the stairs and like that"
01:12:24;01:12:25;"That was really massive"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"Big rap record in '99"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Like a little bit related to that"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"All My Friends Loved, The Roots, Things Fall Apart"
01:12:31;01:12:31;"Great album"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"I forget, that came out around that era"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Yeah, Gangsta"
01:12:34;01:12:37;"I think Moment of Truth came out around then too"
01:12:37;01:12:37;"Yeah, it did"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"Gangstar, that was like the biggest album when that came out"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"Yeah, I feel like H to the Izzo"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"Kind of felt like the beginning of like a fully new era of rap"
01:12:46;01:12:46;"Which I think was that 2001?"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"That might have been 2001, yeah"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"Yeah, so I feel like until then"
01:12:49;01:12:53;"Like somewhere in between like Puff Daddy"
01:12:53;01:12:54;"And H to the Izzo was like"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Yeah, it was the shiny suit era"
01:12:56;01:12:56;"Right"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"Oh yeah, that was like hieroglyphics too for me"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"That falls under the backpack rap"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"But that was like huge"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"All your backpack rap references are so west coast"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Yeah, I know, I was straight up west coast"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"People under the stairs, dilated people"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"Yeah, like AC Alone"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"Yeah, freestyle fellas"
01:13:10;01:13:10;"Yeah"
01:13:10;01:13:14;"Now, what I pulled were the top 10 songs of this moment back in '99"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"So we're probably not gonna get too much backpack"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"But let's just see if any of these bring back any memories"
01:13:20;01:13:21;"I mean, I was still aware"
01:13:21;01:13:22;"When we were 50"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"No, I mean, we know all these songs"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"So this was a really big song back in May"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Are we starting at number five?"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"No, we're gonna do top five later"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"I'm just kind of like gonna do more impressionistical"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"Okay, just painting a picture"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"Just painting a picture of what was blasting out of speakers"
01:13:37;01:13:39;"Dude, let me be your canvas, you just paint"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"In 1999"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"So 1999, 15 years old"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"This was a big song"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Wow"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"I guess '99 was part of"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Jay-Z was doing some different back then, huh?"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Yeah, man"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"This is before H2N"
01:13:55;01:14:01;"She's into superstitions, black cats and voodoo dolls"
01:14:01;01:14:06;"I feel a premonition, that girl's gonna make me fall"
01:14:06;01:14:16;"She's into new sensations, new kicks in the candlelight"
01:14:17;01:14:22;"She's got new addictions for every day and night"
01:14:22;01:14:27;"She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain"
01:14:27;01:14:30;"She'll make you live a crazy life"
01:14:30;01:14:35;"Or she'll take away your pain like a bullet to your brain"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"Upside inside out"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"She's living la vida loca"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"She'll push and pull you down"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"Living la vida loca"
01:14:46;01:14:49;"Her lips are devil red"
01:14:49;01:14:52;"And her skin's the color of mocha"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"She will wear you out"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Living la vida loca"
01:14:57;01:14:57;"Oh"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"Living la vida loca"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Oh"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Living la vida loca"
01:15:02;01:15:07;"There's a little Latin music explosion on the charts back in '99"
01:15:07;01:15:12;"Yeah, my parents were big Mark Anthony fans"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"Something just really moved them about that"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"And that was, they were all about Mark Anthony"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"This is Ricky Martin, right?"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"This is Ricky Martin"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"I think my dad only started wearing Tommy Bahama when this popped off"
01:15:23;01:15:26;"This song sounds so weird to me right now"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"It's really bad, terrible song"
01:15:29;01:15:35;"But you know what's kind of interesting is it does have that like romanticism of Latin music"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"Like Latin pop and Latin like male singers like"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Gerardo"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"Gerardo"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"Love Gerardo, dude"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"That's Rico Suave, guys"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"Yeah, Rico Suave was great"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"Man, I don't know if I like ""Living la vida loca"""
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Hearing that did not make me feel good"
01:15:51;01:15:56;"All of this shit I imagine is gonna sound like what it feels like when you eat too much sugar"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"You know what I mean?"
01:15:58;01:16:05;"Like it's so frosty, like so metallic and like fraudulent, you know?"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Like, and maybe that's what pop music sounds like now"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"But that was 1999"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"Like everything was like super shiny"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Yeah"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Super fake"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Bush wasn't president yet"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"Goggles, like dudes wearing goggles"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"Like I remember when like ""Can't Hardly Wait"" came out"
01:16:19;01:16:20;"And said, ""I need more of those goggles"""
01:16:20;01:16:24;"Like dudes in my school started wearing like goggles on their frosted tips"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"It was very like NSYNC vibes, right?"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"Yeah, that was a weird time because it was pre-9/11"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"The world was happier"
01:16:31;01:16:31;"Yeah"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"We were more carefree"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"Our biggest concern was Y2K back then"
01:16:35;01:16:38;"You could wear a metallic suit to the airport and the thing wouldn't beep"
01:16:38;01:16:42;"The backseat was able to travel in peace"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"Imagine their travel game after that with all that jewelry on"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"You could bring a two liter of Pepsi in your carry-on"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"That's a very different time"
01:16:50;01:16:54;"You light up a cigarette, walk into the metal detector"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"You could eat McDonald's, nobody give you a hard time"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"Oh man"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"How about you remember this one?"
01:16:58;01:17:11;"I like this song"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"This is still a great song"
01:17:12;01:17:19;"If this was released today by like a hipster opening ceremony pop girl"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"What about the other version?"
01:17:20;01:17:25;"It would be like a quote-unquote ""hip and cool"" song I think"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"What about the callback to this song?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"No pigeons?"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Twigs on this?"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Yeah, no pigeons"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Yeah, no pigeons"
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Oh my god"
01:17:33;01:17:34;"No pigeons"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"I don't even want to hear no pigeons, dude"
01:17:36;01:17:40;"I don't even want to hear the misogyny that goes on in that song"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"Can you just imagine what the lyrics to ""No Pigeons"" are?"
01:17:43;01:17:47;"How much better does this sound than ""Livin' La Vida Loca""?"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"This holds up"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"It's so good"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Yeah, good song"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Yeah, this sounds good"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"This would put this on at a party and just be for us"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"This picks me up, too"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"'Cause I'm from New York so I couldn't drive a car"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"So then they say that passenger side of his best friend's ride thing"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"And it's like, ""Ew, I don't know how to drive"""
01:18:44;01:18:46;"And it's, ""I'm 17, I'm from New York"""
01:18:46;01:18:48;"So you probably were on the passenger side of your best friend's ride"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"Yeah, and there was nothing wrong with that"
01:18:51;01:18:52;"My best friend was older"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"They're trying to imply that you're broke"
01:18:53;01:18:54;"You don't even have your own car"
01:18:54;01:18:55;"Yeah"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"Although I don't think somebody should be considered a scrub"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"Just 'cause they don't own a vehicle"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"That's not- you're missing the point"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"The point's not that he doesn't have a car"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"The point is that he's treating her disrespectfully"
01:19:04;01:19:04;"And he doesn't even-"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"And he don't even have a car"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"If he had a car, it might make it a little better"
01:19:07;01:19:10;"'Cause he's just hollering at her in a f***ing way"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"But he's not even like, ""He's driving"""
01:19:13;01:19:13;"Yeah"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"He was like, ""Ooh"""
01:19:15;01:19:16;"At least he's got a s*** together"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"He's got a car"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"And maybe it was a bad moment"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"""No Scrubs"" is a very unromantic song"
01:19:21;01:19:24;"Because it was basically talking about the dark side of courtship"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Well, you also got ""Bills, Bills, Bills"""
01:19:26;01:19:27;"Which is another kind of demeaning song"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"That was a-"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"If you think about it"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"Men's rights"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"There was a real-"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"No, it was like-"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"It was saying like-"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"Together attitude"
01:19:34;01:19:34;"Yeah, it was-"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"It's about that you need to like be able to support-"
01:19:37;01:19:41;"There would never be a top female artist that would release a song now"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"About needing to be supported by a man"
01:19:45;01:19:45;"Because-"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"Because it wouldn't be a strong message"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Saying like, ""You don't need a man to support you"""
01:19:50;01:19:50;"Yeah, right"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"'Cause Destiny's Child ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" was-"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"What were the lyrics?"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"""You gotta pay my automobiles"""
01:19:54;01:19:56;"""Pay my telephone bills"""
01:19:56;01:19:58;"""Pay my automobiles"""
01:19:58;01:19:58;"Although-"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"""Pay my automobiles"""
01:20:00;01:20:01;"I guess-"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"I guess they're-"
01:20:02;01:20:07;"Yeah, I can't picture Beyonce releasing a ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" in 2016"
01:20:07;01:20:08;"No, then they went-"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"It doesn't seem like it would be appropriate"
01:20:10;01:20:10;"Yeah"
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Which is a good thing"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"I think it's a good thing"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"I'm just saying it doesn't seem-"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"It would fly now"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"Yeah, 'cause they chan-"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"With independent-"

01:20:22;01:20:23;"""You can pay my bills"""
01:20:23;01:20:25;"""Then maybe I'll deign to speak to you"""
01:20:25;01:20:26;"That's like kind of an empowering version"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"It's called ""Findom"""
01:20:28;01:20:32;"Uh, financial dominatrixism"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"Wait, what is that, man?"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"A findom is like-"
01:20:34;01:20:38;"They make like shopping lists on like amazon.com"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"And then they have these admirers"
01:20:40;01:20:40;"And they're like"

01:20:49;01:20:49;"You should try it"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"Yeah"

01:20:54;01:20:56;"They let you talk to them after"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"Can I say the link to my Amazon wishlist?"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"Do you have?"
01:21:00;01:21:00;"Not my findom?"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"No"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"Just buy it"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Amazon dot-"
01:21:03;01:21:03;"Well-"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Stonewallnutscrubs"

01:21:08;01:21:08;"Bio"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"But I didn't think it was like"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Pay for it, then you talk to me"
01:21:11;01:21:12;"I thought it was almost more like"

01:21:19;01:21:20;"This is stuff that I need"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"That's pretty reasonable"
01:21:21;01:21:24;"Some people do it, perform it as a fetish"
01:21:24;01:21:25;"Other people are just like"

01:21:34;01:21:35;"Well that sounds like a win-win then"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"Yeah I guess"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"Y'all want one of those guys to-"
01:21:38;01:21:38;"I mean-"
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Be attracted to me"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"But you gotta-"
01:21:40;01:21:41;"I got a wishlist"
01:21:41;01:21:42;"Pay my automobile"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"But the guy's probably like married with kids"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"And his wife is like"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"""It's really weird that we're broke"""
01:21:48;01:21:48;"And he's like"

01:21:59;01:22:00;"Be honest with your wife about it"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"Yeah, don't hide it"
01:22:02;01:22:02;"Don't hide it"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"Yeah"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"That ruins a lot of marriages"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"Yeah, your wife would be totally cool with it"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Well"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"It's not a problem"
01:22:08;01:22:08;"I mean-"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"And if she's not?"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"She's not the right one, bro"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Let's flip it, let's flip it guys"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Let's say that you were married"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"And your wife said"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"""Listen, I love you"""
01:22:18;01:22:20;"""But I do feel a little bit constricted by our relationship"""
01:22:20;01:22:22;"""I will never cheat on you"""

01:22:34;01:22:36;"""Things on their Amazon wishlist"""
01:22:36;01:22:38;"""How would you take that?"""
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Whose money are you using?"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"That's A"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"She'd be using her own money"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"Do we have a joint bank account?"
01:22:43;01:22:45;"Let's say you have a joint bank account"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"Yeah, then no, get out"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"Do we get one as well though?"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"Like anything they buy them, they have to buy us as well"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"Not if I'm paying for it"
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Then don't buy me anything"
01:22:54;01:22:55;"Okay, okay, let's say-"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"No, it's a surprise, it's nice to get a present"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"Let's say that your wife is financially-"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Let's say your wife makes more money than you"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"Then it's all good"
01:23:01;01:23:01;"Okay"
01:23:01;01:23:05;"Dude, you should just drop that Ricky Martin song in the middle of this conversation"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"*laughter*"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Now that's-"
01:23:08;01:23:08;"Oh, I'm sad"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"Now that's living La Vida Loca"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I truly believe-"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"That's what I'd say to my wife"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"""You're living La Vida Loca right now"""
01:23:17;01:23:18;"Yeah, I-"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"She's probably buying stuff for Ricky Martin"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"You should never judge another person's fetish"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"But don't lie"
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Let me ask you this"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"Just since we're on an interesting subject matter"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"I do want to-"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Before I go on, just say"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"I'm not knocking Destiny's Child for making bills, bills, bills"
01:23:33;01:23:37;"I'm just thinking it's an interesting sign of the times of what we're doing"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"By going back to 1999"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"Imagining that that wouldn't be a song today"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"It doesn't feel like the most modern sentiment"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"I know what you mean"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"I think it would be an odd message for a top female artist to put out right now"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"No, because even if you think about like on the last Beyoncé album"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"On like that song ""Formation"""
01:23:54;01:23:57;"She's talking about like if he hits it good"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"Maybe I'll take him to Red Lobster"
01:24:00;01:24:00;"And that's awesome"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"That's an awesome message"
01:24:02;01:24:08;"She also made like 10 songs about being an independent and powerful woman after that"
01:24:08;01:24:08;"Right, I'm not-"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Of course, dude"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"I mean, of course"
01:24:11;01:24:11;"I'm not knocking that"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"It's just interesting to think about that song being released now"
01:24:14;01:24:14;"That's what I'm saying"
01:24:14;01:24:17;"It's also interesting that Beyoncé was the person saying like"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"""Pay for everything in my life"""
01:24:19;01:24:20;"But the times were different"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"And she was like, you know what?"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"I think-"
01:24:22;01:24:22;"I'll pay for it"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Here's my take"
01:24:23;01:24:29;"I think Beyoncé has always been addressing the power imbalance between men and women"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Including ""Bills, Bills, Bills"""
01:24:31;01:24:32;"It's just the solution has changed"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"""Bills, Bills, Bills"" is addressing the power imbalance between men and women"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"But it's saying this is all messed up"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"So you're gonna pay for me"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"And now she's saying I'm gonna pay for you"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"And Ricky's just saying ""Niggas, pray over here"""
01:24:44;01:24:48;"He's over here in the wings going ""All y'all are cray, dude"""
01:24:48;01:24:50;"So we've come a long way"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"On a more romantic note, this song was big in '99"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"You guys remember this one?"
01:24:54;01:24:59;"Oh yeah"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Still sounds good to me"
01:25:01;01:25:01;"This sounds good"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"Damn, this is '99?"
01:25:03;01:25:03;"Yeah, man"
01:25:03;01:25:07;"Feels like it was like '90"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"Oh really?"
01:25:08;01:25:08;"Yeah"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Wait, do you know what this is?"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"This is a timeless song"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Yeah, this is ""Kiss Me"" right?"
01:25:12;01:25:12;"By who?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"You know?"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Cardi X?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"No"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Come on, that's by you now"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"P. Diddy?"
01:25:18;01:25:18;"And the family?"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"That's about it, you know what this is"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"The name of the band starts with 6"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"Six Pants None The Richer?"
01:25:25;01:25:25;"Yeah"
01:25:25;01:25:29;"Maybe the worst name in music history"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Every tough guy has their soft side"
01:25:31;01:25:31;"Damn"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"Yeah"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"I love that band name"
01:25:33;01:25:36;"Was this from Romeo and Juliet soundtrack?"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"No, no, you're thinking of Cardigans"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Oh, that was Cardigans"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"That was Cardigans, yeah"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"That was ""Love Fool"""
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Beautiful song, that's from '97"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"What's this from?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Like Empire Records or something?"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"Oh no, uh, ""She's All That"""
01:25:47;01:25:47;"""She's All That"""
01:25:47;01:25:51;"I thought this was like, uh, Melissa Etheridge or something"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Oh, okay"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"So kiss me"
01:25:54;01:26:06;"Kiss me"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Down by the broken treehouse"
01:26:08;01:26:10;"Swing me"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"Up on its hanging tile"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"Ring, ring"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"Bring your flowered hat"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"We'll take the trail"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Marked on your father's door"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Ring your father's mouth"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Oh, kiss me"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Beneath the milky twilight"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"Lead me"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Out on the moonlit floor"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Lift your open hand"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Strike up the band"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Make the fireflies dance"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"Silver moon sparkling"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"So kiss me"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Yo, you know what would be a good little side topic?"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"All the movies that these were on the soundtrack to"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Like those were the best"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Yeah, yeah"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"All the movies that these were on the soundtrack to"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Like those Freddie Prinze Jr. movies"
01:26:52;01:26:56;"Like that whole Rachel Leigh Cooks era of like teen movies"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Yeah, super evocative of that era"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"No, I mean we can talk about it"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"What do you gotta say about it?"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Honestly, man, I don't have anything to say about it"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"I just think it's an interesting"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"Those movies are like really interesting to me"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Like they're"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"Yeah, there's something about those movies that were like a little corny"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Those movies, that was kind of"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"They were the equivalent to the music of that era"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"And that's why it's interesting"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"No disrespect to Freddie Prinze Jr. or his beautiful wife Sarah Michelle Gellar"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"They're good friends"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"But to me, 80s teen movies"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Good friends with each other"
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Exactly"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"80s teen movies had like a lot of heart and intelligence"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Like the John Hughes ones"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"And then this was kind of a dip"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"And you know what was a good movie about high school students"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"Later was super bad"
01:27:40;01:27:42;"And I'm not just saying that because we're friends"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"That kind of like changed the game a little bit"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"I would say there were good ones"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"Before like I think Can't Hardly Wait genuinely was a good"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"Was one that when it came out"
01:27:50;01:27:52;"I remember"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"I haven't seen it since it came out"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"But I remember us liking it in a different way than"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"We hated on these"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"It had like a real story"
01:28:00;01:28:02;"They tried to make a John Hughes movie"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"That was what I liked about it"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"And then, well Dazed and Confused"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"It was like a Dazed and Confused"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Like a 90s Dazed and Confused"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Yeah, I guess that's true"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"The 80s one, like John Hughes is just"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"Because he's such a dope artist, right?"
01:28:16;01:28:18;"So it's like, it's literally John Hughes"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"Went on a tear of just like"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"Digging deep into his emotional"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Core of how he felt in high school"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"For like six straight years"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"And literally made like two a year"
01:28:28;01:28:30;"That were like bangers"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"You know, he's just a legend"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"So it's like"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"There was other great stuff about high school"

01:54:52;01:54:55;"hopefully it's all for the best, but basically--"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Richard Simmons style. - Maybe Richard Simmons style,"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"but basically it reinforced that Britney's had"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"a difficult life, which obviously I have sympathy for."
01:55:02;01:55:04;"But one thing I wonder is, like, remember,"
01:55:04;01:55:07;"they were, like, the big couple, Justin and Britney."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"- You think he's reached out? - I wonder if they're in touch."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"I mean, I'm sure they both live in L.A."
01:55:11;01:55:14;"- Or maybe-- - No, Britney lives in Las Vegas."
01:55:14;01:55:16;"- I'm sure she lives back and forth. - She has a residency."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"Okay, she probably goes back."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"But I mean, I guess that's difficult, like,"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"that's such an iconic couple,"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"but maybe Jessica Biels doesn't like it."
01:55:24;01:55:28;"Yeah, I mean, none of us know,"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"and it really doesn't matter."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"[laughter]"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"That's kind of the best part about it,"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"is, like, it doesn't matter at all."
01:55:35;01:55:38;"But, like, you gotta imagine--"
01:55:38;01:55:43;"I feel like with--at least in my, like, fan fantasy"
01:55:43;01:55:46;"of, like, these super power couples,"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"like, once they break up, they don't speak ever again."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"That's it."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"It's like the world--it was too powerful"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"when they were together, and they can't even--"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"there's no friendship, there's no nothing."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Yeah."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"Also, isn't ""Cry Me a River"" that she cheated on him?"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"- Probably. - That was the implication."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"I mean, I was getting that vibe off the song."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Yeah, because it was a very creepy video"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"because he broke into her house, though."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"I don't think that would fly in 2016."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"Remember--"
01:56:12;01:56:13;"What is the theme of the video?"
01:56:13;01:56:16;"The video was, like, he creeps into this blonde girl's house,"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"and he's, like, tiptoeing around."
