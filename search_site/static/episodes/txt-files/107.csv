01:20;01:24;"- Time Crisis, back once again."
01:24;01:26;"We got just about everybody in the room."
01:26;01:27;"- Full house."
01:27;01:29;"- Seinfeld back."
01:29;01:29;"- Hey, what's up?"
01:29;01:31;"(laughing)"
01:31;01:32;"- Everybody's here."
01:32;01:35;"You know, just before we get into the topics of the day,"
01:35;01:36;"we got a lot to catch up on,"
01:36;01:38;"'cause we had some banked ups."
01:38;01:39;"- Right. - We had Gratefulsgiving."
01:39;01:41;"Wasn't there something in that episode"
01:41;01:44;"which we recorded a few weeks ago,"
01:44;01:46;"we talked about how Thanksgiving,"
01:46;01:48;"the word is played out, thankful is played out,"
01:48;01:50;"and grateful is a much deeper word."
01:50;01:52;"And then wasn't there something that Trump"
01:52;01:54;"said some nutty thing about how people"
01:54;01:55;"don't like the name Thanksgiving?"
01:55;01:57;"- Oh yeah, what did he say?"
01:57;01:57;"- I missed that."
01:57;01:58;"- Oh wow."
01:58;02:01;"Trump claims that some people want"
02:01;02:04;"to change the name of Thanksgiving."
02:04;02:06;"- Oh, and those people are like bad liberals,"
02:06;02:07;"like his enemies?"
02:07;02:10;"- Yeah, so Washington Post said that Trump"
02:10;02:12;"at his rally around the end of November"
02:12;02:14;"declared he would resist efforts by quote,"
02:14;02:17;"""Some people to change the name of Thanksgiving."""
02:17;02:18;"Whoa, sub-tweet."
02:18;02:19;"- Whoa. - Directly at you."
02:19;02:21;"- Is he talking about people who are like"
02:21;02:23;"kind of calling it out,"
02:23;02:25;"similarly to Columbus Day maybe,"
02:25;02:27;"to recognize indigenous people?"
02:27;02:28;"- I'm sure that's what it is."
02:28;02:29;"- He's like vague as ever."
02:29;02:31;"- Or he might be talking about Gratefulsgiving."
02:31;02:33;"- He said people have different ideas"
02:33;02:35;"why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving,"
02:35;02:36;"but everybody in this room knows"
02:36;02:38;"that I know loves the name Thanksgiving"
02:38;02:39;"and we're not changing it."
02:39;02:41;"That actually sounds like more like it's directed at us"
02:41;02:44;"because people who wanna cancel Thanksgiving,"
02:44;02:46;"so to speak, and say this should be,"
02:46;02:48;"understandably, a supportive,"
02:48;02:49;"people who say we should recognize this"
02:49;02:51;"as an indigenous people's day,"
02:51;02:53;"they're not talking about renaming Thanksgiving,"
02:53;02:55;"they're talking about ending Thanksgiving."
02:55;02:56;"The only people I've heard about"
02:56;02:58;"who are talking about renaming Thanksgiving are us."
02:58;03:00;"- That's true."
03:00;03:01;"Who wants to, I mean, end it?"
03:01;03:03;"I mean, it's a day off from work."
03:04;03:07;"It's fun to cook food with your family, right?"
03:07;03:08;"Who wants to end it?"
03:08;03:10;"That's not fun."
03:10;03:12;"- It is a Native American issue."
03:12;03:14;"Apparently, some Native Americans would like"
03:14;03:16;"to change the name to National Day of Mourning."
03:16;03:17;"- I understand that perspective"
03:17;03:20;"'cause if you're gonna call it National Day of Mourning,"
03:20;03:22;"it doesn't make a lot of sense to be like,"
03:22;03:24;"all right, but we can still get the family together"
03:24;03:26;"to throw on the game and cook up some good food."
03:26;03:29;"- On this National Day of Mourning?"
03:29;03:33;"- Yeah, you kinda gotta move the day off from work"
03:33;03:34;"to a different day, I think."
03:34;03:35;"- Yeah."
03:35;03:36;"- I feel that."
03:36;03:38;"Anyway, I was just telling Jake"
03:38;03:40;"before you got here, Seinfeld,"
03:40;03:42;"that I was just texting with CT"
03:42;03:43;"because we're talking about this"
03:43;03:46;"Jerry Garcia auction happening."
03:46;03:48;"- Oh, what's on the block?"
03:48;03:50;"- Well, it's a lot of comic books."
03:50;03:53;"The first few lots are comic books."
03:53;03:55;"These are a lot of 1950s comics."
03:55;03:56;"- Was he a big collector?"
03:56;03:57;"- Seems like it."
03:57;04:01;"He had 45 issues of EC Comics' The Haunt of Fear."
04:02;04:05;"Oh yeah, there's a bunch of Mad magazines."
04:05;04:06;"That's kinda tight."
04:06;04:07;"- Okay, I can see that a little more."
04:07;04:10;"- Vault of Horror, Weird Science,"
04:10;04:13;"and Weird Science Fantasy, Tales from the Crypt."
04:13;04:14;"I mean, this could be cool,"
04:14;04:17;"a Jerry Garcia group of 39 underground comics,"
04:17;04:19;"'cause that's kinda his era, you know,"
04:19;04:22;"like Zap, R. Crumb, the funky San Francisco stuff."
04:22;04:24;"I think the big thing people are excited about"
04:24;04:27;"is one of his guitars called Alligator,"
04:27;04:28;"but there's some cool stuff in here."
04:28;04:29;"How about this, Jake?"
04:29;04:31;"A Jerry Garcia two-sided test pressing"
04:31;04:32;"for Working Man's Dead."
04:32;04:35;"They think that might only go for two to 400 bucks."
04:35;04:37;"- Is there a buy now price?"
04:37;04:38;"- I don't think they do buy now."
04:38;04:39;"Wait, check this out, Jake."
04:39;04:41;"A Jerry Garcia gold sales award"
04:41;04:44;"for the Grateful Dead album Europe '72."
04:44;04:46;"Expected to go between six and 8,000."
04:46;04:47;"Oh, this is funny."
04:47;04:52;"Now a gold record is 500,000 sales."
04:52;04:53;"Or now there's equivalents with streams."
04:53;04:56;"But back in the day, I'm zooming in on it, it says,"
04:56;04:58;"presented to Jerry Garcia to commemorate the sale"
04:58;05:01;"of more than $1 million worth"
05:01;05:04;"of the Warner Brothers Records long-playing record album,"
05:04;05:05;"Europe '72."
05:05;05:08;"Just straight up cash."
05:08;05:11;"- I wonder what that retailed for back in '72, '73."
05:11;05:12;"Double record."
05:12;05:13;"- I think it was a triple."
05:13;05:15;"- Oh, you're right, it was a triple."
05:15;05:16;"- Oh, that's a lot."
05:16;05:20;"- I'm gonna guess 699 back in '72, '73."
05:20;05:21;"- That's a lot of sales."
05:21;05:22;"This is pretty cool."
05:22;05:24;"A Jerry Garcia test pressing for the album Garcia"
05:24;05:28;"annotated on the cover with a drawing in Garcia's hand."
05:28;05:30;"I think this is gonna be 1,500 to 2,500."
05:30;05:32;"It's like some little Jerry doodles"
05:32;05:33;"and then a test pressing of Garcia."
05:33;05:36;"- I just get the rock ephemera thing."
05:36;05:38;"- Well, are you a collector of anything?"
05:38;05:39;"- I have been."
05:39;05:42;"When I was a kid, baseball cards and comics."
05:42;05:44;"- Well, Jake, also when I was talking about"
05:44;05:47;"how there are a lot of Jerry Garcia's comics"
05:47;05:50;"going up for auction, Jake made a joke"
05:50;05:54;"about a 1990 copy of Punisher War Journal"
05:54;05:56;"belonging to Jerry Garcia."
05:56;05:57;"And I was really taken aback"
05:57;06:01;"because Punisher War Journal is a hyper-specific ref."
06:01;06:02;"- I loved it when I was a kid."
06:02;06:05;"- Because everybody knows Punisher, Frank Castle."
06:05;06:07;"- And his renowned chain of burgers."
06:07;06:10;"- And his renowned chain of burgers, Punisher burgers."
06:10;06:12;"But so, Jake, you were reading,"
06:12;06:14;"so let me get a number crunch on what"
06:14;06:15;"Punisher War Journal is."
06:15;06:17;"Is it a limited series?"
06:17;06:18;"I think, is that like Frank Miller?"
06:18;06:19;"- It ran for years."
06:19;06:23;"- But you specifically were into Punisher colon War Journal."
06:23;06:24;"- The art was better."
06:24;06:25;"- Oh yeah?"
06:25;06:26;"- Whoever drew the Punisher War Journal"
06:26;06:27;"was much better than Punisher."
06:27;06:30;"- Is that what got you thinking about becoming an artist?"
06:30;06:31;"- Oh yeah, comic books?"
06:31;06:33;"- That was your first love?"
06:33;06:34;"- Like copying from comic books?"
06:34;06:36;"Copying from Punisher War Journal, no joke."
06:36;06:39;"- Wait, what was the last show called?"
06:39;06:40;"The Nino Meyer show?"
06:40;06:41;"- Brick and Mortar."
06:41;06:42;"- That was called Brick and Mortar."
06:42;06:44;"Next show, Jake Longstreth, War Journal."
06:44;06:48;"- Punisher War Journal is the name"
06:48;06:51;"of two comic book series from Marvel,"
06:51;06:54;"both centered around, obviously, the Punisher."
06:54;06:57;"First volume ran from '88 to '95,"
06:57;06:59;"and then they did another series."
06:59;07:00;"- Hell of a run."
07:00;07:02;"- 2007 to 2009."
07:02;07:04;"- So you liked Punisher War Journal."
07:04;07:07;"You didn't like the more fantastical superheroes?"
07:07;07:09;"- No, no, no, I'm a hard realist, you know that."
07:09;07:12;"- No superpowers, you just want machine guns?"
07:12;07:13;"- Yeah."
07:13;07:14;"- Raw violence?"
07:14;07:15;"- Absolutely, no."
07:15;07:18;"You notice that the series ran till '95."
07:18;07:18;"- Pretty deep."
07:18;07:19;"Were you with it up till the end?"
07:19;07:23;"- Well, I mean, maybe Jerry was a huge head."
07:23;07:24;"- Oh, the same year he died?"
07:24;07:26;"- Word got back that he died,"
07:26;07:28;"and the creators of Punisher War Journal were like,"
07:28;07:30;"""We're shutting this down."""
07:30;07:31;"- That'd be tight."
07:31;07:33;"- That'd be so amazing."
07:33;07:35;"The complete Punisher War Journal first run"
07:35;07:38;"from Jerry Garcia's archives."
07:38;07:40;"- And then you flip open each one,"
07:40;07:41;"and then just delicate handwriting,"
07:41;07:44;"like him in his late 40s, early 50s,"
07:44;07:47;"write, ""Please return to Jerry Garcia."""
07:47;07:48;"- Oh my God."

08:46;08:48;"are from the 50s and 60s,"
08:48;08:51;"but I do love this idea that Jerry was keeping up"
08:51;08:55;"with Punisher War Journal up until the end."
08:55;08:57;"Punisher War Journal is just like such an intense name."
08:57;08:58;"It's a great name."
08:58;09:01;"This kind of makes me want to read Punisher War Journal."
09:01;09:02;"'Cause I was the opposite."
09:02;09:04;"I think I've said this before on the program"
09:04;09:06;"that I was such a big X-Men fan,"
09:06;09:08;"kind of to the exclusion of all other--"
09:08;09:09;"- Did you collect?"
09:09;09:10;"- Yeah."
09:10;09:11;"- You still have them?"
09:11;09:12;"- I think they're in my parents' houses."
09:12;09:13;"I got to get them."
09:13;09:15;"- Ezra Koenig auction."
09:16;09:19;"- I had the complete run of something called"
09:19;09:21;"The Age of Apocalypse,"
09:21;09:23;"which was a very fascinating moment"
09:23;09:25;"when it's kind of convoluted"
09:25;09:28;"and maybe it played out in some of the movies,"
09:28;09:31;"but basically Professor X's son goes back in time"
09:31;09:34;"and kills him, creating a new timeline"
09:34;09:36;"where Professor X having died,"
09:36;09:40;"kind of anti-mutant sentiment takes over part of the world,"
09:40;09:43;"but also the mutants led by Apocalypse"
09:43;09:44;"take over another part."
09:44;09:44;"It's cool."
09:44;09:47;"- Yeah, it's a alternate universe and Magneto's a good guy."
09:47;09:51;"Anyway, it was a limited run across all the X-Men properties."
09:51;09:54;"Shout out to anybody who worked on The Age of Apocalypse."
09:54;09:56;"But I was so into X-Men 'cause I liked the vibe"
09:56;09:57;"and I thought the way that they dealt"
09:57;10:00;"with the concept of superpowers made a lot of sense."
10:00;10:02;"But I'd see Punisher and I'd just be like,"
10:02;10:03;"this is mindless violence."
10:03;10:04;"- Bleak."
10:04;10:05;"- Maybe now that I'm older,"
10:05;10:08;"I understand that Punisher had a more accurate worldview."
10:08;10:11;"You understood that."
10:11;10:12;"- Well, yeah."
10:12;10:12;"I mean, he was just a vigilante."
10:12;10:16;"It was just raw sorrow that drove him."
10:16;10:18;"- You know one thing that I've been thinking,"
10:18;10:22;"this is classic TC, just picking up on an ice cold"
10:22;10:23;"- Oh, please. - news story."
10:23;10:24;"- Let's crack that open."
10:24;10:26;"- Maybe we talk about this a little bit on the show,"
10:26;10:27;"but you know there's this whole thing"
10:27;10:30;"that Martin Scorsese said he didn't like Marvel movies"
10:30;10:33;"and it upended American society."
10:33;10:34;"- It really did."
10:34;10:35;"- For about a month."
10:35;10:35;"- Fully agree with the man."
10:35;10:37;"- Everybody knows about this."
10:37;10:37;"- Yep."
10:37;10:38;"- And then people--"
10:38;10:39;"- This is ice cold, by the way."
10:39;10:41;"- People were, yeah."
10:41;10:42;"Well, although it was reignited a little bit"
10:42;10:44;"'cause the Irishman finally hit Netflix."
10:44;10:44;"- Right."
10:44;10:48;"- So people were so infuriated."
10:48;10:51;"And to be fair to the offended parties,"
10:51;10:53;"Scorsese didn't just say they're not for me."
10:53;10:56;"He said, they're not cinema, whatever that means."
10:56;10:56;"So you could understand--"
10:56;10:59;"- He means like they're not like high art."
10:59;11:01;"- Yeah, he said they're like theme parks."
11:01;11:02;"- Right."
11:02;11:03;"- Which isn't the worst diss in the world."
11:03;11:04;"People like theme parks."
11:04;11:05;"- Absolutely."
11:05;11:06;"- You could have said they're garbage."
11:06;11:07;"Theme parks are fun."
11:07;11:10;"But so people got so upset and it became this whole thing."
11:10;11:12;"And then I feel like they were dragging"
11:12;11:13;"like Coppola into the mix."
11:13;11:15;"Now it became a thing that every like serious director"
11:15;11:17;"has to be asked about it."
11:17;11:19;"And then the directors of the Marvel movies"
11:19;11:20;"were so offended."
11:20;11:24;"James Gunn, who directed ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"""
11:24;11:26;"he tweeted or posted something"
11:26;11:27;"about how disappointed he was."
11:27;11:29;"- Hey, I worked hard on that."
11:29;11:30;"- Kind of."
11:30;11:32;"And then the Irishman came out."
11:32;11:35;"Yeah, now it's payback time, Marty."
11:35;11:35;"And from what I understand,"
11:35;11:38;"I actually haven't seen this with my own eyes,"
11:38;11:40;"but I've seen a lot of people saying,"
11:40;11:43;"""Oh my God, film Twitter is a mess."""
11:43;11:47;"Because the Irishman, also now anybody can watch it"
11:47;11:49;"because it's on streaming on Netflix."
11:49;11:51;"So, you know, let's say you were offended"
11:51;11:53;"by Marty's comments before,"
11:53;11:55;"you might just not go see the film."
11:55;11:56;"But now it's a perfect storm"
11:56;12:00;"because all these aggrieved Marvel fans"
12:00;12:03;"can throw on the first 15 minutes of ""Irishman"""
12:03;12:04;"just enough that they can say,"
12:04;12:07;"""I tried to watch it, but that guy (beep) sucks."""
12:07;12:09;"But I just had a thought,"
12:09;12:11;"and I'm sure somebody must've said this,"
12:11;12:13;"and I'm surprised that this wasn't a bigger part of it."
12:13;12:14;"And maybe this is on Scorsese."
12:14;12:15;"He didn't know what he was getting into,"
12:15;12:17;"and even in his op-ed,"
12:17;12:20;"he didn't define his terms very clearly."
12:20;12:22;"But I think the easiest argument"
12:22;12:26;"for why you might call a Scorsese movie cinema"
12:26;12:28;"and a Marvel movie not cinema"
12:28;12:31;"would just be that I like stories"
12:31;12:34;"about people with the capacities"
12:34;12:36;"and abilities of normal humans."
12:37;12:38;"(laughs)"
12:38;12:39;"Like, 'cause the truth is-"
12:39;12:40;"- Yeah, that's very my vibe."
12:40;12:43;"- That doesn't neglect fantasy or sci-fi."
12:43;12:46;"You could make a movie that takes place on Mars."
12:46;12:47;"Humans have never set foot on Mars."
12:47;12:49;"- ""Martian,"" great film."
12:49;12:50;"- Yeah."
12:50;12:52;"You could make a movie about people"
12:52;12:56;"going to a place that humans have never been at,"
12:56;12:58;"but you just don't give them superpowers."
12:58;12:59;"I actually buy that as an argument."
12:59;13:00;"I'm not saying I fully agree with it,"
13:00;13:02;"but you could make the case that,"
13:02;13:04;"to him, the definition of cinemas,"
13:04;13:05;"and he did say something,"
13:05;13:07;"it's about real human emotions and relationships."
13:07;13:11;"He could say, ""I just find the superpowers part"
13:11;13:14;"muddies the waters a bit."""
13:14;13:15;"And he could say, ""You know, it's the same reason"
13:15;13:18;"why people at first were so into 'Game of Thrones.'"""
13:18;13:20;"They're like, ""Okay, there are dragons."
13:20;13:22;"It does take place in a fantastical realm,"
13:22;13:25;"but they're real people dealing with real (beep)."""
13:25;13:27;"And for the most part, they are just normal human beings."
13:27;13:28;"- Sure."
13:28;13:29;"- There's the White Walkers and stuff,"
13:29;13:31;"but the people are-"
13:31;13:31;"- Mortal."
13:31;13:33;"- Their people are mortal."
13:33;13:34;"I'd buy that."
13:34;13:37;"I'm not saying you can't read into a Marvel movie"
13:37;13:41;"and take away, find something that speaks to your humanity,"
13:41;13:44;"but I could understand that as to draw a line in the sand"
13:44;13:47;"and say, ""I like human relationships"
13:47;13:48;"where they're mere mortals."""
13:48;13:49;"- What about ""Joker""?"
13:49;13:50;"It's a superhero movie,"
13:50;13:52;"but he doesn't have any special powers."
13:52;13:53;"- That's cinema."
13:53;13:55;"- Oh, and it's an homage to Scorsese."
13:55;13:57;"- Mr. Scorsese, have you seen ""Joker""?"
13:57;13:59;"I'm sure there were so many tweets like that."
13:59;13:59;"- It is interesting."
13:59;14:01;"- Mr. Scorsese, I implore you to see ""Joker."""
14:01;14:02;"- I implore you."
14:02;14:04;"- It is interesting."
14:04;14:05;"Maybe this is a coincidence,"
14:05;14:08;"but Batman is the only superhero"
14:08;14:11;"that's purely just a mortal human with no superpowers."
14:11;14:14;"And all those movies were made by auteur filmmakers,"
14:14;14:17;"Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, whoever else."
14:17;14:18;"I don't know."
14:18;14:19;"But those are the two big ones."
14:19;14:20;"- That's a good point."
14:20;14:21;"- I don't know."
14:21;14:23;"- Recently, guys, we're just catching you up"
14:23;14:26;"on the past three months of comic book movie discourse."
14:26;14:28;"- Really, the last 30 years."
14:28;14:30;"- Kind of the last 30 years."
14:30;14:31;"'Cause I also saw there was some tweet"
14:31;14:34;"that, again, people were fighting about."
14:34;14:35;"And who knows if this is even true,"
14:35;14:40;"that said the DCU, it really should be the DCCU, right?"
14:40;14:43;"'Cause it's the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Comics."
14:43;14:46;"It should be the DC Cinematic Universe."
14:46;14:48;"Or it should be the DCCCU."
14:48;14:51;"- The D-double-C-U?"
14:51;14:52;"- D-triple-C."
14:52;14:53;"- Triple-C."
14:53;14:54;"Oh, the D-triple-C."
14:54;14:56;"- So the D-triple-C-U."
14:56;14:59;"Somebody said that they don't know what to do with Superman."
14:59;15:02;"And it's interesting that DC has Batman and Superman"
15:02;15:03;"because they're opposites."
15:03;15:04;"- Right."
15:04;15:06;"- Batman is as mortal as it gets,"
15:06;15:08;"whereas Superman is kind of like the,"
15:08;15:09;"you know, as the name implies,"
15:09;15:11;"he's almost like the purest superhero."
15:11;15:13;"And he has an interesting backstory."
15:13;15:16;"He's an orphan, he's an immigrant."
15:16;15:17;"- Had a hard life."
15:17;15:18;"- He's had a hard life,"
15:18;15:21;"but his powers are just like so out of control powerful."
15:21;15:22;"- Tough to relate."
15:22;15:23;"- Yeah."
15:23;15:24;"- Never was a fan of Superman."
15:24;15:26;"- Yeah, there's something about it that's not--"
15:26;15:30;"just, it's corny, it's wholesome, it's aspirational."
15:30;15:30;"I don't like it."
15:30;15:31;"- And I saw some people being like,"
15:31;15:34;"well, oh, you're telling me that Superman,"
15:34;15:36;"an orphaned immigrant in a society"
15:36;15:38;"that doesn't understand him, people can't relate to that?"
15:38;15:41;"And I was kind of thinking like, yeah, I don't think so."
15:41;15:44;"I think he probably, there have been so many movies"
15:44;15:46;"that deal with those issues"
15:46;15:48;"probably a little more accurately."
15:48;15:50;"You know a movie that deals with the immigrants"
15:50;15:52;"making their way into society that doesn't understand them?"
15:52;15:53;"- The Irishman."
15:53;15:54;"- Oh, yeah."
15:54;15:56;"- Did you like The Irishman, Ezra?"
15:56;15:57;"Did you see it?"
15:57;15:58;"- I loved it."
15:58;15:59;"- Yeah, I saw it in the theater, it was great."
15:59;16:01;"- Yeah, I saw it in the theater too."
16:01;16:02;"- Which you kind of need to do."
16:02;16:03;"I would have stopped it like four times"
16:03;16:04;"if I watched it at home."
16:04;16:05;"- I know."
16:05;16:07;"- And I will watch it again at some point,"
16:07;16:08;"but I will also stop it four times."
16:08;16:11;"- I can't imagine just watching that on your laptop."
16:11;16:13;"- Like holding a (beep)"
16:13;16:14;"- Yeah."
16:14;16:15;"- Like in the theater, the last hour,"
16:15;16:17;"I was just holding a (beep)"
16:17;16:18;"- Brilliant."
16:18;16:18;"- And then just, but like doing that at home"
16:18;16:21;"would be so tight, just like pushing start,"
16:21;16:22;"not gonna stop it."
16:22;16:23;"- Babe, I'm watching The Irishman."
16:23;16:24;"- Don't open the door."
16:24;16:26;"- Do not open the door."
16:26;16:28;"- And if you see me open the door to use the bathroom,"
16:28;16:29;"reprimand me."
16:29;16:30;"- Reprimand."

17:54;17:57;"a superhero without the superpowers."
17:57;17:58;"- Oh, it's just the suit?"
17:58;17:59;"- It's yeah, he's a,"
17:59;18:01;"Robert Downey Jr. doesn't have any special,"
18:01;18:04;"like radioactive blood or anything like that."
18:04;18:05;"- Right."
18:05;18:05;"- He has money, he's like Batman."
18:05;18:07;"- Right, he kinda is, yeah, you're right."
18:07;18:10;"- There is something interesting about Iron Man, I guess."
18:10;18:12;"- Yeah, it seems like a Batman rip off though."
18:12;18:17;"Rich guy with like technological tools at his disposal."
18:17;18:17;"- He does it himself though."
18:17;18:19;"He's got the engineering skills."
18:19;18:21;"He's not like Alfred, like who makes Batman?"
18:21;18:24;"Oh, it's like Morgan Freeman makes all of Batman's"
18:24;18:25;"special tech."
18:25;18:26;"- Right."
18:26;18:28;"- Downey Jr. is in there with his elbow, you know,"
18:28;18:31;"his sleeves rolled up, turning screws and."
18:31;18:32;"- Yeah, elbow grease."
18:32;18:34;"- Yeah, yeah, putting in some classic elbow grease."
18:34;18:36;"This is full comics talk."
18:36;18:38;"- I mean, we got into this 'cause of Jerry's collection."
18:38;18:40;"- Okay, right, so it actually is pretty connected"
18:40;18:41;"to classic TC stuff."
18:41;18:43;"Well, also when you look through Jerry's collection."
18:43;18:44;"- It does go back to the Grateful Dead,"
18:44;18:47;"so don't worry listeners of the show."
18:47;18:49;"- Look, I'm not saying that this is indicative"
18:49;18:53;"of Jerry's entire comic collection,"
18:53;18:55;"'cause for all we know, they've been doing,"
18:55;18:58;"you know, auctioning this stuff off little by little."
18:58;18:59;"- Big fan of Wolverine."
18:59;19:01;"(laughing)"
19:01;19:03;"- Wolverine is tight 'cause he's almost a normal guy"
19:03;19:05;"just with claws."
19:05;19:05;"But I--"
19:05;19:06;"- Big fan of Spawn."
19:06;19:09;"- But actually when you look through Jerry's collection."
19:09;19:10;"- It's the funny stuff."
19:10;19:12;"- Well, it's funny stuff, but it's also like,"
19:12;19:15;"shock, suspense, it's also just like classic,"
19:15;19:16;"like horror and gore."
19:16;19:18;"It's not that specific superhero genre."
19:18;19:20;"I'm not seeing a lot of superheroes in here."
19:20;19:22;"You see some Spider-Man in there?"
19:22;19:23;"Oh, I didn't see this one."
19:23;19:26;"Okay, I was totally wrong, I missed this lot."
19:26;19:28;"There's so many lots of his comics."
19:28;19:30;"So there is a lot-- - Why would you want this?"
19:30;19:32;"- Lot, because you're a Grateful Dead fan, Jake,"
19:32;19:34;"which I thought you were."
19:34;19:34;"Okay, so there is a lot--"
19:34;19:38;"- It's so removed from his artistic achievement"
19:38;19:39;"at that point."
19:39;19:42;"It's just sort of like, Jerry's cookbook collection."
19:42;19:45;"Jerry's copy of Joy of Cooking."
19:45;19:46;"Cool."
19:46;19:50;"- I mean, it helps you understand"
19:50;19:51;"where he was coming from, you know?"
19:51;19:52;"This is his--"
19:52;19:55;"- Jerry's copy of the Oxford English Dictionary."
19:55;19:56;"- There you go."
19:56;19:59;"- With a little magnifying glass included."
19:59;20:03;"- Lot 312 in this auction is a Jerry Garcia group"
20:03;20:08;"of 66 assorted DC/Marvel comics, 1960s through 1980s."
20:08;20:10;"- I wanna know about that '80s stuff."
20:10;20:13;"- Okay, in the picture you can see Spider-Man,"
20:13;20:15;"there is some Captain America."
20:15;20:18;"- That could totally be like a dead song, Captain America."
20:18;20:19;"- Oh yeah, like in US blues?"
20:19;20:20;"- Yeah."
20:20;20:22;"♪ Captain America ♪"
20:22;20:25;"♪ Captain America ♪"
20:25;20:27;"- I feel like this one might be Alpha Force,"
20:27;20:28;"which is really, do you know who Alpha Force is?"
20:28;20:29;"- No, what's that?"
20:29;20:31;"- They were like the Canadian Avengers."
20:31;20:33;"Oh wait, you got Doctor Strange, John Carter,"
20:33;20:35;"Amazing Spider-Man, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk,"
20:35;20:37;"Marvel Team Up, Solo Adventures,"
20:37;20:39;"Conan the Barbarian, Alpha Flight."
20:39;20:42;"Yeah, Alpha Flight was the Canadian Avengers."
20:42;20:44;"Manhunter 2070."
20:44;20:45;"- Ooh."
20:45;20:48;"- Swamp Thing, Green Lantern, and Strange Sports."
20:48;20:50;"Okay, so Jerry was a full-on comic, too."
20:50;20:51;"- Strange Sports?"
20:51;20:54;"Is it a precursor to Juice Island?"
20:54;20:56;"- Strange Sports, man."
20:56;20:58;"Man, too bad Jerry's not allowed to chime in"
20:58;21:00;"on the Scorsese Marvel thing."
21:00;21:02;"Jerry, what do you think about this?"
21:02;21:03;"- Oh man."
21:03;21:05;"You know what, man, movies are movies."
21:05;21:07;"(laughing)"
21:07;21:08;"- Wow, one of these Canadian Avengers"
21:08;21:10;"turns into a Sasquatch?"
21:10;21:12;"- I think I had one or two Alpha Flight comics,"
21:12;21:14;"and I remember being like, this sucks,"
21:14;21:15;"but it's kind of hilarious that it exists."
21:15;21:18;"I think one of the guys has like a big maple leaf"
21:18;21:20;"on his outfit."
21:20;21:21;"- I think that's the leader of the crew."
21:21;21:23;"- Wait, what are the names of the people in Alpha Flight?"
21:23;21:28;"- Guardian, North Star, Aurora, Sasquatch,"
21:28;21:31;"Shaman, and Snowbird."
21:31;21:34;"Those last two characters are native Canadians."
21:34;21:35;"Very cultural. - Oh, indigenous people."
21:35;21:36;"- Indigenous."
21:36;21:38;"- I wonder if they ever get into that."
21:38;21:41;"- I mean, there's an Inuit demigoddess from Yellowknife."
21:41;21:42;"This is deep."
21:42;21:45;"- All just fighting to protect the interests of Canada."
21:45;21:46;"- I don't know what their mission is, yeah."
21:46;21:48;"- I wonder if a hardcore Canadian comics person"
21:48;21:51;"just like, you know what, Alpha Flight's for Americans."
21:51;21:53;"- We never felt like that depicted"
21:53;21:55;"our true indigenous superhero culture."
21:55;21:58;"- Jake, would you be interested in a piece of art"
21:58;21:59;"that Jerry made?"
21:59;22:00;"- I'd like to see it."
22:00;22:01;"- Oh, here."
22:01;22:02;"- Yeah, there's a bunch of drawings and stuff."
22:02;22:03;"- Hard pass."
22:03;22:06;"- This to me is the strangest thing I've seen."
22:06;22:09;"He has a signed photograph of Larry Bird."
22:09;22:09;"- Oh yeah, I did see that."
22:09;22:10;"- But that's interesting,"
22:10;22:14;"you're basically selling someone else's memorabilia."
22:14;22:15;"That's sports memorabilia,"
22:15;22:17;"it's not Jerry Garcia memorabilia."
22:17;22:18;"- But it's signed to Jerry."
22:18;22:20;"What does it say, Dear Jerry?"
22:20;22:21;"- It says, To Jerry, Best Larry Bird."
22:21;22:23;"(laughing)"
22:23;22:25;"- That's a cool hangout."
22:25;22:26;"- Yeah."
22:26;22:27;"- Bird and Garcia."
22:27;22:29;"'Cause in the Dead, didn't we read about this or something?"
22:29;22:33;"Like the Dead went to see the Celtics practice."
22:33;22:34;"- Because of Bill Walden?"
22:34;22:35;"- Right, okay."
22:35;22:37;"- There's also a pair of Grateful Dead shorts."
22:37;22:39;"Probably the most hilarious thing in the lot"
22:39;22:43;"is just black T-shirt owned and worn by Jerry Garcia."
22:43;22:47;"There's some guitar straps, that's kinda cool."
22:47;22:48;"- That I could see more."
22:48;22:51;"- How about a Hawaiian shirt owned and worn by Jerry Garcia?"
22:51;22:53;"- No man, how much, 800?"
22:53;22:56;"- A plaid shirt worn by Jerry, 300 to 500?"
22:56;22:58;"- There's just something about that that's just sad."
22:58;22:59;"- Drawing of John Wayne?"
22:59;23:01;"- Yikes."
23:01;23:02;"I'm not down with this."
23:02;23:04;"- This one's kinda funky, drawing of an alien."
23:04;23:06;"That's kinda cool and weird."
23:06;23:09;"- Would you wear the Hawaiian shirt around?"
23:09;23:11;"- No, I think you gotta get it framed."
23:11;23:12;"Okay, this is it."
23:12;23:13;"This is the black T-shirt."
23:13;23:15;"- Yeah."
23:15;23:18;"- Black T-shirt owned and worn by Jerry Garcia, circa 1990."
23:18;23:22;"They're thinking that's gonna go for between 1000 and 1500."
23:22;23:25;"- Some guy wearing that around and then being like,"
23:25;23:26;"check out my shirt, man."
23:26;23:30;"His friends are like, yeah, what's up?"
23:30;23:31;"You're wearing a black T-shirt?"
23:31;23:34;"Yeah, do you wanna know the backstory?"
23:34;23:36;"Sure, Jerry Garcia owned this."
23:36;23:39;"- You know what it is, it's Jon Voight's car, right?"
23:39;23:40;"- Totally."
23:40;23:43;"- It's a point of pride taken from the previous owner."
23:43;23:44;"- Jerry owned this shirt."
23:44;23:48;"He wore it in 1990, spring '90 tour."
23:48;23:50;"- Just waiting for-- - Oh, that's cool, man."
23:50;23:51;"- Smell it."
23:51;23:52;"- How much did you spend on that?"
23:52;23:53;"- 1000."
23:53;23:56;"- Cool, man."
23:56;23:58;"- Just waiting for somebody to say like,"
23:58;24:00;"yo, dude, what's the backstory on that black T-shirt"
24:00;24:01;"you're wearing?"
24:01;24:04;"- No one would ever ask that question in a million years."
24:04;24:06;"You have to awkwardly bring it up."
24:06;24:09;"What do you guys think of my shirt?"
24:09;24:10;"- Black shirt. - Is that a black T-shirt?"
24:10;24:11;"- Well, you know what?"
24:11;24:13;"If you're like a real small skinny dude,"
24:13;24:15;"'cause Jerry was on the bigger side in that era."
24:15;24:16;"- Oh, there you go."
24:16;24:18;"- So you could be this small skinny dude,"
24:18;24:21;"you buy this XL black shirts and be like--"
24:21;24:23;"- Double XL baggy."
24:23;24:24;"- Maybe."
24:24;24:25;"Somebody's just like, yo, dude."
24:25;24:26;"- That's a different look for you."
24:26;24:28;"- That's a different look for you, that shirt's huge."
24:28;24:30;"Well, yeah, it's not originally mine."
24:30;24:31;"- Glad you asked."
24:31;24:33;"- It's not originally, no, you could try to be cool about it."
24:33;24:35;"You're just like, oh, well, yeah,"
24:35;24:38;"it's not originally mine, somebody a bit bigger than me"
24:38;24:40;"owned it originally."
24:40;24:41;"What do you mean? - Was it your dad's shirt?"
24:41;24:44;"- It was like, hand me down for somebody in your family?"
24:44;24:46;"No, no, I've actually never met the person."
24:46;24:48;"- But it does have sentimental value."
24:48;24:49;"- Yeah, what do you mean?"
24:49;24:50;"You got it at a thrift store?"
24:50;24:51;"Oh, no, no, no."
24:51;24:53;"I actually paid $1,000 for this."
24:53;24:55;"- Oh, is it like some sort of benefit,"
24:55;24:56;"like some sort of charity auction?"
24:56;24:58;"- It was an auction of sorts."
24:58;25:00;"- Why is this person being so coy about it?"
25:00;25:02;"Why is it, why?"
25:02;25:03;"Why all the questions?"
25:03;25:05;"- I just think 'cause they,"
25:05;25:08;"maybe it's just somebody who's too proud"
25:08;25:09;"to bring it up themselves."
25:09;25:12;"- You just drag it out of them."
25:12;25:13;"- Yeah."
25:13;25:14;"I think there's also something tight"
25:14;25:15;"about just walking into somebody's house"
25:15;25:17;"and just like with no info,"
25:17;25:20;"just a big black t-shirt framed"
25:20;25:24;"in like a gorgeous ornate gold leafed frame."
25:24;25:25;"- Oh, yeah."
25:25;25:27;"Would his DNA have survived on that shirt?"
25:27;25:28;"You know, like--"
25:28;25:29;"- It's very possible."
25:29;25:32;"Wait, are you suggesting we should clone Jerry Garcia?"
25:32;25:35;"- Maybe I'm suggesting a Jurassic Park world-esque premise."
25:35;25:36;"Have we talked about that before?"
25:36;25:37;"- I think we did the,"
25:37;25:39;"we joked about the rock and roll Jurassic Park."
25:39;25:40;"- There we go."
25:40;25:41;"- Where we clone everybody?"
25:41;25:42;"- Yeah."
25:42;25:43;"And it's like a bunch of billionaires after dinner"
25:43;25:45;"and be like, ""Gentlemen, after dinner,"
25:45;25:48;"""Jerry Garcia will be jamming with Jimi Hendrix."""
25:48;25:48;"- Oh, yeah."
25:48;25:51;"- It's like the island of Dr. Moreau or something."
25:51;25:52;"- The shirt is tempting."
25:52;25:55;"- I think a guitar strap could be cool."
25:55;25:55;"- Yeah, the guitar,"
25:55;25:57;"I mean, it depends how much it is."
25:57;25:59;"- Maybe I'm putting a bit on these shorts."
25:59;26:00;"You see these ones?"
26:00;26:01;"A pair of Grateful Dead tour shorts"
26:01;26:04;"'cause it actually says Grateful Dead on it."
26:04;26:04;"- Pretty sick."
26:04;26:05;"- Get those framed."
26:05;26:06;"- You'd have to wear them, dude."
26:06;26:07;"- Play shows and all."

27:10;27:11;"- Shocker, I know."
27:11;27:14;"- Well, we've been so dead centric."
27:14;27:16;"We've never gone too deep."
27:16;27:17;"Dead and twiddle."
27:17;27:18;"- Right."
27:18;27:19;"- This is a dead and twiddle show."
27:19;27:23;"Well, by the way, I wanna tell the TC community."
27:23;27:26;"I've been telling everybody on our TC text thread,"
27:26;27:27;"and I'm sure some people know,"
27:27;27:29;"but I've been on tour quite a bit"
27:29;27:32;"since the last time we were here together in person."
27:32;27:33;"And off the top of my head,"
27:33;27:36;"I can think of at least three Mountain Brews requests"
27:36;27:37;"that we've had."
27:37;27:38;"- Incredible."
27:38;27:43;"- One was at our only show on this whole tour in Germany,"
27:43;27:45;"which was in Cologne, Germany."
27:45;27:47;"And 'cause we always do a request part of the show now,"
27:47;27:49;"and so somebody yelled out Mountain Brews,"
27:49;27:50;"and we're like, oh, whoa,"
27:50;27:53;"'cause we hadn't played that since Red Rocks."
27:53;27:54;"So we're like, let's give it a try."
27:54;27:56;"I think we played about half of it."
27:56;27:57;"And then afterwards, I was curious"
27:57;27:59;"because especially in Europe,"
27:59;28:02;"Europe people traveling country to country"
28:02;28:04;"is not as big a deal as in the US."
28:04;28:06;"And then of course,"
28:06;28:08;"when Vampire Weekend plays a show in Europe,"
28:08;28:11;"it's mostly people from the country,"
28:11;28:14;"but it's totally classic to be rolling out of the show"
28:14;28:17;"in Brussels, and there's a few Belgian people,"
28:17;28:20;"and then they're just like, yo, dude, huge fan."
28:20;28:22;"And just like, where are you from, man?"
28:22;28:24;"And just like, oh, yeah, I'm from Jersey,"
28:24;28:27;"I'm studying here, or I got a job, whatever."
28:27;28:29;"That happens a lot."
28:29;28:30;"So you never know."
28:30;28:31;"So I was feeling like, oh, Mountain Brews cover,"
28:31;28:34;"I wonder if these people are maybe like,"
28:34;28:35;"from the US or something."
28:35;28:36;"So after we played it, I was like,"
28:36;28:38;"where are you guys from, by the way?"
28:38;28:40;"And they're just like, Frankfurt."
28:40;28:41;"(laughing)"
28:41;28:42;"- That's epic."
28:42;28:43;"- They jumped on the train,"
28:43;28:44;"rolled out to Cologne for the show"
28:44;28:45;"and requested Mountain Brews."
28:45;28:46;"- Epic."
28:46;28:48;"- And then we got a couple at these acoustic shows we did."
28:48;28:50;"- Well, I saw clips on Instagram"
28:50;28:53;"of your Portland performance of Mountain Brews."
28:53;28:53;"- Yeah."
28:53;28:55;"- Sounded great, it was real reckoning."
28:55;28:56;"- Oh, right, 'cause it was acoustic."
28:56;28:57;"- Acoustic and seated."
28:57;28:59;"- Oh, yeah, Brian ripped a great solo,"
28:59;29:00;"a great acoustic solo."
29:00;29:03;"So anyway, Mountain Brews is still going strong."
29:03;29:05;"Can't wait for that Mountain Run next year."
29:05;29:06;"- Oh, hell yeah, dude."
29:06;29:08;"- The Mountain Run with Twiddle."
29:08;29:12;"All right, so Jake, who or what is Goose"
29:12;29:13;"and why are we about to talk"
29:13;29:16;"to legendary rock journalist Stephen Hyden"
29:16;29:18;"about it/them?"
29:18;29:22;"- Goose is a jam band from my home state."
29:22;29:24;"They're from Norwalk, Connecticut."
29:24;29:26;"- The much maligned Connecticut."
29:26;29:29;"- Yeah, obviously CT has a terrible track record musically."
29:29;29:30;"- Oh, wait, by the way, real quick."
29:30;29:31;"- So I'm glad that Goose--"
29:31;29:32;"- I can tell you, real quick sidebar."
29:32;29:33;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
29:33;29:36;"- I heard a story from our boy, Matt,"
29:36;29:38;"who works at our management company."
29:38;29:40;"He's part of our management team."
29:40;29:43;"And you know, he checks into TC every now and then."
29:43;29:45;"And he was like, he's like, ""I gotta tell you, man,"
29:45;29:46;"""I had a really weird experience."
29:46;29:48;"""I was driving in the car, me and my wife,"
29:48;29:50;"""and I throw it on."
29:50;29:53;"""I just heard Jake going off on CT."
29:53;29:54;"""I'm dumbfounded, man."""
29:54;29:55;"- What the hell, man?"
29:55;29:57;"- And you're sitting there like half agreeing with him."
29:57;29:58;"You occasionally like say,"
29:58;30:02;"""Well, but I was just like, what is going on, man?"""
30:02;30:03;"And then of course he realized"
30:03;30:04;"that you were talking about Connecticut,"
30:04;30:06;"but he thought you were talking about Chris Tomlin."
30:06;30:07;"- What was I saying?"
30:07;30:11;"Just like CT has an incredible, just a thin track record."
30:11;30:12;"- I think, yeah, imagine you're just like,"
30:12;30:15;"like CT, musically not up to snuff."
30:15;30:17;"- Copying the article."
30:17;30:18;"- Yeah, just like, yeah."
30:18;30:21;"Yeah, what would you have said that wouldn't have been clear"
30:21;30:23;"but I guess just like, just like,"
30:23;30:25;"""Look, man, not a fan of CT."
30:25;30:27;"""I got no loyalty to CT."""
30:27;30:31;"- Sorry if that's controversial, but I'm not down with CT."
30:31;30:31;"And I'm just like, well, you know."
30:31;30:33;"- CT is weak."
30:33;30:34;"- Yeah."
30:34;30:38;"So maybe it was more like 10 seconds of just like,"
30:38;30:39;"""Damn."""
30:39;30:39;"- You're just like, ""What is going on?"""
30:39;30:42;"- Why is it, what did CT do to Jake?"
30:42;30:45;"Anyway, CT is the initials of Connecticut,"
30:45;30:46;"not Chris Tomlin."
30:46;30:48;"- Oh my God."
30:48;30:49;"- So yeah, you've-- - That rules."
30:49;30:51;"- So you've always gone off about how Connecticut--"
30:51;30:53;"- Does not pull its weight."
30:53;30:54;"- Does not pull its weight in the tri-state area,"
30:54;30:55;"which I agree with."
30:55;30:58;"- Yeah, I mean, come on, Jersey, New York."
30:58;31:00;"- Also on this last run,"
31:00;31:03;"I realized I'm a big fan of Philly and Pennsylvania."
31:03;31:03;"- That's tight."
31:03;31:04;"- But anyway."
31:04;31:07;"- There is a jam band out of Norwalk, Connecticut"
31:07;31:08;"called Goose."
31:08;31:10;"And I didn't, you know,"
31:10;31:13;"I don't follow the jam band scene closely at all."
31:13;31:16;"Stephen Hyden, sort of a friend on Twitter hit me up."
31:16;31:17;"He's like, ""Are you following Goose?"
31:17;31:20;"""Because they are like the hot story"
31:20;31:23;"""in the jam band community in 2019."
31:23;31:24;"""And they're from CT."""
31:24;31:27;"And so I immediately listened to their new single,"
31:27;31:28;"""Butter Rum."""
31:28;31:32;"- And what was your take?"
31:32;31:34;"- It has kind of Jamflow Man vibes"
31:34;31:37;"in that it's like pretty funny,"
31:37;31:40;"unclear on the like intentionality behind the humor."
31:40;31:41;"It's like catchy."
31:41;31:43;"- Well, I think all jam,"
31:43;31:46;"part of being a jam band is having a sense of humor."
31:46;31:48;"I think all the classics do."
31:48;31:48;"- Yeah."
31:48;31:51;"- So I always feel like if you're unclear about"
31:51;31:53;"if a jam band is being a little funny with something,"
31:53;31:54;"I usually think they are."
31:54;31:55;"- Yeah."
31:55;31:56;"- I haven't heard of Goose."
31:56;31:57;"- No, no, yeah, I mean, I hear that."
31:57;31:58;"- And you love the name."
31:58;32:00;"- Goose is an incredible band name."
32:00;32:01;"- That is a sick name."
32:01;32:02;"- Goose is sick."
32:02;32:05;"- Are you aware that there's another Goose band"
32:05;32:06;"from Belgium?"
32:06;32:07;"- Oh, uh-oh."
32:07;32:09;"- Electronic rock band."
32:09;32:10;"It sounds like they're a bit of like"
32:10;32:13;"a European imagination, dragons."
32:13;32:14;"- Goose versus Goose."
32:14;32:15;"- Anyway, I think I just,"
32:15;32:18;"I think I just asked Stephen if he wanted to call in and--"
32:18;32:19;"- Well, I'm super curious."
32:19;32:21;"- And just kind of set the record straight about Goose"
32:21;32:22;"and hype it up a little bit."
32:22;32:25;"- On paper, not having heard the music,"
32:25;32:27;"a jam band from Connecticut called Goose"
32:27;32:29;"is 10 out of 10 for me already."
32:29;32:31;"But let's see what Haydn has to say."
32:31;32:33;"I'm also just curious about,"
32:33;32:34;"'cause we talked about a little bit with Twiddle,"
32:34;32:37;"but the modern jam band scene."
32:37;32:37;"- Right."
32:37;32:38;"- I'm so curious about it."
32:38;32:39;"- I don't follow this at all,"
32:39;32:42;"so I think Stephen can like clue us in on like the vibes."
32:42;32:43;"- All right, cool."
32:43;32:46;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
32:46;32:49;"(phone ringing)"
32:49;32:51;"- Hey, Stephen, are you there?"
32:51;32:52;"- Yeah, I'm here."
32:52;32:53;"- Hey, Stephen."
32:53;32:55;"- Hey, Stephen, welcome back to Time Crisis."
32:55;32:57;"- Ah, thanks for having me, I'm excited."
32:57;32:59;"- So let's just get right into it, man."
32:59;33:00;"You hit Jake up on Twitter"
33:00;33:02;"'cause you thought he'd be interested to know"
33:02;33:03;"that there's a poppin' jam band"
33:03;33:05;"out of Connecticut called Goose."
33:05;33:07;"When did they get on your radar?"
33:07;33:08;"- I first heard about them,"
33:08;33:11;"it was probably late summer, early fall."
33:11;33:12;"It just seemed like overnight,"
33:12;33:15;"like one day I'd never heard of them,"
33:15;33:16;"and then the next day,"
33:16;33:19;"jam band Twitter was like a flutter with Goose talk."
33:19;33:21;"And it's really been like that,"
33:21;33:23;"like for the last three or four months."
33:23;33:26;"They started out almost like a meme,"
33:26;33:29;"where it wasn't clear whether people actually liked this band"
33:29;33:32;"or if they were making fun of this band,"
33:32;33:34;"but I think it's pretty clear at this point"
33:34;33:36;"that there's genuine excitement."
33:36;33:38;"They have a show on Ducks TV,"
33:38;33:40;"they streamed one of their shows last month."
33:40;33:45;"They're gonna be playing the Cancun, Mexico,"
33:45;33:47;"Grateful Dead show that they do in January."
33:47;33:50;"- They're opening for Dead & Co. down in Mexico,"
33:50;33:51;"down Mexico way?"
33:51;33:54;"- I think what happens is the Dead does a show,"
33:54;33:56;"and then there's a late night show after,"
33:56;33:58;"like an after party type thing."
33:58;33:59;"And I think Goose is doing that."
33:59;34:01;"- So that's a pretty major cosign."
34:01;34:02;"- Absolutely, absolutely."
34:02;34:04;"And it will be interesting to see,"
34:04;34:06;"I'm sure that they're gonna be getting"
34:06;34:08;"a big bump from that in 2020s."
34:08;34:10;"- So have you gotten deep on the music?"
34:10;34:11;"- I have."
34:11;34:12;"This band, I think one of the reasons"
34:12;34:15;"that they've become so popular relatively quickly"
34:15;34:18;"is that they've marketed themselves really well."
34:18;34:21;"You can go on NUGS.net and you can stream every show"
34:21;34:23;"that they've played this year."
34:23;34:25;"It's good quality sound."
34:25;34:27;"And you can go on YouTube and you can stream"
34:27;34:30;"three or four complete concerts that are pro shot"
34:30;34:31;"and look really good."
34:31;34:34;"And then I actually went on Bandcamp"
34:34;34:36;"and downloaded some stuff,"
34:36;34:39;"'cause you can pay seven bucks and download a show."
34:39;34:43;"I think I'm a genuine Goose backer at this point."
34:43;34:46;"- Is there a cool name for Goose fans?"
34:46;34:47;"- You know, I knew you'd be asking this,"
34:47;34:49;"and this was something I researched,"
34:49;34:51;"'cause I didn't know this ahead of time."
34:51;34:55;"Apparently, The Flock is the name for Goose fans."
34:55;34:56;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on."
34:56;34:59;"I thought The Flock was the pigeons playing ping pong fans."
34:59;35:00;"Let me get a number crunch."
35:00;35:03;"What do you call pigeons playing ping pong fans?"
35:03;35:05;"- Yeah, The Flock is the official group name"
35:05;35:07;"for pigeons playing ping pong."
35:07;35:09;"Fans, friends, and foes alike."
35:09;35:10;"- We have two bands called Goose."
35:10;35:13;"We have two fan bases called The Flock."
35:13;35:14;"(laughing)"
35:14;35:15;"We got some issues."
35:15;35:16;"- I mean, it's possible,"
35:16;35:19;"'cause Goose really hasn't been around that long."
35:19;35:21;"I think they've only been with this lineup"
35:21;35:23;"for a couple of years."
35:23;35:26;"They're sort of in the process of establishing themselves."
35:26;35:28;"- Are they still based out of Connecticut?"
35:28;35:29;"- I think so."
35:29;35:30;"I haven't heard otherwise."
35:30;35:31;"It's Norwalk, by the way."
35:31;35:34;"Is that by where you grew up, Jake?"
35:34;35:36;"- Yeah, I used to run cross-country races in Norwalk."
35:36;35:37;"- Oh, yeah?"
35:37;35:38;"- I'm very familiar."
35:38;35:41;"- Because with Goose and John Mayer both being from CT,"
35:41;35:44;"I feel like this is the jam band."
35:44;35:45;"They've kind of cornered the market"
35:45;35:48;"on big jam bands constituencies at this point."
35:48;35:50;"- Yeah, maybe Connecticut finally is asserting"
35:50;35:52;"a type of musical identity."
35:52;35:53;"- I guess I'll take it."
35:53;35:56;"This is, I'm not happy about it, but I will take it."
35:56;35:58;"(laughing)"
35:58;35:59;"- I don't know."
35:59;36:00;"You should lean into it."
36:00;36:01;"- If you had to describe Goose's music"
36:01;36:04;"in terms of the jam bands that we on TC"
36:04;36:05;"are more familiar with,"
36:05;36:09;"are they leaning dead, leaning fish, leading twiddle?"
36:09;36:12;"- I would say they're definitely in the fish mold."
36:12;36:15;"And when you listen to interviews with the band members,"
36:15;36:19;"it sounds like fish is one of their main reference points."
36:19;36:21;"Like the guitar player named Rick,"
36:21;36:23;"he's talked about how when he was in high school,"
36:23;36:24;"he was a fish fan."
36:24;36:28;"And then I think in 2009, he was a senior in high school,"
36:28;36:31;"and that's when fish came back from their hiatus."
36:31;36:34;"So that was a pretty formative experience for him."
36:34;36:37;"And then The Breakers does, and a decade later,"
36:37;36:40;"he's also talked about that being a big deal for him."
36:40;36:44;"So it's funny because there's not actually a lot of bands"
36:44;36:47;"in that community that sound like fish."
36:47;36:49;"You would think that fish would be a main"
36:49;36:50;"sort of reference point,"
36:50;36:52;"but I actually think it's kind of a hard thing"
36:52;36:54;"to replicate what they do."
36:54;36:56;"So I kind of feel like that's part of the excitement"
36:56;36:59;"with this band is they are reminiscent"
36:59;37:02;"of an early '90s fish, and they're young,"
37:02;37:04;"and it's a young enough becoming band"
37:04;37:06;"that people can get excited about."
37:06;37:06;"- Right."
37:06;37:08;"Well, Steve, in breaking news,"
37:08;37:12;"Nick just handed me a article, I guess it was an interview,"
37:12;37:15;"and it says, ""Mitterot, Tonda, and Atkin"
37:15;37:17;"met at Berkeley School of Music in Boston."""
37:17;37:18;"- No shocker there."
37:18;37:20;"- ""The biggest common musical influence"
37:20;37:22;"between the two at the time was jazz rock,"
37:22;37:24;"like John Schofield and Madesky Martin Wood."
37:24;37:26;"He also lists a popular indie rock band as an inspiration."
37:26;37:29;"Vampire Weekend is one band that we are both very fond of."""
37:29;37:32;"(explosion)"
37:32;37:33;"Okay, I'm sold."
37:33;37:34;"(laughing)"
37:34;37:34;"I'm (beep) with Goose."
37:34;37:35;"Still haven't heard the music,"
37:35;37:37;"but I already love the idea of Goose"
37:37;37:39;"being from CT."
37:39;37:41;"- Well, I feel like their self-described genre"
37:41;37:42;"is indie groove."
37:42;37:43;"- Not jam."
37:43;37:44;"- Not jam."
37:44;37:46;"I remember seeing that somewhere on their website"
37:46;37:49;"or something, which was a term that was new to me."
37:49;37:51;"- Well, they talked about how, you know,"
37:51;37:54;"unlike a lot of jam bands who are sort of"
37:54;37:56;"going back to the '60s and '70s,"
37:56;37:57;"that, you know, these are guys in their 20s"
37:57;37:59;"who grew up listening to music"
37:59;38:02;"from like the 2000s and 2010s."
38:02;38:05;"So it wouldn't surprise me that Vampire Weekend,"
38:05;38:07;"for instance, would be big on their radar."
38:07;38:09;"I know that Rick, the main guy,"
38:09;38:13;"has talked about Bon Iver being a big deal for him."
38:13;38:16;"And they've even like dabbled in like autotune"
38:16;38:17;"on some of their songs,"
38:17;38:19;"which is like a controversial thing."
38:19;38:20;"- I noticed that."
38:20;38:22;"- Yeah, it was kind of weird,"
38:22;38:24;"'cause they did this streaming show on NUGSTV,"
38:24;38:29;"which was like a big deal in jam band Twitter circles."
38:29;38:34;"And he did a lot of like autotune in that performance,"
38:34;38:35;"and it was kind of weird."
38:35;38:37;"- Was it like Bon Iver-esque autotune?"
38:37;38:41;"Like stacked, weird kind of experimental autotune?"
38:41;38:42;"- It was kind of a weird comparison."
38:42;38:46;"It kind of reminded me of like the Cher autotune,"
38:46;38:48;"'cause they have like kind of an EDM dance element"
38:48;38:49;"to what they do."
38:49;38:50;"And like there's a song that they do,"
38:50;38:52;"I think it's called ""All I Need,"""
38:52;38:54;"which is like a very upbeat,"
38:54;38:56;"almost kind of dancey sounding rock song,"
38:56;38:58;"and that's what they were doing it on."
38:58;39:01;"So that's definitely more of like a contemporary thing"
39:01;39:03;"that they're bringing into jam band music."
39:03;39:05;"- I mean, that is a whole world of jam stuff"
39:05;39:07;"that I'm like vaguely familiar with,"
39:07;39:10;"the kind of like Soundtribe Sector 9,"
39:10;39:12;"and it basically is dance music,"
39:12;39:14;"but that kind of lives more,"
39:14;39:16;"you know, it's at the same festivals"
39:16;39:17;"as more traditional jam bands."
39:17;39:19;"Like obviously there's significant crossover"
39:19;39:20;"in terms of fan base,"
39:20;39:25;"with like dubstep and certain forms of EDM and jam."
39:25;39:28;"It makes sense that somebody would truly marry it."
39:28;39:29;"How's Goose's merch?"
39:29;39:32;"(laughing)"
39:32;39:33;"- You know, this is a question"
39:33;39:36;"I should have anticipated and investigated,"
39:36;39:38;"knowing what I was going on TC."
39:38;39:39;"No, it's funny because like,"
39:39;39:42;"they really have kind of exploded,"
39:42;39:44;"I think quicker than they expected this year."
39:44;39:46;"And I heard a podcast interview,"
39:46;39:47;"like where they were talking about"
39:47;39:50;"how they're playing catch up in a lot of ways"
39:50;39:52;"with the size of their audience,"
39:52;39:54;"because I don't know like how much merch"
39:54;39:56;"they really have at this point."
39:56;39:57;"Like one of the guys said that like,"
39:57;40:00;"we're sort of in the process of assembling a crew right now,"
40:00;40:03;"because you know, like they started selling out shows"
40:03;40:06;"this fall, like at a much faster rate than they were before."
40:06;40:08;"It kind of seems like 2019"
40:08;40:10;"was like the beginning of their ascendance,"
40:10;40:14;"and then like 2020 will be like their maybe blowout year."
40:14;40:17;"And then we'll know what kind of merch they have"
40:17;40:18;"at that point."
40:18;40:22;"- Okay, well I'm 100% still not having heard a note."
40:22;40:24;"I'm sold enough that 100% 2020,"
40:24;40:25;"I'm gonna go to a Goose show."
40:25;40:27;"- Well dude, they're playing Troubadour"
40:27;40:28;"February 7th and 8th."
40:28;40:29;"- Oh really?"
40:29;40:30;"- We're going both nights."
40:30;40:31;"- Okay, hell yeah."
40:31;40:32;"Steven, come out."
40:32;40:33;"- I will absolutely come out."
40:33;40:35;"- It's a Friday and a Saturday."
40:35;40:37;"Goose weekend, dude."
40:37;40:41;"- I'm going out to New York to see fish at MSG"
40:41;40:43;"for like the New Year's Eve run."
40:43;40:45;"Yeah, first time I've ever done that."
40:45;40:47;"I've only been to MSG once, I've never seen fish there,"
40:47;40:49;"so I'm really excited for that."
40:49;40:51;"- That's amazing, I went to my first fish show last week."
40:51;40:53;"- I heard about that, that was another discussion"
40:53;40:57;"on Jim Van Twitter, was you going to see fish."
40:57;40:59;"'Cause I think you talked about it on your social media."
40:59;41:02;"- Oh yeah, I put an Instagram story."
41:02;41:03;"Yeah, I thought it was an amazing vibe."
41:03;41:05;"Also, somebody told me that there's somebody"
41:05;41:08;"who hosts almost like a sports-like play-by-play"
41:08;41:11;"color commentary of fish shows, like in real time."
41:11;41:13;"They're just like, ""Oh, it sounds like Trey"
41:13;41:16;"""is starting to tease Tweezer."
41:16;41:18;"""Is he gonna bring the riff back?"
41:18;41:21;"""Hold on, hold on, Fishman is going double time."""
41:21;41:22;"Does that exist?"
41:22;41:24;"Somebody told me there was something like that."
41:24;41:24;"- I don't think not."
41:24;41:26;"- I would listen to that before the show."
41:26;41:28;"That sounds so much more entertaining."
41:28;41:30;"- Somebody told me there's something like that existed"
41:30;41:31;"and that's how they knew I was at the show,"
41:31;41:32;"'cause the guys were like,"
41:32;41:33;"""Ezra Kanick's in the building."""
41:33;41:35;"- I don't think that normally exists."
41:35;41:37;"That might've been true for that show."
41:37;41:40;"I know that there was a lot of controversy about that show."
41:40;41:44;"A lot of people were sort of mad that they played one"
41:44;41:46;"that it was a radio-only show,"
41:46;41:49;"'cause that show wasn't on the live fish app."
41:49;41:51;"- Oh, blacked out."
41:51;41:53;"- You could only hear it on the Sirius app,"
41:53;41:55;"so a lot of people were mad about that."
41:55;41:58;"I heard people complaining about the on-air hosts"
41:58;42:00;"not being that good, which I'm not saying that myself."
42:00;42:02;"I have not heard it yet."
42:02;42:04;"I was gone that night."
42:04;42:05;"I don't know."
42:05;42:07;"People are pretty critical of these sorts of things,"
42:07;42:11;"and when things don't proceed as they normally do"
42:11;42:13;"or as people feel that they're supposed to,"
42:13;42:15;"the fan base gets pretty upset."
42:15;42:19;"So something even small about not putting a show"
42:19;42:22;"on the fish app is a pretty big deal"
42:22;42:24;"among the jam band community when that happens."
42:24;42:27;"- That's true with any kind of fan base."
42:28;42:30;"- I think within any fan base, you have your quiet fans,"
42:30;42:34;"and then you have your just super positive,"
42:34;42:36;"excited about everything coming down the pipeline,"
42:36;42:39;"understanding when things are different or something,"
42:39;42:41;"and then every fan base has that."
42:41;42:43;"Just worse than the haters fans."
42:43;42:47;"Everything is just like, wow, these guys (beep) suck."
42:47;42:49;"Waiting for those moments to be like,"
42:49;42:51;"well, that's official, 30-plus years in,"
42:51;42:53;"and Fish is finally sold out, man."
42:53;42:55;"I'm joining the flock."

44:09;44:13;"- Steven, do you have a podcast that's coming out soon?"
44:13;44:14;"- Yes. - Isn't it,"
44:14;44:15;"like kind of related to this?"
44:15;44:19;"- Yes, I do, and thank you for asking, Jake."
44:19;44:21;"It's coming out next month."
44:21;44:23;"It's called ""36 From the Vault."""
44:23;44:25;"It's me and my friend, Rob Mitchum."
44:25;44:28;"We're gonna be reviewing every installment"
44:28;44:30;"of the ""Dicks Pick"" series"
44:30;44:33;"with like digressions along the way."
44:33;44:36;"We'll probably do like official dead live albums."
44:36;44:38;"It might do some Dave's Picks."
44:38;44:41;"Might do some John Mayer live records in there too."
44:41;44:45;"You know, as you know, the whole kid caboodle."
44:45;44:47;"I feel like, you know, this is something that"
44:47;44:50;"if the show takes off, we can find a way to do it forever."
44:50;44:51;"You know, 'cause there's so many different"
44:51;44:52;"great full dead live stuff."
44:52;44:54;"- Are you gonna be talking over the show?"
44:54;44:58;"- No, I mean, it's always tricky with like rights."
44:58;44:59;"- Rights issues, yeah, sure. - Music."
44:59;45:00;"- Oh, I see, I see."
45:00;45:02;"- So we probably won't actually be playing"
45:02;45:05;"any of the actual music in there."
45:05;45:08;"We have, but we have a great score"
45:08;45:10;"that's being written by Amar,"
45:10;45:12;"who you've talked about on your show,"
45:12;45:15;"who like does those great jam breakdown videos."
45:15;45:16;"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh."
45:16;45:18;"- Well, yeah, and I was thinking about him"
45:18;45:19;"as you're discussing the kind of post show,"
45:19;45:22;"'cause he contextualizes everything."
45:22;45:24;"- Yeah, he's doing the score for the show,"
45:24;45:27;"so that's gonna be playing under us as we're talking."
45:27;45:29;"One of the fun things about this podcast"
45:29;45:31;"is that we're gonna be talking about the concerts,"
45:31;45:34;"but it's also just a great excuse to talk about"
45:34;45:36;"the time period around each show."
45:36;45:39;"Like Dix Picks One takes place,"
45:39;45:42;"I think it's December 19th, 1973."
45:42;45:44;"So we talk about what was the biggest song"
45:44;45:47;"in America at that time, what was the biggest album?"
45:47;45:50;"The Exorcist came out the week after that show."
45:50;45:52;"So we had a conversation about whether the dead"
45:52;45:54;"didn't play any New Year's Eve shows that year,"
45:54;45:56;"because Jerry was excited to see The Exorcist."
45:56;45:58;"- Well, Jerry's a big fan of horror,"
45:58;46:00;"including in the comics realm."
46:00;46:02;"As we were just talking about this auction"
46:02;46:04;"of all his comics, they're definitely leaning"
46:04;46:06;"a lot of tales from the crypt."
46:06;46:09;"- Right, and there's that bit in the documentary,"
46:09;46:12;"Long Strange Trip, where the last interview he did"
46:12;46:14;"was about Abbott Costello meets Frankenstein,"
46:14;46:15;"I think it was."
46:15;46:16;"- Right."
46:16;46:18;"- So he was like a big horror movie fan."
46:18;46:20;"So it's a great excuse to talk about the dead,"
46:20;46:22;"but it's also just like a fun way to talk about"
46:22;46:26;"pop culture history, like around the time of each show."
46:26;46:28;"And like talking about the music venues"
46:28;46:31;"that they played in, 'cause there's like some weird"
46:31;46:33;"old theaters and convention centers"
46:33;46:36;"that don't exist anymore that the Grateful Dead played in,"
46:36;46:38;"like in the '60s and '70s."
46:38;46:39;"- Oh, looking forward to that."
46:39;46:40;"It sounds exciting. - Yeah."
46:40;46:41;"- We banked a couple of ups."
46:41;46:42;"- Oh, cool."
46:42;46:44;"- By the way, am I a friend of the podcast now?"
46:44;46:44;"This is my second time on this show."
46:44;46:47;"- Yeah, I think now you're a friend of the pod, for sure."
46:47;46:49;"- Which means I've been demoted, right?"
46:49;46:51;"'Cause I was executive level before now."
46:51;46:54;"Isn't that how it goes if you're like a first time guest?"
46:54;46:56;"- There's a type of demotion."
46:56;46:58;"Familiarity breeds contempt."
46:58;47:00;"(laughing)"
47:00;47:05;"So, you know, every, the closer to the crew,"
47:05;47:07;"that's the kind of irony of life."
47:07;47:09;"A lot of people hold some of their worst vitriol"
47:09;47:10;"for their loved ones."
47:10;47:11;"- I'm still honored."
47:11;47:12;"I'm still honored to be a friend of the pod."
47:12;47:14;"- Seinfeld, we gotta like, are you taking notes?"
47:14;47:16;"We need a real friend of the pod."
47:16;47:17;"- That's our next one."
47:17;47:18;"- Okay, tight."
47:18;47:20;"Well, what song should we play?"
47:20;47:22;"I'm sure all the TC heads are on the edge"
47:22;47:23;"of their seat right now."
47:23;47:24;"I wanna hear this band."
47:24;47:26;"Butterum is very Jamflow, man."
47:26;47:29;"- Well, it's also sort of like a non-satirical"
47:29;47:30;"Bananas Abloh."
47:30;47:31;"- Exactly."
47:31;47:32;"- You know, like the Wayne song."
47:32;47:35;"You know, my feeling on jam bands is that like,"
47:35;47:39;"I think a good jam band should be like 15% cheesy,"
47:39;47:42;"you know, because like a great jam band,"
47:42;47:45;"they're simultaneously an art band and a party band."
47:45;47:48;"You know, like the Dead plays Dark Star for 20 minutes"
47:48;47:50;"and then they play Good Lovin' right after that."
47:50;47:54;"You know, or Fish plays, you know, You Enjoy Myself"
47:54;47:56;"and then they play Suzy Greenberg after that."
47:56;47:59;"You know, you've got like the esoteric stuff"
47:59;48:01;"and like sort of like the beer hoisting,"
48:01;48:03;"dumb party anthem type stuff."
48:03;48:07;"So like with Goose, you know, they definitely have like,"
48:07;48:09;"you know, the buttered rum part, but you know,"
48:09;48:11;"they can also go off for 20 minutes into outer space"
48:11;48:14;"and do kind of cool jammy things."
48:14;48:19;"So I will say the show I'd recommend is 10, 18, 19."
48:19;48:21;"- So recent."
48:21;48:24;"- I think it's a really good show"
48:24;48:27;"and it's the show that got me into it."
48:27;48:29;"And they do a cover of the way it is,"
48:29;48:30;"the Bruce Hornsby song."
48:30;48:31;"- Oh, the song, okay."
48:31;48:32;"- Which is like, they actually do a really,"
48:32;48:34;"like a 15 minute version of that song."
48:34;48:35;"And I think they do like,"
48:35;48:37;"I think it's a really good version."
48:37;48:38;"I think they do a great cover of that."
48:38;48:42;"They do a cover of Inside Out, the song by Spoon."
48:42;48:44;"- One tight thing about jam bands is like,"
48:44;48:46;"you can get so deep in the conversation"
48:46;48:48;"without ever playing the music."
48:48;48:52;"Like, if you're telling us about like a new indie rock band"
48:52;48:55;"or just like a new singer songwriter kind of guy,"
48:55;48:57;"like the next Iron and Wine or something,"
48:57;48:59;"if you go more than like three minutes"
48:59;49:02;"without playing the music, it's like insane."
49:02;49:04;"But with jam bands, you could actually be like,"
49:04;49:07;"they're Goose, they're out of Norwalk, Connecticut."
49:07;49:10;"101819's a great show and they do a 15 minute,"
49:10;49:12;"that's just the way it is by Bruce Hornsby."
49:12;49:14;"And it's, I'm like, tell me more, man."
49:14;49:15;"Like, no, we're not gonna listen to it yet."
49:15;49:16;"Like, oh, I love that."
49:16;49:19;"15 minute, 15 minute Hornsby, tight."
49:19;49:20;"(laughing)"
49:20;49:21;"- Maybe you should just like, you know,"
49:21;49:23;"if you don't wanna listen to the show,"
49:23;49:26;"just like take in my description of it and enjoy that."
49:26;49:28;"You know, like maybe you should just stop there"
49:28;49:30;"if you like what I'm describing."
49:30;49:32;"- I just could like terrorize some jam band message boards"
49:32;49:36;"and be like, I'm a text-based jam enthusiast."
49:36;49:38;"I don't listen to the music."
49:38;49:39;"Like, yes, we exist."
49:39;49:41;"- Never heard a note, never will."
49:41;49:44;"- Okay, Steve, is there one Goose song though to play?"
49:44;49:46;"Obviously we're all gonna check out 101819."
49:46;49:48;"Is there, not besides Butterum."
49:48;49:52;"What's one that's like just your favorite?"
49:52;49:54;"- Why don't you play Time to Flee?"
49:54;49:55;"- Okay, tight."
49:55;49:58;"All right, everybody, Steve and Hyden,"
49:58;49:59;"thanks again for calling in"
49:59;50:01;"and here's Goose with Time to Flee."
50:01;50:05;"- Time Crisis with Ezra K. Nagle."

51:05;51:07;"- You know what I just thought of?"
51:07;51:09;"Because on the one hand,"
51:09;51:10;"becoming more and more familiar"
51:10;51:12;"with the jam community every day,"
51:12;51:14;"but I don't know the ins and outs."
51:14;51:17;"I hope there's no like twiddle goose beef."
51:17;51:18;"That's gonna be messed up 'cause--"
51:18;51:20;"- Right, we're just gonna get back to the twiddle camp"
51:20;51:23;"that we're going to the goose show at the Troubadour."
51:23;51:24;"- Yeah. - Both nights."
51:24;51:25;"- But-- - What would be the beef?"
51:25;51:27;"Just sort of like--"
51:27;51:27;"- You know, just sometimes--"
51:27;51:29;"- You know, in competitive bands."
51:29;51:30;"- Look, I remember when Vampire Weekend came out,"
51:30;51:32;"there'd be some other indie bands dropping their album."
51:32;51:35;"You know, they gotta get a little,"
51:35;51:37;"talking a little spicy in the interview, man."
51:37;51:39;"We live in a competitive society, man."
51:39;51:40;"- Dog eat dog."
51:40;51:41;"- It's dog eat dog."
51:41;51:44;"There's no social safety net in America, man."
51:44;51:47;"So, you know, people are fighting for that slot."
51:47;51:49;"Another person's success is often perceived"
51:49;51:51;"to be a lack of opportunity for you."
51:51;51:52;"- But you know what, man?"
51:52;51:54;"That's what makes great art, Ezra."
51:54;51:56;"It's that cutthroat competitive spirit."
51:56;51:59;"It's that brutal sense of competition and--"
51:59;52:00;"- Well, partially."
52:00;52:01;"I mean, all joking aside."
52:01;52:03;"But I wonder if the--"
52:03;52:04;"(laughing)"
52:04;52:05;"- Well, I'm just saying, I guess the Twiddle--"
52:05;52:07;"- 'Cause the jam band community's a little more embracing."
52:07;52:08;"- Twiddle's been around for a while."
52:08;52:09;"And I will say one thing,"
52:09;52:14;"because actually, Mahali texted me a couple months ago,"
52:14;52:16;"or a few weeks, I can't even remember anymore."
52:16;52:17;"But Mahali from Twiddle hit me up"
52:17;52:19;"because he was letting me know"
52:19;52:21;"that his buddy's in a jam band."
52:21;52:23;"I'm sure everybody would,"
52:23;52:25;"just like when people call Vampire Weekend an indie band,"
52:25;52:27;"I'm sure a lot of these bands would be like,"
52:27;52:30;"okay, we're jam, but we're also this."
52:30;52:32;"But he put me onto this band called Aquius,"
52:32;52:35;"and he sent me an 11-minute sunflower"
52:35;52:38;"that they busted out at Higher Ground in Burlington."
52:38;52:39;"- Sick."
52:39;52:40;"- It was tight."
52:40;52:41;"I mean, they're incredible musicians."
52:41;52:43;"I was like, oh, I don't know anything about these guys."
52:43;52:45;"And Mahali was like, yo, they're like an up-and-coming jam"
52:45;52:46;"band, like I really love them."
52:46;52:47;"And he's like, yo, check 'em out."
52:47;52:49;"He was so, I mean, I could already tell"
52:49;52:51;"that he has a generosity of spirit,"
52:51;52:53;"but he was just all like, he was like,"
52:53;52:55;"oh yeah, you should totally check these dudes out."
52:55;52:57;"Which is, again, is what you want from the jam community."
52:57;52:58;"- Right."
52:58;52:59;"- Sometimes this stuff happens"
52:59;53:02;"beyond the artist relationship."
53:02;53:05;"It can be the press, it can be the fans,"
53:05;53:06;"it can be the people on message boards"
53:06;53:08;"can pit artists against each other."
53:08;53:11;"- They're drumming up that goose twiddle animosity."
53:11;53:13;"Did you see that Aquius does a sunflower cover?"
53:13;53:14;"- Seinfeld!"
53:14;53:16;"- Wow."
53:16;53:17;"- Is that what you just said?"
53:17;53:18;"- Get your head out of your ass, buddy."
53:18;53:21;"- I was reading about it while you were talking about it."
53:21;53:23;"I apologize, is that what you just said?"
53:23;53:26;"- We hired you because we believed you could multitask."
53:26;53:27;"- I was trying to crunch the numbers."
53:27;53:29;"- I'll admit that your job is demanding."
53:29;53:31;"You need to simultaneously listen to Jake and I's"
53:31;53:33;"every word as you're crunching the numbers."
53:33;53:34;"- We can cut this part."
53:34;53:34;"- No, no, we're not cutting this part."
53:34;53:35;"- No, we're not."
53:35;53:36;"- We're not cutting this part."
53:36;53:38;"- You know, I feel like we should just cut this part."
53:38;53:39;"- The fall of Seinfeld."
53:39;53:41;"This is the real fall of Seinfeld."
53:41;53:43;"- How often does that happen?"
53:43;53:45;"Well, anyway, maybe I was just saying it for emphasis."
53:45;53:47;"I heard you and I just wanted to repeat it again"
53:47;53:48;"for the fans."
53:48;53:49;"- No, I forgive you."
53:49;53:50;"Although I do want to point out"
53:50;53:51;"that this is the type of thing"
53:51;53:55;"that if it happened in middle school or something,"
53:55;53:56;"would upend society."
53:56;53:59;"Just to any of our younger fans,"
53:59;54:00;"this is the type of thing,"
54:00;54:01;"if you're in like in middle school"
54:01;54:02;"and like a bunch of people are joking about something"
54:02;54:04;"and you're, I feel like,"
54:04;54:06;"I'm pretty sure I was on both sides of this."
54:06;54:08;"Almost every kid is."
54:08;54:10;"Where, you know, just like middle school,"
54:10;54:12;"you're so terrified of making a mistake or something."
54:12;54:14;"Actually, I can remember one time"
54:14;54:15;"I was a little bit like this"
54:15;54:17;"because I know nothing about sports,"
54:17;54:19;"but I have a long history of trying to pretend that I do."
54:19;54:21;"I remember a bunch of kids were talking about like,"
54:21;54:23;"who is like the best player in the NBA."
54:23;54:24;"And kids were like,"
54:24;54:25;"well, obviously, you know,"
54:25;54:27;"Shaquille O'Neal right now, blah, blah, blah, blah."
54:27;54:30;"And then I was just like, what about Shaq?"
54:30;54:30;"(laughing)"
54:30;54:32;"- Oh my God."
54:32;54:33;"- I didn't know, man."
54:33;54:36;"I just heard people talking about Shaq, Shaquille."
54:36;54:38;"It's kind of pronounced differently."
54:38;54:41;"Shaquille is Shaq."
54:41;54:42;"Not Shaq."
54:42;54:44;"It's not Shaquille."
54:44;54:45;"Or maybe it is."
54:45;54:46;"But anyway."
54:46;54:49;"- I think the takeaway is that I was just so focused on,"
54:49;54:51;"you know, crunching those numbers that I,"
54:51;54:54;"hey, we can cut this part."
54:54;54:57;"So let's talk about, let's talk about Grammys."
54:57;55:00;"Okay, Ezra, congratulations on your Grammy nominations."
55:00;55:00;"- Oh, thank you."
55:00;55:02;"- Burying the lead."
55:02;55:03;"- We buried the lead."
55:03;55:04;"- Congrats."
55:04;55:05;"I feel bad now."
55:05;55:07;"I feel like I should have brought this up earlier."
55:07;55:09;"- Yeah, I was just kind of waiting."
55:09;55:12;"Well, I guess to be fair,"
55:12;55:13;"Jake, did we ever get you registered"
55:13;55:15;"to vote for the Grammys?"
55:15;55:16;"- Yet another year goes by."
55:16;55:17;"- Oh my God."
55:17;55:20;"- We're probably gonna lose everything by one vote."
55:20;55:23;"(laughing)"
55:23;55:24;"This was a big year for us"
55:24;55:27;"because we got nominated in three categories."
55:27;55:28;"Best Alternative Album."
55:28;55:30;"That's the one that Modern Vampire's won."
55:30;55:31;"That's happened already."
55:31;55:32;"- Old hat."
55:32;55:33;"- I mean, you know, it's still exciting,"
55:33;55:35;"but we've experienced that."
55:35;55:37;"The other two are a little more interesting."
55:37;55:38;"One is Album of the Year"
55:38;55:41;"because that means finally we're gonna be on TV."
55:41;55:43;"- Who else got nominated in that?"
55:43;55:44;"- Number Crunch Seinfeld."
55:44;55:47;"- Bonnie Vare, Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish."
55:47;55:49;"- H-E-R, her?"
55:49;55:54;"Is that Ariana Grande, Lil Nas X, Lizzo,"
55:54;55:55;"and Vampire Weekend."
55:55;55:57;"- It's a pretty wild group."
55:57;55:58;"- And that's like eight nominees."
55:58;55:59;"Tough odds."
55:59;56:00;"- It's tough odds."
56:00;56:01;"- I was thinking it'd be five."
56:01;56:04;"- In fact, my buddy I saw in New York told me"
56:04;56:06;"that he'd put some money on us winning."
56:06;56:07;"- Tight."
56:07;56:09;"- And I said, ""Well, what are the biggest odds?"""
56:09;56:12;"And he's like, ""No joke, it's 62 to one."""
56:12;56:13;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
56:13;56:13;"- Who's favored?"
56:13;56:14;"- I didn't ask him."
56:14;56:18;"I would guess Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish,"
56:18;56:19;"Ariana Grande, Lizzo."
56:19;56:21;"Those are maybe the more."
56:21;56:22;"We're definitely in the bottom half."
56:22;56:25;"I feel like the dark horses would be us, Lil Nas X,"
56:25;56:28;"which just kind of rules 'cause he's nominated for an EP."
56:28;56:29;"It's 18 minutes long."
56:29;56:30;"- Oh, wow."
56:30;56:32;"- That'd be cool if that won just to--"
56:32;56:33;"- EP."
56:33;56:34;"- Just to upend society."
56:34;56:36;"But I think the fact that it's so stacked"
56:36;56:40;"sometimes means that it's anybody's, anything could happen."
56:40;56:40;"- Yeah."
56:40;56:42;"- Low-key, I was doing an interview last week."
56:42;56:47;"We played this radio festival for 92.3 in New York."
56:47;56:48;"Guy asked me like, ""All right, man,"
56:48;56:49;"""you've nominated for some Grammys."
56:49;56:50;"""Let's say you win Album of the Year."
56:50;56:52;"""What's the first thoughts going through your head"
56:52;56:54;"""as you're walking your way to the podium?"""
56:54;56:55;"And truly the first thing I thought of"
56:55;56:58;"was other people's fans being angry."
56:58;57:01;"Just like Lana Del Rey fans being like,"
57:01;57:02;"""Who the (beep) are these losers?"""
57:02;57:06;"Billie Eilish fans being like, ""What is this old bull (beep)?"""
57:06;57:07;"And me being there like,"
57:07;57:10;"""I don't know what to say to you guys."""
57:10;57:11;"I don't even wanna talk about that one."
57:11;57:12;"Album of the Year is just kind of stressful."
57:12;57:14;"- The third nomination."
57:14;57:16;"- This is the one I wanna talk about."
57:16;57:20;"Third nomination, Harmony Hall, Best Rock Song."
57:20;57:22;"- Oh, wow, that is interesting."
57:22;57:25;"- Seinfeld, what are the nominees in Best Rock Song?"
57:25;57:27;"And one thing, Best Rock Song,"
57:27;57:29;"there's different categories where you could be nominated."
57:29;57:30;"Like the recording gets nominated,"
57:30;57:32;"and then the producer is not,"
57:32;57:34;"and the art of the band is."
57:34;57:35;"This is just as a songwriter."
57:35;57:37;"So I'm nominated."
57:37;57:38;"- Just the publishing."
57:38;57:39;"- Right."
57:39;57:41;"- Not the recording or the performance."
57:41;57:42;"- This is not a Vampire Weekend nomination."
57:42;57:44;"This is me as a songwriter."
57:44;57:48;"- You're up against Tool, The 1975,"
57:48;57:52;"Brittany Howard, and Gary Clark Jr."
57:52;57:53;"- Dude, you're gonna clean up."
57:53;57:54;"- I don't know what our odds are."
57:54;57:56;"Probably a little better than Album of the Year,"
57:56;57:57;"but this is what I wanted to talk about."
57:57;57:59;"- Is this award on TV?"
57:59;58:00;"- I don't think so."
58:00;58:01;"I think only Album of the Year."
58:01;58:02;"- Okay."
58:02;58:04;"- Which is the final award."
58:04;58:05;"Yeah, truly Album of the Year."
58:05;58:08;"I truly think it is an honor just to be nominated."
58:08;58:09;"- Yeah, it's amazing."
58:09;58:10;"I can't even--"
58:10;58:12;"- The other ones are a little more interesting to me."
58:12;58:13;"The thing I wanted to bring up,"
58:13;58:14;"'cause I wanna get Jake's take on this."
58:14;58:17;"- I'm gonna bet, by the way, on Album of the Year."
58:17;58:19;"- You're gonna take the 62 to one odds?"
58:19;58:22;"- Yeah, it's gonna be like when Arcade Fire won."
58:22;58:23;"Didn't they win Album of the Year?"
58:23;58:24;"- Yeah."
58:24;58:26;"- All right, that's what's gonna happen."
58:26;58:27;"- Or Beck."
58:27;58:28;"- I'm gonna put down $100."
58:28;58:29;"- I wouldn't wanna win Album of the Year"
58:29;58:32;"if somebody ran on stage, say I didn't deserve it."
58:32;58:34;"See, that's the thing."
58:34;58:36;"I felt like when Kanye ran on stage when Beck won,"
58:36;58:37;"Beck had this look on his face,"
58:37;58:40;"and he's a laid back, mellow dude, kind of vibe guy,"
58:40;58:41;"and he was almost like,"
58:41;58:43;"the look on his face was almost like,"
58:43;58:45;"yeah, yeah, man, I don't know."
58:45;58:47;"Maybe I shouldn't be up here."
58:47;58:49;"- So Justin Vernon's gonna get up there and be like,"
58:49;58:51;"pfft, the hell is this?"
58:51;58:52;"- Friend of the show."
58:52;58:54;"- Friend of the show."
58:54;58:56;"Something changed, became an enemy of the show."
58:56;58:58;"- Father of the bride winning, get out of here."
58:58;59:00;"- This clearly is Lizzo's trophy."
59:00;59:01;"- He takes it out of your hands."
59:01;59:02;"- Yeah."
59:02;59:04;"- Okay, so Rock Song of the Year."
59:04;59:05;"- But that's the one that I wanted to talk about"
59:05;59:07;"on the show, because that's the one"
59:07;59:09;"that I was kind of the most psyched about,"
59:09;59:11;"because it's a songwriting award,"
59:11;59:14;"and songwriting's very important to me."
59:14;59:16;"It's a pretty random mix in there,"
59:16;59:18;"but rock is pretty random in 2019."
59:18;59:20;"But here's the thing, on Instagram,"
59:20;59:23;"there's a Vampire Weekend post about the nominations,"
59:23;59:25;"and I'm looking at some of the comments,"
59:25;59:28;"you know, we had a lot of fans very proud of us,"
59:28;59:30;"and you know, it was tight, very heartwarming"
59:30;59:32;"to see that they felt like they were a part of it,"
59:32;59:33;"which they should feel."
59:33;59:35;"And then you had a few people, not exactly haters,"
59:35;59:38;"but fans being like, best rock song?"
59:38;59:40;"You know, eye roll kind of vibe?"
59:40;59:43;"And so I see a few of these, and I'm just like,"
59:43;59:44;"what the (beep) is that supposed to mean?"
59:44;59:46;"And then I had a brief exchange with one dude"
59:46;59:50;"who said, basically, like, this is not a rock song."
59:50;59:51;"And I was kind of like, look,"
59:51;59:52;"there's a lot of Vampire Weekend songs"
59:52;59:54;"I wouldn't call rock songs, but I was like,"
59:54;59:56;"it's got a (beep) guitar solo, or whatever."
59:56;59:58;"So this dude, I said, are you familiar"
59:58;01:00:01;"with the tasteful palette of 1970s rock?"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- Oh, I think I saw this."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- And then it became this whole thing"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"where like, I felt bad, was it a pile on?"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"And I don't even know how old this person is,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"or what their take is."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"But okay, this is my gut feeling based on,"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"and like, there are totally people who are like,"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"yeah, obviously it's a rock song,"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"but this is my gut feeling, is that the definition of rock,"
01:00:18;01:00:20;"maybe to the younger generations,"
01:00:20;01:00:24;"has narrowed to an even like, smaller place"
01:00:24;01:00:25;"than back in the day."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Sure."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- Like maybe to some younger people, rock is just like--"
01:00:29;01:00:29;"- Heavy."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Yeah, it's kind of like heavy."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"- Like tool."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"- Like yeah, on one side of the spectrum,"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"maybe is like, Jet, or Greta Van Fleet,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"is like, down, down, down, down, down."
01:00:38;01:00:39;"- Yeah."
01:00:39;01:00:39;"- And then on the other side is just like,"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"true like, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"'Cause I'm kind of like, acoustic guitar riff,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"and you know, pentatonic riff and harmony,"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"I mean, that's rock, man."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"- And then kind of like, stonesy, kind of piano groove."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"- I know, I think the idea of even being like,"
01:00:50;01:00:54;"that's rock piano, maybe doesn't compute for some people."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"And I was also kind of like, well, what else is it?"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"- Adult contemporary."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"- But even adult--"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- Yeah, no, I'm kidding, I mean, it's--"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"- Yeah, so I was just kind of like--"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- If you're like a 15 year old kid,"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"and you've listened to like, Nirvana and Tool,"
01:01:05;01:01:09;"and The Strokes, there's not a lot of bands"
01:01:09;01:01:13;"that are like, doing kind of like, a kinks, stonesy,"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"deady, little more low key, melodic kind of thing."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"- Yeah, I know."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"- Like, maybe you've heard The Shins,"
01:01:20;01:01:23;"and that's sort of like, what is this oldies act"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"kind of thing?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"- Maybe they consider it pop."
01:01:26;01:01:26;"- Maybe, but pop is a--"
01:01:26;01:01:27;"- But pop is a--"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"- Clearly not pop."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- Well, and I guess--"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"- To someone that loves Tool."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Right."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- Although, arguably, like, that Tool--"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Have you thought of that Tool song?"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"I'm kind of curious what the Tool--"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- No, because the Tool is not like,"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"straight ahead rock either."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"Tool is like, prog--"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"- It's mathy, but it's real heavy."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"- And that song has like, hand drums and stuff."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"- Does it?"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- Yeah, wait, I gotta put it on."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- Tool song that you're gonna be competing with."
01:01:47;01:01:51;"Ezra, toe to toe against Maynard."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"- That would be a funny one to win."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"If there was one that we were gonna win,"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"I think it should be best rock song."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Partially because that'd be the most fun one"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"to make a speech for."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"- Yeah, dude."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"- Ladies and gentlemen, rock music."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- Alive and well, not played out dog."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"- Not played out dog."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I wanna tell you a story."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"My buddy Jake, once was working with a gentleman."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"(laughing)"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"- They were on lunch break, eating Chipotle."
01:02:16;01:02:19;"- This guy took a big bite of his burrito"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"and said, ""Rock's played out dog."""
01:02:21;01:02:22;"I'm here to tell you it's not."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"And although we have won the award today,"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"I consider this a win for all of us in the rock community."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Maynard Ferguson, I'm looking at you."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- Hats off to you, sir."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"- Hats off to you."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Brittany Howard."
01:02:35;01:02:39;"- I raise a glass to you, ma'am."
01:02:39;01:02:43;"- Gary Clark Jr., absolute shredder."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"The 1975, they're from across the pond."
01:02:46;01:02:49;"- Very cool, I like your kind of David Bowie thing"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"you're doing, very cool."
01:02:51;01:02:56;"- Very cool, England has contributed so much to rock history."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"I'm getting into a very specific--"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"- Story of history."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"- I'm doing like, this is like one of the guys"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"from SNL does this voice."
01:03:03;01:03:03;"(mimics voice)"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Wait, who is, I love that guy."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- Beck Bennett."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- Oh, Beck Bennett, this is a Beck Bennett character."
01:03:08;01:03:12;"Maybe we should ask Beck Bennett to go on and accept."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"From the Rolling Stones to David Bowie"
01:03:14;01:03:17;"to even the Cure and Oasis, England has produced many"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"of the greatest rock bands of our time."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"You continue to fly that flag high."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"That Union Jack."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- He's becoming like Kyle Mooney a little bit."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- And now he's becoming Kyle Mooney."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"This is the Tool song, wait."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"- Is the Tool song Fear Inoculum, the title track"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"from the album Fear Inoculum?"
01:03:34;01:03:34;"- Uh, yeah."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"- So, this song is 10 minutes 20 seconds, so."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"- Wow."
01:03:40;01:03:40;"- Kind of harsh opening."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"(bells chime)"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"- That's very like, early mid 70's,"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"that like a 10 minute rock song."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"- Yeah."
01:03:49;01:03:49;"- He nominated."
01:03:49;01:03:52;"(bells chime)"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"- So these kids, they accept this is rock,"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"but Harmony Hall is not."
01:03:57;01:03:58;"(bells chime)"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"♪ White and white satin ♪"
01:04:02;01:04:02;"(bells chime)"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"- Made it first then."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"You sir are a freaking legend."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"- Love your stuff bro."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"(bells chime)"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"(laughs)"
01:04:14;01:04:19;"- Also, it's really funny too that a lot of those awards,"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"the pre-televised awards, it's never like everybody's there."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"It's always has this like, kind of sad half full vibe."
01:04:26;01:04:29;"Which is why when we won last album, Best Alternative,"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I was just like, thanks."
01:04:30;01:04:33;"'Cause it's so, it's like to give a heartfelt speech"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"in front of just like, a half full disinter-"
01:04:36;01:04:36;"Hey listen to this."
01:04:39;01:04:43;"But, I'm just picturing like,"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"Vampire Weekend's the only people there."
01:04:46;01:04:48;"And then I just write this like, real heartfelt note"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"to each of the other nominees who just aren't in attendance."
01:04:51;01:04:54;"Mayor Ferguson and the rest of your band mates in Tool,"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"you've shown that rock is far from restricted"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"to a four four time signature."
01:04:59;01:05:03;"Or a three and a half minute pop song structure."
01:05:03;01:05:06;"- Over a nearly 30 year career,"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"you've consistently pushed the boundaries"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"of what's possible."
01:05:10;01:05:16;"- The 1975, your words to Imagine Dragons"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"were harsh, but fair."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Perhaps I just-"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"(laughs)"
01:05:25;01:05:29;"Mr. Healy, perhaps I judge you unfairly."
01:05:29;01:05:33;"When I took you to task for your cruel words"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"about Dan Reynolds and Imagine Dragons,"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"now I understand what you were doing."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"You're trying to push him to be better,"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"just like we're all trying to be better"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"in the genre of rock."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"(laughs)"
01:05:43;01:05:48;"- Would you cap it off with one for yourself?"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"- And last but not least,"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"myself and the rest of Vampire Weekend."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"- That'd be like the Matthew McConaughey,"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"just like, if I can step outside myself for a second,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"I'm so (beep) proud of you."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"You're still rocking."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"11 years since the release of your debut album."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- Yeah, it's like the really sweet"
01:06:07;01:06:10;"high school football player that's a little dim."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"(laughs)"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Just like, just a sweetheart of a guy."
01:06:14;01:06:19;"I'm not a fan of this music."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"- I kind of am."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"I'm kind of into it, but all I'm saying is--"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"- How is that up for songwriting?"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"That is, I'm sorry."
01:06:30;01:06:34;"Like, Tool's written some catchy stuff, but what?"
01:06:34;01:06:34;"- Well, skip ahead."
01:06:34;01:06:37;"- That is just like, that's not--"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"- Let's just see, where does this go?"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"All right, time's, okay, I'm kind of into this."
01:06:43;01:06:46;"This is cool, kind of dusty."
01:06:46;01:06:50;"♪ Hurt me and purge me and evacuate ♪"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"♪ Send out an army ♪"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"- This sucks."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"(laughs)"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"I mean, come on, like, for songwriting?"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- Okay, it's still sound."
01:07:00;01:07:04;"- This is like a very deep cut on like melancholy,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"calling it infinite sadness or something."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- I can't be mad at that, I like it."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"- I'm not mad that it exists,"
01:07:09;01:07:13;"I'm mad that it was nominated for best rock songwriting."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"- There's also rock performance."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"That's more-- - Give it to that, man."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- Have you seen Tool's like onstage getups?"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Like how they--"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"- Wait, is that a Starbucks logo?"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"- It's like a subversive, it says like, I want,"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"what does it say, I love something in coffee,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"it's covered by his arm,"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"but he's wearing like some sort of SWAT--"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"- It's like the SWAT team meets Darth Vader,"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"meets Starbucks."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"- Kind of Marilyn Manson vibe."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"- Yeah."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- Tool's always a little too dark for me."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"- Yeah, I'd always like hear a Tool song"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"and be like, okay, tight, but yeah,"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"that could never go--"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"- I remember there were just like dudes"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"in my dorm in college who were like really into Tool."
01:07:46;01:07:50;"Dudes would just be like playing like an unplugged bass."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- Just playing Tool riffs?"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"- Yeah, just like Metallica and Tool riffs."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"- On a six string bass?"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"- Like two in the afternoon on like a unplugged bass."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"- Well, Tool has produced some very iconic riffs."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"(mimics guitar riff)"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- For sure."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- Maynard Ferguson."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"Wait, wait, oh wait, what's his name?"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"- Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"- Oh my God, I wasn't even kidding."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Wait, who's Maynard Ferguson?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Is that like a jazz musician?"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"- Let's see."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"- No, I'm actually embarrassed 'cause I like Tool."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Yeah, Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"He's a Birdland jazz musician."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"He's a Canadian jazz trumpeter."
01:08:22;01:08:22;"- Oh really?"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"- Yeah."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"Also worthy of respect."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"- That'd be even weirder."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Just get up there."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"I'm so impressed by all the nominees tonight."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"Maynard Ferguson, Canadian jazz trumpeter."
01:08:32;01:08:35;"- Rest in peace."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"- Rest in peace."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"Maynard James Keenan."
01:08:38;01:08:44;"- Well, dude, I hope you win for best rock song."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- God, and you can't even vote for us?"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Damn."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Honestly, at least I know that I,"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"just knowing that I would have had your vote"
01:08:51;01:08:52;"if you were registered to vote,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"that's very meaningful to me, Jake."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"- Hell yeah, dude."
01:08:55;01:08:55;"- You know what?"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"We might come up goose eggs."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"- We might go up for three."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"- We might go up for three."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"I'm prepared for it."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"- Well, the TC community's there for you, bud."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"- All right, thanks to the TC heads."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"I'd like to think that anybody who's a TC head,"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"whether they think we deserve to win or not,"
01:09:08;01:09:11;"would at least admit we deserve to be in the category"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"of rock."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"It's a fricking rock song."
01:09:13;01:09:14;"- Undoubtedly."
01:09:14;01:09:17;"If you're confused by that, you don't know your rock, folks."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"- Yeah, you don't know your rock."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"- Learn about your rock."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"- I would also just say in 2019,"
01:09:22;01:09:26;"if given the chance between expanding the definition of rock"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"to include the tasteful palette of 1970s rock,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"instruments like piano, things like that,"
01:09:31;01:09:34;"or contracting the definition of rock"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"to essentially just be Greta Van Fleet and Jet,"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"we gotta go big, people."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"- Who's Jet?"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I thought Jet was like an '80s band."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"- No, they were like early 2000s."
01:09:43;01:09:45;"They were kind of throwback rock, like,"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"""Are you gonna be my girl?"""
01:09:47;01:09:49;"- Oh, I hate that."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Jet sucks."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"- Yeah, I don't think they suck, but--"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"- Oh, I've always wondered what that was,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"'cause you'll hear that in bad sports bars,"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"and you're just like, ""What is this?"""
01:09:57;01:09:59;"- Wait, hold on. - It's Jet."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"- You might've felt that way back in the day, but--"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"- Now that the dust has settled, let's revisit Jet."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"- They infamously got this incredibly cruel,"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"petty pitchfork review,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"where they didn't even write about it."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"They just put a video of a monkey (beep) in its mouth"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"and gave a 0.0."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"- Oh, well, you gotta write about it."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"You can't just do that."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"What year was that? - Although, in a way--"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- 2006."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"- Okay."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"As somebody who's been reviewed many times over the years,"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"I do actually respect the ""(beep) this (beep) sucks"""
01:10:28;01:10:32;"line of criticism a little more"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"than the half-baked essay,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"where people try to make a grandiose statement"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"about the meaning of the music, which always--"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"- Yeah."
01:10:39;01:10:42;"- 'Cause actually, I do respect the right of people"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"to just be like, ""This (beep) sucks."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"""I don't like the voice."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"""Voice singer sucks."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"""Vibe sucks."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"""Corny, I hate it."""
01:10:48;01:10:50;"So in some ways, it's mean."
01:10:50;01:10:53;"- Also, Jet, I imagine, doesn't give a,"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"doesn't care about Pitchfork."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"- No, there's actually an article in ""Slate"""
01:10:56;01:10:58;"with the dude from Jet talking about how it, like,"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"that review had a significant impact on their career."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"- What? - I remember reading this, yeah."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"- Wow."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"- This is from actually just last year."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"I wanted to ask him about Pitchfork's 0.0 review"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"of ""Shine On."""
01:11:11;01:11:12;"I'm not gonna be able to distill it down,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"but it seems like it was a traumatic thing."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"- Wow. - For this band."
01:11:15;01:11:18;"- I mean, okay, I'm sure it did hurt his feelings."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"- Oh, I'm sure of that, but--"
01:11:19;01:11:22;"- I would say, luckily, well, in the early days,"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"Vampire Weekend got some real, like,"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"just hyper-personal takedowns and stuff."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"- You guys got super harshed on."
01:11:27;01:11:30;"I remember when you guys, when this record was coming out,"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"and it was like, ""Jesus Christ."""
01:11:31;01:11:33;"- But it was often more, we got it worse"
01:11:33;01:11:36;"in, like, think pieces than maybe reviews."
01:11:36;01:11:37;"- Right. - I mean, of course,"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"we've had bad, literally every album has had"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"at least one or two bad reviews."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"It's never been, like, a full wave."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Actually, it was funny, I was kinda looking back through it,"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"and there's a kinda one dip (beep)"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"on Contra, wrote this thing, was like,"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"""You know, there's some moments,"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"""but it's painfully obvious these guys have nothing to say."""
01:11:56;01:11:57;"And I was just kinda like, ""Man,"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"""you didn't give this (beep) a chance."""
01:11:59;01:12:01;"But whatever, people say we're (beep)"
01:12:01;01:12:02;"and then I remember, like, on the--"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"- The first song was about horchata."
01:12:03;01:12:04;"- Dude. - Of course we have"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"things to say. - Dude, we--"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"- Get your head outta here. - We're pushing"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"in a new direction."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"But even on the third album, there was, like,"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"one harsh review, there was, like,"
01:12:11;01:12:12;"some incredibly glum reviews,"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"and there was one harsh review that was just like,"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"""Yo, I like the first two albums."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"""This (beep) sucks."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"""Jesus Christ, this is boring."""
01:12:19;01:12:20;"- Wow."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"- So whatever, of course, you're only gonna get one or two,"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"but I would say, though, and obviously,"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"I can't speak to the gentleman from Jet,"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"obviously, it's easy for me, sitting back here,"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"to be like, ""You know, get a 0.0,"
01:12:30;01:12:31;"""the monkey (beep) in your mouth."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"""That's like--"" - Kinda respected."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"- Kinda respected."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"But the truth is, at least,"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"that's just like some old school bully (beep)."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"- Yeah. - They're just kinda like,"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"""(beep) you, we're not down with you, loser."""
01:12:42;01:12:44;"And that is the type of (beep) that hurts,"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"but even the person who gets bullied in that way,"
01:12:47;01:12:50;"I don't think they understand the world of pain."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Like, imagine they go home, they're just like,"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"""The guy said I couldn't sit with them at the table."""
01:12:54;01:12:56;"And then, like, your parents are like,"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"""You go sit down with them, and you say,"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"""you know what, guys?"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"""You've been real jerks to me."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"""I'm gonna stand up for myself right now."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"""Let's talk about this."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"""I'm gonna use my words right now."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"""I'm not gonna just be bullied away from the table."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"""What's your problem with me?"""
01:13:09;01:13:11;"And then the guys are like, ""All right, dude, sit down."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"""Let's get into it."""
01:13:12;01:13:14;"And they're just like, ""Here's the thing, man."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"""It's not that we just have a weird aversion to you."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"""You're not just a loser, you're also a (beep) person."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"""You know, you're not just a humble--"""
01:13:21;01:13:22;"I'm just saying, like-- - Yeah, yeah."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"- There's faith worse than exclusion."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"And I actually have read reviews."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"I don't think I've ever read a vampire one"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"that's this harsh, but I've read reviews of random (beep)"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"where even when I don't like the band or the artist,"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"I am just kind of like, ""Oh my gosh."""
01:13:36;01:13:37;"- I remember Greta Van Fleet--"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- Oh yeah, I was standing up for them."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"- Got super harsh, I think like a year ago, two years ago."
01:13:41;01:13:42;"- Oh yeah, that was just like--"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"- Like a 1.9 or something."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"- Just gleefully dunking on them and like--"
01:13:45;01:13:49;"- Yeah, and they're like, you know, 19-year-old kids."
01:13:49;01:13:49;"- Right."
01:13:49;01:13:51;"- From like Michigan or something."
01:13:51;01:13:52;"- There's definitely a thing, and you know,"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"I've gone deep on this show about my respect for critics,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"and I think at its best, we all are doing the same thing,"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"musicians and critics."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"We're trying to like make commentary"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"about culture and music and stuff."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"I swear, I'm not just trying to be like,"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"try to sound like a neutral on this."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"I really have had critiques from critics"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"who liked one thing, didn't like another thing, whatever,"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"or even just didn't like us,"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"where I actually did think about what they were saying"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"and kind of like, you know,"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"you don't have to agree with somebody,"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"at least in music criticism,"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"to kind of put yourself in their shoes and see their point"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"and still like take something away from it."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Like 100%, I do see a value,"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"like you can't expect everybody to like your (beep)"
01:14:31;01:14:34;"and they're truly, if you can tamp down on your ego,"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"you can learn something from negative stuff."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"- Sure."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"- But there is this like line that's crossed,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"and I feel like sometimes people don't,"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"there is a type of person they just don't understand"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"that like, somebody's probably gonna read this (beep)"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"that you wrote, and it's like,"
01:14:47;01:14:52;"you always have a choice between like criticizing something"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"and like putting together something so like cruel"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"that it has the potential to like haunt somebody."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"- Haunt."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"- I've seen this (beep) that people have written"
01:15:00;01:15:01;"about other people where I'm just like,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"yo, you didn't just say it sucked."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"You like took a hatchet to somebody's like existence."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"- The core of their being."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"- I'm not gonna name names 'cause I have great respect"
01:15:10;01:15:14;"for many music writers, such as the legendary Stephen Hyden."
01:15:14;01:15:17;"And there's people I really respect"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"who don't always ride for a vampire."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Even Anthony Fantano,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"apparently he didn't like the last album,"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"but I always had this impression of this guy,"
01:15:24;01:15:26;"like when I've watched his reviews here and there,"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"he's one dude saying his opinions."
01:15:28;01:15:31;"You kinda just gotta be like, all right, you know,"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"like it is what it is."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"And I truly believe, I've always gotten a vibe off of him"
01:15:34;01:15:38;"in my whatever little things that he's a straight shooter."
01:15:38;01:15:42;"I can accept, you know, somebody like that is like,"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"this album sucks."
01:15:43;01:15:44;"It's like, all right, man, maybe like the next one."
01:15:44;01:15:47;"Like, you can't, like, it's all right."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"But yeah, I have seen, there's some people who I've,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I've seen them just write the harshest,"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"most like I'm taking this artist down as a person criticism."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"And then I see them talk about their life as a critic"
01:15:58;01:16:01;"in very sentimental terms."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"That's like a funny thing."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"We're just like the same person who just literally be like,"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"this person, basically this person has no reason"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"to ever make music."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"They're so worthless, blah, blah, blah."
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Then like a few weeks later,"
01:16:11;01:16:14;"can I just say how (beep) proud I am of the team"
01:16:14;01:16:19;"at like musicrolls.net and the listicle we put together"
01:16:20;01:16:24;"of like the seven best indie rock songs of like February."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"Can I just say like, what an honor it is to be,"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"I'm just like, I'm not, and I'm not knocking it"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"because of course you're going to get sentimental"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"about the amount of work it takes"
01:16:32;01:16:33;"to put something into the world,"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"whether it's a listicle or an album."

01:23:01;01:23:03;"I didn't know Tame Impala was Australian."

01:23:04;01:23:04;"- No."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"- Now, Tame Impala, to be fair,"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"it wouldn't be like a top tier Tame song."
01:23:09;01:23:12;"Tame Impala is one of the most successful bands"

01:23:27;01:23:29;"- And then they got kind of like funky,"
01:23:29;01:23:32;"but they had a road song recently."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"- I mean, they were also a little more kind of arty."
01:23:34;01:23:38;"Not so like bar band, AC/DC."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"- Now, I'm just looking at this now as an artist."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"Why do people like this,"
01:23:41;01:23:44;"but they didn't like track five on that Jet album?"
01:23:44;01:23:47;"- Jet's second album, ""The Pitchfork Review"""
01:23:47;01:23:51;"is a sort of a conversation play"
01:23:51;01:23:56;"between a fictional of the owner of a venue and Jet."
01:23:56;01:24:00;"- Oh, I thought the second one was the monkey one."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"Oh, Seinfeld 2000, nice of you to join us, sir."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"- I was just getting some tea."

01:24:07;01:24:09;"- A lot."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"So Pitchfork has just always used Jet"
01:24:12;01:24:16;"as just a punching bag to jumpstart the comedy careers of."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"- I mean, it just feels, it sort of feels gross."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"- Yeah, like two albums in a row,"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"they're being like a joke to us."
01:24:23;01:24:24;"- You're right, sorry, sorry, you're right."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"The first record is ""Get Born"""

01:24:31;01:24:34;"- Look, ""Tame Impala"" is."

01:24:48;01:24:49;"- It's a hipper palette."

01:25:46;01:25:50;"But the Tame Impala, it is like,"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"even what we've heard so far, it's,"
01:25:52;01:25:57;"you got the kind of 70s super tramp keyboard road sound,"
01:25:57;01:26:01;"but then you got these like deeper synth bass moments,"

01:27:26;01:27:28;"and they're just like, Kevin, what you've done"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"for the Australian psych rock community"
01:27:30;01:27:33;"with the global success of Tame Impala is amazing."
01:27:33;01:27:36;"And the truth is, if I can say so myself,"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"Australia, between ACDC and you guys,"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"they didn't produce anything good."
01:27:40;01:27:44;"In fact, they produced some really bad stuff, such as Jet."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"And you know, if you remember, their second album"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"had the monkey (beep) in its mouth,"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"0.0 pitchfork review, and Kevin said,"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"and they're kind of like laughing,"
01:27:52;01:27:55;"and Kevin's like, I fell to see what's so funny about that."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"And they're just like, oh, well, you know,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"everybody hated that album and they kind of made fun"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"of this band, and Kevin's like,"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"I never made fun of that band."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"I looked up to them."
01:28:04;01:28:07;"When I was a young boy in Perth, Australia,"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"there weren't that many rockers"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"five to 10 years older than me."
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Jet was one of them."
01:28:12;01:28:15;"And actually before that, I had dog (beep) taste in music."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"When they first came on, I said, what is this?"
01:28:18;01:28:21;"I heard this kind of amp buzz very quietly in the back of,"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"are you gonna be my girl?"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"And I said to my dad, what's that sound?"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"I'm not used to hearing this in this sterile pop production."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"And he said, well, Kevin, that's a sound you'd associate"
01:28:31;01:28:35;"with a kind of loose feel of analog rock and roll."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"And that set me down a path, an interest in production."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"And I'll tell you what, their second album,"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"I think is even better."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"And in fact, part of the reason that I started Tame Impala"
01:28:43;01:28:48;"was to avenge the absolute disgraceful treatment"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"of my countrymen, Jet."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"And then this person just like, they're like,"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"you gotta be kidding, Kevin."
01:28:53;01:28:56;"They're like, he's like, interview's over, mate."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"(beep)"
01:28:57;01:28:58;"And you know what?"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"I'm never gonna sit down with you again, you jerk."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"- And I'm taking Jet out as the opening act."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"- And then he takes Jet out as the opening act."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"And then he produces their next album."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"- Huge hit."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"- It's just ""Adventure Reverb."""
01:29:07;01:29:10;"- Yeah, you get kind of the best of both worlds."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"You get a little bit of that tame brilliance"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"and you get a little bit of that meat and potatoes, Jet."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"And actually, two plus two equals 10."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"- Gestalt, folks."
01:29:22;01:29:24;"- I love, I want this. - I love this fantasy."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"- I want this to happen."
01:29:26;01:29:28;"- It's all part of my rock and roll fantasy."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"- How old is Kevin Parker?"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"- Should we guess?"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"34."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"- 40."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"- No."
01:29:36;01:29:37;"- I invited that. - Oh, that was your guess?"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"- Yeah, that's my guess."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"No, is that too old?"
01:29:39;01:29:42;"- You're just on thinner and thinner ice today, Seinfeld."
01:29:42;01:29:44;"- Oh, Lord."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"- How old is he?"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"30."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"- He's 33."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"- 33?"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"- Why did I think he was 40?"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"That's not that crazy of a guess, dude."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"- Okay, so he's two years younger than me."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"All right, now how old is Jet?"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"Is Jet Jetterson?"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"- Jet Jetterson."
01:29:59;01:30:00;"- How old is, like, whatever, the guy's in Jet."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"- The singer in Jet."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"- Lead guitarist Cameron Muncy is 39."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"Bassist Mark Wilson is 39."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"And brothers Nick and Chris Sester, both 40."

01:30:17;01:30:18;"just kind of getting into music."

01:36:30;01:36:31;"- She is very chill."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- That's what's amazing about her music,"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"is that it's most so quietly."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"But this is like one of the more hype songs."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"- What, really?"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"- Yeah."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"♪ Like you're really rough, guy ♪"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"♪ Just can't get enough, guy ♪"

01:36:55;01:36:57;"♪ Duh ♪"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"- Duh."
01:36:58;01:37:00;"A little bit of butt head in there."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"- Yep."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"- That '90s love."
01:37:02;01:37:05;"- Anyway, Jake, did you follow the controversy"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"with Billie Eilish and Van Halen?"
01:37:07;01:37:08;"- Yes, I did."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"- Okay, first of all."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"- It seemed like it was kind of set up, though, right?"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"It was on one of those late night shows?"
01:37:13;01:37:13;"- Yeah."
01:37:13;01:37:15;"- You've heard of--"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"- Jimmy Kimmel was just naming stuff, and she said--"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"- Like, who else did he name?"
01:37:18;01:37:19;"- I don't know."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"- Roger Daltrey, have you heard of him?"
01:37:21;01:37:22;"No."
01:37:22;01:37:23;"(laughing)"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Van Halen, no."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"She's heard of Van Halen."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"- Rat, with two Ts."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"- Right."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"I mean, Van Halen coming out of Pasadena,"
01:37:32;01:37:35;"neighboring community to Highland Park."
01:37:35;01:37:35;"- That's true."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"- She knows who Van Halen is."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"- I gotta say, every time I see one of these"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"controversies like this,"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"if you see a bunch of articles like,"
01:37:43;01:37:44;"oh, everybody's freaking out,"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"and you dig a little deeper,"
01:37:45;01:37:48;"and then say you go look on Twitter or something,"
01:37:48;01:37:49;"it's all noise."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"You know, the signal to noise ratio is all messed up"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"because basically you'll find"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"hundreds of thousands of tweets being like,"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"leave Billie Eilish alone."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"She's only 17, of course she doesn't know Van Halen."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"That's old ass music."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"Oh my God, why are all these people so upset?"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"You see all the commentary that's kind of like,"
01:38:05;01:38:06;"leave her alone."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"And then you see, of course, people making jokes,"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"just like, ah, whatever."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"And you're kind of like, where are the outraged tweets?"
01:38:12;01:38:13;"And I'm sure they exist here and there,"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"but it's like-- - Yeah, no one's actually"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"outraged. - Way more people"
01:38:15;01:38:16;"are talking about it."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"Because I think-- - It's hilarious."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- Even if you're like a hardcore Van Halen fan,"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"you're like 55 or something,"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"someone's like, yo, you know that Billie,"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"if you're truly a deep Van Halen fan,"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"you wouldn't know who Billie Eilish is."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"It's a weird thing kind of stoked by people"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"who don't really care about either artist, I think,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"who are just kind of like, stirring the pot."
01:38:35;01:38:37;"This happened a lot in hip hop in the past few years."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"They would ask a young rapper,"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"like, do you care about Tupac?"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"And they'd just be like, not really."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"And then it'd just be like, oh, (beep)"
01:38:44;01:38:45;"But now it kind of feels so like,"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"yeah, like you said, set up."
01:38:47;01:38:48;"- I mean, it's totally conceivable"
01:38:48;01:38:51;"that a 17-year-old has never heard of Van Halen."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"That's not shocking at all."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"- And also-- - I kind of think she has."
01:38:55;01:38:59;"And I think it was just all play acting for the TV show."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"- Well, she's probably pretty savvy."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Like-- - Yeah."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- I'm sure if you're behind closed doors,"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"you're like, if you were going on Jimmy Kimmel,"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"would it be cooler to say you know Van Halen or you don't?"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"It's cooler to say you don't."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"- I would also say, and I might be wrong here,"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"but like, I've never been like deep into Van Halen."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"- Same here."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"- I like what I've heard."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"But I've always been like,"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"I felt like they didn't play much Van Halen"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"on my local rock radio station."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"- Oh, really?"
01:39:22;01:39:22;"I mean, they're playing Jump,"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"they're playing Runnin' with the Devil."
01:39:24;01:39:28;"- Not that, my local station had a kind of anti '80s bias."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"So they weren't playing like-- - I like that."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"- They weren't playing classic rock stuff"
01:39:31;01:39:32;"that was like synthy."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"So like, they'd never play Panama."
01:39:34;01:39:35;"I mean, I'm sure they did here and there."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"But when I think about what they played,"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"I'm thinking like Boston more than a feeling."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"- Oh, sure. - I'm not picturing"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"'80s Van Halen."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"And so I just never felt like I knew Van Halen that much."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"My parents definitely didn't give a (beep) about Van Halen."
01:39:46;01:39:49;"And then I would watch like VH1 or something,"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"and for some reason on VH1 and MTV,"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"whenever they do some like throwback,"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"the song they would always reference is Hot for Teacher."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"So for a long time, I was like,"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"that's the big Van Halen song, Hot for Teacher."
01:39:59;01:40:02;"All right, kind of like a weird goofball novelty song"
01:40:02;01:40:05;"about being horny for your teacher, like, cool."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"- Pretty weak."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"- I was never that big of a fan."
01:40:08;01:40:10;"And then like, you know, I was somewhat familiar"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"with the fact that they like hated each other"
01:40:12;01:40:15;"and that David Lee Roth was kind of like this wild dude."
01:40:15;01:40:16;"So actually I saw them once at the garden."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"I think I've talked about this on the show."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"And I was just kind of like--"
01:40:19;01:40:20;"- You, why didn't you go?"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"- I was just, I don't know, like--"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"- Ain't nothing going on."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- All the cool kids were going."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"I don't know, I was invited to the garden."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"And also I was told that we would be in a box."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"So you know you're gonna be having access to chicken wangs."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"- Wings and fingers."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"- Wangs, fangers."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"- Wangers and fangers."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"- Maybe a Caesar salad."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"- So I'm just saying, I've never been particularly"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"attached to Van Halen."
01:40:41;01:40:44;"So like, I do kind of weirdly feel like,"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"and maybe because I straddled generations,"
01:40:46;01:40:49;"like, you know, my parents weren't paying attention"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"to rock music in the 80s, nor was I."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"So there's a part of me that's kind of like,"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"I could see if you asked a young artist,"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"do you know the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"And they said, no, that would seem like they're fronting"
01:40:59;01:41:02;"because like, you would absolutely have familiarity"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"with the name of those artists."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"Led Zeppelin, Nirvana."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"I actually wouldn't put Van Halen, like,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"they're definitely not top five bands"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"in terms of name recognition."
01:41:13;01:41:14;"- No."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"- So I'm already kind of like,"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"that doesn't seem that weird."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"- Let's put this to the listeners."
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Guys listening at home, do you feel like Billie Eilish"
01:41:20;01:41:24;"knows who Van Halen really is, or was she fronting?"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Tweet us @TimeCrisis2000 on Twitter"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"and follow us while you're there."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"- If you're just tuning in, we've got a breaking story."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"It's some of the biggest controversy"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"in the music industry in years."
01:41:33;01:41:36;"Billie Eilish, her parents, this is awesome."
01:41:36;01:41:39;"This happened like a month ago."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"But--"
01:41:40;01:41:41;"- Maybe it's one of those things where like,"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"she couldn't name a Van Halen song,"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"but if you played her the riff from ""Jump"","
01:41:45;01:41:47;"she'd be like, oh yeah, okay."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Yeah, that's Van Halen, sure."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"- I was getting my haircut down at the Hive."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"(imitates ""Jump"" riff)"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Guys, this is only last week."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- Oh, this is only last week?"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"- Well, this is relatively current for us."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"- Yeah."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"- What is she, like 17, 18?"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"I feel like this would be--"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"- She was definitely born in the 2000s."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"- Right."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"- I feel like this would be like asking you"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"as a teenager if you know, like,"
01:42:06;01:42:09;"the Swig Band all time, you know what I mean?"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"- Wait, yeah."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"- Music from like 40 years ago?"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"- You're talking a band--"
01:42:12;01:42:12;"- That's not true."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"- A band that was massive 20 years before you were born."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"- Ezra, are you familiar with Jerry Lewis and the Playboys?"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"Gary Lewis and the Playboys."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"- No, no, was it Bob Willis and his Texas Playboys?"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Oh no, Gary and the--"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"- I was like mid-60s, like kind of like--"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"- I'm sure if you sat there, Billie Eilish,"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"and you just like grabbed like the Rolling Stone"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"50 most important bands of all time,"
01:42:34;01:42:37;"she'd probably know at least like 25% of it."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"I bet she would know Guns N' Roses."
01:42:39;01:42:40;"- For sure."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"- Also like if you're from LA,"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"I know Van Halen's from LA, but it's like--"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"- Pasadena, dude, neighboring community."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- Neighboring community of Pasadena."
01:42:49;01:42:53;"I would also make the case that Van Halen kind of like,"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"of course they have so many massive songs,"
01:42:54;01:42:57;"but kind of like how I had my weird kind of like"
01:42:57;01:43:00;"confusion with Hot for Teacher being like their big song,"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"they don't have a Welcome to the Jungle."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"- Jump, dude."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"- Jump is hard to wrap your head around in the 2000s."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"- I think that's their biggest song."
01:43:07;01:43:08;"- It's a great song."
01:43:08;01:43:10;"- I think that's as big as Welcome."
01:43:10;01:43:14;"- But Welcome to the Jungle is, it just means more."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"It comes up more in conversation."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"I make a reference to Welcome to the Jungle like once a week."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"- Sure."
01:43:19;01:43:21;"- Because it's the type of thing where something could happen"
01:43:21;01:43:25;"or you enter a new place or somebody refers to things"
01:43:25;01:43:26;"having changed and you can just be like,"
01:43:26;01:43:27;"welcome to the jungle."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"- I remember the week I moved to LA,"
01:43:29;01:43:32;"I met up with my uncle and he was just like,"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"so you moved here, huh?"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"Welcome to the jungle, baby."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"- Yep, see?"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Welcome to the jungle is a very useful phrase,"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"especially when you live in LA."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"- Yep."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"- It's definitely one of the top five best things about LA"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"is that you can say welcome to the jungle all the time."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"- I just did a quick number crunch."
01:43:46;01:43:49;"I just want to call out that Jump hit number one"
01:43:49;01:43:50;"on the Billboard Hot 100."
01:43:50;01:43:53;"Welcome to the Jungle peaked at number seven."
01:43:53;01:43:57;"- Also, Jump was briefly banned from a lot of radio"
01:43:57;01:44:00;"after, that was a famous story, after 9/11,"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"all the big radio conglomerates put out a list of songs"
01:44:02;01:44:05;"to ban that might be triggering for people"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"in a time of national mourning."
01:44:07;01:44:09;"And I specifically remember me being in high school"
01:44:09;01:44:13;"and reading like, Van Halen's Jump will no longer be played."
01:44:13;01:44:14;"And I almost remember me being a kid being like,"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"well, I don't give a (beep)"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"- I hate that so much."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"- Dude, people were jumping from buildings."
01:44:20;01:44:24;"- I know, but dude, that is the most Orwell (beep) ever."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"- That list is really interesting."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"- Frank Sinatra, New York, New York."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"- Banning?"
01:44:30;01:44:31;"- Yeah, come on, 9/11,"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"nobody wouldn't be thinking about New York."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"- Tom Petty, Free Fallin."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"- That is so stupid."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"- Look, I'm not proud of it,"
01:44:38;01:44:42;"but I heard Jump in December, 2001."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"And I did make an angry phone call."
01:44:44;01:44:47;"- You called Clear Channel."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"- Are you out of your goddamn minds?"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"Anyway, time to move on, but."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"- Are we still on the Billie Eilish?"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"- Now we're on Ariana Grande's Seven Rings."
01:44:55;01:44:56;"We heard this song."
01:44:56;01:44:59;"- Is this Small Charcoal Grill?"

01:45:17;01:45:20;"- Yeah, circus core has always been a part of pop music."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"Sometimes it really comes big."
01:45:22;01:45:25;"There's a Britney album I think that's called Circus."
01:45:25;01:45:28;"I'm sure somebody's written an essay or a thesis"
01:45:28;01:45:33;"about the circus being the origins of the American spectacle"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"that became pop music."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"- This is more of like a haunted carnival at night"

01:45:55;01:45:56;"- That was cool."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"- I've always had a soft spot for Ariana"

01:46:11;01:46:14;"- That'd be tight, her next album, Back to Jersey."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"Jersey Plates, Ariana Grande, Jersey Plates."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"- Good title."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"You think Ariana's a Bruce Springsteen fan?"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"- I think she would know."
01:46:21;01:46:25;"- Ariana once shouted out a vampire"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"in a tweet many moons ago."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"- What was the context?"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"- I really like Vampire Weekend, what a cool band,"
01:46:31;01:46:35;"smiley face, colon, bracket, 2010."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"- Well, long time ago. - Long time ago."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"- 4,000 retweets."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- Contra era."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Oh wait, yeah, we actually had some"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"really interesting discussions about Ariana Grande"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"over the past year plus."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Remember we talked about she's vegan,"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"but then she had the kinda cloud macchiato controversy."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"- That's right."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"- What did we say?"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"We said that maybe--"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"- It wasn't vegan, right?"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"- It wasn't vegan, but--"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"- There's like a cloudy egg product in there?"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"- Yeah, there was eggs in it."
01:46:59;01:47:02;"I seem to remember somehow the conversation"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"got to the place of, as somebody with Jersey girl heritage,"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"even if she's vegan, she should still be allowed"
01:47:07;01:47:10;"to eat a Veal Parm sub every now and then."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"- That's right."
01:47:11;01:47:15;"And she's on her PJ, crushing a Veal Parm."
01:47:15;01:47:18;"- If she's in the sky, she can crush a Veal Parm."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"On land, she's a vegan."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"Do you think anybody identifies that way?"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"We were talking about being freegan and stuff like that."
01:47:24;01:47:28;"Is there anybody who's just like, I'm a land vegan."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"And you're just like, what does that mean?"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"They're just like, if I'm in the sky,"
01:47:31;01:47:34;"if I'm in a plane or a helicopter, all bets are off."
01:47:34;01:47:39;"If I'm on a boat, maritime dietary law is totally different."
01:47:39;01:47:41;"I would respect that."
01:47:41;01:47:42;"- Respect it."
01:47:42;01:47:45;"- Look, most people are spending most of their time on land."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"So that's 90--"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"(laughing)"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"- Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch?"
01:47:50;01:47:53;"Average American, what percentage"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"of their life is spent on land?"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"- Now, now, now, now, now, now, now,"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"let's get a number crunch."
01:47:59;01:48:02;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"- It's 94%."
01:48:04;01:48:05;"- Really?"
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- No, I made that up."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"- The fall of Seinfeld."
01:48:09;01:48:10;"- No, no, no."
01:48:10;01:48:15;"But, Arianna Grande is a classic rock fan,"
01:48:15;01:48:19;"having tweeted about Bruce Springsteen and Aerosmith."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"- I like it, she's an East Coast girl."
01:48:21;01:48:25;"She likes Vampire Weekend, Bruce, Aerosmith."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"Even though she grew up in Florida,"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"she never forgets her East Coast roots."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"I gotta ride for Arianna."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"I think it'd be cool to see an Arianna win"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"for album of the year."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"- That'd be tight."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"- If she wins, and then as the little"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Vampire Weekend square fades away,"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"you'll catch me being, nodding."
01:48:41;01:48:45;"And mouthing like, that's a real Jersey girl."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"That's a win for Jersey."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Oh, sorry, real quick sidebar."
01:48:50;01:48:54;"I'll play the next Arianna Grande song as we talk."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"- Oh, she has two on the top five?"
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- Yeah, she crushed it."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"Thank you, next."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"This is a good song."
01:48:58;01:49:01;"Hey, Arianna, being out there for Bernie,"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"gotta love it."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Strong choice."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"- Strong choice, and not only did she tweet at him,"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"they met in person, and she's really shouting him out."
01:49:09;01:49:12;"So, Arianna, you're a legend."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"That's very cool."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"The other thing I was gonna say is,"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"we talk a lot about branded Twitter on this program,"
01:49:18;01:49:23;"and recently, the latest account to go really viral"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"was New Jersey."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"New Jersey has a Twitter account."
01:49:25;01:49:26;"- I miss this."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"- And they've been kinda tweeting wild stuff,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"and somebody said, this is the official New Jersey account,"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"and somebody tweeted at them,"
01:49:32;01:49:35;"who gave New Jersey a Twitter account?"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"You know, trying to talk (beep)"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"and New Jersey quote tweeted and wrote, your mom."
01:49:38;01:49:41;"How many retweets does that currently have, Seinfeld?"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"- So that's an employee of like the state,"
01:49:43;01:49:44;"state tourism board."
01:49:44;01:49:44;"- I think technically--"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"- That's such an on-brand Jersey response."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"- I was talking about it with Cousin Asher."
01:49:48;01:49:51;"He's also a Jersey guy, and he was like,"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"no other state could tweet that,"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"and it would feel on-brand."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"And then I was like, what about Florida?"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"He was like, Florida would be like way harsher."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"Just like, go (beep) yourself."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"My (beep)"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"- That's 83,000 retweets right there."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"- 83,000 retweets."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"- Two words."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"- So I saw that, and I was kinda like, you know what?"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"We talk so much (beep) about the people"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"running these lame brand Twitters, but I love it."
01:50:13;01:50:14;"I got nothing to sell."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"It's just Jersey being Jersey."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"I actually liked it."
01:50:16;01:50:19;"And then I see Steakums trying to get in the mix."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"- Oh, jeez."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"- I was just like, go to hell."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Steakums, New Jersey was,"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"we talked about it on the show once,"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"the pork roll versus Taylor ham."
01:50:29;01:50:30;"Two different words in different parts of Jersey"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"for the same meat product."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"And so they were, like Jersey was like,"
01:50:34;01:50:35;"which is your favorite?"
01:50:35;01:50:40;"And then Steakums was like, um, what about us?"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"And then Jersey like quote tweeted,"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"but what about you?"
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Also being snarky, but I was like,"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"now I'm seeing Steakums whack brand quote tweeted by Jersey."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"I don't like this."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"And I actually thought about,"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"I didn't wanna get involved,"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"but I thought about tweeting at Jersey like,"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"guys, you're off to a great start."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"You've won the hearts of the nation."
01:50:59;01:51:02;"Don't engage with these (beep) sharks."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"If they wanna horse around with like the Connecticut Twitter,"
01:51:05;01:51:06;"that's fun."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"- I love that, state on state."
01:51:08;01:51:09;"- Yeah."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"Yo, I just realized something."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"Sorry, Ariana."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"Thank you, next is an unequivocally great song,"
01:51:14;01:51:15;"but we don't need to talk about it."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I just realized something, Jake."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"- What?"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"- Goose is from Connecticut."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"Mahali is from Jersey."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"Twiddle versus Goose is,"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"whether or not they actually have beef,"
01:51:25;01:51:28;"it is an intra tri-state rivalry."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"- It's a tri-state showdown."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"- So actually-- - That's big."
01:51:31;01:51:34;"- The Twiddle vampire tour is a Jersey tour."
01:51:34;01:51:37;"A Mountain Brews Goose tour would be a Connecticut tour."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"But maybe we could somehow make it a fun thing"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"where it's the New Jersey versus Connecticut tour."
01:51:41;01:51:44;"- Kind of like there was a Drake versus Lil Wayne tour."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"I don't know what happened on that tour,"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"but there was some element of gamesmanship."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"What happened?"
01:51:48;01:51:50;"- They fought each other, right?"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"- Yeah, they fought each other."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"(laughing)"
01:51:53;01:51:53;"- It was just like a straight up UFC cage match."
01:51:53;01:51:58;"- That was a very well done, high concept tour"
01:51:58;01:52:03;"where they would each come out and do their own set,"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"and then they would perform the last set sort of together."
01:52:06;01:52:10;"And in the audience, you could rate who performed better."
01:52:10;01:52:11;"- Well, like using an app or something?"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"- Yeah, but they had also, it was a tiered stage."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"So like every, it was done like a video game."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"They actually had the people that designed Tekken"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"design all of the merch."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"It was really pretty wild."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"- It was like Marvel versus Capcom."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"- Yeah, or Twiddle versus Goose."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"- Marvel versus Scorsese."
01:52:29;01:52:32;"In my day, we were just worried about Marvel versus Capcom."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"(laughing)"
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Hyper specific."
01:52:35;01:52:35;"- Oh yeah, Capcom is who designed it."
01:52:35;01:52:38;"- Jake, do you know what Marvel versus Capcom is?"
01:52:38;01:52:38;"- No."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"- Right."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"- What's Capcom?"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"- Capcom is a video game company."
01:52:41;01:52:43;"They made like Street Fighter and stuff."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"So that was a video game where you could play like,"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"you'd be like Spider-Man versus Blanca."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"- That's actually who designed it."
01:52:48;01:52:51;"Capcom is the one who designed the tour."
01:52:51;01:52:54;"- I like the idea that we make this one giant show."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"It's Connecticut versus Jersey."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"- Yeah."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"- Of course, like any kind of showdown,"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"like the Super Bowl, it has to be on neutral ground."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"- California."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"- Could be California."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"- Troubadour."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"(laughing)"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"- Could be at the Troubadour."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"- We are here in the great state of Oklahoma."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"(laughing)"
01:53:14;01:53:18;"To bring you good people of Oklahoma,"
01:53:18;01:53:22;"we have brought a regional conflict to your great state."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"(laughing)"
01:53:24;01:53:27;"Konichiwa, Osaka."
01:53:27;01:53:30;"(laughing)"
01:53:30;01:53:33;"It's like the most neutral place."
01:53:33;01:53:34;"Oh no, you know what it is?"
01:53:34;01:53:37;"It's The Hague in the Netherlands."
01:53:37;01:53:40;"- Oh my God, that sounds so uninspiring."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"(laughing)"
01:53:41;01:53:45;"- Okay, the number two song, Post Malone and Sway Lee,"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"Sunflower."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"This is a massive song."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"- Well, it's a cool one."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"- Yes, it's a good song."
01:53:54;01:53:59;"♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪"
01:53:59;01:54:05;"♪ Hey, hey ♪"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"- So far, everything kind of mellow."
01:54:11;01:54:11;"- Yeah."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"- It's a mellow year."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"♪ Innocent say I keep my check ♪"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"♪ She was a bad, bad, nevertheless ♪"
01:54:18;01:54:18;"- Great song."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"Post Malone just continues to crush it."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"This song was already his old news for him."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"This song came out in 2018, actually."
01:54:25;01:54:28;"He's got a big song with Ozzy Osbourne right now."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"- Right, I think we heard it on the show."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"- Yeah."
01:54:30;01:54:32;"- Do you think Billie Eilish has heard it with him?"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- Ozzy?"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"- Definitely."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"- From the show?"
01:54:36;01:54:36;"- Yeah, from reality TV."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Well, I was thinking about she would have been"
01:54:37;01:54:41;"really young when the show was popping."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"I mean, I hate to say it, I don't wanna wade into"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"what already is a fake controversy"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"that nobody actually cares about,"
01:54:47;01:54:50;"but I like some of the Van Halen stuff,"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"but they're freaking random."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"- I'm sorry, Van Halen's freaking random."
01:54:55;01:54:55;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- They're stuck in an era, you're saying."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"- Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"They're freaking random."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"- Right."
01:55:00;01:55:04;"Dude, I was talking to this contractor last week."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"- About what kind of rock he was into?"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"- Well, actually, it did come up."
01:55:08;01:55:12;"He told me that he's a big Ozzy fan"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"that he doesn't like Sabbath."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"- What the hell?"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- And I was like, what the hell?"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"This guy was like mid-50s."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"And he's like, I'm really into the crazy train stuff."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"And he's like-- - He's a Randy Rhoads fan."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"- Yeah, no, he specifically shouted out Randy Rhoads."
01:55:25;01:55:28;"I was like, you like the first Sabbath album and stuff?"
01:55:28;01:55:29;"And he's like, you know what?"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"My wife and I put that on last year and it's just too dark."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"- Whoa."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"- Not a Sabbath guy."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"Osborne, so low material."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"- That's like the TC heads"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"who don't (beep) with Vampire Weekend."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Wait, by the way, I was thinking about this"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"when we were talking about Billie Eilish"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"and how young she is."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"We got a very funny email."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"This is from a young person named Vera."
01:55:50;01:55:53;"- Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"- Subject, Time Crisis."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Dear Jake Longstreth and Ezra Koenig"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"of the internet radio show Time Crisis,"
01:55:59;01:56:00;"my name is Vera."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"I'm a middle school student at an NYC public school."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"I like that she specified public school."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"Gives her more credibility."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"I'm a huge fan of Time Crisis"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"and I've re-listened to all of the episodes multiple times."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"- Wow."
01:56:12;01:56:14;"- Yeah, that would require just years."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"You couldn't be a full-time public school student"
01:56:16;01:56:17;"and pull that off?"
01:56:17;01:56:18;"Well, maybe a lot."
01:56:18;01:56:21;"I've mentioned Time Crisis to many acquaintances of mine"
01:56:21;01:56:22;"and recommend it."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Thank you."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"You know, I don't say this enough,"
01:56:24;01:56:28;"but Time Crisis thrives on word of mouth."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"A few of these acquaintances got back to me"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"and either said it was lame or boring"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"or they didn't get or understand"
01:56:34;01:56:35;"what you were talking about."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"Such topics include the McRib, Seinfeld,"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"and the Grateful Dead."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"Which brings me back to my initial question,"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"what age group is Time Crisis targeted towards?"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"Sincerely, Vera, a fan of the show."
01:56:46;01:56:47;"Is this email fake?"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"What was your guys' gut?"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"- No."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"- What was your blink moment?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- I bought it."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"- You buy that this is a middle schooler?"
01:56:52;01:56:53;"- That didn't even cross my mind that it was fake."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- Yeah."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"- What would be the end game?"
01:56:55;01:56:58;"- Just the part, the part, I'm just saying,"
01:56:58;01:57:01;"such topics include the McRib, Seinfeld,"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"and the Grateful Dead."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"I guess by middle school,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"there's something about the sense of humor"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"that I felt like, no, you're right,"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"I could buy that it's a real middle school student."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"- And I also buy that her friends"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"thought the show was lame and boring."
01:57:12;01:57:13;"- I mean, what are they into?"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"- Fortnite?"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"I don't know."
01:57:15;01:57:18;"- Yeah, Billie Eilish and Fortnite."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"- It's a cool vibe."
01:57:19;01:57:20;"- It's a little bit hard for me to understand"
01:57:20;01:57:22;"what anybody of any age would make of this show"
01:57:22;01:57:25;"if you were just like recommended an episode."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"- Right."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"- I could see that somebody might recommend"
01:57:27;01:57:30;"like one of like the big guest interviews."
01:57:30;01:57:31;"- Right."
01:57:31;01:57:31;"- Like definitely a lot of people brought up"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"the Justin Vernon interview."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"- Yeah."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"- Because that's the type of thing that you're gonna get"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"just like a Boney Vera fan."
01:57:38;01:57:39;"- Well, yeah."
01:57:39;01:57:39;"- Is gonna check it out."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"But even if you were like a fan,"
01:57:41;01:57:42;"if you're like a real TC head"
01:57:42;01:57:43;"and you're trying to get somebody in,"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"you're like, you knew they liked Boney Vera,"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"you might be like, check out that episode."
01:57:46;01:57:48;"Then they listen to the one after."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"- Right."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"- You're probably just be like, what the (beep) is this?"
01:57:50;01:57:51;"- Right."
01:57:51;01:57:51;"- Yeah, I don't know."
01:57:51;01:57:54;"- When they break down Jet versus Tim and Paula,"
01:57:54;01:57:55;"it's so sick."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"- I mean--"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"- Even that's an easier entry point than--"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"- The McRib."
01:58:00;01:58:01;"- Yeah."
01:58:01;01:58:02;"Lonnie's dad."
01:58:02;01:58:04;"- Yeah, if you can't understand"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"why Jake's Lonnie's dad story"
01:58:06;01:58:09;"is one of the greatest stories of all time,"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"you're never gonna get TC."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"- I also feel it's funny 'cause you can't really,"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"you can't be like, you know what?"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"You really gotta start at the beginning."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"- Right, 'cause that would throw people off too"
01:58:17;01:58:21;"because what's the fan consensus, Seinfeld?"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"When does TC really find its voice?"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"- Oh, people say like episodes like 60 or like what?"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"(laughing)"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"No, I've been--"
01:58:29;01:58:30;"- You're serious?"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"- I've been creeping, yeah, people,"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"'cause it was the run,"
01:58:33;01:58:34;"people will often say like the run"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"between like Lonnie's dad and like--"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"(laughing)"
01:58:37;01:58:38;"- It's like a live, it's like a jam."
01:58:38;01:58:42;"- It's about 120 hours worth of tape."
01:58:42;01:58:45;"- They started to figure out what they were doing."
01:58:45;01:58:48;"- Now that we're so deep, are we ready to have"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"like a Talking Dead post show?"
01:58:50;01:58:53;"(laughing)"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"That's just a couple TC heads."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"Yeah, I would say the show really found its voice"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"in that run between Lonnie's dad and I don't know."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"- A Star is Born, probably."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"- I hope earlier than that."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"- Well, there's another fact--"
01:59:05;01:59:06;"- So there's another fact to what you're saying."
01:59:06;01:59:08;"- Some people will also say that like--"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"- We lost our voice then?"
01:59:10;01:59:15;"- No, no, the show, you know, the first few episodes,"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"it was really finding its footing, like--"
01:59:17;01:59:17;"- Oh yeah, of course."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"- The first like five episodes or something,"
01:59:19;01:59:21;"or like trash, just trash."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"(laughing)"
01:59:23;01:59:24;"- Although the first episode,"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"wait, the first episode is Mark Ronson, right?"
01:59:26;01:59:27;"- Yeah, yeah, that's right."
01:59:27;01:59:31;"And isn't Rashida on that episode?"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"- Well, we had Rashida--"
01:59:33;01:59:34;"- A lot more music back then."
01:59:34;01:59:35;"- We had way more music."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"- A lot of Billy Joel."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"- I had to fight tooth and nail"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"against the powers that be."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"I said, you know what, guys?"
01:59:41;01:59:44;"Nobody likes music anymore, trust me."
01:59:44;01:59:45;"I'm a musician, I'm on the front lines."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"Music is over."
01:59:47;01:59:48;"- Music's for squares, man."
01:59:48;01:59:49;"- Music's for squares."
01:59:49;01:59:53;"And they finally let me turn this into what it is,"
01:59:53;01:59:56;"a real internet talk radio show."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"Yeah, we had some of like Rashida's son and some of her,"
01:59:58;02:00:01;"'cause that's when I was really trying to make it"
02:00:01;02:00:02;"like a professional show."
02:00:02;02:00:05;"So I was like, Rashida has all these like amazing stories."
02:00:05;02:00:07;"There's like, oh, she, and they're so short, some of them."
02:00:07;02:00:10;"Like, oh, I went to the prom with Robin Thicke or something."
02:00:10;02:00:12;"You know, bubbles bit me."
02:00:12;02:00:13;"I was like, all right, that could be great."
02:00:13;02:00:15;"Like, you know, just like a real show"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"with like segments and moments and stuff."
02:00:17;02:00:20;"- Yeah, you got Desus and Mero on their first episode."
02:00:20;02:00:20;"- That's right."
02:00:20;02:00:22;"Florence, Gerard was early on."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"- Yeah, Azealia Banks."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"- Oh yeah, shout out to Azealia."
02:00:25;02:00:26;"- I was on that ep."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"- Right."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"- I think it was my first ep."
02:00:28;02:00:32;"- That was a pretty legendary post-show dinner."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"- Yep."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"- Me, you, Azealia, Rashida."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"- Yep."
02:00:36;02:00:37;"- Wow."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"- And I think Seinfeld wasn't on there yet."
02:00:39;02:00:42;"- No, Seinfeld came in, 'cause Seinfeld was still in Canada."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"- That's right."
02:00:43;02:00:44;"- We used to do those post-show dinners."
02:00:44;02:00:45;"- Yeah."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"- We did that like, oh, what was that?"
02:00:46;02:00:47;"- A lot of weird."
02:00:47;02:00:49;"- Six, eight times probably."
02:00:49;02:00:50;"- Wow."
02:00:50;02:00:51;"- Well, I think also because back then, Jake,"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"you were still kind of like a guest."
02:00:53;02:00:54;"- Yeah."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"- So you weren't an official part of the structure."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"- Right."
02:00:57;02:00:59;"- You know, so I kind of felt like Jake's being nice"
02:00:59;02:01:00;"by being a guest on the show,"
02:01:00;02:01:01;"should take him out to dinner."
02:01:01;02:01:03;"- Very sweet of you."
02:01:03;02:01:04;"- We had some good dinners."
02:01:04;02:01:06;"- Did you guys go to dinner with JB Fox?"
02:01:07;02:01:08;"- No, he had to leave."
02:01:08;02:01:09;"- Okay."
02:01:09;02:01:12;"- I mean, I invited him personally to stick around"
02:01:12;02:01:13;"and have dinner with us."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"- I mean, he's core Crisis crew."
02:01:15;02:01:18;"I don't know why he would have bailed."
02:01:18;02:01:19;"- Maybe we gotta get Jamie back on the program."
02:01:19;02:01:20;"- Yeah."
02:01:20;02:01:23;"- Anyway, it's no surprise what the number one"
02:01:23;02:01:24;"most streamed song of the year is."
02:01:24;02:01:26;"- Wait, let me guess."
02:01:26;02:01:27;"(beep)"
02:01:27;02:01:28;"I can't guess."
02:01:28;02:01:29;"(laughing)"
02:01:29;02:01:30;"You know what it is."
02:01:30;02:01:31;"- You know what it is."
02:01:31;02:01:32;"- In your heart."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"Man or woman?"
02:01:33;02:01:36;"- I believe this person identifies as a man."
02:01:37;02:01:39;"(buzzing)"
02:01:39;02:01:39;"- Can I give you a hint?"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"- Actually, it's two men."
02:01:41;02:01:42;"- Give me a hint."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"- One, yeah, it's two men."
02:01:44;02:01:45;"- Two men?"
02:01:45;02:01:46;"- Album of the year nominee."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"- An album of the year nominee,"
02:01:47;02:01:52;"but kind of a little shorter than most albums, but."
02:01:52;02:01:55;"- Oh, oh, oh, Old Town Road."
02:01:55;02:01:56;"- Old Town Road."
02:01:56;02:01:59;"Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus."
02:01:59;02:02:00;"- Right."
02:02:00;02:02:03;"God, this is random."
02:02:03;02:02:04;"- You know."
02:02:04;02:02:05;"- This is the number one song."
02:02:05;02:02:08;"- The two albums from Columbia Records"
02:02:08;02:02:11;"that are up for album of the year, Vampire and Lil Nas X."
02:02:11;02:02:12;"- That's tight."
02:02:12;02:02:16;"♪ I'm gonna ride till I can't no more ♪"
02:02:16;02:02:20;"♪ Gonna take my horse to the old town road ♪"
02:02:20;02:02:23;"♪ I'm gonna ride till I can't no more ♪"
02:02:23;02:02:26;"♪ I got the horses in the back ♪"
02:02:26;02:02:27;"♪ Horse tack is attached ♪"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"♪ Hat is matted black ♪"
02:02:29;02:02:30;"- Everybody loves Lil Nas X."
02:02:30;02:02:34;"I was sad to see he was tweeting about,"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"what did he tweet, Seinfeld?"
02:02:36;02:02:37;"- He was just saying like Vampire Weekend"
02:02:37;02:02:40;"just like needs to step it up."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"All this stuff, no, I don't know."
02:02:41;02:02:43;"- He said he has so much respect"
02:02:43;02:02:46;"for all of his fellow nominees except for Vampire Weekend."
02:02:46;02:02:48;"- That he's depressed and that he can get down."
02:02:48;02:02:52;"I think it was probably sort of in response to Juice WRLD."
02:02:52;02:02:56;"- Oh yeah, RIP Juice WRLD, man."
02:02:56;02:02:58;"- He said, ""I like to pretend hate and (beep)"
02:02:58;02:03:01;"don't get to me, but subconsciously it eats away at me."
02:03:01;02:03:03;"Feeling like you have the world"
02:03:03;02:03:07;"and knowing it can all go away at any time is scary."
02:03:07;02:03:08;"With all this being said, I don't want anybody"
02:03:08;02:03:12;"who cared enough to read this to just live in the moment."
02:03:12;02:03:13;"Love you guys."""
02:03:13;02:03:16;"Oh, I want everybody to live in the moment."
02:03:16;02:03:18;"And then he followed it up."
02:03:18;02:03:21;"""Usually I deal with my sad times in private"
02:03:21;02:03:23;"because I don't like for my fans or family"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"to feel sorry for me."
02:03:25;02:03:29;"This year had a lot of very high ups and extremely low downs."
02:03:29;02:03:31;"When you get that hotel room and it's just you,"
02:03:31;02:03:32;"you do a lot of thinking."
02:03:32;02:03:35;"Small things become so big."""
02:03:35;02:03:36;"Wow."
02:03:36;02:03:38;"- I mean, it's not hard to imagine."
02:03:38;02:03:39;"It is funny."
02:03:39;02:03:42;"It's one of those things that the world will never believe."
02:03:42;02:03:43;"I think we've talked about this before,"
02:03:43;02:03:47;"the common theme, like going back to the Eagles and before,"
02:03:47;02:03:49;"even ""A Star is Born,"""
02:03:49;02:03:50;"going back to the original ""A Star is Born,"""
02:03:50;02:03:52;"the '20s or '30s or whatever,"
02:03:52;02:03:56;"this theme that fame, this coveted thing,"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"almost invariably brings some type of misery."
02:03:59;02:04:02;"And yet Don Henley can make his best case"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"to try to help people understand"
02:04:04;02:04:06;"that fame can be like a prison."
02:04:06;02:04:11;"And yet every generation, it's kind of like a blank slate."
02:04:11;02:04:13;"You gotta learn these lessons yourself."
02:04:13;02:04:16;"And I'm sure there's more to the story"
02:04:16;02:04:18;"of what he's saying, these extremely low points,"
02:04:18;02:04:22;"but at least one thing he's saying is that all his success"
02:04:22;02:04:25;"has brought anxiety of not being successful in the future."
02:04:25;02:04:27;"That's some real (beep)"
02:04:27;02:04:29;"You get used to being successful"
02:04:29;02:04:32;"and having fans and things like that."
02:04:32;02:04:33;"It's not that easy to say, ""Well, it's great."
02:04:33;02:04:34;"""I had that for a minute."""
02:04:34;02:04:36;"Some people never have that."
02:04:36;02:04:38;"Now let me just go back to--"
02:04:38;02:04:39;"- Being me."
02:04:39;02:04:41;"- Being me riding horses."
02:04:41;02:04:42;"But you know what, that's the (beep) up thing."
02:04:42;02:04:44;"It's very Fitzgeraldian."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"You can't go back to the old town road."
02:04:46;02:04:47;"You're in the new town now."
02:04:47;02:04:50;"And you know what's also (beep) up is like,"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"I wonder if one of the reasons that seeing somebody"
02:04:52;02:04:55;"like Lil Nas X say that is very affecting to people."
02:04:55;02:04:57;"And this is at least one thing that crossed my mind"
02:04:57;02:04:58;"as an artist."
02:04:58;02:05:00;"You look at somebody like Lil Nas X,"
02:05:00;02:05:02;"somebody who can create literally the most streamed song"
02:05:02;02:05:05;"of the whole year, the biggest song."
02:05:05;02:05:08;"And it's half a joke song."
02:05:08;02:05:09;"It's like, literally, he's not a cowboy."
02:05:09;02:05:11;"He had this song."
02:05:11;02:05:12;"It has a kind of serious tone,"
02:05:12;02:05:14;"but he's somebody who started out basically being"
02:05:14;02:05:18;"a Twitter comedian slash tweet decker or whatever."
02:05:18;02:05:22;"It's almost like Pagliacci or something where it's like,"
02:05:22;02:05:24;"there's some people who their music"
02:05:24;02:05:25;"and their public image,"
02:05:25;02:05:28;"I think it's also why I don't wanna go too extreme,"
02:05:28;02:05:29;"but you know, make you think about Rob Williams"
02:05:29;02:05:30;"or something."
02:05:30;02:05:34;"When there's people who's everything about their public"
02:05:34;02:05:37;"persona and their art is about life is pain and suffering."
02:05:37;02:05:41;"And sometimes part of why we love to see like a funny person"
02:05:41;02:05:43;"win or somebody who makes a song that wasn't even supposed"
02:05:43;02:05:45;"to be a hit single."
02:05:45;02:05:48;"It's so pleasant because it's almost like they're disconnected"
02:05:48;02:05:50;"from this brutal competitive world we live in."
02:05:50;02:05:52;"They remind us that life's not that serious"
02:05:52;02:05:54;"and you can have a laugh."
02:05:54;02:05:56;"And this like random song about horses,"
02:05:56;02:05:57;"let's get Billy Ray Cyrus."
02:05:57;02:05:58;"And now it's the biggest song."
02:05:58;02:06:01;"In some ways, that's a more life affirming thing"
02:06:01;02:06:04;"than when like some intense ballad goes to number one."
02:06:04;02:06:05;"Like it rules."
02:06:05;02:06:08;"It rules that like a young kid made a joke song"
02:06:08;02:06:10;"and it like kind of changed culture."
02:06:10;02:06:14;"And you also hope that because the song has a lightness"
02:06:14;02:06:16;"about it, you would hope that the person does too,"
02:06:16;02:06:19;"that they'd be a little more immune to some of this stuff."
02:06:19;02:06:21;"But then he's keeping it real talking about these things."
02:06:21;02:06:23;"And it reminds you, even the person who made"
02:06:23;02:06:26;"the fun novelty song, they get weighed down"
02:06:26;02:06:31;"by the same anxieties that a Tom York or something would be."
02:06:31;02:06:35;"Everybody's worried about what's gonna happen to me tomorrow."
02:06:35;02:06:36;"Will the things that feel good in my life now"
02:06:36;02:06:38;"still feel good in the future?"
02:06:38;02:06:40;"Can I feel comfortable?"
02:06:40;02:06:41;"Am I isolated or alone?"
02:06:41;02:06:44;"You know, he's talking about being alone in the hotel room."
02:06:44;02:06:47;"So anyway, the one thing we can say is that these feelings"
02:06:47;02:06:48;"are somewhat universal."
02:06:48;02:06:51;"Different people have different ways of dealing with them,"
02:06:51;02:06:54;"but it's kind of amazing how universal feelings"
02:06:54;02:06:57;"of isolation and anxiety are across industries"
02:06:57;02:06:59;"and certainly within industries."
02:06:59;02:07:04;"So, you know, ending 2019 on a somewhat darker note, but."
02:07:04;02:07:06;"- You wanna end on a slightly more positive note?"
02:07:06;02:07:08;"- Yeah."
02:07:08;02:07:11;"- We can take a listen to our friend Patrick World,"
02:07:11;02:07:14;"who gave us a TC year in review."
02:07:14;02:07:16;"- Okay, this is perfect."
02:07:16;02:07:19;"And also keep your eyes peeled, Time Crisis 2000,"
02:07:19;02:07:23;"because we're gonna be giving away all sorts of T-shirts"
02:07:23;02:07:26;"that we've amassed over the years."
02:07:26;02:07:28;"Some that we made, a lot of bootleg stuff"
02:07:28;02:07:29;"that's been sent our way."
02:07:29;02:07:31;"And we wanna give back to the community."
02:07:31;02:07:35;"And Seinfeld, this is actually a real number crunch,"
02:07:35;02:07:39;"because when I deputized you to create and sell"
02:07:39;02:07:43;"the popcorn raisin shirts, I was very specific"
02:07:43;02:07:46;"about the fact that the proceeds from these sales,"
02:07:46;02:07:50;"the money that we got from the deep fat pocketed"
02:07:50;02:07:53;"meat eater fans would be turned around and sent"
02:07:53;02:07:56;"to the broke vegan TC heads."
02:07:56;02:07:59;"People who help the world by not eating meat,"
02:07:59;02:08:03;"but don't have the money or the resources"
02:08:03;02:08:05;"to do it in a way that's easy."
02:08:05;02:08:10;"So I'm almost scared to ask, because for all I know,"
02:08:10;02:08:12;"and during the fall of Seinfeld,"
02:08:12;02:08:14;"you've lost your moral compass."
02:08:14;02:08:16;"And for all I know, the money's gone."
02:08:16;02:08:19;"Please tell me this money has made it to the broke vegans."
02:08:19;02:08:22;"- When that directive went out, Ezra, I took it seriously."
02:08:22;02:08:26;"I took a solemn pledge to make sure that those broke vegans"
02:08:26;02:08:29;"were supported by some ethical merch"
02:08:29;02:08:32;"that also itself supports a great cause,"
02:08:32;02:08:34;"which is the awareness of popcorn and raisins"
02:08:34;02:08:38;"is a delicious combination of two beloved snack foods."
02:08:38;02:08:43;"And what I will say is that we were able to generate"
02:08:43;02:08:48;"$1,511.71 in profits."
02:08:48;02:08:48;"- In profits?"
02:08:48;02:08:49;"- Correct."
02:08:49;02:08:50;"- Wow."
02:08:50;02:08:54;"- So once you divide that by the 25 broke vegans"
02:08:54;02:08:59;"who have emailed us, each with their own very specific case,"
02:08:59;02:09:02;"they are each left with $60.46,"
02:09:02;02:09:07;"which will be disseminated among them via PayPal,"
02:09:07;02:09:10;"because I'm Canadian, I'm not really up on Venmo."
02:09:10;02:09:14;"And that'll all be dispersed before the end of the year."
02:09:14;02:09:16;"- 60 bucks a head, that's no joke."
02:09:16;02:09:17;"- Yeah."
02:09:17;02:09:19;"- Especially come around Christmas time,"
02:09:19;02:09:21;"people gotta buy stocking stuffers"
02:09:21;02:09:22;"and things of that nature."
02:09:22;02:09:24;"People gotta tighten their belts a little bit."
02:09:24;02:09:27;"$60 is a tidy sum."
02:09:27;02:09:28;"So I'm glad that's all going out"
02:09:28;02:09:29;"to the broke vegan community."
02:09:29;02:09:31;"And I wanna personally thank--"
02:09:31;02:09:33;"- You're welcome."
02:09:33;02:09:34;"I mean, I--"
02:09:34;02:09:38;"- All the people who bought the popcorn and raisins shirts."
02:09:38;02:09:40;"- Sure, and just the whole--"
02:09:40;02:09:42;"- And by the way, Seinfeld, please forward me"
02:09:42;02:09:44;"the Excel spreadsheet."
02:09:44;02:09:46;"I need to double check those numbers."
02:09:46;02:09:48;"- Well, I would never abscond with the bread,"
02:09:48;02:09:52;"and I will gladly send you those numbers."
02:09:52;02:09:54;"Probably the most important number crunch"
02:09:54;02:09:56;"I've done this year."
02:09:56;02:09:58;"So, you know, shout out to myself"
02:09:58;02:10:02;"as far as my own involvement in all of this."
02:10:02;02:10:03;"- Big money."
02:10:03;02:10:04;"- Let's do this Patrick World song."
02:10:04;02:10:05;"- All right."
02:10:05;02:10:06;"- Signing off."
02:10:06;02:10:08;"- Signing off for 2019."
02:10:08;02:10:10;"This is the Crisis Crew."
02:10:10;02:10:11;"Thanks to everybody for listening."
02:10:11;02:10:13;"We'll be back real soon."
02:10:13;02:10:16;"2020 is gonna be the biggest and best year"
02:10:16;02:10:18;"for the TC community yet."
02:10:18;02:10:19;"I guarantee it."
02:10:19;02:10:23;"We're gonna continue with all the great TC segments"
02:10:23;02:10:26;"that you love, whether it's top five"
02:10:26;02:10:28;"or talking about classic rock."
02:10:28;02:10:29;"We're definitely gonna be continuing"
02:10:29;02:10:32;"the fall of Seinfeld narrative arc,"
02:10:32;02:10:35;"which has just been getting rave reviews"
02:10:35;02:10:36;"across the media sphere."
02:10:36;02:10:39;"Have a safe and pleasant holiday season."
