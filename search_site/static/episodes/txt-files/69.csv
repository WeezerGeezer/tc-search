00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, episode 69 if you can believe it. I'm here with Jake and this"
00:07;00:14;"is a very special show as we have a guest calling in a legend. That's right"
00:14;00:21;"Alanis Morissette. We'll also be talking about Tic Tacs a little more, the Richard"
00:21;00:26;"Pictures Vampire Weekend shows in Ojai and counting down the hits of 1974. This"
00:26;00:32;"is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:34;02:39;"I don't know what the practicality of the acoustic bass is really. I mean I guess"
02:39;02:44;"you want to do some it's got a different kind of sound every time I pick up a"
02:44;02:50;"bass I always play the same songs like. Give it away?"
02:53;02:59;"Is that Rage? Yeah, bomb track. Oh the intro to Bomb Track. It'd be better with a pick. And then"
03:10;03:17;"This is like two dudes in like their bedroom in high school."
03:21;03:25;"90s bedroom and the other one it's all like 90s so the other one I always play"
03:32;03:36;"Look out! Wait what is that? I don't know what that is. It's another one of the black rockin beats."
03:36;03:40;"It's like a Chemical Brothers song. Oh man."
03:45;03:50;"Do you know any Chili's dude? On bass? Yeah dude like some sick Fleet Parts."
03:57;03:59;"I don't know how to do funk but."
04:08;04:15;"This is a major show we got today. Yeah, packed. This is a packed show. You know normally when we do this show"
04:15;04:19;"we always like barely even talk about what's gonna happen. Maybe you know in the intro but we don't"
04:19;04:24;"talk about it here but today we got a big guest calling in. Yep. Alanis Morissette."
04:24;04:29;"Finally getting her on the horn. Makes sense. She's been coming up a lot lately. Oh yeah."
04:29;04:34;"She's definitely in the zeitgeist. She got some shows coming up. She got a musical. We're gonna talk about that with her."
04:34;04:40;"But before that, Jake you actually dropped some of your own musical stylings recently."
04:40;04:45;"I did man. Wrote it today. Oh that was today? Yeah. Wow. Woke up really inspired."
04:45;04:51;"Was thinking about that Sweet Chili Heat refrain from last show. And I just had it in my head."
04:51;04:55;"So you turned it into a proper song. Poured a cup of coffee, grabbed the guitar and"
04:55;05:02;"panned an instant classic. So for people who don't remember, I actually don't even remember."
05:02;05:10;"Sweet Chili Heat was the Canadian version. That's the Canadian version of Spicy Sweet Chili."
05:10;05:16;"Chili? Spicy Sweet Chili. Which in the verse of the song I reference. Oh and to clarify we're talking about Doritos."
05:16;05:21;"Oh yeah. Which we are not sponsored by. People sometimes find it hard to believe that on time crisis"
05:21;05:26;"we're not sponsored. But you know what? That's how crass the world has become. Anytime"
05:26;05:32;"somebody shouts something out just cause they like it. Right. People say, what are you sponsored by them?"
05:32;05:37;"You gotta say that it's an ad if you're sponsored. I just wanted to write a song about Doritos."
05:37;05:43;"Sometimes you just like stuff people. Or just want to talk about it. By the way, we keep it real on this show."
05:43;05:50;"We don't always toe the Frito-Lay corporate line. Not at all. Yeah in fact Fritos suck."
05:50;05:58;"Lays are okay but Fritos suck. I like Frito Pie maybe but just like Fritos? I don't want to eat that."
05:58;06:01;"That's bottom of the barrel."
06:05;06:09;"You should just hold that bass the whole show. I might hold the bass the whole time."
06:09;06:15;"Maybe just do some interludes here and there. Can you play any like Seinfeld style?"
06:15;06:20;"Bam ba bam bam bam. Bea was playing that the other day at the rehearsal. He can actually play it. That's tight."
07:03;07:09;"Yeah so anyway we're not sponsored by Frito-Lay. Fritos suck but we do take an interest in these types of things."
07:09;07:16;"We're not even being complimentary about Doritos. In fact I think it's confusing that they give two different names to the same chip in America and Canada."
07:16;07:23;"But anyway we were talking about that how in Canada there's a Dorito called Sweet Chili Heat and that's what inspired you to write this song."
07:23;07:28;"Yeah well last episode I just kept like singing just Sweet Chili Heat. It just sounded like a song to me."
07:28;07:32;"Let's listen to it man. Let's listen to it. This is exciting. This is a world premiere. Yeah."
07:32;07:35;"So we got to use our world premiere ID."
07:46;07:50;"So now this is becoming a real thing. Oh this is the second straight episode with a world premiere."
07:50;07:54;"Yeah so this is the second straight episode with a world premiere. Time Crisis is getting pretty spicy over here."
07:54;07:58;"So again the last episode we premiered Beyo's Sting and Shaggy remix. Yep."
07:58;08:04;"And this one even more on brand our Sweet Chili Heat world premiere is a song called Sweet Chili."
08:04;08:06;"Let's listen to that intro one more time."
08:08;08:16;"Time Crisis. This is the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat. Sweet Chili Heat world premiere brought to you by Doritos Sweet Chili Heat."
08:16;08:23;"Oh man. That's good. Maybe now we should have more world premieres on this show. I think so."
08:23;08:30;"I'll even say this. If you write a song. Let's try to keep them short. Maybe 45 seconds to a minute and a half."
08:30;08:37;"If you write a song that's about a time crisis type of thing. We'll give you a world premiere. We'll give you a Doritos Sweet Chili Heat."
08:37;08:45;"Yeah because this song I wrote this morning is definitely. This is about time crisis culture and the time slot. Right."
08:45;08:51;"Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the way it should be. This is the first entry into that field."
08:51;08:56;"Okay great. So here is the world premiere of Jake Longstrap with Sweet Chili Heat."
09:01;09:14;"It's a sweet sweet sweet chili heat. Oh yeah. Have one on me. It's a sweet sweet chili heat."
09:14;09:31;"12 noon on a Sunday Pacific Standard Time. It's three o'clock in the afternoon in the Maritimes."
09:31;09:48;"Grab a cold one. Crack it fun. Maybe Medello. Maybe we could. Crack a bag of that spicy sweet chili."
09:48;10:04;"Oh yeah. Have one on me. It's a sweet sweet sweet chili heat. Alright. Oh yeah. Have one on me. It's a sweet sweet chili heat."
10:04;10:13;"It's a sweet sweet chili heat. Love it. Clocking in at a lean minute 17. Oh hell yeah."
10:13;10:25;"It's a sweet sweet sweet chili heat. I feel like a band of good musicians could make that sound like the Eagles."
10:25;10:30;"That's what I was going for. I would love to hear that with like a lion eyes aesthetic."
10:30;10:35;"You know what that's not kind of it sounds like big star to me too. Oh yeah I can hear that."
10:35;10:40;"I would say a little more big star. I think like the vocal voice sounds great on it by the way."
10:40;10:44;"Thanks man. The vocal has a little bit of that Alex Chilton. Yeah I can hear that."
10:44;10:55;"Like a more slightly 70s early power pop. Oh yeah. Have one on me. It's a sweet sweet chili heat."
10:55;11:02;"September girls. This so much. Oh yeah. Have one on me."
11:02;11:12;"So in that song I like that it was kind of a nuanced allusion to time crisis. You didn't drop the name but you with the time zone stuff."
11:12;11:17;"Right. Is the narrator of the song encouraging somebody else to listen to the show."
11:17;11:23;"Oh here we go. This is your logic. This is your song logic. Who's singing? Is it you Jake? Yeah."
11:23;11:27;"Co-host of time crisis. Well no I don't know who's singing. Fair enough."
11:27;11:32;"You know what I mean. Do you have a established perspective for every song you sing?"
11:32;11:38;"Or is it all sort of vaguely first person? I have five characters. There's one called Ezra that doesn't mean it's me."
11:38;11:42;"Then there's Sasha Fierce Koenig. That's for like the harder stuff."
11:42;11:50;"I don't think this is me. I think this is a friend singing a song to his friend of just like dude let's crack a brew."
11:50;11:56;"Let's crack a bag of sweet chili heat. Throw on the show. Chill out. Nice."
11:56;12:01;"That's what it is. It's not me. At home? Yeah I guess. I don't know."
12:01;12:08;"We talk a lot about like who's listening to time crisis and where. I think you know probably a lot of people just solo earbuds in."
12:08;12:14;"Right. On the bus. Driving. Maybe their job involves driving. Maybe they're doing deliveries or something."
12:14;12:19;"Been there. Yeah maybe it's like a young Jake Longstreth delivering for Papa John's."
12:19;12:25;"Run and Zah. Run and Zah in Portland. We got a young Jake Longstreth just taking in some time crisis."
12:25;12:30;"We've always been interested in the communal aspect because obviously this show is about community and bringing people together."
12:30;12:34;"So we've gotten a lot of nice emails from like couples who listen together. Right."
12:34;12:40;"They like go for a drive on a Sunday. Especially like Sundays are a classic kind of like couple day. Right."
12:40;12:45;"So if you're coupled up. Throw on that TC. Throw on that TC. Yeah because I think there's an expectation."
12:45;12:52;"Like we're promoting our own show on the show. So lame."
12:52;13:00;"That's the sequel to Sweet Chili Eat. It's just. Have one on me. It's a Sunday. Listen to TC."
13:00;13:02;"Yeah that's verse two. How about like a couple."
13:02;13:06;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
13:06;13:20;"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay. Against your skin so brown."
13:20;13:26;"And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight."
13:26;13:32;"With a billion stars all around."
13:32;13:40;"Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling."
13:40;13:46;"And I know you won't let me down."
13:46;14:00;"Cause I'm already standing on the ground."
14:00;14:06;"And I found out a long time ago."
14:06;14:14;"What a woman can do to your soul."
14:14;14:20;"But she can't take you anyway."
14:20;14:26;"You don't already know how to go."
14:26;14:34;"And I got a peaceful easy feeling."
14:34;14:40;"And I know you won't let me down."
14:40;14:48;"Cause I'm already standing on the ground."
14:48;14:56;"My wife Hannah was saying that her manager Ben drove out to Palm Springs and back last weekend and listened to TC both ways."
14:56;14:58;"Both ways? Nice. So two full eps probably."
14:58;15:05;"Hell yeah. When we visualized our listeners and we've talked about the communal aspect we've often visualized couples."
15:05;15:07;"Cause Sundays is a very couple-y day."
15:07;15:13;"If you're coupled up Sundays there's an expectation that you're going to be with your significant other."
15:13;15:17;"Whether it's brunch, if you're a heathen, or church, if you're religious."
15:17;15:20;"Or even just having a lazy Sunday in bed."
15:20;15:22;"Doing laundry at home."
15:22;15:24;"Just doing some chores."
15:24;15:27;"Cooking a pot of chili."
15:27;15:33;"Chili Sundays. But I also want to say that not everybody in the world is coupled up."
15:33;15:38;"We do live in a very couple-centric society."
15:38;15:44;"As people have rightly pointed out from time to time, that's not the only valid or important relationship in life."
15:44;15:47;"So in this song, it could be a couple."
15:47;15:52;"But I also like the idea, and I don't know if this happens, if there's ever just a couple of bros."
15:52;15:54;"Or just any type of friends."
15:54;15:57;"Who are just getting together. Maybe they're both single."
15:57;16:00;"Maybe they're not interested in a relationship at this point in their life."
16:00;16:03;"Their Sunday's wide open. But they still love TC."
16:03;16:06;"And they may love the communal aspect of it. So maybe they do just get together."
16:06;16:10;"Maybe that Saturday night late text. ""Hey man, your place or mine?"""
16:10;16:13;"For TC."
16:13;16:17;"""How about your place? My roommate's got his cousin staying in town."""
16:17;16:20;"""Alright, cool man. Grab a couple bags of sweet chili heat."""
16:20;16:24;"""You know it. Then just sit down on the couch and play it off an iPhone."""
16:24;16:27;"Just sitting there in silence."
16:27;16:31;"Those are just a little too quiet for two people to listen to in the house."
16:31;16:33;"Maybe play it through the speakers."
16:33;16:37;"Maybe the song is also just about prepping for a football game too."
16:37;16:41;"Like your friends are coming over. ""Have one on me dude."""
16:41;16:44;"""Crack that bag of sweet chili heat."""
16:44;16:48;"Yeah, because if you were throwing a football watching event."
16:48;16:51;"And you saw, ""What was that? Have one on me."""
16:51;16:54;"Does that mean a whole bag or just one chip?"
16:54;16:57;"In my head, there's some logic jumps."
16:57;17:01;"It's ""Have a brew on me."" But then we're talking about chips."
17:01;17:04;"Maybe it's ""Have one single serving bag on me."""
17:04;17:09;"I thought it was almost like you roll over for the football game party."
17:09;17:12;"""Have one on me dude."" Full size family bag."
17:12;17:16;"And you're just poking around in the kitchen. You see this bag of sweet chili heat."
17:16;17:21;"And maybe there's just some Fritos and Lay's laid out in the living room."
17:21;17:24;"And then you're like, ""Hey man, what's up with these sweet chili heat?"""
17:24;17:27;"And you're like, ""Oh, actually those are mine for the week."""
17:27;17:30;"But... [laughter]"
17:30;17:33;"Those are not part of the party? Those are mine for the week?"
17:33;17:35;"Oh, okay. I should put those away."
17:35;17:37;"But you know... [laughter]"
17:37;17:39;"Everyone's going to get really confused."
17:39;17:43;"No, but then maybe it's like, ""You know what man, have one on me."""
17:43;17:46;"I could have one sweet chili heat chip? Yes."
17:46;17:49;"Oh, have one on me. One chip."
17:49;18:04;"[singing]"
18:04;18:06;"I could picture it as an Eagles song too though."
18:06;18:08;"Yeah, like with really thick harmonies."
18:08;18:11;"[singing]"
18:11;18:15;"Great song, and I hope it's the first of many from you and from any listeners."
18:15;18:16;"Fan base."
18:16;18:24;"Fan base, because if you send us a song, you could be our Doritos Sweet Chili Heat world premiere."
18:34;18:42;"[singing]"
18:42;18:45;"Oh, I got nothing. [laughter]"
18:45;18:49;"I was trying to write from the perspective of the guy who found the sweet chili heat in the kitchen."
18:52;18:55;"Very specific perspectives."
18:55;19:00;"Okay, this song is about a guy that goes to his friend's house,"
19:00;19:05;"sees a bunch of Doritos laid out, and then is told he can't have any."
19:05;19:10;"What's up Kansas City? This next one's about... [laughter]"
19:10;19:13;"There's some hard truths in this one."
19:13;19:16;"This next one's about a guy who goes to a party at his friend's house."
19:16;19:22;"He spies a bag of chips, but it's not in the designated party snack area."
19:50;19:56;"Running in that deep, running blind."
19:56;20:03;"Running into the sun, but I'm rolling behind."
20:03;20:10;"Gotta do what you can just to keep your mother alive."
20:10;20:17;"Trying not to confuse anything that you do with just your life."
20:17;20:24;"At 69 I was 21, and I called the love of my own."
20:24;20:30;"I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on."
20:30;20:38;"Running in that deep, running blind."
20:38;20:41;"Running into the sun, but I'm rolling behind."
20:41;20:44;"Okay man, I think it's time to get Lanis Morissette on the horn."
20:44;20:48;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
20:48;20:51;"[phone ringing]"
20:51;20:55;"Hello? Hello? How you doing man? I'm good, how are you? Not bad."
20:55;20:59;"We're just wrapping up a meeting and we're going to head up into conference room."
20:59;21:01;"Can I just put you on hold? Yeah. Sweet, thank you."
21:08;21:17;"Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat."
21:17;21:27;"Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat. Sweet, sweet, sweet chili heat."
21:27;21:31;"Born inside a nation, none of myself and a cup of ambition."
21:31;21:35;"And the sweet chili heat on all my fingertips."
21:35;21:40;"Woke up in the morning, inside a bed, I see the chili heat in the kitchen."
21:40;21:44;"I want a little bit of me."
21:44;21:51;"Is it sweet chili heat? Am I waiting a little bit in the sweet chili heat?"
21:51;21:53;"What am I--"
21:53;21:56;"This is all about the guy."
21:56;22:01;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found inside the kitchen?"
22:01;22:05;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen?"
22:05;22:10;"Sweet chili heat that I'm on a meditation?"
22:29;22:33;"Woke up in the morning in my kitchen, and myself a cup of ambition."
22:33;22:38;"And the sweet chili heat."
22:38;22:40;"Went over to Jake's house in the morning."
22:46;22:51;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen?"
22:51;22:55;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found in my friend's kitchen?"
22:55;23:00;"Is that sweet chili heat that I'm on a meditation?"
23:07;23:12;"It's a little hard to fully come up with it on the fly, but I guess--"
23:12;23:13;"Oh, you know what would make sense?"
23:13;23:19;"Because if the part two of the song is a kind of nine to five homage,"
23:19;23:23;"it could make sense that you find a bag of sweet chili heat in the office kitchen,"
23:23;23:25;"and nobody's name is on it."
23:25;23:29;"Then you wail on it, and then--"
23:29;23:30;"And then an email goes out."
23:30;23:31;"Yep."
23:31;23:32;"Who ate--"
23:32;23:33;"Repercussions."
23:33;23:36;"Yeah."
23:36;23:40;"Woke up in the morning in the meditation, pour myself a cup of--"
23:40;23:44;"That's the only line I know from it, pour myself a cup of ambition."
23:44;23:51;"Pour myself a cup of ambition, and I went on and go to work."
23:51;23:56;"I was getting breakfast, and I was really hungry, and I got to the office."
23:56;24:00;"I saw a bag of sweet chili heat."
24:00;24:06;"Is that sweet chili heat that I found in the office kitchen?"
24:06;24:11;"Crush that bag."
24:11;24:12;"Crush that bag."
24:12;24:22;"[humming]"
24:22;24:24;"Second verse."
24:24;24:28;"In the medicine in the morning, got an email from the HR department saying,"
24:28;24:34;"""Who ate that bag of sweet chili heat?"""
24:34;24:37;"Sort of felt bad, but really I didn't."
24:40;24:43;"No one's name was on that bag, and then I--"
24:43;24:46;"Crush that bag of sweet chili heat."
24:46;24:51;"Got that sweet chili bag, and then I found 'em in the kitchen."
24:51;24:58;"Then I crushed that bag in the morning, and then I crushed that bag."
24:58;25:00;"[humming]"
25:00;25:02;"These ads are really cheap."
25:02;25:05;"I go crazy if you let 'em."
25:05;25:08;"I'm not."
25:08;25:10;"I'm just having fun over there."
25:10;25:13;"We were just writing a song while we were waiting."
25:13;25:15;"I'm all right, so we're all set whenever you are."
25:15;25:16;"Great, yeah, you can just throw it on."
25:16;25:18;"They're listening for like five minutes."
25:18;25:22;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
25:22;25:25;"[phone ringing]"
25:25;25:26;"Hi."
25:26;25:27;"Hello."
25:27;25:28;"Hello, it's Alanis."
25:28;25:29;"Hey, Alanis, welcome to the show."
25:29;25:31;"This is Ezra and Jake."
25:31;25:32;"Hey."
25:32;25:33;"Hi, Ezra. Hi, Jake."
25:33;25:35;"First of all, it's an honor to have you on the show."
25:35;25:36;"Massive fans."
25:36;25:37;"Thank you for having me."
25:37;25:39;"We also want to say happy birthday."
25:39;25:40;"Ah."
25:40;25:42;"We're very excited to hear about the musical"
25:42;25:46;"because we've recently just been kind of revisiting that album"
25:46;25:49;"and thinking about the impact it had."
25:49;25:51;"Can you tell us a little bit about the musical?"
25:51;25:53;"That's kind of what you're working on right now, right?"
25:53;25:54;"Yeah, we had the opening."
25:54;25:58;"We had previews for a while in Cambridge at ART, the repertory,"
25:58;26:02;"and then the opening was the 24th."
26:02;26:03;"It was really exciting."
26:03;26:05;"It's perfectly honest."
26:05;26:08;"I've known Thomas Hitchcock since he's been in the makings"
26:08;26:10;"for about eight years."
26:10;26:14;"And so it having come to fruition even at this point"
26:14;26:18;"and with the people, so Diablo Cody writing the book"
26:18;26:22;"and Diane Paulus directing it and Larbi choreographing it"
26:22;26:26;"and just the whole team and the cast and the producers"
26:26;26:29;"and everybody, it's a very surreal experience for me."
26:29;26:31;"My mouth is agape."
26:31;26:34;"Is every song from Jagged Little Pill in it?"
26:34;26:36;"Every song in Jagged Little Pill is in it,"
26:36;26:38;"and then some songs that I've written over the years"
26:38;26:41;"and then two new ones and then some lyrics from some new ones"
26:41;26:42;"for a new record I'm writing now."
26:42;26:43;"Oh, sick."
26:43;26:46;"And so we saw a little--we haven't gotten to see the show yet."
26:46;26:49;"I would love to, but saw one little detail that we're interested in."
26:49;26:51;"The musical takes place in Connecticut?"
26:51;26:52;"Yep."
26:52;26:54;"Jake is from Connecticut, and we've often talked about"
26:54;26:58;"how Connecticut is sometimes unfairly or fairly derided"
26:58;27:00;"as a random state."
27:00;27:05;"And so we were kind of excited to see Connecticut get a little shine."
27:05;27:06;"What's the story with that?"
27:06;27:09;"I didn't write the book, so it's with Diablo Cody."
27:09;27:11;"I call her Brooke, by the way, so if you hear me say Brooke,"
27:11;27:13;"I call her by her real name."
27:13;27:15;"She came up with the Connecticut thing,"
27:15;27:17;"and we basically brainstormed in Malibu."
27:17;27:20;"I have an office that overlooks the ocean,"
27:20;27:23;"and we just brainstormed for 48 hours straight on the whiteboard"
27:23;27:27;"and just bandied ideas around and went down certain rabbit holes"
27:27;27:29;"and trajectories of where characters could go,"
27:29;27:31;"where we specifically didn't want them to go."
27:31;27:33;"It was pretty harrowing and beautiful."
27:33;27:38;"It was one of those cases of two plus two people in a room felt like 50."
27:38;27:39;"It was overwhelming."
27:39;27:42;"And now that the musical is being formally shared,"
27:42;27:45;"it's still stressful for me a little bit, I have to be honest,"
27:45;27:47;"because as you can imagine, I'm actually sending--"
27:47;27:49;"I'm on stage sending it out."
27:49;27:55;"So to be in the audience receiving it is a whole head spinner for me."
27:55;27:56;"Oh, yeah, that's true."
27:56;27:59;"Yeah, as a musician, you never can--"
27:59;28:00;"How could you, right?"
28:00;28:02;"Yeah, you have such a different vibe."
28:02;28:04;"So after this run in Cambridge,"
28:04;28:06;"do you know where it's going to go next for everybody else"
28:06;28:09;"who wants to see it around the country, or that's kind of TBD?"
28:09;28:14;"I think the general sense of movement is toward being in New York next year,"
28:14;28:16;"but there's no assumption about anything."
28:16;28:20;"We're just keeping our eyes on the prize and our heads down"
28:20;28:23;"and just keep doing what we're doing one in front of the other."
28:23;28:26;"But yeah, ideally it would be to share it in New York"
28:26;28:28;"and then ultimately to share it around the planet."
28:28;28:29;"Tight."

38:17;38:22;"- We were also reflecting recently about the,"
38:22;38:24;"what are your memories of Radiohead opening for you?"
38:24;38:26;"'Cause that was right in that era, right?"
38:26;38:28;"That was like at the peak of touring, Jagged Little Pill?"
38:28;38:30;"- Yeah, that was, I just remember listening"
38:30;38:33;"to so many new songs because I, you know,"
38:33;38:35;"I was the girl that listened to meditation music, you know?"
38:35;38:38;"I was super highly sensitive and easily affected"
38:38;38:40;"by even the tiniest of energies."
38:40;38:43;"So people often thought that I'd be blasting, you know,"
38:43;38:45;"anthrax in my hotel room on my days off."
38:45;38:47;"And I was like quite the opposite, actually."
38:47;38:48;"So I didn't listen to a lot of music."
38:48;38:50;"And when Jagged Little Pill came out,"
38:50;38:52;"everyone kept giving, doing initial records"
38:52;38:54;"and giving me every record that was out there"
38:54;38:56;"and the Radiohead records,"
38:56;38:59;"and Taylor Hawkins handed it to me and he said,"
38:59;39:02;"""Let's listen to this together at the back of the bus,"
39:02;39:05;"on our way to God knows where we were traveling from."""
39:05;39:07;"And I just listened to it front to bottom"
39:07;39:09;"and I was completely blown away at all the subtleties"
39:09;39:11;"and the mix and the, you know,"
39:11;39:14;"the magic that is and was them."
39:14;39:16;"And then when it came time to try and figure out"
39:16;39:19;"who to play with in America, on our American tour,"
39:19;39:21;"a third name was either thrown into the hat"
39:21;39:23;"or, I don't know which version it was,"
39:23;39:25;"but it was just super fun for me as an artist"
39:25;39:28;"to share the stage with people whom I bowed down to."
39:28;39:30;"- One of Jake's favorite of your songs is ""Thank You,"""
39:30;39:31;"and we were listening to that and we were,"
39:31;39:33;"as we were revisiting that song, we were kind of like,"
39:33;39:35;"""This reminds us of Radiohead in some ways."""
39:35;39:37;"And we were like, ""Oh, maybe there's a slight Radiohead influence."""
39:37;39:39;"And then we thought about it later and we were like,"
39:39;39:41;"""Maybe Radiohead was actually influenced by you."""
39:41;39:43;"That's what we started to think."
39:43;39:44;"(laughing)"
39:44;39:45;"- Let's not get crazy."
39:45;39:46;"- Well, who knows?"
39:46;39:48;"I mean, they were the opener."
39:48;39:50;"- Yeah, yeah, hilarious."
39:50;39:52;"No, but they, you know, I always felt as an artist,"
39:52;39:56;"you know, there's certain sort of factions of self"
39:56;39:58;"that were invisible in certain contexts."
39:58;40:00;"Like my academic part was invisible"
40:00;40:01;"in the rock and roll world,"
40:01;40:04;"and my vocalist was invisible in certain other areas."
40:04;40:07;"But when I was on tour, I always felt like Tom York"
40:07;40:10;"was fascinated with my evolution as an artist."
40:10;40:12;"And I remember him having said somewhere"
40:12;40:15;"that he was excited about what songs were coming down,"
40:15;40:17;"you know, were coming in the future."
40:17;40:19;"And I remember just really being touched by that"
40:19;40:20;"because so many people were, you know,"
40:20;40:23;"""She's gonna be bankable, scalable,"" you know."
40:23;40:26;"And there were so many other orientations and projections."
40:26;40:29;"And just for him to say something that simple, like,"
40:29;40:32;"""Yeah, I look forward to beholding her evolution"
40:32;40:34;"in his own way,"" his having said that."
40:34;40:35;"It's just like an outbreath for me."
40:35;40:38;"Like, finally, someone just cares about my evolution"
40:38;40:40;"and not about what it means externally."
40:40;40:41;"What a relief."
40:41;40:42;"- All right, yeah. - That's awesome."
40:42;40:45;"- And that makes total sense, especially at that moment"
40:45;40:47;"when you basically, like, released, like,"
40:47;40:48;"the thriller of the '90s."
40:48;40:49;"- Yeah."
40:49;40:51;"- People--I'm sure so many people around you"
40:51;40:54;"were just all of-- their concern was--"
40:54;40:55;"- Frothing."
40:55;40:57;"- Yeah, how do we--yeah, whip this thing up"
40:57;41:01;"in this album to be just as big as possible."
41:01;41:04;"And so it's cool for somebody to be a fan of you"
41:04;41:05;"and to say in the moment, like,"
41:05;41:08;"""Yeah, and where's this gonna lead to?"""
41:08;41:11;"- Yeah, and that also gave me, in some weird way,"
41:11;41:13;"like, in a brotherly way, it gave me permission"
41:13;41:16;"to do whatever I wanted to write next"
41:16;41:19;"without, you know, without the daunting pressure"
41:19;41:20;"of having to somehow repeat"
41:20;41:21;"as though I could do that anyway."
41:21;41:23;"I don't even think it's possible."

43:27;43:30;"This is super random, but I've always wondered this."
43:30;43:34;"Do you ever think about the fact that quite a few of the biggest albums of the '90s"
43:34;43:36;"were made by Canadian women?"
43:36;43:40;"And I specifically think about you, Shania, and Celine Dion."
43:40;43:42;"Canada's just not that big of a country."
43:42;43:43;"No."
43:43;43:45;"Gigantic, tens of millions selling albums."
43:45;43:49;"People from a country a tenth the size of the U.S."
43:49;43:51;"Is there anything to that?"
43:51;43:54;"Yeah, I really think it's the fluoride in the water up there, actually."
43:54;43:55;"Ah."
43:55;43:58;"I've had cheeky thoughts about why that is."
43:58;44:02;"It's so cold in the winters there that all we could do was dialogue."
44:02;44:05;"There's a perspective and a lens that we look through."
44:05;44:09;"I could be crassly broad-strokey."
44:09;44:11;"We're a very dialogical culture, you know,"
44:11;44:15;"and I think about people like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell and Neil Young"
44:15;44:17;"and Katie Lang and all these people."
44:17;44:21;"I think we really enjoy painting with our words and telling stories,"
44:21;44:23;"and we're an emotive bunch."
44:23;44:27;"But we're a feisty bunch with a lot of opinion,"
44:27;44:32;"but ultimately underneath all of it is just a really big, shiny little heart"
44:32;44:34;"trying to stay warm in the winter, you know?"
44:34;44:36;"I have no idea is my answer."
44:36;44:38;"No, that's a decent hypothesis."
44:38;44:40;"One thing that's come up on this show quite a bit"
44:40;44:43;"is moving from cold places to warm places."
44:43;44:45;"That's just a classic time crisis theme."
44:45;44:48;"So you were talking about moving from Canada to L.A."
44:48;44:52;"Do you ever need to go cold up?"
44:52;44:55;"Yeah, I need to cold it up sometimes, especially snow showing."
44:55;45:02;"Snow showing is one of the most exhausting athletic experiences of my whole life."
45:02;45:03;"It's so exhausting."
45:03;45:07;"So I miss snow showing and skiing."
45:07;45:08;"I skied a lot as a kid."
45:08;45:09;"We lived in Germany when I was younger,"
45:09;45:12;"so we skied all those really fun European mountains."
45:12;45:14;"But, yeah, I miss the snow a lot, and I need it."
45:14;45:18;"And my kids have both been born in L.A. and California here,"
45:18;45:22;"so when I talk about snow with them, there's a look in my eye that, you know,"
45:22;45:24;"they just want to know more."
45:24;45:26;"So I look forward to snowball fights."
45:26;45:29;"To show them the ancestral homeland?"
45:29;45:31;"Yes, keep that in their bones somehow."
45:31;45:32;"The motherland."
45:32;45:35;"Do you think of ""Jagged Little Pill"" as a warm-weather album,"
45:35;45:37;"being that you made it in L.A.,"
45:37;45:40;"or were you bringing a lot of cold-weather emotion to it?"
45:40;45:43;"Well, I think when I was writing ""Jagged Little Pill,"""
45:43;45:46;"I was basically five days a week, we'd write a song a day,"
45:46;45:50;"and then on the weekends, I would rollerblade from Santa Monica Pier"
45:50;45:52;"to Manhattan Beach and back."
45:52;45:53;"So I didn't have a ton of friends."
45:53;45:57;"I had maybe one, maybe two friendly acquaintances."
45:57;46:00;"So I basically just exercised my face off on the weekends,"
46:00;46:04;"and then I would come in during the week with Glenn Ballard at his studio,"
46:04;46:07;"and we would just write a song a day and eat our chopped salad."
46:07;46:10;"And it was just such an epic routine for me."
46:10;46:12;"It was something I really held onto,"
46:12;46:14;"especially with having moved to L.A. and not having known a soul."
46:14;46:19;"We were just talking about also how great and iconic the videos from that album were,"
46:19;46:21;"and this is such like a small thing,"
46:21;46:25;"but I just always love that it's cold in the ironic video,"
46:25;46:28;"that there's like hats and scarves and stuff."
46:28;46:32;"I don't know, like, and maybe that's why I think of it as such a cold-weather album,"
46:32;46:34;"but it's like, you know, you could have made that video in a convertible"
46:34;46:36;"driving down Sunset, but I don't know."
46:36;46:37;"I always like love the--"
46:37;46:38;"It was in Brooklyn."
46:38;46:40;"Oh, it was in Brooklyn."
46:40;46:41;"It was in Brooklyn."
46:41;46:44;"And yeah, snow is just such a part of my whole jam,"
46:44;46:47;"so I'm always trying to figure out how to get snow."
46:47;46:50;"Even in the musical, I was like, ""Can we get snow?"""
46:50;46:53;"Snow, snow, snow everywhere in photo shoots and everything."
46:53;46:55;"I'm constantly trying to chase the snow."
46:55;46:59;"Even the salt flats in the ""You Oughta Know"" video, it's just this whiteness."
46:59;47:00;"I love it."
47:00;47:02;"Oh, yeah, another iconic location."
47:02;47:03;"Great video."
47:03;47:04;"Thanks so much for calling in."
47:04;47:07;"Like, it's truly an honor to have you on the show."
47:07;47:09;"I hope we get a chance to see the musical,"
47:09;47:14;"and you're playing Arroyo Seco coming up here in Southern California."
47:14;47:15;"Yeah."
47:15;47:16;"Yeah, thank you for having me."
47:16;47:18;"I'm excited to have chatted with you guys."
47:18;47:20;"Thanks for the kind of interview you do."
47:20;47:22;"It's so unique."
47:22;47:24;"We don't interview a lot of people, so we don't--"
47:24;47:27;"It's basically--it's the kind I love, too."
47:27;47:29;"It's basically a conversation."
47:29;47:30;"Thanks so much."
47:30;47:32;"Yeah, thank you."
47:32;47:33;"Yeah, have a good one."
47:33;47:34;"You, too. Have a good one. Bye."
47:34;47:35;"Bye."
51:41;51:47;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
51:47;51:49;"Wow, I'm buzzing off that Alanis call."
51:49;51:50;"That was a great call."
51:50;51:51;"Man, she's so cool."
51:51;51:53;"I'm really walking on air."
51:53;51:54;"You know what's funny?"
51:54;51:55;"When she first got on the phone,"
51:55;51:57;"I suddenly tensed up because I was like,"
51:57;51:59;"""Is it Alanis or Alanis?"""
51:59;52:00;"Oh, wow."
52:00;52:02;"It's like a name that you know so well,"
52:02;52:03;"but then suddenly you just get, like,"
52:03;52:04;"in your head about it,"
52:04;52:06;"and then she said, ""Alanis."""
52:06;52:08;"Wow, you're operating on another level."
52:08;52:11;"I like that she has such, like, a kind vibe."
52:11;52:12;"Like, you can tell, like, she's somebody"
52:12;52:14;"who's, like, spent time thinking about"
52:14;52:15;"the meaning of life,"
52:15;52:17;"what it means to be a human being."
52:17;52:18;"Mindfulness."
52:19;52:20;"Yeah, she's cool."
52:20;52:22;"Should have asked her about the dead."
52:22;52:23;"Oh, man."
52:23;52:24;"Missed opportunity."
52:24;52:25;"Just at the very end."
52:25;52:27;"By the way, Alanis, like The Grateful Dead?"
52:27;52:29;"What's your favorite period of the dead?"
52:29;52:31;"Yeah."
52:31;52:32;"Spring '90."
52:32;52:34;"Also, the Alanis-Alanis thing."
52:34;52:37;"I've been, like, starting to take some singing lessons."
52:37;52:38;"Really?"
52:38;52:40;"Because losing your voice on tour"
52:40;52:41;"is the worst thing ever."
52:41;52:42;"It's happened a couple times."
52:42;52:44;"So, you know, I always, like, kind of,"
52:44;52:46;"as we start looking towards the future of touring,"
52:46;52:47;"I try to get together,"
52:47;52:49;"and people give you warm-ups you can do"
52:49;52:51;"and ways of thinking about singing"
52:51;52:52;"and things like that."
52:52;52:54;"So it's a way to preserve the skill set in the long run."
52:54;52:57;"Yeah, because you might sometimes do something"
52:57;52:59;"on the record to, like, make a point,"
52:59;53:01;"but if you do that night after night,"
53:01;53:02;"you might do--"
53:02;53:04;"Man, I was just reading about SZA."
53:04;53:05;"Mm-hmm."
53:05;53:07;"She's been talking publicly about having, like,"
53:07;53:08;"some real intense vocal issues"
53:08;53:10;"from touring a lot the past year,"
53:10;53:12;"and I'm sure she'll be fine,"
53:12;53:14;"but that's just, like, heavy s--t."
53:14;53:15;"It's like, you know, when you're a singer,"
53:15;53:16;"like, that's your thing."
53:16;53:17;"Yeah."
53:17;53:18;"It's a terrible feeling when you lose your voice"
53:18;53:19;"or when you can't perform."
53:19;53:21;"So anyway, I'm always on the lookout for ways"
53:21;53:23;"that I can make my life less stressful,"
53:23;53:25;"especially having not sang very much in the past few years,"
53:25;53:28;"but so much of what they talk about sometimes"
53:28;53:31;"when you're going over stuff is vowel sound."
53:31;53:32;"Hmm."
53:32;53:34;"And as we've talked about on the show,"
53:34;53:36;"people often say that I have, like, a weird-ass accent,"
53:36;53:38;"so there'll be times when they're like--"
53:38;53:41;"We'll go back and listen to some early Vampire Weekend songs,"
53:41;53:42;"which, like, sound crazy to me,"
53:42;53:44;"and we're, like, working on some word,"
53:44;53:47;"and I was, like, showing her the song"
53:47;53:49;"""Kids Don't Stand a Chance"" or something,"
53:49;53:52;"and there's some word, like, the word ""pure,"""
53:52;53:54;"and probably back then, I'd be like,"
53:54;53:55;"♪ With pure legit ♪"
53:55;53:57;"Like, I would do that kind of thing,"
53:57;53:59;"and she was just like, ""No, but we're gonna say 'pure.'"""
53:59;54:00;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
54:00;54:02;"I was like, ""Whatever, you tell me."""
54:02;54:04;"And then we were getting to some word."
54:04;54:05;"I sang it one way, and she was like,"
54:05;54:07;"""Come on, how's it pronounced?"""
54:07;54:11;"And I was like, ""Mm, this is how I would pronounce it."""
54:11;54:13;"Whatever word it was, like..."
54:13;54:14;"- Uh-huh."
54:14;54:17;"- ""Devastating"" or--what are the words in that song?"
54:17;54:19;"""France."" I just say stuff weird."
54:19;54:20;"- ""France."""
54:20;54:22;"- And it's funny because it makes you think about vowel sounds"
54:22;54:25;"and ""Alanis,"" ""Alanis."""
54:25;54:28;"- So you'll be singing the song slightly differently now?"
54:28;54:29;"- Well, it's interesting."
54:29;54:31;"Sometimes if you change the vowel sound--"
54:31;54:33;"I haven't actually tried this stuff out."
54:33;54:35;"I was, like, showing her one of our new songs,"
54:35;54:37;"and I was like, ""This one's gonna be, like,"
54:37;54:39;"a little intense to sing live."""
54:39;54:41;"- Yeah. - You know, I want to get up to it."
54:41;54:43;"And she was just showing me, like, certain ways"
54:43;54:45;"to kind of tweak the pronunciation,"
54:45;54:48;"and then I did it, and I listened back to the recording."
54:48;54:50;"You couldn't even tell the difference."
54:50;54:52;"It's just like you're--I've always wondered that too,"
54:52;54:54;"if, like, people with certain accents"
54:54;54:56;"are naturally slightly better singers"
54:56;54:59;"because the vowel sounds lend themselves more to singing."
54:59;55:00;"- The British."
55:00;55:02;"- Yeah, I always thought about, like, a Cockney accent,"
55:02;55:04;"like, ""Oy,"" 'cause apparently ""oy"" is kind of, like,"
55:04;55:06;"an easier vowel, whereas I think about my accent"
55:06;55:09;"or, like, New Jersey, I feel like that's, like, the worst."
55:09;55:12;"- Yeah, it's real, like, flat, angular."

56:59;57:00;"- Well, a couple things happened."
57:00;57:02;"One, Vampire Weekend got back on Instagram."
57:02;57:03;"- That's huge."
57:03;57:05;"- Got a couple pieces of press."
57:05;57:07;"- I saw that. That is headline worthy."

57:14;57:16;"I don't know what everybody else is gonna think about that,"
57:16;57:19;"but I've totally been in this kind of, like, weird place"
57:19;57:21;"where the album is so close to being done."
57:21;57:22;"It's basically done."
57:22;57:24;"But, you know, even when an album's done,"
57:24;57:25;"you got to make sure you like how--"
57:25;57:27;"the mixing and mastering and stuff."
57:27;57:29;"And got festivals this summer, and we're, like--"
57:29;57:30;"- Wow. - Doing all the--"
57:30;57:32;"You know, it's, like, really coming together,"
57:32;57:33;"but it's funny, like,"
57:33;57:36;"as you start kind of awakening these things."
57:36;57:38;"Like, our Instagram account had two pictures"
57:38;57:40;"of Steve Buscemi from five years ago."
57:40;57:41;"That was it. - Really?"
57:41;57:44;"- And they were like, ""You got to start using this again."""
57:44;57:45;"Like, everybody-- like, the promoters,"
57:45;57:47;"they was like, ""You guys got to start using this."""
57:47;57:48;"And I was like, ""All right."""
57:48;57:49;"So I just posted a few random pictures,"

57:53;57:55;"I was like, ""Nothing cryptic."

57:58;57:59;"We're finishing it."

58:00;58:02;"We're getting started. That's all."""
58:02;58:03;"- Getting warmed up here."
58:03;58:04;"- We're just getting warmed up."
58:04;58:06;"It's like, I kind of do just want to be more straightforward,"
58:06;58:08;"'cause I don't like all this, like, weird cryptic [bleep]"
58:08;58:10;"kind of like, ""Why are we playing shows?"""
58:10;58:12;"Because the album's almost done."
58:12;58:14;"""Why are you playing festivals?"""
58:14;58:17;"'Cause that's a good place where you can get a nice check"
58:17;58:19;"and go play for a [bleep]load of people."
58:19;58:21;"""Why are you playing small shows before that?"""
58:21;58:23;"So that we're ready for the festivals."
58:23;58:25;"""When's the album gonna come out?"""
58:25;58:27;"When it's done, obviously, we booked these shows"
58:27;58:29;"with the expectation that the album would be done"
58:29;58:32;"in or around that era, that amount of time."
58:32;58:34;"Like, that's what's happening. It's all straightforward."
58:34;58:37;"""Why are you posting a picture of a Columbia fleece"
58:37;58:39;"on Instagram?"""
58:39;58:41;"'Cause that's what I was wearing when they told me"
58:41;58:43;"I got to get the Instagram poppin',"
58:43;58:45;"so I took a little picture of it."
58:45;58:47;"- And the album is called ""Columbia Fleece."""

01:00:00;01:00:03;"- But anyway, so these shows that we're talking about"
01:00:03;01:00:07;"are Richard Pictures, which is Jake's Grateful Dead cover band,"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"formerly known as Dick Picks, and Vampire Weekend,"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"doing two shows, not two nights, two shows,"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"Saturday night and Sunday morning,"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"in Ojai, California, at the Libby Bowl."
01:00:19;01:00:22;"And I'm very excited about these shows."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"This will be the first time-- well, you and I have shared the stage before."
01:00:25;01:00:28;"We opened for Bernie Sanders in Washington Square Park."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"- That's right. - We played in Dirty Projectors together."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"But this will be the first time that Richard Pictures and Vampire Weekend"
01:00:34;01:00:37;"have shared the stage. - It's huge. I'm thrilled."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"- It's huge. I mean, I also feel like-- it's funny,"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"because last week we announced the show, and you could see--"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"I also forget, because it's been a while, that our fans are from all over the place."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"They're like, ""That's cool! I live in Argentina!"""
01:00:49;01:00:52;"And it's like, oh yeah, this is a fairly regional show."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"- Oh, this is very local. - It's very local. It's not even in LA."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"- Yeah. - It's 90 minutes outside of LA, but Ojai's the right vibe."
01:00:59;01:01:02;"- This is a kind first step. - Ojai's a kind vibe."
01:01:02;01:01:06;"It's a kind first step. Ojai and the entire Ventura County,"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Santa Paula, all those places recently survived one of the worst fires"
01:01:09;01:01:14;"in California history. Even just the fact that the community survived that comeback,"
01:01:14;01:01:18;"it feels like the perfect place to do a chill, quiet relaunch."
01:01:18;01:01:21;"So anyway, maybe there's some tickets left. You can look it up."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Very reasonably priced. - What are they running?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"- In and around $20. - Okay."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"- We made the decision that we're like, ""These shows are not about making money."""
01:01:30;01:01:34;"We just want to make sure that anybody-- the real heads who want to see the show can come."
01:01:34;01:01:38;"- That's very Fugazi of you. - Right. What they used to do, $5?"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"- $5. At some point they must have changed."
01:01:41;01:01:46;"I feel like I saw them in '98 or something at a real professional rock venue,"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"and I think it was more than $5. - Inflation."
01:01:49;01:01:54;"- All good. Yeah, it's going to be great. Saturday night, June 16th, and then--"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"- And Sunday morning. - Sunday morning?"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- Yeah. - 11 a.m.?"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"- Yeah, you guys are hitting the stage at 11 a.m. on Sunday."
01:02:01;01:02:05;"- Okay, great. Well, The Dead did a lot of daytime weekend shows."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"- Oh, yeah. No, that's part of the thought that I had."
01:02:08;01:02:13;"Because, you know, like when you're a young band and you play in festivals,"
01:02:13;01:02:16;"at first they might be throwing you on 1, 2 p.m."
01:02:16;01:02:19;"Even more brutally, sometimes like 11 a.m."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"It's like somebody's got to kick off that main stage."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"- Oh, my God. - I even remember--"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"- Just like earnest, like really heavy music at like 11 a.m."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"- It doesn't work for everybody."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"So you always want to play at night, and you're really excited about it,"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"but then you get to the place and you're more or less playing at night all the time,"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"and there's a part of me that's like, you know what?"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"I remember like chill, early Vampire Weekend shows"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"where you're just playing during the day."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Our music works during the day. - Totally."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- We can do both."
01:02:46;01:02:51;"So that's why I didn't want to do Saturday night and Sunday night."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"And also it's Father's Day weekend. - Right."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"- So we got to start grilling after Sunday afternoon."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- The whole thing will be wrapped up by 2."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"- Yeah, straight to the grill."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"I might even wear the apron on stage. - Nice."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"- With the tongs. - Bathing suit under."
01:03:05;01:03:09;"- And a bathing suit under, because we got to start grilling ASAP."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures Father's Day barbecue."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"- It's going to be a hell of an event."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"- I hope that families come too. - Yeah."
01:03:17;01:03:22;"- I want to see some fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, fathers and daughters."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"- I have a few friends bringing their kids. - I just want to see families."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- Yeah, I think that's going to be the vibe."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- That would be cool. It'll be a good vibe."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"I think there's a farmer's market and walking distance."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"- Great. If that 8-minute Cape Cod feels going on a little too long,"
01:03:35;01:03:39;"pop over to the farmer's market, buy some produce."
01:03:39;01:03:44;"Come back. - Oh, they're still in it."

01:10:44;01:10:47;"you have to make sure you know all the old [bleep] too."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"So it's like an interesting moment"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"when you're kind of, like, starting to practice again"

01:10:59;01:11:02;"if you count the first three albums plus deep cuts"
01:11:02;01:11:06;"and some kind of, like, extended Vampire Weekend family songs,"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"you're getting well over 40 songs in the catalog."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"Then you throw in the new album covers, we could probably--"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Pushing 60."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I think we could do--"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"People-- When we announced the Ohai show,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"a few people on Instagram were like,"

01:11:45;01:11:47;"That's counting maybe a few covers."

01:11:49;01:11:50;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"You're looking at, like, a two-and-a-half-hour show."

01:12:17;01:12:18;"Yeah, dude."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"Two separate sets."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"Okay, I'm not saying we're doing no repeats, but--"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Well, we're also not playing as long as you are."
01:12:23;01:12:27;"Plus, we're playing the music of the Grateful Dead."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"There's a vast catalog."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"That's true."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"And we were like, if we're doing these two opening slots,"
01:12:34;01:12:40;"it's conceptually strong as well as fun to do no repeats."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"You're standing on the shoulders of giants."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"Yep."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"You're doing your thing, though."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"I mean, one way that I think about it, too, is like,"
01:12:46;01:12:50;"rather than get all up in my head about, like, oh, no repeats,"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"you know, what's interesting is that--"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"also why I'm glad we're not doing two night shows."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"Saturday night and Sunday morning are two very distinct vibes."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Yep."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"So you can think about it that way."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"So rather than be like, well, what songs--"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"you know, it's like, well, whatever the first three songs should be"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"on a Saturday night versus the next morning,"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"""Vampire Weekend"" hitting the stage,"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"""Dawn Daylight,"" ""Farmer's Market,"" ""Children Playing."""
01:13:13;01:13:14;"""What's Your Opener?"" Yeah."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"""A Man Selling Ice Cream,"" all these things that happen."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"Then, yeah, it's a different vibe."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"It's a different vibe."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"So anyway."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"We had a rehearsal last night, and we were having that same discussion."
01:13:24;01:13:28;"We're like, okay, Saturday night show, Sunday morning show."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"What's a good opener for Sunday morning?"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"I don't know."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"I could see, like, ""Bird Song"" on Sunday during the day."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"You might get it."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Really?"
01:13:35;01:13:36;"You might be--"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"I'm not saying that has to be the opener."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"You might be tapped in."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"I'm not saying that has to be the opener."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"[HUMMING]"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"And maybe ""Dark Star."""
01:13:44;01:13:46;"That could go night or day, actually."
01:13:46;01:13:47;"Yeah."
01:13:47;01:13:51;"The Grateful Dead also, interestingly, their music is versatile."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"[MUSIC - THE GRATEFUL DEAD, ""DARK STAR""]"
01:13:57;01:14:03;"Get up, get on, get out of the door."
01:14:03;01:14:09;"Play cold music on the barroom floor."
01:14:09;01:14:15;"Drown in your laughter and dead to the core."
01:14:15;01:14:21;"There's a drink in the night, cheers, let's loose on the tower."
01:14:21;01:14:27;"Take a whole can of wine, just a stone, man."
01:14:27;01:14:33;"Fire, fire on the mountain."
01:14:51;01:14:55;"So anyway, I will say that this Ojai weekend--"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"do you know the term of these, the restaurant business?"
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Soft opening?"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Yeah, I've heard that term."
01:15:00;01:15:03;"I look at these shows as kind of a soft opening."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"Sure."
01:15:04;01:15:06;"But anyway, I do think these are special shows."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"If it's not sold out, come."
01:15:08;01:15:11;"If it is sold out, we'll definitely be doing more [BLEEP] like this."
01:15:11;01:15:15;"Also, I saw a couple people being like, ""Yo, I live in the UK."
01:15:15;01:15:18;"I would love to catch Richard Pictures and Vampire Weekend."
01:15:18;01:15:19;"Any chance you're bringing them to Europe?"""
01:15:19;01:15:22;"And I was like, ""Let's see if we can make that work."""
01:15:22;01:15:25;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Richard Pictures, live in London."
01:15:27;01:15:32;"A semi-professional, grateful-to-the-cover band."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"Easily top five in LA."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"Yeah, okay."
01:15:36;01:15:37;"I feel that."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"Okay, well anyway, so that's enough about the Ojai shows."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"We'll let you know how they go."
01:15:41;01:15:47;"We talked a little bit the other day about the Tic Tac travesty, I would say."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"Right."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"For people who don't remember, Tic Tacs are loaded with sugar,"
01:15:51;01:15:58;"but because they call the serving size of Tic Tacs one Tic Tac, one capsule,"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"and each capsule has less than five grams of sugar,"
01:16:00;01:16:05;"they're allowed to claim on the label that each serving has zero sugar."
01:16:05;01:16:08;"It's some weird rule that if you're less than five, you can round down."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Whereas if you look at the ingredients of Tic Tacs,"
01:16:10;01:16:14;"the number one ingredient is, of course, sugar."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"Tic Tacs are loaded with sugar, but they can kind of play it both ways."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"So anyway, we got an email from a fellow named Guillermo."
01:16:20;01:16:24;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"He emailed us and said, ""Hey, gents."
01:16:26;01:16:29;"I got this email back from someone I know at Ferrero."""
01:16:29;01:16:34;"As we also pointed out the other day, Tic Tac is owned by Ferrero, the Italian company."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Tic Tacs are Italian."
01:16:35;01:16:38;"He said, ""Not sure how important it is for them, but maybe."""
01:16:38;01:16:43;"So this guy Guillermo emailed a guy named Giovanni who works for Ferrero,"
01:16:43;01:16:48;"and he said, ""Hello, Giovanni. Hope all is well. How are things?"""
01:16:48;01:16:50;"""Just passing along a bit of negative press."
01:16:50;01:16:53;"I heard about Ferrero this weekend in case it's helpful."""
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Uh-oh."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"""I was listening to a radio show on Apple Music this weekend."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"It's kind of like a podcast."""
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Okay, fair enough. It is kind of like a podcast."
01:17:01;01:17:04;"""It's called Time Crisis, and it's hosted by Ezra Koenig,"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"the singer of a popular band called Vampire Weekend."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"They often talk about food culture and advertising,"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"and on this episode, they spent a good amount of time on Tic Tacs"
01:17:12;01:17:16;"and its advertised zero-sugar content, something maybe you think about."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"In any case, it wasn't positive,"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"and they asked if anyone listening from Tic Tac to respond to them."
01:17:21;01:17:27;"I assume no one at Tic Tac/Ferrero would have heard it since the audience isn't huge."""
01:17:27;01:17:28;"How do you know--?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Well, okay, Guillermo, I appreciate the email,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"but how do you know our audience isn't huge?"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"""They have about 10,000 Twitter followers @TimeCrisis2000."""
01:17:36;01:17:37;"That's not too shabby."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"That's not too shabby. We put a lot of work in to get that up."
01:17:40;01:17:44;"""But passing it along, in case it's something that Ferrero would want to respond to,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"you can find the show on Apple Music, and they have an email as well."
01:17:47;01:17:48;"Hope this is helpful."""
01:17:48;01:17:51;"Then Giovanni wrote back to Guillermo, ""Thank you very much for the heads up."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"I will pass this on to my Tic Tac colleagues."""
01:17:53;01:17:56;"So we have reason to believe that over the past couple weeks,"
01:17:56;01:18:01;"some of the Tic Tac division of Ferrero may be heard about that negative press."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"Some of the higher-ups."
01:18:02;01:18:05;"So thank you, Guillermo, for passing that along."
01:18:05;01:18:07;"And I would like a response."
01:18:07;01:18:12;"Now that we know that people at Tic Tac are aware of the controversy,"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"I would like a response."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"And if anybody else has any other channels to get into Tic Tac."
01:18:17;01:18:23;"Hey, listen, man, if your American FDA allows you to round down,"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"those are the rules. That's what they'll come back with."
01:18:26;01:18:34;"Excuse me, gentlemen, Ferrero did not create the disgusting culture of your FDA."
01:18:34;01:18:37;"Of your sugar consumption and your obesity."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"I don't know what I'm doing."
01:18:38;01:18:43;"It's like a very upper-crust Italian."
01:18:43;01:18:47;"In Italy, we sell many products full of--oh, this is definitely not Italian."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"Whatever."
01:18:48;01:18:54;"We sell many products full of sugar, and yet our obesity rate is far below yours."
01:18:54;01:18:58;"We merely play by the rules of your so-called democracy."
01:18:58;01:18:59;"Almost going Russian there."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Yeah, now it's Russian."
01:19:00;01:19:09;"Here in Italy, we do not believe it is our purview to change the laws of your country."
01:19:09;01:19:12;"We in Italy do not round down."
01:19:12;01:19:18;"The disgusting legacy of American imperialism is a stain on all of you."
01:19:18;01:19:24;"To direct this animosity towards the humble Tic Tac is shameful."
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Division of Ferrero."
01:19:25;01:19:33;"Division--to direct this animosity at the humble Tic Tac division of Ferrero is absolutely shameful."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"It's a little more Spanish, I think."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I'll say this, though, and I think I tweeted this."
01:19:37;01:19:42;"I usually have a tin of Altoids in my car, and the next day I looked at it,"
01:19:42;01:19:45;"and it's three Altoids per serving."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"And an Altoid's bigger than a Tic Tac."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Altoids is keeping it real."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Yeah."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Shout out to Altoids."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Because some people are going to have one Altoid."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Some people."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"That's one end of the spectrum."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"That's a serving."
01:19:57;01:19:58;"One is a serving."
01:19:58;01:20:02;"And an Altoid is so much meatier than a Tic Tac."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"It's like probably 2.5 Tic Tacs."
01:20:04;01:20:10;"Average serving size for a Tic Tac, I would accept two, but it's really more like three or four."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"And Altoids is keeping it real."
01:20:12;01:20:23;"If you find our competitors at Altoids to be so much more ethical,"
01:20:23;01:20:30;"by all means, indulge in that chalky, disgusting English mint."
01:20:30;01:20:40;"But when you want a small, smooth capsule, you will come to Tic Tac regardless of our sugar content."
01:20:40;01:20:44;"I mean, he's kind of right, pretending that my terrible impression was a real person."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"He's got a point."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"We just did his job for him."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"We just did his point."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Yeah, it's true."
01:21:07;01:21:12;"[singing in Italian]"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"I think it's time to get in the top five."
01:21:42;01:21:48;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:48;01:21:52;"So this week on the top five, we're comparing the top five songs on iTunes currently"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1974."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"Why 1974?"
01:21:57;01:22:00;"That was the year that Alanis was born."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"That's right, Alanis."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"The Queen Alanis Morissette was born in 1974."
01:22:04;01:22:08;"She just had her birthday, so she is 44."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"44."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"We're two years older than Kanye."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Well, no, four years."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Kanye's 77."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Oh, he's 77."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"He's my year, dude."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"Okay."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"I'm older than Kanye."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"They still could have gone to high school together."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Yeah, sure."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Five years younger than Jay-Z."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"Interesting."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"She got started early, dropping classics."
01:22:24;01:22:30;"The number five song this week in 1974 is Marvin Hamlisch, ""From the Soundtrack to the Sting."""
01:22:30;01:22:31;"Oh, great movie."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"I never saw it."
01:22:32;01:22:36;"It's about old-timey pool sharks?"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"Card sharks."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Card sharks with Paul Newman?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"Yeah, and Robert Redford."
01:22:40;01:22:44;"So this is the Entertainer, which I guess is the famous, what's his name?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"Scott Joplin."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"Scott Joplin, old-timey piano."
01:22:47;01:22:51;"So this was actually made it on the Billboard charts back then."
01:22:51;01:23:01;"But this was a re-record?"
01:23:01;01:23:02;"By Marvin?"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"Marvin Hamlisch."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Oh, this song, okay."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"That's funny."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"This was a, wow, okay."
01:23:10;01:23:14;"I guess the movie kind of reintroduced this song into the public consciousness."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"It's honestly worth watching that movie."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"It's a great movie."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"I'll check it out."
01:23:20;01:23:27;"The movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"That's interesting."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"It's very lighthearted."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"It's sort of like the same tone as Ocean's Eleven."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Really?"
01:23:35;01:23:41;"Like it's a bunch of movie stars in their prime having fun making a caper movie."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"It has a real comedic edge."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"I mean, the song definitely has."
01:23:45;01:23:51;"But can you imagine a movie like that even being nominated for an Oscar today?"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"It's cool that it won."
01:23:53;01:24:01;"Number five on the charts, that's pretty wild."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"I mean, it's an iconic piece of music."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Early summer of '74."
01:24:05;01:24:14;"Were they playing that on the radio or were these people walking right out of the movie and being like, ""Oh, let me get this single."""
01:24:14;01:24:16;"By the 7-inch."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"Yeah, like kids hanging out in their room listening to that."
01:24:19;01:24:23;"Probably on the radio too, but it would seem really out of sync with the rest of the radio."
01:24:23;01:24:29;"Well, for instance, the number five song right now on the iTunes charts, slightly different."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Imagine Dragons."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"They're hanging tough."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"They're the biggest band in the world."
01:24:35;01:24:40;"Say what you will, but these guys are hit makers and they're crushing it."
01:24:40;01:24:49;"Do these guys ever play those festivals like Coachella or, I don't know."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"I mean, they're too big for Lollapalooza or Pitchfork probably, right?"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"What about like Reading Festival in England or whatever?"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"I don't think you're going to see them at Pitchfork, but I don't know."
01:24:58;01:25:03;"I mean, they might be so big that playing festivals is barely worth it for them."
01:25:03;01:25:06;"But like Beyonce played Coachella, right?"
01:25:06;01:25:07;"Yeah."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"No, Coachella is definitely leaning more mainstream lately."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"I don't know."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"I don't know if you'd see Imagine Dragons."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"I don't think you'd see them at Coachella."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"Bonnaroo."
01:25:16;01:25:19;"I'm sure they do festivals somewhere, but they're so big."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"They might just be doing their own kind of like, I wonder if they do stadiums."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"Okay, here we go."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Upcoming festivals for Imagine Dragons."
01:25:25;01:25:29;"Summerfest 2018, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
01:25:29;01:25:34;"FM4 Frequency Festival in Austria."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"And then some other deep, like Zurich."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Lollapalooza Berlin."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Oh, okay."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"That's tight."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"All right."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Yeah, so they're on their own wave."
01:25:43;01:25:46;"Lost Lake Festival, Phoenix, Arizona."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"Should we drive out for that?"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"TC Road Trip."
01:25:49;01:25:50;"All right."
01:25:50;01:25:54;"Number four song in 1974, The Stylistics, ""You Make Me Feel Brand New."""
01:25:54;01:25:57;"Oh, dude, this song is great."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"Do I know this?"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Sitar."
01:26:01;01:26:07;"I've done this one karaoke a few times."
01:26:07;01:26:10;"Oh, this is that Philly sound."
01:26:10;01:26:21;"They're a Philadelphia soul group."
01:26:21;01:26:26;"Haitian intro."
01:26:26;01:26:29;"Beautiful orchestral strings, the hallmark of the Philly sound."
01:26:29;01:26:40;"With that drum fill, too."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Gorgeous vibrato."
01:26:41;01:27:07;"They take it down here."
01:27:07;01:27:32;"And then there's this really dope key change from the falsetto part comes in."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"Really taking their time."
01:27:33;01:28:02;"I like the way the song's unfolding."
01:28:02;01:28:12;"It's that voice."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"So high."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Amazing."

01:28:18;01:28:19;"Cool song."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"Did that one at the Smog Cutter a few times."

01:28:25;01:28:26;"I haven't been doing it."
01:28:26;01:28:31;"There's a spot in Glendale I want to check out that some of my friends are into."
01:28:31;01:28:34;"Some of my friends."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"I haven't been on the karaoke tip, dude."

01:28:37;01:28:38;"Yeah, I mean karaoke--"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"I used to be pretty into it."

01:28:54;01:28:55;"Yeah."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"They were like early 2000s kind of band."
01:28:57;01:29:00;"Like Killers and Yeah Yeah Yeahs and stuff."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Uh."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"More--"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"That might be technically correct."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"They're more like mid-2000s."
01:29:06;01:29:11;"Are they splitting the difference between the Killers and 30 Seconds to Mars?"
01:29:11;01:29:14;"I believe they come out of more of the--"
01:29:14;01:29:17;"originally out of the slight emo tradition."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"Like Fall Out Boy, you know who they are?"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"Yeah."
01:29:20;01:29:23;"But I think at this point they've been around for a super long time."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"They're probably 20 years deep on their-- well, 15 years deep on their career."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"The band started in 2004."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"Let's see, their first album came out in 2005."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"They're probably pretty young."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Okay."
01:29:34;01:29:35;"They're from Vegas."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"Vegas is like--"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Okay, yeah."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"The Killers are from Vegas too, right?"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Yeah, and Imagine Dragons."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Wow."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"A lot of Vegas natives."
01:29:41;01:29:44;"A lot of like big-- Vegas is the Canada of the US."
01:29:44;01:29:47;"Yeah, I was just thinking that Vegas is the Canada in terms of pound for pound."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"Monster artist."
01:29:48;01:29:51;"And also because you're allowed to like [bleep] on Vegas."
01:29:51;01:29:55;"So I think there is a slight sense that people are actually from Vegas being a little bit like [bleep] you."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Yeah."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"We'll show the world."
01:29:57;01:30:00;"In fact, I caught Paul Simon at the Hollywood Bowl last week."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Oh, nice, dude."
01:30:01;01:30:02;"Great show."
01:30:02;01:30:03;"I bet."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Hell of a song book."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Oh, yeah, and this is his final tour supposedly."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"I know."
01:30:07;01:30:11;"Just taking you through all the hits, moments of joy, moments of pain."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"Whole show ends with him alone on stage."
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Sounds of silence."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Just him and the guitar."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Wow."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"Hello, darkness, my old friend."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Closing show."

01:30:25;01:30:26;"Yeah."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"She was loving it."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"Yeah, man."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"It was a great show, but one thing I was going to say is that there was this moment where"
01:30:31;01:30:36;"he-- and he was like very funny and personable, telling stories and just kind of being himself."
01:30:36;01:30:40;"But there was one moment he said, you know, I played in Las Vegas the other day."
01:30:40;01:30:43;"Really one of my favorite towns."
01:30:43;01:30:44;"The whole audience laughs."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"Like you're allowed to [bleep] on Vegas is what I'm saying."
01:30:46;01:30:50;"And I'm sure it's one of those things where like people who are from Vegas are kind of like,"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"shut the [bleep] up."
01:30:51;01:30:52;"Nobody's ever seen the real Vegas."
01:30:52;01:30:55;"If you've even been to Vegas, you've only been to the strip."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Clearly something's in the water there."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"They're producing a lot of talent."

01:34:07;01:34:08;"Yeah."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Like, that pre-chorus that suddenly goes kind of--"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"I don't know what you call that, queen or something,"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"and having those orchestral--"

01:38:14;01:38:17;"Those tones, that keyboard tone."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"Welcome to London."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"And that's Ty Dolla $ign."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"I mean, Post Malone,"
01:38:35;01:38:36;"you can't say a bad word about him right now."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"He's crushing it."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"I wonder if he was bummed about"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"Designated Survivor getting canceled."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Because he was on the record as being a fan."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Yeah, he's not really speaking out."
01:38:46;01:38:47;"Maybe got a little too big time"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"to care about the little guys,"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"like Kiefer Sutherland."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Hey, Post, check out Kiefer's record."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"That'd be cool."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"Post Malone, Kiefer Sutherland collab."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"That'd be dope."
01:38:56;01:38:59;"The number two song, 1974,"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"Paul McCartney and Wings."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"This is a big one."

01:39:05;01:39:06;"Band on the Run."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Oh, okay."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"Same record."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"This is a very proggy song."
01:39:11;01:39:16;"Yeah."
01:39:17;01:39:22;"[singing]"
01:39:28;01:39:50;"It's proggy, but it's also not proggy"
01:39:50;01:39:53;"because the parts are super straightforward."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"There's no weird time signatures."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"He just is making weird--"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Cuts."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"Yeah, weird cuts."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Right."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Weird tempo and key changes."

01:40:08;01:40:11;"What's this song really about?"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"It's about a band on the run?"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"I don't know what this song's about."
01:40:15;01:40:20;"[singing]"
01:40:20;01:40:26;"This part's cool."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I love this part."

01:41:30;01:41:31;"Wait, what is--"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"[singing]"
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Is that a different song?"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"Oh, that's Live or Let Die."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"Oops."
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Yeah, yeah."
01:41:36;01:41:41;"[singing]"

01:42:12;01:42:14;"[singing]"
01:42:14;01:42:15;"All right, we get the idea."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"We don't need to listen to this whole song."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"It's a good song."
01:42:18;01:42:22;"The number two song in 2018."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"That's the current year."

01:42:24;01:42:25;"I haven't heard from him in--"

01:42:27;01:42:29;"He is back."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"That's Jake's take."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"Jake's takes on time crisis."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"I got some red hot takes today."
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Singing along with like half a band on the run."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"Just off-key falsetto."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"Mimicking the Moog."
01:42:43;01:42:45;"Oh, Shawn Mendes is back."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"You're listening to Jake Longstreet."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"You're listening to Jake Longstreet on Album Music Radio."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"In the news today, we've got Shawn Mendes."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"He's back."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"Shawn Mendes has returned, and boy, is he back."
01:42:56;01:42:58;"With a new song and a new album."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"His fans are flipping their wigs."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"I imagine we'll be seeing some shows from him."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"And who knows, maybe even some more music in the future."
01:43:05;01:43:06;"Oh, man."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Shawn Mendes."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Just radio voice saying nothing."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Saying truly nothing."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Shawn Mendes is back."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"Boy, his fans must be happy."
01:43:13;01:43:15;"He's got a new song called ""In My Blood."""
01:43:15;01:43:17;"It's from an album that was recently released."

01:43:20;01:43:21;"he's all over the place."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"From shows to singles to albums."
01:43:23;01:43:26;"He is out there promoting, and the fans are eating it up."

01:44:06;01:44:08;"I'm overwhelmed and insecure."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Give me something."
01:44:09;01:44:11;"He's getting a little more introspective."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Mm-hmm."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"He's grown up."
01:44:14;01:44:18;"Just have a drink and you'll feel better."
01:44:18;01:44:21;"Just take her home and you'll feel better."

01:44:29;01:44:32;"Help me."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"It's like the walls are caving in."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"He stated the song is about struggling with anxiety."
01:44:36;01:44:40;"Sometimes I feel like giving up."
01:44:40;01:44:43;"The medicine is strong enough."
01:44:43;01:44:46;"Someone help me."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"I'm crawling in my skin."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Feels like we're built towards a big chorus."

01:44:55;01:44:57;"It isn't in my blood."
01:44:57;01:45:05;"It isn't in my blood."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"This basically sounds like ""Kings of Leon."""

01:45:09;01:45:11;"I don't know what that band sounds like."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"You know what ""Kings of Leon"" sounds like."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"I honestly don't."
01:45:14;01:45:17;"Okay, but I'm just saying, like, he's going for--"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"Yeah, like--"
01:45:19;01:45:22;"A kind of rock, but not rock-rock, like a--"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"To me, it's--"
01:45:23;01:45:24;"A kind of polished rock."
01:45:24;01:45:28;"To me, it's, like, distantly related to, like, U2."
01:45:28;01:45:30;"Oh, yeah, they kind of invented that sound."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"Going with that big--"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Since U2, that's become, like, a type of--"
01:45:33;01:45:36;"I mean, even some Coldplay, but Coldplay's not so raw."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"I don't know."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"The first thing I thought of is, like--"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Well, 'cause ""Kings of Leon,"" they're, like, a rock band,"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"but they had this moment where they came out"
01:45:43;01:45:46;"with slightly more polished, and they really became huge."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Like, don't you remember, like--"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"I can't reach."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"This is a huge song."

01:45:58;01:46:02;"You know that I could use somebody."
01:46:02;01:46:05;"But you'll see, like, when he gets big."
01:46:05;01:46:12;"Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Or as he gets really big."
01:46:17;01:46:24;"You know what I mean?"

01:48:47;01:48:49;"How come they're compared?"

01:48:52;01:48:55;"Kings of Leon came out maybe a couple years after,"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"so they were called almost, like, the, like, Southern Strokes,"

01:49:02;01:49:05;"Because I don't hear anything similar in their sound."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"Their paths diverge."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Early Kings of Leon you could see."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Really?"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"And then Kings of Leon went a little more bigger, epic."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"Anthemic?"
01:49:12;01:49:15;"Yeah, Strokes have never really went for, like, anything epic."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"No."

01:49:35;01:49:38;"Okay, before we even listen to this, I want to explain what it says here."
01:49:38;01:49:41;"Ray Stevens is an American comedian and country singer-songwriter."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"He's considered a novelty artist."
01:49:43;01:49:47;"He always wrote original songs that were based on cultural trends,"
01:49:47;01:49:51;"and in this song, ""The Streak,"" is a response to the cultural phenomenon"
01:49:51;01:49:55;"of streaking in the early '70s, especially in 1974."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"That was the high-water mark for streaking?"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"I guess--well, I guess--I mean, this is after the song came out,"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"but at the 1974 Academy Awards, Robert Opel streaked."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"Wait, so does that mean run naked across the stage?"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"I think that's all it means."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"Streaking is running naked."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"Hello, everyone."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"This is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation"

01:50:20;01:50:21;"Yeah, I did."
01:50:21;01:50:24;"I was standing over there by the tomatoes, and here he comes,"
01:50:24;01:50:27;"running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables,"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"naked as a jaybird."
01:50:28;01:50:31;"And I hollered over to Ethel, I said, ""Don't look, Ethel!"""
01:50:31;01:50:32;"And it's too late."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"She'd already been in the scene."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"Here he comes."
01:50:35;01:50:36;"Boogity, boogity."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"There he goes."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Boogity, boogity."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"And he ain't wearing no clothes."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"Oh, yes, they call him the streak."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"Boogity, boogity."
01:50:45;01:50:48;"Fastest thing on two feet."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Boogity, boogity."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"He's just as proud as he can be."
01:50:51;01:50:57;"For his anatomy, he's going to give us a peek."
01:50:57;01:51:00;"Some built-in laughs."
01:51:00;01:51:01;"Boogity, boogity."
01:51:01;01:51:04;"He likes to show off his physique."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"Boogity, boogity."
01:51:05;01:51:09;"If there's an audience to be found, you'll be streaking around,"
01:51:09;01:51:12;"inviting public critique."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"This is your action news reporter once again,"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"and we're here at the gas station."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?"
01:51:18;01:51:19;"Yeah, I did."
01:51:19;01:51:22;"I was just in here getting my cars checked."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"He just appeared out of the traffic."
01:51:24;01:51:27;"He comes streaking around the grease rack there."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"I've never heard this in my life."
01:51:29;01:51:31;"I've heard of Ray Stevens."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Yeah, the name sounds familiar."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Don't look, Ethel!"
01:51:34;01:51:35;"And it's too late."
01:51:35;01:51:38;"She'd already been moved."
01:51:38;01:51:43;"Flash, the rock star in front of the shop was sold."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"I feel like we talked about novelty songs last week."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Right, I felt like there weren't as many lately."
01:51:49;01:51:53;"Didn't you listen to that weird one about those sounds that the--"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"What does the fox say?"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Right."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"[imitates fox sounds]"
01:51:57;01:52:00;"All right, the Ray Stevens with the streak."
01:52:00;01:52:05;"It's so funny to think of streaking as a hot phenomenon."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"What the hell?"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"Like at baseball games and stuff, people would be like--"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"I feel like it was more like a college thing,"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"like people would run around at a college naked."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"That's not really like a news item."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"I bet people were streaking at baseball games."
01:52:17;01:52:22;"Some weird hippie just running across the outfield."
01:52:22;01:52:27;"The number one song currently on iTunes--this is a weird one."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"It's ""Weezer."""
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Oh, wow."
01:52:30;01:52:33;"But it's a cover of Toto's Africa."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"Oh, I saw that this happened."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Toto's Africa has become like a meme."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"Oh, really?"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"Okay, yeah, I wondered why ""Weezer""--I saw that they covered Africa,"
01:52:41;01:52:44;"and I didn't click on the article, and I was like, that's weird."
01:52:44;01:52:47;"I don't really know or care why it became a meme."
01:52:47;01:52:51;"It just became this thing that people became obsessed with Africa by Toto"
01:52:51;01:52:54;"and making memes about it and I guess enjoying it"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"but also finding it kind of funny."
01:52:56;01:52:57;"Pretty disrespectful if you ask me."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"So Rivers cashed in."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"So Rivers cashed in, and he said,"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"""If anybody's going to cover the meme song of the moment,"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"it's going to be 'Weezer.'"""
01:53:04;01:53:05;"And he dropped this."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Kind of updating the song."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"A little bit."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"It's pretty--the drumming is different."
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Different drum sound."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"Makes the vocals kind of low."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"I like how chill the vocals are."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Pat Wilson on drums."
01:54:28;01:54:31;"Weezer went in a weird direction."
01:54:31;01:54:34;"That's one of those bands that sort of didn't need to be together"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"for 20-something years."
01:54:36;01:54:39;"Well, I mean--"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"I get it."
01:54:40;01:54:43;"It turns into a career, but I'm just saying, like, first three--"
01:54:43;01:54:46;"One thing about Weezer, though, it's like you can't really say"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"that they're one of those bands that should have been thrown in the towel"
01:54:48;01:54:52;"because actually they kept winning over new generations of kind of young people."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"So even after their kind of classic early albums,"
01:54:55;01:54:58;"it's not like they were just hanging around for no reason."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"They have a very significant audience,"
01:54:59;01:55:03;"and they've always had--every album has, like, singles."
01:55:03;01:55:07;"Whether it has the emotional resonance for some listeners as the early stuff,"
01:55:07;01:55:11;"of course, that's perspective, but they always had, like, big songs."
01:55:11;01:55:18;"[singing]"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"I don't know that one."
01:55:20;01:55:26;"[singing]"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"That's on Bytes."
01:55:28;01:55:31;"This one I really was like, ""I'm out."""
01:55:31;01:55:34;"Although at the same time, though, they have put out some weird records."
01:55:34;01:55:37;"Like, there was that--maybe, like, Red record that I listened to once,"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"and it was like--"
01:55:38;01:55:39;"That's the one that had--"
01:55:39;01:55:45;"[singing]"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"Yeah, he never chose to make another Pinkerton,"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"but you also got to remember from his perspective,"
01:55:49;01:55:52;"even though that album became, like, a classic for some people,"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"at the time it was seen as a flop."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"That's got to hurt."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"I don't know."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"It's another damn thing, and he's always come across"
01:55:58;01:56:01;"as a very interesting guy in his interviews to me"
01:56:01;01:56:04;"because he really, like, studies song craft."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"So he's on his own trip."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"You got to give it up to him."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"Yeah."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"Beverly Hills is not my favorite of their songs,"
01:56:08;01:56:12;"but I will say that every time I drive or walk into Beverly Hills,"
01:56:12;01:56:15;"which is--there's a lot of signage to let you know"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"that you're entering Beverly Hills,"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"and there's a lot of places like Beverly Hills Hotel,"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"things of that nature."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"You go in your head."
01:56:23;01:56:26;"[singing]"
01:56:26;01:56:30;"I always do Beverly Hills, Century City,"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"everything's so nice and pretty,"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"and all the people look the same."
01:56:35;01:56:38;"Don't they know they're so damn lame."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"Wait, what's that from?"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"Circle Jerks."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"Oh."
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Deep."
01:56:43;01:56:44;"What's the song?"
01:56:44;01:56:45;"It's called Beverly Hills."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Circle Jerks are cool."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"Maybe we go out with Circle Jerks."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"Circle Jerks?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"All right, why not?"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"Circle Jerks, cool punk band."
01:56:53;01:56:55;"The way I first learned about Circle Jerks"
01:56:55;01:56:58;"is because when I was kind of like a tween, early teen,"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"I was introduced to them because they were in my favorite movie,"
01:57:00;01:57:03;"one of my favorite movies of all time, which is Repo Man."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:57:05;01:57:09;"A popcorn classic."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"That's for the Greg heads out there."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"Yep."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Three bags of popcorn."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"I give Repo Man five bags of popcorn,"
01:57:17;01:57:20;"and I'll throw in a Circle Jerks 45."
01:57:20;01:57:22;"All right, well, that was a hell of a show."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"I think we really crushed this one,"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"although I never know because sometimes I walk off the court"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"feeling like we didn't bring our best,"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"and then I hear a few days later from one of our loyal listeners"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"saying, ""You know what, guys?"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"""That was one of your best shows ever."""
01:57:33;01:57:37;"It's hard to say, but thank you so much to Alanis Morissette."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"That was big."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"Time Crisis, we go from zero to 100."
01:57:40;01:57:43;"Some episodes, it could be me and Jake just shooting the [bleep]."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"Some episodes, you're going to get a stone-cold legend"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"like Alanis Morissette, so thank you so much for calling in."
01:57:47;01:57:50;"Oh, and by the way, we're about to announce the winners"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"of the 8-Minute Cape Cod shirts,"
01:57:52;01:57:56;"so check Twitter @TimeCrisis2000 to see if you won"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"these gorgeous tie-dye t-shirts."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Shout-out to Seinfeld 2000."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"See you guys in Ojai."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"Oh, yeah, check out the Ojai show."
01:58:02;01:58:04;"Actually, I don't even want to look."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"I wonder if it blew out or if there's still some tickets left."
01:58:07;01:58:11;"Either way, if it did blow out, you can just come hang in the town."
01:58:11;01:58:12;"Hang in the parking lot, dude."
01:58:12;01:58:15;"Oh, yeah, we're going to have a lot of cool t-shirts in Ojai."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"We're going to be selling some sick tees."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"And if there are still tickets, then buy one and come."
01:58:19;01:58:23;"And if you live really far away, we understand if you can't make it."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"All right, let's go out with some circle jerks."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"We'll see you guys in 2 weeks."
01:58:27;01:58:33;"Beverly Hills, Century City, everything's so nice and pretty."
01:58:33;01:58:36;"All the people look the same."
01:58:36;01:58:39;"Don't they know they're so damn lame?"
01:58:39;01:58:45;"There she goes, 3-B-2, Spandex pants, cowboy boots."
01:58:45;01:58:47;"I just don't know what I'm going to do."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"I don't know what I'm going to do."
01:58:49;01:58:52;"Maybe I'll have to move."
01:58:52;01:58:58;"Beverly Hills, Century City, everything's so nice and pretty."
01:58:58;01:59:01;"And all the people, they look the same."
01:59:01;01:59:06;"But don't they know they're so damn lame?"
01:59:06;01:59:11;"3-B-2, Spandex pants, cowboy boots."
01:59:11;01:59:18;"I just don't know what I'm going to do."
01:59:18;01:59:21;"Beverly Hills, Century City."
01:59:21;01:59:28;"You're listening to Time Crisis on BEATS 1."
