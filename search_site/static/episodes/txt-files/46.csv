00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, the first week of summer 2017."
00:05;00:11;"I'll be joined by Jake in the studio, as we discuss the Roger Waters concert we saw a few days ago."
00:11;00:16;"We'll also speak with Mark Schatzker, author of The Dorito Effect,"
00:16;00:23;"as well as Kenny, a Time Crisis listener who's going to bring some youthful enthusiasm to the program."
00:23;00:27;"All this, plus the top ten songs of the summer."
00:27;00:33;"Mask off, this is Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:33;00:37;"B-B-B-Beasts 1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"You were a friend, rubbing me, on my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:20;01:36;"Ch-ch-o-ch-ch-o-ch"
01:36;01:39;"In the summertime, when the weather is high"
01:39;01:42;"You can stretch right up and brush the sky"
01:42;01:48;"When the weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your mind"
01:48;01:54;"Have a drink, have a drive, go out and see what you can find"
01:54;01:57;"If a daddy's rich, take her out for a meal"
01:57;02:00;"If a daddy's poor, just do what you feel"
02:00;02:06;"Speed along the lane, you can dine or return at twenty-five"
02:06;02:11;"When the sun goes down, you can make it big or good or not late by"
02:11;02:14;"We're not great people, we're not dirty, we're not mean"
02:14;02:17;"We love everybody, but we do as we please"
02:17;02:19;"At least when the weather's fine, we go fishin'"
02:19;02:23;"or go swimmin' in the sea."
02:23;02:25;"We're always happy, life's for livin',"
02:25;02:28;"yeah, that's our philosophy."
02:28;02:30;"Sing along with us."
02:30;02:32;"[HUMS]"
02:32;02:32;"[HUMS]"
02:32;02:35;"Yeah, we're hap-happy."
02:35;02:36;"[HUMS]"
02:46;02:48;"[HUMS]"
02:48;03:06;"When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time."
03:06;03:08;"Bring your bottle, wear your black coats,"
03:08;03:09;"it'll soon be summertime."
03:09;03:11;"And we'll sing again."
03:11;03:15;"We go drivin', or maybe we'll settle down."
03:15;03:16;"It's just rich, it's just nice."
03:16;03:19;"Bring your friends, and we'll all go into town."
03:19;03:22;"Time Crisis, we're back."
03:22;03:24;"I'm here in Los Angeles with Jake Longstreth."
03:24;03:25;"What's up, Jake?"
03:25;03:27;"Hey."
03:27;03:28;"It's officially summer 2017."
03:28;03:29;"Can you believe it?"
03:29;03:31;"Sort of, yeah."
03:31;03:32;"Seems about right."
03:32;03:33;"Yeah."
03:33;03:34;"Well, I mean, the year's flying by."
03:34;03:37;"But it's been so hot recently that it's like, OK, yeah,"
03:37;03:38;"it's summer."
03:38;03:39;"It is hot."
03:39;03:40;"It's been scorchin'."
03:40;03:42;"Don't appreciate that."
03:42;03:44;"I don't have AC in my studio."
03:44;03:45;"In your painting studio?"
03:45;03:50;"Yeah, so I'm working shirtless, wearing shorts all day."
03:50;03:52;"Just like dripping in sweat?"
03:52;03:53;"Not dripping."
03:53;03:54;"I got some fans going."
03:54;03:57;"Do you do like a wet paper towel on your back and your neck?"
03:57;03:57;"Sometimes."
03:57;04:00;"I'll go into the bathroom and just like splash water"
04:00;04:02;"on my face and like wet my hair down and just do the full--"
04:02;04:05;"That's not bad for your painting materials"
04:05;04:07;"and the paintings themselves."
04:07;04:07;"Oh, in the heat?"
04:07;04:08;"In the heat, yeah."
04:08;04:11;"The paint does dry a little faster, I do notice."
04:11;04:13;"Oh, so it's a positive thing."
04:13;04:15;"Well, depends what you're doing."
04:15;04:15;"Right."
04:15;04:17;"Oh, it wouldn't be good for oil painting."
04:17;04:20;"If you're trying to blend a big sky area,"
04:20;04:22;"you're a little more into the gun."
04:22;04:25;"I'm trying to create an even gradient with oil paint"
04:25;04:28;"over like a 12 square foot area."
04:28;04:29;"I got to hustle."
04:29;04:32;"Right, maybe save those pieces for winter."
04:32;04:33;"Got to do them now, dude."
04:33;04:34;"Right."
04:34;04:35;"Deadlines."
04:35;04:37;"You're just like, OK."
04:37;04:40;"No, these are the things that you"
04:40;04:42;"don't get to talk to a painter every day"
04:42;04:44;"about their actual craft, you know?"
04:44;04:47;"You see all these paintings hanging everywhere in museums"
04:47;04:48;"and this and that."
04:48;04:49;"You never think about the--"
04:49;04:50;"It's a physical object."
04:50;04:53;"You got to like take raw materials and--"
04:53;04:54;"This is a random question."
04:54;04:55;"OK."
04:55;04:58;"I was at a makeup artist's birthday party recently."
04:58;04:58;"Cool."
04:58;05:00;"Got me thinking about makeup."
05:00;05:03;"Do you feel any kinship-- and also hearing you talking"
05:03;05:04;"about blending gradients--"
05:04;05:07;"do you feel any kinship with makeup artists or just people"
05:07;05:09;"who take makeup seriously?"
05:09;05:11;"I can see it."
05:11;05:13;"Because you know this is a big thing now, contouring."
05:13;05:15;"What's that?"
05:15;05:16;"It's a way of putting on makeup that I"
05:16;05:19;"think can make the shape of your face look a little different"
05:19;05:22;"or create the illusion of shadow."
05:22;05:23;"Don't quote me on this."
05:23;05:23;"Whatever."
05:23;05:25;"It's like advanced makeup study."
05:25;05:27;"But at a certain point, it is painting."
05:27;05:29;"Yeah, absolutely."
05:29;05:31;"I mean, yeah, I guess you're trying to create dynamics"
05:31;05:32;"and depth."
05:32;05:33;"Yeah, exactly."
05:33;05:34;"Or shift the palette."
05:34;05:37;"I mean, and then you get to like the real crazy stuff"
05:37;05:41;"where somebody could make it look like they're a cat"
05:41;05:43;"or look like they have a wound or something."
05:43;05:44;"And then you really--"
05:44;05:46;"is it makeup or is it painting?"
05:46;05:47;"It's body painting."
05:47;05:51;"Speaking of makeup and painting, who"
05:51;05:53;"did we see this week at the Pink Floyd show"
05:53;05:55;"sitting in front of us?"
05:55;05:56;"Marilyn Manson."
05:56;05:56;"Right."
05:56;05:58;"At the Roger Waters show."
05:58;05:59;"Without makeup."
05:59;06:00;"Without makeup, although--"
06:00;06:02;"He might have had some sort of foundation on."
06:02;06:04;"Yeah, maybe he had some foundation."
06:04;06:05;"Or maybe he is just like--"
06:05;06:07;"Very even tone on his skin."
06:07;06:11;"Maybe he's just one of those lucky people with even--"
06:11;06:13;"Very light skin, yeah."
06:13;06:15;"Very, very white."
06:15;06:16;"He doesn't go outside at all."
06:16;06:17;"Honestly, that's possible."
06:17;06:18;"He could be nocturnal."
06:18;06:19;"[MUSIC - ROGER WATERS, ""HEY, YOU""]"
06:19;06:21;"(SINGING) What do you see?"
06:21;06:24;"Something beautiful, something free."
06:24;06:28;"Hey, you, are you dynamic made?"
06:28;06:31;"Get in with me, it's made of dynamic glee."
06:31;06:35;"Hey, you, what do you see?"
06:35;06:38;"Something beautiful, something free."
06:38;06:41;"Hey, you, are you dynamic made?"
06:41;06:45;"Get in with me, it's made of dynamic glee."
06:45;06:48;"The beautiful people, the beautiful people."
06:48;06:51;"The beautiful people, the beautiful people."
06:51;06:55;"The beautiful people, the beautiful people."
06:58;06:59;"So let's talk about it."
06:59;07:02;"I mean, I lucked into some tickets to Roger Waters"
07:02;07:03;"at Staples Center."
07:03;07:05;"I'm not the biggest fan."
07:05;07:07;"But I thought I was on that side of town."
07:07;07:11;"I thought, why not roll down with our other buddy, Ariel."
07:11;07:12;"We had an extra ticket."
07:12;07:14;"So the first person I thought of, Roger Waters,"
07:14;07:18;"I definitely associate with a tasteful palate of '70s rock."
07:18;07:20;"Not so tasteful."
07:20;07:21;"The less than tasteful side of--"
07:21;07:22;"Dude, this is crazy."
07:22;07:25;"I have Doritos powder in my eye."
07:25;07:27;"Oh, because you're from the spicy--"
07:27;07:28;"I think so, dude."
07:28;07:29;"--spicy nacho?"
07:29;07:30;"I think I do."
07:30;07:31;"Oh, man, that's crazy."
07:31;07:33;"Yeah, so we have some Doritos in the studio."
07:34;07:34;"Oh, really?"
07:34;07:36;"We've got a medical emergency here."
07:36;07:37;"You've got to flush your eye."
07:37;07:39;"[BLEEP]"
07:39;07:45;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
07:48;07:52;"Holy [BLEEP]"
07:52;07:52;"I think I'm good."
07:52;07:53;"Or it's salsa."
07:53;07:54;"Maybe I got some salsa in my eye."
07:54;07:56;"Something."
07:56;07:56;"Oh, yeah, just--"
07:56;07:57;"It's passing."
07:57;07:59;"--people listening at home, Jake was crushing a burrito"
07:59;08:01;"before the show started."
08:01;08:04;"Is my eye all red and inflamed?"
08:04;08:04;"It's not crazy."
08:04;08:06;"It's getting better."
08:06;08:08;"I mean, this is a good teachable moment."
08:08;08:10;"If you're eating Doritos, especially--"
08:10;08:11;"Oh."
08:11;08:12;"--spicy-- wait, what are these called?"
08:12;08:14;"Spicy nacho."
08:14;08:15;"Really got to be careful."
08:15;08:16;"Cool Ranch--"
08:16;08:17;"That's a first for me."
08:17;08:19;"--Cool Ranch in the eye, no big deal."
08:19;08:22;"Spicy nacho, going to take you down."
08:22;08:24;"Took me down a peg."
08:24;08:26;"You feeling OK?"
08:26;08:27;"Yeah."
08:27;08:28;"Yeah, we can continue."
08:28;08:29;"OK."
08:29;08:30;"[LAUGHS]"
08:30;08:34;"So back to Roger Waters."
08:34;08:35;"We went to the show."
08:35;08:36;"It was at the Staples Center."
08:36;08:38;"Also, something goes down really easy"
08:38;08:40;"about the name Staples Center."
08:40;08:42;"It's really hilarious to pause for a second"
08:42;08:45;"and be like, the place where the Lakers and the Clippers"
08:45;08:48;"and Roger Waters play in Los Angeles"
08:48;08:51;"is named after an office supply store."
08:51;08:52;"I know."
08:52;08:54;"I mean, LA's just lucky that it was Staples"
08:54;08:57;"that came through with the offer to sponsor, not Office Depot."
08:57;08:58;"Right."
08:58;09:00;"Because imagine just like downtown Los Angeles"
09:00;09:04;"is just like, welcome to Office Depot Arena."
09:04;09:07;"[SIREN]"
09:07;09:08;"Brutal."
09:08;09:09;"But Staples Center, it sounds like a place"
09:09;09:10;"that already existed."
09:10;09:14;"It sounds like Jonathan Staples founded it, you know, 1925."
09:14;09:16;"I remember having that confusion."
09:16;09:18;"I think it was built in around 2000, maybe."
09:18;09:19;"Maybe late '90s."
09:19;09:22;"But I remember hearing the name in the ether"
09:22;09:24;"and being like, oh, that's just named after a guy."
09:24;09:25;"It's like Wrigley Field or something."
09:25;09:27;"It goes down easy, like Wrigley Field or Madison Square"
09:27;09:28;"Garden."
09:28;09:32;"And then I remember driving by and being like, oh, no."
09:32;09:33;"That's Staples."
09:33;09:36;"Because to me, in my mind, I was like, there's no way"
09:36;09:39;"that this arena is named after an office supply superstore."
09:39;09:41;"There's just no way."
09:41;09:44;"And also, you know what also why LA lucked out"
09:44;09:49;"by getting Staples is because Center starts with a sound."
09:49;09:49;"Yeah."
09:49;09:52;"It really sounds like Staples Center."
09:52;09:52;"Yeah."
09:52;09:55;"Versus like, even if it was Staples Arena,"
09:55;09:58;"you might think more about the Staples."
09:58;09:59;"I just always hear it as Staples Center."
09:59;10:03;"You have to wonder if they took that into consideration."
10:03;10:07;"So if like maybe Office Depot is offering more,"
10:07;10:09;"but they're like, you know what, Staples Center sounds better."
10:09;10:12;"They're offering 10% less, but it's"
10:12;10:13;"going to be worth it in the long run"
10:13;10:16;"to take a little less money up front,"
10:16;10:17;"but have a better name."
10:17;10:18;"Because it's the Lakers."
10:18;10:22;"I mean, that's like a classy, legacy brand."
10:22;10:24;"They had to run it by Jack Nicholson."
10:24;10:27;"I have the Lakers playing in Office Depot."
10:27;10:27;"What is it?"
10:27;10:29;"Office Depot Arena?"
10:29;10:30;"I don't know."
10:30;10:32;"I thought the one you had was pretty good."
10:32;10:34;"Welcome to the Office Depot."
10:34;10:35;"Oh, yeah, the Office Depot Arena."
10:35;10:39;"I mean, yeah, it's like you talk about, yeah, LA"
10:39;10:40;"is a stuck up city."
10:40;10:42;"I'm not trying to throw shade."
10:42;10:44;"I'm just saying LA and New York are stuck up cities."
10:44;10:44;"We all know this."
10:44;10:46;"They're big, rich cities."
10:46;10:50;"Whereas you get a city like New Orleans, great city,"
10:50;10:53;"amazing city, but obviously doesn't"
10:53;10:55;"have the kind of money flowing through New York or LA."
10:55;10:58;"It's had very difficult luck when it comes to Katrina"
10:58;11:00;"and things like that."
11:00;11:02;"Who do they get to sponsor their arena?"
11:02;11:03;"I don't know."
11:03;11:06;"You don't know where the Pelicans play?"
11:06;11:06;"I don't know."
11:06;11:08;"Smoothie King Arena."
11:08;11:10;"Smoothie, as in 7-Eleven?"
11:10;11:11;"No, no, Smoothie King."
11:11;11:13;"You don't know what Smoothie King is?"
11:13;11:17;"Smoothie King is a chain of smoothie places."
11:17;11:19;"Regional chain?"
11:19;11:21;"I'm pretty tapped in, and I've never heard of that."
11:21;11:24;"It's like-- is it regional?"
11:24;11:27;"I feel like there's one at JFK or something."
11:27;11:28;"But anyway, my point is like--"
11:28;11:29;"I hear you."
11:29;11:31;"--that-- yeah, no, I'm just saying--"
11:31;11:33;"Or it's like MetLife Insurance Stadium or something."
11:33;11:37;"Or in like Boise, Idaho is straight up Taco Bell Arena."
11:37;11:39;"Oh, wow."
11:39;11:39;"Obviously, Boise--"
11:39;11:40;"What is that?"
11:40;11:42;"Is it like minor league hockey or something?"
11:42;11:44;"You know, that's a great question,"
11:44;11:46;"because I always talk about Taco Bell Arena,"
11:46;11:48;"and I don't know much about it other than that's"
11:48;11:49;"where like Katy Perry is going to play"
11:49;11:50;"when she comes to Boise."
11:50;11:52;"Taco Bell Arena."
11:52;11:55;"So Taco Bell Arena is a multi-purpose--"
11:55;11:56;"oh, god, this is dark."
11:56;12:00;"Taco Bell Arena, originally BSU Pavilion,"
12:00;12:03;"is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the Western United States--"
12:03;12:05;"all right, Western, you know, come on, Wikipedia--"
12:05;12:09;"on the campus of Boise State University in Boise, Idaho."
12:09;12:11;"The reason I say that this is very dark"
12:11;12:15;"is because presumably, Boise State University"
12:15;12:17;"is a public college."
12:17;12:18;"Like, that's what's happening in America."
12:18;12:22;"A public college has their BSU Pavilion,"
12:22;12:25;"and they have to literally-- a public college"
12:25;12:27;"has to advertise for Taco Bell?"
12:27;12:27;"Brutal."

23:43;23:46;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
23:46;23:50;"[PHONE RINGING]"
23:50;23:51;"Hello."
23:51;23:52;"Hey, how are you doing, Mark?"
23:52;23:53;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
23:53;23:54;"I'm doing great."
23:54;23:55;"How are you guys?"
23:55;23:56;"We're great, man."
23:56;23:59;"We're chowing down on some Doritos Spicy Nacho flavor"
23:59;24:00;"over here."
24:00;24:01;"Excellent."
24:01;24:02;"Working perfectly."
24:02;24:04;"So Mark, you got this book, The Dorito Effect."
24:04;24:05;"Yes."
24:05;24:06;"What's it all about?"
24:06;24:10;"The Dorito Effect is basically what happened to food"
24:10;24:11;"in the last 50 years."
24:11;24:14;"We've been obsessed with kind of what's gone wrong with food,"
24:14;24:16;"and we keep on throwing around theories like we're"
24:16;24:19;"eating too much fat or eating too much carbs."
24:19;24:21;"The one thing no one's ever really talked about is flavor,"
24:21;24:22;"because that's what we all love, right?"
24:22;24:23;"How does it taste?"
24:23;24:28;"So this book looks at how the way food tastes has changed."
24:28;24:31;"And the Dorito Effect, very simply, is what happens when"
24:31;24:35;"real food gets bland and fake food gets super delicious."
24:35;24:38;"The story of Doritos tells us something really important"
24:38;24:40;"about how food changed."
24:40;24:42;"And I'll tell you very quickly how it started."
24:42;24:46;"The VP of sales and marketing for the Frito Chip Company,"
24:46;24:48;"he was working on Madison Avenue in the 1950s."
24:48;24:49;"He was like an ad guy."
24:49;24:51;"And he got hired by the Frito Chip Company to be the VP"
24:51;24:52;"of sales and marketing."
24:52;24:55;"Then they merged with the Lay's Chip Company to become"
24:55;24:57;"Frito Lay."
24:57;25:00;"And he took a trip in the early '60s to California,"
25:00;25:02;"and he tasted a tortilla chip for the first time."
25:02;25:04;"And he thought, ""This is going to be the next big thing."""
25:04;25:06;"So he goes back to Dallas."
25:06;25:09;"He pitches to senior executives on this great new idea,"
25:09;25:10;"and they're like, ""Why would you do that?"
25:10;25:11;"Why do we need tortilla chips?"
25:11;25:12;"We've already got Fritos."
25:12;25:14;"They're kind of the same thing."""
25:14;25:17;"But he was so sure that this would be the next thing,"
25:17;25:19;"he developed it."
25:19;25:22;"He funneled discretionary funds into an off-site facility"
25:22;25:25;"to develop this tortilla chip concept,"
25:25;25:28;"and he presented it again, and he gave it this sort of made-up"
25:28;25:31;"Spanish-sounding name, Mexican-sounding name called Doritos,"
25:31;25:33;"and he got the green light."
25:33;25:35;"And this is when everyone thinks, ""Ah, that's when everything changed."
25:35;25:37;"That's when the world would shift."""
25:37;25:42;"And, in fact, that's not when it shifted because the first Doritos"
25:42;25:47;"that went on sale were just salted tortilla chips,"
25:47;25:48;"and they kind of bombed."
25:48;25:52;"Nobody really wanted them in the Southwest where people knew you"
25:52;25:55;"could dip tortilla chips in salsa or guac."
25:55;25:56;"They liked them."
25:56;26:01;"But the complaint everywhere else was that this snack sounds Mexican,"
26:01;26:03;"but it doesn't taste Mexican."
26:03;26:06;"So this guy, his name was Arch West, had to go and talk to his fellow"
26:06;26:07;"executives again."
26:07;26:08;"He's hauled up in front of them and they're saying,"
26:08;26:10;"""What are you going to do about Doritos?"""
26:10;26:13;"And he said, ""Let's make them taste like taco."""
26:13;26:17;"And this was a seminal moment because before that, you could never--"
26:17;26:21;"that wasn't really possible, but there had been a machine invented"
26:21;26:23;"in the mid-1950s called a gas chromatograph,"
26:23;26:27;"which meant that scientists could finally identify flavor compounds"
26:27;26:28;"in foods."
26:28;26:31;"And as soon as they figured out what made food taste good,"
26:31;26:36;"they started making those flavor compounds in laboratories and in factories."
26:36;26:41;"And that's why in the mid-1960s it became possible to take a tortilla chip"
26:41;26:45;"and give it that sort of savory tang of a taco."
26:45;26:48;"It doesn't taste exactly like a taco, but it has that same kind of"
26:48;26:50;"satisfying zing."
26:50;26:53;"And that is what changed the world."
26:53;26:58;"Taco-flavored Doritos, they were--a tortilla chip that nobody wanted to eat"
26:58;27:02;"became a tortilla chip that people couldn't stop eating."
27:02;27:05;"And this is really important because it tells us something about the power"
27:05;27:10;"of flavor over our brains, of flavor literally to make us eat."
27:10;27:13;"So we walk out there into the world, into diners and buffets"
27:13;27:16;"and the supermarket, and we think, ""I know what I want to eat."""
27:16;27:18;"But the truth is we can't control it."
27:18;27:20;"We're driven by something deeper than that."
27:20;27:23;"And flavor technology was really the gateway."
27:23;27:26;"And it's the Dorito effect because it's not just Doritos."
27:26;27:29;"You see these things everywhere."
27:29;27:31;"Fast-food restaurants use them."
27:31;27:32;"They're in things like yogurt."
27:32;27:33;"They're in kids' foods."
27:33;27:34;"They're in crackers."
27:34;27:35;"They're in pasta sauce."
27:35;27:36;"They're in pizza."
27:36;27:37;"They're everywhere."
27:37;27:41;"And that is how we've created this illusion of deliciousness."
27:41;27:44;"We keep on filling our mouths with food that tastes good"
27:44;27:47;"but just isn't what we should be eating."
27:47;27:50;"And we get into this really messed-up relationship where food tastes good"
27:50;27:55;"in the moment and then we feel awful about it for hours, sometimes days later."
27:55;27:59;"So really Dorito was a pioneer in terms of the flavor industry."
27:59;28:00;"Absolutely."
28:00;28:01;"Yeah, they forged the way."
28:01;28:02;"Absolutely."
28:02;28:04;"So it's kind of a feel-good underdog story."
28:04;28:06;"In a way, yeah."
28:06;28:12;"Doritos comes out, bombs, then they put some weird chemicals on it."
28:12;28:14;"What became of Arch West?"
28:14;28:16;"Arch West, he continued to work for Doritos for a while,"
28:16;28:21;"then I think he did some consulting and he did a lot of volunteer work."
28:21;28:24;"His grandson reached out to me actually after the book came out."
28:24;28:26;"He reached out to me on Facebook and I thought he would have horrible things to say,"
28:26;28:28;"but he's actually a food activist."
28:28;28:32;"He lives in the Bay Area and he was very complimentary about the book."
28:32;28:34;"He said, ""If you're ever down here, let's get together."""
28:34;28:39;"I wonder if Arch West ever had a moment of like, ""What did I unleash, Dr. Frankenstein?"""
28:39;28:42;"I wonder that too."
28:42;28:48;"I mean, because I think he died in the '90s and certainly by then, Doritos were massive."
28:48;28:51;"But by the time they came out with Cool Ranch, that was in the early '80s."
28:51;28:52;"He was way out of the picture."
28:52;28:58;"He's like the Robert Oppenheimer of tortilla chips."
28:58;29:02;"As he first tasted the taco-flavored Dorito chip,"
29:02;29:06;"a line from the Vedic scripture came to mind."
29:06;29:11;"""Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."""
29:11;29:13;"He must have strangled his monster in his crib."
29:13;29:15;"This is a very interesting way to look at things."
29:15;29:18;"We talk a lot about Doritos, but we've never quite had this angle."
29:18;29:20;"So thank you so much, Mark, and everybody, check out the book,"
29:20;29:23;"The Dorito Effect, The Surprising Truth About Food and Flavor."
29:23;29:26;"Mark, what's your favorite type of Doritos?"
29:26;29:28;"Probably the classic nacho cheese."
29:28;29:29;"Love it."
29:29;29:30;"Yeah, hard to argue that."
29:30;29:31;"I'm a traditionalist."
29:31;29:33;"All right, great, Mark. Thanks for calling in."
29:33;29:34;"Thanks for having me on. It's been fun."
29:34;29:35;"Have a good one, man."
29:35;29:36;"You too."
29:44;29:47;"It's summertime"
29:47;29:52;"And living is easy"
29:52;29:55;"Fish are jumping"
29:55;29:59;"And the cotton is high"
29:59;30:03;"Your daddy's rich"
30:03;30:08;"I know your ma, she's good-looking"
30:08;30:12;"Now you're just such a little baby dog"
30:12;30:16;"You cry"
30:16;30:19;"One of these mornings"
30:19;30:24;"You're gonna rise up singing"
30:24;30:27;"Then you'll spread your wings"
30:27;30:31;"And you'll take to the sky"
30:31;30:35;"But 'til that morning"
30:35;30:40;"There ain't nothing's gonna harm you"
30:40;30:47;"You got your daddy and mommy standing by"
31:03;31:07;"Your daddy's rich"
31:07;31:12;"I know your ma, she's good-looking"
31:12;31:16;"Now hush, little baby dog"
31:16;31:20;"You cry"
31:20;31:24;"You're just such a little baby dog"
31:24;31:28;"You cry"
31:28;31:32;"You're just such a little baby dog"
31:32;31:34;"You cry"
31:34;31:35;"Wow, that's a pretty good call, Jake. What do you think?"
31:35;31:37;"Very informative."
31:37;31:41;"Yeah, you know, as I think about it more, I really think there's something to this."
31:41;31:50;"Like, we really do beat ourselves up for wanting to eat, you know, like, gas station food."
31:50;31:52;"But we should probably look at it, like, slightly differently."
31:52;31:58;"You're not a bad person if Twinkies and spicy nacho Doritos catch your eye."
31:58;32:00;"You're just a human being."
32:00;32:08;"If you can figure out a way to surround yourself with more healthful, tasty food options, you know, you might not be worrying about it that much."
32:08;32:09;"Yeah."
32:09;32:14;"I felt pretty bad after when I ate that McFlurry at the Roger Waters concert."
32:14;32:18;"Yeah, and that hot dog you had last night was..."
32:18;32:20;"I felt weird."
32:20;32:24;"Yeah, that food does make you feel bad, but you know what it's like?"
32:24;32:26;"It's like with hot dogs, it's like..."
32:26;32:33;"It's not like when you go to Staples Center or something, they're like, ""We have a super organic sausage option."""
32:33;32:36;"It's like you can force-feed this food."
32:36;32:39;"I'm surprised there's not like a taco stand or something."
32:39;32:41;"Yeah, at least it wasn't open."
32:41;32:43;"There was that Tostitos branded nacho station."
32:43;32:45;"Oh yeah, it sucked."
32:45;32:46;"Remember those nachos that Ariel got?"
32:46;32:48;"Yeah, those nachos were terrible."
32:48;32:50;"This is how bad it is at the Staples Center."
32:50;32:58;"This is where people are paying like hundreds of dollars to see Roger Waters perform the not-so-tasteful stylings of Pink Floyd."
32:58;33:03;"So people are in there like spending crazy money to watch this like cutting-edge laser light show."
33:03;33:04;"Yeah."
33:04;33:14;"And then you walk out, you want to get some nachos, and they hand you this like $10 thing that's like just a bunch of plain Tostitos, a little cheese, and a little pile of jalapenos."
33:14;33:15;"Yeah."
33:15;33:22;"It's like they reduced what could be a great snack to like three whack component parts."
33:22;33:24;"Step it up, Staples Center."
33:24;33:25;"Despicable."

36:04;36:06;"- So you know Jake, we don't wanna talk too much"
36:06;36:08;"about the Roger Waters show."
36:08;36:09;"- Yeah."
36:09;36:11;"- It did spark an interesting dialogue we had via text"
36:11;36:16;"about how much is Roger pulling in on this gigantic tour,"
36:16;36:18;"73 year old man."
36:18;36:18;"- Right."
36:18;36:21;"- Going out on the road for two years."
36:21;36:22;"- That is so deep."
36:22;36:24;"- And you know, really putting a lot of money into the show"
36:24;36:26;"and we were kinda thinking like, you know,"
36:26;36:29;"one level why, seems like he wants to reclaim"
36:29;36:30;"the legacy of Pink Floyd, but you know,"
36:30;36:33;"this is like, you know, he's out there just doing it,"
36:33;36:35;"so we kinda think like, is it for the money, what's it for?"
36:35;36:37;"And that kinda led to a discussion about"
36:37;36:40;"the highest grossing concert tours of all time."
36:40;36:43;"And there's a list on Wikipedia, which is very fascinating."
36:43;36:47;"- Yeah, this was a post-concert,"
36:47;36:50;"everyone's back home text conversation."
36:50;36:52;"- The concert really left us thinking"
36:52;36:54;"how much money does Roger Waters make?"
36:54;36:56;"So I was surprised by this."
36:56;37:01;"The highest grossing concert of all time is U2."
37:01;37:03;"And one might think that the highest grossing concert"
37:03;37:06;"of all time by U2 might be, you know,"
37:06;37:08;"when they're touring Joshua Tree"
37:08;37:11;"or like something really big, but actually,"
37:11;37:13;"all the highest grossing concerts tend to be"
37:13;37:17;"by heritage artists a little bit later in their career."
37:17;37:20;"So the biggest, highest grossing concert of all time"
37:20;37:24;"is the U2 360 tour that took place in 2009."
37:24;37:25;"- How much?"
37:25;37:30;"- The actual gross in 2009 was $736 million."
37:30;37:33;"- Wow."
37:33;37:35;"- And they played 110 shows,"
37:35;37:38;"so that's an average gross of 6.7 million."
37:38;37:40;"How did they get that many people to come out?"
37:40;37:41;"I mean, I know U2's a big band,"
37:41;37:44;"but like, I'm just picturing like 2009,"
37:44;37:47;"U2 is just like every city they're going to,"
37:47;37:49;"they're like filling a football stadium."
37:49;37:52;"- Yeah, like they're playing like Phoenix, Arizona,"
37:52;37:54;"playing to like 45-- - 80K."
37:54;37:55;"No, more, well the average--"
37:55;37:56;"- 80,000?"
37:56;38:00;"- I mean, the average attendance on this tour was 66,000."
38:00;38:02;"- Wow."
38:02;38:03;"- So they're not even talking about playing"
38:03;38:06;"the Taco Bell Arena in Boise."
38:06;38:07;"- They're not playing Boise."
38:07;38:11;"They're going Seattle, maybe Salt Lake City."
38:11;38:13;"They're just doing all NFL stadiums, I guess."
38:13;38:14;"- Yeah."
38:14;38:19;"You know what caught my eye on that list was Bon Jovi, 2013."
38:19;38:24;"They grossed $260 million on their tour."
38:24;38:27;"The name of the tour was Because We Can,"
38:27;38:31;"which is the worst tour title ever."
38:31;38:32;"- Yeah, 'cause I think--"
38:32;38:34;"- It's like, there's no new record."
38:34;38:35;"- Right."
38:35;38:36;"- They haven't had a hit in 20 years or whatever,"
38:36;38:40;"and it's like, Because We Can."
38:40;38:43;"- That's the 19th highest grossing tour of all time."
38:43;38:47;"You know, it's like, I guess there's no huge surprises."
38:47;38:49;"These are the top five highest grossing tours of all time."
38:49;38:50;"Number one, as we said, YouTube."
38:50;38:52;"Number two, The Rolling Stones in 2005."
38:52;38:57;"Number three, Roger Waters in 2010, doing The Wall Live."
38:57;38:59;"This guy just can't keep off the road."
38:59;39:00;"- Yeah."
39:00;39:02;"- I wonder-- - Road dog."
39:02;39:03;"- Yeah, he's a real road dog."
39:03;39:05;"Number four, AC/DC."
39:05;39:06;"- Huh, what year?"
39:06;39:09;"- 2008, it's all like, yeah."
39:09;39:14;"- So even Inflation Adjusted, bands made money in the '80s,"
39:14;39:15;"but-- - Maybe they weren't"
39:15;39:16;"charging the-- - They weren't charging--"
39:16;39:18;"- 1500 VIP."
39:18;39:19;"- Right."
39:19;39:22;"'Cause you know, Def Leppard tours on Hysteria"
39:22;39:26;"for three years, from '87 to '90 or whatever."

40:15;40:19;"The Police Reunion Tour, 2007 to 2008."
40:19;40:20;"I vaguely remember that happening."
40:20;40:22;"- God, that's brutal."
40:22;40:23;"- I just remember being like, oh yeah,"
40:23;40:25;"the police are playing in Madison Square Garden"
40:25;40:27;"or something, I was like, okay."
40:27;40:29;"What I, I didn't realize it was such a big deal."
40:29;40:35;"They played 156 shows and grossed 362 million."
40:35;40:37;"- Wow."
40:37;40:40;"Can you imagine those 156 shows?"
40:40;40:41;"- Well, especially like those guys hate each other."
40:41;40:42;"- Yeah, can you imagine?"
40:42;40:45;"- Just like, Sting not saying a word."

41:07;41:08;"but I've definitely been on tours"
41:08;41:11;"and played some huge shows."
41:11;41:12;"- Yeah, you played some big shows."
41:12;41:15;"And I remember once we did a tour"
41:15;41:18;"that was kind of playing small arenas in the UK."
41:18;41:21;"And you know, Vampire Weekend's not really an arena band."
41:21;41:23;"We've, in the occasional city, we'll like,"
41:23;41:27;"we've done an arena, but our music definitely,"
41:27;41:31;"I think, lends itself most to a kind vibe amphitheater"
41:31;41:32;"in summertime."
41:32;41:32;"- I feel that."
41:32;41:33;"- But whatever, okay, you know,"
41:33;41:35;"we played Barclays Center in New York"
41:35;41:37;"and we played at some of these small arenas in the UK."
41:37;41:38;"So that was the closest thing I ever had,"
41:38;41:40;"taste I ever had to like an arena tour."
41:40;41:43;"And one thing about when you're starting out touring"
41:43;41:44;"and you're like jumping in the van,"
41:44;41:46;"you're driving through wherever you are,"
41:46;41:49;"you're taking in the scenery, you get to the venue,"
41:49;41:51;"there's generally gonna be something idiosyncratic"
41:51;41:54;"about that venue in that city."
41:54;41:56;"You know, if you're playing really small places,"
41:56;41:58;"it might be like, whoa, the, you know,"
41:58;42:00;"the place in Kansas City,"
42:00;42:02;"they give you a token for half off a burrito."
42:02;42:03;"And you like remember that and it's cool."
42:03;42:05;"And like, you, whatever."
42:05;42:06;"And then like in this place, it's like,"
42:06;42:09;"whoa, it's actually this place where it's half inside,"
42:09;42:11;"half, yeah, whatever, there's little things about it."
42:11;42:13;"When you're doing these like arenas,"
42:13;42:17;"it's very easy to get into this Groundhog's Day vibe"
42:17;42:19;"because all arenas are essentially the same."
42:19;42:21;"- It's like a big loading dock."
42:21;42:22;"- It's a big loading dock."
42:22;42:24;"You're not in the center of the city,"
42:24;42:25;"nine times out of 10."
42:25;42:26;"You're out in the hinterlands."
42:26;42:28;"It's not like when you're, you know,"
42:28;42:30;"you're playing downtown Missoula, Montana,"
42:30;42:31;"you can walk out the back of the theater"
42:31;42:33;"and kind of check out the town."
42:33;42:34;"You can't walk anywhere."
42:34;42:37;"- Yeah, there's like, it's just freeways connecting."
42:37;42:39;"And like, there's like a Bed Bath & Beyond,"
42:39;42:42;"like a quarter mile away, you can kind of see."
42:42;42:46;"- Oh man, I got so many memories of just like waking up"
42:46;42:51;"at like 2 p.m. on the bus 'cause I couldn't sleep."
42:51;42:52;"And then, you know, a lot of times that happen,"
42:52;42:54;"I can't sleep on the bus and like I fall asleep"
42:54;42:55;"at like 7 a.m."
42:55;42:58;"Wake up at two, kind of like stumble out,"
42:58;42:59;"you know, in this dark bus."
42:59;43:01;"And then you open the door,"
43:01;43:05;"and it's just like bright, like Tucson sunlight."
43:05;43:07;"(laughing)"
43:07;43:08;"Just like pouring down."
43:08;43:10;"And I like, my hair's all messy,"
43:10;43:11;"and I'm just like, oh,"
43:11;43:14;"and just kind of like walk across like the asphalt"
43:14;43:16;"up the loading dock into the venue"
43:16;43:20;"and just be like, oh, where are we catering?"
43:20;43:20;"- Oh my God."
43:20;43:23;"- Go get a cup of coffee."
43:23;43:24;"- Grind the road, man."
43:24;43:26;"- I'm not looking forward to that aspect"
43:26;43:27;"of getting back on the road."
43:27;43:28;"Although when we were at the show,"
43:28;43:30;"I was kind of like, you know what?"
43:30;43:32;"And also working on the record so much now,"
43:32;43:35;"I am starting to be like, think more."
43:35;43:36;"This is the first album where I've ever like"
43:36;43:38;"been working on an album and been kind of like"
43:38;43:39;"working on a song and be like,"
43:39;43:41;"oh, this one's gonna be fun live."
43:41;43:42;"- Oh, that's cool."
43:42;43:45;"- Yeah, I've been getting kind of excited about like,"
43:45;43:49;"not touring per se, but like making the live show cool."
43:49;43:50;"Like that'll be fun."
43:50;43:53;"You gotta come throw down some tasty licks on tour, Jake."
43:53;43:54;"- Would love to."
43:54;43:56;"- Actually, Jake and I, people might not know"
43:56;43:57;"our backstory."
43:57;43:59;"- Yeah."
43:59;44:02;"- All Time Crisis listeners maybe don't know"
44:02;44:04;"how Jake and I actually met, which was on a tour."
44:04;44:05;"- Yeah."
44:05;44:06;"Dirty Projectors."
44:06;44:08;"- Dirty Projectors."
44:08;44:09;"- Getty Address Tour."
44:09;44:11;"- '05?"
44:11;44:12;"- Yep, 2005."
44:12;44:13;"- 2005."
44:13;44:16;"- Double minivan assault."
44:16;44:18;"- Same year as the Rolling Stones' Bigger Bang Tour."
44:18;44:18;"- You know what's funny?"
44:18;44:21;"If someone was like, in like 2005,"
44:21;44:25;"or was like, okay, in like 12 years,"
44:25;44:27;"you guys are gonna be doing a bi-weekly radio show."
44:27;44:30;"(laughing)"
44:30;44:31;"- On the internet."
44:31;44:36;"Talking mostly about fast food, classic rock,"
44:36;44:37;"I would've been like, okay, that sounds about right."
44:37;44:39;"- Yeah, I guess if somebody had told us"
44:39;44:40;"when we just first met, like kind of"
44:40;44:43;"on this Dirty Projectors tour, touring in minivans,"
44:43;44:46;"playing like punk houses and DIY venues,"
44:46;44:49;"you guys are gonna have a bi-weekly radio show."
44:49;44:51;"I guess I probably would've been like--"
44:51;44:53;"- Based in LA."
44:53;44:54;"- Based in LA, that would've been a shocker."
44:54;44:56;"That part would've been funny."
44:56;45:00;"That's when I would've been like, now I'm very curious."
45:00;45:02;"When we first met, there was no Vampire Weekend."
45:02;45:03;"- Yeah?"
45:03;45:03;"- Not yet."
45:03;45:05;"- Yeah, I remember you sending me,"
45:05;45:10;"like emailing me some demos of like, Oxford comma,"
45:10;45:12;"and like me listening to it on my laptop speakers"
45:12;45:14;"being like, this is pretty good."
45:14;45:15;"And then I remember you were like,"
45:15;45:16;"'cause I was living in San Francisco then,"
45:16;45:18;"and you were like, oh dude, we're gonna come out"
45:18;45:22;"this summer, like hook us up with like a backyard show,"
45:22;45:25;"or like put us on a bill with like some cool band,"
45:25;45:27;"and I was like, yeah, I could swing that."
45:27;45:29;"And then like a few months later, you were like,"
45:29;45:30;"we got it covered, dude."
45:30;45:33;"(laughing)"
45:33;45:35;"It was crazy."

48:38;48:42;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
48:42;48:45;"- Okay, Jake, it's time to talk to Kenny Tulecki,"
48:45;48:47;"a loyal Time Crisis listener who wrote in"
48:47;48:50;"and said that we could talk to them"
48:50;48:53;"about what teens are listening to."
48:53;48:55;"- Well, yeah, I remember Kenny said"
48:55;48:58;"that the show lacked valid youth viewpoints."
48:58;49:01;"- Fair enough, 'cause I know I'm on here a lot."
49:01;49:05;"A classic Time Crisis trope is me saying to Jake,"
49:05;49:08;"that the youth of America don't appreciate"
49:08;49:11;"the tasteful palate of '70s rock."
49:11;49:12;"But maybe I'm wrong."
49:12;49:14;"Maybe they're not all just listening to Chain Smokers."
49:14;49:16;"So Kenny's gonna drop some knowledge on us now."
49:16;49:18;"- How old is Kenny?"
49:18;49:20;"- Not sure, we'll find out."
49:20;49:23;"- Now let's go into the Time Crisis Hotline."
49:23;49:26;"(phone ringing)"
49:26;49:28;"- Yo, homie."
49:28;49:30;"- Kenny, what's up?"
49:30;49:32;"- What's up, my guys?"
49:32;49:35;"- We're just here recording Time Crisis."
49:35;49:38;"We really appreciate you calling in."
49:38;49:40;"So where are you calling from, Kenny?"
49:40;49:42;"- Costa Mesa, California."
49:42;49:44;"- How old are you, Kenny, and what grade are you in?"
49:44;49:47;"- 14 and a half, going into ninth grade."
49:47;49:48;"- So is that fair to say"
49:48;49:49;"you're officially a high school student now?"
49:49;49:50;"- Nope."
49:50;49:52;"- No, not yet?"
49:52;49:53;"- I'm not in high school."
49:53;49:54;"- Oh, you're a middle school student."
49:54;49:55;"- You're finishing eighth grade."
49:55;49:59;"- I finished eighth grade and I didn't go to graduation."
49:59;50:01;"- Okay, got it."
50:01;50:04;"All right, so Kenny, you just finished eighth grade."
50:04;50:07;"You said the Time Crisis is missing a youth viewpoint."
50:07;50:08;"We agree."
50:08;50:10;"So we wanna talk to you"
50:10;50:11;"about what the youth of America are listening to,"
50:11;50:15;"because I always tell Jake that it's mostly Chain Smokers"
50:15;50:17;"and nobody appreciates the tasteful palate"
50:17;50:19;"of Guided By Voices or the Eagles,"
50:19;50:21;"but is that not true?"
50:21;50:23;"- I love Guided By Voices."
50:23;50:24;"- Okay, so that's interesting,"
50:24;50:27;"because sometimes we're a little harsh on Jake."
50:27;50:30;"We tell him nobody cares about Guided By Voices anymore,"
50:30;50:31;"which is his favorite band,"
50:31;50:33;"but that's encouraging to hear"
50:33;50:36;"that somebody your age cares about GBV."
50:36;50:38;"But are you in the minority at your school?"
50:38;50:41;"- Not even my parents know who Guided By Voices are."
50:41;50:42;"No one knows who Guided By Voices are,"
50:42;50:45;"but Jake talked about them and I trust that guy,"
50:45;50:46;"so I listen to them."
50:46;50:47;"- Respect."
50:47;50:52;"So Kenny, you picked a few songs for us to play."
50:52;50:53;"Can you walk us through them?"
50:53;50:56;"This is a taste of three songs that you think are cool."
50:56;51:00;"- All right, can I start out with Past Eulogy"
51:00;51:03;"or Eulogy by Sophia Nance?"
51:03;51:05;"- Sure."
51:05;51:06;"So who's Sophia Nance?"
51:06;51:07;"I don't think I'm familiar."
51:07;51:12;"- Sophia Nance is a very big Vampire Weekend fan."
51:12;51:14;"She really likes you guys"
51:14;51:17;"and she has been trying to get you on Twitter"
51:17;51:19;"to listen to her new album that she made"
51:19;51:22;"when she was like 16 or 17."
51:22;51:25;"And I feel like you guys should listen to it"
51:25;51:29;"because she pays such high respect towards you."
51:29;51:30;"- Is she local?"
51:30;51:31;"- She's in Texas."

56:01;56:03;"- Okay, what's the last song you picked?"
56:03;56:07;"- ""New Flesh"" by Current Joys, also known as Televisions,"
56:07;56:10;"but for some reason they changed their name."
56:10;56:11;"- Cool."
56:11;56:13;"- There was a band called Television."
56:13;56:15;"- Yeah, maybe they felt like it was too close."
56:15;56:17;"- The band was called Televisions?"
56:17;56:20;"- Yes, with like a dash in the middle of it."
56:20;56:21;"- Sounds cool."
56:21;56:24;"- Yeah, Nicholas Gratigan is the person that made it"
56:24;56:26;"and he's really good."
56:26;56:28;"- Where's this band from?"
56:28;56:29;"- Uh, New York."
56:29;56:32;"- How'd you find this?"

58:01;58:03;"- It seems like a lot of your music takes viewers"
58:03;58:04;"towards like independent stuff."
58:04;58:05;"Is that fair to say?"
58:05;58:09;"- I guess, I listen to a lot of different stuff though."
58:09;58:11;"- And at your school,"
58:11;58:13;"are there a lot of Chainsmokers fans?"
58:13;58:15;"What's the climate?"
58:15;58:16;"- The dumbasses at my school"
58:16;58:17;"don't know what they're talking about."
58:17;58:20;"So they really just like don't get it."
58:20;58:22;"And they listen to whatever's on the radio."
58:22;58:25;"Like even if it's a really crappy song,"
58:25;58:27;"they're like, ""Oh, that's really topping it."
58:27;58:29;"""I should probably listen to that"
58:29;58:31;"""'cause I'm a brain dead loser."""
58:31;58:33;"- I guess some things never change."
58:33;58:38;"I think that's the classic dichotomy always"
58:38;58:40;"in middle school and high school."
58:40;58:42;"Like some people are interested in independent music"
58:42;58:44;"and they don't understand what the other people"
58:44;58:46;"are seeing in the radio music and vice versa."
58:46;58:48;"- Sounds like an episode of Freaks and Geeks."
58:48;58:50;"- More or less."
58:50;58:51;"I mean, yeah."
58:51;58:52;"- So that's a yes."
58:52;58:54;"There's a lot of Chainsmokers fans."
58:54;58:56;"- They're not fans, but they like--"
58:56;58:57;"- Okay, I understand what you're saying."
58:57;58:59;"- They don't listen to anything"
58:59;59:01;"except for what's on the radio."
59:01;59:04;"- Now, as a new Guided by Voices fan,"
59:04;59:05;"have you tried turning on any of the kids"
59:05;59:08;"in your school to GBV?"
59:08;59:09;"- I don't talk to any of them."
59:09;59:11;"I try to stay away from them."
59:11;59:11;"- Fair enough."
59:11;59:13;"- Do you talk music with anyone?"
59:13;59:15;"Like maybe friends on the internet?"
59:15;59:18;"- My friend Jackie on the internet,"
59:18;59:21;"my friend Jackie is into the same music as me."
59:21;59:22;"- Cool."
59:22;59:26;"Has getting into Guided by Voices gotten you interested"
59:26;59:28;"in any other '90s indie rock?"
59:30;59:32;"- Well, you said that you liked Fugazi,"
59:32;59:35;"so I started listening to Fugazi."
59:35;59:35;"- Oh, tight."
59:35;59:36;"What do you think of them?"
59:36;59:37;"- They're dope."
59:37;59:40;"- Yeah, that Fugazi spirit is definitely lacking"
59:40;59:42;"in modern music."
59:42;59:45;"So Kenny, I remember when I was around your age,"
59:45;59:47;"I also felt pretty alienated from mainstream music"
59:47;59:51;"or radio music, but is there anything"
59:51;59:54;"in kind of the mainstream radio music that speaks to you?"
59:54;59:56;"Clearly most of it doesn't, which is totally understandable,"
59:56;59:59;"but is there anything that kind of crosses over"
59:59;01:00:01;"where you find maybe common ground?"
01:00:01;01:00:06;"- Yeah, the songs that famous people do"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"with Frank Ocean, Frank Ocean's amazing."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"I love Frank Ocean."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"So whenever they collaborate with him, that's pretty dope."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"And The Weeknd's good too."
01:00:16;01:00:21;"And I like some random songs, just randomly on the radio."
01:00:21;01:00:25;"I listen to the radio a lot, so I just know a lot of music."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Right, so you take it all in."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"You don't love all of it, but yeah, I like The Weeknd too."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"- Of all the stuff we listen to on Time Crisis"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"and when I'm just somewhere and they're just kind of playing"
01:00:34;01:00:39;"pop radio, when I Feel It Coming comes on, that's a good one."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- How about Bieber?"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- Everyone likes Bieber."
01:00:41;01:00:46;"Everyone at my school last year heavily messed with Bieber,"
01:00:46;01:00:50;"but I don't know, he seems like he's doing his own thing"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"and I don't really wanna mess with that."
01:00:53;01:00:57;"But I'll listen to a few of his songs occasionally."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"I don't mess with Diplo though."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- Diplo, are you willing to listen to a Bieber song"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"produced by Diplo?"
01:01:01;01:01:05;"- Possibly, probably not though, 'cause I don't like rats."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"- Fair enough. - Rats?"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- Diplo looks like a rat."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"- Oh, okay, I thought you meant he ratted someone out."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"It is completely-- - Oh, he probably did."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"You know him."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"- I don't."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"- He told the feds."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"- I don't know him."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"- Well, good for you then."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"- Oh, well, Kenny, thanks so much for picking these songs."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"We really appreciate it."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"I know I'm-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"Can you please come to my birthday party?"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"I know that's stupid, but Jason told me"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"that he was gonna ask for me,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"so he told me that I had to ask myself."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- Oh, well, probably not."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"I'm in the studio every single day,"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"but when's your birthday?"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- Shut up, no you are not."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"- I really am. - Saturday."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Saturday, it's a half birthday party"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"because I wanted to throw a party."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- Oh, fair enough."
01:01:49;01:01:53;"- Even if Jake comes with his dog, 'cause I like his dog."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"- Marty's pretty awesome. (laughs)"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- Yeah, Marty's dope."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Marty's a great dog."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"- I love the feed of Marty on Instagram."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- Marty's a very cute dog."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- Kenny, what do you have to do this summer?"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"- Literally nothing, 'cause I hate everyone,"
01:02:07;01:02:10;"and it's hard to do anything."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"But look, I'm just chilling out in Southern California"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"for the entire summer, probably just listening"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"to new albums and stuff."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"- That doesn't sound half bad."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"- Yeah, it's really chill. - Chilling in SoCal,"
01:02:21;01:02:22;"listening to new music."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Yeah, it's great."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- You just gotta do to chill out."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"That's what summer's all about,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"especially as you're getting ready for high school."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"- Yep."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- All right, well, Kenny, thanks so much"
01:02:31;01:02:32;"for picking these songs."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"We really appreciate you bringing a youthful viewpoint"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"to time crisis, and especially spotlighting"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"some newer music, 'cause I know we go on and on"

01:05:50;01:05:54;"One thing I know is that I want him to win so bad, but I'm not Chicago."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"I'm hard as low, it's real low, it's so low."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"You can't lift me up, I'm like a lotto."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"From the start, it's been real dark."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"It's been so dark, I guess that you could call it charboard."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"I'm playing like Hasbro, I'm really sorry."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"Call me Arto."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"Crash the McLaren, bought me a Tesla."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"I know you're sick of me talking about cars."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"But what the f*** else do you want from me?"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"That is the only thing keeping me company."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"I just bang until I'm annoyed."
01:06:11;01:06:14;"These items just filling the void."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Been feeling it for so long, I don't even know if it's the joy."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Current bad dog, present that dog."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"My partner is a shadow."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"I need love, do you got some I can borrow?"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I can find some in the mall, bro."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"But that never comes, like a vasectomy."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"What have I done?"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"I got the talent to face enough ones for myself."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Long ago, but I haven't found someone."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"Mirror, mirror on the wall."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"The loneliest of them all."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"You but act stupid, do you got another number I could call?"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"Never had a pet."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"I never had a pet."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"I never had a pet."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"There's more fish in the sea, but I never had a goldfish to begin with."
01:06:43;01:06:46;"I never had a dog, so I never been through a b****."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"'Cause I never threw a ball, bitch."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"Treat me like Director Pozner, checking on me some time."
01:06:53;01:06:59;"Ask me how I'm really doing, so I never have to press that 9-1-1."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Kenny from Costa Mesa calling in."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"Dropping some real heat on us."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Three songs."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"Bringing some youthful perspective to time crisis."
01:07:07;01:07:13;"Jake, do you remember the summer between 8th grade and 9th grade for you?"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"Uh, vaguely."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Nothing stands out?"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"I think we took a family trip to Wyoming."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"What do you do in Wyoming? Like a camp?"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Yeah."
01:07:24;01:07:27;"Did some, like, horse riding on some trails."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Uh-huh."
01:07:28;01:07:31;"I think I saved my brother's life that summer."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"Really?"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Yeah, we were, like--"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"By introducing him to Guided By Voices?"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"I wasn't into GBV."
01:07:37;01:07:43;"GBV was just grinding it out in a Dayton, Ohio, basement at that point."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"In obscurity."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"How'd you save Dave's life?"
01:07:46;01:07:51;"We were fishing in a really, like, raging river."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Ooh."
01:07:52;01:07:56;"And he--so I would have been, yeah, what, like 13?"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"He would have been, like, 8."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Okay."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"He fell down. He lost control."
01:08:01;01:08:07;"Like, he was trying to, like, wade through this, like, really, like, intense current in this river, and he fell."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"And he started just getting swept down the river."
01:08:10;01:08:16;"And I just, like, bolted--I could just, like, run down the shoreline of the river really fast"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"and just, like, cut him off and just, like, went into the--that was much bigger."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"13 and 8, that's a huge size."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"Right, so you're big enough that the current couldn't take you."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"Yeah, so I could just, like, plant in--I found, like, a spot where I could plant"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"and I just, like, grabbed him and, like, just, like, pulled him out of the river."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Man."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"My mom was freaking out."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"That's terrifying."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"I think that was that summer."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Right."
01:08:35;01:08:39;"Jerry Garcia's father died in a kind of current situation."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"Whoa."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Young Jerry was there."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"Really?"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Yeah."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"How old was Jerry?"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"He was, like, a little kid, under 10, I believe."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"Jeez."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Man, that's heavy."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Wow, I didn't know you saved Dave's life."
01:08:49;01:08:52;"I mean, it's slightly hyperbolic, to put it that way."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Right, well, that's a pretty good story to have rolling into high school."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"It could have gone south."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Yeah, 8th grade."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"Do you remember that summer?"
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Yeah."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I remember I liked 7th grade."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"I didn't like 8th grade that much."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"8th grade, we moved into the high school building."
01:09:05;01:09:06;"Okay."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"In my school system."
01:09:07;01:09:11;"So, I just remember being in the high school building and, like, 8th grade was just kind"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"of, like, a random bummer year."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"So, before freshman--I can't even--I don't know what I've been doing."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"It's a rough time."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"Kenny seemed to not be relishing it, which I understand."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Very understandable."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Well, yeah, it's--"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"Hang in there, Kenny."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"Yeah, definitely hang in there, especially at that age, like, if you feel alienated,"
01:09:28;01:09:32;"if you feel alienated from the kids at your school, I guess the internet's a positive"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"development."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Yeah."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"I only had, like, kind of AOL chat rooms."
01:09:36;01:09:41;"You weren't going to make any--weren't going to establish too many significant relationships"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"that way, but, like, yeah, it's like when you're still growing up and, like, surrounded"
01:09:44;01:09:49;"by--in a small atmosphere, if you feel alienated from everybody, that can be tough, but--"
01:09:49;01:09:53;"It's so funny, like, when I was in 8th grade, the internet did not exist."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"Full stop."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"It was--"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Like, circa 1990."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"No, it existed."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"Well, not for public usage."
01:09:59;01:10:03;"Yeah, well, very few people had it at home."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"In 1990?"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Yeah, some people had it at home."
01:10:06;01:10:07;"Very few people."
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Okay."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"It wasn't--yeah, you're right, it wasn't--"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"It was not in, like, the common kind of parlance."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"Yeah."
01:10:13;01:10:16;"I want to say '95."
01:10:16;01:10:21;"I went to college in '95, and I feel like it was like, ""Oh, this is this new thing,"
01:10:21;01:10:26;"like, instead of long-distance phone calls that cost a lot of money, we can, like, write"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"to each other."""
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Right, started emailing."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"And that didn't happen."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"I mean, there were some, like, occasional emails, but, like, with my parents, I'm not"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"going to email my parents."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"I'm going to use their calling card to call them."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"Yeah."
01:10:40;01:10:42;"But yeah, I think around then."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Okay."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"It's officially summer."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It's time for the Top 5."
01:10:47;01:10:54;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:10:54;01:11:00;"This week's edition of the Top 5 is really a Top 10, because we're going to look at the"
01:11:00;01:11:04;"Top 10 songs right now on the Billboard charts."
01:11:04;01:11:05;"Not the iTunes charts."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"We're going straight to Billboard, because this is the first week of summer, so we want"
01:11:09;01:11:13;"to see what are the Top 10 songs for the first week of summer 2017."
01:11:13;01:11:16;"So the number 10 song this week--"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"""Body Like a Back Road."""
01:11:18;01:11:21;"No, ""Body Like a Back Road,"" that was more the song of the spring."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Okay."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"This one's by Post Malone."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Do you know who that is, Jake?"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Karl Malone's son?"
01:11:25;01:11:28;"Well, the Malone is a reference to Karl Malone, I believe."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"And like, Posting Up?"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"No, I think Post is his real last name."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Whatever."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"Is he Utah-based?"
01:11:34;01:11:38;"No, I think he's originally from Texas, and I think he's out in LA now."
01:11:38;01:11:41;"He had a big song called ""White Iverson."""
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Kind of kicked things off for him."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"You remember that?"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"No."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"So he's just like a deep basketball dude."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"He's definitely a basketball fan."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"So he has this song, kind of his second big single."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"It's called ""Congratulations,"" featuring Quavo."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"You remember who Quavo is?"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"No."
01:11:56;01:11:59;"He's a rapper, and he's in a rap group."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Okay."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"All right."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Oh, Migos?"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Yeah, hey!"
01:12:03;01:12:04;"Not bad."
01:12:04;01:12:05;"Look at me."

01:14:21;01:14:23;"before--way before he was famous?"
01:14:23;01:14:24;"East Coast?"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Time Crisis crew?"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Exactly, Despot."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"He was talking about Post Malone, like, years ago."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"That was the first time I ever heard him."
01:14:31;01:14:33;"That single was ""Platinum"" in America."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"It's a good name, Post Malone."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Yeah, he's an interesting guy."

01:14:36;01:14:38;"""Platinum,"" what does that mean?"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"It means it sold a million copies."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Really?"
01:14:41;01:14:42;"I'm sure--that probably includes streaming,"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"but you know what it is."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"So it sold 60,000 copies--"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"And got streamed a billion times."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"[laughs]"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"That's crazy."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"Somebody should figure out how much--"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Like, back in the day, you know,"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"to have a ""Platinum"" single's a really big deal."
01:14:55;01:14:56;"I mean, it still is."

01:28:04;01:28:08;"Yeah, like you never got Percocet when you got your wisdom teeth out or something."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Oh, yeah, I'm sure, yeah, or like Vicodin."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"It's like that kind of thing."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Yeah, yeah, and obviously they're incredibly addictive."
01:28:13;01:28:17;"They're very easy to abuse and, yeah, they're ruining people's lives."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"It's weird that, like, that's a thing on the market."
01:28:19;01:28:22;"It's the same chemical compound as, like, heroin."
01:28:22;01:28:27;"But it just seems weird to me that that is a thing that--"

01:28:29;01:28:32;"Government's the biggest drug pushers of all."

01:28:44;01:28:46;"It edges out the Coldplay Chris Martin."
01:28:46;01:28:49;"Yeah, I think it has a touch more pathos."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Oh, for sure."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Yeah, it does a little bit."
01:28:53;01:28:57;"The next song on the Billboard charts right now,"
