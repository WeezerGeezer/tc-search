00:03;00:10;"On today's episode, we'll talk about dirty projectors,"
00:10;00:16;"vampire weekend, burritos, and free will."
00:16;00:21;"All this, plus the top five hits of 1988."
00:21;00:26;"This is a very special, ordered yet random,"
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
00:36;00:42;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:42;00:49;"They were a pale, wobbly leap of my rightful chances"
00:49;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:18;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:18;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:20;01:21;"What's up, gentlemen?"
01:21;01:23;"Hey, what's up?"
01:23;01:24;"Another day, another dollar."
01:24;01:27;"What do you say when people ask you that at work, Seinfeld?"
01:27;01:29;"What's up?"
01:29;01:33;"Or just like, how you doing? You know, just like, kind of empty, passing in the hallway."
01:33;01:38;"If I'm obviously, like, in a lot of stress, or quite busy, I'll go like,"
01:38;01:41;"""I'm just chilling out."" But like, clearly I'm not. The humor is that I'm-"
01:41;01:43;"Ooh, what a passag."
01:43;01:45;"Oh, you mean because you're doing a stressed out voice?"
01:45;01:49;"""Oh, you know me, just chilling. Ha ha ha, oh my god."""
01:49;01:54;"I mean, yeah, you've sort of expressed that better than I do when I do the bit, but-"
01:54;01:56;"Having a great time at work."
01:56;01:58;"Yeah, I don't consider that passive aggressive."
01:58;02:01;"You know what a lot of people say now? ""Live in the dream."""
02:03;02:04;"But that's also sarcastic."
02:04;02:10;"That is so, like, I guess that's just responding to a nothing question with a nothing answer."
02:10;02:11;"Yeah."
02:11;02:12;"""What's up? Live in the dream."""
02:12;02:14;"That's like a sarcastic ""Living the dream."""
02:14;02:16;"I think it's almost like neutral, too."
02:16;02:19;"Like, sometimes you could do a very sarcastic ""Living the dream."""
02:19;02:24;"Like, ""Living the dream."" Or it's just like, ""You know, living the dream."""
02:24;02:28;"And it's like, ""For real?"" And it's like, ""Yeah, I mean, it's okay. I don't know. I'm fine."""
02:28;02:29;"""Yeah, what do you mean? I'm fine."""
02:29;02:30;"""Leave me alone."""
02:30;02:31;"""I'm living the dream."""
02:31;02:35;"You know what I like when you say, ""What's up? Good?"""
02:35;02:37;"Oh, right."
02:37;02:42;"Not to be the grammar police, but I didn't say, ""How are you?"""
02:42;02:50;"It's just like, if the question is so inconsequential that you can't even pay attention to the sentence structure, it's just like..."
02:50;02:54;"It's just the tone of the voice. It's just the mouth sounds."
02:54;02:54;"Yeah."
02:54;02:55;"""No, no, no."""
02:55;02:56;"""No, no."""
02:56;03:00;"I'm still thinking about ""Living the dream."" I'm just like, I can't imagine saying that."
03:00;03:01;"""Living the dream."""
03:01;03:03;"Maybe that's generational."
03:03;03:05;"Have you ever said, ""Living my best life?"""
03:05;03:09;"Oh, yeah. That's kind of like, that's the Millennial Cringe version of ""Living the dream."""
03:09;03:11;"It's Oprah, right? I think it's the Oprah."
03:11;03:13;"I like ""Another day, another dollar."" I think that's..."
03:13;03:15;"Yeah, that feels the most right to me, too."
03:15;03:18;"Yeah, I'm just like, ""What's up? You know, just grinding."""
03:18;03:20;"I also grind."
03:20;03:22;"You know what's up? Just grinding."
03:22;03:22;"On my grind."
03:22;03:26;"Either of you ever wake up and you post on social media..."
03:26;03:27;"All the time."
03:27;03:28;"""Rise and grind."""
03:28;03:29;"Oh, yeah."
03:30;03:31;"""Rise and grind."""
03:31;03:32;"Grindset."
03:32;03:34;"Grindset mindset."
03:34;03:38;"Just walking past somebody in the hallway at your corporate job at 4.30 p.m."
03:38;03:40;"""Hey, man, how's it going? Rise and grind."""
03:40;03:42;"[laughter]"
03:42;03:43;"Okay."
03:43;03:44;"[laughter]"
03:44;03:46;"Wait, Sanfo, let me get a number crunch."
03:46;03:50;"Cool ways to respond to, ""How are you doing?"""
03:50;03:51;"Like, cool little..."
03:51;03:53;"Are you going to ask Chet GPT?"
03:53;03:56;"I think it's going to give me a better answer than Google, so yeah."
03:56;03:58;"""How are you doing?"""
03:58;04:03;"Yeah, like kind of cool, unique ways to respond to, ""How are you doing?"""
04:03;04:05;"Quirky? Should I put the word quirky in there?"
04:05;04:06;"Yeah, probably."
04:06;04:09;"Well, no, is the query, ""What's up?"" or ""How are you doing?"""
04:09;04:11;"I put, ""How are you doing?"" Do you prefer, ""What's up?"""
04:11;04:12;"Let's try both."
04:12;04:14;"All right. Okay, we'll start with, ""What's up?"""
04:14;04:15;"Do we want five?"
04:15;04:17;"What are five? You got to be real specific with it."
04:17;04:18;"Top five."
04:18;04:20;"Okay. All right, here we go."
04:20;04:21;"Coming in at number one."
04:21;04:24;"""The ceiling's up, but my spirits are even higher."""
04:24;04:26;"Ooh, I never heard that one before."
04:26;04:27;"I like that for Jake."
04:27;04:28;"Too wordy."
04:28;04:30;"""The rest are even longer."""
04:30;04:31;"Hmm."
04:31;04:34;"""Not much, just practicing my interpretive dance move"
04:34;04:36;"for the upcoming Squirrel Ballet."""
04:36;04:38;"I think they're taking the word quirky."
04:38;04:39;"Oh, God."
04:39;04:42;"I think this is also Chet GPT trying to, like,"
04:42;04:44;"say something that's never been said before."
04:44;04:47;"I also have to say that I have this distinct memory"
04:47;04:51;"because it was burned into my mind as being so brutal"
04:51;04:54;"whenever this was 20, 25 years ago watching,"
04:54;04:58;"was it on MTV or VH1, it was a show about pickup artists."
04:58;05:00;"There was a guy who was briefly kind of famous or infamous"
05:00;05:02;"named Mystery. He wore a big furry hat."
05:02;05:03;"Hell yeah."
05:03;05:04;"And this was about pickup artists."
05:04;05:08;"And at some point, he's trying to teach all these scrubs"
05:08;05:10;"how to talk to women."
05:10;05:12;"And I remember even at the time thinking, like,"
05:12;05:16;"""Well, these guys are so weird that you're probably,"
05:16;05:19;"by even just forcing them to talk to women,"
05:19;05:22;"you've already increased their chances from 0% to, like,"
05:22;05:24;"whatever, something marginal."""
05:24;05:29;"Anyway, one of the funny pickup lines that they had"
05:29;05:34;"was something like, was like, go to somebody and say,"
05:34;05:35;"""How are you ladies doing tonight?"""
05:35;05:37;"""Good. How are you guys?"""
05:37;05:39;"You know, assuming you get that response."
05:39;05:42;"And then this was burned into my memory."
05:42;05:45;"The answer we're supposed to say is, ""Oh, I'm good."
05:45;05:49;"Me and my boys here, we're planning an Ocean's Eleven-style heist."""
05:49;05:51;"[laughs]"
05:51;05:54;"And maybe there's a way you could just lead with it."
05:54;05:57;"Like, ""Hello? Hi?"
05:57;05:58;"Me and my boys over here,"
05:58;06:02;"we're planning an Ocean's Eleven-style heist tonight."
06:02;06:05;"And we're celebrating beforehand."
06:05;06:07;"Can I buy you a drink?"" Maybe something like that."
06:07;06:08;"[laughs]"
06:08;06:12;"Anyway, I was getting a little bit of that vibe off that."
06:12;06:13;"Right."
06:13;06:15;"I'd be like, ""You're celebrating beforehand?"""
06:15;06:16;"[laughs]"
06:16;06:18;"Okay, maybe I have it wrong."
06:18;06:19;"Maybe I have it wrong."
06:19;06:22;"Maybe you're supposed to go up to somebody and say, ""Hello?"""
06:23;06:24;"""Hello?"
06:24;06:27;"Me and my friends just pulled off"
06:27;06:31;"an Ocean's Eleven-style heist tonight."
06:31;06:32;"And we're celebrating."
06:32;06:34;"Care to join me for a drink?"""
06:34;06:36;"Now you like it?"
06:36;06:37;"I liked it more."
06:37;06:38;"[laughs]"
06:38;06:41;"This must have been right around the time that Ocean's Eleven came out."
06:41;06:43;"I'm assuming it's a lot more fresh and topical."
06:43;06:44;"[laughs]"
06:44;06:49;"I also remember that because I..."
06:49;06:51;"You know how sometimes you just see something dumb on TV"
06:51;06:54;"and you just become obsessed with it?"
06:54;06:57;"I remember trying to make my cousin Asher,"
06:57;07:00;"friend of the show, laugh by talking about it"
07:00;07:04;"and just imagining a guy who kept updating it for every sequel."
07:04;07:07;"And just going, ""Hello."
07:07;07:09;"Ew. What do you want?"""
07:09;07:11;"""Well, me and my boys over there,"
07:11;07:15;"we just pulled off an Ocean's Twelve-style heist."
07:15;07:16;"And we're celebrating."
07:16;07:18;"Care to join us?"""
07:18;07:19;"And of course..."
07:19;07:22;"I'm picturing a guy dressed in cargo shorts and flip-flops."
07:22;07:24;"[laughs]"
07:24;07:27;"Like a Hard Rock Cafe t-shirt."
07:27;07:30;"And he's just sort of like, ""Yeah, we just pulled off an Ocean's Eleven-style heist."
07:30;07:32;"I was the schlub."""
07:32;07:33;"Yeah."
07:33;07:35;"If the dude's schlubby enough, it becomes kind of charming."
07:35;07:37;"I mean, if he's wearing... He has to be wearing a nice suit."
07:37;07:42;"You need to look like you're in that movie"
07:42;07:43;"to really pull that line off."
07:43;07:46;"Even if you're wearing, I don't know, just a button-down."
07:46;07:48;"It's just like, ""What?"""
07:48;07:49;"Oh, no, that's brutal."
07:49;07:53;"It's like the dude who just came from a mid-level data processing job."
07:53;07:56;"Like, the blue button-down shirt tucked into the khakis."
07:56;07:57;"- Yeah. - No, sir."
07:57;07:59;"- No, I think... - Very bloused out."
07:59;08:02;"I think you have to look like sh*t."
08:02;08:04;"- I think that's where I'm... - Yeah."
08:04;08:06;"Either you look like a million bucks or like crap."
08:06;08:07;"Yeah."
08:33;08:37;"You know what's nice about that is that nowadays"
08:37;08:39;"there's like a built-in comeback where the girls can be like,"
08:39;08:43;"""Oh, that's great. We just completed an Ocean's 8 style heist,"""
08:43;08:46;"which was the all-female reboot of Ocean's 11."
08:46;08:48;"- I'm familiar with the reference. - Okay."
08:48;08:50;"- For viewers who may not... - Well, to anybody listening,"
08:50;08:53;"if that happens, which it might,"
08:53;08:55;"you just found your wife."
08:55;08:57;"Beca... [laughs]"
08:57;08:59;"And if that happens,"
08:59;09:02;"we guarantee that Seinfeld will fly out to your wedding..."
09:02;09:04;"- Oh. - ...and give a speech..."
09:04;09:06;"- Officiate. - Officiating,"
09:06;09:09;"because that's that kind of tidbit that's gonna be like,"
09:09;09:13;"""Now, Greg used to be really shy."""
09:13;09:16;"Last person you'd think... He wouldn't even get on the apps."
09:16;09:21;"He was so shy, he couldn't even get on the apps and swipe right."
09:21;09:26;"Last guy you'd think would go up to a complete stranger at a bar"
09:26;09:31;"and tell her that he and his boys pulled off an Ocean's 13 style heist."
09:31;09:36;"But somehow, after listening to his favorite Internet radio show,"
09:36;09:38;"he got up the courage to do it."
09:38;09:42;"And on his first try, Tammy responded,"
09:42;09:46;"""Well, what a coincidence. Me and my girls just pulled off an Ocean's 8 heist."""
09:46;09:49;"And some of you probably have heard that story before."
09:49;09:50;"Some of you are probably hearing it for the first time."
09:50;09:54;"- That's cute. - If that's not love at first sight,"
09:54;09:56;"I don't know what is."
09:56;10:00;"I mean, I'm actually getting choked up imagining this couple"
10:00;10:03;"- that came together that way. - It's beautiful."
10:03;10:05;"You know what else? Just as another note on this,"
10:05;10:11;"you could say, you know, Ocean's franchise..."
10:11;10:15;"Ocean's franchise style heist."
10:15;10:18;"You know, that way you're comprising all the Oceans, including..."
10:18;10:21;"Yeah, because also, what if you're not there with your boys?"
10:21;10:25;"What if you're there with people of all different genders and whatever?"
10:25;10:29;"Well, then everybody's represented, all genders and races."
10:29;10:32;"I told ChatGPT, I said, ""These are too try-hard."
10:32;10:35;"Give me five more casual, cool answers."""
10:35;10:37;"- Wait, sorry, last thing. - Oh, yeah, yeah."
10:37;10:41;"If the girl seems extremely highbrow, you might want to say,"
10:41;10:46;"""Me and my boys over there just pulled off a Rafifi-style heist."""
10:46;10:49;"- I thought you were going to go Thomas Crowde. - I thought Thomas Crowde, too."
10:49;10:53;"No, I'm going even further back. I'm going Criterion Collection."
10:53;10:56;"""Me and my boys just pulled off a Criterion Collection DVD"
10:56;11:00;"exclusive presentation of Rafifi-style heist."""
11:00;11:03;"- Okay. We also... - Where does Italian job fit in?"
11:04;11:07;"Is that kind of a lateral move from Oceans 11?"
11:07;11:09;"You've got to have a good car to really back that up, I feel."
11:09;11:14;"No, I think it's a little more in the Cudi man of taste."
11:14;11:20;"I also just want to say that even though I first became obsessed with this line"
11:20;11:23;"via a show about a pickup artist,"
11:23;11:26;"there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't use it in the office."
11:26;11:30;"Somebody say, ""Hey, Seinfeld, how you doing?"

11:40;11:42;"Want to divvy up the money with me?"""
11:42;11:44;"I'm just kidding."

11:46;11:49;"Okay, but what else did ChatGPT come up with?"
11:49;11:52;"All right, so we're responding to WhatsApp and ChatGPT."
11:52;11:56;"Very cooperative. Of course, here are five more casual and cool responses."
11:56;11:59;"Number one, ""Not too shabby. Just taking it easy. How about you?"""
11:59;12:01;"- That feels like on-brand for Jake. - Oh, not too shabby?"
12:02;12:04;"- Yeah. - I like ""taking it easy."""
12:04;12:06;"- Would you say ""not too shabby""? - No, I wouldn't say that."
12:06;12:08;"It's a little ragtime era, isn't it?"
12:08;12:11;"I'd say, ""Oh, you know, taking it easy."""
12:11;12:13;"Oh, you're going to like this one."
12:13;12:15;"""Just chilling like a villain. What's new with you?"""
12:15;12:17;"- Nope. - Ooh, hate it."
12:17;12:18;"- ""Chilling like a villain""? No? - Can't do it."
12:18;12:21;"Okay. Oh, I like this one."

12:25;12:27;"- Nope. - Come on, Chat."

12:42;12:47;"""Keeping it real."" Can you say the same about yourself?"
12:47;12:50;"- I like ""slightly combative."" - Just hanging out, being honest."

14:57;14:59;"""Earth to Seinfeld."""
14:59;15:03;"""Earth to Seinfeld."""
15:03;15:06;"""Earth to Seinfeld, we're in a meeting here."""
15:06;15:09;"Oh, 'cause you're spaced out. You're literally out to lunch."
15:09;15:11;"You're out to lunch, but then the cadet part is ironic."
15:11;15:14;"- You're not literally out to lunch. - Oh. No, not literally."
15:14;15:16;"- It's like... - You're spaced."
15:16;15:19;"It's like calling someone ""Shirtlock."" It's like, ""No [bleep] Shirtlock."""
15:19;15:22;"I never... This is the first time I'm getting that."
15:22;15:25;"It was just like, I'm a... What's the word?"
15:25;15:28;"A hapless... I don't know how to be an astronaut."
15:28;15:30;"Something new every day."
15:30;15:33;"- Who's a space cadet now? - Yeah."
15:33;15:35;"- All right. - Call somebody a naval cadet."
15:35;15:38;"- What do you mean? - I mean, you're out to sea, brother."
15:38;15:44;"Get your [bleep] head in the game. You're out to sea."
15:44;15:48;"Feeling this again"
15:48;15:56;"Haven't left my bed"
15:56;16:03;"Never brushed my hair"
16:03;16:08;"And if you look me in the eyes"
16:08;16:12;"You'll see that I don't care"
16:13;16:17;"Speaking of living the dream, how about that for a transition?"
16:17;16:23;"- Beautiful. - I heard that there's new Vampire Weekend music out."
16:23;16:26;"- It's true. - I haven't heard a lick yet."
16:26;16:29;"- Now, Jake, that's not true, Jake. - You played me a demo."
16:29;16:32;"- Now, Jake, that's not... Jake, that's not true. - You played me a demo"
16:32;16:36;"in my backyard one night, like two years ago."
16:36;16:39;"- Yeah. I would say even more than two years ago. - Yeah, two and a half years ago."
16:39;16:41;"- Two and a half, yeah. - I was trying to figure it out today. I was like, ""When was that?"""
16:41;16:46;"Yes, that was a long time ago. So, yeah, you probably don't remember anything."
16:46;16:49;"- I don't. - Well, yeah, we dropped two songs this week."
16:49;16:53;"I mean, it's in the last couple of weeks we've announced our album,"
16:53;16:56;"""Only God Was Above Us,"" coming out April 5th."
16:56;17:00;"But we dropped the first two singles. It's become a bit of a tradition"
17:00;17:05;"with Vampire Weekend that we lead with two singles or two songs."
17:05;17:10;"Last album we did Harmony Hall plus ""2021,"" and it was pretty obvious Harmony Hall was the single"
17:10;17:15;"that ""2021"" was kind of like a... - The B-side? - The B-side and a Muse Bush."
17:15;17:19;"This time I truly consider it a double A-side."
17:19;17:23;"And we launched with ""Capricorn"" and ""Gen X Cops."""
17:23;17:27;"And probably some listeners have already heard these songs,"
17:27;17:31;"but we recorded this, we kept Jake in isolation"
17:31;17:35;"so that he could hear them for the first time on air. - That's right."
17:35;17:39;"- Same with ""Seinfeld."" So this is the first song"
17:39;17:42;"we launched with ""Capricorn."""
17:42;17:45;"Can't reach the moon now,"
17:45;17:48;"Can't turn the tide,"
17:48;17:52;"The world looked different"
17:52;17:55;"When God was on your side,"
17:55;17:59;"Who bears the future?"
17:59;18:02;"Do they care why?"
18:02;18:06;"I know you're tired of trying"
18:06;18:10;"For this and clearly you don't have to try"
18:10;18:16;"Capricorn, the year that you were born"
18:16;18:23;"Finished first and the next one was yours"
18:23;18:29;"Too old, dying young, too young to live alone"
18:29;18:36;"Sifting through centuries for moments of your own"
18:36;18:39;"piano solo"
19:05;19:08;"Alone in the world"
19:08;19:11;"But in my pride"
19:11;19:14;"I called out to God"
19:14;19:17;"He didn't have the time"
19:17;19:21;"I'd seen it coming"
19:21;19:24;"It's no surprise"
19:24;19:28;"I know you're tired of trying"
19:28;19:32;"For this and clearly you don't have to try"
19:32;19:38;"Capricorn, the year that you were born"
19:38;19:45;"Finished first and the next one was yours"
19:45;19:52;"Too old, dying young, too young to live alone"
19:52;19:58;"Sifting through centuries for moments of your own"
19:59;20:02;"violin solo"
20:02;20:04;"trumpet solo"
20:04;20:29;"A hundred dollars"
20:31;20:33;"Or someone's die"
20:33;20:36;"I looked for answers that"
20:36;20:39;"They weren't mine to find"
20:39;20:43;"Good days are coming"
20:43;20:46;"Not just to die"
20:46;20:50;"I know you're tired of trying"
20:50;20:54;"For this and clearly you don't have to try"
20:54;21:00;"Capricorn, the year that you were born"
21:01;21:07;"Finished first and the next one was yours"
21:07;21:14;"Too old, dying young, too young to live alone"
21:14;21:20;"Sifting through centuries for moments of your own"
21:20;21:27;"Capricorn, the year that you were born"
21:29;21:34;"Finished first and the next one was yours"
21:34;21:41;"Too old, dying young, too young to live alone"
21:41;21:48;"Sifting through centuries for moments of your own"
21:49;21:50;"Wow."
21:50;21:51;"You remember it?"
21:51;21:52;"At all?"
21:52;21:53;"A little bit. Yeah, the chorus."
21:53;21:54;"Sounds familiar."
21:54;21:55;"A little bit."
21:55;21:57;"I mean, it didn't sound like that."
21:57;21:58;"I don't think."
21:58;22:00;"I mean, yeah, I can't even remember."
22:00;22:01;"It must sound different."
22:01;22:03;"I remember there being that..."
22:03;22:05;"I didn't remember the word Capricorn,"
22:05;22:07;"but I remember there being a hook with that..."
22:07;22:08;"That phrasing?"
22:08;22:09;"Yeah."
22:09;22:12;"Wow. Well, you know me, I'm a... I'm a tone..."
22:12;22:16;"I'm a tone-touching lyricism guy."
22:16;22:17;"Mm-hmm."
22:17;22:20;"You seem to like really pick up on lyrics on a first listen,"
22:20;22:21;"which I do not."
22:21;22:23;"I'm like, I'm a palette guy."
22:23;22:24;"That's what I'm trying to say."
22:24;22:25;"Yeah, I see."
22:25;22:26;"I'm a palette guy."
22:26;22:28;"Well, right off the bat, like,"
22:28;22:32;"this is really interesting for Vampire, especially."
22:32;22:34;"I don't know what the references are."
22:34;22:35;"Hmm."
22:35;22:38;"You play me Harmony Hall, it's got that guitar solo on it."
22:38;22:39;"I'm like, okay."
22:39;22:41;"A little Stones-y, a little like Jerry a little bit."
22:41;22:45;"This is just like, I don't know what the refs are,"
22:45;22:46;"which is exciting."
22:46;22:47;"That's fresh."
22:47;22:48;"A little bit of everything."
22:48;22:49;"Maybe."
22:49;22:53;"Can I say something insightful?"
22:53;22:54;"Sophisticated?"
22:54;22:55;"Yeah, absolutely."
22:55;22:57;"I call it Diane Young reference in that."
22:57;22:58;"Yep."
22:58;23:00;"Yeah, you know what's funny about that?"
23:00;23:03;"When I was like kind of revisiting this song"
23:03;23:04;"as we were mixing and stuff,"
23:04;23:08;"I realized there's sometimes where it sounds more like Diane Young"
23:08;23:10;"and sometimes I'm saying dying young."
23:10;23:12;"But even the way my accent a little bit is,"
23:12;23:15;"if I say Diane, it's like, it's naturally sounds that way."
23:15;23:19;"And I got to say like that's this album"
23:19;23:21;"and we'll talk more about it when the album comes out,"
23:21;23:24;"but it's not very smart ass."
23:24;23:27;"So I like, I appreciate that there's like a layer there,"
23:27;23:29;"but maybe this doesn't matter to the fans,"
23:29;23:31;"but to me in the past,"
23:31;23:34;"that's the type of thing I'd be like looking to insert."
23:34;23:35;"Whereas with this,"
23:35;23:37;"I actually care more about the,"
23:37;23:39;"much more about the primary meaning,"
23:39;23:41;"which is too old for dying."
23:41;23:43;"You know, whatever, somebody caught in the middle."
23:43;23:45;"Too old for dying young."
23:45;23:47;"Too young to live alone."
23:47;23:50;"So yeah, the fact that this old song kind of sneaks in,"
23:50;23:53;"that wasn't top of mind when I was,"
23:53;23:55;"when that line first came out."
23:55;23:57;"But yeah, I'm not mad at it, but yeah."
23:57;24:01;"This is not like Harmony Hall referencing Fingerback."
24:01;24:02;"Well, even that one was complicated"
24:02;24:04;"because Harmony Hall, Fingerback was,"
24:04;24:07;"Harmony Hall was like this idea that pre-existed it."
24:07;24:08;"I just think like, let me think."
24:08;24:09;"I don't know."
24:09;24:11;"Maybe I'll whistle a different tune."
24:11;24:12;"So what was that lyric?"
24:12;24:15;"Too old to die young."
24:15;24:17;"Too old for dying young."
24:17;24:19;"Too young to live alone."
24:19;24:21;"So you're a middle-aged guy."
24:21;24:24;"Yeah. Like you can't check out just yet, but."
24:24;24:26;"You're on a long road."
24:26;24:27;"But also you've been trying too hard."
24:27;24:28;"That was like a major,"
24:28;24:29;"I don't know where that came from."
24:29;24:30;"That was like a major lyric"
24:30;24:33;"and kind of this song becoming a real song."
24:33;24:34;"Like I was like working on this kind of verse"
24:34;24:37;"and I just had this idea that the end of the verse would be like,"
24:37;24:41;"♪ I know you're tired of trying to listen clearly ♪"
24:41;24:43;"♪ You don't have to try ♪"
24:43;24:44;"Like that, I don't know."
24:44;24:47;"I remember that was kind of like an early important part."
24:47;24:49;"Like help me unlock something."
24:49;24:51;"And then you applied that to the mix."
24:51;24:52;"You were just like,"
24:52;24:53;"we're not going to try with this."
24:53;24:54;"We're not going to try it too hard."
24:54;24:55;"We're not going to sweat it."
24:55;24:59;"Just like let the reverb and the boominess just like go."
24:59;25:00;"I mean, in a way."
25:00;25:02;"I, I, that's very bold."
25:02;25:04;"The mixing choices."
25:04;25:05;"Interesting."
25:05;25:06;"I fully sign off on them."
25:06;25:08;"It's just not what you would expect."
25:08;25:11;"Like, oh, there's a new vampire single."
25:11;25:17;"I'm expecting a tight, tidy, uber precise song"
25:17;25:19;"where every detail has been scrutinized."
25:19;25:21;"This feels like, nope."
25:21;25:22;"It's boomy."
25:22;25:24;"It's like this, there's parts where..."
25:24;25:27;"The secret is that this takes just as much scrutiny for us,"
25:27;25:30;"if not more, to make sure we really want it this way."
25:30;25:31;"But yeah, of course, point taken."
25:31;25:33;"Like there were a few songs on this album,"
25:33;25:34;"not just for this one,"
25:34;25:38;"where because things sounded too slick or something,"
25:38;25:41;"we went crazy, especially Arielle."
25:41;25:44;"Trying to put some life into it."
25:44;25:47;"You know, like every album there become these kind of like"
25:47;25:50;"lame or whatever inside jokes."
25:50;25:52;"And one was when we first started working with Arielle"
25:52;25:55;"on Modern Vampires, he had a studio in Burbank."
25:55;26:00;"And down the road from him in Burbank"
26:00;26:05;"was a real old school health food market called Full O' Life."
26:05;26:07;"Like O with apostrophe."
26:07;26:08;"Full O' Life."
26:09;26:11;"And this is..."
26:11;26:13;"You find that so funny, Syphon?"
26:13;26:14;"It's so stupid."
26:14;26:15;"Full O' Life."
26:16;26:18;"And it was like hard to describe."
26:18;26:20;"It's like a very LA thing because there's a long history"
26:20;26:22;"of health food here, which we've touched on on the program"
26:22;26:23;"here and there."
26:23;26:26;"And so this was like, the font was like 50s,"
26:26;26:27;"like a 50s farmers market font."
26:27;26:28;"Full O' Life."
26:28;26:31;"And you get an alfalfa sandwich, you know,"
26:31;26:32;"it was old school health food."
26:32;26:35;"And it didn't survive into the Erewhon."
26:35;26:37;"I mean, Erewhon is old school too,"
26:38;26:40;"but it didn't survive in the Erewhon 2.0 era."
26:40;26:41;"Let's put it that way."
26:41;26:45;"So anyway, that was a place that we'd buy snacks"
26:45;26:46;"at Full O' Life."
26:46;26:49;"And then at some point there was a lot of discussion"
26:49;26:50;"on this album."
26:50;26:52;"Like, even when something sounded cool,"
26:52;26:55;"it'd be like, it's just not Full O' Life."
26:55;26:58;"And you know, it became a shorthand."
26:58;27:00;"And I think we both felt the same way that"
27:00;27:05;"there were sounds that needed to be looser."
27:05;27:07;"And you know what's funny about it too, Jake,"
27:07;27:10;"is that like in the, I know it sounds like"
27:10;27:13;"just like kind of like a good line to say"
27:13;27:15;"it's actually harder to make stuff like that."
27:15;27:18;"In the Pro Tools era, it literally is."
27:18;27:21;"You know, because our music has never been"
27:21;27:23;"just the band rocking, even from our first album."
27:23;27:27;"It's always been a bit, some combo of live playing"
27:27;27:30;"plus making stuff in the way most music is made"
27:30;27:33;"in a digital audio workstation."
27:33;27:37;"And the truth is, as anybody who's ever made music knows,"
27:37;27:40;"whether you're an expert in Pro Tools"
27:40;27:43;"or you're opening up GarageBand for the first time,"
27:43;27:46;"generally speaking, the default mode of making music"
27:46;27:49;"is making stuff to the grid."
27:49;27:52;"And so if you ever want to like,"
27:52;27:56;"and of course you can still have vibe with gridded music,"
27:56;27:58;"but definitely for Arielle it's like"
27:58;28:01;"to not have it be mercilessly gridded"
28:01;28:02;"actually takes more work."
28:02;28:04;"Because that means like really zooming in"
28:04;28:07;"and like getting kind of deep on stuff."
28:07;28:10;"The other song that we dropped"
28:10;28:14;"other side of the single is Gen X Cops."
28:14;28:16;"I told you that we had a song called Gen X Cops, right?"
28:16;28:19;"I don't think you did. Intriguing title."
28:19;28:22;"Named after a late nineties Hong Kong action film."
28:22;28:23;"I didn't know that."
28:23;28:25;"And to a lesser extent, also inspired by its sequel,"
28:25;28:29;"Gen X Cops 2, also known as Gen Y Cops."
28:29;28:33;"Anyway, this is Gen X Cops."
28:33;28:57;"electric guitar solo"
28:57;29:02;"Blackened sky and sharp in the eyes"
29:02;29:08;"Forever cursed to live unrelaxed"
29:08;29:13;"We make no bones, our hearts are not our own"
29:13;29:20;"And home is nowhere we can stay"
29:20;29:25;"Dodge the traffic and dodge the war"
29:25;29:31;"Forever cursed to live in Seattle"
29:31;29:34;"The cutting drops are good"
29:34;29:36;"Gen X Cops is simple"
29:36;29:43;"It's a trembling bit for our human nature"
29:43;29:49;"It wasn't meant for me"
29:49;29:54;"It's your kind of me"
29:54;29:56;"But in my time"
29:56;29:59;"You don't get my message"
29:59;30:02;"It's just a face"
30:02;30:05;"It's all about you"
30:05;30:28;"electric guitar solo"
30:28;30:34;"Welcome back my oldest friend"
30:34;30:39;"Are you cursed to take part again in this?"
30:39;30:41;"You raised me"
30:41;30:44;"Eternally obscene"
30:44;30:51;"Always looking for an absurd DNA trick"
30:51;30:57;"It wasn't meant for me"
30:57;31:02;"It's your kind of me"
31:02;31:04;"But in my time"
31:04;31:07;"You don't get my message"
31:07;31:10;"It's just a face"
31:10;31:13;"It's all about you"
31:13;31:37;"electric guitar solo"
31:37;31:43;"It wasn't meant for me"
31:43;31:47;"It's your kind of me"
31:47;31:49;"But in my time"
31:49;31:53;"You don't get my message"
31:53;31:59;"Each generation makes its own apology"
31:59;32:01;"It's by design"
32:01;32:05;"And consequentially"
32:05;32:10;"Each generation makes its own apology"
32:11;32:13;"I like that ending"
32:13;32:16;"Wow, yeah, it's like"
32:16;32:19;"It's like the master tapes got thrown in the bathtub or something"
32:19;32:22;"Uh oh, it's not supposed to sound that crazy"
32:22;32:23;"I mean, I'd like it"
32:23;32:25;"But I could see someone's mom being like"
32:25;32:27;"I can't hear the words"
32:27;32:30;"Can I ask, is there a little bit of a surf rock?"
32:30;32:32;"Well, the drumming has"
32:32;32:35;"There's a different energy on the drumming"
32:35;32:37;"A lot of sick fills"
32:38;32:40;"A lot of, yeah, like really fun"
32:40;32:42;"I'm not going to say busy"
32:42;32:44;"Because that's sort of a pejorative, but"
32:44;32:45;"They're definitely fast"
32:45;32:46;"Yeah, I love them"
32:46;32:47;"I think it's cool"
32:47;32:50;"I'm excited about this"
32:50;32:52;"This album is definitely a"
32:52;32:54;"Yeah, and I don't, you know, I want people to"
32:54;32:55;"I don't want to go too hard now"
32:55;32:57;"Because I want people, of course, to hear the whole record"
32:57;33:02;"But it's definitely some of our most aggressive tones"
33:02;33:04;"I'm fully supportive of that"
33:04;33:06;"This is what kind of made me think of Harmony Hall"
33:07;33:08;"And the sort of progressive"
33:08;33:11;"There are a lot of different parts to this one"
33:11;33:15;"Compared to the last one you played"
33:15;33:17;"Yeah, I mean, this one like goes through all these different sections"
33:17;33:20;"It's faster, gets to like piano solo"
33:20;33:21;"And then ends"
33:21;33:25;"This one, the original idea goes back like a really long time ago"
33:25;33:28;"Me and CT actually wrote it together"
33:28;33:33;"The verse chorus and the slide riff"
33:33;33:35;"That was a demo that me and CT did"
33:36;33:36;"Who's playing that slide?"
33:36;33:37;"On this recording, it's Ariel"
33:37;33:41;"But originally, CT wrote most of it"
33:41;33:42;"With me chiming in here and there"
33:42;33:45;"On a lap steel back in the New York days"
33:45;33:46;"Oh, wow"
33:46;33:50;"I'm excited to get into the meaning of Gen X Cops"
33:50;33:52;"Maybe at a later date"
33:52;33:53;"Yeah, I think we got to wait"
33:53;33:54;"We do the full album episode"
33:54;33:56;"We got to let it simmer"
33:56;33:58;"Let the people get in first"
33:58;33:59;"Yeah"
33:59;34:03;"Right, we also announced the album release show"
34:04;34:06;"On April 8th in Austin, Texas"
34:06;34:08;"Total Eclipse"
34:08;34:09;"During the day"
34:09;34:12;"We're going to start the show around noon"
34:12;34:14;"Noon 1230 or something"
34:14;34:15;"Play for a bit"
34:15;34:16;"Then the eclipse is going to happen"
34:16;34:18;"A total eclipse"
34:18;34:20;"I think we'll pause out of respect"
34:20;34:21;"For mother nature"
34:21;34:23;"And then finish the set"
34:23;34:24;"It's going to be outdoor"
34:24;34:26;"In this place, the Moody Amphitheater"
34:26;34:28;"A new-ish amphitheater in Austin, Texas"
34:28;34:31;"And I guess we first talked about this show"
34:31;34:32;"Many years ago"
34:33;34:34;"August 27th, 2017"
34:34;34:36;"Episode 50"
34:36;34:38;"I can't believe it was that long ago"
34:38;34:43;"This is from the Time Crisis Wiki account"
34:43;34:44;"Topics"
34:44;34:46;"Cousin Asher and Despot fly out to LA"
34:46;34:48;"To take over co-hosting duties"
34:48;34:50;"Jake calls in from Vermont to chat"
34:50;34:51;"Eclipse watching"
34:51;34:52;"Because I had just been out"
34:52;34:54;"In Casper, Wyoming"
34:54;34:56;"With Hannah and her parents"
34:56;34:58;"Watching the eclipse there"
34:58;35:00;"And then we went to Vermont"
35:01;35:02;"And the crew plans to get together"
35:02;35:04;"For Ezra's 40th birthday"
35:04;35:07;"To watch the next eclipse in 2024"
35:07;35:09;"So this plane was hatched 7 years ago"
35:09;35:11;"You were a young, fresh-faced 32"
35:11;35:13;"At the time, Ezra turning 40"
35:13;35:14;"Felt like so far in the future"
35:14;35:15;"Way in the future"
35:15;35:16;"Yeah"
35:16;35:17;"Well, yeah, and that's the thing"
35:17;35:18;"I'm not"
35:18;35:20;"The show is not to celebrate my birthday"
35:20;35:22;"It kind of is"
35:22;35:23;"No, we'll have a party at night"
35:23;35:25;"To celebrate my birthday"
35:25;35:27;"I mean, the way I've explained it to people"
35:27;35:28;"Is that"
35:28;35:29;"Me insisting"
35:29;35:30;"No"
35:30;35:32;"There's gonna be no reference to my birthday at the show"
35:32;35:33;"So you're not gonna stop down the show"
35:33;35:34;"During the eclipse"
35:34;35:35;"And sing ""Happy Birthday"""
35:35;35:37;"With the whole crowd"
35:37;35:38;"No, I'm gonna specifically say"
35:38;35:40;"I don't want to be surprised with"
35:40;35:41;"A cake"
35:41;35:42;"Or a large tray of cupcakes"
35:42;35:43;"But it is"
35:43;35:44;"Balloons"
35:44;35:45;"The show and the eclipse"
35:45;35:46;"Is on your actual birthday"
35:46;35:48;"Yeah, the way I think of it is"
35:48;35:50;"The reason"
35:50;35:52;"I mean, the reason that I remembered"
35:52;35:53;"That this was happening"
35:53;35:55;"Was because it was my 40th birthday"
35:55;35:56;"You know, otherwise"
35:56;35:58;"I would not have remembered the exact date"
35:58;36:01;"Of the next big total eclipse"
36:01;36:02;"Right"
36:02;36:04;"Going through the US"
36:04;36:07;"And because of when the album was starting to line up"
36:07;36:08;"I kind of remember being like"
36:08;36:09;"There's gonna be this big total eclipse"
36:09;36:10;"It's on my 40th birthday"
36:10;36:12;"Of course I know the date of that"
36:12;36:13;"And like talking with the team"
36:13;36:14;"Saying"
36:14;36:16;"It might be sick to do a show"
36:16;36:18;"So yeah, the way I think about it"
36:18;36:19;"Is for the friends and family"
36:19;36:21;"Like, come to Austin"
36:21;36:24;"Experience a once in a lifetime event"
36:24;36:26;"Jake, you have been in a total eclipse"
36:26;36:27;"But many haven't"
36:27;36:29;"And it might be your only chance in your lifetime"
36:29;36:31;"To see one in Austin, Texas"
36:31;36:32;"Well, during a Vampire Weekend"
36:32;36:33;"During a Vampire Weekend"
36:33;36:34;"That's a once in a lifetime event"
36:34;36:35;"Yeah"
36:35;36:37;"And then we can have a nice barbecue dinner"
36:37;36:39;"Do country karaoke or whatever"
36:39;36:41;"That night"
36:41;36:42;"I love it"
36:42;36:43;"And I don't think"
36:43;36:45;"You know, these things take so long to plan"
36:45;36:47;"Like, to find a"
36:47;36:50;"To look at the path of totality"
36:50;36:51;"Of the eclipse"
36:51;36:52;"And say"
36:52;36:54;"Which cities is it going through"
36:54;36:55;"That have a"
36:55;36:57;"Open air venue"
36:57;36:59;"That we can play"
36:59;37:01;"And also that"
37:01;37:03;"Will probably have good weather"
37:03;37:04;"Because you know"
37:04;37:05;"It's also going through like Burlington, Vermont"
37:05;37:07;"I mean, look"
37:07;37:08;"Knock on wood"
37:08;37:09;"It's great weather in Austin"
37:09;37:10;"But you know"
37:10;37:11;"The further north you go"
37:11;37:13;"The more likely it could be"
37:13;37:15;"Cloudy or whatever"
37:15;37:16;"Wintery"
37:16;37:17;"In early April"
37:17;37:18;"So then, you know"
37:18;37:19;"It takes some planning"
37:19;37:21;"To kind of find it"
37:21;37:23;"And then of course"
37:23;37:24;"You need permission"
37:24;37:25;"And all these things"
37:25;37:26;"To play a venue"
37:26;37:27;"During the day"
37:27;37:28;"And whatever"
37:28;37:29;"So yeah"
37:29;37:30;"I wouldn't have remembered it"
37:30;37:31;"If it wasn't my birthday"
37:31;37:33;"I wouldn't have remembered it early enough"
37:33;37:35;"I could totally see like"
37:35;37:36;"If it was just an eclipse"
37:36;37:37;"Kind of like"
37:37;37:38;"Right now"
37:38;37:39;"Like February"
37:39;37:40;"Being like"
37:40;37:41;"Wait, wait, should we try to do a show?"
37:41;37:42;"And then it being like"
37:42;37:43;"Oh God"
37:43;37:44;"You know"
37:44;37:46;"Luckily I remembered this like a year ago"
37:46;37:47;"Or maybe"
37:47;37:48;"Who knows"
37:48;37:49;"I might have even mentioned it"
37:49;37:51;"To our long time"
37:51;37:52;"Touring dude"
37:52;37:53;"Brian Cross"
37:53;37:54;"And he might have even"
37:54;37:55;"Just had it on his radar for years"
37:55;37:56;"You know what"
37:56;37:58;"April 8th, 2024"
37:58;37:59;"It's gonna be this show"
37:59;38:01;"It's a show on a Monday"
38:01;38:02;"Yeah, that's a bit awkward"
38:02;38:03;"I like it though"
38:03;38:04;"Monday at like"
38:04;38:05;"12.15"
38:05;38:06;"Yep"
38:06;38:07;"Austin"
38:07;38:08;"Let's go"
38:09;38:10;"I'll be there man"
38:10;38:13;"I'll let you touch"
38:13;38:15;"And I'll let you see"
38:15;38:18;"I'll let you taste"
38:18;38:21;"All you feel"
38:21;38:23;"And I'll let you love"
38:23;38:26;"And I'll let you hate"
38:26;38:29;"All you distrust"
38:29;38:31;"All you say"
38:31;38:34;"And I'll let you give"
38:34;38:36;"And I'll let you deal"
38:36;38:39;"And I'll let you buy"
38:39;38:42;"Make, follow or steal"
38:42;38:44;"And I'll let you create"
38:44;38:47;"And I'll let you destroy"
38:47;38:50;"And I'll let you do"
38:50;38:52;"And I'll let you say"
38:52;38:55;"And I'll let you eat"
38:55;38:57;"And everyone you meet"
38:57;39:00;"And I'll let you slight"
39:00;39:02;"And everyone you fight"
39:02;39:05;"And I'll let you smell"
39:05;39:08;"And I'll let you go"
39:08;39:10;"And I'll let you come"
39:10;39:13;"And everything under the sun"
39:13;39:15;"Is in view"
39:15;39:18;"And the sun is a great spot"
39:18;39:22;"On the moon"
39:22;39:26;"Did a quick number crunch and if you're in the path of totality while it's happening"
39:26;39:30;"You could be looking at a range of two to seven minutes of black sky"
39:30;39:31;"Well yeah actually and Jake I know"
39:31;39:32;"Full apocalyptic"
39:32;39:34;"I know you've um"
39:34;39:36;"I know for some listeners they might be like"
39:36;39:38;"Well Jake told us all about that"
39:38;39:41;"The Casper Wyoming eclipse in episode 50"
39:41;39:42;"But given"
39:42;39:43;"What episode are we on right now?"
39:43;39:45;"Given this is episode 208"
39:45;39:46;"Right"
39:46;39:47;"Maybe you can remind us"
39:47;39:49;"Cause even when I've talked about it with people"
39:49;39:50;"I've quoted you a little bit"
39:50;39:52;"I said this is gonna be cool"
39:52;39:55;"Because I know a guy who's in an eclipse once"
39:55;39:57;"And he said he was actually blown away by it"
39:57;39:59;"Is that true?"
39:59;40:00;"Were you blown away?"
40:00;40:01;"Yeah it was not what you expect"
40:01;40:02;"It's not"
40:02;40:03;"The sky doesn't go black"
40:03;40:04;"It has"
40:04;40:06;"It takes on a very kind of uncanny light"
40:06;40:07;"I'll take that"
40:07;40:08;"An uncanny light?"
40:08;40:09;"Yeah"
40:09;40:10;"It's a"
40:10;40:11;"Same thing"
40:11;40:12;"It's almost like you know when like"
40:12;40:14;"Someone's doing like a photo shoot"
40:14;40:16;"And they have one of those like white reflecting boards"
40:16;40:17;"Oh yeah"
40:17;40:18;"And it makes everything evenly lit"
40:18;40:19;"Oh yeah"
40:19;40:20;"And there's no shadows"
40:20;40:21;"Yeah yeah yeah"
40:21;40:22;"It's like if reality"
40:22;40:24;"As far as you can see"
40:24;40:26;"Is just like"
40:26;40:29;"Under one giant white reflecting board"
40:29;40:30;"Where there's like no shadows"
40:30;40:32;"And I remember also the birds"
40:32;40:33;"They stopped"
40:33;40:34;"It was like a movie"
40:34;40:36;"It was like an M. Night Shyamalan film"
40:36;40:37;"The birds were like"
40:37;40:38;"Chirp chirp chirp chirp"
40:38;40:40;"They stopped"
40:40;40:41;"And it became very still"
40:41;40:43;"Does everyone seem two dimensional?"
40:43;40:46;"You mean because of like the white reflecting board?"
40:46;40:47;"Yeah yeah"
40:47;40:48;"Like do you feel like when you see people"
40:48;40:50;"They all look like cardboard cutouts"
40:50;40:52;"I don't know if I'd go that far"
40:52;40:53;"But it is"
40:53;40:55;"It's just kind of an eerie"
40:55;40:56;"Very"
40:56;40:58;"Yeah just"
40:58;41:00;"It's an uncanny light Seinfeld"
41:00;41:02;"It sounds on brand for the music"
41:02;41:04;"That would be performed"
41:04;41:06;"As part of this show"
41:06;41:07;"It feels like the"
41:07;41:08;"What is the"
41:08;41:10;"Like the pathetic fallacy"
41:10;41:12;"It seems like it's on brand"
41:12;41:13;"For the sound"
41:13;41:15;"Of this record"
41:15;41:17;"The direction that it appears to be going in"
41:17;41:18;"Well you know it's funny"
41:19;41:20;"We were talking with"
41:20;41:22;"One of the promoters"
41:22;41:24;"And everybody's getting hyped about the show"
41:24;41:25;"And there was a guy there"
41:25;41:26;"And he said"
41:26;41:28;"And I said yeah it'd be super cool"
41:28;41:31;"I've always wanted to be in a total eclipse"
41:31;41:33;"It's going to be an interesting experience"
41:33;41:35;"And yet another reason to go see this kind of"
41:35;41:37;"Amazing natural event"
41:37;41:38;"And he was like"
41:38;41:39;"And it fits in so well with the album"
41:39;41:40;"And I was like yeah"
41:40;41:41;"I mean you know"
41:41;41:42;"Sure"
41:42;41:45;"You know it's not like"
41:45;41:47;"It's not like there's anything about something like"
41:48;41:49;"Eclipse in Austin"
41:49;41:50;"It's not like well yeah of course"
41:50;41:52;"Because this is"
41:52;41:54;"An outlaw country album"
41:54;41:56;"Where a character called"
41:56;41:58;"The moon"
41:58;41:59;"Wanders into town"
41:59;42:00;"And he is"
42:00;42:02;"Not welcome there"
42:02;42:04;"It's like redheaded strangers"
42:04;42:05;"No anyway yeah"
42:05;42:06;"It's not explicitly like that"
42:06;42:07;"But then actually"
42:07;42:08;"I swear I hadn't thought of this"
42:08;42:09;"The guy said"
42:09;42:10;"Well no I just mean because the album's called"
42:10;42:11;"Only God Was Above Us"
42:11;42:12;"And you're going to have this"
42:12;42:13;"Like kind of like"
42:13;42:14;"Celestial"
42:14;42:15;"Amazing celestial event above"
42:15;42:16;"And I was like"
42:17;42:18;"Oh you're totally right"
42:18;42:20;"And yeah maybe the moody light will"
42:20;42:22;"And actually the place we're playing"
42:22;42:23;"Is called the Moody Amphitheater"
42:23;42:24;"I mean"
42:24;42:25;"It's one of the moodiest"
42:25;42:27;"Amphitheaters in America"
42:27;42:28;"That's hard because there are a lot of"
42:28;42:29;"Moody amphitheaters in the"
42:29;42:31;"In the country I feel"
42:31;42:33;"Yeah especially up in like"
42:33;42:34;"The Rust Belt"
42:34;42:35;"There's some extremely moody"
42:35;42:36;"Amphitheaters"
42:36;42:38;"Northeast some very moody amphitheaters"
42:38;42:40;"But this is the moodiest amphitheater"
42:40;42:41;"In America"
42:41;42:43;"People are also curious"
42:43;42:45;"Because of course Austin"
42:46;42:46;"Has birds"
42:46;42:48;"Like any place in America"
42:48;42:49;"But you know what else it famously has"
42:49;42:51;"Under the bridge"
42:51;42:52;"The bridges"
42:52;42:54;"Barbecue"
42:54;42:55;"No"
42:55;42:56;"They do have barbecue"
42:56;42:57;"I don't know if they have"
42:57;42:58;"Under the bridges"
42:58;42:59;"You know the bridges that cross the"
42:59;43:01;"The river"
43:01;43:02;"I don't know"
43:02;43:03;"What do they have"
43:03;43:04;"Frogs"
43:04;43:05;"They might"
43:05;43:06;"They got a lot of bats"
43:06;43:08;"Austin's a bat town"
43:08;43:10;"You know what"
43:10;43:11;"Yep"
43:11;43:13;"I was in Austin actually in 2017"
43:13;43:15;"And I remember being there"
43:15;43:17;"In the evening and the bats coming out"
43:17;43:19;"We were staying at a hotel"
43:19;43:20;"Right on the river"
43:20;43:21;"And the bats came out"
43:21;43:22;"Yeah I remember that now"
43:22;43:23;"I mean this eclipse is not unlike"
43:23;43:25;"The bat signal in some ways"
43:25;43:27;"And the band is called Vampire Weekend"
43:27;43:30;"Oh my god"
43:30;43:32;"Come my army of bats"
43:32;43:35;"[Laughter]"
43:35;43:38;"Come my army of bats"
43:38;43:42;"As we take over the capital of Texas"
43:42;43:45;"Onwards to the capital building"
43:45;43:48;"[Laughter]"
43:48;43:50;"Fall"
43:50;43:53;"This is the new villain in the Batman universe"
43:53;43:55;"Yeah"
43:55;43:57;"Ezra"
43:57;43:59;"[Laughter]"
43:59;44:01;"My army of bats"
44:01;44:03;"Batman fights a rock star"
44:03;44:05;"[Laughter]"
44:05;44:06;"Some sort of device"
44:06;44:07;"He had to be more like a"
44:07;44:08;"Trent Reznor style rock star"
44:08;44:10;"That Batman has to fight"
44:10;44:11;"Yeah"
44:11;44:13;"He's doing a show in Austin"
44:13;44:14;"During the eclipse"
44:14;44:15;"Yeah this is pretty"
44:15;44:16;"This is pretty Reznor"
44:16;44:17;"This energy"
44:17;44:18;"Yeah"
44:18;44:20;"My army of bats"
44:20;44:22;"But then there's like a"
44:22;44:23;"There's a"
44:23;44:25;"A Texan superhero"
44:25;44:27;"Called the Longhorn"
44:27;44:28;"Nice"
44:28;44:29;"Who comes out"
44:29;44:31;"He's wearing like a Lone Ranger mask"
44:31;44:33;"And then yeah the Trent Reznor"
44:33;44:35;"Dude is like"
44:35;44:37;"What's his friend's name?"
44:37;44:38;"Atticus"
44:38;44:39;"Finch"
44:39;44:40;"No"
44:40;44:41;"Atticus Ross"
44:41;44:42;"Atticus Ross"
44:42;44:43;"Alright"
44:43;44:44;"So that we don't get"
44:44;44:45;"Yeah so we don't get in trouble"
44:45;44:46;"We'll make it"
44:46;44:48;"It'll be Atticus Finch"
44:48;44:49;"So that the real"
44:49;44:50;"Atticus Ross can't say anything"
44:50;44:51;"It's probably public domain now"
44:51;44:53;"Atticus Finch"
44:53;44:54;"Now"
44:54;44:56;"Bring out the Longhorn"
44:56;44:58;"Who we have hogtied"
44:58;45:00;"45 minutes ago"
45:00;45:03;"He is now powerless to stop us"
45:03;45:05;"What do you mean he escaped?"
45:05;45:07;"You're not gonna get away with this partner"
45:07;45:08;"He's like"
45:08;45:10;"How did he get to front of house?"
45:10;45:13;"My trusty six shooter"
45:13;45:16;"Is telling a different story"
45:16;45:18;"Never forget the Alamo"
45:18;45:20;"Yeah"
45:20;45:22;"The stars at night"
45:22;45:24;"Are big and bright"
45:24;45:27;"Deep in the heart of Texas"
45:27;45:28;"That'd be good"
45:28;45:30;"The army of bats come"
45:30;45:32;"And sweep Trent Reznor up"
45:32;45:34;"And fly him to San Antonio"
45:34;45:36;"Where he plans on desecrating the Alamo"
45:36;45:38;"Christopher Nolan are you listening?"
45:38;45:40;"You're keeping in step"
45:40;45:42;"In the line"
45:42;45:44;"Got your chin held high"
45:44;45:46;"And you feel just fine"
45:46;45:48;"'Cause you do"
45:48;45:50;"What you're told"
45:50;45:52;"But inside your heart"
45:52;45:55;"It is black and it's hollow and it's cold"
45:55;45:59;"Just how deep do you believe"
45:59;46:03;"When you bite the hand that feeds"
46:03;46:07;"We chew until it bleeds"
46:07;46:11;"Can you get up off your knees?"
46:11;46:14;"Are you brave enough to see"
46:14;46:17;"Do you wanna change it?"
46:17;46:21;"I assume your guitar can only play a frequency that's heard by bats"
46:21;46:23;"Yeah there has to be some like insanely"
46:23;46:24;"It's a seven string guitar"
46:24;46:26;"It's a modded yeah"
46:26;46:30;"Yeah and when I play the highest fret on the seventh string"
46:30;46:32;"Right when the eclipse"
46:32;46:33;"Right at the time of the eclipse"
46:33;46:35;"It has to be something insanely convoluted"
46:35;46:37;"When the bats are all gonna come out"
46:37;46:38;"Yeah"
46:38;46:40;"And the long horn from long distance"
46:40;46:43;"Is a perfect shot to like pop the seventh string open"
46:43;46:45;"It's like no"
46:45;46:46;"Anyway"
46:46;46:47;"If any of that sounds"
46:47;46:49;"This is gonna be a hell of a concert"
46:49;46:52;"If any of that sounds entertaining to you"
46:52;46:55;"Buy a ticket for the Moody Amphitheater April 8th"
46:55;46:56;"Come on down"
46:57;46:58;"I'll be there"
46:58;46:59;"Seinfeld will be there"
46:59;47:00;"Will be"
47:00;47:01;"Nick will be there"
47:01;47:04;"Seinfeld will be running the dunk tank"
47:04;47:09;"Jake will be judging a pie eating contest"
47:09;47:11;"I'm gonna get on stage with a t-shirt cannon"
47:11;47:13;"I actually like that idea"
47:13;47:14;"I think we should make that happen"
47:14;47:16;"Yeah it'll be a fun set"
47:16;47:17;"I mean this is early days"
47:17;47:18;"So it's gonna be"
47:18;47:20;"And also it's a daytime show"
47:20;47:22;"So I think it's just gonna be a great loose vibe"
47:22;47:24;"You think you're gonna come out and play the album in order"
47:24;47:26;"And then go into some oldies"
47:26;47:27;"Or are you gonna just"
47:27;47:28;"You don't know yet"
47:28;47:31;"I feel like the Webster Hall show"
47:31;47:33;"Didn't you play the album in order"
47:33;47:35;"Webster Hall we did the album in order"
47:35;47:37;"But I don't know if we want to repeat ourselves"
47:37;47:39;"Also again"
47:39;47:41;"Even though it's not a birthday show"
47:41;47:43;"Because it is my birthday"
47:43;47:44;"I might just want to be like"
47:44;47:46;"Loose and fun"
47:46;47:47;"Cool"
47:47;47:49;"Maybe you come up and sing a song Jake"
47:49;47:50;"Yeah I'm down"
47:50;47:51;"I think"
47:51;47:53;"We'll see when we get there"
47:53;47:54;"We have at this point"
47:54;47:56;"We have a very large catalog"
47:56;47:59;"We can see kind of what feels right"
47:59;48:00;"I mean look"
48:00;48:01;"Vampire Weekend show"
48:01;48:02;"You can get some new music"
48:02;48:03;"You can get some greatest hits"
48:03;48:05;"You can get through a few curveballs"
48:05;48:06;"I can guarantee that much"
48:06;48:07;"We got a little while to work on Set List"
48:07;48:09;"I'm excited for your covers on this"
48:09;48:10;"Set List"
48:10;48:11;"I'm not gonna spoil it"
48:11;48:12;"But I have some intel"
48:12;48:14;"There's some good covers in the mix"
48:14;48:16;"There's a few you don't know about either"
48:16;48:18;"Anyway it's all early days for that"
48:18;48:19;"Anyway"
48:19;48:21;"Check out the songs"
48:21;48:22;"Hopefully you already did"
48:22;48:25;"Only God Was Above Us April 5th"
48:25;48:27;"It's a very good album"
48:27;48:29;"Can't wait for you to hear it"
48:29;48:31;"Alright now we're gonna give"
48:31;48:33;"A call to another Longstreth"
48:33;48:35;"Dave Longstreth"
48:35;48:37;"Who's got a very exciting show"
48:37;48:39;"Coming up in Los Angeles"
48:39;48:40;"That we're gonna hear all about"
48:40;48:44;"Now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
48:44;48:49;"These Kinds are good"
48:49;48:51;"I think I bought one of these"
48:51;48:52;"At a coffee shop recently"
48:52;48:53;"And it was like $4"
48:53;48:55;"And I was like"
48:55;48:56;"Four for the"
48:56;48:57;"That explains that"
48:57;48:59;"Two billion dollar evaluation"
48:59;49:01;"I was like four for the Kind bar"
49:02;49:04;"Like mass produced pre-wrapped thing"
49:04;49:05;"Like a Kind bar"
49:05;49:07;"That's just so out of control"
49:07;49:08;"Four"
49:08;49:10;"I mean you can go to Snickers for"
49:10;49:12;"A dollar fifty"
49:12;49:13;"$1.99"
49:13;49:14;"I mean"
49:14;49:15;"Listen"
49:15;49:17;"I'm a high roller"
49:17;49:18;"I buy Snickers"
49:18;49:20;"I don't even look at the price"
49:20;49:25;"You paid $70 for a Snickers"
49:25;49:26;"Hey"
49:26;49:27;"What up Dave"
49:27;49:29;"Hey Ezra how's it going"
49:29;49:30;"Not bad"
49:30;49:31;"Time crisis"
49:31;49:33;"Oh thank you"
49:33;49:34;"$70 for a Snickers bar"
49:34;49:35;"What"
49:35;49:36;"Sorry"
49:36;49:37;"I'm chewing on a Kind bar"
49:37;49:39;"And I was saying"
49:39;49:40;"Recently I was at a coffee shop"
49:40;49:41;"And I bought a Kind bar"
49:41;49:43;"And it was $4"
49:43;49:45;"Outrageous"
49:45;49:47;"Like what's a Snickers run"
49:47;49:49;"I was just saying that"
49:49;49:50;"I'm such a high roller"
49:50;49:51;"I don't even"
49:51;49:52;"You know like"
49:52;49:53;"I buy Snickers"
49:53;49:54;"I don't even look at the price"
49:54;49:55;"Alright"
49:55;49:56;"$1.39"
49:56;49:57;"Yeah"
49:57;49:58;"A dollar thirty nine"
49:58;49:59;"I was gonna guess a dollar fifty"
49:59;50:01;"Yeah for your standard"
50:01;50:02;"Snickers"
50:02;50:03;"I was gonna say yeah like $1.70"
50:03;50:04;"For a Snickers"
50:04;50:05;"But that's amazing"
50:05;50:07;"Because it wasn't that much cheaper"
50:07;50:09;"I mean how cheap could a Snickers"
50:09;50:10;"Have been in 1995"
50:10;50:11;"$0.89"
50:11;50:13;"Yeah totally"
50:13;50:14;"$0.69"
50:14;50:16;"Can you number crunch this"
50:16;50:17;"Unless Dave do you know off the top"
50:17;50:18;"Of your head"
50:18;50:19;"Average price of a Snickers"
50:19;50:21;"Standalone in 1995"
50:21;50:22;"No I don't know"
50:22;50:23;"Yeah I was gonna say yeah"
50:23;50:24;"$0.79"
50:24;50:26;"That was my thing"
50:26;50:27;"Like in the mid 90's or something"
50:27;50:29;"According to ChatGPT"
50:29;50:32;"75 cents to a dollar range"
50:32;50:33;"Okay"
50:33;50:34;"95"
50:34;50:35;"Okay but think about it"
50:35;50:37;"That was 30 years ago"
50:37;50:38;"Yeah"
50:38;50:40;"29 if you want to be exact"
50:40;50:42;"So the price of a Snickers"
50:42;50:44;"Is only up"
50:44;50:46;"39 cents"
50:46;50:48;"40, 50 cents"
50:48;50:49;"I just think"
50:49;50:50;"Dude it's percentage though"
50:50;50:51;"It's gone from"
50:51;50:53;"It's more than doubled"
50:53;50:54;"It's less than doubled"
50:54;50:56;"Are you factoring in Shrink Flesh"
50:56;50:57;"Though"
50:57;50:59;"Because it's a smaller bar"
50:59;51:00;"Well"
51:00;51:01;"It's probably like what"
51:01;51:02;"A few grams"
51:02;51:04;"Lighter"
51:04;51:05;"Wait what you're saying"
51:05;51:06;"Current day Snickers is lighter"
51:06;51:07;"Smaller"
51:07;51:09;"Than it would have been in 95"
51:09;51:10;"Yeah and for all we know"
51:10;51:11;"The price of peanuts went down"
51:11;51:12;"Shrink Flesh"
51:12;51:13;"The only thing is"
51:13;51:15;"That's less than double"
51:15;51:17;"How much is a dollar worth now"
51:17;51:18;"Versus 1995"
51:18;51:19;"Okay listen"
51:19;51:20;"If the Snickers"
51:20;51:21;"Let's say"
51:21;51:22;"Seinfeld had said around"
51:22;51:23;"75 cents"
51:23;51:25;"75 cents to a dollar"
51:25;51:26;"So let's just call it 85 cents"
51:26;51:27;"Sure"
51:28;51:28;"And double that would be"
51:28;51:30;"A dollar 70"
51:30;51:32;"So basically doubled"
51:32;51:33;"But you just said"
51:33;51:34;"It's a dollar 39 at Target"
51:34;51:35;"Okay"
51:35;51:37;"So it's well under doubled"
51:37;51:38;"And I just want to know"
51:38;51:39;"Yeah"
51:39;51:40;"A dollar in 95"
51:40;51:42;"Is a dollar 71"
51:42;51:43;"In 2022"
51:43;51:45;"Okay"
51:45;51:46;"I didn't have the calculator"
51:46;51:48;"I spaced out for a second"
51:48;51:49;"Yeah yeah"
51:49;51:51;"So the value of a dollar"
51:51;51:52;"In 95"
51:52;51:54;"Is equivalent to a dollar 71"
51:54;51:56;"In 2022"
51:57;51:58;"Which is the latest year"
51:58;51:59;"That data is available"
51:59;52:00;"To chat GPT"
52:00;52:01;"Mmhmm"
52:01;52:02;"So maybe"
52:02;52:03;"The price of the Snickers"
52:03;52:04;"Has risen"
52:04;52:05;"Higher than the"
52:05;52:07;"Relative rate of inflation"
52:07;52:08;"Or lower"
52:08;52:09;"I'm confused"
52:09;52:10;"Whatever"
52:10;52:11;"Who cares"
52:11;52:12;"I think that's a good price"
52:12;52:13;"But"
52:13;52:14;"I think that's a great price"
52:14;52:15;"It's an honest price"
52:15;52:16;"Right so"
52:16;52:17;"$4 for a kind though"
52:17;52:18;"The joke was"
52:18;52:20;"Ezra as Jake"
52:20;52:21;"Saying what $70"
52:21;52:22;"For the Snickers"
52:22;52:23;"That seems like a lot"
52:23;52:24;"Yeah no I was just imagining"
52:24;52:25;"Jake because he never looks"
52:26;52:26;"At the Snickers cost"
52:26;52:27;"And actually a lot of people"
52:27;52:28;"Have to be"
52:28;52:29;"Careful about this"
52:29;52:31;"You don't even think about it"
52:31;52:32;"And you just swipe it"
52:32;52:33;"For all you know"
52:33;52:34;"You gotta go check"
52:34;52:35;"Your CVS receipts"
52:35;52:36;"And stuff"
52:36;52:38;"Because at the end of the month"
52:38;52:39;"Your wife"
52:39;52:40;"Your accountant"
52:40;52:41;"Might say"
52:41;52:42;"You got hosed man"
52:42;52:43;"You paid $70 for a Snicker"
52:43;52:45;"You go into a mom and pop shop"
52:45;52:46;"You don't really think about it"
52:46;52:47;"Yeah"
52:47;52:48;"You always have to look"
52:48;52:50;"Paying with the phone"
52:50;52:51;"For some reason"
52:51;52:52;"Corresponds"
52:52;52:53;"For me"
52:53;52:54;"For just like"
52:55;52:55;"Not thinking about"
52:55;52:57;"What the price"
52:57;52:58;"Or like engaging"
52:58;52:59;"With the fact that"
52:59;53:00;"I'm buying something at all"
53:00;53:01;"Exactly"
53:01;53:02;"I wonder"
53:02;53:04;"You'd probably get called out"
53:04;53:05;"Within like three weeks"
53:05;53:07;"By one of those"
53:07;53:08;"Investigative"
53:08;53:09;"Journalist"
53:09;53:11;"Local news shows"
53:11;53:13;"But imagine you're just like"
53:13;53:14;"A local gas station owner"
53:14;53:15;"And you're just like"
53:15;53:16;"F*** it"
53:16;53:17;"Twizzlers"
53:17;53:18;"$100"
53:18;53:20;"And you're just like"
53:20;53:21;"For every"
53:21;53:22;"For every 10 sales I lose"
53:22;53:24;"I'll get one mark"
53:24;53:26;"Who just pays it"
53:26;53:27;"You know"
53:27;53:28;"Rich person just pays it"
53:28;53:29;"And leaves"
53:29;53:30;"Never thinks about it"
53:30;53:31;"I think that you could maybe"
53:31;53:32;"Get a couple months in"
53:32;53:33;"And you're probably"
53:33;53:34;"Your Twizzler profits"
53:34;53:36;"Are up significantly"
53:36;53:37;"And then one day"
53:37;53:38;"Here comes f***ing"
53:38;53:39;"You know Channel 4"
53:39;53:41;"Can I talk to you sir?"
53:41;53:43;"Oh my god"
53:43;53:44;"Yeah"
53:44;53:45;"America was built"
53:45;53:46;"On $100 Twizzlers"
53:46;53:48;"Ma'am"
53:49;53:50;"Baby"
53:50;53:52;"Don't you want a man like me"
53:52;53:54;"Oh baby, baby"
53:54;53:56;"Just a simple simple woman"
53:56;53:58;"Oh baby, baby"
53:58;54:00;"I wanna look into your eyes and you"
54:00;54:02;"Oh baby, baby"
54:02;54:04;"Smile and your body has to do"
54:04;54:15;"Oh baby, baby"
54:15;54:17;"I wanna see you looking down the street"
54:17;54:19;"Oh baby, baby"
54:19;54:21;"Looking good enough to you"
54:21;54:23;"Oh baby, baby"
54:23;54:25;"I'm a professional disco ball"
54:25;54:27;"Oh baby, baby"
54:27;54:28;"I wanna dance"
54:28;54:30;"And get the ball rollin'"
54:30;54:31;"Yeah"
54:31;54:33;"Talk about yeah"
54:33;54:35;"Yeah"
54:35;54:37;"Talk about yeah"
54:37;54:39;"I wonder if the Twizzler"
54:39;54:40;"You know"
54:40;54:41;"The manufacturer of Twizzler"
54:41;54:43;"Would have anything"
54:43;54:45;"To say about that"
54:45;54:46;"Yeah I guess there are"
54:46;54:47;"All sorts of rules"
54:47;54:48;"I mean like with tickets"
54:48;54:50;"The secondary ticket market"
54:50;54:52;"They try to rein it in"
54:52;54:54;"So you don't get these like scumbags"
54:54;54:56;"Using like sophisticated computer programs"
54:56;54:57;"Buying up all the tickets"
54:57;54:58;"With no intent"
54:58;54:59;"You know and then"
54:59;55:01;"Reselling them for sky's the limit"
55:01;55:02;"But at the same"
55:02;55:03;"By the same token"
55:03;55:04;"Free market"
55:04;55:06;"American capitalism"
55:06;55:08;"Like you gotta let people"
55:08;55:09;"You gotta let people"
55:09;55:11;"Yeah price it where their"
55:11;55:13;"Their local market"
55:13;55:15;"Wants to pay for it"
55:15;55:16;"I know"
55:16;55:17;"It's a hundred dollars"
55:17;55:18;"In where Jake lives"
55:18;55:19;"I don't know"
55:19;55:20;"Yeah like Jake"
55:20;55:21;"How would you feel"
55:21;55:23;"If Gavin Newsom came out"
55:23;55:24;"And said"
55:24;55:25;"The fine art market"
55:25;55:26;"Is out of control"
55:26;55:28;"A big painting can be sold"
55:28;55:30;"For no more than five thousand bucks"
55:30;55:32;"And like a little painting"
55:32;55:33;"Maybe you know"
55:33;55:34;"One thousand five hundred"
55:34;55:35;"We're capping it"
55:35;55:36;"You know you could totally"
55:36;55:37;"See somebody be like"
55:37;55:39;"By selling these works"
55:39;55:41;"Of art for so much"
55:41;55:42;"It allows like the"
55:42;55:44;"The big fish to get even bigger"
55:44;55:45;"It allows"
55:45;55:47;"The you know"
55:47;55:48;"These well known artists"
55:48;55:49;"Like the David Hockneys"
55:49;55:51;"Of the world"
55:51;55:52;"To be selling"
55:52;55:53;"Their art"
55:53;55:54;"For sometimes"
55:54;55:56;"Thousands of times"
55:56;55:58;"What your local coffee shop artist"
55:58;55:59;"Is selling"
55:59;56:00;"Is that fair"
56:00;56:01;"That's not fair"
56:02;56:03;"The state of California"
56:03;56:04;"Has to do something about it"
56:04;56:05;"That's not fair at all"
56:05;56:06;"And that's what I'm"
56:06;56:07;"And that's what I'm campaigning on"
56:07;56:09;"Regulating the art market"
56:09;56:10;"That's your platform"
56:10;56:11;"Yeah"
56:11;56:12;"What about"
56:12;56:13;"What about like music venues"
56:13;56:14;"And tickets"
56:14;56:15;"So what we charge"
56:15;56:16;"Richard Pictures"
56:16;56:17;"Charges"
56:17;56:18;"At the door"
56:18;56:19;"At the Old Town Pub"
56:19;56:20;"That should be"
56:20;56:21;"Ballpark"
56:21;56:22;"What Vampire Weekend's"
56:22;56:23;"Charging at the Hollywood Bowl"
56:23;56:24;"Yes"
56:24;56:25;"And it's also"
56:25;56:27;"What The Weekend"
56:27;56:28;"Should be charging"
56:28;56:29;"At SoFi Stadium"
56:29;56:31;"Everybody comes home"
56:31;56:32;"With three thousand bucks"
56:32;56:33;"This is the Ian McKay"
56:33;56:36;"Five dollars for a show"
56:36;56:37;"This is also"
56:37;56:38;"Everybody comes home"
56:38;56:40;"With three thousand bucks"
56:40;56:41;"So that means"
56:41;56:42;"That a ticket to see"
56:42;56:43;"The Weekend at SoFi"
56:43;56:44;"Costs a nickel"
56:44;56:45;"And you know"
56:45;56:46;"A ticket to see"
56:46;56:47;"Richard Pictures"
56:47;56:49;"At Old Town Pub"
56:49;56:51;"Ends up costing a hundred dollars"
56:51;56:52;"That's like the inverse"
56:52;56:53;"Now I'm confused"
56:53;56:54;"Dave"
56:54;56:55;"What are ticket prices"
56:55;56:56;"At Disney Hall"
56:56;56:57;"For your March 2nd show"
56:57;56:58;"I don't know"
56:58;56:59;"That's the"
56:59;57:00;"That's probably the one question"
57:00;57:01;"That you could ask me"
57:01;57:02;"That I don't"
57:02;57:03;"That I don't know"
57:03;57:04;"Well I'm sure it depends"
57:04;57:05;"Well first of all"
57:05;57:06;"Dave is playing"
57:06;57:07;"Disney Hall"
57:07;57:08;"Designed by Frank Gehry"
57:08;57:09;"Downtown Los Angeles"
57:09;57:11;"And I imagine"
57:11;57:12;"The tickets vary widely"
57:12;57:13;"Because"
57:13;57:15;"You can be like front row"
57:15;57:16;"There's different balconies"
57:16;57:18;"You can sit behind the orchestra"
57:18;57:19;"Too right"
57:19;57:20;"Yes"
57:20;57:21;"That's pretty cool"
57:21;57:22;"A couple years ago"
57:22;57:23;"I saw this Messian piece"
57:23;57:24;"Called From the Canyons"
57:24;57:25;"To the Stars"
57:25;57:27;"Which I mention"
57:27;57:28;"Only because"
57:28;57:29;"It's like"
57:29;57:31;"There's a really big"
57:31;57:32;"Percussion section"
57:32;57:33;"There's like seven percussionists"
57:33;57:34;"In this piece"
57:34;57:35;"Or something like that"
57:35;57:36;"And anyway"
57:36;57:37;"It was like almost sold out"
57:37;57:38;"The show"
57:38;57:39;"And I was like oh my god"
57:39;57:40;"From the canyons"
57:40;57:41;"To the stars is happening"
57:41;57:42;"I need to go"
57:42;57:43;"And the only tickets"
57:43;57:44;"That were still available"
57:44;57:45;"Were those directly"
57:45;57:46;"Behind the orchestra"
57:46;57:48;"And it was seriously"
57:48;57:50;"Like a ten dollar ticket"
57:50;57:51;"Or something like that"
57:51;57:52;"Whoa"
57:52;57:53;"And it was the best seat"
57:53;57:54;"In the house"
57:54;57:55;"It was amazing"
57:55;57:56;"Could you hear the piccolos"
57:56;57:57;"I could hear the piccolo"
57:57;57:58;"Yeah"
57:58;57:59;"Okay"
57:59;58:00;"So it's not like you were"
58:00;58:01;"Just hearing bom bom bom"
58:01;58:02;"Oh not at all"
58:02;58:03;"Yeah no"
58:03;58:04;"Yeah I mean I guess"
58:04;58:05;"I don't know"
58:05;58:06;"I think the acoustics"
58:06;58:07;"Of the space"
58:07;58:08;"Are such that"
58:08;58:09;"I don't know"
58:09;58:10;"It was like a pretty balanced"
58:10;58:11;"And there's probably speakers"
58:11;58:12;"In there"
58:12;58:12;"So it's like a mixed"
58:12;58:13;"Performance"
58:13;58:14;"Very lightly amplified"
58:14;58:15;"I think"
58:15;58:16;"Oh that's cool"
58:16;58:17;"But yeah"
58:17;58:18;"No so that's like"
58:18;58:19;"I don't know if"
58:19;58:20;"Behind the stage"
58:20;58:21;"Is open for"
58:21;58:22;"For this show"
58:22;58:23;"But"
58:23;58:24;"I feel like it usually is"
58:24;58:25;"But alright"
58:25;58:26;"That's good"
58:26;58:27;"For the listeners to know"
58:27;58:28;"And what"
58:28;58:29;"This is not just"
58:29;58:30;"A typical Dirty Projectors"
58:30;58:32;"Concert"
58:32;58:33;"You want to explain"
58:33;58:34;"Why this show is happening"
58:34;58:35;"At the iconic Disney hall"
58:35;58:37;"And what it's all about"
58:37;58:38;"Oh right"
58:38;58:39;"It's basically like an album"
58:39;58:40;"That I've been working on"
58:41;58:42;"For three-ish years"
58:42;58:44;"Now"
58:44;58:45;"That started"
58:45;58:47;"As a piece of chamber music"
58:47;58:49;"And has sort of"
58:49;58:50;"Gone through a whole bunch"
58:50;58:51;"Of different iterations"
58:51;58:53;"And is now just like"
58:53;58:55;"The album"
58:55;58:56;"You know"
58:56;58:58;"It's called Song of the Earth"
58:58;58:59;"And"
58:59;59:00;"We're kind of like"
59:00;59:01;"Premiering it"
59:01;59:03;"With the literal LA Phil"
59:03;59:05;"So that's why it's"
59:05;59:06;"That's why it's at"
59:06;59:07;"Disney"
59:07;59:08;"Disney Concert"
59:08;59:09;"Yeah"
59:09;59:10;"Just to be clear"
59:10;59:11;"The three harmonic"
59:11;59:13;"Musicians will be playing"
59:13;59:14;"Off of like sheet music"
59:14;59:15;"That you've written"
59:15;59:16;"Yeah"
59:16;59:17;"Yeah yeah"
59:17;59:18;"Who's conducting"
59:18;59:19;"Gustavo"
59:19;59:20;"No not Gustavo"
59:20;59:21;"Not Dudamel"
59:21;59:22;"Not the dude"
59:22;59:23;"I don't know if people"
59:23;59:24;"Call him that"
59:24;59:25;"But if"
59:25;59:26;"Bradley Cooper"
59:26;59:27;"Oh Bradley Cooper could"
59:27;59:28;"Bradley Cooper could"
59:28;59:29;"It's Lydia Tarr"
59:29;59:30;"Actually"
59:30;59:31;"Lydia Tarr"
59:31;59:32;"Bradley Cooper"
59:32;59:33;"Dudamel"
59:33;59:34;"Those are the three most"
59:34;59:35;"Famous conductors"
59:35;59:36;"Living"
59:36;59:37;"It's a"
59:37;59:38;"It's a woman named"
59:38;59:39;"Sarah Hicks"
59:39;59:40;"Is conducting"
59:40;59:41;"And"
59:41;59:43;"Yeah she"
59:43;59:44;"I've never"
59:44;59:45;"I haven't met her yet"
59:45;59:46;"But"
59:46;59:47;"She's worked with a lot of friends"
59:47;59:48;"And she's apparently"
59:48;59:49;"Really awesome"
59:49;59:50;"And then"
59:50;59:51;"You'll be singing"
59:51;59:52;"Yeah"
59:52;59:53;"Yeah yeah"
59:53;59:54;"I'll be singing"
59:54;59:55;"And playing"
59:55;59:57;"The nylon string guitar"
59:57;59:58;"That's tight"
59:58;59:59;"And yeah"
59:59;01:00:00;"The"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"The band"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Is in the mix as well"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Mike's playing the drums"
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Maya"
01:00:05;01:00:06;"And Felicia"
01:00:06;01:00:07;"And Olga"
01:00:07;01:00:08;"Are"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Are singing"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Olga's like playing"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Harpsichord"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"And Farfisa"
01:00:12;01:00:13;"And then"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"We've got a couple"
01:00:14;01:00:15;"Percussionists"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"As well on the band side"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"So is it"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Songs"
01:00:18;01:00:19;"That roughly"
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Fall in like"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"What we expect from like a"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"A rock pop"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"Album"
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Like"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Three to five minutes"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"It's like"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"Man"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"So this is the first time"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"I'm being asked any questions"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"About"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"This music"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"This is a great opportunity"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"To get your talking points"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"In order"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"I know"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"I'm not 100% straight yet"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"But like my first"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"My first reaction"
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Is really like"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"I don't know"
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Not good enough"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"I heard some of the music"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"A while ago"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"And I was like"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"This reminds me of"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"The Getty Address"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"This is like an updated"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"Version of that"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"In a way"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"It's a similar palette"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Of like working with"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Orchestral elements"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"In song form"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"And instead of"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"The album being about"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Don Henley"
01:01:01;01:01:02;"It's about"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Glenn Frey"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Rest in peace"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"It's about Glenn"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"This time"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"In the end"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"I will"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Yeah there's going to be"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Several"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"You know"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"Sort of iterations"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"Of Song of the Earth"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"One about each member"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"Of"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"The Eagle"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Timothy B. Schmitt"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Version"
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Right"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Looking forward to that"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Yeah that's Song of the Earth"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Four probably"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"City girls"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"Just seem"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"To find out early"
01:01:28;01:01:33;"How to open doors"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"With just a smile"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"A rich old man"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"She won't have to worry"
01:01:42;01:01:47;"She'll dress up all in lace"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"And go in style"
01:01:49;01:01:53;"Late at night"
01:01:53;01:01:57;"Her big old house gets lonely"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"I guess every form"
01:02:01;01:02:04;"Of refuge has its price"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"And it breaks her heart"
01:02:08;01:02:11;"To think her love is only"
01:02:11;01:02:15;"Given to a man"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"With hands as cold as ice"
01:02:18;01:02:22;"So she tells him"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"She must go out for the evening"
01:02:26;01:02:31;"To comfort an old friend"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Who's feeling down"
01:02:35;01:02:38;"But he knows where she's going"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"As she's leaving"
01:02:40;01:02:44;"She is headed for"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"The cheating side of town"
01:02:47;01:02:52;"You can't hide"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"Your lying eyes"
01:02:55;01:02:59;"And your smile"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"Is a thin disguise"
01:03:03;01:03:07;"I thought by now"
01:03:07;01:03:11;"You'd realize"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"There ain't no way"
01:03:13;01:03:17;"To hide your lying eyes"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"So it's sort of like, I don't know, it flows."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"As a piece of music, it's continuous."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"There are sort of like melodies"
01:03:25;01:03:29;"and like aspects of the lyrics"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"that recur throughout,"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"throughout the thing, front to back."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"There are like musical elements"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"that sort of like weave through,"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"you know, across the thing."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"But then it also manages"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"to break down into these"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"three minute, four minute chunks as well."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Sick."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Yeah, it's kind of like a killer's album."
01:03:50;01:03:54;"Or it's like S&M, Symphony and Metallica."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Do you remember that live album?"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"I think I missed that one."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"It was cool."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"It was basically Metallica played"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"their greatest hits with a symphony."
01:04:02;01:04:06;"Cello's going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"Wait, actually, maybe we got to throw this on."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Wait, first of all, there's 0% chance"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"this has anything to do with what Dave does."
01:04:13;01:04:17;"But just in the spirit of TC,"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"we got to throw it on."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"I don't remember, I remember at the time"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"thinking it was kind of cool."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"I can see that, you know,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"I guess because I really have been"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"into like way more,"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"I don't know, scored music,"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"like old music."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"My recommendations, my algorithm"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"is getting more classical leaning."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"If you have Apple Music,"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"there's a whole classical app"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"you can download."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"It's just called Classical."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"I heard that."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"It's cool."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"I'm intrigued by that."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Yeah, you should check it out."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Where I'm going with this, though,"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"is that, so the other day I was listening"
01:04:52;01:04:56;"to this like specific,"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"what's it called?"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Play, update, like a constantly updated playlist."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"What is that called?"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Whatever, it's just like the new,"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Playlist, playlist."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"The new classical releases."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"And like number three that week"
01:05:11;01:05:15;"was some like beautiful"
01:05:15;01:05:18;"choral acapella arrangement"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"of some Metallica song."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Okay, Metallica, well, Metallica"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"has not never been a,"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"there's always been a connection"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"between metal and classical, right?"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"For sure."
01:05:28;01:05:30;"The first metal artist was Antonio Vivaldi,"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"roughly speaking."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Right."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"Just shredding arpeggios."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"Anybody who's listened to Four Seasons"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"knows that it's got everything"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"that a metalhead would want."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"It goes hard."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"And, you know, among a million other"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"classical Baroque composers."
01:05:47;01:05:50;"And, you know, and Metallica famously"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"loved Ennio Morricone,"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"the film composer, who, of course,"
01:05:54;01:05:58;"is very conversant in classical arrangement."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"This is what Enter Sandman"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"sounds like on that album."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"This is live with the"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"San Francisco Symphony Orchestra."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Wow, busy."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"Getting kind of spy movie."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Yeah."
01:06:27;01:06:30;"And this is before every movie trailer"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"had like a symphonic version of a pop song."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Right."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"This is some like Live or Let Die type vibe."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Yeah, right."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Yeah, Metallica writing a Bond song"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"would be amazing."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"I feel like the perfect moment"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"for that was 2000."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"But whatever, I still support it."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Let loose, man."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"I mean, I'll say that I think,"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I don't know if he writes the lyrics by himself,"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"but I think James Hetfield has such"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"like a magnificent way with words."
01:07:14;01:07:17;"So many just like legendary"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Metallica song titles."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Yeah."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"On this album, there's a song called"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"The God That Failed,"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"which is taken from a book about"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Soviet communism."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Oh, wow."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"I just love the idea of like Hetfield"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"just being in a bookstore"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"and just being like the God that failed."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"It's like that's going on the Black album."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"I'm going to jot that down."
01:07:49;01:07:50;"That is epic."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"What year is it?"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"This is,"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"this was recorded in 1999."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"The conductor is Michael Kamen."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"Wow."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"So what we're playing at Disney Hall,"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"I don't think it's going to sound"
01:08:04;01:08:05;"that much like that."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Okay, whatever you're playing,"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"how about a,"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"I would have just an encore event"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"or something and ready to go."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Just in case."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"That's probably a good idea."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"People are going to be f***ing hype."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"You're going to be like,"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"all right, guys,"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"that's the end of the piece."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"They're going to be like,"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"one more song."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"I guess that's one thing about,"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"you've spent years composing this."
01:08:24;01:08:25;"You don't want to be caught"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"with your parents down"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"when you got the crowd chanting"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"one more song"
01:08:28;01:08:29;"and be like, guys,"
01:08:29;01:08:32;"there's 50 people on stage"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"with painstaking orchestral arrangements."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"We can't just bust out,"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"you know, Love Light,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Louie Louie."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"So just have something ready."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"That's a good call."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"Wait, I'm still thinking about"
01:08:44;01:08:45;"this Metallica and classical thing."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"Jay, wait,"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"that movie,"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"Your Friends and Neighbors,"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"do you guys remember that movie?"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"Yeah, the Neil LaBute movie."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"The whole soundtrack is like"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"cello quartet versions"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"of Metallica songs."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Oh, really?"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"I don't remember that."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Metallica rules."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"Great band."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"There's one other thing"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"that I want to say about Metallica."
01:09:04;01:09:07;"I was listening to One"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"the other day."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"Incredible song."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Yeah."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"What's insane is how out of tune"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"the guitar solo is in the first minute."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"But actually,"
01:09:15;01:09:16;"that's not what I was going to say."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"What I was going to say is"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"imagine whatever,"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"they're like writing the song together."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"They're in the rehearsal."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"I don't know how"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"they wrote songs or whatever,"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"but just thinking about the moment"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"that that rhythm arrived."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"With the..."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Yeah."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"Can you imagine how psyched"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"you would be?"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"Yeah."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Just playing that"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"for the first time."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Oh, is this a thing?"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Or sorry, I'm sorry."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"Is this a thing that we can do?"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"Can we do this in this song?"
01:09:47;01:09:48;"And also just thinking about"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"like that rhythm."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"[imitates rhythm]"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Those like whatever those"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"like triplet 16th"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"or whatever they are."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"Where does that like that rhythm..."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"Where does that come from?"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"I mean,"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"is it a little bit like some"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"some Spanish like Berlioz type thing?"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"What's like the famous Spanish"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"[imitates rhythm]"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"Like the..."
01:10:07;01:10:10;"[imitates rhythm]"
01:10:10;01:10:13;"I guess there's like the La Boheme."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Yeah."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Even that you could probably say"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"traces roots to classical."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"But yeah, it's so hard."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Well, let's see what it sounded like"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"at this concert."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"When does..."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"That happens like pretty deep"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"in the song, right?"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Yeah, maybe like five minutes in."
01:10:25;01:10:46;"♪"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Do you guys think you can do that"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"on a double kick drum pedal?"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"No way."
01:10:51;01:11:02;"♪"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Oh my God."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"♪"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Oh, this is very James Bond."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"My friend just posted a"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"a clip from them playing"
01:11:12;01:11:13;"the..."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"some Mahler symphony"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"like last week"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"and it sounded really, really sick,"
01:11:17;01:11:21;"which I say in advance of saying"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"that these arrangements"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"that they're playing here are..."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"I kind of agree with Jake."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"It's like the songs are enough."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Like I can't believe..."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"It's a hat on a hat, man."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah, it's a hat on a hat."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"I can't believe the arrangement"
01:11:32;01:11:36;"was like, oh, let's add more parts."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Let's not like adapt the..."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"Well, here's a counterpoint."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"Even if this needed some finessing,"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"this is only two nights they did"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"at the Berkeley Community Theater."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"I think the reason that you hear"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"SFSO just demolishing"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"a Mahler symphony in 2024"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"is because the seed was planted 25 years ago."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"That maybe of all the symphony orchestras"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"in America,"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"they could kick a little more ass."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"They could come a little bit more correct."
01:12:07;01:12:09;"You know, like it's not..."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"It's not New York."
01:12:11;01:12:12;"It's not LA."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"It's a smaller city."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"What does San Francisco have to be proud of?"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"The bass band in America came from there."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"And I think the reason that you..."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"The two biggest bands."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Who's the other one?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Grateful Dead."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"And Grateful Dead."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"So I think the reason that even in 2024"
01:12:27;01:12:29;"they're coming correct on Mahler"
01:12:29;01:12:30;"is because..."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"They warmed up."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"A seed was planted in 1999"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"by James Hetfield,"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Lars Ulrich,"
01:12:38;01:12:39;"Jason Newsted."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"This was the end of his tenure."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"And Kirk Hammett."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"That's all I'm saying."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"I like that."
01:12:45;01:12:46;"And maybe that's the same thing"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"that's going to happen with LA Phil."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"Probably. Probably."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Also just to be completely clear about this."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Now obviously,"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"you've always had a foot in both worlds."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"Like,"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"you know,"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"I still remember the first time"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"I ever heard your music."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"I was a college student."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"And I was like,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"""Damn, this guy's on some different sh*t."""
01:13:03;01:13:05;"And it's because you know how to compose"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"for chamber music or orchestra."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"But you're also very much a rocker"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"bringing these things together."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"You've done work that's kind of like standalone."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"You've obviously released many"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"classic, beloved, traditional albums."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"But you've also done standalone work."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"So this one,"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"this is the world premiere,"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"meaning there's no recordings"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"of this floating around."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"You're launching this music"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"with this performance."
01:13:31;01:13:36;"Like in a true classical world kind of way."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Yeah, that's true."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"Okay, right."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"That's exciting."
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Yeah, that's awesome."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"It has to do also with the sort of"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"the specifics of the way"
01:13:44;01:13:45;"this music came together,"
01:13:45;01:13:46;"which is like,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Jake, you mentioned The Getty Address,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"which is like a Journey Projectors album"
01:13:50;01:13:53;"from a really long time ago."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"2005."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"19 years ago."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"So 20 years ago, right now,"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"I was probably in the same"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"boat that I'm in right now,"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"which is like 11th hour"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"trying to finish the record."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Trying to finish the record."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"But yeah, I mean, I always like,"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"I have this"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"an equal sort of attraction"
01:14:17;01:14:20;"and maybe revulsion"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"might be too strong of a word"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"to kind of like that world."
01:14:25;01:14:28;"Like when I was in college,"
01:14:28;01:14:31;"they had a program"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"where you could apply for grant money"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"for independent projects,"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"but you had to set up"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"like a different tax ID"
01:14:38;01:14:39;"for the entity"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"that would receive the grant money."
01:14:41;01:14:46;"And I named my entity,"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"I named it Orchestral Society"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"for the Preservation of the Orchestra."
01:14:50;01:14:51;"I remember that."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"That's sick."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"And yeah, I mean, I think I was just,"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"I sort of had a chip on my shoulder"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"that it was this, you know,"
01:14:58;01:15:02;"demonstrably like dead art form."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"All that classical s*** sucks,"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"heavy metal rules."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Exactly."
01:15:07;01:15:10;"Classical drools, metal rules."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"Wow."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"That felt like it could be"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"like in the holdovers, Jake."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"Totally."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Obviously, from a young age,"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"you've had a talent"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"arranging for orchestral instruments."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"And obviously you've taken inspiration"
01:15:24;01:15:28;"from the history of classical music, right?"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Yeah. And so the way this piece,"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"the Song of the Earth started life"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"is a friend of mine"
01:15:36;01:15:38;"who is the conductor"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"of a chamber group in Europe,"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"this group called Stargaze,"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"had been trying to get me"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"to write a piece for them"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"for like years."
01:15:47;01:15:51;"And then at some point in the pandemic,"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"we were just like,"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"""All right, it's on."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"This is going to be"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"this pandemic era thing."""
01:15:57;01:16:01;"And the premiere for that work"
01:16:01;01:16:06;"was set for like when Alma,"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"my daughter, was going to be like"
01:16:08;01:16:08;"six months old or something."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"And so, of course,"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"the time around the third trimester"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"and like having a newborn"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"is so crazy."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"And I completely procrastinated"
01:16:19;01:16:22;"writing this piece for them."
01:16:22;01:16:26;"And when it finally became inescapable"
01:16:26;01:16:27;"that I would have to write"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"this 40-minute piece or whatever"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"for my friend's chamber group,"
01:16:31;01:16:34;"it was like a kind of like,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"just like a deep like for rewrite."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"I didn't have the luxury"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"of being able to second guess"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"or create some sort of"
01:16:43;01:16:46;"intellectual framework"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"around the music."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"I literally just needed to be like"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"putting music on the page"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"or whatever."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"And so in doing that,"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"I ended up making something"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"that was like just really different"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"than the last couple like"
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Dirty Projectors records."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"So different that I was just sort of like,"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"""Oh yeah, this is this is"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"Orchestral Society for the Preservation"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"of the Orchestra."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"Like this is, I don't know what this is."""
01:17:14;01:17:16;"And it took me actually the premiere"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"of that version of the piece"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"to be like, ""Whoa, actually,"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"this is like my favorite thing ever."""
01:17:23;01:17:25;"And so I've been sort of"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"making it into something"
01:17:27;01:17:29;"coherent since then."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"And that's what Song of the Earth is."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"That's what Song of the Earth is."
01:17:32;01:17:32;"So it was an orch... yeah,"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"a chamber piece that has evolved over time."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"I also, I got to say, I love,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"I love the hero's journey"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"of young holdovers kind of Dave"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"creating a new tax ID."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Creating a new tax ID"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"at an esteemed university in Connecticut."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"That does seem like a real plot point"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"in an Alexander Payne movie."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"Like sweating the tax ID."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"You got to create a new tax ID, son!"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"An EIN?"
01:17:58;01:18:01;"What is an Employee Identification Number?"
01:18:01;01:18:03;"But I love the idea too that"
01:18:03;01:18:07;"kind of young, young punk rock dude"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"and you come up with a name."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"It's not like you called this your,"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"whatever this, what is it?"
01:18:12;01:18:13;"An EILC?"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"Whatever, whatever entity you create,"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"it's not like you called it overtly."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"You were just a little bit snarky."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"You didn't call it like,"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"like, ""orchestral music sucks."""
01:18:21;01:18:25;"You, whatever, you called this kind of..."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"Cheeky."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Cheeky thing."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"And then all these years later,"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"decades later..."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Here I am."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Here you are."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"And maybe you actually realized like,"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"you know what?"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"It's cool that the orchestra is preserved."
01:18:37;01:18:40;"Like as much as"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"there's been so many times in history"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"where kind of like things that people think are fuddy-duddy,"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"like, you know, a hall that puts on orchestral work,"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"you know, like,"
01:18:48;01:18:49;"because also it's tough out there"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"for like a French horn player."
01:18:51;01:18:52;"You know?"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"Well, you know, it's funny you should,"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"you should talk about the French horn"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"because I feel like we're sort of burying,"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"at least since I've been on the call,"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"we're sort of burying the lead here,"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"which is like,"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"happy album announce day,"
01:19:34;01:19:35;"Nazareth."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"I noticed in some of the,"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"like the visual,"
01:19:40;01:19:41;"the visuals this morning,"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"like kind of an emphasis on"
01:19:45;01:19:49;"or a little bit of like storytelling about,"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"there was like a French horn in there."
01:19:51;01:19:52;"There was like a conductor."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"That's probably why French horn has been on my mind"
01:19:54;01:19:57;"because some of the album we recorded"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"at East West Studio"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"where we did a big old orchestra day."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Yeah."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"I actually should have invited you."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"I didn't realize,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Ariel has a bit more experience"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"because he's scored a bunch of films"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"and TV shows that,"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"you know, I invited like my family."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"It's kind of like, you know,"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"sweet to have Rashid and our son there"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"checking everything out."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"But Ariel,"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"and it's actually really fun."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Ariel made it like,"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"a little bit like a party."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"So like in the control room,"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"I get there and Ariel's like,"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"his like cousin,"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"who's like a professor."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"He's like,"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"I'm just in LA for a couple of days."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Was there and I was like,"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"Oh, what's up, man?"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"And then like,"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"you know,"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"random people like the old other musicians"
01:20:35;01:20:37;"stopping by just to check it out."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"A guy we both take tennis lessons with sometimes."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Shout out to Simon."
01:20:40;01:20:42;"That was awesome that he was there."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"You know,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"so there's just like a lot of people coming through"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"and that made it more of a special occasion."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"And there's a,"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"there's one song and there's a,"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"which is one of my favorite songs on the album,"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"which has a,"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"some French horn harmonies."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"And it really is just such a beautiful instrument."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"It's insane."
01:20:59;01:21:02;"That's a top three orchestral instrument, right?"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"Orchestral instruments ranked."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"I don't know."
01:21:06;01:21:07;"Yeah, I mean,"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"you've got to be right."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"It's just like such a cool one."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"It doesn't get the glory of,"
01:21:12;01:21:13;"you know,"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"trumpet, of course,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"exists in so many genres that,"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"you know, whatever."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"But the French horn,"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"it's like,"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"it's such an orchestral instrument and just so like sweet and warm."
01:21:21;01:21:25;"It bridges the winds and the brassier brass."
01:21:25;01:21:28;"I was at a scoring session for the,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"the new Avatar movies a couple months ago."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"And like,"
01:21:32;01:21:36;"because the budget is like unlimited for that movie,"
01:21:36;01:21:40;"there were like eight French horn players,"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"just like blasting,"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"like the eight French horn players in Los Angeles."
01:21:46;01:21:48;"Ripping these parts."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"It was,"
01:21:49;01:21:50;"I had never heard anything like it before."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"It was amazing."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"I love that."
01:21:52;01:21:56;"Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Yeah."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Is a legitimate cause now."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"We're back."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"We love this stuff."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"We got to,"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"it is important that we got to be like,"
01:22:03;01:22:08;"taking children to go see classical music's greatest hits."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"You know,"
01:22:09;01:22:13;"you got to be like a kid and go see like Beethoven's fifth or whatever."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Right."
01:22:14;01:22:20;"Well, I think I had this sort of like narrative when I was like in school,"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"where I was just,"
01:22:22;01:22:23;"you know,"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"I was imposing some sort of like cultural narrative that,"
01:22:27;01:22:31;"that assumed that music's obsolescence."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"But lately I've been feeling like,"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"what if it's not obsolete?"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"What if it's,"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"what if it just is ageless in this,"
01:22:38;01:22:43;"in this way and it ebbs and flows and like some of the most futuristic,"
01:22:43;01:22:48;"music that will be made in the next whatever,"
01:22:48;01:22:52;"10 years will be made for French horns."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"I think that's totally possible."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"Yeah."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"This is maybe a random reverence."
01:22:57;01:22:58;"You know,"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"there's like that famous quote,"
01:22:59;01:23:03;"I do not know which weapons World War III will be fought with."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"However,"
01:23:04;01:23:08;"World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"That,"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"that means something totally there."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I do not know."
01:23:13;01:23:16;"What futuristic sounds the next year will hold,"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"but I know after that,"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"the futuristic sounds will be cellos and French horns."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Um,"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"also,"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"you know,"
01:23:25;01:23:26;"I've had a little bit,"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"not,"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"not like you,"
01:23:28;01:23:31;"I've never composed anything like this and it's not my,"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"my aptitude,"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"but that's something I have aptitude for."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"But you know,"
01:23:35;01:23:39;"whenever that was about a couple of years ago when we were living in Japan for a"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"while,"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"I mean,"
01:23:41;01:23:45;"everybody's heard of the famous Japanese vinyl bars and like jazz cafes."
01:23:45;01:23:49;"It's like often an older person who plays their jazz records and have a coffee."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"But there's one,"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"a friend put me on to,"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"which is the classical version."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"And this place has existed for almost a hundred years."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Wow."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"It's in Shibuya."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"It's called Lion."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"And it's,"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"you step in,"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"it's got a little bit of a clockwork orange vibe,"
01:24:02;01:24:06;"but like busts of Beethoven and you're sitting forward facing like a church."
01:24:06;01:24:10;"And these big old wooden speakers look like they're from another planet."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"And then they play a mixture of classical music."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"I'd go,"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"oh,"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"there's some weeks I walked there every day."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"That became my ritual."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"Like just for in lunch,"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"if I didn't have anything to do and you know,"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"a kid was in school and Rashida was working,"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"I'd take a long walk and go post up,"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"have a coffee,"
01:24:26;01:24:27;"read and listen to the music."
01:24:27;01:24:30;"And one piece that they played at some point where I was like,"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"I was like,"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"I got a painfully trying to find out what it was."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"Cause like,"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"you know,"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"the dude put on the vinyl and I couldn't quite see the cover."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"But anyway,"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"it was,"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"it was who you brought up before mess."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"Messianne."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"Is that how you say it?"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"The famous French composer."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"You could like be French in the accent or not."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Messianne."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"That's how I say it."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"Olivier Messianne."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"And the one thing I loved about this piece so much,"
01:24:53;01:24:54;"cause I was like,"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"what is this?"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"What piece was it?"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"It was a opera."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"He wrote in the eighties about the life of St."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Francis of Assisi."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Oh,"
01:25:02;01:25:03;"I love that one."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"And I was like,"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"this is so out there,"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"but it's using traditional orchestral instruments,"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"but it's so modernist."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"And I didn't know that much about him."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"I'm sure you probably know a lot more."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"I was like,"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"this dude was in a sense,"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"so traditional,"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"a very devout Catholic."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Yeah."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"So when it came time for him to,"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"you know,"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"even though he was a modernist and when it came time for him to,"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"you know,"
01:25:23;01:25:24;"write an opera in the eighties,"
01:25:24;01:25:29;"he didn't pick a kind of like postmodern playful thing."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Like,"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"like I'm going to write this about the first,"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"the development of plastic containers,"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"you know,"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"or whatever."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"I mean,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"there's something about hearing that music."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"I was like,"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"what,"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"you know,"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"the crazy marimba's going wild."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"And then just being like,"
01:25:45;01:25:48;"this is a deeply religious man who is moved by the story of St."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Francis of Assisi."
01:25:49;01:25:53;"And something about that combo in the traditionalism of the,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"the venues in which it was played."
01:25:55;01:25:59;"And even me hearing it back to back with like Tchaikovsky or whatever."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"And this,"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"it really made me think about like,"
01:26:01;01:26:05;"this is as trad as it gets and as futuristic as it gets."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"And I love that."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"It made a big impression on me."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Wow."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"That sounds like,"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"yeah."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"Yeah."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"I love that."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"I love,"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"I'm forgetting the name of that opera right now,"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"but I love that one."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"And Messiaen is just like such a singular figure."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"I,"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"last time I was in Paris,"
01:26:20;01:26:28;"we met the dude who worked on Messiaen's Ondes Martinaus."
01:26:28;01:26:32;"Which is like a theremin type electronic instrument."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"Yeah."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"And he was,"
01:26:34;01:26:43;"he was like rewiring a speaker that had a sort of like old sort of yellowed label"
01:26:43;01:26:47;"just affixed to the bottom of it."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"It turned out to be Messiaen's,"
01:26:50;01:26:54;"the address of like where Messiaen had lived in Paris."
01:26:54;01:26:55;"Whoa."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"So it was like some old like,"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"yeah,"
01:26:58;01:26:59;"it was really,"
01:26:59;01:27:00;"it was very cool."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"It was very cool."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"But yeah,"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"about the lion,"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"the classical listening,"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"listening bar,"
01:27:06;01:27:10;"that place is so weird because it's like,"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"yeah,"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"it's like all wood paneled."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"Right."
01:27:13;01:27:16;"But then it's like really harsh fluorescent lights."
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Right."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"When I would go there during the day,"
01:27:20;01:27:22;"it was very low lighting."
01:27:22;01:27:24;"I could maybe at certain times of day,"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"they switch it on and it gets a little,"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"it was,"
01:27:26;01:27:27;"it was moody,"
01:27:27;01:27:28;"but I could,"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"that would make,"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"I could totally see that."
01:27:30;01:27:33;"It kind of reminded me of Tough Gong."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"Weirdly."
01:27:35;01:27:36;"In Kingston?"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"Yeah,"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"because of the wood,"
01:27:38;01:27:41;"the wooden speakers and the lion,"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"there's like a prominent sculpture of a lion."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Right."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Yeah."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"Well,"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"outside there's some sort of like stone,"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"faux Gothic thing."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"And yeah,"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"actually,"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"I think,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"I think somebody told me that like maybe that was maybe going to close or"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"whatever support."
01:27:54;01:27:55;"If you,"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"any,"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"anybody,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"if you ever happen to be traveling in Japan or obviously if you live in Japan,"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"support lion."
01:28:00;01:28:01;"It's such a,"
01:28:01;01:28:04;"an important kind of institution because"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"a classical vinyl bar is a great way to take in that kind of music."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"If you're not hooked into like a,"
01:28:09;01:28:12;"an orchestral situation."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Well,"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Dave,"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"is there any,"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"like,"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"is there a Dirty Projectors song that"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"we could go into?"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"That maybe like something,"
01:28:20;01:28:23;"what's the Dirty Projectors song you think has the most like orchestral flavor?"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"I don't know."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"I don't know."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"I mean,"
01:28:27;01:28:31;"it would make a certain amount of sense."
01:28:31;01:28:32;"For you,"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"for to,"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"you know,"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"to do that."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"But I'm in this zone."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Finishing the song of the earth album right now,"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"where I'm like,"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Oh,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"you can't set the stage for the future with some,"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"some music from the past."
01:28:47;01:28:48;"You could do."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Yeah,"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"you could do."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"I will try."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"I like Jake's idea."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"I will truck from the Getty address,"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"which will be celebrating its 20th anniversary next year."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"This is also fun because,"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"you know,"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"I toured with you a little bit when you're touring this album."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"That's right."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"That's what brought the three of us together."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"That's totally true."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"And you know what?"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Getty address tour."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"I remember staying at the Department of Safety,"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"which is."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"Uh huh."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"And in Cortis, Washington."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"Yeah."
01:29:14;01:29:18;"In Phil Elbrum's hometown and playing what?"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Some game and being like,"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Oh man,"
01:29:21;01:29:24;"like Jake and Ezra are really like getting to know each other."
01:29:24;01:29:25;"This is cool."
01:29:25;01:29:28;"Some like card game or something."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"But wait,"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"there's a chance for me to say also,"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Phil,"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Phil Elbrum,"
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Mount Erie,"
01:29:34;01:29:38;"the microphones is opening the Disney Hall show as well."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Amazing."
01:29:39;01:29:44;"Which I'm just so excited about because he is just like,"
01:29:44;01:29:47;"I just I love his music so much."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"He like continues to."
01:29:49;01:29:52;"To just blow minds with everything he's doing,"
01:29:52;01:29:53;"he's evolving."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"He has a feature on Song of the Earth as well."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"So."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Oh,"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"great."

01:49:42;01:49:44;"I don't know if I-- I don't know it by the title."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"Let's see if I recognize it."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Is this going to be a ballad?"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"OK, this is slick '80s music."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"That's a rough bass tone."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Not feeling it?"
01:50:19;01:50:20;"Mm-mm."
01:50:23;01:50:28;"Kind of makes me think of that MGMT song from a few years ago."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"I don't know if I know the one you're talking about."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Oh, it's big."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"It was a big MGMT song."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"Little Dark Age."
01:50:34;01:50:36;"On the record from a couple years ago?"
01:50:36;01:50:37;"Yeah, you're going to like it."
01:50:37;01:50:40;"But it has just like a very '80s bass line."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"It's like-- obviously you'll find this a bit cooler."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"Yeah, I mean, this is sick."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"But wait for the bass synth."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Yeah."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"In many ways, totally different songs."
01:51:12;01:51:15;"But they share a slightly haunted 1988 quality."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"Minimalist."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"Yeah."
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Spooky energy."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"I got to check this record out."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"There's a lot of good songs on it."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"I bet."
01:51:27;01:51:28;"Great band."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"Connecticut band."
01:51:29;01:51:30;"Yes."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"Starting Connecticut."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"Yes."
01:51:32;01:51:35;"I don't think they are currently a Connecticut band."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Oh, sure."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Yeah."
01:51:37;01:51:42;"I mean, Connecticut, in terms of like kind of aughts indie rock,"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"I mean, Dirty Projector is an MGMT."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Yeah."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Although--"
01:51:46;01:51:47;"Much above its weight."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"John Mayer, the extended indie universe."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"Yep."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"I mean, Michael Bolton."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"Yep."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Very extended indie universe."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Reverse Cuomo?"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Yeah."
01:51:58;01:52:03;"Yeah, but in terms of-- yeah, I guess Mayer probably came out in the '90s almost."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"But Projector is an MGMT."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"Started in Connecticut."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"That's tight."
01:52:09;01:52:13;"In the twin cities, New Haven and Middletown."
01:52:13;01:52:16;"The twin cities of Connecticut."
01:52:17;01:52:18;"Ivy Leagues or--"
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Yeah."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"Sort of, I don't know."
01:52:20;01:52:21;"Good colleges."
01:52:21;01:52:24;"Well, where's Connecticut College?"
01:52:24;01:52:25;"I don't know."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"New London?"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"I was about to say that."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"I think so, yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"I don't know anything about Connecticut College."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"Tracy Chapman went to high school in Connecticut."
01:52:36;01:52:37;"OK."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"Really?"
01:52:38;01:52:39;"Apparently."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"According to--"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"I think we're going to cover Tracy on a future ep."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"A little teaser there."
01:52:51;01:52:52;"A little peek behind the curtain."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"TC does loosely plan shows."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"That's true."
01:52:58;01:52:59;"We've got--"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"I'm not talking about Tracy Chapman."
01:53:00;01:53:03;"Whether we actually ever do is a whole other question."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"We work hard to come up with the concepts."
01:53:06;01:53:09;"We work really hard to make it seem like we're not trying."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"That's right."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"That's my approach to everything."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"I mean, people know this show is fully scripted, right?"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"Every word that we say is written--"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Wait, by the way, wait, didn't somebody hit the thread"
01:53:19;01:53:23;"with this insane Jam Band Reddit post?"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"Oh, that was me."
01:53:24;01:53:27;"Yeah, you want to read it out as we listen to Expose."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Yeah, yeah."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"That's a good way to go out."
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Hang on."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"It's going to take me a second to pull up here."

01:53:33;01:53:34;"You are feeling?"
01:53:34;01:53:35;"Oh, yeah."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"Yeah, this is a tweet I'd come across."

01:55:20;01:55:22;"they're doing a new version of the song,"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"but it's planned in the sense that"

01:55:26;01:55:29;"Everything that's ever happened in the history of the world"
01:55:29;01:55:30;"was leading to this moment."

01:55:38;01:55:40;"in that sense, it's planned,"

01:55:48;01:55:50;"You know, what do you mean by that?"
01:55:50;01:55:55;"Yeah, no, you get into weird kind of semantics of like,"
01:55:55;01:56:00;"exactly, what does it mean to be truly free?"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"If you ask a psychic,"
01:56:02;01:56:05;"a psychic might find a Jam Band show very boring."

01:56:06;01:56:07;"I just saw it all coming."
01:56:07;01:56:09;"You gotta understand for a very talented psychic,"

01:56:11;01:56:13;"it's the exact same as seeing Taylor Swift"

01:56:14;01:56:17;"I've been watching a lot of dead YouTubes"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"as I'm going to sleep at night."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"It's kind of a nice mellow,"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"although sometimes you'll get one more Saturday"
01:56:24;01:56:27;"and you're just drifting off"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"after like a nice, like, you know,"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"like eight minute he's gone."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"Wait, you're listening on headphones?"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"No, no, watching, like just on the TV in our bedroom,"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"just like on YouTube."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"What's Hannah doing?"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"She's like on her phone or just kind of asleep or watching."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"So who turns it off?"
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Usually me."
01:56:43;01:56:44;"Plays all night long?"
01:56:44;01:56:47;"No, eventually the Bobby number kicks in."
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Yeah, we got to turn this off."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"But I was going to say like,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"you know, watching Jerry play these solos of her songs,"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"I know they're like, the solos are thrilling"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"because I know he's usually kind of playing around"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"the main melody."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"And it's like the slight deviations"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"from the expected melody"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"and the slight variation in the phrasing"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"that are like thrilling as a fan."
01:57:12;01:57:15;"And that's, I wouldn't say it's improvised, but..."
01:57:15;01:57:17;"Yeah, if we were talking to this woman,"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"we'd have to ask her,"
01:57:19;01:57:23;"what do you mean by planned?"
01:57:23;01:57:26;"Would she say they literally got to, did they,"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"for instance..."
01:57:28;01:57:30;"Yeah, they're just randomly hitting the fretboard?"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Are you implying that in practice"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"they played this exact version?"
01:57:34;01:57:37;"Because we more or less know that's not true."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"She just might be psychic."
01:57:39;01:57:42;"They, and what do you mean, they clearly planned?"
01:57:42;01:57:44;"Yeah, it's like if you could see,"
01:57:44;01:57:47;"if you could see like the essence of everything,"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"you would probably use words like planned"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"a bit differently."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"Yeah, I mean, true improvisation would just be"
01:57:53;01:57:56;"just not thinking and just putting your hands on,"
01:57:56;01:57:59;"your fingers on random fretboards and random strings."
01:57:59;01:58:03;"And even then, randomness is a concept."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"I might not be able to explain it."
01:58:05;01:58:07;"I've had this conversation a few times"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"where you talk about, you know,"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"whether or not there's an order to the universe"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"or a destiny or whatever."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"And people say, I, you know,"
01:58:15;01:58:18;"coincidences are things that appear to have a shape."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Well, the world is just so big,"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"the universe is so big and chaotic and random"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"that of course certain things appear to have a shape."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"You know, people who believe in"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"that there's no such thing as a coincidence,"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"that there's a destiny or a story"
01:58:30;01:58:33;"to what happens in the universe."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"And I don't know who's right,"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"but we also got to keep in mind that"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"chaos and randomness are also concepts."
01:58:39;01:58:41;"You know what I mean?"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"Yes, just as order is like, yeah, sure."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"Yeah, I'm just saying you get into some like"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"kind of out there like form and emptiness type stuff."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"The idea of being like, well, this is clearly chaos."
01:58:49;01:58:52;"You know, even that is like, well, says who?"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"Right, there might be an underlying order"
01:58:54;01:58:57;"that we can't see. Is that what you mean?"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"Yeah, and even, you know, which one wins out?"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"It depends how you look at it."
01:59:01;01:59:05;"Is order just another chaotic part of chaos"
01:59:05;01:59:10;"or is chaos a part of order?"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"I remember reading years ago"
01:59:12;01:59:15;"that it was very hard for computer programmers"
01:59:15;01:59:18;"to program a computer to spit out a random series of numbers."
01:59:18;01:59:21;"Oh, quote unquote random number generator."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"That makes no sense to me."
01:59:23;01:59:26;"Yeah, I can't. I mean, wouldn't anything be random?"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"Well, I think if it just is like"
01:59:28;01:59:31;"four, nine, three, five, six, zero, two."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"How do you program that?"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"Zero through nine."
01:59:34;01:59:37;"And it's just like,"
01:59:37;01:59:39;"I'm not a computer programmer, but you could just..."
01:59:39;01:59:43;"Explain it in code."
01:59:43;01:59:46;"Okay, backslash colon."
01:59:46;01:59:48;"No, I just like, there's got to be a way to like,"
01:59:48;01:59:52;"there's only nine or ten, I guess it's ten digits,"
01:59:52;01:59:54;"zero through nine."
01:59:54;01:59:56;"So you just have it."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"My understanding..."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"It's like the lotto ball."
02:00:00;02:00:03;"Because you know, like, if you flip a coin"
02:00:03;02:00:06;"a billion times, usually one side eventually"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"nudges up to like 50.5%"
02:00:08;02:00:11;"because it's not totally random."
02:00:11;02:00:14;"There is a small tendency for one side"
02:00:14;02:00:18;"based on weight or something to land heads up"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"or something like that."
02:00:20;02:00:23;"Just saying, like, when you actually try to create"
02:00:23;02:00:26;"anything that's programmed is ordered."
02:00:26;02:00:29;"So to create an ordered system"
02:00:29;02:00:31;"that truly creates chaos,"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"it's a little bit of a paradox."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"Yeah."
02:00:34;02:00:36;"Like even for example, you say, I create,"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"I have ten things, I built a machine"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"and drops them on the floor."
02:00:40;02:00:42;"So it's pure chaos, right?"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"Well, somebody else like this guy's wife might say"
02:00:44;02:00:46;"it's not chaos at all."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"Over a long enough time frame, the logic of"
02:00:48;02:00:53;"how gravity and this set of ten things falls,"
02:00:53;02:00:54;"there's order to it."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"Here's Slate, the website."
02:00:56;02:00:58;"It says, you can't program a computer"
02:00:58;02:01:01;"to produce true randomness wherein no element"
02:01:01;02:01:03;"has any consistent rule-based relationship"
02:01:03;02:01:05;"to any other element because"
02:01:05;02:01:07;"then it wouldn't be random."
02:01:07;02:01:08;"And there you have it."
02:01:08;02:01:09;"But couldn't you just have it?"
02:01:09;02:01:11;"Jam bands are a scam."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"Gotcha."
02:01:12;02:01:13;"Wow."
02:01:13;02:01:15;"I'm tripped up on this."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"This is not intuitive to me."
02:01:17;02:01:19;"I'm not good at this kind of stuff."
02:01:19;02:01:21;"Sometimes this kind of stuff comes up and I'm like..."
02:01:21;02:01:22;"I just think..."
02:01:22;02:01:24;"When people are like, oh, you have no free will"
02:01:24;02:01:25;"and you're like, what?"
02:01:25;02:01:27;"Like, I do."
02:01:27;02:01:28;"You think you do."
02:01:28;02:01:30;"I could choose to eat this..."
02:01:30;02:01:32;"No, but there's a half-eaten burrito in front of me."
02:01:32;02:01:34;"I can choose to eat it or not eat it."
02:01:34;02:01:35;"It's up to me."
02:01:35;02:01:37;"But also, you're making assumptions about"
02:01:37;02:01:40;"the nature of time, which science has never"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"given us consistent answers about."
02:01:42;02:01:44;"It's your experience."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"I mean, I guess I'm already full,"
02:01:46;02:01:48;"so that's why I'm choosing not to eat the burrito."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"But you know what?"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"See, now I am going to eat the burrito."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"And yet you're not."
02:01:53;02:01:57;"And yet you're not, Mr. Longstrap."
02:01:57;02:02:00;"Of course we had calculated that at the last minute"
02:02:00;02:02:03;"you would take a cheeky bite of that burrito,"
02:02:03;02:02:05;"Mr. Longstrap."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"Come, come, Mr. Longstrap."
02:02:07;02:02:09;"Surely you don't believe your free will"
02:02:09;02:02:12;"led you to bite that burrito one last time."
02:02:12;02:02:14;"Is this Atticus Finch?"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"We're back."
02:02:16;02:02:21;"It's me, Atticus Ross, partner of Trent Reznor."
02:02:21;02:02:22;"I hear on..."
02:02:22;02:02:25;"We'll get you there, partner."
02:02:25;02:02:30;"Allow me to play a solo for you."
02:02:30;02:02:32;"I think you might enjoy it."
02:02:32;02:02:33;"I think we need to..."
02:02:33;02:02:34;"You know what?"
02:02:34;02:02:36;"This is a funny way to go out."
02:02:36;02:02:38;"It's the perfect way to go."
02:02:38;02:02:39;"We're just hitting our stride."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"Too bad it's the end of the episode."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"But you know what?"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"If anybody has any thoughts on this"
02:02:43;02:02:47;"or good, readable articles about, you know,"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"jam bands, the nature of free will,"
02:02:50;02:02:53;"if an ordered bass system can ever produce"
02:02:53;02:02:54;"true randomness or chaos,"
02:02:54;02:02:55;"let us know."
02:02:55;02:02:57;"And you know what I would like after..."
02:02:57;02:03:00;"Seinfeld, you check on the legality of this."
02:03:00;02:03:03;"But maybe after the show in Austin,"
02:03:03;02:03:06;"we all meet up, have a little birthday party,"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"we blaze a fatty,"
02:03:08;02:03:10;"and we kind of dig into some of these"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"philosophical conversations."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"And if we can't get to the bottom of it,"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"we'll go have a nice big plate of ribs"
02:03:16;02:03:19;"and ice cold Scheinerbach."
02:03:19;02:03:20;"Sounds great."
02:03:20;02:03:22;"That's what I want for my birthday."
02:03:22;02:03:24;"Alright, see everybody next time."
02:03:24;02:03:25;"Peace!"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"Time Crisis"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"with Ezra Koenig"
