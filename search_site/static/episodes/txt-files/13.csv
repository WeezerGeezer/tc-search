00:00;00:04;"It's early morning."
00:04;00:08;"Two men emerge from a Christmas mist."
00:08;00:14;"Me, Ezra Koenig, and poet/painter Jake Longstreth."
00:14;00:19;"We meet with hot chocolates in our hands and enter the Time Crisis studio, and we're going"
00:19;00:25;"to take phone calls from Rashida Jones, Alana Haim, and some fans."
00:25;00:27;"This is Time Crisis Christmas."
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
05:08;05:11;"That was the kinks with Father Christmas."
05:11;05:13;"Thanks for coming over so early, Jake."
05:13;05:15;"Yeah, man. Tired."
05:15;05:17;"There are probably some people still up, listening."
05:17;05:19;"Yeah. I hope so."
05:19;05:21;"We're dedicated, so we're here."
05:21;05:22;"That's right."
05:22;05:23;"That song was pretty good."
05:23;05:24;"Yeah, that's a good one."
05:24;05:27;"That was kind of the kinks getting a little punky."
05:27;05:28;"Mm-hmm."
05:28;05:30;"Late '70s kinks."
05:30;05:35;"That's one of the few Christmas rock songs that has its own integrity."
05:35;05:38;"It's not just pure novelty."
05:38;05:43;"I could listen to that song, or I could hear that song any time of the year"
05:43;05:44;"and be like, ""Yeah, that's a good song."""
05:44;05:46;"Right. I know what you mean."
05:46;05:48;"Not all Christmas songs have integrity."
05:48;05:51;"You know what happens to me when people just make these trash Christmas songs"
05:51;05:52;"just to get something out?"
05:52;05:53;"Right."
05:53;05:55;"Or for just some random compilation or something?"
05:55;06:02;"You know what, to me, is the most integrity-possessing move?"
06:02;06:06;"Is when a Christmas song is just on your regular album."
06:06;06:07;"That is strong."
06:07;06:08;"You know what I mean?"
06:08;06:13;"Because it's not like Michael Buble, ""Okay, here's your Christmas album"
06:13;06:22;"that you're going to have at $6.99 at Target as a classic stocking stuffer."""
06:22;06:26;"It really shows that you have a love of Christmas, a love of Christianity,"
06:26;06:31;"when you actually put a Christmas song, just like track 7 on your album."
06:31;06:36;"The Everly Brothers, 1971 album, ""Stories We Tell Ourselves."""
06:36;06:39;"There's a song called ""Christmas Eve Can Kill You."""
06:39;06:40;"Whoa."
06:40;06:41;"Beautiful song."
06:41;06:43;"And that was not a Christmas album."
06:43;06:45;"Nope, straight-up album."
06:45;06:46;"Let's do it."
06:47;06:50;"Here's a Christmas song with some real integrity from the Everly Brothers,"
06:50;06:52;"""Christmas Eve Can Kill You."""

19:48;19:49;"Respect."
19:49;19:51;"That's a Christmas song with integrity."
19:51;19:56;"While we're here, I thought it was also a good time to reflect on the past year,"
19:56;19:58;"the past season of Time Crisis,"
19:58;20:02;"and maybe call some members of the Time Crisis family, people who have been on the show."
20:02;20:03;"Love it."
20:03;20:05;"That's what you're supposed to do, you know, wish people well."
20:05;20:13;"All right, so let's give a call to a multiple episode alum of Time Crisis, Rashida Jones."
20:13;20:15;"[phone ringing]"
20:15;20:17;"Hey, Rashida, you there?"
20:17;20:18;"I'm here."
20:18;20:20;"Happy holidays."
20:20;20:21;"Happy holidays."
20:21;20:22;"Sorry to call you so early."
20:22;20:23;"It's early."
20:23;20:25;"Yeah, what's up with that?"
20:25;20:30;"I think it's because we wanted English people to get to listen to the show."
20:30;20:31;"That's sweet."
20:31;20:33;"It's kind of a late night thing for the people in LA."
20:33;20:39;"So, Rashida, we were just talking about the fact that you're now part of Christmas history"
20:39;20:42;"because you appeared in a Christmas special."
20:42;20:45;"Do you want to call that Christmas-tory?"
20:45;20:47;"You're now part of Christmas-tory."
20:47;20:48;"Yeah."
20:48;20:50;"You've appeared in a Christmas special."
20:50;20:52;"You're like--you want to tell us about it?"
20:52;20:54;"It's the Bill Murray Christmas special."
20:54;20:59;"Yeah, I mean, I will say it definitely is a dream come true to be on a Christmas special."
20:59;21:06;"I watched a lot as a kid, obviously Charlie Brown, Bob Hope."
21:06;21:11;"You know, there's something really cozy about a Christmas special."
21:11;21:18;"And I feel Christmas special, having been in one, now that will live on forever,"
21:18;21:23;"especially because it's Bill Murray, who is--he's a man, you know?"
21:23;21:24;"He's a Christmas legend."
21:24;21:26;"Also, he appeared in Scrooged."
21:26;21:27;"Oh, yeah."
21:27;21:28;"That's right."
21:28;21:29;"That's a history with a holiday."
21:29;21:31;"Scrooged is a modern classic."
21:31;21:32;"Absolutely."
21:32;21:33;"Yeah."
21:33;21:36;"So you sang in the Bill Murray Christmas special."
21:36;21:38;"You and Jason Schwartzman sang a song."
21:38;21:39;"What song was it?"
21:39;21:45;"We sang ""I Saw the Light,"" which is a classic Todd Rundgren song."
21:45;21:47;"But not a Christmas song?"
21:47;21:53;"Not a Christmas song, but weirdly fits in well with the Christmas lexicon of music, I think."
21:53;21:58;"Well, I guess thanks to you and Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, it's now a Christmas song."
21:58;22:01;"So you want to introduce it to everybody listening at home?"
22:01;22:03;"I'd love that, yeah."
22:03;22:05;"Why not?"
22:05;22:06;"Oh, right now?"
22:06;22:07;"Please do it now."
22:07;22:08;"Yes, please."
22:08;22:09;"Thank you."
22:09;22:15;"This is the new Christmas classic, ""I Saw the Light,"" by Todd Rundgren."
22:23;22:31;"Because late last night I was feeling something wasn't right"
22:31;22:39;"There was not another soul in sight Only you, only you"
22:39;22:47;"So we walked along Though I knew that there was something wrong"
22:47;22:55;"And a feeling that feels so strong About you"
22:55;23:03;"Then you gazed up at me And the answer was plain to see"
23:03;23:11;"'Cause I saw the light in your eyes"
23:11;23:19;"In your eyes So behind all claims"
23:19;23:27;"I just never would suspect a thing So that little bell began to ring"
23:27;23:35;"In my head, in my head But I tried to run"
23:35;23:43;"Though I knew it wouldn't help me none 'Cause I couldn't ever love no one"
23:43;23:51;"But so I said But my feelings for you"
23:51;24:03;"Were just something I never knew 'Til I saw the light in your eyes"
24:03;24:07;"In your eyes"
24:23;24:31;"But I love you best It's not something that I say in jest"
24:31;24:39;"'Cause you're different though from all the rest In my eyes"
24:39;24:47;"And I ran out before But I won't do it anymore"
24:47;24:53;"Can't you see the light in my eyes?"
24:53;25:05;"In my eyes"
25:13;25:27;"When you've had enough of stalking on your own It's the time that every santa has a bone"
25:27;25:35;"Does he ride a reindeer? Does he turn upon his sleigh?"
25:35;25:46;"To a fair is keeping sober for the day So here it is, merry Christmas"

26:16;26:24;"Has your granny always tell you That the old santa's all the best?"
26:24;26:31;"And she's up and gone and all in with the rest"

27:01;27:09;"Are you hanging up the stocking on your wall?"
27:09;27:16;"Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?"
27:16;27:23;"Do you ride off down the hillside In a bonnie you have made?"
27:23;27:30;"When you land upon your hand and you've been slain"
27:30;27:39;"So here it is, merry Christmas Everybody's having fun"

32:31;32:34;"America, we're just having a reggae New Year's Eve"
32:35;32:38;"Hey, hey, hey"
32:38;32:41;"That was Brian Adams with Reggae Christmas."
32:41;32:47;"Before that we heard Christmas Time in the Mountains by Palace Songs, aka Will Oldham."
32:47;32:51;"And before that we heard Merry Christmas Everybody by Slade."
32:51;32:53;"1973 I want to say."
32:53;32:55;"You know that band Ezra? Slade?"
32:55;32:57;"Yeah, they were like glam."
32:57;32:58;"Yeah."
32:58;32:59;"Glam rock."
32:59;33:04;"Sounds like kind of like contemporaries of Kiss but kind of better."
33:04;33:06;"And more British."
33:06;33:07;"Yeah."
33:07;33:09;"Yeah, probably like Bowie too."
33:09;33:10;"Yeah, totally."
33:10;33:12;"Surprised Bowie didn't do a Christmas song."
33:12;33:13;"Maybe he did."
33:13;33:14;"Well, he did."
33:14;33:20;"I remember being a kid and on like VH1 or something they'd always show like weird videos"
33:20;33:25;"on Christmas and they would always show, I don't know if it was like released on a record,"
33:25;33:31;"but they would show Bowie singing with Bing Crosby on Bing Crosby's like 70s Christmas special."
33:31;33:32;"Do you remember that?"
33:32;33:33;"Okay, no I don't actually."
33:33;33:38;"And they did like a weird version of Little Drummer Boy."
33:38;33:39;"Huh."
33:39;33:43;"I meant like a Bowie pinned Christmas song."
33:43;33:45;"Seems like he might have done it."
33:45;33:46;"You know what?"
33:46;33:49;"Okay, he didn't exactly write his own Christmas song but I think we could do a little Bowie"
33:49;33:53;"Christmas blog because he did sing Little Drummer Boy and then he does kind of like"
33:53;33:59;"the spoken word bridge of Do They Know It's Christmas."
33:59;34:00;"By?"
34:00;34:04;"By all the, you remember like Bob Geldof and everybody they did like the."
34:04;34:06;"Oh yeah."
34:06;34:11;"Okay, let's listen to Bowie singing with Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy and then"
34:11;34:13;"let's get into Do They Know It's Christmas."
34:13;34:15;"That one bears some discussion."
34:15;34:19;"Hello."
34:19;34:21;"You the new butler?"
34:21;34:24;"It's been a long time since I've been the new anything."
34:24;34:26;"What's happened to Hudson?"
34:26;34:27;"I guess he's changing."
34:27;34:30;"Yeah, he does that a lot doesn't he?"
34:30;34:32;"I'm David Bowie, I live down the road."
34:32;34:33;"Oh."
34:33;34:35;"Sir Percival lets me use his piano when he's not around."
34:35;34:36;"He's not around is he?"
34:36;34:38;"I can honestly say I haven't seen him but come on in."
34:38;34:39;"Come in."
34:39;34:41;"But come on in."
34:41;34:43;"Are you related to Sir Percival?"
34:43;34:44;"Well, distantly."
34:44;34:49;"Oh, you're not the poor relation from America, are you?"
34:49;34:51;"Gee, news sure travels fast doesn't it?"
34:51;34:52;"I'm Bing."
34:52;34:54;"Oh, I'm pleased to meet you."
34:54;34:55;"You're the one that sings right?"
34:55;34:57;"Well, right or wrong, I sing either way."
34:57;34:58;"Oh, I sing too."
34:58;35:00;"Oh good, what kind of singing?"
35:00;35:03;"Well, mostly the contemporary stuff."
35:03;35:05;"Do you like modern music?"
35:05;35:08;"Oh, I think it's marvellous, some of it really fine."
35:08;35:11;"Tell me, you ever listen to any of the older fellows?"
35:11;35:12;"Oh yeah, sure."
35:12;35:17;"I like John Lennon and the other one with Harry Nelson."
35:17;35:19;"Oh, you go back that far, huh?"
35:19;35:21;"Yeah, I'm not as young as I look."
35:21;35:22;"None of us is these days."
35:22;35:24;"In fact, I've got a six year old son."
35:24;35:27;"And he really gets excited around the Christmas holiday thing."
35:27;35:32;"Do you go in for any of the traditional things in the boy household Christmas town?"
35:32;35:34;"Oh yeah, most of them really."
35:34;35:39;"Presents, tree, decorations, agents sliding down the chimney."
35:39;35:40;"What?"
35:40;35:42;"I was just seeing if you were paying attention."
35:42;35:46;"Actually, our family do most of the things that other families do."
35:46;35:47;"We sing the same songs."
35:47;35:48;"Do you?"
35:48;35:49;"I even have a go at White Christmas."
35:49;35:51;"You do, huh?"
35:51;35:52;"And this one."
35:52;35:53;"This is my son's favourite."
35:53;35:54;"Do you know this one?"
35:54;35:55;"Oh, I do indeed."
35:55;35:56;"It's a lovely thing."
42:04;42:07;"So that was Band-Aid with Do They Know It's Christmas."
42:07;42:09;"You really never heard that song before, Jake?"
42:09;42:10;"Somehow that escaped me."
42:10;42:12;"It's one of the best-selling singles of all time."
42:12;42:13;"Really?"
42:13;42:17;"That's '84, which is the same year as We Are the World."
42:17;42:19;"I think We Are the World was inspired by this."
42:19;42:20;"Oh, really?"
42:20;42:23;"We Are the World is like the American Do They Know It's Christmas."
42:23;42:25;"Oh, maybe We Are the World's '85 then."
42:25;42:26;"It might be after."
42:26;42:31;"I think the story is Bob Geldof, lead singer of the Boomtown Rats,"
42:31;42:36;"wanted to do something, picked up the phone, got Bono, Sting."
42:36;42:37;"Heavy hitters."
42:37;42:40;"The guy from Duran Duran all in a room together."
42:40;42:41;"Boy George."
42:41;42:44;"Boy George, all the same, Bananarama."
42:44;42:45;"Maybe guys from Tears for Fears."
42:45;42:47;"Probably some guys from Tears for Fears."
42:47;42:50;"It raised a lot of money to feed the world,"
42:50;42:53;"notably certain nations in Africa that were starving."
42:53;42:56;"Although I think as time has gone on,"
42:56;42:59;"as much as people appreciate this song,"
42:59;43:01;"people feel a little weird about the sentiment."
43:01;43:03;"Why is that?"
43:03;43:06;"Because basically the idea of the song is"
43:06;43:09;"do they know it's Christmas time at all?"
43:09;43:13;"So basically it's like don't you realize that we're here in England"
43:13;43:16;"having an incredible Christmas while it's snowing"
43:16;43:20;"where in this place where these people are from,"
43:20;43:23;"the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears."
43:23;43:25;"Do they even know it's Christmas?"
43:25;43:28;"So obviously there's a lot of assumptions happening."
43:28;43:30;"One is that these starving people--"
43:30;43:34;"If they believed in Jesus Christ, maybe everything would be okay."
43:34;43:37;"I'm sure Bob Geldof would be mortified for that interpretation."
43:37;43:42;"But I think back in 1984 people said uncomfortable things like that."
43:42;43:47;"There's a good-hearted but maybe naive sort of colonialist energy."
43:47;43:49;"Yes, very colonialist."
43:49;43:51;"Do they even know it's Christmas?"
43:51;43:52;"I mean, do they?"
43:52;43:54;"I mean, well, we should tell them."
43:54;43:56;"Let's write a song about it."
43:56;43:59;"I mean, I still find it a moving song, but it's like,"
43:59;44:01;"do they know it's Christmas?"
44:01;44:03;"We know it's Christmas."
44:03;44:05;"Who cares if it's Christmas? Just feed the world."
44:05;44:07;"Feed the world is the important part."
44:07;44:10;"So then they took that ball and ran with it for We Are the World."
44:10;44:13;"They were just like, you know what? It's the summer. Let's do this."
44:13;44:15;"I think it was just the '80s,"
44:15;44:18;"like the first world is getting richer and richer."
44:18;44:19;"Yes, it's interesting."
44:19;44:22;"You got Reagan and Thatcher just crushing trade unions."
44:22;44:27;"A lot of money flowing upwards to the 1% of musicians."
44:27;44:29;"That's a weird time. I wonder what that's like."
44:29;44:32;"I can't even imagine."
44:32;44:35;"And then there's kind of like, you know what? Let's give back."
44:35;44:41;"Our governments have been kind of destroying the social safety net."
44:41;44:43;"Why don't we give back a little bit?"
44:43;44:46;"But you know what? Hey, I'm not dissing the musicians."
44:46;44:49;"They definitely raise money for people."
44:49;44:53;"Okay, but I do need to say that I thought that David Bowie was on Do They Know It's Christmas?"
44:53;44:55;"But he's actually on the B-side."
44:55;44:58;"I own this seven-inch single."
44:58;45:01;"I want to play you the part where Bowie does like this weird spoken word."
45:01;45:04;"Almost like his part in Under Pressure."
45:04;45:06;"Bowie's got a great talking voice."
45:06;45:11;"Okay, so this is the extended mix of Do They Know It's Christmas?"
45:11;45:16;"I guess they got so many people wanted to be on the song that they couldn't."
45:16;45:21;"There are too many stars, and I vividly remember listening to this version and hearing Bowie talk."
45:21;45:22;"England right now is pumped."
45:22;45:23;"Okay, here it is."
45:23;45:25;"This is David Bowie."
45:25;45:28;"It's Christmas 1984."
45:28;45:32;"And there are more starving folk on that planet than ever before."
45:32;45:38;"Please give a thought for them this season and do whatever you can, however small, to help them live."
45:38;45:40;"Have a peaceful new year."
45:40;45:45;"This record was recorded on the 25th of November 1984."
45:45;45:47;"It's now 8 a.m. in the morning of the 26th."
45:47;45:49;"We've been here 24 hours."
45:49;45:50;"This is super weird."
45:50;45:57;"Okay, so obviously David Bowie and Paul McCartney and all these guys were basically just mailing in their recording."
45:57;46:01;"They're like, ""We can't make the real session, but we'll record something for the B-side."""
46:01;46:02;"Let's go back and listen to that Bowie."
46:02;46:05;"Clearly recording it--I mean, this is 1984, so people don't have phones."
46:05;46:09;"This sounds like he recorded it on his phone outdoors."
46:09;46:11;"Please give a thought for them this season and do whatever you can, however small, to help them live."
46:11;46:12;"You hear all that echo?"
46:12;46:14;"And all that ambient noise?"
46:14;46:15;"Road noise?"
46:15;46:16;"Yeah."
46:16;46:18;"Bowie's just driving."
46:18;46:22;"This record was recorded on the 25th of November 1984."
46:22;46:24;"Whatever. Still a classic song."
46:24;46:28;"And probably that song is still raising money for--really?"
46:28;46:30;"I don't know. For starving people?"
46:30;46:34;"I always wonder about that when you buy some old album and there's, like,"
46:34;46:40;"""Send correspondence to the fan club at this random address that was there 30 years ago."""
46:40;46:43;"And you're like, ""What would happen if you sent it there?"""
46:43;46:49;"If someone buys that song on iTunes, I doubt there's some sort of fund that's still active."
46:49;46:51;"Well, somebody's getting paid for it."
46:51;46:52;"Oh, I bet there is."
46:52;46:54;"That would be a real travesty."
46:54;46:56;"Because you could buy this song on iTunes."
46:56;47:01;"If we found out that that money was not going to starving people, that'd be a crime against humanity."
47:01;47:03;"Apple's in hot water now, dude."
47:03;47:05;"Well, no, that's not on Apple."
47:05;47:07;"Well, if you bought it on iTunes."
47:07;47:10;"Yeah, but it's on the record company or whoever released it."
47:10;47:12;"That is such a ""This American Life."""
47:12;47:13;"Right."
47:13;47:18;"Band-Aid ""Duly Notes Christmas,"" one of the best-selling singles of all time."
47:18;47:26;"It released in 1984. It raised over $40 million for people suffering from the famines of the '80s."
47:26;47:28;"However, as the song..."
47:28;47:31;"[laughter]"
47:31;47:36;"However, I bought the song the other day to listen to with my wife and child,"
47:36;47:40;"and I could not but wonder, ""Where's the money going now?"""
47:40;47:46;"And then it's like 40 minutes of phone calls to lawyers, dodging questions."
47:46;47:48;"Oh, man."
47:48;47:51;"So it turns out that one and a half cents goes to Africa."
47:51;47:53;"Really makes you think."
47:53;47:54;"Merry Christmas, everybody."
47:54;47:56;"Merry Christmas, everybody."
47:56;47:58;"Well, everybody, do your research."
47:58;48:02;"Anytime you give to charity, you gotta do your due diligence."
48:02;48:04;"And that includes when you buy a charitable single."
48:04;48:06;"That's 30 years old."
48:06;48:10;"Especially one that's 30 years old."
48:10;48:13;"You know, it's not exactly a Christmas song, but we've been talking about that."
48:13;48:16;"That was the British big charity single of the '80s."
48:16;48:20;"The big American charity single of the '80s, put together by Rashida's dad."
48:20;48:21;"""We Are the World,"" right?"
48:21;48:22;"""We Are the World."""
48:22;48:23;"Yeah."
48:23;48:24;"I mean, we're American. I think we might as well play that."
48:24;48:27;"Let's go for it, yeah. It's fitting for Christmas."
48:27;48:28;"""We Are the World."""
48:30;48:33;"USA for Africa, ""We Are the World."""
48:33;48:34;"Now, in this song, we're gonna hear..."
48:34;48:37;"It was solid eight minutes."
48:37;48:39;"It's exactly eight minutes."
48:39;48:40;"[laughs]"
48:46;48:47;"Who starts it? MJ?"
48:55;48:56;"Okay."
48:56;48:57;"Gucci."
49:11;49:12;"Paul Simon."
49:21;49:22;"Loggins."
49:22;49:23;"No, that's Kenny Rogers, dude."
49:23;49:24;"[laughs] Rogers."
49:30;49:32;"Is that Teddy?"
49:32;49:34;"Ooh, Tina."
49:34;49:36;"Ooh, she sounds great."
49:40;49:42;"Billy."
49:42;49:44;"Joel, like a couple years past his prime."
49:50;49:52;"Jake and I are watching the video."
49:52;49:57;"We gotta point out that Michael is wearing, like, his full shiny socks."
49:57;49:58;"Classic look."
49:58;50:02;"Uh, military look."
50:02;50:06;"The way they panned on Michael, they started at his shoes and panned up his entire body."
50:20;50:21;"Dion."
50:27;50:28;"Willie is so distinctive."
50:31;50:33;"Wow."
50:33;50:36;"Willie is one of those dudes that's kind of like always been old."
50:36;50:37;"Yeah."
50:37;50:39;"I mean, how old is he? In his 80s?"
50:39;50:40;"Yeah."
50:40;50:41;"That's incredible."
50:41;50:42;"Oh, yeah."
50:42;50:43;"Bruce at his prime."
50:50;50:52;"That's Loggins."
50:52;50:53;"Oh, is it?"
50:53;50:55;"Yeah, that's Loggins."
50:55;50:56;"Ooh."
50:56;50:57;"[laughs]"
50:57;50:58;"Steve Perry."
51:04;51:05;"Daryl."
51:05;51:06;"Okay."
51:12;51:14;"MJ's got shades on."
51:27;51:28;"Lopper."
51:57;51:58;"[laughs]"
51:58;51:59;"Oh, God."
52:00;52:01;"The man."
52:02;52:03;"All right, that's enough."
52:03;52:04;"We made it to Dylan."
52:04;52:05;"[laughs]"
52:06;52:07;"Oh, my God."
52:26;52:27;"We made it to Dylan."
52:36;52:48;"If we make it through December, everything's gonna be all right, I know."
52:48;53:00;"It's the coldest time of winter, and I shiver when I see the falling snow."
53:00;53:12;"If we make it through December, got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime, maybe"
53:12;53:16;"even California."
53:16;53:23;"If we make it through December, we'll be fine."
53:23;53:34;"Got laid off down at the factory, and their time is not the greatest in the world."
53:34;53:39;"Heaven knows I've been working hard."
53:39;53:45;"I wanted Christmas to be right for Daddy's girl."
53:45;53:49;"I don't mean to hit December."
53:49;54:03;"It's meant to be the happy time of year, but my little girl don't understand why Daddy"
54:03;54:09;"can't afford no Christmas here."
54:09;54:21;"If we make it through December, everything's gonna be all right, I know."
54:21;54:32;"It's the coldest time of winter, and I shiver when I see the falling snow."
54:32;54:44;"If we make it through December, got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime, maybe"
54:44;54:49;"even California."
54:49;54:52;"If we make it through December, we'll be fine."
54:52;55:16;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
55:16;55:22;"That's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin."
55:22;55:28;"He didn't come down the chimney, so Mama must have let him in."
55:28;55:33;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
55:33;55:40;"Well they thought I was fast asleep, and they thought I was tucked in bed."
55:40;55:46;"They never thought that I'd come a-peepin', or that I'd hear what was said."
55:46;55:51;"Santa put his arm around Mama, and Mama put her arm around him."
55:51;55:57;"So if Santa Claus ain't Daddy, then I'm a-gonna tell on them."
55:57;56:03;"Well Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:03;56:09;"That's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin."
56:09;56:15;"He didn't come down the chimney, so Mama must have let him in."
56:15;56:27;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:27;56:33;"I never saw a dancer, a prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring."
56:33;56:38;"I never saw the red-nosed reindeer, like the show on the TV screen."
56:38;56:44;"But he sure brought a lot of presents, so Santa Claus he must have been."
56:44;56:50;"Santa sure looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:50;56:56;"Well Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
56:56;57:02;"That's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin."
57:02;57:08;"He didn't come down the chimney, so Mama must have let him in."
57:08;57:15;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
57:15;57:26;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
57:26;57:36;"Last year I hung my stocking by the chimney, and old Santa didn't bring me anything."
57:36;57:43;"I went down the road, I knowed, and I told him what to bring me, but I didn't even hear"
57:43;57:44;"his sleigh bells ring."
57:44;57:45;"So to heck with old Santa Claus."
57:45;57:46;"When he goes dashing through the snow, I hope he falls."
57:46;57:47;"I'd like to hit him in his hole, hole, hole, with a bunch of big snowballs."
57:47;57:48;"To heck with old Santa Claus."
57:48;57:49;"I never saw a dancer, a prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring."
57:49;57:50;"I never saw the red-nosed reindeer, like the show on the TV screen."
57:50;57:51;"But he sure brought a lot of presents, so Santa Claus he must have been."
57:51;57:52;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
57:53;57:54;"That's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin."
57:54;58:18;"I never saw a dancer, a prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring."
58:18;58:44;"I never saw the red-nosed reindeer, like the show on the TV screen."
58:44;59:12;"That's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was much too thin."
59:12;59:42;"Santa looked a lot like Daddy, our Daddy looked a lot like him."
59:42;01:00:11;"Santa looked a lot like him."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Santa looked a lot like him."
01:00:35;01:00:41;"Santa looked a lot like him."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"Good catch."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Do you have one?"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I mean, honestly."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I'm drawn."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"If I'm honest."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Oh, Scrooge."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Scrooge is good."
01:01:05;01:01:09;"If I'm honest, even though it's a very problematic film,"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"the Christmas movie I've watched the most"
01:01:11;01:01:15;"that influenced my vision of what Christmas is"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"is Home Alone."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Word."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"I mean, I've just seen it a billion times."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Like, the music."
01:01:21;01:01:26;"We've been playing a lot today as we speak."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"The music, the atmosphere,"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"just the ultra-violence against home intruders,"
01:01:31;01:01:35;"all of that was very influential to me as a child."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"But you know one thing that bothered me about it"
01:01:37;01:01:41;"is that my PC police liberal non-violent parents"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"always gave me a hard time about it."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"Really?"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"My mom would always see me watching"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"and be like, ""This movie's disgusting."""
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Are you serious?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Yeah, no, she really thought the violence wasn't funny."
01:01:50;01:01:55;"And I was like, ""Mom, Joe Pesci's head just got lit"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"on fire by a blowtorch."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"It's funny."""
01:01:57;01:02:00;"I was like, ""Daniel Stern just stepped on a nail."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"It's funny."""
01:02:01;01:02:03;"And she would always say, ""No, this is not funny,"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"and I don't know why this is children's entertainment."""
01:02:05;01:02:08;"That's why I moved out."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"Parents just don't understand."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"Anyway, back into some Christmas music."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"We were talking before about Christmas songs with integrity,"
01:02:15;01:02:19;"Christmas songs that are on regular albums,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"not waiting for the Christmas stocking stuffer rush."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"And one of the best of all time"
01:02:24;01:02:30;"has got to be the Pogues' ""Fairy Tale of New York,"""
01:02:30;01:02:32;"which was on a regular Pogues album."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"And that made me think a little bit about"
01:02:34;01:02:37;"how much I love Irish music and how even non-Christmas"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"Irish music has a bit of Christmas in it."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"That's just--I don't know why I think that."
01:02:43;01:02:46;"But anyway, let's kick things off with Pogues' ""Fairy Tale of New York"""
01:02:46;01:02:48;"and then listen to a little bit of Irish music."
01:02:48;01:02:53;"# It was Christmas Eve, babe"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"# In the drunk tank"
01:02:57;01:03:01;"# An old man said to me"
01:03:01;01:03:05;"# ""Go and see another one"""
01:03:05;01:03:10;"# And I only sang a song"

01:03:14;01:03:18;"# I turned my face away"
01:03:18;01:03:22;"# And dreamed about you"

01:03:27;01:03:31;"# Climbing like ten to one"
01:03:31;01:03:35;"# I've got a feeling"
01:03:35;01:03:39;"# This year is for making you"
01:03:39;01:03:44;"# So happy Christmas"
01:03:44;01:03:48;"# I love you, baby"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"# I can see a better time"
01:03:52;01:03:57;"# When all our dreams come true"

01:04:12;01:04:15;"# But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"# When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"# You promised me Broadway was waiting for me"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"# You were handsome"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"# You were pretty, queen of New York City"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"# When the band finished playing, they held out for more"
01:04:27;01:04:30;"# Sinatra was swinging, all the gentlemen were singing"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"# We kissed on the corner, then danced through the night"
01:04:33;01:04:37;"# The boys of the NY Piddy Choir were singing"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"# You'd come on my way"
01:04:39;01:04:43;"# And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day"
01:04:43;01:04:56;"# You're a bum, you're a punk"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"# You're a house slut and jumbler"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"# There on the stand on a dripping night bed"
01:05:01;01:05:04;"# You scumbag, you mugger, chitchy, lousy, faggot"
01:05:04;01:05:07;"# You'd lose your arse, I'd lay gun and teller"
01:05:07;01:05:11;"# The boys of the NY Piddy Choir are still singing"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"# You're a wetbag"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"# And the bells are ringing out for Christmas Day"
01:05:17;01:05:30;"# I could have been someone"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"# Well, so could anyone"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"# You took my dreams from me"
01:05:36;01:05:39;"# When I first found you"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"# I kept them with me, babe"

01:06:03;01:06:05;"#"
01:07:04;01:07:09;"That was the Pogues' Fairytale of New York. Beautiful Christmas song."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Yeah, that's awesome."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"In a lot of movies and stuff. In the film Basquiat."
01:07:14;01:07:21;"It's interesting to write a melody that somehow evokes that sort of classic Christmas feeling."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Right."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"You know what I mean?"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Yeah, yeah."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"It's very anthemic."
01:07:25;01:07:29;"[Humming]"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"It sounds Christmassy."
01:07:30;01:07:35;"I feel that way about that John Lennon song, ""Happy Christmas, War is Over."""
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Oh yeah, also very Christmassy."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"That's like one of the good ones. We should listen to that later."
01:07:39;01:07:45;"Now let's listen to some non-Christmas Irish music, but it still kind of is stirring in a way."
01:07:45;01:07:51;"And when we come out of this block, this rock block of Irish music, we can take some Christmas phone calls from the fans."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"Sweet."
01:07:52;01:07:55;"Opening up the floodgates for the first time on Tom Crisis."
01:07:55;01:08:00;"So to kick things off, here's Johnny Cash with his stirring rendition of ""Danny Boy."""
01:08:00;01:08:10;"Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling."
01:08:10;01:08:20;"From glen to glen and down the mountainside."
01:08:20;01:08:28;"The summer's gone and all the roses fallen."
01:08:28;01:08:38;"It's you, it's you must go and I must bide."
01:08:38;01:08:47;"But come ye back when summer's in the meadow."
01:08:47;01:08:56;"Or when the valley's lush and white with snow."
01:08:56;01:09:07;"I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow."
01:09:07;01:09:18;"Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so."
01:09:18;01:09:26;"But if you come and all the flowers are dying."
01:09:26;01:09:35;"And I am dead, as dead I will may be."
01:09:35;01:09:44;"You'll come and find the place where I am lying."
01:09:44;01:09:54;"And kneel and say, and obey there for me."
01:09:54;01:10:03;"And I will know, though soft ye tread above me."
01:10:03;01:10:12;"And then my grave will richer, sweeter be."
01:10:12;01:10:23;"And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me."
01:10:23;01:10:35;"And I will rest in peace until you come to me."
01:11:25;01:11:39;"This proud old woman did say, I had four green fields."
01:11:39;01:11:52;"Each one was a jewel, but strangers came."
01:11:52;01:11:58;"And tried to take them from me."
01:11:58;01:12:12;"But my fine strong sons, they fought to save my jewels."
01:12:12;01:12:19;"They fought and they died."
01:12:19;01:12:29;"That was my grief, said she."
01:12:29;01:12:42;"Long time ago, said the fine old woman."
01:12:42;01:12:55;"Long time ago, this proud old woman did say."
01:12:55;01:13:09;"There was war and death, plundering and pillage."
01:13:09;01:13:22;"My children stopped by mountain, valley and stream."
01:13:22;01:13:36;"And their wailing cried, they reached the very heavens."
01:13:36;01:13:54;"And my four green fields ran red with their blood, said she."
01:13:54;01:14:07;"What have I now, said the fine old woman."
01:14:07;01:14:20;"What have I now, this proud old woman did say."
01:14:20;01:14:28;"I have four green fields."
01:14:28;01:14:42;"One of them's in bondage in strangers' hands."
01:14:42;01:14:48;"That tried to take it from me."
01:14:48;01:15:02;"But my sons have sons as brave as were their fathers."
01:15:02;01:15:17;"And my four green fields will bloom once again, said she."
01:15:17;01:15:35;"And my four green fields will bloom once again, said she."
01:15:35;01:15:36;"Thank you."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"[APPLAUSE]"

01:28:17;01:28:19;"That was Chuck Berry with Run Rudolph Run."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"We're going to keep making phone calls"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"to members of the Time Crisis family."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"One of our newest additions,"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"who came on the last episode of Time Crisis,"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"was Alana Babyheim."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Alana, are you there?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"I'm part of the Time Crisis family?"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Yeah, now you are."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I am so honored."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"The episode that you were on"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"two weeks ago was a big hit."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Was it?"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I don't know. I mean, people liked it."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"I feel like I had major word vomit."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"I had a lot of fun, though."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"No, no, no. Never censor yourself."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Alana, I know that you, like myself,"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"are a Hebrew,"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"but that doesn't mean we don't love Christmas."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"What does Christmas mean to you"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"as a non-Christian?"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I actually celebrated Christmas."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"I mean, growing up,"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"I feel like"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"the Hanukkah song really explains it."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"It kind of feels a little weird"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"for a Jew on Christmas."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"It's a little weird."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"When the Hanukkah song came out, it gave us life."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"But I never really got"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"to have the whole"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Christmas tree,"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"presents, cookies,"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Santa. I never really got to do it"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"until"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"last year."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"Only last year?"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"What changed?"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"My friend was like..."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"I don't know. Maybe people just don't invite me"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"to their parties."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"I wasn't invited to a full-blown"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"Christmas party"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"until last year. I guess I've been on tour"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"for a while. I guess that'll be the excuse"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"that I'm going to use for myself."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"But"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"I went to a Christmas party, and let me tell you,"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"it was"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"the f***ing best thing I've ever"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"been a part of. It was just such a happy time."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I bet it smelled real good, right?"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"It smelled good."
01:30:05;01:30:07;"It smelled like pine"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"and gingerbread cookies."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Everyone was"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"happy. There was"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"crazy amounts of food."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"We did this thing called..."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Is it called the White Elephant?"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"Does that ring a bell?"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Oh, it's like a gift-giving game?"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Yeah, a gift-giving game where you give"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"bad gifts."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Funny gifts. Ones that make you"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"""LOL."""
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Someone got a Christmas"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"sweater that said something stupid on it."

01:30:37;01:30:39;"some tongs."
01:30:39;01:30:41;"If you're"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"making something in the kitchen, you have"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"tongs. I don't know. It was weird."
01:30:45;01:30:47;"That's a very thoughtful, useful gift, actually. Nothing funny about that."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"It is a very useful gift."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"It was just such a merry"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"party. I hope I'm invited"

01:32:01;01:32:03;"festival of lights."
01:32:03;01:32:09;"Instead of one day of presents,"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"we have eight crazy nights."
01:32:11;01:32:17;"When you feel like the only"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"kid in town without"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"a Christmas tree,"
01:32:21;01:32:25;"here's a list of people who are Jewish."
01:32:25;01:32:29;"Just like you and me."

01:33:01;01:33:03;"half too."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Put them together."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"What a fine looking Jew."
01:33:07;01:33:13;"You don't need"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"deck the halls or jingle"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"bell rock."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"'Cause you can spin a dreidel"

01:33:39;01:33:45;"But guess who is?"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Hall of Famer Rod Carew."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"He converted."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"We got"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Anne Landers and her sister"

01:34:05;01:34:07;"Ebenezer Scrooge is."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Well he's not. But guess"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"who is? All three"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"stooges."

01:34:51;01:34:55;"That was Alana Himes' Christmas"

01:34:57;01:34:59;"Choosing the Hanukkah song by Adam Sandler."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"Do you remember that song Jake? Oh yeah."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"That was a big one. Yeah, classic. On the radio."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Um,"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I met Adam Sandler at a Christmas party for the first"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"time out here in Hollywood."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Wow. Just this past week."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"What was he like? Um,"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"I don't, obviously I respect"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Mr. Sandler's work a lot."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Or the work that I'm familiar with."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"Um, so I don't wanna blow up"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"his spot too much by talking anything about him"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"personally. But,"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"one thing people have always told me about Adam Sandler"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"is that he famously"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"never dresses"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"up and that on set he's always"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"just t-shirt and sweatpants,"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"really hates fashion,"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"really doesn't care."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"And I was like, okay, I guess that just means he's"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"kind of a casual guy on set."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"So then I get to this Christmas party"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"at a beautiful home"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"in the Pacific Palisades"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"and really it was like a"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"you know, it was like a storybook"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"like"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"kind of fancy Christmas."
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Yeah. A lot of, you know,"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"middle-aged men in cashmere"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"half zips, blazers,"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"women,"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"um, dressed in"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"real like elegant dresses."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"A fancy Hollywood Christmas party."
01:36:13;01:36:15;"Honey ham. Absolutely. Honey ham on deck."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Multiple hams."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"A big beautiful Christmas tree"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"and a fire."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"And so"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"I'm at the Christmas party just looking around"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"beautiful, you know like the banister"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"has like the, you know,"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"the halls are decked. Can you disclose"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"whose house this was? No, no, I don't wanna say. Okay."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"I don't wanna say. Top secret."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Um, because they didn't invite me directly anyway."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"I gotcha. I was a plus one. Okay."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"And so everybody's dressed up real nice."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"I was wearing like a teddy bear sweater"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"in a blazer and even then I felt like, oh,"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"maybe I should have tried a little harder."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"And then I'm talking to somebody and I just hear"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"a head stick around a corner and go,"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"""Yeah!"""
01:36:53;01:36:55;"And the host of the party looks over and is like,"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"""Oh, Adam!"" And walks over to say hi"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"to him and I see them talking."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"And Adam Sandler truly"
01:37:01;01:37:05;"was so far below"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"the like dress code of the party."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"It was incredible."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"Sweatpants,"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"really old t-shirt,"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"and kind of like one of those"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"like, uh,"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"I don't know, it's like one of those kind of jackets that you might buy at a truck stop."
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Like a windbreaker?"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"No, not a windbreaker. It's like, um,"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"it's like plaid on the outside"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"and then the inside is like white, fake"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"shearling. Uh-huh."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"You know what I mean? Yep. Just like a real truck stop"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"jacket. It's like huge."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"I mean, he looked great."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"But, uh... How were those sweats?"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Were they like beat up, like gnarly gym sweats?"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"Or were they like new designer sweats?"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"They weren't new designer sweats. They were somewhere in between."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"I'm not trying to give the impression that he was like"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"dirty. It's like his clothes looked clean."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"It was just truly..."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"And also just so incredibly comfortable, too."
01:37:51;01:37:55;"That's awesome. He was there with his lovely wife"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"who was more dressed up."
01:37:57;01:37:59;"But just truly, the only person"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"at this like big Hollywood party who"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"was fully comfortable"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"just kind of wearing whatever."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"And, um,"
01:38:07;01:38:09;"I gotta say, the only way I felt about it"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"was just purely impressed. Yeah."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"Like, you could tell, like, you know when somebody's"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"comfortable, they make everybody"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"else feel comfortable, too. Yeah."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"That's awesome. Yeah, so anybody"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"who worried that Adam Sandler"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"with his"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"incredible wealth and success"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"maybe is now"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"walking around in Givenchy"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"or designer sweatpants..."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"I've worried about that."
01:38:33;01:38:35;"I assure you"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"that, uh, he's the"
01:38:37;01:38:39;"same old lovable goofball. Not"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"putting on airs whatsoever."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Let's get back to some Christmas music. Absolutely."
01:38:43;01:38:45;"Here's Sharon Jones and the"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Dab Kings with ""Ain't No Chimneys in the Projects."""
01:40:59;01:41:03;"You're listening to Time Crisis Christmas Edition."
01:41:03;01:41:07;"Jake and I are sitting. Sipping some eggnog. Sipping some eggnog."
01:41:07;01:41:11;"You know, this is a very casual show, obviously. This is a Christmas edition."
01:41:11;01:41:16;"So we're not going to do our typical top five, but we're just going to do a real casual"
01:41:16;01:41:21;"listen through the top five most downloaded Christmas songs of the digital era."
01:41:26;01:41:31;"So going back to, guess what year?"
01:41:31;01:41:36;"I think they started tracking it in 2013."
01:41:36;01:41:41;"Oh really? That recent? Yeah, that's when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital downloads as well as"
01:41:41;01:41:46;"point of sale scans. So Nielsen was on the ball. I guess."
01:41:46;01:41:51;"Let's listen through the top five most downloaded Christmas songs."
01:41:51;01:41:56;"Number five is Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree by Brenda Lee."
01:41:59;01:42:04;"Sounds like it's from the 80s."
01:42:04;01:42:09;"Oh, this song. I know this song. Yeah. This is kind of a rinky-dink version, huh?"
01:42:09;01:42:14;"Brenda Lee, I thought, was sort of like a 60s country star."
01:42:14;01:42:19;"20 years later, you get some cash. Yeah, those drums are definitely 80s."
01:42:19;01:42:23;"Oh, I hate it. I mean, I love the song, but I hate that recording. Sorry, Brenda."
01:42:23;01:42:27;"I wonder why that version was so downloaded. I don't know."
01:42:27;01:42:32;"And not some classy, you know, 60s Phil Spector version. People just don't care."
01:42:32;01:42:37;"Coming in at number four is the Trans-Siberian Orchestra with Christmas Canon."
01:42:37;01:42:42;"I've always been fascinated by Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It's some sort of like seasonal, touring,"
01:42:42;01:42:47;"stage, epic. They go around and play arenas."
01:42:49;01:42:50;"I hate this."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"Hold on. Give it a chance."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"Okay. Now do you like it? Going on yet?"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"I'm back in."
01:43:19;01:43:22;"Oh, Christmas Canon. It's Pachelbel's Canon."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Yeah. Okay."
01:43:24;01:43:28;"I don't associate Pachelbel's Canon as a Christmas song."
01:43:42;01:43:45;"Remember the graduation song by Vitamin C?"
01:43:45;01:43:49;"Vaguely. I was thinking more Oasis."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"Oh, right, right. This is one of the most famous chord progressions of all time."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Yeah, classic."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"Yeah, almost."
01:44:08;01:44:12;"It's a little bit of a different turnaround at the end."
01:44:12;01:44:17;"Yeah, people have said that the Vampire Weekend song ""Step"" is the same chord progression as Pachelbel's ""Canon,"""
01:44:17;01:44:20;"but it's not exactly. It's close."
01:44:20;01:44:24;"Try it."
01:44:24;01:44:28;"[singing]"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"That was a bad key for me."
01:44:30;01:44:42;"[singing]"
01:44:42;01:44:45;"Okay, you get the idea. Christmas Canon by Trans-Siberian Orchestra."
01:44:45;01:44:49;"I think Pachelbel's Canon is just this classic, beautiful piece of music."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"So you can make it a little Christmassy, make it a little graduation-y if you want to."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"It's a very versatile chord progression."
01:44:55;01:44:59;"Sort of like your theory about Irish music being Christmassy."
01:44:59;01:45:05;"Right, exactly. I think that's also just how we're conditioned with our Eurocentric Christmas attitude in this country."
01:45:05;01:45:06;"Right."
01:45:06;01:45:11;"I mean, one thing that's interesting to me is you know where Christmas comes from?"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"The desert."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Right."
01:45:13;01:45:18;"I just want to point something out to everybody who's listening at home."
01:45:18;01:45:27;"In America, we have this kind of crazy notion that Christmas is about fir trees and winter."
01:45:27;01:45:34;"Have you ever heard of the--this is my kind of Andy Rooney moment--you hear the derisive way that people from the Northeast"
01:45:34;01:45:41;"talk about Christmas in Arizona or Florida or, you know, Southern California."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"It's something funny about it, right?"
01:45:43;01:45:46;"People have a good old laugh about Christmas in the desert."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"Well, guess what?"
01:45:47;01:45:48;"It's just not Christmassy."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Yeah, it's not--oh, it's not Christmas."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Oh, really?"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"It's so weird to be out in LA or Scottsdale for Christmas."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"What do you do?"
01:45:56;01:46:00;"Have a cactus tree for--a cactus Christmas tree?"
01:46:00;01:46:03;"Well, guess what, buddy?"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Christmas comes from the desert."
01:46:05;01:46:08;"Jesus was born in a town called Bethlehem."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Where's Bethlehem?"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Is Bethlehem in Germany?"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Is Bethlehem in the Black Forest?"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Nope."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Is it in the Midlands of England?"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"Is it in northern New Hampshire?"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"Definitely not."
01:46:21;01:46:26;"But look, whatever you want to say--look, it's not burning up over there in December,"
01:46:26;01:46:30;"but it's definitely not--it's very rare to get snow in Bethlehem."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"It's not a white Christmas."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"It's not a white Christmas."
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Not a white Christmas in Bethlehem."
01:46:35;01:46:38;"All right, so the number three most downloaded song of the digital era"
01:46:38;01:46:44;"is ""Christmas Eve/Sarajevo,"" also by Trans-Siberian Orchestra."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Let's see what this is all about."
01:46:46;01:46:50;"Trans-Siberian Orchestra has a slight metal edge."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Yeah."
01:46:52;01:47:03;"Yeah, that's super Metallica, that chorus-y guitar tone."
01:47:06;01:47:20;"Oh!"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"This is dark."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"This sounds like the--"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Number three!"
01:47:26;01:47:29;"Hey, Grandma, we're going to throw on some Christmas music."
01:47:29;01:47:33;"This is like WWE walk-on music."
01:47:33;01:47:36;"It's like The Undertaker is about to come out."
01:47:36;01:47:42;"Like, yeah, alone in your bedroom on Christmas."
01:47:42;01:47:46;"Oh, right, right, I have heard this, yeah."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"[singing]"
01:47:48;01:47:53;"No, Grandma!"
01:47:53;01:47:57;"WWE Christmas Eve."
01:47:59;01:48:05;"Oh, that false harmonic on the guitar."
01:48:05;01:48:09;"Oh, boy. Yeah, that's super WWE."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"That is tasteless."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"He's picking up the Christmas tree!"
01:48:13;01:48:15;"Oh, I can't believe it!"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Oh, God."
01:48:18;01:48:21;"Whatever, it was kind of cool."
01:48:21;01:48:25;"The number two most downloaded Christmas song of the digital era"
01:48:25;01:48:29;"is a little bit lighter than Christmas Eve/Sarajevo."
01:48:29;01:48:31;"What's the Sarajevo reference?"
01:48:31;01:48:35;"Are they referencing, like, the war in the '90s?"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"Is this, like, the piece called that?"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Oh, the original piece?"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Yeah."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"No, that's--"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"I don't even know."
01:48:45;01:48:49;"The number two most downloaded song, a bit lighter,"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"Alvin and the Chipmunks."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"The Chipmunks song, Christmas Don't Be Late."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"Christmas Don't Be Late. I think this is their first song."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"The whole--"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"Is this from the '60s?"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"From the '60s."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"Okay, Simon."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Okay, Theodore."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Okay."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"Okay, Alvin."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Alvin."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"Alvin!"

01:49:45;01:49:48;"This is not the Chipmunks' first single."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Their first number one hit was ""Witch Doctor,"""
01:49:50;01:49:52;"but this is actually from 1958."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Oh, wow."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"And a little background--"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Multiple number one hits."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"I think you'll appreciate this."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"A little background on the Chipmunks,"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"a very California band."
01:50:02;01:50:06;"Obviously, those are the pitched-up voices of a grown man."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"I remember seeing this guy's name a lot as a kid"
01:50:08;01:50:12;"when I would watch the Chipmunks show on TV."
01:50:12;01:50:16;"So he had the stage name David Seville,"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"but his name was actually Rostam Bagdasarian."
01:50:19;01:50:22;"Not quite the same spelling as our friend Rostam"
01:50:22;01:50:25;"from Vampire Weekend, but--"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"with two O's."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"But he was born--"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"his last name is Bagdasarian."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"He was born in Fresno, California,"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"the youngest child of Dick in Virginia,"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"He enlisted in the United States Army"
01:50:38;01:50:41;"one month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"and served until the end of World War II."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"Flash forward about 10 years and kind of bouncing around"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"and showbiz comes up with this good idea"
01:50:48;01:50:51;"for a novelty record to pitch these voices up."
01:50:51;01:50:55;"I mean, that's that real kind of like--"
01:50:55;01:50:58;"you know what, the first thing I thought of was--"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"what was the movie about?"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"- Master? - The Master."
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Yeah, you know what I mean?"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"Just like this whole generation of people"
01:51:06;01:51:09;"went and served in World War II,"
01:51:09;01:51:12;"come back to civilian life--"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"just do like the weirdest stuff"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"and just like make their fortunes."

01:51:18;01:51:22;"Yeah, the most like frivolous, disposable entertainment."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"Wow."
01:51:23;01:51:27;"Anyway, shout-out to Ross, Ross the Bagdissarian."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"What do you think the number one most downloaded"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"Christmas song of the digital era is?"
01:51:32;01:51:35;"- John Lennon. - What, ""Merry Christmas War Is Over""?"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"- Yeah. - You're a dreamer, Jake."
01:51:37;01:51:39;"That's why we love having you on the show."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"You're really telling me that--"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"But I'm not the only one."

01:51:47;01:51:49;"Yeah, that's my pick."
01:51:49;01:51:51;"Yeah, you really think that's the number one--"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"you think that's what people want to hear?"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"They're with their families."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"They want to think about war being over."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"That's an uplifting message."
01:51:58;01:52:02;"Do you know how many people make their living off of war?"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"- What about them? - Arms dealers, for instance."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"Yeah, no, that's true."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"Jake, the lack of sympathy you have"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"for the military-industrial complex"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"is bizarre, to say the least."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"So anyway, no, it's not that hippie song"
01:52:17;01:52:18;"about war being over."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"The number one most downloaded Christmas song"

01:56:22;01:56:23;"Absolutely."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"Thanks to Rashida Jones, Alana Haim,"

01:56:39;01:56:41;"You know, I was talking to Jake while we were listening to that music."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Jake made a pretty compelling argument"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"for the downside of the military-industrial complex."
01:56:45;01:56:48;"I was just purely thinking in terms of job creation and GDP,"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"but I think Jake has a good point."
01:56:50;01:56:53;"One of the main ideas of this man, Jesus,"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"was about peace on Earth."

01:56:55;01:56:56;"Mm-hmm, absolutely."
01:56:56;01:56:59;"So I think John Lennon's interpretation about war being over"
01:56:59;01:57:02;"as a message of Christmas is fairly accurate"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"from what I understand about the teachings of Jesus."
01:57:05;01:57:07;"So we're gonna leave you one last song."
