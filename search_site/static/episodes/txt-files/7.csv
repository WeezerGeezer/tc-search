00:03;00:06;"Time Crisis Episode 7."
00:06;00:10;"Finally a godly number after last week's devilish number."
00:10;00:14;"Today I'm joined in the studio by painter Jake Longstreth"
00:14;00:18;"and friend of the show, actress/writer Rashida Jones."
00:18;00:22;"We'll be hearing new music from my friend Lush Life"
00:22;00:26;"as well as counting down the hits of 1979 and 2015."
00:26;00:30;"Plus, we'll be digging into one of the greatest albums of all time,"
00:30;00:32;"Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk."""
00:32;00:36;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Kainey."
00:52;00:57;"Everything seems so easy"
00:57;01:01;"And so I dealt with the blow"
01:01;01:04;"One of us had to go"
01:04;01:06;"Now it's different"
01:06;01:08;"I want you to know"
01:08;01:11;"One of us is crying"
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying"
01:14;01:19;"We were only there"
01:19;01:24;"Staring at the ceiling"
01:24;01:31;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead"
01:31;01:34;"One of us is lonely"
01:37;01:42;"Waiting for a call"
01:42;01:47;"Sorry for our selfishness"
01:48;01:51;"[playing in bright rhythm]"
01:51;02:04;"Shakedown 1979"
02:04;02:12;"Cool kids never have a time"
02:14;02:19;"Like what right above this dream"
02:19;02:23;"Would I should be"
02:23;02:30;"Two buckets dripping like a stone"
02:30;02:38;"Headlights pointed at the dawn"
02:41;02:46;"We were sure we'd never see an end to it all"
02:46;02:53;"I don't even care"
02:53;02:57;"To shake this in my head"
02:57;03:01;"And we don't even doubt now"
03:01;03:06;"'Cause we're out of both our heads to dust"
03:06;03:14;"I guess I'm guiding the sun to the moon"
03:14;03:31;"Jump across the vacant and the worn"
03:34;03:39;"Then a chill just might be heaven's stone"
03:39;03:46;"The more I think the city's slipping to us"
03:46;03:48;"Down to sea"
03:48;03:54;"And we don't even care"
03:54;03:57;"'Cause restless as we are"
03:57;04:01;"We feel without hope"
04:01;04:05;"In the land of a thousand years"
04:05;04:09;"Of boredom, silence"
04:09;04:12;"Lamented as a child"
04:12;04:18;"To the lights and towns below"
04:18;04:22;"Fast and bound"
04:22;04:26;"To sleep and sound"
04:26;04:30;"Fast and bound"
04:30;04:33;"Beguiled"
04:33;04:39;"In the sound of love"
04:39;04:46;"Justine never knew the rules"
04:46;04:54;"Hunt down with the freaks and fools"
04:56;05:01;"No apologies ever need be made"
05:01;05:11;"Are you better than you've begun to see?"
05:11;05:17;"And we don't even care"
05:17;05:21;"To shake this in our blues"
05:21;05:25;"And we don't even doubt now"
05:25;05:30;"'Cause we're out of both our heads to dust"
05:30;05:39;"I guess I'm guiding the sun to the moon"
05:39;05:47;"The street heats the urgency of now"
05:50;05:55;"As you see the snow rolling around"
05:56;05:59;"(jazz music)"
05:59;06:03;"That was ""The Smashing Pumpkins"" with 1979."
06:03;06:05;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis,"" episode 7."
06:05;06:09;"This episode, we're gonna be talking a lot about 1979"
06:09;06:12;"because it's the 36th anniversary of 1979."
06:12;06:15;"I'm joined in the studio today by Jake Longstreth."
06:15;06:16;"What's up?"
06:16;06:17;"And Rashida Jones."
06:17;06:18;"Hey."
06:18;06:21;"Rashida, we're very glad to finally have you in person"
06:21;06:22;"at the ""Time Crisis"" studio."
06:22;06:25;"You've been on the show previously,"
06:25;06:26;"but in pre-recorded segments"
06:26;06:28;"where you're telling music stories"
06:28;06:31;"about Robin Thicke and Bubbles."
06:31;06:34;"Yeah, it's nice to be here in person."
06:34;06:36;"Yeah, we're glad to finally have you."
06:36;06:38;"This might be the smallest crew"
06:38;06:40;"we've ever had for ""Time Crisis."""
06:40;06:41;"Mm-hmm."
06:41;06:42;"It's a power trio."
06:42;06:43;"I was gonna say."
06:43;06:46;"It's a powerful but small collection of people."
06:46;06:48;"Bass, guitar, and drums."
06:48;06:49;"It's all you need."
06:49;06:50;"All you need."
06:50;06:52;"And that's all we got."
06:52;06:54;"Well, before we dive too deep into 1979,"
06:54;06:55;"we're gonna be talking about"
06:55;06:57;"Leewood Mac Tusk from that year"
06:57;06:59;"and counting down the top five Billboard hits from that year."
06:59;07:00;"Before we talk about 1979,"
07:00;07:02;"let's talk about the present day."
07:02;07:03;"How's everybody doing?"
07:03;07:04;"Great."
07:05;07:06;"Us, I'm great."
07:06;07:07;"Whoo!"
07:07;07:08;"I moved today."
07:08;07:09;"Where'd you move?"
07:09;07:12;"I moved to a new house in Highland Park."
07:12;07:13;"So you live there now?"
07:13;07:14;"Yeah."
07:14;07:15;"First night in tonight?"
07:15;07:17;"Yeah, first night is tonight,"
07:17;07:21;"and the movers were at the old apartment at 8:30 this morning,"
07:21;07:23;"did the full load in,"
07:23;07:26;"and then four hours later,"
07:26;07:28;"everything was at the new spot."
07:28;07:31;"This is not to make you feel bad about your first night there,"
07:31;07:33;"but every time I think of a first night,"
07:33;07:34;"I think of ""Poltergeist."""
07:34;07:35;"Mm-hmm."
07:35;07:36;"You know, when they're like,"
07:36;07:38;"""Oh, finally we got out of that crazy house,"""
07:38;07:40;"and then they go to that--"
07:40;07:41;"I think that it's like--"
07:41;07:44;"Is it like a hotel, or is it a second house?"
07:44;07:47;"And then there's like worse ""Poltergeist"" there."
07:47;07:48;"But you're going to be fine."
07:48;07:50;"Wait, is that like the end of the movie?"
07:50;07:51;"Yeah."
07:51;07:54;"I was talking to a friend last night that she was telling a story"
07:54;07:57;"that she moved into her new house that she had bought,"
07:57;07:59;"and the first night at 4 in the morning,"
07:59;08:01;"neighbors rooster."
08:01;08:03;"[rooster crowing]"
08:03;08:04;"Oh, God."
08:04;08:05;"And it is like a part--"
08:05;08:07;"I actually crashed there one night,"
08:07;08:11;"and it's like an inseparable fixture to the house."
08:11;08:13;"It's like this cacophony of rooster."
08:13;08:15;"It's like a hipster chicken coop?"
08:15;08:18;"No, it's like Mexican chicken coop next door."
08:18;08:20;"What neighborhood is it?"
08:20;08:22;"Lincoln Heights."
08:22;08:27;"Well, this is the classic issue that you get with gentrification"
08:27;08:29;"is people buy houses,"
08:29;08:33;"and they expect that the neighborhood will conform to them."
08:33;08:34;"Right."
08:34;08:36;"And I'm not accusing your friend of--"
08:36;08:38;"I don't know anything about your friend."
08:38;08:40;"But then the rooster starts crowing at 4 a.m."
08:40;08:42;"Maybe those people live there forever."
08:42;08:48;"Maybe the rooster has lived there with them for a long time."
08:48;08:49;"Who knows?"
08:49;08:51;"Maybe they have chickens and they eat the eggs,"
08:51;08:53;"and that's just whatever part of how they live."
08:53;08:56;"And then suddenly you've got people calling the city and being like,"
08:56;08:58;"""Can you do something about this [bleep] rooster?"""
08:58;09:03;"Well, that person actually has not called the city about the rooster,"
09:03;09:05;"and I haven't grilled her as to why."
09:05;09:09;"I do get the sense of not wanting to stir up things in the neighborhood"
09:09;09:11;"and cause a ruckus."
09:11;09:14;"But I would say that the person that vacated the house before they moved there"
09:14;09:18;"left because they hated the rooster so much."
09:18;09:19;"Who knows?"
09:19;09:20;"Yeah, it's possible."
09:20;09:25;"We can't assume just the people that were there prior also loved the rooster."
09:25;09:29;"Anyway, that's kind of a brutal first night story."
09:29;09:32;"Why don't we get back into some music?"
09:32;09:35;"Not everything we play today is going to be from 1979."
09:35;09:37;"That would be way too limiting."
09:37;09:41;"But we're going to play stuff kind of late '70s, early '80s."
09:41;09:42;"Why not?"
09:42;09:45;"And, you know, I think one thing I've noticed about Time Crisis so far"
09:45;09:49;"is we've been leaning very heavily on the Anglosphere,"
09:49;09:51;"the English-speaking countries of the world."
09:51;09:53;"So let's try something a little bit different."
09:53;10:00;"This is ""Uma Latheni Nabo"" with a song that was first brought to many Westerners"
10:00;10:03;"on a classic compilation called ""The Indestructible Beat of Soweto."""
10:03;10:05;"Check it out."

15:41;15:44;"That was Orchestra Baobab with Bouma Amine,"
15:44;15:46;"classic band out of Senegal."
15:46;15:49;"So some of our listeners might realize"
15:49;15:53;"that I'm still here in Los Angeles."
15:53;15:56;"I'm very lucky to be in L.A. because I get to have"
15:56;15:59;"great people like Jake Longstreth and Rashida Jones on the show,"
15:59;16:03;"but originally Time Crisis was supposed to be a New York show."
16:03;16:06;"We haven't gotten to check in with Cousin Asher and Despot"
16:06;16:08;"in a long time."
16:08;16:10;"We will. It's getting a little bit ridiculous."
16:10;16:12;"But I want everybody in New York to know,"
16:12;16:15;"just because work has taken me to L.A."
16:15;16:17;"does not mean that I've given up on the city"
16:17;16:19;"and I won't be home soon."
16:19;16:21;"So with that in mind,"
16:21;16:24;"I think we should go over a little bit of New York news."
16:24;16:27;"This is New York News."
16:27;16:30;"So what's going on in New York?"
16:30;16:33;"Our producer Colin has pulled a few articles"
16:33;16:35;"to let us know what's happening in New York."
16:35;16:37;"This is one from Gothamist."
16:37;16:40;"As soon as I read the title of this article,"
16:40;16:42;"I know we have to talk about it."
16:42;16:46;"It says, ""Insufferable Millennials Now Doing Juice Crawls."""
16:46;16:51;"Okay, right off the bat, this article has a lot of attitude."
16:51;16:52;"A lot."
16:52;16:54;"I'll read you guys the beginning of this article."
16:54;16:58;"""Millennials like myself spend a lot of time defending accusations"
16:58;17:00;"that our generation is lazy, entitled,"
17:00;17:03;"and hell-bent on bringing down the working man's beer."""
17:03;17:04;"I don't know what that means."
17:04;17:07;"""But sometimes the city's young folk participate in something so foolhardy,"
17:07;17:09;"even the most staunch millennial defender"
17:09;17:12;"is forced to throw their own under the bus."
17:12;17:14;"And juice crawls, a hot new trend"
17:14;17:16;"some insane people seem to enjoy right now,"
17:16;17:19;"is one such craze worthy of Gen X burning."""
17:19;17:22;"And basically what a juice crawl is, is people,"
17:22;17:26;"adults in their 20s to 30s, who pay $15 to $50"
17:26;17:29;"to spend their evening sampling juices from various shops in Manhattan."
17:29;17:31;"Why is he so mad?"
17:31;17:35;"Why is he or she so mad about it?"
17:35;17:36;"Yeah."
17:36;17:41;"It's less--I feel like there would be less police activity"
17:41;17:45;"if there's kids crawling through juice and not through alcohol."
17:45;17:46;"That's the problem."
17:46;17:48;"Right, like alcohol can lead to more violence."
17:48;17:49;"Yeah."
17:49;17:52;"We don't know about juice yet, but I don't think so."
17:52;17:54;"Raw food buzz."
17:56;18:02;"I mean, this is one of those situations where I feel like we all hate the world."
18:02;18:06;"We're all in agreement that the world, especially America, is a horrible place."
18:06;18:08;"We are?"
18:08;18:10;"The panel agrees."
18:10;18:14;"And I think people have this deep hatred of the world"
18:14;18:17;"because it is so miserable and unfair."
18:17;18:22;"And naturally, when you have this kind of holistic view that something is horrible,"
18:22;18:27;"you want to look to find the specific reasons why."
18:27;18:32;"So here we're talking about juice crawls and saying that's the problem."
18:32;18:34;"That's where people are crossing the line."
18:34;18:38;"That's the heart of the problem, the heart of the problem of everything."
18:38;18:41;"Maybe there's an element of blaming the victims."
18:41;18:49;"Or it's blaming the--maybe to the writer it's indicative of the wealth gap."
18:49;18:52;"Who else is going to do the juice crawl besides--"
18:52;18:54;"Like wealthy, entitled people who have a lot of time?"
18:54;18:55;"Yuppies."
18:55;19:01;"I mean, basically in the '80s, people in their 30s or 20s that were making money were yuppies."
19:01;19:07;"The funny thing about this article is that the writer's stance is actually that of Sarah Palin."
19:07;19:08;"Yeah, I wonder how old the writer is."
19:08;19:13;"She's sort of like, ""Oh, real America,"" as if New York City is not real America."
19:13;19:22;"And he's kind of taking that same stance of like, ""Look at these rich New Yorkers doing this stupid juice cleanse."""
19:22;19:24;"I think it's like--it feels a little bit nostalgic."
19:24;19:29;"Like, ""Oh, what happened in the good old days when people just drank beer after work?"
19:29;19:31;"Why are they drinking juice?"""
19:31;19:37;"But you're right. It does sort of feel like an older generation criticism of a younger generation."
19:37;19:38;"I don't know."
19:38;19:39;"I mean, it's annoying."
19:39;19:41;"It's a joke, but I feel like it's just a joke, right?"
19:41;19:42;"Yeah, it's a joke."
19:42;19:44;"Not really annoying to the writer."
19:44;19:46;"It's just a reason to write."
19:46;19:48;"Everything's just a big f---ing joke."
19:48;19:49;"Juice is a joke."
19:49;19:50;"Alcohol is a joke."
19:50;19:52;"Well, excuse me if I'm not laughing."

49:15;49:17;"Wait, is that the same thing? -Yeah."
49:17;49:19;"-Is preschool nursery school? -They're similar."
49:19;49:21;"I was at the Sunshine Preschool."
49:21;49:23;"[ Both laugh ]"
49:23;49:26;"I was loving life. I don't know what to say."
49:26;49:27;"I was living the dream."
49:27;49:29;"-Did you still live with your parents then?"
49:29;49:31;"-Yes. I moved out when I was four."
49:31;49:34;"-Yeah. That was your last year."
49:34;49:36;"-That was my last year at home."
49:36;49:38;"And then I started making a living at four."
49:38;49:40;"-Do you have any real memories from 1979?"
49:40;49:44;"-Um, I do, but I feel like whatever memories I have"
49:44;49:49;"are just like a composite of like 1978 to like 1982."
49:49;49:52;"-So your father is the world-famous music producer"
49:52;49:55;"Quincy Jones, and one of his most famous productions"
49:55;49:57;"is ""Michael Jackson Off the Wall."""
49:57;49:58;"Is that from 1979?"
49:58;50:00;"-It was released in '79. Yeah."
50:00;50:02;"So I don't -- I mean, I wasn't old enough"
50:02;50:05;"to know what was going on yet."
50:05;50:08;"But that's a really good album."
50:08;50:10;"And it's still one of my favorites."
50:10;50:12;"-It's a solid album. Everybody should go check it out."
50:12;50:15;"-Yeah. So you don't have memories of like that coming out?"
50:15;50:17;"Do you remember when ""Thriller"" came out?"
50:17;50:18;"-Yes. Very well. Yes."
50:18;50:21;"And I was there when they were making a lot of those songs, too."
50:21;50:24;"'Cause I, you know, I was old enough to be hanging around."
50:24;50:28;"But yeah, I actually went to the set of when they were making"
50:28;50:30;"the ""Thriller"" video. -Yeah."
50:30;50:32;"-It was in Griffith Park."
50:32;50:35;"And I was -- I guess it must have been like '80."
50:35;50:37;"Did that come out '84? -Sounds right."
50:37;50:39;"-'83? Maybe '83."
50:39;50:41;"This is terrible. I'm sorry."
50:41;50:44;"But yeah, I remember we went and visited set,"
50:44;50:48;"and we were looking through the storyboards of the video shoot."
50:48;50:52;"And right as we got to the part when, like, he jumps out,"
50:52;50:56;"you know, and he's got the teeth, and he's turning into a werewolf,"
50:56;51:00;"Michael walked into the trailer with those, like, crazy green contacts,"
51:00;51:02;"and my sister and I lost our minds."
51:02;51:04;"-He frightened you? -He frightened me."
51:04;51:07;"-That sounds pretty scary. Jake, what were you doing in 1979?"
51:07;51:09;"-I was 2, I guess."
51:09;51:12;"-Where were you living those days? -Southbury, Connecticut."
51:12;51:14;"-Do you have any memories? -No."
51:14;51:20;"In a drafty, old colonial farmhouse that my parents had bought in '77."
51:20;51:27;"My dad was working as a regional bank manager for People's Bank,"
51:27;51:30;"which was a Connecticut-only bank, you know, back in the day"
51:30;51:32;"when there used to be small regional banks."
51:32;51:36;"-Right. -His starting salary in '77 was $10,000 a year."
51:36;51:38;"-Wow. -Wow."
51:38;51:42;"-Was that good money back then? -I don't think so."
51:42;51:47;"I mean, I think it was, you know, $35,000 in today's dollars, I'm guessing."
51:47;51:49;"-Okay, so that's-- -It's okay. Yeah, it's decent."
51:49;51:52;"-That's less than the starting salary of a New York City teacher."
51:52;51:54;"-Okay. I just pulled that figure out, though."
51:54;51:56;"-We'll fact-check that later. -Yeah, yeah."
51:56;51:59;"-Okay, so 1979, let's get started."
51:59;52:04;"-It's time for the Top 5."
52:04;52:07;"-The No. 5 song on the Billboard charts this week in 1979"
52:07;52:09;"was by Earth, Wind & Fire."

52:15;52:17;"-I love it. It's great."
52:17;52:19;"-I'm guessing this is a ballad. -It's a ballad, yeah."

54:24;54:26;"-Yes. -And then they kind of mellowed out?"
54:26;54:28;"-There was, like, a lot of disco."

55:31;55:35;"I mean, some people would say that ""Silento"" maybe, like,"
55:35;55:38;"that song sounds a little harder than after the love is gone,"
55:38;55:39;"but, you know, who knows?"

55:49;55:50;"I don't think ""After the Love is Gone"""
55:50;55:53;"has a dance attached to it."

55:55;55:56;"-No. -Far from it."
55:56;55:57;"-Hard to even compare those."
55:57;55:59;"-It is hard. -I mean, ""The Earth, Wind, and Fire"""

56:04;56:08;"-Right. Just, like, hard to sing that stuff."

56:11;56:12;"-Silento. -Silento."
56:12;56:14;"-It's, like, a vibe song. -Yeah, it's sort of like,"
56:14;56:16;"get this beat going. -Well, yeah, it's a dance song."
56:16;56:18;"I mean, but the truth is, there's the equivalence"
56:18;56:21;"in the '50s and '60s of dance songs that may be --"
56:21;56:22;"-Absolutely. -That would maybe"
56:22;56:24;"uncharitably be called novelty songs,"
56:24;56:26;"but they're just great songs that have a dance"
56:26;56:27;"that goes with them, and they talk about the dance"
56:27;56:29;"in the song. -And ""Earth, Wind, and Fire"""
56:29;56:31;"probably has songs like that. It's just not that one."
56:31;56:32;"-Yeah. [ Both laugh ]"
56:32;56:35;"But two great songs, I would say, so far, to draw."
56:35;56:36;"-I agree. I like them both very much."

58:50;58:53;"before he, you know, finalized the mix."
58:53;58:55;"He'd play them on, like, tiny little speakers."
58:55;58:58;"Because he knew that most people would be listening"

59:01;59:04;"like, professional, like, you know, speakers."
59:04;59:06;"So he wanted it to work at that level."
59:06;59:08;"-Like on a little transistor radio?"

59:12;59:13;"you know. -Did your dad's car,"
59:13;59:16;"you think, have a cassette deck in 1979?"

59:23;59:25;"-Okay. Interesting. -He doesn't drive."
59:25;59:27;"-So your dad's never driven once in his life?"
59:27;59:28;"-No. -Wow."
59:28;59:29;"-Yeah, wow. -So everybody,"
59:29;59:31;"you should keep in mind that song was produced by a man"

01:12:58;01:13:00;"-Well, yeah. -And I think, dynamically,"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"they step it up and down."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"-Do you think there's -- -But harmonically,"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"it's just sort of like the same chords."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"-No, I think that's what always happens with musical styles."
01:13:07;01:13:10;"Like, there's a reaction to kind of this, like,"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"baroque stuff with lots of little details and stuff."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"And then, eventually, that stuff starts to sound soggy,"

01:13:22;01:13:24;"about the Bieber song. -Yeah."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"-It sounds very fresh."
01:13:25;01:13:28;"-Was there a moment -- Was there, like, a turning point?"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"I feel like everybody sort of embraced dance music."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"-They did? -Well, no."

01:14:09;01:14:10;"a bit of danciness."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Like, you're supposed to be able to dance to most pop music."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"But I think, also, a lot of pop people looked around"
01:14:15;01:14:18;"the same way that, like, when rock was, like, weirdly big,"

01:16:54;01:16:55;"Yeah."

01:17:06;01:17:10;"That, and everybody knows that Rosanna is Rosanna Arquette. Toto."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"Oh."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"I didn't know that."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"I've never met anybody with the name Cirona."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Yeah, right. I have."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Was she a real estate agent?"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"Yes."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"What was her, do you know what her last name is?"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"I don't."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Hold on, I want to find out."
01:17:23;01:17:30;"But I was like, it's so funny because I saw her and I was just imagining what her life was like in like 1978."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"Right."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"You know? I feel like she--"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"How old do you think she was? She's probably like 16, 18."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Yeah."
01:17:35;01:17:39;"Hanging out in this like kinda new wave punk rock LA scene."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Yeah."
01:17:40;01:17:51;"So Cirona's last name is Alperin. Cirona Alperin. And she specializes in West LA real estate. And guess what her website is? www.myscirona.com."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"Is there a DOB on that?"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"Let's find out."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Or Cirona Alperin."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"About Cirona."
01:17:58;01:18:01;"Just keeping that information closely guarded."
01:18:01;01:18:09;"Okay, no. Cirona was only 17 when she was immortalized in the 1979 hit single My Cirona. So that means she was born in 1962."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Same year as Obama."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Oh yeah, same year as Target."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Target."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"Oh my god."
01:18:14;01:18:15;"She was born the same year as Target."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"And Taco Bell."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"And Taco Bell. And what was the other one?"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"Walmart."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"Wow."
01:18:20;01:18:21;"Huge year."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"Oh god."
01:18:23;01:18:31;"So that song, yeah, I mean, it's not the greatest. It was sort of a novelty song for the NEC, because they were sort of like power pop band."
01:18:31;01:18:40;"Like punk rock, power pop, new wave, whatever. Just whatever was happening at that time. And that was their like, I kinda think, deliberately bad novelty song."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"Just trying to be a little silly."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Yeah."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"That's the only rock song that was on the top five in 1979."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Wow."
01:18:46;01:18:51;"So maybe all this talk of rock's dead, maybe rock died a long time ago. Although it is number one."
01:18:51;01:18:57;"Let's see how My Cirona stacks up to this week's number one. The Weekend with The Hills."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"Wow, this song is huge. Huge."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"This is like, I feel like this is the theme song of Time Crisis."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Yeah, kind of."
01:19:05;01:19:13;"Oh my god. Doing this show is really becoming like this surreal hellscape nightmare."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Not because the songs are bad."
01:19:15;01:19:24;"But just because I hear them over and over again. And also for the listeners at home, I'm going to talk over The Weekend. I hope he doesn't mind. We've listened to it so many times."
01:19:24;01:19:38;"You also have to imagine that we're all here in a windowless room, somewhere in the bowels of Hollywood, listening to these songs over and over again. Everybody's a little slap happy. We're going mental."
01:19:38;01:19:42;"Can you sing it? Because it's nice when you sing it."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"I love it whenever she sings it."
01:19:43;01:19:54;"[Singing]"
01:19:54;01:20:03;"Let me try to sing this for real. The truth is, I haven't sang very much in the past year. A lot of people forget that I'm a professional musician."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"What?"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Nobody forgets that."
01:20:06;01:20:12;"They all forgot that I was a professional musician. I've been doing such a good job hosting this radio show."
01:20:12;01:20:17;"Did you know that renowned radio host, Ezra Keenan, used to have a band?"
01:20:17;01:20:25;"But the truth is, I haven't sang that much. I've been starting to sing more. I'm not going to say why, but I've been trying to sing a little more."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Why so secretive?"
01:20:26;01:20:32;"Picking up a mic. Because I'm an artist, Jake. I'm a professional musical artist."
01:20:32;01:20:37;"So in your attempt to maintain a sense of mystery about yourself, you decided to do a radio show."
01:20:37;01:20:44;"That's right. You came on to run interference for me."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"You also can hide behind a persona."
01:20:46;01:20:52;"I can hide behind a persona. Everything that you hear coming out of my mouth that you don't like is, of course, a persona."
01:20:52;01:20:59;"Anyway, I haven't sang in a long time. And as I'm starting to sing more again, you realize it's not easy."
01:20:59;01:21:07;"Perhaps my voice is growing richer with age. I don't know. But anyway, I thought maybe I would try to really sing this song."
01:21:07;01:21:13;"It's a difficult song. I don't have the same kind of range as Abel."
01:21:13;01:21:18;"And I know a lot of times when I sing it, I sing it in kind of a jokey way. Let me try to sing it for real."
01:21:18;01:21:33;"I only you when it's past five."
01:21:33;01:21:38;"I only you see, I don't know where to break. I don't know where to go into falsetto."
01:21:38;01:21:42;"He has a crazy voice. I don't have a voice like the weekend."
01:21:42;01:21:48;"I, you know, I can do. Thank you. Thank you very much. But let me try it again."
01:21:48;01:21:54;"You win. It's half past five."
01:21:54;01:21:58;"What's the next line? Isn't it call? I only call you."
01:21:58;01:22:01;"I really want to get it right, because who knows how many times we'll get to listen to this."
01:22:01;01:22:05;"This will be a special five hour edition of Time Crisis."
01:22:05;01:22:13;"I only you when it's half past five. The only time that I'll be by your side."
01:22:13;01:22:17;"I only love it when you've touched me. Not feel me when I'm up."
01:22:17;01:22:22;"That's the real me when I'm up. That's the real me. Yeah, that was great."
01:22:22;01:22:26;"I got to work on it. Thank you. Thank you. Listen, a lot of a lot of people."
01:22:26;01:22:30;"There are people who are just naturally gifted singers and they don't need to warm up."
01:22:30;01:22:34;"They don't need to ease back in. But you know what? I'm putting it all out there"
01:22:34;01:22:39;"because I'm trying to maintain my professional musician status."
01:22:39;01:22:45;"So I got to keep singing. You know what? One of my favorite Protestant hymns is."
01:22:45;01:22:49;"What is going on, dad?"
01:22:49;01:22:53;"It's a song that I believe was written in the 18th century in England,"
01:22:53;01:22:59;"but it still find its way into churches and in worship music today."
01:22:59;01:23:03;"And it's called How Can I Keep From Singing? It's a beautiful song."
01:23:03;01:23:07;"Enya famously covered it. Maybe that's the version I should play."
01:23:07;01:23:10;"You could find a lot of boys choirs singing it and blah, blah, blah."
01:23:10;01:23:13;"But basically it's a very kind of mystical Christian song."
01:23:13;01:23:18;"And the lyrics are about how you kind of like feel this vibe about how incredible the world is"
01:23:18;01:23:23;"that the Lord created. And the chorus basically goes, how can I keep from singing?"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"So why don't we check that out? That's a nice palate cleanser."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"After the top five, here's Enya with How Can I Keep From Singing?"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"This one's dedicated to me, a professional singer, because I got to keep singing."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"You just dedicated a song to yourself."

01:28:04;01:28:09;"like some pretty cool musical, you know, diversity."

01:28:35;01:28:36;"I know what you mean."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"In terms of production,"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"they could all fit kind of pretty well"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"on an album together."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Yeah."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Can I just make an annoying statement"
01:28:42;01:28:46;"that there's no women in both of those Top 5s?"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Well, hold on a second."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Let me run the numbers on that."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Yeah, you might be right."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"I think I am."
01:28:52;01:28:55;"The 1979 Top 5 have no women, but there's one Jones."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"That's true."
01:28:56;01:29:03;"The 2015 Top 5 have no women and no Joneses."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"So I'm going to go for 1979."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Yeah, that's right."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"No women either."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"I feel like last week, Ezra,"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"when it was 2015 versus '85,"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"2015 kind of cleaned up."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"Yeah, it did."
01:29:14;01:29:18;"And it was like '85 was super stiff, as I remember."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Right, much stronger showing from 1979."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"Yeah, this time I'm going to lean towards '79."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Maybe I'm growing a little tired of the 2015 songs."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"And I think just the palette."
01:29:27;01:29:31;"It's like spacey, like monotonous a little bit,"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"not a ton of chord changes."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"You know, one thing you could say,"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"1979, even though the Herb Alpert song"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"was extraordinarily depressing,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"and ""Earth, Wind, and Fire After the Love is Gone"""
01:29:43;01:29:45;"is obviously kind of a sad song."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"But incredible."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"The songs like ""My Sharona,"" ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"""
01:29:50;01:29:51;"are kind of positive."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"If you look at the current top five,"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"the two weekend songs are both kind of like dark"
01:29:56;01:30:00;"and maybe have a tone of something really dark behind them."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"""What Do You Mean"" by Justin Bieber"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"is about being confused"
01:30:04;01:30:07;"and you can't tell what's going on in a relationship."
01:30:07;01:30:08;"""Hotline Bling"" by Drake"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"is also a little bit about alienation."
01:30:10;01:30:13;"The only one that's legitimately happy is ""Watch Me Whip."""
01:30:13;01:30:15;"And actually, at the end of the day, dancing is neutral."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"No, dancing's positive."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Is dancing positive?"
01:30:17;01:30:21;"You could make an argument that all those songs occur in one night,"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"that it starts with ""Watch Me Whip"" and they're having fun,"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"and then she calls, and it's like, ""Oh, it's only one thing."""
01:30:28;01:30:30;"And then the Hills, he goes over to her house,"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"and then he's like, ""Wait a second, I can't feel my face"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"'cause I'm on drugs."""
01:30:34;01:30:36;"And then he's like, ""Wait, what do you mean?"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"What are we doing here?"""
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Right."
01:30:38;01:30:41;"And then they have sex, and it's 5.30 in the morning,"
01:30:41;01:30:44;"and he's like, ""I think I'm just gonna go to Denny's"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"and go home."""
01:30:46;01:30:48;"And she's like, ""What is this, weekend?"""
01:30:48;01:30:53;"Right, and then she listens to ""Rise"" by Herb Alpert when he leaves."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"And then it's 1979."
01:30:55;01:30:58;"And that was our two top fives."
01:30:58;01:30:59;"[laughter]"
01:31:07;01:31:11;"I'm gonna take this moment to debut a song by a good friend of mine"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"by the name of Lush Life."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"I didn't know him in 1979, but I knew him very well"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"starting around 1998."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"I know him primarily as Raj, my friend Raj Haldar"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"from Glenridge, New Jersey."
01:31:22;01:31:25;"We went to high school together, a very influential figure in my life."
01:31:25;01:31:28;"Taught me a lot about music, a lot of nights driving around"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"in his Honda Accord, listening to Tribe Called Quest,"
01:31:31;01:31:34;"The Roots, who were his favorite group of all time,"
01:31:34;01:31:37;"very big into '90s hip-hop, among other things."
01:31:37;01:31:39;"A very accomplished DJ and rapper."
01:31:39;01:31:42;"And Raj sent us one of his new songs,"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"which we have the honor of debuting right now."
01:31:44;01:31:49;"So here is my good friend Lush Life with his new song ""Body Double."""
01:35:47;01:35:49;"That was Lush Life with ""Body Double,"""
01:35:49;01:35:51;"debuted here on Time Crisis."
01:35:51;01:35:55;"A song from 2015, but now we're going to get back into 1979,"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"because it's time to finally talk Tusk,"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"a Fleetwood Mac album from that year"
01:35:59;01:36:02;"that Jake is going to talk to us about"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"and lead a roundtable discussion about."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Absolutely."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Okay, so Tusk, who's it by?"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"We know it's from 1979."
01:36:09;01:36:13;"Who's it by? Is it by a band, a solo artist, a duo?"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"A band called Fleetwood Mac."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Okay."
01:36:15;01:36:20;"To talk about Tusk properly, I feel like we need to go back to 1977."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Are you sure? Not 1962?"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Let's really set the stage."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"Exactly. What was Lindsey Buckingham doing in '62?"
01:36:27;01:36:33;"1776, a brave group of patriots fighting against the Mad King George."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"Okay."
01:36:34;01:36:39;"Fleetwood Mac released the album ""Rumors"" February 4, 1977,"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"which is actually the day after I was born."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Oh, my God."
01:36:42;01:36:45;"And ""Rumors,"" as we probably all know,"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"really kind of set the--like is a classic example still today"
01:36:48;01:36:54;"of a hugely successful, commercially-oriented rock and roll pop album."
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Mm-hmm."
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Chock full of singles."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"There's like five or six singles off of ""Rumors"""
01:36:58;01:37:01;"that you're going to hear on the radio still today."
01:37:01;01:37:07;"""Dreams,"" ""You Can Go Your Own Way,"" ""You Make Loving Fun,"" ""Don't Stop."""
01:37:07;01:37:08;"Huge."
01:37:08;01:37:09;"Yeah, it's huge."
01:37:09;01:37:15;"That comes out February '77, and then Tusk comes out October of '79."
01:37:15;01:37:20;"And a lot of the talk in the media at that point was that"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"it had cost a million dollars to record,"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"which was at that--"
01:37:24;01:37:27;"And back in the '70s, a million dollars was a lot of money."
01:37:27;01:37:28;"That's right. Not like today."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Not like today. Right."
01:37:30;01:37:35;"And a million dollars to record Tusk was actually the most ever spent"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"up until that point for an album."
01:37:37;01:37:40;"Before Axl Rose destroyed it with ""Chinese Democracy."""
01:37:40;01:37:43;"Right, when he spent $45 million."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"No, I had no idea."
01:37:44;01:37:48;"The album came out. It retailed for $16."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"Wow."
01:37:49;01:37:52;"Which, I did a little math, that's $52 in today's--"
01:37:52;01:37:53;"Wait, why?"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"Isn't that crazy?"
01:37:54;01:37:55;"Is it a double album?"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"Double album."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"That's psycho."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"Yeah."
01:37:58;01:38:01;"And there was a lot of heat on this record."
01:38:01;01:38:04;"I mean, Lindsey Buckingham famously rented out Dodger Stadium"
01:38:04;01:38:08;"and recorded the USC marching band there in an empty stadium"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"because it was the right--"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"For the title track, Tusk."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Yeah, yeah."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"It comes out--"
01:38:12;01:38:18;"It's reeking of rock and roll hubris, of spinal tap level,"
01:38:18;01:38:23;"of ridiculous excess in terms of money, insane logistics"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"with Dodger Stadium, building--"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Cocaine?"
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Absolutely."
01:38:27;01:38:30;"And so people are ready for this record to come out."
01:38:30;01:38:33;"And then when it comes out, everyone's, I think, kind of confused"
01:38:33;01:38:37;"because it's a very understated, stark album that,"
01:38:37;01:38:42;"in terms of the sugary pop aesthetic that they had developed"
01:38:42;01:38:45;"so much for ""Rumors,"" they really kind of pumped the brakes on that"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"with this record."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"""Rumors"" had sold 20 million copies."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Tusk sells 2 million copies."
01:38:51;01:38:57;"So in the short run, in terms of pure commercial success, it was a flop."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"A 90% loss."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"Yeah."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"There's two singles off of Tusk, neither of which topped the charts,"
01:39:04;01:39:08;"and neither of which you're going to hear on the radio still today."
01:39:08;01:39:12;"And yet Tusk is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album."
01:39:12;01:39:14;"And I think a lot of people love Tusk."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"Maybe let's start with Tusk, the title track,"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"because this maybe is the best-known song."
01:39:19;01:39:24;"This and then a song called ""Sarah,"" which is a long Stevie Nicks song."
01:39:24;01:39:28;"Let's check out Tusk, title track from the 1979 album from Fleetwood Mac."
01:39:28;01:39:48;"# Why don't you ask him if he's gonna stay?"
01:39:48;01:39:56;"# Why don't you tell me what's going on?"
01:39:56;01:40:02;"# Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?"
01:40:02;01:40:28;"# Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?"
01:40:28;01:40:38;"# Why don't you ask him and let's talk some more?"
01:40:38;01:40:48;"# Don't say that you love me."
01:40:48;01:40:58;"# Just tell me that you love me."
01:40:58;01:41:10;"# Don't say that you love me."
01:41:10;01:41:24;"# Don't show me that you... #"
01:41:24;01:41:44;"This is real Savage Life."
01:41:44;01:41:54;"# Don't show me that you love me."
01:42:04;01:42:20;"# Don't show me that you love me."
01:42:20;01:42:24;"Fleetwood Mac with Tusk. Fascinating song."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"Probably my least favorite song on that record."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"That's the one with the marching band."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Yeah, that's the marching band one."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"To me that's sort of novelty. It's just like..."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"That's my least favorite song on the album."
01:42:35;01:42:38;"Probably ""Save Me a Place,"" Buckingham's song."
01:42:38;01:42:41;"I mean, he recorded a bunch of these songs that are sort of these like..."
01:42:41;01:42:47;"They're like the most elegantly engineered basement tapes ever."
01:42:47;01:42:52;"Let's listen to ""That's Enough for Me"" and then ""Save Me a Place."""

01:47:11;01:47:14;"Those are two tracks sung by Lindsey Buckingham."
01:47:14;01:47:19;"Um, the person who maybe was straining against expectations"
01:47:19;01:47:22;"the most in the band at the time."
01:47:22;01:47:25;"One story that I heard about the making of this album,"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"you're talking about Lindsey reacting to punk."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- Mm-hmm."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"- And I think you see this in a lot of artists' careers,"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"these older artists who see something new coming,"
01:47:33;01:47:36;"and it drives them crazy one way or another."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"They have to react to it."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"They can't--and, you know,"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"and maybe Stevie Nicks is just a more peaceful person."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"Certainly their personas would suggest"
01:47:43;01:47:46;"that Stevie Nicks is more of a peaceful person."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"She just does what she does."
01:47:47;01:47:50;"And Lindsey's more of, like, somebody who's, like,"
01:47:50;01:47:54;"maybe is, like, got his finger on the pulse a little bit more."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"And so the story that I heard is that, um,"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"Lindsey comes in the studio,"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"maybe he'd just been listening to some punk and new wave,"
01:48:00;01:48:05;"and he sees the kind of yacht rock type engineers in the studio."
01:48:05;01:48:08;"These guys with kind of, like, beards and, like, long hair,"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"probably wearing, like, Hawaiian shirts or something,"
01:48:10;01:48:11;"like, fresh off the yacht."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"And they were just like--and Lindsey comes in"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"with, like, a buzz cut."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"I'm taking a lot of creative license with this story."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"- I like this, yeah."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"- Lindsey comes in with just, like, a full shaved head"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"and a T-shirt and just sees these guys."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"And they're just like, ""Hey, Lindsey, what's up, man?"""
01:48:24;01:48:27;"And he's like, ""Man, you gotta shave that beard."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"You gotta cut that long hair"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"and ditch the Hawaiian shirts, man,"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"because you look like losers."""
01:48:32;01:48:34;"And I think that was a lot of the tension in the studio then"
01:48:34;01:48:37;"was, like, he felt like, ""Am I the only one who can see it?"""
01:48:37;01:48:38;"- Yeah."
01:48:38;01:48:39;"- Punk rock is mopping the floor with us."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"These young people are doing something cool and interesting,"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"and I'm surrounded by these Hawaiian shirt-wearing losers."
01:48:44;01:48:47;"People are laughing at us, man."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"- Absolutely."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"I mean, I think the first time--"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"- And bless his heart."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- Yeah, no, I think it's great."
01:48:51;01:48:54;"I mean, that song, ""That's Enough for Me,"""
01:48:54;01:48:57;"to me, that reminds me of, like, a Buddy Holly song,"
01:48:57;01:49:01;"which, to me, Buddy Holly is, like, proto-punk."
01:49:01;01:49:02;"- Minimalist, raw."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Urgent. - Urgent."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"- Fast. - Yeah."
01:49:04;01:49:09;"- So this morning I was reading reviews of ""Tusk,"""
01:49:09;01:49:13;"and I found one from December of '79 in ""Rolling Stone"""
01:49:13;01:49:15;"written by this guy Stephen Holden,"
01:49:15;01:49:18;"who I think now is a film critic for ""The New York Times."""
01:49:18;01:49:19;"- Yeah, the biggest."
01:49:19;01:49:21;"- Really interesting review,"
01:49:21;01:49:24;"and he was writing about how he saw ""Tusk"""
01:49:24;01:49:28;"as an example of the sort of lush California pop aesthetic"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"that started with Phil Spector and Brian Wilson"
01:49:31;01:49:35;"straight through the Eagles and into ""Rumors,"""
01:49:35;01:49:36;"how that had run its course,"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"and then after ""Rumors,"" a band like Fleetwood Mac"
01:49:39;01:49:43;"saw no other way but then to kind of, like,"
01:49:43;01:49:46;"pump the brakes and go a different direction."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"- Right."
01:49:47;01:49:50;"- And so that ties in, actually, to your funny, like,"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"Lindsey Buckingham biopic scene."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"- Right."
01:49:53;01:49:56;"- Of him seeing the, like, studio professionals that were--"
01:49:56;01:50:00;"- Literally the human equivalent of that kind of lush,"
01:50:00;01:50:03;"slightly overblown California aesthetic"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"that you're talking about, which is, you know,"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"the California cliche, and we all know,"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"we all spend a lot of time here, it's not true,"
01:50:08;01:50:12;"but the cliche of California is that life's easy, man."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Sun's always shining."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"I can wear a Hawaiian shirt, who cares?"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"I can grow my hair long."
01:50:17;01:50:20;"So in some ways, these engineers with their big beards"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"and long hair and Hawaiian shirts"
01:50:21;01:50:24;"were the human equivalent of that kind of lush aesthetic"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"that you're talking about."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"So it's understandable that Lindsey would react"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"to them viscerally."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"He wasn't just fighting those guys,"
01:50:32;01:50:33;"he was fighting an idea."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"- So to me, it's interesting, I mean, it's like,"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"they're, like, the biggest band in the world,"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"they're spending all kinds of money,"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"huge expectations."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"In one sense, there's a lot of hubris with Tusk,"
01:50:43;01:50:46;"but in the other sense, there's a lot of experimentation."
01:50:46;01:50:50;"It's like a weird mix between, like, glossiness"
01:50:50;01:50:53;"and, like, roughness and, like, perfection"
01:50:53;01:50:58;"and imperfection, and it's, like, deliberately imperfect."
01:50:58;01:51:01;"It's a, you know, 'cause, like, Rumor's was, like, airtight."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"- Right."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"This is their Yeezus."
01:51:04;01:51:05;"- Kind of."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"- I think you kind of have to do that as an artist, right?"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"You do this thing, you do it really well, it's airtight,"
01:51:09;01:51:12;"and then the next thing you do is you have to break that open,"
01:51:12;01:51:14;"even if it's not pretty, even if people are disappointed,"
01:51:14;01:51:17;"even if you lose some people, you have to do that."
01:51:17;01:51:18;"- Absolutely."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"And I think in the long run, it proves to be a wise path."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"- Yeah, it didn't, I mean, it doesn't take away"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"from how anybody feels about Fleetwood Mac,"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"it probably only adds value."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"- But it took away from them at the time."
01:51:29;01:51:30;"- But now, I'm saying."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"- Right."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"- Looking back."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"- But at the time, it must have been harsh."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"- Yeah, it must have felt not great."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"- Well, imagine that you're Lindsey."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"You walked into that room."
01:51:37;01:51:40;"You shamed those guys with long hair."
01:51:40;01:51:43;"You kind of put his reputation on the line a bit."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"And then this album, it's not like Tusk connected"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"with the punk rockers, did it?"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"- No, I mean, I don't think."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Maybe he probably is, too."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- I mean, yeah, like, come on, you're like some dude"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"with a mohawk."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"You would never give Fleetwood Mac a chance, ever."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"- Yeah, no, it's weird, soft rock."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"- So he went for something, and maybe he didn't really"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"end up with a pop audience or with an edgy punk audience."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"- Right."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"- But you know what he ended up with 30 years later?"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"A very dedicated audience."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"- Absolutely."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"- How should we wrap things up for Tusk?"
01:52:08;01:52:11;"- Let's do ""Honey, Hi,"" which is a Christine McVie song."
01:52:11;01:52:13;"- Oh, this song's so good."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"- Really sweet song."
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Love it."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"Great recording."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"[MUSIC - TUSK, ""HONEY, HI""]"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"- (SINGING) Honey, honey, honey."
01:52:20;01:52:28;"You could be sweeter than you."
01:52:28;01:52:35;"Honey, honey, honey."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"Honey, honey, honey."
01:52:36;01:52:42;"Better sweet than broken-eyed."
01:52:42;01:52:51;"Oh, it's good to talk to you."
01:52:51;01:52:58;"You're sweeter than wine."
01:53:03;01:53:07;"Oh, don't take the love that I bring."
01:53:07;01:53:13;"'Cause I'm far away from home."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"[MUSIC - TUSK, ""HONEY, HI""]"
01:53:16;01:53:35;"Honey, all I'm trying to tell you."
01:53:40;01:53:43;"Lord, I really love you."
01:53:43;01:53:50;"Honey, honey, honey, hi."
01:53:57;01:54:05;"Honey, honey, honey, hi."
01:54:05;01:54:09;"Oh, I'm far away from home."
01:54:09;01:54:13;"Honey, honey, honey, hi."
01:54:13;01:54:17;"Oh, I'm far away from home."
01:54:17;01:54:20;"Honey, honey, honey, hi."
01:54:20;01:54:24;"Oh, I'm far away from home."
01:54:24;01:54:26;"Honey, honey, honey, hi."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"- That was ""Honey, Hi"" from the Fluid & Mack album Tusk."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Jake, thank you so much for breaking down--"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"- Yeah, man."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- --this wonderful album for us."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"Rashida, you said you weren't very familiar with that album."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Have you been converted?"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Yeah, I like it."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"I realized I knew the song Tusk, and I really like it."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"And I like ""Honey, Hi."""
01:54:40;01:54:41;"It's great."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"[MUSIC - TUSK, ""HONEY, HI""]"
01:54:42;01:54:48;"- You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beat One."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- Let's get into some more music."
01:54:49;01:54:53;"Hearing ""Honey, Hi"" made me think of a band that some people"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"compared to Fluid & Mack, I think because of Stevie Nicks."
01:54:57;01:55:01;"And this is a song by a band we all know, Hyme,"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"produced by a friend of the show, Ariel Rechshied."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"This is their song with a similar name, ""Honey and I."""
01:55:06;01:55:09;"And this is one of my favorite Hyme songs, so let's get into that."
01:55:09;01:55:16;"[MUSIC - HYME, ""HONEY, HI""]"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"- Oh."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"Same chord regression."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- And it's--"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"[MUSIC - HYME, ""HONEY, HI""]"
01:55:23;01:55:26;"- (SINGING) Good night."
01:55:26;01:55:29;"I know there's nothing good in goodbye."
01:55:29;01:55:33;"But you lead me to no other line, no other line."
01:55:33;01:55:39;"Eyes wide open when you walked through that door."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"You made your way across the floor."
01:55:42;01:55:49;"All the little girls had a drive that turns, drive that turns."
01:55:49;01:55:55;"But oh, no, no, no, see I'm not afraid no more."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"- Not afraid no more."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"- To turn you away no more."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"- Turn you away no more."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"- To turn you away, to turn you away."
01:56:01;01:56:06;"'Cause my honey and I, yeah."
01:56:06;01:56:12;"My honey and I, my honey and I, my honey and I,"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"do, do just fine, yeah."
01:56:14;01:56:18;"My honey and I, yeah."
01:56:18;01:56:24;"My honey and I, my honey and I, my honey and I,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"do, do just fine, yeah."
01:56:27;01:56:31;"[MUSIC - HYME, ""LOVE, LOVE, LOVE""]"
01:56:31;01:56:35;"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
01:56:35;01:56:40;"I don't love you just because love wasn't what I thought it"
01:56:40;01:56:41;"once was."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"But I thought it once was."
01:56:43;01:56:48;"Telling each other everything, picking out the old wedding"
01:56:48;01:56:48;"rings."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"And oh, now I know."
01:56:50;01:56:54;"And now I see I'm not afraid no more."
01:56:55;01:56:59;"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:56:59;01:57:04;"So why are you always trying to stay at home?"
01:57:04;01:57:05;"- Why are you staying there?"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"- The song can't be played enough for me."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"- The song can't be played enough."
01:57:09;01:57:15;"- It was made to be played with my honey and I, yeah."
01:57:15;01:57:21;"My honey and I, my honey and I, my honey and I,"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"do, do just fine, yeah."
01:57:23;01:57:45;"Honey in the commenteds."
01:57:45;01:58:01;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this."
01:58:01;01:58:27;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this."
01:58:27;01:58:53;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this."
01:58:53;01:59:07;"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this."
01:59:07;01:59:10;"Wow, Time Crisis 7."
01:59:10;01:59:13;"This one was a real time crisis, I would say."
01:59:13;01:59:16;"We counted down the hits of 1979, 2015."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"Jake took us through Tusk."
01:59:18;01:59:20;"We've been joined in the studio by Rashida Jones."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"Thank you so much."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"Thanks for having me."
01:59:22;01:59:23;"It was so fun."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"It was fun and educational."
01:59:25;01:59:27;"And you taught us quite a bit too."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"We all learned."
01:59:28;01:59:32;"We all learned from each other on this rare power trio edition of Time Crisis."
01:59:32;01:59:34;"I hope everybody's enjoying their Sunday."
01:59:34;01:59:37;"I hope you're using it as a time for quiet reflection."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"Maybe get some exercise."
01:59:38;01:59:41;"You haven't moved that much this week."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Maybe got an office job."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Maybe it's time to move those feet."
01:59:45;01:59:46;"You know, but don't be too hard on yourself."
01:59:46;01:59:48;"You want to have a little dessert."
01:59:48;01:59:49;"It is Sunday after all."
01:59:49;01:59:54;"We'll be right back in the same place in two weeks with Time Crisis number 8."
01:59:54;01:59:59;"Taking us out of here is the British group Underworld with a big hit from the 90s, Born"
01:59:59;01:59:59;"Slippy."
