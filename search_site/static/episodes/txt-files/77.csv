00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back once again. On today's episode, we really explore classic rock."
00:06;00:12;"We're talking Grateful Dead, John Mellencamp, Jim Morrison, and Steve Miller."
00:12;00:20;"It's quite the episode. Buckle up and stay tuned. This is dot dot dot."
00:20;00:24;"Dot dot dot."
00:24;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-b-b-b-b-b-beats one."
00:32;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:38;00:45;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:45;00:52;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:10;01:14;"We were only there"
01:14;01:18;"Alright, Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:18;01:21;"Not a whole lot, man. Time Crisis '77."
01:21;01:24;"This is Time Crisis '77. So..."
01:24;01:26;"There's some symmetry there."
01:26;01:29;"Yeah, definitely some symmetry. That's the year you were born."
01:29;01:31;"The famous year for the Grateful Dead."
01:31;01:32;"Cornell show."
01:32;01:37;"That's right. Did you see that the Dead just dropped this gigantic box set?"
01:37;01:38;"No."
01:38;01:41;"You might be into it. It's the complete Pacific Northwest recordings."
01:41;01:42;"Oh my god."
01:42;01:44;"'73 to '74, I believe."
01:44;01:46;"So it's only two years."
01:46;01:51;"Well, I think in the box set, you're getting hours and hours of the full shows."
01:51;01:52;"Vinyl?"
01:52;01:53;"CDs?"
01:53;01:57;"That must be CDs and it comes with all little trinkets and this and that."
01:57;02:01;"There appears to be a 45 minute playing in the band."
02:01;02:03;"Oh wow, they go to the minor part."
02:03;02:05;"Yeah, maybe for like a solid 15."
02:05;02:09;"Yeah, because the song is D major, but then starting like mid-late 70s,"
02:09;02:13;"we go to this like extended D minor jam."
02:13;02:16;"Like no movement, just like a jam."
02:16;02:17;"Just go full minor."
02:17;02:19;"A jam in D minor for like, yeah, 15."
02:19;02:21;"45 is outlandish."
02:21;02:26;"Jerry just starts working in that F, that minor third."
02:26;02:27;"I guess, yeah."
02:27;02:31;"And then everybody falls on-- yeah, I didn't-- I'll have to set aside some time."
02:31;02:34;"That's rough stuff."
02:34;02:36;"That's rough stuff, folks."
02:36;02:39;"45 minutes playing."
02:39;02:42;"That's pushing it for even the most devout Deadheads."
02:42;02:45;"I just want to be clear about this for our non-Deadhead listeners."
02:45;02:49;"Playing in the band is a song, so we're talking about a 45 minute,"
02:49;02:54;"which is way beyond the typical Dead jam."
02:54;02:59;"Yeah, usually their songs are clocking in around like 8, sometimes like 10."
02:59;03:00;"8 to 12 minutes, yeah."
03:00;03:03;"Also, playing in the band is a cool song."
03:03;03:06;"I love the version on the first-- like the first version that was released,"
03:06;03:08;"which was on Skull and Roses."
03:08;03:09;"Good song."
03:09;03:11;"One of Bob's best."
03:11;03:12;"Yeah, it's just kind of a funny song."
03:12;03:13;"There's these really beautiful guitar parts."
03:13;03:16;"[singing]"
03:16;03:20;"In the beginning, but then the actual, like, verses of the song--"
03:20;03:21;"Throw it on."
03:21;03:23;"Let's just take this all the way."
03:23;03:25;"I think I've got to throw on this 45 minute--"
03:25;03:26;"Oh, my God."
03:26;03:27;"--playing in the band."
03:27;03:30;"First hour of the show today is going to be dedicated to--"
03:30;03:31;"That'd be kind of--"
03:31;03:33;"19 disc companion."
03:33;03:35;"Who wants CDs?"
03:35;03:36;"Some Deadheads."
03:36;03:38;"They're buying it for the box."
03:38;03:39;"It's an art objet."
03:39;03:40;"Yeah."
03:40;03:41;"An objet d'art."
03:41;03:42;"Yeah, I get it."
03:42;03:43;"You know--"
03:43;03:44;"Shout out to the Grateful Dead."
03:44;03:46;"I got a DM from somebody at Grateful Dead,"
03:46;03:49;"which, you know, definitely is not somebody in the band."
03:49;03:53;"Probably somebody who works for Rhino, who's in charge of their archives."
03:53;03:56;"But I got a DM on Instagram, although this is while I was in Japan,"
03:56;03:58;"so I was all turned around time-wise."
03:58;04:01;"So I got a DM, you know, I was pretty psyched."
04:01;04:03;"I saw the Grateful Dead slid in my DMs, and they were asking,"
04:03;04:08;"""Do you want to premiere a song from this, like, forthcoming box set?"""
04:08;04:09;"And then--"
04:09;04:10;"Looks like it's happening."
04:10;04:11;"Yeah, I missed it."
04:11;04:12;"I missed the window."
04:12;04:13;"I'm sorry."
04:13;04:14;"I put them in touch with my management."
04:14;04:15;"So shout out to whoever hit me up."
04:15;04:17;"They probably--I think they said they listen to Time Crisis,"
04:17;04:19;"so they knew there's a Dead connection."
04:19;04:20;"So shout out to them."
04:20;04:22;"Next time hit up Time Crisis."
04:22;04:23;"That's better than hitting me up."
04:23;04:26;"But they were like, ""Do you want to--would you like to premiere"
04:26;04:31;"this, like, 1974 Eyes of the World on your Instagram?"""
04:31;04:32;"And I was kind of like--"
04:32;04:33;"What?"
04:33;04:34;"So at first I was just like in Japan."
04:34;04:35;"I was like, ""Hell yeah!"""
04:35;04:38;"And then I thought about it, and I was like, ""Wait, what does it mean to premiere it?"""
04:38;04:40;"Surely there must be tapes out there."
04:40;04:43;"Richard Pictures has covered playing in the band a few times."
04:43;04:45;"How far do you take it?"
04:45;04:46;"We'll take it out."
04:46;04:49;"I think we've done, like, a good 10 or 12-minute version."
04:49;04:51;"And you always take it to the minor part?"
04:51;04:53;"Yeah, although I prefer not to."
04:53;04:56;"It's actually a bit of a bone of contention within the band."
04:56;04:57;"Really?"
04:57;05:01;"I like to do the strictly, like, 1970, '71 version,"
05:01;05:03;"kind of more like the country rock version."
05:03;05:08;"Yep, playing in the band live at the Heck Edmondson Pavilion."
05:08;05:09;"Where's that?"
05:09;05:12;"This is University of Washington, Seattle."
05:12;05:13;"Okay."
05:13;05:16;"This version's 46 minutes, 31 seconds."
05:16;05:17;"Wow."
05:17;05:20;"That'd be just so tight any time we don't feel like doing the whole show."
05:20;05:21;"We're just like--"
05:21;05:24;"And now we're going to throw to some music from The Grateful Dead."
05:24;05:28;"Here's a really hot rendition of playing in the band from--"
05:28;05:30;"And then we're just gone for 45 minutes."
05:30;05:32;"And then come back in like, ""Wow, that was--"""
05:32;05:33;"[laughs]"
05:33;05:54;"[playing in the band]"
05:54;05:56;"There's just like certain Dead songs that, from the jump,"
05:56;05:58;"are so vibey that you expect it."
05:58;06:00;"But it's like, you just heard this, and you're like,"
06:00;06:03;"""This is going to go on for 45 minutes."""
06:03;06:05;"[singing]"
06:05;06:07;"And the chorus is just so simple."
06:07;06:10;"Yeah, this is like a Buddy Holly song, kind of."
06:10;06:11;"Yeah."
06:11;06:13;"[playing in the band]"
06:13;06:15;"But then this part, this is the crunch."
06:15;06:18;"Okay, so what happens, this is in D major."
06:18;06:20;"Then they start doing this part in D minor."
06:20;06:21;"Right."
06:21;06:22;"[singing]"
06:22;06:23;"Like, whatever, like the--"
06:23;06:25;"You know what a song's in D major?"
06:25;06:26;"No."
06:26;06:28;"Cape Cod, ""Cuasa Cuasa."""
06:28;06:30;"Dude, go to a minor jam."
06:30;06:32;"We never took it minor."
06:32;06:33;"That's how you go 12 minute."
06:33;06:36;"We started taking it like vaguely mixolydian."
06:36;06:41;"I mean, also keep in mind, we barely played it."
06:41;06:43;"We've only had a few opportunities."
06:43;06:46;"Dude, this is the new version of the shirt/concept."
06:46;06:48;"45 minute Cape Cod."
06:48;06:56;"[playing in the band]"
06:56;06:59;"Daybreak on the land."
06:59;07:01;"I'm just going to skip ahead."
07:01;07:04;"Now we're at 11 minutes."
07:04;07:05;"This is kind of tight."
07:05;07:07;"I don't think we've ever just skipped around"
07:07;07:09;"in a Grateful Dead jam on this show."
07:09;07:11;"It's about time."
07:11;07:16;"[playing in the band]"
07:16;07:18;"Coizmoose is going off."
07:18;07:30;"[playing in the band]"
07:30;07:33;"Definitely getting some different territory."
07:33;07:35;"We've already descended into it."
07:35;07:37;"Yeah, it's pre-jazz."
07:37;07:43;"[playing in the band]"
07:43;07:45;"It's all good folks, we've got another 30 of this."
07:45;07:48;"[playing in the band]"
07:48;07:50;"Go forward to minute 18."
07:50;07:52;"University of Seattle."
07:52;07:54;"How are you doing?"
07:54;07:59;"[playing in the band]"
07:59;08:01;"Is this 18?"
08:01;08:03;"This is only 15."
08:03;08:08;"[playing in the band]"
08:08;08:11;"It's getting funky."
08:11;08:12;"Oh wow."
08:12;08:16;"Ooh, yeah."
08:16;08:20;"I want to hear Jerry just tearing it up."
08:20;08:27;"[playing in the band]"
08:27;08:29;"It's a little stop/start in the middle."
08:29;08:36;"[playing in the band]"
08:36;08:38;"You said minute 27."
08:38;08:48;"[playing in the band]"
08:48;08:50;"31."
08:50;08:59;"[playing in the band]"
08:59;09:02;"This part is getting back to some late 60s psychedelic vibe."
09:02;09:04;"Yeah."
09:04;09:08;"[playing in the band]"
09:08;09:09;"Minute 37."
09:09;09:11;"That was a harsh tone from Jerry."
09:11;09:13;"Almost reminded me of John McLaughlin or something."
09:13;09:15;"Yeah."
09:15;09:17;"[playing in the band]"
09:17;09:20;"Or like some early, yeah, early, early death."
09:20;09:22;"We're coming hot out of the gates on this show."
09:22;09:24;"We're at minute 37."
09:24;09:26;"[playing in the band]"
09:26;09:28;"Minute 41."
09:28;09:30;"[playing in the band]"
09:30;09:32;"So when they're going to jump back into it,"
09:32;09:43;"[playing in the band]"
09:43;09:45;"I feel like they're kind of hinting at it."
09:45;09:56;"[playing in the band]"
09:56;09:58;"I wonder if this song is just like,"
09:58;10:00;"it's just one of the discs."
10:00;10:08;"[playing in the band]"
10:08;10:11;"You can hear the keys a little more here."
10:11;10:22;"[playing in the band]"
10:22;10:24;"Okay, now here it's coming back."
10:24;10:30;"[playing in the band]"
10:30;10:33;"This is at minute 44."
10:33;10:35;"[playing in the band]"
10:35;10:37;"Ha ha, yeah!"
10:37;10:51;"[playing in the band]"
10:51;10:56;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
10:56;10:58;"Seinfeld got scared by that."
10:58;11:00;"That's Donna, right?"
11:00;11:02;"Seinfeld was terrified."
11:02;11:04;"Rough stuff, folks."
11:04;11:06;"Donna's rough."
11:06;11:08;"Come on, she's good."
11:08;11:10;"[playing in the band]"
11:10;11:28;"[playing in the band]"
11:28;11:30;"I like the thing about Donna just like,"
11:30;11:33;"fully leaving the stage during the jam,"
11:33;11:35;"and just like catching a full episode of like,"
11:35;11:37;"M*A*S*H or something."
11:37;11:40;"Ha ha, coming back."
11:40;11:48;"[playing in the band]"
11:48;11:54;"Just taking down a couple long-form articles in Esquire."
11:54;11:56;"Yeah."
11:56;12:06;"[playing in the band]"
12:06;12:08;"This part sounds great."
12:08;12:10;"Yeah."
12:10;12:21;"[playing in the band]"
12:21;12:23;"Phil."
12:23;12:25;"[laughing]"
12:25;12:27;"In the Phil zone."
12:27;12:32;"[playing in the band]"
12:32;12:37;"Phil's got some weird like, flange or something on his bass."
12:37;12:40;"Okay, so the official title of this box set is"
12:40;12:44;"Pacific Northwest '73 to '74, Believe It If You Need It."
12:44;12:47;"There's a box of rain, I know that's one of your favorite songs, Jake."
12:47;12:48;"Oh yeah."
12:48;12:50;"Anyway, so we saw each other last weekend."
12:50;12:51;"Yeah, man."
12:51;12:52;"Jake and I were at the same wedding."
12:52;12:54;"My brother, friend of the show."
12:54;12:56;"That's right, friend of the show Dave Longstreth tied the--"
12:56;12:58;"[laughing]"
12:58;12:59;"That's the morning news."
12:59;13:03;"Friend of the show Dave Longstreth tied the knot this past weekend"
13:03;13:05;"up in Northern California."
13:05;13:09;"Very exclusive private ceremony attended by only a few friends and family."
13:09;13:12;"No, there were like, I don't know, like 40-something people there."
13:12;13:13;"It was tight."
13:13;13:14;"I was guesstimating 50."
13:14;13:15;"Yeah, I think that's probably--"
13:15;13:16;"50 tops."
13:16;13:17;"Solid guess."
13:17;13:19;"First wedding you've been to since your own?"
13:19;13:22;"Are you--oh, you hit a lot of weddings with Hannah, your wife."
13:22;13:24;"It's true."
13:24;13:27;"I feel like you're always like, you go into like Wisconsin for the weekend for a wedding."
13:27;13:29;"Yeah, that did happen last summer."
13:29;13:31;"I feel like we hit one this summer."
13:31;13:33;"It was a lovely wedding, lovely ceremony."
13:33;13:35;"Yeah, powerful vows exchanged."
13:35;13:37;"And Jake, you gave the best speech at the wedding."
13:37;13:38;"That's one thing I want to talk about."
13:38;13:39;"Oh, thanks."
13:39;13:42;"Not that the other speeches were bad."
13:42;13:45;"It's just that one thing I noticed about this wedding,"
13:45;13:49;"one wedding I went to maybe two or three years ago was a lot of like Hollywood types."
13:49;13:54;"So there were like legit comedy writers getting up and just like one-upping each other."
13:54;13:55;"Like world-class performers."
13:55;13:56;"World-class performers."
13:56;13:58;"Wow, that's just fun to witness."
13:58;14:01;"And just roasting the bride and groom or whatever."
14:01;14:04;"But at this wedding, you're the only person who went for kind of like--"
14:04;14:06;"and maybe that's what the brother is supposed to do,"
14:06;14:10;"like that right mix of like praise, little bit of humor."
14:10;14:12;"Although you didn't really do actually any light ribbing."
14:12;14:13;"No, no ribbing."
14:13;14:15;"There was some humor, but no like--"
14:15;14:17;"No embarrassing stories."
14:17;14:18;"No busting."
14:18;14:20;"My dad was kind of busting."
14:20;14:21;"In a dad way."
14:21;14:23;"Yeah, you told a nice story about how--"
14:23;14:24;"Yeah."
14:24;14:25;"What did you say?"
14:25;14:28;"You just always knew Dave had a lot of gumption because he carried a canoe on his back for a mile."
14:28;14:30;"Yeah, like we went to this summer camp when we were kids,"
14:30;14:36;"and like you try to like compete and like do stuff to get these funny little awards when you're at summer camp."
14:36;14:41;"But a lot of it is like sort of like swim a mile or like get this score in archery."
14:41;14:44;"Like very like classic summer camp stuff."
14:44;14:49;"And one of the things that Dave took upon himself to do was portage a canoe."
14:49;14:50;"This is when he was like 12 or 13."
14:50;14:54;"Right, I found your speech interesting because I wasn't familiar with the phrase ""portage a canoe."""
14:54;14:58;"Right, I actually explained it to everyone because I sensed in the room on the cuff that I was like,"
14:58;15:01;"""Hmm, maybe portage a canoe is not in everyone's lexicon."""
15:01;15:07;"Now we've all portaged a canoe, but how many of us have portaged a canoe for one mile at the age of 11?"
15:08;15:10;"What's up? How's it going?"
15:10;15:12;"Do your real cheat form"
15:12;15:14;"She is so dreamy"
15:14;15:17;"Like she got features on Fellini"
15:17;15:19;"Deadpan, unimpressed"
15:19;15:21;"Archimedes, I'm obsessed"
15:21;15:23;"Just hanging out"
15:23;15:26;"Oh, Julian Casablancas"
15:26;15:28;"She is an epiphany"
15:28;15:30;"Of her electricity"
15:30;15:32;"Opens my days"
15:32;15:35;"Like she always knew"
15:35;15:38;"I'm feeling up in a tank"
15:38;15:40;"I'm emmited deadly"
15:40;15:44;"In all the ways she's a race through"
15:44;15:46;"Yeah, no, so what is portaging a canoe again?"
15:46;15:50;"It's carrying a canoe solo over land."
15:50;15:53;"But portaging is also a very specific style."
15:53;15:57;"It's like the canoe's flipped over, so you're like, it's resting."
15:57;16:01;"Yeah, so like the cross braces in the middle of the canoe"
16:01;16:05;"That you might like sit on, or that might form the like"
16:05;16:09;"Butcher thing to like form the seat that you would sit on if you're paddling a canoe"
16:09;16:12;"Those cross braces are then put on your shoulders."
16:12;16:14;"And that's kind of part of the design?"
16:14;16:19;"Yeah, because like there's situations where you're having to go from one body of water to the other."
16:19;16:23;"You gotta take it from this lake to some other lake."
16:23;16:26;"Today's time crisis, we're talking canoe portaging."
16:26;16:29;"Give us a call, let us know how you like to portage your canoes."
16:29;16:31;"Have you ever had to..."
16:31;16:33;"There's the Wisconsin method."
16:33;16:35;"Have you ever done a canoe hiking trip?"
16:35;16:37;"I have."
16:37;16:39;"So you had to portage it sometimes?"
16:39;16:41;"Yes, when I was a kid at camp."
16:41;16:43;"God, it sounds intense."
16:43;16:46;"And you would like, you'd have all your gear in like a waterproof backpack."
16:46;16:48;"That's in the canoe."
16:48;16:51;"And then you like are canoeing across this huge lake in like Maine."
16:51;16:55;"Then you get to the shore, and then there's another lake that starts"
16:55;16:59;"because there's areas like in Maine called the Rangeley Lakes that have like lots of lakes."
16:59;17:02;"Or like Minnesota, land of a thousand lakes."
17:02;17:04;"So the lakes are like separated."
17:04;17:07;"I bet Minnesota, they're portaging canoes all day."
17:07;17:09;"Left and right."
17:09;17:14;"So then you're like, oh, it's three quarters of a mile or it's three miles to the next lake."
17:14;17:19;"We gotta go from Lake Elmhurst to this other lake."
17:19;17:20;"Boom, on your shoulders."
17:20;17:24;"It's like you rollerblade to work, then you gotta take your rollerblades off"
17:24;17:26;"because you can't wear them in the lobby."
17:26;17:28;"Then you gotta sling them around your shoulders when you get in the elevator."
17:28;17:30;"You're sort of portaging your rollerblades."
17:30;17:35;"Or if you ride your bike to the subway, and then you have to get off the bike and take it in the subway,"
17:35;17:36;"you're kind of portaging your bike."
17:36;17:42;"You know what's so stressful is when people put the bike on the rack on the front of the bus."
17:42;17:43;"Do you see that?"
17:43;17:46;"Like the city bus vibe and there's like a huge bike rack."
17:46;17:51;"But I never understand how it works with like if other people put their bike on top of yours,"
17:51;17:56;"and then you're the next stop, and then you have to like find the guy that put his bike on top of yours."
17:56;17:57;"You know what I'm saying?"
17:57;17:59;"And it's all happening while the bus is idling at a bus stop."
17:59;18:02;"Yeah, and you can just picture all these other people who--"
18:02;18:06;"obviously this is not entirely true, but I feel like in New York there's a slight thing that"
18:06;18:13;"the people who bike and then get on the bus probably have a little more time on their hands than everybody else."
18:13;18:14;"Maybe that's not fair."
18:14;18:15;"I just feel like in broad strokes."
18:15;18:16;"Wait, why?"
18:16;18:22;"I guess I'm just picturing like who's like an older person still working, sitting on the bus waiting,"
18:22;18:27;"and then I'm just picturing just like me basically just being like, ""Hold up, hold up."
18:27;18:29;"Got to secure my bike."""
18:29;18:31;"And just like everybody--you know what I mean?"
18:31;18:33;"Sort of like a Ned Flanders kind of move."

19:44;19:46;"I agree fully with this."
19:46;19:48;"""Let's face it, portaging really hurts."

20:02;20:04;"who never seems to take their share of the load."""
20:04;20:08;"Okay, so there's a lot to unpack in the world of portaging."
20:08;20:11;"This is precisely why I told the portaging story."
20:11;20:13;"At the toast at my brother's wedding."
20:13;20:15;"I really get it, that it's portaging--"
20:15;20:18;"I was like, ""This kid is cut from a different cloth."""
20:18;20:21;"Portaging represents taking pain unto yourself"
20:21;20:22;"to achieve something great."
20:22;20:24;"Sheer determination and grit."
20:24;20:26;"To make it from one body of water to the next."
20:26;20:29;"I was saying Dave has a very powerful work ethic."
20:29;20:31;"How old was he when he won the portaging award?"
20:31;20:33;"I don't know, 12 or 13?"
20:33;20:34;"Right."
20:34;20:36;"But I also mentioned that when we were kids--"
20:36;20:39;"Like some 12 or 13-year-old dudes are like young men."
20:39;20:40;"Right."
20:40;20:42;"But we were like shrimps. We were like true--"
20:42;20:44;"Oh, you're just talking about body type."
20:44;20:45;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
20:45;20:47;"Oh, yeah, that was a funny part of the thing."
20:47;20:49;"You said that-- you said like the long-shaved boys"
20:49;20:51;"were true 98-pound weaklings."
20:51;20:53;"Yeah, bean poles."
20:53;20:55;"You missed the night before the wedding."
20:55;20:57;"There was a slideshow that my dad put together."
20:57;21:00;"And there were a lot of photographs of me and Dave."
21:00;21:04;"And when I was like a teenager, into my 20s,"
21:04;21:06;"I looked malnourished."
21:06;21:07;"Really?"
21:07;21:09;"I looked like I was deeply underweight."
21:09;21:10;"And it was just like--"
21:10;21:14;"Into your 20s, so even when you were at college,"
21:14;21:16;"slamming brews, late-night pizza slices,"
21:16;21:17;"you just--"
21:17;21:19;"Yeah, metabolism just tore through it."
21:19;21:21;"You're just one of those lucky guys."
21:21;21:23;"Well, but it really wasn't like--"
21:23;21:25;"I didn't look good, especially--"
21:25;21:28;"well, also '90s, like the clothes were sort of baggy."
21:28;21:31;"So a combination of just being like a super thin,"
21:31;21:35;"pale, kind of like gaunt dude with baggy clothes,"
21:35;21:37;"sort of like 1998."
21:37;21:39;"Rough stuff, folks."
21:39;21:42;"Pictures of my college era, it's just brutal."
21:42;21:44;"It's hard to wax nostalgic about college"
21:44;21:46;"when you look back at the photos of you,"
21:46;21:48;"and you're just like, Jesus Christ."
21:48;21:50;"I was at my max weight in college, actually."
21:50;21:53;"I actually remember seeing a photo of you a while ago."
21:53;21:55;"Maybe-- oh, well, that's when I met you."
21:55;21:56;"We did that tour."
21:56;22:00;"And I was like, damn, Ezra looks pudgy."
22:00;22:02;"I think it was like a photo from when we played"
22:02;22:04;"at some place in Baltimore or something."
22:04;22:07;"It's gone up and down, yeah, 'cause I recently got a scale."
22:07;22:08;"Congratulations."
22:08;22:09;"I just felt like the truth--"
22:09;22:11;"I've not been eating well at all lately,"
22:11;22:14;"which doesn't bode well for any forthcoming"
22:14;22:17;"Vampire Weekend Press or things of that nature."
22:17;22:18;"You know what's cool?"
22:18;22:20;"You know how I talk about how nobody likes the doors anymore?"
22:20;22:21;"Yeah."
22:21;22:25;"I was just researching the doors, as one does."
22:25;22:28;"And I always think about, too, how in this era,"
22:28;22:31;"when obviously we talk so much in this era"
22:31;22:33;"about who's saying the right thing,"
22:33;22:35;"who's saying the right thing now,"
22:35;22:37;"but they said the wrong thing before."
22:37;22:39;"You know, like people digging up old tweets"
22:39;22:40;"from somebody from five years ago."
22:40;22:42;"See, I knew you were a piece of [bleep]"
22:42;22:45;"I'm not commenting on it, but we know that's been going on."
22:45;22:47;"But I always think about the people"
22:47;22:49;"who just said the right thing decades ago,"
22:49;22:51;"when it wasn't particularly fashionable,"
22:51;22:53;"when you weren't getting props for it."
22:53;22:56;"So I even think about how even in my lifetime,"
22:56;22:59;"the word ""fat shaming"" only kind of came to prominence."
22:59;23:01;"I'm sure it's existed for a long time,"
23:01;23:04;"but I don't remember being a kid and being in school"
23:04;23:06;"and people talk about being nice to each other"
23:06;23:08;"and they would say, ""Don't be mean to an overweight person"
23:08;23:09;"because you're fat shaming."""
23:09;23:10;"That just word wasn't around."
23:10;23:11;"Yeah."
23:11;23:13;"Anybody with a heart knew that it was cruel"
23:13;23:15;"to make fun of anybody for their appearance or whatever."
23:15;23:18;"But my point is that I just feel like back in the day,"
23:18;23:20;"as recently as 10 years ago,"
23:20;23:23;"because I was recently watching the Eddie Murphy film Norbit."
23:23;23:25;"I don't know why, but I wanted to watch Norbit."
23:25;23:27;"And I realized later it's because I thought it was Bowfinger."
23:27;23:29;"Because I know that there are Eddie Murphy movies"
23:29;23:32;"from the same era where he kind of plays a nerd."
23:32;23:35;"And I was like, ""I've heard that that movie is good."""
23:35;23:37;"And then somehow I thought it was Norbit."
23:37;23:39;"And so Norbit, almost all the jokes"
23:39;23:41;"are about him playing an overweight woman."
23:41;23:43;"So it's just really absurd stuff."
23:43;23:46;"She goes on a water slide and then she goes bust through a wall."
23:46;23:48;"Just kind of like, you're just like, ""What?"""
23:48;23:51;"Just feels so dated and it's only 12, 13 years ago."
23:51;23:54;"So I was really interested when I came across"
23:54;23:57;"this Jim Morrison interview on YouTube."
23:57;23:59;"And when did he--he died in the early '70s."
23:59;24:01;"- Yeah. - So Jim Morrison,"
24:01;24:04;"he was known as somebody who publicly dealt with his weight."
24:04;24:06;"I don't even want to say dealt with his weight"
24:06;24:08;"because who knows what he thought about it."
24:08;24:10;"But when he came out, he had a very specific look."
24:10;24:12;"And then later--you know, some people would joke about,"
24:12;24:14;"""Oh, then when he got on drugs, like, then he got fat."""
24:14;24:17;"So, you know, that was the thing people talked about with Jim Morrison."
24:17;24:20;"But here's this interview that I found. Early '70s."
24:20;24:22;"You put on a lot of weight. Are you eating a lot?"
24:22;24:24;"So did you hear that, what the interviewer said?"
24:24;24:26;"Yeah, yeah. You put on a lot of weight. Are you eating a lot?"
24:26;24:28;"Yeah. Okay, so this is from 1969, by the way."
24:28;24:31;"Well, um..."
24:31;24:36;"You know, that's something that's--that really bothers me."
24:36;24:39;"What's wrong with being fat?"
24:39;24:41;"That's what I want to know. Why is there such--"
24:41;24:43;"I didn't say there was anything wrong with it."
24:43;24:47;"Why is it so onerous to be fat?"
24:47;24:50;"Um..."
24:50;24:52;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
24:52;24:55;"I felt like a tank, you know?"
24:55;25:00;"I felt like a--like a large mammal."
25:00;25:02;"A big beast."
25:02;25:06;"When I moved through the corridors or across the lawn,"
25:06;25:11;"I just feel like I could knock anybody out of my way, you know?"
25:11;25:12;"I was solid, man."
25:12;25:13;"Is this part real?"
25:13;25:16;"Terrible to be thin and wispy because--"
25:16;25:17;"I think so."
25:17;25:22;"You could--you could get knocked over by a strong wind or something."
25:22;25:24;"I guess he's kind of skinny-shaming."
25:24;25:26;"Fat is beautiful."
25:26;25:28;"How much do you weigh now?"
25:28;25:30;"I don't know. To tell you the truth,"
25:30;25:34;"I guess somewhere in the neighborhood of about 150."
25:34;25:35;"More than that, buddy."
25:35;25:37;"Well, maybe he was short."
25:37;25:39;"Completely crapping on his point."
25:39;25:41;"Yeah, I don't know. Okay, but--"
25:41;25:43;"Okay, when I hear the whole thing in context,"
25:43;25:45;"he's kind of going off some deep ends."
25:45;25:46;"I'm saying--"
25:46;25:47;"Oh, I thought it was--"
25:47;25:50;"But on a very basic level, 1969, when I think about--"
25:50;25:51;"Oh, beast, man."
25:51;25:54;"Yeah, he got vibey, but I just feel like in the '90s,"
25:54;25:57;"there was so--you know, late-night talk show hosts could--"
25:57;26:00;"whoever they used to make fun of, like Ricky Lake or whatever,"
26:00;26:03;"in the '90s, people were allowed to just make fun of people being fat all the time."
26:03;26:04;"Yeah."
26:04;26:07;"People--I don't know, Kirstie, Kirstie Alley, Oprah, that was a thing."
26:07;26:08;"Delta Burke."
26:08;26:09;"Delta Burke, yep."
26:09;26:12;"So there was so much, like, men talking about women being fat"
26:12;26:14;"and to a lesser extent talking about men being fat."
26:14;26:17;"And nobody ever really questioning the joke."
26:17;26:20;"Whereas now you see, like, there's a more serious conversation about it."
26:20;26:21;"It's like, what's the problem?"
26:21;26:24;"But I'm just saying, 1969, he didn't just say, ""Leave me alone, man."""
26:24;26:27;"He literally--he paused for a second and just said,"
26:27;26:29;"""What's everybody's f---ing problem with this?"
26:29;26:31;"Like, what's so wrong with being fat?"
26:31;26:33;"Why is this notable?"""
26:33;26:36;"And then he kind of tried to turn it into this, you know, thing,"
26:36;26:37;"""I feel powerful."""
26:37;26:39;"But just the fact that he started it that way,"
26:39;26:41;"didn't that strike you as, like, a little ahead of his time?"
26:41;26:42;"Oh, totally."
26:42;26:45;"I just feel like somebody else might have been just on some, like,"
26:45;26:46;"""You know what, man? Leave me alone."""
26:46;26:49;"But he just really paused and was like, ""Let's examine what's happening here."
26:49;26:52;"You find it so notable that I've gained some weight."
26:52;26:53;"Who cares?"
26:53;26:56;"What is this obsession with--why is it so bad to be fat?"""
26:56;26:59;"And I just don't know. 1969, a little bit ahead of his time."

27:57;28:01;"I don't think immediately people went up to Jim Morrison and were just like, ""Thank you."""

28:16;28:17;"Eminem. Couldn't you see that?"
28:17;28:19;"Well, I know he struggled with his weight. He's talked about it."
28:19;28:23;"Right. There's that story that he was at a McDonald's or something,"
28:23;28:25;"and people were like--he could overhear the table next to him being like,"
28:25;28:27;"""Yo, is that Eminem? Yo, is that him?"""
28:27;28:29;"He said, ""No, he's too big. He's too fat."""

28:33;28:35;"But what if he was just like--just got all Morrison on it?"
28:35;28:37;"But you know what? Actually, when I think about it,"
28:37;28:41;"when Kanye was kind of in the news a lot--I guess he still is--"
28:41;28:45;"of course this got overshadowed by the far more controversial--"
28:45;28:46;"Trump stuff?"
28:46;28:49;"Well, remember he went on TMZ, and--"
28:49;28:50;"Right, right, right."
28:50;28:54;"--the big takeaway was that he said this ""absurd slavery is a choice"" thing,"
28:54;28:56;"which he was widely denounced for."
28:56;29:01;"But also, I think, in the same interview--so obviously that's a pretty nutty thing to say."
29:01;29:05;"But within that same interview, he also said something where he was talking about"
29:05;29:11;"the ways in which his life has been compromised by the cruelty of the public"
29:11;29:13;"or the world or the press or something, right?"
29:13;29:16;"And one of the things he said was that it kind of went by quickly."
29:16;29:18;"He said, ""Yeah, because I had to go get liposuction"
29:18;29:21;"because I didn't want to be made fun of the way you guys did Rob Kardashian,"
29:21;29:22;"who's his brother-in-law."""
29:22;29:26;"Which, again, people--so much of the conversation around this was,"
29:26;29:27;"""Oh, crazy Kanye."""
29:27;29:31;"But nobody paused for a second to say, you know, if you gave him the benefit of the doubt."
29:31;29:36;"You're like, ""This is a dude who's a man who is publicly admitting."""
29:36;29:43;"Even in these supposedly woke times, I've watched a family member suffer so much"
29:43;29:46;"because of how people talked about his appearance and his weight"
29:46;29:49;"that I myself was terrified of what people might say about me."
29:49;29:53;"And I'm supposedly this very confident guy, Kanye, famously confident,"
29:53;29:57;"and I went and got surgery not because it made me feel good."
29:57;30:00;"You know, it would be one thing if Kanye said, you know, you could say plastic surgery"
30:00;30:03;"makes some people feel good if that's their choice, but he didn't say it that way."
30:03;30:08;"He said, ""I had to go do this because I was so scared of, like, the cruelty"
30:08;30:09;"that might be enacted upon me."""
30:09;30:12;"Do you think he was referring to social media?"
30:12;30:15;"I'm sure that's part of life being like, ""Yo, dude, like, I'm worried about you."
30:15;30:16;"You should--"""
30:16;30:18;"I remember there were some pictures that came out."
30:18;30:21;"That'd be pretty dark of just Kim."
30:21;30:22;"Yeah."
30:22;30:23;"I don't know."
30:23;30:26;"The way he was talking, he used the word ""y'all,"" and he was gesturing to TMZ,"
30:26;30:29;"representative of the spectacle, the public, the press."
30:29;30:31;"Like, crappy gossip media."
30:31;30:33;"Seinfeld, what were you saying?"
30:33;30:38;"Oh, just how a few months before that, some pictures of him looking bigger"
30:38;30:42;"than we'd ever seen him came out, and it was like a day of Twitter bashing him too."
30:42;30:43;"I remember that."
30:43;30:44;"Bummer."
30:44;30:47;"Nobody wants to be made fun of, and that's such a low blow that people do."
30:47;30:53;"So anyway, my larger point here is just that if in 2018, Kanye, a rock star of our generation--"
30:53;30:56;"I'm saying all this while I'm still chewing my pizza--"
30:56;31:00;"is getting surgery, not because that's exactly what he wants to do,"
31:00;31:04;"but because he's so terrified of the societal pressure that being fat"
31:04;31:07;"is associated with being a bad person, whatever,"
31:07;31:10;"then Jim Morrison was really ahead of his time in 1969 to say this."
31:10;31:12;"I also just like his calm demeanor."
31:12;31:14;"I want to play the beginning again."
31:14;31:17;"You put on a lot of weight eating a lot."
31:17;31:22;"Well, um..."
31:22;31:23;"Well..."
31:23;31:28;"You know, that's something that really bothers me."
31:28;31:31;"What's wrong with being fat?"
31:31;31:33;"That's what I want to know. Why is there such--"
31:33;31:35;"I didn't say there was anything wrong with it."
31:35;31:39;"Why is it so onerous to be fat?"
31:39;31:40;"Um..."
31:40;31:42;"I love his speaking voice."
31:42;31:44;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
31:44;31:45;"Maybe Jim Morrison--"
31:45;31:47;"I don't see anything wrong with fat."
31:47;31:50;"I also just feel like it's just interesting to me."
31:50;31:55;"It's like the '60s were also this time when people were at least partially waking up to certain injustices."
31:55;31:56;"Yeah."
31:56;31:58;"Racism, Vietnam War, sexism."
31:58;32:02;"And you could just feel like at that time, I'm sure, already,"
32:02;32:07;"you know, fat shaming for a lot of activist types is probably so low down the priority list."
32:07;32:08;"Sure."
32:08;32:09;"I don't think it is anymore."
32:09;32:11;"People tend to look at this stuff more holistically."
32:11;32:14;"But in 1969, I just think for him to--"
32:14;32:17;"I just think it's cool for him to pause and just be like,"
32:17;32:19;"""Yeah, what's wrong with being fat?"""
32:19;32:20;"Jake, you're an artist."
32:20;32:25;"Hundreds of years ago, wasn't being overweight kind of a status symbol?"
32:25;32:27;"You see all these Elizabethan--"
32:27;32:28;"Yeah, I've heard that."
32:28;32:30;"Yeah, you see those portraits from like the 18th century."
32:30;32:32;"People looking thick."
32:32;32:40;"The ideal of female beauty then was, by today's standards, plump, for sure."
32:40;32:45;"People are always going to suffer as long as there is an ideal of beauty, man."
32:45;32:52;"I wonder how closely related to like economic status this stuff is."
32:52;32:54;"Because if you're thinking about 18th century paintings,"
32:54;33:00;"it's sort of like the people that were really thin were probably like starving peasants, serfs,"
33:00;33:07;"plebeians, and the people that were like rich that had idle time and extra food,"
33:07;33:12;"like they showed it with their bodies and it was like, ""Oh, that's beautiful."""
33:12;33:14;"It's like that's stable and affluent."
33:14;33:19;"I wonder if there's like a reverse engineering that's happening now."
33:19;33:23;"It's the same thing people say about suntans, that that has gone back and forth"
33:23;33:29;"because there would have been a historical moment when to be an aristocrat meant you didn't have to go outside."
33:29;33:30;"Right, you were pale. Yeah."
33:30;33:32;"So you could be pale, whereas--"
33:32;33:33;"Working folk."
33:33;33:35;"Out here in the fields, we fight for our meals."
33:35;33:38;"If you were working in the sun all day, you'd be tan."
33:38;33:39;"Nice Baba reference."
33:39;33:41;"Thank you."
33:41;33:46;"And then people say, well, eventually that standard shifted when--"
33:46;33:49;"sometimes people associate it with like Coco Chanel"
33:49;33:54;"and saying that when certain kind of high status people might come back from the beach,"
33:54;33:57;"then suddenly it's like, ""Oh, damn, you can get a tan."""
33:57;34:00;"Maybe it's actually better than lazing around in the house."
34:00;34:04;"Lazing around at the beach and getting a tan is even more nice."
34:04;34:08;"And increasingly, the working stiffs of the world were indoors."
34:08;34:09;"Exactly. You're right."
34:09;34:14;"They were going from the toiling in the fields to toiling in factories"
34:14;34:18;"with only the flicker of one of Mr. Edison's new bulbs."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah, things come and go."
34:19;34:22;"This has like a Ken Burns doc feel to it."
34:22;34:24;"You could explore--"
34:24;34:25;"History of--"
34:25;34:28;"Adam Curtis and Ken Burns team up for the first time."
34:28;34:30;"For a doc about fat shaming."
34:30;34:35;"History of image-- self-image and fashion as a--"
34:35;34:37;"this is so time crisis, so half-baked."
34:37;34:38;"Right."
34:38;34:39;"Who's doing the voiceover?"
34:39;34:41;"Because doesn't Ken Burns do the voiceover in his--"
34:41;34:42;"No, no, no. Eminem does it."
34:42;34:44;"Ken Burns does it. Oh, Eminem."
34:44;34:45;"Oh, that'd be cool."
34:45;34:49;"I do think that there's-- because women are so, so shamed,"
34:49;34:56;"understandably there's a little less conversation about the kind of crazy body image stuff that men have as well."
34:56;35:02;"And I don't know, the fact that rock stars from Jim Morrison and Kanye have been sweating it,"
35:02;35:06;"I mean, I got to scale partially because I wanted to have some sense of how much I weighed."
35:06;35:09;"Because like I was saying, I was at my max weight in college."
35:09;35:14;"I more or less stay in a range, but I do feel like I do look very different in pictures."
35:14;35:17;"That's partially why I hate taking pictures."
35:17;35:20;"You know, just sometimes you feel more ready to take a picture and sometimes you don't."
35:20;35:24;"Do you mean like rando fans of the band are like, ""Hey, can I get a picture?"""
35:24;35:28;"Or do you mean like even like if you're just hanging with like friends and family and someone's like,"
35:28;35:33;"""Hey, Thanksgiving, let's take a picture."" And you're just like, ""What's wrong with being fat?"""
35:33;35:39;"No, I'm talking more like when I have to take-- when I know that I have to go do press or something."
35:39;35:41;"And I haven't done very much over the past five years."
35:41;35:48;"But just like knowing, like I've definitely had the experience of just kind of like living my life and eating how I want."
35:48;35:53;"And then being like, ""Oh, by the way, they want to do like a photo shoot in two days."""
35:53;35:57;"And just like have this slight flicker of anxiety in my head, just like a mind fighting shape."
35:57;36:02;"And, you know, if I was like really woke, I wouldn't-- I'd be like, ""Well, this is how I look right now in this moment."""
36:02;36:06;"And take a picture. And that's one way I look. And, you know, if I--"
36:06;36:08;"Grow a beard, dude. Go full Morrison."
36:08;36:10;"I know. I can't grow enough of a beard. That helps."
36:10;36:15;"You know the day destroys the night. Night divides the day."
36:15;36:27;"Try to run, try to hide. Break on through to the other side. Break on through to the other side. Break on through to the other side, yeah."
36:27;36:36;"We chased our pleasures here. Dug our treasures there."
36:36;36:45;"Can you still recall the time we cried? Break on through to the other side. Break on through to the other side."
36:45;36:48;"You know who I could see kind of being Morrison style?"
36:48;36:49;"Who? Besides Eminem?"
36:49;36:51;"Father John Misty."
36:51;36:52;"Oh, yeah. Father John Misty."
36:52;36:54;"He kind of has that vibe. Like he-- I mean--"
36:54;36:55;"Well, he's a very slim man."
36:55;36:59;"I know, but he has a-- like Jim Morrison's demeanor in that interview."
36:59;37:00;"And they look kind of similar, too."
37:00;37:05;"Kind of reminded me of FJM. But if he put on a bunch of pounds and then someone was like,"
37:05;37:07;"""So, what's that guy's name?"""
37:07;37:08;"Father John?"
37:08;37:09;"Yeah. Oh, Josh."
37:09;37:10;"So Josh."
37:10;37:17;"So, Mr. Tillman, it seems like you put on a few. What's wrong with really slow, deliberate delivery?"
37:17;37:18;"I also love the fact that he starts off--"
37:18;37:19;"What's wrong with it?"
37:19;37:25;"I think also the one thing that also gets me is that he pauses and says, ""You know, this is something that really bothers me."""
37:25;37:30;"He's really taking a stand here. He's not just being like, ""Oh, you know, man, I don't like that question."""
37:30;37:32;"He really pauses. He deliberates and says--"
37:32;37:34;"He's not nervous. He's not panicked."
37:34;37:39;"""This question that you just asked me, I've thought about it before. It bothers me on a fundamental level."""
37:39;37:42;"And he doesn't-- yeah, because he doesn't make it personal. That's what's interesting."
37:42;37:45;"He doesn't say like, ""What's your problem, man? Leave me alone."""
37:45;37:46;"That's what Eminem would do."
37:46;37:48;"Yeah. ""Now you call me fat?"""
37:48;37:51;"Jim Morrison is actually like pauses and thinks about the world for a second."
37:51;37:52;"Wow."
37:52;37:53;"""This really bothers me."""
37:53;37:58;"I got to say, I'm picturing myself this weekend going down a Jim Morrison interview--"
37:58;37:59;"Interview hole."
37:59;38:01;"--YouTube. Did you watch others?"
38:01;38:03;"No. I think this one just popped up."
38:03;38:06;"I had kind of a breakthrough just right now of like--"
38:06;38:07;"Yeah, that he's kind of cool."
38:07;38:10;"--Oh, Jim Morrison was cool. It's easy to like bag on the doors."
38:10;38:14;"Because people kind of talk about Jim Morrison like-- basically like he was a goofball."
38:14;38:17;"Or he's like a pretentious, kind of not very talented poet or something."
38:17;38:22;"Right. I feel like for a while there was kind of-- if you think about some of the icons of the '60s,"
38:22;38:27;"they'd be like, ""Now John Lennon was smart. He knew how the world worked. Jim Morrison was probably off."""
38:27;38:29;"And I'm kind of like, ""I never heard of John Lennon."""
38:29;38:32;"I'm sure John Lennon took a stand on other things, but I'm like, ""I don't know. Just the 1960s."""
38:32;38:35;"John Lennon just wrote better songs. That's why we love him more."
38:35;38:39;"The crystal ship is being filled."
38:39;38:40;"I mean, the doors have--"
38:40;38:41;"They have some good ones."
38:41;38:43;"They had quite a run."
38:43;38:46;"Yeah. He really started an archetype too, Morrison."
38:46;38:51;"Yeah, there is something when you hear his speaking voice, it makes you like pause and be like,"
38:51;38:52;"""There's more to this guy for sure."""
38:52;38:54;"So how do we get down this rabbit hole?"
38:54;38:56;"Are we talking about my brother's wedding presentation?"
38:56;38:59;"Yeah, no, no, because you were talking about how you guys were total bean poles."
38:59;39:00;"Right."
39:00;39:05;"So the idea of Dave portaging a canoe, just a 12-year-old bean pole,"
39:05;39:07;"showed you that he had some grit."
39:07;39:08;"Yep, told that story."
39:08;39:15;"And then the determination that was on display was shortly thereafter put into music."
39:15;39:16;"You quoted the dead."
39:16;39:17;"I did."
39:17;39:18;"And I've been thinking about that because--"
39:18;39:22;"I saw Dave's face when I was like, ""And you know what? I'll just quote the great Jerry Garcia."""
39:22;39:24;"And I was just being like, ""Oh my God."""
39:24;39:29;"But then I said, ""They love each other. Lord, you can see that it's true."""
39:29;39:34;"They love each other. Lord, you can see that it's true."
39:34;39:36;"I think that's such a nice sentiment."
39:36;39:39;"I do think that there is--I can only think of a couple songs."
39:39;39:43;"They love each other, which was a Jerry solo song originally, right?"
39:43;39:44;"Yeah."
39:44;39:45;"That the dead played a lot."
39:45;39:47;"And there's a couple kink songs."
39:47;39:49;"Oh, and also there's like a zombie song."
39:49;39:50;"What's a zombie song?"
39:50;39:51;"Basically what I'm--"
39:51;39:52;"Like the classic wedding one?"
39:52;39:54;"This will be our year."
39:54;39:55;"No, not even that one."
39:55;39:57;"I'm basically thinking about songs that are--"
39:57;40:00;"And I've been thinking about this a lot, even in my own life."
40:00;40:02;"Songs that are about other people--"
40:02;40:04;"Observing people in love?"
40:04;40:11;"Yeah, basically observing people in love and how so much of our society, our society, man,"
40:11;40:16;"tells us that all of life is about finding love."
40:16;40:23;"And that most songs are about the singer looking for love, experiencing love, experiencing heartbreak."
40:23;40:24;"Right."
40:24;40:27;"And that occupies a very, very high percentage of all songs ever written."
40:27;40:29;"It's all first-person narrative."
40:29;40:30;"Yeah."
40:30;40:35;"Or if there is a story, a song that's about people in love, it's just kind of telling the story of their love."
40:35;40:41;"It's not that triangulation of being like, ""I'm a person here, and watching other people in love gives me positive feelings too."
40:41;40:42;"It's nice to know that other people in love--"""
40:42;40:45;"And I was thinking about that, that it's just weird that there's not more about--"
40:45;40:51;"Yeah, very specific experience of observing people close to you, and they're giving off great vibes."
40:51;40:54;"Which is a part of--definitely a part of a wedding."
40:54;40:55;"Okay, what's the--"
40:55;40:58;"Lord, you know they made a fine connection."
40:58;41:00;"They love each other."
41:00;41:01;"Oh, yeah."
41:01;41:02;"Track 11 on Odyssey and Oracle."
41:02;41:03;"Great album."
41:03;41:05;"Famous Zombies album."
41:05;41:07;"I think this is it, ""Friends of Mine."""
41:07;41:08;"Oh, yeah."
41:10;41:11;"The same--"
41:19;41:21;"Very straightforward."
41:37;41:39;"Oh, yeah, and they're just listing the friends."
41:39;41:41;"Just listing couples."
41:48;41:50;"All one-syllable names."
41:50;41:52;"Those backup vocals are amazing."
41:55;41:57;"Jake and Han."
41:57;41:58;"Yeah."
41:58;42:00;"They'd shorten it to Jake and Han."
42:00;42:02;"Dave and T."
42:02;42:04;"I think there's some double ones."
42:16;42:18;"Molly. Paul and Molly."
42:29;42:35;"[laughs]"
42:35;42:40;"Also, just tearing into a guitar solo about how much other people love each other"
42:40;42:42;"is just not a common sentiment."
43:11;43:12;"[laughs]"
43:12;43:14;"Celebrity couples."
43:21;43:23;"What an ending."
43:23;43:25;"Jim and Christy."
43:25;43:26;"Ah."
43:26;43:29;"I especially love--I haven't heard that song in a long time."
43:29;43:30;"That sounded amazing."
43:30;43:32;"I also love that the song gets so pumped up."
43:32;43:33;"It's kind of a barn burner."
43:33;43:34;"It really is."
43:34;43:38;"It'd be like one thing to sit down at a piano, write a pretty ballad about witnessing the love of my friends."
43:38;43:39;"Right, right."
43:39;43:40;"Makes me think about--"
43:40;43:43;"Also, I love that there's almost nothing that ties it back to the speaker."
43:43;43:46;"All it says is, ""It feels good to know two people so in love."""
43:46;43:48;"And also, I just love that it's energetic."
43:48;43:49;"Yeah."
43:49;43:51;"It feels so good."
43:51;43:54;"So in love."
43:54;43:56;"They are friends of mine."
43:56;44:02;"Just imagine a pop song anywhere near--I mean, I don't think this was a big song."
44:02;44:04;"The deep cut on the record."
44:04;44:05;"It's a deep cut."
44:05;44:07;"The Zombies were a big band at the time."
44:07;44:10;"Imagine somebody--like a big hit song that's just about other people and love."
44:10;44:11;"It just doesn't exist."
44:11;44:14;"Everything's kind of about--we're the me generation."
44:14;44:15;"Wow, man."
44:15;44:17;"Maybe that's a problem with our society, man."
44:17;44:21;"There's not enough emphasis on other people's love."
44:21;44:24;"In fact, we live in very bitter times, man."
44:24;44:27;"You see other people in love, these days you're more likely to be [bleep] them."
44:27;44:31;"I want you to go full Jim Morrison on your press tour when your album comes out."
44:31;44:32;"I don't even know what I mean by that."
44:32;44:33;"Right."
44:33;44:34;"Well, one thing I definitely learned from him--"
44:34;44:36;"Just take really long--"
44:36;44:37;"No, I've always thought about that."
44:37;44:42;"I have this issue generally where if I don't feel totally comfortable--"
44:42;44:44;"I mean, this is totally not unique to me."
44:44;44:45;"I think a lot of people are like this."
44:45;44:48;"If I don't feel totally comfortable, I'll just fill in all the space."
44:48;44:49;"A lot of people are like that."
44:49;44:50;"Oh, sure."
44:50;44:53;"You're having a weird conversation with somebody and they seem kind of weird."
44:53;44:55;"You'll just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."
44:55;45:01;"It's very easy to do that with interviewers because partially that's what they want you to do."
45:01;45:02;"Yeah, they're banking on it."
45:02;45:05;"They'd rather let you run your mouth until you say something kind of--"
45:05;45:08;"I don't even want to say juicy because it's not like every interviewer is out to get you,"
45:08;45:12;"but they are incentivized to at least get good nuggets."
45:12;45:13;"Sure."
45:13;45:14;"A lot of their questions are kind of vague."
45:14;45:16;"So if they're like, ""What's your approach to songwriting?"""
45:16;45:20;"And if everything you say is kind of like, ""Well, when I think about songs""--"
45:20;45:24;"They want that little nugget where you're just like, ""Chainsmokers suck."
45:24;45:25;"That's what I think about."""
45:25;45:27;"They're waiting for you to get to that point."
45:27;45:33;"Then I also feel like because I often will add all these little sentence fragments to really try to make my point"
45:33;45:36;"because in real time I'll be like, ""But having said that, I do understand where they're coming from,"""
45:36;45:37;"and blah, blah, blah."
45:37;45:39;"I just end up with these crazy run-on sentences."
45:39;45:41;"So maybe one thing I can learn from this is the pause."
45:41;45:45;"Just every time somebody asks me anything--"
45:45;45:46;"Do like the big inhale."
45:46;45:47;"Yeah."
45:47;45:49;"""So you took five years to make this album."
45:49;45:53;"What have you been up to?"""
45:53;45:56;"You know, that's something that really bothers me,"
45:56;46:01;"this idea that five years is a long time and that I would have been doing things."
46:01;46:04;"What's wrong with doing nothing for five years?"
46:04;46:06;"I didn't say there's anything wrong."
46:06;46:09;"""Our society has preoccupation with productivity."""
46:09;46:11;"Why is it--this actually could be good."
46:11;46:17;"Why is it so onerous to not produce content for the capitalist enterprise?"
46:17;46:22;"When I was doing little to nothing, I felt like a tank."
46:22;46:26;"I felt powerful as I would walk to Coffee Bean."
46:26;46:28;"I felt like a tank."
46:28;46:29;"I don't know."
46:29;46:30;"I forgot what it does."
46:30;46:33;"I just--always pause."
46:33;46:35;"What were the influences on this album?"
46:35;46:37;"Just like the most part--"
46:37;46:42;"What were you listening to when you made this album?"
46:42;46:45;"That's something that really bothers me,"
46:45;46:50;"the idea that you need to listen to music to make music."
46:50;46:52;"What's wrong with not listening to music?"
46:52;46:53;"We'll see."
46:58;47:02;"Riders on the storm"
47:02;47:07;"Into this house we're born"
47:07;47:11;"Into this world we're thrown"
47:11;47:16;"Like a dog without a bone and actor out of love"
47:16;47:20;"Riders on the storm"
47:20;47:25;"There's a killer on the road"
47:25;47:30;"His brain is squirming like a toad"
47:30;47:35;"Take a long holiday"
47:35;47:39;"Let your children play"
47:39;47:42;"If you give this man a ride"
47:42;47:45;"Sweet family will die"
47:45;47:48;"Killer on the road"
47:48;47:50;"Yeah"
47:50;47:56;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
47:56;47:59;"Should we talk about this Paul McCartney album?"
47:59;48:01;"So in love."
48:01;48:02;"Because I've been interested in this."
48:02;48:03;"Yeah, we should."
48:03;48:06;"First of all, I've got to say, I'm a Paul McCartney fan."
48:06;48:07;"Who the hell isn't?"
48:07;48:09;"I've got to say, though, is Jake--"
48:09;48:10;"Yeah."
48:10;48:12;"Did you check out the whole album?"
48:12;48:13;"No."
48:13;48:16;"Because you texted me that you had a very bad reaction to one of the singles."
48:16;48:19;"I heard the single on--I don't know what it was."
48:19;48:21;"Oh, it might have been on Beatles radio."
48:21;48:25;"And there was a new Paul McCartney song called ""Fuh You."""
48:25;48:29;"Well, first of all, I love Paul McCartney's press tour that he's been doing."
48:29;48:31;"He's been kind of just speaking his mind."
48:31;48:32;"He--"
48:32;48:33;"Oh, my God."
48:33;48:35;"He kind of broke the internet for a second."
48:35;48:36;"Yeah."
48:36;48:38;"This is classic three weeks too late Time Crisis."
48:38;48:39;"Oh, yeah."
48:39;48:45;"He broke the internet for a second telling a story about how when he and John Lennon were lads,"
48:45;48:48;"they and a group of boys masturbated together."
48:48;48:49;"Not unheard of."
48:49;48:50;"I never did that."
48:50;48:52;"And I was never even near it."
48:52;48:54;"But that's the type of thing that when I was a lad--"
48:54;48:55;"Oh, yeah."
48:55;48:58;"--in Liverpool, you didn't tend to come across this type of activity,"
48:58;49:03;"but you would hear so much dumb discussion about these sex moves that don't exist."
49:03;49:04;"Yeah."
49:04;49:06;"I feel like that probably happened also way more back in their day."
49:06;49:07;"Less to do."
49:07;49:10;"Yeah, there was less to do in the--I guess even in the '50s."
49:10;49:12;"Yeah, late '50s."
49:12;49:15;"Well, so anyway, Paul McCartney told this story and people were--"
49:15;49:19;"I could tell from what I read the way he told it was telling it was like,"
49:19;49:22;"""Oh, it's just funny, like a bunch of kids exploring their sexuality."""
49:22;49:28;"And he said one of the funny things about it is that people would call out the names of famous actresses."
49:28;49:29;"Right."
49:29;49:30;"Oh, Brigitte Bardot."
49:30;49:31;"Brigitte Bardot."
49:31;49:33;"And then John, being a cut-up, would call out Winston Churchill."
49:33;49:35;"John with that ironic sense of humor."
49:35;49:40;"And also, John, why couldn't--what if somebody within the crew found Winston Churchill attractive?"
49:40;49:42;"You're no Jim Morrison, John Lennon."
49:42;49:45;"Yeah, you know what, John? He steered us through our darkest hour."
49:45;49:47;"If that's not sexually attractive, I don't know what is."
49:47;49:51;"Anyway, the point is that Paul told this story and everybody got obsessed with it"
49:51;49:55;"to the point that the next day after the story broke,"
49:55;50:00;"the New York Post dropped one of their best covers of all time, which was ""Beat the Beatles."""
50:00;50:05;"And I'm sure everybody's familiar that the New York Post famously does punny wordplay headlines on their front cover."
50:05;50:09;"And the Beatles' first album in America, at least, was called ""Meet the Beatles."""
50:09;50:11;"So that's an iconic phrase associated with the Beatles."
50:11;50:14;"So anyway, it's cool. Paul's out there doing his thing."
50:14;50:16;"But Jake, and from what I've seen--"
50:16;50:18;"Paul said that tucked away for 55 years."
50:18;50:21;"Apparently he'd told the story before, just pre-Internet era,"
50:21;50:23;"so it hadn't gotten picked up on in the same way."
50:23;50:30;"So I've been happy to see that Paul recently got his first number one since 1982, his first number one album."
50:30;50:31;"That's amazing."
50:31;50:33;"So, you know, well-deserved."
50:33;50:36;"And it's cool he's out there speaking his mind, showing people another side of Paul McCartney."
50:36;50:39;"And from what I've seen, the reviews have been great. I haven't heard the record yet, but--"
50:39;50:41;"""Egypt Station."""
50:41;50:42;"The album's called ""Egypt Station."""
50:42;50:43;"Intriguing title."
50:43;50:44;"It's definitely."
50:44;50:47;"But before I saw that this record was getting really positive attention,"
50:47;50:54;"I was a little nervous because Jake hit me up saying, ""I heard this new Paul song, 'Fuck You,' and I don't like it."""
50:54;50:56;"I think it was through the Time Crisis text thread."
50:56;50:58;"You're like, ""Guys, this is rough stuff."""

59:02;59:03;"who've appeared in the documentary,"
59:03;59:06;"the Vietnamese people, the Americans, whatever,"
59:06;59:09;"then they just kind of like rip into this,"
59:09;59:10;"and it's actually like really moving,"
59:10;59:12;"'cause this is one of those songs that's like,"
59:12;59:13;"you hear it as a kid, and you're like,"
59:13;59:14;"""This is a beautiful song,"""
59:14;59:17;"and then you get older, and it becomes a little trite."
59:17;59:18;"'Cause you just hear it too much."
59:18;59:20;"And then you see it in the context of like--"
59:20;59:21;"- You're like, ""Yeah, okay, let it be."
59:21;59:23;"""That's cool. You're trippy."""
59:23;59:24;"- Yeah, what does that even mean?"
59:24;59:26;"And then you see it in the context of like the final song"
59:26;59:29;"of like the Vietnam doc that's just like so brutal."
59:29;59:31;"- Wow. - It's really moving."
59:31;59:33;"- Wow. - When this drops in."
59:33;59:35;"- God, I love that you watch the whole thing."
59:35;59:36;"I want to do it."
59:36;59:38;"- Yeah, I had some time on my hands"
59:38;59:40;"for those long flights."
59:40;59:44;"- Over some like--you know, like the last week of the year,"
59:44;59:45;"like Christmas and New Year's,"
59:45;59:47;"just like not much going on."
59:47;59:50;"- Just block out 18 hours."
59:50;59:53;"- ♪ Let it be ♪"
59:53;59:55;"- So in the context of the doc,"
59:55;59:57;"you're just sort of like, ""Yeah, man."""
59:57;59:59;"- Yeah, you're like, ""Let it be, man."""
59:59;01:00:00;"- Like, seriously."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"- A lot of crazy, terrible things went down."
01:00:03;01:00:06;"- Yeah."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Yeah, and then the lyrics become--"
01:00:08;01:00:12;"Yeah, the lyrics become much more moving in that context."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"Anyway, Ken Burns, Vietnam doc, check it out."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Should we do the top five?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- It's time for the top five--"
01:00:19;01:00:23;"f-f-f-f-f-five on iTunes."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- So this week on the top five,"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"we're gonna compare the greatest hits of this week in 2018"
01:00:29;01:00:32;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1982."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"Why 1982?"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"- Paul McCartney's ""Egypt Station"""
01:00:36;01:00:38;"is his first number one record."
01:00:38;01:00:39;"- Since?"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- 1982's ""Tug of War."""
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- Yep."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"- Which was also a number one record."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"- And this is considered the longest--"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"or it is the longest gap between number ones"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"for a living artist ever--"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"36 years, three months, and ten days."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Shout-out to Paul, still doing his thing."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"- Mm-hmm."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"- So I'm gonna take it back to '82."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"- All right."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"- I wasn't alive. You were, Jake."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- The days between."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"[laughter]"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"- 1977 to 1984 are truly the days between."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- In the TC-verse."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"What was going on in '82 with you?"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"- Let's see, I would've been five,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"holding it down pretty solid in Southbury."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"- Is that the year Dave was born?"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"- He's born in December of '81."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"- So this was kind of your first full year"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"with the little brother."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"- Yeah, he would've been--"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"what are we in here, September?"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"Yeah, so he would've been almost a year at this point."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"- Do you have memories of Dave being born?"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Yeah."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"I remember the anticipation."
01:01:32;01:01:37;"I remember not knowing whether it would be a brother or a sister."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- Oh, 'cause your parents didn't know?"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"- I guess they didn't know."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"- Whoa."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"- I don't know if that was by choice"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"or if in '81 that wasn't as much a thing."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"- You know, recently I watched a bunch of YouTube videos"
01:01:46;01:01:49;"'cause I've been seeing so many gender reveal videos."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Are you familiar with this concept?"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"- Not really, but I think I picked up on it."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"People being like,"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"finding out what the gender of their baby's gonna be."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- Yeah, and it kind of started--"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"maybe people have been doing this forever,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"but now similar to promposals."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"Do you know what promposals are?"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"- No, but again, I'm making the logical jump."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"Like, these are YouTube videos you're talking about."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- Yeah. - And they're just like,"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"""Hey, gang!"" - Or Instagram."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- Okay. - But it's just like,"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"people kind of started upping the ante with certain things"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"when they knew that it could go viral."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"So if back in the day a gender reveal"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"might just be somebody making a cake,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"and generally speaking, with gender reveals,"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"they kind of adhere to a very strict gender color scheme,"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"which is blue for boys and pink for girls,"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"which, you know, I thought we were getting rid of in 2018,"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"but perhaps not."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"- But are you literally seeing the moment when they find out?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Like, the split second?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- Yes, well, probably for one of the parents."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"It seems like it's very centered around the dad finding out,"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"from what I've seen."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"- Dad's checked out, man."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"- Yeah, dad's checked out. - Mom knows."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- Mom knows."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Yeah, I guess the dad didn't even go with her"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"to the OB-GYN appointment."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"But so I've seen ones--"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"like, let's say that the dad"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"is a professional baseball player."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Well, how about this?"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"We gather the friends and family around the backyard,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"we'll pitch the dad a ball,"
01:03:03;01:03:07;"and when he smacks into it, dust will fly out"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"that's either blue or pink,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"revealing the gender in a way that speaks"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"to the dad's profession--baseball."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"- Wow, that is elaborate."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"- So there's kind of everything you could think of."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"- Right."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"- So, like, you could go down to Rabbit Hole"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"and just watch, like, ""Best Gender Reveals,"""
01:03:25;01:03:27;"and just watch--take down, like, 200 of them."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"- Are there any ""Grateful Dead""-themed gender reveals?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- What would that one even be?"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"You, like, close your eyes,"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"and they, like, play a ""Grateful Dead"" song,"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"and either it's--"
01:03:35;01:03:38;"- If it's from '72, it's a boy."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"If it's from '77, it's a girl."
01:03:39;01:03:42;"- If it's Jack Straw, it's a boy."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"If it's Ramblin' Rose..."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- Yeah, if it's Stella Blue..."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"- Yeah."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"- Oh, that's confusing. If it's Stella Blue..."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- Oh, right. How about this?"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"If it's from the era where Donna performed with them,"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"it's a girl. - Nice."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"- If it's from before or after, it's a boy."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"- Yep."
01:03:57;01:04:01;"- So you might have to take down a solid 30-minute--"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- Without knowing."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Yeah."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"We're gonna start you at minute 15"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"of the 45-minute playing in the band."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"Or if you're, like, a true Deadhead,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"you'd be like, ""Easy, that's '73."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"""Donna was a member. It's a girl. Nice."""
01:04:13;01:04:14;"But whatever, this is--this is--"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"- Nice."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- This is a thing people do."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- Gotcha."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"- You know what? Like, maybe if I was doing--"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"planning a gender reveal party for you, Jake,"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"'cause you're a painter. - Yeah."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"- I might gather your friends and family in your art studio."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I would get a blank canvas."
01:04:29;01:04:33;"We'd blindfold you, dip your paintbrush..."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Ooh."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"- In the paint, put on some good tunes for you,"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"and say, ""Jake, I want to take you two minutes"
01:04:39;01:04:42;"""and just follow your instinct as you paint blindfolded."""
01:04:42;01:04:44;"And then we would say, ""All right, man, take it off,"""
01:04:44;01:04:46;"and you would open your eyes to see"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"an impressionistic pink painting,"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"if it's a girl, blue if it's a boy."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"- That sounds really cool."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"- We should do that. - I love that."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"- Very moving."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"- Whether or not you have a kid, we should do that."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"- Very moving."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"- Why was I talking about this?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"- Um, because we're talking about the top."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"- Oh, wait, oh, no, we're talking about when you found out that--"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"- Oh, yeah. - You didn't know if you were gonna have a brother."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"- Right. - So then there's an adjacent category"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"or a interrelated category to gender reveals,"
01:05:11;01:05:16;"which is, like, just people videoing their kids"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"to give the kid a gender reveal."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- Oh, wow. - So this is not, like--"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"- Let 'em know. - This is not daddy gender reveal."
01:05:20;01:05:24;"So I watched one, which the parents deemed to share with the world,"
01:05:24;01:05:27;"where they go up to their little daughter,"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"who looks like four or five, and they say,"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"""Hey, here's a little gift. Remember, you know how Mommy said"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"you were gonna have a brother or sister, right?"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"Coming up soon? Yes? Well, here's a little gift."""
01:05:37;01:05:39;"And then they give her blue balloons"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"and a little pouch with some blue sweets."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"And the girl bursts into tears."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And she's just like, ""No."""
01:05:45;01:05:46;"And they're like, ""Why?"""
01:05:46;01:05:48;"She's like, ""I wanted a sister."""
01:05:48;01:05:50;"""But you're getting a little brother."""
01:05:50;01:05:54;"""But I don't want a brother. I wanted a sister."""
01:05:54;01:05:56;"I remember having that exact same--"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"- That you wanted a sister? - No, a brother."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"- Oh, so you were psyched. - I was relieved"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"when the phone rang at my grandmother's house."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"- You were just like-- - And I was just like--"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- Talk. - ""What did we get?"""
01:06:06;01:06:09;"- ""Give it to me straight."" - ""Give it to me straight."""
01:06:09;01:06:12;"""Did I get a brother? Yes. Yes."""
01:06:12;01:06:15;"I went down on one knee and just fist-pumped."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"I have no memories of when I found out"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"that I was getting a little sister."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"See, that's the thing."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"I think you have slightly more memories at five"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"than you do at four,"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"and when you're closer to my sister."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Right. So you don't remember any of the anticipation"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"around the house or anything?"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"- No, I vaguely remember-- - Like, Mom's pregnant."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"I don't remember Mom being pregnant."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"I remember--I have some vague memory of being like,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"""I'm at Grandma's house for two days"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"because my mom's in the hospital."""
01:06:38;01:06:40;"I remember that there was--"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"this is some old-school sh--. Maybe it's still true."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"My sister was born at a hospital in New Jersey,"
01:06:44;01:06:47;"and I remember that hospital had a McDonald's."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"So I remember being, like, some vague sense of--"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"- Just being like, ""Yes!"" - ""Yes!"""
01:06:51;01:06:52;"All right, where are we?"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"We were gonna count down the top five gender reveals"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"- of 2018. - That was my--"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"That was my situation circa '82."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"That's the year I was born."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"- Oh! - Oh, you were born '82?"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- Yeah. - You seem--"
01:07:02;01:07:05;"Just FYI. Just throwing it out there."
01:07:05;01:07:08;"The year that Seinfeld came into this world."
01:07:08;01:07:11;"Okay, so the number five song in '82"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"was ""Melissa Manchester."""
01:07:13;01:07:15;"""You should hear how she talks about you."""
01:07:15;01:07:17;"That kind of sounds like the song we're talking about,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"where you're talking about other people's love."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Totally."

01:07:23;01:07:25;"According to lyricist Dean Pitchford,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"the song's lyrical concept was borrowed"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"from ""She Loves You"" by the Beatles."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"I guess that's kind of an unusual one."

01:49:42;01:49:45;"So in the music video, Machine Gun Kelly, he's got this weird little bowl"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"that he's rapping while eating."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"That's more relevant than weird industry people that no one's heard of."
01:49:51;01:49:55;"But if you haven't seen the video, it's a little bit like, what are you talking about?"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"# Machine Gun Kelly, you think you're a killer #"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"# Nah, you a b***h like Steve Miller #"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"# F***ing Joker #"

01:50:07;01:50:10;"# Go back to recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago #"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"# What do you know, oops, know your facts before you come at me #"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"That one was pretty bad."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"I also remember thinking at the time, just to respond to somebody saying,"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"""Your last four albums since recovery sucked."""
01:50:19;01:50:22;"""Ha ha, I got you, I only released three that sucked."""

01:50:23;01:50:25;"""Do some f***ing research."""
01:50:25;01:50:26;"That is pretty thin."

01:50:28;01:50:30;"# Yeah, I had enough money in '02 #"

01:50:58;01:51:00;"Wait, let's unpack that one."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"He's saying to him, ""You're not a good rapper."""
01:51:02;01:51:04;"""You've never been on a list of the all-time greats."""
01:51:04;01:51:06;"""You've never been next to, say, a Biggie or a Jay."""
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Whereas I have, and that's true."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Not everybody agrees, but people have put Eminem"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"on lists of the greatest of all time."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"But is he telling Machine Gun Kelly"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"the only list you'd be on is next to Taylor Swift"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"and Iggy Azalea?"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Yes."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"So just a list of, like, random white people?"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"Yeah, I guess, like, soft..."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"Pop stars?"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Pop stars who don't have lyrical skills."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"It's, you know..."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"Taylor Swift, you say what you want."

01:51:56;01:51:58;"I'm sure this is what people have been saying,"
01:51:58;01:52:00;"is that if Eminem's problem lately..."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"And clearly he's still huge to his fans,"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"but it's been that he's not as fired up"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"'cause he doesn't have as much to talk about."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Hmm."
01:52:07;01:52:10;"Well, this beef gave them both something to talk about."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"Lesson learned, Eminem has to be angry"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"at someone to produce his best work."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"# Said my beard is weird #"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"# Being rich-shamed by some prick #"

01:52:33;01:52:35;"# I'll give you a beat for the effort #"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"It also is so-- it just gets exhausting."
01:52:37;01:52:40;"It's also with both of them, it's, like, funny how--"
01:52:40;01:52:43;"I guess on a lot of rap beef, and especially this one,"
01:52:43;01:52:47;"they alternate between the incredibly petty, specific stuff"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"that this shit's really about."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Like, ""You told Paul Rosenberg to do this."""

01:52:52;01:52:54;"""Why would you think I would even talk about you?"""

01:53:05;01:53:07;"Do you think that there's actually"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"any sort of back channel between them?"
01:53:09;01:53:10;"Oh, that's very possible."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"Or their management, and be like, ""Okay."""
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Well, I was reading yesterday--"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"This was hilarious."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"Listen, I'm gonna-- okay, go ahead."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"It's the same producer for both songs."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"Oh, really?"
01:53:18;01:53:19;"It was revealed."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"Oh, but, I mean, people send out beats to everybody."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"So it doesn't mean that they were, like, talking,"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"but who knows?"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"But Ezra, how would you feel if, like,"
01:53:27;01:53:30;"your Steve Miller diss was also produced by Ariel?"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"Wow."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"And then Steve Miller came back at me?"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Yeah, and Ariel also produced that."
01:53:35;01:53:37;"I'd be like, ""Weird move, Ariel."""
01:53:37;01:53:40;"Ariel produced the Steve Miller diss track?"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"I hope it keeps going."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"I want to hear Machine Gun's response."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"We'll see."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"Now you're in."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Where he's like, ""I'm absolutely in."""

01:55:51;01:55:53;"I'm going to go with the elder statesman on this one, Eminem."
01:55:53;01:55:55;"Eminem's more your generation."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"He's more my generation."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"And I notice on the two songs, he has more voices."
01:56:00;01:56:05;"He has more gears he can go to, which I appreciate."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"Would you say Eminem has more lyricism?"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"Oh, absolutely."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"They both have pretty tough tone."
01:56:13;01:56:16;"[laughter]"
01:56:16;01:56:17;"That'd be sick if Eminem--"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"Eminem has more control over his tone, I think."
01:56:20;01:56:24;"What if Eminem just out of nowhere dropped some line about how,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"""I'm Jerry Garcia, you're John Mayer""?"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"That'd be sick."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"That'd be somewhat apropos."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"I'm the real deal."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"Machine Gun Kelly's the John Mayer to Eminem's Jerry,"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"which is not necessarily saying a bad thing."
01:56:37;01:56:38;"No."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Better to be the John Mayer to someone's Jerry Garcia"
01:56:40;01:56:44;"than have nothing to do with Jerry Garcia, I guess."
01:56:44;01:56:48;"Anyway, Steve Miller, you're dead to us."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"We had your back, man."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"Go to hell."
01:56:50;01:56:54;"[laughter]"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"You waiting till Jerry died?"
01:56:56;01:56:59;"Couldn't talk that [bleep] when he was still alive."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"[laughter]"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"Steve Miller really needs to speak on this."
01:57:04;01:57:07;"I would say we should have him call in, but there's no way he will."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"Because he's a coward."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"Yeah."
01:57:09;01:57:10;"I hope this gets back to Steve Miller."
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Let's see if we can reach out."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Wait, does Steve Miller have a Twitter account, Seinfeld?"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"He's on Twitter, yeah."
01:57:15;01:57:17;"He's got 68,000 Twitter followers."
01:57:17;01:57:18;"It's @stevemillerban."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"You think it's him?"
01:57:19;01:57:20;"No, it's someone managing it."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"It's verified."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Yeah, I don't think he's there."
01:57:22;01:57:23;"Okay, but still, if you--"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"I don't want him to come across as aggressive,"
01:57:25;01:57:30;"but if you could just start tweeting @stevemiller's account"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"just a few times a week."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"Sure."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"All caps?"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Yeah, all caps, but keep the language tone down."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"This ain't Punisher Burgers."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"Yeah, this is not Punisher Burgers,"
01:57:40;01:57:45;"but just why did you perform on stage with the Grateful Dead in 1992,"
01:57:45;01:57:48;"and then after Jerry died, say you didn't like them?"
01:57:48;01:57:49;"No problem."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"Why?"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"And just a few times a week, and then eventually--"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"because they can't be getting too many @s."
01:57:55;01:57:58;"Are you seeing a thread of me just saying ""why, why, why,"""
01:57:58;01:58:01;"so it's like a wall of just--because that seems a little--"
01:58:01;01:58:02;"I don't know."
01:58:02;01:58:05;"Yeah, just maybe not all caps, just like, ""Hey, following up,"
01:58:05;01:58:09;"""I'm just curious about why Steve would have jammed with the dead in '92"
01:58:09;01:58:13;"""and then chose to talk s--t about them whenever he did after Jerry died."""
01:58:13;01:58:14;"2008."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Yeah, and then maybe just like, ""Yeah, just out of curiosity,"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"""did he wait until Jerry died to talk that s--t?"""
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Because that's kind of how it seems."
01:58:20;01:58:22;"Look, maybe there is an explanation."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"Maybe Steve will come out and say, ""You know what?"
01:58:24;01:58:25;"""I did jam with them in '92."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"""I was under a lot of pressure to do so."

01:58:44;01:58:46;"All right, another time crisis."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"Peace."
01:58:49;01:58:53;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-beace."
