02:40;02:42;"malaise or or even"
02:43;02:47;"Anxiety about it. You're right. It is because of climate change and"
02:47;02:53;"people increasingly see a hot day, you know, perhaps for good reason as"
02:53;03:00;"Yeah a harbinger of their impending death and everybody else's death. But yeah, maybe that's a little bit extra"
03:00;03:03;"Yeah back in the days. It's just like you'd be looking like music"

03:30;03:34;"They don't want to hear a hot fun in the summertime song. They wanted summertime sadness"
03:34;03:36;"Kiss me hot before you go"

05:28;05:32;"mid 90s to 100 every day and"

06:08;06:10;"I'm gonna like I can get this work done or I can"
06:10;06:16;"you know accomplish this like that sort of is out the window like summer becomes like a lot of work in a way and"
06:16;06:19;"You're in the middle of it. It's sort of probably like that"
06:19;06:24;"But then you'll find this like respite for these years, you know, once your kids in like full school mode"
06:24;06:29;"You're like, oh man, those like weekdays are like chill and then summer just becomes can can be just a lot"

06:39;06:43;"It's it's a hundred and eleven degrees. I'm not doing that. Yeah, I got this, you know"
06:43;06:50;"I got this big-ass dog that normally wants to walk for miles you get him outside right now"
06:50;06:54;"He's just like will not move and it's just sort of say I don't know if I left the house today"

07:08;07:10;"But you know this, you know"
07:10;07:15;"The other thing that we've talked a lot about is I had a teacher or a professor in college that you I think you took"
07:15;07:20;"A class with as well. Yeah, the legendary and Douglas of Columbia University"
07:20;07:26;"It was just the best and we took a film noir. I took a film noir class. I've often referenced to you"
07:26;07:31;"I don't think on the show and it was like talking about New York versus LA noir and how in New York"
07:31;07:35;"It's all shadows and it's all the sit, you know, like it's all secret alleyways, you know"
07:35;07:38;"And and that's where the sinister stuff happens and in LA"
07:38;07:45;"Yeah, it's just pulled into a dark alleyway in New York City pulled into the darkness and in LA darkness is the enemy"
07:45;07:52;"Yeah, and in LA the Sun is the enemy that the Sun is so there's you can't it's so oppressive and it's so there's no"
07:52;07:57;"There's no shadows that it's just like everything is seen and when it's summertime, baby"
07:57;08:02;"Feel it feels sinister. Yeah, I feel you the sinister son of Southern, California"
08:02;08:05;"Mm-hmm the sinister son of Southern, California"
08:05;08:13;"Yeah, that's the classic LA noir is somebody like hold up in a house looking through Venetian blinds as"
08:13;08:17;"Like that bright harsh Sun creeps in"
08:17;08:22;"And soon he'll walk to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again"
08:22;08:29;"If he goes back to the house then things will go from bad to worse what could he do?"
08:29;08:36;"He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that funny day"
08:36;08:46;"And if there is something else beyond he isn't scared because it's bound to be less boring than today"
08:46;08:49;"Bound to be less boring than tomorrow"
08:49;09:10;"Hillary went to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say"
09:13;09:17;"Everybody thought that she was boring so they never listened anyway"
09:17;09:24;"Nobody was really saying anything of interest she fell asleep"
09:24;09:33;"She was into S&M and Bible studies not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me"
09:33;09:40;"A cup of tea she would admit to no one a cup of tea. She would admit to me"
09:41;09:43;"a cup of tea she would admit to no one"
09:43;09:48;"Maybe you got to just try framing it as a"
09:48;09:54;"You know how there's like just like random dudes who are like into trains or like"
09:54;10:03;"Tornado chasers or something you got to become a heat junkie. Just wake up and just be like wow. We want triple digits"
10:03;10:05;"All right"
10:05;10:09;"Walking around with a little thermometer trying to get the hottest spot"
10:09;10:16;"Exactly. I guess that's like if you gotta like life is beautiful it for your kid. Just be like wake up, buddy. It's 104"
10:16;10:24;"You know taking photos every time my my phone says it's too hot, you know to operate"
10:24;10:27;"You know when the iPhone shuts down with a thermometer just getting psyched"
10:27;10:32;"Exactly. See if you can see if you can fry an egg on on your car"
10:32;10:39;"Do some like crazy stuff with well, don't kill bugs with a magnifying glass, but you could probably come up with a more humane"
10:40;10:41;"game to do with"
10:41;10:47;"Magnifying I don't see if you could set a piece of paper on fire in a bucket having to rebrand myself as a heat junkie"
10:47;10:49;"I like this. Yeah"
10:49;10:52;"Next to real heat junkie"
10:52;11:00;"I'm bringing back while we were by the way"
11:00;11:05;"Next time somebody's like being like, oh man, what a hot summer just be like"
11:06;11:13;"Yeah, real bummer. We almost made it up to 111. I was kind of disappointed. We topped out around 103"
11:13;11:18;"There's one day in August. We hit 103. I was I was hoping for like a 105 106. How about you?"
11:18;11:26;"How's your summer going? My summer has been great been here and there. I'm in New York City"
11:26;11:28;"back on the island"
11:28;11:30;"money making Manhattan, but"
11:30;11:33;"Wait, is that an old phrase?"
11:33;11:40;"Money making Manhattan. Yes, like early hip-hop. Okay, it's got you. Yeah, I feel like it was like the boogie down Bronx. Yeah"
11:40;11:49;"What would come again? But then it was money making man out of those places recently for some reason anyway, where I don't remember"
11:49;11:51;"I just I've heard it money making, Missouri"
11:51;11:58;"Money making Monrovia through the soybean industry. Yeah money making, Missouri"
11:59;12:01;"Absolutely"
12:01;12:30;"I love a"
12:30;12:32;"Bad"
12:32;12:34;"Like"
12:34;12:38;"Down like a penitentiary"
12:38;12:45;"She spreads her loving all over and when she gets home there's none left for me"
12:45;12:49;"Do it"
12:49;12:53;"Ratties on the microphone"
12:53;12:59;"All people in the dance to the three that will well qualified to represent the LBC"
12:59;13:01;"I"
13:01;13:13;"Love being on the East Coast in summer or because well, you know"
13:13;13:19;"I get to see friends and family and also I do feel spiritually connected to summer out here and"
13:19;13:22;"Recently I was in deep deep New York State"
13:22;13:28;"About as far as you can get from Manhattan like Western New York. Yeah deep Western, New York"
13:28;13:29;"and"
13:29;13:36;"I had some interesting experiences out there one of which I started because I this is actually turned into a bit of a TC experience"
13:36;13:44;"There was a little food mart near where I was, you know, just like a local kind of independent little mini mart"
13:44;13:46;"I noticed a few things"
13:46;13:53;"Some handwritten signs outside one of which was that like they had lots of kratom kratom. How do you say that?"
13:53;13:57;"Kratom not familiar. It's like a legal ish drug that"
13:58;14:00;"People are taking probably won't be legal forever"
14:00;14:05;"but the other thing that caught my eye at the front of this kind of quickie Mart was a"
14:05;14:11;"Handwritten sign that said fireball slushy. So of course I had to go find out what that was"
14:11;14:16;"It's just like one dude running the stores like what's up with the fire with fireball slushies and he's like"
14:16;14:20;"you know, I got my slush puppy machine and throw some fireball in there for you and"
14:20;14:26;"First thought in my head. I'm like, is that legal? Cuz like when I think of fireball, that's it's like whiskey"
14:27;14:31;"It's a type of hard alcohol. I guess I don't know that much about fireball. Do you guys know?"
14:31;14:35;"Yeah, I thought it was like this like a flavored, you know, like a spicy whiskey basically"
14:35;14:41;"Like a cinnamon, yeah liquor. Yeah, it's got like a devil breathing fire on it"
14:41;14:46;"So I'm kind of thinking like, you know, I wasn't like a pretty small town"
14:46;14:48;"so like maybe they got their own rules out there, but I was saying like"
14:48;14:55;"There's like something kind of like seemed a little bit like off about that. He's like, yeah, no problem"
14:55;14:59;"I'll make this slush puppy. You know, you pick your flavor slush puppy and I pour in the"
14:59;15:04;"Fireball and I'm like wait, don't you have to be like a bar to do that?"
15:04;15:10;"and I left and then I and then I kept thinking about it so like went back and had to try one and"
15:10;15:14;"He had this um a little plastic jug"
15:14;15:21;"Right by the cash register that's full of small bottles of fireball. Hmm, which has two amazing"
15:21;15:25;"slogans on the jug one was unleash the dragon and"
15:25;15:30;"The second one was fireball tastes like heaven burns like hell. I"
15:30;15:32;"Was like, okay"
15:32;15:37;"I like this and then you know, he's like, all right making a slush puppy with the classic slush puppy machine"
15:37;15:40;"you know with like that that cool dog would like the"
15:40;15:45;"Little beanie on and so he made one he'd like, you know"
15:45;15:52;"Pick your flavor and he'd pick I picked blue raspberry and he squirts that in and then he just reached into the jug took out"
15:52;15:56;"One of the little things of fireball and poured it in, you know, like an airplane sized bottle. Sure"
15:56;16:03;"You know, I was like, alright, thanks drank it insanely sweet bit cinnamon II, you know got a mild buzz"
16:03;16:08;"Maybe mostly from the sugar but I was like, okay, that was an interesting experience"
16:08;16:11;"I've never had a mixed drink at you know"
16:11;16:16;"A 7-eleven type place and I'm like thinking about that a lot and I wondered you know"
16:16;16:21;"Is this is this guy just kind of like doing his own weird thing? Is he gonna get in trouble for this?"
16:21;16:24;"I don't know, but then I looked it up and it turns out that"
16:24;16:31;"Yes, fireball as most people know it is a 33% alcohol whiskey"
16:31;16:37;"But they started selling these little bottles at like gas stations and mini-marts"
16:37;16:41;"That are not made out of whiskey. They're like"
16:41;16:44;"16% alcohol"
16:44;16:46;"like little malt beverages"
16:46;16:47;"hmm and"
16:47;16:52;"The packaging looks exactly the same and then it actually turns out that there's a class-action"
16:52;16:57;"Lawsuit against the fireball company because people were like this is false advertising"
16:57;17:02;"You have a well-known brand as a whiskey. You're selling these little bottles. It's only half the alcohol"
17:02;17:08;"It doesn't even have like the the main ingredient which is whiskey and they're popping up everywhere because a lot of these stores"
17:08;17:14;"I think that was confusing about a lot of these stores don't even have the license to sell hard alcohol. Mm-hmm"
17:14;17:19;"You know, they sell beer. All right, East Coast. The states are more uptight about"
17:19;17:24;"Liquor laws. Yeah, exactly. You got to go to a liquor store to get a bottle of whiskey, right?"
17:24;17:27;"So this is kind of started showing up at places. You normally wouldn't expect hard alcohol"
17:27;17:31;"So for all I know this is like a big trend fireball slushies"
17:32;17:38;"Uh, everywhere. So it's like a but if you just drank it straight it would would it taste like fireball, but it's actually I"
17:38;17:44;"Don't know what a malt like what is a malt liquor? Like I know that's like old English and stuff"
17:44;17:49;"I thought I was like Jason's a beer. I think it's just a way to produce alcohol. So I think"
17:49;17:56;"Malted alcohol is a way that they create alcohol for many of these weird new alcohol drinks"
17:56;18:03;"That malted liquor is the type of mass-market beer with a high alcohol content most closely associated with North America"
18:03;18:09;"Legally, it often includes any alcoholic beverage or it's any alcoholic beverage with 5% or more alcohol by volume"
18:09;18:13;"Made with malted barley. So it's like it is like a beer"
18:13;18:19;"Well, no, I think malt malt liquor is like a beer where they maybe add a bit or something"
18:19;18:20;"There's also malted"
18:20;18:21;"Alco they use malt"
18:21;18:27;"Malted barley to create the alcohol for all sorts of like random drinks because now you have we were in this era of just like"
18:27;18:29;"Alcohol drinks, you know"
18:29;18:35;"Like when we were talking about the rise of all these hard seltzers the white claws of the world and now"
18:35;18:40;"Wait, was it like Duncan is getting in the mix now? Yeah, there's a Duncan Donuts"
18:40;18:47;"like hard iced tea or something or hard hard mocha"
18:49;18:53;"Wait and they and they come in they come in a paper cup with the I mean it's spiked"
18:53;19:01;"I spiked iced coffees and iced teas like alcohol coffee in the same can that's that does not appeal"
19:01;19:06;"I mean, I think is your upper and your downer. I think that's like the for loco stuff, right?"
19:06;19:10;"Like it makes you insane because it wasn't for loco an energy drink with"
19:10;19:16;"Alcohol in it. Yeah. Yeah, they announced this a Duncan this hard Duncan news"
19:16;19:22;"People made a lot of jokes about like it's gonna be you need to call in the National Guard in Boston"
19:22;19:24;"that kind of stuff"
19:24;19:30;"The whole state of Massachusetts is gonna be so twisted all summer long"
19:30;19:35;"It's gonna be a real problem"
19:46;19:51;"For 17 long years"
19:51;20:00;"I spent all my money"
20:00;20:06;"On whiskey"
20:06;20:11;"And beer"
20:11;20:13;"I"
20:13;20:18;"Go to"
20:18;20:23;"Some hollow"
20:23;20:27;"And said"
20:27;20:31;"Of my still"
20:31;20:36;"And if whiskey"
20:39;20:41;"Don't kill me"
20:41;20:47;"And I don't know what will"
20:47;20:49;"I"
21:17;21:19;"Go to"
21:19;21:24;"Some by room"
21:24;21:28;"And drink"
21:28;21:33;"With my friends"
21:33;21:37;"Well the women"
21:37;21:40;"Can't follow"
21:40;21:45;"And see what I spend"
21:46;21:48;"God"
21:48;21:52;"Bless them pretty women"
21:52;21:57;"They was mine"
21:57;22:02;"Their breath is"
22:02;22:05;"That sweet"
22:05;22:09;"They do"
22:10;22:16;"Fine but the thing is about all of these whether it's it's the hard Duncans the white claws, whatever"
22:16;22:18;"back in our day"
22:18;22:22;"You normally would think of a mixed drink as being one of the standard"
22:22;22:28;"Alcohols mixed with something else. So we have this naive question, which is like"
22:28;22:33;"Oh what kind of alcohol like the same way if back in the day you go to a bar?"
22:33;22:37;"You know somebody make a mixed drink you might say like oh what kind of alcohol is in that?"
22:37;22:40;"Oh, yeah, it's actually it's rum or it's vodka or something"
22:40;22:45;"These are not made out of rum or vodka or whiskey the classics or tequila"
22:45;22:51;"They're made out of just like the cheapest type of alcohol you can put in some it's just alcohol"
22:51;22:56;"It's sometimes it's derived from malted barley or something, but it's like, you know, it's new school"
22:56;23:00;"It's just like the cheapest type of alcohol they can put into it, right?"
23:00;23:06;"and I think that's a little bit what's going on with this these cheap little fireballs and maybe that's why"
23:07;23:13;"Maybe these people win their class-action lawsuit because if you have an expectation that you're drinking something with like traditionally made whiskey"
23:13;23:15;"And it's just like some cheap"
23:15;23:21;"Maybe synthetics not the white right word, but it like just the cheapest type of alcohol you can buy"
23:21;23:25;"You're gonna feel a little ripped off. Listen. I was buying those airplane sized"
23:25;23:31;"Bottles of the gas station upstate New York, and I thought I was buying the finest whiskey"
23:32;23:39;"They were retailing for a dollar ninety-nine each. I feel ripped off. I was like, I wonder if it's a lawsuit"
23:39;23:43;"they they also have because you know, they always have to like the lawyer has to like list out the"
23:43;23:50;"You know frame things and like with like emotional distress and stuff like that and just be like right my client"
23:50;23:53;"drank five of these and"
23:53;23:57;"Was not remotely twisted. Yeah, this the synthetic"
23:57;24:01;"You know barley alcoholic slurry not cutting it"
24:01;24:03;"I"
24:03;24:08;"Failure to get twisted that night led my client to severe emotional distress"
24:08;24:11;"Well, there you go"
24:11;24:13;"Someone's doing the Lord's work taking on that case"
24:13;24:19;"Really swinging for the fences on that one. I still kind of wonder okay whiskey or not"
24:19;24:25;"It was still an interesting experience. Just like watching the dude behind the counter. Yeah, it's like"
24:26;24:31;"Make a mixed drink. So he didn't card you. No you get carded still"
24:31;24:39;"Very rarely you get carded. No, I think my final carding is behind me some places"
24:39;24:41;"Yeah, some places just do it"
24:41;24:43;"Like everything right?"
24:43;24:47;"Like I remember being the grocery store with my dad and like we were buying a bunch of wine or something and they like carded"
24:47;24:49;"my dad"
24:49;24:51;"It's just like really"
24:51;24:54;"Sorry, sir, like yeah. Well, I feel like this is a joke"
24:54;24:59;"I may have seen multiple times in TVs or move in TV or movies were like somebody"
24:59;25:03;"Gets carded an older person gets carded and was like, can I see your ID?"
25:03;25:10;"You got and they're just like oh you're making me feel so young. I'm actually, you know, 57 just like yes store policy"
25:10;25:16;"You know, I feel like I've witnessed that and I think if you go homes and programs"
25:16;25:22;"I think if you go to like an AMC movie theater like someplace that's like not normally"
25:22;25:28;"Like a liquor store bar. I've never not been carded or seen them card like my mom really"
25:28;25:31;"Yeah places that are just like it's policy"
25:31;25:36;"Don't give us a hard time. Don't make don't make this cute. I've been over 21 for a very long time"
25:36;25:38;"Yeah, I know just did this is what we do. Okay"
25:38;25:42;"We're not gonna have a cutesy little moment, ma'am"
25:42;25:47;"You're old. I'm looking at your old. I know your old. I know my boss is over there"
25:47;25:53;"Just just please pay me also when I was when I was in deep New York. I went to a bar. I"
25:53;26:00;"Might have been there on country music night and I heard a cool song that I wanted to play for you guys"
26:00;26:04;"Clear some people in the bar really knew this song. So this must be like must have been a big hit"
26:04;26:07;"10 15 years ago"
26:07;26:11;"The song I heard in the bar, which I don't think I'd ever heard before maybe you guys have"
26:12;26:16;"Is by Craig Morgan, it's called international harvester"
26:16;26:22;"I'm I feel like I know I'm I know my country music and I don't think I know this one"
26:22;26:27;"And it was like because where I was is kind of surrounded by farmland"
26:27;26:32;"So then I was like, oh, is this just like farmer country and then I looked it up and it's like no"
26:32;26:34;"This is like crossover country. It's about farming"
26:34;26:38;"Like when I got to the chorus like five people in the bar were yelling"
26:38;26:41;"I'm the son of a third-generation farmer"
26:41;26:46;"I've been married 10 years to the farmers daughter"
26:46;26:52;"I'm a God-fearing hard-working combine driver hogging up the road"
26:52;26:56;"I'm up a poop a plow or chubby look a look at five miles an hour"
26:56;26:59;"on my international"
26:59;27:01;"harvester"
27:01;27:04;"International harvesters like the company's"
27:04;27:07;"miles"
27:07;27:11;"I'm falling on down. Here's a call"
27:11;27:16;"Line up behind me like a big parade"
27:16;27:23;"Late to work road rage jerk shouting obscene words flipping me the bird"
27:23;27:31;"They may be on the state paper"
27:31;27:36;"That black top runs through my payload"
27:37;27:39;"I"
27:39;27:42;"Excuse me for trying to do my job this year ain't been no"
27:42;27:47;"Took me a long time to really understand. This is song is about eat"
27:47;27:53;"If you don't like the way I'm driving get back on the interstate"
27:53;27:58;"Otherwise sit tight and be nice and quit your honking and leave that away"
28:01;28:04;"He's on the highway driving his he's not on the highway"
28:04;28:10;"No, he's on the street like that. People are honking on the road. He's on the road trying to drive his"
28:10;28:14;"piece of giant farm machinery down the road and"
28:14;28:24;"But I'm proud to say I'm a God-fearing hard-working combine driver"
28:24;28:28;"Flower"
28:30;28:32;"Oh"
28:32;28:40;"Yeah, he's chugga-lugga-luggin five miles an hour, but this is also from the point of view of the harvester"
28:40;28:46;"Like this is because international harvester is the company. So this is from the point of view of the plow"
28:46;28:53;"Because he says I'm an international harvester. No, he says he's I'm on my international on"
28:53;28:56;"on an international harvester"
28:56;28:59;"Yes, it's not transformers"
28:59;29:01;"I"
29:01;29:03;"Understand I understand it's not transformers"
29:03;29:09;"But I would have been just sort of like a metaphorical leap that it could make and you're right"
29:09;29:16;"It's both because like this could also be the third generation of like this this plow has been giving three generations of farmers"
29:16;29:18;"Like action like this is like an old truck"
29:18;29:27;"I don't like it as much but again, I"
29:28;29:31;"Love it. I love that. He's on the on the side of the road"
29:31;29:36;"Like I mean, we've all been on like little farm roads and had to go around swerve around a dude driving a huge"
29:36;29:40;"I'm a combine but I love his vibe is like get on the interstate man. If you're in a hurry"
29:40;29:43;"I'm sorry that I'm in your way, but that's what the freeways"
29:43;29:52;"Hard-working combine driver"
29:52;29:57;"Flower chugga-lugga-luggin five miles an hour"
29:58;30:01;"Yeah, and when I said I didn't like it as much I just there was a moment"
30:01;30:05;"I was really into the idea of him writing it from the point of view of the machine"
30:05;30:12;"I love the idea. I love the idea that it is a transform actually that game as anybody ever tried to make like farmer transformers"
30:12;30:16;"I think you're gonna say has anyone ever written a song from the perspective of a transformer"
30:16;30:18;"probably"
30:18;30:20;"Yeah, probably"
30:20;30:22;"from"
30:22;30:28;"Optimus Prime. Yeah, Decepticon. So T-Grip. So so this one off in the bar you're saying? Yeah"
30:28;30:32;"Well, it was the bar was pretty empty, but I'm like listening to the song"
30:32;30:35;"I'm like kind of tapping my foot and I heard the beginning where it's like I hear the sky"
30:35;30:41;"I'm a god-fearing third-generation farmer and maybe because I was in a place that I'm not at that much a"
30:41;30:46;"Small town surrounded by farmland. I was like, oh, this is like a farmer song"
30:46;30:50;"And then I just saw people going I'm in it. Like I saw just a few people yelling out"
30:50;30:54;"I'm an international harvester. So I was like, okay, what is this song and"
30:54;30:57;"when I first heard it in the bar, I"
30:57;31:03;"Mostly just you know hearing that opening line. I was like, oh, this is just like a guy"
31:03;31:08;"Just kind of being like I'm a proud farmer, which is what the chorus is kind of art"
31:08;31:13;"But then I didn't realize that actually yeah, he's a proud farmer, but this is like a song about a situation"
31:13;31:17;"Which is that he's on he's on the country road"
31:17;31:24;"He's doing his job and all these people all these jerks are just so annoyed that he's going five miles an hour"
31:24;31:28;"And they have to get to work and stuff and he's just like man. I don't give a shit"
31:28;31:34;"I'm a proud farmer and you know what? This has been a hard year. It was not a bumper crop this year. Just shut up"
31:34;31:36;"It's like get on the interstate"
31:36;31:41;"He's doing the fall harvest and there's all these looky-loos out from the city out there to see the like fall"
31:41;31:46;"foliage colors right and they're just like in a hurry to like get you know to the"
31:46;31:52;"Scenic overlook to see all the orange and red trees. Yep. They got a reservation at the farm-to-table restaurant"
31:52;31:55;"there's a net a cute little Airbnb for the"
31:55;32:01;"Take for a week and he's just like this is my life out here. Well, and then it's some of them"
32:01;32:03;"He has some sympathy"
32:03;32:05;"he says"
32:05;32:07;"Well, I know you got your own deadline"
32:07;32:14;"But cussing me won't save you no time haas. Yep. This big wheel wide load ain't going any faster"
32:14;32:17;"so just smile and wave and tip your hat to the man on the tractor and"
32:17;32:20;"then I watched the video and"
32:20;32:27;"Of course, you know when they have to show like the different people caught behind it. There's some kind of just like"
32:27;32:30;"annoying businessman and"
32:30;32:32;"In a convertible just like oh, come on"
32:32;32:36;"For sake I got to get to work"
32:36;32:42;"So it is I guess it also just makes the song way funnier because like you could imagine a kind of like serious"
32:43;32:49;"Song where the guy's just like I'm proud to be a farmer. I got my kids. Have you in the 4-h Club?"
32:49;32:51;"Yeah, I'm married to a woman from a forget go to hell"
32:51;32:56;"Where is then suddenly he's like painting this just like comical picture where the guys just cut now"
32:56;32:59;"I kind of like just cuz at first I'm like, oh, what who is this guy?"
32:59;33:03;"Yeah, what's he so angry about and then you're kind of like then I'm just picture him going five miles an hour"
33:03;33:09;"And he's just kind of like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing my job. All right"
33:09;33:14;"This is this is like a funny moment in time and there's also something extra good about that"
33:14;33:22;"The the company that makes the combine is called International Harvester, but also like he could not be describing a more local story"
33:22;33:23;"Yeah"
33:23;33:29;"It couldn't be more just like yep. I don't leave the farm much you're on my little street"
33:29;33:36;"Go to hell. Well, like what you said is it's also like really great advice right for the guy behind"
33:37;33:44;"The guy caught up and say hey chill out. You got nowhere to be it reminds me of a recent essay from a friend of the show"
33:44;33:50;"Jonah Weiner in his blackbird spy plane newsletter. Did you read this one called go glam mode?"
33:50;33:53;"No, the whole essay"
33:53;33:55;"GLAM give the light a miss"
33:55;34:01;"Where he sort of rails on people who try to like cross the street very fast when they see the lights about the church"
34:01;34:04;"You know, they're like I got to get across the street and you go. Hey, you know what?"
34:04;34:09;"Give the light a miss just hang out. You got what's the extra 30 seconds for you to run across the street?"
34:09;34:12;"Your whole life would be better if you just"
34:12;34:15;"Not it could even be dangerous. Where are you gonna get to?"
34:15;34:20;"Why are you gonna push some lady out of the way, you know just to get across the street a little bit faster"
34:20;34:26;"I don't know. I think that there's it's definitely true of driving when you think about some of the dangerous maneuvers people pull"
34:26;34:31;"To shave three minutes off a drive. Yeah, like some guy pulling right around"
34:31;34:37;"You know, this guy's combine right into the other side of the lane trucks barreling down the road just to get around"
34:37;34:40;"I'm sure that's happened. And actually I was thinking to"
34:40;34:42;"this song"
34:42;34:44;"clearly was a big hit and"
34:44;34:48;"I actually imagine that this song has saved lives because"
34:48;34:55;"I'm not even kidding because like this was like a big country song of its era. Let's say"
34:55;35:00;"You know in certain parts of the country everybody listens to country music whether you're a farmer"
35:01;35:08;"Whether you're a lawyer in the city, whatever and just like all over, you know people from different walks of life have to you know"
35:08;35:12;"Share the same communities sometimes and I could totally picture like some hotshot"
35:12;35:16;"Want to move out to the country outside of like Nashville or something?"
35:16;35:22;"He drives his fancy car into the city to go work at the law office. Every once in a while"
35:22;35:24;"he might get caught behind a combine and"
35:24;35:30;"Probably is angry and I I bet this song once it came out diffused a few of those situations"
35:30;35:36;"Like somebody who's about to lay on the horn or like or do something kind of dangerous like pull around or like into the shoulder"
35:36;35:39;"You know, whatever probably like laugh to themselves and just was like"
35:39;35:46;"International harvester man. All right. All right. This is just one of those situations. I'm gonna wait patiently"
35:46;35:51;"Haha, I don't want to be like that guy profound wisdom. I love it. It reminds me of"
35:51;35:59;"I think I've referenced this before my my senior high school yearbook quote slow down to your food"
36:00;36:05;"Those my quote slow down to your food. I think you have really I didn't know that. Yeah, I love that"
36:05;36:11;"Wait, is that and were you quoting somebody that's a yes original? No. It's well, yes, it was"
36:11;36:15;"the Bill Murray character in Ghostbusters, he says that to"
36:15;36:21;"Dan Aykroyd, it's a very innocuous scene in the movie and Dan Aykroyd's just like scarfing down this Chinese food"
36:21;36:27;"Like right as they're getting the business started and they're stressed out about like money and like, you know"
36:27;36:30;"Just like getting the business off the ground and Ackroyd's just like stress-eating"
36:30;36:35;"And Maurice is like hey slow down. Chew your food. Slow down to your food"
36:35;36:42;"Great advice. Yep, you know hang out behind my mother says before, you know, my height my senior yearbook quote was I"
36:42;36:47;"Don't do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
36:47;36:56;"Do you know why I like that like double you you love me do you there's us?"
36:56;37:02;"Yeah, there's something about that that it's so pretty in the song. Do you love me? Do you but like written out?"
37:02;37:05;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl? I"
37:05;37:12;"Think I credit to Brian Wilson, which may or may not be true. I don't actually know if he wrote those lyrics"
37:12;37:18;"Little surfer, little one"
37:18;37:25;"May my heart come all undone"
37:25;37:33;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
37:33;37:38;"Surfer girl, my little surfer girl"
37:38;37:45;"I have watched you on the shore"
37:45;37:52;"Standing by the ocean's roar"
37:52;38:00;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
38:00;38:04;"Surfer girl, surfer girl"
38:04;38:13;"We could ride the surf together"
38:13;38:20;"While our love would grow"
38:20;38:27;"In my woody I will take you"
38:27;38:33;"Everywhere I go"
38:33;38:40;"So I say from me to you"
38:40;38:47;"I will make your dreams come true"
38:47;38:56;"Do you love me? Do you surfer girl?"
38:56;38:59;"Surfer girl, my little surfer girl"
38:59;39:07;"We're actually speaking of 80s movies quotes. Somebody was telling me about a band recently and they're they have a very long name"
39:07;39:16;"They're called I don't know how but they found us and somebody I was with immediately knew that that was a movie quote. Yeah, I know"
39:16;39:22;"Yeah, what is it back to the future? Is that an iconic line or that's just one of those movies?"
39:22;39:39;"I don't know how they found us. I've seen that movie a million times. I mean, it's not really like it's kind of like slow down to your food. I mean, I guess it's a little more climactic than slow down to your food, but it's when like they're testing out the time machine in the parking lot of the mall."
39:39;39:54;"Right. And then like the Libyans like Doc Brown had like just basically swindled the Libyan terrorists or whoever out of like plutonium to power the time machine. Oh, yeah. And then they showed up. Definitely. I remember the Libyans."
39:54;40:02;"That's what's the band called? It's I don't know how but they found us. I don't know how but they found us and people sometimes call them IDK how for short."
40:02;40:12;"What's their sound? I don't know. Matt, you want to throw in an IDK how but they found us song? That seems like I think from a different era, sort of like when there are bands named like and I think it's found me."
40:12;40:16;"Oh, I don't know how but they found me."
40:51;40:59;"What is this listed under Matt? What's their genre on Apple Music? Indie rock that references 80s movies."
40:59;41:12;"It looks like alternative also just to add the drummer is from the band Falling in Reverse and the vocalist I think was from another like pop punkish band."
41:12;41:27;"Oh, Panic at the Disco. Sorry, the singers from Panic at the Disco. The singer of this band used to be in Panic at the Disco. I was gonna say it had kind of Panic at the Disco vibes. It's a little alternative little pop punk little muse. Anyway, if you're back to the future fan, check them out."
42:31;42:34;"All right, let's get into it. Jake, you want to lead this one off?"
42:34;42:55;"Sure. I don't have much to lead it off with. I know I what I haven't not heard this. This hit the thread a few weeks ago that Fallout Boy did a version. Breaking news. Breaking news. Fallout Boy did a, I guess a rewrite of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start to Fire."
42:55;42:57;"I think this happened at least at least a month ago."
42:57;43:11;"Yeah. And that just seems like if anything's tailored for TC, that's it. So I guess they updated it. Obviously, Billy Joel's song was about, you know, the post-war era up until 1989, basically when that came out. So..."
43:11;43:12;"Right."
43:12;43:20;"JFK blown away. What else do I have to say? Kind of stuff. So this, they've rewritten it for the modern era. I don't know when they start. I'd be curious to see."
43:20;43:33;"Yeah. Well, first of all, my hat's off to Fallout Boy. It's a great idea. I wonder if anybody tried to do this before. How about before we even get into it, let's throw on that BJ, the original We Didn't Start the Fire."
44:19;44:23;"So just these listing stuff from the, basically the 50s."
44:38;44:40;"He's going kind of in front of us."
44:40;44:49;"Yeah, he starts with Truman, who was, you know, president in 1945, '46. Now we're up to Liberace."
44:49;44:51;"Is that Billy singing on the chorus?"
44:51;44:53;"Good question."
44:53;44:55;"It kind of doesn't sound like him."
45:00;45:02;"Roy Cohn."
45:02;45:04;"Roy Cohn. Interesting."
45:23;45:33;"So this starts in '49. At the beginning, this BJ's version starts at the beginning of 1949 and spans 40 years."
45:43;45:46;"Oh, I think it's when Billy Joel was born. Is that right?"
45:46;45:48;"That would track."
45:48;45:50;"Like starting his whole life."
45:50;45:55;"It would have been sick if by the time he got to the 70s, he just got fully into Billy Joel history."
45:59;46:01;"Billy Joel puts out the Stranger."
46:01;46:03;"Captain Jack Piano Man!"
46:03;46:09;"The Stranger. Cold Spring Harbor, The Stranger. Turnstiles. Glass Houses."
46:09;46:12;"And it is in chronological order."
46:12;46:15;"Christie Brinkley."
46:15;46:17;"Yes, she's the Uptown Girl."
46:17;46:21;"Uptown Girl, Christie Brinkley."
46:21;46:23;"Their divorce."
46:23;46:25;"Playing alimony."
46:25;46:30;"This starts talking about how Springsteen sucks."
46:30;46:31;"Yeah, exactly."
46:31;46:33;"Whoa, whoa."
46:33;46:35;"Playing alimony."
46:35;46:37;"Springsteen sucks."
46:50;46:56;"He dropped a reference to his prog rock band Attila."
46:56;46:57;"Are you familiar with them?"
46:57;47:00;"Oh, a little bit. I'm more of the big six."
47:03;47:06;"I like it because it gets into the international affairs stuff."
47:06;47:09;"Russians in Afghanistan."
47:09;47:11;"It's like Mickey Mantle and Russians in Afghanistan."
47:11;47:15;"They have the same weight."
47:15;47:21;"Which, if you're a kid in America growing up, Mickey Mantle's more important."
47:21;47:22;"Yeah."
47:22;47:26;"So when this song came out, people..."
47:26;47:27;"I might not have the timeline right."
47:27;47:33;"People thought he was ripping off the end of the world as we know it, R.E.M."
47:33;47:34;"Did they?"
47:34;47:36;"Interesting."
47:36;47:40;"Who was the first person to do this type of list song?"
47:40;47:47;"I mean, it's got to be folk songs that kind of work in this form, I would think."
47:47;47:48;"It's a good question."
48:02;48:05;"How do you interpret what the chorus means?"
48:05;48:10;"Because he's just listing stuff. Some of it's good. Some of it's tragic."
48:10;48:13;"He's just saying the world's all been crazy."
48:13;48:15;"But then he's talking about Doris Day and Mickey Mantle."
48:15;48:19;"I don't understand what is the perspective on this song?"
48:19;48:22;"That's a great question. I have thought about it before."
48:22;48:24;"And I think we've even talked about it on the show a bit."
48:24;48:27;"If you look at it through an anti-boomer lens,"
48:27;48:31;"which has been very fashionable the past however many years,"
48:31;48:35;"people always try to say, ""Oh, the boomer generation is self-absorbed."
48:35;48:41;"They think that their unique history on Earth is the most important journey."
48:41;48:43;"All right, we get it."
48:43;48:48;"You were born in this uptight world and the '60s changed everything."
48:48;48:53;"And now you guys are holding on to all the resources and you won't let go of power."""
48:53;48:58;"That's a certain take on the boomers we're all familiar with."
48:58;49:02;"So if you look at it through that kind of slightly negative lens,"
49:02;49:07;"you'd just be like, ""He was a boomer refusing to accept responsibility"
49:07;49:10;"for any role his generation may have played"
49:10;49:15;"in building the messed up current world that we live in."""
49:15;49:20;"I'm sure people have said that, ""Oh, Billy Joel, classic boomer denialism."
49:20;49:22;"Oh, what? What were we supposed to do?"""
49:22;49:23;"Because you hear that all the time."
49:23;49:26;"""Oh, they messed up the world,"" and this and that."
49:26;49:31;"I would think the slightly more sophisticated take or charitable take"
49:31;49:35;"is that Billy, like any member of his generation,"
49:35;49:40;"or let's say any member of any generation in the late '80s,"
49:40;49:44;"he's in his 40s now, he's grown up,"
49:44;49:47;"he's kind of bewildered by everything that's happened,"
49:47;49:52;"and he's really just saying that life is a crazy tapestry"
49:52;49:54;"of seemingly unrelated things."
49:54;49:56;"It can feel very chaotic."
49:56;49:58;"Culture is changing all the time."
49:58;50:01;"Politics is changing all the time."
50:01;50:04;"This good thing happens, a bad thing happens."
50:04;50:06;"Everything's constantly moving."
50:06;50:09;"Life is nothing but change and flux."
50:09;50:13;"And he's actually making a sophisticated plea to, like,"
50:13;50:16;"""Don't blame us, not because we didn't play a role in this."
50:16;50:20;"Of course we did, but because this is a sequence of events"
50:20;50:23;"that's been always burning since the world's been turning."""
50:23;50:26;"Life is a big, rich, weird tapestry."
50:26;50:30;"There are things that happened literally millions of years ago"
50:30;50:32;"that are still impacting things now,"
50:32;50:35;"and you can try to stop the change,"
50:35;50:37;"you can try to halt it in its tracks,"
50:37;50:40;"but trust me, by the time you're--"
50:40;50:42;"How old was Billy when he made this?"
50:42;50:43;"-40? -40?"
50:43;50:45;"I think maybe he's saying, ""You know what, guys?"
50:45;50:47;"By the time you're 40, you'll get it."""
50:47;50:50;"-Yeah, I can tell you. -And maybe somewhere"
50:50;50:53;"a young Pete Wentz was listening and saying,"
50:53;50:55;"""No, Billy, it is your fault."
50:55;50:57;"You started this damn fire."""

51:05;51:07;"Ezra's right."
51:07;51:10;"I asked Chet GPT,"
51:10;51:14;"""What is the meaning of Billy Joel's read 'Instart the Fire'?"""
51:14;51:17;"And not only were you right in the sentiment"
51:17;51:20;"of this collective unconscious that whatever it's pulling from,"
51:20;51:23;"you used the same words."
51:23;51:24;"-Overall-- -As Chet GPT?"

51:27;51:29;"of changing up people in the world,"

51:32;51:35;"they are also part of a larger tapestry of history"

51:37;51:39;"I mean, the fact that you even said ""a tapestry,"""
51:39;51:41;"-I find that-- -Whoa."

51:58;52:01;"This is how we found out we're in the machine."
52:01;52:03;"And you know who actually started the fire?"
52:03;52:05;"Prometheus."
52:05;52:07;"If anybody saw Oppenheimer,"
52:07;52:09;"they referenced the Greek myth of Prometheus a lot."
52:09;52:12;"He stole fire from the gods."
52:12;52:14;"-He started the fire. -That's why that book"
52:14;52:16;"is called American-- I see."
52:16;52:17;"-American Prometheus. -Yeah."
52:17;52:20;"Oppenheimer is the American Prometheus."
52:20;52:22;"I think I'm seeing it next week, folks."
52:22;52:23;"-When you watch it-- -Yeah?"

01:00:15;01:00:17;"Yeah, he's going to take pollution down to zero."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"The song, the theme song--"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Where would I have encountered this?"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Can we drop that-- Can we run that theme song?"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"You know what, Jake?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"This is where the years between really kick in."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"Was it on TV?"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"Yeah, it was on the television."
01:00:28;01:00:29;"Yeah."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"What year did this drop? Like '91?"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"It ran from '92 to '96."
01:00:35;01:00:38;"It was like a children's cartoon."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"Yeah, like, for older kids."
01:00:41;01:00:44;"I think this show is, like, really hitting when you're, like, eight, nine."
01:00:44;01:00:49;"Yeah, I was 14 in '91, so I missed this one."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"You were drinking Fireball by then."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"Jake was sneaking bottles of Fireball from the gas station by then."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Listening to ""Pavement."""
01:00:56;01:01:01;"It was co-created by Ted Turner, media mogul and CNN founder."
01:01:01;01:01:04;"He loved the environment, too, and there were, like, all the planeteers."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"One of them represented Earth, water--"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Ezra, you know what I'm talking about."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Fire was one."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Oh, yeah, of course."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Heart was the last one."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"Yeah, it was always a little confusing, Heart, but okay."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"I get it. Like, none of it works without Heart."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"I understand it now."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Whoopi Goldberg."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"It didn't make a lot--"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Yeah, it didn't make sense. I agree."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Yeah."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"At the time."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"And they would always be fighting, like, fat cat polluters, right?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Fat cat polluters."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"I feel like--"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Tycoons."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"There would always just be, like, yeah, some nasty tycoon just being like,"
01:01:32;01:01:37;"""And when I poison everybody in the entire city,"
01:01:37;01:01:43;"I'll make even more money when I make them drink my toxic sludge."""
01:01:43;01:01:45;"And they'd come and rough them up a little bit."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"It was like Voltron."
01:01:46;01:01:50;"They'd all say their elements, and then they would summon Captain Planet"
01:01:50;01:01:55;"from the sewer, and he would come and, you know, [bleep] up."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"And Whoopi Goldberg, friend of the show Whoopi Goldberg,"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"was the voice of Gaia, spirit of the Earth."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Oh, yeah."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"All right, let's move on Captain Planet, guys."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"I'm good."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"I actually don't need--"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"You know, I've got, like, a full primer course on Captain Planet."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"No, no, no."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"You should watch it."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I would start with the third season."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"I mean, you can go back and watch the first and second after."
01:02:15;01:02:19;"But, you know, if you watch season three through five,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"you'll take it down in about a week because you'll be watching"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"multiple eps a night."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"Jake, you got a DVD player?"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Do you have a DVD player in your house?"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"Of course."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Let's get him the box set."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"All right."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"We'll get you the DVD box set."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"OK, Captain Planet."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"Should we just do the song or just jump around?"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Should we just talk it through?"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Yeah."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Let's have Jake-- you should read it."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"OK, Captain Planet."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"You know what that is?"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Arab Spring."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Well, look, already in the first two lines,"
01:02:48;01:02:51;"they've established that you don't know what the hell you're in for."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"Yeah."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"I bet they actually--"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"I bet they put some thought into it."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"They're like, if we start with Captain Planet, Arab Spring,"
01:02:56;01:03:01;"people know that we're being chaotic and we're juxtaposing stuff,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"which I guess Billy Joel did, too."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"You know?"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Yeah."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"No, his was totally chaotic."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"It just was in order."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"But again, I don't think it really matters."
01:03:11;01:03:15;"Captain Planet, Arab Spring, LA riots, Rodney King,"
01:03:15;01:03:21;"deepfakes, earthquakes, Iceland volcano, Oklahoma City bomb--"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"That's all stuff that happened."
01:03:22;01:03:26;"Kurt Cobain, just the existence of Kurt Cobain."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"Oklahoma City bomb, Kurt Cobain, Pokemon, Tiger Woods, MySpace."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Billy Joel did."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"He would just list--"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Yeah, Doris Day."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Billy Joel just listed people."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"Yeah."
01:03:35;01:03:39;"Doris Day, Joe DiMaggio, Tiger Woods, MySpace, Monsanto GMOs."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"So sometimes they'll pair stuff."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"They'll pair LA riots and Rodney King."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"They'll pair Monsanto GMOs."
01:03:45;01:03:49;"Harry Potter, Twilight, Michael Jackson dies,"
01:03:49;01:03:52;"nuclear accident-- oh, Fukushima, Japan,"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"Crimean Peninsula, Cambridge Analytica,"
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Kim Jong-un, Robert Downey Jr., Iron Man."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"This would be hard to sing."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"These syllables are just like--"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"It's very dense."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"You need to know the specific delivery."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"Yeah, I don't have that down quite yet."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"More war in Afghanistan, Cubs go all the way again."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"That's pretty funny."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Well, they're from Chicago."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"OK."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"They have a Chicago POV."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Oh, and they shout out Kanye West later."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"Yep."
01:04:20;01:04:24;"Obama, Spielberg, explosion, Lebanon."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"When was the explosion in Lebanon?"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"I thought that was 1982."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"What was-- no, no, no."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"There's a huge one in Beirut."
01:04:30;01:04:35;"It was like a factory exploded that was full of explosives."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Oh."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"It rocked the whole city."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Right, right."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"Yeah, it was 10 years ago."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"Yeah, 2020."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"No, no, no, no."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"That was recent."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Oh, god."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"Again, time is a flat circle, right?"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"It's kind of what the songs say."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"I like this one."
01:04:50;01:04:54;"Unabomber, Bobbitt, John, bombing Boston Marathon."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"That's a good line."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"Unabomber, Bobbitt, John, bombing Boston Marathon."
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Balloon Boy, war on terror, QAnon."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Good alliteration."
01:05:03;01:05:06;"Do you remember-- where were you when the Balloon Boy--"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"were you captivated?"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Do you remember where you were?"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"I don't remember the Balloon Boy."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"I barely-- wait, was Balloon Boy a hoax?"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"What was that?"
01:05:13;01:05:16;"Yeah, Balloon Boy captivated America when the balloon--"
01:05:16;01:05:22;"there was a balloon that took off from the home of a family."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"And it was reported that there was a boy in the balloon."
01:05:26;01:05:31;"And it was like-- this was live on television for hours."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"And I remember everything stopped when the Balloon"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"Boy went sky high."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"And then it turned out to be a hoax."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"There was no boy, ultimately, in the balloon."
01:05:42;01:05:45;"They were very worried he was going to lose oxygen."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"I remember that."
01:05:46;01:05:50;"And they were saying, uh-oh, the Balloon Boy's lost oxygen."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"Six-year-old boy."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"Where was that?"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"Fort Collins, Colorado."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Deep."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"So wait, what year was that?"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Was it like early Twitter era?"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"2009."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Before."
01:06:01;01:06:04;"Yeah, that might have been right when Twitter was popping off."
01:06:04;01:06:10;"So early Obama years, he sent some F-16s to try to take it down."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"I don't think he shot down-- did he?"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"Did he try to shoot down the Balloon Boy?"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"I think the generals-- he was circled by F-16s."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"And Obama said, hold your fire."
01:06:18;01:06:22;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"They were ready to take him out."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"And Obama said, one of two things is true."
01:06:25;01:06:28;"Either there's a six-year-old boy on that balloon,"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"and I don't want him to be bombed to pieces, or that he's not,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"and it's a waste of ammunition."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"Either way, hold your fire."
01:06:36;01:06:39;"And the generals were like, President, please!"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:41;01:06:47;"That was a defining decision point in his first administration."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"Yeah, Balloon Boy, I kind of forgot about."
01:06:50;01:06:52;"But that's the fun of a song like this."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"Yeah."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"They make you think about everything that's happened in the past."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"This is a pretty bleak one."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Trump gets impeached twice."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Polar Bear's got no ice."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Polar Bear's got no ice."
01:07:05;01:07:09;"Fire Fest, Black Parade, Michael Phelps, Y2K."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"What's Black Parade?"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"I was about to ask if you knew that."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"No."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"You want to guess?"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Is it a band?"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Close."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Is it like a festival?"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"No."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"Getting a little cooler."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"OK, it's a band."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"You're warm."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"DJ?"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"A little cooler."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Go back to band."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"A rap group?"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"No, no, I'm saying go back to band."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"Band?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"You're warm when you're on band."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"Are they a rock band?"
01:07:35;01:07:36;"No."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"Well, OK, but it's something adjacent to a rock band."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"Something a rock band might-- what are things that rock bands do?"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"Tour?"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"Put out records?"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Yes."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"Warmer."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Is it a record?"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"Black Parade."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"Is it a record label?"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"No, no, you're right."
01:07:55;01:07:56;"No, you're right."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"It's an album."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"Do you have any idea who made it?"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"Fall Out Boy?"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"Warm."
01:08:01;01:08:04;"I don't know how to get warmer from Fall Out Boy."
01:08:04;01:08:09;"I don't know which direction I'm headed here."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"Right, you got to throw out another band."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"Deeper into emo rock?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Yes."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"I don't know."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"I don't like any of those bands."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"You're never going to guess this one."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"No, I can't remember, probably."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"OK, I'll give you one last hint."
01:08:22;01:08:27;"They're from New Jersey, and their singer's name is Gerard Way."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"Three words."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"I think that might be why you said it was close."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Three words."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"I don't know the song Black Parade for Jake."
01:08:34;01:08:37;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:08:37;01:08:46;"I've heard-- did Kanye say all this?"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"No."
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Oh, yeah, I've heard this."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"It might have inspired Runaway."
01:08:52;01:08:55;"Yeah, yeah, that song on Twisted Fantasy."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"Jake, for a certain generation of emo kids,"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"this is Bohemian Rhapsody."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:09:02;01:09:15;"I've heard this song before."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"It's cool."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Yeah, it is a cool song."
01:09:17;01:09:21;"It's a triumphant, dramatic song."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Do I know the name of the band?"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"It's--"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Was that big single from the album before this,"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"the I'm Not OK song?"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"I always like that song."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"This is this band's Sergeant Pepper."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Before they made this--"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"this is like before they went Sergeant Pepper."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"This is their, like, please, please me."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:09:43;01:09:49;"So they were contemporaries of Fall Out Boy."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"I'm sure I've heard the name."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"Like, when we say the name--"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"First word, my."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Chemical Romance."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Yeah, well done."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"OK, well done."
01:10:00;01:10:03;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:10:03;01:10:13;"Yeah, this is always has great melodies."
01:10:13;01:10:16;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"This is--"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"[MUSIC - JAKE, ""BLACK PARADE""]"
01:10:20;01:10:44;"So that might be the only album that just shouts out--"
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Yeah."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Black Parade."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"I guess it makes sense that for Fall Out Boy fans,"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"Black Parade maybe is kind of like a Sergeant Pepper."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"You want to hear a very quick--"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"It's a very important album."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"You want to hear a very quick--"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"what I think is like fascinating--"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"it's sort of almost related to Read and Start the Fire,"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"My Chemical Romance story."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Yeah."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Gerard Way had sold a--"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"he wasn't going to be in a band."
01:11:07;01:11:10;"My Chemical Romance doesn't exist."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"He wanted to make cartoons and comic books,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"which he ended up doing."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"He created the comic book--"
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Oh, yeah, Umbrella Academy."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"--for Umbrella Academy."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Huge, huge success."
01:11:18;01:11:19;"And they made a TV show."
01:11:19;01:11:24;"Yeah, so he went and sold a show to Cartoon Network."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"And he was like, that's it."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"I'm going to make a TV show."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"Or maybe he had set up a pitch to pitch them."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"And he was feeling, all right, this is going to be my career."
01:11:31;01:11:32;"He's a young guy."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"Got time to make the pitch."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"Sat down with some network executives."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"I can't remember if it happened, if they bought it or not."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"But basically 9/11 happened."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Maybe the day that it was--"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Whoa."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"I think if I remember correctly, it's"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"like the day that he's supposed to actually pitch is 9/11."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"It was 9/11."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"And so they canceled the pitch."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"He doesn't do it."
01:11:53;01:11:57;"And he goes, I don't know."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Either this is a sign, or I don't"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"know when I'm going to get a pitch back on the books."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"And that side of the career is over."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"And he, out of that, immediately, I think,"
01:12:06;01:12:09;"started working on My Chemical Romance."
01:12:09;01:12:10;"Whoa, that's crazy."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Isn't that crazy?"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"So truly, it was--"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"and I said, we didn't start the fire away."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"Because they must-- they shot out 9/11, right?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Is there a 9/11 in the--"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"There is."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"World Trade Second Plane."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"What else do I have to say?"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:26;01:12:27;"So there you go."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"So World Trade Second Plane, My Chemical Romance began."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Wow."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"That's an amazing story."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"That's wild."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Talk about a sliding doors moment."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Yeah."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"I wonder if Osama bin Laden never knew that."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Osama bin Laden, well, they always"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"claim he had all this random stuff on his hard drives."
01:12:43;01:12:46;"That sounds like the type of thing you would hear."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Or it seems like--"
01:12:47;01:12:52;"you know that Osama bin Laden had a whole rip of Black Parade"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"by My Chemical Romance on his hard drive?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"They found his LimeWire."
01:12:55;01:12:56;"I always hear stuff like that."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"They had his LimeWire account."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Don't they always say stuff like that?"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"Like, oh, yeah, he had two seasons of Family Guy."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"Yeah."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Sex in the City."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"A bunch of porn."
01:13:05;01:13:06;"Sex in the City."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Really surprising stuff."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"So what he actually had was he had video games."
01:13:12;01:13:17;"He had Yoshi's Island, Final Fantasy, Mr. Bean."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"He had memes."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"He was into memes."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"Ooh, early, early memes."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"Mr. Bean was international."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"Early in the memes."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"Those are classics."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"Some pre-9/11 memes."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"Well, shout out to Fallout Boy."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"It's a fun song."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"It says in our notes that it got a lot of negative reactions."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"All the haters can go to hell."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Not on this show."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"We're pro."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"And anyway, to anybody talking s***,"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"I want to hear your We Didn't Start the Fire."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"I love that this became a tradition every year."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"Somebody has to step up and do a We Didn't Start the Fire."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"That would be a very fun exercise to sit around with your friends"
01:13:52;01:13:57;"and just like with the spiral ring notebook and just like--"
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Just co-write it together, sitting around."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Yeah."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Order some Chinese food, crack some brews."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Yeah, a New Year's tradition."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"We Didn't Start the Fire 2023."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Am I making this up as well?"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"Isn't Pete Wentz a huge fan of Neo Yokio?"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"He was a big supporter of Neo Yokio."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"Yeah, he was a big early fan."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And I've always been a huge fan of his"
01:14:19;01:14:25;"because one thing that's really cool about him is he's a Pete Townsend type"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"in that he is not the singer of the band, but he's the primary lyricist."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"Oh, interesting."
01:14:31;01:14:32;"I did not know that."
01:14:32;01:14:36;"And I think they really have a very specific lyrical style."
01:14:36;01:14:38;"You think even their early hit,"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"♪ Going down, down, I'll be your number one ♪"

01:14:47;01:14:51;"And I always find that interesting when he's the bassist writing the lyrics"
01:14:51;01:14:55;"and clearly he's got this kind of mind meld with the singer."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Anyway, shout out to Fall Out Boy."

01:16:14;01:16:16;"Why 1999?"
01:16:16;01:16:22;"Because we're continuing our episode to year matching system."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"This is episode 199."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"That's crazy."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Next episode we've done 200."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"We're going to do something."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Yeah, crazy."
01:16:30;01:16:34;"So we're doing 1999 because it's close to 199."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"So the number five song this week in 1999,"
01:16:37;01:16:41;"well this is an all-time classic, Smash Mouth, ""All Star."""
01:16:41;01:16:43;"♪ Somebody once told me the world is too lonely ♪"

01:17:02;01:17:04;"No, that's true. That's exactly right."
01:17:04;01:17:06;"For the Zoomers, this is the Shrek song."

01:17:30;01:17:33;"Yeah, no, Smash Mouth, they--"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"That was Three Doors Down."
01:17:35;01:17:41;"Smash Mouth got in some sort of fight at like a state fair or something."

01:18:01;01:18:02;"Yeah."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"Never one of my favorites."
01:18:04;01:18:08;"Y'all remember the movie Mystery Men, Ben Stiller?"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"No."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"Yes."
01:18:10;01:18:13;"I never saw it. It's about, like, goofy superheroes?"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"Yeah. It's Hank Azaria, friend of the show Hank Azaria, isn't it?"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"Oh, yeah."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Jimmy Garofalo?"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"Jimmy Garofalo, that's right, yeah."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Who else was in it?"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Paul Reubens."
01:18:25;01:18:28;"Eddie Izzard, Paul Reubens, Tom Waits."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Oh, cool. Rest in peace."
01:18:29;01:18:33;"So this was originally for that soundtrack,"
01:18:33;01:18:37;"and if you watch the music video, it's all, like, clips of Mystery Men,"
01:18:37;01:18:43;"but it's known for its association with Shrek years later."

01:19:35;01:19:37;"Taylor Swift with ""Cruel Summer."""
01:19:37;01:19:41;"I guess this is a Nick kind of song. It's an anti-summer."

01:19:54;01:19:58;"due to Swift's The Heiress Tour, which kicked off in March 2023."
01:19:58;01:20:01;"She would open each show with the ""Lover"" section,"
01:20:01;01:20:04;"with ""Cruel Summer"" being the second song played."
01:20:04;01:20:08;"Are you aware of this, Jake, that Taylor Swift is the new Grateful Dead?"
01:20:08;01:20:12;"I do see a lot of hubbub in the media about this tour."
01:20:12;01:20:16;"What exactly is so insane about this tour? Can someone explain it to me?"
01:20:16;01:20:21;"It is going to be the biggest tour of all time, at least in terms of money."
01:20:21;01:20:24;"Because the tickets are so much?"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"I mean, obviously she's playing huge."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"She's on tons of tickets. Yeah, of course."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"She's filling the stadiums."
01:20:30;01:20:33;"I guess she hasn't done a big tour in a while because of COVID and stuff."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"Her popularity has ascended to this place where,"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"and because she's calling it the Heiress Tour,"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"it's like she's digging into the archives, playing."
01:20:42;01:20:44;"It's a really long show."
01:20:44;01:20:48;"She's playing stuff from throughout her whole career."
01:20:48;01:20:53;"The set list is fairly consistent, but there's a surprise song or two every night."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"To me, it sounds a little more like a Bruce Springsteen show than a Grateful Dead show."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"Well, I think just why you're hearing so much about it,"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"outside of it being one of the largest tours,"
01:21:03;01:21:08;"there's a lot of news around how it's saved certain economies."
01:21:08;01:21:13;"Its GDP is insane."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"What does it say?"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"Swift could add over $4.6 billion in consumer spending to the U.S. economy."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"That's a lot of nachos."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"I think that's been a huge part."
01:21:25;01:21:28;"When she does two nights at the Taco Bell Dome or something,"
01:21:28;01:21:32;"people are buying hotels, renting cars."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Okay."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Wow."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"All right."
01:22:05;01:22:10;"No hot takes, other than I didn't know that St. Vincent Andy Clark was a songwriter on this song."
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Learn something new every day."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"The number four song this week in 1999."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"Wow."
01:22:17;01:22:20;"These 1999 songs, I know this so well."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Isn't that a thing people say?"
01:22:22;01:22:30;"There's something about the summer you were 14 is some kind of meaningful thing."
01:22:30;01:22:35;"This is actually the summer I was 15, but I just know this so well."
01:22:35;01:22:37;"I know all these songs so well."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"This is LFO with Summer Girls."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"It's from 1999."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"This is pro summer."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"Yeah."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"This is pre-9/11."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"When you could still enjoy the summer."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"Yeah."
01:22:51;01:22:55;"Back in '99, if you got a triple digit day, you didn't cry."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"You said, ""Wa wa wee wa,"" and you said high five your friend."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Gosh darn, it's hot outside."
01:23:01;01:23:05;"Oh boy, another triple digit day."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"Let's go get milkshakes."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Yeah."
01:23:08;01:23:27;"I noticed they credit Gary Cherone and Nudel Benincourt who are in that band Extreme."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"I'm assuming this is a sample."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"Oh, yeah, it's the guitar sample, I'm assuming."
01:23:32;01:23:35;"Yeah, it's for More Than Words."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Right."
01:23:36;01:23:49;"People always clown on this song, but I've always found it kind of poignant."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"It's got a little bit of We Didn't Start the Fire in it."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"It does."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"It's just listing pop culture."
01:23:56;01:24:02;"Oh, yeah, we did do a whole thing on this."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"It's that crazy line, ""Chinese food makes me sick."""
01:24:05;01:24:06;"Right."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"I'd like to be charitable towards LFO."
01:24:09;01:24:18;"He probably had maybe had one bad experience at a Chinese restaurant, but not that cool to say Chinese food makes me sick."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"I wonder if Ed Sheeran was thinking about this song when he wrote, what's that song?"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"Yeah, what is that song that we talked about a thousand times?"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"I don't remember."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Shape of You."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Yeah, that's a TC classic."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Yeah, I kind of like this song."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"I mean, it's a good vibe."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"I like this kind of like mellow, like whisper rap."
01:24:39;01:24:44;"Like last episode, we went out on that 80s LL Cool J song, I Need Love."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:45;01:24:51;"I kind of just, I like this kind of like, just chill, kind of breezy, summery, like rap."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"Rap ballad."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"It's wistful."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"It's sweet and sad."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"I like a rap ballad."
01:24:55;01:25:03;"I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer, for the summer."
01:25:03;01:25:07;"I could also just like picture this dude so well."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"This could be a good Netflix series."
01:25:10;01:25:18;"Just like, three young white hip hop fans have one unforgettable summer."
01:25:18;01:25:22;"He's kind of like, want to be tough guys."
01:25:22;01:25:25;"Maybe could have Chet Hanks in it."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"He could play one of the guys."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"And he's like, they're kind of learning to express their emotions a little bit."
01:25:30;01:25:36;"And there could be like a pivotal scene where like, he like can't tell the girl he loves her."
01:25:36;01:25:42;"But he's just like, you know, I just want to say it was pretty fly that you stopped by this summer."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"She's realized he's doing his best."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"And she's like, thanks."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Anyway, have fun at Harvard."
01:25:48;01:25:53;"I'm just going to stay in this town."
01:25:53;01:25:58;"Wait, Chet Hanks is supposed to be a teenager in this version?"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Like it's like a 19 year old?"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"Yeah, he can do high school."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Classic casting."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"But you know, I mean, adulthood starts so late now."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I mean, he could be 40."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Yeah, maybe."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"She's not going to Harvard."
01:26:11;01:26:14;"She's just like, she's just moving for work."
01:26:14;01:26:17;"He met a lawyer on Raya."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"She's taking the summer off between jobs."
01:26:20;01:26:26;"She's about to move to Singapore to work for some international finance company."
01:26:26;01:26:32;"But she goes back to her family's shore house for one last summer."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Chet Hanks plays this kind of like townie."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"He used to rap."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"It's a little bit like 8 Mile Energy."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"Where's he working that she runs into him all the time?"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"He's working at the, originally I was going to say he's working at like the Jersey Mike's,"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"but she's not popping into the Jersey Mike's."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"Maybe he used to be the lifeguard."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"Oh, nice."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"He used to be the lifeguard at the local pool."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"Yeah."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"Then they were like, you know what, man, you're just too old."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"It's kind of like creeping people out."
01:26:58;01:27:03;"Like normally, normally the oldest lifeguard is like 25 and you're like 41."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"And he's like, what?"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"But I work here every summer."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"And they're just like, you know what, actually the old janitor just,"
01:27:09;01:27:12;"the old janitor just died."
01:27:12;01:27:15;"You can be the janitor now."
01:27:15;01:27:21;"And he's just like, oh, hell no."
01:27:21;01:27:26;"Oh, hell no."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"The elderly janitor just died."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"Chet has been demoted from lifeguard."
01:27:32;01:27:37;"He's like cleaning up puke, super burned out."
01:27:37;01:27:43;"And then there's like a cool single 38-year-old lawyer in between jobs"
01:27:43;01:27:46;"back staying at the family house."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"And, you know, she's got her own problems,"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"but they have this like summer romance."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"And I don't know."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"He tells her it was pretty fly that she stopped by."
01:27:56;01:28:00;"You know, and there's a little bit of like something about Mary Energy."
01:28:00;01:28:04;"Of course, we're going to have a real iconic gross-out humorous scene at the"
01:28:04;01:28:09;"Chinese restaurant with projectile vomiting."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:10;01:28:13;"He's got to run to the bathroom, you know, and there's no bathroom."
01:28:13;01:28:14;"You can't use it."
01:28:14;01:28:17;"It's only for employees."
01:28:17;01:28:20;"It's going to be full on."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Wait, he's got--"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Triangle of sadness."
01:28:23;01:28:28;"He's got hardcore IBS, but he goes there to impress her because she likes"
01:28:28;01:28:33;"Chinese, but the IBS is just like, it's uncontrollable."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"And it's going to be extremely graphic."
01:28:35;01:28:40;"He pukes all over the buffet."
01:28:40;01:28:42;"She looks in her bag for a second."
01:28:42;01:28:47;"He pukes into his food, but he doesn't want to admit it at first."
01:28:47;01:28:52;"And she's like, Chet, aren't you going to eat some more of this delicious"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"Chinese food?"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"This is going to be a legendary-- it could be a movie."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"It could be a series."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Anyway, it's called Summer Girls."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"It's going to be on Hulu."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"It comes out next June."
01:29:05;01:29:10;"The number four song this week on Apple Music, Travis Scott featuring Drake"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"with Meltdown."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"Jake, you check out the new Travis Scott album?"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"I have not yet."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Who has?"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Have you scoped it?"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"I have."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"No."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Yeah."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"I give it a scan."
01:29:25;01:29:30;"It's-- I mean, it's pretty-- the only way I could describe it is that it"
01:29:30;01:29:36;"does sound like an AI-- you basically said make a Kanye album with"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Travis Scott."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"It's very strange."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"You know, there's always been a connection between Travis Scott and"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Kanye."
01:29:44;01:29:46;"And, you know, he's his protege."
01:29:46;01:29:50;"But there's something about this that feels-- it feels weird."
01:29:50;01:29:56;"And I think that there is-- I read some review that said that Travis Scott"
01:29:56;01:30:02;"was single white femaling Kanye, which I thought was actually really"
01:30:02;01:30:03;"accurate."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Very funny and very accurate."
01:30:04;01:30:07;"Yeah, it's definitely a new hip-hop classic."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"Is it a new hip-hop?"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Well, I mean, it's huge."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"I'm not hearing the Kanye."
01:30:39;01:30:42;"This is the-- honestly, this is probably the only song that's not-- if"
01:30:42;01:30:46;"you put on the first or second song, I mean, it's pretty weird."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"I mean, I would say put on the first song if you want to hear it."
01:30:49;01:30:50;"We're good."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"You don't need to."
01:30:51;01:30:55;"I find it a bit sort of disappointing and sad as a huge Kanye."
01:30:55;01:30:59;"I got to say, I mean, I'm hearing this song for the first time via"
01:30:59;01:31:03;"FaceTime, but it's no ""Summer Girls."""
01:31:03;01:31:05;"I'm sorry, but hip-hop peaked in 1999."
01:31:05;01:31:11;"Speaking of 1999, the number three song in '99, ""Casey and JoJo""--"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"--""Tell Me It's Real."""
01:31:18;01:31:23;"So ""Casey and JoJo"" just crushed it in the '90s, first with ""Jodeci,"""

01:31:25;01:31:26;"I'm trying to remember this one."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I definitely remember ""All My Life."""
01:31:28;01:31:32;"Oh, this one's-- this song's awesome."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Oh, it sounds so good."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"Those '99 keyboard sounds."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Very similar palette to Mariah Carey, ""Always Be My Baby."""
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Mm-hmm."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Loving this BPM."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"Yeah, this feels good."

01:32:46;01:32:47;"What was their story?"

01:32:50;01:32:52;"Do you know anything about them?"
01:32:52;01:32:57;"They were in this group, Jodeci, that was huge."
01:32:57;01:32:58;"Let's see."
01:32:58;01:33:02;"Jodeci was formed in 1989 in Charlotte, North Carolina."
01:33:16;01:33:19;"And then Casey and JoJo went and did their own thing."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Tight."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"So they're from North Carolina."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"But then they came back together."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Yeah."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"But Casey and JoJo are brothers."

01:52:14;01:52:16;"It opens with the night they got Bin Laden."
01:52:16;01:52:20;"And then it cuts to next summer."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"You got to get a real job, man."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"He's like, ""I was on Seal Team 6."""
01:52:24;01:52:28;"They're like, ""That was over a year ago."""
01:52:28;01:52:30;"You're back in the real world, man."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"You got him."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"That's how I'm living in the past."
01:52:33;01:52:38;"But it was a mashup."
01:52:38;01:52:42;"The last words he heard is, ""It's a mashup."""
01:52:42;01:52:45;"By the way, it's a mashup."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"Oh, my God."
01:52:46;01:52:55;"CIA was like, ""We're picking up some chatter that Bin Laden is a holdup at a house in Pakistan."
01:52:55;01:53:01;"And he's been listening to 'A Stroke of Genius' quite a bit."
01:53:01;01:53:06;"And we're getting word from some of our people on the ground that he thinks it's an original."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"He thinks that's an original?"
01:53:08;01:53:10;"The vocals barely even fit."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"Well, you know, he's an older guy."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Why the f***?"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"He doesn't know who the Strokes are."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"Wait, you know the Strokes' first album came out on 9/11?"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"That's right."
01:53:19;01:53:22;"Oh, we didn't start the fire."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"Okay, yeah."
01:53:23;01:53:25;"This is too dark."

01:53:32;01:53:34;"I don't think I have the..."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"We don't have the energy to get into this whole song."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"Everybody's talking about this song."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"Nick, you told me about this song last week."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Oliver Anthony, Rich Men North of Richmond."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"I don't have the energy."
01:53:43;01:53:44;"I mean, it's true."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"It's true."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"This is a whole other episode."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"If you haven't heard about this, this is a viral song."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"He's a country guy and he's kind of like..."
01:53:52;01:53:56;"It's been called a blue collar anthem as well as a right wing anthem."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"The song discusses a number of social issues including inflation taxes,"
01:54:00;01:54:03;"welfare abuse, and child trafficking."
01:54:03;01:54:07;"Notable right wing pundits including Matt Walsh, Benny Johnson,"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"and Carrie Lake have championed the song."
01:54:09;01:54:14;"This is time crisis."
01:54:14;01:54:17;"It's crazy he gets into child trafficking."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"That is truly like..."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Yeah, there's a line about like..."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"Epstein."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Yeah, they're saying about the minors."
01:54:23;01:54:27;"He says something about the minors which I think he's talking about"
01:54:27;01:54:30;"actual minors like in a cave, in a mine."
01:54:30;01:54:36;"And then he says and minors with an OR but not ones just on an island."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Oh."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"This is like the new We Didn't Start the Fire in a way."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"Like this is the real..."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"He's calling out the elites."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Yeah, he's calling out the elites."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Yeah, but let's..."
01:54:44;01:54:47;"Ezra just wants to get on."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Ezra just wants to like end the episode right now."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"He wants to check out Sovette."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"[Laughter]"
01:54:53;01:54:56;"We'll go deep on this in two to four weeks as per..."
01:54:56;01:54:59;"No, because I feel like this song is a real social phenomenon"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"and this needs time."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"All right, we'll circle back."
