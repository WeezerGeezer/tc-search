00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. We're joined by a very special guest, a man from the East."
00:08;00:17;"You know who it is. Despot. We also count down the top hits of 1946 and today. All that,"
00:17;00:23;"plus some Oscars talk, a dip in the mailbag, and a little sneak preview of Vampire Weekend's"
00:23;00:33;"upcoming tour. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-b-b-b-b-b-beastmode one."
01:20;01:26;"Time Crisis, back again. I'm joined in our Los Angeles studio by Jake as always."
01:26;01:27;"Hey."
01:27;01:32;"And a very special guest, the head of Time Crisis East, Despot."
01:32;01:33;"Hi."
01:33;01:35;"President of TC East."
01:35;01:37;"I didn't know I was the head or the president."
01:37;01:38;"Well."
01:38;01:39;"Or both."
01:39;01:41;"You just got a promotion."
01:41;01:42;"Thanks."
01:42;01:45;"It's actually really winter here. For the first time I can remember."
01:45;01:51;"The whole time I've been here, rainy and cold. And you guys don't know how to drive when it's raining."
01:51;01:53;"And you get scared when it's cold."
01:53;01:56;"That's kind of true. Not me."
01:56;01:59;"Yeah, well you have a thicker skin."
01:59;02:00;"That's right."
02:00;02:01;"I barely drive."
02:01;02:06;"I'm really excited about it. I'm wearing my New York, big New York coat around town."
02:06;02:07;"It's good luck."
02:07;02:12;"Going to have a hot coffee. Almost pretend that I'm back in New York here and there."
02:12;02:13;"I'm here."
02:13;02:14;"You're here?"
02:14;02:15;"It's like you're in New York."
02:15;02:18;"I got the president of TC East here."
02:18;02:20;"You know, slowly but surely, man."
02:20;02:22;"Man, we got so much to talk about."
02:22;02:25;"It's been an absolutely jam-packed last two weeks."
02:25;02:33;"Well, one thing that you guys noted as we came in is that you're both openers on the next Vampire Weekend Tour."
02:33;02:34;"That is true."
02:34;02:35;"Yeah."
02:35;02:39;"So we started talking about the tour a little bit, but we didn't go that deep."
02:39;02:41;"Now the tix have been on sale for a while."
02:41;02:49;"And I can talk more specifically about the bills because with both of you guys, you're not doing like full legs of the tour."
02:49;02:51;"Although that could be fun in the future."
02:51;02:53;"That'd be tight. Richard Pictures and Death Spot."
02:53;02:55;"You're kind of dangling the carrot here."
02:55;02:57;"Who plays first, though? That's tough."
02:57;02:59;"I guess we alternate at night to night."
02:59;03:00;"You're both busy guys."
03:00;03:02;"I mean, at least Death Spot is just one man."
03:02;03:04;"Richard Pictures is five men?"
03:04;03:06;"It's a seven-person band."
03:06;03:07;"Oh, it's a full seven?"
03:07;03:09;"It varies from five to seven."
03:09;03:11;"By the way, all seven are in for Chicago."
03:11;03:12;"Oh, really? Sick."
03:12;03:15;"Yeah, because when you guys were in the Novo."
03:15;03:16;"Oh, yeah, of course."
03:16;03:18;"At the Novo, that was a five-man jam."
03:18;03:21;"Yeah, Donna and Keith were out of town."
03:21;03:26;"And you guys are a little harder to wrangle also because, well, you're not full-time musicians."
03:26;03:28;"Not a professional band."
03:28;03:29;"Right."
03:29;03:31;"It is a hobby."
03:31;03:35;"I know, but it gets confusing with the dead because you have some Grateful Dead cover bands."
03:35;03:36;"That are pro, yeah."
03:36;03:40;"Like your Jay Rads, your Dead and Go's, who are pulling in."
03:40;03:42;"That's a full-time job."
03:42;03:47;"Some folks trust reason, others trust the mind"
03:47;03:52;"I don't trust nothing, but I know it'll come alright"
03:52;03:57;"Say it once again now, well, I hope you understand"
03:57;04:03;"When it's turnin' over, love matters just a man"
04:03;04:08;"Playin', playin' with the band"
04:08;04:13;"Can't break, can't break on the layup"
04:13;04:19;"Actually, today I was talking with our touring team, and somebody referenced the Pink Floyd light show."
04:19;04:24;"And then somebody was like, ""Well, have you seen the Australian Pink Floyd show?"""
04:24;04:25;"And I was like, ""What is that?"""
04:25;04:31;"And they're like, ""Well, they're based in the UK, but they're a bunch of Australian guys who started a Pink Floyd tribute band."""
04:31;04:32;"Sounds terrible."
04:32;04:33;"Oh, you're already hatin'?"
04:33;04:34;"They're Australian."
04:34;04:36;"Oh."
04:36;04:38;"We're not hatin' on Australia."
04:38;04:39;"I am."
04:39;04:40;"Alright, well, yeah, Deadspot."
04:40;04:42;"I got like three Australian friends."
04:42;04:44;"I feel like you got a lot of Australian friends."
04:44;04:45;"Three, maybe."
04:45;04:50;"So it's a touring Pink Floyd cover band and light show."
04:50;04:53;"Yeah, and so I was talking to this touring guy, and I was like,"
04:53;04:56;"'cause Pink Floyd was one of the biggest touring acts in the world."
04:56;05:00;"We've talked on the show that Roger Waters presents, you know, whatever."
05:00;05:03;"Those are some of the biggest, grossing tours of all time."
05:03;05:05;"We went to the Staples Center."
05:05;05:09;"I saw him at the Staples Center, so I'm like, ""So what's up with the Australian Pink Floyd show?"""
05:09;05:13;"And this guy--well, first of all, the fact that they're based in the UK is like, ""Okay, why?"""
05:13;05:17;"And it's partially because I think they're so hot, and Europe's such a big market for them,"
05:17;05:19;"they can't be flying from Australia all the time."
05:19;05:24;"So I was like, as any kind of professional musician has to say, ""What kind of rooms are these guys doing?"""
05:24;05:28;"And one person said, ""Well, last time I saw them, I think it was in Geneva."""
05:28;05:30;"And it was like--you know, they do like small arenas."
05:30;05:31;"Jesus Christ."
05:31;05:33;"And I was like, ""How many people are there in Geneva?"""
05:33;05:35;"And he was like, ""About 6,000."""
05:35;05:36;"Wow."
05:36;05:39;"And I was like, ""Wait, wait, wait. I know Pink Floyd is popular,"
05:39;05:45;"and I can totally imagine a successful Pink Floyd band that's covering--making it a full-time job."""
05:45;05:49;"But 5,000, that's bigger than Vampire Weekend."
05:49;05:50;"Most bands."
05:50;05:51;"Bigger than most bands."
05:51;05:52;"And I was like, ""What's special about them?"""
05:52;05:55;"And they were like, ""Well, you know, they're really good at playing Pink Floyd songs,"
05:55;05:58;"and they bring some Australian sense of humor."""
05:58;05:59;"And I was like, ""Like what?"""
05:59;06:04;"And they were like, ""If on their video screen they put up the dark side of the moon prism,"
06:04;06:09;"you know, instead of the triangle, it'll be like the shape of Australia."""
06:09;06:10;"That is rich."
06:10;06:11;"That is really funny stuff."
06:11;06:16;"And they were like, ""They'll recreate Pink Floyd album covers with Australian jokes in it."""
06:16;06:18;"And I was like, ""You know, fair play. I get it."
06:18;06:23;"If you're Australian and you love Pink Floyd, you're going to be making kind of inside jokes like that."""
06:23;06:24;"But again--"
06:24;06:25;"Is that a joke even?"
06:25;06:26;"It's a visual--"
06:26;06:28;"Technically it's a joke."
06:28;06:34;"But then they're playing at a 7,700 capacity arena in the Czech Republic."
06:34;06:37;"You're just like a Czech Pink Floyd fan."
06:37;06:39;"You're like into that Australian Pink Floyd-based humor."
06:39;06:40;"It just sounds so specific."
06:40;06:44;"Well, maybe you're starved for rock shows in Czech Republic."
06:44;06:45;"Maybe."
06:45;06:46;"Vampire's not going to Czech Republic."
06:46;06:47;"Yeah, no one else is doing it."
06:47;06:48;"I would."
06:48;06:49;"They don't want to see us."
06:49;06:50;"How do you guys sell that out?"
06:50;06:51;"That's 7,700 seats."
06:51;06:54;"Maybe we'll probably get an email from like the one hardcore TC head in the Czech Republic."
06:54;06:58;"Yeah, but what kind of attitude is that to say that they don't want to see you?"
06:58;06:59;"You're right."
06:59;07:03;"Australian Pink Floyd is like, ""We know they want us over there. We won't."
07:03;07:04;"They'll go anywhere."""
07:04;07:07;"Maybe I got to send the Australia Vampire Weekend band first."
07:07;07:08;"Yeah."
07:08;07:09;"To kind of play some seats."
07:09;07:10;"Test the waters, yeah."
07:10;07:15;"Actually, Vampire Weekend's never played in Eastern Europe, which is a real shame because, you know, I'm Eastern European."
07:15;07:17;"But we're going for the first time this summer."
07:17;07:19;"Maybe you want to come to that one."
07:19;07:20;"It's the motherland, Poland."
07:20;07:21;"I've never been there."
07:21;07:23;"You want to come to the festival in Poland?"
07:23;07:24;"Yeah, kind of."
07:24;07:27;"I can't get you an opening slot because it's a festival, but you can come."
07:27;07:28;"I'll just hang out, yeah."
07:28;07:30;"Oh, is your mom born in Poland?"
07:30;07:31;"Yeah."
07:31;07:32;"It'd be a fun mother-son trip."
07:32;07:33;"Doubt."
07:33;07:35;"My mom was trying to go back to Poland."
07:35;07:36;"She was there."
07:36;07:40;"It wasn't so good over there when she was there."
07:40;07:42;"Might be some bad memories for her."
07:42;07:43;"Oh, yeah, fair."
07:43;07:44;"Fair enough."
07:44;07:47;"But back to the U.S. concerts because that's where you guys are playing."
07:47;07:49;"We've painstakingly crafted these bills."
07:49;07:53;"So, Despot, you're playing the Madison Square Garden show."
07:53;07:54;"Yeah."
07:54;07:55;"Which is in September."
07:55;07:56;"Yes."
07:56;07:59;"And that's Despot, Angelique, Keejo, and Vampire Weekend."
07:59;08:00;"I think it's a very strong bill."
08:00;08:01;"Very excited about it."
08:01;08:02;"Me too."
08:02;08:03;"What are you going to do?"
08:03;08:05;"Is it just going to be you and a DJ?"
08:05;08:06;"I think so, yeah."
08:06;08:07;"I'm going to rap."
08:07;08:08;"All right."
08:08;08:09;"Yeah."
08:09;08:10;"So, everybody, I know it's in seven months."
08:10;08:11;"Get there early."
08:11;08:12;"It could just be me."
08:12;08:13;"I haven't really decided yet."
08:13;08:17;"Because when I tour, it's usually just me, and I always think that's really funny."
08:17;08:20;"And it's even funnier at Madison Square Garden."
08:20;08:22;"With like an early 2000s iPod?"
08:22;08:23;"iPad."
08:23;08:24;"iPad?"
08:24;08:25;"Yeah, I like to go iPad."
08:25;08:26;"I'm kind of into that."
08:26;08:27;"Yeah."
08:27;08:29;"With the nice little, you know, wire cable."
08:29;08:30;"That's going to be tight."
08:30;08:31;"Into some DI boxes."
08:31;08:33;"Yeah, maybe you've got to just lean into it."
08:33;08:34;"Yeah."
08:34;08:36;"Not trying to put on like a big laser light show."
08:36;08:37;"No, I'm going to do that too."
08:37;08:38;"Oh, really?"
08:38;08:39;"All right."
08:39;08:42;"I'm spending millions of dollars on this show."
08:42;08:43;"I mean, it's the garden."
08:43;08:44;"Yeah."
08:44;08:45;"Legendary venue."
08:45;08:46;"Once in a lifetime."
08:46;08:48;"Because I think I'm going to die this year."
08:48;08:49;"Oh, no."
08:49;08:50;"But not before September?"
08:50;08:51;"After the show, yeah."
08:51;08:52;"All right."
08:52;08:53;"Maybe that night."
08:53;08:54;"All right."
08:54;08:55;"Yeah."
08:55;08:56;"Maybe on stage."
08:56;08:57;"Oh, no."
08:57;08:58;"Then they're going to have to like clear it out, and then we won't get to play."
08:58;08:59;"That's really disrespectful."
08:59;09:00;"You'll still get to play."
09:00;09:01;"They won't care."
09:01;09:02;"Oh, no."
09:02;09:03;"They'll shut it down."
09:03;09:05;"No, Madison Square Garden is like, it's like the mob."
09:05;09:06;"The show must go on?"
09:06;09:09;"I bet they have a place in there where they put the bodies."
09:09;09:11;"There actually could be some bodies in there."
09:11;09:12;"Yeah."
09:13;09:14;"Anyway, the..."
09:14;09:15;"Damn, guys."
09:15;09:17;"Let's lighten the mood a little bit."
09:17;09:18;"So we're really excited."
09:18;09:19;"So we're real excited."
09:19;09:24;"The one thing about that show that I'm excited about is we normally don't like to play arenas"
09:24;09:25;"too much."
09:25;09:28;"And in fact, on the last album, we played a few here and there, and I was kind of like,"
09:28;09:29;"this just feels weird."
09:29;09:32;"But the garden, you make a special exception for."
09:32;09:34;"It's like right in the heart of town."
09:34;09:35;"Yeah."
09:35;09:36;"It's cozy."
09:36;09:37;"It's kind of the best one."
09:37;09:41;"I don't know that much about arenas, and we're definitely not trying to play too many."
09:41;09:46;"But apparently in arenas, it's all about the angle of the audience."
09:46;09:51;"So you can do like a 180 show or you could do a 270 show or you could do a 360."
09:51;09:52;"Oh, wow."
09:52;09:56;"Because you can picture like a typical show, the stage is back at like kind of like one"
09:56;09:57;"of the baskets."
09:57;09:58;"Right, right."
09:58;10:01;"But we kind of, you know, I don't like handle all this stuff."
10:01;10:04;"I have to check out a little bit with some of the touring stuff because it's like so"
10:04;10:05;"hardcore."
10:05;10:06;"Yeah."
10:06;10:07;"But our touring dudes were like, well, we'll put it up."
10:07;10:08;"We'll see how it does."
10:08;10:11;"And if there's a strong demand, we can go 360."
10:11;10:13;"And I was like, oh, so what's that like?"
10:13;10:17;"And they're like showing me pictures of like Pearl Jam and Bruce doing 360 at the garden,"
10:17;10:20;"which basically means you just sell the tickets behind the stage."
10:20;10:21;"Non-rotating stage."
10:22;10:25;"So in one sense, they're not good tickets."
10:25;10:28;"They're significantly cheaper because they're like obstructed."
10:28;10:32;"But it's also just kind of like a better vibe because then like everybody's looking at"
10:32;10:33;"each other."
10:33;10:36;"You know, you get that full like 360 round the room energy."
10:36;10:37;"Wow."
10:37;10:39;"Is there any way you could play to those people?"
10:39;10:44;"Can you like turn around and run to the other side of whatever type of curtain is there?"
10:44;10:45;"I think you can."
10:45;10:46;"Because I'm going to do that."
10:46;10:47;"You could turn around a little bit."
10:47;10:48;"Yeah."
10:48;10:52;"Especially you because maybe you get a headset mic so you can really work the back."
10:52;10:53;"Definitely."
10:53;10:56;"The 180 tickets because those are like the quote unquote good seats went real quick."
10:56;10:57;"Yeah."
10:57;10:59;"But now they're selling the ones like behind."
10:59;11:00;"To MSG."
11:00;11:01;"Yeah."
11:01;11:02;"Wow."
11:02;11:04;"So we're doing full 360 there, but it's like those ones go a little slower, but they're"
11:04;11:05;"cheap."
11:05;11:09;"So it's kind of like if you got the right attitude, I think you roll up there and you're"
11:09;11:10;"like, you know what?"
11:10;11:11;"We're not going to be seeing all the action."
11:11;11:15;"We're just going to feel the energy of the room of the room."
11:15;11:16;"Bounce and bruise."
11:16;11:17;"Yeah."
11:17;11:19;"If I was going to this show, that's where I'd sit."
11:19;11:20;"Yeah, for sure."
11:20;11:23;"If they were saying you could sit for free anywhere you want, you're going to go there."
11:23;11:26;"It's like sitting in the bleachers of a Yankee game."
11:26;11:27;"Yeah."
11:27;11:29;"I mean, in some ways, a little vibe."
11:29;11:30;"Yeah."
11:30;11:32;"Sometimes you want to sit front row, but that's also like super intense."
11:32;11:34;"You can just kind of sit in the back."
11:34;11:35;"It's like, you know what?"
11:35;11:36;"I'd sit in the back."
11:36;11:37;"Yeah."
11:37;11:38;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
11:38;11:39;"Yeah."
11:39;11:40;"I think that's a great way to feel the energy."
11:40;11:41;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
11:44;11:45;"Yeah."
11:46;11:47;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
11:53;12:16;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
12:16;12:45;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
12:45;12:46;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
13:00;13:21;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
13:21;13:50;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
13:50;13:51;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
14:05;14:26;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
14:26;14:47;"I think that's the best way to feel the energy."
14:47;14:51;"But then also at the Chicago show, that's the one that Richard Pictures are playing"
14:51;14:52;"at."
14:52;14:53;"Yeah."
14:53;14:54;"I'm excited about all the shows."
14:54;14:59;"Of course, these are cities we've played a lot, so New York's very dear to my heart."
14:59;15:02;"And then Chicago I'm psyched about because it's on Father's Day."
15:02;15:04;"I haven't hyped that up too much."
15:04;15:08;"I was like, let the people of Chicago decide if they want to go to the show."
15:08;15:12;"But part of the reason that I asked Richard Pictures to come to that one, you guys are"
15:12;15:13;"playing Hollywood Bowl, makes sense."
15:13;15:14;"You live in LA."
15:14;15:16;"It makes total sense for us to play the Hollywood Bowl."
15:16;15:18;"Makes a lot of sense."
15:18;15:23;"But then in Chicago, I was kind of disappointed because last year on Father's Day weekend,"
15:23;15:27;"we did the Ojai shows, which I think was a great kickoff."
15:27;15:28;"Tremendous weekend."
15:28;15:31;"That was a great weekend, legendary weekend."
15:31;15:34;"And then I was kind of bummed to be like, well, the album's going to come out in the"
15:34;15:38;"spring and then we can't really just drop everything, go back to Ojai."
15:38;15:41;"But then it turned out like, oh, we're playing in Chicago and it's going to be like a sick"
15:41;15:42;"outdoor show."
15:42;15:43;"So you guys are coming through."
15:43;15:46;"We also got Chicano Batman who's opening that leg for us."
15:46;15:47;"That's going to roll."
15:47;15:48;"So that's going to roll."
15:48;15:51;"And we can, I mean, I'm excited about the music, but I'm also very excited that we can"
15:51;15:54;"bring back the legendary Father's Day weekend t-shirt."
15:54;15:55;"Oh yeah."
15:55;15:56;"The long sleeve."
15:56;15:57;"Oh yeah."
15:57;15:58;"Which Jake rocks."
15:58;15:59;"Version two."
15:59;16:00;"Often."
16:00;16:01;"Oh, all the time."
16:01;16:03;"For people who don't know, this is, I think this is the closest thing to a Vampire Weekend"
16:03;16:04;"grail."
16:04;16:05;"Yeah, I think it's the best shirt."
16:05;16:06;"It's probably our best shirt."
16:06;16:07;"Yeah."
16:07;16:11;"It's a long sleeve t-shirt and in the Vampire Weekend Futura bold font, it says Father's"
16:11;16:12;"Day weekend."
16:12;16:14;"And then there's a big frog and a little frog on a branch."
16:14;16:16;"It's just a real classic shirt."
16:16;16:17;"I didn't get one."
16:17;16:18;"I have a couple."
16:18;16:19;"All right, cool."
16:19;16:22;"That one also, it sold out very quickly at Ojai."
16:22;16:26;"Is that like an afternoon show in Chicago or what's the deal?"
16:26;16:27;"Evening?"
16:27;16:28;"It's at night."
16:28;16:29;"Yeah, it probably starts like early evening."
16:29;16:30;"Okay, cool."
16:30;16:33;"So it'll probably be like, you know, sun will be up and then we'll go down halfway through."
16:33;16:34;"Nice."
16:34;16:37;"So anyway, I'm excited that we can bring back that shirt for Chicago."
16:37;16:38;"That's going to be very special."
16:38;16:40;"But in Chicago, there's like a similar thing."
16:40;16:45;"In the last few weeks, I've, I really haven't thought about like venues and tickets in years."
16:45;16:46;"Yeah."
16:46;16:50;"So I'm kind of like really dip back in people like keeping me updated on some of this stuff."
16:50;16:53;"And in Chicago, it's in a place called Northerly Island."
16:53;16:54;"I've never been there."
16:54;16:56;"I guess it's kind of like on the lake."
16:56;16:57;"Cool."
16:57;17:01;"And then there's like this kind of like terrace seated amphitheater vibe."
17:01;17:04;"So I think more or less all the tickets are sold out for like the seats."
17:04;17:07;"But then there's this like endless lawn in the back."
17:07;17:10;"So now they're selling like these kind of relatively cheap lawn tickets."
17:10;17:11;"Yeah."
17:11;17:15;"I think if you're asking people to come just like hang super far back on the lawn, you"
17:15;17:17;"really got to provide a good atmosphere."
17:17;17:18;"You rolling at dusk."
17:18;17:20;"We're doing like a 10 minute bird song."
17:20;17:21;"Yeah."
17:21;17:22;"Well, that's going to be a good atmosphere."
17:22;17:23;"That's a chill."
17:23;17:24;"That's a soft landing."
17:24;17:27;"But I feel like at the show, that is, that's going to be a good vibe."
17:28;17:34;"Oh, I know a song like a bird within her sing."
17:34;17:48;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
17:54;18:02;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
18:02;18:08;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
18:44;18:48;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
18:48;18:54;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
19:12;19:16;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
19:16;19:22;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
19:40;19:44;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
19:44;19:50;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
20:08;20:12;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
20:12;20:18;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
20:36;20:40;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
20:40;20:46;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
21:04;21:08;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
21:08;21:14;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
21:32;21:36;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
21:36;21:42;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
22:00;22:04;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
22:04;22:10;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
22:28;22:32;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
22:32;22:38;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
22:56;23:00;"Oh, I know she'll sing a little while and then through all."
23:00;23:26;"[Instrumental]"
23:26;23:32;"2021, what do you think about me? I could wait a year but I couldn't wait three."
23:32;23:38;"Boy, I don't wanna be. Boy."
23:38;23:45;"2021, what do you think about us? Copper goes clear, steel beams go loose."
23:45;23:50;"Boy, it's a matter of. Boy."
23:50;24:01;"Oh yeah, okay, there was some thing. Oh, here we go. In 2009, there was some story that there was a Craigslist ad about a Vampire Weekend cover band."
24:01;24:06;"And it kind of just seemed like a weird joke, but somebody was like, I want to start a Vampire Weekend cover band."
24:06;24:12;"It's going to be called the VW Bugs. And then I guess there was an interview where they tracked down the person who started it."
24:12;24:19;"Wow. A woman named Catherine. And she said the group existed and they were practicing, recording and planning gigs and will be the subject of a web-based documentary."
24:19;24:24;"So you got to keep in mind, this is, we only had one album out. This is 10 years ago. At the time."
24:24;24:29;"And I guess they had a MySpace. Is there music on it? I wonder if they gigged. I don't think so."
24:29;24:36;"I think it was just like a weird joke. And I think also like on the internet in 2009, something like this could get a little more traction."
24:36;24:41;"Today, that would just be like a tweet. Somebody would be like, wouldn't it be funny to start a Vampire Weekend cover band?"
24:41;24:48;"Right. There was no outlet for that back then. Right. This is like you saw something on Craigslist and you're like, I'm going to write an article about this."
24:48;24:57;"Okay, wait, then they got more into it. In this post 9/11 internet age we live in, it's possible for the tribute band to usurp the power of the band to which they are paying tribute."
24:57;25:06;"Okay. What? 9/11? The younger generation has grown used to not paying for intellectual property and in so doing respects it less."
25:06;25:12;"In this way, the Vampire Weekend tribute band is a sort of thought experiment on the inherent morality of the internet and what meritocracy is."
25:12;25:20;"This is garbage. Where was this article? Cover bands predate the internet. I don't want to say it, but it's kind of Borghesean."
25:20;25:28;"It's pretty Borghesean. Dude, imagine a Greta Van Fleet cover band. Oh, that's sick."
25:28;25:34;"Do we need Zeppelin covers? Wait, what? That's sick. Or even just like Page and Plant busting out a Greta Van Fleet song."
25:34;25:43;"Oh, that would be really sick. I guarantee that somebody at the Grammys floated the idea of Greta Van Fleet teaming up with Page and Plant at the Grammys."
25:43;25:49;"Right. Page was in. Plant declined. Yeah, seriously. Oh my God. No, but a Greta Van Fleet cover band is a sick idea."
25:49;25:55;"Maybe that's my next project. Did they play at the Grammys? I didn't watch the Grammys. No, they won a Grammy though."
25:55;26:01;"Best rock album. Best rock album. But they didn't win Best New Artist, which for people who remember. That was disgust."
26:01;26:06;"Who won that? Oh, you guys did all this already. It's all good. Well, yeah, this happened a couple weeks ago."
26:06;26:12;"But we were saying before that Greta Van Fleet could not win Best New Artist, even though we respect their postmodern playfulness."
26:12;26:18;"If Greta Van Fleet won Best New Artist, it would be a bad look for rock because my whole thing is that rock needs to be humble."
26:18;26:24;"But then Best New Rock, would they win? Band? Best New Rock album. No, it was Best Rock Album."
26:24;26:30;"Best Rock Album. So isn't that almost even worse? Because then it's like targeted. It's rock."
26:30;26:33;"No, but I'm saying like, I don't like when people hate on them because it's like, whatever."
26:33;26:39;"These guys love Led Zeppelin and they're doing their thing and they love the old world and, you know, they're having fun."
26:39;26:47;"What's like a thing that in music, a band or even just an idea that you like when people hate on?"
26:47;26:53;"Great question. Wait, what's something in music that. That you agree with. That me?"
26:53;26:58;"That hateration on. Oh. Because you're really diplomatic. I'm very diplomatic and positive."
26:58;27:02;"Which I guess I appreciate because I'm the opposite maybe."
27:02;27:06;"I only like dislike artists if like I know proof positive that they're like an ass."
27:06;27:11;"But even then, that's not about being an artist. That's about a human thing. It actually has nothing to do with their art."
27:11;27:17;"Slippery slope here. Yeah, it's a slippery slope. But no, just somebody who like people say their music sucks and I'm like, yeah, that sucks."
27:17;27:26;"And you're like, yeah, it does suck. Yeah. I bet it's nobody. Yeah, kind of nobody. I mean, the, you know, I've got my opinions."
27:26;27:30;"It's one thing to have your opinion when you're just shooting this with you guys."
27:30;27:36;"Yeah. But it's another thing to be like, I want to go out and hurt this person's feelings."
27:36;27:41;"Right. Like go go write a review that's really cruel to Greta Van Fleet or leave a mean comment."
27:41;27:49;"This is me being mean to you and anyone who you might have mentioned. So you're not going to do it."
27:49;27:55;"I'm just trying to think like, you know, when I watched the Grammys, I didn't particularly enjoy the whole show."
27:55;28:01;"But I didn't really like see anything that one where I was like it all like more or less made sense to me."
28:01;28:04;"Yeah. Sometimes I was like, that's not what I would have picked, but whatever."
28:04;28:08;"And as we discussed, I was unfairly locked out of Grammy voting."
28:08;28:13;"Somebody pointed out that there was a tie in one category. I could have been the tiebreaker."
28:13;28:16;"What was the best traditional R&B performance?"
28:16;28:22;"That was a tie between Leon Bridges and PJ Morton featuring Yeba. Also best rap performance."
28:22;28:26;"It was a tie between Kings Dead and Bubba Lynn Bubba Lynn's by Anderson ."
28:26;28:30;"Pack and Kings that is Kendrick and James Blake and all sorts of people."
28:30;28:32;"Who are you voting for? I think I might have never heard either."
28:32;28:39;"Ezra didn't vote. Alec, if you don't know, the last day of voting, Grammy voting eligibility or whatever,"
28:39;28:44;"I went on the website and it was the day and they had already closed voting."
28:44;28:49;"Probably only for you. It's possible. Yeah. Too diplomatic. I was too diplomatic."
28:49;28:52;"OK, best rap performance. The choices were Be Careful by Cardi B."
28:52;28:57;"Nice for what? Drake, Kings Dead, Kendrick J-Rock, Future James Blake, Bubba Lynn, Anderson ."
28:57;29:00;"Pack, Sicko Mode, Travis Scott. I would have gone Sicko Mode."
29:00;29:04;"I mean, Sicko Mode is kind of undeniably the best rap performance of those."
29:04;29:09;"Yeah, but I might have voted for Cardi B just because I want to see Cardi B win."
29:09;29:13;"Yeah, that would have felt better. And Cardi B did win Best Rap Album. So that's cool."
29:13;29:18;"Yeah, that is cool. I wanted her to win Album of the Year. That didn't happen, but it's all right."
29:18;29:21;"Who won Album of the Year? Kacey Musgraves. And I like Kacey Musgraves."
29:21;29:25;"I'm a fan, but it would have been cool for Cardi B to win it. First album."
29:25;29:30;"Do you know either of the two that were tied? No, I don't know that Anderson . Pack song."
29:30;29:33;"Me neither. I might have voted for Kings Dead just because I'm so diplomatic."
29:33;29:38;"And I'd say if I vote for Bubba Lynn, Anderson . Pack wins a Grammy."
29:38;29:43;"If I vote for Kings Dead, I'd be giving one to Kendrick, J-Rock, Future and James Blake."
29:43;29:47;"Yeah, everybody eats. That's right. So that's kind of one of those moral questions."
29:47;29:52;"If you could feed one man or feed four men. Is that the song from Black Panther?"
29:52;29:56;"Yeah, Kings Dead is one of the songs from Black Panther. Tight song. I don't know."
29:56;30:00;"Should we listen to it? I feel like we should listen to both."
30:00;30:04;"Hopefully it's the same song I'm thinking of. You're hearing it here first, folks."
30:04;30:08;"Two weeks after the Grammys, we finally decide if I voted."
30:08;30:12;"Remember there was that OJ Simpson wrote the book that never came out called If I Did It?"
30:12;30:19;"Yeah. This is my book. If I voted in the 2019 Grammys, I could have changed history."
30:20;30:25;"Miss me with that bush. You ain't really wild. You're a tourist."
30:25;30:31;"I be black and now with the purist. I made a hundred thousand. I freaked it."
30:31;30:33;"I made five hundred thousand. I freaked it."
30:33;30:36;"You know, his first line was missing me with the bush."
30:36;30:45;"And I have a really good idea for a female rapper that involves that phrase missing me with the bush."
30:45;30:50;"His first line was Miss me with the bush. I want a female rapper."
30:50;30:56;"Her name is Miss Me, Ms. Me. And her first single is with the bush."
30:56;31:00;"That's cool. Come on. That's good. Someone got to do it."
31:00;31:03;"And Miss Me is just kind of a good name. Yeah, Miss Me. That works."
31:03;31:08;"All right. I get it. Yeah, that song is sick. It's pretty good."
31:08;31:12;"We didn't hear James Blake's part. I don't think."
31:12;31:17;"You never know. Definitely never heard this."
31:17;31:21;"I think I maybe heard Kings Dead for a second in a Uber or something."
31:21;31:29;"Was that the same sample as Britney? Oh, Toxic? Yeah, could be."
31:41;31:49;"This is Kendrick again. Similar flow."
31:49;31:58;"It's close. It's probably just some other Bollywood."
31:58;32:02;"Yeah, they're both referencing Bollywood strings."
32:02;32:07;"If I'm honest, I wouldn't have affected the category because those are both good songs."
32:07;32:11;"Sicko mode, man. I would have voted for Sicko Mode or Cardi B."
32:11;32:15;"Sicko Mode is a good song. Yeah, Sicko Mode is pretty undeniable."
32:15;32:19;"I mean, it's funny. In some categories, popularity shouldn't matter."
32:19;32:26;"But then it is weird when just a generally beloved hit song like Sicko Mode is not honored."
32:26;32:33;"Yeah, this song is a good song. And also Sicko Mode is three songs in one."
32:33;32:37;"That's true. Do you know this song, Jake? I don't think so. Is this Sicko Mode? Yeah."
32:37;32:41;"Good title. Yeah, right?"
32:41;32:44;"Yeah, this is amazing. It's never been in the top five for us."
32:44;32:47;"This is like one of the biggest songs of the year."
33:00;33:06;"That's an ominous part. While the cover of that single is tie-dye."
33:06;33:11;"It's a mix of hippie and some black metal funk."
33:11;33:21;"So the first minute is this vibe. And then..."
33:21;33:26;"Oh, not yet. It's coming."
33:27;33:34;"Yo, did you hear? Somebody remade this out of all Animal Crossing sounds."
33:34;33:38;"It's sick. They remade the beat with Animal Crossing sounds."
33:38;33:41;"And they did the vocals with little Animal Crossing sounds."
33:41;33:43;"So it's like..."
33:43;33:52;"It's sick. That's my favorite song, actually, of 2018. Sicko Mode, Animal Crossing."
33:55;33:57;"Hell yeah."
33:57;34:15;"This might be eligible for the Grammys next year. Yeah."
34:30;34:34;"What do you mean Animal Crossing? It's a video game."
34:34;34:40;"That people play on Facebook a lot or Nintendo DS."
34:49;34:51;"It's really good."
34:51;35:00;"I don't know, man. It kind of sounds for babies, if I'm honest."
35:00;35:02;"There you go. Honest opinion."
35:02;35:04;"Yeah, you know, I don't like to talk... I don't like to talk..."
35:04;35:07;"It's the first time you ever hated on anything."
35:07;35:10;"Because any artist that's out there sticking their neck out, I respect."
35:10;35:14;"The artist in this case. I don't know the names of the characters in Animal Crossing."
35:14;35:17;"I'm not hating. I'm just saying it kind of sounds like it's for babies."
35:17;35:20;"Well, Sicko Mode doesn't sound like it's for babies?"
35:20;35:22;"No, it sounds like it's for adults. Interesting."
35:22;35:25;"I just think because Sicko Mode, you actually can hear the words and stuff."
35:25;35:28;"And this is like... You know, it's like... What is that?"
35:28;35:31;"It suggests... You know the words already."
35:31;35:33;"Yeah, I guess you have a point. Maybe this one's for adults, actually."
35:33;35:37;"It's very sophisticated because it's assuming you know the words."
35:37;35:39;"Fair point. It is kind of Borghese in a way."
35:39;35:43;"Anyway, we got a lot of Patrick World songs. I don't think you've heard any of them yet."
35:43;35:47;"I haven't. For some reason, SoundCloud doesn't work on my phone."
35:47;35:48;"Do you have the app?"
35:48;35:50;"No, I don't have..."
35:50;35:52;"When you play it off the browser on the phone, it's weird."
35:52;35:53;"Yeah, it's just..."
35:53;35:54;"Because it's a widget."
35:54;35:55;"Yeah, it's really annoying."
35:55;35:56;"I don't know what that means."
35:56;35:58;"So let's check it out. This is a friend of the show, Patrick World,"
35:58;36:01;"who's blessed us with so many great songs."
36:01;36:03;"And he made one specifically for Jake's birthday."
36:03;36:04;"Right."
36:04;36:07;"It's called ""Shallow Birthday."" I think I know where this is heading."
36:07;36:08;"Is that what it's called?"
36:08;36:09;"""Shallow Birthday."""
36:09;36:12;"Tell me something, Jake."
36:12;36:13;"Wow."
36:13;36:18;"Did you enjoy some tasty birthday cake?"
36:18;36:23;"I know I missed the date."
36:23;36:28;"Classic TC, this is three weeks late."

38:34;38:38;"You didn't change your calendar."
38:38;38:42;"Flip it over and see."
38:42;38:45;"It's 2019 2019 2019, baby."
38:45;38:46;"It's 2019."
38:46;38:49;"It's 2019 2019 2019, baby."
38:49;38:52;"This guy has an opening slot on one of those shows."
38:52;38:54;"We could bring him up in Montreal."
38:54;38:55;"I think we're gonna have to."
38:55;38:58;"He really nailed my impression of Florida Georgia line."
38:58;38:59;"Actually, hold on."
38:59;39:01;"I forgot to tell you guys this."
39:01;39:02;"This is crazy."
39:02;39:04;"Florida Georgia line is opening for Vampire?"
39:04;39:06;"No, you're opening for Florida Georgia line."
39:06;39:07;"You're in Florida Georgia line."
39:07;39:10;"There's this thing before the Grammys called the Clive Davis dinner."
39:10;39:12;"Is he the guy that manages Metallica?"
39:12;39:14;"No, that's Cliff Bernstein."
39:14;39:15;"Okay."
39:15;39:16;"Clive Davis."
39:16;39:20;"Clive Davis ran Arista Records and he is like instrumental in the careers of like Whitney"
39:20;39:23;"Houston or Reetha, you know, just like a legendary guy."
39:23;39:28;"And so he throws this thing that's like this kind of famous night before the Grammys dinner"
39:28;39:29;"party thing."
39:29;39:31;"I almost went once."
39:31;39:32;"Oh, did you?"
39:32;39:33;"But I didn't."
39:33;39:34;"It's interesting."
39:34;39:35;"It's at the..."
39:35;39:36;"I wasn't invited or anything."
39:36;39:39;"It's in the same place where they have the Golden Globes, the Beverly Hilton."
39:39;39:40;"Okay."
39:40;39:41;"I'd never been before."
39:41;39:43;"And my manager said, you want to come?"
39:43;39:44;"And I was like, yeah, sure."
39:44;39:48;"And you know, so we go there as a showbiz professional, I know at least a handful of"
39:48;39:51;"people and there's all sorts of random people."
39:51;39:52;"Our boss, Tim Cook was there."
39:52;39:53;"Did you meet him?"
39:53;39:54;"No, I didn't meet him."
39:54;39:55;"David Hockney was there."
39:55;39:56;"Wow."
39:56;39:57;"It was like a real who's who."
39:57;39:59;"Did you say hi to Hockney?"
39:59;40:00;"No."
40:00;40:03;"Did you recognize him or someone was like, that's David Hockney?"
40:03;40:05;"A bunch of people were like, we're going to go say hi to David Hockney."
40:05;40:08;"Why the hell is David Hockney at the pre Grammys dinner?"
40:08;40:09;"It's in California, right?"
40:09;40:10;"Yes, he's a California guy."
40:10;40:11;"He's a California guy."
40:11;40:15;"Yeah, I'm aware he's a prominent Los Angeles artist."
40:15;40:17;"There were like guys from the Superbowl there."
40:17;40:18;"Wow."
40:18;40:20;"Maybe he painted the party."
40:20;40:21;"Yeah."
40:21;40:24;"All like the old school music biz legends."
40:24;40:25;"Rashida's dad was there."
40:25;40:26;"Kind of funny."
40:26;40:27;"Just like running."
40:27;40:28;"The Hockney just blew my mind."
40:28;40:29;"But anyway, Joey Mitchell was there."
40:29;40:30;"That is weird."
40:30;40:31;"Really?"
40:31;40:32;"Did you say hi to her?"
40:32;40:33;"No, I don't know them."
40:33;40:34;"Wait, did you say hi?"
40:34;40:35;"Joey, big fan."
40:35;40:37;"Are you leading up to who you did say hi to?"
40:37;40:38;"Okay."
40:38;40:40;"No, I mean, I saw people who like work at the label."
40:40;40:45;"But did you say hi to anyone that we would be like, ""Oh, he said hi to him or her?"""
40:45;40:47;"We go and there's kind of like this like intense energy."
40:47;40:49;"There's like a lot of security to get through."
40:49;40:50;"Sure."
40:50;40:51;"I mean, Hockney's there."
40:51;40:52;"Yeah, Hockney's there."
40:52;40:53;"Did he bring a painting?"
40:53;40:55;"No, but he was dressed like an artist."
40:55;40:56;"Other people are more conservative."
40:56;40:57;"He had like a cool hat on?"
40:57;40:58;"He had like a cool suit."
40:58;40:59;"Like really colorful or just like an interesting shape?"
40:59;41:00;"Yeah, kind of colorful."
41:00;41:01;"No colorful."
41:01;41:06;"So you smoked a bowl with Hockney and Joey Mitchell?"
41:06;41:07;"Oh yeah."
41:07;41:10;"No, and I see at a distance, ""Oh, there's Diplo."""
41:10;41:12;"And all the usual suspects."
41:12;41:14;"You say hi to him?"
41:14;41:15;"That's not interesting."
41:15;41:16;"No."
41:16;41:18;"No, I said hi to people from the label."
41:18;41:20;"I said hi to Rashida's dad and stuff."
41:20;41:22;"So there's all this schmoozing."
41:22;41:23;"Then they start serving dinner."
41:23;41:25;"So you're like, ""Get to your seat."""
41:25;41:28;"So then I go with my manager and I'm sort of like plus one vibe."
41:28;41:29;"I'm along for the ride."
41:29;41:30;"Assigned seating."
41:30;41:31;"It's assigned seating."
41:31;41:32;"Yeah."
41:32;41:35;"So we sit down at our table and there's only two seats left."
41:35;41:40;"So we squeeze right in those seats and I look around and there's a bunch of guys and then"
41:40;41:45;"there's a somewhat younger woman and there's some older people and me and my manager just"
41:45;41:47;"pop down and I'm just kind of like, ""All right."
41:47;41:49;"Well, I don't know anybody at our table."""
41:49;41:50;"You know, it's like being at a wedding or something."
41:50;41:51;"Sure, sure."
41:51;41:53;"You're kind of like, ""I don't know anybody at our table."""
41:53;41:55;"And then I sit down and the guy next to me is very nice."
41:55;41:59;"I really appreciate this because at the end of the day, I'm kind of a shy person."
41:59;42:03;"Or I'm more just like, you know, in public, don't bother people."
42:03;42:05;"If they want to talk, they'll talk to you."
42:05;42:08;"But that can also sometimes you're the person who should be saying, ""Hi."""
42:08;42:11;"You know, it's always hard to know, you know, are you being weird by not saying hi?"
42:11;42:14;"But anyway, it's always nice I think when you sit down at some kind of bizarre event"
42:14;42:17;"like that and the person next to you just introduces themselves."
42:17;42:18;"Yep."
42:18;42:19;"And just gets it going."
42:19;42:20;"Out of the gate."
42:20;42:21;"Yeah."
42:21;42:25;"So then this guy, you know, a little bit older than me just kind of turns to me and says,"
42:25;42:28;"""Hey man, what do you have to do with all this going on?"""
42:28;42:29;"And I was like, ""Oh, I'm a musician."""
42:29;42:30;"And he's like, ""Oh, that's cool."""
42:30;42:31;"He's like, ""What kind of music?"""
42:31;42:35;"And I'm like, ""Well, I'm in a band called Vampire Weekend."""
42:35;42:37;"And he goes, ""Oh, that's interesting."
42:37;42:38;"Let me guess, alternative?"""
42:38;42:40;"And I was like, ""Guilty as charged."""
42:40;42:43;"And I was like, ""What's your deal?"" or whatever."
42:43;42:44;"And he's like, ""Well, my name's Chief."""
42:44;42:45;"And I was already like, ""Sick."""
42:45;42:46;"Chief Keef."
42:46;42:47;"Yeah, it was Chief Keef."
42:47;42:50;"This guy's friendly and his name's Chief."
42:50;42:53;"I already just get a great vibe off this dude."
42:53;42:54;"And I say, ""Well, how about you, Chief?"""
42:54;42:57;"And he's like, ""Well, me and this guy to my left manage these guys."
42:57;43:00;"And then there's two more guys, but they're on the other side of the table."
43:00;43:02;"They're a country duo called Florida Georgia Line."""
43:02;43:05;"Well, then I realized I didn't know what Florida Georgia Line really looked like."
43:05;43:08;"And then I kind of look at them and I'm like, ""Yo, whoa, I'm two seats away from Florida"
43:08;43:09;"Georgia Line."""
43:09;43:10;"And I'm very familiar with their catalog."
43:10;43:11;"I'm very familiar."
43:11;43:12;"Well, at least a few songs."
43:12;43:13;"Yeah."
43:13;43:14;"I'm a little bit starstruck."
43:14;43:16;"And I start chopping it up with Chief."
43:16;43:17;"Super nice guy."
43:17;43:19;"And we just start talking a little bit."
43:19;43:21;"And I asked him where he was from."
43:21;43:22;"He says, ""Vancouver."""
43:22;43:23;"And I was like, I was so curious about this."
43:23;43:25;"And I was like, ""Vancouver?"
43:25;43:27;"That's got to be kind of rare in country music."""
43:27;43:31;"Because they're based in Nashville now, at least partially."
43:31;43:34;"And I was like, ""Man, how do you end up going from Vancouver to Nashville?"""
43:34;43:39;"And then he told me that for years, he was a longtime tour manager of Nickelback, which"
43:39;43:40;"makes sense."
43:40;43:41;"Nickelback's Canadian."
43:41;43:42;"Potbeckins."
43:42;43:46;"So now I'm fascinated because I never knew there was a Nickelback FGL connection."
43:46;43:48;"It makes a lot of sense aesthetically."
43:48;43:49;"It kind of does make sense."
43:49;43:52;"Oh, and also another thing that's interesting is in the music industry, and I was also pretty"
43:52;43:57;"impressed by this, is that it's very rare to go from being a tour manager to a manager."
43:57;44:00;"If you work in live music, you often tend to work in live music your whole life."
44:00;44:05;"If you're a really good tour manager for a huge band like Nickelback, you might just"
44:05;44:06;"do that for the rest of your life."
44:06;44:11;"There's these old school tour managers, very well paid, because they're running a small"
44:11;44:12;"army across the world."
44:12;44:14;"So it's not a classic transition."
44:14;44:18;"So you have to really have some drive, some ambition, some insight to do it."
44:18;44:20;"And I'm like, ""How does that transition work?"
44:20;44:21;"I've never heard of that."""
44:21;44:22;"And then I looked it up."
44:22;44:23;"This is public information."
44:23;44:25;"He got to know Nickelback's main producer."
44:25;44:29;"So he starts managing the producer, dipping his toes into the management world."
44:29;44:34;"And then at some point, Nickelback's producer is looking to find some new artists to work"
44:34;44:38;"with and at a state fair or something, he comes across these two guys who turn out to"
44:38;44:40;"be Florida Georgia Line."
44:40;44:42;"And this guy's immediately like, ""Well, these guys are sick."
44:42;44:43;"They start working again."""
44:43;44:47;"So I didn't realize that there's a producer and management connection between Nickelback"
44:47;44:53;"and Florida Georgia Line and this guy Chief and his partner, whose name I don't remember,"
44:53;44:54;"unfortunately."
44:54;44:58;"They saw these two dudes and they immediately saw star potential and they started managing"
44:58;44:59;"them."
44:59;45:01;"And now Florida Georgia Line is truly massive."
45:01;45:05;"Was this in Florida and/or Georgia that they caught this state fair gig?"
45:05;45:06;"That's unclear to me."
45:06;45:08;"But it was truly that random?"
45:08;45:10;"Well, it was a little random, but it was via the producer."
45:10;45:14;"But anyway, there's this whole interesting Nickelback, Florida Georgia Line connection."
45:14;45:15;"So already I'm stunned."
45:15;45:19;"And it's also just an interesting music industry connection."
45:19;45:23;"And the Florida Georgia Line guys, I didn't really get to jawbone with them."
45:23;45:26;"And they were also there with their wives or girlfriends, but they seemed like they"
45:26;45:27;"were just having a great time."
45:27;45:29;"They seemed like kind of chill dudes."
45:29;45:33;"Then my manager's to my right and he's striking up a conversation with like a very elegant"
45:33;45:34;"older man."
45:34;45:35;"So he brings me into that conversation."
45:35;45:37;"He goes, ""Well, Ezra's from New Jersey."""
45:37;45:38;"And this guy's talking about how he does some work in New Jersey."
45:38;45:39;"And I'm like, ""Where are you from?"""
45:39;45:41;"And he's like, ""Well, you know, I live on Staten Island."""
45:41;45:43;"And I'm kind of like, ""Oh, that's cool."
45:43;45:44;"You're like a New Yorker."""
45:44;45:46;"He's like, ""Well, you know, originally I'm from Europe."""
45:46;45:48;"And then I'm kind of like taking chief's lead."
45:48;45:50;"And I'm kind of like, ""Oh, well, what brings you to this event?"""
45:50;45:52;"And he's like, ""Well, we're here with my daughter."""
45:52;45:55;"You know, and then he gestures to his daughter who's sitting at the other end of the table."
45:55;45:56;"And I was like, ""Oh, is she a musician?"""
45:56;45:59;"He said, ""Oh yeah, she's a singer named Bebe Rexha."
45:59;46:00;"She's performing with these guys."""
46:00;46:04;"And then I realized that me and my manager are the only people sitting at the meant to"
46:04;46:06;"be table."
46:06;46:07;"It's literally the meant to be table."
46:07;46:10;"And you just got squeezed in there."
46:10;46:12;"I mean, I couldn't believe my luck."
46:12;46:15;"I mean, if Seinfeld was here, he'd be losing his mind."
46:15;46:17;"The two people I met at the table were both very nice."
46:17;46:22;"Shout out to chief from the FGL crew and shout out to Bebe Rexha's dad."
46:22;46:23;"He was a really sweet guy."
46:23;46:24;"What's his name?"
46:24;46:25;"Like John Rexha?"
46:25;46:28;"I got to be honest, I didn't catch his name, but he was one over from me."
46:28;46:29;"Was Bebe at the table?"
46:29;46:30;"Yeah, no, she was-"
46:30;46:31;"You didn't recognize her?"
46:31;46:32;"No, I-"
46:32;46:33;"I just found out she was from New York."
46:33;46:34;"I didn't know that."
46:34;46:35;"I wouldn't recognize her."
46:35;46:37;"Seinfeld would have."
46:37;46:39;"I didn't quite know what any of these people looked like."
46:39;46:40;"I know what she looks like."
46:40;46:41;"She's from New York."
46:41;46:46;"Dude, how sick would it be if the party planner was actually a TC head?"
46:46;46:48;"Oh yeah."
46:48;46:50;"And deliberately placed you there."
46:50;46:51;"That'd be amazing."
46:51;46:52;"You never know where-"
46:52;46:53;"I could see it."
46:53;46:55;"TC heads are like a secret society."
46:55;46:56;"Like then the waiter brought-"
46:56;46:57;"Skull and bones, dude."
46:57;47:02;"Then at the end, the waiter brought me a second dessert and was like, ""On the house."""
47:02;47:04;"And it was that pancake from-"
47:04;47:07;"It was the pancake from the Harmony Hall video."
47:07;47:08;"So anyway, yeah."
47:08;47:09;"It's just popcorn and raisins."
47:09;47:13;"He brought us a tray of popcorn and raisins and then silently nodded."
47:13;47:15;"The waiter came back and it was Seinfeld."
47:15;47:19;"And he just like went like, ""Shh."""
47:19;47:21;"So anyway, I'm sitting there and I'm like-"
47:21;47:22;"Jesus."
47:22;47:26;"At an event like that, I'm always ready to just kind of like check out."
47:26;47:27;"And then I'm like, ""Whoa, now I'm back."
47:27;47:28;"This is exciting."""
47:28;47:30;"But then here's the downside."
47:30;47:34;"I got to meet Chief and I got to meet Bebe's dad and they're both super nice."
47:34;47:36;"But you know, I'm an artist and I love to have artist to artist conversations."
47:36;47:38;"Oh, they wouldn't let you in."
47:38;47:40;"And I said, ""Chief, can you introduce me?"""
47:40;47:41;"He said, ""Absolutely not."""
47:41;47:42;"""No."""
47:42;47:43;"So we're just sitting there."
47:43;47:44;"But then here's the thing."
47:44;47:49;"Then the performances start and they perform ""Meant to Be"" at the Clive Davis function."
47:49;47:54;"So next thing you know, literally the entire table vanishes to go backstage to get ready."
47:54;47:55;"And actually they were so polite."
47:55;47:57;"Like the Florida Georgia Line crew was like, ""Oh, don't worry."
47:57;47:59;"We won't leave you guys alone too long."""
47:59;48:01;"But then, you know, they had to go do their thing."
48:01;48:06;"And normally I wouldn't bring it up just to say like, you know, I'm a humble person."
48:06;48:10;"I try not to show off too much about like, say meeting an FGL."
48:10;48:12;"But the fact that I was, it wasn't just FGL."
48:12;48:13;"I was at the ""Meant to Be"" table."
48:13;48:14;"Oh yeah, no, I mean."
48:14;48:15;"I mean, talk about ""Meant to Be."""
48:15;48:16;"That's TC Cannon."
48:16;48:18;"That's TC Cannon."
48:18;48:20;"And then, you know, we watched them perform and uh..."
48:20;48:21;"How was the performance?"
48:21;48:22;"Honestly, they nailed it."
48:22;48:27;"And actually made me want to go deeper on FGL because I realized on that song, one of"
48:27;48:29;"the guys sings lead and one guy sings harmony."
48:29;48:31;"I thought they both sang lead on that song."
48:31;48:32;"Oh, like traded?"
48:32;48:35;"No, but yeah, only one guy sings lead on it."
48:35;48:37;"Honestly, all their vocals sounded great."
48:37;48:40;"I don't know if they ended up winning any Grammys, but it's a shame if they didn't because"
48:40;48:42;"that's obviously one of the songs of the year."
48:42;48:45;"You know, there's very few people that I would go out of my way to jawbone with."
48:45;48:50;"FGL and Bebe Rexha perhaps, just for the TC-ness of it, I might have to."
48:50;48:52;"But then, it wasn't ""Meant to Be."""
48:52;48:55;"I think this is more the appropriate TC story."
48:55;48:58;"Yeah, that's what was meant to be."
48:58;48:59;"This is what was meant to be."
48:59;49:02;"A solid 15 minute segment on TC."
49:02;49:03;"Yeah, I almost forgot about that."
49:03;49:07;"So, thank you Patrick World for reminding me."
49:07;49:10;"Baby, lay on back and relax."
49:10;49:13;"Kick your pretty feet up on my dash."
49:13;49:16;"No need to go nowhere fast."
49:16;49:20;"Let's enjoy right here where we at."
49:20;49:23;"Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?"
49:23;49:26;"We got nothing but time."
49:26;49:32;"As long as you're right here next to me, everything's gonna be alright."
49:32;49:36;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
49:36;49:38;"Baby, just let it be."
49:38;49:42;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
49:42;49:44;"Baby, just let it be."
49:44;49:48;"So, won't you ride with me, ride with me."
49:48;49:51;"See where this thing goes."
49:51;49:54;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
49:54;49:57;"Baby, if it's meant to be."
49:57;50:00;"I don't mean to be so uptight."
50:00;50:04;"But my heart's been hurt a couple times by a couple guys."
50:04;50:06;"I didn't treat me right."
50:06;50:09;"I ain't gonna lie, ain't gonna lie."
50:09;50:12;"'Cause I'm tired of the fake love."
50:12;50:13;"Show me what you're made of."
50:13;50:16;"Boy, make me believe."
50:16;50:18;"Oh, hold up girl."
50:18;50:20;"Don't you know you're beautiful?"
50:20;50:22;"And it's easy to see."
50:22;50:26;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
50:26;50:28;"Baby, just let it be."
50:28;50:32;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
50:32;50:34;"Baby, just let it be."
50:34;50:38;"So, won't you ride with me, ride with me."
50:38;50:40;"See where this thing goes."
50:40;50:44;"If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be."
50:44;50:47;"Baby, if it's meant to be."
50:47;50:53;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
50:53;50:54;"I was just gonna wrap it up and say,"
50:54;50:58;"Patrick World continues to just drop top level material."
50:58;50:59;"Okay, and we got one more."
50:59;51:00;"So, we got one more?"
51:00;51:01;"We got one more."
51:01;51:03;"We got a real backlog of Patrick World."
51:03;51:05;"He's very prolific."
51:05;51:09;"Last time we were talking about Ariana Grande's tattoo."
51:09;51:10;"Despot, you hear about this?"
51:10;51:12;"Yeah, small charcoal grill, yeah."
51:12;51:14;"So, what was this supposed to be though?"
51:14;51:15;"I forgot. Oh, seven ring."
51:15;51:16;"It was supposed to be seven rings."
51:16;51:18;"It actually said small charcoal grill."
51:18;51:19;"I'm sure we weren't the only people who said this,"
51:19;51:22;"but we were saying that knowing that Ariana Grande"
51:22;51:25;"is a very kind of savvy pop star,"
51:25;51:27;"she knows how to kind of surf popular culture."
51:27;51:29;"She knows how to weave her own personal life"
51:29;51:32;"into her songs and kind of use social media."
51:32;51:35;"Remember when we went to an Ariana Grande show at Barclays?"
51:35;51:36;"Oh, that's true."
51:36;51:38;"That was before she was like super cool."
51:38;51:39;"She had Barclays though?"
51:39;51:40;"Yeah."
51:40;51:41;"No, that was at the Garden actually."
51:41;51:42;"Was it?"
51:42;51:43;"I think it was at the Garden."
51:43;51:46;"I think it was Barclays, but she had that glove,"
51:46;51:48;"remember, that modulated her voice"
51:48;51:50;"and it was like some Imogen Heap."
51:50;51:51;"Yeah."
51:51;51:53;"That was sick, but she didn't keep doing that, did she?"
51:53;51:55;"I don't know, maybe she does."
51:55;51:57;"Maybe it's like just part of her live camp."
51:57;51:58;"You know, it's how like Fish will every once in a while"
51:58;52:00;"jump on trampolines."
52:00;52:00;"Right."
52:00;52:01;"Ariana Grande every once in a while be like,"
52:01;52:04;"""Now, you know, I haven't busted out the glove"
52:04;52:07;"""in about three and a half years."
52:07;52:08;"""Should I do it?"""
52:08;52:10;"That was also interesting 'cause it was like,"
52:10;52:12;"she hadn't quite got the props she's getting now"
52:12;52:14;"as being like the super interesting one"
52:14;52:15;"or one of the super interesting ones."
52:15;52:18;"And she showed like a documentary of her"
52:18;52:20;"and Imogen Heap like developing these gloves."
52:20;52:21;"Yeah."
52:21;52:23;"Like they were actually working on them together."
52:23;52:24;"It was great."
52:24;52:26;"I remember, yeah, I remember walking away being like--"
52:26;52:27;"Like Frampton, dude."
52:27;52:28;"She's got a great voice."
52:28;52:30;"Well, everybody already knew she had a great voice"
52:30;52:31;"and you know, some big songs,"
52:31;52:32;"but it was kind of like,"
52:32;52:34;"""Okay, she's a little experimental too."""
52:34;52:35;"Yeah."
52:35;52:37;"Now, flash forward to 2019,"
52:37;52:39;"she gets her seven rings tattooed,"
52:39;52:41;"turns out it's a small charcoal grill."
52:41;52:43;"There's a certain type of person"
52:43;52:44;"who couldn't come back from that."
52:44;52:46;"There's a type of weak singer"
52:46;52:48;"who would probably get roasted for that"
52:48;52:49;"and they'd be so embarrassed."
52:49;52:50;"Just folds."
52:50;52:51;"Who would that be?"
52:51;52:52;"I'm not gonna say."
52:52;52:53;"(laughing)"
52:53;52:54;"I know."
52:54;52:56;"Maybe the guy who made the Animal Crossing,"
52:56;52:57;"sicko mode."
52:57;52:58;"That's (beep) up."
52:58;53:00;"You know that that's who you're targeting,"
53:00;53:02;"of all people."
53:02;53:04;"I just got a problem with that."
53:04;53:05;"Oh wait, no, I forgot."
53:05;53:06;"You convinced me that it's good."
53:06;53:07;"I actually like it."
53:07;53:07;"It's not baby music."
53:07;53:08;"Yeah."
53:08;53:10;"So anyway, we were saying that Ariana Grande,"
53:10;53:11;"if anybody would know what to do"
53:11;53:15;"with a pretty embarrassing tattoo snafu,"
53:15;53:16;"it would be Ariana Grande."
53:16;53:18;"And we started saying that she would probably"
53:18;53:19;"write a song on her next album called--"
53:19;53:21;"I feel like you wrote the song."
53:21;53:21;"We basically wrote the song"
53:21;53:24;"and it was like a trap song that just went,"
53:24;53:27;"""Small charcoal grill, small charcoal grill."""
53:27;53:29;"And then she would sing some R&B stuff"
53:29;53:33;"and talk about her hair."
53:33;53:34;"Just a very literal song."
53:34;53:37;"Slap on my knob pattern there."
53:37;53:39;"Yeah, but she came back into fashion"
53:39;53:40;"the past couple years."
53:40;53:42;"Small charcoal grill."
53:42;53:44;"(hums)"
53:44;53:46;"Yeah, something about she'll kill you"
53:46;53:49;"if you talk (beep) about her tattoo."
53:49;53:50;"Of course."
53:50;53:52;"And she'll probably, I think lately in her music,"
53:52;53:56;"there's been a real confidence and braggadocio."
53:56;53:58;"So maybe there'd be something about like,"
53:58;54:00;"I don't need to know how to read Japanese."
54:00;54:02;"That's a little--"
54:02;54:04;"Yeah, that probably wouldn't help her"
54:04;54:06;"given some of her recent stuff."
54:06;54:08;"Okay, you know how to read Japanese."
54:08;54:09;"I just bought--"
54:09;54:10;"Japan."
54:10;54:10;"I just bought Japan."
54:10;54:12;"(laughs)"
54:12;54:14;"Yes, I don't know."
54:14;54:15;"I'm not trying to write the song."
54:15;54:18;"I'm just saying that if anybody would take something"
54:18;54:20;"a little embarrassing or awkward"
54:20;54:23;"and turn it into gold, I could picture that."
54:23;54:24;"She did that with ""Thank U, Next."""
54:24;54:25;"Yeah, true."
54:25;54:27;"Don't be surprised if this summer,"
54:27;54:30;"there's a number one hit song, Ariana Grande,"
54:30;54:33;"featuring Lil Durk, ""Small Charcoal Grill."""
54:33;54:34;"Featuring Patrick World."
54:34;54:37;"Okay, so anyway, I guess Patrick World actually cooked up."
54:37;54:39;"Ariana and Durk would be good."
54:39;54:40;"It makes sense."
54:40;54:40;"Yeah."
54:40;54:41;"He sings."
54:41;54:42;"Or maybe she would, yeah."
54:42;54:43;"All right, let's check it out."
54:43;54:44;"So this is Patrick World,"

55:35;55:36;"Okay."
55:36;55:38;"What is it, like eight or nine songs from Patrick?"
55:38;55:39;"It's quite a few."
55:39;55:41;"Psyched for the TC vinyl."
55:41;55:44;"But that you can't just keep running with that flow"
55:44;55:46;"'cause that's Soulja Boy."
55:46;55:48;"And that's 2 Chainz, really."
55:48;55:50;"Oh, well, I guess you got called out for this song."
55:50;55:51;"Yeah, people were mad."
55:51;55:52;"But they were mad."
55:52;55:52;"Soulja Boy is really mad."
55:52;55:54;"They're mad, but it still hasn't stopped the song."
55:54;55:55;"It's number one."
55:55;55:56;"Is it?"
55:56;55:57;"I don't know. In many countries."
55:57;55:58;"I believe that."
55:58;55:59;"That's cool."
55:59;56:00;"Good for her, I like her."
56:00;56:03;"Aren't you allowed to steal flows in hip hop?"
56:03;56:04;"Not really."
56:04;56:05;"Really?"
56:05;56:06;"I mean, a lot of people do it,"
56:06;56:08;"but I think it's frowned upon."
56:08;56:11;"You gotta write new lyrics and they make a new beat"
56:11;56:12;"and come up with a new flow?"
56:12;56:14;"Yeah, man."
56:14;56:15;"That's a lot. That's a lot."
56:15;56:16;"I know."
56:16;56:19;"That's a lot."
56:19;56:19;"Yeah."
56:19;56:21;"That's a lot you gotta come up with."
56:21;56:22;"Yeah, three things."
56:22;56:27;"I got seven rings, but I don't have three things."
56:27;56:29;"Yeah, exactly."
56:29;56:30;"All right."
56:30;56:32;"What was ""Seven Rings"" about, anyway?"
56:32;56:35;"That was a very confusing kind of black hole for TC."
56:35;56:37;"It's not one of our proudest moments."
56:37;56:38;"All right, figure it out."
56:38;56:39;"We were trying to figure out what the song was about"
56:39;56:44;"and also unpack the controversy about the song"
56:44;56:47;"and she got into it with the Princess Nokia."
56:47;56:49;"But did she get into it with her?"
56:49;56:50;"Yes."
56:50;56:51;"Oh, I didn't know that."
56:51;56:52;"We at least know that much."
56:52;56:53;"I thought Princess Nokia was--"
56:53;56:56;"Arielle was doing some serious reporting."
56:56;56:57;"Yeah."
56:57;57:00;"I thought Princess Nokia was yelling into a vacuum."
57:00;57:03;"No, apparently Ariana did respond,"
57:03;57:04;"but then she deleted it and--"
57:04;57:05;"Oh, I didn't know that."
57:05;57:07;"Well, good for both of them."
57:07;57:09;"Basically, we were reading one of those crazy articles"
57:09;57:13;"that's kind of like gossipcop69xo.com"
57:13;57:16;"that just kind of like says like,"
57:16;57:18;"""Ariana Grande clapped back, but then deleted."""
57:18;57:21;"And it's just like, you just cannot follow the story."
57:21;57:22;"What was the clapback?"
57:22;57:24;"Do you remember?"
57:24;57:26;"Something about how she's not racist,"
57:26;57:28;"she's solving racism."
57:28;57:29;"Is that correct?"
57:29;57:30;"That's a bad clapback."
57:30;57:34;"That is the take backable clapback."
57:34;57:36;"I don't even want to try to get into that again."
57:36;57:38;"Well, I mean, good for her."
57:38;57:39;"Solve racism."
57:39;57:40;"So that's over?"
57:40;57:45;"Again, we're gonna have to crack open the books."

01:00:18;01:00:20;"who was not born in 1946."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"He was born in 1961."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"- Still a boomer."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"I'm psyched for a Gen X president."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"- Oh man."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Just a real ironic president."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"- I mean, do we even wanna start talking about the primaries?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"- I think I should run for president"
01:00:31;01:00:34;"or like at least mayor of New York or something."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- I'd vote for you."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- I think I'd win."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- Why not? - I don't wanna do it."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"- Give it a shot, man."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"- I think it's a bit of a thankless task."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"- Yeah, I don't wanna do it, but I wanna win."
01:00:43;01:00:47;"- You know, people are already starting to talk about,"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"you know, Bernie."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"- He's back."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"- Bernie's back."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"- Where are you at with Bernie 2019/20?"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"- I mean, he's running and you know."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- He's part of the TC story."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- He's part of the TC story."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I really gotta crack open the books and see."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"- You seem ambivalent."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"- You know, I got scars from all the,"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"from the culture wars, man."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"- So you worried about it opening up"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"a divisive fight within."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"- Well, look, it's already divisive, so who knows?"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"But I guess, you know, we'll see who's left."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"We'll see how people do, but."
01:01:16;01:01:19;"- It's too early to get too far down about it."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- Is that like coded language right there?"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"We'll see who's left."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- Yeah, we'll see who's really left."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"Who's ready to lead the revolution."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"- Interesting."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"- Obviously, we gotta support whoever would win,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"but some people have said this."
01:01:31;01:01:34;"It's kind of a bad sign if somebody wants to be president,"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"but somebody needs to be president."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"You know what I mean?"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"- Mm-hmm."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"- It's like weird to want to be president."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"- Yeah, it's pretty weird."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"I want to be president."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"- You do want to be president?"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- Yeah."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"- I mean, I guess the argument you would make"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"for Sanders is that he has a distinct worldview."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"- He's consistent."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"I mean, it would be great to just get some."
01:01:52;01:01:52;"- I like that guy."
01:01:52;01:01:56;"He's like a professor from a Disney movie or some (beep)."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"Like he's all clumsy and like (beep) falling apart"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"and blowing up."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"- He's invented flubber."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- He says like, ""Gee willikers"" or something."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"Yeah."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- Of course, of course I love Bernie."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"I need to see what's going on though."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- It's too early to get,"
01:02:09;01:02:12;"the primaries are a goddamn year away."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- Yeah."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"Don't forget to register though."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- All right, that was."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Don't forget to register."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- Our political coverage for the entire year."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"- We'll have plenty more to talk about."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"But I mean, don't you think this is weird"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"that these guys were all born in 1946?"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"- You think they all came from like the same."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- Within two months?"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"- Giant egg."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- Kind of."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"- There's just some big egg."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"- Oh, yeah, there's something shady about it."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"- And they popped out of it and then they were incubated."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"- What are you talking?"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"I mean, just the baby boom."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"- They're all from like some weird fertility experiment."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"- Do you follow the Instagram account, Illuminati Killers?"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"- Wow."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- I do follow a few conspiracy theory ones."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"What do they have to say?"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- I don't know."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Crazy stuff."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- You don't wanna share?"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"- Not really."
01:02:51;01:02:55;"- Theoretically, you would think that maybe every president"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"would get like a little bit younger."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Or you would say like, you know,"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"if people like Bill Clinton, you might say,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"all right, people like a president who's around that age."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"- How old was he, like 50?"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"- I think he was in his 40s."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"- He started in his 40s."
01:03:09;01:03:09;"But then it's weird."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"- So did Obama."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- It's just weird that,"
01:03:11;01:03:12;"'cause sometimes people talk about the power"
01:03:12;01:03:16;"of the baby boomers, almost in like conspiracy theory terms."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"You know, you sometimes see this framework"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"where it's like the boomers versus millennials."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"And it's like the boomers hold power."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"They don't respect millennials and the struggle."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"And they took all the good jobs"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"and they don't know how good they have it."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"And they, whatever, they make fun of millennials"
01:03:30;01:03:32;"who clearly have less opportunity."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"And you're kind of like, all right,"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"well, obviously we're talking about"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"hundreds of millions of people."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"It's more complicated than that."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"And then you're like, but three presidents,"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"20 years of presidency so far."
01:03:43;01:03:46;"We're all born in within two months in 1946."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"I'm not trying to go to Alex Jones, but come on."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"That's clearly some kind of weird phrase."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"- I've seen the documents."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"- Yeah, it's weird."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"- It wasn't an egg, it was probably an egg, a big egg."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"- I think it was a big egg."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"- They all came out of the same big egg."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"- They came out of the same big egg."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"And we don't know exactly how these big eggs function."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- It's a big egg theory."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- It is definitely a big egg."
01:04:04;01:04:08;"And for all we know, the spawn come out of the big egg"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"over two months."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"That might seem kind of weird in terms of what we know"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"about human childbirth, but in the big egg, it's different."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- Yeah, they incubate in the egg."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"They hatch at different rates,"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"depending on a bunch of things."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- Exactly."

01:05:13;01:05:15;"- Wait, hold on, what does this say?"
01:05:15;01:05:19;"This says that 1946 was the year of the fire dog?"
01:05:19;01:05:19;"- What's that?"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"- In the Chinese year designations."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"- Oh, you can't--"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"- You get an animal and you also get like an element."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"Like, wasn't it the year of the fire monkey recently?"
01:05:27;01:05:30;"- Oh, I didn't know that, I just knew it was the animal."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"I think I'm a dog."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"- A fire dog?"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"- I know it's a pig right now, but what?"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"Is it a ice pig or something?"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I thought it was just a pig."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"- It would be crazy though,"
01:05:38;01:05:41;"if the Democratic nominee was another baby boomer."
01:05:41;01:05:45;"If it was like Sanders or, is Elizabeth Warren,"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"like she's like 70, right?"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"- Younger than Bernie for sure."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"1946 was the year of the fire dog"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"and then 2006 was the next year of the fire dog."
01:05:53;01:05:57;"So we probably got some 13 year olds right now"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"who hatched out of the same egg pod."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"They got something going on."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"The fire dog has an extremely active"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"and outgoing personality."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"- Wait, what if I'm a fire dog?"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- No, but you're not, 'cause you're just a dog."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"- What?"
01:06:09;01:06:12;"- Because the only fire dog years were 1946 and 2006."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- But I gotta be a something dog, right?"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"- You're some kind of dog."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"- Where do you find out your element?"
01:06:18;01:06:19;"What is this?"
01:06:19;01:06:20;"- I don't know, but I'm just on some--"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Oh, I'm a water dog."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"- You're a water dog?"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"You're the opposite of these dogs."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"You wanna hear some other famous dogs?"
01:06:27;01:06:30;"According to fengshuiweb.co.uk."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"- Yeah."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"- Sylvester Stallone."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"- Sick."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"- Donald Trump, we already knew that."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"- Yeah."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"- Freddie Mercury."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"Elvis Presley."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"- Not so good."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"- I mean, but these are major dudes."
01:06:41;01:06:41;"- True."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Uma Thurman."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"Naomi Campbell. - I like her."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"- Kate Bush. - I like her."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"- Madonna."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"- She's cool. - David Bowie."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Whoa, that's a lot of major stars."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley,"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"Madonna, Judy Garland, David Bowie."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- These are all fire dogs."
01:06:55;01:06:56;"- No, these are just dogs."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"- Oh, okay, good."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- These are all just dogs."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- Well, I'm a dog."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"- Wow, fire dogs taking over."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"- What are you?"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"- It's a little embarrassing."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"- You're a rat."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Yeah."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"- Knew it."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- But hold on, let's see what kind of rat,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"can you look up April 1984?"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"Can I get a number crunch on--"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"- So every month has an animal?"
01:07:17;01:07:17;"- It's every year."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"- Oh, every year."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"- Well, but I thought that the,"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"I guess, does it just straight up correspond"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"to the Gregorian calendar?"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"- Well, it's a little bit,"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"'cause the Chinese New Year is what?"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"The Lunar New Year is like January."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- Yes, I thought maybe it's a little different."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"- Slightly."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- Oh, I'm a water rat."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"- I'm a water dog."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"- I guess we're two water dudes."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"Okay, what about Jake?"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"You were born in '77?"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"- Yeah, February of '77."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Fire."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"- Fire snake."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- That's pretty dope."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"- Whoa, what?"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"- Wow."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- That's way better."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- I don't know what any of this means, but--"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"- I would've thought you'd be something chill,"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"like a earth--"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- Dog."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- Earth dog."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- No, wait, no, I'm not in that year."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"It's February 18th, '77 to February 6th, '78."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"- When, what's your birthday?"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"- February 3rd."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"- Oh, so you were--"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"- Whoa, okay."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"- I'm 1976 then, but that."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- We gotta get somebody on the show"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"to actually explain this stuff to us."

01:08:20;01:08:23;"- I mean, when I heard the concept,"
01:08:23;01:08:23;"- I didn't even know about it."
01:08:23;01:08:25;"- It made no sense, but the trailer,"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"honestly, kind of winning."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"- It's kind of a feel good trailer."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"- Fire dragon."
01:08:31;01:08:33;"- Fire dragon?"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"- It's even more badass."

01:14:42;01:14:44;"We take so long on the music."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"And there's a part of me that I always focus on the negative"

01:15:36;01:15:38;"- Damn, I played the Wii saxophone."
01:15:38;01:15:41;"- That's right, that was a classic part of that video."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"I just felt, you know, it's like making a video too,"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"it's like too many years go by"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"and it's like time to make a video"

01:15:47;01:15:48;"You know what I mean?"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"I spent a lot of time over the past five years"
01:15:50;01:15:54;"like thinking about music, writing songs, whatever."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"That's part of the repertoire."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"But then it's like, yeah, now it's time to make a video."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"It's like, ugh."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"- Really?"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"- There's something nice about being forced to do something"
01:16:03;01:16:04;"or not forced, nobody forced us,"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"but just being encouraged and then you're like,"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"all right, how do we make this fun?"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"No, if I put my foot down, nobody would have forced us."
01:16:10;01:16:14;"These days in music, label people are very chill."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"I just think it's too much of a cliche"

01:16:21;01:16:22;"- Oh my God."

01:16:54;01:16:58;"in a bit of like a late '70s, early '80s rut for a while."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"- That's just your opinion."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"I don't think you're getting stuck in that."

01:17:03;01:17:04;"- I think that's a rich vein."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"- Well, we're just switching it up."
01:17:05;01:17:06;"- It's your show, man."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"(laughing)"
01:17:08;01:17:09;"- I think we did one recently"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"that was in like the 2000s or something or the '90s."
01:17:12;01:17:15;"- I think we did one from like 2013."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"- Oh yeah, that was cool."
01:17:16;01:17:17;"- Maybe two episodes ago."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"'Cause that was the last time you put out a record."
01:17:19;01:17:23;"And then last episode we did 1959."
01:17:23;01:17:23;"- Yeah, so I like it."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"We're switching it up."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Now we're going even further into the past."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- What are we doing?"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"- 1946 versus 2019."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"Why 1946, Despot?"
01:17:32;01:17:35;"- Oh, 'cause all the presidents"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"were hatched from a giant egg that year."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"- That's right."
01:17:38;01:17:42;"So 1946, Billboard had a chart."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"It had a slightly different name, but who cares, whatever."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"This is the Billboard 1946 top hits."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"So we're gonna be comparing them"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"to the top five songs on iTunes right now."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"So the number five song in 1946, we're taking it way back,"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Bing Crosby, well, he's famous."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"- Yeah, heard of him."
01:18:00;01:18:00;"- Heard of him."
01:18:00;01:18:03;"The song though, ""I Can't Begin to Tell You."""

01:18:07;01:18:09;"Sounds about right."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"- So these were based on record sales?"

01:25:52;01:25:54;"since 1964, the Beatles?"
01:25:54;01:25:55;"- Okay."
01:25:55;01:25:57;"- So she's got seven rings."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"- And three. - Thank you, next."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"- What's the other one?"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- Break up with your girlfriend on board."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- Top three?"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"- Now keep in mind, that's Billboard."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"We do iTunes."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"- Oh, I know."
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Still, that's crazy."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"- Is that gonna be a headline?"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Seven rings, three Billboard spots?"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"- That'd be a good one."
01:26:13;01:26:14;"- Yeah, take note."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"- What if you just tweeted that?"
01:26:16;01:26:19;"Seven rings and three Billboard spots."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"Congratulations are in order to Ms. Ariana Grande."
01:26:22;01:26:25;"- All right, I'll tweet that."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- Sign it, @desphone."
01:26:28;01:26:29;"- Should I tweet that right now?"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"- Please do."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"- All right."
01:26:31;01:26:36;"- I like this other thing on this sheet they gave us."
01:26:36;01:26:39;"Recently squashed a beef with Piers Morgan."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"- Oh God."
01:26:40;01:26:43;"- There was some dumb beef they had on Twitter or something."
01:26:43;01:26:46;"- I'm sure it was mostly him."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- They bumped into each other at a restaurant"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"and cleared the air."
01:26:49;01:26:49;"- Wonder what restaurant."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"- That's the part I like."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"- All right, I did it."
01:26:52;01:26:54;"I'll let you guys know what the responses are like."

01:27:11;01:27:12;"- Oh, that's cool."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Is he still on CNN?"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"- I don't know."
01:27:15;01:27:18;"I thought he was like a total joke, but he's on something."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"He still has some kind of platform."
01:27:20;01:27:20;"- All right."

01:31:27;01:31:28;"(laughing)"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"- I think people were very moved in the film"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"because there's so much talk about riding Peter Parker."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"Oh no, it's not Peter Parker."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"It's Miles Morales."

01:31:45;01:31:46;"- Yeah, that might be the one"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"that she wants to ride like a cruise."
01:31:48;01:31:48;"- The pig."
01:31:48;01:31:49;"- Yeah."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"(laughing)"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"Oh wait, maybe she just meant she wanted to like,"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"take a piggy ride, ride on his back."
01:31:55;01:31:56;"- A piggyback."
01:31:56;01:31:56;"- A piggyback ride."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Okay, it's PG after all."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"- Well, that's what I was saying, yeah."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"- Anyway, I kind of alluded to before,"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"all the TC heads, or at least the VW heads,"
01:32:04;01:32:07;"already know that one of our next songs is called ""Sunflower."""

01:32:11;01:32:12;"- No, you shouldn't care."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"- And I love Posty and Sway Lee."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Despot's the first person who told me about Post Malone."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"- Well, I'm sorry."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"- Shout out to Despot."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"- You were one of the first people"
01:32:20;01:32:23;"who said Post Malone is good, about a million years ago."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"You heard White Iverson on SoundCloud."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"- He played a show at Santos Party House"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"where Lil Uzi opened for him."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"- Didn't you like bring him to Coachella to do,"
01:32:32;01:32:32;"but it wasn't--"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"- In Interview Magazine Party."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"He didn't exist yet."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Then he started existing after that."
01:32:38;01:32:42;"I paid Post Malone $500 to perform at that show,"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"and Uzi $200."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"- That's crazy."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"(laughing)"
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Man."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"- It didn't sell out."
01:32:47;01:32:50;"- For $700, you too could have a Post Malone,"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Lil Uzi Vert show."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"- If you find the new ones."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"- If you find a time machine."
01:32:55;01:32:55;"- Yeah, that too."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"- Anyway, even though I think there's some mutual respect,"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"doesn't matter that we have a song called ""Sunflower."""
01:33:01;01:33:02;"It's a very different song."
01:33:02;01:33:03;"- I think it matters, yeah."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"- Different market."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"(laughing)"
01:33:06;01:33:09;"- Well, you gotta understand that we had a song"
01:33:09;01:33:12;"called ""Flower Moon,"" and then I wanted a sister song"
01:33:12;01:33:13;"for ""Flower Moon."""
01:33:13;01:33:16;"And the opposite of ""Flower Moon"" is ""Sunflower."""
01:33:16;01:33:18;"- Okay, copy that."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"- It's a good song too."
01:33:19;01:33:19;"Well, whatever."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"- It's also a pretty common--"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"- Flower."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"- Yeah, there's probably a lot of songs called ""Sunflower."""
01:33:24;01:33:25;"- I'm sure there are."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"- There are."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"There's, what was there?"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"There's a Wu-Tang song called ""Sunflower."""
01:33:30;01:33:31;"I'm pretty sure."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- If there was a post song that came out"

01:33:35;01:33:36;"- Yeah."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"Is there?"
01:33:37;01:33:38;"- Yeah, I think so."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"- You haven't heard it?"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"- Oh no."
01:33:40;01:33:40;"- Yeah."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"- Let's play that (beep)"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"- All right, I think there's room for two."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"Also, like I said, I gotta follow my own advice."
01:33:47;01:33:48;"I gave Greta Van Fleet."
01:33:48;01:33:50;"- Well, that was ""Sunshower."""
01:33:50;01:33:51;"- Rocks played out, dog."
01:33:51;01:33:51;"- Wu-Tang one."
01:33:51;01:33:54;"- Is ""Sunflower"" gonna be a single?"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Or is it just an album cut?"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"- It depends how you look at it."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"It's gonna get its own little moment."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"- The B side?"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"Is it like the 2021 of the next--"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"- No, I would say it's the A side of the next batch,"
01:34:04;01:34:06;"but this is like the funky batch."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"- Okay."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"- In a way."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"I think it's a special song."
01:34:09;01:34:12;"We're gonna have a lot of fun with it."
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Anyway, oh, this is an interesting one."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"I'll admit that when I was double checking"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"that they had ""Billboard 1946,"" I came across this."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"- Okay."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"- The number two song in 1946."

01:49:49;01:49:51;"- I believe it's Calvin Brodus."

01:49:54;01:49:56;"Snoop Dogg and Calvin Brodus."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"- Yep."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"- To some extent, Snoop Dogg is a character,"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"but you know, there's also a huge intersection"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"in the same way that Bradley put his heart and soul"
01:50:03;01:50:05;"into that character, and the character Jackson Maine"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"only exists because of Bradley Cooper."
01:50:07;01:50:10;"- Yeah, but Calvin Brodus isn't like when I'm rapping"

01:50:18;01:50:18;"- Like--"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"- No, Calvin Brodus says--"
01:50:20;01:50:24;"- I'm saying Jackson Maine is, what else is his name?"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"- I'm just saying, if Calvin Brodus--"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"- If you take a regular-ass first and last name,"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"it's different than being like, my name is Alec Rhinestone,"
01:50:32;01:50:35;"but when I rap, I'm Snoop Dogg."

01:50:50;01:50:55;"I'm saying, these guys have alter ego names."

01:51:02;01:51:05;"are we gonna pretend that Snoop Lion never existed"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"and this is Snoop Dogg performing a Snoop Lion song?"
01:51:07;01:51:11;"- Wait a second, also, Cooper did not issue a press release."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"This was just--"
01:51:12;01:51:12;"- No, he was just doing an interview."
01:51:12;01:51:14;"- Okay, so that's way different."
01:51:14;01:51:15;"It just kinda came out--"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- I just think it's different,"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"'cause you're talking about different types of pseudonyms."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"Like, if my name is Alec Rhinestone"
01:51:22;01:51:26;"and my pseudonym when I'm performing is like, Ass Man,"

01:54:29;01:54:30;"(laughing)"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"Anyway, maybe the moral of the story"
01:54:32;01:54:34;"is everybody's right here."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"If Bradley takes the stage and he sings a song"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"and says, ""I'm singing this as Bradley,"""
01:54:38;01:54:39;"and everybody else is watching and saying,"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"""Well, I'm singing Jackson Maine,"""
01:54:41;01:54:44;"well, that's the magic of a Hollyweird."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"And also, shouldn't this be a decision"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"that he makes with his duet partner,"
01:54:48;01:54:51;"Lady Gaga, AKA Ally?"
01:54:51;01:54:51;"Imagine this."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"This is a huge role for her."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"She probably really embodied the character of Ally."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- What's Lady Gaga's real name?"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"- Stephanie Germanotta."
01:54:58;01:55:01;"- What if she wanted to be Stephanie Germanotta"
01:55:01;01:55:02;"for this performance?"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- I could actually picture that."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"That could be a cool sequel to ""A Star is Born"""
01:55:05;01:55:07;"that's about a film."
01:55:07;01:55:11;"It's got the tone of ""The Trip,"" ""The Trip to Italy."""
01:55:11;01:55:14;"And it's Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"get offered some tremendous amount of money"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"to take ""A Star is Born"" on the road."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"- We're all thinking like a weird corporate private gig."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- Or maybe it's a corporate private gig,"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"but some of the tension in the film"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"is that Lady Gaga always wants to identify as Ally"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"'cause she's like, ""I can't sing these songs"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"""as Lady Gaga nor Stephanie Germanotta."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"""When I sing these songs, I'm Ally."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"""I gave a whole bunch of my life,"
01:55:35;01:55:38;"""and you're the one who inspired me to become Ally."""
01:55:38;01:55:39;"So when I sing, I'm Ally."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"And she's always like, ""Well, hello there."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"""Wow, I can't believe it."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"""I'm still on my first album,"
01:55:45;01:55:49;"""and you guys already are showing so much respect for me."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"""My name is Ally."""
01:55:50;01:55:51;"And then he comes out and says,"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"""And my name is Bradley Cooper."""
01:55:53;01:55:54;"- But then what happens?"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"They just play the song."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"- It's like a screwball comedy."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"""I'm Ally, and I'm Bradley Cooper."""
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Something like that."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"- Then they do like tomato, tomato."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"- Exactly."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"- And a lot of them just in the car"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"and in restaurants arguing about it."
01:56:08;01:56:11;"- I would love that, them just driving from gig to gig."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"That'd be tight, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in the car."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"She starts doing Ally, and she's like,"
01:56:15;01:56:16;"""Come on, do Jackson Maine."""
01:56:16;01:56:17;"""Not gonna do it."""
01:56:17;01:56:19;"""I'm not gonna do it."""
01:56:19;01:56:20;"That's Bradley's normal voice."
01:56:20;01:56:21;"""Stephanie, I'm not gonna do it."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"""My name is Ally."""
01:56:23;01:56:25;"""Stephanie, will you just calm down?"""
01:56:25;01:56:26;"""Jackson, you know what, forget you."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"""You called me ugly."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"""How dare you, I hate you."""
01:56:29;01:56:33;"""I didn't call you ugly, Stephanie, relax."""
01:56:33;01:56:34;"""Oh, Jackson."""
01:56:34;01:56:35;"All right, and then he goes,"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"""You know, there could be some fun there."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"""There's fun to be had."""
01:56:39;01:56:40;"- That's a 90-minute comedy."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"- Yeah, definitely."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"- Oh, I was thinking more like four and a half hour art film."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"- I like that too."
01:56:45;01:56:48;"- The real-time drive between Denver and Salt Lake City."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"- Oh yeah, one take."
01:56:49;01:56:52;"- They have two giant corporate gigs,"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"and for some reason, they're like snowed in or something,"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"and they're like, ""If you guys want this check,"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"""you're gonna have to drive."""
01:56:58;01:56:59;"- Yeah."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"- Oh, it's eight hours."
01:57:01;01:57:02;"It's an eight-hour stage play."
01:57:02;01:57:06;"- There's no PJ available, so you're driving,"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"just the two of you."
01:57:07;01:57:09;"- Do you think that there's such big stars"
01:57:09;01:57:13;"that if you did a one-take, six-and-a-half-hour--"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"- Art film."
01:57:14;01:57:19;"- Art film with just Lady Gaga and Cooper in character,"
01:57:19;01:57:23;"just talking on a road trip, that people would go see it?"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"- Yeah."
01:57:24;01:57:26;"- I bet if it was good, if it was as good as The Trip,"
01:57:26;01:57:28;"and I mean, they're both very talented,"
01:57:28;01:57:32;"but Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon,"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"that's really their bread and butter."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"You ever watch those movies, Alec?"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"The Trip movies?"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"- No."
01:57:36;01:57:38;"- It's where the English guys drive around"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"going to restaurants and just talking."
01:57:40;01:57:42;"It's one of those movies--"
01:57:42;01:57:43;"- Doing Michael Caine impressions."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"- Doing Michael Caine impressions."
01:57:45;01:57:48;"It's one of those movies that I think of so fondly,"
01:57:48;01:57:49;"but I could also imagine being like,"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"""Oh, you gotta watch The Trip,"""
01:57:50;01:57:51;"and then somebody watches it just be like,"
01:57:51;01:57:52;"""This sucked."""
01:57:52;01:57:53;"- ""This sucked."""
01:57:53;01:57:54;"I love all The Trip movies."
01:57:54;01:57:55;"- They're great."
01:57:55;01:57:57;"- Ariel's a huge trip head."
01:57:57;01:57:57;"- That's tight."
01:57:57;01:58:01;"- I think that even if things got a little awkward,"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"90 minutes of them just driving"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"would still be kind of fascinating."
01:58:06;01:58:07;"- We're talking six-hour art film, though."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"- Okay, but in the six-hour art film--"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"- You cut it down to the 90."
01:58:10;01:58:13;"- But what's a six-hour drive, SF to LA?"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"- Yeah, they hit the In-N-Out in Kettleman City."
01:58:15;01:58:16;"- That might be more on point."
01:58:16;01:58:19;"It's like, they're in San Francisco for something,"
01:58:19;01:58:20;"and then they have to get to--"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"- Some weird tech conference."
01:58:22;01:58:23;"- And the next night's the Oscars."
01:58:23;01:58:24;"- We're finding it."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"- Long story short, they have to drive."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"We'll get Tony Kushner to figure out that bull (beep)"
01:58:28;01:58:30;"when he sketches it out."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"I think with just the roughest outline"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"of the arc of what happens with them,"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"these two talented performers"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"would just kind of fill it in."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"Okay, what do you think?"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Should we do, let's say, another 45 on Bradley Cooper?"
01:58:42;01:58:45;"(laughing)"
01:58:45;01:58:48;"- Just a real slow wrap up here."
01:58:48;01:58:50;"- No, but he really is cool."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"I do respect--"
01:58:51;01:58:52;"- Have you met him?"
01:58:52;01:58:53;"- Yeah, I've met him here and there."
01:58:53;01:58:55;"I always thought he was super nice."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"- What context did you meet him in?"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"- Just see him around people that I know know him,"
01:59:01;01:59:06;"and I always thought he seemed like a super mellow dude."
01:59:06;01:59:11;"Didn't seem like some weird superstar ego."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"Just seemed like a chill dude."
01:59:13;01:59:14;"And actually, I did feel bad for him"
01:59:14;01:59:16;"that he didn't get nominated for best director."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"That seemed a little unfair, didn't it?"
01:59:18;01:59:19;"- Extremely unfair."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"- Let's get Bradley Cooper's whole filmography up,"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"'cause I wanna do another 45 on him."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Okay, that's enough time crisis."
01:59:25;01:59:26;"(laughing)"
01:59:26;01:59:27;"That's enough time crisis."
01:59:27;01:59:29;"Everybody needs to go, everybody's probably excited"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"to go have their little Oscars party,"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"put out some hummus and goldfish,"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"invite the friends over, have some fun."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"- You said it like goldfish."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- Goldfish."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"Goldfish."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"- Yeah."
01:59:43;01:59:46;"- Why not on Oscar night, they're goldfish."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"- That's fair."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"- Thanks to our East Coast ambassador,"
01:59:49;01:59:52;"president of TC East, Despot, for coming through."
01:59:52;01:59:53;"- You're welcome."
01:59:53;01:59:55;"- That's the only person to thank."
01:59:55;01:59:57;"Me and Jake will see you in a couple weeks."
01:59:57;01:59:57;"- Yep."
01:59:57;01:59:58;"- Peace."
01:59:58;02:00:02;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
