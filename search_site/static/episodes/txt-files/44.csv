00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles."
00:04;00:10;"I reconnect with Jake as we talk about Bernie Madoff and the Grateful Dead."
00:10;00:16;"We also answer listener emails and educate ourselves about the origins of 5-hour energy drink."
00:16;00:24;"All this, plus we count down the top 5 hits of 1967 and 2017."
00:24;00:26;"This is..."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:34;"Beats 1."
01:16;01:18;"Time Crisis, back in LA."
01:18;01:21;"Here with my LA co-host, Jake Longstrap."
01:21;01:23;"What's up, dude?"
01:23;01:24;"Not much, man."
01:24;01:28;"Jake, you just asked me an interesting question before the mics got turned on."
01:28;01:31;"Uh, have you done 5-hour energy drinks?"
01:31;01:33;"Tried or done?"
01:33;01:38;"Well, you phrased it as ""have you done,"" which makes it sound like heroin."
01:38;01:40;"Have you done 5-hour energy?"
01:40;01:43;"Have you ever done A&W cream soda?"
01:43;01:45;"Oh yeah."
01:45;01:50;"5-hour energy was kind of--it doesn't really feel like a beverage."
01:50;01:51;"Yeah."
01:51;01:54;"Like, Red Bull feels like an energy drink."
01:54;01:58;"5-hour energy feels like a mild drug."
01:58;02:00;"Yeah, like a shot of something."
02:00;02:03;"Right, because it's packaged in that funky little thing."
02:03;02:10;"I think I took one down once, but I've probably--you know, in my life, I've probably had like 43 Red Bulls."
02:10;02:12;"That's a fair amount."
02:12;02:15;"A thousand servings of Coke, easily."
02:15;02:16;"Coca-Cola."
02:16;02:17;"Oh yeah."
02:17;02:19;"More than that, man."
02:19;02:23;"Pepsi, a.k.a. Brad's drink, maybe like 11 times."
02:23;02:24;"No, no, hold on."
02:24;02:25;"Let's back up."
02:25;02:30;"On the Coca-Cola, when you were a kid, how many Cokes were you drinking?"
02:30;02:32;"There was none in the household."
02:32;02:33;"Okay."
02:33;02:39;"So at home--so I probably didn't actually sip on a Coke until I was like 7 or 8 years old over at somebody else's house."
02:39;02:40;"Right."
02:40;02:41;"And then, yeah."
02:41;02:43;"Okay, so teen years, you're going pretty light."
02:43;02:46;"You're going like maybe, what, 20 Cokes a year?"
02:46;02:47;"It's hard to say."
02:47;02:48;"50?"
02:48;02:50;"Like one a week when you're a teenager, like in high school?"
02:50;02:54;"Like you guys were like stopping by the deli, you get a Coke?"
02:54;02:59;"No, because when we would go to the deli, I would always get a peach Snapple."
02:59;03:01;"Oh, dude, Snapple."
03:01;03:04;"I was super into Snapple when I was in high school."
03:04;03:06;"They advertise on the Yankee games."
03:06;03:08;"Made from the best stuff on earth."
03:08;03:11;"Remember that Snapple was branded as like a New York beverage?"
03:11;03:12;"Totally."
03:12;03:15;"Because there was that lady, Wendy, who was like a real New Yorker."
03:15;03:17;"Yeah, I was so into Snapple."
03:17;03:18;"You know what's crazy?"
03:18;03:26;"Okay, 770 AM, WABC in New York had the Yankee games on, and they would advertise Snapple continuously."
03:26;03:30;"And they would advertise for a new radio show hosted by a guy named Rush Limbaugh."
03:30;03:31;"Wow."
03:31;03:37;"I remember just like fourth inning break, be like, ""WABC New York, Rush Limbaugh!"""
03:37;03:42;"And I would just be like, I remember that name was just in my consciousness when I was like 11."
03:42;03:44;"I'm just like, ""Who is Rush Limbaugh?"""
03:44;03:46;"Limbaugh. Such a funny name."
03:46;03:48;"Anyway, back to Snapple."
03:48;03:50;"Oh, no, back to your..."
03:50;03:52;"Okay, let's dial it all the way back."
03:52;03:55;"Annual Coke consumption circa 1998."
03:55;03:57;"Lifetime count."
03:57;03:58;"Servings."
03:58;04:01;"And occasionally you don't finish the can, obviously, but we're counting that."
04:01;04:05;"We're counting Diet Coke, Cherry Coke."
04:05;04:09;"Maybe a thousand isn't a bad guess."
04:09;04:11;"A lot of movie theater Cokes."
04:11;04:16;"Have you ever bought like a six pack of soda just to keep at home?"
04:16;04:18;"I mean, when I was younger, for sure."
04:18;04:20;"I used to buy 24 packs of Mountain Dew."
04:20;04:22;"Oh, why?"
04:22;04:24;"When I was in college, man."
04:24;04:25;"That was your fuel?"
04:25;04:31;"Me and my friend Jason Anderson would take the bus from our college campus in Portland to the Fred Meyer,"
04:31;04:35;"which is like the Vons of the Pacific Northwest."
04:35;04:37;"We'd each buy a cube."
04:37;04:39;"A cube meaning a 24 pack of..."
04:39;04:41;"Yeah, a cube. Mountain Dew cube."
04:41;04:45;"Circa 1996 and then get back on the bus with room temperature cubes."
04:45;04:46;"Yeah."
04:46;04:52;"And then we each had these mini fridges in our dorm rooms and we'd fill each fridge with Mountain Dews."
04:52;04:56;"And then reconvene in a few hours and just hang out and play guitar and drink Mountain Dew."
04:56;04:57;"It's really making me nostalgic."
04:57;05:02;"Not exactly a Chick magnet scene."
05:02;05:06;"These are the kind of experiences that kids today are missing out on."
05:06;05:08;"We would drink Mountain Dew like it was beer."
05:08;05:10;"We would slam like four Mountain Dews."
05:10;05:12;"Oh, you wouldn't get like a stomachache?"
05:12;05:13;"Probably. Yeah, kind of."
05:13;05:16;"You're 18. You're just like, ""What?"" It just goes right through you."

06:19;06:23;"Five Hour Energy has always been such a creepy brand to me."
06:23;06:26;"'Cause Five Hour Energy, it's like, you know,"
06:26;06:29;"like when you go to sometimes like a bodega or a truck stop"
06:29;06:33;"and they sell kind of like weird, like, sex drugs?"
06:33;06:35;"Right. Like, yeah, like in the bathroom."
06:35;06:38;"Yeah, or sometimes like right at the counter,"
06:38;06:41;"just like, trucker Viagra or something."
06:41;06:43;"And it's called like, sometimes it's like,"
06:43;06:47;"has this like faux Asian aesthetic, like tiger style."
06:47;06:50;"Okay. Take two of these and I don't know."
06:50;06:51;"Five Hour Energy just reminds me of that."
06:51;06:54;"Yeah, no, for sure. And yet it's like a massive thing."
06:54;06:55;"I wonder who owns Five Hour Energy."
06:55;06:57;"I think, well, we should look into that."
06:57;06:59;"I think it's like the amount that it's served in."
06:59;07:01;"It's like three ounces."
07:01;07:03;"That to me is like the weird part."
07:03;07:06;"So it's like condensed. It's almost like a syrup."
07:06;07:10;"Like if someone drank Red Bull in concentrate form."
07:10;07:12;"Okay, so Five Hour Energy."
07:12;07:13;"Wait, wait, hold on."
07:13;07:16;"Let me guess the year that it was introduced to the market."
07:16;07:17;"So Jake, what's your guess?"
07:17;07:18;"I'm going to say '02."
07:18;07:20;"That's a great guess."
07:20;07:21;"Thank you."
07:21;07:23;"It actually launched in 2003."
07:23;07:25;"Okay, I'm glad we looked this up."
07:25;07:30;"Cause you know, sometimes the feel good immigrant story,"
07:30;07:31;"I've mixed feelings about it."
07:31;07:33;"Cause I always love,"
07:33;07:36;"because we're all descended from immigrants."
07:36;07:40;"I always love to hear about an immigrant coming to America and making it big."
07:40;07:44;"Which we've discussed on this show many times."
07:44;07:46;"Right, because that's always this go-to thing."
07:46;07:49;"Like we talked about that, the Budweiser commercial."
07:49;07:50;"Right."
07:50;07:52;"That kind of dramatized a guy coming from Germany."
07:52;07:53;"Richard Montanez."
07:53;07:56;"Right. The janitor who created Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
07:56;07:58;"I love an immigrant who makes good."
07:58;08:02;"Now that said, this is kind of like the crisis of liberalism is like,"
08:02;08:05;"you know, got to have open borders."
08:05;08:06;"I believe in that."
08:06;08:08;"But at the same time,"
08:08;08:12;"often the stories that we celebrate of immigrants who came and made it in America,"
08:12;08:15;"it's never like this person left a war-torn place,"
08:15;08:20;"and now they help in America their child start working at the UN"
08:20;08:22;"to make sure that people don't suffer."
08:22;08:24;"The stories we always celebrate are like,"
08:24;08:26;"they came from poverty in another country."
08:26;08:29;"Not even necessarily poverty, but somebody came from another country."
08:29;08:32;"And this has been true forever, going back hundreds of years."
08:32;08:36;"It's like America is a place where you can come and make your dreams come true."
08:36;08:39;"And the dream that they always talk about is not like making the world a better place."
08:39;08:44;"It's always like making cold hard cash, building a brand."
08:44;08:50;"So anyway, I'm very happy to see that 5-Hour Energy Drink"
08:50;08:53;"is produced by Innovation Ventures, LLC."
08:53;08:54;"Great name."
08:54;08:57;"Which is a great name, Innovation Ventures."
08:57;09:01;"And the CEO is named Manoj Bhargava."
09:01;09:04;"He was born in Lucknow in India in 1953."
09:04;09:10;"And then at the age of 14, 1967, moved with his family to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
09:10;09:12;"So kind of opposite of Fresh Prince."
09:12;09:15;"And while he moved there, his dad went to the Wharton School of Business."
09:15;09:16;"Sick."
09:16;09:18;"At University of Pennsylvania."
09:18;09:19;"With?"
09:19;09:21;"With Donald Trump, probably."
09:21;09:22;"Actually, that might have been the same time."
09:22;09:24;"Yeah, I think Trump was like late 60s."
09:24;09:27;"Trump was 70, so he probably graduated college in like 70."
09:27;09:31;"That was this guy's dad, but then he won a math scholarship"
09:31;09:33;"to an elite private academy called the Hill School."
09:33;09:36;"And after he graduated, he went to Princeton."
09:36;09:38;"That's a cool story."
09:38;09:40;"Yeah, coming generation."
09:40;09:41;"That's what you want to hear."
09:41;09:42;"Yeah, that's quick."
09:42;09:43;"That's quick."
09:43;09:46;"And then anyway, so then he starts Innovation Ventures, LLC,"
09:46;09:49;"and he launches 5-Hour Energy in 2003."
09:49;09:53;"So he was like 50 at that point."
09:53;09:54;"He was born in '53?"
09:54;09:55;"Yeah, he was 50."
09:55;09:56;"Interesting."
09:56;09:59;"And then in less than 10 years,"
09:59;10:05;"5-Hour Energy had grown to an estimated $1 billion market cap."
10:05;10:06;"Wow."
10:06;10:08;"Now this guy's a billionaire."
10:08;10:10;"A 5-Hour Energy."
10:10;10:12;"Here's what's cool about him."
10:12;10:17;"In 2015, he pledged to give 99% of his wealth to philanthropic causes."
10:17;10:18;"Dope."
10:18;10:20;"Shout out to you, Manoj Bhargava."
01:45:27;01:45:35;"Gotta be careful with the concept of a supreme being because it kind of takes away the agency from the other humans in your life."
01:45:35;01:45:41;"You're not even saying ""thank you, baby,"" you're saying ""thank you to the Lord our God for creating you for me."""
01:45:41;01:45:48;"That's just a funny idea, like, attributing divine inspiration to like the most banal things."
01:45:49;01:46:06;"Like, ""Hey, I just invented this new beverage. I work at 7-Eleven. You take ice, you put some food coloring, some flavoring in there, blend it real fine, and call it a Slurpee."""
01:46:06;01:46:10;"But it was divinely inspired by you."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"Well, that's the classic--"
01:46:12;01:46:17;"I mean, that's kind of-- Groovin' is like a great song, but it is kind of the Slurpee of like--"
01:46:18;01:46:21;"It's like the classic thing, like when you win the Super Bowl and it's like, ""I want to thank God."""
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Right, JC."
01:46:23;01:46:30;"""I want to thank God for enacting your divine retribution against the Denver Broncos. Clearly I've done something in my life to please you."""
01:46:30;01:46:32;"And the Denver Broncos didn't."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Brutal."
01:46:34;01:46:40;"The Groovin' of 2017 is ""Despacito."" Remember this one, Jake?"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"No."
01:46:42;01:46:47;"I guess it's kind of getting safe to say this is more the song of the summer than ""I'm the One."" This is the song of the summer, I think."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"This is the-- Bieber's on this, right?"
01:46:50;01:46:53;"Yeah, he's on the remix, which is what's breaking it in America."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"Is this the remix?"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"Yeah."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"That's him, right?"
01:46:59;01:47:08;"This is the first time a Spanish-language song has topped the Top 100 charts since ""The Macarena"" in '96."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Okay."
01:47:11;01:47:17;"Luis Fonsi. Bieber wanted to record a remix version after seeing how people reacted to ""Despacito"" in a Colombian club."
01:47:17;01:47:21;"That's really hard for me to believe. I don't want to be a hater, but like..."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"When was Bieber in a Colombian club?"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"Well, I'll give him props if that's true."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"You know that song?"
01:48:00;01:48:04;"That must be tough for you, Jake, as an Eagles fan who loves the tasteful palate of '70s rock."
01:48:04;01:48:09;"Every time you hear the syllable ""des,"" you're waiting for ""sperado."""
01:48:09;01:48:13;"You're hoping, but it's ""pacito."""
01:48:27;01:48:32;"What does that mean? ""Ride fences?"""
01:48:32;01:48:34;"I don't know."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Uh-oh."
01:48:36;01:48:39;"""Mending fences"" would not really work."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"Yeah, ""desperado"" doesn't mean ""fences."""
01:48:43;01:48:44;"""Jumping fences."""
01:48:44;01:48:46;"""Digging post holes."""
01:48:46;01:48:48;"""Jumping fences."""
01:48:48;01:48:50;"""Cutting holes through fences."""
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Alright, Jake, what do you think won? '67 or 2017?"
01:48:54;01:48:58;"This was the worst top five of all time."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"And I had high hopes going in."
01:49:00;01:49:04;"Yeah, man, you thought '67 was going to be popping. It wasn't."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"I guess I gotta go '67."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Really?"
01:49:08;01:49:11;"I mean, it sucked, but ""Respect"" and ""Groovin'."""
01:49:12;01:49:13;"That's my inspiration of ""Groovin'."""
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Just 'cause of that tasteful palate?"
01:49:15;01:49:19;"I didn't have much on there for '17. What about you, man?"
01:49:19;01:49:24;"""Despacito"" is the only one of the top five that I'll admit is really, like, I really feel."
01:49:24;01:49:29;"I was very happy we got to learn about Jake Paul and Team 10 in his song ""It's Every Day, Bro."""
01:49:29;01:49:33;"And I always think it's cool to see people disrupting the music industry."
01:49:33;01:49:40;"'Cause back in the day, you didn't hear about YouTubers getting up there on the iTunes charts."
01:49:41;01:49:45;"Shout out to him for that disruption, but I don't know if I love the song."
01:49:45;01:49:52;"I think they're both bad. I think comparing them has given me a pessimistic view of world history."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"You know who won? Rusty Cage."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Of Soundgarden?"
01:49:56;01:50:02;"Maybe that's a good note to end on, 'cause we didn't get to talk about Chris Cornell last week."
01:50:02;01:50:09;"So, Jake, we had a few music industry deaths recently, the most recent of which was Greg Allman."
01:50:10;01:50:19;"I know you're a fan because at your birthday, your last birthday, you and members of your Grateful Dead cover band Dick Picks got together to do some covers."
01:50:19;01:50:21;"I sang ""Eagle Song"" with you guys."
01:50:21;01:50:24;"And as I recall, you guys did an Allman Brothers song."
01:50:24;01:50:29;"Yeah, we did ""Blue Sky,"" which was written by Dickie Betts, but, you know, classic Allman Brothers song."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"Greg played on it."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"So you're an Allman Brothers fan."
01:50:33;01:50:38;"For people who don't know, they're kind of like the Grateful Dead. They're just more Southern."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"Yeah, in the sense that they were like..."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"They would jam. They're known to jam."
01:50:43;01:50:53;"Yeah, fully improvised. For people interested, check out ""Mountain Jam"" on the Eat a Peach album. It's like a 25-minute jam. It's beautiful."
01:50:53;01:51:08;"And they would write songs that would draw from jazz, blues, country, kind of how the dead would take all the classic American forms of music and cobble them together to make their own sound."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"The Allmans did that too, just with a different aesthetic."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"Instead of California hippie, it was like Southern hippie."
01:51:14;01:51:17;"I love the Allman Brothers. Yeah, beautiful."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"So what's a good song to play as a tribute to Greg?"
01:51:20;01:51:24;"How about ""Melissa""? He wrote that one. Beautiful song."
01:51:24;01:51:30;"Alright, great call. Let's go out with Allman Brothers, Melissa, RIP Greg Allman, and we'll see you in two weeks."
01:51:35;01:51:42;"Crossroads seem to come and go"
01:51:42;01:51:50;"Gypsy glide on the coast of gold"
01:51:50;01:51:56;"Knowing many loving none"
01:51:56;01:52:01;"Bearing sorrow, having fun"
01:52:04;01:52:10;"But back home you'll always run to sweet Melissa"
01:52:10;01:52:28;"Great train, each car looks the same"
01:52:33;01:52:36;"No one knows the gypsy's name"
01:52:36;01:52:43;"No one hears his lonely sigh"
01:52:43;01:52:48;"There are no blankets where he lies"
01:52:48;01:52:54;"Loving deep is dreams of the gypsy's mind"
01:52:54;01:52:57;"But sweet Melissa"
01:53:02;01:53:12;"Again the morning's come, again he's on the run"
01:53:12;01:53:18;"Sunbeams shining through his hair, fail not to have a care"
01:53:19;01:53:27;"Pick up your gear and gypsy roll on, roll on"
01:53:27;01:53:37;"Crossroads, will you ever let him go?"
01:53:37;01:53:46;"Will you hide the dead man's ghost?"
01:53:48;01:53:52;"All the many lies beneath the plain"
01:53:52;01:53:58;"Will his spirit float away?"
01:53:58;01:54:06;"But I know he won't stay without Melissa"
01:54:06;01:54:17;"Yes, I know that he won't stay without Melissa"
01:54:23;01:54:27;"No one knows the gypsy's name"
01:54:27;01:54:34;"No one hears his lonely sigh"
01:54:34;01:54:41;"There are no blankets where he lies"
01:54:41;01:54:49;"Loving deep is dreams of the gypsy's mind"
01:54:55;01:55:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"Whoa, hold on Jake, we can't leave yet."
01:55:08;01:55:09;"Really?"
01:55:09;01:55:13;"'Cause this just in, we got a piece of physical mail."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"What?"
01:55:14;01:55:19;"I don't even know how this person figured out where to mail it to, but something came for Time Crisis."
01:55:19;01:55:22;"It's from Kenny in Costa Mesa, California."
01:55:22;01:55:27;"And I really like this letter, and I want to introduce Kenny,"
01:55:27;01:55:33;"because he took the time to literally, this is, literally lined paper written by hand."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"It's a long letter."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"It's a long letter. I just want to read the beginning."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"In pencil, with no cross-outs."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Yeah, very few, no, no cross-outs."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"He had to recopy that."
01:55:40;01:55:43;"So I just want to read the beginning of Kenny's letter."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"To whom it may concern from Time Crisis."
01:55:46;01:55:49;"First off, thank you so much for the Crisis Crew card."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"My card resides in my wallet."
01:55:51;01:56:00;"Now for anybody who doesn't know, True Crisis Heads got Crisis Crew cards designed by Seinfeld 2000."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"If you missed the boat, you gotta keep your eyes peeled."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Follow Time Crisis 2000 on Twitter."
01:56:05;01:56:10;"Now since I am now officially part of the Crisis Crew and follow the 11 core values,"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"I would like to know what in the hell these values are."
01:56:12;01:56:17;"Seriously, please, if it's some weird stuff, I'd like to know along with many others."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"Fair enough."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Seinfeld 2000, you're gonna have to--"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"Valid point."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"--eventually reveal what the 11 core values are."
01:56:24;01:56:27;"Also, I would like to have an inquiry if that is alright."
01:56:27;01:56:32;"I feel there is no real youth opinions shared on the show, seeing as everyone in the studio is over 30."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"40."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"In some cases, 40."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"I am 14."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I go to middle school, currently 8th grade,"
01:56:39;01:56:43;"and I feel I can reach valid teen discussion points in a factual manner."
01:56:43;01:56:47;"I go to school in a place where everyone is a clone of what is popular."
01:56:47;01:56:49;"I am cooler than that."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"Last year I was grunge."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"That's the only typical phase I've been through."
01:56:53;01:56:56;"I only wear cool stuff and listen to underground music."
01:56:56;01:57:01;"Some of the artists I listen to include Waves, Tame Impala, Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, The Strokes, Rihanna,"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"la la la, a lot of people."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"I like good music."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Also, yeah, of course I like Vampire Weekend."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Okay, I'm sold."
01:57:07;01:57:11;"I'm not going to read the whole letter, but Kenny, you're right, man."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"First of all, I'm very fascinated that you went through a grunge phase."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"Yep, I want to hear more about that."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"In the year of our Lord 2017."
01:57:17;01:57:20;"I know Jake is going to appreciate that tasteful grunge palette."
01:57:20;01:57:22;"And you're right, man."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"We don't get enough youth opinion on this show."
01:57:24;01:57:27;"And we compare a lot of years."
01:57:27;01:57:29;"We should have Kenny call in."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"What was the phrase he used?"
01:57:30;01:57:35;"Valid youth viewpoint on a number of factual--"
01:57:35;01:57:38;"He says he can reach valid teen discussion points in a factual manner."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"That is a great phrase."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"That's a well-written--"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"I like that because we need more facts."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"Valid teen discussion points in a factual manner."
01:57:46;01:57:51;"Kenny, you have piqued our curiosity big time."
01:57:51;01:57:55;"I really think it's cool that you wrote us a real letter."
01:57:55;01:57:59;"So, Kenny, we're going to figure out a way to get in touch with you."
01:57:59;01:58:04;"Maybe tweet @TimeCrisis2000 to make it a little easier on us."
01:58:04;01:58:07;"But, Kenny, we want you calling in because--"
01:58:07;01:58:08;"Shout out to you."
01:58:08;01:58:11;"We do want your teen opinion on this show."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"So hopefully we can get in touch with you by the next episode."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"Send me an email."
01:58:14;01:58:16;"Or send Jake an email, Kenny."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"Hopefully you're listening."
01:58:18;01:58:19;"Okay, we'll see you in two weeks."
01:58:19;01:58:23;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kain."
01:58:23;01:58:27;"Beats 1."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"(explosion)"
