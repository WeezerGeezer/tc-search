00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. Today we have an epic episode. We'll be talking"
00:08;00:15;"about old dudes and snack foods. Whether Flaming Hot Cheetos, Fritos, Bruce"
00:15;00:23;"Springsteen, or Phil Collins. This is a major episode. I hope you're sitting down."
00:23;00:26;"This is..."
00:26;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ed's Rocking Bee Bee Bee Bee Bee Bee Bee Spore One."
00:33;00:47;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war I felt, war being me. All my rightful chances."
00:47;01:01;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the floor. One of us had to go."
01:01;01:11;"Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:11;01:17;"Leave it on me babe."
01:17;01:28;"Welcome back to Time Crisis. Got a hell of a show today. This show is really focusing on two Time Crisis classic topics."
01:28;01:38;"Classic rock, and corporate history. We'll be hitting them both from different angles, the way they intersect."
01:38;01:46;"I'm here joined by Jake. What's up Jake? So we just ate some tacos, but when I came into the studio,"
01:46;01:53;"somebody got a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos. We talked on the last episode a lot about the history of Flaming Hot Cheetos."
01:53;01:59;"I think it's possible I've never actually had any. Have you? Richard Montanez. Richard Montanez invented them."
01:59;02:04;"Credited with the invention. No, I've never had them. Alright, I think maybe to start off the show we should just open it."
02:04;02:10;"Have you had regular Cheetos? Up on the mic. Up on the mic. Yeah, I've had Cheetos."
02:10;02:19;"Alright, so maybe we'll each take a handful. You grab a few. I have to stretch to get it because this table is so huge here at Apple Studios in Culver City."
02:19;02:28;"So I'm looking at the Cheetos. They're very red. Mmm."
02:28;02:36;"Okay, pretty mild initially. Yeah, that's not Flaming Hot. Maybe we got a defective bag. It lingers."
02:36;02:46;"I would barely even call that hot, let alone Flaming Hot. Yeah, I mean, if you were like 14, maybe that would blow your mind,"
02:46;02:56;"but I've been putting Tabasco and hot sauce on eggs and things for like 25 years, so kind of like Chris Bayo style."
02:56;03:03;"My level of hot is like ratcheted way up. But if you're like 12 or 14, those Cheetos might blow your mind."
03:03;03:08;"If you've never had anything spicy before? It does kind of linger. Honestly, if you..."
03:08;03:21;"Do you have to? Do you have to let it linger? I think if somebody told me those are regular Cheetos and I just like grabbed a handful at a party or event,"
03:21;03:27;"I wouldn't even think twice. Right. Maybe we got a defective bag. Doubt it, dude."
03:27;03:33;"So that's how hot Flaming Hot Cheetos are. Is there a step above? Ratcheted up a notch, dudes."
03:33;03:43;"Like crazy Flaming Hot? Probably. Three alarm, five alarm. Anyway, today's show is not about Flaming Hot Cheetos."
03:43;03:46;"I'm not going to eat any more. You're not going to eat any more? No."
03:46;03:52;"We also got some Fritos. Some Fritos scoops. I will talk about that later."
04:07;04:12;"Let's get right into it, Matt. Got a lot of stuff on the docket today. Yeah."
04:12;04:20;"Just to kick things off, a very disturbing story. Yeah? Involving Time Crisis favorite, Phil Collins."
04:20;04:30;"Now, if I just asked you to guess who's more of a chill dude, Phil Collins or Paul McCartney, without any info, what would your gut tell you?"
04:30;04:35;"Paul. Yeah, Paul in the Beatles. He was known as like kind of the sweet-natured one. Yeah."
04:35;04:48;"Kind of all-around nice guy. And as discussed on earlier episodes of the show, Phil has an incredibly conflicted and self-conscious relationship with his previous career."
04:48;04:59;"Yeah. He retired because he felt embarrassed and shamed by his emotionally outward '80s material."
04:59;05:03;"He felt that everybody thought Phil Collins was uncool. Right."
05:03;05:10;"So here's this poor guy living in Switzerland, collecting Civil War memorabilia. That's a real fact. Yeah."
05:10;05:15;"That's what Phil's into. And just feeling like the whole world hates him, where it couldn't be further from the truth."
05:15;05:21;"And a whole new generation of kids think ""In the Air Tonight"" is one of the greatest songs of all time. But anyway."
05:21;05:24;"So he does not seem chill. And Paul seems like an all-around nice guy."
05:24;05:27;"Actually, I think about it. I met Paul McCartney briefly once. Oh, yeah?"
05:27;05:35;"It was at an industry event. Industry event. You know, I'm an industry professional. So I was at an industry event."
05:35;05:39;"Was this the barbecue that John Cougar Mellencamp was at? No, although that's a whole 'nother story."
05:39;05:47;"I don't think I actually got to meet JCM at that party. I think maybe I briefly met his girlfriend."
05:47;05:49;"Christy Brinkley. Christy Brinkley. Yeah."
05:49;05:57;"No, this was at, there was this big Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary show. Oh, okay. I remember that."
05:57;06:02;"You had to wear a tuxedo. You went to that? I went to that. Jeez. And you know who my date was?"
06:02;06:06;"Do I know them? Yeah. Should I know them? It's a man."
06:06;06:13;"A musician? Yeah. Very closely associated with time crisis. East Coast."
06:13;06:19;"Oh, Despot? Yeah. What? You and Despot were in tuxes. I had a plus one."
06:19;06:24;"I had a plus one. So me and Despot. All due respect to Despot, but for some reason the way you phrased that,"
06:24;06:29;"it made it sound like you were someone's plus one. And I was like, oh, you were Despot's plus one."
06:29;06:33;"No, no, no. I'm pretty sure they invited everybody who'd ever been on the show before."
06:33;06:38;"That's right. Of course. You've played on it three times. Three times. We're SNL veterans."
06:38;06:43;"That's deep, dude. I'll tell you one quick story about SNL. Now we're three Inception levels deep."
06:43;06:50;"We're going to get back to Phil Collins. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, so my mom loves to go to sleep early."
06:50;06:55;"And in fact, the previous times when we played SNL and I'd be like, Mom, you want to come to the show?"
06:55;07:00;"She'd always be like, what time does it start? 1130? She'd be like, can I come to the dress rehearsal?"
07:00;07:07;"I can go home and go to sleep. And I'd be like, all right. So the third time we played, my mom comes,"
07:07;07:12;"she watches the dress rehearsal, and then you have 30, 40 minutes before the real one starts."
07:12;07:17;"And then we got like a lot of buddies are there. It's like a fun, exciting atmosphere."
07:17;07:21;"And before she takes off, she comes to say hi and she's kind of hanging backstage."
07:21;07:26;"And, you know, so she's hanging with the band and management and friends are there."
07:26;07:31;"Then as it gets closer and closer to the show, you know, there's all this excitement and they're like filming"
07:31;07:35;"an opening bit right outside the dressing room door. And I'm kind of like, all right, Mom, well,"
07:35;07:39;"do you want somebody to take you down and get you in a car? And she was like, well, I don't know,"
07:39;07:42;"maybe I'll stay for the beginning of the show. And I was like, all right."
07:42;07:49;"So then the energy of just like being on live TV, that SNL energy, she ends up staying for the entire show."
07:49;07:53;"Then she comes to the after party. Your mom's going deep. My mom's going deep."
07:53;07:57;"She has like a like a sip of alcohol. She feels drunk."
07:57;08:01;"She's like talking with like Cousin Asher, like she and Ross have a conversation."
08:01;08:06;"The course is like at the SNL after party and three in the morning when all said and done,"
08:06;08:09;"it's like three in the morning. And I remember she was having a great time."
08:09;08:13;"And I was like, and this is somebody who literally was trying to get in bed by 11, you know,"
08:13;08:16;"a woman in her 60s. And I remember at the end of that, I said, Mom,"
08:16;08:23;"when's the last time you stayed up until three a.m.? And she said, no irony, the 70s."
08:23;08:26;"It was just that live TV energy."
08:27;08:30;"Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine."
08:30;08:34;"Looked up in the heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign written by a cross in heaven."
08:34;08:39;"Lady black and white, get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight."
08:39;08:43;"Hey, Saturday night."
08:43;08:49;"One more Saturday night."
08:49;08:52;"Hey, Saturday night."
08:53;08:58;"Everybody's dancing down the local armory,"
08:58;09:01;"with a basement full of dynamite, live artillery."
09:01;09:04;"And we're chooky rising, everybody getting high."
09:04;09:08;"Come the rocket stroke at midnight, I'm stolen by a cloud."
09:08;09:11;"Hey, Saturday night."
09:11;09:17;"One more Saturday night."
09:17;09:20;"Hey, Saturday night."
09:23;09:46;"Okay, so anyway, back one layer."
09:46;09:50;"SNL 40th anniversary, not performing, just in the crowd."
09:50;09:53;"Despot and I were in tuxedos."
09:53;09:56;"God, I wish I had some--the more I think back on that--"
09:56;09:57;"That's so funny."
09:57;10:01;"Just sitting in the freezing--what is it, Studio 8A?"
10:01;10:05;"You know, like Larry David and Paul Simon, all these people there."
10:05;10:09;"And then there's a crazy afterparty at the Plaza Hotel."
10:09;10:12;"It was really wild, Prince, you know, rest in peace."
10:12;10:13;"Played?"
10:13;10:15;"Yeah, yeah, it was like a jam session."
10:15;10:16;"It was really fun."
10:16;10:17;"A lot of buddies were there."
10:17;10:19;"Ariel was there with Haim."
10:19;10:21;"It was a good vibe."
10:21;10:26;"So at some point--and, you know, I've learned my lesson from--"
10:26;10:29;"about not really going up to legends."
10:29;10:34;"Either you meet them in a natural way, but what's the best thing that's going to happen?"
10:34;10:39;"Paul McCartney was walking around, and we were standing right behind some dudes"
10:39;10:44;"who were just kind of like--somebody was like, ""Oh, excuse me, sir, Paul."
10:44;10:46;"You know, gotta say, man."""
10:46;10:47;"You called him ""Sir Paul""?"
10:47;10:48;"I don't even remember who it was."
10:48;10:53;"It was somebody we weren't even with who was kind of just like, ""Hey, Paul,"
10:53;10:55;"I just gotta say, man, you're a legend."
10:55;10:56;"Love your music."""
10:56;10:57;"Yeah, no shit."
10:57;10:58;"Yeah, something like that."
10:58;11:01;"And he was just kind of like, ""Oh, nice to meet you, nice to meet you."""
11:01;11:04;"And I think me and Ariel were literally just standing behind these dudes,"
11:04;11:06;"and he just kind of thought we were in the same circle."
11:06;11:08;"He went so out of his way to shake hands with everybody"
11:08;11:12;"that he kind of pushed through these guys to see us two random dorks,"
11:12;11:15;"and he was kind of like, ""Oh, nice to meet you, nice to meet you."""
11:15;11:18;"And then me and Ariel looked at each other like, ""Whoa."""
11:18;11:19;"Wow."
11:19;11:21;"So anyway, we were kind of like, ""All right, this is a nice guy,"""
11:21;11:25;"because a lot of people, these legendary entertainers,"
11:25;11:28;"especially as they get up there, you know, men are known to get cranky."
11:28;11:30;"Yeah, Bob Dylan's not going to have that vibe."
11:30;11:31;"Highly doubt it."
11:31;11:32;"Nor is Mick Jagger."
11:32;11:34;"Yeah, if somebody stops Bob Dylan at a party,"
11:34;11:37;"there's no way he's going to go out of his way to shake hands with everybody."
11:37;11:38;"Yeah."
11:38;11:40;"""Hey, good to meet you, man."""
11:40;11:45;"We ever see Bob Dylan at a party, he's like, ""Oh, Bob, I got to say, man,"
11:45;11:47;"hell of a songwriter."""
11:47;11:48;"Just like--"
11:48;11:50;"Your lyrics--"
11:50;11:51;"I just got to say, Bob--"
11:51;11:53;"--have touched a generation."
11:53;11:59;"Mr. Dylan, I just got to say, ""Blown in the Wind"" changed my life, man."
11:59;12:00;"Hell of a song."
12:00;12:04;"So anyway, that's my one lame Paul McCartney story,"
12:04;12:08;"but it's like--I was kind of impressed that this dude,"
12:08;12:11;"not in an egotistical way, but I think if you're Paul McCartney,"
12:11;12:15;"it's like being--it's a certain level of fame that you probably know that"
12:15;12:19;"anybody you shake hands with, it's going to be a fun little moment for them,"
12:19;12:21;"and he wasn't stingy about it."
12:21;12:22;"I was like, ""You know, that's a nice guy."
12:22;12:26;"He knows who he is and whatever."""
12:26;12:29;"But now we're back to the original story."
12:29;12:31;"Apparently Phil Collins didn't feel that way."
12:31;12:32;"What happened?"
12:32;12:33;"So imagine you're Phil Collins."
12:33;12:34;"Okay."
12:34;12:35;"What year are we talking?"
12:35;12:36;"2002."
12:36;12:39;"But this information just recently came out in an interview."
12:39;12:43;"So first of all, Phil Collins is a different generation than Paul McCartney."
12:43;12:46;"So Phil Collins would have been a kid when the Beatles hit."
12:46;12:49;"Phil Collins was in the film ""Help."""
12:49;12:50;"Oh, right."
12:50;12:52;"He was like 12 or 14 or something."
12:52;12:53;"Oh, right, that's a fun fact."
12:53;12:54;"He's like a young kid."
12:54;12:59;"So, you know, to him, the Beatles--it's not like he's Mick Jagger"
12:59;13:01;"and these are his contemporaries."
13:01;13:05;"He probably thinks of the Beatles not dissimilarly from how we think of the Beatles."
13:05;13:06;"Yeah."
13:06;13:08;"Or how we think about, like, Kurt."
13:08;13:09;"Sure."
13:09;13:10;"Tupac."
13:10;13:11;"Sure."
13:11;13:15;"So I'm sad to say Phil Collins has revealed a secret 14-year feud"
13:15;13:18;"with his one-time hero, Paul McCartney."
13:18;13:24;"The musician has told the Sunday Times that he's held a grudge against the Beatles star"
13:24;13:28;"ever since Sir Paul supposedly made a condescending remark backstage"
13:28;13:32;"at a Buckingham Palace gig."
13:32;13:33;"So picture that."
13:33;13:34;"Cool gig."
13:34;13:37;"For British people, man, you know, Buckingham Palace, that's like their heritage."
13:37;13:38;"Yeah."
13:38;13:40;"That's like you or me--"
13:40;13:41;"Playing the White House."
13:41;13:45;"Playing the White House, you know, or like being at the Alamo."
13:45;13:46;"Wearing a tux."
13:46;13:51;"It's like you and me being in Philly at the Liberty Bell and Tupac's there and Kurt."
13:51;13:56;"So anyway, just to put this in perspective, for British people, you know, that's their queen."
13:56;13:57;"That's their divine ruler."
13:57;13:58;"No joke."
13:59;14:05;"So you're Phil Collins, already the world's been kind of unfair to you as previously discussed."
14:05;14:12;"So the former Genesis frontman, 65, admits he stopped being a fan of Sir Paul, 74,"
14:12;14:16;"when they both took part in the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations back in 2002."
14:16;14:18;"This is getting deeper and deeper, man."
14:18;14:21;"Not only are they at Buckingham Palace, this is the Queen's Golden Jubilee."
14:21;14:22;"What's that?"
14:22;14:25;"I think that means that she'd been queen for, I'm guessing, 50 years."
14:25;14:26;"Wow."
14:26;14:27;"I think she probably--"
14:27;14:28;"'52 to '02."
14:28;14:29;"'02."
14:29;14:30;"Yeah."
14:30;14:31;"Jeez Louise."
14:31;14:35;"That would be like, for us, man, like, you know, Bill Clinton's 100th birthday."
14:35;14:36;"100."
14:36;14:39;"That's like you and me being down in Little Rock for Bill's 100th birthday."
14:39;14:41;"That's going to happen, dude."
14:41;14:43;"We'll be there in tuxes."
14:43;14:44;"Yeah."
14:44;14:45;"He'll-- wait."
14:45;14:46;"He'll be 100."
14:46;14:50;"How old will we be, like, in our 70s or something?"
14:50;14:52;"We'll now--"
14:52;14:53;"Something."
14:54;14:55;"I don't know."
14:55;14:56;"Next season's 70s."
14:56;14:58;"Next season, this is what happened."
14:58;15:03;"Phil alleges that when he asked Sir Paul, who was with his then-wife,"
15:03;15:08;"Heather Mills, to sign a copy of Hunter Davies' book, The Beatles,"
15:08;15:11;"he was met with a patronizing response."
15:11;15:14;"So Phil, I guess, brought a copy of a book about The Beatles"
15:14;15:16;"to the Queen's Golden Jubilee."
15:16;15:18;"Strange, but not that strange."
15:18;15:19;"Whatever."
15:19;15:23;"I said, ""Hey, Paul, do you mind signing this for me?"""
15:23;15:28;"He said, ""Oh, Heather, our little Phil's a bit of a Beatles fan,"""
15:28;15:30;"the singer told the Sunday Times."
15:30;15:31;"Little Phil."
15:31;15:38;"And I thought, ""You [bleep] You [bleep] Never forgot it."""
15:38;15:40;"He went on to say, ""McCartney was one of my heroes."""
15:40;15:44;"But he has this thing when he's talking to you where he makes you feel like,"
15:44;15:46;"""I know this must be hard for you because I'm a Beatle."
15:46;15:48;"I'm Paul McCartney, and it must be very hard for you"
15:48;15:52;"to actually be holding a conversation with me."""
15:52;15:54;"Okay, lots of back there, man."
15:54;15:55;"Okay."
15:55;15:58;"Is Phil reading too far into it?"
15:58;15:59;"That is condescending."
15:59;16:02;"That's a terrible look for Phil in two ways."
16:02;16:06;"One, bringing the book."
16:06;16:07;"Phil Collins is a legend."
16:07;16:11;"Okay, this reflects so profoundly on his psychology."
16:11;16:12;"He's a legend."
16:12;16:15;"If you're a legend, you don't go to the other legend and say,"
16:15;16:17;"""Can I get your autograph?"""
16:17;16:21;"David Bowie is not rolling up to James Brown and being like,"
16:21;16:22;"""Can I get your autograph?"""
16:22;16:24;"No, there's no way."
16:24;16:30;"You hang out, you have a drink, you socialize, you be cool."
16:30;16:33;"Be cool, man."
16:33;16:37;"And so he screwed himself with that."
16:37;16:39;"And so Paul, I think, probably recognized the dynamic there."
16:39;16:43;"It was kind of funny that this other rock star was bringing a book for him to sign."
16:43;16:45;"That's kind of funny."
16:45;16:47;"And so, yeah, Paul played with it a little bit."
16:47;16:53;"And then Phil's reaction is so overboard for Paul, like, reasonably being like,"
16:53;16:54;"""Come on, man."
16:54;16:56;"What are you, like a 60-year-old dude asking me for an autograph?"
16:56;16:57;"Come on."""
16:57;16:58;"Well, hold on."
16:58;16:59;"I'm fully on with Paul."
16:59;17:00;"It was like--"
17:00;17:01;"Okay, well, hold on."
17:01;17:03;"--disrespectful in the most mild way."
17:03;17:09;"First of all, back then, Phil would have been 51 and Paul would have been 60."
17:09;17:10;"Okay."
17:10;17:14;"And second of all, we weren't there, so we don't know exactly what the tone was."
17:14;17:17;"Those ages don't redefine the tenor of the story."
17:17;17:19;"I don't think the age should matter there."
17:19;17:27;"Let's say that Paul literally said this, ""Oh, Heather, our little Phil's a bit of a Beatles fan."""
17:27;17:28;"That is condescending."
17:28;17:30;"Okay, I don't believe that he said ""little."""
17:30;17:32;"I think Phil added that."
17:32;17:35;"That's my call."
17:35;17:38;"Based on Phil's bitter psychology--"
17:38;17:39;"We're never going to know."

17:48;17:49;"Fire it up."
17:49;17:50;"Our little Phil."
17:50;17:52;"I'm probably going to sound more like Ringo."
17:52;17:54;"Wait, the Liverpool melody is like--"

17:56;17:57;"Yeah."
17:57;17:59;"It's me, Paul."

18:02;18:04;"[laughs]"
18:04;18:11;"Oh, Heather, our little Phil seems our little Phil's a bit of a Beatles fan."
18:11;18:12;"Oh, no, this is terrible."
18:12;18:13;"I'm sorry."
18:13;18:15;"I apologize to all people from Liverpool."

24:25;24:27;"except it is for old people."
24:27;24:29;"Here's a few interesting things about it."
24:29;24:35;"The headliners were Paul, Bob Dylan, Neil Young,"
24:35;24:38;"some version of Pink Floyd, who else?"
24:38;24:39;"Stones."
24:39;24:41;"Rolling Stones."
24:41;24:42;"The who."
24:42;24:43;"And the who."
24:43;24:45;"The last night of that festival looked brutal,"
24:45;24:48;"'cause it was Roger Waters and the who."
24:48;24:49;"Not a fan."
24:49;24:52;"Which are the bottom two of those six."
24:52;24:53;"Some may beg to differ."
24:53;24:57;"I like the who, but I don't need to see the who in 2016."
24:57;24:58;"That's terrible."
24:58;24:59;"Rest in peace."
24:59;25:02;"Won't get fooled again!"
25:02;25:05;"Can you imagine, like, an 18-minute version of Won't Get Fooled Again in 2016?"
25:05;25:07;"I don't know, man."
25:07;25:09;"But--"
25:09;25:11;"So those were the headliners."
25:11;25:15;"And I knew some people go--my cousin texted me that she was there."
25:15;25:18;"I think some other associates were there."
25:18;25:19;"For all three nights?"
25:19;25:20;"I think so."
25:20;25:23;"And so my first question was, I'm picturing Old Chella,"
25:23;25:26;"and I'm picturing this is Coachella for old people."
25:26;25:30;"And having played Coachella many times,"
25:30;25:33;"even having gone just to hang out before."
25:33;25:34;"Never been."
25:34;25:35;"Oh, really?"
25:35;25:36;"Yeah."
25:36;25:39;"So in Coachella, you have your headliners, you have the main stage,"
25:39;25:42;"then you have this second stage, you have three tents,"
25:42;25:44;"then you have house parties."
25:44;25:46;"So there's lots of music going at any time,"
25:46;25:49;"and there's a tent that's more dance music oriented."
25:49;25:51;"You know, there's lots and lots of stuff."
25:51;25:55;"Everybody's seen the famous Coachella poster that has all the artists."
25:55;25:57;"Like 100 artists."
25:57;25:59;"So I was kind of thinking, like, whoa, Old Chella."
25:59;26:00;"So we know who the headliners are."
26:00;26:02;"Who's going to be playing in the tent?"
26:02;26:07;"And I was like, Moby Grape, like Dan Fogelberg."
26:07;26:08;"You know, I was just picturing --"
26:08;26:09;"Strawberry Alarm Clock."
26:09;26:10;"Exactly."
26:10;26:14;"I was just kind of, like, picturing who are, like, the lesser bands"
26:14;26:16;"from the '60s and '70s."
26:16;26:20;"Like Grand Funk, Railroad reuniting to headline the second stage."
26:20;26:21;"Oh, my God."
26:21;26:23;"So I was picturing it, and I was, like, really curious."
26:23;26:28;"And then I was texting with one of my guys who was out there,"
26:28;26:30;"and I was like, so, man, what's, like, the tent scene like?"
26:30;26:31;"And he's like, what do you mean?"
26:31;26:33;"And I was like, you know, who are you seeing, like, during the day?"
26:33;26:36;"And he was like, dude, there's literally no artists other than the six"
26:36;26:38;"headliners."
26:38;26:39;"There was no music during the day."
26:39;26:40;"Yeah."
26:40;26:41;"There was only one stage."
26:41;26:43;"That doesn't surprise me."
26:43;26:44;"It doesn't surprise me."
26:44;26:45;"It just disappointed me."
26:45;26:46;"No, I mean --"
26:46;26:47;"I just thought there would be, like --"
26:47;26:49;"That's an incredible concept."
26:49;26:51;"Just, like, the folk tent."
26:51;26:52;"Right."
26:52;26:55;"Yeah, like a Joan Baez set at, like, 3 in the afternoon."
26:55;26:58;"Yeah, Joan Baez, Donovan's coming through."
26:58;26:59;"Ooh."
26:59;27:03;"Imagine Donovan and Bob Dylan, like, they infamously had this kind of"
27:03;27:05;"awkward interaction in the '60s."
27:05;27:06;"Right, of course."
27:06;27:08;"Because Bob Dylan was being a bit of a Paul McCartney to him."
27:08;27:10;"Way more brutal."
27:10;27:11;"Queerly looking down on him."
27:11;27:12;"Yeah."
27:12;27:14;"And then they see each other, they're like old men now,"
27:14;27:15;"and just kind of like --"
27:15;27:18;"maybe Donovan, like, would stand up for himself more now."
27:18;27:22;"But if Bob's playing the big stage and Donovan's playing the tent, I mean,"
27:22;27:26;"those dynamics are reinforced yet again."
27:26;27:32;"Man, imagine Donovan hearing the news about the Bob Dylan Nobel Prize."
27:32;27:33;"Should we talk about that for a second?"
27:33;27:34;"Sure, yeah."
27:34;27:37;"Okay, this episode is fully old dudes --"
27:37;27:38;"Classic rock, dude."
27:38;27:40;"Old dudes and snack foods."
27:40;27:41;"My wheelhouse, bro."
27:41;27:43;"This is your wheelhouse."
27:43;27:46;"I was about to apologize to the younger listeners, but actually,"
27:46;27:50;"that would be condescending because they know about this stuff."
27:50;27:51;"Yeah, they're in."
27:51;27:54;"You have information at your fingertips, man, Internet era."
27:54;27:56;"Digital natives."
27:56;27:58;"So what's your take on the Dylan Nobel?"
27:58;28:02;"Okay, so anybody who doesn't know, a couple weeks ago,"
28:02;28:08;"Bob Dylan was named the recipient of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature."
28:08;28:10;"And for people not familiar with Bob Dylan's work,"
28:10;28:16;"he has written a couple books, primarily known as a singer, songwriter."
28:16;28:17;"Yeah, songwriter."
28:17;28:20;"And some people got straight up mad about it."
28:20;28:23;"There were op-eds in both Pitchfork and the New York Times being like,"
28:23;28:26;"""Bob Dylan should not have won this prize."""
28:26;28:31;"And generally, from the hater camp, the argument was not that Bob Dylan sucks."
28:31;28:35;"I mean, I saw a few funny people saying Bob Dylan sucked on Twitter,"
28:35;28:36;"to each their own."
28:36;28:40;"But a lot of people were kind of saying, ""Bob Dylan is a legendary musician."
28:40;28:45;"However, this prize should have gone to a novelist or a poet,"
28:45;28:49;"somebody who only works in the written word."""
28:49;28:52;"And then other people were like, ""Man, no, this is cool."""
28:52;28:54;"So first, what's Jake's take?"
28:54;28:56;"I'm a huge Dylan fan."
28:56;28:57;"Yeah."
28:57;28:58;"Huge."
28:58;28:59;"But it made no sense to me."
28:59;29:02;"You're always coming with the surprisingly pragmatic take."
29:02;29:04;"Just like you were very early to be like,"
29:04;29:06;"""You know what, Bernie supporters?"
29:06;29:09;"The dream is dead. Vote for Hillary."""
29:09;29:11;"Well, right on."
29:11;29:14;"With Bob, okay."
29:14;29:15;"A couple things."
29:15;29:20;"First of all, the Nobel Prize, it should go to a novelist or a poet"
29:20;29:23;"who has devoted their lives to that art form"
29:23;29:27;"and maybe are lacking in recognition,"
29:27;29:31;"and that the prize and the money with the prize, it's a million dollars,"
29:31;29:34;"would significantly affect and help their career and their life."
29:34;29:35;"I'm with you, man."
29:35;29:39;"Secondly, it seemed--I saw this on Twitter somewhere."
29:39;29:44;"The Nobel Prize needs Bob Dylan more than Bob Dylan needs the Nobel Prize."
29:44;29:48;"And it sort of reminded me of Obama getting the Peace Prize,"
29:48;29:51;"which was also a little bit like--are the Nobel--"
29:51;29:52;"Kind of undeserved."
29:52;29:57;"Is the Nobel Committee sort of capitulating to celebrity culture?"
29:57;29:59;"It seemed a little bit like--"
29:59;30:01;"That's a very Republican thing to say, man."
30:01;30:03;"Remember when McCain was running against Obama,"
30:03;30:07;"they were like, ""Do you want to elect a politician or a celebrity?"""
30:07;30:09;"They kept being like, ""Obama's just a celebrity."""
30:09;30:11;"Oh, McCain said that in '08?"
30:11;30:15;"They did ads that were kind of like, ""You guys just like Obama because he's a celebrity."""
30:15;30:20;"Well, there's a difference between electing a president and then giving someone an award."
30:20;30:24;"First of all, I want to go point by point through your argument because I strong disagree."
30:24;30:25;"Oh, nice."
30:25;30:28;"Okay, so you're saying that they should give the Nobel Prize"
30:28;30:32;"to somebody whose life would be significantly impacted by it."
30:32;30:33;"That's what you said, man."
30:33;30:35;"It doesn't have to be that."
30:35;30:36;"Okay, so I'm just saying--"
30:36;30:38;"You could give it to a famous novelist who's rich."
30:38;30:39;"You could do that."
30:39;30:42;"But by that logic, it'd be like,"
30:42;30:47;"""You know what, man? Did Einstein really need the Nobel Prize for physics?"
30:47;30:52;"My buddy got a C- in AP Physics. He's just barely scraping by, man."""
30:52;30:55;"Honestly, this would be a huge confidence boost for him."
30:55;30:56;"He could use the money."
30:56;30:58;"You're completely twisting the point."
30:58;31:02;"Albert Einstein is already rich. He's a professor at Princeton."
31:02;31:03;"Let me move on to a third point."
31:03;31:04;"Yeah."
31:04;31:07;"Is that Bob Dylan is an incredible songwriter."
31:07;31:13;"And to separate his lyrics from his singing and from his songwriting"
31:13;31:16;"does a disservice to the songs that he wrote."
31:16;31:22;"So I have marginal interest in reading his lyrics just on a page"
31:22;31:24;"as if it were literature."
31:24;31:25;"That's like a classic--"
31:25;31:26;"That does not interest me."
31:26;31:28;"That's a classic old guy coffee table book."
31:28;31:33;"It's just like a beautiful edition of Dylan's lyrics on the coffee table."
31:33;31:35;"Photographs of him in '64."
31:35;31:42;"They say every man must need protection"
31:42;31:49;"They say every man must fall"
31:49;31:56;"Yet I swear I see my reflection"
31:56;32:03;"Someplace so high above the wall"
32:03;32:10;"I see my light come shining"
32:10;32:17;"From the west down to the east"
32:17;32:23;"Any day now, any day now"
32:23;32:28;"I shall be released"
32:28;32:50;"[harmonica solo]"
32:50;32:55;"Beats one. Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
32:55;32:56;"All right, well, can I give you my take?"
32:56;32:57;"Yeah, yeah. Get in there."
32:57;33:00;"When I heard the news on the radio, I pulled over."
33:00;33:02;"I was on the 101."
33:02;33:05;"It was really difficult to get over to the shoulder."
33:05;33:07;"But I knew I couldn't drive."
33:07;33:09;"I knew I had to process this information first."
33:09;33:11;"And at first, I was with you."
33:11;33:13;"I was like, I love Bob Dylan."
33:13;33:17;"He's won all sorts of Grammys, probably a Kennedy Center's--"
33:17;33:18;"Presidential--"
33:18;33:19;"Presidential Medal of--"
33:19;33:20;"Medal of-- whatever."
33:20;33:21;"Yeah, whatever."
33:21;33:24;"He's sitting on all sorts of awards."
33:24;33:25;"Yeah."
33:25;33:28;"So my first thought was, you know what, man?"
33:28;33:34;"Give the Nobel Prize in Literature to, like, someone who worked in poetry or fiction."
33:34;33:37;"Give Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize for music."
33:37;33:39;"[imitates car horn]"
33:39;33:41;"Yeah, so then I composed myself."
33:41;33:43;"I started driving again."
33:43;33:47;"But I go home rather than the place I was going."
33:47;33:51;"And I sit down in front of my desktop computer."
33:51;33:52;"And I look up."
33:52;33:55;"I wanted to see, like, who usually wins the Nobel Prize for music."
33:55;33:57;"And you know where I'm heading with this, Jake."
33:57;33:58;"Yeah, I do."
33:58;34:00;"Doesn't exist, man."
34:00;34:02;"Oh, I thought Eddie Van Halen won it last year."
34:02;34:04;"[laughter]"
34:04;34:07;"Searing, original, virtuosic guitar work."
34:07;34:10;"For the solo on ""Beat It."""
34:10;34:11;"Yeah."
34:11;34:12;"Eddie Van Halen."
34:12;34:14;"Well, you don't win it for--"
34:14;34:15;"Oh, I guess you do win it for--"
34:15;34:18;"So anyway, there's only a handful of Nobel Prizes, man."
34:18;34:19;"Yeah."
34:19;34:26;"There's physics, economics, peace, maybe a couple other ones, and literature."
34:26;34:27;"I think that's it, actually."
34:27;34:29;"Okay, so maybe there's four."
34:29;34:34;"So literature is the only Nobel Prize that even remotely deals with art."
34:34;34:37;"And I'm not trying to say that physics and economics are not art,"
34:37;34:40;"but I'm speaking in a very traditional sense."
34:40;34:44;"So the only one that has anything to do with art is the Nobel Prize for literature."
34:44;34:46;"And, of course, there's the Grammys."
34:46;34:47;"But you know what else, man?"
34:47;34:49;"There's the Man Booker Prize for books."
34:49;34:50;"There's the Pulitzer Prize."
34:50;34:52;"Sure, sure, sure, I get it."
34:52;35:00;"So it doesn't shock me that the Nobel Prize would say we only have one category"
35:00;35:03;"that remotely deals with art or the written word,"
35:03;35:07;"and that they might say we don't have to give it to a novelist every year."
35:07;35:12;"We want our committee to kind of look at anybody who's contributed to the written word,"
35:12;35:15;"to the way people put together blah, blah, blah."
35:15;35:17;"And when I thought about it that way, then I was like, you know what, man?"
35:17;35:19;"This is fine."
35:19;35:22;"I mean, I think people are just kind of fed up with Bob Dylan just because, you know,"
35:22;35:24;"he's been winning for so long."
35:24;35:26;"And people are burned out on, like, Boomer rock stars."
35:26;35:28;"Yeah, people are burned out on Boomer rock stars."
35:28;35:32;"But, like, I'm trying to think, like, you know,"
35:32;35:36;"if, like, they gave the Nobel Prize in literature to Kanye, I would support that."
35:36;35:38;"Of course, you would have just, like--"
35:38;35:40;"Maybe in 30 years."
35:40;35:43;"Okay, but, yeah, so in 30 years if they gave it to Kanye,"
35:43;35:47;"of course I'm sure you'd also get op-eds saying why he doesn't deserve it."
35:47;35:50;"It'd just be kind of a demographic shift about who liked it and who didn't like it."
35:50;35:54;"But on some basic level, as a musician, songwriter, lyricist,"
35:54;36:04;"I'm not mad that they would look to music as yet another form of artistic word composition."
36:04;36:07;"And I'm trying to think if there's anything outside of that."
36:07;36:11;"If one day they gave the Nobel Prize in literature to someone who only did nonfiction,"
36:11;36:14;"if one day they gave it to a blogger, I'd be with that."
36:14;36:15;"Sure."
36:15;36:20;"I like that they're expanding the definition, and maybe they went with Bob Dylan as part of that."
36:20;36:22;"So, I don't know. I just don't buy the argument that's like,"
36:22;36:25;"he should win a Grammy, not a Nobel Prize."
36:25;36:29;"Because the Nobel Prize is like this idiosyncratic, small, Swedish thing."
36:29;36:30;"Like, don't get it twisted."
36:30;36:34;"I mean, I know, it's tough out there because people are buying less and less books."
36:34;36:40;"But just to put a button on this, Seinfeld 2000 just showed me an article that says,"
36:40;36:44;"""The Nobel Academy says they can't find Bob Dylan to give him his prize."""
36:44;36:50;"That's like when he won the Presidential Medal of Freedom, or the Freedom Medal, or whatever it's called."
36:50;36:53;"Obama was like, ""That's what I want out of Bob Dylan."
36:53;37:02;"I don't want Bob Dylan showing up here and being, like, ingratiating himself and being all wowed by the proceedings."""
37:02;37:06;"He's like, ""I want Bob Dylan to be, like, kind of caging and skeptical of the whole thing."""
37:06;37:08;"Sounds like Obama's a fan."
37:08;37:09;"Yeah."
37:09;37:15;"Okay, Jake, there's one more detail that maybe weakens my argument a little bit that Seinfeld 2000 is showing me."
37:15;37:20;"Because I was kind of thinking, ""Well, what does the Nobel Committee have to give Bob Dylan? Like, a ribbon?"""
37:20;37:21;"A million dollars."
37:21;37:23;"Yeah, I didn't realize that. He basically gets a million dollars."
37:23;37:26;"$927,740."
37:26;37:27;"Mm-hmm."
37:27;37:28;"Okay."
37:28;37:37;"Now, when you put a cash prize on it, I guess I do question why you need to give cash money to a rich person."
37:37;37:38;"Yeah."
37:38;37:43;"And I would say that if Bob Dylan doesn't donate it, that's not a strong look."
37:43;37:44;"Yeah."
37:44;37:49;"If Bob Dylan donates the money, he's got it. You've got to do it, Bob."
37:49;38:00;"But if Bob Dylan donates the money to a good charity, that's cooler than a tenured poetry professor getting it, I guess."
38:00;38:01;"Or it's equal."
38:01;38:02;"No, it's not."
38:02;38:03;"It's not."
38:03;38:04;"None of it's cool."
38:04;38:06;"Let's listen to some Dylan."
38:06;38:08;"What's a good one? ""Blown in the Wind""?"
38:08;38:13;"I was going to say ""Goin' Goin' Gone"" off 1974's ""Planet Waves."""
38:13;38:15;"Oh, my God. That's deep."
38:15;38:20;"""Goin' Goin' Gone."""
38:20;38:21;"I love that song."
38:21;38:24;"All right, I'm not familiar. This was like a critically reviled album."
38:24;38:26;"Really? Throw it on. It's like my favorite Dylan record."
38:26;38:27;"All right, let's check it out."
38:27;38:28;"""Planet Waves."""
38:28;38:31;"Here's Bob Dylan, Nobel Prize winner for literature."
38:31;38:34;"In one of his least literate songs."
38:34;38:38;"In one of his least literate songs. ""Goin' Goin' Gone."""
38:38;38:46;"I just reached a place where the willow don't bend."
38:46;38:49;"There's not much more to be said."
38:49;38:53;"It's the top of the end."
38:53;38:58;"I'm going."
38:58;39:01;"I'm going."
39:01;39:10;"I'm going."
39:10;39:14;"I'm closing the book"
39:14;39:18;"On the pages and the tape"
39:18;39:21;"And I don't really care"
39:21;39:25;"Oh, what happened there"
39:25;39:29;"I'm just going"
39:29;39:33;"I'm going"
39:37;39:46;"I've been hanging on the threads"
39:46;39:50;"I've been playing it straight"
39:50;39:54;"Now I've just got to cut loose"
39:54;39:58;"Before it gets me"
39:58;40:02;"So I'm going"
40:02;40:06;"I'm going"
40:06;40:09;"I'm going"
40:09;40:17;"I almost said boy"
40:17;40:21;"Go and follow your heart"
40:21;40:26;"And you'll be fine at the end of the line"
40:26;40:30;"And all that's gone doesn't shine"
40:30;40:33;"On you and your one true love"
40:33;40:38;"Never part"
40:38;40:42;"I've been walking alone"
40:42;40:46;"I've been living on the edge"
40:46;40:49;"I've just got to go"
40:49;40:52;"Before I get to the ledge"
40:52;40:56;"So I'm going"
40:56;41:00;"I'm just going"
41:00;41:03;"I'm going"
41:24;41:29;"That was Bob Dylan with Goin' Goin' Gone. I'm gonna have my second handful of"
41:29;41:34;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Planet waves kids. From Planet Waves. That's the album, 74."
41:34;41:39;"By the way, I think we should make it clear, because a lot of people, because we"
41:39;41:42;"talk about a lot of Frito-Lay's products, people sometimes think we're sponsored"
41:42;41:51;"by them. We are. No, we're not. It's actually a merger between Apple and Frito-Lay."
41:51;41:58;"Apple has recently acquired Frito-Lay. No, look, we got no love for Frito-Lay."
41:58;42:04;"Well, we have like an ambivalent, skeptical, semi-ironic interest in Frito-Lay."
42:04;42:08;"I love Richard Montanez, the former janitor who invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos,"
42:08;42:16;"but everybody else up at Frito-Lay, I got no respect for. Wow. And I want everybody"
42:16;42:19;"to know, wrong words, that even though I'm eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos here, I'm"
42:19;42:27;"being completely honest. In my home, in my office. Alright, I was just informed we"
42:27;42:31;"might have somebody from Frito-Lay come on the show, maybe in the next episode,"
42:31;42:35;"but I'm being honest. I don't have any Frito-Lay products in my home or office,"
42:35;42:38;"but we'll, you know, we'll respect that person as a human being. Well, if that"
42:38;42:42;"person is an executive, they probably don't have Frito-Lay products either."
42:42;42:46;"Right, we learned that last time. Michael Moss informed us of that. And also, we've"
42:46;42:50;"just been informed by Seinfeld 2000, there is a level up from Flamin' Hot"
42:50;42:56;"Cheetos that's called Cheetos Crunchy Cheddar Jalapeno Cheese Flavored Snacks."
42:56;43:01;"So, well, maybe we'll have to try those next time. That's a concise title."
43:01;43:06;"We are not endorsing anything in the Cheetos family. That was like nine words"
43:06;43:10;"in that title. Nothing wrong with that, man. If anything, they should hire us for Cheetos."
43:10;43:13;"It's like a transformer or something."
43:13;43:20;"So, we were talking earlier, before the show, about who else they could have"
43:20;43:25;"possibly gotten for Old Chella, and one name that came up was the boss himself,"
43:25;43:29;"Bruce Springsteen. Right. And we both kind of decided Bruce is a generation"
43:29;43:33;"removed from the Stones and Dylan, so it doesn't surprise us, but, you know, it"
43:33;43:40;"would have made sense. Yeah. But we both have been reading Bruce's memoirs, which"
43:40;43:43;"came out recently. Yeah. My voice is starting to sound weird because of the"
43:43;43:48;"Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Acid reflux? Having a very negative reaction in my throat."
43:48;43:53;"Some Frito-Lay executives listening to this right now just driving their car"
43:53;43:59;"into a wall. Yeah. I feel quite ill. So, we're gonna talk about Bruce a little bit."
43:59;44:07;"Got a new book in stores now. It's called Born to Run. Hmm. That's one of his songs"
44:07;44:13;"and albums. What else is he gonna call it? It makes perfect sense. So, I"
44:13;44:18;"finished the book. You're still... I'm only 80 pages in. Okay, so we're gonna talk a"
44:18;44:22;"little bit about our first impressions of the book, and then we're gonna skip"
44:22;44:25;"ahead because there's a specific Bruce song I'd like to talk about. Okay. So,"
44:25;44:29;"first of all, I'm a pretty big Bruce fan. Yeah. I grew up in New Jersey, after all,"
44:29;44:34;"where he's a very important artist. I already knew a lot about him. Yeah."
44:34;44:37;"Followed his career, but it was interesting for me the first few"
44:37;44:43;"chapters, he talks a lot about his family of origin, talks about growing up in"
44:43;44:47;"Freehold, New Jersey, and that's always my favorite part of any book. Like, the"
44:47;44:52;"Morrissey book, the first hundred pages. Interesting. Him describing growing up in"
44:52;44:59;"Manchester. ""Growing up, growing up."" I just like... It's so good, like Morrissey talking"
44:59;45:04;"about, like, taking the bus in the rain to Johnny Marr's house. You know, like, three"
45:04;45:08;"bus transfers through, like, grey Manchester. It's, like, so depressing. He"
45:08;45:12;"talks about his school, which was like a Victorian relic that was really cold. I"
45:12;45:15;"think you're just picturing, like, little boy Morrissey in, like, this freezing"
45:15;45:19;"Victorian school. In, like, the 70s. Yeah, just getting, like, his, like, knuckles, like,"
45:19;45:24;"smacked by, like, a teacher. So anyway, I like hearing about people's origins"
45:24;45:29;"because I'm often very familiar with, like, the career part. So, one thing that I"
45:29;45:36;"found interesting about Bruce is Springsteen is a weird name. Yeah. Like,"
45:36;45:41;"let's keep it real. And, you know, also in the Jewish community, people would often"
45:41;45:44;"be like, ""Is Bruce Springsteen Jewish?"" Because it almost sounds like when Jewish"
45:44;45:48;"people try to change their name a little bit. Like Springstein. Springstein. Right."
45:48;45:52;"Like, maybe change to Springsteen. Not Jewish. Like Dutch and Welsh or something?"
45:52;45:56;"It's a Dutch name, but he doesn't identify with his Dutch heritage"
45:56;46:02;"whatsoever. Because whoever had that last name, Springsteen, was so, so far back in"
46:02;46:05;"the family tree. And it's always funny how that happens. We've talked on the"
46:05;46:10;"show about Robert De Niro. One-quarter Italian. Right. But he has an Italian last"
46:10;46:15;"name. So, you know, that people assume that he's very Italian. Not to mention his"
46:15;46:20;"film career. But, so, Springsteen, that's some dude, some Dutch guy way, way back."
46:20;46:25;"And Bruce makes it clear that that side of his family was Irish. And the other"
46:25;46:29;"side of his family was Italian. And, you know, for me growing up in New Jersey,"
46:29;46:35;"Irish-Italian is the most classic combo. Yeah. There's no way to verify this, but"
46:35;46:40;"at least within people of European descent intermarrying, I'm pretty sure"
46:40;46:46;"that Irish-Italian is the most common ethnic mixture. I believe that. In America."
46:46;46:50;"Well, especially that region. North Jersey. Oh, yeah. I think the armchair"
46:50;46:57;"sociologist's reasoning would be that they went to church together. Right, right."
46:57;47:00;"So, Irish-Italian, very common mixtures. It's very near and dear to my heart."
47:00;47:04;"Thinking about the last name thing. How, like, you know, Springsteen, it's such like"
47:04;47:11;"an interesting name. So, his mom's family, the Italian side, his grandfather was"
47:11;47:17;"born in Italy and got into some trouble, did some time in jail. He has a chapter"
47:17;47:20;"in the book called ""The Italians."" There's a chapter called ""The Irish and the Italians."""
47:20;47:29;"Yeah, I read those. He also... Jesus. Flamin' Hots."
47:29;47:36;"Killing me, man. No more Flamin' Hots for me. So, his mom's family's last name was"
47:36;47:44;"Zerilli. I might be mispronouncing it. It might be Zerilli. Z-E-R-I-L-L-I. Okay, yeah, Zerilli."
47:44;47:49;"Beautiful Italian name. I'm just thinking, with all of us, it's luck of the draw"
47:49;47:55;"what our last name, you know, we live in this patriarchal... live in this patriarchal"
47:55;48:04;"society. Take a swig of water, man. I'm a one handful of Flamin' Hot Cheetos guy. That's where I'm at"
48:04;48:09;"right now. And will remain. So, you know, we live in a patriarchal... that's just a"
48:09;48:14;"hard word to say, actually. Patriarchal? Wait. I thought it's patriarchal. We live"
48:14;48:20;"in a patriarchal... You know what, man? We live in a patriarchy where nine times out"
48:20;48:27;"of ten, you take the dad's name, right? Bruce's dad. Right, you took your dad's"
48:27;48:32;"name. Yeah. You didn't have any choice in the matter. Neither did I. My mom's last"
48:32;48:39;"name is Bass. Ezra Bass. Don't love it. What would your last name have been if"
48:39;48:46;"we lived in a matriarchy? Connect. Connect? Yeah, German. K-N-E-C-H-T. Like"
48:46;48:51;"Connect Auto Parts? No relation to the Connect Auto Parts chain, but same name."
48:51;48:55;"That's so weird that it just sounds like connect. Yeah, it sounds like the word"
48:55;49:04;"connect. But it's... That sounds kind of like a gangster, Jake Connect. Hey, man, if I"
49:04;49:07;"want to get a little, uh, some of that stuff, who would I talk to? Oh, you don't"
49:07;49:13;"want to talk to me. You want to talk to Jake Connect. Jacob Connect. What's his last"
49:13;49:18;"name? Connect. Connect. I know he's the Connect, but you know, what's his full"
49:18;49:24;"name? Oh, you don't want to tell me his full name. I see. Jake Connect. Ezra Bass"
49:24;49:29;"and Jake Connect. Those both sound weird, man."
49:47;49:52;"I heard you good with them soft lips. Yeah, you know word of mouth. The square"
49:52;50:01;"root of 69 is 8-something, right? 'Cause I been trying to work it out. I'll goot white wine, uh. I come alive in the"
50:01;50:22;"nighttime, yeah. Okay, away we go. Only thing we ever on is the radio. Let it play. Say you got a lead, but I know you want to stay. You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl. The things that we can do in 20 minutes, girl. Say my name, say my name. Wear it out. It's getting hot, crack a window. Air it out. I can get you through a mighty long night."
50:22;50:34;"Soon as you go, the text that I write is gonna say. Oh, na-na, what's my name? Oh, na-na, what's my name? Oh, na-na, what's my name? What's my name? What's my name?"
50:34;50:53;"Everybody knows how to work my body. Knows how to make me want it. But boy, you stay up on it. You got the something that keeps me so balanced. Baby, you're a challenge. Let's explore your talent."
50:53;51:12;"Hey boy, I really wanna see if you can go long time with a girl like me. Hey boy, I really wanna be with you. Is it just my type? Oh, na-na-na-na. I need a boy to take it over. Looking for a guy to put it over. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh."
51:31;51:34;"Welcome to Time Crisis with Ezra Bass and Jake Connect."
51:34;51:36;"Hi, I'm Ezra Bass."
51:36;51:38;"I'm Jake Connect."
51:38;51:42;"So we'll be talking about Bruce periodically over the next couple months, dipping in and out of the book."
51:42;51:46;"I'm psyched to read the whole book. I'm gonna spend like a weekend and just plow through it."
51:46;51:47;"It's a great book."
51:47;51:49;"Actually, I'm flying somewhere this weekend, so I'm gonna take the book."
51:49;51:50;"Oh, perfect. Perfect for the plan."
51:50;51:53;"To and fro and just crush that book on the plane."
51:53;52:01;"Now, because this show's about music and we don't play enough music always, I wanna just focus in on one Bruce song."
52:01;52:02;"Okay."
52:02;52:07;"So we're talking about Bruce's early life, growing up a young Irish-Italian-American in New Jersey."
52:07;52:10;"But let's skip ahead to the '90s."
52:10;52:14;"Bruce is in his 40s, already went through his superstar era."
52:14;52:15;"Totally."
52:15;52:20;"And he made a song that I've been listening to a lot recently 'cause I really associate it with being a kid."
52:20;52:22;"The song is ""Streets of Philadelphia."""
52:22;52:23;"It's a beautiful song."
52:23;52:27;"It was also interesting. He's a guy who's reinvented himself many times."
52:27;52:35;"A lot of people remember, maybe some people don't, there was a big movie in 1994 called ""Philadelphia"" starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington."
52:35;52:37;"Directed by Jonathan Demme."
52:37;52:38;"Directed by Jonathan Demme."
52:38;52:45;"Kind of at the height of the AIDS crisis, Tom Hanks is a closeted gay lawyer working at a very conservative firm."
52:45;52:52;"I haven't seen it in a long time, but I remember it's like there's these kind of conservative, homophobic old lawyers."
52:52;52:53;"Mm-hmm."
52:53;52:56;"And he doesn't feel comfortable being out."
52:56;52:57;"Yeah."
52:57;52:58;"But then he gets AIDS."
52:58;52:59;"Yeah."
52:59;53:05;"And he can't hide the lesions, and at that time AIDS was demonized."
53:05;53:08;"I mean, it still is in many places."
53:08;53:09;"And they fire him."
53:09;53:10;"Yeah."
53:10;53:12;"So now he's, this guy's suffering, dying from a disease."
53:12;53:15;"No job, no benefits, whatever."
53:15;53:18;"And he wants to sue his blue chip law firm."
53:18;53:24;"And the only lawyer who would take the case is Denzel, who I think they make a point is kind of--"
53:24;53:25;"Slightly homophobic."
53:25;53:27;"Slightly homophobic, but also like--"
53:27;53:28;"Or not slightly."
53:28;53:33;"But also an outsider too as a black man working not at a blue chip Philadelphia law firm."
53:33;53:37;"Anybody in the room who's seen the movie agree with my synopsis so far?"
53:37;53:40;"I've seen it within the last five years, and I agree."
53:40;53:44;"So Bruce writes a song for it called ""Streets of Philadelphia."""
53:44;53:46;"And first of all--"
53:46;53:47;"Start it. I want to hear it."
53:47;53:50;"[drums]"
53:50;53:52;"So this is Bruce's first hip-hop song, by the way."
53:52;53:54;"He programmed these drums."
53:54;53:55;"Oh, really?"
53:55;54:01;"Yeah, he says in the book, ""I was playing around on my drum machine, did a kind of hip-hop beat."""
54:01;54:02;"Maybe it's more trip-hop."
54:02;54:05;"It's kind of crazy how long the beat goes."
54:05;54:09;"Just in case you want to freestyle over the beginning."
54:09;54:10;"I remember like--"
54:10;54:11;"Oh, listen to that vibey synth."
54:11;54:12;"It's so good."
54:12;54:15;"No guitars."
54:15;54:20;"I remember when this came out, I guess I was probably 16 or something."
54:20;54:23;"So I was pretty familiar with Bruce's reputation and his work."
54:23;54:28;"I remember the drum machine was so jarring and weirdly lo-fi."
54:28;54:29;"Yeah."
54:29;54:34;"♪ I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt ♪"
54:34;54:37;"I remember not liking this in '93."
54:37;54:38;"Oh, really?"
54:38;54:40;"I couldn't hang with it in '93."
54:40;54:42;"But I've since gotten very into it."
54:42;54:45;"♪ Know my own face, oh brother ♪"
54:45;54:50;"♪ Gonna leave me wasting away in the streets of Philadelphia ♪"
54:50;54:55;"♪ Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na ♪"
54:55;54:57;"Such a great vocal performance from Bruce on this."
54:57;54:58;"Yeah."
54:58;55:02;"This one and then ""Secret Garden"" from Jerry McGruder's soundtrack."
55:02;55:05;"Interesting sort of sonic palette he was working with at that time."
55:05;55:07;"That's that '90s Bruce."
55:07;55:11;"Did he make an album of like synth?"
55:11;55:12;"He didn't."
55:12;55:13;"No."
55:13;55:16;"Because he did ""Keep in Touch"" in '92 and he did ""Tom Joe"" in '95."
55:16;55:18;"I wish he had done an album just like--"
55:18;55:23;"I think there might be an album he never released that's in this mode. yeah."
55:37;55:55;"wow."
55:55;55:57;"this man knows how to ride a bridge."
55:57;56:02;"he really does. he might be the greatest bridge rider of all time."
56:37;56:40;"so you get the idea."
56:40;56:42;"everybody should go listen to that song."
56:42;56:45;"not on a radio show so you can just enjoy it."
56:45;56:49;"but one thing i find very moving about this song"
56:49;56:53;"is also like just to go back to 1993."
56:53;56:58;"yeah. it's like incredible the opposition there was to helping people with AIDS."
56:58;57:05;"people saying the craziest stuff. yeah. the Reagans especially had a shameful history of how they dealt with the epidemic."
57:05;57:07;"so also just to think about back then."
57:07;57:13;"Bruce Springsteen he was known as the voice of the working class American. right."
57:13;57:16;"and he was you know especially born in the USA era."
57:16;57:20;"he was this kind of like jacked all American dude."
57:20;57:26;"kind of like an icon of a certain type of like heterosexual American maleness. right."
57:26;57:33;"and you could misconstrue that for like a John Wayne sort of boneheaded patriotism."
57:33;57:38;"as famously Ronald Reagan shouted him out in the born in the USA era."
57:38;57:43;"even though that song was a critique of the way that you know working class people have been treated in this country."
57:43;57:47;"maybe today so much has shifted it wouldn't be as meaningful."
57:47;57:52;"but to picture this guy this icon of like working class kind of heterosexual masculinity."
57:52;57:59;"writing a song for a movie that was about a gay man being totally brutalized."
57:59;58:07;"and dying. and dying by this disease and being mistreated by this homophobic rich people."
58:07;58:13;"that Bruce would put the same eye that was kind of like known for talking about the dude whose factory closed down."
58:13;58:17;"and that he would then be singing about an abused gay man dying of AIDS."
58:17;58:19;"that was like very meaningful."
58:19;58:21;"and you know. yeah it's interesting."
58:21;58:25;"and you also think about like you know like it would be pretty lame if Bruce only cared about."
58:25;58:29;"blue collar guys in Jersey. blue collar guys in Jersey whose factory closed down."
58:29;58:31;"he's a progressive to the bone."
58:31;58:36;"just like a good politician he cares about all people who are oppressed by the horrendous system."
58:36;58:39;"I just find the lines in it so moving like."
58:39;58:42;"saw my reflection in a window didn't know my own face."
58:42;58:45;"talking about a guy dying from a disease it's awful."
58:45;58:47;"he's probably lost weight."
58:47;58:49;"yeah as it happens in the movie."
58:49;58:52;"yeah interesting that Neil Young also did a song for the movie."
58:52;58:55;"right so Neil Young also did a song for Philadelphia."
58:55;58:56;"called Philadelphia. called Philadelphia."
58:56;58:58;"but it really got lost in the shuffle."
58:58;59:00;"cause streets of Philadelphia was like a big hit."
59:00;59:06;"it's interesting to think about him having maybe the same internal debate that Bruce might have had in 93."
59:06;59:12;"of like oh do I want to attach my name to this really progressive cause."
59:12;59:13;"yes I do."
59:13;59:14;"right."
59:14;59:18;"something about Neil and Bruce both writing songs for that movie like makes sense."
59:18;59:20;"they're like the progressive guys."
59:20;59:21;"yeah. that mode."
59:21;59:22;"yeah."
59:22;59:24;"Ted Nugent is the other side of the spectrum."
59:24;59:26;"I'm sure Ted Nugent was not getting a call."
59:26;59:28;"Nugent's phone wasn't ringing."
59:28;59:32;"yeah. so one thing I found interesting about that song is there's a really iconic video."
59:32;59:35;"which I encourage everybody to watch if you haven't seen it."
59:35;59:40;"for those who remember it's like this video of kind of just like early Bruce probably 43, 44."
59:40;59:41;"goatee."
59:42;59:44;"this kind of 90's Bruce look."
59:44;59:47;"kind of slightly messy hair wearing like just a leather jacket."
59:47;59:51;"looking like a very normal dude walking the streets of Philadelphia."
59:51;59:52;"like a chain link fence."
59:52;59:54;"yeah a lot of chain link fence."
59:54;59:55;"like kids playing."
59:55;59:56;"homeless people."
59:56;01:00:01;"just showing like kind of the joy and pain of an American city."
01:00:01;01:00:05;"and because Bruce knew that this was like a very emotional meaningful song."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"he didn't want to lip sync."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"interesting."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"99% of videos you lip sync."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"right."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"because otherwise you're not playing the recording of the song."
01:00:15;01:00:18;"you record the vocals in the studio and then you pretend to sing."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"yeah."
01:00:19;01:00:24;"so Bruce insisted on wearing a microphone so that he could actually sing as he's talking."
01:00:24;01:00:30;"so if you listen to the video version you'll notice the vocals sound a little funny."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"and you hear all this ambient noise like his shirt rustling."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"his feet crunching on the ground."
01:00:34;01:00:43;"so it was the integrity of the subject matter that determined."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"yeah he lips."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"yeah dancing in the dark or whatever."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"yeah he's no stranger to lip syncing."
01:00:47;01:00:51;"but he's just like I can't with a straight face lip sync about this heavy issue."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"oh wow yeah."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"like it doesn't have the same reverb."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"yeah."
01:00:58;01:01:17;"pretty good vocal performance."
01:01:17;01:01:21;"do they have like an in-ear or are they just playing like the instrumental track as he walked I wonder."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"I would love to know that."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"if anybody worked on the streets of Philadelphia music video."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"send us an email."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"that's cool man."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I love that."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"listen to all that noise."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"yeah the rustling."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"I like how it's so not finicky."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"yeah."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"he's like yeah it might be a little bit raw but it'll."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"yeah."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"that's so cool."
01:01:47;01:01:54;"we need to listen to the whole thing but kind of the end of the story is that Bruce won an Academy Award for it."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"what best song in a movie is that."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"I believe it's the best original song."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"okay."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"for a film."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"you know best song in a movie."
01:02:01;01:02:07;"and the winner for best song in a movie man."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"it's Bruce man."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"Bruce."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"the boss."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Bruce."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"so."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"like Sean Pan like."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"so actually the person who presented."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"I have the audio."
01:02:19;01:02:20;"you have it."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"okay let's do it."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"ladies and gentlemen Whitney Houston."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"so Whitney Houston presented the award."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"this is the 94 Oscars."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"Whitney just in her prime."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"yeah."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"wearing a gorgeous white pantsuit."
01:02:35;01:02:41;"during the course of the evening you have heard the five songs nominated for original song."
01:02:41;01:02:45;"to refresh your memories I offer to sing them all again."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"good joke."
01:02:47;01:02:53;"but they said just read the names."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"so the nominees for original song are."
01:02:56;01:02:59;"from poetic justice again."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"music and lyric by Janet Jackson."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"James Harris the third and Terry Lewis."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"great song."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"remember that one."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"no I don't think I do."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"it was a good one."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"from Beethoven second."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"the day I fell in love."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"music and lyric by Carol Beyer Sager."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"James Ingram and Cliff Magnus."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"Beethoven second yes that's the sequel to the dog movie."
01:03:16;01:03:19;"from Philadelphia music and lyric by Neil Young."
01:03:19;01:03:27;"from Philadelphia streets of Philadelphia music and lyric by Bruce Springsteen."
01:03:27;01:03:30;"starting to get the bigger applause."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"yeah."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"from sleepless in Seattle a wink and a smile."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"music by Mark Shaman lyric by Ramsey McLean."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"not familiar."
01:03:39;01:03:40;"I remember."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"and the Oscar goes to."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"and the winner goes to."
01:03:42;01:03:51;"it goes to Bruce Springsteen for streets of Philadelphia from Philadelphia."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"seemed like she wasn't really feeling that."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"yeah it almost seems like she wanted Neil Young to win."
01:03:55;01:04:02;"Bruce is walking in."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"he's getting a standing ovation."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"yeah see I'm just getting the audio."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"I'm not getting the visual."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"yeah."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"he's got the goatee."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"he's wearing all black."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"suit or what is he wearing?"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"they cut to his wife Patty in the audience."
01:04:12;01:04:16;"it kind of looks like he's wearing black jeans."
01:04:16;01:04:19;"he's wearing a black suit jacket."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"no tie."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"thank you."
01:04:22;01:04:27;"see this is the first song I ever wrote for a motion picture."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"so I guess it's all down."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"really it's the first song?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"yeah man."
01:04:30;01:04:34;"but Neil I got to share this with you."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"is Neil there?"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"yeah."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"they don't cut to him in the audience."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"they don't cut to him at that moment."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"I think he is there."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"you do your best work and you hope that it pulls out the best in your audience."
01:04:47;01:04:53;"and some piece of it spills over into the real world and into people's everyday lives."
01:04:53;01:05:01;"and it takes the edge off the fear and allows us to recognize each other through our veil of differences."
01:05:01;01:05:07;"I always thought that was one of the things popular art was supposed to be about along with the merchandising and all the other stuff."
01:05:07;01:05:13;"but I just want to say thank you Jonathan for having me as a part of your picture."
01:05:13;01:05:19;"glad my song has contributed to its ideas and its acceptance."
01:05:19;01:05:23;"love you Pats and thank you all for inviting me to your party."
01:05:23;01:05:29;"Bruce is a very articulate guy."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"then they cut to Tom Hanks in the audience."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"he's got a look on his face like what a guy."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"yeah."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"just clapping, turning to his wife Rita Wilson."
01:05:38;01:05:43;"I like Bruce getting all philosophical about the role of popular arts."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"yeah that's a good point."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"I mean people don't go there you know."
01:05:46;01:05:50;"the one thing I'll say is and maybe it's because this is 22 years ago."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"I feel like Bruce used somewhat coded language."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"maybe he felt like it wasn't his place to talk about the meaning of the film."
01:05:56;01:06:02;"he said hopefully popular art lets us look past the fear."
01:06:02;01:06:07;"to treat each other like human beings or whatever and see through the veil of difference."
01:06:07;01:06:11;"so clearly he's talking about the fear and the stigma attached to AIDS."
01:06:11;01:06:17;"but I feel like in 2016 we would kind of expect him to say something slightly more explicit."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"about homophobia or..."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"I believe Bruce's heart is very much in the right place."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"yeah."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"that's true."
01:06:25;01:06:33;"in '93 I mean I remember that was the first time that the concept of gay marriage was in the mainstream."
01:06:33;01:06:38;"and I remember like one of my parents was like yeah whatever."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"and one of them was like what?"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"that's weird."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"unfamiliar with the..."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"and then my other parent was like really?"
01:06:44;01:06:48;"like I've been married to you for this long and you're like weirded out by that?"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"that's crazy."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"these are the things people don't discuss before they get married."
01:06:52;01:06:57;"well I remember I was like 15 or 16 and I was sort of like wow interesting to see this like political clash."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"right that's made... see your parents disagreeing about something."
01:07:00;01:07:05;"I mean it was the first time that idea had like come to the mainstream and probably it occurred to them."
01:07:05;01:07:09;"I'd like to imagine that both your parents support now legal gay marriage."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"absolutely."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"in 2016."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"that was 20 something years ago."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"took way too long."
01:07:13;01:07:16;"we had a... as a nation there was a long way to go."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"but anyway."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Bruce Springsteen's Streets of Philadelphia."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"great song."
01:07:20;01:07:23;"also shows that people can make good music into their 40s."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"50s!"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"come on up with the rising."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"oh yeah."
01:07:29;01:07:31;"Bruce always has a good song on every album."
01:07:31;01:07:34;"I got really into that Rising album in '02."
01:07:34;01:07:39;"oh you know what song I love that Bruce included on his last album that I'd like to play?"
01:07:39;01:07:42;"you know Bruce... people have these perceptions of him."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"they don't always know the holistic man and that's why it's cool that he wrote a book."
01:07:45;01:07:51;"but you know Bruce is always very influenced by punk music even though he's very much not associated with punk."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"one of the weirder punk bands that he liked a lot was Suicide."
01:07:55;01:07:56;"yeah that's okay."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"okay."
01:07:57;01:07:58;"of course."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"and you know Suicide with the super minimalist."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"I guess people even call Suicide proto-punk because they were so ahead of their time."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"yeah."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"weird drum machines."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"that like almost reminds me of Philadelphia."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"well totally."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"yeah the aesthetic."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"and he was up on them for a very long time."
01:08:11;01:08:16;"well first of all we got a I think this year we lost Alan Vega, member of Suicide."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"so shout out to him rest in peace."
01:08:18;01:08:21;"but Bruce they were an influence on Nebraska the album."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"influence on a lot of his later work."
01:08:23;01:08:27;"and he would sometimes cover their song Dream Baby Dream in concert."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"and he finally included it on his last studio album."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"oh really?"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"yeah let's listen to it."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"I've heard the live versions."

01:13:05;01:13:10;"As always, I keep it 100% honest with our listeners."
01:13:10;01:13:14;"I have to admit, I have gone back into the Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"I've only had two of them."

01:13:23;01:13:27;"It's pounding Bruce. I'm eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"This is an all-American show."

01:13:30;01:13:33;"Take these Flamin' Hots away from me."
01:13:33;01:13:36;"I can't eat them anymore."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Apologies to our listeners if my voice sounds weird"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"for the rest of the show."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"It's been perhaps irreparably damaged"
01:13:42;01:13:45;"by my third handful of Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"You were like, with that Cheetos riff,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"you were doing Bruce combined with Dylan."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Combined, yeah."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"You were like in the late Bruce voice."
01:13:54;01:13:55;"Yeah."
01:13:55;01:13:59;"Doing a parody of Knock on Heaven's Door about Cheetos."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"I'm just connecting all the dots, man."
01:14:01;01:14:02;"Dude, look at you."
01:14:02;01:14:05;"So, Jake, you've been running a little bit of a mailbag"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"for Time Crisis."
01:14:06;01:14:07;"Yeah."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"We've gotten some great listener emails."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Yeah, we really have."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"Don't have time to get to all of them today."
01:14:12;01:14:16;"We legitimately have a backlog of great listener emails."
01:14:16;01:14:18;"We only have time for one, but this is a good one"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"that we've been meaning to talk about."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"Got this from Matt in Cambridge, Massachusetts,"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"a few weeks ago."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"Great town."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"And he went deep."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"He was just talking about PepsiCo and Billy Joel,"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"and he connected the dots."
01:14:34;01:14:35;"Love it."
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Hey, Jake, like any Time Crisis fan,"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"popular music is almost as important to me"
01:14:39;01:14:43;"as corporate history and matters of finance."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"So, imagine my joy when I found some documents"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"that link one of TC's favorite popular musicians,"
01:14:47;01:14:51;"Billy Joel, with one of TC's favorite corporations, Pepsi."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"There was a show, a syndicated radio show,"
01:14:54;01:14:59;"called Pepsi Hitline USA, that aired on, like, Sunday nights."
01:14:59;01:15:02;"Hitline USA was a nationally syndicated radio show"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"produced by James Paul Brown Entertainment"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"of Culver City, California."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Wow."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"And sponsored by PepsiCo."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"It aired on Sunday evenings, and each episode"
01:15:11;01:15:14;"would feature a superstar of popular music,"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"usually promoting a new album,"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"would answer listener phone calls and chat with the host."
01:15:18;01:15:22;"The show started in 1986 and ran until the mid-'90s."
01:15:22;01:15:25;"Hitline USA was in part a brainchild"
01:15:25;01:15:29;"of a Pepsi marketing executive, Michael K. Lorielli."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"Lorielli was a dynamic marketer whose career was skyrocketed"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"after running a successful media counter-assault"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"on the FDA's claim that Clairol hair products"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"were inducing cancer in rats."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Wait, wait, back up there."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"Yep."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"So, this guy, Michael Lorielli,"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"was working presumably for Clairol,"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"and the FDA came in and was like,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"""Your product is causing cancer,"""
01:15:52;01:15:54;"and he ran a very successful, quote,"
01:15:54;01:15:58;"""media counter-assault,"" according to Forbes, May '94."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Oh, so that's like some Don Draper,"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"you know, fighting back for tobacco."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"Some Karl Rove stuff."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Hitline USA was one of the first projects"
01:16:06;01:16:11;"after leaving Apple and joining PepsiCo."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Oh, I did a little time with old Apple."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"In '86."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"In '86, he joins PepsiCo."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"He would rise through the PepsiCo ranks,"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"spearheading a host of important campaigns,"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"including the placement of Pepsi's first advertisement"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"in a home video, ""Top Gun."""
01:16:24;01:16:27;"Lorielli said he was living, eating, drinking,"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"sleeping, and dreaming the Cola Wars,"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"and was as close to heaven as one might imagine."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"That's a quote from ""Beverage World,"" March '93."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Oh!"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"This is a killer email."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"I just want to point something out."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"We're just getting going."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"This is the height of the Cola Wars, the '80s."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Coke versus Pepsi."
01:16:44;01:16:48;"Pepsi's looking to hire a brash..."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"The minds of their generation."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"They're looking for a wartime consigliere."

01:16:58;01:17:02;"They want a bad boy to come in to help them take down Coke."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"So they're looking around."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"I'm picturing this, having a board meeting."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"We need a killer."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"We need a killer on Pepsi's marketing team."
01:17:10;01:17:11;"We're dying out here."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"Coke's murdering us."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"We need to bounce back."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"Anybody heard about any good guys out there?"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Well, there's a guy making waves at Apple."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"Michael K. Lorelli."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Let me take it back a step further."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"I heard about this guy."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"He's at Apple."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"But before, he was at Clairol."
01:17:25;01:17:30;"Remember when the FDA said that Clairol was causing cancer?"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"He's the guy who made it go away."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"PepsiCo's like, I love it."
01:17:35;01:17:41;"If this guy can make a cancerous product stay on the shelves,"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"if he can shut down the nanny state,"

01:23:29;01:23:32;"Pepsi at least has stayed true to this, you know,"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"being the youthful brand."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"Coke occasionally veers youthful,"
01:23:36;01:23:37;"but Coke's a heritage brand."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Pepsi, even though it's been around for a long time,"
01:23:40;01:23:44;"will always be the second born, the young gun,"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"the up and comer."
01:23:46;01:23:50;"So Pepsi still does more partnerships with superstars."
01:23:50;01:23:54;"They're paying super big bucks to work with the Billy"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Joels of their day."
01:23:55;01:23:56;"So who's the Billy Joel of today?"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Obviously Beyonce."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"Obviously Beyonce."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Wholesome songwriting, American songwriting."
01:24:01;01:24:07;"Both superstars, both arguably the Pele's of their genre,"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"both the Pizza Hut's and all that."
01:24:08;01:24:13;"But so Beyonce, I guess her tour is somehow sponsored by Pepsi."
01:24:13;01:24:16;"Now this is some beef I definitely don't want to get"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"into, but I'd be remiss not to mention it."
01:24:17;01:24:21;"So does that mean like the Pepsi logo is on her stage?"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"I went to a Beyonce show."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"I didn't notice any Pepsi branding."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"But what's the beef?"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I guess Bon Iver was doing some press for his new album."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"That's right."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"And he made a kind of negative statement about Beyonce's"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"ties to Pepsi."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"He said that you're not a good role model if you take"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"a few million dollars from Pepsi."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Right."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"And I'm a fan of both."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Okay, I saw that article too."
01:24:38;01:24:42;"And he actually mentioned that he had done a Bushmills ad."
01:24:42;01:24:43;"And he regretted it."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"And regretted it."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"We've touched on this before on the show."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"The sort of, we're talking about the Shins doing a"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"McDonald's ad like 20 years ago."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"It used to be completely stigmatized if you were like,"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"especially if you were an indie rocker like Bon Iver."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Now it's just the world we live in, man."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"You know, the only person who could actually settle"
01:25:00;01:25:03;"this beef because Bon Iver and Beyonce are both"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"great iconic artists."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"I have admiration for both of them."
01:25:06;01:25:06;"Yeah."
01:25:06;01:25:09;"I am not in a position to settle this beef."
01:25:09;01:25:12;"The only person who could really say who's right,"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"I think is Billy Joel."
01:25:13;01:25:17;"Because he and Bon Iver are both in the Caucasian singer"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"songwriter tradition."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"But Billy and Beyonce have both partnered up with Pepsi"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"to promote their albums."
01:25:23;01:25:26;"So he can kind of see both sides here."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"I guess we don't have any contact info for Billy."
01:25:30;01:25:33;"Man, imagine one day we get Billy on the show."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"I bet Billy would just be like, ""Play ball, dude."""
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I think Billy would definitely take Beyonce's side."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Yeah, of course."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"I mean, how could he not?"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"I think Billy, kind of like Phil Collins,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"often felt abused by the cool kids."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Right."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"So I think when, even though Bon Iver is like,"
01:25:49;01:25:52;"to me, seems like a humble, cool guy,"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"I bet Billy would see him and be like,"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"""Oh man, you're just another hipster."""
01:25:57;01:25:59;"He would think Bon Iver is like Bruce."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Right, and Billy definitely had a chip on his shoulder"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"about Bruce."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"He'd be like--"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"You're not gonna see Bruce doing a Pepsi-sponsored thing."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Yeah, I think Billy would definitely see more of himself"
01:26:07;01:26:11;"and Beyonce and be like, ""You know what, man?"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"""That guy making his weird experimental music,"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"""he wants to take you down a peg"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"""for partnering up with Pepsi,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"""but at the end of the day, who's selling more tickets?"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"""It's you, Beyonce."
01:26:19;01:26:23;"""Who's writing songs that really resonate with people?"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"""It's you, Beyonce."""
01:26:24;01:26:25;"Okay, how about this, though?"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"Yeah."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"I feel like, in my mind, I feel like soda consciousness"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"has been raised."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"So in the '80s or the early '90s,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"people were like, ""What's wrong with sugar?"
01:26:35;01:26:36;"""You drink soda, it's fine."""
01:26:36;01:26:40;"And now it's like, post-Bloomberg, all this stuff,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"soda is like, people talk about soda"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"like it's toxic waste."
01:26:44;01:26:44;"Right, early '90s--"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"And like, childhood obesity, all this stuff."
01:26:47;01:26:50;"I mean, it is a little tone-deaf, I think, of Beyonce"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"to partner up with Pepsi."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"I think it's kind of a lame look."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"Also, it's like, why does she need to do that?"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Mm, she's loaded."
01:26:58;01:26:59;"I don't understand what she's doing."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"I'm sure she has her reasons."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"I'm sure, like--"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Why do you assume that she's loaded, man?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Do you have her routing number?"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Actually, I do, dude."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Okay, maybe--"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"No, I'm not trying to get all controversial"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"and insane on Beyonce."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"I'm just saying, like, okay,"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"you could conceivably partner up with a brand."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"If you're a rock star, you could,"
01:27:19;01:27:23;"you know, like a benevolent, loving brand like Apple."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"You could partner with them, it'd be fine."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"But it's like a funny look, I think,"
01:27:28;01:27:31;"to partner up with a soda."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"You know, and her fans are kids."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"I understand his point."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"You know, his fans are people in their 20s and 30s,"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"maybe the teenagers."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"I mean, maybe Bush Mills was a bad look."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"I think maybe--"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"I guess he said he regrets it."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"It'd be interesting to see why he regretted it,"
01:27:44;01:27:46;"if it was because it was booze, or if it was--"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Or just because it was an ad."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Just 'cause it was an ad."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Here's one question."
01:27:50;01:27:54;"Do you think there's anybody who was a Boney Bear fan"
01:27:55;01:27:59;"who loved Pepsi, who saw those comments,"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"and who was like, you know what,"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"I'm not gonna buy the new album?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"No."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Not even like a handful of people?"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"That would choose loyalty for Pepsi over Bonne Bear."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Somewhere in rural Wisconsin."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Well, especially not there."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"In the making of a murderer town."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Oh, man."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Somebody who's like a Boney Bear fan"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"waiting for the next album, but also heavily identified."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Maybe they grew up during the Cola Wars,"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"and they chose sides,"
01:28:21;01:28:22;"and they heavily identified with Pepsi."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Maybe their dad was a Pepsi distributor."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Yeah, exactly."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Northern Midwest."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"They don't care about the Beyonce angle,"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"but then Boney Bear comes out with these anti--"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"You know, it's funny too, man."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"People just wanna see beef."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"They wanna see like artist on artist beef,"
01:28:35;01:28:40;"so the takeaway from that Boney Bear interview"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"was Boney Bear criticizes Beyonce."
01:28:42;01:28:46;"Okay, like Beyonce's an icon, but is Pepsi not an icon?"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Yeah."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"What I saw there, what I found way more provocative"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"was Boney Bear criticizing Pepsi."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"Yeah, no, I hear you, man."
01:28:53;01:28:56;"I hate seeing two artists I admire get into beef, man."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"I don't think it's even beef."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"I wonder if Beyonce knows about it."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Him expressing an opinion--"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"I'm gonna tell her."
01:29:02;01:29:06;"Him expressing an opinion about her corporate partnership,"
01:29:06;01:29:09;"and him kind of like disparaging it,"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"it's not like beef."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"That's like him stating an opinion."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"He's Paul McCartney, she's Phil Collins."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"It's beef, man."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"It's not beef."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"If that's not beef, then what is?"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"It's not beef 'cause maybe she heard that"
01:29:20;01:29:23;"from her publicist and was like, ""Uh-huh."""
01:29:23;01:29:24;"What else you got?"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"You know what I would do if I was Beyonce?"

01:29:29;01:29:32;"I was gonna say mail him a two liter, but..."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"(laughing)"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Just a warm two liter."
01:29:35;01:29:36;"A warm two liter."
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Drink up, Justin."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"Oh, God."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"You know what?"

01:31:31;01:31:34;"Cousin Asher, one of our East Coast correspondents,"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"sent me a picture that Garth Brooks"
01:31:36;01:31:40;"is currently all over the packaging for Fritos."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"That's insane."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- Garth Brooks and Fritos are partnering up."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"We don't have a lot of time today to discuss it,"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"but I just want everybody to start thinking about that."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Garth Brooks and Fritos coming together."
01:31:49;01:31:52;"Is Bon Iver gonna start talking about"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"the Garth Brooks Fritos thing?"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"(laughing)"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"- If he's asked about it directly."
01:31:57;01:32:00;"- We should get-- - Tweet at him, dude."
01:32:00;01:32:01;"- We should get him on."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- Yeah, let's do it."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"- No, see, I would tweet at him,"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"but I feel like I truly respect and admire him."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"I've only met him once, but he was a truly kind person."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"I think he's a great artist."
01:32:09;01:32:11;"I feel like if I tweeted at him,"
01:32:11;01:32:12;"""Hey man, what do you think"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"""about the Garth Brooks Fritos thing?"""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"He would interpret that as shade."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"- Yeah, I got it."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"- There's no way that he would see that and be like,"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"""Oh, cool, well, man."""
01:32:21;01:32:23;"I guess in that situation, he would just see that"
01:32:23;01:32:24;"and just be like, ""You know what, man?"""
01:32:24;01:32:27;"- I'm sure he got a river of just BS"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"after that article, too, I'm sure."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"- He's just getting interviewed for something."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"That might have literally been 30 seconds."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"- Oh, I'm sure."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"- In a three hour hand session."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"- Oh, I'm sure it was."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"- And then that becomes the takeaway."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"- Of course."
01:32:38;01:32:43;"So anyway, shout out to Garth, Billy, Beyonce, and Justin."
01:32:43;01:32:47;"We love you all equally, and you're all right."
01:32:47;01:32:50;"- On the Fritos bag, there's a code you can enter"
01:32:50;01:32:54;"into a website called freegarthsong."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"What is it?"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"freegarthmusic.com?"
01:32:57;01:33:00;"- freegarthsong.com."
01:33:00;01:33:03;"- Okay, so go to your store, don't buy Fritos."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"Just take the bag, shoot a picture of it with your phone,"
01:33:07;01:33:11;"enter in the free promo code into freegarthmusic.com,"
01:33:11;01:33:14;"and listen to what I'm sure is a terrible song."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"- Oh!"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"I'm sure it's great."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"- Garth Brooks sucks."
01:33:20;01:33:23;"I know he's one of the biggest 90s sellers."
01:33:23;01:33:27;"- He's the best selling solo artist in American history, man."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He's the best selling solo artist in American history."
01:33:30;01:33:30;"- Really?"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"- Bigger than--"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"- Beyonce?"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"- Bigger than Boney Bear and Beyonce put together."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"- Get out of here."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"- Yeah, man."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Numero uno."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"- That is brutal."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"- And you wanna talk about some of these--"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"- Bigger than Elvis?"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"- Yeah, man."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"- Michael Jackson?"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"No, that's not true."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"That is not true."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"- Michael Jackson put out far fewer records."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"- Jesus."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"- Man, we could go even deeper on this,"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"but I think it's time for top five."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"You ready?"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"All right, let's get in."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"- It's time for the top five."
01:33:58;01:34:01;"Five on iTunes."
01:34:01;01:34:05;"- Today, because we covered so much ground, man,"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"we talked about Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen,"
01:34:07;01:34:11;"Boney Bear, Beyonce, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"We covered so much ground today."
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Hot Cheetos, Fritos."
01:34:14;01:34:17;"We don't have time to do comparative top five."
01:34:17;01:34:18;"- I hate that."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"- Why?"
01:34:19;01:34:22;"- Because the top five of 2016"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"only means anything to me in context."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"- You like to compare the old songs to the new songs?"
01:34:27;01:34:31;"- Yeah, it just gives it a sense of context,"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"so I can get a handle on it."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"- I'm sorry, man, we don't have time."
01:34:36;01:34:36;"- We're gonna go cold."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"We're just doing the top five songs"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"on iTunes right now in 2016."
01:34:41;01:34:41;"- You know why?"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"'Cause we're gonna hear the same crappy Chainsmokers song."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"- Oh, man."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"- And if we could compare it to something new,"
01:34:48;01:34:51;"new for the show, that is,"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"then there's a new way to talk about it."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"- When I hear you talk about Chainsmokers,"
01:34:55;01:34:58;"I totally can picture that conservative dad"
01:34:58;01:35:01;"whose kid is watching Elvis on TV."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"Turn that crap off."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"I don't get it."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"- No, because Elvis was disturbing"
01:35:07;01:35:12;"and transgressive and new."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"Everything that Chainsmokers are not."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"The Chainsmokers are pandering, unoriginal, and corporate."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"- Oh, you seem pretty disturbed by that."
01:35:19;01:35:23;"- Cliche."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"- We don't wanna get into it,"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"but there has been a lot of Chainsmokers beef, by the way."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"- Let's get into it."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"- Well, we'll talk about it later,"
01:35:28;01:35:29;"but I just want you to know,"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"you're saying all this negative stuff about Chainsmokers,"
01:35:31;01:35:35;"they're currently embroiled in a lot of beef right now."
01:35:35;01:35:38;"You're kicking 'em when they're down."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"- I guarantee you."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"- Yeah."
01:35:41;01:35:45;"- They don't give even one ounce of a crap"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"about what I have to say."
01:35:46;01:35:49;"- Don't sell yourself short, man."
01:35:49;01:35:51;"- Do you guys hear, okay, do you know Vampire Weekend?"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"Yeah, heard of 'em."
01:35:53;01:35:54;"Okay, so the singer, they--"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"- Favorite band."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"- They haven't put out a record in a while."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"The singer has a show."
01:35:58;01:36:01;"Okay, he has got some jack-off friend."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"Who's the co-host?"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"Apparently he was saying some crazy crap about us"
01:36:05;01:36:06;"on the show."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"What was he saying?"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"That we're just like sellouts and lame?"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Oh."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"That's how that conversation went."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"- Fair enough, man."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"Pass me another Cuban cigar."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"And a glass of fine wine"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"at this gorgeous beachfront villa."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"You got it, bro."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"- Get my broker on the line."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"- Get my broker on the line."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I wanna sell all my Apple stock."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"Okay, number five on the charts."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"- All right."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"- God, you really set this up to be"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"a very negative top five, man."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"You brought a lot of negative energy to it."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"And I have a feeling you're only gonna get"

01:37:01;01:37:04;"21 Pilots fans are sick of hearing you."
01:37:04;01:37:05;"- Are you serious?"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"- I at least saw one tweet where somebody said,"

01:39:13;01:39:16;"I understand your frustration,"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"but we do have something new at number three."
01:39:19;01:39:20;"- Okay."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"- I assume you're familiar with Bruno Mars."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"- Yeah."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"- And this, I'm being serious now,"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"arguably our generation's Billy Joel."
01:39:27;01:39:31;"Consistent hit maker, can do any genre."
01:39:31;01:39:34;"- Okay, I don't know why I don't know any of his songs, but."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"- Some of his early songs,"
01:39:36;01:39:37;"there's one though, something like,"
01:39:37;01:39:39;"""You're Beautiful Just the Way You Are,"""
01:39:39;01:39:41;"which Billy has a song like that too."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"He had a song called ""The Lazy Song"" that went,"
01:39:44;01:39:48;"♪ Today I don't feel like doing anything ♪"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"Just a song about being lazy, more or less."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"He had that kind of police inspired song,"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"""Box Outta Heaven."" - Right, I remember that one."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"There is no Billy Joel of this generation."
01:39:57;01:40:00;"- He's the closest thing."
01:40:00;01:40:04;"He dances, Billy didn't dance."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"- Yeah, it's not much."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"- Well, you know, his really big song with Mark"
01:40:09;01:40:10;"was ""Uptown Funk."""
01:40:10;01:40:11;"- Terrible song."
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Oh, I hate that song."
01:40:13;01:40:14;"- You hate ""Uptown Funk?"""
01:40:14;01:40:15;"- Oh, it's the worst."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"- You know, Mark Ronson was one of the first guests"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"on this show."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"- No, I don't know that."
01:40:19;01:40:20;"Who is that?"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"- Wait, do you not know who Mark Ronson is?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- No."
01:40:24;01:40:25;"- You're dead ass right now."
01:40:25;01:40:26;"- Yeah, I don't know who that is."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"- You don't know who Mark Ronson is?"
01:40:28;01:40:29;"- No, who is Mark Ronson?"
01:40:29;01:40:32;"Is it his song?"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"- Yes."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Bruno was saying it though."
01:40:35;01:40:35;"- Yeah."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"- Mark Ronson is a DJ and producer."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"He's very well known for producing"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"some of Amy Winehouse's hits."
01:40:42;01:40:43;"- Okay, British guy?"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"- Anglo-American."
01:40:46;01:40:47;"- Okay."
01:40:47;01:40:50;"- And then he made ""Uptown Funk."""
01:40:50;01:40:52;"""Uptown Funk"" is Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"- Why are you shocked that I don't know that?"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"The guy that produced Amy Winehouse,"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"who then made this crappy--"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"- Oh!"
01:40:58;01:41:02;"- Why is this so contagious?"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"It is the most stale--"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"- Oh, wow."
01:41:07;01:41:11;"- The most stale, I don't even, pop, light pop funk."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"- Jake, you know just last week,"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"""Uptown Funk"" went diamond."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"- You're saying--"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"- It sold 10 million copies."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"- You're saying the guy that produced Amy Winehouse"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"made this other song,"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"and somehow I should know who that is?"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"- Yes."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"- That's insane."
01:41:24;01:41:25;"- An iconic producer."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"- What else has he done besides Amy Winehouse?"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"- He's made his own albums."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"I don't think you know any of those songs."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Nika Costa."
01:41:33;01:41:36;"Light as a Feather."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"- Drawing a blank here, bro."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"- Did a A$AP Rocky song."
01:41:39;01:41:43;"All right, you're not familiar, I get it."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"- I know."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Wait, so where were we?"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- Well, we were talking about Bruno Mars."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"- Right."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"- So shout out to Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"- Oh, yeah, okay, ""Uptown Funk."""
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Not everybody in this room knows who you are,"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"but your song did go diamond."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"10 million copies."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"- So that's 10 million downloads?"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"- Singles, I don't know."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"- It's like eight million downloads, two million--"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"- 'Cause singles."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"CD singles, I don't know."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Okay, but so you know who Bruno Mars is?"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"- Yeah, I do."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"- So Bruno Mars had so much success with ""Uptown Funk,"""
01:42:13;01:42:15;"a universally beloved song."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"- Present company excluded."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"- You know what it's like?"
01:42:19;01:42:23;"It's like, ♪ Play that funky music, white boy ♪"
01:42:23;01:42:27;"It's like that level of just schlock crap."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"It's that bass."
01:42:30;01:42:34;"- Man, what do you do when you go to a wedding, man?"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"And they're just playing ""Uptown Funk,"""
01:42:36;01:42:38;"""Play that funky music, white boy."""

01:42:43;01:42:45;"- I don't know what kind of cock-eyed wedding"
01:42:45;01:42:48;"you're going to, they're playing ""Beast of Burden."""

01:42:52;01:42:53;"Maybe."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"Okay, so anyway, Bruno Mars is back with a single"
01:42:56;01:42:59;"that I have yet to meet a person who doesn't like this song."
01:42:59;01:43:00;"- Okay."

01:45:37;01:45:38;"They're really disappointed."

01:46:32;01:46:34;"- Quite a bit older."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"- You're still self-conscious."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"- Yeah."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"- And then you see that your favorite artist"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"has a song out."

01:46:49;01:46:50;"First verse. - Sparkly jewelry."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"- You love the intro."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"You love that funky bass."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"- Yeah."

01:47:13;01:47:14;"I don't know why."
01:47:14;01:47:15;"- Yeah."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"- Englewood, Hawaii."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"He shouts out, ""Gangsters."""
01:47:18;01:47:19;"So far, so good."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"- I thought the red and the blues thing you mentioned"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"was maybe even like a Blood Crips thing."
01:47:24;01:47:25;"- Oh, maybe."
01:47:25;01:47:29;"Maybe he's rebranding as somebody from South Central."
01:47:29;01:47:34;"- It reminded me of early '90s Dr. Dre-style rap."
01:47:34;01:47:38;"- Wait, they both have a love of that '70s, '80s funk."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Yeah, they have similar influence."
01:47:40;01:47:42;"So anyway, you're listening to the second verse."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"- Shouts out the gangsters."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"Shouts out the hustlers."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"Nothing wrong with gangsters or hustlers."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"We all gotta make a living."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Then he shouts out, ""Bad bitches."""
01:47:52;01:47:53;"- Cool."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"- Yeah, bad bitches is a positive thing."
01:47:56;01:47:59;"Unless you really have a problem with the word bitch,"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"which increasingly people don't in that usage."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"So you're loving it."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"You're loving the second verse so far."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"And then he tacks a little something onto the bad bitches."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"And you're ugly-ass friends."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"- Cold."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"- It's cold."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"And maybe you're somebody who,"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"when you go out with your friends,"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"there's one that gets a lot of attention,"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"and you've even had some jerk."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- I hate that."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- I'm ruining the song for you, aren't I?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"- No, I hate seeing that dynamic."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"You see a bunch of girls."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"- I think there really is somebody."
01:48:26;01:48:26;"- It's rough."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"- There really is somebody for everybody."
01:48:28;01:48:29;"- Sure, absolutely."
01:48:29;01:48:33;"- And by the way, even if you're considered good-looking,"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"all you have to do to become the quote-unquote"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"ugly person in the group is to go hang out"
01:48:37;01:48:39;"with a better-looking person."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"We're all just a beautiful person away"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"from being the ugly friend."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"- That's why I'm on this show."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"- Oh no."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"I'm saying like--"
01:48:47;01:48:48;"- This is radio."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"- In a certain group of people,"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"trying to think of a good,"
01:48:52;01:48:55;"like Matt Damon might be the hot one."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- Yeah."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"- And in another group, he might not."
01:48:57;01:49:00;"- Okay, if Matt Damon's hanging out with like Mark Wahlberg."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"- Mark Wahlberg's the hot one."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Who's hotter?"
01:49:03;01:49:03;"Okay."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"Damon's got like that real thick neck."
01:49:05;01:49:06;"(laughing)"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"- Brad Pitt."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"But anyway, no, but I'm being serious for a second."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"- What are we even talking about?"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"- But I'm being serious."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"Like when I saw that comment,"
01:49:12;01:49:15;"it really did make me feel kind of sad."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"'Cause like, what we're talking about,"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"like sometimes on this show, we make outlandish,"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"I'm willing to admit, maybe there are no Boney Bear fans"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"that stop supporting him"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"because of his negative Pepsi comments."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- Yeah."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"- Maybe I'm wrong about that."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"There might be none."
01:49:29;01:49:33;"But there's so many people, both genders,"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"of all genders, I should say,"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"who feel self-conscious about the way they look."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"There could be hundreds of thousands of people"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"for whom that you're amazing just the way you are,"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"whatever that song's called, ""Beautiful"" or something,"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"was meaningful."
01:49:46;01:49:50;"And then the ""Ugly Friends"" line just hurts."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"- Yeah, but at the same time--"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"- You still like it more than Uptown Funk, Jake?"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"- Oh yeah, absolutely."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"It's full of surprises, I like it."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"I mean, Uptown Funk was just like the most,"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"I don't need to talk about Uptown Funk anymore."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"It was just, there were no surprises."
01:50:03;01:50:06;"I was like shocked how generic that song was."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"- That's it."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"- But to your point on the lyrics,"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"it's sad that they wrote that YouTube comment,"
01:50:11;01:50:16;"but they also can't invest too much in that song."
01:50:16;01:50:20;"And Bruno Mars should not think twice"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"about putting lyrics like that into his songs if he wants."
01:50:24;01:50:27;"- You like from a freedom of speech angle?"
01:50:27;01:50:30;"- Yeah, do what he wants to do artistically."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"Not all his music should be aspirational."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"It doesn't need to be feel-good aspirational stuff."
01:50:35;01:50:39;"And if people don't like that, then that's the way it goes."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"- Very Donald Trump of you."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"- Freedom for the artist, man."
01:50:42;01:50:43;"Freedom for the artist."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"- All right, I hear you."
01:50:44;01:50:47;"Moving on in the top five, we got Maroon 5."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"This is a new one on the charts."
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Do you like Maroon 5?"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"- No."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"- Okay, it's featuring Kendrick Lamar."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"You like Kendrick Lamar?"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"- Oh wow, yeah, I do actually."
01:50:55;01:50:56;"That's okay."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"This is an interesting combination."

01:55:06;01:55:10;"- That is a lukewarm endorsement."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"- A lukewarm endorsement."
01:55:12;01:55:16;"I mean, that's a catchy song."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Apparently there's been some beef."
01:55:18;01:55:18;"- What's the beef?"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Fill me in."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- I don't actually know what the beef is."

01:55:22;01:55:25;"- I think I don't wanna know, Maroon 5, what the beef is."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- You wanna know."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"- Can somebody in the room give us the beef real quick?"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"- You wanna know, dude."
01:55:28;01:55:31;"- We gotta get Seinfeld 2000 on the mic for a second."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"I want Seinfeld 2000 to explain the beef."
01:55:33;01:55:33;"- Jason, jump in."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"- Okay, so I'm just finding out about this myself right now,"
01:55:36;01:55:39;"but basically Chainsmokers were not--"
01:55:39;01:55:43;"- Wait, you mean they weren't talking about this on the Seinfeld fan message boards?"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"- All right, Ezra."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"- You know, you bring me on the mic and then you just persecute me."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"- I'm not persecuting you, man."
01:55:48;01:55:48;"All right."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"- All right, well--"
01:55:50;01:55:50;"- What's going on?"
01:55:50;01:55:53;"- You know, apparently Chainsmokers did not mince words."
01:55:53;01:55:57;"They said some things about Lady Gaga's single ""Perfect Illusion""."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Okay?"
01:55:58;01:56:03;"There was a Rolling Stone article where Alex Paul proclaimed, and I quote,"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"""It sucks when talking about the song."""
01:56:07;01:56:10;"And then Drew Taggart, the other Chainsmokers, came through and just said,"

01:56:12;01:56:13;"You know, he stayed out of it."
01:56:13;01:56:19;"And then it looks like when Gaga, you know, when she put out the song,"
01:56:19;01:56:24;"she tagged the Chainsmokers and the new song being ""A-Yo"","
01:56:24;01:56:27;"the follow-up to ""Perfect Illusion"", she tweeted,"

01:56:47;01:56:48;"- Not even a beef."
01:56:48;01:56:51;"- It's more, it's pork, anything."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"- That's, yeah, that's some pork."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"- Chicken."

01:56:57;01:56:58;"- So what?"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"- So Jake, that's what happens when you tell somebody that their song sucks."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"- What a waste of time."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"- What?"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"- That whole beef segment."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"- Beef."

01:57:11;01:57:12;"But it's good, she didn't flip out."
01:57:12;01:57:14;"- She handled it like a champ."
01:57:14;01:57:14;"- Yeah."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"- All respect."
01:57:15;01:57:21;"- The Chainsmokers have no legs to stand on to be throwing shade at huge pop stars."

01:57:38;01:57:38;"- Yeah."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"- There's gotta be a better way to say it."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"One for the--"

01:57:46;01:57:47;"No."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"- This show was one for posterity."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"This show will go down in history."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"- That's a super chill expression."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"- We really covered a lot, man."
01:57:54;01:57:58;"We covered old dudes, snack foods."
01:57:58;01:58:03;"Little by little on this show, I think we're starting to understand the way the world"
01:58:03;01:58:03;"works."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"- Chippin' away."
01:58:05;01:58:06;"- Chippin' away very slowly."
01:58:06;01:58:09;"Thank you for joining me, as always."
01:58:09;01:58:09;"- Of course."
01:58:09;01:58:12;"- To everybody listening at home, keep those emails coming."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"We appreciate it."
01:58:14;01:58:19;"It doesn't just have to be about corporate history and classic rock, although--"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"- I prefer classic rock emails."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"- Jake prefers it, so."
01:58:22;01:58:27;"We'll be back in two weeks on the eve of the presidential election."
01:58:27;01:58:31;"- That'll be Sunday, November 6th, I think."
01:58:31;01:58:33;"- Yeah, two days before the election, so."
01:58:33;01:58:34;"- Jeez Louise."
01:58:34;01:58:35;"- We'll have to talk about it."
01:58:35;01:58:35;"Right now, I think--"
01:58:35;01:58:36;"- That's gonna be stressful."
01:58:36;01:58:41;"- I think Donald Trump has, according to the New York Times, which to be fair, is a liberal--"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"- A failing New York Times."
01:58:43;01:58:46;"- A failing liberal newspaper based in New York City."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"They say that Donald Trump has a 9% chance of winning."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"- Well, thank God."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"- So you're saying there's a chance."
01:58:51;01:58:55;"So whatever, we'll talk about the election, probably a little bit more about the Frito-Lay"
01:58:55;01:58:56;"Corporation."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"We'll see."
01:58:57;01:58:59;"Anyway, thanks for listening, guys."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"This really was an important episode."
01:59:01;01:59:04;"If I do say so myself, I will see you in two weeks."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"- Beats Juan."
01:59:05;01:59:05;"- Worldwide."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"- Always on."
