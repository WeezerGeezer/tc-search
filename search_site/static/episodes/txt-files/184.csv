00:00;00:06;"It's 2022, and it's not just the 30th anniversary of Alice in Chains' Dirt."
00:06;00:08;"We'll also be talking about Tully's,"
00:08;00:16;"The Coffee Chain, plus Jake's favorite band, Second Grade."
00:16;00:21;"All that, plus Marquis Moon by Television."
00:21;00:26;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:16;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:16;01:18;"Good morning, sir."
01:18;01:22;"Good morning. Very early for me over here."
01:22;01:23;"What time is it?"
01:23;01:29;"7 a.m. Probably some people don't think that's that early, but for me, that's very early to be"
01:29;01:30;"up and at them."
01:30;01:34;"That's early to start a radio show. This is like morning drive time style."
01:34;01:38;"This might be the earliest I've ever done Time Crisis."
01:38;01:42;"Oh, I think so. I don't think we've never done it this early in the States."
01:42;01:47;"But I like to think about you last night, around 6 p.m., like, ""I got to hit the hay."
01:47;01:48;"I got to work in the morning."""
01:48;01:53;"You have those insane morning drive time hours where they're getting up at 2 to go to work."
01:53;01:55;"I mean, that's crossed my mind before."
01:55;02:01;"It's especially funny because there's a lot of people who have to wake up early for work,"
02:01;02:07;"but then you throw in the showbiz element where it's like, ""I got to be up and at them."
02:07;02:11;"I got to be radio ready at 5.30."""
02:11;02:12;"Yeah."
02:12;02:17;"I wonder if you're the family of some drive time radio person."
02:17;02:18;"Do you have your own bedroom?"
02:18;02:21;"Howard Stern talks about this all the time."
02:21;02:26;"He goes to bed. He eats dinner at 5.30, and he is in bed by 8, 8.30."
02:26;02:32;"He has his own bed, and I think he talks about how his family's always been just really miserable."
02:32;02:37;"I mean, that's him, who I think would make others suffer."
02:37;02:38;"Yeah, that's kind of like..."
02:38;02:44;"And also, that's his shtick to be like, ""It's totally insane. I'm a freak. I drive everybody"
02:44;02:45;"crazy."""
02:45;02:50;"There's something about you telling Rashida and the family, ""Guys, I want everybody quiet"
02:50;02:52;"around 8.30. I have to wake up to do Time Crisis."""
02:52;02:57;"Earlier, ""I need a 12-hour window."""
02:57;02:57;"Yeah, exactly."
02:57;03:02;"""At 7 p.m., we'll go on library rolls. I don't want to hear a peep above a whisper."
03:02;03:04;"I got to be ready to do the radio."""
03:05;03:11;"Whereas you guys are sitting pretty there mid-afternoon yesterday in Los Angeles."
03:11;03:12;"3 p.m., baby."
03:12;03:13;"Love it."
03:23;03:25;"It's oh so still."
03:25;03:33;"Shh, shh, you're all alone."
03:33;03:39;"Shh, shh, and so peaceful until..."
03:40;03:43;"You fall in love."
03:43;03:44;"Sinful."
03:44;03:46;"The sky up above."
03:46;03:48;"Sinful."
03:48;03:50;"It's caving in."
03:50;03:52;"[Screaming]"
03:52;03:56;"You've never been so nuts about a guy you wanna love."
03:56;03:58;"You wanna cry, you cross your heart and hope to die."
03:58;04:01;"'Til it's over."
04:01;04:05;"One thing I wanted to start with, just speaking of being in Japan,"
04:05;04:09;"have we ever talked about the Tully's coffee chain?"
04:09;04:09;"No."
04:09;04:12;"So I wanted to talk about it because it's very ubiquitous here, and"
04:12;04:15;"I've been drinking a lot of Tully's coffee, actually."
04:15;04:19;"And it's one of... There's something funny about, especially in Tokyo,"
04:19;04:23;"it's a big cosmopolitan international city, so unsurprisingly,"
04:23;04:29;"you're gonna have a lot of the same stuff that you have in every big western city."
04:29;04:34;"Of course, you have the giant global chains, McDonald's, Starbucks."
04:34;04:38;"We've discussed how there's, you know, can be the slight regional differences."
04:38;04:42;"By the way, I never actually got the sweet potato frappuccino here."
04:42;04:44;"Sold out everywhere."
04:44;04:48;"I've noticed as I walk past a lot of Starbucks, they slapped a big sold out sign on it."
04:48;04:49;"Is that sign in English?"
04:49;04:50;"Yes."
04:50;04:53;"Yeah, it's usually sold out in English."
04:53;04:53;"All right."
04:53;04:55;"I don't know if you have some insight."
04:55;05:01;"I've never truly been able to understand how much stuff is in English here."
05:01;05:07;"People want to project a kind of cool international flavor by putting your sign in English."
05:07;05:09;"I can't totally follow the logic."
05:09;05:12;"I mean, it's useful being an English speaking person here, how much stuff is in English."
05:12;05:14;"But yeah, then sometimes it's only in English."
05:14;05:18;"Sometimes you'll hear some J-pop songs and a few lines will just be in English."
05:18;05:20;"Just for the sort of aesthetic."
05:20;05:20;"Right."
05:20;05:25;"And then famously, you have the aesthetic English t-shirts all over the world."
05:25;05:27;"That's a two way street."
05:27;05:32;"Of course, you walk around Japan, let alone, you know, any other country where you'll see"
05:32;05:35;"some grandma wearing a shirt that says like, I haven't seen any."
05:35;05:38;"I haven't seen anything quite as crazy as you."
05:38;05:42;"But you just see the kind of like, OK, now listen up."
05:42;05:43;"I'm number one."
05:43;05:46;"And if you don't understand, that's on fire."
05:47;05:50;"I've seen some of that stuff, which, of course, is a two way street."
05:50;05:56;"Famously, there are many Americans with a tattoo, Japanese characters that says something"
05:56;05:57;"nonsensical."
05:57;06:00;"But sold out isn't communicating an aesthetic."
06:00;06:02;"It's telling you."
06:02;06:08;"So someone, the Japanese have to be able to understand that English language phrase."
06:08;06:12;"I suspect it's an Anglicism that is recognizable."
06:12;06:14;"That's that's I think I think it's one of those."
06:14;06:18;"Right. Like it's possible that something based on sold out."
06:18;06:19;"There's like a Japanese version."
06:19;06:20;"Yeah."
06:20;06:25;"Or it's a discriminatory policy where it's only sold out for foreigners."
06:25;06:26;"Oh, for the gaijin."
06:26;06:27;"Yeah."
06:27;06:32;"Oh, well, OK, I'm going to have to do some investigative journalism then."
06:32;06:34;"Just walk into Japanese Starbucks."
06:34;06:35;"Hey, excuse me."
06:35;06:36;"I noticed it said sold out."
06:36;06:38;"They're like, hmm."
06:38;06:39;"Yes, sorry, it's sold out."
06:39;06:43;"Then Japanese person goes in with the flawless Japanese."
06:44;06:46;"They walk right out with a sweet potato Frappuccino."
06:46;06:48;"It's possible."
06:48;06:50;"But anyway, I was saying, you know, there's so many."
06:50;06:55;"Obviously, there's so many Western chains here, at least in Tokyo and Tokyo might be,"
06:55;06:59;"you know, a bit exceptional, but there's it's so much deeper than just McDonald's and Starbucks."
06:59;07:02;"There's Denny's, Carl's Jr."
07:02;07:05;"There's even like one Shakey's pizza."
07:05;07:08;"There's Krispy Kreme."
07:08;07:10;"There's all that stuff."
07:10;07:17;"But then there's this other phenomenon, which is American chains that no longer exist in America."
07:17;07:22;"And that's interesting because there is there is a funny thing I've been feeling being in Japan"
07:22;07:28;"for a while now of there's something about commerce that feels pleasantly old school,"
07:28;07:33;"even in a big city like Tokyo."
07:33;07:40;"People use cash and coins so much more here than I find in New York or L.A.,"
07:40;07:41;"which is kind of pleasantly old school."
07:41;07:46;"And there's something about I don't know, the department stores feel more vibrant"
07:46;07:49;"in a way, almost like it's still the mid 90s."
07:49;07:52;"There's just something kind of like 90s about the commerce."
07:52;07:57;"So anyway, there's a few of these chains that died in the U.S."
07:57;08:00;"that I'm not going to say they're thriving in Japan, but they're like holding on."
08:01;08:06;"So one, I mean, this is a pretty New York one, but you know, Dean and DeLuca,"
08:06;08:09;"you ever hit that jig back in your in your brief New York days?"
08:09;08:11;"Maybe once or twice. Sure. I'm familiar."
08:11;08:14;"So for anybody who doesn't know, because it's a bit regional,"
08:14;08:18;"Dean and DeLuca was like, I think, starting in the early 80s,"
08:18;08:26;"like Basquiat era downtown New York, Soho was this kind of new school gourmet supermarket."
08:26;08:28;"It was around for a long time."
08:28;08:32;"It moved locations, but there's always there's this big one in Soho."
08:32;08:38;"And it was kind of like the epitome of that era of New York's kind of a high ceiling,"
08:38;08:43;"old Soho building with food from around the world, really nice,"
08:43;08:48;"like Italian imports and good pre-made food, good coffee,"
08:48;08:51;"you know, kind of like a cool New York grocery store."
08:51;08:53;"I grew up next to one in Washington, D.C."
08:53;08:54;"They had one in D.C.?"
08:54;08:56;"OK, maybe it's not quite as regional as I think."
08:56;08:59;"And I think it expanded. I think it was there."
08:59;09:03;"It was I think you see them a lot now, whether it's a cookbook or something."
09:03;09:08;"I know it's bigger, but it was like to me that first, like you said, gourmet grocer."
09:08;09:09;"Yeah."
09:09;09:10;"Food prep place."
09:10;09:14;"They were killing it. Late 20th century, East Coast America."
09:14;09:15;"They were doing their thing."
09:15;09:16;"Know it well."
09:16;09:22;"I'm all lost in the supermarket. I can no longer shop happily."
09:22;09:28;"I came in here for a special offer. Guaranteed personality."
09:28;09:35;"I wasn't born so much as I fell out. Nobody seemed to notice me."
09:35;09:42;"We had a hedge back home in the suburb over which I never could see."
09:43;09:47;"I heard the people who live on the ceiling scream and fight."
09:47;09:53;"Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling."
09:53;09:55;"That's how it's been all around me."
09:55;10:01;"I'm all lost in the supermarket. I can no longer shop happily."
10:01;10:08;"I came in here for a special offer. Guaranteed personality."
10:08;10:12;"And then eventually they started having just like little cafes that, you know,"
10:12;10:16;"was not like a whole grocery store, but yeah, more or less like a"
10:16;10:21;"Starbucks with maybe slightly more junk you could buy, cookies and stuff."
10:21;10:26;"But they did their thing. I'm sure at some point, private equity got in the mix and"
10:26;10:32;"wanted to expand. Because on the one hand, you're kind of like, how did it go so wrong?"
10:32;10:36;"You had this kind of like iconic downtown New York, little market."
10:37;10:42;"Even the last time I went to the Soho one, always jammed with people."
10:42;10:46;"How did that fall apart? And almost always, I'm not even going to double check."
10:46;10:47;"Yeah, yeah. That's not even there anymore."
10:47;10:50;"Dean and DeLucas is out in the US."
10:50;10:53;"The original Soho one is not there. It essentially doesn't exist in the US."
10:53;11:00;"There's a handful of cafes still around. The big market doesn't exist."
11:00;11:04;"And maybe Seinfeld, can we get a number crunch? It's a classic story where basically"
11:04;11:12;"a beloved institution gets infused with money, maybe sold, expands, cannot hold the territory."
11:12;11:16;"Yeah, the soul's been ripped out."
11:16;11:21;"The soul's been ripped out. The forward operating bases are in hostile territory."
11:21;11:27;"They're not getting support from the mothership. And then the whole empire collapses."
11:27;11:32;"Yeah, they filed for bankruptcy in 2020, Chapter 11 protection,"
11:32;11:36;"liabilities, 500 million, assets of under 50 million."
11:36;11:40;"When they filed, they were owned by Thailand's Pace Development Corp."
11:40;11:44;"They're headquartered in Wichita, Kansas."
11:44;11:45;"Oh my God."
11:45;11:51;"Wait, what? It's a Thailand X Kansas collab?"
11:51;11:58;"They originated in Kansas. It got acquired at some point by a Thai company called Pace"
11:58;11:59;"Development."
11:59;12:02;"Wait, what originated in Kansas? Dean and DeLuca?"
12:02;12:03;"Dean and DeLuca."
12:03;12:04;"No, wait, wait, wait."
12:04;12:09;"It's an American, here, according to Wikipedia, it's an American chain of upscale grocery stores."
12:09;12:15;"We know that. The first one established in Soho by Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca and Jack"
12:15;12:22;"Sealdrick in '77. And then they were joined in '79 by Eugenio Botellini."
12:22;12:27;"I love that it's '77. This like incredibly important year for like American punk rock"
12:27;12:28;"and Dean and DeLuca."
12:28;12:29;"Yep."
12:29;12:33;"I mean, I'm not trying to be crass, but like these art and commerce, they go hand in hand."
12:33;12:34;"That makes so much sense."
12:34;12:42;"1977, downtown New York, Dean and DeLuca, Talking Head '77, Marquee Moon, television."
12:42;12:49;"That's sophisticated rock for college educated people."
12:49;12:52;"Okay, but the HQ, HQ is in Wichita."
12:52;12:53;"Yes."
12:53;12:54;"Wichita, Kansas."
12:54;12:56;"That must've been, yeah, why, at some point-"
12:56;12:57;"That's part of the restructuring."
12:57;13:04;"That was like a Wichita based private equity firm came out and bought up Dean and DeLuca."
13:04;13:06;"I mean, I respect that. The heartland strikes back."
13:06;13:13;"I'm still in a dream of 1977 where I've just picked up Marquee Moon on vinyl down the street,"
13:13;13:19;"and I'm popping by Dean and DeLuca's to pick, to hit that olive bar, maybe get some Buffalo"
13:19;13:28;"mozzarella with a really nice freshly baked loaf of rosemary sourdough."
13:28;13:29;"Oh, I can totally picture it."
13:29;13:36;"I'm having people over that night, got some nice wine, throwing that television record."
13:36;13:40;"Just the epitome of a sophisticated downtown New Yorker."
13:40;13:40;"Yeah."
13:40;13:44;"You could be 20 something, could be even early 30s."
13:45;13:52;"Just listening to the book I read by Talking Heads, making a really nice salad with some"
13:52;13:59;"extra virgin olive oil that you picked up at Dean and DeLuca, having a sophisticated loft party."
13:59;14:01;"Arguing about Annie Hall."
14:01;14:04;"Yep. Annie Hall's in theaters. Damn, that's a big era for New York."
14:04;14:11;"I'm writing about the book I read. I have to sing about the book I read."
14:11;14:15;"I'm embarrassed to admit it hit the soft spot in my heart when"
14:15;14:23;"I found out you wrote the book I read. So I'll take my shoulders and then touch your heart."
14:23;14:31;"I'm a little cautious but I feel alright. The book I read was in your eyes."
14:32;14:36;"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, oh."
14:36;14:42;"I'm living in the future. I feel wonderful."
14:42;14:46;"I'm tipping over backwards. I'm so ambitious."
14:46;14:51;"I'm looking back. I'm running a race and you're the book I read."
14:51;14:59;"So feel my fingers as they touch your heart. I'm not spinning around and I feel alright."
14:59;15:04;"The book I read was in your eyes."
15:04;15:09;"Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
15:09;15:13;"I feel like I'd be depressed if we looked it up, but I bet you could probably do some"
15:13;15:22;"similar things to kind of like our era of New York, like 2008, 2009. I wonder what kind of like"
15:22;15:23;"stores started."
15:23;15:25;"I hit that whole food in Union Square."
15:25;15:28;"Well, yeah, maybe it's just not as fun. It's like..."
15:28;15:30;"Oh yeah, what stores started like..."
15:30;15:34;"In 2009, the year Bitta Orca and..."
15:34;15:35;"Contra?"
15:35;15:36;"Well, Contra..."
15:36;15:36;"Contra's 10."
15:36;15:37;"We're on different years."
15:37;15:41;"You picked up Contra and you went to the first Sweet Greens."
15:41;15:43;"There could be something like that."
15:43;15:47;"Yeah, are there any chains that emerged out of Brooklyn, out of that Brooklyn,"
15:47;15:54;"like peak Brooklyn circa whatever, '09? Are there any, like even on a small level, like..."
15:54;15:58;"Oh, like Five Leaves. There's one in... It's not a chain, but there's a Five Leaves."
15:58;16:02;"There's kind of a Five Leaves in LA. Yeah, see, there's these smaller chains. I mean,"
16:02;16:05;"I don't know when it started. It's not Brooklyn, but you know, there's this,"
16:05;16:08;"there's a New York restaurant, Jack's Wife Frida."
16:08;16:10;"Yeah, I actually went there last time I was in New York."
16:10;16:12;"That's funny, Jake, because..."
16:12;16:13;"Soho."
16:13;16:19;"I had lunch at Jack's Wife Frida Roppongi in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago."
16:19;16:22;"Wow. I didn't know they had that far of a reach."
16:22;16:29;"I think there's like six Jack's Wife Fridas, three in New York and like three in Tokyo."
16:29;16:34;"So, you know, it's not the market penetration of like a Starbucks where you could probably be like"
16:34;16:39;"in like the jungle somewhere and find like a Starbucks at the airport."
16:39;16:43;"Sometimes I think you find these places that, you know, where there's like seven of them."
16:43;16:43;"Yeah."
16:43;16:47;"And you're like, ""Whoa, all over the world."" And really it's like, well, yeah,"
16:47;16:50;"one person opened a few in Tokyo, one person opened a few in New York, one person opened"
16:50;16:56;"one in London, which is like cosmopolitan in a sense, but also kind of a small slice of the world."
16:56;17:00;"But anyway, the reason I brought up Dine and Deluca is that it's one of these things where"
17:00;17:07;"I remember going whenever it was a few years ago when the big iconic Soho one closed."
17:07;17:10;"I just remember going in there and it was a little bit depressing because, you know,"
17:10;17:16;"they're trying to sell the last of their goods for bargain basement prices."
17:16;17:23;"So, like the last week of Dine and Deluca, you'd go in and obviously they're not ordering more"
17:23;17:29;"avocados and persimmons or whatever. So, all those shelves are empty and then they're still"
17:29;17:37;"trying to sell the last cooking supply, cooking wares, spatulas and stuff, some Italian flour."
17:37;17:40;"So, it was getting emptier and emptier. It was kind of depressing."
17:40;17:42;"But then I don't know how many there are in Japan."
17:42;17:43;"50."
17:43;17:43;"Wow."
17:43;17:47;"There's quite a few and some of them are just cafes, but then some of them,"
17:47;17:52;"none of them are as big as the Soho one, but some of them are little markets."
17:52;17:58;"I've been to one that had that kind of like late 20th century cornucopia feeling of like going"
17:58;18:03;"into Dine and Deluca and there's like so many bougie products spilling everywhere in a big"
18:03;18:10;"kind of deli hot bar where they're making all this nice stuff and wine and all those things."
18:10;18:16;"And at least in Tokyo, maybe I might just notice it the most because I speak English and I know"
18:16;18:22;"the Dine and Deluca logo. I also just notice young urban professionals with a little Dine"
18:22;18:27;"and Deluca tote bag quite a bit just walking the streets. So, it's an example of one of these"
18:27;18:32;"things that are at 50 stores, that's pretty good in Japan where something essentially tanked in"
18:32;18:36;"the US. And I think there may be literally, I think in New York, there might just be like one"
18:36;18:42;"little Dine and Deluca cafe left somewhere in the lobby of a building or something, but then in Japan"
18:42;18:48;"it's still thriving. So, there's quite a few of these things where a chain basically ended in the"
18:48;18:53;"US and still lives here. Like they still have a Toys R Us in Japan. I don't know enough to say"
18:53;18:59;"if it's like thriving, but I have stepped foot inside a Toys R Us in Japan, which I believe"
18:59;19:05;"there's zero left in the US, right? It's one of those kind of seer situations where it's sort of"
19:05;19:09;"like, are there seers? I think there are still some seers. I think there's-"
19:09;19:10;"Like I heard it went out of business."
19:10;19:15;"Yeah. It's been restructured like a dozen times. I feel like there probably are some"
19:15;19:18;"Toys R Us, but I could be wrong. It might be all gone."
19:18;19:22;"There may be one in Times Square. I don't think they shut that one down."
19:22;19:23;"Did they shut it down?"
19:23;19:24;"I don't know."
19:24;19:26;"Matt's shaking his head. I don't know."
19:26;19:26;"It's a Halloween square."
19:26;19:28;"We're on the edge of our seat here."
19:28;19:33;"Is there a Toys R Us? While we number crunch if there's a Toys R Us, this is a little Dine"
19:33;19:38;"and DeLuca tidbit that I find interesting. When you said, trying to think of stories of our time,"
19:38;19:41;"I was like, ""Oh, at least in Los Angeles, Air One is a very big deal."""
19:41;19:42;"Sure."
19:42;19:47;"And I think, ""Oh, what if that was something that came up around 2009?"" I looked it up"
19:47;19:49;"and it turns out, first of all-"
19:49;19:50;"Oh, Air One's from the 70s."
19:50;19:56;"It was founded in 1980. But this is interesting. The current CEO, Tony"
19:56;20:04;"Antoche, bought the company in 2011 after initially looking into being a Dine and DeLuca franchisee."
20:04;20:05;"Whoa."
20:05;20:05;"Okay."
20:05;20:06;"Oh, I love that."
20:06;20:10;"And he said, ""Hey, you know what? That's not going to fly. I see the end of that."
20:10;20:11;"I see the horizon line on that."""
20:11;20:18;"I'd love to talk to this guy. And also just for our listeners who don't live within the New York,"
20:18;20:25;"LA axis of evil, Air One is still, I believe, only in LA. And just like Dine and DeLuca,"
20:26;20:34;"represented this downtown New York, sophisticated, Annie Hall, Marquis Moon sensibility in '77,"
20:34;20:39;"Air One... Okay. I thought it was starting in the '70s. It started in 1980. I'm aware of Air One,"
20:39;20:45;"people in my life who grew up in LA. Air One at first was a hippie place, a cool hippie market"
20:45;20:49;"that represented... There were many of those from the '60s."
20:49;20:51;"The natural foods movement."
20:51;20:55;"Yeah. The natural foods movement, LA hippie stuff. I feel like Rashida told me they used"
20:55;20:58;"to have hay on the floor or something. It was funky."
20:58;21:01;"Where was the original Air One?"
21:01;21:06;"I don't think it was all that far from the one on Beverly now. I think it was roughly in that"
21:06;21:13;"Hollywood, West Hollywood vibe. And Air One is named after that novel. It's not quite"
21:13;21:18;"nowhere backwards, but it's something about a utopian ideal. So anyway, just like Dine and"
21:18;21:23;"DeLuca represented a New York vibe, Air One represented an LA vibe. And then as the years"
21:23;21:28;"went on, Air One kept up with the times. It didn't stay with that stuffy old hippie thing."
21:28;21:34;"It became the new LA, green juice, smoothies, that turbocharged..."
21:34;21:35;"Expensive."
21:35;21:37;"Yeah. Hippie means expensive."
21:37;21:39;"Yeah. According to Air One..."
21:39;21:44;"AirOneMarket.com says their first location was actually in Boston."
21:44;21:45;"Oh, really?"
21:45;21:46;"It was just a stall."
21:46;21:47;"A stall?"
21:47;21:48;"A 10 by 20..."
21:48;21:49;"Like in a farmer's market?"
21:49;21:54;"Like farmer's market style, but they're claiming that that's the first location,"
21:54;21:56;"first store of its kind in America."
21:56;22:02;"Let me guess, a young man went to Harvard or BU or Berkeley School of Music,"
22:02;22:07;"was really into natural foods, started a stall, getting a little bit of traction,"
22:07;22:11;"but he had this feeling like he wasn't getting enough respect from the mass holes."
22:11;22:19;"He's like, I just don't see my utopian vision for a natural foods kind of a market thriving in"
22:19;22:20;"Boston."
22:20;22:22;"I mean, close."
22:22;22:24;"He got out a map and said..."
22:24;22:26;"Go West, young man."
22:26;22:27;"I want to go West."
22:27;22:33;"I mean, in a bit of a full circle moment, the co-founder of Air One is actually Japanese,"
22:33;22:38;"was a teacher who advocated for macrobiotic diets and world peace."
22:38;22:41;"Avaline Kushi is her name."
22:41;22:47;"And it actually says on Wikipedia that she opened it in Brookline, Massachusetts in the 60s."
22:48;22:49;"A lot to unpack there."
22:49;22:50;"Keep going."
22:50;22:51;"I'm on the edge of my seat."
22:51;22:52;"Yeah."
22:52;22:58;"Kushi promoted the macrobiotic philosophy and diet, a Taoist influenced spiritual practice"
22:58;23:00;"emphasizing organic and seasonal foods."
23:00;23:05;"She was born in Yokota, Japan, worked as a schoolteacher until the end of World War II."
23:05;23:12;"So she must have been pretty old when she moved the operation to LA in 80."
23:12;23:14;"She would have been 67."
23:14;23:15;"Wow."
23:15;23:16;"Respect."
23:16;23:17;"Weight, 57."
23:17;23:19;"Yeah, it is funny to think."
23:19;23:20;"I feel like there's other stories like this."
23:20;23:27;"You think about the Boston area probably being a hotbed in the 60s of left-wing politics with"
23:27;23:30;"all these universities there."
23:30;23:36;"So of course, you're going to have like cool, vibrant, progressive cultural institutions"
23:36;23:38;"and even like supermarkets starting there."
23:38;23:46;"And obviously, a lot of these people eventually moved to a place like LA, a newer city."
23:47;23:48;"Go West."
23:48;23:51;"You know, the American imagination running free."
23:51;23:54;"That's where you can really start something new."
23:54;23:58;"It's not like Boston is-- obviously, Boston's this like very liberal place."
23:58;24:00;"These places have made their mark."
24:00;24:04;"But yeah, it just makes sense that there are probably so many people there who in the 60s"
24:04;24:07;"were like, yeah, yeah, I love the Boston area."
24:07;24:08;"And eventually, these people end up in LA."
24:08;24:12;"The renowned health food restaurant, Boston Market."
24:12;24:14;"Yeah, exactly."

25:36;25:38;"and being like, ""All right,"
25:38;25:41;"I've got $350 million to invest."
25:41;25:44;"On the one hand, I see Dean and DeLuca,"
25:44;25:46;"Annie Hall, Markie Moon vibes."
25:46;25:48;"I feel like that already kind of-- that already had its revival,"
25:48;25:51;"kind of came and went in the early 2000s."
25:51;25:55;"On the other hand, I see Erewhon,"
25:55;25:58;"this kind of old L.A. hippie thing"
25:58;25:59;"that seems to be revitalized"
25:59;26:03;"with this kind of West Hollywood Kardashian"
26:03;26:06;"$20 smoothie thing."
26:06;26:08;"The choice is clear."
26:08;26:11;"I'm betting big on the $20 juices."
26:11;26:13;"That Markie Moon [bleep] played out, dog."
26:13;26:18;"I mean, what's the band that corresponds to Erewhon in 1980?"
26:18;26:19;"I mean, I want to say Fleetwood Mac,"
26:19;26:22;"but they're doing too much coke."
26:22;26:23;"-I mean, in a way. -It's like--"
26:23;26:26;"Or like some new-age musician, like Stephen Alpern."
26:26;26:28;"Like some new-age musician."
26:28;26:30;"I think the Erewhon vibe changed."
26:30;26:34;"I think, like, in 1980, yeah, it's probably a bit of, like, yacht rock."
26:34;26:37;"It's probably a bit of, like, health food and cocaine vibes,"
26:37;26:39;"-bananas and blow. -Bananas and blow."
26:39;26:41;"But certainly by 2011,"
26:41;26:45;"I think Erewhon had gone through a metamorphosis,"
26:45;26:49;"and there's probably very little vestige of the old hippie thing,"
26:49;26:53;"and Erewhon was starting to become, I don't know, like, truly--"
26:53;26:57;"It's almost more like some Travis Scott-type [bleep]"
26:57;26:59;"-Yeah. -Well, I think my first introduction--"
26:59;27:01;"-There's no band. -My introduction to Erewhon--"
27:01;27:03;"Post-music."
27:03;27:05;"--was when we were making Neo Yokio."
27:05;27:08;"So what is this, around 2014 or '15?"
27:08;27:10;"-And Jaden-- -Something like that."
27:10;27:12;"Jaden Smith would do all of his records."
27:12;27:15;"He'd always have a bag of something from Erewhon."
27:15;27:16;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
27:16;27:19;"'Cause Jaden was the king of the Calabasas Erewhon."
27:19;27:23;"And it's interesting to think, too, that the original Erewhon is in L.A.,"
27:23;27:26;"but people now, because there's been a Silver Lake Erewhon for a few years,"
27:26;27:31;"Silver Lake being famously described as kind of, like, a hipster,"
27:31;27:33;"bougie, new-school-bougie location,"
27:33;27:36;"people think, ""Oh, yeah, Silver Lake Erewhon makes so much sense."""
27:36;27:38;"But years before there was a Silver Lake Erewhon,"
27:38;27:41;"there was a Calabasas Erewhon."
27:41;27:45;"So before you had your little indie rockers,"
27:45;27:49;"indie filmmakers, and whoever going to Erewhon,"
27:49;27:53;"you had Jaden, probably Drake,"
27:53;27:54;"probably the Kardashians,"
27:54;27:59;"probably Kanye hitting the Silver-- the Calabasas Erewhon."
27:59;28:02;"Yeah, so that private equity guy, in a way,"
28:02;28:05;"he was betting on Kanye, Kim, and Jaden"
28:05;28:08;"and saying goodbye to television and talking heads."
28:08;28:10;"I mean, you know, when you put it that way,"
28:10;28:13;"not a difficult choice from a money point of view."
28:13;28:14;"[laughs]"
28:14;28:17;"I'm thinking about his PowerPoint presentation."
28:17;28:21;"He's like, ""Say goodbye to Annie Hall and Marquee Moon."""
28:21;28:22;"[laughter]"
28:22;28:24;"""Say hello to Yeezus."""
28:24;28:25;"[laughter]"
28:25;28:28;"So does the group sex by the Circle Jerks--"
28:28;28:31;"The rest of the board being like, ""What the f*** is this guy talking about?"""
28:31;28:34;"I'm trying to think of albums-- I'm trying to find albums that came out in '80,"
28:34;28:35;"and it does surprise me."
28:35;28:36;"So Circle Jerks--"
28:37;28:38;"No, Circle Jerks were not hitting Erewhon."
28:38;28:40;"With all due respect, Mark,"
28:40;28:41;"you're a music guy."
28:41;28:43;"I'm sure you respect it,"
28:43;28:45;"but when's the last time you really threw on Marquee Moon?"
28:45;28:50;"When's the last time you even listened to the title track all the way through?"
28:50;28:51;"It's a great point, Ted."
28:51;28:55;"I mean, television, absolutely legends, influential,"
28:55;28:58;"but I'm not investing $350 million in them."
28:58;28:59;"Exactly."
28:59;29:03;"You're in the car listening to my beautiful, dark, twisted fantasy by Kanye."
29:03;29:06;"Where does that fall on your albums of all time?"
29:06;29:08;"Actually, that's number one for me."
29:08;29:09;"Ted, look at that, man."
29:09;29:12;"You're a 45-year-old man, you got a Kanye album"
29:12;29:13;"as your number one album of all time."
29:13;29:14;"That says something."
29:14;29:16;"Let's invest in Erewhon."
29:16;29:18;"That screams $20 green juice."
29:18;29:21;"$20 green juice."
29:21;29:24;"Just crying your eyes out, listening to ""Runaway"" by Kanye,"
29:24;29:27;"chugging a $20 green juice."
29:27;29:28;"This is the future."

30:39;30:42;"That's why it has this slight alternate universe feel."
30:42;30:43;"-I dig it. -What about this?"
30:43;30:45;"What about sort of this vision?"
30:45;30:49;"Is that this woman, this Japanese immigrant,"
30:49;30:51;"started this health food company"
30:51;30:55;"based on her macrobiotic diet and Taoist religion."
30:55;30:57;"She goes, ""You know what? Brookline's not right."

31:04;31:07;"And she moves to Hollywood, and she opens this place,"

31:09;31:11;"It's Motley Crue. It's X."
31:11;31:14;"It's the Circle Jerks, and she's in there,"

31:16;31:20;"""Holy s--t. This was not my vision of California."""
31:20;31:21;"'Cause that is what she's walking into."
31:21;31:23;"She's like, ""Where's Joanie, man?"""
31:23;31:24;"I guess that's what's funny."
31:24;31:26;"You had all those things at the same time."
31:26;31:29;"Were we getting a young Flea and Anthony Kiedis"
31:29;31:32;"walking into the first L.A. location of Erewhon?"
31:32;31:35;"You probably had a mixture of, like,"
31:35;31:39;"aging Hollywood hippies, young punk rockers."
31:39;31:41;"Yeah, you could even picture some, like, really old Hollywood."
31:41;31:43;"You could picture some, like, you know,"
31:43;31:47;"maybe Milton Berle, like, rolling in there for--"
31:47;31:49;"'Cause he's like, ""Ah, my doctor tells me I gotta--"
31:49;31:51;"I gotta eat this health food s--t."""
31:51;31:53;"You know, you probably got all sorts of people at that one."
31:53;31:54;"That'd be a funny time machine, like,"
31:54;31:58;"go back and, like, work a shift at the first Erewhon,"
31:58;32:00;"like, within its first year of existence,"
32:00;32:02;"just for the people watching. Who's coming in?"
32:02;32:05;"Hey, for what it's worth, mid-pandemic,"
32:05;32:08;"I saw Jeremy Piven in Erewhon,"
32:08;32:11;"mask fully off his face, flirting."
32:11;32:13;"Anyway, I don't know if I should get too deep into this,"
32:13;32:15;"but he was making a scene."
32:15;32:17;"-No, please get deep into it. -Oh, he's making a scene?"
32:17;32:19;"-Well, here's the thing. -What was the scene?"
32:19;32:21;"Okay, I heard him before I saw him,"
32:21;32:25;"so there was a very loud person multiple aisles down."
32:25;32:29;"-Is this '20 or '21? -This would have been early '20."
32:29;32:31;"-Oh, okay. -So I'm like,"
32:31;32:33;"-there's a spectacle happening. -Early pan."
32:33;32:34;"Early pan, mid pan."
32:34;32:36;"So I crane, I crane my neck,"
32:36;32:38;"and over in the produce, and you know that,"
32:38;32:40;"you know that Silver Lake one is very tight,"
32:40;32:43;"and his mask is fully off his face,"
32:43;32:46;"and it's Jeremy Piven, and he's holding court."
32:46;32:47;"I'm talking like he's talking to, like,"
32:47;32:49;"two, three different people, like, people are, like,"
32:50;32:52;"spotting him, and he's, like, stopping a conversation,"
32:52;32:53;"saying hi to somebody else."
32:53;32:55;"It was very Ari Gold,"
32:55;32:57;"and I will keep that memory with me forever."
32:57;33:01;"Oh, so he was making a scene in, like, a positive way?"
33:01;33:03;"Yeah, he was holding-- he was very gregarious."
33:03;33:05;"It was spectacular in the literal sense."
33:05;33:07;"It was a positive scene, for sure."
33:07;33:09;"Oh, I thought you were going to tell me it was him just going off."
33:09;33:11;"He's like, ""$20 for a [bleep] green juice?"
33:11;33:13;"Are you [bleep] kidding me?"""
33:13;33:15;"And they're like, ""Sir, what did you expect?"""
33:15;33:17;"No, no, no. It was a social--"
33:17;33:20;"It was a warm social moment, a lot of interaction."
33:20;33:21;"That's all I'm saying."
33:21;33:22;"That's the modern Erewhon."
33:22;33:24;"1980? Who knows?"
33:24;33:29;"You may have actually been getting a mix of young punk rockers,"
33:29;33:31;"Cary Grant, Charlton Heston."
33:31;33:35;"I'm actually sent a photo from, like, a stock image site"
33:35;33:38;"of Jeremy Piven at Erewhon."
33:38;33:43;"Just consuming, like, going deep on some pasta."
33:43;33:44;"He's, like, eating outside of Erewhon."
33:44;33:46;"This might have been the time that I saw him, actually."
33:46;33:48;"I didn't know there was a photo op involved."
33:48;33:51;"Amazing. Well, anyway, this is all to say"
33:51;33:53;"I've enjoyed this long tangent,"
33:53;33:55;"because I really think there is something here."
33:55;33:58;"The declining fortunes of Dean and DeLuca,"
33:58;34:00;"the rising fortunes of Erewhon,"
34:00;34:02;"and what it says about America."
34:02;34:03;"That could be an airport book."
34:03;34:05;"I just want to remind, do you know the question"
34:05;34:07;"that got us on this 40-minute tangent?"
34:07;34:09;"-What time is it? -Well, I know about Tully's."
34:09;34:11;"Do you know Tully's?"
34:11;34:12;"Yeah, do you know Tully's?"
34:12;34:14;"So, anyway, Tully's."
34:14;34:16;"That's what I wanted to talk about,"
34:16;34:21;"because Tully's is very ubiquitous,"
34:21;34:23;"from what I can tell, here in Japan,"
34:23;34:26;"or at least the places that I've spent time."
34:26;34:28;"And it's one of those things where, you know,"
34:28;34:32;"you see the name T-U-L-L-Y apostrophe S,"
34:32;34:33;"and you're like, ""It sounds American."""
34:33;34:37;"But then, you know, also one of the giant chains here"
34:37;34:41;"is called Lawson's, which, it's a convenience store,"
34:41;34:44;"and it has a slightly, like, Western,"
34:44;34:45;"wild Western font, and you're just like,"
34:45;34:47;"""Wait, what is this place? Is it Japanese?"
34:47;34:49;"I don't even know."""
34:49;34:52;"But so Tully's, there's a lot of Tully's cafes,"
34:52;34:55;"and even in the famous Japanese vending machines,"
34:55;34:57;"which have a lot of cans of coffee,"
34:57;35:01;"which I love, and you have your Japanese companies,"
35:01;35:03;"like Coffee Boss."
35:03;35:06;"But then I increasingly found myself,"
35:06;35:09;"because I tend to drink black coffee,"
35:09;35:11;"not because I don't love milk and sugar,"
35:11;35:13;"but, you know, just 'cause I'm trying to limit"
35:13;35:15;"the milk and sugar, so sometimes I'm scanning the thing,"
35:15;35:17;"just seeing, like, ""Wait, which one is just plain black?"""
35:17;35:20;"And there's this one, Tully's Barista's Black,"
35:20;35:26;"that's a can, or, like, a metal bottle of just black coffee."
35:26;35:28;"And it tastes good, and it became, like,"
35:28;35:30;"it's become my, like, go-to in the vending machines."
35:30;35:31;"So at some point, I just started thinking, like,"
35:31;35:33;"""Wait, what is Tully's? Is it..."
35:33;35:36;"Do I know it?"" It weirdly rings a bell."
35:36;35:39;"And then I started walking past the cafes more,"
35:39;35:40;"and I sent you guys a picture"
35:40;35:42;"where I'm just kind of looking at their menu,"
35:42;35:43;"'cause one thing I've noticed"
35:43;35:46;"about some of these Japanese coffee chains"
35:46;35:49;"is that they'll go one step further with the food"
35:49;35:51;"than, say, a Starbucks would in the U.S."
35:51;35:55;"So picture your typical kind of small coffee shop."
35:55;35:58;"Like, a lot of people do go to these places for lunch,"
35:58;36:01;"these chain coffee places, even in the U.S.,"
36:01;36:04;"but you're gonna expect to get a sandwich, mostly,"
36:04;36:07;"maybe some snacks, maybe some kind of pre-made salad."
36:07;36:09;"But I've noticed that some of these"
36:09;36:11;"comparable coffee chains in Japan,"
36:11;36:14;"you'll see them advertising, like, ""Spaghetti lunch set."""
36:14;36:16;"You know, just, like, picture going into, like, a Starbucks,"
36:16;36:17;"and they have, like, a spaghetti lunch set."
36:17;36:19;"Pass."
36:19;36:21;"It would require a bit more kitchen space, maybe,"
36:21;36:23;"or... I don't know."
36:23;36:25;"So at Tully's, they weirdly have, like, a..."
36:25;36:28;"kind of a big menu, and what caught my eye last week,"
36:28;36:30;"which got me thinking more deeply about Tully's,"
36:30;36:34;"was a big sign out front that said,"
36:34;36:36;"""Clam chowder hot dog."""
36:36;36:38;"And I looked a little closely at the picture,"
36:38;36:41;"and it really was just a hot dog in a bun"
36:41;36:43;"with clam chowder on the top."
36:43;36:44;"I was really struck by that."
36:44;36:47;"You know, I sent it to you guys, I sent it to a few people."
36:47;36:50;"Everybody found it disgusting."
36:50;36:51;"I haven't tried it yet."
36:51;36:53;"I mean, I don't think it would actually be that bad to eat,"
36:53;36:55;"but it's a strange combination."
36:55;36:58;"And then I was thinking, like, ""Wait, what is Tully's?"""
36:58;37:01;"And then I started looking it up, and Tully's is, actually,"
37:01;37:04;"an American chain, and it's one of these kind of zombie chains."
37:04;37:06;"Maybe it's not fair to say zombie,"
37:06;37:10;"but it's a chain that lives on in Japan,"
37:10;37:12;"and yet it's an American brand"
37:12;37:14;"that doesn't exist in America anymore."
37:14;37:16;"-I've hit it. -You've hit a Tully's..."
37:16;37:19;"Yeah, because I lived in the Pacific Northwest"
37:19;37:23;"late 20th century, early 21st century."
37:23;37:26;"Yeah, late 20th century, man."
37:26;37:27;"So, yeah, I'm familiar with Tully's."
37:27;37:28;"When you sent the photos,"
37:28;37:30;"late 20th century in the Pacific Northwest,"
37:30;37:34;"you'd see Starbucks, you'd see Pete's,"
37:34;37:38;"you'd see Seattle's Best, you'd see Tully's."
37:38;37:39;"Wouldn't see a Dunkin'."
37:39;37:40;"-Yeah. -Right."
37:40;37:43;"-Yeah, that was not Dunkin' country. -No."
37:43;37:47;"This is an age of machinery"
37:47;37:50;"A mechanical nightmare"
37:50;37:53;"The wonderful world of technology"
37:53;37:58;"Named after the form biological"
37:58;38:03;"This is the 20th century"
38:03;38:07;"Not too much at provision"
38:07;38:10;"It's the age of insanity"
38:10;38:12;"What has become of the green"
38:12;38:15;"Beds and fields of Jerusalem?"
38:15;38:20;"Ain't got no ambition"
38:20;38:23;"I'm just disillusioned"
38:23;38:26;"I'm a 20th century man"
38:26;38:28;"But I don't want home"
38:28;38:30;"I don't wanna be alone"
38:30;38:32;"It's funny how, you know,"
38:32;38:35;"last time we were talking about Alice in Chains,"
38:35;38:38;"who are often considered one of the big four"
38:38;38:39;"of Seattle grunge,"
38:39;38:42;"Nirvana and Pearl Jam, obviously up top,"
38:42;38:46;"and then not all that far behind Soundgarden, Alice in Chains."
38:46;38:48;"Those are the big four Seattle grunge bands."
38:48;38:52;"I mean, this is another example of, like, a chain kind of, like,"
38:52;38:55;"rising to prominence along with the music scene."
38:55;38:56;"Think about the fact that we could--"
38:56;38:58;"There's probably also, like, a big four"
38:58;39:01;"of Washington State coffee chains"
39:01;39:03;"that didn't start in the grunge era,"
39:03;39:05;"but rose to prominence."
39:05;39:07;"Starbucks is obviously the Pearl Jam."
39:07;39:08;"Or is it the Nirvana?"
39:08;39:11;"Which is the Nirvana? That gets hard to say."
39:11;39:13;"That's Longevity. So it's the Pearl Jam."
39:13;39:15;"Yeah, still kicking."
39:15;39:17;"But maybe Tully's is the Alice in Chains."
39:17;39:19;"So Tully's was founded in 1992"
39:19;39:23;"by Tom ""Tully"" O'Keefe in Seattle, Washington."
39:23;39:26;"O'Keefe originally planned to rival Starbucks,"
39:26;39:28;"but refocused its approach to the Seattle area,"
39:29;39:31;"specifically the Puget Sound region."
39:31;39:34;"-Puget. -Oh, Puget. Thank you."
39:34;39:37;"Eventually, they'd expand into California, Idaho, and Arizona,"
39:37;39:42;"and then they licensed the brand for use in South Korea and Japan."
39:42;39:47;"There were some stores in Singapore, Manila, Beijing, all over the world."
39:47;39:50;"But eventually, Tully's sold its North American wholesale"
39:50;39:53;"coffee bean distribution to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters,"
39:53;39:57;"which is, I think, eventually became part of the same giant company"
39:57;39:59;"that does Keurig and Dr. Pepper."
39:59;40:01;"-OK. -Has all these things."
40:01;40:03;"Just increasingly huge companies buy all these things."
40:03;40:07;"There's something particularly funny about the fate of Tully's to me,"
40:07;40:10;"because it's a guy's name."
40:10;40:15;"It's a dude. It's just like a local dude in Seattle in '92,"
40:15;40:17;"the year that Dirt came out."
40:17;40:18;"[laughs]"
40:18;40:21;"-Probably blasting Dirt. -Epic year."
40:21;40:24;"Yes, you really could make the case. Tully's and Dirt."
40:24;40:26;"Marky Moon and Dean and DeLuca."
40:26;40:30;"I think it's also worth mentioning that Dirt got the famed TC bump last week,"
40:30;40:34;"because it re-entered the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart."
40:34;40:36;"-Yes. -That's got to be because of our episode."
40:36;40:40;"I mean, there were so many people listening who went out and had a Dirt night."
40:40;40:42;"And the thing about throwing a Dirt night is,"
40:42;40:46;"you invite a few buddies over for a Dirt night, you listen to Dirt,"
40:46;40:50;"well, they're going to go home and want to listen to Dirt again with their family."
40:50;40:52;"Now maybe their kids are listening to Dirt."
40:52;40:56;"Maybe the kids are at school the next day saying,"
40:56;40:57;"""Hey, have you guys ever had a Dirt night?"""
40:57;40:59;"And the other kid's saying, ""What's Dirt night?"""
40:59;41:01;"""Well, it's when you throw on the Alice in Chains album Dirt."""
41:01;41:04;"""Hold on, Alice in Chains? I don't know what you're talking about."""
41:04;41:05;"""Wow, you got some listening to."""
41:05;41:07;"Now these kids are going home listening to Dirt."
41:07;41:11;"So anyway, for every one person who listened to that episode of Time Crisis,"
41:11;41:14;"I think it's fair to say that 200 to 300 other people"
41:14;41:19;"ended up listening to Dirt within four or five days."
41:19;41:21;"Listening and buying the album."
41:21;41:26;"Time Crisis talks about Alice in Chains' Dirt within a week."
41:26;41:30;"You have an 11-year-old in Wichita, Kansas,"
41:30;41:34;"buying a 180-gram vinyl pressing of the album."
41:34;41:39;"And his dad, who works at the corporate headquarters of Dean & DeLuca,"
41:39;41:41;"has a nice walk down memory lane."
41:41;41:42;"That's right."
41:42;41:46;"But yeah, there's something so funny to me about Tully's just being like a dude's name."
41:46;41:49;"Because it's one thing, I guess it's kind of similar to McDonald's,"
41:49;41:53;"but it's one thing to be like, ""Oh yeah, that brand which, you know,"
41:53;41:57;"somebody started in the '60s, got bought and sold and bought and sold,"
41:57;42:02;"and now it's part of a portfolio from some giant anonymous company,"
42:02;42:04;"and it's so disconnected from its roots."""
42:04;42:08;"But it's particularly funny and weird when it's somebody's name."
42:08;42:11;"Just like this dude gave his name to this company,"
42:11;42:17;"and now through all the ups and downs of global finance"
42:17;42:19;"and branding and marketing and licensing,"
42:19;42:22;"they're selling clam chowder hot dogs."
42:22;42:23;"Yeah, yeah."
42:23;42:26;"When I started researching and I was thinking about the clam chowder hot dog,"
42:26;42:29;"I just really wished I could call, I don't know if he's alive,"
42:29;42:32;"but call Tom ""Tully"" O'Keefe and just be like,"
42:32;42:36;"""Man, back in '92, you're sitting there in Seattle blasting dirt."
42:36;42:39;"Did you ever think that 30 years later,"
42:39;42:44;"somebody might be chowing down on a clam chowder hot dog in Kyoto"
42:44;42:46;"and saying your name out loud?"""
42:46;42:47;"And he'd just be like..."
42:47;42:49;"-Yes. -Life is pretty weird, man."
42:49;42:54;"I also wonder, too, with the clam chowder hot dog,"
42:54;42:59;"I'd love to talk to somebody who works at the test kitchen of Japanese Tully's."
42:59;43:00;"I wonder if..."
43:00;43:03;"I mean, clam chowder is not a Japanese thing."
43:03;43:06;"Clam chowder is an American thing."
43:06;43:07;"They eat clams, they eat soup."
43:07;43:10;"But I wonder if there was somebody who was like,"
43:10;43:12;"""Yeah, clam chowder, it's kind of American."
43:12;43:15;"Hot dogs are American. Put them together."
43:15;43:16;"It's like a special American thing."""
43:16;43:19;"And then again, I know it's a two-way street."
43:19;43:20;"Then I start to think about,"
43:20;43:24;"I wonder if Panda Express ever does some special thing"
43:24;43:29;"where they throw together two seemingly Chinese flavors into an American."
43:29;43:32;"They're like, ""That totally makes sense. Why wouldn't you?"""
43:32;43:34;"And a Chinese person would just be like, ""What?"""
43:34;43:36;"It's a loss in translation."
43:36;43:39;"You got to try that clam chowder hot dog, dude."
43:39;43:40;"Yeah, I guess I will."
43:40;43:45;"I'm finding a lot of recipes online for clam chowder hot dogs."
43:45;43:47;"It does feel like this idea..."
43:47;43:49;"Look, there are no new ideas,"
43:49;43:53;"but this one did sound pretty novel."
43:53;43:55;"But it does seem..."
43:55;43:56;"This one's crazy."
43:56;44:01;"This one from a blog called The Food in My Beard,"
44:01;44:02;"which is so gross."
44:02;44:05;"This blog starts off, and this is great."
44:05;44:07;"It goes, ""I saw my friend, the vulgar chef,"
44:07;44:09;"dip a hot dog in a cup of clam chowder,"
44:09;44:11;"and honestly, it changed my life."
44:11;44:14;"I made these right after I saw it."""
44:14;44:16;"So that's an interesting origin story."
44:17;44:19;"But it does feel, when I look at the rest of them, too, there's a lot."
44:19;44:23;"I mean, this is a palette or a combo"
44:23;44:26;"that has occurred to a lot of people."
44:26;44:28;"Pillsbury.com..."
44:28;44:31;"Oh, no, they have a creamy corn hot dog chowder."
44:31;44:32;"Oh, where the hot dogs are in the chowder."
44:32;44:34;"Yes, this is a different one."
44:34;44:36;"One way of thinking about it is,"
44:36;44:40;"imagine it's a cold New England day."
44:40;44:44;"You're in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
44:44;44:48;"You've been working down at the dockyards."
44:48;44:51;"Maybe you've been out on a whaling ship,"
44:51;44:53;"a commercial vessel."
44:53;44:55;"You're just cold as hell."
44:55;44:57;"Just the chill has gotten into your bones."
44:57;44:58;"You're damp."
44:58;45:00;"You're freezing."
45:00;45:02;"It's a gray New England day."
45:02;45:04;"You come back to shore,"
45:04;45:09;"walk in to a little shack by the dockyards,"
45:09;45:13;"and someone's cooking up a nice, big, hot cauldron"
45:13;45:16;"of New England clam chowder."
45:16;45:17;"Hot, creamy clam chowder."
45:17;45:20;"You walk in, the smell is just amazing."
45:20;45:22;"Oh, you're so cold, you're so wet."
45:22;45:24;"Smells so good. And then they say, ""You know what else?"
45:24;45:28;"We got some piping hot hot dogs to go along with that."""
45:28;45:32;"You sit down with a hearty bowl of New England clam chowder."
45:32;45:33;"Oh, yeah."
45:33;45:37;"A big, fat, hot hot dog next to you."
45:37;45:40;"You tell me you're not going to dip that hot dog"
45:40;45:43;"into that New England clam chowder and just go to town?"
45:43;45:45;"Well, you're doing it. You're star--"
45:45;45:46;"You're starving, dude."
45:46;45:49;"You have a crisp IPA with you."
45:49;45:51;"-You're going to town. -Is this considered a--"
45:51;45:54;"Is that a fully loaded hot dog? Is it fully loaded?"
45:54;45:57;"I think once you get into the seafood category,"
45:57;46:01;"a fully loaded seafood hot dog would have to have more than clam chowder."
46:01;46:03;"I want to see some shrimp."
46:03;46:04;"[laughs]"
46:04;46:07;"I want to see maybe some little chunks of lobster."
46:07;46:09;"Some scallops."
46:09;46:10;"-Some scallops? -Some haddock."
46:10;46:12;"I think we're going to need to get more of a mix."
46:12;46:13;"I mean, and also when you think about it,"
46:13;46:15;"speaking of New England, a lobster roll"
46:15;46:19;"is just lobster chunks in a hot dog bun."
46:19;46:22;"It's not crazy, a clam chowder hot dog."
46:22;46:23;"-Yeah. -For all I know,"
46:23;46:26;"the people in the Japanese test kitchen were--"
46:26;46:28;"They were just checking out the Food and My Beard blog"
46:28;46:31;"to see what American amateur chefs are up to,"
46:31;46:33;"and they got the idea."
46:33;46:37;"But either way, I doubt that this New England combination"
46:37;46:40;"would particularly speak to Tom Tully O'Keefe."

47:32;47:37;"and just a reminder of how strange these brand acquisitions are,"
47:37;47:42;"at some point, you know, the original Tully, Tom Tully O'Keefe,"
47:42;47:45;"had nothing to do with the company anymore."
47:45;47:49;"They'd filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012."
47:49;47:52;"And then Global Baristas,"
47:52;47:56;"an investment group led by actor Patrick Dempsey,"
47:56;48:00;"bought Tully's via bankruptcy auction."
48:00;48:02;"So it's this weird thing where,"
48:02;48:04;"yeah, the actor Patrick Dempsey,"
48:04;48:06;"I mean, we should get him on the show sometime."
48:06;48:07;"- I wonder how often-- - McDreamy."
48:07;48:10;"Yeah, McDreamy. He was on Grey's Anatomy."
48:10;48:13;"He's been acting since he-- I think he was even a child actor."
48:13;48:16;"He was like a teen heartthrob in the '80s."
48:16;48:19;"He got into the private equity game."
48:19;48:21;"He started a company, Global Baristas."
48:21;48:23;"He bought Tully's,"
48:23;48:26;"but then he eventually backed out of the partnership"
48:26;48:29;"and sued his partner at Global Baristas,"
48:29;48:31;"who was Patrick Dempsey's partner at Global Baristas,"
48:31;48:34;"none other than, I believe,"
48:34;48:38;"currently imprisoned lawyer Michael Avenatti."
48:38;48:41;"Sounds like an awesome company."
48:41;48:43;"And for people who don't know, Michael Avenatti,"
48:43;48:46;"what's he-- he's in prison for something about Nike."
48:46;48:48;"Remember, he was Stormy Daniels' attorney."
48:48;48:51;"He became this kind of like resistance icon for a while"
48:51;48:54;"all over MSNBC and CNN."
48:54;48:55;"He was like, ""We're gonna take down Trump."""
48:55;48:56;"There are people even saying,"
48:56;48:59;"""Oh, this guy could be the next president."""
48:59;49:00;"Anyway, he played a role--"
49:00;49:02;"Wild, he's in prison."
49:02;49:03;"Currently in prison."
49:03;49:05;"That's wild."
49:05;49:07;"He's in prison for 48 months"
49:07;49:09;"for fraud and aggravated identity theft."
49:09;49:10;"Yikes."
49:10;49:12;"Aggravated identity theft?"
49:12;49:13;"Yeah, it was aggravated."
49:13;49:15;"-Aggravated. -So who's the current--"
49:15;49:16;"[laughter]"
49:16;49:18;"Who's the current head of--"
49:18;49:21;"So both Dempsey and Avenatti out,"
49:21;49:23;"who's the current head of--"
49:23;49:25;"I don't know what happened to Global Baristas."
49:25;49:26;"-Captain LeShip. -I don't think they--"
49:26;49:28;"♪ Global Baristas ♪"
49:28;49:29;"[laughter]"
49:29;49:32;"I don't think Global Baristas has anything to do"
49:32;49:35;"-with Tully's anymore. -Oh, man."
49:35;49:38;"And Tully's Japan, I think, just kind of has its own thing going."
49:38;49:41;"But it seems like they're doing a great job"
49:41;49:43;"because you see the coffee everywhere."
49:43;49:45;"I mean, you see the chain everywhere,"
49:45;49:49;"but you also see the coffee in convenience stores and machines."
49:49;49:51;"-And it's really good. -Wow."
49:51;49:53;"But anyway, yeah, I could--"
49:53;49:57;"The journey from 1992 Seattle to clam chowder,"
49:57;49:59;"hot dogs in Kyoto."
49:59;50:02;"I mean, that's just the story of our world, really."
50:02;50:03;"That's your airport book."
50:03;50:05;"That's my-- Yeah."
50:05;50:06;"[laughter]"
50:06;50:09;"Ezra, are you still planning on doing any traveling"
50:09;50:12;"around Japan while you're still there?"
50:12;50:14;"Yeah, I'm sure I'll be doing a bit of traveling."
50:14;50:18;"Well, Tully's has just announced"
50:18;50:21;"that they're going to have eight region-limited drinks"
50:21;50:22;"that have gone up."
50:22;50:26;"They did a nationwide or regional election,"
50:26;50:30;"and each region elected a different coffee drink"
50:30;50:31;"that will be local."
50:31;50:34;"So if you, for example, were to find yourself"
50:34;50:37;"in Shikoku area,"
50:37;50:41;"you could get a pink salt and double nut latte, which--"
50:41;50:42;"-Latte. -Yup."
50:42;50:46;"And these, they're all very different."
50:46;50:48;"The Tokyo region special latte is kind of boring."
50:48;50:52;"Vanilla Kaoru creme brulee."
50:52;50:53;"I guess creme brulee is kind of interesting."
50:53;50:55;"Hokkaido one, it's only in Hokkaido."
50:55;50:58;"You get this Hobaru peanuts"
50:58;51:00;"that's described as the name of the cafe--"
51:00;51:04;"The name of the coffee translates to lots of peanuts,"
51:04;51:05;"and that's what it is."
51:05;51:08;"It's also topped with roasted peanuts."
51:08;51:11;"So it's a peanut drink topped with roasted peanuts."
51:11;51:12;"It's fully loaded."
51:12;51:13;"I'm not mad at that."
51:13;51:15;"A fully loaded latte."
51:15;51:18;"So I think as you go, if you do plan on doing some traveling,"
51:18;51:19;"you should try to hit these up, see if you can--"
51:19;51:21;"Wait, last question."
51:21;51:22;"Can somebody get me a number crunch?"
51:22;51:25;"How many Tully's are there in Japan?"
51:25;51:27;"And if I dedicate the rest of my time in Japan"
51:27;51:29;"to hitting all of them,"
51:29;51:33;"could I feasibly become the winter of Japanese Tully's?"
51:33;51:35;"How many are there?"
51:35;51:36;"Tully-bucking."
51:36;51:37;"-Tully-bucking. -I don't think you're gonna be able"
51:37;51:39;"to pull that off, dude."
51:39;51:42;"Well, I will say it's the 25th anniversary of Tully's."
51:42;51:45;"So it's been there for 25 years in Japan."
51:45;51:46;"25 years in Japan."
51:46;51:49;"And I think that that is a noble effort while you're there."
51:49;51:52;"I'm seeing 750 Tully's in Japan."
51:52;51:55;"Oh, my God. What?"
51:55;51:57;"-750 Tully's in Japan? -You better get started."
51:57;52:00;"That's as of November of last year."
52:00;52:02;"-So that might-- -So that's really next level."
52:02;52:04;"That's an uphill battle."
52:04;52:06;"Are there zero Tully's in America"
52:06;52:08;"or there's still some random Tully's hanging on somewhere?"
52:08;52:11;"So when I was looking at Michael Avenatti, actually,"
52:11;52:13;"just to see what he was in for serving time,"
52:13;52:17;"I found a headline five results down that was like--"
52:17;52:19;"The headline was a quote,"
52:19;52:22;"""We are not opening any Tully's."""
52:22;52:25;"It was Avenatti being like, ""No more Tully's in America."""
52:25;52:27;"That was the headline."
52:27;52:29;"So I think it's zero."
52:29;52:30;"Wow. What a career."
52:30;52:33;"Just like-- That just kind of sums it up."
52:33;52:36;"Like a dude five years earlier is just out there on Bloomberg News"
52:36;52:39;"just being like, ""Listen, folks."
52:39;52:41;"Tully's is ours. We're not opening it anymore."
52:41;52:43;"Sorry if that hurts your feelings."""
52:43;52:44;"But we're done. And then five years later,"
52:44;52:48;"""Donald Trump is a dangerous man. He's going down."""
52:48;52:52;"Just like bringing that exact same energy"
52:52;52:55;"from global baristas to politics."
52:55;52:58;"The way that Tully's got to Japan"
52:58;53:00;"is that in 1997,"
53:00;53:06;"a Sanwa Bank employee named Koto Matsuda"
53:06;53:09;"personally went to Tom O'Keefe and said,"
53:09;53:15;"""We really need some high-end coffee shops in Japan."""
53:15;53:17;"And so O'Keefe listened"
53:18;53:23;"and then made Matsuda the CEO of all of Tully's."
53:23;53:24;"-Of Tully's Coffee Japan. -Yeah."
53:24;53:27;"So this fan, this Java head said,"
53:27;53:29;"""I need you to bring something here."""
53:29;53:32;"He said, ""You know what? You run it."""
53:32;53:33;"I don't know. It seems like a great story."
53:33;53:36;"No, it is. And also, unlike Starbucks,"
53:36;53:37;"who run their overseas operations,"
53:37;53:40;"Tully's expanded in Japan through franchising."
53:40;53:45;"And I appreciate that because then you're giving local people in Japan"
53:45;53:47;"a real piece of the action."
53:47;53:48;"And I think that's the way to do it."
53:48;53:50;"And $750, that's no joke."
53:50;53:51;"That's a real success story."

55:58;56:00;"Yep, I'm excited."
56:00;56:04;"Second grade's been your favorite new band for a minute, right?"
56:04;56:05;"Yeah."
56:05;56:06;"When did they cross your radar?"
56:06;56:07;"2020."
56:07;56:11;"I got into their album Hit to Hit, which was their second album."
56:11;56:16;"They just put out their third album, Easy Listening, a few weeks ago."
56:16;56:19;"I've listened to their three albums a lot."
56:19;56:21;"In terms of bands who are youngish,"
56:21;56:25;"who are kind of underdogs that I'm rooting for,"
56:25;56:27;"second grade is my favorite band, for sure."
56:27;56:29;"Have you listened to them at all?"
56:29;56:32;"Yeah, I was checking them out when you said they're going to be on the show."
56:32;56:35;"Great vibe, real ear, great melodies."
56:35;56:37;"Yeah, great songwriting."
56:37;56:39;"It has that vibe of like when you..."
56:39;56:42;"It kind of like all three of their records have that vibe of like"
56:42;56:44;"you just started a band with your friends"
56:44;56:48;"and you have like the band's going in like nine different directions at once"
56:48;56:50;"and you have a lot of ideas"
56:50;56:54;"and you're just like having fun recording quickly"
56:54;56:55;"and you're doing it well."
56:55;56:57;"I don't know. I love the band."
56:57;57:01;"Their new album has a song called Kramer in L.A.,"
57:01;57:05;"which Seinfeld, you were introduced to recently."
57:05;57:08;"They're hitting a lot of parts of the TC universe."
57:08;57:11;"Seinfeld, what did you think when you heard Kramer in L.A.?"
57:11;57:13;"I mean, I was instantly hooked."
57:13;57:16;"I was listening to it on repeat earlier today."
57:16;57:19;"It's a song, I think, that captures the energy"
57:19;57:22;"and the pathos of that two-part episode, The Trip."
57:22;57:24;"So, yeah, I'm excited."
57:24;57:28;"It's like if Chet Baker was a Seinfeld fan or something."
57:28;57:29;"Yes."
57:29;57:31;"Love that."
57:31;57:33;"All right, well, let's get Peter on the phone."
57:33;57:34;"Yeah."
57:34;57:37;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
57:37;57:40;"[phone ringing]"
57:40;57:42;"Hello."
57:42;57:43;"Peter."
57:43;57:45;"Peter, what's up?"
57:45;57:47;"What's going on, everyone?"
57:47;57:50;"Welcome to Time Crisis. Thanks for being on."
57:50;57:52;"Thanks. It's an honor to be here."
57:52;57:53;"Thank you for having me."
57:53;57:57;"We were just talking about Seinfeld or Kramer in L.A."
57:57;57:59;"We were just saying, like, it's kind of like, you know,"
57:59;58:02;"if Chet Baker was a Seinfeld fan or something."
58:02;58:03;"[laughs]"
58:03;58:06;"That's what I was going for. Yeah, totally."
58:06;58:08;"[laughs]"
58:08;58:10;"Where are you calling from? Are you in Philadelphia?"
58:10;58:13;"Yeah, I'm calling from Philly here."
58:13;58:14;"I'm dog-sitting at the moment,"
58:14;58:18;"so I'm hanging out with this cool guy, Marlo."
58:18;58:19;"Oh, hell yeah."
58:19;58:20;"Oh, hey, what's up, Marlo?"
58:20;58:22;"Yeah, he's a chiller."
58:22;58:23;"[laughs]"
58:23;58:24;"Good boy."
58:24;58:27;"Well, actually, one question I wanted to ask is,"
58:27;58:29;"you guys are a Philly band."
58:29;58:33;"Are you and everybody from the Philly area?"
58:33;58:37;"So we all, like, come from different places originally,"
58:37;58:40;"kind of all over, like, the Northeast and East Coast."
58:40;58:42;"I'm from Maine myself."
58:42;58:46;"And we all, like, kind of converged in Philly"
58:46;58:48;"over the last few years or so,"
58:48;58:50;"and everyone lives there now."
58:50;58:53;"And did you move to Philly to, like, be in bands?"
58:53;58:55;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
58:55;58:57;"I play in this other band that's called Friendship."
58:57;59:00;"It's kind of like a country-ish kind of band."
59:00;59:03;"And Friendship, we formed up in Maine"
59:03;59:05;"on this little island off the coast"
59:05;59:07;"called Little Cranberry."
59:07;59:09;"Yeah, we were, like, doing music up there"
59:09;59:12;"and decided that we were going to move to Philly."
59:12;59:14;"What's going on on Little Cranberry?"
59:14;59:15;"Is that where you're from?"
59:15;59:18;"I'm not from there, but I lived there for a while."
59:18;59:21;"It's a big lobster-fishing island."
59:21;59:23;"And that's what I was doing up there,"
59:23;59:25;"working on a lobster boat for a while."
59:25;59:29;"Wow. So you probably had some real cold, hard days..."
59:29;59:31;"Yeah. ...out there on that boat."
59:31;59:32;"Oh, for sure."
59:32;59:34;"I see where this is going."
59:34;59:37;"When you get back to shore, what's the ideal meal?"
59:37;59:39;"'Cause sometimes you're getting back to shore,"
59:39;59:41;"I imagine you're cold and wet."
59:41;59:43;"The chill has probably entered your bones, right?"
59:43;59:44;"Mm-hmm."
59:44;59:48;"I would say the ideal, like, the ultimate thing"
59:48;59:51;"that I could look forward to would be"
59:51;59:55;"a nice slice of warm, homemade meatloaf..."
59:55;59:56;"Mm."
59:56;59:58;"...with some mashed potatoes on the side..."
59:58;59:59;"Mm."
59:59;01:00:01;"...and a nice green salad"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"to kind of balance things out there."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"Delicious."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Yeah."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"How much New England clam chowder"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"is being consumed up in Maine?"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"[laughs]"
01:00:11;01:00:14;"Quite a-- I'd say the lion's share of it"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"is being consumed up there, yeah."
01:00:16;01:00:17;"Quite a bit."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"A lot of it's coming out of bread bowls..."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Ah."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"...which is the ideal vessel for such a concoction."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"Part of why I'm asking this is,"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"do you think it's crazy to put New England clam chowder"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"on a hot dog?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"[laughs]"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Um, wow."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"I've never heard of that in my life."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"Okay."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"But now that you're, like, kind of asking me,"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"no, I think that would be pretty good, actually."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"I would try that."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"Okay."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"There you go, somebody with some actual experience"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"being in New England."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"A little bit of backstory..."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Lobsterman."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"...is, uh, Ezra's in Japan right now."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"Mm-hmm."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"And there's a defunct American coffee chain"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"called Tully's"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"that has 750 locations in Japan,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"but they're also running a promo right now"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"of a clam chowder hot dog."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"[laughs]"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Yeah, we were wondering..."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"So that's where we're at in 2020."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"...does that have any roots in--"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Wow."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"On the one hand, yeah,"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"it doesn't actually sound that crazy"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"when you pause to think about it."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"It is unusual."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"But so you've actually had the experience of--"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"'cause then we started talking about, like,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"actually being in New England and, you know,"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"working and a cold, wet job"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"and coming back to shore."
01:01:25;01:01:26;"So you--"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"have you actually had the experience"
01:01:28;01:01:31;"of coming off a hard day's work on the lobster boat"
01:01:31;01:01:34;"and consuming a piping hot, cold"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"New England clam chowder?"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"[laughs]"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"No."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"No, that actually--"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"No?"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"I haven't done that, no,"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"'cause I feel like, uh,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"clam chowder to me seems like"
01:01:45;01:01:48;"something that requires some time to prepare."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"And when I'm coming off the boat,"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"I'm probably just eating--"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"heating up, like, leftovers or something."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"Oh, I guess you could heat up clam chowder, huh?"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"No, I just never, uh--"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"clam chowder wasn't really part of my diet on the island."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Yeah, okay,"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"so you were living on the island at the time,"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"so I imagine there's not too much happening there."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"You get off a hard day's work on the boat,"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"you're going home."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"It's not like there's a--"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"a vibrant Popeye-esque dockyard"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"where there's, like--"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Seaside shanty."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Like, some, like, cool--"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"like, a cool dive bar right there"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"and then some place where there's, like,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"some old man cooking up a big cauldron of clam chowder"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"and you're just like,"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"""Yeah, grab a bowl, 50 cents."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"Rip a hunk of bread."""
01:02:28;01:02:30;"Oh, that sounds awesome."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"That's kind of what I was hoping for"
01:02:32;01:02:33;"when I signed up to do it,"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"and, yeah, it turned out to be nothing like that."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"No vibrant dock scene."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"What is there on--"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"you said it's called Little Cranberry Island?"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Little Cranberry, yeah."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"There's not a whole lot."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"The one main attraction is"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"someone in the restaurant world"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"put in a ton of effort to establish"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"kind of like a fine dining restaurant"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"way out on this island,"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"which is quite an undertaking"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"considering, like, you know, staffing."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Like, who's going to work there?"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"How are you going to get"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"all these nice ingredients out there?"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Right."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"So it's a labor of love"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"and I guess Martha Stewart"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"is a really big fan of this restaurant"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"and takes her private boat there quite a bit"
01:03:14;01:03:19;"to enjoy their famous crab cakes, I guess."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"Yeah."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"So you have one, like,"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"really high-end fine dining restaurant"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"and then, like, a subway?"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"Yeah, there's really no--"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"none of those, like, fast food places"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"or anything out there."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"It's pretty much that one restaurant--"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Same little supermarket."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"And there's, like, a tiny little"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"general store, I guess,"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"that you can, like,"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"pick your mail up at the store"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"and they might have, like,"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"deli sandwiches."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"That's about it, though."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"Is there a single bar,"
01:03:47;01:03:51;"if not a vibrant dockyard bar"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"where sailors get in fights?"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"There's a bar, at least, on Little Cranberry?"
01:03:55;01:03:56;"Yeah, there's a bar"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"that's within that restaurant,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"the dock bar."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"And would you ever play shows there?"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"What's the venue scene like?"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Well, you said you had a band"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"called Friendship."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Yeah."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"I know that band, too."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"Yeah, we did play at the restaurant."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"We did it two times, actually."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"And, yeah, that was pretty fun,"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"actually."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"You know, when you play"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"somewhere like that,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"where there's not a lot of live music"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"or performances happening"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"on a regular basis,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"people get really excited"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"when there's any sort of show."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"And so, basically,"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"the whole island is there"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"to, like, check out this performance."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"The whole island comes out."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"That's sick."

01:06:07;01:06:08;"Lobster fishermen?"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Lobster..."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"What do you say?"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"You say lobster men?"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Lobster fishermen makes no sense."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"Lobster men, yeah."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"One of the others was a lobster man"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"and another was a"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"carpenter's assistant."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"And you didn't know each other"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"prior to..."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"We all knew each other"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"from like high school"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"growing up together"
01:06:27;01:06:28;"and so like we had..."
01:06:28;01:06:29;"On the mainland."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"On the mainland, yeah."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"On the main mainland."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"A much more normal kind of"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"urban place that has your subways"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"and your dominoes."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"That kind of stuff."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"But we..."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"Yeah, so like we knew each other"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"for years but we had all"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"ended up on this island together"
01:06:45;01:06:46;"somehow."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"This is an amazing origin story"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"by the way."
01:06:48;01:06:49;"I just want to say that like"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"what was it like at the time?"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"I mean it sounds so"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"cool and romantic to me"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"to picture being on like some"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"cold ass main island."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"Were you there in the off season"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"or is this in the summer"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"year round?"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"Yeah, year round."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"You spent a dark winter"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"on Little Cranberry."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"I did, yeah."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Yeah, it was really cold."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"There was one point where"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"it snowed a lot"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"and the power lines that"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"power the whole island"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"from the mainland"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"those lines went down"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"and it took them a week"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"to restore power"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"so we didn't have like"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"access to electricity"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"or hot water for a week"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"and that was really a bummer."
01:07:32;01:07:33;"So you're just freezing?"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"We were so cold."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"We had a wood stove"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"but you'd have to like wake up"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"in the middle of the night"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"to like throw more wood on it"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"because otherwise you'd wake up"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"and it'd be freezing cold"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"and like the pipes would"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"all be frozen"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"and you'd have no water."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"That was like near the end"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"of my time there"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"and at that point"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"I think the romance"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"had worn off"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"but I'd say all in all"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"it was a pretty romantic experience."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"Yeah, just being up there"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"on the coast of Maine"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"and like just reading"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"tons of books in our off time"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"because like there's nothing else to do"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"and there's a great radio station"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"up there like a community radio"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"that has a recurring"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Bob Dylan radio show"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"every week"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"and so like we tune into that"
01:08:18;01:08:19;"and I understand"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"we have some Dylan heads"
01:08:21;01:08:23;"in the chat here."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"That's right"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"and they would play like"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"this is just like some crazy"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"Dylan head had their own show"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"and just be going deep"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"bootlegs and live"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"and all that kind of stuff."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"Yeah, exactly"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"and he was like really"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"into playing like a lot"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"of the fan favorite"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"kind of bootlegs"
01:08:38;01:08:39;"that never made it"
01:08:39;01:08:40;"on albums and stuff"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"and so that was like"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"my first time hearing"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"a lot of those songs"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"and I haven't really"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"stopped digging"
01:08:47;01:08:50;"since listening to that show."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"You had a real taste"
01:08:51;01:08:52;"of 20th century living."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"I was going to say"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"and 19th."
01:08:54;01:08:56;"And 19th."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"You had a combination"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"of 19th and..."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"I love that listening"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"to the radio on a cold"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"snowy Maine Island."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"I mean it sounds amazing."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"I'm sure at the time"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"there must have been"
01:09:06;01:09:09;"some low points"
01:09:09;01:09:11;"being really cold."
01:09:11;01:09:12;"Yeah, but I'd say"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"looking back it was"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"it was like the ultimate experience."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Maine is just a special place."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"I've always loved Maine."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Yeah, in my limited time there"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"I always thought"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"that's truly one of the"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"greatest places in America"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"and what was it like"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"actually working on the boat?"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"It was hard."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"Yeah, I kind of got my butt kicked"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"by that job."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"The worst part for me was like"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"so the workflow is like"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"the traps would come up"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"out of the water"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"on this like pulley system"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"and my job was to sort through"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"the trap really quickly"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"to like the lobsters"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"that are like legal"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"of the right size and gender"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"and stuff to be harvested."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Those go in a pile"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"and make sure everything else"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"in the trap gets thrown"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"back in the water."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"And so basically"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"this trap comes up"
01:09:57;01:09:58;"and you have like 20 lobsters"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"that are ready to fight you."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"They all have their claws."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"They're all going like this."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"And you're just like"
01:10:05;01:10:06;"plunging your hand"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"into the seething"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"mass of crustaceans"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"and hoping you're not"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"getting your fingers pinched."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"What kind of gloves"
01:10:14;01:10:15;"are you wearing?"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"I was wearing some"
01:10:17;01:10:18;"like cloth gloves."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"So they had some"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"dexterity to them,"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"but not a ton."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"And how did it feel"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"when the lobsters got you?"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"It hurts a lot."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"And so lobsters have"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"they have two different claws."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"One of them is really fast"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"and sharp and it's called"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"the pincer claw."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"And that's the one"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"that got me a lot."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"And it is like the sharp pain."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"And then their other claw,"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"that's the one you really"
01:10:42;01:10:43;"have to watch out for"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"is the crusher claw."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It's gigantic"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"and it could probably"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"break your finger if it"
01:10:50;01:10:51;"it's a lot slower though."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"Even with these"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"these gloves you're wearing"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"it could break your finger."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"I think it could."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Yeah, I mean,"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"I never really."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"It could f*** you up."
01:10:59;01:11:00;"It could probably really"
01:11:00;01:11:01;"f*** you up."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Yeah, I never gave it the chance."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"I never got the crusher."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"I only got the pincer."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"It's a little like"
01:11:07;01:11:08;"like a, you know,"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"like fighting video games"
01:11:09;01:11:10;"where there's different"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"characters and some of them"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"are like really fast"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"and they do like small"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"amounts of damage."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"And then there's"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"like your Donkey Kong"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"or something that"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"his attack takes five seconds."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"But if it hits you,"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"you're done."
01:11:22;01:11:23;"Something like that."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Right."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"A little more time to prepare."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"You got to get the hell"
01:11:26;01:11:27;"out of there."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"So is it easy to tell"
01:11:28;01:11:29;"a lobster's gender?"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Pretty easy once you know"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"what to look for."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"You got to like flip it over"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"and you're looking for these"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"like two little hard"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"like two little plastic"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"like things that are"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"protruding from the"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"bottom side of it."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"And also like a lot of"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"the females have tons of eggs."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"So that's like a pretty"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"obvious giveaway too."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Because you can see the eggs."
01:11:50;01:11:51;"As you inspected"
01:11:51;01:11:52;"all these crabs,"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"did you ever see"
01:11:53;01:11:54;"one of the famous"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"two-tone crabs?"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"I feel like every few years"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"it goes viral."
01:11:58;01:11:58;"Like a fisherman in Maine"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"found a two-tone crab"
01:12:00;01:12:01;"where like half is blue"
01:12:01;01:12:02;"and half is red or something."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"You know,"
01:12:03;01:12:04;"I never caught one like that."
01:12:04;01:12:06;"But I was in Bar Harbor"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"like on an off day."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"And I was like hanging out"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"near the dock"
01:12:11;01:12:12;"and I overheard"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"some other lobsterman"
01:12:14;01:12:15;"telling his friend like,"
01:12:15;01:12:17;"""Yo, look at this lobster I caught."""
01:12:17;01:12:19;"And so I like talked my way"
01:12:19;01:12:20;"into going down on the dock"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"with them."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"Yeah, they caught this"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"like blue lobster."
01:12:23;01:12:24;"The whole thing was"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"oceanic blue."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"It was pretty cool."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Very rare."
01:12:29;01:12:30;"I bet."
01:12:30;01:12:31;"Doesn't the lobsterman"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"sound like some"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"mid-60s garage band?"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Totally."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"It totally does."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Yeah,"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"some like band from"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"coastal Massachusetts"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"that maybe actually like"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"their parents were"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"lobsterman or something."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Pressed one seven inch."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Honestly,"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"it's almost giving me a flashback"
01:12:48;01:12:49;"because back in the day"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"I was so into like"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"regional garage"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"and surf compilations."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"You know,"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"there's like the famous"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"The Grave,"
01:12:57;01:12:58;"but there'd be these"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"even smaller regional ones."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"Like I had one"
01:13:00;01:13:01;"that was just"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"like northern New Jersey"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"where I'm from."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"Just knowing"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"that world pretty well"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"that it actually"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"makes so much sense"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"that there would have been"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"a coastal New England band"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"who would have been"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"listening to all the"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"California surf music"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"and with that kind of like"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"wry 60s sense of humor."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Be like,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"""We're not surfers up here."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"We are the lobsterman."""
01:13:21;01:13:22;"You know,"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"like I guarantee"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"there's something like that"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"somewhere."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Oh, for sure."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Rare nuggets of coastal"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Maine garage rock and surf."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"1963 to 1966."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"My friend had"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"the CD in his car of"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"it was like"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"specifically New England"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"garage rock from the 60s."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"I can't remember"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"if any was like"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"nautical themes really,"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"but it was this whole like"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"CD"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"and I was reading"
01:13:49;01:13:50;"the liner notes"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"and every one of the bands"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"was described as like"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"they almost got the same chance"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"that Jonathan Richmond got"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"or like they were almost"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"as big as the Liars"
01:14:01;01:14:02;"and then this happened"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"and it didn't work out"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"and they,"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"you know, broke up or whatever."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"I love those kinds of CDs though."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:14:09;01:14:10;"Speaking of which,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"I vaguely remember this"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"from"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"whatever four elections ago."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"John Kerry,"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"a consummate New Englander,"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"he went to some fancy"
01:14:21;01:14:22;"boarding school in New Hampshire"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"and he was in a garage rock"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"band and they recorded"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"one or two songs."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Really?"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"Did he sing?"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"I don't know what he did."
01:14:29;01:14:30;"Can we get a number crunch"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"on John Kerry's"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"prep school"
01:14:33;01:14:34;"garage rock band?"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Played bass poorly."
01:14:36;01:14:37;"I feel like maybe guitar"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"or saxophone."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"Oh."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"New Hampshire prep school nuggets"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"1962 to 1965."
01:14:44;01:14:47;"So you're from Maine,"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"so like"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"I don't think of Maine"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"as a place that bands"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"really tour to."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"Like did you see,"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"like did you start seeing"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"rock shows regularly"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"when you moved to Philly?"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Definitely a lot more."
01:14:58;01:14:59;"Bands would come"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"to Portland sometimes."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"I saw Dylan in Portland."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"I would see stuff like Ted Leo"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"and the pharmacists,"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"like they would come up there."
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Jonathan Richman came up"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"quite a bit too."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"But yeah, a lot of bands"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"seem to not."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"Do you feel a kinship"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"with Jonathan Richman"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"as a New Englander"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"or is Massachusetts"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"too far from Maine?"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"It's close enough for me."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"Yeah."
01:15:20;01:15:21;"I know he's a big fan"
01:15:21;01:15:22;"of Maine too."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"He has some song"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"where he's like,"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"I've seen Israel's Arid Plain."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"Sure, it's pretty,"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"but so is Maine."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"I definitely feel"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"a kinship with him."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"There's actually a funny story."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"So second grade's"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"guitar player, John,"
01:15:37;01:15:38;"he grew up in Natick,"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"Massachusetts,"
01:15:39;01:15:40;"which is the same town"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"as Jonathan Richman."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"And they even like went"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"to the same high school"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"at different times."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"And so my friend,"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"John met Jonathan one time"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"and he was like,"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"yo, Jonathan,"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"we went to the same high school."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"I think they should put"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"a statue of you"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"up in front of the high school."
01:15:58;01:16:01;"And Jonathan's response was,"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"no, man,"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"they ought to put a statue"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"of you at the high school,"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"which was..."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"That's perfect."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"Such a sweet Jonathan Richman."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"Like 100% just on brand."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"Yeah."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"See, I come from Boston."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"I'm going to tell you all"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"about how I love New England."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"It's my favorite place."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"I've been all around the world,"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"but I love New England best."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"I might be prejudiced,"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"but it's true."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I love New England best."
01:16:28;01:16:29;"Well, now,"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"give me a D by a stroke."
01:16:32;01:16:34;"That's pretty good."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Give me another one, though,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"without him."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"You know,"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"ladies and gentlemen,"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"I've already been to Paris,"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"already been to Rome."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"(scatting)"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"And what did I do"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"but miss my home?"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I have been out west"
01:16:53;01:16:57;"to California,"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"but I miss the land"
01:16:58;01:17:01;"where I was born."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"I can't help it."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"(scatting)"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Oh, New England."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"(scatting)"
01:17:10;01:17:11;"Oh, New England."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"Ride a while, man."
01:17:12;01:17:18;"(scatting)"
01:17:18;01:17:22;"(scatting)"
01:17:22;01:17:25;"I have seen old Israel's arid plain."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"(scatting)"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"It's magnificent,"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"but so's Maine."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"Oh, New England."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"John Kerry played the bass."
01:17:35;01:17:36;"Nailed it."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"Oh, good call."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"What was the name of the band?"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"The Electras."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"Okay, perfect."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"Specifically, I think it's"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"John Kerry and the Electras."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"(laughs)"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Philly?"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"John Kerry and the Electras."
01:17:51;01:17:53;"So, how did your"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Northern New England sensibilities"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"find Philly when you first moved there?"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"And also, how did you choose Philly"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"as the place to move?"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"What's wrong with Boston?"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"(laughs)"
01:18:03;01:18:06;"Well, don't get me started."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"Two cities that are often compared."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Yeah, there's similarities, yeah, for sure."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"I mean, I was ready to get out"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"of the New England winters,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"so Philly suits me fine."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"We ended up here"
01:18:17;01:18:20;"'cause Friendship's singer, Dan,"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"he had gone to college around here"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"at Haverford,"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"and so he was kind of familiar with Philly."
01:18:26;01:18:27;"He could vouch for it"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"as being a cool spot to be a band,"
01:18:30;01:18:31;"and that was kind of"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"all the convincing that I needed."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"What year was that?"
01:18:35;01:18:40;"That would have been like early 2015."
01:18:40;01:18:43;"So, yeah, is that like eight years ago,"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"seven years ago?"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"How old are you?"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"I'm 31."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"Okay, so you moved down there at 24."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"And been here ever since,"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"and not leaving anytime soon."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"Hell yeah."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"So you moved down there with Friendship"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"and you started second grade in Philly."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"I've only been to Philly twice."
01:19:00;01:19:01;"One was with Ezra and my brother"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"when Dirty Projectors played a show"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"at some bar there in 2005."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"And then the other time"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"I went there on an eighth grade field trip"
01:19:10;01:19:11;"'cause I'm from Connecticut."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"See the Liberty Bell?"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Exactly, I saw the Liberty Bell."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"But I see, you know,"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"I reach Pitchfork over here."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"I see Philly referenced all the time"
01:19:20;01:19:23;"as an amazing rock and roll town."
01:19:23;01:19:25;"And there's a lot of great bands from there."
01:19:25;01:19:26;"When you see that,"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"do you kind of roll your eyes"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"or are you sort of like,"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"""No, that tracks."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"""Philly is an amazing..."""
01:19:31;01:19:32;"'Cause it kind of has"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"a Portland 20 years ago"
01:19:34;01:19:35;"kind of feel to it."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Or that's the impression that I get."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Hmm."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Yeah, I think it tracks."
01:19:41;01:19:42;"Yeah, I think there's..."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"I mean, there's the handful of bands"
01:19:44;01:19:47;"that get a lot of attention from Philly."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"And I'm happy for those bands for sure."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"Like, they deserve it."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"They're doing great stuff."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"Who are the big Philly bands"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"or like the getting a lot of..."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Like Kurt Vile"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"or that's kind of a different generation?"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"It is a different generation"
01:19:59;01:20:02;"but he still is like very beloved"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"here and elsewhere"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"and sort of seen as like"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"an ambassador of Philly rock, I guess."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"And maybe like the War on Drugs too."
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I guess they live in LA now though."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"So maybe not."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Hmm."
01:20:14;01:20:17;"Like Alex G is like"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"the hometown hero."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"Oh, right, right."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Right now for sure."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Sheermag."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"And Sheermag."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Yeah, Sheermag."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"I haven't heard from them"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"in a little bit though."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Yeah."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"Maybe there's some new music."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"A lot of the people you referenced"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I think are like born and raised"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"Pennsylvanians."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Does it ever get weird"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"being a main guy"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"in Philly?"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"I don't perceive any weirdness."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"I don't know."
01:20:43;01:20:46;"Maybe people have it out for me"
01:20:46;01:20:47;"behind my back"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"because I'm not..."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"In the scene?"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"It's possible."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Did you know he's not even"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"from Pennsylvania?"
01:20:52;01:20:53;"Yeah."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"But then it's like"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"the response to that is like,"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"okay, I could have stayed in Maine"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"and played music"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"but how many musicians"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"can you name from Maine?"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"And the list is pretty short."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"What's his name?"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"American Pie."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Don McLean?"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"Don McLean's from Maine?"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Yeah, Don McLean."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Whoa."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Well, he lives in Maine."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"He's a long time Maine resident."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Oh, interesting."
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Wow."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"I did not know that."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"It's also funny to me."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"There's something interesting"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"about you going from Maine"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"to Philly because"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"no disrespect to"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"Delaware, Washington, D.C."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"But to me,"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"the East Coast that I really"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"know and understand"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"starts in Philly"
01:21:32;01:21:33;"and ends in Maine."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"You know what I mean?"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"I truly feel like once you get"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"past Philly,"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"it's something else."
01:21:38;01:21:40;"Of course, there's like a kinship"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"but like Delaware and D.C."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"Mid-Atlantic."
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Yeah, mid-Atlantic."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Whereas like Philly,"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"New York and Boston"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"are the three like true"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"big East Coast cities."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And then you at Maine"
01:21:50;01:21:51;"as part of like"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"obviously the New England region."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"I think people should have"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"write a free passage"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"from one place to the other"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"without getting any guff."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"Oh, totally."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Yeah, that feels right to me."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"Hey, Peter,"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"are you like zipping something"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"or like there's some crazy sound"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"on your side?"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:22:07;01:22:10;"I'm about to be on the move here"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"because this dog suit"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"just ended."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"Oh, I see."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"Walk and talk, walk and talk."
01:22:16;01:22:18;"I might have to walk and talk."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Is that okay?"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Of course."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"I just think you were like"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"moving the zipper"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"on your jacket or something."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I might have been, yeah."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"All right."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Could I like,"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"is it possible to call back in"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"in like five minutes?"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"Sure, I think so."
01:22:34;01:22:35;"We're going to lose this"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"in 10 minutes."
01:22:36;01:22:37;"I might be gone,"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"but great to meet you, Peter."
01:22:38;01:22:39;"I'll be here."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"I hope I can catch a show one day."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Oh, thank you so much."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Yeah, good talking to you."
01:22:44;01:22:45;"Peace."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"I'm actually really into"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"the kind of like community"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"radio vibe of just like"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"having a guest on and you're like,"
01:22:51;01:22:52;"well, you know,"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"I'm dog sitting."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Can I call you back in five?"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Absolutely."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"You know, there was this one"
01:22:57;01:22:58;"I was listening to this one,"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"Lana, she doesn't do that many,"
01:23:01;01:23:02;"but there was this one"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"Lana Del Rey interview"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I was listening to."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"Phil was on BBC"
01:23:06;01:23:09;"and do you hear like ding dong?"
01:23:09;01:23:10;"And she's like,"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"oh, there's some guy here"
01:23:11;01:23:12;"for the chimney or something."
01:23:12;01:23:13;"And she leaves"
01:23:13;01:23:14;"and this whole thing keeps"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"while she's doing this interview."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"There is something very fun about,"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"you know, real life."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"Oh, yeah."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"People should bring more"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"of that energy to BBC interviews,"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"CNN, just like not everything"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"has to be so fast paced."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"It should be like,"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"hold on a minute."
01:23:33;01:23:34;"I got to take something"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"out of the oven."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"Postmates is here."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"All right."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"So Jake, you're going to have"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"a plane today."
01:23:41;01:23:42;"Oh, I got to leave"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"a little bit early,"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"but I think this will be interesting"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"because it doesn't happen that often."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Yeah, I got to jump."
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Speaking of community radio,"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"I got to go."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"Got to go on a field trip with my son."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"You guys land the plane."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Where do you recommend, Jake,"
01:23:55;01:23:58;"that people start with Second Grid?"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"I mean, they have three albums."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"The new one's great."
01:24:02;01:24:04;"And the one before that hit to hit"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"is really great."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"I've been listening to the new one"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"a ton the last few weeks."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"I like it."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Why don't we throw on Kramer in L.A.,"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"the aforementioned Kramer in L.A."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"for a second."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"This is definitely sort of"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"a left field track,"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"but that's what I like about this band."
01:24:17;01:24:20;"There's a lot of left field ideas."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"Let's throw it on."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"Right, like this is not"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"the most typical Second Grid vibe,"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"but it's appropriate for this show."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Yeah."

01:28:15;01:28:19;"So really cool to meet you over the Internet here."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"Wow, yeah."
01:28:20;01:28:21;"Thank you so much."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"That's so good to hear."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Yeah, wow."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"I love all three records."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"I love the new one."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"One thing--"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"OK, here's a question."
01:28:29;01:28:33;"I've been reading the press and stuff around your band."
01:28:33;01:28:37;"The term ""power pop"" gets thrown around so much,"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"and I've always found that term a little slippery."
01:28:40;01:28:44;"I think of individual songs as being kind of power pop."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"Certainly songs within your catalog would fit into that."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"I don't think of you guys as a power pop band"
01:28:50;01:28:53;"because you have so many different ideas."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"There's more humor in your music."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"You have these beautiful ballads,"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"which I don't really think of as power pop."
01:28:59;01:29:05;"So to you, what's a quintessential power pop album or artist?"
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Yeah, well, it's such an interesting question"
01:29:08;01:29:13;"because the first one that jumps to mind for me is Big Star"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"and probably Big Star's first record."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"But then if you start thinking about what is power pop"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"and you come up with a definition,"
01:29:22;01:29:26;"suddenly Big Star doesn't even fit into that category anymore."
01:29:26;01:29:28;"I've always been confused as them"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"seeing them classified as power pop."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"Is the Ballad of El Gudu on that?"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"Yeah, it's on number one record."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"To me, that's like, I don't know."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"The lyrics are weird."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"I just find that..."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"To me, power pop is sort of Beatles-y or something."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:29:48;01:29:53;"Yeah, I think classic power pop is like McCartney-esque, kind of."
01:29:53;01:29:59;"It is derived from '65 and before, like Beatles."
01:29:59;01:30:04;"And it's later bands trying to recreate that snappy guitar sound."
01:30:04;01:30:08;"Which, yeah, is totally not what Big Star is about."
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Which is so interesting."
01:30:10;01:30:13;"I think for me, my personal definition"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"of the kind of power pop I want to pursue"
01:30:16;01:30:20;"is that Big Star kind of sound where there's a lot of ballads"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"and it's very jangly"
01:30:22;01:30:28;"and it isn't as formulaic or scientific of pop songs."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"But for some reason,"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"Big Star isn't power pop"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"but it also is."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"I guess that was my entry point to the genre, too."
01:30:38;01:30:42;"Yeah, it is a slippery slope. Absolutely."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"As a fan, I just don't like seeing you guys boxed in."
01:30:45;01:30:48;"That's fair. I appreciate that."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"I think I did it to us."
01:30:51;01:30:56;"I was probably the first one telling everyone that we're power pop."
01:30:56;01:31:00;"Just because it felt like an easy box to put us in"
01:31:00;01:31:03;"to get people excited about it, maybe."
01:31:03;01:31:06;"I didn't like listening to it in the first place."
01:31:06;01:31:09;"It's more specific than indie rock."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"We'll go to bed, you guys. Indie..."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"Yeah, pretty useless term."
01:31:14;01:31:17;"People sometimes ask me, ""You're a musician."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"What kind of music do you play?"""
01:31:20;01:31:23;"If the person asking me is a musician,"
01:31:23;01:31:27;"I can get deep into the minutia of different sub-genres."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"But if it's someone that is not a musician,"
01:31:30;01:31:33;"I usually say, ""I play indie rock."""
01:31:33;01:31:36;"And usually they go, ""Oh, cool."""
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Like your parents' friends?"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"""Yeah, it's like, uh..."""
01:31:41;01:31:46;"I like talking to people that have no frame of reference past the '70s."
01:31:46;01:31:49;"""Yeah, it's kind of like The Beatles."""
01:31:49;01:31:54;"Yeah, just grasping for any frame of reference that they can understand."

01:37:01;01:37:04;"and criticizes an aspect of the show ""Cheers."""
01:37:04;01:37:06;"What part of the show ""Cheers"""
01:37:06;01:37:09;"does George have a problem with?"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"[laughs]"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"Uh..."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"Oh, geez."
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Yeah, I got no idea."
01:37:16;01:37:18;"It's the fact that it's set at a bar."
01:37:18;01:37:21;"The line is, ""Enough with the bar already."""
01:37:21;01:37:23;"[laughs]"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"I can picture that."
01:37:25;01:37:26;"It's genius."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"It's a good moment."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Siamese or melancholy?"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Uh, Siamese."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"It's more focused, I guess,"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"and just has some of my..."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Warm."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"...favorite moments from them."
01:37:38;01:37:41;"I always remember hearing ""Today"""
01:37:41;01:37:44;"for the very first time in headphones."
01:37:44;01:37:46;"And, you know, the intro is so quiet"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"with that guitar, and I cranked it up."
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Like, ""Why is it so quiet?"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Is something wrong with my CD player?"""
01:37:52;01:37:55;"And then just getting blasted with noise."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"And it's like, ""Oh, they got me real good there."""
01:37:58;01:38:00;"I always respected that move."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"Yeah."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"I mean, they're the kings of that."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"I'll do one more."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"And by the way, I love this song."
01:38:06;01:38:08;"I was listening to it a lot today."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"Thanks."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"At one point in the trip to L.A.,"
01:38:11;01:38:14;"Kramer is seen in a montage in Venice."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"Engaging in which recreational activity?"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"A. Skateboarding, B. Surfing,"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"C. Roller skating, D. Hang gliding."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"Uh, I think it's roller skating."
01:38:24;01:38:25;"Yes."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"All right, yeah."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"Roller skating. Very Kramer."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Yeah, totally."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"Nice."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"I gotta swing back to GBV"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"'cause they're one of my favorites of all time."
01:38:34;01:38:35;"Yeah, me too."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"Top five Pollard releases."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"Could be GBV, could be Psy Projects,"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"could be Circus Devils."
01:38:42;01:38:43;"I don't care."
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Top five."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"Wow."
01:38:45;01:38:46;"Here we go."
01:38:46;01:38:47;"This is a tough one."
01:38:47;01:38:50;"They're probably all gonna be GBV for me."
01:38:50;01:38:52;"And I mean, right off the bat,"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"like, three of them are gonna be taken up"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"by your B-1000,"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"your Alien Lanes,"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"and your Under the Bushes, Under the Stars."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"Straight up."
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Yeah, like, I can't--"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"I cannot deny those three."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"For the final two,"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"let's go with, uh,"
01:39:09;01:39:10;"goodness."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"I am quite partial to--"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"what's that one called?"
01:39:14;01:39:15;"Sunfish--"
01:39:15;01:39:16;"Holy Breakfast."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Yeah."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"That one's beautiful."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"There's some really beautiful ballads on there."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Mm-hmm."
01:39:22;01:39:26;"And I really stan, uh,"
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Do the Collapse."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Interesting."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"Which I know some people would say"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"it might be their worst album,"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"but it has some real high points for me."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"Surgical Focus is probably--"
01:39:36;01:39:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:37;01:39:40;"Like, one of my all-time favorite GBV songs."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Yep. That one's amazing."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"As is, uh, Things That I Will Keep."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"That song--I think it's, like, track three or whatever."
01:39:47;01:39:48;"Oh, yeah."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"That song is genius."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I'm a big fan of Wrecking Now."
01:39:52;01:39:53;"Wrecking Now."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"Yeah, like, how do you--"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"who writes a melody like that?"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"Pretty incredible."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"I could say no way"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"But she's calling out my voice"
01:40:06;01:40:10;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:10;01:40:15;"And so I'm through with you"
01:40:15;01:40:19;"She's bleeding now"
01:40:19;01:40:23;"She's repeating now"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"She's defeating now"
01:40:26;01:40:30;"Wrecking Now"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Have you seen them live?"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"No, I haven't."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Uh, I had tickets to see them"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"in Atlantic City this summer,"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"and then the show just, like,"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"got canceled for some reason."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"Huh."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"Uh, so that was a bummer."
01:40:42;01:40:45;"And they're coming back to Philly in December,"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"but the problem is they're playing"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"with Dinosaur Jr."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"Yeah?"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Who--I like Dinosaur Jr.,"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"but I don't want to lose my hearing that way."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"And I also just--I want to see"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"the whole unadulterated GBV set,"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"you know, I don't want to have it cut"
01:41:00;01:41:01;"with, like, another band."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Do you know who's playing first?"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Or are they alternating?"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"I don't know, actually."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Yeah, maybe I'll look into it."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"I saw Dinosaur Jr. in GBV this past year"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"at Pappy and Harriet's,"
01:41:14;01:41:15;"which is a great outdoor venue"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"in the desert,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"which second grade should play."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"Dinosaur's not as loud as they used--"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"I mean, I never saw them in, like,"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"the '90s when they were really, like,"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"you know, fabled for their volume."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"It was pretty normal."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Oh, okay."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"That's good to know."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"Those guys are old, too,"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"so it's like they can't be doing"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"what they were doing 30 years ago,"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"volume-wise."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Word."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"So you would say go to that show?"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"Well, all right, yeah."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"Now I'm considering it, for sure."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"'Cause I like them."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"Yeah, I like the records a lot."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Do you think you guys are gonna"
01:41:49;01:41:50;"hit the road next year?"
01:41:50;01:41:51;"Oh, totally."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Yeah."
01:41:52;01:41:55;"There's no plans currently set in stone,"
01:41:55;01:41:57;"but I know that we gotta get out there,"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"for sure."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"I mean, I would love to do"
01:42:00;01:42:01;"the whole U.S."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Yeah."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"If we can swing it."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"I've never toured west"
01:42:04;01:42:07;"of, like, the Dakotas before,"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"so I'm, like, really dying to get"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"to California, get to the whole"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"west coast, and, like,"
01:42:12;01:42:13;"do the whole thing."
01:42:13;01:42:14;"Yeah."
01:42:14;01:42:15;"Fingers crossed."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"I hope it happens."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"Oh, I saw you're playing"
01:42:17;01:42:20;"with Dear Nora in Philly."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"Yeah, we're so psyched for that."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"I love Dear Nora."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"I love all the new songs"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"I've heard so far."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"Katie's a really old friend of mine."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"I used to play in that band."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"I know, yeah."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Yeah, yeah."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"Circa '08, well,"
01:42:32;01:42:33;"circa late '90s,"
01:42:33;01:42:37;"and then circa, like, '04, '05, '06."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Yeah, so cool, that connection."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"I know, it's crazy."
01:42:41;01:42:42;"So, yeah, you can tell"
01:42:42;01:42:46;"that I'm, like, a professional radio."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"You're doing great, yeah."
01:42:48;01:42:50;"Matt, should we do the top five?"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Yeah, let's do it."
01:42:51;01:42:55;"It's time for the top five"
01:42:55;01:42:58;"on iTunes."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"We're going to do the top five"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Billboard 100 from this week"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"in 1991."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Why '91?"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Why 1991, Seinfeld?"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"It's the year that Peter Gill,"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"our guest, was born."
01:43:07;01:43:10;"Yeah, hello."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"Before we get going,"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"I just want to do a quick check-in"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"with Jake and see how you're feeling"
01:43:15;01:43:16;"about flying this plane."
01:43:16;01:43:17;"It's happening."
01:43:17;01:43:18;"You know, it's a little shaky."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"It's not as smooth"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"as it normally is with Ezra here,"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"but I feel like we're doing all right."
01:43:23;01:43:24;"I feel like the vibe"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"of the show immediately changed."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"It's become a little bit more relaxed."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"I feel --"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"I think it's going great, Jake."
01:43:31;01:43:32;"Okay."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"I appreciate that."
01:43:33;01:43:35;"I mean, both versions are great."
01:43:35;01:43:36;"Yeah."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"The Reese's Winter --"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"This is TZ After Dark."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"It definitely has a very --"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"Yeah."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"It has, like, yeah,"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"kind of what Peter was talking about."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Like, the community radio."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Yeah, community radio vibes."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"This is the --"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"It's the Reese's Winter recipe of TZ."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"Zero to 10, though."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"How do you rate how you're doing?"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"And this is not to be critical."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"I just said this is a check-in."
01:44:01;01:44:04;"I'm at, like, a four or five."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"I think it's a solid --"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"I think it's a solid 7.5."
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Okay."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Great."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"I'm not weighing in."
