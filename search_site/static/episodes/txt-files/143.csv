00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake returns to tell us about Pasadena Hospital food,"
00:07;00:14;"the birth of Subway, The Beatles, and so much more. We dip our toes into Tampa Bay,"
00:14;00:23;"discuss Herman's Hermits, and other great music. Reunited, together again, this is"
00:23;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
01:13;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake, welcome back to the show."
01:20;01:22;"Great to be here, great to be here."
01:22;01:28;"Really was missing you on the last step, really could have used you as we went toe-to-toe with Robert Rosenberg."
01:28;01:29;"How was the interview?"
01:29;01:35;"It was solid, he's a great dude. He was down to talk about the whole Dunkin' Donuts story."
01:35;01:40;"A lot of nuggets of wisdom, but of course you had bigger fish to fry, we understand."
01:40;01:44;"Might have been weird for you to drop everything while you were at the hospital."
01:44;01:48;"Although you did attempt to have me call in."
01:48;01:51;"Right, we wondered if we could get you on the phone for like a tight 15."
01:51;01:57;"And I was like, I can't do it guys. Yeah, because Hannah was literally in labor at that point,"
01:57;01:59;"because you guys were taping on a Wednesday."
01:59;02:00;"Right."
02:00;02:04;"You know, I think our daughter was born during the taping of TC."
02:04;02:09;"Because she was born at 6.30, two Wednesdays ago, which we usually tape on a Wednesday."
02:09;02:11;"Oh, so it's definitely possible."
02:11;02:12;"I mean, that feels cosmic."
02:12;02:14;"Yeah, deeply."
02:14;02:21;"But yeah, I couldn't make it to the phone to weigh in on the minutiae of the Dunkin' book."
02:21;02:24;"Can you guys keep it down? I'm on the phone with Robert Rosenberg."
02:24;02:27;"Guys, chill out."
02:27;02:36;"Well, we were talking before the show, and it wouldn't be too TC to get like super personal about the beautiful miracle of life type thing."
02:36;02:37;"Absolutely not."
02:37;02:49;"But the TC angle to your experience is not to talk about your child or the beautiful life affirming experience."
02:49;02:55;"You and your partner shared the TC way in and say, you were roaming the halls of a hospital for five days."
02:55;02:59;"What the hell were you eating? What's going on over there, man?"
02:59;03:03;"Well, first of all, I wasn't roaming the halls because of COVID."
03:03;03:12;"We were stuck in our hospital room, and we went in on a Monday evening and left on a Saturday morning with our baby daughter."
03:12;03:15;"So, we were in there for five nights."
03:15;03:16;"Whoa."
03:16;03:26;"We were in the hospital room. Ordinarily, I think you could probably leave the hospital, walk across the street, get a coffee, pick up some groceries, maybe get some takeout, go back to the hospital."
03:26;03:28;"But in this situation, no dice."
03:28;03:34;"So, we were ordering off the Huntington Hospital cafeteria menu for those five days."
03:34;03:36;"You couldn't even go to the cafeteria?"
03:36;03:40;"No, it was all, you would call in the order, and they would bring it to you."
03:40;03:42;"Just getting that hospital room service?"
03:42;03:48;"I literally could not pace the halls. I couldn't be a 1950s guy smoking a cigarette in the hall."
03:48;03:51;"""Oh, what's going on in there?"""
03:51;03:54;"Oh, man. I didn't realize it was that locked down."
03:54;03:56;"Extremely locked down."
03:56;03:59;"You were literally in one room for five days?"
03:59;04:04;"Well, two rooms, because the first two days, we were in the labor and delivery room."
04:04;04:10;"And then after the baby was born, they put us in a maternity room, and we were there for a few days."
04:10;04:15;"In addition to the food you're ordering, did you roll with like a go bag full of snacks?"
04:15;04:16;"Cliff bars."
04:16;04:17;"Modellos?"
04:17;04:22;"Didn't bring any brew. I didn't think that would be tone appropriate."
04:22;04:24;"Could you order a beer on -"
04:24;04:28;"No, there was no alcohol on the menu. I did look."
04:28;04:36;"I was reading somewhere before the birth, like reading some of the blog about like what their go bag was in the hospital."
04:36;04:39;"And someone was writing about like, ""Oh, man, I brought some beer."""
04:39;04:44;"But then I was like, ""Is it going to be a mini fridge in the hospital room?"""
04:44;04:47;"I'm not going to crack a lukewarm brew."
04:47;04:51;"I mean, even if there was a mini fridge, it just would have been in poor taste, I think."
04:51;04:58;"I'm sure there's people that do it. I'm sure there's people that roll in or like during normal times, not COVID times,"
04:58;05:01;"people like their buddy rolls in with like a 12 pack."
05:01;05:04;"I'm sure that happens. That would have been triumphant."
05:04;05:07;"Like people sneak in a bottle of champagne."
05:07;05:08;"Right."
05:08;05:13;"Actually, now that we're talking about it, doesn't that sound like a movie or something where like some dude gets shot"
05:13;05:16;"and then his like buddies go and hang out with him."
05:16;05:20;"He's like having a laugh and he's like, ""Oh!"" You know?"
05:20;05:24;"And they're like, somebody pulls out like a bottle of whiskey at the hospital."
05:24;05:27;"A little like a hospital party. That happens."
05:27;05:29;"Never participated in one."
05:29;05:38;"I feel like there's no context in which me sneaking booze into the hospital delivery room is going to work out well."
05:38;05:42;"I just, it's not a good look for me."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:44;"It's just like..."
05:44;05:45;"You're banned from the hospital?"
05:45;05:47;"It's just not a good vibe."
05:47;05:58;"I could be holding you tonight. I could quit doing wrong and start doing right."
05:58;06:09;"You don't care about what I think. Think I'll just stay here and drink."
06:09;06:20;"Hey, putting you down won't square the deal. At least you know the way I feel."
06:20;06:30;"Hey, take all the money in the bank. Think I'll just stay here and drink."
06:30;06:35;"Here's what I'll say off the top. The breakfast sandwich at Huntington Hospital, superb."
06:35;06:36;"Really?"
06:36;06:47;"It's like a homemade egg McMuffin. Fluffy, well scrambled eggs, a little slice of Canadian bacon, slice of melted cheese on an English muffin. Great."
06:47;06:51;"You're saying it's like as good as what you might expect at a kind of like artisanal cafe kind of vibe?"
06:51;06:55;"Oh, for sure. That is by far their standout item."
06:55;06:57;"Oh, that's tight."
06:57;06:59;"How late do they serve it to?"
06:59;07:04;"All day. Well, from like 6.30am to I think 7pm."
07:04;07:08;"Oh, really? Did you ever hit it for like multiple meals in one day?"
07:08;07:12;"Thought about it. Really, really considered it."
07:12;07:17;"I'm going to go wild, get the breakfast sandwich for lunch. Keep things interesting."
07:17;07:19;"And dinner, why not?"
07:19;07:24;"That's the Huntington Hospital triple crown is when you have the breakfast sandwich for all three meals."
07:24;07:29;"Yeah, like in the kitchen, they're just like, oh, yep, long stress, back in number three."
07:29;07:40;"That's tight because I actually associate like eggs as being a very simple, good thing that gets absolutely destroyed by industrial catering."
07:40;07:51;"I just have like memories of being someplace where they have like the giant metal tray of just like terrible, you know, scrambled eggs that they just make en masse."
07:51;07:56;"Yeah, like the color is like this, like sulfuric, like neon yellow."
07:56;08:00;"Yeah, or sometimes they get like gray. There's a kind of like gray scrambled eggs."
08:00;08:04;"But it just makes me think of some like being on like a ferry."
08:04;08:06;"I think those might be powdered eggs."
08:06;08:08;"Ah, yeah. Tastes terrible."
08:08;08:14;"OK, so at Bed Huntington, it sounds like some handmade crack the egg made to order."
08:14;08:17;"All right. So that was far and away the best item. Anything else good?"
08:17;08:20;"Yeah. Personal pan pizza, not bad."
08:20;08:26;"No, I don't think so, because each one was sort of irregular."
08:26;08:35;"Maybe like Papa John's style where they're like the cafeteria is buying cold dough, you know, like pre-made dough and then their hands stretching and topping."
08:35;08:45;"That's my guess. But when someone is going into labor at a certain point, the doctors restrict her food intake and she can only have like clear liquids, you know."
08:45;08:53;"So Hannah had not eaten in a while. And so as we were getting deep into the labor process, I was like, oh, I better get a food order in."
08:53;09:01;"I ordered a few pizzas that actually were delivered to the room during a pretty critical time in the delivery, which is also comical."
09:01;09:07;"It must happen to all the time with like the food people at these hospitals just like coming in at the weirdest times."
09:07;09:14;"But after our baby was born, we just like destroyed these personal pan pizzas."
09:14;09:20;"In case you're wondering, Ezra, Aramark does not supply the food at Huntington Hospital."
09:20;09:26;"Sounds like Huntington Hospital might be like an independent operation. Handmade breakfast sandwiches."
09:26;09:28;"Yeah. Pizza to order."
09:28;09:34;"Do you think people are just ever going there just for the food on its own, like treating it like a restaurant?"
09:34;09:40;"I mean, if I lived in the area, like I could see you like walking over there and getting that breakfast sandwich."
09:40;09:47;"And I feel like the word is out on that because I talked to some other couples that had had babies at Huntington and they were like, food's not bad."
09:47;09:50;"So we had that working for us."
09:50;10:01;"Well, especially now. Now it's going to get the TC bump. Just people kind of some food shows. Stanley Tucci rolling up to Pasadena."
10:01;10:06;"Is the Huntington Hospital cafeteria on Uber Eats by chance?"
10:06;10:09;"It's not a bad idea."
10:09;10:11;"I'm currently looking at the menu."
10:11;10:12;"Oh, nice."
10:12;10:16;"Did you get any of their sort of main entree dinners?"
10:16;10:18;"Remind me what was there again?"
10:18;10:22;"Well, they have a spaghetti. They have a pesto, a marinade, a meat sauce, a rigatoni."
10:22;10:27;"I got the pesto with like penne, a rigatoni or something. Pretty good."
10:27;10:30;"Yeah. Roast turkey and gravy."
10:30;10:32;"Didn't do that."
10:32;10:35;"I did get the chicken pot pie, which was very disappointing."
10:35;10:37;"Damn."
10:37;10:43;"This feels like the next TC bootleg merch, like the Huntington Hospital restaurant."
10:43;10:47;"Chicken pot pie at the Huntington Hospital."
10:47;10:50;"Very disappointing."
10:50;10:56;"So because you were confined to the room, you couldn't even do like a classic vending machine run?"
10:56;10:59;"I bet I could have if I was super stealth about it."
10:59;11:01;"Go grab a quick baby Ruth."
11:01;11:04;"Yeah, Snickers. Load up on some Snickers."
11:04;11:08;"So it was easy enough to order food, so like it never got dire?"
11:08;11:11;"Just being in one room for that long or two rooms, it sounds so wild."
11:11;11:15;"The first day was like, what is happening? And then you just get into like the rhythm."
11:15;11:17;"What about coffee?"
11:17;11:22;"Terrible, inedible. What I did was I'd order a cup of coffee and then I'd order a hot chocolate."
11:22;11:24;"And then I would just combine them."
11:24;11:25;"Whoa."
11:25;11:31;"It's actually drinkable because this just the coffee on its own was like 1972 like diner coffee."
11:31;11:34;"It's actually Starbucks coffee."
11:34;11:36;"At Huntington Hospital?"
11:36;11:39;"You know what? That didn't surprise me because as we've discussed in the program before,"
11:39;11:43;"just the black Starbucks coffee, just like the daily brew, inedible."
11:43;11:47;"It's funny, Jake, because that was a big topic of conversation with Robert Rosenberg,"
11:47;11:52;"how in the era when Dunkin Donuts started to take off,"
11:52;11:58;"he confirmed to us that the average adult had never had a decent cup of coffee in their life."
11:58;12:02;"Everybody was just drinking this brown sludge instant coffee."
12:02;12:06;"He said the only place you could get a decent cup of coffee in most cities"
12:06;12:11;"was like an after-dinner special blend cup at a fancy hotel."
12:11;12:12;"Oh, wow."
12:12;12:17;"So this coffee that you're describing, it is worth pouring some out for the people from generations past"
12:17;12:21;"who probably drank nothing but that for their entire life."
12:21;12:28;"Were you just hitting a hot chocolate coffee blend like 7 a.m. most days at the hospital?"
12:28;12:29;"Every day."
12:29;12:30;"Wow."
12:30;12:35;"I knew I could tell the coffee would be terrible, so I preemptively made that move day one."
12:35;12:38;"I was like, ""Let's get a coffee and a hot chocolate."""
12:38;12:42;"I feel like that was really like maybe the move that really preserved my sanity the most."
12:42;12:43;"Interesting."
12:43;12:48;"I mean, hot chocolate is a classic nice treat that people forget about"
12:48;12:55;"until one day it's like you're snowed in or it's like freezing or somebody offers it to you"
12:55;12:59;"or you had too much coffee and you're walking around in a cold place and it's the afternoon"
12:59;13:01;"and then suddenly you remember like hot chocolate."
13:01;13:05;"Very special treat, so it's nice that you had an opportunity to hit that."
13:05;13:08;"[Laughter]"
13:08;13:10;"They should add that to the menu."
13:10;13:11;"The Jake."
13:11;13:13;"Oh, the Jake. Yeah."
13:13;13:16;"Actually, it should be the Jake Longstreth because it's like an Arnold Palmer"
13:16;13:22;"except it's half dog s*** hospital coffee and half hot chocolate."
13:22;13:25;"That is the Jake Longstreth."
13:25;13:26;"The Jake Longstreth."
14:13;14:15;"This is unusual."
14:15;14:23;"Matt just sent me a Yelp review, a five-star Yelp review of the bistro at Huntington Hospital."
14:23;14:25;"It's just an interesting review."
14:25;14:26;"Oh, cool."
14:26;14:28;"Gosh, the food is great, but only on weekdays."
14:28;14:31;"I've been there on the weekend and I've been so disappointed,"
14:31;14:35;"but I still have to give credit to the staff for a wonderful job on that delicious food."
14:35;14:38;"I keep going back for more."
14:38;14:39;"Whoa."
14:39;14:41;"I keep going back for more."
14:41;14:45;"There's just a neighborhood person that goes to the cafeteria, just walks in."
14:45;14:46;"At the hospital."
14:46;14:50;"I mean, yeah, during normal times, people can just roll into a hospital."
14:50;14:52;"They're not like stopping you at the door."
14:52;14:58;"That's funny though because like Huntington Hospital is located in like pretty centrally in Pasadena."
14:58;15:03;"Like there's a Vons literally across the street and there's like a chicken shawarma place."
15:03;15:09;"There's like a bunch of like restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance of the hospital."
15:09;15:13;"So, it's funny to think about someone just being like, I'm in that hospital."
15:13;15:15;"I love that ambiance."
15:15;15:18;"Well, you never even got to experience what the bistro is actually like."
15:18;15:20;"Maybe it is just a good vibe."
15:20;15:21;"No, it could be."
15:21;15:22;"Yeah."
15:22;15:24;"I mean, the hospital itself is pretty beautiful."
15:24;15:27;"Like the exterior and like the entryway, it feels like a hotel."
15:27;15:29;"I mean, like the rooms don't."
15:29;15:30;"It's like a nice old hospital."
15:30;15:33;"Yeah, like once you're in the hospital like itself, it feels like a hospital."
15:33;15:36;"But the actual like entryway is like very stately."
15:36;15:37;"Interesting."
15:37;15:38;"Surprising."
15:38;15:39;"I'd never been before."
15:39;15:40;"So."
15:40;15:44;"Pasadena is such a major location for you in your life, Jake."
15:44;15:49;"From Dead Knight and the Dina at the Old Town Pub to Uncle Ted."
15:49;15:55;"Uncle Ted watching Van Halen play early days on somebody's tennis court."
15:55;15:56;"Birth of your child."
15:56;15:58;"It's the birth of my mom too."
15:58;15:59;"That's wild."
15:59;16:00;"Wow."
16:00;16:01;"Oh, yeah."
16:01;16:05;"I may have said this before on the show, but one of my earliest restaurant memories is"
16:05;16:13;"that the hospital where my sister was born when I was four years old had a McDonald's."
16:13;16:14;"So."
16:14;16:15;"Oh, man."
16:15;16:20;"I remember very little about like the specifics of her birth other than that on the ground"
16:20;16:22;"floor there was a McDonald's at the hospital."
16:22;16:28;"And just kind of like, I mean, I imagine I probably was like a little bit confused about"
16:28;16:30;"going to the hospital a few times."
16:30;16:33;"Like I probably didn't at four probably didn't fully understand what was happening."
16:33;16:36;"But I'm sure everybody was like, it's tight."
16:36;16:37;"There's a McDonald's there."
16:37;16:44;"I imagine that there are far fewer McDonald's in hospitals over the past 20, 30 years."
16:44;16:46;"I think that's a good guess."
16:46;16:47;"You know, it's funny."
16:47;16:48;"There's actually a good transition."
16:48;16:51;"I bet a lot of them were replaced by Subways."
16:51;16:55;"Like you can totally picture just like."
16:55;16:56;"Yeah."
16:56;16:58;"Subway franchisees being like, you know what?"
16:58;17:00;"Subway is the fastest growing chain in the world."
17:00;17:01;"It's healthy."
17:01;17:07;"McDonald's is dominated in a lot of spaces and like go talk to like the president of"
17:07;17:12;"a hospital or the, you know, board of executives and being like, guys, it's 2003."
17:12;17:18;"Are you really still having a McDonald's in a place where you're healing people?"
17:18;17:19;"You need a Subway."
17:19;17:22;"People need to eat fresh in a hospital."
17:22;17:23;"McDonald's is a bad vibe."
17:23;17:26;"I bet there's way more Subways now."
17:26;17:27;"I'm sure you're right."
17:27;17:32;"I mean, it's fascinating to me that your four year old brain picked up on the McDonald's"
17:32;17:35;"being in this in the hospital."
17:35;17:37;"Well, I'm sure that's all I was thinking about."
17:37;17:40;"I think that there's legislation against it."
17:40;17:41;"Right."
17:41;17:47;"So there are 15 states that allow fast food in hospitals."
17:47;17:53;"Florida and Texas earn the dishonorable mention, according to this HuffPost article I'm reading,"
17:53;17:57;"for being the states with the most fast food locations inside of hospitals."
17:57;17:59;"People always beating up on Florida and Texas."
17:59;18:01;"They can't catch a break."
18:01;18:03;"Come on."
18:03;18:04;"But it depends what it is."
18:04;18:07;"I mean, like, are they including like Chipotle?"
18:07;18:10;"A lot of people would be psyched if there's a Chipotle at the hospital."
18:10;18:11;"A Jamba Juice?"
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, Jamba Juice."
18:13;18:14;"Very healthy."
18:14;18:20;"I mean, is Chipotle going to be much more unhealthy than like just random cafeteria fare?"
18:20;18:21;"Probably not."
18:21;18:22;"You know, it'd be pretty tight."
18:22;18:23;"I always think of this."
18:23;18:26;"I'm sure I've talked about it before, but I remember hitting the--"
18:26;18:28;"I think with you, Jake, on the early Dirty Projector story,"
18:28;18:37;"I remember hitting an IHOP in El Paso for breakfast as we made our way, you know,"
18:37;18:39;"to New Mexico or whatever."
18:39;18:42;"An IHOP would actually be pretty tight to have in a hospital."
18:42;18:48;"A bleary-eyed hospital morning, got no sleep, go down to the lobby,"
18:48;18:53;"get up in an IHOP, get some eggs, bacon, some nice pancakes."
18:53;18:56;"That'd be like a really kind vibe energy at a hospital."
18:56;18:57;"That would rule."
18:57;19:02;"I don't know if ""kind vibe"" is the word I'm looking for, but yeah."
19:05;19:08;"It doesn't really matter 'cause there ain't no one around."
19:08;19:11;"Tiptoe through the alley and tiptoe through your life."
19:11;19:15;"You still gotta come and be a gun, be a knife."
19:15;19:20;"Next thing you know, you're eating hospital food."
19:38;19:41;"Karaoke castration to the most polite."
19:41;19:45;"He's gonna sting you anyway, tiptoe through the hive."
19:45;19:48;"Yesterday was sucking and tomorrow's looking bad."
19:48;19:51;"And today was the only thing I had."
19:51;19:53;"Well, should we talk about ""Subway""?"
19:53;19:56;"Oh, wait, Jake, as we transition into the ""Subway"" segment,"
19:56;20:00;"and I can't wait to hear everything you've learned from reading the ""Subway"" book,"
20:00;20:04;"it makes me wonder, all these hours in the hospital waiting,"
20:04;20:08;"and, you know, I'm sure Hannah probably had to rest a lot."
20:08;20:12;"Are you just, like, scrolling your phone the whole time?"
20:12;20:14;"Are you, like, taking down some big books?"
20:14;20:16;"Are you rereading the ""Subway"" book?"
20:16;20:18;"I did not bring the ""Subway"" book."
20:18;20:23;"I did bring a book that Nick recommended that I read most of,"
20:23;20:27;"""The Big Goodbye"" is the name of it, right, Nick? Isn't that what it's called?"
20:27;20:30;"Yeah, ""The Making of Chinatown,"" the movie."
20:30;20:37;"I thought I recommended ""To the Thread"" as a TC Book Club companion to ""Chaos,"""
20:37;20:41;"'cause I felt they sort of had a bit of a--"
20:41;20:43;"Oh, yeah, I want to check that out."
20:43;20:47;"- No, it's a good book. - '70s film vibes."
20:47;20:49;"Yeah, it's just about the making of that movie,"
20:49;20:52;"and the Polanski, Robert Evans, Robert Towne,"
20:52;20:57;"who's the other character, I'm forgetting, but, yeah, it's a cool book."
20:57;20:59;"I took down most of that when I was there."
20:59;21:02;"- Obviously looking at the phone, too. - Right."
21:02;21:04;"I've just started a new book now that I'm a new dad."
21:04;21:07;"- What's that? - ""World War Z."""
21:07;21:09;"Oh, like the movie that they made a movie of?"
21:09;21:12;"Yeah, I loved the movie, and then I was reading--"
21:12;21:14;"I saw some blurb about the book recently,"
21:14;21:20;"and the blurb made the book sound like it was this highly detailed"
21:20;21:24;"oral history of this zombie pandemic."
21:24;21:27;"It goes into insane logistics of the economics, the politics,"
21:27;21:29;"- obviously the military. - Whoa."
21:29;21:32;"And just insane survivalist stuff"
21:32;21:37;"told by dozens of different people from around the world."
21:37;21:40;"- I've read the first 50 pages today, loving it. - It's gripping."
21:40;21:43;"I don't really ever read sci-fi stuff."
21:43;21:46;"This is maybe the first sci-fi book I've ever read."
21:46;21:50;"This also sounds like something we might have talked about on TC before,"
21:50;21:54;"but I've always been interested in the difference between hard and soft sci-fi."
21:54;21:57;"You know, soft sci-fi can be kind of just like,"
21:57;22:02;"vibey takes place in the future, but it's still about emotions and relationships."
22:02;22:06;"And hard sci-fi, as I understand it,"
22:06;22:09;"has a high degree of technical detail,"
22:09;22:13;"where people-- there's a lot of readers who don't want to just be like,"
22:13;22:15;"""Then he said goodbye and jumped on the hover jet."""
22:15;22:18;"They want to know how stuff works,"
22:18;22:20;"and some of which I imagine is logistical."
22:20;22:22;"That's like, ""How do the flying cars work?"""
22:22;22:25;"And it's like, ""Well, they found a very specific mineral"
22:25;22:28;"in a mining colony in a distant solar system."""
22:28;22:31;"But I can also imagine kind of a middle ground."
22:31;22:33;"We should make a compilation of this,"
22:33;22:35;"where it's kind of like in that movie Ad Astra,"
22:35;22:38;"how there's an Applebee's on the moon that we talked about."
22:38;22:42;"It's not hard in terms of being technical,"
22:42;22:44;"but it's also not fully soft."
22:44;22:49;"It's just very detailed in terms of business logistics and bureaucracy."
22:49;22:53;"I think World War Z almost feels like hard poly-sci-fi."
22:53;22:57;"Because it's more about how different countries react."
22:57;22:58;"I like poly-sci-fi."
22:58;23:01;"It's poly-sci-fi. Pretty hard, too."
23:01;23:04;"Okay, so maybe we need to pioneer corporate food sci-fi."
23:04;23:09;"That's just like, ""Aliens come,"" or ""It takes place 200 years in the future."""
23:09;23:11;"And it's just like a very..."
23:11;23:13;"That'd actually be a tight novel."
23:13;23:16;"Just like Dunkin' Donuts 2150."
23:16;23:20;"And it's just like an insanely dense, detailed story"
23:20;23:24;"of how Dunkin' Donuts survived to the year 2150,"
23:24;23:27;"and how things work in that era."
23:27;23:28;"I wonder if it will."
23:28;23:32;"Did you guys read Jurassic Park, the original Michael Crichton novel?"
23:32;23:33;"Didn't read it, no."
23:33;23:38;"Well, he definitely would infuse his works with multiple pages of the science."
23:38;23:42;"I remember being a kid and just being like, ""Yo, where's the story?"""
23:42;23:46;"This is a lot of DNA, molecular sh*t."
23:46;23:49;"And then I remember reading, ""Oh, it's not even that accurate."""
23:49;23:51;"But I was 12 or something."
23:51;23:53;"Just very descriptive."
23:53;23:58;"Just like, ""As the nucleotides fuse together in the mRNA."""
23:58;24:01;"It was exactly like that for multiple pages."
24:01;24:03;"And then Disclosure, which was made--"
24:03;24:06;"The reverse-- The Demi Moore--"
24:06;24:07;"Do you remember that movie?"
24:07;24:08;"Vaguely."
24:08;24:13;"He got into all sorts of business, org, tech stuff as well."
24:13;24:17;"Anyway, he would have been great to write the Dunkin' Donuts thing,"
24:17;24:19;"but he's no longer with us."
24:19;24:23;"Dunkin' 2150, definitely located in a hospital."
24:23;24:25;"I feel like we have to go--"
24:25;24:27;"Some of us or all of us have to go try out that avocado toast."
24:27;24:28;"Is that out?"
24:28;24:29;"Yes, it's out now."
24:29;24:30;"I haven't tried it yet."
24:30;24:33;"Okay, well, let's circle back."
24:40;24:43;"♪ All I want, words of torture my burning hands ♪"
24:43;24:47;"♪ And I ask for a tongue that's engraved in his land ♪"

25:16;25:17;"- Should we do the Subway stuff?"
25:17;25:19;"- Yeah, let's get into Subway."
25:19;25:20;"- So I was inspired by Ezra"
25:20;25:22;"after he picked up the Robert Rosenberg book."
25:22;25:25;"I looked online and I found"
25:25;25:29;"Start Small, Finish Big by Fred DeLuca,"
25:29;25:31;"who was the co-founder of Subway."
25:31;25:33;"And it's similar to the Robert Rosenberg book,"
25:33;25:35;"I think in the sense that the bulk of it"
25:35;25:39;"is like advice for would-be entrepreneurs."
25:39;25:41;"But there is a very detailed chapter in here"
25:41;25:43;"called My Story."
25:43;25:44;"And I thought I would just do sort of more"
25:44;25:48;"of like a reading series from Fred DeLuca's book."
25:48;25:49;"- Love it."
25:49;25:50;"- The chapter is actually called"
25:50;25:52;"So I Hear You Make Sandwiches."
25:52;25:56;"This story could have happened to almost anyone, anywhere."
25:56;25:58;"Carmela Hombres and Salvatore DeLuca"
25:58;26:02;"just so happened to live in Brooklyn in the 1940s."
26:02;26:05;"One day they met and not long after, they were married."
26:05;26:08;"1947, they had a son and that was me."
26:08;26:10;"For the first several years of my life,"
26:10;26:13;"we lived in the basement apartment of a two-family house."
26:13;26:14;"It was a humble, low-rent apartment,"
26:14;26:17;"something that newlyweds could afford."
26:17;26:19;"When I was five, we moved to the Bronx to a new development"
26:19;26:22;"which everyone called The Projects."
26:22;26:23;"It was public housing,"
26:23;26:25;"one of the many similar developments"
26:25;26:27;"built after World War II."
26:27;26:29;"For the DeLuca family, it was a setup."
26:29;26:33;"When I was 10, my dad's employer, Empire Devices,"
26:33;26:36;"moved his manufacturing facility to Bridgeport, Connecticut."
26:36;26:39;"And that's where we met Pete Buck and his wife, Heidi,"
26:39;26:41;"who soon became close friends."
26:41;26:44;"One Sunday in July 1965,"
26:44;26:46;"we were invited to visit the Bucks' home"
26:46;26:49;"and enjoy a family barbecue."
26:49;26:50;"That was the day Pete and I formed a business relationship"
26:50;26:52;"that would eventually make a huge impact"
26:52;26:54;"in the fast food industry."
26:54;26:55;"I had just graduated from high school"
26:55;26:57;"and my only real concern was to figure out"
26:57;26:59;"how to pay for college."
26:59;27:01;"But in the summer of 1965,"
27:01;27:03;"there wasn't much hope that I could get through college"
27:03;27:05;"because my family simply didn't have the money."
27:05;27:08;"I worked at a local hardware store as a stock clerk,"
27:08;27:11;"earning $1.25, the minimum wage."
27:11;27:12;"The more I thought about college,"
27:12;27:15;"the more I wondered about how I could find the money."
27:15;27:17;"As we pulled into Pete's driveway, it occurred to me,"
27:17;27:19;"I might ask Pete for some advice."
27:19;27:21;"The Bucks lived in a large white house"
27:21;27:23;"built on three quarters of an acre,"
27:23;27:26;"which seemed to me like a sprawling property."
27:26;27:28;"I was really impressed when I saw the two-car garage"
27:28;27:30;"with two cars parked inside."
27:30;27:32;"Pete must've landed himself a great job,"
27:32;27:34;"one that paid a lot of money, I thought to myself."
27:34;27:36;"It was late afternoon when I saw the opportunity"
27:36;27:39;"to talk privately with Pete in the backyard."
27:39;27:41;"As Pete and I stood in the middle of his green lawn,"
27:41;27:44;"I said, ""Pete, I want to go to college"
27:44;27:45;"""at the University of Bridgeport,"
27:45;27:47;"""but I don't have the money."
27:47;27:49;"""And I was wondering if you'd had any ideas"
27:49;27:53;"""how I might get the money to pay my way through school."""
27:53;27:56;"Pete looked at me and without hesitation, he said,"
27:56;27:59;"""I think you should open a submarine sandwich shop."""
27:59;28:00;"What?"
28:00;28:03;"Of all the possible answers, this was not what I expected."
28:03;28:06;"What an odd thing to say to a 17-year-old kid,"
28:06;28:09;"especially one who came from a modest home"
28:09;28:12;"where no one ever owned any businesses."
28:12;28:15;"Pete explained the submarine sandwich business very simply."
28:15;28:18;"He said that all you had to do was rent a small store,"
28:18;28:22;"build a counter, buy some food, and open it for business."
28:22;28:25;"Customers would then come into the restaurant"
28:25;28:27;"and put their money on the counter."
28:27;28:29;"To Pete, it was just as simple as that,"
28:29;28:31;"although Pete had never owned a business"
28:31;28:33;"nor run a sandwich shop himself."
28:33;28:35;"Thinking now about our conversation,"
28:35;28:36;"it's almost unbelievable."
28:36;28:39;"We were just two guys in a Sunday afternoon barbecue"
28:39;28:41;"speculating, really, about something we knew"
28:41;28:43;"very little to nothing about,"
28:43;28:47;"which is very in keeping with the TC theme."
28:47;28:50;"Guys hanging out on a Sunday speculating about things--"
28:50;28:52;"- Talking about something they know nothing about."
28:52;28:54;"- They know nothing about."
28:54;28:59;"Yeah, and then, so Pete goes on to tell Fred"
28:59;29:03;"about a small chain of sandwich shops in upstate New York"
29:03;29:06;"called Mike's Submarine Sandwiches,"
29:06;29:09;"which had opened 32 restaurants in 10 years."
29:09;29:13;"And so at that point, Peter Buck, also a great name--"
29:13;29:15;"- Wait, is that the same as the R.E.M. guitarist?"
29:15;29:17;"- Yeah, exactly."
29:17;29:21;"Peter Buck and Fred DeLuca formed a business relationship"
29:21;29:24;"that day in the summer of '65,"
29:24;29:25;"where their plan from the outset"
29:25;29:28;"was to open 32 restaurants in 10 years."
29:28;29:32;"And then the book, it goes into enormous detail"
29:32;29:33;"about opening the first few restaurants,"
29:33;29:35;"and it was definitely a struggle."
29:35;29:37;"- What you just read is unbelievable."
29:37;29:41;"It's like, either he's leaving out part of the story"
29:41;29:44;"'cause he doesn't want other entrepreneurs to know,"
29:44;29:46;"or I guess what maybe is more likely is just"
29:46;29:51;"that truly is how crazy the world is."
29:51;29:54;"Like, every once in a while, just like,"
29:54;29:57;"somebody has a weird idea."
29:57;29:58;"It's not even an original idea."
29:58;30:00;"It's like, just--"
30:00;30:01;"- No."
30:01;30:02;"- Also, the fact that it's like a dude"
30:02;30:05;"asking for advice on how to pay for college,"
30:05;30:07;"it's such a weird answer to the question,"
30:07;30:09;"where he's like, ""You know, I was recently"
30:09;30:11;"in upstate New York where I saw a chain"
30:11;30:14;"of 32 submarine sandwich shops."
30:14;30:15;"I think you should open a chain"
30:15;30:17;"of 32 submarine sandwich shops."""
30:17;30:22;"Does he explain elsewhere what Pete saw in this chain"
30:22;30:26;"that made him feel like it was a great business opportunity?"
30:26;30:28;"- Well, I think it was, if this guy can do it, we can do it."
30:28;30:30;"Wait, hold on, I have--"
30:30;30:34;"- There's literally nothing to learn from his story."
30:34;30:35;"- Oh, absolutely not."
30:35;30:39;"When Pete finished reading the article,"
30:39;30:42;"he looked up at us and wondered if Mike Davis can do this."
30:42;30:45;"Mike Davis is the guy that owned Mike's Submarine Sandwiches."
30:45;30:47;"There was an article in the paper about him."
30:47;30:49;"He started with almost nothing to create a mini empire"
30:49;30:52;"in upstate New York of subway sandwich shops."
30:52;30:53;"When Pete finished reading the article,"
30:53;30:54;"he looked up at us and wondered"
30:54;30:57;"if Michael Davis can do this, why can't we?"
30:57;31:00;"I now know that the question didn't come out by accident."
31:00;31:02;"Pete wanted to set a long-term goal"
31:02;31:04;"beyond the opening of one store."
31:04;31:05;"When no one can think of a reason"
31:05;31:08;"why we couldn't perform as well as Michael Davis,"
31:08;31:10;"we began discussing what we could accomplish."
31:10;31:13;"That's how we set a goal to build 32 restaurants"
31:13;31:17;"in 10 years, which they did not meet."
31:17;31:17;"- Oh, really?"
31:17;31:21;"- They were at like 28 or something by 1975."
31:21;31:22;"- He never went to college?"
31:22;31:25;"He just went full-time into the business?"
31:25;31:26;"- Yeah, exactly."
31:26;31:28;"So I could read a little more."
31:28;31:29;"- Please."
31:29;31:30;"- Later years, as we celebrated"
31:30;31:33;"Subway's 10th anniversary in 1975,"
31:33;31:36;"the fact that we were several restaurants shy of our goal"
31:36;31:37;"wasn't much of a disappointment."
31:37;31:38;"We knew it was only a matter of time"
31:38;31:41;"until we would surpass that goal and set a new one."
31:41;31:44;"We opened our 32nd restaurant in 1976."
31:44;31:48;"And in two years, we opened our 100th restaurant."
31:48;31:51;"And by 82, we had doubled our network to 200 restaurants."
31:51;31:53;"The rapid growth created numerous challenges"
31:53;31:56;"that required the resolve of our talented home office team."
31:56;31:58;"So now what do we do?"
31:58;31:59;"How are we doing?"
31:59;32:01;"Was 200 restaurants a lot or a little?"
32:01;32:03;"What else was possible?"
32:03;32:05;"If we set another goal, what would it be?"
32:05;32:07;"After conducting a market study"
32:07;32:09;"of the fast food industry in 1982,"
32:09;32:11;"sizing up other chains and their growth"
32:11;32:13;"and considering Subway's growth,"
32:13;32:18;"I decided our new goal would be 5,000 restaurants by 1994."
32:18;32:20;"It was an aggressive goal."
32:20;32:23;"Most of our employees were stunned when I announced it."
32:23;32:25;"And some of them thought I was absolutely crazy."
32:25;32:27;"We have only 200 restaurants."
32:27;32:29;"How are we gonna open 4,800 more?"
32:29;32:31;"From the perspective of many of our team members,"
32:31;32:34;"it seemed impossible to grow Subway 25-fold."
32:34;32:35;"But from my perspective,"
32:35;32:38;"it looked like an extremely challenging objective,"
32:38;32:39;"but not much more challenging"
32:39;32:41;"than opening 32 restaurants in 10 years,"
32:41;32:44;"which I don't understand at all."
32:44;32:45;"(laughing)"
32:47;32:51;"♪ Got me on my knees ♪"
32:51;32:56;"♪ I'm thinking darling please ♪"
32:56;33:01;"♪ Darling won't you please not worry about me ♪"
33:01;33:04;"- Obviously, these guys sound like they knew nothing"
33:04;33:07;"other than they somewhat looked down on Mike Davis."
33:07;33:09;"If this (beep) Mike Davis character can do it,"
33:09;33:10;"why can't we?"
33:10;33:11;"- We could do it."
33:11;33:12;"- They have no original idea."
33:12;33:14;"And also, they just arbitrarily look"
33:14;33:17;"at what Mike Davis accomplished, 32 restaurants,"
33:17;33:18;"and they just say, ""(beep) it,"
33:18;33:20;"""we'll do 32 restaurants in 10 years."""
33:20;33:22;"It seems so arbitrary, and yet,"
33:22;33:24;"based on what you just read,"
33:24;33:26;"32 was somehow the magic number."
33:26;33:28;"When they finally got to 32,"
33:28;33:31;"then the curve went crazy."
33:31;33:32;"So I guess if anybody,"
33:32;33:34;"that is a big lesson for entrepreneurs,"
33:34;33:38;"is that the first 32 sub shops are the hardest."
33:38;33:41;"And the second you get to 33,"
33:41;33:42;"then you're printing money."
33:42;33:44;"From 33-- - It's off to the races."
33:44;33:47;"- 33 to 5,000 is actually pretty easy."
33:47;33:50;"Zero to 32, that's the danger zone."
33:50;33:53;"- 'Cause after that, they blow through all their goals."
33:53;33:55;"They meet all their goals years early."
33:55;33:57;"When we passed our 8,000 store mark,"
33:57;34:00;"we decided it was time to publish a different type of goal."
34:00;34:03;"Now, rather than measuring how many restaurants we opened,"
34:03;34:06;"we decided to concentrate on cents per capita"
34:06;34:08;"in North America."
34:08;34:10;"Our goal was for every man, woman, and child"
34:10;34:14;"to spend 50 cents per week at Subway by 2005."
34:14;34:16;"(laughing)"
34:16;34:20;"- They wanted every human in America to spend 50 cents?"
34:20;34:25;"- They wanted every person to spend $26.50 annually"
34:25;34:26;"at Subway."
34:26;34:29;"- Do you think you've spent $26.50 annually"
34:29;34:32;"at Subway in your life on average?"
34:32;34:34;"- I haven't been to Subway in 15 years."
34:34;34:36;"- I could imagine a couple-- - There was a period."
34:36;34:38;"- Yeah, me too. - There was a period."
34:38;34:39;"- There's a period I might've hit that."
34:39;34:40;"- Like early tours."
34:40;34:42;"Like we're hitting a truck stop"
34:42;34:45;"in Twin Falls, Idaho. - Right."
34:45;34:48;"- I'm gonna get the veggie delight footlong."
34:48;34:49;"- Yeah, classic."
34:49;34:53;"- From like the gas station, Flying J, Subway."
34:53;34:57;"You know, I probably spent like between 50 and 100 bucks"
34:57;34:58;"those years."
34:58;35:00;"- Regular chips or baked?"
35:00;35:02;"- Sun chips, yeah."
35:02;35:03;"The sun chips."
35:03;35:05;"- Oh God, that's such a (beep) meal."
35:05;35:06;"I got like-- - Yeah."
35:06;35:09;"- I like elements of Subway sandwiches,"
35:09;35:12;"but at least at McDonald's, the burger, the fries,"
35:12;35:15;"and the Coke, it's like a balanced meal."
35:15;35:17;"It works together."
35:17;35:18;"It makes sense to me."
35:18;35:22;"There's something about just like being at Subway."
35:22;35:24;"I feel, also, wait, am I tripping?"
35:24;35:27;"Does Subway have fountain soda"
35:27;35:29;"or do you usually get it from the cooler?"
35:29;35:31;"- Old school definitely had fountain soda."
35:31;35:33;"Like I said, I haven't been in the Subway in many years,"
35:33;35:35;"so I could see them,"
35:35;35:37;"'cause I feel like a lot of Subways are small now"
35:37;35:38;"where it's kind of mostly carryout,"
35:38;35:40;"but like the old school like--"
35:40;35:42;"- Yeah, some of them must have."
35:42;35:45;"But anyway, just when I picture like a Subway meal"
35:45;35:49;"where it's like the sandwich, a bag of chips,"
35:49;35:53;"and like a Coke in a plastic bottle or something,"
35:53;35:54;"there's just no balance there."
35:54;35:57;"That's like a terrible, I mean, of course,"
35:57;35:58;"what are they gonna, they're not gonna start having"
35:58;36:00;"like side salads or something,"
36:00;36:02;"but there's just something about like,"
36:02;36:04;"I always kind of felt like, keep the chips."
36:04;36:05;"I've always hated that."
36:05;36:07;"I've always just hated sandwich and a bag of chips."
36:07;36:11;"That's also a classic like institutional lunch."
36:11;36:12;"- I mean, I was doing the bag of chips"
36:12;36:14;"at Huntington Hospital, let me tell you."
36:14;36:15;"- Oh, were they bringing a bag of chips"
36:15;36:16;"with all your sandwiches?"
36:16;36:17;"- What sort of chips?"
36:17;36:20;"Doritos? - No, just a Lay's, no."
36:20;36:21;"- It's a classic regular?"
36:21;36:23;"- It's like turkey sandwich with a bag of Lay's."
36:23;36:25;"- Just the yellow Lay's?"
36:25;36:26;"- Yellow Lay's, straight up."
36:26;36:29;"- Subway water is Dasani."
36:29;36:30;"- Well, of course."
36:30;36:31;"- Yeah. - Disgraceful."
36:31;36:33;"- A plastic bottle of Dasani,"
36:33;36:38;"a Subway turkey sub and just a bag of plain Lay's."
36:38;36:39;"Jesus Christ."
36:39;36:42;"- $7.89."
36:42;36:45;"- I feel like roasted tomato sun chips."
36:45;36:46;"- Oh man."
36:46;36:50;"- Don't forget the cookies that taste like the bread"
36:50;36:52;"'cause they absorb the bread fumes."
36:52;36:55;"That was always a treat."
36:55;36:57;"- Oh yeah, the cookie."
36:57;36:58;"That's even crazier."
36:58;36:59;"- What's that?"
36:59;37:00;"- Sandwich chips and a cookie."
37:00;37:01;"- Oh."
37:03;37:04;"I've always felt this way."
37:04;37:06;"Even back in the '90s,"
37:06;37:08;"the phrase all that in a bag of chips."
37:08;37:10;"I was always just kind of like, ugh."
37:10;37:12;"- Sir, if you get the drink and the chips,"
37:12;37:13;"it's actually less money"
37:13;37:15;"than just ordering the sandwich out of the cart."
37:15;37:16;"It's fine."
37:16;37:17;"Fine."
37:17;37:19;"- Keep your sun chips."
37:19;37:24;"Sun chips and Dasani are two of the biggest scams out there."
37:24;37:26;"The sandwich is kind of like the purest part"
37:26;37:29;"of what's happening, but yeah, Dasani is brutal."
37:29;37:31;"Sun chips, just like,"
37:31;37:33;"yeah, 'cause sun chips are so sad"
37:33;37:34;"because they don't taste bad,"
37:34;37:38;"but it's like this vague gesture towards nature"
37:38;37:42;"or something healthy, but so like, ugh."
37:42;37:43;"- Nature."
37:43;37:43;"That's funny."
37:43;37:45;"That's like, if you're gonna do chips,"
37:45;37:47;"just go nacho cheese Doritos."
37:47;37:49;"- Absolutely."
37:49;37:50;"- Stop jerking me around."
37:50;37:52;"(laughing)"
37:52;37:54;"The last thing I will say from this book,"
37:54;37:59;"and this kind of circles back to your economic sci-fi fantasy"
37:59;38:02;"about Duncan 2150."
38:02;38:06;"He feels very confident that by the year 2050,"
38:06;38:09;"a large fast food company will be able to operate"
38:09;38:11;"more than 100,000 outlets."
38:11;38:12;"- Whoa."
38:12;38:14;"- Well, how many are there right now?"
38:14;38:17;"- Well, I think Subway, there's like 40,000 something."
38:17;38:21;"I feel like Subway is the most prolific of the chains."
38:21;38:25;"- Yeah, it's 41,600 Subway locations worldwide,"
38:25;38:28;"down from 42,431 in 2019."
38:28;38:30;"They've cut back a little bit."
38:30;38:31;"- I was gonna say, I think they're leveling off."
38:31;38:33;"- Right, well, COVID year is tough."
38:33;38:36;"- I'm very skeptical of that 100,000 outlets."
38:36;38:39;"Although 2050 is quite a long ways off."
38:39;38:41;"- It would make sense if they stay,"
38:41;38:43;"keep growing at the current rate."
38:43;38:45;"- But I think the curve is leveling."
38:45;38:47;"- Yeah, you'd have to imagine."
38:47;38:48;"- Yeah."
38:48;38:50;"- Are there a lot of Subways in China?"
38:50;38:52;"'Cause like, you know, we know that that accounts"
38:52;38:54;"for so much of like Starbucks growth."
38:54;38:56;"- Yeah, there's gotta be."
38:56;38:57;"- It seems like that's how it always is"
38:57;38:58;"for these corporations."
38:58;39:00;"It's always about new markets."
39:01;39:04;"Like the US is a mature sub market."
39:04;39:07;"They've kind of probably reached more or less"
39:07;39:08;"full saturation."
39:08;39:09;"Although, who knows?"
39:09;39:10;"Maybe--"
39:10;39:11;"- Oversaturation."
39:11;39:13;"- Yeah, I guess what they might be hoping for"
39:13;39:15;"is also their rivals to fall"
39:15;39:18;"because a big part of Dunkin's growth"
39:18;39:22;"and part of the cathartic ending of the donut wars"
39:22;39:25;"for the Rosenberg and Winokur families"
39:25;39:29;"was when Dunkin Donuts ended up purchasing"
39:29;39:31;"all the rest of the North American Mr. Donuts"
39:31;39:33;"and then turning them into Dunkin's."
39:33;39:37;"So maybe that's like, that could be like a end phase"
39:37;39:39;"for Subway is like, I don't know how Quiznos"
39:39;39:41;"is doing these days."
39:41;39:44;"Jersey Mike's seems to be thriving actually,"
39:44;39:48;"but maybe one day if like their finances get messy,"
39:48;39:51;"Subway could buy up all the Jersey Mike's,"
39:51;39:53;"convert them and that would like,"
39:53;39:54;"might put them over the top."
39:54;39:56;"That could be another few thousand or something."
39:56;39:59;"Plus new and emerging sub markets."
39:59;40:02;"- I'm on Quora, the question and answer website"
40:02;40:05;"and there's an anecdote from two years ago"
40:05;40:09;"from a civil engineer in China who said,"
40:09;40:12;"""About five years ago, Subway opened three restaurants"
40:12;40:13;"""in my city in China."
40:13;40:16;"""My city is a third tier city by some reckoning,"
40:16;40:18;"""perhaps a fourth tier city."""
40:18;40:20;"Anyway, I won't bore you with the details,"
40:20;40:23;"but it seems like from this person's perspective,"
40:24;40:29;"the Chinese interpretation of how a Subway is received,"
40:29;40:32;"like a Subway sandwich is received in China"
40:32;40:35;"is that it's regarded as actually a hamburger."
40:35;40:38;"Sandwiches are most commonly recognized"
40:38;40:42;"as a triangular shape, sort of like your classic,"
40:42;40:45;"like what your mom might prepare for you at lunch."
40:45;40:46;"- A slice of bread."
40:46;40:48;"- Right, a slice of bread, right."
40:48;40:53;"And the hoagie is interpreted more as a burger"
40:53;40:56;"and burgers are associated with unhealthy eating."
40:56;41:00;"So there's like, and again, this is one person's testimony,"
41:00;41:03;"but it seems like it's sort of--"
41:03;41:05;"Yeah, it seems like just anecdotally"
41:05;41:08;"kind of missing the mark as far as what Subway is known for."
41:08;41:10;"- Right, well, especially when you consider"
41:10;41:13;"that big part of Subway's explosive growth"
41:13;41:15;"was the decline of McDonald's"
41:15;41:18;"and Subway making this big push to be like,"
41:18;41:19;"""We're a healthy fast food,"
41:19;41:21;"""you're stuffing your face with burgers."""
41:21;41:24;"And maybe it's not a failure of marketing,"
41:24;41:25;"maybe just the people in this third"
41:25;41:27;"or fourth tier city in China,"
41:27;41:31;"they're not beholden to our bizarre cultural norms"
41:31;41:33;"and they can see right through this bull (beep)"
41:33;41:34;"and they're just like,"
41:34;41:37;"""You're trying to present this as eating fresh?"
41:37;41:40;"""This is just another disgusting American chain."
41:40;41:42;"""This is no different than McDonald's"
41:42;41:43;"""and we're not falling for it."""
41:43;41:47;"- I found this article from Reuters in 2010"
41:47;41:50;"that says Subway eyes, this is about 11 years ago,"
41:50;41:54;"Subway eyes matching McDonald's in China in 10 years."
41:54;41:56;"And they're really like, ""We're going for it."""
41:56;41:59;"And they miss the mark."
41:59;42:02;"What I think is interesting is how competitive they seem."
42:02;42:06;"It's very like Michael Jordan, ""Last Dance."""
42:06;42:09;"They're like, ""We don't like Jersey Mike's."
42:09;42:10;"""We're going after Jersey Mike's."
42:10;42:13;"""We're gonna go after their numbers."""
42:13;42:14;"But yeah, clearly they miss it."
42:14;42:16;"But there is something kind of interesting."
42:16;42:19;"It's like the opposite of Dunkin'."
42:20;42:21;"It's not cool."
42:21;42:24;"You know, it's very--"
42:24;42:26;"- Yeah, Subway is not cool."
42:26;42:28;"- It's not kind at all."
42:28;42:29;"It's not cool."
42:29;42:30;"- They've had a rough run."
42:30;42:33;"I mean, let's not forget the rise and fall of Jared Fogle."
42:33;42:34;"- Of course."
42:34;42:34;"- I mean, that was rough."
42:34;42:37;"And then recently there was the whole"
42:37;42:39;"tuna or not tuna snafu,"
42:39;42:41;"which Subway pushed back on very hard."
42:41;42:44;"- Well, also, I think I talked about this on TC once."
42:44;42:45;"I read an article that was,"
42:45;42:49;"this is like a little more in the weeds,"
42:49;42:51;"but still important nonetheless."
42:51;42:53;"There was a investigative article,"
42:53;42:55;"I think in the New York Times,"
42:55;42:59;"that implied that Subway was kind of like"
42:59;43:01;"being really (beep) to their franchisees,"
43:01;43:04;"which is very much not the Dunkin' way, supposedly,"
43:04;43:07;"where they value their franchisees as part of the family."
43:07;43:09;"It basically was like a story of how"
43:09;43:12;"they could use the blood, sweat, and tears"
43:12;43:15;"of a franchisee who tries to build a Dunkin',"
43:15;43:17;"but then by hitting them,"
43:17;43:21;"dinging them with arbitrary violations,"
43:21;43:24;"they could then take the restaurant back"
43:24;43:26;"to the mothership, so to speak."
43:26;43:29;"So, imagine you dedicated your whole life to a Subway,"
43:29;43:31;"you sunk your life savings into it,"
43:31;43:33;"and then they send somebody from corporate"
43:33;43:35;"a few times a year, and they're just like,"
43:35;43:37;"""That light bulb was not screwed in properly."
43:37;43:41;"""Two more violations, and we'll take your license away."""
43:41;43:43;"That's kind of what the article implied."
43:43;43:45;"But I'm only half remembering it,"
43:45;43:46;"so don't quote me on it."

45:32;45:34;"There's something about Subway where it just feels like,"
45:34;45:36;"I know they're always, they have special sandwiches,"
45:36;45:38;"but it just feels like, who gives a (beep)"
45:38;45:40;"just like open a Subway."
45:40;45:42;"I feel like Subway gets most of their customers"

46:52;46:54;"on some questions regarding professional tasters"
46:54;46:56;"and how to find them."
46:56;46:57;"While obviously not on Duncan's level,"
46:57;46:59;"not a food manufacturer,"
46:59;47:00;"I figured that a brief overview"
47:00;47:04;"from inside Colorado's biggest craft brewery"
47:04;47:06;"might help clear a couple things up for yourselves"
47:06;47:09;"and other listeners about how tasters are usually created."
47:09;47:11;"I'd never even heard of this as a job."
47:11;47:13;"When I'm picturing the Dunkin' Donuts story,"
47:13;47:15;"it sounded like he just picked people"
47:15;47:18;"with other jobs in the office just to weigh in."
47:18;47:20;"Okay, so here's where Trevor explains his job."
47:20;47:23;"I, along with a small team, among other things,"
47:23;47:25;"run a daily taste panel at the brewery,"
47:25;47:27;"which involves sample evaluation"
47:27;47:30;"for approximately 20 trained tasters."
47:30;47:32;"To put it bluntly, all of our panelists and technicians"
47:32;47:34;"drink beer each morning."
47:34;47:35;"Tight. - Wow."
47:35;47:36;"- From each batch, a finished product"
47:36;47:40;"to determine if our beers contain any number of off flavors"
47:40;47:42;"and make sure they're true to brand."
47:42;47:43;"In beer at any brewery,"
47:43;47:45;"this could be anything from slight amounts of onion"
47:45;47:48;"or fruity aromas that shouldn't be in a specific brand"
47:48;47:50;"to more serious fermentation issues"
47:50;47:53;"that produce aromas of DMS, creamed corn,"
47:53;47:57;"mercaptan, rotting garbage, isovaleric,"
47:57;48:00;"sweaty socks, among a million others."
48:00;48:01;"I guess he's saying-- - What the hell?"
48:01;48:04;"- I guess he's naming the chemical"
48:04;48:07;"and saying what it tastes like to a professional taster."
48:07;48:09;"This daily tasting allows us to put out world-class beer"
48:09;48:10;"in the hands of our customers each day"
48:10;48:12;"with a clear conscience."
48:12;48:14;"You know, I guess the same way that you see footage"
48:14;48:16;"of somebody in a factory where there's people"
48:16;48:19;"just checking every little thing all day."
48:19;48:22;"You know, sometimes a robot can do that too,"
48:22;48:27;"just to push out any deformed M&M or something."
48:27;48:30;"I guess it makes sense the only way just to, every day,"
48:30;48:32;"be testing these huge batches of beer"
48:32;48:35;"and make sure you're not about to go send,"
48:35;48:38;"you know, thousands of skunked brews out"
48:38;48:41;"would be to have human beings do it."
48:41;48:43;"Says, ""Hopefully I don't get too far in the weeds,"
48:43;48:45;"""but what we do is find willing participants"
48:45;48:47;"""in the company, literally anyone,"
48:47;48:48;"""to first go through a set of online trainings"
48:48;48:51;"""in order to provide them with beer-specific knowledge"
48:51;48:53;"""and then sense knowledge."""
48:53;48:55;"Okay, so it's almost like he's the full-time dude"
48:55;48:58;"and he's taking people from within the company"
48:58;49:00;"to kind of volunteer, I guess."
49:00;49:01;"""We then take these individuals"
49:01;49:04;"""and give them hands-on trainings in our sensory lab."
49:04;49:05;"""They're tasting beers,"
49:05;49:08;"""talking about their characteristics,"
49:08;49:10;"""kind of learning what to look out for,"
49:10;49:13;"""like the sweaty socks chemical."
49:13;49:15;"""After trainings, they get to join our taste program"
49:15;49:17;"""under a provisionary status as not validated"
49:17;49:19;"""until they see a certain number of spiked beers"
49:19;49:22;"""and call them out correctly a certain number of times."""
49:22;49:24;"- Oh, wow. - So this is very serious."
49:24;49:25;"They're like, ""You can't bull (beep)"
49:25;49:26;"""your way through this."""
49:26;49:29;"""We also use tests similar to what Ezra's talking about,"
49:29;49:32;"""where we give them four glasses of two different beers"
49:32;49:34;"""that have relatively similar attributes or spikes"
49:34;49:37;"""and have them group them into two groups"
49:37;49:39;"""of two known as a tetrad test."""
49:39;49:42;"Okay, this is serious."
49:42;49:43;"""While I'm sure it varies from company to company,"
49:43;49:46;"""regardless of food, beverage, manufacturer,"
49:46;49:48;"""statistical analysis of tasting performance"
49:48;49:50;"""is the main way you can validate tasters"
49:50;49:52;"""in order to know you're putting high-quality products"
49:52;49:54;"""in the market consistently."
49:54;49:55;"""Sorry for the rant, but I tend to geek out"
49:55;49:56;"""on some of this stuff,"
49:56;49:58;"""which is why I love my job so much."""
49:58;50:03;"That is that type of job that is so specific"
50:03;50:05;"that it's like, if you're the type of person"
50:05;50:10;"who cares about chemistry, beer, and customer satisfaction,"
50:10;50:13;"it truly is a dream job."
50:13;50:15;"- Plus, when you're at the bar on a Friday night"
50:15;50:16;"and someone's like, ""What do you do, man?"""
50:16;50:19;"You're like, ""I taste beer for a living, man."""
50:19;50:22;"- Hanging out at the barbecue, talking to some random dude."
50:22;50:27;"We'll let some guy who just works in mid-level management"
50:28;50:31;"at an accounting firm, ""What about you, man?"""
50:31;50:33;"""Well, I'm a sensory technician."""
50:33;50:36;"""Bro, you're telling me you taste beer for a living?"""
50:36;50:38;"- It's like professional gamers or something."
50:38;50:39;"- Kind of."
50:39;50:40;"- I mean, that makes a lot of sense."
50:40;50:44;"I mean, I would think there'd be,"
50:44;50:46;"like the flavors with a microbrewer"
50:46;50:48;"would be so subtle and precise."
50:48;50:49;"- Right. - There'd be very little"
50:49;50:51;"variation that would be acceptable,"
50:51;50:52;"which again, like you were saying about Subway,"
50:52;50:54;"it doesn't matter."
50:54;50:56;"There's the bread, which is the same,"
50:56;50:59;"has that same perfumey kind of sweetness every time."
50:59;51:01;"But everything else is just sort of like,"
51:01;51:03;"yeah, you're getting some tomatoes and some turkey"
51:03;51:05;"and some mayo and mustard."
51:05;51:06;"There's no like variation there really."
51:06;51:09;"Or if there is, it's out of your hands anyway."
51:09;51:13;"- The Subway customer experience is like such a low bar."
51:13;51:15;"Yeah, I don't know if I'm just like putting too much"
51:15;51:17;"of my own personal experience with Subway into it,"
51:17;51:22;"but I just feel like you go to Subway with no expectations"
51:22;51:24;"other than that it's not McDonald's."
51:24;51:27;"It's like you just know it's not gonna be a great sandwich"
51:27;51:30;"if you get one and like that (beep) shredded lettuce"
51:30;51:32;"is like all is like messy in the wrap."
51:32;51:33;"It's like, you don't even complain at Subway."
51:33;51:35;"- It's food, it's function."
51:35;51:36;"- Right, exactly. - Okay,"
51:36;51:37;"here's a tough question."
51:37;51:40;"- Yeah. - Tough question for the show."
51:40;51:43;"If you had to eat at Subway or McDonald's every day"
51:43;51:45;"for the rest of your life, you had to choose one."
51:45;51:46;"Which one?"
51:46;51:49;"Let's say lunch every day, every day."
51:49;51:50;"- Same meal?"
51:50;51:52;"Or you have diversity in-- - No."
51:52;51:54;"You can put whatever you want."
51:54;51:56;"Just lunch, diversity of the menu."
51:56;51:58;"- McDonald's. - McDonald's."
51:58;51:59;"- I think-- - I think a challenge"
51:59;52:01;"at McDonald's. - Yeah, I think actually"
52:01;52:03;"McDonald's, it's a broader menu."
52:03;52:05;"I mean, of course there's a part of me"
52:05;52:08;"that still buys into this idea that Subway is healthier,"
52:08;52:10;"so I could punish myself with a veggie delight."
52:10;52:14;"- Lest I remind the whole crew what I sent"
52:14;52:19;"in the group text, which is they're being sued in Ireland"
52:19;52:22;"because their bread isn't technically bread."
52:22;52:26;"And the tuna, there's a legal battle in the US"
52:26;52:29;"because the tuna isn't technically tuna."
52:29;52:31;"- I'm not sure about the tuna story."
52:31;52:33;"I'm not sure I'd buy that, but the bread"
52:33;52:35;"has a ton of sugar in it for sure."
52:35;52:38;"- You know, I'm, what does that mean that it's not?"
52:38;52:42;"I'm looking at the Subway website now with their menu."
52:42;52:44;"Gotta say, it actually looks pretty good in the pictures."
52:44;52:48;"- I might go Subway in that hypothetical."
52:48;52:50;"- I mean, of course McDonald's would be more fun,"
52:50;52:55;"but okay, looking at Subway, I guess Subway does have salads."
52:55;52:56;"Oh, and they got wraps."
52:56;52:59;"I didn't know, oh, they got protein bowls now?"
52:59;53:00;"Okay, maybe I gotta go back to Subway."
53:00;53:02;"I've been really harsh on it."
53:02;53:05;"Oh, they have a breakfast, Subway has a breakfast menu."
53:05;53:09;"They have these funny kind of flatbread things"
53:09;53:12;"where you could get a bacon, egg, and cheese,"
53:12;53:14;"a black forest ham, egg, and cheese,"
53:14;53:16;"egg and cheese, steak, egg, and cheese."
53:16;53:17;"- You know what?"
53:17;53:20;"I feel like next episode, we all have to get"
53:20;53:22;"the Dunkin' Donuts avocado toast,"
53:22;53:25;"and we all have to get a Subway protein bowl"
53:25;53:27;"and review them."
53:27;53:29;"- Hey, what's the difference between ham"
53:29;53:30;"and black forest ham?"
53:30;53:32;"What makes it black forest?"
53:32;53:33;"- That's a good question."
53:33;53:38;"I mean, I picture black forest ham being dark on the edges."
53:38;53:41;"I guess it comes from the black forest region of Germany."
53:41;53:42;"- It sounds really cool."
53:42;53:45;"- It's a kind of Bavarian preparation of ham."
53:45;53:47;"- It's got ham."
53:47;53:48;"- It's not honey ham."
53:48;53:50;"It's not like a pink American ham."
53:50;53:54;"It's like a dark Bavarian ham"
53:54;53:58;"from the deepest, darkest parts of the black forest."
53:58;54:01;"- I'm picturing that Subway protein bowl being very soggy."
54:01;54:03;"- (laughs) Very soggy?"
54:03;54:06;"- The idea that they're just cutting up the meat,"
54:06;54:08;"like chopping up the thin meat"
54:08;54:10;"to make that the part of the protein."
54:10;54:12;"Do you know, it's so thin."
54:12;54:13;"- This is gross."
54:13;54:14;"Let's, we gotta move on."
54:14;54:16;"(laughs)"
54:16;54:18;"- Approaching slurry levels."
54:18;54:20;"- Yeah, we gotta move on."
54:20;54:22;"- All right, no more Subway bowls."
54:22;54:23;"But it's making me think like,"
54:23;54:27;"I wonder if I've ever had a day in my life,"
54:27;54:29;"and I'm sure many people have,"
54:29;54:33;"where it was Dunkin' for breakfast, Subway for lunch,"
54:33;54:34;"Mickey D's for dinner."
54:34;54:36;"- Oh, damn."
54:36;54:37;"I have not."
54:37;54:38;"- You should probably have some fun with that."
54:38;54:40;"- That's a good challenge though."
54:40;54:42;"Maybe that's the TC challenge."
54:42;54:43;"- Dunkin' for lunch."
54:43;54:44;"- Yeah, what is this?"
54:44;54:45;"This is a pathetic show."
54:45;54:47;"(laughs)"
54:47;54:49;"The TC challenge."
54:49;54:51;"We're basically just,"
54:51;54:53;"it's where, I think sometimes we do hit a place"
54:53;54:55;"with the show where it's like,"
54:55;54:58;"the critical perspective kind of runs"
54:58;55:00;"into the kind vibe side,"
55:00;55:01;"and it just kind of like,"
55:01;55:03;"they fizzle out into just basically"
55:03;55:06;"like a very straight ahead, just like,"
55:06;55:09;"all right gang, if you love fast food as much as we do,"
55:09;55:10;"you should try the TC challenge."
55:10;55:13;"We're doing Dunkin' for breakfast, Subway for lunch,"
55:13;55:14;"Mickey D's for dinner."
55:14;55:16;"Order what you want, but you gotta hit all three."
55:16;55:18;"(laughs)"
55:19;55:20;"- That is so weak."
55:20;55:22;"(laughs)"
55:22;55:26;"I hope, I don't want any listeners to actually do that."
55:26;55:27;"- Yeah, please don't."
55:27;55:28;"- On account of the show."
55:28;55:29;"I'm not gonna do it."
55:29;55:30;"There's no way I'm gonna do that."
55:30;55:33;"- Okay, how about Jake,"
55:33;55:34;"you can pick anyone you want,"
55:34;55:36;"but for one day,"
55:36;55:38;"each meal, breakfast, lunch, and dinner"
55:38;55:40;"has to be a Subway protein bowl."
55:40;55:41;"- Wait, what?"
55:41;55:44;"I have to eat three Subway protein bowls?"
55:44;55:45;"- Yeah, but they have a lot."
55:45;55:46;"So you could do, for instance,"
55:46;55:48;"you could do the Italian-"
55:48;55:50;"- Is there a breakfast bowl?"
55:50;55:52;"- No, but there's a,"
55:52;55:54;"you could do tuna bowl for breakfast,"
55:54;55:57;"meatball marinara for lunch,"
55:57;56:00;"chicken and bacon ranch."
56:00;56:03;"- Oh, ranch is so nasty."
56:03;56:09;"- The TC challenge is that you have to spend $20.14"
56:09;56:12;"annually at Subway."
56:12;56:14;"- Yeah, exactly."
56:15;56:17;"We don't care when you spend it,"
56:17;56:20;"but every year it's a 10-year challenge."
56:20;56:23;"- In honor of the late Fred DeLuca,"
56:23;56:25;"we're challenging all of our listeners"
56:25;56:27;"to hit Fred's financial goals."
56:27;56:28;"- Well, shout out to Subway."
56:28;56:30;"Shout out to Connecticut."
56:30;56:32;"- Connecticut pulling its weight."
56:32;56:35;"Jake, I did an interview with Goose this morning."
56:35;56:36;"- Oh, wow."
56:36;56:37;"- For Relics."
56:37;56:38;"- Cool."
56:38;56:39;"- I guess they're profiling Goose"
56:39;56:40;"and they wanna have a little sidebar thing"
56:40;56:41;"where we'd talk to them."
56:41;56:43;"The journalist from Relics asked,"
56:43;56:44;"had Goose first got on my radar?"
56:44;56:46;"So of course I explained, you know,"
56:46;56:48;"Stephen Hyden called him to the show."
56:48;56:50;"And he's like, so what made you interested in them"
56:50;56:50;"in the first place?"
56:50;56:52;"And I said, well, here's the thing."
56:52;56:54;"My co-host Jake is from Connecticut"
56:54;56:56;"and he often says Connecticut's not pulling its weight."
56:56;56:58;"So it was very exciting to hear about"
56:58;57:02;"a young band from Connecticut making some waves."
57:02;57:03;"Then they were talking about a lot of other bands"
57:03;57:05;"from the Connecticut jam band scene,"
57:05;57:07;"which we should probably go deeper on sometime."
57:07;57:09;"- Also Goose is just a great band name."
57:09;57:10;"I mean, that's such a catch."
57:10;57:11;"- Yes, I said the same thing."
57:11;57:11;"I was like, first of all-"
57:11;57:14;"- You were just like, wait, there's a band called Goose?"
57:14;57:16;"- A jam band called Goose from Connecticut."
57:16;57:20;"Like, that's already 90% of their,"
57:20;57:21;"and then the music's,"
57:21;57:23;"they're actually a great band, even better."

59:55;59:58;"That's TC, we kind of get into that just like deep,"
59:58;01:00:02;"just kind of like dry fast food news."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- Yeah."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"- That's a version of this show that we have to avoid"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"where it is just kind of like,"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"Wendy's announced a new spin on the Baconator."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Jake, you try it?"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"- No, I haven't had the chance yet."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"- Let's say for the next episode,"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"we all try the new chicken Baconator."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"What else, what else?"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"I went to Taco Bell the other day."
01:00:22;01:00:26;"No, but there is legitimately some very TC news happening"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"with Taco Bell dropping what I believe is,"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"one of the first fast food NFTs."
01:00:30;01:00:34;"So who wants to explain what NFTs are?"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I mean, Jake, do you already know?"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"- They're nifty fun toys, right?"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"- Jake spent five days in the hospital when he came out,"
01:00:42;01:00:46;"Taco Bell was making fricking NFTs."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"You're Rip Van Winkle."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"It's like you're in prison for 40 years,"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"come out to a totally new world."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"- Wait a second, corporations are making art,"
01:00:54;01:00:58;"like discreet art objects that you can buy one of a kind?"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"Imagine that, like Taco Bell was sort of like,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"we're having a painting exhibition."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"Well, who did the paintings?"
01:01:05;01:01:08;"Taco Bell did the paintings."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"- I mean, honestly, that is the next phase of like,"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"you know, we've been covering this for years now,"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"but of all like the kind of gimmicky,"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"funny corporate (beep)"
01:01:17;01:01:22;"Oh, like Kentucky Fried Chicken made a lifetime movie."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And somebody else did a, you know, a street wear drop"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"and, you know, McDonald's and Travis Scott's"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"and all this stuff."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"Like maybe it is eventually just getting back"
01:01:29;01:01:33;"to like old school corporate kind of like classy (beep)"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"where it's like not some big kind of viral joke,"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"where it is like Taco Bell has like a serious art collection."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"They exhibit it sometimes, like what?"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"You know, you think that's weird?"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- Oh, that I could see that."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- You think JP Morgan doesn't own a lot of art"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"that they exhibit here and there?"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"And it's like, they kind of lose"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"the millennial zany humor angle"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"and just kind of becomes like,"
01:01:54;01:01:57;"we're a major global corporation."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"We consider part of our mission,"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"not just making money and serving"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"great Mexican inspired cuisine."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"We also consider part of our mission"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"to like enrich people's lives."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"And we're doing a dead ass serious painting exhibition"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"where we're showing some of our collection."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"We paid top dollar from some of the best artists"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"around the world."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"You know, like start acting with like the prestige"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"of like investment banks."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"- LACMA is expanding."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"And one of their things that we're excited about"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"is the new Taco Bell wing."
01:02:24;01:02:25;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- At LACMA."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I could see that."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"- Taco Bell stadium in Idaho, why not?"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"- I was making a weird joke of Taco Bell making,"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"'cause Taco Bell released NFTs, right?"
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Like Taco Bell released art."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"- So first we should actually explain what NFTs are for,"
01:02:39;01:02:42;"'cause this is something that two weeks ago,"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"very few people were talking about."
01:02:43;01:02:47;"And now it's like everyone and their mothers dropping NFTs."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- It's so dumb."
01:02:48;01:02:52;"It screams like tulip bubble, if anything does."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"I mean, it's so funny."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Seinfeld, do you want to jump in?"
01:02:54;01:02:55;"'Cause you had sent that article."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"I mean."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"- Did I send that?"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"I don't think I sent that."
01:02:58;01:03:02;"- Seinfeld, do you feel you can explain?"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- Oh, I can do very high level."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"- I kind of consider you, I mean Seinfeld"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"as our kind of social media person,"
01:03:09;01:03:13;"that kind of makes you also our lead"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"science and technology reporter."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"- Yeah, I definitely consider myself a tech guru."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"- In the crew."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"And I'll tell you also that I did put an NFT"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"for Seinfeld 2008."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- That's right."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"- Yeah, online or what I don't even think it's online,"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"but a couple of weeks ago."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"And let me tell you, it didn't meet the minimum price."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"So somebody bid one ether, which was the minimum reserve."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"And then they withdrew their bid."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"So I was like, oh,"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"'cause then I was looking at the conversion rate"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"and it was like $1,600."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"And I was like, this is the dumbest thing ever."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"Did I just make money out of thin air?"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"And then somebody probably came to their senses"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"and withdrew it before the auction ended."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Anyway, I'm already going on a tangent here."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"NFT on its most basic level is what?"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"It's a digital sort of virtual--"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Token."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- Token, there you go, thank you."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"That represents a piece of artwork."
01:04:06;01:04:09;"And I believe if you purchase one,"
01:04:09;01:04:13;"that sort of makes you the owner of said artwork,"
01:04:13;01:04:17;"even though it's not a physical, tangible art, right?"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"You own the rights to that art online."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"Does that sound--"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"- You don't own the rights."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- No, I hear."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- You own the digital information."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"I mean, it's like cryptocurrency,"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"but this is a crypto art object, right?"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"- It's a way of, from my understanding,"
01:04:31;01:04:34;"non-fungible token is what it obviously it stands for,"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"meaning that you own, it's basically verifiable."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"You own the rights to it."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"So while other people can kind of copy or cut and paste it,"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"just the way you could a painting, right?"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"Like you can sell prints of the painting,"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"but you own the painting, you own that."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"When you buy it, you own it."
01:04:52;01:04:53;"That's what an NFT is."
01:04:53;01:04:58;"So if you were to buy Jake's Blockbuster NFT,"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"you own that."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"So yes, other people can screen share it,"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"they can copy it,"
01:05:03;01:05:07;"but the fundamental verifiable ownership of that"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"is to the person who has purchased it."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"- So theoretically, you could also make money"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"by owning an NFT."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"- If you sold it."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"- No, you don't own the rights."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"- You don't own the rights, okay."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- No, no, no. - You do."
01:05:19;01:05:21;"- Yeah, that's what I thought too."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"- No, you don't."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"- Yes, you do. - If you buy a painting."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"(laughing)"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"- If you buy a painting,"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"you don't own the rights to the painting."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- No, you own the physical object."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"That's all you own."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"And I think it's the same with it."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"With NFT, you own, it truly is like-"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"- It's not fungible. - It's all you're buying."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- Oh, wait, so Jake-"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"- The tokens are not fungible, man."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"- What do you mean?"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"If I bought your painting,"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"I have a painting in my house,"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"you can just take it back?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"- No, you have the object."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"- No, but you can't- - You don't own the image."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"- You can't start printing a- - So you can't sell it."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"- Yeah."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"- You can't start printing up T-shirts."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"- I could."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"- Nick, you don't own the image."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"- I know, yes, you own the object."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"That's, sorry, that is what I'm trying to say."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"So you own that, yes, other people can reprint it,"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"they can cut, copy and paste it,"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"but the actual object itself, the digital object,"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"you have the rights to and-"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"- Exactly. - A blockchain."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"- Well, you don't have the rights to it."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"You own that."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"- You own the digital information."
01:06:13;01:06:16;"- It's an oxymoron because you said the word digital object,"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"which doesn't exist, it makes no sense."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"That's why NFTs, it truly is just bragging rights."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Now, you could make the argument"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"that buying expensive art is similar,"
01:06:25;01:06:28;"but in that case, you actually have a physical object"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"that you can hang on the wall or put into storage"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"or burn if you want."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"But with the NFT, it's literally,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"like you're literally just owning the bragging rights,"
01:06:36;01:06:40;"being like, there's this clip of Michael Jordan dunking"
01:06:40;01:06:43;"that the NBA sold that's on YouTube,"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"but they issued one token."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"- Right. - Which that's all it is."
01:06:46;01:06:47;"It's just like a-"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"- I guess, I mean, this is what I imagine"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"sort of every clubhouse conversation is like right now,"
01:06:52;01:06:55;"but I do think that I don't know the difference"
01:06:55;01:06:59;"between then like having the Mona Lisa"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"and then having a print in your dorm room of the Mona Lisa."
01:07:02;01:07:06;"It's just like, yes, it is all bragging rights, I guess."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"- It's conceptual too, because it's like,"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"if the artist themselves or the rights holder"
01:07:12;01:07:17;"creates one NFT, yeah, you kind of have the bragging rights"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"of saying I bought the one they made."
01:07:20;01:07:23;"So like, for instance, I guess to take it back in the day,"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"if there were NFTs in the time of Da Vinci,"
01:07:25;01:07:29;"and Da Vinci did create one digital version of the Mona Lisa"
01:07:29;01:07:34;"that had a unique place in the ether chain or whatever,"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"you know, like, I guess it might be meaningful"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"if somebody said, oh yeah, the Louvre owns"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"the actual Mona Lisa, but I own the one NFT"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"that Da Vinci created."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"I guess that would probably be valuable today, right?"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"And then you could verify it too."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Somebody's like, are you sure you own the one?"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"And be like, check it out, man, it's in the ledger."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"It's in the ether ledger."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"Yes, I do own it."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"You can follow the chain from Da Vinci to me."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"That could be meaningful to people."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"And most importantly, man, it's non-fungible."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Lot of tokens are fungible."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"These are not."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"- Yeah, there's no funging it."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"- This is not your granddad's token, man."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"It's not fungible."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"- You can't abscond with it, man."
01:08:13;01:08:16;"It's not fungible. - You can't abscond"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"with the token."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"If they had NFTs back in the early seventies, man,"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Mickey Hart wouldn't have had to leave the band"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"for a couple of years."

01:09:39;01:09:43;"the technology behind Ethereum and other cryptos"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"could be incredibly useful and even form"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"a whole new type of internet, change the world."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"People have made convincing cases for that."
01:09:50;01:09:53;"NFTs, that's up to the marketplace to decide"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"if that's gonna have value into the future."
01:09:55;01:10:00;"It is interesting that it went so quickly from,"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"it became a meme so quickly."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"It's not like something that for like,"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"you know, for five years, it was actually just like"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"really interesting artists were making these NFTs"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"or whatever."
01:10:09;01:10:13;"This is starting in like, you know, NBA Taco Bell universe."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- Yeah."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"- Kings of Leon are the first band to do it."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"I kind of remember hearing about it a couple of weeks ago"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"and thinking to myself, I wonder if any like musicians"
01:10:20;01:10:21;"will do it."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"And it's like clockwork."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"It's like, boom, Kings of Leon."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"All right, I wouldn't have guessed it was them,"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"but you know, they did it."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"- It's a speculative store of value, basically."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"It's like--"
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- Which is kind of what some people say all currencies are."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"You see a lot of times when people debate like Bitcoin,"
01:10:35;01:10:38;"somebody and somebody be like, it's not gold."
01:10:38;01:10:41;"And somebody be like, gold has no inherent value either."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"People can get in that."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"- Yeah."
01:10:43;01:10:45;"- But it is funny because things that tend to be very"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"valuable in the art world, those prices are determined"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"by a very small group of people."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"So could, I don't know."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"So what are these Taco Bell NFTs anyway?"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"They're images?"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"- They sold them for a dollar, which respect."
01:11:00;01:11:03;"- Dollar menu, non fungible tokens."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"- You know, it actually, there's a nice resonance"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"with NFTs and Subway."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"'Cause it reminds me, it's like, it doesn't,"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"it's not about the image or the aesthetic or the art."
01:11:11;01:11:15;"It's sort of just like putting your money into this place."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"And that's gonna do the job."
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Whereas like in Subway, it's the same thing."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"I'm just like, it's the food is not the point."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"- Right."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"- The art is not the point."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"It's sort of just like a bubble right now."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Put your money in."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"- Well, yeah, then you gotta wonder."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"- Eat lunch."
01:11:28;01:11:29;"- Right."
01:11:29;01:11:32;"Are people reselling NFTs for big money?"
01:11:32;01:11:32;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I think the Taco Bell ones, they sold for a dollar"
01:11:34;01:11:37;"and then people started selling them for whatever."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Hundreds of dollars, thousands."
01:11:39;01:11:40;"- Interesting."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"Maybe in a year we'll be looking back and being like,"
01:11:42;01:11:45;"damn, should have bought some of those Taco Bell NFTs."
01:11:45;01:11:49;"- No, to me, the interesting part is a corporation"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"issuing art, capital A art,"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"which is much different than when we were talking about"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"like the Taco Bell wing of LACMA."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"- Right, they're not sponsoring art."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"- Which is like--"
01:11:58;01:11:59;"- They're not collecting art."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"- Yeah, they're not buying."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"Taco Bell made art."
01:12:02;01:12:02;"- Right."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"- That's new and weird and dumb."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"- It's a new, weird, dumb time to be alive."
01:12:07;01:12:09;"(laughing)"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Taco Bell."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- Yeah, I gotta bring an image of this up."
01:12:13;01:12:17;"- Yeah, I mean, they're just kind of like ugly gifts."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Some pieces have already resold for over $3,000."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"So that's decent."
01:12:21;01:12:22;"I mean--"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"- How many did they put out, I wonder?"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"- Not a lot."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"I mean, people are spending money."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"- Okay, so, and by the way, Jake."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"- Oh, five copies."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"- This is important to note,"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"that Taco Bell says all profits will go"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"towards its Live Moss Scholarship."
01:12:36;01:12:40;"So we should probably check what that is."
01:12:40;01:12:44;"Live Moss Scholarship, it's not based on your grades"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"or how well you play sports."
01:12:46;01:12:47;"It's about students--"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"- Grimes."
01:12:48;01:12:50;"- Passionate about creating a better future."
01:12:50;01:12:54;"- Grimes sold her digital collection for $5.8 million,"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"which means she's getting out at the right time."
01:12:57;01:12:58;"- Damn, that's serious money."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- She sold off her whole collection."
01:13:00;01:13:01;"Yeah, it really is."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"- Wow."
01:13:02;01:13:06;"- Has no one asked you to make an NFT, Ezra?"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"- I've had some conversations with people,"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"like, you heard about this (beep)"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"and I was kind of like, yeah."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"(laughing)"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"No, I think we probably missed the NFT boat."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"I guess you could consider it."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Cryptocurrency is interesting."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"I don't know if this is up my alley, but we'll see."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"I gotta do some more research."
01:13:23;01:13:28;"I have a friend who, trying to explain to me NFTs"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"a couple months ago, told me that he has bought"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"all of the Garbage Pail Kids in NFTs"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"because that's where they exist now."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"That helped me understand, you know,"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"where it was trading cards for us."
01:13:43;01:13:43;"- Right, right."
01:13:43;01:13:48;"- We now buy NFT Garbage Pail Kids."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"And he--"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"- It reminds me a lot of cards."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"And that helped me understand it."
01:13:53;01:13:56;"And it's also pretty silly, is that he bought,"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"I think, like a couple hundred dollars worth"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"of Garbage Pail NFTs, and they're probably"
01:14:00;01:14:03;"worth about $7,000 now."
01:14:03;01:14:04;"- Okay."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"- He should sell now."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- I wonder."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"- I bet they'll be worthless in six months."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"But I don't know anything."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"I'm an idiot."
01:14:14;01:14:19;"I'm painting again! (x3)"
01:14:19;01:14:24;"I'm cleaning again! (x3)"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"I'm cleaning my brain!"
01:14:26;01:14:52;"(Instrumental)"
01:14:52;01:15:04;"Pretty soon now, I will be better! (x3)"
01:15:04;01:15:08;"And see, and see, until it's finished!"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"Alright, ready to get in the top 5?"
01:15:10;01:15:16;"It's time for the Top 5! 5 on iTunes!"
01:15:16;01:15:23;"Alright, so this week on the Top 5, we're doing the Top 5 hits this week in 1965."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Why 1965?"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"That was the glorious year that Subway was founded."
01:15:28;01:15:33;"By Fred DeLuca and future R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"Peter Buck!"
01:15:35;01:15:40;"So Jake, last, two weeks ago when we were doing the Top 5 with Baeo, because it was 1963,"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"everything had that ""In My Neighborhood"" feel."
01:15:43;01:15:50;"So all we did was basically picture the Dunkin' Donuts movie with that music."
01:15:50;01:15:55;"So I don't think we can help but do it with the, it's gonna probably feel kinda the same."
01:15:55;01:16:01;"1963 is also peak ""In My Neighborhood"" year music, maybe '65 will be a little bit different."
01:16:01;01:16:09;"It's also so funny to imagine the Subway movie, just like imagine that you were assigned to write the screenplay"
01:16:09;01:16:17;"and you're like interviewing Fred DeLuca and you're just like, ""Alright, the lightbulb moment in a movie like this is huge."
01:16:17;01:16:23;"It's gotta be some game-changing thing. So tell me, how did the idea come together?"""
01:16:23;01:16:30;"And he's just like, ""I was at a barbecue with Peter Buck and I said, 'I gotta go to college. You got any ideas?'"""
01:16:30;01:16:32;"And you're like, ""Okay, I like where this is heading."""
01:16:32;01:16:36;"And he said, ""Yes, you should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich restaurants."""
01:16:36;01:16:40;"You're just like, ""Wait, wait, wait. I think I missed a few steps."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"Did you guys put your heads together trying to figure some stuff out?"""
01:16:43;01:16:47;"And he's like, ""No, no. I said, 'How should I pay for college?' and that's what he said."""
01:16:47;01:16:53;"Okay, alright. We're gonna have to figure out how to dramatize that."
01:16:53;01:17:01;"Well, I love, I mean, I could picture like the cinematic grandeur though because he's coming from this working class background."
01:17:01;01:17:10;"They move from the Bronx to Bridgeport and then Peter Buck's living in this sprawling white house with two car garage, huge green lawn."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"I'm picturing like the beautiful crane shot over the house."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"I like that element of it."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"Expansive."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"The working class Italian dude."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"This lush Connecticut suburbia."
01:17:20;01:17:26;"And then the all-American 1965 senator's son kind of Peter Buck guy."
01:17:26;01:17:34;"Yeah, yeah. Also, maybe, again, you know much more about these people from the book, but I like the idea of like Fred DeLuca."
01:17:34;01:17:39;"Maybe he's played by Michael Imperioli. Kind of like passionate guy."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"A little old, but yeah."
01:17:41;01:17:44;"We'll de-age him like the Irishman."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"But also, I know nothing about..."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"We're gonna spend $60 million on de-aging."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"But let's have him be like a really emotive actor."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"And then the Peter Buck character from the wealthier family."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"I like the idea of him being like a Michael Shannon character."
01:17:59;01:18:01;"Just kind of like a weird, eerie dude."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"Like stoic as hell."
01:18:03;01:18:07;"Yeah, just kind of like a dead-eyed, kind of like creepy."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"No disrespect to the Buck family. This is pure conjecture."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"But just kind of like a creepy, like dead-eyed fella."
01:18:14;01:18:19;"And that, you know, Fred DeLuca's like, ""Pete, man, how am I gonna pay for college?"""
01:18:19;01:18:21;"He just like looks straight past him."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"And he's like, ""You should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich restaurants."""
01:18:25;01:18:27;"And then just like walks away."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"Yeah, just walks away."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"And then DeLuca's just standing there like, ""What?"""
01:18:32;01:18:36;"And he's just like, ""I'm leaving. See you later."""
01:18:36;01:18:39;"And he's like, ""I couldn't stop thinking about it. Why the number 32?"""
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And then he like kind of comes back to him."
01:18:41;01:18:45;"And he's like, ""Did I hallucinate this? Or did you just say to me that to pay for college,"
01:18:45;01:18:48;"I should open up 32 submarine sandwich restaurants?"""
01:18:48;01:18:51;"""Yes, that's what I said. It'll take about 10 years."
01:18:51;01:18:55;"After that, once we make it to 33, the growth will be explosive."
01:18:55;01:18:58;"I imagine that by 1994, we could get to 8,000."""
01:18:58;01:19:01;"He's like, ""Pete, you're freaking me out, man."""
01:19:01;01:19:03;"He's like, ""We can do this."""
01:19:03;01:19:07;"And then he peels off 10 crisp $100 bills."
01:19:07;01:19:09;"I don't know anything about sandwiches."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Take this money."
01:19:10;01:19:11;"This is your startup money."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"Take this money. Go to the-- find us a location."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"Go to the grocery store."
01:19:15;01:19:20;"Buy some cold cuts, some bread, some tomatoes, and some lettuce."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"It's very simple."
01:19:21;01:19:23;"If you build it, they will come."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Maybe there is a sci-fi element."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"Maybe Peter Buck was sent from the future."
01:19:26;01:19:29;"He actually knew what was to come to pass."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"And he took Fred DeLuca on this journey."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Maybe it's the Peter Buck from REM."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"He goes back in time."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Peter Buck made so much money when REM was at their peak."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"He built a time machine."
01:19:40;01:19:42;"Went back to 1965."
01:19:42;01:19:45;"And this is the reality that we're living in, actually."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"When REM first came up in the '80s and the '90s,"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Subway didn't exist."
01:19:50;01:19:53;"And then in 1991, Peter Buck built a time machine,"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"went back to 1965, and started a tangent of reality"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"in which Subway sandwich shops went global."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"And that's the reality that we're in right now."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"Because there's an alternate reality where Mike Davis"
01:20:05;01:20:09;"and his Upstate sandwich shops were the Subway and took over."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Yes."
01:20:10;01:20:11;"That's great."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"It starts with an earthquake."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"Birds and snakes and airplanes."
01:20:15;01:20:19;"And Lenny Bruce is not afraid."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"I am a hurricane."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Listen to yourself, churn."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"World serves its own needs."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Dummies serve your own needs."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Feed it off an ox feet grunt."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"No strength."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"The ladder starts to clatter with fear."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"Fight down high."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Fire and a fire represent a seven games"
01:20:30;01:20:33;"and a government for hire and a combat site."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"Left and west are coming in a hurry"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"with the furies breathing down your neck."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Team by team, reformers battle Trump."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Tether crop, look at that."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"No pain."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"Fine."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Then, uh-oh."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Overflow of population, comic book, but it'll do."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Save yourself."
01:20:46;01:20:47;"Sub yourself."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"World serves its own needs."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"Listen to your heart."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"Free dummy with the red shirt and the ribbon and the right."
01:20:51;01:20:52;"Right."
01:20:52;01:20:53;"You patriotic, patriotic, slam fight."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"Right."
01:20:54;01:20:55;"I feel it."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"Pretty psyched."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"It's the end of the world as we know it."
01:21:04;01:21:09;"It's the end of the world as we know it."
01:21:09;01:21:12;"I feel fine."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"I mean, that is like a classic premise"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"and one I always think about is like,"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"knowing everything you know now,"
01:21:18;01:21:22;"if you went back in time, what would you do?"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"There's been a million takes on this,"
01:21:24;01:21:28;"but it is funny to think like, you know, obviously,"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"let's say you had a little money,"
01:21:30;01:21:33;"you could probably make some good stock picks,"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"but frankly, a lot of people, if you went back in time,"
01:21:35;01:21:39;"you wouldn't have, it wouldn't be like that easy."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"So it would about be how much like,"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"I wonder how much like gumption it would take."
01:21:43;01:21:47;"Like for instance, knowing what we know now about Subway,"
01:21:47;01:21:51;"let's say Jake, let's say you and I were sent back to 1965."
01:21:51;01:21:52;"Could we even do it?"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"We might not have the business acumen of a Fred DeLuca."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"I guess you and I, if we, if we just found ourselves,"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"like we woke up and it's 1965,"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"we could just rip over to Bridgeport"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"and at the very least just kind of like try to cut ourselves in with those dudes."
01:22:04;01:22:09;"Yeah. Like, Hey, listen, I'll invest a thousand dollars in"
01:22:09;01:22:12;"and buy 5% of the company."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Right. We probably couldn't compete with them,"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"but we could probably maybe just go."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"I mean, also what a grim, what a grim vision of time travel."
01:22:19;01:22:24;"Let's go back in time and then spend 30 years toiling,"
01:22:24;01:22:27;"creating a Subway sandwich shop."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Let's not have fun."
01:22:28;01:22:32;"Let's not go to concerts or like invest in stocks or bet on sports."
01:22:32;01:22:37;"Let's go back and start a chain restaurant and really work hard at it."
01:22:37;01:22:40;"Here's my hard sci-fi pitch."
01:22:40;01:22:44;"My hard sci-fi pitch is it's Jersey Mike."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"He's old."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"He's dedicated his life to these Subway sandwiches."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"He's unhappy."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"His life didn't turn out how he wanted."
01:22:53;01:22:56;"He goes back in time."
01:22:56;01:22:59;"He pretends to be Buck."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"He gives our guy the idea."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Fred DeLuca."
01:23:02;01:23:06;"He gives Fred DeLuca the idea to open the sandwiches to take him out of business."
01:23:06;01:23:11;"So he, you know, loses the Subway war, you know,"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"loses the sandwich war and then spends time with his family."
01:23:15;01:23:19;"So really our hero is Mike Davis, you know, and how does."
01:23:19;01:23:22;"Right. By the way, Mike Davis is not Jersey Mike."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"He's upstate Mike."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"Oh, he's upstate."
01:23:25;01:23:30;"Mike Davis has been lost to history."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"He's a pure figure."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"Although it's funny."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"There's also the Southern California based writer Mike Davis."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"Yes."
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Maybe that's the same guy."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"All these Mike Davis's are the same guy."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"You got run out of town in upstate New York,"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"moved to LA and started writing about urbanism."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"As you do."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"As one does."
01:23:52;01:23:55;"Only one of them is non fungible."
01:23:55;01:23:58;"The non fungible Mike Davis."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"Mike Davis."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Yeah."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"Someone gets sent back in time today and they're just like,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"they really got NFTs on their mind."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"They get sent back to 1965 and all they can think about is, all right,"
01:24:07;01:24:11;"I'm going to be early on NFTs."
01:24:11;01:24:16;"But they like, but they know nothing about like 50 years of history that led up to it."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"Just know nothing about like actual like computers."
01:24:19;01:24:23;"Just rolling up to an IBM supercomputer where there's like 30 employees putting"
01:24:23;01:24:27;"giant punch cards in and just being like, all right, guys,"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"I'm about to blow your mind."
01:24:28;01:24:32;"Non fungible tokens."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"This is a million dollar idea."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"Grimes just made 6 million bucks selling them."
01:24:37;01:24:40;"With your guys' computer know-how and my vision of the future,"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"we can make some serious cash."
01:24:43;01:24:48;"Oh my God."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Just got to wait like 60 years."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"You know what?"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"We've definitely done."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"I guess I'll open a Subway sandwich."
01:24:54;01:24:57;"We've definitely done a time travel bit on time crisis."
01:24:57;01:25:01;"I feel like it was, I think it was like we got sent back to San Francisco."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Yeah."
01:25:02;01:25:06;"And we had to be really careful when we went to see like the Grateful Dead at"
01:25:06;01:25:11;"like Winterland or some shit because we wanted to catch the show but not to"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"have a butterfly effect."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"I think we also wanted to like."
01:25:14;01:25:17;"Travis Scott, back to the future."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Wasn't there a whole."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"There's also Travis Scott back to the future."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"But I think we also wanted to like somehow spy and Charles Manson."
01:25:24;01:25:26;"Oh, maybe it was like chaos related."
01:25:26;01:25:30;"Yeah, it was like we wanted to go back and like just follow him around the"
01:25:30;01:25:35;"hate and like see if he was talking to like weird CIA like right operatives."
01:25:35;01:25:39;"But then while we're back there, we can also catch the dead at the Fillmore."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"Right?"
01:25:40;01:25:43;"I mean, if we're there, how could we not?"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"We get sent back to the mid 60s."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"We're just doing all sorts of stuff."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"We're investing early with Fred DeLuca and Subway."
01:25:51;01:25:58;"We're catching the first Warlocks gig at the pizzeria in Palo Alto or"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"whatever."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"Oh, in Menlo Park."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"We'd have to like make an itinerary before we went back."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"We have to write down all the dates."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"Right."
01:26:05;01:26:09;"You know, so we'd be like back in the East Coast dealing with Fred DeLuca."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Then we'd be like, dude, Warlocks gig is in Palo Alto in two days."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"We got to get on a Pan Am flight in Toronto."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"Get out there."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"Forget about the butterfly effect for a second."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"But like we end up in the mid 60s and we're just like putting our heads"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"together just to remember every like historically significant thing."
01:26:24;01:26:29;"And like then one day, like we look back 10 years later and just like we're"
01:26:29;01:26:32;"super rich and just be like, yeah, these these two weird dudes."
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Nobody knew where they came from."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"Named Jake and Ezra."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"These guys have a significant stake in Subway."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"They own about 80 McDonald's in the Midwest."
01:26:42;01:26:45;"They managed the Grateful Dead."
01:26:45;01:26:48;"They invented non fungible tokens."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"Yeah."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"And they invented non fungible tokens."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"I mean, you know, just a really."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"They started Apple computers."
01:26:55;01:26:58;"Just a real interesting portfolio for these dudes."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"They wrote some great songs, too."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"I mean, wrote a lot of great songs."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"We could steal all the songs from the future."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Oh, classic like written."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Yeah, like the Beatles movie."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Yeah."
01:27:08;01:27:13;"They financed Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver."
01:27:13;01:27:16;"I wish there was more time travel movies like like that were fun, like"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"Back to the Future, not like super serious like."
01:27:19;01:27:20;"Right."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"I think for whatever the I think part of it is like fun."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"Back to the Future is just so good that it's like, yeah, it really sets"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"the bar high."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Bill and Ted's Bill and Ted's fun."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"Bill and Ted's is cool."
01:27:30;01:27:34;"The part of Back to the Future when he's playing the Van Halen licks at"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"the 1955 dance."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"I mean, that's just one of the most amazing scenes."
01:27:39;01:27:42;"And then like Chuck Berry's cousin is calling."
01:27:42;01:27:46;"It's just like that's truly like the epitome of time travel movie right"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"there."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"That's it."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Yeah."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"No, it's about as good as it gets."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"All right."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Let's get in this top five."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Number five, 1965."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"Herman's Hermits."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"Can't you hear my heartbeat?"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Nice hand claps."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"What's DeLuca doing during this?"
01:28:39;01:28:47;"He's driving around in his 1959 Chevy going to various suppliers around"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Bridgeport."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"He's got to go to the butcher, get the meat lined up, get the cheese"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"lined up."
01:28:53;01:28:56;"He's got to go to the produce salesman."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Ooh, yeah."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"And then like after this, it's like 10 years earlier."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"And then we'll see him sort of more destitute, you know, or not destitute,"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"but needing."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Yeah, this is definitely not in my neighborhood."
01:29:09;01:29:15;"This is much more like a industrious guy running errands on a Saturday."
01:29:15;01:29:19;"Yeah, this is not like mischievous, like in my neighborhood."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"Herman's Hermits have some gems."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"I mean, yeah, it's funny."
01:29:51;01:29:55;"Like that 1963 music still was very in my neighborhood."
01:29:55;01:29:59;"You listen to this '65, I mean, it's great."
01:29:59;01:30:02;"I guess it also makes you realize why like the Beatles were just like"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"blowing people's minds."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"It's got a little more swagger."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Herman's Hermits are great."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"It doesn't get more square than the Herman's Hermits."
01:30:11;01:30:15;"It has a little more like groove and rock than the Beatles."
01:30:15;01:30:19;"It has a little more like groove and rock than some of that '63."
01:30:19;01:30:23;"But you can tell, you can see why like '66, '67 were just insanely"
01:30:23;01:30:27;"transformative years for rock and roll and pop music."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Number four."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Oh, this is a classic."
01:30:31;01:30:35;"Roger Miller, King of the Road, country music."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"You know this one, right?"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"Of course."
01:30:40;01:30:42;"Yeah, picture going from that Herman's Hermits to like"
01:30:42;01:30:49;"Jimi Hendrix two years later."
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Great vocal tone."
01:30:51;01:30:53;"Yeah, great singer."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Banger man."
01:31:24;01:31:48;"Cool shout out."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"So he's like a guy like hopping trains?"
01:31:51;01:31:55;"Yeah, I actually, now I'm confused about what this song is really about."
01:31:55;01:32:03;"I've never listened to the lyrics before."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"It's funny because in the chorus he says,"
01:32:05;01:32:09;"""I'm a man of means, by no means, king of the road."""
01:32:09;01:32:11;"So is he saying, ""I'm not the king of the road?"""
01:32:11;01:32:14;"No, I think he's saying, ""I'm a man of means by no means."""
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Hmm."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"Like, he's not a man of means."
01:32:19;01:32:23;"Right."
01:32:23;01:32:26;"Pushing broom."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"So he's just living on the road, making money here and there?"
01:32:29;01:32:34;"Yeah."
01:32:34;01:32:37;"I think the first time I heard this song was in Swingers."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"It's in Swingers?"
01:32:39;01:32:43;"Yeah, it's a pretty big moment in Swingers."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Maybe on the way to Vegas?"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Really?"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"I can't remember exactly where it was, but."
01:32:47;01:32:54;"It's a good song."
01:32:54;01:32:59;"It's funny, it's like, that song is objectively cooler than Herman's Hermits."
01:32:59;01:33:04;"It's like, maybe because this new type of rock was still finding its footing,"
01:33:04;01:33:08;"whereas country was in this mature, cool place."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Upright bass, the swagger."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"Yeah, I guess it's about a guy riding the rails."
01:33:13;01:33:20;"Also, a perfect song for a montage of Fred DeLuca pounding the pavement."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"King of the road, man."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"Not in my neighborhood, though."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"He's king of the road."
01:33:25;01:33:31;"He's driving around Southern Connecticut, comparing prices from all these different suppliers."
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Mm-hmm."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"He's getting quotes."
01:33:33;01:33:39;"He's looking to buy a bunch of used kitchen equipment, a meat slicer, a few fridges."
01:33:39;01:33:44;"He's got the want ads sitting on the front seat of the car."
01:33:44;01:33:45;"He's working."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"The supplier montage."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"It'd be a great time for some cameos."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"OK, I've never heard of this one at number three."
01:33:52;01:33:55;"Jewel Aikens, The Birds and the Bees."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"Strange sounds."
01:34:10;01:34:18;"So I think this is when he pulls up to the house to ask about the college loan."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"Yes, yes."
01:34:19;01:34:24;"Right, so it's a montage of the fancy Connecticut barbecue."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"Right."
01:34:25;01:34:33;"And he pulls in, and he's just gotten the semester fees, and he's like, ""I can't afford to go to college."""
01:34:33;01:34:34;"Yeah, yeah."
01:34:34;01:34:41;"Peter Buck's wife is pulling out this beautifully sumptuous stack of corn on the cob."
01:34:41;01:34:45;"There's the red and white checkered tablecloth on the picnic table."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Right."
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Just the most lush vision of suburbia ever."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Beautiful mid-'60s suburbia."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"You don't know this song?"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"I don't actually know this song, no."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"All right, so 1965 is still pretty square, too."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Big time."
01:35:26;01:35:28;"I would have guessed this is more like early '60s."
01:35:28;01:35:31;"If you told me this was like '61, '62, I'd be like, ""Sure."""
01:35:48;01:35:59;"There's something about when you describe Michael Shannon, and there's something I was thinking about how, like Bill Murray in Royal Tenenbaums, you're just throwing golf balls in the pool."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Oh, in Rushmore."
01:36:01;01:36:09;"In Rushmore, I mean, yeah, when he's just throwing golf balls in the pool and he's just talking to Buck and Buck is just throwing golf balls in the pool."
01:36:09;01:36:13;"Right, he's kind of like off, not-- like, totally avoiding the rest of the party."
01:36:13;01:36:20;"Fred DeLuca just kind of, like, spies him and he's like, ""Buck's always been kind of weird, but he's pretty smart."""
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Just like, doesn't even make eye contact."
01:36:23;01:36:30;"""Hey Pete, any ideas how I could pay for college?"" Doesn't even look up, still throwing the golf balls in."
01:36:30;01:36:35;"""You should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich restaurants."""
01:36:35;01:36:40;"I like how your Peter Buck imitation sounds like your Jim Morrison impression."
01:36:40;01:36:44;"Oh, I mean, it is-- Jim Morrison's kind of a mystical guy."
01:36:44;01:36:49;"Yeah, maybe the birds and the bees fades out and we just kind of open with a little bit of, like, the end."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"[MIMICS GOLF BALLS]"
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Mystical dawning."
01:36:54;01:36:59;"The breakdown on Peace Frog. The spoken word breakdown on Peace Frog."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"Yeah, yeah."
01:37:11;01:37:20;"""On Don's sacred highway, you should open a chain of 32 submarine sandwich restaurants. Blood everywhere. Visions of-- dark visions of the future."""
01:37:20;01:37:25;"Also, you know, like, we've definitely talked on the show before about the-- I don't even know if you'd call it a meme,"
01:37:25;01:37:32;"but it's like something people say a lot when they're comparing the generations and people are kind of getting into generational warfare"
01:37:32;01:37:37;"and saying, ""Oh, boomers, conservative boomers, you guys don't know how easy you had it."

01:51:07;01:51:10;"and they'll just be like-- for the white album,"
01:51:10;01:51:13;"be like, you know, like a baseball game, take it down,"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"and it's just like, ""Four."""
01:51:16;01:51:20;"Picture this, everybody. 1968."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"There are four Subways,"
01:51:22;01:51:25;"violence at the Democratic National Convention,"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"and the Beatles drop the white album."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"♪ Flew in from Miami Beach, B-O-A-C ♪"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"♪ Didn't get to bed last night ♪"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"♪ On the way to paperback was on my knee ♪"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"♪ Man, I had a dreadful flight ♪"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"♪ I'm back in the U.S.S.R. ♪"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"♪ You don't know how lucky you are, boy ♪"
01:51:45;01:51:48;"♪ Back in the U.S.S.R. ♪"
01:51:48;01:51:51;"We listen to, like, an early '90s McCartney solo album,"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"also eating Subway,"
01:51:54;01:51:57;"but now there's 8,000, 4,000?"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"37,000."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"What year did they open their 33rd location?"
01:52:02;01:52:05;"- 33rd? - That's when everything..."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"- Oh, like '76. - Yeah."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"That's when sh-- went crazy."
01:52:09;01:52:12;"All right, well, I think maybe we're getting a little bit back"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"more into this show rules territory."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I think..."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"the Duncan Subway McDonald's is a low point."
01:52:20;01:52:23;"Being on the precipice of just naming our top five Beatles songs"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"was perhaps a low point, but..."
01:52:26;01:52:29;"- This show's ending very strong. - But the Beatles Subway party,"
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I think that's something that we should legitimately do."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"We should each invite our friends and family,"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"especially as more people get vaccinated,"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"maybe this summer, Jake and I host it."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"But also, that's something that TC heads can do as well."
01:52:42;01:52:46;"- And it's called the Subway Series. - It's called the Subway Series."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"- This is our Subway Series. - That's right."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"- This is our Mets Yankees. - And the Beatles famously played at Shea Stadium."
01:52:52;01:52:56;"Yeah, this one's strong. I feel like there's a lot of synergy happening right here."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"But anyway, we're gonna start with help"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"and just get a bunch of subs from Subway."
01:53:02;01:53:05;"All right. In two weeks, I just want to say this on the show"
01:53:05;01:53:10;"to hold ourselves to it. I think we should finally talk about the Super Bowl."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"- Cool. - I think I'm finally ready to talk about them."
01:53:13;01:53:16;"Jake, who won the Super Bowl this year? Do you know?"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"(sighs)"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"Whoever Tom Brady was playing for. Florida something?"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"- Okay, correct. - Florida Panthers?"
01:53:24;01:53:28;"- And the Florida... - Florida Gators."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"And the Florida Gators took it."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"The easy way to remember what team Tom Brady plays for now"
01:53:34;01:53:37;"is the phrase ""Tompa Bay."""
01:53:37;01:53:40;"'Cause his name is Tom, and he lives in Tampa Bay."
01:53:40;01:53:43;"So just remember, ""Tompa Bay."""
01:53:43;01:53:46;"- Wait, did you make that up, or is that a thing? - No, that's a thing."
01:53:46;01:53:49;"- Right? - That is so weak."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"- That's not a thing! - ""Tompa Bay""?"
01:53:52;01:53:55;"Yeah, 'cause Tom Brady moved to Tampa Bay. ""Tampa Bay."""
01:53:55;01:53:58;"Is that a thing, Seinfeld?"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"- Yeah, it's a thing. - People call it ""Tampa Bay""?"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"Yeah, I assume."
01:54:04;01:54:09;"I don't know. Do people call Tampa Bay ""Tampa Bay""?"
01:54:09;01:54:14;"Or is it more like a conceptual, like a psychological geography?"
01:54:14;01:54:17;"It's like calling the Kennedy administration ""Camelot."""
01:54:17;01:54:20;"- You called it... - No, you know, I hadn't."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"- Is ""Tampa Bay""-- - Yeah, I hadn't actually--"
01:54:23;01:54:26;"I'd never heard of it before, but Tom Brady is actually seeking"
01:54:26;01:54:29;"to trademark Tampa Bay and Tampa Brady"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"- per ESPN. - ( laughs )"
01:54:32;01:54:35;"- ""Tampa Brady""? - Tom Brady--"
01:54:35;01:54:38;"Tom Brady's agents have--"
01:54:38;01:54:41;"yeah, are seeking to trademark Tampa Bay."
01:54:41;01:54:44;"There's merch. Yeah, this is a thing. It's a phenomenon."
01:54:44;01:54:47;"- This is the new way. - Okay, we gotta trademark"
01:54:47;01:54:51;"- the Beatles' subway parties. - Maybe that's the TC NFTs"
01:54:51;01:54:54;"- we're gonna drop. - We get sued by the Beatles and Subway."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"A cool collage of the Beatles"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"- with, like, subs in front of them. - Right."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"We make $40 million in two days,"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"and then the lawsuits start."
01:55:06;01:55:09;"Paul McCartney is not feeling it."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"No peace and love from Ringo. Just, ""How dare you?"""
01:55:12;01:55:15;"Fred DeLuca Jr., just irate,"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"coming after us."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"All right, so in two weeks, though, we're gonna go deep into"
01:55:21;01:55:24;"not only the Super Bowl ads, but I also wanna do some play-by-play"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"analysis of exactly what happened between"
01:55:27;01:55:30;"Tampa Bay and Kansas City."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"Correct? All right."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"So, Kansas City, KC Masterpiece."
01:55:36;01:55:39;"Just freestyling here."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"KC Masterpiece versus Tampa Bay. We're gonna get into granular detail"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"what went down on that fateful day."
01:55:45;01:55:48;"And we will talk about the ads as well."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"That would be funny if we spent so much time analyzing the game that we still"
01:55:51;01:55:54;"had to push the ads to the next show."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"But also, definitely let's talk about Bob Marley in Delaware, because"
01:55:57;01:56:00;"we had a good thread about that, and there is"
01:56:00;01:56:03;"that sh*t goes deeper than we thought. Bob Marley's"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"year in Delaware made an impact on him, his music, and of course"
01:56:06;01:56:09;"on the people of the Wilmington area."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"We should try to find out if Joe Biden ever commented on it."
01:56:12;01:56:15;"Anyway, all that and more in two weeks. Great to have you back, Jake."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"See everybody soon."
01:56:18;01:56:21;"Great to be back."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"Knigg."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"(electronic music)"
