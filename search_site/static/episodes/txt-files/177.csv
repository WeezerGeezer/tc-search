00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:14;"On today's TC, we'll talk about Larry Norman, Jesus Christ, and Hubba Stank, among many others."
00:14;00:19;"This is a very special TC."
00:19;00:25;"So grab a beverage, kick up your feet, and relax."
00:26;00:30;"Time Crisis, with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The war I fell to obey me, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Even only they"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:21;"We've been banking the Eps."
01:21;01:23;"Just a little bit, not severely banked."
01:23;01:25;"Light banking."
01:25;01:27;"Light banking, just a little bit ahead of schedule."
01:27;01:29;"Just trying to get on more of a summer schedule."
01:29;01:31;"How you doing, Jake?"
01:31;01:33;"Doing great."
01:33;01:35;"We're all here together in person in the studio."
01:35;01:36;"Got Seinfeld."
01:36;01:37;"Hey, what's up?"
01:37;01:38;"Got Nick."
01:38;01:39;"Hello."
01:39;01:40;"Good to be back."
01:40;01:42;"Gotta say, in person feels great."
01:42;01:43;"Totally different energy."
01:43;01:44;"Been missing it."
01:44;01:45;"Yep."
01:45;01:47;"It flows different."
01:47;01:49;"Yeah, we got them in the future, we gotta mix it up."
01:49;01:50;"We gotta get a little bit of both."
01:50;01:51;"Yep."
01:51;01:53;"But with our busy schedules, it's not always easy."
01:53;01:55;"Getting cross town to Culver at rush hour."
01:55;01:56;"[laughs]"
01:56;01:57;"Hardcore."
01:57;01:58;"Gotta structure your day around that."
01:58;01:59;"[laughs]"
01:59;02:01;"Hardcore."
02:01;02:03;"We gotta maybe just build a TC clubhouse."
02:03;02:05;"TC East. Eastside."
02:05;02:10;"Maybe we can link up with Yardhouse and see if they can give us a designated booth."
02:10;02:12;"Kind of a win-win."
02:12;02:13;"[laughs]"
02:13;02:15;"Soundproofed booth."
02:15;02:17;"[laughs]"
02:17;02:19;"It's just really loud."
02:19;02:21;"I mean, we've recorded Time Crisis in restaurants before."
02:21;02:22;"That's true."
02:22;02:26;"We did the Tom's Diner, also known as the Seinfeld Diner."
02:26;02:30;"We did a diner in Iowa City. Or not Iowa City, maybe Ames, Iowa."
02:30;02:31;"Oh yeah."
02:31;02:32;"That's crazy."
02:32;02:36;"Yeah, we used to just be doing on the ground reporting."
02:36;02:42;"In some ways, that's the least TC [beep] we ever did, was being on the ground at the presidential primaries."
02:42;02:44;"What were we doing?"
02:44;02:45;"[laughs]"
02:45;02:46;"I can't remember."
02:46;02:47;"That was too ambitious."
02:47;02:48;"That was too ambitious for us."
02:48;02:51;"Yeah, we really hit our stride when we stopped trying so hard."
02:51;02:56;"Seinfeld, you said we got an interesting email recently about baked potatoes."
02:56;03:01;"I'm sorry to say we kind of dropped the hot potato in the last ep."
03:01;03:04;"I think there were very few baked potato references."
03:04;03:07;"But this is the Time Crisis year of the baked potato."
03:07;03:09;"So let's keep it going."
03:09;03:12;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
03:12;03:14;"Yeah, this is incredible."
03:14;03:17;"This is an email from Brittany S. in St. Petersburg, Florida."
03:17;03:20;"She writes, ""Long time listener. First time emailer."
03:20;03:23;"I love the show TC Head for Life. Nice."
03:23;03:28;"Had to write in to tell y'all about the '90s themed baked potato restaurant in my town."
03:28;03:31;"It's a restaurant called Half Baked."""
03:31;03:32;"[laughs]"
03:32;03:34;"It's the Half Baked Potato. Hang on."
03:34;03:35;"Oh."
03:35;03:39;"It's the Half Baked Potato in St. Petersburg."
03:39;03:41;"The menu is very interesting. They have a lot of--"
03:41;03:46;"I just got to say, interesting play on words, because when it's just called Half Baked,"
03:46;03:51;"it makes you think of the famous stoner comedy with Dave Chappelle and Jim Brewer."
03:51;03:54;"But when you hear the whole phrase, ""the half baked potato,"""
03:54;03:58;"suddenly I stop thinking-- I don't think about the movie Half Baked."
03:58;04:04;"I'm just picturing kind of like a hard, not fully cooked potato."
04:04;04:07;"It does sound like an undercooked baked potato a little bit."
04:07;04:12;"They are apparently 420 friendly on their site."
04:12;04:14;"Okay. What does that mean for a restaurant in Florida?"
04:14;04:15;"They don't freak you out if you're high?"
04:15;04:16;"420 vibes."
04:16;04:21;"It's like a stoner-- it's a psychedelic take on the baked potato."
04:21;04:24;"Okay. All right. That's that. I guess they can't help-- you can't--"
04:24;04:26;"weed's not legal in Florida, is it?"
04:26;04:27;"No."
04:27;04:28;"It will be soon, I'm sure."
04:28;04:30;"All right. They can't help it. They're in Florida."
04:30;04:32;"They're only so 420 friendly."
04:32;04:35;"Yeah. There can't be no laws here."
04:35;04:41;"The Half Baked Potato has successfully lobbied Governor Ron DeSantis to grant them--"
04:41;04:43;"[laughs]"
04:43;04:50;"a type of sovereignty akin to a Native American reservation"
04:50;04:53;"or maybe the Vatican City in Italy,"
04:53;04:57;"which allows them to be truly 420 friendly."
04:57;05:00;"But as soon as you step outside of the Half Baked Potato's doors,"
05:00;05:05;"you will be immediately arrested by the authorities."
05:05;05:07;"They do have their own police force."
05:07;05:09;"It's like Vatican City."
05:09;05:13;"Their bio is delicious loaded potatoes with a mix of '80s and '90s throwback,"
05:13;05:16;"New Orleans flavor, and 420 vibes."
05:16;05:18;"Wait, I don't get the '80s and '90s."
05:18;05:20;"The baked potato is timeless."
05:20;05:23;"Well, we did talk about how this all started with us saying"
05:23;05:26;"that the baked potato feels a little bit like a relic."
05:26;05:28;"It was in the 20th century."
05:28;05:32;"Okay. So what are the '90s toppings that you could get on a baked potato?"
05:32;05:33;"Okay. So--"
05:33;05:37;"Only '90s kids will remember these baked potato toppings."
05:37;05:39;"Oh, wow. I mean, let me tell you."
05:39;05:42;"So they've got about on their menu--"
05:42;05:46;"I mean, I want to say 27 or so different signature potatoes."
05:46;05:47;"That's too many."
05:47;05:49;"You know there's that show Bar Rescue"
05:49;05:53;"where the guy goes to bars and helps them kind of tighten things up?"
05:53;05:55;"We should do a baked potato rescue show."
05:55;05:59;"We go to baked potato restaurants, kind of open the books,"
05:59;06:04;"look at the menu, and maybe kind of help them get things a little more ship shape."
06:04;06:09;"I mean, these titles, these names of these dishes are very clever."
06:09;06:11;"They've got Be My Super Hero."
06:11;06:14;"There's a hero meat, Suzuki."
06:14;06:17;"There's It's Brisket B***, which is like--"
06:17;06:18;"[laughter]"
06:18;06:20;"Which is like It's Brittany B***."
06:20;06:21;"Okay."
06:21;06:24;"All right. This place rules. They actually don't need our help."
06:24;06:27;"Pasta La Vista Baby, that's their pasta baked potato."
06:27;06:29;"Pasta baked potato?"
06:29;06:31;"So there's pasta in the baked potato?"
06:31;06:36;"So it's topped with spaghetti bolognese, smoked sausage mozzarella,"
06:36;06:38;"and they've described it as comfort food is its finest."
06:38;06:42;"That one's for Jake. Jake loves a sausage topping on pizza."
06:42;06:43;"That's true."
06:43;06:46;"I mean, the truth is the spaghetti potato combo is interesting."
06:46;06:49;"But there's no actual spaghetti. It's just the bolognese sauce?"
06:49;06:54;"It says spaghetti bolognese, so I think there's spaghetti in it."
06:54;06:57;"It's called Pasta La Vista."
06:57;06:59;"Because, okay, that's strange."
06:59;07:03;"Because you're thinking a baked potato with a bolognese sauce would be nice."
07:03;07:04;"It'd be great. Absolutely."
07:04;07:05;"I'd be down."
07:05;07:09;"You know what I like? The last item on the first page of this menu is called The F*** It."
07:09;07:11;"The description is--"
07:11;07:13;"The F*** It?"
07:13;07:15;"Yeah, the F*** It. And it's not really a meal."
07:15;07:17;"It says, ""Not sure what you want? Let us choose for you."
07:17;07:20;"We'll ask you some questions at the register,"" with a smiling emoji."
07:20;07:21;"Oh, they're vibing."
07:21;07:24;"They interrogate you a little bit, and they help you find--"
07:24;07:26;"they help you locate the potato that's--"
07:26;07:28;"Okay, I like that, because that is pretty old school,"
07:28;07:29;"but I feel like the modern--"
07:29;07:31;"especially with apps and stuff,"
07:31;07:34;"and there's this increasingly antisocial behavior"
07:34;07:36;"and generations raised on the internet,"
07:36;07:39;"or at the very least an extreme type of shyness,"
07:39;07:41;"and you picture at so many restaurants,"
07:41;07:43;"and even Starbucks and stuff, people order online,"
07:43;07:47;"just run in, just grab it, like zero interaction."
07:47;07:49;"And then even a lot of places where they look at the menu,"
07:49;07:50;"and you just order it."
07:50;07:54;"The idea of actually coming in"
07:54;07:57;"and having a heart-to-heart with the person behind the counter"
07:57;07:59;"saying, ""Listen, I'm a little bit confused today."
07:59;08:01;"I want the f*** it."""
08:01;08:03;"""Oh, okay, you want the f*** it."
08:03;08:05;"All right, well, let me ask you a few questions."""
08:05;08:06;"""What kind of mood you in?"""
08:06;08:08;"[laughter]"
08:08;08:11;"""Well, I've had a real crappy day."""
08:11;08:13;"""Okay, so you're probably going to want something"
08:13;08:14;"a little bit sweet."
08:14;08:15;"You're going to want some comfort food,"
08:15;08:19;"maybe over a kind of diet baked potato?"""
08:19;08:21;"""Yeah, I just need something to improve my mood."
08:21;08:23;"I'm not calorie counting today."""
08:23;08:24;"""I want to indulge."""
08:24;08:26;"[laughter]"
08:26;08:29;"""I like the idea that you've gone to a hyper-specific..."""
08:29;08:30;"""It's free therapy."""
08:30;08:31;"""Yeah, exactly."""
08:31;08:33;"""It starts getting a little deeper."""
08:33;08:35;"""Hey, a life hack for people in Florida."
08:35;08:37;"Don't waste your money on therapy."
08:37;08:40;"Go down to the half-baked potato and get the f*** it."
08:40;08:42;"It's actually twice as effective."""
08:43;08:45;"Early in the morning,"
08:45;08:47;"rising to the street."
08:47;08:50;"Light me up that cigarette,"
08:50;08:52;"and I'll strap shoes on my feet."
08:52;08:55;"Try to find the reason,"
08:55;08:57;"the reason things went wrong."
08:57;09:02;"Got to find the reason why my money's on the bone."
09:02;09:07;"I got a Dalmatian that I could stick in her."
09:07;09:12;"I can play the guitar like a motherf***ing riot."
09:13;09:15;"The letter continues."
09:15;09:17;"""They have a lot of different baked potato creations."
09:17;09:19;"They also serve ramen randomly."""
09:19;09:20;"That's true."
09:20;09:21;"There's a little ramen section."
09:21;09:22;"""Wait, in the baked potato,"
09:22;09:24;"or that's just a different part of the menu?"""
09:24;09:26;"You can just get ramen."
09:26;09:28;"""Yeah, so they also,"
09:28;09:30;"they have a handful of other items."
09:30;09:33;"There's a ramen, pierogies, and hot dogs are also,"
09:33;09:35;"but it's like sort of a sub."
09:35;09:37;"It's like, that's not the main event, obviously."""
09:37;09:39;"Ramen, pierogies, hot dogs."
09:39;09:40;"They got a salad bar there?"
09:40;09:42;"""I'm not seeing any salad bar."
09:42;09:44;"Oh, they got a sushi roll."""
09:44;09:45;"Sushi?"
09:45;09:46;"""They've got a..."""
09:46;09:47;"Okay, this is just..."
09:47;09:48;"""Oh, they've got the Elvis,"
09:48;09:51;"which is peanut butter, bacon bits, and marshmallows."""
09:51;09:53;"Wait, wait, are we back to baked potatoes now?"
09:53;09:55;"""No, no, no, we're down in the hot dog section."""
09:55;09:57;"Oh, God."
09:57;09:58;"""There's a lot happening here."""
09:58;10:00;"Wait, what town is this in?"
10:00;10:02;"""It's in St. Petersburg, and it's 420 friendly."""
10:02;10:04;"Okay, I feel like that answers"
10:04;10:06;"a lot of the reasoning behind this."
10:06;10:07;"""Like, you walk in..."""
10:07;10:08;"Stoned as hell."
10:08;10:09;"""F*** it."""
10:09;10:10;"Blasted."
10:10;10:12;"""You're stoned out of your gourd."
10:12;10:14;"You walk in, and you go, 'F*** it,'"
10:14;10:15;"and they tell you what to eat."
10:15;10:17;"She writes, ""Please check out the quote,"
10:17;10:18;"'Pulled Pork Parfait,'"
10:18;10:21;"a take on the '90s snack, Dirt Cups,"

10:26;10:27;"Oh, sorry, go on, go on."
10:27;10:28;"""Well, I don't..."
10:28;10:29;"That's a good..."
10:29;10:30;"What is a Dirt Cup?"""
10:30;10:31;"I mean, when I say Dirt Cups,"
10:31;10:33;"I have vague memories of being in, like,"
10:33;10:35;"grade school,"
10:35;10:37;"and there's a thing that it was, like,"
10:37;10:40;"a fake cup of dirt with, like,"
10:40;10:42;"gummy worms in it,"
10:42;10:43;"and the dirt was made out of, like,"
10:43;10:45;"crumbly chocolate."
10:45;10:46;"""Is that a '90s thing? I don't..."""
10:46;10:49;"I mean, that does have '90s kid energy."
10:49;10:51;"""Guys, I gotta show you a photo"
10:51;10:54;"of the pasta la vista."""
10:54;10:55;"[laughing]"
10:55;10:56;"Oh, what?"
10:56;10:57;"""So it's..."
10:57;11:00;"I mean, it's a ton of angel hair pasta"
11:00;11:01;"with a bolognese,"
11:01;11:03;"and it looks like they've just thrown,"
11:03;11:05;"like, sort of shaved mozzarella,"
11:05;11:06;"like, from a bag."""
11:06;11:08;"I mean, I can barely see the potato under there."
11:08;11:11;"It looks like a plate of pasta from over here."
11:11;11:12;"I mean, here's what's tough"
11:12;11:14;"about these kind of restaurants is"
11:14;11:15;"that could be great,"
11:15;11:19;"but you have to make every element perfect."
11:19;11:20;"I'm gonna assume they know how to do"
11:20;11:21;"a really nice baked potato,"
11:21;11:23;"'cause that's their base here."
11:23;11:24;"But if you're gonna..."
11:24;11:26;"So you're just gonna have one ran--"
11:26;11:28;"a few random stoners,"
11:28;11:29;"just a few Florida deadheads"
11:29;11:31;"working behind the counter."
11:31;11:33;"Well, you're gonna need one person"
11:33;11:34;"who knows how to cook"
11:34;11:37;"perfectly al dente angel hair pasta."
11:37;11:38;"You're gonna need somebody else"
11:38;11:41;"who knows how to do Korean barbecue."
11:41;11:43;"You're gonna need a whole Iron Chef team"
11:43;11:45;"to really make this place work."
11:45;11:46;"They're just boiling some pasta"
11:46;11:48;"and dumping some ragu on there."
11:48;11:51;"All right, that doesn't sound good."
11:51;11:52;"You're gonna need somebody who really--"
11:52;11:54;"they have to have high-quality mozzarella"
11:54;11:55;"who really knows how to--"
11:55;11:57;"They need a sushi chef."
11:57;11:59;"Yes."
11:59;12:00;"Yeah."
12:00;12:02;"They need Jiro."
12:02;12:03;"They got Jiro back there."
12:03;12:08;"No, I like the Euros and sushi under the same roof."
12:08;12:10;"[laughter]"
12:10;12:12;"But I always think about these places"
12:12;12:14;"where they have--"
12:14;12:16;"I mean, it's a little bit like a diner"
12:16;12:18;"where there's, like, an endless menu."
12:18;12:19;"Yeah."
12:19;12:21;"And you know that 80% to 90%"
12:21;12:23;"of what they're cooking day in, day out"
12:23;12:26;"is maybe, like, 10 items."
12:26;12:28;"So you know that, you know,"
12:28;12:30;"when you roll in one of these days"
12:30;12:31;"and you're asking, you know,"
12:31;12:35;"for the Mongolian barbecue baked potato,"
12:35;12:36;"there's definitely somebody there"
12:36;12:38;"who's like, ""Oh, right."
12:38;12:40;"Yeah, [bleep] I haven't made this in three weeks."
12:40;12:42;"How do we do this one?"""
12:42;12:43;"You know what I mean?"
12:43;12:44;"It's not gonna be dialed in."
12:44;12:46;"It's very hard to nail all those things."
12:46;12:49;"That Dirt Cup pulled pork parfait,"
12:49;12:52;"it has flaming hot Cheetos and gummy worms on top."
12:52;12:54;"With pulled pork?"
12:54;12:56;"Yeah, I have to assume that's the base."
12:56;12:57;"Oh, why?"
12:57;12:58;"That's the dirt."
12:58;12:59;"Over the line."
12:59;13:01;"I mean, it's 420 friendly."
13:01;13:03;"They play '90s music and have"

13:17;13:18;"He seems like an interesting guy."
13:18;13:20;"Okay, maybe next time."
13:20;13:23;"I mean, I'm definitely interested in this place."
13:23;13:24;"I mean, this is what it..."
13:24;13:28;"I'm looking at all these photos of the dishes."
13:28;13:32;"It's basically the baked potato is..."
13:32;13:34;"It's basically the plate."
13:34;13:35;"Do you know what I mean?"
13:35;13:37;"It's like they're putting a whole meal"
13:37;13:39;"on top of the baked potato."
13:39;13:40;"Is the portion so large?"
13:40;13:41;"No, the portion's like..."
13:41;13:44;"Look, this one of Swedish meatballs"
13:44;13:49;"has two, four, six, eight, nine Swedish meatballs"
13:49;13:51;"on the baked potato."
13:51;13:52;"And I just have to show you,"
13:52;13:54;"this is the Elvis hot dog."
13:54;13:55;"Whoa!"
13:55;13:57;"Oh my God."
13:57;13:59;"Heads up."
13:59;14:01;"I mean, so what it does look like is that..."
14:01;14:03;"It's a hot dog with marshmallows."
14:03;14:06;"It looks like they threw a bunch of mini marshmallows"
14:06;14:09;"that you'd sort of put in like a hot cocoa."
14:09;14:12;"But it does look like they've taken a blowtorch"
14:12;14:13;"to the top of it,"
14:13;14:16;"the way you might in maybe a fancy restaurant or something,"
14:16;14:18;"where it's just like they've sort of toasted."
14:18;14:19;"Yeah, you kind of torch it."
14:19;14:20;"Caramelize it."
14:20;14:21;"They caramelize it."
14:21;14:24;"I mean, there's peanut butter on that hot dog?"
14:24;14:25;"Oh, yeah."
14:25;14:26;"That could almost be good."
14:26;14:28;"This, it's this substance."
14:28;14:30;"It's sort of this viscous substance."
14:30;14:31;"This viscous."

15:18;15:23;"Okay, now I understand why you keep telling us it's 420 friendly."
15:23;15:28;"Is that these are like kind of monstrous stoner creations"
15:28;15:31;"that you probably need to be high to eat."
15:31;15:35;"And there is something about when you're super blazed"
15:35;15:38;"that what you're looking for in food changes a bit."
15:38;15:42;"You do want an interesting mix of textures and flavors."
15:42;15:43;"And large quantities."
15:44;15:47;"Okay, so now I understand where they're coming from a bit."
15:47;15:51;"And I'm noticing that the menu has a subtle but large marijuana leaf"
15:51;15:53;"sort of like beneath everything."
15:53;15:56;"So this is like they're really true to the concept."
15:56;16:00;"My read is that the food is secondary to the concept."
16:00;16:03;"The baked potato is secondary to the toppings."
16:03;16:06;"You really got to dig, dig deep to get to the potato"
16:06;16:09;"at the core of this whole concept."
16:09;16:11;"So most people who dine there are just leaving"
16:11;16:17;"a kind of dirty baked potato on their plate."
16:17;16:21;"Well, that's why it's half baked because no one actually eats the potato."
16:21;16:22;"That's right."
16:22;16:24;"Because they don't actually have to cook it."
16:24;16:26;"Well, I would love to talk to the owner."
16:26;16:28;"I appreciate the creativity."
16:28;16:29;"I'm just curious how it's doing."
16:29;16:31;"What's the price point on this stuff?"
16:31;16:32;"Oh, great question."
16:32;16:34;"What's that pasta la vista going to run you?"
16:34;16:37;"All right, that pasta la vista is $14."
16:37;16:38;"Solid."
16:38;16:43;"It looks like pasta la vista is enough food for a two-person family."
16:43;16:44;"How are they doing?"
16:44;16:45;"I don't know."
16:45;16:46;"When do they open?"
16:46;16:47;"Let's see."
16:47;16:48;"Are there some Yelp reviews?"
16:48;16:49;"Let's find out."
16:49;16:52;"I also just feel like it does have the feeling of being"
16:52;16:56;"one or two many things going on on the mood board."
16:56;17:01;"For instance, if you were like, ""This is like an 80s and 90s themed restaurant."
17:01;17:10;"They play cartoons from the 80s and 90s, and you can get junky breakfast cereal."""
17:10;17:13;"Because sometimes you see these places that look kind of nasty."
17:13;17:17;"It's like, ""The cereal bar,"" and it's a kind of touristy, goofy place"
17:17;17:19;"you can go eat Captain Crunch or something."
17:19;17:22;"If you went there and they were--"
17:22;17:26;"You could understand how that'd be some kind of nostalgia throwback, goofy thing"
17:26;17:32;"for aging millennials to go eat some junky cereal and watch cartoons."
17:32;17:34;"If you said, ""420 friendly,"" sure."
17:34;17:37;"Roll up late night, eat Froot Loops, and watch--"
17:37;17:40;"But this restaurant is like, ""You got to be blazed."
17:40;17:43;"You got to be absolutely wrecked."""
17:43;17:45;"It does feel like there's a dark--"
17:45;17:48;"There's almost a dark energy walking into this place,"
17:48;17:50;"and it's just full of zombies."
17:50;17:53;"We open at 10 p.m."
17:53;17:57;"So high they can't talk to each other, and they're all just digging in."
17:57;17:59;"They're all like, ""Do these--"""
17:59;18:02;"This place is like--"
18:02;18:07;"I kind of love it that it goes beyond the rational mind"
18:07;18:10;"because we can understand the nostalgia of the 420,"
18:10;18:15;"but then they throw in this baked potato element, kind of for no reason."
18:15;18:16;"Baked potatoes."
18:16;18:21;"Jake, to your question, half-baked potato has five stars on Yelp."
18:21;18:22;"Hell yeah."
18:22;18:23;"12 reviews."
18:23;18:24;"That's good."
18:24;18:25;"It's doing solid."
18:25;18:26;"Do you want to read one or two?"
18:26;18:27;"Yeah, yeah."
18:27;18:30;"I mean, I think there's a good representation here."
18:30;18:34;"Krista V wrote in April, ""As someone who loves potatoes,"
18:34;18:38;"I was excited to also see that they offer ramen and hot dogs,"
18:38;18:41;"two of my other favorites."""
18:41;18:44;"It was my first time trying, and I ordered online for pickup."
18:44;18:47;"When I walked in to get my order, I was greeted like a friend,"
18:47;18:49;"and I so appreciate that."
18:49;18:51;"The staff was so friendly and warm and even told me about some things"
18:51;18:53;"they have in the works."
18:53;18:54;"Okay."
18:54;18:58;"""So to get to my order, I tried the pork ramen with an added egg."""
18:58;19:02;"So this person, they love potatoes, but they've gone ramen first"
19:02;19:04;"on their first try."
19:04;19:06;"""It was super delicious."
19:06;19:08;"I've never had ramen with pulled pork, but it was really nice"
19:08;19:10;"and added a unique flavor."
19:10;19:11;"The egg was cooked and seasoned perfectly."
19:11;19:12;"The broth was amazing."
19:12;19:13;"I loved it all."
19:13;19:14;"I will definitely be coming back."""
19:14;19:15;"Maybe that answers my question."
19:15;19:16;"This is a home run."
19:16;19:20;"Because if every item is not--and every element is not done perfectly,"
19:20;19:21;"this is going to be a disaster."
19:21;19:24;"But if they actually have somebody who knows how to get the egg"
19:24;19:28;"just right for ramen and knows how to cook the pork just right,"
19:28;19:30;"it really comes down to the people."
19:30;19:32;"And it sounds like it's a friendly group of people."
19:32;19:34;"Because here's the thing."
19:34;19:37;"You can't be walking into a place like the Half-Baked Potato"
19:37;19:41;"and get some kind of sullen stoner."
19:41;19:42;"That'd be terrible."
19:42;19:44;"You'd walk in and some guy's like, ""Yeah?"""
19:44;19:48;"And you're just like, ""Um, can I get the Elvis hot dog?"""
19:48;19:49;"""What?"""
19:49;19:52;"""Oh, wait, which one is--okay, hold on."""
19:52;19:53;"That's going to kill the vibe."
19:53;19:57;"You need to walk in with friendly, motivated stoners"
19:57;20:00;"who maybe have worked in some pretty high-class restaurants."
20:00;20:03;"And it sounds like maybe that's what's going on here."

21:26;21:27;"I mean, that's a day."
21:27;21:29;"That's a St. Petersburg day."
21:29;21:31;"- As far as I'm concerned. - I love that this is in Florida."
21:31;21:33;"- Yeah, St. Petersburg on-- - Hot-ass Florida."
21:33;21:34;"On the beach?"
21:34;21:35;"Yeah."
21:35;21:36;"Is it Gulfside?"

21:37;21:38;"I'm pretty sure--"

21:48;21:50;"- Choose one-- - Coastal. So--"
21:50;21:52;"- I do have to say-- - That sounds kind as hell, man."
21:52;21:54;"On the-- What do you think this means?"
21:54;21:56;"So on the menu,"
21:56;21:59;"if I sort of, you know, pushed in a bit,"
21:59;22:01;"it says, ""Choose one of our signature potatoes"
22:01;22:04;"or BYO on the backside."""
22:04;22:07;"Does that mean you can-- You bring your own potato?"
22:07;22:08;"- BYO. - BYO."
22:08;22:10;"Choose one of our signature potatoes"
22:10;22:12;"or, oh, build your own."
22:12;22:13;"Oh, build your own."
22:13;22:15;"Yeah, I was like, what's the backside?"
22:15;22:17;"On the backside?"
22:17;22:18;"I don't know. On the backside."
22:18;22:20;"Like on the-- Like low-key?"
22:20;22:22;"It's like a hack."

22:35;22:37;"green onions, and sour cream."

22:42;22:44;"- Let me get the-- - Ideas are a dime a dozen."
22:44;22:46;"- It's all about execution. - Yeah."
22:46;22:48;"I'm still tripping out on the sushi,"
22:48;22:50;"just like the guy being like,"

23:14;23:16;"Well, the half-baked potato,"

23:18;23:19;"the more I like it."
23:19;23:21;"But why--"
23:21;23:24;"It still seems so random that they chose"
23:24;23:26;"baked potato as their"
23:26;23:28;"kind of unifying principle."
23:28;23:30;"Would a vampire play Tampa?"
23:30;23:32;"We actually have a great number of cards."
23:32;23:34;"We played St. Petersburg back in the day."
23:34;23:36;"Would we play Tampa?"
23:36;23:39;"I mean, in a heartbeat, I'd be open to the idea."
23:39;23:41;"Is there, like, a venue that we would play?"
23:41;23:43;"Wait, we played--"
23:43;23:45;"Did we just play St. Petersburg?"
23:45;23:47;"First result on setlist.fm"
23:47;23:51;"is you played Janice Live"
23:51;23:53;"in 2010"
23:53;23:55;"- on a Contra tour. - Yeah, that sounds familiar."
23:55;23:57;"With Beach House."
23:57;23:59;"Seems like it's been a minute."
23:59;24:01;"Well, maybe talk to your tour manager"
24:01;24:03;"about getting you routed through Tampa next time."
24:03;24:06;"- Make sure there's time allotted. - And I'm a rider."
24:06;24:08;"I'd love to hit Tampa."
24:08;24:09;"- I just don't think we ever-- - Half-baked."
24:09;24:11;"- I just don't think we ever-- - Oh, yeah, backstage."
24:11;24:13;"Hit Tampa. So, okay, we have played St. Petersburg,"
24:13;24:14;"so maybe we'll go back."
24:14;24:16;"Maybe. And, yeah, what do you think the vibe's gonna be"
24:16;24:18;"when people come to visit you backstage"
24:18;24:21;"and it's just full of half-baked potatoes?"
24:21;24:23;"I wonder if they have a mobile rig."
24:23;24:25;"They got to."
24:25;24:27;"We're just having a killer party."
24:27;24:30;"Oh, you were in Tampa 2014"
24:30;24:34;"on the Modern Vampires of the City tour."
24:34;24:37;"You played the Mid-Florida Credit Union Amphitheater."
24:37;24:40;"- Oh, yeah, that sounds familiar. - That is a great name."
24:40;24:44;"Mid-Florida Credit Union Amphitheater."
24:44;24:47;"I've never heard that term, ""mid-Florida."""
24:47;24:51;"We've definitely played a few credit union events."
24:51;24:53;"- Respect. - Oh, yeah."
24:53;24:55;"No, we had a great show in St. Augustine."
24:55;24:58;"Yeah, sometimes I get St. Augustine, St. Petersburg confused."
24:58;25:02;"In August 2019, we hit the St. Augustine Amphitheater"
25:02;25:03;"in St. Augustine, Florida,"
25:03;25:05;"but that's, like, the totally different side of Florida."
25:05;25:09;"- That's, like, way north. - North and on the Atlantic coast."
25:09;25:12;"All right, I'm gonna make sure we hit St. Pete's again"

26:58;27:00;"and I made some reference to Larry Norman,"
27:00;27:05;"who was, you know, widely credited as the father of Christian rock."
27:05;27:08;"And he started releasing records in the late '60s and early '70s."
27:08;27:11;"And you know me, I was just immediately like, ""What's that?"""
27:11;27:12;"Yeah, what's..."
27:12;27:16;"Like, the origins of Christian rock in the late '60s."
27:16;27:17;"Right."
27:17;27:19;"I remember the description was sort of like,"
27:19;27:21;"FM, like, rock from that era,"
27:21;27:24;"like FM radio rock from that era."
27:24;27:27;"Like it would fit right in with classic rock kind of palettes,"
27:27;27:31;"except for the subject matter and the lyrics."
27:31;27:32;"Yeah, so I don't know."
27:32;27:33;"I just have been always..."
27:33;27:35;"I made like a Larry Norman playlist."
27:35;27:38;"And I just thought his story was really interesting."
27:38;27:41;"I watched a doc that was on Amazon"
27:41;27:45;"that was made a few years ago that is low budge, but pretty good."
27:45;27:48;"And I mean, basically, like,"
27:48;27:51;"he was a dude that grew up in the South Bay"
27:51;27:54;"and he first had a band called People,"
27:54;27:56;"which had like kind of like a..."
27:56;27:57;"Great name for a band."
27:57;27:59;"Yeah, People with an exclamation point."
27:59;28:01;"And like, they had like some popularity."
28:01;28:03;"They like toured with The Who"
28:03;28:05;"and like opened for Hendrix and The Dead."
28:05;28:09;"Played The Matrix a bunch."
28:09;28:10;"Oh, in SF."
28:10;28:11;"Yeah."
28:11;28:12;"Freaky."
28:12;28:14;"And Larry had like, he was, you know,"
28:14;28:15;"had been a Christian his whole life."
28:15;28:17;"He wanted to name the first People record,"
28:17;28:21;"""We Need a Lot More Jesus and a Lot Less Rock and Roll."""
28:21;28:24;"And the other guys in the band were like,"
28:24;28:27;"""Um, I don't know about that, dude."""
28:27;28:28;"And then they were signed to Capitol"
28:28;28:31;"and Capitol was like, ""Yeah, not a good album title."""
28:31;28:35;"And then the band kind of split up over religious differences"
28:35;28:38;"because the other guys in the band were all Scientologists."
28:38;28:39;"Oh!"
28:39;28:42;"And so Larry like moves down to LA."
28:42;28:45;"Larry, you're too far out with this Jesus stuff, man."
28:45;28:47;"Yeah. Have you heard of Zinu?"
28:47;28:49;"Have you heard the good word?"
28:49;28:51;"So then Larry moves down to LA in like '68"
28:51;28:54;"and he still has a deal with Capitol."
28:54;28:57;"And he records an album, his first album,"
28:57;28:59;"called ""Upon This Rock,"" which is widely credited"
28:59;29:03;"as like the first straight up Christian rock record."
29:03;29:06;"Came out on Capitol Records in '69, I think."
29:06;29:08;"But he would spend like all day"
29:08;29:11;"just like walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard,"
29:11;29:13;"not with like a bullhorn or anything,"
29:13;29:16;"but just like trying to spread the good word."
29:16;29:18;"Like that's how he spent his days."
29:18;29:20;"And then he would like play gigs."
29:20;29:21;"Wow."
29:21;29:25;"He had like a very contentious relationship with the church"
29:25;29:27;"and with like organized religion."
29:27;29:30;"His songs weren't just like, ""God is great."""
29:30;29:33;"It was much more like deep into like scripture"
29:33;29:35;"and like the darker elements of the Bible"
29:35;29:37;"and like judgment day is coming."
29:37;29:38;"Whoa."
29:38;29:40;"And like, you have to get your soul in order"
29:40;29:42;"or you're gonna burn in hell."
29:42;29:44;"Like that's what a lot of his songs are."
29:44;29:47;"So a lot of like the Christian youth groups and stuff"
29:47;29:49;"that he would play for were just like,"
29:49;29:50;"""This is too heavy."""
29:50;29:52;"And plus he was bringing like,"
29:52;29:54;"the reason I like Larry Norman is that his music"
29:54;29:55;"is like good."
29:55;29:57;"Like I will throw on Larry Norman"
29:57;30:01;"for non-anthropological reasons."
30:01;30:03;"I got into him because I was like,"
30:03;30:05;"""What's the deal with early Christian rock?"""
30:05;30:07;"Right, but he's actually, he can really play."
30:07;30:08;"He's a great writer."
30:08;30:10;"But anyway, I found this thing online"
30:10;30:12;"that was like a memoir he wrote."
30:12;30:15;"And I pulled a few quotes that were kind of interesting"
30:15;30:18;"about his mindset in the late 60s."
30:18;30:21;"So just picture like ""What's Upon a Time in Hollywood?"""
30:21;30:24;"And it's like Brad Pitt's at like a stoplight"
30:24;30:25;"on like Hollywood Boulevard."
30:25;30:26;"And then in the background,"
30:26;30:29;"there's just like this long haired Jesus looking dude."
30:29;30:30;"Right."
30:30;30:34;"Who's just like talking to someone about the good Lord."
30:34;30:35;"So Larry's vibe was like,"
30:35;30:37;"""Yet at the same time, I had very little interest"
30:37;30:40;"in cultivating endorsements from the church."
30:40;30:41;"I was out to create a dialogue"
30:41;30:44;"with people who believe they hated God."
30:44;30:46;"I wanted to be on the battlefield,"
30:46;30:48;"fighting a spiritual battle,"
30:48;30:50;"trying to convince and convert the undecided"
30:50;30:52;"and to get them to cross the battle line"
30:52;30:55;"to stand together with other new believers."
30:55;30:56;"Though I may have been an error"
30:56;30:58;"in standing aside from the brethren"
30:58;31:00;"by not performing for them,"
31:00;31:03;"the established church was simply immaterial to me."
31:03;31:05;"I had been witnessing since I was in primary school"
31:05;31:08;"and now in Los Angeles, up and down Hollywood Boulevard."
31:08;31:11;"In 1968, I spent all of my concert income"
31:11;31:15;"on establishing and maintaining a Christian halfway house."
31:15;31:17;"I had played at the Troubadour and the Hollywood Bowl,"
31:17;31:20;"witnessing before and after the performances"
31:20;31:22;"on the streets during the day"
31:22;31:24;"and to the people after the shows."
31:24;31:25;"When I was working the boulevards,"
31:25;31:27;"I never mentioned that I played guitar,"
31:27;31:29;"wrote songs, had made records."
31:29;31:32;"My encounters were one-on-one, quiet and personal."
31:32;31:34;"I did not hand out Bible tracks"
31:34;31:37;"and try to preach on the sidewalk through a bullhorn."
31:37;31:39;"I waited until I felt God was saying,"
31:39;31:41;"""Go talk to this person."""
31:41;31:42;"And so then after a while, he did,"
31:42;31:45;"like, I guess there were a lot of Christian coffee houses"
31:45;31:48;"in the early '70s, which was interesting to read about."
31:48;31:50;"So he started playing some of those."
31:50;31:51;"He goes, ""When I'd finally played"
31:51;31:54;"""in Christian coffee houses, it was somewhat of a vacation,"
31:54;31:56;"""a nice change from bashing my head"
31:56;31:59;"""against the cultural, secular wall for a short time."
31:59;32:01;"""I was getting weary of trying to be heard"
32:01;32:03;"""by the hate-ashberry crowd."
32:03;32:05;"""I'd opened for Jimi Hendrix, the Doors,"
32:05;32:08;"""the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, the Byrds,"
32:08;32:10;"""and found no one backstage who was interested"
32:10;32:12;"""in anything beyond their own fame"
32:12;32:14;"""and whatever free drugs were available."
32:14;32:17;"""The audiences out front seemed to be stoned"
32:17;32:19;"""even before they showed up at the Fillmore,"
32:19;32:22;"""the Matrix, or the Avalon Ballroom."""
32:22;32:26;"So just picture him backstage, opening for the dead,"
32:26;32:28;"and just running into Phil Lash and being like,"
32:28;32:29;"""Hey, brother."""
32:29;32:31;"(laughing)"
32:31;32:33;"- Phil is just like, ""I'm just trying to score some hash, man."""
32:33;32:35;"And it's also interesting to think, too,"
32:35;32:39;"I think this is true in a lot of movements and moments."
32:39;32:43;"Sometimes, even with a very fervent movement,"
32:43;32:45;"like the hippie movement, you're still gonna get"
32:45;32:47;"some really disappointed true believers."
32:47;32:50;"'Cause imagine you're this long-haired dude"
32:50;32:55;"and you have this deep relationship to God, Christ, whatever."
32:55;32:57;"In your own counter-cultural way,"
32:57;32:59;"you're saying he wasn't into the church."
32:59;33:02;"In a really deep way, you see all these long-haired,"
33:02;33:05;"quote-unquote, Jesus-looking people come together"
33:05;33:08;"to open up a new age of peace, love, and understanding."
33:08;33:11;"You're probably thinking, ""Wow, I'm literally living"
33:11;33:14;"""through prophecy. This is amazing."""
33:14;33:15;"- Yeah."
33:15;33:17;"- People are opening their mind to bigger ideas."
33:17;33:19;"And then I can totally see that you're like,"
33:19;33:21;"""And this is where it's at. I'm at the center of it."
33:21;33:24;"""This is amazing. Everything's coming together."""
33:24;33:26;"And then you actually go to the show"
33:26;33:31;"and you still see normal showbiz vibes."
33:31;33:33;"You just see people kind of whacked out on drugs."
33:33;33:35;"And you're just like, kind of--"
33:35;33:36;"You could see how a guy like that would be"
33:36;33:37;"just pretty disappointed."
33:37;33:38;"- Yeah."
33:38;33:40;"- Everything about that movement probably looked"
33:40;33:42;"like exactly what he was hoping for in life."
33:42;33:46;"This perfect combination of Jesus-type ideals"
33:46;33:48;"plus cool music."
33:48;33:49;"And then he gets in the middle of it"
33:49;33:50;"and he can't really find it."
33:50;33:52;"Must have been very disappointing."
33:52;33:55;"- Yeah. No, I mean, you know, like with this show,"
33:55;33:58;"whether we're talking about ""Mad Men"" or anything else,"
33:58;34:01;"that moment of the '60s idealism,"
34:01;34:04;"""Curtling,"" yeah, like Eagle songs, Don Henley songs."
34:04;34:05;"- Right."
34:05;34:08;"- And then this was another strand of that."
34:08;34:09;"- Right."
34:09;34:10;"- ""I'm Not Afraid You're a Hippie."""
34:10;34:13;"I mean, yeah, 'cause a lot of hippies became Christians."
34:13;34:14;"- Right."
34:14;34:15;"It's a very logical step."
34:15;34:18;"- And I listened to some other Christian rock from the era"
34:18;34:19;"and it's like, it's just like,"
34:19;34:21;"it's very like forgettable music."
34:21;34:22;"- Mm."
34:22;34:23;"- Wait, so why don't we listen to--"
34:23;34:24;"- Yeah, we should--"
34:24;34:25;"- Just start at the top."
34:25;34:26;"- ""UFO""?"
34:26;34:27;"- ""UFO."""
34:27;34:28;"- I know you've sent this to me"
34:28;34:29;"and I've listened to some of this before,"
34:29;34:31;"but I don't totally remember,"
34:31;34:32;"but I'm interested."
34:32;34:35;"Why is the father of Christian rock"
34:35;34:37;"writing a song called ""UFO""?"
34:37;34:39;"I'm very interested to hear."
34:39;34:42;"(soft music)"
34:42;34:44;"So what year is this?"
34:44;34:47;"- This is like, I think '76."

42:18;42:21;"The string arrangement, it's a little bit like Nico."
42:21;42:22;"Christian Nico."

42:24;42:25;"- Yeah, I just..."
42:25;42:28;"Something about his aesthetic is so..."
42:28;42:30;"He's a great songwriter."
42:30;42:34;"And it's coming out of the same aesthetic ferment of..."
42:34;42:35;"- A lot of classics."
42:35;42:36;"- So much classics."

43:12;43:15;"♪ You've been left behind ♪"
43:15;43:19;"- I wonder if Elvis heard Larry Norman."
43:19;43:21;"- Interesting."
43:21;43:25;"- I was reading that Frank Black from the Pixies"
43:25;43:28;"is a huge Larry Norman head."
43:28;43:30;"And apparently when Larry Norman died,"
43:30;43:32;"he was working on a record with Frank Black"
43:32;43:35;"and Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse."
43:35;43:36;"- Whoa."
43:36;43:38;"- And then I was reading this other thing too,"
43:38;43:41;"like U2 famously, like a low-key Christian band."
43:41;43:42;"- Right."
43:42;43:46;"- How Bono had met with all these Nashville songwriters"
43:46;43:50;"back in the early 2000s before Larry Norman died."
43:50;43:51;"And he showed up and he's like,"
43:51;43:53;"""Is Larry Norman gonna come?"""
43:53;43:54;"He asked for Larry Norman."
43:54;43:55;"- 'Cause he knew this music?"
43:55;43:56;"- Yeah."
43:56;43:57;"- Like what we've been listening to?"
43:57;43:58;"- Bono apparently."
43:58;43:59;"- It just circulated and--"
43:59;44:00;"- Yeah."
44:00;44:01;"- I guess in the Christian scene."
44:01;44:02;"- Yeah."
44:02;44:04;"I think that last record he made from,"
44:04;44:06;"or not the last, he made a ton of,"
44:06;44:09;"his career gets very confusing as the '80s progressed"
44:09;44:12;"'cause there's a ton of sort of like bootlegs"
44:12;44:16;"and like re-releases and like every album"
44:16;44:19;"like after the first four, you would read about it"
44:19;44:23;"and there'd be like a three-year protracted legal battle."
44:23;44:26;"Like every album was on like a different label."
44:26;44:29;"His career sort of became like very hard to track."
44:29;44:31;"- And he was living in London for a while."
44:31;44:33;"- Yeah, he moved to London."
44:33;44:35;"Apparently went to a lot of punk shows."
44:35;44:36;"- Oh, so open-minded guy."
44:36;44:37;"- Yeah."
44:37;44:39;"- He says he saw Richard Hell and the Voidoids,"
44:39;44:41;"The Damned and the Dead Boys."
44:41;44:44;"He initially disliked the lyrical content of punk."
44:44;44:46;"He was supportive of its youthful energy"
44:46;44:47;"and preferred it to disco."
44:47;44:48;"Interesting."
44:48;44:50;"(laughing)"
44:50;44:51;"And like, did he have a family?"
44:51;44:53;"You know anything about that?"
44:53;44:55;"- I know he was married."
44:55;44:57;"I don't know if he had children."
44:57;44:59;"You would think he would have,"
44:59;45:00;"being a Christian man and all."
45:00;45:01;"- Right."
45:01;45:04;"- I don't know if he had any crossover with Elvis,"
45:04;45:07;"though many articles call him the Elvis of Christian rock."
45:07;45:09;"I mean, that's sort of how he's known."
45:09;45:11;"- Yeah, the John Lennon of Christian rock,"
45:11;45:12;"the Elvis of Christian rock."
45:12;45:13;"- But he did write a song--"
45:13;45:14;"- He was the king of rock of Christian rock."
45:14;45:15;"- Yes."
45:15;45:19;"- But he did write a song called Elvis Has Left the Building."
45:19;45:20;"- Oh, wow."
45:20;45:21;"Let's check it out."
45:21;45:23;"I wonder if it's like late period Larry."
45:23;45:24;"- It's definitely--"
45:24;45:25;"- See, but it's weird--"
45:25;45:27;"- It's definitely a late period Larry."
45:27;45:28;"- Oh, hell yeah."
45:28;45:30;"His look is also awesome."
45:30;45:32;"Just like bangs with like the long blonde hair."
45:32;45:33;"- Long blonde hair."
45:33;45:35;"- But like people call him like the Elvis"
45:35;45:37;"or the John Lennon of Christian rock,"
45:37;45:40;"but those are like beloved figures."
45:40;45:43;"Like Larry was, his, everything I was reading,"
45:43;45:46;"it just, he seemed like he had a very contagious relationship"
45:46;45:48;"with like his audience and like--"
45:48;45:50;"- Yeah, that's not an appropriate comparison."
45:50;45:51;"- The record industry."
45:51;45:53;"Yeah, it's like, it's much, it's too like,"
45:53;45:54;"he's too like embittered."
45:54;45:57;"- Right, and I imagine, you know,"
45:57;45:58;"I don't totally know here,"
45:58;46:02;"but I imagine in the 60s was the start of kind of like"
46:02;46:05;"alternative forms of Christianity taking hold."
46:05;46:08;"So probably like you were saying that a lot of the church"
46:08;46:11;"denounced him and you could imagine by like the 90s"
46:11;46:14;"when you have these really big Christian rock bands,"
46:14;46:17;"the DC Talks or whoever bands that we've all at least heard of,"
46:17;46:19;"you can imagine by then,"
46:19;46:21;"like the counterculture had done its thing"
46:21;46:24;"and probably anybody in a power position at a church"
46:24;46:26;"by the 90s would just welcome"
46:26;46:29;"any sort of alternative Christianity thing"
46:29;46:31;"that might win back the youth."
46:31;46:33;"- Yeah, something that had some like cache"
46:33;46:35;"in like cultural circles."
46:35;46:38;"- Right, and even if it was like a little bit out there,"
46:38;46:40;"well, let's check this out."
46:40;46:41;"Elvis has left the building."
46:41;46:44;"This is from, this is from '94."

49:31;49:33;"I was like looking for something to watch"
49:33;49:34;"on a streaming service."
49:34;49:35;"- As you do."
49:35;49:36;"- As one does."
49:36;49:38;"And I randomly saw this movie"
49:38;49:42;"I'd never seen, a 1990 film called Miami Blues"
49:42;49:44;"starring Alec Baldwin."
49:44;49:45;"- Not familiar."
49:45;49:47;"- Very weird movie."
49:47;49:49;"He plays this kind of like insane guy"
49:49;49:50;"who just got out of prison,"
49:50;49:53;"he just lands in Miami and just immediately"
49:53;49:55;"kills someone at the airport."
49:55;49:57;"It's very weird, he's like a nut."
49:57;49:58;"- Did you watch the whole movie?"
49:58;50:00;"- I watched the whole movie, but it opens,"
50:00;50:02;"you would enjoy it, it's like a weird time capsule"
50:02;50:04;"and it's like 1990 Miami."
50:04;50:05;"- Wow."
50:05;50:06;"- Very gritty."
50:06;50:07;"- I would love to see this."
50:07;50:09;"- Anyway, the movie opens and closes"
50:09;50:12;"with Spirit in the Sky, which I hadn't heard in a while."
50:12;50:14;"I don't know too much about this song."
50:14;50:16;"The song you always hear is that this guy's named"
50:16;50:18;"Norman Greenbaum, super Jewish name."
50:18;50:19;"- Yeah."
50:19;50:20;"- And he's like a Jewish guy who just like"
50:20;50:22;"wrote this song, just like came to him."
50:22;50:24;"'Cause it's all about Jesus."
50:24;50:26;"And you really listen to it and it's like"
50:26;50:27;"such cool tones."
50:27;50:31;"(guitar music)"
50:31;50:34;"- Is that like a guitar?"
50:34;50:36;"- I guess, and there's this part."
50:36;50:37;"- Yeah, let's see."

51:05;51:07;"yeah, we'll see, we'll see if you go up there."
51:07;51:11;"Why don't you tell me what you did in your life, Norman?"
51:11;51:13;"- Norman, have you repented?"
51:13;51:15;"- Total one hit wonder, too."
51:15;51:17;"- Yeah, wonder what he did."
51:17;51:19;"- I think he kinda retired from music."
51:19;51:21;"- Sort of like a Martin Quintington style."

52:06;52:08;"- Oh, this is from '69?"
52:08;52:10;"Wait, did he invent glam rock?"

01:00:41;01:00:44;"He noticed that Van asked the band to take long solos."

01:00:48;01:00:50;"'He's so deeply moved by the music.'"

01:01:42;01:01:44;"Because this is a banked up,"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"we're not trying to hide it, it's a banked up."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"A recently banked up."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"So rather than do the top five"
01:01:51;01:01:54;"for whatever day we're recording this,"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"we decided to do something a little more evergreen."
01:01:56;01:02:00;"Now, producer Matt pulled the top alternative songs"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"from the weeks each of us turned 18."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"The alternative songs chart, by the way,"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"was known as the Modern Rock Charts before 2009."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- Modern Rock."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- So this is more like the Modern Rock songs"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"from when we turned 18."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"This is the moment that we officially entered adulthood."
01:02:17;01:02:22;"This is what we were jamming on alternative radio."
01:02:22;01:02:27;"- So this is 1995 and 2002 or one?"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"- So you turned 18--"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"- In '95, February of '95."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"- And I did in April 2002."
01:02:37;01:02:42;"- Okay, I think mine is gonna absolutely mop the floor."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"- '95 versus 2002, I mean, the truth is--"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- I'm gonna crush."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"- Mid '90s."
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- Yeah, it's gonna crush."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"I mean, the truth is,"
01:02:52;01:02:57;"I probably listened to alternative radio more often"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"when I was 11 in 1995."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"By 2002, I'm trying to even remember"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"what was going on musically then."
01:03:03;01:03:08;"By 2002, I was pretty deep into everything."
01:03:08;01:03:12;"I wasn't guided by the radio, not to brag, but just like--"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"- No, you were a music nerd."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- I was a music nerd."
01:03:15;01:03:21;"I was buying deep records and CDs and going to other music."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- And the stuff on the radio sucked in 2002."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"- It was getting worse and worse."
01:03:26;01:03:31;"And I feel like even my local station, K-Rock,"
01:03:31;01:03:34;"not to be confused with K-R-O-Q in LA,"
01:03:34;01:03:36;"but K-Rock, R-O-C-K in New York,"
01:03:36;01:03:40;"I feel like that had almost changed formats at that point."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"Maybe not quite, but yeah, in 2002 also,"
01:03:43;01:03:48;"I vividly remember, let's see, in 2000,"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"my slightly older buddy, Andre,"
01:03:51;01:03:55;"who I mentioned in the last episode, works at Dimes,"
01:03:55;01:03:59;"he went to college for a semester at BU,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"and I went to visit him."
01:04:01;01:04:06;"So he was a freshman at BU, probably fall 2000."
01:04:06;01:04:09;"And I took the train to Boston,"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"and we hung out for a weekend."
01:04:11;01:04:15;"And I vividly remember him showing me Napster"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"for the first time."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"Or maybe at Soul Seek,"
01:04:18;01:04:22;"that was kind of like a cooler file sharing service."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"So I kind of remember by 2000,"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"being in early file sharing era,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"and like, what music?"
01:04:30;01:04:34;"He was probably listening to all sorts of weird stuff,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"Auditor, Warp Records,"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"and he liked some deep stuff,"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"Momus and Piano Magic."
01:04:40;01:04:43;"Just by 2002, I was already a few years deep"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"into this alternate universe of record stores, Soul Seek,"
01:04:47;01:04:50;"just a slightly wider spectrum."
01:04:50;01:04:53;"But I still was interested in what was going on then."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"But yeah, when I think of 2002,"
01:04:55;01:05:00;"it feels like a much less classic era than '95."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"But let's see."
01:05:01;01:05:08;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:05:08;01:05:12;"Okay, so we're going to start with the number five song,"
01:05:12;01:05:16;"Jake, in your year, Bush, Everything Zen."
01:05:16;01:05:19;"Is that a strong start in your worldview?"
01:05:19;01:05:22;"I think it's going to be strong in context"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"to what's going to come in 2002."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"I think at the time, I thought Bush was pretty weak."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Right."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"But then when we get into like Hoobastank or something,"
01:05:32;01:05:37;"Bush is going to sound like the kinks in comparison."
01:05:37;01:05:39;"And I'll point out, I had this CD."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"There's something about, I liked a few Bush songs,"
01:05:42;01:05:45;"but I feel like maybe I got it through Columbia House or something."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"I feel like you probably,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"yeah, I could totally imagine you hearing Bush"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"and just being like you remember when Nevermind came out"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"and you're probably like, ""Bush sucks."""
01:05:54;01:05:57;"I don't know why, where I grew up, everybody had this CD."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Everybody had 16 Stone."
01:05:59;01:06:03;"This was like, sad to say, this was like Nevermind."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"I never owned this, but yeah."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"This is like Nevermind for silverback millennials."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"Absolutely."
01:06:10;01:06:14;"I feel like this album was produced by Steve Albini."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"It sounds pretty good."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"No, my bad. It wasn't."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"Steve Albini produced Razorblade Suitcase,"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"which is the one album."
01:06:22;01:06:29;"This actually sounds great."
01:06:29;01:06:41;"So this is the first Bush hit, I think."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"I think so."
01:06:44;01:06:47;"I should have thought of those."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"Great lyrics."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"Days on set again"
01:06:52;01:06:56;"We kiss the kiss in the rearview"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"We're so bored you're to blame"
01:06:59;01:07:04;"Trust you once, my wife"
01:07:04;01:07:09;"Everything's in, everything's in"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"I don't think so"
01:07:12;01:07:16;"Everything's in, everything's in"
01:07:16;01:07:19;"I don't think so"
01:07:19;01:07:26;"It's not bad."
01:07:26;01:07:29;"I mean, Glycerine's a better song."
01:07:29;01:07:32;"The rain dogs howl for the century"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"A million dollars at stake"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"I'm pretty into these verse hits."
01:07:36;01:07:40;"It is kind of interesting, like, cut up, weird lyrics."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"You fake we're the saints"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"There's no sex in your violence"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"Oh, yeah."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"There's no sex in your violence"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"What the hell does that mean?"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"There's no sex in your violence"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"There's no sex in your violence"
01:07:57;01:08:01;"Trust you once, my wife"
01:08:01;01:08:07;"Everything's in, everything's in"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"I don't think so"
01:08:10;01:08:14;"Everything's in, everything's in"

01:08:40;01:08:43;"I don't believe that Elvis is dead"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"Well, talk to Larry Norman."
01:08:45;01:08:48;"I don't believe that Elvis is dead, yeah"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"I don't believe that Elvis is"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Elvis is"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Pretty weak bridge there."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"I don't believe that Elvis is dead"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Yeah, Elvis is as young as it does"
01:09:02;01:09:05;"Twist yourself like a pretzel"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:09:07;01:09:12;"This is so '90s."

01:09:20;01:09:30;"And what's the story with Bush?"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"They weren't very popular in the UK, only in the US."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"I think so."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"Which is the reverse of like, cool bands."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Right."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"I mean the opposite of Oasis."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"I mean Oasis is popular here, but"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"No, that's that huge part of them"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"Oh, can you, yeah, you know, you saw the documentary when they show up here"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"They're so famous in the UK"
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"And then they show up in America"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"And nobody really knows who they are"
01:09:57;01:10:00;"The first Oasis tour in like '94 or whatever it was"
01:10:00;01:10:04;"They were playing like, bars that like, my band played"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Seven years later, you know"
01:10:06;01:10:23;"The title is believed to be inspired by Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Hell"""
01:10:23;01:10:27;"Which includes the line ""who vanished into nowhere's then New Jersey"""
01:10:27;01:10:30;"Gavin Ross didn't want to talk about New Jersey"
01:10:30;01:10:41;"The lyrics reference songs from David Bowie, Tom Waits, Jane's Addiction and Alice in Chains"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"I don't know what the AIC ref is"
01:10:43;01:10:47;"Were you guys aware that in Canada, Bush is called Bush X?"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"Oh, why? Is there a Canadian band called Bush?"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Yeah, and they got into a dispute and so"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Bush X?"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"That album had to be released as Bush X"
01:10:56;01:11:00;"And I remember being in Canada and everybody was sort of like, ""Oh, that's so lame"""
01:11:00;01:11:04;"Oh, because even at the time you understood that was not the actual name of the band"
01:11:04;01:11:05;"Oh, for sure"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"Yeah, I think they'd already been coming out as just Bush for a bit"
01:11:08;01:11:09;"And then had to change it"
01:11:09;01:11:13;"Wait, so you can buy 16 Stone Canadian Edition and it says Bush X?"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"Yeah, it's got a little like, to the power of X"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"Whoa"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"And then they allowed them to drop it later"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"In '97, they reached an agreement"
01:11:22;01:11:27;"In which Bush was permitted to use the name Bush without X in exchange for donating 20K"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"To the Starlight Foundation"
01:11:30;01:11:34;"Which is a Canadian, oh, which is a charity"
01:11:34;01:11:35;"North American charity"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"They should have just gone by Bushes"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"That's right, yeah"
01:11:39;01:11:44;"I wonder when Bush was elected in 2000, if they were like, ""Aw, man"""
01:11:44;01:11:46;"That was kind of the beginning of the end for them"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Yeah, it's true"
01:11:47;01:11:51;"Right there in '95, Kate Bush was on sabbatical"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"There was no Bush in the White House"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"Perfect time for a band called Bush to come out"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Wide open lane"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Well, Jake, I think your prophecy's coming to pass"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Depending on how you look at it"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"The number five song in my year, 2002"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"""Our Good Friends"""
01:12:05;01:12:06;"Stained"
01:12:06;01:12:07;"Oh, hell yeah"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"With ""For You"""
01:12:08;01:12:11;"Released Christmas Day, 2001"
01:12:11;01:12:16;"Aw, harsher palette, harsher vibe"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"To my mother"
01:12:21;01:12:24;"To my father"
01:12:24;01:12:27;"It's your son or"
01:12:27;01:12:30;"It's your daughter"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"I might scream"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Loud enough for"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"This is some of the worst music ever recorded"
01:12:37;01:12:42;"I just, I hate this period of alternative rock"
01:12:42;01:12:43;"With a passion"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"Hey, man, this is my music"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"I was fully like"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"I don't know if I know this song"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"I would like put on the station"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"Hoping to hear Weezer or something"
01:12:51;01:12:52;"And it was like this"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"I would just be like"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"So, moving on"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Break the cycle"
01:12:58;01:13:01;"This album cost $800,000 to record"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"Which led Elektra Records to worry about"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Whether or not it would be successful"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"It was successful"
01:13:06;01:13:07;"Too big to fail"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"Ezra, how does a band, especially at this time"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"Spend $800,000?"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"You know, back then"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"They would probably just post up in an expensive studio"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"And just like, that really adds up"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"Just, yeah, like the day rate is like 10 grand or something"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Yeah, maybe the producer had a high fee"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"The mix, er, I don't know"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Flying around"
01:13:27;01:13:28;"You know"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"The whole band from Massachusetts to Los Angeles"
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Bottles of Patron"
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Yep"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"Elaborate sushi dinners"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"See, I don't know if I even really know this song"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"I don't know this song at all"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"I mean, if it was"
01:13:38;01:13:39;"It's been a while"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"We would actually be equal"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Yeah, I agree with that"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"I wish everything's in versus Stain, it's been a while"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"We couldn't get through that whole song"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Let's move on"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Alright, back to '95"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Jake's here"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Back to the good old days, huh?"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"The Stone Roses, that's kind of a surprise"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"Yeah, that is a surprise"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"With Love Spreads"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"I don't know if I know this one"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"You always get these funny surprises on the rock"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Modern rock charts"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"You get some weird UK"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"'Cause I could see how like for one week"
01:14:06;01:14:10;"Like, Radio took a chance on like a cool UK band"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"And then it just like slid off the charts"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Yeah"
01:14:13;01:14:17;"So this is the Stone Roses' like comeback album"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"Yeah, 'cause they had that big one in like"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"'89"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"Yeah, yeah"
01:14:22;01:14:25;"Stone Roses' lead guitarist John Squire wrote Love Spreads"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"Which challenged the conventional view of Jesus"
01:14:29;01:14:30;"It's just a real Christian episode"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"Yeah"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"In his lyrics, Squire portrayed the image of Jesus"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"As a black woman being crucified"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"Larry Norman, not happy"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Nope"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"Well, I expect, I actually respect the creativity"
01:14:41;01:14:51;"This is not so good"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"Yeah, I never fully"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"I need someone to really explain to me"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"The Stone Roses' trajectory"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"I could see how like"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"The fact that they're English makes me like this a little more"
01:15:01;01:15:04;"If this was just like a Black Crowes record from '95"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"We would just be like, turn it off"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"Yeah"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Get out of here"
01:15:07;01:15:10;"I guess picturing the Stone Roses get kind of like"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"Dang on it, like classic rock is kind of interesting"
01:15:12;01:15:18;"Once the vocals come in, it's tighter"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"Yeah, it's different now"
01:15:19;01:15:22;"'Cause yeah, the classic Stone Roses' song was I Wanna Be Adored"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"Right, and like way more indie"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Yeah"
01:15:25;01:15:32;"I'll tell you one thing about this song"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"Just to compare it to something else from the similar era"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"It's pretty good"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"I'm not mad at the classic rock reference"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"And forgive me Stone Roses fans"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"'Cause I really do like Stone Roses"
01:15:43;01:15:48;"But as far as throwback mid-'90s songs"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"This song wipes the floor with it"
01:15:50;01:15:58;"I hate progress, but fair enough"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Oh, listen, this song sounds good"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"For 1993, you kind of gotta get that for him"
01:16:05;01:16:11;"Like, it's pretty tasteful"
01:16:11;01:16:15;"To me, it's just so Hendrix, that riff"
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Yes"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"The other stuff is like more generic"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"Which, in a way, I respond to more"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"Like when you're just ripping off one guy"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"Yeah"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"This is straight off of Electric Lady Wayne"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"So you respect the Stone Roses' song more than this?"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"Yeah, kind of"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"It's like the specific era of Hendrix he's stealing from"
01:16:40;01:16:44;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"That's a sick part"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"You gotta give it up for that part"
01:16:49;01:16:53;"I'm so proud of the Rock Nohits"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"I just stole my way"
01:16:56;01:17:01;"I just stole my way"
01:17:01;01:17:04;"I'm really experienced"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"Green, greeny"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Alright, what about this?"
01:17:08;01:17:14;"Genius, love this, love this"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"You don't hate Kravitz"
01:17:16;01:17:17;"Best Kravitz song"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Okay"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"This song rules"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"I wish he had stayed in this mode"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"Yeah, he kind of never went back to it"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"He went so rock, which is just kind of..."
01:17:26;01:17:31;"What year is this?"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"I think this is like late 80s, this is earlier"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"'89, '90"
01:17:36;01:17:40;"That's sick"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"We are"
01:17:43;01:17:52;"So much time wasted"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"Playing games with love"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"I'm inside if Kravitz just went like full yacht rock"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Totally"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"Like this is kind of like a tasteful early 70s song"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"He just could have kept going deeper and deeper into..."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"Yeah, this is like some Seals and Croft or something"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Or like..."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"Jackson 5"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"Yeah, totally"
01:18:11;01:18:16;"Games we've tried to keep in love alive"
01:18:16;01:18:21;"But baby it ain't over 'til it's over"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"Alright, wait, what about..."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Love"
01:18:24;01:18:32;"Is gentle as a rose"
01:18:32;01:18:36;"I kind of respect that this is '89"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"Yeah"
01:18:38;01:18:44;"Can conquer anyone"
01:18:44;01:18:52;"It's time to take a stand"
01:18:52;01:18:57;"Brothers and sisters join in"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"We've got to let love rule"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"Let love rule"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Oh yeah"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"You respect it? This is tight"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Alright"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"Jake is a Kravitz fan"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Early work"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"No denying it"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"We've got to let love rule"
01:19:12;01:19:24;"Let love rule"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Okay"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"The number four song back in my year '02"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"Hoobasnack"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Oh, called it"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"I'm not even getting the best songs from these artists"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"I'm not even getting the reason"
01:19:38;01:19:45;"Did I ever tell the story on the show"
01:19:45;01:19:48;"That one time we played SNL"
01:19:48;01:19:51;"And the host was Zach Galifianakis"
01:19:51;01:19:52;"I'm a huge fan"
01:19:52;01:19:53;"Oh yeah, I think you did"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Legendary comedian"
01:19:54;01:19:55;"I think I... No, I told you"
01:19:55;01:19:56;"I can't remember if I told it on the show"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"But I'll tell it again"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"During the rehearsals"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"When they'd run the whole show"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"So he has to do the part"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Ladies and gentlemen, Vampire Weekend"
01:20:04;01:20:05;"He kept..."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"And he did it every single rehearsal"
01:20:06;01:20:10;"Go, ""Ladies and gentlemen, Hoobasnack"""
01:20:10;01:20:11;"And they don't stop"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"And they just cut to us"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"And we had to do it"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"So I really was kind of worried"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"He was going to do it"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Show day"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"He did not"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"He's a pro"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"Ladies and gentlemen, Hoobasnack"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"I've been handed"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"I've been crawling in the dark"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Looking for the answer"
01:20:33;01:20:36;"Help me carry on"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"Show me it's okay to"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"Use my heart and not my eyes"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"This is tough, but..."
01:20:42;01:20:45;"But you gotta give it up for..."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"This is such a funny era"
01:20:47;01:20:49;"Okay, but you gotta give it up for this"
01:20:50;01:20:55;"I'm not a perfect person"
01:20:55;01:20:59;"For as many things I wish I knew"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"Hell yeah, this is a solid song"
01:21:01;01:21:06;"But I continue learning"
01:21:06;01:21:10;"I'm not a perfect person"
01:21:10;01:21:15;"For as many things I wish I knew"
01:21:15;01:21:21;"But I continue learning"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"I never meant to do those things to you"
01:21:25;01:21:33;"So I have to say before I go"
01:21:33;01:21:38;"That I just want you to know"
01:21:38;01:21:44;"I found a reason for me"
01:21:44;01:21:50;"To change the way I see"
01:21:50;01:21:57;"A reason to start over new"
01:21:57;01:22:01;"And the reason is you"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"I feel like a lot of modern country dudes"
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Wish they had a power ballad this good"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"Oh, for sure"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"I mean, this would be so perfect for a modern country dude"
01:22:08;01:22:13;"There's something I must live with every day"
01:22:13;01:22:18;"I know the pain I put you through"
01:22:18;01:22:23;"I wish that I could take it all away"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"This is like a nice change here"
01:22:25;01:22:31;"I'm the one who catches all your tears"
01:22:31;01:22:36;"That's why I need you to hear"
01:22:36;01:22:42;"I found a reason for me"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"To change the way you do"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"It's like a weird, mute version of like"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"The Benz era radio ad"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"Yeah, it is pretty early radio ad"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"That like soaring, anthemic"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"Yeah"
01:22:55;01:23:00;"And the reason is you"
01:23:00;01:23:06;"And the reason is you"
01:23:12;01:23:17;"And the reason is you"
01:23:17;01:23:20;"What's the like reference that they're using"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"That Radiohead wouldn't use?"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Well, just the, I mean, the production is different"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"And the lyrics"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"Yeah, but like if Radiohead's making the Benz"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"And they're like"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"Well, this is also just like seven years later"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"So I think it's just like"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Everything sounds just like a little cleaner"
01:23:34;01:23:35;"More compressed"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"Auto-tune"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"Just like cheesier, more digital"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"And the guys in the band were like"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Presumably like, this sounds good"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Well, they're probably like"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"This sounds like fresh and like"
01:23:46;01:23:49;"Kind of like pop-oriented or something"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"I wonder if there was ever a moment where they were like"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"I don't know, is this too much?"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Is the auto-tune a little too obvious?"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"Is it a little too good?"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"Should we make it a little more"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Kind of warmer and 70s sounding?"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"They're never gonna do like, yeah"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"Very few people are doing that then"
01:24:02;01:24:03;"And I guess they were coming at it"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"From being this like, hard rock band"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"So, I don't know"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"They're just coming at it from a totally different angle"
01:24:09;01:24:14;"I found a reason to show"
01:24:14;01:24:20;"A side of me you didn't know"
01:24:20;01:24:27;"A reason for all that I do"
01:24:27;01:24:31;"And the reason is you"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Speaking of Radiohead the Benz"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"The bootleg t-shirt I saw online"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"And I sent to the thread"
01:24:39;01:24:41;"I've sent it to a lot of people"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"I debated if I should send it to Ed O'Brien"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"In front of the show"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"Because I don't know what the cultural difference is"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"In being British, if you would understand"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"But I'd like to describe it to the listeners"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"It's the cover of the Benz"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"Which you might recall is kind of like"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"A crash test dummy looking mannequin face"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"With its mouth open"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"You could either interpret that as"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"Being kind of in pain or in ecstasy"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"It's unsure"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"But where it says Radiohead"
01:25:07;01:25:11;"Somebody, a very smart, funny person"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"Changed the place where it said Radiohead"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"To say road [bleep]"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"And on first glance"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"The words are so similar"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"And if you don't know what road [bleep] is"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Then I'm going to assume you don't need to know"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"And then, instead of saying the Benz"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"It says the best"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"And there's just something about that"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"That mannequin face"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"It starts to look like a smile"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"It recontextualizes the face"
01:25:35;01:25:38;"And there's something so stupid about it to me"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"But this smiling dummy"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"And just, road [bleep] the best"
01:25:43;01:25:47;"Especially because Radiohead is very serious"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"They're so serious"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"So Radiohead, the Benz"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Turned into road [bleep] the best"
01:25:55;01:25:59;"Yeah, I mean, you always assume that the face on that cover is in pain"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"And it's called the Benz"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"And it's a Radiohead album, they're serious"
01:26:03;01:26:08;"It can only be agony that's being expressed on that cover"
01:26:08;01:26:11;"It never occurred to anyone that it was pleasure"
01:26:11;01:26:13;"And it completely flips it on its head"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"It's just like"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"The best, road [bleep]"
01:26:17;01:26:21;"You should send that to Ed O'Brien"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"If it wasn't Radiohead, it wouldn't"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"It's too deep"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"How do you set that up for Ed O'Brien so that he takes it in the spirit of"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"Yeah, we don't know each other quite well enough"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"He takes back, what's road [bleep]"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"I think you gotta preamble"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Like, hey Ed, you know, just so you know"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"You gotta explain it before you send it"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Cheers mate, what the [bleep] is this?"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"Send to Tom?"
01:26:41;01:26:45;"Please forward to Tom"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"I mean, I send it to a lot of just random people"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"I know"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"A lot of people, I just send it to them"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Would you wear this?"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Oh, the classic, would you wear?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"I think we need to get this shirt"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"And Jake"
01:26:59;01:27:01;"Needs to wear it to his local coffee shop"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"Absolutely, there's no world where I'm wearing that shirt"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Here's the thing, it's not even that aggressive"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Because"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Most people will look at it"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"And really just think you're wearing a Radiohead, The Benz shirt"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Because road [bleep] and Radiohead look so similar"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"When they're written out in the same font"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"It's just gonna be some"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"The person who's gonna notice is some 23 year old woman"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Who's just at her laptop"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Sitting at the thing that's like, looking at it for"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Usually three, four times"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"And then finally she's like"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"What the [bleep]"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Oh, I love that album"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"You know what you do, you send it to Liam Gallagher"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"You say, you know"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"You test the humor over there"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"You say, would Tom like this?"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"Liam, I know you're not a fan of Radiohead"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"But what do you think about"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"Those car school ads"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Oh man"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"There's nobody quite right to send it to"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Other than the Crisis crew and a few"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Of my kooky friends, cause"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"If somebody's a hardcore Radiohead fan, they'll just be like"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"It's not funny"
01:27:57;01:28:01;"How dare you"
01:28:01;01:28:05;"That's a problem with like a certain type of meme"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And probably why"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Our culture is doomed, is that there's certain memes"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"That you find so funny"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"And yet as opposed to"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Other more traditional forms of humor"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"It's like very difficult to share"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"I don't know if you guys ever have this"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"That you're hanging out"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"And you just kind of laugh to yourself and somebody says"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"What's so funny? And you know, I picture"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"If that happened in the 70s, you'd probably just be like"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"Alright, well I was just thinking about it last night"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Me and Bradley were out at the bar"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"And you would like have a story"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Where it's like, alright, what's so funny"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"It just literally"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Happens to me all the time, I'm just like sitting"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"In the kitchen, just like laughing"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"Like kind of laughing to myself, and she's like, what's so funny"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"It's gonna take 40 minutes to explain"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"Like, do you know the Radiohead album"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"The Bends? No"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Uh, I think, I think so"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"Can you picture the cover? No"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"Okay, this is the cover, really take it in"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Alright, hold on a second, let me find"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"Okay, now look at this"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"It says road a**"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"The bed, yeah, having to explain it"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"You're like, uh"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"You gotta explain the joke"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Okay, back to the number"
01:29:09;01:29:11;"Three song Jake's here, oh look at that"
01:29:11;01:29:13;"Oasis, Live Forever"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Oh yeah"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"This was their first hit I think"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"Yeah, I think this is the first Oasis"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Song that I had heard, released in"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"August of '94"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"Wow, so this really had legs"
01:29:25;01:29:37;"'95, Mopping the Floor"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"2002"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"In a funny way I feel more connected to the"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"This music, the '95 music than"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"2002"
01:29:45;01:30:01;"Now Live Forever was written by Noel"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"In 1991"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"I'm looking for a roadie for the"
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Inspiral Carpets"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"Oh yeah, Inspiral Carpets"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Manchester, man"
01:30:15;01:30:23;"When bands have songs"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"I mean, this was their first record"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"Right"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"That they were pulling from songs"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"That went back years"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Well that's like what people always say"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"You have your whole life to make your first album"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"And you have one year to make your second"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Right"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"Although they knocked it out of the park with their second"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Far and away their biggest record"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"I wonder how many of those songs in the second record"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"Were already written before the first record"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"I say you and I are gonna live forever"
01:30:49;01:31:07;"I like Oasis more now than I did then"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"I didn't like them then"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"I didn't like it was so"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Referential to classic rock"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Right"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"These guys are just goofy"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Yeah and you're a bit older"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"I liked Champagne Supernova and"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"Wonderwall"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"They were just so ubiquitous"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"But I truly loved"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Don't Look Back in Anger"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"I could see being like"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"Seven years older"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Because you'd been in college by then"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"But did you like Don't Look Back in Anger?"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"I did, because that song is so"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"Unimpeachable"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"I remember hearing that"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"It was on the radio"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"And I was listening to the alternative rock station"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Yeah"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"But I didn't know who it was"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"And it's also Noel singing it"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"So it doesn't have that characteristic Liam"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Kind of sneer"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"And I was like are they playing like a"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"Weird George Harrison song that I've never heard before"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Like"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"I had this weird like moment of dislocation"
01:32:05;01:32:11;"But this is so referential too"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"I know"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"I mean as Noel famously said"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Imagine"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"How come when I do it it's a rip off"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"When Radiohead does it it's pastiche"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"It's an homage"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Oh yeah"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"Maybe he said yeah"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"When I do it it's a rip off"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"When Radiohead does it it's an homage"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"I remember getting hip to that when I was like"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Getting serious about art and I'd like go to"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Exhibitions and like read the press releases"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"And I'd be looking at someone's work that was like"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Completely derivative of"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"Someone very specific"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"But they would frame it as an homage"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Yeah and I'd be like oh"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"They're looking to this artist from the 70s"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"Or they're doing an homage to this artist from the 70s"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"I'd be like okay"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"I see how this"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"They're cooking the books here"
01:32:57;01:33:01;"I stand up beside the fireplace"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Take that look from off your face"
01:33:03;01:33:11;"You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out"
01:33:11;01:33:19;"So Sally come wait"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"I think the interview that I'm referencing he did in like"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"99, 2000 so"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"He's thinking about this song being called a"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"John Lennon rip off"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"And then Karma Police from two years later"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"Which very explicitly references"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Sexy Sadie"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"Being homage"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Oh yeah that's totally sexy Sadie"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Dang dang dang dang dang"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Okay I mean the feeling of"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Karma Police is so different"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"This is the feeling"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Of like Let It Be era"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Beatles"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Like I was saying like that experience"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Of hearing it for the first time"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"And knowing what it was"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"And I was literally like"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Is this like an outtake?"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"But great song"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"Please don't put your life in the hands"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Of a rock and roll band"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"We'll throw it all away"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed"
01:38:13;01:38:17;"There's like a seething rage underneath"
01:38:17;01:38:21;"but your outward presentation is sort of like sensitive art bro"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Right. Yeah, I think"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"It's a fun hang"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"Definitely"
01:38:27;01:38:30;"I know the type. And I think there's a bit of a horseshoe theory too"
01:38:30;01:38:34;"where sometimes there is a place where actually the truly the most humble"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"like actually zenned out person"
01:38:36;01:38:40;"and the most arrogant but with a sly smile person"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"are kind of similar"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"because they're both taking the p***"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"they're both honking because they're in on the cosmic joke"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"(laughter)"
01:38:48;01:38:52;"You gotta watch out for those fake betas in the middle"
01:38:52;01:38:55;"Number three song, my year 2002"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Puddle of Mud"
01:38:57;01:38:59;"Wait, this is so crazy"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"This is just a great"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"This is interesting, Jake's had so far all English"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"Bush, Stone Roses, Oasis"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"and I've had all American"
01:39:08;01:39:11;"stained, hoobastank, puddle of mud"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"(laughter)"
01:39:13;01:39:17;"Nice acoustic harmonics"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Kind of interesting"
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Feeling that"
01:39:21;01:39:25;"I hate the drummers in these bands"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Well, do you hate the drummers or the drum sound?"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"I think the drumming too"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"They like quantize it, right?"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"So it's perfectly rhythmic even though it's like"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"I think so"
01:39:35;01:39:38;"Yeah, I mean, they were getting pretty granular in this era"
01:39:41;01:39:46;"Yeah, the drumming just strikes me as incredibly"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"like technical and like"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"penal, no feel"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"I think they run it through a program"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"Mathematically correct but zero vibe"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"I think a lot of these drummers probably came from"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"like really technical metal"
01:40:03;01:40:13;"Oh, this song is about his desire"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"to be a good dad to his son"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"I wonder why it's called ""Words"""
01:40:55;01:40:59;"I just remind me of his first"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"""Every little thing"""
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Kind of reminds me of the police or something in a weird way"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"(laughs)"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"I can totally hear that"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Like the verse of ""Every little thing she does is magic"""
01:41:09;01:41:11;"Yeah"
01:41:57;01:42:07;"Oh, jig number two"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"""Mortal Jam Better Man"""
01:42:09;01:42:11;"Not my favorite PJ song"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"but I'll take it"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"This is how ""Better Man"" starts?"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"Wow, Eddie Vedder wrote ""Better Man"""
01:42:25;01:42:27;"while in high school"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Right, I knew that. I think we talked about it on the show"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Oh yeah"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"And he based it off of ""Save It for Later"" English beat"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"Oh right, right, we did touch on that"
01:42:35;01:42:37;"And again, a guy having a song"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"Right"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"Sitting around for 10 years"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"He says he recorded on a 4-track"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"I wonder if he ever released the demo"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"I would love to hear those"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"4-track tapes from Vedder"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Another like 10, 15 years"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"Yeah"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"Sometimes I think about how far I've come as a teenager"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Sitting on the bed in San Diego"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"writing ""Better Man"" wondering"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"if anyone would ever hear it"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"I always liked hearing this song on"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"alt-rock radio and"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"back in the day"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"It just felt kind of like different"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Better Man demo"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"A lot of Taylor Swift comes up because she has a song called"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"""Better Man"" or maybe she covered"
01:43:37;01:43:39;"this song, who knows"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"Brendan O'Brien, the producer said"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"One of the first rehearsals we did"
01:43:53;01:43:55;"They played it and I said ""Man, that song's a hit!"""
01:43:55;01:43:57;"And Eddie just went ""Uhhh"""
01:43:57;01:43:59;"And I immediately knew I just"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"said the wrong thing"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"We cut it once for verses"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"He wanted to give it away to this Greenpeace"
01:44:05;01:44:07;"benefit record"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"The idea was that the band was going to play and some other"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"singer was going to sing it"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"I remember saying to the engineer, Nick"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"This is one of their best songs"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"and they're just going to give it away? Can't happen"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Wow"
01:44:27;01:44:39;"This song has a lightness about it. Yeah. I mean it makes sense he wrote this in high"
01:44:39;01:44:45;"school it's so simple it has that feel."
01:44:45;01:44:49;"She dreams in colors she dreams in red."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"Can't find a better man."
01:45:01;01:45:13;"She loves to hang out."
01:45:13;01:45:17;"She don't want to leave this way."
01:45:17;01:45:21;"She feeds hell."
01:45:21;01:45:25;"That's why she'll be back again."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"Wow the hits keep coming in 2002."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Man, Ezra."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Yeah."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"P.O.D."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Youth of a Nation?"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"Youth of a Nation."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Okay, you know what, this song's actually pretty good."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"I like P.O.D."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"Yeah."
01:45:38;01:45:39;"Alright, number two."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"2002 P.O.D."
01:45:41;01:45:46;"This is probably the best song so far."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"P.O.D. at heart."
01:45:49;01:45:53;"Do they have any other like big songs beyond this?"
01:45:53;01:45:58;"Uh, didn't they have one that went tick tick boom?"
01:46:08;01:46:14;"Oh, Dark. This was inspired by mass shootings at Santana High School in Columbine."
01:46:14;01:46:18;"Evergreen, Sookmetter, Darapueta."
01:46:18;01:46:30;"I don't think I know this song."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"I don't know."
01:46:34;01:46:49;"It's kind of a Linkin Park, very Linkin Park."
01:46:49;01:46:53;"Very Alien Ant Park."
01:46:59;01:47:02;"You guys remember Alien Ant Park, Smooth Criminal?"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Oh yeah."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"That was great."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Massive."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"This is not my favorite P.O.D. song."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"Do you know that Skid Row song, Youth Gone Wild?"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"Oh yeah."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"No, I don't know."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"We are the Youth Gone Wild."
01:47:14;01:47:21;"One of my first concerts I ever went to alone was the G&R Skid Row at the Cap Center."
01:47:21;01:47:23;"What year?"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"I love it."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Well, not alone alone, you know that."
01:47:27;01:47:31;"10 years old going alone."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"Oh wait, they'll set a song called Alive."
01:47:33;01:47:41;"P.O.D.'s got a bit more life than some of what we've heard so far."
01:47:41;01:47:52;"Is this not before Linkin Park?"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Linkin Park."
01:47:54;01:48:02;"1991 was the G&R Skid Row tour."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Oh wow."
01:48:03;01:48:05;"That would have been 12."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"You went with some friends?"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"Just Adam Goldstein."
01:48:08;01:48:11;"Dr. Alan Goldstein dropped us off."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Wow."
01:48:12;01:48:13;"So that's..."
01:48:13;01:48:14;"Just the two of you guys, 12."
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Oh yeah."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"First time out."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"That's a good one too."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"With my son."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"At 12?"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"Maybe."
01:48:21;01:48:22;"With a buddy?"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Maybe."
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Times are different."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"Yeah."
01:48:25;01:48:27;"Linkin Park's first album, 2000."
01:48:27;01:48:28;"Okay."
01:48:28;01:48:31;"Hybrid Theory with In The End."
01:48:31;01:48:38;"Well, we all knew that 1995 was going to be a bit stronger than 2002, at least based on the sensibility of the TCU."
01:48:38;01:48:43;"Jake coming in with a Stone Cold classic at number one, Green Day, When I Come Around."
01:48:43;01:48:46;"Probably one of my favorite Green Day songs."
01:48:46;01:48:47;"This one."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"The Green Day."
01:48:49;01:48:50;"I like it."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Songwriters, all three guys."
01:48:51;01:48:53;"Billy Joe, Mike, Trey."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"Love to see it."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"Mike really brings it on this song."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"[mimics guitar]"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"Yeah."
01:48:59;01:49:13;"Mike and Trey came up the other day in conversation."
01:49:13;01:49:16;"I dropped my guitar off at Uniform Music."
01:49:16;01:49:17;"Oh."
01:49:17;01:49:22;"Nice little shop in Eagle Rock run by Eric who works on some of Ezra's stuff."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"But I have this '70s Gibson guitar."
01:49:25;01:49:30;"And this guy Eric, he knows every model of every instrument."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Yeah, yeah."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"He's epic."
01:49:32;01:49:37;"And then he was like, ""Actually, in the mid-'70s, Gibson was making great bass."""
01:49:37;01:49:41;"Actually, Mike Dyrnt, Green Day, plays mid-'70s Gibson bass."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Oh, really?"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"I was like, ""Dude."""
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Did he play it on When I Come Around?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Probably."
01:49:47;01:50:06;"What's he saying?"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"""Sold donuts at my door?"""
01:50:08;01:50:11;"Oh, ""Don't knock down my door."""
01:50:13;01:50:16;"""Sold donuts at my door."""
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Door to door donuts."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"Make sure you do it right"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"You may find out that yourself"
01:50:27;01:50:30;"Don't means nothing when it's hard to live"
01:50:30;01:50:35;"You can't go forcing something if it's just not right"
01:50:35;01:50:40;"No time to search the world around"
01:50:40;01:50:44;"'Cause you know where I'll be found"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"When I come around"
01:50:48;01:51:09;"No time to search the world around"
01:51:09;01:51:13;"'Cause you know where I'll be found"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"When I come around"
01:51:16;01:51:21;"When I come around"
01:51:31;01:51:34;"Great song."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"Yeah."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"From a beautiful album."
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Okay."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"Well..."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"TC Cannon."
01:51:39;01:51:44;"The number one song the week I turned 18 in 2002."
01:51:44;01:51:48;"Well, this one I could say I share a bit more of a sensibility with..."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Yeah."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"...than the rest."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Jim Meat World, the middle."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"I remember I was like the solo on this song and..."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"And weirdly, I think there's a connection."
01:51:57;01:52:02;"I think Ariel Rekshide, part of the Vampire Weekend family..."
01:52:02;01:52:06;"I'm pretty sure I was at his house and he had like a platinum..."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"...plaque for this album."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"And I was like, ""Wait, what'd you do on that album?"""
01:52:11;01:52:12;"And let me look."
01:52:12;01:52:14;"In 2001?"
01:52:14;01:52:16;"You gotta remember, Ariel had his band, The Hippos,"
01:52:16;01:52:20;"the pop-punk band in the late '90s, so he would've probably..."
01:52:20;01:52:22;"And this was Jim Meat World's fourth album,"
01:52:22;01:52:25;"so probably they would've been crossing paths."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"Ariel did additional vocals on track seven,"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"which is If You Don't, Don't."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"Background vocalist."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"Wow."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"Jim Meat World, the middle."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Huge song."
01:52:47;01:52:54;"What did you think of the song when it came out, Jake?"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"I liked it. I still like it."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"I mean, it's corny as hell, but I dig it."
01:52:59;01:53:02;"I mean, you know me, I like pop."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"Right. I bet Matt loves it."
01:53:04;01:53:05;"Yeah."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"This is a good song."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"Yeah."
01:53:08;01:53:12;"Yeah, this is a great song."
01:53:12;01:53:15;"It's also the only one on the--"
01:53:15;01:53:18;"It's really the only one from this top five"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"that breaks the sound at all."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"I mean, everything else is--"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"You need a 4-all in that very specific genre."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Like, so dialed in."
01:53:31;01:53:50;"I never knew what he was saying there."
01:53:50;01:53:54;"He's saying, ""Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride."""
01:53:54;01:53:57;"""Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride."""
01:53:57;01:54:00;"I thought he said, ""Little bit of in the middle."""
01:54:00;01:54:03;"Oh, so this whole song is addressed to a little girl."
01:54:34;01:54:40;"I think Owl City was probably inspired by that part."
01:54:42;01:54:49;"I feel like Jimmy World has a lot of good songs."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"This is their one--"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"Like, heads who are into that kind of music"
01:54:53;01:54:56;"are always Jimmy World rules."
01:54:56;01:55:00;"This is far and away their biggest crossover hit."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Wait, what's this?"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"This is on the same album?"
01:55:06;01:55:23;"Are they from SoCal? Where are they from?"
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Arizona."
01:55:24;01:55:28;"Arizona? Interesting. Arizona pop punk."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"Like Phoenix?"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"Arizona pop punk tradition."
01:55:32;01:55:36;"Nate Roos, the singer from Fun,"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"he started using an Arizona pop punk band."
01:55:38;01:55:41;"Started out, probably knew these guys."
01:56:19;01:56:29;"Well, at least we ended on a high note."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"Definitely."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Or at least a middle note."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"No, a high note."
01:56:34;01:56:36;"I'm just saying that because the song's called ""The Middle."""
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Anyway."
01:56:38;01:56:39;"I followed you."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Alright, thanks."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"I got it."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Just wanted to make sure there's not some diehard Jimmy World fans--"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"Feeling slighted?"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"No, that's a great song."
01:56:47;01:56:50;"As predicted, '95, a bit stronger than 2002,"
01:56:50;01:56:53;"but maybe in a few years we'll listen back to these things"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"and 2002 will start to sound better and better."
01:56:55;01:56:58;"It's missing seven years of seasoning."
01:56:58;01:57:02;"I think my opinion of that era of music has calcified."
01:57:02;01:57:04;"It's not going to change."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Like it's carved into stone."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"Well, maybe when your daughter's a bit older and she's just like,"
01:57:08;01:57:12;"""Dad, I can't believe you missed out, man!"""
01:57:12;01:57:15;"You thought you were listening to--"
01:57:15;01:57:16;"It's been 20 years."
01:57:16;01:57:17;"It's 20 years old."
01:57:17;01:57:19;"So it's due for a comeback."
01:57:19;01:57:23;"I was going to say it's sort of had its time to sort of age."
01:57:23;01:57:25;"Yeah, it's kind of percolated at this point."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"I think so."
01:57:26;01:57:29;"I like the idea of Lizzie being like, ""Wait a second."
01:57:29;01:57:34;"P.O.D. was touring when you were like fresh out of college"
01:57:34;01:57:37;"and you missed them?"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"You telling me--"""
01:57:38;01:57:40;"She's like bringing up--"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"Who was playing in Portland, Oregon?"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"And you didn't go."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"In November of 2002, you missed it."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"What were you doing then, Dad?"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"Delivering pizza for Papa John's."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"Maybe seeing Bill to Spill or something."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Oh, my God."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Who?"
01:57:56;01:58:00;"The Korean boy band?"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"♪ Are you listening? ♪"
01:58:02;01:58:05;"♪ Oh ♪"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"Yeah, that was a weird time."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"Anyway, that was fun."
01:58:09;01:58:13;"We should keep digging into various points in our lives."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"How about the Modern Rock charts?"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"We were each 30."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"Interesting."
01:58:17;01:58:18;"Oh, seven?"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"You're oh, seven."
01:58:20;01:58:21;"Not that different."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"For me, 15."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"I guess things were starting to change then."
01:58:24;01:58:25;"All right."
01:58:25;01:58:28;"Another semi-banked TC."
01:58:28;01:58:30;"We'll see you guys real soon."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"Thanks for listening."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"Peace."
01:58:33;01:58:37;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
