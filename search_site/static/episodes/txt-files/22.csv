00:00;00:17;"Time Crisis, Summer 2016. Raw. This is a summer episode. We're gonna go back to 2006, '96 and '86 to discover what those summers were like."
00:17;00:26;"We're gonna talk to Mike D from the Beastie Boys. We're gonna eat Cool Ranch Doritos. And of course, we're gonna count down the top five."
00:26;00:36;"This is the Summer of Time Crisis with Ezra Kaydin. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Squad 1."
00:36;00:49;"They passed me by, all of those great romances The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:49;01:08;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:26;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying Time Crisis, we're back. Two weeks ago we did a 4th of July special where we went through all 50 states. That went down pretty well. But now we're back, it's just a regular old show. Back here in LA. What's up, Jake?"
01:26;01:34;"Not much, man. New digs. Yeah, we're at this new studio in Culver City. It's a lot fancier than the room we used to work in."
01:34;01:47;"The last room we worked in, there was just like a college dorm microfridge and a couple folding tables. Yeah, this room has, what do you think, 14 foot high ceilings?"
01:47;01:57;"Pretty good guess, I might even say 16. Wow. Alright, 16 foot high ceilings, a lot more like Apple branded panels and light boxes."
01:57;02:10;"Jake, you made the very astute comment you brought a long sleeve shirt because you quote unquote knew the AC would be jacked. It's true, it's cold in here."
02:10;02:16;"Yeah, what is that? The more corporate a place is, the more jacked the AC is. Yeah, I think that's true."
02:16;02:28;"I feel like independent movie theaters, it's gonna be maybe in the low 70s. I would say high 70s. In the high 70s. And then a big corporate chain like an AMC, it's gonna be 65."
02:28;02:38;"You're set like a 2pm screening of Independence Day Resurgence, whatever it's called. And it's just like, 67 degrees in there. It's wild."
02:38;02:53;"What do you keep it at your house? 75 or 78. Honestly, I'm not an AC guy. If we have it like 71, 72, it feels cold. And if it's 90 out and you walk into your house and it's 78, that feels great."
02:53;03:08;"Like 78 with ceiling fans, you're golden. Yeah, and I can't remember what I keep it at in LA. In New York, I just have like a window. You say 70 on the, you don't know what the temperature actually is."
03:08;03:16;"The place I'm living in now is the first place I've had or lived in that had AC. Really? Yeah. You just lived without AC? Yeah."
03:16;03:27;"So it would just be like 100 degrees outside and what were you doing? Fans, you know. Wet paper towel on the back of your neck? Yeah, being hot, hanging out shirtless."
03:27;03:41;"You know what's interesting? In a lot of Europe, they don't really have AC. So like Germany, which is a, by most people's standards, a very evolved country in terms of like quality of life or whatever."
03:41;03:52;"People eat well, exercise, blah, blah, blah. There's no, even at like rich people's houses, it's just hot. Huh. It just like opened the windows. Old school. Yeah."
03:52;03:58;"I wonder about like at like offices and corporate and government buildings and whatnot. Yeah, it's probably a little more jacked."
04:49;05:07;"Crazy couple weeks. Where have you been? I haven't seen you. Oh yeah, I've been all over the place. I was in New York, in France, Italy. How was? It was all fine."
05:07;05:21;"Europe? Yeah, Europe's all right. I definitely, I, you know, of course all countries are great in their own way. I tend to have a better time in Italy than in France. Maybe it's just because I'm a real Italian food aficionado."
05:21;05:32;"I feel that. Pasta just tastes so good, man. One thing I'll tell you that I got was difficult for me though is the two hour Italian lunch phenomenon. Wow."
05:32;05:48;"It's like a beautiful thing. I think it's great that people like sit down with their families more than in America. People take off work, go home, eat. But I get really like, maybe just because I'm such like a dip at American, you know, everything all the time."
05:48;06:02;"I just need it fast that, you know, because I've always been the type of dude just like, you know, grab like the cold cuts out of the fridge, eat it over the garbage can. That's lunch. Yeah. You know, and go, go, go, go, go, go."
06:02;06:18;"Gotta keep moving. Puritan work ethic. Yeah, I guess. Hypercapitalist. Yeah. Nonstop infinite growth. But so in Italy, people sit down with and have like kind of coursed out meals and sit and talk with the family."
06:18;06:32;"It's nice, but then I'd really, I feel like this physical sensation after I lunch, which is like, I just got to like move or lie down. Yeah. I just can't keep sitting at the table. And then it's a little bit like, Oh, who wants an espresso? And then like bring up the espresso."
06:32;06:46;"And then you just like chilling and chatting. And it almost made me feel like a child again. Just like, may I be excused? But you know, maybe it's like, I got to just work on my, um, my attention deficit disorder, I guess."
06:46;07:01;"I mean, the funny thing is I can't imagine you had things that were pressing that you had to get to while you're in Italy on vacation. No, of course not. I got to get to this email. Like what? No, no, but you know, it's funny. It's like life puts those feelings into you and it's hard to unwind."
07:01;07:23;"So it's like, yeah, of course you're out there in Italy, just chilling. There's nothing you have to get to, but then your body responds as if you have something to get to. Stress is a choice. Fight or flight. Adrenaline. Were you drinking at lunch? Like red wine? Often. Wow. Yeah. That would put me to sleep. Pasta and red wine at like 1230."
07:23;07:48;"One. And then you have the espresso. Okay. So that kind of levels you off. And then maybe a siesta. Wow. Also, I think, I don't know if this is true or not, but I think Italian people know how to not go crazy with the pasta. But again, coming from my American hyper-capitalist, all about me greed."
07:48;08:09;"Old spaghetti factory. I just can't. Yeah. I don't know. You know, Italian people I think are in better health and shape than Americans. Although some people, Michael Moore would say it's because of their six weeks of paid vacation versus our zero. That might have something to do with it."
08:09;08:36;"But also I just feel like when there's a big, beautiful bowl of pasta on the table, I could truly have infinite servings of it. I have no impulse control. Whereas like some Italian people have like a little bowl of pasta and then onto this, whatever. Right. How do they do that? Or like my favorite, like the classic, like Italian restaurant in America vibe. That's like giant chicken parm already like just coated in like bread crumbs already full of carbohydrates."
08:36;08:55;"And then for your side, a bowl of pasta. That always mystified me. Like the plain bowl of pasta that you have to put the red sauce on. I love Italian food so much. Chicken parm. Chicken parm. I love Italian American food, but of course, Italy does have a unique food culture."
08:55;09:12;"We have to go to Colombo sometime. Where's that? It's an Eagle Rock. It's near my house. It's like old school Italian restaurant? It's like 1980 North Jersey Italian restaurant. Oh really? Yeah. Well that's much. Live jazz. Oh really? Yeah. Italian food and jazz. Two of my greatest pleasures in life."
09:12;09:19;"You're listening to Time Crisis on B1."
10:17;10:36;"So anyway, now we're in the thick of summer. So this is going to be a real summer show. So for all our listeners at home, we're going to be talking a lot about the songs of the summer. We're going to be digging into the mists of time to tell you what songs were big in various other summers. We're going back 10, 20, 30 years."
10:36;10:56;"We're also going to be chatting a little bit with Mike D of Beastie Boys fame, who also just started his show Echo Chamber on Apple Music. And of course, the top five songs on iTunes. Cross reference of the top five songs of 1968. Another tense year in America."
10:56;11:19;"All right, man. So it's summer. Yeah, man. We've already been talking a little bit on this show about the songs of the summer. It's summer 2016. This is shaping up to be a memorable summer, to say the least. Tumultuous. I mean, I think the summer before an election is always going to be a little crazy. Yeah, Trump's running around. I mean, it's pretty wild."
11:19;11:37;"So before we get into 2016, I think it's worth looking back at years past to help contextualize what's going on. So 10 years ago, we're going to work our way back in 10 year segments. Cool. And we're going to look at some of the big songs of various summers. So let's go back 10 years ago, 2006."
11:37;12:00;"So first of all, let's try to paint a picture because we probably got some listeners who were either very young in 2006 or maybe they were abroad with no Internet. So they might not remember what was going on 2006. So in my life, 2006, that was actually the first summer I graduated. I was out of school because I graduated college in 2006."
12:00;12:17;"So Vampire Weekend was just getting started, making some demos. I remember I had to do my teacher training for my upcoming job as a teacher. So that was kind of brutal. I was out in Queens. Was that like a full time training thing? Monday through Friday? For like a few weeks it was."
12:17;12:33;"Yes, I just have like vague memories of summer 2006. I was like learning how to be a teacher, chilling in New York. Where'd you live in New York? Bed-Stuy? That house? I was about to move into Bed-Stuy. I remember my girlfriend at the time, Sarah. You remember Sarah? Yeah, sure. Shout out to Sarah."
12:33;12:53;"She was still in college, so it's that classic, like, you know, she was like probably 21, ending up in some weird summer sublet situation. So she had a sublet, which was this eccentric Italian woman in Hell's Kitchen who had a massive loft that was full of like architecture books and stuff. Maybe she was an architect."
12:53;13:09;"And she divided the apartment up into various rooms made out of bookshelves. So if you entered the apartment in the middle of the night, she'd be sleeping, so you'd be very quiet. And then you go into one of three or four little like rental rooms."
13:09;13:37;"So I remember there was like this Spanish dude. It was actually very international. There was like this French dude who was like playing video games and like cursing in French all night. So I'd be like kind of like sleeping with my girlfriend in this funny little bed, hearing everything in this apartment. Wow. Very New York. Very New York. Yeah, classic, just like overcrowded, expensive New York people living in kind of bizarre ways. Although I look back on it fondly. But yeah, so I was basically hanging out a lot in Hell's Kitchen, learning how to be a teacher. What were you doing in 2006?"
13:37;14:05;"Living in San Francisco, delivering groceries, playing music. But I also remember '06, I did a drive across the country with my buddy Steve Schrader, and we were photographing big box stores and franchise corporate architecture. So we would like be driving in Ohio, we'd see a Home Depot, pull over, photograph the Home Depot, keep driving. It was a fun trip. We drove from the East Coast all the way to Portland, Oregon. Wow. Took about a week."
14:05;14:09;"You must have learned a lot about America. Yeah, got a lot of great images."
14:09;14:31;"So while you were rolling across the country, you might have remembered some of these songs popping on the radio. So let's get into the top five songs of summer 2006. So we're going to start with this one. Actually, this is Young Jock. It's going down. Do I remember this? It's going down. Okay, I think I remember this song."
14:31;14:33;"Young Jock?"
14:33;14:45;"Young Jock. Y-U-N-G-J-O-C."
14:45;14:57;"Long intro."
14:57;15:03;"It's modern in a way. Yeah, if you told me this was brand new, I'd be like, okay. I believe you."
15:03;15:15;"I mean, this is like the kind of stuff before trap music had truly crossed over into pop music. This stuff had like similar tempo."
15:15;15:21;"It's like a one minor chord jam."
15:21;15:24;"Back then, it would often be snaps."
15:24;15:29;"I like that."
15:29;15:34;"This is pretty unexceptional. I think I would... Hold on, you haven't heard the chorus yet."
15:34;15:56;"It's going down."
15:56;16:25;"It's going down."
16:25;16:33;"It's going down."
16:33;16:39;"Alright, this makes me think of something. So, Jake, do you know what the trap is?"
16:39;16:44;"No. When you were like, trap music crossed over, I was like, what is that?"
16:44;16:57;"I'm far from an expert, but the trap refers to drug dealing. So the trap would be like a location involved in drug dealing. And I can only speak as a suburban white person."
16:57;17:09;"But it's interesting because I think when this song came out in 2006, when Young Jock was saying, ""You can find me in the trap,"" the vast majority of white people hearing that on the radio were not familiar with the word trap."
17:09;17:13;"I think I would have thought of some nautical themed bar or something."
17:13;17:14;"The trap?"
17:14;17:16;"Yeah, like, ""Meet me at the trap."""
17:16;17:20;"Right. So anyway, congratulations on the word trap."
17:20;17:22;"I wonder what that guy's doing now."
17:22;17:23;"Young Jock?"
17:23;17:24;"Is he still doing it?"
17:24;17:26;"I don't think he's had a top five hit in a while."
17:26;17:27;"Yeah."
17:27;17:32;"But he's doing his thing. The next song from summer 2006 was by Cassie. Remember Cassie?"
17:32;17:33;"Oh, I remember this."
17:33;17:35;"Yeah, and she was dating Diddy for a while."
17:35;17:36;"I think she's from Connecticut."
17:36;17:39;"Really? Connecticut's own Cassie."
17:39;17:46;"This was on the radio a ton. I remember him being so into this song."
17:46;17:56;"This song sounds very modern, too."
17:56;18:03;"Has production changed a ton in the last ten years?"
18:03;18:06;"In some ways."
18:06;18:07;"I mean..."
18:07;18:09;"I know that's a real general question, but..."
18:09;18:14;"I mean, that... that orc stab?"
18:14;18:15;"Yeah."
18:15;18:19;"Sounds a little... places this to me in a different era."
18:19;18:24;"Also, vocal sound has changed a lot."
18:24;18:26;"Yeah, that's true."
18:26;18:32;"This is a pretty straightforward dry vocal."
18:33;18:38;"If this song hadn't been a hit song, and somebody just gave us the session,"
18:38;18:41;"we could make a few small changes and get it on the radio today."
18:41;18:42;"Right."
18:43;18:48;"I know that my guys, they've been talking about the way I talk."
19:08;19:13;"I know that my guys, they've been talking about the way I do."
19:13;19:14;"I do."
19:14;19:16;"They heard I was good."
19:16;19:19;"They wanna see if it's true."
19:19;19:23;"They know you're the one I wanna give it to."
19:23;19:26;"I can see you want me too."
19:26;19:28;"And now it's me and me."
19:28;19:32;"Now, I've been waiting for you."
19:32;19:35;"I'm thinking 'bout making love."
19:35;19:38;"Tell me if you like it, tell me if you need it."
19:38;19:44;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
19:44;19:46;"Great song."
19:46;19:48;"Connecticut's own Cassie with me and you."
19:48;19:51;"I remember Steve telling me that song was about oral."
19:51;19:52;"Excuse me?"
19:52;19:53;"Giving oral."
19:53;19:56;"You know, all songs are about oral."
19:56;19:57;"No."
19:57;19:58;"All songs."
19:58;20:03;"They say that before the post-war American boom--"
20:03;20:05;"Well, there's two great traditions of music, right?"
20:05;20:06;"There's--"
20:06;20:08;"Here we go."
20:08;20:10;"There's-- you know, 'cause back in the day,"
20:10;20:14;"music was very much controlled, at least in Europe, by the church."
20:14;20:19;"So music-- there's the two great traditions of music are religious and secular."
20:19;20:23;"And secular music's really exploded in the era of mass media."
20:23;20:26;"But before that, the most famous music was church music."
20:26;20:29;"And so people sometimes say the only difference between church music and secular music"
20:29;20:31;"is who you're talking about."
20:31;20:33;"'Cause in church music, you're talking about God."
20:33;20:36;"So you could say in secular music, you're talking about sex."
20:36;20:37;"I guess so."
20:37;20:39;"You could have a church song called ""Me and You."""
20:39;20:40;"Yeah."
20:40;20:43;"Me is me, and you is God."
20:43;20:45;"""Sweet Home Alabama."""
20:45;20:54;"In ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" Alabama is the secular governmental state known as Alabama,"
20:54;21:00;"but the gospel Christian version is more about sweet home, Zion, heaven."
21:00;21:02;"What happened to Cassie?"
21:02;21:03;"What happened to her career?"
21:03;21:04;"I don't know."
21:04;21:05;"She was, like, dating Diddy for a while."
21:05;21:09;"I hate that I know so much gossip about people's private lives."
21:09;21:13;"The next song from 2006--"
21:13;21:15;"Well, this was a big hit, man."
21:15;21:16;"Okay."
21:16;21:18;"Back in 2006."

21:22;21:25;"This sounds more like a different era."

21:28;21:29;"It'd be a hit."
21:29;21:31;"But at the time, it was kind of a throwback."
21:31;21:32;"Right."
21:32;21:33;"Wait."

23:01;23:05;"Yeah, this is kind of like--"

23:12;23:13;"Are they?"
23:13;23:15;"Yeah, they're pretty good."
23:15;23:18;"The Young Jock and the Cassie were--"
23:18;23:21;"they've been relegated to the dustbin of history"

23:23;23:24;"Come on."
23:24;23:26;"All these songs are good."
23:26;23:28;"I'm just saying, like--"
23:28;23:30;"Define good."
23:30;23:32;"You said so yourself, dude."
23:32;23:33;"You're not feeling it."
23:33;23:34;"I'm not Socrates, man."
23:34;23:36;"I'm not going to define good."
23:36;23:38;"No, but I'm saying more like, you know,"
23:38;23:40;"I thought listening to songs from 10 years ago"
23:40;23:43;"would maybe, like, trigger a wave of emotions"
23:43;23:45;"and Proustian memories."
23:45;23:47;"But so far, it hasn't."
23:47;23:50;"I remember I liked this song."
23:50;23:51;"I always loved that."
23:51;23:52;"[VOCALIZING]"
23:52;23:54;"Yeah, this is cool."
23:54;23:56;"I remember this, but I don't remember--"
23:56;23:58;"I like that kind of beautiful, almost like baroque--"
23:58;23:59;"Yeah."
23:59;24:00;"Who is this?"
24:00;24:02;"It's Shakira featuring Wyclef."
24:02;24:04;"This-- OK, this actually did trigger"
24:04;24:05;"a really stupid memory for me."
24:05;24:08;"So he goes, na, na, na, na, you could dance like this."
24:08;24:11;"She make a man want to speak Spanish."
24:11;24:12;"And I remember, like, somehow--"
24:12;24:14;"I don't know if I misheard it or something,"
24:14;24:16;"but I thought it was like, she make a man"
24:16;24:17;"want to speak Spanish."
24:17;24:20;"And then I would, like, picture, like, Wyclef--"
24:20;24:22;"like, that Wyclef met Shakira."
24:22;24:24;"And he was like, oh, my god, she's so beautiful."
24:24;24:26;"And then, like, six months of intensive study"
24:26;24:28;"of him just, like, in a Spanish-- like,"
24:28;24:30;"an adult education Spanish class."
24:30;24:32;"She make a man want to learn Spanish."
24:32;24:33;"And just, like--"
24:33;24:34;"Books on tape."
24:34;24:35;"Yeah, like, listening to books on tape,"
24:35;24:39;"like, doing worksheets, like, conjugating a star."
24:39;24:41;"Yeah."
24:41;24:42;"Me gusto."
24:42;24:45;"Oh, baby, when you talk like that,"
24:45;24:47;"you make a woman go mad."
24:47;24:51;"So be wise and keep on reading the signs of my blood."
24:51;24:52;"I love Shakira's voice."
24:52;24:53;"It's so unusual."
24:53;24:54;"Yeah."
24:54;24:55;"Where's she from?"
24:55;24:56;"South America or something?"
24:56;24:57;"Colombia."
24:57;24:58;"OK."
24:58;25:02;"She's-- I think she's, like, of partially Lebanese descent."
25:02;25:06;"I can see your body moving, and it's driving me crazy."
25:06;25:07;"This feels like--"
25:07;25:08;"This is corny."
25:08;25:09;"This feels like 15 years ago, actually."
25:09;25:11;"Until I saw you dancing."
25:11;25:13;"And when you walk up on the dance floor,"
25:13;25:16;"you move your body just like--"
25:16;25:18;"Listen to that, like--"
25:18;25:19;"[imitates bass]"
25:19;25:20;"That bass."
25:20;25:22;"You really knew that she could dance like this."
25:22;25:24;"She make a man want to speak Spanish."
25:24;25:25;"You know what the name of this album was?"
25:25;25:26;"Como se llama."
25:26;25:29;"Shakira, Shakira."
25:29;25:32;"Oh, baby, when you talk like that--"
25:32;25:33;"Shakira's a lot--"
25:33;25:34;"[laughter]"
25:34;25:36;"What is going on with her voice?"
25:36;25:39;"Shakira was standing a lot closer to the microphone"
25:39;25:40;"than Wyclef."
25:40;25:41;"Yeah, totally."
25:41;25:44;"You know my voice don't lie, I'm starting to feel your joy."
25:44;25:45;"Come on, let's go."
25:45;25:46;"Real slow."
25:46;25:48;"She definitely emailed her vocals in."
25:48;25:50;"I don't think I've ever listened closely"
25:50;25:51;"to her vocal performances."
25:51;25:52;"They're--"
25:52;25:55;"I used to be able to do a good Shakira impersonation."
25:55;25:57;"It almost gives me, like, a Shania vibe."
25:57;25:58;"I'm on tonight."
25:58;26:01;"You know my hips, hips don't lie."
26:01;26:02;"Wait, no, that's not good."
26:02;26:03;"That's not good."
26:03;26:05;"It's almost-- there's, like, a really flat American accent"
26:05;26:06;"or something."
26:06;26:08;"You seem to have a plan."
26:08;26:11;"My will, I'm so frustrated."
26:11;26:13;"I've come to fail, now, fail, now."
26:13;26:16;"See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so you know that's it."
26:16;26:18;"Too hard to explain."
26:18;26:19;"She's a--"
26:19;26:20;"Trippy."
26:20;26:23;"--a Colombian-Lebanese person, not American."
26:23;26:24;"That's trippy."
26:24;26:27;"The name of that album was ""Oral Fixation Volume 2."""
26:27;26:29;"Well, there you go, running theme at 06."
26:29;26:32;"2006, I guess, was the time of oral."
26:32;26:35;"I-- maybe this is not appropriate for the show,"
26:35;26:36;"but I think--"
26:36;26:37;"[laughter]"
26:37;26:40;"--the truth is there's only so many things that two humans"
26:40;26:42;"can do with each other--"
26:42;26:43;"Right."
26:43;26:44;"--in the bedroom."
26:44;26:45;"There's a ceiling."
26:46;26:48;"Like, you know, the internet, you can do different things"
26:48;26:49;"on the internet."
26:49;26:52;"But as far as two human beings, you can only put each thing"
26:52;26:54;"in so many places."
26:54;26:57;"And I want to say, personally, I think they're all OK,"
26:57;26:59;"and I think it's wonderful as long as two consenting adults"
26:59;27:00;"can do."
27:00;27:02;"They can put whatever they want together."
27:02;27:03;"I think that's beautiful, actually."
27:03;27:04;"Absolutely."
27:04;27:06;"But the funny thing is, because there's"
27:06;27:08;"a limited number of things that two consenting adults can"
27:08;27:12;"do with each other, it's been done for literally"
27:12;27:13;"tens of thousands of years."
27:13;27:14;"Yeah."
27:14;27:16;"So there's something so funny about how, like,"
27:16;27:21;"people at different moments find specific sexual acts so--"
27:21;27:24;"especially, like, titillating or humorous."
27:24;27:25;"Yeah."
27:25;27:27;"Like, I think, like, when we were kids, you know,"
27:27;27:30;"probably in large part rooted in homophobia,"
27:30;27:32;"when a kid really wanted to be funny,"
27:32;27:35;"they'd make a joke about, like, [bleep] somebody in the--"
27:35;27:36;"Right."
27:36;27:41;"Like, that was funny, as if that was a particularly titillating"
27:41;27:43;"or, like, out there--"
27:43;27:44;"Egregious."
27:44;27:45;"Yeah."
27:45;27:47;"And it's kind of like, you know what, man?"
27:47;27:49;"Like, people have been doing that for thousands"
27:49;27:50;"and thousands of years."
27:50;27:52;"It's not like it just got discovered."
27:52;27:54;"So then I think there's also-- were probably eras"
27:54;27:58;"where people thought, like, oral sex was particularly wild"
27:58;27:59;"or even, like, funny."
27:59;28:01;"So I just want to say to everybody out there,"
28:01;28:02;"none of it's funny."
28:02;28:03;"It's all beautiful."
28:03;28:04;"Grow up."
28:04;28:05;"Words of wisdom."
28:05;28:10;"So anyway, other people's sexualities should not be funny."
28:10;28:11;"Who cares?"
28:11;28:17;"The number one song of summer 2006 was kind of about that."
28:17;28:18;"Am I throwing you off?"
28:18;28:19;"Nope."
28:19;28:20;"Didn't think so."
28:21;28:22;"How you doing, young lady?"
28:22;28:23;"Ooh, this sounds good."
28:23;28:24;"Remember this?"
28:24;28:25;"Kind of."
28:25;28:26;"You don't have a play about to--"
28:26;28:28;"Nelly Furtado and Timbaland."
28:28;28:29;"Oh, OK."
28:29;28:30;"You looking for a girl that'll treat you right?"
28:30;28:32;"This song is a pre-sex negotiation."
28:32;28:33;"Yeah."
28:34;28:35;"It's classic."
28:35;28:36;"It's great."
28:40;28:41;"Oh, yeah, this one."
28:44;28:46;"I like those really sparkly synth clasps."
28:53;28:54;"I need it."
29:54;29:55;"Great song."
29:55;29:56;"Yeah."
29:56;29:59;"This song, it's about a promiscuous girl"
29:59;30:02;"and a promiscuous boy coming together"
30:02;30:06;"to negotiate the emotional terms of their sexual relationship."
30:06;30:07;"Right."
30:07;30:08;"Are you going to respect me after?"
30:08;30:11;"It's a conversation not enough people have, to be honest."
30:11;30:12;"Real."
30:12;30:14;"So it's a promiscuous boy and a promiscuous girl."
30:14;30:17;"It's not even a question of are you interested in having sex."
30:17;30:20;"Well, the first verse is sort of like, yeah,"
30:20;30:24;"like exploring the emotional terrain, which is kind of cool."
30:24;30:26;"It's pretty old school."
30:26;30:28;"It's like pretty-- it's kind of quaint, even."
30:28;30:30;"Like when you listen to old, like '60s--"
30:30;30:32;"Yeah, you know what it makes me think of?"
30:32;30:34;"There's an entire song."
30:34;30:35;"There's another song about that."
30:35;30:37;"It's cool that this is like between a guy and a girl."
30:37;30:39;"They're both expressing their concerns."
30:39;30:41;"But there's a big song in the '60s,"
30:41;30:44;"an early hit written by Carole King before her solo career."
30:44;30:45;"You know what I'm talking about?"
30:45;30:47;"I'm blanking, but I will when you say it."
30:47;30:49;"Oh, will you love me?"
30:49;30:50;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
30:50;30:53;"That entire song is about like I'm ready to engage"
30:53;30:55;"in sexual activity with you."
30:55;30:56;"Tonight."
30:56;30:57;"Yeah."
30:57;31:00;"Tonight's the night."
31:00;31:02;"There's some great lines in that."
31:02;31:04;"Will I do?"
31:04;31:05;"That song is incredible."
31:05;31:06;"Actually, I want to look it up."
31:06;31:08;"Let's check out the lyrics because I think--"
31:08;31:10;"OK, tonight you're mine completely."
31:10;31:12;"You give your love so sweetly."
31:12;31:16;"Tonight the light of love is in your eyes."
31:16;31:18;"Great melody."
31:18;31:21;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
31:21;31:24;"This is where the second verse really gets into it."
31:24;31:26;"Is this a lasting treasure?"
31:26;31:27;"Mm."
31:27;31:28;"Bom, bom, bom, bom."
31:28;31:31;"Or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:31;31:36;"Can I believe the magic of your sighs?"
31:36;31:40;"Will you still love me tomorrow?"
31:40;31:44;"Is this a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:44;31:47;"I'd like to complicate that binary."
31:47;31:49;"You're exhausted?"
31:49;31:50;"No, no, I'm in."
31:50;31:54;"I'm just saying like that's the question through most of life."
31:54;31:56;"Is something that happens a lasting treasure"
31:56;31:58;"or just a moment's pleasure?"
31:58;31:59;"Why can't it be both?"
31:59;32:02;"And I'm not just talking about sexual activity."
32:02;32:04;"Magical things happen in life."
32:04;32:07;"And we're kind of taught that if it's a one-off,"
32:07;32:08;"it's less meaningful."
32:08;32:09;"Right."
32:09;32:11;"Isn't that a problem as we go through life?"
32:11;32:12;"Live in the moment."
32:12;32:15;"Something good happens, a good moment happens."
32:15;32:18;"Ideally, it'll bring you pleasure for the rest of your life"
32:18;32:21;"as long as you're not like betting the farm on it."
32:21;32:23;"Beats one."
32:23;32:26;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
32:26;32:31;"Music's so hot, it'll melt your face off."
32:31;32:32;"Back to '06."
32:32;32:34;"I guess '06, there was a lot of--"
32:34;32:36;"Pretty sexual year if we look back through it."
32:36;32:38;"Pretty sexual summer."
32:38;32:39;"Although I do--"
32:39;32:41;"Pretty sexual summer?"
32:41;32:42;"2006, man."
32:42;32:45;"That was a sexual summer."
32:45;32:47;"Let's take it back to '96."
32:47;32:48;"Okay."
32:48;32:49;"1996."
32:49;32:51;"So, 1996, I was 12 years old, man."
32:51;32:53;"I was just a kid."
32:53;32:54;"I don't know what I was doing that summer."
32:54;32:56;"I was probably, you know, I was probably in New Jersey"
32:56;32:58;"just hanging out with friends,"
32:58;33:01;"walking around the suburbs,"
33:01;33:02;"seeing movies."
33:02;33:03;"Maybe I was at summer camp."
33:03;33:05;"I went to summer camp a couple summers as a youth."
33:05;33:06;"Oh."
33:06;33:07;"In Connecticut."
33:07;33:08;"Oh."
33:08;33:10;"I was in Connecticut in '96, too."
33:10;33:11;"Oh, really?"
33:11;33:14;"Working a landscaping gig."
33:14;33:16;"It was after my freshman year of college, so I was 19."
33:16;33:17;"So, you went--"
33:17;33:19;"So, freshman year of college, you go back home."
33:19;33:20;"Yeah."
33:20;33:21;"Still hanging out with the high school crew."
33:21;33:24;"Yep, and worked a landscaping gig at this mansion."
33:24;33:25;"Really?"
33:25;33:26;"Yeah."
33:26;33:28;"Like, you just landscaped one mansion all summer?"
33:28;33:29;"Yep, yep."
33:29;33:32;"They had a full-time landscaper or groundskeeper."
33:32;33:33;"This guy named Fabio."
33:33;33:34;"He's Portuguese."
33:34;33:36;"And then he hired--"
33:36;33:38;"He hired two people, so I was one of two assistants."
33:38;33:41;"Were you doing, like, a lot of shoveling?"
33:41;33:43;"Yeah, we were planting a huge hedge, as I remember."
33:43;33:44;"Yeah."
33:44;33:47;"There was a lot of, like, acres of mowing to do,"
33:47;33:50;"leaf blowing the tennis court, cleaning the pool."
33:50;33:53;"But they were doing, like, a major garden renovation."
33:53;33:55;"What kind of hat would you wear?"
33:55;33:58;"Would you wear, like, a really big sun hat to cover yourself?"
33:58;34:00;"Or you'd wear a baseball cap or nothing?"
34:00;34:02;"Yeah, either nothing or a baseball hat."
34:02;34:05;"Also recorded an album that summer with Dave, my brother."
34:05;34:06;"Oh, really?"
34:06;34:07;"Yeah."
34:07;34:08;"I've got to hear that."
34:08;34:09;"American People."
34:09;34:10;"Wait, was that the name of the band or the album?"
34:10;34:11;"Yeah, we made, like, five albums."
34:11;34:12;"Really?"
34:12;34:13;"You and Dave made five albums?"
34:13;34:14;"There's going to be a box set someday."
34:14;34:16;"Oh, I don't know if I've ever heard any of that."
34:16;34:17;"It's tight."
34:17;34:18;"Really?"
34:18;34:19;"Yeah."
34:19;34:20;"We should throw some of that up on the internet."
34:20;34:21;"Love to."
34:21;34:24;"So, let's get into the big music of '96."
34:24;34:25;"Let's see how it compares to 2006."
34:25;34:28;"As we delve further and further into the past."
34:28;34:29;"Prediction?"
34:29;34:30;"Yeah."
34:30;34:32;"This is going to sound a lot different than--"
34:32;34:34;"So, '06, 2016, we were sort of confused."
34:34;34:35;"Like, is this even that different?"
34:35;34:36;"Right."
34:36;34:38;"'96 is going to be, like, third eye blind."
34:38;34:39;"It's going to sound way different."
34:39;34:40;"We'll see."
34:40;34:43;"1996, this is Tupac with KC and JoJo."
34:43;34:44;"How do you want it?"
34:47;34:50;"(SINGING) How did you want it?"
34:50;34:52;"How did you feel?"
34:52;34:55;"Career as an indie in the cash game and in the fast lane."
34:55;34:58;"Ah, for real."
34:58;35:00;"How do you want it?"
35:00;35:01;"I wonder if--"
35:01;35:02;"When did Tupac die? '96?"
35:02;35:04;"I think he died in '96."
35:04;35:08;"I think Biggie and Tupac died in '96, right?"
35:08;35:10;"Dude, I saw Biggie play a show in '96."
35:10;35:11;"Really?"
35:11;35:12;"Yeah, at UConn."
35:12;35:13;"You saw Biggie live?"
35:13;35:14;"Yeah."
35:14;35:15;"In Connecticut?"
35:15;35:16;"Yeah, I went back for the said landscaping gig."
35:16;35:17;"Yeah."
35:17;35:19;"And then my friend John Joyce was like, hey, dude,"
35:19;35:23;"Violent Femmes and Notorious B.I.G. are playing at UConn."
35:23;35:25;"Violent Femmes and Notorious B.I.G.?"
35:25;35:26;"Yeah."
35:26;35:28;"Oh, so Tupac died September 13, '96."
35:28;35:29;"OK."
35:29;35:34;"So he had a big song on the radio the summer before he died."
35:34;35:35;"Yeah."
35:35;35:37;"(SINGING) --with the passport, just like a ladder."
35:37;35:39;"If you anything you ask for, it's either him or me."
35:39;35:42;"Champagne, Hennessy, and favorite of my homies"
35:42;35:43;"when we floss on our enemies."
35:43;35:45;"Witness as we creep to a low speed."
35:45;35:48;"People that owe me, pump some more with me."
35:48;35:51;"You don't need approaching, which is where the pass is."
35:51;35:53;"Been a long day, but I've been driven by tracks"
35:53;35:55;"in a strong way."
35:55;35:56;"Your body is banging, baby."
35:56;35:57;"I love it when you're flowing."
35:57;35:58;"Time to give it to daddy."
35:58;35:59;"Now tell me how you gonna--"
35:59;36:00;"(SINGING) --how do you want it?"
36:00;36:02;"How do you want it?"
36:02;36:04;"How do you feel?"
36:04;36:06;"Coming up as a nigga in a cash game."
36:06;36:08;"I'm living in the cash game."
36:08;36:10;"Living like a nigga."
36:10;36:12;"How do you want it?"
36:12;36:14;"How do you feel?"
36:14;36:17;"Coming up as a nigga in a cash game."
36:17;36:19;"I'm living in the cash game."
36:19;36:21;"Tell me, is it cool to [MUTED]"
36:21;36:24;"think I come to talk to my fool or what?"
36:24;36:26;"Positions on the floor, it's like erotic."
36:26;36:28;"Ironic 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic."
36:28;36:30;"I'm hitting switches on bitches like I've been fixed"
36:30;36:31;"when I drop it."
36:31;36:32;"Up and down like a roller coaster."
36:32;36:35;"I'm up inside, and I ain't quitting 'til the show is over."
36:35;36:37;"Man, you look so crazy."
36:37;36:40;"I mean, this is like not an original observation,"
36:40;36:42;"but those guys are so young."
36:42;36:43;"You're like, what, 24 or something?"
36:43;36:45;"Yeah, mid-20s."
36:45;36:47;"Casey and JoJo are still around."
36:47;36:48;"I don't know."
36:48;36:49;"I'm not sure what they're up to, but--"
36:49;36:51;"All my life."
36:51;36:52;"Love Casey and JoJo."
36:52;36:54;"Yeah."
36:54;36:56;"So yeah, that sounds like a long time ago."
36:56;36:58;"How about this?"
36:58;37:00;"Also '96, summer '96."
37:03;37:05;"You know, I had no idea when this song was from."
37:05;37:06;"This is such a timeless song."
37:06;37:07;"Is this Tracy Chapman?"
37:07;37:08;"Yeah."
37:08;37:11;"So she came out in the '80s, like fast cars from the '80s."
37:11;37:12;"Is it?"
37:12;37:14;"Yeah."
37:14;37:15;"This is gnarly."
37:15;37:16;"Really?"
37:16;37:18;"This seems right up your alley, man."
37:18;37:21;"I'm not into, like, bluesy coffee shop."
37:21;37:24;"Although, I like this patient intro."
37:24;37:25;"Yeah, man."
37:25;37:26;"Almost no vocals."
37:26;37:28;"We're at the 30-second mark."
37:28;37:30;"Just like guitar."
37:30;37:34;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here,"
37:34;37:36;"and I'll turn my back around."
37:36;37:37;"Actually sounds pretty tight."
37:37;37:38;"Yeah, come on."
37:38;37:39;"I'm in."
37:39;37:40;"I love Tracy."
37:40;37:41;"I'm in."
37:41;37:44;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here,"
37:44;37:46;"and I'll turn my back around."
37:46;37:48;"Tracy Chapman wrote a lot of good songs,"
37:48;37:51;"but two just, like, bonafide classics."
37:51;37:54;"""Fast Car"" and ""Give Me One Reason."""
37:54;37:55;"(SINGING) You gotta make me--"
37:55;37:57;"This feels like one of those songs that she just sat down"
37:57;38:00;"and grabbed the guitar and just, like, poured out of her."
38:00;38:01;"Yeah."
38:01;38:03;"(SINGING) Baby, I got your number."
38:03;38:04;"Ah."
38:04;38:05;"Don't need those drums."
38:05;38:06;"Yeah, that was--"
38:06;38:07;"[LAUGHS]"
38:07;38:08;"That kind of took me out of it."
38:08;38:10;"Mm-hmm."
38:10;38:12;"We don't need that stock guitar noodling."
38:12;38:14;"(SINGING) You know what I call you."
38:14;38:16;"I call too many times."
38:16;38:19;"Imagine any other voice singing this song."
38:19;38:22;"It would sound like library music."
38:22;38:23;"Go for it."
38:23;38:25;"(SINGING) You can call me any time."
38:25;38:28;"I don't even want to try it."
38:28;38:30;"Yeah, I don't even know, like, what--"
38:30;38:31;"like, try to--"
38:31;38:33;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here,"
38:33;38:36;"and I'll turn my back around."
38:36;38:39;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here,"
38:39;38:41;"and I'll turn my back around."
38:41;38:43;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here."
38:43;38:46;"And I'll turn my back around."
38:46;38:52;"Well, I know, and I know, and I told him that I'm done."
38:52;38:54;"This song is kind of like--"
38:54;38:56;"I mean, they're both just, like, kind of blues tropes."
38:56;38:57;"Yeah."
38:57;38:58;"But this song's kind of like the--"
38:58;39:00;"it's very similar, actually, to, like,"
39:00;39:03;"(SINGING) Should I stay or should I go?"
39:03;39:06;"So you got to let me know."
39:06;39:09;"Should I-- should I cool it or should I blow?"
39:09;39:11;"(SINGING) I don't want no one to squeeze me."
39:11;39:13;"This is kind of like a more elegant version of"
39:13;39:14;"Should I Stay or Should I Go?"
39:14;39:15;"Yeah."
39:15;39:17;"Like, Should I Stay or Should I Go is, like, very, like--"
39:17;39:20;"like, just kind of punky British, you know, like,"
39:20;39:21;"the clash, like--"
39:21;39:22;"Yeah, very stiff."
39:22;39:24;"(SINGING) Should I stay or should I go?"
39:24;39:25;"And this is like--"
39:25;39:28;"(SINGING) Give me one reason to stay here."
39:28;39:30;"This is, like, a lot more elegant and subtle."
39:30;39:32;"I mean, they're both good songs."
39:32;39:33;"Whatever."
39:36;39:39;"Give me one reason to stay here,"
39:39;39:40;"and I'll turn right back around."
39:40;39:42;"So she's out the door."
39:42;39:43;"Yeah."
39:43;39:45;"But she doesn't want to go."
39:45;39:46;"Yeah, you're looking for--"
39:46;39:49;"I think a lot of times in life--"
39:49;39:50;"[laughs]"
39:50;39:52;"Going to turn this into a life lesson?"
39:52;39:53;"Uncle Ezra."
39:53;39:56;"A lot of times in life, man, you, um--"
39:56;39:58;"(SINGING) The youthful heart can love you."
39:58;40:00;"You know, we're social animals."
40:00;40:01;"You know what I mean?"
40:01;40:04;"Human beings are social beasts."
40:04;40:05;"Yeah."
40:05;40:09;"We rely on other people, a sense of community."
40:09;40:11;"We don't like to just make decisions"
40:11;40:13;"built on self-interest."
40:13;40:16;"But sometimes you just need that one reason."
40:16;40:19;"You want to show compassion to another person,"
40:19;40:21;"but they're giving you all the wrong signs."
40:21;40:23;"Give me one reason, man."
40:23;40:25;"Just one reason."
40:25;40:28;"One reason to stay here."
40:28;40:29;"It's a modest request."
40:29;40:31;"(SINGING) Turn around."
40:31;40:34;"You can see me tired."
40:34;40:36;"Give me one reason to stay here."
40:36;40:39;"Oh, I'd turn right back around."
40:39;40:41;"Turn around."
40:41;40:43;"You can see me tired."
40:43;40:46;"Said I don't want to leave you lonely."
40:46;40:48;"You've got to make me change my mind."
40:48;40:55;"Baby, just give me one reason."
40:55;40:57;"Oh, give me just one reason why."
40:58;41:02;"Baby, just give me one reason."
41:02;41:05;"Oh, give me just one reason why."
41:05;41:08;"I should stay."
41:08;41:11;"Said I told you that I loved you."
41:11;41:14;"And there ain't no more to say."
41:14;41:16;"You can go either way, too, because you can ask"
41:16;41:21;"to get one reason to be the larger person"
41:21;41:23;"and look past things."
41:23;41:25;"Or it could be like Joe Pesci style."
41:25;41:27;"Give me one reason why I shouldn't."
41:27;41:28;"Right, right."
41:28;41:30;"Give me one--"
41:30;41:32;"Give me one damn reason."
41:32;41:33;"Why I shouldn't just--"
41:33;41:34;"Kick the shit out of you."
41:34;41:36;"Yeah, just beat your ass."
41:36;41:40;"The next song from Summer '96-- oh, this is a great song."
41:40;41:41;"[MUSIC - ""BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM""]"
41:41;41:42;"Oh, yeah."
41:42;41:46;"(SINGING) Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
41:46;41:48;"Tell me what you're going to do."
41:48;41:50;"And it ain't no inner problem."
41:50;41:52;"Judgement comes for you."
41:52;41:55;"Judgement comes for you."
41:55;41:57;"Tell me what you're going to do."
41:57;41:59;"And it ain't no inner problem."
41:59;42:00;"Judgement comes for you."
42:00;42:02;"Because it's going to come for you."
42:02;42:05;"[MUSIC - ""BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM""]"
42:05;42:07;"Such an original style, I was just going to say."
42:07;42:08;"Boom, boom."
42:08;42:10;"(SINGING) And I'm going to miss everybody."
42:10;42:12;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
42:12;42:14;"This is a huge song in the '90s."
42:14;42:15;"Yeah."
42:15;42:17;"(SINGING) Little lads, I got you big."
42:17;42:19;"Tell me you're peachy, but see, it's pretty peach."
42:21;42:23;"This is a song about loss."
42:23;42:25;"Talking about different people who died."
42:25;42:26;"(SINGING) God is who we pray."
42:26;42:28;"Even though the devil's all up in my face,"
42:28;42:29;"but he's keeping me safe."
42:29;42:30;"He's keeping me safe."
42:32;42:35;"Now, what is the Crossroads actually referred to?"
42:35;42:37;"Because-- Heaven?"
42:37;42:39;"I think so."
42:39;42:41;"Because it's interesting, because the other famous Crossroads"
42:41;42:43;"song is--"
42:43;42:44;"Robert Johnson."
42:45;42:48;"And Robert Johnson's Crossroads, his old blues song,"
42:48;42:50;"he met the devil at the Crossroads."
42:50;42:52;"Right."
42:52;42:55;"That's where Eric Clapton sold his soul."
42:55;42:58;"Eric Clapton met the devil."
42:58;43:00;"Jimmy Page."
43:00;43:01;"Right, that's interesting."
43:01;43:03;"Yeah, so is the Crossroads heaven or--"
43:03;43:06;"I think in this case, it's heaven."
43:06;43:09;"I guess the Crossroads is referred to an intersection."
43:09;43:10;"(SINGING)"
43:10;43:12;"So that I don't want to meet you up at the crossroads."
43:12;43:15;"You'll know if I ever got love in them both those big, big--"
43:15;43:16;"(SINGING)"
43:16;43:18;"Really wish you could come home."
43:18;43:20;"But when it's time to die, I got to go bye-bye."
43:20;43:22;"All I look up to do is cry, cry."
43:22;43:23;"Why'd I kill my dog?"
43:23;43:24;"Damn, man, I miss my--"
43:24;43:27;"The album is named after Crossroads in Cleveland."
43:27;43:30;"There's a literal local reference,"
43:30;43:33;"but obviously it takes a metaphorical resonance"
43:33;43:35;"as well."
43:35;43:37;"I mean, the Crossroads, it's a--"
43:37;43:39;"I mean, also in life."
43:39;43:41;"You come to a Crossroads."
43:41;43:42;"(SINGING)"
43:42;43:43;"So you know about the Crossroads."
43:43;43:44;"It's a beautiful song."
43:44;43:45;"Yeah."
43:45;43:47;"And again, such an original band."
43:47;43:48;"(SINGING)"
43:48;43:51;"So you know about the Crossroads."
43:57;44:01;"So you know about the Crossroads."
44:01;44:03;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
44:03;44:06;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
44:06;44:08;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
44:10;44:13;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
44:13;44:15;"And I'm going to miss everybody."
44:15;44:16;"Living in a hateful world."
44:16;44:17;"Sitting in the straight and narrow."
44:17;44:18;"That's how we were."
44:18;44:19;"Living in a hateful world."
44:19;44:20;"Sitting in the straight and narrow."
44:20;44:21;"That's how we were."
44:21;44:23;"Living in a hateful world."
44:23;44:24;"Sitting in the straight and narrow."
44:24;44:25;"That's how we were."
44:25;44:27;"And I'm asking the good Lord, why is I?"
44:27;44:28;"He told me we lived in time."
44:28;44:29;"Was I running around?"
44:29;44:30;"See my bigger cousin was home."
44:30;44:31;"Somebody running around."
44:31;44:33;"Everybody want to test us out."
44:33;44:35;"And this sneeze is too easy to find."
44:35;44:37;"And nobody's telling me 'cause he ain't telling no--"
44:37;44:38;"what it mean?"
44:38;44:40;"But it come again, again and again."
44:40;44:42;"Tell me what you're going to do."
44:42;44:44;"Can somebody, anybody tell me why?"
44:44;44:47;"Can somebody, anybody tell me why?"
44:47;44:48;"We die, we die."
44:48;44:49;"I don't want to die."
44:49;44:50;"Love Bone Thugs."
44:50;44:52;"2006 was a pretty sexual summer."
44:52;44:58;"But '96 is maybe a little more like romantic or like--"
44:58;45:00;"I don't know how to describe it."
45:00;45:02;"Maybe innocent."
45:02;45:05;"The height of the Clinton years."
45:05;45:08;"Definitely a less tumultuous time."
45:08;45:09;"Yeah."
45:09;45:10;"In terms of the fabric of--"
45:10;45:11;"A seemingly less tumultuous time."
45:11;45:13;"--the texture of life, if we're going to generalize."
45:13;45:16;"Another huge song from summer '96 is Tony Braxton."
45:16;45:22;"Oh, yeah, this is so '90s."
45:22;45:25;"It's a little elevated music vibe until the vocals come in."
45:25;45:37;"Love these patient intros."
45:37;45:40;"Welcome to the Tulsa Ramada Inn."
45:40;45:46;"If we can-- we hope your stay with us is beautiful."
45:46;45:50;"If you want any information on local restaurants or houses"
45:50;45:53;"of worship, please call."
45:53;45:55;"Dial 9 for an outside connection."
45:55;46:00;"Once the vocals come in, it doesn't sound like--"
46:00;46:03;"Right."
46:03;46:06;"I'm picturing those really heavy, light-proof curtains"
46:06;46:09;"in a hotel room where there's a weird switch."
46:09;46:11;"Yeah."
46:11;46:12;"To open them up."
46:12;46:15;"To open them up."
46:15;46:16;"All right, Tony Braxton."
46:16;46:17;"I don't know that song at all."
46:17;46:19;"Well, you remember--"
46:19;46:22;"(SINGING) Unbreak my heart."
46:22;46:24;"Say you love me again."
46:24;46:25;"I don't know."
46:25;46:28;"I have trouble with those super slow, kind of gaudy ballads."
46:28;46:29;"Gaudy?"
46:29;46:30;"Yeah."
46:30;46:31;"What's gaudy about it?"
46:31;46:33;"I mean, maybe some arrangement."
46:33;46:34;"It's just like--"
46:34;46:35;"I can't listen to that."
46:35;46:38;"(SINGING) Let it fly."
46:38;46:41;"Everything's going to work out right now."
46:41;46:43;"Just let it go."
46:43;46:45;"Let it blow."
46:45;46:46;"Let it blow."
46:46;46:49;"Let it go."
46:49;46:53;"Just let it go, baby."
46:53;46:55;"Tony Braxton."
46:55;46:58;"I said this to Mike D in my interview with Mike D."
46:58;47:01;"I saw on the internet that she's dating Birdman."
47:01;47:02;"Birdman?"
47:02;47:03;"Baby."
47:03;47:04;"You're losing me here, dude."
47:04;47:05;"All right, whatever."
47:05;47:08;"To anybody who cares, that's Ezra's Gossip Corner."
47:08;47:10;"Who the hell's Birdman?"
47:10;47:13;"He's a businessman slash rapper."
47:13;47:15;"I thought you meant she's dating Michael Keaton."
47:15;47:18;"Yeah, well, stranger things have happened."
47:18;47:21;"The biggest song, ""Summer '96."""
47:21;47:23;"This one will take you way back, man."
47:23;47:25;"This is going to make you feel good."
47:25;47:28;"[MUSIC - ""SUMMER '96""]"
47:28;47:30;"Recognize it yet?"
47:30;47:31;"Is this Macarena?"
47:31;47:32;"Yeah."
47:32;47:34;"This is so Yankee Stadium."
47:34;47:37;"[MUSIC - ""SUMMER '96""]"
47:37;47:45;"Now, a lot of people forget, the hit version was a remix."
47:45;47:49;"Yeah, this doesn't sound quite familiar."
47:49;47:51;"Yeah, once the vocals come in."
47:51;47:55;"Because Los Del Rio are like some kind of older guys."
47:55;47:56;"Wait, so--"
47:56;47:58;"This is the Bayside Boys remixed it."
47:58;48:00;"Wait, so who's the artist here?"
48:00;48:01;"Los Del Rio."
48:01;48:03;"They were like the guys in suits."
48:03;48:06;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
48:06;48:11;"Wow, listen to how out of tune the vocals are."
48:11;48:15;"That's awesome."
48:15;48:17;"It was a different universe before autotune."
48:17;48:18;"I like it."
48:18;48:19;"Yeah, I love it too."
48:19;48:22;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
48:22;48:25;"Remember, these were like the dudes in suits."
48:25;48:26;"Kind of."
48:26;48:29;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
48:31;48:33;"This was a dance sensation."
48:33;48:38;"Now batting for the New York Yankees, Jim Leyriz, number 13."
48:38;48:41;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
48:41;48:52;"Now, come on."
48:52;48:53;"What was I supposed to do?"
48:53;48:55;"He was out of town."
48:55;48:58;"And his two friends were so fine."
48:58;49:01;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
49:01;49:04;"[SINGING IN SPANISH]"
49:08;49:19;"[MUSIC - ""LOS DEL RIO""]"
49:20;49:23;"[SINGING IN SPANISH]"
49:23;49:41;"Yeah, this was like you're watching a Yankees game,"
49:41;49:44;"and they're playing the Kansas City Royals in Kansas City."
49:44;49:47;"And then they're playing this during the seventh inning"
49:47;49:48;"stretch."
49:48;49:51;"And the camera's panning around the stadium."
49:51;49:54;"So Los Del Rio are actually from Spain."
49:54;49:58;"Macarena is a dance a lot of people did in the '90s."
49:58;50:03;"A fun fact, Macarena is about a woman named Macarena."
50:03;50:06;"That must have been kind of weird if your name was Macarena"
50:06;50:08;"back in '96."
50:08;50:09;"Oh my god, going to work."
50:09;50:12;"It is kind of a nice name, if you can forget about this."
50:12;50:15;"People got very annoyed by that song, because it was so huge"
50:15;50:16;"after a while."
50:16;50:19;"It's kind of smacks of ethnic novelty song."
50:19;50:21;"It's just like, eh."
50:21;50:22;"So what?"
50:22;50:26;"Well, no one was like, that song is so awesome."
50:26;50:27;"Well, it's because it's--"
50:27;50:31;"any song that people primarily know for the dance,"
50:31;50:35;"people are not going to give it props for being deep."
50:35;50:37;"But that's on them if they want to say that the body and the"
50:37;50:39;"mind are not connected."
50:39;50:40;"I don't subscribe to that."
50:40;50:41;"Far from it."
50:41;50:42;"So that was '96."
50:42;50:45;"I don't know if it's like some Stephen Hawking thing,"
50:45;50:49;"but as we dig deeper into the past, I feel a sense of exhaustion."
50:49;50:51;"[laughter]"
50:51;50:54;"As we move deeper into the sands of time."
50:54;50:56;"It's one."
50:56;51:00;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
51:00;51:04;"It's so hot, it'll melt your face off."
51:04;51:06;"All right, so that was '96."
51:06;51:07;"'86 is going to be weird."
51:07;51:08;"Are you ready for '86?"
51:08;51:09;"It's going to be weird."
51:09;51:11;"Also, it was like, OK--"
51:11;51:12;"Summer '86."
51:12;51:14;"We're doing summer songs, you know, like the summer jams"
51:14;51:15;"kind of thing."
51:15;51:18;"There's a difference between summer jams and then like a song"
51:18;51:21;"that was just a hit, incidentally, during the summer."
51:21;51:24;"And I feel like in '86, we're going to get some, like,"
51:24;51:27;"I don't know, some white snake or something."
51:27;51:28;"It's just going to be like--"
51:28;51:31;"So you're differentiating between--look, if a song's a hit, right."
51:31;51:34;"Because if a song's a hit in the summer, what people call a"
51:34;51:36;"summer hit has to be like kind of fun."
51:36;51:38;"Like Macarena is a summer hit for sure."
51:38;51:42;"Like even if there was--it has to be fun and light."
51:42;51:45;"I don't know why that Tony Braxton song was a summer hit."
51:45;51:47;"It was just a big--it was popular in the summer."
51:47;51:48;"I get it."
51:48;51:52;"Right, because like when people talk about the song of the summer,"
51:52;51:54;"they're not going to pick like an Adele ballad,"
51:54;51:56;"even if that is one of the biggest songs of the summer."
51:56;51:57;"Right."
51:57;52:01;"A summer song has to be kind of fun, maybe a little sexy."
52:01;52:02;"Yeah."
52:02;52:04;"I'm picturing '86--'86 is going to be weird."
52:04;52:05;"It will be."
52:05;52:06;"So I was 9."
52:06;52:07;"You were 9?"
52:07;52:09;"And you were 2."
52:09;52:10;"I was 2."
52:10;52:11;"I was a baby."
52:11;52:14;"So you were in your family's--maybe just moving to New Jersey."
52:14;52:15;"I remember '86."
52:15;52:16;"I have no memories of it."
52:16;52:19;"Mets, huge series, crazy series."
52:19;52:21;"Wait, is that when they beat the Red Sox?"
52:21;52:22;"The Red Sox."
52:22;52:23;"Yeah."
52:23;52:24;"Game 6, that was the--"
52:24;52:25;"Bill Buckner?"
52:25;52:26;"Exactly."
52:26;52:27;"Epic."
52:27;52:28;"Were you a Mets fan?"
52:28;52:29;"Yeah, I was a baseball fan."
52:29;52:31;"I was a New York baseball fan."
52:31;52:33;"When you're 9, you know, it's a little more fluid."
52:33;52:35;"Yankees, Mets."
52:35;52:39;"It's so weird to me that like kids are into sport--I mean,"
52:39;52:42;"maybe I just don't relate to it because I wasn't raised with sports."
52:42;52:44;"I feel like when you're 9, when I think of baseball,"
52:44;52:46;"I just think of like stats and stuff."
52:46;52:50;"So it's like when I picture like a 9-year-old kid being into baseball,"
52:50;52:52;"there's just like something funny about like a 9-year-old kid"
52:52;52:56;"thinking about like RBIs and like the lineup and like--"
52:56;52:58;"He drove it 145 runs, dude."
52:58;52:59;"Yeah."
52:59;53:01;"His slugging percentage was like 550 or something."
53:01;53:04;"Like baseball is so complicated in a way that even just like a 9-year-old--"
53:04;53:07;"9-year-old kids I can understand being into superheroes."
53:07;53:08;"I mean, I respect it."
53:08;53:10;"Like all respect to 9-year-old kids who are--"
53:10;53:13;"Slugging percentage is total bases divided by at-bats."
53:13;53:15;"[laughs]"
53:15;53:17;"It's weird."
53:17;53:21;"So this song was big in summer of '86."
53:21;53:25;"Genesis, ""Invisible Touch."""
53:25;53:29;"Phil Collins was--he was killing it as a solo artist"
53:29;53:31;"and a member of Genesis in the '80s."
53:31;53:32;"Yeah."
53:32;53:36;"♪"
53:36;53:42;"♪ Well, I've been waiting, waiting here so long ♪"
53:42;53:43;"This is a good song."
53:43;53:44;"It kind of depresses me, though."
53:44;53:45;"It's like--"
53:45;53:46;"Why? The tones?"
53:46;53:47;"I don't know, something about the synth."
53:47;53:49;"It makes me think of like the never-ending story"
53:49;53:53;"or just like a weird '80s kids movie"
53:53;53:56;"that tend to be somewhat depressing."
53:56;53:58;"Great voice."
53:58;53:59;"I know what you mean."
53:59;54:04;"♪"
54:59;55:02;"♪"
55:02;55:06;"So guys, everybody who doesn't remember 1986,"
55:06;55:07;"these songs that we're playing now,"
55:07;55:09;"this is what was happening in the summer,"
55:09;55:12;"so just picture whatever you're doing now,"
55:12;55:14;"but you're doing it in 1986."
55:14;55:16;"This would have been the soundtrack of your life."
55:16;55:17;"You know what's crazy?"
55:17;55:19;"My dad in '86 was 39."
55:19;55:20;"Really?"
55:20;55:22;"Yeah, so he was my age then."
55:22;55:23;"Just listening to--"
55:23;55:26;"And it's funny to think about him catching us on the radio"
55:26;55:29;"and just like, ""What did it sound like to him?"""
55:29;55:30;"Right."
55:30;55:32;"Probably very stiff and synthetic."
55:32;55:34;"Yeah, what's happening to music, man?"
55:34;55:35;"Go back, throw in that Dylan record."
55:35;55:36;"Yeah, he'd probably turn it off"
55:36;55:38;"and just pop in that Dylan cassette."
55:38;55:39;"Yeah."
55:39;55:41;"Another song from summer '86, ""Billy Ocean."""
55:41;55:42;"I don't know if I know this one."
55:42;55:45;"There'll be sad songs to make you cry."
55:49;55:51;"I'm guessing this is the ballad."
56:02;56:05;"Welcome to the Omaha Airport Hilton."
56:05;56:11;"Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes"
56:11;56:14;"When I'm standing beside you"
56:14;56:17;"There's a fever burning deep inside"
56:17;56:19;"I feel like nowadays,"
56:19;56:22;"you can't go quite this ballady and have a hit."
56:22;56:23;"Right."
56:23;56:26;"There's still sad songs, slower songs, but I don't know."
56:26;56:30;"When it's this spacious and the BPM is this low."
56:30;56:31;"Yeah."
56:31;56:35;"I always stop and think of you especially"
56:35;56:38;"When the words of a love song"
56:38;56:42;"Touch the very heart of me"
56:42;56:48;"There'll be sad songs to make you cry"
56:48;56:52;"Love songs often do"
56:52;56:59;"They can touch the heart of someone new"
56:59;57:03;"Saying I love you"
57:03;57:06;"I love you"
57:06;57:11;"I often wonder how it could be"
57:11;57:14;"You loving me"
57:14;57:18;"Two hearts in perfect harmony"
57:18;57:23;"I'll count the hours until that day"
57:23;57:30;"Rhapsody plays a melody for you and me"
57:30;57:34;"Until the moment that you give your love to me"
57:34;57:36;"I don't think I've ever heard this song."
57:36;57:39;"It's weird. It's a sad song about sad songs."
57:39;57:41;"I'm tired. That one's just putting me to sleep, man."
57:41;57:43;"No disrespect to Billy Ocean."
57:43;57:46;"Here's an up-tempo one from Summer '86."
57:46;57:48;"Oh, okay."
57:48;57:50;"Such an '80s sound."
57:50;57:52;"Dude, people don't remember in the '80s,"
57:52;57:55;"this was a big sound."
57:55;57:56;"Kung fu."
57:56;58:00;"I think that, but it's like..."
58:00;58:02;"Da-da-da-da."
58:02;58:05;"I wonder if that's a real flute"
58:05;58:11;"or if it was like a DX7."
58:11;58:14;"I bet it was real."
58:14;58:16;"Peter Gabriel seems like the kind of guy"
58:16;58:19;"that would be reverent towards getting a dude in there"
58:19;58:24;"that can actually play that recording."
58:24;58:26;"Song's called ""Fledgehammer."""
58:26;58:29;"Didn't we talk about Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel"
58:29;58:30;"on a recent episode?"
58:30;58:31;"Yeah."
58:31;58:32;"Here they are."
58:32;58:35;"They're both singers of Genesis,"
58:35;58:37;"both killing it in '86."
58:37;58:41;"If you just lay down your tracks"
58:41;58:47;"You could have an airplane flyin'"
58:47;58:51;"If you bring your blue sky back"
58:51;58:55;"All you do is call me"
58:55;59:01;"I'll be anything you need"
59:01;59:06;"You could have a big tipper"
59:06;59:11;"Going up and down all around the bend"
59:11;59:16;"You could have a bumper car bumpin'"
59:16;59:21;"There's amusement never ends"
59:21;59:25;"I wanna be"
59:25;59:28;"Fledgehammer"
59:28;59:33;"Why don't you call my name"
59:33;59:38;"Oh let me be your sledgehammer"
59:38;59:43;"This will be my testimony"
59:43;59:47;"So far there's been very little references to sex in '86."
59:47;59:50;"I don't know if sledgehammer is a phallic thing,"
59:50;59:53;"but these songs don't drip with sex."
59:53;59:54;"No."
59:54;59:58;"The second biggest song of Summer '86 was Peter Cetera,"
59:58;01:00:01;"who was from the band Chicago, I believe."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"This is a soundtrack song."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"It's from The Karate Kid Part II."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"Nice."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"Glory of Love."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"This is a good one."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"You know this one?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I don't think I know it."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"You know this, dude."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"Well, Cetera is the guy that sang"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"some of those huge Chicago ballads."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"If You Need Me, Leave Me Now?"
01:00:20;01:00:21;"Yeah, yeah."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Tonight it's very clear"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"This sounds depressing."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"I'm in."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Let's listen to it to the chorus."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"I want to say"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"I will always love you"
01:00:36;01:00:41;"I would never leave you alone"
01:00:41;01:00:44;"This is about the Karate Kid's relationship"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"to his mentor, Mr. Miyagi."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Sometimes I just forget"
01:00:49;01:00:54;"Yeah, this is such a weird emotional and aesthetic palette"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"that we're into right now."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"So it is."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"It's like"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"I don't want to lose you"
01:01:03;01:01:08;"I could never make it through"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"Yeah, they're swinging for the fences with every choice."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Here we go."
01:01:12;01:01:18;"I am the man who will fight for your honor"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:19;01:01:25;"I'll be the hero you're dreaming of"
01:01:25;01:01:28;"We'll live forever"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Knowing today"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"Okay, this is kind of a beautiful song."
01:01:32;01:01:39;"I'll be the hero for the glory of love"
01:01:39;01:01:47;"You keep me standing tall"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"You help me move it all"
01:01:50;01:01:57;"I'm always down when you're beside me"
01:01:57;01:02:01;"I have always needed you"
01:02:01;01:02:06;"I could never make it through"
01:02:06;01:02:16;"I am the man who will fight for your honor"
01:02:16;01:02:23;"I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of"
01:02:23;01:02:26;"We'll live forever"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"Knowing together"
01:02:29;01:02:36;"That we did it all for the glory of love"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Keyboard sounds--"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"I mean, it's interesting 'cause he's like--"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"I like that lyric."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"He's going for it in every respect."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"There's no self-consciousness about, like,"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"""Is this too much? Is this cheesy?"""
01:02:49;01:02:51;"Even just, like, the sentiment,"
01:02:51;01:02:54;"you would never have a song by anybody, like,"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"that says, ""I am the man who will fight for your honor."""
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Can you imagine singing that with a straight face, dude?"
01:02:59;01:03:02;"I want to try to because I do feel like, you know,"
01:03:02;01:03:06;"our generation's been weighed down by ironic distance."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Yeah, post-modernism, basically."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Post-modernism, just the shattering of our belief systems,"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"and it makes it hard to just straightforwardly say something,"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"but that's something that I feel."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"What's weird about--"
01:03:17;01:03:21;"When I look in a woman's eyes, I feel that, that I--"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"You want to fight for her honor."
01:03:23;01:03:25;"Wait, is it ""I am the man"" or ""I am""?"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"Yeah, ""I am the man,"" not ""a man."""
01:03:28;01:03:31;"I'm a guy that would fight for your honor."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"""I am the man who will fight for your honor."""
01:03:33;01:03:34;"It's like medieval."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"It's like ""Game of Thrones."""
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Yeah, it really is ""Game of Thrones."""
01:03:37;01:03:39;"You know what else? Can I point something out?"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"There's something-- I don't remember the movie,"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"so I can't say, but isn't there something funny"
01:03:43;01:03:48;"about being like, ""Peter, we need you to write a theme song"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"for 'The Karate Kid Part 2.'"""
01:03:51;01:03:55;"It's about a child learning how to do karate."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"Got it."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"♪ I am the man who will fight for your honor ♪"
01:04:00;01:04:03;"You have to wonder if that's a song that he had just lying around."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Right."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"""I am the kid who will fight for karate."""
01:04:07;01:04:08;"That would have made a lot more sense."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Or imagine he's in some dark room,"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"and they're doing the screening of the film,"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"and he's just writing the song passionately."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"He's just watching Ralph Macchio"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"just hammering through some wooden planks,"
01:04:20;01:04:24;"and he's like, ""I am the man who will fight for your honor."""
01:04:24;01:04:25;"There's something--"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"The glory of love."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"I'm intrigued with this postmodern thing"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"because it's hard to imagine, like we said--"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"I guess Tracy Chapman, there's a little bit"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"of that completely sincere, unselfconscious vibe"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"in her song from '96,"
01:04:38;01:04:42;"but in '86, I feel like we're really in this territory"
01:04:42;01:04:46;"of people just like the Phil Collins and the Peter Cetera."
01:04:46;01:04:49;"And I think that's maybe why people laugh at Phil Collins now."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Is that it is so earnest and sincere,"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"and we can't deal with that anymore."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"And in '86, there was a huge kind of punk underground"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"that was like under the surface,"
01:05:00;01:05:03;"and then after that sort of emerged mainstream,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"something happened to our collective--"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"You know what?"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"Maybe it makes sense that songs today are more about sex"
01:05:09;01:05:12;"because maybe it is hard for people to believe"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"in these really earnest, giant idea of like eternal love."
01:05:15;01:05:16;"Yeah."
01:05:16;01:05:18;"It's hard for us to believe, man."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"You know, like the majority of marriages end in divorce, man."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"Did you know that?"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"And also we've seen the ""family values"""
01:05:25;01:05:29;"used as a right-wing tactic"
01:05:29;01:05:34;"to, you know, oppress different ways of living."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"So maybe it's understandable that people are like,"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"""You know what?"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"""The one thing you can believe in in this life,"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"""it's not the glory of love."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"""It's not invisible touch."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"""It's sex."""
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Right."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"Like maybe it's just like--"
01:05:46;01:05:49;"And maybe the thing about the '80s music that's so awkward"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"is that it's in between--"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"So in like the mid-20th century--"
01:05:53;01:05:56;"So if you listen to like an Otis Redding song from the '60s,"
01:05:56;01:06:00;"he would sing as earnestly about love as Peter Cetera,"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"but we don't think it's funny, and we don't think it's laughable."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"And maybe because we weren't around then,"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"I don't know what--"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"You know, somehow you could pull off"
01:06:08;01:06:11;"a very sincere, unselfconscious sentiment in the '60s."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"I don't know. Yeah, something broke."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Something-- Exactly."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Something broke, and you can't put the genie back in the bottle."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"Something in the Western soul broke."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"Nixon."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"I'm going to say it's '68."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Yeah, it was f*cking Nixon, man."
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Everything comes back to Nixon on this show."
01:06:25;01:06:30;"America was already, obviously, a very messed-up place before '68,"
01:06:30;01:06:33;"but maybe there was a kind of earnest belief"
01:06:33;01:06:36;"that the hatred and the racism could get fixed."
01:06:36;01:06:42;"And '68 was the beginning of the most diabolical pushback."
01:06:42;01:06:43;"And political cynicism."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"And like the biggest bullsh*t--"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Yeah, that's-- 'cause that's--"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"'Cause back before '68--"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"I'm just painting really broad strokes, and I might be wrong,"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"but I'm saying like, back in the '50s,"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"there was an obvious enemy, right?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"Yeah."
01:06:56;01:07:00;"Just like straight-up racist, sexist maniacs."
01:07:00;01:07:03;"And then in '68, yeah, you have this weird, cynical flip,"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"where it's like, ""Oh, we're not racist. We're not sexist."""
01:07:06;01:07:07;"We're the silent majority."
01:07:08;01:07:11;"No, no, no, we just believe in family values."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"We have nothing against black people."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"We're just fighting drugs."
01:07:15;01:07:16;"You know, like-- Yeah."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Like the Nixon strategy was to do things"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"that disproportionately affected non-white people,"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"but kind of do it--"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"Yeah, it was really like the beginning of a weird, cynical time."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"So I think when we hear Peter Cetera singing that song,"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"it's-- we sense that he's out of step"
01:07:31;01:07:34;"with the feeling of his era."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Right, just picture '86, like-- Yeah."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"All the kind of insane things that were happening under Reagan,"
01:07:39;01:07:42;"just like, yeah, the drug war."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"AIDS, Iran-Contra, all that stuff."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Crumbling infrastructure, and then just the dude,"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"""I am the man who will fight for your honor."""
01:07:50;01:07:53;"Although-- It's a perfect song for the Reagan era."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"Right. Reagan's optimism is like,"
01:07:55;01:07:57;"""It's morning in America. It's all good."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"We're gonna take it back to the '50s."""
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Even the name ""Glory of Love,"" it's like glory."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"It's like, ""Slow your roll, dude."""
01:08:05;01:08:08;"Yeah. The number one-- now, this one's interesting."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Okay."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"Because the number one song of summer '86"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"actually kind of holds up,"
01:08:13;01:08:17;"'cause it was pushing back a little bit on cultural norms."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"This was an artist who's still doing her thing today."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"So in 1986, this was a song that--"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"The Peter Cetera feels like so dated."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"He was singing about the glory of love,"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"whereas some-- she was kind of singing the opposite."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"[playing ""Glory of Love""]"
01:08:33;01:08:43;"I don't know about this intro. I forgot about it."
01:08:43;01:08:49;"Does this pop up in ""Preach""?"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"This music's very '80s."
01:08:51;01:08:57;"[imitates bass]"
01:08:57;01:09:00;"Is someone playing that bass?"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Sounds like a keyboard."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"# But I know you're going to be upset #"
01:09:06;01:09:10;"# 'Cause I was always your little girl #"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"# Too sure of nobody now #"
01:09:13;01:09:16;"# I'm not a baby #"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"# You always taught me right from wrong #"
01:09:21;01:09:25;"# I need your help, daddy, please be strong #"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"# I may be young at heart #"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"# But I know what I'm saying #"
01:09:31;01:09:37;"# The one you warned me all about #"
01:09:37;01:09:41;"# The one you said I could do without #"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"# We're in an awful mess #"
01:09:44;01:09:48;"# And I don't need baby, please #"
01:09:48;01:09:52;"# Papa, don't preach, I've been told #"
01:09:52;01:09:56;"# Papa, don't preach, I've been over the street #"
01:09:56;01:09:59;"# But I made up my mind #"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"# I'm keeping my baby #"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"- Okay, wait a sec. - She's keeping her baby."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Is the baby-- is she pregnant,"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"or she's talking about, like, her baby that--"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"- She's pregnant. - Okay, all right."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Wow. So, okay."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Just--wow."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"So basically everything that we're saying about, like,"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"what's corny about the Peter Cetera song,"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"just, like, 1986,"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"kind of just, like, head in the sand vibe,"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"just, like, having these trite--"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"I mean, it is a great song. I really hate to diss Peter Cetera."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"He's a legend. But, you know, just on a cultural level,"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"this, like, song-- it kind of feels funny."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Like, 1986, America's falling apart."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"You got this, like, gnarly president"
01:10:36;01:10:39;"who's kind of preaching one thing"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"and then literally, like, supporting death squads"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"in Latin America."
01:10:43;01:10:46;"Like, you know, Reagan was up to some real gnarly stuff."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"So Peter Cetera is singing these very trite sentiments"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"about glory, living forever."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"And Madonna's basically saying,"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"""I've got a real problem here."""
01:10:55;01:10:57;"- She's a realist. - Yeah, she's a realist."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Like, and shout-out to Madonna, because, like, people kind of--"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"I feel like there's more and more Madonna hate these days,"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"but she really did her thing."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"So Madonna's saying, like, ""Hey, guys,"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"""I'm not interested in these giant narratives"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"about eternal love or whatever."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"I got a real problem. I'm pregnant."
01:11:11;01:11:14;"It's with a guy I love, and guess what, father figure?"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"I know you didn't like him, but guess what?"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"He's here, and he impregnated your daughter."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"So can you just, like, shut the f--- up for a second and help me?"""
01:11:21;01:11:23;"- Get on board, dog. - Get on board."
01:11:23;01:11:26;"This is happening. We're in the real world."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"Hey, Dad, I believe in the video her dad was played by Danny Aiello."
01:11:29;01:11:32;"I was picturing Danny Aiello, and I was--"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"in my head, I was like, ""Is this from a movie, or what?"""
01:11:34;01:11:37;"Or am I just a closet Danny Aiello head?"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"So it's basically like, ""Hey, Mr. Aiello,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"you know, I wish I could have had a white wedding."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"I wish that I could have, um, have eternal love"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"with somebody that you love, but guess what?"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"- Things are messed up."" - Life's messy."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Life's messy, and we just gotta make the best of it."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"So actually, I really like that after our kind of dark"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"- interpretation of ""Summer '86""... - Yeah."
01:11:57;01:12:00;"...that I'm glad that the number one song"
01:12:00;01:12:04;"is kind of, like, pushing back against a conservative father figure."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"- How about that? How about that? - She was the postmodern realist."
01:12:07;01:12:11;"Yeah, you literally have this, like, conservative father figure"
01:12:11;01:12:15;"lying to the country, Reagan, supporting death squads,"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"flooding the hood with crack, and that's not a conspiracy theory."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"- That's real. - And you have a rock star from the '70s"
01:12:22;01:12:27;"in his later years writing power ballads for a Hollywood sequel."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"- Yeah. - No wonder Madonna set the world on fire."
01:12:30;01:12:34;"""Papa Don't Preach."" That's what this show's all about, man."
01:12:34;01:12:37;"It's when we find those moments when the charts"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"reflected the will of the people."
01:12:39;01:12:42;"That Madonna song sounded great. I haven't heard that in years."
01:12:42;01:12:45;"I was, like, captivated by that song."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"- And you're really, like, following the story. - Yeah."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"I'm not, like, a ride-or-die Madonna person at all."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- Absolutely not. - Like, she's got a lot of great songs,"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"but it's like, ""Man, I like that."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"""1986, 'Papa Don't Preach,' number one."""
01:12:58;01:13:00;"- Is that the true Blue album? - Yeah."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"So that has ""Open Your Heart."""
01:13:02;01:13:04;"That has, like, a lot of huge hits on there."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Massive. She was killing it."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"Shout-out to you, Madonna, 1986."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"So we just went through-- we kind of went back in time four decades."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"- Three decades. - Yeah. Yeah, man."
01:13:14;01:13:16;"- Three years here. - Yeah."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Three to four decades."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"Yeah, you're right. 2006, '96, '86."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"I gotta say, maybe it's natural."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"You go back ten years, and you're kind of like,"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"""Oh, wait, this is ten years ago. Weird."""
01:13:28;01:13:31;"You go back 20 years-- go back 30 years."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"That's when you really, like, find the story."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Hindsight's 20/20, what can I say?"
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:13:37;01:13:41;"So speaking of 1986, that was a big year for rap."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"An early, massive hip-hop album,"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"the debut album by the Beastie Boys came out in 1986."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"- I don't want to play a song from that. - Not debut, bro."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- Yeah. - Really?"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"- Yeah, man. - I thought Paul's Boutique-- wait."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"Okay, my bad. Skip that segment."
01:13:57;01:14:01;"No shocker that I'm not a aficionado on hip-hop history."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"So one member of this group, the Beastie Boys,"
01:14:03;01:14:08;"Mike D just started doing his own show, Echo Chamber, on Beats 1."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"I was on his first show on Friday,"
01:14:10;01:14:15;"and took a little bit of our conversation back to time crisis."
01:14:15;01:14:18;"So we're gonna listen to the Beastie Boys,"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"and then you'll hear some of my conversation"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"with the legend, Mike D."
01:14:22;01:14:25;"# It's time to get ill"
01:14:25;01:14:36;"# I'm not the type of person like to waste my time"
01:14:36;01:14:39;"# I'm ready to morn 'em, I can just say my rhymes"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"# And I got all the checkers in the room"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"# Taking tens of meters away"

01:14:45;01:14:48;"# From class I was ejected, just beat my D in SCA"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"# I got all the time that I need to kill"

01:14:54;01:15:05;"# You've been fully captivated by the funky-ass bass"

01:15:10;01:15:12;"# Cool chillin' in the spotlight"

01:15:15;01:15:18;"# But I'm chillin' with the medicals, cool it out, bye"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"# I can drink a quarter monkey and still stand still"

01:15:35;01:15:37;"# D"
01:15:37;01:15:40;"# When I saw my house, I went down to the gully"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"# I spent my lifetime to refuel my fat battery"

01:15:44;01:15:47;"# I got more rhymes than Phyllis Tiller"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"# Yeah, he take his hands, made an income man"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"# Whole body turn it up, don't give a damn"
01:15:51;01:15:54;"# Man, my name's MCL, got a licence to kill"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"# And what's the time? It's time to get ill"
01:15:57;01:16:00;"# I'm Mr Red"

01:16:19;01:16:22;"# Today I feel like killing just as chill as I can"

01:21:11;01:21:13;"Like if Phil Collins were to come back right now?"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Yeah, yeah."
01:21:14;01:21:17;"Can we talk to him about a co-write situation?"
01:21:17;01:21:20;"I have a lot of feelings about Phil Collins, but it's too deep."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"Do you know..."
01:21:21;01:21:25;"Well, you know, that was one of my favorite interviews of all time."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Somehow, I ran away."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"I was watching MTV, and I forget who it was,"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"and Bones Thugs was talking about Phil Collins."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"Oh, they did a song with him."
01:21:33;01:21:37;"Yeah, they did a song, and he was like, ""Well, you know, Phil Collins is a genius."""
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Yeah."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"No, Phil Collins--"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"And that's always stuck with me."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"The main thing--"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"One thing people need to know about Phil Collins,"
01:21:44;01:21:48;"and hopefully it'll help all of us be better people,"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"is that I read-- there was this interview a few years ago in Rolling Stone"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"where they were interviewing him in his mansion in Switzerland."
01:21:55;01:21:58;"I always bring this up. It's one of my favorite interviews."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"So he's out there in Switzerland."
01:21:59;01:22:02;"He's really into collecting Civil War stuff."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"American Civil War stuff?"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"Yeah, it's one of his main passions."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"He'll roll up to some weird Civil War--"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"That kind of scares and repels me at the same time."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"I'm just going to say."
01:22:11;01:22:14;"I assume it's not for weird racist reasons,"
01:22:14;01:22:19;"but the main point of the story is that they're interviewing him,"
01:22:19;01:22:21;"and they're like, ""So when are you going to go back on the road?"""
01:22:21;01:22:24;"He also, I guess, has back problems, and he's like, ""Ugh."""
01:22:24;01:22:26;"He was just really bitter, and he was like, ""Nobody likes me anyway."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"I'm just a joke, right?"""
01:22:27;01:22:30;"And then you realize this dude who sold hundreds of millions of records,"
01:22:30;01:22:33;"he was kind of like the butt of a lot of people's jokes."
01:22:33;01:22:37;"For super cool people, Phil Collins was a joke."
01:22:37;01:22:41;"Well, yeah, but that's how he kind of positioned himself in his videos and stuff."
01:22:41;01:22:46;"There was always a degree of self-deprecation with the Phil Collins image."
01:22:46;01:22:47;"He probably thought that he was--"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"It's not like he didn't come out like Fat Joe."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Yeah, no, he wasn't like, ""Phil Collins--"""
01:22:51;01:22:54;"I'm going to say right there, that could be a very viable duet."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"I want to, along with our--"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Fat Joe and Phil Collins?"
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Yeah."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"I want to do a proposing with Phil Collins."
01:22:59;01:23:03;"I think then we also get a Fat Joe-Phil Collins duet on the album."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"It could be amazing."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Talk about all the way up."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"But a lot of people hated on Phil Collins,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"and I think it really hurt his self-esteem,"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"and now Phil Collins is cool again."
01:23:12;01:23:13;"What do you mean?"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"He had the biggest songs ever, the 808 one with the--"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Yeah, but you--"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"Is it called ""The Night"" or whatever?"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"""In the Air Tonight"" or whatever."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"""In the Air Tonight."""
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Yeah, that's one of the biggest records."
01:23:24;01:23:27;"I know he basically invented a whole new drum sound."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"I think you just got to remember that he came out of Genesis,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"playing on Brian Eno Records,"
01:23:32;01:23:38;"and it probably really hurt him that the cool, critical establishment"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"made fun of him so much."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"So, you know."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"You've obviously put some thought into this,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"and you have a lot of compassion."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"When we're out there--"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"So this is why we-- all the more reason."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"We do this co-write situation with him,"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"which he's not asking for, by the way,"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"and probably has no interest in."
01:23:54;01:23:57;"Well, as long as he knows that, Phil, we know that you're dope."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"We support you."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"That's what I'm saying."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"We do the co-write with him."
01:24:00;01:24:01;"He comes out."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"Then we get the duet with Fat Joe."
01:24:04;01:24:06;"Where's his esteem now?"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"It's going to be like--"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"I mean, Phil Collins survived."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"Look at me now."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"I'm getting paper."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Love you, Phil."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"The same."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Can you pick one Phil Collins song?"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"Now, is it cheating if I look at my phone?"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"I don't go that deep with Phil."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"Phil, I don't want you to take this wrong."
01:24:26;01:24:30;"I'm not as big a fan as ""Bones Thugs."""
01:24:30;01:24:32;"Can I play the ""Bones Thugs"" Phil Collins duet?"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Which I don't even remember--"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"It was a sampling of ""Please Take Me Home."""
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Yeah."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"Yeah, let's listen to that."
01:24:40;01:24:41;"That's a great choice."
01:24:41;01:24:44;"All right, I'm going ""Bones Thugs"" Phil Collins for sure."
01:24:44;01:24:45;"""Bones Thugs"" and Phil."
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Let's do it."

01:28:39;01:28:41;"'Cause I don't need no home"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"When I was young, but y'all were part of me when wrong"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"It didn't happen when the bone was coming up so strong"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"I see what we do, you motivated us at the shows we see too"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"And I really hope they miss what we spit on these songs"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"You might have been through some, but hope it's nothing like home"
01:28:52;01:28:56;"Like once, and we never make it, like two thirty million next faces"
01:28:56;01:28:59;"And I really thought it was over, put us on the left, crossed over"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Back to the hood, we soldier"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"The music didn't make it back, scandalous"
01:29:03;01:29:06;"But faith kicked in, and the world shows, and we winning now"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"Gotta keep it coming, food in my baby's mouth"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"And things have changed, like relationships"

01:29:12;01:29:15;"Suing me for things you would never made on your own"
01:29:15;01:29:18;"Now I'm on the stairwalk up, need a little vibe, bigger home"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Stick in the hood, met some scrubs, and I won't be gone"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"You can't really help a thug if it ain't meant to be"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"With a little ooey, with a little ooey"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"I'm tired of trying to help these thugs"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"Lord, just guide 'em home, guide 'em home"
01:29:28;01:29:36;"So take me home"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"'Cause I don't need no home"
01:29:38;01:29:42;"Take me home"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"Oh no"
01:29:44;01:29:52;"Take me home"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"'Cause I don't need no home"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"That was a pick from Mike D"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Bone Thugs-n-Harmony featuring Phil Collins"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"""Take Me Home"""
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Great sample"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Closing track on ""No Jacket Required"""
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Oh, the original?"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Yeah, ""Home"""
01:30:08;01:30:10;"That's the one where he has the orange face"
01:30:10;01:30:14;"Bone Thugs, they brought Phil back hard into the 90s"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Totally"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Very cool"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Alright, we've been digging in the crates a lot in this episode"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Learning about the summer hits of years past"
01:30:22;01:30:28;"But that was all in preparation for the Top 5"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"It's time for the Top 5"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Five"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"On iTunes"
01:30:34;01:30:40;"So, as we did on the last proper episode of Time Crisis"
01:30:40;01:30:46;"We've been comparing the Top 5 hits of our era, summer 2016"
01:30:46;01:30:52;"With what was going on back in another tumultuous era, 1968"
01:30:52;01:30:54;"Obviously 2016 and 1968 have been compared a lot"
01:30:54;01:31:00;"Political unrest, racism, brutality, election years"
01:31:00;01:31:04;"We've got the conventions coming up"
01:31:04;01:31:08;"Hopefully nothing as violent as what happened in 1968 happens"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"But obviously, people are angry"
01:31:10;01:31:16;"So we're going to start out with the number 5 song of this moment in 1968"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"And we're going to compare it to 2016"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"See if we can learn anything"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Because you know what they say about history"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"It repeats itself"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"I don't know if they say that"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"But they say if you don't take a good hard look at it"
01:31:28;01:31:30;"You're doomed to repeat it"
01:31:30;01:31:34;"Although truthfully, you're doomed to repeat it no matter what"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"The more things change"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Exactly"
01:31:38;01:31:42;"The number 5 song in 1968 was by Hugh Masekela"
01:31:42;01:31:46;"Who I believe at that time was in exile from apartheid South Africa"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"He's a black man from South Africa"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"So this is the height of apartheid"
01:31:50;01:31:54;"Or, you know, 1960s South Africa"
01:31:54;01:31:58;"The black people having extremely limited rights"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Being brutalized"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"So he and a lot of other South African musicians"
01:32:02;01:32:04;"Got out of there to kind of like live their life"
01:32:04;01:32:08;"And he made this song, an instrumental that became an international hit"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"""Grazing in the Grass"""
01:32:10;01:32:14;"Oh yeah"
01:32:14;01:32:20;"Not a lot of like just mellow instrumental hits anymore"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"(whistling)"
01:32:22;01:32:26;"Interesting how that cowbell"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"It drops in and out"
01:32:28;01:32:42;"This is totally like"
01:32:42;01:32:46;"The Scorsese thing we did two weeks ago"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"1968, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"(whistling)"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"It's a feel good song"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Yeah, very summery"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"Very summery, it was kind of a brutal summer"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"But you know, I can imagine like everybody"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Conservative people, liberal people"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Everybody was probably okay with that song"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"Feel good, nice music"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"(saxophone solo)"
01:33:18;01:33:38;"The number five song in the present day"
01:33:38;01:33:40;"Back to our point on the timeline"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Is Meghan Trainor, ""Me Too"""
01:33:42;01:33:44;"I don't know this one"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"She was on, we've heard a lot of Meghan Trainor"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"A month or two ago, right?"
01:33:48;01:33:54;"Makes you want to move"
01:33:54;01:34:00;"Throw a cowbell in there"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"(imitating cowbell)"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"Okay, this is an empowerment song"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"As many Meghan Trainor songs are"
01:34:16;01:34:24;"Oh, this has throwback drums"
01:34:24;01:34:28;"Ooh, yeah, she always has that"
01:34:28;01:34:32;"(imitating drum solo)"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"What you doing here?"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"What you doing like a"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"You got to be a big shot"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"When I heard the beginning of that song"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"I was like, oh nice, this is a song about appreciating yourself"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"Finding yourself sexy"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"That's important"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"If you spend too much time hating the way you look"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"That's a lot of energy you could put into other things"
01:34:58;01:35:02;"You know, it's a tough world, it's hard to feel confident"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"About the way you look in 2016"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"I like the message"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"But then the chorus comes"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"Tell me if I'm interpreting this incorrectly"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"It kind of sounds like she's saying"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"I found self-fulfillment"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"In my own sexiness"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"I look in the mirror now and I see somebody who's sexy"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"But then she flips and says"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"And now that I've got self-fulfillment"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"I want to use that as a cudgel"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"To destroy your self-esteem"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"If I was you, I'd want to be me too"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"Is that cool?"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"That is weird"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Now you know I'm a massive Meghan Trainor fan"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"So I gotta check these lyrics"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"If I were you"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"The first verse says"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"Who's that sexy thing I see over there?"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"That's me standing in the mirror"
01:35:44;01:35:46;"Great, I love that"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"What's that icy thing hanging around my neck?"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"That's gold, show some respect"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"I also agree that the amount of gold you have"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Should determine your self-worth"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"And then the next stanza"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"I thank God every day"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"You know, I like that"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"Praise to the most high"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"That I woke up feeling this way"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"And I don't need nobody else"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"I like that, so far so good, right?"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"All very hollow affirmations"
01:36:10;01:36:12;"Okay man"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"I knew you were gonna come in with that negativity"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"But so far I like it"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"It's about, you find yourself sexy"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"She praised the two most important things in life"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"Gold and God"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"And she says I don't need anybody else"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"You can't control in your life when you're gonna be alone"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"So you have to be okay with it"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"You have to be okay with being alone"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"But then the chorus is"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"If I was you I'd wanna be me too"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"See this is bananas, this is why 2016 is so nutty"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"It basically is like"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"You know what, I've worked really hard on"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"Improving myself and getting"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"Right with God and"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"Having a deeper understanding"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"Of basic human emotion"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"And you know, blah blah blah"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"And that's why I'm better than you"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Yeah it crosses a line from"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"Self-affirmation"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"To egomania"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"It's a thin line man"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Straight up, I think that's a very"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"2016 problem so"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"You know what, I prefer 1968"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"For the number 5 song because"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"It had no words"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"I feel like it's unintentionally reflecting"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"The collective consciousness"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"Yeah I don't know, I mean Megan, you got my number"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"If you think we're misinterpreting it, please hit me up"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"But I do think that's definitely like a sign"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Of the times, I think about this all the time"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"You know I've been"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Interested in Buddhism my whole life"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"It's well known in the community"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"But you know, I've like, whatever"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"Studied it, been around it"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"And there was this book I had when I was a kid"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"That my mom gave me that was these little"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Cartoons about Zen Buddhism"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"It was always interesting to me because"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"It was these kind of strange stories explaining"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"How different monks became"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"Enlightened, you know"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"If it was easy to become enlightened, we'd all just get"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Enlightened, so it's like these very difficult"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"To understand stories about how"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"A certain, something that somebody said"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Or a certain unusual circumstance"
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Finally achieved enlightenment"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"So my whole life, because these cartoons made a big impression"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"On me, I always kind of wondered"
01:38:02;01:38:04;"When will I be enlightened? Is it going to happen for me?"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"I don't know"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"And then so then there's times in my life where I really start"
01:38:08;01:38:10;"To try to understand"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"The teachings of Buddhism or you know"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"All religions really, they're all kind of saying the same thing"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"And"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"So I'm wondering, how will I know when I achieved"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"Enlightenment, when I truly became"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Ascended to this level of understanding"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"And compassion"
01:38:24;01:38:26;"And the funny thing is like"
01:38:26;01:38:28;"There are times where you kind of embrace these philosophies"
01:38:28;01:38:30;"And you think, well"
01:38:30;01:38:32;"Maybe I'm finally enlightened"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"Often times the first thing you think is"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"And you know what? I'm definitely a lot more"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Enlightened than that dip- I rule"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"I rule, it's like just when you think"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"That you cracked the code, man"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"When you're kind of like, it's kind of like"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"You know, these days everybody talks about"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"Like being woke, and it's very important"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"To kind of understand"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"The hatred and the racism and the sexism"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"That drives our world"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"And sometimes you start reading"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"About these things and you feel like you finally"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"Understand it, and if"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"Your first impulse is to"
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Use that as like a tool"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"Of ego"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"To compare yourself"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"You've only learned part of the lesson"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"I mean it's something we all have to work on but"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"I'm not saying it's easy so I'm not trying to"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"Diss Meghan Trainor, this song just presents"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"An unusually stark"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"Example"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"Of basically being like, I've worked very hard"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"To accept myself"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"And to understand that there's more to life"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Than other people's standards"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"Of beauty, great"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"Therefore I'm better than you"
01:39:32;01:39:34;"If I was you, you pathetic piece of"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"I'd want to be me too, it's amazing"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"It's such a- you know what, I don't know if it's just a"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"2016 thing, that's just life"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"It shows that she's still suffering"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"That's true, I guess the Buddhist point of view would be like"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Yeah, you're still suffering from the"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Prison of the ego"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"Desire is the cause of"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Suffering"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"Desire is the root of all suffering"
01:39:54;01:39:56;"And then it's like even now"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"I guess we're kind of saying in a way that we have a deeper"
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Understanding than Meghan Trainor"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Of her own work"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Of her own work, and what is that?"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"That's our desire, that's our ego"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"We're suffering too"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"Are we being compassionate to Meghan Trainor?"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"That's a question, that's why a lot of times"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"I just keep my mouth shut when I see people"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"Like when you're on Twitter"
01:40:16;01:40:18;"You think you see somebody else"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Saying something very egotistical"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"And then you get up there"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"Being like, how pathetic"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"Is this guy who's ruled by his ego"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"And what are you doing man?"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"That is a crazy cycle"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"It's a crazy cycle, I just deleted a tweet"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Because I was kind of like clowning on this"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Dude who wrote something I thought very"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Silly on Twitter, and then I just deleted"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"It because I was like, am I better?"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"I don't know"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Anyway, I think we should thank Meghan Trainor for"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"Provoking this conversation, let's get back to 1968"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"The number 4 song was Gary Puckett"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"And the Union Gap"

01:40:52;01:40:54;"Lady"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"What is this? I've never heard this song"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"Is it like a feminist song?"

01:41:00;01:41:02;"It's now or never"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"Give your love to me"

01:41:18;01:41:20;"I know"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"You want to see me"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"But you're"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Afraid"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Of what I"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Might have on my"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Mind"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"Classic Gary Puckett here"

01:41:56;01:41:58;"Yeah"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"What is the willpower?"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"He's saying she has too much willpower to not have sex with him"

01:42:04;01:42:06;"Lady willpower"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Classic creepy"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"Yeah, this is the second Gary Puckett song"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"That we've had this year"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"He was killing it in the 60's"

01:42:36;01:42:38;"You have to learn"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"The number four song"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"A very controversial song at the moment"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"Calvin Harris"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"With Rihanna"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Why is this controversial?"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"Taylor Swift said she wrote it"

01:47:51;01:47:53;"I mean, one thing I'll say is that"
01:47:53;01:47:58;"21 Pilots have an unusual lyrical perspective"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"that you're not seeing a lot in the top five."
01:48:00;01:48:01;"There's been a lot of great music,"
01:48:01;01:48:04;"but it's very classic, straightforward pop."
01:48:04;01:48:07;"Not a lot of what you might call poetic nuance."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"And I'm not saying one's better than the other,"
01:48:09;01:48:11;"but it's like, this song, it's like, okay."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"This song, if you're a 21 Pilots fan,"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"you could definitely spend some time"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"parsing through the lyrics."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"It's unusual for the top five."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"- Yeah."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"- So I'll say shout out to 21 Pilots"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"for bringing a little different flavor into the top five."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Is it as good as ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"""
01:48:26;01:48:27;"by the Rolling Stones?"
01:48:27;01:48:28;"Man, I don't know."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Both rock songs, I guess."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"- Yeah, where is, like,"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"where would I hear that 21 Pilots song?"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"- They're the rare, like, band."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"- Yeah."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"- That's also getting played on pop radio."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"- I don't even have a handle on pop radio."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"It seems like the radio stations"
01:48:43;01:48:47;"have become very segregated."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"- Yes."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"- There's not a lot of that alternative pop crossover"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"like there was in the '90s."
01:48:52;01:48:54;"21 Pilots are changing that, though."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"Shout out to them."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"So let's head back to 1968."
01:48:57;01:49:00;"I should point out to the listeners that"
01:49:00;01:49:04;"I got hungry, so I'm eating some Cool Ranch Doritos."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"I'm offering some to Jake,"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"but you don't seem interested."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"- Can I just chime in, though?"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:49:10;01:49:11;"- It's weirdly serendipitous."
01:49:11;01:49:15;"Doritos were introduced onto the national market in 1968."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"- Really?"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- They were invented in '66."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"They were actually invented at Disneyland,"
01:49:21;01:49:24;"and there was a marketing executive from Frito-Lay."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"I remember this from my Frito-Lay research."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"There was a marketing executive from Frito-Lay"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"that was visiting Disneyland with his family,"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"and there was a restaurant at Disneyland"
01:49:32;01:49:35;"that was making sort of a version of those chips,"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"and he was sort of like, ""Ooh, like a tortilla chip."""
01:49:38;01:49:41;"- But coated in dust."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"- Yeah, dust."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"But anyway, in '66, they start experimenting with Doritos,"
01:49:46;01:49:49;"and then in '68, they were launched nationally."
01:49:49;01:49:51;"- So 1968 wasn't all bad."
01:49:51;01:49:54;"I should point out to everybody at home, like,"
01:49:54;01:49:58;"one of the first rules of radio is you don't eat on air"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"unless you announce it,"
01:50:00;01:50:04;"'cause otherwise people would hear these kind of noises."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Mmm."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"- You're a suburban mom."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"- And be confused."
01:50:08;01:50:12;"- You're getting out of your 1968 station wagon."
01:50:12;01:50:16;"Gary Puckett, Lady Willpower, is blasting on the radio."
01:50:16;01:50:19;"You go in, there's a new item on the end cap"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"of the grocery store--Doritos."
01:50:21;01:50:23;"And you're thinking, ""Lady Willpower?"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"I don't have the willpower. I'm gonna buy those Doritos."""
01:50:25;01:50:26;"- You're probably thinking,"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"""This seems like a healthy snack for my kids."""
01:50:28;01:50:29;"It's 1968."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"You're probably like, ""It says it's a snack."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"It's got a cool name, Doritos."""
01:50:33;01:50:36;"I mean, there's no way that they would mass-market something"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"that wasn't good for you, right?"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"- That's inconceivable. - That's inconceivable."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"- And it's a nice alternative to potato chips."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- Right, potato chips are so greasy."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"This is great. I bet this is healthier."
01:50:47;01:50:50;"- I wonder if healthier was even a consideration."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"- Mmm."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"All right, let's finish the top five."

01:58:36;01:58:38;"so that's a good note to end the show on."
01:58:38;01:58:40;"- About time. - Yeah."
01:58:40;01:58:43;"I mean, it is brutal to me that we came so close"
01:58:43;01:58:46;"to having a socialist candidate"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"who was saying things that truly nobody else said,"
01:58:49;01:58:52;"but I do agree with Bernie"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"that now what's important is putting our resources"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"behind Hillary to beat Trump."
01:58:56;01:58:57;"That's important."
01:58:57;01:59:01;"And, um, we can't let our egos rule us."
01:59:01;01:59:03;"I'm still on that Cool Ranch Doritos high."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"I'm just talking nonsense."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"- Those Doritos were laced with weed."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"- Man, that's a good idea, man."
01:59:09;01:59:12;"- You sound baked right now. - Doritos--weed Doritos?"
01:59:12;01:59:15;"- Matter of time. - This is a weird show."
01:59:15;01:59:18;"I think these new digs are kind of messing with my head."
01:59:18;01:59:21;"- Yeah, this new studio got me trippin',"
01:59:21;01:59:24;"but, um, if I had to summarize this whole show,"
01:59:24;01:59:28;"I would say that it's about choosing kindness"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"and compassion over the ego."
01:59:30;01:59:32;"And it's not always easy to know"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"if you're being ruled by your ego,"
01:59:34;01:59:36;"because sometimes you think,"
01:59:36;01:59:39;"""I'm not being ruled by my ego anymore."
01:59:39;01:59:41;"How dope am I?"""
01:59:41;01:59:43;"And clearly you got some work to do"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"if that's what's going through your head."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"- That's what Meghan Trainor taught us today."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"- Thank you, Meghan, for that lesson."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"I think also another thing that,"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"if I had to summarize the whole show,"
01:59:53;01:59:56;"is that we are all humans, and we do have basic needs."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"Sex is a basic need."
01:59:58;02:00:01;"However you choose to address that need,"
02:00:01;02:00:03;"that's on you."
02:00:03;02:00:05;"And so is food."
02:00:05;02:00:09;"I felt so much better when I ate the Cool Ranch Doritos."
02:00:09;02:00:14;"It brought me a sense of tranquility and peace."
02:00:14;02:00:18;"And you know I have my problems with the Frito-Lay Corporation."
02:00:18;02:00:23;"But on some basic human level, I needed food."
02:00:23;02:00:26;"And the Cool Ranch Doritos hit the spot, man."
02:00:26;02:00:28;"- Politics be damned."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"- Politics be damned. We're human beings,"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"and we need each other."
02:00:32;02:00:36;"We need food, and we need the warmth of human affection."
02:00:36;02:00:39;"So that wraps up another Time Crisis."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Thanks for being here, Jake."
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Everybody listening at home, take care of each other."
02:00:43;02:00:47;"Do what you can do to make sure Donald Trump doesn't become president."
02:00:47;02:00:50;"And keep listening to great music and being kind."
02:00:50;02:00:52;"- Worldwide. - Always on."
