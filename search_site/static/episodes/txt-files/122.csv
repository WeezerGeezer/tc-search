00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis in a time of crisis, united by FaceTime to make this Time Crisis."
00:07;00:14;"On this episode, we talk red hot chili peppers, also Munch's make-believe band."
00:14;00:20;"All that, plus the top 5 hits of 1977 and 2020."
00:20;00:24;"This is a spicy Neapolitan."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:28;00:30;"Let's dig in."
26:25;26:34;"I was thinking about a band that maybe could have taken the mantle from Aerosmith in terms of huge American bands with multi-decade runs."
26:34;26:39;"Chili Peppers. Did anyone bring them up as the greatest American band?"
26:39;26:40;"Yeah."
26:40;26:42;"Did we get an email about Chili Peppers?"
26:42;26:46;"Like about the Chili's being the greatest American band? I mean that's preposterous, but..."
26:46;26:50;"They've sold 80 million albums worldwide. Huge."
26:50;26:51;"I'm not a fan."
26:51;26:54;"[Explosion]"
26:54;26:57;"I love Blood Sugar Sex Magic and I'm out."
26:57;26:59;"Guys, we did get an email about this."
26:59;27:01;"We did get an email, right? What does the email say?"
27:01;27:04;"It's a long one, but I think the key phrase is..."
27:04;27:05;"Yeah, summarize it."
27:05;27:11;"Whether we'd like to admit it or not, RHCP was, for a period, at least the most popular rock band in the world."
27:11;27:15;"Second only to U2. I'll forward it to you."
27:15;27:17;"Second only to U2."
27:17;27:26;"Well, first of all, Jake, that's kind of harsh to say that you are not a fan when you would also say you love one of their albums."
27:26;27:28;"Yeah, Blood Sugar Sex Magic is sick."
27:28;27:32;"I just don't need any more music from them outside of that record."
27:32;27:34;"You just think that was a perfect album?"
27:34;27:36;"I think that's Rick Rubin's finest work."
27:36;27:45;"It is a pretty amazing moment and anybody who hasn't seen it, I highly recommend Funky Monks, which is hard to track down sometimes,"
27:45;27:50;"but that's a black and white documentary about the making of Blood Sugar Sex Magic."
27:50;27:58;"And that's when they're at that mansion in Laurel Canyon and you get Rick in there, Chaz Smith riding his motorcycle."
27:58;28:00;"It is pretty amazing."
28:00;28:07;"This might be a generational thing, Jake, but I find some people really love Californication,"
28:07;28:12;"which came out six or seven years after that."
28:12;28:17;"Because I think for a lot of people, they love Under the Bridge and that kind of RHCP vibe."
28:17;28:20;"And then Californication was almost like an album of that."
28:20;28:22;"Do you remember when you first heard Scar Tissue?"
28:22;28:25;"That's a beautiful song. Would you agree?"
28:25;28:31;"Yeah, no, sure. The Californication period and after is just too slick."
28:31;28:38;"There's no grit. There's no texture to it. It's just very cold and corporate sounding to me."
28:38;28:43;"Blood Sugar, there's a real sense of atmosphere. It's like music from Big Pink or something."
28:43;28:51;"In what sense? Just an American band at the height of their powers hold up in a residential home?"
28:51;28:56;"Yes, a residential recording situation. No, I do love the mythology of that."
28:56;29:04;"But also, that's a crazy sounding album. Breaking the Girl, the production on that, all those acoustics,"
29:04;29:07;"it almost sounds like Rubber Soul or something."
29:07;29:10;"When you look Under the Hood on that album, because for whatever reason,"
29:10;29:17;"when I think of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, I just picture the black and white video for Suck My Kiss."
29:17;29:20;"And I just picture funky rapping, right out Chili Peppers."
29:20;29:25;"Oh, wait, by the way, Seinfeld, real quick, go to Anthony Kiedis' Wikipedia page."
29:25;29:29;"I have a feeling I know what it says. What's his opening line?"
29:29;29:34;"Like Jake is an American painter and radio personality. What's Anthony Kiedis'?"
29:34;29:38;"Anthony Kiedis is an American singer, songwriter and rapper."
29:38;29:43;"Yeah, that's what I thought. I feel like I was on his page a while ago and that just stuck with me."
29:43;29:47;"The first track on Blood Sugar Sex Magic is that song, The Power of Equality."
29:47;29:49;"I mean, he's straight up rapping, right?"
29:49;29:53;"Yeah, he's kind of, or I guess straight up rapping. I haven't heard it in a long time."
29:53;29:57;"But I remember thinking at the time, oh damn, Kiedis is rapping."
29:57;30:02;"Yeah, and I think he raps on some of the early records too. That's a part of what they did."
30:02;30:06;"So yeah, he's an American singer, songwriter and rapper."
30:06;30:09;"Also author. He wrote a great memoir."
30:09;30:12;"But I know what you mean. Because when I think of that record, what I was starting to say is that"
30:12;30:16;"I think of Suck My Kiss, just like funky, pow, pow."
30:16;30:22;"And just him rapping and just like that kind of, you know, basically bass, guitar, drums, vocals."
30:22;30:26;"You know, that kind of stuff. But then when you look under the hood on some of those songs,"
30:26;30:31;"Breaking the Girl and Under the Bridge, like Under the Bridge at the end, a choir comes in"
30:31;30:37;"and they're like banging on like oil cans or something. It's not like a simple minimalist album"
30:37;30:41;"where every song is just like, you know, a killer three piece plus vocals."
30:41;30:45;"There are these like really interesting moments that kind of give that album color"
30:45;30:48;"and tie it into the classic rock tradition."
30:48;30:52;"In terms of like nasty American rock bands, Aerosmith and Chili Peppers."
30:52;30:57;"I don't think it's fair to put them together. I don't think that's fair."
30:57;30:59;"What's your definition of nasty?"
30:59;31:04;"Just like kind of nasty, like funk and like blues. It's just like..."
31:04;31:07;"But you mean nasty in a negative way?"
31:07;31:11;"Not like Flea and Chad, you guys were so locked in tonight. It was nasty."
31:11;31:15;"Thanks Jake, I really appreciate that."
31:15;31:20;"I kind of mean it in both ways. I mean, obviously like, yeah, they're nasty in that sense"
31:20;31:24;"that they're like completely crushing it. Absolutely sick groove."
31:24;31:31;"But the grooves are nasty, like in a subjective aesthetic sense that I think is gross."
31:31;31:37;"And also, yeah, if I follow your logic, when you talk about the dead,"
31:37;31:42;"the dead is not nasty in either way. It's like even an amazing moment with the dead,"
31:42;31:48;"just like Jerry just doing like a lightning fast riff or everybody's really locked in."
31:48;31:53;"It's still not like a white boy stank face moment. It's still not, ""Oh!"""
31:53;31:59;"It's like the light touch of like a Kreutzmann or a Garcia is never like, ""Oh yeah!"""
31:59;32:01;"Like it's never that kind of nasty."
32:01;32:04;"It's never House of Blues. It's never a Guitar Center. It's never House of Blues."
32:04;32:08;"Nastiness is not necessarily negative, but it is..."
32:08;32:11;"I could see the way your taste leans away from it."
32:11;32:17;"And I guess also there's something like, there's something just like more sexual about those bands"
32:17;32:21;"in like not exactly a cool way."
32:21;32:23;"You know what I mean?"
32:23;32:25;"No, absolutely, dude."
32:25;32:30;"Just like some like Howard Stern, like obviously there's plenty of good sexy music."
32:30;32:35;"It's a part of human life, but there's something like, yeah, there's like Howard Stern nasty."
32:35;32:39;"Just like, ""Ugh!"" Like, ""Yeah!"""
32:39;32:44;"80s Stern sensibility."
32:44;32:47;"80s Stern meets Guitar Center."
32:47;32:50;"It's rough. It's rough stuff."
32:50;32:52;"Big overlap."
32:52;32:55;"That could be a later Mountain Bruise EP."
32:55;33:01;"Jake's mood board is a picture of 80s Howard Stern and a picture of Guitar Center."
33:01;33:07;"Have you guys heard Out in L.A., Red Hot Chili Peppers' first track that featured Anthony Kiedis rapping?"
33:07;33:10;"That's 80s? Is that like from Freaky Stylie or something?"
33:10;33:14;"Yeah, I think it was when the band was called Defunct."
33:14;33:18;"I threw on their first record about five years ago, and it was unlistenable."
33:19;33:22;"This sounds like the Talking Heads."
33:22;33:24;"Yeah."
33:49;33:51;"[coughing]"
33:55;33:57;"Okay."
33:57;33:59;"Kiedis got better."
33:59;34:01;"It's like a Graymaster Flash kind of cadence."
34:01;34:06;"Yeah, it reminds me of, ""Have you ever gone over to a friend's house to eat and the chicken just ate no good?"""
34:06;34:10;"I guess to be fair, you got to give them props too for even like,"
34:10;34:14;"when you consider that you had like the David Crosby's of the world and the Old Heads,"
34:14;34:20;"even George Harrison, I'm sad to report, I saw that recently, in the 80s just being like, ""Rap is not music."""
34:20;34:22;"Actually, that's maybe worth telling the story."
34:22;34:28;"I saw somebody posted this like old clip, like a newspaper clipping from the New York Post that was,"
34:28;34:30;"must have been the late 80s."
34:30;34:36;"And basically, they had a little news item about how George Harrison did an interview where somebody was like,"
34:36;34:40;"""What do you think about this, you know, the emerging form of hip-hop?"""
34:40;34:45;"And George Harrison was just like, ""I'm sorry, but it all sucks, man. You know?"
34:45;34:47;"Yeah, it's really not good. It's not music, man."""
34:47;34:54;"Or whatever, he made a derogatory comment about hip-hop, which most of the Old Heads were doing, sad to report, at the time."
34:54;35:01;"And then some journalist, I guess, went up to Chuck D, and this is in the early days, you know,"
35:01;35:08;"of like public enemy becoming this huge rap group, and I guess mentioned it to him or asked him what he thought."
35:08;35:13;"And then Chuck D just like, with a withering response, just said back, ""Who would you say it was, Harrison?"""
35:13;35:16;"""All right, well, you know, he's third string."""
35:16;35:21;"""If it was Lennon or McCartney, I might have to pause and think about it for a second, but Harrison, get the f*** out of here."""
35:21;35:28;"Which, a lot of people now, it's like cool to say Harrison's your favorite Beatle, but you have to respect that."
35:28;35:29;"That's hilarious."
35:29;35:33;"Harrison making like a pretty just kind of like uneducated comment about hip-hop."
35:33;35:36;"Just like, ""It all sucks."" And so he clearly wasn't giving it the time of day."
35:36;35:40;"Then you ask Chuck D, and Chuck D like knows his Beatles well enough to be like,"
35:40;35:44;"""Well, you know, Harrison's got a couple songs, but he's really not a top tier Beatle."
35:44;35:47;"Always going to be in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney."" You just like hit him where it hurt."
35:47;35:48;"And you're like, ""Fair play."""
35:48;35:49;"I love it."
35:49;35:55;"But anyway, that's all to say that like, even if it sounds a little awkward now, I do kind of respect Chili Pepper,"
35:55;36:03;"young Chili Peppers, 80s LA just being like, ""We love funk music, Led Zeppelin, hip-hop, and the Lakers."""
36:03;36:08;"It's like a real enthusiasm. It doesn't seem like, you know, some like..."
36:08;36:10;"No, it's not super calculated."
36:10;36:13;"Yeah, so you've got to love it. And also, I would also make the case that"
36:13;36:19;"people who hate on the Chili Peppers, it's often... I've seen it so many times, and it bothers me."
36:19;36:23;"I don't like it. When you see somebody make fun of the Chili Peppers, and the first thing they go is like,"
36:23;36:26;"""A bit of butter, but like, a bang, bing, a dang, wing, a ding."""
36:26;36:32;"They like pick up on... There's like a handful of Kiedis lyrical moments where he gets into his like,"
36:32;36:36;"""Wing-a-ding-dang"" type thing. And people love to make fun of that."
36:36;36:40;"And so sometimes I've seen people be like, ""Oh man, I mean like, listen, they got a few songs,"
36:40;36:45;"""Under the Bridge, whatever, but you know, the wing-a-ding-dang-a-dang, California Mop."""
36:45;36:48;"And also like, they make fun of him talking about California so much."
36:48;36:52;"But there's a part of me that's like, ""You know what? I mean, this goes back to the"
36:52;36:57;"""Everything dope has a touch of cringe, every silver lining has a chunk of dunk."""
36:57;37:02;"I'm kind of like, the fact that Kiedis can just get into his wing-a-ding-ding stuff,"
37:02;37:09;"and then also write these truly beautiful ballads about like, vulnerability and stuff."
37:09;37:12;"I'm like, that contrast makes me like them even more."
37:12;37:18;"I appreciate ""Under the Bridge"" more because it's on the same album as ""Suck My Kiss,"" for instance."
37:18;37:23;"You keep bringing up ""Suck My Kiss."" I think it's my favorite of like, the nasty Chili's like, funk songs."
37:23;37:30;"""When I'm sailing."" But yeah, I do feel you on the like... Yeah, without the ballads,"
37:30;37:35;"""Aerosmith"" to me is nothing, and Chili's to me are nothing."
37:35;37:39;"[laughter]"
37:39;37:43;"Anthony, listen to me. Without the ballads, you are nothing."
37:43;37:49;"You are absolutely nothing to me. You are garbage and trash with the ballads."
37:49;37:51;"However, you are something."
37:51;37:56;"They're sublime, Anthony. I'm like a curator. I'm a German curator."
37:56;38:02;"Anthony, your ballads. Kiedis definitely like, developed his own completely idiosyncratic vocal style,"
38:02;38:06;"much like Steve and Tyler, which is why I thought of the Chili's."
38:06;38:10;"To me, there's a Kiedis-Tyler through line."
38:10;38:15;"They're different generations, but they are very similar in their vibe."
38:15;38:20;"They've got deep souls, as is evidenced by the lyrics they wrote for their ballads."
38:20;38:24;"But they also got a streak of nasty that not everybody has."
38:24;38:27;"They're not bashful about their sexuality."
38:27;38:29;"[laughter]"
38:29;38:35;"Yeah, we just think back to the Chili Peppers just wearing socks on their d***s."
38:35;38:36;"Oh my God."
38:36;38:37;"And their light bulb heads."
38:37;38:38;"That was crazy."
38:38;38:42;"They are such an iconic mix of depth and goofiness."
38:42;38:45;"They are actually a very fascinating American band."
38:45;38:49;"I think whoever wrote that email deserves props."
38:49;38:51;"But again, it gets back to the same thing."
38:51;38:55;"Every American band you could think of, there's always this caveat where you're like,"
38:55;39:00;"you can just picture the person in the conversation just laughing it out of the room."
39:00;39:06;"Just be like, you know, you picture you're at Hank Azaria's poker night."
39:06;39:11;"And people are like, ""Alright, who's the American band that can go toe-to-toe"
39:11;39:13;"with the Stones, Led Zeppelin, whoever?"""
39:13;39:15;"And you're just like, ""RHCP."""
39:15;39:17;"Yeah, it doesn't track."
39:17;39:19;"That's just America, isn't it?"
39:19;39:23;"That the bands we're talking about, there's always something funny."
39:23;39:24;"So where do we end up?"
39:24;39:28;"Eagles, Aerosmith, and the Chili Peppers."
39:28;39:32;"Honorable mention for the Beach Boys."
39:32;39:35;"And the good old Grateful Dead, man."
39:35;39:38;"But part of the reason that we love the Dead is similar to the Chili Peppers,"
39:38;39:44;"is they have these like, ""What the f***"" moments that not everybody gets."
39:44;39:47;"It's like, why are they just..."
39:47;39:52;"Mostly Bob Weir's contributions."
39:52;39:57;"I can see the Dead through the eyes of somebody who would have been more into"
39:57;39:59;"Led Zeppelin and The Who or something."
39:59;40:05;"I can totally imagine somebody who was into that specific type of big-name rock bands"
40:05;40:10;"and them going to a Dead show in the late '70s and seeing these guys"
40:10;40:15;"just do a 15-minute version of ""Not Fade Away"" and just be like,"
40:15;40:17;"""What the f*** is this?"""
40:17;40:19;"And be like, ""No, but Jerry's really good."""
40:19;40:21;"And then even that, just not being able to..."
40:21;40:22;"I can see it through the haters' eyes."
40:22;40:26;"But anyway, the last thing I'll say is that one thought I have about this"
40:26;40:30;"is that maybe America also is just like, it's too big of a country."
40:30;40:36;"So we don't have a Rolling Stones, but we have Leonard Skinner and the Allman Brothers."
40:36;40:40;"You can't pick a Southern rock band to represent all of America."
40:40;40:44;"They represent where they're from and their beloved bands and their institutions."
40:44;40:47;"Or even Red Hot Chili Peppers are so California."
40:47;40:53;"A British band can be super British-y because it's a smaller country."
40:53;40:58;"And I'm sure English people would obviously still have their own regional biases"
40:58;41:02;"about which artists they feel represent them or their point of view."
41:02;41:05;"But all these bands, they're just so specific to their place."
41:05;41:08;"Red Hot Chili Peppers is obviously such an LA band."
41:08;41:12;"The idea of them representing the Purple Mountains of Majesty,"
41:12;41:15;"the Badlands of North Dakota."
41:15;41:17;"That's a really good point."
41:17;41:22;"The artist that makes me think that they sort of did that would be Springsteen in the '80s."
41:22;41:27;"Not a band, as discussed, but he was definitely reaching for that."
41:27;41:29;"That evens the playing field or something."
41:29;41:32;"If somebody was like, a lot of great bands started in London."
41:32;41:34;"The Clash, the Rolling Stones, whatever."
41:34;41:36;"What great band started in New York?"
41:36;41:38;"And then you'd be like, oh man, where to start? Velvet Underwear?"
41:38;41:42;"There's something about that conversation that suddenly feels like an even playing field."
41:42;41:45;"Or even just being like, if you went city by city,"
41:45;41:49;"what are great bands from LA or San Francisco as opposed to Manchester?"
41:49;41:52;"And you'd be like, well Manchester, of course you have the Smiths, Neogala."
41:52;41:57;"But San Francisco, you have the Grateful Dead and Green Day."
41:57;41:58;"The Dead Kennedys."
41:58;41:59;"Dead Kennedys."
41:59;42:04;"Something about that conversation, suddenly I can see it in focus more."
42:04;42:06;"And I'm kind of like, oh yeah, of course."
42:06;42:11;"These American cities have amazing histories, as do those English cities."
42:11;42:13;"It just all makes more sense that way."
42:13;42:17;"America never really had a fair shot. It's just too big of a country."
42:17;42:18;"Great thesis."
42:18;42:19;"Thank you."
42:19;42:23;"I've got a bad disease"
42:23;42:30;"Off from my brain is where I bleed"
42:30;42:34;"Insanity it seems"
42:34;42:41;"Has got me by my soul to squeeze"
42:41;42:45;"Without a love for me"
42:47;42:52;"Without a dietary's I squeeze"
42:52;42:57;"The angels in my dream"
42:57;43:03;"In turn to demons of greed that's me"
43:03;43:08;"Where I go I just don't know"
43:08;43:14;"Like I took, I took, I took it slow"
43:14;43:19;"When I find my peace of mind"
43:19;43:24;"I'm gonna give you some of my good time"
43:24;43:28;"We just took a short break and we started talking about coffee."
43:28;43:33;"And then suddenly everybody's got some, no pun intended, hot takes."
43:33;43:39;"So Jake and Nick just said to me that the first cup of the day has got to be hot."
43:39;43:46;"And these are two Angelinos living in this godforsaken desert town"
43:46;43:51;"with the cloudless skies and the sun beating down on you."
43:51;43:57;"And even in this environment, you two are insisting that the first cup of the day has got to be hot?"
43:57;43:58;"Absolutely."
43:58;43:59;"Yeah."
43:59;44:04;"I think my palate is what you, it doesn't matter what's going on with the temperature."
44:04;44:08;"My palate wants just sort of a hot coffee."
44:08;44:13;"Obviously in quarantine, I imagine people's options are somewhat limited"
44:13;44:20;"because it's not like you can just go take a bleary-eyed walk to the local coffee shop and get an iced coffee."
44:20;44:24;"So yeah, at home, the easiest way to make coffee generally is hot coffee."
44:24;44:29;"But wait, Seinfeld, from a Canadian perspective, you're also agreeing first cup of the day's got to be hot?"
44:29;44:34;"No, I wouldn't say, like, well, I think in Canada it's a little different."
44:34;44:39;"You don't want to be drinking cold coffee on, like, a February morning, for sure."
44:39;44:42;"Right, but then, you know, of course it can get hot in the summer in Canada."
44:42;44:48;"Yeah, but then I think you're in the habit of drinking hot coffee because of those winters, so it just sort of carries through."
44:48;44:52;"I mean, I guess there are certain people who will switch over, but that's never been my..."
44:52;44:55;"Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense because in the winter,"
44:55;45:00;"an average Canadian also gets in the habit of wearing a toque and snowshoes."
45:00;45:04;"That's a habit you break in the summer."
45:04;45:09;"Some people wear those toques year-round, though. Some people are going to wear a toque in July."
45:09;45:14;"I got to ask you, am I using that correctly? Does a toque imply kind of like a heavy-ish, like, knit winter hat?"
45:14;45:19;"It does, and I got to say, what do you call it here, beanie?"
45:19;45:21;"Yeah, often it's a beanie."
45:21;45:26;"A beanie, for me, is one of those, like, kids' multicolored hats with a propeller on top."
45:26;45:28;"Oh, right, like a '50s..."
45:28;45:32;"Like a 1950s, yeah, with, like, the spinning propeller."
45:32;45:38;"That's something I got to admit, is that any American who thinks that ""toque"" is a funny word,"
45:38;45:41;"there's nothing funnier about the word ""toque"" than ""beanie."""
45:41;45:43;"Arguably, ""beanie"" is even goofier."
45:43;45:45;"""Beanie"" sounds insane."
45:45;45:51;"But Seinfeld, what about now that you live in the godforsaken desert town of Los Angeles?"
45:51;45:57;"I'm drinking the cold brew. I'll have a bunch in the fridge, so I'll grab one in the morning,"
45:57;45:59;"but it doesn't really hit me. Like, I need more than that,"
45:59;46:05;"so the cold brew is almost just like a precursor to the main course, which is like a second cup of coffee."
46:05;46:06;"A hot coffee."
46:06;46:09;"The hot coffee. Yeah, I'm building up to that hot coffee."
46:09;46:13;"And there's no kind of temperature whiplash happening in your body?"
46:13;46:16;"Well, I'm doing this over the course of, let's say, an hour, an hour and a half,"
46:16;46:20;"so it's not like I'm just, like, pounding the cold brew then immediately into the hot coffee."
46:20;46:25;"I just got to say that I have such great memories of, in the old world,"
46:25;46:31;"not having a coffee yet, and bleary-eyed rolling up to a restaurant and ordering an iced coffee,"
46:31;46:35;"and it's coming out cold as f*** with some big ice cubes,"
46:35;46:41;"and just slurping down that restaurant-quality iced coffee, and just being off to the races,"
46:41;46:43;"often getting a second one very quickly."
46:43;46:48;"Or, you know, walking around on a hot New York day and just rolling up to Dunkin' Donuts"
46:48;46:53;"to get my big iced coffee, and just hitting that, and the combination of the caffeine"
46:53;46:58;"and the Arctic freeze of the ice, just an amazing feeling."
46:58;47:01;"I think the disadvantage of the ice, though, is that it melts,"
47:01;47:07;"so that by the end of the coffee, you're drinking, like, watery, diluted, kind of swill coffee."
47:07;47:09;"I think that's part of the charm of the iced coffee."
47:09;47:15;"I guess also I consume things so quickly. I'm a fast eater, I'm a fast drinker,"
47:15;47:19;"that that's not too much of a problem for me. I guess I see what you're saying."
47:19;47:25;"Sometimes when I'm having my third or fourth iced coffee of the day, like a 3pm one,"
47:25;47:29;"and it's like... I mean, I'm not saying it's not more. There's people who have 10."
47:29;47:31;"I'm saying third or fourth is like the end."
47:31;47:32;"Ice coffees?"
47:32;47:38;"Maybe. I'm picturing a small one. I'm picturing 3pm, rolling up to some coffee shop,"
47:38;47:42;"and not exactly needing it, but getting it to be social, and then holding it,"
47:42;47:46;"and then it gets watered down and feeling kind of gross about the whole situation."
47:46;47:49;"I agree. That's a bad feeling. But I'm just saying, first things first."
47:49;47:51;"I love that Arctic Blast."
47:51;47:57;"I like the concept of getting the iced coffee to be social. It's like it's booze."
47:57;47:58;"Totally."
47:58;48:04;"At a bar. I've done that move of like, ""I don't need this eighth beer, but I'm just going to nurse it."
48:04;48:09;"I'm going to hold it."" But doing that with iced coffee at 3pm is so funny."
48:09;48:14;"No, but you know what's funny? That's such a more familiar feeling to me than what you're talking about."
48:14;48:19;"Because even though I can on occasion drink, I'm not anti-drinking."
48:19;48:23;"It's just one of those things though where I just-- maybe sometime in college,"
48:23;48:27;"where people always pressure you to drink, I think maybe I just had one too many times"
48:27;48:31;"of getting too f***ed up or something, and I was like, ""I'm not going to not drink."""
48:31;48:36;"But a flip switched in me where I was just kind of like, ""I will never be forced to drink again."""
48:36;48:42;"And I'm very impressionable, but that was just one thing where I put my foot down,"
48:42;48:45;"and I did get to a point where it's kind of like, ""Yo, yo, come on. No, are you serious?"
48:45;48:47;"Come on, have another drink. I'm getting drinks."""
48:47;48:51;"That's just one thing where I put my foot down. I'm like, ""Friend, you can buy it."
48:51;48:54;"You can put it in front of me. I will not drink it. Save yourself the cash."
48:54;48:56;"I don't want it. I don't need it. I'll have a water."""
48:56;49:00;"For some reason, I got that way. Maybe because my body can process caffeine better."
49:00;49:01;"So there's less of a--"
49:01;49:07;"Do you never, ever, on that third or fourth iced coffee, ever go over the edge?"
49:07;49:11;"No, I feel like my body's got a limiter."
49:11;49:13;"I've got built-in compression."
49:13;49:18;"I can feel that I have as much as I need, and it's not exactly pleasant,"
49:18;49:23;"but somehow I don't get into that full-on just like, ""Whoa,"" crazy vibe."
49:23;49:25;"To me, it's almost like that feeling of just eating a little too much,"
49:25;49:28;"where you're just like, ""Mm,"" but you're not nauseous."
49:28;49:30;"That's the analogy that I would use."
49:30;49:32;"Well, time to change gears."
49:32;49:36;"Weirdly, we've had a lot of time-crisis-y stories in the news,"
49:36;49:39;"and we're kind of staying on top of them in a strange way."
49:39;49:43;"Very atypical for us, but we got a lot of people saying,"
49:43;49:47;"""Guys, there's some big corporate food shenanigans happening,"
49:47;49:51;"and it involves a place that we have not talked about very much on this show,"
49:51;49:53;"and that place is Chuck E. Cheese."""
49:53;49:58;"We got two very well-researched emails about it."
49:58;50:01;"It seems like it's about time to go deep on Chuck E. Cheese,"
50:01;50:03;"a little bit of corporate food history."
50:03;50:04;"It's time for--"
50:04;50:07;"Corporate Food History."
50:07;50:09;"Let's talk about it."
50:09;50:13;"We got emails from-- Who were they from?"
50:13;50:19;"I know one was from Holly McLaren, who's a longtime friend of the show."
50:19;50:21;"Didn't we meet Holly in Chicago, Jake?"
50:21;50:22;"Yeah, I think so."
50:22;50:27;"Holly, who runs the TCU Wikipedia page."
50:27;50:29;"Holly runs the TCU Wikip-- Oh."
50:29;50:33;"Yeah, let me do a quick fact check, but I'm 99% sure that's her."
50:33;50:36;"I think-- Because we met this great crew of TC heads"
50:36;50:39;"at the Richard Pictures show in Chicago."
50:39;50:41;"I think Holly was one of them."
50:41;50:45;"If I'm wrong, either way, Holly, you're still a pillar of the community,"
50:45;50:47;"because I've definitely seen your name pop up before."
50:47;50:48;"Yeah."
50:48;50:50;"She was talking about it, Chuck E. Cheese,"
50:50;50:53;"with their viral moment recently."
50:53;50:58;"We also got one from Justin Jordan, talking about the scandal."
50:58;51:03;"The TC community was right there, following this story."
51:03;51:07;"I guess to summarize why Chuck E. Cheese is in the news in the first place,"
51:07;51:09;"you guys, tell me if this is correct."
51:09;51:10;"This is my understanding."
51:10;51:14;"I didn't dive too deep on it, because I wanted to come in fresh."
51:14;51:17;"My basic understanding is that Chuck E. Cheese,"
51:17;51:22;"obviously, their bread and butter is pizza and games."
51:22;51:23;"Right?"
51:23;51:27;"You go there, you buy some soda and pizza,"
51:27;51:30;"but then the kids are just going wild, playing games."
51:30;51:31;"They have beer there."
51:31;51:35;"The parents are just chugging beer, kids are eating pizza, they're gaming."
51:35;51:40;"It's very much about the in-person experience of going to a Chuck E. Cheese."
51:40;51:44;"Chuck E. Cheese is not particularly known for takeout or delivery."
51:44;51:46;"Maybe they have it a little bit,"
51:46;51:49;"but obviously, Chuck E. Cheese is a real in-person kind of place."
51:49;51:53;"Wait, I have to just say, I'm sorry, but it would be insane,"
51:53;51:55;"as the parent of the oldest child here,"
51:55;51:59;"it would be insane to tell your kids that you were picking up Chuck E. Cheese"
51:59;52:01;"and not taking them there."
52:01;52:03;"[laughter]"
52:03;52:05;"They'd f***ing go insane."
52:05;52:12;"That kind of reminds me of some of the most brutally strict parents that I would know."
52:12;52:16;"I do kind of remember these kids in my town who I knew a little bit."
52:16;52:19;"And growing up, we didn't have cable,"
52:19;52:21;"so I already felt a little bit f***ed over, like,"
52:21;52:23;"""Man, how do I not have cable?"""
52:23;52:26;"I used to go and watch Beavis and Butthead over at Wes's house."
52:26;52:29;"But then I went over to these other kids' houses,"
52:29;52:32;"and their parents, obviously, they didn't have cable either,"
52:32;52:36;"but their parents would only let them watch PBS."
52:36;52:41;"They couldn't even watch the good shows on NBC or Channel 11 or something."
52:41;52:43;"They could only watch PBS."
52:43;52:45;"And even at that, there were hardcore restrictions."
52:45;52:47;"And I remember seeing that and being like,"
52:47;52:50;"""Wow, truly, our fate's worse than death."""
52:50;52:53;"The idea--and I like some PBS stuff--"
52:53;52:56;"but the idea, as a 10-year-old kid,"
52:56;52:58;"that the only channel you could watch is PBS,"
52:58;53:00;"I wept for them."
53:00;53:01;"It was so brutally strict."
53:01;53:03;"And actually, there's another family--"
53:03;53:05;"I didn't know them that well in my town,"
53:05;53:07;"but I remember other kids telling me"
53:07;53:10;"that this other family had very strict parents"
53:10;53:13;"and that they would only let them watch movies"
53:13;53:16;"that the parents had done their own."
53:16;53:17;"[laughter]"
53:17;53:18;"Wow."
53:18;53:22;"And I think the son in the family was really into comics and sci-fi,"
53:22;53:24;"but with some harsh restrictions."
53:24;53:26;"So I think he was really into Star Wars,"
53:26;53:30;"but his parents insisted on creating an edit of the--"
53:30;53:32;"You know one of the Star Wars movies has Princess Leia"
53:32;53:34;"in a kind of gold bikini?"
53:34;53:35;"Yeah, I think that's Return of the Jedi."
53:35;53:38;"Yeah, the parents would not let that pass in front of his eyes."
53:38;53:40;"So they did an edit where they took that out"
53:40;53:41;"and various violent--"
53:41;53:43;"I mean, it was probably nonsensical."
53:43;53:47;"But anyway, I can totally picture a super strict '90s parent"
53:47;53:50;"and the kids just like, ""For the love of God, Mom, at school,"
53:50;53:52;"all the kids are talking about this sick party"
53:52;53:54;"they went to at Chuck E. Cheese."
53:54;53:56;"I want to go so bad."
53:56;53:58;"Like I saw the commercial at my friend's house."
53:58;53:59;"I want to go so bad."""
53:59;54:02;"Just be like, ""Well, listen, Jason,"
54:02;54:04;"I know we probably seem pretty strict"
54:04;54:06;"compared to some of the other parents,"
54:06;54:07;"but we're reasonable people."
54:07;54:09;"You know, you'd be very pleased to know"
54:09;54:12;"that your father right now is on his way to Chuck E. Cheese"
54:12;54:16;"to pick up one cheese pie for you."
54:16;54:19;"You can go back to school and tell all the other kids"
54:19;54:22;"that you have also enjoyed Chuck E. Cheese."""
54:22;54:25;"And just like the kid just being like, ""Oh, my God."""
54:25;54:26;"I bet that's happened."
54:26;54:28;"I bet at least once or twice,"
54:28;54:30;"like an insanely strict parent and being like--"
54:30;54:32;"and be like, ""But it's also about the toys."""
54:32;54:36;"And be like, ""Your father also played skee-ball for 20 minutes"
54:36;54:39;"and he's bringing you back one of those little army men"
54:39;54:40;"with the parachutes."
54:40;54:42;"You cannot go there yourself,"
54:42;54:45;"but your father will bring you back the cheese pizza"
54:45;54:47;"plus the army men with the parachute."""
54:47;54:49;"Just like taking all the fun out of it."
54:49;54:51;"Jason's dad calls Chuck E. Cheese and is like,"
54:51;54:53;"""Hi, I'd like to make an order for pickup, please."""
54:53;54:55;"And they're like, ""Excuse me, sir?"""
54:55;54:57;"[laughing]"
54:57;54:59;"-Come again? -Just like the 16-year-old"
54:59;55:01;"who works there is just like, ""Um..."""
55:01;55:03;"""Let me check with my manager."
55:03;55:06;"I don't think we actually have to-go boxes on the premises."""
55:06;55:09;"You know what also probably has been a classic awkward exchange"
55:09;55:11;"between parents and Chuck E. Cheese employees"
55:11;55:13;"is just like the dad being like,"
55:13;55:17;"""All right, what's it gonna take for me to buy that Xbox?"""
55:17;55:19;"And they're like, ""Well, sir, you know,"
55:19;55:22;"it's, um, two million Chuck E. points."""
55:22;55:24;"""All right, cut the sh*t."
55:24;55:27;"I gotta get going. It's my kid's f*cking birthday."
55:27;55:29;"Now he's obsessed with winning this."
55:29;55:30;"What do I have to do?"""
55:30;55:32;"And just be like, ""Um..."""
55:32;55:34;"Or maybe that's built in."
55:34;55:36;"Maybe they have a list of prices"
55:36;55:38;"and they're just like jacked up prices just for parents to..."
55:38;55:42;"Trump's dad's Chuck E. Cheese is such a rough image."
55:42;55:44;"Oh, God."
55:44;55:46;"Picture how many times there's probably been like"
55:46;55:48;"a drunk parent rolling up with the kid"
55:48;55:50;"and the kid being like counting all the things"
55:50;55:53;"and then the kid being like three tickets short"
55:53;55:55;"of getting something."
55:55;55:57;"And dad being like, ""All right, I'll give you $3."""
55:57;56:00;"That's well above market value for, you know,"
56:00;56:02;"the cost of those tickets."
56:02;56:05;"""Um, sir, I can sell you some tokens."
56:05;56:08;"You can go back to Skee-Ball and you can win it."""
56:08;56:11;"And just be like, ""No. I've been here for four hours."""
56:11;56:13;"""Here's the tickets. Here's the five bucks."
56:13;56:16;"You give me that f***ing giant pencil now."""
56:16;56:17;"Oh, my God."
56:17;56:20;"I wonder if like that's the worst job is working at the, uh..."
56:20;56:21;"What do you call that?"
56:21;56:22;"The prize center?"
56:22;56:23;"Yeah."
56:23;56:24;"Well, what are the, um..."
56:24;56:26;"It's a fulfillment center."
56:26;56:27;"Exactly."
56:27;56:29;"Before Amazon, it was the Chuck E. Cheese fulfillment center."
56:29;56:32;"Fulfillment center is one of the all-time classic phrases."
56:32;56:36;"In terms of corporate euphemisms"
56:36;56:38;"for just like distro centers,"
56:38;56:40;"fulfillment center."
56:40;56:42;"That's pretty guided by voices, too."
56:42;56:44;"Fulfillment center."

58:00;58:03;"- So back to the main story, is that, so Chuck E. Cheese,"
58:03;58:07;"like all restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic,"
58:07;58:08;"they can't have people in."
58:08;58:11;"And Chuck E. Cheese is especially hard hit"
58:11;58:12;"because even though it's a restaurant,"
58:12;58:14;"it's all about having people there."
58:14;58:18;"I'm sure Dave & Buster's is really struggling right now too."
58:18;58:20;"And they're gonna, it's gonna be a tough road for them,"
58:20;58:23;"reopening with all the (beep) that people touch"
58:23;58:24;"with the video games and stuff."
58:24;58:27;"But so Chuck E. Cheese, I think they were trying"
58:27;58:31;"to figure out, well, we have our employees on the payroll."
58:31;58:35;"We have all this dough and cheese sitting here"
58:35;58:36;"and we have our ovens."
58:36;58:38;"Maybe we can get people to order from us."
58:38;58:41;"But who, again, who wants to, if you're gonna order"
58:41;58:44;"from a pizza just to be delivered to your home,"
58:44;58:46;"Chuck E. Cheese is gonna be the last place you think about."
58:46;58:51;"So because Chuck E. Cheese delivery sales were so low,"
58:51;58:53;"they figured, (beep) it, we can just rebrand,"
58:53;58:54;"make up a new name."
58:54;58:57;"And they started calling themselves Pascuales,"
58:57;58:59;"which is a reference to one of the characters"
58:59;59:02;"in the Chuck E. Cheese extended universe."
59:02;59:06;"So I guess somebody would be opening up Uber Eats,"
59:06;59:08;"Grubhub, DoorDash, any of that (beep)"
59:08;59:09;"and they would see, you know,"
59:09;59:12;"pizza near me, Italian restaurants near me."
59:12;59:14;"And they would see a place called Pascuales"
59:14;59:15;"and they would order."
59:15;59:17;"And then they would just get a Chuck E. Cheese pizza"
59:17;59:18;"delivered to their house without realizing"
59:18;59:20;"they were ordering from Chuck E. Cheese."
59:20;59:22;"So when this story broke open,"
59:22;59:26;"obviously people were dying with laughter, also offended."
59:26;59:28;"So that got us thinking about Chuck E. Cheese"
59:28;59:30;"and we realized, similar to Red Lobster last week,"
59:30;59:32;"we've talked about them very little."
59:32;59:34;"So Jake, you did a little bit of your own research."
59:34;59:38;"Take us back through the story of Chuck E. Cheese"
59:38;59:40;"before the Pascuales misadventure."
59:40;59:42;"- Well, yeah, I was surprised to learn that"
59:42;59:45;"Chuck E. Cheese is a product of Silicon Valley."
59:45;59:49;"Not only did it open in Silicon Valley,"
59:49;59:51;"the first location was in 1977,"
59:51;59:54;"which is obviously a year close to my heart."
59:54;59:56;"- The year Jake was born."
59:56;59:58;"- Jake and Kanye and Chuck E. Cheese"
59:58;01:00:02;"opened their first location in San Jose in '77."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- And when you say a product of Silicon Valley,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"you just mean it was in the region"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"or there's some kind of tech money behind it?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- There's deep tech money behind it."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"It was founded by a guy named Nolan Bushnell,"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"who was also the co-founder of Atari."
01:00:17;01:00:22;"He had started Atari back in 1972 in Silicon Valley"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"and he was looking, I think at the time in '77,"
01:00:26;01:00:30;"a lot of the arcade games were in pool halls, bars,"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"or those kind of classic arcades"
01:00:33;01:00:36;"that maybe older teens were hanging out at."
01:00:36;01:00:40;"He wanted to open a venue where children"
01:00:40;01:00:44;"and their parents could play arcade video games."
01:00:44;01:00:48;"And then he chose pizza because it's very easy"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"and hard to mess up, and kids like pizza."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"So yeah, just a few bullet points here."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"So he starts Atari in '72, and in '77,"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"the same year that he opens Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"he's looking for more capital to expand Atari"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"and he sells Atari to Warner Communications"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"for $28 million, which must have been huge at the time."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"- Wow."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- And then the following year,"
01:01:10;01:01:14;"he's forced out of Atari by Warner."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"So he starts Atari, does it for five years,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"sells it, is forced out, then starts Chuck E. Cheese"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"basically around the same time."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And then Chuck E. Cheese is classic."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"It just goes to this series of different owners"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"and mergers that are just boring."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"- It was called Chuck E. Cheese from the jump?"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- Yeah, it was called Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"like Pizza Time Theater,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"some awkwardly long name initially."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"And he was really inspired by Disney,"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"which is why he had all these animatronic animals"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"in the restaurant."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- Right, it's almost like a mini Disneyland."
01:01:47;01:01:52;"- And he thought he was buying an animatronic coyote,"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"but it ended up being a rat, which is how the rat,"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"and it was just hilarious to have a rat"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"as like a restaurant mascot."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- So Chuck E. Cheese is a rat, not a mouse."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Yes."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"- I guess he's got that kind of long, long snout."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- So I found like a couple interesting anecdotes"
01:02:06;01:02:09;"related to Nolan Bushnell."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"In 1976, Steve Jobs approached Nolan Bushnell."
01:02:14;01:02:18;"He asked Nolan for $50,000 to put into Apple."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"And if Nolan had given him the 50 grand,"
01:02:20;01:02:23;"he would have had a third of Apple."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- Holy (beep)"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"- Yeah, so, but he turned Steve Jobs down."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"This was actually a thing I found in the Jobs biography"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"by Walter Isaacson."
01:02:33;01:02:36;"Steve asked me if I would put $50,000 in"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"and he would give me a third of the company."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"I was so smart, I said, no."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"It's kind of fun to think about it when I'm not crying."
01:02:42;01:02:46;"But it got me thinking of like the following year,"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"he opens Chuck E. Cheese"
01:02:48;01:02:51;"and he's like a big player around like Silicon Valley."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"And it got me thinking like,"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"did Steve Jobs go to the first Chuck E. Cheese?"
01:02:55;01:02:58;"Like, it's so funny to think about like"
01:02:58;01:03:01;"a year prior, Nolan had turned him down,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"but they're still in touch."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"Like, you know, maybe they're like acquaintances"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"professionally or socially, just like,"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"Hey Steve, I'm opening this like children themed"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"pizza restaurant in San Jose."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Come on down for the opening."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"- Yeah, and also at that moment,"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Nolan is still kind of the man as compared to Steve."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"And he's like, Hey Steve, I know we haven't talked in a while."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"First of all, I hope there's no hard feelings"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"about me not kicking you the 50K."
01:03:26;01:03:29;"I'm sure you're going to do okay, even without me."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"But anyway, just so you know, there's no hard feelings."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"I hope I didn't let you down too much with that one."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"I'd love for you and your girlfriend,"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"you could bring Wozniak to,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"come down to my grand opening,"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"all the pizza you want."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"And you know, there's some, you know, it's kid stuff,"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"but you know, it's kind of cute."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"You'll have a good time."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Just like magnanimously being like, come on down."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- I love the picture."
01:03:50;01:03:52;"And then the other thing I found that"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"really sparked my imagination was in 2008,"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"it was announced that Leonardo DiCaprio"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"would portray Nolan Bushnell in the film ""Atari,"""
01:04:02;01:04:04;"an adaption of Bushnell's life story,"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"which talk about missed opportunities."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"Okay."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Granted the like Silicon Valley,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Atari stuff would have been fascinating,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"but like the last third of the film where Leo was like"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"opening Chuck E. Cheese would have been like,"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"just full on like the last third of like good fellas."
01:04:21;01:04:24;"It just would have like been so good."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- Oh, amazing."
01:04:25;01:04:28;"- Leo in '77 opening Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"just, we really missed out."
01:04:30;01:04:35;"- '77, punk rock is just changing culture in the UK"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"and in Silicon Valley, San Jose,"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"opening the first Chuck E. Cheese."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"You know, that also makes me think of is like,"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"I don't know exactly when Steve Jobs got involved,"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"but not, you know, a decade or two later,"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Steve Jobs has his own children's"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"entertainment thing, Pixar."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"I know we take it for granted now that it's like,"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"of course, Pixar, you know, is part of Apple."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"Steve Jobs was one of the original"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"or early investors, principals in Pixar."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"That was one, his baby along with the guys"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"who actually founded it."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"But still it's like, that's pretty unusual"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"that like a computer company was like getting"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"so interested in computer animation"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"and like changing the face of children's entertainment."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"Maybe Nolan Bushnell planted the seed back in the '70s."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"Be like, it's not enough just to create"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"these like products, you know,"
01:05:21;01:05:24;"you need to like own the hearts and minds."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"You need IP, man."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"You need characters."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- Yeah, you gotta create a lifelong relationship"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"with children."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"- Another thing that I'm thinking of,"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"I mean, Silicon Valley is obviously"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"such a fascinating, strange place,"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"that whole region of Northern California."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"I'm not being obsessive here."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"This is just right in front of me."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"You know what other American institution"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"got its start at a Silicon Valley pizzeria?"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"- Was it at the Roundtable in Palo Alto?"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"'Cause that's where, this Roundtable started"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"in Palo Alto in the mid '60s."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"Oh, the Dead, the Dead."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- The Dead."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"The first Grateful Dead concert."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"It might've been under the name of the Warlocks."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"See what comes up when you search"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"the first Grateful Dead concert."
01:06:04;01:06:07;"- Now, now, now, now, now, now, now,"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"let's get a number crunch."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"- Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza Parlor,"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue"
01:06:18;01:06:20;"in suburban Menlo Park."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- Menlo Park, that's basically part of Palo Alto."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"What year was that, '65?"
01:06:24;01:06:25;"- May 5th, 1965."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"- It's only 12 years before,"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"look, I'm not just trying to circle"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"the conversation back to the Dead here."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"I think that's striking."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Silicon Valley pizzerias,"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"with this weird connection to both"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"the Grateful Dead, Atari, Steve Jobs."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Suddenly you have this very interesting"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"patchwork of influential things."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Anyway, yeah, were there any more"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"twists and turns in the Chuck E. Cheese story?"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"- He was forced out of the Chuck E. Cheese board"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"in '84 when they were on the brink of bankruptcy."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"And that's where I'm picturing"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"the Leonardo DiCaprio movie kinda ending."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"Just like, yeah."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"- Just down on his luck."
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- I mean, he's doing fine."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"He's like, started Atari and he's out."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"- Right."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"- Started Chuck E. Cheese and he's out."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"And it's like 1984."
01:07:07;01:07:10;"And like Apple is just becoming a sin at that point."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"- That's pretty rough though to get"
01:07:11;01:07:15;"forced out of two of your brain children."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"You get forced out of Atari, then Chuck E. Cheese."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"I guess eventually he got the last laugh"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"'cause Atari basically tanked after his era."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"- Yeah, I was reading today,"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"Atari was absolutely crushing it in '82,"
01:07:28;01:07:33;"but by '84 they were way on the outs."
01:07:33;01:07:36;"- There is a book that I read once called,"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"I think it was called Console Wars."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"It's basically about the war between Nintendo and Sega."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"- I remember you telling me about this."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"- Yeah, it's actually a pretty interesting book."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"And I think there was also a Hollywood,"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"like a variety article saying like,"
01:07:48;01:07:49;"that Seth Rogen optioned it."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"You know, that'd be kind of a tight movie."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"I must've referenced that, I'm sure,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"probably like 100 episodes ago,"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"because it's actually a really interesting story"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"about like corporate (beep)"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"because the guy who turned Sega around"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"wasn't a video game guy."
01:08:01;01:08:04;"He was a guy from Mattel who had kind of like"
01:08:04;01:08:08;"spearheaded like He-Man and like Strawberry Shortcake"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"and (beep) like that."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"And they brought this guy and he's like,"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"""Listen, I don't know a lot about video games,"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"""but what I do know is branding and IP"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"""and winning the hearts and minds of children."""
01:08:16;01:08:19;"And so anyway, Sega really gave Nintendo"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"a run for their money"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and they actually overtook them briefly in the '90s."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"But before that, before Nintendo just took over the world,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"the picture that they paint in this book"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"is that with the kind of collapse of Atari"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"in the early '80s, there was this weird period"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"in the mid '80s where people were like,"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"""Video games are over."""
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- Yeah."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- In the world of toys and entertainment,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I guess the vibe everybody got was like,"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Atari had its run, which is always funny to think."
01:08:43;01:08:46;"I guess hindsight's 20/20, but these moments in history"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"where people looked at something and they were like,"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"""Yeah, no, that was cool."""
01:08:50;01:08:51;"I bet people also felt that way"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"about all sorts of like musical genres."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"I'm sure there was a moment when after,"
01:08:55;01:08:58;"in like the early '80s, after like ""Rapper's Delight,"""
01:08:58;01:09:00;"people were like, ""Well, rap was a cool kind of like"

01:10:13;01:10:16;"Matt just found something that he sent to Seinfeld,"
01:10:16;01:10:20;"which is kind of like a third strike for Nolan Bushnell."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"So not only was he kicked off the Atari board"
01:10:22;01:10:27;"and then he missed out on owning a third of Apple,"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"it turns out that his connection to Pixar"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"is not just the vague Steve Jobs connection"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"in children's entertainment, it goes even a little deeper."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"So check this out."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"What was just unearthed?"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"- Yeah, so Bushnell was one of the people"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"behind a company called Cadaveroscope,"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"which was a very early attempt at computer animation."
01:10:46;01:10:50;"That company was then sold to Lucasfilm,"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"which ultimately became Pixar."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- Damn."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"- That's even funnier that he knew Steve Jobs personally,"
01:10:57;01:11:02;"but this like other, I guess, like company/portfolio"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"of computer animation technology he helped develop"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"ended up back in Jobs' hands later,"
01:11:07;01:11:10;"meaning that he missed out on owning a third of Apple"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"and in a weird way, he kind of like almost missed out"
01:11:13;01:11:15;"on being part of Pixar."
01:11:15;01:11:18;"And apparently his computer animation company,"
01:11:18;01:11:21;"they made a TV movie."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"What was it called?"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"It was about Chuck E. Cheese?"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"- Yeah, it was called ""Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"""The Christmas That Almost Wasn't,"""
01:11:27;01:11:29;"and it was under the subsidiary"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"of the Chuck E. Cheese Pizza Time Theaters Company."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- What year was that?"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"- '83."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"- Oh, man."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"- I wonder what that animation looked like back then."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- Raw."
01:11:38;01:11:42;"- It just looked like the Dire Straits music video."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Clearly, like Nolan Bushnell,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"he's like a Nikola Tesla or something."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"You know, one of these guys who's just like--"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"- He did do very well."
01:11:49;01:11:54;"I mean, he could sell Atari for $28 million in 1977,"
01:11:54;01:11:57;"and he did like a ton of other ventures after that"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"that didn't really take off to the same extent."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"- He did okay, but it's just like the fact that he--"
01:12:03;01:12:06;"as far as like the cushy life of a corporate tech guy goes,"
01:12:06;01:12:10;"it's kind of hard knocking that he was lost control"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"of two companies that he helped start,"
01:12:13;01:12:16;"and he had these very notable forks in the road"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"where he missed out on being part of, like,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"something truly gigantic."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"I just mean, like, in this case,"
01:12:21;01:12:24;"maybe Steve Jobs is like Thomas Edison,"
01:12:24;01:12:25;"and he's like, you know, Tesla."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"We know the name today."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"There's a car named after it."
01:12:28;01:12:32;"He still had, like, his very special contributions"
01:12:32;01:12:33;"to science and technology."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"He just didn't quite get to be the electricity guy."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"That's actually this other movie that I've been kind of like--"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"that kind of came and went that I was stoked about."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"I don't even remember what the name is."
01:12:42;01:12:43;"Do any of you guys know?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"It basically was like the electricity movie,"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"and it's like somebody plays Edison,"
01:12:47;01:12:48;"somebody plays Tesla,"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"and somebody plays Westinghouse."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Is it called, like, ""Current Wars""?"
01:12:52;01:12:53;"- Yeah. Yeah."
01:12:53;01:12:54;"- ""The Current War""? - Tom Holland."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"- That's funny. - Tom Holland."
01:12:55;01:12:59;"- Maybe one day when Seth Rogen makes ""Console Wars"" the movie,"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"we can do a double feature of ""Console Wars"""
01:13:02;01:13:03;"and ""The Current War."""
01:13:03;01:13:07;"But anyway, was there any resolution"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"to this Pasquales thing?"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Does anybody know?"
01:13:10;01:13:13;"- Well, if I could just set the record straight a little bit."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"- [laughs]"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"- You know, Pasquales Pizza and Wings,"
01:13:17;01:13:21;"it's not quite the same product as what Chuck E. Cheese sells."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"It's a different pizza."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"It's got a thicker crust."
01:13:24;01:13:25;"It's got extra sauce,"
01:13:25;01:13:28;"and it's got new blends of cheeses and spices."
01:13:28;01:13:31;"- Look at Seinfeld going to the mat for Pasquales."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"- Well, I just don't like--"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"- Seinfeld, if you've also been hired to do social media"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"and branding work for Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"you legally have to tell us."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- I'm just passionate about the brand."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"- [laughs]"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"You picture Seinfeld being like,"
01:13:43;01:13:46;"""You know, I have a really interesting portfolio"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"of clients and brands that I work with,"

01:13:51;01:13:53;"I help maintain those brands,"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"make sure that they have social media presence"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"that grows the brands."""
01:13:56;01:13:58;"But Seinfeld, is that like a press release"
01:13:58;01:13:59;"that Chuck E. Cheese put out that's like,"
01:13:59;01:14:00;"""Hold up, guys."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Don't pretend that we're trying to scam people."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"We're giving a different product."""
01:14:03;01:14:04;"- Yeah, I mean, that was--"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"I'm paraphrasing a statement"
01:14:06;01:14:09;"made by a representative for Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"but I stand by it."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"- Your gut is that they're good people."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Well, okay, but this is also something"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"I've been wanting to talk about on Time Crisis for a while,"
01:14:16;01:14:19;"and we probably don't have time to go super deep today,"

01:14:33;01:14:34;"is making any money."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"And in fact, I sent you guys this article that I found"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"that's about--called ""Pizza Arbitrage"" or something,"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"where basically a guy writes about"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"his friend owned a pizza place,"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"a real pizza place,"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"and they didn't do delivery."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"This guy was like, ""I'm not about delivery."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"I want people to come to my pizzeria and eat the pizza."""
01:14:51;01:14:54;"And he starts getting phone calls at the pizzeria"

01:14:55;01:14:57;"""Hey, man, I ordered a pizza from you guys,"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"and it showed up really cold."""

01:15:01;01:15:03;"""Well, we don't do delivery. It wasn't us."""
01:15:03;01:15:06;"And basically this guy finds out that DoorDash"
01:15:06;01:15:09;"put his business on their service without asking."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Insane."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"And they put a menu up."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"And, you know, I guess it's legal in the sense that"
01:15:14;01:15:17;"they can just--you're paying somebody to go to the pizza place"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"and buy something for you and bring it to your house,"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"but there's no coordination."

01:15:27;01:15:29;"and just bringing cold-ass pizza to people's houses."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"And this guy's like, ""I never signed up for this."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"What is this?"""
01:15:32;01:15:34;"And in fact, he realized that DoorDash was even"

01:15:43;01:15:45;"who's an economist or something,"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"convinced him to see if he could profit by"

01:18:55;01:18:57;"that sends food out."
01:18:57;01:18:58;"And I found, like, some article"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"where somebody in San Francisco"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"found, like, a really dingy ghost kitchen,"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"but on the app,"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"it's a little bit Chuck E. Cheese vibe"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"that on the app it's billed as, like,"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"""Signore Mario's authentic Italian pizza,"""
01:19:09;01:19:10;"and then you go,"
01:19:10;01:19:11;"and it's literally just, like,"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"one metal table"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"in, like, a dystopian,"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"like, fluorescent light."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"It sounds like Domino's or Papa John's."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Like, you don't eat at Domino's or Papa John's."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"It's all carry-out or delivery."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"Yeah, I guess in the case"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"of those places, though,"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"people, like, are very familiar"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"with the brand"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"and what it looks like"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"and with the vibe."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"Right."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Whereas now it's even weirder"
01:19:32;01:19:33;"because people are just kind of like,"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"""I want pizza,"""
01:19:34;01:19:35;"and, like, you might just get"
01:19:35;01:19:36;"some shit that pops up"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"that's just, like,"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"""Mario's pizza,"""
01:19:38;01:19:39;"and you're like, ""Well, I also want Chinese,"""
01:19:39;01:19:40;"and it's just, like,"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"""Fat Dragon Chinese,"""
01:19:42;01:19:44;"and literally, for all you know,"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"they could be the same metal table"
01:19:46;01:19:49;"in a giant industrial kitchen somewhere."
01:19:49;01:19:50;"And that's where you get, to me,"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"like, one step beyond."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"I'm not saying it doesn't make sense,"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"but it's a little bit like"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"one step beyond Domino's."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"But so there is something"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"to be said about, like,"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"it's not like Chuck E. Cheese"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"is, like, inventing this idea."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"They're probably like,"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"""Well, we have a network of kitchens"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"all over the country."""
01:20:06;01:20:07;"They're essentially turning"
01:20:07;01:20:08;"Chuck E. Cheese's"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"into ghost kitchens."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"In fact, I think people, like,"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"found it really funny"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"to imagine somebody"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"ordering from a place"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"called Pasquale's"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"and just getting a [bleep]"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"Chuck E. Cheese pizza."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"But it's also like"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"they might as well just start"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"making, like, other [bleep] too."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"You know, they could start"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"making, like, pies."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"-I think it is Pasquale's pizza"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"and wings."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"-Yeah, they make wings, too."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"-Did Chuck E. Cheese"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"traditionally have wings?"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"-I think so."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"I don't know."
01:20:32;01:20:33;"I can't speak to that."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"I'm assuming."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"-Well, Seinfeld,"
01:20:35;01:20:36;"have you had Pasquale's pizza,"
01:20:36;01:20:37;"and was it noticeably different"
01:20:37;01:20:38;"than Chuck E. Cheese's pizza?"
01:20:38;01:20:41;"-You know, I haven't had it personally,"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"but I feel like I understand"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"where they're coming from."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"But, no, I haven't tasted it myself."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"-Well, we got to taste it."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"-Very diplomatic."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"-Let's see if we can find some"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"for the next episode."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"We all order it to our homes."
01:20:54;01:20:55;"-Oh, my God."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"-I think there's another"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"funny thing, too,"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"where it's, like, as dystopian"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"as Domino's and Papa John's"
01:21:00;01:21:01;"might be,"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"you understand what"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"Domino's pizza tastes like,"
01:21:03;01:21:04;"and you understand"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"when you order from Domino's,"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"you're getting it from that"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"place called Domino's"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"that you drive past"
01:21:09;01:21:10;"and never go into."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"You understand where it is."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"With some of these ghost kitchens,"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"it literally might be"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"the same oven,"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"the same kitchen,"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"the same place"

01:21:27;01:21:28;"I'm not saying that they went this far,"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"but this would be, like,"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"the ghost kitchen way of doing things."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"Let's say that you're"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"a closed Chuck E. Cheese,"
01:21:34;01:21:35;"and you say to yourself,"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"like, ""All right, nobody wants"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"to buy Chuck E. Cheese pizza,"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"but they might want to buy"
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Pasquale's, which is something"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"that has a thicker crust."""
01:21:41;01:21:42;"What else?"
01:21:42;01:21:43;"-More spices,"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"a variety of spices."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"It's really an elevated version."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"-Right."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"-Zestier."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"-For sure, zestier, yeah."
01:21:50;01:21:52;"-So, like, maybe they decide"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"that, yeah, Pasquale's pizza"
01:21:54;01:21:55;"and wings, that works."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"They could also say,"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"""But you know what?"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"The oven's only at half capacity,"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"even with the Pasquale's orders."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"Why don't we create"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"a cut above Pasquale's"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"that's called, you know,"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"Neapolitan arcade or something?"""
01:22:08;01:22:10;"And at Neapolitan arcade,"

01:22:11;01:22:12;"The price point's a little bit"
01:22:12;01:22:13;"higher than Pasquale's,"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"but it's a really nice,"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"thin-crust pizza,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"and it has nicer cheese,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"and it's got bougier toppings."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Like, you get a prosciutto pizza there."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"And so then you open the app,"

01:22:25;01:22:26;"You're like, ""Nope. Pasquale's."""

01:25:43;01:25:45;"-Yes, exactly."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"-Maybe that's like Pesqually. Yeah, so I can imagine"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"somebody from Chuggy Cheese"

01:26:11;01:26:13;"It's Pesqually. Of course"

01:26:23;01:26:25;"Are you f***ing stupid?"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"-Yeah, don't blame Chuggy Cheese for your own ignorance."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"If you know Chuggy Cheese, you know Pesqually,"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"you know what he does. And you know"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"that there's no lie there. There's no untruth being told."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"-That's super like Kellyanne"

01:26:43;01:26:45;"that Pesqually is not"
01:26:45;01:26:47;"part of... I mean, you hear Pesqually,"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"you first think of Chuggy Cheese. Pesqually's"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"probably even more famous than Chuggy Cheese."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"Are you... Oh my god, you're..."" -Everyone knows"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"that Pesqually is the Bob Nostanovich"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"of the Chuggy Cheese band."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Everyone knows it."
01:26:59;01:27:03;"-Chuggy Cheese just hires"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"a few famous drummers"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"to kind of do a PSA to get them out of hot water."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Ringo is just like,"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"""Now listen, us drummers,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"we're the heartbeat of the whole band."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"And I can tell you, there are"
01:27:15;01:27:17;"many times that people would talk about"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"me as if I wasn't"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"at the same level as Paul and John,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"but you know, there's no Beatles without Ringo."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"And I gotta say, Pesqually,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"he's my brother."
01:27:27;01:27:29;"Peace and love."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Give Pesqually a chance."" -I think"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Pesqually, he's got two jobs, right?"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"He's making pizza and wings"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"and he's also drumming in a band."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"What's more relatable than that?"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"-Yeah. -Geek economy."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"Man of the people."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"-I also like, too, that they chose"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Pesqually because"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"in bands in the past, you know, when you think"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"of like, John Bonham or Keith Moon,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"there's this idea that the drummer"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"is this kind of like"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"party animal,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"less refined kind of character."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"You know, when you think of those real classic"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"rock bands, you know, driving their car"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"into the pool, partying harder,"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"you know? And I like the fact that"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"with Pesqually, they said, ""No, no, no."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"That stereotype of drummers"
01:28:11;01:28:13;"being the wild ones"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"of the group, that's very ignorant."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Pesqually, actually, when he goes"
01:28:17;01:28:19;"into the kitchen to make pizza, he makes"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"something more refined and elegant"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"than Chuck E. Cheese, the front man."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"-Yeah, he's like the Neil Peart."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"-Yeah, exactly. He's very bookish."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"And actually, by the way, Pesqually writes"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"the lyrics."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"[laughter]"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"-So, guys, Matt just shared me on"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"the Pesqually bio."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"And, you know, Pesqually's got actually quite a"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"backstory. His full name is Pesqually"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"P. Pieplate. And he's"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"from Naples, Italy. Shortly"
01:28:45;01:28:47;"after his birth, his parents, Priscilla"
01:28:47;01:28:49;"and Petro, immigrated to America"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"where they opened Pesqually's Pizza,"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"which they named after him."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"Just a little bit more, growing up,"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Pesqually isolated himself from sports"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"and other activities to study the art of pizza"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"making, hoping to one day"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"inherit his parents' store."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"He also taught his younger"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"sister, Paola,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"everything he learned about pizza."
01:29:09;01:29:11;"-Wait."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"This is so epic."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"-But also, did they create"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"this backstory last week?"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"-This is unbelievable."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"-Was this always part of"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Chuggy Cheese's lore? Or did they create this"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"entry last week to kind of explain why"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Pesqually's was"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"this online pizza? -I have an answer"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"for that. -Could you imagine"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"that they were thinking, ""Holy sh*t,"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"we gotta really backtrack here."""
01:29:35;01:29:37;"-We gotta paper over this."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"[laughter]"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"-I also just love the idea, too,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"of being like, to really emphasize"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"why Pesqually's is different"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"than Chuggy Cheese. And to be like, ""Listen,"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"Pesqually ended up"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"kinda coming into the fold"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"with the Chuggy Cheese crew and joining"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Munch's Make Believe band."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"That was as a drummer. But you gotta"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"understand something. Performing night after"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"night in this kind of corporate"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"American pizzeria environment,"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"that was really hard for an Italian"
01:30:05;01:30:07;"immigrant whose parents"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"made real Neapolitan pizza."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"So every night,"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"Pesqually, he's wailing away on the drums,"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"but he's looking out at these kids eating this"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"dog sh*t American pizza."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"And as an Italian, that was"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"painful for him on a cultural"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"level. And he always said"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"to Chuggy, ""Can't we make the pizza"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"a little bit better? I can't get down"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"with this sh*t."" Chuggy always brushed him aside."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"So the COVID-19"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"pandemic really allowed him"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"to finally have the time"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"away from drumming"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"to kinda get in the kitchen and"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"create a pizza that was up to his standards."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"And"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"listen, if any members"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"of the press are also Italian immigrants"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"with a story like that,"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"by all means, raise"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"your hand. But I think the rest"
01:30:53;01:30:55;"of us should probably check our privilege"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"and let Pesqually"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"do what he wants to do as"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"an immigrant drummer."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"- There's a dark side to Pesqually's story."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"- Oh, no. - After his"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"parents split up and settled in America,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"Pesqually gained full control"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"of their restaurant. Determined"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"to not only attract customers through"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"pizza, but also through entertainment,"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"he performed live stand-up comedy,"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"recruited his nephew, Gino, to help make"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"pizzas, and edit arcade games"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"as a mainstay. However, his plan"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"backfired due to the negative reception"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"of his jokes."
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Faced with a slow decline of customers,"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Pesqually intended to close"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"the restaurant, but a surprise encounter"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"with a singing mouse"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"began to bring in more customers,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"prompting Pesqually to"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"rename his restaurant ""Chucky Cheese's"""
01:31:41;01:31:43;"after his new star."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"And he and Chucky Cheese remained friends"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"ever since. - Oh, so he's the founder of"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Chucky Cheese's. - Pesqually's the brains of the operation."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"- Yeah. Chucky Cheese is just"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"the front man. - Okay, but it still stands that"
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Pesqually's an Italian immigrant"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"who links up with this American"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"guy, and then next thing you know,"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"they're this big mainstream"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"rock act and"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"children's pizza joint. Pesqually's"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"is kind of, if he was a musician, this is like his"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"Back to Basics album. You know, this is"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"Bono being like, ""Listen, at the end of the day,"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"we're just a couple Irish kids who love"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"punk rock, and this song is"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"dedicated to Joey Ramone."""
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Or the Rolling Stones being like, ""Listen,"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"we're just still those kids who love"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"collecting blues records."""
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Okay, so Pesqually's got an interesting story."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"- Can I also just sort of say something that's kind of"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"obvious, which is that this is psychotic."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"That there's"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"no story of"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"Pesqually. Like, there's no"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"TV show or anything."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"They literally had..."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"- Seinfeld, where are you reading this?"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"This is Wikipedia? - This is the"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Chuck E. Cheese fandom page."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"The sub-wiki of it."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"The entry under Pesqually."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"- I mean, I guess this"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"predates the whole scandal. I don't know. Well,"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"clearly, there's more than meets the eye"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"of the Chuck E. Cheese universe."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"And maybe it should have been called Pesqually's from the start."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"That's what it sounds like to me."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"Alright, should we bang out a top five?"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"- It's time for the Top"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"Five"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"on iTunes."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"- This week's"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"top five, we're comparing"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"the top five Billboard hits"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"this week in 1977"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"with the top five Apple Music"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"songs right now."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"2020. Why 1977?"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Is it because Jake and Kanye"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"were born that year?"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"No, I think you know why. But Jake,"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"tell them, in case they forgot."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"- I mean, we've been talking about it"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"for about an hour now. But Chuck E."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Cheese was founded in 1977"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"in San Jose, California."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"- As we go through these"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"hits of 1977, we can kind of"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"imagine that"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"we're watching the"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Leonardo DiCaprio,"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Nolan Bushnell biopic."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"And this is the soundtrack."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"So the number five song"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"this week in 1977, Marvin Gaye"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"got to give it up."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Let's take a listen."
01:34:01;01:34:05;"And I guess this is a live version."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Or maybe"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"this is kind of like a fake live version."
01:34:11;01:34:13;"- Right, it's like"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"""What's Going On"" had that sort of"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"synthetic, fake crowd."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"- This song was a response to a request from"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"his record label that he perform"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"disco music. - Right, kind of"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"disco, but such a good song."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"- Way more minimal than disco. - Yeah."
01:34:27;01:34:29;"And this is infamously the song that"
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Blurred Lines was"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"inspired by. And the Gaye"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"estate sued Robin Thicke and"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Pharrell and all those people."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"- What happened with that lawsuit?"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Who won that? - The Marvin Gaye"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"family did. - I mean, it's very similar."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"- It's similar, but"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"as I've said before, they're"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"different songs. At some point"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"you shouldn't be able to copyright buy."
01:34:53;01:34:57;"- I don't know any musicians"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"who really like that"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"decision, because I think people just felt"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"like, nobody's even defending"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Blurred Lines or anything, or being like"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"""No, Blurred Lines is original."" Because it's not"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"about that. You just don't want to be"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"in positions when"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"people play me sh*t all the time, like ""Yo, doesn't this"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"sound like Vampire Weekend, Sparta?"" And I've always"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"been kind of like, ""Eh,"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"maybe."" There's certain elements that"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"we maybe put together or something"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"that we didn't own in the first place."
01:35:23;01:35:25;"The idea that somebody does their... If they change it"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"enough, I kind of feel like if somebody"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"does something that's obviously"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"egregiously inspired by something"
01:35:31;01:35:33;"else, the price they should have to pay"
01:35:33;01:35:35;"is just kind of like embarrassment."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Like, where it's like, ""Alright,"
01:35:37;01:35:39;"I see what you're going for."" - You're doing like a pastiche."
01:35:39;01:35:41;"Yeah. - Sometimes when you listen"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"to two things, you're like, ""Oh, those are pretty similar."""
01:35:43;01:35:45;"But then, when they can't prove that"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"the melody's the same or the bassline's the"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"same, the thing that always"
01:35:49;01:35:51;"kind of kills it for me is when you actually see"
01:35:51;01:35:53;"the legal language. And I've seen"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"this for other lawsuits like this"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"where somebody will"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"describe what the infringement is."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"And so their lawyer has to put that into writing. And sometimes"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"it'll be like, ""Demix of repetitive"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"percussion,"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"distorted vocal sounds,"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"atmospheric keyboards, and"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"angular guitar."" They'll"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"describe s*** like that and be like, ""Yo, you're just describing"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"genres of music now."" So,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"I understand why. And I think they"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"were even on record as being like, ""Oh yeah, our song's inspired"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"by 'Got To Give It Up.' But it's like,"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"at a certain point, you're basically saying to somebody,"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"""It was my idea to use a"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"cowbell and minimalist"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"vibe on a song."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"It's a very slippery slope. It's a"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"bad vibe."" Great song, though. - The"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"craziest lawsuit ever was the"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"one that I remember being like, ""What"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"the hell? Was the George Harrison 'My"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"Sweet Lord'?"" Which he lost."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"- He took the whole melody and he admitted, he's like,"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"""Oh, damn. Oops. I forgot."""
01:36:45;01:36:47;"- But talk about different vibes."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"It was like '60s Motown"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"and then George's"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"'70s Hare Krishna"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"hippie music."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Totally different vibes. - And I think, yeah,"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"you could even argue that. To me,"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"I always grew up being like, ""Alright,"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"there's a certain length of melody"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"that once somebody makes that,"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"that's theirs. And if you copy that exact"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"same melody and chord progression,"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"you are entering this thing where it's the same"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"song."" I buy that, but"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"I'd be open to even a deeper interpretation."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"But I just think once you're describing"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"elements of music together,"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"you start to describe genres. And it's"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"like, that gets weird. That's"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"where you get into s***. You're like, ""Should Radiohead be"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"allowed to sue Muse?"""

01:38:03;01:38:05;"since his death. Wow."
01:38:05;01:38:13;"Sorry, who's the artist?"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"This is Polo G, but it's featuring"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Juice WRLD, who died."
01:38:17;01:38:19;"Polo G."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"I like the general vibe."
01:38:41;01:38:43;"In my situation, I can't get the lyrics in front of me right now,"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"which I think for new rap"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"usually is necessary"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"to dig a little deeper. But, solid."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Solid work from Polo G."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"Back to 77, the number four song."

01:40:07;01:40:09;"feeling like the f***ing man, 1977."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"So, it says here that"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"this song originally confused some radio"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"DJs due to the fact that in the"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"70s, Boogie Man was also a"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"common African-American racial slur."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"At least one DJ, Frankie Crocker"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"at WBLS in New York"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"canceled an interview with them upon"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"learning that they were white."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"They were actually an integrated band with Finch"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"and Casey, the only white members."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Huh, wow."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"So the DJ thought this major"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"hit had this"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"racial slur as the book?"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Maybe it's the type of slur that"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"at the time, it would"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"just really depend who it's coming from."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"Or what the vibe was. If he was like,"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"""Wait, these people are white?"" Maybe it felt"
01:40:56;01:40:58;"totally different or something. I'm not familiar with"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"the context of it. But"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"it was never clear to me if they were just kind of like"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"some"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"white dudes just like jumping on the"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"disco train and just kind of like doing"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"kind of watered down s***. But I guess it was"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"actually an integrated band."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"And they had like a lot of hits."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"Never a big fan. Wait, isn't there"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"another big song called Boogie Shoes?"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"Everybody's just obsessed with boogieing"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"in the 70s. Yeah, it's like..."
01:41:22;01:41:24;"I always liked that song because there was that big"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Mr. P song from back in the day"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"that sampled it. What is it called?"

01:41:32;01:41:34;"That's a good"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"sample. Gets people going."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Back to number four in 2020."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Our old friend Drake with"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"""Toosie Slide."""
01:41:42;01:41:44;"Oh wow, this is hanging tough."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"So this, as I recall, this is the song"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"about when Drake's got the gun in his fanny"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"pack and he's at the club"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"and he's kind of whispering to the"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"girl that he's got a gun."
01:41:54;01:41:58;"So I guess this song's doing"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"pretty well. It broke all"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"TikTok records. This"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"song did? Yeah. So"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Toosie is a social media"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Atlanta-based social media"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"influencer. And Toosie came up"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"with the moves. Okay, so that explains"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"what Toosie is. And Toosie revealed to"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"Rolling Stone how he created the viral moves with"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"fellow dancers High Key and Ayo and Tia."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Drake hit me up and was like, ""Yo, I need your help."""
01:42:20;01:42:22;"So he sends me the record. It was just"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"an idea at the time. It was just the hook and a verse."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"I came up with this dance. What do you"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"think? You think you'd come up with the dance for this"

01:42:30;01:42:32;"Isn't the hook the"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"dance? I'm a little confused"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"by this. Did Drake send"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"an actual dancer"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"a song where the hook was, ""It goes right foot"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"up, left foot slide?"" I guess you still have"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"to interpret that to figure out exactly how"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"to do it. Or maybe he didn't actually have the"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"hook and he just meant some other part of"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"the song. I like how 1950s"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"or early 60s it is."
01:42:52;01:42:54;"A song about a dance,"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"""Do the twist"" or ""The"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"Bristol Stomp."" What's interesting"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"about it is there's always been"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"dance songs like that, like"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"the ""Cha-Cha Slide"" or something."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"This is interesting in that,"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"and I guess you've got to give Drake some credit, in that"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"he's trying to... I mean, we talked about"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"this last time, that he's trying to"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"do a level above just"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"straight up the dance song. The verses"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"are not just more information"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"about... There's a really big one a few years ago"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"by that young dude named"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Silento. You remember that?"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"No. I think we listened to it on the show before,"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"but it was a huge thing. He basically was just"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"calling out dances. Now,"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"""Watch me whip, watch me nay nay,"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"watch me whip, whip,"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"watch me nay nay."" He"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"actually crossed my mind a few weeks ago and I looked him up"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"and I was like, ""I wonder what he's been up to?"" It's been a little"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"bit quiet for him, but that was one massive"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"song. And then you watch the video,"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"it's basically he's just naming"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"dances. And there's a long tradition of that."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"But what's interesting about this Drake song"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"is that maybe there's other hybrid"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"versions of this. I'm sure"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"I don't know all of them."
01:43:56;01:43:58;"But it is this interesting kind of hybrid"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"of being like, the hook is just the dance, but then"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"the verses are like regular rap and somehow"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"the song is not just about"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"dancing. It's like the dance is like a metaphor"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"for something. What did we say last time"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"that... Oh, I thought that this was"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"almost like, ""I'm going down."" Either way,"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"we're about to slide down into"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"depression. But I think he just meant"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"this is like his dance about"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"how it's time to leave the club."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"Yeah, yeah. He's got to slide."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"I mean, there's always a vibe"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"when Drake puts something out where"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"people are kind of just like, ""Drake finally"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"jumped the shark. It's over for him. He's no longer"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"the hit maker. He's not relevant"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"anymore."" And then you think, especially"
01:44:34;01:44:36;"this song, you're like, ""Toosie slide."""
01:44:36;01:44:38;"It's kind of light. It's like, everybody's"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"like, ""This is such TikTok bait. You're just trying"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"to get people to dance. It's kind of empty."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"And now is not the time for it."""
01:44:44;01:44:46;"And then the video that we talked about where he's"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"going through his insane Toronto"
01:44:48;01:44:50;"mansion, and you're just like, ""Drake, man,"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"the people are suffering. COVID-19 pandemic."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"This is wrong"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"on all levels. Nobody wants to see your big-ass"

01:45:02;01:45:04;"you hear it, and you're just like, ""Another classic"

01:45:06;01:45:08;"have thought he would have properly failed"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"by now. And I'm not saying that as a"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"hater. I just mean with all this negative energy"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"against him, you would have"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"thought that most artists go"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"through ebbs and flows, especially"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"artists who release lots and lots of music."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"When was his first big hit? What year?"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"Maybe 2009?"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Oh, geez. Wow."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"He's had a full decade of"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"unbroken winning."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Unbroken chain, dude. Drake might be"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"America's greatest rock band,"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"even though he's not American"
01:45:36;01:45:38;"nor a rock band."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"I'll put Drake against the Rolling Stones any day."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"The number three song"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"back in '77, ""Climax"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Blues Band,"" couldn't get it right."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Are you familiar with the ""Climax Blues Band,"""
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Jake? Yes, this is a good song."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"I'm not familiar with the band, really,"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"but I know this song."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Okay. Do you know this? I don't know."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"Time was drifting"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"This rock got to roll"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"So I hit the"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"road and made my getaway"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"I like this vibe, which to me"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"is like late '70s"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"hard rock funk. Yes."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"I started searching"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"for a better way"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"I kept on"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"looking for a sign in the middle of the night"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"But I couldn't see"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"the light. Oh, okay."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"I couldn't see the light. Now it sounds"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"familiar. I kept on looking for"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"a way to take me through the night"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Couldn't get it right"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"I feel like the next"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"verse starts with a lyric about New York City."
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Let's see if I'm right."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"LA fever"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Nope."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"What did he say? LA fever?"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Yeah."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Best of me. I guess this is a song"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"about touring."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"They said this song's about being on the road in"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"America, looking for a holiday"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"end. That's tight."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"I kept on"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"looking for a sign in the middle of the night"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"Looking for a sign in the middle of the night."
01:47:06;01:47:08;"And looking for that old holiday end sign."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"That's so awesome."
01:47:10;01:47:12;"I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Couldn't get it right"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"I couldn't get it right"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"What's going on there?"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"Sax guitar double?"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Doubling each other?"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"It just sounds like straight sax to me."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"New York City"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"And Lily died from"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Hospitality"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"That's pretty"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"pretty pop-colored."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Hospitality"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Good song."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"I like to think about them in the tour bus"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"as being like"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"coming up with that song on the fly"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"looking for a holiday end."
01:48:02;01:48:04;"And I couldn't see the light"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"I also like songs where"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"sometimes it seems like"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"it's some deep metaphor that you couldn't see the light"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"and then you're just like, what does the light represent?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Yeah, it's like"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"the ultimate wisdom of"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"coming face to face with your maker"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"and he's like, no man, it's like"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"the light of the old holiday end sign"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"when you drive around America"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"in real time"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"you're just like looking around"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"in the middle of the night, you see the light."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"So much cooler."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"The number three song"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"right now 2020"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Future, Solitaire"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"featuring Travis Scott"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"Future just put out a new album."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Wow, this new album is Future's"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"eighth studio LP."
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Damn."
01:48:52;01:48:54;"How many years do you think?"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"That's a good question."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"10 years? Yeah, 10 or less."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"He did release like two"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"back to back ones."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Alright, next time we do this"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"I gotta get the lyrics up because"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"that's my way in"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"for Future's song. But I do love this."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"According to Rolling Stone, Future was originally planning"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"to call the album Life Is Good"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"which I think is his song"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"with Drake, but he changed the title"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"at the last minute in response to the global health"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"crisis. I think it would have been"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"fine to call the album Life Is Good."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"So what did he change it to?"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"High Off Life."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"Okay."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"Kind of a lateral move."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Yeah, that does seem like a lateral move."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"I mean, I think calling an album Life Is Good"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"even during COVID, it's like"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"especially coming from"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"Future who's a rich famous guy but"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"he's known for being, sometimes having"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"a dark world view."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"I think he would intrinsically understand"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"that Life Is Good is like a loaded statement"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"from him. Like good in some ways,"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"bad in others. High Off Life."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"I like High Off Life too."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Back to 1977"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"Leo Sayer, When I Need You."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Oh, interesting."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"One of the songwriters on this is Albert Hammond."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"That's Albert Hammond Jr.'s"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"father from The Strokes."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Yep."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"Whoa, a lot of tea on this song."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Leonard Cohen sued them over"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"a piece of the melody of the chorus"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"that was similar to his song, Famous Blue Raincoat."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"And then Leonard Cohen said,"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"""Somebody sued them on my behalf."""
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Hmm."
01:50:30;01:50:34;"When I need you"
01:50:34;01:50:37;"Just close my eyes"
01:50:37;01:50:41;"And I'm with you"
01:50:41;01:50:45;"And all of that I so wanna give you"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Very slow BPM here."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"Okay, I hear the"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Famous Blue Raincoat thing, but"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"it is a very slow song."
01:50:53;01:50:57;"When I need love"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"I hold out my hands"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"And I touch love"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"I feel like I can hear"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"the Albert Hammond in this."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"He really wrote some"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"powerful ballads."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"Now,"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"he wrote The Air That I Breathe,"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"and correct me if I'm wrong,"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"did Radiohead get sued?"
01:51:17;01:51:19;"Yes. I don't know if it was him or the publisher,"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"but The Air That I Breathe by The Hollies,"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"they sued"
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Radiohead over Creep."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"And actually, if you look up Creep right now,"
01:51:27;01:51:29;"Albert Hammond"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"is credited as one of the writers of Creep."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Wow."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"It has the same chord progression,"
01:51:35;01:51:37;"which is kind of notable, the way it goes to this"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"major three, but they specifically"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"sued over Tom York's"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"bridge melody."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"It basically is The Air That I Breathe."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Da, na, na, na, na, na, na."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"Which is the verse"
01:51:49;01:51:51;"of The Air That I Breathe."
01:51:53;01:51:55;"The air that I breathe"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"Bees came up on me"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"And their bees"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"Made me breathe"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"Although, you know, once you have the same chord progression,"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"it's natural that different minds"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"might go to some of the same places"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"in the scale. I feel like that's"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"the same chord progression as ""Lay, Lady, Lay"""
01:52:21;01:52:23;"too. ""Lay, Lady, Lay."""
01:52:23;01:52:25;"It's like A, C-sharp,"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"major, D, right? Right."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"Yeah, the major third. Yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"It's a classic move, because it's outside the key."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"It's surprising a little bit."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"It's like a nice moment to get that major third,"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"because you expect a minor third, kind of."
01:52:37;01:52:39;"Yeah. The number two song"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"in 2020"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"is another Future song called ""Trillionaire,"""
01:52:43;01:52:45;"featuring Youngboy, ""Never Broke Again."""
01:52:45;01:52:47;"I was so high on my mind"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"I thought I wasn't gonna see tomorrow"
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Interestingly, there's"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"just a news article projecting that Jeff Bezos"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"is gonna become the world's first trillionaire."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"Brutal."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Around 2026."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"So I don't know if Future knew about that"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"when he wrote this song, and this is kind of a"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"congratulations to Jeff Bezos."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"What the hell is Bezos doing, man?"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Yeah, it's bad vibe."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Give it away, man."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"Give it away now."
01:53:13;01:53:15;"It's not cool."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"Give it away, give it away, give it away now."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"No one's gonna think"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"that's cool."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"I'm just thinking what a power move"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"it would be for one of the"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"truly iconic rappers of our era"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"to, you know,"
01:53:29;01:53:31;"like on a Future album, be like,"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"""Who are the Futures on your album?"""
01:53:33;01:53:35;"You know, ""B.I.L.E."", you know, ""Got Drake,"""

01:53:37;01:53:39;"all these different names,"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"and be like, and then actually, you know what?"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"On track 14, there's actually an Anthony Kiedis"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"feature. And people would be like,"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"""Anthony Kiedis from the Chili Peppers?"""
01:53:47;01:53:49;"And be like, ""Look at his Wikipedia page, man."

01:53:51;01:53:53;"Be like, ""Yeah, I guess you could put it that way."""
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Just like Anthony Kiedis coming in"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"on the second verse of this song,"
01:53:57;01:53:59;"that'd be so sick."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"That would be very sick. For some reason,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"I thought you were going to say a Jeff Bezos"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"type on, but that's where I thought you were"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"going to."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Future featuring"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"Anthony Kiedis and Jeff Bezos."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Oh my god. Bezos, just desperate"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"street cred."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do like a spoken word"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"thing on your track."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Jeff Pesos?"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Oh yeah. I'm sure there"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"will be somebody, a rapper,"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"a musician, somebody called Jeff Pesos"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"at some point. Or at the very"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"least, somebody will have a line"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"about like, maybe somebody talking"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"about how they're broke. ""I'm not Jeff Bezos."
01:54:35;01:54:37;"I've got five pesos."""
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Or I guess you could also say, ""I've got pesos"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"like Bezos,"" because Jeff Bezos has"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"a lot of pesos. It's not a great"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"rhyme."
01:54:45;01:54:47;"I don't think Future actually is shouting out Jeff"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Bezos. I wonder how many rappers"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"are actually shouting"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"out Jeff Bezos, because"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"obviously in rap, there's a long tradition,"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"and in all types of music,"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"of kind of valorizing"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"the gangsters from previous eras."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"You know,"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky,"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"whoever, there's this"

01:55:09;01:55:11;"with gangster movies,"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"because even though some of these people are kind of"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"bad dudes, there's still some"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"understanding that there's something a little"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"bit honorable about"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"being like, ""F*** the system."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Take care of the family."""
01:55:23;01:55:25;"There's a reason that we all love gangster"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"movies, and that they don't always feel like"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"pure villains. It's that new, weird"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"America, where a land of"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"hucksters and hustlers, it's like"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"in a way,"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"even a gangster is playing by the rules."

02:02:31;02:02:33;"Well, I think this is a very good song."
02:02:33;02:02:35;"The only disappointing thing is that"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"it's called Rockstar, and you hear it from the first note"
02:02:37;02:02:39;"it's a guitar. It's not really a rock guitar."
02:02:39;02:02:41;"It's kind of like, it sounds like a"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"Spanish nylon. I mean, I'm listening through earbuds."
02:02:43;02:02:45;"It kind of sounds more like, yes,"
02:02:45;02:02:47;"a Spanish nylon guitar."
02:02:47;02:02:49;"I associate that sound more with obviously"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"Spanish music and also"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"90s R&B."
02:02:53;02:02:55;"It would be very easy for them to remix the song"

02:02:57;02:02:59;"mellow, sweet"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"Spanish acoustic sound"
02:03:01;02:03:03;"with kind of an overdriven,"
02:03:03;02:03:05;"more like Eddie Van Halen tone."
02:03:05;02:03:07;"[imitates Eddie Van Halen tone]"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"On those arpeggios, that would make it a little more rock."
02:03:09;02:03:11;"That'd be very cool."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"The producer's name is Seth in the Kitchen."
02:03:13;02:03:15;"All one word."
02:03:15;02:03:17;"I wonder what Seth in the Kitchen's backstory is."
02:03:17;02:03:19;"Nickelback had a song called"
02:03:19;02:03:21;"Rockstar, too."
02:03:21;02:03:23;"Wow. Was that like a hit?"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"Single? That was a big song."
02:03:25;02:03:27;"It's funny. In the 20 years"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"since rock entered its"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"kind of Borghese and post-modern"
02:03:31;02:03:33;"death knell period, there's"
02:03:33;02:03:35;"been a lot of hit songs called"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"Rockstar, many of which"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"are by rock bands,"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"except for Nickelback. Even they are"
02:03:41;02:03:43;"controversial in the rock community."
02:03:43;02:03:45;"You ever consider this? That maybe rock"
02:03:45;02:03:47;"is not played out,"
02:03:47;02:03:49;"but it is dead. You know what I mean?"
02:03:49;02:03:51;"They're just putting the"
02:03:51;02:03:53;"EKG electric"
02:03:53;02:03:55;"thing on the chest."
02:03:55;02:03:57;"It's like Marilyn Monroe's dead,"
02:03:57;02:03:59;"but she's still..."
02:03:59;02:04:01;"Apparently her estate generates hundreds of millions"
02:04:01;02:04:03;"of dollars a year because she's such an iconic"
02:04:03;02:04:05;"figure. People want to buy stuff."
02:04:05;02:04:07;"Elvis is dead, but he's"
02:04:07;02:04:09;"not played out. Alexander"
02:04:09;02:04:11;"Hamilton is dead. There's a hit Broadway musical"
02:04:11;02:04:13;"about him. Maybe rock did"
02:04:13;02:04:15;"die, but it's actually not"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"as played out as people think. Or maybe it"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"is played out, but it's not dead."
02:04:19;02:04:21;"And that's what you have to tell rock"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"fans. It's like, ""Listen, guys."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"It's true what you've heard. Rock is played out, but it's"
02:04:25;02:04:27;"not dead. It's alive. It's just..."
02:04:27;02:04:29;"It just ain't pretty."""
02:04:29;02:04:31;"Maybe that's when people got to face the facts."
02:04:31;02:04:33;"Anyway,"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"this is a good place to wrap it up."
02:04:35;02:04:37;"Finally got back to the top five. Shout out to"
