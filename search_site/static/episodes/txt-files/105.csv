00:00;00:03;">> Time Crisis back once again."
00:03;00:09;"On this episode, we dig deep on the relationship between the Trump family and Jam Bands."
00:09;00:14;"We also talk about Morrissey and his unusual merchandise."
00:14;00:20;"All that plus Beto, Bernie, and the top hits of 1972."
00:20;00:22;"This is a very special-"
00:22;00:26;">> Time Crisis with Ed's Rump King."
00:26;00:30;">> Peaceful World."
01:00;01:16;">> Time Crisis back once again."
01:16;01:20;">> Well, Jake, we find ourselves once again in the true time crisis."
01:20;01:24;"We banked an app because we both had to leave town."
01:24;01:26;"We both had to split."
01:26;01:29;"And then we came back again later to bank another app."
01:29;01:34;"But in the time that passed between the first banked app and this banked app that we're here to record,"
01:34;01:36;"some things changed in the world."
01:36;01:38;"So we're just going to give a heads up to the listeners."
01:38;01:42;"In this episode, we talk a lot about the Beto O'Rourke campaign."
01:42;01:44;">> This is very sensitive."
01:44;01:45;">> This is very sensitive."
01:45;01:50;"In this episode, we talked about the Beto O'Rourke campaign and some of the e-mails they were sending out."
01:50;01:54;"Since the time that we recorded it, Beto has ended his campaign."
01:54;01:56;"And look, as far as I'm concerned, it's a good thing."
01:56;01:57;">> It's a strong choice."
01:58;02:01;"And I have a feeling that now you've got a little more time to think,"
02:01;02:04;"and you'll figure out ways that you can help the eventual nominee."
02:04;02:07;"Or you say you're not going to run for Senate in Texas."
02:07;02:10;"That's cool, but I'm sure you can figure out all sorts of great things to do in Texas."
02:10;02:14;"But anyway, just when our listeners are listening to this episode,"
02:14;02:16;"and they hear us start to talk about the Beto campaign,"
02:16;02:20;"you've got to understand that at the time, it was a living, breathing campaign."
02:20;02:21;">> He was polling at 1%."
02:21;02:23;">> He was polling at 1%, but he was still in there."
02:23;02:24;">> Yeah, man."
02:24;02:25;">> And now he's gone."
02:25;02:28;">> Gone, he's gone."
02:28;02:30;">> So anyway, that was just a little bit of a heads up."
02:30;02:34;"And, you know, that's what happens with live streaming radio, live streaming banked-up radio."
02:34;02:35;"A true time crisis."
02:35;02:36;"So anyway, shout out to Beto O'Rourke."
02:36;02:38;"Strong choice, dropping out."
02:38;02:41;"I think you're in a way better position now to do some meaningful stuff."
02:41;02:42;">> Start a band, dude."
02:42;02:47;">> Yeah, my cousin Benji Sarlin, who works for NBC News, he's a political pundit,"
02:47;02:50;"he tweeted, ""In all seriousness, Beto should start a band."""
02:50;02:54;"But anyway, that's enough Beto talk from this moment."
02:54;03:00;"Now we're going to return to the beginning of the time crisis episode that was supposed to air"
03:00;03:03;"in an alternate universe where Beto's campaign had not ended yet."
03:03;03:05;">> Time Crisis."
03:05;03:08;">> This is a real time crisis original flavor."
03:08;03:09;">> Original lineup."
03:09;03:13;">> Just the core crew."
03:13;03:14;"No fancy guests."
03:14;03:15;">> No."
03:15;03:16;">> No even friends of the show."
03:16;03:17;"Just the boys."
03:17;03:20;">> Starting lineup."
03:20;03:21;">> For the first time."
03:21;03:23;"Almost in two months."
03:23;03:24;">> Yeah."
03:24;03:25;"It feels great."
03:25;03:26;">> Yeah."
03:26;03:30;"Just don't have to do any research about, you don't have to look at anybody's Wikipedia page."
03:30;03:32;"Just fly by the seat of our pants."
03:32;03:34;"Well, what should we talk about?"
03:34;03:37;"By this point, I think I'm probably on tour in Europe."
03:37;03:38;">> Right."
03:38;03:39;">> Because you're going to Europe too."
03:39;03:40;">> Yeah."
03:40;03:41;">> We're almost going to cross over."
03:41;03:43;">> I'm going for personal reasons."
03:43;03:44;">> Yeah."
03:44;03:45;">> Pleasure, not business."
03:45;03:46;">> Is it a pleasure trip?"
03:46;03:47;">> Yeah, it's pleasure."
03:47;03:48;">> No business whatsoever?"
03:48;03:49;">> None."
03:49;03:51;">> When you come back to the U.S., what was the purpose of your trip?"
03:51;03:52;"Pleasure, sir."
03:52;03:53;">> Pure pleasure."
03:54;03:58;">> Pleasure is such a funny word for that context."
03:58;04:01;"It's not like recreation or vacation."
04:01;04:02;"Pleasure is very sensual."
04:02;04:04;">> Yeah, it sounds like sex tourism."
04:04;04:07;"Traveling for pleasure is a euphemism for sex tourism."
04:07;04:08;">> Delectable cuisine."
04:08;04:15;">> Oh, man, that must be such a weird job being like a customs agent or a homeland security dude on the way back."
04:15;04:19;"Because on the one hand, you got all these stressed out, tired people."
04:19;04:24;"But then you probably also have the occasional person who's just really jazzed on the trip they just took."
04:24;04:25;">> I'm feeling great, man."
04:25;04:28;">> I've definitely seen people like chopping it up before."
04:28;04:30;">> Yeah, that seems like a tough nut to crack, though."
04:30;04:35;">> Well, I've just seen people be like -- yeah, like get back, be like, ""Oh, man."
04:35;04:36;"Oh, yeah, how was it over there?"
04:36;04:37;"Yeah, I don't know."
04:37;04:39;"I've seen -- it hasn't happened to me very often."
04:39;04:40;">> I'm going to try."
04:40;04:42;">> To chop it up with the agent."
04:42;04:43;">> Yeah."
04:43;04:44;">> When also you talk to the people on the other side."
04:44;04:45;">> Yeah."
04:45;04:46;">> When you get there."
04:46;04:47;"So you'll be traveling."
04:47;04:49;"When's the last time you were in Europe?"
04:49;04:50;"Oh, yeah, it was Italy?"
04:50;04:51;">> Well, yeah, look at me."
04:51;04:53;">> We talked about this on the show."
04:53;04:55;">> Globetrotter over here."
04:55;05:00;"I hadn't been to Europe in about like, I don't know, like 15 or 18 years."
05:00;05:02;"And then I went last year to Italy."
05:02;05:03;">> I feel like we talked about that in that episode."
05:03;05:05;"That was basically your honeymoon."
05:05;05:06;">> Yep."
05:06;05:07;">> You were cycling around Italy."
05:07;05:09;">> Yes, for part of the trip."
05:09;05:10;"And Hannah and I both fell."
05:10;05:11;">> Crazy."
05:11;05:13;">> I have a small scar on my knee."
05:13;05:14;">> Really?"
05:14;05:15;">> Oh, yeah."
05:15;05:19;">> I guess your matching scars are kind of like matching tattoos that some married couples get."
05:19;05:20;">> Love that."
05:20;05:22;">> Always remember."
05:22;05:26;"Yeah, I feel like we talked about that last time that you hadn't -- not only had you not been to Europe,"
05:26;05:29;"you hadn't, like, left the country in a really long time."
05:29;05:31;"Had you not left the country in a decade or am I forgetting something?"
05:31;05:32;">> Well --"
05:32;05:34;">> Or you'd been down Mexico way, something like that?"
05:34;05:37;">> No, I haven't been -- oh, no, I went there a few years ago."
05:37;05:38;"You know what it was?"
05:38;05:42;"When we started the show back in 2015, I think, yeah."
05:42;05:43;">> Sounds right."
05:43;05:50;">> I went to China in 2015, and that was the first time I had been out of the country in about 14 years."
05:50;05:52;">> And that was for a business trip."
05:52;05:53;">> That was business."
05:53;05:55;">> That was painterly business."
05:55;05:56;">> Exhibition in Beijing."
05:56;05:58;"Sounds very fancy."
05:58;06:00;">> Sir, what were you doing over there in China?"
06:00;06:02;"What were you doing down China way?"
06:02;06:04;">> Painter's business, sir."
06:04;06:05;">> All right."
06:05;06:06;"Fine art?"
06:06;06:11;">> I was there for painting business, and I'll tell you, brother, business is a-boomin'."
06:11;06:40;"[ Music ]"
06:40;06:50;"[ Music ]"
06:50;07:11;"[ Music ]"
07:11;07:13;">> So since 2015, I've really been a globetrotter."
07:13;07:18;"I went to Mexico once, Italy, Canada quite a few times this past year."
07:18;07:19;">> Oh, yeah, Calgary."
07:19;07:20;">> Spain."
07:20;07:21;">> So that's pretty hardcore."
07:21;07:23;"For 14 years, you were all American."
07:23;07:28;"You were bleeding red, white, and blue, not leaving our country, and now you're all over the place."
07:28;07:30;"Did the travel bug bite you?"
07:30;07:31;">> Hmm, I'm not sure about that."
07:31;07:33;"I think it's more circumstantial."
07:33;07:37;"Combination of business and my wife's interests."
07:37;07:39;"[ Laughter ]"
07:39;07:41;">> I'm here with the wife."
07:41;07:43;"[ Laughter ]"
07:43;07:46;"Yeah, it's too bad that we're not going to link up."
07:46;07:48;"Got a couple big shows in London."
07:48;07:49;">> Right."
07:49;07:52;">> I actually had a thought recently when I was thinking about set list."
07:52;07:59;"I don't think we should actually do this, but I think the next time to really bust out Mountain Brews,"
07:59;08:04;"which currently Vampire Wiggins is done once, Night 2 at Red Rocks, I was thinking, like, okay,"
08:04;08:10;"I definitely want to do it a lot when we do our mountain run with Twiddle next year when we're, you know, in Boise and Missoula."
08:10;08:15;"And it's not technically mountain time, but we could throw in Bend, Oregon, because it's part of the same run."
08:15;08:17;"It feels appropriate."
08:17;08:22;"But then I don't know if it would go down well, but I had this thought, like, if we dropped it in one, like, super random place,"
08:22;08:24;"and I was just thinking, like, Paris."
08:24;08:26;">> I would encourage it."
08:26;08:29;">> I guess I'd have to just really memorize the whole speech in French."
08:29;08:32;"Madame, madame et messieurs."
08:32;08:34;"Time in French is temps."
08:34;08:39;"T-E-M-P-S, temps de montagne, I think."
08:39;08:41;"Ah, my accent is so terrible now."
08:41;08:43;"I studied it for five years."
08:43;08:47;"Montagne, brew, beer is beer, I think."
08:47;08:48;">> Brew."
08:49;08:51;"Oh, yeah, yeah, brew de montagne."
08:51;08:53;"Yeah, I wouldn't be talking about mountain time."
08:53;08:59;"I learned one sentence in Spanish to drop in Monterrey when we were down there."
08:59;09:00;"Some people helped me out."
09:00;09:07;"Because I thought it was worth noting that the first time VW ever came to Mexico, we played in Monterrey."
09:07;09:11;"So I thought it was, like, cool to let, like, when we were playing in that city again, to let everybody know,"
09:11;09:14;"like, the first time we came to this great country, we played in Monterrey."
09:14;09:15;">> Man, I already forgot it."
09:15;09:19;"But it was, like, la primera vez que -- I already forgot it."
09:19;09:20;">> The first time --"
09:20;09:22;">> Do you speak -- how's your Spanish?"
09:22;09:23;">> How's your Spanish?"
09:23;09:24;">> Weak."
09:24;09:25;">> Weak?"
09:25;09:26;">> But I did take it for years."
09:26;09:27;">> Okay."
09:27;09:28;"La primera -- is it primera?"
09:28;09:34;"La primera vez que toqué en México fue Monterrey."
09:34;09:36;">> The first time we played in Mexico, we went to Monterrey."
09:36;09:37;">> Yeah."
09:37;09:38;">> Love it."
09:38;09:40;">> And then this comedian that I met down there --"
09:40;09:41;">> Toque, dude."
09:41;09:49;">> La primera vez que toqué en Mexico fue Monterrey."
09:49;09:51;">> Fue Monterrey, dude."
09:51;09:53;">> Que toque."
09:53;09:54;"Que toque is a good --"
09:54;09:56;">> Yo tengo hombre."
09:56;09:58;">> Yeah, I don't know how good my pronunciation is."
09:58;10:02;"I mean, I do love how people from there, they rolled R on Monterrey."
10:02;10:03;"Monterrey."
10:03;10:07;"I'm sure that sounds really awkward when I do it, but I try because I think it sounds cool."
10:07;10:12;"And then I was talking to a bunch of people, including this Mexican comedian named Richie O'Farrell."
10:12;10:16;"We did kind of like an episode of like a YouTube series that he does."
10:16;10:19;"He took me to like a dope old-school churro spot in Mexico City."
10:19;10:23;"But he was also at the festival in Monterrey, and I was like, he's from Mexico City, but I was just asking him generally,"
10:23;10:25;"like, is there anything good to say to get the crowd from you?"
10:25;10:28;"He's like, well, up here, you could say, ""Sacen la carnita asada."""
10:28;10:29;"And I was like, what does that mean?"
10:29;10:31;"I think it basically means like bring out the meat."
10:31;10:33;"Bring out the carne asada."
10:33;10:34;">> Bring out the meat."
10:34;10:36;">> Yeah, sacen."
10:36;10:37;"I don't even know how it's spelled."
10:37;10:38;"Maybe S-A-Q."
10:38;10:40;"Everybody's reached the limit of their Spanish here."
10:40;10:41;">> Sacar."
10:41;10:42;"I remember the verb, sacar."
10:42;10:43;"I just don't."
10:43;10:45;">> Sacar means to."
10:45;10:46;">> Bring, maybe?"
10:46;10:47;">> Maybe it's to bring."
10:47;10:49;"Maybe it just meant, it means bring out the carne asada."
10:49;10:50;">> Bring out the meat."
10:50;10:52;">> I think it just means a little bit like let's get this party started."
10:52;10:53;">> Right."
10:53;10:54;">> You know?"
10:54;10:55;">> That's a cool expression."
10:55;10:56;">> But he was very clear about one thing."
10:56;10:58;"He said, don't say this in Mexico City."
10:58;11:00;"This is a Monterrey thing."
11:00;11:02;"Sacen la carnita asada."
11:02;11:06;"And then when I was down in Mexico, people offered some more complicated versions of"
11:06;11:08;"what might play in Mexico City."
11:08;11:10;"Something more about like tacos or something."
11:10;11:13;"Oh, and then the other thing everybody told me to say, which I think just means like we"
11:13;11:17;"love you guys, which is something I would say in English at a show, so I was happy to"
11:17;11:20;"learn it, is los amo, cabrones."
11:20;11:21;">> Tight, man."
11:21;11:23;"You're like Beto O'Rourke up there, man."
11:23;11:26;">> Yeah, basically."
11:26;11:28;"Beto O'Rourke of indie."
11:28;11:33;"[ Music ]"
12:33;12:37;">> You know, we haven't talked politics in a long time in this show."
12:37;12:39;"Look, Beto seems like a nice guy."
12:39;12:41;"And we've talked about his emails before on the show, right?"
12:41;12:45;"We talked about his kind of infamous short story email that he just sent out that was"
12:45;12:49;"just like out of nowhere, just like, the kids are watching Last of the Mohicans."
12:49;12:51;"My coffee's bitter, but it's good."
12:51;12:55;"And just like dropping the names of everybody in his family as if we already know who they"
12:55;12:56;"are."
12:56;12:57;">> And like the dogs."
12:57;13:00;">> And like the dogs, Owen and Artemis, are running around outside."
13:00;13:04;"So I've always been interested in his emails, so I don't mean to beat up on the guy, but"
13:04;13:09;"A, I gave money to his campaign for Senate, like a lot of people."
13:09;13:10;">> Yep."
13:10;13:15;">> I'm a classic coastal leftist who wanted to send some of my coastal money deep into"
13:15;13:20;"the heart of Texas to make Ted Cruz lose."
13:20;13:25;"I think most people could agree Ted Cruz is not good for America."
13:25;13:27;"Beto seemed like a chill dude."
13:27;13:32;"I was charmed by the fact that he used to be in a band with some of the At The Drive-In"
13:32;13:33;"guys."
13:33;13:37;"And so I gave money to it, but there was something about just transferring from supporting somebody's"
13:37;13:39;"Senate campaign to the presidential campaign."
13:39;13:40;"It just snuck up on me."
13:40;13:43;"I'm like, I'm used to getting emails from his campaign, then suddenly it's about running"
13:43;13:44;"for president."
13:44;13:47;"And I'm just like, yeah, I wasn't consulted on this, man."
13:47;13:48;">> Bait and switch."
13:48;13:50;">> I'm not gonna give money to your presidential campaign."
13:50;13:52;"I don't see the point."
13:52;13:56;"But his presidential campaign emails, they've just gotten progressively darker."
13:56;13:58;">> I love that you still read them."
13:58;13:59;">> Well, now I have this interest."
13:59;14:00;">> Yeah."
14:00;14:04;">> To the Beto campaign's credit and to a lot of the campaigns, they know how to get you"
14:04;14:05;"to click."
14:05;14:06;"In fact, I got one recently."
14:06;14:10;"I can't even remember everybody that I gave money to recently, but there's a guy running"
14:10;14:13;"against a Republican in California."
14:13;14:16;"Okay, his name's Amar Kampa Najjar."
14:16;14:22;"And he's running to defeat Republican Duncan Hunter, who was recently indicted for fraud."
14:22;14:26;"So look, I'm sure I read something that I was like, man, we gotta help this dude, Amar"
14:26;14:28;"Kampa Najjar beat Duncan Hunter."
14:28;14:33;"So I gave some money and then they're always asking for more money, which that's how it"
14:33;14:34;"works."
14:34;14:35;"They need it."
14:35;14:36;"I don't knock them."
14:36;14:38;"But the last email I got, and this was effective."
14:38;14:40;"It made me just kick in a little more money."
14:40;14:44;"The last email I got from the Amar Kampa Najjar campaign just said, goodbye, Ezra."
14:44;14:47;"And then I, so I was like, damn, I was like, what's this one about?"
14:47;14:50;"And then I thought like, is this campaign ending?"
14:50;14:52;"Did I do something to offend them?"
14:52;14:56;"And then I click on it and just like, Ezra, our race reached a boiling point."
14:56;14:57;"Like throw down."
14:57;14:58;"I get it."
14:58;15:00;"Well, it says, midnight deadline tonight."
15:00;15:01;"Yeah."
15:01;15:02;"But I was just like the goodbye Ezra."
15:02;15:03;"Yeah, that's strong."
15:03;15:05;"It's also funny when they use your name and stuff."
15:05;15:08;"So anyway, Beto, this is one that I sent to the thread."
15:08;15:10;"Cause I was like, this one's just hilarious."
15:10;15:15;"And I think part of my issue, why I'm okay with a little gentle ribbing towards Beto,"
15:15;15:20;"not cause I think he's a bad guy, but because I don't know why so many people are running."
15:20;15:24;"Look, we could narrow it down to four people and you'd have basically your bases covered."
15:24;15:25;"And there's something about Beto."
15:25;15:30;"There's a part of me that's a little bit annoyed that he's not using all that goodwill to really change things in Texas."
15:30;15:32;"This just, this presidential run seems pointless."
15:32;15:35;"So there's a couple emails that I got from him recently."
15:35;15:38;"And I'm sure we have some listeners who probably also have contributed money to Beto."
15:38;15:42;"Maybe they're even team Beto, but they could still admit these are kind of funny emails to get."
15:42;15:46;"One was subject line, game-changing news from NBC."
15:46;15:51;"I'm like, all right, you have, you have my curiosity."
15:51;15:54;"So I click, what is this game-changing news?"
15:54;15:58;"Is it going to say, you know, turns out Beto was actually polling higher than Joe Biden."
15:58;16:00;"You know, turns out like blah, blah."
16:00;16:03;"And this is what it said, Ezra, we wanted to make sure you saw this."
16:03;16:05;"And then there's a quote from NBC news."
16:05;16:10;"Only 9% of all Democratic respondents say their minds are definitely made up."
16:10;16:12;"And then it goes on to say, this is game-changing news."
16:12;16:15;"It means the race is absolutely wide open."
16:15;16:23;"And just to break this down for a second, the first thing I thought of was Dumb and Dumber, where I believe, what's the dialogue?"
16:23;16:27;"Jim Carrey, he's asking a woman, what's the chance you would ever like go out with me?"
16:27;16:29;"And she says, I don't know, one in a million."
16:29;16:31;"And he goes, so you're saying there's a chance."
16:31;16:35;"It's an iconic line of 90s cinema."
16:35;16:39;"I don't know how that movie holds up for our younger listeners, but, you know, that was a big movie."
16:39;16:40;"It's a great line."
16:40;16:43;"That was kind of like Joker for, you know, in the 90s."
16:43;16:46;"But yeah, so you're saying there's a chance."
16:46;16:50;"Just like, you know, it's a great line because it sums up the epitome of somebody who just doesn't get it."
16:50;16:54;"Who looks for the bright side, even when there truly is no bright side."
16:54;16:57;"So when I see this, it's not the game-changing news was not Beto has a chance."
16:57;17:00;"It basically was they asked a bunch of Democrats, who do you want to vote for?"
17:00;17:02;"And almost everybody said not Beto."
17:02;17:05;"And then the second question was, but is your mind definitely made up?"
17:05;17:08;"And 91% people said, I guess not."
17:08;17:11;"And then Beto's team saw this and goes, so you're saying there's a chance."
17:11;17:12;"I just love that too."
17:12;17:14;"Just like we're polling at 1%."
17:14;17:24;"We're clearly don't seem to be offering anything that Bernie, Warren, Biden, Kamala, Andrew Yang, everybody's polling better."
17:24;17:25;"Tom Steyer, you know."
17:25;17:29;"Plus we're on stage in Ohio talking about confiscating guns."
17:29;17:34;"I mean, look, if that fired up the base, it'd be one thing, but I don't think it particularly did."
17:34;17:36;"So I saw this and I was like, what is going on over there, man?"
17:36;17:41;"And then the next email that the campaign sent out, subject line, Amy Klobuchar."
17:41;17:42;"Like, that's it."
17:42;17:43;"That's a sick subject line."
17:43;17:44;"Yeah."
17:44;17:46;"Just somebody else who's running for president."
17:46;17:48;"And then this is the opening."
17:48;17:56;"Ezra, this morning, Amy Klobuchar locked down her final requirement and officially qualified for the November Democratic debate."
17:56;17:58;"Amy effing Klobuchar."
17:58;18:01;"And then in bold, Beto still hasn't qualified."
18:01;18:05;"Like, oh man."
18:05;18:08;"You know, it's one thing when people are like, yeah, we're trying to hit our SEC."
18:08;18:10;"What is our filing deadline?"
18:10;18:11;"And we've done a lot."
18:11;18:16;"It's another thing where somebody, the vibe of just like Amy Klobuchar, are you f***ing kidding me?"
18:16;18:18;"So I found that one kind of like sad."
18:18;18:21;"And this is the one that the team sent out today."
18:21;18:22;"This is the subject line."
18:22;18:24;"Even Tom Steyer."
18:24;18:25;"Oh my God."
18:25;18:28;"It's like even Tom Steyer."
18:28;18:30;"And then Beto, open it."
18:30;18:31;"Take a look at this, Ezra."
18:31;18:36;"Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight website is reporting that nine candidates have officially made the November Democratic debate."
18:36;18:40;"Here is who will be on the debate stage when millions tune in and who has some more work to do."
18:40;18:47;"And then it says Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar."
18:47;18:49;"And there's a check next to each of their names."
18:49;18:50;"And then it says Beto O'Rourke."
18:50;18:51;"Nothing."
18:51;18:53;"Rough stuff."
18:53;18:58;"I just feel like a lot of people have this feeling like Beto, like you're our guy in Texas, man."
18:58;18:59;"Make a difference down there."
18:59;19:04;"And then he keeps sending out these emails that are just like it's kind of seeming like nobody wants me to be president."
19:04;19:05;"Is he trying to drum up sympathy?"
19:05;19:06;"I guess."
19:06;19:07;"That's like not the way to do it."
19:07;19:12;"I mean, that's not the right set of emotions that you look for in a candidate."
19:12;19:14;"Like I feel sorry for this guy."
19:14;19:16;"Yeah, I mean, but you're so right."
19:16;19:18;"I'm going to give him some money because I just feel bad for the dude."
19:18;19:21;"But that vibe of Amy f***ing Klobuchar."
19:21;19:23;"Even Tom Steyer."
19:25;19:26;"You know what that makes me think of?"
19:26;19:28;"Tom Steyer is real deep."
19:28;19:29;"That is so deep."
19:29;19:30;"I can understand him."
19:30;19:31;"Who is like."
19:31;19:37;"That sounds like something you say to your campaign manager when you're throwing a Jimmy John's sandwich against the wall."
19:37;19:39;"Flipping a folding table."
19:39;19:41;"You're at a truck stop in Iowa."
19:41;19:47;"Just throwing a Jimmy John's down on the ground and going, even Tom Steyer."
19:47;19:49;"I don't know why you bring that out to everyone."
19:49;19:53;"Yeah, it kind of makes me think of that Tom Petty song."
19:53;19:56;"Even the losers."
19:56;19:58;"Even Tom Steyer."
19:58;20:01;"Even Tom Steyer gets lucky sometimes."
20:01;20:08;"Well it was nearly summer, we sat on your roof."
20:08;20:16;"Yeah, we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon."
20:16;20:22;"And I shouted stars you never could see."
20:22;20:28;"Baby, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me."
20:28;20:35;"Baby, time meant nothing, anything to me."
20:35;20:42;"Yeah, you could kiss like fire when you made me feel."
20:42;20:48;"Like every word you said was meant to be."
20:48;20:53;"No, it couldn't have been that easy to forget about me."
20:53;21:01;"Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes."
21:01;21:09;"Even the losers keep a little bit of pride."
21:09;21:11;"They get lucky sometimes."
21:11;21:14;"Time Crisis on Beat 1."
21:14;21:17;"But look, I don't mean to rag on Beto too much."
21:17;21:21;"I mean, I can imagine once you start running for president, a new kind of logic takes over."
21:21;21:23;"And that's what you're doing."
21:23;21:24;"You're goal oriented."
21:24;21:26;"And your goal is to become president."
21:26;21:33;"And until your campaign officially ends, you're going to tackle it with zest and whatever it takes."
21:33;21:37;"But one thing I do want to say, just thinking about what's been going on lately."
21:37;21:46;"And, you know, we talked a lot about politics in the last election and then didn't always necessarily feel like people needed their horrifying Trump news from us."
21:46;21:48;"But now that we're back in campaign season."
21:48;21:49;"Jesus Christ."
21:49;21:52;"I do want to say I like Bernie, man."
21:52;21:54;"I think actually we should go do some campaigning for Bernie."
21:54;21:55;"Get back out there."
21:55;21:57;"TC, VW."
21:57;21:58;"We did it last time."
21:58;21:59;"Yeah, man."
21:59;22:00;"Remember in Iowa?"
22:00;22:01;"We did a whole episode."
22:01;22:02;"Of course."
22:02;22:03;"Are you down to get back out there?"
22:03;22:04;"Yeah."
22:04;22:05;"Maybe do a mountain bruise?"
22:05;22:08;"Thank you, Jake and Mountain Bruce."
22:08;22:13;"In the great state of Vermont, I too have partaken in a few mountain bruising my day."
22:13;22:14;"What's Vermont called?"
22:14;22:15;"The Green Mountain State?"
22:15;22:16;"It's the Green Mountain State."
22:16;22:21;"Jake, I hope some of those mountain bruises are Green Mountain Bruce."
22:21;22:27;"I'm referring, of course, to both the Green New Deal and the great state of Vermont."
22:27;22:28;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:28;22:32;"Maybe we got to do a Green Mountain Bruce remix for the Bernie campaign."
22:32;22:33;"Should we have him sing?"
22:33;22:35;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:35;22:36;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:36;22:38;"Green Mountain Bruce."
22:38;22:40;"Sweet as morning dew."
22:40;22:42;"We got to play a little bit of his This Land Is Your Land."
22:42;22:49;"For people who don't remember, during the last campaign, there was an uncovered album from Bernie from the '80s,"
22:49;22:55;"which I believe he did for charity or something, where he was reading, essentially talking over reggae."
22:55;22:57;"And one of them was a reggae version of This Land Is Your Land."
22:57;23:00;"He was like, ""As I went walking these""--what is it?"
23:00;23:01;"Crooked highways?"
23:01;23:02;"It rules."
23:02;23:08;"I saw above me that endless skyway."
23:08;23:14;"I saw below me that golden valley."
23:14;23:17;"This land was made for you and me."
23:17;23:22;"And look, I'm not going to go to the mat and say that there's anything wrong with Elizabeth Warren."
23:22;23:24;"She's saying all the right things."
23:24;23:31;"The most appreciable difference between her and Bernie is that Bernie just has a longer record as a public servant saying the exact same thing."
23:31;23:36;"And this is my personal take, is that there's a lot of reasons to be excited about her as well."
23:36;23:38;"I love the fact that they're on the same team."
23:38;23:46;"It's so clear when you watch the debates that they're two people who respect each other and have more in common with each other than some of the sellouts up there."
23:46;23:51;"But, you know, the reason that I support Bernie is just we live in such a nightmare world."
23:51;23:59;"Things need to be shaken up in such a big way, and the Democrats need to come correct with somebody who's just--maybe is a little bit intractable."
23:59;24:01;"Maybe is an ornery old person."
24:01;24:09;"And if you had to bet on who's going to be a little bit more hardcore about the agenda, Bernie is a pretty good bet compared to Warren."
24:09;24:11;"It doesn't mean they don't believe the same things."
24:11;24:17;"But, again, just Bernie has this long record, and that's why it makes sense to call him a once-in-a-generation politician."
24:17;24:28;"Not because he's saying things that no other politician is saying, just because he's the only politician saying it who has a decades-long career as a politician and has been saying the same things over and over again."
24:28;24:31;"I like the fact that he's still an independent."
24:31;24:33;"I just think, why not?"
24:33;24:42;"Like, so many groups of people in this country have just been f*cked over, over and over again by certainly the Republicans and even the occasional smooth-talking Democrat."
24:42;24:47;"So let's get that ornery person in there just to go lay the--like, why not try it?"
24:47;24:49;"That's the thing, you know?"
24:49;24:55;"Elizabeth Warren has a slightly higher percentage chance of being in the classical Democrat mold than Bernie does."
24:55;24:56;"You know what I mean?"
24:56;24:59;"Yeah, I feel like we've tried every stripe of right-winger."
24:59;25:00;"Let's try a real lefty."
25:00;25:01;"Yeah, let's give that a shot."
25:01;25:03;"Let's try it, you know?"
25:03;25:05;"And the fact that people really like him."
25:05;25:15;"And I also kind of feel a little bit like, look, I recognize we're sitting here, we're coastal elites, sitting here at the Apple Studio in Southern California."
25:15;25:22;"But when you actually look at the math and stuff and you see that difficult jobs that a lot of people in this country have--teachers, fast food workers, truck drivers, nurses--"
25:22;25:29;"and you look at the rates in which people in those professions contribute to Bernie versus anybody else, it's like five or six times."
25:29;25:30;"That's amazing."
25:30;25:33;"And so there's a part of me that kind of feels like it's not just about what I want."
25:33;25:37;"That gives me a feeling that I should be supporting the working people in this world."
25:37;25:41;"I haven't had to worry about health insurance in 14 years."
25:41;25:45;"And sometimes I talk to people who are just like, oh, Bernie, he says the same things over and over again."
25:45;25:52;"But then you realize health insurance and health-related issues are a literal nightmare for so many of our fellow citizens."
25:52;25:54;"Again, let's just try."
25:54;25:56;"Try the guy who's hardcore."
25:56;25:59;"Try the guy who's like, no, f*ck that."
25:59;26:00;"Medicare for all."
26:00;26:01;"Not budging."
26:01;26:02;"Try it."
26:02;26:11;"Because it seems like, actually, despite what some of the media says, it does seem like that's what a lot of people in this country want, is true Medicare for all."
26:11;26:16;"Yeah, it's beyond screwed up that the health insurance industry is so profitable."
26:16;26:24;"One thing that does concern me, if we're just going straight real-deal politics, is this talking point of, if he gets the nomination,"
26:24;26:30;"the big argument against him is he's going to be taking away insurance from 150 million people."
26:30;26:36;"And even though the current status quo sucks, that's going to be such an insane change."
26:36;26:40;"Or, if you're casting it negatively, a disruption."
26:40;26:41;"Right."
26:41;26:48;"That I worry that even though it's the right thing to do, that people aren't going to, I don't know, get the message on that."
26:48;26:50;"Well, look, they're going to be-"
26:50;26:52;"It's just like, that's the only thing that gives me a little pause."
26:52;26:56;"They're going to be coming hard for him, but again, I feel like, why not try?"
26:56;27:00;"If people are suffering to such a high extent, then why not try?"
27:00;27:01;"That's how I feel."
27:01;27:04;"Well, I guess because Trump could get re-elected again."
27:04;27:07;"Oh, you mean if he loses because of that?"
27:07;27:09;"Yeah, I mean, I think that's a possibility."
27:09;27:11;"Well, look, we've just had Trump for four years."
27:11;27:17;"That's the thing that gives me, I mean, I think, like I said, I think Medicare for All is the morally righteous position."
27:17;27:18;"Right."
27:18;27:21;"But it gives me pause that it might be-"
27:21;27:26;"Well, I think the best argument against that is that a centrist Democrat already lost to Trump."
27:26;27:27;"Oh, yeah."
27:27;27:31;"Fairly, and perhaps unfairly, Hillary Clinton, you know, she came damn close to winning."
27:31;27:32;"Yeah."
27:32;27:34;"She basically won, but not quite."
27:34;27:37;"I mean, the insane thing is, is that Trump will lose the popular vote."
27:37;27:38;"We already know that."
27:38;27:39;"Yeah, like no matter what."
27:39;27:40;"That's insane."
27:40;27:43;"I think whatever Democrat runs has a good chance of beating Trump."
27:43;27:44;"Yeah."
27:44;27:47;"And Bernie, according to the polls, Bernie actually has the best chance."
27:47;27:51;"Look, I would totally agree with you or agree with the argument."
27:51;27:52;"That's my concern."
27:52;27:58;"No, no, and I would be very concerned if everybody was kind of like, ""Okay, Bernie, you say the right things."
27:58;27:59;"We're going to pay for college."
27:59;28:01;"We're going to pay for health insurance."""
28:01;28:07;"But when you actually put those ideas out there, when we go do a poll of Bernie versus Trump as opposed to Biden,"
28:07;28:11;"as opposed to anybody else, Trump trounces you, man."
28:11;28:14;"People don't like those ideas, but it doesn't seem to be the case."
28:14;28:16;"It actually seems like people are pretty into it."
28:16;28:18;"Love to pull up some polling numbers."
28:18;28:21;"Everything that I've seen, Bernie always beats Trump the most comfortably."
28:21;28:22;"Yeah."
28:22;28:24;"And also, I got to say, I think it was really sick that AOC and-"
28:24;28:25;"That was sick."
28:25;28:29;"Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib endorsed Bernie."
28:29;28:34;"And I just love seeing the two of them together because they're two people who are united by what they believe in."
28:34;28:39;"There was an interview that they did together where they're sitting in front of both of them, and the journalist said to AOC,"
28:39;28:41;"""Why are you endorsing an old white guy?"""
28:41;28:47;"AOC gets kind of the goofiest, most condescending questions over and over again, and she never breaks."
28:47;28:51;"She's always like, ""The reason I endorse Bernie is because I agree with everything he said because he blah blah."""
28:51;28:56;"And then she goes on to say, ""And because together, we form the coalition that this country needs."""
28:56;29:02;"I think she was also subtly saying, ""Me endorsing Bernie doesn't turn me into an old white man, you moron."""
29:02;29:04;"But she's so polite."
29:04;29:10;"And then you kind of realize, oh yeah, Bernie and her, that's literal diversity."
29:10;29:12;"They share the same set of values."
29:12;29:14;"They share the same set of values, but they're different."
29:14;29:17;"They come from different places, Queens and Brooklyn."
29:17;29:20;"But they obviously have different life experiences."
29:20;29:22;"She's right about he's an old white man."
29:22;29:24;"He's had different privileges and stuff in his life."
29:24;29:28;"But what he recognizes is that they're united by what they believe in, and that's what needs to happen in this country."
29:28;29:32;"And if people are divided by racism or something, well then f*** them."
29:32;29:35;"They're going to miss out on what truly is a necessary good thing."
29:35;29:37;"And he's the one that inspired her to get into politics."
29:37;29:39;"Yeah, it's a great story."
29:39;29:41;"It's like Star Wars or something."
29:41;29:43;"He's the Obi-Wan Kenobi?"
29:43;29:45;"She's Rogue One."
29:45;29:47;"I don't even know what Rogue One is."
29:47;29:49;"I haven't seen any of them in a while. I think he's Yoda and she's Rogue One."
29:49;29:51;"Oh, he's Yoda."
29:51;29:53;"Seinfeld, you a Star Wars nerd?"
29:53;29:55;"I saw the first new one."
29:55;29:57;"But wouldn't he be like Harrison Ford?"
29:57;29:59;"Maybe Bernie's Rogue One and she's a new hope."
29:59;30:00;"Rey."
30:00;30:01;"No, AOC."
30:01;30:02;"Yeah, AOC is Rey."
30:02;30:03;"No, she's a new hope."
30:03;30:05;"I don't think Rogue... Is Rogue One a character?"
30:05;30:07;"I think that's just the name of the film."
30:07;30:10;"I think if Bernie wins, he'll get the Rogue One as the plane, right?"
30:10;30:12;"And in honor to..."
30:12;30:14;"Some dude wins the presidency."
30:14;30:15;"Yeah."
30:15;30:16;"Some like Star Wars nerd."
30:16;30:18;"Changing the name from Air Force One to Rogue One."
30:18;30:25;"It feels like a new sort of high that we're looking up the Wikipedia for Star Wars."
30:25;30:26;"[laughter]"
30:26;30:28;"Oh, wait. It's a ship."
30:28;30:29;"I don't know."
30:29;30:40;"In honor of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I hereby, in the obvious resonance that our mentor-mentee relationship has with the Star Wars universe,"
30:40;30:43;"I am renaming Air Force One, Rogue One."
30:43;30:47;"AOC, you're the Rogue One to my Boba Fett."
30:47;30:52;"America's just like, ""Who did we vote for? What is Boba Fett?"""
30:52;30:54;"The tight thing is that Bernie..."
30:54;30:55;"So, you mean Yoda."
30:55;30:56;"Rogue One is a movie."
30:56;30:58;"Exactly, a Star Wars movie."
30:58;31:03;"The tight thing is that Bernie is so kind of checked out on pop culture."
31:03;31:05;"Oh, yeah. Oh, did you see that..."
31:05;31:06;"Thank you, Twiddle."
31:06;31:08;"Did you see that Ariana..."
31:08;31:10;"Did you see that Ariana Grande thing?"
31:10;31:11;"Oh, yeah."
31:11;31:12;"No, I didn't see this."
31:12;31:13;"That was definitely a Bernie intern."
31:13;31:15;"Oh, yeah. Ariana Grande tweeted..."
31:15;31:17;"Ariana Grande tweeted..."
31:17;31:18;"What is it?"
31:18;31:19;"Is she down with Bernie?"
31:19;31:20;"It kind of seemed like it."
31:20;31:21;"Interesting."
31:21;31:22;"She wasn't not down with him."
31:22;31:24;"Isn't Cardi down with Bernie?"
31:24;31:27;"Oh, Cardi's really down with Bernie. She's done a lot to support the campaign."
31:27;31:29;"She sat down for an interview with him."
31:29;31:31;"Ariana tweeted, ""Baby, how you feeling?"""
31:31;31:36;"And Bernie Sanders quote tweeted it with, ""Ready to fight for Medicare for all."""
31:36;31:38;"And then she followed up when she saw that like, ""Oh, my God."""
31:38;31:39;"That's right."
31:39;31:40;"Tight."
31:40;31:41;"Very elegant."
31:41;31:44;"660,000 likes on that Bernie Sanders retweet."
31:44;31:45;"I retweeted it."
31:45;31:50;"Look, it's a tiny bit corny, but corny times call for corny measures."
31:50;31:52;"So I retweeted that."
31:52;31:54;"I got on Twitter and I did a rare retweet."
31:54;31:58;"And now I'm picturing the Beto O'Rourke email, subject line, ""Ariana Grande."""
31:58;32:03;"Even Bernie Sanders is getting tweets off Ariana Grande."
32:03;32:05;"I need my Beto army."
32:05;32:09;"Subject line, ""Time crisis."""
32:11;32:18;"Even as an ex-indie rocker, I thought I could count on the support of contemporary prominent indie rock musician, Ezra Koenig."
32:18;32:22;"Beto, you could. Just not for president, man."
32:22;32:26;"But I would respect the s--t of Beto if he was like, ""You know what? F--k this s--t. I'm out."""
32:26;32:29;"I'm out, and I'm going to campaign hard for Bernie."
32:29;32:33;"Well, yeah, and there's also like another Texas Senate seat coming up, right?"
32:33;32:34;"Right, yeah, he could run against the other guy."
32:34;32:36;"I wonder if people in Texas would be like, ""Bro, really?"""
32:36;32:40;"I mean, that would be the most brutal if it was kind of like you almost beat Ted Cruz."
32:40;32:46;"And then you squandered the goodwill at home and abroad with this presidential campaign, and then you go back to Texas."
32:46;32:47;"And people are just like..."
32:47;32:48;"Yeah, you lost five points."
32:48;32:49;"Yeah."
32:49;32:50;"You just can't make it back up."
32:50;32:51;"Yeah."
32:51;32:52;"Come on, Beto."
32:52;32:54;"Just go full-time and be like a Bernie guy."
32:54;32:55;"Even..."
32:55;33:01;"Beto army, I need you to flood Ariana's mentions."
33:01;33:02;"Beto army."
33:02;33:04;"Make sure she sees this."
33:04;33:12;"Yeah, I feel like Bernie's getting the full quote tweet back from Ariana Grande, and Beto's getting the, ""I hope she sees this,"" chief."
34:06;34:08;"Anyway, let's go out and do something for Bernie."
34:08;34:09;"And look, TC heads?"
34:09;34:12;"I think in January 2020."
34:12;34:13;"Got to reach out."
34:13;34:17;"I mean, I saw our friend Luis, he came out to the Montreal show."
34:17;34:18;"Oh, right."
34:18;34:20;"A few friends from Burlington came up to that show."
34:20;34:23;"And we're going to be in Burlington in May, I think."
34:23;34:24;"Wow."
34:24;34:26;"So that could be a good opportunity."
34:26;34:32;"Yeah, I mean, by May, you know, that's well on the way towards being a very narrowed race."
34:32;34:34;"Yeah, we got to do something before then."
34:34;34:38;"I got to imagine if you did a poll, a majority of TC heads are probably into Bernie."
34:38;34:40;"Pro Bernie or Bernie curious?"
34:40;34:44;"Yeah, I can't imagine we got too many just like anti-Bernie people."
34:44;34:45;"It's really hard to imagine just like..."
34:45;34:46;"Probably a few."
34:46;34:47;"Yeah, probably a few."
34:47;34:48;"Yeah."
34:48;34:49;"Probably not too many Trump supporters."
34:49;34:52;"I think we've requested if there were Trump supporters to email in."
34:52;34:53;"I haven't heard anything."
34:53;34:54;"What's your deal?"
34:54;34:55;"Deadheads for Trump?"
34:55;34:56;"Although we did talk about that."
34:56;34:57;"Right, that's a thing."
34:57;34:58;"I'm sure."
34:58;35:01;"I can't remember if we talked about it, but there's two things that are kind of making the rounds,"
35:01;35:05;"both related to Trump's relationship to crunchiness."
35:05;35:13;"One is a picture of two of his kids, I think Don Jr. and Ivanka, in one of their childhood bedrooms."
35:13;35:14;"And there's a Grateful Dead poster."
35:14;35:17;"We've used that image to promote shows before."
35:17;35:18;"Richard Pictures has?"
35:18;35:19;"Yeah."
35:19;35:20;"It's like so brutal."
35:20;35:23;"And then the other one is there's a picture of Trump."
35:23;35:24;"This was making the rounds recently."
35:24;35:29;"It's a picture of Trump with Shannon Hoon, singer of Blind Melon,"
35:29;35:34;"because Trump went to a Blind Melon show in the early '90s, I think taking..."
35:34;35:35;"Don Jr. maybe?"
35:35;35:36;"Don Jr. or Ivanka."
35:36;35:40;"So I'm curious, was one of the Trump kids into both Blind Melon..."
35:40;35:44;"Like it's one thing to be like, ""Oh yeah, I was a kid in the early '90s."
35:44;35:50;"The Grateful Dead was huge, and the skull logo looked badass, so I got the poster."""
35:50;35:54;"If one of the kids was into the Dead and Blind Melon, now we're starting to see a pattern."
35:54;35:55;"And going to the show."
35:56;35:58;"So one of those kids was crunchy."
35:58;36:02;"They were growing up with f***ing golden toilets and sink faucets."
36:02;36:03;"Right."
36:03;36:04;"And they still were like..."
36:04;36:08;"Responding to that earthy, early '70s vibes."
36:08;36:13;"So was one of the Trump kids just like a hippie, literally in a gilded cage?"
36:13;36:16;"Well those instincts have been repressed for so many decades at this point."
36:16;36:17;"They're just going to burst out."
36:17;36:18;"We got to make some stickers."
36:18;36:19;"Dose Don Jr."
36:19;36:21;"Dose Don Jr."
36:21;36:23;"Throw on Europe '72."
36:23;36:25;"And just watch the waterworks turn on."
36:25;36:26;"This is who I am, man."
36:26;36:30;"I'm not down with all this f***ing racist right-wing s***, man."
36:30;36:31;"Imagine this."
36:31;36:32;"I could really imagine this."
36:32;36:34;"It's spring '95."
36:34;36:37;"Don Jr.'s like, ""Dad, I got really good grades this year."
36:37;36:39;"Please let me go follow the Grateful Dead."""
36:39;36:40;"It's like, ""What are you talking about?"""
36:40;36:43;"""No, look, I took you to the Blind Melon show."
36:43;36:45;"I let you have the poster, but enough's enough."
36:45;36:48;"You're going to be taking over this company one day."""
36:48;36:50;"He's like, ""But Dad, it's just one summer."
36:50;36:52;"A bunch of my friends are going to go follow the dead."""
36:52;36:55;"And Trump is just like, ""Absolutely not."
36:55;36:57;"They're a bunch of losers."
36:57;37:01;"And you got to start your internship program at Trump Casino in Atlantic City."""
37:01;37:03;"Or whatever, you know, succession s***."
37:03;37:05;"And then he misses out on the whole summer."
37:05;37:06;"And guess what?"
37:06;37:08;"Jerry dies that August."
37:08;37:10;"Never gets to see them again."
37:10;37:13;"He can't really forgive his dad, but then his dad just has that imposing"
37:13;37:15;"Logan Roy energy."
37:15;37:16;"Yeah, maybe he yells at him."
37:16;37:20;"The day he finds out Jerry dies, ""Dad, see what you f***ing did?"
37:20;37:22;"Now I'll never f***ing get to see them."""
37:22;37:24;"And then Trump is just like--holds him."
37:24;37:26;"He's like crying, inconsolable, and Trump just holds him."
37:26;37:28;"He's like, ""It's over, Don."
37:28;37:29;"The Grateful Dead are over."
37:29;37:30;"I'm glad this happened."""
37:30;37:31;"""How could you say that?"""
37:31;37:34;"""Because now it's finally over, my boy."
37:34;37:36;"The Grateful Dead will never tour again."
37:36;37:43;"They would need to find some type of young hotshot guitarist from Connecticut."""
37:43;37:46;"And even then, they couldn't really call it the Grateful Dead."
37:46;37:48;"""Don, my boy."
37:48;37:50;"Don, my boy, it's over."""
37:50;37:52;"I can totally picture that."
37:52;37:54;"Yeah, then he dries his tears."
37:54;37:56;"Next day, he comes back, his hair is slicked back."
37:56;37:57;"""Dad, you're right. Jerry's dead."""
37:57;37:58;"It's 1995."
37:58;38:00;"Come on, it's time to move on."
38:00;38:03;"It's the f***ing '90s, Don."
38:03;38:05;"I think I've mentioned this on the show."
38:05;38:10;"My friend Ryan, who plays in the band, has Paul Manafort's copy of a Byrds album."
38:10;38:12;"Wait, yeah, yeah, this is--"
38:12;38:19;"I think I mentioned this, but yeah, he bought a used vinyl copy of the Byrds Untitled album from 1969 or '70."
38:19;38:21;"And it just said Paul Manafort on the back."
38:21;38:22;"And you know how people used to have their little--"
38:22;38:23;"Stamps sometimes."
38:23;38:26;"Yeah, name tags with their address and phone number on it."
38:26;38:29;"And it's Paul Manafort just on this Byrds album."
38:29;38:31;"He should mail that to the prison he's in."
38:31;38:33;"He's in prison, right?"
38:33;38:34;"I think he is."
38:34;38:35;"Manafort."
38:35;38:36;"Got a package for you."
38:36;38:37;"Manafort got a package for you."
38:37;38:42;"Any chance this is like a John Voight, George Costanza situation where it's just the same name?"
38:42;38:46;"No, he looked up the address on the name tag."
38:46;38:47;"Wow."
38:47;38:48;"And it was actually in Connecticut."
38:48;38:49;"Legit."
38:49;38:50;"And that's where Paul's from."
38:50;38:52;"So it is the same Paul Manafort."
38:52;38:53;"Wow."
38:53;39:00;"Now I'm picturing a Don Jr. handwritten dead cassette bootleg."
39:00;39:04;"Just like, Giant Stadium, 1990."
39:04;39:09;"Please return to Don Trump Jr. Pet House."
39:09;39:10;"Trump Tower."
39:10;39:11;"Yeah."
39:11;39:12;"New York, New York."
39:12;39:13;"Man, maybe it's Ivanka."
39:13;39:15;"I don't know, but one of those Trump kids."
39:15;39:16;"Colin showed me."
39:16;39:18;"Shannon Hoon is definitely Ivanka."
39:18;39:20;"Apparently Blind Melon was one of her favorite bands."
39:20;39:22;"Maybe all the kids were crunchy."
39:22;39:24;"♪ Biu, niu, niu ♪"
39:24;39:26;"♪ All I can say ♪"
39:26;39:28;"And then Shannon died as well."
39:28;39:29;"Probably that year."
39:29;39:30;"Yeah."
39:30;39:33;"Trump taking out all the greats so that his kids don't turn into hippies."
39:33;39:34;"Damn."
39:34;39:35;"Don, dry your eyes."
39:35;39:36;"Come into my office."
39:36;39:38;"I want you to meet somebody."
39:38;39:39;"This is Steve Miller."
39:39;39:43;"And I brought him here to talk to you about the Grateful Dead."
39:43;39:44;"Scared straight."
39:44;39:45;"Hey, listen, Don."
39:45;39:50;"I know it probably sounds pretty cool, what, taking drugs and jamming a 40-minute version"
39:50;39:51;"of ""Playing in the Band."""
39:51;39:52;"Well, guess what, man?"
39:52;39:53;"It's not cool."
39:53;39:54;"It's bullsh*t."
39:54;39:56;"It's indulgent."
39:56;39:58;"It's hedonistic."
39:58;40:00;"It's terrible."

40:02;40:04;"I jam for those guys."
40:04;40:05;"I opened a whole tour."
40:05;40:07;"Don, go work for your dad."

41:48;41:50;"Tiffany, what's your favorite Robert Hunter lyric?"
41:50;41:51;"Maybe Tiffany's into chwetel."
41:51;41:54;"If we reached out to Ivanka and were like,"
41:54;41:57;"""Hey, we're doing this thing on Robert Hunter,"""
41:57;42:00;"love to have you call in with your favorite Robert Hunter lyrics,"

42:05;42:09;"not because we have any particular sway, but she's probably--"
42:09;42:12;"Well, first of all, we would get destroyed for it."
42:12;42:13;"Oh, yeah, I know. Oh, absolutely."
42:13;42:14;"I think-- I could imagine--"
42:14;42:15;"But just as a thought exercise."
42:15;42:19;"Just imagine how much fake smiling she has to do,"
42:19;42:21;"being like, ""Oh, yeah, everything's going great."""
42:21;42:25;"At the end of the day, Ivanka grew up in New York City."
42:25;42:28;"She spent her time in the kind of--"
42:28;42:30;"I'm sure she went to high school with a mixed bag of people,"
42:30;42:33;"but trust me, Ivanka, she used to be out there"
42:33;42:37;"hanging with the liberal Hollywood type,"
42:37;42:39;"musicians, and art people."
42:39;42:41;"So there's no way--"
42:41;42:43;"She's probably not letting it enter her mind,"
42:43;42:46;"but there's no way that she's not at least subconsciously clocking the fact"
42:46;42:49;"that she's not just closed a bunch of doors,"
42:49;42:51;"but burned crazy bridges."
42:51;42:52;"Oh, yeah."
42:52;42:57;"Maybe she would be desperate enough to take a TC call and just like--"
42:57;43:00;"Or like, ""Ivanka, tell us about that Blind Melon show."
43:00;43:02;"We saw the photograph online."""
43:02;43:03;"Oh, thank you."
43:03;43:06;"People just-- they just always want to talk about my father's policies"

43:31;43:34;"We're into the music and Blind Melon rules."
43:34;43:37;"Can we do a fake Time Crisis intro with Ivanka Trump?"
43:37;43:38;"What do you mean?"

43:41;43:43;"Oh, if we did it just to, like, fake people out?"

43:45;43:49;"Time Crisis, back once again."
43:49;43:52;"On this week's episode, we're talking Blind Melon,"

43:57;43:58;"She'll join us in the studio to talk about"
43:58;44:01;"some of her favorite early '90s jam bands."

44:14;44:16;"Terrifying."

47:18;47:19;"No way."
47:19;47:21;"It does sound like a lot."
47:21;47:22;"Well, that's classic Trump, though,"
47:22;47:24;"like, wildly inflating the numbers"
47:24;47:26;"to a very specific number."
47:26;47:28;"I mean, the dead probably played the garden, like,"
47:28;47:32;"maybe, what, 20 times?"
47:32;47:34;"It could be more."
47:34;47:35;"30, 40 times?"
47:35;47:37;"It could be, like, 50, maybe."

48:32;48:34;"Like, maybe he knows Bob's manag--"
48:34;48:37;"Like, there's some weird chain of events"
48:37;48:39;"that led him to being there."
48:39;48:41;"That probably unfolded, like, that day."
48:41;48:42;"Yeah."
48:42;48:43;"Very weird."
48:43;48:45;"I mean, he only probably, you know, lived 30 blocks away."
48:45;48:46;"Yeah."
48:46;48:48;"Somebody who worked with Prince told me a story"
48:48;48:50;"about Prince playing at the Garden,"
48:50;48:53;"and this was probably in a similar era,"
48:53;48:55;"in the Apprentice era,"
48:55;48:58;"in that Trump, you know, talked his way into the show."
48:58;49:00;"He probably had connections with the building, you know?"
49:00;49:01;"Sure."
49:01;49:03;"Like, that's a funny thing with, like,"
49:03;49:05;"when you do shows, 'cause you, you know,"
49:05;49:06;"you sell as many as you can,"
49:06;49:08;"and then there's the extra tickets for, you know,"
49:08;49:10;"the band guest list, the label,"
49:10;49:11;"and then the building."
49:11;49:13;"The building always has their, you know,"
49:13;49:16;"special things that have nothing to do with you."
49:16;49:18;"So probably Trump had a connection with the Garden."
49:18;49:20;"He knows Jimmy Dolan or something."
49:20;49:22;"So Trump wanted to go to the Prince show,"
49:22;49:24;"and apparently Prince heard that he was coming,"
49:24;49:25;"and he couldn't stop him from, like,"
49:25;49:27;"being around and being backstage a little bit."
49:27;49:29;"The guy I talked to who worked on the show"
49:29;49:30;"just really stuck with him,"
49:30;49:33;"and Prince just said, ""Keep that guy away from me."
49:33;49:35;"He's got bad vibes. You keep him far away from me."""
49:35;49:38;"And then, of course, Trump is, like, kind of like,"
49:38;49:39;"""Oh, let me go say hi, blah, blah, blah."""
49:39;49:41;"And he's, like, and he also was just"
49:41;49:42;"apparently going to random people,"
49:42;49:43;"like, ""Walk me to my seat."""
49:43;49:46;"He's like, ""Uh, sir, that's not what I do."
49:46;49:48;"Sir, I'm a keyboard tech."""
49:48;49:50;"He's like, ""Walk me to my seat. Come on."""
49:50;49:51;"Jesus."
49:51;49:53;"But Prince just had this vibe where he was just like,"
49:53;49:55;"""Ooh, keep him away from me."""
49:55;49:56;"""I don't need him in my head space."""
49:56;49:58;"Yeah, bad vibes."

51:15;51:16;"Okay."
51:16;51:17;"And then the weird part, though,"
51:17;51:19;"is that he was also selling signed records,"
51:19;51:21;"but not Morrissey records."
51:21;51:23;"He was selling signed copies of"

51:35;51:37;"but it's also, like, it's such a bizarre move,"

51:38;51:42;"like the extra $1,200 of merch sales"
51:42;51:43;"at the Hollywood Bowl?"
51:43;51:45;"Do you think it was just one copy of each album?"
51:45;51:48;"Like, it was from his personal collection,"
51:48;51:50;"and, like, kind of shopworn,"
51:50;51:51;"or was it just, like--"
51:51;51:52;"Maybe he just had, like, a--"

53:16;53:17;"Yeah."

53:36;53:37;"Just, like, produce."
53:37;53:38;"Wait, this might be illegal."
53:38;53:39;"Morrissey sends somebody to Costco"
53:39;53:41;"to buy, like, the Frito-Lay value packs,"

53:43;53:45;"of Lay's that say ""Not for resale."""
53:45;53:46;"Okay, exactly."
53:46;53:47;"But Morrissey's selling them for $20--"
53:47;53:49;"It's not even that dramatic."
53:49;53:51;"He's just selling them for $4 each."
53:51;53:53;"It's, like, the first lawsuit in history"

54:05;54:06;"[laughs]"
54:06;54:07;"Well, you gotta understand."
54:07;54:08;"I wonder how much they made those,"
54:08;54:10;"like, off those records."
54:10;54:11;"'Cause the Hollywood Bowl's, like,"
54:11;54:12;"a huge venue,"
54:12;54:13;"so, like, a few thousand dollars"
54:13;54:14;"here or there is, like,"
54:14;54:16;"not gonna really move the needle."
54:16;54:17;"Oh, yeah."
54:17;54:18;"You know?"
54:18;54:19;"Despite some of the controversy"
54:19;54:20;"around Morrissey,"
54:20;54:21;"he's been accused of being"
54:21;54:23;"an anti-immigrant racist."
54:23;54:25;"He still does have a very passionate fan base,"
54:25;54:27;"especially in Southern California,"
54:27;54:29;"so you can imagine somebody like Morrissey,"
54:29;54:31;"he's making [bleep] loads of money"
54:31;54:32;"just selling T-shirts that night."
54:32;54:34;"So, yeah, it's a drop in the bucket."
54:34;54:35;"This was just an idea that he had."
54:35;54:36;"Wait, Seinfeld, actually,"
54:36;54:38;"this is a real number crunch."

54:40;54:42;"value packs cost?"
54:42;54:44;"Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,"
54:44;54:46;"now, let's get a number crunch."
54:46;54:50;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
54:50;54:53;"We got the Frito-Lay Classic Mixed Variety"
54:53;54:55;"18 count for $7 from Walmart."
54:55;54:56;"What's in that?"
54:56;54:58;"We got Lay's Cheetos Doritos."
54:58;54:59;"Two kinds of Doritos."
54:59;55:00;"Sun Chips."
55:00;55:03;"I got Lay's Fritos Cheetos Doritos."
55:03;55:04;"Do you know that song, Jake?"
55:04;55:05;"No."
55:05;55:06;"It kind of comes back every Thanksgiving,"
55:06;55:08;"so it's seasonally appropriate."
55:08;55:10;"She's actually a very famous gospel singer, right?"
55:10;55:12;"She's kind of singing a song,"
55:12;55:14;"but it's also taking the, you know,"
55:14;55:15;"she's also preaching a little bit."
55:15;55:17;"You know, obviously, gospel music is religious,"
55:17;55:19;"and I think she's telling kind of a Bible story"
55:19;55:20;"where she's talking about all these animals"
55:20;55:24;"that somebody has, and animals and vegetables, right?"
55:24;55:26;"I got rams, lambs, potatoes, tomatoes."
55:26;55:27;"I think it's like a character in the Bible"
55:27;55:29;"is saying this, and so she's naming all these things,"
55:29;55:31;"and then she goes, ""You name it!"""
55:31;55:33;"And it became like their remixes."
55:33;55:34;"It's just one of those, you know,"
55:34;55:35;"similar to Rise and Shine."
55:35;55:36;"It just became a meme."
55:36;55:38;"Shirley Caesar."
55:38;55:39;"Shirley Caesar."
55:39;55:41;"So in the gospel community, from what I understand,"
55:41;55:42;"she's a very well-known icon,"
55:42;55:44;"but then she became a meme for the younger generation."
55:44;55:46;"I got rams, lambs, potatoes, tomatoes,"
55:46;55:48;"and I just can't believe I just thought of this."
55:48;55:50;"I got Cheetos, Fritos, Doritos."
55:50;55:53;"I got Lay's."
55:53;55:55;"You name it!"
55:55;55:56;"Okay, so anyway, Seinfeld,"
55:56;55:59;"you said you can get 18 of those little ones for $7."
55:59;56:01;"So what's the unit price on that?"
56:01;56:02;"39 cents."
56:02;56:03;"This is actually like, you know,"
56:03;56:04;"when there's, like, kids on the subway"
56:04;56:07;"just selling candy for their baseball team."
56:07;56:08;"That's usually what you do."
56:08;56:10;"Somebody went to Costco or something,"
56:10;56:13;"got a value pack, probably is like 30 cents per Twizzler,"
56:13;56:14;"but if the kid sells it for a dollar,"
56:14;56:16;"that's a decent little profit, you know,"
56:16;56:19;"raising money for your team or your charity or whatever."
56:19;56:22;"So just imagine straight up at a show,"
56:22;56:25;"Morrissey is, like, just talking to his merch guys,"
56:25;56:27;"like, ""I have a brilliant idea."
56:27;56:29;"""You know, I've really been thinking."
56:29;56:32;"""I think we could be making a lot more money"

56:40;56:42;"What's the official name, a Frito-Lay?"
56:42;56:44;"Classic Mixed Variety Pack."

56:47;56:50;"""I crunched the numbers, and really,"

56:53;56:55;"""We can sell them for $1."""

56:58;56:59;"""We sell them for $1."

57:23;57:24;"[laughing]"
57:24;57:26;"A, you have to move a lot of volume,"
57:26;57:29;"and B, you know, the building,"

57:30;57:32;"they're making quite a tidy sum"
57:32;57:34;"selling their own food."
57:34;57:36;"So that could turn into a real brawl."
57:36;57:37;"Yep."
57:37;57:39;"Also, isn't there like animal byproducts"
57:39;57:42;"in the chips that would violate Morrissey's--"
57:42;57:43;"maybe in the Cheetos."
57:43;57:44;"That'd be a--"
57:44;57:45;"'cause you know Morrissey's famously"
57:45;57:47;"a hardcore vegetarian."
57:47;57:48;"Yeah."
57:48;57:49;"Is he vegan?"
57:49;57:50;"Maybe vegan."
57:50;57:51;"Fregan."
57:51;57:52;"It's a freegan."
57:52;57:54;"He identifies as a freegan."
57:54;57:57;"Morrissey caught eating a plate of Buffalo Wild Wings."
57:57;57:59;"They had extra."

58:03;58:05;"Most flavors of Doritos are not vegan."
58:05;58:08;"They contain cheese, milk, buttermilk, whey."
58:08;58:10;"But is Morrissey vegan or just vegetarian?"
58:10;58:11;"He's vegan."
58:11;58:12;"Okay, but--"
58:12;58:13;"That's a no-go on those Cheetos."
58:13;58:14;"Okay, but the Fritos--"
58:14;58:16;"Fritos I think are probably vegan."
58:16;58:18;"That would definitely eat into his profits"
58:18;58:20;"if he bought all the value packs,"
58:20;58:22;"then remembered, oh yeah, the cheese isn't vegan,"
58:22;58:25;"and then they had to throw everything out but the Fritos."
58:25;58:27;"For the record, Fritos are vegan."

01:03:30;01:03:33;"kind of an example of his peak mania,"

01:04:05;01:04:06;"- No, and then at the very end,"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"they bring out this cardboard cutout of Jerry,"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"and they're like, ""And hey, Jerry!"""
01:04:09;01:04:11;"And apparently, just Jerry didn't want to go."

01:04:15;01:04:16;"- So Elton John was like,"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"yeah, he finally sits down,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"and then this cardboard cutout of Jerry"
01:04:19;01:04:22;"is like the one dude who actually felt the same way."

01:04:23;01:04:24;"- Yeah, so anyway, that's the one reference"
01:04:24;01:04:26;"to the Grateful Dead in Elton John's book."
01:04:26;01:04:29;"And also another reason why I think Elton John"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"would be right at home on TC"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"is because later in the book,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"he became a father very late in life."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"So he has two kids, and so he's making a decision,"
01:04:38;01:04:40;"and he and his husband are talking about it."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"And he said, ""My husband,"""
01:04:42;01:04:43;"who had become his manager at the time,"
01:04:43;01:04:47;"""basically gave him a 10 or 15 year plan."""
01:04:47;01:04:50;"And he said, ""Now listen, you're still hot,"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"""you can go tour around the world,"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"""you can make loads of money,"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"""I'm gonna be keeping an eye on all this stuff,"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"""but what I need you to tell me is,"""
01:04:57;01:04:59;"obviously it's his husband and his manager,"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"so he's like, ""So let's compare"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"""your touring schedule to family life."""
01:05:02;01:05:03;"So he said, ""You know, 'cause I just want you"
01:05:03;01:05:06;"""to keep in mind, if you go tour hard this year,"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"""that's the year that, you know,"
01:05:07;01:05:10;"""one of our sons is gonna be in eighth grade,"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"""and you would miss this,"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"""and you might miss his first, you know,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"""day of school as a freshman,"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"""and his high school graduation."""
01:05:16;01:05:18;"He basically painted him this picture of like,"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"this is what'll be going on with our kids"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"for the next 15 years."
01:05:21;01:05:24;"And he said to Elton, ""What do you wanna be here for?"""
01:05:24;01:05:26;"You know, 'cause Elton John might've been like,"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"""Well, okay, if I miss a few summers with the boys,"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"""that's okay, or if I miss like"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"""part of their school year, but we make up,"""
01:05:30;01:05:32;"you know, you could imagine what kind of"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"conversation somebody might have."
01:05:34;01:05:35;"And then Elton, it's a sweet moment,"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"says, ""You know what, I wanna be here for all of it."""
01:05:37;01:05:38;"And that's when he's kinda like,"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"""I'm not gonna tour as hard as I used to,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"""and let's figure out how to only do private,"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"""I don't know, whatever he came up with."""
01:05:44;01:05:46;"And then the way he writes about it is saying like,"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"you know, ""I realized I wanted to be there for all of it."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"""I don't wanna miss it, Aerosmith style."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"""I don't wanna miss a thing."""
01:05:52;01:05:54;"And then he says, ""The idea that like,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"""something special could be happening in my boy's life,"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"""and I might be at Madison Square Garden"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"""or the Staples Center, or Taco Bell Arena in Boise."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"""It crushed me."""
01:06:03;01:06:06;"Yeah, it's like, he just said it 'cause it was funny."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"- That rules."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- He must have played there or seen it somewhere"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"and just been like, ""Taco Bell Arena in Boise,"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"""that's a funny name."""
01:06:11;01:06:13;"- So he moved the family to Vegas."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"- Yeah, he kind of, I guess he figured it out."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"- Yeah, boys, you're gonna grow up in Vegas."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"- Dad, just go play Taco Bell Arena."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Actually, Vegas seems like an interesting place to grow up."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"And I think the real Vegans,"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"are people called Las Vegans?"
01:06:26;01:06:27;"- Vegans."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"- Las Vegans."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"- I think, no, I think they're Las Vegans."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"- On the rare occasion that you meet a true native Las Vegan,"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"they're very interesting people."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"'Cause it's like they get to watch this crazy cross section"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"of the rest of the country and world"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"come in through their city."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"I've always been curious"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"because I've never actually gotten to see it"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"because every time I've been in Vegas,"
01:06:45;01:06:48;"you stay on the strip or we were just at Life is Beautiful."
01:06:48;01:06:52;"It can be really hard to meet the permanent residents."
01:06:52;01:06:53;"- The locals."
01:06:53;01:06:56;"- Yeah, but it must be a fascinating town to grow up in."
01:06:56;01:06:59;"- In the shadow of all that vice."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"- Yeah, I wonder what does a suburb of Vegas look like?"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- Probably like a suburb of Phoenix or--"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- Well, 'cause the desert starts so quick, right?"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Yeah."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"- 'Cause in movies that take place in Vegas,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"like Casino or something,"
01:07:11;01:07:14;"I feel like every good Vegas movie always has a scene"
01:07:14;01:07:17;"where they're just out in just the rawest, empty desert."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"They got in the car for 10 minutes"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"and then they're just on Mars."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"- The time I've driven through"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"and played a few shows there about 20 years ago."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Yeah, Wolf Kernel?"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"- Yeah, Wolf Kernel shows."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- So it's a real indie DIY Vegas show?"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"- Yeah, they were in an all-ages show in a coffee shop,"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"in a strip mall in residential Vegas."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- Oh, so you have seen true residential Vegas."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"- Yeah, and I remember it just being pretty stark."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- I have a vague memory being on tour"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"and stopping for lunch in Cheyenne, Wyoming"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"and seeing that there were these houses"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"that looked like they were from the 1880s, 1890s."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- Yeah, like Victorians."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- Yeah, Victorian frontier."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"So I wonder if there must be towns in Nevada like that."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"You know who would be a good person to get on the program?"
01:07:58;01:07:59;"- Vegas-centric?"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"- Yeah."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"- Brandon Flowers."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"- Brandon Flowers, yeah."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"- Jimmy Kimmel."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"- Why Jimmy Kimmel?"
01:08:04;01:08:05;"- He's from Vegas."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- Jimmy Kimmel's from Vegas."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"- I don't know why I know that, but he is, yeah."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"- Shout out to Jimmy Kimmel."
01:08:09;01:08:11;"He listened to the Huey Lewis episode"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"and he tweeted about it."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"- That's right, that's awesome."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"- I like that he tweeted,"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"""Everybody check out this interview with Huey Lewis."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"""You should listen to it, it's cool."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"""It starts at the 41-minute mark."""
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And then we had a couple of TC heads in the comments"
01:08:21;01:08:24;"being like, ""Don't sleep on that first 41, man."""
01:08:24;01:08:25;"(laughing)"
01:08:25;01:08:28;"- Don't sleep on that Mountain Brews breakdown,"
01:08:28;01:08:29;"that SLC soundboard."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"I wonder if Jimmy Kimmel listened to that."
01:08:32;01:08:35;"- No, he scrubbed forward to that Huey Lewis."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- He scrobbled past."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"- Yeah, he scrobbled past."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I wonder if the Elton that was so tormented"
01:08:40;01:08:44;"about the decision to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"ceremony in 1994,"
01:08:46;01:08:50;"what that Elton felt like about the Vegas residency."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"- Well, he said one interesting thing in the book about it,"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"which is one thing about him is he's a huge, huge music"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"collector and nerd."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"So he talks about how he was pretty checked out"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"from streaming because he just,"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"at one point he owned, he bought this off a DJ,"
01:09:04;01:09:07;"he owned every single release in the UK"
01:09:07;01:09:10;"from like 1955 to 1975."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"He literally owns maybe millions,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"at least hundreds of thousands of records."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"- Jesus Christ."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"- He's a huge stats geek too."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"He talks about when he was growing up,"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"he was obsessed with soccer and he was also just obsessed"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"with the charts."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"And I watched this."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"- Wow, he would be good for TC."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"- Yeah, seriously."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"I bet we'd be like,"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"we're comparing the top five since September, 1972."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"And he'd just be like, BG's,"
01:09:31;01:09:35;"just Rain Man style, just list them off."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"And he says how you would always keep a little notebook"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"where he would just like write down the charts."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"And then he continued to do that into adulthood."
01:09:43;01:09:46;"He was like obsessively watching his own singles"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"and things like that."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"So when he talks about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"
01:09:49;01:09:52;"I think his feeling was because he was such a hardcore"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"rock and roll guy, he was like the beginning"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"which was about honoring the original rockers,"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"the 1950s originators."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- Yeah."
01:10:01;01:10:02;"- He loved that because he felt like"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"there are all these people, you know,"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"I don't know who he's talking about,"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Little Richard and probably people whose names"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"aren't even as big as Little Richard."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"He was talking about, you know,"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"these original American artists,"
01:10:12;01:10:15;"mostly black American artists who, you know,"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"influenced the British people and all this."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"So he loved that."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"He just said he found it a little hoity-toity"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"to be honoring, you know, who came next."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"He just didn't see the point."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"And when he talks about his Vegas show,"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"I guess the first time he did a Vegas show,"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"it was like very controversial"
01:10:29;01:10:32;"'cause he hired David LaChapelle, the photographer,"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"and they made it like very provocative."
01:10:34;01:10:36;"He was a little bit too early to do"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"a very provocative Vegas show."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"So I think he saw it as an art form"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"that you could do something interesting in."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"And also now everybody does it."
01:10:43;01:10:46;"Blink-182 did a Vegas residency recently."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"- It's 25 years after you released your first album"
01:10:48;01:10:49;"that you're eligible."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"- For the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"- Yeah. - Oh, (beep)"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Wait, will we--"
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- So 14 years from now."
01:10:54;01:10:55;"- 2033."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"- ♪ 2033 ♪"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"♪ 2033, will you think about me ♪"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"♪ Playing on the Vegas strip ♪"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"Dude, Vampire Weekend on the strip"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction."
01:11:06;01:11:07;"- Yeah, the year we get induction"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- Do a Vegas residency."
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- Yeah."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"- Richard Vickers opening."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"(laughing)"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"- That'd be tight."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"All right, should we get into the top five?"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"- Let's do the top five."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"- It's time for the top five."
01:11:21;01:11:24;"Five on iTunes."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"- All right, so this week on the top five,"
01:11:26;01:11:29;"which again, we canned last time."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"How many TCs don't have a top five?"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"That's one for the stat sets."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"Maybe Elton knows."
01:11:34;01:11:35;"This week on the top five,"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"we're comparing the top five songs on iTunes"
01:11:37;01:11:41;"right now to the top five songs this week"
01:11:41;01:11:43;"in 1972 on the Billboard charts."
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Why 1972?"
01:11:44;01:11:47;"'Cause Europe '72, simple as that."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Also, it's the year that Beto was born."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"- Our boy."
01:11:50;01:11:51;"- Beto was born."
01:11:51;01:11:52;"- I haven't done a '70s one in a minute."
01:11:52;01:11:55;"- Yeah, we're kinda getting back to the tasteful palate."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"The number five song."
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Oh, this is curious to me."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"I know as a stats geek myself that this song"
01:12:01;01:12:02;"is from the '60s."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Moody Blues, Nights in White Satin."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"So I gotta read up on this."
01:12:07;01:12:10;"While originally released in 1967 to marginal success,"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"only hit 103 in the US, Nights in White Satin"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"was re-released in the US in 1972"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100."
01:12:18;01:12:19;"- Weird."
01:12:19;01:12:20;"- Maybe it was too ahead of its time."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"In the '70s, prog rock was finally hitting"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"and the Moody Blues kinda got their respect."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"(orchestral music)"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Super orchestral, epic."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"- Yeah, it's funny."
01:12:29;01:12:33;"They're probably trying to riff on pet sounds or something,"
01:12:33;01:12:34;"but it ends up--"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Being more '70s prog."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"- Yeah, totally."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"(orchestral music)"
01:12:39;01:12:45;"- Great song."

01:22:04;01:22:05;"Maybe not, I don't think on TC."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"But I just remember at some point,"
01:22:07;01:22:10;"I was probably like 25 and I had a dirty martini"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"for the first time."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"I think sometimes if you're not sure"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"if you're a drinker or not,"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"you're always just looking for what's my drink."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- Sure."
01:22:17;01:22:19;"- And I think I had a dirty martini and I was like,"
01:22:19;01:22:22;"wow, this actually tastes good to me."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"I love that it's like salty."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"I never really liked sugary fruity drinks."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"I was like, I love that it's salty"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"and it comes, you know, an ice cold, dirty martini."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"Man, I could slam this."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"This makes me happy to drink."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"- Yikes."
01:22:34;01:22:36;"- I was sitting at, I was at some hotel."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"I remember this was the first time I ever met Janelle Monae."
01:22:38;01:22:40;"Thankfully not later when at Corner Bistro."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"We were at some hotel and I was like,"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"all these people are sitting around."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"I'm like, you know what?"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"Let me loosen up."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"Meeting people for the first time,"
01:22:47;01:22:49;"young man in downtown Manhattan."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"So I remember I like drank one,"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"then I drank another one."
01:22:51;01:22:52;"I was like--"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- Life's great."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"I found my drink."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And then this is where I know I really made a mistake."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"I feel like my final count might've been like five,"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"but they were in such quick succession."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"- 'Cause that's just pure vodka, right?"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"I think so."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"With like olive juice and (beep) in there."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"- I think I was doing gin ones, but yeah."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"- Yikes."
01:23:07;01:23:09;"- Yeah, it's vermouth, gin."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"- Okay."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"- And so I remember maybe after two,"
01:23:11;01:23:14;"and I'm just like, I feel (beep) great."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"Just hanging out."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"And I was like, you know what?"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"I'm a drinker, man."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"And so this is where I knew I really messed up."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"This is classic hubristic-ness."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"This is such hubris."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"And I remember that the waiter came back"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"and I was like, let me get two."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"(laughing)"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"I was like, 'cause I'm throwing these back so fast."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I was so stupid."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"- Wow, this is so out of character for you."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"- I know, but you know,"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"sometimes you gotta go down some dark paths"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"to find out who you really are."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"And then I feel like maybe I had four in quick succession"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"at whatever hotel we're at,"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"and then some other group peeled off"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"to go to Corner Bistro."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"I'm like, that's good."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"The place is famous for its burgers."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"So I was like, yeah, definitely use a burger."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"Just slammed four, but I'm still feeling good."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Then I feel like I sat down there,"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"probably ordered another drink."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"- Jesus."
01:23:53;01:23:54;"- And then I just remember taking a bite"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"and just being like, yeah,"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"and just running to the bathroom, just puking."
01:23:58;01:23:59;"- So it was that night."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"It was like an hour later."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"- Yeah, I feel like it was such a quick turnaround."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"- Wow."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"- And then I was just like,"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"I'll never do this again."
01:24:06;01:24:07;"Not a drinker."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"- You're like, Janelle, I gotta go."
01:24:08;01:24:11;"- Yeah, no, luckily she didn't come to Corner Bistro."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"- Can you just come back out to hang out with Janelle?"
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Your eyes are all red."
01:24:14;01:24:15;"- Yeah."
01:24:15;01:24:16;"- Face is all puffy."
01:24:16;01:24:17;"- I feel like she wasn't even drinking."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"I was just trying to be a cool guy,"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"just slamming dirty martinis."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"I wasn't just trying to be cool."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"I legitimately was enjoying drinking them"
01:24:24;01:24:27;"and being like, oh, this is what it's like to be a drinker."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"So that's unusual that this late,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I mean, surely you know."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"- It happens every few years."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"- Did you do beer before liquor?"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"- Yeah, it was like, we were having a big party at our house."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"- No, but liquor before beer, you're in the clear."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Beer before liquor, you didn't know that?"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"- I don't think that's true."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"At a certain quantity, it doesn't matter, dude."
01:24:42;01:24:46;"Just a lot of beer and tequila over like a six hour period."
01:24:46;01:24:47;"Went to bed, felt great."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Woke up at like eight, felt pretty good."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"- Yeah."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"- Pop some Advil, went back to sleep,"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"woke up at 10.30 and I was like, ooh."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Cleaned the place up, went to breakfast."
01:24:56;01:24:57;"- When did you have coffee?"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"- Didn't do coffee."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"- Until breakfast?"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"- I had like a Coke on ice."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"- Oh yeah, that's classic hungover."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"- Yeah, carbonation."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"This is such like."
01:25:05;01:25:06;"- This is very unusual."
01:25:06;01:25:07;"- Like frat?"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Yeah."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Like frat pot?"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"- Oh bro, bro I'm with you."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"- Four shots of Jager."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- No, but I know that actually reminds me"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"so much of being in college."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"It's before I was like a hardcore Java hound."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"- Uh-huh."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- I knew that I liked coffee,"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"but it was still kind of hit or miss."
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Like occasionally I'd walk past like a street cart"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"on my way to like my seminar and just be like,"
01:25:25;01:25:28;"oh, let me get like a regular coffee."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"And then in New York they just put like milk and sugar."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- Light and sweet honey."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"- And I was just kind of like, oh yeah, light and sweet."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"(laughing)"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"So I knew I liked coffee, but it wasn't like, you know,"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"now just like every morning my coffee."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"- Ritual."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"- The coffee before the coffee vibe."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"- Yeah."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"- But I totally remember that feeling"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"of waking up like super hungover."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Today my body would just be like, go get a coffee."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"But then just like rolling up to like the Seinfeld diner."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"- Yeah."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"- That was like one of our go-tos and just be like,"
01:25:53;01:25:56;"oh, let me get a grilled cheese with a pickle,"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"a side of mashed potatoes and grape,"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"like some weird ass thing."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Oh, and a Coke on ice."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"That was such like a young hungover thing."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"And then go back and be like, all right, I feel okay now."
01:26:05;01:26:07;"Go back to my room, sleep for four hours."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"- I hadn't pulled that move in years,"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"but I was thankful that there was some soda on the house."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"- So then you get down to the diner."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"- One bite of French toast and I was like,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"luckily no one was in the bathroom."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"- This should be the sequel to Mountain Bruce."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Mountain Bruce is like, you went for a hike?"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"- No, after that I went and worked on Mountain Bruce."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- Oh really? - Yeah."
01:26:26;01:26:28;"- You just wrote like, it was like a minor key."

01:58:32;01:58:34;"are clearly already gentrified."
01:58:34;01:58:37;"So I can just picture the person who owns the ice cream store"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"being like, ""Well, my artisanal ice cream store"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"""that I opened in a formerly poor neighborhood,"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"""uh, yeah, that's not gentrification."
01:58:43;01:58:44;"""Not like these guys."""
01:58:44;01:58:45;"(laughing)"
01:58:45;01:58:48;"I'm just saying, I think there's probably a lot of hypocrisy."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"That doesn't mean they're--"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"It's wrong, it's all wrong, but--"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"- Yeah, I mean, bottom line, that video rules."
01:58:53;01:58:54;"(laughing)"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"- Like, yeah, you guys are all gentrifiers."
01:58:56;01:58:59;"At least they can rap in a town called Denver."
01:58:59;01:59:00;"(laughing)"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"- It's funny, I never knew that."
01:59:02;01:59:05;"That's such a hilarious, like, extra layer of the story"
01:59:05;01:59:06;"to be like, you see this lame video,"
01:59:06;01:59:08;"and you're just like, ""Oh, come on,"""
01:59:08;01:59:10;"and then you're like, ""Wow, these people got fired."""
01:59:10;01:59:11;"- That sucks."
01:59:11;01:59:14;"- Yeah, I'm curious, the bigger company that can these people,"
01:59:14;01:59:17;"please give me any evidence that that larger company"
01:59:17;01:59:20;"somehow has, like, kind vibe, anti-gentrification policies."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"- Right, change their policies."
01:59:21;01:59:25;"- 'Cause I've never heard of a major real estate agent company"
01:59:25;01:59:26;"in, like, a big city like that"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"who doesn't love gentrification,"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"love the chance to sell more luxury condos."
01:59:30;01:59:33;"Okay, next episode, we're gonna be really digging into the dirt"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"on the Denver real estate market."
01:59:35;01:59:38;"But no, but I have definitely heard that Colorado's got"
01:59:38;01:59:40;"some major issues because even though they legalized weed,"
01:59:40;01:59:45;"the rate of, like, black people still getting arrested for weed"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"is, like, still super out of whack."
01:59:47;01:59:48;"- Wait, but it's legal?"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"- Oh, weed's totally legal in Colorado."
01:59:50;01:59:51;"- But people are arrested."
01:59:51;01:59:52;"- You know, there's rules."
01:59:52;01:59:54;"- Uh-huh, over a certain amount or something."
01:59:54;01:59:55;"- Yeah."
01:59:55;01:59:56;"(inhaling)"
01:59:56;01:59:57;"- Woo!"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"- That's another thing about Bernie."
01:59:59;02:00:02;"No waffling, just straight up, ""Marijuana should be legal."""
02:00:02;02:00:03;"- Yeah."
02:00:03;02:00:04;"- He's not a stoner."
02:00:04;02:00:06;"- Is he the only one on the Dem side that's--"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"- No, I feel like other people have said it,"
02:00:08;02:00:10;"but he's, like, he just has, like, a forcefulness about it."
02:00:10;02:00:11;"- Yeah."
02:00:11;02:00:12;"- Where he's just like, ""Marijuana should be legal."
02:00:12;02:00:14;"""There should be, you know, amnesty for blah, blah, blah."""
02:00:14;02:00:19;"God, the idea that there's anybody sitting in prison for weed--"
02:00:19;02:00:20;"- Is insane."
02:00:20;02:00:22;"- Is such a travesty."
02:00:22;02:00:24;"And obviously, the vast majority of those people"
02:00:24;02:00:26;"are black and Hispanic."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"It's so f---ed up."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"It makes my blood boil."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"God, so many good reasons to vote for Bernie."
02:00:30;02:00:32;"Shout-out to Bernie."
02:00:32;02:00:34;"Denver, get your act together."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"This has been Time Crisis."
02:00:35;02:00:38;"See you in two weeks for Grateful Giving."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"Remember, we rebranded Thanksgiving."
02:00:40;02:00:41;"Do some research."
02:00:41;02:00:44;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:00:44;02:00:47;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"One."
