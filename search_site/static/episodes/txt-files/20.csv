00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles."
00:06;00:10;"I'm rejoined by my LA co-host Jake Longstreth."
00:10;00:12;"He's going to be talking to us about the history of the NRA."
00:12;00:18;"We'll also be jumping on the phone with Grizzly Bears' Ed Droste to talk about Life After"
00:18;00:19;"Bernie."
00:19;00:28;"This, plus Smash Mouth, and the hits of 1968 and today."
00:28;00:35;"Welcome back to Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:59;01:09;"[applause]"
01:23;01:43;"[applause]"
03:03;03:13;"[applause]"
03:13;03:14;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
03:14;03:17;"That was the Tom Robinson band with Glad to Be Gay."
03:17;03:19;"You ever heard of Tom Robinson, Jake?"
03:19;03:20;"No."
03:20;03:25;"My dad had that record when I was growing up and Tom Robinson was kind of associated"
03:25;03:31;"with like pub rock or like punk era British music, but he was way ahead of the curve as"
03:31;03:36;"far as being an openly gay singer in a rock band in the UK and that was like a fairly"
03:36;03:41;"explicit political song that he wrote, definitely with a satirical edge, but called Glad to"
03:41;03:45;"Be Gay, which in the late 70s, I don't know how mainstream he was."
03:45;03:50;"He was definitely like a respected songwriter in the UK, but yeah, to write a song called"
03:50;03:51;"Glad to Be Gay."
03:51;03:55;"Obviously, there was like similar sentiments happening in other types of music, but especially"
03:55;03:58;"in music related to like punk rock."
03:58;04:04;"I was thinking about that song in the aftermath of the Orlando tragedy, thinking about this"
04:04;04:08;"songwriter who I always admired, Tom Robinson, and the fact that he was really ahead of his"
04:08;04:11;"time in the late 70s to sing if you're glad to be gay."
04:11;04:15;"It's crazy to recognize that that sentiment, a simple sentiment, you should be glad to"
04:15;04:22;"be yourself and specifically glad to be gay is still controversial or scary in many places,"
04:22;04:23;"including in this country."
04:23;04:29;"So on this episode, I was thinking maybe we would try to keep it real mellow, but I think"
04:29;04:31;"we have to keep it a little bit political."
04:31;04:35;"So later in the show, Jake, you've been doing such great reporting about Doritos and Fritos."
04:35;04:36;"PepsiCo."
04:36;04:37;"And PepsiCo."
04:37;04:41;"We thought that maybe you were ready to step it up and talk about the NRA."
04:41;04:42;"History of."
04:42;04:43;"Just the history of the NRA."
04:43;04:47;"It's not that different than the history of Doritos, so we'll get into that later."
04:47;04:48;"Well."
04:48;04:50;"Well, we'll find out."
04:50;04:51;"No spoilers."
04:51;04:55;"But in terms of other things going on, it's the end of the road for Bernie."
04:55;05:00;"I thought we might get my old friend, Ed Droste of the band Grizzly Bear on the phone."
05:00;05:04;"Ed's been out there campaigning for Bernie too, and I know he felt very strongly about it."
05:04;05:08;"Towards the end, you know, with all these horrible things happening in the world, I've been a"
05:08;05:09;"little bit checked out."
05:09;05:13;"It's kind of like, look, if Bernie comes through at the end, it'd be amazing."
05:13;05:17;"But at the same time, stopping Donald Trump is important and I'm not going to get on some"
05:17;05:18;"crazy like."
05:18;05:21;"Well, you know, Trump and Hillary are the same."
05:21;05:22;"That's insane to me."
05:22;05:24;"But I saw Ed was kind of like very passionate to the end."
05:24;05:28;"I had to like stop looking at social media a little bit and Ed was kind of getting some"
05:28;05:31;"flame wars on Instagram and I admire the passion."
05:31;05:34;"I just wanted to check in with him and see how he's doing."
05:34;05:37;"See if he's on board with Hillary or just all of the above."
05:37;05:38;"Yeah."
05:38;05:39;"All of the above."
05:39;05:40;"So let's give Ed a call."
05:40;05:44;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
05:44;05:48;"Hello."
05:48;05:50;"Hey, what's up, Ed?"
05:50;05:54;"You're on Time Crisis here with me and Jake Longstreth."
05:54;05:55;"Hey, guys."
05:55;05:56;"So you're in upstate New York?"
05:56;06:03;"Yes, I'm in Kingston, New York right now at a Comfort Inn by myself because I misplanned"
06:03;06:07;"my recording trip out east with the band and I have a night to kill."
06:07;06:11;"So I'm just chilling in a Comfort Inn."
06:11;06:13;"And you were working in the studio today?"
06:13;06:17;"Well, today was the pack up, but we've been there for the past two weeks and way more"
06:17;06:21;"progress than we ever thought would have happened happened, which is amazing because it's been"
06:21;06:23;"a long time for us."
06:23;06:29;"And we're super excited about having jumped into the new album process, which has been"
06:29;06:30;"a long time coming."
06:30;06:31;"But yeah, it was great."
06:31;06:34;"And we're going to come back up here again pretty soon and wrap things up."
06:34;06:35;"Great."
06:35;06:39;"So we were just talking a little bit about how it's the end of the road for Bernie."
06:39;06:40;"I hate to hear that."
06:41;06:42;"I know."
06:42;06:43;"It's realistic."
06:44;06:45;"I don't like to hear it."
06:45;06:51;"Well, there's so many dark things happening in the world now, but specifically, we wanted"
06:51;06:55;"to talk with you about Bernie because we both were out there supporting him."
06:55;07:00;"I was a little checked out towards the end, maybe because I was getting exhausted seeing"
07:00;07:04;"all the opinions one way or another, but you were kind of in it to the bitter end."
07:04;07:08;"Well, I joined in a little bit later than you because I was not able."
07:08;07:13;"I think I probably learned more about him slightly later than you did, but also I wasn't"
07:13;07:18;"able to get the band to perform and then I wasn't able to devote time being a surrogate"
07:18;07:20;"until April."
07:20;07:26;"So that's when I started actively being involved other than posting an Instagram post or something"
07:26;07:27;"like that."
07:27;07:31;"So at the end, it seemed like you were getting some flame wars on Instagram with Hillary"
07:31;07:32;"supporters."
07:32;07:33;"What was going on?"
07:33;07:37;"There was no one person that I got into a war with at all."
07:37;07:42;"I just was really annoyed with the way that things played out at the end."
07:42;07:47;"And I feel like, to be honest, this entire election has been extremely enlightening to"
07:47;07:49;"me about the process."
07:49;07:55;"And I have to say, I do feel sort of disillusioned by it all, but I definitely feel more energized"
07:55;08:04;"than usual to hopefully fix the insane amount of problems that I both witnessed and read"
08:04;08:05;"about."
08:05;08:06;"Right."
08:06;08:10;"And I feel like when I was complaining about the New York primary voter registration, it"
08:10;08:15;"was amazing to me that so many people, it kind of seemed like they agreed, but they"
08:15;08:16;"were still kind of like, but who cares?"
08:16;08:17;"It's a private institution."
08:17;08:20;"Like, oh, you care about this right now?"
08:20;08:22;"And it's like, yeah, because it's true."
08:22;08:25;"I don't think about it that much before the election."
08:25;08:30;"But as a citizen, it's like, these are things that are bigger than, way bigger than Bernie."
08:30;08:33;"So if we truly care about changing the process, it has to happen."
08:33;08:38;"And in the meantime, of course, naturally people are going to be looking to the general"
08:38;08:39;"election."
08:39;08:41;"And this one's shaping up to be especially brutal."
08:41;08:42;"So how do you feel about that, Ed?"
08:42;08:45;"Like, I know that you're very critical of Hillary."
08:45;08:48;"What you've said about her, I think, has always been certainly within reason."
08:48;08:51;"You going to be able to pull the trigger for HRC?"
08:51;08:56;"It's a tough trigger to pull, but yeah, I don't advocate not voting."
08:56;08:59;"I think it's important, even if you're not excited about the candidates."
08:59;09:02;"And to be honest, to backtrack a little bit."
09:02;09:09;"I would just like to give credit to the Sanders campaign for energizing me in a way that I've"
09:09;09:16;"never been energized to educate myself on insane intricacies and details of politics,"
09:16;09:18;"first of all, within this country."
09:18;09:24;"And also to realize how important down-ballot elections are and midterms and all those things."
09:24;09:28;"Because I was sort of a run-of-the-mill, just voting for the Dem."
09:28;09:30;"And like, we'll see how the primaries turn out."
09:30;09:36;"Like, not really that stressed about it until there was such a stark difference between Hillary and Bernie."
09:36;09:39;"And I guess it was just suddenly-- it's sort of like someone being like,"
09:39;09:43;"""You're going to be a platinum number one artist."""
09:43;09:46;"And you're like, ""What? I never thought that was possible."
09:46;09:48;"I make really melancholic, sleepy music."""
09:48;09:51;"And they're like, ""No, it is possible."""
09:51;09:53;"I mean, it's a horrible analogy, but it's sort of like--"
09:53;09:54;"You mean, you're sort of--"
09:54;09:56;"The analogy is that Bernie's like--"
09:56;09:59;"He came out of nowhere and suddenly was like this sort of like candy that was like,"
09:59;10:02;"""Wait, I didn't think we were allowed to have that."""
10:02;10:05;"It didn't even seem within the realm of possibility."
10:05;10:08;"Right, like how could a socialist truly become president?"
10:08;10:10;"A democratic socialist, Ezra. Come on."
10:10;10:11;"Right, right, right."
10:11;10:13;"Let's remember what we're talking about here."
10:13;10:16;"And that's another thing, is that he did incredibly well."
10:16;10:17;"It's amazing."
10:17;10:21;"People really didn't believe that that dude could really go that far."
10:21;10:27;"I mean, he inspired me in a way that was like next level, for sure."
10:27;10:28;"Like, it was emotional."
10:28;10:30;"The question is looking forward, though,"
10:30;10:33;"because the problem with politics--you see it on all sides."
10:33;10:36;"People really identify with politicians on a human level,"
10:36;10:38;"which can be problematic, but it's not weird."
10:38;10:39;"No."
10:39;10:41;"Some people really identify with Hillary."
10:41;10:42;"She's meaningful to them."
10:42;10:45;"They recognize themselves in her or people in their lives in her."
10:45;10:47;"And the same thing is true with Bernie."
10:47;10:50;"So the question is, ultimately, though, these are just two human beings."
10:50;10:53;"So if what we liked about Bernie were his policies,"
10:53;10:57;"then presumably the next step is to support the candidate"
10:57;11:00;"who would be the closest to Bernie's policies,"
11:00;11:03;"which between Trump and Hillary is obviously Hillary."
11:03;11:08;"Yes, and first let me say that I guess the way to look forward post-Bernie"
11:08;11:13;"is that I really hope that he's able to continue to use his leverage"
11:13;11:18;"of new voters and excitement and the movement that he's created"
11:18;11:22;"and the people around him have created to push Hillary left,"
11:22;11:24;"and I hope that she, in this age of the Internet,"
11:24;11:28;"is held accountable to a lot of the things that she suddenly swayed left to."
11:28;11:30;"So in that sense, cool."
11:30;11:34;"I feel a lot better voting for her than I would have 10 months ago."
11:34;11:38;"Whether you like Bernie or Hillary, I think we can all agree"
11:38;11:40;"that the two-party system is trash."
11:40;11:41;"It's trash."
11:41;11:43;"And anybody who loves the two-party system"
11:43;11:47;"and who loves the Democratic Party is ultimately trash"
11:47;11:48;"because the Democrats--"
11:48;11:50;"That's a bold statement, but I'll back you up."
11:50;11:53;"No, because I'm saying I like Hillary more than I like the Democratic Party."
11:53;11:55;"Hillary's just a person. She's a human being."
11:55;11:59;"She has pros and cons. She has strengths and weaknesses."
11:59;12:00;"Here's the thing."
12:00;12:04;"We've got to make it through this sure to be traumatic general election."
12:04;12:05;"See what happens after that."
12:05;12:06;"Yeah."
12:06;12:09;"Well, Ed, we're looking forward to hearing more Grizzly Bear music."
12:09;12:11;"Thanks for calling in, and keep your head up."
12:11;12:12;"I'm going to keep it up. Thank you."
12:12;12:14;"All right. See you soon, man. Bye."

18:57;19:01;"Just like a story"
19:01;19:09;"I told you I would stay"
19:09;19:15;"Every time you try"
19:15;19:21;"Quarter, half a mile"
19:21;19:25;"Just like a story"
19:25;19:44;"I told you I would stay"
19:44;19:50;"Would you hold me?"
19:50;19:56;"Maybe sometime"
19:56;20:02;"Maybe sometime"
20:02;20:08;"Take it far"
20:08;20:14;"Would you hold me?"
20:14;20:20;"Maybe sometime"

20:51;20:58;"Sometime"
20:58;21:20;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
21:20;21:23;"That was ""Grizzly Bear"" with 2 Weeks."
21:23;21:25;"Thanks again to Ed Droste for calling in"
21:25;21:28;"and talking about Bernie."
21:28;21:29;"So you know, Jake, as we were saying,"
21:29;21:32;"these are really heavy times, brutal times."
21:32;21:35;"And before we get into your NRA research,"
21:35;21:38;"I wanted to talk about something a little lighter."
21:38;21:39;"Okay."
21:39;21:41;"I want to talk a little bit about Smash Mouth."
21:41;21:43;"You remember Smash Mouth?"
21:43;21:44;"Kind of."
21:44;21:46;"Late '90s? Early '2s?"
21:46;21:48;"Yeah, yeah, that was their heyday."
21:48;21:49;"Wait, was that the one that was like,"
21:49;21:50;"""Somebody!"""
21:50;21:51;"That one?"
21:51;21:52;"""Somebody"" what?"
21:52;21:54;"Someone once told me."
21:54;21:55;"Somebody, yeah, yeah."
21:55;21:57;"Somebody!"
21:57;21:58;"No, no, it's more like,"
21:58;22:01;"""Somebody, somebody,"
22:01;22:05;"""somebody once told me the word."""
22:05;22:07;"Anyway, I always like Smash Mouth."
22:07;22:08;"Before that, they had--"
22:08;22:09;"I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed."
22:09;22:10;"I'm not the sharpest tool."
22:10;22:12;"Before that, they had another hit called,"
22:12;22:14;"""Might as well be walking on the sun."""
22:14;22:15;"Oh, yeah."
22:15;22:18;"A little, like, late '90s, like, lounge music."
22:18;22:21;"Almost gave me kind of a Boss Stones vibe."
22:21;22:22;"Mighty Mighty."
22:22;22:24;"Yeah, I mean, Mighty Mighty Boss Stones were ska,"
22:24;22:27;"but yeah, these were like the SoCal dudes."
22:27;22:28;"Not a million miles away,"
22:28;22:31;"but I saw this Gawker article called,"
22:31;22:34;"""Smash Mouth's Desperate Endless Twitter Battle."""
22:34;22:38;"I don't like the title because the word ""desperate"""
22:38;22:40;"is already making you think something negative"
22:40;22:42;"about Smash Mouth and what they do on Twitter."
22:42;22:44;"But I guess basically the article's about"
22:44;22:47;"whoever runs the Smash Mouth Twitter account"
22:47;22:49;"is, like, tweeting at people who say"
22:49;22:51;"what they consider to be derogatory things"
22:51;22:52;"about Smash Mouth."
22:52;22:54;"It seems like most of them are about the fact"
22:54;22:56;"that the song ""All Star,"""
22:56;22:57;"the one we were just singing,"
22:57;23:00;"♪ Somebody, somebody ♪"
23:00;23:03;"was used in ""Shrek."""
23:03;23:04;"Okay."
23:04;23:07;"So you can imagine that for some kids,"
23:07;23:09;"they associate that song with that movie."
23:09;23:10;"Sure."
23:10;23:11;"It happens."
23:11;23:12;"Yeah."
23:12;23:15;"So, like, for instance, somebody tweeted about ""All Star,"""
23:15;23:17;"""I want someone to tell me that the first thing"
23:17;23:19;"they think of when they hear this song is not 'Shrek,'"""
23:19;23:21;"and then the crying, laughing emoji."
23:21;23:23;"And then Smash Mouth tweeted back at them,"
23:23;23:25;"""Well, we don't think that, since the song was already"
23:25;23:28;"on its way to number one in every country in the world"
23:28;23:30;"before the film was even finished."""
23:30;23:33;"I guess basically they don't like that people--"
23:33;23:35;"that the association with ""Shrek"" has overshadowed"
23:35;23:38;"the fact that that song was a hit in its own right."
23:38;23:41;"So they sold the song to the movie,"
23:41;23:43;"but then they're resentful of people"
23:43;23:46;"that remember the song from the movie."
23:46;23:48;"Well, but I guess people are also just trying"
23:48;23:50;"to clown on them, so, like, somebody tweeted them--"
23:50;23:52;"Well, it's funny, it's ""Shrek."""
23:52;23:53;"They should be clowned on."
23:53;23:55;"Well, hold on, I don't know about that."
23:55;23:57;"Like, somebody tweeted, ""Your best-known song"
23:57;23:58;"is because of 'Shrek.'"""
23:58;24:00;"And they wrote back, ""Oh, we didn't have a number one"
24:00;24:01;"before 'Shrek' was even thought of?"
24:01;24:02;"Come on, Sammy."""
24:02;24:04;"The person who tweeted its name was Sam."
24:04;24:06;"And then somebody--now I feel like people"
24:06;24:07;"are just, like, messing with them."
24:07;24:09;"Like, somebody tweeted, ""How does it feel"
24:09;24:12;"that your entire music career can be attributed to 'Shrek'?"""
24:12;24:14;"And they wrote, ""News to us."
24:14;24:16;"We already had a number one hit with 'Walking on the Sun,'"
24:16;24:19;"and 'All Star' was already top ten before 'Shrek' was released."""
24:19;24:21;"So that--you can understand why that one maybe got their goat."
24:21;24:23;"Somebody saying, ""How does it feel that your entire--"""
24:23;24:24;"'Cause it's just not true."
24:24;24:25;"It's simply untrue."
24:25;24:26;"It's not true."

24:27;24:29;"""Walking on the Sun."""

24:33;24:35;"It wasn't a hit because of ""Shrek."""
24:35;24:36;"It was terrible, but it was a hit."
24:36;24:39;"I actually reached out to Steve from Smash Mouth,"
24:39;24:42;"or I had my manager reach out to his manager"
24:42;24:44;"to see if we could get him on the show,"
24:44;24:46;"because, you know, I'm a guy in a band."
24:46;24:47;"Yeah."
24:47;24:49;"Well, I don't know if it's him who's tweeting this,"
24:49;24:51;"but, like, I relate to that."
24:51;24:52;"Sure."
24:52;24:53;"We've had songs--"
24:53;24:55;"There's a lot of people who know ""Vampire Weekend"""

25:01;25:03;"That was a big debate in the band."
25:03;25:05;"That's a cooler movie than ""Shrek."""
25:05;25:06;"I mean, is it?"
25:06;25:08;"I mean, I'm a 39-year-old dude,"
25:08;25:10;"so I haven't seen ""Shrek."""
25:10;25:11;"Yeah, maybe one day--"
25:11;25:12;"I'm not interested in ""Shrek."""
25:12;25:13;"Maybe one day you'll have kids."
25:13;25:14;"That's true."
25:14;25:16;"Are you gonna let your 7-year-old watch ""Step Brothers""?"
25:16;25:17;"Maybe."
25:17;25:18;"[laughs]"
25:18;25:19;"No, I'm just kidding."
25:19;25:21;"People liked ""Shrek"" when it came out."
25:21;25:22;"I get it."
25:22;25:23;"I mean, people hate on your band."
25:23;25:24;"People hate on ""Smash Mouth."""
25:24;25:26;"I could see you guys have something to talk about."
25:26;25:27;"You know--"
25:27;25:30;"Kind of mainstream-y bands that had songs in movies."
25:30;25:32;"People clown on you on ""Smash Mouth."""
25:32;25:33;"And also, just like ""Smash Mouth,"""
25:33;25:36;"""Vampire Weekend"" has a sense of devil-may-care,"

25:41;25:42;"Speaking of ""Smash Mouth,"""
25:42;25:44;"I want to return to ""Shrek"" in a moment,"
25:44;25:45;"but this made me think of a story."
25:45;25:47;"That one time I was at a party,"
25:47;25:50;"and a guy from a band from a similar era,"
25:50;25:52;"a guy from Sugar Ray,"
25:52;25:53;"and they were similar."
25:53;25:54;"They were like SoCal band."
25:54;25:56;"And I always liked Sugar Ray."
25:56;25:58;"Like, honestly, they have a few great songs."
25:58;25:59;"And he came up to me at a party,"
25:59;26:01;"and this is like the only dude--"
26:01;26:02;"And he's like, ""Oh, hey, man, I just want to say,"
26:02;26:03;"""I really like your band."""
26:03;26:04;"And I was like, ""Oh, thanks."""
26:04;26:05;"Is this the singer Mark?"
26:05;26:06;"Yeah, it's Mark."
26:06;26:07;"Mark came over and said he liked the band,"
26:07;26:08;"and I was like, ""Oh, man."""
26:08;26:09;"And I was actually, like, really psyched."
26:09;26:12;"I was like, ""Oh, that's really nice."""
26:12;26:13;"But then he said this self-deprecating thing along."
26:13;26:15;"I was like, ""Oh, but yeah, you probably--"
26:15;26:17;"""You're not trying to hear that from the dude from Sugar Ray."""
26:17;26:18;"Something about, like, ""Oh, but you probably"
26:18;26:19;"""don't like Sugar Ray."""
26:19;26:20;"And I was like, ""Actually, no, dude,"
26:20;26:21;"""I always liked Sugar Ray."""
26:21;26:22;"That's kind of touching."
26:22;26:23;"I mean, maybe I might say something like that"
26:23;26:25;"to a certain artist that I expected"
26:25;26:27;"might not like Vampire Weekend or something."
26:27;26:29;"But I was thinking, like, these dudes"
26:29;26:31;"from that late '90s era,"
26:31;26:32;"they had the misfortune--"
26:32;26:34;"They had the fortune and the misfortune"
26:34;26:36;"of being at literally the height of the record industry."
26:36;26:38;"I think '99 was the height of the industry."
26:38;26:40;"So, like, these guys who were probably, like,"
26:40;26:44;"dudes who grew up listening to, like, punk rock and hip-hop."
26:44;26:45;"Sublime."
26:45;26:46;"Yeah, even before Sublime."
26:46;26:48;"They probably could have been, like, Sublime."
26:48;26:50;"And then they come out at this moment"
26:50;26:52;"where there's, like, so much money,"
26:52;26:54;"and they're, like, on TRL and MTV,"
26:54;26:56;"and, like, maybe people didn't really"
26:56;26:58;"give them a chance or something."
26:58;26:59;"Right."
26:59;27:00;"I'll be honest."
27:00;27:01;"I always, like-- I was more into Sugar Ray"
27:01;27:03;"than I was into Smash Mouth."
27:03;27:04;"Oh, yeah, I fully agreed on that."
27:04;27:05;"They had some great songs."
27:05;27:08;"♪ I wanna do it again ♪"
27:08;27:12;"♪ There's no time to think 'bout the start and/or the end ♪"

27:15;27:17;"♪ My mother, she told me so ♪"
27:17;27:19;"I know, I could see them being self-conscious of, like,"
27:19;27:20;"""Look, we made a ton of money."
27:20;27:24;"""Deep down, we know we're not the greatest band on Earth."""
27:24;27:26;"Like, our timing was great, but--"
27:26;27:29;"But also, like, these days, people, like, elitists"
27:29;27:32;"are more into pop music back then."
27:32;27:33;"Oh, yeah."
27:33;27:35;"So, if you can't pop from, like, a critical elitist perspective,"
27:35;27:36;"you're dead."
27:36;27:37;"Yeah."
27:37;27:38;"And, you know, actually, I was telling this story"
27:38;27:42;"to somebody who used to work with Franz Ferdinand,"
27:42;27:45;"and they told a similar story about the singer from ""Papa Roach"""
27:45;27:47;"at, like, a radio show coming over to Franz Ferdinand"

27:49;27:50;"They're from Scotland."
27:50;27:52;"They have no idea who he is."

27:59;28:01;"""Like, I don't know. We're, like, on the dole."""
28:01;28:02;"And they were like, ""Oh, cool."""
28:02;28:05;"And it was, like, a similar thing where, like, I also really--"
28:05;28:07;"I felt like a lot of guys in bands from that era"
28:07;28:08;"really had it raw."
28:08;28:11;"'Cause I think, like, you're like the dudes from ""Papa Roach"""
28:11;28:14;"or, like, some of, like, the lesser dudes in ""Limp Bizkit."""
28:14;28:15;"You're just, like, doing your thing,"
28:15;28:18;"and then, like, you're getting blasted out to the country"
28:18;28:21;"in such a huge way that, like, you probably share"
28:21;28:24;"a lot of, like, influences with these kind of--"
28:24;28:26;"like, the hipster people."
28:26;28:27;"Sure."
28:27;28:28;"The me's of the world."
28:28;28:29;"Right."
28:29;28:30;"But then you have this-- I don't know."
28:30;28:32;"Yeah, I mean, you're into Velvet Underground"
28:32;28:34;"or punk rock or whatever, and then you're--"
28:34;28:37;"all of a sudden, you meet this guy named Fred Durst."
28:37;28:38;"You guys start a band."
28:38;28:40;"You're playing bass in ""Limp Bizkit."""
28:40;28:41;"Deep down in your soul, you're like,"
28:41;28:43;"""I was just-- I was playing in a band."""
28:43;28:45;"Like, the gig kind of escalated quickly."
28:45;28:47;"Turns out Fred's a total douchebag."
28:47;28:49;"Oh, I wasn't gonna take it there with Fred."
28:49;28:51;"I bet Fred Durst is kind-- I don't know enough about him,"
28:51;28:52;"but I bet he's kind of cool."
28:52;28:53;"He doesn't seem that dope."
28:53;28:55;"I think everybody should be assumed cool"
28:55;28:57;"until proven otherwise."
28:57;29:04;"♪"
29:04;29:06;"But yeah, so as your band escalates,"
29:06;29:08;"there's like-- it's almost like politics,"
29:08;29:10;"and then it gets polarized."
29:10;29:33;"♪"
29:33;29:36;"People who, like, are incredibly loved and successful"
29:36;29:39;"but are so traumatized by, like, the haters."
29:39;29:40;"Because that's true of all these guys."
29:40;29:42;"Like, a lot of people think they can, like,"
29:42;29:43;"clown on Smash Mouth or whatever."
29:43;29:45;"And maybe-- I don't know."
29:45;29:46;"I'll have to look through more of it."
29:46;29:47;"But, like, they can clown on these people"
29:47;29:48;"'cause they're like, ""Oh, they had a huge hit."""
29:48;29:50;"Like, they're untouchable, but then these people"
29:50;29:51;"are actually, like, very sensitive about it."
29:51;29:52;"- Sure. - I mean, classic."
29:52;29:53;"Classic story."
29:53;29:55;"But it's funny because, like, you know,"
29:55;29:57;"maybe in 20 years, people will be looking back"
29:57;29:59;"and be like, ""Yo, Smash Mouth and Sugar Ray."
29:59;30:00;"""That was cool."""
30:00;30:03;"Like, ""I hate all that, like, hipster stuff"

30:04;30:06;"Yeah, well, ""Pavement sucks."" Like--"
30:06;30:07;"- It's possible. - It's possible."
30:07;30:09;"But, you know, what's funny is, like,"
30:09;30:11;"you know who the original dude who went pop"
30:11;30:13;"and got traumatized by the haters is?"
30:13;30:14;"- Yep, I do. - Who?"
30:14;30:15;"- Phil Collins. - Oh, yeah."
30:15;30:17;"Yeah, man, we're on the same wavelength, man."
30:17;30:20;"So, Phil Collins, you know, he played in Genesis,"
30:20;30:23;"like, super heady prog rock."
30:23;30:25;"Joined in, like, '72."
30:25;30:26;"He's playing drums."
30:26;30:28;"You got Peter Gabriel putting on face paint, lead singer."
30:28;30:30;"And even then, like, Phil Collins plays drums"
30:30;30:33;"on, like, some of, like, the early Brian Eno stuff."
30:33;30:34;"He was in the mix."
30:34;30:35;"Bowie and stuff. Yeah."
30:35;30:37;"Yeah, Bowie. He was, like, a step away from Bowie."
30:37;30:38;"- Yeah. - I'm sure he knew Bowie."
30:38;30:39;"Oh, sure."
30:39;30:42;"And then, in the '80s, he becomes a pop star."
30:42;30:44;"And, you know, but first of all,"
30:44;30:46;"his first hit single is ""In the Air Tonight."""
30:46;30:47;"Right."
30:47;30:49;"Which, in the '80s, it's almost like"
30:49;30:51;"people almost tried to treat it like a joke."
30:51;30:53;"- He did his kind of, like, schmaltzy stuff. - Schmaltzy, yeah."
30:53;30:55;"But even now, like, a lot of people go back"
30:55;30:56;"and listen to that '80s Phil Collins stuff"
30:56;30:58;"and be like, ""Yo, it's just good pop music."
30:58;31:00;"- Great voice."" - Very well written."
31:00;31:02;"And then you, like, read some of these later articles"
31:02;31:04;"where people are interviewing him."
31:04;31:06;"There's, like, a Rolling Stone one a few years back."
31:06;31:09;"And this is a guy who's, like, one of the biggest artists in the world."
31:09;31:11;"And they're interviewing him, and they're kind of like,"
31:11;31:12;"""So, man, like, what have you been doing?"""
31:12;31:14;"He, like, lives in Switzerland now."
31:14;31:17;"And he's like, ""I don't know. Sometimes I make music."
31:17;31:19;"I bet, like, no one really wants to hear it."""
31:19;31:21;"And it's like, ""What are you talking about, man? Like, you're huge."""
31:21;31:23;"And he was like, ""No, I know I'm a joke."
31:23;31:25;"I know people just hate me."""
31:25;31:26;"And this is, like, Phil Collins."
31:26;31:28;"- It's so heavy. It's so sad. - It's so heavy."
31:28;31:31;"And it's also sad because, like, this is a guy who was cool."
31:31;31:33;"- Yeah. - Then he got huge."
31:33;31:36;"Then he was kind of, like, a punchline for, like, a certain brand of"
31:36;31:40;"kind of snarky music critic or music fan."
31:40;31:43;"Now we listen back to his music like it's classic."
31:43;31:44;"Like, a lot of that music is great."
31:44;31:46;"In fact, you know, the guys in Chromio,"
31:46;31:48;"because they always loved Phil Collins."
31:48;31:50;"You know, they're not really from, like, the indie rock world."
31:50;31:53;"They're kind of more from this, like, hip-hop, funky world."
31:53;31:55;"And they had this story about the first time they went to the U.K.,"
31:55;31:58;"an enemy journalist was like, ""So who are some of your biggest influences?"""
31:58;31:59;"And they were like, ""Phil Collins."""
31:59;32:01;"Let's say this is, like, 2003."
32:01;32:03;"And the guy was just like, ""Come on."""
32:03;32:04;"That guy just thought it was a joke."
32:04;32:07;"These days, if a kid said they were influenced by Phil Collins,"
32:07;32:09;"they'd be like, ""Yes, it was everybody anyway."""
32:09;32:11;"- Right. - But then it was still, like, a joke."
32:11;32:13;"You know, he has an autobiography coming out this fall."
32:13;32:15;"- Oh, Collins does? - Yeah."
32:15;32:17;"- Oh, that's going to be great. - Really looking forward to that."
32:17;32:22;"This summer, Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel are sharing the bill at Hollywood Bowl."
32:22;32:24;"Maybe they'll play together. Maybe they'll do a song together."
32:24;32:26;"Who's going to open for who?"
32:26;32:28;"That's a tough one. You're probably going to flip a coin."
32:28;32:30;"Can you imagine them, like, hugging it out?"
32:30;32:34;"- I bet. - Peter Gabriel left Genesis in 1975,"
32:34;32:36;"which is so early."
32:36;32:38;"And then imagine their relationship in the mid-'80s"
32:38;32:40;"when Phil was at the height of his pop stardom."
32:40;32:42;"And actually, so was Peter Gabriel."
32:42;32:45;"They were both, like, huge stars, but Peter Gabriel was--"
32:45;32:49;"Peter Gabriel was probably getting, like, ""Rolling Stone,"" ""Album of the Year."""
32:49;32:51;"Like, he had ""In Your Eyes,"" but he was still like,"
32:51;32:55;"♪ In your eyes, the light, the heat ♪"
32:55;32:57;"So you could imagine that back then,"
32:57;33:01;"Phil Collins was like, ""Oh, Peter Gabriel, you think you're cooler than that?"""
33:01;33:03;"- He was the cool kid. - Yeah, Peter Gabriel."
33:03;33:07;"- And now it's like they're just two, like, older-- - Pushing 70."
33:07;33:09;"- Bald British men."
33:09;33:11;"You know what else that kind of makes me think of?"
33:11;33:14;"We're really jumping around today, but did you read Keith Richards' book?"
33:14;33:17;"- Parts of it. - So it's a very long book."
33:17;33:19;"- Yeah. - I'm amazed that I read the whole thing."
33:19;33:22;"There's a part where he talks about-- so, you know, like, in the '60s,"
33:22;33:25;"for a lot of people, you defined yourself by,"
33:25;33:27;"if you liked the Stones or the Beatles,"
33:27;33:31;"for a certain type of, like, probably young American kid."
33:31;33:34;"- Yeah. - Some people thought the Beatles were safe,"
33:34;33:36;"and if you were a badass, you liked the Stones."
33:36;33:38;"And they had, like, a friendly rivalry or something."
33:38;33:42;"There's a part where he's talking about, like, being in the Caribbean,"
33:42;33:45;"like he's in Jamaica or something, and he, like, rented, like, some massive villa."
33:45;33:49;"And then he's like, ""And then I realized that the guy next door"
33:49;33:51;"renting the villa next to me was Paul McCartney."""
33:51;33:54;"And I just, like, went over and I said, ""What's up, man?"""
33:54;33:57;"And these are guys who probably were, like, fairly, you know, rival,"
33:57;33:59;"like, envious of each other back in the day."
33:59;34:01;"And he's like, ""And we just ended up hanging out every day."
34:01;34:04;"We just take long walks and, like, reminisce about back in the day."""
34:04;34:08;"- Is this in, like, in the '70s or the '80s? - No, this is, like, in 2003."
34:08;34:10;"- Wow. - 'Cause you just picture, like, these dudes"
34:10;34:12;"who maybe at some point represented, like, polar opposites."
34:12;34:14;"- Sure. - But now, of course, we look at them,"
34:14;34:16;"we're like, ""What are you talking about? Polar opposites?"
34:16;34:18;"The Beatles and this-- it's, like, just dad music."""
34:18;34:21;"- It's like ham and eggs. - Yeah, they go together."
34:21;34:24;"So I'm just picturing, like, Keith and Paul McCartney"
34:24;34:27;"just, like, taking long walks on the beach and just being, like--"
34:27;34:29;"And especially when you consider at that age,"
34:29;34:31;"it's, like, how many, like, their friends are dead."
34:31;34:34;"- Yeah. - Even their, like, the main dudes,"
34:34;34:37;"John Lennon, George Harrison, and these two dudes are left."
34:37;34:41;"I'm sure at that age, hopefully, like, the similarities bond you together more."
34:41;34:43;"- Yeah. - It's like you could picture, like,"
34:43;34:46;"with these dudes who've had problems in our era, like, Drake and Meek Mill."
34:46;34:48;"Just, like, flash forward 50 years."
34:48;34:51;"Drake and Meek Mill, like, Nicki Minaj married somebody."
34:51;34:54;"I'm not-- I mean, I'm not trying to cast doubt"
34:54;34:56;"on the strength of their relationship."
34:56;34:58;"- How dare you? - Let's imagine this, like,"
34:58;35:00;"Nicki Minaj isn't even in the picture anymore, and it's, like,"
35:00;35:02;"they just see, like, their rooms are next to each other in Vegas,"
35:02;35:05;"and it's just kind of like, ""What's up, man?"""
35:05;35:07;"And it's like, ""Hey, man, you want to go hit the buffet?"""
35:07;35:09;"- Yeah, man, time does that. - Yeah."
35:09;35:11;"I love to think about the kind of awkward moment"
35:11;35:13;"in the conversation between Paul and Keith,"
35:13;35:15;"and the conversation kind of peters out."
35:15;35:18;"And then one of them's just like, ""Yeah, I don't know, anyway."""
35:18;35:21;"You know? Just, like, trying to, like, ""What else?"
35:21;35:24;"You want to get a drink? You want to come inside, man?"""
35:24;35:26;"Like..."
35:26;35:28;"""Hey, I'm beat, man. I'm gonna turn in."""
35:28;35:32;"Keith is like, ""Yeah, I have to go FaceTime my daughter."""
35:32;35:35;"""Go FaceTime my great-grandchild."""
35:35;35:37;"Or just, like, the two of them sitting at a table together,"
35:37;35:39;"and they're both texting."
35:39;35:41;"Right."
35:41;35:43;"Oh, God."
35:43;35:45;"Well, on that note, who do you like better,"
35:45;35:47;"the Beatles or the Stones?"
35:47;35:49;"You know what's funny, man? I mean, when I was a kid,"
35:49;35:51;"it was, like, all about the Beatles."
35:51;35:53;"- Right. - And now I'm, like, late 30s."
35:53;35:55;"- I listen to the Stones more. - Yeah?"
35:55;35:57;"What's your favorite Stones song?"
35:57;35:59;"- Probably ""Tumbling Dice."" - ""Tumbling Dice."""
35:59;36:02;"I say ""die."" I think people say ""dice."""
36:02;36:04;"Dice or die."
36:04;36:07;"Well, the song is-- it's called ""Tumbling Dice."""
36:07;36:09;"Yeah, but people say ""Tumbling Dice."""
36:09;36:11;"Because he's-- is that how he sings it?"
36:11;36:13;"Maybe, I think so."

45:47;45:53;"Now it's not likely to say the right thing."
45:53;45:59;"But you could have called to let me know."
45:59;46:04;"But you called me twice, didn't understand it."
46:04;46:09;"So now we're both alone."
46:09;46:14;"Well, I've been waiting for this weekend."
46:14;46:21;"I thought that maybe we could see a show."
46:21;46:27;"I never dreamed I'd have this feeling."
46:27;46:32;"You're easily leaving."
46:32;46:35;"That's why I don't go out."
46:35;46:37;"You didn't show up that night."
46:37;46:43;"There must be some misunderstanding."
46:43;46:49;"There must be some kind of mistake."
46:49;46:54;"I was waiting in the rain for hours."
46:54;46:58;"You were late."
46:58;47:01;"Since then I've been running around."
47:01;47:04;"Trying to find you."
47:04;47:10;"I went to the places that we always go."
47:10;47:16;"I rang your house without your answer."
47:16;47:18;"Jumped in my car."
47:18;47:22;"I went round and round."
47:22;47:25;"I stood on the leading."
47:25;47:27;"But you were just leaving."
47:27;47:33;"Oh, there must be some misunderstanding."
47:33;47:39;"There must be some kind of mistake."
47:39;47:45;"There must be some misunderstanding."
47:45;47:51;"There must be some kind of mistake."
47:51;47:57;"There must be some kind of misunderstanding."
48:03;48:05;"Beats 1."
48:05;48:09;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
48:09;48:13;"Music so hot it'll melt your face off."
48:13;48:16;"This is Jake's NRA segment."
48:16;48:20;"So NRA describes itself as America's longest running civil rights organization."
48:20;48:24;"Most people that I roll with don't describe the NRA as a civil rights organization."
48:24;48:25;"But interesting."
48:25;48:27;"What did you learn about the NRA?"
48:27;48:32;"Because that is something that unfortunately a lot of us who kind of just follow the news,"
48:32;48:35;"another mass shooting, we feel awful."
48:35;48:37;"This debate flares up."
48:37;48:39;"It happens over and over again."
48:39;48:41;"The NRA comes, the NRA goes."
48:41;48:44;"But it's like, yeah, weirdly I don't know that much about the NRA's history."
48:44;48:45;"Right."
48:45;48:50;"So yeah, like I said, they are self-proclaimed the longest standing civil rights organization in the US."
48:50;48:56;"They were founded in 1871 in New York by a bunch of civil war veterans."
48:56;48:58;"Union. Union vets."
48:58;48:59;"Yeah."
48:59;49:05;"And they were dismayed by the terrible marksmanship of the Union soldiers during the war."
49:05;49:08;"And one of the founders of the NRA, there's a quote, he's like,"
49:08;49:12;"""Out of 10 soldiers, only one knew how to use the sight on his rifle,"
49:12;49:15;"and only one could hit the broadside of a barn."""
49:15;49:20;"So these dudes are like, let's start an advocacy group for competency with weapons and marksmanship."
49:20;49:27;"So their first lobbying effort is to get 25 grand from the New York State Legislature to build a range to learn how to shoot."
49:27;49:30;"And then that's what the vibe is for a long time."
49:30;49:37;"And then the first major federal firearms laws are passed in the 20th century in 1934."
49:37;49:40;"And the NRA is like fully on board."
49:40;49:46;"And it's coming out of all the gangster stuff that was happening in the Prohibition era, like Al Capone."
49:46;49:50;"And so there's the National Firearms Act of 1934."
49:50;49:54;"And basically, like, weapons are divided into two categories, Title I, Title II."
49:54;49:56;"Title I is like hunting rifles and shotguns."
49:56;50:00;"Title II is like sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, silencers, things like that."
50:00;50:03;"Weapons of war, weapons designed to kill lots of people."
50:03;50:07;"Right. They're not banned, but they're heavily regulated,"
50:07;50:12;"and they're under the jurisdiction of the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms."
50:12;50:17;"They put a $200 tax on the guns, which in that day was equivalent to $3,500."
50:17;50:20;"So it was, like, prohibitively expensive to buy a gun."
50:20;50:23;"That sort of chilled stuff out for a while."
50:23;50:29;"The next major chapter in gun control was 1968, which is a classic year on this show."
50:29;50:32;"Oh, 1968, watershed year in American history."
50:32;50:39;"Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Gun Control Act, which came in the wake of the assassination of John F. Kennedy,"
50:39;50:44;"and then Malcolm X, and then Martin Luther King, and then Robert Kennedy."
50:44;50:52;"The gun that was used to kill JFK was purchased by mail order from an NRA magazine called American Rifleman."
50:52;50:55;"That's not a good look for the NRA."
50:55;50:56;"No, that's rough."
50:56;50:58;"So the president of the NRA at that time was like,"
50:58;51:04;"""We do not think any sane American can object to placing into this bill the instrument which killed the president of the United States."""
51:04;51:13;"So he's on board with, like, ""We've got to ban mail order guns, and we have to prohibit felons and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns."""
51:13;51:18;"So in other words, he's basically like, ""Yes, it should be harder to get a gun. Clearly it is too easy."
51:18;51:22;"Somebody ordered a gun and killed the president. It is too easy to get a gun."""
51:22;51:24;"This is the head of the NRA in 1968."
51:24;51:33;"That passes, but there is a seed within the NRA that starts to emerge that's very upset by the Gun Control Act of 1968."
51:33;51:39;"So in the 1970s, the tone that we know the NRA kind of has today is established."
51:39;51:40;"It's firmly established."
51:40;51:44;"The NRA is really split about the Gun Control Act of '68."
51:44;51:49;"The leadership is, like, all on board, but there's a lot of dissidence within the organization that hate it."
51:49;51:53;"A lot of the organization's leaders think they should just continue to have the organization promote marksmanship and hunting."
51:53;51:57;"They want to move the headquarters to Colorado and set up a big hunting range."
51:57;52:03;"And there's this other group that's like, ""No, we want to set up shop in D.C. and advocate against gun control."""
52:03;52:13;"So in the early '70s, there's a bill going through the Congress that's going to ban guns called Saturday Night Specials, which are cheap, inexpensive handguns."
52:13;52:14;"Small guns."
52:14;52:17;"Yeah, sort of like your classic 1970s stick-up man out of Dirty Harry or something."
52:17;52:18;"Right."
52:18;52:19;"Just a crappy pistol."
52:19;52:20;"Yeah."
52:20;52:27;"Now, the bill is criticized for having racist overtones because it was a gun very prevalent in the inner city, which was predominantly black."
52:27;52:28;"Right."
52:28;52:30;"But it's a very popular bill."
52:30;52:35;"And this guy, Maxwell Rich, a Mormon guy who's the head of the NRA at that point, he's all in."
52:35;52:36;"He loves this ban."
52:36;52:37;"Yeah."
52:37;52:39;"But there's a dude named Harlan Carter."
52:39;52:40;"This is where we get dark."
52:40;52:41;"Yeah."
52:41;52:42;"In the mid '70s."
52:42;52:44;"Now, Harlan Carter is from Texas."
52:44;52:45;"He's born in 1913."
52:45;52:49;"His dad was a big wig in the U.S. Border Patrol down in Texas."
52:49;52:52;"Harlan goes on to have a big career in the Border Patrol."
52:52;53:00;"He was actually in 1931 convicted of murdering a 15-year-old Mexican-American kid by shooting him in the chest with a shotgun."
53:00;53:07;"But the conviction was overturned shortly thereafter by the Texas Court of Appeals, and the judge wasn't on the up and up with the jury."
53:07;53:08;"Oh, my God."
53:08;53:16;"The 1977 NRA convention in Cincinnati, Harlan Carter is able to oust Maxwell Rich, who was the kind-vibed Mormon."
53:16;53:17;"Oh, wow."
53:17;53:19;"And he comes out hard."
53:19;53:24;"He's just like, ""We can win it on a simple concept, no compromise, no gun legislation."""
53:24;53:31;"And he famously is quoted as saying, ""The use of guns by violent criminals and the mentally ill is the price we pay for freedom,"" which is like a classic--"
53:31;53:32;"Oh!"
53:32;53:33;"--a classic--"
53:33;53:35;"Rewind."
53:35;53:36;"Let me hear that again."
53:36;53:37;"[rewind sound]"
53:37;53:42;"--""The use of guns by violent criminals and the mentally ill is the price we pay for freedom."""
53:42;53:44;"It's basically like the extremists took over."
53:44;53:45;"In the mid '70s, yeah."
53:45;53:50;"And so right around then is when the lobbying--they weren't even a lobbying organization until then."
53:50;53:51;"Yeah."
53:51;53:53;"So this dude, Harlan Carter, like changes the tone--"
53:53;53:54;"A murderer."
53:54;53:55;"--with his insurrection."
53:55;53:57;"The lobbying arm is established."
53:57;54:01;"1980, Reagan is the first presidential candidate to get an endorsement by the NRA."
54:01;54:04;"Until 1980, they were just like not even involved."
54:04;54:06;"Two months after he's inaugurated, he's shot--"
54:06;54:07;"Yeah."
54:07;54:09;"--by John Hinckley in that shooting."
54:09;54:10;"And then Harlan Carter weighs in."
54:10;54:11;"There's a quote here."
54:11;54:18;"He's like, ""You know sadly why President Reagan isn't here, but you heard President Reagan himself advocate no restriction on those who commit no crimes."
54:18;54:24;"He rejected the maudlin enticements of the press to say something in favor of gun control while he lay wounded."""
54:24;54:26;"So he's just like, Reagan's a tough guy."
54:26;54:32;"Even though he got shot, he's not going to stoop to the level of the press and maybe talk about gun control."
54:32;54:34;"In the '80s, the NRA is fully mainstream."
54:34;54:35;"Right."
54:35;54:36;"The membership more than triples."
54:36;54:38;"Their fundraising goes through the roof."
54:38;54:41;"And sort of the vibe that we know today is firmly entrenched."
54:41;54:48;"And from there on out, it's sort of like a seesaw battle of progressive politicians trying to pass some gun control legislation"
54:48;54:53;"and then the NRA filing lawsuits in various states that they might be receptive to"
54:53;54:59;"and sort of trying to squash those new laws by having the courts sort of go one way or the other."
55:26;55:28;"When I think about this stuff, it just like mushrooms out."
55:28;55:31;"There's just like so many laws that sort of almost happen."
55:31;55:37;"In the wake of yet another horrendous mass shooting, you see people throwing out statistics."
55:37;55:43;"I haven't independently verified these, but you know, like a huge percentage of Americans, a vast majority, want stricter controls on guns."
55:43;55:44;"Yeah."
55:44;55:52;"So you would imagine there's probably a lot of NRA members who maybe gun ownership is important to them, but probably don't have an AR-15 at home."
55:52;55:54;"Yeah, absolutely."
55:54;55:57;"I mean, like the moderate voices are going to be quiet."
55:57;55:59;"It gets hard to talk about."
55:59;56:07;"It'd be one thing if the discourse was like, ""Hey, should like a suburban parent have a little handgun in a lockbox in their closet?"""
56:07;56:12;"Like it'd be one thing if that's what the debate was, but like the debate is literally about weapons of war."
56:12;56:15;"Crazy semi-automatic weapons, yeah."
56:15;56:22;"All right, well, Jake, the way forward in terms of sensible gun control in this country is complicated,"
56:22;56:29;"but at the very least we appreciate you digging in the crates and giving us some context on the history of the NRA, so thank you for that."
56:29;56:32;"Let's listen to some music to kind of cleanse our palates."
56:32;56:37;"What's like the opposite of a brutal song about gun violence?"
56:37;56:39;"""You are the sunshine of my life."""
56:39;56:40;"What song is that?"
56:40;56:42;"""You are the sunshine of my life."""
56:42;56:43;"By who?"
56:43;56:44;"Stevie Wonder."
56:44;56:45;"""Life,"" not ""Love,"" sorry."
56:45;56:46;"Oh, ""Sunshine of my Life."""
56:46;56:47;"Yeah, yeah."
56:47;56:48;"That's a good idea."
56:48;56:51;"Here is Stevie Wonder with ""You are the Sunshine of My Life."""
56:51;56:58;"""You are the sunshine of my life."
56:58;57:06;"That's why I'll always be around."
57:06;57:13;"You are the apple of my eye."
57:13;57:20;"Forever you'll stay in my heart."
57:20;57:27;"I feel like this is the beginning."
57:27;57:35;"Though I've loved you for a million years."
57:35;57:50;"And if I thought our love was a day, I'd find myself drowning in my own tears."
57:50;57:56;"You are the sunshine of my life."
57:56;58:04;"That's why I'll always stay around."
58:04;58:11;"You are the apple of my eye."
58:11;58:18;"Forever you'll stay in my heart."
58:18;58:25;"You must have known that I was lonely."
58:25;58:32;"Because you came to my rescue."
58:32;58:38;"And I know that this must be heaven."
58:38;58:44;"How could so much love be inside of you?"
58:44;58:51;"Oh, you are the sunshine of my life."
58:51;58:53;"Yeah."
58:53;58:59;"That's why I'll always stay around."
58:59;59:07;"You are the apple of my eye."
59:07;59:14;"Forever you'll stay in my heart."

01:08:16;01:08:18;"Something on a lighter note, feel it."
01:08:18;01:08:21;"In dark times, it's important to have some positive music."
01:08:21;01:08:26;"So we're gonna do, only when we really have our together"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"do we do the double top five."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"I love it."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"- It's time for the top five."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Five on iTunes."
01:08:34;01:08:38;"- So people know that every show"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"we always do at least the top five songs on iTunes."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- Yeah."
01:08:42;01:08:43;"- But the double top five,"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"these are good for shows when it's just you and me."
01:08:45;01:08:50;"Just two dudes, two brews, it's going head to head."
01:08:50;01:08:54;"And this is where we compare the top five songs of today"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"with the top five songs of another year."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"And this week we picked 1968."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"So we're gonna compare and contrast 2016 with 1968."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"So 1968 for our younger listeners"
01:09:05;01:09:08;"or our listeners who don't care about history."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"Why was that such an important year in American history?"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"We talked a little bit about--"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"- The Gun Control Act."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"- The Gun Control Act of 1968."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"What else was happening in '68?"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"I guess was '68 the summer of love or is that '67?"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"- '67."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"- '68 was the year after the summer of love."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"- I mean '68's coming up a lot this year"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"because of how crazy the elections are"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"and people are anticipating demonstrations"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"and whatnot at these conventions upcoming this summer."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"- Right, things got really crazy."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"The cops started beating people"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"- Right, it's sort of looked at as just generally"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"a very tumultuous year in the history of America."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"- Yeah."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"- Martin Luther King was killed, Robert Kennedy was killed."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"There were riots nationwide following"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"the assassination of Martin Luther King."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- Richard Nixon was elected."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"The Vietnam War was at its height."
01:09:52;01:09:55;"I feel like it's a year that's sort of in the ether."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"- Right, another tumultuous year."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"- And we did this a few weeks ago"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"and it was really funny 'cause all the songs"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"in the top five in '68 were like the most lame--"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"- Bubble gum."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"- Just totally."
01:10:05;01:10:06;"- Well let's see what we got."
01:10:06;01:10:11;"So we're gonna start with the number five song of 1968"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"and this was MacArthur Park by Richard Harris."
01:10:16;01:10:19;"- This week of June of 1968."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- Oh this is a good song, it's a weird song."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"I know this one."
01:10:21;01:10:25;"Someone left the cake out in the rain."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"- Oh really?"
01:10:26;01:10:31;"- Just picture this, just like dark time in America."
01:10:31;01:10:31;"- Yeah."

01:11:59;01:12:00;"- Someone left a cake out in the rain."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"- We could look at, maybe the cake is a metaphor"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"for a relationship or for America."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"- Could be, man."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- Someone left the, you know it's funny,"

01:12:12;01:12:13;"- What's that?"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"- Actually, somebody told me that,"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"somebody that I know in the songwriting community"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"told me it's about eating by the ocean."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"- Eating, yeah."

01:31:51;01:31:53;"- I mean, who do you think's at the 11 p.m."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Friday night screening?"
01:31:55;01:31:56;"- Weird, sad dudes."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"- A couple weird, single guys."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"Okay, I could picture the single adults,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"who are just like, already saw everything,"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"are just like, you know what,"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"I just wanna see something light."
01:32:05;01:32:09;"There's probably also the kinda like, bad parents."
01:32:09;01:32:12;"Or not bad, but like, young, don't give a parents,"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"who are kinda like, in there with like,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"the three year old, who's like,"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"daddy I'm tired, he's like, yeah, here's some Coke."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:32:18;01:32:19;"- There's definitely that vibe."
01:32:19;01:32:22;"- And also just like, teenagers, who are just out."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"- Apparently teenagers don't go to the movies anymore."
01:32:24;01:32:25;"- That makes me sad."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"- Why man, they got iPads, Instagram."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"- That's an important, shared,"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"collective cultural experience, I mean."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"- Yeah, but now they can watch Netflix at home."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"- Yeah, I mean, that's fine."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"- Yeah, I'm sorry that the teens of today"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"can't go sit in a dark theater,"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"and get yelled at, every time they wanna comment"
01:32:43;01:32:47;"on the film, instead they have to have a Google Hangout,"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"with eight of their best friends,"
01:32:48;01:32:53;"while they watch all 12 episodes of a season of television."
01:32:53;01:32:57;"- I'm just advocating for the completely immersive"
01:32:57;01:33:00;"experience of watching a movie, not looking at your phone."
01:33:00;01:33:03;"- I hate it, I hate it, I'm a three screen guy."
01:33:03;01:33:03;"- Well."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"- You ever do three screens?"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"- This friendship is on thin ice."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"- Have you ever done four screens?"
01:33:08;01:33:12;"- No, I mean, I've done two, cell phone and TV."
01:33:12;01:33:16;"- So you've never been at home, throw on the TV,"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"you got your phone, maybe texting somebody,"
01:33:19;01:33:22;"got your laptop cracked open for some research."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"- Yeah, okay, I've done that."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"- So you've done three screens."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"- Yeah, I've done like--"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"- And then maybe got the iPad."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"- Like Bill Maher or something is on the TV,"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"I'm reading about the NRA."
01:33:32;01:33:33;"- Right."
01:33:33;01:33:33;"- And the--"
01:33:33;01:33:34;"- And some late texting."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"- And someone texts me."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"- Okay."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"- All right, you're a three screener."
01:33:38;01:33:42;"Should we listen to the song?"

01:44:35;01:44:45;"Welcome back to ""Time Crisis."""
01:44:45;01:44:47;"Okay, I think we did our thing, man."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"-Wait, so you've done four screens? -What?"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"-You've done four screens? -Am I a four-screener?"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"-Yeah, have you done it? -Oh, absolutely."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"-Double laptop? -No, not double laptop,"
01:44:55;01:44:58;"although I do own two laptops, if you're interested."
01:44:58;01:45:01;"-If anybody at home thought that I was the kind of guy"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"who only has one laptop... -So you do TV."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"-You're doing double. -I could do five screens."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"-But seriously, what's your max? -Okay."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"-Let's be serious here. -Okay, seriously,"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"I've definitely done four screens"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"because I have the TV on."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"-Yep. -Obviously something I'm not"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"super invested in."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"-CNN on mute. -Yeah, CNN,"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"some garbage like that."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"And then I got the laptop, I got the phone."
01:45:24;01:45:26;"-Mostly for texting. -Yeah."
01:45:26;01:45:28;"And I know there's, like, you know some people"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"like text on their laptop all the time now?"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"-I'll do that. -Really, you do that?"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"-I like it. -Oh, that's funny."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"I wouldn't take you for that."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"Well, see, it turns a three-screen situation"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"into a two-screen."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"I'm very traditional, I only text on my phone."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Okay, now, here's when I do four screens."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"You got something lightweight on the TV,"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"you got the phone, you're texting."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"-Yep. -Or WhatsAppping."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"No, I really, I just text."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"I'm like, got my email open,"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"like, full screen, or maybe I'm on"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"Twitter or something."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"And then maybe finally on the iPad,"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"I read books on my iPad."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"So maybe I might have a book open."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"-Really? -To cross-reference."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Or I might just have, like, yet another thing on the iPad."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Here's one. If, let's say the CNN"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"was on mute, maybe I'd be"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"playing music off the iPad."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"And then, you know, occasionally checking in."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"So you're playing the Troll soundtrack on the iPad."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"-Troll soundtrack on the iPad. -CNN on mute."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"CNN on mute on the boob tube."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Texting with your mom."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Texting with my mom."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And then tweeting at my mom"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"on the laptop."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Tweeting at Smash Mouth."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"Wait, there was something that came up in the top five"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"that I wanted to say before we wrapped up. Oh yeah, Shania Twain"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"came up briefly, because we were talking about Mutt Lang."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"This is a fun fact for people"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"at home. This is something I think about a lot."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"So, we mentioned earlier in the show that"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Phil Collins is a resident of Switzerland."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"And I'm not trying to put anybody on blast."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"I think the primary reason"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"that a lot of wealthy people live in Switzerland"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"is just because of the"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"natural majesty of the"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"Alps and the lakes."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"The fact that you can kind of get"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"out of paying taxes there, I think is pretty"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"low on the priority list of people. I think people move to"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"Switzerland because of the natural beauty,"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"the very"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"high quality chocolate, the booming"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"pharmaceutical industry,"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"and then the fact that you don't have to pay tax, whatever."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"I'm just saying a lot of international"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"wealth resides in Switzerland."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"There's no income tax there?"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"I don't know if there's no income tax, but"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"there's little to no income tax."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"I wonder why that... If you establish residency,"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"if you're a resident of especially"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"a place with fairly high taxes, like the UK,"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"if you establish residency in Switzerland,"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"you're absolutely paying less in taxes."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"That's not what this is about."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"My point is that Phil Collins"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"lives in Switzerland in a small town"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"on Lake Geneva,"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"as do Mutt Lang and Shania Twain."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Does Clooney have a place? No, he's in Italy."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"He's got the Lake Como crib."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"It was always interesting to me"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"when I realized, ""Wow, these people live..."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"I wonder if they ever see each other. They live probably"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"within 20 miles of each other in Switzerland."""
01:47:58;01:48:00;"And Shania"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"and Mutt Lang,"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"from what I've read, they split up,"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"but they have children together."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"So they decided, ""You know what? We're not going to"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"make this easy on our kid."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"We have the money to do it. We're going to"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"create a situation in which the kid can go"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"back and forth between... I don't know if it's wings of the house"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"or houses next door."" They built"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"something to make life easy on their kid,"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"which seems very reasonable."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"Once I was talking to somebody who"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"was in a band that"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"recorded with Mutt Lang."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"I was like, ""Oh, so you recorded at the Switzerland crib?"""
01:48:30;01:48:32;"And he was like, ""Oh, yeah."""
01:48:32;01:48:34;"I was like, ""You ever see Shania?"" He was like, ""No, not once."""
01:48:34;01:48:36;"She's fully in this other..."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"It's kind of like Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"did their thing."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"I always thought about that."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"These international superstars like"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"Phil Collins and Shania posted up"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"in weird,"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"beautiful but weird,"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"vibe-less Switzerland."
01:48:52;01:48:54;"Especially Shania."
01:48:54;01:48:56;"- Yeah, it's really weird. - As far as I understand,"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"she's a full-time resident of Switzerland."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"She also owns a massive"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"sheep ranch in New Zealand."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"- But she's a country star. It's so American."
01:49:04;01:49:06;"- Well, she's Canadian."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"- Oh, wow. You know what I'm saying."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"I also kind of wonder, does she have a home"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"in Canada? I recognize that this is none of my"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"business. So, obviously, Shania, if you're"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"listening, I'm not pressuring you to divulge"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"info about your residencies."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"It's just interesting to me. Just like when you meet"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"somebody from a place"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"that has nothing to do with their life anymore."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"I was picturing"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"this person, from what I understand, she had"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"a real hardscrabble upbringing."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Really lived country life"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"when she was growing up in Canada."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"And now she just lives in a"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"gas house in Switzerland."

01:52:40;01:52:42;"1965. Like, there's a lot of those combos."
01:52:42;01:52:44;"- Yeah. - Like, Stefan Zweig, the"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"famous writer who, uh,"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"kind of inspired, like,"

01:53:20;01:53:22;"I always used to tease my sister because"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I was born in New York, and she was born"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"in New Jersey. So even though we both grew up"

01:53:30;01:53:32;"edge. So, you know,"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"sometimes, like, when I'm in L.A. and I think I'm about to die,"

01:53:44;01:53:46;"- I feel like the born"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"- Like Mars. - I think, like, the born"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"- (laughs) - Mars."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"- Or, like..."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"- Atlantic Ocean, body never found. - Yeah, that's what I was thinking."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Like, that's, like, harsh. That's plane crash."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"- Oh, I've... God."

01:54:04;01:54:06;"like, the New York, New York birth"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"is, like, a strong biographical look."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"- Strong start. - So, the strong start"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"is, like, sometimes when I've, like, thought I was gonna"
01:54:12;01:54:14;"die in, like, a small town."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"And I was just kind of, like, you know, born"

01:54:22;01:54:24;"Amarillo, Texas. I'm like,"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"that's interesting. - That's strong."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"- That gets the mind working. - Have you had that happen, where you're, like,"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"in a small town, you're like, ""I might die here."""
01:54:30;01:54:32;"- Things get hairy on the road, man."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"No, the main times that I've ever, like,"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"like, really thought I was gonna die..."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"Well, you know, your mind can run wild."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"- Yeah, sure. - Sometimes, like, you're by yourself somewhere, and there's, like,"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"a shady person, you, like, get paranoid, like,"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"""Is this person following me?"" - Yeah. - Or, like, some..."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"you're in a place where somebody gets violent, like, you're in a bar,"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"there are, like, some nut walks, and, you know, like, this is..."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"these are traumatic times we live in, so, like,"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"unfortunately, these things come up a lot."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"The main times when, like, I wonder if I'm gonna die is, like,"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"on a plane. Like, classic."
01:54:56;01:54:58;"- Classic. - Yeah. Where were you born?"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"- Sharon, Connecticut."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"That's not a good look. - Yeah. - My parents"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"were living in upstate New York, but the closest hospital"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"was across state lines."
01:55:06;01:55:08;"- Sharon, Connecticut. - Yep."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"- I noticed that, on Wikipedia now, they increasingly"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"will put ""origin."""
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Like, if somebody's born somewhere, but they literally, like,"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"came up or identified with another place."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"- First of all, I don't have a Wikipedia page."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"- Yeah. Oh, really? - No, I don't."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- Oh, we gotta get on that. - But let's say, in the future,"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"I have a Wikipedia page. - Yeah."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"- The ""born in this location"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"and died in this location"" sort of dichotomy"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"is, like, real low on my priority list."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"- Yeah."
01:55:32;01:55:34;"So what's more important? What happens in between?"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"- I would say so. - Life's what happens"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"in between..."

01:55:48;01:55:50;"I think Jake's accomplished more than enough in his life"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"to have a Wikipedia page. - That'd be interesting"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"to see, 'cause I'm sure it'd be mostly wrong."

01:56:04;01:56:06;"is a big Jake fan. I've noticed that on Twitter."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"- Oh, about 5%? - People will, like,"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"dive-- I'm just making that number up, but people will, like,"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"deep dive and find me. - Well,"

01:56:22;01:56:24;"time for all of us, but, you know,"
