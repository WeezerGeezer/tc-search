00:00;00:03;"Today, on Time Crisis,"
00:03;00:06;"Ezra Spohn just died in a hotel room in Chicago,"
00:06;00:08;"so I'm doing the intro."
00:08;00:11;"Seinfeld takes to Twitter to take a poll of"
00:11;00:14;"the listenership on what bands we should discuss."
00:14;00:15;"We get into King,"
00:15;00:17;"Gizzard, and the Lizard Wizard."
00:17;00:18;"We get into Weezer."
00:18;00:20;"We get into Built to Spill."
00:20;00:23;"We get into Ween."
00:23;00:25;"We get into the Rolling Stones on"
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:17;01:20;"Time Crisis back again."
01:20;01:23;"Still in the middle of the summer."
01:23;01:27;"Amazingly, we haven't missed an episode."
01:27;01:31;"I don't know if we deserve a pat on the back for that."
01:31;01:34;">> I think you do because you're the one out on the road."
01:34;01:35;">> That's true."
01:35;01:36;">> You're making this work. You're doing this from"
01:36;01:38;"a hotel room in Chicago."
01:38;01:39;"You're about to hop on a bus."
01:39;01:41;">> I'm all over the place."
01:41;01:42;"When I'm not on tour with the band,"
01:42;01:44;"I'm on tour with the family."
01:44;01:45;"That's often how it goes."
01:45;01:47;">> You know where your bread is buttered."
01:47;01:50;">> That's right. It all comes back to TC."
01:50;01:54;"I should also point out that now being back on the road,"
01:54;01:58;"there's always a TC presence at the Vampire shows."
01:58;01:59;">> Love to hear it."
01:59;02:00;">> I told you guys at one show,"
02:00;02:05;"somebody like the entire show in Colorado was holding a sign,"
02:05;02:06;"like a pretty big sign that said,"
02:06;02:08;"""I'm missing Time Crisis for this."""
02:08;02:11;"Every time I'd look up, it'd just be like up."
02:11;02:15;"Then I see people with two people"
02:15;02:17;"riding the rail at a recent show."
02:17;02:20;"They're wearing some homemade Time Crisis."
02:20;02:22;"I think it was like Time Crisis bucket hats."
02:22;02:23;"They're matching."
02:23;02:24;">> It's always there."
02:24;02:26;">> It answers the age-old question."
02:26;02:29;"Is there anybody who's a fan of Time Crisis and Vampire Weekend?"
02:29;02:29;"There's a few."
02:29;02:31;">> Little bit of crossover."
02:31;02:32;">> There is some crossover."
02:32;02:36;"We famously have the TC heads who don't fuck with Vampire,"
02:36;02:39;"and then we have the Vampire heads who don't fuck with TC,"
02:39;02:41;"but then there's the people who have a little bit of both."
02:41;02:43;">> Speaking of our fans,"
02:43;02:44;"that's a good setup for this episode."
02:44;02:45;">> Yeah."
02:45;02:47;">> Because if we wondered if we had any fans,"
02:47;02:54;"Seinfeld did just ask a question to the TwitterX community."
02:54;02:57;"Have we lost Seinfeld? Is he gone?"
02:57;03:00;">> He did his part. He asked the question and now he's vanished."
03:00;03:02;">> Well, he asked,"
03:02;03:04;"""Who would our fans like us to talk about?"
03:04;03:07;"What bands? What music?"""
03:07;03:09;"We didn't know if we'd get any responses."
03:09;03:13;"So far within the last few minutes, what did they say?"
03:13;03:15;"We've gotten hundreds of responses."
03:15;03:16;">> A lot."
03:16;03:18;">> People want us to do some deep dives."
03:18;03:22;"So it sounds like from a quick perusal,"
03:22;03:25;"one of the bands that people are asking us to do a deep dive on,"
03:25;03:28;"is King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard,"
03:28;03:31;"which I think it's impossible to do a deep dive on."
03:31;03:34;"It's too deep. You need a whole show."
03:34;03:36;"I don't mean like an episode of a show,"
03:36;03:37;"I mean you need a whole show."
03:37;03:40;"That's what the show is about, to go deep on them."
03:40;03:42;"But it does raise the interesting question,"
03:42;03:44;"which is we always like to ask on this show."
03:44;03:47;"Jake, do you know what that is?"
03:47;03:50;">> I'm aware. I have not heard a note."
03:50;03:52;"So this is exciting. Seinfeld, are you back?"
03:52;03:53;">> Can you hear me?"
03:53;03:53;">> Yeah."
03:53;03:55;">> Yeah. Okay. All right."
03:55;03:58;"My mic is bugging out. What was the question?"
03:58;04:01;">> It was, ""Does Jake know who King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are?"""
04:01;04:02;">> I do."
04:02;04:03;">> He does. He does."
04:03;04:04;">> I have a vague sense."
04:04;04:09;"Are they part of the jam world or is it a little more like indie, more indie jam?"
04:09;04:11;">> Well, that's a great question because there's"
04:11;04:13;"definitely some crossover."
04:13;04:15;"They're not a jam band, I believe,"
04:15;04:17;"in the sense that they jam,"
04:17;04:21;"but they're definitely doing something incredibly unique."
04:21;04:24;"I was just at a fish show on one of our days off."
04:24;04:30;"Me and CT drove up to Alpine Valley in Wisconsin and went to the fish show."
04:30;04:31;">> Tight."
04:31;04:34;">> Of course, part of being at a fish show is"
04:34;04:37;"the checking out what T-shirts people are wearing,"
04:37;04:39;"checking out the heads."
04:39;04:47;"I did clock a young hippie dude wearing a bright yellow King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard shirt."
04:47;04:50;"It wasn't like, I could tell he was a real hybrid character."
04:50;04:52;"It's not like, because the fish shows,"
04:52;04:53;"there's so many people."
04:53;04:56;"Of course, you could just see a dude in a polo shirt."
04:56;04:57;"You could see an indie looking guy."
04:57;05:01;"But this guy was definitely a hippie type dude."
05:01;05:04;"His pants were very hippie-ish."
05:04;05:08;"They had a kind of wookish volume to them."
05:08;05:13;"He was wearing the Birkenstocks,"
05:13;05:15;"they're the covered Birkenstocks."
05:15;05:16;"You know what I mean?"
05:16;05:17;">> I don't."
05:17;05:19;">> The little slippers."
05:19;05:19;">> Okay."
05:19;05:20;">> Sure."
05:20;05:24;">> Because at this point, I think the classic Birkenstock sandal is so mainstream."
05:24;05:25;"Yeah, Matt's holding it up."
05:25;05:26;">> Okay. Got it."
05:26;05:27;">> You see that, Jake?"
05:27;05:28;">> Got it."
05:28;05:28;">> You know that one."
05:28;05:29;">> Classy looking."
05:29;05:33;">> Everybody wears the classic two-strap Birkenstock."
05:33;05:39;"But I think those ones on a 20-something dude still read extremely hippie-ish."
05:39;05:43;"So anyway, I'm just saying this guy was not like a little hipster dude who also likes fish."
05:43;05:47;"This guy definitely looked the part of a young fish fan,"
05:47;05:49;"but he was wearing a King Gizzard shirt."
05:49;05:52;"So there's definitely some crossover."
05:52;05:54;"I just want to, before we get into King Gizzard,"
05:54;05:57;"I just want to point out something that I just realized."
05:57;06:02;"At this point, I think I've been to four or five fish shows."
06:02;06:05;"So not a lot by a fish fan standards."
06:05;06:08;"One of them, I went to with you guys at the Hollywood Bowl."
06:08;06:09;">> Right."
06:09;06:14;">> In set one, I'm standing over the CT and they go into the song Divided Sky,"
06:14;06:15;"which you might remember, Jake,"
06:15;06:17;"when we were playing you some early fish."
06:17;06:18;"We played you this really long,"
06:18;06:21;"mostly instrumental one with these really pretty guitar lines."
06:21;06:25;"You were into it and you're picturing them in Burlington in the '80s,"
06:25;06:28;"just doing this long, highly composed song."
06:28;06:31;">> Yeah. It's on one of their early records, right?"
06:31;06:34;">> Yeah. So CT was like, ""Have you ever caught this live?"""
06:34;06:36;"When they started playing it and I realized, ""Yeah, I have."""
06:36;06:39;"Anyway, this might not be that interesting to people,"
06:39;06:43;"but I just realized I've seen three fish shows in the past two years,"
06:43;06:46;"and they played Divided Sky at every single show,"
06:46;06:48;"which is highly unusual."
06:48;06:50;"If I had to crunch the numbers on that,"
06:50;06:52;"it's a very low percentage chance."
06:52;06:54;"One of them was with you guys at the Hollywood Bowl."
06:54;06:59;"One of them was at the Garden in the Summer with Rashida and Dev Hines,"
06:59;07:00;"and then at Alpine Valley."
07:00;07:04;"Just statistically, it's very unusual that I've happened to"
07:04;07:09;"catch that song at every show that I've been to in the past two years."
07:09;07:11;"It's a real treat. I really enjoy that one."
07:11;07:13;"Particularly, it was very beautiful."
07:13;07:16;"When the sun just starting to set in"
07:16;07:19;"this beautiful setting in the countryside of Wisconsin."
08:57;08:59;"Is it possible they're doing this just for you?"
08:59;09:02;"No, I don't think they would have known."
09:02;09:05;"Well, I just have some divided sky."
09:05;09:06;"Blast, man."
09:06;09:07;"I might just be blessed."
09:07;09:10;"All right. Ezra, how familiar with this band are you?"
09:10;09:11;"King?"
09:11;09:13;"King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard."
09:13;09:13;"Hell of a name."
09:13;09:18;"Well, they're the type of band where I know what I don't know."
09:18;09:20;"There's for me-"
09:20;09:21;"There's known unknowns."
09:21;09:23;"There's a lot of known unknowns,"
09:23;09:27;"which is all to say that some people know very little about that band."
09:27;09:30;"I know the shape of that band,"
09:30;09:32;"but because they have so much material,"
09:32;09:35;"I can't claim to be super versed in it."
09:35;09:38;"But I've always been hearing about them for years."
09:38;09:40;"I feel like once a year,"
09:40;09:43;"I go listen to a bunch of King Gizzard songs."
09:43;09:45;"I'd love to see them live."
09:45;09:47;"I've always been fascinated by them."
09:47;09:50;"But by the standard of their fans,"
09:50;09:52;"I know nothing, but I know what I don't know."
09:52;09:55;"For instance, literally just a couple of weeks ago,"
09:55;09:56;"I saw they had some new music."
09:56;09:58;"If I ever see they have new music,"
09:58;09:59;"I always listen to it."
09:59;10:02;"I was watching the video for a single they dropped."
10:02;10:06;"Then I started thinking about King Gizzard again and reading about them."
10:06;10:12;"The thing that is so unbelievable about them is that they've released,"
10:12;10:16;"I believe at the time of recording, 26 albums."
10:16;10:19;"One year, I think they did five albums."
10:19;10:22;"You listen to the albums and they're always"
10:22;10:25;"sound pretty cool like they sound like"
10:25;10:29;"a band that might only release an album every three years made it."
10:29;10:31;"They tour all the time."
10:31;10:33;"I don't understand the energy."
10:33;10:36;"You look at their set lists and they're not a jam band."
10:36;10:37;"So it's not like, okay,"
10:37;10:39;"they play a song and they'd take it on a ride and"
10:39;10:42;"just take it into new territory for 40 minutes."
10:42;10:45;"The set lists are always different because they have"
10:45;10:47;"this massive catalog and they're switching it up."
10:47;10:51;"So just that alone is an unbelievable achievement"
10:51;10:54;"and very fascinating about that band."
10:54;10:55;"You got to respect it."
10:55;10:57;"That idea of just like,"
10:57;10:59;"let's just make so much music,"
10:59;11:02;"but always have a thematic element to what we're doing."
11:02;11:04;"Always give our all."
11:04;11:07;"They go hard. So that's the main thing I know about them."
11:07;11:10;"Then I've heard enough music that I feel like I have a sense"
11:10;11:13;"of what they sound like,"
11:13;11:18;"but their whole thing is that different albums will have a different theme or a different genre."
11:18;11:19;"So it can be all over the place."
11:19;11:22;"I mean, we could start just randomly"
11:22;11:23;"just because they just released some new music."
11:23;11:25;"We could throw on one of the new singles."
11:25;11:26;"Do it."
11:26;11:32;"Maybe throw on that one that's called like B-2471 or something."
11:32;11:33;"That was the last one that I heard."
11:33;11:37;"B-741."
11:37;11:52;"Is it sort of like oxygen or something?"
11:52;11:53;"Is that like a condom?"
11:53;11:55;"This song's called Hot Condom Contest."
11:55;11:56;"Yes."

13:12;13:14;"This song at least has kind of like a souped up kind of"
13:14;13:17;"Allman Brothers kind of groove."
13:17;13:18;"But the vocals are--"
13:18;13:19;"I'm trying to get a handle on the vocals."
13:19;13:20;"It's like a group."

18:29;18:32;"or maybe it's just the fidelity of, like, the lo-fi recording."
18:32;18:35;"I'm trying to get a handle on like the vocal sound, but"

20:25;20:28;"I mean, I think, yeah, it's hard to take it all in."
20:28;20:29;"We can move on."
20:29;20:32;"I mean, I feel like we should all go see a show."
20:32;20:34;"What do they play if they come through LA?"
20:34;20:35;"Well, they're big."
20:35;20:36;"I think they play the Hollywood Bowl."
20:36;20:37;"Oh, cool."
20:37;20:38;"No, really?"
20:38;20:39;"Awesome."
20:39;20:40;"Not like the Fonda?"
20:40;20:41;"No, they're-"
20:41;20:42;"Maybe 10 years ago, bro."
20:42;20:43;"Yeah, man."
20:43;20:44;"This is 2024, King is."
20:44;20:48;"I mean, I know they're like multiple nights at Red Rocks."
20:48;20:51;"Yeah, no, I think their last LA show was the Hollywood Bowl."
20:51;20:52;"All right, I was going to say, you know,"
20:52;20:54;"all I thought of was, I'm blanking on their name."
20:54;20:58;"Nick, who's the band that you went with your son to see at the Palladium?"
20:58;21:00;"The 100 Gags."
21:00;21:01;"Yeah, yeah."
21:01;21:06;"Just like hyperactive, up-tempo, short attention span economy."
21:06;21:08;"Let's collage this."
21:08;21:11;"That's where I mean, yeah, reminding me of like Ween, too."
21:11;21:14;"Like, 100 Gags, there seems like they're trying on outfits."
21:14;21:16;"Yeah, there's a sense of playfulness and humor."
21:16;21:17;"Yeah."
21:17;21:21;"But similar to Ween, it's like serious muso dudes who can shred."
21:21;21:22;"Yeah."
21:22;21:26;"Like music school types, but with a sense of playfulness and humor."
21:26;21:28;"I just got a good idea."
21:28;21:30;"How about this for a tour?"
21:30;21:31;"100 Giz."
21:31;21:32;"Oh."
21:32;21:35;"100 Gags and King Giz are co-headline."
21:35;21:39;"I'm going to do it under my new company, Ezra Koenig Productions."
21:39;21:41;"We'll put up the money."
21:41;21:43;"I think that's a strong tour."
21:43;21:44;"We're going to be doing some big rooms."
21:44;21:48;"We might even be doing some baseball stadiums in certain markets."
21:48;21:50;"I think that'll [expletive] explode."
21:50;21:52;"And I'm willing to put up some cash on it."
21:52;21:53;"I'm in."
21:53;21:54;"I love it."
21:54;21:56;"Who else is on that tour?"
21:56;21:57;"That's it."
21:57;21:58;"I mean, maybe we get--"
21:58;22:01;"Okay, it's just a co-headline tour, not a festival."
22:01;22:03;"It's like a Wu-Tang Rage Against the Machine thing."
22:03;22:04;"Yeah."
22:04;22:09;"Maybe we get an alternative comedian to open on the bill,"
22:09;22:13;"give them $500 a night and room and board just to warm the crowd up."
22:13;22:16;"But it's the 100 Giz tour or King Gax."
22:16;22:18;"Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, King Gax."
22:18;22:19;"Maybe King Gax."
22:19;22:21;"They're making both shirts."
22:21;22:22;"We're going to sell--"
22:22;22:24;"I mean, merch-wise, we're doing all the combos."
22:24;22:26;"[MUSIC - KING GAX, ""HELLO""]"
22:26;22:29;"Hey, Rob, say, baby, you think you're so [expletive] cool, huh?"
22:29;22:31;"You think you're so [expletive] tough?"
22:31;22:34;"You talk a lot of [expletive] big game for someone who's such a small truck."
22:34;22:36;"Oh, look at those arms."
22:36;22:37;"Your arms look so [expletive] cute."
22:37;22:38;"They look like little cigarettes."
22:38;22:39;"I bet I could smoke you."
22:39;22:40;"I could roast you."
22:40;22:41;"And then you'd love it."
22:41;22:42;"You'd text me, I love you."
22:42;22:44;"And then I'd [expletive] ghost you."
22:44;22:46;"[MUSIC - KING GAX, ""HELLO""]"
22:46;23:04;"[MUSIC - KING GAX, ""HELLO""]"
23:04;23:05;"Yeah, it sounds cool."
23:05;23:11;"It sounds like a little too frenetic and like wowie zowie for where I'm at in my life right now."
23:11;23:16;"I would love to say that I'm going to dive back in and do the homework on King Giz, but--"
23:16;23:17;"You don't see it happening."
23:17;23:19;"I don't know."
23:19;23:20;"I'm too mellow."
23:20;23:23;"I feel like Jake at a King Giz show is the way."
23:23;23:24;"Yeah."
23:24;23:25;"Do you think they have any ambient stuff?"
23:25;23:27;"Wait, is there a King Gizzard ballad?"
23:27;23:29;"I would love to hear a ballad."
23:29;23:31;"That's where I'm hoping like Ween--"
23:31;23:33;"Ween will have those gorgeous ballads."
23:33;23:34;"Yeah."
23:34;23:35;"They give the band kind of gravitas."
23:35;23:38;"I want to hear a King Giz--"
23:38;23:43;"God, I mean, King Gizzard fans probably listen to this being like, oh my god, there's 23."
23:43;23:45;"Is someone Googling King Gizzard ballad?"
23:45;23:47;"They're definitely not all frenetic."
23:47;23:50;"Yeah, but like is there like an ""it's going to be"" or anything?"
23:50;23:52;"Like is there just something--"
23:52;23:55;"The answer is I can see it with my third eye."
23:55;24:00;"The answer is yes, but I don't know which of the 26 albums it's on."
24:00;24:04;"I've definitely listened to stuff and I was like, oh, this is more mellow or--"
24:04;24:12;"We listened to two songs and we're like, this band is too crazy."
24:12;24:13;"No."
24:13;24:21;"But what's interesting is, do King Giz fans just sort of not appreciate someone at our stage?"
24:21;24:23;"Is it just too deep to--"
24:23;24:25;"Is the pool too deep to dive in?"
24:25;24:27;"No, man, it's up to you."
24:27;24:32;"Yeah, I don't know like the tone of the fan community, but it's interesting how they have this slight jam crossover"
24:32;24:39;"because having not seen a show, I can't say if the show has the feel of like going to see Phish,"
24:39;24:44;"but I think what they're doing with records is what jam bands do with their live shows."
24:44;24:46;"You know what I mean?"
24:46;24:49;"Like they're taking-- which I've never--"
24:49;24:55;"I mean, I guess there's other people who are like super prolific like Bedroom Pop, like R. Stevie Moore type people,"
24:55;24:58;"people who just like build and build in the catalog,"
24:58;25:03;"but in a weird way, they're taking a jam ethos-- I don't know if this is how they think of it,"
25:03;25:06;"but they're taking a jam ethos and applying it to recording."
25:06;25:12;"And maybe also kind of like putting it back on, bringing it to the live show as well."
25:12;25:16;"But they-- oh, there's also one-- this is a very interesting element of what they do."
25:16;25:19;"I might have this a little bit wrong, but I was talking with somebody."
25:19;25:22;"They're not signed to like a traditional record deal,"
25:22;25:28;"nor did they self-release in the familiar kind of independent artist way."
25:28;25:32;"What they do-- and maybe this is only for some stuff, maybe it's only for live albums."
25:32;25:37;"They'll like release the files and encourage like small labels,"
25:37;25:42;"you know, like a cassette label in Cincinnati to do limited batch runs."
25:42;25:43;"Bizarre."
25:43;25:46;"Like with their own-- and like I guess that like you're allowed to make your own art."
25:46;25:48;"I don't know if they set a limit, but they're like,"
25:48;25:53;"""Hey, if you have like a small-- if you want to print up like 300 vinyl of this"
25:53;25:56;"and distribute it and sell it yourself, go for it."""
25:56;25:58;"So that's kind of a jammy thing."
25:58;26:01;"But again, it's like taking the jam ethos into the studio"
26:01;26:05;"and like still creating recordings, but at a pace."
26:05;26:06;"That is--"
26:06;26:07;"You know what I mean?"
26:07;26:08;"Very bizarre. Wow."
26:08;26:12;"So they don't-- I mean, so obviously, yeah, there's like zero quality control"
26:12;26:16;"on the pressing the records."
26:16;26:19;"And that's why I guess they give you more time to do other recording"
26:19;26:25;"if you're not dealing with like all of the like annoying office keeping"
26:25;26:27;"of putting out vinyl."
26:27;26:28;"Right. One less thing to worry about."
26:28;26:30;"I mean, and it's certainly working."
26:30;26:32;"Like they're really a beloved band."
26:32;26:38;"I find it very inspiring, but I just-- these guys just must be so high energy."
26:38;26:40;"Plus, they're from Australia."
26:40;26:41;"Did you hear what I said?"
26:41;26:42;"They're from Australia."
26:42;26:45;"Yeah, I mean, there's that too."
26:45;26:48;"But they're from Australia."
26:48;26:52;"They did all that, but they're from Australia."
26:52;26:56;"No, but just meaning that they-- obviously, they record so much"
26:56;27:01;"and they tour so much, and to come toward the US or Europe or something,"
27:01;27:04;"when you live in Australia, everywhere you go outside the country,"
27:04;27:06;"long-ass flight, you know?"
27:06;27:07;"Yeah."
27:07;27:09;"There's times where I've just-- we've done a tour in Australia,"
27:09;27:11;"and I was like, I want to take two months off."
27:11;27:13;"All the flying and [bleep]"
27:13;27:14;"Brutal."
27:14;27:16;"Flying over there, feeling all turned around."
27:16;27:19;"I was like so burnt afterwards."
27:19;27:22;"So these must be incredibly high-energy people."
27:22;27:25;"I'm a very low-energy person, so I admire it."
27:25;27:26;"I don't relate."
27:26;27:28;"But it's unbelievable."
27:28;27:30;"Yeah, in the little bit of their music I heard, I was like,"
27:30;27:33;"these guys are spazzes."
27:33;27:35;"Their passion is not chilling."
27:35;27:36;"No."
27:36;27:37;"Respect."
27:37;27:41;"I just tweeted, is there a King Gizzard ballad?"
27:41;27:42;"You found a Gizzard ballad?"
27:42;27:44;"Well, no, I just tweeted to ask that."
27:44;27:47;"So if I get a response, we can circle back."
27:47;27:50;"A Gizzard ballad is known as a blizzard."
27:50;27:53;"[laughter]"
27:53;27:59;"There's-- all told, there are 17 and a half of them in the catalog."
27:59;28:02;"I do want to call out Jake, and it's no shame to you,"
28:02;28:06;"but it's a bit of a spoiler now,"
28:06;28:11;"because on the Time Crisis Twitter, you've got hundreds of options."
28:11;28:13;"And then if people are connecting the dots--"
28:13;28:14;"Oh, I don't care."
28:14;28:15;"Okay."
28:15;28:17;"Like what? Like, there's a--"
28:17;28:22;"Oh my God, they talked about King Gizzard on the next Time Crisis."
28:22;28:23;"Holy cow."
28:23;28:25;"Yeah, I guess you're right."
28:25;28:27;"Yeah, that's fair."
28:27;28:29;"I could go on and I could just be like,"
28:29;28:33;"hey, just so you know, Jake's tweet has nothing to do with"
28:33;28:38;"the thing that I tweeted about a few minutes ago."
28:38;28:40;"That wouldn't be suspicious at all."
28:40;28:41;"[laughter]"
28:41;28:45;"Okay, guys, according to ChatGPT,"
28:45;28:49;"King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have explored a wide range of musical genres,"
28:49;28:53;"and they do have songs that could be considered ballads."
28:53;28:57;"One notable example is ""Sense"" from their 2015 album"
28:57;28:59;"Paper Mâché Dream Balloon."
28:59;29:02;"This song is characterized by its mellow acoustic-driven sound"
29:02;29:07;"and introspective lyrics, which set apart from their more experimental heavy tracks."
29:07;29:08;"So let's listen to that."
29:08;29:11;"Paper Mâché Dream Balloon"
29:11;29:14;"Ladies and gentlemen, we found a blizzard."
29:24;29:29;"It's in vogue to be fair class"
29:29;29:34;"When it comes to the mother taking care of eggs"
29:34;29:38;"I know it's so conventional"
29:38;29:43;"But it don't make no sense at all"
29:43;29:48;"But in fact, it's a pattern"
29:48;29:53;"Everything I hear will always make me action"
29:53;29:57;"I know it's recognizable"
29:57;30:01;"But it don't make no sense at all"
30:01;30:08;"But it don't make no sense at all"
30:13;30:16;"Like numero group soul vibes."
30:16;30:17;"Yeah."
30:19;30:21;"So what do you think of your first blizzard, Jake?"
30:21;30:26;"People pay for their cool pay"
30:26;30:29;"But they can't get access for free"
30:29;30:31;"Still a little off tempo for my taste."
30:31;30:36;"Jake did get a response for a blizzard called Work This Time."
30:36;30:37;"Okay."
30:37;30:41;"Let's check out Work This Time by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard."
31:15;31:17;"Slow enough for you?"
31:20;31:22;"Those fills are a little too high for us."
31:22;31:24;"Yeah, it's a little too frenetic."
31:43;31:51;"One thing I can say about this band, having probably heard like 4% of their output,"
31:51;31:53;"it's always pretty tasteful."
31:55;32:00;"Like, I feel like the palette is always like a Jake type palette."
32:05;32:08;"Like kind of warm, warm analog sounds."
32:08;32:09;"Yeah."
32:38;32:44;"Matt pointed out that Jake has the exact opposite issue with King Gizzard than he does with Zach Bryan."
32:44;32:55;"He needs that up-tempo barn burner from my boy ZB that he needs KG to slow it down."
32:55;32:57;"Goldilocks scenario."
33:01;33:03;"I mean, that's a lane right there."
33:03;33:09;"Goldilocks is the band that takes a little bit Zach Bryan, a little bit King Gizz."
33:09;33:12;"Ooh, that's wide open folks."
33:12;33:14;"God, that's another $100,000 idea."
33:17;33:24;"We go find some dudes from Oklahoma and we create kind of like a new school southern rock band"
33:24;33:29;"that has like the palette of King Gizz and we force them to put out five albums a year."
33:29;33:34;"They're like all like Oklahoma dudes, so all the music has like, you know, Oklahoma type references."
33:34;33:36;"That would crush."
33:36;33:40;"Yeah, we're doing arenas by 26, I think."
34:04;34:12;"Yeah, I mean to me it's like great band, but are you at a phase in your life where you're ready to invest?"
34:12;34:17;"You know, I feel like 24-year-old Jake, big fan."
34:17;34:19;"That could be true."
34:19;34:21;"I can get behind this."
34:53;34:57;"Wait, Jake, were you into the Cindy Lee album?"
34:57;35:00;"Oh yeah, I like that record."
35:00;35:03;"I haven't like gone back to it the last two months or something, but..."
35:03;35:07;"Weren't you talking a lot about it?"
35:07;35:11;"I'm talking a lot about it, but I definitely listened to it a bunch on YouTube."
35:11;35:13;"You like, you listened to the whole album?"
35:13;35:14;"Yeah."
35:14;35:15;"For like two and a half hours?"
35:15;35:17;"I think, yeah, I think it's two hours."
35:17;35:19;"Yeah, I like that record a lot actually."
35:19;35:22;"There's some crossover, some King Giz, Cindy Lee crossover."
35:22;35:25;"They're like mining similar territory."
35:25;35:33;"Yeah, yeah, Cindy Lee is a little bit more like, I don't know, weird kind of David Lynch 50s thing."
35:33;35:41;"Well, if any TC heads who are also King Giz heads want to make us an intro playlist, go for it."
35:41;35:44;"Make sure there's some blizzards on there."
35:44;35:50;"Yeah, or you could do an oops, all blizzards playlist for Jake."
35:50;35:56;"Just remember, Jake is a 47 year old man, correct?"
35:56;35:57;"Yeah."
35:57;35:58;"This is a 47 year old man."
35:58;36:02;"I mean, he's heard enough uptempo sh*t in his life."
36:02;36:08;"I've heard enough, yeah, kind of frenetic post Zappa riff rock before, so..."
36:08;36:10;"All right, gang, here's the client."
36:10;36:12;"Here's his profile."
36:12;36:20;"He's a 47 year old man, painter, internet personality, based in Los Angeles."
36:20;36:27;"He finds Zach Brian a bit too mellow, but doesn't love the uptempo Giz stuff."
36:27;36:34;"What we're going to do is create a playlist that suits him and his life."
36:34;36:36;"I don't even know what this character is."
36:36;36:41;"This is like, it's an Australian reality show."
36:41;36:49;"It's like a renovations show, but it's just like..."
36:49;36:54;"Each episode is an hour, but it's just about making a playlist for a dude."
36:54;36:55;"I like that."
36:55;37:01;"It's like Queer Eye, except it's just Zoomers making playlists for Gen X dudes."
37:01;37:04;"Middle-aged Gen X guys."
37:04;37:06;"Oh my God."
37:06;37:13;"Now, growing up, Jake loved pavement and ween, so I think there's a way in."
37:13;37:16;"That was a shallow dive."
37:16;37:19;"Is there anybody that we could actually do a deep dive on?"
37:19;37:22;"I feel like we didn't do, like, that band Justice, but that's okay."
37:22;37:24;"We're trying out a different format."
37:24;37:27;"I threw some names out here on the list."
37:27;37:33;"Sufjan, Stevens, The Doors, Back, Ween."
37:33;37:35;"I think, who I feel like we've talked about on the show."
37:35;37:36;"Yes."
37:36;37:41;"Let's see, Smashing Pumpkins, Fountains of Wayne, Traveling Mulberries."
37:41;37:42;"Okay."
37:42;37:44;"It's a good band."
37:44;37:53;"I mean, if we actually want to do a deep dive, the only one that I think we could actually truly do a deep dive on is The Doors, which I'm not against."
37:53;37:54;"But are you ready?"
37:54;37:57;"Have The Doors come up on the show?"
37:57;37:58;"I feel like The Doors have come up."
37:58;38:00;"They've come up plenty over the years."
38:00;38:04;"I think Jim Morrison as an idea has come up more than The Doors music has really come up."
38:04;38:08;"You may have a collective deep dive if you did a super cut of all The Doors."
38:08;38:10;"Yeah, we've gone deep."
38:10;38:15;"I mean, I've been saying for years that I think The Doors should be cool again."
38:15;38:19;"Matt's saying we straight up did an episode that was a Doors deep dive."
38:19;38:20;"Really?"
38:20;38:22;"I called The Doors deep dive, so I don't know."
38:22;38:24;"You know what's funny?"
38:24;38:26;"I'm seeing a lot of Weezer on here."
38:26;38:27;"I'm curious about that."
38:27;38:30;"Jake, what's your relationship with Weezer?"
38:30;38:34;"I love the first two albums and all the B-sides."
38:34;38:36;"And then I tap out."
38:36;38:37;"Rivers got weird."
38:37;38:41;"But I mean, there's definitely some good songs after the first two."
38:41;38:43;"For sure."
38:43;38:48;"I mean, after the first two, what are your go-to Weezer songs?"
38:48;38:52;"To me, it's like ""Islands in the Sun"" or whatever."
38:52;38:54;"That's not top-shelf Weezer."
38:54;38:56;"It might be their most popular song."
38:56;38:57;"I think it is."
38:57;39:00;"I know, but just in terms of Jake's takes."
39:00;39:07;"Okay, there is a song, a middle period Weezer song, I liked called ""Dope Nose."""
39:07;39:08;"Could we throw that on?"
39:08;39:10;"I love ""Dope Nose."""
39:13;39:14;"Let's see how this holds up."
39:44;39:47;"Oh yeah, I love this chorus."
39:58;40:00;"Is it top-shelf Weezer? I don't know."
40:04;40:06;"This song has very strange lyrics."
40:21;40:22;"This part is tight."
40:26;40:30;"It's like a big, kind of feel-good '70s chorus."
40:30;40:35;"I think it's sort of like when they fully embrace his love of..."
40:35;40:38;"You know he always said KISS was his favorite band."
40:38;40:39;"Yeah."
40:39;40:42;"I just feel this is when he fully was like, ""Let's f*** it."
40:42;40:46;"Let's just make big, anthemic stuff or something."""
40:46;40:49;"Yeah, that's what they were doing in the beginning, though."
40:49;40:51;"I know, but it always had a weird low-fi..."
40:51;40:53;"It's always been there, but like..."
40:53;40:57;"Yeah, this is like he's leaning into the classic rock a bit here."
40:57;41:01;"Like this big solos, I just don't think that they had..."
41:01;41:06;"I think in the first two records you get the big, kind of anthemic stuff,"
41:06;41:11;"but there's like a core kind of vulnerability and sadness to that earlier stuff"
41:11;41:16;"that I think he excised because the failure of Pinkerton in his eyes as he saw it."
41:16;41:21;"I mean, I guess he saw it as a commercial failure and a critical one maybe."
41:21;41:24;"And I think it just like crushed him."
41:24;41:26;"And he's like, ""Well, I'm not going to show that part of myself again."""
41:26;41:27;"That's the story."
41:28;41:30;"And they're sticking to it."
41:30;41:33;"It tracks in their music, I think. I don't know."
41:33;41:36;"Did any of those first two albums..."
41:36;41:38;"I mean, maybe Pinkerton in its own weird way did,"
41:38;41:40;"but they didn't have that kind of solo we just..."
41:40;41:44;"like that weird solo that we just heard."
41:44;41:48;"No, they have solos, but that one was more classic rock."
41:48;41:52;"So this is getting more pastiche and fun on Dubness."
41:52;41:54;"Yeah, I don't like that."
41:54;41:58;"You want just the classic Weezer play the melody?"
41:58;42:01;"Yeah, just the more simple, more emotional stuff."
42:01;42:04;"I don't like when they're shredding."
42:04;42:06;"It's just corny."
42:06;42:08;"Somebody requested this song, I think at Red Rocks."
42:08;42:12;"Or they requested Weezer, and we tried to do a little bit of Say It Ain't So."
42:12;42:14;"And I've always been struck by..."
42:14;42:17;"Weezer's one of those bands that obviously,"
42:17;42:22;"in Rivers Cuomo's extraordinarily talented songwriter,"
42:22;42:27;"it just so happens that their first album is just f***ing perfect."
42:27;42:29;"You could say that about a lot of bands."
42:29;42:31;"There are probably a lot of people who think the first Vampire Weekend album"
42:31;42:35;"might be our best album, or it has a certain quality that is..."
42:35;42:37;"A purity, an innocence."
42:37;42:38;"A purity."
42:38;42:42;"Because for me, of course, I've listened to Pinkerton in my day."
42:42;42:45;"Pinkerton is an album I was just coming online enough,"
42:45;42:49;"because I was 12, that I remember listening to K-Rock,"
42:49;42:54;"the New York K-Rock, and hearing the single El Scorcho."
42:54;42:59;"I had no idea about the narrative that that album being not a bit of a failure."
42:59;43:01;"I just remember hearing El Scorcho on the radio and being like,"
43:01;43:04;"""This guy f***ing can write a song. Great song."""
43:04;43:06;"I love El Scorcho."
43:06;43:09;"And I remember I recorded it off the radio,"
43:09;43:11;"and I was just like, ""These guys can't mess."""
43:14;43:16;"El Scorcho!"
43:22;43:26;"Goddamn, you half-Japanese girls"
43:26;43:29;"Do it to me every time"
43:29;43:33;"All the redheads said to shred the cello"
43:33;43:36;"And I'm cello, baby"
43:36;43:39;"Two won't talk, won't look, won't think of me"
43:39;43:42;"I'm the epitome of public enemy"
43:42;43:45;"Why you wanna go and do me like that?"
43:45;43:48;"Come down on the street and dance with me"
43:48;43:54;"I'm alive like you, so please"
43:54;44:00;"Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting"
44:00;44:07;"Oh, I think I'd be good for you"
44:07;44:12;"And you'd be good for me"
44:15;44:20;"All respect to Pinkerton, and obviously its status grew and grew over the years,"
44:20;44:23;"but, like, come on, Blue Album is..."
44:23;44:25;"Oh, yeah. I go back to the Blue Record."
44:25;44:30;"And those B-sides, the Michael and Carly, the Suzanne, yeah."
44:30;44:33;"Well, we could do a deep dive maybe on a couple of Weezer songs."
44:33;44:38;"I mean, I would start with, to me, the perfect Weezer song is ""Say It Ain't So."""
44:38;44:40;"Is that fair to say?"
44:40;44:44;"It's got the emotion. I mean, that's number one for me."
44:44;44:47;"I could pick something else, but I'd be lying."
44:47;44:52;"Have I mentioned on the show that the ""Undone Sweater"" song"
44:52;44:54;"was my brother's bar mitzvah song?"
44:54;44:55;"Really?"
44:55;45:01;"Yeah, my mom found a clearance sale of hundreds of Maxi singles."
45:01;45:03;"Oh, yeah, and she gave them to all the kids."
45:03;45:05;"That was the gift to all the kids."
45:05;45:06;"Amazing."
45:16;45:17;"Wait, actually, pause it for a second."
45:17;45:20;"I've always wanted to kind of do a deep dive on these lyrics."
45:20;45:25;"Yeah, this is some of the more, like, pointed lyrics he's written, I feel like."
45:25;45:30;"It's such an interesting song, because, like, I also think that the mood of the song is so perfect."
45:30;45:33;"You know, like, there's a little bit-- they go into ska a little bit."
45:33;45:34;"Uh-huh."
45:34;45:39;"And there's, like, this kind of sweetness, where it's almost like some kind of SoCal,"
45:39;45:42;"like, let the good times roll, like, kickback."
45:42;45:46;"But then, obviously, it's about, like, kind of dysfunctional family stuff."
45:46;45:49;"And even, like, so those opening lines, ""Somebody's hiney,"""
45:49;45:54;"which I think growing up I always thought of, like, being the word for, like, butt,"
45:54;45:57;"which I always found very disturbing, ""hiney."""
45:57;45:59;"But he's talking about a Heineken."
45:59;46:00;"Oh, yeah."
46:00;46:03;"""Somebody's hiney is crowding my icebox."
46:03;46:06;"Somebody's cold one is giving me chills."
46:06;46:08;"Guess I'll just close my eyes."
46:08;46:12;"Oh, yeah, all right, feels good inside."""
46:12;46:18;"Very strong and evocative and weird way to open a song."
46:18;46:21;"It almost sounds like it's been taken from real life."
46:21;46:25;"Well, I was going to say, it feels like one of the few--"
46:25;46:28;"again, I'm really, really only familiar with the early work."
46:28;46:33;"It feels like one of the-- especially on the first record, one of the lyrics,"
46:33;46:35;"a few lyrics that feels really specific."
46:35;46:38;"I mean, I guess there's the ""in the garage,"" he's talking about his, like,"
46:38;46:40;"kiss posters and stuff."
46:40;46:45;"But a lot of the other songs are just kind of, like, very broad, romantic love"
46:45;46:47;"songs or heartbreak songs."
46:47;46:48;"They're very broad."
46:48;46:50;"""Thing Ain't So"" is, like, hyper-specific."
46:50;46:53;"I mean, obviously, we all know the song, so it's no spoiler."
46:53;46:55;"But, like, it's funny."
46:55;47:00;"I think of the song as clearly is about the narrator's dad."
47:00;47:02;"But actually, you don't really-- you don't get into that"
47:02;47:04;"until that amazing bridge."
47:04;47:07;"So still in the beginning, it's like, is he, like, a kid?"
47:07;47:11;"And he's just, like-- his, like, alcoholic dad is, like, having, like,"
47:11;47:13;"a barbecue with his friends?"
47:13;47:17;"And he's just, like, that visual of, like, a bunch of, like, adult men,"
47:17;47:19;"like, pounding brews in the backyard?"
47:19;47:20;"Heinekens?"
47:20;47:23;"Well, or is it about, like, a stepdad or something?"
47:23;47:24;"That's interesting."
47:24;47:26;"I also thought it was a stepdad or something."
47:26;47:27;"I don't know."
47:27;47:28;"I don't know why I thought that, but--"
47:28;47:29;"Keep going."
47:29;47:32;"Right, because the nice box is just a refrigerator."
47:32;47:34;"You just picture, like, a kid coming home, and, like, your mom's"
47:34;47:36;"new boyfriend is there, and you, like, open the fridge, like,"
47:36;47:39;"""Hey, Mom, is there any, like, peanut butter and jelly?"""
47:39;47:42;"And there's, like, a sixer of Heineken that you've never seen before."
47:42;47:43;"Whoa. What's this?"
47:43;47:44;"Guys."
47:44;47:45;"Yeah?"
47:45;47:47;"Do you want me-- spoiler alert, or should we deep dive before I--"
47:47;47:48;"No, no, tell us at the end."
47:48;47:49;"Tell us at the end."
47:49;47:50;"Great. All right."

51:52;51:53;"Right. Is it?"
51:53;51:56;"Because Stevens cleaned up and found Jesus."
51:56;51:59;"No, I think that's his biological father."

52:01;52:05;"Also, Russell with Jimmy is his younger brother James."
52:05;52:06;"It's his brother Jimmy. Okay."
52:06;52:09;"So this is my guess, and then I want to hear, Nick,"
52:09;52:12;"if there is a ""true"" story."
52:12;52:16;"Is it like maybe this kid is like 12 or 13,"
52:16;52:19;"like that age where you might have your first drink."
52:19;52:22;"I don't know about you guys, but being at some kid's house"
52:22;52:24;"and be like, ""Should we try to drink some vodka?"""
52:24;52:26;"And be like, ""Oh, s***."""
52:26;52:29;"And maybe his dad's been gone for a while,"
52:29;52:32;"and his stepdad just moved in,"
52:32;52:34;"and he's slamming brews in the house,"
52:34;52:36;"and the vibe is kind of off."
52:36;52:39;"And when he says, ""Your drug is a heartbreaker,"""
52:39;52:41;"maybe the stepdad's an alcoholic."
52:41;52:44;"So it's kind of like, ""I can't believe that my mom's dating"
52:44;52:47;"this, like, brutal dude. His drug is a heartbreaker."""
52:47;52:49;"Like, he turns into a different person,"
52:49;52:51;"alcohol being the drug."
52:51;52:54;"And maybe this kid's at this, like, kind of turning point"
52:54;52:56;"where he's about to, like, grow up,"
52:56;52:58;"and it makes him think about adulthood."
52:58;53:00;"And he starts drinking, he finds Stevens' bottle,"
53:00;53:03;"and then he starts, like, thinking about his dad,"
53:03;53:06;"and, like, he can't believe that this is how things have turned out."
53:06;53:09;"Like, this flood of emotions about his parents splitting up"
53:09;53:12;"comes out. Is this remotely close, Nick,"
53:12;53:14;"to what the internet says?"
53:14;53:16;"Yeah, I think you're-- I mean, I've listened to the song"
53:16;53:17;"thousands of times--"
53:17;53:18;"It's very straightforward."
53:18;53:19;"--and never got there."
53:19;53:21;"But it-- no, it's very straightforward."
53:21;53:24;"It just-- the story is interesting."
53:24;53:28;"Or the actual, like, sort of kernel of the actual inspiration."
53:28;53:31;"So it's about Cuomo's personal experience"
53:31;53:33;"and emotions. The song's lyrics were inspired"
53:33;53:35;"by a traumatic moment in Cuomo's childhood"
53:35;53:37;"when he mistakenly thought that his parents' divorce"
53:37;53:40;"was caused by his mother's relationship with another man."
53:40;53:43;"In the song, he references finding a beer in the refrigerator"
53:43;53:45;"and associating it with the painful memories of his father"
53:45;53:48;"leaving the family, leading to fears of his stepfather"
53:48;53:49;"might do the same."
53:49;53:52;"So I think that the beer in the icebox is like,"
53:52;53:54;"""Oh, is this someone else's beer?"""
53:54;53:55;"Like, yet another dude?"
53:55;53:57;"Yet another dude. So--"
53:57;53:58;"Someone tiny."
53:59;54:01;"The telltale Heineken."
54:01;54:04;"Yeah, so maybe this is like-- I mean, what this is saying"
54:04;54:07;"is that-- so his father left, thinking it was because of this,"
54:07;54:10;"you know, mom's extramarital affair or whatever."
54:10;54:13;"And that maybe that this is taking place with his stepdad,"
54:13;54:15;"thinking now his stepdad's gonna leave."
54:15;54:17;"And just the idea of, like, a beer in the icebox"
54:17;54:19;"being like, ""Oh, this is-- like, someone else's"
54:19;54:20;"over the house,"" or something."
54:20;54:23;"Right. Oh, but so he actually-- he likes his stepdad."
54:23;54:24;"This is a pro-stepdad song."
54:24;54:26;"Yeah, at that age, yes."
54:26;54:28;"I think it feels like it's pro-dad."
54:28;54:31;"Pro-- pro-male figure in your life."
54:31;54:33;"But your drug is a heartbreaker."
54:33;54:35;"But is that-- that is alcohol somehow?"
54:35;54:37;"My love is a lifetaker?"
54:37;54:38;"Yeah, yeah."
54:38;54:40;"Which maybe is the reason that his dad left."

01:11:14;01:11:17;"there's this kind of, I don't know, innocence or something"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"with this record."

01:11:59;01:12:00;"Yeah."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"So that means that's your favorite built-to-spell album?"
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Oh, yeah."

01:12:41;01:12:44;"It's kind of interesting hearing this next to the Weezer."
01:12:44;01:12:47;"Yeah, I can see it."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"In some ways, very similar."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"Yeah."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"It's just like looser and less beefy."

01:13:04;01:13:07;"And then if you got like even looser,"
01:13:07;01:13:11;"but the same guitar tone, you're in to Modest Mouse."
01:13:11;01:13:15;"I feel like there's some, I don't know, connective tissue."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"I feel like Modest Mouse is a little more juiced up."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"Yeah, but it's this weird same guitar tone to me."
01:13:21;01:13:24;"But Modest Mouse is like very different eras, right?"
01:13:24;01:13:24;"Yeah."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"Late '90s, early '20s."

01:13:51;01:13:52;"This is interesting."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"Matt texted me saying--"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"An Albertson stir fry?"
01:13:55;01:13:56;"Yeah."
01:13:56;01:13:57;"Is that what he said?"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"To Matt, this reminds him of Buddy Holly."
01:13:59;01:14:00;"I can see that."
01:14:00;01:14:07;"(SINGING) Won't you let me be bottled up in this time?"

01:15:56;01:16:04;"Bottled up in this time, it's all I can see."
01:16:04;01:16:08;"Should have been there last night and heard"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"what the big dipper said."
01:16:10;01:16:13;"There's a great song on here called ""Twin Falls, Idaho,"""
01:16:13;01:16:15;"which is a complete childhood song."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"I love that song."

01:16:17;01:16:17;"Yeah."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"That's a great one."

01:16:27;01:16:29;"or around two minutes, and that was on it."
01:16:29;01:16:32;"Because I think that song's almost exactly two minutes"
01:16:32;01:16:33;"or something."
01:16:33;01:16:41;"(SINGING) Christmas, Twin Falls, Idaho is her oldest memory."

01:18:39;01:18:43;"I mean, yeah, there was like ""Only in Dreams,"" which is more structured"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"than this, or like more kind of-- it's just tighter, maybe."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"But I wish Weezer did more of that."
01:18:49;01:18:52;"[MUSIC - ""TWIN FALLS, IDAHO""]"
01:18:53;01:18:56;"I mean, Doug's leaning into his like Neil Young love,"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"that in a way that Rivers--"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"I don't really hear a Neil Young influence on Rivers."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"No, there's never been that shagginess."

01:19:24;01:19:34;"I mean, listen to all this music."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I don't know if it's a selection bias thing."
01:19:37;01:19:40;"[MUSIC - ""TWIN FALLS, IDAHO""]"
01:19:40;01:19:45;"Yeah."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Selection bias thing."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"But think about like something about ""Twin Falls, Idaho,"" the blue album,"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"and then our long discussion about Nirvana a few months ago."
01:19:53;01:19:59;"I just feel like just so much of the music from this time period"
01:19:59;01:20:05;"is like-- has this like weird kind of like haunted nostalgia for childhood."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Yeah."
01:20:06;01:20:10;"I mean, like obviously, I tell you, the ""Azurette"" book like really made me"
01:20:10;01:20:15;"think deeply about like Kurt's life and the extent to which, you know,"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"those crazy quotes in the book are not crazy."
01:20:17;01:20:22;"It was like intense, intensely emotional quotes where he says stuff like,"
01:20:22;01:20:26;"""Yeah, I was happy until I was whatever,"" he says, ""eight."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"And then I was never happy again."""
01:20:28;01:20:31;"Music for children of divorce is really--"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Yeah."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"You're right, because I feel in the '70s or '80s,"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"like people are looking back at their childhood were like,"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"""My childhood sucked."""
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Like that was whack."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Yeah."
01:20:40;01:20:44;"They're referencing these small glimmers of like,"
01:20:44;01:20:47;"""I felt safe then,"" or--"
01:20:47;01:20:51;"I mean, even just the fact like multiple references to grandma."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Like there was a period of--"
01:20:53;01:20:55;"River sings about grandma."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"Kurt sings about grandma, like, ""Grandma, I want to go home."""
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Like do--"
01:21:03;01:21:06;"It's sort of when the dream ended, which I don't--"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"you know, that sort of childhood, whatever level of protection,"
01:21:09;01:21:15;"whatever the false reality or whatever, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"But I don't think you get that from music in the '80s."
01:21:18;01:21:23;"Yeah, and grandma could be a symbol of a lot of things in a turbulent childhood."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"It could be a symbol of stability."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"Like your parents are going through it."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"You go spend time at grandma's house, and it's kind of good vibes over there."
01:21:30;01:21:35;"Or in the Kurt version of like, ""Grandma, I want to go home,"""
01:21:35;01:21:37;"you're shoved off to grandma's house, and you're like,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"""Oh, my God, something went wrong here. Why am I not with my parents?"""
01:21:41;01:21:48;"But, yeah, I wonder if the early '90s there's more bands referencing grandma"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"than in other eras."
01:21:50;01:21:57;"And even just like the nostalgia factor of like talking about toys"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"and TV shows from the past."
01:21:59;01:22:02;"I guess there--of course there's nostalgia in every generation,"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"but there's like a pointed version of it where it's like,"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"""Remember when we were kids?"""
01:22:07;01:22:09;"And there's like this heaviness to it."
01:22:09;01:22:15;"Like when--I don't know, when River sings about like the Dungeons & Dragons"
01:22:15;01:22:19;"or--or Mary Tyler Moore."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"Like childhood was like a fantasy."
01:22:22;01:22:26;"I know. I'm thinking about how like a show like The Wonder Years"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"is about being a kid, and you're like, ""Remember when we were kids"
01:22:28;01:22:32;"and our brothers and sisters were in Vietnam?"""
01:22:32;01:22:34;"That wasn't like a really fun time."
01:22:34;01:22:39;"I don't know. There's this idea that it was maybe an illusion of fun or whatever."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"Like before the dream--like I'm saying before the dream broke, you know?"
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Mm-hmm."
01:22:44;01:22:47;"That you get, and then you're like, ""Oh, yeah, our parents got divorced."
01:22:47;01:22:50;"They never liked each other."" I don't know."
01:22:50;01:22:59;"It doesn't feel like the same level of nostalgia for the '50s and '60s even, you know?"
01:22:59;01:23:03;"Yeah, whereas, I mean, all this stuff is so reductive, like huge grain of salt."
01:23:03;01:23:08;"But even if I think about like what's a classic when people make fun of millennials"
01:23:08;01:23:15;"and like millennial culture, a classic thing they like to rib,"
01:23:15;01:23:20;"which is, you know, highly laughable, but it's all that like merch from like--"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"I don't know when it would be, like the early 2010s that would basically say like"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"""Adulting is hard."""
01:23:24;01:23:25;"Yeah."
01:23:25;01:23:29;"Because, you know, coffee mugs or sweatshirts or something where it's like,"
01:23:29;01:23:36;"""Ugh, adulting is hard,"" where it's almost like, again, very, very broad strokes"
01:23:36;01:23:41;"that if like the millennial version was like, ""Childhood was awesome,"
01:23:41;01:23:45;"and then I got to adulthood, and adulting was hard."
01:23:45;01:23:47;"What?"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"Can I just like still be a kid forever?"
01:23:49;01:23:51;"Because like, you know what?"
01:23:51;01:23:54;"I still like to watch Disney movies and like eat ice cream or whatever."""
01:23:54;01:23:59;"That's like an interesting contrast to the music of this time at least,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"which clearly was reflective of some percentage of people's experience,"
01:24:02;01:24:07;"which was something--yeah, this like childhood was already shattered,"
01:24:07;01:24:10;"and you're looking through the shards looking for those moments of peace,"
01:24:10;01:24:15;"and you're almost like haunted by it versus like, ""I was happy until adulthood."""
01:24:15;01:24:18;"Obviously, the current version is, ""I was happy until I was seven,"""
01:24:18;01:24:23;"versus, ""I was happy until I was, you know, 25,"
01:24:23;01:24:26;"and then I realized, hold up, I'm working in an office."""
01:24:26;01:24:31;"You know, just like two different ways of looking at like the phases of life."
01:24:31;01:24:34;"I wonder what the like real young generation,"
01:24:34;01:24:38;"like the art produced by like the kind of like COVID generation."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"I mean, I'm sure you guys have had these conversations a million times,"
01:24:41;01:24:45;"like Jake, me and you, our kids are little,"
01:24:45;01:24:49;"so they don't remember anything about COVID."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"I always think about like the kids for whom it like--"
01:24:52;01:24:56;"when you just think about the stuff that like is just so huge for you,"
01:24:56;01:25:01;"the TV shows, the experiences that happened to you from ages,"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"what do you think is like the true sweet spot,"
01:25:03;01:25:07;"like seven through like 13 or something, you know?"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"In terms of maximum impact?"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Yeah, in terms of--"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"When you say sweet spot, what do you mean?"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"The sweet spot, I think max is 12."
01:25:15;01:25:19;"Like you remember it so deeply, and you're not totally--"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"you're not like in the driver's seat yet."
01:25:21;01:25:24;"Like I think by the time you're 14 or 15,"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"those experiences are huge too,"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"but you're just like more in the driver's seat or something."
01:25:29;01:25:33;"Like seven through 12, I feel like when I was like 13,"
01:25:33;01:25:36;"and not just because I had a bar mitzvah"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"and became a man in the Jewish faith,"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"but I just feel like I was like online in a different way."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"And then, you know, obviously you don't remember much stuff"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"when you're really little."
01:25:45;01:25:50;"Like seven through 12 is like this first big like inhale"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"of like the world and those things like stay with you,"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"but you're still kind of forming."
01:25:55;01:25:57;"Whereas by the time you're like 13 or 14,"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"you're like, you're there."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"You're not totally grown up, but you're like there."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"I don't know. I know that's pretty vague."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"But like, again, I'm thinking about Kurt."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Obviously, I keep coming back to this,"
01:26:08;01:26:11;"that his parents didn't get divorced when he was two."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"They didn't get divorced when he was 16."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"They got divorced in that middle zone,"
01:26:16;01:26:20;"like a particularly interesting developmental phase of life."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"Because again, like I think for a lot of adults,"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"even if they were like lockdown was horrible,"
01:26:25;01:26:29;"COVID was horrible, it's still kind of like we were adults."
01:26:29;01:26:33;"And like, whether you liked elements of it or you hated it,"
01:26:33;01:26:36;"you got through it and it was, you know."
01:26:36;01:26:39;"But then I think about the kids in that zone."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"- Who were like seven, eight."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"- Yeah, I guess seven through like 13."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"I mean, obviously if you're in high school,"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"that's crazy too, or college."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"But I just wonder if that will, how it'll manifest."
01:26:49;01:26:52;"- Yeah, I mean, I can speak directly to that."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"So like with Max, who was eight, right?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Like eight to 10 is when it happened."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"And he's in this like very, like I think you're right."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"I think that that pocket is totally formative."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"And for Max, it was like a very good experience."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"Because you're right, you're not in the driver's seat."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"It's just formative."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"You don't look at it even necessarily as good or bad."
01:27:13;01:27:16;"It just sort of, it is developmentally helps you"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"become who you will be."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"And for Max, it was like he could do online school."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"There's kids who couldn't do it."
01:27:22;01:27:25;"But for the most part, you're not reflecting on it"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"even as like a necessarily good or bad experience."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"You're just like, this is my experience."
01:27:30;01:27:33;"And you know, that's just formative."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"- But maybe if he'd been 11 or 12,"
01:27:35;01:27:38;"it would have been a whole different story."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Disruptive."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"I guess we've been like disruptive."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"- Yeah, so basically what I'm asking is,"
01:27:42;01:27:44;"what type of lyrics and guitar tones"
01:27:44;01:27:49;"are we going to be hearing in about eight to 10 years?"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- The reason I was thinking about this is like,"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"when did Kurt's parents get divorced?"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Because if it's like eight to 10,"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"it's like, I think it just sort of becomes"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"what your life is a little bit."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"If it's later, you're just like, f**k."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"- Well, but Kurt was extremely sensitive."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"So his reaction and the way he describes it"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"was like searing pain."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"- It's like more of an adult."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"- Yeah, he was young."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"- Yeah, like more or like a 13, 14 year old."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- Yes, yeah, exactly."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"And I guess, of course, like, you know,"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"like we talked about with Nirvana,"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"two dudes in that band came from divorced families,"
01:28:21;01:28:24;"could not have more different kind of like demeanors,"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"Dave Grohl versus Kurt."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"But yeah, Kurt was on the young side,"
01:28:27;01:28:31;"but describes it as life altering, never happy again."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Yeah, the way that you might expect"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"from a slightly older kid."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"- Yeah."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"- And maybe he's clearly a very unique person"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"with a deep, deep sensitivity."

01:29:40;01:29:42;"And the more things change, the more they stay the same."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"But I could picture a kid who's 12 or 13 being like,"

01:33:19;01:33:21;"Have the kids discovered Wien?"

01:33:23;01:33:25;"Are you just seeing a lot of references?"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"- I think following JD Vance."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"- Oh, right."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"- But even before the JD Vance thing,"
01:33:30;01:33:34;"I just feel like I've heard more music from newer bands."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"I feel like, oh, maybe they're into Wien."
01:33:36;01:33:39;"I don't know, just Wien feels very relevant lately."

01:39:45;01:39:48;"was the JD Vance playlist that came out."
01:39:48;01:39:53;"Or someone, some music sleuths were digging around"

01:40:00;01:40:02;"I actually didn't really know that record that well."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"From 2007. It's kind of interesting"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"he just stopped making records in 2007."

01:42:30;01:42:33;"which is like a 9-minute absolute banger."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"It's like a huge jam on it."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"It's the second-to-last song on the record,"

01:46:00;01:46:05;"I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"So Ezra's phone died. We're limping along here, guys. Sorry."

01:46:21;01:46:26;"Yeah, so we're going to just go out on Side 2 of Tattoo You."
01:46:26;01:46:29;"Starts with Worried About You."
01:46:29;01:46:34;"My favorite Rolling Stones side. And actually I think on the thread, Ezra said the other day"

01:46:39;01:46:44;"what's playing on the record player? Side 2 of Tattoo You."
01:46:44;01:46:49;"So we're going to play Side 2 of Tattoo You by the Rolling Stones until Apple Music kicks us off."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"See you in a fortnight."
01:46:51;01:46:57;"Sometimes I wonder why"
