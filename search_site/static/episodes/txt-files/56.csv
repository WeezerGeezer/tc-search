00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, back once again. So much to discuss. We'll talk to Mordecai Rubenstein, aka Mr. Mort,"
00:09;00:15;"about Grateful Dead fashion. We'll talk to Jake about his Grateful Dead cover band's glorious"
00:15;00:26;"return. We'll also count down the top five songs of today and 1979. All this, plus much more,"
00:26;00:42;"more today on time crisis with Ezra that he passed me by,"
00:51;01:21;"Tom crisis."
01:21;01:26;"Back once again, sitting here with Jake, Los Angeles, California."
01:26;01:26;"What's up?"
01:26;01:29;"Mid-November, mid-November LA."
01:29;01:32;"Finally getting to cool it off a little bit called November rain."
01:32;01:34;"That's right."
01:34;01:38;"So, uh, I've seen you more recently than the past two weeks."
01:38;01:40;"Seen you a couple of times."
01:40;01:40;"Yeah."
01:40;01:42;"Once you came by the studio."
01:42;01:43;"Yeah."
01:43;01:49;"Can you go on record and say that a Vamp Weekend album is being made at least."
01:49;01:50;"It's sounding great."
01:50;01:51;"All right."
01:51;01:51;"Thank you."
01:51;01:54;"I don't know how much detail you want me to go into."
01:54;01:55;"No, I don't want you to go into any detail beyond that."
01:55;01:59;"I just want you to know that you, you came to the studio, you witnessed a group of"
01:59;02:00;"people hard at work."
02:00;02:01;"Oh yeah."
02:01;02:01;"Okay."
02:01;02:04;"And I brought by a very special guest."
02:04;02:04;"Right."
02:04;02:08;"Jake brought by the guitarist from his grateful dead cover band."
02:08;02:09;"Right."
02:09;02:12;"Came through, was putting down some tasty licks."
02:12;02:13;"Great having him in the room."
02:13;02:18;"But before you guys came to the studio, I saw you, you guys play."
02:18;02:18;"Yeah."
02:18;02:22;"I was really excited to see Jake's grateful dead cover band play because I hadn't seen"
02:22;02:24;"them in years."
02:24;02:28;"So I remember the first time I saw you, uh, might've been three years ago."
02:28;02:29;"I think you saw our first show."
02:29;02:30;"I might've seen your first show."
02:30;02:32;"Which I want to say was late 2014."
02:32;02:33;"Okay."
02:33;02:34;"So yeah, solid three years ago."
02:34;02:38;"And then since then from hanging out with you, I've become way more of a deadhead."
02:38;02:41;"I certainly like know way more of the catalog."
02:41;02:43;"So I was kind of very excited to see you guys again."
02:43;02:49;"Now there's a big thing happened with your grateful dead cover band."
02:49;02:52;"Well, first of all, I want to get your read on the show."
02:52;02:54;"Oh, well the show was great."
02:54;02:56;"I, to be fair, I only caught the first set."
02:56;02:57;"Right, right, right."
02:57;02:59;"Jake's band played two sets."
02:59;03:00;"I called the first set."
03:00;03:01;"It was very Europe 72 heavy."
03:01;03:02;"Yeah."
03:02;03:03;"Which I appreciated."
03:03;03:03;"Yeah."
03:03;03:04;"Second set."
03:04;03:04;"We took it out."
03:04;03:08;"That's when you guys started going to some early dead, just jamming."
03:08;03:13;"We did some dark star, you know, we just jam things out a little bit."
03:13;03:18;"And the funny thing is that even at this, it was at a bar called the old town pub in"
03:18;03:19;"Pasadena."
03:19;03:22;"I'm sure there are a lot of friends and family there, but also you just got like"
03:22;03:24;"some straight up deadheads who heard there's a dead cover band."
03:24;03:25;"Oh, absolutely."
03:25;03:29;"And then even in the little courtyard of this bar, there were people selling bootleg"
03:29;03:30;"dead merch."
03:30;03:31;"Oh yeah."
03:31;03:32;"Which was sick."
03:32;03:37;"The question everybody at home wants to know is what's up with the name change?"
03:37;03:43;"Because Jake's cover band, Grateful Dead cover band for years was called Dick pics."
03:43;03:43;"Yep."
03:43;03:48;"That's a classic cover band move is that your name is a pun on something related,"
03:48;03:51;"sometimes very tangentially to the band."
03:51;03:56;"You know, like you could make some kind of joke about something related to the band."
03:56;04:00;"A song title, a song title, like a record."
04:00;04:00;"Yeah."
04:00;04:00;"Yeah."
04:01;04:08;"And in this instance, Dick pics is a play on words because it's referencing a"
04:08;04:14;"compilation of dead, dead bootlegs at the Grateful Dead started releasing officially"
04:14;04:16;"in the nineties called Dick's pics."
04:16;04:17;"There was a guy named Dick Glottwala."
04:17;04:18;"Yeah."
04:18;04:24;"Who was one of the first tapers and the dead actively encouraged taping within their"
04:24;04:29;"fan base, which means someone shows up with a real to real unit and they maybe get a"
04:29;04:34;"little real estate on the side stage or they're in the very front of the show and"
04:34;04:37;"they're taping the show and then they're trading tapes."
04:37;04:37;"Right."
04:37;04:40;"This guy, Dick Glottwala was an early innovator in this."
04:40;04:46;"He taped like every show and then he would curate which he thought were the best shows."
04:46;04:51;"So it's a guy named Dick picking his favorite Grateful Dead bootlegs."
04:51;04:51;"Pics."
04:51;04:52;"Dicks pics."
04:52;04:57;"So you guys, when you started the band in 2014, your play on words, you took Dick's"
04:57;05:01;"pics, any Grateful Dead fan worth their salt and knows what Dick's pics are."
05:01;05:02;"Of course."
05:02;05:08;"And you named the band a very similar phrase, which in the rise of, you know,"
05:08;05:11;"smartphones and the internet also came into prominence."
05:11;05:12;"Dick pics."
05:12;05:12;"Dick pics."
05:12;05:14;"You called yourself Dick pics."
05:14;05:14;"Dick pics."
05:14;05:17;"And that's P I C S."
05:17;05:17;"Right."
05:17;05:18;"Like pictures."
05:18;05:18;"Yeah."
05:18;05:22;"So that might sound a little convoluted to people, but for a Grateful Dead fan, a lot"
05:22;05:25;"of people would hear that name and be like, nice."
05:25;05:27;"It's like a fun play on words for a Grateful Dead fan."
05:28;05:29;"I would say it blew minds."
05:29;05:31;"Some people loved it."
05:31;05:31;"Yeah."
05:31;05:35;"Some people were like, that is the most genius cover band name I've ever heard."
05:35;05:41;"Cause it's going from the 1960s bootleg guy who's curating this live show."
05:41;05:42;"Yeah."
05:42;05:48;"To full internet era, iPhone era, very lewd."
05:48;05:49;"Phenomenon."
05:49;05:50;"Exactly."
05:50;05:51;"Exactly."
05:51;05:53;"I'm told that we met at Willow."
05:53;05:55;"I didn't cry, but I cried."
05:55;05:59;"Don't pronounce how to cover up a clear blue sky."
05:59;06:03;"Tears are crying for that woman from the bloody big river."
06:03;06:05;"I'm a moose cry."
06:05;06:06;"She likes that."
06:06;06:11;"I met her accidentally in St."
06:11;06:12;"Mark, Minnesota."
06:12;06:16;"She told me how bad her time, her heart had drowned by a southern dove."
06:16;06:19;"And I heard her dream in my dance dream."
06:19;06:21;"She bought me a dollar a pop."
06:21;06:23;"And I'm following the big river where they call."
06:23;06:26;"Don't that we met at Willow."
06:26;06:28;"I didn't cry, but I cried."
06:28;06:33;"Don't pronounce how to cover up a clear blue sky."
06:33;06:37;"Tears are crying for that woman from the bloody big river."
06:37;06:39;"I'm a moose cry."
06:39;06:40;"She likes that."
06:40;06:46;"It's got all the hallmarks of a good cover band name."
06:46;06:46;"Yep."
06:46;06:48;"It appeals to the heads."
06:48;06:53;"It's a play on words, except not everybody likes dick pics."
06:53;06:53;"Yeah."
06:53;06:54;"Dick pics got a lot of heat."
06:54;06:56;"So dick pics got some heat."
06:56;07:00;"We got some heat from friends of ours who, you know, I absolutely"
07:00;07:01;"respect their point of view."
07:01;07:01;"Yeah."
07:01;07:06;"And people who aren't friends of ours that I don't even know who are like that"
07:06;07:11;"name is offensive and triggering and brutal."
07:11;07:14;"And I always understood the logic of that."
07:14;07:15;"Right."
07:15;07:19;"And it took me a long time to come around to the kind of visceral emotional"
07:19;07:20;"accepting."
07:20;07:20;"Yeah."
07:20;07:26;"And being like empathetic and accepting the like emotional truth of maybe what"
07:26;07:26;"they were saying."
07:26;07:31;"Who knew that talking about your Grateful Dead cover band would intersect so well"
07:31;07:32;"with what's going on in the news right now."
07:32;07:35;"As are the dead are timeless."
07:35;07:35;"The dead."
07:35;07:36;"I mean, they're always relevant."
07:36;07:42;"Not only the Grateful Dead back, but yeah, it's a very timely topic because you"
07:42;07:45;"have a lot of people, victims of abuse coming forward."
07:45;07:47;"You have the Louis CK, Harvey Weinstein."
07:47;07:51;"People are talking for the first time about not just the most violent types of"
07:51;07:54;"assault, but other types of sexual misdemeanor."
07:54;07:55;"Yeah."
07:55;07:57;"Unsolicited aggression."
07:57;08:01;"And so this had been a conversation going on in the band for a while."
08:01;08:04;"And also the band had not been active for the past year."
08:04;08:09;"We played some shows in November of 2016 and then took a year off."
08:09;08:12;"So you're coming back 2017 and you got a choice on your hands."
08:12;08:15;"And I'm about to post on my Instagram account about the show."
08:15;08:18;"And I'm like, I don't want to post about a dick pic show."
08:18;08:20;"The tide turned."
08:20;08:25;"Finally, it went from you intellectually respecting the point of view of your"
08:25;08:28;"critics to being like, you know what?"
08:28;08:29;"I don't feel good about this name."
08:29;08:29;"Yeah."
08:29;08:31;"I was going to be stressed out posting it."
08:31;08:32;"I didn't feel good about it."
08:32;08:34;"So we had all joked that we should, Oh no."
08:34;08:34;"Okay."
08:34;08:39;"Cause in 2015 we played a fundraiser at a elementary school."
08:40;08:44;"So we went by Richard, so we went by Richard pictures, right?"
08:44;08:45;"Dick pics."
08:45;08:46;"It seemed inappropriate."
08:46;08:47;"It became Richard pictures."
08:47;08:47;"Got it."
08:47;08:51;"Because yeah, that would be crazy to go to elementary school and be like, Hey,"
08:51;08:54;"we're Duke pics and all these parents being like, what is going on?"
08:54;09:00;"So when the show is coming up at the old town pub in Pasadena last Thursday,"
09:00;09:01;"we were like, you know what?"
09:01;09:03;"Richard pictures."
09:03;09:07;"So now on the band is called Richard pictures."
09:07;09:07;"Yep."
09:07;09:10;"Give it another four years and that will be."
09:11;09:11;"Inappropriate."
09:11;09:14;"But for right now we are Richard pictures."
09:14;09:16;"I mean, it's still rooted in the other name."
09:16;09:19;"So you're right."
09:19;09:22;"It's not, it's not a fully clean break, but I respect that you we've obscured it."
09:22;09:26;"You've obscured it, which I think, well, at the very least, and like, to be fair,"
09:26;09:31;"I think we both agree that like something that we probably don't realize being"
09:31;09:37;"heterosexual men is that getting an unsolicited dick pic could be like beyond"
09:37;09:40;"stressful and beyond unwanted."
09:40;09:44;"It could, you know, like you said, it could triggering could really even"
09:44;09:48;"traumatize somebody and also dead cover band."
09:48;09:49;"It's gotta be good vibes."
09:49;09:50;"It's gotta be kind."
09:50;09:53;"It's gotta be kind of like some brutal punk band."
09:53;09:56;"I don't think people use this argument too much anymore, but that's like some"
09:56;09:59;"old school, like hardcore Marilyn Manson."
09:59;10:05;"It's like, yeah, we called our band dick pics because we do want to offend."
10:05;10:09;"We want to explore trauma, male, aggressive sexuality."
10:09;10:10;"These are things that interest us."
10:10;10:16;"And while we may not be endorsing it, we do like to look at the dark side of life."
10:16;10:19;"I'm singing in the character, right?"
10:19;10:22;"I'm actually a complete sweetheart and I was bullied in high school."
10:22;10:23;"Yeah."
10:23;10:29;"And I deal with this by being a complete on my albums."
10:29;10:32;"I pay forward the trauma that I experienced."
10:32;10:42;"All stars now in the show, all stars now in the show."
10:42;10:47;"They love you when you're on other covers."
10:47;10:52;"When you're not and they love another."
10:52;10:57;"They love you when you're on other covers."
10:57;11:02;"When you're not and they love another."
11:02;11:04;"Beats one."
11:04;11:08;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
11:08;11:10;"Grateful Dead is about good vibes."
11:10;11:12;"It's about everybody feeling included."
11:12;11:19;"I mean, Grateful Dead concerts, I'm sure some horrible went down and really seemed to hurt them when they would hear about somebody getting hurt or something."
11:19;11:30;"But Grateful Dead concerts, that was one of the original safe spaces, you know, that was like people kind of turning their back on a repressive society with police violence, racism."
11:30;11:31;"That's the Grateful Dead."
11:31;11:32;"That was supposed to be a safe space."
11:32;11:37;"So I was looking at an article today from 1991."
11:37;11:38;"Yeah."
11:38;11:44;"In the New York Times that our producer Colin sent to me and the term safe space isn't used."
11:44;11:45;"Yeah."
11:45;11:48;"But that concept is introduced by Jerry."
11:48;11:49;"What did he say?"
11:49;11:52;"OK, so Jerry in this article from 91 is quoted."
11:53;11:57;"Someone once wrote that were a real cheap vacation to Bermuda, which is kind of right."
11:57;12:06;"But insofar as we're providing a safe context to be together with a lot of people who aren't afraid of each other, which is real valuable in New York, I guess we're important."
12:06;12:12;"He's basically like, listen, some people are going to come straight from Wall Street, wearing their suits and come to the show."
12:12;12:15;"And some people are going to be stoned."
12:15;12:17;"20 year old kids were in tie dye shirts."
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:19;"And they're all going to feel at home there."
12:19;12:20;"They're all going to feel together."
12:20;12:23;"And the way the world is now, you know, scary."
12:23;12:24;"Ninety one."
12:24;12:30;"I'm glad that we can offer that space where everyone feels included together."
12:30;12:32;"That's a great vibe."
12:32;12:33;"Jerry, want to have a safe space?"
12:33;12:38;"I mean, Jerry probably never had to get in some of the thornier questions that the world's wrestling with now."
12:38;12:40;"Nope."
12:40;12:41;"Back then."
12:41;12:42;"I guess it always seems screwed up, doesn't it?"
12:42;12:44;"The world is consistently screwed up."
12:44;12:48;"It just always seems like the most extreme version of history."
12:49;12:50;"Yeah."
12:50;12:51;"Ninety one even could have been worse in some ways."
12:51;12:53;"Of course."
12:53;12:54;"For a lot of people."
12:54;12:56;"Grateful Dead concerts are supposed to be a safe space."
12:56;12:57;"That's for sure."
12:57;13:04;"Me and my uncle went riding down South Colorado, West Texas bound."
13:04;13:08;"We stopped over in Santa Fe."
13:08;13:13;"That being the point, just about halfway."
13:13;13:17;"You know it was the hottest part of the day."
13:17;13:24;"I took them horses up to the stall."
13:25;13:29;"Went down to the bar room, ordered drinks for all."
13:29;13:33;"Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt."
13:33;13:38;"It being summer, I took off my shirt."
13:38;13:42;"Tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt."
13:42;13:49;"West Texas cowboys, they all around."
13:49;13:53;"Women, liquor and money, they loaded down."
13:54;13:58;"Soon after payday, you know it seems a shame."
13:58;14:02;"My uncle, he starts spending game."
14:02;14:07;"It's hollow jack and the winner takes a hand."
14:34;14:38;"My uncle starts winning, cowboys got sore."
14:38;14:43;"One of them called him, then two more."
14:43;14:47;"Accused him of cheating, oh no he couldn't be."
14:47;14:52;"I know my uncle, he's as honest as me."
14:52;14:56;"And I'm as honest as a demo boy could be."
14:56;15:03;"One of them cowboys, he starts to draw."
15:03;15:07;"I shot him down, Lord, he never saw."
15:07;15:12;"Shot me another, oh Danny Rupert, whoa."
15:12;15:17;"The confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold."
15:17;15:21;"We high-tailed it down to Mexico."
15:21;15:28;"I love those cowboys, I love their gold."
15:29;15:33;"Love my uncle, God rest his soul."
15:33;15:38;"Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know."
15:38;15:42;"Taught me so well, I grabbed all that gold."
15:42;15:47;"And I left his dead ass there on the side of the road."
15:47;15:51;"So, we're gonna do a little dead block, because..."
15:51;15:53;"This is gonna be a very dead intensive show, I think."
15:53;15:54;"This might be a dead intensive show."
15:54;15:55;"So strap in."
15:55;15:57;"I hope there's nobody who listens to Time Crisis,"
15:57;15:59;"when we start talking about the dead, is like,"
15:59;16:00;"there they go again."
16:00;16:02;"I feel like we provide context."
16:02;16:03;"I'm cool with that."
16:03;16:05;"I mean, you know, it's like, you know,"
16:05;16:07;"we talk about Home Depot, you know, dead, it's..."
16:07;16:10;"We try to find that kernel of general interest"
16:10;16:11;"within the specific."
16:11;16:13;"Corporate retail."
16:13;16:18;"So anyway, Jake, your email is the Time Crisis mailbag."
16:18;16:19;"It is."
16:19;16:21;"So you get so many great emails."
16:21;16:23;"Recently, you got one that was about the dead."
16:24;16:27;"This is Jake's personal and/or professional email."
16:27;16:29;"Yeah, I got a really long email."
16:29;16:30;"Great email."
16:30;16:31;"Can't read the whole thing,"
16:31;16:33;"because it was just a novella"
16:33;16:36;"sent to us by Samantha Ross."
16:36;16:39;"Very detailed letter about her history with the dead."
16:39;16:43;"Basically, like her parents were huge deadheads,"
16:43;16:44;"and she grew up in New York City."
16:44;16:48;"And Samantha mentioned that her dad had a..."
16:48;16:49;"Like, had this party trick,"
16:49;16:51;"where he could nail the exact year,"
16:52;16:54;"sometimes even to the city and the date"
16:54;16:55;"of any dead concert,"
16:55;16:58;"just by hearing the first two minutes of the show."
16:58;16:59;"So this guy was, like, very tapped."
16:59;17:00;"That's unreal."
17:00;17:03;"He was like, ""Tulsa, August '76."""
17:03;17:06;"He's hearing Jack Straw, a song they played 700 times,"
17:06;17:08;"and he still just, like, in two minutes, he knows."
17:08;17:11;"Which is weird that they'd have that much variation"
17:11;17:12;"in their performance."
17:12;17:15;"That's what people like about the dead."
17:15;17:17;"So she goes in to explain her evolution"
17:17;17:19;"from someone who didn't care for the dead,"
17:20;17:22;"mostly due to her parents' love of them,"
17:22;17:24;"into someone fully appreciating their musicality,"
17:24;17:27;"and how she's recently embraced them on her own terms"
17:27;17:29;"during a car ride this summer,"
17:29;17:31;"after she downloaded the American Beauty record."
17:31;17:34;"That's a classic story about heritage."
17:34;17:37;"Yeah, like your parents love it, so you kind of rebel."
17:37;17:38;"Right."
17:38;17:39;"And then you come around."
17:39;17:42;"Yeah, sometimes it takes life experience to realize"
17:42;17:45;"what the older generation saw in something."
17:45;17:47;"And I'm also interested in the fact,"
17:47;17:49;"it sounds like she grew up in New York City."
17:49;17:50;"Right."
17:50;17:53;"Famously on Live Dead, their first live album."
17:53;17:54;"'69."
17:54;17:56;"They're playing some of it at the Fillmore in New York,"
17:56;18:00;"and Jerry says, ""Man, coming to New York's always a trip, man."""
18:00;18:05;"Like, imagine Jerry just, like, in New York in '69."
18:05;18:08;"New York City must have been just so intense and weird."
18:08;18:10;"Obviously, there were hippies in New York."
18:10;18:12;"Yeah, it's like, who's hitting that Dead show in '69?"
18:12;18:14;"Is, like, Lou Reed going to that Dead show?"
18:14;18:17;"Or, like, the Velvets? Or, like, Andy Warhol?"
18:18;18:21;"No, I feel like at that point,"
18:21;18:23;"the Dead probably weren't, like, super cool."
18:23;18:26;"Andy Warhol's down at the Factory."
18:26;18:29;"Edie Sedgwick and Lou Reed and Nico."
18:29;18:32;"It's like, ""What's going on tonight, guys?"
18:32;18:35;"""The Grateful Dead are playing at the Fillmore."
18:35;18:36;"""You want to go?"""
18:36;18:37;"No."
18:37;18:38;"Of course not."
18:38;18:41;"I'm just trying to think of, like, some super, like, cool"
18:41;18:43;"New York artsy people."
18:43;18:45;"Like, were they catching the Dead?"
18:45;18:46;"Patti Smith."
18:46;18:48;"Patti Smith is probably still in high school."
18:48;18:50;"Was she going in to see the Dead?"
18:50;18:52;"My point is just that the Dead in New York City..."
18:52;18:54;"In '69, '70 is funny."
18:54;18:55;"...always been, like, a funny mix."
18:55;18:58;"'Cause New York City, as much as it is a..."
18:58;19:01;"produced a lot of, like, alternative culture,"
19:01;19:05;"it's also a hostile environment for hippiedom."
19:05;19:06;"For sure."
19:06;19:07;"Of course you get some left-wing people,"
19:07;19:10;"but you get a very specific New York version of hippiedom."
19:10;19:15;"To truly be that blissed-out hippie is difficult in New York."
19:15;19:20;"New York is cutting and ironic and judgmental and brutal."
19:20;19:21;"Yeah."
19:21;19:23;"Which is not the Dead vibe."
19:23;19:24;"And, you know, we've all seen it."
19:24;19:28;"You see some, like, random couple white hippies"
19:28;19:31;"wearing peasant-skirt tie-dye, just, like, stoned"
19:31;19:33;"in, like, a bodega at 2 a.m."
19:33;19:34;"You're just like, ""What? Do you live here?"
19:34;19:35;"You live in, like, Park Slope?"""
19:35;19:36;"Yeah."

22:14;22:17;"as it was extremely in to do so."""
22:17;22:18;"- Oh, interesting. - Now, I think Samantha's"
22:18;22:20;"a little younger. - Now I'm very curious"
22:20;22:21;"about what era this was."
22:21;22:22;"- I don't have her whole email printed here,"
22:22;22:26;"but I believe she's, like, mid-20s, if I recall."
22:26;22:28;"- I guess it also depends on what school she was going to."
22:28;22:29;"New York's a big city."
22:29;22:32;"- But it's funny to think about that being in,"
22:32;22:34;"'cause in my high school, it certainly was not in."
22:34;22:36;"""It was at this point that some of my thoughts"
22:36;22:38;"on the dead started to change."
22:38;22:40;"I did not like the fact that kids who had no knowledge"
22:40;22:42;"about anything dead-related wore their merchandise"
22:42;22:45;"so regularly, so it just had become a fashion statement"
22:45;22:46;"at that point."" - Right."
22:46;22:49;"- Oh, okay, Samantha Ross is 19."
22:49;22:51;"So she just finished high school."
22:51;22:52;"- She was in high school a few years ago."
22:52;22:54;"- Very recently. - Okay, right, got it."
22:54;22:55;"- Like, last year."
22:55;22:57;"""Even though I wasn't in to their music,"

23:06;23:09;"On the topic of banned T-shirts, I was a counselor"
23:09;23:10;"at a sleepaway camp this summer,"
23:10;23:14;"and even my 11-year-old campers had Blondie, Rolling Stones,"
23:14;23:16;"and, of course, Grateful Dead T-shirts."

23:24;23:25;"- It's interesting with the 11-year-olds"

23:28;23:29;"Maybe with the internet, it's different."
23:29;23:32;"I feel like maybe I was, like, 13 when I really started"
23:32;23:34;"taking control over, like, what I wanted to wear."
23:34;23:36;"But I had a friend who once said something,"

23:40;23:42;"whose parents want them to be cool."""
23:42;23:43;"- Dark."

23:46;23:49;"even with the kind of baby-boomer parents"
23:49;23:51;"who generally wanted to have positive relationships"
23:51;23:53;"with their kids, as opposed to, like,"

23:54;23:56;"""World's hard. You're on your own, son."""
23:56;23:57;"- Non-existent relationship."
23:57;23:58;"- Yeah. - Yeah."

24:01;24:03;"you don't want them to be bullied or something,"
24:03;24:05;"but I'm sure it's gonna be like that."
24:05;24:07;"Like, we're the generation who's gonna probably"
24:07;24:10;"be a little more tuned in and be like,"
24:10;24:12;"you know, you want your kid to probably, like,"
24:12;24:13;"have a cool shirt."
24:13;24:16;"- Or maybe in this, like, late, late capitalist era,"
24:16;24:20;"we intuit that being cool is a way to make money."
24:20;24:23;"It's definitely a way to-- increases your odds"
24:23;24:24;"of making a living."
24:24;24:25;"- You know what's also weird?"
24:25;24:27;"Imagine all these 11-year-olds whose parents got them"
24:27;24:29;"Blondie and Rolling Stones and Grateful Dead shirts."
24:29;24:31;"Do you think some of the parents are also sitting down"
24:31;24:32;"with them before they go to camp,"

29:35;29:37;"And then they're going to go to school one day, and these kids are wearing it,"
29:37;29:40;"and be like, ""Wait, do you listen to Guided by Voices?"""
29:40;29:42;"No."
29:42;29:45;"""I got this shirt for 750 Trump bucks."""

31:19;31:23;"# But I've been lucky, you're the only one"
31:23;31:27;"# Sun is calling, you'll be number one"
31:27;31:31;"# It's such a strange, strange old view"
31:31;31:35;"# Ooh, you think you're Jesus Christ"
31:35;31:39;"# You walk the water but you brush your life"
31:39;31:43;"# All you walk is the fire line"
31:43;31:49;"# It's such a strange, strange old life #"
31:49;31:54;"#"
32:04;32:06;"#"
32:06;32:10;"All right, so, Jake, I think Samantha's email"
32:10;32:13;"has really tapped into a rich vein."
32:13;32:16;"Grateful Dead, Grateful Dead t-shirts,"
32:16;32:18;"iconography, poserdom."
32:18;32:20;"Now, I don't think you've ever been on the same show"
32:20;32:22;"as Mordecai Rubenstein, a.k.a. Mr. Mort."
32:22;32:23;"Don't know him."
32:23;32:25;"Okay, so we're gonna talk to him on the phone"
32:25;32:27;"'cause Mr. Mort is a friend of the show."
32:27;32:29;"He's been on Time Crisis before."
32:29;32:32;"He's had all sorts of jobs in fashion."
32:32;32:34;"He's designed clothes."
32:34;32:36;"He's written about clothes."
32:36;32:39;"He's done a lot of streetwear photography."
32:39;32:41;"He's documented a lot of New York City street style."
32:41;32:42;"Yeah."
32:42;32:44;"He's worked at Marc Jacobs, Levi's, all over the place."
32:44;32:47;"So GQ sent him this past week to check out"
32:47;32:50;"some of the Dead & Company shows at Madison Square Garden."
32:50;32:51;"GQ sent him?"
32:51;32:53;"GQ, Gentlemen's Quarterly,"
32:53;32:55;"which is primarily a fashion publication."
32:55;32:56;"Gotcha."
32:56;32:58;"Actually, GQ Style."
32:58;33:01;"George Clooney's been on, like, half of their covers."
33:01;33:02;"Exactly."
33:02;33:03;"The last ten years, right?"
33:03;33:04;"Yeah, so this is what they said."
33:04;33:07;"""The Grateful Dead subculture is one of the most unique styles"
33:07;33:08;"""in music fandom, and on Sunday,"
33:08;33:11;"""Deadheads from all corners of the country proved it"
33:11;33:12;"""at Madison Square Garden,"
33:12;33:14;"""where Dead & Company kicked off their fall tour."
33:14;33:16;"""Dead & Co., led by John Mayer and Grateful Dead guitarist"
33:16;33:18;"""Bob Weir, attracts OG Deadheads"
33:18;33:20;"""who have attended countless shows since the 1970s."
33:20;33:22;"""For them, Sunday night was a reunion of sorts,"
33:22;33:24;"""and they pulled out gear from their collections"
33:24;33:26;"""of bootleg T-shirts and custom jackets."
33:26;33:29;"""But Dead & Co. also turns out a new generation of fans"
33:29;33:30;"""who have been initiated into the culture."
33:30;33:32;"""These kids have embraced a different side"
33:32;33:33;"""of the Deadhead DIY world"
33:33;33:36;"""and rocked up in their rare T-shirts"
33:36;33:38;"""from the likes of W.O.B.F. and From the Lot."""
33:38;33:40;"So these are the kids who are buying these new"
33:40;33:44;"Grateful Dead shirts that different people are making DIY,"
33:44;33:46;"like the people who are selling them at your show."
33:46;33:48;"What are they running, like, 70 a shirt?"
33:48;33:50;"It could be all over the place."
33:50;33:52;"""So naturally, they sent Mordecai Rubinstein,"
33:52;33:55;"""aka Mr. Mort, expert chronicler of subcultural style,"
33:55;33:57;"""to hang out and snap the most epic tie-dye T-shirts"
33:57;33:59;"""and steely patches that he could find"
33:59;34:00;"""throughout the day and night."""
34:00;34:02;"So we gotta talk to Morde, this is perfect for us."
34:02;34:06;"Friend of the show, was over at the Dead concert,"
34:06;34:07;"taking pictures."
34:07;34:11;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
34:11;34:14;"(phone ringing)"
34:14;34:15;"- Hello?"
34:15;34:17;"- Morde, how you doing, it's Ezra."
34:17;34:19;"- Oh, wonderful, thank you, how are you?"
34:19;34:21;"- It's great to hear your voice, you're on with me and Jake."
34:21;34:23;"I don't think you ever met my West Coast co-host,"
34:23;34:24;"Jake Longstreth."
34:24;34:25;"- Hey, Morde."
34:25;34:26;"- I don't believe so, howdy."
34:26;34:28;"- So first of all, you're a friend of the show,"
34:28;34:29;"so it's great to hear your voice,"
34:29;34:31;"even though you couldn't be in person."
34:31;34:33;"Also wanna congratulate you, I know not too long ago"
34:33;34:35;"you became a father."
34:35;34:36;"- Oh yeah, seven weeks."
34:36;34:38;"- Has that affected your style at all?"
34:38;34:42;"- Well, I went from mocking dad style"
34:42;34:45;"to, I guess, being dad style."
34:45;34:49;"- Well now, nobody can accuse you of appropriating dad style."
34:49;34:52;"- Yeah, but it's really like cramping my style"
34:52;34:54;"on this phone right now, I'm trying to whisper"
34:54;34:56;"when the baby's sleeping."
34:56;34:57;"- Oh, 'cause you got a baby sleeping in your apartment?"
34:57;34:59;"Okay, understood."
34:59;35:01;"Well, the main thing we wanted to talk to you about"
35:01;35:06;"is you were photographing the Grateful Dead lot scene"
35:06;35:08;"at Madison Square Garden this past week."
35:08;35:10;"- Oh yeah, definitely."
35:10;35:11;"- So how was it?"
35:11;35:12;"- It was amazing."
35:12;35:15;"I've never been to a show with Jerry or without Jerry"
35:15;35:19;"or what's their new playboy leading the place, John Mayer."
35:19;35:20;"I've never been to a Dead & Co.,"
35:20;35:23;"never been to a tribute band, none of that."
35:23;35:26;"So it was a pretty, pretty amazing far out experience."
35:26;35:31;"But if you have been, or you've done some research like I have,"
35:31;35:33;"there's no shakedown street here."
35:33;35:35;"There's no lot styles, there's no lot."
35:35;35:38;"Madison Square Garden's, you know, I don't think"
35:38;35:41;"if you opened up a pillowcase and tried selling socks"
35:41;35:43;"it'd last five minutes out there."
35:43;35:47;"So you had to really like, you know, dig for it."
35:47;35:49;"You had to like really look for the sellers."
35:49;35:52;"When I say dig and look, I mean, you know,"
35:52;35:55;"Instagram, creep, you know, which was pretty cool"
35:55;35:57;"'cause it made it like a lot harder to get."
35:57;35:59;"You know, people would see me wearing a T-shirt"
35:59;36:01;"the second night and be like, ""Where'd you get that?"""
36:01;36:03;"No, I bought it at the Steps at Penn Station."
36:03;36:07;"- So you found a lot of people, even in New York City,"
36:07;36:09;"like you said, Madison Square Garden doesn't have"
36:09;36:11;"some giant parking lot like when you're going to"
36:11;36:12;"catch a show somewhere else."
36:12;36:14;"So you found people just kind of like very quietly"
36:14;36:16;"selling their own bootleg Dead merch"
36:16;36:18;"all over the general vicinity?"
36:18;36:21;"- From Brooklyn to the subway station"
36:21;36:24;"to the exit at Penn Station to the bathroom stall"
36:24;36:27;"inside Madison Square Garden, I acquired it all."
36:27;36:29;"- People were just selling bootleg merch in the bathroom?"
36:29;36:31;"- Uh-huh, 100%."
36:31;36:32;"- And what did you buy?"
36:32;36:34;"- I'll tell you a couple things."
36:34;36:39;"I bought an amazing T-shirt with Lucy and Linus, Snoopy,"
36:39;36:42;"maybe that's the same person, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck,"
36:42;36:44;"some other little Bam Bam."
36:44;36:47;"I bought this beautiful tie-dye shirt made in Brooklyn."
36:47;36:48;"I like that."
36:48;36:51;"And I did a play on the word ""Terrapin"" at Penn Station"
36:51;36:53;"with two N's, which I thought was cool."
36:53;36:54;"- Strong. - Huh?"
36:54;36:55;"- Witty."
36:55;36:57;"- Yeah, I got myself the pink and green,"
36:57;37:00;"I got my wife the blue and black and white,"
37:00;37:01;"knowing that she'd want mine,"
37:01;37:04;"but I was nice where I actually got two."
37:04;37:06;"Normally I'm cheap and I just get one and say,"
37:06;37:07;"""Well, share it with you."""
37:07;37:09;"I got a couple T-shirts, I gave away Yamaka,"
37:09;37:11;"I got a pin, I got a couple stickers."
37:11;37:12;"- It was a Grateful Dead Yamaka?"
37:12;37:13;"- Oh, yeah."
37:13;37:16;"- What, it just had like a skull on it or something?"
37:16;37:18;"- It had a ""Steal Your Face,"""
37:18;37:20;"I think that's the classic kind of thing"
37:20;37:21;"with the thing going through it."
37:21;37:22;"- Yeah, the logo."
37:22;37:25;"- Yeah, it's funny 'cause I couldn't tell you one song,"
37:25;37:27;"but I can tell you almost every graphic."
37:27;37:28;"- Well, so I also wanna ask that too."
37:28;37:29;"- Okay, let's get into it."
37:29;37:30;"- Yeah, let's get into it."
37:30;37:31;"So, Morris, we--"
37:31;37:32;"- I'm gonna cut you off."
37:32;37:34;"I went to San Francisco a couple years ago"
37:34;37:36;"for what I thought was gonna be a couple days."
37:36;37:38;"Next thing you know, they're moving me there,"
37:38;37:39;"the corporate life, corporate housing,"
37:39;37:41;"everything's fun and nice, and my wife,"
37:41;37:43;"my girlfriend at the time was like,"
37:43;37:44;"""Where are you going?"""
37:44;37:45;"I'm like, ""Man, I need to go take this trip"
37:45;37:46;"""for a little while."""
37:46;37:48;"You know, they're gonna build an office for me"
37:48;37:49;"back in New York."
37:49;37:51;"I stayed two years in San Francisco."
37:51;37:53;"One of my first days, I went to Haight-Ashbury."
37:53;37:55;"I knew I wasn't getting no original"
37:55;37:56;"""Brain Tilled Dead"" T-shirt,"
37:56;37:58;"but I wanted what they want the tourists to have"
37:58;37:59;"because that's all that's available"
37:59;38:02;"for under $300, $400 back then."
38:02;38:03;"- Do you get that gap there?"
38:03;38:05;"- Was that where it was originally a gap?"
38:05;38:07;"- No, there's a gap at Haight-Ashbury now."
38:07;38:08;"- Is it the first one?"
38:08;38:09;"- No. - Oh."
38:09;38:12;"- It's just deeply, like, jean store."
38:12;38:13;"- Right, Haight-Ashbury is--"
38:13;38:14;"- I mean, you know."
38:14;38:15;"- It's not really true hippie anymore."
38:15;38:16;"- Yeah, right."
38:16;38:18;"The smell of weed is really just an incense stick,"
38:18;38:20;"but I bought some tees and I came back to New York"
38:20;38:23;"and my wife tells me, ""Take those off."""
38:23;38:24;"I'm like, ""What do you mean?"
38:24;38:26;"These are my 'Grateful Dead' tees."""
38:26;38:29;"She said, ""Get a haircut and take that fake [bleep] off."""
38:29;38:31;"I took it off, but I didn't throw it away."
38:31;38:33;"Not the haircut, the T-shirts."
38:33;38:34;"And a few years later, I really--"
38:34;38:35;"- Whoa, wait. Let's slow down."
38:35;38:37;"Slow down, slow down, slow down."
38:37;38:39;"You went to San Francisco for work."
38:39;38:40;"- Mm-hmm. - You're not a fan"
38:40;38:42;"of the ""Grateful Dead,"" but you love menswear."
38:42;38:45;"- No. - You can't name one song."
38:45;38:46;"You can't name one song."
38:46;38:48;"- ""Riding the Train."""
38:48;38:50;"- Okay, close enough."
38:50;38:52;"And this is before ""Grateful Dead"" shirts"
38:52;38:53;"came back into fashion."
38:53;38:55;"- Oh, yeah, this is when John Mayer"
38:55;38:56;"was probably doing that other song."
38:56;38:58;"- So you go to Haight-Ashbury, and you just--"
38:58;39:01;"you always like to get whatever the local tourist gear is,"
39:01;39:02;"so you buy these ""Dead"" shirts."
39:02;39:04;"You come back to New York, and your wife says,"
39:04;39:05;"""Throw it out."" Why?"
39:05;39:07;"Because she-- - Because she has one"
39:07;39:09;"from when she was 14, when she thought"
39:09;39:10;"she was a real hippie."
39:10;39:12;"- Ah, so she's a real deadhead."
39:12;39:13;"So she thought you were a poser."
39:13;39:16;"- Yes, and I was, and I really was."
39:16;39:17;"I wore the Patagonia."
39:17;39:19;"I wore the tie-dye. I grew my hair, grew the beard,"
39:19;39:21;"because all the menswear people"
39:21;39:24;"were starting to wear fedoras and bow ties,"
39:24;39:25;"and that's where I was coming from,"
39:25;39:26;"and I'm like, ""F--- that."""
39:26;39:29;"- Okay, so we're talking, like, ten years ago."
39:29;39:30;"- Yeah, bow ties?"
39:30;39:31;"- Yeah, that's what was happening."
39:31;39:33;"- Is that like a Mumford and Sons reference?"
39:33;39:34;"- It was a little Mumford."
39:34;39:36;"This is like--you're talking about the era in New York"
39:36;39:39;"where everybody was into old-timey stuff."
39:39;39:41;"- Yeah. - So you were ahead of your time"
39:41;39:42;"in terms of menswear,"
39:42;39:44;"because you were getting into this kind of"
39:44;39:46;"""Grateful Dead"" T-shirt, hippie vibe,"
39:46;39:48;"when a lot of guys were being very uptight,"
39:48;39:50;"getting the Nazi haircut and the bow tie."
39:50;39:52;"So maybe in the professional environment,"
39:52;39:54;"you're doing something different,"
39:54;39:55;"but on the home front,"
39:55;39:57;"now you got your girlfriend,"
39:57;40:00;"who went on to become the mother of your child,"
40:00;40:01;"thinks you're a poser."
40:01;40:02;"- Oh, she knows."
40:02;40:04;"- Did she try to break up with you?"
40:04;40:05;"Why did she stay with you?"
40:05;40:07;"- 'Cause she's smart, you know?"
40:07;40:08;"She knows that it's all fun and games."
40:08;40:09;"It's Halloween every day."
40:09;40:11;"She knows more to ""hyphen"" porn"
40:11;40:13;"than she knows I live for a costume."
40:13;40:16;"You know, I live to, like, you know, be zig-zag."
40:16;40:17;"- But so did it hurt your feelings"
40:17;40:20;"that you come home and your wife is calling you a poser?"
40:20;40:21;"- Big time."
40:21;40:22;"No, I took the shirts."
40:22;40:23;"I literally put them on bottom to bottom"
40:23;40:24;"to the bottom of the dresser,"
40:24;40:25;"and then three years later,"
40:25;40:26;"I go to Beacon's Closet,"
40:26;40:27;"they don't even want to buy them."
40:27;40:29;"- Whoa. - Yeah, fast forward."
40:29;40:30;"- Bottom of the market."
40:30;40:32;"Did she try to turn you on to the dead?"
40:32;40:33;"- No, not once,"
40:33;40:34;"which I also really appreciate,"
40:34;40:36;"'cause a lot of the people that have,"
40:36;40:37;"I would never talk to them again."
40:37;40:40;"You know, they play the [bleep] for you on a car ride."
40:40;40:41;"It's a six-hour car ride,"
40:41;40:42;"and they play ""Grateful Dead."""
40:42;40:44;"I want to pull over after the first 30 seconds"
40:44;40:45;"and hitchhike."
40:45;40:46;"I'm not a big hip-hop disc guy,"
40:46;40:48;"but that [bleep] was killing me."
40:48;40:52;"Now I really want to hear a banjo mandolin, you know?"
40:52;40:53;"- No, I don't know."
40:53;40:55;"- So, wait, so this is--"
40:55;40:57;"- And what do you want to hear, Kanye?"
40:57;40:58;"- No. - Okay, wait, so, Mordecai,"
40:58;41:00;"how come you like the music now,"
41:00;41:01;"but you didn't like it before?"
41:01;41:03;"- It's a really good question, you know?"
41:03;41:05;"People are asking me, ""What'd you think of the show?"""
41:05;41:06;"And I'm getting these responses."
41:06;41:08;"You know, the first set was a heater."
41:08;41:09;"Took them a couple songs to get it tight."
41:09;41:11;"""Cold Rain"" is one of my top ten."
41:11;41:12;"It crushed me."
41:12;41:14;"You know, ""Weird Jazz,"" you know,"
41:14;41:17;"all their language is so cool."
41:17;41:19;"How they use the words ""soft"" and ""fragile."""
41:19;41:20;"You know, I like that."
41:20;41:22;"And I like music that takes me places."
41:22;41:25;"I'm a Chesunissia guy from Brooklyn Crown Heights, you know?"
41:25;41:26;"And when I hear a banjo,"
41:26;41:28;"I think I'm at a bluegrass festival"
41:28;41:30;"with a bunch of cool hippies that I didn't grow up with."
41:30;41:33;"We all want what we didn't have, I think, anyway."
41:33;41:35;"So I like that kind of stuff."
41:35;41:37;"- So in a way, your interest in the T-shirts"
41:37;41:39;"came before your interest in the music,"
41:39;41:41;"and you have no shame in that."
41:41;41:42;"- Oh, no way at all."
41:42;41:43;"No shame at all."
41:43;41:44;"And not in a way."
41:44;41:45;"In the way."
41:45;41:47;"- So you're actually happy it panned out that way."
41:47;41:48;"- Oh, yeah, man."
41:48;41:50;"I mean, I went to Petaluma."
41:50;41:53;"I went to all the crazy places from San Francisco"
41:53;41:55;"all the way to Napa and all the places in between."
41:55;41:57;"I went to every single flea market there."
41:57;41:59;"If a guy didn't wash the shirt for 30 years"
41:59;42:00;"since his last dead show,"
42:00;42:03;"I'd pay ten times the price that he wanted to just for it."
42:03;42:04;"You know?"
42:04;42:05;"People don't understand."
42:05;42:07;"You can just go buy a new liquid blue shirt"
42:07;42:09;"or a new M65, you know,"
42:09;42:11;"without having the blood, sweat, and tears"
42:11;42:12;"that went through it."
42:12;42:13;"That s--t is priceless."
42:13;42:15;"- Well, that's something I've always noticed about you"
42:15;42:16;"is that you respect--"
42:16;42:18;"whether or not you like the culture,"
42:18;42:22;"you respect the people whose clothes reflect,"
42:22;42:23;"like, their life."
42:23;42:24;"- This is true."
42:24;42:26;"I mean, but these clothing tell stories."
42:26;42:27;"- So you bought some cool gear there,"
42:27;42:29;"but what about just the general fashion"
42:29;42:30;"of the people at the show?"
42:30;42:31;"Were you impressed?"
42:31;42:33;"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
42:33;42:34;"I was so unimpressed."
42:34;42:37;"You know, GQ was smart to have me shoot it,"
42:37;42:38;"but they had me shoot outside."
42:38;42:40;"Inside, you know, I don't really take pictures inside,"
42:40;42:41;"but I did a little bit of that."
42:41;42:42;"I did a lot of exploring."
42:42;42:43;"I ran around."
42:43;42:45;"I went the second night, too."
42:45;42:48;"And there's so many Yeezys and stuff,"
42:48;42:49;"and not as many Birkenstocks,"
42:49;42:52;"which kills me because I spent the whole show--"
42:52;42:55;"both shows-- just trying to see Bob Weir, Bob Weir,"
42:55;42:58;"just to see if he was wearing socks with his Birkenstocks."
42:58;42:59;"And I was pretty close,"
42:59;43:02;"and I couldn't get a good view of Weir,"
43:02;43:03;"but I understand."
43:03;43:04;"The first night I saw--"
43:04;43:05;"- So you don't think--"
43:05;43:06;"it's not cool for a young guy"
43:06;43:08;"to wear Yeezys to the Dead show?"
43:08;43:09;"Isn't that best of both worlds?"
43:09;43:10;"- No, it's not."
43:10;43:13;"- What do you want to see from somebody's fashion"
43:13;43:15;"at a Dead & Company show in 2017?"
43:15;43:18;"- I want to see a Birkenstock taken to the St. Mark's"
43:18;43:20;"and put on a 7-inch sole"
43:20;43:22;"if they want to do something modern to it, you know?"
43:22;43:26;"I want to see people take the Balenciaga Crocs"
43:26;43:27;"and wear those."
43:27;43:28;"I want comfort, you know?"
43:28;43:30;"The Yeezy's, that [bleep] is not comfortable."
43:30;43:31;"Or maybe it is."
43:31;43:32;"I never really tried them on."
43:32;43:33;"But it's funny."
43:33;43:35;"These kids, you know, I met a kid on Instagram."
43:35;43:36;"I met a kid."
43:36;43:37;"This is a real story."
43:37;43:38;"He's like 21."
43:38;43:40;"He buys and sells Palace & Supreme"
43:40;43:42;"just to support his Dead habits."
43:42;43:43;"And he's one of the biggest dealers"
43:43;43:45;"of, like, vintage Grateful Dead."
43:45;43:46;"I will not drop his name."
43:46;43:48;"- Okay, I know, but I follow some of these guys,"
43:48;43:50;"these kind of Instagram Dead guys."
43:50;43:52;"Yeah, it seems like there's this weird intersection"
43:52;43:53;"of old Grateful Dead T-shirts"
43:53;43:55;"but also, like, new Supreme stuff."
43:55;43:56;"- Yeah."
43:56;43:57;"- Did you see any of these--"
43:57;43:59;"we were just reading this old jury quote"
43:59;44:01;"about how at a Grateful Dead show"
44:01;44:03;"back in the day, you'd be getting"
44:03;44:05;"everybody from Wall Street guys to young hippies."
44:05;44:08;"Did you see any guys straight from the office"
44:08;44:10;"wearing their uptight corporate style?"
44:10;44:12;"- Yes, I'd like to see that quote"
44:12;44:14;"because there was tons of that."
44:14;44:16;"Tons and tons and tons of the retro acts"
44:16;44:18;"over a button-up with khakis."
44:18;44:19;"Tons on Tuesday."
44:19;44:20;"Last night, tons."
44:20;44:21;"I was blown away."
44:21;44:23;"- Do you think that's a respectable look,"
44:23;44:25;"like the corporate lawyer who takes off"
44:25;44:27;"a little early to go catch the Dead in Kosho?"
44:27;44:28;"- It is and it isn't."
44:28;44:30;"It is because he's coming straight from work"
44:30;44:32;"and you gotta appreciate a guy that did that"
44:32;44:34;"and not a clown like me that took three days"
44:34;44:35;"to get dressed, you know?"
44:35;44:37;"Like, this guy's--don't go in to see something"
44:37;44:38;"he loved and grew up with"
44:38;44:39;"and he doesn't care what he looks like."
44:39;44:41;"He's not gonna put on a costume, you know?"
44:41;44:43;"And there's me that couldn't tell you one song"
44:43;44:45;"and I did everything except for put on makeup, you know?"
44:45;44:47;"- All right, well, at least you're keeping it real."
44:47;44:49;"Well, so, Morgot, I love talking to you always"
44:49;44:51;"and I love hearing your take on the Dead and the show."
44:51;44:53;"I'd be remiss not to ask you,"
44:53;44:57;"as one of the preeminent chroniclers of style"
44:57;44:58;"of our time,"
44:58;45:00;"if Grateful Dead shirts have kind of come into fashion"
45:00;45:02;"in the past few years,"
45:02;45:03;"what's coming back next?"
45:03;45:06;"- All I can think about is John Mayer's cropped T-shirt"
45:06;45:07;"on Sunday."
45:07;45:08;"That's all I can think about."
45:08;45:10;"It was, like, so perfectly cropped"
45:10;45:12;"and I can't make fun 'cause he's a rock star"
45:12;45:14;"but if you wore that on the street"
45:14;45:15;"while you are a rock star,"
45:15;45:17;"that's s--t for the stage."
45:17;45:19;"So, if that guy can wear that on stage,"
45:19;45:20;"what's gonna stop some kids--"
45:20;45:21;"- Wait, wait, I don't understand."
45:21;45:22;"'Cause he-- - What's a cropped T-shirt?"
45:22;45:23;"- Like, he was showing his belly?"
45:23;45:24;"- Oh, midriffed?"
45:24;45:26;"- This shirt that John was wearing"
45:26;45:27;"was either capital or vismin."
45:27;45:31;"And the back was just, just higher than the front."
45:31;45:32;"It wasn't showing the belly."
45:32;45:35;"It wasn't showing, like, a tramp stamp kind of thing."
45:35;45:37;"It could've been his guitar that was doing it"
45:37;45:39;"but it's bulls--t it wasn't his guitar that was doing it."
45:39;45:41;"It was cropped, just so."
45:41;45:43;"- So you were seeing too much of his lower back"
45:43;45:44;"for your taste?"
45:44;45:45;"You didn't like it?"
45:45;45:46;"'Cause it kind of seems to me,"
45:46;45:47;"I keep seeing more and more John Mayer's"
45:47;45:49;"becoming a style icon."
45:49;45:50;"I see people be like, you know,"
45:50;45:52;"John Mayer buys expensive sneakers."
45:52;45:55;"- You know, I'd rather talk about his style"
45:55;45:58;"than Sheila Booth's fake non-style."
45:58;46:00;"Tell me about your Lithuania tee."
46:00;46:01;"Do you know what year it's from?"
46:01;46:03;"- Oh, my Lithuania tee?"
46:03;46:04;"I think it's from '94."
46:04;46:05;"- Where did you buy it?"
46:05;46:08;"- On Etsy, from Dead Shaman Supply."
46:08;46:10;"You think my Lithuania tee's fake?"
46:10;46:12;"- He sells a lot of repros."
46:12;46:13;"He doesn't sell all repros,"
46:13;46:14;"but he sells a lot of repros."
46:14;46:16;"- But don't you feel like, who cares if it's a repro?"
46:16;46:17;"You know, like, at a certain--"
46:17;46:19;"if you're talking about authenticity--"
46:19;46:20;"- Oh, I do, I do."
46:20;46:22;"That's why my wife made me throw out all the T-shirts."
46:22;46:24;"But this--it's a big problem with the repros."
46:24;46:27;"Because if you look at Liquid Blue,"
46:27;46:29;"anything after '95 is trash."
46:29;46:32;"It looks like they took screenshots of the T-shirt"
46:32;46:33;"and made the screenshot a T-shirt."
46:33;46:36;"And if you look at, like, this kid Deadhead's Instagram,"
46:36;46:37;"you'll see the difference."
46:37;46:38;"- I know his Instagram."
46:38;46:40;"- Yeah, I mean, I don't want to shout anybody out,"
46:40;46:42;"but it's just, like, really interesting,"
46:42;46:44;"the whole Lithuania thing, you know?"
46:44;46:45;"- Look, I agree with you."
46:45;46:49;"It's cooler just to be-- have an old T-shirt,"
46:49;46:50;"but if you want to get a T-shirt,"
46:50;46:53;"I don't know, dropping $400 is not cool."
46:53;46:54;"In my book."
46:54;46:56;"- No, and also, I know--a lot of guys,"
46:56;46:59;"maybe you included, I don't know this much about you,"
46:59;47:01;"a lot of guys I know, they don't want the snow."
47:01;47:04;"They don't want the holes in the T-shirt, you know?"
47:04;47:06;"So, fine, buy something new."
47:06;47:08;"Better that than Jerry Lorenzo, you know,"
47:08;47:10;"fear of God, you know, pre-age [bleep]"
47:10;47:13;"But the problem is the double RL and the pre-age stuff,"
47:13;47:15;"it's like it looks just so fake."
47:15;47:19;"But getting a good Liquid Blue on Heat Ashbury for $25,"
47:19;47:20;"you know, or your Lithuania T,"
47:20;47:22;"if you don't know it's real or not,"
47:22;47:24;"I don't mind that, but if it comes with fake holes,"
47:24;47:25;"that's a problem."
47:25;47:26;"- I got you."
47:26;47:27;"All right, well, Mordecai,"
47:27;47:29;"a pleasure as always talking to you."
47:29;47:31;"- Yeah, next we'll talk about what's next."
47:31;47:32;"- Next we'll talk about--I can tell--"
47:32;47:34;"Okay, I understand, you don't want to give away"
47:34;47:35;"all your secrets."
47:35;47:36;"- No, 'cause I know Levi's and Gap"
47:36;47:37;"and all the hot brands, you know,"
47:37;47:39;"they listen to this show."
47:39;47:41;"Urban Outfitters, you know, we can't give it all."
47:41;47:42;"- Okay, well, we'll talk to you soon."
47:42;47:44;"Thanks for calling in, dude."
47:44;47:45;"- Thank you so much for having me."
47:45;47:46;"- Have a good one. - Have a great night."
47:46;47:47;"- Bye."

01:08:06;01:08:11;"We saw them, saw the nerds, the jocks, having a good summer night."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"We were a little too old for that."

01:08:29;01:08:31;"[laughs]"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"All right, I was too hard on this song."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"It's kind of deep."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"It's about the--"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"It's classic Eagles."
01:08:48;01:08:51;"On the surface, it's very stock."
01:08:51;01:08:54;"And then when you spend a little time with it, you're kind of like, ooh."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"I'm starting to feel you."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Yeah, think about that."
01:08:57;01:09:02;"Next time you're out on a Friday night watching all the young people having fun"

01:09:22;01:09:24;"Let's see what we can glean from the number five song."
01:09:24;01:09:27;"Oh, the number five song in 2017."
01:09:27;01:09:28;"Yeah."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Post Malone featuring 21 Savage."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"You remember this song?"
01:09:30;01:09:31;"Oh, yeah, sure."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"So number five was the Eagles, a rock band in 1979."
01:09:34;01:09:37;"Number five in 2017 is ""Rock Star."""
01:09:39;01:09:41;"This song's been on the charts for a while."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"This is a huge song."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"It's one of the biggest songs of the year so far."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Wow."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"This is a shift in life."
01:10:02;01:10:07;"I feel like most songs now--I guess it's always kind of been like this,"
01:10:07;01:10:11;"but the perspective of that Eagles song, it's like somebody's going to this,"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"somebody's going to that, there's going to be a heartache tonight,"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"just that kind of like neutral narrator."
01:10:15;01:10:16;"You don't get a lot of that."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"Now it's always like I feel like a rock star."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"It's me."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Just imagine a song that's like--"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"It's like you don't get a lot of somebody songs."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Glenn didn't write in the first person really."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Interesting."
01:10:44;01:10:47;"That part's better."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"Listen to that."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"Listen to that little vibrato."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Something really interesting happens with his voice."
01:10:52;01:10:56;"I don't know if it's the auto-tune or that's just his natural vibrato."
01:10:56;01:11:00;"[vocalizing]"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"It's an effect, right?"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Or does he go--"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"[vocalizing]"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"It might be his natural vibrato interacting with the auto--I don't know."
01:11:07;01:11:08;"Yeah."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"[vocalizing]"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"I'm with the band."
01:11:18;01:11:22;"Reminds me of the Neil Young song ""Cinnamon Girl."""
01:11:22;01:11:23;"I can see that."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"When the girl's waiting backstage."
01:11:25;01:11:28;"The drummer relaxes and waits between shows."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"[laughter]"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"You know what?"

01:26:25;01:26:30;"Now the sky's blackening I know the mark's high but a fly's rip apart my stomach"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"Knowing that no matter what bars I come with you're gonna heart gripe"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"And that's a hard fight getting to swallow"
01:26:35;01:26:40;"So I scrap these as pressure increases like khakis"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"I feel the ice cracking because"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"Wait, wait, what the hell is he talking about?"
01:26:45;01:26:48;"Okay, well, so you know, there's an interesting podcast"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"that Rick Rubin started a new podcast where they talk about the songs."
01:26:51;01:26:55;"I listened to it, so I have some more info to contextualize the song."
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Okay."
01:26:56;01:27:00;"Apparently the song is about Eminem feeling like"
01:27:00;01:27:04;"for all of his success, he's kind of painted himself into a corner"
01:27:04;01:27:07;"because when you get to your seventh or eighth album,"
01:27:07;01:27:12;"you've explored so much territory that in some ways you've kind of done it all."
01:27:12;01:27:15;"And now every move you make is like a high wire act"
01:27:15;01:27:18;"where it's like you can't please everybody anymore."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Now Eminem's shown his serious side. He's shown his silly side."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"He says some people hear a new song from me and they say like,"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"""Oh, how come he's not doing that old school hip hop?"""
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Or they hear some old school sh*t and it's like,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"""How come he's not keeping up with the times?"""
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Or, ""Why is he being all whiny and serious?"""
01:27:31;01:27:37;"You know, so I think the song is about him reckoning with his place in culture"
01:27:37;01:27:43;"and the difficulty of being a very successful artist with a lot of pressure on you."
01:27:43;01:27:49;"You can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"That's right."
01:27:50;01:27:53;"But so I think he's saying why are expectations so high?"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"He said it's almost like he's a victim of his own success."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"All right. Well, that's not interesting at all."
01:27:59;01:28:03;"You're not interested in Eminem's struggles with his self and his artist--"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Not in that respect."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"One thing that I want to know is what does he mean when he says,"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"""As pressure increases like khakis""?"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Yeah, I don't know what that means."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"I feel the ice cracking."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Wait, you think you know what it means?"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"Oh, okay. Yeah, okay."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"Eminem's just--he's too smart for me actually."
01:28:19;01:28:23;"""As pressure increases like khaki."""
01:28:23;01:28:26;"You know, that's one of those things where it's either like super smart or super dumb."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"That's the thing with wordplay."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"I'm probably guilty of this too."
01:28:29;01:28:34;"Wordplay can either be this sublime thing where something has multiple meanings"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"and you found a way to use language in a fun way"

01:30:25;01:30:27;"because if you're remotely interested in him--"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"I gotta check it out."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"At least you get some weird insight."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"And you can tell--this is a dude--one thing I'll say,"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"from everything I've ever heard about him, read about him,"
01:30:34;01:30:36;"in his own words, other people's words,"
01:30:36;01:30:43;"he truly is a super intense, hard-on-himself perfectionist"
01:30:43;01:30:48;"versus, say, a kid rock who seems just like a showboating, ego-driven dude."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"Eminem seems like a genuinely tormented dude"
01:30:51;01:30:57;"who really wants to be great, really cares about craft."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"And we could listen to this song and maybe we don't like it that much or whatever,"
01:31:00;01:31:06;"but Eminem truly is a dude who's all day long thinking about his lyrics"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"and working at them."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"He's like Leonard Cohen."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"He is like Leonard Cohen."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"And kid rock is like Kiss."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Yeah, exactly."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Eminem is gravitas."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"He's hard on himself."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"And there's an interesting part where he talks about how"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"when he was a kid growing up listening to Tupac,"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"he had this epiphany where he realized--he was saying,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"""Why is Tupac so good?"""
01:31:26;01:31:28;"Because some people listen to Tupac, they just love it,"
01:31:28;01:31:32;"and then the future rappers of the world listen to Tupac and say,"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"""How does this work?"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"They take it apart."
01:31:34;01:31:35;"What makes this good?"""
01:31:35;01:31:39;"And Eminem's big insight with Tupac was he said Tupac's lyrics"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"moved with the chord progression."
01:31:41;01:31:44;"It wasn't just like he picked a set of words to say"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"and then put them over the beat."
01:31:46;01:31:51;"He would make sure that certain lines corresponded with the emotional part"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"of the chord progression."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"So if it hit a chord that was minor,"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"he would make sure that that's where he was saying something dark"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"or something that fit with it."
01:31:59;01:32:03;"And Eminem realized there was kind of a--almost like a Jerry Garcia-esque"
01:32:03;01:32:08;"lyricism in the way that he was matching words to the chord progression."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"And Eminem realized that's something that he wanted to do."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"And it's not something that every rapper does."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"Whether or not you like Eminem, that's a guy who's thinking."
01:32:15;01:32:18;"♪ 'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic ♪"

01:32:22;01:32:23;"He wrote Stan."
01:32:23;01:32:25;"I think that's also Eminem."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"You never know where you stand with the guy."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"Is he just this emotional wreck?"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"Is he just all in his head?"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"And then he makes this kind of emotional song,"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"and then at the very last minute, he snaps out of it."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"He's calling me a [bleep]"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Yeah, he's calling you, Jake, a [bleep]"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"He's got three verses."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Hey man, I'm with you on your journey."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"Yeah, of just kind of being like, ""And everybody's so hard on me,"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"and because I'm so good!"""
01:32:51;01:32:53;"And I'm like, ""I feel you, dog. I feel you."""
01:32:53;01:32:54;"I'm a legendary rapper!"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"I feel your pain, man."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"The pressure gets to me."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"It increases like caggies."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"And then Beyonce's final lines, she gets real emo."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"""If I walked on water, I'd drown."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"I'm human just like you."""
01:33:06;01:33:09;"And then Eminem, he could have left it there."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Let Beyonce have the final word."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"The whole point of the song is to say Eminem is a flawed human"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"who's hard on himself just like everybody."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Give him a break."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"Then Eminem thinks about it, and as the door closes,"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"he bursts back into the room and says, ""Jake, you're a [bleep]!"""
01:33:23;01:33:26;"And I wrote, ""Stan, you're nothing."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"I'm the greatest."""
01:33:27;01:33:31;"And I say, ""That's one of your weaker numbers, bud."""
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Stan?"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Stan's a classic song."
01:33:34;01:33:39;"Your verses on 2001 are your best work, sir."
01:33:39;01:33:43;"If I walk down water, I'd drown."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"One last thing, [bleep] all you guys!"

01:33:52;01:33:54;"[Bleep] you!"

01:37:59;01:38:01;"Yeah, like, CDs were invented in the '70s."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"Really?"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Yeah."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Wow."
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Any of our older listeners who were..."

01:38:12;01:38:16;"If you were trying to set a mood, what did you do?"
01:38:16;01:38:21;"And if you were rich folks who had a fancy dimmer, you probably also had a CD player"

01:38:22;01:38:23;"That doesn't count."
01:38:23;01:38:30;"I just wanted to say, any of our kind of Joe Schmoe 1979 listeners, what did Joe Schmoe"

01:40:27;01:40:29;"Yeah, he's written all sorts of hits for other people."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"He's written some--"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"He's written one of Justin Bieber's best songs,"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"""Love Yourself."""
01:40:33;01:40:36;"He's written one of our favorite songs,"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"""Your Body is a Wonderland,"""
01:40:38;01:40:40;"and ""I Know It Like a Backroad."""
01:40:40;01:40:41;"What was that song called?"
01:40:41;01:40:42;"Wait, the Sam Hunt?"
01:40:42;01:40:45;"No, what was his song about knowing your body?"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"What's it called?"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"""Shape."""
01:40:47;01:40:48;"Oh, ""Shape of You."""
01:40:48;01:40:49;"I'm in love with ""The Shape of You."""
01:40:49;01:40:50;"Yeah, that's--"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"That's when America was really into body songs."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"But Ed Sheeran can often be great"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"at, like, just finding a slice of life."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"This song, to me,"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"there's some really standout moments, but--"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"And look, we're talking about a world-class songwriter,"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"so I hope people don't think I'm being harsh,"
01:41:03;01:41:06;"but we're holding him to his own standard, Eminem style."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"To me, this is not one of his best songs"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"just because there's a lot happening."
01:41:10;01:41:14;"Like, ""Shape of You,"" it's a very specific story."
01:41:14;01:41:17;"You meet the girl, you go to the Chinese buffet,"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"you go home and have sex,"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"and now you can't get her body off your mind."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"That's what he-- You know, this song,"
01:41:21;01:41:22;"it's about a lot of things."
01:41:22;01:41:24;"It's like this-- It's about a relationship,"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"and you don't even get to, like, the important moment"
01:41:27;01:41:30;"until, like, the very end of the chorus."
01:41:30;01:41:31;"He's talking all about, like,"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"""I didn't know I was gonna meet you,"""
01:41:32;01:41:35;"and you're-- And then suddenly you get to the heart of it,"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"the hook, which is,"
01:41:36;01:41:39;"""We were dancing, feet on the grass,"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"""we're having a beautiful night,"

01:41:44;01:41:47;"""and then I say underneath my breath for some reason,"
01:41:47;01:41:50;"'You look perfect,' and you heard it."""
01:41:50;01:41:51;"Everything-- You know what I mean?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Like, Ed Sheeran sometimes--"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"He's a master storyteller."
01:41:54;01:41:57;"When he talks about taking the girl to the Chinese buffet,"
01:41:57;01:42:00;"you can taste the sweet and sour chicken, generally."
01:42:00;01:42:03;"This one is just not clicking into focus for me."
01:42:03;01:42:04;"So anyway, in this weird moment,"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"it's like, again, it brings up all these questions."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Why did he say it underneath her breath?"
01:42:08;01:42:11;"If a girl tells you in a self-deprecating way,"
01:42:11;01:42:14;"""I look like a mess today,"" and you disagree,"
01:42:14;01:42:15;"say, ""No, you look great."""
01:42:15;01:42:17;"But he said it underneath his breath"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"'cause he was too shy to-- I don't get it."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"The song's called ""Perfect."""
01:42:21;01:42:22;"You know what I mean?"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"It's just not his-- It's not in focus."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"# Well, I found a woman"
01:42:27;01:42:31;"# Stronger than anyone I know"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"# She shares my dreams, I hope... #"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"Maybe I'm being too-- I guess the positive interpretation"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"would be that this is just an impressionistic journey"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"through his love for somebody,"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"and he's jumping from kind of, like, statements about them"
01:42:44;01:42:47;"to this moment they spent together dancing."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"# To carry love, to carry children"
01:42:50;01:42:52;"# Of our own... #"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Whoa."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"# We are still kids, but we're so... #"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"Smash cut forward to the..."
01:42:57;01:42:59;"# To carry love, to carry children of our own... #"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"I guess, yeah, he's jumping back and forward in time."
01:43:02;01:43:06;"# I know we'll be all right"
01:43:06;01:43:09;"# This time"
01:43:09;01:43:12;"# Darling, just hold my hand"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"# We might go on being... #"
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Like, this part makes sense."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"# I see no future... #"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"He's just saying ""a lot"" in this song."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"Yeah."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"So, like, right there, he could have been done, and now..."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"# I know we'll be all right"
01:43:26;01:43:27;"# Darling... #"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"It's just like a hodgepodge of cliches."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Right."
01:43:31;01:43:32;"# You between my arms... #"
01:43:32;01:43:35;"Maybe he was like, ""I gotta finish this song now."""

01:43:47;01:43:48;"You know what?"
01:43:48;01:43:52;"Throw in the Eric Clothin ""Wonderful Tonight"" just to get a palette."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"OK. A palette cleanse."
01:43:54;01:43:58;"Yeah, just in terms of, like, a very focused relationship song."
01:43:58;01:44:00;"Well, that's very straightforward. It's about..."
01:44:00;01:44:01;"Yeah, but it's focused."
01:44:01;01:44:05;"It's about, ""We're going out tonight, and you look wonderful tonight."""
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Yeah. Period."

01:44:15;01:44:17;"Ooh."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"So much more tasteful."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"Oh, my God."
01:44:21;01:44:25;"So slow."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"In, like, a super confident way."
01:44:27;01:44:30;"Tasteful palette levels stabilising."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"HE LAUGHS"

01:44:38;01:44:41;"He's setting the table. He's painting a picture."

01:44:43;01:44:45;"Literally... What clothes to wear."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"She's just going through her closet."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"I don't always do this."
01:44:49;01:44:53;"Sometimes out of... cos I'm not capable or just cos I don't want to,"
01:44:53;01:44:58;"but I do love a song that in the first two lines summarises the whole song."

01:45:19;01:45:20;"Oh, oh."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Somebody's going to use it."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Now people think, ""What's going to happen with this gun?"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"""Something's going to happen with it."""
01:45:25;01:45:29;"And just like Eric Clapton, a lesser songwriter would just be painting"

01:45:46;01:45:48;"and then we'll find out what the song's about?"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"No, that is what the song's about."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"That lady who's feeling the pressure..."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"She's trying on her fourth outfit."

01:45:58;01:46:00;"that judges women based on how they dress."
01:46:00;01:46:05;"And now I'm wondering, Eric Clapton, is he going to be some macho d***head"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"who's like, ""Babe, it's not hot enough."""
01:46:07;01:46:09;"We're about to find out."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Is he going to support..."

01:46:16;01:46:19;"# Brushes of long blonde hair #"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"It's like a weird white suit with a belt..."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:22;01:46:25;"So he changed too. He came home."
01:46:25;01:46:29;"He was playing soccer with his mates. He came home, showered."
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Put on a suit."

01:46:40;01:46:41;"Oh, yeah."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"Can we listen to the whole thing? Let's just keep it going."
01:46:44;01:46:46;"I also just love that it's like..."
01:46:46;01:46:50;"When you really think, what are the great songs about?"
01:46:50;01:46:55;"This is a song about telling a woman she looks great."

01:49:06;01:49:09;"This song, it's really like a--"
01:49:09;01:49:12;"it's very meaningful that at the end,"

01:49:15;01:49:17;"He says, ""You are wonderful."""
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Yeah."
01:49:18;01:49:21;"It's--I love--when you actually zoom out,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"I love it."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"This is like--it's a three-act play."
01:49:24;01:49:25;"Yep."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Act one."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Clapton's waiting downstairs."

01:49:33;01:49:34;"""Do I look all right?"""
01:49:34;01:49:36;"And he looks at her and says, ""You look amazing."""
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Doesn't give her a hard time about it."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"""Fellas..."""
01:49:39;01:49:41;"Who knows what he's actually thinking?"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"It doesn't matter."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"He knows that she was just feeling really vulnerable upstairs,"
01:49:44;01:49:45;"trying on stuff."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"Yep."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"He says, ""You look great."""
01:49:47;01:49:49;"They go to the party."
01:49:49;01:49:50;"He thinks about--"

01:49:54;01:49:56;"Time to go home."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"She drives home."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"He gets in bed, turns out the lights,"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"and just says, ""You're a wonderful person."""
01:50:02;01:50:07;"It's just a snapshot of one night in the life of a couple."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"Yeah, a night they probably won't remember."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Yeah."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Just a random Friday night."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"That's something that, you know, pop music's a great art form for"
01:50:15;01:50:22;"is taking a kind of mundane event in the lives of regular people"
01:50:22;01:50:26;"and making it beautiful with tasteful guitar solos."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"Where's the Ed Sheeran one?"
01:50:27;01:50:28;"It's all over the place, man."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"And you know what?"
01:50:29;01:50:31;"Ed Sheeran, again, I truly stand by he's a great songwriter."
01:50:31;01:50:32;"I'm sure he'll write--"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"I think he could have just written a few different songs"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"within the realm of perfect."
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Ed's got a long career ahead of him."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"He'll get his wonderful night."
01:50:40;01:50:41;"I was also going to say,"
01:50:41;01:50:44;"I think you can write a great impressionistic song too"
01:50:44;01:50:48;"that maybe is not as specifically about a night we went out and came home."
01:50:48;01:50:53;"But if you want to talk about that kind of going back and forth through time"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"and thinking about memory and when you first got with somebody"
01:50:56;01:50:59;"and how things changed and hitting impressionistic moments,"
01:50:59;01:51:02;"which is what Ed Sheeran seems to be trying to do perfect,"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"I mean, you can't beat ""Brown Eyed Girl"" Van Morrison for that."
01:51:05;01:51:06;"Oh, my God."
01:51:06;01:51:09;"Now, you can't say ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is about anything as neat,"
01:51:09;01:51:10;"as wonderful tonight,"
01:51:10;01:51:15;"but that's just like a great impressionistic thing about memory and love."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I feel bad."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"We've been kind of hard on Ed on this one,"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"but it's only because we love ""Shape of You"" so much"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"as one of the masterworks of songwriting"
