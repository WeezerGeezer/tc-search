00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, Season 2, Episode 2."
00:05;00:10;"This week we'll be mourning the loss of musical legend Prince, calling a bunch of our friends"
00:10;00:11;"to talk about it."
00:11;00:17;"We'll also be talking about flame wars, and I'll be revisiting the battleground with music"
00:17;00:20;"journalist Zachary Lopez."
00:20;00:24;"Plus Jake and I will be talking about the New York closed primary."
00:24;00:30;"And of course, we'll be counting down the top 5 hits of 1968 and 2016."
00:30;00:34;"This is Time Crisis, with Angela Kane."
00:34;00:37;"P-p-p-p-p-p-piece 1."
42:49;42:52;"Time Crisis Enemies."
42:52;42:55;"So I knew who you were from following music journals."
42:55;42:58;"You sometimes write for Pitchfork, Vice."
42:58;43:01;"Yeah, I want to clarify that I don't do reviews for Pitchfork."
43:01;43:02;"You don't do, oh really?"
43:02;43:03;"I only did humor."
43:03;43:04;"Oh, okay."
43:04;43:05;"Quote, unquote humor."
43:05;43:07;"Right, okay, and so you also write for Vice."
43:07;43:08;"Yeah."
43:08;43:11;"Oh, I didn't know for sure, but I had a feeling you made some snarky comments"
43:11;43:16;"about Vampire Weekend before, but again, nothing that seemed like truly offensive."
43:16;43:19;"Everybody likes different stuff, and you know, nothing that bothered me."
43:19;43:20;"But so here's what bothered me."
43:20;43:26;"I heard a friend tells me, ""Did you read this essay about New York that was in Vice?"""
43:26;43:27;"And I said, ""No."""
43:27;43:28;"He said, ""Oh, it's going kind of viral."""
43:28;43:32;"And essentially my friend said, ""It's an essay about how everybody's moving to L.A.,"
43:32;43:33;"but they're never going to move to L.A."
43:33;43:36;"They're loyal to New York, and they're talking about a lot of things"
43:36;43:40;"like gentrification and, you know, why they love New York"
43:40;43:44;"and why they think moving to L.A. is corny or something."""
43:44;43:45;"Tell me if I'm--"
43:45;43:48;"It's a tough one because I think a lot of times when people say, like,"
43:48;43:52;"""Oh, it was just a joke,"" you know, that's a way of sort of--"
43:52;43:55;"you can't take issue with it because I was kidding."
43:55;44:01;"But it was, and perhaps it failed at this, it was intended to be a humorous essay"
44:01;44:03;"touching on serious things."
44:03;44:06;"I mean, basically Vice wrote me or called me up and was like,"
44:06;44:10;"""Hey, will you write an essay about how you're never going to leave New York?"""
44:10;44:12;"And here's the thing."
44:12;44:15;"So then my friend says, ""Yeah, my brother really liked it."
44:15;44:18;"These are like lifelong New Yorker types."""
44:18;44:20;"But there's this one part where they kind of diss Vampire Weekend."
44:20;44:22;"And this is before I even knew who wrote it."
44:22;44:24;"I heard about it, and I was like, ""Oh, no."
44:24;44:27;"What did they say? I don't remember. You should go look at it."""
44:27;44:29;"So when I got home, I looked at it."
44:29;44:30;"He totally remembered what it was."
44:30;44:32;"He just said he didn't want to be the person to tell you."
44:32;44:33;"Perhaps."
44:33;44:36;"So then I see it, and then I'm like, ""I don't even know."""
44:36;44:39;"Somehow I saw that basically there's a part where he said to everybody"
44:39;44:43;"who's moving to L.A., ""Take Vampire Weekend with you."""
44:43;44:46;"And let's be clear. It was a throwaway line."
44:46;44:48;"Okay, I know it was a throwaway line."
44:48;44:52;"But because the essay had elements of humor but also touching on serious topics,"
44:52;44:54;"it bothered me more than normal."
44:54;45:01;"And also I think at one point I saw that the music critic Jessica Hopper"
45:01;45:03;"specifically highlighted that line."
45:03;45:05;"And I have nothing against Jessica Hopper."
45:05;45:07;"She is a great journalist."
45:07;45:09;"Well, I do want to just--because I was going to say this at some point"
45:09;45:12;"because I knew it would come up--I do want to say that I think a lot of the"
45:12;45:15;"criticism you guys have gotten is unfair."
45:15;45:20;"Some of the criticism you've gotten from me is unfair because I do--I mean, I take--"
45:20;45:24;"I certainly have always aspired to be more of just a writer, period."
45:24;45:28;"And I know that sounds really pretentious, but I'm kind of pretentious."
45:28;45:30;"Me too."
45:30;45:33;"And more than I want to be a music writer, so I've always been more interested in"
45:33;45:36;"is this entertaining to read, is this stylistically interesting."
45:36;45:39;"Seeing somebody who I knew had negative feelings toward Vampire Weekend--"
45:39;45:42;"and I'm not questioning her credentials as a critic--"
45:42;45:46;"specifically shout out this line as if it was this really funny thing,"
45:46;45:48;"""Take Vampire Weekend with you."""
45:48;45:55;"Again, I have to say I think it's really corny when--and I see this all the time--"
45:55;45:59;"you get a bad review and then somebody writes, ""You know, it's okay not to like my band,"
45:59;46:03;"but actually your grammar is terrible, and actually you don't know what"
46:03;46:07;"syncopation really means, and you don't know what a half note is."""
46:07;46:10;"And I think that's so corny, it's so condescending when it's like,"
46:10;46:12;"""Somebody didn't like your music."""
46:12;46:15;"Like, trust me, I know people don't--not everybody likes Vampire Weekend."
46:15;46:20;"And even just to say Vampire Weekend sucks, Vampire Weekend's corny, my voice is wack--"
46:20;46:24;"all that stuff I've over the years been able to deal with."
46:24;46:27;"The reason this set me off--and I think it was because I saw this line highlighted"
46:27;46:32;"by another somewhat well-known music journalist--I was like, ""Hmm."""
46:32;46:37;"I know this is supposed to be a satirical piece, but it hit home for me because"
46:37;46:47;"I felt that Vampire Weekend is somehow symptomatic of new, horrible, capitalist New York"
46:47;46:50;"that's driving out real New Yorkers and stuff."
46:50;46:54;"I think that's a fair way of taking it. It's not--it wasn't my intention."
46:54;47:00;"I mean, I've over the years taken a lot of pleasure out of disliking your band,"
47:00;47:04;"but obviously--but just in a sort of general, almost theoretical way--"
47:04;47:07;"Well, yeah, everybody needs their punchline. I have my punchlines."
47:07;47:09;"I can't say them publicly, but I have my punchlines."
47:09;47:11;"Of course, and I have that luxury."
47:11;47:16;"Because I'm unsuccessful in a lot of ways, I'm always punching up because, you know,"
47:16;47:18;"there's very few people below."
47:18;47:19;"It's legit."
47:19;47:24;"It was totally just a cheap shot, and the piece would not be diminished in the slightest"
47:24;47:26;"if it had been omitted, you know?"
47:26;47:30;"So certainly in retrospect, when I sort of had to, like, all of a sudden deal with"
47:30;47:35;"a human being whose feelings I had hurt, you know, I regretted the line."
47:35;47:38;"You know what, man? I'm going to stop you right there. Let's listen to some tunes."
47:38;47:46;"She wears an awful coat of make, even in the summertime."
47:46;47:53;"Everybody knows from a quarter mile away, the girl's got a lot on her mind."
47:53;48:01;"She's got big, big thoughts, big dreams, and a big promise, ain't it sad?"
48:01;48:08;"Would have thought this girl, if she really was, to be in love with a man."
48:08;48:15;"She wants to be a glamorous life, she don't need a man's touch."
48:15;48:22;"She wants to be a glamorous life without love, it ain't much."
48:22;48:37;"[instrumental]"
48:37;48:44;"She saw him standing in the section marked, you have to ask your care if you're in danger."
48:44;48:51;"She threw a grin, said, ""Make me scream."" In the dark, what could he say?"
48:51;48:58;"Boys with small talk and small minds really don't impress me in bed."
48:58;49:06;"She said, ""I need a man's man, baby, diamonds and thirst, love would only conquer my head."""
49:06;49:14;"She wants to be a glamorous life, she don't need a man's touch."
49:14;49:21;"She wants to be a glamorous life without love, it ain't much."
49:21;49:50;"[instrumental]"
50:19;50:35;"[instrumental]"
50:35;50:39;"Time Crisis Enemies"
50:39;50:44;"You also, and I think I said this to you later because we started emailing afterwards."
50:44;50:46;"It's one thing for somebody to say, ""Vampire Weekend's pretentious,"" what can I say?"
50:46;50:50;"Somebody says, ""Vampire Weekend makes me think of annoying Ivy League stuff."""
50:50;50:54;"Again, I went to this school and I went on TV wearing a cricket sweater."
50:54;50:57;"I can't say anything about that."
50:57;51:00;"But there's something specifically about, and this goes beyond you,"
51:00;51:05;"there's something specifically about me saying gentrification, New York changing."
51:05;51:09;"And maybe I have my own feelings about so many people moving to LA"
51:09;51:12;"and even the fact that I have to spend increasing amounts of my time in LA"
51:12;51:18;"that made me maybe with some sort of guilt about the fact that my dad grew up in projects in the Bronx"
51:18;51:21;"and now I've become a symbol to somebody who doesn't even know me or something."
51:21;51:27;"But yeah, it made me really want to clarify something about my relationship to the city."
51:27;51:32;"And is that because you did something so bad or because I had a chip on my shoulder that I needed to get off?"
51:32;51:33;"I think more of the latter."
51:33;51:38;"You've discussed a lot of this stuff before in terms of your relationship to New York."
51:38;51:40;"Yeah, you discuss this stuff, but then sometimes you feel like--"
51:40;51:43;"you talk about it in one interview with a sympathetic journalist,"
51:43;51:47;"but sometimes you feel like, whatever, people are still just going to make you a punchline."
51:47;51:52;"And if they want to, turn you into the gentrifying monster or Eric Trump or something."
51:52;51:53;"Right."
51:53;51:55;"This made me really reactive."
51:55;51:56;"No, of course."
51:56;52:00;"I mean, I thought one of the things that was interesting when we were emailing back and forth was--"
52:00;52:04;"and I thought really a point that you sort of made to me that kind of made me kind of wince"
52:04;52:08;"because it was a fair--I don't think you were even trying to take a jab at me,"
52:08;52:14;"but you were sort of saying it's just having someone who moved here for the arts and the culture like I did"
52:14;52:21;"and then to be sort of taking jabs at someone who is certainly more from here than I am who is--"
52:21;52:23;"Yeah, and I don't even like getting into that, like, who's--"
52:23;52:26;"Yeah, but it's a--you can, though. It's our history."
52:26;52:28;"I've always thought, like, who's a real New Yorker, who's not a New Yorker."
52:28;52:31;"For me, I'm fundamentally from the tri-state area."
52:31;52:33;"Born in Manhattan."
52:33;52:35;"Mom was born in Manhattan. Dad was born in the Bronx."
52:35;52:41;"Grandma and Grandpa were born in Harlem, East New York, the Bronx."
52:41;52:44;"You know, great-great-grandfather, Lower East Side."
52:44;52:49;"So to me, I never get into this whole, like, New Jersey is not part--you know, I'm from the tri-state area."
52:49;52:50;"I'm--"
52:50;52:53;"New Jersey hardcore is an essential part of New York."
52:53;52:55;"Yeah, and also I think--"
52:55;52:57;"There would be no Rorschach if it weren't for New Jersey."
52:57;53:04;"And I think I said to you in the thing that it's hard to shake that feeling that when you see somebody"
53:04;53:08;"make a joke and part of your brain tells you it's a throwaway joke and part of you has a feeling like,"
53:08;53:10;"""This person hates me."""
53:10;53:11;"Sure."
53:11;53:14;"""I have an enemy."" And in fact, that's something I also want to talk about is because one thing that's been"
53:14;53:18;"interesting to me about Twitter, which in many ways ruins lives--"
53:18;53:19;"Yeah."
53:19;53:23;"--causes anxiety, depression, or let's say exacerbates."
53:23;53:24;"Exacerbates, yeah."
53:24;53:25;"It really--"
53:25;53:26;"Romanticizes."
53:26;53:28;"Romanticizes. It's a brutal place in many ways."
53:28;53:31;"But one thing that I like about it is because deep down, I always--"
53:31;53:32;"I love Twitter."
53:32;53:38;"I've fully bought into this whole musicians versus critics as natural enemies because straight up,"
53:38;53:39;"there's a side of me that's a music critic."
53:39;53:42;"And I even feel like I only wrote one review."
53:42;53:43;"Technically, I wrote two reviews."
53:43;53:51;"But also, the way I think about music is so deeply formed by growing up, reading zines,"
53:51;53:53;"even Rolling Stone's Magnet--"
53:53;53:55;"I had a subscription to Magnet."
53:55;53:59;"It's so deeply formed by music criticism that I really think music criticism and making music are so tied"
53:59;54:01;"to similar thought processes."
54:01;54:03;"You're a musician and a critic."
54:03;54:09;"So I never like this kind of false dichotomy of like, well, you got the critics who wish they were musicians."
54:09;54:12;"Then you got the musicians doing something pure, and they naturally hate each other."
54:12;54:15;"And it's been interesting to me to sometimes-- it's been good to remind myself."
54:15;54:22;"I follow a lot of music journalists on Twitter because deep down, even though some of them don't like me,"
54:22;54:23;"those are my people."
54:23;54:24;"I like the way that music journalists think."
54:24;54:28;"And sometimes I see the way that music journalists-- they have their own haters too."
54:28;54:29;"Oh, yeah."
54:29;54:33;"I think Twitter made everybody-- it used to be the musicians were the most vulnerable,"
54:33;54:35;"but now everybody's vulnerable in a similar way."
54:35;54:43;"Now that a lot of critics sort of operate more as cheerleaders for musicians until one musician stumbles,"
54:43;54:45;"and then they all pile on."
54:45;54:48;"But generally, they're all about being positive."
54:48;54:51;"Now they just really attack each other."
54:51;54:54;"Because on Twitter, we're all just individuals."
54:54;54:59;"Whether your background is making music, writing about music, anything, we're all kind of there equally."
54:59;55:00;"Let's listen to some tunes."
55:00;55:02;"[MUSIC - THE CREATURES, ""NEVER OUT OF BODY""]"
55:24;55:46;"[MUSIC - THE CREATURES, ""NEVER OUT OF BODY""]"
55:46;55:50;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
55:50;55:52;"Hey, what's up, Makona?"
55:52;55:53;"Hey, what's up?"
55:53;55:56;"Hey, man, you're here on Time Crisis with Ezra and Jake."
55:56;55:58;"Hey, guys, what's up?"
55:58;55:59;"How you doing, man?"
55:59;56:01;"We're over here just processing the loss of musical legend,"
56:01;56:02;"Prince."
56:02;56:04;"So we wanted to reach out to some of our friends"
56:04;56:07;"and talk about what he meant to everybody."
56:07;56:08;"Are you a fan?"
56:08;56:10;"The thing in my life with Prince is"
56:10;56:13;"the first song I ever danced to was Prince's ""Party Man"""
56:13;56:16;"off the Batman soundtrack back in the day."
56:16;56:17;"Really?"
56:17;56:19;"Yeah, so that was a big-- that was my first song"
56:19;56:20;"I ever danced to."
56:20;56:23;"And I was-- you know, that was like, I've loved Prince"
56:23;56:26;"ever since then and stuff and just everything about him."
56:26;56:29;"But me and my mom were joking because I started"
56:29;56:30;"this song, ""Man of the Party."""
56:30;56:31;"Oh, yeah, of course."
56:31;56:32;"I love that song."
56:32;56:35;"Yeah, it was like, now you're like the man of the party."
56:35;56:37;"Remember when Prince was the man of the party?"
56:37;56:38;"You were dancing to ""Party Man""?"
56:38;56:40;"Now he grew up with it, you know."
56:40;56:42;"So that was like that little thing about that."
56:42;56:43;"But man, Prince was a legend, man."
56:43;56:45;"Like, he knew how to play all these instruments"
56:45;56:51;"and just putting on new chords and new sounds and new looks"
56:51;56:56;"and just pushing the envelope so far for even people like me"
56:56;56:59;"to exist now and be blessed to have a career"
56:59;57:01;"in this music industry."
57:01;57:05;"So I'm just like-- I'm sad, but very honored"
57:05;57:07;"and just thankful for Prince."
57:07;57:08;"You know what I'm saying?"
57:08;57:09;"Yeah, for sure."
57:09;57:12;"It's very hard to imagine the musical world,"
57:12;57:14;"how different it would be without him."
57:14;57:17;"[music - ""man of the party""]"
57:41;57:42;"Beats 1."
57:42;57:46;"You are now listening to ""Time Crisis."""
57:46;57:49;"Unless you're not listening to ""Time Crisis,"" in which case,"
57:49;57:51;"you are not hearing me say this."
57:51;57:56;"So Zach, I really appreciate you coming in."
57:56;57:59;"I'm very happy to meet you."
57:59;58:00;"Thank you."
58:00;58:03;"I know-- and here's the truth, is that you have been"
58:03;58:05;"a very respectful person."
58:05;58:07;"I definitely-- I do have to take some responsibility"
58:07;58:08;"for slightly overreacting."
58:08;58:10;"But I'm glad that we got to talk, because the first--"
58:10;58:13;"the main thing is not so much like--"
58:13;58:15;"sometimes we human beings, we get set off."
58:15;58:17;"You said something, things get lost in communication,"
58:17;58:21;"but over the long term, you were a good person."
58:21;58:23;"You were willing to listen to me, hear my point of view."
58:23;58:25;"You didn't, like-- you didn't, like, roll over,"
58:25;58:28;"but you treated me like a human being,"
58:28;58:30;"and you-- yeah, you didn't say any of the kind of like,"
58:30;58:32;"""Oh, whatever, man, who cares?"""
58:32;58:33;"And I appreciate that."
58:33;58:36;"Well, no, no, I'm really glad, and of course,"
58:36;58:41;"the downside of all that is, you know, there's a good reason"
58:41;58:44;"why a lot of times critics and musicians"
58:44;58:46;"shouldn't be interacting on Twitter, or shouldn't--"
58:46;58:47;"you know, because--"
58:47;58:49;"Right, but maybe the genie's out of the bottle now."
58:49;58:50;"Well, here's the thing, because I was--"
58:50;58:51;"I was-- I've been thinking about it a lot."
58:51;58:53;"I was like-- you know, and I made jokes about it,"
58:53;58:55;"even on Twitter.com, being like,"
58:55;58:58;"""I'm running out of bands to make fun of,"
58:58;59:00;"because I keep meeting all these f---ers."""
59:00;59:05;"And, you know, but obviously, the world of criticism,"
59:05;59:08;"the world at large, will not be diminished"
59:08;59:12;"by me no longer being about Vampire Weekend, you know,"
59:12;59:13;"and--"
59:13;59:16;"And there are so-- my list, my list is so long."
59:16;59:18;"And there's always somebody new coming,"
59:18;59:19;"and the truth is, maybe--"
59:19;59:20;"See you soon, Spoon."
59:20;59:21;"Right."
59:21;59:23;"And maybe you'll figure out other ways"
59:23;59:24;"to critique Vampire Weekend,"
59:24;59:27;"even brutally critique Vampire Weekend."
59:27;59:31;"But anyway, before you go, I've been primarily talking to you"
59:31;59:33;"as a musician to a music journalist,"
59:33;59:35;"because we said you are a musician, too,"
59:35;59:38;"and like I said, those roles are very fluid."
59:38;59:42;"And so let's listen to some music from your band."
59:42;59:43;"Thanks. Yeah."
59:43;59:45;"And tell me a little bit about your band,"
59:45;59:46;"and then announce the song."
59:46;59:49;"I'm in a band called Publicist UK."
59:49;59:51;"Great name. I'll admit, that's a great name."
59:51;59:54;"Yeah, well, there was already a band called Publicist,"
59:54;59:56;"which obviously we wanted to be called just Publicist,"
59:56;59:59;"but then out of loving tribute to, you know,"
59:59;01:00:02;"London Suede and Shelton's UK and things like that,"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"we just threw the UK-- English beat."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"English beat, exactly."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"What song should we play?"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"Let's-- Canary. We're going to do Canary."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Okay. You know, let's play two songs."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Canary into what?"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Canary into Levitate the Pentagon."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Okay. Also a great name."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Thank you to my guest, Zachary Lopez."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Thank you for having me."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"My former low-level flame war."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"And maybe someday again."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"And maybe someday we really can't--"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"this conversation definitely does not--"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"Inshallah, we'll do it again."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"--does not mean we'll never have a flame war again."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"But here's Publicist UK with Canary"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"and then Levitate the Pentagon."

01:09:34;01:09:36;"That was my interview with Zachary Lippez"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"back in New York, and that was his band Publicist UK."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"That last song's called ""Levitate the Pentagon."""
01:09:41;01:09:42;"I like it. It's heavy."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"It reminds me of stuff that I like, too."
01:09:44;01:09:47;"Some, like, darker '80s goth stuff. I like it."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"Kind of a Helmet vibe."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"I never listened to Helmet that much."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Okay."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"I like--but I like--"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Someone out there in Radioland is feeling me on that call."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"I remember there was a kid I grew up with who liked Helmet,"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"but--but, okay, first of all, one thing I'll say."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"I like that kind of music,"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"but it's very different than Vampire Weekend,"
01:10:01;01:10:02;"so I can understand, like--"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"and after talking to him,"
01:10:03;01:10:06;"the kind of music that he likes is kind of like,"
01:10:06;01:10:07;"in a way, no frills."
01:10:07;01:10:10;"It's dark, it's heavy, and they do it well,"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"but I can understand--you know, Vampire Weekend,"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"especially the early stuff, a little more twee."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"Poppy."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"Poppy, rocking the sweaters,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"little Baroque and classical touches."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"Mm-hmm."
01:10:20;01:10:21;"I kind of--it's not for everybody."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"And you guys were image-conscious."
01:10:23;01:10:26;"Very--and some people don't even like image-consciousness, period."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Yeah."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"Let alone when the image is this kind of, like, you know,"
01:10:29;01:10:32;"being into boat shoes and stuff."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"I'm still into clothes."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Yeah."
01:10:35;01:10:36;"I don't wear boat shoes that much anymore."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Lately, I've been into big T-shirts."
01:10:38;01:10:39;"I'm noticing that right now."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Yeah, I'm wearing, like, a double XL T-shirt."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"I thought it was an interesting look."
01:10:43;01:10:46;"Yeah, I just got over wearing tight T-shirts,"
01:10:46;01:10:49;"but anyway, I was glad that I sat down with him,"
01:10:49;01:10:52;"'cause the truth is, the more I think about it,"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"did I overreact in starting a flame war with him?"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"Well, I'm not mad about it,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"'cause we actually had a pretty respectful dialogue,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"all in all, but, you know,"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"he was just kind of doing his job."
01:11:00;01:11:02;"Vice asked him to write something."
01:11:02;01:11:04;"He had kind of a throwaway line about Vampire Weekend."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"I can't take it super personally, and we got to talk."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"We got to talk a little bit about New York,"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"and at the end of the day, after we did the interview,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"we enjoyed talking to each other, so we were like,"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"""Let's go get some food and some brews,"""
01:11:17;01:11:18;"and we went down to a restaurant."
01:11:18;01:11:22;"We kind of sat there as the returns from the primary were coming in."
01:11:22;01:11:25;"We both kind of were hoping Bernie was going to win."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"He didn't."
01:11:26;01:11:28;"We talked about it, and it was kind of interesting,"
01:11:28;01:11:31;"and so all in all, I can say he's a good dude,"
01:11:31;01:11:35;"and in the future, I'm really going to try not to get in flame wars"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"with music journalists, 'cause deep down,"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"I do feel like we're all team music, you know?"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"Yeah."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"The Internet's weird that way."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Imagine if, back in the day,"
01:11:44;01:11:47;"if Billy Joel had sat down with Robert Christgau."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Like, would they even have agreed to do that?"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"I mean, that's like the classic little back story, basically."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"Christgau had always--"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"Hated Joel."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"Just, like, yeah, destroyed his albums and reviews,"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"and then Joel would be up on stage reading the reviews"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"that Christgau had written about him."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"I can just picture that, just in between songs."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"He was like the original Kanye,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"Billy Joel just, like, ranting on stage."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"He's like, ""Get a load of this guy."
01:12:12;01:12:16;"""He says that I'm cheesy, I'm not as deep as Springsteen."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"""Wow."
01:12:17;01:12:20;"""Well, who made him the king of rock and roll?"""
01:12:20;01:12:22;"You know what, though?"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Here's one thing."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"If Billy had sat down with Robert Christgau and said,"
01:12:25;01:12:26;"""You know what, man?"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"""You've been talking all this s--t to me."
01:12:29;01:12:34;"""I'm just, like, a young, Italian-identifying Jewish man"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"""just trying to get my foot in the door,"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"""and you're hurting my feelings."""
01:12:37;01:12:38;"And Christgau's like, ""You know what, man?"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"""Now that I see you, and I know you're a good guy"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"""who's just trying to get out there"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"""and get his name out there,"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"""I'm gonna stop clowning on you."""
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Maybe we wouldn't have gotten some of those classic"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"angry Billy songs, like,"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"♪ Still rockin' road to me ♪"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Like, all that anger would have just been, like, gone."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"Well, thank God that didn't happen, then."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"I know. So, yeah, so, like, you start playing with--"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"you go back in your time machine."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"Who knows?"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"I mean, but I also feel like Christgau--"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"I don't know a ton about him,"
01:13:03;01:13:05;"but I feel like he would have stood his ground."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"Maybe I'm just, like, romanticizing the old,"
01:13:07;01:13:09;"like, kind of, like, uh,"
01:13:09;01:13:12;"almost famous sort of vision of a rock writer."
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Right, that he would have just been like, ""No, I don't respect you."""
01:13:15;01:13:16;"It's, like, almost, like, moral or ethical."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"He'd be like, ""This is my opinion on your band."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"""You suck, and I'm never gonna back down on it."""
01:13:21;01:13:24;"So anyway, we could talk about critics and musicians forever,"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"and we'll probably-- I want to get some more critics on the show."
01:13:27;01:13:30;"Hopefully not all people I had flame wars with, but, you know,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"I believe-- again, I believe it's all--"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"it's all people who love music,"

01:17:50;01:17:53;"- Hi, Ezra and Jake. How's it going?"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"- Well, we're bummed over here"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"because of the death of musical icon Prince,"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"and we wanted to talk to friends of the show"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"about their relationship to Prince."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"- Yeah, it's pretty devastating."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"I'm pretty sad. I mean, I feel like"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"Prince was kind of everything to me for so long,"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"my childhood especially, but I don't know."
01:18:11;01:18:18;"Like, he was so funky and so perennial, timeless."
01:18:18;01:18:23;"Hit every genre in his own special way, just really..."
01:18:23;01:18:28;"I mean, you know, his contribution is ridiculous."
01:18:28;01:18:31;"- It's true. Did you ever meet him?"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"- I met him once."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"I think he, like, by accident showed up"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"at my 30th birthday party,"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"which was a nice accident for me."
01:18:39;01:18:43;"He was a little shy, and I was definitely very shy."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"- He was shy? - He's a little shy, yeah."
01:18:45;01:18:47;"He was a little shy."
01:18:47;01:18:49;"- He didn't come up and say--"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"and introduce himself and say, ""Happy birthday""?"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"- No, I wouldn't introduce myself."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"- Really? - That's what you do with Prince, yeah."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"- You just-- - Of course."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"- It's corny to go introduce yourself to Prince."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"- No, I mean, you have to,"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"'cause he's not gonna do it to you."
01:19:03;01:19:05;"- Oh, you have to? - Yes, you have to."
01:19:05;01:19:08;"- So you went up and said hi? - I went up and said hi, yeah."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"- And what did he say?"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"- He said hi. He was sweet. He smiled."
01:19:12;01:19:15;"I said it was my birthday. He said, ""Happy birthday."""
01:19:15;01:19:17;"And then he kicked it in the corner."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"- And then he vanished? - And then he vanished, yeah."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"- And it wasn't-- 'cause people always used to say"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"that Prince and Michael Jackson had a rivalry."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- Yeah, that was real."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"- So he might have thought, for obvious reasons,"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"that you were Team Michael Jackson."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"- Oh, that's maybe true, yeah. No, I was very--"
01:19:33;01:19:36;"I mean, I feel like my heart was occupied"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"equally by Prince and Michael Jackson"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"for kind of different reasons."
01:19:40;01:19:43;"I feel like, yes, they definitely rivaled each other,"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"in kind of androgynous, sexy,"
01:19:46;01:19:49;"boundary-pushing pop ways,"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"but there was something so different about them, you know?"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"Michael kind of had, like, a childlike thing,"
01:19:55;01:19:58;"and Prince was very much like a sexy man."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"- Oh, he was, yeah, very grown-up."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"- Yeah, grown-up and sexy."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"- What's your favorite Prince song, if you had to pick one?"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"- It's hard, but I love ""Raspberry Beret,"""
01:20:08;01:20:12;"and ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" is probably, like, tied for me."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"- Well, thank you, Rashida,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"for sharing your thoughts with Prince."
01:20:15;01:20:18;"I know a lot of us are devastated at the loss this week."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"- Yeah, thank you for including me."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"I think the best thing to do now"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"is to just kind of talk about how much we love him."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"- True. All right, we'll see you soon."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- Thanks, guys. - Bye."

01:22:03;01:22:05;"The number five song this week in 1968"
01:22:05;01:22:08;"was by Aretha Franklin, Queen of Soul."

01:23:19;01:23:21;"I remember now. - All right, who's Zayn?"

01:40:48;01:40:50;"What is she singing about?"
01:40:50;01:40:54;"Work means a lot of things. Yeah, it's interesting. It's a really interesting"
01:40:55;01:41:01;"word to make your chorus. One thing that a lot of people said about this song is that it's one"
01:41:01;01:41:08;"It's one of the big Rihanna singles that's the most difficult to understand and I don't it's not because of her accent necessarily because"
01:41:08;01:41:15;"Rihanna has sung many songs that yeah, it's a little easier for people to understand, but it's cool. It's like a more laid-back delivery"
01:41:26;01:41:32;"The lyrics are saying he said he he said me have to work work work work work"
01:41:32;01:41:39;"He he see me do me dirt dirt dirt. I think it's talking about a relationship and you know, it's interesting"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"There's another hit song right now. I guess not in the top five"
01:41:41;01:41:45;"That's also the course is basically work work work, but it's like about how you can work from you"
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Don't got to you don't got to go to work. It's by Fifth Harmony"
01:41:48;01:41:54;"So work is big in the atmosphere. So I guess we can make a case that everybody's singing about work because"
01:41:54;01:42:02;"It's an election year and we're like grappling with how hard Americans have to work just to keep their head above water, right?"
01:42:02;01:42:07;"Yeah, that's the classic narrative is that like Americans are working more and more and more and more every year"
01:42:07;01:42:13;"And that's so so work it's it's work is the is basically the repeated word in two big hit songs right now"
01:42:13;01:42:18;"Yeah, when I heard that Rihanna sounds like that's a dope and dark chorus"
01:42:18;01:42:24;"I didn't really and I didn't I didn't really even care right well, cuz even if the song is about a relationship it still is"
01:42:24;01:42:30;"Disseminating this word work over and over again. It's heavy. So can you also imagine and also the song is dark?"
01:42:30;01:42:35;"It's like kind of a somber tone. It's not like it's not like happy exactly, you know, just like the musically"
01:42:35;01:42:39;"Yes, just imagine how many people are just like literally just at work"
01:42:39;01:42:44;"You're just like at an office Depot like stocking the shelves. I know yeah, this is this is no"
01:42:44;01:42:50;"Yeah, but it's like just imagine that's like that's weirdly dystopian"
01:42:50;01:42:54;"It's just like imagine and I love this song and I'm not I'm not trying to say that"
01:42:54;01:43:00;"Rihanna is in any way trying to contribute to like a dystopian late capitalist"
01:43:01;01:43:07;"Nightmare, but yeah again. I love this image. You're just like somebody at work working for like a giant corporation, right?"
01:43:07;01:43:12;"And you're just there and they're like, hey guys, yeah, we're gonna pump in some tunes. You want to listen the radio?"
01:43:12;01:43:17;"Oh, yeah, sure put on the top 40 station. I like music and then you're just there like stocking the shelves and then you just hear"
01:43:17;01:43:22;"You got those inventory forms"
01:43:22;01:43:25;"The pallet jack around back"
01:43:28;01:43:31;"Okay, so basically no question so so she's unintentionally"
01:43:31;01:43:39;"We assume because the songs about a relationship. It's not about it's not a critique of late period capitalism. So she's like unintentionally"
01:43:39;01:43:47;"Creating this like weird critique that's happening in the environment people are working in and then it's weird to think about a band like"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"Radiohead or something that would very deliberately"
01:43:49;01:43:56;"Try to make a concept album about late period capitalism and like people being overworked"
01:43:56;01:44:00;"But how their music wouldn't be in that and you talk about working too hard. Yeah"
01:44:00;01:44:07;"No disrespect to it yet. No, well, first of all, I don't think you can take away the intentionality from Rihanna"
01:44:07;01:44:13;"Like isn't that the ultimate genius is that absolutely is that you write a song that's not on its surface about you're saying"
01:44:13;01:44:17;"Oh, I'm just talking about the work that goes into relationship. He told me I have to work but then"
01:44:17;01:44:23;"Ultimately, it's a stealth move. Yeah, it's so much better. No, I'm saying Rihanna's better than Radiohead. That's what I'm saying"
01:44:23;01:44:30;"Okay, it's more open to interpretation. It's not so over determined and like this is what we mean we are critiquing"
01:44:30;01:44:34;"computers and technology and like the alienation of"
01:44:34;01:44:40;"Society. Yeah, you know, it's funny. It's like it's not crazy to imagine Tom York on this imagine like this is also cool"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"How cool like pop music's become in?"
01:44:42;01:44:48;"In the sense that pop music and quote-unquote experimental weird music used to be a million miles apart"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"This has been talked about at length"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"Whereas now pop music takes what it wants and does everything with it"
01:44:53;01:44:59;"So like a sound that maybe in the past people have been like, oh, that's like some weird Radiohead sound Rihanna can use it"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"Yeah, it's got it but in an interesting way"
01:45:01;01:45:05;"So it's like imagine like imagine like mm radio had to put out a song and started like this"
01:45:05;01:45:09;"You'd be like, yep. Mm-hmm makes sense totally"
01:45:09;01:45:18;"The first song this is almost like a weird variation on the first song a kid a yeah"
01:45:19;01:45:25;"Everything in its right place and that's kind of like yeah, they can dude stocking shelves at the office Depot"
01:45:25;01:45:31;"We need to make like a dystopian just like stocking shelves mix that's just like"
01:45:31;01:45:38;"Work by Rihanna everything in its right place just on loop those two songs. Well, anyway, that's the top five"
01:45:38;01:45:47;"1968 versus 2016 who wins I gotta go 2016 not that I like any the music except the Rihanna song"
01:45:47;01:45:54;"But 68 was so weak. It's terrible. Remember when we were growing up and everybody's always saying like oh man, the 60s were so cool"
01:45:54;01:45:58;"Yeah, people still say that I don't think they say that anymore"
01:45:58;01:46:03;"Really? I think people might be like, oh there was cool stuff from the 60s"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"But nobody's ever like the 60s were cool"
01:46:04;01:46:11;"The people like the 60s was a crazy messed up time in American history and some good things started then"
01:46:11;01:46:15;"But nobody wants to go back to the 60s. Well, I don't know"
01:46:15;01:46:19;"I still see it as like a high-water mark culturally for the for the West. I"
01:46:19;01:46:22;"Mean, I'm not based on the top song"
01:46:22;01:46:28;"We caught a real a real lemon of a week. Well, that's also important to remember"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"Oh 1968 was like this big year everything was shifting in culture"
01:46:31;01:46:36;"People were like challenging norms and what were they listening to was all it was lady. No, it's amazing"
01:46:36;01:46:41;"How square the top five was? Yeah, so I to me I think 2016 mops the floor. Yeah"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"No, no, I agree and there you have it"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"I"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"Love you"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I"

01:51:30;01:51:42;"Every time your name was brought up I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience. Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on. But truth be told you threw me for a loop this whole. I'm too old to be fronting but I'm feeling dense."
01:51:42;01:52:08;"And acting like you ain't appealing when you are. Stepping like you ain't Moni girl when you are. I'm ready to stop when you are. I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off. I was just fronting. You know I want you babe. I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all. But you know I want you. You should stop fronting babe."
01:52:08;01:52:28;"Dance. Dance. Dance."
01:52:28;01:52:46;"Like this for real. Thank you babe. Look, I'm leaving now. I'm gonna see you later. I'm gonna sneak through your window. Bye."
01:52:46;01:53:14;"We made it through another episode. Season 2 is going pretty good so far. Time crisis. We had a lot of good people come through. Back in New York last week, thank you to Zachary Lopez. Formerly an enemy, now not an enemy. A colleague. Now a colleague. We had some good conversation. Thanks to Rashida Jones, Makonnen, aka I love Makonnen, and Dave1 from Chromio for sharing their Prince stories. Those are good stories."
01:53:14;01:53:28;"You know, obviously it's super sad when somebody dies. 57 is definitely too young. Super young. It's too young, especially for somebody who's so prolific. But it's interesting to see for different people exactly what he meant to them. Because he means different things to everybody."
01:53:28;01:53:43;"You know one thing I was thinking about recently, or Rashida told me this, is that I guess Michael, Prince, and Madonna were all born the same year. Three of these superstars, totally changing culture, and now only Madonna's left."
01:53:43;01:54:00;"Wow. That's heavy. But it kind of makes you think. I was actually talking about this because you know earlier we were talking about how my grandfather died. So essentially I have no grandparents left. I have one grandmother who's kind of like institutionalized. She's been living in a hospital room in the Bronx for the past few years."
01:54:00;01:54:17;"And I was talking with a friend about what does it mean we don't have any grandparents left. Because if your grandparents made it to an old age, it's not too brutal. Like they lived a good long life. You can't call it tragic exactly. So what does it mean when your grandparents left? And it kind of just means that the generations have shifted."
01:54:17;01:54:38;"It means these people that were always there, kind of holding it down on the outer end of the spectrum, they're gone. It means your parents are moving up to that next range of age. And it means you're moving up. And suddenly it's like you could kind of count on, well there's two generations above me. Now there's one generation above you. So there'll be no generations above you."
01:54:38;01:54:51;"That means you're next. It means the way you think about culture changes, the way you think about time changes. So in a way, these legends passing away, it feels kind of crazy. It's like Bowie and Prince in the same year. That's just the way of the world, man."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"That whole dang human comedy."
01:54:53;01:54:59;"Yeah, I mean who's the next generation after Prince, Michael, Madonna? Who's the next generation of superstars? Like Drake?"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Timberlake?"
01:55:00;01:55:06;"Yeah, sure. No, no. I'm just imagining like, hopefully we're all pretty fairly close in age."
01:55:06;01:55:09;"Is Justin Timberlake, he's younger than me. I'm 39."
01:55:09;01:55:22;"Yeah, he's probably like mid-30s. So, but let's say Justin Timberlake dies when Prince dies. I really got to make clear, I'm not wishing an early death on Justin Timberlake. I'm really just trying to think like actually in a deep emotional way about what this stuff means."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Yeah."
01:55:23;01:55:27;"So think about that. You'll be 62. So you'll be like kind of like an old dude."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Yeah."
01:55:28;01:55:35;"And you'll like be checking Twitter or whatever exists, the version of Twitter that exists then. Just be like, Timberlake's dead. However you feel about him, it's like."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Yeah."
01:55:36;01:55:51;"It's such a deep symbol of time passing. Anyway, we'll be back in two weeks with more Time Crisis. Truly, shout out to Prince, like absolute musical legend. Thank God we have your incredible body of work."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"39 studio albums."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"That's incredible."
01:55:54;01:56:03;"That's amazing. And written so many hits for other people that we can spend time with. And thanks for listening to Time Crisis. Thank you for being here with me, Jake. We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:56:03;01:56:32;"I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant. But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues. Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you."
01:56:32;01:56:47;"It's been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without its song."
01:56:47;01:57:07;"Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?"
01:57:07;01:57:24;"I've put my arms around every boy I see. They don't leave me anything."
01:57:24;01:57:48;"I went to the doctor and guess what he told me. Guess what he told me. He said, girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do. But he's a fool. Cause nothing compares. Nothing compares to you."
01:57:48;01:58:08;"Nothing compares to you."
01:58:28;01:58:44;"Flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard. All died in the wind today."
01:58:44;01:58:59;"I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard. But I'm willing to give it another try."
01:58:59;01:59:23;"Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you."
01:59:23;01:59:32;"Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you."
01:59:32;01:59:37;"Nothing compares to you."
