00:04;00:06;"This is a very major show."
00:06;00:08;"We'll be talking about the Wendy's mixtape"
00:08;00:11;"with the legendary T-Pain."
00:11;00:17;"We'll also be counting down the top 5 hits of today in 1985,"

00:19;00:23;"We'll also be talking about Diet Coke,"

00:26;00:27;"This is..."

00:48;00:51;"# My picture clear"

00:56;00:59;"# And so I dealt to the floor"

01:19;01:20;"What up, Jake?"
01:20;01:21;"Hey."
01:21;01:23;"Where you been? You're in Chicago?"
01:23;01:24;"Yep."
01:24;01:27;"I feel like we don't talk about Chicago very much on this show."
01:27;01:28;"That's true."
01:28;01:30;"Should we make this a very special Chicago episode?"
01:30;01:32;"I'm in, man."
01:32;01:34;"I've been listening to Smashing Pumpkins recently."
01:34;01:36;"Oh, getting ready for their big comeback tour?"
01:36;01:38;"Yeah, I want to go this summer."
01:38;01:39;"You want to go?"
01:39;01:41;"I want to go. I want to do a Time Crisis concert report."
01:41;01:42;"You're a fan?"
01:42;01:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:43;01:45;"So, in the '90s,"
01:45;01:47;"when you were listening to Guided by Voices and Pavement,"
01:47;01:49;"you also liked Smashing Pumpkins?"
01:49;01:50;"I did."
01:50;01:51;"'Cause for people who don't know,"
01:51;01:55;"Smashing Pumpkins is a rock band from Chicago."
01:55;01:58;"Rock is a form of music from roughly the..."
01:58;02:02;"Mid '50s to the early 2000s."
02:02;02:03;"Early 2000s."
02:03;02:05;"And they were a really big band in the '90s."
02:05;02:06;"Huge."
02:06;02:09;"And Pavement was more of an indie rock band,"
02:09;02:10;"and they had a slight rivalry"
02:10;02:13;"because there's a kind of weird, sarcastic Pavement lyric."
02:13;02:16;"♪ Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins ♪"
02:16;02:17;"And Billy Corgan heard that."
02:17;02:18;"♪ Nature kids ♪"

02:20;02:21;"Yep."
02:21;02:22;"♪ They don't have no function ♪"
02:22;02:25;"So, in Jake's estimation, Smashing Pumpkins, good band."
02:25;02:28;"Yeah, I love Smashing Pumpkins."
02:28;02:29;"Always have."
02:29;02:31;"You check out any Billy Corgan solo?"
02:31;02:33;"I checked out Zwan."
02:33;02:34;"Yeah?"
02:34;02:36;"He put out a record in, like, 2002."
02:36;02:38;"Oh, you're a Zwan fan, too?"
02:38;02:39;"Oh, yeah, Zwan, that record's great."
02:39;02:41;"But you haven't checked out Billy's solo stuff?"
02:41;02:42;"Mm-mm."
02:42;02:45;"Nor have I checked out any albums after Adore."
02:45;02:48;"But I will go to the mat for Adore,"
02:48;02:49;"which is a great record."
02:49;02:51;"Yeah, that was kind of like their last big album."
02:51;02:55;"Yeah, I mean, not like Siamese or Melancholy."
02:55;02:56;"Mm-mm."
02:56;02:58;"Definitely a step down commercially."
02:58;02:59;"Yeah."
02:59;03:01;"And in terms of visibility, but, yeah, great record."
03:01;03:04;"Were you in Chicago just doing Smashing Pumpkins research?"
03:04;03:05;"Yep."
03:05;03:08;"Yep, I was just checking out the old haunts."
03:08;03:13;"So, I got an email that JetBlue was doing some low rates"
03:13;03:15;"out to Chicago, so..."
03:15;03:17;"[ Both laugh ]"
03:17;03:19;"But it is funny, when I meet people from Chicago,"
03:19;03:21;"I always want to ask them about, like,"
03:21;03:22;"what was your vibe with the Pumpkins?"
03:22;03:24;"Oh, that's the first thing that you think of?"
03:24;03:25;"That's the first thing I think of."
03:25;03:27;"I'm like, ""Oh, you grew up there?"
03:27;03:28;"""Like, you were living there in the '90s?"
03:28;03:29;"""Like, did you see them?"
03:29;03:31;"""Did you think they were whack?"
03:31;03:33;"""Or, like, were they hometown heroes?"""
03:33;03:34;"Mm."
03:34;03:35;"Because they're a huge band,"
03:35;03:38;"intimately associated with Chicago,"
03:38;03:40;"but they have a lot of hate directed at them"
03:40;03:43;"because they're, you know, a little bit contentious."
03:43;03:46;"Well, and Billy Corgan was known as a kind of--"
03:46;03:48;"like a provocateur in some ways, and..."
03:48;03:51;"Yeah, and late period, Corgan's rough."
03:51;03:52;"Yeah."
03:52;03:55;"His vibe is, like, harsh, libertarian,"
03:55;03:56;"Alex Jones kind of..."
03:56;03:58;"Oh, right, he went on Alex Jones."

04:56;04:57;"No, no, it's--"
04:57;04:58;"Okay, I think I just assembled this."
04:58;05:01;"I was watching that Gary Shandling documentary on HBO."
05:01;05:02;"Right, heard about it."
05:02;05:04;"In the Gary Shandling documentary,"
05:04;05:06;"they keep interviewing Dave Coulier,"
05:06;05:09;"the comedian and actor who is famously Uncle Joey on..."
05:09;05:10;"Deep."
05:10;05:11;"...Full House."
05:11;05:13;"And I'm thinking about, oh, yeah, people always say"

05:17;05:18;"Right."
05:18;05:20;"...he was, like, the older man that she wrote"
05:20;05:21;"""You Ought to Know About."""
05:21;05:22;"Right."
05:22;05:24;"And I'm thinking about Alanis Morissette..."
05:24;05:25;"Yeah."
05:25;05:27;"...and then I just started watching some of her videos."
05:27;05:28;"This is a great rabbit hole, dude."
05:28;05:29;"Yeah, it's a good rabbit hole."
05:29;05:30;"And Alanis..."
05:30;05:31;"Solo?"
05:31;05:32;"Me?"
05:32;05:33;"Yeah."
05:33;05:34;"Oh, yeah."
05:34;05:35;"Just a solo laptop."
05:35;05:36;"I've been home alone this week, so..."
05:36;05:37;"In bed?"
05:37;05:38;"Solo laptop."
05:38;05:39;"In bed, 2 p.m."
05:39;05:40;"Okay, bed hang."
05:40;05:44;"No, this was nighttime, probably 11, 11.45."
05:44;05:47;"That's a solid time frame for this."
05:47;05:49;"So I'm setting the scene."
05:49;05:50;"Yeah."
05:50;05:51;"I'm watching the Shandling doc,"
05:51;05:53;"and you know that documentary's incredibly long."
05:53;05:54;"Yeah, I heard it's four hours."
05:54;05:56;"It's four-plus hours."
05:56;05:59;"I think that's, like, three hours too long for me."
05:59;06:00;"Perhaps."
06:00;06:03;"Whatever, I'm interested in Gary Shandling, so I liked it."
06:03;06:04;"But anyway, I needed a break,"
06:04;06:06;"so I'm looking for something to catch my eye."
06:06;06:08;"So I'm Dave Coulier and Alanis Morissette."
06:08;06:10;"That's something I could really sink my teeth into."
06:10;06:13;"And I'm not interested in the drama of their relationship."
06:13;06:15;"It made me think more about Alanis Morissette,"
06:15;06:18;"getting on the jagged little pill Wikipedia page,"
06:18;06:19;"things of that nature."
06:19;06:21;"And then I'm watching her videos,"
06:21;06:23;"and it started to make me really nostalgic"
06:23;06:25;"because I remember when that album came out."
06:25;06:27;"That was one of the first albums I really just remember,"
06:27;06:29;"like, kids at school kind of talking about."
06:29;06:32;"That was a big album, one of the biggest albums of the '90s."
06:32;06:35;"And I start watching the videos, and she had great videos."
06:35;06:38;"She's an incredibly charismatic entertainer."
06:38;06:39;"Okay."
06:39;06:41;"What? Disagree?"
06:41;06:44;"No, I don't disagree. I don't even remember the videos."
06:44;06:46;"I'll take Alanis over Corgan any day."
06:46;06:48;"As a performer?"
06:48;06:51;"As a charismatic entertainer."
06:51;06:53;"You know what? I might not fight you on that."
06:53;06:55;"Right, because that's not why you like the Pumpkins."
06:55;06:59;"She's not nearly the songwriter or guitar player or visionary that he is."
06:59;07:00;"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
07:00;07:02;"In terms of charismatic personality,"
07:02;07:05;"you can't get less charismatic than Corgan."
07:05;07:10;"Here we go again, the classic Billy Corgan versus Alanis Morissette divide"
07:10;07:16;"that has been destroying family holiday dinners since 1995."
07:16;07:17;"Toe to toe."
07:17;07:20;"I wonder if there's anybody listening to Time Crisis right now"
07:20;07:23;"who literally does not know who either one of those people are."
07:23;07:26;"Probably. Probably at least one person."
07:26;07:28;"A lot of people don't know who Billy Corgan is."
07:28;07:30;"Alanis--"
07:30;07:32;"Anybody who's listening to the show right now, if you're a group"
07:32;07:36;"or maybe you have a family, I'm picturing two parents and two children"
07:36;07:38;"in the car driving somewhere."
07:38;07:41;"Pause the show, go around in a circle, say,"
07:41;07:44;"""Who in the family knows who Billy Corgan and Alanis Morissette are?"""
07:44;07:46;"Maybe the parents do, maybe they don't."
07:46;07:49;"Children, no idea. I don't know."
07:49;07:52;"And you know what's amazing is that the big album, Jagged Little Pill,"
07:52;07:53;"she's only 21 years old."
07:53;07:54;"Wow."
07:54;07:58;"I actually really liked the lead single to her follow-up album."

18:55;18:56;"Yeah."

19:34;19:35;"rather than getting to spend it,"
19:35;19:37;"which you need to be alive to do, he dies."
19:37;19:40;"So it's fair to say that if she told the whole story,"
19:40;19:43;"you know, we see the world through this old man's perspective,"
19:43;19:49;"that yes, the opposite of what he hoped would happen, happened."

24:52;24:53;"Ironically--"
24:53;24:55;"She opened strong."
24:55;24:57;"To say that there is no--"
24:57;24:59;"that nothing in the song ""Ironic"" is ironic,"
