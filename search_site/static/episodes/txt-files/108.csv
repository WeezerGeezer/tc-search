00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again in 2020."
00:03;00:11;"On today's very special episode, Jake and I unite, and for the first time, we talk to Chris Kasky,"
00:11;00:16;"a co-founder of Pitchfork Music Festival and the writer of the infamous Jet Review."
00:16;00:22;"We also talk to Amy Brown, former Wendy's social media specialist, and hear about her wild ride"
00:22;00:25;"when it came to virality and savagely clapping back."
00:26;00:31;"This is a 2020 Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:19;01:24;"Time Crisis, back again. First show of 2020. What's up, Jake?"
01:24;01:28;"Happy New Year. Kind of late in the year to be saying that, but that's fine."
01:28;01:32;"Should we discuss it? That's kind of a really cliched thing to talk about."
01:32;01:32;"Yeah."
01:32;01:37;"We're not joined in the studio by Seinfeld. He's still abroad, I think, but it's a pretty"
01:37;01:42;"Seinfeld thing. In fact, I bet there is an episode of Curb that's just like, ""You know what,"
01:42;01:43;"January 15th?"""
01:43;01:44;"It's too late."
01:44;01:44;"It's too late."
01:45;01:50;"Well, because it's the first show of the year, kind of saying Happy New Year to the TC crew."
01:50;01:52;"Yeah, I think it's appropriate."
01:52;01:54;"People on Twitter were upset that-"
01:54;01:56;"Up in arms."
01:56;02:00;"The first episode isn't airing until, I don't know, what, three weeks in?"
02:00;02:03;"With the biweekly show, it's kind of funky."
02:03;02:03;"Yeah."
02:03;02:05;"And also, I was in Australia."
02:05;02:06;"Right."
02:06;02:11;"I was there for New Year's, even though our New Year's show was canceled."
02:11;02:12;"Due to a fire?"
02:12;02:17;"Due to the fires. We had four shows booked as part of this thing called Falls Festival,"
02:17;02:21;"kind of like a traveling festival where the artists go from place to place."
02:21;02:25;"And then we had two of our own shows. But so the show for New Year's, and we were supposed"
02:25;02:31;"to be on stage counting down, probably would have ripped some confetti, probably been like,"
02:31;02:34;"""Three, two, one, Happy New Year."""
02:34;02:40;"Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's what we did last time we were down there for New Year's."
02:40;02:42;"Whatever, we would have had a ball."
02:42;02:48;"But that show was in a place called Lorne, which is in Victoria, which is the state where Melbourne"
02:48;02:54;"is. But it's not really close to Melbourne. I have a memory of just being in a van for hours"
02:54;02:59;"to get there. But I think the way it was explained to us is there actually were already campers on"
02:59;03:04;"site, but it's not that that area was already on fire. It's just that the fires in the region were"
03:04;03:10;"so out of control. And that area was so vulnerable because it's like, you know, some kind of small"
03:10;03:14;"town, one road in, one road out through the hills or the mountains to the beach or something. And"
03:14;03:19;"they're just like, ""Listen, it's not a situation where we could, you know, if the fires get within"
03:19;03:23;"a hundred miles, we could just be like, you know what, pack it up. It would be a disaster getting"
03:23;03:27;"people in and out. It's way too dangerous."" And I was really into the idea of performing on New"
03:27;03:31;"Year's. You know, it's kind of like, you know what, less to think about. Just be down there,"
03:31;03:32;"playing a great show."
03:32;03:33;"Working."
03:33;03:37;"Just working. I love the idea of working on New Year's. And also, you know, sharing the joy of"
03:37;03:42;"music, but very specifically working. I think I would feel somewhat, obviously it's very different,"
03:42;03:47;"you know, playing a concert versus just like working at 7-Eleven. But I actually kind of think"
03:47;03:51;"if I worked at 7-Eleven and somebody was like, ""Who wants New Year's shift?"" I'd be like, ""Let me do"
03:51;03:54;"that one."" And then everybody'd be like, ""What do you have planned?"" I'd be like, ""I'm working."""
03:54;03:54;"I feel you."
03:54;03:58;"Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder like what the vibe is like in a typical 7-Eleven as"
03:58;04:00;"the clock strikes midnight."
04:00;04:06;"People like late to parties, picking up like 12 packs. ""Oh my God, it's 11 and 58!"""
04:06;04:10;"Yeah, a dude holding the 18-pack of Modelo that I'm looking at right now."
04:10;04:14;"Just like holding an 18-pack of Modelo. He just kind of like looks at the sales clerk."
04:14;04:19;"And then there's like, you know, some older dude in like pajama bottoms and a sweatshirt."
04:19;04:22;"Everybody just like kind of looks at each other just like, ""Ugh!"""
04:22;04:23;"Just like getting a hot dog."
04:23;04:27;"Happy New Year. Yeah. Also, it's funny, you know, when you're not in a party situation"
04:27;04:31;"or in like a formal event, because this is kind of what ended up happening to me."
04:31;04:35;"If you're not where there's an official countdown, I guess maybe somebody might have the TV on in a"
04:35;04:40;"convenience store. But there's also like that vibe of just kind of like nobody actually counted it"
04:40;04:43;"down. So it's, you know, it's like the clock just struck midnight and the guy with the Modelo is"
04:43;04:47;"like, ""Oh, yeah, happy New Year."" He's like, ""Oh, is it? Is it midnight?"" He pulls out his phone."
04:47;04:49;"""Yep, actually, it's 1201."""
04:49;04:55;"Well, or maybe like the TV is on in the convenience store and then like these strangers are just like,"
04:55;04:58;"""Are we doing this? Are we doing like a real half-assed countdown?"""
04:58;04:59;"This is a line of three people."
04:59;05:00;"Seven, six."
05:00;05:01;"Can I get a hot dog?"
05:01;05:03;"Five, four."
05:04;05:08;"You just imagine you're like fourth in line at Quick Check and just like you see it on TV and"
05:08;05:12;"just like everybody's kind of quiet. Just like doing, you know, ""Yeah, can I get a pack of"
05:12;05:16;"marble reds?"" And you're just like, ""Nine, eight, seven, six."""
05:16;05:24;"A few years ago, I was in line at a Best Western check-in in Honolulu, Hawaii."
05:24;05:25;"At New Year."
05:25;05:27;"Yes."
05:27;05:28;"This was on our trip."
05:28;05:30;"Yes, we took a trip to Hawaii."
05:30;05:30;"Oh, yeah."
05:30;05:34;"And then Hannah and I were flying back New Year's Eve for some reason."
05:34;05:36;"I don't know why we were doing that, but we were."
05:36;05:37;"That was a fun vacation in Hawaii."
05:37;05:38;"Yep."
05:38;05:41;"Jake and Hannah, me and Rashid, Ariel and Danielle. It was a great crew."
05:41;05:41;"Yep."
05:41;05:44;"I believe it was one of those situations where you guys had plans in LA."
05:44;05:47;"So we were all kind of like, ""Yo, stay. Yo, just stay."""
05:47;05:50;"And you guys were like, ""You know what? We got plans in LA. We've had fun,"
05:50;05:54;"but we're going to catch that early flight back and that way we can go to the party or whatever"
05:54;05:55;"in Los Angeles."""
05:55;05:58;"We were going to land at like 7 p.m."
05:58;05:59;"It was a reasonable plan."
05:59;06:01;"New Year's Eve, totally reasonable."
06:01;06:02;"And then we're on the flight."
06:02;06:06;"We're good like three hours into the flight over the Pacific and they're like,"
06:06;06:12;"""Ladies and gentlemen, we're turning the plane back around to Honolulu. We have a mechanical issue."""
06:12;06:14;"And that's stressful."
06:14;06:15;"And it's just like, ""Really?"""
06:15;06:19;"So then it's like, ""Turn it around three hours back to Honolulu."""
06:19;06:25;"And then so we get to Honolulu and it's like, I don't know, like 11, 15 p.m. at night."
06:25;06:29;"And then there's a whole, because there's a whole plane full of people trying to get hotel rooms in"
06:29;06:30;"Honolulu."
06:30;06:34;"There's a huge backup, the hotel shuttle, get to the hotel."
06:34;06:37;"Anyway, I just remember like standing in line."
06:37;06:38;"At the Best Western."
06:38;06:40;"It's like 11.58."
06:40;06:42;"This is literally you. You were in line in a public place."
06:42;06:44;"Was there a countdown happening?"
06:44;06:45;"There was no countdown."
06:45;06:51;"It was like a very dejected listless energy in the Best Western hotel lobby."
06:51;06:53;"And you must've been so burned out."
06:53;06:54;"We were bummed."
06:54;06:56;"And then, I mean, that sucks."
06:56;06:58;"Were you even aware when the clock struck midnight?"
06:58;06:59;"I think so."
06:59;07:00;"I think we were like standing in line,"
07:00;07:02;"doing that thing of like standing in line and looking at your phone."
07:02;07:03;"Yeah."
07:03;07:04;"Kind of zoned out."
07:04;07:06;"I've been there."
07:06;07:07;"Oh, it's 11.58."
07:07;07:09;"This sounds like something I may have talked about on TC before,"
07:09;07:13;"but I remember one time being in California."
07:13;07:14;"I was up in Palo Alto."
07:14;07:16;"I was staying with my girlfriend at the time."
07:16;07:18;"And I don't know if we were like jet lag."
07:18;07:22;"I can't remember what was going on, but I remember like hanging out at her family's house."
07:22;07:26;"And we were like thinking about driving into San Francisco on a holiday with traffic."
07:26;07:28;"Like that's a solid 50."
07:28;07:28;"Sure."
07:28;07:29;"Palo Alto into SF."
07:29;07:30;"Oh, yeah."
07:30;07:33;"I think there was like some kind of thing that sounded like decent, but kind of lame."
07:33;07:35;"Just like, well, a bunch of people are going to be at a bar."
07:35;07:38;"Those are so rough."
07:38;07:41;"I just feel like we're like, well, it's 9.30 PM."
07:41;07:42;"And we're just kind of like, should we do it?"
07:42;07:44;"And I was like, I'm kind of tired."
07:44;07:46;"And basically, we ended up going to sleep and sleeping through New Year's."
07:46;07:48;"And I remember waking up being like, that was the right call."
07:48;07:51;"I don't regret it at all."
07:51;07:54;"And I kind of feel like starting the year on the right note, rested."
07:54;07:59;"This past year, we were watching the film The Departed."
07:59;08:01;"Oh, that's a good movie."
08:01;08:04;"Looked at my phone and I was like, oh, it's like 12.06."
08:04;08:04;"Cool."
08:04;08:08;"Wait, wait, you mean like two weeks ago?"
08:08;08:10;"Yeah, we were with some other friends."
08:10;08:10;"Yeah."
08:10;08:15;"Jack Nicholson is like giving a monologue and you're just like, eh, nah."
08:15;08:17;"It's like John Lennon said, I'm an artist."
08:17;08:18;"Begin your tuba."
08:18;08:20;"I'll get you something out of it."
08:20;08:24;"It's like that really stressful moment when like Matt Damon's like sending a text in his"
08:24;08:26;"pocket and it's like, no, no, no, no."
08:26;08:38;"And you're just like, five, four, three, two, one."
08:38;08:49;"So anyway, I was looking forward to working."
08:49;08:50;"Right."
08:50;08:53;"But of course, the fires out there is a total nightmare."
08:53;08:59;"So and obviously, nobody could fault the festival for putting safety first when things are so"
08:59;08:59;"out of control."
08:59;09:02;"So, you know, of course, you didn't think twice about that part of it."
09:02;09:04;"But then it's kind of like, all right, so what are we doing?"
09:04;09:09;"And so we were just like in this hotel in Melbourne and people worked hard to like feel"
09:09;09:13;"like, well, where's the place where the whole band and crew can go and grab some pizza and"
09:13;09:13;"brews?"
09:13;09:17;"And they found like a cool rooftop bar where you could see the fireworks because they have"
09:17;09:22;"like fireworks that are like in the city set off of the top of buildings in like the downtown"
09:22;09:24;"central business district of Melbourne."
09:24;09:25;"Huh."
09:25;09:26;"But that seems dicey."
09:26;09:28;"I don't think they would let people do that in New York."
09:28;09:29;"What else about the fires?"
09:30;09:34;"Well, it was that was a topic of conversation because Melbourne, a lot of places have fireworks"
09:34;09:35;"in New Year's, right?"
09:35;09:39;"And Sydney actually is like the very famous ones, you know, down in the harbor by the"
09:39;09:39;"opera house."
09:39;09:44;"Sydney pops off for New Year's and you know, whatever, just being in Australia, naturally"
09:44;09:47;"talk to people and you see some of the national press and stuff."
09:47;09:51;"And there was a lot of like people were so mad at the prime minister, Scott Morrison."
09:51;09:52;"So people were like..."
09:52;09:53;"He was on like vacation somewhere."
09:53;09:54;"Yeah."
09:54;09:56;"There's a lot of things people were criticizing him about."
09:56;10:00;"And then there's this vibe of kind of like, and you're really going to do like the Sydney"
10:00;10:05;"fireworks when tens or hundreds of thousands of people are like fighting for their lives"
10:05;10:06;"or losing their homes."
10:06;10:08;"And people were just like, it's in bad taste."
10:08;10:10;"So full band and crew hangout?"
10:10;10:11;"Full band and crew hangout."
10:11;10:12;"Night off."
10:12;10:12;"That sounds kind of..."
10:12;10:13;"It's a night off."
10:13;10:14;"Sounds kind of fun."
10:14;10:15;"It's kind of fun."
10:15;10:19;"But then you also like know you have so much coming up and there's so much travel involved"
10:19;10:20;"in Australia that it's like..."
10:20;10:21;"Yeah."
10:21;10:26;"And also, I think because we knew why the festivals were canceled, you know, it's like"
10:26;10:29;"a weird energy in the air, I think."
10:29;10:29;"Yeah."
10:29;10:30;"Although, you know, you wouldn't..."
10:30;10:34;"It felt kind of like business as usual on the streets of Melbourne."
10:34;10:38;"When we finally came to play our own show in Melbourne, we had some technical issues."
10:38;10:42;"And the first couple of times the power went out, we had to like leave the stage."
10:42;10:46;"We're on like song three playing Cape Cod and the power goes out once."
10:46;10:48;"And then the crew is kind of like, you guys should walk off stage."
10:48;10:48;"We're going to take him in."
10:48;10:50;"We're like, all right, guys, we'll be right back."
10:50;10:50;"We're going to fix this."
10:50;10:52;"Was this indoors or outdoors?"
10:52;10:52;"Indoors."
10:52;10:54;"And then it happened again."
10:54;10:57;"And we walk off stage and like our crew is kind of like, listen, we got one last thing"
10:57;10:58;"we can try to make this work."
10:58;11:01;"And I was just standing there being like, if this show can't happen."
11:01;11:03;"And we had like these like hardcore fans there."
11:03;11:06;"And I was like, oh man, I was like, that's going to be a real bummer."
11:06;11:07;"But it worked out."
11:07;11:07;"It was a good show."
11:07;11:09;"The Sydney show was great too."
11:09;11:10;"Well, welcome home."
11:10;11:11;"Back to the grind."
11:11;11:13;"Back to that TC grind."
11:13;11:14;"Back to the TC grind, man."
11:14;11:17;"I feel good about 2020 though."
11:17;11:20;"Did you make any new year's resolutions or do you believe you're not allowed to say them?"
11:20;11:22;"No, I didn't make any resolutions."
11:22;11:23;"Did you?"
11:23;11:24;"No, I think this year I was like, you know what?"
11:24;11:27;"Just do all the things you're always putting off."
11:27;11:28;"Exercise, eat better."
11:28;11:29;"Oh yeah."
11:29;11:30;"I'm doing Dry January."
11:30;11:31;"Oh yeah."
11:31;11:35;"This is very unusual that I'm drinking a Modelo and you're not."
11:35;11:35;"That's true."
11:35;11:37;"Roll reversal."
11:37;11:41;"So yeah, Dry January, I feel like it's that and No Nut November."
11:41;11:45;"I feel like in the past five or six years, they've really become a thing."
11:45;11:50;"I feel like Dry January was like very trendy like two years ago."
11:50;11:56;"I've noticed among my peer group, a lot less enthusiasm around Dry January this year."
11:56;11:57;"What do you think that's about?"
11:57;11:59;"I think people are just like, eh, I don't want to."
11:59;12:00;"I think it's that simple."
12:00;12:03;"I noticed an uptick in tweets that were kind of like, you know,"
12:03;12:08;"forgetting about self-care and wellness and was kind of like 2020, we're doing drugs again."
12:08;12:10;"I feel like that was kind of like a viral tweet."
12:10;12:10;"Interesting."
12:10;12:13;"So maybe there is something that's like."
12:13;12:14;"Eff it."
12:14;12:15;"The world's on fire."
12:15;12:17;"Maybe this is kind of an eff it year."
12:17;12:22;"I also just feel like I can only speak for myself, but I feel like my adult life has been"
12:22;12:26;"watching the wellness health industry just like grow and grow."
12:26;12:30;"There are a couple of Whole Foods near the town I grew up in, in Jersey."
12:30;12:32;"There's like a couple in Montclair, New Jersey."
12:32;12:36;"And I was always kind of like, yeah, you know, it's like a slightly healthier supermarket."
12:36;12:39;"And I remember like when I got to college in the city,"
12:39;12:44;"it was right around when like some notable big Whole Foods opened in Manhattan."
12:44;12:46;"There was like the big one at Union."
12:46;12:47;"Yeah, there's the Union Square one."
12:47;12:51;"And there's also the big one at Columbus Circle in the Time Warner building."
12:51;12:55;"And I just kind of remember even at the time, and I remember people were just like, oh, sick."
12:55;12:56;"We've got an awesome hot bar."
12:56;12:58;"And I remember even at the time being like, wait, this is like suburban."
12:58;13:00;"People like hyped on this."
13:00;13:01;"Totally."
13:01;13:03;"But then I was kind of like, oh, it's the Whole Foods era."
13:03;13:05;"At the time, I didn't even, I didn't know any of the backstory."
13:05;13:08;"And then I just kind of feel like between that and like various"
13:08;13:14;"new ways of eating and the kind of like rise of healthy food startups that happen a lot."
13:14;13:16;"Like, yeah, we're like disrupting this or that."
13:16;13:19;"Here's the version that has ancient grains or whatever."
13:19;13:21;"I just feel like there's been more and more of that stuff."
13:21;13:24;"I feel like there's been some times that like really random airports and I just like walked"
13:24;13:28;"into the, you know, like the Hudson News equivalent where back in the day,"
13:28;13:33;"if you wanted to eat something like, quote unquote, healthy, just be like,"
13:33;13:36;"well, I'm not going to eat a f***ing Kit Kat right now."
13:36;13:41;"I guess I'll get the, uh, bag of peanuts, salted cashews, right?"
13:41;13:42;"And a diet Snapple."
13:42;13:46;"Oh, rough stuff."
13:46;13:46;"And now you go in there."
13:46;13:50;"I'm willing to believe this is still not healthy, but you would go into these places and it'd just"
13:50;13:56;"be like, well, we got six types of paleo bars, kale chips, you know, like you find that all"
13:56;13:56;"over the place."
13:56;13:58;"It's not a coastal thing at all."
13:58;13:59;"It's just very omnipresent."
14:00;14:05;"I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets, only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat."
14:05;14:06;"I'm from the old school."
14:06;14:08;"My household smell like soul food, bro."
14:08;14:15;"Curry falafel, barbecue tofu, no fish dough, no candy bars, no cigarettes, only ganja,"
14:15;14:19;"fresh squeezed juice from oranges, exercise and daily to stay healthy."
14:19;14:22;"And I rarely drink water out the tap because it's filthy."
14:22;14:28;"Lentil soup is mental fruit and ginger root is good for the youth."
14:28;14:32;"Fresh vegetable with them ice, hot stew, sweet and fries with the green."
14:32;14:37;"Kali, careful how you season and prepare your foods because you don't want to lose vitamins"
14:37;14:38;"and minerals."
14:38;14:40;"And that's the jewel."
14:40;14:41;"Life brings life is valuable."
14:41;14:43;"So I eat what comes from the ground."
14:43;14:44;"It's natural."
14:44;14:46;"Let your food be your medicine."
14:46;14:47;"No, etc."
14:47;14:52;"Strictly herb generation, the sun, because I got melanin and drink water, eight glasses"
14:52;14:52;"a day."
14:52;14:54;"That's what they say."
14:55;14:58;"They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy."
14:58;15:01;"My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy."
15:01;15:04;"But true wealth comes from good health and wise ways."
15:04;15:06;"We got to start taking better care of ourselves."
15:06;15:10;"They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy."
15:10;15:12;"My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy."
15:12;15:15;"But true wealth comes from good health and wise ways."
15:15;15:18;"We got to start taking better care of ourselves."
15:18;15:19;"Be healthy, y'all."
15:19;15:23;"I feel like there is kind of a turn to just being like, let me get a Big Mac."
15:23;15:26;"And maybe it also has to do with the global mood."
15:26;15:27;"Right."
15:27;15:27;"Climate change."
15:27;15:29;"There's a lot of reasons to feel pessimistic."
15:29;15:33;"But I also have a feeling that there's probably a lot of people who five to six years ago were"
15:33;15:39;"like, holy shit, they just opened a new kind of lunch place in my town and you can get"
15:39;15:40;"like a quinoa ball."
15:40;15:44;"And yeah, finally, I don't have to go eat Angela's sub shop for lunch anymore."
15:44;15:48;"And then I have a feeling like probably like five years on, people are just like, do I"
15:48;15:49;"feel any better?"
15:49;15:50;"I don't know."
15:50;15:50;"Right."
15:50;15:51;"Do I?"
15:51;15:52;"Am I any healthier?"
15:52;15:55;"And by the way, I'm not advocating that people don't eat healthy at all."
15:55;15:59;"I just have a feeling that a lot of what was sold to people as a healthier lifestyle, some"
15:59;16:05;"of which was probably real and some of which was kind of branded disruption nonsense."
16:05;16:10;"I just feel like what that all adds up to is probably a decent number of people feeling"
16:10;16:15;"a little burned out and being like, man, I remember that moment when, yeah, the new lunch"
16:15;16:21;"spot opened or when I started placing my Amazon order to get these, you know, special like"
16:22;16:26;"hemp fig bars that were like, I was going to eat them instead of butterfingers for my"
16:26;16:27;"snacks and blah."
16:27;16:32;"And I just feel like there's like a lot of, maybe I'm partially this person, but I just"
16:32;16:34;"feel like there's probably like a bit of exhaustion."
16:34;16:37;"That's just like, well, you know what, man, the revolution didn't come."
16:37;16:43;"I mean, I think I got all my pollen on it, but it's like, or pollen, but it's like, if"
16:43;16:48;"you're just eating the processed vegan version of like hamburgers and candy bars, you're"
16:48;16:49;"going to feel the same."
16:49;16:53;"You have to actually eat like raw vegetables."
16:53;16:53;"Yeah."
16:53;16:55;"I know it's a bummer."
16:55;16:59;"It's not, that's not a fun hang, like just eating like carrots."
16:59;17:00;"And you also just got to exercise."
17:00;17:03;"I guess I went to the gym for the first time in a long time today."
17:03;17:04;"How'd it feel?"
17:04;17:06;"I feel a little better."
17:06;17:08;"I said to the dude I work out with, I was like, you know what, man?"
17:08;17:11;"Cause he always says like, it's always embarrassing."
17:11;17:11;"Cause what are your goals?"
17:11;17:12;"What are your goals?"
17:12;17:15;"Well, he also said he's known me for a long time and he's seen me very little the past"
17:15;17:16;"year."
17:16;17:18;"So it will always be like, how's it been going on the road?"
17:19;17:19;"Like workout wise."
17:19;17:20;"Yeah."
17:20;17:26;"Like you've been working out and sometimes, you know, I mean, I hit the hotel gym, um,"
17:26;17:29;"that time that I'm thinking like, what did I actually do when I was in there?"
17:29;17:33;"Listen to seven minutes of a podcast and like run a sprint."
17:33;17:35;"And so I said to him, I was like, you know what, man?"
17:35;17:38;"And maybe this is a little bit of that come to Jesus moment."
17:38;17:42;"And also just because I legitimately have felt less healthy being on the road for six"
17:42;17:42;"months."
17:42;17:43;"Sure."
17:43;17:44;"I think it's finally taken a toll on me."
17:44;17:46;"There's the last couple of tours."
17:46;17:50;"I was kind of just like, and especially touring Australia, it's a very healthy country, but"
17:50;17:51;"not for touring musician."
17:51;17:55;"Cause you're just spending a lot of time in the airport lounges, just snacking."
17:55;17:58;"You're not out there like rock climbing like a real Aussie."
17:58;18:02;"But anyway, so I was, you know, I said, you know what man, I'm starting at zero."
18:02;18:03;"I don't feel good."
18:03;18:05;"I don't feel terrible either."
18:05;18:07;"I was like, yeah, I mean like you didn't put on weight or anything."
18:07;18:08;"I don't know."
18:08;18:09;"I haven't actually gone on the scale in a while."
18:09;18:15;"I saw a picture that I was tagged in on Instagram from, must've been about a year ago."
18:15;18:19;"It was when I sat down with Will Welch from GQ to do an interview and I'm wearing an eight"
18:19;18:20;"minute Cape Cod long sleeve."
18:20;18:21;"Oh, I saw that."
18:21;18:21;"And I saw the picture."
18:21;18:24;"It might've been my, I don't know if it was like the way I had my arms crossed."
18:24;18:27;"I just looked at myself and I was like, I look healthier."
18:27;18:30;"I showed it to Rishi and she's like, you look exactly the same, but you know what?"
18:30;18:34;"It's not even about like, um, being obsessed with the way you look."
18:34;18:35;"I just had this thing."
18:35;18:37;"I looked at myself and I was just like, I don't know what I was looking at."
18:37;18:39;"I don't know if it was a sparkle in my eye."
18:39;18:43;"I could see something personal where I was like, whatever's happening on the outside."
18:43;18:48;"I could see something in that photo that was like, there was more of a spark of life in me."
18:48;18:49;"I think you're projecting man."
18:49;18:50;"But you know how it is."
18:50;18:51;"It's like, you can,"
18:51;18:52;"Well, photos are crazy too."
18:52;18:56;"You can look crazy different in photos from like the same day."
18:56;18:58;"Just like, right."
18:58;19:02;"Like the one 500th of a second that happened to capture you then."
19:02;19:02;"Oh yeah, of course."
19:02;19:03;"But I mean, it's like,"
19:03;19:05;"But the spark of life is a real thing."
19:05;19:09;"I mean, just cause your brain chemistry changes when you exercise a little bit."
19:09;19:09;"Well, I don't know."
19:09;19:11;"Actually, I'm curious about this."
19:11;19:13;"You know, the 2020, let's go."
19:13;19:15;"I mean, I'm pro exercise."
19:15;19:16;"Let's go open kimono."
19:16;19:18;"Let's crack open those books."
19:18;19:21;"Starting 2020 on a like back on the time crisis, health and fitness tip."
19:21;19:24;"We're going against the grain."
19:24;19:26;"The people have spoken, and this is a year of drugs and alcohol,"
19:26;19:29;"but that time crisis, we're actually getting back into health and fitness."
19:29;19:33;"We're contrarians here, but this is going to be a wild year."
19:33;19:37;"Whether you're choosing to go the path of drugs and alcohol or the path of"
19:37;19:38;"Enlightenment."
19:38;19:40;"Enlightenment, health and fitness."
19:41;19:41;"Health."
19:41;19:44;"Either way, it's going to be a wild year because it's an election year."
19:44;19:48;"You know, we've, at time crisis, I think, I know."
19:48;19:48;"It's funny though, you know,"
19:48;19:50;"A short 11 months away."
19:50;19:53;"I think the true TC heads, they know that to some extent,"
19:53;19:59;"even though maybe the most classic stretches of TC existed not in election years,"
19:59;20:06;"to some extent, the TC sensibility was forged in the fires of 2016."
20:06;20:07;"Just because that was like the early days."
20:07;20:08;"Yeah."
20:08;20:13;"I think we made a conscious choice to not, especially given our infamous lag on covering"
20:13;20:18;"the news of the day that we're not going to just come in and just be like,"
20:18;20:19;"you know, President Trump."
20:19;20:21;"You see this about Trump?"
20:21;20:21;"Yeah."
20:21;20:25;"But we have been up to our ears in Trump era EDM."
20:25;20:25;"It's funny."
20:25;20:27;"Trump era EDM has kind of like fallen off."
20:27;20:32;"I think maybe at the, hopefully next January when Bernie's sworn in,"
20:32;20:36;"we can do a look back on the four years of Trump era music and look at how it changed."
20:36;20:40;"Well, if Sanders wins, hopefully we'll get into some of that Vermont kind of crunchy."
20:40;20:42;"That's one thing I want to say."
20:42;20:43;"I've been thinking about this."
20:43;20:47;"The only candidate who's been out there talking about the fact that he listens to fish"
20:47;20:50;"is unfortunately Mayor Pete."
20:50;20:51;"Oh, really?"
20:51;20:52;"He's a fish guy?"
20:52;20:53;"Yes."
20:53;20:57;"And I think he even like, maybe he made some joke about like fish performing at the inauguration,"
20:57;20:58;"but this is also important."
20:58;20:59;"That would be tight."
20:59;21:01;"Of course it would be tight."
21:01;21:04;"But if Sanders won, true OG Vermont."
21:04;21:05;"Yeah."
21:05;21:06;"Credibility there."
21:06;21:09;"And I don't know if, I don't know if anybody from fish has endorsed anybody"
21:09;21:12;"and I wouldn't want to put them on the spot, but I just feel like that's like a classic"
21:12;21:19;"situation where it's like the hardcore fan is not always indicative of like the larger community."
21:19;21:20;"Sure."
21:20;21:23;"So anyway, I just want to say, well, so, okay."
21:23;21:25;"You know, so Mayor Pete's been to some fish shows."
21:25;21:30;"In 2016 fish, or at least John Fishman endorsed him."
21:30;21:30;"Bernie."
21:30;21:31;"Yeah."
21:31;21:33;"And Fishman was one of several people."
21:33;21:34;"This is in 2016."
21:34;21:38;"Fishman was one of several people Sanders thanked at the top of his stump speech in"
21:38;21:39;"Portland."
21:39;21:42;"He called fish one of the great bands in the country."
21:42;21:42;"Sick."
21:42;21:47;"And he said, let me thank one of Vermont's heroes who has now transplanted John Fishman."
21:47;21:49;"John and fish have made new England proud."
21:49;21:53;"They are one of the great bands have been one of the great bands in the country."
21:53;21:53;"Okay."
21:53;21:56;"So there, yeah, of course there's a fish Bernie connection."
21:56;21:59;"I think the thing with Bernie is we know very little about his taste in pop culture because"
21:59;22:02;"he has no time for that type of job owning."
22:02;22:07;"Every time he does an interview and people try to take it to that place of being like,"
22:07;22:08;"yo, but you know what?"
22:08;22:09;"Give us some like fun color."
22:09;22:11;"He's just like, you know what?"
22:11;22:12;"Here's what I think."
22:12;22:13;"Yeah."
22:13;22:14;"The American people."
22:14;22:16;"Bernie, what'd you think of a season two of the wire?"
22:16;22:18;"Didn't have time."
22:18;22:18;"Yeah."
22:18;22:23;"Also just John Fishman partially credits Bernie Sanders with fish formation."
22:23;22:24;"Wait, what?"
22:24;22:24;"Okay."
22:24;22:25;"Let's hear about this."
22:25;22:26;"Let's hear about this."
22:26;22:27;"This is at a rally."
22:27;22:31;"2016 John Fishman spoke the sick must be same main rally."
22:31;22:34;"In the very beginning, this is fishman in the very beginning of our band."
22:34;22:37;"We grew up in the environment that Bernie Sanders was largely responsible for."
22:37;22:39;"Very vibrant, healthy community."
22:39;22:41;"And he supported the arts tremendously."
22:41;22:46;"And, uh, and we, as a band, it could be said that we may not have existed."
22:46;22:47;"How we not grown up in a place."
22:47;22:52;"I mean, it's a little loose, but not growing up in a place where the art scene was so vibrant"
22:52;22:57;"that we were able to play five, six nights a week up and down main street at a whole"
22:57;22:58;"number of venues."
22:58;22:59;"Tied by it."
22:59;23:03;"I do remember reading a Bernie's book back."
23:03;23:04;"Actually, I remember it's on the same Hawaii trip."
23:04;23:05;"Right."
23:05;23:06;"I remember you had that."
23:06;23:07;"I remember I was just like burning through that Bernie book."
23:07;23:09;"It was from the nineties, right?"
23:09;23:10;"That book was an oldie."
23:10;23:11;"It was from the nineties."
23:11;23:15;"And then they kind of updated it to have a little bit about his presidential campaign."
23:15;23:19;"But it really, it was, it was, I think it was off the back of like, how did this independent"
23:19;23:20;"dude end up in the house?"
23:20;23:21;"Yeah."
23:21;23:23;"And it was, so he told kind of the story of his life."
23:23;23:28;"But again, as you can imagine with Bernie, not like a ton of color,"
23:28;23:30;"you know, stuff about his family, not that different than things you've probably heard"
23:30;23:31;"in his stump speech."
23:31;23:31;"Yeah."
23:31;23:35;"My parents were working people and my father's family was wiped out in the Holocaust."
23:35;23:37;"Cause I heard about a guy called Hitler."
23:37;23:39;"He keeps it simple and straightforward."
23:39;23:40;"No history on it."
23:40;23:41;"Yeah."
23:41;23:46;"One day my dad took me and he said, Bernie, I want to tell you a story."
23:46;23:46;"Yeah."
23:46;23:50;"You can picture the way other candidates would have like the story of like your working class"
23:50;23:52;"father, whose family was wiped out in the Holocaust."
23:52;23:54;"And yeah, you'd like be working on it with your strategist."
23:54;23:58;"Just be like, so do you remember the first time your parent told you that story?"
23:58;23:58;"And they're like, I don't know."
23:58;24:00;"I mean, I grew up, it was part of our family history."
24:00;24:02;"And it's like, okay, but like paint a picture for me."
24:02;24:03;"It's like, let me tell you a story."
24:03;24:08;"When I was a kid in Brooklyn, my dad invited me in to his working class place of business."
24:08;24:11;"It was noisy, smelled bad."
24:11;24:14;"And he said, Bernie, I got to tell you something, you know, like just really funny."
24:14;24:14;"I'm going to have a set."
24:14;24:17;"It's all, I'm sure somebody could find an example of him doing something close to that."
24:17;24:20;"But generally speaking, it's just always like my parents were working people."
24:20;24:22;"Father's family was wiped out by Hitler."
24:22;24:24;"I think I know a thing or two, you know, like, that's the vibe."
24:24;24:28;"But anyway, Bernie has no time for like the fun stuff."
24:28;24:31;"So there's not a ton of talk about the type of music he likes."
24:31;24:35;"But I remember in the book, there was a significant amount of ink spilled,"
24:35;24:40;"not about specific stuff, but just his pride as mayor in terms of like local events"
24:40;24:45;"and how they had, I don't know, like drama festivals and poetry."
24:45;24:48;"I remember this one part where he's like, even Allen Ginsberg came up to Burlington for a"
24:48;24:50;"event that the town put on."
24:50;24:51;"So, you know, that fits Bernie."
24:51;24:54;"Like he's definitely not a type of dude who'd be like dropping his top 10 list"
24:54;24:57;"at the end of the year."
24:57;24:57;"Oh my God."
24:57;24:59;"That's so funny."
24:59;25:02;"Now, of course he must've listened to Phish just to some extent."
25:02;25:04;"At the very least, he must've heard some performance."
25:04;25:06;"Maybe if he gave a stump speech somewhere."
25:06;25:07;"I'm sure he's seen them."
25:07;25:08;"Yeah, I'm sure he's probably seen them."
25:08;25:09;"Yeah."
25:09;25:11;"They're playing like a park in Burlington in the summer."
25:11;25:12;"Yeah, something like that."
25:12;25:13;"But here's the thing."
25:13;25:18;"I'm speaking to the Jam Band nation, the Jam Band community, jambands.com."
25:18;25:19;"Jambands.com."
25:19;25:20;"Relics."
25:20;25:26;"If anybody from the Jam Band community is still on the fence about Bernie or Mayor Pete,"
25:26;25:30;"which I kind of doubt, but let's say if anybody's still on the fence and you're thinking,"
25:30;25:31;"you know what?"
25:31;25:34;"Bernie and Mayor Pete have both shouted out Phish."
25:34;25:36;"And you know, Pete's a little closer in age to me."
25:36;25:37;"I don't know."
25:37;25:38;"And then whatever."
25:38;25:42;"Be like, okay, but Mayor Pete has not said a damn word about Twiddle."
25:42;25:45;"And we know for a fact that Bernie's seen Twiddle because..."
25:45;25:46;"I'd like to thank Twiddle."
25:46;25:47;"Thank you, Twiddle."
25:47;25:49;"Mayor Pete's never heard of Twiddle."
25:49;25:51;"Have you heard of the Jam Flow Man's jam?"
25:51;25:53;"Sickest and the quickest, hangs in the lane."
25:53;25:55;"Got that shish down real nice."
25:55;25:57;"He'll play his jam and it won't be twice."
25:57;26:00;"No, the Jam Flow Man don't give a damn."
26:00;26:02;"Playing shows across the lane."
26:02;26:04;"Rocking out with his band."
26:04;26:06;"Playing a fat old reggae jam."
26:06;26:08;"No, the Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
26:08;26:10;"Make my body move all around."
26:10;26:12;"Twist it up and blaze it down."
26:12;26:15;"Pass it back and forth, spin it round and round."
26:15;26:17;"Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
26:17;26:19;"Make my body move all around."
26:19;26:21;"Twist it up and blaze it down."
26:21;26:24;"Pass it back and forth, spin it round and round."
26:24;26:30;"Didn't we look on that YouTube comments thread to see if there were any weird Trump dudes?"
26:30;26:31;"That sounds familiar."
26:31;26:33;"We couldn't tell if there was trolling or..."
26:33;26:36;"Yeah, this sounds familiar."
26:36;26:36;"This sounds familiar."
26:36;26:42;"There's 100% gotta be some deadheads who are hardcore capitalist right-wingers."
26:42;26:44;"You know who's in is Ann Coulter."
26:44;26:45;"She's a deadhead?"
26:45;26:46;"She's a deadhead."
26:46;26:46;"No."
26:49;26:52;"Ann Coulter, I'm a Grateful Dead fan for life."
26:52;26:56;"The conservative political author estimates she saw the band 67 times"
26:56;26:59;"and still listens to her 50 live tapes."
26:59;27:02;"Loads of deadheads are libertarians and not just for the drug laws."
27:02;27:06;"That's when the definition of libertarian just gets so out of control where it's like,"
27:06;27:10;"""Yeah, man, libertarians, I believe people should have a lot of freedom, like tight."""
27:10;27:11;"But then you support all this like..."
27:11;27:15;"She's like hardcore anti-immigration, hardcore..."
27:15;27:18;"She explains there was a faction of deadheads within her community growing up."
27:18;27:20;"Contrary to some people's image of the dead,"
27:20;27:24;"they were huge in my very affluent wasp hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut."
27:24;27:25;"Oh, Jesus."
27:25;27:28;"Another dark stain on CT."
27:28;27:35;"I mean, we gained a little ground with the discovery of Goose."
27:35;27:36;"Yeah."
27:36;27:39;"Feeling pretty good about the CT vibes."
27:39;27:41;"Did she say my waspy community in Connecticut?"
27:41;27:44;"My very affluent wasp hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut."
27:44;27:46;"My very affluent..."
27:46;27:50;"She said there was a faction in favor of making Truckin our prom song."
27:50;27:51;"Okay, first of all, it's a little basic."
27:51;27:53;"Prom?"
27:53;27:56;"What year was this?"
27:56;27:56;"Wow."
27:56;27:58;"I guess it must've been like the 70s."
27:58;27:59;"This is so rough."
27:59;28:04;"I can never pick a favorite song just as I can't pick a favorite Scalia to send."
28:04;28:05;"Oh my God."
28:05;28:09;"But among the ones I love are Tennessee Jed, Althea, Taste."
28:09;28:09;"Okay."
28:09;28:11;"I mean, they're not Bobby songs."
28:11;28:11;"Taste."
28:13;28:16;"They're like classic mid-tempo Jerry numbers."
28:16;28:18;"Stagger Lee."
28:18;28:19;"I mean, yeah."
28:19;28:20;"Eyes of the World."
28:20;28:21;"Loose Lucy."
28:21;28:22;"I mean, all right."
28:22;28:22;"That's rough."
28:22;28:25;"You would categorize Loose Lucy as rough stuff."
28:25;28:25;"That's rough."
28:25;28:27;"Rough stuff."
28:27;28:28;"Franklin's Tower."
28:28;28:29;"Deal."
28:29;28:30;"Sugar Magnolia."
28:30;28:30;"Unbroken."
28:30;28:31;"I mean, she's picking classics."
28:31;28:31;"I mean, yeah."
28:31;28:33;"She understands the dead clearly."
28:33;28:37;"But the dead have that component."
28:37;28:37;"Oh, wait."
28:37;28:41;"I mostly followed them as a practicing lawyer from 1991 to August '95."
28:41;28:43;"I wonder if she was at the last show."
28:43;28:44;"Wow."
28:44;28:45;"Time Crisis."
28:45;28:52;"This week, Ann Coulter calls in to discuss being at the historic last show in Chicago."
28:52;28:55;"We don't see eye to eye on a lot of stuff, but we're not here to talk politics."
28:55;28:55;"Yeah."
28:55;28:58;"So tell us, Tennessee Jed, that's your favorite song."
28:58;28:59;"Do you have a favorite from--"
28:59;29:01;"What are your top five Tennessee Jets?"
29:01;29:05;"It breaks my heart that the band never played Pride of Cucamonga in concert."
29:05;29:09;"That would have been as big a story as Brexit and probably would have rocked the stock market"
29:09;29:10;"just as much."
29:10;29:11;"Oh my God."
29:11;29:11;"Shut up."
29:12;29:15;"So she's referencing obscure Phil songs."
29:15;29:17;"Good for you, Ann."
29:17;29:19;"By the way, Phil is a Bernie donor."
29:19;29:19;"Oh, is he?"
29:19;29:20;"I looked it up."
29:20;29:20;"Yeah."
29:20;29:21;"That's tight."
29:21;29:25;"I had a day the other day where I was just like, you can look up people's donations."
29:25;29:26;"How do you do that?"
29:26;29:28;"You can look it up on the SEC."
29:28;29:30;"It's pretty wild, actually."
29:30;29:34;"And I do want to caution people if you get into this, before you go through it judging"
29:34;29:37;"people too harshly because you're like, oh, they didn't donate to the person I like."
29:37;29:40;"I looked at my own and it's missing a bunch of stuff."
29:40;29:42;"Actually, I looked you up, Jake."
29:42;29:42;"Yeah?"
29:42;29:43;"Strong choices."
29:43;29:44;"Really?"
29:44;29:45;"Actually, I should look this up right now."
29:45;29:49;"Speaking of Mayor Pete, I gave money to him early on."
29:49;29:50;"Oh, really?"
29:50;29:57;"When he first emerged, I don't know, I guess it was early 2019."
29:57;29:57;"Yeah."
29:57;29:59;"And he was just like, yeah, I want to stack the court."
29:59;30:01;"I want to try to get rid of the electoral college."
30:01;30:02;"I was like, this is cool."
30:02;30:03;"Who's this young dude?"
30:03;30:03;"Yeah."
30:03;30:07;"And I remember watching this CNN town hall with him and he was talking about his relationship"
30:07;30:11;"to religion and being from Indiana and his relationship with Mike Pence."
30:11;30:12;"And I was like, this is a cool dude."
30:12;30:13;"Yeah."
30:13;30:16;"So I kicked him some dough for like, you know, I did like a monthly thing for a while."
30:16;30:16;"Yeah."
30:16;30:19;"And then at some point I switched over to Bernie."
30:19;30:19;"Back to Bernie."
30:19;30:20;"Back to Bernie."
30:20;30:22;"I think a lot of people are back to Bernie."
30:22;30:22;"Yeah."
30:22;30:24;"It's been a journey, but-"
30:24;30:25;"Wait, so look me up."
30:25;30:30;"So the funny thing is about this, because I looked up my own and it had three donations"
30:30;30:32;"I made to Bernie in 2016."
30:32;30:36;"And it was missing like all of my donations in this election."
30:36;30:38;"Is this through ActBlue that you're doing that?"
30:38;30:39;"Yes."
30:39;30:40;"That might be part of it."
30:40;30:41;"It's because it's through ActBlue."
30:41;30:41;"Right."
30:41;30:44;"Jake Longstreth, you went big in 2016."
30:44;30:48;"You gave him a $1,600 donation."
30:48;30:49;"You know what that was?"
30:49;30:49;"What?"
30:49;30:51;"A Richard Pictures fundraiser at El Cid."
30:51;30:53;"Ah, wow."
30:53;30:54;"Yep."
30:54;30:54;"Adds up."
30:54;30:59;"But you also made some other ones at 250 and, oh, 250 in this election cycle."
30:59;31:00;"So yeah, you're putting your money where your mouth is, man."
31:00;31:01;"I'm in."
31:01;31:04;"Jake Longstreth, occupation artist."
31:04;31:06;"That's so funny that that's there."
31:06;31:07;"It's weird."
31:07;31:08;"But so I was like, kind of like going wild on this."
31:08;31:10;"Cause I was just like, whoa, who can you look up?"
31:10;31:12;"So I was like, Phil Lush."
31:12;31:14;"I looked up Jerry Garcia, nothing came up."
31:14;31:16;"Cause sometimes it goes back to like the 80s."
31:16;31:16;"Wow."
31:16;31:18;"Jerry Garcia, Richard Nixon."
31:18;31:21;"What?"
31:21;31:21;"Man."
31:21;31:25;"You know, I liked what he was doing with China, man."
31:25;31:26;"He's opening that place up."
31:26;31:27;"Needed to happen."
31:27;31:28;"He formed the EPA."
31:28;31:30;"It's not so bad a guy."
31:30;31:31;"He's a California boy, man."
31:31;31:32;"What can I say?"
31:32;31:34;"Working class California guy, just like me."
31:34;31:38;"So Phil, yeah, he's been getting, he gave money to Barbara Boxer,"
31:39;31:45;"Betty Sue Sutton, moveon.org, gave John Kerry in 2004."
31:45;31:48;"On the one hand, I'm like, this stuff needs to be out there."
31:48;31:50;"What's the max you can give?"
31:50;31:54;"In one campaign, one election cycle, the max you can give to an individual candidate is $2,800."
31:54;31:55;"2,800."
31:55;31:56;"Okay."
31:56;31:57;"That's so funny."
31:57;31:58;"But I think also the thing is like,"
31:58;32:00;"Why are they limit the individual?"
32:00;32:04;"It's like, well, there's all these workarounds or those, all those packs and."
32:04;32:05;"Well, yeah, I think,"
32:05;32:06;"It's so stupid."
32:06;32:07;"They should limit all of it."
32:07;32:07;"Yeah."
32:07;32:10;"I think there's a lot of candidates too, because like you get those,"
32:10;32:13;"as we've talked about, you incessantly get those emails."
32:13;32:17;"And so I think there's so many candidates who are like, I've gave, you know, I'm like,"
32:17;32:18;"all right, what's up with this person?"
32:18;32:19;"Like here's 50."
32:19;32:20;"And then you get like another email."
32:20;32:26;"It's like, for the love of God, if each one of you gave me $14 right now, I could live just like,"
32:26;32:28;"so I feel like I've given a lot of small donations."
32:28;32:30;"That's not going to show up on something like this."
32:30;32:31;"Is there somebody you can think of?"
32:31;32:35;"I'm trying to think of someone more interesting than just like movie stars."
32:35;32:35;"Right."
32:35;32:37;"Wait, should we try Bob Weir?"
32:38;32:38;"Yeah."
32:38;32:39;"Let's see."
32:39;32:42;"Robert Weir, San Rafael, California."
32:42;32:42;"That's him."
32:42;32:44;"Occupation Grateful Dead."
32:44;32:44;"That's so tight."
32:44;32:46;"This is amazing."
32:46;32:48;"Date 5/15/92."
32:48;32:52;"$1,000 to Harold K Lonsdale, independent."
32:52;32:52;"Interesting."
32:52;32:53;"Maybe local election."
32:53;32:54;"I'm not familiar."
32:54;32:57;"Then in 2004, he gave 250 to John Kerry."
32:57;33:00;"2008 gave some money to Barack Obama."
33:00;33:03;"Gave some money to Dan Hamburg."
33:03;33:05;"You know, he's given a lot of money to the DNC."
33:06;33:08;"Just generally to the DNC."
33:08;33:10;"Who's got like a really unique name?"
33:10;33:12;"Cardi B."
33:12;33:14;"Wait, what's Cardi B's real name?"
33:14;33:15;"It is very unique."
33:15;33:17;"It's Bel Callis."
33:17;33:21;"Again, I'm not going to take any of this as gospel."
33:21;33:24;"And I know this probably seems a little bit like dicey."
33:24;33:26;"I'm very pro privacy."
33:26;33:29;"But I do think with politics, it's like, come on, money in politics."
33:29;33:31;"There's a reason it needs to be open."
33:31;33:33;"Robert Zimmerman."
33:33;33:35;"Oh, there's going to be so many people named."
33:35;33:36;"You think so?"
33:36;33:36;"Yeah."
33:36;33:39;"Is Zimmerman like a really common name?"
33:39;33:40;"Yeah."
33:40;33:40;"Huh."
33:40;33:40;"All right."
33:40;33:42;"We can think of somebody good."
33:42;33:44;"I want to search Steve Miller, but it's going to be impossible to."
33:44;33:46;"Oh, yeah."
33:46;33:49;"You know, one thing I'll say about this, because, you know, to reiterate,"
33:49;33:53;"there's very few times I take pleasure in just like finding information about people."
33:53;33:55;"There's something very hackery about it."
33:55;33:57;"You know, I think people deserve their privacy."
33:57;34:01;"But I will say that more people should know that this stuff is public because"
34:01;34:04;"it kind of encourages, I think, celebrities."
34:04;34:09;"And look, I think when a lot of celebrities, people get, especially out here in Hollywood,"
34:09;34:12;"people get invited to like dinners and somebody is like,"
34:12;34:14;"yo, we got this great person who's running for Senate."
34:14;34:17;"And you go and you hear them talk and you're just like, you probably haven't"
34:17;34:18;"like read every little thing about them."
34:18;34:20;"You met them in person or something."
34:20;34:23;"And you're just kind of like, all right, yeah, I'll max out for your campaign."
34:23;34:25;"Or you or you just know that they're the Democrat."
34:25;34:30;"Obviously, people look at senatorial races and presidential races pretty differently."
34:30;34:30;"Yeah."
34:30;34:32;"Like our friend Beto."
34:32;34:35;"I was throwing money at the Senate race, not the presidential race."
34:35;34:39;"But I do think if more rich people and celebrities and, you know,"
34:39;34:42;"even people who aren't richer celebrities, just people who just at least have enough"
34:42;34:46;"money that they can give at this amount, which, of course, not everybody can."
34:46;34:49;"But if you think of it as being like this a lifetime record,"
34:49;34:53;"you'd be like, you know, yeah, don't be stingy."
34:53;34:57;"Like because maybe in 15 years, you know, some guys on internet radio,"
34:57;35:00;"she'll be looking back at your past 30 years of contribution."
35:00;35:02;"And what kind of names are we going to see there?"
35:02;35:03;"What kind of giving?"
35:03;35:05;"And obviously, people give money to charities."
35:05;35:08;"I can understand why people are somewhat alienated by electoral politics."
35:08;35:09;"Yeah."
35:09;35:12;"But I just, you know, I feel like even though he didn't come up,"
35:12;35:17;"wouldn't be tight if you're just like Jerry Garcia, like Ralph Nate, just like"
35:17;35:19;"all like the tight people."
35:19;35:20;"Jerry Brown."
35:20;35:26;"Imagine if it was like Jerry Garcia and it was just like Bernie Sanders mayoral campaign 1980."
35:26;35:28;"Jerry was tapped in."
35:28;35:31;"Seventy two dollars."
35:31;35:33;"That was a lot of money back then, man."
35:33;35:36;"Handwritten check mailing that across the country."
35:36;35:36;"Yeah."
35:36;35:41;"OK, hold on just before we give up on this with any."
35:41;35:43;"Oh, wait, I feel like that's a fun."
35:43;35:44;"I think this is a fun game."
35:44;35:45;"It is a fun game."
35:45;35:48;"I think one that I radio just like Quentin Tarantino."
35:48;35:49;"Oh, that's a tight call."
35:49;35:50;"No one."
35:50;35:55;"No, he gave in 2011, he gave two and twenty five hundred dollars to Barack Obama."
35:55;35:59;"And in 2011, he also gave thirty thousand dollars to the DNC."
35:59;35:59;"Wow."
35:59;36:01;"Look at you, Quentin."
36:01;36:02;"Stepping it up."
36:02;36:04;"But not in 2016."
36:04;36:05;"Interesting."
36:05;36:06;"Well, see, that's where this is."
36:06;36:10;"So, no, no, but that's that's where I don't feel like confident enough in the information to be"
36:10;36:15;"like, Quentin, because I'm just like, but I had my Bernie donations from 2016."
36:15;36:16;"Let me look mine up again."
36:16;36:17;"It must be this act blue thing."
36:17;36:22;"But I was just like, but I think I did the Bernie thing through none of my 2019"
36:22;36:23;"contributions come up on this one."
36:24;36:27;"I'm not confident enough to say that omissions."
36:27;36:28;"Yeah, yeah."
36:28;36:31;"Mean that somebody like straight up fell off like that just seems like such like a classic,"
36:31;36:35;"like clickbait trash article that you could just imagine on like some like dog website."
36:35;36:39;"Somebody's like reading through the celebrities giving history."
36:39;36:43;"And it's like Quentin Tarantino felt a little generous in 2011, but in the nine years since,"
36:43;36:45;"absolutely nothing."
36:45;36:48;"And just like they're just literally just look at the same website that we're looking at."
36:48;36:50;"Not doing any further research."
36:50;36:53;"I guess when he was working on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"
36:53;36:55;"Quinn got a little disengaged from modern politics."
36:55;36:58;"For all we know, he's like splashing it out."
36:58;36:59;"Who knows?"
37:00;37:01;"Red and white."
37:01;37:04;"Blue suede shoes."
37:04;37:08;"I'm Uncle Sam."
37:08;37:10;"How do you do?"
37:10;37:14;"Give me five."
37:14;37:17;"I'm still alive."
37:17;37:21;"Ain't no luck."
37:21;37:24;"I learned to duck."
37:24;37:26;"Check my pulse."
37:26;37:30;"It don't change."
37:30;37:33;"Stay 72."
37:33;37:37;"Come shine or rain."
37:37;37:40;"Wave the flag."
37:40;37:44;"Pop the bag."
37:44;37:47;"Park the boat."
37:47;37:50;"Skin the goat."
37:52;37:54;"Skin the goat."
37:54;38:05;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
38:05;38:09;"So on a fairly recent episode, we were talking about Jet a bunch."
38:09;38:10;"And by the way, Jake, you got a little hot water."
38:10;38:13;"I think we got an email from somebody who implied an Australian who thought that you"
38:13;38:15;"dissed AC/DC."
38:15;38:16;"I did."
38:16;38:17;"Oh, you did?"
38:17;38:19;"I thought I was taking out of context."
38:19;38:20;"You got to respect them."
38:20;38:20;"Well, sure."
38:21;38:22;"Did I diss them?"
38:22;38:23;"I don't know."
38:23;38:25;"I just was like, ""This sounds like AC/DC."
38:25;38:28;"I don't like, you know, I just, I don't, I don't like AC/DC."""
38:28;38:31;"You just straight up don't like AC/DC."
38:31;38:34;"I like shook me all night long."
38:34;38:35;"That's a great song."
38:35;38:36;"And that's it."
38:36;38:38;"You don't like, like Back in Black?"
38:38;38:38;"No."
38:38;38:41;"I don't know what, I just like, they don't do it for me, man."
38:41;38:46;"Anyway, so we were talking about Jet and I was really sticking up for Jet."
38:46;38:47;"I think we both were a little bit."
38:47;38:48;"Sure."
38:48;38:53;"I can't remember if we fantasized this or if this was real that the dude from Tame Impala,"
38:53;38:57;"he was doing an interview and somebody was kind of saying how you're a very cool Australian band"
38:57;38:58;"as opposed to Jet."
38:58;39:01;"And he actually like put the journalist in their place."
39:01;39:02;"This is full TC fantasy."
39:02;39:08;"Anyway, but we referenced on that episode, an infamous Pitchfork review,"
39:08;39:14;"which I believe was a score of 0.0 awarded to Jet for their second album."
39:14;39:16;"And they just put a gif of a monkey in its mouth."
39:16;39:20;"One of the ultimate, most disrespectful reviews of all time."
39:20;39:20;"It's raw."
39:20;39:25;"And I remember at the time I was speculating, I was like, well, that's so over the top that"
39:25;39:30;"maybe it's better than just like a 2000 word evisceration of why Jet is bad for humanity."
39:30;39:31;"That was like, maybe the Jet guys laughed it off."
39:31;39:34;"And then we actually found some of those like Jet guys were not pleased,"
39:34;39:35;"really hurt their feelings."
39:35;39:40;"And anyway, so then we get an email out of nowhere from a guy named Chris Kasky."
39:40;39:40;"And he said, what's up?"
39:40;39:42;"My name's Chris and blah, blah, blah."
39:42;39:43;"A huge fan of what you guys do."
39:43;39:44;"He's been listening to TC."
39:44;39:49;"And then he says, I ran Pitchfork and founded Programmed Air Festivals on top of that for like"
39:49;39:51;"14 years."
39:51;39:56;"And he goes on to say that there's so many things that he hears on TC that kind of intersect with"
39:56;39:57;"things in his own life."
39:57;40:02;"The fact that he booked Vampire and Boney Ver at an event."
40:02;40:08;"The fact that he actually wrote the Jet Monkey review, among other cruel reviews."
40:08;40:09;"And then also that he's a deadhead."
40:09;40:14;"So he's not at Pitchfork anymore, but he wrote us this nice email and basically"
40:14;40:19;"said like, you guys just keep bringing stuff up that I was actually in the middle of or"
40:19;40:22;"specifically responsible for, which has left me in a really weird headspace and just wanted"
40:22;40:24;"to share it with y'all."
40:24;40:24;"I can understand that."
40:24;40:28;"You're TC head, you're just kind of cruising through and then you start hearing like little"
40:28;40:29;"snippets from your own life."
40:29;40:29;"Yeah."
40:29;40:34;"And he said, if you guys ever want to go deep on the P-Fork, the dead/indie world from 2003 to"
40:34;40:37;"2017, here for it."
40:37;40:40;"He also said he was talking to Stephen Hyden about Goose and stuff."
40:40;40:44;"So, I mean, this guy's clearly part of the TCU."
40:44;40:44;"So we thought, why not?"
40:44;40:45;"Let's get him on the phone."
40:45;40:46;"Great."
40:46;40:47;"Let's chop it up."
40:47;40:48;"Great."
40:48;40:49;"Let's get on with Chris Kasky."
40:49;40:53;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
40:53;40:57;"Hello."
40:57;40:58;"Chris, what's up?"
40:58;40:59;"Hey, what's going on?"
40:59;41:00;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
41:00;41:01;"You're on with me and Jake."
41:01;41:02;"Yeah, excited to be here."
41:02;41:09;"We also got the fellas from Jet in the room, as well as Kevin Parker, who's kind of taking"
41:09;41:10;"a break from Tame Impala to manage them."
41:11;41:13;"No, but we really appreciate your email."
41:13;41:17;"And it's pretty wild that we seem to have so much in common."
41:17;41:23;"Yeah, it's been pretty surreal over the last kind of probably six months, maybe, just listening"
41:23;41:26;"and enjoying the show and enjoying everything you guys are covering."
41:26;41:32;"Just bottom line, being a fan of it, but also just reliving a life that in some ways, over"
41:32;41:36;"the last couple of years, I've kind of been like, just purposefully not thinking about."
41:36;41:39;"And then also just the amount of things that you're covering and the amount of things that"
41:39;41:42;"are happening at the same time, or even just perspectives happening at the same time."
41:42;41:42;"It's really fun."
41:42;41:43;"So I was like, you know what?"
41:43;41:47;"Don't really know what to do, but saying something and just reaching out and saying you appreciate"
41:47;41:48;"something has always been something I try to do."
41:48;41:50;"So I wanted to do that."
41:50;41:51;"So it's fun to work out."
41:51;41:53;"We really appreciated it."
41:53;41:57;"Okay, so you're saying the life that you're talking about of being a part of Pitchfork,"
41:57;41:59;"writing reviews and all that stuff, that's over."
41:59;42:00;"It's over, yeah."
42:00;42:02;"So this is a bit of an Irishman right now."
42:02;42:04;"You're an infamous hitman."
42:04;42:08;"You're an infamous hitman who left a life."
42:08;42:11;"I mean, I imagine you're still a fairly young guy, but you're sitting in a metaphorical"
42:11;42:14;"nursing home, no longer living the life."
42:14;42:16;"I'm definitely living a life."
42:16;42:18;"You're living a life, but a different life."
42:18;42:21;"And then me and Jake are just some intrepid journalists just coming in to find you and"
42:21;42:23;"be like, ""Hey man, is it true?"""
42:23;42:24;"I don't know."
42:24;42:25;"I don't know."
42:25;42:27;"That's where the metaphor ends."
42:27;42:28;"Maybe just like walk us through it."
42:28;42:29;"Like, what's your history?"
42:29;42:32;"So I started at Pitchfork in like 2003 and 2004."
42:32;42:36;"So Ryan had had the site going for like a good six or so years."
42:36;42:38;"And it was definitely, you know, it had a stable of critics."
42:38;42:42;"It had a loyal following, albeit, you know, somewhat small at the time."
42:42;42:44;"And I was like 22."
42:44;42:49;"So I met Ryan and effectively kind of came on to take over like all of the business of"
42:49;42:53;"everything that was happening there to try to enable the growth of what Pitchfork was."
42:53;42:55;"And so like, I'm not an actual writer."
42:55;42:57;"Like I ran everything else at Pitchfork."
42:57;43:00;"I ran the kind of creative and the brand and the business."
43:00;43:03;"And I programmed and booked the music festivals and founded those."
43:03;43:05;"But, you know, Ryan founded the site."
43:05;43:10;"And then we kind of, we've always viewed around 2000, 2004 as kind of like the"
43:10;43:14;"V2, if you will, of what happened next in terms of just formalizing a lot of things"
43:14;43:18;"and just trying to get people paid and trying to get the site working."
43:18;43:23;"And then obviously from there, it was kind of a large part of my professional life for"
43:23;43:24;"the last kind of 15 or so years."
43:24;43:27;"So you got out during the Conde Nast sale?"
43:27;43:27;"No, no."
43:27;43:29;"So Ryan and I were the only owners of the site."
43:29;43:34;"And so when we sold, we stuck around for a while and I left first and then Ryan left"
43:34;43:34;"second."
43:34;43:35;"Yeah, we were there."
43:35;43:37;"I was there for like almost 15 years after that."
43:37;43:38;"Wow."
43:38;43:38;"Okay."
43:38;43:39;"So that, yeah."
43:39;43:40;"Long time."
43:40;43:43;"So you didn't put your name on the Jet review?"
43:43;43:47;"No, that was attributed to a writer named Ray Suzuki, who does not exist, but was a"
43:47;43:52;"popular byline for kind of reviews that at the time didn't have a writer behind them"
43:52;43:56;"or didn't necessarily feel like it was appropriate to even put a writer on them."
43:56;43:56;"Okay."
43:56;43:58;"So paint a picture for me."
43:58;44:00;"Do you remember what year the Jet review was?"
44:00;44:04;"Jet was in 2000 and I think it was 2006."
44:04;44:08;"So I've been there a few years and we had over like probably a year or two."
44:08;44:14;"The site had been growing and what we were doing had been growing, but it was still akin"
44:14;44:18;"to a lot of things, whether it's a band or it's any company, whatever."
44:18;44:20;"You do a lot of things, you kind of just learn and grow."
44:20;44:25;"And so we were working in what is effectively like a private detective's office in the"
44:25;44:27;"Logan Square neighborhood in Chicago."
44:27;44:30;"And there was a restaurant we worked at every day called Lula Cafe, which is beneath us."
44:30;44:33;"And we were all sitting around and there was a review."
44:33;44:35;"I don't know if you guys remember the website, Tiny Mixtapes?"
44:35;44:36;"Sure."
44:36;44:36;"Yeah."
44:36;44:37;"So Tiny Mixtapes is great."
44:37;44:41;"And they had a review, I think a year prior, maybe around there that I was obsessed with"
44:41;44:45;"personally, just because as someone that influenced editorial strategy and thinking about how"
44:45;44:50;"basically to protect criticism and to try to continue that forward and to develop a world"
44:50;44:52;"in which that actually is at the forefront."
44:52;44:56;"They had been obsessed over just the notion of what they did with this Nine Inch Nails"
44:56;44:58;"review, which was they didn't give it a review."
44:58;45:03;"They wrote it basically like a screenshot of them throwing it into the garbage can on"
45:03;45:06;"their computer, which just at the time was like, ""Oh my God, this is just great."""
45:06;45:08;"It's like the irreverence and all that."
45:08;45:13;"And at the time, criticism was in the internet even were somewhat kind of uncharted territory"
45:13;45:15;"in terms of how the New Guard had taken over."
45:15;45:18;"We were definitely like punks on the internet."
45:18;45:22;"While all the traditional critics in traditional print publications were kind of like, ""These"
45:22;45:23;"guys don't do anything."
45:23;45:24;"They're just clowns."
45:24;45:25;"Anything's available."""
45:25;45:28;"And we really wanted to legitimize ourselves, but at the same time have fun and utilize"
45:28;45:30;"the medium that was kind of available to us."
45:30;45:34;"Thinking about that Tiny Mixtape review and thinking about just like deleting a Nine Inch"
45:34;45:39;"Nails record, which is cruel, but at the same time, it was hilarious for 24 year olds and"
45:39;45:41;"26 year olds or whatever we all were."
45:41;45:45;"And also not really necessarily understanding the way in which the internet was growing"
45:45;45:46;"and the audience was growing."
45:46;45:49;"Just like, you know what, this review, it had already gotten, the first review had already"
45:49;45:52;"been given this kind of like very long form."
45:52;45:56;"The writer had just kind of written this like very great piece of prose and just really"
45:56;45:57;"messed around with it and gave it a terrible review."
45:57;45:59;"So it was kind of like, how do you do that again?"
45:59;46:00;"You know, that was kind of where it spawned."
46:00;46:01;"And we were just sitting at lunch."
46:01;46:02;"It's like, you know what?"
46:02;46:03;"I was like, ""Hey guys, I got the review for you."
46:03;46:07;"Let's just have it be this video I saw earlier of a monkey f***ing in its own mouth."""
46:07;46:10;"And everyone laughed and we thought it was funny."
46:10;46:11;"And then like, you know, the next day you can put it on the internet."
46:11;46:16;"It is really interesting to think that you as somebody who wasn't like a full-time critic,"
46:16;46:22;"that you were somebody who was thinking about what does this form look like in this totally"
46:22;46:23;"new world?"
46:23;46:26;"I don't know if philosophically is like too highfalutin, but you were thinking this big"
46:26;46:33;"picture way about what moves do we make that feel fresh and that actually pushes this form"
46:33;46:37;"into the 21st century, which is also interesting now because you see so many people talking"
46:37;46:43;"about like that criticism, professional criticism is kind of over because of the democratization"
46:43;46:49;"of like writing about music on the internet and how easy it is to listen to stuff and"
46:49;46:49;"all that."
46:49;46:54;"So anyway, I think it's correct to point this out as like an important moment in music journalism."
46:54;47:00;"At the time in 2006, did it still kind of feel like basically just like a blog?"
47:00;47:01;"Kind of."
47:01;47:01;"Yes."
47:01;47:05;"I think we'd had like a very interesting couple of years."
47:05;47:09;"You know, there was like everything from a big Arcade Fire review to like a Travis Stan"
47:09;47:10;"review."
47:10;47:13;"And ultimately, we'd also done like our first festival in 2005."
47:13;47:18;"So we were seeing the kind of combination of the internet and then like physical, tangible,"
47:18;47:21;"whatever you want to call it, culture and how that was aligning."
47:21;47:24;"And then obviously it was like pre omnipresence of streaming media."
47:24;47:26;"So everyone was just like downloads and leaks and all that."
47:26;47:31;"And so, you know, when we started, it was like, let's create, let's like make a music"
47:31;47:32;"magazine on the internet."
47:32;47:33;"That's always what Ryan wanted to do."
47:33;47:36;"But I would say that up until like 2003 and 2004, I think you'd probably be equated to"
47:36;47:37;"a blog."
47:37;47:40;"I think what we were thinking about ourselves then was probably more ambitious, but at the"
47:40;47:45;"same time, it was uncharted territory with regards to how the audience would suddenly"
47:45;47:45;"react to that."
47:45;47:47;"You know, we relished having an opinion."
47:47;47:50;"We relished having people that were paying attention, which was amazing."
47:50;47:54;"The fact that you could like put on a music festival, again, celebrating the music."
47:54;47:56;"We weren't starting that thing to like make a business."
47:56;47:59;"So like doing all that felt like you were doing something."
47:59;48:03;"And, you know, again, this is where like the dead analog start to flow in, but it's like"
48:03;48:06;"creating things that feel good and that are bringing in community and that are being done"
48:06;48:07;"in a way that's non-traditional."
48:07;48:12;"And we also like love the fact that this is where it kind of is equates to a blogger,"
48:12;48:17;"however, but the structure, we weren't required to like submit, listen to advances."
48:17;48:20;"And then give it six weeks until the print edition comes out."
48:20;48:25;"We could literally just like listen to things, be instinctual, be proactive and just say"
48:25;48:26;"like, you know what, this is great."
48:26;48:28;"Let's say something about it or let's begin to cover it."
48:28;48:29;"In those days, it was 100%."
48:29;48:32;"Like there was not a lot of like pre-thought in that."
48:32;48:34;"Just let's go because this is fun."
48:34;48:38;"And so when you guys are talking about it, this record in particular, everybody, and"
48:38;48:42;"I'm going to be like devil's advocate here a little bit, which is often what I do on"
48:42;48:42;"the show."
48:42;48:43;"No, it's all good."
48:43;48:48;"Had everybody listened to the whole Jet record and really spent time with it and engaged"
48:48;48:52;"with it or, and I totally could understand this perspective or for you guys being in"
48:52;48:59;"Chicago and being 2006 Pitchfork, Jet was just so outside of the realm of what you thought"
48:59;49:04;"was cool that it was like you felt no obligation to like engage the way you would have with"
49:04;49:06;"like an Arcade Fire record at the time."
49:06;49:08;"Like I'm curious about that angle."
49:08;49:08;"Totally."
49:08;49:10;"And I, there's a few things in there."
49:10;49:13;"I mean, obviously, first and foremost, like, again, I don't want to sound defensive because"
49:13;49:16;"it's absolutely not defensiveness more than like the beauty that we felt at Pitchfork"
49:16;49:17;"for a long time."
49:17;49:21;"And I can't speak to what they're doing now, but it's, I imagine no different is that"
49:21;49:21;"like cool."
49:21;49:24;"Wasn't ever like, what would the, that wasn't ever the metric, even though it definitely"
49:24;49:25;"felt like that."
49:25;49:29;"I think that's where the idea of like opinions and all that conflates with the idea of cool,"
49:29;49:32;"where again, I could be also delusional and completely like, just not willing to look"
49:32;49:34;"myself in the mirror and admit something."
49:34;49:38;"But, you know, looking at something like Jet, it was like, yeah, in Chicago, you're"
49:38;49:40;"kind of removed from the music industry."
49:40;49:43;"You're looking at these like is about as objective as you can."
49:43;49:47;"And having already heard and given the time to the first record, like the second record,"
49:47;49:50;"yeah, you listen to it and you're just like, compared to the things that were coming out"
49:50;49:54;"2006, I mean, there were so many good bands coming out in between 2006, 2010."
49:54;49:58;"Again, just you're seeing all this kind of reminiscing now, given what's ever happening"
49:58;49:59;"with music in general."
49:59;50:04;"And Jet was just like, I mean, you guys nailed it last on the show where you talked about"
50:04;50:04;"it."
50:04;50:06;"It's just like, you're listening to it's like, oh, Kelly, that's an all right riff or"
50:06;50:06;"whatever."
50:06;50:09;"But ultimately, just like had no place, I don't think."
50:09;50:13;"And it probably didn't have a lot of value at the time to like how we were thinking about"
50:13;50:14;"what music was."
50:14;50:19;"So it wasn't like not worth words, but it also just wasn't worth more vitriol in the"
50:19;50:20;"written form."
50:20;50:22;"So instead, it was just like, how can you best describe that?"
50:22;50:25;"And it wasn't the only time, obviously, that that happened moving forward."
50:25;50:29;"But what was the review that you referenced before?"
50:29;50:30;"Oh, yeah, that's the Travis Dan."
50:30;50:31;"That's Travis Morrison."
50:31;50:32;"Yeah."
50:32;50:34;"OK, that was what he called this record that got a zero point zero."
50:34;50:40;"So I guess to be fair, because I could imagine that Jet to some extent, like you said, you"
50:40;50:42;"guys sitting in Chicago and I respect that, too."
50:42;50:44;"You weren't in like New York or L.A. You weren't in the belly of the beast."
50:44;50:49;"You're in this place that has its own culture and its own like a little obviously Chicago"
50:49;50:51;"is literally the third biggest city in America."
50:51;50:55;"It's no stranger to big corporate money or something, but it's still as far as the media"
50:55;50:57;"goes, it's not a hotspot."
50:57;51:00;"It's not New York or L.A. in terms of like maybe how beholden it is."
51:00;51:03;"I don't know the best way to describe it, but I guess you can make the case."
51:03;51:07;"And I'm trying to look at this from like the kind of point of view that, yeah, maybe that"
51:07;51:12;"you guys are think of Jet is this band like major label kind of rock band from Australia."
51:12;51:17;"They weren't in dialogue with any of the bands you're championing at the time, like they"
51:17;51:18;"in Arcade Fire at that era."
51:18;51:19;"They were like from different planets."
51:19;51:22;"It's not like they were part of the same community of global rock music."
51:22;51:28;"But Travis Stan and I got to be honest here, I'm totally ignorant about dismemberment plan"
51:28;51:29;"or his music."
51:29;51:31;"That's just like I just really don't know that music."
51:31;51:33;"Pitchfork is like a longstanding fan."
51:33;51:33;"Right."
51:33;51:34;"So that was the dismemberment plan."
51:34;51:35;"That was a big thing."
51:35;51:38;"You guys probably wouldn't have to think twice about double check."
51:38;51:40;"Do we really hate this record?"
51:40;51:44;"You probably didn't have to be like, well, before we hit send, before we post this, we"
51:44;51:45;"got to think about something."
51:45;51:48;"We see the Jet guys at the empty bottle once a week, man."
51:48;51:49;"We were just crushing Bruce bottle."
51:49;51:53;"We just, you know, yeah, whatever."
51:53;51:57;"And I get I'm not obviously I don't think Travis Morrison lived in Chicago, but you"
51:57;51:57;"know what I mean?"
51:57;51:59;"That was actually closer to your universe."
51:59;52:00;"It was 100 percent."
52:00;52:05;"Yeah, was that one more of like a take a deep breath and be like, we're cutting ties?"
52:05;52:07;"Well, I mean, I don't think it was thought of that way."
52:07;52:12;"I think that you're definitely like saying, hey, this is a stark departure from this person's"
52:12;52:16;"original band and to the point where you effectively score it in a useless fashion."
52:16;52:21;"But I think I would still I mean, I haven't read that review in a while, but I bet it"
52:21;52:24;"got like 3000 words written about why it's not good."
52:24;52:30;"And, you know, in a way that showcased the respect that the site and the writer had for"
52:30;52:33;"like, you know, whatever, six, I can't remember."
52:33;52:36;"I think there's like actually only two or three dismemberment plan records, but, you"
52:36;52:40;"know, a history of music that this member put out that then had this like departure"
52:40;52:44;"into solo around the band had broken up and it was kind of like I have no I mean, again,"
52:44;52:48;"like the writers were always kind of independently able to then score the record as they submitted"
52:48;52:49;"the review to."
52:49;52:52;"So it's not like it was some sort of behind the curtain stuff."
52:52;52:57;"It was obviously like a collaboration between the editors and the writer to settle on something"
52:57;53:00;"if there was any sort of difference as we kind of like matured, for lack of a better"
53:00;53:01;"word."
53:01;53:05;"We probably started to find writers that were more akin to way in which like the editors"
53:05;53:07;"or anyone was thinking about the music."
53:07;53:11;"So if like our editor in chief at the time was like, I love the new Radiohead record,"
53:11;53:14;"the likelihood of them like giving that to a writer that would give it a two or whatever"
53:14;53:15;"would not happen."
53:15;53:24;"This song is for the orca, swimming round in circles at SeaWorld someday."
53:24;53:27;"You'll drown the dude with the clipboard someday."
53:27;53:39;"This song is for the gator, laying in the roadside cage in FLA."
53:39;53:42;"You'll tear the cracker to shreds someday."
53:43;53:49;"Well I'll read about you in USA Today."
53:49;53:59;"And it feels so nice that the Lord made this day."
53:59;54:09;"And it feels so right to know that justice will have its say."
54:09;54:15;"You know, even as you talk about it, even me, and you can imagine as a musician, I got"
54:15;54:18;"all sorts of complicated feelings as a musician."
54:18;54:18;"Oh my God."
54:18;54:22;"But also as somebody who just loves chopping it up about this type of shit too, just like"
54:22;54:25;"a music nerd and somebody who hosts a radio show."
54:25;54:30;"I have mixed and complicated feelings about criticism and you know, when is it fair?"
54:30;54:34;"But that said, as you describe that scene and stuff, and I'm always like sensitive to"
54:34;54:37;"how a musician would feel in a circumstance, but as you describe it, you know, maybe it's"
54:37;54:40;"an age thing, but I feel like a nostalgia for that era too."
54:40;54:44;"Even as somebody who would have just maybe been reading Pitchfork, as I've talked about"
54:44;54:48;"on the show, I did have my one attempt to write for Dusted Magazine in which I reviewed"
54:48;54:48;"it."
54:48;54:49;"Oh nice, Dusted's good."
54:49;54:50;"Dirty Projectors record."
54:50;54:52;"Oh, very cool."
54:52;54:55;"But I just realized I didn't have it in me."
54:55;54:58;"I was interested in writing, but I didn't have quite the right attitude to be like,"
54:58;55:00;"if I didn't like something, I just didn't have anything."
55:00;55:01;"I didn't have an interesting take on it."
55:01;55:06;"That's where I'm not a critic in a similar way where it's like thinking about music and"
55:06;55:08;"chopping it up about this stuff is where this all lives."
55:08;55:12;"But for me, like putting pen to paper and writing 3000 words about Jed, like that was"
55:12;55:15;"ultimately why that review was so bad or good is that it's just a YouTube video."
55:15;55:20;"It's like, this is the representation of this record, you know, in my opinion, which again,"
55:20;55:20;"for better or worse."
55:20;55:23;"As we're having this conversation, a bunch of things are going through my mind."
55:23;55:25;"A bunch of stuff that I've read recently."
55:25;55:32;"One was kind of the disturbing story of, I think the Chicago reader, one of the big alt"
55:32;55:33;"weeklies in Chicago."
55:33;55:34;"It's the reader."
55:34;55:35;"I don't know if you saw this."
55:35;55:39;"Somebody wrote this kind of like long thing about the kind of, you know, just that used"
55:39;55:44;"to be, and maybe it is once again, it had a little bit of an optimistic ending, but similar"
55:44;55:50;"to the village voice and all over this country, it was one of many alt weeklies, which existed,"
55:50;55:58;"served their local community and provided a place where a critic with a significant readership"
55:58;56:00;"could just say the opposite thing from what everybody else was saying."
56:00;56:02;"They could just be like, you know what?"
56:02;56:04;"That critic's choice movie f***ing sucks."
56:04;56:05;"That fan stuff."
56:05;56:10;"This article was about that place getting bought and sold and some of the long time"
56:10;56:16;"writers and readers, you know, feeling mistreated on some like succession f*** just like big,"
56:16;56:19;"big equity company coming in and, and you know, then they're talking."
56:19;56:20;"It's been pretty brutal."
56:20;56:20;"Yeah."
56:20;56:23;"So it was like, it was a disturbing story just from the point of view of anybody who"
56:23;56:27;"appreciates independent media, but it was also a little bit about just like, as much"
56:27;56:32;"as we have a platform, you could find anybody saying anything at any given time, right?"
56:32;56:36;"Like you could find somebody saying like jet rolls, pitchfork sucks."
56:36;56:37;"You can find any opinion at any given time."
56:37;56:42;"So you have more noise and more anger and you can find more opinions, but you actually,"
56:42;56:46;"that person, that, that archetype of like the alt weekly writer who truly believes what"
56:46;56:46;"they're saying."
56:46;56:50;"They're not just trying to get retweets or likes or just stir the pot on Twitter."
56:50;56:54;"That alt weekly writer who has their column, who's just like, yeah, you know, this week's"
56:54;56:58;"hyscal neighbor, we're just like all about like Schindler's list."
56:58;57:01;"Here's 10, you know, just like going in 3000 words about why I think that."
57:01;57:02;"Oh yeah."
57:02;57:05;"I just remember reading this article and even not having grown up with the Chicago"
57:05;57:09;"reader and you know, I knew village voice a little bit being in the tri-state area."
57:09;57:13;"I was kind of like, it made me nostalgic for something that a different media ecosystem"
57:13;57:16;"that I could remember from childhood or something."
57:16;57:21;"And then I also saw something actually, uh, Stephen Hyden, who you, uh, mentioned, he"
57:21;57:26;"had an interesting tweet that I saw that where he was saying something about, he was glad"
57:26;57:29;"that he came up when he did, cause he was allowed to still be based in the Midwest."
57:29;57:33;"He didn't have to move to New York or LA and work for some giant company."
57:33;57:37;"And then I saw some people commenting about like maybe other writers being like, yeah,"
57:37;57:41;"obviously New York and LA have people with all different perspectives from all around"
57:41;57:41;"the country."
57:41;57:42;"Right."
57:42;57:46;"You know, not everybody's a native New Yorker or native LA person, but still when everybody"
57:46;57:52;"ends up in the same place, it's still somehow, it blunts some type of diversity of opinion"
57:52;57:53;"about art."
57:53;57:55;"And people were saying, I even think that really stuck with me."
57:55;57:58;"Somebody made a comment just like, yeah, you know, music just sounds different, different"
57:58;57:58;"places."
57:58;58:01;"And I was like, Oh, that's kind of deep actually when you put it that way."
58:01;58:03;"So anyway, I was thinking about those two things."
58:03;58:07;"And I also just read the Susan Sontag biography that talks about like the, her scene of New"
58:07;58:09;"York critics and they lived and died by criticism."
58:09;58:11;"That was like the highest art form for them."
58:11;58:16;"But then there was also this type of like competitiveness and pettiness between them"
58:16;58:17;"and all this stuff."
58:17;58:22;"So anyway, I guess it's all to say that like, when I think of the, the Jet Review, it might"
58:22;58:24;"be kind of mean, but it also, yeah, I don't know."
58:24;58:28;"There's just something about it that's like weirdly like charming to me as much as I'm"
58:28;58:32;"somebody who's like always pro kind vibes and you cannot describe that as kind vibes."
58:32;58:33;"Yeah, I mean, I'm with you."
58:33;58:33;"Totally."
58:33;58:37;"I'm not talking about Pitchfork in particular, but, but just media in general, right?"
58:37;58:42;"Like there's something about that energy is gone and it's like, maybe it exists."
58:42;58:44;"I've been like, you know, lamenting it."
58:44;58:48;"Old, like some of like old colleagues at Pitchfork, like our role editor in chief, Mark, he and"
58:48;58:52;"I were recently talking just like lamenting, not the fact that like criticism doesn't exist"
58:52;58:54;"because it does and it's still good."
58:54;58:58;"It almost like by and large in the places that invest in criticism are still putting"
58:58;58:59;"hiring good writers."
58:59;59:02;"There are still amazing writers coming up that like believe in it."
59:02;59:05;"It's just, you alluded to earlier, which is this, this like splintering of ways in which"
59:05;59:07;"it gets to the world."
59:07;59:10;"I think that's where Pitchfork benefited from is that it was kind of like a, it was a more"
59:10;59:14;"singular conduit for just context opinion."
59:14;59:15;"It was a one way dialogue."
59:15;59:18;"Obviously there was no like commenting and all that, but it wasn't, it was very much"
59:18;59:19;"like an alt weekly."
59:19;59:22;"Like the alt weeklies are some of the people that, you know, as much as they would, the"
59:22;59:25;"writers would write for us, the editors would be moan us because we'd be on the internet"
59:25;59:29;"being able to do what we did and start to take away win from their sales and vice versa."
59:29;59:33;"You know, like it was, it was very much like a kindred spirit and as to an alt weekly."
59:33;59:36;"And I think that the reader is a great example, at least in Chicago, as you kind of recognize"
59:36;59:40;"it's like it, like the voice, like we had writers from the reader, we had writers from"
59:40;59:41;"the voice."
59:41;59:43;"You go and look at the concert listings for the week in the reader."
59:43;59:45;"And that was what, like, that was the Bible."
59:45;59:47;"It wasn't every concert playing in Chicago."
59:47;59:48;"It's just like the ones that the reader thought were good."
59:48;59:53;"And just having that like minor opinion on something through a conduit, like that you"
59:53;59:55;"trusted, like the reader was definitely inspirational."
59:55;59:57;"Same way that all alt weeklies really were."
59:57;01:00:00;"And again, at the time was like, there was just less going on."
01:00:00;01:00:07;"So you had an ability to kind of be able to refine the craft, be better at your job, have"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"fun with it also in respect, the fact that the medium is different."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"Like, you know, they weren't memes."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"There weren't like Twitter."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I remember like the first, I was one of the first tweets I ever did on Pitchfork's account"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"was like, I thought that sun chips were better than Radiohead."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"And that would never go on like Twitter now."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"Wait, I think it's still there."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"Wait, that was one of the first Pitchfork Twitter accounts?"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"That was, I think, I swear to God, I tweeted that from my kitchen."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"And it was like, this is 2008, whenever Twitter launched."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"And we had it, we're like, oh, we got to get a Twitter thing, which is literally how we"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"probably sounded."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"And then I was in my kitchen."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"I'm like eating sun chips."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I'm like, man, these are better than Radiohead."
01:00:38;01:00:38;"Full stop."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"So I put it on Twitter."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"And then you go back and look at like the beginning of time."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"And it's like, that's on Pitchfork's Twitter."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"That doesn't seem right."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"But we didn't know what Twitter was, you know, like."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"Yeah, if you saw that, you'd be like, oh, that's like a parody account."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Yeah, totally."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"Well, anyway, Chris, I think I'm sure we have more to talk about, but I think it's good"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"maybe for this one just to keep it to jet and that."
01:00:57;01:00:57;"Oh, totally."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"Pitchfork day, so hopefully you'll call in again."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"Oh, yeah, man."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"I just had a thought."
01:01:01;01:01:06;"I think it would be a good thing for the universe if, even though I know you're not there anymore,"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"but you must still have some connections there."
01:01:08;01:01:14;"If Pitchfork changed their masthead motto from the most trusted voice in music to"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"""sun chips are better than Radiohead."""
01:01:16;01:01:22;"I just think that's that type of chaotic energy that the music media ecosystem needs."
01:01:22;01:01:22;"I agree."
01:01:22;01:01:26;"Just see what you can do, you know, even just like for a month."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yeah, I'm doubtful, but."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"Well, yeah, thanks a lot, Chris."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"No, I appreciate you guys."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"We'll talk to you again in the future."
01:01:32;01:01:32;"Have a good one."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Yeah, be well."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Peace."
01:01:35;01:01:35;"Bye."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"This is a pretty guest heavy episode, but I think we got some interesting guests this time."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"One, this was a recommendation for Seinfeld."
01:02:40;01:02:40;"Shout out to Seinfeld."

01:02:52;01:02:57;"So it's probably fair to say that she kind of created the modern corporate Twitter account"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"that we spend so much time talking about."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"So she's out there telling her story, I guess already two years ago."

01:04:53;01:04:54;"And it's like, ""How?"""
01:04:54;01:04:58;"And he's like, ""We're just going to tweet all sorts of fun, random stuff."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"It's going to really get people laughing and going."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"And then you kind of come in and say like, ""All right, guys, jokes aside."""
01:05:03;01:05:04;"And that's essentially what he did."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Dropping the hammer here."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Jokes aside."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Can we get serious for a second?"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"Yeah, so he said, ""Now that my team's got your attention, can I just say something?"""
01:05:11;01:05:13;"It's just kind of brutal."
01:05:13;01:05:13;"But anyway..."
01:05:13;01:05:16;"You had our attention in like the lamest possible sense of the word."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"Right."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"I did like this one kind of."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Which one?"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"""For participating in the 1984 debates,"
01:05:21;01:05:26;"Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan each received a $25 cracker barrel gift certificate."""
01:05:26;01:05:27;"Because that almost sounds true."
01:05:27;01:05:28;"I don't know why."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"That was the only one where I was like, ""That's kind of funny."""
01:05:31;01:05:32;"It's an alternative history."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"Yeah, that's the best one."
01:05:33;01:05:37;"But anyway, I guess the reason I take the time to say that now,"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"and maybe because I want to ask her about it,"
01:05:38;01:05:43;"I think this kind of mode of using social media might not exist without Amy Brown."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Right, right."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"So anyway, let's get Amy on the phone and let's..."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"This is kind of a big deal on Time Crisis."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"We're finally..."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"I wish Seinfeld was here."
01:05:51;01:05:51;"I know."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"It's really too bad."
01:05:52;01:05:53;"But this is an interesting episode."
01:05:53;01:05:57;"We're talking to somebody who helped build up early to mid 2000s Pitchfork"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"and somebody helped build up mid 2010s Wendy's."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Corporate Twitter."
01:06:02;01:06:07;"Those are two people who helped create modern culture as we know it, for better or for worse."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"And they're real TC touchstones."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"That's right."
01:06:10;01:06:14;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:06:14;01:06:19;"Hey, it's Amy."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Hey, Amy, this is Ezra and you're on Time Crisis with me and Jake."
01:06:22;01:06:22;"Hi."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"Hi."
01:06:23;01:06:27;"Before we really get into it, we just got to ask you a real hot button question."
01:06:27;01:06:31;"Are you the person who's behind the Mike Bloomberg campaign tweets?"
01:06:31;01:06:32;"Oh my God."
01:06:32;01:06:39;"No, I cannot take responsibility for Mike Bloomberg's face on a meatball."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"I'm sorry."
01:06:40;01:06:47;"I just want to say that whatever one might think about the modern corporate Twitter escape,"
01:06:47;01:06:55;"whether it's Wendy's, Wendy's Savage clapbacks or Stakehams philosophical musings or whatever,"
01:06:55;01:06:58;"at the very least, they all feel modern."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"There's something about all these tweets that I was just saying to Jake,"
01:07:01;01:07:06;"reminds me of like pre-social media internet humor, just like freaking random."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"Do you remember when there used to be these jokes about like Chuck Norris and stuff?"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"Yeah."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Doesn't have that energy of just like..."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Mike Bloomberg facts."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"Yeah. Mike Bloomberg facts."
01:07:13;01:07:19;"Mike Bloomberg once ate 30 sandwiches in two minutes."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"It just feels like..."
01:07:20;01:07:23;"He could punch through your face."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Yeah."
01:07:24;01:07:28;"So I kind of wonder if we want to get to the bottom of who's behind them"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"and maybe they're a mastermind."
01:07:30;01:07:34;"I don't want to be hard on them, but it just like, it doesn't feel like somebody under 30."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"It doesn't even feel like somebody under 35."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"I would say 40."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"It doesn't feel like somebody under 40."
01:07:39;01:07:44;"If somehow it's somebody who's listening to this show and they're just like 23 straight out of"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"college, I'm sorry."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"Maybe you're doing 3D chess that we don't understand, but you know what I mean?"
01:07:49;01:07:54;"I got the feeling that it's someone at like a marketing agency."
01:07:54;01:07:59;"It sounded very much like marketing agency copywriter to me."
01:07:59;01:08:03;"Not somebody on the campaign who works in politics, but has a good sense of humor."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Yeah. Like someone who writes ads."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"And that also makes total sense for like a billionaire's campaign."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"They're just like, ""Hire a marketing team."""
01:08:09;01:08:12;"They have money to flush down the toilet. Like, why wouldn't they do that?"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Right."
01:08:13;01:08:19;"But anyway, now that you have, I think, convinced us that you're not behind the Bloomberg tweets,"
01:08:19;01:08:20;"it's an honor to have you on the show."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"It's an honor to be here. Thank you for having me."
01:08:22;01:08:26;"I know you've written about this, but for our listeners who maybe haven't heard the whole story,"
01:08:26;01:08:31;"you want to just walk us through the early days, how you got the job and lead us up to"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"when you finally first went viral, got your taste of blood,"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"and then was off to the races. Can we hear about that?"
01:08:37;01:08:43;"Sure. So I got a job running social media for Wendy's in 2012."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"And what were you doing before that?"
01:08:45;01:08:50;"I was a marketing copywriter for a small agency in Columbus, Ohio, which is..."
01:08:50;01:08:54;"Wendy's is based in Dublin, Ohio, which is a suburb of Columbus."
01:08:54;01:08:58;"I was writing website copy for municipal governments and stuff."
01:08:58;01:09:02;"I went to college. I got a journalism degree specifically in newspaper journalism."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"So I graduated and could not get a job at a newspaper."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"You know, I don't want to make too big a deal out of this."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"This sounds familiar."
01:09:09;01:09:14;"But you are the second social media manager or person who's been involved in doing social"
01:09:14;01:09:20;"media for a fast food brand who studied journalism and found the job market too"
01:09:20;01:09:26;"brutal and went into that world. The other was a guy from a Texas-based Wings chain called Pluckers."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Oh, Matt?"
01:09:27;01:09:28;"Oh, you know him?"
01:09:28;01:09:33;"Yeah, I know him. Yeah, we all know each other. It's like the mafia."
01:09:33;01:09:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:09:36;01:09:43;"So I got hired in-house at Wendy's. I was the first... They didn't have anyone doing it in-house."
01:09:43;01:09:48;"So I got to come in, sort of build this thing. We worked with an agency."
01:09:48;01:09:54;"This was back in 2012. So nobody was really paying that much attention to what we were doing."
01:09:54;01:09:59;"So internally, we had a lot of creative freedom to just do kind of weird stuff."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"And it sort of flew under the radar."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"That's sort of what I've always enjoyed about social media as a career,"
01:10:05;01:10:11;"is it's still a creative outlet. Still get to do a lot of interesting, weird sh*t."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"Also, I've always just been on the internet. So that's sort of..."
01:10:14;01:10:19;"That combines my background in writing and creative stuff with the fact that I was"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"always on the internet growing up."
01:10:20;01:10:25;"And so you're saying you didn't have a ton of oversight, but did you have a mandate?"
01:10:25;01:10:30;"Were they just like, ""We want you to use this Twitter account to remind people of Wendy's"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"integrity""?"
01:10:31;01:10:39;"There were goals and oversight, right? We used it for very specific marketing campaigns. I think"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"the number one thing we were trying to do is... When I started at Wendy's,"
01:10:42;01:10:47;"they had just undergone a rebrand. So the cups used to be yellow, and now they're white."
01:10:47;01:10:52;"And they updated the Wendy logo with the face with the pigtails and stuff."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"And they're taking old-fashioned off the signs."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"So they're really trying to... I don't know if you've seen,"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"they redesigned a bunch of their restaurants to make them look more modern."
01:11:00;01:11:04;"So they're really trying to bring a whole new brand to Wendy's."
01:11:04;01:11:09;"Because previously, it was sort of like... I don't know. My grandma really liked Wendy's, right?"
01:11:09;01:11:14;"It's a place where old people go to get chili. That's what we heard a lot."
01:11:14;01:11:18;"So they're trying to make Wendy's, I guess, a little bit cooler."
01:11:18;01:11:24;"So this idea of putting some humanity on Wendy's, I guess. Making it a place that you're not like..."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Like if you go get Wendy's and bring it back to the office,"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"you're not sneaking it back into the office."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Was Dave still alive then?"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"No. Dave died in..."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"Early 2000s?"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"Yeah, early 2000s."
01:11:36;01:11:42;"So I can imagine that the post-Dave, who literally was the human face of Wendy's..."
01:11:42;01:11:42;"Yeah."
01:11:42;01:11:46;"That then after that, you're like, ""All right, you got this kind of sweet old man"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"named his chain after his daughter that's real old-fashioned."""
01:11:49;01:11:53;"But then once he's gone, it's like old-fashioned for no reason."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"That must have been an awkward time."
01:11:55;01:11:58;"Yeah. And they sort of... I think from a business standpoint too,"
01:11:58;01:12:03;"which is not really my area of interest or expertise, but I think they sort of..."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"You have fast food, right? But then they also started to see all these fast,"
01:12:06;01:12:11;"casual restaurants closing in. Like Five Guys and Chipotle and all these restaurants that"
01:12:11;01:12:17;"aren't quite fast food but are a little bit nicer. They're trying to make Wendy's seem a"
01:12:17;01:12:22;"little bit nicer, a little more upscale. Trying to get people to consider going to Wendy's who"
01:12:22;01:12:27;"maybe hadn't considered going to Wendy's before or maybe not in a long time."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"So sort of doing a lot of different things with the Twitter account, right?"
01:12:31;01:12:36;"There's always a limited time sandwich for four to six weeks. So just getting people to know"
01:12:36;01:12:40;"that there's this super mega Baconator or whatever."
01:12:40;01:12:44;"Yeah. Of course, they're going to be saying, ""Super mega Baconator is on sale,"" or ""Buy one,"
01:12:44;01:12:51;"get one free,"" whatever. We opened a new Wendy's in Tampa. But from the start, they were like,"
01:12:51;01:12:57;"""In between those tweets, just have fun."" Or even in the beginning, that wasn't part of it."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"Because now we take it for granted that if you're a social media manager,"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"your job is to just go viral."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"Just brawl with other brands."
01:13:04;01:13:09;"Yeah. And just get into it. But back then, was it just like, ""Make sure that people are aware"
01:13:09;01:13:13;"of the campaigns and come up with some creative ideas."""
01:13:13;01:13:14;"Something light, irreverent."
01:13:14;01:13:21;"Yeah. All the tweets had some sort of business purpose, right? Get people thinking about"
01:13:21;01:13:26;"eating Wendy's. The place where we had the most creative freedom and the least oversight,"
01:13:26;01:13:32;"I would say, where I think you probably saw where Wendy's started to go viral and continued to go"
01:13:32;01:13:37;"viral is where we got to reply back and forth to people. Because there actually was kind of..."
01:13:37;01:13:44;"For every post that is just written and outbound, it goes through the social media manager and"
01:13:44;01:13:51;"a brand marketer and an entire legal department. So there is a lot of oversight for social posts."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Every single tweet, including replies?"
01:13:54;01:13:59;"Not replies. That's why replies are the ones that are more fun and can go viral,"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"because those don't have as much of an approval process. But yeah,"
01:14:02;01:14:08;"if you see a tweet from a brand that's just a standalone tweet that's not to another human"
01:14:08;01:14:13;"being, it's probably been reviewed and approved by five or six different people,"
01:14:13;01:14:14;"including a legal department."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"So you're saying that's kind of standard at most big companies."
01:14:18;01:14:18;"Yeah."
01:14:18;01:14:21;"It's weird in a way, though, because it's like,"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"you can get in a lot of trouble tweeting at individual people too."
01:14:25;01:14:25;"Yes."
01:14:25;01:14:30;"I got the Mega Baconator tweet approved. But then I told that guy to f*ck my d*ck."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"I was well within my rights."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"Legally."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"Straight facts tryna take the sweat but we don't want it back"
01:14:48;01:14:52;"I'm a boss chick and they hate with that but we tried your food with a flavor app"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"You number one, that's a joke Why your ice cream machine always broke?"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"Why your drive-through always slow? Why your innovation just can't grow?"
01:14:58;01:15:03;"Is Queen we need the same old? Nope, uh That baconator go crazy"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"That spicy chicken go crazy You could take a fry and dip it in the sauce"
01:15:06;01:15:09;"It'd still be so tasty Them lil' tweets don't face me"
01:15:09;01:15:14;"McDonald's be so lazy I know the reason you hate me 'cause I'm fastfood's first lady"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"But so you knew that from the jump So you always had that in your back pocket"
01:15:18;01:15:22;"'Cause that is, and I just want to tell the listeners, that is how Amy first went viral"
01:15:22;01:15:26;"Which as I'm looking at it, I gotta say, this is a great exchange"
01:15:26;01:15:30;"Somebody tweeted at Wendy's, ""Your beef is frozen and we all know it"""
01:15:30;01:15:33;"You guys, we laugh at your slogan ""Fresh never frozen"" right?"
01:15:33;01:15:37;"Like you're really a joke And then you, straight up you, not Wendy's"
01:15:37;01:15:41;"but you Amy, tweeted, ""Sorry to hear you think that, but you're wrong."
01:15:41;01:15:44;"We've only ever used fresh beef since we were founded in 1969."""
01:15:44;01:15:48;"Still kinda corporate, you know, just like really political"
01:15:48;01:15:53;"And then he wrote, ""So you deliver it raw on a hot truck?"""
01:15:53;01:15:56;"And then you wrote That's a very confusing question"
01:15:56;01:16:00;"And then you wrote, ""Where do you store cold things that aren't frozen?"""
01:16:00;01:16:01;"And then he wrote back, ""Y'all should give up."
01:16:01;01:16:04;"McDonald's got you guys beat with a dope ass breakfast."""
01:16:04;01:16:10;"And then this is the moment that sealed the fate of this man and also everybody on Twitter"
01:16:10;01:16:14;"You wrote, ""You don't have to bring them into this, just because you forgot refrigerators"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"existed for a second there."""
01:16:16;01:16:19;"And I mean, when you're right, you're right This guy was talking nonsense"
01:16:19;01:16:26;"So I guess, when you had this exchange, had you already had some kind of like edgy replies"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"because that's where you were always allowed to have the most freedom?"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"Or was this the crossing of the Rubicon?"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"We had gradually worked up to that point."
01:16:33;01:16:37;"About a year prior to that, we'd had an exchange with someone"
01:16:37;01:16:42;"It was about Burger King, where Wendy's introduced the 4 for 4 meal"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"and then Burger King introduced a 5 for 4 meal"
01:16:45;01:16:50;"And they did a tweet that was like, ""5 for 4, because 5 is better than 4"""
01:16:50;01:16:56;"And we had decided internally that we were going to not address it at all, not say anything"
01:16:56;01:17:00;"But then people kept tagging Wendy's into this tweet"
01:17:00;01:17:04;"And someone said, ""Wendy's, what are you guys firing back?"""
01:17:04;01:17:09;"So I was in the middle of a meeting or something, and I just wrote back ""edible food"""
01:17:09;01:17:11;"And that one went super viral"
01:17:11;01:17:16;"But we had some moments like that in the lead up to this one"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"The one you just read that ended up on Anderson Cooper and stuff"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"When you're at the forefront of a conversation like that, as things start picking up"
01:17:23;01:17:27;"For you, did you start to identify more with Wendy's, the brand?"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"Did your egos merge?"
01:17:28;01:17:33;"Did it become a Donnie Brosco situation, which you're so deep into cover, you don't even know"
01:17:33;01:17:38;"Or I guess the departed, where you're so deep into undercover, you don't know up from down anymore"
01:17:38;01:17:43;"Did it reach a point where you and Wendy's just became one"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"And you were just like, ""F*** the haters"""
01:17:46;01:17:51;"Because the voice of Wendy's eventually became a little bit like, ""F*** you"""
01:17:51;01:17:55;"So I'm curious, did you always have a lightness about it or a sense of humor"
01:17:55;01:17:59;"Or did you occasionally come home and speak to a loved one and they were just like"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"""What's going on with you? You used to leave work at work"""
01:18:02;01:18:07;"""But now it's like, now I feel like you want to give me a savage clap back"""
01:18:07;01:18:11;"Tell us about the next phase, as things got hot"
01:18:11;01:18:15;"Well, so what immediately happened is that roast went viral"
01:18:15;01:18:19;"And people sort of started coming and they were like, ""Roast me, do me next"""
01:18:19;01:18:23;"And there were three of us at that time, we had sort of grown"
01:18:23;01:18:26;"There was one guy on the agency side and two of us internally at Wendy's"
01:18:26;01:18:31;"And we're all like, taking turns, replying to people, taking shifts at night"
01:18:31;01:18:34;"Like, I'll take the 1am shift, right?"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"Wow"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"Because we hadn't really planned for this"
01:18:38;01:18:42;"We were getting more tweets in 24 hours than we used to get in a month"
01:18:42;01:18:48;"But we also didn't want to stop replying to them because we were afraid it would stop"
01:18:48;01:18:52;"I can't speak for the other two, I know that I did sort of like"
01:18:52;01:18:56;"I was not getting enough sleep or spending enough time outside the internet"
01:18:56;01:19:03;"And I did like, because when you spend that much time inside of anyone's Twitter mentions"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"It is really not good for your brain"
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Right"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"And then eventually you chose to leave Wendy's?"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"You'd had enough?"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Yeah"
01:19:10;01:19:15;"So the frozen beef thing that went viral happened in January of 2017"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"And I left in like March or April of that year"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"When you left, did you know what you were going to get into?"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Or you just knew you needed to leave?"
01:19:22;01:19:26;"I knew I wanted to take like a month or two off, just to not do anything"
01:19:26;01:19:29;"I went to, this sounds so lame, I went to Joshua Tree"
01:19:29;01:19:32;"That's not lame at all, Joshua Tree rules"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"Jake is a big Joshua Tree fan"
01:19:34;01:19:37;"I feel like that's just such a cliche thing to say"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"Like I went to the desert to find myself"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"I went to Joshua Tree and then I went to Death Valley"
01:19:42;01:19:46;"Just to like be out where there were no people and not be on the internet for a while"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"Yeah I mean that's a hell of a 180"
01:19:48;01:19:53;"Just like Wendy's social media manager just like hundreds of thousands of tweets"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"Like every possible point of view and opinion just like yelling at you"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"And then just in the emptiness"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"Of Death Valley?"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Of America, yeah"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"Death Valley is no joke"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Oh it ruled"
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Yeah were you by yourself?"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"You just like solo camping?"
01:20:06;01:20:10;"Yeah I went by myself, I got like an Airbnb"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"And I came back and I freelanced for about a year"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"So really just like took on"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"Still in advertising stuff?"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Yeah marketing, advertising stuff"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"So I worked mostly just through like word of mouth and people I knew"
01:20:22;01:20:28;"Picked up some projects working with like non-profits and smaller businesses"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"A couple of like tech companies"
01:20:30;01:20:36;"And then I ended up at Postmates in San Francisco in early 2018"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"Which moved my family out to California"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"And then I was there for a little bit"
01:20:41;01:20:46;"But then I left to join a campaign to impeach the president"
01:20:46;01:20:52;"But then that campaign ended when the funder of the campaign decided to run for president"
01:20:52;01:20:56;"So then I ran social media for Tom Steyer's presidential campaign for like three months"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"Woah"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"Are you still working for Steyer?"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"No I left there in September"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"And that's when you started working for Bloomberg?"
01:21:05;01:21:12;"Yeah so you left Tom Steyer's campaign and"
01:21:12;01:21:15;"Took a couple months off and now I am like"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"I'm like eight days into a new job at"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"It's a company called Figma"
01:21:19;01:21:25;"They're a design tool that helps creative people make websites and apps and stuff"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"I think part of the reason that Jake and I"
01:21:26;01:21:31;"It's a topic that always comes up on this show because it's fascinating"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"On the one hand there are companies that use it"
01:21:34;01:21:37;"Marketing and advertising in such a craven way"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"That you do kind of feel like they are actively"
01:21:41;01:21:43;"Harshing out the environment we all live in"
01:21:43;01:21:46;"But then at the same time there's also a part"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"You know Jake's a painter"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"I'm a poet"
01:21:49;01:21:53;"And I think we also can see the art of it"
01:21:53;01:21:54;"To some extent"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"You know people who work in the commercial arts"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"We have more in common than we'd want to admit sometimes"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"With brands and brand Twitter and things like that"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"So I'm curious somebody who's been through so many things"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"So you were saying yes you've seen that dark side"
01:22:05;01:22:08;"But ultimately is it a"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"I guess it's just a tool that can be used for good or evil"
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Like how do you think of it?"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"The very simple answer to your question is that"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"I really hate marketing and advertising"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"I think the thing that really drew me to social media"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"Was that I like communities"
01:22:22;01:22:26;"I like figuring out what connects people"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"And what makes people tick"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"I don't necessarily like the aspect of that"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"Where I am trying to sell people s***"
01:22:32;01:22:35;"But coming from"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"I guess when I was"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"I grew up in like a really small town"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"In the middle of nowhere in Ohio"
01:22:39;01:22:42;"And most of my friends were in the internet"
01:22:42;01:22:43;"Like on the computer"
01:22:43;01:22:46;"And I guess that form of communication"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Has always been sort of second nature to me"
01:22:49;01:22:52;"And so I think just"
01:22:52;01:22:55;"This process of like seeking out like-minded people"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And finding new ways to connect with them"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"I think can be very meaningful"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"And I think as I've progressed in my career"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"I've tried to find a way to do that"
01:23:03;01:23:06;"That's not just like some craven way"
01:23:06;01:23:07;"Of getting people to buy more s***"
01:23:07;01:23:09;"But that is like"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"I don't know something that matters"
01:23:11;01:23:14;"Something that's like changing the world"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"Which sounds a little more noble"
01:23:16;01:23:19;"Than is realistic for most people"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Or like I don't know"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"In my new gig it's like"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Working with an artistic community"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"Instead of trying to like sell a cheeseburger"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"So I guess the answer to your question is"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"I think about it all the time, right?"
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I think about like"
01:23:31;01:23:34;"What am I doing working in advertising?"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"But then I also think about like"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"We all live under capitalism"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Like we all gotta make a living under capitalism"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"So maybe what I have to do is just like"
01:23:43;01:23:47;"Do my job while being the least disruptive"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"And not annoying as possible, right?"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"I know what you mean"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"The way that Mack from Pluckers put it is"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"It's a dumb time to be alive"
01:23:55;01:23:56;"[Laughter]"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"That's his catchphrase for how he answers"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"Difficult questions about how we all make our way through"
01:24:02;01:24:03;"This compromised world"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"I've had a thought recently"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"And you know, Jake and I have often"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"Talked so much about like"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Corporate social media"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"And the things about it that bother us"
01:24:11;01:24:12;"But I have had increasingly of this thought"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"As I kind of learn about"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Even more about this world we live in"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"And you learn about"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"There's a book that actually Obama put on his"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"End of the year book list that I was reading"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"Called The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"And it talks very specifically about"
01:24:26;01:24:29;"Facebook and Google and Amazon"
01:24:29;01:24:30;"And trying to"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"The woman wrote it, Shoshana Zuboff"
01:24:32;01:24:36;"She's trying to provide a framework and a vocabulary"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"For a way to understand something"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"That we all kind of understand"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"But it's complicated"
01:24:42;01:24:43;"And anyway, I guess what I'm saying is"
01:24:43;01:24:46;"The way she talks about surveillance capitalism"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"And the way that money is made based off our data"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"And our behavior on the internet"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"When you read about that stuff"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"And it's just like, it's so intense"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"It almost sometimes makes you think"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"You know what?"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"Trying to make somebody"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Laugh or get their attention"
01:24:59;01:25:00;"So they'll buy your cheeseburger"
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Seems quaint"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"[Laughter]"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"It seems kind of like straightforward and like"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Not that bad"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"You know what I mean?"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"Like, and"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Maybe that's just the trajectory we're on"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"As a country or a world"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"It's like as things just get harsher and harsher"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"You just look back to the previous era's harshness"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"And you're like, say what you will, but"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"[Laughter]"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"So it wasn't that bad"
01:25:20;01:25:21;"Three years ago? Not that crazy"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Well, thanks so much, Amy"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"And it's been great hearing your story"
01:25:26;01:25:28;"And it's a fascinating journey"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"And I hope you call back again"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Because, you know"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"As much as we like hearing the history of WEND"
01:25:32;01:25:35;"It's also cool just to hear your take on"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Some of the other social media happenings"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Yeah, thanks for having me on"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"Happy to do it again if you ever need"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"Thoughts on the internet"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Absolutely, well thanks so much, Amy"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Have a good one"
01:25:46;01:25:46;"Bye"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"Have a good one, bye"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"Let's get in the top five"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"This week's top five"
01:25:57;01:25:59;"We're going to compare the top five Billboard hits"
01:25:59;01:26:02;"This week in 2006"
01:26:02;01:26:05;"To the top five songs on Apple Music right now"
01:26:05;01:26:08;"The Apple Music Top 100 Global Chart"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Yeah, not iTunes"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"Nope"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"And it's not just domestic"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"It's just global streams"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"This is global"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"So we want to welcome our friends"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"From places like Mexico and Canada"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Why did we choose 2006?"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"I truly have no idea"
01:26:23;01:26:26;"I think it was the year that the Jet record came out"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"Oh right, in the review"
01:26:27;01:26:28;"Yes"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Okay, so this one's going out to Chris"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"So the number five song this week in 2006"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"Wow, this is really starting to feel like a"
01:26:35;01:26:38;"I mean, that's 14 years ago"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"But this feels like decades ago"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Nickelback, ""Photograph"""
01:26:47;01:26:48;"Yeah, I meant to ask Chris"
01:26:48;01:26:52;"If Pitchfork reviewed Nickelback"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"Because why were they reviewing Jet in the first place?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Jet was like close enough to"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Like stuff they would review"
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Huh"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Because they didn't review Nickelback, did they?"
01:27:01;01:27:02;"I don't think so"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"This band is kind of like"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"People used to hate on this band"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Well, this band's kind of like the Eagles in a way"
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Like widely loved and widely reviled"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"Yeah"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"I mean, this guy's vocal approach is insane"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Is it auto-tuned?"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"It's auto-tuned and like"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Is he harmonizing with himself or is it just double-tracked?"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"Or is this like octaves?"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"I just gotta with it up to this point"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"This is just too much"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Chad Kroger told CBC"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"It's just nostalgia growing up in a small town"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"And you can't go back to your childhood"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"Saying goodbye to friends that you've drifted away from"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"Where you grew up, where you went to school"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"Alright"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"That's what this song is about?"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"Yeah"
01:28:02;01:28:05;"I mean, it's kind of similar subject matter to"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"The beautiful R.E.M. song ""Night Swimming"""
01:28:07;01:28:08;"Because that's just like"
01:28:08;01:28:12;"Photograph on the dashboard"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Taken years ago"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"All I remember from that is the chorus"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"Night swimming deserves a quiet night"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"To me, that song is like evoking"
01:28:21;01:28:24;"Yeah, like a summer night in like your small town"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"So he's thinking back to those nights when they went night swimming?"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Yeah"
01:28:27;01:28:30;"And there's like a yellowed photograph of like his friends"
01:28:30;01:28:32;"On the dash"
01:28:32;01:28:32;"Oh"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"I could be wrong, but that's how I"
01:28:34;01:28:35;"Have always thought about night swimming"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"What's Def Leppard photograph about?"
01:28:38;01:28:38;"I think that's more"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"It's like a pinup girl or something?"
01:28:39;01:28:40;"I think so"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"That's a great song"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"That Def Leppard photograph"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I wanna touch you"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"Ah, photograph"
01:28:48;01:28:51;"The Chad Kroger guy kind of reminds me a little bit of like"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"The Def Leppard vocal sound"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Just like hyped up"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Yeah"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"Joe Elliott, the lead singer of Def Leppard described"
01:28:58;01:28:59;"Photograph being about quote"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"Something you can't ever get your hands on"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"Wow"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"That's deep"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"I guess there's a whole rich tradition of people"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"Writing songs about like photos, images"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"That's also interesting to think that"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"We're probably not gonna get as many good photograph songs in the future"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"Because it's"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"Just images on your phone"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Physical"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"I mean, somebody I could write"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"It would just have a different feeling of just like"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"Like one day, scrolled back too far"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"Now I'm looking at a pic from nine years ago"
01:29:28;01:29:31;"I haven't seen it in a few months"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"Hers is like"
01:29:32;01:29:35;"We were down at the lake shore"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I got an email from Facebook"
01:29:37;01:29:40;"Reminding me of some sh*t that happened in the past, man"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"I didn't wanna think about it, now I am"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"But there's something about like"
01:29:44;01:29:46;"The photograph is like this physical thing"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Immediate"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"I don't wanna say it's sad or"
01:29:48;01:29:50;"But it's like"
01:29:50;01:29:51;"It's more of this like pure metaphor"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Where it's like"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"The past is gone"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"There's no traces"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"All you have is this little square in your hand"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"You're holding this small little thing"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Which is like"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"Which is starting to yellow"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Yeah, like it's on its way out"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"And like, yeah"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Even this photo won't be around forever"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"No"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"There is something about just like"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"You're holding this tiny little piece of history"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"This tiny little fragile thing"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"Versus like"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Something you've like backed up to the cloud"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Plus like"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"You could like text other people just being like"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"Hey, you remember that night in '07?"
01:30:21;01:30:23;"We went swimming in the lake at night"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"I lost my phone"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Like I lost a lot of pictures"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"Just be like"
01:30:26;01:30:26;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"I'll go on the Facebook group and"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"Yeah, here's 30 other alternative angles"
01:30:31;01:30:31;"Yeah, dude"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Night swimming deserves a quiet night"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"Yeah"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"I agree"
01:30:36;01:30:36;"So anyway"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"I don't know, I guess"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Nickelback, very meaningful song"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"Made us think, man"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"So that song is kinda deep"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"I don't know about this song"
01:30:43;01:30:46;"We heard this for the first time on Time Crisis"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"There's gotta be more to this song"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"But this is a wild pop song"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Dance Monkey"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"Tones and I"
01:30:53;01:30:54;"I don't know what it is"
01:30:54;01:30:55;"This is a big hit"
01:30:55;01:31:00;"They say, oh my God"
01:31:00;01:31:00;"I see the way you shine"
01:31:00;01:31:01;"Oh, we've heard this before, right?"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"Yeah, remember?"
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Dance monkey, dance monkey"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"Take your hand, my D"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"And place them both in my"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"In my ear"
01:31:10;01:31:10;"Oh, that's right"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"This person was like a busker"
01:31:12;01:31:12;"Yeah, I guess"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"We read this, right?"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"Yeah, she lived in a van with her friends"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"I'd wake up at six"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Otherwise, I'd wake up in a ball of sweat"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"Then we'd go down to the beach or play basketball"
01:31:21;01:31:24;"And then go busk at night for like four or five hours"
01:31:24;01:31:24;"It was a good life"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"Sounds cool"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Everyone talks about how it must have been difficult"
01:31:27;01:31:27;"But it really wasn't"
01:31:27;01:31:30;"It was probably the best time I've ever had"
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Oh, alright"
01:31:31;01:31:32;"That's endearing"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"That's some summer '69 sh*t"
01:31:34;01:31:37;"I got my first real six string"
01:31:37;01:31:41;"Bought it at the five and dime"
01:31:41;01:31:44;"Living in a van playing basketball"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"The number four song back in '06"
01:31:46;01:31:49;"Mariah Carey, ""Don't Forget About Us"""
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Do I know this one?"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"Don't forget about us"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"Don't baby, no baby, don't forget about us"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go"
01:32:01;01:32:04;"She had a bunch of hits off this record"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"17th chart-topping single from Mariah Carey"
01:32:06;01:32:10;"Tying Elvis Presley for most number ones by a solo artist"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"And then she'd break it in 2008"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"That's insane"
01:32:14;01:32:20;"You know sometimes it be like that, baby"
01:32:20;01:32:23;"Now every time I see you"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Just a solid R&B song"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"I'm a Mariah Carey fan"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"Do you like Mariah Carey?"
01:32:27;01:32:28;"I do, actually"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"You know what I like about her, too?"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"She's kind of thin, she's not like Billy Joel"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"Just a real tri-state energy"
01:32:34;01:32:35;"You know what I mean?"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Is she Long Island just like Joel?"
01:32:37;01:32:37;"She's Long Island"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"Yeah"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"I don't get the specific tri-state energy, but"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"Maybe also because she used to go out with Derek Jeter and stuff"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Oh, that's right"
01:32:45;01:32:48;"And there's something about that that I can just picture that"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Like the Long Island girl who's just like"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"""Well, I'm dating a Yankee"""
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Like you see"
01:32:53;01:32:54;"That's really funny"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"She's tri-state energy for sure"
01:32:56;01:33:01;"The number four song right now on Apple Music"
01:33:01;01:33:06;"So this is a guy who recently just topped the Billboard charts, too"
01:33:06;01:33:07;"His name's Roddy Ricch"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"I only know one of his songs"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"It's not this one"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"But he actually stopped Justin Bieber"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"From going to number one on the Billboard this week"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"With his comeback single ""Yummy"""
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Which was widely panned"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Have you heard ""Yummy,"" Jake?"
01:33:18;01:33:18;"I have not heard ""Yummy"""
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Did you know that Bieber is back?"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"No"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"I heard he had Lyme disease"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Yeah, I guess he came out and he"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"That's what I heard recently"
01:33:27;01:33:27;"That's tough"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"That's intense"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"Chronic Lyme"
01:33:29;01:33:30;"That's brutal"
01:33:30;01:33:31;"Yeah"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"From what I know about it"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"And I've always been paranoid about getting it, you know"
01:33:35;01:33:36;"When I'm in a"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"Tri-state, dude"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"It's very tri-state"
01:33:39;01:33:40;"Lyme, Connecticut"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"That's right, it's from Lyme, Connecticut"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Wait, did I actually tell this story on TC?"
01:33:44;01:33:45;"I don't think I did"
01:33:45;01:33:46;"What's that?"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"I've always been so paranoid about"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"Because also growing up"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"The places that we would go on vacation"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"Would be like"
01:33:53;01:33:54;"Upstate New York or something"
01:33:54;01:33:54;"Sure, sure"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"So just tick country"
01:33:56;01:33:59;"And so I remember being a kid and like"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"Me and my sister going somewhere and just like"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"My mom always being like"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"The kids, you know, maybe we go with another family"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"And we're staying at somebody's house, upstate New York"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"The kids come in from playing and always be"
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Tick check"
01:34:10;01:34:10;"Oh yeah"
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Tick check"
01:34:11;01:34:11;"Sure"
01:34:11;01:34:12;"You know, so whatever, it's drilled into you"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"That you cannot get bit by a tick"
01:34:15;01:34:17;"And then when you ever see a tick on you"
01:34:17;01:34:18;"It's like you get stressed out"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"And then so I've had time"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"There's one time I went to Shelter Island"
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Which is like one of the most ticked out places on earth"
01:34:24;01:34:27;"That's out in between the two forks of Long Island"
01:34:27;01:34:28;"I just remember like getting back from that trip"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"And just like feeling crazy tired"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"And I just got it in my head"
01:34:31;01:34:32;"So I was like, you know, I'm going to the doctor"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"F*** this, I need to find out"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Didn't turn out to have Lyme disease"
01:34:35;01:34:39;"But then Vampire Weekend was doing our tech rehearsals"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"For Father of the Bride"
01:34:40;01:34:43;"You know, just like where you kind of get to go play"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"Off big speakers, make sure everything sounds right"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"Make sure the lighting rig works"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"And is programmed and the globe spins"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"All the, you know, making sure like the big show is ready"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"And we did it out in like semi-rural Connecticut"
01:34:56;01:34:57;"And so I was out there for a few days"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"And I remember like I came back to the city"
01:34:59;01:35:01;"And I was taking a shower"
01:35:01;01:35:04;"And I felt like this funny thing on my side"
01:35:04;01:35:05;"And I kind of was like flicking it"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"And then I felt like I watched something go down the drain"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"And then I looked back and I had this kind of like circular mark"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"And I was just like, damn it, it finally happened"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"So I'm like thinking about it, I'm like, you know what?"
01:35:14;01:35:14;"I feel okay, let's not"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"But I was like, then, you know, reading up like"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"Get all paranoid, this stuff can hit whenever"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"And it's funny, Jake, that you point out the Lyme, Connecticut"
01:35:21;01:35:24;"Because that's the thing I vaguely knew"
01:35:24;01:35:25;"But I didn't really think about it"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Or maybe I just, it sounded familiar"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"But it didn't cross my mind"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"And so I go to the doctor"
01:35:31;01:35:32;"They're like, what's up?"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"And I'm like, look, basically I feel like"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"Maybe I was bit by a tick"
01:35:35;01:35:37;"I got this circular thing"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"It looks kind of like a tick bite"
01:35:38;01:35:39;"They're like, well, do you feel weird?"
01:35:39;01:35:42;"And I was like, no, but, you know, I'm about to go on tour forever"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"And the idea that I didn't get this checked out"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"Like while I'm here"
01:35:47;01:35:49;"Feels like, I don't want to like in four months"
01:35:49;01:35:52;"Be feeling the symptoms of chronic Lyme disease"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"And then she's like, well, have you been anywhere rural?"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"And I was like, just a little bit"
01:35:55;01:35:56;"Like I wasn't in upstate New York"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"I wasn't out on Long Island"
01:35:57;01:36:00;"Because those are the places I associate the most with Lyme disease"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"I was like, I was in Connecticut a little bit"
01:36:01;01:36:04;"I was like, is there a lot of Lyme disease in Connecticut?"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"And she's like, well, it is named after old Lyme, Connecticut"
01:36:07;01:36:11;"I was like, say it ain't so doc"
01:36:11;01:36:15;"Anyway, the way I saw that Justin Bieber said he had Lyme disease"
01:36:15;01:36:21;"Was that his wife made a post that's like, hey guys, like Lyme disease is real"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Like I don't understand this Lyme"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Yeah, because I know that there's stuff like chronic fatigue syndrome"
01:36:25;01:36:29;"That people debate endlessly and people say, no, it's real"
01:36:29;01:36:30;"I have it, I suffer because of it"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"And people are like, oh, that's made up"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"But if Lyme disease, you can test for it"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"It's like you have it or you don't and it has symptoms"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"Like what's this like Lyme disease is a myth thing"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"I don't know"
01:36:39;01:36:42;"Maybe people are like extra skeptical of chronic Lyme disease"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"But it's like, why?"
01:36:43;01:36:49;"It's hard to attribute certain symptoms to definitively being attached to Lyme"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"I don't know"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Well, anyway, poor guy's got chronic Lyme disease"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"And people are trashing his new song"
01:36:54;01:36:58;"And he got bumped off the top by Roddy Ricch"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Maybe next time we'll play his song Yummy"
