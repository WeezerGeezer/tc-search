00:08;00:14;"Everyone's lying in bed, counting their candy, and listening to Apple Beats 1."
00:14;00:24;"Today I'm back in Los Angeles, joined by actress/writer Rashida Jones, and actor/writer Gerard Carmichael."
00:24;00:27;"You might know them from films and programs, but today I'll be taking them way outside"
00:27;00:32;"their comfort zone, as we discuss my favorite medium, music."

04:36;04:39;"Time Crisis."
04:39;04:45;"That was Naturally 7, with a beautiful a cappella rendition of the Rolling Stones song, ""As Tears Go By."""
04:45;04:47;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
04:47;04:48;"I'm your host, Ezra."
04:48;04:49;"This is our ninth episode."
04:49;04:50;"It's crazy."
04:50;04:55;"It's our first episode that doesn't have our usual co-hosts, Jake Longstreth, Despot Asher."
04:55;04:59;"But I'm very lucky, because I'm back in L.A., that I was able to call some friends."
04:59;05:02;"We have actress/writer Rashida Jones."
05:02;05:03;"What's up, Rashida?"
05:03;05:04;"What's up, Ezra?"
05:04;05:05;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
05:05;05:06;"Thank you."
05:06;05:08;"You're a Time Crisis alum."
05:08;05:11;"Yeah, I would say I'm top five."
05:11;05:13;"You're head of the Alumni Association."
05:13;05:14;"Kind of."
05:14;05:16;"When it comes to Time Crisis."
05:16;05:23;"And it's not just the two of us today, because there's a man that we were all doing karaoke with only a few weeks ago."
05:23;05:24;"One of the greatest moments of my life."
05:24;05:36;"Comedian, actor, I would say my favorite comedian and actor and writer and creator of his own show, which is called The Gerard Carmichael Show."
05:36;05:37;"The Carmichael Show."
05:37;05:38;"Just The Carmichael Show."
05:38;05:43;"But I'm a day one fan, because I was at the taping of the pilot."
05:43;05:44;"You were right there."
05:44;05:46;"And it used to be called Go Gerard Go."
05:46;05:48;"It was Go Gerard Go back when we were young."
05:48;05:49;"That's right."
05:49;05:51;"Were you like on the floor, like clapping?"
05:51;05:52;"Like, Go Gerard Go."
05:52;05:53;"No, you have to be very quiet."
05:53;05:56;"You might not know this, but when you're on a TV set, you've got to keep it real quiet."
05:56;05:58;"Teach me, Dad."
05:58;06:02;"You have to be very quiet on a TV set."
06:02;06:03;"I remember it was great."
06:03;06:09;"They had North Carolina themed food for the guests, because you're from North Carolina."
06:09;06:11;"Yeah, which kept everyone seated."
06:11;06:12;"That's what North Carolina is."
06:12;06:13;"Just napping."
06:13;06:14;"Yeah, just napping."
06:14;06:15;"Everyone's horizontal."
06:15;06:18;"It's in front of a live audience, though, right?"
06:18;06:19;"Live audience, yeah."
06:19;06:21;"You need people to laugh."
06:21;06:27;"Yeah, it's fun to have that reaction, and to be there, and just to have people to know"
06:27;06:29;"something works immediately."
06:29;06:30;"It's really, really fun."
06:30;06:34;"And the show's got, you're going to do a second season very soon?"
06:34;06:38;"Yeah, I'm calling it season one reloaded, because we did six episodes, and now we're"
06:38;06:39;"doing 13."
06:39;06:41;"But yeah, I'll say second."
06:41;06:44;"Let's say second, for legal purposes, let's say second."
06:44;06:47;"That was like Parks and Recreation was like that."
06:47;06:49;"Yeah, it started with just six episodes."
06:49;06:52;"And then it's just like, and now season two is like, all right, you say so."
06:52;06:53;"Yeah, fine."
06:53;06:59;"We're very lucky to have two very talented performers on the show, but also, this show's"
06:59;07:00;"primarily about music."
07:00;07:02;"I don't know if I told you guys that."
07:02;07:03;"I know."
07:03;07:04;"You guys know a bit about music."
07:04;07:05;"You're a big music fan."
07:05;07:06;"I love, I love."
07:06;07:08;"You and I have had some many, many long conversations about music."
07:08;07:09;"I texted you."
07:09;07:11;"I'm infatuated."
07:11;07:13;"I'm like a year late on New Dorp."
07:13;07:15;"I texted Ezra about New Dorp."
07:15;07:17;"I heard it like recently."
07:17;07:18;"Right, right."
07:18;07:20;"And then I just texted you."
07:20;07:22;"I was like, this is the greatest song of all time."
07:22;07:23;"You should know that."
07:23;07:29;"I just like, literally, like, if there's more than eight seconds of silence, it plays in"
07:29;07:30;"my head."
07:30;07:31;"Really?"
07:31;07:32;"Oh, wow."
07:32;07:33;"To go to?"
07:33;07:35;"It became like default song."
07:35;07:36;"Like, I'm just infatuated with it."
07:36;07:38;"Can we get it on the Carmichael show?"
07:38;07:39;"Absolutely."
07:39;07:40;"That could be the opening."
07:40;07:41;"The theme song."
07:41;07:46;"People are just like, they don't know what the, it's like, hey man."
07:46;07:50;"I had that with a song for like 15 years, where anytime there was empty space in my"
07:50;07:51;"head, the song would play."
07:51;07:52;"Really?"
07:52;07:53;"What was it?"
07:53;07:54;"The theme from Halloween?"
07:54;07:55;"No."
07:55;07:56;"What was it?"
07:56;07:57;"Total, Can't You See?"
07:57;07:58;"Oh my God."
07:58;08:00;"Wait, Can't You See remix or Can't You See?"
08:00;08:01;"Remix."
08:01;08:02;"Give me all the chicken."
08:02;08:05;"I mean, not as much like the rhyme, but just to."
08:05;08:06;"I'm humiliated."
08:06;08:07;"I don't know this song."
08:07;08:12;"Oh, Can't You See, Puff Daddy did the coolest dance and he just drops off and swings his"
08:12;08:13;"arms."
08:13;08:14;"All right."
08:14;08:17;"Well, I was, I was thinking maybe because it was just Halloween, we'd play a lot of"
08:17;08:20;"spooky music, but maybe we should just start with this."
08:20;08:21;"Yeah."
08:21;08:22;"Rashida, you want to, are we going to do the remix or what?"
08:22;08:23;"Remix."
08:23;08:24;"Definitely."
08:24;08:25;"Okay, you want to introduce it?"
08:25;08:26;"Yes."
08:26;08:29;"This is Total with the remix of Can't You See featuring Notorious B.I.G."
08:29;08:36;"Give me all the chicken head from Pasadena to Medina, bet big get in between your dents."
08:36;08:40;"Take the prognosis, doses, blends and bends like Twizzlers."
08:40;08:42;"Biggest hit into hurt, what's under that skirt?"
08:42;08:44;"Slow down, son, be chillin'."
08:44;08:46;"Who fillin' them with octane?"
08:46;08:48;"Got 'em gassed up, 'bout to get blasted up, son."
08:48;08:51;"The last one heard the muhfuck, brother, miss him."
08:51;08:54;"I seen it when he kissed him at the wake, made his body shake."
08:54;08:59;"She's the high guy in 850, I smoke ten, rap terror, full chrome and terrors."
08:59;09:05;"She's fly by the mirrors, the fifth is conspicuous, bad boy slipped in '95, ridiculous."
09:05;09:10;"My rap rhymes is like landmines, one step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room."
09:10;09:13;"To whom it may concern, Junior Mafia's the clique."
09:13;09:16;"I'm stuck, but have my honey's total budget."
09:16;09:24;"In the middle of the day now, baby, I seem to think of only you."
09:24;09:37;"Never thinkin' for a moment, baby, that you be thinkin' of me too."
09:37;09:46;"So I can wait for the day that we can be together."
09:46;09:49;"I can't let you walk away."
09:49;09:57;"Can't you see you and me were meant to be, oh baby."
09:57;10:01;"And there's nothing left to say."
10:01;10:05;"Can't you see what you do to me?"
10:05;10:08;"I love what's meant to be."
10:08;10:11;"Do you want it from me?"
10:11;10:16;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
10:16;10:19;"I love what's meant to be."
10:19;10:23;"Do you want it from me?"
10:23;10:30;"Every time I see you, I get this feeling."
10:30;10:32;"Oh yeah."
10:32;10:34;"Mm-hmm."
10:34;10:38;"Telling me you're the one."
10:38;10:42;"Oh, what a feeling."
10:42;10:44;"Hey."
10:44;10:45;"Let's go."
10:45;10:53;"I can't wait for the day that we can be together."
10:53;10:56;"I can't let you walk away."
10:56;11:02;"Can't you see you and me were meant to be, oh baby."
11:02;11:07;"And there's nothing left for me to say."
11:07;11:12;"Can't you see what you do to me?"
11:12;11:14;"I love what's meant to be."
11:14;11:17;"Do you want it from me?"
11:17;11:23;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
11:23;11:26;"I love what's meant to be."
11:26;11:29;"Do you want it from me?"
11:29;11:34;"Take me away, so far away."
11:34;11:37;"What would you do to me?"
11:37;11:45;"Oh, I want to be alone together."
11:45;11:48;"Somewhere just you and me."
11:48;11:51;"Oh, oh."
11:51;11:57;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
11:57;12:00;"I love what's meant to be."
12:00;12:02;"Do you want it from me?"
12:02;12:08;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
12:08;12:11;"I love what's meant to be."
12:11;12:13;"Do you want it from me?"
12:13;12:19;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
12:19;12:22;"I love what's meant to be."
12:22;12:25;"Do you want it from me?"
12:25;12:30;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
12:30;12:33;"I love what's meant to be."
12:33;12:36;"Do you want it from me?"
12:36;12:41;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
12:41;12:44;"I love what's meant to be."
12:44;12:47;"Do you want it from me?"
12:47;12:52;"Oh baby, can't you see what you do to me?"
12:52;12:57;"Oh baby."
12:57;13:23;"[instrumental]"
13:23;13:29;"This town is coming like a ghost town."
13:29;13:36;"All the clubs have been closed down."
13:36;13:42;"This town is coming like a ghost town."
13:42;13:46;"Bands won't play no more."
13:46;13:49;"Too much fighting on the dance floor."
13:49;14:18;"[instrumental]"
14:18;14:26;"Do you remember the condom days before the ghost town?"
14:26;14:32;"The sagging dance and the music playing in Alibu town."
14:32;15:00;"[instrumental]"
15:00;15:04;"This town is coming like a ghost town."
15:04;15:07;"Why mostly you fight against yourselves?"
15:07;15:10;"This town is coming like a ghost town."
15:10;15:13;"No barmen leaving the years on their shelves."
15:13;15:17;"This town is coming like a ghost town."
15:17;15:19;"No job to be found in this country."
15:19;15:26;"Can't no one earn more if you don't get your money."
15:26;15:52;"[instrumental]"
15:52;16:05;"[instrumental]"
16:05;16:07;"That was the specials with Ghost Town."
16:07;16:09;"I feel like because it was just Halloween,"
16:09;16:11;"it's worth doing a kind of spooky song."
16:11;16:14;"I mean, but to be fair, that song is actually about"
16:14;16:17;"racial tension in the 1980s UK, so."
16:17;16:19;"That's pretty spooky."
16:19;16:20;"Yeah."
16:20;16:22;"Kind of frightening."
16:22;16:24;"Yeah, frightening is probably more the right word,"
16:24;16:26;"but I mean it has an eerie feel."
16:26;16:29;"I think maybe now that Halloween's over and we're in November,"
16:29;16:32;"maybe today's show is not about spooky, it's about eerie."
16:32;16:34;"Because November is kind of, it's like,"
16:34;16:36;"people say that October is the spookiest month,"
16:36;16:39;"but it's not like the rest of fall is chill."
16:39;16:40;"Right."
16:40;16:41;"You know what I mean?"
16:41;16:42;"Yeah."
16:42;16:43;"October is kind of scary in itself."
16:43;16:45;"You know, people are starting to cover up more."
16:45;16:46;"You see fewer faces."
16:46;16:48;"People just walking around like, you know."
16:48;16:50;"Like New York, February is the scariest month."
16:50;16:51;"Oh yeah, it's frightening."
16:51;16:52;"Because people are just straight up like."
16:52;16:53;"Everyone looks like a criminal."
16:53;16:54;"Looking like they're going to rob somebody."
16:54;16:56;"Yes, everyone's like a criminal."
16:56;16:57;"Can't see anybody's eyes."
16:57;17:00;"Yeah, and so it's like, it is kind of scary."
17:00;17:01;"Do you celebrate Halloween?"
17:01;17:03;"Do you like do Halloween things?"
17:03;17:05;"I don't, it's not really my favorite thing."
17:05;17:07;"Not so much as I get older."
17:07;17:09;"I mean, every once in a while, I'll go to,"
17:09;17:11;"maybe I'll stop by a party or something."
17:11;17:13;"But also because I live in New York,"
17:13;17:15;"nobody comes trick or treating where I live."
17:15;17:17;"Oh man, first of all, that sounded,"
17:17;17:19;"that sounded like a threat."
17:19;17:21;"Don't come trick or treating."
17:21;17:22;"Don't start now."
17:22;17:23;"Nobody comes trick or treating."
17:23;17:24;"Well, no, well, first of all,"
17:24;17:27;"in New York, people do trick or treat sometimes."
17:27;17:29;"I mean, I grew up in the suburbs in Jersey,"
17:29;17:31;"but I do have a memory of going trick or treating"
17:31;17:33;"with a friend in the city when I was little."
17:33;17:35;"And we kept going into like bodegas"
17:35;17:36;"and asking the guy for candy."
17:36;17:37;"Yeah."
17:37;17:38;"He was like, no."
17:38;17:39;"And sometimes you go in,"
17:39;17:42;"my dad has like a lot of sad stories"
17:42;17:44;"in his apartment building in the Bronx"
17:44;17:46;"and not being, his parents wouldn't let him"
17:46;17:47;"leave the building."
17:47;17:48;"So just canvassing the build,"
17:48;17:50;"one building for all of Halloween."
17:50;17:51;"Really?"
17:51;17:52;"Yeah."
17:52;17:53;"But my, my building,"
17:53;17:54;"you need a key for the elevator."
17:54;17:55;"So yeah."
17:55;17:56;"Happy Halloween."
17:57;17:58;"Good luck."
17:58;17:59;"Good luck out there."
17:59;18:01;"I think you start celebrating it less"
18:01;18:02;"because you're an adult"
18:02;18:05;"and you start realizing how genuinely frightening life is."
18:05;18:06;"Right."
18:06;18:07;"So it was just like, oh yeah,"
18:07;18:09;"I don't need a day where we just pretend to be scared."
18:09;18:10;"It was like, oh yeah,"
18:10;18:12;"it's like frightening out there."
18:12;18:13;"Right."
18:13;18:14;"It's all around."
18:14;18:15;"It's a cold world."
18:15;18:16;"Totally."
18:16;18:19;"But now I feel like Halloween is really just about"
18:19;18:23;"being behind a mask so you can do kind of like dumb crap."
18:23;18:24;"Yeah."
18:24;18:25;"You know?"
18:25;18:26;"Yeah."
18:26;18:28;"I feel like I go to parties and people are acting crazy"
18:28;18:29;"because they don't,"
18:29;18:31;"they feel not responsible for their behavior that night."
18:31;18:34;"Dancing and expressing feelings about."
18:34;18:36;"Wait, I was not, no, that sounds real tame."
18:36;18:38;"That's the bold thing I would do behind a mask."
18:38;18:40;"I was just like, all right, man,"
18:40;18:42;"let's go express all of my feelings."
18:42;18:45;"Take somebody into a corner and just let them know it's on your mind."
18:45;18:46;"I never really liked you."
18:46;18:47;"I tried."
18:47;18:48;"I tried really, really hard."
18:48;18:49;"Right."
18:49;18:50;"Like I really tried."
18:50;18:52;"I'm there, you're in front of me."
18:52;18:53;"I'm like, like this person."
18:53;18:55;"He was like nice, nice guy."
18:55;18:57;"I said, I said, I got, okay."
18:57;18:58;"I just got an idea."
18:58;18:59;"Elevator pitch."
18:59;19:00;"We're out here in Hollywood."
19:00;19:02;"A movie starring Drodd Carmichael."
19:02;19:04;"That's like the purge, but for emotions."
19:04;19:05;"Oh my God."
19:05;19:06;"Write that down."
19:06;19:09;"I almost want you to take that off just so no one can."
19:09;19:10;"Where does this air?"
19:10;19:12;"I got a few days to write a pitch."
19:12;19:14;"You got a few days to write it."
19:14;19:16;"The 24 hours once a year."
19:16;19:17;"You're allowed to keep it real."
19:17;19:19;"Oh, that's perfect."
19:19;19:20;"That's great."
19:20;19:21;"That's perfect."
19:21;19:22;"I love that."
19:22;19:23;"I could really see you in that."
19:23;19:24;"That's a great vehicle for you."
19:24;19:25;"Just going to just being very,"
19:25;19:26;"cause it's always this weird gray area."
19:26;19:28;"I think most people."
19:28;19:31;"Maybe you need to reclaim Halloween as your holiday where you just like,"
19:31;19:32;"tell people how you feel about things."
19:32;19:33;"Yeah."
19:33;19:35;"I'll tell them emotions that frighten me."
19:35;19:37;"Emotional Halloween."
19:37;19:38;"Emotional Halloween."
19:38;19:40;"What's your next HBO standup special?"
19:40;19:41;"Emotional Halloween."
19:41;19:43;"Oh, that's exactly what it is."
19:43;19:48;"I just spent six hours with my father."
19:48;19:51;"And then when I was 11, it was like, all right, we get it."
19:51;19:53;"I made a lot of mistakes."
19:53;19:55;"All right, let's get back into some more November music."
19:55;19:57;"It's not spooky."
19:57;19:58;"It's eerie."
19:58;20:01;"Here's Laurie Anderson with Oh Superman."
21:05;21:09;"Hi, I'm not home right now."
21:09;21:11;"But if you want to leave a message,"
21:11;21:14;"just start talking at the sound of the tone."
21:17;21:25;"Hello?"
21:25;21:27;"This is your mother."
21:27;21:29;"Are you there?"
21:29;21:31;"Are you coming home?"
21:35;21:42;"Hello?"
21:42;21:44;"Is anybody home?"
21:44;21:50;"Well, you don't know me."
21:50;21:54;"But I know you."
21:54;22:00;"And I've got a message."
22:01;22:04;"To give to you."
22:04;22:09;"Here come the planes."
22:09;22:20;"So you better get ready."
22:20;22:23;"Ready to go."
22:23;22:28;"You can come as you are."
22:29;22:32;"Pay as you go."
22:32;22:37;"Pay as you go."
22:37;22:55;"And I said, ""Okay, who is this really?"""
22:57;23:00;"And the voice said,"
23:00;23:05;"""This is the hand."
23:05;23:09;"The hand that takes."
23:09;23:16;"This is the hand."
23:16;23:22;"The hand that takes."
23:26;23:29;"This is the hand."
23:29;23:34;"The hand that takes."
23:34;23:40;"Here come the planes."
23:40;23:45;"They're American planes."
23:45;23:48;"Made in America."
23:48;23:51;"Smoking or non-smoking."
23:51;23:54;"Ha, ha, ha."""
23:55;23:57;"You're listening to"
23:57;23:59;"Time Crisis"
23:59;24:01;"on Beats 1."
24:01;24:03;"That was Laurie Anderson with ""Oh, Superman."""
24:03;24:05;"So, Jara, you said that reminded you"
24:05;24:07;"of something that you've found out"
24:07;24:09;"by experimenting with Prince's music."
24:09;24:13;"Yes, as every young man should in his adolescence."
24:13;24:15;"You should all experiment with Prince's music."
24:15;24:18;"And Darlin' Nicky, it hit that, ""Ha, ha, ha."""
24:18;24:21;"And then he goes into this sound that sounds weird,"
24:21;24:24;"but if you reverse it, he's singing,"
24:24;24:26;"""Hello, how are you? I'm fine,"
24:26;24:28;"because I know the Lord is coming soon,"""
24:28;24:30;"which is interesting, given the lyrics."
24:30;24:32;"Wow, Prince is a complex man."
24:32;24:33;"Yeah."
24:33;24:35;"To me, sex and religion aren't opposites."
24:35;24:37;"No, sex is religion."
24:37;24:39;"I was waiting for it."
24:39;24:41;"It is. I'm sorry."
24:41;24:44;"You guys are telling me I was coming to church."
24:44;24:45;"Sex is religion."
24:45;24:46;"You know, that's funny,"
24:46;24:48;"because that leads me nicely into the next song,"
24:48;24:51;"and I was thinking about kind of November-ish songs."
24:51;24:54;"I was thinking about songs from the early '90s."
24:54;24:57;"My parents didn't get cable until the late '90s."
24:57;25:00;"So unfortunately, I missed out on a lot of good MTV."
25:00;25:02;"When I got into MTV, it was 1998."
25:02;25:05;"It was a very dark time. I'm not going to name names."
25:05;25:08;"So in the early '90s, that was a brutal time for MTV."
25:08;25:11;"But in the early '90s, I'd occasionally be at friends' house,"
25:11;25:14;"and when I'd see a video once, it would stick with me,"
25:14;25:16;"because I didn't see music videos that much."
25:16;25:19;"I'd listen to the song, and it's such a weird song."
25:19;25:20;"It's so powerful and emotional,"
25:20;25:23;"and it really reminds me of autumn on the East Coast,"
25:23;25:25;"and it's Meat Loaf."
25:25;25:26;"I Would Do Anything for Love."
25:26;25:27;"You guys remember this song?"
25:27;25:28;"Yeah."
25:28;25:30;"I remember the song. I don't remember the video."
25:30;25:31;"I do."
25:31;25:32;"It was like Beauty and the Beast."
25:32;25:33;"Yes."
25:33;25:34;"Oh, I do remember the video."
25:34;25:35;"Candleabras and pianos."
25:35;25:37;"You know who else did a video like that?"
25:37;25:38;"It was Celine Dion."
25:38;25:40;"She did the song, um..."
25:40;25:42;"♪ Can you touch me like this? ♪"
25:42;25:43;"Isn't that Meat Loaf?"

31:12;31:14;"Do you guys know what he's talking about?"
31:14;31:16;"'Cause I remember being a kid,"
31:16;31:19;"and there was some discussion in the schoolyard."
31:19;31:21;"Meatloaf would do anything for love, but he won't do that."
31:21;31:23;"He never clearly says what that is."
31:23;31:25;"Like a certain sexual position."
31:25;31:28;"I mean, that's low-hanging fruit."
31:28;31:29;"Yeah. Right?"
31:29;31:32;"Which is also a certain sexual position."

32:24;32:25;"""I'm not doing it."" That would be my response."
32:25;32:27;"That's why I feel like the song is so autumnal,"
32:27;32:29;"because it's about apple picking."
32:29;32:30;"I'll do anything for love."
32:30;32:32;"Mostly, and it's settled."
32:32;32:35;"What is that? I wanna know what that is now."
32:35;32:37;"I also kinda remember in the early '90s,"
32:37;32:41;"if you remember, that was the peak or the beginning"
32:41;32:43;"of real safe sex education."
32:43;32:45;"So there was a lot of talk--"
32:45;32:47;"I mean, not that safe sex has gone out of style,"
32:47;32:48;"but I'm just saying back then,"
32:48;32:50;"that was the height of the AIDS epidemic."
32:50;32:52;"Everybody's talking about safe sex."
32:52;32:54;"Everybody's like, ""All right, we gotta teach kids about condoms"
32:54;32:55;"""really early."""
32:55;32:58;"So I kinda remember having this slight feeling,"
32:58;33:00;"because I was getting-- at 7 years old or whatever,"

33:02;33:03;"""I gotta use condoms."""
33:03;33:04;"Really?"
33:04;33:05;"Yeah, I wasn't having sex then,"
33:05;33:06;"but everybody told me I had to use condoms."
33:06;33:08;"In fact, I have a memory of being a kid"
33:08;33:12;"over at some--like, a fellow liberal family's household,"
33:12;33:14;"and I heard a kid, my fellow kid who was 7,"
33:14;33:16;"say to his mom in the kitchen--"
33:16;33:17;"and my head was about to explode--"
33:17;33:21;"say, ""Hey, Mom, I'm gonna have sex later."""
33:21;33:24;"And I remember being like, ""Oh, my God."""
33:24;33:26;"And I remember she looked at him and said,"
33:26;33:28;"""Well, I hope it's safe sex."""
33:28;33:29;"Wow."
33:29;33:32;"This is like some classic, like, liberal suburb stuff."
33:32;33:33;"But anyway, you're always talking about safe sex,"
33:33;33:35;"so I always kind of assumed that I would do anything for love,"
33:35;33:36;"but I won't do that."
33:36;33:38;"I won't go Jimmy-less."
33:38;33:40;"'Cause he's talking-- yeah, I wouldn't go Jimmy-less."
33:40;33:42;"That's the real '90s parlance."
33:42;33:43;"Jimmy Hat."
33:43;33:47;"Love--I don't get enough of it."
33:47;33:48;"Yeah, I was confused about that."
33:48;33:50;"Is a Jimmy a penis or a condom?"
33:50;33:51;"I don't know."
33:51;33:52;"I mean, I think Jimmy's probably a penis,"
33:52;33:54;"but it probably is short for Jimmy Hat, too, right?"
33:54;33:55;"Yeah, yeah."
33:55;33:56;"Or Jimmy Cap."
33:56;33:57;"Oh, you know what?"
33:57;33:59;"This is a song that also reminds me of autumn."
33:59;34:01;"This reminds me of autumn when I was in high school."
34:01;34:04;"When would I--I don't know, maybe a freshman or something."
34:04;34:06;"This song is very autumnal to me,"

53:26;53:30;"There's def--we've definitely had the siblings."

54:02;54:03;"- Pop Staples. - Pop--"
54:03;54:05;"- Davis and-- - Wait, was he the dad?"

55:03;55:05;"This one could be an October song,"

55:14;55:15;"- Wow."
55:15;55:18;"- I think you guys know what I'm talking about."
55:18;55:20;"It's the rain. - Yep."

01:05:55;01:05:57;"Zack. I don't know about Zackistan, man."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"- Zackistan. - You're right. You make a good point."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"You gotta-- if you're gonna start a country,"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"you gotta mean it."
01:06:03;01:06:06;"Well, also, it should be noticed that it has ""Zack"" as staying with a Q."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"All right, because this guy, we should point out,"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"his name is Zack Landsberg."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"- Z-A-Q. - Yes."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- Yeah. - We're just already set up for Philly."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"You think it's not gonna happen?"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"- 'Cause of the Q? - Because of the Q."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"- Yeah, with a C? Maybe. - Maybe."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"- We'll see. - Maybe. Right."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"- But Z-A-Q-- - No chance. No chance."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"- There's no chance. - Okay."

01:06:36;01:06:40;"to start their own countries in various parts of the U.S."

01:06:44;01:06:46;"- I'm so sorry. - Yeah, thank you."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"- Oh, wow. - Well, no, I just mean, like,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"because I was born in 1984,"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"I can't remember the Reagan years at all."

01:06:56;01:06:59;"And people always claim that when there's a Democratic president,"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"that's when the white supremacist militias really start getting itchy."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- Yeah. - So in the Clinton years,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"there was a lot of talk about militias."
01:07:06;01:07:09;"So I remember, like, right when I first started, like, hearing the news,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"when I was, like, 8 or 9, a lot of talk about that."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"And then, of course, since Obama's been president,"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"you're always seeing something about, like,"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"these guys who are trying to, like, build their own country"
01:07:18;01:07:21;"or they're gonna get in a fight with, like, the U.S. military or something."
01:07:21;01:07:25;"- I would like for everyone to see the U.S. military once."

01:07:32;01:07:35;"I think, like, if I'm building a coffee table from Ikea,"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"I should see what it should look like."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"And if you see the U.S. military"
01:07:40;01:07:44;"and you don't think your militia could even kind of compete,"
01:07:44;01:07:49;"maybe, I don't know, take up, like, baking or something, like, more calming."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"- Well, you know what? That's what they said to the American revolutionaries"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"who founded this country. - Yeah, true."
01:07:54;01:07:57;"But that was a different time when, like-- - That was a different time."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"- That was a different time when, like, everyone's guns were equal."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"- You know, like, when, like-- - A time before drones."
01:08:03;01:08:06;"- Yeah, we think about it as if, like, even the biggest machine gun"
01:08:06;01:08:09;"is just like, yeah, you're not even gonna be fighting human beings."
01:08:09;01:08:12;"Like, your militia's not-- you'll never even see it."

01:10:33;01:10:35;"- All right, let's get into some more New York news."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"A lot of news coming out of Brooklyn,"
01:10:37;01:10:41;"which I'm ashamed to say is becoming a national joke."
01:10:41;01:10:44;"[laughter]"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"The proud borough where people like Spike Lee,"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"Bernie Sanders, Notorious B.I.G.,"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"Barbara Streisand, the list goes on."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"- That's Mount Rushmore. - Yes."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"- Really? - That's the Brooklyn route."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"- Mount Rushmore. - I mean, it's a proud borough."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"You know, almost everybody in America has some Brooklyn heritage."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- What? - Yeah."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"- In, like, an Ellis Island way? - In, like, an Ellis Island way."
01:11:05;01:11:09;"One in four Americans can trace their heritage somehow through Brooklyn."
01:11:09;01:11:12;"- Wow. Great statistic. - You must have some Brooklyn ancestors."
01:11:12;01:11:17;"- I'm sure, yeah. I mean, I know I have, like, city ancestors, so yeah, probably."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"- Brooklyn is a proud borough."
01:11:19;01:11:24;"These days, when you go talk about Brooklyn to people around the country,"
01:11:24;01:11:28;"the first thing they think of is no longer Bernie Sanders and Notorious B.I.G."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"You know what they think of? - What?"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"- Goofball. - [bleep]"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"[laughter]"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"- People--I'm just saying. I'm not judging,"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"but that's what people think about."
01:11:38;01:11:43;"So some of the news coming out is that New York lands"
01:11:43;01:11:46;"its first certified organic craft beer."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"- Oh, yay. - Which sounds like not a bad idea,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"but basically our producer, Colin, is making the point"
01:11:50;01:11:53;"that last time we were talking about these juice crawls,"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"now we're talking about this beer."
01:11:55;01:11:59;"And it's--again, I'm not dissing it, but it's in a way Brooklyn has come"
01:11:59;01:12:06;"to embody these kind of frivolous, health-conscious fads"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"in a way that L.A. once did."
01:12:08;01:12:11;"- You have to add the word ""hipster"" in there if you're going to talk about it."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- I don't like using the word ""hipster."" - Why?"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"- It's derogatory towards myself."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"[laughter]"
01:12:18;01:12:21;"- I don't subscribe to self-hate."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"- And I'm not a self-hater."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"I mean, hipster is anybody but you."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"- I mean, I'm a hipster. We're hipsters, right?"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"- Are you guys hipsters? - I guess."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"- Here's the thing. I don't--like, certain things, I didn't--"
01:12:32;01:12:35;"I skipped certain waves. Like, records, I don't subscribe--"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"I don't play records. I'm like, you know, there's a better quality--"
01:12:38;01:12:41;"we have on beats right now. I would like to hear music"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"the clearest way I could--like, technology is advanced."
01:12:44;01:12:47;"It's like going to the doctor and being leeched."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"This is what listening to a record is like."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"- That might happen in Brooklyn. - That may happen in Brooklyn."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"It's like, you know, they have a better version of this now."
01:12:53;01:12:57;"I would love to do another pitch. - Yeah."
01:12:57;01:13:01;"- I would love to do, like, Rip Van Winkle, Brooklyn,"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"where there's a guy who takes a nap for 25 years in Brooklyn"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"and he wakes up and he has to figure out, you know,"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"what Brooklyn has become."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"- Was he, like, a fishmonger before he went to sleep or something?"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"- He was a fishmonger and he woke up and now he's being told"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"he needs a favorite juice. - It was like--it was like"
01:13:16;01:13:21;"a lesser member of Junior Mafia goes to sleep in 1993."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"- Lil' Cease falls asleep in 1993."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"Lil' Cease wakes up. He wakes up."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"- In the same spot. - Same spot."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"- Exact same spot. - It's the same block in Bed-Stuy."
01:13:30;01:13:35;"- Yes. He wakes up, but this time it's, like, organic,"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"like, vitamin B, like, B12 shots."
01:13:38;01:13:42;"- Well, anyway, I'm not gonna diss people who want organic beer."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Everybody should drink organic beer."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"If you're gonna drink beer, I do tequila shots"

01:13:51;01:13:53;"How about one last piece of New York news?"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Adele is gonna appear on Saturday Night Live"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"for the first time since 2008."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"You guys know Adele? [laughter]"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"- That's a crazy question."
01:14:02;01:14:05;"- Adele's on the same record label as Lil' Vampire Weegan."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- That's--that's so cool. - Oh, that's dope."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"- Thank you. [laughter]"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"- I love how you made this about you."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Wait, is she hosting or singing?"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"- Um, she is saying hello."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"That's what it says. On New York Daily News it says,"

01:14:22;01:14:24;"for the first time in seven years."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"She will appear as the show's musical guest on November 21."""
01:14:26;01:14:29;"- Great. - So I got something I gotta get off my chest."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"- Yeah. - Adele is not 25."
01:14:32;01:14:34;"- Mm-hmm. - Really? - Okay?"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"And I can't stand-- - You heard that here first?"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"- The mainstream media is always propagating lies."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"And one of them is that Adele is the same age"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"as whatever her last album was."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"That's not how it works. Every year she turns a different age."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"- What? - Just like you, just like me. - Nah."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- She's a human being, and every year she turns--"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"every 12 months, give or take, she turns a new age."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"- Give or take. No, it's not. - But I feel like a lot of these--"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- Don't give. - I'm sorry, but I think a lot of these"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"so-called pundits in the mainstream media,"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"they act as if Adele was 19 for two years."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"- Yeah. - And then she was 21..."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"- Yes. - For three years, and now she's 25."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"Well, guess what, guys? Adele's 27."
01:15:08;01:15:10;"- Whoa. - Wow."
01:15:10;01:15:13;"- Adele was born May 5, 1988, in Tottenham, London."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"- (laughs) - That's a neighborhood in London,"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"in the U.K. She's 27 years old."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"- I'm shocked right now. - Yeah. - I'm shocked."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"- Well, listen, guys, she calls the album"
01:15:23;01:15:27;"""However Old She Was""... - When she made the album."
01:15:27;01:15:30;"- When she first got an idea for a sick beat for the album."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"- Right. - That's how old she is."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- So this is a sick beat. - From conception of sick beat."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"- So if she-- - The first time she beatboxes."
01:15:36;01:15:40;"The implication that Adele is 25, 12 months past,"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"then she's still 25, that's not right."
01:15:42;01:15:44;"She's 27, and the album's called ""25"""
01:15:44;01:15:47;"because that's how old she was when she first laid down"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"the first beatbox for the record."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"- It has a better ring. It has a better ring, 25 than 27."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"For an album."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"- Although 27's a very famous musical age."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"- Yeah, I don't think you want to name the album ""27."""
01:15:58;01:16:00;"- Yeah, it's not-- - It's just a bunch of dead artists."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"- Yeah, it's not great. - Forever 27. - Yeah, it's like,"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"""Yeah, 25."" - All right, let's get back"

01:24:00;01:24:03;"Song was a little bit spooky, certainly eerie."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"Are you guys ready for the ultimate time crisis tradition?"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"Rashid has done this once, Jeraud, you've never done this before."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Very excited."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"This is when we go through the top five songs on iTunes."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"Brow!"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Hold on, I'll play the drop for you."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"That wasn't it?"
01:24:17;01:24:24;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:24:24;01:24:28;"This is very exciting because now we've been listening to the same songs all summer."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Now it's finally a new season."
01:24:30;01:24:34;"It's autumn, and I think we have just about a full list of new songs."
01:24:34;01:24:38;"So we finally can traverse the pop cultural landscape in a new way."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"So here's what we're going to do."
01:24:39;01:24:40;"We're going to count down the top five songs."
01:24:40;01:24:43;"We're just going to talk about them, talk about what they mean to us,"
01:24:43;01:24:46;"what they say about the cultural moment."
01:24:46;01:24:51;"And the number five song is by a guy who's really been coming back hard this year."
01:24:51;01:24:59;"He's a kid out of Canada called Justin Bieber, and this is his song, ""What Do You Mean?"""
01:24:59;01:25:10;"I'm realizing I don't know how many of the top five I've heard."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"That was Justin Bieber with ""What Do You Mean?"""
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Love it."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"You never heard that song before?"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"This is my first time listening to ""What Do You Mean?"""
01:26:04;01:26:05;"What do you think?"
01:26:05;01:26:10;"It's not about closing time at a club or a bar."
01:26:10;01:26:14;"And it's in reference to a very intoxicated girl."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"Really?"
01:26:15;01:26:16;"That doesn't make sense."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"I think that's what I interpret it."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"Because I've said that."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"What do you mean?"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"What are you saying to me right now?"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Oh, you mean literally what are you saying?"
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Like a literal what do you mean?"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"What are the words that you're saying?"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"What words, what emotion are you trying to get?"
01:26:28;01:26:31;"I think just the situation is like, that's how I interpret it."
01:26:31;01:26:34;"There's been a lot of talk about what that song is about."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Well, yeah, because some people have been offended by the song."
01:26:36;01:26:44;"Their interpretation was that it's that classic, oh, like people can't accept the fact that no means no."
01:26:44;01:26:48;"So he's trying to be like, wait, were you telling me that you want to make love or you don't want to make love?"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"What do you mean?"
01:26:49;01:26:53;"And you know, at a moment when everybody's kind of like, you know, no means no, Justin."
01:26:53;01:27:03;"Some other people were saying that it's a consent song that like it's actually he's trying to ask for consent and doesn't want to do it until he gets consent."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"Seems to search for clarity. Yeah."
01:27:05;01:27:13;"And as we all know, if the answer to what do you mean is, then you don't have, then you say you do not have consent."
01:27:13;01:27:15;"So nobody's having sex in the song is what you're saying."
01:27:15;01:27:18;"One would hope. Well, he does say we make in love all day."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Wait, no, we argue all day, make in love all night."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Also, I mean, I don't know. I don't know."
01:27:23;01:27:27;"I like to see it as a follow up to Kanye's Drunk and Hot Girls."
01:27:27;01:27:32;"What do you mean? What are you saying? What are you saying?"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"I'm going to I'm going to go. Yeah."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"As long as it ends with I'm going to go. Yeah."
01:27:36;01:27:40;"Then we can be done. I'm going to go."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"Yeah, I'm going to go. I can't."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"I wake up early."
01:27:44;01:27:49;"The next song is by an artist that I'm not familiar with, El King, but we have a little bit of background info on her."
01:27:49;01:27:53;"She's an American singer, songwriter, actress and the daughter of comedian Rob Schneider."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"Oh, and former model London King."
01:27:56;01:28:01;"Well, Rob Schneider is old enough to have a daughter that has a single."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"I mean, come on. Rob Schneider has been around for a long time."
01:28:04;01:28:07;"And I mean, come on, Deuce Bigalow gets around."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"All right. All right."
01:28:09;01:28:14;"All right. Let's see. Let's check it out. El King, El Schneider King, X's and O's."
01:28:14;01:28:20;"I have me a boy."
01:28:20;01:28:25;"I'm in. I showed him all the things that he didn't understand."
01:28:25;01:28:29;"And then I let him go."
01:28:29;01:28:34;"Now, there's one in California."
01:28:34;01:28:49;"I'm a."
01:28:49;01:28:54;"To me, because I'm the best baby that they never got to keep one, two, three."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"They're gonna run back to me."
01:28:56;01:29:17;"They always want to come, but they never want to leave."
01:29:17;01:29:24;"That was El King with X's and O's. X's as in X lovers."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"OK. I like that song."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"What are the O's for? I guess O's like the orgasms."
01:29:30;01:29:34;"Sounds. Well, it's spelled O.H."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"You get this. Those of X."
01:29:37;01:29:40;"I wasn't going to not do that."
01:29:40;01:29:44;"I was always going to have to do that."
01:29:44;01:29:48;"I mean, I liked it. It's that sounded like Black Keys."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"Yeah. Need some."
01:29:50;01:29:54;"She's a cool, raspy country rock voice."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Unique voices are back, you guys."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Yeah, that's good. Are they?"
01:29:58;01:30:01;"I'd like. Well, I think a certain like Sylvan Esso and like."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"OK. Maybe maybe unique voices are back."
01:30:03;01:30:05;"Well, congrats to El King. Yeah."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"And to Rob Schneider and London King."
01:30:08;01:30:12;"Although, actually, I don't want to speculate on people's relationships with their family."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"Let's forget the parents for a second. El King's is all about you."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Well done. You're in the iTunes top five."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"Yeah. Number three, this song we've heard before."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"Remember Drake? Yeah."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"Drake with Hotline Bling."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"You used to call me on my cell phone."
01:30:29;01:30:33;"You used to. You used to. You used to. You used to."
01:30:33;01:30:38;"You used to. Yeah. Yep."
01:30:38;01:30:42;"You used to call me on my cell phone."
01:30:42;01:30:46;"Late night when you need my love."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Call me on my cell phone."
01:30:49;01:30:53;"Late night when you need my love."
01:30:53;01:30:56;"And I know when that hotline bling."
01:30:56;01:31:00;"That can only mean one thing."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"I know when that hotline bling."
01:31:03;01:31:06;"That can only mean one thing."
01:31:06;01:31:10;"Ever since I left the city, you."
01:31:10;01:31:13;"Got a reputation for yourself."
01:31:13;01:31:17;"Everybody knows and I feel left out."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out."
01:31:20;01:31:24;"'Cause ever since I left the city, you."
01:31:24;01:31:27;"Started wearing less and going out more."
01:31:27;01:31:31;"Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor."
01:31:31;01:31:35;"Hanging with some girls I never seen before."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"You used to call me on my cell phone."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Okay, there's a lot to talk about here. Crazy."
01:31:38;01:31:42;"'Cause, so first of all, Drake made a big push to get this song to number one."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"It didn't happen."
01:31:43;01:31:46;"And actually I was kind of moved by it because on Instagram, Drake said,"
01:31:46;01:31:50;"""I don't ask for a lot. I'm just a humble rapper from Canada."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"But I've never had a number one song."""
01:31:52;01:31:53;"I mean, which is crazy."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"Oh really? That's crazy."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"He's never had a number one."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"I mean, and this is a guy who is like the king of the charts."
01:31:57;01:32:01;"Well, at any point he has number two through like 11."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Right."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"So it's like he doesn't have number one, but he has the rest of the songs."
01:32:05;01:32:06;"Right."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"But it's meaningful to him."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"It's symbolic. He never had number one."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"He said, ""Guys, it would mean so much to me if I could go number one."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"I could taste that success just once in my life."
01:32:14;01:32:17;"And it would especially mean a lot to me if it happened in October"
01:32:17;01:32:20;"because he calls all his stuff October's very own."""
01:32:20;01:32:21;"That's a tough break for Drake."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"Yeah, that is."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"Having a hard time feeling bad for Drake."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"I'm trying, 'cause I love his music, but I'm having a very difficult time."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"He's okay. He's all right."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"We should start a Kickstarter or a GoFundMe."
01:32:34;01:32:40;"I've never rebelled and then come around on an artist more than Drake."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"Never rebelled harder."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"You used to hate on Drake."
01:32:43;01:32:45;"Well, yeah, 'cause it was like--"
01:32:45;01:32:49;"Well, he was introduced to me in a very specific way that I think was wrong."
01:32:49;01:32:52;"Someone, my friend was like, ""You got to listen to this new Drake dude."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"He's like the Mill Lauryn Hill."""
01:32:54;01:32:56;"And I was like, ""The Mill Lauryn Hill?"""
01:32:56;01:32:57;"And I rushed home."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"And I was like, ""All of it."""
01:32:59;01:33:03;"And then just because that's not how you should first hear Drake."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"That's not who Drake is."
01:33:04;01:33:05;"So I rebelled for like five years."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"I was like, ""No, no Drake."""
01:33:07;01:33:11;"And then I heard it and I was like, ""Oh, yeah, I actually think I love all of his music."""
01:33:11;01:33:16;"I think Drake's done an amazing job of slowly but surely winning people over."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Yeah, he's a likable guy."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"I mean, that's what happens over the course of a year."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"You win people over and you alienate other people."
01:33:21;01:33:25;"I cannot get enough Hotline Bling memes this week."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"I can't. It's like--"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Drake is the meme king."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He's so happy. They make me so happy."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"Drake really gave the universe a gift with that video."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"And you know what?"
01:33:34;01:33:35;"People are being amazing with it too."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"Yeah, people are so creative."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"I hope kids are getting scholarships off of some of it."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"They're going to have the Hotline Bling scholarship."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"Yeah, the Hotline Blingies."
01:33:42;01:33:45;"There should be an award show for the Blingies."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"There has to be a Blingies."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"We have so many good ideas on this episode."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"I know."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"You guys are going to co-host the Blingies."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Yes."
01:33:53;01:33:59;"And we're going to give out scholarships to people who made the best Hotline Bling memes."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Yes."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"I vote the Star Wars one."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I saw it with the lightsaber."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"That's amazing."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Can we find out who made the Star Wars meme?"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"The Star Wars Hotline Bling. Is it a vine?"
01:34:07;01:34:08;"Great question."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"Yeah, I think it is a vine."
01:34:09;01:34:13;"Sometimes it's hard to get to the bottom of who made a meme."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Anyway, Drake, we're sorry you didn't get that number one."
01:34:15;01:34:16;"You deserve it."
01:34:16;01:34:19;"But congratulations on literally everything else."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Two through 100."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Yeah."
01:34:22;01:34:27;"If Drake doesn't have a number one before he retires from music, I'll eat my hat."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Oh, wow."
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Wow."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"You heard it here first, folks."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"Strong words."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"A lot of strong revelations."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"Okay."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Number two on the top five."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"Oh, looks like we got a repeat offender."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Justin Bieber saying sorry."
01:34:41;01:34:51;"Oh, my."
01:34:51;01:34:52;"You gotta go."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"I'm getting angry at all of my honesty."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"You know what?"
01:34:56;01:35:00;"But I don't do too well with apologies."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"I hope I don't run out of time."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"So I'm calling for me."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"Because I just need one more shot."
01:35:07;01:35:11;"I forgiveness."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"I made those mistakes."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Maybe once or twice."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Once or twice."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"I mean, maybe a couple of times."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"So let me or let me redeem."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"I redeem myself tonight."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"I just need one more shot."
01:35:26;01:35:30;"Second chance."
01:35:30;01:35:33;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
01:35:33;01:35:39;"'Cause I'm missing more than just your body."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
01:35:43;01:35:46;"Yeah, I know that I let you down."
01:35:46;01:35:50;"Is it too late to say sorry now?"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"That was Justin Bieber with ""Sorry."""
01:35:52;01:35:54;"Holding it down at number five and number two slots."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"That's his new, new song."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Justin Bieber, ""Sorry."""
01:35:58;01:36:00;"It's got a bit of a Caribbean feel."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"A bit of reggaeton."
01:36:01;01:36:07;"It does."
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Like, so actually, I think the big--"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Everybody talks about Justin Bieber's comeback."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"I think the big secret is that there's kind of a tropical flavor"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"running through all of his singles this summer."
01:36:17;01:36:19;"He did a song with Diplo and Skrillex."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"Obviously, their music--"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"Skrillex coming from dubstep and Diplo doing major lids."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"Their music is very much influenced by the music of Jamaica."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"""What Do You Mean"" had kind of a tropical flavor."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"This has a reggaeton beat, which is also Jamaican."
01:36:31;01:36:34;"So I think the story that we're not hearing enough"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"is that Justin Bieber's the new king of dancehall."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"I think the story that we're going to hear"
01:36:38;01:36:41;"is that Justin Bieber vacations a lot."
01:36:41;01:36:42;"Right."
01:36:42;01:36:45;"You're hearing the influence of vacations."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Right."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"It's like, oh, yeah, because he spends more time"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"on various islands than most people."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"Right."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"You said there's something thematic, though, going on"
01:36:54;01:36:55;"with ""What Do You Mean."""
01:36:55;01:36:57;"What's the first single of the summer?"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"It was ""Where Are You Now?"""
01:36:58;01:36:59;"""Where Are You Now,"" what do you mean?"
01:36:59;01:37:00;"Sorry?"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Like, something-- he's going through some changes."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Well, also remember, he's Canadian."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"So we were talking before, what do you mean is what you say"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"to somebody who's really drunk and you don't understand them."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"And then they say something else unintelligible,"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"and the Canadian person would say, sorry?"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"They say, sorry."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"Sorry."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"So they're actually not pronouncing the song wrong."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"It's actually sorry."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Sorry."
01:37:16;01:37:20;"(SINGING) It's OK to say sorry now."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"Oh, that's how he sings it in Canada."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"I would love it if he sang--"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"I feel like-- and I don't want to disrespect"
01:37:27;01:37:28;"any Canadian people."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"I know that Canada is a big, beautiful country"
01:37:30;01:37:34;"with all sorts of different, exciting accents and dialects."
01:37:34;01:37:37;"But sorry is one of those words-- and I'm sure people"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"think I say sorry in a funny way."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"But sorry is one of those words that when an American person"
01:37:42;01:37:45;"impersonates a Canadian person, they always say, sorry."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Wait, do it."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
01:37:48;01:37:49;"Use it in a sentence."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Sorry, sorry?"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"I'm so sorry."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"Sorry."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"I'm not saying it right, but it's like--"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"Yeah, now--"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Out in a boat."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"They say out in a boat."
01:37:58;01:37:59;"A boat."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Yeah."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"Let's get into the top song, the number one song."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"This is somebody-- an artist we were talking about before."
01:38:04;01:38:09;"She is the ruler of music right now in all senses of the word."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"This is Adele with ""Hello."""
01:38:11;01:38:14;"(SINGING) Hello."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"It's me."
01:38:17;01:38:23;"I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet,"
01:38:23;01:38:28;"to go over everything."
01:38:28;01:38:32;"They say that time's supposed to heal you,"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"but I ain't done much healing."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"Hello."
01:38:38;01:38:41;"Can you hear me?"
01:38:41;01:38:47;"I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when"
01:38:47;01:38:53;"we were younger and free."
01:38:53;01:38:59;"I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet."
01:38:59;01:39:09;"There's such a difference between us and a million miles."
01:39:10;01:39:16;"Hello from the other side."
01:39:16;01:39:25;"I must have called a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"for everything that I've done."
01:39:27;01:39:34;"But when I call, you never seem to be home."
01:39:34;01:39:40;"Hello from the outside."
01:39:40;01:39:49;"At least I can say that I've tried to tell you I'm sorry"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"for breaking your heart."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"But it don't matter."
01:39:53;01:39:59;"It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Adele, ""Hello."""
01:40:00;01:40:01;"What do you guys think?"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"It's fine."
01:40:04;01:40:05;"It's a power ballad."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"It reminds me a little bit of Meatloaf, actually."
01:40:08;01:40:10;"Yeah, it's in that family."
01:40:10;01:40:13;"I would do anything for love."
01:40:13;01:40:16;"If you told me that Diane Warren wrote this song in her shower,"
01:40:16;01:40:17;"I would believe you."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"It's got a little bit of that vibe."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Diane Warren in the shower."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"Do you think about that?"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"I think about where she writes."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"I think she has a dry erase board in the shower."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I think she cries when she writes music."
01:40:28;01:40:30;"That's where she wrote, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."""
01:40:30;01:40:33;"It's still on the board a little bit."
01:40:33;01:40:35;"Adele, ""Hello."""
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Here's my theory about Adele, ""Hello."""
01:40:37;01:40:39;"There's been talk about this song."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Most people are loving it."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"A few people saying, ""Oh, it's a little conservative."""
01:40:43;01:40:48;"I mean, somebody with an amazing voice just singing a deeply moving"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"power ballad."
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Some people think it's conservative."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"But there's something about her comeback in this moment when there's so much"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"competition to see who can be the most next level."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"And then Adele comes back with a beautiful sepia tone, simple video,"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"old school power ballad."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"And she's just kind of like, ""You know what?"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"I'm not playing games."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I'm here to sing."
01:41:06;01:41:08;"I'm here to move you emotionally."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"And I'm not even going to have colors in my video."
01:41:11;01:41:14;"I'm that focused on one thing, making you cry."""
01:41:14;01:41:17;"[laughter]"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"That wasn't even supposed to be a joke, actually."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"That's true."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"It was paced very well."
01:41:21;01:41:22;"Oh, thank you."
01:41:22;01:41:24;"Because she is--I think in her last album,"
01:41:24;01:41:27;"I remember her at an awards show doing ""Someone Like You."""
01:41:27;01:41:28;"It was just a piano."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"And you don't see that that often anymore."
01:41:30;01:41:34;"So, yeah, it is--she is always like a great ode to simplicity."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"Yeah, and that voice is, like, unbeatable."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"And I think she was basically like, ""Oh, really?"
01:41:39;01:41:43;"Everybody and your summer themes and your cute little, like, trendy--"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"check out my voice."""
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Have you cried this season?"
01:41:47;01:41:48;"[laughter]"
01:41:48;01:41:49;"You're listening to..."
01:41:49;01:41:54;"[tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap]"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"[saxophone music]"
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Well, that's a top five."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"That's a pretty good top five."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"It is."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"I think."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"Got some double beeps."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Feels also autumnal."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"It was pretty autumnal."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Like, it feels like things are changing."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"Yeah, because--well, you know what's funny, though, is that I feel like if--"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"because this summer all we did was listen to--"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"okay, ""Cheerleader"" definitely is a summer song."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:15;"But, like, ""The Weekend,"" ""I Can't Feel My Face,"""
01:42:15;01:42:16;"if that dropped right now--"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"It could be a fall song."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"I--yeah."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"I think ""The Hills,"" though, is a summer song."
01:42:22;01:42:23;"Yeah."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"""The Hills"" is more of a summer song."
01:42:24;01:42:25;"Um--"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"So is ""Fetty Wap."""
01:42:26;01:42:29;"I like Vince Giraldi for autumn."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Oh, like the Peanuts?"
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Yeah, yeah, like the Peanuts."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"That's what I think autumn--"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"I just think Vince Giraldi first."
01:42:34;01:42:35;"Do you--wait."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"Oh, that's good."
01:42:36;01:42:37;"But not--not--and then--"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"not ""Christmas Time."""
01:42:38;01:42:39;"Charlie Brown, ""Christmas."""
01:42:39;01:42:41;"I think--I think--"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"[singing]"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"It's--he's more of--"
01:42:43;01:42:45;"when I think Charlie Brown, I think more Thanksgiving,"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"more autumn, more, like--"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"That's a really good--"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"That's actually a perfect autumn note."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"Wait, like what?"
01:42:49;01:42:50;"Like the Grape Pumpkin Waltz?"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Or Thanksgiving theme."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Is this what you're talking about?"
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Or the Thanksgiving theme."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"[piano music]"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"Sounds like leaves falling."
01:42:56;01:42:57;"So good."
01:42:57;01:42:58;"Well, I like this."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Let's listen to this."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"Here's Gerard's pick."
01:43:01;01:43:04;"After all that pop music,"
01:43:04;01:43:07;"here's some nice Italian-American jazz."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"Italian-American jazz?"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"[laughter]"
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Not a genre."

01:50:38;01:50:40;"That was Lana Del Rey with Video Games."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"Another beautiful song I associate with autumn."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"That's one of my favorite songs of all time."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"Um, you know what guys?"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"I just got hit up by one of my best Twitter friends."
01:50:49;01:50:53;"I've never met him in person, but he runs a great Twitter account called Seinfeld2000."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Have you heard of it?"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Yes, I have."
01:50:56;01:50:59;"He imagined, he, all sorts of funny jokes about Seinfeld and"
01:50:59;01:51:02;"especially talks about what if Seinfeld was still on TV today."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"And um, I said, ""Hey man, why don't you call him to the show?"""
01:51:05;01:51:07;"He seemed really excited, like he wanted to call him to the show."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"And we've never really had a guest via the phone, so"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"we're gonna try this."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"So, um, so, Jerry, are you there?"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"Uncle Leo!"
01:51:15;01:51:19;"It's a reference to Seinfeld."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"Oh right, Uncle Leo was a character on Seinfeld."
01:51:21;01:51:23;"Right, right, that's a Seinfeld."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"Darn off with the bang!"
01:51:25;01:51:30;"Sometimes George would call and he was in a crisis type of situation"
01:51:30;01:51:35;"and then Jerry is like sarcastically pretending that it's Uncle Leo."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"But he knows who it is."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Right, he knows it's George."
01:51:38;01:51:40;"Yeah, it was a very funny show."
01:51:40;01:51:43;"So Jerry, we all know who you are, but I want to explain to my guests"
01:51:43;01:51:46;"who might not be familiar with you or the Seinfeld 2000 account."
01:51:46;01:51:50;"Your account started just because you're a big Seinfeld fan and you"
01:51:50;01:51:53;"like to imagine what would the show be like if it was still on air."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"Is that correct?"
01:51:54;01:51:56;"Yeah, for sure."
01:51:56;01:52:00;"We all know that Seinfeld was cancelled in 1998 just because the ratings"
01:52:00;01:52:03;"by the end were just like abysmal."
01:52:03;01:52:07;"But we've had a lot of changes societally."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"There have been a lot of advancements."
01:52:09;01:52:12;"There have been a lot of technological devices and things that have come"
01:52:12;01:52:17;"along that have changed how we operate in many different ways."
01:52:17;01:52:22;"And I just think it would be hilarious if you apply that to Seinfeld"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"with the characters that are so familiar."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"Does that make sense?"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"What's an example for people at home who don't know the concept?"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"What do you mean?"
01:52:30;01:52:32;"The characters but with modern advancement."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"What's an example?"
01:52:33;01:52:39;"For example, just off the top of my head, what if George gets really upset"
01:52:39;01:52:44;"because Jerry doesn't favorite the Hotline Bling meme that he spent"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"all night making?"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"Okay, right."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"You can see where I'm going with this, right?"
01:52:50;01:52:54;"Right, like they'd probably use more internet stuff, right?"
01:52:54;01:52:57;"Yeah, I mean I think you're simplifying it a little bit."
01:52:57;01:52:58;"Yeah."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Okay, sorry, I don't mean to oversimplify it."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"I love the account."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"It's very funny."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Hey, check this one out."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"Yeah, okay, let's hear it."
01:53:04;01:53:05;"Check this one out."
01:53:05;01:53:09;"Elaine starts a mobile dating app like Tinder, but it's called Spongeworthy."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"It's like spelled like there are no vowels."
01:53:11;01:53:13;"It looks like a series of consonants."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Okay, that's funny."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"Yeah, I like that because Spongeworthy was on the original series"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"and this is if you updated it."
01:53:19;01:53:21;"Well, that's pretty cool, man."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"Yeah, I mean you don't need to patronize me."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"No, I'm sorry."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"I don't mean to patronize you at all."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"It's a very funny account."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"It's a lot of fun."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"How was your Halloween, man?"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Yeah, Halloween was cool."
01:53:33;01:53:35;"Halloween was cool, you know."
01:53:35;01:53:40;"I guess you could say the whole neighborhood was buzzing over my costume"
01:53:40;01:53:48;"because I dressed up as Barry B. Benson from Jerry Seinfeld's 2007 animated classic B-movie."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"Oh."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"You get it."
01:53:50;01:53:54;"So when I say buzzing, it's like a reference to--it's like a B-joke."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Oh, right, right."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"I've never seen B-movie myself."
01:53:57;01:53:58;"What?"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"I've never seen B-movie."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Why not?"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"I mean I like Seinfeld the series."
01:54:04;01:54:07;"I guess I wasn't that interested in seeing--because it's for kids, right?"
01:54:07;01:54:12;"So as far as I'm concerned, B-movie is like kind of like the real finale of Seinfeld."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"It's like an additional bonus episode."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Rashida, have you seen the B-movie?"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"I haven't."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"I'm sad to say."
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Aren't you writing a Toy Story?"
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Yeah."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Okay."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"I don't know."
01:54:24;01:54:27;"It's important to do research I guess on animated films."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"Or not."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Just my opinion."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Or not."
01:54:31;01:54:35;"Okay, Jerry, things are getting--we want to talk about Seinfeld first and foremost."
01:54:35;01:54:38;"I really appreciated that you wanted to call into the show."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"You said you had some kind of announcement earlier."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"What's that all about?"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Yeah."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Are you guys sitting down?"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Yeah, we're all sitting down."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Excellent."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"All right."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"This is too exciting."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"Okay."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"Seinfeld--"
01:54:49;01:54:50;"Yeah."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"--is coming back to TV."
01:54:51;01:54:55;"Oh, do you mean they just did some big deal for the reruns?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"No, you don't understand."
01:54:57;01:55:04;"Jerry, Larry David, JLD, Jason Alexander, even Michael Richards have all signed on to"
01:55:04;01:55:07;"do all new webisodes of Seinfeld coming back to TV."
01:55:07;01:55:08;"Boom."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"It's a Time Crisis exclusive."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"You heard it here first only on Beats 1 from Apple Music."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"Okay."
01:55:14;01:55:19;"This is obviously--you're doing a bit now because obviously Seinfeld's not coming back."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"This is a joke."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"Okay."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"Do you think I would mess with you like this?"
01:55:22;01:55:27;"Do you think I would just come on your show and break the huge news if it wasn't true?"
01:55:27;01:55:32;"Dude, the details are scant, but I have it on pretty good authority that it will be coming"
01:55:32;01:55:33;"back."
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Well, Jerry--"
01:55:34;01:55:35;"And it's going to be set in 2016."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Okay, Jerry, hold on a second."
01:55:36;01:55:41;"What I love about Seinfeld 2000 is that we kind of understand the readers and you, we"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"understand that Seinfeld's not coming back."
01:55:43;01:55:44;"That's what makes it funny."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Yeah, I know."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"And that was the past."
01:55:46;01:55:51;"But, you know, I'm as blown away by it as you are, and I can understand your skepticism."
01:55:51;01:55:54;"Okay, no, no, I gotta say you're making me a little bit uncomfortable."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"Well, hold on, hold on."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"This is my show."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Don't talk over me."
01:55:57;01:56:01;"I'm sorry, my friend, but you don't have any real information that Seinfeld's coming back"
01:56:01;01:56:02;"on TV."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"I do, yeah."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Yeah, I do, for sure."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"I have it on good authority."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"From who?"
01:56:07;01:56:10;"You're really putting me on the spot here?"
01:56:10;01:56:13;"I was like, I kind of promised I wouldn't really reveal my sources."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"You don't have it on good authority."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"I do, like, my sources, like this is supposed to be like a..."
01:56:16;01:56:19;"No, Seinfeld ended a long time ago and it's not coming back."
01:56:19;01:56:20;"Jerry told me."
01:56:20;01:56:21;"Jerry did not tell..."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"You don't know Jerry Seinfeld."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"Jerry?"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"No, but through Twitter I'm friends with Jerry."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"Okay, hold on."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"What you have is an obsession with Jerry Seinfeld, and it's sick and it's deranged."
01:56:30;01:56:35;"Listen, I have nothing but the utmost respect for you, Ezra, but when I tell you Seinfeld"
01:56:35;01:56:38;"is coming back, it is coming back, okay?"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"Please cut him."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"I'm going to abuse your trust."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"To everybody who is listening at home, I'm sorry."
01:56:42;01:56:48;"He truly has a disgusting obsession with Seinfeld, and I want to apologize to everybody who is"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"listening at home."
01:56:49;01:56:50;"That was a little weird."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"That was crazy."
01:56:51;01:56:54;"I'm sorry, guys, because I know I vouch for this guy."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"I have you on the show."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"Jarod, Rashid, I'm very sorry."
01:56:57;01:57:02;"Yeah, I will put Seinfeld coming back in that things I would hear about category, right?"
