00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, episode 51. Jake returns from Vermont. We'll talk about that, plus"
00:08;00:15;"weather. Cold, cold East Coast weather. All this, plus Zack Fox, the artist"
00:15;00:20;"formerly known as Booty Math. We'll also count down the top five hits of today"
00:20;00:24;"and 1980. This is a very special..."
00:24;00:32;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:38;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:38;00:45;"You were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances."
00:45;00:52;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:52;00:59;"And so I dealt you the blow, when the bus had to go."
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:04;01:10;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:10;01:13;"Leave it on me babe."
01:13;01:18;"Time Crisis, West Coast edition restored. Jake, welcome back."
01:18;01:19;"Thank you."
01:19;01:23;"On the last episode, you were up in the wilderness in Vermont."
01:23;01:24;"Yeah."
01:24;01:28;"I was holding it down here with Deathspot and Cousin Asher. Shout out to those guys."
01:28;01:30;"Great episode."
01:30;01:32;"Thanks for calling in, thanks for listening."
01:32;01:33;"Yeah."
01:33;01:34;"Jake."
01:34;01:35;"Absolutely."
01:35;01:39;"So when you were up in Vermont, you were staying at a kind of hotel type place where you had no service."
01:39;01:40;"Yep."
01:40;01:41;"And no Wi-Fi."
01:41;01:42;"Correct."
01:42;01:46;"Sun up to sun down. You're not checking emails, you're not checking Instagram?"
01:46;01:47;"Off the grid."
01:47;01:48;"Fully?"
01:48;01:50;"Fully. Felt great."
01:50;01:52;"So you straight up didn't check your email for a week?"
01:52;01:57;"I would say every other day we would drive into town, which was like a 15 minute drive."
01:57;01:59;"And go to a cyber cafe?"
01:59;02:03;"No, we would just like park on the street in Stowe, Vermont and um..."
02:03;02:04;"Oh, and then you'd have service."
02:04;02:05;"Fire up your phone."
02:05;02:06;"Right."
02:06;02:09;"So how did it feel to be off the grid?"
02:09;02:10;"It was amazing."
02:10;02:15;"How did you feel different? You feel like more relaxed? Did you have more mental acuity?"
02:15;02:18;"I don't know about that. I could see that happening. If like I had..."
02:18;02:20;"Did you have more peace of mind?"
02:20;02:27;"I found that like checking Twitter and Instagram, it's confirmed, is a huge waste of time."
02:27;02:30;"Oh, because I didn't miss it at all."
02:30;02:31;"Okay, maybe for you."
02:31;02:37;"I didn't need to know every four hours what the new Trump news was."
02:37;02:39;"That doesn't improve your life at all."
02:39;02:40;"Right."
02:40;02:43;"Because generally if I check in, like Instagram is pretty like..."
02:43;02:45;"That can be pretty low-key and innocuous."
02:45;02:46;"Yeah."
02:46;02:48;"And it's like people's kids or like your friends or whatever."
02:48;02:52;"Like if you check the internet beyond Instagram, it's just all Trump."
02:52;02:53;"Right."
02:53;02:58;"And I don't need that all the time, especially if I'm just kicking it by a lake in Vermont,"
02:58;03:03;"doing some fishing, doing some swimming, sitting on the porch reading a novel."
03:03;03:05;"How about that? Sitting on a porch..."
03:05;03:07;"You sat on the porch and read a novel?"
03:07;03:14;"In a rocking chair and read the new Tom Perotta novel, Mrs. Fletcher, in about a day and a half."
03:14;03:16;"Was it like big text?"
03:16;03:18;"Normal text."
03:18;03:19;"Normal text."
03:19;03:23;"So you took down a novel. What do you call it? Current fiction?"
03:23;03:24;"Contemporary fiction."
03:24;03:27;"A contemporary fiction novel in a day and a half."
03:27;03:28;"Yep."
03:28;03:33;"Because if I read normally, like if I get into bed at my house in LA and I read,"
03:33;03:39;"I get into bed, I look at my phone and then I get sucked into like BS on Twitter for 12 minutes."
03:39;03:40;"Well, that's a classic thing."
03:40;03:42;"And then I read for five minutes and then I'm asleep."
03:42;03:49;"I sometimes make the excuse for myself almost like it's because I'm just such a curious person,"
03:49;03:53;"but it's also just because like, you know, I'm just a scumbag like everybody with no self-control."
03:53;03:55;"You flatter yourself. I'm curious."
03:55;03:58;"I flatter myself that I'm curious because this does happen a lot."
03:58;04:03;"I'll be reading a book, like, you know, a real paper book."
04:03;04:04;"Yeah."
04:04;04:07;"And I'll come across a word I don't know, a reference to something."
04:07;04:12;"And I want to, you know, like Wikipedia generation, I want to check what that is."
04:12;04:15;"So then next thing you know, I'm on Wikipedia."
04:15;04:20;"Hours go by. Somehow I end up back on Instagram."
04:20;04:23;"You end up reading about like the formation of Chuck E. Cheese."
04:23;04:27;"Right. So you read a whole novel in a rocking chair."
04:27;04:28;"Yeah."
04:28;04:33;"That's what the world has come to is that you got to fly across the country."
04:33;04:36;"Surely you have novels in rocking chairs at home in LA."
04:36;04:39;"No rocking chair, but yeah."
04:39;04:41;"I try more and more to log off."
04:41;04:44;"And this place where we were staying, the Lake Mansfield Trout Club,"
04:44;04:51;"they've made the very conscious and deliberate effort to keep the Internet out of that place."
04:51;04:54;"I mean, they could easily wire the place."
04:54;04:55;"Right."
04:55;04:59;"I don't know, like I guess the management and their members there have decided to like, you know."
04:59;05:00;"Right. We don't want any Internet."
05:00;05:01;"Right."
05:01;05:08;"I like the vibe sometimes when you're out somewhere staying in a house or staying in a hotel or something."
05:08;05:15;"And it's not that you like are fully logged off, but you're in that kind of vibe where you're like, I'll leave my phone in my room."
05:15;05:16;"Yeah."
05:16;05:27;"Because most of the time when I'm in LA or New York or something, I'm staying in a residence that's too small for me to ever be more than, say, 15 feet away from my phone."
05:27;05:28;"Right."
05:28;05:29;"So you're at like a big house."
05:29;05:30;"A big sprawling house."
05:30;05:33;"Or you're out in the country or something and you walk down to the pool."
05:33;05:45;"I love that vibe where it's like your phone is functioning, but you just have that peace of mind where you can like be, you know, you're in your bedroom, you look at your phone, put it down, walk down to the creek, go hang out."
05:45;05:50;"And then, you know, next thing you know, you've been fishing with your buddies, cracking a few cold ones."
05:50;05:51;"And then you come back to the house."
05:51;05:52;"Two hours have passed."
05:52;05:55;"You didn't have your phone on you and you're not freaking out because you're in the country."
05:55;05:57;"And no one's texted or called."
05:57;05:58;"No, then you pick up the phone."
05:58;05:59;"And there's no emails."
05:59;06:00;"And that's great."
06:00;06:04;"Then you pick up the phone, you have a healthy haul of four to five texts and/or missed calls."
06:04;06:10;"Not too many to overwhelm you, make you think that somebody died, and not too few to make you feel like a loser."
06:10;06:12;"Sometimes I'm relieved when I have nothing."
06:12;06:13;"Nothing?"
06:13;06:15;"Sometimes that just gives me a huge sigh of relief."
06:15;06:17;"Really? You don't want to, you don't like a healthy haul?"
06:17;06:18;"Sometimes I do."
06:18;06:19;"A healthy haul of four to five?"
06:19;06:21;"A healthy haul of four to five."
06:21;06:25;"You came from out of nowhere."
06:25;06:29;"You came in an if-good time."
06:29;06:33;"I can't believe my luck now."
06:33;06:35;"Came to my rescue."
06:35;06:37;"I'm heaven-bound."
06:37;06:41;"Whoever thought I'd meet a winner."
06:41;06:46;"You were an angel in disguise."
06:46;06:54;"Best things come unexpected, out of nowhere, what a surprise."
06:54;06:58;"This time I hit the jackpot."
06:58;07:02;"How lucky can a guy be?"
07:02;07:06;"This time I hit the jackpot."
07:06;07:10;"Lady luck smiling on me."
07:10;07:12;"Okay."
07:12;07:18;"You saved my life now, and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart."
07:18;07:24;"And this time I hit the jackpot."
07:24;07:26;"Now you're gonna stay mine."
07:26;07:28;"How many texts are you getting a day, you think?"
07:28;07:33;"Unsolicited communication from people in your contacts hitting you up."
07:33;07:40;"Are we discounting like girlfriend, mom, dad, sibling, like inner circle?"
07:40;07:41;"Sure."
07:41;07:50;"I don't know, like, well, see, that's the thing, is like, I'm rarely away from my phone long enough to do that healthy haul."
07:50;07:54;"Because sometimes, you know, you sit on your phone and it's like next to you for an hour."
07:54;07:55;"And then it's like just going."
07:55;07:57;"So you just get every text that comes in in real time."
07:57;08:01;"And then sometimes I love these moments when I truly put it down, walk away."
08:01;08:02;"I'm just saying it's harder to do."
08:02;08:08;"I walk away and then over an hour or two, the texts accrue and then I come back to the healthy haul."
08:08;08:19;"I don't know, in a day, like if I just put my phone down on a normal weekday, I woke up at 8 a.m., flip my phone over, walk down to the creek."
08:19;08:21;"Come back at 8 p.m."
08:21;08:22;"Come back at 8 p.m."
08:22;08:23;"12 hours."
08:23;08:24;"On a normal weekday."
08:24;08:25;"Let's test this."
08:25;08:27;"I don't know if I can."
08:27;08:31;"I would think I'd probably have like 10 to 15."
08:31;08:32;"Discreet messages."
08:32;08:35;"Discreet texts/missed calls."
08:35;08:40;"But you know what else? I'm also like counting like people I work with, like my management."
08:40;08:48;"You know what? Yeah, once you strip away people I work with, inner circle friends, romantic partners and nuclear family."
08:48;08:50;"Time crisis family as well."
08:50;08:54;"And time crisis family, then it's going to be the random one or two a day."
08:54;08:56;"I mean, what about you?"
08:56;09:01;"When you're in your studio painting, do you go an hour without looking at your phone?"
09:01;09:02;"Yeah."
09:02;09:03;"Two hours?"
09:03;09:05;"Yeah, sometimes."
09:05;09:11;"I mean, what happens is I'll be listening to music or like a podcast on my phone."
09:11;09:13;"But I'll have the phone on silent."
09:13;09:15;"So I won't even know if I'm getting things."
09:15;09:18;"So you're just plastered in Europe 72."
09:18;09:19;"Yeah."
09:19;09:21;"And when you get the text, you don't get that little ""bing""?"
09:21;09:22;"No."
09:22;09:23;"And the music goes down. No, so you don't even know."
09:23;09:24;"No."
09:24;09:25;"Alright."
09:25;09:33;"I'm on the party line, wondering all the time, who's on the other end?"
09:33;09:38;"Is she big, is she small, is she a she at all?"
09:38;09:42;"Who's on my party line?"
09:42;09:46;"Wish I had a more direct connection."
09:46;09:51;"This party line was here when I arrived."
09:51;09:56;"And I am not voting in the next election."
09:56;10:06;"If they don't do something about filing out the person who is on my party line."
10:06;10:15;"I'm on the party line."
10:15;10:19;"I'm on the party line."
10:19;10:24;"I can't speak without an interception."
10:24;10:28;"This is private, please get off my line."
10:28;10:33;"Please tell me when I can have my privacy."
10:33;10:40;"I'd like to meet the girl who's always talking when I'm speaking on my party line."
10:40;11:00;"Wish I had a more direct connection."
11:00;11:05;"This party line was here when I arrived."
11:05;11:10;"And I am not voting in the next election."
11:10;11:16;"If they don't do something about filing out the person who is on my party line."
11:16;11:25;"I'm on the party line, wondering all the time, who's on the other end?"
11:25;11:29;"Is she big, is she small, is she a she at all?"
11:29;11:34;"Who's on my party line?"
11:34;11:38;"Who's on my party line?"
11:42;11:46;"Another thing I wanted to talk about that we were talking about last weekend."
11:46;11:50;"You know, we're pretty harsh on Wendy's on the program."
11:50;11:54;"We really lay into all Wendy's because we don't believe a lot of what they say in their advertising."
11:54;12:00;"But you had a kind of memory pop up that we never really talked about on this show."
12:00;12:03;"And I think the older listeners will definitely appreciate it."
12:03;12:08;"And maybe it will inspire them to hear about a time gone by."
12:08;12:14;"And the thing that you brought up was that Wendy's used to have salad bars."
12:14;12:16;"Yeah, they used to have a salad bar."
12:16;12:18;"I totally forgot that."
12:18;12:19;"What's up with that?"
12:19;12:20;"All Wendy's?"
12:20;12:23;"Well, I'm not going to go to bat for that."
12:23;12:29;"But yes, I remember going to Wendy's and even as a kid just being like, whoa."
12:29;12:34;"Just like the thing of like ranch sitting at like room temperature and like the plastic bin."
12:34;12:37;"This is a Wendy's super bar commercial."
12:37;12:42;"Piano bars, handlebars, even Zanzibars."
12:42;12:44;"You've got a year on this?"
12:44;12:47;"88. Wait, so you hear that?"
12:47;12:49;"Almost Frazier-esque."
12:49;12:52;"Oh yeah, this is just like the Frazier theme song actually."
12:52;12:55;"This guy's saying you've seen handlebars, you've seen Zanzibar."
12:55;12:58;"But you've never seen anything like the Wendy's super bar."
12:58;13:04;"Even Zanzibars, but you've never seen nothing like Wendy's super bar."
13:04;13:07;"Where you get all you can eat for one low price."
13:07;13:08;"Only at Wendy's."
13:08;13:11;"The best burgers in the business and a whole lot more."
13:11;13:15;"I wonder how much the all you can eat salad bar in 88 was at Wendy's."
13:15;13:16;"That's a great question."
13:16;13:18;"$1.99? $2.99?"
13:18;13:22;"The salad bar, like maybe it started as a salad bar, then they made the super bar."
13:22;13:27;"The super bar also seems to have spaghetti with tomato sauce."
13:27;13:28;"Okay, really?"
13:28;13:30;"And tacos, yeah."
13:30;13:32;"1988, they're showing tacos in the commercial."
13:32;13:33;"Tacos I can see."
13:33;13:36;"Where you get all you can eat for one low price."
13:36;13:37;"Only at Wendy's."
13:37;13:40;"The best burgers in the business and a whole lot more."
13:40;13:42;"Wendy's used to have salad bars."
13:42;13:46;"And you made also a good point, is that there used to be salad bars everywhere."
13:46;13:50;"I guess now all these places have salad, but they're like pre-made?"
13:50;13:52;"Or you just order the salad, they hand it to you?"
13:52;13:55;"Yeah, it's in like a pre, you know, it's like in like the individual package."
13:55;13:57;"Like clear plastic."
13:57;13:59;"People used to really be into salad bars."
13:59;14:02;"They really, there are far fewer of them now."
14:02;14:06;"And one thing that you pointed out is there were so many salad bars in the 80s and 90s"
14:06;14:12;"that there was a salad bar thing that became part of the lexicon"
14:12;14:15;"that I wonder if the young people today have even heard about."
14:15;14:16;"Sneeze guard?"
14:16;14:18;"Yeah, sneeze guard."
14:18;14:19;"Yeah, sneeze guard."
14:19;14:20;"How old are you again?"
14:20;14:23;"I'm 34, 35 actually."
14:23;14:25;"I don't know why I lied. I'm 35."
14:25;14:27;"Do you remember sneeze guards?"
14:27;14:28;"Yeah, I remember."
14:28;14:29;"Did they have those up in Canada?"
14:29;14:32;"Bigly, yeah, they had the sneeze guards in Canada."
14:32;14:35;"I was just thinking about how Wendy's used to have a smoking section."
14:35;14:36;"Do you remember that?"
14:36;14:39;"But it would like, there was no division, so the smoke would just be wafting around the Wendy's."
14:39;14:40;"I don't remember that."
14:40;14:42;"Did you have that in the USA?"
14:42;14:43;"No."
14:43;14:44;"It's the USA."
14:44;14:45;"Well."
14:45;14:46;"Wait, wait, hold on."
14:46;14:47;"I don't think--"
14:47;14:49;"Is that a real Canadian thing that you just say in USA?"
14:49;14:52;"That sounds more like a Borat thing."
14:52;14:55;"Did you have that in the United States?"
14:55;14:56;"No."
14:56;15:00;"If you went into a Wendy's in like 1985, I don't think you could smoke in there."
15:00;15:01;"Oh, we had that."
15:01;15:02;"We had that."
15:02;15:05;"I wonder if Canada was more liberal with their smoking."
15:05;15:08;"And by liberal, I mean more lenient with smokers."
15:08;15:10;"So when you were like a kid--"
15:10;15:15;"I remember my mom would say, you know, let's go to Wendy's, let's get a Dave's Big Double or whatever."
15:15;15:16;"And I loved Wendy's."
15:16;15:18;"I'll smoke a cig."
15:18;15:20;"She wasn't smoking."
15:20;15:23;"I'll smoke a Du Maurier."
15:23;15:27;"Yeah, because I'm fiending for a Du Maurier."
15:27;15:28;"What's that, a Canadian cigarette?"
15:28;15:30;"That's a Canadian cigarette with the red package."
15:30;15:32;"That was like our Marlboro."
15:32;15:33;"Du Maurier?"
15:33;15:34;"Du Maurier."
15:34;15:36;"You sitting in the smoking section with your mom?"
15:36;15:37;"I'm endlessly--"
15:37;15:38;"Just blowing smoke clouds."
15:38;15:39;"I really love Canada."
15:39;15:43;"I'm endlessly amazed how like different--"
15:43;15:45;"There's just so many little details, you know, for places."
15:45;15:47;"Two places so similar and so close."
15:47;15:49;"Did they have Loonies back then?"
15:49;15:51;"Loonies, yeah."
15:51;15:56;"I think I was like 10 when the Loonies came in and then maybe like 14 when the Toonies came in."
15:56;16:02;"Okay, so Loonies and Toonies, for people who don't know, is the Canadian dollar and $2 coins."
16:02;16:03;"Oh, wow."
16:03;16:05;"And it's a gold coin, right?"
16:05;16:08;"Yeah, I mean it's gold colored."
16:08;16:09;"Right."
16:09;16:16;"Okay, so she might have said, ""Seinfeld, get in the car, grab a handful of Loonies, a pack of Du Mauriers."
16:16;16:21;"We're going to Wendy's to hit the super bar and smoke ourselves silly."""
16:21;16:23;"I'll get you a Frosty."
16:23;16:25;"I found six Loonies in the couch cushions."
16:25;16:29;"Let's head over to Wendy's because I'm itching for smoke."
16:29;16:33;"I have a big plate of Wendy's linguine with clam sauce."
16:33;16:37;"So there probably was somebody back in the day in Canada who would have said,"
16:37;16:42;"""Hey, Frank, you got a Toonie? I'm going down to Tim Horton's to buy a pack of Du Mauriers."""
16:42;16:43;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
16:43;16:45;"No, that sounds very Canadian, what you just said."
16:45;16:47;"That sounds very passable."
17:07;17:15;"Viceroy, early in the morning"
17:15;17:20;"Just trying to let the sun in"
17:20;17:27;"And open up my eyes"
17:27;17:36;"Viceroy, as it's getting later"
17:36;17:41;"I'm heading for the corner"
17:41;17:48;"Already running dry"
17:48;17:58;"And oh, don't let me see you cry"
17:58;18:13;"'Cause, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying"
18:13;18:22;"Viceroy, don't take me for a fool now"
18:22;18:27;"I'm only trying to calm down"
18:27;18:34;"Just trying to keep it cool"
18:34;18:42;"Viceroy, as it's getting later"
18:42;18:47;"I'm heading for the corner"
18:47;18:54;"I'm leaving it to you"
18:54;19:04;"And oh, don't let me see you cry"
19:04;19:09;"'Cause, honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying"
19:42;19:43;"Beats one."
19:43;19:47;"Ezra Koenig's Time Crisis."
19:47;19:50;"I imagine Canada has lower rates of depression than..."
19:50;19:51;"Or is it?"
19:51;19:52;"I always wonder about this."
19:52;19:53;"Jeez. Climate, though, dude."
19:53;19:55;"You know what? Maybe it's because I, like, I've been, we were talking about it."
19:55;19:56;"I've just been in LA too long."
19:56;19:59;"I'm just, like, I miss the East Coast so badly."
19:59;20:01;"I miss the weather. I miss the light."
20:01;20:04;"I just haven't, like, woken up on a cold morning,"
20:04;20:06;"had a hot cup of coffee,"
20:06;20:08;"went outside, had to wrap a scarf around my face."
20:08;20:11;"These are all things that I know intellectually get old"
20:11;20:13;"after a while when you're in a really cold place."
20:13;20:14;"Like, day two."
20:14;20:17;"Maybe, like, day 30."
20:17;20:19;"But I'm picturing Canada,"
20:19;20:21;"and I'm just picturing, like, young Seinfeld"
20:21;20:23;"just walking out in the freezing Montreal,"
20:23;20:25;"beautiful sunlight,"
20:25;20:27;"old Montreal,"
20:27;20:30;"stole a Des Mauriers from mom,"
20:30;20:32;"got a couple of Toonies in his pocket."
20:32;20:34;"It's just so appealing to me."
20:34;20:36;"And then I picture being here in LA,"
20:36;20:37;"and I just picture, like, baking in the sun."
20:37;20:39;"It was like, you know, a week ago,"
20:39;20:41;"it was getting over 100 degrees,"
20:41;20:44;"that harsh white LA summer light."
20:44;20:46;"Yeah, but, dude, January here is amazing."
20:46;20:48;"Is it? I don't even remember anymore."
20:48;20:49;"Yeah."
20:49;20:50;"You're not with me at all, Jake."
20:50;20:51;"You grew up in Connecticut."
20:51;20:54;"You know that East Coast, fall, winter."
20:54;20:55;"Early spring."
20:55;20:58;"There's nothing appealing to you at all about..."
20:58;20:59;"Yeah, I mean, for a day or two,"
20:59;21:02;"I'm not nostalgic for it."
21:02;21:04;"I mean, I love an East Coast summer."
21:04;21:05;"If there's one season that I miss,"
21:05;21:07;"it's the East Coast summer."
21:07;21:09;"I was just back in Vermont, you know, in August."
21:09;21:10;"Right."
21:10;21:11;"That was great."
21:11;21:13;"I don't miss the winter at all."
21:13;21:15;"But what about the coziness?"
21:15;21:18;"You can get cozy at home."
21:18;21:19;"I mean, you know, LA,"
21:19;21:21;"it'll drop down into the 40s at night,"
21:21;21:23;"maybe the high 30s."
21:23;21:26;"On a winter night, you know,"
21:26;21:29;"you're outside for 10 minutes."
21:29;21:30;"Ooh, that's, you know,"
21:30;21:32;"it sends a chill through your bones."
21:32;21:34;"Get inside, make some tea."
21:34;21:35;"Okay."
21:35;21:37;"Cozy up, throw in Narco season three."
21:37;21:39;"That sounds pretty tight."
21:39;21:41;"Ezra, it sounds like you're just really hankering"
21:41;21:42;"for East Coast time."
21:42;21:43;"Yeah."
21:43;21:44;"I know I am."
21:44;21:47;"I spent one day on the East Coast this entire summer."
21:47;21:48;"Really? That's it?"
21:48;21:49;"Literally one day."
21:49;21:51;"It's funny, too, because I think of you as an East Coast guy."
21:51;21:52;"I'm an East Coast guy."
21:52;21:53;"I know you are,"
21:53;21:55;"and you've been living out here for a few years."
21:55;21:56;"Been living in exile, basically."
21:56;21:57;"We've been doing the show out here."
21:57;21:58;"It's been great."
21:58;22:01;"This is like one week in LA turned into two years, basically."
22:01;22:03;"So you got a taste of that crisp, cool weather."
22:03;22:04;"I know."
22:04;22:06;"I've never gone this long without some crisp, cool weather."
22:06;22:09;"Well, go back this fall, man."
22:09;22:10;"I'll try."
22:10;22:12;"I mean, yeah, it's just I got too much going on here."
22:12;22:14;"Oh, good job."
22:14;22:15;"What's going on with you?"
22:15;22:16;"You have a show coming out?"
22:16;22:18;"Oh, yeah, we got the cartoon coming out."
22:18;22:20;"That just got announced last week."
22:20;22:21;"We got to get Jaden on."
22:21;22:22;"Congrats."
22:22;22:23;"Thank you."
22:23;22:25;"We got to get Jaden on Time Crisis."
22:25;22:27;"People might not know what I'm talking about."
22:27;22:30;"Jaden Smith, actor, musician, entrepreneur."
22:30;22:33;"We made a cartoon."
22:33;22:34;"I'm not calling it an anime,"
22:34;22:39;"even though we teamed up with these kind of well-known Japanese anime studios,"
22:39;22:44;"and we worked very closely with Japanese storyboard artists and character designers,"
22:44;22:47;"and it's in arguably the style of anime."
22:47;22:48;"I don't want to get into this whole thing."
22:48;22:49;"I'm not going to call it an anime."
22:49;22:50;"I just call it a cartoon because--"
22:50;22:51;"Sure."
22:51;22:52;"--we're American."
22:52;22:56;"It's a cross-cultural collaboration between us and the Japanese team, the Korean team."
22:56;22:58;"Most of it was animated in Korea."
22:58;22:59;"Gotcha."
22:59;23:00;"So, anyway, Jaden's the star of that."
23:00;23:03;"It's called Neo Yokio, and the trailer's up now."
23:03;23:06;"It's going to come out very soon on Netflix."
23:06;23:09;"But, anyway, I want to have Jaden on the show."
23:09;23:12;"I once was on his show because he used to have a Beats 1 radio show."
23:12;23:13;"Oh, really?"
23:13;23:14;"Yeah."
23:14;23:16;"You know, I was thinking we should start a new segment on this show."
23:16;23:18;"We've kind of danced around this."
23:18;23:22;"I think you and I are both very interested in the daily grind."
23:22;23:24;"Like people's routines?"
23:24;23:26;"In so many words, yes."
23:26;23:27;"[laughs]"
23:27;23:28;"The routine."
23:28;23:32;"So, I was thinking we should do a segment, and I know Jaden would definitely have an interesting one,"
23:32;23:37;"where it's just like, ""Walk us through your typical day."""
23:37;23:39;"Yeah, the alarm goes off at what time."
23:39;23:40;"Yeah."
23:40;23:41;"And you're going to bed at what time."
23:41;23:43;"What should we call the segment?"
23:43;23:44;"What's Your Day-to-Day Like?"
23:44;23:45;"Oh, What's Your Day-to-Day Like?"
23:45;23:46;"That's what it's called."
23:46;23:47;"[laughs]"
23:47;23:48;"That's the title."
23:48;23:50;"It's like an NPR segment."
23:50;23:52;"Today we have actor Russell Crowe on."
23:52;23:53;"[laughs]"
23:53;23:56;"Tell me, Russell, what's your day-to-day like?"
23:56;24:02;"Reporting from Los Angeles, California, our correspondent, Joe Perry,"
24:02;24:07;"is sitting down with actor Russell Crowe for a segment called What's Your Day-to-Day Like?"
24:07;24:08;"Walk me through."
24:08;24:10;"Well, anyway, we actually do have a guest today."
24:10;24:13;"We got Zach Fox, formerly known as Booty Math."
24:13;24:14;"Okay."
24:14;24:15;"[laughs]"
24:15;24:16;"That's a cool name."
24:16;24:20;"He used to be @bootymath on Twitter."
24:20;24:22;"Now he just goes by his name @ZachFox."
24:22;24:28;"He's an author, actor, radio host, art director of awful records, all-around talented dude."
24:28;24:30;"I wonder why he bailed on Booty Math."
24:30;24:31;"We got to find out."
24:31;24:32;"Let's get Zach Fox in here."
24:32;24:37;"And I'm going to start--I think I want to kick off this What's Your Day-to-Day segment with Zach,"
24:37;24:39;"and then we're going to follow up with Jaden on a future episode."
24:39;24:40;"Nice."
24:40;24:41;"Let's do this."
27:17;27:18;"Beats 1."
27:18;27:22;"Isra Koenig's Time Crisis."
27:22;27:25;"Alright, now welcome to the program, Zach Fox."
27:25;27:26;"What's up, man?"
27:26;27:30;"So you first rose to prominence as @bootymath on Twitter."
27:30;27:31;"Yeah."
27:31;27:33;"And then what, you just outgrew the name?"
27:33;27:34;"No, not necessarily."
27:34;27:42;"It kind of got to a point of I wanted to just be Zach Fox."
27:42;27:43;"You know what I mean?"
27:43;27:44;"People knew me as that."
27:44;27:48;"And literally, like, coming up with the name was so random."
27:48;27:53;"I think I was--I smoked a resin bowl on my, like, friend's couch,"
27:53;27:57;"watching Spice World, and I was like, ""I want to start a Twitter."""
27:57;27:59;"I had never been on social media."
27:59;28:00;"Really?"
28:00;28:01;"What year was this?"
28:01;28:02;"2013."
28:02;28:03;"Oh, okay."
28:03;28:04;"So well into the Twitter era."
28:04;28:05;"Yeah, yeah, well into it."
28:05;28:10;"And I just kind of jumped right in and didn't really know what the"
28:10;28:15;"I was doing, I was kind of just, like, spouting my own humor or whatever."
28:15;28:17;"And you're @bootymath from the start."
28:17;28:20;"From the absolute start, and nothing about that has changed,"
28:20;28:23;"nothing about, you know, my personality has changed over the years."
28:23;28:28;"I was just kind of like, ""Oh, I want to do more [bleep] like that,"""
28:28;28:29;"you know, to a public eye."
28:29;28:32;"I was just like, ""It would be cool to just be myself for a second."""
28:32;28:35;"I think that happened a lot on Twitter."
28:35;28:37;"A lot of people just say, ""You know, I'm just going to be my name."""
28:37;28:38;"Yeah."
28:38;28:39;"""I don't need to be anything."""
28:39;28:40;"I think that's what that was."
28:40;28:44;"So we've got a lot to talk about."
28:44;28:48;"But first, Jake and I just came up with a new segment,"
28:48;28:52;"and if you don't mind, we'd like to christen this segment ""With You."""
28:52;28:53;"Okay."
28:53;28:56;"This segment is called ""What's Your Day-to-Day Like?"""
28:56;28:59;"And I think this is a great way for us to learn more about you"
28:59;29:02;"and for our audience to kind of get more of a sense of who you are."
29:02;29:03;"Okay."
29:03;29:06;"So basically, we're kind of making this up as we go along."
29:06;29:09;"I think the concept is we just want to walk through a typical day with you."
29:09;29:11;"And you just tell us what happens."
29:11;29:12;"Typical weekday."
29:12;29:13;"A typical weekday."
29:13;29:14;"Yeah, that's important."
29:14;29:15;"That's really important."
29:15;29:17;"None of that Saturday, Sunday bullsh--."
29:17;29:18;"That's really important."
29:18;29:24;"We're talking about, like, Tuesday, Wednesday, maybe Monday or Thursday."
29:24;29:25;"Probably not even a Friday."
29:25;29:26;"No."
29:26;29:27;"Okay."
29:27;29:30;"Because my Mondays are really--."
29:30;29:32;"Yeah, some people keep Monday as part of the weekend."
29:32;29:35;"So, okay, let's say, like, on a typical Tuesday or Wednesday,"
29:35;29:37;"the heart of the working week."
29:37;29:38;"Okay."
29:38;29:41;"So we're going to start with waking up."
29:41;29:42;"Okay."
29:42;29:43;"You setting the alarm?"
29:43;29:47;"So I got, like, a natural circadian rhythm."
29:47;29:48;"Really?"
29:48;29:49;"I'm jealous."
29:49;29:51;"That wakes me up, like, 8."
29:51;29:52;"Always."
29:52;29:53;"Pretty much always."
29:53;29:54;"8 to 9."
29:54;29:58;"And if I set an alarm, I wake up three minutes before it."
29:58;29:59;"Always."
29:59;30:00;"Classic."
30:00;30:01;"All the time."
30:01;30:03;"You've just been blessed with a gorgeous circadian rhythm."
30:03;30:05;"It didn't kick in until I was 25."
30:05;30:06;"I'm 26 now."
30:06;30:09;"What about when you were, like, 15, 16?"
30:09;30:10;"Were you, like, typical teenager?"
30:10;30:11;"3 p.m."
30:11;30:12;"3 p.m. I wake up."
30:12;30:13;"Okay."
30:13;30:14;"Yeah."
30:14;30:15;"3 p.m. I used to wake up every day."
30:15;30:16;"So you just grew up."
30:16;30:17;"I was a teenager."
30:17;30:18;"You just became--."
30:18;30:19;"That's when you really became an adult was age 25."
30:19;30:20;"At 25, it just--."
30:20;30:21;"Everything stopped."
30:21;30:22;"Everything fun stopped."
30:22;30:23;"Okay."
30:23;30:25;"But do you go to sleep at a reasonable hour?"
30:25;30:26;"No."
30:26;30:28;"There's a bit of pain to this beautiful circadian rhythm."
30:28;30:29;"Absolutely."
30:29;30:37;"Because the best that I think of or the best that I ever find or do happens between 1 and 5 a.m."
30:37;30:42;"Oh, so sometimes you're just, like, going deep on the internet."
30:42;30:43;"Yeah."
30:43;30:48;"Very deep, stupid going on, and then I'll find, you know, whatever, work on something."
30:48;30:53;"And no matter what time I go to sleep, it typically ends up I wake up at, like, 8 or 9."
30:53;30:55;"So how many hours of sleep are you getting?"
30:55;30:56;"Like, 5, 6?"
30:56;30:57;"Man, 4."
30:57;30:58;"Less?"
30:58;30:59;"Yeah."
30:59;31:00;"I have high blood pressure."
31:00;31:01;"I'm dying."
31:01;31:06;"So 8 a.m., when your circadian rhythm wakes you up, are you, like--."
31:06;31:10;"You wake up, and are you in a bad mood because you're like, ""Damn, I wish I was still sleeping""?"
31:10;31:15;"I wake up, and I usually just thank whoever that I have an erection."
31:15;31:16;"Oh."
31:16;31:18;"This is a family show."
31:18;31:20;"[laughter]"
31:20;31:21;"All right."
31:21;31:22;"Well, fair enough."
31:22;31:24;"To be fair, we asked you what your day-to-day is like."
31:24;31:25;"Everybody's going to be different."
31:25;31:26;"That's the morning."
31:26;31:29;"I woke up this morning and got out of bed."
31:29;31:33;"I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head."
31:33;31:37;"They were the thoughts that came from a wonderful dream."
31:37;31:41;"It was a vision of a world working as a team."
31:41;31:42;"It was a dream."
31:42;31:45;"Twillow."
31:45;31:50;"Just a twillow."
31:50;31:57;"Okay, so I'm always interested in this because I often hang out in bed for a long time between"
31:57;31:59;"when I wake up and when my day really gets started."
31:59;32:00;"In bed."
32:00;32:01;"On the phone."
32:01;32:07;"Yeah, on the phone, reading articles, maybe starting to do some emails or something."
32:07;32:09;"So you wake up."
32:09;32:10;"Then what?"
32:10;32:11;"Are you getting out of bed quickly?"
32:11;32:12;"What are you doing?"
32:12;32:13;"Taking a shower?"
32:13;32:14;"Are you just walking into the kitchen?"
32:14;32:22;"That first emotion is really visceral because the first emotion that I have is we've established"
32:22;32:28;"that it's sexual because I have this almost life-ending erection."
32:28;32:35;"Then the second thought I have is what bad thing happened today or what bad thing happened"
32:35;32:37;"in the time that I was asleep."
32:37;32:38;"I'm not even joking."
32:38;32:39;"In the world, you mean?"
32:39;32:40;"Yeah, I'm like what?"
32:40;32:41;"Like Trump stuff?"
32:41;32:47;"Terrible thing happened and so by this time, three minutes."
32:47;32:48;"You're even hornier."
32:48;32:54;"So my three-minute window of if I've set an alarm yet, if I had set an alarm, the alarm"
32:54;32:57;"is going off, I look at the phone, I check."
32:57;32:58;"This is brutal."
32:58;33:02;"Would you say A.D.M. is your sexual peak?"
33:02;33:04;"I have multiple through the day."
33:04;33:07;"It kind of works like a waveform."
33:07;33:09;"And you're 26."
33:09;33:11;"Yeah."
33:11;33:12;"Oh, to be 26 again."
33:12;33:13;"Oh, God."
33:13;33:14;"To be 26."
33:14;33:15;"We're not at age."
33:15;33:16;"That's morning boners."
33:16;33:17;"I love this."
33:17;33:18;"No, but I like this."
33:18;33:23;"So because these are the things that other radio shows are scared to talk about is just"
33:23;33:26;"the real things that happen in a person's life."
33:26;33:27;"Yeah."
33:27;33:28;"We're being very courageous right now."
33:29;33:30;"So brave."
33:30;33:33;"The lamestream media doesn't cover this type of shit."
33:33;33:35;"So, but I also like this."
33:35;33:37;"I like that we haven't even moved past three minutes."
33:37;33:38;"Yeah, no."
33:38;33:41;"Those are the hardest moments."
33:41;33:43;"No pun intended."
33:43;33:48;"So you wake up, you're in bed, just brutally horny."
33:48;33:49;"Right."
33:49;33:51;"And I wouldn't even say I'm horny."
33:51;33:53;"Okay, horny is not the word."
33:53;33:54;"Horny isn't the word."
33:54;33:55;"It's just filled with."
33:55;33:56;"Yeah, horny is kind of a creepy word."
33:56;33:58;"I actually already wish I didn't say that."
33:58;33:59;"You wake up full of lust."
33:59;34:01;"This is not atypical."
34:01;34:02;"This is part of the human process."
34:02;34:05;"We're not talking about anything controversial here."
34:05;34:06;"And then I'm on my phone."
34:06;34:08;"No, but then you get filled with a sense of dread."
34:08;34:09;"Right."
34:09;34:11;"Dystopian dread."
34:11;34:13;"And then suddenly sex is the furthest thing from your mind?"
34:13;34:14;"Yes."
34:14;34:19;"Okay, so when you start worrying, you wake up and immediately, would you call it anxiety or?"
34:19;34:25;"No, it almost feels, at this point it kind of feels like a game that I'm playing."
34:25;34:29;"It's almost like, well, let's see what moves the opponents made today."
34:29;34:30;"Yeah."
34:30;34:32;"You know, I'm just like, who fucked up?"
34:32;34:35;"Like, who did something that I don't like?"
34:35;34:37;"You don't wake up with anxiety."
34:37;34:39;"That's like, what if you fucked up?"
34:39;34:41;"I don't really experience that."
34:41;34:45;"I usually wake up and I'm like, oh, I'm doing fine."
34:45;34:47;"Oh, that's good."
34:47;34:49;"So you're not like an anxious person."
34:49;34:56;"When it comes to tasks, yes, but overall life, no, I don't wake up like, you know."
34:56;35:00;"But then once you start checking the news, do you feel calm?"
35:00;35:05;"Yeah, I mean, there's only so much that you can fix."
35:05;35:07;"You know, we were just talking about this out there."
35:07;35:11;"There's only so much that you can like on a day to day look at that's bad."
35:11;35:15;"And there's like a hurricane and like ISIS."
35:15;35:20;"It's 830 and I'm like, well, I can't really fix any of this."
35:20;35:23;"Okay, well, are you looking at your phone?"
35:23;35:25;"Did you crack the laptop?"
35:25;35:26;"Are you a tablet guy?"
35:26;35:28;"Are you three screening at this point?"
35:28;35:31;"I do kind of get the screen Trinity going somewhere pretty quickly."
35:31;35:36;"Yeah, phone, phone, screen Trinity, phone, laptop, Netflix."
35:36;35:39;"We're getting into screen Trinity within 15."
35:39;35:40;"No, he's open."
35:40;35:41;"Oh, absolutely."
35:41;35:44;"You crashed out at 430 in a state of screen."
35:44;35:45;"Absolutely."
35:45;35:46;"You sleep three and a half hours."
35:46;35:47;"Yes, I wake up."
35:47;35:48;"You rock hard."
35:48;35:50;"I didn't get back in the screen Trinity."
35:50;35:52;"Yes, yes."
35:52;35:58;"Okay, then how much time might pass once we enter this screen Trinity?"
35:58;35:59;"We're on the next day."
35:59;36:00;"But really you're hanging in bed."
36:00;36:01;"Yeah."
36:01;36:02;"Got the screens cranking."
36:02;36:03;"I'm hanging."
36:03;36:04;"What's the first thing you're checking?"
36:04;36:05;"Just the days."
36:05;36:06;"Twitter?"
36:06;36:07;"Stuff."
36:07;36:12;"All the just pile of that I didn't catch when I went to sleep at 3 a.m."
36:12;36:17;"I just I get all that in so I can be ready for the day."
36:17;36:18;"And then I cook."
36:18;36:23;"You might fire off a tweet before you've even had a bite to eat."
36:23;36:24;"Yeah."
36:24;36:25;"Before you even."
36:25;36:26;"Bars."
36:26;36:27;"Thank you."
36:27;36:28;"Bars."
36:28;36:31;"Before you even tasted some of the sweet."
36:31;36:33;"Ooh."
36:33;36:36;"Before I even ski."
36:36;36:38;"Before you even ski."
36:38;36:39;"You might tweet."
36:39;36:43;"You might."
36:43;36:45;"So you leave the bed."
36:45;36:46;"Yeah."
36:46;36:47;"30 to an hour."
36:47;36:49;"Let's say it's an hour after eyes open."
36:49;36:50;"Yes."
36:50;36:51;"I'm on like 30 percent."
36:51;36:54;"Chubb going down."
36:54;36:57;"Losing steam down there."
36:57;36:58;"Next stop is the kitchen."
36:58;36:59;"Yeah."
36:59;37:00;"Or not the bathroom."
37:00;37:01;"No."
37:01;37:02;"Nine oh five."
37:02;37:03;"You're hitting the kitchen."
37:03;37:04;"Yeah."
37:04;37:05;"What are you looking for?"
37:05;37:06;"Food."
37:06;37:07;"Yeah."
37:07;37:08;"I'm ready to cook."
37:08;37:09;"What do you cook?"
37:09;37:10;"I'm a pretty healthy eater."
37:10;37:12;"So like morning time I'm kind of like a kale bowl."
37:12;37:13;"Oh wow."
37:13;37:16;"With like a fried egg on top."
37:16;37:17;"How long does that take?"
37:17;37:18;"Quite a long time."
37:18;37:20;"If none of those ingredients are prepped."
37:20;37:22;"You have to massage the kale."
37:22;37:23;"You have to massage the kale."
37:23;37:26;"So you're like got to grease the pan."
37:26;37:27;"That's pretty low key."
37:27;37:28;"And then."
37:28;37:29;"Yeah."
37:29;37:30;"It's not."
37:30;37:31;"That's not too hard."
37:31;37:32;"Well see that's."
37:32;37:33;"I don't do kale in the morning but respect."
37:33;37:34;"I need a lot of fiber."
37:34;37:35;"OK."
37:35;37:38;"But so in the morning you're because in the morning I find either I'm not hungry at all"
37:38;37:41;"or I'm so hungry that I couldn't possibly like start cooking."
37:41;37:43;"I'm like violently hungry in the morning."
37:43;37:44;"You're violently hungry."
37:44;37:45;"Yeah."
37:45;37:47;"The morning you're ready to start cooking."
37:47;37:48;"The morning is intense."
37:48;37:52;"The morning is when I'm most everything that a human shouldn't be."
37:52;37:53;"You're lustful."
37:53;37:54;"Lustful."
37:54;37:55;"Starving."
37:55;37:57;"I'll have racist thoughts in the morning."
37:57;37:58;"Racist."
37:58;37:59;"Wow."
37:59;38:02;"Very just terrible murder thoughts because I mean."
38:02;38:04;"Do not talk to me until I've had my quinoa."
38:04;38:05;"Yes."
38:05;38:06;"I'm that person."
38:06;38:07;"I'm going to make a t-shirt for you."
38:07;38:09;"Do not talk to me until I've had my quinoa."
38:09;38:10;"And then on the back."
38:10;38:12;"I might be pretty racist."
40:18;40:23;"Okay, let's say it's a day."
40:23;40:26;"Because I feel like a lot of people listen to Time Crisis can relate to this."
40:26;40:30;"They might all of us have a kind of freelance creative lifestyle."
40:30;40:32;"So we probably have work to do every day."
40:32;40:36;"But it doesn't always mean we have to be in one specific place to do it."
40:36;40:40;"Well, Jake, as a painter, you maybe are kind of often going to the studio."
40:40;40:45;"So let's say it's a day where you don't have any meetings necessarily."
40:45;40:46;"You're not filming anything."
40:46;40:49;"Maybe you have some work to do on the computer."
40:49;40:53;"Are you going to go to like a coffee shop?"
40:53;40:55;"You can go post up a coffee bean?"
40:55;40:57;"Nope. I'm a desk kind of guy."
40:57;41:00;"So I'll just relocate the Trinity over to the desk."
41:00;41:02;"So you have a desk in your home."
41:02;41:08;"Yeah. So that's the place where, you know, I feel most mobility to move."
41:08;41:12;"If I want to draw, I want to edit something, make a mix."
41:12;41:13;"Yeah, whatever."
41:13;41:15;"Okay. So I've never been good at that."
41:15;41:19;"Just like turning your home space into a workspace where you sit down,"
41:19;41:22;"you get the devices popping and you're just doing work."
41:22;41:23;"Right."
41:23;41:27;"And you feel like you can get in the zone and you can really accomplish something that way?"
41:27;41:28;"Oh, yeah."
41:28;41:32;"I mean, sometimes clothes aren't even on at this point."
41:32;41:34;"And that might take you all the way to dinner time or what?"
41:34;41:36;"It might, depending on what happens."
41:36;41:41;"Like the other day I was trying to mix the SpongeBob fun song with the Playboy Cardi song."
41:41;41:44;"And also make a video to it."
41:44;41:49;"So that took up quite a long portion of my day."
41:49;41:52;"And you're just like sitting naked at your desk for four hours?"
41:52;41:56;"Yeah. And I mean, stuff like that will happen just in the spur of the moment."
41:56;41:59;"So let's say your girlfriend was left in the morning."
41:59;42:00;"Yeah."
42:00;42:04;"You wake up, cook breakfast for yourself, you're posted up working at your desk for five hours."
42:04;42:07;"Next thing you know, it's like 5.30 p.m."
42:07;42:08;"She might come back."
42:08;42:12;"And then she comes back and you're like, ""Great. It's another beautiful day."""
42:12;42:16;"Another day. Let's have a glass of rose. And then I cook dinner for her."
42:16;42:17;"Okay."
42:17;42:18;"Yeah."
42:18;42:20;"By that point, you guys are just happy to see each other."
42:20;42:23;"And she's probably exhausted from her working."
42:23;42:25;"So you're not trying to go anywhere."
42:25;42:27;"You're just enjoying each other's company."
42:27;42:29;"And then she falls asleep and then you have--"
42:29;42:31;"We might watch an episode like--"
42:31;42:33;"Four hours of 4chan until--"
42:33;42:34;"Yeah."
42:34;42:35;"[laughter]"
42:35;42:36;"Yeah."
42:36;42:37;"Precisely."
42:37;42:38;"But then the day really starts."
42:38;42:41;"You were talking about those hours between 1 and 5."
42:41;42:44;"I'm assuming that she's asleep if she left the house early."
42:44;42:47;"Yeah. And it's really weird because we live in a really small space."
42:47;42:50;"So I have to be kind of quiet with what I'm doing."
42:50;42:51;"So--"
42:51;42:53;"Okay. So I'm picturing this."
42:53;42:55;"I don't know if people could picture this."
42:55;42:57;"You and your partner are in a bed together."
42:57;42:58;"Yes."
42:58;43:02;"That person, because they're on a pretty different schedule, out cold."
43:02;43:05;"Out cold. I have big-ass headphones on."
43:05;43:08;"Like big, big-ass headphones."
43:08;43:09;"Beats by Dre?"
43:09;43:10;"Yes."
43:10;43:12;"So you got your Beats by Dre on."
43:12;43:14;"You're just on your phone for, like, hours at night?"
43:14;43:15;"Yeah."
43:15;43:18;"You say you're getting into some dark [bleep] between 1 and 5."
43:18;43:19;"Oh, yeah."
43:19;43:21;"What are you looking at? You're looking at Twitter?"
43:21;43:24;"You're looking at-- are you on message boards?"
43:24;43:25;"Yeah, sometimes."
43:25;43:27;"Like, what's a dark message board you look at?"
43:27;43:29;"Give me some specifics from the last few days."
43:29;43:31;"Last night, 2 a.m., what are you hitting?"
43:31;43:33;"I can't even really talk about that."
43:33;43:35;"Oh, my God. Now I'm really interested."
43:35;43:37;"[laughter]"
43:37;43:42;"2 a.m.-- does your girlfriend know that at 2 a.m., while she's sleeping,"
43:42;43:46;"you're looking at such weird [bleep] on your phone that you can't even say it?"
43:46;43:48;"She must wake up sometimes and just be like, ""What are you doing?"""
43:48;43:51;"Yeah, no, she'll wake up and she'll just be like, ""[bleep] damn it."""
43:51;43:57;"Or she'll just-- because I try to stifle my laughter a lot of times,"
43:57;44:01;"so if I'm laughing at something, she'll just feel my chest moving."
44:01;44:03;"She's a very light sleeper, so she'll just be like, ""Stop."""
44:03;44:04;"Right."
44:04;44:08;"But recently I found this website-- I didn't find it recently, I'm lying."
44:08;44:15;"I found it back in, like, 2010, but it's recently in the span of things,"
44:15;44:23;"and it's called Chaotic, and it's basically the YouTube of snuff on the Internet."
44:23;44:26;"So anything bad that happened in the world--"
44:26;44:27;"This is dark."
44:27;44:30;"Yeah, anything bad that happened in the world that day,"
44:30;44:34;"like that I woke up and saw a headline about,"
44:34;44:39;"I can be sure to go on that website and find actual video footage of it."
44:39;44:42;"And this is just a regular website? You don't need to use Tor?"
44:42;44:44;"No, no Tor."
44:44;44:47;"So what keeps you wanting to see the new ones?"
44:47;44:49;"Like, you're searching for, like--"
44:49;44:54;"This weird, like, [bleep] that movie with damn--"
44:54;44:57;"What is that boy's name?"
44:57;44:59;"What is that boy's name?"
44:59;45:01;"Nightcrawler. It's like this weird--"
45:01;45:02;"Oh, okay, Jill and Hall."
45:02;45:05;"Jill and Hall, Jill and Hallion."
45:05;45:07;"I think we've all been there one way or another."
45:07;45:11;"There is that weird feeling of, like, late at night, you're looking at something dark."
45:11;45:12;"Yeah."
45:12;45:15;"Well, there's this feeling of, here in America,"
45:15;45:22;"we're so, so, so, so drastically removed from the actual brutality of these events."
45:22;45:26;"So one might call it, like, you know, this weird, sick voyeurism,"
45:26;45:32;"but is it voyeurism when someone who is actually in that environment has to see it happen?"
45:32;45:34;"Because that happens a lot, every single day."
45:34;45:39;"No, you could totally make a case that you're just, like, experiencing the world as it is."
45:39;45:41;"Yeah, and I really feel like that's what it is."
45:41;45:42;"I know--"
45:42;45:46;"I actually want to see what happened, and it's never--"
45:46;45:47;"So 2 a.m., you're--"
45:47;45:48;"--enjoying it."
45:48;45:50;"Right, so 2 a.m., you're looking at--"
45:50;45:54;"How many-- You might be on this site for, like, hours, or you're just, like--"
45:54;45:55;"I can't handle it, man."
45:55;45:56;"A tight 15."
45:56;45:58;"I can't handle it, and that's just, like--"
45:58;46:02;"Because I'm a soft American, I don't know, but a lot of times I'll look at--"
46:02;46:04;"So you're almost, like, testing yourself, in a way."
46:04;46:07;"Can you actually handle the brutality of the world?"
46:07;46:12;"Yeah, and I feel like 99% of people here in this country probably couldn't."
46:12;46:15;"So in a way, when you go on this website, it's, like--"
46:15;46:17;"It's a really hardcore way of getting the news."
46:17;46:18;"Absolutely."
49:27;49:30;"There's some Bruce Springsteen song."
49:30;49:32;"I think it's called ""Wreck on the Highway."""
49:32;49:34;"Or ""Stolen Car."" He has so many songs--"
49:34;49:38;"""Wreck on the Highway"" is when he finds the kid who got in the car accident"
49:38;49:40;"dying on the side of the road."
49:40;49:43;"I think in the song, it's Bruce Springsteen or the narrator or whatever"
49:43;49:47;"driving home, Jersey Turnpike-- Yeah, bless you--"
49:47;49:49;"and sees some horrible accident."
49:49;49:51;"He sees a kid dying or something."
49:51;49:54;"And I feel like the end of the song is that then the kid dies,"
49:54;49:55;"there's nothing he can do."
49:55;49:59;"Then he drives home and looks at his children sleeping."
49:59;50:01;"He gets in the bed next to his wife."
50:01;50:05;"And she's sleeping peacefully, and he looks at her,"
50:05;50:08;"and she's oblivious and serene and peaceful."
50:08;50:10;"And he's just like, ""I just saw this."""
50:10;50:14;"In his head, he's trying to reconcile this grisly death he saw on the side"
50:14;50:19;"of the highway with his serene lady friend."
50:19;50:21;"It's ""Wreck on the Highway."" It's on the river."
50:21;50:22;"Last track, great song."
50:22;50:24;"Last track on the river."
50:24;50:26;"So, Zach, you could do kind of a version now."
50:26;50:28;"You wouldn't even need to do all that."
50:28;50:29;"You wouldn't need to be driving."
50:29;50:32;"Bruce Springsteen, dumbass, didn't have Wi-Fi."
50:32;50:36;"♪ I watched a genocidal video on my phone ♪"
50:36;50:42;"♪ I was scrolling through LiveLeak on my iPhone 6 ♪"
50:42;50:45;"♪ My girlfriend was sleeping ♪"
50:45;50:51;"♪ She had no idea what happened to that Russian truck driver ♪"
50:51;50:54;"♪ This morning in Moscow ♪"
50:54;50:58;"Do you ever look over at her and see her sleeping serenely?"
50:58;51:00;"Just like mouth open, just like crashed out."
51:00;51:02;"Oh, she's so cute when she's sleeping, too."
51:02;51:05;"She's just so like-- she doesn't even snore."
51:05;51:07;"She's just me, me, me, me, me, me, me."
51:07;51:08;"And I'm like seeing like--"

01:21:03;01:21:05;"- I was like, it already is."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"Yeah."
01:21:06;01:21:10;"♪ But you and I will be alone ♪"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"♪ I'll be with you from dusk till dawn ♪"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"- Who listens to this?"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"This is--like, what is the context"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"that you would put this on in?"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"- I don't know, maybe--"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"- Like, I don't know if this is a sex song."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"Is it a-- - No."
01:21:22;01:21:26;"- Can you imagine just, like, making dinner to this?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- You know what?"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"This is supposed to be on, like--"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"- I think this song is supposed to be, like--"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"- On a TV show. - Right."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"- With somebody-- - Like, closing credits."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"- Yeah, or, like, a very dramatic moment."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"Somebody just broke up, and they're going somewhere."
01:21:37;01:21:40;"- But people are buying this single on iTunes for $1.29."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"- We'll see if this is a real hit,"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"because, you know, artists like Zayn,"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"they're so big that their songs"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"always end up in the top five."
01:21:46;01:21:47;"- Right. - But sometimes"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"they slip right out, too."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"- Right, I think this is gonna--"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"- This is the part of the episode"
01:21:51;01:21:54;"where Kim is mad at Kourtney."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"- Yeah."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"- And Kourtney drives away in an SUV,"
01:21:57;01:22:00;"and Kim sits there on her phone."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"I just don't understand"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"why Kourtney can't just get it."
01:22:05;01:22:09;"And that's just-- it's so frustrating."
01:22:09;01:22:13;"- The credits are rolling, like, at crazy speed on the left."

01:22:23;01:22:24;"""right now for $1.29."""
01:22:24;01:22:25;"- We'll see. - I'd eat that."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"- But I want to point this out to everybody."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"I'm not hatin', 'cause you know that I love all music."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- I'm gonna listen to that tomorrow morning"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"on my soul-crushing commute."
01:22:34;01:22:39;"- That every time-- you gotta remember this, people."
01:22:39;01:22:40;"That you look at the top five."
01:22:40;01:22:41;"Some of these artists, these artists,"
01:22:41;01:22:44;"these big artists like the Zayns of the world,"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"they're struggling just like you."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"- Real people."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"- Yeah, they might have $65 million."
01:22:48;01:22:49;"- Real people."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- But he has acrophobia."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"But also, these artists, we kind of assume"
01:22:52;01:22:55;"that these big artists, they're just, like, rock solid."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"And yes, he can put out a song that's in the top five"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"of the billion. - Rock hard."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"- But we'll see."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"I'm curious."
01:23:02;01:23:03;"Jen, I want everybody to think about this."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"You just heard part of the new Zayn single."

01:23:14;01:23:15;"Is this a genuine hit,"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"or is this just, like, a big person dropping a song?"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"We'll find out."
01:23:19;01:23:20;"I'm curious."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"- We'll keep an eye on it."
01:23:22;01:23:23;"You're on Time Crisis."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"- I'm watching you, Zayn."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"- We're keeping an eye on Zayn, Dusk 'Til Dawn."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"I like the name."
01:23:28;01:23:31;"The number two song--oh, this is a good song."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"I actually haven't heard in a while."
01:23:32;01:23:35;"The number two song in 1980, ""Air Supply,"" ""All Outta Love."""

01:24:48;01:24:50;"- I don't think they are, but I could be wrong."

01:25:19;01:25:20;"- Uh-oh."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"- We're getting a lot of new music in the top five"

01:25:25;01:25:28;"So, Jake, do you know which major artist"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"came back over the past couple weeks"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"who'd been gone for a long time?"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"- Give me a hint."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"- Legacy artists or, like, new--newish?"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"- Ugh, debatable. - Mm."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"- Caucasian female. - In between."

01:25:42;01:25:43;"- [laughs]"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- Do you know, Zach?"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"- You just said it, and I immediately was like,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"""Yes, I know who it is."""
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Well, I have two people in mind."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"- Who could it be?"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"- Either one, I'm mad. - What Caucasian females"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"came back?"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- Adele? - No."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"- So the first person who came on my mind"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"when I said, ""Oh, [bleep]"" was Pink,"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"and I was, like, about to just leave."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- Oh, she did come back recently."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"- But Taylor Swift."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"- It's Taylor Swift. - Oh, yeah, okay."
01:26:06;01:26:09;"Taylor Swift is far out, man."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"[laughter]"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"- Oh, Taylor Speck, that's pretty cool, man."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"- Oh, just got a new record, okay."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"- Oh, great."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"- [bleep]"
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- Do you think there are any, like,"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"old Lebowski hippies who just, like--"
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- Oh, Taylor!"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"- They're just, like--yeah, they just, like,"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"work at a health food store, and they just, like--"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"the kids play pop music, and just, like--"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"just 'cause they're in prison there,"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"they just kind of get into it, and they're just like,"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"""Oh, hey, Randy, what's this one?"""
01:26:33;01:26:35;"""It's the new Taylor Swift, Tony."""
01:26:35;01:26:38;"""Oh, that's pretty cool, Taylor Speck."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"""Nice, you got a new old record coming out?"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"""I'll have to check that out."""
01:26:41;01:26:43;"- I'll just comment for a second and say, like,"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"we've talked about it."
01:26:45;01:26:49;"Like, I would rather seek out ISIS videos at night"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"than, like, go listen to what Taylor Swift--"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"- Wait, you don't like Taylor Swift?"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"- No. - Why not?"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"I thought everybody liked Taylor Swift."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"Well, okay. - Okay, Ezra."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"[laughter]"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"- Taylor's back. That's pretty cool, Zach."
01:27:03;01:27:07;"You're gonna go to the concert when she comes to town, man."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"- I just--man."
01:27:08;01:27:12;"- Okay, so Taylor Swift is a very controversial figure."
01:27:12;01:27:16;"She is the most popular musician in America"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"by certain metrics."
01:27:17;01:27:22;"I think in 2017, there's almost a direct correlation."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"The more popular you are,"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"the more, like, viscerally other people hate you."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"- Yeah."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"- Okay, so, Zach, have you always hated Taylor Swift?"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"- Yes. - Always."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"She always rubbed you the wrong way?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"- Actually, no."
01:27:32;01:27:36;"There was a period of time where I really did find her endearing."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"What's the one song? The one big one where she was--"
01:27:39;01:27:43;"♪ Don't you see that I'm the one who understands you ♪"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"- Oh. Yeah, okay. - You should be with me."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"- You should be with me."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"- Like, that era of Taylor Swift,"
01:27:48;01:27:51;"I was like, ""Man, I really-- I'm [bleep] with this girl."""
01:27:51;01:27:53;"- But not the pop era."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"- Uh, no, nothing past that."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Yeah."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Like, when Kanye got up at the VMAs,"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"I was like, ""Oh, my God, yes!"""
01:28:00;01:28:01;"- Right."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"- And, you know, the general consensus"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"was that he shouldn't have done that,"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"but that was before Twitter was really popping."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- Right."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"- 'Cause if that had happened yesterday,"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"everybody would have been like, ""Thank you."""
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- Right, yeah, no question. - Thank you."
01:28:13;01:28:16;"- Yeah, it's amazing to think that there was this moment"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"when even the--"
01:28:17;01:28:21;"Remember, even Obama had to say that Kanye was a jackass."
01:28:21;01:28:22;"- Yeah."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"- Because at that moment,"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"the gloves hadn't come off in America."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"It hadn't been masked off yet."
01:28:28;01:28:33;"So the idea that however right Kanye may have been,"
01:28:33;01:28:36;"that Taylor Swift winning the award over Beyoncé"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"for ""Single Ladies"" was absurd,"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"America still had some vague sense of--"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"- Decorum. - Decorum."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"- Yeah."
01:28:42;01:28:45;"- That even Obama had to be like, ""Stiff upper lip."""
01:28:45;01:28:48;"Well, that was a jackass thing to do."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"You can't just run on stage."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- Yeah, he didn't have the support group"
01:28:51;01:28:55;"that he and a lot of other musicians"
01:28:55;01:28:58;"don't really realize that they have."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"- Right. - Living on the internet."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- Before that, it would have been"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"all out warfare on Twitter."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Some people would have been like,"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"""He shouldn't have done that,"""
01:29:03;01:29:04;"and other people would have been like,"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"""He shouldn't have done that."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"""She shouldn't have f---ing got him to accept that award"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"""'cause it's so stupid,"" you know, right?"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"- Exactly. - It would have been very--"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"That's interesting."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"If that moment had happened in the social media--"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- And when he said that George Bush"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"doesn't care about black people."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"If that had happened yesterday,"
01:29:15;01:29:18;"people would have been like, ""Yeah, okay, cool."""
01:29:18;01:29:20;"- But I feel like even that one,"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"at least for liberal people,"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"they were kind of like, ""Great for him for speaking out,"""
01:29:23;01:29:25;"but even when he ran up on stage with Taylor Swift,"
01:29:25;01:29:29;"even kind of like Kanye apologists had to be like,"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"""Okay, fair enough."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"""It's not right to run on stage at an awards show."""
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Whereas 2017, it's like, ""Who cares?"""
01:29:34;01:29:35;"- Yeah. - Run on stage"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"at the awards show, it doesn't matter."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"So anyway, all of that is a good lead-up to this song"

01:47:36;01:47:38;"painful feelings, and that's like a real--"
01:47:38;01:47:41;"that's a real moment that we all have."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"Like, I'm sure anybody's had a breakup"
01:47:43;01:47:44;"where they like said something like nasty"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"when they're so upset or angry."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"It's not a good look."
01:47:48;01:47:50;"That's a great example of a time in life"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"where you're feeling strong emotions"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"and you gotta challenge yourself to be cool"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"and recognize everybody's humanity"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"and recognize like people make their own decisions and stuff."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"- Where's this at with the TTL?"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"- Oh, in terms of tone, touch, and lyricism?"
01:48:03;01:48:04;"- I'm gonna go--"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- Well, there's basically no guitar on it."
01:48:06;01:48:10;"- No tone, no touch, no lyricism."
01:48:10;01:48:15;"I'm gonna go eight on tone, zero on touch."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- No touch."
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Well, yeah, this song really lacks touch"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"'cause it's like--"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"it's not like a wheelhouse rhythmically, I guess."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"- I'm straining to care."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"I don't know how to take--"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"- I know a lot of my music industry professional friends"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"have made this case to me where they're kind of like,"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"so many people are talking about Taylor Swift is back"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"and a lot of people are hating, being like,"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"""Oh, her new songs suck,"""
01:48:36;01:48:39;"and I've heard people go, ""Yeah, you know what?"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"""I think her nine-year-old fans, they're loving it."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"""They love it and they don't care."""
01:48:44;01:48:47;"- I mean, if that's what you want to do, go for it."
01:48:47;01:48:50;"- You pan her to your base, man."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"- Yeah."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"- Trump style."
01:48:53;01:48:54;"- I mean, look at Trump."
01:48:54;01:48:58;"I mean, people hate him."
01:48:58;01:49:02;"Hate him, but he has his base."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"And, you know--"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"- They're loyal."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"- Even with like--"
01:49:05;01:49:06;"- All you need is base."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"- Base, base, base."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"- Can you hit that bass line again?"
01:49:10;01:49:13;"- Bow, bow, prowl."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"- All you need is base."
01:49:15;01:49:18;"- Wow, wow, wow, wow."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"- All you need is base."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"- But I mean, even if you're like a big musician,"
01:49:22;01:49:26;"even if like 90% of the audience hates you"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"and like 10% loves you,"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"I'm talking about the general public."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"- Right, I mean--"
01:49:31;01:49:32;"- That's like still huge."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- Well, also--"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"- So it's like--"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"- Still making money."
01:49:35;01:49:36;"- You know what's crazy?"
01:49:36;01:49:39;"I can't believe like how many just like liberal people I know."
01:49:39;01:49:42;"And again, I don't like making it personally about Taylor Swift"
01:49:42;01:49:45;"because she's a symbol above all else."
01:49:45;01:49:48;"You know, there's a human being beneath this crazy facade"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"of being the most famous pop star."
01:49:49;01:49:53;"What's more interesting to me is not her or what she's doing."
01:49:53;01:49:57;"It's the way that she makes the people around her act bananas."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"I've had so many conversations where people are kind of like,"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"yeah, she could have gone on some kind vibe [bleep]"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"but she knew that if she just came out hard,"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"her base would love it,"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"the songs would go to the top of the charts,"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"and she could just go make a bunch more money."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"And you got, you know, at the end of the day,"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"what you will about Taylor Swift,"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"she's out there getting money."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"Some part of it is like, oh, who cares?"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"- Yeah."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"- Those are some of my least favorite conversations"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"where people are like, well, you got to give it to them."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- Yeah."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"- It's like, no, I don't."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"- If you got to give it to Taylor,"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"you got to give it to Trump."
01:50:25;01:50:26;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"- And again, even with Trump, even with psycho Trump--"
01:50:28;01:50:32;"- I don't think it's fair for us to go full Taylor Trump comparison."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"- I'm fine with it."
01:50:33;01:50:35;"- Well, let's let Zach do it."
01:50:35;01:50:38;"- If she starts running for president as a Republican,"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"then we can talk."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"- What if she runs for president as a Democrat?"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"- I guess it depends what the platform is."
01:50:45;01:50:46;"- Oh, okay, you know what?"
01:50:46;01:50:47;"I will say this."
01:50:47;01:50:50;"I don't think we need to, like, destroy people,"
01:50:50;01:50:53;"but I do think if you were over the age of 18"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"and you did not, even in a small way,"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"publicly take a stand against Trump,"
01:50:58;01:51:01;"I'm not writing you off for the rest of your life,"
01:51:01;01:51:03;"but maybe you should never run for office."
01:51:03;01:51:05;"Can we at least agree on that?"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"Even if I met an 18-year-old who's like,"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"you know what, man, in my mid-20s,"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"I chilled out a little bit, I'd still be like,"
01:51:10;01:51:11;"okay, that's fine."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"You could do my taxes."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"We could go to the barbecue together."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"You can't run for Senate."
01:51:17;01:51:19;"Even if by the time you're 30,"
01:51:19;01:51:20;"you become a hardcore socialist,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"I'm not saying you're a bad person."
01:51:22;01:51:23;"I'm glad that you changed your mind."
01:51:23;01:51:24;"- You're saying there's something empty"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"at the core of your moral--"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"- No, this is what I've always believed."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"I believe that in our society,"
01:51:29;01:51:30;"we're too hard on celebrities,"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"'cause at the end of the day, who cares?"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"- Yeah. - They're just a bunch of goofballs"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"who happen to be able to sing"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"or have a symmetrical face or whatever."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Like, let them just be dumb people."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"And I think we're almost weirdly"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"not hard enough on politicians."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"And I know that sounds crazy,"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"'cause people are like, we're so hard on politicians,"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"but I'm saying, like, we need to be hard"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"on our own politicians."
01:51:50;01:51:53;"If you're a Republican, obviously,"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"even Trump doesn't reflect your real values,"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"so, like, have some [bleep]"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"like Marco Rubio or something."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"And if you're a Democrat,"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"if you truly believe that the rich people"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"are ruining America, like, don't vote for rich people."
01:52:04;01:52:08;"- Senator Koenig on his radio show in 2017"
01:52:08;01:52:10;"called out Senator Swift on--"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"- I'm not gonna run either."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I don't like it."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"I don't like politics. It's too dirty."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"I'll call it right here."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"I'm never running for public office."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"- All right, fair."
01:52:19;01:52:20;"- Okay, I might sit on the board"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"of, like, a corporation or something."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"But rather than try to get into these, like,"
01:52:25;01:52:26;"deep moral issues,"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"is Taylor Swift a good person or a bad person?"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"I don't know."
01:52:29;01:52:32;"Like, if you told me that a person with a platform"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"kept their damn mouth shut"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"when a [bleep] white supremacist"
01:52:35;01:52:36;"was about to become president,"
01:52:36;01:52:39;"maybe they had a good reason behind closed doors."
01:52:39;01:52:42;"I can't say for certain that they're a terrible person."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"All I can say is that they can keep singing their songs,"
01:52:45;01:52:49;"but they're fully disqualified from running for office."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"That's all, right? Isn't that fair?"
01:52:51;01:52:54;"- So you're saying if Quavo ran for president..."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"- Did Quavo keep his mouth shut?"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"- 100%."
01:52:57;01:52:58;"- Quavius kept his mouth shut?"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"He didn't say a word about Trump?"
01:52:59;01:53:01;"- Quavius Marshall didn't say anything about the president."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"So if he ran..."
01:53:02;01:53:04;"- No, I wouldn't, because think about it."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"There's so many more experienced people."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"- I vote for Quavo."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"- We should really minimize celebrities running for office,"
01:53:10;01:53:13;"and I think people who kept their mouths shut"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"during an obvious decision point,"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"as George Bush would say,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"probably don't need to be politicians."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Is that so bad?"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"- Fair."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"- And I would hold the same standard for Taylor Swift"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"as for Migos,"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"and it's a lot harder for me to say the second part."
01:53:27;01:53:29;"- It's real hard, but you're right."
01:53:29;01:53:32;"- Weirdly, I'm trying to be go-easy on Taylor Swift, in a way."
01:53:32;01:53:33;"I'm just trying to be like,"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"what does it really mean that she didn't say anything"
01:53:35;01:53:36;"during the election?"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"What should the consequences of that be?"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"Should she be banished from polite society?"
01:53:41;01:53:44;"Should we say it's wrong for people to be fans of her?"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"That seems a bit extreme."
01:53:45;01:53:48;"- I guess people feel like she's in the biggest room"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"with the most white people,"
01:53:50;01:53:55;"so maybe if she had just said a little something."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"- No, no, you're right, you're right."
01:53:57;01:53:58;"She should've."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"- Maybe."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"- No, no, no, no, you're right, you're right."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"She should've. I agree. I agree."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"- People who are saying that"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"to play devil's advocate or whatever,"
01:54:06;01:54:09;"they're probably like, bro, you, like,"
01:54:09;01:54:13;"Taylor Swift in the room with the most white people."
01:54:13;01:54:16;"- With great power comes great responsibility."
01:54:16;01:54:19;"- She, as this crossover red state to blue state"
01:54:19;01:54:20;"country to pop person,"
01:54:20;01:54:24;"truly has the ears of more white people than anybody."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"- And Miley, you know,"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"despite some [bleep] she did recently"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"that was kind of whack,"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"but, like, she was very-- she was outspoken"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"and went against the grain."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- So is Katy Perry."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"So that's another thing."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"All of her-- so I guess, you know,"
01:54:36;01:54:37;"I'm not trying to say that I don't think"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"she should've spoken out."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"I truly do."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"I guess what I'm saying is, moving forward,"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"what should the consequences be"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"for a celebrity who didn't speak out?"
01:54:45;01:54:48;"- Well, it was a pretty unique election."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"Like, if Taylor Swift didn't say anything"
01:54:50;01:54:54;"about Mitt Romney in 2012, we wouldn't care."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"- Maybe we should care."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"- Well, I don't know."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"I think that was a pretty unique--"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"- It was a unique election."
01:55:00;01:55:03;"- I mean, hopefully it remains a unique election."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"- We'll see about that."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"I just want to go out with one song that I heard recently,"
01:55:08;01:55:11;"and maybe you'll appreciate this 'cause you like '80s R&B,"
01:55:11;01:55:15;"but my friend Dave Maklovich played this for me,"
01:55:15;01:55:18;"so do you like cameo?"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"- I love cameo."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- Well, this is not cameo."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"Sorry."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"[laughter]"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Do you like Morris Day?"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- Yeah, of course."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"- What about the time?"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"- Of course."
01:55:28;01:55:30;"- Okay, so Morris Day and the Time,"
01:55:30;01:55:31;"you're familiar, kind of--"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"- Yeah."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"- Everybody knows what they were doing"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"in the '80s with Prince."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"- Yeah."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"- What were they doing in 1990?"
01:55:36;01:55:37;"- I have no idea."
01:55:37;01:55:40;"- They dropped an album called ""Pandemonium,"""
01:55:40;01:55:43;"where it looks like the band is standing on a waffle,"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"but they had a song on ""Pandemonium"""
01:55:45;01:55:46;"that I'd never heard before,"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"and even during all this Donald Trump nonsense,"
01:55:48;01:55:49;"the song had never come up."
01:55:49;01:55:52;"- Wow, the band is literally standing on a frying pan."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- Oh, on a frying pan."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"- With chicken legs floating around it."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"- It's a crazy album cover."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"Look it up, the Time ""Pandemonium."""
01:55:59;01:56:02;"But so the Time dropped a song in 1990,"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"and somehow I'd never heard about it"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"until a couple weeks ago from Dave"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"called ""Donald Trump Black Version."""
01:56:08;01:56:09;"- Wow."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"- Whoa."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"- And it's like a sexy song,"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"and he's telling this girl what she needs,"
