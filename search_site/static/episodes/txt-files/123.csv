00:00;00:04;"Hey everybody, Time Crisis in a time of crisis."
00:04;00:06;"We're back."
00:06;00:08;"We're not going to do the ABBA this week."
00:08;00:09;"We wanted to come back."
00:09;00:10;"We want to do an episode."
00:10;00:13;"We want to talk to each other and talk to other people."
00:13;00:15;"Obviously this is a very serious moment."
00:15;00:20;"So we wanted to come back with an episode, but make sure we got to talk about what's"
00:20;00:24;"going on and really think through some of the issues of the day."
00:24;00:25;"It's going to be an interesting episode."
00:25;00:30;"We got some interesting guests and of course some friends of the show."
00:30;00:31;"So here we go."
00:31;00:32;"Check it out."
00:32;00:36;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:36;00:40;"We should address that we did record a show for last week."
00:40;00:44;"It was a very good show and I think we'll probably drop it this coming week, but we"
00:44;00:52;"wanted to do a slightly more real time one first because we recorded that show just before"
00:52;00:58;"the big protests began and suddenly it felt like a totally different moment that should"
00:58;01:02;"not be impeded in any way by our discussion of the Chunky Dunkies."
01:02;01:04;"But it was a decent episode."
01:04;01:07;"Just dropping it that Sunday did not feel right."
01:07;01:14;"Yeah, we were talking about doors, cover bands, and it was very frivolous, very TC."
01:14;01:18;"The only thing I'll say is that we were weirdly ahead of the curve with the Chunky Dunkies."
01:18;01:20;"That's why we were talking about them again."
01:20;01:24;"You'll hear in that next episode, that'll be a on demand episode."
01:24;01:28;"You'll hear about the extent to which the Chunky Dunkies really blew up."
01:28;01:31;"But anyway, we've got some good guests today."
01:31;01:36;"First we're going to have Alex S. Vitale, who wrote this book, The End of Policing."
01:36;01:39;"So he'll be very interesting to talk to."
01:39;01:44;"And then we also have a friend of the show, Kid Mero and Winter, who's back on the road"
01:44;01:45;"starbucking again."
01:45;01:50;"So three different takes on the state of America today."
01:50;01:52;"What's your vibe been the past week, Jake?"
01:52;01:53;"You were taking it to the streets, right?"
01:53;01:58;"Yeah, I went on Tuesday downtown to City Hall."
01:58;02:00;"There was a big march there."
02:00;02:01;"Did you make a sign?"
02:01;02:02;"It was great."
02:02;02:03;"Didn't show up with a sign."
02:03;02:04;"Interesting."
02:04;02:08;"You have all the skills to make a great sign in American history."
02:08;02:09;"That's true."
02:09;02:13;"Well, I just thought I would just kind of show up and just kind of be one among the"
02:13;02:15;"masses walking along."
02:15;02:16;"I planned it a little more."
02:16;02:17;"I could have done something."
02:17;02:22;"I really like your painting of a staples in front of that mountain."
02:22;02:24;"I think I understand how that relates to the protest."
02:24;02:25;"I'm not entirely sure."
02:25;02:26;"Right."
02:26;02:27;"Just holding up a canvas."
02:27;02:29;"Just a painting that you..."
02:29;02:35;"I mean, there's a pretty cute picture that always circulates during protest times of"
02:35;02:40;"a little kid holding up a piece of cardboard where they did a little child's kind of abstract"
02:40;02:41;"expressionist scribble."
02:41;02:43;"He's holding it up."
02:43;02:47;"And there is something kind of like sweet about that where it's like, you know what?"
02:47;02:49;"Maybe there is some meaning in abstraction."
02:49;02:50;"I could see that."
02:50;02:53;"I could see if you were like, if you just were holding a sign with like a drawing of"
02:53;02:55;"like some daisies or something."
02:55;02:56;"Yeah."
02:56;03:02;"We were shown by a few people, somebody holding what appeared to be a painter's canvas, except"
03:02;03:05;"I don't know if it was on the front, but what we can see from the back said, what was it?"
03:05;03:07;"Fish heads for black lives?"
03:07;03:08;"I think so."
03:08;03:09;"Yeah."
03:09;03:11;"Fish fans for BLM or something like that."
03:11;03:12;"All right."
03:12;03:13;"Let's send that to the fish community."
03:13;03:15;"I mean, we've wondered this before."
03:15;03:21;"Like we've talked about the fact that there are some like shockingly, like very high profile"
03:21;03:24;"right wing fans of the Grateful Dead."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:26;"Like Ann Coulter."
03:26;03:27;"Yeah."
03:27;03:28;"Which seems so bizarre."
03:28;03:33;"I mean, I noticed when I was checking out Twitter last week, when there were protests"
03:33;03:39;"in Nashville, there were some rumors that the Ryman Theater was getting defaced or looted"
03:39;03:40;"or something."
03:40;03:42;"And I know that Ryman Theater is a beloved venue."
03:42;03:46;"Vampire Weekends played there a few times and know it well."
03:46;03:50;"And I don't think in the end anything really happened there, but it was just like that"
03:50;03:53;"type of like rumor that flies around to get people worked up."
03:53;03:55;"Be like, are you kidding me?"
03:55;03:57;"How does messing up the rhyme and help anything?"
03:57;03:58;"Oh my God."
03:58;04:01;"You know, and I did see this one person who was like, I just was like scrolling through"
04:01;04:06;"comments, which I try not to do too much because it truly destroys your brain."
04:06;04:11;"But I saw this one image, somebody had like a steely for their image and they were just"
04:11;04:13;"like, oh, hell no."
04:13;04:15;"If anybody f***s up the Ryman Theater, it's on."
04:15;04:20;"And I was just like, is this truly just like a Nashville based deadhead who's just like"
04:20;04:22;"anti protester?"
04:22;04:25;"Or maybe they're just like such a big deadhead."
04:25;04:27;"They're just like such a fan of live music that they're just like, guys, burn down a"
04:27;04:31;"police station, but do not mess with live music venues."
04:31;04:34;"But there's something like weird about seeing like the still your face with this kind of"
04:34;04:37;"like, what the f*** are these protesters doing kind of moment."
04:37;04:40;"There's going to be a big age range within the dead community."
04:40;04:45;"So you're going to get maybe some older folks not down with the civil unrest."
04:45;04:51;"I would love to see if the Phish fan community lean slightly to the left of the dead community."
04:51;04:56;"I mean, you just imagine they're slightly younger just because it's a generational thing."
04:56;05:02;"You'd imagine it'd be like slightly like you can picture that dude who is huge deadhead"
05:02;05:07;"in his 20s and 30s like original deadhead doing acid and stuff."
05:07;05:12;"And now he's got the kind of like, I don't know, like wearing Oakley's and kind of like"
05:12;05:13;"angry."
05:13;05:15;"And this is one thought that I've had recently."
05:15;05:19;"I mean, well, I guess we should say first of all, anybody's listen to Time Crisis when"
05:19;05:21;"we talk about serious stuff."
05:21;05:25;"I think you won't be surprised to know that people like me and Jake are obviously in support"
05:25;05:28;"of the protesters and find Black Lives Matter."
05:28;05:32;"Obviously, we're not into any of that all lives matter garbage, which is I've never"
05:32;05:36;"seen a single person say that and like truly mean it anyway."
05:36;05:40;"And I think obviously these examples of police brutality, the reason people are in the streets"
05:40;05:42;"is because they're so cut and dry."
05:42;05:45;"Nobody would accept that happening to somebody that they knew."
05:45;05:47;"And you shouldn't accept that happening to a stranger."
05:47;05:51;"But I mean, it's been making me think so much as I'm sure everybody has about just like"
05:51;05:54;"cops in general, the concept of cops."
05:54;05:59;"And when I think about like the aging deadhead who maybe somehow became like kind of right"
05:59;06:06;"wing, it does seem like there used to be some kind of like broader anti-cop consensus."
06:06;06:12;"Maybe it's happening again, but there used to be like that kind of like not necessarily"
06:12;06:18;"like sweet natured, social justice oriented person, but almost that like libertarian rock"
06:18;06:20;"and roller just like man, f*** the cops."
06:20;06:21;"You know what I mean?"
06:21;06:24;"Because like when you think about the Grateful Dead, and I'm definitely we're not going to"
06:24;06:28;"talk about this too long because I don't want people to think that we're using this current"
06:28;06:31;"terrible moment as a reason to talk about the dead more."
06:31;06:33;"But you know, they represent a generational thing, right?"
06:33;06:38;"And when you think about how many times there were these like negative interactions between"
06:38;06:43;"like kids at Grateful Dead shows and cops, because there was this feeling of kind of"
06:43;06:45;"like authority is messed up."
06:45;06:49;"A certain type of authority, especially when it's weaponized, is messed up."
06:49;06:54;"And even if you're not like super tuned in with social justice movements, I feel like"
06:54;06:59;"there used to be a tiny bit more consensus, or maybe there always is a consensus with"
06:59;07:00;"young people."
07:00;07:05;"And then as white people get older, they tend to veer right and that's the problem."
07:05;07:11;"But I feel like there used to be some consensus where a lot of people understood that there's"
07:11;07:15;"a problem with police brutality."
07:15;07:19;"And maybe that's the issue is that it always goes, people got really short memories."
07:19;07:22;"Yeah, I mean, it's not affecting you or your community."
07:22;07:24;"It's kind of like, well, they did what they had to do."
07:24;07:29;"Yeah, I mean, I guess that's, you know, maybe where the hippies and the punks used to dovetail."
07:29;07:30;"Right."
07:30;07:31;"But that was a long time ago."
07:31;07:35;"And now, you know, there aren't many hippies or punks anymore."
07:35;07:36;"Right."
07:36;07:40;"And then for several years after 9/11, there was the sort of like, deference paid to law"
07:40;07:42;"enforcement."
07:42;07:46;"And yeah, it was just we're in a different era than the hippies and the punks."
07:46;07:51;"That's a sad part of human nature a little bit is like, I can totally picture this person."
07:51;07:55;"They were either a hippie in the 60s or a punk in the 70s or 80s."
07:55;07:58;"They were maybe a middle class white kid."
07:58;08:00;"They just wanted to have fun and be with their friends."
08:00;08:02;"And they would have a very negative interaction with a cop."
08:02;08:08;"And they would see the way in which when somebody has a weapon and is charged with enforcing"
08:08;08:13;"control, that that can create really negative situations for people."
08:13;08:14;"And they got it."
08:14;08:19;"And then it's like the early 90s, maybe like a small business owner has a mortgage or something"
08:19;08:24;"starting to feel a little more like protective of like law and order and property."
08:24;08:29;"And then like iced tea with body count cop killer comes out and is just like, this is"
08:29;08:31;"a bridge too far."
08:31;08:33;"This is just wanton violence, anger."
08:33;08:35;"It's kind of that's classic."
08:35;08:42;"Fragile coalition falls apart."
08:43;08:47;"The sun is getting higher."
08:47;08:53;"I can't help you if you're a problem."
08:53;08:59;"If you won't help me with mine."
08:59;09:03;"Gotta get down."
09:03;09:05;"Gotta get down."
09:05;09:11;"To the mine."
09:12;09:14;"Oh, my."
09:14;09:19;"You know, I did see an All Lives Matter sign during my march."
09:19;09:24;"Huge crowd, you know, going through the street and walking past one of those like new, like"
09:24;09:27;"kind of like 12 story new condos downtown."
09:27;09:28;"Yeah."
09:28;09:33;"There were some people out on the balcony, like the glass balcony with an All Lives Matter"
09:33;09:35;"sign taped to their balcony."
09:35;09:40;"And then also a sign that said businesses did not kill George Floyd."
09:40;09:44;"And they were standing out in the balcony, kind of like holding drinks, sort of like"
09:44;09:47;"12 stories up, kind of looking down at the crowd being like, what?"
09:47;09:48;"What?"
09:48;09:53;"I don't necessarily agree with it, but of course, there's a case to be made that aspects"
09:53;09:56;"of looting are counterproductive."
09:56;10:01;"I don't personally feel like making that point, especially because what we've seen so far"
10:01;10:07;"hasn't been like truly out of control in the sense that it's like, you know, when you look"
10:07;10:11;"at riots of the past where blocks get burned down and you're just like, that's going to"
10:11;10:14;"take a generation to like recover for this community."
10:14;10:19;"And of course, there's still so much like speculation about with huge groups of people."
10:19;10:23;"You can literally have five people, whatever their political agenda is."
10:23;10:26;"All it would take is five people to make a peaceful protest seem violent."
10:26;10:29;"You know, five people with bricks or a shovel."
10:29;10:30;"It doesn't take much."
10:30;10:33;"One person could start it."
10:33;10:37;"I was thinking that when we're on our march, because the march was totally peaceful."
10:37;10:38;"Vibes were good."
10:38;10:40;"Cops and National Guard were keeping their distance."
10:40;10:45;"But I was like, man, it would just take one person, even throwing like a water bottle."
10:45;10:52;"And so no wonder that the concept of the agent provocateur has existed for a long time, because"
10:52;10:56;"it's really so easy for somebody to embed themselves in something and change the tone"
10:56;10:57;"of it very quickly."
10:57;10:59;"And I'm sure everybody's seen there's videos."
10:59;11:05;"One of them looked like L.A. and there's a black woman is on camera and she's yelling"
11:05;11:07;"at these two younger women."
11:07;11:08;"I don't know."
11:08;11:09;"They could be white, Hispanic."
11:09;11:10;"They're not black."
11:10;11:14;"And they're masked up and they're spray painting BLM on a Starbucks."
11:14;11:18;"And a black woman is yelling at them saying, what are you doing?"
11:18;11:19;"Who asked you to do this?"
11:19;11:23;"We're the ones that are going to get in trouble for this, not you."
11:23;11:25;"And then these two people kind of sheepishly walk off."
11:25;11:28;"Are they undercover cops doing it?"
11:28;11:31;"Are they paid or are they just people who just wanted to get in the mix and thought"
11:31;11:32;"it was a good idea?"
11:32;11:35;"And then this woman thought it was a terrible idea."
11:35;11:40;"But of course, what the woman said is right, that this image of a Starbucks tagged up with"
11:40;11:47;"BLM will be sent out to people all over the country as an example of why the BLM movement"
11:47;11:50;"has no respect for property or something."
11:50;11:55;"Yeah, it was interesting to like when it really started to explode in Minneapolis."
11:55;11:58;"How many of the photographs were of like chain stores?"
11:58;11:59;"Yeah."
11:59;12:04;"Famously, the photo of like the AutoZone getting thrashed and that there was like a dollar"
12:04;12:05;"tree."
12:05;12:06;"And of course, the target."
12:06;12:07;"Yes."
12:07;12:08;"But I actually looked it up."
12:08;12:12;"I was like, oh, man, because like I have to say, like, it is a bummer when you see like"
12:12;12:15;"photos of like some small family restaurant burning down."
12:15;12:17;"This is sort of like, oh, man."
12:17;12:18;"Yeah."
12:18;12:21;"I don't feel that same sense of sympathy like with an AutoZone."
12:21;12:26;"And then I was like, well, maybe there's an individual franchisee that owns an AutoZone."
12:26;12:32;"But then I actually did a little bit of number crunching and determined AutoZone and Dollar"
12:32;12:35;"Tree do not offer franchise opportunities."
12:35;12:38;"So they're just really corporate owned stores."
12:38;12:40;"I'm sure very well insured."
12:40;12:46;"I mean, it's hard to have too much sympathy for like smashed windows at a big box store,"
12:46;12:50;"especially because in this country we've seen, you know, the L.A. riots."
12:50;12:58;"This is an example of a true like conflagration that was so far more dangerous, more brutal,"
12:58;13:00;"involved like torching stuff in a community."
13:00;13:02;"You know, you've seen those images."
13:02;13:04;"Anybody's watched like a documentary about it."
13:04;13:08;"I recommend the L.A. 92, which is on Netflix, is like a really gripping one."
13:08;13:09;"No narration."
13:09;13:10;"You're kind of."
13:10;13:11;"Have you seen that one, Jake?"
13:11;13:12;"Yes, I have."
13:12;13:13;"Crazy."
13:13;13:14;"Yeah."
13:14;13:17;"So there's something about that that's I think really worth revisiting for people right now"
13:17;13:21;"is that a I don't know how it'll make somebody feel for me."
13:21;13:22;"I see it."
13:22;13:27;"And I in some ways, it reminds me that so far what's happening now, I certainly haven't"
13:27;13:32;"seen anything that seems quite as like intense as that."
13:32;13:34;"It doesn't mean there's not intensity of feeling."
13:34;13:38;"But, you know, this is to put it all in perspective that a these times we're living in are not"
13:38;13:40;"exactly unprecedented."
13:40;13:41;"Covid and Trump."
13:41;13:42;"Yeah."
13:42;13:44;"Give a different patina to the moment."
13:44;13:49;"But in a larger sense, it's not truly an unprecedented time and could either make you feel a little"
13:49;13:54;"calmer or or just more depressed that it is such a cyclical thing."
13:54;13:55;"Yeah."
13:55;14:01;"In some ways, it almost seems like these protests and even the looting seems so much more targeted."
14:01;14:03;"It doesn't seem chaotic and out of control."
14:03;14:04;"Right."
14:04;14:05;"Seems like a strategic like."
14:05;14:06;"Yeah, because I agree."
14:06;14:11;"Seeing like a mom and pop store charred somebody's livelihood up in smoke."
14:11;14:16;"That is a thorny moral issue where you're like, even if they're sympathetic to the protesters,"
14:16;14:18;"how's that person supposed to feel?"
14:18;14:20;"That's tricky, but we haven't seen a lot of that."
14:20;14:23;"So, yeah, that makes it all feel a little more under control."
14:24;14:33;"When I'm weary and so worn out."
14:33;14:45;"And my mind's clouded and filled with doubt."
14:45;14:58;"That's when I feel the most alive."
14:58;15:11;"My sarcastic kisses are how I thrive."
15:11;15:16;"So anyway, like we said, anybody listens to Time Crisis knows people like me and Jake"
15:16;15:22;"or don't find these situations to be particularly ambiguous."
15:22;15:26;"And I really do think a lot of people, it seems, and it's heartening to know how many"
15:26;15:30;"people are talking about issues of police brutality at this moment."
15:30;15:35;"I really do think that a majority of Americans see these images and these videos and are"
15:35;15:36;"disturbed by it."
15:36;15:43;"And we could go into the details on what specifically happened to somebody like George Floyd or"
15:43;15:44;"Breonna Taylor."
15:44;15:47;"And I do think people need to acquaint themselves with the details."
15:47;15:52;"But it always leads to this place where the next question is like, so what's supposed"
15:52;15:53;"to change?"
15:53;15:57;"And that's the thing that I just keep coming back to and wanting to read about, because"
15:57;16:00;"I agree people need to protest."
16:00;16:02;"People need to vote."
16:02;16:04;"All these things are important."
16:04;16:06;"I don't want to minimize them."
16:06;16:10;"But I guess this happens to a lot of people as you get older and you've been to protests."
16:10;16:15;"For me, one of the defining protests of my life was the a million people in the streets"
16:15;16:19;"of Manhattan against the war in Iraq, which unfortunately did nothing."
16:19;16:24;"It doesn't mean that I look down on those protests and I admire people who organize"
16:24;16:25;"protests and get out there."
16:25;16:26;"But I was down there."
16:26;16:30;"I was probably my first big protest as an adult."
16:30;16:35;"And there is that feeling where you're like, you see all this anger, you know, so many"
16:35;16:37;"people who feel that way."
16:37;16:42;"But there is this big question, like, do we just like live in like some weird matrix where"
16:42;16:45;"just like nobody's in control?"
16:45;16:48;"Obviously, we're aware of the racial and economic disparities in this country."
16:48;16:51;"So we know that certain groups of people are in control."
16:51;16:56;"But we also know that the Democrats have effective control of a lot of big cities where there's"
16:56;16:57;"plenty of police brutality."
16:57;17:00;"Minneapolis, for instance, I'm not a huge fan of the Democrats."
17:00;17:03;"I always vote for them over Republicans."
17:03;17:05;"But, you know, I think they need a lot of reforms themselves."
17:05;17:11;"But you see in a state where there's a liberal mayor, a Democratic governor, not a single"
17:11;17:13;"Republican on the city council."
17:13;17:17;"It is one of those things where you're like, well, if even the opposition party can't even"
17:17;17:25;"govern a city in a way that truly changes the relationship of police to poor people"
17:25;17:29;"and black people, you really have to fight to not become nihilistic."
17:29;17:30;"You know what I mean?"
17:30;17:31;"Oh, I mean, totally."
17:31;17:35;"And that's, you know, partially why I wanted to have Alex S. Vitale on."
17:35;17:37;"And we're about to get him on the phone."
17:37;17:39;"So he wrote this book, The End of Policing."
17:39;17:41;"He's a professor at Brooklyn College."
17:41;17:48;"And this book, by the way, Verso Books, well-known kind of lefty academic publisher, actually"
17:48;17:51;"put up the e-book of this for free."
17:51;17:56;"If you go to the Verso Books website, you could buy a hard copy, but you could also"
17:56;17:59;"get the e-book for free if you go to that option."
17:59;18:03;"So, you know, there's this Atlantic article he wrote floating around where he kind of"
18:03;18:09;"laid out why so many of these reforms that people are begging for, that liberals are"
18:09;18:11;"begging for, don't work."
18:11;18:14;"And so it really struck a chord with me as somebody who's, you know, I'm reaching that"
18:14;18:19;"place in life where you have to fight to not be nihilistic because you've seen protests"
18:19;18:25;"fail, and you've seen well-meaning people still somehow like put people in office who"
18:25;18:26;"don't do anything."
18:26;18:29;"And you just start to like legitimately get confused."
18:29;18:33;"I understand that, you know, half the country are Republicans."
18:33;18:35;"You know, we don't share the same values."
18:35;18:40;"What I don't understand is why the half that supposedly shares the same values is so ineffective."
18:40;18:43;"You know, you start to ask those questions, and it's not easy."
18:43;18:46;"So anyway, in his book, he kind of gets into the history of policing."
18:46;18:50;"That was interesting because it made me think, you know, on Time Crisis, we always love to"
18:50;18:53;"go deep on stuff, get into the origins."
18:53;18:59;"Like, Jake, you've always been very fascinated and knowledgeable about the origins of chain"
18:59;19:01;"restaurants, like, you know, paint the picture."
19:01;19:02;"Where was this started?"
19:02;19:04;"What did the retail landscape look like before it existed?"
19:04;19:07;"Those are all like really valuable questions to ask."
19:07;19:11;"And reading his book, I kind of realized like I don't even know the version of that when"
19:11;19:12;"it comes to cops."
19:12;19:13;"It's something that we just like assume."
19:13;19:15;"Of course, there's always been police, right?"
19:15;19:20;"And the way he kind of tells the story of how the modern police force was developed"
19:20;19:25;"makes you realize that what we have now is not just something that always exists."
19:25;19:28;"You know, you could make the case that people want to live in a society where there's some"
19:28;19:33;"sort of like safety officers or arbitrators or third parties you can go to to deal with"
19:33;19:36;"disputes between people like to live in a safe world."
19:36;19:37;"Of course."
19:37;19:41;"But what we have is a very specific thing, just like you're always going to have restaurants."
19:41;19:45;"But how did we end up with like 500 red lobsters?"
19:45;19:47;"You know, like people need to eat."
19:47;19:53;"But the American retail dining landscape ended up this way for a variety of reasons, you"
19:53;19:56;"know, and I think those are questions that we don't ask enough about policing."
19:56;20:00;"And in some ways, we're always kind of just like trying to deal with the outcome where"
20:00;20:04;"it's like, right, how do we punish that cop versus like these bigger questions?"
20:04;20:09;"So anyway, let's get Alex on the phone because he's somebody who clearly has thought about"
20:09;20:12;"this deeply, researched and wrote about it."
20:12;20:14;"And I got a lot of questions for him."
20:14;20:18;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
20:18;20:22;"Hello."
20:22;20:23;"Hey, Alex."
20:23;20:24;"Yeah."
20:24;20:25;"Hey, welcome to Time Crisis."
20:25;20:26;"Jan with Ezra and Jake."
20:26;20:28;"Hey, how's it going, guys?"
20:28;20:29;"Not bad."
20:29;20:31;"We really appreciate having you on the show."
20:31;20:34;"I just burned through your book the past few days."
20:34;20:39;"It's very cool that Verso Books put the e-book up for free and we're recommending it to our"
20:39;20:42;"listeners and got a lot of questions about the end of policing."
20:42;20:46;"I'm looking through the highlights that I made on my Kindle."
20:46;20:50;"The first one is just the phrase ""right wing martial arts expert Chuck Norris""."
20:50;20:56;"I think I might have just found that to be funny and a great description."
20:56;21:00;"Maybe your next book should be about the rise of right wing martial arts experts in America."
21:00;21:01;"Yeah."
21:01;21:02;"There are quite a few of them."
21:02;21:03;"Too many."
21:03;21:04;"Let's start with the first."
21:04;21:06;"One thing I found really interesting that I didn't expect in your book is that at the"
21:06;21:11;"beginning, before you get into examining and diagnosing a lot of the problems of modern"
21:11;21:18;"policing, you kind of give the readers a little origin story of modern policing."
21:18;21:21;"In a naive way, I realized it's the kind of thing I never thought about."
21:21;21:25;"I think a lot of people, we just assume there have always been cops."
21:25;21:29;"There's always been authority for thousands of years."
21:29;21:34;"But you kind of get into the origins of the specific type of policing that we have now"
21:34;21:36;"because it didn't always exist."
21:36;21:42;"Most kind of liberal scholars of policing, they talk about the London Metropolitan Police"
21:42;21:45;"formed in 1829 as kind of the beginning of policing."
21:45;21:50;"I argue that really the first modern police force is the Charleston City Watch and Guard,"
21:50;21:52;"which is formed in the 1790s."
21:52;21:58;"The reason liberals don't talk about it is because its primary law enforcement objective"
21:58;22:04;"was to manage a mobile slave population that worked outside the home of its owners."
22:04;22:10;"So it's a complicated and not very pretty history, and I'm happy to go into any details"
22:10;22:12;"you want to talk about."
22:12;22:13;"Well, that's interesting right there."
22:13;22:17;"So you're talking about the Charleston, South Carolina Police Force, because that's the"
22:17;22:24;"type of thing that I think a liberal person might see on social media where somebody says,"
22:24;22:29;"""Don't you understand that the modern police force is rooted in just controlling slaves?"""
22:29;22:34;"And I think a lot of people might say, ""Well, I mean, not literally."
22:34;22:41;"I understand the metaphor of groups of majority white people controlling and oppressing black people,"
22:41;22:42;"but not literally."""
22:42;22:44;"I feel like that's how a lot of people feel."
22:44;22:49;"But you're saying, at least in modern American history, there's a literal connection between"
22:49;22:54;"controlling and catching slaves and modern policing."
22:54;22:55;"That's right."
22:55;23:01;"In the South, it took this very overt form, and in the North, it took a more indirect form."
23:01;23:07;"Initially, it took the form of slave catching, which was one of the functions of early police"
23:07;23:11;"was to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act."
23:11;23:17;"And this became a major function, and sometimes this involved getting rewards and things like that."
23:17;23:23;"But we also don't want to reduce this to just a conversation about slavery, because this"
23:23;23:30;"is also a conversation about the suppression of workers' movements in the rise of industrialization."
23:30;23:33;"And it's also a story about colonialism."
23:33;23:38;"Another really early police force in the United States was the Texas Rangers, which still"
23:38;23:40;"exists today."
23:40;23:47;"But their primary job was to drive out the indigenous population and then Mexican and"
23:47;23:51;"Spanish landowners to make way for white settlement."
23:51;23:57;"And also, you know, the precursor of the London Metropolitan Police, which was created by"
23:57;24:01;"Sir Robert Peel, Robert, Bob, the Bobbies."
24:01;24:04;"No one ever talks about, well, where did he get this idea from?"
24:04;24:06;"Like, it just fell out of the sky."
24:06;24:12;"But his prior job was that he was in charge of the English occupation of Ireland, a colonial"
24:12;24:13;"occupation."
24:13;24:20;"And he develops the Irish Peace Preservation Force as this kind of hybrid precursor to"
24:20;24:21;"policing."
24:21;24:27;"And their primary job was to put down so-called agricultural outrages, which were really peasant"
24:27;24:29;"uprisings against English landlords."
25:08;25:25;"I guess one question, just to like really understand what the difference is."
25:25;25:31;"So in Ireland, for instance, this guy Robert Peel, who then goes on to form the first modern"
25:31;25:35;"police force in London, he creates a new type of policing."
25:35;25:40;"So before that, there weren't cops, so to speak, there was the military."
25:40;25:46;"In the colonial context, they relied on the military and some militias."
25:46;25:53;"And one of the reasons that Peel had to invent this new thing was at that period, the British"
25:53;26:00;"military was fighting Napoleon, and he couldn't get enough troops to control the Irish countryside."
26:00;26:05;"Also, when you use military troops to control that kind of stuff, a lot of people tend to"
26:05;26:11;"get shot and killed, which creates a kind of crisis of legitimacy for the occupation."
26:11;26:13;"It just stirs up more resistance."
26:13;26:18;"And so the Irish Peace Preservation Force was embedded in local communities and had"
26:18;26:21;"this kind of law enforcement patina to it."
26:21;26:29;"That way, they were able to identify incipient uprisings more quickly and intervene preemptively"
26:29;26:31;"and less violently."
26:31;26:37;"And this allowed the colonial regime to function ultimately much more efficiently."
26:37;26:42;"And of course, that's what he was trying to transfer to London is how do we deal with"
26:42;26:50;"this massive influx of workers from the countryside who've been displaced by agricultural changes?"
26:50;26:57;"So the modern policing was in some ways a way to create an alternative to like military intervention?"
26:57;27:02;"Exactly, or the militia, which is essentially like our National Guard today in many ways."
27:02;27:12;"In New York, there was a long history of rioting in which the militia just opened fire on large"
27:12;27:15;"crowds until the invention of policing."
27:15;27:20;"There's a long history of the doctors' riots and the theater riots and the this and that"
27:20;27:21;"riots."
27:21;27:25;"And the way those riots were controlled is that the militia would be called out."
27:25;27:28;"They would line up, order people to disperse."
27:28;27:31;"And if they didn't disperse, they opened fire on the crowd."
27:31;27:35;"In some ways, when you put it that way, it seems like a positive development, right?"
27:35;27:36;"Right."
27:36;27:39;"And it almost seems like it's coming full circle with the militarization of the police"
27:39;27:40;"force again."
27:40;27:46;"So you kind of feel like modern policing never was able to move past its origin story."
27:46;27:52;"Because, yeah, like the way you put it, the idea of embedded local people who are not"
27:52;27:57;"just opening fire on crowds seems like pointing in the right direction."
27:57;28:02;"But to you and in your research, because it was always crafted as a means of controlling"
28:02;28:08;"people, stopping labor movements, controlling slaves, its mission never kind of changed"
28:08;28:09;"in a sense?"
28:09;28:16;"It's managed to kind of manufacture a certain level of order in society in a less violent"
28:16;28:18;"way than the militia."
28:18;28:21;"But the militia was not called out very often."
28:21;28:24;"And people had a lot more social freedom."
28:24;28:29;"And yes, life was a little bit more disorderly, but there were a lot of benefits that went"
28:29;28:30;"with that."
28:30;28:36;"At the same time, the order that's been crafted by this new institution does not benefit everyone"
28:36;28:37;"equally."
28:37;28:43;"And it hasn't really benefited African-Americans in a whole variety of ways over the last 150"
28:43;28:44;"years, right?"
28:44;28:52;"So it allows these regimes of economic exploitation to continue to function."
28:52;29:00;"So yes, it's less overtly violent in its extremes, but there's also this constant everyday violence"
29:00;29:06;"that usually doesn't result in death, but can be demeaning and degrading nonetheless."
29:06;29:11;"Obviously, the average person who's getting on social media that reflects their opinion"
29:11;29:14;"is not an academic with the breadth of knowledge that you have."
29:14;29:20;"But one very common thing you see, I've seen it in the comment section on my own Instagram,"
29:20;29:25;"anytime somebody criticizes the police force or the actions of the police, a very common"
29:25;29:31;"refrain from kind of pro-cop type people is, ""You don't want somebody to go to if you got"
29:31;29:32;"robbed?"
29:32;29:37;"Like, do you really think that the world can function without any type of authority?"""
29:37;29:42;"What's your response when you encounter that kind of just like really simple, like, ""Oh,"
29:42;29:43;"what?"
29:43;29:46;"So you don't want somebody to go to if you get robbed or hurt?"""
29:46;29:47;"Delete?"
29:47;29:49;"No, that's not my response."
29:49;29:54;"So there's a few things to unpack here."
29:54;30:02;"One is that, you know, often these are comments driven by a kind of thin blue line mentality"
30:02;30:10;"that just accepts this idea that the only possible solution to a problem is a punitive"
30:10;30:12;"and coercive solution."
30:12;30:17;"And so they have a very pessimistic understanding about the world."
30:17;30:23;"They assume that everyone would be a robber and a rapist and a murderer, except of course"
30:23;30:24;"them."
30:24;30:27;"So this is a misunderstanding about human nature."
30:27;30:31;"You know, if we look at wealthy communities, they don't have a lot of policing and they"
30:31;30:35;"manage to figure things out fairly well without that."
30:35;30:40;"But it's certainly true that there are a lot of communities that have very serious public"
30:40;30:42;"safety challenges."
30:42;30:48;"What I'm proposing is not any kind of situation where tomorrow you flip some magic switch"
30:48;30:50;"and there are no police."
30:50;30:54;"What I'm talking about is a process that's embedded in a set of principles."
30:54;31:02;"And the process is that we look to try to reduce our reliance on coercive and punitive"
31:02;31:05;"interventions as much as we possibly can."
31:05;31:11;"That when we look at community problems, we try to find solutions that are effective,"
31:11;31:16;"that are done in a cost effective way, and that treat people with as much human dignity"
31:16;31:18;"as possible."
31:18;31:21;"And policing kind of fails on all these measures."
31:21;31:25;"I love that way that you put it, and that was the feeling I got reading your book too,"
31:25;31:32;"is that when you talk about that kind of gotcha point that sometimes people make where they're"
31:32;31:35;"like, ""Oh what, so there's magically not going to be problems?"""
31:35;31:39;"You're not saying there will no longer be problems that need to be addressed."
31:39;31:42;"And like you put it, there sometimes are major problems that need to be addressed when people"
31:42;31:45;"live together, problems of safety and harm."
31:45;31:51;"The question, and this is where the origins of all this stuff become very important, is"
31:51;31:53;"that there are many ways to solve problems."
31:53;31:57;"And like you said, coercive and punitive measures are very ineffective."
31:57;32:01;"And there's an interesting part of your book too, where you quote a police officer who's"
32:01;32:07;"kind of complaining about how many things fall under the purview of the police force."
32:07;32:09;"And it's interesting to think about."
32:09;32:12;"This is the type of, I mean you've been researching this for a long time, so maybe for you it's"
32:12;32:18;"kind of basic, but it's an interesting perspective shift to realize that we take it as forgiven."
32:18;32:20;"Cops enforce the law, right?"
32:20;32:22;"And they do it in a coercive and punitive way."
32:22;32:27;"They drag people to jail, they can use violence if they feel they need to."
32:27;32:31;"But it was interesting to think, not all laws are enforced by police officers, right?"
32:31;32:37;"The people who go check out the kitchen at a Chipotle and decide if that Chipotle gets"
32:37;32:38;"an A or a B, right?"
32:38;32:40;"Those are not police officers."
32:40;32:42;"It's a different group of people."
32:42;32:47;"And it's kind of like a very naive insight, but it's hard sometimes to step back and realize"
32:47;32:52;"that not everything that the police take care of, they in particular need to take care of."
32:52;32:57;"And one interesting point in your book is that you talk about the fact that right now,"
32:57;33:02;"the war on drugs is the most damaging and ineffective form of policing facing us."
33:02;33:07;"And the fact that dealing with drugs and drug offenses is under the purview of the police"
33:07;33:10;"creates so many situations that lead to violence."
33:10;33:13;"Jails ruin so many lives, ruins communities."
33:13;33:17;"And one point that you make is that some people probably wonder,"
33:17;33:19;"""Well, what would happen if drugs were legal?"
33:19;33:20;"Wouldn't that lead to craziness?"""
33:20;33:23;"But as you point out in your book, there are two things that are more or less legal"
33:23;33:27;"everywhere now that used to not be, and that's alcohol and gambling."
33:27;33:31;"So actually in the history of this country, we have some pretty good insight into what"
33:31;33:36;"it looks like when the police are in charge of criminalizing one thing and what it looks"
33:36;33:38;"like when they're no longer in charge of that."
33:38;33:42;"So can you talk about those examples and how that might be, can help us with our"
33:42;33:45;"modern thinking about what police need to be in charge of?"
33:45;33:49;"Yeah, well, let's think about the case of Eric Garner for a second, right?"
33:49;33:52;"Who was killed by police in New York."
33:52;33:58;"The offense that he was alleged to have been engaged in was that he was selling untaxed cigarettes."
33:58;34:01;"But why is that a matter for the police?"
34:01;34:03;"It's a tax problem."
34:03;34:06;"I mean, you could even ask the question, why is that illegal in the first place?"
34:06;34:08;"Well, there's that, right?"
34:08;34:14;"We could ask questions about the decisions about what gets taxed, what gets made illegal,"
34:14;34:16;"what gets highly regulated."
34:16;34:23;"And ideally, that should be based on some kind of robust consideration about relative"
34:23;34:28;"harms and the most effective strategies for reducing those harms."
34:28;34:34;"So that offense should never have been addressed by police in the first place."
34:34;34:37;"And Eric Garner would still be alive."
34:37;34:44;"And the laws that we are asking the police to enforce are not handed down by God, despite"
34:44;34:46;"what some people might think."
34:46;34:48;"They're political decisions."
34:48;34:54;"So the decision to make drugs illegal but alcohol legal is based on a lot of really"
34:54;34:56;"problematic calculations, right?"
34:56;35:02;"Nixon ramps up the drug war for political purposes, not for public safety or public"
35:02;35:03;"health purposes."
35:03;35:09;"So when we, for instance, undertake reforms to policing that are intended to just make"
35:09;35:17;"the police more efficient, effective, professional enforcers of the law, but we don't actually"
35:17;35:22;"interrogate the laws they're being asked to enforce, we just open ourselves up to more"
35:22;35:23;"abuse."
35:23;35:27;"And I sometimes say, you know, if you're concerned about the racial disparities in"
35:27;35:32;"drug arrests, the solution to that is not to give narcotics units anti-bias training."
35:32;35:34;"It's to get rid of the war on drugs."
35:34;35:36;"And Portugal has done this, right?"
35:36;35:39;"In Portugal, all drugs have been decriminalized."
35:39;35:43;"They just took police out of it and turned it over to the public health system."
35:43;35:44;"So can you explain that a little bit?"
35:44;35:49;"Because this is a great example of in Portugal, they're not saying no problems ever arise"
35:49;35:51;"from drugs, so we're not even going to worry about it."
35:51;35:57;"Rather, they chose to not have it be addressed by police officers, because obviously, if"
35:57;36:01;"drugs are decriminalized in Portugal, you're still going to have problems with addiction."
36:01;36:02;"People could still die from drugs."
36:02;36:07;"But so how is that dealt with rather than having the police deal with it?"
36:07;36:13;"In Portugal, they basically have adopted a public health harm reduction strategy."
36:13;36:20;"Portugal had a terrible intravenous drug injection drug use problem, and it was producing high"
36:20;36:24;"levels of HIV transmission and overdoses."
36:24;36:28;"And they tried using policing to crack down on this."
36:28;36:34;"And all it did was drive it into even deeper crevices, more underground black markets where"
36:34;36:39;"people did not know what they were getting, where they couldn't get medical help."
36:39;36:41;"People were ending up in prison."
36:41;36:43;"And they said, this is not working."
36:43;36:50;"What if instead we acknowledge the fact that there's no way to prevent people from getting"
36:50;36:51;"drugs, right?"
36:51;36:55;"We've had in the US, we've had a war on drugs for 40 years, and anybody can get any kind"
36:55;36:56;"of drugs they want."
36:56;37:02;"Instead, what if we tried to identify what the most important harms are that come from"
37:02;37:10;"people's problematic relationships with drugs and try to actually reduce those harms through"
37:10;37:17;"things like safe injection facilities, needle exchanges, access to high quality treatment"
37:17;37:22;"programs on demand, none of which are available in the United States."
37:22;37:27;"And as a result, HIV infection rates have gone down, the most in Europe."
37:27;37:29;"Overdoses are down."
37:29;37:33;"And civilization in Portugal has not collapsed."
37:33;37:36;"Right. It sounds like it's in many ways much better."
37:36;37:37;"They're very happy with it."
38:23;38:27;"- So right now, I think a lot of what we see on social media,"
38:27;38:28;"depending on who you follow,"
38:28;38:30;"you might see all sorts of stuff."
38:30;38:33;"You might see some real far lefty anarchist type saying,"
38:33;38:35;"""Literally abolish the police."""
38:35;38:38;"And you might see the phrase, ""Defund the police."""
38:38;38:39;"And then you also see,"
38:39;38:42;"there's a campaign now called Eight Can't Wait."
38:42;38:44;"That's a series of eight reforms"
38:44;38:47;"involving things like banning choke holds"
38:47;38:49;"and always warning before you fire."
38:49;38:51;"These are three things that I've noticed"
38:51;38:53;"kind of trending on social media."
38:53;38:54;"And do you have opinions on these?"
38:54;38:55;"Have you been monitoring this?"
38:55;38:57;"- Yeah, of course, of course."
38:57;38:58;"- Yeah, which one fits your view"
38:58;39:00;"and your understanding of the problem?"
39:00;39:02;"- So Eight Can't Wait, you know,"
39:02;39:07;"is coming from DeRay and Sam Singenway and Campaign Zero."
39:07;39:11;"And these guys have been trying to identify"
39:11;39:16;"specific targeted interventions in policing"
39:16;39:19;"that have some evidence to support them"
39:19;39:22;"that might reduce the harms of policing."
39:22;39:27;"But DeRay came out with a big article where he said,"
39:27;39:30;"""Plus, we gotta defund the police."""
39:30;39:31;"- For DeRay, it's not an either or."
39:31;39:32;"These things go in tandem."
39:32;39:35;"- It's not an either or, it's not an either or."
39:35;39:38;"My view is that the Eight Can't Wait stuff"
39:38;39:40;"at least has some evidence behind it"
39:40;39:43;"in a way that a lot of the stuff in the Obama report didn't."
39:43;39:45;"Like implicit bias training,"
39:45;39:47;"there's just no evidence that works."
39:47;39:50;"It's just providing political cover"
39:50;39:52;"for politicians and police chiefs"
39:52;39:54;"to say they're doing something about racism."
39:54;39:57;"I'm not so optimistic that these eight things"
39:57;40:00;"are really gonna do the trick."
40:00;40:05;"And also, the political leverage to get them implemented"
40:05;40:10;"is going to require a massive campaign to defund the police."
40:10;40:14;"And ultimately, ultimately, the defund the police thing"
40:14;40:17;"I think points us in the right direction anyway,"
40:17;40:20;"which is that we've just got to quit turning"
40:20;40:22;"every social problem under the sun"
40:22;40:25;"over to the police to manage."
40:25;40:29;"Because a totally lawful, nonviolent,"
40:29;40:32;"procedurally proper drug arrest"
40:32;40:34;"is still gonna ruin someone's life"
40:34;40:37;"for no damn good reason."
40:37;40:39;"There's no justice in that."
40:39;40:42;"So the defund movement has more clarity about that."
40:42;40:45;"It's not just about zeroing out the police budget, right?"
40:45;40:48;"It's about chipping away at the police budget"
40:48;40:53;"and shifting those resources to community-identified needs."
40:53;40:55;"And there are a lot of campaigns around the country"
40:55;40:57;"that have been calling for this."
40:57;41:00;"They've got specific dollar targets."
41:00;41:03;"They're testifying at city council budget hearings."
41:03;41:06;"They've identified the community interventions"
41:06;41:08;"that they want the money transferred to."
41:08;41:11;"And I think this is incredibly important."
41:11;41:14;"Is this different than abolish the police?"
41:14;41:16;"Well, there are different strains"
41:16;41:19;"in the whole abolish the police world."
41:19;41:21;"For most people who are involved"
41:21;41:24;"in actual organizing around this issue,"
41:24;41:28;"they support these defund the police movements."
41:28;41:31;"And they're also engaged in trying to figure out"
41:31;41:35;"how do we get to some kind of a world"
41:35;41:39;"where policing in prisons don't have to be in our lives."
41:39;41:42;"But they understand that that's not gonna happen tomorrow."
41:42;41:44;"That's something we're building towards."
41:44;41:46;"It's a vision that guides our work."
41:46;41:49;"And frankly, I put myself in that camp."
41:49;41:52;"I don't know what that other world is gonna be,"
41:52;41:55;"but I know it's not gonna be filled with police"
41:55;41:57;"and that to the extent that we can get police"
41:57;42:01;"out of our lives and build up communities,"
42:01;42:04;"that's part of that process of building a better world."
42:04;42:05;"- That makes a lot of sense to me."
42:05;42:08;"And I always, people talk so much about good cops"
42:08;42:11;"versus bad cops in moments like this."
42:11;42:14;"And you see some people say all cops are bad"
42:14;42:16;"because they're tasked with enforcing these unjust laws."
42:16;42:17;"And some people say, well, hold on,"
42:17;42:20;"the classic bad apple thing we've heard a million times."
42:20;42:21;"Some cops are good."
42:21;42:23;"And I can't help but think that this concept"
42:23;42:28;"of defunding the police would ultimately create other jobs"
42:28;42:30;"for civic-minded people."
42:30;42:32;"I'm totally willing to believe that there are many people"
42:32;42:35;"who join the police force because they think"
42:35;42:37;"it's the best way that they can help"
42:37;42:39;"keep a community safe, right?"
42:39;42:40;"- Absolutely."
42:40;42:43;"- And so I'm not gonna pretend that every single person"
42:43;42:44;"who joins the police force only does it"
42:44;42:46;"to bash somebody's head in."
42:46;42:48;"In that sense, I believe that there are people"
42:48;42:50;"who go into the force with very good intentions"
42:50;42:53;"and probably do their best once they're there."
42:53;42:56;"But the idea that they are then tasked"
42:56;42:57;"with covering all these different things,"
42:57;42:59;"everything from dealing with somebody passing"
42:59;43:04;"a counterfeit bill, perhaps, to busting people for drugs."
43:04;43:05;"I guess one way to think about it too,"
43:05;43:06;"'cause I think sometimes people hear this phrase,"
43:06;43:09;"defund the police, and they think, like you said,"
43:09;43:11;"they might have this vision, what, down to zero?"
43:11;43:14;"But what you're talking about is that every city,"
43:14;43:15;"every government has a budget, right?"
43:15;43:18;"If it's a big pie that's going to the police,"
43:18;43:20;"and part of it is so that the police can deal"
43:20;43:23;"with something like counterfeit bills or drugs,"
43:23;43:24;"partially what you're saying is that"
43:24;43:25;"that money wouldn't disappear."
43:25;43:29;"That money would still go towards dealing with these issues,"
43:29;43:31;"but in a different way, and there still would be jobs"
43:31;43:34;"for civic-minded people who maybe wanted to help"
43:34;43:36;"a community have less problems with drugs,"
43:36;43:38;"but it wouldn't necessarily be"
43:38;43:41;"the coercive, punitive way, right?"
43:41;43:42;"- That's right, that's right."
43:42;43:43;"You know, let me tell you a story."
43:43;43:46;"I've been a police scholar for over 20 years."
43:46;43:48;"I know police all over the world."
43:48;43:50;"You know, I talk to police."
43:50;43:51;"You're absolutely right."
43:51;43:53;"They think they're trying to help."
43:53;43:55;"Some police officers came to a talk"
43:55;43:59;"I gave in Houston recently, and we hung out afterwards"
43:59;44:03;"for a little bit and talked, and these were guys of color"
44:03;44:04;"who had grown up in neighborhoods"
44:04;44:06;"where they had been mistreated by police,"
44:06;44:08;"and they thought, I want to do something"
44:08;44:10;"to help the community."
44:10;44:12;"Maybe if I go into policing,"
44:12;44:14;"I can help change the culture of policing,"
44:14;44:16;"and they're like, it didn't work."
44:16;44:19;"We could not change the culture, and I said,"
44:19;44:22;"look, when you were looking to go into the police,"
44:22;44:27;"if you had had the choice between a job as a police officer"
44:27;44:29;"and a job working in a community center,"
44:29;44:33;"coaching football and mentoring teenagers"
44:33;44:35;"for the same pay and benefits,"
44:35;44:37;"which of those jobs would you have taken?"
44:37;44:38;"And of course, they laughed."
44:38;44:41;"They said, oh my God, we would love to have coached football"
44:41;44:43;"and worked with kids in the community"
44:43;44:45;"and helped straighten them out,"
44:45;44:47;"but there were no such jobs."
44:47;44:49;"And I'm like, exactly."
44:49;44:51;"Why are there never those jobs,"
44:51;44:54;"but the police department is always hiring?"
44:54;44:58;"- And we know that when we look at these city budgets,"
44:58;45:00;"it's not because there isn't money,"
45:00;45:02;"because the money is going for the police"
45:02;45:04;"to deal with the same issues,"
45:04;45:06;"which, yeah, which is why getting that money"
45:06;45:09;"to go to other things, it could literally,"
45:09;45:10;"like in this instance you gave,"
45:10;45:13;"this could literally be some of the same people"
45:13;45:15;"who took that job, but if there was another job,"
45:15;45:18;"another choice, I'm sure it'd be less traumatic for them,"
45:18;45:20;"less traumatic for the community."
45:20;45:21;"It makes a lot of sense."
45:21;45:23;"I just hope that in this moment,"
45:23;45:25;"when a lot of eyes are on this issue,"
45:25;45:27;"that it can be linked to the things"
45:27;45:28;"that you're talking about,"
45:28;45:30;"because I think the failure to link them"
45:30;45:34;"is often why these moments kind of flame out quickly."
45:34;45:35;"- I mean, the good news is"
45:35;45:38;"that policing is mostly a local issue,"
45:38;45:41;"and we have these vibrant movements"
45:41;45:43;"in cities across the country,"
45:43;45:46;"so we don't have to fix the nightmare in Washington"
45:46;45:49;"to make some real progress on this."
45:49;45:51;"And local politics, it really matters"
45:51;45:55;"if you can get 100 people to turn out to a budget hearing,"
45:55;45:57;"and we should be able to do that."
45:57;45:59;"And it's happening, it's happening."
45:59;46:02;"- Well, that's good, that's an optimistic note to end on,"
46:02;46:03;"turning out to budget hearings."
46:03;46:04;"That is--"
46:04;46:07;"- I know, it seems weak in some ways,"
46:07;46:09;"but it's an intervention."
46:09;46:10;"- Absolutely."
46:10;46:11;"Well, thanks so much, Alex."
46:11;46:12;"Great talking to you."
46:12;46:13;"I recommend your book to everybody,"
46:13;46:15;"and yeah, we appreciate it."
46:15;46:16;"- You bet."
46:16;46:17;"Thanks for having me on."
46:17;46:18;"- Have a good one."
46:18;46:19;"- Bye-bye."

47:18;47:23;"- Well, Alex S. Vitale, very interesting conversation."
47:23;47:25;"I gotta say, Jake, like for me,"
47:25;47:27;"these connections that are probably very obvious"
47:27;47:30;"to an academic like him who researches this stuff,"
47:30;47:34;"I really think to me and a lot of regular people,"
47:34;47:38;"I have sympathy for people who just want police"
47:38;47:42;"to be less racist and do anti-bias training."
47:42;47:42;"I have sympathy for them."
47:42;47:45;"It's not a crazy idea, right?"
47:45;47:46;"You hear about a racist cop,"
47:46;47:47;"a lot of people are gonna think like,"
47:47;47:49;"""Man, why is that guy racist?"""
47:49;47:51;"Fire him, hold him accountable,"
47:51;47:53;"and make sure that cops in the future are less racist."
47:53;47:58;"It's not crazy, and yet it does seem like it doesn't work."
47:59;48:01;"And there is something about,"
48:01;48:04;"like the moralizing about drugs,"
48:04;48:08;"I really fear that we're never gonna deal with that properly."
48:08;48:10;"You know what I mean? - Of course."
48:10;48:10;"- And it's amazing."
48:10;48:13;"In the past 10 years, everybody's so obsessed"
48:13;48:17;"with narcos and Sicario and Breaking Bad."
48:17;48:21;"People are so interested in drugs as a concept and stuff."
48:21;48:25;"And yet, I guess like Ronald Reagan and Nixon"
48:25;48:27;"and Bill Clinton, they really did a number on everybody."
48:27;48:31;"It's like a lot, a lot of people have fully been convinced"
48:31;48:35;"that drugs are so bad that they need to be illegal,"
48:35;48:37;"and they need to be enforced by people with guns,"
48:37;48:39;"and people need to be thrown in jail."
48:39;48:41;"It's amazing how difficult it is to break through that."
48:41;48:45;"And I've always felt like, it's so insane that,"
48:45;48:46;"yeah, go ahead."
48:46;48:49;"- I mean, I feel like 30, 40, 50 years ago,"
48:49;48:52;"maybe a broader swath of the public"
48:52;48:54;"legitimately feared drugs"
48:54;48:58;"and thought that they would destroy the society."
48:58;49:01;"And I feel like now it's more a sense of political inertia."
49:01;49:05;"I feel like people are now a little more savvy about that."
49:05;49:06;"- Yeah, a little more."
49:06;49:08;"- A little more, and they're just more of like,"
49:08;49:11;"throw their hands up at the impossibility"
49:11;49:16;"of instituting any sort of major reform on a national level."
49:16;49:18;"- Well, obviously we've seen that attitudes"
49:18;49:19;"towards marijuana have shifted,"
49:19;49:20;"and you've faced states where it's legal."
49:20;49:24;"- Yeah, I think that'll change in our lifetime."
49:24;49:27;"You always hear though that even in places like Colorado,"
49:27;49:30;"there's still arresting black and Hispanic people"
49:30;49:34;"at a higher level for marijuana-related charges"
49:34;49:36;"for not following the letter of the law."
49:36;49:38;"So there's always gonna be this lag"
49:38;49:40;"when these federal laws still exist."
49:40;49:42;"It's not gonna be simple,"
49:42;49:44;"but obviously it's gotta be a little bit better."
49:44;49:45;"But yeah, I think you're right."
49:45;49:48;"Well, and one thing, I didn't wanna just summarize"
49:48;49:50;"this whole book to him when we talked to him,"
49:50;49:53;"but one thing that he talks about too though is like,"
49:53;49:53;"I think you're right, Jake,"
49:53;49:57;"that there was a moment definitely in the 20th century"
49:57;50:00;"where the average American did have more extreme feelings"
50:00;50:03;"about drugs being bad and stuff, but it's also--"
50:03;50:04;"- This is your brain."
50:04;50:06;"This is your brain on drugs."
50:06;50:08;"- I mean, we should do a whole episode about that."
50:08;50:10;"'Cause really, the changes in attitude"
50:10;50:11;"towards something, it's marketing."
50:11;50:15;"This was marketed to us about how bad drugs are."
50:15;50:18;"And look, this is where you get into tricky territory,"
50:18;50:19;"'cause there could be somebody listening"
50:19;50:21;"who knows somebody who straight up died"
50:21;50:23;"because of their relationship with drugs."
50:23;50:26;"First of all, less people die when drugs are managed"
50:26;50:28;"and not illegal."
50:28;50:31;"So it doesn't mean that drugs don't have serious problems."
50:31;50:33;"It just means that making them illegal"
50:33;50:36;"and using the cops to enforce it aren't the best tools."
50:36;50:38;"But it's interesting to think about the fact,"
50:38;50:41;"and he kinda, in his book, he gives you like a quick history."
50:41;50:45;"In the 19th century, cocaine, opium,"
50:45;50:48;"and heroin were all legal, and marijuana too."
50:48;50:49;"It's increasingly arbitrated, so like,"
50:49;50:52;"well, why did opium become illegal?"
50:52;50:53;"In the book, he talks about the fact"
50:53;50:57;"that opium was really associated with Chinese people."
50:57;51:00;"And for a long time, there'd be opium dens in Chinatown,"
51:00;51:01;"and nobody really cared."
51:01;51:03;"And then there started to become this thing"
51:03;51:05;"where kind of like upper-class white women,"
51:05;51:08;"it became in vogue for them to go to an opium den"
51:08;51:10;"in Chinatown and get high."
51:10;51:12;"And that's when it started to be seen"
51:12;51:14;"as this kind of racialized thing about racial mixing,"
51:14;51:17;"and we don't want these people together."
51:17;51:19;"And he makes similar cases for how marijuana"
51:19;51:23;"was associated with the Mexican border."
51:23;51:26;"Later, it was associated with jazz music and black people."
51:26;51:29;"And he even talks about, this is really crazy,"
51:29;51:32;"I didn't know this, I always knew that cocaine,"
51:32;51:33;"obviously, Coca-Cola, right,"
51:33;51:35;"used to have cocaine in it, famously."
51:35;51:37;"- Yeah. - So I knew that cocaine"
51:37;51:39;"used to be legal, but this is a really crazy one"
51:39;51:41;"that he talks about in this book."
51:41;51:43;"So cocaine became illegal,"
51:43;51:46;"and was often associated with African-Americans,"
51:46;51:49;"and it was part of this like anger about them taking cocaine."
51:49;51:52;"Before the slaves were free in this country,"
51:52;51:55;"it was not uncommon that slave masters"
51:55;51:57;"would give cocaine to slaves"
51:57;51:59;"to make them work longer and harder."
51:59;52:00;"- Brutal. - There are places"
52:00;52:05;"in this country where people were given cocaine to work,"
52:05;52:07;"and then when they became free"
52:07;52:09;"and occasionally wanted to take it for fun,"
52:09;52:11;"that's when the problem started."
52:11;52:14;"Our attitude and our moralizing about drugs"
52:14;52:15;"is just so out of control."
52:15;52:18;"Another example I was thinking of this,"
52:18;52:20;"'cause I think this is such a fundamental idea"
52:20;52:22;"that I'm still wrapping my head around,"
52:22;52:25;"but we can't take it as a given"
52:25;52:29;"that policing is the way to solve all problems."
52:29;52:32;"And we talked about like the boys in blue"
52:32;52:35;"don't come through with nightsticks and guns"
52:35;52:38;"when a restaurant has like a violation"
52:38;52:40;"with their like oven ventilation."
52:40;52:42;"- Yeah. - We accept as a society"
52:42;52:46;"that if like the stove is too close to the bathroom"
52:46;52:48;"in the kitchen at a restaurant or something,"
52:48;52:51;"we accept that there's a reasonable way to deal with it"
52:51;52:54;"through a fine or through sending in,"
52:54;52:55;"who are the people who are in charge of that?"
52:55;52:57;"Just like in a city, just the city health board."
52:57;52:59;"- Yeah, restaurant inspectors."
52:59;53:01;"- Restaurant inspectors don't haul you into jail."
53:01;53:02;"And then they're just like,"
53:02;53:04;"""You're gonna be in jail for the next six months."""
53:04;53:06;"- You can't make bail."
53:06;53:07;"- Yeah, you can't make bail."
53:07;53:10;"Finally you get out and you gotta go tell the judge like,"
53:10;53:12;"""I will fix the ventilation system."
53:12;53:14;"""I recognize that I pose the danger"
53:14;53:16;"""to the clientele of the restaurant."""
53:16;53:18;"And then the even crazier example, of course,"
53:18;53:20;"is white collar criminals."
53:20;53:23;"We're familiar with the idea of the FBI"
53:23;53:26;"rolling in to maybe arrest somebody."
53:26;53:27;"- Right."
53:27;53:29;"- The idea that just like the local precinct"
53:29;53:31;"would just send a bunch of guys in with guns"
53:31;53:34;"every time there's some sort of like financial impropriety,"
53:34;53:36;"it obviously doesn't happen."
53:36;53:37;"- Right."
53:37;53:38;"- The idea that I could just like call the cops"
53:38;53:40;"and be like, ""I was just in the elevator"
53:40;53:43;"""and there's these really two suspicious guys talking"
53:43;53:44;"""and I think it was insider trading"
53:44;53:46;"""and I'm really stressed out."""
53:46;53:48;"And then just like I call 911"
53:48;53:49;"and then just like five cops come."
53:49;53:50;"They're like, ""Who was it?"""
53:50;53:51;"I was like, ""It was two white guys."
53:51;53:54;"""They were wearing like blue blazers."""
53:54;53:55;"And they just like start throwing dudes on the floor,"
53:55;53:57;"be like, ""You're coming with us."""
53:57;53:58;"It seems like an absurd example,"
53:58;54:00;"but it just kind of reminds us"
54:00;54:02;"that those people broke the law."
54:02;54:04;"They violated the social contract."
54:04;54:06;"And obviously it's an even bigger problem"
54:06;54:09;"that there is never prosecution for bankers or something."
54:09;54:11;"But even then, I'm not saying that these people"
54:11;54:14;"should be thrown on the ground by the police either."
54:14;54:17;"I'm just saying that we as a society have chosen"
54:17;54:19;"which crimes and which problems"
54:19;54:23;"cops with guns and weapons tackle."
54:23;54:24;"And it's not all of them."
54:24;54:25;"And when you start to like take a step back,"
54:25;54:28;"you realize like, yeah, it doesn't help everything"
54:28;54:30;"to like have the cops like,"
54:30;54:33;"or even like if the IRS,"
54:33;54:34;"if you just put the whole IRS"
54:34;54:36;"became part of like the local police force."
54:36;54:37;"- Right."
54:37;54:39;"- Let me see that (beep) receipt."
54:39;54:40;"Like get heads on the ground."
54:40;54:43;"You know, like it doesn't happen for good reason."
54:43;54:44;"♪ Never meant to be you ♪"
54:44;54:46;"♪ Never meant to be me ♪"
54:46;54:51;"♪ Never meant to be us ♪"

55:06;55:10;"♪ And I'll take my time next time ♪"
55:10;55:12;"- I had a thought when you were talking"
55:12;55:14;"about things that used to be legal,"
55:14;55:16;"you know, like in the 19th century."
55:16;55:18;"I mean, when I was done with that protest"
55:18;55:21;"and I was, you know, there's all these like National Guard"
55:21;55:23;"and police who are so heavily armed."
55:23;55:26;"And then I was thinking about a few months ago"
55:26;55:28;"during the COVID thing,"
55:28;55:32;"those like militias going into the state house in Michigan."
55:32;55:35;"And I was like, wow, that would not fly down here"
55:35;55:37;"if people showed up with guns"
55:37;55:40;"just to march down, peacefully march down the street."
55:40;55:41;"I was doing a little reading about it."
55:41;55:46;"And open carry was legal in California until 1967"
55:46;55:50;"when governor Ronald Reagan signed a law"
55:50;55:53;"banning the open carry of weapons in California."
55:53;55:56;"And you have to assume that must go back to like 1849,"
55:56;55:59;"like gold rush, like the wild west."
55:59;56:00;"- Yeah, the wild west."
56:00;56:02;"- You walk in a saloon with a gun."
56:02;56:06;"Now smash cut to 1967, it's like suburban California."
56:06;56:08;"And what's happening is like in Oakland,"
56:08;56:12;"the Black Panthers are walking around their neighborhood,"
56:12;56:15;"patrolling the neighborhood peacefully with shotguns,"
56:15;56:17;"keeping an eye on the cops."
56:17;56:19;"And that did not fly."
56:19;56:20;"That was not a popular thing."
56:20;56:23;"- So then the Republican governor, Ronald Reagan,"
56:23;56:24;"nipped that in the bud."
56:24;56:27;"- It was a wildly popular bipartisan bill"
56:27;56:29;"that passed in 1967."
56:29;56:32;"And then when the bill was being debated in Sacramento,"
56:32;56:35;"the Black Panthers did march"
56:35;56:37;"and walked straight into the Capitol building"
56:37;56:41;"bearing arms and then like peacefully left."
56:41;56:43;"But it was like a strange resonance"
56:43;56:45;"to the militias in Michigan,"
56:45;56:49;"but obviously with completely different results legally."
56:49;56:50;"- That's a great point to make."
56:50;56:51;"- It's just wild."
56:51;56:53;"- And of course you get to get back to alcohol."
56:53;56:54;"- Oh, of course."
56:54;56:57;"- Because we're so familiar with alcohol as being legal,"
56:57;57:00;"because it's been legal for almost all of American history,"
57:00;57:04;"except for one very violent and crime-ridden 10 year period"
57:04;57:06;"when it was illegal in the 20s."
57:06;57:07;"This is what bothered me"
57:07;57:09;"is when you have these conversations"
57:09;57:11;"about like alcohol versus weed,"
57:11;57:13;"people think that's kind of like"
57:13;57:15;"a stoner dorm room conversation."
57:15;57:17;"It's like, I don't know, man."
57:17;57:19;"I feel like alcohol and weed are kind of similar."
57:19;57:21;"And people are like, well, I don't know about me,"
57:21;57:24;"because for me, I had an edible once and I got so high."
57:24;57:26;"Oh my God, I could have been anywhere."
57:26;57:27;"But when I drink, you know,"
57:27;57:29;"it becomes this whole personal debate,"
57:29;57:31;"almost an aesthetic debate too,"
57:31;57:32;"about like, I don't like stoners,"
57:32;57:34;"but you know, I've known some cool alcoholics."
57:34;57:36;"It becomes this whole like really personal thing."
57:36;57:38;"But when you really take a step back"
57:38;57:42;"and you think about the fact that so many people die"
57:42;57:45;"every year from alcohol and alcohol-related stuff."
57:45;57:46;"Driving drunk, whatever."
57:46;57:48;"And you just think about the fact that"
57:48;57:50;"we understand that that's legal."
57:50;57:52;"There's never been a serious conversation"
57:52;57:55;"about making alcohol illegal in our lifetimes."
57:55;57:57;"- Alcohol is way more destructive than weed."
57:57;57:59;"Weed's not really that destructive."
57:59;58:01;"Maybe some people like go just get too far"
58:01;58:04;"down the rabbit hole and kind of sit in front of the TV"
58:04;58:07;"all day smoking weed, but alcohol is,"
58:07;58:08;"I love booze, don't get me wrong,"
58:08;58:13;"but is awful for you and causes a lot of misery."
58:13;58:16;"- It's amazing how much the conversation is often driven"
58:16;58:18;"by just like purely anecdotal bull (beep)"
58:18;58:20;"where like somebody's like,"
58:20;58:23;"I mean, yeah, I've met a few people drink too much,"
58:23;58:26;"but I have a cousin, he hasn't worked in five years."
58:26;58:28;"He literally plays video games and eats Cheetos all day."
58:28;58:30;"He's a stoner."
58:30;58:33;"It's like, okay, man, like that sounds like"
58:33;58:35;"your aunt and uncle ought to have a chat."
58:35;58:39;"That's what's important is that some people like to pretend"
58:39;58:42;"that the right is saying we need law and order"
58:42;58:45;"and the left is kind of like, no man, it's all good."
58:45;58:47;"There's no problems."
58:47;58:49;"It's chill, just chill out."
58:49;58:52;"And truly people have this like idiotic worldview"
58:52;58:54;"that one group of people cares about dealing with stuff."
58:54;58:57;"And the other people saying, no man, we don't need cops."
58:57;59:00;"Everybody can just kind of like hash it out,"
59:00;59:02;"but that's not true either."
59:02;59:04;"And that's why I like Alex's point."
59:04;59:07;"There are problems in communities."
59:07;59:09;"There will always be problems in communities."
59:09;59:11;"And he always uses the phrase harms."
59:11;59:14;"There are many harms associated with alcohol."
59:14;59:16;"There are harms associated with sex work."
59:16;59:18;"The point is not to pretend these are problems"
59:18;59:22;"that we can just like hash out or like not worry about."
59:22;59:25;"It's truly about are there other ways to tackle problems"
59:25;59:29;"besides armed police and criminalization?"
59:29;59:32;"If that's like the one takeaway that we can have,"
59:32;59:35;"and I hope the next generation can like hold on to"
59:35;59:39;"into their adulthood, it's that nobody's pretending"
59:39;59:42;"that there aren't serious problems facing people"
59:42;59:43;"in a world with drugs and alcohol"
59:43;59:46;"and exploitation, all these things."
59:46;59:50;"It's really, are there better ways to solve problems"
59:50;59:51;"than criminalization and police?"
59:51;59:54;"That's the question you have to ask over and over again."
59:54;59:57;"And we're not like built to ask that question."
59:57;59:59;"You know, like we're built to like get up in arms"
59:59;01:00:01;"about like, you know, brutality and stuff,"
01:00:01;01:00:04;"but we're not trained."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"Like every kid, for instance, in, I don't know about like"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"in the deep South or something."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"I'm curious if any listeners are from the deep South."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"Us like Northeast blue state types,"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"we grew up in our history book,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"learning about the civil rights movement."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"They didn't pretend to call the civil war"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"the war of Northern aggression or something like that."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"We were raised to understand that,"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"at least in a really basic way,"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"the treatment of black people"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"and native Americans was horrifying."
01:00:31;01:00:35;"We understood that the civil rights movement was just,"
01:00:35;01:00:40;"we saw the images of peaceful protesters being harassed"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"and brutalized by police."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"I was taught that in a pretty basic public school."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"I know that's not true all over the country,"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"but I was taught that."
01:00:48;01:00:48;"- As was I."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"- But the one thing that nobody's being taught in schools"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"is stuff like this, war on drug,"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"these concepts about why are certain things criminal"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"and other things aren't."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Those ideas seem so fundamental"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"to eventually solving these problems."
01:01:02;01:01:06;"If all you leave a student with is like this feeling"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"of like, man, I would never go like tell a black person"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"they couldn't use a water fountain."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"All right, cool."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"In that sense, you're better than a white person"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"in the Jim Crow South,"
01:01:16;01:01:19;"but you still accept these other ideas."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- Well, right."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"It's like the education,"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"like the story of Americans and progress kind of ends"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"in like 1980 or something."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"The thing that I fear is that you have a lot of people"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"right now saying people, especially white people"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"need to educate themselves about the history of racism"
01:01:35;01:01:36;"in this country."
01:01:36;01:01:37;"Agreed."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"I 100% agree."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"There's a lot of ways to tell that story though."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"And there's a version that the powers that be"
01:01:44;01:01:48;"might prefer to be told that focuses on the 1960s,"
01:01:48;01:01:53;"that focuses on the racial biases of individuals"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"like bad cops and individual bad people"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"and never talks about stuff like the war on drugs"
01:01:58;01:02:02;"or the history of the racialized criminalization of drugs,"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"things like that."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"Like, you know what I mean?"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"It's like the lame version always wins."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"So if we're hitting this point in American society"
01:02:09;01:02:12;"where you got everybody, every brand, for instance,"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"and we'll talk about that more,"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"every brand from Ben and Jerry's to Amazon"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"is chiming in about racial injustice."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Okay, the topic is out there,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"but what version of it is the one"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"that's gonna be discussed at the dinner table"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"and discussed in school?"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"And the fact that the war on drugs"
01:02:30;01:02:33;"isn't like a big chapter in like a high school textbook,"
01:02:33;01:02:36;"that's one of the defining features of American society"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"of the past 50 years."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"It's transformative."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"Anyway, we can go on about this forever,"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"but I do have to say that I recommend his book."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"And if you don't have time to read a whole book,"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"I always recommend the documentary"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"that Ava DuVernay made called ""13th."""
01:02:50;01:02:51;"Just talks about the 13th Amendment,"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"talks about the war on drugs,"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"talks about the relationship of slavery"

01:02:59;01:03:01;"It's on Netflix."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"It talks about these crucial moments,"
01:03:02;01:03:06;"Nix and Clinton, the presidents who really changed"

01:03:09;01:03:11;"and specifically African-Americans."

01:04:02;01:04:04;"for a camping trip in Eastern Oregon"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"or that type of stuff that you do?"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"- Yeah, we're gonna do some camping up in the Sierras"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"this summer and then go visit my folks."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"We're doing that in July."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Although, it's a little ambiguous"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"depending on the COVID situation,"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"whether in stage two or three."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"But yes, that is the plan."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"But nothing that--"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"- Right, you're starting to think about traveling"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"elsewhere in the state."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"- But just driving in the minivan with the dog"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"up into the mountains and nothing crazy."
01:04:28;01:04:31;"- Well, there's a friend of the show"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"who's always a little bit ahead of the curve."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"He's not waiting that long."
01:04:35;01:04:38;"He's back out there on the highways and byways"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"of the United States of America."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"And of course, I'm talking about winter."
01:04:41;01:04:45;"I was very moved to see on Winter's Instagram and Twitter"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"that he was back out there starbucking again."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"And I can't wait to hear from him."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"It was almost a little emotional."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"I saw him post somewhere where he was like,"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"""This is my first time sitting down in a Starbucks"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"in three months."""
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- Yeah."
01:04:57;01:05:00;"- And I was like, ""Damn, that's intense."""
01:05:00;01:05:03;"'Cause he was very much confined up there"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"in Rochester, New York."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"So anyway, we're gonna check in with Winter"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"who has been back at it again,"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"starbucking across the country."
01:05:10;01:05:13;"And as I understand, attending some protests."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"So he's probably gonna have a lot of information for us"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"about what's happening out there"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"in the United States of America."
01:05:18;01:05:22;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"(phone ringing)"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"- Hello?"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"- Oh, hey, what's up, Winter?"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- Hey, how are you folks?"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"- Welcome back."
01:05:30;01:05:30;"- Yeah, glad to be back."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"- To Time Crisis and back to starbucking."
01:05:32;01:05:36;"- Yeah, I was going to do it from my car"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"outside the new Starbucks in Flagstaff,"
01:05:38;01:05:42;"but then I looked across the parking lot"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"and there's a Planet Fitness there."
01:05:44;01:05:45;"And I gave them a call."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"And they actually had their showers working."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Most don't."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"So it was good to take a shower after a lot of days."
01:05:52;01:05:56;"- Right, 'cause Planet Fitness is when you're starbucking"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"and sometimes you sleep in the car."
01:05:57;01:06:01;"Planet Fitness is one of your go-to shower resources."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"- Yeah, and working out, you know."
01:06:02;01:06:06;"So I like to try to get a run in even while I'm traveling."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"- So you made it from Rochester, New York"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"to Flagstaff, Arizona in a week?"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"How long have you been back out on the road?"
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- I left a week ago, Friday night,"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"from my co-working space in Rochester."
01:06:17;01:06:19;"- You know, following you on social media,"
01:06:19;01:06:23;"I feel like I saw you were in Missouri and not too..."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Colorado."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"So you've just been burning across the country."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"- Yeah, but I could have done this drive"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"in like two or three days,"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"except that I had to stop and work"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"and I had to stop and protest."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"So things that you have to do and things that are important."
01:06:36;01:06:40;"So Starbucks is the main purpose of being on the road"
01:06:40;01:06:43;"to catch up on all these stores"
01:06:43;01:06:48;"before the global recession leads to hundreds of closures,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"like happened 10 years ago."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"- Oh, wow."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"Your forecast is that a lot of these Starbucks"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"that you're maybe going to right now"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"might not be there in a couple of years."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"- Or within the next year."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"That is my pessimistic forecast"
01:07:01;01:07:06;"based on the great purge of 2008, 2009."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"But I'm not an economist."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I don't have access to any data."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"This is just purely my gut telling me"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"that some of these stores might not survive."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"As of a week ago when I left,"
01:07:18;01:07:22;"there were still six US stores that I had not been to"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"that had not reopened."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"And I don't know why."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"I'm hoping that they will reopen."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"The biggest one that I'm worried about"
01:07:29;01:07:34;"is the Salesforce building in downtown San Francisco."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"That's a new building that Salesforce,"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"this growing IT company built."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"They opened up a Starbucks there, corporate,"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"initially not open to the public,"
01:07:45;01:07:50;"but I was told that it would be opening to the public."
01:07:50;01:07:54;"The question is, will they reopen that store"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"after Salesforce announced that they're going to let"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"a lot of their employees continue to work from home?"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"- Right."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"So where have you stopped to protest?"
01:08:05;01:08:09;"- I found myself at the new Starbucks in Reynoldsburg"
01:08:09;01:08:13;"just outside Columbus, Ohio last, I guess, Saturday night."
01:08:13;01:08:18;"And I actually found a place where I could dine in,"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"plug in my computer, charge everything up."
01:08:21;01:08:23;"And I started Googling around and I realized,"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"hey, wait a minute,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"there's probably some protests going on downtown."
01:08:26;01:08:31;"So I headed downtown and the streets were all closed,"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"but I parked my car and managed to find where,"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"you know, people were protesting."
01:08:34;01:08:38;"And that was a chaotic scene with people throwing bottles."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And then at some point rocks at the police."
01:08:41;01:08:44;"That's not what I was looking to get into."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"So I just observed and, you know,"
01:08:47;01:08:50;"that's where I noticed that the police were sort of,"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"when they felt people were getting too rowdy,"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"they would move from block to block and clear the block"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"with the rubber bullets."
01:08:56;01:08:59;"And of course everybody would move in the other direction."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I don't know how long it went,"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"but you know, once it started to get dark,"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"I had to get out of there."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"I was exhausted."
01:09:05;01:09:08;"And I also have trouble seeing at night now,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"just something that comes with age."
01:09:10;01:09:14;"I had to get glasses recently and I broke them already."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"It's been less than a month and I sat on them."
01:09:16;01:09:20;"- Yeah, that sounds intense."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"- Yeah."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"- It seems like I've seen a few images"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"of people vandalizing Starbucks."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Have you been following this at all?"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"- Absolutely."
01:09:27;01:09:28;"People are tweeting them at me."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"It's all over the news."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"I've passed Starbucks that were boarded up."
01:09:32;01:09:36;"I personally did not see anybody attacking a Starbucks."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"I did see some guy attacking another business"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"and that's when the rubber bullets came out."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"Seems like protecting property is a high priority."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"- Right."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"- I mean, you know, it's like, you can't blame them."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"- When you see images of a defaced Starbucks,"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"do you feel any type of way about it?"
01:09:51;01:09:53;"- No, honestly, I don't."
01:09:53;01:09:56;"What's going on in the country is so important"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"and what's been going on with past protests"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"like Occupy Wall Street and some of the protests"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"surrounding the, what is it?"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"The World Trade Organization, right?"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"- Oh yeah, in Seattle."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"- Some of those, Starbucks is often a target"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"because they're a symbol of big corporations."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"It's unfortunate."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"I wish it didn't happen,"
01:10:15;01:10:20;"but I'm not going to take Starbucks' side."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"I guess my position is they can absorb the loss."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"- Yes."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"- The protesting is important."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"What's going on here right now in this country"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"is much more important than a hit"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"that Starbucks takes to their profits."
01:10:32;01:10:36;"I certainly don't want any of their baristas to get hurt."
01:10:36;01:10:37;"Don't want anybody to get hurt."
01:10:37;01:10:41;"I know that some of them probably fearing for their safety"
01:10:41;01:10:42;"and I wish them well."
01:10:42;01:10:42;"I feel bad for them,"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"but there's a whole group of Americans"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"who feel for their safety every day."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"They're alive."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"- Absolutely, and that's a good point"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"because if you're talking about a moment"
01:10:51;01:10:55;"where you heard about baristas getting hurt, for instance,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"that would be such a different equation"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"'cause then you're saying,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"is it okay for bystanders to get hurt"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"in a protest about police violence?"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"Of course not."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"Nobody would defend that."
01:11:04;01:11:09;"Is it okay for somebody to spray paint or smash a window"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"in a handful of people"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"in the course of a much larger protest?"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"That's not something to get up in arms about."
01:11:14;01:11:17;"And as you said, Starbucks can absorb it."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"We're not talking about the tiny mom and pop coffee spot."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"Those are the ones that I feel the worst for,"
01:11:23;01:11:27;"especially coming on the heels of the pandemic."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"You have to feel for those people."
01:11:29;01:11:29;"- Absolutely."
01:11:29;01:11:32;"So what have you been seeing just in the American coffee scene"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"now that you're back on the road?"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"'Cause I know when you go out,"
01:11:35;01:11:36;"you're not only hitting Starbucks, right?"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"You're checking out the mom and pops too."
01:11:38;01:11:42;"- Right, it's a wide array of modes of operation."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"This morning I was doing some work"
01:11:44;01:11:48;"at Trifecta Coffee Company in Albuquerque"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"and they had their patio open,"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"but they were also pretty cool"
01:11:52;01:11:56;"about letting me charge my equipment just inside the door"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"while I was outside taking meetings."
01:11:58;01:12:02;"Others are walk-up window only,"
01:12:02;01:12:05;"like Sweet Bloom in Denver."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Best cup of coffee that I've had in, I don't know,"
01:12:08;01:12:12;"six months, just amazing, amazing brew there."
01:12:12;01:12:13;"It's been running the gamut."
01:12:13;01:12:16;"And if any barista seems more anxious"
01:12:16;01:12:20;"to get the customers out of there as quickly as possible,"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"I'm definitely going to respect that"
01:12:21;01:12:25;"because from their perspective, it's a health issue."
01:12:25;01:12:26;"They don't want to get sick and die"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"or bring it home to their family members."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:12:29;01:12:33;"I saw on Instagram that you did go sit"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"in at least one Starbucks."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"So have you been to Starbucks"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"or that are fully back to normal?"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"- That is the only one in Evergreen, Colorado"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"that I have run into."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"I know that there are more"
01:12:44;01:12:48;"because either the manager or the district manager"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"who was there giving instructions to the other partners"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"indicated to me that they were a trial store."
01:12:53;01:12:56;"Based on how it goes,"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"they'll use that to inform the processes"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"that will be used at other stores"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"as they open up their cafe seating."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"But I don't have a list of which stores"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"have open lobbies as of right now."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"- At the Evergreen, Colorado Starbucks,"
01:13:12;01:13:13;"what was the vibe inside?"
01:13:13;01:13:14;"Were there were people just sitting down?"
01:13:14;01:13:17;"Were they being forced to- - There was literally nobody."
01:13:17;01:13:18;"Literally nobody."
01:13:18;01:13:21;"I got there on, what was it, a couple nights ago?"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"I guess Wednesday night, maybe, about 7.30."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"They were closing at eight."
01:13:26;01:13:30;"There was a lady customer and the manager,"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"district manager was explaining to her that she could sit,"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"but she opted to leave."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"I stuck around and just charged up my stuff,"
01:13:37;01:13:38;"uploaded my photos."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"I returned the next morning to get breakfast"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"and just continue to charge up,"
01:13:43;01:13:45;"download a bunch of stuff, upload photos,"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"figure out what I was gonna do for the day."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"And there was nobody there."
01:13:48;01:13:52;"So I have not yet been in a Starbucks situation"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"where there were other customers."
01:13:54;01:13:58;"Similarly, PT's Coffee in Topeka, Kansas."
01:13:58;01:14:01;"That was the first independent coffee house"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"that I'd encountered since this pandemic started"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"that had a dine-in seating."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"When I was there, there was one lady"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"in the middle of the store working."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"She was not wearing a mask."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"All the baristas were wearing a mask."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"I took my coffee and I headed off"
01:14:13;01:14:16;"to the furthest corner I could find,"
01:14:16;01:14:17;"and then I was able to work."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"I felt comfortable working without a mask"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"'cause I was a good couple hundred meters,"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"maybe 300 meters away from the baristas behind the counter."
01:14:25;01:14:26;"- Well, so where are you heading?"
01:14:26;01:14:29;"You're almost back in California, it sounds like."
01:14:29;01:14:33;"- Almost, give or take a few dozen Starbucks."
01:14:33;01:14:37;"My next one, I guess, would be down in Cottonwood, Arizona,"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"then down to Phoenix tomorrow,"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"simply because there's indications"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"that there's different marches in different areas planned."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"So I want to hook up with a march."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"Hopefully the heat won't kill me."
01:14:51;01:14:54;"- Daytime downtown Phoenix, that sounds pretty cool."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"- I don't know how my body's gonna handle that."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"A few time crisis episodes ago,"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"I was talking about the sprint Scrabble,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"where you play Scrabble and then run."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"And the very first time that I did that"
01:15:05;01:15:09;"was down in Orlando, middle of the summer,"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"during the National Scrabble Championship,"
01:15:10;01:15:13;"around 1 or 2 p.m., humidity in the air."
01:15:13;01:15:16;"I had to forfeit because I was starting to get dizzy."
01:15:16;01:15:20;"I was just not used to running in the heat."
01:15:20;01:15:21;"So it's gonna be interesting to see"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"how I handle walking in the heat tomorrow,"
01:15:23;01:15:26;"if it's something that starts at noon or 1 p.m."
01:15:26;01:15:27;"I haven't been able to figure out yet"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"exactly where the best march is."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"- And so you have a whole route?"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Are you doing kind of like a U?"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"Will you end up back in Rochester?"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"- I will end up back in Rochester."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"My route keeps changing every time I look at the map."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I'm just making judgment calls"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"about which Starbucks I'm going to skip"
01:15:44;01:15:47;"and just hope that they don't shut down"
01:15:47;01:15:50;"because time-wise, in a month,"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"I cannot get to every Starbucks"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"you would have seen on the map that I posted last week"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"or the map that's on my website right now."
01:15:57;01:16:00;"There's just like, I'm in Flagstaff."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"I was in Gallup, New Mexico earlier."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"I could have gone down to Show Low,"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"but that was just too big a detour."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"I couldn't make it to Show Low,"
01:16:08;01:16:11;"then back up to Flagstaff in time for my happy hour,"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"virtual happy hour with the folks at work."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"I just burn too much time"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"if I tried to get every single store."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"And there's another factor."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"I'm not going to get all the stores anyway"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"because COVID closures."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"So that's the other new thing."
01:16:25;01:16:28;"Kansas City, Missouri, I had to leave one store there"
01:16:28;01:16:31;"because somebody had tested positive for COVID."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"And what Starbucks is doing is shutting the store down."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"I was told two weeks."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"I was told the same thing about a store"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"in Littleton, Colorado."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"That's the second one that I encountered"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"that was closed due to this."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"- Where an employee had COVID"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"and they shut down for two weeks."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- And so I have every reason to think"
01:16:48;01:16:51;"that I'm going to encounter stores"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"somewhere in Arizona, California,"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"all the way up through Oregon, Washington."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Just law of averages says that somebody"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"is going to test positive and they're going"
01:16:58;01:16:59;"to shut the store down."
01:16:59;01:17:02;"It might not necessarily be for two weeks each time."
01:17:02;01:17:05;"I just read about a store in Aldergrove."
01:17:05;01:17:08;"I think that's up in BC, but that's Canada."
01:17:08;01:17:09;"Somebody tested positive."
01:17:09;01:17:11;"They had it shut down for two days."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"So I'm not exactly sure."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"- Just give it a good scrub."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"- How long?"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"- Send them home, give it a good scrub."
01:17:16;01:17:19;"What I was told by a barista in Kansas City,"
01:17:19;01:17:23;"Missouri, was they want everybody to isolate"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"for the 14 day period."
01:17:24;01:17:28;"- So they don't have any employees to come work."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"- That's what my understanding is."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"But again, this isn't necessarily being handled"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"this exact same way in every region of the United States."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Might not be handled the same way in Canada."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"And certainly other countries."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"- The district manager is going to have some autonomy"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"about their response."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"- That's what Kevin Johnson explicitly said"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"in an email that went out to everybody on the app,"
01:17:48;01:17:52;"that these decisions were going to be made at a local level."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"- Well, thanks so much for checking in, Winter."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"Stay safe and I hope you have a great time"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"at the protest tomorrow."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"- Just want to do my part."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"I feel like something is happening right now"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"and I want to contribute."
01:18:04;01:18:08;"Honestly, I feel guilty that I haven't protested more"
01:18:08;01:18:11;"during my life, but I guess better late than never, right?"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"- Who knows, you might be in the top one percentile"
01:18:13;01:18:17;"of Americans covering geographic range for protests"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"due to your lifestyle."
01:18:19;01:18:21;"- Sure, but let's not, definitely don't want"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"to make this about me."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"- Right, of course, but you're out there"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"at a lot of different places, so that's pretty cool."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"All right, well, great, man."
01:18:26;01:18:28;"Good luck and we'll check in again soon."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"- Wonderful talking to you."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Good to see you guys."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"- Good to see you, Winter."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"- Take care and be safe."
01:18:33;01:18:36;"I know that you're protesting too, Jake, so be safe."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- You too, bud."
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- Winter, before you go, are you on,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"do you play Words with Friends?"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"(Winter whistling)"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"(Winter laughing)"
01:18:43;01:18:43;"- Wait."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"Damn, ice cold."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"- Oh my God, I'll have to text you."
01:18:50;01:18:51;"- You just, ice cute."
01:18:51;01:18:54;"No, that was just an accident, but that was some timing."
01:18:54;01:18:57;"Just a sign for, Winter, do you play Words with Friends?"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"No, psh."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"- Winter, would you be my Facebook friend?"
01:19:03;01:19:07;"(singing in foreign language)"
01:19:16;01:19:41;"- All right, so next up, we're gonna check in"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"with a friend of the show, Mero,"
01:19:43;01:19:45;"see what's going on with him,"
01:19:45;01:19:49;"see if he has any takes on what's happening in the country."
01:19:49;01:19:51;"I know he does."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"So let's go ahead and get him on the phone and check in."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:19:57;01:20:00;"(phone ringing)"
01:20:00;01:20:01;"- Hey!"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"- Mero, welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"- Very good to be back."
01:20:04;01:20:07;"I haven't spoken to you in over nine hours,"
01:20:07;01:20:08;"you know what I'm saying?"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"- That's true."
01:20:09;01:20:10;"We were on the phone yesterday,"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"but that wasn't being recorded, I hope."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"But--"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"- It might be."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"We were on--"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"- I mean, you never know."
01:20:17;01:20:17;"- It was a very boring NSA conversation."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"- But welcome back to the show."
01:20:19;01:20:21;"It depends if we said any of those key words that start,"
01:20:21;01:20:24;"isn't that like the law that if there's certain key words,"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"they can just start the tape recording?"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"- I need a list of those words so I can just say them"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"as soon as I get on the phone with somebody"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"instead of saying hello."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"I can just get on the phone and be like,"
01:20:31;01:20:34;"yo, Antifa, death to the West, yo, America must fall."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"- Yeah."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"(laughing)"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Well, I think it's just to kick things off,"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"we were gonna do a segment where"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"we were talking to this academic"
01:20:42;01:20:45;"before a professor of sociology"
01:20:45;01:20:47;"and also writer, Alex S. Vitale,"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"about his book ""End of Policing."""
01:20:48;01:20:51;"So, you know, he was giving us kinda like the facts"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"about the origins of policing"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"and why things or certain things are criminalized."
01:20:56;01:20:57;"But we also wanted to start talking about"
01:20:57;01:21:00;"just some of the responses we've seen in culture."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"So we were gonna look through that a little bit,"
01:21:02;01:21:05;"starting with some notable celebrities."
01:21:05;01:21:08;"One that caught our eye was Chris Novoselic."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"You know who that is, just by name, Mero?"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"- From Nirvana?"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"- Yeah, 'cause you're like a big fan, right?"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"- I'm an Interpol stan, but I (beep) Nirvana too."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"You know what I mean?"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"I'm very like '90s alternative."
01:21:20;01:21:23;"- Don't worry, Paul Banks hasn't said anything weird."
01:21:23;01:21:23;"(laughing)"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"But--"
01:21:24;01:21:27;"- I don't gotta, I gotta cancel, I gotta delete,"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"turn on the bright lights and (beep) now?"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"- Everything's cool in the Interpol world."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"Even though when you think about it,"
01:21:33;01:21:37;"Interpol is actually a portmanteau for international police."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"- Yes!"
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Yo!"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"- When you really break it down, so."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"- Open your third eye."
01:21:42;01:21:44;"- But this is a, what Chris Novoselic,"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"this just really surprised us."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Maybe just 'cause we hadn't checked in"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"with Chris Novoselic in a while."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"But he went on Facebook after Trump gave"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"his June 1st law and order speech,"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"where he threatened to deploy heavily armed soldiers"
01:21:55;01:21:56;"and military personnel."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"And Chris Novoselic wrote, ""Wow,"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"""I know many of you can't stand him."
01:22:00;01:22:03;"""However, Trump knocked it out of the park with his speech."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"""I agree, the president should not be sending troops"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"""into states, and he legally might not be able"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"""to do so anyway."
01:22:08;01:22:12;"""Nevertheless, the tone in this speech is strong and direct."""
01:22:12;01:22:13;"And then he said, ""All the violence appears"
01:22:13;01:22:16;"""as a leftist insurrection."""
01:22:16;01:22:18;"And he said, ""Imagine if so-called patriot militias"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"""were raising this kind of hell."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"""If this were the case, left-wing people"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"""would welcome federal intervention."""
01:22:23;01:22:25;"I mean, first of all, it's so weird"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"that he would take this kind of tone,"
01:22:27;01:22:30;"because it'd be one thing if you just found out"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"Chris Novoselic was fully MAGA."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"It's really like, what's the point of getting out there"
01:22:34;01:22:37;"and being like, ""I don't agree with that the president"
01:22:37;01:22:38;"""should be able to send troops in."""
01:22:38;01:22:40;"But I love his speech."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"It's like such a weird way to frame it."
01:22:42;01:22:46;"- Yo, Kurt Cobain is like, ""Who's man says this?"""
01:22:46;01:22:46;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Like, yo, come on, man."
01:22:49;01:22:52;"Also remember, there was a concert."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"I don't remember if, this is a very vivid memory"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"about the name of my brain, 'cause it was like early on"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"when I first got cable for the first time."
01:22:58;01:23:01;"There was a concert with Nirvana where Chris"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"threw the guitar up in the air,"
01:23:03;01:23:06;"and the (beep) hit him directly in the head on the brain."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"He might have a TBI."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"He might have a TBI."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"That's why he's talking all brazy like that."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"- People always talk about it with NFL players."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"They don't talk about it enough with musicians."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"- I don't know, like, I've held guitars."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Like, they're heavy, dog."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"And he threw that (beep) real high in the air."
01:23:21;01:23:23;"- I can picture that immediately when you describe that."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"That's the type of thing that, like,"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"you could almost kill somebody."
01:23:26;01:23:28;"- Yeah, but yeah, that's a bozo response."
01:23:28;01:23:31;"Like, you know what I'm saying?"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"Sorry, Chris, I'm trying to spit it for you,"
01:23:33;01:23:36;"but nah, that ain't gonna work."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"- Well, I found a great quote from him."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"It says, describing his political views,"
01:23:39;01:23:43;"I'm an anarcho-capitalist socialist moderate."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"- Okay."
01:23:44;01:23:46;"- That's the Tiger Woods, I'm your agent."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"- Couldn't be more contradictory."
01:23:48;01:23:53;"Anarcho-capitalist socialist moderate."
01:23:53;01:23:56;"It's, that is the biggest, like, jumble of-"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"- What the (beep) is that?"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"- Wait, Jake, you're probably the biggest Nirvana fan here."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"- You were back in high school, in college?"
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Yeah, dying."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"- Yeah, wait, you were like, what, 15"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"when ""Nevermind"" came out?"
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- Yeah, 13 or 14, yeah."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- That must have hit you real hard."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Oh yeah, yeah, you'd been 14."
01:24:12;01:24:13;"So I know you're a big fan."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"I guess one thing that's interesting to me is, like,"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"I'm not trying to, like, stir (beep),"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"but I've seen it framed by people before"
01:24:19;01:24:23;"that Kurt and Crist, they were, like, best friends, right?"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"'Cause they grew up together in the small,"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"as Kurt Cobain once put it, redneck town"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"in Washington State, and that they were best friends."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"They kind of were always together,"
01:24:32;01:24:36;"and that Dave Grohl, being from the East Coast,"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"being a little bit younger, he was always the odd man out."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"And I have no idea if it's true or just idle gossip."
01:24:41;01:24:44;"Even people trying to do, like, YouTube videos"
01:24:44;01:24:45;"trying to be like, oh yeah,"
01:24:45;01:24:48;"Kurt never really was down with Dave or something."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Are you familiar with this?"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"- Yeah, I think there was maybe, like, a class thing."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"Like, those guys were from these poor, working-class"
01:24:54;01:24:55;"families in Aberdeen, Washington,"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"and Grohl came from, like, a fairly wealthy family"
01:24:58;01:25:01;"in, like, the D.C. suburbs."
01:25:01;01:25:01;"- Yeah."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"- So, I don't know if there was, like, really true beef,"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"but maybe there was just, like, an inherent, like,"
01:25:06;01:25:07;"discomfort."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"- And also, Dave Grohl was,"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"he wasn't the original drummer, right?"
01:25:11;01:25:14;"- Yeah, yeah, he was, like, the third drummer, I think."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"- So he might also have been, like, kind of, like,"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"eternal new guy syndrome?"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"- Yeah, no, I think Crist,"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Crist, AKA Chris,"
01:25:22;01:25:25;"I never got a handle on that."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"And Kurt were, like, friends from, like, middle school"
01:25:27;01:25:30;"when they were, like, the two weirdo punk kids"
01:25:30;01:25:33;"in this, like, kind of, like, flannel, redneck,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"rural Washington town."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"- They probably felt like they were in the trenches together"
01:25:37;01:25:41;"being weirdo punk rock dudes in Aberdeen, Washington."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"But one thing I gotta say is,"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"people were also saying, well, Chris never started"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"sending this weird, vaguely pro-Trump stuff,"
01:25:46;01:25:47;"or not so vaguely,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"but then Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters,"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"they put out, like, the Black Square,"
01:25:51;01:25:53;"just, like, Black Lives Matter kind of post,"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"and people were like, there you have it,"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"like, two differing schools of thought."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"I don't know, I don't wanna read into it too much,"
01:25:57;01:26:01;"but would Kurt have been more on the Chris line?"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Were they more allies or something?"
01:26:03;01:26:06;"- Ooh, spicy. - I don't know, like,"
01:26:06;01:26:09;"it doesn't fit at all with Kurt's professed values."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"- But then it wouldn't have fit at all"
01:26:10;01:26:13;"with Chris' professed values in 1994."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"This is a classic thing of, like, would John Lennon,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"like, what would have John Lennon thought of Trump?"
01:26:18;01:26:20;"You see people, like, on Twitter being like,"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"oh yeah, he would have loved Trump,"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"and I don't understand."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"- Wait, you saw, people say John Lennon"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"would have loved Trump?"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- Absolutely."
01:26:27;01:26:29;"- Maybe just in the sense of, like,"
01:26:29;01:26:33;"old '60s rock stars turned into hypocritical old ass."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"I mean, I doubt it."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"I think Kurt was, like, really tight with, like,"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"Michael Stipe and, like, was really into, like,"
01:26:39;01:26:42;"queer, like, trans sort of, like, identities"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"when it was, like, out there in '93."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"He was wearing dresses on stage and sh-t."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"- The only thing that I'll say is,"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"and first of all, rest in peace, Kurt."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"I'm sorry that I even brought your name up"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"because you will always be--"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"- I think it was made with the Who's My Ancestor?"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- Oh, yeah, no, no."
01:26:58;01:26:58;"It was Mero."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"(laughing)"
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- Yo, it's not recurrent."
01:27:01;01:27:01;"I love you."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"You influence my youth."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"- Mero brought up the Kurt's ghost,"
01:27:04;01:27:08;"but I will say, when I think of two people"
01:27:08;01:27:12;"who are, you know, often considered very transgressive"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"figures and controversial figures,"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"that people would not have guessed"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"would ever come to anything close to a right-wing stance,"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"two people that come to mind are Kanye West,"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"who apparently is donating money to George Floyd's family,"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"so who knows with Kanye, but that was the thing."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"I think that's why people talk about it so much"
01:27:28;01:27:31;"is because, again, I'm not trying to be morbid,"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"but let's say Kanye died when he was 27."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"That timing doesn't work"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"'cause that's probably before he put out his music,"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"but let's say Kanye died-- - Late bloomer."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Let's say Kanye died after--"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"- The purposes of the conversation, yeah, no, I feel you."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"- Yeah, let's say Kanye died after graduation,"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"and then suddenly Trump was in office"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"and you had somebody being like,"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"you know, if Kanye was alive, man,"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"he would like Trump's showmanship."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"I bet he'd be wearing a MAGA hat."
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Everybody would be like, shut the (beep) up."
01:27:54;01:27:55;"You, how dare you?"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"- You mean Jesus walks?"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"- Right. - How dare you?"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"- And they'd be pulling up the video of him saying,"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"George Bush doesn't care about black people,"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"and you're like, you're telling me this, man."
01:28:04;01:28:05;"Nobody would buy that."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"And then the other person I think of is Morrissey,"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"who even though he was always kind of cagey,"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"he was less politically direct than Michael Stipe,"
01:28:12;01:28:16;"you know, Morrissey, before Kurt Cobain,"
01:28:16;01:28:19;"was a very, like, an important figure in like,"
01:28:19;01:28:23;"he absolutely influenced a generation of fans"
01:28:23;01:28:26;"to like, think differently about sexuality and stuff."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"I think he would be surprised"
01:28:27;01:28:28;"that now he's got this reputation"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"as a kind of right wing dude."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Although that was starting to,"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"elements of that was poking its head at earlier."

01:29:26;01:29:33;"- Chris Nogosel is always been a fascinating character"
01:29:33;01:29:36;"to me too, because he's been pretty quiet"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"since the Nirvana years."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"And it's just like, you know,"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"that's the funny thing about like music and bands and stuff,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"especially that era when selling records"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"used to make a ton of money."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Like he basically, I'm not trying to diss him."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"He was a great bassist,"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"but he happened to grow up in this weird small town"
01:29:51;01:29:55;"with a generational talent, a genius, Kurt Cobain."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"I'm sure they loved each other, had real brotherhood."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"They created this band together."
01:29:59;01:30:02;"And then that generational talent genius dude"
01:30:02;01:30:06;"kills himself after barely starting to even have a career."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"They had three years of being big."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Look at Pearl Jam."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"They could have been playing stadiums right now."
01:30:12;01:30:15;"But then so suddenly, 1994, it all goes away."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"You barely got started."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"And now you're sitting on so much money."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"Again, I'm not saying that that affected his politics,"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"but that's just like a weird ass life"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"to be like a dude in your late twenties,"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"your best friend kills himself,"
01:30:27;01:30:30;"but you also now have an unlimited source of money"
01:30:30;01:30:32;"for the rest of your life, which is weird."
01:30:32;01:30:34;"That's just a weird life, you know?"
01:30:34;01:30:34;"- Facts."
01:30:34;01:30:37;"Like, I don't even know like how I would move"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"in that scenario, you know what I'm saying?"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"'Cause it's like, I know the values that I was raised with"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"or whatever, you know what I'm saying?"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"Which is wild because on like the last podcast I did,"
01:30:47;01:30:51;"I was just like, yo, if I really said out loud"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"like the politics that I was raised under,"
01:30:54;01:30:56;"motherfuckers would get me out of here so fast."
01:30:56;01:30:57;"You know what I mean?"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Like, they'd be like, oh, he's a socialist demon."
01:30:59;01:31:00;"Get him out of here."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"So like, I don't even talk too much about that."
01:31:02;01:31:07;"- Because your family was so left-wing coming from the DR."
01:31:07;01:31:08;"- Right, so they're from the part of the Dominican Republic"
01:31:08;01:31:11;"where it's just like, it's black."
01:31:11;01:31:12;"Like it is black."
01:31:12;01:31:15;"It's like, see, wow, it's like, basically like next to,"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"it is Haiti, it's on the border."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"So like, there's this guy who not a lot of people know about"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"if they're not Dominican, Jose Francisco Peña Gomez,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"who is like the darkest dark-skinned dude"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"you could ever see in your life."
01:31:28;01:31:32;"And he was like a national hero for my entire family."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"And then he died from pancreatic cancer"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"and hit the fan and it was all fucked up."
01:31:37;01:31:38;"And now my dad, all he does is like complain"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"about politics in the DR."
01:31:40;01:31:44;"So like with those like values and seeing that,"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"like and seeing what's happening now,"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"I almost want to be like, yo, it ain't enough."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"The way people approach like injustice here"
01:31:51;01:31:54;"is not the same way that people approach injustice"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"in like other countries, especially like developing nations."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Which kind of makes me sad because it's like,"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"I had this wild, like, you know,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"'cause I talked to my dad and my uncles all the time"
01:32:03;01:32:04;"and they were in there in the trenches."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:32:05;01:32:08;"So it was just like, when the US occupied DR,"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"they were like, nah, fuck that."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"And they took up arms."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"So it's like, he's like,"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"that's not going to happen in America, dog."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"Like black and brown people are not going to take up arms."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"And even if they do, the guy in office right now"
01:32:19;01:32:22;"is going to massacre a mother (beep)"
01:32:22;01:32:25;"It'll be like the worst, like rebellion"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"or whatever you want to call it in history, I think."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"'Cause it's like, there's so much money invested"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"into the military and stuff like that,"
01:32:30;01:32:33;"that like, fam, the people can't fight the military."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"That's where we're at."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"- So you're saying like with your family history,"
01:32:36;01:32:40;"your parents and your uncles and stuff,"
01:32:40;01:32:41;"you're only one degree of connection away"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"from people who are actually involved in like,"
01:32:43;01:32:47;"I guess, true revolutionary arms struggle"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"against the corrupt right-wing government."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"- Yeah, man."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"- We've never seen anything really like that in the US."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Will we ever?"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"- Not even close."
01:32:56;01:32:56;"And that's what I'm saying."
01:32:56;01:32:59;"Like, I don't think we ever will because of,"
01:32:59;01:33:02;"I mean, and it's a thing, like Trump using the military"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"the way he's using it now and using the National Guard"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"the way he's using it now, that's just to quell like,"
01:33:07;01:33:10;"yo, don't try that (beep) you know what I mean?"
01:33:10;01:33:11;"That's what he's saying with that action."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"It's like, yo, you better not try that (beep)"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I see that (beep) work over there and over there,"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"it ain't gonna work over here."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"But again, like I'm not super well-versed"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"in like political (beep) like that."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"So I'm like, I don't even know,"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"like, dog, that's gotta be illegal."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"You can't use your own army to like,"
01:33:25;01:33:28;"suppress your own citizens."
01:33:28;01:33:29;"That sounds all kinds of wrong to me."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"Like, there's gotta be something that's constitutional."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"I'm like, I'm not an expert in constitutional law,"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"but I'm sure that like, there's something in there"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"that's like, you can't use the army to kill mother (beep)"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"that you don't agree with, you know what I'm saying?"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"- Although there's long history"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"standing in the National Guard to deal with riots"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"and protests and stuff."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"Well, so one thing I wanna ask you about, Mero,"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"is there's a question that always comes up"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"when there's a big moment of people"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"talking about police brutality."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"And it's an uncomfortable one because in America,"
01:33:57;01:34:00;"obviously, we're sold the kind of binary"
01:34:00;01:34:04;"of Democrats and Republicans, blue state and red state."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"We're both from New York originally, you're from the Bronx."
01:34:07;01:34:11;"We both know that New York and New York City"
01:34:11;01:34:14;"is considered the most liberal city in America, right?"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"It's the bluest of the blue."
01:34:16;01:34:16;"- Oh, yeah."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"- This is the version of New York"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"that I feel like exists in the media."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"It's like, New York is the most liberal city in the country,"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"maybe tied with San Francisco."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"It's an arts and cultural center."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"It's a melting pot full of different people."
01:34:28;01:34:30;"Are there some right wing pockets?"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Well, yeah, you got Staten Island,"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"but that's basically suburbs."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"And then in times like these,"
01:34:35;01:34:39;"you're reminded that the NYPD"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"is one of the most hated police forces in the country."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"Look at Eric Garner, sometimes the biggest,"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"these international incidents start in New York."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"So I guess my question to you"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"as somebody who grew up in New York,"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"and I've heard you tell a lot of stories"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"about your interactions with the cops over the years,"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"is in your experience growing up,"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"did the fact that you were growing up"
01:34:58;01:35:02;"in a democratic stronghold, blue city,"
01:35:02;01:35:05;"have impact on your dealings with the police?"
01:35:05;01:35:08;"Like, what do you make of that crazy inconsistency?"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"- Yeah, you hit the nail on the head."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"It's funny because people paint it that way,"
01:35:11;01:35:14;"but it's just like, bro, it's a lot of talking."
01:35:14;01:35:16;"It's a lot of rhetoric, it's a lot of bullshit."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"Like, yeah, New York is super liberal"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"and the cops are super nice and this, that, the third."
01:35:20;01:35:25;"If you live like, you know, below 96th street"
01:35:25;01:35:26;"or some (beep) like that, you know,"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"or now it's creeping up."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"So maybe now below 125th or 110th or whatever."
01:35:30;01:35:34;"But like, the (beep) juxtaposition of seeing cops"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"handing out face masks to mother (beep)"
01:35:36;01:35:38;"sunbathing in Central Park,"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"and then body slamming a dude, you know,"
01:35:41;01:35:44;"in the Bronx on the floor for not wearing a face mask,"
01:35:44;01:35:45;"those are two different New Yorks."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"That's why I tell people all the time, like,"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"yo, the New York that you see on like,"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"Sex and the City and all these shows,"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"like, that's not New York."
01:35:51;01:35:53;"Man, like, every interaction that I've ever had"
01:35:53;01:35:55;"in my entire life with a cop has been negative."
01:35:55;01:35:58;"And even when it wasn't like, crime related or anything,"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"it was like, beyond Snap or Frisk,"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"'cause that's like, I'll be on here for six hours"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"talking about all the times I got stopped at Frisk."
01:36:04;01:36:09;"But even in something as simple as like a car accident."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"So like, something in a situation where"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"I'm pulling out of a parking spot,"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"I got my blinker on, I'm totally in the right,"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"and there's somebody coming down the street"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"doing like 70 miles an hour on a local street, wiling."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"So when I'm making my turn, I get clipped."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Now you gotta call the police,"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"'cause my bumper's hanging off,"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"this lady's bumper's hanging off."
01:36:29;01:36:29;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"This is a young, smiling lady with Coke on her nose and shit."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"Like, and I'm just like, yo, you fucked up?"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"Are you skeet up right now?"
01:36:34;01:36:35;"She's like, what are you talking about?"
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Like, call the cops, blah, blah, blah."
01:36:36;01:36:41;"So the cops come, and I just like, yo, this is what happened."
01:36:41;01:36:44;"I was pulling out, I live right here across the street,"
01:36:44;01:36:45;"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
01:36:45;01:36:48;"And then I extend my hand as like a yo,"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"you know what I mean?"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Like, you got gloves on, dog."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"Like, I know you're not afraid of germs."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"I'm just trying to shake your hand and be like, yo,"
01:36:54;01:36:57;"my car is fucked up, her car is fucked up, it's over here."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"And it's just like a traffic incident."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"But the dude was just wild callous."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"And when I reached out to shake his hand, he was like,"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"verbatim, he was like, don't touch me."
01:37:04;01:37:06;"And he's like, what the fuck is going on here?"
01:37:06;01:37:07;"Like that. - Right."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"I was like, yo, this lady hit my car."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"I'm in a parking spot."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"She's skeet up."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"Like, why don't you worry about her?"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"You know what I mean?"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"And like, even--"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Was this recently?"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"This was a couple of years ago, but recent enough."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:37:18;01:37:21;"And even more recently, like, I'm on the highway,"
01:37:21;01:37:24;"and I'm switching lanes, you know what I mean?"
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Like, in Jersey, mind you."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Like, I'm switching lanes."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"But I got my blinker on, everything's copacetic."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"The speed limit is 65."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"I'm doing 75, and I get pulled over."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"The guy's like, yo, you're going 10 miles over the speed limit,"
01:37:36;01:37:37;"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
01:37:37;01:37:41;"I said, but in driving school, they teach you, you know,"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"stay 10 under, 10 over."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"Like, that's cool."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"Keep up with the flow of traffic."
01:37:45;01:37:47;"Because there's been other times when I've been pulled over"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"for going--"
01:37:49;01:37:50;"literally for going to speed limit."
01:37:50;01:37:52;"And they're like, yo, that looks suspicious."
01:37:52;01:37:54;"Because the other cars were going faster?"
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Yeah, you're doing 48 in a 50."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"I'm like, what?"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Like, you know what I'm saying?"
01:37:59;01:38:01;"So it's just like, I've literally"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"never had a positive experience with police."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"It's wild."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"And I thought that was normal."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"You know what I mean?"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Like, growing up and being insulated"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"in the Bronx like that, like, now I'm just--"
01:38:10;01:38:12;"and shout out to you for bringing me out to Cali"
01:38:12;01:38:13;"for the first time."
01:38:13;01:38:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Now I'm just exploring the world."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"Because before, it was the Bronx and Dominican Republic."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"That was my world."
01:38:18;01:38:19;"You know what I mean?"
01:38:19;01:38:23;"And as getting involved in media and TV and [BLEEP]"
01:38:23;01:38:27;"like that, entertainment, it's given me more room"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"to move around the country and see different [BLEEP]"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"and talk to different people."
01:38:30;01:38:33;"And when I tell somebody, yo, I was coming out of my crib"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"to go to the bodega that's literally around the corner,"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"and I got stopped by the police, they"
01:38:37;01:38:40;"come down the wrong way, down a one-way street,"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"just to jump out of a car and throw me up against the wall."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"And all I was doing was going to the store."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"So I'm just like, yo, what--"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"like, what are you doing?"
01:38:47;01:38:48;"And they're like, yo, do you live here?"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"I'm like, yeah, I live here."
01:38:49;01:38:50;"I'm like, my girlfriend lives here."
01:38:50;01:38:51;"My mother lives here."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"I'm-- and this is where I stay."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"But then they checked my license,"
01:38:55;01:38:56;"and my license had a different address on it."
01:38:56;01:39:00;"So now I had to walk this dude to my ex-girlfriend's door"
01:39:00;01:39:03;"to knock on the door to verify that I lived there."
01:39:03;01:39:05;"I think it's, like, important for people"
01:39:05;01:39:07;"who haven't heard these types of stories"
01:39:07;01:39:09;"or been-- obviously lived them."
01:39:09;01:39:11;"I think something happens, too, in these incidents"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"where we-- where you see a cop literally kill somebody."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"That's too far for a lot of people."
01:39:15;01:39:18;"And then a lot of people start talking about, well, yeah,"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"we got to train cops not to kill somebody."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"And of course, that's true."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"But then I'm always curious about, like,"
01:39:24;01:39:27;"stories like this, it's low level compared to death."
01:39:27;01:39:30;"But it's the type of thing that, day in, day out--"
01:39:30;01:39:30;"What happens?"
01:39:30;01:39:33;"--absolutely deeply affects the fabric of somebody's life."
01:39:33;01:39:35;"So this story that you're telling, how old were you?"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Like 17, 18."
01:39:37;01:39:38;"And that was, like, a common enough thing,"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"is, like, literally getting thrown against the wall--"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"- Oh, yeah. - --for absolutely nothing."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"Man, forget about it."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"When I was-- yo, and, like, when I was a teenager, even."
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Like, when I was a teenager, just riding around"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"in the city in the train, [BLEEP] like that,"
01:39:49;01:39:51;"doing my little graffiti thing, whatever."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"Like, in the '90s, they wouldn't even arrest you."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"They would just [BLEEP] you up or, like, do some foul [BLEEP].."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"They caught me catching a tag one time."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"And instead of taking me in, booking me,"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"handcuffing me, all that [BLEEP],,"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"they bopped me in the head with the spray can,"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"sprayed the [BLEEP] in my face, and then sprayed"
01:40:06;01:40:07;"the [BLEEP] all over my shoes."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"They spray painted your face?"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Yeah."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"So that's the type of [BLEEP] like, you know what I mean?"
01:40:12;01:40:15;"And in my head, I'm like, yo, at least I didn't go to jail."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"But at the same time, I'm like, yo, that's not cool."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"Where in the rule book is that?"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"And I had no--"
01:40:21;01:40:24;"I didn't have no, like, yo, let me get your badge number,"
01:40:24;01:40:25;"you know what I mean?"
01:40:25;01:40:28;"Or any type of, like, recourse, you know what I mean?"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"Like, there was no-- it was, yo, it is what it is."
01:40:30;01:40:31;"I thought that was normal."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"And then when you talk to other people"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"and you expand your horizons of [BLEEP],,"
01:40:35;01:40:38;"they're like, ah, fam, that is not normal at all."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Like, that's not what cops are supposed to do."
01:40:40;01:40:43;"The stories that always cause, like, the big protests"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"and stuff and the types that are finally"
01:40:45;01:40:48;"going to get across in front of the eyes of, like, you know,"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"your average suburban white middle class person,"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"they're usually going to be more extreme,"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"because they're going to involve death or something."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"And then one of the arguments you always make is, well,"
01:40:57;01:40:58;"they did break the law."
01:40:58;01:41:02;"And these stories where somebody was literally doing nothing,"
01:41:02;01:41:05;"those are the ones that are, I think--"
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Like Breonna Taylor, man."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"Like, literally, like, in her own crib."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"Yeah."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Like, that's wild, bro."
01:41:11;01:41:11;"Like, you know what I mean?"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"And, like, people talk about, yo, let's reform."
01:41:13;01:41:14;"Let's reform."
01:41:14;01:41:16;"That's like me taking a rotten apple out of the fridge"
01:41:16;01:41:18;"and being like, yo, I'm going to reform this apple."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:41:19;01:41:20;"Like, I'm going to try to cut the [BLEEP]"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"up parts out."
01:41:21;01:41:21;"You know what I mean?"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"All I'm going to be left with is, like, a leaf"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"or a stem of some [BLEEP]"
01:41:24;01:41:25;"Maybe I'm being pessimistic."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Or maybe I'm being realist."
01:41:28;01:41:28;"I don't know."
01:41:28;01:41:29;"[MUSIC - KING, ""FIRELIP""]"
01:41:29;01:41:35;"I had a dream we kissed, and it was all I resist."
01:41:35;01:41:40;"The under part of your eyes was firelip."
01:41:40;01:41:45;"You hung a cigarette between your purple lips."
01:41:45;01:41:55;"We've been by the spot since 13."
01:41:55;01:42:00;"I hold your hat back when you're too lean."
01:42:00;01:42:06;"I hold the Taco Bell, and you cry over Eugene."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"He was mean."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"Another thing that really, like, I"
01:42:08;01:42:11;"think is so disturbing about this moment"
01:42:11;01:42:16;"is that, yes, we have probably the worst president of all time,"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"absolutely one of the, like, most chaotic."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"And, you know, you see a lot of this energy, people being like,"
01:42:22;01:42:22;"that--"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"when talking about the police brutality and saying,"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"this is why we got to vote Trump out,"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"I agree, we got to vote Trump out."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"But then you sometimes get that sick feeling"
01:42:30;01:42:33;"where even me, as somebody who's never"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"had been messed with by the cops,"
01:42:35;01:42:38;"just as somebody vaguely paying attention,"
01:42:38;01:42:41;"I think back to, like, well, in my lifetime,"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"I've had about almost equal Republican presidents"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"and Democrat presidents."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"So I'm curious, were there ever notable changes"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"in your lifetime where you were like, there was a reform,"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"something did change for a second,"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"or something got worse?"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Like--"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"Hell no."
01:42:56;01:42:57;"I got older."
01:42:57;01:42:58;"That's the only thing that happened."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"I got older, and I started reading,"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"and I started saying, like, yo, you can't take me out the car."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"I didn't do anything wrong."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"You know what I mean?"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"I started, like, standing up for myself."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"And regardless, like, yo, the thing"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"is that, like, in particular, NYPD,"
01:43:10;01:43:13;"they got the mayor on smash."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"It don't matter who the mayor is."
01:43:14;01:43:15;"They got him on smash."
01:43:15;01:43:18;"The police union, the police chief, whoever the [BLEEP]"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"it is, like, they got whoever the mayor--"
01:43:20;01:43:23;"it could be mother [BLEEP] Malcolm X could be the mayor"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"of New York City, and they would have that mother [BLEEP]"
01:43:25;01:43:26;"on the front."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"That thin blue line [BLEEP] is real."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Like, those dudes don't give a [BLEEP].."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"Like, there ain't no such thing as, like, yo,"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"I'm not going to speak for all police, you know what I'm"
01:43:33;01:43:33;"saying?"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"Because there's, like-- I guess there's, like, a handful"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"out there that are like, yo, that's not me."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"More power to you."
01:43:38;01:43:42;"But if you're not saying, my man, what the [BLEEP]"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"are you doing?"
01:43:43;01:43:47;"Like, there was a thing where that got leaked over the NYPD"
01:43:47;01:43:51;"scanner where a cop was calling in, like, you know,"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"there was a protest, and they were, like, blocked in."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"All they had to do was put the car in park and just chill."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"And you still on the clock."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"You're still getting paid."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"Like, you don't get paid per arrest."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"It's not a commission thing."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"But he calls it in, boom, yadda, yadda,"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"and then two other cops come on the horn,"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"run them mother [BLEEP] and shoot them mother [BLEEP]"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"and then the other dude comes on and says--"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"I guess the commanding officer says,"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"don't say that over the air."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"Instead of saying, like, yo, who the [BLEEP] are you?"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"Turn your badge and your gun in right now."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"Yo, report back to base or precinct, whatever"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"the [BLEEP] they call it, and you're done."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"You can't say [BLEEP] like that."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"You can't even think [BLEEP] like that."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"That's the thing, though."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"Like, because there's people that are like, yo, let's"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"abolish the police completely."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"And I'm with that."
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Then there's people that's like, yo, let's reform the police."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"And I'm not with that."
01:44:30;01:44:34;"And I don't know what completely abolishing policing"
01:44:34;01:44:35;"means as a Black person."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"I'm not sure what that means."
01:44:37;01:44:42;"Somebody put forth some type of, like, plan for me to digest"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"and understand what that means."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Because it's like, yo, like I said,"
01:44:45;01:44:48;"I've never had a positive interaction with police."
01:44:48;01:44:52;"But, like, fam, if, like, somebody runs down on my sister,"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"I want to find out what happened."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"You know what I mean?"
01:44:54;01:44:57;"And, like, unfortunately, that's the resource that you have"
01:44:57;01:44:58;"is the police in a scenario like that."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Yeah, that's what we were just talking about with the Alex"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Vitale, too, is, like, the choice"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"shouldn't be between having police or living in anarchy."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Because if you're the one trying to be like, no,"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"we don't need anything, you're always"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"going to lose the debate."
01:45:10;01:45:14;"Because people, everybody, wants to feel safe."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"That's, like, a basic human right."
01:45:16;01:45:18;"If you're trying to be, like, on the right wing"
01:45:18;01:45:21;"and say, we need law and order, and the left wing is saying,"
01:45:21;01:45:22;"we don't need anything, of course"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"that's not going to work."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"But that's not what most people are saying."
01:45:25;01:45:28;"They're saying that there are problems to be solved."
01:45:28;01:45:31;"We need authorities that can help us figure out stuff."
01:45:31;01:45:32;"Something bad happens to somebody in your family,"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"something bad happens to you."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"We need those problems to be solved."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"It's just how?"
01:45:36;01:45:37;"Who do you go to?"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"And is it somebody with a gun?"
01:45:39;01:45:40;"And what department are they from?"
01:45:40;01:45:41;"And how do they work?"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"And what are the channels of justice?"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"We still need justice."
01:45:45;01:45:48;"That's the messed up part is that policing kind of seems"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"like the only way to get justice."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"And we're also talking about, like, I'm"
01:45:51;01:45:54;"sure there's a lot of cops who go into the force wanting"
01:45:54;01:45:55;"to help people."
01:45:55;01:45:55;"I believe that."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"I'm not such a pessimist that I believe"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"that millions and millions of cops only join"
01:46:00;01:46:01;"the force to beat people up."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"I don't have such a dark view of humanity or police."
01:46:04;01:46:07;"But I do know that some combination of policing"
01:46:07;01:46:11;"plus the laws create something very, very dark."
01:46:11;01:46:15;"And to me, it could be as simple as just like, yo, defund police"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"and allocate those funds elsewhere."
01:46:17;01:46:21;"So if you've got issues like domestic violence issues,"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"there's been so many times--"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"like, I lived in buildings and apartment buildings"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"or whatever where there's domestic violence."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Cops show up."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"They don't really do nothing."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"And then they leave."
01:46:30;01:46:32;"And then whoever's getting abused"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"continues to get abused, you know what I mean?"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"Until somebody from the community"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"steps in or something like that."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"So community policing is one thing."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"But it's like, is that--"
01:46:41;01:46:45;"that's not like 100% feel safe, you know what I mean?"
01:46:45;01:46:49;"But you can take that situation, like a domestic violence"
01:46:49;01:46:53;"situation, and have it be handled by social services,"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"you know what I mean?"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Something different."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"I don't even know what it is yet."
01:46:58;01:47:01;"But not just a dude showing up with a gun, like, yo,"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"get out, open the fucking door, get on the ground,"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"give me your fucking ID."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Ah!"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"It's like aggressive energy."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Yeah, and it's not easy."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"And I'm sure a lot of people are probably saying, well,"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"social work needs to be reformed too."
01:47:12;01:47:15;"I'm sure there's all sorts of problems in that world too."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"But the thing that differentiates"
01:47:16;01:47:19;"police from every other job is use of force."
01:47:19;01:47:21;"You know, people make a lot of jokes about, well,"
01:47:21;01:47:24;"if I killed someone in my job, I think"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"I'd be in a little more trouble than like two weeks,"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"you know, paid suspension."
01:47:28;01:47:30;"And people write about that, but they got to understand--"
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Yeah, hell yeah."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"--that's not just like some weird coincidence."
01:47:33;01:47:37;"There literally are laws in most states that protect police"
01:47:37;01:47:40;"because they say your job involves the use of force."
01:47:40;01:47:42;"And your job is fundamentally different"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"than other people's jobs."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"So I hope that that can be changed."
01:47:46;01:47:49;"But in the meantime, yeah, how about trying"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"to solve more problems with people whose job doesn't"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"include the use of force?"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"Because if you heard about a social worker sitting down"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"with somebody to talk about their problem in the office,"
01:47:57;01:48:00;"the next thing you know, they're like hitting them"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"or had their knee on their neck, that person would be fired"
01:48:02;01:48:05;"because it has nothing to do with the job."
01:48:05;01:48:06;"Immediately."
01:48:06;01:48:09;"But obviously, that's going to take a minute to happen."
01:48:09;01:48:13;"In the meantime, how do you feel, Merrill,"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"when you see brands making statements about Black Lives"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Matter and police brutality?"
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Does it warm your heart at all?"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Are you suspicious?"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"It's like, are you saying it just because you have to?"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Because now working in entertainment,"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"like seeing PR firms and [BLEEP] like that,"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"I know the game now."
01:48:31;01:48:34;"So it's just like, you can't just bamboozle me, Downey."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Or, you know what I'm saying, no shots at Downey."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:48:37;01:48:40;"I don't know if Downey made it--"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"wait, Seinfeld, can you check if Downey made a statement?"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"Yeah, I'll look into it."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Yeah, let's see if Downey-- because Downey"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"had the cute bear, Snuggles."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"Is that what he's called? - The bear, yeah."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"Yeah, the Snuggle bear."
01:48:49;01:48:52;"Snuggle's been a little bit too quiet for my taste."
01:48:52;01:48:53;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"I want to know how my fabric softener"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"feels about this crisis."
01:48:56;01:48:57;"And that's the dumb [BLEEP]"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"It's like, OK, I understand what you're trying to do,"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"but it's just so goofy."
01:49:02;01:49:08;"I feel like most of these kind of like slogans and like,"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"you know, initiatives or whatever"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"that are thought up in like these boardrooms"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"are just goofy."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"When you can just go out and just talk to the people"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"and be like, yo, what do you need?"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"How can we do better?"
01:49:17;01:49:18;"You know what I mean?"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"Get on the ground, bro."
01:49:19;01:49:23;"Downey did make a statement a couple of days ago."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Yeah, what did they say?"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"We don't want to be soft."
01:49:26;01:49:31;"They said, equality, justice, action now."
01:49:31;01:49:35;"We stand with those fighting for equality and #justice."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"We're joining the Procter & Gamble family of brands"
01:49:38;01:49:42;"to commit $5 million to #takeonrace,"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"a fund supporting organizations fighting"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"systemic bias and inequality."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"And then they have like a very solemn like four panel"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"thing that says equality, justice, action now."
01:49:52;01:49:53;"No bear?"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"Yeah, was the bear--"
01:49:54;01:49:55;"No snuggle."
01:49:55;01:49:57;"No snuggle with like the fist."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"No snuggle with the raised fist."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Snuggle--"
01:50:00;01:50:01;"There you go, brown erasure."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Brown erasure."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"Yeah, they wouldn't let snuggle get back in."
01:50:05;01:50:08;"I mean, when you talked about the millions of dollars"
01:50:08;01:50:11;"that Procter & Gamble's giving, $5 million from Downey,"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"that'd be significant."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"From the whole Procter & Gamble family,"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"that's a drop in the bucket."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"But before that, it was all kind of like,"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"it's a weird feeling when you see so many people"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"on the internet talking about taking action."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"Like we've all had this experience"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"where you know you're in the hall of mirrors"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"where it's like everybody's like,"
01:50:27;01:50:31;"especially white people calling each other out saying like,"
01:50:31;01:50:32;"we need to do take more action."
01:50:32;01:50:35;"And we need to talk about take more, it's like, I agree."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"We absolutely need to take more action."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"And the first step to taking action is listening."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"And you're like, you just know that it's like,"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"it's all just talking about taking action."
01:50:43;01:50:44;"It's no action."
01:50:44;01:50:46;"And again, I'm not like,"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"I'm a little bit on some Anne Frank (beep)"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"I do believe that there's good in all people."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"Let's say most people, I do believe it."
01:50:52;01:50:57;"But I also believe that the world is so chaotic and confusing"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"that well-meaning people do the opposite"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"of what they think they're doing every day."
01:51:02;01:51:06;"I think there's all sorts of people who mean well,"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"white people calling each other out"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"and talking about action, they mean well,"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"but they just don't know what real action would be"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"because very few people do."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"There's something like really,"
01:51:15;01:51:18;"even now we're talking about there's all these responses"
01:51:18;01:51:19;"that well, how do you reform the police?"
01:51:19;01:51:22;"And clearly some ideas are better than others,"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"but we don't know which one's gonna win."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"But anyway, I'm curious about when you hear this language"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"of like Downy Fabric Softener,"
01:51:28;01:51:32;"even just saying that is just like unreal."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"That was a good call, Mero."
01:51:34;01:51:35;"What does Downy have to say?"
01:51:35;01:51:38;"But even Downy Fabric Softener,"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"talking about action and justice,"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"I'm willing to believe there's many people"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"in the Downy organization who don't believe"
01:51:44;01:51:48;"that black people should be treated as subhumans"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"and brutalized by the police."
01:51:49;01:51:52;"I believe that there's people in the Downy organization"
01:51:52;01:51:53;"believe that in this money,"
01:51:53;01:51:56;"I believe that there's some good behind it."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"- It's also a gigantic tax write-off."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"- Oh, right, yeah, that's true."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"(laughing)"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"- You know what I'm saying?"
01:52:01;01:52:02;"- It's a tax write-off."
01:52:02;01:52:03;"- It's PR and a tax write-off."
01:52:03;01:52:05;"- I'm kind of pessimistic, but not so much."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"Obviously there has to be good people in the world,"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"or else we would all be dead."
01:52:09;01:52:09;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"- Yeah. - You know who did,"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"I'm not gonna go out front,"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"I read one, I think it was Ben and Jerry's."
01:52:15;01:52:15;"- I was gonna, yeah."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"- They did a rap. - We were gonna talk"
01:52:16;01:52:18;"about them, this is the actual text."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"""The murder of George Floyd was the result"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"""of inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"""by a culture of white supremacy."""
01:52:25;01:52:26;"And they include an image that said,"
01:52:26;01:52:29;"""We must dismantle white supremacy."""
01:52:29;01:52:31;"Now, I do love Ben and Jerry's."
01:52:31;01:52:34;"We gotta talk about the Chunky Dunkys at some point,"
01:52:34;01:52:38;"but it's a really big month for Ben and Jerry's."
01:52:38;01:52:40;"- The worst sneaker of the year."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"- Well, it's the hottest sneaker of the year too,"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"but Ben and Jerry's, first of all,"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"I've met Ben and Jerry when we were doing"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"some campaigning for Bernie."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"So I'll always respect Ben and Jerry,"
01:52:50;01:52:53;"because I can't think of too many other people like that,"
01:52:53;01:52:56;"just people who made a lot of money"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"with a corporate product,"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"or out there campaigning for Bernie Sanders."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"So I respect them."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"I know that they don't fully control the company anymore,"
01:53:04;01:53:07;"and I know they come from Burlington, Vermont,"
01:53:07;01:53:08;"crunchy left-wing background."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"I like all of that."
01:53:10;01:53:12;"The only thing I'll say though, is like,"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"okay, here's my pessimistic take,"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"and then I hope someone can convince me"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"not to be this pessimistic."
01:53:17;01:53:17;"- Let's go."
01:53:17;01:53:20;"- The idea that Downey Fabric Softener"
01:53:20;01:53:23;"would be putting out a statement that says,"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"we need to tackle racial inequality,"
01:53:25;01:53:28;"and we need racial justice in this country."
01:53:28;01:53:32;"Imagine if somebody told you that in the '80s."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"You're just watching Snuggles the Bear on a commercial,"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"just trying to, and then you're like,"
01:53:37;01:53:38;"you know what, in the future one day,"
01:53:38;01:53:41;"this same company that right now is just like a bear going,"
01:53:41;01:53:43;"it's so soft."
01:53:43;01:53:47;"One day this company, they'll be making a statement"
01:53:47;01:53:51;"on the social media platform about ending racism."
01:53:51;01:53:54;"You'd be like, uh, doubt it."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"'Cause at that moment, for a fabric softener"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"to even talk about racism,"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"would have been seen as kind of crazy, controversial,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"whatever, 30 years ago."
01:54:03;01:54:06;"So my fear is that there's something about the language"
01:54:06;01:54:10;"of marketing and social media that,"
01:54:10;01:54:11;"you know, it's like the same way that people say"
01:54:11;01:54:16;"that capitalism can absorb any critique of it."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"One day Che Guevara's fighting capitalism,"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"next day he's being sold on a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"You know, this is, tale as old as time."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"I guess sometimes my pessimistic side is like,"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"well, yeah, Ben and Jerry's is ahead of the curve,"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"'cause it's like a cooler company,"
01:54:29;01:54:33;"but maybe in another 10 years, nothing will change,"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"but in 10 years, you might get,"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"now Downey is gonna be tweeting"
01:54:37;01:54:40;"about using the phrase white supremacy,"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"and Ben and Jerry's will be full on"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"just like writing, ""(beep) the police."""
01:54:43;01:54:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:54:44;01:54:45;"(laughing)"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- Yo, I feel you."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"And that's a take that I have not heard,"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"and that makes perfect sense,"
01:54:49;01:54:52;"and it's one million percent logical."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"And like, yo, it's marketing."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"It might've been them sitting back and being like,"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"all right, let's wait and see what everybody else says,"
01:54:58;01:55:01;"and everybody else's reactions to this (beep), right?"
01:55:01;01:55:02;"And then they see that everybody else,"
01:55:02;01:55:06;"like Downey and whoever else is using like soft language,"
01:55:06;01:55:07;"no pun intended, like,"
01:55:07;01:55:08;"(laughing)"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"and injustice, you know what I mean?"
01:55:10;01:55:13;"Instead of saying like, yo, black lives matter,"
01:55:13;01:55:14;"white supremacy, you know what I mean?"
01:55:14;01:55:15;"Like, that's the thing."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"You might be ahead of the curve right now,"
01:55:17;01:55:18;"'cause you might've, like,"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"they might've had their people sitting in the back room"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"being like, yo, hold up, chill, chill, chill."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Before we release our statements,"
01:55:23;01:55:26;"let's let these mother(beep) release their statements first,"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"and let's see what the reaction is"
01:55:28;01:55:29;"before we release ours."
01:55:29;01:55:30;"- Right."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"- A lot of the blowback was like,"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"yo, it's white supremacy,"
01:55:32;01:55:35;"say black lives matter, say this, use this language."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"- I know, and that's the tough thing,"
01:55:37;01:55:40;"is like, people mean well when they criticize"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"corporate language and social media language"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"by saying, say the word, you know?"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"Like, talking about it for real, but-"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"- Bro, chill, I don't wanna cut you off,"
01:55:48;01:55:51;"but you really said, finish everything, (beep) the police."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"(laughing)"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"- I mean, that's almost just too dark,"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"but it's like, I was-"
01:55:55;01:55:56;"- I'm not saying finish,"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"I'm saying before, just like-"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"- I'm not saying finish, I'm saying before, just like-"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"(laughing)"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"- Well, no, I feel like actually,"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"wasn't there a viral tweet where somebody,"
01:56:03;01:56:04;"no, no, actually, now that I think about it,"
01:56:04;01:56:07;"there was a tweet where somebody literally was being like,"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"all these other brands are being soft,"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"Ben & Jerry's, meanwhile, is basically like,"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"(beep) the police, that is our new flavor"
01:56:13;01:56:15;"and has blueberries, that was a viral tweet, actually."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"Obviously, it's funny, but it's like,"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"they're almost giving them too much credit, you know?"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"And again, I like Ben & Jerry's as a company,"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"but when you're one step ahead,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"it's like with fashion or music,"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"all you have to be is one step ahead,"
01:56:27;01:56:30;"and suddenly you seem like the crazy visionary,"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"but it doesn't mean that you're, it's all relative, right?"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"And although, the one thing I'll say is,"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"I do kind of, now that I'm talking about this,"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I kind of remember Ben & Jerry's actually posting"
01:56:39;01:56:44;"something a while back about why weed should be legal"
01:56:44;01:56:47;"and why it's so messed up that black people"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"are targeted for weed possession."
01:56:48;01:56:50;"Didn't they do something like that?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- They had a blog post called,"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"""Let's Be Blunt About Cannabis."""
01:56:53;01:56:56;"That was actually on 4/20 of this year."
01:56:56;01:56:57;"- And if Ben & Jerry's is actually giving money"
01:56:57;01:57:00;"towards legalizing weed or something,"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"that's light years ahead of brands"
01:57:01;01:57:05;"who are just trying to have conversations."
01:57:05;01:57:08;"And yeah, our executive board sat down"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"with some activists to chat."
01:57:10;01:57:11;"If you're actually being like,"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"""We're not just talking about the problem."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"""We're trying to get to the bottom of it,"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"""and we're looking at,"""
01:57:16;01:57:18;"we were talking about this a lot earlier in the show, Mero,"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"is just the extent to which the war on drugs"
01:57:21;01:57:25;"is so obviously linked to policing and police brutality,"
01:57:25;01:57:28;"and yet there's still this tendency to talk about them"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"as two separate things, where it's kind of like,"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"""Well, I don't know if I think weed should be,"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"""if we should legalize drugs,"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"""but I do think cops should chill out."""

01:57:39;01:57:40;"Well, actually, I'm curious, in your own experience,"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"what was the link between times"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"when you were just randomly harassed?"
01:57:44;01:57:47;"How many times did it have to do with"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"the quote-unquote search for illegal drugs?"
01:57:49;01:57:50;"Yeah."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"- Oh, with me, it was always drugs and guns."
01:57:52;01:57:56;"Weirdly, any time I got pulled over under an elevated train,"
01:57:56;01:57:59;"like the four train and six train, five, two, five,"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"any time I got pulled over under one of those trains,"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"they would always pull me over and be like,"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"""Yo, make up a bull(beep) reason,"""

01:58:08;01:58:09;"""All right."""
01:58:09;01:58:11;"First, they would ask me straight up,"

01:58:12;01:58:13;"And I'd be like, ""No!"

01:59:29;01:59:31;"Gets on the horn, we had a TOS,"
01:59:31;01:59:32;"(mimics horn)"
01:59:32;01:59:32;"yada, yada, yada, yada."
01:59:32;01:59:34;"- Wait, wait, sorry, what does TOS stand for?"
01:59:34;01:59:35;"- Deft of service."
01:59:35;01:59:38;"So like, hopping a train, hopping a bus."
01:59:38;01:59:38;"- You stole a ride."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"- I stole a ride."
01:59:39;01:59:40;"- You stole a ride."
01:59:40;01:59:43;"- So I stole a $1.50 ride,"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"so you had to pull me out of the bus,"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"inconvenience the entire bus full of people,"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"'cause, you know what I'm saying?"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"This was Burnside and Jerome Avenue."
01:59:50;01:59:51;"Everybody there's working class,"
01:59:51;01:59:52;"there's no rich people over there."
01:59:52;01:59:55;"So, you inconvenience this whole bus full of people"
01:59:55;01:59:58;"going to school, work, wherever the (beep) they were going,"
01:59:58;01:59:59;"just to pull me off."
01:59:59;02:00:00;"I have money on my MetroCard,"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"I'm telling you that I'm paying my,"
02:00:02;02:00:03;"that I'm going to go pay my fare."
02:00:03;02:00:05;"But regardless of that, you just want to hem me up,"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"throw me up against the gate, (beep) up my white tee,"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"'cause he threw me up against the rolled down gate"
02:00:09;02:00:10;"that was all dusty and dirty,"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"and (beep) my whole day up."
02:00:12;02:00:14;"Took me in, booked me, and I didn't even,"
02:00:14;02:00:15;"they didn't even book me,"
02:00:15;02:00:18;"they took me to the precinct and just had me sit there,"
02:00:18;02:00:19;"like an ass (beep), you know what I'm saying?"
02:00:19;02:00:21;"And I guess they realized like,"
02:00:21;02:00:23;"yo, there's no, I don't want to do paperwork,"
02:00:23;02:00:24;"or I don't want to do whatever the (beep)"
02:00:24;02:00:26;"and they're like, yo, get the (beep) out of here."
02:00:26;02:00:27;"This is wild, bro."
02:00:27;02:00:29;"It's very loosey goosey, like how they do (beep)."
02:00:29;02:00:31;"- These are the type of stories that like,"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"you sometimes get worried about,"
02:00:33;02:00:36;"like for the type of people who only get off the couch"
02:00:36;02:00:41;"for police brutality, like police murder, so to speak,"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"like a story like yours."
02:00:43;02:00:44;"- They're like, ah, whatever."
02:00:44;02:00:46;"- Well, it's also just like,"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"that kind of stuff is happening every day,"
02:00:48;02:00:50;"and also just like the idea that,"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"yeah, that the cop is even in charge of that."
02:00:52;02:00:54;"Like the same cop who's like,"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"maybe dealing with theft and murder"
02:00:56;02:01:00;"is also in charge of making sure that a kid pays their,"
02:01:00;02:01:01;"swipes their card."
02:01:01;02:01:04;"Like, you know, you could even hire,"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"put somebody on the street at the same salary and be like,"
02:01:06;02:01:10;"hey, if you ever see somebody, give them a ticket."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"- And that's the thing too, like,"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"now I have the knowledge to know like,"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"fam, you're not supposed to take the entrance."
02:01:16;02:01:18;"You're supposed to write me a DAT,"
02:01:18;02:01:21;"a death comparison ticket and keep it moving."
02:01:21;02:01:21;"You know what I mean?"
02:01:21;02:01:22;"'Cause you're supposed to be, like you said,"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"fighting real crime."
02:01:24;02:01:24;"Like, you know what I mean?"
02:01:24;02:01:25;"Like if some mother (beep)"
02:01:25;02:01:27;"getting stabbed to death down the street"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"and you over here wasting your time on me,"
02:01:29;02:01:31;"writing me a ticket and asking me my address"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"and all this bull (beep)"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"'cause I got on the back of the bus"
02:01:33;02:01:35;"instead of the front of the bus,"
02:01:35;02:01:37;"that whole system is (beep) up."
02:01:37;02:01:39;"- Yeah, it's dark, but I mean,"
02:01:39;02:01:40;"people are paying attention,"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"so maybe people will finally pay attention"
02:01:42;02:01:45;"to some of the underlying issues."
02:01:45;02:01:47;"- Yeah, but you know what?"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"Shout out to Downy."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"(laughing)"
02:01:49;02:01:50;"- Well, we got Downy on the case."
02:01:50;02:01:51;"That's a good one."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"And shout out to Ben and Jerry's."
02:01:53;02:01:54;"You like Ben and Jerry's?"
02:01:54;02:01:55;"- Like, I'm highly lactose intolerant,"
02:01:55;02:01:57;"so I punish my intestines every time I do it,"
02:01:57;02:02:00;"but I (beep) with it hard, bro."
02:02:00;02:02:02;"Like that fish food, woo!"
02:02:02;02:02:03;"That (beep) is different."
02:02:03;02:02:05;"And now they're doing the core (beep)"
02:02:05;02:02:06;"and it's like they know that their core audience"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"is like mother (beep) that smoke bad weed."
02:02:08;02:02:10;"'Cause like I used to like eat the middle"
02:02:10;02:02:11;"out of the Ben and Jerry's anyway"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"and fill it up with other (beep)"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"like Sunday syrup and like cereal"
02:02:15;02:02:17;"and all types of wild--"
02:02:17;02:02:18;"- That reminds me, I can't remember if this is a tweet"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"or something you said to me once,"
02:02:20;02:02:23;"but you were like, more of these like snack companies"
02:02:23;02:02:26;"should hire like super stoners for their R&D department."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"- Yeah, yes, exactly."
02:02:27;02:02:29;"- Because I think your joke was just like"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"the kind of creative (beep) that you come up with"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"late night in the kitchen,"
02:02:33;02:02:36;"be like, just like super baked, is next level."
02:02:36;02:02:37;"- You know what I'm saying?"
02:02:37;02:02:40;"Who knew using Eggo waffles as bread"
02:02:40;02:02:44;"for a Goober grape sandwich is delicious."
02:02:44;02:02:46;"It's crispy, it's soft, it's delicious, try it."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"- Mix and stuff with ice cream, very smart."
02:02:49;02:02:49;"- Hashtag Ed."
02:02:49;02:02:50;"- Hashtag Ed."
02:02:50;02:02:52;"All right, good talking to you, Merrill."

02:03:40;02:03:42;"I hope in our conversation with, you know,"
02:03:42;02:03:47;"we've got the kind of academic side from Professor Vitale,"
02:03:47;02:03:50;"got Merrill, somebody actually, you know,"

02:03:56;02:03:58;"we might have some random right-wingers"
02:03:58;02:04:02;"who are just like never gonna be open to these conversations"
02:04:02;02:04:03;"on some like weird All Lives Matter thing,"
02:04:03;02:04:06;"but I just hope that for the rest of us,"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"I just like hope we keep getting to the root of it."
02:04:08;02:04:09;"That's my biggest fear,"
02:04:09;02:04:12;"is just that people will continue to suffer."
02:04:12;02:04:16;"And even this moment that feels unprecedented"
02:04:16;02:04:19;"will then just turn out to be just another one,"
02:04:19;02:04:21;"just like these other moments seemed unprecedented"
02:04:21;02:04:26;"in the late '60s, the Rodney King riots in the early '90s."
02:04:26;02:04:28;"That seemed like a moment where the mask was coming off,"
02:04:28;02:04:31;"the inequality was too great, the injustice was too great."
02:04:31;02:04:36;"And yet somehow even that anger was subdued and controlled"
02:04:38;02:04:39;"and didn't change things."
02:04:39;02:04:42;"So I hope for especially people with privilege"
02:04:42;02:04:45;"who can actually influence policy and stuff,"
02:04:45;02:04:48;"like you said, it's really great"
02:04:48;02:04:50;"that people are in the streets and posting"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"and talking with family members, that's all important,"
02:04:52;02:04:54;"but these budget meeting stuff,"
02:04:54;02:04:56;"that kind of like dry budget meeting stuff,"
02:04:56;02:04:58;"that feels like very important."
02:04:58;02:05:02;"Anyway, everybody just keep thinking, keep learning,"
02:05:02;02:05:03;"keep researching."
02:05:04;02:05:08;"Time crisis, for now it's gonna go back to bi-weekly."
02:05:08;02:05:11;"Maybe we can find out some ways to have some fun"
02:05:11;02:05:13;"in the bi-week still."
02:05:13;02:05:15;"Maybe me and Jake jump on Instagram live."
02:05:15;02:05:18;"I don't know, we'll figure something out."
02:05:18;02:05:19;"But keep your eyes peeled,"
02:05:19;02:05:22;"'cause we're gonna throw up the lost episode sometime"
02:05:22;02:05:25;"in the next week and it's fun."
02:05:25;02:05:26;"We're talking Chunky Dunkies,"
02:05:26;02:05:31;"we got a nice call in from a friend of the show, Jonah Hill."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"It was a strong episode."
02:05:33;02:05:35;"- Also had a call in from Aaron Olson."
02:05:35;02:05:38;"- Oh, that's right, we talked with LA Takedown,"
02:05:38;02:05:40;"had a great conversation."
02:05:40;02:05:43;"So anyway, hope everybody's staying safe,"
02:05:43;02:05:46;"people who are out there protesting especially,"
02:05:46;02:05:48;"be safe in many ways."
