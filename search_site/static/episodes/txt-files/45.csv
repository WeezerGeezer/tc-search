00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"I'm rejoined by my good friend Jake,"
00:06;00:09;"who's been on a wedding tour across America."
00:09;00:14;"We'll be talking about the last stand of Belgium's Wendy's,"
00:14;00:16;"and not the Wendy's you think."
00:16;00:19;"We'll also be joined by Kazzy David"
00:19;00:22;"to discuss clubbing,"
00:22;00:24;"Niall Horan,"
00:24;00:26;"and Seinfeld trivia."
00:26;00:29;"All this on a very special..."
00:29;00:33;"Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:33;00:35;"B-B-B-Beast..."
00:35;00:37;"One."
00:37;00:40;"# They passed me by"
00:40;00:43;"# All of those great romances"
00:43;00:47;"# They were a wealth of a belief"
00:47;00:50;"# All my rightful chances"
00:50;00:53;"# My picture clear"
00:53;00:58;"# Everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:02;"# And so I dealt to the blow"
01:02;01:05;"# One of us had to go"
01:05;01:07;"# Now it's different"
01:07;01:10;"# I want you to know"
01:10;01:13;"# One of us is crying"
01:13;01:16;"# One of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"# Leave a lonely way... #"
01:20;01:24;"Time Crisis, Los Angeles, California."
01:24;01:26;"What's up, Jake?"
01:26;01:28;"It's June 2017."
01:28;01:30;"That's right. Deep in 2017 now."
01:30;01:32;"- Jeez. - Almost halfway done."
01:32;01:34;"I know it's a cliche, but the year is flying by."
01:34;01:36;"It's good to see you, Jake."
01:36;01:38;"You've been on the road a lot lately, man."
01:38;01:40;"I feel like you're on a wedding tour."
01:40;01:41;"It's true."
01:41;01:44;"I'm getting texts from you, seeing Instagrams,"
01:44;01:46;"where I'm just trying to figure out where you are."
01:46;01:49;"You know when you see a picture of some random bus,"
01:49;01:51;"and you're just like, ""Where is that?"""
01:51;01:53;"I know that's not an LA bus, not a New York bus."
01:53;01:55;"Or just a weird pizza hut,"
01:55;01:58;"and then the location on my gram just says, like,"
01:58;02:00;"Pineville, Minnesota."
02:00;02:04;"Like a weird CVS in suburban Minneapolis."
02:04;02:06;"So what's going on? I guess it's springtime."
02:06;02:09;"- It's wedding season. - I've been to two weddings"
02:09;02:12;"far from LA in the last three weeks."
02:12;02:15;"But the good news is I'm done for the summer. That's it."
02:15;02:17;"- Oh, really? You banged it out? - Yeah, banged it out."
02:17;02:21;"Yeah, 'cause some people got, like, seven, eight weddings a season."
02:21;02:23;"- That's insane. That's crazy. - So both of these people"
02:23;02:25;"- were your girlfriend's friends? - Yeah."
02:25;02:27;"Last weekend was DC, and then two weekends before that,"
02:27;02:30;"Memorial Day weekend, was Minneapolis."
02:30;02:32;"You came in today wearing a T-shirt,"
02:32;02:34;"which I believe is from the same Minnesota trip"
02:34;02:36;"that you were just waiting for."
02:36;02:38;"It says ""Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar."""
02:38;02:41;"It looks kind of like an early '70s logo."
02:41;02:45;"There's an anthropomorphized female cookie,"
02:45;02:48;"or at least-- we don't know if the cookie's female,"
02:48;02:50;"- but this cookie-- - No, definitely a female cookie."
02:50;02:52;"Well, it's probably what they wanted to imply."
02:52;02:54;"The cookie has kind of, like, lipstick on and high heels,"
02:54;02:56;"- but, you know-- - Eyelashes."
02:56;02:58;"They're going for, like, a Minnie Mouse look on this cookie."
02:58;03:01;"What is Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar?"
03:01;03:04;"Okay, well, this is something I learned about on my trip to Minnesota."
03:04;03:09;"The Minnesota State Fair occurs the final two weeks of August of every year,"
03:09;03:12;"and it's the second largest state fair in the country,"
03:12;03:14;"so it's a big deal."
03:14;03:17;"Like, a family friend of Hannah's"
03:17;03:21;"runs this business called Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar,"
03:21;03:26;"and so at the fairgrounds, there's a giant cookie stand"
03:26;03:28;"that sells cookies in buckets."
03:28;03:33;"So, like, you buy, like, four dozen chocolate chip cookies in a bucket"
03:33;03:36;"- for, like, $17 or something. - So you can't buy a single cookie?"
03:36;03:38;"- I think you can, but here's the thing. - Yeah."
03:38;03:41;"It's a very popular item at the fair,"
03:41;03:43;"and people wait in line for hours."
03:43;03:49;"And I saw aerial photographs of zombie hordes"
03:49;03:51;"trying to get to the cookie stand."
03:51;03:54;"People wait in line at the Minnesota State Fair to get--"
03:54;03:58;"Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar chocolate chip cookies. That's all they sell."
03:58;04:01;"Because Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar, there's no brick-and-mortar retail establishment?"
04:01;04:04;"Nope. They sell this cookie-- Okay, they sell these cookies"
04:04;04:10;"only 12 days a year at the Minnesota State Fair,"
04:10;04:14;"and this operation is so successful and legendary within the state of Minnesota"
04:14;04:16;"that that's their yearly income."
04:16;04:17;"- That's so crazy. - Yeah."
04:17;04:22;"They make a good living every year selling cookies 12 days a year."
04:22;04:27;"Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar only exists at the Minnesota State Fair"
04:27;04:29;"once a year for 12 days."
04:29;04:31;"- They're covering their yearly income. - Yep."
04:31;04:34;"Colin just showed me an article on his phone,"
04:34;04:36;"and I didn't want to speculate on their income"
04:36;04:38;"because I knew the business did well."
04:38;04:41;"But this article the Hebrews brought up said that they make $3 million annually"
04:41;04:46;"selling cookies. Now, I know that they have 600 employees working the fair."
04:46;04:49;"- I don't know what their overhead is. - But that's for 12 days."
04:49;04:54;"- That's insane. - They're probably paying college students $7.50 an hour."
04:54;04:58;"So I know people that-- Oh, this dude Sean that I met,"
04:58;05:00;"his girlfriend--"
05:00;05:02;"- Had worked at the fair? - No, no, no."
05:02;05:04;"His girlfriend's mom is Martha."
05:04;05:05;"- Is Sweet Martha-- - Sorry to cut to the chase."
05:05;05:08;"- Wait, so did you meet Sweet Martha? - Oh, yeah. I went out-- Okay."
05:08;05:11;"Okay. Full disclosure. I went out to their lake house."
05:11;05:13;"- You went to Sweet Martha's lake house? - Yes, I did."
05:13;05:15;"That's where I met her and her husband."
05:15;05:18;"- I mean, it must have been a sick lake house. - Yeah, it was amazing."
05:18;05:20;"- Yeah. - And then we just rolled in blind."
05:20;05:23;"I didn't know anything. I didn't know anyone there."
05:23;05:26;"- Just eating caviar for breakfast. - Yeah, exactly."
05:26;05:30;"Slowly this story emerges about Sweet Martha's and the cookies."
05:30;05:33;"And I'm like, ""Okay, they have a cookie franchise."
05:33;05:37;"I'm sure they have outlets, locations, and various strip malls"
05:37;05:40;"around the greater Twin Cities."""
05:40;05:43;"Not the case. 12 days a year."
05:43;05:46;"- And so-- And actually-- Okay. - Dad's like,"
05:46;05:49;"""Jake, have you ever seen $3 million in cash?"""
05:49;05:51;"Like, ""No, sir."" Like, come down to the basement."
05:51;05:54;"- Yeah, seriously. - This is still from 2012."
05:54;05:57;"I haven't even had time to deposit this."
05:57;05:59;"Okay, well, check this out, dude."
05:59;06:03;"So there's the 12 days a year, but if there's a big event"
06:03;06:07;"at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, they will open up for a day."
06:07;06:11;"Now, the Saturday that we were there for the wedding,"
06:11;06:15;"during the day, there was a hip-hop festival curated by this guy, Atmosphere,"
06:15;06:18;"who's like a local Minnesota rapper."
06:18;06:20;"And he had put together a big hip-hop festival,"
06:20;06:23;"and so Sweet Martha's was open for the afternoon."
06:23;06:27;"So we went over to the fairgrounds and got a tour of the full facilities."
06:27;06:30;"- Is it a permanent structure? - Oh, yeah."
06:30;06:32;"- Major, major infrastructure. - You know what?"
06:32;06:35;"- Major investment went into this. - It's like the Venice Biennale."
06:35;06:37;"- Kind of. - 'Cause there they have, like,"
06:37;06:39;"- every country has their pavilion. - Sure."
06:39;06:42;"Which, you know, it's really every two years."
06:42;06:45;"So for the vast majority of the time, they build these big permanent structures"
06:45;06:47;"that I'm sure they do other stuff in between,"
06:47;06:50;"but really, it's there for every two years."
06:50;06:52;"- Yeah. - And this is every one year."
06:52;06:54;"So did you see a lot of, like, Atmosphere fans"
06:54;06:57;"schlepping around a giant bucket of cookies?"
06:57;06:59;"- Yep. - Just, like, in the crowd,"
06:59;07:03;"- everybody was holding it? - Yeah, everyone was hitting Sweet Martha's."
07:03;07:07;"According to Google, there's only 90 calories in a Sweet Martha's cookie."
07:07;07:10;"- Well, they're small. They're small. - Okay."
07:10;07:12;"- And did you-- So you ate one? - Oh, yeah."
07:12;07:15;"- Probably ate, like, six. - I mean, when in Rome."
07:15;07:18;"I wanted to make a song about where I'm from, you know?"
07:18;07:21;"Big up my hometown, my territory, my state"
07:21;07:24;"But I couldn't figure out much to brag about"
07:24;07:27;"Well, Prince lives here, we got 10,000 legs"
07:27;07:29;"But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are"
07:29;07:32;"And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars"
07:32;07:35;"And it hit me, hit me, Minnesota is dope"
07:35;07:38;"If only simply, for not what we have, but what we don't"
07:38;07:41;"It's all there, it ain't out there, it's in there"
07:41;07:44;"It's in the mirror, behind the breast, under the hair"
07:44;07:47;"Follow the dream, doesn't mean leave the love"
07:47;07:50;"Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough"
07:50;07:53;"I love New York and Cali, but I ain't moved"
07:53;07:56;"Too overpopulated, saturated with humans"
07:56;07:58;"And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models"
07:58;08:01;"If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago"
08:01;08:04;"None of this is to diss no one, nowhere"
08:04;08:07;"Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air"
08:07;08:10;"Too many mosquitoes and a fair share of egos"
08:10;08:13;"But like my man Sabi says, that's where my money stands"
08:13;08:15;"So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell 'em where you live"
08:15;08:18;"Say, say"
08:18;08:21;"And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids"
08:21;08:24;"Say, say"
08:24;08:27;"If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where"
08:27;08:30;"Say, say"
08:30;08:33;"If you can drink tap water and breathe the air"
08:33;08:36;"Say, say"
08:36;08:38;"Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay"
08:38;08:42;"The rent's in the mail, and I can't always find a parking space"
08:42;08:44;"The women outnumber the men two to one"
08:44;08:47;"Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son"
08:47;08:50;"The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay"
08:50;08:53;"I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day"
08:53;08:55;"And the jobs ain't really too hard to find"
08:55;08:59;"In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme"
08:59;09:01;"This is for everyone around the planet"
09:01;09:04;"That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they're standing"
09:04;09:07;"Don't take it for granted, instead, take a look around"
09:07;09:10;"Quit complaining and build something on that ground"
09:10;09:12;"Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground"
09:12;09:15;"Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around the ground"
09:15;09:18;"Make a family, make magic, make a mess"
09:18;09:21;"Take the stress, fuel your motivation, and build your nest"
09:21;09:24;"It sucks that you think where I'm from is whack"
09:24;09:27;"But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back"
09:27;09:29;"And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said"
09:29;09:32;"I beg your pardon, but this is my secret garden"
09:32;09:33;"Alright"
09:33;09:41;"(Middle of the land of ice and snow)"
09:41;09:43;"(Middle of the land of ice and snow)"
09:43;09:47;"So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell 'em where you live, say"
09:47;09:49;"Say"
09:49;09:53;"If you know this is where you wanna raise your kids, say"
09:53;09:55;"Say"
09:55;09:59;"If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where, say"
09:59;10:01;"Say"
10:01;10:05;"If you can drink tap water and breathe the air, say"
10:05;10:07;"Say"
10:07;10:11;"If the playground is clear of stems and syringes, say"
10:11;10:12;"Say"
10:12;10:16;"If there's only one store in your town that sells 12 inches, say"
10:16;10:18;"Say"
10:18;10:22;"If no one in your crew walks around with a gun, say"
10:22;10:24;"Say"
10:24;10:28;"And if you ain't gonna leave 'cause this is where you're from, say"
10:28;10:30;"Say"
10:30;10:33;"St. Cloud, Minnesota"
10:33;10:36;"Mankato, Minnesota"
10:36;10:39;"Duluth, Minnesota"
10:39;10:42;"Kansas City"
10:42;10:45;"St. Louis, Missouri"
10:45;10:48;"Columbia, Missouri"
10:48;10:50;"Oshkosh, Wisconsin"
10:50;10:53;"Madison, Milwaukee"
10:53;10:56;"Cincinnati, Ohio"
10:56;10:59;"Columbus, Ohio"
10:59;11:02;"Bolo, Colorado"
11:02;11:05;"Lawrence, Kansas"
11:05;11:08;"Tulsa, Oklahoma"
11:08;11:11;"Sioux Falls, South Dakota"
11:11;11:13;"Ann Arbor, Michigan"
11:13;11:16;"Indianapolis, say"
11:16;11:20;"You know, I've always hated Otis Spunkmeyer. It's just one of those brands that rub me the wrong way."
11:20;11:25;"I think I've talked about this on the show. If I haven't, I'm glad we're talking about it now."
11:25;11:30;"I just remember being a kid, and at my school, they had grandma's cookies."
11:30;11:32;"Grandma's sucks too."
11:32;11:37;"Yeah, those suck too. But then they would have these greasy, hot Otis Spunkmeyer cookies."
11:37;11:41;"I always just felt like I don't like the name Otis Spunkmeyer. I think that that's..."
11:41;11:43;"That's a terrible name."
11:43;11:47;"And I'm not even saying because of that. I just don't like it."
11:47;11:50;"And I don't like how greasy they are."
11:50;11:54;"I don't know. There's something about having your full name, first and last name, on the cookie."
11:54;11:57;"I'm down with Sweet Martha's, but it should be Grandpa Spunkmeyer."
11:57;11:59;"Otis Spunkmeyer, it's arrogant."
11:59;12:02;"So I've always disliked Otis Spunkmeyer, but I just want to say that"
12:02;12:07;"Mr. Spunkmeyer, you spend all year trying to get into schools"
12:07;12:10;"and selling these gross cookies at the mall."
12:10;12:12;"I just want to say Sweet Martha's mops the floor with you."
12:12;12:16;"Sweet Martha's cleaning up three million in twelve days."
12:16;12:23;"In November 2006, the company was sold to IAWS Group for 561 million."
12:23;12:25;"That's how much Otis Spunkmeyer went for?"
12:25;12:30;"IAWS already owned Cuisine de France and La Brea Bakery"
12:30;12:35;"and merged with High Stand to form Azerta in 2008."
12:35;12:40;"Yeah, so you really want your cookie coming from an international conglomerate"
12:40;12:43;"that sounds like a cholesterol medication?"
12:43;12:45;"Yeah, like a pharmaceutical... Yeah, exactly."
12:45;12:46;"Azerta."
12:46;12:48;"Ask your doctor."
12:48;12:50;"Okay, well first of all, Azerta."
12:50;12:53;"561 million for Otis Spunkmeyer, you got ripped off."
12:53;12:55;"Yeah, you overpaid, dude. You overpaid like crazy."
12:55;12:57;"That's a Kushner move."
12:57;12:59;"Yeah."
12:59;13:01;"Jared Kushner definitely brokered that deal."
13:01;13:02;"That's like a half a billion."
13:02;13:06;"And I also want to say, Mr. Spunkmeyer, yeah, you got a big fat check,"
13:06;13:11;"but you know what? I'd rather be like some kind vibe Sweet Martha's thing."
13:11;13:16;"Just every 12 days, you rake in that check, and then the rest of the day you chill."
13:16;13:20;"Because it's like, would you really want to be a billionaire if it meant that every day"
13:20;13:23;"you're taking advantage of people?"
13:23;13:25;"You're waking up stressed out?"
13:25;13:29;"You know, forget-- like Sweet Martha's, that's the sweet spot of commerce."
13:29;13:35;"You made something, it's local, it's regional, people like it, you're getting paid great."
13:35;13:36;"You're a local legend."
13:36;13:38;"You don't need to franchise that out."
13:38;13:39;"No."
13:39;13:44;"If Sweet Martha and the gang spend the past 30 years building the brand,"
13:44;13:46;"they're like, we're opening one in Madison, Wisconsin."
13:46;13:48;"We're finally going to Chicago."
13:48;13:50;"She's down there all stressed out with the architect."
13:50;13:53;"Just like, oh my god, the Chicago and blah blah."
13:53;13:55;"Little by little, it's growing and growing."
13:55;13:58;"Then they get a chance to sell, and then they have to bring in all these finance dudes."
13:58;14:04;"And then finally, after 30 years of stressful stuff, getting in fights with Otis Spunkmeyer."
14:04;14:06;"What's the other one at the mall?"
14:06;14:07;"Mrs. Fields."
14:07;14:10;"You get in fights with Mrs. Fields, blah blah blah."
14:10;14:15;"And then finally, it's like you're 70, and you get that check for $561 million."
14:15;14:16;"And you're just like, cool."
14:16;14:18;"I could have been kicking it at the Lake House."
14:18;14:19;"Right."
14:19;14:20;"Great."
14:20;14:21;"Yeah, your kids are pissed off at you."
14:21;14:23;"Right."
14:23;14:27;"You know, the people that were OG Sweet Martha's fans are inundated."
14:27;14:29;"The stress of--"
14:29;14:32;"The quality of the product went down so far when they sold."
14:32;14:34;"The insane stress of when you first open--"
14:34;14:39;"When you're trying to open the one in Italy, and the local bakers revolted."
14:39;14:40;"Right, right."
14:47;14:49;"She looked me in my eye."
14:49;14:52;"She said, baby, I am not afraid to die."
14:52;14:54;"Push me to the edge."
14:54;14:55;"All my friends are dead."
14:55;14:57;"Push me to the edge."
14:57;14:58;"All my friends are dead."
14:58;15:00;"Push me to the edge."
15:00;15:02;"All my friends are dead."
15:02;15:03;"Push me to the edge."
15:03;15:05;"Phantom, that's all right."
15:05;15:06;"Inside all white."
15:06;15:08;"Like something you would rather slip."
15:08;15:09;"I do want that."
15:09;15:11;"My baby, I'm mad."
15:11;15:12;"I'm really her man now."
15:12;15:14;"Everybody got the same swag now."
15:14;15:15;"Watch the way I tear it down."
15:15;15:17;"Stackin' my bands all the way to the top."
15:17;15:18;"All the way to it, we fallin', yo."
15:18;15:20;"Every time that you leave, you're fine."
15:20;15:21;"Your girlfriend call me like, come on, yo."
15:21;15:22;"I like the way that she treat me."
15:22;15:23;"Gon' leave, you won't leave me."
15:23;15:24;"I call it that Casanova."
15:24;15:26;"She say I'm insane."
15:26;15:27;"Yeah, I wanna run away."
15:27;15:29;"Ah, ah, ah."
15:29;15:31;"Give me up the pain, ah."
15:31;15:34;"Please, make it go away."
15:34;15:35;"I'm committed, not addicted."
15:35;15:37;"But it keep controlling me."
15:37;15:38;"Out of pain, now I can feel it."
15:38;15:40;"I'm sweet and it's slowly."
15:40;15:41;"Yeah."
15:41;15:44;"I don't really care if you cry."
15:44;15:47;"I'm the real, you should've never lied."
15:47;15:54;"So when she look me in my eyes, she said, I am not afraid to die."
15:54;15:55;"I'm like Bizarre Day."
15:55;15:57;"Push me to the edge."
15:57;15:59;"I'm like Bizarre Day."
15:59;16:00;"Yeah."
16:00;16:01;"Push me to the edge."
16:01;16:03;"I'm like Bizarre Day, yeah."
16:05;16:06;"Daddy, not your swag."
16:06;16:08;"That's what you fake, girl."
16:08;16:11;"Y'all ain't-- I ain't wanna take my kid, no."
16:11;16:12;"Red hot, red hot."
16:12;16:14;"Dynastone, red hot."
16:14;16:15;"Yeah, man some."
16:15;16:17;"Look, dance some."
16:17;16:18;"Hey, yeah."
16:18;16:19;"Fast car, nice car."
16:19;16:20;"Dance some."
16:20;16:24;"In the club, they got no ones that we will back down."
16:24;16:25;"Yeah."
16:25;16:27;"Clubs from overseas got the racks and they all see."
16:27;16:29;"No, to you, it's not a cheat, bro."
16:29;16:32;"Looking at the stagger, look, your money, it all three, bro."
16:32;16:34;"I was counting, now that it's all 20s."
16:34;16:36;"That's a cheat, bro."
16:36;16:38;"She said, you're the worst."
16:38;16:39;"You're the worst."
16:39;16:43;"I cannot die, this my universe."
16:43;16:46;"I don't really care if you cry."
16:46;16:49;"I'm the real, you shouldn't have a lie."
16:49;16:52;"Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes."
16:52;16:56;"She said, baby, I am not afraid to die."
16:56;16:57;"Push me to the edge."
16:57;16:59;"All my friends are dead."
16:59;17:00;"Push me to the edge."
17:00;17:02;"All my friends are dead."
17:02;17:03;"Push me to the edge."
17:03;17:05;"All my friends are dead."
17:05;17:07;"Push me to the edge."
17:07;17:09;"So Jake, we got a hell of a show today."
17:09;17:10;"Sleep."
17:10;17:13;"Seinfeld 2000 helped us get a great guest."
17:13;17:15;"You want to tell us about the guest, Seinfeld?"
17:15;17:20;"Sure, her name is Kazzy David, and she's the daughter of Larry David,"
17:20;17:23;"the creator of a TV show called Curb Your Enthusiasm,"
17:23;17:28;"the co-creator of another show called Seinfeld, which was a popular sitcom."
17:28;17:29;"We're familiar."
17:29;17:31;"Yeah, I know her kind of through Instagram."
17:31;17:33;"There was some direct messaging going on,"
17:33;17:37;"and then she seemed very on brand for this particular program."
17:37;17:41;"And she's graciously agreed to join us."
17:41;17:44;"You've been hooking us up with a lot of great Seinfeld adjacent content,"
17:44;17:48;"because the truth is nobody wants to hear us really talk about the show,"
17:48;17:50;"but you got us the composer of the Seinfeld theme."
17:50;17:51;"That was great."
17:51;17:55;"And now you have Kazzy David, who not only is Larry David's daughter,"
17:55;17:58;"but she's also following in her father's footsteps now."
17:58;18:01;"She has a web series called The 86th, and it's very funny."
18:01;18:03;"It features her as Remy, a neurotic semi-narcissist"
18:03;18:07;"who across several episodes ranging four to eight minutes tries to win her breakup."
18:07;18:10;"But social media and technology, and again, her own neurosis,"
18:10;18:11;"keep thwarting every attempt."
18:11;18:13;"Very on brand for Time Crisis."
18:13;18:15;"So she's going to be here soon."
18:15;18:17;"Jake, we got a real heartwarming--"
18:17;18:20;"I love how Time Crisis is becoming kind of NPR."
18:20;18:23;"A real heartwarming story out of Belgium."
18:23;18:26;"Oh, this actually ties in nicely with Sweet Martha's."
18:26;18:30;"So going back to Sweet Martha's, and we're talking about on Time Crisis,"
18:30;18:32;"we don't necessarily have an ethos,"
18:32;18:39;"but more or less we really turn a critical eye on big corporate food."
18:39;18:40;"Sure."
18:40;18:42;"And we like small business."
18:42;18:44;"But we also have a critical eye on small business,"
18:44;18:46;"but similar to Sweet Martha's cookie jar,"
18:46;18:49;"which has built its own regional brand"
18:49;18:54;"despite the disgusting harassment of Otis Spunkmeyer and Mrs. Fields."
18:54;18:56;"And the Grandma's Corporation."
18:56;18:58;"We got a great email from Belgium."
18:58;19:00;"I want to read it."
19:00;19:04;"""Hi, Jake. My name is Celine. I'm a Belgian TC fan."
19:04;19:06;"I love the show and your paintings."""
19:06;19:07;"Nice."
19:07;19:09;"""I wanted to write you because I just read this article"
19:09;19:11;"in the Belgian newspaper De Morgan"
19:11;19:14;"about how Wendy's is prevented from expanding to Belgium"
19:14;19:18;"and the Netherlands because one man is unwilling to change the name"
19:18;19:21;"of his snack bar, which is also called Wendy's."
19:21;19:25;"He named it after his daughter, just like the founder of the American Wendy's."
19:25;19:29;"She sends a picture of him. He looks like kind of an average Joe."
19:29;19:32;"He's literally a stain on his shirt in the picture."
19:32;19:33;"He's got a little snack bar."
19:33;19:36;"They got sandwiches, fish and chips, fries."""
19:36;19:38;"It looks like it's in like an airport."
19:38;19:40;"It's got kind of an airport vibe."
19:40;19:43;"So she says, ""This year, Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Five Guys,"
19:43;19:46;"and TGI Friday have all opened up branches in the Netherlands."
19:46;19:48;"Obviously, Wendy's can't stay behind."""
19:48;19:49;"Damn, all this year?"
19:49;19:50;"I know, brutal."
19:50;19:53;"""But apparently they've been in a legal fight for almost 20 years now"
19:53;19:57;"with a small town snack bar owner who owns the rights to the name Wendy's."
19:57;20:00;"They might even be unable to expand to Europe at all"
20:00;20:02;"because of the persistent snack bar owner."
20:02;20:08;"In response, Wendy's hired the international law firm Hooyingrok Monegjer."
20:08;20:10;"When confirmed with their lawyers, the snack bar owner said,"
20:10;20:14;"'They look just like those CSI ladies. They look too perfect."
20:14;20:17;"Wendy's lost the lawsuit in February, but they are appealing against it yet again.'"""
20:17;20:19;"This is a great email. Thank you so much, Celine."
20:19;20:23;"And it's nice to hear from a Belgian time crisis fan."
20:23;20:25;"Time crisis, we got to take sides."
20:25;20:31;"I mean, Wendy's big corporation versus the little Wendy's guy in Belgium?"
20:31;20:32;"Like, come on."
20:32;20:33;"Yeah."
20:33;20:36;"I'm shocked that this is even an issue that like,"
20:36;20:38;"because he owns one snack bar."
20:38;20:40;"He doesn't own a chain of snack bars."
20:40;20:47;"Like, you could, like, I could open a sandwich place on like Sunset and call it Wendy's."
20:47;20:48;"No, I bet you couldn't."
20:48;20:49;"I bet I could."
20:49;20:50;"No, they wouldn't. No, man."
20:50;20:51;"No, come on."
20:51;20:52;"I'm surprised that you did."
20:52;20:54;"If I call it Wendy's, okay."
20:54;20:57;"His is Wendy's Fish and Chips."
20:57;20:59;"So what if mine was like Wendy's--"
20:59;21:01;"Dude, these big corporations are psycho."
21:01;21:03;"--sandwiches and wraps."
21:03;21:09;"I bet we could open a cookie stand called Wendy's on La Cienega, and Wendy's would sue us."
21:09;21:11;"They'd be like, ""We don't like-- No, these companies are crazy."""
21:11;21:16;"Really? Because Wendy's is like, that's a name that's general enough that other companies could use."
21:16;21:17;"Like, it's on McDonald's."
21:17;21:18;"One would think."
21:18;21:20;"And it's not even Arby's."
21:20;21:22;"But even McDonald's."
21:22;21:27;"I bet if we opened a burger place called McDonald's and we were like, ""You know what? It's just a great Scottish name,"""
21:27;21:28;"they would sue us like crazy."
21:28;21:29;"Yeah, I believe that."
21:29;21:33;"No, because corporations have this insane power where they can, like, keep a name like that."
21:33;21:36;"So it's insane that--"
21:36;21:38;"Well, first of all, I think it's cool."
21:38;21:43;"Like, why should Wendy's just get to go all over the world and, like, trample this guy's rights?"
21:43;21:44;"Yeah, absolutely."
21:44;21:46;"And they're coming with some big law firm."
21:46;21:49;"I love that quote about the CSI ladies."
21:49;21:53;"Yeah, and also, you know, there's a country like Burger King in Australia is called Hungry Jacks."
21:53;21:54;"Okay, so they do the--"
21:54;21:56;"Copyright law is funny."
21:56;21:58;"I hope this guy holds out."
21:58;22:04;"Yeah, I mean, if we have anybody in Belgium or Netherlands listening, please support--"
22:04;22:06;"Love to get him on the phone."
22:06;22:08;"Yeah, yeah. Oh, we should try to get him on. That'd be great."
22:08;22:10;"That'd be an interesting talk."
22:10;22:17;"I also want to point out, time crisis has always been harsh on Wendy's, like, the international corporation."
22:17;22:19;"They have that weird thing about how fresh they are."
22:19;22:20;"Right."
22:20;22:25;"Also, really? Wendy's? Like, how many locations do you think Wendy's has globally?"
22:25;22:26;"Thousands."
22:26;22:27;"Hold on."
22:27;22:28;"You're going to guess."
22:28;22:31;"I want to say, like, around 10,000."
22:31;22:34;"That's-- I was going to say, like, 2,500."
22:34;22:35;"No, no, way more than that."
22:35;22:36;"Really?"
22:36;22:38;"McDonald's is, like, 30,000 locations."
22:38;22:40;"I know, but McDonald's is, like, insane."
22:40;22:42;"But Wendy's is no joke, dude."
22:42;22:44;"Can we get a number crunch on that?"
22:44;22:45;"6,100."
22:45;22:46;"Okay."
22:46;22:47;"Split the difference."
22:48;22:51;"Okay, so I'm just saying, you have 6,100 Wendy's in the world."
22:51;22:54;"You really need it in Netherlands and Belgium?"
22:54;22:55;"Just chill."
22:55;22:56;"Take the L."
22:56;22:59;"In fact, I'm boycotting Wendy's until they leave this man alone."
22:59;23:00;"I like that."
23:00;23:03;"Wendy's, stay the hell out of the Flemish-speaking part of the world."
23:03;23:06;"There's already enough burgers there, as is."
23:06;23:08;"Yeah, chill, Wendy's."
23:15;23:18;"Time Crisis on Beat 1."
24:50;24:53;"So we are now joined in the studio by Kazzy David."
24:53;24:54;"Where'd you grow up, L.A.?"
24:54;24:56;"I grew up in Brentwood, yeah."
24:56;24:57;"Oh, nice."
24:57;25:01;"So I had a very enclosed childhood."
25:01;25:02;"What year were you born?"
25:02;25:03;"1994."
25:03;25:05;"Ooh, Brentwood '94."
25:05;25:07;"What was going on then?"
25:07;25:09;"Brentwood '94."
25:09;25:11;"When was O.J.?"
25:11;25:12;"'94, bro."
25:12;25:13;"That was '94."
25:13;25:16;"Were you born before or after the murder?"
25:16;25:19;"I know so little about this murder."
25:19;25:23;"I have no idea when I was born around that time."
25:23;25:25;"Wait, what month were you born?"
25:25;25:26;"May."
25:26;25:27;"I don't know when it was."
25:27;25:28;"Yeah, you guys can figure that out."
25:28;25:30;"The murders were in June of '94."
25:30;25:34;"So your parents are at home in Brentwood with their baby daughter."
25:34;25:35;"Month old."
25:35;25:43;"Flip on the TV, their next door neighbor is ripping down the freeway in a Ford Bronco."
25:43;25:45;"End in earthquake the same year?"
25:45;25:46;"Wow."
25:46;25:47;"And the riots two years before that."
25:47;25:48;"Yeah."
25:48;25:49;"So what--"
25:49;25:50;"[laughter]"
25:50;25:53;"Talking early, mid '90s L.A. history at this point."
25:53;25:54;"It was a crazy time."
25:54;25:56;"Is there a lot of fast food out in Brentwood?"
25:56;25:58;"Obviously, that's an affluent community."
25:58;26:00;"There's a lot of fancy restaurants."
26:00;26:01;"You got the Country Mart."
26:01;26:03;"Yeah, the Country Mart's the [bleep]"
26:03;26:06;"They're not going to have a Wendy's at the Country Mart."
26:06;26:08;"So what do you have out there?"
26:08;26:09;"There's a soup plantation, right?"
26:09;26:11;"There's a soup plantation."
26:11;26:13;"I think there might be a Baja Fresh."
26:13;26:15;"Is there a main drag in Brentwood?"
26:15;26:17;"Yeah, there's San Vicente."
26:17;26:20;"There's Montana, but then you're getting into Santa Monica."
26:20;26:22;"I don't know this area at all."
26:22;26:24;"But I don't eat fast food."
26:24;26:25;"I have never had."
26:25;26:26;"Did you ever?"
26:26;26:27;"Never?"
26:27;26:28;"No."
26:28;26:29;"So no fast food?"
26:29;26:30;"None."
26:30;26:31;"I'm intrigued."
26:31;26:32;"So what about-- how old are you now?"
26:32;26:33;"I'm 23."
26:33;26:34;"It took me--"
26:34;26:35;"Have you been to Del Taco?"
26:35;26:36;"No."
26:36;26:37;"Have you been to Taco Bell?"
26:37;26:38;"You grew up in Southern California?"
26:38;26:39;"No."
26:39;26:40;"In-N-Out?"
26:40;26:42;"I had In-N-Out maybe twice."
26:42;26:43;"Wow."
26:43;26:44;"McDonald's?"
26:44;26:45;"No."
26:45;26:46;"Not once?"
26:46;26:47;"You've never had McDonald's in your life?"
26:47;26:48;"I had fries like one time."
26:48;26:50;"And they were somebody else's fries?"
26:50;26:51;"Yeah."
26:51;26:52;"Wow."
26:52;26:56;"Because I also feel like I grew up in kind of a crunchy, health food oriented household,"
26:56;26:59;"but I wanted it more."
26:59;27:01;"It makes me feel so sick."
27:01;27:02;"That's fair."
27:02;27:03;"Good for you."
27:03;27:04;"And my parents just terrified me about it."
27:04;27:07;"They just scared me so badly that I never want it."
27:07;27:08;"Yeah."
27:08;27:09;"I'm so scared to eat anything that's bad."
27:09;27:12;"So do you remember feeling the draw to McDonald's?"
27:12;27:16;"Like your friends were hitting McDonald's in high school, and you were just like, ""My"
27:16;27:18;"parents scared the shit out of me."""
27:18;27:22;"I think there was like one thing that I was really jealous of, and I would just like be"
27:22;27:26;"so upset that I didn't have it, and it was the frosting with the sprinkles that you dip"
27:26;27:27;"dips."
27:27;27:28;"Oh yeah."
27:28;27:29;"Oh, that's nasty."
27:29;27:30;"Those were good."
27:30;27:31;"Yeah."
27:31;27:32;"Right."
27:32;27:33;"And that's like pure sugar."
27:33;27:34;"That was like, ""Please, Mom, get me these sticks."""
27:34;27:37;"But when you're like a senior in high school at lunch, and kids have cars, and they're"
27:37;27:40;"like, ""We're going to McDonald's,"" and you'd be like, ""Guys, my parents are going to kill"
27:40;27:41;"me."
27:41;27:42;"I'm just going to get high in the parking lot."""
27:42;27:44;"Yeah, that was pretty much."
27:44;27:45;"Or you were just like, ""I'm not interested."""
27:45;27:47;"I was kind of like, ""You guys are gross."
27:47;27:49;"You shouldn't be going to McDonald's."""
27:49;27:50;"Look at you."
27:50;27:51;"Nice."
27:51;27:52;"God."
27:52;27:53;"I'm grossed out by you."
27:53;27:54;"That's advanced."
27:54;27:55;"I don't need McDonald's to have fun."
27:55;27:56;"Yeah."
27:56;27:57;"And honestly, I feel bad for you guys."
27:57;28:00;"[MUSIC - THE KILLERS, ""IT COULD BE A SPOONFUL OF DIAMOND""]"
28:01;28:05;"Could be a spoonful of gold."
28:05;28:13;"Just a little spoon of your precious love, it would have satisfied my soul."
28:13;28:17;"Mean lies about a little."
28:17;28:21;"Some of them cries about a little."
28:21;28:27;"Some of them dies about a little."
28:27;28:33;"Everything about a spoonful, it's spoonful, it's spoonful."
28:33;28:43;"It could be a spoonful of gold."
28:43;28:48;"It could be a spoonful of diamond."
28:48;28:56;"But a little spoon of your precious love, well, that's good enough for me."
28:56;29:00;"Mean lies about a little."
29:00;29:04;"Some of them cries about a little."
29:04;29:09;"Some of them dies about a little."
29:09;29:17;"Everything about a spoonful, it's spoonful, it's spoonful."
29:17;29:21;"That's a spoon, that's a spoon, that's a spoon."
29:21;29:28;"Bah, bah."
29:28;29:29;"That's spoonful."
29:29;29:36;"Yeah, bah, bah, bah, bah."
29:36;29:43;"It could be a spoonful of water."
29:43;29:48;"Save you from the desert sand."
29:48;29:56;"But one spoon of lip from my 45 will save you from another man."
29:56;30:00;"Mean lies about a little."
30:00;30:04;"Some of them cries about a little."
30:04;30:09;"Some of them dies about a little."
30:09;30:15;"Everything about a spoonful, it's spoonful, it's spoonful."
30:15;30:17;"You love your web series."
30:17;30:22;"I did notice one thing that prominently in one episode, there's ice cream."
30:22;30:23;"Yeah."
30:23;30:25;"So you could just go get ice cream."
30:25;30:27;"I like ice cream. Ice cream I'll do."
30:27;30:34;"But the ice cream we got is like very organic, which embarrassingly enough, it's like the healthiest ice cream you can eat."
30:34;30:35;"Well, what's it called?"
30:35;30:36;"Sweet Rose."
30:36;30:38;"They use some special sugar or something?"
30:38;30:44;"It's like it's regular sugar and dairy, but it's like all their ingredients are from like the farmer's market."
30:44;30:46;"Right. Local."
30:46;30:48;"I'm so LA and annoying."
30:48;30:49;"So no, that's fine."
30:49;30:56;"Well, one thing that I liked about it, the kind of like thing that you point out in that episode, and I've thought about this before in this episode,"
30:56;31:04;"your character gets ice cream on a cone and the two people she's with get in a cup and she's going through a tough time in her life."
31:04;31:08;"And she's saying like, you guys couldn't have just gotten a cone in solidarity with me."
31:08;31:10;"And I've thought about that a lot. It is funny."
31:10;31:17;"Like when you go get ice cream with people, because already in our culture, we know that there's something shameful about going to get ice cream."
31:17;31:20;"We know that we're doing something bad when we go to get ice cream together."
31:20;31:21;"Right."
31:21;31:23;"And so it's a little bit."
31:23;31:24;"Bummer."
31:24;31:27;"No, I'm just saying like we live in a like a very health conscious culture."
31:27;31:28;"Right."
31:28;31:30;"Where like it's hard to just enjoy ice cream."
31:30;31:32;"Like we know we're being bad. That's how I feel."
31:32;31:40;"You know, you're being bad, but it's kind of like so if you're going, the whole experience of ice cream does involve getting a cone, which you expertly pointed out."
31:40;31:45;"And it's funny if you like make a plan to get ice cream and then you get the cone and then somebody else just gets a cup."
31:45;31:46;"Right."
31:46;31:49;"It's a little bit like I thought we were going to rob this bank together."
31:49;31:50;"Right."
31:50;31:51;"Yeah."
31:51;31:57;"I think that's so much stuff, though, because there's sometimes where you're out for dinner with friends and you're like, does anyone else want to get a drink?"
31:57;32:00;"And if they don't want to get a drink, you're like, OK, thanks."
32:00;32:03;"I guess I won't get a drink, but it's not their fault that you can't drink."
32:03;32:05;"But it is at the same time."
32:05;32:06;"Yeah, I just ignore that."
32:06;32:07;"I just get a drink."
32:07;32:08;"Yeah."
32:08;32:17;"You know, it's also weird when people some people feel very strongly about they don't want to eat if the other person's not eating."
32:17;32:19;"That's a weird girl thing."
32:19;32:20;"Do you guys do that?"
32:20;32:22;"You mean if the food comes before the other food comes?"
32:22;32:23;"No, no."
32:23;32:25;"Or just like I already had lunch. I'll sit with you."
32:25;32:29;"Yeah, because I feel like the whole thing is we're just getting together to chop it up."
32:29;32:31;"We're just going to have a good time."
32:31;32:43;"Like I would say, Jake, if you OK, if you hit me up, if you were my neighborhood and you said, hey, man, I'm in the hood, starving, starving, want to crush a burrito with me."
32:43;32:46;"And I say, you know what, Jake?"
32:46;32:52;"I already cooked myself a nice organic stir fry at home, but I'd love to come sit with you at the burrito place."
32:52;32:53;"Chipotle."
32:53;32:54;"Yeah, Chipotle."
32:54;32:59;"Would you be like, sweet, meet you there, or would you be like, forget it?"
32:59;33:01;"I'd probably be like, forget it."
33:01;33:02;"Really?"
33:02;33:08;"I'd want to hang, but I wouldn't want to like subject you to like sitting at the Chipotle with me."
33:08;33:12;"I'm picturing the Chipotle on Beverly and La Brea."
33:12;33:13;"Melrose and La Brea."
33:13;33:16;"OK, sorry, Melrose and La Brea, Chipotle."
33:16;33:18;"I'm like, dude, I'm like 10 minutes out."
33:18;33:20;"Roll at me."
33:20;33:21;"Let's meet."
33:21;33:23;"I'm going to sit down and eat a burrito in front of you."
33:23;33:26;"You don't want me to come to the Chipotle because I already ate?"
33:26;33:27;"It depends."
33:27;33:32;"Like, it's honestly like a really hard call."
33:32;33:35;"I think it depends on like what I'm dealing with."
33:35;33:37;"I just want to add one wrinkle to the equation."
33:37;33:39;"You're working that day."
33:39;33:41;"You're sweating it out on the job site all morning."
33:41;33:42;"OK."
33:42;33:44;"You have 45 minutes for lunch."
33:44;33:47;"We haven't seen each other in a few weeks because you've been at all these weddings."
33:47;33:49;"And then you hit me up."
33:49;33:54;"I got a tight 45 to leave the job site, hit Chipotle and get back to the job site."
33:54;33:56;"I love this job site."
33:56;33:58;"Do you want to link up?"
33:58;34:01;"And I say, absolutely, man."
34:01;34:02;"I'd love to see you in ketchup."
34:02;34:09;"Although, I'll be honest, I did just go to Sweet Greens and eat a kind of kale thing."
34:09;34:10;"Kale Caesar."
34:10;34:13;"Are you going to literally just slam the door shut?"
34:13;34:15;"We're not going to see each other otherwise."
34:15;34:16;"I am."
34:16;34:17;"I'm going to slam it."
34:18;34:19;"Wow."
34:19;34:23;"I know we're trying to get away from this, but I actually thought of the example that is better than yours."
34:23;34:24;"OK."
34:24;34:31;"So you and your friend both have lunch together and you get the same lunch, like the same amount of food."
34:31;34:35;"And then two hours later, you're kind of in the mood for a snack."
34:35;34:37;"And you're like, I think we should get a snack."
34:37;34:38;"Don't you think?"
34:38;34:42;"And they're like, no, I'm not really hungry."
34:42;34:43;"OK."
34:43;34:46;"Then you're like, that sucks."
34:46;34:47;"Because you guys are just spending all day together."
34:47;34:50;"Because you would feel like we had the same amount of food."
34:50;34:52;"Why am I hungry and you're not?"
34:52;34:54;"Oh."
34:54;34:56;"So it's a full day hang."
34:56;34:57;"Yeah."
34:57;34:58;"Like, why are we not both wanting a snack right now?"
34:58;34:59;"Right."
34:59;35:01;"I mean, that's almost like a couple situation."
35:01;35:02;"Maybe."
35:02;35:04;"Like a couple, like, you know, eat lunch with your girlfriend."
35:04;35:05;"It's the same thing."
35:05;35:06;"And then two hours later, you're just like--"
35:06;35:09;"Yeah, but in a couple, you know each other so well that--"
35:09;35:10;"OK."
35:10;35:11;"So there's less--"
35:11;35:13;"It's more of a competitive friend thing."
35:13;35:14;"Right."
35:14;35:15;"Yeah."
35:15;35:16;"And a couple, it's not going to be--"
35:16;35:17;"You're like, I really could go for a Modelo."
35:17;35:18;"She's going to-- of course you can."
35:18;35:19;"Yeah, copy that."
35:19;35:20;"[MUSIC - THE KING, ""HAPPY TIMES""]"
35:20;35:26;"I hear some people, they're talking me down."
35:26;35:31;"Bring up my name, pass it around."
35:31;35:37;"They don't mention the happy times."
35:37;35:43;"They do their thing, I do mine."
35:43;35:48;"Oh, baby, that's hard to change."
35:48;35:54;"I can't tell them how to feel."
35:54;36:00;"Some get strong, some get strange."
36:00;36:05;"Sooner or later, it all gets real."
36:05;36:14;"Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on."
36:28;36:34;"I remember the good old days."
36:34;36:39;"Stayed up all night getting crazed."
36:39;36:45;"Then the money was not so good."
36:45;36:51;"But we still did the best we could."
36:51;36:56;"Oh, baby, that's hard to change."
36:56;37:02;"I can't tell them how to feel."
37:02;37:08;"Some get strong, some get strange."
37:08;37:13;"Sooner or later, it all gets real."
37:13;37:18;"Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on."
37:18;37:22;"So Kazzy, as we said earlier, Seinfeld 2000"
37:22;37:24;"is what brought you to Time Crisis."
37:24;37:25;"So we have him on the mic."
37:25;37:26;"What's up, Seinfeld?"
37:26;37:30;"Hey, what's up?"
37:30;37:33;"So you guys met via Instagram DMs."
37:33;37:34;"Yeah."
37:35;37:37;"The most millennial way to meet someone."
37:37;37:38;"Extreme millennial."
37:38;37:39;"Slid into my DMs."
37:39;37:42;"Which is probably why you thought I was 15, 14 years old."
37:42;37:43;"Yeah, maybe 16."
37:43;37:44;"Seinfeld 2000 is a man."
37:44;37:46;"We won't say much beyond that."
37:46;37:48;"He's a full-grown man."
37:48;37:49;"He's a full-grown man."
37:49;37:50;"And tall."
37:50;37:51;"Good looking, too."
37:51;37:52;"And handsome."
37:52;37:53;"Oh, absolutely."
37:53;37:54;"Appreciate it."
37:54;37:56;"Okay, so this kind of begs the question."
37:56;37:58;"Obviously, Seinfeld must have loomed large in your life"
37:58;38:00;"with your father being the co-creator."
38:00;38:02;"But is it a situation where people assume that,"
38:02;38:05;"wow, you must have grown up so in the mix with Seinfeld?"
38:05;38:07;"I guess by the time Seinfeld was off the air,"
38:07;38:09;"what, you four?"
38:09;38:10;"Yeah, I was so young."
38:10;38:14;"I mean, there's like pictures of me as a baby on the set and stuff."
38:14;38:17;"But I don't remember anything because I was so little."
38:17;38:21;"But I didn't know the impact until I really went to college."
38:21;38:24;"And people were like, whoa, that's your dad?"
38:24;38:27;"Well, I went to basically like screenwriting school for TV."
38:27;38:31;"So it was like in every class, and I was like, whoa, this is so weird."
38:31;38:33;"I guess I'm an idiot."
38:33;38:36;"Wait, that's a thing when you're 18?"
38:36;38:39;"Well, Emerson has the major in screenwriting for TV."
38:39;38:40;"Gotcha."
38:40;38:43;"When it came up, would kind of the whole class look at you kind of thing?"
38:43;38:46;"I hoped most people didn't know about it, but some people did,"
38:46;38:48;"and some people would look at me."
38:48;38:50;"But it was awkward."
38:50;38:52;"I could imagine this situation would be."
38:52;38:53;"Is it awkward?"
38:53;38:57;"Because, you know, Seinfeld 2000, as a major Seinfeld enthusiast,"
38:57;39:03;"on the show many times, another beloved '90s sitcom, Friends, comes up."
39:03;39:04;"And I can see that."
39:04;39:05;"Yeah, exactly."
39:05;39:11;"The way he, even just the word ""Friends,"" he just bristles at it."
39:11;39:12;"He really dislikes it."
39:12;39:15;"He's agnostic on Frasier, but Friends really bothers him."
39:15;39:18;"That really makes me so happy, though, I have to tell you."
39:18;39:22;"Because there's a lot of people that don't even know that it was a copy."
39:22;39:23;"Yeah, I know."
39:23;39:25;"There's people that aren't even aware of it."
39:25;39:26;"No."
39:26;39:27;"Wait, wait, wait."
39:27;39:28;"It's really upsetting."
39:28;39:29;"I think I might be one of these people."
39:29;39:31;"Friends is a copy of Seinfeld?"
39:31;39:34;"How many shows were in a New York apartment before Seinfeld?"
39:34;39:35;"Okay, I'll tell you."
39:35;39:37;"Family, domestic situations."
39:37;39:38;"Honeymooners."
39:38;39:40;"Friends wasn't the only one that copied it, also."
39:40;39:42;"Oh, right, because it wasn't a family show."
39:42;39:44;"But there's so many factors to it."
39:44;39:49;"I mean, they could easily have just had Chandler and Joey live a door down,"
39:49;39:51;"and it had to be right across."
39:51;39:52;"That's the exact same--"
39:52;39:56;"I mean, there's actual shots, cinematic shots, that were taken."
39:56;39:59;"It goes so far, but I'm so passionate about it,"
39:59;40:04;"because I can't really talk about it, because people are like, ""Okay, yeah."""
40:04;40:09;"Right, but you feel like you looked at the evidence dispassionately."
40:09;40:10;"Yeah."
40:10;40:12;"And you realize that this is the case."
40:12;40:13;"It couldn't be more obvious."
40:13;40:15;"I feel like tonally, they're worlds apart."
40:15;40:19;"I mean, yes, they're both set in New York with people in their apartments."
40:19;40:21;"First of all, the Friends people are in their 20s."
40:21;40:22;"Yeah."
40:22;40:24;"The Seinfeld characters are in their late 20s, 30s."
40:24;40:25;"Okay, yeah."
40:25;40:26;"But also--"
40:26;40:27;"Yeah, massive difference."
40:27;40:28;"No, no, no, no, no, no."
40:28;40:29;"Not to split hairs."
40:29;40:30;"Not splitting hairs."
40:30;40:31;"Totally couldn't be farther apart."
40:31;40:35;"Yeah, I mean, you're not going to be able to write the same way."
40:35;40:36;"That would be impossible."
40:36;40:40;"But, I mean, I think they were like, ""Oh, that show did really well."
40:40;40:43;"Let's make the exact same plot, but we'll be writing it."""
40:43;40:44;"So it'll be--"
40:44;40:47;"I mean, I don't know if that's exactly what they thought, but it's like--"
40:47;40:48;"Who created Friends?"
40:48;40:51;"Someone named Marty Kaufman and then two other people."
40:51;40:53;"Crane, I remember seeing in a credit."
40:53;40:54;"I love Friends, by the way."
40:54;40:55;"Okay, so you're not mad at it."
40:55;40:56;"I watch Friends all the time."
40:56;40:57;"Okay, that's important to point out."
40:57;41:00;"I watch it all the time, but I know it copied."
41:00;41:02;"Is there a Kazzy Kaufman?"
41:02;41:04;"Have you guys ever crossed paths?"
41:04;41:06;"[laughter]"
41:06;41:09;"No, that would be very funny."
41:09;41:15;"So, Seinfeld 2000, maybe some Time Crisis listeners might primarily know you"
41:15;41:18;"as you're the person who runs Time Crisis 2000, the account."
41:18;41:20;"You have your Twitter account, but more than ever,"
41:20;41:22;"you have this thriving Instagram account."
41:22;41:25;"Yeah, it's booming, for sure."
41:25;41:31;"And before you came on board as one of--a beloved member of the team,"
41:31;41:34;"back when you and I were kind of more, I guess, what you'd call frenemies,"
41:34;41:37;"you were this wild Twitter account that I really liked."
41:37;41:40;"And we've had our ups and downs, but we kind of ended up in a good place."
41:40;41:44;"And at this point, not only do I consider our beef squashed,"
41:44;41:48;"I really--I feel defensive of you and Seinfeld 2000."
41:48;41:54;"I've noticed because Instagram--just one more way that social media can toy"
41:54;41:59;"with our emotions--they've gotten the Explore column on Instagram."
41:59;42:02;"Whatever they did to the algorithm, it's bananas."
42:02;42:04;"I'm trying to pay attention to something."
42:04;42:06;"I'm like, ""Let me close this [bleep]."""
42:06;42:08;"And then it's literally--I've got it open again,"
42:08;42:10;"and I have no memory of opening it again."
42:10;42:13;"You ever have that experience? You close Instagram, and you're looking at it again?"
42:13;42:16;"And increasingly, I don't even look at my feed,"
42:16;42:19;"so I don't even look at what's happening with my friends and loved ones."
42:19;42:22;"I'm just looking at this, ""Do I interact with accounts similar to this one?"""
42:22;42:23;"So I'll show you this one. So anyway--"
42:23;42:24;"I never look at that."
42:24;42:26;"Don't look, man. It's going to suck you in."
42:26;42:28;"You'll never be able to stop. Jeez. All right."
42:28;42:31;"Because I follow Seinfeld 2000, I'm getting all these Seinfeld accounts."
42:31;42:33;"And increasingly, I'm looking at some of them, and I'm like,"
42:33;42:35;"""Is this Seinfeld 2000?"""
42:35;42:39;"Because it's this whole booming industry, and I feel like you're the OG."
42:39;42:42;"Is it fair to say that you're the first person"
42:42;42:44;"who ever took an image from the news"
42:44;42:49;"and then did a slow zoom and played the Curb Your Enthusiasm music?"
42:49;42:51;"Well, here's the thing about that."
42:51;42:54;"You know when you can have an idea, and you think it's an independent idea,"
42:54;42:56;"and then concurrently there's been another idea?"
42:56;42:58;"Like Edison and Tesla."
42:58;42:59;"Exactly. Or--"
42:59;43:01;"Seinfeld and France."
43:01;43:03;"You're right. It's Ziggy."
43:03;43:06;"People have pointed out to me that this apparently was a thing"
43:06;43:10;"called the Frolic Effect that was a thing on YouTube."
43:10;43:14;"But as far as I'm concerned, I kind of took it to another level."
43:14;43:18;"If you thought of it yourself, you get the credit for it."
43:18;43:20;"And I feel like he brought it to Twitter and to Instagram."
43:20;43:21;"True."
43:21;43:24;"You did the first Chris Christie one standing next to Trump, right?"
43:24;43:25;"Yes."
43:25;43:28;"That was a pivotal moment in that meme."
43:28;43:30;"Seinfeld 2000 is so cool, by the way,"
43:30;43:32;"because it actually isn't just like repeating memes."
43:32;43:35;"It's original. It's an original concept."
43:35;43:38;"And sometimes people think that these memes are repeated or,"
43:38;43:39;"""Oh, you took that from me?"""
43:39;43:41;"No, it's all stuff that I come up with."
43:41;43:42;"I try to be original."
43:42;43:44;"So thank you for recognizing that."
43:44;43:46;"I have to ask what your guys' beef was about, though,"
43:46;43:49;"because that was like a quick mention."
43:49;43:50;"That's true."
43:50;43:53;"And sometimes Crisis listeners, depending on when they got on board,"
43:53;43:54;"might not remember."
43:54;43:58;"And maybe you can chime in here."
43:58;44:01;"This guy for years has this deeply held belief"
44:01;44:04;"that Seinfeld could come back on TV."
44:04;44:07;"He started out guessing about what Seinfeld would be like if it was on TV."
44:07;44:11;"And then eventually a corner was turned where he wasn't just saying,"
44:11;44:14;"""Imagining a modern Seinfeld."""
44:14;44:17;"He truly started to believe that it might happen."
44:17;44:19;"And I just think there's no evidence to support that."
44:19;44:21;"And I would sometimes say to him, ""This is a pipe dream."""
44:21;44:24;"And the way he would react, it would be as if I told him"
44:24;44:27;"that Donald Trump wasn't president."
44:27;44:28;"It's like a 9/11 conspiracy."
44:28;44:31;"Did we ever think that Donald Trump would be president?"
44:31;44:33;"No, and yet here we are."
44:33;44:34;"That's a very good argument."
44:34;44:37;"Okay, I picked a terrible example."
44:37;44:41;"Okay, but my point is that the way that you would talk about it"
44:41;44:43;"made me feel unheard."
44:43;44:46;"And the way that you jumped down my throat about it--"
44:46;44:47;"That is so funny."
44:47;44:49;"You jumped down my throat about it, and I just--"
44:49;44:53;"Guys, guys, you know, we're cool now, and that's really all that matters."
44:53;44:55;"Believe my words, I swear I will"
44:55;44:58;"If I am wrong, I'll pay the bill"
44:58;45:00;"No God for me, I look, but still"
45:00;45:05;"There's one here up my sleeve"
45:05;45:08;"Believe I'm wrong, I'll never win"
45:08;45:10;"But I've been around when times are thin"
45:10;45:13;"Will I miss you? I bet I will"
45:13;45:18;"I might even lose some sleep"
45:18;45:23;"bass & drums play rock"
46:13;46:37;"Believe my words, I swear I will"
46:37;46:39;"If I am wrong, I'll pay the bill"
46:39;46:42;"No God for me, I look, but still"
46:42;46:46;"There's one here up my sleeve"
46:46;46:49;"Believe my words, if I am wrong"
46:49;46:51;"You can count when I sing my song"
46:51;46:54;"You don't hate me, you hate my tongue"
46:54;46:56;"You won't even read my will"
46:56;46:59;"Won't even read my will"

47:40;47:48;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Kainin."
47:48;47:52;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-beast one."
47:52;47:53;"- I have another question. - Yeah."
47:53;47:55;"- You kind of have an accent."
47:55;47:56;"- I have an accent? - Yeah."
47:56;47:57;"Where are you from?"
47:57;48:00;"- Okay, this is interesting because my whole life,"
48:00;48:03;"people have said to me that I have an accent."
48:03;48:04;"So I was born in New York,"
48:04;48:07;"but I grew up in New Jersey, Northern New Jersey."
48:07;48:10;"So my entire life I've been in the Northern New Jersey,"
48:10;48:11;"New York metro area. - That's not the accent."
48:11;48:13;"I think that wasn't it."
48:13;48:15;"- I remember being in high school"
48:15;48:18;"and I think I went on a trip with, a band trip."
48:18;48:23;"And we were with another regional New Jersey"
48:23;48:25;"high school band and we were like in a hotel."
48:25;48:26;"And I remember-- - Band."
48:26;48:28;"You have an accent."
48:28;48:29;"Band, band."
48:29;48:31;"- I think it's unique to Ezra."
48:31;48:32;"- It's cool."
48:32;48:33;"No, I really like it."
48:33;48:34;"I was just wondering if it's from somewhere."
48:34;48:34;"- Yeah, I've thought about it a lot."
48:34;48:37;"Like my parents, I think,"
48:37;48:40;"wait Jake, have you chatted with my parents before?"
48:40;48:41;"- I don't think so."
48:41;48:42;"- Like my dad's from the Bronx."
48:42;48:44;"My mom grew up in Jersey."
48:44;48:45;"My thing, my friends think of them"
48:45;48:48;"as having like New York accents kind of,"
48:48;48:49;"but you don't hear this as a New York, New Jersey accent."
48:49;48:51;"- My first thought was that you might've been"
48:51;48:54;"like maybe a little Norwegian."
48:54;48:56;"- Whoa, wow, didn't see that coming."
48:56;48:57;"- Just a little. - Deep."
48:57;48:59;"- It's like slightly."
48:59;49:00;"- Like not American."
49:00;49:02;"- No, I mean, yes,"
49:02;49:04;"but you have a little ting."
49:04;49:07;"- What's like the Brentwood accent?"
49:07;49:09;"- You know, I was talking about this"
49:09;49:10;"with someone recently,"
49:10;49:13;"like where accents originate."
49:13;49:15;"And everyone was just like, oh yeah,"
49:15;49:18;"like California is the only one without an accent,"
49:18;49:21;"but that's just because other people have different accents."
49:21;49:22;"So I guess it is an accent."
49:22;49:24;"- I'm trying to imagine if I just heard your voice,"
49:24;49:25;"didn't know anything about you,"
49:25;49:26;"would I think this is California?"
49:26;49:28;"You know what's funny about Jake?"
49:28;49:30;"Jake was born and raised in Connecticut,"
49:30;49:32;"John Mayer's home state."
49:32;49:33;"(laughing)"
49:33;49:36;"And I feel like Jake spent so much time on the West Coast"
49:36;49:38;"'cause he went to college in Portland,"
49:38;49:40;"lived in SF for a while, LA,"
49:40;49:43;"that Jake and Jake's whole vibe is so West Coast"
49:43;49:47;"that I feel like your cadence and your language is very,"
49:47;49:50;"maybe not LA, but certainly West Coast."
49:50;49:52;"But that might be more vocabulary."
49:52;49:53;"- Yeah, I don't know."
49:53;49:54;"- At your school,"
49:54;49:56;"would people use the phrase crush a burrito?"
49:56;49:58;"- No."
49:58;50:00;"- Gnarly, did they say buff?"
50:00;50:03;"- They said some gnarly, I guess."
50:03;50:03;"- Oh, gnarly, really?"
50:03;50:07;"- I feel like my lingo is just based on my group of friends."
50:07;50:08;"Groups of friends form their own"
50:08;50:11;"sort of like linguistic ecosystems."
50:11;50:12;"- True."
50:12;50:14;"- Where there's sort of like, I don't know, yeah,"
50:14;50:16;"just like catch phrases or slang just thrown around."
50:16;50:17;"- No, and definitely you've rubbed off on me."
50:17;50:19;"I was doing an interview recently"
50:19;50:21;"and I did describe something as gnarly."
50:21;50:24;"I was like, would I have said that a few years ago"
50:24;50:25;"when I was in--"
50:25;50:26;"- That warms my heart."
50:26;50:28;"- Yeah, gnarly comes up."
50:28;50:30;"- It's a buff traffic sitch."
50:30;50:33;"- Yeah, are you familiar with the phrase buff traffic sitch?"
50:33;50:35;"- No, I've never heard buff before."
50:35;50:36;"- You don't know buff?"
50:36;50:37;"- No."
50:37;50:40;"- Buff is super, like, I'm not a surfer,"
50:40;50:42;"but I have a lot of friends that are surfers."
50:42;50:44;"- Yeah, you actually do sound like a surfer."
50:44;50:45;"- Really?"
50:45;50:47;"- So you've definitely gotten that from your friends."
50:47;50:48;"- I'm terrified."
50:48;50:49;"I went out a few times on the board"
50:49;50:51;"and it was just, I couldn't deal with it."
50:51;50:53;"Like kind of a buffy break today."
50:53;50:55;"- I like it, I really like it."
50:55;50:59;"- Buff just means like rough, scary, messed up."
50:59;51:00;"So it could mean everything."
51:00;51:02;"- You can apply it to other situations besides the surf."
51:02;51:05;"It's like, this traffic is buff right now."
51:05;51:08;"- The words that mean, that could mean anything,"
51:08;51:11;"it's just like, why are we even talking, you know?"
51:11;51:13;"- Could mean anything, well, but it means something."
51:13;51:14;"I mean--"
51:14;51:15;"- No, that mean everything."
51:15;51:16;"- That mean everything."
51:16;51:17;"- Yeah."
51:17;51:18;"- I picked a brutal from you."
51:18;51:20;"I call everything brutal now."
51:20;51:21;"Just like--"
51:21;51:22;"- So brutal, bro."
51:22;51:24;"- When you don't have anything else to say"
51:24;51:25;"and somebody's just like, oh my God,"
51:25;51:28;"all of a sudden, just like, brutal."
51:28;51:29;"- I definitely say that a lot."
51:29;51:32;"And then also, you know, I got another friend"
51:32;51:34;"who rubs off on me a lot and he's kind of like,"
51:34;51:36;"comes from like 90s hip hop background."
51:36;51:38;"So I always call stuff ill."
51:38;51:39;"- Okay."
51:39;51:41;"- And I'm like, I wonder if I should pump the brakes"
51:41;51:41;"on that one."
51:41;51:45;"- Sick, I would say is a little less annoying than ill."
51:45;51:46;"- Like that's sick?"
51:46;51:47;"- Yeah."
51:47;51:48;"- I definitely say sick."
51:48;51:48;"- I say sick too."
51:48;51:49;"- You have some good ones, Ezra."
51:49;51:50;"You have chop it up."
51:50;51:51;"- Oh, chop it up."
51:51;51:52;"- What does that mean?"
51:52;51:53;"- Which I never use."
51:53;51:53;"- That just means to talk."
51:53;51:55;"- I like it, or hang out."
51:55;51:57;"- Yeah, like, or yeah."
51:57;51:59;"- I don't think hang out is Ezra's."
51:59;52:01;"- No, no, no, chop it up."
52:01;52:01;"Chop, chop it up."
52:01;52:03;"- Oh, it means hang out."
52:03;52:04;"Okay, I had to throw that."
52:04;52:05;"- In Norway, we say hang out."
52:05;52:06;"- Yeah, yeah."
52:06;52:07;"- I know it sounds wacky."
52:07;52:10;"It just means kicking it with your friends."
52:10;52:11;"(laughing)"
52:24;52:49;"- Okay, back to Seinfeld."
52:49;52:51;"We have Seinfeld 2000,"
52:51;52:53;"one of the premier Seinfeld accounts."
52:53;52:54;"And I just also want to say,"
52:54;52:56;"fuck all the other accounts who give this guy grief."
52:56;52:57;"- Right."
52:57;52:57;"- He's the OG."
52:57;52:58;"- Thank you."
52:58;52:59;"- OG."
52:59;53:00;"- We got Kazzy,"
53:00;53:01;"who obviously has a family connection to the program."
53:01;53:02;"And then we just got--"
53:02;53:03;"- But knows nothing."
53:03;53:04;"- That means nothing."
53:04;53:05;"And then we got me and Jake,"
53:05;53:07;"who are just two chill bros,"
53:07;53:08;"who are familiar with the show."
53:08;53:09;"- Fans of the show."
53:09;53:10;"- Fans of the show,"
53:10;53:11;"having grown up in--"
53:11;53:12;"- Not heads."
53:12;53:12;"- In America."
53:12;53:13;"Yeah, I wouldn't say a head."
53:13;53:14;"- What does that mean?"
53:14;53:15;"Is that a crew?"
53:15;53:16;"- Oh, head?"
53:16;53:17;"- Yeah."
53:17;53:19;"- Like a massive fan."
53:19;53:19;"- Okay."
53:19;53:20;"- That's a good one."
53:20;53:21;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:21;53:22;"- I like Seinfeld,"
53:22;53:23;"but I'm not a head."
53:23;53:24;"(laughing)"
53:24;53:24;"Like this--"
53:24;53:28;"- I've probably seen like 80% of the episodes."
53:28;53:29;"- You haven't seen all the episodes?"
53:29;53:30;"- I haven't seen--"
53:30;53:31;"- You know what?"
53:31;53:32;"- I haven't either."
53:32;53:32;"- Never seen the finale."
53:32;53:33;"- Yeah."
53:33;53:34;"- Never seen the finale."
53:34;53:35;"- Oh, I watched that live."
53:35;53:36;"- Yeah, me too."
53:36;53:38;"- Well, look at you guys."
53:38;53:39;"- Maybe I am a head."
53:39;53:41;"Okay, so we got Nick Weidenfeld,"
53:41;53:42;"member of the TC crew,"
53:42;53:42;"getting on the mic."
53:42;53:47;"He's going to run the Seinfeld game."
53:47;53:48;"How's this gonna work, Nick?"
53:48;53:49;"All right."
53:49;53:52;"Well, we have names for the teams."
53:52;53:53;"- Well, what are the teams?"
53:53;53:54;"Is it me and Jake versus--"
53:54;53:58;"- You and Jake versus Kazzy and Seinfeld 2000,"
53:58;54:00;"which on the surface,"
54:00;54:02;"that would seem like the winning team, right?"
54:02;54:05;"- Yeah, I'm very nervous about this"
54:05;54:07;"because I'm just not a trivia-minded person."
54:07;54:09;"My brain doesn't really work that way."
54:09;54:10;"- You're a head, dude."
54:10;54:12;"- I'm a head, but we'll see."
54:12;54:13;"We'll see what happens."
54:13;54:14;"- You'll be fine."
54:14;54:16;"I'm about to let down my entire family."
54:16;54:19;"- Seinfeld 2000 and Kazzy David,"
54:19;54:21;"you guys are the Yankees of this."
54:21;54:23;"Maybe you guys gotta be the Yankees."
54:23;54:24;"- The Yankees and the Mets, sure."
54:24;54:27;"- Yeah, I guess the Mets are like a scrappy underdog"
54:27;54:28;"compared to the Yankees."
54:28;54:29;"- I was gonna say like the Brewers."
54:29;54:31;"- Okay, we're the Brewers."
54:31;54:32;"- Twins."
54:32;54:33;"- The Yankees."
54:33;54:35;"We have the Yankees versus the Twins,"
54:35;54:37;"and the way the game's gonna be played is"
54:37;54:40;"each team is gonna get five questions."
54:40;54:42;"If you get it right, you're gonna hear this."
54:42;54:47;"If you get it wrong, you're gonna hear this."
54:47;54:50;"(drum roll)"
54:50;54:51;"- Love it."
54:51;54:54;"- If there's a tie at the end, there'll be a tiebreaker."
54:54;54:56;"And Leah, let's do a flip of the coin to see who goes first."
54:56;54:58;"Let's do a flip of the Medallion."
54:58;55:00;"- The Twins will take the top, top of the cap."
55:00;55:03;"- It's the bottom of the cap."
55:03;55:04;"- It's the Yankees."
55:04;55:04;"- Yankees."
55:04;55:08;"So the first multiple choice question,"
55:08;55:14;"Yankees, what causes George's fiancee, Susan, to die?"
55:14;55:15;"- Oh my God."
55:15;55:16;"- Poisoned envelopes."
55:16;55:17;"- Envelope, it was an envelope."
55:17;55:18;"- What a joke."
55:18;55:19;"- Toxic glue."
55:19;55:19;"(popping)"
55:19;55:20;"(laughing)"
55:20;55:22;"- I mean, we didn't even need the--"
55:22;55:24;"- Okay, that was a softball."
55:24;55:25;"Let's see what we get."
55:25;55:26;"- Twins."
55:26;55:27;"- Yeah."
55:27;55:29;"- What, in almost every episode,"
55:29;55:31;"is found on the shelf in Jerry's apartment?"
55:31;55:32;"- Cereal."
55:32;55:33;"(drum roll)"
55:33;55:36;"- Woo, all right, yeah, we don't need the multiple choice."
55:36;55:36;"- Wait, we got that wrong, or what?"
55:36;55:38;"- Wait, that was wrong."
55:38;55:39;"- Wait, oh, that was wrong?"
55:39;55:40;"(laughing)"
55:40;55:41;"- Can I take this one?"
55:41;55:42;"- Was that wrong?"
55:42;55:43;"- Wait, wait, that was wrong."
55:43;55:43;"- These are switch up."
55:43;55:44;"- That was wrong."
55:44;55:45;"(drum roll)"
55:45;55:46;"- Oh wow."
55:46;55:47;"- We got it wrong?"
55:47;55:48;"- Bottled water?"
55:48;55:48;"- Oh."
55:48;55:49;"- What was it?"
55:49;55:50;"- Superman."
55:50;55:51;"- What?"
55:51;55:52;"(popping)"
55:52;55:53;"- All right, debatable, moving on."
55:53;55:54;"- Debatable."
55:54;55:56;"- Cereal was a great answer, it was a really good answer."
55:56;55:57;"- All right, thank you."
55:57;55:58;"- Yankees."
55:58;56:01;"What was, quote, Little Jerry?"
56:01;56:03;"I know this one, do you know?"
56:03;56:04;"There's an animal?"
56:04;56:08;"It was, wasn't it a rooster?"
56:08;56:09;"(popping)"
56:09;56:11;"That's right, Kramer's pet rooster."
56:11;56:12;"- Would you have known that?"
56:12;56:13;"- Nope."
56:13;56:14;"- I forgot that."
56:14;56:16;"- What season is, do we know what season that is?"
56:16;56:19;"- I would have guessed like six?"
56:19;56:21;"- It seems like a, that's a late season."
56:21;56:23;"- Yeah, that's a late one."
56:23;56:24;"- That's like when Kramer has his head"
56:24;56:26;"on the turkey kind of situation."
56:26;56:27;"- Right, right, right."
56:27;56:29;"- All right, twins, back to you."
56:29;56:32;"- Okay, oh man, all right, we're gonna get our (beep)"
56:32;56:32;"together."
56:32;56:37;"- In the quote, Bubble Boy, what game does George"
56:37;56:39;"and Bubble Boy fight about?"
56:39;56:41;"- Oh."
56:41;56:42;"- That's a good question."
56:44;56:44;"- Is it a board game?"
56:44;56:45;"- Probably a board game."
56:45;56:46;"- Give me multiple choice."
56:46;56:47;"- Yeah."
56:47;56:50;"- You can ask for multiple choice from now on."
56:50;56:51;"- It's only a friend."
56:51;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:54;"- Okay, A, Monopoly."
56:54;56:55;"- That wasn't a move."
56:55;56:55;"- B, Uno."
56:55;56:58;"C, Trivial Pursuit."
56:58;56:59;"Or D, Go Fish."
56:59;57:03;"- They all seem possible."
57:03;57:04;"- Doesn't help."
57:04;57:09;"- Trivial Pursuit."
57:09;57:10;"- Oh yeah."
57:10;57:10;"- Nice, dude."
57:10;57:11;"- Wow."
57:11;57:15;"- They probably got in a fight about something trivial."
57:15;57:17;"- That was my thinking on that one."
57:17;57:18;"- Well done."
57:18;57:19;"- Thank you."
57:19;57:21;"- Back on the board."
57:21;57:24;"- Currently score two to one, Yankees."
57:24;57:30;"So Yankees, what does Elaine buy a lot of for Mr. Pit,"
57:30;57:33;"but doesn't get the right kind of?"
57:33;57:34;"- Mr. Pit."
57:34;57:35;"- Is it socks?"
57:35;57:38;"- Nice one."
57:38;57:39;"- It is socks."
57:39;57:40;"- Nice one, Kazzy."
57:40;57:44;"- All right, this is turning out about how one would expect."
57:44;57:45;"All right, you guys are doing well."
57:45;57:48;"- I thought these questions would be harder, to be honest."
57:48;57:49;"Anyway."
57:49;57:50;"- I didn't make up the questions."
57:50;57:50;"- That one was hard."
57:50;57:51;"I wouldn't have gotten that."
57:51;57:52;"- I wouldn't have."
57:52;57:54;"- Seinfeld 2000 is head, so."
57:54;57:55;"- Yeah."
57:55;57:55;"- Yeah."
57:55;57:59;"- I love how stressed Seinfeld was about these questions."
57:59;58:01;"- All right, twins."
58:01;58:07;"What kind of pasta does Kramer make a Jerry figurine from?"
58:07;58:08;"- Fusilli."
58:08;58:10;"- Fusilli?"
58:10;58:12;"- That is correct, it is Fusilli."
58:12;58:13;"- Clutch, dude."
58:14;58:17;"- All right, Yankees."
58:17;58:20;"What does Kramer have installed in his shower?"
58:20;58:24;"- Oh, that's a, is it a garbage disposal?"
58:24;58:24;"- It is."
58:24;58:26;"- Wow."
58:26;58:27;"- In his shower?"
58:27;58:28;"- It's a very funny episode."
58:28;58:31;"- It's an episode where he wants to eat in his shower."
58:31;58:32;"- Okay."
58:32;58:33;"- Is that the one where George Eastern says?"
58:33;58:36;"- So he has a garbage disposal inside his shower,"
58:36;58:36;"and I think."
58:36;58:38;"- To save time, right?"
58:38;58:38;"- To save time."
58:38;58:40;"- You know what, actually, I haven't watched all of Seinfeld."
58:40;58:41;"Maybe I never."
58:41;58:44;"Next time we're doing Curb, 'cause I would shred at that."
58:44;58:45;"- Yeah, I would shred at that, too."
58:45;58:46;"- I would shred at Curb."
58:46;58:49;"- I haven't seen the last two seasons of Seinfeld."
58:49;58:50;"- Wow."
58:50;58:52;"- Maybe we'll, you know what, maybe that's what we'll do."
58:52;58:53;"Well, there's not gonna be a bonus."
58:53;58:55;"- Oh, those are the weird seasons, though."
58:55;58:57;"The show kinda goes off the rails a little bit."
58:57;58:59;"- So just out of familial pride, you were like,"
58:59;59:01;"""I don't need to watch these last two seasons."""
59:01;59:02;"- Yeah, I mean, he didn't watch them,"
59:02;59:03;"so I was like, ""Why would I watch them?"""
59:03;59:04;"- Not canon."
59:04;59:05;"- Wow."
59:05;59:06;"- They don't count."
59:06;59:08;"- Not canon."
59:08;59:08;"- Twins."
59:08;59:12;"In one episode, what does Jerry say"
59:12;59:14;"his girlfriend's laugh sounds like?"
59:14;59:18;"- We're gonna need multiple choice for this."
59:18;59:20;"- I don't know this one."
59:20;59:22;"- A, Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer."
59:22;59:24;"B, Jake's Home Depot playlist."
59:24;59:28;"C, a snorting pig."
59:28;59:29;"D, a monkey with a flu."
59:29;59:31;"- Wanna say Jake's Home Depot playlist,"
59:31;59:33;"but I feel like that's not it."
59:33;59:34;"Just the timeline doesn't work out on that one."
59:34;59:35;"- What was the first one?"
59:35;59:38;"- The first one is Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer."
59:38;59:39;"- I think that's it."
59:39;59:41;"- All right, let's go for it."
59:41;59:43;"- Hey!"
59:43;59:45;"- I don't even know what that means, though."
59:45;59:46;"- You know what Elmer Fudd?"
59:46;59:48;"- What does the juicer do to the voice?"
59:48;59:51;"- I guess his buttocks would be shredded"
59:51;59:53;"into a bloody pulp by the juicer,"
59:53;59:55;"so it would be some kind of agonizing."
59:55;59:58;"(laughing)"
59:58;59:59;"That's actually a really gnar image."
59:59;01:00:02;"You should have a word with your father about that."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"I don't think that's appropriate for NBC must see TV."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"I'm gonna write a letter."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"So this is game point for them."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- This is game point."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"That is correct."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"(clears throat)"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"- Yankees, what is one surefire way"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"to open up Elaine's vault?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- I don't know."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"- I know it."
01:00:20;01:00:21;"- Oh, you know?"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"- That's all you."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"- It's the alcohol, right?"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"It's the schnapps, the peach schnapps?"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"- That is right."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"- Okay."
01:00:28;01:00:31;"- Is vault a code word for her vagina?"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"- Yeah, the secrets that she keeps."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"(laughing)"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"- Or is it like her actual vault?"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- No, no, no, it's the secrets that she keeps."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- It's like her mental vault."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- It's everything she knows."
01:00:38;01:00:38;"- Oh, no, okay."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"She says that I don't tell secrets."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"- That's right."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"- It's a vault, but then the key to the vault"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"is peach schnapps."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"- Okay."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"- That's right."
01:00:46;01:00:46;"- The question was a little ambiguous."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- Twins, we're gonna give you one more."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"If you get this, we're gonna go even,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"and we'll tie and have a tiebreaker."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"What did Kramer call the fragrance"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"that Calvin Klein stole from him?"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"I'll give you multiple choice."
01:00:56;01:01:00;"The ocean, the breeze, the beach,"
01:01:00;01:01:03;"the bread absconder."
01:01:03;01:01:07;"- Ah, okay."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"The ocean, the breeze."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"I wanna say the ocean."
01:01:10;01:01:11;"- Man, I don't know."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Do you have any idea, Jake?"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- No."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- I'm gonna go with the beach."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"Nice."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"(laughing)"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Great Leonardo DiCaprio film."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- Well done."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"- Okay."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"- All right, it's a tiebreaker."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"The closest team to this answer is going to win."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"What was the exact date of the first ever airing"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"of Seinfeld on TV?"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"- October. - October."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"- October. - October 3rd, '89."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- I know it's '89."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- I think it was October."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"- I think it was like June, right, though?"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"'Cause wasn't the show supposed to be like a summer--"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- You should know 'cause you should be like"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"posting an Instagram on that."
01:01:43;01:01:44;"- You're ahead, right?"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"- I think she's gonna be right, yeah."
01:01:46;01:01:46;"- A real head would know."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"- I'm gonna really need an A now."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"I'm gonna need a final answer."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"- October 3rd, '89."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"- I'm with it."
01:01:54;01:01:54;"- We're locking you in."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- Okay. - October 3rd, '89."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"All right."
01:01:57;01:02:02;"- Oh, the exact date, I'm gonna say June 12th, '89?"
01:02:02;01:02:07;"- The answer is July 5th, 1989."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Is it like the Price is Right"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"where you get the closest person?"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- You win, you win."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"- You win."
01:02:12;01:02:12;"- Wow. - Okay."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- And well done."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"- Seinfeld cred."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Just imagine that, man."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"July '89, George H.W. Bush is president."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"You just went to a barbecue."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"You got (beep) faced with your boys."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"Lying on the couch hungover on July 5th."
01:02:28;01:02:31;"Turn it over to NBC."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"Catch a quirky new sitcom."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"(imitates music)"
01:02:36;01:02:41;"Immediately, you're taken by the rhythm of the bass line"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"and how the tempo matches Jerry's cadence."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"We had the composer of the Seinfeld theme song on once."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"- I actually heard about that."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- And you're just like, what is this?"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"And then it opens."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"- You got a real wry sensibility."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- And just two guys chopping it up in a diner."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"- This is a very self-conscious sitcom."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- And you're like, you know what, man?"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"It's 1989, but I honestly feel like"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"I'm witnessing the beginning of the coming decade."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"(explosion)"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"(laughter)"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- All right, let's get into the top five."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"Kazzy, will you join us for the top five?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- Yes."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"- It's time for the top five."
01:03:14;01:03:18;"Five on iTunes."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"- Today on the top five, we're gonna be comparing"
01:03:20;01:03:24;"the top five iTunes songs right now in 2017"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"with the top five Billboard hits of 1989."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- This week, '89."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"- This week in '89."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Kazzy, does '89 mean much to you"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"outside of the launch of Seinfeld?"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- No, I'm just curious, obviously these songs"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"are gonna be different."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"How are we supposed to compare songs that are so different?"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- This is the backbone of this entire show."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"I mean, yeah, we listen to the number five song from 1989"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"and then we listen to the number five song from today."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"- And then you're like, yeah, they're different."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"- We compare and contrast."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Yeah, sometimes we're like, wow, that one,"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"the first one really sounded like it was from 1989."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Whereas the second had this more modern, current 2017 feel."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"You know, that's one thing you might say."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"- Yeah, okay. (laughing)"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"- Sometimes there's weird parallels."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- Sometimes there's weird parallels."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"- Lyrically or--"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"- Okay, I'm excited, yeah."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- And then sometimes we just kind of imagine"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"what it was like, you know, similar to the guy"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"who was hung over after the Fourth of July"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"and happened to catch the first episode of Seinfeld."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"You can kind of imagine what was happening in 1989."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"So you were not alive."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"- I was not."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"- I was 12."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- I was five."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"This is gonna mean something different to all of us."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"- This is a nice range here."
01:04:28;01:04:31;"- Yeah, so the number five song this week in 1989"
01:04:31;01:04:34;"is Naina Cherry, ""Buffalo Steps."""
01:04:34;01:04:35;"Good song. - Great song."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"- Do you know this song? - No."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"- Is she the daughter of--"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"- Don Cherry, the jazz musician."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"- Right, I thought so."

01:08:08;01:08:10;"- This just feels like not,"

01:08:13;01:08:15;"You wouldn't really listen to this in the car."

01:17:43;01:17:44;"- Right."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"- Like that was my young age."
01:17:46;01:17:50;"- So One Direction, did you like it in a kind of chill way,"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"or you were just like, this is not for me?"

01:18:01;01:18:03;"- And are you interested in their solo careers?"
01:18:03;01:18:07;"- No, but I'm pushing for Harry to be the best,"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"better than Zayn,"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"because Zayn kind of bothers me for some reason."

01:18:12;01:18:14;"- I think it's worth getting into this for a second."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"Why, why does Zayn bother you?"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"- I just feel like Harry was always the one"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"that was supposed to go solo first,"
01:18:20;01:18:25;"and then Zayn like sneakily like did some, I don't know,"

01:18:39;01:18:40;"- Yeah, I think he's cool,"
01:18:40;01:18:41;"but isn't his song kind of like,"
01:18:41;01:18:44;"isn't it a copy of something?"

01:18:54;01:18:57;"- But Pillow Talk is again, it's like a bed sheet body."

01:22:47;01:22:49;"also have babies."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Oh my God."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Wait, no, that guy isn't solo yet."
01:22:52;01:22:53;"- That's Liam."
01:22:53;01:22:55;"He just dropped his first single, but he has a baby."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"- How's the single?"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"- It's not great."
01:22:58;01:23:00;"It's not in the top five, as we can see."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"But I really like that all these other guys"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"are racing each other to release their singles."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"And whereas Liam had a baby with Cheryl Cole,"
01:23:08;01:23:11;"who used to be one of my favorite British pop stars."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"- Oh, (beep)"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"I don't know who that is."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"- I don't know that, yeah, that's crazy."
01:23:15;01:23:16;"- Good for him."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"- That's great."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"- He linked up with a single mom,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"10 years older than him, had a baby with her."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"These guys are out, you know, grinding in the studio."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"He's becoming a father."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Good for him."
01:23:26;01:23:27;"- Pretty dope."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"- Out of everything produced by Solo One Direction,"
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Liam's baby is the best thing that came out of it."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"It's better than any Harry's tasteful palate."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"It's better than Slow Hans."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"- I just feel like if you were in a boy band"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"with five guys and you see these guys in this arms race,"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"who's gonna be solo first?"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Wouldn't you wanna be the guy who's like,"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"""I'm gonna have a baby with Cheryl Cole."""
01:23:48;01:23:48;"- So much cooler."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"- And give it like 10 years."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"- Yeah."
01:23:51;01:23:52;"- It's so weird because, yeah."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"- Liam's gonna drop a cool singer-songwriter record"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"in like seven years."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"- He did drop one single already, featuring Quavo."
01:23:59;01:24:03;"It wasn't what I was hoping for, but whatever."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"I like that he's taking his time."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"- Yeah."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"You think it's weird though, like,"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"what else are they gonna do?"
01:24:09;01:24:10;"They're obviously gonna go solo."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"There's nothing else for them to do."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"But it's still annoying, like,"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"""Oh yeah, you're gonna go solo?"""
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Like, obviously."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"But it's, why wouldn't they?"
01:24:18;01:24:18;"- Yeah, you know."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"- They just kinda have to, right?"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"- Yeah, what else are they gonna do?"
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- No, but they're singers."
01:24:21;01:24:22;"- They don't have to."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"All these guys are worth,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"well, I don't know what kind of deal they had."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"I'm guessing they all have at least like 30 mil."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"- Jeez."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"- Yeah, they definitely do."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"- That's a lot of money, Ezra."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"- I know, I know."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"Of course it's a lot."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- That's a crazy amount of money."
01:24:35;01:24:35;"I'm actually surprised by that."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"- They're like the biggest band in the world for a while."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"Okay, let's say all these guys--"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"- I thought bands didn't make any money anymore."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- They definitely made a lot of money."
01:24:43;01:24:45;"- These guys are going around the world"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"playing stadiums, massive."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"So, let's say each of these guys has, I don't know, 20 mil."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Oh, actually, now Nick's showing us,"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"maybe they're worth 50 mil."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"I'm just saying it'd be interesting"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"if one of those guys was like,"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"""You know what, I got 50 mil."
01:24:59;01:25:02;"""I'm gonna open up like a sandwich,"

01:25:03;01:25:04;"that they should do,"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"but I wanna think of something else they would be good at."
01:25:07;01:25:09;"- Maybe you should invite one of them"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"to intern on your web series."
01:25:11;01:25:13;"- Yeah, they would have a really good time."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"- Maybe some of them can act."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"- I'm literally the intern on my web series."
01:25:16;01:25:18;"Like, that's how low budget it is."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"- You're your own intern."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"- Like, I'm going to pick up the equipment."
01:25:21;01:25:23;"- Dude, let's have Liam call in."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"- Let's see if we can get Liam."
01:25:24;01:25:25;"- The baby."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"- Let's see if we can get a single member of one date."
01:25:27;01:25:28;"- Yeah."
01:25:28;01:25:31;"'Cause I bet one of them is a Vampire Weekend head."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"I bet one of them is."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"That would be real bad if none of them are."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"- So, listeners of Time Crisis,"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"if no one from One Direction ever calls in,"
01:25:39;01:25:39;"that means they all hate Vampire Weekend."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"- I'm trying to think of like any,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"nah, I've never heard of Through the Grapevine."
01:25:45;01:25:48;"It wouldn't be hard to get in touch with some of these guys."
01:25:48;01:25:50;"We got plenty of connections to them."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"- I'd like to have the guy that does the Don Hen,"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Nile, call in."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Let's see if we can get Nile."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- You guys can totally get Nile."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"- Talk Henley with him."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"- That's like, that's easy."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"- Let's talk Eagles with Nile."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"That'd be tight."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"- I think if we came to him respectfully"
01:26:03;01:26:06;"and we were like, Nile, no gotcha journalism."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"We just wanna talk to you about your love"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"of early Don Henley."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"- No, let's just talk Eagles."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"- Just talking Eagles."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"- I don't wanna talk about you."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"I just wanna talk about the Eagles."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"- Yeah."
01:26:15;01:26:18;"And maybe we ask him about the other guys."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- No, I don't even know who they are."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"I could care less."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"- I think it's like in their contracts"
01:26:21;01:26:24;"they don't talk about the other ones."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- Oh, really?"
01:26:25;01:26:25;"- I've never even heard One Direction."
01:26:25;01:26:26;"- I assume so."
01:26:26;01:26:27;"- That'd be smart."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"Okay, I like this idea."
01:26:31;01:26:33;"Let's get Nile on the phone talking Eagles."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- I feel like Nile,"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Jake can't name a single One Direction song."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"So it's so chill."
01:26:38;01:26:39;"- No, no, no, but you can't."
01:26:39;01:26:42;"See Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake."
01:26:42;01:26:43;"- You can't even mention One Direction."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Let's just talk Eagles."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"- But you gotta be respectful"
01:26:46;01:26:46;"'cause you gotta understand."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- No, I am respectful."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"- No, no, no, these are young men"
01:26:49;01:26:54;"who they know that you're looking at them"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"and you're like, these guys have got 50 mil each."
01:26:56;01:26:56;"- No, I'm not."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"- And you're like, these guys are untouchable."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"But in their minds, they're a little insecure"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"about like, do grown men respect their music?"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"- No, that's not the vibe I'm bringing, man."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"I don't think of them as untouchable."
01:27:07;01:27:10;"What I'm saying is I'm not a fan."

01:27:15;01:27:18;"and like thought these guys were like amazing rock stars,"

01:27:20;01:27:25;"What I'm saying is, man to man, let's just talk Eagles."
01:27:25;01:27:28;"- Okay, so just don't lead with the I'm not a fan part."
01:27:30;01:27:32;"Maybe just don't air this conversation"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"and you'll have a good chance."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"- That's a good idea."
01:27:36;01:27:39;"I think you just guaranteed that it will be aired though."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"All right, let's go back to 1989."

01:31:09;01:31:11;"- Do you think Bieber writes his lyrics?"
01:31:11;01:31:12;"- No."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"- No."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"He should work with a different lyricist."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"In fact, Justin Bieber's not even credited"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"as the songwriter on this."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"- That's so funny."
01:31:20;01:31:24;"- So Jake, this song is gonna be on DJ Khaled's"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"fourth coming album."
01:31:25;01:31:26;"You know what the album's called?"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"- No."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"- Grateful."
01:31:28;01:31:31;"- That's so classic, bro."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"- Jake's a big Grateful Dead fan."
01:31:33;01:31:33;"- Huge."
01:31:33;01:31:36;"- Grateful Dead's just in the atmosphere right now."
01:31:36;01:31:36;"- Oh wow."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"- That picture is so cute."
01:31:38;01:31:39;"- That's a great picture."
01:31:39;01:31:40;"- It's such a good cover."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"- You're a fan of his son?"
01:31:42;01:31:43;"- I didn't know it was his son,"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"and I saw that picture and I was like, that's so cute."
01:31:46;01:31:50;"But if you just imagine the placement of that happening."
01:31:50;01:31:51;"- I mean, trying to get that picture"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"is such a different experience."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- No, that's a really good point."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"I'm sure you've thought about this a lot,"
01:31:55;01:31:58;"'cause your show is a lot about social media and stuff."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"You see an image on Instagram,"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"and actually another one of the episodes"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"was kind of all about you trying to get somebody"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"to post a picture to make a point to your ex-boyfriend."
01:32:06;01:32:09;"And it's funny, you could see a picture"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"and just take it at face value and be like, that's so cute."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"Look at this gorgeous little baby in a pool."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"And then if you take it one step deeper,"
01:32:17;01:32:21;"you're imagining parents of a three-month-old baby"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"placing him in a pool."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"- Please put your arms up."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"- Putting his arms down and being like,"
01:32:26;01:32:27;"hey, chill, chill, chill."
01:32:27;01:32:28;"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
01:32:28;01:32:29;"- With the photo lights."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"- Yeah, bright lights on the baby."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"- So when the bubble's going and the--"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"- Yeah."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"- Also, okay, I know they had to get the picture,"
01:32:38;01:32:41;"but, and I've never been a parent,"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"but I feel like babies in pools"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"seems like a really stressful situation."
01:32:47;01:32:48;"I mean, it's really brutal."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"You hear these horrible stories."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"You know, even OJ's daughter in Brentwood,"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"he lost a child drowning in a pool."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"It's awful. - Really?"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"- Yeah, it's awful. - What?"
01:32:56;01:32:56;"- It's awful."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"I'm not trying to bring down the whole vibe here."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"- No, man. - I'm just saying--"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"- My whole day is ruined, honestly."
01:33:00;01:33:03;"- It's super stressful, pools and kids."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"Like, I understand, right, Nick, you're a parent, right?"
01:33:05;01:33:06;"That's stressful."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"- It makes me think of that Nirvana cover."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"- Yeah, you see, exactly."
01:33:10;01:33:14;"- And that kid is probably like 25 now, 26."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"- I feel like every year he pops up, they're like--"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"- The kid has gotten so much publicity."
01:33:18;01:33:19;"- I don't even know."
01:33:19;01:33:20;"- Yeah, just for that."
01:33:20;01:33:23;"- It's always like, it's the 19th anniversary of,"
01:33:23;01:33:26;"never mind, let's catch up with the kid."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"It's the 21st and a half anniversary."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"Let's catch up with the kid."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"- We have different internet."
01:33:31;01:33:34;"- No, I've seen that so much."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"I've been like, I'm so sick of this."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"- He recreates the picture every year."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"- Does he really? - Yeah."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"- Oh my God."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"- I don't know. - Okay."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"- I'm just saying, babies--"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"- I feel embarrassed bringing it up."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"- Babies in pools is stressful."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"- It's so stressful."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"And you just like, everyone knows at least one story."
01:33:52;01:33:52;"- Right. - Yeah, some horrible story."
01:33:52;01:33:56;"- But I'm wondering about DJ Khaled."
01:33:56;01:33:59;"I mean, you put a baby in a pool."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"- Of course it's safe."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"There's nothing that's gonna happen."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I'm not trying to put him on blast."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"- I'm not worried about the kid."
01:34:03;01:34:07;"What I'm saying is, how can you not think about Nirvana?"
01:34:07;01:34:08;"I mean, that's like-- - With the kid in the pool."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"- One of the most iconic covers ever."
01:34:10;01:34:12;"- Oh, well that's because Nirvana's less culturally relevant"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"than DJ Khaled in 2017, Jake."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"Is that fair enough to say as a younger millennial?"
01:34:17;01:34:18;"- Well, I mean--"
01:34:18;01:34:22;"- No, I would just say that he is above water in the art."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"So just because there's water in it,"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"similar to the Seinfeld friends, you know?"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"- Right. - Your argument--"
01:34:29;01:34:30;"- There's a lot in common,"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"but they're very different shows."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"- Yes."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"- And maybe Jake, in your opinion,"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"DJ Khaled's album cover is the friends of the situation."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"- The baby looks so hood in this cover,"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"it's like nothing like it, almost."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"- It's a very different vibe."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"- Different atmosphere. - Different tonally."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"- Very tonally different."
01:34:45;01:34:47;"The number one song this week in 19--"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"- Damn it."
01:34:48;01:34:52;"- What, Jake, it's the changing of the guard, man."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Kurt's gone, dude, 20 years."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"- Kurt's gone, Jerry's gone."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"- Jerry's gone, man, 2017."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"- Dude, Kurt and Jerry died in consecutive years,"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"that's a rough run."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"- And then Tupac and Biggie."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"They're all gone, man."
01:35:08;01:35:12;"All we got now is Niall and Justin, deal."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"Justin is Jerry, Niall's Kurt."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"It is what it is, man."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"- That's such a sad thought."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"- Okay, you know what, Jake?"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Next time Niall Horan comes to town,"
01:35:22;01:35:25;"you and me are gonna take a tab of acid each"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"and just take it all in, man."
01:35:27;01:35:28;"It's gonna be fun."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"- In."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"- Hundred."
01:35:31;01:35:34;"- The number, what was it, ""Hundo P""?"
01:35:34;01:35:34;"- ""Hundo P""."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"- ""Hundo P"", my man, ""Hundo P""."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"The number one song this week in 1989."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Do you know ""New Kids on the Block""?"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"- Yeah."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"- Do you know ""New Kids on the Block""?"
01:35:44;01:35:45;"- Of course."
01:35:45;01:35:48;"- Boy bands, there's always a boy band."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"- Will there always be boy bands, though?"
01:35:49;01:35:50;"- Write stuff, hang tough."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"- You know, that's a good question."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"By the time ""One Direction"" came out,"
01:35:53;01:35:54;"it almost seemed like--"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"- It was weird."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"- It was like people were like,"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"""We don't need boy bands anymore."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"We got Justin Bieber, we have--"""
01:36:00;01:36:03;"- Well, I think the double of the Backstreet Boys"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"and NSYNC kinda killed it."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"- It was too much, yeah."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"- Too much at one time."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"- I didn't know this song."
01:36:11;01:36:16;"- Again, a less than tasteful palette, I would say."
01:36:16;01:36:17;"- I love the use of palette."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"It's so hilarious. - That's a long-running thing."
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Would you consider this a tasteful palette?"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"- I don't even know what that means."
01:36:25;01:36:28;"- Well, the thing is, Jake loves the tasteful palette"
01:36:28;01:36:32;"of, say, 1970s rock, like the Eagles or something."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"- Warm tones."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"- Where's Jake?"
01:36:35;01:36:36;"- I like it warm."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"- Organic."
01:36:37;01:36:37;"- Yeah."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"- It's very non-aggressive."
01:36:38;01:36:42;"- Whereas Jake finds the Chainsmokers palette to be--"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"- Brittle, acidic."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"- Not tasteful. - Dystopian."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"- Dystopian."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"(laughing)"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"- That's incredible."
01:36:48;01:36:53;"Their last, Chainsmokers' last song, ""Horrendous."""
01:36:53;01:36:56;"Paris is the worst song I've ever heard in my life."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"- What's it called?"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"- ""Gone in Paris to get away from your parents."""
01:36:59;01:37:00;"- Oh my God."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"- Okay, here's the question."
01:37:02;01:37:03;"- Hold on, keep the new kids going."
01:37:03;01:37:03;"I wanna--"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"- I don't--"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"- Sorry, I--"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"- No, no, no, no, no, I wanna see where it goes."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"This is the most mild music."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"- And also, it's worth pointing out,"
01:37:11;01:37:13;"""New Kids on the Block"" was basically,"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"so you know, Bobby Brown was a new addition."
01:37:15;01:37:15;"- Right."
01:37:15;01:37:20;"- Which was a group of all black tweens,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"and ""New Kids on the Block"" was all white tweens,"
01:37:22;01:37:25;"and I'm pretty sure they're both from Boston."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"- I thought ""New Additions,"" really?"
01:37:27;01:37:28;"- No, no."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"- Okay, my bad."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"- Maybe bringing the boys to men."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"- My bad."
01:37:31;01:37:31;"- ""New Additions"" was also from Boston."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"And basically, ""New Kids on the Block"""
01:37:34;01:37:36;"was somebody looking at ""New Addition"""
01:37:36;01:37:38;"and saying, ""I'm gonna make a white version of that."""
01:37:38;01:37:40;"- Yikes."
01:37:40;01:37:41;"- And they did."
01:37:41;01:37:46;"We don't need to keep, this song is nothing."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"The new kids had a couple gems, but not that one."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"- When did Mark Wahlberg last listen to that song?"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"- Well, Mark Wahlberg was not in it."
01:37:54;01:37:54;"His brother Donny."
01:37:54;01:37:55;"- I know, dude."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Oh, I know."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"- I could imagine he had Donny over for a barbecue,"
01:38:00;01:38:03;"and he said to his wife, ""Put that 'New Kids' ballad"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"""on the Sonos."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"""I wanna bust Donny's balls."""
01:38:07;01:38:09;"- Summer of 2009."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"- Yeah, July 4th, 2009."
01:38:12;01:38:14;"Donny was like--"
01:38:14;01:38:16;"- Everyone's sober."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"- Everyone's sober."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"- They're drinking."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- They're drinking O'Doul's."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Donny's like, ""Hey, put on that new Kanye."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"""I like Kanye."

01:38:28;01:38:30;"""One second, Donny, I'll put on some Kanye."""
01:38:30;01:38:33;"And he says to his wife, ""But I'll be loving you forever"

01:38:35;01:38:39;"And then Donny's like, ""Wait, wait, what's this?"
01:38:39;01:38:40;"""Oh my God."
01:38:40;01:38:43;"""Still busting my balls, Mark, for all these years."""
01:38:43;01:38:47;"The number one song."
01:38:47;01:38:53;"In 2017, increasingly it seems that this song"
01:38:53;01:38:56;"is gonna define the summer."
01:38:56;01:38:57;"The first summer of Trump."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"I guess we could say there's some poetic justice"
01:38:59;01:39:01;"in that the first summer of Trump,"
01:39:01;01:39:04;"we have a mostly Spanish language song."
01:39:04;01:39:07;"That's cool."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"- Desperado?"
01:39:08;01:39:08;"- That's awesome."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"- No, Despacito."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"And okay, so Kazzy, you were saying before,"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Justin got in trouble."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"What's the story?"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"- He was singing in a club."
01:39:16;01:39:19;"They gave him the mic to sing Despacito."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"And then he started to sing it."
01:39:21;01:39:23;"And then once it got to the Spanish verse,"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"he was like, ""La, la, la, la, la, la, la, burrito."""
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Like, it was so, it's so bad."
01:39:28;01:39:31;"Like, you watch it and you just can't stop laughing."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"It's like really bad."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"- And also, you know--"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"- So he just didn't remember the Spanish."
01:39:36;01:39:36;"He like--"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"- No, he knows no Spanish."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"- He just never knew them."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"- But I thought he sang in Spanish in the song."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"- No, no, no, he sings in English."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"- No, he sings in Spanish."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"- So this was, I think also the fact that people,"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"yeah, people were like,"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"Justin could have been--"
01:39:51;01:39:51;"- Great song."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"- You're in?"
01:39:53;01:39:54;"- Yeah, I'm in."
01:39:54;01:39:55;"- Okay, cool."
01:39:57;01:40:02;"- The king's English, man."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"- I think it switches."
01:40:03;01:40:06;"- I think he sings in Spanish, but he just learned it."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"He coached up."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"- He says one word in Spanish, the title of the song."
01:40:10;01:40:11;"- Okay."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"- That's not true."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"- Wait, what else does he say in Spanish?"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"- I think we need to listen."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"I remember him speaking Spanish in this."
01:40:18;01:40:21;"- So what's he supposed to do, though, in the club"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"when the Spanish part comes up?"
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- What he did."
01:40:26;01:40:32;"- That's not Justin, though, obviously."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"As a professional musician, I can tell you guys,"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"that's not Justin singing anymore."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"I believe that's really Fonsi."
01:40:37;01:40:40;"- I think the chorus is more than that."
01:40:40;01:40:43;"The video's hilarious."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"- That's Justin."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"Oh, he's doubling the guy."
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Okay, you guys are right."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"The problem is that we wanna believe"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"that people from different countries can come together"
01:41:02;01:41:06;"to do hot remixes to become the songs of the summer,"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"and we wanna believe that there's mutual respect happening."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"I don't know, so just making jokes about,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"I guess he kept saying the phrase Dorito"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"when he was singing."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- Yeah."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"- That's some juvenile 22-year-old humor."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"- He wasn't joking."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"I think it was the only thing he could think of"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"that ended in O."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"- And as we know, Doritos are an American product,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"so it's not even."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"- Frito-Lay."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"- Do you think this is the song of the summer, though?"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"- It seems like we have no choice."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Is this your song of the summer?"
01:41:37;01:41:40;"- I thought ""Slide"" was gonna be the song of the summer."
01:41:40;01:41:41;"- What's that?"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Oh, Calvin Harris?"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- ""Slide's"" pretty cool."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"- No, it's too cool to be the song of the summer."
01:41:46;01:41:46;"- Too cool?"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"- I like the other one with Ariana Grande, too."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Is that what that's called?"
01:41:49;01:41:49;"- Which one?"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"- It's called ""Heat Wave"" or something."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Oh, I haven't heard that."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"- ""Despacito"" is the song of the summer."
01:41:55;01:41:57;"There's nothing that any of us can do about it."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"- It's been number one for a few weeks."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"- It's been number one."
01:42:00;01:42:00;"It's the song of the summer."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"- It's still early in the summer."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"- It's true."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"- It could change."
01:42:05;01:42:09;"""Lean On,"" was that not the song of the summer?"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"- It kinda was the song of the summer."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"- I guess it's different as a top one"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"and in your mind what really the song of the summer is."
01:42:15;01:42:18;"- As I get older, the summer means nothing to me."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Maybe just 'cause I've been in LA so much."
01:42:20;01:42:22;"It's like when people talk about it's June"
01:42:22;01:42:25;"and it's the beginning of summer."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"Who cares?"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"- I was back in DC last weekend."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"It felt like summer."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"- Just that humid East Coast?"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"- Oh yeah."
01:42:34;01:42:37;"- So now that you're out of college,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"does summer mean anything to you?"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"And you live in Los Angeles?"
01:42:41;01:42:44;"- This is my second summer since college."
01:42:44;01:42:47;"So I haven't really gotten there yet."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"Summer still is feeling like summer."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"- This is exciting."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"It's exciting that it's summer."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"- Yeah."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"- And when I was 23,"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"did I still get excited about the summer?"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"- I don't ever really get excited about anything,"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"but it's like, oh, summer."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"- But once or twice this summer,"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"you're gonna call up everybody,"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"jump in the car, go to Sweet Rose, blast ""Despacito."""
01:43:08;01:43:09;"- Totally."
01:43:09;01:43:09;"- That's gonna happen."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"- That's in my future, yes."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"- Do you go to clubs and dance?"
01:43:12;01:43:16;"- Like once a year and then I'm always like,"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"I'm never doing that again."
01:43:18;01:43:20;"And then the next year I'll forget."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- And do you hold things in your hand?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"'Cause this is something we were talking about."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"- Yeah, I'm like, will hold like-"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"- Double fists?"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"- That would be even more comfortable."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"I really try not to smoke."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"And when I'm like out, I just like, can't not do it."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"I feel so embarrassed to even be out somewhere"
01:43:36;01:43:37;"that I have to be doing something."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"- Do you smoke cigarettes at the club?"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"- I really try not to."
01:43:39;01:43:42;"- You can't smoke in the club though, can you?"
01:43:42;01:43:42;"- No."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- Maybe, I don't know, maybe you go underground."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"- I do sometimes, yeah."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"- Okay, so you're at the club feeling uncomfortable"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"'cause you don't like to dance at the club."
01:43:49;01:43:49;"- Yeah."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"- And out of discomfort, you got a cigarette,"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"lit cigarette in your mouth."
01:43:52;01:43:53;"- And a drink."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"- And a drink in each hand."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"- And I hate doing both those things."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"- And you're just kind of swaying or you're doing moves?"
01:43:59;01:44:03;"- Yeah, I mean, sometimes I'll take a Xanax"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"if I have to go out."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Whoa."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"- Yeah, so I can just do it,"
01:44:07;01:44:11;"pretend to be someone else for a night."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"So I get sometimes comfortable enough"
01:44:13;01:44:16;"to dance like the other girls."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"- Right."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"- Yeah, but it's an embarrassing sight."
01:44:20;01:44:24;"Like if you walk in there sober, you're like, what is this?"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"What are we all doing?"
01:44:25;01:44:29;"- I feel like I need to definitely be like lit as they say."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"- Where are the clubs in LA?"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"- Like West Hollywood?"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- I don't even know."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"- Nice guy, Bootsy Bellows."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"- Are they on Sunset in West Hollywood?"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"- Bootsy Bellows is on Sunset, but it's like--"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"- Bootsy is so cracking, it's like--"
01:44:42;01:44:45;"- That's like a models and bottles, like club, club, like--"
01:44:45;01:44:46;"- Billionaire is like--"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"- Everyone has extensions, like everyone's naked."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Not actually naked, but--"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"- So, okay, okay, so--"
01:44:52;01:44:53;"- And that's also--"
01:44:53;01:44:54;"- Can I just roll in there?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"Or is it the kind of thing that--"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"- You honestly, like, it's so hard to get in."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"I couldn't get in one time, the only time I went,"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"and it was so embarrassing."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"And then everyone's just waiting outside"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"'cause they all--"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"- Oh, because they let your friends in?"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"- Tried to go in, yeah."
01:45:08;01:45:10;"- Is it just based on a, is it like a TV show?"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Is it like Sex and the City where it's like,"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"there's a guy that's like judging you,"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"and then you can't get in?"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"- I think it's like, it's at the point"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"where you need a connection to someone"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"who has a table inside to get in the club."
01:45:21;01:45:21;"- I got two questions."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Did you consider dropping your father's name?"
01:45:23;01:45:26;"And if you did, even if the guy was like,"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"just imagine like the guy at the door is a huge Curb fan,"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"and he's like, ""That's awesome, I love Curb."
01:45:31;01:45:34;"""I don't see the connection between coming"
01:45:34;01:45:35;"""to Bootsy Bellas."""
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Yeah, yeah."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"- Yeah, no, I would literally never do that."
01:45:38;01:45:41;"But one time my friend literally was like,"
01:45:41;01:45:43;"dropped it without asking,"
01:45:43;01:45:46;"even though I don't know why you would even ever do that."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"And they were like, ""I have no idea who the (beep) that is."
01:45:49;01:45:50;"""Like, please."""
01:45:50;01:45:51;"It was so, it was too funny."
01:45:51;01:45:55;"- No, because the truth is you can strike out big league"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"when you drop a name because--"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"- You're really putting yourself out there."
01:45:59;01:46:00;"- You're really putting yourself out there."
01:46:00;01:46:00;"- It's awkward, it's awkward."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"- It is so awful."
01:46:01;01:46:03;"- 'Cause also you're making an assumption"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"about the other person that even if you drop"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"like a sick name, like a great name"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"of a talented, amazing person--"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"- Dr. Dre."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"- Dr. Dre, you're also making the assumption--"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"- I'm rolling up in a polar fleece."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"- Yeah."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"- Because maybe that person is just like deeply--"
01:46:18;01:46:19;"- 40 year old white guy."
01:46:19;01:46:20;"- In Gallatin."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"- But being what you're saying is like,"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"you're saying like, it's the most--"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"- Honestly, I feel like this probably happened"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"on Curb Your Enthusiasm."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"It's also like you try to drop a name"
01:46:27;01:46:28;"because maybe the person says,"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"""I'm really sorry, we're full."""
01:46:30;01:46:32;"And then you say, ""Well, blah, blah, blah."""
01:46:32;01:46:34;"And then they might, if it's very possible,"
01:46:34;01:46:35;"they might be like, ""That's great."
01:46:35;01:46:36;"""But as I said, we're full."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"""What are you trying to do here?"""
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I mean, I don't know, what are you gonna say?"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- I'm on Time Crisis."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"(static)"
01:46:41;01:46:46;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:46:46;01:46:50;"- What's a cover at a club like that?"
01:46:50;01:46:51;"- What do you mean, the cover?"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"- Like the cover charge."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- I think there is no cover."
01:46:53;01:46:53;"- Oh, no, no, no, there's no cover."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"- Probably not for women, right?"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"- Yeah, I know."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"- Maybe for guys."
01:46:57;01:46:58;"- What about?"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"(laughing)"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Well, because they make all their money"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"from bottle service, yeah."
01:47:01;01:47:03;"- What if you and I just tried to go to this club?"
01:47:03;01:47:04;"What's it called?"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"- Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:05;01:47:07;"- Okay, we tried to go there on a Saturday night."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Just you and me."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"- I'm not making any phone calls or anything."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"- None of the, yeah, no phone calls."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"- Just showing up."
01:47:12;01:47:13;"- But we're dressed appropriately."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"We're like wearing whatever, like a suit,"
01:47:15;01:47:16;"whatever you're supposed to wear."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- What time are you going?"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"- We're wearing going out shirts."
01:47:19;01:47:20;"- Yeah."
01:47:20;01:47:23;"I don't know, what's like 11.30 on a Saturday night?"
01:47:23;01:47:25;"- And we just get in line and wait."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"We're gonna wait there all night."
01:47:26;01:47:27;"That's my gut."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"- Yeah."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- Well, okay, okay."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"- We're not getting in."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"- What's the move we could make?"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"- The move we could make is, I would put out an APB."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"I don't know."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"I'm honestly not sure."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"First I'd hit up my manager saying,"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"me and Jake really wanna go to Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"- It's Jake's 41st birthday."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"He really wants to."
01:47:44;01:47:47;"- And he wants to go solo with me to Bootsy Bellows."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"I would hit up that, you know who I would hit up?"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"My trainer."
01:47:51;01:47:52;"- Oh, no way."
01:47:52;01:47:55;"- He's like a going out type guy."
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Fred."
01:47:56;01:47:57;"- Yeah, he's into it."
01:47:57;01:48:00;"- I would text Fred like, Fred, two questions."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Can you do 10.30 on Monday?"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"And also, can you get me in front of the Bootsy Bellows?"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- It's a bit of a stretch."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"(laughing)"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"- People really, they'll say anything to get in."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"I've witnessed crazy things."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"- So you've been once."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- To Bootsy?"
01:48:16;01:48:16;"- Yeah, Bootsy."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"- I know, I lied."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"I've been a few times."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"- I mean, you're calling it."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"You're calling it by just part of its name."
01:48:22;01:48:23;"- That's how you do it."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"- You're on a first name basis with Bootsy."
01:48:26;01:48:27;"- It's two Bs, it's a hard one."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"I have to stick with the one."
01:48:29;01:48:31;"No, people, yeah."
01:48:31;01:48:33;"I don't remember what I was saying."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"- People say the craziest things to get in."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"And then there's the times where they're getting,"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"girls are getting kicked out and they can't speak"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"and they're still trying to get back in."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"- Oh, 'cause they're hammered?"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Is that why they're getting kicked out?"
01:48:45;01:48:46;"- Please, everyone."
01:48:46;01:48:51;"- And when you go to these clubs,"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"they're super crowded, they're loud."
01:48:54;01:48:55;"- Yeah."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"- This is what's happening."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"So let's say we got in."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"- Yeah, let's just play this out."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"- They might have a more tasteful DJ."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"But let's say we actually got in."
01:49:03;01:49:06;"It's me, you, and my trainer."
01:49:06;01:49:07;"- Can I come?"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"- Yeah."
01:49:08;01:49:08;"- Me, you, my trainer, and Kazzy."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"- Thank you."
01:49:09;01:49:10;"- There's the four of us rolling in."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- She avoids dropping her father's name."
01:49:12;01:49:14;"- She avoids dropping her father's name."
01:49:14;01:49:15;"We get in."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"It was all about the trainer."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"He got us in."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"And then we're just in there."
01:49:20;01:49:23;"I'm like, you guys want a drink?"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"He's like, what, man?"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"And I'm like, you want a drink?"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- Yeah."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"- And then you don't see me for 30 minutes."
01:49:29;01:49:31;"And then it's just like the three of you sit,"
01:49:31;01:49:32;"like literally, this is what happens."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- Are we standing?"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Or are we trying to get a table?"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"- This is so accurate."
01:49:35;01:49:36;"- You're standing, kind of looking for a place."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"- Also, like, good people are touching you."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"- Yeah, you're getting pushed by all these people."
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Like, there's a lot of skin."
01:49:42;01:49:45;"People are just like, people are treating you like dirt."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"- Are you dancing?"
01:49:46;01:49:47;"- Well, no."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"- Because you're not even in a place where you can dance."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"'Cause we're in the entrance still,"
01:49:52;01:49:53;"'cause it's so crowded."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"- Right."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"- And we have to go to the bar."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"- We're on the perimeter of the thing."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"So I'm out getting a drink."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"- Okay."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- Like, maybe my trainer's on the,"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"he's actually having a good time in this room."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"So then it's just you and Kazzy now."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"And then you're kind of like,"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"you don't wanna be dancing that much."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"You're like, so, yeah."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"You're trying to have a conversation like,"
01:50:09;01:50:11;"this is funny, what?"
01:50:11;01:50:11;"It's like crazy."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"- It's like, you can't talk, you can't dance."
01:50:14;01:50:15;"'Cause it's like, embarrassing."
01:50:15;01:50:16;"What are you gonna do?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"- What are you dropping on those drinks?"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"You're getting drinks for you, me, Kazzy, and the trainer."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- It depends."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"- It'll probably be $40."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"- Yeah, what do you want?"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"- That's it?"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"- No, it's gonna be more than $40."
01:50:25;01:50:25;"- Really?"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"- What do you want?"
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- A vodka soda."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"- What do you want, Jake?"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"- Tequila on the rocks."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"- Okay."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"- Napatron, like well, well tequila."
01:50:33;01:50:34;"- Well tequila?"
01:50:34;01:50:34;"- Yeah."
01:50:34;01:50:35;"- All right."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"It's probably gonna be 13 each."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"- That's not terrible."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"- Maybe more, maybe like 15."
01:50:40;01:50:42;"- What's bottle service?"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"What is that?"
01:50:43;01:50:46;"- Bottle service is when you charge for a bottle"
01:50:46;01:50:51;"that would cost $40 at Costco, you charge 12 to 1500."
01:50:51;01:50:53;"And occasionally--"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"- Solid markup."
01:50:54;01:50:55;"- So the way that clubs make money"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"is not from the schlubs like us,"
01:50:57;01:51:00;"like pushing our way in to drop like 100 bucks."
01:51:00;01:51:04;"It's by they give a table to somebody who will bring out,"
01:51:04;01:51:07;"you know, they bring out the champagne with sparklers on it"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"and they might be like, order a fancy champagne."
01:51:10;01:51:13;"Maybe that, you know, they get the occasional person"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"in Bootsy Bellows who probably single-handedly drops $50,000."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"That probably happens every weekend."
01:51:17;01:51:18;"- Worth it."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"- A couple of times."
01:51:19;01:51:20;"It's worth it."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"So we're just in there like packed like sardines."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"I just like come, we're just like awkwardly drinking"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"these things, kind of dancing,"
01:51:26;01:51:28;"but we don't even have room to dance."
01:51:28;01:51:30;"And then best case scenario,"
01:51:30;01:51:35;"we see Leonardo DiCaprio sitting on the top of like a,"
01:51:35;01:51:38;"one of like the benches in a booth."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"That's it, kind of."
01:51:39;01:51:40;"- Best case."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- That's the best case scenario."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- No, he would never be there."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"It would be more like someone like,"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"I once saw Chase Crawford there."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"That's like the most famous person I've seen at a club."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"I like a Bootsy club."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"- I mean, Drake has been to Bootsy Bellows."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"I mean, that's like, yeah, maybe not everything."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"- Really?"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"- Yeah."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"- I guess I don't."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"- I don't think he was like so past the club scene."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"Maybe he just hasn't been single in a while."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"- I've seen Leo at art openings."
01:52:03;01:52:04;"- Oh yeah?"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"- Oh yeah."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"- That's more a scene."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"- So you already saw Leo."
01:52:07;01:52:07;"You already saw Leo."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"It's not going to be fun."
01:52:08;01:52:09;"- 50 grand?"
01:52:09;01:52:15;"More than like a public school teacher's salary for a year."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"- Yeah, man."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"- Unlike champagne."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"- I've been trying to tell you, man,"
01:52:19;01:52:22;"the millionaires and the billionaires"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"are out having fun at Bootsy Bellows"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"while the average American."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"- The terrorists hate us."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"- Yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"I mean, it's not a good look."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"- It's a terrible look."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"- And then like, so then we're in there for a while."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"- I just don't understand."
01:52:34;01:52:39;"Even if I had like $80 million in my checking account,"
01:52:39;01:52:42;"I still can't conceive of like dropping 50K."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"- But they don't even know how much"
01:52:43;01:52:46;"they're going to be spending until after the bill comes"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"because they'll keep bringing bottles"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"if girls at their table are like drinking."
01:52:50;01:52:54;"If they drink more, there's like 20 people at the table."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"All the drinks will be gone."
01:52:55;01:52:56;"So then they'll keep bringing."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"- They literally might have a friend cruising around"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"to get like all the hot girls to come sit at the table."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"- But then they end up paying more."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"- This must happen where some guy's not loaded."
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Some guy's fronting when he's loaded."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"- It happens all the time."
01:53:08;01:53:11;"- And then he's just like rolling with the momentum"
01:53:11;01:53:14;"and then the bill comes and it's like 34,000"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"and he's got like 60 bucks in his checking account."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"How does that play out?"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"- I don't know."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"Maybe they just like, they beat him up."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- What?"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Cool business plan."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- You try to split it with like everyone"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"who's at the table."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"Everyone would be so confused."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"No one's ever had to split anything before."
01:53:32;01:53:36;"- Debit cards, just like 16 different debit cards"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"at like 2.15 in the morning."
01:53:38;01:53:41;"Everyone's putting like 1200 bucks on a debit card."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"- Oh God."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Yeah, that's best case scenario."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"Then we're walking out of there at 2 a.m."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"Ears ringing."
01:53:48;01:53:51;"- You hungry?"
01:53:51;01:53:54;"- Yeah, then we're going to Mel's."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"- Just get a cheeseburger at Mel's."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"Yeah, I don't get it."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"- Crazy."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"- And it's not fun."
01:54:02;01:54:02;"- It's not fun."
01:54:02;01:54:06;"And I think even like, even people who love to dance,"
01:54:06;01:54:07;"that's not where they want to go."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"That's not where you're going to have a good time."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"We should start at a club night."
01:54:11;01:54:14;"I think it'd be a good way to make some off the books money."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"I bet there's a lot of people in LA."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"- That's a really good idea."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"- Oh, like a time crisis club night?"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"- We should do a time crisis club night"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"for people who don't like the chain smokers"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"and want to dance to the more tasteful palette"
01:54:23;01:54:24;"of seventies rock."
01:54:24;01:54:25;"- What's our venue?"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"Like an all ages club?"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"- I'll find some place."
01:54:27;01:54:31;"And then we're doing a $20 Modelo's."
01:54:31;01:54:34;"- Still not chill."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"- And the night will be called $20 Modelo."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"It'll be like a thing."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"It'd be kind of fun."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"We even like slap a sticker on it."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"So you can do an Instagram,"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"like a view of your $20 Modelo."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- I think we do free beer, dude."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"- Free beer?"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- I think we throw like a kegger."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- So you're going to have just guys in there."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"- This is it."
01:54:50;01:54:51;"Okay, you're right."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Okay."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"- Widen the attraction."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"- Okay."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"This is a good idea."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"I'm glad we had this brainstorming,"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"this brainstorm sesh."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"Time crisis club night."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"- I'm in."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"- We got to do one club night"
01:55:05;01:55:09;"to get Jake's guitar out of the pawn shop"
01:55:09;01:55:13;"so that he can rip a solo on the Vampire Weekend album."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"That's the plot."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- Love it."
01:55:15;01:55:18;"- Jake had to pawn his beloved Strat."
01:55:18;01:55:21;"We got to throw one sick club night to get it unpawned."
01:55:22;01:55:26;"Okay, Kazzy, thank you so much for coming through."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"- Thank you for having me."
01:55:27;01:55:27;"- To Time Crisis."
01:55:27;01:55:30;"Everybody got to check out 86'd."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"You just go to YouTube."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"You don't need to go to anywhere else, right?"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"- Yeah, you can just go on YouTube."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"- Google Kazzy."
01:55:35;01:55:36;"That's her full name."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"David, you'll find it."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Come back sometime."
01:55:39;01:55:39;"- I would love to."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"This was a blast."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"- We really appreciate having you here."
01:55:42;01:55:45;"As I reflect on the show today,"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"I don't feel as strongly about boycotting Wendy's,"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"but I don't know."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"Let's readdress on the next episode."
01:55:52;01:55:54;"- Let's talk to that guy, if possible."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"- Let's get that guy's side of the story."
