00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, the day after my birthday. New year, new me. Today, Jake and I will be talking"
00:09;00:21;"about the Eagles, KFC in Indonesia, and of course, Pepsi and their controversial new commercial."
00:21;00:29;"We'll be joined by Deezus to take in the world around us. This is Time Crisis."
00:29;00:31;"With Ezra King."
00:31;00:35;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"The war I felt, warmingly, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"He's the lonely man."
01:17;01:22;"Time Crisis, Sunday, April 9th, 2017. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:24;"Hey, I just crushed a burrito."
01:24;01:25;"Yeah, me too."
01:25;01:26;"Woo!"
01:26;01:28;"You know, yesterday was my birthday."
01:28;01:30;"It was? April 8th?"
01:30;01:33;"Isn't that the day that Cobain died?"
01:33;01:37;"Yeah, well, I've always associated my birthday with the death of Kurt Cobain."
01:37;01:42;"He was the lead singer of Nirvana, for the listeners, but he didn't die on the 8th."
01:42;01:46;"But here's why I remember it. He died on, I believe, the 6th or the 5th."
01:46;01:47;"Okay."
01:47;01:49;"They found his body on the 8th."
01:49;01:50;"News broke."
01:50;01:51;"Yeah."
01:51;01:53;"For some reason, that was a huge Nirvana head."
01:53;01:54;"Yeah."
01:54;01:56;"Junior year of high school."
01:56;02:01;"And I remember just kind of marking that date in my memory. It was April 8th."
02:01;02:07;"That must have been the day they found the body, because the reason I remember it so well is because that was April 8th, 1994."
02:07;02:08;"Yep."
02:08;02:09;"So it was my 10th birthday."
02:09;02:10;"Wow, I was 17."
02:10;02:12;"You were 17."
02:12;02:14;"Learning to drive, or driving."
02:14;02:17;"I drove home that day. I got the news."
02:17;02:19;"And you were just like in history class?"
02:19;02:25;"Well, no, no, no. I got in my car, and they were playing Nirvana on every rock station."
02:25;02:29;"I had this fleeting thought. I was like, maybe Kurt Cobain killed himself."
02:29;02:32;"Maybe Chris Novoselic died in a car crash."
02:32;02:36;"That was my second thought. And it turned out, boom."
02:36;02:37;"Damn."
02:37;02:40;"So we would not have hung out in '94. That would have been a weird hang."
02:40;02:45;"Yeah, yeah, you might have babysat me."
02:45;02:48;"But then, did you cry?"
02:48;02:52;"No, I didn't cry. I was shocked and bummed. I was a huge Nirvana head."
02:52;02:55;"That's crazy. I can't remember. I've never experienced that."
02:55;02:58;"Somebody I was a huge fan of dying in their prime."
02:58;03:00;"Right, suddenly, violently."
03:00;03:03;"Of course, there are people I've been a fan of who've died."
03:03;03:06;"But, you know, and sometimes way too soon."
03:06;03:08;"But not like third album."
03:08;03:10;"Right, right."
03:10;03:12;"I remember it really well, because on my 10th birthday."
03:12;03:17;"You know when you're 10, maybe these days it's earlier, because you get an iPad when you're born."
03:17;03:22;"But back then, when you're 10, I think I was just starting middle school."
03:22;03:25;"And that's when a few kids start rolling to school."
03:25;03:29;"Maybe kids with older siblings start rolling to school in a Nine Inch Nails t-shirt."
03:29;03:33;"You know, it's like, there's some kids who are still like babies, basically."
03:33;03:36;"And then there's other kids who are like proto-teens."
03:36;03:37;"Right."
03:37;03:42;"So I remember hanging out, and my main music friend was this guy named Willie Roger."
03:42;03:43;"Good name."
03:43;03:46;"Yeah, he became Will later. Will Roger."
03:46;03:48;"Also a good name."
03:48;03:49;"He was really into heavy music."
03:49;03:53;"So even at 10, he was like, you know, just picture us being like 10 and 4th."
03:53;03:58;"I think maybe it was 4th grade, just being like, ""Hey Ezra, you ever heard of Helmet?"""
03:58;03:59;"[laughter]"
03:59;04:01;"Just be like, ""Uh, I don't think so."""
04:01;04:04;"But anyway, you know, I would listen to some rock radio."
04:04;04:06;"And I remember I liked Heart Shaped Box."
04:06;04:07;"Sure."
04:07;04:09;"Which was on the radio a lot of the time."
04:09;04:14;"Because I also remember in 4th grade, we had vocabulary lists every week to learn words."
04:14;04:17;"And one time, one of the words was ""debt."""
04:17;04:20;"You know, which when you're 10, not everybody understands that word."
04:20;04:23;"That's like, you know, it seems really basic to us now."
04:23;04:25;"But that's like a kind of tough concept."
04:25;04:26;"Sure."
04:26;04:28;"I remember my teacher was like, ""Does anybody know the word 'debt'?"""
04:28;04:33;"And I was like, ""Yes, it's in the Nirvana song, Heart Shaped Box, 'Forever'."""
04:33;04:35;"She was like, ""What's the context?"""
04:35;04:37;"And I was like, ""Uh, 'Forever' and 'Debt' is your priceless advice."""
04:37;04:39;"[laughter]"
04:39;04:41;"But anyway, I had some vague sense of Nirvana."
04:41;04:42;"And I was aware of Nirvana."
04:42;04:44;"Friends would talk about Nirvana."
04:44;04:46;"But I wasn't in yet."
04:46;04:48;"I definitely didn't know the name Kurt Cobain."
04:48;04:50;"It was a weekend, as I recall."
04:50;04:52;"A bunch of kids came over to the house."
04:52;04:59;"And Will Roger, his gift to me was the Nirvana album in utero on cassette."
04:59;05:00;"Sick."
05:00;05:01;"So I was like, ""Cool."""
05:01;05:06;"So in some ways, that was like my first real album I ever received."
05:06;05:07;"Really?"
05:07;05:09;"I think I had some CDs and tapes."
05:09;05:11;"Maybe I didn't even have CDs yet."
05:11;05:12;"But he gave it to me on tape."
05:12;05:13;"So I was like, ""Oh, that's cool."""
05:13;05:14;"And I was looking at it."
05:14;05:18;"And the cover is a model of a woman with a baby."
05:18;05:20;"And I was like, ""Whoa, this is crazy."""
05:20;05:22;"So I was like, ""That's cool."""
05:22;05:25;"And then I remember on the Monday coming to school,"
05:25;05:28;"and another kid who'd been at my birthday party named Ryan Ayres--"
05:28;05:30;"and he also had older siblings--"
05:30;05:32;"and I remember Ryan Ayres coming over and being like,"
05:32;05:35;"""Yo, the dude from that band is dead."""
05:35;05:36;"I was like, ""Which band?"""
05:36;05:38;"He's like, ""Nirvana, your tape."""
05:38;05:40;"And I was like, ""What?"""
05:40;05:45;"So basically, almost immediately after getting my first Nirvana album,"
05:45;05:47;"I find out this guy had died."
05:47;05:49;"But I didn't really know who he was, you know,"
05:49;05:51;"other than that it was the dude from Nirvana."

31:06;31:10;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
31:10;31:15;"So that's one classic brand KFC. One of the largest brands globally too."
31:15;31:16;"Yeah, huge."
31:16;31:19;"What's this Fox News Eagles thing? Can you break it down for me man?"
31:19;31:26;"I'll try. You're aware of this like Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment suit and settlement that's been happening."
31:26;31:31;"Oh yeah, notorious scumbag Bill O'Reilly getting accused yet again."
31:31;31:38;"According to a lawsuit filed on Monday, there's this guy Bill Shine, co-president of Fox News."
31:38;31:45;"In some deposition, there was a woman that worked for the company that was putting forth a testimony."
31:45;31:52;"And he asked her during the meeting if she had seen the Showtime documentary on the band the Eagles called The History of the Eagles."
31:52;31:54;"So this is like at work?"
31:54;31:56;"This is in like a formal deposition."
31:56;31:59;"This conversation happened in the deposition?"
31:59;32:03;"The suit filed by Julie Roganiski, a liberal commentator for Fox News,"
32:03;32:08;"says Bill Shine offered this insight during a meeting on November 29th,"
32:08;32:14;"at which Roganiski reported that she was harassed and punished for refusing to have sex with Roger Ailes."
32:14;32:16;"Okay, now I understand the context."
32:16;32:19;"There's a woman who works at Fox News, a liberal commentator,"
32:19;32:26;"and she's going to meet with a higher up to tell him that she's being harassed"
32:26;32:30;"because she refused to have sex with another guy at the company."
32:30;32:35;"And rather than this guy say, ""Well, that's horrendous. Let's go to HR, report this, blah, blah, blah."""
32:35;32:40;"Instead, he says to her, ""Have you seen the Showtime documentary on the band the Eagles?"""
32:40;32:44;"Because the story of the Eagles was very similar to the story of Fox News,"
32:44;32:51;"i.e., in the same way that such brilliant musicians as Glenn Frey, Linda Ronstadt, and Jackson Browne,"
32:51;32:54;"neither of whom are members of the Eagles,"
32:54;33:01;"could only have come together at one place in one time in history, the Troubadour, circa 1970."
33:01;33:07;"So it was with Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Suzanne Scott, Roger Ailes, and Bill Shine"
33:07;33:09;"coming together to form Fox News."
33:09;33:16;"So he's trying to draw an analogy that says Fox News, like the Southern California country rock scene"
33:16;33:22;"that emerged out of the Troubadour circa 1970 and culminated in the triumph of the Eagles,"
33:22;33:31;"like that meeting of the minds, Fox News formed in 1996 under the guidance of Roger Ailes, is similar."
33:31;33:34;"Great minds, Hannity, O'Reilly."
33:34;33:36;"And that's all that's in the article?"
33:36;33:37;"Essentially. It was an op-ed."
33:37;33:42;"They just kind of wanted to point out that this dumbass tried to compare himself to the Eagles."
33:42;33:46;"It's not really a news item. It's more of like a, ""This was..."""
33:46;33:47;"It's like an ad."
33:47;33:49;"""This happened, and this is hilarious, and we should..."""
33:49;33:53;"Right. See, what I want to know is... What's the woman's name again, Jane?"
33:53;33:55;"Julie Roganiski."
33:55;33:56;"So Ms. Roganiski..."
33:56;33:58;"I might be murdering that pronunciation."
33:58;34:03;"This woman... I would love to know what happened on either end of the conversation."
34:03;34:09;"Because I'm just kind of wondering if she's like, ""Mr. Shine, I'm being punished for not having sex with Roger Ailes."""
34:09;34:11;"To which this guy replies..."
34:11;34:13;"See, I'm wondering how this went down."
34:13;34:14;"You know how he..."
34:14;34:16;"He looks out the window, and he's like..."
34:16;34:19;"""I get a peaceful..."""
34:19;34:22;"He's like, ""Julie, have you ever seen the Eagles documentary?"""
34:22;34:24;"""Easy feeling..."""
34:24;34:26;"Yes, of course I've seen the Eagles documentary."
34:26;34:32;"I fail to understand what that has to do with the fact that I'm telling you I was sexually harassed, you psycho."
34:32;34:33;"But have you heard the long run?"
34:33;34:34;"And then the guy's like..."
34:34;34:39;"""Hold on, hold on. I'm making a point. Sean Hannity is our Linda Ronstadt."""
34:39;34:42;"So I wonder if he does this whole analogy, and she's like..."
34:42;34:47;"""Okay, man. You guys are the Eagles. The Eagles. I hate the Eagles."""
34:47;34:49;"""I was sexually harassed, you piece of sh-"""
34:49;34:53;"""I like the way sparkling earrings shine."""
34:53;34:54;"This is my guess."
34:54;34:56;"He's basically trying to say to her..."
34:56;35:03;"""You know, back in the crazy 70s, the Eagles were notorious party animals."""
35:03;35:05;"""Fox News is like that."""
35:05;35:06;"""We're party animals?"""
35:06;35:07;"""We're party animals."""
35:07;35:09;"""That's the price that you pay for my greatness."""
35:09;35:11;"Yeah, that's basically what he's trying to say to her."
35:11;35:15;"""I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight."""
35:15;35:16;"God, what a nut."
35:16;35:17;"I feel terrible for this one."
35:17;35:19;"Imagine how nutty it is to work at Fox News, period."
35:19;35:20;"I know."
35:20;35:21;"Especially if you're the token liberal."
35:21;35:22;"Oh my God."
35:22;35:23;"And you're a woman."
35:23;35:24;"Oh my God."
35:24;35:25;"You're dealing with all these maniacs."
35:25;35:29;"And of all the bands this dude brings up, it's the Eagles."
35:29;35:36;"The most straight up douchebag, baby boomer power band."
35:36;35:37;"I know. It's like..."
35:37;35:39;"That band stands for..."
35:39;35:40;"Look, you and I both like the Eagles."
35:40;35:41;"Oh, I love the Eagles."
35:41;35:42;"You like the Eagles, but it's like..."
35:42;35:46;"Obviously to not address this woman's concerns already shows that this guy's a piece of sh*t."
35:46;35:54;"But it's even like digging himself deeper, the fact that his metaphor for why Fox News maybe is like the Wild West..."
35:54;35:55;"Are you finna Graham Parsons?"
35:55;35:56;"Yeah. Or not."
35:56;35:59;"He should've gone outside of music or been like the Founding Fathers."
35:59;36:02;"That would've been a more Fox News thing, is if he would've been like..."
36:02;36:03;"It's like the Founding Fathers."
36:03;36:04;"Were those men imperfect?"
36:04;36:05;"In many ways."
36:05;36:09;"Did they build a new nation and create freedom for millions of people?"
36:09;36:12;"Yes. That sounds like something a normal Fox News guy would say."
36:12;36:13;"And this dude is just like..."
36:13;36:16;"How dare you? We're the f*cking Eagles."
36:16;36:18;"So they had a second meeting on December 12th."
36:18;36:20;"He once again recommended it."
36:20;36:21;"Oh my god."
36:21;36:29;"Somehow expressing the belief that Ailes, a habitual sexual harasser, and his enablers were a gift to the nation like the Eagles."
36:29;36:31;"Okay, so that is what the metaphor meant."
36:31;36:34;"Yeah. Price you pay for greatness."
36:34;36:37;"You know, the Eagles, they always struck me as like a Republican band."
36:37;36:39;"We've talked about this before, but they actually weren't."
36:39;36:43;"No, Don Henley for sure's politics are not at all Republican."
36:43;36:45;"Mr. Henley, you gotta weigh in on this, man."
36:45;36:47;"Yeah, yeah. Henley needs to come out of the shadows."
36:47;36:49;"One of these nights"
36:49;36:54;"One of these crazy old nights"
36:54;36:59;"We're gonna find out, pretty mama"
36:59;37:03;"What turns on the lights"
37:03;37:09;"The full moon is calling, the fever is high"
37:09;37:13;"And the wicked wind whispers and moans"
37:14;37:18;"You got your demons, you got desires"
37:18;37:22;"But I got a few on my own"
37:22;37:27;"Ooh, someone to be come to"
37:27;37:30;"In between the dark and the light"
37:30;37:36;"Ooh, common life behind you"
37:36;37:38;"Swear I'm gonna find you"
37:38;37:40;"One of these nights"
37:40;37:42;"One of these dreams"
37:43;37:47;"One of these lost and lonely dreams"
37:47;37:51;"We're gonna find one"
37:51;37:56;"Ooh, one with realest screams"
37:56;38:02;"I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself"
38:02;38:05;"I've been searching for an angel in white"
38:05;38:10;"I've been waiting for a woman who's a little bold"
38:10;38:14;"And I can feel her but she's nowhere inside"
38:14;38:20;"Ooh, commonness behind you"
38:20;38:23;"In between the wrong and the right"
38:23;38:29;"Ooh, common life behind you"
38:29;38:31;"Swear I'm gonna find you"
38:31;38:33;"One of these nights"
38:33;38:35;"You ready to talk about Pepsi?"
38:35;38:36;"You know it."
38:36;38:39;"Pepsi's come up on Time Crisis quite a few times."
38:39;38:40;"Yeah."
38:40;38:43;"The reason we're talking about it this week, for anybody who hasn't been following the news,"
38:43;38:47;"is that Pepsi dropped a controversial advertisement starring Kendall Jenner."
38:47;38:48;"Did you watch it, Jake?"
38:48;38:49;"Yep."
38:49;38:53;"You know, lately there have been a lot of these kind of mini-movie prestige commercials."
38:53;38:55;"Like the Budweiser one."
38:55;38:57;"Like the Budweiser one, which I also thought was hilarious."
38:57;38:59;"This was a Budweiser Super Bowl ad,"
38:59;39:03;"and basically they turned the founding of Budweiser into an immigrant story,"
39:03;39:06;"where you saw the original..."
39:06;39:08;"Anheuser-Meet-Busch."
39:08;39:09;"Yeah."
39:09;39:10;"Adolphus Busch."
39:10;39:12;"You see him in Germany,"
39:12;39:15;"and he says to his family, ""I want to go to America to make beer."""
39:15;39:17;"And then he comes to America, he gets off the boat..."
39:17;39:18;"And it's like, ""There'll be blood."""
39:18;39:20;"It looks like there'll be blood meets like gangs in New York."
39:20;39:23;"And yeah, he gets to America, and the first thing they say to him is,"
39:23;39:24;"""Go home!"""
39:24;39:25;"""You're not welcome here."""
39:26;39:29;"And then he shares a moment,"
39:29;39:31;"almost looks like on the Mississippi River,"
39:31;39:33;"with a black man."
39:33;39:35;"It's basically showing, like a..."
39:35;39:38;"Turning the story of Anheuser-Busch,"
39:38;39:39;"which is now a gigantic corporation,"
39:39;39:42;"which I believe is owned by a Brazilian company now."
39:42;39:43;"Belgian."
39:43;39:44;"Belgian?"
39:44;39:45;"I believe it's called InBev."
39:45;39:46;"You know what, Jake?"
39:46;39:48;"This is one of those rare times when we're both right."
39:48;39:49;"School me."
39:49;39:51;"InBev was a brewing company that resulted from the merger"
39:51;39:54;"between Belgian-based company Interbrew"
39:54;39:56;"and Brazilian brewer AmBev."
39:56;39:57;"Okay."
39:57;39:59;"That took place in 2004, and then..."
39:59;40:01;"Something happened, who cares."
40:01;40:02;"I think they're headquartered in Brussels."
40:02;40:03;"Anyway."
40:03;40:06;"This was one of those Super Bowl ads that was kind of like..."
40:06;40:08;"Turned the story of Anheuser-Busch"
40:08;40:10;"into this immigrant story."
40:10;40:13;"Like, the guy came to America because he wanted to make beer."
40:13;40:15;"Roll your sleeves up, get to work."
40:15;40:17;"I don't know why he couldn't make beer in Germany."
40:17;40:21;"Maybe at the time, you didn't have freedom to brew in Germany."
40:21;40:22;"Maybe it was harder to be an entrepreneur,"
40:22;40:24;"for whatever reason."
40:24;40:25;"Yeah."
40:25;40:27;"Rising socialism, man."
40:27;40:30;"Or the social stratification was really harsh, I don't know."
40:30;40:33;"So anyway, that commercial was like this mini-movie"
40:33;40:39;"that turned the story of a beer produced by a gigantic international company"
40:39;40:41;"into a story that you're drinking history,"
40:41;40:44;"you're drinking the American dream,"
40:44;40:46;"you're drinking immigration."
40:46;40:49;"When you drink that brew, you're honoring"
40:49;40:51;"not only the story of Adolphus Busch,"
40:51;40:53;"you're honoring your own family's immigration story"
40:53;40:55;"because all Americans are immigrants,"
40:55;40:57;"except for Native Americans,"
40:57;41:00;"who obviously don't get to tell their side of the story"
41:00;41:02;"in the Budweiser commercial."
41:02;41:04;"So anyway, there have been a lot of commercials like that."
41:04;41:08;"And then, you know, Pepsi, famously a youth brand,"
41:08;41:10;"decides they want to do a kind of youthful take on this."
41:10;41:13;"So they make this commercial that's Kendall Jenner,"
41:13;41:16;"famous model, part of the Kardashian-Jenner family."
41:16;41:17;"It's like a mini-movie, it's like two minutes,"
41:17;41:19;"and there's a lot of different characters,"
41:19;41:21;"and it's a very diverse cast."
41:21;41:24;"Basically, there's some kind of big protest going on outside."
41:24;41:27;"She is doing a photo shoot, wearing a blonde wig."
41:27;41:29;"This is one of my favorite details, too."
41:29;41:32;"In the commercial, she's busy doing her job, you know?"
41:32;41:34;"She's a model. She's wearing a blonde wig."
41:34;41:39;"But then she sees the passion of all these different people"
41:39;41:41;"marching for this generic..."
41:41;41:44;"Yeah, it's unclear what the cause of the protest is."
41:44;41:47;"One of the signs that somebody's holding says,"
41:47;41:49;"""Join the conversation."""
41:54;41:57;"Historically, when the police state refuses to join the conversation,"
41:57;42:00;"that's when people get out in the streets and say,"
42:00;42:02;"""Join the conversation, man."""
42:02;42:05;"So anyway, I love this. She's taking pictures,"
42:05;42:08;"and she sees this generic protest go by."
42:08;42:11;"And she says, ""You know what? I can't stay here,"
42:11;42:15;"""being some corporate stooge, taking pictures for Cosmo."""
42:15;42:17;"""Sell international brands."""
42:17;42:19;"""I'm not trying to sell international brands."""
42:19;42:20;"""In Jakarta."""
42:20;42:23;"""I don't want to be the face of selling a product."""
42:23;42:26;"""I want to get in the streets and join this generic protest."""
42:26;42:29;"She grabs a Pepsi, as one does, gets in the protest."
42:29;42:31;"You die in a thirst."
42:31;42:34;"She follows the protest and sees they come up against a police barricade."
42:34;42:38;"And she's the only one who's brave enough, of the assembled mass,"
42:38;42:40;"to approach the police officer."
42:40;42:42;"And she gives him a Pepsi."
42:42;42:44;"He drinks it, cracks a smile to his buddy,"
42:44;42:47;"and then inexplicably everybody starts chanting,"
42:47;42:49;"awkwardly throwing their hands in the air."
42:49;42:52;"There's also this whole subplot about a woman in a hijab"
42:52;42:54;"who's a frustrated photographer."
42:54;42:56;"She's like a journalist or something?"
42:56;42:59;"Yeah. Anyway, we can talk more about this specific thing later."
42:59;43:02;"We're going to get on the phone with Deezus, Deezus Nice,"
43:02;43:04;"aka Young Chipotle."
43:04;43:05;"Young Chipotle?"
43:05;43:07;"We should also ask him about that."
43:07;43:08;"That's a tight name."
43:08;43:10;"But just so people understand."
43:10;43:11;"That's what we're talking about."
43:11;43:13;"Oh, and what's the soundtrack?"
43:13;43:15;"It's a song from Skip Marley."
43:15;43:17;"And he's the grandson of Bob?"
43:17;43:19;"Yes. Skip has been out there a lot recently."
43:19;43:21;"That seems sane."
43:21;43:22;"That's a tough one."
43:22;43:24;"And I don't know Skip Marley personally,"
43:24;43:26;"and I don't know much of his music."
43:26;43:29;"I will just say that, at least with his big looks,"
43:29;43:33;"back to back, he kind of dropped a somewhat innocuous verse"
43:33;43:35;"in the Katy Perry song about--"
43:35;43:38;"I don't want to say innocuous, but let's say kind of general language"
43:38;43:42;"about fighting the power and sticking together."
43:42;43:44;"That's what his grandfather did."
43:44;43:46;"One love."
43:46;43:48;"No, but Bob got deep, man."
43:48;43:50;"I love Bob. I'm all in on Bob."
43:50;43:53;"And we're not anti-Skip Marley, but it's like--"
43:53;43:55;"When you look at a lot of Bob's lyrics,"
43:55;44:00;"the ones that are not Rasta-specific are very general."
44:00;44:03;"And that can be great. John Lennon wrote really general lyrics."
44:03;44:05;"Yeah, no, but he had specific."
44:05;44:06;"Bob didn't do Pepsi ads."
44:06;44:10;"Bob did not do Pepsi ads, although now there is a Bob Marley-branded"
44:10;44:14;"series of beverages, teas, iced coffees."
44:14;44:16;"Whatever. This is not about Skip Marley,"
44:16;44:19;"but of course you can imagine that the people who put together the Pepsi ad"
44:19;44:22;"were like, ""Oh, we'll also get the grandson of Bob Marley."""
44:22;44:24;"It's like--"
44:24;44:27;"It is a little bit about Skip Marley in the sense that, yeah,"
44:27;44:30;"they're using his legacy of this--"
44:30;44:35;"One of the most iconic politically engaged artists of the 20th century"
44:35;44:40;"taking his grandson to leech on his credibility."
44:40;44:42;"Dude, that's a really uncharitable interpretation."
44:42;44:45;"Wait, of Pepsi? That's exactly what Pepsi is doing."
44:45;44:49;"And Skip, you know, he's 19. He didn't know what he was doing."
44:49;44:50;"Psh."
44:50;44:51;"He's making money."
44:51;44:53;"Well, that's something that's come up because Kendall Jenner"
44:53;44:55;"has bared the brunt of the criticism."
44:55;44:56;"Yeah."
44:56;44:58;"I mean, I know we're all postmodern and everything,"
44:58;45:00;"and it's impossible to sell out anymore."
45:00;45:01;"No."
45:01;45:04;"I'm like an old punk rocker over here, but I got to say,"
45:04;45:06;"if that's not an example of selling out, I don't know what is."
45:06;45:09;"Well, good news for you, old punk rocker. People were mad."
45:09;45:13;"I know. I was shocked how big this was on the Internet."
45:13;45:16;"Well, I think it's because this is the era of Black Lives Matter,"
45:16;45:19;"so it's like there's a lot of things people are protesting about,"
45:19;45:22;"but one of the main things that you've been seeing organized protests for"
45:22;45:25;"the past few years in America, at least, has been about Black Lives Matter,"
45:25;45:29;"so you can't use that to sell sugar water."
45:29;45:30;"No."
45:55;46:04;"Oh, why can't we roam the open country?"
46:04;46:08;"Open country."
46:08;46:13;"Oh, why can't we be what we want to be?"
46:13;46:17;"We want to be free."
46:17;46:21;"Want to be free."
46:21;46:27;"Three o'clock in the rain."
46:27;46:34;"And I'm a-blockin', like I have said."
46:34;46:41;"And I've got to throw away."
46:41;46:47;"Yes, I've got to throw away."
46:53;47:00;"My little world star."
47:00;47:13;"Oh, I'm telling you, it's a red-blue music."
47:13;47:26;"Oh, I'm begin to say, red-blue music."
47:26;47:32;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
47:32;47:34;"Let's just talk about the history of Pepsi, man,"
47:34;47:36;"because maybe we don't know enough about Pepsi."
47:36;47:38;"Maybe we're being too hard on Pepsi."
47:38;47:39;"Walk me through."
47:39;47:40;"All right, man."
47:40;47:43;"I mean, I know some of the big bullet points, as discussed earlier."
47:43;47:45;"The first bullet point is incredible."
47:45;47:51;"Pepsi was originally created in the 1890s by Caleb ""Doc"" Bradham in North Carolina."
47:51;47:53;"It's a southern beverage."
47:53;47:56;"And back then, it was known as Brad's drink."
47:56;48:01;"I want the Budweiser ad, or like Pepsi's version of their Budweiser ad."
48:01;48:02;"Yeah."
48:02;48:03;"The founding of Pepsi in North Carolina."
48:03;48:05;"There's so many commercials like that now."
48:05;48:06;"In 1890."
48:06;48:09;"Where they take these like fully like international corporate brands,"
48:09;48:13;"and they try to go back into the history to find that kind of like American entrepreneur vibe,"
48:13;48:20;"where it's kind of like the Dodge Brothers founded Dodge Motors, blah, blah, blah."
48:20;48:25;"Jameson Whiskey, when Mr. Jameson first started brewing his way,"
48:25;48:28;"when Jack Daniel--it's always the same thing."
48:28;48:30;"Like we've been doing this forever, and it's like--"
48:30;48:34;"When World War II veteran Glenn Bell moved back to Southern California"
48:34;48:38;"and opened his own taco stand in Downey, California in 1962,"
48:38;48:39;"the world had no idea."
48:39;48:40;"All this stuff is so brutal."
48:40;48:42;"The Chalupa was soon born."
48:42;48:45;"Almost none of these things are still owned by the original--"
48:45;48:48;"This is all part of like international global capitalism,"
48:48;48:51;"so to like go back to that is so funny."
48:51;48:56;"So it's just like the commercial opens, ""1895, North Carolina."
48:56;49:00;"Caleb 'Doc' Bradham had it up to here with that Coke bullshit."
49:00;49:02;"He started brewing Brad's drink."
49:02;49:05;"Today it's called Pevis."""
49:05;49:08;"""His son had been kicked in the head by a horse."
49:08;49:11;"To nurse his son back to health, he concocted his own medicine."""
49:11;49:12;"Oh, God."
49:12;49:15;"""Pepsi. Pepsi tonic."""
49:15;49:19;"Making these stories up to sell you sugar water."
49:19;49:21;"That's so bad for you."
49:21;49:24;"It's so pathetic, man. It's so brutal."
49:24;49:27;"The ad was funny too because no one in that ad is drinking Pepsi."
49:27;49:30;"Everyone's like--their BMI is like insanely low."
49:30;49:33;"Everyone's like hella fit, working out eight hours a day."
49:33;49:36;"None of the actors would touch a Pepsi, would come anywhere near it."
49:36;49:37;"Of course not."
49:37;49:38;"I love it."
49:38;49:39;"It's play acting."
49:39;49:41;"So then whatever. Pepsi exists for 60 years."
49:41;49:43;"It was the cheap drink."
49:43;49:46;"It was like, all right, they cut dad's overtime."
49:46;49:49;"No more Coke for a Pepsi household now."
49:49;49:51;"It was an embarrassment to drink Pepsi."
49:51;49:55;"But then Pepsi was tired of being a kitchen cola."
49:55;49:57;"It didn't want to be a bargain brand no more."
49:57;50:01;"It wanted to identify itself as a young, fashionable drink."
50:01;50:03;"And so in 1958, that's when it turned."
50:03;50:09;"That's when Pepsi went from this weird Brad's Drink cheap Coke"
50:09;50:11;"to being something for the kids."
50:11;50:16;"The initial catchphrase was, ""Be sociable. Have a Pepsi."""
50:16;50:19;"Pepsi's a drink that you drink when you're hanging out with your young friends."
50:19;50:20;"Be sociable."
50:20;50:23;"So anyway, we've talked before on this show that Pepsi--"
50:23;50:24;"Enter Donald Kendall."
50:24;50:29;"Donald Kendall, a Mad Men type dude who got behind it to really make Pepsi a global brand,"
50:29;50:31;"make sure they were first in the Soviet Union."
50:31;50:34;"This guy's all over the world trying to compete with Coke."
50:34;50:39;"Richard Nixon's working for them in the '60s after losing to JFK in '60"
50:39;50:41;"and before running in '68."
50:41;50:43;"He spent in the mid-'60s being their corporate lawyer."
50:43;50:44;"Right."
50:44;50:45;"Nothing says youth like--"
50:45;50:47;"Like Richard Nixon."
50:47;50:48;"--your corporate lawyer."
50:48;50:50;"Oh, God, it's so crazy."
50:50;50:54;"That'd basically be like maybe after Trump gets impeached,"
50:54;50:57;"Pepsi hires him just to do a few commercials."
50:57;50:58;"Probably somebody will."
50:58;50:59;"I could see it."
50:59;51:00;"He'll be making jokes about--"
51:00;51:01;"Like Rockstar?"
51:01;51:04;"Yeah, he'll be making jokes about being impeached."
51:04;51:07;"He'll be like, ""Wasn't that a crazy 18 months?"""
51:07;51:12;"But not as crazy as the amount of caffeine and taurine in the new Rockstar energy drink."
51:12;51:16;"So anyway, then Pepsi made up some dumb bullshit about being the Pepsi generation"
51:16;51:18;"because Coke was like the good one."
51:18;51:19;"Wait, so when was that? In the '60s?"
51:19;51:20;"That was in the '60s."
51:20;51:23;"Then in 1973, the Pepsi generation continued to evolve."
51:23;51:27;"They became--joined the Pepsi people, feeling free."
51:27;51:31;"So Pepsi's always been about freedom, pretending that it's about--"
51:31;51:33;"They tried to get Joni Mitchell to write a song for them."
51:33;51:35;"Be the free people."
51:37;51:38;"She turned them down."
51:38;51:41;"Then in the '80s, they really start pulling out all the stops,"
51:41;51:43;"and that's when they just start getting pop stars."
51:43;51:48;"They got Lionel Richie, Tina Turner, Gloria Estefan, Madonna, Michael Jackson."
51:48;51:51;"So like every 18 months, they were introducing a new--"
51:51;51:55;"They were just shelling out money, man, and especially Michael Jackson."
51:55;51:59;"Also, do you remember in the early '90s, they had those commercials with Ray Charles and Cindy Crawford?"
51:59;52:01;"Oh, yeah, kind of."
52:01;52:05;"So basically, as we were just talking about before, Pepsi--"
52:05;52:07;"Look, and we know Coke--Coke are bad, too."
52:07;52:09;"Coke's got a lot of blood on there."
52:09;52:10;"I was actually thinking about this."
52:10;52:15;"In some ways, Pepsi is like Hillary, like a moderate liberal that everybody's really hard on"
52:15;52:17;"because it's like trying to be hip."
52:17;52:19;"It's like Pokemon Go to the polls."
52:19;52:23;"Pepsi's like, ""We're cool, man. We're the youthful cola."
52:23;52:28;"We know about protesting and Kendall Jenner and Bob Marley's grandson. Why not?"""
52:28;52:33;"And you hate on them more because the hypocrisy is like, ""God, you're supposed to be the lefty."
52:33;52:35;"You're supposed to be the good one."""
52:35;52:37;"Coke's more like a George W. Bush cola."
52:37;52:39;"Grandfathered in."
52:39;52:44;"Yeah, where they're just kind of like, ""Oh, us? We're just old-school American, man."""
52:44;52:47;"Key difference, though--Coke is a superior beverage."
52:47;52:49;"It is a superior beverage."
52:49;52:52;"What I'm saying--Coke is kind of like a moderate Republican."
52:52;52:54;"And Pepsi is like a moderate liberal."
52:54;52:58;"So with Pepsi, because they're the youth brand, they got to take more chances than Coke."
52:58;53:03;"Coke can just push out the same polar bears every Christmas--Santa Claus."
53:03;53:05;"And it's because it's a superior beverage, honestly."
53:05;53:13;"We don't look to Coke to be all edgy, whereas Pepsi clearly is probably super insecure"
53:13;53:17;"because they know deep, deep down, we know you're just Brad's drink."
53:17;53:21;"It's 1892 North Carolina. You're just Brad's drink, man."
53:21;53:22;"Always going to be number two."
53:22;53:25;"Always going to be number two, but they have to buy friends, basically."
53:25;53:27;"They have to buy Michael Jackson as their friend."
53:27;53:28;"They have to buy Madonna."
53:28;53:30;"And now they bought Kendall Jenner."
53:30;53:32;"And, you know, she knew what she was getting into."
53:32;53:33;"And Skip Marley."
53:33;53:36;"And Skip Marley. I don't want to give everybody a pass."
56:34;56:38;"Now we're going to talk to Deezus to weigh in,"
56:38;56:40;"because I know Deezus is going to have some opinions on this."
56:40;56:43;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
56:43;56:46;"[phone ringing]"
56:46;56:47;"What's up, Deezus?"
56:47;56:50;"What's good? Bonjour from the Bronx."
56:50;56:52;"How are you doing, man?"
56:52;56:55;"Me and Jake are over here in LA doing Time Crisis."
56:55;56:57;"What time is it over there?"
56:57;56:59;"You know, it's mid-afternoon, man."
56:59;57:01;"Dang, man."
57:01;57:03;"We haven't had you on Time Crisis in person for a while."
57:03;57:04;"I miss you guys."
57:04;57:05;"I know. We miss you, man."
57:05;57:08;"And also, mostly because, I should point out,"
57:08;57:11;"because this was not true the last time we had you on the phone,"
57:11;57:14;"you've been pretty busy with the hit show,"
57:14;57:16;"Deezus and Mero on Viceland."
57:16;57:18;"Deezus and Mero on Viceland, yes."
57:18;57:19;"A very popular show."
57:19;57:24;"Shout out to Ezra, who was one of the exemplary early guests."
57:24;57:27;"He got in early before it became popular."
57:27;57:29;"I was on the first week. That's true."
57:29;57:31;"That's true friends. That's not booking agents."
57:31;57:32;"You know what I'm saying?"
57:32;57:33;"That's right. That's right."
57:33;57:35;"People, you've got to watch Deezus and Mero."
57:35;57:37;"It's 11 p.m. on Viceland, right?"
57:37;57:38;"Yeah, yeah."
57:38;57:40;"And check it out on-- you can also see it on YouTube"
57:40;57:42;"and probably on Twitter and stuff like that."
57:42;57:43;"Just look over it."
57:43;57:44;"Best show on late night."
57:44;57:45;"Thanks, man."
57:45;57:48;"So I know you guys have already covered this on the show."
57:48;57:50;"So that's why I wanted you to weigh in."
57:50;57:54;"But we're over here talking about the whole history of the Pepsi Corporation"
57:54;58:00;"because they dropped one of the worst/greatest commercials of all time this past week."
58:00;58:01;"Exactly."
58:01;58:03;"So first of all, we've got to get the Deezus take on it."
58:03;58:04;"Now, here's the Deezus take."
58:04;58:06;"Everyone I put in was like, ""Oh my God, look at Pepsi."
58:06;58:08;"We've got a boycott. This is horrible. This is tone deaf."""
58:08;58:13;"Deezus is a cynic, and I'm like, ""Yo, I feel like this worked perfectly."""
58:13;58:17;"If you were going to put out an ad and you just wanted to burn it real quick"
58:17;58:19;"and you wanted to put out-- it was like--"
58:19;58:21;"they're trying to say this ad will only run in Thailand or something like that."
58:21;58:24;"But this ad was perfect. It got it trending."
58:24;58:26;"Everyone was so mad, but guess what?"
58:26;58:29;"For the last 48 hours, all we've been thinking about is Pepsi."
58:29;58:35;"So it was a terrible ad, but it was so bad that you have to imagine that it was done on purpose."
58:35;58:39;"And also shout out to the Chemical Brothers who made a video with Rosario Dawson."
58:39;58:42;"The Kendall video for Pepsi is exactly like that video."
58:42;58:44;"I forgot the name of it, but Google that."
58:44;58:46;"Like they even stole the concept."
58:46;58:49;"That's why I don't think it was done on purpose."
58:49;58:51;"Because, I mean, let's be for real."
58:51;58:54;"You're tone deaf, but that's a whole other level of tone deaf."
58:54;58:57;"That's 1950s Mad Men tone deaf."
58:57;59:03;"Like there'd be four guys drinking strong vodka martinis at 12 a.m."
59:03;59:05;"while making decisions tone deaf."
59:05;59:07;"And you know, Pepsi's not stupid."
59:07;59:11;"Pepsi, when you work with them, they have a lot of layers and email tags and stuff."
59:11;59:13;"And it's got the traction it wanted."
59:13;59:16;"So you think it's possible that Pepsi was like,"
59:16;59:18;"""This is a job ad that's going to piss everybody off."
59:18;59:20;"At least they'll be talking about us."""
59:20;59:22;"Yes. Because think about it."
59:22;59:24;"At the end of the day, it comes down to what? Pepsi or Coke?"
59:24;59:25;"That's it."
59:25;59:27;"Even if you say Coke, they're going to be like, ""All we have is Pepsi."""
59:27;59:30;"If you say, ""I want a Pepsi,"" they say, ""All we have is Coke."""
59:30;59:31;"Pepsi's not going to lose."
59:31;59:35;"If Pepsi's going to advertise for the rest of the year, I feel like they'll be fine."
59:35;59:36;"We're going to still drink Pepsi."
59:36;59:37;"Do you drink Pepsi?"
59:37;59:38;"I actually prefer Coke."
59:38;59:41;"I feel Pepsi's a little harsh on the back of my throat."
59:41;59:44;"Have you ever met anybody who prefers Pepsi?"
59:44;59:48;"I had a co-worker that preferred Pepsi, but her father worked for Pepsi,"
59:48;59:50;"so she grew up drinking only Pepsi."
59:50;59:53;"And she swore to me that Coke burned her tongue."
59:53;59:57;"So at the end of the day, it's high fructose corn syrup."
59:57;59:59;"So let's not kid ourselves."
59:59;01:00:00;"We probably should not be drinking it."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"We really need to be drinking more water, stuff to make a living."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"That's true."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Like Aquafina."
01:00:05;01:00:08;"That's owned by Coca-Cola."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"No, Pepsi."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"Oh, Pepsi. Oh, Coke owns Dasani."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yep."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Alright, Deez, is Aquafina or Dasani?"
01:00:13;01:00:14;"Neither, actually."
01:00:14;01:00:15;"I hate to say it to both of those."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"Can you believe that?"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"The best place to go to water is New York City tap water."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"I love that."
01:00:19;01:00:24;"When you're in the bodega and it's a hot day, you need to grab a nice cold water."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"What's your go-to brand?"
01:00:25;01:00:29;"I get CG because the CG bottle is like a rectangle."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"And so if people see you drinking it on the subway, they're like,"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"""Yo, he got a little extra money."""
01:00:33;01:00:35;"And he also doesn't care about the environment."
01:00:35;01:00:38;"So, you know, I just want them to know that's my brand right there."
01:00:38;01:00:41;"You got money and you don't give a f--"
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Yeah."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"I'm dating Mother Nature, but I'm not making a real relationship card."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Wait, so Deez is--"
01:00:49;01:00:50;"That's terrible. I'm sorry."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"No, no, no."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"We appreciate that."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"Earth Day is coming up."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Yeah."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"I think everybody needs to take a good hard look at their relationship with Mother Nature,"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"given that it's April, Earth Day is about to come."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"To be fair, I have a compost heap, so--"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"You got a compost heap?"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"I do. I have a backyard in the Bronx."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"And my family's always done compost."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"We use the lawn clippings and we use some of the food,"
01:01:12;01:01:16;"but you can't just put regular food out there because we have a raccoon problem in the Bronx,"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"so you can't just put anything back there."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"But the compost is pretty good, and one of my parents, it's their house,"
01:01:20;01:01:25;"so when they come and visit, they spread the compost on the lawn for the garden,"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"and they grow vegetables."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"Oh, wow."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"It's like the whole hippie generation thing going on out there."
01:01:29;01:01:32;"If you want some tomatoes, Ezra, I'll bring them to you."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"You're growing tomatoes in the backyard?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Indeed."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Wow."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"One more question, Deezus."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"We talk a lot about just corporate food."
01:01:39;01:01:43;"We love fast food chains, corporate soda, all those types of things."
01:01:43;01:01:49;"So Jake was not aware that one of your famous nicknames is Young Chipotle."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Si, si, si. Si, si, puede, yes."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Because I also should point out for people who don't know,"
01:01:53;01:01:58;"not only are you and Mero on TV, but you still continue to do the greatest podcast of all time,"
01:01:58;01:01:59;"Bodega Boys."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"[singing]"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"Bodega Boys."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"You guys always introduce yourself with all your famous nicknames."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"The one you use is Young Chipotle."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"So what's your relationship to the Chipotle brand?"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"I'm actually sourdough to Chipotle brand."
01:02:10;01:02:14;"I feel at this time I've called myself Young Chipotle long enough and I'm popular enough"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"that I should have got one of those wooden cards from Chipotle"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"where I get a free burrito bowl every day."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"But I think every time they give them to celebrities,"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"they realize celebrities won't use them every day,"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"whereas myself, I will definitely get a burrito bowl every day"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"until I'm like 300 pounds or I just die."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"So I understand Chipotle."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"It's no hard feelings."
01:02:33;01:02:38;"Oh, right, yeah, because Chipotle, they'll send one to every member of the Kardashian family."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"That's a thing?"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Yes."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"That's a thing."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"You get a wooden--it's a free bowl of Chipotle every day."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"Do you think like Brad Pitt gets a Chipotle card?"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"I don't think he got one."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Did Beyonce get--I don't know if Beyonce got one,"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"but a couple of celebrities got one."
01:02:52;01:02:56;"A couple of celebrities, some Buzzfeed and other things have gotten some,"
01:02:56;01:03:00;"and I'm just like, ""My name is your name. Give me a card."""
01:03:00;01:03:02;"Wow, I'm looking at a picture of it now."
01:03:02;01:03:08;"These are custom-made, handcrafted, sustainably grown burrito cards."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"They're made out of wood."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"You see that?"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"Sustainably grown."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"Wow."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"All right, I want one of those cards."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"I'd rather see you get one before I got one."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Oh, no, I want both of you to get one."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"If Chipotle's not going to hook up Young Chipotle--"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"You know, how can I become old Chipotle if you're not going to hook up Young Chipotle?"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"Exactly."
01:03:30;01:03:33;"All right, well, thanks for calling, Desus. We'll see you soon."
01:03:33;01:03:36;"Yo, take care, man. We love you. Take it easy."
01:03:36;01:03:37;"Likewise. Have a good one."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Yeah."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"Is it possible? Could Desus be right?"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"No."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"You don't think Pepsi did it on purpose?"
01:06:44;01:06:45;"Absolutely not."
01:06:45;01:06:46;"Well, okay, then I would--"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"I would never roll a dice like that, knowingly."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"As someone pointed out,"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"this came out on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's death."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Could be a coincidence,"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"or it could be that somebody was like,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"""You know what? We're not going to make a big deal out of it,"
01:06:58;01:07:01;"but if we drop this on that day,"""
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I wonder if they literally were dreaming about this."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"They were like,"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"""People will be so excited"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"that we're engaging with the political moment,"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"and somebody--"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"we're doing this very subtly--"
01:07:11;01:07:15;"somebody's going to point out in a tweet or a Facebook post"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"what a nice resonance"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"that on the anniversary"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"of one of our greatest civil rights leaders"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"being assassinated,"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"Pepsi has dropped a commercial"
01:07:25;01:07:28;"that reminds us of our civic responsibility to protest."""
01:07:28;01:07:30;"I can imagine they were kind of hoping that would happen."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"That's amazing."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"I like to think about the meetings that were happening, like,"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"this past week."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"I wonder if someone's going to get fired."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"Clowning on it so hard."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"Okay, but Desus could be right"
01:07:38;01:07:41;"that it could increase sales in a weird way."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"It's pretty funny that a beverage company is so thirsty."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"Dad joke."
01:07:45;01:07:49;"But it's possible that Pepsi just needs to remind people"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"they exist over and over again."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"They buy friends."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"They have to pay Beyonce stupid money."
01:07:54;01:07:57;"They have to drop these dumb, wannabe hip ads."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"One thing I want to say about this,"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"I've seen some people be like,"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"""Well, you know, don't get mad at Kendall."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"Don't get mad at Skip Marley."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Get mad at these shadowy people behind the scenes."""
01:08:06;01:08:07;"Yeah."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"That's complete nonsense."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"People have to take responsibility,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"and I also just want to say,"
01:08:12;01:08:13;"I don't know for sure,"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"but as I've pointed out a few times on the show,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"I am a media professional."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"I have worked in show business for over nine years."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"I've been in those rooms."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"I've met the corporate head honchos,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"my music's been in commercials,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"and I'm not trying to say that Kendall Jenner's a bad person."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"I just want to make something clear about how the world works."
01:08:31;01:08:35;"Don't give a young model or singer,"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"in Skip Marley's case,"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"like this huge pass."
01:08:37;01:08:41;"When somebody asks you to be in something,"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"to do an endorsement deal,"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"or even to use your song,"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"anybody with half a brain,"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"certainly anybody with a whole team,"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"knows that you can ask for the creative."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"That's what they call it."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"What's the creative?"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"And if they don't want to give it to you,"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"then that's a decision you make."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Wait, I'm sorry."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"What does that mean?"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"So, for instance,"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"once a really big corporate bank"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"that's been involved in a lot of shady finance stuff"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"asked you to use a Vampire Weekend song in a big commercial."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Wow."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"In that case, we didn't need to ask what the creative was,"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"because you're just like,"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"""No, that's too brutal."""
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Obviously, I don't have hard and fast rules about corporate stuff,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"but I was like, ""No, can't do that."""
01:09:13;01:09:15;"Other times, you get offered something,"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"they might throw a number at you"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"and say what song they want to use,"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"and then you can say to yourself,"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"""Well, do I want to be responsible about this?"""
01:09:21;01:09:22;"And in that instance,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"you would say to your manager or whoever,"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"""Well, what's the commercial about?"""
01:09:26;01:09:27;"So it's like the context."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"And that's a very standard ask."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"It's not like they carry this around in a briefcase"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"and day of,"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Kendall Jenner gets there,"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"and they're like purposely hiding it from her."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"She probably got a brief,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"you know, the same way that if you were an actor or something,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"and somebody was like,"
01:09:42;01:09:46;"""Hey, this is a movie about a protest,"""
01:09:46;01:09:48;"you might say, ""Can I see the script?"""
01:09:48;01:09:50;"-Right. Sure, sure. -I just want people to understand"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"that I'm not trying to say that you should be extra mad at Kendall Jenner,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"but she and everybody who participates in commercials"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"has at least some responsibility"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"to see if there's something brutally tone-deaf about it."
01:10:01;01:10:05;"And look, maybe sometimes the rug gets pulled out from you."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"That's a little bit impossible when you're the star and you're in it."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"So look, she seems like a nice person."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"Let's just hope maybe she learned from it."
01:10:12;01:10:14;"But the idea that things like this happen"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"because of shadowy corporate people"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"and not because she's the person"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"who I'm sure got the single biggest check to participate in this,"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"probably more than the director,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"this is like a big deal."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"So anyway, I just want people to know that, like,"
01:10:29;01:10:30;"be sympathetic to her,"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"as you should be sympathetic to all human beings,"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"but don't pretend that somebody like her"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"doesn't know what's happening in the commercial."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Be sympathetic because she's young,"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"and she's, I'm sure, surrounded by a bubble,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"and so she has no context"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"for maybe understanding how that ad would resonate."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"Yeah, I guess."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"When you were 21."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"I was working a landscaping gig."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"When you were 21,"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"you had a band?"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Yeah, okay."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"You had a Guided by Voices-inspired band?"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Let's play this out."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"Let's play Devil Goes Advocate."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"I had a few bands."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"One of them was called Orlando."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"It was like a two-person punk band."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"All right, so I'm just saying,"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"this is Jake, you're Kendall Jenner's age."
01:11:05;01:11:07;"You're in college in Portland, Oregon,"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"and you got a punk band called Orlando."
01:11:09;01:11:11;"I'm also in a band called the Buff Guys."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"I like the Buff Guys name better."
01:11:12;01:11:15;"Buff Guys was like Dinosaur Jr. meets Def Leppard."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Okay, so you're in this band,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Dinosaur Jr. meets Def Leppard."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"Maybe a young cat on campus, a film studies major,"
01:11:21;01:11:25;"says, ""Jake, man, I'd love to make a Buff Guys video,"
01:11:25;01:11:27;"""and I want to screen it"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"""in front of the whole dining hall, man."""
01:11:29;01:11:31;"Are you just going to say, like,"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"""All right, Brad, make it and screen it with our music,"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"""no questions asked."""
01:11:36;01:11:38;"You might say, ""Brad, what's the idea, man?"""
01:11:38;01:11:42;"And then he says to you, ""All right, Jake, this is my idea."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"""You're modeling with a blonde wig."""
01:11:44;01:11:46;"A generic protest goes by."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"You guys are a Buff Guys practice."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"Inspired by the current struggle of black people"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"against the white supremacist police state,"
01:11:53;01:11:56;"you roll out, take the lead,"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"hand a Pepsi to the cop, everybody goes wild."
01:11:59;01:12:02;"At 21, are you doing it?"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"No, I'm not."
01:12:04;01:12:07;"I would have done some dumb stuff."
01:12:07;01:12:09;"I think you would have had half a brain"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"about what was happening in America."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Well, I don't want to be harsh on her either,"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"but I just always find that funny."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"I think the earliest stage of my life"
01:12:17;01:12:22;"that I feel like I bear zero responsibility for my mistakes,"
01:12:22;01:12:25;"I'm going to say, was 11."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Wow, that's early."
01:12:27;01:12:29;"No, but to say zero..."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"I got you, I got you."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"Because literally, when you're 12 or 13,"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"that's kind of the age where you have to start to grow up a little bit"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"and realize, ""Maybe I said something that hurt my friends' feelings."""
01:12:39;01:12:41;"That's the early version, and then, you know,"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"by the time you're a senior in high school,"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"you hopefully have a lot more perspective."
01:12:45;01:12:48;"And then by the time you're in college, it's like, ""Come on."""
01:12:48;01:12:50;"By the time I was a senior in college,"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"I don't think my demeanor has changed."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Maybe that's a bad thing."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"I don't think my demeanor's changed very much"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"since I was a senior in college."
01:12:57;01:13:00;"I think I met you then, and I don't think your demeanor has changed."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Your hair's gotten longer."
01:13:02;01:13:04;"And short. I don't know. Longer and short."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"You have a shaved head."
01:13:05;01:13:07;"One last thing with Kendall Jenner, and again,"
01:13:07;01:13:12;"I do believe that even when you're old enough to know better,"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"you're never too old to be given a second chance."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"I believe that."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"You know, people mess up and you learn."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Especially with stuff like art that's open to interpretation."
01:13:20;01:13:21;"You know, like Pepsi ads."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Like Pepsi ads."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"Artistic endeavors."
01:13:25;01:13:27;"Because you were saying maybe she lives in a bubble."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"This is like, alright, whatever. But anyway."
01:13:30;01:13:33;"We had our own little bubble."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"For a while."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Dirty projectors."
01:13:35;01:13:40;"We had our own little bubble."
01:13:40;01:13:43;"For a while."
01:13:43;01:13:46;"I'm sure Kendall is probably thinking long and hard about it,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"so don't go too hard on her, you know?"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"[laughter]"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Who knows?"
01:13:51;01:13:54;"I don't give a flying F."
01:13:54;01:13:57;"In some ways, situations like this,"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"I hate to say it, but it's like,"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"they don't make me feel like, you know what?"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"Kendall may be messed up, she'll learn a valuable lesson."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"So will her fans."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"So will the people who work at Pepsi."
01:14:08;01:14:09;"This is open and interesting."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Kind of when you get to the end of a story like this,"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"like sugar water company exploits real world stuff,"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"and then the whole debate is about,"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"well, Kendall should have known better, shouldn't she have?"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"You're kind of not left with a feeling of like,"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"we can do better."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"You're kind of left with a feeling of, nothing matters."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Literally nothing matters."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"I'll probably never think about this again."
01:14:28;01:14:29;"Like, within two weeks,"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"it'll just be completely in the rear view mirror and just like, gone."
01:14:33;01:14:36;"Well, also, I think something that's funny about this is that"
01:14:36;01:14:39;"this commercial was tone deaf."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"It was in poor taste."
01:14:40;01:14:43;"It was demeaning to the people who are out there protesting"
01:14:43;01:14:44;"for their lives, really."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"All that's true."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"But the fact, we're so far gone"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"in terms of our relationship to corporate culture and stuff,"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"Pepsi's been whittling us down for 60 years."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"Yeah, this time they kind of messed up."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"But next time, they'll do a more tasteful ad about,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"like, this is what's going to happen, by the way."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Pepsi's going to probably fire a bunch of people."
01:15:03;01:15:07;"Their next campaign is going to be like super diverse"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"and really like tackle issues."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"And then people are going to applaud them."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"And we're going to kind of forget that like,"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"we now look to sugar water companies"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"to be in charge of our culture."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"And I understand people might say, well, it is part of our culture,"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"so of course we have to critique it."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"I agree."
01:15:22;01:15:25;"But it's like, this should not be a reminder"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"that corporate branding should do better."
01:15:28;01:15:32;"This should be a reminder that like, it's all horrible"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"and like smash the state, up the workers, whatever."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Speaking of American culture, you ready for the top five?"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Oh yeah."
01:15:41;01:15:48;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:15:48;01:15:51;"Okay, we're comparing this week's top five songs on iTunes"
01:15:51;01:15:56;"to the top five Billboard hits of 1984, the year that I was born."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"The number five song this week."
01:15:57;01:15:58;"Happy birthday."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"Thank you."
01:15:59;01:16:03;"This week in 1984, ""Jump"" by Van Halen."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"I thought we might hear ""Jump."""
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Classic."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"Ooh."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"Ooh, yeah, this--"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"The wind."
01:16:10;01:16:16;"This is a deep synth sound."
01:16:16;01:16:21;"Crunchy."
01:16:21;01:16:26;"The pride of Pasadena."
01:16:26;01:16:30;"My mom's from Pasadena, and her younger brother, Ted,"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"has lived there his entire life."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"He's a rock and roll guy."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"He's played in like a million bands."
01:16:35;01:16:38;"He used to play a lot of like punk shows in the early '80s"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"with like Black Flag Circle Jerks."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Anyway."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"You know the Van Halen guys?"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Didn't know them, but he saw them play house shows."
01:16:44;01:16:49;"Picture like a crazy kegger in Pasadena in '77,"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"and it's just like 19-year-old Van Halen brothers."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"Just like shredding."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"Yeah."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Everybody's like, ""He's really one of the best guitarists"
01:16:56;01:16:57;"in the Pasadena area, man."""
01:16:57;01:16:59;"Just picture like a Richard Licklater movie."
01:16:59;01:17:03;"Everyone's just like hammered on this keg,"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"and just like David Lee Roth doing like split jumps"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"off like the porch."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"Young David Lee Roth in a garage."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"I mean, it's a classic song."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"As somebody pointed out to me recently,"
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Van Halen, they were known for guitar, man."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"They were a guitar band."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"They started in the '70s."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Eddie Van Halen's a shredder."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"So just imagine you're a kid,"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"your favorite band comes back, first single."
01:17:25;01:17:26;"Synth."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"[imitates guitar]"
01:17:27;01:17:28;"They made it work, though."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Is this off the OU812 album?"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"No, this album's called 1984."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Oh, whoa."
01:17:33;01:17:37;"♪ Oh, oh, hey you, who said that? ♪"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"David Lee Roth's vocals are so funny."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Hello!"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"He's just a hilarious dude."
01:17:42;01:17:45;"One time I saw Van Halen at a Madison Square Garden."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"What? What year?"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Like 2012."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"What the hell?"
01:17:51;01:17:52;"This is like just a music industry."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"Like somebody was like--"
01:17:53;01:17:54;"Hey, man, I'm going."
01:17:54;01:17:58;"Hey, my friend has a box at MSG for the Van Halen show."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"You want to roll?"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"I was like, all right."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"You go."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"They got like chicken fingers on deck."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Who was singing, DLR?"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"Yeah, David Lee Roth was touring with them at some point."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"And, you know, so they're just playing all the hits and it's all good."
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Yeah."
01:18:12;01:18:15;"And then at some point, he comes on stage."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"Everybody goes on stage."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"He comes back just by himself with an acoustic guitar."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"And I guess he's going to--"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"You know, they have these moments in shows where like one guy does something by himself."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Eddie shreds by himself."
01:18:24;01:18:26;"The drummer does whatever."
01:18:26;01:18:30;"So DLR comes out with an acoustic guitar, getting ready to play a song."
01:18:30;01:18:34;"And they have this like gigantic video screen behind them."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"And he just starts talking."
01:18:35;01:18:36;"It's like he's such a ham."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"He just wants to chop it up to the art."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"He's like, what up?"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"New York City."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"How you doing?"
01:18:43;01:18:47;"Then they start putting this like weird home footage up on the screen behind them."
01:18:47;01:18:48;"It's like some dogs running around."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Just like literally a camcorder in the backyard."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"And he just like turns around."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"He's like, oh, yeah, those are my dogs."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"This is in Madison Square Garden."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"Everybody's like, woo!"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"And then they cut to like some horses."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"And he's like, those are my horses."
01:19:00;01:19:01;"I own horses."
01:19:01;01:19:02;"Wow."
01:19:02;01:19:05;"And he's just like, anyway, you having a good time?"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"It was so weird."
01:19:07;01:19:12;"The number five song in 2017, Miranda Lambert."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"She's cool."
01:19:13;01:19:14;"She's a country artist."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"There's a song called Tin Man."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"So generally with country songs--"
01:19:18;01:19:19;"A lot of country recently."
01:19:19;01:19:22;"You know what a country song's about usually in the first 30 seconds?"
01:19:22;01:19:26;"Is this a cover of America's song Tin Man?"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"I wonder."
01:19:27;01:19:30;"Let's find out if we can figure out what the song's about in the first 30 seconds."
01:19:30;01:19:33;"That would be weird if she covered Tin Man."
01:19:34;01:19:38;"Uh-oh, kind of a long intro."
01:19:38;01:19:46;"Was Tin Man the guy in Wizard that didn't have a heart?"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"He didn't have a heart."
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Okay."
01:19:48;01:19:52;"Hey there, Mr. Tin Man."
01:19:52;01:19:58;"You don't know how lucky you are."
01:19:58;01:20:02;"You shouldn't spend your whole life wishing."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Okay, that was 30 seconds."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"I think I know what it's about."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"Hey, Mr. Tin Man."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"You don't know how lucky you are."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"You shouldn't spend your whole life wishing."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Upon the star."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"That she had a heart, I'm guessing."
01:20:14;01:20:15;"That he had a heart."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Okay, so I like this."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"This is interesting."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Country is a great songwriting."
01:20:19;01:20:23;"It's an interesting rejoinder because as you remember, the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz,"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"he sang a song, If I Only Had a Heart."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Right."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Because he wanted a heart so bad."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"He wanted a heart."
01:20:28;01:20:32;"Which is funny, you think you would need a heart to want a heart."
01:20:32;01:20:36;"Because a heart is like where you feel emotion and empathy and love."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"But if you didn't have any of those, then you would have no idea."
01:20:39;01:20:43;"Right, it's like Dr. Spock on Star Trek who doesn't feel emotions."
01:20:43;01:20:48;"When people talk about emotions, he's not like, oh, I wish I had some of those."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"He's like highly illogical."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"Yeah, he's not like, yes, that would be the complete spectrum of human experience."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"I wish I could experience it."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"He's like, he sees it as a deficit."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"He actually sees the inefficiency of it."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Right."
01:20:59;01:21:04;"So anyway, Wizard of Oz, totally unrealistic, two thumbs down from Time Crisis."
01:21:04;01:21:07;"But so the Tin Man, the famous song, He Wished He Had a Heart."
01:21:07;01:21:11;"So I like this because as somebody who does have a heart, a human being,"
01:21:11;01:21:15;"a humanoid Caucasian woman, Miranda Lambert,"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"as she recognizes having a heart is not all it's cracked up to be."
01:21:19;01:21:23;"That's my guess is that this song is basically like, hey, Mr. Tin Man,"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"you wish you had a heart?"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Well, guess what, you idiot?"
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Hearts break."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"Hearts hurt."
01:21:28;01:21:31;"And maybe at the end she'll be like, but also if I didn't have a heart,"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"I couldn't love my husband."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"I couldn't love my Tin Man."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"I couldn't love--"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"Who doesn't love me back."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"Let's see if we--"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Let's see what happens."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Yeah."
01:21:39;01:21:40;"[MUSIC - MIRANDA LAMBERT, ""HE WISHED HE HAD A HEART""]"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"For something bound to fall apart."
01:21:43;01:21:49;"Every time you're feeling empty."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Better thank your lucky stars."
01:21:55;01:22:01;"If you ever felt one breaking."
01:22:01;01:22:08;"You'd never want a heart."
01:22:08;01:22:10;"You don't want a heart, Mr. Tin Man?"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"No."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"Not worth it."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:22:18;01:22:24;"Very vibe-y."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"This performance actually feels kind of live."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"Yeah, it's not like super--"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"It seems like--"
01:22:29;01:22:31;"You don't know how lucky you are."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"She's like singing and playing the guitar,"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"and then they added that washy synth."
01:22:35;01:22:38;"I've been on the road that you're on."
01:22:38;01:22:44;"It didn't get me very far."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"You ain't missing nothing."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"You ain't missing nothing, Mr. Tin Man."
01:22:52;01:22:57;"This love is so damn hard."
01:22:57;01:23:02;"Take it from me, darling."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"These lyrics--"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"I like them."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"--are very straightforward."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"You don't want a heart."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"You don't want a heart, Mr. Tin Man."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"I like it."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"Is there a chorus?"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"All right."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"It's kind of-- Whatever."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"It's a vibe-y song."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"I'm gonna write a song."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"You remember the other characters in The Wizard of Oz?"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"If I only had a brain?"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"No."
01:23:25;01:23:26;"Scarecrow."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"Scarecrow wants a brain, and the lion wants courage?"
01:23:29;01:23:30;"Yeah."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"But that's not an organ."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"Well, he wants a gallbladder."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"He wants a set of balls."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Hey there, Mr. Scarecrow."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Did you see King Kong, by the way?"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"The original film of the--"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"No."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"--of course, yeah."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"The new one."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Oh, no, the new one, no."
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Is it good?"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"Where's Kong?"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"And balls."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Oh, he doesn't have it?"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"No."
01:23:52;01:23:53;"Really?"
01:23:53;01:23:57;"There's, like, shots of him running, like, full frontal King Kong, running at the characters,"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"full blast."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"And you're just like--"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"Nobody's trying to see that."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"There's no way."
01:24:03;01:24:08;"Anyway, I want to make a song going out to the Scarecrow."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"He wants a brain."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Do you ever wish you didn't have a brain, man?"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"That thought has never occurred to me."
01:24:15;01:24:22;"You ever get, like, super high, and you're just laughing at some dumb thing, and you'd"
01:24:22;01:24:26;"be like, ""Man, why can't life always be like this?"""
01:24:26;01:24:27;"Yeah, I've had that--"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"--real stupid."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"I've had that experience."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Or even just drunk."
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Drunk or high, and you're just, like, you're just being dumb, and you're just cracking"
01:24:33;01:24:34;"up at nothing."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"And you're just there, just looking around."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"You don't need anything fancy to entertain yourself."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"You don't need some intellectual conversation."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"I love it."
01:24:42;01:24:46;"And you just kind of think to yourself, like, ""It's cool to be dumb."""
01:24:46;01:24:48;"Hey there, Mr. Scarecrow."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Back to 1984."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"Eurythmics."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"Great group."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"Annie Lennox, Dave Stewart."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Here comes the rain again."
01:25:11;01:25:14;"Trends come and go now, but imagine the ten years between '74 and '84."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Oh, yeah, crazy."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"Just how different the stuff on the radio sounds."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Just, like, truly new technology."
01:25:19;01:25:20;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"We have little bits of that today, but not quite as extreme."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"It's not--yeah."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Great voice."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Emotion."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"Those strings are still pretty, like, '70s, like, disco string."
01:26:06;01:26:08;"Oh, I didn't even realize this was the same song."
01:26:20;01:26:21;"Where was this band from?"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"I don't know anything about the Eurythmics."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"English duo."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Okay."
01:26:27;01:26:30;"It's weird to think about them playing, like, early club gigs."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"I wonder if they were bros with, like, Kate Bush."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"I bet they crossed paths."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"Yeah."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"So it was, like, Annie Lennox and then Dave Stewart."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Wait, who's Dave Stewart?"
01:26:37;01:26:39;"He was, like, I think more the producer guy,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"and maybe they wrote the songs together and she was the singer."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"Was he in some, like, '70s prog band?"
01:26:43;01:26:46;"I don't know, but he went on to, like, produce for Tom Petty."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"He produced ""Don't Come Around Here No More."""
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Okay."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"And then Annie Lennox went on to have a great solo career."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Yep."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"""Walking on Broken Glass,"" one of my all-time favorites."
01:26:56;01:26:58;"Back to our present day."
01:26:58;01:27:01;"We cannot keep this guy out of the top five."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Sheeran?"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"Sheeran, ""Shape of You."""
01:27:04;01:27:05;"This is, like, officially just, like--"
01:27:05;01:27:07;"So it's falling in the charts."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"Yeah, fell to number four."
01:27:09;01:27:12;"It's been number one for months."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"Oh, I actually had a thought about this song the other day."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"Yeah?"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"We've talked about this song so many times,"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"we have to find new angles now."
01:27:17;01:27:20;"We can't keep talking about the bed sheets."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"I just started to think a lot about the opening line."

01:27:39;01:27:41;"You're doing the whole music industry proud."

01:27:51;01:27:52;"Wait, is it lover?"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"He said lover, he said mate."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"Mate's like your friend."
01:27:55;01:27:58;"You think this whole song is about appreciating his buddy's body?"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"That'd be a cool idea for a pop song."
01:28:00;01:28:06;"There aren't enough, like, non-romantic, platonic body appreciation things."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Because people--"

01:29:31;01:29:32;"It turns out to be more, but--"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"He's on the prowl."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"If you're looking for a boyfriend or girlfriend,"
01:29:35;01:29:39;"you don't say, ""You're not going to find a girlfriend at the club."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"""You're going to find a girlfriend at the bar."""
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Your friends would be like,"
01:29:41;01:29:44;"""There's a lot of other places you could find a girlfriend."""
01:29:44;01:29:47;"You know, ""My cousin just moved here,"" whatever."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"But anyway, he's talking about sex."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"She's single. She just broke up with her fiancé."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"[laughter]"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"But anyway, we know that he's talking about sex"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"when we really break it down, which is fine."
01:29:57;01:30:01;"It's a classic part of what it means, you know, being a human being."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"So the club is not the best place to find a lover."
01:30:03;01:30:06;"So basically, in his head, he's thinking,"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"""Ed Sheeran wants sex tonight."""
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Yeah."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"And then he's going through a mental checklist."
01:30:12;01:30:14;"Where is Ed Sheeran going to find sex?"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"The club."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Is it going to be the club?"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"No, for whatever reason--"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"You know, some of those Jersey Shore guys,"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"they tend to find sex at the club."
01:30:20;01:30:21;"Not Ed Sheeran."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Not much of a dancer."
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Where does Ed Sheeran find sex? The bar."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"So the bar is where I go."
01:30:27;01:30:30;"And what do I do to get the sex at the bar?"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"I do a lot of shots very quickly with my friends,"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"and then I go up and speak slowly to women."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"You get hammered."
01:30:37;01:30:38;"[laughter]"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"And when you kind of think about it--"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"You stumble up to women."
01:30:40;01:30:43;"Suddenly, the song sounds a lot less sexy."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"Maybe it never sounded sexy."
01:30:45;01:30:48;"And they're going to end up at a Chinese place."
01:30:48;01:30:51;"Yeah, at the cheap Chinese buffet."
01:30:51;01:30:55;"The song is actually kind of amazingly realistic."
01:30:55;01:30:56;"Yeah, realistic."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"Like, brutal realism."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Nothing suave about it."
01:31:00;01:31:01;"His delivery is kind of suave."
01:31:01;01:31:03;"[singing] The club isn't the best place to find a lover."
01:31:03;01:31:04;"So the bar--"
01:31:04;01:31:05;"But really, when you break it down,"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"this is a dude being like,"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"""I can't pull at the club."""
01:31:08;01:31:09;"""You always get girls at the club,"
01:31:09;01:31:10;"but I never get girls at the club."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"We're going to the bar."""
01:31:11;01:31:13;"This is like a Kevin Smith movie."
01:31:13;01:31:14;"Yeah, exactly."
01:31:14;01:31:20;"They're going to end up crushing Chinese food."
01:31:20;01:31:21;"It's like--"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"At 2 a.m.?"
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Ed Sheeran's like,"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"""So when I'm trying to get a woman,"
01:31:25;01:31:27;"I always go to the bar"

01:31:31;01:31:34;"Getting blackout drunk is what gets me women."""
01:31:34;01:31:36;"But the problem is--"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"Picturing Jay and Silent Bob"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"rolling with Ed Sheeran."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"In the movie, it's Kevin, James,"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"and Jay and Silent Bob together."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"And then they get there, look around at the girls,"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"and it's like, ""All right, fellas,"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"five shots, five minutes, let's do this."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"Get blackout drunk."""
01:31:52;01:31:54;"But then the thing is,"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"when you drink that much--"
01:31:56;01:31:57;"Wait, what are they--"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Is that Dutch courage,"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"is when you get drunk enough"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"to do something you wouldn't normally do?"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"So Ed finally gets drunk enough to go over to the--"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"When he says, ""We talk slow,"" he means slurring."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"I go over to a girl, ""Hey, I'm Ed Sheeran."""
01:32:10;01:32:12;"And then he's like, ""You want to go back to my place?"""
01:32:12;01:32:13;"And she's like, ""I guess."""
01:32:13;01:32:15;"And he's like, ""Actually--"""
01:32:15;01:32:16;"I'm f*cking hungry."
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Let's go to the Chinese buffet place."
01:32:19;01:32:20;"I'm starving."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"I drank way too much, way too quick."
01:32:22;01:32:25;"I'm so hungry."
01:32:25;01:32:28;"I could murder a plate of orange chicken right now."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"Hungry as f*ck right now."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"And then they get there, and then finally--"
01:32:32;01:32:34;"This place better have beer."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Oh, he's still drinking."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Drinking at the Chinese place."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"At the Chinese place."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"And that's when he says, ""Fill up your bag."""

01:33:01;01:33:04;"Biggest hit of the year."

01:33:06;01:33:08;"Everyone can relate, man."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"Yeah, you're right."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"A lot of people get drunk as a way to loosen up,"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"which is not a bad thing."
01:33:14;01:33:17;"It's just like a shame."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"I would just say to the younger folks listening,"
01:33:20;01:33:23;"when you're Ed Sheeran's age and you want to go have sex,"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"learn to dance."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"That's what I'm saying, because then you can go to the club,"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"you can strut your stuff,"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"you don't have to get blackout drunk."
01:33:30;01:33:33;"In fact, you're getting exercise."
01:33:33;01:33:34;"You're drinking a vitamin water."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"You're drinking a vitamin water, you're moving,"
01:33:37;01:33:38;"you're feeling good."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"You can meet somebody at the club,"
01:33:40;01:33:42;"and also if they want to talk,"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"you want to go to the quieter part of the club and we'll talk."
01:33:45;01:33:46;"Bars are so loud anyway."
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Quieter part of the club."
01:33:48;01:33:49;"It exists."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Let's go stand outside for a second."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Sometimes you need a couple drinks to give you,"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"as you said, the courage."
01:33:54;01:33:57;"I just don't like this dichotomy that he's setting up."
01:33:57;01:34:00;"It's hard to imagine just dancing in a club sober."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Well, exactly, but you know what I realize?"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I don't have a confidence."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"I'm a terrible dancer."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"I can relate to Ed here."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"I'm a terrible dancer too,"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"but I've been learning some dance moves recently."
01:34:08;01:34:09;"Really?"
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Kind of."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Interesting."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"I was learning this dance move that's kind of--"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"it's a classic basic dance move,"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"but it's associated with Morris Day and the time"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"where your legs kind of swing."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"I just wanted to learn it."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"Then I was at a party and everybody just started doing it,"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"and I was like, ""You know what?"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"""When you actually learn a dance move,"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"""you kind of just want to keep doing it."
01:34:26;01:34:28;"""You actually want to play music and work."""
01:34:28;01:34:29;"It's like exercising."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Right, right, okay."
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Whatever."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"I mean, maybe people disagree."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"That's my entry."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"So anyway, I just want to say to Ed,"
01:34:34;01:34:38;"I'm not judging, but don't write off the club."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Maybe in a year or two,"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"he'll come out with his club version."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"You know what's funny?"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"They probably play this song in clubs."
01:34:42;01:34:43;"Totally."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"So imagine you're on the dance floor--"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"And in Chinese restaurants."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"And in Chinese--"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"[laughs]"
01:34:47;01:34:48;"And in cabs."

01:35:03;01:35:04;"And someone edited it,"

01:53:53;01:53:55;"- Not poppy, not innocuous,"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"not benign. - And he says a lot"

01:53:59;01:54:01;"you might appreciate this."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"There's a Grey Poupon reference."
01:54:03;01:54:05;"- Love a Grey Poupon, ref."

01:54:07;01:54:09;"that Evian, that TED Talk."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"Those are three interesting things to reference."
01:54:11;01:54:13;"What are those things that are in common?"
01:54:13;01:54:15;"They're all kind of, like, bougie. - Yeah."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"Grey Poupon's kind of, like, old-school"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"reference, though. He could have done a better job"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"with that. - How old is Kendrick?"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- Like, 27? Grey Poupon"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"is, like, in those ads from the '90s."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"- Yeah, I think they're probably from the '80s"
01:54:27;01:54:29;"originally. - It should have been, like, kombucha"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"or something, right? - Kendrick's"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"29. I wonder if, like,"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"the younger fans are familiar with the Grey"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"Poupon reference. - Right."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"- He references in the video, too. He rolls up"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"in a car and rolls down the window. - Oh, wow."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Yeah, 'cause Grey Poupon was at its height culturally"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"like 30 years ago. - Did your family"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"have Grey Poupon at home? - No."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"We had no mustard. - Not a mustard"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"household? - My dad had a strict no mustard"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"policy. - Really?"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Do you have ketchup? - Yeah."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- And what did you use ketchup on? Burgers?"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"- Yeah, stuff like that. - Hot dogs?"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"- Yeah. - Speak more on that."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"- Yeah, there's a story behind it."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"When he was in college,"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"he, like,"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"had, like, poison oak or something really bad."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"- Mm-hmm. - You know, like, poison ivy"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"kind of thing? - Yeah. - And he got up in the middle of the night"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"and, like, went to the medicine cabinet and, like, he thought"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"he, like, had grabbed the, like..."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"- Calamine lotion? - Yeah, whatever. Like,"
01:55:19;01:55:21;"the Benadryl-- No, no, something he would take orally."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Like, the Benadryl. And, like, took"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"a slug. And then, like, it tasted weird. He opened it"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"and turned on the light, and it was, like, his roommate's, like,"
01:55:27;01:55:29;"skin ointment or something."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"And there was, like, a poisonous,"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"like, school-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"He thought he was drinking Benadryl,"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"but he was-- - He was drinking some sort of, like,"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"medicinal thing that you would not take orally."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Something you would, like, rub on your skin."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"His roommate's stuff. And then"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"so they had to go to the hospital,"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"and they had to pump his stomach, but they had to induce"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"vomiting, and they made him chug, like,"
01:55:49;01:55:51;"mustard and milk?"
01:55:51;01:55:53;"- Ooh. - They, like, mixed, like, a half gallon"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"of mustard and milk, and, like--"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"picture my dad, like, 18 and, like,"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"19...66 or whatever."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"Just, like, pounding"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"mustard and milk."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"And then vomiting up all this weird"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"topical medicine he'd drink."
01:56:07;01:56:09;"- Ugh. - Ever since then."
01:56:09;01:56:11;"No mustard. - Damn."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"And do you like mustard? - Love it."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"- [laughs]"
01:56:15;01:56:17;"- It's a bit of a contentious issue within the house."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"- Even though you didn't have it?"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"- Grew to love it later. - Right."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"[laughs] Man, you must"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"have some real sh-- barbecues."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"- I know. Can you imagine?"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"- What'd you have? Just, like, ketchup and relish?"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"- I don't think we even did relish."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"- [laughs] Just ketchup."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"- Man, you're a kid. That works."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"- Yeah, you're right. It works."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"- Ugh. - Well, that was this week's"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"top five. Extraordinary."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"- KLs."
01:56:43;01:56:45;"- Every generation has a KL."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"- I wonder what Loggins thinks of, uh,"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"Kendrick. He might-- - And vice"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"versa. - I could imagine there"
01:56:51;01:56:53;"being some mutual respect there. I think--"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"- Yeah? - Yeah, Kenny Loggins, I believe."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"I think he might live up in Santa Barbara"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"or something. - That's tight."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"- Two SoCal guys."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"- That's tight. - [laughs]"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Don't quote me on that. Anyway,"
01:57:05;01:57:07;"that was a hell of a time crisis, Jake. We held it"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"down. No guests."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"No Seinfeld 2000. Well, we did have"
01:57:11;01:57:13;"Deezus on the phone. Thank you, Deezus, for calling in."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"No in-person guests and no"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"Seinfeld 2000. All we had"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"was our wits"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"and the news."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"- And a lot of great tunes. - And a lot of great"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"tunes. - And"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"my ribs! - And my ribs!"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"- I want my ribs to be the"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"new, uh, ""In My Neighborhood."""
01:57:31;01:57:33;"- ""In My Neighborhood, my ribs!"""
01:57:33;01:57:35;"It's the end of a horrible"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"rom-com. I guess they don't even really make those movies"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"anymore. Or maybe they do."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Jake, we just got word."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"Kendrick and Kenny Loggins, almost certainly."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"I'm not saying they've met each other,"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"but they're at most one degree"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"of connection away. - Whoa."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"- They're literally both guests"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"on the last Thundercat album, which came"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"out a couple months ago. - That's"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"sick. - So you know what, man? A lot of people think"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"that Kendrick, Lamar, Kenny Loggins, yeah,"
01:57:59;01:58:01;"they have the same initials. They both have topped"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"the charts. But what do they have to do with each"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"other? That's real close-minded. They have"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"a lot to do with each other. They've even appeared on the"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"same record. So shout-out to Thundercat,"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"'cause without you, people might not"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"understand that these guys aren't that different."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"And one last thing I want to say."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"Pepsi,"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"take a good hard look in the mirror at what"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"you've become. 'Cause here"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"in Time Crisis, we see the real you."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"You're a kitchen cola, a"
01:58:25;01:58:27;"bargain brand. You're"
01:58:27;01:58:29;"Brad's Drink. And you know what? It's okay to be"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"Brad's Drink. Don't mess with things you"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"don't understand. We'll see you in two weeks."
