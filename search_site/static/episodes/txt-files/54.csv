00:00;00:02;"Jake, I want you to do the intro today."
00:02;00:07;"Okay, this week on Time Crisis, we talk Whole Foods Amazon."
00:07;00:10;"We talk... what else do we talk?"
00:10;00:14;"We talk Neil Young getting political about Monsanto."
00:14;00:17;"We talk about Eminem."
00:17;00:22;"We do the Top 5 from '78, which is touch and go."
00:22;00:24;"All coming up on this week's..."
00:24;00:28;"Time Crisis with Eds from Caden."
00:28;00:30;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:30;00:32;"Spook 1."
00:33;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:39;00:46;"They were a friend who I believed, all my rightful chances"
00:46;00:53;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:53;01:00;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:00;01:05;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:05;01:11;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:11;01:15;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:15;01:19;"Time Crisis. Back in the building."
01:19;01:21;"What's up, Jake?"
01:21;01:22;"Hey."
01:22;01:23;"How's it going?"
01:23;01:26;"Good. I feel, uh, harried."
01:26;01:29;"Yeah, me too. Do you think it's just the atmosphere?"
01:29;01:34;"You think it's like the wildfires, smoke, the government?"
01:34;01:36;"What's going on, man?"
01:36;01:38;"Yeah, that's contributing for sure."
01:38;01:43;"But I also just am juggling a lot of things in my personal life."
01:43;01:47;"Yeah? Being married's not all fun and games, huh?"
01:47;01:48;"Two weeks in."
01:48;01:52;"Marriage is work. Let me tell you."
01:52;01:54;"The old adage is true."
01:54;01:57;"I've heard that, marriage is work."
01:57;02:01;"That is the most uninspiring, bummer vibe."
02:01;02:06;"When you're 17 and your uncle's just like, ""Marriage is work."""
02:06;02:10;"Yeah, also because you never know what people actually mean by that."
02:10;02:13;"Because some people are probably trying to tell you"
02:13;02:17;"relationships aren't always easy and you have to, you know,"
02:17;02:21;"it can be exhausting, but the joy of a partnership is"
02:21;02:24;"working hard to make somebody else happy."
02:24;02:26;"I don't know, there's that side of it."
02:26;02:29;"And then there's this other side when people say that s*** that's just like,"
02:29;02:33;"""I'm not allowed to get divorced, and I'm mad."""
02:33;02:36;"Right, yeah, and when you're 17 and you're hearing this from some adult,"
02:36;02:41;"you're just like, ""Ugh, I've never dated anyone."""
02:41;02:42;"Right."
02:42;02:47;"""I'm a virgin."" I don't know what you're talking about right now."
02:47;02:53;"Marriage is-- what are you telling me, don't get married?"
02:53;02:54;"Yeah."
02:54;02:58;"I would expect that more if some weird older family member was just like,"
02:58;03:00;"""Don't get married, here's why."""
03:00;03:02;"I'd be like, ""Alright, at least that's a point of view."""
03:02;03:05;"It's not some vague, mysterious complaint."
03:05;03:07;"Just disgruntlement."
03:07;03:09;"Disgruntlement, is that a word?"
03:09;03:10;"I think so."
03:10;03:12;"Anyway, I'm good. I'm good."
03:12;03:16;"No, I do think there's been something in the air recently."
03:16;03:19;"I mean, that's a weird thing to say when more or less everybody's felt"
03:19;03:23;"kind of harried, depressed, scared for almost two years straight."
03:23;03:26;"But there was something about the last few weeks that specifically felt--"
03:26;03:30;"it's October, it's a spooky month, always."
03:30;03:33;"So there's a weird intersection of things happening."
05:11;05:15;"We thought maybe we would talk a little bit about the Amazon Whole Foods merger."
05:15;05:18;"I can't even remember if we ever talked about that on the show."
05:18;05:21;"We didn't, and then on Twitter someone requested it."
05:21;05:22;"Yeah."
05:22;05:24;"Because it seemed pretty on-brand for the show."
05:24;05:27;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
05:27;05:30;"Let's talk about it."
05:30;05:36;"It is on-brand. It might almost be one of the situations something's too on-brand."
05:36;05:40;"Yeah, I looked into it. It sounds a lot sexier than it actually is."
05:40;05:44;"It sounds like dystopian and messed up."
05:44;05:49;"Whole Foods is going to offer points of purchase discounts to Whole Foods customers."
05:49;05:51;"It's like, ""Cool!"""
05:51;05:55;"It's just run-of-the-mill dystopian. It's not the extra dystopian."
05:55;05:57;"It's sort of like, ""Oh, this way."""
05:57;06:02;"So Amazon now owns all 493 Whole Foods locations."
06:02;06:03;"Is that how many there are?"
06:03;06:04;"Yeah. So it's not that many."
06:04;06:07;"I feel like... We're actually sidebar."
06:07;06:15;"I have a good memory of one time Jake and I were on a Christmas vacation together in Hawaii."
06:15;06:16;"Oh, yeah."
06:16;06:18;"And we were there with a bunch of friends."
06:18;06:24;"And I feel like that was the time we spent a lot of time guessing how many Whole Foods were in various states."
06:24;06:26;"Right, right. Like, ""Okay, Oklahoma. How many Whole Foods?"""
06:26;06:29;"And I was like, ""Okay, probably Oklahoma City."""
06:29;06:30;"Just breaking it down."
06:30;06:32;"Maybe Tulsa."
06:32;06:36;"Greater Tulsa, two? Three? Four? I don't even remember anymore."
06:36;06:40;"But I just love that we were in this beautiful tropical beach locale."
06:40;06:45;"And definitely our heads were staring at our phones just guessing."
06:45;06:49;"How many Whole Foods are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area?"
06:49;06:51;"Four?"
06:51;06:53;"Four. That's what I was going to guess."
06:53;06:55;"So Amazon bought all these stores."
06:55;06:57;"I read a few articles today and it was sort of like..."
06:57;07:04;"There was this recurring theme in the articles that was like, ""Amazon now owns these stores, which are going to be great hubs."""
07:04;07:08;"Because they're in that kind of affluent urban areas for the most part."
07:08;07:14;"So they're going to be great hubs for Amazon to kind of leech onto that and start doing all their delivery through that."
07:14;07:17;"It's basically like infrastructure."
07:17;07:21;"And then it's encouraging people to sign up for Amazon Prime."
07:21;07:23;"It's like really banal."
07:23;07:30;"It's just like, ""Oh yeah, okay. These huge companies merging. Economies of scale. The whole nine yards."""
07:30;07:32;"It's just sort of like, ""All right."""
07:32;07:36;"Okay. By the way, four Whole Foods in the St. Paul."
07:36;07:37;"Oh, we nailed that."
07:37;07:39;"Yeah, we nailed that Minneapolis region."
07:39;07:47;"Okay, but I don't want to minimize the fact that it is giant monopolies and companies coming together."
07:47;07:48;"It's weird."
07:48;07:49;"Yeah."
07:49;07:54;"I think the reason maybe this one bugs people out more is because it involves..."
07:54;07:55;"It's so flagship."
07:55;07:57;"It involves food too."
07:57;07:58;"Right."
07:58;08:09;"So probably for the average Whole Foods liberal, there's a feeling of just like, ""Wait, a big corporation is going to own my food source?"""
08:09;08:13;"It's like, ""Guess what, buddy? They already did."""
08:13;08:21;"I'm just saying this is going to bug a certain type of person out more than the AOL-Time Warner merger."
08:21;08:24;"It's also classic Walmart style."
08:24;08:27;"""Well, prices are going to drop for consumers."""
08:27;08:28;"Right."
08:28;08:32;"I've read some various polls. I don't know how real they are."
08:32;08:38;"They were just sort of like, ""86% of consumers approve the merger because it's going to drop prices at Whole Foods."""
08:38;08:43;"Then you can open that whole can of worms of like, ""Well, how does this affect the production line?"""
08:43;08:49;"Wasn't Whole Foods already kind of like a sellout a la Ben & Jerry's?"
08:49;08:55;"Like, already Whole Foods is like this and that's not organic, and there's kind of like a growing backlash to Whole Foods."
08:55;09:03;"There was one parallel that I thought was interesting that someone wrote about, which was how Amazon is sort of following the footsteps of Sears."
09:03;09:09;"In the sense that Sears was like the big retailer of the early, mid-20th century."
09:09;09:12;"And Sears started as a catalog."
09:12;09:17;"It was like a 500-page catalog that would show up at your door, and you'd order things from the Sears catalog."
09:17;09:22;"And then as the populations in the city started to expand, they started opening stores."
09:22;09:29;"They opened like 300 stores in the 1920s in different cities in America because it was all about proximity."
09:29;09:30;"People were there."
09:30;09:31;"Right."
09:31;09:39;"So it was like you could order an appliance or some hardware equipment from the Sears catalog, or you could just go down the street to the Sears."
09:39;09:40;"Right."
09:40;09:44;"So in a sense, it was like Amazon started as essentially a catalog."
09:44;09:47;"You'd go online and you'd order stuff."
09:47;09:52;"And now Amazon is sort of getting into the brick-and-mortar world because of proximity."
09:52;10:02;"So it's interesting to think that there's an old-school version of mail order to brick-and-mortar because I think in our times, we experience the opposite."
10:02;10:08;"So we think that modernization is all about the destruction of brick-and-mortar and things moving on to, you know."
10:08;10:09;"Yeah, but it's true."
10:09;10:13;"There are situations where you're like, ""Well, I don't want to wait till tomorrow."
10:13;10:15;"I'm driving home."
10:15;10:18;"I'm going to make dinner."
10:18;10:21;"I need to get this and this and this to make dinner."""
10:21;10:24;"People don't plan that intensely where they're like--"
10:24;10:26;"You can't order everything."
10:26;10:31;"Yeah, there is still value in going to a place that's near your home to buy things."
10:31;10:32;"Right."
10:32;10:34;"I want to bandage this wound today."
10:34;10:36;"I got to deal with this right now."
10:36;10:38;"I need diapers now."
10:38;10:40;"I can't wait."
10:40;10:42;"So I can relate."
10:42;10:43;"Totally."
10:43;10:44;"Do you use that Instacart?"
10:44;10:45;"Yeah, I've used it."
10:45;10:48;"You can't squeeze the fruit with it, though."
10:48;10:49;"You kind of leave it to the other people."
10:49;10:50;"I agree."
10:50;10:51;"You know?"
10:51;10:53;"What, Instacart is just--they shop for you?"
10:53;10:55;"Yeah, you know what's funny?"
10:55;11:00;"I used to work for a company in San Francisco called Shop Hoppers, which has come up before on the program."
11:00;11:05;"This is when I used to run into Kirk Hammett at the Whole Foods in San Francisco."
11:05;11:16;"He'd be like very nimbly parking his white Escalade between two concrete pillars, and it'd be like an eighth of an inch on either side."
11:16;11:20;"I worked for this company, Shop Hoppers, which was a shopping and delivery service."
11:20;11:21;"Shop Hoppers?"
11:21;11:22;"Shop Hoppers."
11:22;11:23;"Hoppers with a P?"
11:23;11:24;"No, Hop."
11:24;11:25;"Hop."
11:25;11:26;"Shop."
11:26;11:27;"Hop."
11:27;11:28;"One word?"
11:28;11:29;"Yep, Shop Hoppers."
11:29;11:31;"Capital H or lowercase h, one word."
11:31;11:34;"Was it a--would the people order online or on the phone?"
11:34;11:36;"This was circa 2005."
11:36;11:39;"Phone or email."
11:39;11:45;"They would email my boss, this guy named Chris Ford, and it would just be like, ""Three avocados."
11:45;11:46;"Two papayas."
11:46;11:48;"One head of kale."""
11:48;11:52;"Because the computer programming wasn't advanced enough that it was still just sending an email?"
11:52;12:00;"No, this was a local San Francisco business that operated out of the two locations of Whole Foods in San Francisco."
12:00;12:04;"There was one in Soma, and there was one on California and Franklin."
12:04;12:05;"That's so quaint."
12:05;12:06;"So they would just email--"
12:06;12:07;"Yep."
12:07;12:08;"""Hey, Chris."
12:08;12:09;"It's Marv."
12:09;12:14;"I've got some company coming over later."
12:14;12:16;"I'd like to make some guacamole."
12:16;12:20;"Let me get--"" and then he'd print it out and be like, ""Here, Jake."""
12:20;12:21;"Yep."
12:21;12:23;"It literally was a printout?"
12:23;12:24;"I didn't do a lot of shopping."
12:24;12:26;"I was driving, primarily."
12:26;12:27;"So there'd be--"
12:27;12:28;"Oh, what?"
12:28;12:29;"There was a buddy system?"
12:29;12:30;"No, no."
12:30;12:31;"He had people shopping."
12:31;12:32;"Chris had--"
12:32;12:33;"Why wouldn't--"
12:33;12:35;"Chris had a small office in Franklin."
12:35;12:37;"There were shoppers and hoppers?"
12:37;12:38;"Yes, exactly."
12:38;12:41;"Why would that not be one person, like Postmates or Uber Eats?"
12:41;12:42;"Or Instacart."
12:43;12:44;"I think the shoppers are the hoppers."
12:44;12:45;"Really?"
12:45;12:46;"I think the shoppers are the hoppers."
12:46;12:47;"I did do some shopping."
12:47;12:49;"I think it should have been that he prints out the email, gives it to Jake, Jake jumps"
12:49;12:51;"in the minivan, rolls to Whole Foods--"
12:51;12:52;"No, no, no."
12:52;12:54;"--buys the guacamole ingredients, brings it to the guy's house."
12:54;12:56;"This is before smartphones."
12:56;12:57;"I wasn't getting email on my phone."
12:57;12:59;"I would go to Chris's office."
12:59;13:01;"I would get the printed out email."
13:01;13:02;"Yes."
13:02;13:03;"Then--"
13:03;13:05;"Well, no, see, I wouldn't do that."
13:05;13:06;"Here's what happened."
13:06;13:09;"He would give the printout email to a shopper."
13:09;13:11;"They would shop at the Whole Foods."
13:11;13:12;"They'd complete the order."
13:12;13:14;"How did they get to the Whole Foods?"
13:14;13:15;"They were there."
13:15;13:16;"They were at the Whole Foods."
13:16;13:17;"That was their shift."
13:17;13:18;"Lurking?"
13:19;13:20;"No, that was their shift."
13:20;13:21;"Wait, did they work at Whole Foods?"
13:21;13:24;"No, they were shop hoppers' employees, independent contractors."
13:24;13:26;"How did they get the printout?"
13:26;13:29;"Chris had an office at the Franklin Avenue Whole Foods."
13:29;13:30;"Oh, okay, sorry."
13:30;13:31;"I misunderstood."
13:31;13:34;"With a computer and a printer."
13:34;13:35;"And Chris would be on the cell phone, stressed out."
13:35;13:39;"You mean Whole Foods gave this dude office space for his weird startup?"
13:39;13:40;"Yes."
13:41;13:42;"That's pretty cool."
13:42;13:43;"He's gone now."
13:43;13:44;"I have a feeling-"
13:44;13:45;"This was a very local, grandfathered-in situation."
13:45;13:51;"I think he was just hanging out in the sit-down area of the Whole Foods with a laptop."
13:51;13:53;"Probably some of that, too."
13:53;13:55;"Okay, so-"
13:55;14:00;"So then I pull up at the loading dock of the Franklin Whole Foods or the Soma."
14:00;14:03;"Okay, so cell phones were in use, but not smartphones."
14:03;14:05;"So I'd get a call."
14:05;14:06;"You'd flip that flip phone open."
14:06;14:09;"Jake, we got three orders for you at the Soma Whole Foods."
14:09;14:15;"So I'd go down to the Soma Whole Foods, like on 4th and Bryan or whatever it is, pull into"
14:15;14:16;"the loading dock."
14:16;14:24;"There'd be grocery orders sitting in a cart, ready to go, with the invoice on it."
14:24;14:25;"I'd wheel the cart to my minivan."
14:25;14:28;"They'd be sitting there unattended?"
14:28;14:29;"In the walk-in."
14:29;14:31;"Yes, unattended."
14:31;14:32;"Really the shopper wouldn't-"
14:32;14:34;"No, I mean-"
14:34;14:35;"That's precious cargo."
14:35;14:39;"But a Whole Foods employee is not going to jack stuff out of the bag."
14:39;14:42;"They had the name of each person stapled on them or something?"
14:42;14:43;"Exactly."
14:43;14:44;"Okay."
14:44;14:45;"So this is like a sleeper cell."
14:45;14:47;"The shoppers and the hoppers never met."
14:47;14:48;"No, I knew them."
14:48;14:49;"Okay."
14:49;14:51;"All right, it's not a sleeper cell."
14:51;14:52;"This is so deep."
14:52;14:54;"So then, all right, so you're saying that-"
14:54;14:59;"Basically, this is proto-Amazon Whole Foods merger."
14:59;15:00;"This is so old."
15:00;15:01;"Pre-smartphones, it was crazy."
15:01;15:02;"I know."
15:02;15:03;"We'd standing orders."
15:03;15:04;"There was this one guy."
15:04;15:09;"He would order yogurt and granola and bananas, just a tiny order."
15:09;15:10;"Yeah."
15:10;15:14;"And he's like, ""I'm at my apartment from 2 to 3 p.m. every Saturday."
15:14;15:18;"Get there between 2 and 3, and there's a $20 tip in it for you."""
15:18;15:19;"And he was getting his-"
15:19;15:20;"So I would make that happen."
15:20;15:21;"He was getting his week's worth?"
15:21;15:22;"I think he was like a lawyer."
15:22;15:27;"He would just get up at the crack of dawn, eat yogurt and granola, and hit the road,"
15:27;15:29;"and then just be gone all day."
15:29;15:32;"And so yeah, that was just like his breakfast for the whole week."
15:32;15:35;"He was like a typical Silicon Valley weirdo."
15:35;15:36;"It was Zuckerberg."
15:36;15:39;"Maybe it was, man."
15:39;15:41;"$20 for driving two blocks."
15:41;15:43;"Oh, not bad."
21:54;21:58;"Well, I'm sure there's a lot deeper that we could go on Amazon Whole Foods."
21:58;22:01;"But, well, we'll have to keep researching, I think."
22:01;22:05;"But Seinfeld, you said that now they put Alexas in the bananas?"
22:05;22:07;"Yeah, they got Alexa in the banana."
22:07;22:08;"What's that?"
22:08;22:11;"Well, Alexa's like one of those home devices."
22:11;22:15;"It's like Google Home or Siri. Alexa, you know."
22:15;22:20;"It's kind of like Siri. It's a cylinder. You talk to it and you could say--"
22:20;22:23;"Hey, Alexa, play some classical. And boom."
22:23;22:25;"But it's in the bananas? What do you mean?"
22:25;22:30;"So Alexa's a product that Amazon makes, and I guess now they're sticking them in the bananas at Whole Foods?"
22:30;22:35;"Yeah, so you're strolling around and, you know, you go to your produce or whatever, the fruit section,"
22:35;22:40;"and you'll see, like, just a little Alexa poking its head out of the bananas."
22:40;22:41;"I'm confused."
22:41;22:46;"They've just sort of stuck some of their electronic gadgets among the foods is what I'm saying."
22:46;22:48;"And that happened right after the merger."
22:48;22:55;"This would be like if Apple bought Chipotle, and then in between the Pinto and the black beans,"
22:55;22:58;"they just stuck an iPhone 8."
22:58;23:00;"An iPod Mini."
23:00;23:02;"Don't make those anymore."
23:02;23:03;"Oh, they don't?"
23:03;23:05;"I don't think so. I don't think they make any kind of iPods anymore."
23:05;23:06;"Really?"
23:06;23:07;"Yeah."
23:07;23:08;"God."
23:08;23:09;"iPod's over."
23:09;23:10;"Apple bought Chipotle."
23:10;23:12;"Maybe Apple should buy Chipotle."
23:12;23:13;"Could happen."
23:13;23:14;"I'm into it."
26:27;26:30;"So Seinfeld, 2017, just keeps being brutal."
26:30;26:33;"We heard that Gord Downie died."
26:33;26:38;"He was the singer of the Canadian band The Tragically Hip,"
26:38;26:42;"and I think a lot of Americans last week saw a lot of Canadian people talking about it."
26:42;26:46;"They're an example of a classic band that's huge in their home country"
26:46;26:50;"and then had kind of limited or cult success in America."
26:50;26:53;"And kind of one of the first things that I saw about it"
26:53;26:58;"was the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, talking about Gord Downie."
26:58;27:02;"I don't know if Trudeau is specifically just such a fan of Gord Downie,"
27:02;27:07;"or if Gord Downie and The Tragically Hip were just such a major presence,"
27:07;27:09;"but I just didn't really have a gauge for it."
27:09;27:11;"I was aware of The Tragically Hip, they seemed cool,"
27:11;27:16;"but I couldn't tell, is this like in England when a beetle dies?"
27:16;27:19;"Of course the Prime Minister's going to talk about them."
27:19;27:24;"So it's very moving to see this head of state getting really emotional about an artist."
27:24;27:25;"Do you have the clip?"
27:25;27:26;"Yeah, yeah, here it is."
27:26;27:30;"We lost one of the very best of us this morning."
27:30;27:35;"Gord was my friend, but Gord was everyone's friend."
27:35;27:36;"It's who we were."
27:36;27:41;"Our buddy Gord, who loved this country with everything he had,"
27:41;27:46;"and not just loved it in a nebulous, ""Oh, I love Canada"" way."
27:46;27:53;"He loved every hidden corner, every story, every aspect of this country"
27:53;27:58;"that he celebrated his whole life."
27:58;28:00;"And he wanted to make it better."
28:00;28:05;"He knew as great as we were, we needed to be better than we are,"
28:05;28:11;"and that's why his last years were devoted to Cheney Wettjack and to reconciliation."
28:11;28:19;"This is something that I've certainly drawn inspiration and strength from,"
28:19;28:29;"and we are less as a country without Gord Downie in it."
28:29;28:35;"And we all knew it was coming, but we hoped it wasn't."
28:35;28:40;"And I thought I was going to make it through this, but I'm not."
28:40;28:41;"It hurts."
28:41;28:42;"Wow."
28:42;28:48;"Can you think of an American head of state being that emotional about anything?"
28:48;28:50;"Like cultural or anything."
28:50;28:56;"Wasn't there something like Obama shed some tears talking about the Newtown massacre?"
28:56;29:01;"Or the Charlotte massacre when he sang ""Amazing Grace."""
29:01;29:06;"Yeah, obviously that was like a show of emotion, but there's something about this that--"
29:06;29:08;"I mean, of course, these horrendous tragedies,"
29:08;29:15;"and I'm just trying to think of an American president talking about the loss of a great artist."
29:15;29:16;"Clearly he felt very connected."
29:16;29:18;"Yeah, imagine Trump weighing in on Petty."
29:18;29:20;"Yeah, I mean, in some ways Petty--"
29:20;29:22;"Or anyone."
29:22;29:27;"We have a lot of questions for you, because obviously we want to pay tribute to clearly such a person,"
29:27;29:30;"an important musician who meant so much to so many people."
29:30;29:34;"So Seinfeld, can you contextualize Gord Downie and Tragically Hip for us"
29:34;29:36;"who just don't know that much about him?"
29:36;29:39;"Yeah, I mean, I can try."
29:39;29:44;"Tragically Hip was a good example of maybe a band that reached the threshold"
29:44;29:49;"of how big you can get in Canada without breaking out beyond Canada."
29:49;29:52;"So there's this real sense of ownership, I think, in the country."
29:52;29:54;"Sloan."
29:54;29:57;"Yeah, oh, good one. Wow. Sloan. Do you guys--"
29:57;29:58;"I know Sloan."
29:58;30:00;"Yeah, Sloan's a great example."
30:00;30:04;"But yeah, they were sort of referred to as Canada's local band."
30:04;30:06;"That sort of is an indication."
30:06;30:09;"Yeah, because I was reading more about them. They sold a ton of records in Canada."
30:09;30:10;"What era are we talking here?"
30:10;30:13;"I think their peak would have been mid-'90s."
30:13;30:14;"Oh, like indie?"
30:14;30:15;"First album, '89."
30:15;30:16;"Okay."
30:16;30:17;"Yeah."
30:17;30:20;"Like post-Nirvana indie stuff?"
30:20;30:21;"Yeah, I wouldn't call them quite indie."
30:21;30:22;"It seemed a little rootsy."
30:22;30:26;"Rootsy, major label, but within Canada."
30:26;30:27;"D&B?"
30:27;30:30;"Alternative rock, I think, is what you would say."
30:30;30:33;"To me, as a kid--and this is probably wildly inaccurate--"
30:33;30:37;"but I always saw them as almost like the Canadian R.E.M. a little bit."
30:37;30:40;"And they sort of--visually, they kind of look like that as well."
30:40;30:44;"But yeah, I think what Justin was saying about Gord loving Canada"
30:44;30:46;"was very apparent throughout his career."
30:46;30:50;"And then near the end, it was known that he was dying."
30:50;30:52;"He had an incurable form of brain cancer."
30:52;30:53;"Oh, man."
30:53;30:55;"He revealed it end of 2015."
30:55;31:00;"So the last couple years of his life were devoted to indigenous issues in Canada"
31:00;31:02;"because there were a lot of really messed up things,"
31:02;31:06;"much like in the States, that happened with Native people in the country."
31:06;31:12;"So he was devoting a lot of time and his voice to bringing attention to their plight"
31:12;31:14;"and just a lot of the messed up stuff that happened there."
31:14;31:19;"But I mean, yeah, he was just--you know, him and his band were pretty iconic"
31:19;31:23;"and they had won every sort of award and every possible honor."
31:23;31:26;"But at the same time, they weren't like Nickelback or Avril Lavigne"
31:26;31:28;"or Barenaked Ladies where they were like--"
31:28;31:29;"Or Bryan Adams."
31:29;31:30;"Bryan Adams, yeah."
31:30;31:33;"So they occupied this really unique sort of space"
31:33;31:36;"where I think Canadians felt a real ownership over them."
31:36;31:40;"So they had huge hits in Canada that just didn't cross over."
31:40;31:41;"That's exactly right."
31:41;31:44;"Like you couldn't--they were sort of inescapable, especially in the '90s."
31:44;31:45;"Wow."
31:45;31:47;"Well, also, you know, one thing I've thought about a lot"
31:47;31:51;"is that Canada has always punched so far above its weight."
31:51;31:55;"As far as producing like global, like monster hits,"
31:55;32:01;"Canada, I think, is a more successful music nation than America per capita."
32:01;32:04;"I mean, what is it--the population of Canada is like 10% of America, right?"
32:04;32:05;"Yeah."
32:05;32:06;"And I always thought about this."
32:06;32:11;"In the '90s, they produced so many of the biggest albums."
32:11;32:14;"Alanis Morissette, that album was bananas huge."
32:14;32:15;"Yep."
32:15;32:18;"Shania Twain, huge."
32:18;32:20;"And Celine Dion."
32:20;32:21;"Celine Dion, yeah."
32:21;32:25;"I feel like three of the biggest global records made by women"
32:25;32:27;"were all Canadian women."
32:27;32:30;"Did they come to America, though, to do that?"
32:30;32:34;"Like kind of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell went to L.A. in the '60s to make their careers."
32:34;32:38;"Well, they all teamed up with American producers."
32:38;32:42;"So I guess my question for you, Seinfeld, is knowing that Canada is producing"
32:42;32:45;"all these international superstars, was that part of the charm"
32:45;32:47;"where they're like tragically hip, huge here,"
32:47;32:49;"but we know that they're not big elsewhere?"
32:49;32:52;"Or was it one of those things like sometimes you meet somebody from another country"
32:52;32:54;"and they're like, ""Have you heard of whatever?"""
32:54;32:56;"And you're like, ""No."" And they're like, ""You're kidding me."""
32:56;33:01;"I think it was a little bit like maybe it was kind of what is it about this band"
33:01;33:03;"that they're not really breaking out?"
33:03;33:06;"And maybe there was a sense that they weren't even really interested"
33:06;33:11;"in that kind of crossover success, and that made them a little bit cooler nationally."
33:11;33:12;"Right."
33:12;33:14;"They didn't move to New York or L.A."
33:14;33:16;"That's right. They didn't leave."
33:16;33:17;"Maybe there's so many Canadians."
33:17;33:18;"Where were they based out of?"
33:18;33:19;"Yeah, where are they from?"
33:19;33:21;"They came out of Kingston, and then they were like Kingston, Ontario."
33:21;33:26;"Queen's University is where they were founded, and then they were kind of Toronto-oriented."
33:26;33:27;"Wow."
33:27;33:32;"So what are some songs to help our non-Canadian listeners understand?"
33:32;33:36;"Well, I was saying their biggest hit was the song ""Ahead by a Century,"""
33:36;33:41;"which is like, again, was always on television for a couple years."
33:41;33:45;"But I like this song, my music at work."
33:45;33:48;"And then there was a later song called ""Poets"" that was cool, too,"
33:48;33:54;"that kind of like--the dude has kind of like this wry, lyrical sensibility, let's say."
33:54;33:56;"Let's start with the biggest hit."
33:56;33:57;"All right."
33:57;33:59;"So this is the Tragically Hips' biggest hit in Canada."
33:59;34:02;"This is from the late '90s. It's called ""Ahead by a Century."""
34:02;34:08;"[♪♪]"
34:08;34:09;"What year?"
34:09;34:11;"This was '96."

34:52;34:53;"This takes you back?"
34:53;34:54;"I'm feeling it."
34:54;34:56;"Yeah, it's very nostalgic."
34:56;34:58;"Was this one of their big hits or your personal pick?"
34:58;35:00;"No, this is their biggest hit."
35:00;35:01;"This is like the breakthrough."
35:01;35:02;"Wow."
35:02;35:03;"The chart-topper for them."

35:42;35:43;"What do you mean?"
35:43;35:45;"I think it's just his, like, intonation."
35:45;35:47;"It's almost like you can hear it in his accent."
35:47;35:51;"But also I'm just used to, like, this being on Canadian television, like, constantly,"
35:51;35:52;"like this video."
35:52;35:57;"And also, like, the video itself is, like, this sepia-toned, rural,"
35:57;36:01;"slightly depressive video that I just associate with that time."
36:01;36:02;"Wintry."

36:19;36:24;"No, it was just that American music from this time that sounded like this"
36:24;36:26;"would tend not to top the charts."

36:28;36:31;"I mean, I'm hearing some, like, Alice in Chains,"
36:31;36:33;"just not as, like, dissonant and minor."
36:33;36:37;"Like that later period Alice in Chains acoustic."
36:37;36:39;"Acoustic stuff? Oh, yeah, totally."
36:39;36:41;"It was definitely in that wave."
36:41;36:44;"And I'm hearing some Milanes, I'll be honest."
36:44;36:46;"It's not even a million miles away from pavement, though."
36:46;36:48;"No."

37:01;37:03;"So how old is Justin Trudeau?"
37:03;37:06;"Oh, man, he must be in his early 40s, I think."
37:06;37:08;"He's, like, my age, basically."
37:08;37:13;"So basically, if there was a 43-year-old guy that was president that was like,"
37:13;37:15;"""Steve Malcolm has died today."""
37:15;37:17;"He's 45."
37:17;37:23;"""And I gotta tell you, pavement was a titan of '90s indie rock,"
37:23;37:25;"a true American original."""
37:25;37:27;"Well, that makes you think about that--"
37:27;37:29;"See, that's a good question."
37:29;37:31;"You're saying that they were kind of like the Canadian R.E.M.,"
37:31;37:34;"but obviously there's this other layer that--"
37:34;37:36;"I guess it's also because Canada's a smaller country."
37:36;37:39;"Like, it'd be hard to think of--"
37:39;37:41;"I mean, there are American--"
37:41;37:44;"Even when Bob Dylan's going to die, and it's like--"
37:44;37:47;"whether it's Trump or someone else who's president,"
37:47;37:50;"they're not going to come out and, like, get choked up about it."
37:50;37:52;"It seemed really personal for Trudeau."
37:52;37:53;"Oh, God, can you imagine?"
37:53;37:54;"Which I love."
37:54;37:55;"I don't even want to picture Trump's--"
37:55;37:56;"Oh, it's so brutal."
37:56;37:58;"Yeah, maybe it is that Trudeau is just like--"
37:58;37:59;"Trump wouldn't say anything."
37:59;38:01;"Obama would have."
38:01;38:04;"If Dylan died three years ago, Obama would have said something, for sure."
38:04;38:06;"Or like Willie Nelson or--"
38:06;38:08;"Like you're saying, there's something about Gord Downie."
38:08;38:11;"Bob Dylan, also clearly an important American artist,"
38:11;38:16;"but this kind of elusive, kind of hard-to-pin-down dude."
38:16;38:19;"Trudeau's basically-- what he said, literally, was like--"
38:19;38:22;"he was like, ""Everybody in Canada felt like this dude was their friend."""
38:22;38:24;"So that was just the vibe that he gave off."
38:24;38:27;"He was just known to be kind of like a good dude, straightforward."
38:27;38:30;"You said he was fighting for indigenous rights."
38:30;38:33;"Yeah, who's the American version of that?"
38:33;38:35;"Bruce Springsteen?"
38:35;38:39;"But even Bruce Springsteen-- I guess maybe America is--"
38:39;38:42;"obviously-- well, maybe Canada's catching up,"
38:42;38:44;"but America's to the right of Canada politically,"
38:44;38:48;"so Bruce rankles some right-wingers."
38:48;38:51;"Just to give you a sense of his significance,"
38:51;38:56;"after his cancer was announced and then there was a final concert,"
38:56;38:58;"and that was broadcast on CBC, which is--"
38:58;39:00;"-Wow. -Which is like the--"
39:00;39:02;"-BBC? -PBS, or the BBC, sure."
39:02;39:07;"11.7 million people watched it in Canada, which is like--"
39:07;39:10;"What's the population of Canada, like 30 or 40 million?"
39:10;39:13;"That's a good question. I feel like it's like 25 or 30."
39:13;39:15;"It's 36 million."
39:15;39:17;"So a third of the population watched the show."
39:17;39:21;"-It's just crazy. -That's the equivalent of the Super Bowl in America."
39:21;39:25;"So I think Justin Trudeau is kind of acting as a bit of a conduit"
39:25;39:27;"for the whole country."
39:27;39:30;"It's like Michael Stipe has brain cancer."
39:30;39:32;"They're going to play a show."
39:32;39:35;"100 million people watched it in the U.S."
39:35;39:37;"Yeah."
39:37;39:39;"-It's like so crazy. -Yeah."
39:39;39:41;"That's so brutal."
39:41;39:44;"I guess one small thing you can say about Gord Downie and Tom Petty"
39:44;39:48;"is like for lifelong musicians, there is something cool about Gord Downie"
39:48;39:51;"getting to go play final shows with this knowledge."
39:51;39:55;"Obviously, I'm sure it was-- who can even imagine what that feels like?"
39:55;39:58;"But to get to go do final shows for the country you love."
39:58;40:01;"And then even Tom Petty, it was sudden,"
40:01;40:04;"but he died a week after wrapping up a tour"
40:04;40:07;"doing a few nights at the Hollywood Bowl."
40:07;40:10;"There's something nice about hearing somebody devoted their entire life"
40:10;40:14;"to a profession just to know that at least they got to go do it"
40:14;40:16;"-one last time or something. -Yeah."
40:16;40:19;"I wonder if Bob Marley played a last show."
40:19;40:21;"Because he died in his 30s of brain cancer."
40:21;40:24;"-Do you remember the documentary? -I don't."
40:24;40:27;"Part of the implication is that maybe he waited too long to treat it"
40:27;40:29;"-or it was just-- -Oh, that's right."
40:29;40:33;"Remember there's that footage of him in Germany or Switzerland or something"
40:33;40:37;"because he kind of towards the end traveled to get treatment."
40:37;40:41;"It's so brutal, this dude who clearly was at home in Kingston, Jamaica,"
40:41;40:45;"where he's from, and they were kind of describing him."
40:45;40:49;"So then suddenly he's in this cold, snowy place, lost all his hair."
40:49;40:52;"-Man. -So I don't think he--"
40:52;40:56;"-Didn't do a final show. -It looks like he found out"
40:56;41:00;"about his cancer right before his last show."
41:00;41:02;"-Like he was on tour. -Wow."
41:02;41:04;"He got the news. He was like, ""Okay, I'm going to play this show."""
41:04;41:06;"-And then that was-- -Okay, so he didn't know it was his last show."
41:06;41:08;"So maybe he knew, but he didn't announce it."

41:11;41:13;"Remember there's that thing Warren Zeevon knew he was dying"
41:13;41:16;"-and he made a final album. -Oh, right."
41:16;41:19;"That's a-- There's some great stuff on that record."
41:19;41:21;"-Yeah? Oh, I never actually listened to it. -Yeah, yeah."
41:21;41:24;"There's a song-- I think he was in that movie Funny People."
41:24;41:26;"-Oh, yeah? -That they use."
41:26;41:32;"There's a great song, and it's like him basically doing stuff around the house."
41:32;41:35;"-Yeah. -And aware of mortality."
41:35;41:37;"Oh, God, that's so heavy."
41:37;41:40;"-Bowie final-- -Oh, yeah, Bowie, after he died,"
41:40;41:43;"then it was kind of revealed that he was aware,"
41:43;41:46;"as he was finishing his album and filming his final videos,"
41:46;41:48;"he knew that he was dying."

43:17;43:19;"-Nick on the mic. -Sort of conversational."
43:19;43:25;"But when Seinfeld mentioned the PM, he said, ""Justin."""
43:25;43:29;"When Seinfeld was referencing the clip that we played of Trudeau speaking,"
43:29;43:33;"he said, you know, when Justin was talking about him."
43:33;43:35;"Yeah, so what's up with that, Seinfeld?"
43:35;43:38;"-First-name basis? -You know, I hadn't even thought about that."
43:38;43:40;"What's like if Bernie had won? We'd call him Bernie."
43:40;43:43;"Yeah, I think there's maybe a certain-- I mean--"
43:43;43:47;"Oh, that's true. And if Hillary had won, I think we'd still call her Hillary."
43:47;43:48;"-Yeah. -Yeah, because--"
43:48;43:50;"-It's just like, ""Trump."" -He's also--"
43:50;43:52;"-Hillary-- -He's a younger guy, too."
43:52;43:55;"So you kind of feel like, ""Oh, that's just Justin."""
43:55;43:57;"That's just--"
43:57;43:59;"""Justin."""
43:59;44:01;"-It's a good question. -Yeah, actually--"
44:01;44:05;"And also, Hillary and Bernie-- now that I think about it,"
44:05;44:09;"were they like the first two, like, big names in the world"
44:09;44:11;"that were the first two, like--"
44:11;44:13;"No, actually, there's a million examples. I like Ike and stuff."
44:13;44:15;"But in recent memory, I feel like--"
44:15;44:19;"-Like first name? -Yeah, 'cause Obama's Obama."
44:19;44:21;"Yeah, Bush."
44:21;44:23;"-Clinton. -Nader."
44:23;44:25;"It would have been funny if it was just Donald."
44:25;44:27;"Right, the Donald."
44:27;44:30;"-The Donald, yeah. -Yeah, because it was always that--"
44:30;44:32;"Hillary's stuff said Hillary."
44:32;44:37;"Well, and understandably, because there was another famous Clinton president, so--"
44:37;44:40;"But Hillary, Bernie, Trump."
44:40;44:45;"I feel like I just instinctively did it, so I think, yeah."
44:45;44:48;"-I think Prime Minister Trudeau-- -Who was the PM?"
44:48;44:50;"-And also, his father was Prime Minister Trudeau, right? -That's right, yeah."
44:50;44:53;"Ah, so maybe that's part of it, too."
44:53;44:57;"""Please, Prime Minister Trudeau is my father. I'm Prime Minister Justin."""
44:57;45:00;"-I go by Justin. -'Cause it was Stephen Harper before him,"
45:00;45:02;"but you would have never said ""Steven."""
45:02;45:04;"-Stevie. -Steve."
45:04;45:08;"It's also just certain names lend themselves to that more than others."
45:08;45:12;"""Steven."" Yeah, ""Steven"" is not-- You don't want to be like, ""Justin."""
45:12;45:15;"I don't know, why is Justin a more chill name than ""Steven""?"
45:15;45:17;"Jerry Brown and Pat Brown."
45:17;45:19;"But Jerry doesn't go by Jerry."
45:19;45:21;"That'd be cool if Jerry Brown went by Jerry."
45:21;45:24;"-You can, there's only one Jerry. -Jerry!"
45:24;45:27;"Yeah, there's only one Jerry out of California."
45:27;45:30;"-Jerry. -Jerry!"
45:30;45:33;"I wonder if Jerry Brown and Jerry Garcia ever hung out. I bet they did."
45:33;45:35;"-Oh, yeah. -70s."
45:35;45:37;"-They must have met. -Yeah."
45:37;45:40;"When Jerry Brown was dating Linda Ronstadt."
45:40;45:43;"Definitely Don Henley and Jerry Brown hung out."
45:43;45:45;"Oh, man. Okay."
45:45;45:49;"So Seinfeld, one last song. So we listened to Tragically Hip's biggest hit,"
45:49;45:52;"and this is more of a personal one, ""My Music at Work,"" that you just like."
45:52;45:56;"Yeah, I mean, I just think it's just a little bit more upbeat."
45:56;45:58;"Maybe it's a little less adult contemporary."
45:58;46:01;"-Did you ever see him in concert? -No."
46:01;46:04;"I never did. And on that note--"
46:04;46:07;"You're lukewarm as a fan. You're representing the nation."
46:07;46:11;"Well, you know, as I was kind of saying earlier, like, it wasn't really--"
46:11;46:15;"You know, like, in the '90s, you kind of picked your genre,"
46:15;46:18;"and you kind of, you know, we were listening to like Wu-Tang and stuff."
46:18;46:20;"-You were a hip-hop guy. -Copy that."
46:20;46:23;"I was a hip-hop guy. I remember my friend bought Melissa Etheridge's--"
46:23;46:26;"-What was it, Dirty Little Secrets? -♪ Come through my window ♪"
46:26;46:29;"And we made fun of him mercilessly."
46:29;46:33;"It was like, ""How dare you outstep--?"" You know, like, Method Man's cool."
46:33;46:37;"-Melissa Etheridge isn't hip-hop. -Exactly. That's not rap."
46:37;46:41;"Oh, fair enough. And also, I feel like sometimes these bands, these like just--"
46:41;46:44;"It's even like we were talking about on the last show with Tom Petty."
46:44;46:47;"These huge, huge artists who kind of just define something."
46:47;46:52;"It's like you almost don't really need to like have an opinion on them because--"
46:52;46:54;"-Yeah. -Well, especially when you're a teenager."
46:54;46:58;"Like, no teenage kid was going to be like define themselves as a Petty fan."
46:58;47:00;"-But they probably liked it, you know? -Sure."
47:00;47:04;"And I guess maybe in the same way in Canada, it's like you were trying to define yourself"
47:04;47:08;"-as someone who loves Seinfeld and Wu-Tang. -That's right."
47:08;47:11;"It wouldn't have given you a specific identity if you were just like a huge,"
47:11;47:16;"tragically hip fan and watched-- What was the Seinfeld of Canada?"
47:16;47:19;"-Oh, boy. Ready or Not? -Yeah."
47:19;47:21;"-Do you remember that show? Degrassi? -Oh, we all know Degrassi."
47:21;47:24;"I like Ready or Not, though, because Americans always talk about Degrassi."
47:24;47:28;"There's like some kid at school just being like, ""Oh, I went to see Tragically Hip,"
47:28;47:32;"and then we came home and watched Ready or Not, and you're just like, 'Oh, yeah?'"""
47:32;47:35;"I was listening to Wu-Tang and watching Seinfeld."
47:35;47:38;"-Oh, yeah? -Oh, yeah?"
47:38;47:42;"Oh, yeah, Seinfeld? What's that? Something from the States?"
47:42;47:45;"That was a terrible accent."
47:45;47:48;"-Yeah, go to Channel 12. -Yeah."
47:48;47:52;"You were like-- I like things from the States."
47:52;47:57;"Things like Seinfeld. I'm going Irish. Full Irish."
47:57;48:01;"I like things from the States. I like Seinfeld, Wu-Tang."
48:01;48:04;"I don't like the cranberries, ma."
48:04;48:07;"-I like Seinfeld. I like Jerry. -I don't like Sloane."
48:07;48:09;"Now it is becoming an Irish thing."
48:09;48:12;"I don't like you, too. I don't like the cranberries."
48:12;48:15;"You take your Alanis. Put it on a shelf."
48:15;48:19;"I like Seinfeld. You God. RZA."
48:19;48:23;"-I like the Eagles. -I like--"
48:23;48:26;"I don't like mainstream Irish culture, ma."
48:26;48:30;"-I like American things. -Why is it RZA?"
48:30;48:35;"This crew is not strong-suited towards accents."
48:35;48:39;"I feel like there's-- Is there any? I feel like I'm good at some."
48:39;48:42;"I don't like--"
48:42;48:45;"Never thought of the Irish RZA connection in terms of accent."
48:45;48:49;"-Ma. -It's also really funny to be somebody from one country"
48:49;48:52;"and be like, ""I'm not into the mainstream culture of this country."
48:52;48:55;"I'm into the mainstream culture of another country."""
48:55;48:58;"There are those guys that are always the Brit Rock people."
48:58;49:00;"-Oh, yeah. Right. -Fetishizing."
49:00;49:02;"-Who are into Ride and Pulp. -Right."
49:02;49:06;"-You're just like, ""Okay, dude."" -Sorry I don't like Nirvana."
49:06;49:09;"-I like Blur. -Blur."
49:09;49:13;"Pulp. Ride. Oasis."
49:13;49:16;"-That's my scene. -It'd be really hilarious to just be"
49:16;49:20;"virulently anti-Nirvana but then be into Oasis."
49:20;49:24;"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not just your typical kid who listens to rock radio"
49:24;49:28;"and is just obsessed with Nirvana. I like Oasis."
49:28;49:32;"-In their home country. -I totally knew kids like that in college."
49:32;49:34;"The Brit pop posters in their room."
49:34;49:37;"-I like Oasis. There's nothing wrong with it. -No, sure."
49:37;49:40;"It's just that hilarious thing because back home in the UK,"
49:40;49:44;"Oasis literally played bigger concerts than Nirvana ever did."
49:44;49:47;"-Oh, yeah. -And then if you're a kid in the UK"
49:47;49:50;"and probably all your friends were into Oasis and you really felt some need"
49:50;49:52;"to prove that you weren't like them, you'd be like--"
49:52;49:54;"-I'm into Soundgarden. -Yeah."
49:54;49:57;"And Alice in Chains. I'm not into Oasis."
49:57;49:59;"I'm a Soundgarden guy."
49:59;50:03;"Oasis is just for regular-ass dips--"
50:03;50:06;"I'm a Teenage Fan Club fan."
50:06;50:09;"Scottish music. Not English."
50:09;50:12;"-Scott rock. -Scott--"
50:12;50:15;"-We're deep. -There's a lot of good music from Scotland."
50:15;50:17;"-We should do a show about it. -Oh, yeah."
50:17;50:19;"-Okay, so anyway-- -TFC, Belle and Sebastian."
50:19;50:21;"-Ed Sheeran. -Yeah, I was thinking about it recently."
50:21;50:23;"-Ed Sheeran's not Scottish. -Oh, yeah."
50:23;50:26;"-My bad. -Disrespectful."
50:26;50:29;"I was listening to some Belle and Sebastian recently"
50:29;50:32;"and I was like, ""You know what? Belle and Sebastian,"
50:32;50:34;"I've seen a few people hate on them in the past five years."""
50:34;50:36;"-Really? -And I was like, ""You know what?"
50:36;50:39;"-Get the f--- out of here."" -The band's tight."
50:39;50:41;"First few albums, I was so deep."
50:41;50:44;"Okay, so one last more personal pick from Seinfeld"

53:34;53:38;"That was a pick from Proud Canadian, Seinfeld 2000."
53:38;53:39;"Thanks for educating us."
53:39;53:42;"I mean, truly, I'd like to learn more about Tragically Hip."
53:42;53:46;"Gord Downie really seems like he was a good dude."
53:46;53:48;"And rest in peace."
53:48;53:51;"And shout out to all the fans of ""The Tragically Hip."""
53:51;53:54;"And shout out to Justin as well."

53:56;53:59;"But I do appreciate a head of state"
53:59;54:03;"being emotional and personal about art."
54:03;54:05;"So Jake, you've been talking to me for a while"
54:05;54:07;"about a Neil Young song"
54:07;54:09;"that you wanted to play on the program."
54:09;54:10;"- Right."
54:10;54:14;"- This is from his album called ""The Monsanto Years."""
54:14;54:15;"- Right."
54:15;54:16;"Well, okay, a few things."
54:16;54:19;"I mean, one, I think two episodes ago"
54:19;54:22;"we talked about Madison Rising."
54:22;54:23;"- Oh, the core--"
54:23;54:26;"- The so-called America's most patriotic rock band."
54:26;54:27;"- Self-proclaimed. - Yeah."
54:27;54:29;"- And then we were talking about, like,"
54:29;54:32;"well, they were, like, in the most literal way"
54:32;54:34;"just, like, hitting all of the, like, bullet points"
54:34;54:36;"of, like, right-wing talking points."
54:36;54:37;"- Right."
54:37;54:39;"- Like, we listened to that song called ""Right to Bear."""
54:39;54:40;"- 'Cause they're pro-gun."
54:40;54:42;"- And they're, like, deeply pro-gun."

54:45;54:48;"♪ To protect my home when I need it ♪"

54:55;54:59;"address a topic that they're passionate about?"
54:59;55:01;"- Right, 'cause even the Bruce Springsteen's of the world,"
55:01;55:04;"there's too much, like, poetry and storytelling."
55:04;55:06;"- Yeah, it's, like, more obscured."
55:06;55:07;"It's, like, metaphorical."
55:07;55:09;"- The left-wing version of, like, Madison Rising"

55:18;55:19;"- But-- - Straight up."
55:19;55:21;"- So Neil Young, late in his career,"
55:21;55:23;"he's just, like, ""I don't care."
55:23;55:24;"Like, I'm not trying to be hip."
55:24;55:27;"I've written hundreds of amazing"
55:27;55:30;"poetic and metaphorical songs."
55:30;55:33;"None of the young cats out there are writing"
55:33;55:35;"directly political protest songs."""
55:35;55:36;"- Right."
55:36;55:39;"- So during the Bush years, he put out that record"
55:39;55:43;"with, like, ♪ Let's impeach the president ♪"
55:43;55:45;"'Cause he was, like, ""No one else is doing this."""
55:45;55:46;"- Right. - And then later,"
55:46;55:49;"in, like, 2015 or 2014,"
55:49;55:51;"he put out the Monsanto Years,"
55:51;55:54;"which was a concept album about Monsanto"
55:54;55:56;"ruining the world and agriculture."
55:56;55:58;"And there's one specific song that really ties"
55:58;56:01;"into ""Time Crisis"" 'cause it's about retail"
56:01;56:03;"and agriculture."
56:03;56:04;"- It's super straightforward."
56:04;56:07;"- And just the most straightforward..."
56:07;56:08;"- Good for him. No, he-- - Protest music."
56:08;56:09;"- You're totally right."
56:09;56:11;"It's, like, the young cats,"
56:11;56:14;"everybody wants to be on the right side,"
56:14;56:16;"whatever they consider to be these days."
56:16;56:17;"But, you know, as an artist and you're young,"
56:17;56:19;"you still, first and foremost,"
56:19;56:20;"you want to make sure that, like,"
56:20;56:22;"you're, like, subtle and cool."
56:22;56:23;"- Yeah."
56:23;56:26;"- 'Cause it's not very cool to be super straightforward."
56:26;56:27;"- Mm-mm."
56:27;56:29;"- Rap lends itself a little bit more"
56:29;56:30;"to straightforward things."
56:30;56:31;"Like, when you think about, like,"
56:31;56:33;"some of the more certain political songs"

01:15:33;01:15:35;"But still, there's something about the music"
