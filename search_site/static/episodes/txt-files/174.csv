00:02;00:05;"Rock and roll"
00:05;00:07;"Hip-hop"
00:07;00:08;"cheese crackers"
00:08;00:10;"Hall of Fame"
00:10;00:12;"Hall of Fame"
00:12;00:14;"So much to talk about so little time"
00:14;00:17;"But if you're listening you're in"
00:17;00:21;"Welcome to time crisis"
00:21;00:23;"This one is a doozy"
00:23;00:27;"crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:27;00:29;"Take it!"
00:34;00:36;"They passed me by"
00:36;00:40;"All of those great romances"
00:40;00:42;"They were a threat"
00:42;00:47;"Robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:49;"My picture clear"
00:49;00:54;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:54;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow"
00:58;01:01;"When a bus had to go"
01:01;01:03;"Now it's different"
01:03;01:06;"I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"He's the lonely man"
01:16;01:19;"Welcome to time crisis. We got a fully loaded F"
01:19;01:22;"Lots to talk about today. Jake, how you doing?"
01:22;01:26;"Good man. We got bacon and sour cream on the side. We're ready to go"
01:26;01:29;"Jake, when's the last time you had a baked potato?"
01:29;01:33;"That's a good one. Years. In some sort of buffet situation"
01:33;01:37;"Where it looked good for"
01:37;01:40;"Maybe options were thin and I was like oh yeah"
01:40;01:43;"Baked potato and just loaded up with green onions"
01:43;01:46;"Cheddar cheese, bacon, sour cream"
01:46;01:48;"Sour cream. Absolutely. Go off."
01:48;01:52;"Because the baked potato is so dry you need the sour cream to"
01:52;01:56;"kind of mash it into the baked potato so it kind of softens up"
01:56;01:59;"Yeah, it's got to be really buttery. Yeah. I feel like in the 90s"
01:59;02:02;"I was eating all sorts of baked potatoes"
02:02;02:05;"Yeah, it does seem like a very 20th century food, right?"
02:05;02:08;"They really left it in the 20th century. Yeah, I feel like in the 90s"
02:08;02:11;"I mean, was I eating that at home?"
02:11;02:14;"I can kind of picture going to a restaurant and being like"
02:14;02:17;"Oh man, they got baked potatoes. Yeah"
02:17;02:20;"I'm getting a fully loaded. Is fully loaded baked potato"
02:20;02:23;"Like from somewhere? Is that a side note?"
02:23;02:26;"Good question. Is that just a concept or is that the"
02:26;02:29;"Proprietary intellectual property of"
02:29;02:32;"Of a Fudruckers? When you google fully loaded"
02:32;02:35;"Baked potato, first of all, autocomplete like activates"
02:35;02:38;"As soon as you hit the B. So and then"
02:38;02:41;"I think just the calling it a fully loaded baked potato is"
02:41;02:44;"Part of the baked potato culture. I don't think any one person"
02:44;02:47;"Owns it. Campbell's Food Service has a product"
02:47;02:50;"Called Campbell's Reserve Frozen Ready to Eat"
02:50;02:53;"Fully Loaded Baked Potato and Cheddar Soup. Okay"
02:53;02:56;"Sounds caloric. This might be a dumb question but"
02:56;02:59;"Does the phrase fully loaded come from anything"
02:59;03:02;"In particular? Or is fully loaded just a phrase"
03:02;03:05;"That refers to any object that has"
03:05;03:08;"All the accoutrement? All the trappings"
03:08;03:11;"Great question man. This is just"
03:11;03:14;"Like an English language college course here"
03:14;03:17;"Fully loaded. I always think of Herbie"
03:17;03:20;"Fully Loaded the classic film"
03:20;03:23;"I think it's a sequel. Yeah, cars are fully loaded"
03:23;03:26;"I mean actually I would love to do a family feud"
03:26;03:29;"Type thing. These things are"
03:29;03:32;"Commonly fully loaded"
03:32;03:35;"Baked potatoes. What would be the"
03:35;03:38;"Top five fully loaded things on family feud?"
03:38;03:41;"Baked potatoes, cars. Under loaded in Merriam-Webster"
03:41;03:44;"The fully loaded refers to"
03:44;03:47;"A car equipped with an abundance of features"
03:47;03:50;"I.e. a fully loaded car filled or topped with many things"
03:50;03:53;"A fully loaded baked potato"
03:53;03:56;"Those are the two examples. Those are the lead examples"
03:56;03:59;"Also can you refer to somebody who's like really drunk"
03:59;04:02;"As fully loaded? Oh bro he was so loaded"
04:02;04:05;"He was fully loaded. I mean it doesn't"
04:05;04:08;"But I think to be fully loaded I would picture somebody who is on drugs"
04:08;04:11;"Shrooms. I feel like it has to be a variety of things"
04:11;04:14;"And obviously people have been loading wagons"
04:14;04:17;"Forever but this idea that fully loaded"
04:17;04:20;"Doesn't just mean full it means"
04:20;04:23;"That it has a variety of things"
04:23;04:26;"You know what I mean? Like because Seinfeld if you and I were"
04:26;04:29;"Loading a wagon on the farm I could say"
04:29;04:32;"Is the wagon fully loaded? And you might say yes"
04:32;04:35;"We put all of the hay on the wagon"
04:35;04:38;"And we're just talking about one thing. You wouldn't say"
04:38;04:41;"Man the wagon is fully loaded. Man we got hay"
04:41;04:44;"I threw a few bricks in there. I took two chickens"
04:44;04:47;"So where does this idea that fully loaded means"
04:47;04:50;"A variety of categories of things are present"
04:50;04:53;"If it was just bales of hay you'd say we have a full load"
04:53;04:56;"Yeah. Yeah. It seems like"
04:56;04:59;"The fully loaded. The wagon's loaded"
04:59;05:02;"It implies that those things are somehow built into the other thing"
05:02;05:05;"If that makes sense. That they are"
05:05;05:08;"Draw that out. Alright yeah. Okay"
05:08;05:11;"I'm trying to find it here but essentially if you're putting hay on a wagon"
05:11;05:14;"You say it's fully loaded. The vibe is a little bit"
05:14;05:17;"Different from that wagon. It's fully loaded in that it has"
05:17;05:20;"A stereo system installed in it and it has an AC"
05:20;05:23;"Thing and the loading becomes a permanent part"
05:23;05:26;"Of the structure. But that's not true with the baked potato"
05:26;05:29;"Well Jake started off by talking about mashing the"
05:29;05:32;"Sour cream in there. I feel like. Basically it only applies"
05:32;05:35;"To baked potatoes and carbs. We kind of"
05:35;05:38;"Nailed it. First thought best thought"
05:38;05:41;"According to Urban Dictionary"
05:41;05:44;"Professional hair styling, skin treatment and done up makeup"
05:44;05:47;"That has stark contrast to the wash and wear hair and fresh face"
05:47;05:50;"Look can be described as fully loaded"
05:50;05:53;"For example did you see that celebrity's morning face"
05:53;05:56;"No. She's always fully loaded"
05:56;05:59;"Fully loaded. I mean that kind of makes sense"
05:59;06:02;"Got the makeup, got the mascara"
06:02;06:05;"The cover up, got the hair all that stuff"
06:05;06:08;"I just wonder when this started. Is it a phrase"
06:08;06:11;"Does it come from like the 50's like the post war era"
06:11;06:14;"We might have to do a bit more research but"
06:14;06:17;"I just wonder also was it used first for baked potatoes or carbs"
06:17;06:20;"Is it possible that like in some part of Wisconsin"
06:20;06:23;"They referred to fully loaded baked potatoes"
06:23;06:26;"Starting in the 20's and then"
06:26;06:29;"The post war boom in the 50's people start opening up"
06:29;06:32;"Car dealerships, people come in then you have the introduction"
06:32;06:35;"Of this new American archetype, the slick car salesman"
06:35;06:38;"Saying Bob"
06:38;06:41;"I'm not pulling your leg here, this is one of the best cars"
06:41;06:44;"I've ever seen and it would be a damn shame if you didn't"
06:44;06:47;"Get it fully loaded and then the guy's like oh like a baked potato"
06:47;06:50;"He's like of course. See I think it's the opposite"
06:50;06:53;"I think it started with the car and then because"
06:53;06:56;"You know in the 19's, let's think about the depression"
06:56;06:59;"There wasn't the abundance to put sour cream"
06:59;07:02;"And bacon and cheddar cheese and onions"
07:02;07:05;"On your baked potato. I'm picturing a baked potato in 1930"
07:05;07:08;"And it's a pretty Spartan meal"
07:08;07:11;"Fully unloaded"
07:11;07:14;"Very dry, bland, just a lot of butter"
07:14;07:17;"Lucky to get butter maybe. Butter and salt"
07:17;07:20;"And then you know the car dealership"
07:20;07:23;"Plus the restaurant from the car dealership is the family restaurant"
07:23;07:26;"And here we are in the age of abundance and they're fully loading"
07:26;07:29;"The baked potato. Making it just a massive"
07:29;07:32;"Caloric intake"
07:32;07:35;"Bread so old that it's moldy"
07:35;07:38;"Baked potato pockets they ain't loaded"
07:38;07:41;"I'm talking bout it, it can't fold"
07:41;07:44;"I throw the paper up, I can't hold it"
07:44;07:47;"Bread so old that it's moldy"
07:47;07:50;"Baked potato pockets they ain't loaded"
07:50;07:53;"I'm talking bout it, it can't fold"
07:53;07:56;"I throw the paper up, I can't hold it"
07:56;07:59;"What you know about a million dollar plate"
07:59;08:02;"I'm on the hallway look like a maze"
08:02;08:05;"I got to the money then got all my n****s paid"
08:05;08:08;"I'm too busy throwing dollars to be out here throwing shade"
08:08;08:11;"With the Rolls Royce like that b**** up out shipping"
08:11;08:14;"If you ain't talking paper then ain't nothing you can tell me"
08:14;08:17;"White chick brand new, no belly"
08:17;08:20;"N***a name Becky claims she don't give Becky"
08:20;08:23;"Well b**** get to stepping, I ain't with the gang"
08:23;08:26;"Cut from a different cloth, we are not the same"
08:26;08:29;"Them n****s gap in disregard what they saying"
08:29;08:32;"I can go and buy a house and get you bodied with the change"
08:32;08:35;"The more I think about it, it's very strange that it's only cars and baked potatoes"
08:35;08:38;"Because there's so many other things"
08:38;08:41;"Nobody ever talks about a fully loaded pizza"
08:41;08:44;"And that's like the number one thing, or a fully loaded burger"
08:44;08:47;"Does that exist anywhere?"
08:47;08:50;"People say the works, right?"
08:50;08:53;"Yeah, burger with the works, pizza with the works"
08:53;08:56;"We might not get to the bottom of this one today"
08:56;08:59;"A fully loaded pizza seems crazy though"
08:59;09:02;"Well you know, every..."
09:02;09:05;"No, but do you understand there's only so much you'd put on a baked potato"
09:05;09:08;"There's only so much you'd do to a car, a pizza that's fully loaded"
09:08;09:11;"Yeah, they're gross"
09:11;09:14;"But it could be everything"
09:14;09:17;"Yeah, pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, olives"
09:17;09:20;"Pineapple"
09:20;09:23;"They could have 10 possible toppings"
09:23;09:26;"And they'd probably get somebody ordering all 10"
09:26;09:29;"On one pizza, once a year at best"
09:29;09:32;"Yeah"
09:32;09:35;"Like somebody who actually calls them, let me get a pizza with pepperoni, olives, onions"
09:35;09:38;"I mean, I don't know, actually maybe not"
09:38;09:41;"Maybe it happens"
09:41;09:44;"It does sound like some epic meal time"
09:44;09:47;"Do you remember that YouTube channel where they would fry everything in bacon"
09:47;09:50;"It feels like something they would call one of their concoctions"
09:50;09:53;"Fully loaded pizza"
09:53;09:56;"That was America's peak, mid 90's"
09:56;09:59;"Somebody just driving their new fully loaded truck"
09:59;10:02;"With a CD player and a cassette player"
10:02;10:05;"What are the other fixings you get when you really ball out a car"
10:05;10:08;"Leather interior"
10:08;10:11;"Rolling into Kenny Rogers' roasters and getting that fully loaded baked potato"
10:11;10:14;"Getting a fully loaded baked potato"
10:14;10:17;"Eating it in your fully loaded truck"
10:17;10:20;"Just sitting there in your truck, all leather interior"
10:20;10:23;"Listening to a cassette or a CD, whichever you want to because you can do both"
10:23;10:26;"AC cranked and eating that fully loaded baked potato"
10:26;10:29;"With everything on it"
10:29;10:32;"And just feeling like you're living a fully loaded life"
10:32;10:35;"What are you listening to?"
10:35;10:38;"You're listening to Knocked Out Loaded by Bob Dylan"
10:38;10:41;"Isn't there like an alt rock record from the 90's called Loaded?"
10:41;10:44;"Yeah, Metallica"
10:44;10:47;"Is that late 90's? Metallica Loaded?"
10:47;10:50;"Dude, you're listening to Metallica Loaded"
10:50;10:53;"No, no, no, sorry. The Velvet Underground have an album called Loaded"
10:53;10:56;"And then Metallica made Load"
10:56;10:59;"Which famously the cover"
10:59;11:02;"Is an artist who worked in the form of"
11:02;11:05;"Male Ejaculate and Blood"
11:05;11:08;"Really? Here we are back on the Pearl Jam theme"
11:08;11:11;"Blake Shelton"
11:11;11:14;"I don't know why the universe is taking us back to that topic so often"
11:14;11:17;"Yeah, let's drop it. What would you say about Blake Shelton?"
11:17;11:20;"Oh yeah, he has a 2019 album called"
11:20;11:23;"Fully Loaded God's Country"
11:23;11:26;"Fully Loaded God's Country?"
11:26;11:29;"That's a mouthful"
11:29;11:32;"Yeah, it's a 2019 compilation album featuring the title track"
11:32;11:35;"God's Country"
11:35;11:38;"I feel like we heard it in the top 5 once"
11:38;11:41;"It does feel like a top 5 jam"
11:41;11:44;"Blake Shelton, let's throw that on"
11:44;11:47;"I know we probably have some listeners"
11:47;11:50;"It's been a hard few years"
11:50;11:53;"Maybe there's people who want to open their life to more abundance"
11:53;11:56;"Your life is in some ways"
11:56;11:59;"Not been everything you wanted it to be"
11:59;12:02;"You've had troubles, we all have"
12:02;12:05;"You've been in a car with nothing special about it"
12:05;12:08;"I want you to listen to this song"
12:08;12:11;"And imagine that you're sitting in a fully loaded car with a fully loaded baked potato"
12:11;12:14;"In front of you"
12:14;12:17;"And this is the abundance mindset that you need to take into the rest of this year"
12:17;12:20;"Your life is fully loaded"
12:20;12:23;"And good things are going to come to you"
12:23;12:26;"20th century empire mindset"
12:26;12:29;"Fully loaded is a state of mind"
12:29;12:32;"Right outside of this one church town"
12:32;12:35;"There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothing"
12:35;12:38;"Got a D to the land but it ain't my crown"
12:38;12:41;"This is God's Country"
12:41;12:44;"We have heard this song"
12:44;12:47;"We pray for rain and thank God"
12:47;12:50;"We're falling 'cause it brings a good time"
12:50;12:53;"And we're falling 'cause it brings a good time"
19:14;19:17;"All it glitters is gold"
19:17;19:23;"And she's buying the stairway to heaven"
19:23;19:27;"When she gets there she knows"
19:27;19:30;"If the stores are all closed"
19:30;19:37;"With a word she can get what she came for"
19:37;19:44;"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
19:44;19:49;"And she's buying the stairway to heaven"
19:49;19:54;"I don't know if it's junk science as just maybe sort of bad marketing."
19:54;19:58;"Maybe they just don't, they didn't know what the tribe called quest song,"
19:58;20:02;"and maybe it wasn't sort of, it didn't resonate culturally the way saying stairway to heaven is,"
20:02;20:05;"so they just sort of said, ""Hey, we aged it on hip-hop."""
20:05;20:07;"Just to get, you know, just to get buzz."
20:07;20:10;"Well, it's bad marketing and bad science."
20:10;20:12;"I want to try these cheeses. I mean, you know."
20:12;20:13;"I want to try these too."
20:13;20:15;"Maybe it's actually great marketing."
20:15;20:16;"We're talking about it."
20:16;20:19;"I got to say, I got to say science fans, stay away."
20:19;20:22;"Science fans, I cannot in good faith recommend this product."
20:22;20:26;"Every episode of this show, we talk about a product that actually does not exist."
20:26;20:28;"This does fully not exist."
20:28;20:29;"It's not available."
20:29;20:34;"Truly, when you think about this ecosystem and how it works,"
20:34;20:37;"these kind of like kooky ideas,"
20:37;20:39;"nobody actually gives a sh*t,"
20:39;20:41;"but it gets people like talking about a product."
20:41;20:45;"Nobody really particularly wants to try it outside a few freaks and us."
20:45;20:46;"Yeah."
20:46;20:49;"You realize losers, the entire losers like us."
20:49;20:50;"Absolutely."
20:50;20:54;"You could basically hire like one person just to like, you know,"
20:54;20:55;"a Nathan for you type character,"
20:55;20:59;"just to write three or four press releases like this every day."
20:59;21:03;"And they could work for like a thousand companies and just be like,"
21:03;21:07;"""Fruit by the Foot is concerned about the rain forest vanishing."
21:07;21:13;"That's why we're making a special green Amazonian toad Fruit by the Foot."
21:13;21:18;"It's the same toad that if you lick it, you get, you have a psychedelic trip."
21:18;21:19;"Ha ha, this one's not psychedelic,"
21:19;21:23;"but the packaging is done by noted psychedelic artist, Alex Gray."""
21:23;21:25;"You can just like make it up."
21:25;21:28;"They put out a press release, one picture."
21:28;21:30;"You need a graphic design person too."
21:30;21:32;"It would go like minorly viral."
21:32;21:34;"A few people would make fun of it."
21:34;21:37;"People would be like, ""Oh, why are you co-opting psychedelic culture?"""
21:37;21:40;"Some people would be like, ""Well, that's cool that at least they're bringing"
21:40;21:42;"awareness to the Amazon or some sh*t."""
21:42;21:46;"It would go away the next day and nobody would ever look for the products."
21:46;21:47;"It just wouldn't matter."
21:47;21:48;"Yeah."
21:48;21:50;"I'm really curious to see these Sway interviews too."
21:50;21:56;"Just like, because the thing is Sway is an iconic hip hop personality."
21:56;21:58;"He's done some very famous interviews."
21:58;22:03;"In fact, his name is a part of an iconic phrase."
22:03;22:05;"""You don't have the answers Sway."""
22:05;22:08;"Which comes from his legendary interview with Kanye."
22:08;22:11;"When would that have been? Six, seven years ago?"
22:11;22:13;"""You don't have the answers Sway."""
22:13;22:17;"I'm also curious about when this came through,"
22:17;22:20;"somebody's just saying to him, ""Okay, Sway."
22:20;22:26;"There was this study in Switzerland where they played different types of music"
22:26;22:27;"while they were aging the cheese."""
22:27;22:28;"He's like, ""Okay."""
22:28;22:33;"They're like, ""Yes, they played Stairway to Heaven, some Mozart,"
22:33;22:36;"Tribe Called Quest had kind of a stronger fruitier taste."""
22:36;22:37;"""Okay."""
22:37;22:38;"""Yeah."""
22:38;22:41;"Then anyway, you know, ""Cheezus was really inspired by this."""
22:41;22:42;"He's like, ""All right."""
22:42;22:44;"They're like, ""Anyway, long and short of it."""
22:44;22:45;"""We'll pay you to..."""
22:45;22:52;"""Cheezus wants to give you $25,000 to sit down with some of the members of Brand Newbian."""
22:52;22:54;"Are those on YouTube now?"
22:54;22:55;"Let's do it."
22:55;22:57;"I'm curious how many views they have."
22:57;22:59;"Oh, yeah. Seinfeld, can we check that out?"
22:59;23:01;"Just like, who's watching that?"
23:01;23:05;"Look, at the same time, you know, we look at the stuff with a critical eye,"
23:05;23:09;"but if I worked at Cheezus, if all of us worked at Cheezus,"
23:09;23:12;"we literally would just be spend all day looking up like cheese news."
23:12;23:14;"And one day one of us would be like,"
23:14;23:17;"""Hey guys, you read about this study in Switzerland?"""
23:17;23:19;"We're like, ""What the f***? We're reading about it?"
23:19;23:20;"It sounds like a joke."""
23:20;23:21;"And we're like, ""Anything we could do with it?"""
23:21;23:23;"And we're like, ""It could be a fun opportunity."""
23:23;23:25;"Yeah, no. Respect."
23:25;23:26;"Hip-hop content."
23:26;23:31;"Yeah, if you're working for Nabisco or whatever, it's like pretty dry."
23:31;23:35;"Could you imagine if everyone at Cheezus is just on their computer"
23:35;23:37;"looking up cheese news all day long?"
23:37;23:39;"Yeah, they're just sort of like, ""How do we shake this up?"""
23:39;23:42;"Man, I've been re-watching Mad Men."
23:42;23:43;"Whoa."
23:43;23:44;"Incredible program."
23:44;23:48;"I love like all of the other plots about like Don's affairs or whatever."
23:48;23:50;"I'm just sort of like not interested in it."
23:50;23:54;"I'm just like, give me the stuff of them pitching to clients."
23:54;23:56;"That's the best stuff on Mad Men."
23:56;23:59;"And it's just sort of like the most banal stuff"
23:59;24:03;"of just sort of like, yeah, just like moisturizer,"
24:03;24:06;"like a ham company."
24:06;24:08;"The last episode I watched,"
24:08;24:12;"and like Peggy tried to pull some stunt"
24:12;24:15;"with like the ham company and it didn't go well."
24:15;24:19;"And the executive of this ham, this baked ham company"
24:19;24:21;"was like irate with Peggy."
24:21;24:24;"And Don had to like kind of paper over it."
24:24;24:25;"Come smooth it over."
24:25;24:26;"Yeah, exactly."
24:26;24:30;"And Don was like so pissed at Peggy in a way I had not seen yet"
24:30;24:33;"about this like baked ham company."
24:33;24:35;"And I was just like, ""God, this rules."""
24:35;24:38;"Because it like, like the true drama of that show is just them,"
24:38;24:41;"is the characters fighting with each other"
24:41;24:44;"over the most banal marketing decisions"
24:44;24:47;"that are forgotten as soon as they're released."
24:47;24:48;"Right."
24:48;24:50;"It's just, anyway, genius show."
24:50;24:54;"These incredibly serious people just out there"
24:54;24:58;"trying how to trick 10% more people into buying Lucky Strike."
24:58;25:00;"The show has aged incredibly."
25:00;25:03;"Speaking of aged, the aged by audio."
25:03;25:06;"It's aged like hip hop cheese."
25:06;25:08;"Like a fine cheese it."
25:08;25:09;"Like a fine cheese it."
25:09;25:13;"The YouTube video actually premieres in 14 hours."
25:13;25:15;"Cheese It kind of has it in the queue."
25:15;25:17;"And there's a countdown."
25:17;25:19;"So it premieres at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning."
25:19;25:23;"And it can tell you how many people are like queued up waiting for it."
25:23;25:25;"There are two people currently waiting for this video."
25:25;25:27;"And I'm one of them."
25:27;25:29;"Matt's the other."
25:29;25:31;"And the other one works for Cheese It."
25:31;25:32;"That's right."
25:32;25:33;"Yeah."
25:33;25:37;"Cheese It's social media manager is actually not queued quite yet."
25:37;25:38;"Oh, man."
25:38;25:40;"They're going to log in like five minutes before their workday starts."
25:40;25:45;"So, Einfeld, do you have a picture of the aged by audio box?"
25:45;25:46;"What does it look like?"
25:46;25:49;"Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at it on this YouTube video."
25:49;25:51;"It's a normal Cheese It box."
25:51;25:57;"But then it says Cheese It X Pandora underneath like Supreme collaboration style."
25:57;26:03;"Then it's like just oh, then it's a wheel of cheese with a pair of headphones on the cheese."
26:03;26:07;"If you can imagine, it looks kind of like an emoji with no facial features."
26:07;26:10;"And then it says aged by audio over top of it."
26:10;26:15;"100% real cheese aged by hip hop is the copy."
26:15;26:16;"Aged by hip hop."
26:16;26:17;"We got to try this."
26:17;26:21;"I want to get the Stairway to Heaven one and I want to get the Tribe one."
26:21;26:27;"Well, no, they didn't do Stairway to Heaven because it was too smoky."
26:27;26:28;"That was in the original study."
26:28;26:32;"Stairway to Heaven did not taste like shit."
26:32;26:33;"Very bitter."
26:33;26:35;"Mozart tastes like shit."
26:35;26:37;"Tribe Called Quest, pretty good."
26:37;26:39;"Also, there's something about this too."
26:39;26:45;"Like, I guess we've probably come across a lot of campaigns like this, but it's also a reminder that, you know,"
26:45;26:52;"throughout this show and throughout our lives, we've talked a lot about the famous phrase once said to Jake,"
26:52;26:54;"which is ""Rocks played out, dawg."""
26:54;27:01;"Me and Jake being, we are hip hop fans, but, you know, we both have like played in rock bands a lot of our lives."
27:01;27:05;"And we know a lot about rock music and we talk a lot about rock music."
27:05;27:10;"So we've been at times, and it's been such a hip hop ascendant era."
27:10;27:15;"So we've talked so much about the death of rock and the kind of, you know, we have a sense of humor about it,"
27:15;27:19;"but the various indignities facing the rock world."
27:19;27:27;"But I got to say too, hip hop is, you know, going to be turning 50 in the not so distant future."
27:27;27:33;"And as much as hip hop has been a much more vibrant force in the 21st century than rock music,"
27:33;27:37;"although there's obviously been great rock music too, you know,"
27:37;27:43;"hip hop kind of entered a kind of golden period or let's say a third golden period or something."
27:43;27:47;"And there's something about the Cheez-It crackers and the hip hop."
27:47;27:52;"It has like, you know, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac kind of energy where like,"
27:52;28:00;"just like in the 80s and 90s, you saw rock music kind of reach this kind of like funny middle age"
28:00;28:05;"and people who probably remembered it being like this provocative, vibrant force in their youth"
28:05;28:11;"suddenly started seeing rock being used in like, in ways that were alien to them."
28:11;28:15;"Or they couldn't understand how the cultural place had shifted so much or something."
28:15;28:19;"Suddenly I'm just having this vision of like a Gen X dude."
28:19;28:25;"Maybe he had like a decent kind of like underground rap career in the 90s."
28:25;28:27;"Maybe he was like a cool DJ."
28:27;28:36;"Maybe he had like an amazing, you know, underground hip hop radio show in like 1994 on like a local station somewhere."
28:36;28:41;"And then next thing you know, this guy's like in his mid 50s."
28:41;28:46;"As anybody who makes it their mid 50s know, life gets weird, lose people."
28:46;28:48;"You see the ups and downs of life."
28:48;28:55;"Maybe he's like going to just like buy some Cheez-Its for his kids or who knows what."
28:55;28:59;"Maybe he's got the kids for the weekend and he's like, ""Oh, well, I got to go get some f***ing snacks."
28:59;29:04;"They're coming over to my apartment and tired, overworked, bitter, whatever."""
29:04;29:09;"And then just like picking up this box. It's like Cheez-Its, hip hop."
29:09;29:15;"And just like seeing the word hip hop on the Cheez-Its box and just having this like weird moment at the supermarket"
29:15;29:19;"of just like, ""Wow, time has passed."""
29:19;29:26;"I feel like that's probably like, I could picture like a rock dude in the early 2000s in the exact same scenario."
29:26;29:34;"And he's just like having like a buff night ending up at 7-Eleven at 2am and just seeing like Rockstar Energy Drink for the first time."
29:34;29:38;"And just having that same like alienated feeling of just like, you know what I mean?"
29:38;29:40;"Like, ""Oh, yeah, there's something about this."""
29:40;29:48;"The classic rock kind of seminal moment was 1987 Nike used ""Revolution"" by the Beatles in an ad."
29:48;29:52;"20 years or 19 years after that song came out."
29:52;29:56;"""It's gonna be a revolution."""
29:56;29:57;"That was a seminal moment."
29:57;29:59;"I mean, that probably was really weird for people."
29:59;30:06;"Although you could probably even draw a distinction between the moment when something is so big and ubiquitous."
30:06;30:11;"It probably is like a little bit harsh, but it's also somebody probably watched them and was like, ""Wow."""
30:11;30:17;"I never thought I'd live to see the day when the Beatles would be in an advertisement selling sneakers."
30:17;30:23;"But there also might be a part of you that felt like, ""Well, rock really won. Look at it."""
30:23;30:26;"It's this powerful force, this music that I loved as a kid."
30:26;30:28;"Man, I wonder how much these guys got paid for it."
30:28;30:30;"There's something about this."
30:30;30:34;"Well, that's if you're a true boomer and you didn't absorb punk."
30:34;30:37;"Right. Yeah, the punk rockers would have been weirded out by it."
30:37;30:41;"You say you want a revolution."
30:41;30:45;"Well, you know."
30:45;30:51;"We all want to change the world."
30:51;30:54;"You tell me that it's evolution."
30:54;30:58;"Well, you know."
30:58;31:04;"We all want to change the world."
31:04;31:08;"But when you talk about destruction,"
31:08;31:14;"don't you know that you can count me out?"
31:14;31:20;"Don't you know it's gonna be alright?"
31:20;31:24;"Alright."
31:24;31:25;"Alright."
31:25;31:30;"I guess what I'm saying is for any genre, whether it's rock, punk, hip-hop, whatever,"
31:30;31:35;"there's probably a moment when the thing becomes so big and culturally ubiquitous"
31:35;31:37;"that people are passionately fighting about it."
31:37;31:40;"Is it right that the Beatles are in a Nike commercial?"
31:40;31:42;"I don't know, man. That's not what we fought for."
31:42;31:44;"Well, hold on a second, man."
31:44;31:46;"What do you want them to put in? Lawrence Welk?"
31:46;31:48;"And you can see with punk too."
31:48;31:51;"The 90s was like 1991, the year punk broke."
31:51;31:54;"Green Day is this huge band."
31:54;31:55;"People are like, ""They're not real punk."""
31:55;31:56;"Well, hold on, man."
31:56;31:59;"They're bringing punk to the masses. Maybe it's cool."
31:59;32:01;"People are fighting, but at least they're fighting"
32:01;32:04;"because the thing that they care about so much is winning."
32:04;32:07;"And I'm just saying that there's one phase after that,"
32:07;32:12;"which is picking up the Rockstar energy drink at the 7-Eleven phase."
32:12;32:16;"And I would argue that this Cheez-Its is a step beyond that."
32:16;32:18;"Beyond the Rockstar?"
32:18;32:22;"If you're the guy you described, hip-hop's been commodified and used"
32:22;32:24;"by the Don Drapers for so long."
32:24;32:26;"There's something about picking up this hip-hop Cheez-Its"
32:26;32:31;"and at first going, ""Ugh, like Rockstar,"" and then going, ""What is this?"""
32:31;32:38;"I'm like, ""Wait, the cheese that was used in this product has been aged for years?"""
32:38;32:43;"I mean, it's so surreal. It's psychotic."
32:43;32:46;"And Nick, there's an even deeper level to that,"
32:46;32:49;"is that no one's actually picking this up."
32:49;32:53;"This product is so unsettling to me, and I think I know why."
32:53;32:56;"It reminds me a little bit of--"
32:56;33:04;"Remember the Abu Ghraib torture methods where they would blast Metallica and pop music?"
33:04;33:07;"I feel like specifically the ""Load"" album."
33:07;33:10;"Is that what it was? Oh, s***."
33:10;33:12;"Oh, God. Bad Metallica."
33:12;33:15;"It's a little abusive, I feel, to subject--"
33:15;33:17;"I know cheese is not sentient."
33:17;33:21;"It's like changing the material form of something"
33:21;33:24;"through playing loud music at it that then you consume"
33:24;33:27;"because it's a cool, synergistic, ""Oh, hip-hop."""
33:27;33:29;"It's a quirky, weird marketing thing."
33:29;33:31;"There's something very bleak about it."
33:31;33:38;"I also don't believe for a second that the cheese was any different."
33:38;33:40;"They just fully made this up."
33:40;33:44;"That's a good point. Where's the evidence that they played hip-hop nonstop for 6 1/2 months?"
33:44;33:47;"Do you have some time-lapse footage?"
33:47;33:52;"They do a Frank Ocean, Endless-type livestream video?"
33:52;33:54;"That's what they should have done."
33:54;33:56;"That would be a cool art project where it's like,"
33:56;34:00;"""Check out the hip-hop cheese room at the Cheez-It factory."
34:00;34:04;"There's going to be a continuous mix of hip-hop for the next 6 1/2 months."""
34:04;34:06;"That would have been interesting."
34:06;34:08;"If you got all sorts of iconic hip-hop--"
34:08;34:10;"That'd be a good way to get cool hip-hop DJs paid."
34:10;34:15;"Get some old-school '90s hip-hop DJs that maybe aren't on the radio anymore"
34:15;34:19;"and you pay them top dollar to DJ for the cheese."
34:19;34:22;"At least that's getting into some surreal stuff."
34:22;34:25;"Also, another thing I don't love about this, the more I think about it,"
34:25;34:28;"is is a Tribe Called Quest getting paid off of this?"
34:28;34:30;"This could be an interesting lawsuit."
34:30;34:36;"If you use Tribe Called Quest and LL Cool J's music as an ingredient, so to speak,"
34:36;34:40;"in your Cheez-It, and you're using it in the marketing,"
34:40;34:42;"I think you've got to pay them. I think they deserve a royalty."
34:42;34:48;"Oh, and it wasn't just Tribe. It was Beastie Boys, Drake, Eminem, Snoop."
34:48;34:49;"All the big dogs."
34:49;34:51;"All over the place, by the way."
34:51;34:52;"Yeah."
34:52;34:55;"Completely chaotic vibes."
34:55;34:58;"I'm telling you, it's junk science, man."
34:58;35:04;"And if there's no accountability, and it is just a marketing stunt, can we sue them?"
35:04;35:05;"As hip-hop fans?"
35:05;35:07;"Yeah, I want to sue."
35:07;35:08;"Or Cheez-Its fans."
35:08;35:10;"If Jake eats this and there's no difference,"
35:10;35:15;"he says, ""I want you to show the receipts,"" and they go, ""We don't have any video."""
35:15;35:17;"There has to be some accountability."
35:17;35:21;"This product does not exist. That's their argument."
35:21;35:25;"It'll be like when Tucker Carlson gets sued."
35:25;35:28;"He's like, ""I'm an entertainment program."""
35:28;35:31;"Nobody ever said it was news, and Cheez-Its gets sued."
35:31;35:34;"They're like, ""Cheez-Its is an entertainment company."
35:34;35:37;"We never claimed that this was an actual product."
35:37;35:40;"We need to see the six-and-a-half-month hip-hop playlist."""
35:40;35:44;"By the way, can we put on jazz by Tribe Called Quest?"
35:44;35:49;"Because I know this song. Famously, they sampled a lot of jazz."
35:49;35:54;"Q-Tip is one of the greatest sample finders of all time."
35:54;35:58;"So the idea that you could listen to this specific Tribe song"
35:58;36:00;"and it would give the cheese a flavor,"
36:00;36:07;"and then you could throw on some modern hip-hop trap music or something,"
36:07;36:09;"that doesn't make any sense."
36:09;36:12;"I want everybody to listen to this Tribe Called Quest song"
36:12;36:14;"as they take this on."
36:14;36:16;"Let's do this."
36:16;36:22;"Oh yeah, this one."
36:22;36:32;"Beautiful analog drum sounds."
36:32;36:34;"What year is this?"
36:34;36:36;"It's like early '90s. '91."
36:36;36:38;"Sick."
36:39;36:41;"(rapping)"
36:41;36:53;"The upright bass sound."
36:53;36:55;"Maybe the cheese is responding to the upright bass."
36:55;36:59;"I'm a '90s guy. '90s indie rock, '90s rap."
36:59;37:01;"Early '90s hip-hop is..."
37:01;37:03;"Yeah."
37:03;37:05;"It's a magical time."
37:06;37:08;"(rapping)"
37:08;37:15;"Also, Q-Tip and Phife have such unique voices, too."
37:15;37:17;"Maybe it was just Q-Tip's voice."
37:17;37:22;"A lot of dudes have unique voices."
37:22;37:24;"But I'm saying, his unique voice,"
37:24;37:26;"there might have been something in the..."
37:26;37:28;"The cheese?"
37:28;37:31;"In the sonic signature that made the cheese taste better."
37:31;37:33;"Robert Plant was too shrill."
37:33;37:35;"(reading)"
37:35;37:49;"Cheese enthusiast."
37:49;37:51;"This is from NPR."
37:51;37:53;"(reading)"
37:54;37:56;"Cheese enthusiast beat Wamflr."
37:56;37:58;"Affirmed to NPR."
37:58;38:00;"(reading)"
38:01;38:03;"And so the hip-hop cheese was my favorite cheese."
38:03;38:05;"Rock and roll and techno,"
38:05;38:07;"there was not such a big difference."
38:07;38:09;"Apparently, it's not just gimmicky stunt."
38:09;38:11;"According to the report, there are measurable differences"
38:11;38:15;"between the cheeses that go beyond subjective taste preferences."
38:15;38:18;"And if you're concerned about the science,"
38:18;38:20;"the bio-acoustic impact of sound waves"
38:20;38:23;"affects metabolic processes in cheese"
38:23;38:27;"to the point where discernible difference in flavor becomes apparent."
38:27;38:29;"I'm not saying it's impossible,"
38:29;38:32;"but we need to point out that there is something"
38:32;38:34;"I've heard referenced too many times"
38:34;38:36;"called the replication crisis."
38:36;38:39;"And the replication crisis is that"
38:39;38:41;"there's so many studies done,"
38:41;38:44;"including studies you could say are more serious"
38:44;38:46;"than the hip-hop cheese study,"
38:46;38:50;"where results are published, you know, whatever,"
38:50;38:53;"it's somewhat vetted, and then a few years later,"
38:53;38:55;"someone tries to replicate the study,"
38:55;38:58;"and they don't remotely get the same results."
38:58;39:00;"Obviously, what people would call kind of like"
39:00;39:03;"tried-and-true provable science,"
39:03;39:06;"generally, you could replicate it whenever you want."
39:06;39:09;"Like, there's some basic scientific principles."
39:09;39:11;"We could replicate some study that happened 300 years ago."
39:11;39:13;"We would get the exact same results."
39:13;39:16;"But apparently, according to some people,"
39:16;39:18;"there are thousands and thousands of studies"
39:18;39:21;"that have probably had articles written about them,"
39:21;39:23;"have influenced people's thinking,"
39:23;39:25;"that have never been replicated."
39:25;39:28;"Because maybe the original study was like cherry-picked"
39:28;39:31;"or worked randomly, you know what I mean?"
39:31;39:33;"- A fluke. - Right. A fluke."
39:33;39:36;"[rapping]"
40:24;40:29;"I wouldn't put it past Cheez-Its to slightly alter their formula."
40:29;40:32;"It'd be very easy for them to add like a little extra salt or something,"
40:32;40:36;"just to try to reverse engineer this."
40:36;40:37;"To cook the books."
40:37;40:38;"Exactly."
40:38;40:43;"Well, this also begs the question, I'm willing to believe that Cheez-Its create a real cheese-like"
40:43;40:51;"substance, but is there actually a phase of the Cheez-It crackers process when you have like"
40:51;40:55;"actual like traditional blocks of cheese that then is like powdered into something?"
40:55;40:56;"You know what I mean?"
40:56;41:00;"I think what you're saying is really the elephant in the room, which"
41:00;41:03;"I'm surprised they use real cheese, period."
41:03;41:04;"Doesn't that shock you?"
41:04;41:06;"That Cheez-Its are real cheese?"
41:06;41:07;"Well, it's like dehydrated."
41:07;41:12;"It's like some sort of like powderized, like dehydrated form."
41:12;41:17;"It's not like there's like a block of like Wisconsin cheddar."
41:17;41:18;"But I would assume it's like cheese or something."
41:18;41:19;"That's the question."
41:19;41:23;"Is there some part of the Cheez-It process where you do actually get"
41:23;41:27;"big industrial chunks of Wisconsin cheddar, which then is immediately pulverized and"
41:27;41:29;"dehydrated into something?"
41:29;41:30;"So, is there a cheese stage?"
41:30;41:32;"Or is it all chemistry?"
41:32;41:37;"I'm looking at the ingredients on a Cheez-Its box and it's a little sus."
41:37;41:43;"It's like the cheese ingredient is called skim milk cheese and then in brackets, it says skim"
41:43;41:50;"milk, whey protein, cheese cultures, salt enzymes, and some sort of extract that they're"
41:50;41:52;"using for color."
41:52;41:55;"So, it seems like some sort of hybrid synth cheese."
41:55;41:59;"I mean, they might say, well, yeah, they might say, well, those are the ingredients for the"
41:59;41:59;"cheese."
41:59;42:01;"Yeah, that might be."
42:01;42:03;"I don't really know much about cheese making."
42:03;42:04;"But whey protein?"
42:04;42:06;"Doesn't that seem like an odd?"
42:06;42:08;"Whey protein?"
42:08;42:12;"I mean, okay, we got to get a cheese maker on the phone, maybe the next episode."
42:12;42:16;"I think for the next episode, we probably have reached the end of what we can bring"
42:16;42:17;"to the table."
42:17;42:20;"The next episode, we needed a cheese maker and a hip hop expert."
42:20;42:22;"I mean, just fun to be here."
42:22;42:23;"Hip hop expert."
42:23;42:26;"Cheese is not the dominant ingredient in Cheez-It."
42:26;42:27;"That's a fact."
42:27;42:36;"So, the idea that the cheese is aged with hip hop, even if that cheese is sweeter, that"
42:36;42:37;"shouldn't affect the Cheez-It taste."
42:37;42:42;"Cheese isn't an important ingredient enough in Cheez-It."
42:42;42:43;"It's a good point."
42:43;42:45;"I guess it provides the flavor."
42:45;42:51;"I'm picturing again, the kind of like sad sack person in the grocery store and just"
42:51;42:54;"seeing the phrase aged by hip hop just like strikes him to their core."
42:54;42:56;"Aged by hip hop."
42:56;42:57;"That's me, bro."
42:57;42:58;"Damn."
42:58;42:58;"That's me."
42:58;43:00;"All been aged by hip hop."
43:00;43:01;"We've all been aged by hip hop."
43:01;43:04;"Aged by, yeah, aged by classic rock slash indie rock."
43:04;43:06;"Whoa."
43:06;43:10;"From Creedence Clearwater to pavement."
43:11;43:12;"That's what it needs to say."
43:12;43:16;"If I'm going to buy Cheez-It, it needs to say from CCR to GBV."
43:16;43:21;"Imagine running into like an old friend you haven't seen in like 20 years and they're"
43:21;43:23;"like, ""Damn, what happened to you, man?"""
43:23;43:27;"I was an aged by hip hop."
43:27;43:28;"I was aged by hip hop."
43:28;43:29;"What can I say?"
43:29;43:34;"All this talk of cheese, I just should be remiss if I didn't point out I've been holding"
43:34;43:37;"through my tongue for the last 40 minutes."
43:37;43:37;"Damn."
43:37;43:40;"Speaking of fully loaded, nachos."
43:40;43:42;"Oh, yeah."
43:42;43:44;"Good one."
43:44;43:47;"And I didn't want to turn it back, but this seemed like it."
43:47;43:48;"Yeah, yeah."
43:48;43:51;"No, airport bar nachos, fully loaded."
43:51;43:53;"Jalapeno sour cream."
43:53;43:54;"Yeah."
43:54;43:57;"Cars, baked potatoes, and nachos."
43:57;44:01;"I think nachos is actually above baked potatoes in the sort of like popularity of things that"
44:01;44:02;"are fully loaded."
44:02;44:03;"Oh, absolutely."
44:03;44:03;"Right?"
44:03;44:03;"Yeah."
44:03;44:05;"Baked potato, number three."
44:07;44:09;"I mean, of those three things, nachos are my favorite."
44:09;44:12;"It goes nachos, cars, baked potatoes."
44:12;44:17;"You like nachos better than cars?"
44:17;44:17;"I do."
44:17;44:19;"I do."
45:19;45:24;"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. About a month ago, an article made some waves."
45:24;45:25;"A cool organization."
45:25;45:26;"Great organization."
45:26;45:27;"Have you ever been, Jake?"
45:27;45:30;"No. I've never been to Cleveland."
45:30;45:32;"You've never been to Cleveland?"
45:32;45:34;"I've never been to Cleveland."
45:34;45:36;"[laughter]"
45:36;45:37;"New Mountain Bruce."
45:37;45:38;"Yeah."
45:38;45:38;"Wow."
45:38;45:42;"I would love to go, but it's a little bit out of the way."
45:42;45:45;"I mean, you've been to Ohio, right? You've been to Cincinnati."
45:45;45:46;"Didn't we go to Cincinnati together?"
45:46;45:47;"Yeah. I've been to Cincinnati."
45:47;45:52;"I've driven through Ohio, but I've just never been to like..."
45:52;45:56;"Is Cleveland in the north part of Ohio, like on one of the lakes or no?"
45:56;45:57;"Yeah."
45:57;45:57;"Okay."
45:57;45:58;"I think it's up there."
45:58;45:58;"I've never been."
45:58;45:59;"That's my understanding."
45:59;46:04;"I've driven through Columbus and the Dayton area, but not..."
46:04;46:05;"Cheez-Its located..."
46:05;46:06;"More like mid-Ohio."
46:06;46:07;"...founded in Dayton."
46:07;46:08;"Oh."
46:08;46:09;"If we do a trip."
46:09;46:10;"Oh, Cheez-Its from Dayton?"
46:10;46:12;"A lot of great things coming out of Dayton."
46:12;46:15;"I don't know if I've ever been to Dayton, but I've been to Cleveland many times."
46:15;46:18;"Great show. Last time Vampire Weekend was in Cleveland."
46:18;46:20;"Have you been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
46:20;46:22;"No, I've never been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
46:22;46:26;"Nobody's ever suggested it to me. It's never come up."
46:26;46:30;"Really? There's never been like, ""Oh, we got a day off in Cleveland."""
46:30;46:31;"It's in Cleveland?"
46:31;46:31;"Yeah."
46:31;46:34;"I guess I don't really have a feel for where everything is in Cleveland."
46:34;46:37;"I can kind of picture one kind of old downtown part, but"
46:37;46:41;"I'm kind of curious about the story of why it ended up in Cleveland."
46:41;46:42;"True."
46:42;46:45;"It makes a lot of sense. I love it."
46:45;46:48;"I mean, as we've talked about on the show many times, the Midwest is"
46:48;46:51;"true rock country in America."
46:51;46:51;"Yeah."
46:51;46:55;"Where all the bands were touring in the 70s, keeping rock alive."
46:55;46:58;"But yeah, I wonder, there must've been a lot of cities. I guess it was probably just like"
46:58;47:01;"the Olympics or something. A lot of cities making a bid for it."
47:01;47:05;"Maybe Cleveland gave them some tax breaks or something."
47:05;47:09;"But anyway, I personally don't know very much about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"
47:09;47:13;"but about a month ago there was this article where Vulture spoke to two Rock and Roll Hall"
47:13;47:17;"of Fame voters anonymously about their opinions on prospective nominees."
47:17;47:23;"And so they announced the nominees on May 4th. So who actually was nominated on May 4th?"
47:23;47:30;"All right. It was Eminem, Lionel Richie, Carly Simon, Eurythmics, Duran Duran, and Pat Benatar"
47:30;47:32;"were the inductees."
47:32;47:33;"Wow."
47:33;47:34;"And Dolly Parton."
47:34;47:34;"Very little rock."
47:34;47:39;"Yeah. And Dolly Parton was given the honor, but resisted."
47:39;47:44;"She refused the nomination. I remember seeing that. Respect, Dolly."
47:44;47:44;"That's right."
47:44;47:46;"Oh, because she's too country."
47:46;47:47;"She's not rock and roll."
47:47;47:51;"So wait, Seinfeld, those are the artists that got in?"
47:51;47:55;"Those are the ones that got in. The nominees, that's a longer list. It's Beck, Pat Benatar,"
47:55;48:02;"Kate Bush, Devo. The others I mentioned, Judas Priest, Fela Kuti, MC5, New York Dolls,"
48:02;48:09;"Dolly, Rage Against the Machine, Tribe Called Quest, Dionne Warwick of My House fame."
48:09;48:10;"The Tribe Called Quest?"
48:10;48:12;"The Tribe Called Quest? The cheese rappers."
48:12;48:15;"And actually that comes up in this article."
48:15;48:23;"So two rock and roll hall of fame voters anonymously, which is lame, but anonymously"
48:23;48:26;"gave their frank assessments of these different nominees."
48:26;48:30;"So yeah, we have no idea who these people are. I mean, who even, I guess it must,"
48:30;48:33;"they must be somebody with some connection to the music industry."
48:33;48:36;"You know who we know who's a rock and roll hall of fame voter?"
48:36;48:37;"Who?"
48:37;48:39;"Friend of the show, Stephen Hyden."
48:39;48:40;"He's a rock and roll hall of fame voter?"
48:40;48:43;"I'm like 90% sure."
48:43;48:46;"Interesting. So they bring in some critics, probably just like a lot of old school music"
48:46;48:47;"people."
48:47;48:50;"We should have him on the show. Well, I know he has a Pearl Jam book coming out. We should"
48:50;48:55;"have him on there. I'd be very curious to hear about his relationship to that. Because he wrote"
48:55;49:01;"a thing recently about how the rock and roll hall of fame has this insane resistance and blind spot"
49:01;49:10;"to independent and indie music, alternative music, like the replacements, Sonic Youth, whoever."
49:10;49:16;"Any of those bands and our band could be your life. Those bands are now like 40 years old."
49:16;49:17;"They'd definitely be eligible."
49:17;49:22;"Like are the Ramones in the hall of fame? I don't know. Certainly not like Black Flag."
49:22;49:24;"REM must be in."
49:24;49:24;"I wonder."
49:24;49:26;"Because they had mainstream success."
49:26;49:30;"Right. But the rock and roll hall of fame, it likes the big names."
49:30;49:35;"Okay. So Tribe Called Quest, voter number one. Hip hop is great, but hip hop is not rock and"
49:35;49:42;"roll. Okay. Well, that just gets down to immediately like the basic question of what is the"
49:42;49:47;"rock and roll hall of fame? The Low End Theory is a fantastic album. Q-Tip is a very smart dude,"
49:47;49:52;"as well as a great lyricist and great performer. I just don't think they need to be in the rock"
49:52;49:57;"and roll hall. Hip hop should have its own hall of fame or institution. It's almost 50 years old"
49:57;50:03;"now. Similar to Dionne Warwick or Dolly Parton, Tribe Called Quest has this inexplicable way of"
50:03;50:08;"respect because they released that Farewell album a few years back. It wasn't great, but people were"
50:08;50:12;"so excited they came back that everyone decided that they will be into it."
50:12;50:13;"That album was good."
50:13;50:18;"It was old man rap. You don't really need that much old man rap in your life. A lot of the"
50:18;50:20;"critics who loved it were middle-aged dudes."
50:20;50:23;"Is there any way that that voter is not a middle-aged dude?"
50:23;50:24;"There's no way."
50:24;50:29;"This is like some cool, young, 21-year-old rock and roll hall of fame voter who's just like,"
50:29;50:35;"""Man, those old guys getting all excited about Tribe coming back. Not going to catch me voting."""
50:35;50:38;"What? Who are these people?"
50:38;50:41;"Voter number two, they're part of that explosion of fascinating and innovative"
50:41;50:48;"hip hop acts that arrived in '87 or '88. Those types of acts are under-inducted into the hall"
50:48;50:53;"of fame. A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Gangstar all deserve to be in. They're still"
50:53;50:59;"very listenable and a great album band. They're not a singles plus filler band."
50:59;51:06;"Group. The term is group. Certainly a worthy selection. These two voters-"
51:06;51:07;"Great hip hop band."
51:07;51:14;"You could see the confusion of like, ""Should hip hop bands be in the rock and roll hall"
51:14;51:18;"of fame?"" It seems like this weird thing that no one's really figured out."
51:18;51:24;"Yeah. Clearly it's very incoherent. Also, I guess it wouldn't be crazy for the rock and"
51:24;51:29;"roll hall of fame to say, ""What rock and roll really means is the explosion of post-war"
51:29;51:32;"youth culture music starting in the '50s."""
51:32;51:33;"Exactly."
51:33;51:40;"And of course, rock was the dominant form, but R&B is of course part of the evolution of rock."
51:40;51:47;"It would make sense to include hip hop in that sense. Basically what you're talking about is"
51:48;51:55;"American popular music post-1950. And of course, hip hop's part of that. I just feel like the"
51:55;51:58;"rock and roll hall of fame is just so weird."
51:58;52:05;"This is also not even the conversation. Run-DMC was inducted in 2009, The Beastie Boys in 2012,"
52:05;52:09;"Public Enemy in 2013. Yeah. There's so many."
52:09;52:10;"Is Dr. Dre in there?"
52:11;52:18;"NWA is, and Tupac is solo. And Jay-Z was last year."
52:18;52:21;"All right. So this is a mess. I mean, obviously it's not like-"
52:21;52:26;"So voter number one is on that tip of like, ""Rap's not in the hall of fame, in the rock"
52:26;52:26;"hall of fame."""
52:26;52:30;"And yet it is. They don't even know. Clearly nobody knows what's going on over there."

55:50;55:52;"- There you go. - So we'll see."
55:52;55:53;"- It's gonna be like-- - They're not getting the call."
55:53;55:54;"- They're not getting the call for at least 20 years."
55:54;55:57;"- Five or 10 years of rejections"
55:57;55:58;"and then they're gonna get in."
55:58;55:59;"- No, it's gonna take longer than that."
55:59;56:01;"Well, okay, but let's look this up."
56:01;56:06;"Seinfeld 38 Special, Bruce Hornsby, Canned Heat,"
56:06;56:08;"are these artists in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
56:08;56:11;"- And if Limp Bizkit's eligible next year,"
56:11;56:14;"that means Pavement's been eligible for like 10 years."
56:14;56:17;"- Okay, no 38 Special, but the first results"
56:17;56:19;"are like two articles about like,"
56:19;56:23;"why aren't 38 Special in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
56:23;56:25;"- Because they've been eligible since 2003."
56:25;56:28;"- Bruce Hornsby was the presenter."
56:28;56:30;"He's not-- - So hang on loosely."
56:30;56:32;"- He did induct Grateful Dead into the Hall of Fame"
56:32;56:35;"in '94 though, he was the presenter."
56:35;56:37;"- Sick, okay. - I know that doesn't count,"
56:37;56:40;"but and then there's an article."
56:40;56:42;"Bruce is not in and there's another article,"
56:42;56:45;"why isn't Bruce Hornsby in the Hall of Fame yet?"
56:45;56:47;"I think you'll find that as a theme probably"
56:47;56:49;"for anybody on the list."
56:49;56:50;"Who was the other one?"
56:50;56:52;"38 Special, Bruce Hornsby. - Canned Heat."
56:53;56:54;"(laughs)"
56:54;56:55;"- Canned Heat. - Not in."
56:55;56:57;"- No, not in."
56:57;57:01;"Oh, there's a website called notinhalloffame.com,"
57:01;57:04;"which lists all the-- - Okay."
57:04;57:05;"I gotta check this out."
57:05;57:07;"I mean, I'm sorry, but if you played at Woodstock,"
57:07;57:09;"I think you should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
57:09;57:10;"- Oh, wait a second. - Clearly we need"
57:10;57:13;"to start our own, we need just like Jake's Hall of Fame."
57:13;57:14;"- Yeah, dude."
57:14;57:16;"- Jake'shalloffame.com."
57:16;57:19;"- Oh my, notinhalloffame.com is a tight site"
57:19;57:21;"'cause it's like baseball, football, basketball,"
57:21;57:24;"WWE, NASCAR."
57:24;57:25;"- Every Hall of Fame."
57:25;57:28;"- I'm trying to find the music one."
57:28;57:30;"Is Pure Prairie League in the Hall of Fame?"
57:30;57:31;"No."
57:31;57:32;"- Yeah, great question."
57:32;57:36;"♪ Amy, what you wanna do ♪"
57:36;57:38;"- Is Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers"
57:38;57:39;"in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
57:39;57:40;"- Oh, absolutely not and they will never be."
57:40;57:42;"- Okay, so we need to start our own Hall of Fame."
57:42;57:43;"- Yeah."
57:43;57:44;"I mean, basically there needs to be"
57:44;57:47;"like an indie rock Hall of Fame."
57:47;57:49;"And the first inductee is Velvet Underground."
57:49;57:50;"- Yeah."
57:50;57:51;"- And then it goes from there. - They're probably"
57:51;57:52;"the best people. - I bet they are."
57:52;57:53;"- Here's the thing about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
57:53;57:56;"that I guess this is kind of obvious."
57:56;57:57;"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
57:57;58:00;"was such a fundamentally boomer institution."
58:00;58:04;"Like it kind of reached its peak in the early 90s"
58:04;58:07;"when it was like fun for people to see these heroes"
58:07;58:11;"of the 60s and 70s, like the Grateful Dead"
58:11;58:13;"or the Eagles get up on stage"
58:13;58:15;"and everybody's kind of wearing suits."
58:15;58:17;"And it's like, it's the kind of that moment"
58:17;58:18;"of like, look how far we've come."
58:18;58:20;"Wow, rock and roll, man."
58:20;58:22;"Never would have thought we'd all be standing here one day."
58:22;58:23;"Hall of Fame?"
58:23;58:26;"Can you believe Joe Walsh is wearing a tuxedo?"
58:26;58:27;"That was like the epitome of it."
58:27;58:28;"- It's full dead. - In the 90s."
58:28;58:30;"- Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac."
58:30;58:31;"- Exactly."
58:31;58:33;"And now we're in this like,"
58:33;58:35;"so that was like this weird peak"
58:35;58:37;"and it was probably fun for people to watch on TV"
58:37;58:41;"and like, oh, there's Prince jamming with Tom Petty."
58:41;58:43;"It was like this perfect kind of institution"
58:43;58:47;"to celebrate the golden age of rock music."
58:47;58:49;"And then now in the 21st century,"
58:49;58:52;"its mission like barely makes sense anymore."
58:52;58:54;"So we're talking about other genres."
58:54;58:57;"Clearly it's not really about digging deep"
58:57;59:00;"into like the history of like the rock period."
59:00;59:01;"It just doesn't really make sense anymore."
59:01;59:03;"And it's probably gonna be an incoherent mess"
59:03;59:04;"for the next 40 years."
59:04;59:06;"It's not like, I guess at least,"
59:06;59:08;"say what you will about the Oscars,"
59:08;59:10;"another kind of like maligned,"
59:10;59:13;"somewhat incoherent institution."
59:13;59:17;"But like, it's not hard to picture in 30 years,"
59:17;59:21;"the Oscars still exist and new movies come out"
59:21;59:23;"and they win awards and whatever."
59:23;59:25;"And we can at least like see how that tracks"
59:25;59:26;"into the future."
59:26;59:28;"I just can't visualize."
59:28;59:32;"It just doesn't make sense to me that in 20 years,"
59:32;59:35;"I'll be hearing about the rock and roll hall of fame"
59:35;59:39;"and thinking about it and turning it on TV"
59:39;59:41;"and being like, oh, that's pretty tight."
59:41;59:43;"Look at, check it out, man."
59:43;59:47;"MGMT and Mac DeMarco doing a tribute to Beach House."
59:47;59:48;"Wow."
59:48;59:50;"I remember being a kid in the nineties"
59:50;59:51;"and seeing this kind of thing."
59:51;59:53;"I never thought it would happen in my era."
59:53;59:55;"It's just not gonna happen."
59:55;59:55;"Maybe I'm wrong."
59:55;59:58;"- It might because eventually the leadership"
59:58;59:59;"of the hall has to turn over."
59:59;01:00:00;"- I don't know."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"I guess, yeah, maybe."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- It's sort of like the Congress."
01:00:02;01:00:06;"Like everyone in the Congress is like 78 years old."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- I feel like it'll go bankrupt before that."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"I guess that's my point."
01:00:09;01:00:13;"I think the Oscars is like a flexible enough institution"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"that even if it stops,"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"maybe one day the Oscars won't even be on TV,"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"but it'll still be this like Hollywood event."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"- The Oscars makes sense"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"'cause it's limited to the production of one year."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"- Well, exactly."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"That's why, and also because like movies"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"is a time honored tradition"
01:00:29;01:00:33;"in a way that maybe rock and roll isn't."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"Yeah, I mean, look, I could be wrong."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I just don't see."
01:00:36;01:00:39;"- Won't it just become the music hall of fame"
01:00:39;01:00:42;"and just be like, but also just be like a hard rock cafe."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"I mean, it's just gonna be-"
01:00:43;01:00:47;"- Maybe they'll stop inducting people or something."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"It'll just become a regional museum."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"- I just think everyone should be"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"in the rock and roll hall of fame."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"So it's like, here's the nominees."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Pat Benadar."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"I've heard of her."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"She's famous."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"I don't like her music."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- Put her in there."
01:00:58;01:00:58;"- She's in."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Duran Duran, they're in."
01:01:00;01:01:03;"Kate Bush, (beep) genius."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Kate Bush is in the hall of fame."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- Put her in."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"- Rated X Machine, iconic, they're in."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"Carly Simon, not a fan, but come on."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"The Salted Earth."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- You're so vain."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- Epic."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"She's in the hall of fame."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- Classic."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- They could knock this out."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"I mean, they could really knock this all out in like a year."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"- Eminem."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"- In a year?"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"- Eminem, one of the most famous,"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"really the criteria is she's in."
01:01:24;01:01:28;"Somebody walks through Cleveland and stops 20 people"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"and says, have you ever heard of this person?"
01:01:30;01:01:34;"And if more than one person says yes, they're in."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"- New York Dolls."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- Actually, that's the first band on this list"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"where I'm just like, eh."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"- Oh."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"- I don't know."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"I've heard of them."
01:01:41;01:01:42;"- Of course they should be in."
01:01:42;01:01:42;"- I don't know."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"- They're very influential."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"A lot of people would say there's no punk rock"
01:01:45;01:01:45;"without the New York Dolls."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- No, no, no, that's BS."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"New York Dolls to me is like one of those bands"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"I've heard of my entire life."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"I don't know one."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"Matt, can you put on the top played New York Dolls song?"
01:01:54;01:01:55;"I don't know."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"And I'm like, not like a punk scholar,"
01:01:58;01:02:03;"but like, you know, I know music sort of."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"- I've heard of the New York Dolls for 30 years."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"I can't name one song."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Can you name one New York Dolls song?"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- But you've heard of them."
01:02:10;01:02:10;"No, you've heard of them."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"- I've heard of them."
01:02:11;01:02:12;"- That's the important point."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"Tribal Request is in."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- Our email address is 8minutecapecod."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"That's the numeral eight."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"If any New York Dolls fans wanna defend their-"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"- You've heard New York Dolls in so many movies."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"- In or in bars."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"This is the top played New York."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"You know who's a huge New York Dolls fan?"
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- Who?"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"- Morrissey."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"They're one of his biggest inspirations."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Really?"
01:02:32;01:02:36;"- Yeah, Morrissey used to like write little letters"
01:02:36;01:02:40;"to like the NME and Melody Maker when he was like a teenager"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"and he famously wrote one, ""The Ramones are rubbish."""
01:02:43;01:02:44;"When like the Ramones came out"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"and they're getting hyped up in the UK press,"
01:02:46;01:02:50;"he wrote a passionate essay of why the Ramones are rubbish"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"compared to the New York Dolls."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"- Wow."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- He was a New York Dolls super fan."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"- Are the Smiths in the Hall of Fame?"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"- Absolutely not."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"- But Radiohead is."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"- That's a good question."
01:02:59;01:03:03;"- 'Cause Radiohead has massive, massive billboard success"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"in the United States."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- The Smiths were big too."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"- In the UK, not here."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"- Look, it just takes time to get everybody in."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"One day everybody will be."
01:03:15;01:03:21;"- This sucks."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"- DJ, can't you see?"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"This is the roots of punk rock."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- What year is this?"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"- It's like '74, '73."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Oh, okay, respect."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- '74."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- '73."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- '73."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"- '73."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"- All right, okay, that changes things."
01:03:35;01:03:36;"- No, look, you're right."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Listening to this song in particular,"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"if somebody just played this for you,"
01:03:39;01:03:42;"you'd be like, sounds like not as good Rolling Stones."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"But then if you picture them kind of like wearing drag"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"and living downtown New York,"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"they have a song that I like called ""Trash."""
01:03:49;01:03:52;"- This does sound like a real deep album cut"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"on like a Stones record from the '70s."
01:03:59;01:04:01;"- You probably like some Johnny Thunder stuff"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"that he did after."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- So he's the only, that's the only band that I'm like,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"maybe not, but everyone else in."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"- And then of course the singer from the New York Dolls,"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"David Johansson, he went on to create the character"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"Buster Poindexter, who had the huge hit in the '80s,"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Hot, Hot, Hot."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- Terrible, terrible."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"- He's not getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"- He's not getting in either."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Lou Bega."
01:04:23;01:04:27;"- I guess he's in, everyone's in."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- Everyone's in."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"- I think, no, but I'm with you."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"I think anybody who did their thing,"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"the criteria should be, did they do their thing?"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- Yes."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"- And that could either mean critical success,"
01:04:36;01:04:39;"commercial success, one hit wonder."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"- Yeah."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"- Have you heard of them?"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Again, I really think, walk the streets of Cleveland,"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"pull 20 people aside, say,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"have you ever heard of Marcy Playground?"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"Nah, never heard of them."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Have you ever heard of Marcy Playground?"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Oh yes, ""Sex and Candy,"" that was one of the best"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"rock radio songs of the '90s."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Okay, they're in."
01:04:55;01:04:55;"They did their thing."

01:05:51;01:05:53;"- Oh, absolutely. - They Might Be Giants, in."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"- In."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- Tiffany, in."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"- In."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"- Blake Shelton, in."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"- Sabado, in."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"- If we've heard of you, you're in."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"- Super Chunk, in."
01:06:03;01:06:07;"Lemonheads, in."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"- The line should be when you're getting"
01:06:09;01:06:13;"into some very regional stuff."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"- Oh, built a spill?"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Oh, in. - In."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"- Oh, in."
01:06:17;01:06:18;"Little Wings, in."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"- Oh, yeah."
01:06:19;01:06:22;"Little Wings is kind of regional."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"- Look, we're gonna go ahead and stick Little Wings in."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"If some of the other voters disagreed,"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"I can see where they're coming from,"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"but it should be anybody who made a mark."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I mean, Little Wings. - Mount Airy, in."
01:06:34;01:06:36;"- You know what, every band that gets in"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"gets to bring another band,"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"if they're choosing, in with them."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"- That's cool."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"- I love that. - Right, yeah."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"- That's the rock and roll spirit."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"- Spread the love, yeah."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"- I mean, it's a museum."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"It's a museum."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Obviously, we know about Led Zeppelin and the Beatles."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"I'm not gonna go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"to learn about Led Zeppelin."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- I wanna learn about--"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"- You know what the criteria should be?"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"- The band that Led Zeppelin brought in"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"and then the band that that band brought in"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"and the band that that band brought in."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Say that five times. - Exactly."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"- Wait."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"- And also, the criteria shouldn't even be"
01:07:07;01:07:09;"if you did your thing or if you made it."
01:07:09;01:07:12;"The criteria should be how many albums you put out."
01:07:12;01:07:13;"You should have to put out,"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"the criteria shouldn't be how long it's been."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"The criteria should be you have to release"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"minimum seven albums."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"- Oh, I like that. - Sorry, Nirvana."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Nirvana, out. - Out."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Strokes, out."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"Nirvana, out."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"R. Stevie Moore, in."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Jandak, in."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"- Wait a second."
01:07:29;01:07:33;"Every band who has released seven albums,"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"regardless of their stature or--"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"- Not every band. - Oh, not every band."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"- I think the Strokes only have six albums."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"The Strokes will not be eligible"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"until their next album comes out."
01:07:43;01:07:43;"- Every band's in."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"I don't care."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"Every band is in."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"- Jimi Hendrix, out."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"- Well-- - Jimmy Buffet, in."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- Okay, yeah, true."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"We need people who did their thing"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"across minimum seven albums."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"That should be the criteria."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"- The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has a new president,"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Jake Longstreet, and he's really shaking things up."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"He says everybody's in."
01:08:04;01:08:07;"- If I heard you, you're in."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"If I was the president, there would be"
01:08:09;01:08:12;"the Guided by Voices wing."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"- Hell yeah. - They have so many albums."
01:08:13;01:08:16;"- I mean, a great Ohio band."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"- Great Ohio band."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"Actually, GBV I saw is playing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"There's some show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"this summer."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"I was looking at the GBV tour dates."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"- We gotta go after that."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"- Playing a show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:08:30;01:08:35;"I know that there's a special Ohio wing"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"- Okay, that's cool."
01:08:38;01:08:39;"- And they're in there."
01:08:39;01:08:43;"But they need to be top ballot in there."
01:08:43;01:08:44;"- In the entrance."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Oh yeah."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"Wait, so is Eminem gonna show up"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"- I'm sure he will."
01:08:50;01:08:53;"He's like promoting the Minions movie"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"that he's on the soundtrack."
01:08:54;01:08:57;"Like he's like having a moment right now."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"The encore album. - Minions?"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"- Yeah, he's on the Minions soundtrack."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"- What?"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"- He's also in a different soundtrack."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"You know, there's kind of a weird collaboration."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"- I don't like that for him."
01:09:07;01:09:10;"- Well, actually, when he got inducted"
01:09:10;01:09:14;"into the Hall of Fame, he posted something on Instagram"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"which was like a Minions crossover."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"Did you see this?"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"- So he was inducted?"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"- I, hang on a second."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"I need to give the right context."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"I guess he, okay, hang on."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"So wasn't he inducted, first of all?"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- I don't know, when did they think--"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- No, no, he was inducted."
01:09:30;01:09:34;"And then they're gonna have the ceremony and the reception."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"- So on May 7th, he posts, it's this weird illustration"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"where it says the Minions congratulate Eminem."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"I'll text it to you guys."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"And then it says Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2022"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"underneath it."
01:09:45;01:09:48;"And then his caption is Minions got my back."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Shout out to Gru and them."
01:09:50;01:09:53;"I guess Gru, Gru is what, Steve Carell?"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"- There's a character."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"- Okay. - Oh."
01:09:55;01:09:57;"Minions got my back."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"That's hard, dude."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Minions, you're in."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"If I heard of you, you're in."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"- Oh, he's on the Elvis soundtrack as well."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"He's a collaboration with CeeLo."
01:10:09;01:10:12;"- CeeLo, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you're in."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"Minions, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you're in."
01:10:15;01:10:18;"Cast of Euphoria, welcome to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Donald Trump Jr., you're in."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- You're in, dude."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"Put out your seventh album and you're in, dude."
01:10:24;01:10:29;"- Now it's just anybody that you've ever heard of."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"Pete Davidson, welcome to the hall, brother."
01:10:32;01:10:38;"It's anybody that Jake's heard of."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- And if he hasn't heard of you, he'll trust it."
01:10:40;01:10:45;"Damn."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"- Andre Agassi, it should be also people"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"with a rock and roll attitude."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"I wonder if that'll happen."
01:10:50;01:10:54;"One day they'll fully run out of enough superstars."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"Nobody cares about actual rock music."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"It's just about superstars."
01:10:58;01:11:03;"And if they've already skipped ahead to Eminem,"
01:11:03;01:11:06;"then that means Post Malone will probably be inducted"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"in a few years, and then they'll just be out of music."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"And then they'll literally start being-"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- Mickey Rourke, you're in. - People with rock"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"and roll attitudes."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Mickey Rourke, Pete Davidson."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"- Elon Musk."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"- Oh yeah, the whole tech."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"I mean, Travis Kalanick from Uber."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"- Elon Musk, welcome to the hall."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"- Dude, Elizabeth Holmes, you're in."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"- Martin Shkreli."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"- Elizabeth Holmes."
01:11:26;01:11:28;"- I mean, you gotta throw Bezos."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"- The punk rock spirit of Theranos."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"- You know Bezos is first in line."
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- Welcome to the hall."
01:11:33;01:11:38;"If you're any type of renegade or disruptor, you're in."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"- You're a rock star."
01:11:39;01:11:43;"- Jake and Logan Paul, welcome to the hall."
01:11:43;01:11:46;"- Mark Zuckerberg, welcome to the hall."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"(laughing)"
01:11:48;01:11:54;"- Anna Delvey, welcome to the hall."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"Anna Delvey, 2041 inductee."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"You did your damn thing, girl."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"- Here's the thing, okay."
01:12:00;01:12:03;"- Reid Hoffman, CEO of Netflix, you're in."
01:12:03;01:12:09;"- Seven albums or $40,000."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"- Right, right."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"- You paid $40,000?"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"Mountain Brews copped up 40 grand and they're in."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"- They crowdsourced 40 grand."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"- Yep, easily."
01:12:22;01:12:24;"- Welcome to the hall."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"But actually, the more that I think about it,"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"I bet we could start some dumb ass (beep)"
01:12:28;01:12:31;"We like team up with like an energy drink"
01:12:31;01:12:32;"or Cheez-Its or some (beep)"
01:12:32;01:12:35;"and we just start like the Renegades Hall of Fame"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"and just every year we basically throw"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"an idiocracy type event where we just invite"
01:12:40;01:12:44;"the most like (beep) aggressive"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"kind of like meme worthy people to be inducted."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"Like we would literally be like,"
01:12:48;01:12:52;"we're inducting Elon Musk, Jake and Logan Paul."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"- Insane Clown Posse."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"- Insane Clown Posse."
01:12:56;01:13:00;"People who are gonna give Marjorie Taylor Greene."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"Just people who are gonna give like insane speeches"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"and we just kind of let it play out."
01:13:04;01:13:09;"Like Bad Baby, Donald Trump."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"And it just kind of becomes like the Renegades Hall of Fame."
01:13:12;01:13:15;"- Chief Marketing Officer of Cheez-Its,"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"welcome to the hall."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"- Welcome to the hall."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"- Damn."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"- We could actually get some real eyeballs on that."

01:14:13;01:14:15;"- I saw Pavement on Monday night."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"I know, I'm just kind of buried."
01:14:16;01:14:18;"- Why, they haven't played in years."
01:14:18;01:14:19;"Pavement from the '90s?"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"- Pavement from the '90s, man."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"I'm flashing back to eating my fully loaded"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"baked potato in my F-250."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Listening to Wowie's Album."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"- They're still touring Terror Twilight?"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"- Yeah, they've been touring that for 23 years."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"- I guess they probably had to cancel a few shows"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"'cause of COVID, so they're making them up"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"just to finish out the Terror Twilight tour."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"- Yeah."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"- How was the show?"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- It was fun, it was cool."
01:14:42;01:14:45;"I mean, you know, I have like a deep decades long"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"relationship with their catalog."
01:14:47;01:14:51;"Only five albums, so not eligible for the whole."
01:14:51;01:14:52;"(laughing)"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"- Sorry, Pavement."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"- But they played, I mean,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"there are no Pavement deep cuts to me."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Like, I know all of the songs."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"- So you knew literally every song they played?"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"- Yes, except for the last song was like a cover"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"of someone who I didn't know who it was."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Although I have it in my texts."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"- Yeah, let's look it up."
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Who'd you go to the show with?"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"- Friend of the show, Alex Skordelis,"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"the Pearl Jam aficionado."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"So they closed with a song by this guy, Jim Pepper."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Are you familiar? - No, I don't."
01:15:21;01:15:22;"No."
01:15:22;01:15:23;"- I'm bringing up the set list here."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"- When they would bust into a song,"
01:15:25;01:15:28;"would you turn to Alex and just be like,"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"name it, name the album it's on?"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"- Oh yeah, it was a very confrontational hangout."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"(laughing)"
01:15:34;01:15:37;"No, I mean, Pavement's his favorite band."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"I mean, we do all the songs."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"I was like, okay, they're playing ""Grave Architecture."""
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Okay, deep, cool."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"- Yeah."
01:15:43;01:15:44;"- And we'd be like halfway through the show,"
01:15:44;01:15:47;"like, dude, they haven't played ""Stop Breathing"" yet."
01:15:47;01:15:48;"They haven't played ""In the Mouth of Desert."""
01:15:48;01:15:50;"They haven't played ""AT&T"" yet."
01:15:50;01:15:53;"So like, they're leaving a lot on the table."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"It was a fun show."
01:15:54;01:15:57;"I mean, I saw the response on social media,"
01:15:57;01:16:00;"and of course it was nothing but love."
01:16:00;01:16:02;"I honestly thought they were pretty shaky."
01:16:02;01:16:03;"And that's like, you know,"
01:16:03;01:16:06;"that's kind of the Pavement aesthetic a little bit."
01:16:06;01:16:07;"- Well, people are just gonna be so psyched"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"to see a band back at it."
01:16:09;01:16:12;"- Yeah, I didn't think they crushed it."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- But it was a warmup show."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- It was a warmup show."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"It felt like a warmup show."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"- That's what a warmup show is all about."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"When you go to a warmup show,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"you are running the risk that the band might be shaky."
01:16:23;01:16:24;"They might not crush it."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"- Yeah, they were shaky."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I mean, Pavement's always a little shaky."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"Yeah, I mean, we were talking with Alex last show"
01:16:30;01:16:34;"about maybe a little too professional"
01:16:34;01:16:36;"on the drums for Pearl Jam."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"I feel like Steve West, the Pavement drummer,"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"is like kind of barely holding it together."
01:16:41;01:16:44;"(laughing)"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"He seemed a little out of shape or something."
01:16:46;01:16:50;"Like, Malcolm S. just seemed like heads and shoulders"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"above everyone else in the band, which you don't want."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"Everyone else seemed like,"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"oh man, I haven't played a gig in a minute."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"- Well, it's my personal belief that the front man"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"should always be worst on stage."
01:17:00;01:17:02;"(laughing)"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"I think that's what the people want."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"You got a strong foundation."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Everybody else is crushing it."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"Singer not crushing it."
01:17:09;01:17:10;"That's okay."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- Yeah, this felt like Malcolm S."
01:17:12;01:17:17;"with a bunch of guys that just got called up to the majors"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"who were a little nervous or something."
01:17:19;01:17:19;"I don't know."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"I mean, that could be me."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"- Yeah, and he's probably done way more shows"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"in the past 20 years than them."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"- Of course."
01:17:25;01:17:28;"- Seems like they did seven songs off ""Slanted"""
01:17:28;01:17:29;"and ""Enchanted."""
01:17:29;01:17:31;"- Opened with ""Our Singer,"" which was sick."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"'Cause that song was just drums"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"and then Steve on guitars and vocals."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"Very kind of minimalist song."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"And then as they were playing it,"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"the other guys in the band kind of trickled out on the stage."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"- Kind of a stop making sense type move."
01:17:46;01:17:47;"- Mm-hmm."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"- What was the crowd like?"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Similar to Pearl Jam Show?"
01:17:50;01:17:54;"- Yeah, men and women in their,"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"maybe there was some younger crew there."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"I don't really know."
01:17:57;01:18:00;"I mean, really fun to see."
01:18:00;01:18:02;"I mean, just an incredible catalog."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"Like, oh, they're playing ""Types Slowly."""
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Okay, I'm in."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"Let's do ""Types Slowly."""
01:18:07;01:18:10;"- I wonder how much they'll be switching up the set lists."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"I guess that's the thing."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"When you don't make it to the seven plus album territory,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"you can only switch up the set list so much."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"You can't be Pearl Jam."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"With Pearl Jam at 12 albums."
01:18:20;01:18:21;"- Right."
01:18:21;01:18:24;"I mean, they played two songs off ""Watery Domestic,"""
01:18:24;01:18:25;"which was really cool."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"Which was like a very like--"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"- EP?"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"- Crucial EP between ""Slanted"" and ""Crooked."""
01:18:31;01:18:33;"Do you know that EP?"
01:18:33;01:18:34;"- Not really."
01:18:34;01:18:36;"- Matt, throw in ""Sideways."""
01:18:36;01:18:39;"That's like, to me, is like the quintessential Pavement song."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"- Yeah, I don't even know if I know this."
01:18:41;01:18:44;"I felt like I know ""Slanted"" and ""Enchanted"" pretty well."
01:18:44;01:18:48;"And kind of, I have a very random relationship to Pavement."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"I feel like I had ""Slanted"" and ""Enchanted,"""
01:18:50;01:18:54;"then somebody gave me ""Terror Twilight."""
01:18:54;01:18:54;"- Okay."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"- Which I thought was a pretty good album."
01:18:55;01:18:57;"- I know people like,"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"that's like controversial with the heads."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"- It's not, yeah."
01:19:00;01:19:02;"I think it's by far their worst record."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"- They had some good songs on it."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"- They definitely did."
01:19:06;01:19:08;"- Jake, what's the song?"
01:19:08;01:19:08;"- Hold on, hold on."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"Let me just--"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"- ""Sideways."""
01:19:10;01:19:11;"- Sorry, dude."

01:19:12;01:19:13;"- ""Front Words?"""
01:19:13;01:19:14;"- I meant ""Front Words."""
01:19:14;01:19:15;"""Front Words."""
01:19:15;01:19:18;"""Sideways"" is an Alexander Payne movie"
01:19:18;01:19:22;"starring Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"- Which you're also a big fan of."
01:19:23;01:19:24;"- Yeah."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"They played this second in the set."
01:19:30;01:19:36;"To me, this is like, yeah,"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"it's like if you're gonna play ""Pavement"""

01:24:23;01:24:26;"But then we would just like do covers sometimes."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"And we did a bunch of like indie rock covers,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"which is interesting to think about."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"'Cause like at that time,"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"I don't think I was like that into indie rock per se,"
01:24:35;01:24:39;"but I remember we played Sugar Cube by Yola Tango."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"I think it might've been because this dude Dan"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"was like a real like indie head,"

01:24:56;01:24:58;"Yeah, it's funny, now that I think about it,"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"like I did have relationship to all this music."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"And I love Yola Tango."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"I was just listening more to like fake book,"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"like early folky Yola Tango than the real like"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"later indie stuff."
01:25:09;01:25:12;"But yeah, I remember playing Shady Lane."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"So that's like the Pavement song I know the best."
01:25:14;01:25:15;"'Cause we actually like would,"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I probably covered it."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"- That's interesting 'cause that's from"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Right in the Corners, which is '97,"

01:25:42;01:25:43;"- Hard disagree."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- Hard, okay, no, no, it makes sense that I wouldn't know."
01:25:45;01:25:49;"- I think the last, I mean, yeah, the first three albums,"
01:25:49;01:25:53;"like I think they got worse with every album, basically."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"I think Slanted is their best."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"I love Crooked."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"I think Crooked's maybe right there with it."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"I think Wowie Zowie's a little bit of a drop off,"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"but I love it."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"- I love Wowie Zowie."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"- I love Wowie, but it's not,"
01:26:05;01:26:09;"it doesn't reach the heights of Slanted and Crooked,"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"or Watery Domestic."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"And then, you know, Right in the Corners,"
01:26:13;01:26:14;"kind of a sterile sound,"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"kind of their like do the collapse or something."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"And then Terry Twilight's kind of a mess,"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"I mean, with some good songs."
01:26:21;01:26:23;"All the records have great songs on them."
01:26:23;01:26:26;"But like that band got worse and worse,"
01:26:26;01:26:27;"and so it makes sense that they broke up."
01:26:27;01:26:30;"- But you can still catch them live,"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"on tour, this summer, and this fall."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"I'm looking at their--"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"- Jake's going with me in September, October."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"- We're gonna go."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"I'll see him again."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"- Here in LA?"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"- You wanna come?"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"- TC, field trip, Seinfeld, you're in too."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- No choice."
01:26:45;01:26:45;"- Let's do it."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"- No choice, dude."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"- They're in the Hall of Fame, right?"
01:26:49;01:26:49;"- No."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"- Only five albums."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"- They're not, no, sorry, Pavement."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"- Are they 40K?"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"- They can probably go up to 40K."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"- Yeah, maybe they go up to 40K, they can come in."
01:27:00;01:27:03;"I might go catch their show at the Met in Philadelphia."
01:27:03;01:27:06;"I like that venue, 'cause that's the first time I saw Phish."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"- Okay, cool."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"- That's where I like to go see bands that start with P,"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"is the Met in Philadelphia."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"All right."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"- Top five. - Let's get into this top five."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"- It's time for the top five,"
01:27:16;01:27:21;"f-f-f-f-f-f-f-five on iTunes."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"This week on the top five,"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"we're comparing the top five hits of today"
01:27:25;01:27:28;"to the top five Billboard hits this week in 1974."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"Why 1974?"
01:27:30;01:27:33;"Because it's the year that I said"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"that New York Dolls song was from,"
01:27:35;01:27:37;"even though I was incorrect and it was 1973,"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"but at first I said '74."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"- Okay. - No, the real reason is"
01:27:41;01:27:44;"because this is episode 174."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"- Love it."
01:27:45;01:27:48;"- And they did not have a Billboard chart in the year 174,"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"so we made it 1974."
01:27:50;01:27:53;"- Next episode we're doing 1975."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"- Yeah, we just keep doing that for the next."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"- 40 years, or 40 episodes."
01:27:59;01:28:02;"- The number five song this week in 1974,"
01:28:02;01:28:05;"Paul McCartney and Wings with ""Band on the Run."""
01:28:05;01:28:06;"- Classic."
01:28:06;01:28:11;"Interesting, songwriters, Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney."
01:28:11;01:28:15;"- Yeah, there's a bit of debate about that."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"I mean, I think McCartney would always claim"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"that Linda helped write the songs,"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"and I feel like there was some school of thought"
01:28:21;01:28:24;"that it was some sort of like publishing scam,"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"where by giving her credit, giving her some publishing,"
01:28:27;01:28:31;"it didn't have to flow through the usual entities"
01:28:31;01:28:34;"and could go directly back to his household or something."
01:28:34;01:28:34;"I don't know."
01:28:34;01:28:36;"- Like a tax thing?"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"- Maybe."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"I'm willing to believe Paul and Linda were very close"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"and she threw out some ideas."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Why not?"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"- Hell yeah."

01:29:05;01:29:07;"that was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"- Oh yeah."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"- Which always tripped me out."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"The band went down to, I don't know if it's Lagos or Lagos,"
01:29:13;01:29:18;"but Lagos, Nigeria, a massive city."
01:29:18;01:29:21;"Like a New York City sized city."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"- Yeah, Nigeria is one of the most populous countries"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"in the world."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"- Is that where Fela's from?"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"- Yeah."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"- So they recorded this record down there?"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"It's so trippy."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"- Well, and also it's like,"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"there's so many classic stories about like,"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"band going down to Jamaica to record"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"and they do a reggae song or something."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"As far as I know, this record,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"and there's a bunch of amazing music happening"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"in Nigeria at the time, but it's not like,"
01:29:44;01:29:49;"""Oh yeah, Paul had some Fela's band on the record."""
01:29:49;01:29:52;"Or he had some Nigerian vibes, nothing like that."
01:29:52;01:29:57;"- This could have been recorded in London or in Bangor, Maine."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"- Yeah."

01:30:14;01:30:24;"- I wonder like, when they were recording in Lagos,"
01:30:24;01:30:28;"like if they would like, on the weekend, like go out,"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Paul McCartney just like wandering around."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"- Just like hit a club?"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"- Yeah, a restaurant, bar, like just wandering around."
01:30:33;01:30:36;"- I'm sure they must've been hitting restaurants and bars."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"I'm sure Paul was a celebrity there."
01:30:37;01:30:40;"Just like the Beatles are just so globally famous."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"- Yeah."
01:30:41;01:30:42;"- And I'm sure it would have been in the newspapers,"
01:30:42;01:30:45;"like, ""Beatle comes to Nigeria."""
01:30:45;01:30:46;"- Yeah."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Have you seen Paul McCartney play ever?"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"- No, you know, he played at SoFi Stadium recently."
01:30:51;01:30:52;"- Yeah."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"- Somebody said to me, ""Oh, you never saw him,"
01:30:54;01:30:55;"""you should go."""
01:30:55;01:30:58;"And I was like, ""Ah, it's a little late to get it together."""
01:30:58;01:31:00;"Like, he won't be touring forever."
01:31:00;01:31:05;"- Yeah, a lot of people I know went to that show at SoFi."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"I don't know, for some reason I was sort of just like,"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"""I'm good."""
01:31:07;01:31:10;"- I mean, deep down, going to a stadium"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"just sounds like a pain in the ass."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"- Yeah, I mean, we went to Pearl Jam,"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"'cause we were at the Forum."
01:31:16;01:31:19;"Vampire Weekend tour manager, Brian, kind of arranged it."
01:31:19;01:31:20;"- Yeah, he had the hookup."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"- But yeah, going to see Paul McCartney"
01:31:22;01:31:26;"and watching him from like 2,000 feet away"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"just seems like, I don't know."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"- I bet it's a pretty tight vibe once you're there,"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"but like-- - Yeah."
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Even like us going to Pearl Jam,"
01:31:33;01:31:36;"like, we were in the same building as the band,"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"but like, I don't know, I don't feel like I really saw them."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"- You saw the band?"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- Yeah, I mean, we were like, sort of close,"
01:31:43;01:31:46;"but like, my memories are like--"
01:31:46;01:31:47;"- Watching the Jumbos?"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"- Video footage on the Jumbotron."
01:31:49;01:31:50;"- Right."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"- And my memories are like hanging out"
01:31:52;01:31:55;"at like the Forum Club with you, Brian, and Adam,"
01:31:55;01:31:57;"and just like having some beers,"
01:31:57;01:32:00;"and like the car ride down, the car ride back,"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"the hot dogs in the parking lot."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"- That's what it's all about."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"I mean, yeah, going to see any concert,"
01:32:05;01:32:06;"it's gotta be a good vibe."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"You gotta like the venue,"
01:32:08;01:32:09;"like the people you're going with."
01:32:09;01:32:10;"- Yeah."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"- That's like 80% of it."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"- But I mean, with a big venue,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"it's like you're not even like remotely close."
01:32:15;01:32:18;"Like, most shows I go to are small,"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"and like, I'm like, you know,"
01:32:19;01:32:22;"maybe like 30 feet from like the performer."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"- Right, that's way more intimate."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"But I think even on a big show--"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"- 400 feet from like Eddie Vedder,"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"I can barely see him, just like, it's just like--"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"- Well, that's why it's gotta be a good atmosphere."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"- Yeah."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"- So, if you like the venue,"
01:32:36;01:32:38;"you like the people you're with,"
01:32:38;01:32:39;"and the band is tight,"
01:32:39;01:32:42;"it doesn't matter if the singer (beep) up a lot,"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"misses some lyrics,"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"messes up a few guitar parts."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"That's my personal belief."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I think you're gonna have a good night out,"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"as long as the band is tight,"
01:32:51;01:32:52;"and you go with friends."
01:32:52;01:32:55;"If so, the singer can (beep) up all night long,"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"and you're gonna have a good time."
01:32:56;01:32:57;"That's my personal belief."
01:32:57;01:33:00;"- Yeah, this is good for your psychology."
01:33:00;01:33:01;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
01:33:01;01:33:04;"- Ezra's like, ""The singer's the weakest link in the band."""
01:33:04;01:33:07;"(laughs)"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"- As long as you have a ringer band,"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"the singer can suck, it's fine."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"I think my favorite show that we've seen,"
01:33:13;01:33:13;"'cause I feel like, okay,"
01:33:13;01:33:16;"I'm gonna try to remember, like, TC shows we've seen."
01:33:16;01:33:17;"- That we've seen together."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"- Yeah, Eddie Vedder, we've seen Roger Waters,"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"we've seen Bob Seger."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"- And Dead & Company."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"- And Dead & Company."
01:33:22;01:33:24;"I think Bob Seger was the best show."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"- The best performance?"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"- Just my favorite."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"I don't know, even wouldn't know what I'm saying."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"I just came away from the Bob Seger show at the Forum"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"that we went to with Ariel,"
01:33:33;01:33:36;"like, with the warmest feeling in my chest."
01:33:36;01:33:39;"- It was a feel-good show, he had a great energy."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"- Surprisingly deep catalog."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"- That was a great show."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"I mean, Dead & Company was special"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"'cause it was at Dodger Stadium, it was outdoors,"
01:33:47;01:33:50;"you watched the sun go down."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"You know, it had a special energy,"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"but like, that was bigger than the music."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"That was like the whole atmosphere."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"- John's ripping solos."
01:33:58;01:34:01;"- Bob Seger was a great show."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"I think just like once I started doing shows,"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"I just was like very uninterested in going to shows,"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"you know, just 'cause it was a bit of a busman's holiday."
01:34:07;01:34:08;"- Sure."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"- You know, just like, I spent so much time in venues"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"that I didn't exactly like,"
01:34:12;01:34:15;"rarely like go out of my way to see something."
01:34:15;01:34:18;"But I always like when someone just like,"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"encourages me to go, I'm always happy I went."
01:34:20;01:34:22;"Yeah, and Bob Seger, that was a real special one."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"The number five song this week in Apple Music,"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Jack Harlow with ""First Class."""
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Jake, do you know who Jack Harlow is?"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"- No, I've heard this name so much"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"- It just makes me think of Jack Sparrow."
01:34:35;01:34:55;"So this is like, not what I thought."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Like, because this thing is,"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"did you know it was going to be rap?"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"- No."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"- You thought it was going to be country?"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"- No, because the name is Jack,"
01:35:03;01:35:06;"I thought it was going to be like singer songwriter."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"- Oh yeah, that is a pretty singer songwriter name,"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Jack Harlow."
01:35:09;01:35:12;"- It's very like, Jack is like such an old school,"
01:35:12;01:35:17;"like kind of 50s style name, Jack Kennedy,"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Jack Johnson. - Or even like,"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"Jack Johnson, more modern."

01:36:53;01:36:55;"- Yeah, I don't know what to make of this, it's all right."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"- This sucks, I think this sucks."
01:36:57;01:36:59;"I'm just like whatever, I'm out."

01:37:00;01:37:01;"Jack Harlow, you're in."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Welcome to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"- You're in dude, I've heard of you."
01:37:05;01:37:06;"- Jake has now heard your music."
01:37:06;01:37:08;"- I'm out, you're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
01:37:08;01:37:11;"- I mean his label will put up that $40,000, no problem."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"- Oh easily."
01:37:12;01:37:16;"- I think he's like the White Drake, personally."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- You're in."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"- Oh, I don't know, that doesn't,"
01:37:19;01:37:20;"I mean I like that song actually,"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"but I think that like he's like--"
01:37:22;01:37:23;"- It's not a bad song."
01:37:23;01:37:24;"Drake has a real track record."
01:37:24;01:37:25;"I mean you--"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"- Yeah."
01:37:26;01:37:29;"- Those are big words of praise that you're issuing."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"- But Seinfeld's not the only one to say this."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"I feel Drake would say this."
01:37:33;01:37:34;"- Oh yeah."
01:37:34;01:37:35;"- I feel like he's sort of being,"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"like they went to the Kentucky Derby together."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"I feel like there's a major part of like"
01:37:40;01:37:43;"Jack Harlow's sort of glow up and like change"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"and like even the softer song"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"and there's a lot of work with Drake."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"I feel like there's a big cosign there."
01:37:49;01:37:50;"- I gotta let this guy out."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"I gotta get an image."
01:37:51;01:37:56;"There's definitely a dude who grew up loving 90s hip hop,"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"still found something to root for in the 2000s"
01:37:59;01:38:02;"and this year, oh my God, this guy's look."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"- He's just like a normal--"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"- He's like a frat boy vibes like--"
01:38:07;01:38:12;"- Or just like a guy in a band or just like, oh my God."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"- He's not trying to be something he's not."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"- No, I mean respect."
01:38:15;01:38:17;"- He has a song, I was listening to this album"
01:38:17;01:38:21;"a few days ago, he has a song on there called Dua Lipa,"
01:38:21;01:38:25;"which sort of uses like Dua Lipa as like a jumping off point"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"to talk about a lot of other stuff."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Friend of the show Dua Lipa."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"It's a good jam."
01:38:30;01:38:31;"- Dua Lipa."
01:38:31;01:38:33;"- Was there a thing that he get a lot of people hated"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"on his album?"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"I kind of ambiently picked that up."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Or is it just like, is it like Drake?"
01:38:38;01:38:39;"Is he literally the next Drake?"
01:38:39;01:38:41;"And that he has a ton of fans,"
01:38:41;01:38:45;"like kind of critical types never quite give it up."
01:38:45;01:38:48;"And yet it's like every time a Drake album comes out,"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"there's always like a million people being like,"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"""Sucks, trash, hate Drake."""
01:38:51;01:38:53;"And then it's huge."
01:38:53;01:38:56;"So Jack Harlow's more of a Drake than he is a Kanye"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"or a Kendrick, or if we were talking about"
01:38:58;01:39:01;"some of the biggest rappers of recent memory."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- Yeah, I would say so."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"I'd say the haters are making him famous."
01:39:04;01:39:08;"And it's like, yeah, it's like one of those, to me,"
01:39:08;01:39:11;"it's like one of those like, you know, when Eminem came out"
01:39:11;01:39:14;"and then they did like Bubba Sparks and then Iggy Azalea."
01:39:14;01:39:17;"I feel like they're like, how do we do the next Drake?"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"But like..."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"- But in the case of Jack Harlow,"
01:39:21;01:39:24;"hip hop radio loves him, right?"
01:39:24;01:39:28;"So he's, you know, I feel it's when you're reading that,"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"and I don't know if you looked at sort of Pitchfork,"
01:39:30;01:39:34;"or there's just a certain part of the critical class"
01:39:34;01:39:37;"that just wants to not like him, you know?"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"And so..."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"- And also like Drake, I get the thing is,"
01:39:40;01:39:41;"he's a bit of a ham."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"He's like got a little bit of like that"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"sublimated theater kid energy."
01:39:45;01:39:49;"That means he won't stop trying and he'll,"
01:39:49;01:39:52;"he's smart and he'll keep dazzling the haters."
01:39:52;01:39:55;"And then in 10 years, people will be like,"
01:39:55;01:39:56;"I mean, you know what?"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Jack Harlow, he's just part of American culture."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"He's, you know, say what you will about the music."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"- He's a ball."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"- Yeah, he never said he was the next Kendrick."
01:40:05;01:40:06;"- Yeah."
01:40:06;01:40:07;"- He's hosting the ESPYs."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"Jack Harlow's definitely gonna be like hosting the ESPYs"
01:40:10;01:40:13;"and like probably make a movie."
01:40:13;01:40:17;"- Yeah, well, but a little more something."
01:40:17;01:40:21;"- I feel like LL Cool J has hosted so many award shows."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"- Oh yeah, he had a good run in the early 2000s."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- Yeah."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"- I think it's like, there's a Will Ferrell movie"
01:40:26;01:40:29;"and Jack Harlow's got like six lines in it"
01:40:29;01:40:30;"and you're like, oh (beep)"
01:40:30;01:40:31;"Jack Harlow."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"- Exactly."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"- You know, I actually believe he's making his transition"
01:40:35;01:40:39;"into film TV by starring in the remake"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"of ""White Men Can't Jump."""
01:40:41;01:40:42;"- Oh yeah, there you go."
01:40:42;01:40:43;"- Wait, wait, wait, is he starring in it?"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"- My understanding is the Woody Harrelson character."
01:40:46;01:40:46;"- Who's the other?"
01:40:46;01:40:47;"- He's Woody Harrelson?"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"- Yeah, who's the, and then somebody else interesting"
01:40:49;01:40:50;"is the co-star, right?"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Who is it?"
01:40:51;01:40:54;"- Who's gonna be the Wesley Snipes character?"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"- Yeah, it's a lesser known actor named Synqua Walls"
01:40:57;01:41:00;"who was in ""Friday Night Lights,"" I guess."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"I thought it was somebody else."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"- Okay, so, this is gonna be some career makeup."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"- Hollywood does not wanna touch the identity politics stuff,"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"the racial stuff that happened."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"We're just gonna make both the guys white"
01:41:09;01:41:10;"and just really."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"(laughing)"
01:41:11;01:41:14;"- ""White Men Can't Jump"" is seen as a bit problematic"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"through today's lens."
01:41:16;01:41:20;"So to avoid some of those uncomfortable situations,"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"the film will star Jack Harlow"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"and the drug dealer from ""Euphoria."""
01:41:24;01:41:26;"(laughing)"
01:41:26;01:41:27;"- Fez."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"- Fez."
01:41:29;01:41:33;"- Oh, Angus McCloud, or Angus Cloud?"
01:41:33;01:41:37;"Who's referenced on that Fergie song that Jack Harlow does."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"There's a lyric about Angus Cloud."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"- It's maybe the most cringe line in the song."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Who's Angus Cloud?"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"- The drug dealer from ""Euphoria."""
01:41:45;01:41:46;"- He is the actor."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- He plays Fez from ""Euphoria."""
01:41:47;01:41:49;"- But that Fergie song is old."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"- No, no, on the--"
01:41:50;01:41:51;"- Oh, no, the Jack Harlow song."
01:41:51;01:41:53;"- On the Jack Harlow Fergie song, yeah, yeah."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"He says, like, ""I'm on cloud."""
01:41:55;01:41:57;"- I think it's, ""I'm on Angus Cloud 9,"""
01:41:57;01:41:59;"or ""I'm on Angus Cloud number 9."""
01:41:59;01:42:01;"(laughing)"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Which is such a Drake lyric."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"Isn't that such a Drake line?"
01:42:04;01:42:04;"- Yes."
01:42:04;01:42:07;"- That's pure book of Drake right there."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"- And Drake produces ""Euphoria."""
01:42:08;01:42:10;"- It's full circle."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"- I'm sorry, hip hop."
01:42:11;01:42:13;"The countdown is now."
01:42:13;01:42:17;"In 15 years, a dude will be crushing a burrito,"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"talking to a young dude who's, like,"

01:42:26;01:42:27;"No, hip hop's like the most,"
01:42:27;01:42:30;"it's the relevant art form, the successor to rock."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"And they'll just be like,"

01:42:40;01:42:41;"- Yeah. - ""American Sniper."""

01:42:44;01:42:47;"in the grocery store, and he can't handle it"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"because he's just been at war, and he's like,"

01:42:55;01:42:57;"- ""American Sniper,"" I never saw it."
01:42:57;01:42:59;"- No, but the only--"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"- I'm sure it's a pretty common trope"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"for the guy who gets back from war."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"- And that Jeremy Renner movie"
01:43:04;01:43:08;"that also was a big awards movie,"
01:43:08;01:43:11;"he goes to a Costco and wigs out."
01:43:11;01:43:12;"- Hurt Locker. - Yeah, I feel like that also."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"- Hurt Locker. - In Hurt Locker."
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Maybe I'm getting you confused."

01:43:19;01:43:22;"yeah, Costco, and this song's playing,"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"and he picks up the Cheez-It,"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"and he just, that hip hop-age Cheez-It,"
01:43:27;01:43:30;"and listening to Jack Harlow on the speakers,"

01:43:42;01:43:46;"who looked exactly like Jack Harlow in 1993,"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"and then today, he hears a Jack Harlow song"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"and Googles him and sees a picture of him,"

01:57:30;01:57:34;"- I think of it as sort of a 70s high school thing."
01:57:34;01:57:38;"- And I guess according to Ray Stevens who made this song,"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"when this song came out,"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"there were already about 15 other novelty singles"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"about streaking out."
01:57:43;01:57:47;"And after his came out, there ended up being like 40."
