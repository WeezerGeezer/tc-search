00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis, back again. On this episode we talk about the Eagles in China, the"
00:10;00:24;"Burger King, Chicken, Seal, Beach Boys, TLC, and so much more. This is Time Crisis with"
00:24;00:31;"Ezra Koenig."
01:11;01:17;"Time Crisis, back again. The boys are back in town. Now I guess for the listeners it's only been two"
01:17;01:21;"weeks, but for us we used to banked up last week, so this is, it's been a while."
01:21;01:28;"Long time no. When I got on it sounds like, Jake, you were trying to remember if"
01:28;01:33;"you knew anything about that episode. Oh yeah, I have zero recollection of the"
01:33;01:37;"banked episode. I remember we talked about Neil Young. Yeah, there's some Neil Young talk."
01:37;01:42;"Jake, do you remember what your soul movie is? I don't even remember, no. What a"
01:42;01:47;"soul movie is? What is that? That's weird how little I remember. A soul movie, if I"
01:47;01:53;"recall correctly, is the movie that was number one at the box office on your"
01:53;01:58;"tenth birthday. Hmm. Seinfeld, is that correct? I mean, per Time Crisis, that's"
01:58;02:02;"the definition of a soul movie. Yeah, that's, that's how we did it. Do you even"
02:02;02:07;"remember having this conversation, Jake? Very vaguely. Somebody's soul movie was"
02:07;02:12;"Platoon. I remember that. Probably mine then. That kind of makes sense."
02:12;02:16;"'Cause that's like '87. Oh yeah, 'cause that's probably like '87, that sounds right. Yeah. It's fine that you don't"
02:16;02:20;"remember the episode, but just one thing that we uncovered is that there is a"
02:20;02:25;"mandate, similar to the vaccine mandate, that you have to watch your soul movie"
02:25;02:29;"by the end of this calendar year. And that comes straight from Joe Biden. Again,"
02:29;02:33;"doesn't matter if you forgot the episode, but Joe Biden said every American"
02:33;02:39;"citizen, vaccinated or unvaccinated, he honestly doesn't give a sh*t. Either way,"
02:39;02:42;"you have to watch your soul movie by the end of the year. So anyway, just make sure"
02:42;02:46;"you throw in Platoon sometime in the next four and a half months. I'm happy to do"
02:46;02:51;"that. You got a good one. That's your soul movie, brother. Brother, that's your soul"
02:51;02:57;"movie. Do you remember what year it was? It's wild to me how little I remember of"
02:57;03:00;"episodes. People will bring things up like, ""That bit on that show,"" and I'm just"
03:00;03:07;"like, ""I don't remember that at all."" What show? I do a show. I always tell people when"
03:07;03:12;"they ask me about doing Time Crisis, I said, ""Anything you do bi-weekly, it's just"
03:12;03:18;"like the subtlest imprint. It's just enough to forget it exists."" Well, but we also"
03:18;03:24;"taped that show, what, a good six, eight weeks ago? This one is particularly deep. All bets"
03:24;03:28;"are off. Any conversation I've had over a month ago is like, I'm unlikely to be able"
03:28;03:32;"to recall that. I really can't remember my soul movie. I feel like Nick's was Black"
03:32;03:39;"Rain. That is deep. The Michael Douglas movie. What was my soul movie? It was D2, The Mighty"
03:39;03:45;"Ducks. Oh, okay. I'll watch that by the end of the year. Listen, Jack, you got to watch"
03:45;03:49;"your soul movie. Okay, and same goes to anybody listening and anybody who missed last week's"
03:49;03:54;"episode or two weeks ago's episode. Just, again, you don't have to listen to it. Just"
03:54;03:57;"look up what the number one movie was on your 10th birthday. That's your soul movie. Joe"
03:57;04:02;"Biden says you have to watch it. It's more important than getting vaccinated. Just go,"
04:02;04:10;"go, go. Run. Do not walk. Live Nation AEG just announced that you can't go to any Goose"
04:10;04:17;"shows unless you've seen your soul movie and you can't fake the card. It's very official."
04:17;04:23;"They're gonna do like - you're gonna have to take a quiz. If you want to go see, shout"
04:23;04:27;"out to Goose. They just did a festival and I also just read that they're putting up their"
04:27;04:34;"first arena show in Connecticut. Oh, where? The Mohegan Sun Arena."
04:34;04:38;"Is that outdoors or indoors? That's a good question. I guess it's part of the whole Mohegan"
04:38;04:44;"Sun casino complex. But anyway, any Connecticut jam band heads, if you want to go to that"
04:44;04:48;"show, you need to see your soul movie."
04:48;04:54;"Bouncers at the venue are ready with questions, trivia questions about every conceivable film."
04:54;05:01;"I mean, they have the internet, you know, they just look up Mighty Ducks, part two,"
05:01;05:08;"D2, Mighty Ducks. They bring up the Wikipedia page. Mr. Koenig."
05:08;05:15;"When Emilio Estevez first met Kenan Thompson's character, what was he doing? And people say,"
05:15;05:19;"how is this feasible? How's this going to work? You can't control people like that."
05:19;05:23;"It infringes on our civil liberties. I've heard all the arguments, but here's the thing."
05:23;05:28;"With lightning fast internet, which they're going to have at most venues, each interrogation"
05:28;05:34;"session takes about a minute. They pull up the Wikipedia page. They look at the plot."
05:34;05:39;"They ask you a simple question. No big deal. Show them your driver's license. It's actually"
05:39;05:44;"really easy. And also, this is there's so many people who love to take this kind of"
05:44;05:49;"security job because imagine you're a big movie buff and somebody said to you, hey,"
05:49;05:54;"you want to make an extra 75 bucks this weekend? Well, what do I have to do? Ask a few hundred"
05:54;05:58;"Jam Band fans about their soul movie. Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to take"
05:58;06:04;"that job. So we have to we just hire, I don't know, two, three hundred people. We can organize"
06:04;06:10;"it well. Anyway, you're not going to like life if you haven't seen your soul movie."
06:10;06:14;"Let's put it that way. You're not going to have too much fun if you haven't seen if you"
06:14;06:25;"haven't seen your soul movie. All the way. I was bouncing like I. On the back of my spine."
06:25;06:53;"Where we go. In the corner of the. Games. Let's go. We got a jam packed show. I really"
06:53;06:58;"like you took the initiative and you booked the whole show. I booked the whole show tonight."
06:58;07:04;"This morning. Tonight. This morning. Local promoter Jake Longstreth booked the whole"
07:04;07:08;"show. That's right. We haven't had guests in a minute. I feel like. Yeah, not since"
07:08;07:14;"Bruce Hornsby. Oh, wow. Round two. No, probably some other people. But so we got Aaron from"
07:14;07:19;"Mountain Brews coming through and Richard Pictures and LA Takedown. And then we also"
07:19;07:26;"got some actor director writers. Yeah, we got some multi hyphenates. Carson Mell, novelist,"
07:26;07:36;"screenwriter, songwriter, director, actor, and then Al D. Music promoter, movie producer"
07:36;07:42;"and actor. And they made a movie together called Some of Our Stallions. Music promoter,"
07:42;07:46;"movie producer and actor. That's a pretty good one. I'm very intrigued. So we're going"
07:46;07:51;"to be talking to them shortly. I guess we got, I mean, we got a month's worth of stuff"
07:51;07:57;"to get through. I mean, first of all, rest in peace to Charlie Watts. That's a sad one."
07:57;08:02;"The one and only drummer of the Rolling Stones. Yeah, I guess he, Mick and Keith were the"
08:02;08:10;"only guys to play on all the records. Right. Yeah. Wow. The Three Amigos. Just a great"
08:10;08:16;"drummer with a light touch. Excellent feel. A dapper gentleman. And a dapper gentleman."
08:16;08:22;"I mean, a nice counterpoint to the wild rock and roll excess of Mick and Keith. I mean,"
08:22;08:27;"if he was also kind of like a Keith Moon, kind of John Bonham wild man."
08:27;08:33;"No, totally. Yeah. And he famously like wasn't as into partying as everybody else. And just"
08:33;08:39;"a mellow dude with a light touch. Everyone throw on side two of Tattoo You. Just vibe"
08:39;08:43;"out. Interesting call. You know, I actually, it went through my mind. I was like, oh, should"
08:43;08:46;"we make like a Charlie Watts playlist? And I was like, people just got to go listen to"
08:46;08:50;"whatever Rolling Stones they want. It's also he, because he wasn't a flashy drummer. It's"
08:50;08:54;"not like there's some songs where it's just like, oh dude, you know, there's no like when"
08:54;09:01;"the TV breaks. Or like, oh, there's a 10 minute solo. What's on side two of Tattoo You? Is"
09:01;09:07;"that with like Heaven? It's got worried about you. It's got take you to the top. It's got"
09:07;09:13;"waiting on a friend. Oh, beautiful song. It's just this like all five songs kind of just"
09:13;09:19;"like blend together in this really cool way. It's just like this chill kind of minimalist"
09:19;09:27;"vibe. It's a very kind of unique little palette that they touched on briefly. And I don't"
09:27;09:30;"know, that's my go to. If I'm throwing on stones, I'm throwing on side two of Tattoo"
09:30;09:36;"You. Side two? Because of side one has like, I don't need to hear start. Oh yeah, no, no,"
09:36;09:44;"it does have Heaven. I love that song. Is that really vibe one? Oh yeah. Like, kind"
09:44;09:49;"of like psychedelic, like 80s psychedelic. Oh yeah, that is a great side. Oh yeah. And"
09:49;09:53;"to end the album with waiting on a friend. Waiting on a friend is top five stones for"
09:53;09:57;"me. Yeah, because side one, there's a couple like kind of like boogie numbers that, you"
09:57;10:02;"know, I don't need, I don't need start me up. But like side two is just all like, they're"
10:02;10:08;"not ballads per se, but they're sort of this like kind of mid tempo, like chill minimalists"
10:08;10:15;"stone. It's like a weird period. A lot of people say that that was, that Tattoo You"
10:15;10:21;"was their last great album. Yeah. Although I think there is good stuff after there. Tattoo"
10:21;10:25;"You is maybe their last like just classic album that produced like a big hit single,"
10:25;10:31;"like start me up and also like cool songs. Yeah. I'm pretty into mixed emotions. Their"
10:31;10:36;"off steel wheels. Not familiar. All right, let's throw on mixed emotions. Mixed emotions"
10:36;10:54;"are like 89. That's a classic Watts groove right there. I was really into this when,"
10:54;11:00;"when this was a new single when I was a kid. Were you like seeing it on MTV? Yeah. Wow."
11:00;11:07;"I was like surprised with myself that I would like this new stone song. Chorus is just great."
11:07;11:36;"Kind of some rare harmonies for the stones. They don't really do like two part harmony"
11:36;11:41;"on a chorus very often. Keith comes in a lot on the chorus. Like, yeah, I feel like he"
11:41;11:47;"comes in to like give a little emphasis on like the third verse of the song or something."
11:47;12:12;"Yeah. That is just like straight up like two part on the chorus. I like this idea that"
12:12;12:17;"you were surprised that you were into a new stone single. Cause I feel like you would"
12:17;12:22;"have been 12 when this came out. So you're just like at the lunch table at like middle"
12:22;12:26;"school just be like, guys, call me crazy, but the new stone single is actually pretty"
12:26;12:31;"good. I know we haven't been getting a lot of like excellent work from any of the sixties"
12:31;12:35;"dudes. Certainly not since a Tattoo You, but I would say this is some of their best work"
12:35;12:41;"in years. You already had that kind of like just rock fan feeling. Yeah, no, I think like,"
12:41;12:44;"you know, in the late eighties I was sort of like, I knew who the stones were, but they"
12:44;12:50;"were a sixties band in my book. That's a sophisticated understanding for a 12 year old. I was like,"
12:50;12:56;"why would I like this? You know, it's like I was into like Motley Crue and like Def Leppard"
12:56;13:02;"and stuff. And I liked like Ruby Tuesday and some of the like sixties singles. I don't"
13:02;13:07;"think I really liked the like seventies stuff yet. That came later. Interesting. But just"
13:07;13:11;"from like either my parents record collection or just like the classic rock radio or the"
13:11;13:16;"oldies radio, I was into like their poppier sixties stuff. And I just remember being like,"
13:16;13:21;"yeah, I mean, these guys are old. Right. Why would I like this? I felt the same way when"
13:21;13:25;"in the nineties when people started loving those Bob Dylan records, like Time Out of"
13:25;13:32;"Mind. And I was like, I'm not going to listen to that. Yeah, but I'm just saying like, at"
13:32;13:36;"least by the nineties, you were like in your teens or twenties. I'm just saying you were"
13:36;13:42;"young to even have a conception of like, this is an old band putting out new material,"
13:42;13:46;"which is generally considered treacherous territory. And even though I'm into more of"
13:46;13:53;"the current wave of American hair metal, I do really respect. I'm just picturing like"
13:53;13:56;"a little 12 year old, like American psycho, just like, hey, dad, have you heard the new"
13:56;14:02;"Stone single? And he's like, what? You're just like, I got to say that it's some of"
14:02;14:07;"their best works in some girls. Now, yes, I am more interested in a lot of the music"
14:07;14:12;"coming out of LA or England at this point, or some of the English new wave. But I got"
14:12;14:16;"to say the stones hold their own. They're just a classic band. It's a back to basic"
14:16;14:21;"sound. Just like I think this is excellent work. Easily their best singles and start"
14:21;14:26;"me up. I got to say, dad, Mick kind of lost his way in the mid eighties. The attempted"
14:26;14:31;"solo career, the Harlem shuffle cover. I wasn't feeling it, but this proves that there's still"
14:31;14:35;"more gas in the tank with the stones. Best single since start me up. And you can quote"
14:35;14:41;"me on that. Anyway, I'm going to school. Have a good day at work."
14:41;14:48;"My dad just turns to my mom, we need to call a psychologist stat."
14:48;14:56;"Can I talk to you? Jake's really into like the new Stone single. That's very strange."
14:56;15:01;"Just a little more housekeeping on the TC text thread. We were remembered that during"
15:01;15:06;"pride month, Burger King made a big announcement that they were going to donate a bunch of"
15:06;15:12;"money to, I don't even remember Seinfeld. Remind me about this. What was the Burger"
15:12;15:17;"King? They had a new sandwich called the chicken and they were kind of trolling their biggest"
15:17;15:22;"competition Chick-fil-A, which is the biggest chicken sandwich in America because Chick-fil-A"
15:22;15:29;"notoriously in the past has given money to anti LGBT hate groups, even though they claim"
15:29;15:33;"they're done with it. A lot of people are skeptical. Chick-fil-A organization says that's"
15:33;15:37;"in the past. We don't mess with that stuff anymore, but people are skeptical. And Burger"
15:37;15:42;"King was sticking it to them saying, Hey, if you want to support a non homophobic chicken"
15:42;15:46;"sandwich, try the chick King. They put their money where their mouth was. They said they"
15:46;15:52;"were going to give, what was the promotion? Yeah. So on June 3rd of this year, a Burger"
15:52;16:00;"King tweeted the hashtag Chick King says LGBTQ plus rights during hashtag pride month, even"
16:00;16:06;"on Sundays. And then the eyes looking to the left emoji, your chicken sandwich craving"
16:06;16:12;"can do good. We are making a donation to HRC that's human rights campaign. Um, for every"
16:12;16:19;"King sold BK will contribute 40 cents to the human rights campaign brackets max donation"
16:19;16:25;"250 K. I forgot about that aspect that they made a little joke about even on Sundays."
16:25;16:29;"That's getting kind of spicy because I bet there probably are some Christian people who"
16:29;16:34;"say I don't like this anti LGBT bull, but I do respect the closed on Sundays elements."
16:34;16:41;"And now they're getting in the closed on Sundays thing. It would also, I'm also just picturing"
16:41;16:47;"an alternate universe where rather than get into the, uh, hate stuff, Burger King was"
16:47;16:51;"like, Hey, we got a new chicken sandwich and guess what? You can get it on Sundays."
16:51;16:55;"We're doing a promotion for the first month of the chick King for every chicken we sell."
16:55;17:02;"We're donating a dollar to the atheist foundation of America. Hashtag God isn't real. Like,"
17:02;17:08;"Whoa, shots fired from Burger King really coming for the, uh, Chick-fil-A organization,"
17:08;17:13;"Burger King on their social media announced that God isn't real. They're welcoming atheists"
17:13;17:18;"to come through and they're saying, please come on Sunday. It's just another day. Okay."
17:18;17:20;"Interesting move. I'm surprised that corporate approved that one."
17:20;17:25;"I mean, talk about false idols, right? Like Burger King is the new God. Essentially. I"
17:25;17:28;"feel like that's what they'd be. They'd be implying. I mean, Burger King is basically"
17:28;17:33;"saying that they're like the John Lennon of fast food. That's right. And even the Burger"
17:33;17:40;"King, this character, this guy with this giant head, this kind of hubristic, you know, what's"
17:40;17:45;"a burger? A burger is meat. So, essentially it's meat King. It's saying that the kind"
17:45;17:52;"of spiritual realm, the energetic spiritual realm, which is where the true King of the"
17:52;17:58;"universe resides, they're saying that doesn't exist. They're saying all that exists is in"
17:58;17:59;"meat, meat King."
17:59;18:04;"You think about Adam and Eve, garden of Eden, you know, God creating Eve out of the rib"
18:04;18:09;"of Adam. I feel like there's a parallel to be drawn from Burger King creating a new God"
18:09;18:12;"from the, from the meat of the land."
18:12;18:13;"Meat of a cow."
18:13;18:14;"The meat of a cow."
18:14;18:18;"Yeah, no, it's very good point. And they're also saying that by having this name, Burger"
18:18;18:24;"King, they're saying meat is all there is. They're saying that there's no soul. Essentially."
18:24;18:25;"The soul doesn't exist."
18:25;18:28;"The soul doesn't exist. We're just meat that moves around."
18:28;18:33;"Heavy stuff, guys. Heavy stuff. That would be funny if a fast food chain really did double"
18:33;18:35;"that, like just went that way."
18:35;18:36;"I mean, honestly,"
18:36;18:37;"We're all just meat."
18:37;18:43;"You have a human or a cow, you're just meat on a skeleton. That's all there is."
18:43;18:44;"You're a meat puppet."
18:44;18:52;"You're a meat puppet. The bolt goes into your brain, the lights go out, you're done."
18:52;18:59;"Cows have no souls and neither do you. They're taking on vegans, Chick-fil-A, organized religion"
18:59;19:02;"all at the same time. I don't buy it personally."
19:02;19:05;"That's an uphill battle from a marketing perspective."
19:05;19:10;"I mean, there's a lot of people there. They're rational materialists. They don't believe"
19:10;19:32;"in a soul. They believe we're all meat puppets. Okay."
19:32;19:37;"But anyway, so Burger King, they were doing a whole campaign. They're trying to take down"
19:37;19:41;"Chick-fil-A with the Chick-King. We talked about it a bunch and it kind of popped in"
19:41;19:46;"my head again. And I thought, I wonder how that went. And so Seinfeld, when we first"
19:46;19:50;"asked you to go check in on how many Chick-Kings were sold, how much money got donated, was"
19:50;19:52;"there anything in the media about it?"
19:52;19:57;"That was the frustrating part about it, that there was a lot of reporting on the initial"
19:57;20:05;"tweet and the offer and a lot of fanfare about Burger King, clapping back Chick-fil-A, giving"
20:05;20:10;"the money, all the right thing. And then now here we are at the end of August, a month"
20:10;20:16;"out from the end of Pride and not a single report. And I'm telling you, I scoured the"
20:16;20:22;"internet. I went 10 pages deep on Google. I'm talking like a deep scour here. And I"
20:22;20:28;"got to say, I got to hold these food publications to account because Bon Appetit, where were"
20:28;20:33;"you on this? Eater, right? Grub Street, Food Network, where were you on this where you"
20:33;20:39;"can just report on, anybody can say anything and then nobody's going to follow up. So I"
20:39;20:45;"don't want to get all righteous, but I feel like TC is really doing our due diligence"
20:45;20:46;"here."
20:46;20:50;"We might be the only news outfit on planet Earth who actually followed up about this."
20:50;20:56;"It seems that way. I don't want to ruin the end of the story, but it felt like when we"
20:56;21:01;"did make contact with the right people about this, it took a few days to formulate a statement."
21:01;21:05;"So I think this might be a TC exclusive, what we're about to reveal here."
21:05;21:09;"Okay. So you actually got in touch with Burger King PR?"
21:09;21:14;"I did. But I have to also say that I reached out initially to HRC because I thought who's"
21:14;21:19;"going to be the most honest or the most direct about this, but the recipient of -"
21:19;21:20;"Right, right."
21:20;21:25;"So I reached out to HRC, don't hear anything back. I actually called HRC a few times. Their"
21:25;21:32;"press phone number goes to a dial tone. And so that sort of went nowhere. So somebody"
21:32;21:37;"on the thread had the suggestion to go directly to the source, go to BK. And it took a few"
21:37;21:43;"days, but somebody in BK's sort of corporate comms department did respond. And the question"
21:43;21:50;"was, was the money from the Chaking Initiative actually donated to HRC? And I got an email"
21:50;21:55;"from someone named Molly at Burger King. And she said, ""See below for a statement from"
21:55;22:01;"Burger King."" The statement was, ""We are excited to share that the sales of the Chaking Sandwich"
22:01;22:08;"met the goal and the full 250K donation has been made to HRC on behalf of Burger King."""
22:08;22:16;"Well that's great. So first of all, congratulations to Burger King. Congratulations to all Chaking"
22:16;22:24;"eaters who helped raise this money and congratulations to HRC. But I guess, okay, so just to rewind,"
22:24;22:28;"I think it is a little bit crazy that we're the only news outfit that followed up on this"
22:28;22:34;"story. I guess that doesn't reflect poorly on Burger King, right? It more just goes to"
22:34;22:38;"show that the media, they make a big fuss about the announcement, but they don't want"
22:38;22:43;"to follow up and they think, ""All right, we already covered this once. Who cares that"
22:43;22:47;"they actually raised the money?"" Is that fair to say, Seinfeld? It's the media?"
22:47;22:53;"I would say so. I think it's also a little curious that neither Burger King nor the HRC"
22:53;22:59;"thought to issue... I mean, this seems like classic press release fodder, cause and effect."
22:59;23:06;"I'd love to know when that money was donated. I wonder if they were like, ""Oh, s***."""
23:06;23:07;"Interesting."
23:07;23:09;"""Honk Crisis is looking into this."""
23:09;23:12;"And that explains the sort of five day long lull between the..."
23:12;23:16;"Interesting. They were like, ""We got..."" Went up the flagpole like, ""Listen, we got Seinfeld"
23:16;23:20;"2000 breathing down our necks. Just cut the check."" And they're like, ""But we only sold"
23:20;23:25;"30 Chakings. Just cut the f***ing check."" All right? The guy in accounting is just like,"
23:25;23:30;"""I can't make the numbers work. The Chaking was a flop. I can't make the work."" And they're"
23:30;23:34;"just like, ""You f***ing take Whopper money. I don't care. Just cut the check."""
23:34;23:36;"Take the Whopper money."
23:36;23:41;"All right. He could... Yeah, we actually got to open up the books. Of course, I believe"
23:41;23:45;"that they donated the money, but I was actually, frankly, a little more curious about how many"
23:45;23:46;"Chakings they sold."
23:46;23:52;"Well, it's funny that you mentioned that because you brought that up and I did actually follow"
23:52;23:57;"up with a friend of the show, Molly, and I said, ""Well, okay, thank you."" And how many"
23:57;24:02;"Chakings were sold in the month? That was probably three, four days ago. No response."
24:02;24:05;"So I don't know if they're like, ""You're pushing your luck."" You're lucky that we even said"
24:05;24:10;"and acknowledged you. I don't know what the deal is or if we'll hear something after the"
24:10;24:17;"show is recorded. But we did some number crunching ourselves and we determined that at minimum,"
24:17;24:24;"BK sold 625,000 Chakings if the 40 cents... We multiplied the 40 cents."
24:24;24:26;"If they didn't use Whopper money."
24:26;24:29;"Right, exactly. If they weren't dipping into the Whopper account."
24:29;24:34;"Did they really sell 625,000? God, I have no concept of that. And by the way, shout"
24:34;24:39;"out to Molly. I know that you probably got a thankless job working in PR. I'm just visualizing"
24:39;24:46;"a scenario that's like the White House press room and it's like Jen Psaki is up there."
24:46;24:51;"She sees like Seinfeld and she just looks at you like you're Fox News and she's like,"
24:51;24:56;"""Oh my God."" And you're just like, ""Um, Jen, yeah, one question about the Chaking."" And"
24:56;25:01;"she was just like, ""We're dealing with Afghanistan. Please, no more questions about Chaking."""
25:01;25:04;"And just like all the other reporters just like groaning. You're like, ""Um, no, I think"
25:04;25:07;"the American people deserve to know."""
25:07;25:11;"I just want to say for me and my interest in this story, I never doubted that Burger"
25:11;25:16;"King is going to give 250 grand to HRC. That's chump change and they get to write that off"
25:16;25:21;"too. So I never doubted that Burger King wouldn't give the money. I really was just curious"
25:21;25:27;"about if they would actually sell enough Chakings to make that donation according to their own"
25:27;25:28;"rules."
25:28;25:35;"I just did a very cursory number crunch. There's about 18,000 Burger Kings globally. So to"
25:35;25:41;"sell 600,000 sandwiches, it's about a little less than 30 sandwiches per restaurant. Pretty"
25:41;25:42;"doable."
25:42;25:43;"Pretty reasonable."
25:43;25:44;"Pretty doable."
25:45;25:46;"Except this is probably a US only initiative."
25:46;25:51;"Okay. Well, it's probably, we can look at number of locations US. I'm going to guess"
25:51;25:52;"it's well over 10,000."
25:52;25:57;"I don't think they have Chakings at like Burger King in Germany."
25:57;26:02;"It looks like there are 7,200, 7,250 Burger King locations in the US."
26:02;26:05;"So they got to sell like what, 60 or 70 per location?"
26:05;26:07;"Yeah, that sounds right."
26:07;26:08;"In a month?"
26:08;26:09;"Two or three a day?"
26:09;26:10;"Yeah, come on."
26:10;26:12;"2.6 a day."
26:12;26:13;"Per location."
26:13;26:18;"You know what I would really love? I would just love to pick a random Burger King somewhere,"
26:18;26:23;"just like a Davenport, Iowa Burger King and just say, guys, just for that month, can we"
26:23;26:29;"just see the numbers? I just want to see a spreadsheet. Like a Davenport, Iowa Burger"
26:29;26:35;"King during Pride Month. Is there a day where they sell zero Chakings or they pump, they"
26:35;26:40;"do like 10 a day? I'm just curious, like a new product. Obviously there are lots of Whoppers,"
26:40;26:45;"lots of fries, but they sell a lot at the beginning of the month. And then it kind of,"
26:45;26:49;"the enthusiasm wanes because the word of mouth wasn't good. I just want to know that kind"
26:49;26:50;"of stuff."
26:50;26:53;"I could see that. Week one, hot out of the gates."
26:53;26:58;"If anybody listening works at a Burger King, we'd love some just, you know, anecdotal evidence"
26:58;27:02;"of like, what was that month like? Was it crazy? Were you getting slammed with Chaking"
27:02;27:08;"requests throughout? Was there a buzz at the location? But anyway, thank you. Thank you"
27:08;27:13;"to Burger King for your transparency. If you could follow up with answering the other questions,"
27:13;27:17;"we'd love just to know the raw numbers. But anyway, good for you donating the money to"
27:17;27:18;"the HRC."
27:18;27:31;"Close on Sunday. You my Chick-fil-A. Close on Sunday. You my Chick-fil-A. Hold the selfies."
27:31;27:41;"Put the gram away. Get your family. Y'all hold hands and pray. When you got daughters,"
27:41;27:51;"always keep them safe. Watch out for vipers. Don't let them indoctrinate. Close on Sunday."
27:51;28:01;"You my Chick-fil-A. You're my number one. With the lemonade. Raise our sons. Train them in"
28:01;28:13;"the faith. Do temptations. Make sure they're wide away. Follow Jesus. Listen and obey."
28:13;28:17;"No more living for the culture. We nobody's slave."
28:17;28:23;"Okay, so the new movie, Jake, I gotta admit, I haven't seen the movie yet. I saw the trailer."
28:23;28:25;"It looks excellent. Jake, have you seen the film?"
28:25;28:26;"I've seen it twice."
28:26;28:27;"Whoa."
28:27;28:29;"It's called Some of Our Stallions."
28:29;28:30;"And what's the basic?"
28:30;28:35;"Well, it's kind of a two-hander. It stars Carson Mel and Al D., who will be joining"
28:35;28:42;"us shortly. They have just been released from an involuntary stint at a menstal hospital"
28:42;28:47;"and they're best friends. Their doctor is played by a friend of the show, Tim Heidecker."
28:47;28:48;"Excellent."
28:48;28:52;"And they try to go out in the world and find their way. Well, we should let them maybe"
28:52;28:53;"describe it."
28:53;28:54;"Okay, let's get them on the horn."
28:54;28:55;"All right."
28:55;29:00;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:00;29:01;"Hello."
29:02;29:07;"Carson, Al, welcome to Time Crisis."
29:07;29:12;"Yeah, thank you for having us. Very lucky to be on this show with all my favorite people."
29:12;29:18;"Oh, we're very happy to have you. So first of all, this is truly a time crisis. We got"
29:18;29:23;"all sorts of time zones represented on this episode. Carson, where are you?"
29:23;29:24;"I'm in Los Angeles."
29:24;29:28;"Okay. So you're on Pacific time. And Al, where are you?"
29:28;29:35;"I'm in mysterious Asian country, Beijing. So I have to drink beer because it's our culture."
29:35;29:39;"We have to drink a beer after 12 o'clock. It's our religion."
29:39;29:41;"After which 12 o'clock? Midnight?"
29:41;29:48;"Midnight. So after midnight, 12 o'clock, we have to drink a beer. It's our religion."
29:48;29:49;"Is that a real thing?"
29:49;29:51;"It's beer o'clock over there."
29:51;29:53;"Oh, yeah. Nice."
29:53;29:57;"Wait, but so how does that work? As soon as the clock strikes midnight, if you're up,"
29:57;29:58;"you're grabbing a brew?"
29:58;29:59;"Yeah. IPA."
29:59;30:00;"Even children, right?"
30:00;30:01;"Yes."
30:01;30:02;"Little kid beers."
30:02;30:08;"Oh, that's a good idea for a Mountain Brews album. Midnight Brews. It's kind of like your"
30:08;30:11;"slick LA kind of album."
30:11;30:13;"Right, right. Kind of mid 80s."
30:13;30:18;"It's the remix album. It's like the Dua Lipa remix album."
30:18;30:23;"It's all house remixes of Mountain Brews. Let's get a little background for our listeners"
30:23;30:30;"about both you guys because you're both multi hyphenates. So, Carson, you act and directed"
30:30;30:32;"the film and wrote it?"
30:32;30:34;"Yes, and edited it also."
30:34;30:39;"Just to give the listeners some more of your background, you've written on a bunch of TV"
30:39;30:44;"shows, made the great cartoon. Give us your CV real quick."
30:44;30:51;"Yeah, I'm mostly a writer and that landed me in TV so I could make a living. But I've"
30:51;30:59;"self-published a bunch of novels for the last 15, 16 years. I put out three. I actually"
30:59;31:06;"have one novel on Audible that's only an audio novel. You can't read it, not yet at least."
31:06;31:13;"Yeah, so just mostly a writer and then I act out of convenience. When I was making my cartoons"
31:13;31:18;"and stuff, it was easier to just do the voices than call people or try to track down actors."
31:18;31:22;"So that's how I started acting. It's become part of what I do."
31:22;31:28;"And so Al, you're a movie producer, music promoter and actor?"
31:28;31:31;"Yes. Also, I'm a lover. I'm a sensei. I'm a lover."
31:31;31:35;"All right. I'd love to hear that. So what's your story, man?"
31:35;31:41;"Wait, Al, have you brought the Eagles over to China? This is one thing I wanted to ask"
31:41;31:42;"you about."
31:42;31:44;"Correct. That's correct."
31:44;31:46;"You brought the band, the Eagles, to China?"
31:46;31:54;"Yes. After Eagles, I did Bob Dylan. I did the Eagles in March 2011 and then I did Bob"
31:54;31:55;"Dylan April 2011."
31:55;31:58;"Wow. You brought Bob Dylan to China?"
31:58;32:00;"Yeah, after Eagles."
32:00;32:03;"Okay. So what are these shows like? Are these like giant shows?"
32:03;32:04;"Yeah, it's all..."
32:04;32:07;"Club shows? Just getting some word of mouth out there?"
32:07;32:14;"No, back then, it was very legendary shows. We did an arena show. 10,000 people. 10,000"
32:14;32:22;"people seat. It was a big media... It was one of the most legendary tours in China."
32:22;32:27;"We were very lucky to receive all these big legendary American band, American legendary"
32:27;32:31;"musicians to China to perform with us. It was a very good moment."
32:31;32:32;"Okay."
32:32;32:36;"This is the one music really connected people. Music really connected people from different"
32:36;32:41;"backgrounds, different religions, different cultures to become one."
32:41;32:45;"And are those artists like the Eagles and Bob Dylan well known in China? These were"
32:45;32:47;"their first shows ever there, right?"
32:47;32:52;"Yeah. I mean, of course, not like everyone knows who is Bob Dylan, who is the Eagles,"
32:52;32:58;"but the people who got Western music education, people who grew up with the Western music"
32:58;33:02;"education, who listen to rock and roll, all know who they are."
33:02;33:07;"Let's back up a little bit. Has your main job been a music promoter for a long time?"
33:07;33:11;"How did you end up doing such like a giant shows?"
33:11;33:15;"Actually, I'm one of the people who listen to rock and roll grow up. I'm a one of the"
33:15;33:24;"rock kid. So I become a guitar player. I play a bunch of heavy metal band. But slowly, you"
33:24;33:28;"know, one player rock and roll band, nobody take me seriously. People think, oh, Audi"
33:28;33:34;"is crazy, Audi is madness, Audi don't work hard. I was like, how can I prove myself to"
33:34;33:40;"hard working people? So I got a job in Universal Music for a couple of years. But I hated the"
33:40;33:46;"people I work with at Universal Music. A bunch of money serious. No, no money serious. So"
33:46;33:51;"I decided to work with the people who I love. So I work, I become a concert promoters."
33:51;33:52;"Wow."
33:52;33:57;"Whoa. Okay. So you were, you were in a heavy metal band, you get a job at Universal and"
33:57;34:01;"they're making you work on pop music. Although, Al, I have heard that Miley actually loves"
34:01;34:05;"rock music too. And she's had a harder rock sound on some of her recent work. So I'd encourage"
34:05;34:06;"you to check it out."
34:06;34:07;"So you, I will."
34:07;34:11;"You might have more in common with Miley than you think. But okay. So, so yeah, you didn't"
34:11;34:15;"enjoy working at a label. So you got into promotion. So what kind of shows are you putting"
34:15;34:18;"on before you made it to Eagles and Bob Dylan status?"
34:18;34:25;"I did a bunch of like a black rebel motorcycle club and Jesus and Mary Jane, the Raven Lance,"
34:25;34:32;"the Cocoa Rosie, a bunch of like, like a bunch of, a lot of indie rock, the secret machines,"
34:32;34:37;"the killing jokes, a lot of indie band until I, I decided to do Eagles and Bob Dylan."
34:37;34:42;"Okay. So it sounds like your taste, you were in a metal band, then you're bringing over"
34:42;34:46;"black rebel motorcycle club, Jesus and Mary Jane. You like the kind of heavier stuff and"
34:46;34:47;"the darker stuff."
34:47;34:48;"Yeah."
34:48;34:51;"Did you always like the Eagles or did you actually hit a certain age and you're like,"
34:51;34:55;"you know what, the Eagles are all right. Cause I feel like a lot of heavy metal dudes wouldn't"
34:55;34:56;"admit that they liked the Eagles."
34:56;35:00;"I have a sentimental heart. I love this song. I can tell you why."
35:00;35:03;"Oh yeah. That's a great song."
35:03;35:09;"I tried to bring your band to China a couple of times, but really I tried to so hard to"
35:09;35:10;"bring your band to China."
35:10;35:11;"What, Vampire Weekend?"
35:11;35:17;"Yeah. I tried a couple of times. Yeah. Your band has huge following here."
35:17;35:20;"Okay. Have you been to China Ezra? Has the band played there?"
35:20;35:28;"No, I've never been to China. I kind of remember once we got an offer for a festival, but the"
35:28;35:31;"timing didn't work out, but maybe next year."
35:31;35:33;"Yes. Hopefully next year."
35:33;35:37;"All right. Well, now that we know each other, please send another offer."
35:37;35:40;"I will send you an offer, you'll come refuse."
35:40;35:41;"Okay. Excellent."
35:41;35:54;"We took a vow in summertime, now we find ourselves in late December. I believe that"
35:54;36:02;"New Year's Eve will be the perfect time for their great surrender, but they don't remember."
36:02;36:22;"We're going to be in the middle of the night. We're going to be in the middle of the night."
36:22;36:51;"We're going to be in the middle of the night."
36:51;37:07;"Okay. So then, now we got both of your backstories. How do you guys meet and end up making a movie"
37:07;37:08;"together?"
37:08;37:18;"We met through my manager who basically said, ""I met a cool financier and you guys should"
37:18;37:23;"get lunch together."" It was kind of that simple. Then we were working on trying to put some"
37:23;37:30;"bigger movie together. You always need a celebrity for a bigger movie to unlock the cash, so"
37:30;37:37;"that people aren't scared. I still am not really good at that, attracting a celebrity."
37:37;37:43;"I think part of it is I have a short list of celebrities I like, and I find most of"
37:43;37:48;"them not compelling enough to want to work with or look at."
37:48;37:56;"So anyway, we were in this process of waiting for people to read our script for this other"
37:56;38:01;"movie. Then Al asked me if I had a smaller movie that we could make in the meantime that"
38:01;38:07;"we could both act in together. He knew I acted, and it was one of those funny things where"
38:07;38:13;"the idea of your financier saying they want to be in the movie would usually be something"
38:13;38:20;"you don't do. I'm sure you're already sensing that Al has so much charisma. So I was like,"
38:20;38:24;"""Well, if I can bottle that lightning, it'll work."""
38:24;38:28;"As long as he doesn't get scared in front of the camera and clam up. If he can just"
38:28;38:35;"be himself and remain confident and just let his personality shine, then we'll have something"
38:35;38:43;"worth watching. So I was into it, and we spent a couple of years then making the movie."
38:43;38:47;"It's interesting hearing a little bit about Al's life because a lot of that is in his"
38:47;38:55;"character in the movie. His character is describing how he grew up in China and that he felt alienated"
38:55;38:59;"from his friends because no one understood the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers."
38:59;39:04;"And he came over to America, he started weeping because everyone was just listening to EDM."
39:04;39:06;"Isn't that part of the dialogue, Al?"
39:06;39:12;"Yeah, that's from the heart. But it's funny, Jake. You also have a Grateful Dead cover"
39:12;39:14;"band, right?"
39:14;39:18;"You're right. So that really piqued my interest when your character starts talking about the"
39:18;39:19;"dead."
39:19;39:20;"Wait, Al, are you a deadhead?"
39:20;39:21;"He's a deadhead. He's a deadhead."
39:21;39:22;"Yes. Yeah."
39:22;39:26;"So there are very few deadheads in China where you grew up?"
39:26;39:32;"Actually, it is. There's so many people listen to them, but that's the funny thing. A lot"
39:32;39:38;"of Western bands, maybe including you, like Vampire Awakened, have so many fans in China."
39:38;39:43;"But maybe you guys don't think about this, but actually, when you guys have very good"
39:43;39:49;"music, very good performance, your music can spread to other sides of the world easily."
39:49;39:53;"So that's why music is so magical. You don't need the media, you don't need the record"
39:53;39:59;"label. Your music can naturally connect you to people from other sides of the world."
39:59;40:03;"And that's a really beautiful thing when that happens. So this part of the movie that Jake's"
40:03;40:08;"talking about, was that your real experience? That you loved American rock music like the"
40:08;40:12;"Grateful Dead and the Almonds, and then when you came to the US, everybody was listening"
40:12;40:16;"to EDM and it made you sad? Is that true? Or is that kind of like you played it up for"
40:16;40:17;"the movie?"
40:17;40:22;"Half and half. I mean, I'm a big rock and roll fan. I listen to the Canadian progressive"
40:22;40:27;"band called Rush. I mean, in China, nobody around me listens to Rush, all these bands."
40:27;40:32;"I'm young American, all my friends in Los Angeles, nobody listens to Rush, nobody listens"
40:32;40:39;"to Grateful Dead. Everybody just listens to Radiohead."
40:39;40:44;"Listen, I like Radiohead, but anybody who loves Radiohead but doesn't respect Rush is"
40:44;40:48;"a real ass****. They need to open a history book."
40:48;40:53;"I've been listening to Eddie Money lately. You guys listening to Eddie Money at all?"
40:53;40:56;"A classic American rocker."
40:56;40:58;"Yeah. He's great."
40:58;40:59;"Hell yeah."
40:59;41:03;"One thing is for sure, I've never been to China, I don't know that much about it, but"
41:03;41:10;"I've always said that the place where rock is really still alive in this world is Mexico"
41:10;41:16;"and other countries in Latin America. In Mexico, when you see some of the size venues that"
41:16;41:22;"some older rockers come play, people are still flying the flag for rock and roll music and"
41:22;41:28;"it's really cool. Obviously, Mexico is a beautiful country. But yeah, America is no longer the"
41:28;41:34;"rock country. That's okay. Things change. But that means that the rock nation is international"
41:34;41:40;"and it's people like Jake, Al, all over the world who keep the rock flag flying."
41:40;41:45;"Doesn't matter where you're from because the world to a large extent has turned its back"
41:45;41:52;"on rock music. So anybody who's listened to rock music anywhere is part of a fraternity."
41:52;41:58;"The world of rock."
41:58;41:59;"The rock frat."
41:59;42:28;"I'm on the day you worry of mean, mean stride. Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride. Well, his mind is not for rent. Don't put him down his air again. He'll preserve a quiet defense, lighting out the day's events."
42:28;42:33;"Wait, so I'm just missing one part of the story, though. When did you become a film"
42:33;42:34;"financier?"
42:34;42:40;"So when I was booking for music festivals in China, because Vampire Awakens was busy."
42:40;42:47;"I was like, ""Oh, I need to work with somebody else."" So I brought this American band from"
42:47;42:53;"Los Angeles called Rooney. So I brought Rooney to China. So the frontman of Rooney called"
42:53;42:59;"Robert Schwartzman. He's a younger brother of Jason Schwartzman, the cousin of Soviet"
42:59;43:04;"Coppola. And then, yeah, so I became a very good friend of Robert Schwartzman. So after"
43:04;43:09;"we became very good friends, one day Robert is like, ""LD, I'm going to direct my first"
43:09;43:16;"movie. You should produce with me."" And that's the moment I set up my foot in Hollywood,"
43:16;43:22;"become a movie producer with Robert Schwartzman. And then I produced two movies for Robert."
43:22;43:28;"Wow. Okay, so it was music brought you to the film world via Robert Schwartzman."
43:28;43:29;"Yes."
43:29;43:32;"So Al, is this the first acting you've ever done?"
43:32;43:38;"Yes. I'm really a first time actor in this movie with the cast. So I'm very lucky to"
43:38;43:44;"be in a movie with my very, very, very good friends. So I feel in my comfortable zone."
43:44;43:45;"I feel very relaxed."
43:45;43:49;"Dude, you're very natural. You're very good in the movie, Al."
43:49;43:53;"Thank you, because I'm very comfortable with Carson and Olivia."
43:53;43:58;"We did the old trick of rehearsing it endlessly."
43:58;43:59;"Oh, wow."
43:59;44:03;"Probably rehearsed every scene 60 times, 70 times."
44:03;44:04;"Oh, wow."
44:04;44:09;"Because we were living together, so every night we got home, we'd rehearse. And almost"
44:09;44:13;"all of it's scripted. I know it's... Hopefully, it seems like it's not, but it is."
44:13;44:20;"Yeah, it doesn't seem scripted. In a cool way, it feels kind of loose."
44:20;44:27;"Yeah, my friend Graham, he's a writer on Silicon Valley with me. And he had this theory that"
44:27;44:33;"if you rehearse something zero times, it can be good. And then if you rehearse it five"
44:33;44:39;"times, it's going to be bad. And then if you rehearse it 70 times, you can make it now"
44:39;44:41;"feel normal or natural."
44:41;44:42;"Interesting."
44:42;44:44;"So, I had that in my head."
44:44;44:45;"Horseshoe theory."
44:45;44:48;"I like that. Yeah, it's the shape of it, I guess."
44:48;44:52;"Or a bell curve. I think that's like a bunch of things that the extremes have something"
44:52;44:55;"in common. Yeah, horseshoe theory is that the extremes politically bend towards each"
44:55;44:56;"other."
44:56;44:57;"Yeah, that makes sense."
44:57;45:01;"Same as like zero and 100 times of doing something."
45:01;45:07;"Man, I can't wait to see this movie. Carson, what's the best way for people to watch it?"
45:07;45:10;"I bought it on my Apple TV because I'm a company man."
45:10;45:11;"There you go."
45:11;45:13;"This is an Apple program that we're on."
45:13;45:15;"It's right there."
45:15;45:19;"So, how long were you in the US, Al, when you guys were living together and rehearsing"
45:19;45:21;"and shooting the movie?"
45:21;45:22;"It was 10 days."
45:22;45:29;"Oh, well, sorry, just because we shot it in Canada, but Al came and lived with me for"
45:29;45:31;"10 days too, where we practiced."
45:31;45:35;"And then you rolled up to Canada to shoot. So, it sounds like, Al, you've been to the"
45:35;45:41;"US many times. And so, we heard that anecdote that's in the movie about being a little depressed"
45:41;45:48;"at the EDMification of the US. But generally, what have your impressions been spending time"
45:48;45:49;"in the US?"
45:49;45:56;"It's very great. Also, it's not just me, also my other friends, everybody wants."
45:56;46:04;"The flight, the plane, arrived American, Los Angeles. When we walk out, you see, ""Welcome"
46:04;46:09;"to Los Angeles,"" the mayor of Los Angeles. ""Welcome to Los Angeles."" We always head"
46:09;46:15;"down, we always take our hat. ""You are welcome. We are happy to be in Los Angeles."""
46:15;46:19;"And then once we walk out from the customs gate, you know, it's funny, people say, ""Oh,"
46:19;46:25;"Los Angeles, the air is so no good. It's polluted. It's California air. It would be great for"
46:25;46:30;"you living in California, Los Angeles."" That's the wonderful, all the palm trees, the taco,"
46:30;46:37;"the people, beautiful people. It's a great freedom. It's just a catchy vibe."
46:37;46:42;"You're making me kind of excited about going back to Los Angeles. Have you ever done a"
46:42;46:47;"deep American road trip? Have you ever been to Texas, Midwest, South?"
46:47;46:53;"I only did the road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco. It was beautiful. The ocean"
46:53;46:55;"was really beautiful."
46:55;46:57;"So you've really seen California?"
46:57;47:00;"Yeah, Seattle, all these beautiful countries."
47:00;47:04;"Okay, all right. Yeah. So yeah, you've seen the whole West Coast. All right. Well, there's"
47:04;47:09;"a lot more to love. Next time you come to the US, you got to give us another report."
47:09;47:13;"What's the live music scene like in China right now? Or at least where you are?"
47:13;47:19;"It's the same as America and other countries. That's the same. Because rock and roll, also"
47:19;47:25;"the pop music, pop music, rock and roll, jazz, blues, all from Western countries. So from"
47:25;47:30;"the West, it's all, I don't know how to say the proper word. It's like a copycat. It's"
47:30;47:35;"not from this. It's not from our culture. So I think the rock and roll here, the blues,"
47:35;47:41;"jazz, we have to learn from the Western countries. So it's, of course, it's as good as Western"
47:41;47:47;"rock and roll. But at this moment, because nobody can do international touring. So people"
47:47;47:53;"for me, I have this international ears. I have to put up with all the **** band. At"
47:53;47:58;"this moment, my ears have to just listen to some not very great musicians play music. I"
47:58;48:04;"can't wait. One day, the gate open. Everybody can do international travel. I can listen"
48:04;48:09;"to some very, very good musicians do live music again."
48:09;48:14;"Are there indoor shows happening? Because in the US, it seems like I can't make heads"
48:14;48:18;"or tails of it. Tours are getting pushed or canceled. Then you see pictures of some packed"
48:18;48:24;"club. I just don't know what's going on. But is it basically like a post-COVID music scene"
48:24;48:25;"now?"
48:25;48:30;"Yeah, but we have to do social distance. Also, when we go to a live show, like a club shows,"
48:30;48:36;"we have to wear a mask. All these scenes. It's a kind of sadness because that's the"
48:36;48:43;"beauty of seeing live music. Everybody laughing. Everybody have this exciting face. But at"
48:43;48:49;"this moment, everybody wear a mask. It's happiness, but also feel a little bit of sadness because"
48:49;48:52;"of the mask. But it's important to wear a mask."
48:52;48:58;"Right. Yeah. Kind of between a rock and a hard place on that one. Well, it seems like"
48:58;49:05;"you're a little bit harsh on the Chinese rock scene. But is there any bright lights that"
49:05;49:09;"you're excited about of Chinese rock bands?"
49:09;49:14;"Maybe a little bit. But that's the thing, man. This rock and roll culture is not from"
49:14;49:19;"here. It's really from Western countries. So no matter how great we are, we still have"
49:19;49:24;"missing something. It's like we have Chinese medicine. It's from our country. We have a"
49:24;49:29;"Chinese opera. No matter how hard, how many efforts, Western people try to sing very good"
49:29;49:34;"Chinese opera, doing Chinese medicine, Chinese martial arts. But still, you guys missing"
49:34;49:38;"something. I think this kind of thing, rock and roll, is really in Western cultures a"
49:38;49:43;"it's tough times for rock and Western culture. So I think you got to be more optimistic."
49:43;49:46;"We need a Chinese rock band to save rock."
49:46;49:51;"Okay, I will quit my movie career. I will go back to play heavy metal."
49:51;49:55;"You might have to be the one. Well, thanks so much, guys. I really I can't wait to see"
49:55;49:56;"the movie."
49:56;49:58;"And yeah, there's a lot of heart in the movie."
49:58;50:03;"Yeah, it's very the character. It was when once Al D signed up to play Andy, I rewrote"
50:03;50:05;"the whole script with him in mind."
50:05;50:08;"Oh, wow. I can see that."
50:08;50:10;"There was even a guitar part that I cut out."
50:10;50:11;"Oh, man."
50:11;50:16;"We had a scene like it was sort of a montage of Al D playing guitar and then the characters"
50:16;50:21;"dancing and it was feeling really like an indie movie and not in a good way."
50:21;50:22;"Right."
50:22;50:26;"So I had to cut it out. But it was an impressive performance."
50:26;50:30;"Yeah, it's funny. I like this movie a lot. It is a small movie, but it does not have"
50:30;50:36;"the aspirational charms of many a Sundance film. It's a little blue."
50:36;50:41;"A little. Yeah, it's just, you know, they're trying to get by. I feel like if these characters"
50:41;50:44;"can survive, that's their success."
50:44;50:47;"So, yeah, it ain't easy for everybody, you know."
50:47;50:51;"Well, and I was going to say also, listeners of the show are familiar with The Long Dumb"
50:51;50:56;"Road, which you co-wrote. And I would say that the character that you play, Carson,"
50:56;51:02;"is reminiscent of the Manzuka's character, Richard, but with kind of a lot more edge."
51:02;51:07;"Yeah, I'd say that's a fair assessment of it."
51:07;51:12;"Yeah. Richard never really feels dangerous in The Long Dumb Road, whereas your character,"
51:12;51:18;"Beautiful Bill, has a lot of the same kind of philosophical outlooks as Richard, but"
51:18;51:22;"is just unhinged, shall we say?"
51:22;51:27;"Yeah, yeah. I like movies where it feels like people might get hurt at any moment, you know"
51:27;51:33;"what I mean? I think that's what I was trying to get with that guy, so I'm glad you say that."
51:33;51:38;"You gotta see some of our stallions before the end of the summer. That's a Joe Biden mandate."
51:38;51:40;"(Laughter)"
51:40;51:42;"You gotta see some of our stallions."
51:42;51:45;"You gotta see some of our stallions. You're not going to be able to get into restaurants"
51:45;51:50;"if you haven't seen it. Just on the topic of rock and roll, just because of the week"
51:50;51:55;"that we're in, as we end this, anybody want to say anything about Charlie Watts, legendary"
51:55;51:59;"drummer of the Rolling Stones, who passed away at age 80 this week?"
51:59;52:01;"Long D for rock and roll."
52:01;52:02;"Yep."
52:02;52:05;"Hell yeah. Maybe that's the right note to end on."
52:05;52:07;"(Laughter)"
52:07;52:08;"I feel that."
52:08;52:11;"Well, thanks so much, guys. Yeah, everybody see the movie, and I hope you guys come back"
52:11;52:13;"soon, and I hope we all can hang out sometime."
52:13;52:16;"Yeah, thanks for letting us talk about it. I'm glad you--"
52:16;52:17;"Oh, absolutely."
52:17;52:22;"I'm glad you-- I never knew all that about Albee's rock and roll career, so it was good"
52:22;52:23;"to hear."
52:23;52:24;"Fascinating lives."
52:24;52:27;"You know, Carson and me, we only talk about love all the time."
52:27;52:30;"(Laughter)"
52:30;52:32;"Love talks."
52:32;52:34;"All right, guys, see you later."
52:34;52:36;"All right, thanks so much, guys. Have a good one."
52:36;52:37;"Thank you guys so much."
52:37;52:38;"Peace."
52:39;52:40;"Bye-bye."
52:40;52:41;"Bye."
52:46;52:51;"Tearing our love apart"
52:51;53:00;"Aren't we the same, two people who lived through years in the dark?"
53:00;53:04;"Oh, oh"
53:04;53:09;"Every time I try to walk away"
53:09;53:14;"Something makes me turn around and stay"
53:14;53:19;"And I can't tell you why"
53:19;53:26;"So, just real quick before we move on to our next guest out of the Longstreeth Rolodex,"
53:26;53:27;"hot off the presses."
53:27;53:28;"Yeah."
53:28;53:35;"Just now, the press release has come out saying that Mountain Dew has partnered with Flamin'"
53:35;53:39;"Hot Cheetos to make a Flamin' Hot Mountain Dew."
53:39;53:40;"(Laughter)"
53:40;53:43;"Oh, my God."
53:43;53:44;"That sounds real nasty."
53:44;53:48;"Just like all the other Flamin' Hot combos."
53:48;53:50;"They all sound disgusting."
53:50;53:52;"This is what the press release says."
53:52;53:54;"This is a great use of language."
53:54;53:57;"This is one of our most provocative beverages yet."
53:57;54:03;"And we're excited for Doonation and for Doonation to taste the unique blend of spicy and classy"
54:03;54:06;"sweet and crisp flavor of Mountain Dew."
54:06;54:09;"I just say provocative and Doonation."
54:09;54:11;"Sorry, guys, but nothing's shocking at this point."
54:11;54:12;"Right."
54:12;54:15;"I mean, this is one of those things where it's just like, if you told me they already"
54:15;54:18;"did it, I'd be like, ""Oh, I guess we missed that one."""
54:18;54:19;"Yeah."
54:19;54:23;"It's just like, we just kind of live in a world where nothing's special."
54:23;54:26;"So, it's, you know, somebody, anything you could think of."
54:26;54:29;"If somebody, are there Flamin' Hot Twinkies?"
54:29;54:33;"Is there Mountain Dew flavored (beep) shredded wheat?"
54:33;54:34;"Probably."
54:34;54:35;"Also, it's a soda."
54:35;54:36;"With a looking glass."
54:36;54:38;"I don't want provocative."
54:38;54:40;"I'm just trying to crack a can of soda."
54:40;54:42;"This isn't like a Lars Van Trier movie."
54:42;54:45;"I don't need provocative."
54:45;54:51;"Doesn't it feel like we're like two years from, do you remember Nathan Fielder's excrement"
54:51;54:52;"flavored frozen yogurt?"
54:52;54:53;"Oh, yeah."
54:53;54:54;"The poo flavored fro-yo."
54:54;54:57;"I feel like that's like on the horizon."
54:57;55:00;"Like that's like going to be prophetic at this point."
55:00;55:01;"Oh, totally."
55:01;55:05;"This also linked, we talked about the Mountain Dew alcoholic beverage, right?"
55:05;55:07;"Is it called Mountain Brew?"
55:07;55:09;"No, but the title of the-"
55:09;55:10;"Lawsuit."
55:10;55:13;"Brew the Dew is the sort of tagline."
55:13;55:14;"Is the Mountain Dew beer?"
55:14;55:15;"Yeah."
55:15;55:16;"Or Mountain Dew-"
55:16;55:18;"It's a hard, is it a hard seltzer?"
55:18;55:22;"I mean, I just assume they infused alcohol into the gross-"
55:22;55:23;"Into Mountain?"
55:23;55:24;"Yeah."
55:24;55:25;"Drink."
55:25;55:28;"It's hard Mountain Dew, Mountain spelled MTN."
55:28;55:31;"No caffeine, 5% alcohol."
55:31;55:34;"I'll also say like for this one, I mean-"
55:34;55:35;"Which market?"
55:35;55:39;"Not that I'm into the design of it, but you know, since we talk about the sort of"
55:39;55:42;"beverage bottle design, I guess I'd have to send it to you."
55:42;55:46;"I'm sort of into it in that it feels like really dark."
55:46;55:50;"Like it feels like, not like abject, but like it is sort of like,"
55:50;55:53;"I think I brought up on the show, remember Harley Davidson cigarettes?"
55:53;55:56;"When I was growing up, that was like, they were amazing."
55:56;55:57;"Harley Davidson cigarettes?"
55:57;55:58;"I don't remember those."
55:58;55:59;"There was a kid-"
55:59;56:01;"Wait, how did this never come up on the show before?"
56:01;56:02;"I thought I had."
56:02;56:06;"So when I was in high school, Harley Davidson released cigarettes."
56:06;56:08;"So this is going to be sort of mid-90s."
56:08;56:12;"And I remember there was this one kid, Anand Singh,"
56:12;56:14;"and he smoked Harley Davidson."
56:14;56:17;"He was on the debate team and he smoked Harley Davidson cigarettes."
56:17;56:19;"And he was a very small guy."
56:19;56:22;"But I just remember he'd pull out like, it was already sort of like"
56:22;56:26;"badass enough that he smoked and sort of out of character enough that he smoked,"
56:26;56:30;"but that he'd pull out the Harley Davidson cigarettes was amazing."
56:30;56:33;"And the packaging was that it was black."
56:33;56:35;"It was a black box."
56:35;56:36;"That's hard."
56:36;56:39;"With the, like the eagle on it, I believe, or the Harley Davidson logo."
56:39;56:42;"And so, yeah, but it was like very scary."
56:42;56:46;"I mean, it was, you know, cigarettes that just come in a black box."
56:46;56:50;"It's funny that there was Harley Davidson cigarettes because I'm sure I've"
56:50;56:54;"referenced this on the show at some point in the last 500 episodes,"
56:54;56:57;"but there's a movie that I've never actually seen,"
56:57;56:59;"but I know there's an infamous movie."
56:59;57:04;"I think it's from the 80s that was called Harley Davidson meets the Marlboro Man."
57:04;57:07;"And it was like an early branded film for two different brands where there's a"
57:07;57:11;"guy who became the personification of Harley Davidson."
57:11;57:16;"So there's a character named Harley Davidson and he somehow met the Marlboro Man"
57:16;57:19;"and they go on an adventure or some shit."
57:19;57:20;"Actually, Seinfeld, pull that up."
57:20;57:22;"Is it like an art film?"
57:22;57:24;"Like some sort of like Richard Prince kind of like ironic?"
57:24;57:25;"No, no, no, no."
57:25;57:26;"This is like trash."
57:26;57:28;"This is a trash film."
57:28;57:30;"You never heard of Harley Davidson meets the Marlboro Man?"
57:30;57:34;"I've heard of it, but it's very dim."
57:34;57:38;"Don Johnson and Mickey Rourke race onto the screen as two modern day Robin Hoods."
57:38;57:40;"Oh, it's big actors."
57:40;57:42;"Don Johnson and Mickey Rourke."
57:42;57:44;"And is that the title?"
57:44;57:46;"It's called Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man."
57:46;57:51;"Also starring Giancarlo Esposito, Gus Fring from Breaking Bad."
57:51;57:53;"Daniel Baldwin."
57:53;57:54;"Wait, hold on."
57:54;57:55;"What year did this movie come out?"
57:55;57:57;"'91."
57:57;57:59;"Okay, so this might be somebody's soul movie."
57:59;58:03;"I don't know if it was number one at the box office, but anybody who's born in 1981,"
58:03;58:08;"I want you to double check that Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man is your soul movie."
58:08;58:15;"The film cost $23 million to make and grossed $7 million at the domestic box office."
58:15;58:17;"Tom Sizemore, also in the film."
58:17;58:18;"Ooh, great character actor."
58:18;58:22;"Wait, so this is a big budget, big name movie?"
58:22;58:24;"Evidently."
58:24;58:25;"Whoa."
58:25;58:26;"Yeah."
58:26;58:28;"I mean, these are two huge brands."
58:28;58:32;"They're definitely not going for an arthouse movie."
58:32;58:33;"I mean, it's..."
58:33;58:34;"No."
58:34;58:36;"But..."
58:36;58:38;"Fields' character, so..."
58:38;58:39;"Sorry."
58:39;58:43;"Fields' character is named after the cigarette brand of Virginia Slims."
58:43;58:46;"Big John Studd's character is named after the whiskey brand Jack Daniels."
58:46;58:51;"And Eloy Cassado's character is named after the tequila brand Jose Cuervo."
58:51;58:56;"So it's kind of like an Avengers of Vices."
58:56;58:59;"Avengers of Vices."
58:59;59:04;"This MCU, this universe..."
59:04;59:07;"We gotta watch this movie."
59:07;59:10;"This is actually the time crisis soul movie."
59:10;59:13;"Yeah, this is TC movie club."
59:13;59:15;"Everyone's gonna watch it and discuss."
59:15;59:20;"If time crisis was a person, they probably would have been born in 1981, right in between me and Jake."
59:20;59:22;"And this would be their soul movie."
59:22;59:23;"Hell yeah."
59:23;59:26;"The TC man was born in '81 and this is his soul movie."
59:26;59:27;"Wow."
59:27;59:29;"Yeah, I'm so curious what the tone is."
59:29;59:30;"If it's just like..."
59:30;59:33;"It sounds like they just probably made a movie about a bunch of tough people."
59:33;59:35;"And they just use the names."
59:35;59:39;"Or I wonder if there's a lot of reference to the actual products."
59:39;59:41;"Yeah, I wonder what era is it set in."
59:41;59:42;"Is it a Western?"
59:42;59:44;"Is it a motorcycle gang?"
59:44;59:47;"And kind of proto-Sons of Anarchy kind of situation?"
59:47;59:48;"I mean, I'm just..."
59:48;59:49;"Now I'm intrigued."
59:49;59:54;"Kevin Thomas of the LA Times called it a mindless cobbling from countless buddy movies."
59:54;59:59;"Whereas Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called it a kinetic formula shoot 'em up."
59:59;01:00:00;"Nice."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"It sounds like it was set present day."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Like 1991."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"I don't think it was a period piece."
01:00:06;01:00:14;"Whatever it is, we should just take the plot and just make it about like all our favorite brands."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Mountain Dew and Flamin' Hot Cheetahs."
01:00:16;01:00:21;"And just like Ansel Elgort as Mountain Dew."
01:00:21;01:00:25;"Timothy Chalamet as Flamin' Hot Cheetahs."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Sidney Sweeney as Wendy."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"Colin Farrell as the Burger King."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"[Laughing]"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"Wait, so it's like about the brands and it's just like shut up and see the movie."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"It's a kinetic fast-paced shoot 'em up."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"They climb Mountain Dew."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"Yes."
01:00:43;01:00:44;"Right?"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"They go to Mountain Dew."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Yeah, they go to Mountain Dew."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"So this is actually a surreal film."
01:00:49;01:00:53;"Al Pacino is McDonald."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Oh, wait a second."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Okay, so Matt sent over the synopsis."
01:00:56;01:01:00;"It's a daring heist to save their favorite saloon."
01:01:00;01:01:12;"Set in the near future, the biker and his cowboy pal knock over an armored car only to discover its payload is a new synthetic drug that the bad guys will stop at nothing to get back."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"It's on HBO Max."
01:01:14;01:01:16;"Oh, wait, what the?"
01:01:16;01:01:24;"So Harley Davidson and Marlboro Man are just two guys, just two kind of like bar flies at a local saloon."
01:01:24;01:01:28;"I wonder if it opens, it's like the bartender comes like, ""Bad news guys, we got to close."""
01:01:28;01:01:31;"And Harley Davidson's like, ""No way, this is my favorite bar."""
01:01:31;01:01:35;"And he's like, ""My good friend Marlboro Man, are we going to stand for this?"""
01:01:35;01:01:40;"And he's just like, ""Absolutely not. Let's figure something out."""
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Is this guy's name Marlboro Man?"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"I'm just hypothesizing."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Like Harley Davidson could be a person's name."
01:01:45;01:01:52;"Yeah, I think what's happening is that they are, these people have been named after the thing that they're associated with maybe."
01:01:52;01:01:56;"So like Mickey, Mickey's character drives a Harley."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"Don Johnson's character smokes."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"And then so they call them, they just, those are their nicknames."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"It has like a Dick Tracy vibe."
01:02:04;01:02:05;"Okay."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"Oh, Tia Carrera's in this."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Oh, tight."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"All-star."
01:02:09;01:02:12;"I should have had the camel from Camel Cigarettes."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Joe."
01:02:13;01:02:14;"The bad guy."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Joe Camel."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Just like this disgusting, weird camel man."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"That would be like Dick Tracy."
01:02:22;01:02:29;"It's just like this weird ass camel man rolls into town and he's selling a synthetic drug to all the kids in the city."
01:02:29;01:02:32;"And the Marlboro Man and Harley Davidson need to stop him."
01:02:32;01:02:40;"Are you picturing like practical latex effects or like CG, like early proto CG effects for that Joe Camel bit?"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"It's going to look like Kangaroo Jack."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Okay."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"Yeah, actually, you know what?"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Fine."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"You guys f**ked up."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"You didn't put Joe Camel in."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Joe Camel's going to be in Mountain Dew and the Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"Timothy Chalamet is Flamin' Hot Cheeto."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Timothy Chalamet is Cheeto."
01:02:54;01:02:59;"And he just wears sort of like that Kanye, just like a red."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Just like a big red hoodie."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Yeah."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"Or like a red leather suit."
01:03:04;01:03:10;"Wait, is it a guy whose name is Cheeto or is he literally playing like a large inanimate object?"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"He's not Chester Cheeto."
01:03:11;01:03:12;"No, he's not Chester Cheeto."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"We don't have to explain this."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"He's not Chester Cheeto."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"See, that's the thing."
01:03:15;01:03:20;"No, we're going to be like, we're going to go meet with the studio executives who are going to ask exactly that question, Jake."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"And we're just going to say, can you just shut the f**k up?"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"It's a kinetic shoot 'em up."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Yeah, it's a kinetic shoot 'em up."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"No, no."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"Can I just stop you right there?"
01:03:27;01:03:31;"It really pisses me off when people ask these kind of questions."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"It's a kinetic shoot 'em up."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"The guy's name is Cheeto."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"You don't have to explain this to people."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"People are smarter than you give them credit for."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Well, I'm funding the movie."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"I want to know if he's playing a human or not."
01:03:41;01:03:47;"He's going to wear a red Yeezy sweatshirt and his name is Flamin' Hot Cheeto."
01:03:47;01:03:53;"Actually, now I'm thinking of a totally different movie that's just Chester Cheeto versus Joe Camel."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"This is actually a CG, a children's animated film."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"Late period Tim Burton."
01:03:58;01:03:59;"Yeah."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"I think that there would be a..."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Johnny Depp is Johnny."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Oh, Johnny Depp is Chester Cheeto?"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"That sounds like it actually happened."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"That definitely happened."
01:04:07;01:04:10;"Oh yeah, like it's just called Chester."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"That's a good Mandela effect one."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"Just start saying it."
01:04:13;01:04:17;"Next time anybody ever brings up the Mandela effect to you, like, yeah, when I always thought"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"that it was Berenstain Bears, but it's Berenstain Bears."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"And a lot of people remember it that way."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"Be like, yo, I'm with you."
01:04:22;01:04:28;"Like, for instance, I thought that Johnny Depp as Chester Cheeto never happened, but"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"actually that's a real film."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"No, no, no."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"I don't think that ever happened."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"No, it did."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"No, no."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"Millions of people remember seeing Johnny Depp in the Chester Cheeto movie."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"Tim Burton directed it."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"It came out in 2017."
01:04:41;01:04:46;"It's kind of underwhelming at the box office, but they made up for it with merch."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"No, no."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"Millions of people remember seeing this movie."
01:04:49;01:04:51;"It was huge in China."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"There's nothing on IMDB."
01:04:53;01:04:54;"I've talked with thousands of people."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"We get together at conferences and sh*t."
01:04:56;01:05:00;"We all remember it was the fourth most successful movie in the Chinese box office of all time."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"Yeah, yeah."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"Johnny Depp as Chester Cheeto."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Uh-huh."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"No, no."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Trust me."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"They memory hold it."
01:05:07;01:05:08;"They don't want people to know about it, but millions of us saw it."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"Did we lose those guys?"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"I think we lost the guys."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"Everyone cut out for a second on me."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"I got Matt and Ezra."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"Yeah, me too."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Those guys got trapped in the Matrix."
01:05:18;01:05:24;"They went into the universe where the Chester Cheeto Johnny Depp film was actually made."
01:05:25;01:05:32;"He's moving down the highway of the spring."
01:05:32;01:05:38;"He's never slowing down, he never takes a breath."
01:05:38;01:05:46;"He's a hell out of bed, like a devil laid to rest."
01:05:49;01:05:54;"He gets him on a spotlight, all day, day and night."
01:05:54;01:06:03;"All right, so now we've got Mountain Brews and Richard Pictures and LA Takedown collaborator,"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"Aaron Olsen, back on the program."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Let's get him on the horn."
01:06:06;01:06:10;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:06:10;01:06:14;"Hey."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"Aaron, welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Hi, thanks."
01:06:17;01:06:24;"First question for you, do you remember, did you ever see that late Tim Burton Johnny Depp Chester Cheeto movie?"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"Where Johnny Depp played Chester Cheeto."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"It was after Alice in Wonderland."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"After Big Eyes."
01:06:30;01:06:36;"It was in that same run where they did Big Eyes, Alice in Wonderland, they did the new Willy Wonka."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"They did a Chester Cheeto movie."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"No."
01:06:39;01:06:40;"Is this real?"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"What's happening?"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"It's like a 2017 Tim Burton film."
01:06:44;01:06:48;"It's actually one of the better of that kind of late period Tim Burton CG movies."
01:06:48;01:06:52;"Have you ever seen Harley Davidson in the Marlboro Man movie?"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"No, but I'm familiar with it."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"That has the Dice Man in it, right?"
01:06:56;01:06:59;"Andrew Dice Clay's in that too?"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"I knew Aaron would be familiar with this movie."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I think he plays a bouncer in it."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"I don't know."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"I mean, is this correct?"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"I don't know."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"I don't see Andrew Dice Clay listed in the accounts."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Maybe the Dice Man's not in it."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"It seems like something you did."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"No, that'd be perfect."
01:07:12;01:07:14;"Maybe it's an uncredited cameo."
01:07:14;01:07:19;"I've heard of the film, but I can't say I've heard of this Chester Cheeto film."
01:07:19;01:07:28;"But I wouldn't be surprised if they donned Johnny Depp in some orange cake dust and had him do that."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"What won't he do?"
01:07:30;01:07:33;"It's actually a really cool movie and Johnny had a lot of fun with it."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"He based a lot of his character on early Ozzy Osbourne."
01:07:38;01:07:45;"Because he just gets real wild and crazy and he felt like Ozzy was a cool person to pull from."
01:07:45;01:07:48;"Anyway, welcome back to the show."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"How's it going?"
01:07:49;01:07:50;"Thanks. It's good."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"Things are fine."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"How are you guys doing?"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"Doing great over here."
01:07:55;01:07:56;"Not bad."
01:07:56;01:08:04;"Aaron, your band, LA Takedown, released an album called Our Feeling of Natural High in March of 2020."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Yes."
01:08:05;01:08:16;"You were slated to play a record release show doing exclusively Doors covers on Friday, March 13th or something."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"Is that right?"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"That's all correct."
01:08:18;01:08:25;"And yeah, if we're lucky, it'll get canceled again and then I'll get back on Time Crisis again after that to talk about it."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"That's what I was going to say."
01:08:26;01:08:30;"Because you've rescheduled the gig for a year and a half later."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"It's scheduled for what day? September something?"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"September 10th."
01:08:34;01:08:40;"But I've been wondering about this as the Delta variant, all this kind of stuff."
01:08:40;01:08:46;"I feel like there's, I don't know, what, 50% chance this gets canceled again?"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"There's a chance."
01:08:47;01:09:00;"In general, I have a lot of things coming up, like live various performances, and I'm just taking the attitude of saying yes and then trying to not be disappointed when they get canceled."
01:09:00;01:09:07;"But yeah, there's a chance and then there's a chance I'll come back on Time Crisis and talk about how it got canceled again."
01:09:07;01:09:11;"And then we can just keep doing this for years to come, I think."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"The Doors show that never happened."
01:09:13;01:09:21;"If this one gets canceled, I mean, we've talked at length on Time Crisis about how the people kind of turned their back on the Doors."
01:09:21;01:09:25;"In the 90s, the Doors were considered one of the major classic rock bands."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"People like Jim Morrison, they had posters of him."
01:09:27;01:09:30;"And then people really turned their back on the Doors."
01:09:30;01:09:39;"If this show gets canceled, I think that's definitive proof that not only have rock fans turned their backs on the Doors, the universe has on the quantum level."
01:09:39;01:09:44;"If this one gets canceled again, I'm sorry, Doors fans."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Like, that's that."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"The Lord is spoken."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Throw in the towel."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Crosby wins."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"They don't swing, man."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"They do not swing."
01:09:53;01:10:04;"I'm just picturing Crosby overlaid with the clouds in the sky and he's just laughing his ass off."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"He has an evil Crosby laugh."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"He's dead in this scenario."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"No, he's not dead."
01:10:11;01:10:14;"He just represents the Godhead."
01:10:14;01:10:24;"I'm picturing a situation like someone tweets at him like, ""Doors cover band show canceled,"" and then he's kind of by himself in his house, nodding, smiling, and doing a..."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"Good, man."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"Just clapping by himself."
01:10:27;01:10:28;"Yeah, you know."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"That would be a classic Crosby tweet."
01:10:30;01:10:32;"Yeah, just he quote tweets it."
01:10:32;01:10:40;"Just like some rando just tweets at him, ""Hey, Cros, there's been a Doors cover band in LA that just had their second show in a row get canceled."""
01:10:40;01:10:45;"Hey, Cros, you just quote tweet that and above it write, ""Good."""
01:10:45;01:10:47;"""Good, period."""
01:10:47;01:10:49;"Serves him right."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"What's the name of the Doors cover band again?"
01:10:51;01:11:00;"Riders on the Doors, A. The Doors Experience."
01:11:00;01:11:06;"I think we have John Nixon of Richard Pictures and Mountain Brews to thank for that one."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"Riders on the Doors, colon?"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"A. The Doors Experience, yes."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"A. The Doors Experience."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"A. The Doors Experience, yes."
01:11:14;01:11:24;"I like the wordy names. It kind of reminds me a little bit of our Eagles band that never played a gig where it was Dick Picks Presents... No, wait, what was it?"
01:11:24;01:11:27;"It was Dick Picks Presents Barely Eagles."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Right, right."
01:11:28;01:11:55;"I don't want to get too contentious here, but I just got asked, I'm hearing that John from Richard Pictures is involved in this. Was the offer ever extended to Jake? Was there a lack of interest? I'm not trying to stir shit up in the organization, but is it possible, did you feel like, you know what, maybe Jake swings too hard to be in a Doors cover band?"
01:11:55;01:12:01;"I definitely have the least amount of swing of any of the people that we play music with."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"I can vouch for that."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"Not my forte."
01:12:06;01:12:14;"But I don't know. I mean, Jake was there when the initial, when the genesis of this happened."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Yeah, I don't know what I would do."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Yeah, I think that's more the thing."
01:12:18;01:12:30;"You know, there's no, I mean, the Doors was a pretty minimalist outfit, so there's just not a lot for me to do with a Doors cover band. Look, with Richard Pictures and Mountain Brews, my plate is full."
01:12:30;01:12:40;"I think that might have been the thing too, is like, you were just, I can imagine the situation having gone like, oh, that's cool, guys, like, I'm gonna sit this out. Or like, I'm just out."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"I mean, to be honest, I never received an offer."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Okay."
01:12:44;01:12:49;"But that's okay. No offense taken. I don't think there'd be much for me to do."
01:12:49;01:12:50;"Yeah."
01:12:50;01:12:57;"One question I have is, when you do Touch Me, how big is the horn section and string section that you're bringing with you?"
01:12:57;01:13:00;"Huge. We got the Philharmonic."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"So for Touch Me, you're gonna have about 40 people on stage."
01:13:03;01:13:08;"Yeah, at the Permanent Records Roadhouse."
01:13:08;01:13:19;"Yeah, we're just doing it. It's gonna be keys. Ryan's gonna be playing keys. We're not gonna have any horns or anything. And then I think John even learned the sax solo on the guitar."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Of course he did."
01:13:21;01:13:26;"Yeah, of course. So yeah, we're not having any horns. We're keeping it, you know, roadhouse-y."
01:13:26;01:13:35;"And this show's on September 10th. Do you think you're gonna make it to midnight? And if so, are you gonna say anything about the 20th anniversary of 9/11?"
01:13:35;01:13:42;"You know, you've given me an idea, but I don't know what I could possibly say or what, you know, our Jim could..."
01:13:42;01:13:48;"You know, maybe he could recite a poem, like an American prayer excerpt at the stroke of midnight."
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Isn't there a Dora song called The End?"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Yes."
01:13:52;01:14:00;"Oh yeah, you could go into The End. And when you do the kind of spoken word, you can say something about 9/11 or something kind of serious."
01:14:00;01:14:05;"We can go into the inside job angle and like, you know, just this will be the perfect..."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"Oh yeah, Tower 7 monologue."
01:14:07;01:14:13;"Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Jessica, who's our Jim, can just totally go off on a... do her Crosby, actually."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"Crosby at Monterey and do the whole conspiracy rant and it'll be great."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"All right, well, that's something to look forward to."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"So yeah."
01:14:20;01:14:30;"I will at least say, hey guys, I know some of you in the crowd are probably expecting we're going to do a whole 9/11 20th anniversary rap tonight because it's the night before."
01:14:30;01:14:34;"We just wanted to say we don't think that's appropriate."
01:14:34;01:14:39;"If anybody wants to come rap with us after the show, we'll be at the merch table."
01:14:39;01:14:41;"I like you."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"Yeah, what Ed's just saying, it might be weirder if you don't do it."
01:14:44;01:14:48;"Right. I just got to say that sucks."
01:14:48;01:14:56;"The last thing I want is people to come up to me at a merch table ready to talk about 9/11."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"Like one in the morning."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Yeah, I will say I do."
01:15:00;01:15:01;"You got to say something."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Yeah. OK, I get that. Yeah."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"You know, it'll be the elephant in the room if we don't address it."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"Everyone's going to be..."
01:15:09;01:15:11;"Just because it's the 20th anniversary. Is that why?"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"Yes."
01:15:12;01:15:21;"I do think that somewhere out there, there is someone who A) thinks the Doors are the quintessential American band."
01:15:21;01:15:30;"And then thus is going to be like listening to the Doors commemorating the 20th year anniversary of 9/11."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"I feel like in someone's head out there, that makes sense."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"Yes, they're definitely over the age of 50."
01:15:37;01:15:42;"I think the Doors might be the quintessential American band, but you know what's weird about it?"
01:15:42;01:15:46;"I got to think more about this, but I remember the Doors being very big in the 90s."
01:15:46;01:15:50;"They were considered one of the most important American classic rock bands."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"And then in the following decades, that changed."
01:15:52;01:15:57;"Did 9/11 have something to do with it in some weird way?"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"I'm being serious."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Like they're really..."
01:16:00;01:16:04;"I mean, anybody who was actually alive during 9/11 and certainly in the years that followed,"
01:16:04;01:16:09;"I remember there was so much talk about ""Irony is dead"" and ""This changes everything"""
01:16:09;01:16:11;"and ""This is like a watershed moment for culture."""
01:16:11;01:16:13;"People said a lot of stuff like that."
01:16:13;01:16:18;"Was there something about the post 9/11 era that was unfavorable to the Doors and their legacy?"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"I feel like they would have thrived."
01:16:20;01:16:31;"Like they represent a bold American bravado in a way that probably would have resonated with people at the time"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"who are getting amped up about America."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"Or are they too far out?"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"You know, they had a song called ""20th Century Fox."""
01:16:37;01:16:42;"Well, they were a 20th century band, man, because they got left in the 20th century."
01:16:42;01:16:47;"We're trying to change all that here at the Roadhouse by playing to 50 people."
01:16:47;01:16:53;"I'm very curious to see A) if this show happens, and B) how that affects the trajectory of the Doors,"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"because the last 20 years have been very anti-Doors."
01:16:56;01:17:00;"Are you going to play any LA Takedown material or is it only Doors?"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"It's only Doors."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"I respect the conceptual tightness of that."
01:17:03;01:17:11;"Ryan Weinstein, who will be DJing the show, will be playing songs from our album throughout the night."
01:17:11;01:17:21;"He also, hopefully, will play—I made years ago a ""Light My Fire"" house mix based off of a note I left myself"
01:17:21;01:17:24;"that just said ""Light My Fire"" house mix."
01:17:24;01:17:31;"But it's just a house version of ""Light My Fire,"" and I had it cut for him a long time ago on a record."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"So hopefully he'll be playing that, but it's just the opening riff with like..."
01:17:34;01:17:38;"[Ryan sings the opening riff]"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"Okay, so even there's something for dance music fans."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"Oh yeah."
01:17:42;01:17:49;"Anybody who lives within 500 miles of Los Angeles, get your ass to the Permanent Records Roadhouse"
01:17:49;01:17:55;"on September 10th to see ""Riders on the Doors, A. The Doors Experience."""
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Did I get it right?"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"You got it right."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"A. The."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Okay."
01:17:59;01:18:03;"Yeah, I'm going to add to that, please get vaccinated before you come to our show."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"Oh yeah, that too."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Let me just throw that in there."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"And make sure you've seen your soul movie."
01:18:08;01:18:13;"You can't get into the show or any gathering until you've seen your soul movie."
01:18:13;01:18:14;"Also true."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"I think I listened to the episode where you talked about soul movies."
01:18:17;01:18:23;"We did one episode of ""Time Crisis,"" but you also might have heard about it on ""The Daily"""
01:18:23;01:18:29;"or ""Pod Save America"" or ""Joe Rogan"" because Joe Biden was doing kind of a press tour"
01:18:29;01:18:33;"to talk about soul movies because he's serious about it."
01:18:33;01:18:37;"Yeah, that was a great episode of the Joe Rogan experience when President Biden went on"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"and talked about soul movies."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"[laughter]"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"Racked up like 10 million views in the first week."
01:18:42;01:18:48;"Jeez. Okay. You guys clearly know what I'm listening to in my spare time."
01:19:23;01:19:28;"You know, Aaron, I was thinking about you the other day because I came across this"
01:19:28;01:19:31;"gentle giant album cover."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"Do you know ""Gentle Giant""?"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"I do. They have one of the great mascots of rock."
01:19:35;01:19:39;"Do you know this? It's called ""Acquiring the Taste."" Can you see it at all?"
01:19:39;01:19:43;"It's so similar to your dad's airbrushed painting that you used."
01:19:43;01:19:46;"It's like, I don't know if you could really see the texture."
01:19:46;01:19:50;"That's the cover and then it has that same look of kind of 70s airbrushed."
01:19:50;01:19:53;"And it's just such a crazy cover too. ""Acquiring the Taste."""
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Yes."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"And is that a tongue licking a peach?"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Yeah."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"It's so graphic."
01:19:59;01:20:03;"That is a great album title too. ""Acquiring the Taste."""
01:20:03;01:20:04;"""Acquiring the Taste."""
01:20:04;01:20:11;"And honestly, I'm not a big gentle giant head or anything, but that is a good entry point for the band."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"So it is aptly named."
01:20:12;01:20:13;"That album in particular?"
01:20:13;01:20:19;"Yeah. Also, I should point out, Gentle Giant's mascot is like a bald guy with a beard."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"I don't know if you've ever seen that."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"No. He's the gentle giant?"
01:20:24;01:20:27;"I guess. He's just a human as far as I can tell."
01:20:27;01:20:30;"This cover is psycho."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"It's amazing."
01:20:31;01:20:39;"I'm honored that that gross man licking a peach's crack made you think of me."
01:20:39;01:20:41;"We got to start a Gentle Giant cover band."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"Geez. No."
01:20:43;01:20:46;"The band is called ""Acquiring the Taste."" A Gentle Giant tribute."
01:20:46;01:20:49;"That probably exists."
01:20:49;01:20:51;"It probably does."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Okay. Let's get into the top five."
01:20:53;01:21:00;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:00;01:21:06;"Okay. So this week for the top five, we're comparing the top five hits of two different years."
01:21:06;01:21:10;"1965 and 1995."
01:21:10;01:21:13;"30 years apart, but a lot changed in those 30 years."
01:21:13;01:21:15;"So Aaron, you picked these years, right?"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"Yeah."
01:21:16;01:21:20;"How'd you come up with '65 and '95?"
01:21:20;01:21:24;"I couldn't decide between '65 or '95."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Just because I thought, you know, those are..."
01:21:26;01:21:32;"Okay. '95 is probably my peak of paying attention to current music."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"How old were you?"
01:21:33;01:21:36;"I was 10. I still have a VHS tape."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"That's your peak? Wow."
01:21:37;01:21:39;"I think so."
01:21:39;01:21:45;"I kept a VHS tape in the VCR and I'd record every time a music video came on that I liked."
01:21:45;01:21:48;"And I still have the tape. And it's like... I'm pretty sure that's from '95."
01:21:48;01:21:51;"'95 is also the year your Soul movie came out."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"What kind of videos would you have been recording in '95?"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"What would come on TV that you'd be like, ""Oh, s***!""?"
01:21:57;01:22:02;"Yeah. There were some kind of grail videos that I was waiting for and that I never got."
01:22:02;01:22:06;"I remember really wanting to catch ""So What You Want"" by the Beastie Boys."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"Oh, that's a good one."
01:22:07;01:22:10;"It's all like they're in a forest and it's all fish."
01:22:10;01:22:15;"But yeah, there's like Beck ""Loser"" is on there twice for some reason."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"And ""Mother""... I think it's called ""Mother '95""."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"It's the Danzig."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"By Rollins Band?"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"The Danzig."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"Oh, the Danzig. Right."
01:22:23;01:22:26;"But it's like a slightly different version of ""Mother""."
01:22:26;01:22:29;"But it has a lot of concert footage and I always thought it was really hilarious,"
01:22:29;01:22:34;"like how well shampooed his hair was."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"You thought this was funny when you were 10?"
01:22:37;01:22:40;"Yeah, I thought Danzig was pretty funny when I was 10."
01:22:40;01:22:43;"He's also wearing a mesh tank top. I thought all these things were funny."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"Oh, I remember that video."
01:22:44;01:22:47;"Yeah. And it has all these cuts. It cuts to him. He's shaking his head really..."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"I don't know. Worth watching that video."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"But yeah, that stuff's on there."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"""Sweater Song""?"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"No, that's actually not on there."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"Some Nirvana. There's like the interstitials that they had."
01:22:59;01:23:03;"It was like a guy spinning a globe, picking a place to move to."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I don't know. It was just the weird..."
01:23:05;01:23:09;"But '95 was my peak of being interested in MTV at least."
01:23:09;01:23:16;"And then '65, I love the music of the '60s, so I thought, ""Let's try that."""
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Roughly we're 30 years..."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"30 years apart."
01:23:18;01:23:23;"Yeah, roughly we're 30 years from '95. We're getting there."
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Pretty close."
01:23:24;01:23:28;"All right. Well, the number five song this week in 1965 was ""The Four Tops"""
01:23:28;01:23:31;"with ""It's the Same Old Song""."
01:23:31;01:23:34;"A classic Holland Dozier Holland song."
01:23:34;01:23:41;"# You're sweet as a honeybee"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"# But like a honeybee sings"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"# You're gonna let my heart in pain"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"# All you left, all you left"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"# Is my favourite song"
01:23:49;01:23:53;"# The one you dance to all night long"
01:23:53;01:23:57;"# Used to bring sweet memories"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"# Of a tender love that used to be"
01:24:00;01:24:04;"# Now it's the same old song"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"# But with a different meaning"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"# Since you made me feel the same... #"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"The drums are really hypnotic on this song."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"I remember having a Casio keyboard, and that was the Motown beat."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"Oh, really? Oh, was this?"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"Yeah, preset beats. It's just snare on every beat."
01:24:19;01:24:23;"And then the kick comes in between the last two snares, usually."
01:24:23;01:24:28;"It's worth noting that this is 32 years later after this song came out."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"The Four Tops starred in a commercial for Velveeta,"
01:24:31;01:24:35;"where they reworked this song as ""Not the Same Old Side""."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Sample lyric."
01:24:36;01:24:40;"""For a side dish made to please, you only want Velveeta shells and cheese."""

01:59:15;01:59:18;"-Feels like a '95. Yeah, it is '95. -Wow."
01:59:18;01:59:20;"Wow. That's weird."
01:59:20;01:59:23;"-That's weird. -It's crazy, dude."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"( laughs )"
01:59:25;01:59:28;"You guys watch ""Swingers"" any time recently?"
01:59:28;01:59:30;"-A couple years ago. -Yeah, last five years."
01:59:30;01:59:33;"-I watched it over quarantine. -Lots of babes?"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"Well, it's not the ""Babe."" It's not ""Babes."""
01:59:35;01:59:38;"It's the-- I mean, it actually started out"
01:59:38;01:59:42;"so much more than I remember the way that he says, uh,"
01:59:42;01:59:45;"""Baby"" and calls everyone ""beautiful babies."""
01:59:45;01:59:47;"And it's just like-- it's like-- it's--"
01:59:47;01:59:50;"but it's not even just like three or four times where I remembered it."
01:59:50;01:59:52;"It's like hundreds of times in the movie."
01:59:52;01:59:54;"He's like, ""Look at all the beautiful babies."
01:59:54;01:59:56;"Look at all-- hey, baby. Babies. Baby."""
01:59:56;01:59:58;"It's really, uh--"
01:59:58;02:00:01;"-'Cause they were trying to redo, like, a Rat Pack thing. -It's outrageous. Exactly."
02:00:01;02:00:03;"""Hey, baby."
02:00:03;02:00:06;"Oh, baby. What's the problem, baby? Baby, baby."""
02:00:06;02:00:08;"We need a People's History of the word ""babe."""
02:00:08;02:00:11;"Well, I'll tell you, the first use of it was--"
02:00:11;02:00:13;"-Yeah? -In 19-- was in--"
02:00:13;02:00:16;"the first use of ""baby"" was in 1839."
02:00:16;02:00:18;"-Of ""babe""? -Using ""baby"""
02:00:18;02:00:20;"as a term of endearment."
02:00:20;02:00:22;"-Hmm. Oh. -That's the first"
02:00:22;02:00:24;"sort of known use of it,"
02:00:24;02:00:28;"where sugar appeared in 1930."
02:00:28;02:00:31;"-So-- -So ""baby"" predates ""sugar."""
02:00:31;02:00:34;"Yeah, I'm-- I'm sure that ""babe"" is just"
02:00:34;02:00:37;"sort of a reaction to that"
02:00:37;02:00:39;"more Rat Pack-y ""baby, baby,"""
02:00:39;02:00:43;"but, yeah, something maybe hipper in the '60s, you know?"
02:00:43;02:00:46;"You guys, it's the '60s. We're not calling chicks ""baby"" anymore."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"-Babe. -We're not calling chicks ""baby"" anymore."
02:00:48;02:00:52;"-The number one song-- -We're calling them chicks."
02:00:52;02:00:54;"(laughter)"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"We're calling chicks ""chicks."""
02:00:56;02:00:58;"The number one song"
02:00:58;02:01:01;"in 1995."
02:01:01;02:01:03;"Oh, this is another big one."
02:01:03;02:01:05;"I think these are both, like, very evocative"
02:01:05;02:01:07;"of the '60s and the '90s."
02:01:07;02:01:09;"The number one song this week in 1995."
02:01:09;02:01:11;"I think we've heard this on TC before."
02:01:11;02:01:14;"-Yeah. -""Seal,"" ""Kiss From a Rose."""
02:01:14;02:01:16;"(singing)"
02:01:16;02:01:25;"This song is kind of proggy, right?"
02:01:25;02:01:28;"-Oh, yeah. -There's a few surprising changes."
02:01:28;02:01:31;"Very Renaissance intro."
02:01:31;02:01:34;"Did I ever share my ""Seal"" story with you guys?"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"I don't think so."
02:01:36;02:01:38;"I was at this--"
02:01:38;02:01:41;"It was an event, but it was with, like, hundreds of people."
02:01:41;02:01:43;"You know, like, a few hundred people."
02:01:43;02:01:45;"So it was almost like a TED Talk-y type thing."
02:01:45;02:01:47;"So it wasn't an intimate group."
02:01:47;02:01:49;"And he was one of the speakers."
02:01:49;02:01:52;"And he was sort of talking about his process."
02:01:52;02:01:55;"At the end, he was like,"
02:01:55;02:01:58;"""You know, to sort of think creatively,"
02:01:58;02:02:01;"I go on a lot of hikes. I hike Runyon Canyon."""
02:02:01;02:02:05;"""And if anybody here wants to go on a hike with me,"
02:02:05;02:02:08;"just meet me after this. I'll give you my phone number."
02:02:08;02:02:11;"And we can go on a hike together."""
02:02:11;02:02:15;"And obviously it's a huge regret I didn't do it."
02:02:15;02:02:17;"But it wasn't an ironic--"
02:02:17;02:02:19;"Like, this is to hundreds of people."
02:02:19;02:02:22;"""Seal"" was like, ""See me after my speech."
02:02:22;02:02:25;"Go on a hike with me, and we'll get creative."""
02:02:25;02:02:27;"-Whoa. -And I did--"
02:02:27;02:02:30;"I have to think about it. I had this sort of moment with him afterwards"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"where we talked, he came up to me,"
02:02:32;02:02:35;"'cause I didn't really know anyone at this event, and I was alone."
02:02:35;02:02:37;"And he came up and was like, ""What's up, man?"""
02:02:37;02:02:39;"That, and I know I've told that Bieber story"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"that people have brought up to me."
02:02:41;02:02:44;"Those are two super kind vibe guys."
02:02:44;02:02:47;"But I mean, yeah, so if you want,"
02:02:47;02:02:50;"probably head out around 7.30 a.m. to Runyon Canyon."
02:02:50;02:02:52;"You're gonna see Seal just on a hike."
02:02:52;02:02:56;"And Seal, he was at a TED Talk-esque event with hundreds of people."
02:02:56;02:02:59;"And he just saw you by yourself, and he just said--"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"he was like, ""Hey, lonely man."
02:03:01;02:03:03;"-What's your story?"" -Yeah."
02:03:03;02:03:05;"Yeah, yeah. Everyone sort of--"
02:03:05;02:03:08;"I did get the feeling I was invited"
02:03:08;02:03:11;"sort of last minute to this event, and I really didn't know anybody."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"And maybe I just had that energy."
02:03:13;02:03:16;"But he came up to me, and he was like, ""Yeah, what's up, lonely man?"""
02:03:16;02:03:18;"But just the--"
02:03:18;02:03:20;"-But just the-- -Hello, lonely man."
02:03:20;02:03:23;"But the idea of telling a huge auditorium of people,"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"""Come see me. I'll give you my phone number"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"if you ever want to go on a hike together."""
02:03:27;02:03:30;"I just-- I never forget it."
02:03:30;02:03:32;"If you want to talk about 9/11,"
02:03:32;02:03:35;"I'll give you my phone number, and you can give me a call."
02:03:35;02:03:37;"We'll talk."
02:03:37;02:03:39;"That's how you end."
02:03:39;02:03:41;"You don't want to talk at the merch table."
02:03:41;02:03:44;"But give me your number, and we'll go on a hike."
02:03:44;02:03:48;"-We won't do it at 1 a.m. -Then it busts into this part."
02:03:48;02:03:50;"Oh, yeah."
02:03:50;02:03:57;"# I've been kissed by a rose"
02:03:57;02:04:00;"I love that this beautiful song is attached"
02:04:00;02:04:03;"to Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze."
02:04:03;02:04:06;"-And, like-- -No, no, it's a different movie."
02:04:06;02:04:08;"-It's a different movie? -That's Batman and Robin."
02:04:08;02:04:11;"This is Batman Forever, which is Tommy Lee Jones."
02:04:11;02:04:14;"And, yes, and Jim Carrey as the Riddler."
02:04:14;02:04:16;"Yeah, well, that's just as good."
02:04:16;02:04:19;"I just saw a video of Jim Carrey singing"
02:04:19;02:04:23;"""I Am the Walrus"" with George Martin orchestrating."
02:04:23;02:04:26;"Wow. And it's, like, serious?"
02:04:26;02:04:28;"It's hard to say. I mean..."
02:04:28;02:04:32;"-Is it a live event? -It's, like, an in-studio video."
02:04:32;02:04:34;"It's ( bleep ) up."
02:04:34;02:04:38;"I don't know why George Martin did that."
02:04:38;02:04:41;"Should we just go out on this ""Kiss from a Rose""?"
02:04:41;02:04:43;"Yeah, this is perfect."
02:04:43;02:04:45;"All right."
