00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis back once again. Today we talk Ben and Jerry's, but this time we'll be joined by"
00:07;00:14;"their head of global activism and strategy, Chris Miller. We'll also take another dive"
00:14;00:26;"into the worlds of Reese's. All that plus the greatest hits of 1978 and 2020. This is Time Crisis"
00:26;00:30;"with Ezra Koenig."
01:14;01:22;"All right, Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake? Not much, how are you? I'm all right. I'm trying out these new power beats"
01:22;01:28;"that Apple sent me. They're Bluetooth. I can roam free, get some steps in while we do the show."
01:28;01:34;"Just to be clear, it's a wireless earbud. Is that what that is? Yeah, it's connected in the back,"
01:34;01:39;"so it's not like two earbuds, but it's two together. I don't know, I've always like kind of resisted the"
01:39;01:46;"AirBud lifestyle. Oh, big time. It's kind of dorky, but you know, it works well. They sound good."
01:46;01:50;"So it's sort of like when you like have, you're wearing like sunglasses and you have the sort of"
01:50;01:56;"like, what are those called? Like croquis or whatever? Yeah, croquis. That's like the main brand."
01:56;02:01;"I got a pair of those once when I used to wear some, I think I'm ready to start wearing sunglasses again."
02:01;02:07;"But there was like a time where I'd wear sunglasses all the time and I realized like croquis should be standard"
02:07;02:12;"just to like have that on your neck because you always lose sunglasses. Yeah. I mean, how often are you wearing"
02:12;02:19;"sunglasses, Jake? Every day. I keep sunglasses in the car. And what are you rocking? Ray-Bans?"
02:19;02:25;"No, just like Walgreens. Because yeah, I know you mean I lose sunglasses. So if I lose my sunglasses or like"
02:25;02:31;"sit on them or something, then I go into like the CVS or the Walgreens and just buy just whatever's available."
02:31;02:38;"I'll buy the coolest looking pair. What's that going to run you? A pair of Walgreens or CVS sunglasses?"
02:38;02:47;"Anywhere from like $7.99 to maybe $18.99. I was going to say $7.99. That was my guess. What's it going to cost? $18.99?"
02:47;02:54;"You know, I just think it's the design. I think last time I bought sunglasses at CVS, I think it dropped to $18.99."
02:54;03:03;"And I just was like, Oh my God, this design the most is worth it to me. They look great. And it's worth the extra $10."
03:03;03:09;"Were you interacting at all with an employee there? Like at a high end boutique where you're just like,"
03:09;03:15;"I mean, these definitely are the most expensive in the store. And they're just like, Sir, I got to say,"
03:15;03:21;"these look great on you. You'd be crazy not to leave here with these. And you're like, really? Okay."
03:21;03:30;"$18.99 is a really funny price to me. I don't know why when you say $18.99 for me, that price is always will be tied into my brain"
03:30;03:37;"as like an expensive CD in the late 90s. I also feel like after the kind of crash of the music industry,"
03:37;03:44;"after that 1999 peak that we've talked about a lot, I do feel like that number would pop up in articles."
03:44;03:50;"It's like, you got to understand, man, it was like the last days of Rome in the music industry."
03:50;03:56;"They were getting real greedy. I mean, these fools are charging $18.99 for a CD, man. That was like very expensive."
03:56;04:02;"$18.99. Yeah, especially if you're a teenager. There's just something about that price that will always just like strike me as like,"
04:02;04:09;"a little bit outrageous. It's a funny price because like, what's something that should just straight up is a bargain at $18.99."
04:09;04:17;"It's like even food, even with inflation and the high cost of living, even most food items, if they cost $18.99,"
04:17;04:25;"like a sandwich that was like $18 or $19, that's kind of crazy. There's definitely cocktails in the COVID era,"
04:25;04:29;"it seems like such a bygone era is like people complaining about the prices of cocktails."
04:29;04:37;"But I feel like for a long time, that was like a symbol of like, hipster gentrification of cities,"
04:37;04:44;"where people be like, if you want to go suck down a $10 martini, yeah, sure, you can go to that neighborhood, but it's disgusting."
04:44;04:53;"And then I think it just kept ratcheting up to be like, they're literally charging $19 for cocktails at this place, maybe even $20."
04:53;04:56;"I don't think I've ever dropped more than like 14 on a drink."
04:56;04:57;"And 14 is a lot."
04:57;05:06;"14 was like, damn, like I'm in some weird, fancy place. And it's like, you know, that's like the sort of like tequila based drink."
05:06;05:09;"I'm like, all right, I guess I'll get that."
05:09;05:17;"I just think with tequila, that's like such a classic move at like a venue or like a fancy bar, where you're kind of like,"
05:17;05:22;"Oh, well, you know, I'm cool with like the well tequila. And they're like, that is the price for that."
05:22;05:26;"You're like, how much does it cost for like Patron? And like, that would be $23."
05:26;05:28;"Yeah, I'll stick with the well."
05:28;05:34;"I've definitely been in that position to act kind of like a grungy music venue, where they were like, what kind of tequila do you want?"
05:34;05:39;"I don't know why I always just like say Patron. Clearly, they did a good job with their branding."
05:39;05:45;"And then suddenly they're like, okay, well, it was $11 extra per drink for the Patron."
05:45;05:46;"You're like, Jesus Christ."
05:46;05:47;"Oh, my God."
05:47;05:48;"Terrible."
05:49;05:52;"Oh, yeah. Have one on me."
05:52;05:57;"Of that sweet, sweet chili heat."
05:57;06:05;"Oh, yeah. Let's take a deep with that sweet, sweet chili heat."
06:05;06:14;"Dead night in the Dina at the old town pub."
06:14;06:22;"Two sets at a beer bar, we're drinking mostly bug."
06:22;06:30;"But sometimes I gotta take a nib, something with heat, something with kick."
06:30;06:39;"So fill that flask with tequila if you please."
06:39;06:47;"Oh, yeah. Have one on me. Of that sweet, sweet chili heat."
06:47;06:55;"Oh, yeah. Let's take a deep. There's plenty to share. There's more than I need."
06:55;06:59;"How much does a beer cost at a baseball game? Is that like $18?"
06:59;07:00;"It might be."
07:00;07:04;"Let's ask our producer, Matt. You're probably the biggest sports fan on here."
07:04;07:08;"How much does an MLB beer cost? I guess it probably is different depending on the market."
07:08;07:13;"It's different depending on the market. I can tell you Angel Stadium is actually the cheapest. It's about 10."
07:13;07:17;"Yankee Stadium, it's about 15 on average."
07:17;07:26;"The average cost for a small draft beer at a major league baseball game this season was $5.98."
07:26;07:33;"Well, all right. So we're getting a number crunch that says the average MLB draft beer is more like $6."
07:33;07:36;"A $6 beer sounds like the 1980s or something."
07:36;07:46;"All right. So I want to just tell you that in 2019, the most expensive beer that you could get was at a New York Mets game."
07:46;07:51;"Yeah. And that was $11. This is according to Statista.com."
07:51;07:54;"I don't buy this. Wait, you're on Statista.com?"
07:54;08:01;"Statista.com. I'm crunching the numbers as best I can without Seinfeld here. I'm looking at a graph."
08:01;08:06;"You don't have all of Seinfeld's logins and specialized technology, but OK."
08:06;08:09;"I respect your effort."
08:09;08:11;"That just sounds wrong."
08:11;08:12;"It's definitely wrong."
08:12;08:18;"It definitely sounds wrong when you go down to the Colorado Rockies game that has a $3 beer. I just find that unbelievable."
08:18;08:25;"Well, OK. First of all, with baseball stadium beer, I think when you talk about a Colorado Rockies, that's beer country."
08:25;08:31;"Beer is a natural resource out there, so they probably have a tie in with the Coors family."
08:31;08:33;"Sure. Coors Field."
08:33;08:34;"Is it called Coors Field?"
08:34;08:35;"Pretty sure."
08:35;08:44;"I wonder if just beer is cheaper in beer states. Is beer cheaper in Missouri and Colorado just because they're beer states?"
08:44;08:52;"Probably just by virtue of everything being cheaper there as opposed to the coastal cities, but sure."
08:52;08:58;"If you asked me, and I had to guess what the statistics would be for beer, I would have guessed it'd be something like,"
08:58;09:08;"well, there's quite a range of beer prices at baseball stadiums. Famously, at the Milwaukee Brewers Stadium,"
09:08;09:15;"they still have a special thing where you can get a small beer for $3.25. It's kind of like a bit of a tradition there."
09:15;09:23;"It's the lowest, but on the high end, you have a kind of in the new Yankee Stadium, there's kind of an artisanal beer kiosk"
09:23;09:32;"where the prices range up to $45 for a Belgian beer that's made by monks."
09:32;09:41;"I would totally buy that if they were just like MLB beer in a nutshell, $3.25 to $45 at Yankee Stadium."
09:41;09:45;"But you know, when you all said it, the average price is $15.25."
09:45;09:54;"Yeah, I mean, I go to Dodgers games a few times a year. I feel like I'm dropping something absurd, like $16 for a Modelo."
09:54;09:55;"Really?"
09:55;10:04;"Yeah, it's just annoying. I don't like slam beer either. After like 12 ounces of beer, I'm slowing down unless I get a new cold one."
10:04;10:10;"You just get to that last third and it just starts to get room temp and, ugh, gross."
10:10;10:17;"You could easily consume that amount of beer in an evening. It's just such a terrible way to do it because of the temperature."
10:17;10:22;"Yeah, I did have the worst margarita of my life at Dodger Stadium though."
10:22;10:27;"The worst margarita of my life."
10:27;10:31;"Sounds like a Warren Zevon song or something."
10:31;10:38;"I'm picturing like Warren Zevon kind of like gently ribbing Jimmy Buffett with a parody song."
10:38;10:43;"You could imagine those guys are like hanging out on some like really fancy yacht."
10:43;10:47;"First of all, RIP Zevon. But maybe back in the day, they're hanging out."
10:47;10:51;"And I'll tell you, man, I love Jimmy, but I give that guy a lot of s***."
10:51;10:56;"He's got too many songs about margaritas and they're always about how great margaritas are."
10:56;10:59;"And I was like, you know, I'm going to write a song about the worst margarita of my life."
10:59;11:02;"And this is a true story, man. I had it at a Dodger Stadium."
11:02;11:05;"Jimmy was a good sport, man."
11:05;11:10;"He actually loves the song. He's going to play it next summer on his tour."
11:10;11:16;"The Marik was like basically like Mountain Dew with tequila in it."
11:16;11:18;"The lyrics are just flowing."
11:18;11:23;"Yeah, yeah. And it had that sort of like yellow number five incandescence, you know."
11:23;11:26;"It was like flat Mountain Dew."
11:26;11:27;"Oh, God."
11:27;11:29;"We're really kind of refining the lyrics here."
11:29;11:34;"It's flat Mountain Dew, yellow number five incandescence with tequila in it."
11:34;11:36;"And that probably cost $14."
11:36;11:39;"Yeah, exactly. I had one sip and I threw it straight in the trash."
11:39;11:42;"I've got an idea for like maybe like the end of the chorus is like,"
11:42;11:45;"""You wouldn't believe the cost."
11:45;11:48;"Now, now, now. And the Dodgers lost."""
11:48;11:53;"""It was the worst margarita of my life."""
11:53;12:02;"I kind of remember, I think we maybe we might have talked about this in the episode when we talked about the Dead & Co. show we hit also at Dodger Stadium."
12:02;12:07;"But I kind of remember being there and, you know, it was generally a great vibe with the crowd."
12:07;12:14;"But, you know, because we were there for like four and a half hours, we were definitely like, you know, having to get some food and stuff."
12:14;12:23;"And my memory, which also just struck me as such like a classic symbol of just kind of like brutal corporate food culture,"
12:23;12:33;"was that I felt like when you got a Dodger dog, they just had like the big dispensers of ketchup and maybe mustard."
12:33;12:38;"And like that was it. No sauerkraut, nothing fun to put it on, you know."
12:38;12:43;"And I always felt like a hot dog is such a classic baseball food."
12:43;12:47;"The least they could do is, you know, just have like something."
12:47;12:53;"It just felt like so kind of just like you could just picture like the corporate conversation of just being like,"
12:53;12:59;"""Guys, if we could out sauerkraut, it makes our lives so much easier and we're saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year."""
12:59;13:06;"And frankly, for everybody who complains, most people are just they're happy with a little bit of ketchup and mustard and that's that."
13:06;13:14;"And I also feel like when you get the ice cream that comes in the little upside down baseball helmet, it's also like so bare bones."
13:14;13:21;"It's like you get a scoop of vanilla, no sprinkles or jimmies, as they call them some places, just like no nuts."
13:21;13:27;"Like that's it. That to me, just symbolizes just like kind of like brutal austerity budget."
13:27;13:29;"Yeah, basically."
13:29;13:35;"They don't respect their fans. We could offer the chopped onions, but you know what? It's a liability."
13:35;13:37;"It's not worth it to us."
13:37;13:41;"The nachos are the same way. It's just that sort of like sludge."
13:41;13:49;"Just like terrible. Yeah, yeah. And I think we have a decent number of like Ezra and Jake live event wrap ups."
13:49;13:56;"When we went to see Roger Waters at Staples Center with Ariel, we shared some nachos and it was the same thing."
13:56;14:05;"Part of the fun of nachos is like a few toppings and it was just like whack chips, really bottom of the barrel, fake cheese on top."
14:05;14:06;"Literally."
14:06;14:14;"Another thing I should point out here. Well, I mean, it's really obviously this is like most things, the symbol of our unequal society here and there."
14:14;14:20;"I've had occasion in my life get invited to an event by a real VIP at Yankee Stadium."
14:20;14:24;"They have a club at Dodger Stadium. They have a I don't know what you call it."
14:24;14:27;"You know, basically it's like the VIP ticket places."
14:27;14:31;"Yeah. These places you're getting whatever you want on your Sunday."
14:31;14:36;"There's sushi, there's a taco bar, whatever you want. There's a million options."
14:36;14:46;"And it really kind of says something that it's like the people who don't have like the VIP access to the kind of like really fancy cruise ship buffet type world."
14:46;14:49;"It's not like, all right, well, you know, out here they don't have all that."
14:49;14:52;"But, you know, a hot dog costs five bucks and a beer costs five."
14:52;14:57;"It's like none of the hot dogs still cost like 11. The beer still cost 14."
14:57;15:04;"You just have no choice. It's like even like the regular fans that the VIP access, it's not like they get a deal."
15:04;15:08;"You know, they still have to pay top dollar for like nothing."
15:08;15:11;"For garbage. Just getting reamed for garbage."
15:11;15:13;"For the worst margaritas of their life."
15:13;15:17;"Yeah, the worst margarita of my life. I mean, I don't like going to Dodger Stadium."
15:17;15:22;"I like baseball and like, but like it's a brutal getting in and out of there."
15:22;15:30;"I end up leaving the stadium, like feeling physically ill because I eat like a disgusting hot dog and drink like warm beer."
15:30;15:33;"And then like I come home with like a headache, feeling exhausted."
15:33;15:36;"Every time I go to Dodger Stadium, I'm just like never again."
15:36;15:40;"But then it usually happens like once a year, someone's like, hey, I got tickets. Let's go."
15:40;15:42;"Right. You get way too much sun."
15:42;15:44;"Oh, yeah. It's a day game."
16:12;16:14;"Million dollar man."
16:26;16:30;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
16:30;16:35;"So since the last time we talked, they officially announced the Grateful Dead dunks."
16:35;16:41;"Again, I'm proud to report that for once, Time Crisis was very early on some stories."
16:41;16:43;"Usually we're a little bit late."
16:43;16:44;"We're playing catch up."
16:44;16:52;"But this time we brought our listeners the news about the Chunky Dunkies well before they became a cultural phenomenon."
16:52;16:57;"And even before they were officially announced, we talked about the Grateful Dead SB dunks."
16:57;16:59;"So, Jake, what's your take?"
16:59;17:04;"It's time for Jake's takes on Time Crisis."
17:04;17:09;"Well, I think I said on the Time Crisis thread that I couldn't be less interested in the story."
17:09;17:12;"As we've discussed, I don't care about clothes or apparel."
17:12;17:16;"And I also think I don't really care really either way."
17:16;17:21;"But like it's definitely counter to what like the original ethos of Jerry was for sure."
17:21;17:25;"I mean, the dude didn't even go to his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony."
17:25;17:28;"I think it's lame. I think they look stupid."
17:28;17:31;"Like the same color of that sort of like Ghostbusters ectoplasm."
17:31;17:32;"Ecto cooler."
17:32;17:35;"I could see like a cool shoe with like a simple steely."
17:35;17:39;"Like a very simple, classy shoe with like a steely on the heel or something."
17:39;17:43;"Or some sort of like cool like vans, you know, like."
17:43;17:46;"I don't even understand the context really."
17:46;17:49;"I'm just kind of like a grump over here. I'm sorry about that."
17:49;17:52;"I mean, but it's the same thing as the Chunky Dunky, you know."
17:52;17:56;"It's the specific Nike skateboarding shoe doing yet another collaboration."
17:56;18:07;"I guess what's interesting to me is that both the Chunky Dunky and the Grateful Dead shoe are both ugly in a kind of basic sense."
18:07;18:10;"Neither one of them are just like a gorgeous, tasteful shoe."
18:10;18:15;"And yet there's something about the Chunky Dunky that clearly connected with shoe fans."
18:15;18:20;"And maybe just the Ben and Jerry's brand, them stepping into apparel for the first time."
18:20;18:22;"That was exciting for people."
18:22;18:24;"But the Grateful Dead one, I don't know."
18:24;18:27;"I mean, one thing I think we should look at while we're talking."
18:27;18:30;"I want to see what the fans are saying."
18:30;18:36;"Because I was interested to see that the official Grateful Dead account, which I follow, posted about it."
18:36;18:41;"And I was kind of like, you know, I could imagine a world in which like the official Grateful Dead account is like,"
18:41;18:44;"you know what, we're going to stick with like mostly music related stuff."
18:44;18:48;"And we're going to let Nike and Hypebeast or whoever promote the shoes."
18:48;18:51;"But the Grateful Dead account actually posted it."
18:51;18:59;"So that means you're getting a lot of probably like crusty old deadheads who follow the Grateful Dead Instagram account looking at these shoes."
18:59;19:02;"So I actually did two posts about it."
19:02;19:03;"I got to pull this up."
19:03;19:06;"The first post. Oh, I see Nick. Nick liked it."
19:06;19:08;"I chose to withhold my like."
19:08;19:12;"Because I wasn't sure how I felt about it."
19:12;19:13;"Withheld the like."
19:13;19:15;"I withheld the like."
19:15;19:17;"Throwing me under the bus."
19:17;19:21;"You know, it's really funny when you look at Instagram, just like front and center."
19:21;19:24;"You always see one name of somebody you follow."
19:24;19:29;"Yeah. Liked by Nick Weidenfeld and 23,569 others."
19:29;19:33;"Real front and center."
19:33;19:35;"So here's what they said."
19:35;19:42;"They're here. Front and center in the Grateful Dead x Nike SB Dunk Low is the band's most lovable symbol, the marching bears."
19:42;19:47;"Interesting. I was called them the dancing bears, but I guess a lot of times they are kind of like lined up."
19:47;19:54;"They're marching, which first appear on the back cover of the group's 1973 LP History of the Grateful Dead Volume 1 Bears Choice."
19:54;20:07;"Set in three colorways, the shoe playfully features bear-inspired detailing, such as a faux fur and suede upper, a frayed Nike swoosh mimicking the bear's collars, and an image of the bear on the tongue."
20:07;20:14;"Another iconic Grateful Dead logo, the ""Steal Your Face"" skull, is printed on the underside of the sock liner."
20:14;20:15;"Wait, what?"
20:15;20:16;"The underside?"
20:16;20:19;"What's the sock? Wait, meaning like?"
20:19;20:21;"Like you gotta take the sole of the shoe out?"
20:21;20:23;"So it's like truly buried."
20:23;20:28;"The orange colorway of the Nike SB Dunk Low Grateful Dead release in July 18th, blah, blah, blah."
20:28;20:29;"So they're dropping them."
20:29;20:33;"Then they did another post where they show all three of them in all their glory."
20:33;20:35;"Oh my God. These comments are brutal."
20:35;20:40;"Yeah, so let's look at the comments, because I was curious what the deadheads had to say."
20:40;20:43;"Well, the first one I see is, ""This is not what Jerry would have wanted."""
20:43;20:45;"[laughs]"
20:45;20:47;"Well, here's another one."
20:47;20:49;"""Come on, they are hideous."""
20:49;20:53;"Nike sucks. I wouldn't go that far. That's not fair."
20:53;21:02;"""And when Bobby doubles ticket prices for the 2021 tour to make up for his losses in 2020, you'll need the extra bread to get into his show."""
21:02;21:05;"I love a deadhead using the phrase ""bread."""
21:05;21:12;"""Get a couple of highlighters and some faux fur from the craft shop and make your own like a self-respecting deadhead would."""
21:12;21:14;"And then they got the clown emoji."
21:14;21:18;"I like that he also has kind of a conspiratorial edge to him."
21:18;21:25;"He uses the word ""bread"" and he's also paranoid about Bob being just a brutal capitalist. I love it."
21:25;21:29;"Why did he just assume it was Bobby? He really has such insight into the organization."
21:29;21:32;"How do you know it wasn't Mickey? How do you know it wasn't John Mayer?"
21:32;21:34;"I mean, I guess it's an easy target."
21:34;21:39;"Jerry's a saint. He died 25 years ago. Gotta beat up on somebody else."
21:39;21:45;"""It's a shame Nike uses forced labor from Muslims all throughout China. I will not be buying these."""
21:45;21:46;"Somebody wrote that?"
21:46;21:47;"Yeah."
21:47;21:50;"Forced labor from Muslims? Is that true? I mean..."
21:50;21:51;"I have no idea."
21:51;21:52;"Oh, and now here's another person."
21:52;21:56;"""First Ben and Jerry's and now this? Not cool."""
21:56;22:01;"Okay, yeah, these are mostly negative comments on the Grateful Dead post."
22:01;22:07;"I looked at the Hypebeast post and it was actually mostly positive for more sneaker-oriented people."
22:07;22:10;"But yeah, as you can imagine, some of the deadheads are not into it."
22:10;22:13;"Okay, I have a few thoughts."
22:13;22:19;"The first one is that people are being a little bit hard on them by saying Jerry never would have allowed this."
22:19;22:26;"Because in his lifetime, Jerry famously was okay with some branded money-making schemes."
22:26;22:30;"Obviously, the biggest one, speaking of Ben and Jerry's, is Cherry Garcia."
22:30;22:36;"I could be wrong about this, and maybe we can check in, because later we're going to have Chris Miller from Ben and Jerry's on the line."
22:36;22:44;"But my understanding is that Phish donates maybe all of the proceeds from Phish food to charity."
22:44;22:46;"But I don't think Jerry did that."
22:46;22:54;"And I'm not judging him for that. I don't judge Jerry for wanting to hold on to his piece of the Cherry Garcia pie."
22:54;22:55;"It's his bread, man."
22:55;22:56;"I mean, it's his bread."
22:56;23:03;"And you can imagine that I'm sure Jerry was pretty comfortable by the last five years of his life."
23:03;23:10;"But even compared to the other guys, Jerry still missed out probably on deep money that these guys are making now."
23:10;23:17;"Yeah, so I'm sure Jerry probably felt vindicated, because I bet the 70s were real up and down."
23:17;23:23;"They're probably playing to 30,000 people somewhere in classic Dutch fashion, being like, ""Where's the bread, man?"""
23:23;23:27;"And they're just like, ""Listen, man, you got a lot of people on the crew, dude."""
23:27;23:34;"All I'm saying is I'm sure any member of a rock band in that era, and even today, it's a weird business."
23:34;23:37;"There probably were stressful times financially."
23:37;23:41;"So he's finally making some extra bread from Cherry Garcia."
23:41;23:42;"He wants to hold on to it."
23:42;23:52;"And in the Long Strange Trip doc, somebody relays a quote from Jerry, where he was kind of at this funny place in the early 90s,"
23:52;24:01;"where he was a little bit burned out on touring and would sometimes fantasize about what his life might be like if he didn't tour anymore,"
24:01;24:07;"which I'm sure was a very emotional thing to think about for a guy who's so associated with the Grateful Dead, who loves music so much,"
24:07;24:11;"but maybe at times wondered if the nonstop touring was healthy for him."
24:11;24:18;"Anyway, they relay a quote where he kind of fantasizes about getting off the road and says, ""You know what? I could live off the ice cream money, man."""
24:18;24:23;"And I'm sure some people believe he probably should have taken some years off and just lived off that ice cream money."
24:23;24:30;"But anyway, that's all to say that as a guy who lent his name to ice cream and who was selling ties and stuff,"
24:30;24:35;"there clearly was not an anti-merchandising ethos in the Grateful Dead."
24:35;24:40;"Clearly, they're very okay with fans making bootleg merch, fans bootlegging the shows."
24:40;24:47;"They're mellow, but they weren't refusing to make money off merchandising."
24:47;24:54;"So the idea that 30 years later, the Grateful Dead would team up with a company like Nike,"
24:54;25:01;"which as we've previously discussed, has a kind of crunchy Oregon heritage, it's not psychotic."
25:01;25:08;"It's not like probably in the '80s when they first started using classic rock in advertisements."
25:08;25:12;"Actually, I just saw a funny one speaking of classic rock in advertisements."
25:12;25:20;"Basically, a lot of people talk about the '80s as being the era of people who grew up in the rock and roll era"
25:20;25:28;"finally becoming of age and suddenly being the new captains of industry and the new people working at advertising firms."
25:28;25:33;"And there's a few notable ones like Bob Dylan and the Beatles getting used in ads for the first time,"
25:33;25:36;"which probably really harshed out some of the older hippies."
25:36;25:43;"But one interesting one is there's a Honda scooter ad from the mid '80s starring Lou Reed."
25:43;25:44;"Oh, wow."
25:44;25:48;"Apparently, he felt a little bit embarrassed by it, but he was also kind of defensive."
25:48;25:51;"And later on, people would ask him about his Honda ad."
25:51;25:53;"And he'd just be like, ""Well, whatever, man."
25:53;25:58;"Some of those advertising guys, they show you more respect than music industry guys."""
25:58;25:59;"So he clearly had mixed feelings about it."
25:59;26:03;"But basically, they're playing the instrumental of ""Walk on the Wild Side"""
26:03;26:07;"and just kind of like shots of like busy New York City in the '80s."
26:07;26:11;"And then it kind of just like cuts to Lou Reed sitting on his Honda scooter."
26:11;26:12;"I forget what he says."
26:12;26:17;"Maybe he says something like, ""Hey, you don't always have to walk on the wild side."""
26:17;26:27;"He's like some kind of goofy, like something kind of like hilariously corny for a song that was like kind of like a huge counterculture hit."
26:27;26:40;"But anyway, the idea that the Grateful Dead in 2020 doing a collab with Nike is somehow breaking a sacred contract of like the spirit of independent music and free-thinking rock and roll, that's crazy."
26:40;26:43;"That ship sailed a long, long time ago."
26:43;26:49;"And my understanding is that Nike actually has a pretty decent record these days when it comes to like sweatshop labor."
26:49;26:51;"But so anyway, I think people are being a little bit harsh."
26:51;27:01;"To me, part of the reason that the shoe doesn't really work is because the Dead have already successfully branded themselves so well in the merchandise space."
27:01;27:07;"You know, like with Ben and Jerry's, there's a real novelty to being like an ice cream brand is now doing a shoe."
27:07;27:10;"It's so funny and random."
27:10;27:18;"But Grateful Dead, official and unofficial, they've been making iconic pieces of clothing for decades."
27:18;27:21;"So a Grateful Dead shoe is not actually like that exciting."
27:21;27:25;"And then they're not really what I associate the Grateful Dead with."
27:25;27:28;"Like, I understand that the shoe is inspired by the bear."
27:28;27:36;"But there's something to me when I think about the classic Grateful Dead bear, the dancing bear or the marching bears, they call it."
27:36;27:39;"I love when you see it on like an old Grateful Dead shirt."
27:39;27:41;"And it's like it's kind of got a pop art feel."
27:41;27:43;"It's like real flat and comic booky."
27:43;27:49;"There's something about being like, well, now you have these fuzzy shoes that represent the bear."
27:49;27:52;"I'm like, but the bear doesn't live outside of that 2D world, man."
27:52;27:59;"It's kind of like an uncanny valley thing where it's like, I don't want to see like the fleecy texture of the bear's fur."
27:59;28:00;"You know what I mean?"
28:00;28:02;"Like, that's just like off to me."
28:02;28:05;"And then it kind of feels like more of like a furry thing."
28:05;28:06;"You know about the furry lifestyle?"
28:06;28:07;"Wait, what is that again?"
28:07;28:09;"You know, furries?"
28:11;28:13;"I'm blanking and I've heard the term."
28:13;28:15;"What is it? Is there something sexual?"
28:15;28:18;"I don't want to speak out of turn because I don't want to offend any."
28:18;28:20;"We might have some listeners who are members of the community."
28:20;28:25;"I understood that there often is a sexual element, but maybe it's more complicated than that."
28:25;28:39;"But I think on the most basic level, it's people who identify with furry animals and who dress up in suits to reflect their identity, which could be like a big furry bear or any kind of animal."
28:39;28:52;"And yet when I first heard about it, maybe like a decade ago, I feel like I read about it in the context of a sexual thing, like people who find that to be a turn on or people who want to have sex wearing the furry outfits."
28:52;28:56;"But I think like with any culture, there's probably a lot of deviations."
28:56;29:04;"Actually, Nick, while you're on number crunching duty, can you give us like a good community approved definition of the furry lifestyle?"
29:04;29:10;"The furry fandom is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics."
29:10;29:23;"That really doesn't necessarily lend to something sexual, but I think that it's sort of like living through this sort of anthropomorphic character."
29:23;29:26;"There certainly is a sexual element to it."
29:26;29:33;"All right, so that's a good definition. And I imagine, yeah, perhaps sex is a part of it, just like sex is a fact of life."
29:33;29:38;"But it sounds like I could imagine maybe furries don't want to be thought of as like, oh, it's about sex."
29:38;29:44;"They're like, no, we identify. We just enjoy the anthropomorphic animal lifestyle."
29:44;29:47;"And for some people, there could be a sexual element, for others not."
29:47;29:57;"So there is something to me. Yeah, it's kind of like the difference between enjoying like cute animals in a 2D space versus being like, I want to feel that fur."
29:57;30:05;"I want to see that life size animal. And putting on these Grateful Dead bear shoes, it's so different than wearing a T-shirt with a 2D bear."
30:05;30:07;"It's not how I think of the Grateful Dead bear."
30:07;30:12;"I would respect these shoes more if they were kind of like if they were specifically for..."
30:12;30:17;"Because I'm sure there must be people who are deadheads and furries and who are members of both communities."
30:17;30:24;"If you present it to me that way, I'd be like, oh, well, that makes a lot of sense because there's the anthropomorphic animal element."
30:24;30:32;"Just presenting it as a Grateful Dead shoe, it somehow doesn't capture the world or the aesthetic of the dead to me."
30:32;30:36;"Fully agree. I feel like this came up when we talked about the Chunky Dunkies."
30:36;30:39;"I mean, the shoes should be red, white and blue. End of story."
30:39;30:40;"Yeah."
30:40;30:43;"The bears are the lamest part of the dead iconography."
30:43;30:48;"I agree with you that the early versions of the bears that are just flat and 2D are great."
30:48;30:58;"Even when you see the bears on T-shirts from the last 20 years, they'll add detail and shading and dimensionality."
30:58;31:00;"It just looks bad."
31:00;31:05;"It's not unique to the dead. You see that with other logos being updated."
31:05;31:15;"And then they take the classic flat, simple version and they add drop shadows or something stupid and it's just like, come out."
31:15;31:20;"Baby, here I am and I'm made up of all the sweet."
31:20;31:25;"I can't give you what you want, but you got to come home with me."
31:25;31:30;"And I got a whole lot of good old lovin' and I got me drummin' and strollin'."
31:30;31:35;"When I get up, you're goin' head on and you got to come back for more."
31:35;31:40;"Boy, those things will come out of dust. Ain't nothin' but dust, no, no."
31:40;31:45;"Tell your thang that me like you can't hold it, mama. I'm sure all the hell now, yes I am."
31:45;31:54;"I don't know if I turned this to the thread, but hearing you talk about this classic updating where sometimes a great logo becomes more 3D or something."
31:54;32:03;"It made me think about something I had saved in my camera roll, which I saw on Twitter, which is the kind of weird saga of the Jolly Green Giant."
32:03;32:04;"Oh, yeah."
32:04;32:13;"From 1928 to 2014. And he kind of ended up in a pretty good place. He kind of looks a little manga or maybe like a 90s X-Men comic."
32:13;32:24;"But he really had quite a journey because the Jolly Green Giant, if you look back to 1928 when he started, he kind of looks like a Caucasian Neanderthal."
32:24;32:25;"Right."
32:25;32:34;"He's got kind of a Flintstones like fur singlet. You know, he looks like a prehistoric Caucasian man. His hair is kind of messy."
32:34;32:43;"I don't know if he really looks like a giant, but yeah, maybe you could also imagine maybe a depiction of the Goliath from the Bible looking like this guy."
32:43;32:48;"And then after that, they turned him all green. And then he kind of got a little more like statuesque."
32:48;32:49;"Mm-hmm."
32:49;33:00;"He started holding corn in 1945. He was like this giant green man and he seemed to have a little modern girlfriend in one arm."
33:00;33:04;"This giant green colossus is holding a giant corn."
33:04;33:11;"And then in his left hand, he's holding the hand of a smaller woman whose head probably goes up to like his hips."
33:11;33:20;"That's kind of seems like some kind of weird sublimated sexual thing. In 1970, he became all funky looking and he's kind of cool."
33:20;33:25;"He kind of looks like a character from the Harry Nilsson animated film, The Point."
33:25;33:26;"Totally."
33:26;33:34;"He almost looks like Shel Silverstein drew him or something. And then he kind of got back to being a statuesque kind of Greek God type dude."
33:34;33:43;"For some reason in 1980, he started wearing a red scarf. And now in 2014, he's kind of back to being just a big green giant."
33:43;33:47;"But yeah, it's really like quite a journey. And it's kind of surprising."
33:47;33:51;"Like I imagine with some of these logos, they do need to change him."
33:51;33:55;"It's kind of like Mr. Clean because, you know, it's not just like the MGM lion."
33:55;34:02;"These characters like a Mr. Clean or a Jolly Green Giant, I imagine they were created."
34:02;34:10;"You know, like with some Austrian psychoanalysts, you know, who fled the Nazis and came to the US."
34:10;34:17;"And we're probably like saying like in your sexist society, you have the unfulfilled needs of the modern American housewife."
34:17;34:23;"You want to present your product as being a kind of stand in lover, someone who is there."
34:23;34:32;"So, you know, maybe these characters, they have to change them because they have to kind of reflect like the standard of like sexiness of their time."
34:32;34:40;"Because like Mr. Clean, they've really gone out of their way to be like Mr. Clean is a sex symbol and he's here to help you."
34:40;34:45;"And he is more sexually potent and better at cleaning than your husband."
34:45;34:50;"Mr. Clean has kind of become computer animated in this kind of weird uncanny valley way."
34:50;34:54;"I feel like there were straight up like Mr. Clean commercials."
34:54;35:04;"I don't know if you guys can picture any, but where straight up the implication is that Mr. Clean violated the sanctity of a couple's marriage."
35:04;35:12;"Like, doesn't that sound familiar? That there's like Mr. Clean kind of waltzes in and then there's like the kind of like good for nothing husband who is ignoring his wife."
35:12;35:17;"And Mr. Clean comes in and kind of like gives her like this amazing day and she lets her hair down."
35:17;35:18;"Does that sound familiar?"
35:18;35:20;"I can't say that it does."
35:20;35:32;"I guess in the case of the Jolly Green Giant or Mr. Clean, these corporations who are trying to sell a product, they need to update him a lot to appeal to the people of the era."
35:32;35:42;"Because you're not going to sell any frozen vegetables or cleaning product if the men and women of America don't want to have sex with your mascot."
35:42;35:46;"But in the case of the Grateful Dead Bear, it's not really a sexual thing."
35:46;35:54;"And also they have, like you said, to you, the bear is the lamest, but they have so many classic characters and logos and stuff."
35:54;36:03;"I think what would have been cool and what the Deadheads might have appreciated would be that rather than go for the lowest hanging fruit of the Grateful Dead universe, which is the bear,"
36:03;36:12;"and then kind of turn it into this like strange 3D real life bear thing, they should have picked a deep cut."
36:12;36:21;"One character that I've always felt like is really undervalued in the Dead community, the violinist from the cover of Blues for Allah."
36:21;36:23;"Oh, like he's a skeleton, right?"
36:23;36:31;"He's a skeleton, but he's not Bertha. This guy, he kind of looks like the Crypt Keeper from Tales from the Crypt."
36:31;36:35;"And he's got these red sunglasses and he's got like a shock of white hair."
36:35;36:44;"Kind of disgusting, because when I picture like a skeleton that has hair, I kind of picture the Crypt Keeper, which is like, it's like not fully decomposed yet."
36:44;36:47;"So it's got more of a zombie vibe when a skeleton has hair."
36:47;36:57;"But he's wearing these like interesting red robes and he's playing violin, which is an instrument you don't hear too much of in the music of the Grateful Dead."
36:57;37:04;"So I just felt like that's kind of like an interesting dude. If he kind of popped up and Nike was randomly like,"
37:04;37:13;"this entire line of shoes is dedicated to the Blues for Allah violinist, at the very least, Deadheads would have to be like, okay, interesting."
37:13;37:23;"Maybe they'd be like, we represent his violin in the sock liner, where you see kind of like a bow, you know, like they could get really deep into that."
37:23;37:24;"That might have been a little more interesting."
37:24;37:27;"The underside of the sock liner."
37:27;37:29;"The underside of the sock liner."
37:29;37:36;"I'm looking again, for the first time in a long time at the Blues for Allah cover. It's definitely the most like metal cover they ever did."
37:36;37:39;"Like that, it almost could be like an Iron Maiden cover."
37:39;37:46;"Totally. I mean, it's ahead of its time in a way. It's like Eddie, that's the Iron Maiden guy. This is like the original Eddie."
37:46;37:57;"Yeah, it's 1975. He's standing in front of this like weird kind of like stone, like circular portal with like this deep sense of space behind him."
37:57;38:09;"It has like this almost like kind of Led Zeppelin-y kind of like medieval energy and like the way the font is designed for the band name."
38:09;38:13;"It's very metal. It never has occurred to me."
38:13;38:20;"Yeah, because it's not psychedelic. And even like some of the other 70s covers, like from the Mars Hotel, it's like kooky and weird."
38:20;38:26;"It's like it's a hotel on Mars in outer space. The fact that the words are like carved into stone."
38:26;38:30;"It's got that sense of like metal grandeur. I know exactly what you mean."
38:30;38:36;"I mean, maybe Nike wanted to stay away. They were like Blues for Allah. Are we going to get cancelled for that?"
38:36;38:43;"So they went with the Bears. I don't think it was the right move, but I guess they're not really making these shoes for deadheads."
38:43;38:48;"That's the thing. Right. These shoes are for hypebeasts and maybe some of them will like it."
38:48;38:52;"But yeah, it just doesn't look like the Grateful Dead. It's a fine line."
38:52;38:59;"So we got a major guest coming up. We've been talking about Ben & Jerry's quite a bit over the last few months because of the Chunky Dunkys,"
38:59;39:07;"but also because of their passionate posting about social justice issues, such as the Black Lives Matter movement."
39:07;39:13;"And even before that, posting about the legalization of weed, all things that we feel very strongly about here at Time Crisis."
39:13;39:21;"We're very lucky and honored that we're getting somebody from Ben & Jerry's and not just anybody, the head of global activism and strategy."
39:21;39:26;"And his name's Chris Miller. So Chris is going to talk to us about Ben & Jerry's and their relationship to activism."
39:26;39:30;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
39:30;39:41;"Hello. Hey, Chris. Hey. Welcome to Time Crisis. It is good to be on Time Crisis."
39:41;39:45;"We're honored to have you. First question, are you a deadhead?"
39:45;39:52;"I was at one point in my life. I would not say that I am currently a deadhead."
39:52;40:00;"But, you know, I mean, I went to the Fare Thee Well shows out in San Francisco and I did briefly pop on the live stream."
40:00;40:02;"What was it over the Independence Day weekend?"
40:02;40:08;"That's legitimate credentials. And so you are the head of global activism and strategy at Ben & Jerry's."
40:08;40:10;"That is true. It's what I do."
40:10;40:17;"So does that job exist at most companies in this day and age? Or is that kind of a unique Ben & Jerry's thing?"
40:17;40:22;"Yeah, that's not a job that exists in most places. There are a handful of companies that have people like me."
40:22;40:26;"But, you know, if you I started my career working for Bernie Sanders."
40:26;40:31;"I spent half a dozen years at Greenpeace hanging banners off of coal plants and bashing the fossil fuel industry."
40:31;40:35;"Most reputable corporations don't let people like me inside."
40:35;40:41;"Right. There's probably companies that have something like a kind of head of global activism."
40:41;40:50;"But they probably the track that they might arrive from, I bet, comes more from like a very specific type of corporate giving."
40:50;40:54;"You know, there's like a whole world of like kind of corporate charity that you don't come from."
40:54;41:01;"That's right. I mean, look, there are certainly, you know, companies play in public policy all the time."
41:01;41:09;"Most of the time it's through things like government affairs functions where corporations are pursuing policy that, you know,"
41:09;41:14;"are in their direct self-interest. So, you know, take us, for example, we're a food company."
41:14;41:20;"You know, we might have an interest in things like agriculture policy and we sell our products and export our products around the world."
41:20;41:29;"So trade policy might be relevant. You know, kind of what we do in terms of this kind of citizen or we call our consumers fans,"
41:29;41:34;"our fan facing activism work is more unusual in the corporate space."
41:34;41:38;"There are a handful of companies that do it, but it is the exception to the rule."
41:38;41:43;"Well, so, yeah, walk us through your career a little bit. You said your first job was working for Bernie."
41:43;41:47;"So what era was that? That was in the U.S. House of Representatives era."
41:47;41:56;"So I came out of college in the early 90s and I signed on to Bernie Sanders' first re-election campaign, which was in 1992."
41:56;41:59;"He'd been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990."
41:59;42:03;"So were you already up in Burlington? Did you go to college in Vermont?"
42:03;42:12;"Yeah, I grew up just outside of Burlington. So I was around for and was aware of Bernie's time as mayor of Burlington."
42:12;42:26;"And, you know, for me, Bernie, even before I worked for him, was sort of part of what inspired and motivated me to become engaged in the issues that I get the privilege of working on currently at Ben & Jerry's."
42:26;42:39;"I mean, you know, his whole story of upending the political establishment in the city of Burlington, winning the mayor's office just after Ronald Reagan is elected nationally by two votes."
42:39;42:44;"Right. Sort of threw the idea out the window that voting doesn't matter or that your vote doesn't matter."
42:44;42:56;"And his whole story and how he transformed the city of Burlington really was a kind of defining thing as I thought about what I wanted to do with my career and my life."
42:56;43:04;"I can only imagine. It's always struck me as such a fascinating, magical time to imagine 1980s Burlington."
43:04;43:19;"And as you described, a couple of votes, it could have been a very different story. But it seems worth noting that in a fairly small American city, a little bit tucked away, that you would end up in the same time period."
43:19;43:35;"You would have Bernie Sanders, who goes on to on the national stage, obviously become a huge force. Ben & Jerry's, which clearly you're still connected to today. A small ice cream maker that becomes also a big global brand that is still influencing things."
43:35;43:48;"And also the band Fish that becomes one of the biggest, you know, in terms of tickets, one of the best selling acts of all time. All started in early 80s Burlington. So, you know, what was going on? Something in the water?"
43:48;44:01;"It's something in the water. You know, I mean, Burlington and Vermont as a state, I think, has just always punched above its weight. To your point, it's this small little state that's tucked away in the Northeast."
44:01;44:16;"Most people think it's a part of New York. But, you know, Vermont in so many ways has had an oversized impact on art and culture and politics. And it's a wonderful place. I mean, you know, Vermont was the first state in the nation to outlaw slavery."
44:16;44:17;"Really?"
44:17;44:36;"Yep. It was the first state to legalize gay marriage through the legislative process versus through the courts. And if you look at companies like Ben & Jerry's, Vermont had a number of companies that were part of that first wave of corporate social responsibility."
44:36;44:53;"You know, Jeffrey Hollander, who was one of the co-founders that started Seventh Generation. Alan Newman, who founded Magic Hat Brewery. Will Rapp, who started Gardener's Supply. The employee owned company down in the central part of the state, King Arthur Flower."
44:53;44:55;"Oh, King Arthur Flower comes from Vermont?"
44:55;45:17;"It does. And so, you know, certainly in the context of what has now become more commonplace, but back to your point in the 80s, as Ben & Jerry's and these other companies were coming of age, you know, really sort of led a revolution in the way people think about the role of business and what business can do."
45:17;45:19;"So when did you start working at Ben & Jerry's?"
45:19;45:39;"Well, so I'm a two-timer at Ben & Jerry's. I'm not the only one. I actually, my first stint at Ben & Jerry's was after my work with Bernie Sanders. So in about 1996, I guess, I left Bernie's office."
45:39;45:51;"And at that point, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield had sort of phased out of day-to-day operations at the company, and I came in to work with them primarily on their issue advocacy work."
45:51;46:08;"So at the time, Ben was sort of spooling up an effort that was focused on national budget priorities and the need to reduce military spending. You know, the Iron Curtain had come down, the Soviet Union had collapsed, and we had this massive military budget."
46:08;46:20;"And the idea was Ben was building a coalition of business leaders to advocate for the idea of making a relatively modest reduction in the Pentagon budget and shifting those dollars into kids' education and healthcare."
46:20;46:33;"So that was '96. I sort of rode the wave through the Unilever acquisition. Unilever bought the company in 2000, and I left about a year after that."
46:33;46:43;"I took 12 years away and spent part of that time at Greenpeace, part of that time at 7th Generation, and then landed back at the company almost seven years ago."
46:43;46:48;"So that's, what, 2013-ish, when they created this position."
46:48;47:04;"So despite the fact that this company had this sort of long history of using its voice and its connection with its fans to advocate for progressive social change, there was never anybody that owned that job."
47:04;47:09;"And it sort of would juggle between somebody on the social mission team and somebody on the marketing team."
47:09;47:19;"And so when I stepped into this role, the company wanted to bring in someone that had this sort of campaigner and sort of policy experience into the role."
47:19;47:22;"So been back at the company for almost seven years now."
47:22;47:27;"Wow. Okay. Well, first of all, you might have one of the most Vermont resumes of all time."
47:27;47:32;"Bernie Sanders, Greenpeace, 7th Generation, and Ben and Jerry's twice."
47:32;47:34;"How many times have you seen fish?"
47:34;47:46;"You know, my best fish story is that, and let me just say, you know, I have colleagues who are just such huge fish fans, and I've seen fish a number of times over the years."
47:46;47:49;"But we have some diehard fish fans at the company."
47:49;47:50;"I'm sure."
47:50;47:57;"My fish story would have been in, gosh, probably 1988."
47:57;48:04;"I did a semester at a small state college in Johnson, Vermont, at a college called Johnson State College."
48:04;48:10;"And fish came and they played the dining hall at Johnson State College."
48:10;48:15;"And the campus was turned upside down."
48:15;48:23;"I mean, it was this amazing show in literally this small dining hall on campus at Johnson State College."
48:23;48:26;"And, you know, the show went late into the night."
48:26;48:32;"And I mean, I just I can't tell you how, what a party it was."
48:32;48:38;"And I will tell you that the band was henceforth banned from ever appearing at Johnson State College again."
48:38;48:39;"Really?"
48:39;48:41;"Because the place got so turned upside down. Yes."
48:41;48:45;"Wow. The legendary Johnson State dining hall show."
48:45;48:47;"Someone's got a recording of that somewhere. I know."
48:47;48:49;"We got to track down that set list."
48:49;49:06;"What got this morning? And I had those walking blues."
49:06;49:14;"I wasn't walking nowhere because I didn't have no legs."
49:14;49:35;"But I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right."
49:35;49:39;"Because I got a degree. One thing that you represent, I've always been interested in."
49:39;49:43;"And we've talked about Ben and Jerry's a lot on the show. And we never quite understood this."
49:43;49:48;"So you referenced the Unilever acquisition. Obviously, that's a gigantic company."
49:48;49:53;"I mean, what else do they own? Probably like everything. Cleaning supplies."
49:53;49:58;"Yeah. So they're a huge food company. The second largest food company in the world."
49:58;50:07;"So, you know, Breyers, Popsicle, Klondike, Hellman's, Mayonnaise, Lipton Tea, Knorr, Sir Kensington."
50:07;50:16;"I mean, you know, the Talenti, they're in everything. So food, home care and personal care are the kind of big three parts of the company."
50:16;50:22;"Right. So probably in your average, like Walgreens, they're half the store."
50:22;50:32;"Right. So gigantic company. So one thing we've never been sure about and we've never quite understood is like when a big company like that buys Ben and Jerry's and they own these,"
50:32;50:37;"like you said, these other ice cream brands that don't have any kind of crunch to them."
50:37;50:42;"How does Ben and Jerry's still maintain its culture?"
50:42;50:51;"Because, yeah, I guess like there's a cynical part of me that in the back of my head, we started learning about it was kind of like, oh, yeah, Ben and Jerry's started by these two crunchy guys."
50:51;50:58;"I'm sure their hearts are in the right place. At a certain point, they kind of stepped back, made a bunch of money selling the company."
50:58;51:07;"And now this big, giant, faceless corporation makes money because of the connections to, you know, the crunchy roots."
51:07;51:14;"But really, when those guys go out and camp Ben and Jerry themselves, go out and campaign for Bernie Sanders, that's them as private citizens."
51:14;51:22;"For instance, they made a kind of Bernie ice cream, but that was not an official Ben and Jerry's ice cream because they couldn't use the brand name."
51:22;51:27;"So I guess my question is, well, walk us through that acquisition and how."
51:27;51:28;"How does it work?"
51:28;51:29;"How does it work? Yeah."
51:29;51:42;"Yeah. So I think there are a couple of pieces that allow the magic at Ben and Jerry's to continue, despite being a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the largest global multinational companies on the planet."
51:42;51:52;"I mean, the first thing you should know is that and I'm not saying anything that's not, you know, that Ben, Jerry and others have written about them, haven't said before."
51:52;51:57;"Ben and Jerry didn't want to sell the company. The company was a publicly traded company."
51:57;52:07;"The company went public back in the 80s and they took the company public as a way to raise money in order to build the manufacturing facility in Waterbury, Vermont."
52:07;52:13;"That took the company really from a regional player to a more national player. Right."
52:13;52:22;"And when Ben and Jerry did that, they did something that had never been done before. They created an in-state only stock offering."
52:22;52:29;"So you had to be a resident of the state of Vermont in order to purchase shares in Ben and Jerry's."
52:29;52:37;"And so the idea was that they wanted the community that surrounded and had supported the company for so long to be owners of the company."
52:37;52:47;"And so they had to jump through a ton of hoops, which included becoming registered stockbrokers in order to complete this Vermont only transaction."
52:47;53:02;"Right. And what was such an innovative and cool idea and way to sort of have the community have equity in the business and to fund the expansion and growth of this kind of iconic Vermont brand."
53:02;53:07;"You know, it sort of sowed the seeds for the Unilever acquisition many years later."
53:07;53:12;"And so over time, families and individuals in Vermont sold their shares. Right."
53:12;53:22;"Because they made money off the growth in the share value. And eventually, institutional investors and shareholders outside of the state of Vermont owned the company."
53:22;53:36;"So, you know, when the time came, as Unilever was sort of competing in the ice cream category with Pillsbury, who in the US owned Nestle, Unilever didn't have a super premium brand and they wanted Ben and Jerry's really bad."
53:36;53:45;"And so they ended up offering a whole bunch of money for the company. And, you know, at the end of the day, it was the stockholders who made the decision to sell the company to Unilever."
53:45;53:53;"And Unilever offered almost 2x what the stock was trading for at the time. So people who own Ben and Jerry's stock made out very well."
53:53;53:57;"Ben and Jerry, the guys, wouldn't have had a chance against that type of money."
53:57;54:01;"Correct. They didn't own enough stock to boat the thing down. So it was sort of out of their hands."
54:01;54:11;"But the secret sauce here is the acquisition agreement that Ben and Jerry's board of directors and the co-founders negotiated with Unilever around the sale."
54:11;54:20;"And so traditionally, when a company is bought by a larger company, that organization is just completely subsumed by the purchasing company."
54:20;54:27;"And what we had, which was an independent board of directors that had fiduciary responsibility over the company, would be dissolved."
54:27;54:32;"It would just go away and you would become a unit of that larger company."
54:32;54:53;"As part of the acquisition agreement, in order to maintain the focus on the company's mission and values, the board and the co-founders negotiated a deal that retained that independent board of directors and that enshrined it with legal authority over Ben and Jerry's brand equity and social mission."
54:53;55:02;"And so all of the fiduciary responsibility now resides with Unilever. They manage and control the finances of the company."
55:02;55:14;"But anything that can be construed as impacting the brand equity or that has anything to do with the company's social mission is owned by this independent board of directors."
55:14;55:20;"And so that's what gives us the ability to do what we do and the independence to do what we do."
55:20;55:32;"So when I first started at the company, we were involved in a campaign to advocate for mandatory labeling of food that contained genetically modified ingredients, right?"
55:32;55:36;"GMOs. We were strong advocates of consumers' right to know what's in their food."
55:36;55:42;"And Unilever was very much against that legislation and that point of view."
55:42;55:54;"So it was this interesting position where we each respected each other's point of view, but we were out there working on the ground at Washington State and Oregon in support of ballot initiatives to win GMO labeling."
55:54;55:57;"And our parent company was on the other side of the issue."
55:57;56:05;"Right. Because you one has to imagine that in their portfolio, Ben & Jerry's might look pretty good in a GMO labeling world."
56:05;56:13;"They might have a few brands in the portfolio who might not fare as well when you got to start slapping that wording on the packaging, right?"
56:13;56:18;"Yeah. I mean, I think there are probably a number of reasons that Unilever had that point of view."
56:18;56:39;"But having the ability as Ben & Jerry's to speak for ourselves, to take positions that are rooted in our company's values and to do this work in a way that is, you know, very much respected and supported by the parent company, but not constrained by Unilever is a pretty unique thing in the world these days."
56:39;56:54;"This is very unique and it sounds like Unilever in agreeing to that, they kind of understood that part of what they were buying was not just, you know, a bunch of ice cream flavors, but also a type of culture that would not be in their interest to destroy."
56:54;56:58;"That's right. I mean, I will say one of the other things that I think is important."
56:58;57:02;"I mean, I told you I did two stints at the company. I was gone for 12 years."
57:02;57:11;"When I came back to Ben & Jerry's after having been gone for 12 years, I reckon I knew at least 60% of the people in the building."
57:11;57:13;"People don't leave Ben & Jerry's."
57:13;57:19;"Our CMO, Dave Stever, he spent his entire career at Ben & Jerry's."
57:19;57:29;"He literally started as a tour guide at our Waterberry plant and has worked his way up to the second most powerful dude within Ben & Jerry's."
57:29;57:38;"And so, part of that culture is maintained and cultivated by people who have been a part of the company for so long."
57:38;57:48;"And then, so, can you help us understand what Ben & Jerry's role is? Because you said they stepped back in the late 90s. Are they involved in any way now?"
57:48;57:53;"Yeah, they're employees of the company. They are our co-founders. They have a wonderful job."
57:53;57:58;"They have an office, they have a staff, and they have no responsibility."
57:58;58:02;"So, they sort of do what they want."
58:02;58:10;"They are very supportive and, I think, proud of the work that we have been doing more recently."
58:10;58:16;"This work around racial justice, the need to reform the criminal justice system, and rethink policing."
58:16;58:31;"I think in my 12 years at Ben & Jerry's, one of the most impactful things to me was a recent email from one of our co-founders just saying that the work we had been engaged in recently made him incredibly proud."
58:31;58:42;"And to have the co-founder of the company say that, you know, after everything this company's been through, and the sale to Unilever, to be in a place in 2020, and particularly in these times,"
58:42;58:53;"that felt to me like the highest praise that we could get as a team at Ben & Jerry's, that our co-founders still feel like we're doing the work that they started 42 years ago."
58:53;58:58;"So, they're employees of the company. They do support the work that we do."
58:58;59:05;"So, for example, we've been working for almost two years in the city of St. Louis to close a particularly horrific prison in the city."
59:05;59:11;"Ben has gone out to St. Louis a couple of times to support and work with the grassroots campaign out there."
59:11;59:19;"So, you know, the co-founders and the guys will be engaged in parts of the advocacy campaign work that we're doing."
59:19;59:23;"And they're a very powerful weapon in our sort of campaign toolbox."
59:23;59:24;"I'm sure."
59:55;01:00:06;"It's such an interesting moment because Ben & Jerry's has a real heritage as a brand that's engaged in social justice, one could say, before it was trendy."
01:00:06;01:00:16;"And we're at this interesting moment now when it's not just trendy for brands to dip their toes into, at the very least, the aesthetics of social justice."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"It's borderline mandatory."
01:00:18;01:00:26;"We talked on this show, we had a guest on, our friend Mero, he was making a joke about Downy Fabric Softener."
01:00:26;01:00:31;"Like, he was making a joke about, you know, for instance, Downy Fabric Softener chiming in on the BLM movement."
01:00:31;01:00:35;"Then we looked it up and of course, Downy Fabric Softener had made a statement."
01:00:35;01:00:41;"And, you know, it was unclear. There was some talk about their parent company donating some money."
01:00:41;01:00:52;"But so many of these brands just kind of seem to put out statements and, you know, and some vague pledge to, we don't mean to beat up on Downy Fabric Softener, we haven't done any real research."
01:00:52;01:01:03;"But anyway, it's a funny moment because then you see Ben & Jerry's with your guys' statement that uses way more explicit language than the average brand, such like a commitment to ending white supremacy."
01:01:03;01:01:25;"And it's interesting to hear about the prison work because in some ways that's our biggest question is, in a moment when a lot of brands are, you know, to varying degrees, ranging from like earnestly trying to perhaps shamelessly exploiting the social justice movements, what does it really mean for a brand to be engaged in changing the world?"
01:01:25;01:01:37;"Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. I mean, I think, you know, I mean, I've thought a lot about sort of how other companies and brands have kind of attempted to show up in this moment."
01:01:37;01:02:00;"I do feel like this set of issues around the structural and systemic nature of racism in America, our history that we've never reckoned with, this is different than work that happens on climate change or reducing plastic waste."
01:02:00;01:02:21;"In the normal sort of mishmash of corporate greenwashing and silliness that happens. I do think this is a sort of an exceptional moment in time. I feel like there has been such a dramatic shift in the way people think about these issues in such a short amount of time."
01:02:21;01:02:39;"I've never seen anything like it. Unlike climate change, we're just talking about reducing emissions does nothing. It is true that talking about these issues and reconciling with our past, having conversations is what we need to do. Right?"
01:02:39;01:02:54;"So I think there is inherent value in just beginning to socialize these concepts. And I think, you know, companies are just a collection of human beings. And I'm seeing human beings want to talk about these issues more."
01:02:54;01:03:13;"And so I by no means want to either defend or dance on Downey. But I do think that these companies that were trying to find a way to say something, I mean, I may be being naive here. I think it was rooted in something that was kind of genuine."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"And there was a lot of messiness around."
01:03:16;01:03:28;"And we definitely don't want to create the Ben and Jerry's Downey. Or maybe it's already pre-existing. We don't want to exacerbate. The way I phrased that kind of was maybe asking you to look at it negatively."
01:03:28;01:03:38;"So rather than talk, because I know what you mean. And I think I agree that there is something genuine, probably from the vast majority of companies, even just beginning a conversation."
01:03:38;01:03:53;"But let's frame it positively. For Ben and Jerry's, I get the impression that that's not quite enough. So I guess I'm curious about when you guys get invested in an issue, because also you were talking about the Unilever still controls the money."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"So how does that work? So you get interested."
01:03:56;01:04:01;"Let me frame up for you kind of how we approach the work and sort of how it comes to life. Right?"
01:04:01;01:04:07;"So I think what we want to do is we want to drive impact. So our campaigns are focused on doing things. Right."
01:04:07;01:04:15;"So our campaign, our broad national campaign around criminal justice reform is focused on three sort of primary focus areas."
01:04:15;01:04:22;"One is to end sort of bad prosecutors. So reform the system of prosecutors."
01:04:22;01:04:33;"The second is to end the cash bail process where people are basically criminalized for being poor. And the third is get cops out of schools and let's bust the school to prison pipeline. Right."
01:04:33;01:04:54;"So what we see our role as is Ben and Jerry's is taking this unique set of tools that we have as a for profit ice cream company, the channels that we have to communicate the top world class marketing talent that we have and the relatively sizable marketing budgets to advance the strategies of our partners. Right."
01:04:54;01:05:06;"So we're working with this coalition called to close the workhouse coalition in St. Louis to close this prison where something north and 90 percent of the people in this prison have not been convicted of anything."
01:05:06;01:05:22;"They're being held pretrial simply because they don't have cash bail. Right. And so what we want to do is show up and be in service of those grassroots activists who live in St. Louis, who have been on the ground, who understand what needs to happen in order to get this thing closed."
01:05:22;01:05:43;"And we sort of, you know, essentially turn over our toolbox to them. And so we've done everything from pay for billboards, targeting members of the board of aldermen there to running radio ads, to doing op eds, to providing, you know, targeted Facebook posts, promoting events like, you know, we we sort of bring our ecosystem to bear."
01:05:43;01:05:57;"You're really in the weeds with that. It's not just it's because I think a lot of a lot of big companies, it's essentially like a tax write off. Right. Every year they just cut a bunch of checks to charity and call it a day. That sounds like that's not the Ben and Jerry's ethos at all."
01:05:57;01:06:17;"It is for a couple of reasons. I mean, what we have a Ben and Jerry's foundation. Right. And the company cuts a sizable check to the Ben and Jerry's foundation every year. And the Ben and Jerry's foundation goes over here and supports amazing groups. But it's not coordinated with the company, nor do we kind of take credit for what they do. It's an amazing organization. And we've sort of always done that."
01:06:17;01:06:33;"I think what we want to do with the company is advocate for structural systemic change. And I think sort of philanthropy and charity often doesn't address that. There is a difference between donating meals and working to address the causes of poverty and hunger."
01:06:33;01:06:55;"And we want to work to address root cause issues versus making donations and charitable contributions. Not to say that those things don't have a place in particularly at a time of massive economic crunch. Like that stuff is important. Sure. But let's address the structural issues that undergird these issues that our society grapples with."
01:06:55;01:07:23;"Right. And speaking of that, you know, one issue that we've talked about a bunch on the show is about the decriminalization of drugs, especially marijuana. And I seem to remember even before the current massive BLM protests, I don't know if it was a series of posts or it was tied to a larger campaign, but there was some Ben and Jerry's literature being circulated that was specifically about how racist the war on drugs is."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Was that this year or late last year?"
01:07:25;01:07:50;"Yeah. You know, 420, you know, our brand is always sort of toe the line a bit on pop culture. And, you know, and so last year for 420, you know, we typically run kind of stoner jokes on 420. And so last April in 2019, we used it to highlight the disproportionate impact of marijuana crimes on communities of color."
01:07:50;01:08:12;"And so we partnered with the ACLU on that. And this year, again, on 420, we endorsed and promoted action on something called the Moore Act, which is a piece of legislation in the United States Congress that would do two things. It would legalize marijuana nationally and it would expunge the record of folks who had been convicted of marijuana crimes."
01:08:12;01:08:28;"So, you know, again, even though marijuana use rates are virtually identical between communities of color and white folks, right, again, people of color are much more likely to come into the system through marijuana crimes than white folks are."
01:08:28;01:08:42;"And I can't remember, I think we drove something like this past April 20th, like we drove within like 12 hours, we drove 50,000 contacts to members of Congress calling on them to pass this piece of legislation."
01:08:42;01:09:08;"Oh, wow. That's amazing. And like you said, that element of it, expunging the records is such a huge part of it because it's not really a victory just to kind of like create a new legal weed business if the prison industrial complex still gets to hold on to all these people in prison. It's so deeply unfair. So that's amazing that you guys are really getting into that. I'm just curious, what's the current status of the Moore Act?"
01:09:08;01:09:37;"You know, I mean, it's the status of anything important at the moment, which is it has no hope of moving through the Senate. And so it is legislation that I think in a different political climate has the potential to move. I mean, you're seeing marijuana, you know, as you well know, legalized in states all across the country. And so ultimately a sort of national framework that would legalize an expunge is something that is politically possible in a different climate."
01:09:37;01:10:00;"Clearly, you have a lot of flexibility and really getting into the weeds on specific issues in a way a lot of companies don't. I guess it's one question I have just I kind of referenced it before, but you guys can focus on a piece of legislation. But is there some sort of line when it comes to endorsing political candidates that is like a bridge too far or somehow like not the mission of what you're doing?"
01:10:00;01:10:06;"Explain to me this ice cream, the Bernie 1% ice cream where you bust through the chocolate."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Bernie's yearning, I think it was."
01:10:08;01:10:20;"Bernie's yearning. So Bernie's yearning, we understand that was not an official Ben and Jerry's ice cream, even though Ben and Jerry were involved in it. So that had something to do with the fact that Bernie is actually a politician?"
01:10:20;01:10:49;"Well, there are a couple of things. I mean, first, it had to do with the fact that Ben and Jerry were kind of surrogates for the campaign. And so it just was a thing that Ben and Jerry personally themselves were doing. So it is also true that Unilever, as part of their code of business principles, that is a set of kind of corporate ethics that guides it globally, has a principle that they do not engage in partisan politics."
01:10:49;01:11:09;"So at Ben and Jerry's, we have never engaged in partisan politics. We are very political, but not partisan. But look, this is an incredibly important election that we have coming up in a few months."
01:11:09;01:11:30;"And if you look at any of the issues that we care about, whether it's climate change, LGBTQ rights, these issues around criminal justice reform and racial justice, and it could go on and on and on. There are very clear and contrasting differences on these policy issues with the candidates that will be at the top of the ticket this year."
01:11:30;01:11:51;"And it is our intent to make sure that our fans understand what's at stake and where candidates stand on these issues that we and they care about. So we won't be endorsing candidates, but we sure will make sure that people understand where these candidates stand on issues that are important."
01:11:51;01:12:04;"Right. I see. That sounds very reasonable. You guys put out a statement on Juneteenth very recently that Position Ben and Jerry's is one of the first major businesses to explicitly support efforts to defund the police."
01:12:04;01:12:16;"So now that we understand that with you guys, you're looking at specific issues and dealing with things sometimes on a local level. How do you guys tackle that? Because obviously it's this huge issue. Suddenly everybody's talking about defund the police."
01:12:16;01:12:23;"And then, you know, sometimes you look under the hood and you realize, well, there's a lot of different opinions on what that would look like. So how does Ben and Jerry's choosing to get behind that?"
01:12:23;01:12:43;"I think words matter. Right. And so saying words like white supremacy or defund the police are important, I believe, and I think those of us Ben and Jerry's believe are important. You know, for us, we have been talking about for more than two years, the need to reimagine public safety."
01:12:43;01:13:01;"If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And so asking police to deal with every social issue and social ill in our communities leads to the kind of outcomes that we are seeing every day in communities across the country."
01:13:01;01:13:16;"I mean, I've been working on this issue for two years within Ben and Jerry's here in my own hometown in Burlington, Vermont. I had no idea. I was shocked. Twenty five percent of our city's budget goes to the police force in Burlington, Vermont."
01:13:16;01:13:32;"Wow. You know, this is not a place you would think is rife with crime and that literally one in every four dollars raised in taxes is going to the cops. And so I think, you know, this community has struggled with the opioid crisis."
01:13:32;01:13:42;"There are homeless people that live in this community. We have a massive budget shortfall in the face of the economic shutdown from the covid crisis."
01:13:42;01:13:58;"So I think for us, what defund the police is, is about reimagining what public safety means and that trained armed police officers are probably not best suited to deal with mental health crisis."
01:13:58;01:14:06;"People who are struggling with substance abuse, right. People who are suffering from poverty, people who don't have housing."
01:14:06;01:14:17;"Like we need to sort of think about what are the things that make communities safe and we need to invest in those kinds of things. So that's at a high level. That's really what it means for us."
01:14:17;01:14:28;"Well, yeah, we absolutely support that. I'm glad to hear that's the priority. Well, it's been amazing hearing your whole story and hearing more about what Ben and Jerry's gets up to, I guess, just to end things on a lighter note."
01:14:28;01:14:32;"What's the buzz at the home office on the Chunky Dunkies?"
01:14:32;01:14:41;"Man, I've never seen anything like it. There were a limited number of these shoes and it blew up both inside and outside the company."
01:14:41;01:14:50;"I mean, everybody inside the company wanted the shoes and we only had a handful of pairs that we got comped that we were able to share. We raffled them with staff."
01:14:50;01:15:06;"I mean, it got to the point where they sold out within minutes of going up. And so every time we posted something on social media, it doesn't matter whether it was a recipe for a shake or it was talking about the need to reform the criminal justice system."
01:15:06;01:15:11;"People were all over the post saying, ""I want my Chunky Dunkies. Where do I get Chunky Dunkies?"""
01:15:11;01:15:18;"It really became a phenomenon. I fear that the Grateful Dead Dunks will not fare quite as well. They were announced this week."
01:15:18;01:15:27;"But we talked to a sneaker expert from Complex. We kind of asked him, because Nike does collaborations with all sorts of companies, especially with the Dunks."
01:15:27;01:15:32;"We said, ""Why do you think these are taking off so much?"" And of course, maybe people were responding to the design."
01:15:32;01:15:43;"But he made a case that he believed, and this is as an outsider observer, but somebody who knows a lot about sneakers, that maybe in this case, it didn't seem just like a random cash grab between companies."
01:15:43;01:15:57;"One of his theories was that even though Nike is very far from their small, crunchy college town roots, he made the case that there's maybe some kinship or shared heritage between the brands."
01:15:57;01:16:09;"Do you feel that? When you really picture early Nike, like Eugene, Oregon, Burlington, Vermont, maybe more than any big American companies, Ben & Jerry's and Nike have a similar story?"
01:16:09;01:16:23;"I think that's an interesting thing to think about. If you look back at the kind of Phil Knight and the birth of that company and how it started, I've been in the Nike headquarters and there's this Volkswagen bus that he drove around selling sneakers."
01:16:23;01:16:30;"Ben Cohen used to load up in the back of his Volkswagen square back, pints of ice cream, and pedal them around the state of Vermont."
01:16:30;01:16:40;"It's interesting. What I will say is I was part of the team that got to work on this, which was just super cool to be working with the Nike team to design the sneakers."
01:16:40;01:16:52;"But we were working specifically, as you know, with the SB brand. Those guys are real kindred spirits. They are this counterculture unit within the larger Nike."
01:16:52;01:17:02;"There really, I think, was some kind of values alignment around bringing this shoe to life. We spun off a bit of the proceeds to support some cool work."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Oh, I didn't know that."
01:17:04;01:17:13;"It was a fantastic product all the way around. I would never have imagined that it would have exploded the way it did."
01:17:13;01:17:22;"It's really quite the phenomenon. Well, thanks so much. Great talking to you. Really appreciate you taking the time to give us this window into Ben and Jerry's activism."
01:17:22;01:17:24;"My pleasure. It's been real fun. It's been my pleasure."
01:17:24;01:17:28;"Well, we hope you come back in the future and keep us informed of what you guys are up to."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Anytime."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Have a good one. Nice talking to you."
01:17:31;01:17:32;"Cheers. Thanks."
01:17:32;01:17:37;"Another time, another time for God's face."
01:17:37;01:17:42;"Your eyes looked from your mother's face."
01:17:42;01:17:47;"Wildflower seed in the sandstone."
01:17:47;01:17:51;"May the four winds blow you safely home."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"Roll away, the dew."
01:18:11;01:18:15;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:18:15;01:18:20;"Well, shout out to Chris Miller from Ben and Jerry's. Very informative interview."
01:18:20;01:18:23;"Jake, have you ever spent any significant time in Vermont?"
01:18:23;01:18:27;"I have. I've actually been to the factory in Waterbury many times."
01:18:27;01:18:30;"Waterbury is also the name of a big town in Connecticut, right?"
01:18:30;01:18:36;"Yes. I grew up about 15 minutes from Waterbury, Connecticut, aka the Brass City."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"The Brass City?"
01:18:38;01:18:44;"In fact, in that Ken Burns documentary about World War II where he focuses on four different American cities"
01:18:44;01:18:47;"and what they did during World War II, Waterbury is one of them."
01:18:47;01:18:52;"Oh, I haven't seen that one. I thought you were about to say, ""In the 10-part Ken Burns series on Connecticut,"
01:18:52;01:18:56;"there's actually a great episode on Waterbury."""
01:18:56;01:19:01;"In the 10-part Ken Burns documentary on Waterbury."
01:19:01;01:19:04;"There's a great episode about Brass."
01:19:04;01:19:08;"Right. So there's two prominent Waterburys in New England, the Connecticut and the Vermont."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"You've been to the B&J factory."
01:19:10;01:19:18;"Yeah. When I was a kid, we would go every summer for like a week up to this lake near Stowe, Vermont."
01:19:18;01:19:23;"Oh, yeah. That's like a famous mountain, right? People go skiing at Stowe."
01:19:23;01:19:30;"So it was like then it'd be like a fun treat when you're a kid to go to the Ben & Jerry's factory after dinner one night."
01:19:30;01:19:34;"Because they're open kind of late. Take the tour, eat some ice cream."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"Vermont's dope. Have you spent a lot of time there?"
01:19:37;01:19:45;"I remember a couple trips as like a tween with my mom and my sister and another family we were friends with"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"who had some connection to Vermont."
01:19:47;01:19:51;"So, yeah, I have some good memories of a couple times going up for a week or two"
01:19:51;01:19:55;"and just, you know, being out in the country, beautiful green mountains."
01:19:55;01:20:04;"I definitely, as I probably talked about on the show, I bought my first Grateful Dead t-shirt on one of those trips when I was like 11 or 12."
01:20:04;01:20:10;"I think that might have been in Burlington. It could have been in one of the other like little cities."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"So, yeah, I've had really good memories of being in Vermont."
01:20:12;01:20:18;"And actually, when I think about all the shows that got canceled this year, I mean, there were a lot of ones that were going to be fun."
01:20:18;01:20:25;"You know, the mountain run with Twiddle, but truly one that I was really excited for was playing Burlington."
01:20:25;01:20:29;"Just because Vampire Weekend never really played Burlington."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"So, whatever, we'll get there eventually."
01:20:31;01:20:36;"But next time we play, we finally get that Vermont show, get a Mountain Brews opener."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"Now we're talking."
01:20:38;01:20:43;"In the Green Mountain State. Green Mountain Brews, maybe do kind of like a special Vermont edition."
01:20:43;01:20:45;"Green Mountain Brews!"
01:20:45;01:20:51;"That was going to be a nice little run. We're going to do all like those, that triangle of states up there."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire."
01:20:53;01:20:57;"I got to say, when I was listening to him talk about how Vermont really punches above its weight,"
01:20:57;01:21:02;"one of my first thoughts was, I hope New Hampshire doesn't feel bad about itself."
01:21:02;01:21:06;"I've always really associated those states, you know, it kind of looks like an 11."
01:21:06;01:21:09;"They're just these two very vertical states right next to each other."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"Yeah."
01:21:10;01:21:14;"I guess Vermont's bigger, but I was like, damn, I didn't know half that stuff came from Vermont."
01:21:14;01:21:17;"And it made me want to like, I don't know, maybe I want to be like, you know what?"
01:21:17;01:21:21;"I hope we're not giving short shrift to New Hampshire, the granite state."
01:21:21;01:21:25;"You know who's from New Hampshire? The polar opposite of all this stuff."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"G.G. Allen."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"G.G. Allen's from New Hampshire?"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Yes."
01:21:29;01:21:33;"I did not know that. A hardcore shock rocker."
01:21:33;01:21:37;"Yeah. Oh, you know who else is from New Hampshire, I think, is Steven Tyler."
01:21:37;01:21:41;"Oh, really? Originally from New Hampshire? Yeah, maybe it was some part of his life."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"I feel like that's right."
01:21:43;01:21:48;"Well, anyway, well, I'm going to do some New Hampshire research, but I mean, he put it well."
01:21:48;01:21:52;"Vermont really punches above their weight. I didn't know that King Arthur Flower came from there."
01:21:52;01:22:00;"Now, we talked a little bit in the last episode about this theory that my friend's boss put forward,"
01:22:00;01:22:06;"which is that Reese's peanut butter cups change their formula between the summer and the winter."
01:22:06;01:22:11;"And we've been doing some original research on this and the time crisis thread,"
01:22:11;01:22:18;"it was getting pretty contentious because we have some differing opinions on this theory."
01:22:18;01:22:23;"So, first of all, we had Seinfeld do a little bit of a number crunch on the last show."
01:22:23;01:22:28;"And we kind of felt like, yeah, you can't really prove that they changed their formula."
01:22:28;01:22:35;"There was evidence to suggest that in the past, the Reese's company straight up stopped making their product in the summer"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"because it would melt. But, you know, that's like 100 years ago. So who knows?"
01:22:38;01:22:43;"Maybe it's just the urban legend. But then we get this email from Katie."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
01:22:46;01:22:52;"The subject, confirmation of Reese's recipes. Hey, TC, listen to the last episode this week"
01:22:52;01:22:56;"and was excited to hear about the fascination with chocolate and specifically Reese's."
01:22:56;01:23:02;"I'm from Hershey, Hershey, Pennsylvania. By the way, just to be clear, Hershey's owns Reese's."
01:23:02;01:23:06;"They didn't always, but there's always been a connection. They're both Pennsylvania brands."
01:23:06;01:23:11;"So anyway, I'm from Hershey. So I've been force fed Hershey propaganda and I'm familiar with this topic."
01:23:11;01:23:16;"I have a family member who works for the Hershey company or whatever their corporate name is now."
01:23:16;01:23:22;"And they can confirm from Reese's chemists. OK, so this is directly from Reese's chemists."
01:23:22;01:23:27;"Who would know more about this than the chemistry department of Reese's?"
01:23:27;01:23:32;"They can confirm from Reese's chemists that there are two recipes for winter and summer."
01:23:32;01:23:38;"This is because the weather does drastically affect the shelf life of the product and also how the product is stored in the factory."
01:23:38;01:23:44;"That being said, can't comment on the different tastes. I'd assume they want to have as uniform of a product,"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"but maybe that guy's on to something. Hope this helps. Also, I think Hershey's would be a great deep dive for TC."
01:23:49;01:23:54;"It's a snack food that owned a town while peace, Katie. OK, we definitely should do a Hershey's deep dive."
01:23:54;01:24:01;"But so here we you know, this is Katie, you know, not a direct source, but this is somebody who got a family member works for Hershey's"
01:24:01;01:24:06;"who talked to really with the Reese's chemist. So I saw this and I was like, well, that proves it."
01:24:06;01:24:14;"But Jake, you were a little more skeptical. I didn't buy it. First of all, that there'd be a chemist dedicated solely to Reese's is hilarious."
01:24:14;01:24:22;"I buy it. The over I mean, they would just if there was a problem with the product melting in the summer still,"
01:24:22;01:24:27;"then they would just make the winter product all year round. This is absurd."
01:24:27;01:24:31;"OK, now I'm going to say what I said to you guys before. Yeah, this is my theory."
01:24:31;01:24:34;"And I think this is very rational. This is not pie in the sky."
01:24:34;01:24:42;"You're saying, OK, if they got to put an extra chemical in the summer formula so that it doesn't melt, why not just make it all year round?"
01:24:42;01:24:49;"Keep things simple. Well, I would say to you, maybe that extra chemical that they put in in the summer costs more."
01:24:49;01:24:54;"And it's worth changing the recipe because there's minimal flavor difference."
01:24:54;01:25:02;"Only supertaster can taste it. We're talking about one in every 20000 Reese's fans can taste the difference."
01:25:02;01:25:10;"So put it in the summer. It's worth spending the extra money so that it doesn't melt and then take it out in the winter so that you don't have to spend that extra money."
01:25:10;01:25:16;"That seems rational to me. But here's the other thing. As discussed, the shelf life on Reese's is what?"
01:25:16;01:25:22;"Nine months to a year, nine to 12 months. You have no idea when that product is going to be eaten."
01:25:22;01:25:30;"And do not ship internationally. You're not shipping from here to any places that are in summer months or winter months. It's absurd."
01:25:30;01:25:35;"I don't think Reese's are very popular in the southern hemisphere."
01:25:35;01:25:43;"I can't say for sure, but I'm picturing Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Australia."
01:25:43;01:25:48;"These are not big Reese's countries. I could be wrong about this. We should do some research."
01:25:48;01:25:56;"OK, but one added wrinkle is that Colin, another one of our producers here on TC, he did some original research."
01:25:56;01:26:08;"He found a Reese's consumer helpline and he texted it and he said, does Reese's change their recipe for summer and winter products to stop them from melting?"
01:26:08;01:26:14;"The first text back. No one is available to respond right now. We will get it back to you as soon as we can."
01:26:14;01:26:22;"Then about six hours later. Hello. With an exclamation point. Thank you for texting the Hershey's company about our Reese's products."
01:26:22;01:26:27;"And then a second text. We do not alter the recipe of our products for different seasons."
01:26:27;01:26:36;"This is so weird. I'm so curious about how like this even works. Did somebody spend those five hours like researching this?"
01:26:36;01:26:39;"You could also imagine that they just say, yeah, we changed the recipe."
01:26:39;01:26:44;"It's not like the most closely guarded secret that some of our chemists, they like to talk about it."
01:26:44;01:26:49;"But, you know, when somebody texts us, we're not just going to spill the beans."
01:26:49;01:26:52;"It's more trouble than it's worth. So I'm not convinced either way."
01:26:52;01:26:58;"And at the very least, we know that this is not a myth created by one man."
01:26:58;01:27:03;"My friend's boss, at the very least, we know somebody from Hershey has heard this."
01:27:03;01:27:06;"When we Googled it, there was like nothing right. Basically nothing."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"Is it worth getting your friend's boss on the horn?"
01:27:09;01:27:14;"I think it's his former boss, but I'm going to call my boy and see what we can do."
01:27:14;01:27:23;"Just like seven years later, my friend calling up his former boss, just like, hey, remember?"
01:27:23;01:27:29;"I'm into it. Weird request. Do you know that vampire weekend?"
01:27:29;01:27:38;"Yeah, sort of. OK, so that guy has a show, a radio show. I'm listening."
01:27:38;01:27:44;"You've come up on the show twice now. And the guy's like, what are you talking about?"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"I mean, I am pretty conclusive."
01:27:47;01:27:50;"You think it's conclusive because of the text?"
01:27:50;01:27:55;"Yeah. OK, you know, we need to talk to some of these racist chemists."
01:27:55;01:28:00;"Jake, you might be right that within the Hershey's company, they don't differentiate between the brands."
01:28:00;01:28:09;"But I'm sure there's Hershey's chemists, although it's way funnier to imagine that the races have their own department of chemists."
01:28:09;01:28:13;"Oh, dude. Top secret bunker, five stories underground, man."
01:28:13;01:28:17;"I do believe, obviously, it's absurd that they would have two different recipes."
01:28:17;01:28:31;"But I also don't find those emails conclusive because I just don't think that whoever is making the frequently asked questions at Reese's has the access to that kind of information."
01:28:31;01:28:34;"Like, as you're saying, it's kind of like the same thing."
01:28:34;01:28:43;"Like if you could find the Coca-Cola customer service helpline and you text them and say, hey, I've got a question."
01:28:43;01:28:49;"Has your company ever funded paramilitary operations in South America?"
01:28:49;01:28:53;"And they would just be like, hey, thanks for your interest in Coca-Cola products."
01:28:53;01:28:59;"No, the Coca-Cola company has never funded paramilitary operations in South America."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Would you really be satisfied with that?"
01:29:01;01:29:09;"I wouldn't be satisfied with that. I don't think that the summer and winter recipes are quite as incendiary as funding paramilitary groups."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"But point taken. I take your point."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"I could imagine that they're scared of pushback."
01:29:14;01:29:17;"To me, it would almost generate interest in Reese's."
01:29:17;01:29:21;"What people want from these big brands is just consistency."
01:29:21;01:29:27;"It's kind of like the way that somebody will spit something out when you tell them there's an ingredient that they don't like."
01:29:27;01:29:32;"And now suddenly it's not going to be just one in every 20,000 supertaster knows this."
01:29:32;01:29:40;"Now you're going to have Joe Schmo, when they declassified the documents, saying like, oh, man, the summer formula tastes like dog s***."
01:29:40;01:29:45;"In the summer, I switched to Three Musketeers because I can't stand it."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"You know, this is somebody who previously wouldn't have known."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"And now they can, you know, taste it. You know what I mean?"
01:29:50;01:29:55;"I do. But I feel like for every customer you lose, you gain another."
01:29:55;01:30:01;"It was like somebody's like, you know, I used to really hate Reese's peanut butter cups."
01:30:01;01:30:08;"But their commitment to transparency with the whole declassified recipe documents thing is amazing."
01:30:08;01:30:14;"Consider me a Reese's, a year round Reese's consumer."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"All right, let's get into the top five."
01:30:16;01:30:23;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:30:23;01:30:33;"So this week on Time Crisis, we're counting down the top Billboard hits of 2020 and comparing them with the Billboard hits of 1978."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"Well, there's a couple of clarifications that we need to make."
01:30:35;01:30:40;"Number one, the Apple Music Global Chart, the top five is all Juice WRLD."
01:30:40;01:30:47;"We have nothing against Juice WRLD, but, you know, I don't think we need to be, you know, tragically died recently."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"We don't need to be analyzing five Juice WRLD songs."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"You know, let the people enjoy Juice WRLD and may his memory be blessed."
01:30:54;01:30:58;"So we're going to go to the Billboard charts this week to have a little more variety."
01:30:58;01:31:02;"And we're comparing 2020 to 1978. Why 1978?"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"That was the year Ben & Jerry started."
01:31:05;01:31:09;"1978, the height of the punk rock explosion."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"But up in Vermont, things were still a little crunchy."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"It says in parentheses, May 5th."
01:31:14;01:31:18;"They were literally founded on May 5th, 1978."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"5-5-78, a date that will live forever."
01:31:22;01:31:27;"So just to put things in context, 1978, this is the days between."
01:31:27;01:31:32;"Because Jake, you're about one years old and I haven't been born yet."
01:31:32;01:31:38;"So this is right smack dab in that strange stretch of history known as the days between."
01:31:38;01:31:39;"TC days between."
01:31:39;01:31:42;"The TC days between, because we have a few other days between."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"Yeah."
01:31:43;01:31:45;"Okay, so the number five song, well, we're starting with the Ben."
01:31:45;01:31:51;"1978, the number five song on the Billboard charts was Donna Summer with Last Dance."
01:31:51;01:32:16;"Last dance. Last chance for love."
01:32:16;01:32:29;"Yes, it's my last chance for romance."
01:32:29;01:32:33;"Right. This song has like the long intro before it really picks up."
01:32:33;01:32:36;"I don't know if I know this one."
01:32:36;01:32:40;"I think you'll recognize it when it picks up, probably."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"Wait, what movie was this from?"
01:32:42;01:33:08;"It says it was she was in a film called Thank God It's Friday, where Donna Summer played an aspiring singer who brings an instrumental track of last dance to a disco and hopes the disc jockey will play the track and allow her to sing."
01:33:08;01:33:12;"Did you end up finishing the Michael Jordan doc, The Last Dance?"
01:33:12;01:33:13;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:13;01:33:14;"Loved it."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"You watch the whole thing?"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"No, I haven't started."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"Yeah, I think it's going to come to Netflix soon."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Oh, you haven't watched any of it."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Oh, yeah."
01:33:22;01:33:29;"That would be very TC is that we do an in-depth analysis of the last dance, like six months."
01:33:29;01:33:33;"Yeah, like in September, October."
01:33:33;01:33:37;"Yes, it's my last day."
01:33:37;01:33:40;"I mean, this is like a classic great song."
01:33:40;01:33:52;"And I guess also this song, it was a big hit and it's a great song, but it's also had this like long life because it's like a classic song to play at the end of a party or the end of like a night."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"It's the last dance."
01:33:53;01:33:56;"I don't think I've ever heard this song in my life."
01:33:56;01:33:57;"You really?"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"It's not ringing a bell."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"This won an Academy Award."
01:34:01;01:34:08;"Last dance was included on a 2010 karaoke disco fever CD giveaway included in kids meals by Wendy's."
01:34:08;01:34:16;"However, Wendy's ultimately pulled the CD when some customers heard the words so horny in the song."
01:34:16;01:34:21;"The CD was marked for children ages three and up, which doesn't actually say so horny in it."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"That's so funny."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Did I ever tell you about my uncle?"
01:34:25;01:34:27;"He used to work for Wendy's."
01:34:27;01:34:31;"Really? How did that never come up? Wendy's corporate?"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"Okay, I should rephrase that."
01:34:33;01:34:39;"He designed toys that would be in those Wendy's children's meals."
01:34:39;01:34:40;"Whoa."
01:34:40;01:34:44;"He worked for like a toy designer, but one of his big clients was Wendy's."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"Crazy."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"It's not a happy meal."
01:34:46;01:34:54;"I don't know what the Wendy's version is called, but I remember visiting his office once and he opened up this file drawer."
01:34:54;01:34:58;"It was full of these tiny little fast food toys."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"He's like, ""This is my legacy, dude."""
01:35:00;01:35:06;"What was his background? Is he just like an industrial designer?"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"Yeah."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Was he always into toys?"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"Yeah, graphic design."
01:35:10;01:35:14;"He actually did a Greg Ginn solo record cover."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"One of the records he did under the name Gone, I think."
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Really?"
01:35:18;01:35:19;"Yeah."
01:35:19;01:35:20;"Is your uncle a punk rocker?"
01:35:20;01:35:26;"He's like a shredder bass player, dude. He was into punk, but then he was also really into like Jocko."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"Okay."
01:35:27;01:35:38;"Then when punk kind of flamed out or whatever in the '80s, I think he went funk and Jocko, because he was really into fretless bass and stuff, and never looked back."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"That's a familiar transition."
01:35:41;01:35:46;"Yeah, that's pretty classic. But he comes to all our shows, all the Richard Picture shows."
01:35:46;01:35:49;"Oh, yeah. This is your uncle who used to perform at the Old Town Pub."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Exactly, yeah."
01:35:50;01:35:59;"The number five song in 2020 on the charts is Saint John. I think it's Saint John. It's spelled Saint and then JHN. The song's ""Roses."""
01:35:59;01:36:06;"This is a TikTok song. There's probably some TikTok visual joke dance to go with this."
01:36:23;01:36:30;"I don't have much to say about this song. It sounds pretty good, but clearly TikTok is becoming a real flashpoint these days."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"Did you hear that India banned TikTok?"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"No, I didn't hear that."
01:36:36;01:36:43;"Along with like 50 or 60 other Chinese-owned apps. There's been some military skirmishes between the two gigantic countries."
01:36:43;01:36:57;"So people have been making jokes, and it would kind of fit generally with the state of the world if somehow the TikTok app is part of some type of World War III scenario."
01:36:57;01:37:01;"Wait, there's been military skirmishes between India and China?"
01:37:01;01:37:09;"Yeah, you know, small. I think people died. Sometimes these giant countries, these things pop up and they don't become gigantic conflagrations."
01:37:09;01:37:15;"But there's, you know, it's like some border thing where you're just like, shots were fired at the border."
01:37:15;01:37:23;"These things tend not to become giant full-scale conflicts, but you know, usually the diplomats have to call each other and just like, ""All right, guys, things got a little out of hand."""
01:37:23;01:37:30;"You know, you hear stories like that. But then some people think the banning of TikTok is like a very significant escalation."
01:37:30;01:37:39;"Is that the first example of an app popular in the United States that was, or like a platform that was developed in China?"
01:37:39;01:37:43;"Because it's like, you know, Facebook, Twitter, all this stuff is like American."
01:37:43;01:37:52;"There are tons of apps that are, you know, China, huge country. I'm sure there's many, many apps that have been developed in China."
01:37:52;01:37:57;"But you might be right in terms of popular platforms. I can't think of one."
01:37:57;01:38:02;"And then you have a lot of this debate of people being like, ""TikTok's stealing all your information and giving it to China."""
01:38:02;01:38:08;"And then other people being like, ""Well, you think like Google and Facebook don't do that?"" Which is a fair point."
01:38:08;01:38:14;"I guess it all depends on your belief in America's place in the world."
01:38:14;01:38:19;"The number four song, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, ""Still the Same."""
01:38:21;01:38:27;"Speaking of events we went to, we saw Bob Seger on his farewell tour at the Forum."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"That was actually a really moving show."
01:38:29;01:38:34;"Yeah, he had such a great attitude and the catalog is just bananas."
01:38:34;01:38:37;"Yeah, he structured the setlist really well."
01:39:03;01:39:14;"The popular conception of Bob Seger is not some guy that writes gorgeous melodies, but like a handful of just like really beautiful ballads."
01:39:14;01:39:19;"Yeah, we got ""Tonight Against the Wind."" This one is so good."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"I mean, those backing vocals also just make it so dramatic."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"Wait, pause it for a second."
01:39:46;01:39:50;"I guess I don't fully understand the tone of this song. I've always loved this song."
01:39:50;01:40:02;"Seger says that ""Still the Same"" is not about a specific person, but a composite of type A overachieving people he's encountered, particularly in Hollywood, where he lived for a few months while recording the ""Stranger in Town"" album."
01:40:02;01:40:06;"Seger told Bob Costas about the type of person in this song."
01:40:06;01:40:13;"""They're just very charismatic, but they have tremendous faults. But part of the appeal is the charisma. You overlook everything because of the charisma. That's a gift and a curse."""
01:40:13;01:40:30;"I guess I just always assume that this song is just about like, it sounds like they're kind of describing like some like kind of Hollywood weirdo type, where I just picture this is just like, about somebody, you know, still the same, just like a real solid dependable person. Maybe I'm missing something in the lyrics."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"Wait, start it again."
01:40:32;01:40:46;"(singing)"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"Right on the charm. Okay."
01:40:48;01:41:03;"(singing)"
01:41:03;01:41:04;"What is he singing?"
01:41:04;01:41:07;"You know, I got a weird take. This song reminds me of ABBA."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Oh, totally."
01:41:09;01:41:22;"And just imagine that they were singing, if it was just like a tiny bit more Euro, and just the vocals of like, ""Still the same."" Just like picture the lead singer of ABBA."
01:41:22;01:41:28;"(singing)"
01:41:28;01:41:51;"Wait, these are the opening lines of the song. ""You always won every time you placed a bet. You're still damn good. No one's gotten to you yet. Every time they were sure they had you caught, you were quicker than they thought. You just turned your back and walked. You always said the cards would never do you wrong. The trick you said was never play the game too long. Gamblers share the only risk that you would take. The only loss you could forsake. The only bluff you couldn't fake. And you're still the same."""
01:41:51;01:42:16;"I guess maybe he's saying like, you're kind of like a decent person, but you're living in this like crazy, high stakes world of Hollywood. And you're like, ""I left town, I came back, and you're still the same. Still living that crazy kind of gambler's life. There you stood. Everybody watched you play. I just turned and walked away. I had nothing left to say. Because you're still the same. Moving game to game. Some things never change. You're still the same."""
01:42:16;01:42:31;"Okay, I understand that a little bit more. Like he's checking in on... Here's a theory that could be true. Picture this, Bob Seger comes to Hollywood for a few months, leaves Michigan, and he checks in on his old buddy, Glenn Frey."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Ooh, I like where you're going."
01:42:33;01:42:51;"This is not just classic like TC making up tall tales. I could really picture this. And he's like, ""Oh, Glenn, man. Yeah, it's nice to have a familiar friend out here in Hollywood. I mean, there's some real weird people. It's not like back in Michigan."" And Glenn's like, ""Oh, yeah, man. Let me show you around. Just two Michigan guys."""
01:42:51;01:43:11;"And then he takes him down to like Dantanas or something. And Bob is such like a humble dude. He's just like thinking to himself, ""Damn, Glenn, you're like a real operator."" And like maybe even Glenn's complaining to him and he's just kind of like, ""Damn, Bob. You know, I just miss like our kind of like our Midwestern upbringings, man. Out here, everybody's a snake."""
01:43:11;01:43:25;"And Bob's like looking at him and he's like, ""Yeah, but Glenn, you're choosing to play this game. You know, with all the money that you and the Eagles have been making, man, you could buy a gigantic farm out on the Upper Peninsula."""
01:43:25;01:43:41;"And you can imagine that he comes to LA and he sees like this other dude from his home state. And he's just like, you know, maybe Bob has the perspective as somebody who dips in and out of LA to be like, ""Listen, man, Hotel California is just a song. You can leave, Glenn."""
01:43:41;01:43:53;"And Glenn's like, ""Yeah, yeah, you know, one day I'm going to get out."" And then he comes back another time five years later and Glenn's still just like complaining and be like, ""Oh, man, you won't believe what Don Felder said to me, man. Everybody's a snake out here."""
01:43:53;01:44:07;"And Bob is just kind of like, he's just got to laugh. He's like, ""You're still the same, man. You're addicted to this crazy game."" I think that could actually be what the song's about. Straight up Glenn Fry. And Bob's like a little too humble to ever or just too nice to ever be like, ""It's about Glenn Fry."""
01:44:07;01:44:19;"He's like, ""Well, you know, man, it's a composite of various A-Pay personalities that I encountered when I would visit Los Angeles."" He's like, ""No, dude, it's about Glenn Fry."" That's my guess."
01:44:19;01:44:39;"Yeah. And the refrain of ""you're still the same"" is ambiguous. The story that you were constructing, maybe the first time out in 1978 or whatever, when he's making this record, he's hanging out with Glenn. And Glenn's like, ""Yeah, I'm a mover and I'm an operator."" And Bob's like, ""But you know what? You're still the same. You're still the same Glenn that I know."""
01:44:39;01:44:48;"It could be a positive thing. You've maintained your sense of self. And then maybe five years later, it means something different. I don't know."
01:44:48;01:45:07;"That's why the tone of it throws me for a loop. It's because you picture a slightly more major, happy tone that's like, ""Man, I wondered when I got to town how my old friend might be."" And be like, ""And I was happy to see that you're still the same."" But this has those ""woo-woo-woo-woo-woo"" to that minor chord. It feels heavy."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"It's an interesting counterpoint to ""New Kid in Town."""
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Considering that this album is called ""Stranger in Town."""
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Right. Wow."
01:45:14;01:45:29;"There's a lot more under the hood between the Seger-Eagles relationship. We've got to find out more. The number four song in 2020, this is a big one, Megan Thee Stallion's ""Savage"" Beyonce remix. And this song also got really big on TikTok."
01:45:29;01:45:30;"Thee Stallion?"
01:45:30;01:45:34;"Yeah, with two Es. She's become one of the biggest rappers past year."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"Oh, really?"
01:45:35;01:45:43;"Yeah. And she's from Houston. So to have Beyonce on the song is kind of like old and new Houston legends together."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"That's tight."
01:45:44;01:46:05;"On TikTok, the chorus, there's a specific dance that people kind of do. Usually they slow it down and speed it back up. So it kind of looks like they're hitting all these moves in this really extreme way."
01:46:05;01:46:32;"Megan Thee Stallion, it's like she's kind of defining what it means to her to be a savage and what that word means to her. And she's got all these different definitions."
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Savage is a tight title."
01:46:34;01:46:48;"Yeah. I've seen people take issue with the word because obviously you can think about in history, people using the word savage in a racist way. It's kind of reemerged in hip hop. You know, there's like Rihanna."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Are they like, ""Yo, dude, that's so savage."""
01:46:50;01:46:53;"It kind of basically means like badass."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:54;01:47:01;"Actually, it's very related to like the epic clapback. I'm sure somebody has been like, ""Yo, that epic clapback was savage."""
01:47:01;01:47:17;"Right. I've never incorporated savage into my lexicon. Like I'll say like something is like tight, something is brutal, something is awesome, something is legit. I've never been like, ""Yo, that's savage."" Like, ""Oh my God, dude, I got the most savage parking spot."""
01:47:17;01:47:36;"Did people use that word before this kind of like hip hop version that to me, I'm sure there's a million people used it before, but I feel like Rihanna really made it mainstream, describing herself as a savage where it became a positive thing. Was it used in like kind of like surfer skateboarder worlds?"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"In my head it was, but maybe it wasn't."
01:47:38;01:47:59;"If you showed me like a VHS of like Southern California suburban skaters, like going to Burger King in 1987, and one of them was like, ""Dude, these fries are savage."" I'd be like, ""Okay."" It just sounds like something they would say, but I can't say for sure. Also, I can just like picture it in like an 80s skateboarding font on like a t-shirt."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Oh, yeah."
01:48:00;01:48:05;"Savage boards. I don't know. Clearly, it's a phrase with a lot of history."
01:48:05;01:48:13;"Did they get an email from someone that's sort of like, ""Oh, yeah, dude, we use savage all the time in the half pipes of San Diego County back in the early 90s."""
01:48:13;01:48:28;"I'm legitimately curious about that. Because obviously, we know the history of the term savage and the way it was used as a racist term. And probably before that meant just wild. I'd imagine. I think it probably comes from French. Sounds like it."
01:48:28;01:48:40;"So we understand this new slang term that people like Megan Thee Stallion and Rihanna have taken mainstream. Yeah, but in between, was it ever a half pipe turn? Savage half pipe. That sounds like something."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"Yeah."
01:48:41;01:48:47;"We found a new bowl. Bro, the drop in is savage. That sounds like something."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"Oh, right."
01:48:48;01:48:51;"Oh, dude, it's really fun. But the drop in is savage."
01:48:51;01:48:57;"Or even like, man, even with like bands, like, ""Dude, you guys were savage last night. That show was sick."""
01:48:57;01:49:05;"Savage set. Thank you. There's a band called Savages."
01:49:05;01:49:07;"Savage Garden."
01:49:07;01:49:15;"Oh, yeah. Interesting. There's a Dior scent called Sauvage, which Johnny Depp promotes."
01:49:15;01:49:16;"Very cool."
01:49:16;01:49:31;"Back to 1978. So far, very strong. We had Donna Summer. Then we had Bob Seger. Number three, the Rolling Stones Miss You. Their classic Four Antidisco."
01:49:31;01:49:38;"Yeah, this '78 is popping. I feel like we've done other countdowns in '78 and it's just been brutal."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"I feel like this era, we get a lot of just like AM radio schmaltz."
01:49:42;01:49:52;"Yeah."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"This is such a good Stones album."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"Yeah."
01:49:55;01:50:00;"They've been in the game for a while and they're just like trying to keep up with punk and disco and they really did their thing with it."
01:50:00;01:50:03;"This is the same album as Beast of Burden."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"Oh my God. Yeah."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Shattered."
01:50:05;01:50:10;"And then that really hilarious country song, Far Away Eyes."
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Far Away Eyes."
01:50:12;01:50:15;"I was driving through Bakersfield on a Sunday morning."
01:50:15;01:50:17;"Yeah."
01:50:17;01:50:28;"It's so ridiculous."
01:50:28;01:50:34;"Oh, this song eventually went to number one. This is the final Rolling Stones number one single. Wow."
01:50:34;01:50:37;"Wow, I'm surprised that Start Me Up didn't go number one."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Right, because Start Me Up was after this."
01:50:39;01:50:40;"Yeah."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"It's just a friend of mine, you see."
01:50:43;01:50:45;"Hey, what's the matter man?"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"We're gonna come around and twirl with some Puerto Rican girls and sisters."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"Me too."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"We're gonna bring a case of wine."

01:53:10;01:53:14;"that like introduces, like creates hit songs."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Oh yeah, totally."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"That's what it seems to be, but it's like,"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"I guess with all this stuff, I'm kind of like,"
01:53:20;01:53:22;"I'm certainly not mad at TikTok."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"The idea of like, you know, some random person"

01:53:29;01:53:31;"dance, whatever, I respect that."
01:53:31;01:53:35;"Like, I'm curious about how people game the system now."
01:53:35;01:53:37;"'Cause it kind of seems a little bit like"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"once stuff started going viral"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"in the early days of like social media,"
01:53:41;01:53:45;"you would see like people try to go viral"
01:53:45;01:53:48;"and sometimes with very mixed results, sometimes awkwardly."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"So I'm curious about like,"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"now that the music industry is totally focused on TikTok"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"as the way to break songs."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"And it's not just about like getting, you know,"
01:53:56;01:54:00;"a random kid having like a flash of brilliance one morning"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"about like, I should take that Megan Thee Stallion song"
01:54:02;01:54:03;"and do something."
01:54:03;01:54:07;"I'm curious, like how the ecosystem has been affected"
01:54:07;01:54:11;"by like people actively trying to make things go viral."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"- Yeah."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"- I guess that's what always happens."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"Continuing this incredible streak of 1978,"
01:54:16;01:54:19;"we got Jerry Rafferty, ""Baker Street."""

01:54:25;01:54:28;"He had this and ""Right Down the Line."""
01:54:28;01:54:29;"- Yup."
01:54:29;01:54:32;"- An amazing kind of haunting reggae song."

01:54:46;01:54:48;"Maybe he's just kind of putting on a voice for that."

01:55:02;01:55:10;"The saxophonist Raphael Ravenscroft told the BBC"

01:55:16;01:55:19;"I guess it depends if he wrote the part or not."
01:55:19;01:55:19;"- Right."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- I feel like I read some interview"

01:56:03;01:56:06;"they're playing the stealer's wheel."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"- Yeah, I think it is."

01:56:16;01:56:17;"- Right."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"- It's a major part of the movie."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"It's played inside the movie."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"Like Michael Madsen turns it on to dance to it."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"It's like part of his thing."

01:56:28;01:56:31;"'Cause even now, I feel like sometimes we get requests,"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"they kind of describe the scene,"

01:56:35;01:56:36;"I need to see the scene."
01:56:36;01:56:37;"Sometimes with commercials,"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"you could see like a little mock-up or something,"
01:56:39;01:56:43;"but I imagine in the early '90s,"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"all the time, they'd probably just try to clear something."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"They might just give a very vague description"
01:56:47;01:56:50;"and the length of time and you'd have to sign off."

01:57:10;01:57:13;"I'd like to think it would have a larger identity,"

01:57:15;01:57:17;"where like a song gets fully married"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"to something really brutal."
01:57:19;01:57:23;"Back to the Billboard charts the weekend, ""Blinding Lights."""

01:58:13;01:58:14;"Really, when I think of Shazam,"
01:58:14;01:58:18;"I think of being in a public space, like a restaurant,"
01:58:18;01:58:20;"or I would think the mall, and you're like,"
01:58:20;01:58:23;"""Oh, what are they playing here at Home Depot?"""

01:58:27;01:58:29;"too scared to knock on the door"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"to ask what that cool song they're playing is."
01:58:31;01:58:35;"So they just have to quietly Shazam it from outside."
01:58:35;01:58:39;"Like, eight-year-old, got like a 15-year-old older brother"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"who's just blasting ""The Weeknd"" in his room."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"I think that's where most of the Shazams come from,"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"that kind of scenario."
01:58:45;01:58:47;"- I like that scenario."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"- What else is there to say about this song?"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"It continues to grow on me."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"It does sound like a modern classic"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"after having heard it a hundred times,"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"which I guess most songs tend to."
01:58:57;01:59:01;"Just a solid song from ""The Weeknd."""

01:59:05;01:59:09;"This is more like what I expect from 1978, ""Andy Gibb."""

01:59:17;01:59:20;"- I feel like we've heard this song on the Top 5 before."
01:59:20;01:59:29;"- I think it's kind of like an underground rap song"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"I know had that sample."

02:00:26;02:00:27;"- Yeah, I was just looking at the note"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"that he died in 1988."
02:00:29;02:00:31;"Because, so there's four Gibb brothers,"

02:00:38;02:00:39;"- Yeah."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"He was the youngest, I guess, Andy."
02:00:41;02:00:42;"Maybe he wasn't in the band."

02:00:58;02:01:01;"Was he like the littlest brother?"
02:01:01;02:01:02;"- Andy was the youngest, I guess."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"I don't know, I never,"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"I always thought Andy Gibb was in the Bee Gees, but."
02:01:06;02:01:08;"- He was the youngest of five children"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"born to Barbara and Hugh Gibb."
02:01:10;02:01:11;"- Wow."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"- That's interesting, I didn't know."
02:01:12;02:01:14;"All the Gibbs were born in the UK"
02:01:14;02:01:18;"and the family emigrated to Queensland, Australia"
02:01:18;02:01:20;"when Andy was just six months."
02:01:20;02:01:21;"Well, so who's the fifth Gibb?"
02:01:22;02:01:24;"Oh, his sister, Leslie."
02:01:24;02:01:27;"- I wonder what Leslie Gibb's doing."
02:01:27;02:01:28;"- Did she ever get into music?"
02:01:28;02:01:31;"Damn, and then Andy Gibb,"
02:01:31;02:01:34;"he was the baby of the family and he died first."
02:01:34;02:01:36;"- What year was he born?"
02:01:36;02:01:39;"- '58, wait, he was born in '58."
02:01:39;02:01:41;"- He was 30 when he died."
02:01:41;02:01:46;"- Oh man, born '58, died at '88."
02:01:46;02:01:49;"Harsh, RIP Andy."
02:01:49;02:01:52;"Well, bummer note to end the top five,"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"but that's life."
02:01:54;02:01:56;"1978, that was the music,"
02:01:56;02:01:59;"I guess we didn't really look at those five songs"
02:01:59;02:02:02;"through the lens of Ben and Jerry's forming,"
02:02:02;02:02:05;"but I'd like to imagine that up in Burlington in '78,"
02:02:05;02:02:09;"Ben and Jerry, they were probably just listening"
02:02:09;02:02:11;"to Live Dead tapes."
02:02:11;02:02:12;"They probably weren't that tuned in"
02:02:12;02:02:16;"to kind of like the disco hits of the moment."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"Off in their own little world up in Burlington."
02:02:19;02:02:21;"- They were listening to that Cornell '77 show."
02:02:21;02:02:24;"- Yeah."
02:02:24;02:02:25;"- Only a year out."
02:02:25;02:02:27;"- Trying to frantically spending a year"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"trying to hunt down a tape."
02:02:29;02:02:31;"My buddy in upstate New York told me"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"that they played a show at Cornell"
02:02:33;02:02:36;"that would really blow you away."
02:02:36;02:02:38;"Just like sending a self-addressed,"
02:02:38;02:02:43;"stamped envelope to somebody to mail it back to them."
02:02:43;02:02:45;"Okay, we got one more song."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"Oh, it's DaBaby, ""Rockstar"" featuring Rowdy Rich."
02:02:49;02:02:55;"Those haunting acoustic guitar chords that open the song."
02:02:55;02:02:57;"We've heard it many times."

02:03:24;02:03:27;"I guess somehow that escaped me the first time."
02:03:27;02:03:31;"He says, ""Have you ever met a real rockstar?"

02:03:33;02:03:36;"Oh, all right."
02:03:36;02:03:38;"Somehow I missed that before."
02:03:38;02:03:40;"This is what Genius says about that line."
02:03:40;02:03:43;"In a wordplay, DaBaby compares himself to a rockstar"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"who used to treat a highly accomplished artist"
02:03:45;02:03:47;"as a fanatical admiration"
02:03:47;02:03:49;"or as a famous performer of rock music."
02:03:49;02:03:50;"With this, DaBaby makes it clear"
02:03:50;02:03:52;"that he's not a rockstar carrying a guitar"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"as his signature instrument,"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"but instead carrying a Glock as his instrument"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"not to perform, but to protect himself."
02:03:59;02:04:02;"- Very lyrical reading."
02:04:02;02:04:03;"Thank you, Genius."
02:04:03;02:04:07;"- I think one of the first things we said"
02:04:07;02:04:08;"when we heard that song was,"
02:04:08;02:04:11;"""It's a song called 'Rockstar'."""
02:04:11;02:04:14;"But as soon as you hear the opening notes,"
02:04:14;02:04:16;"you know they're using an acoustic guitar."
02:04:16;02:04:19;"The song really does not care about the historical concept"
02:04:19;02:04:21;"of rock music or a rockstar."
02:04:21;02:04:23;"- Well, unless he's referencing"
02:04:23;02:04:26;"the much-heralded ""Unplugged"" series."
02:04:26;02:04:27;"- Oh, right."
02:04:27;02:04:32;"In this song, DaBaby takes a very strong position"
02:04:32;02:04:35;"in the acoustic versus electric guitar wars,"
02:04:35;02:04:39;"making very clear that just because a rockstar goes unplugged"
02:04:39;02:04:43;"does not mean they rock any lighter"
02:04:43;02:04:45;"than their plugged-in counterparts."
02:04:45;02:04:47;"Well, that's the top five."
02:04:47;02:04:50;"Shout out to Chris Miller from Ben & Jerry's"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"for letting us learn a little bit"

02:04:55;02:04:56;"their global activism."
