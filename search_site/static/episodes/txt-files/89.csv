00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:06;"This is a very special episode."
00:06;00:09;"Jake and I check in with Winter, the god of starbucking,"
00:09;00:12;"to talk about the latest in Starbucks news,"
00:12;00:14;"Howard Schultz's presidential run,"
00:14;00:18;"and Ariana Grande's ongoing cloud macchiato disaster."
00:18;00:23;"We also count down the top hits of 1977 and 1984."
00:23;00:26;"That's right, me and Jake's birth years."
00:26;00:28;"All this, plus a little Imagine Dragons."
00:28;00:33;"This is Time Crisis, with Ezra King."
00:33;00:35;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts."
00:35;00:37;"One."
00:37;00:41;"# They pass me by"
00:41;00:44;"# All of those great romances"
00:44;00:48;"# The war I've felt, what we leave"
00:48;00:51;"# All my rightful chances"
00:51;00:54;"# My picture clear"
00:54;00:59;"# Everything seems so easy"
00:59;01:02;"# And so I dealt to the blow"
01:02;01:06;"# One of us had to go"
01:06;01:10;"# Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:13;"# One of us is crying"
01:13;01:16;"# One of us is lying"
01:16;01:20;"# Leave the lonely man... #"
01:20;01:23;"Time Crisis, back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:25;"Uh..."
01:25;01:27;"Looking frazzled. Yeah, I'm tired, man."
01:27;01:30;"Jake's rolling into the studio with a weary..."
01:30;01:32;"Just world-weary."
01:32;01:34;"World-weary look on his face."
01:34;01:36;"I'm beat, man. We got this beat. Hands covered in paint."
01:36;01:42;"That's true. I got white, semi-gloss exterior paint on my hands."
01:42;01:44;"So, exterior, that's house paint."
01:44;01:47;"Yeah, I'm building, like, a small fence"
01:47;01:51;"that sort of is gonna divide our kind of little patio area garden"
01:51;01:55;"from our sort of sitting area, 'cause we just got a new puppy."
01:55;01:58;"That's the big development, and that's the reason I'm so white."
01:58;02:00;"But the puppy likes to run through the garden."
02:00;02:04;"In and out of the garden, she goes? Is it a female?"
02:04;02:06;"She, yeah. In and out of the garden, she goes."
02:06;02:09;"And Jake said, ""No more."" Why? Who cares?"
02:09;02:12;"Let the puppy go in the garden, man. Is she, like, eating your turnips?"
02:12;02:16;"It's hard to explain, because there's a solid, like, four-foot drop"
02:16;02:19;"from the garden down into this, like, seating area."
02:19;02:21;"It's too much of a jump for a little dog?"
02:21;02:23;"Too much of a jump. Okay."
02:23;02:26;"And to build and paint your own fence is cheaper than just, like,"
02:26;02:28;"""Can't you just go get some chicken wire?"""
02:28;02:30;"Or that's too unsightly? That was discussed."
02:30;02:32;"Too unsightly? A little bit."
02:32;02:34;"This'll be nice. This'll be classy."
02:34;02:37;"You got some friends over for some classy cocktails,"
02:37;02:40;"and people are just like, ""I gotta say, guys,"
02:40;02:42;"""the chicken wire's killing the vibe over here."""
02:42;02:45;"Backyard's looking great, but honestly, what's the deal with the chicken wire?"
02:45;02:48;"I mean, chicken wire, that just would've saved you a real headache."
02:48;02:50;"Well, the fence is not the headache."
02:50;02:53;"It's having the two dogs by myself at the studio today."
02:53;02:55;"They're running around. It's just like--"
02:55;02:58;"I'm just figuring out a new rhythm, because we have an old dog, Marty."
02:58;03:00;"He's mellow. Right."
03:00;03:02;"He'll sleep for four or five hours at a time."
03:02;03:04;"But I have two dogs now. Now you got the puppy."
03:04;03:06;"Can we say the name of the puppy? Al."
03:06;03:08;"Al, which is short for? Allie."
03:08;03:11;"Which is named after? The Lady Gaga character from Starsborne."
03:11;03:13;"[laughter]"
03:13;03:15;"No joke, folks. That's sick."
03:15;03:18;"So Marty is the Jackson, Maine, kind of old."
03:18;03:22;"Absolutely. Old, mellow, and then Allie is the star."
03:22;03:24;"A lot of energy. Hunger."
03:24;03:26;"A lot of hunger. Excitement about the world."
03:26;03:28;"Trying to find her place in the world. Yeah."
03:28;03:31;"Marty's a kind of world-weary old soul, seeing it all."
03:31;03:33;"Kind of a grump. Kind of a grump."
03:33;03:35;"So that's what I'm dealing with. I mean, it's great."
03:35;03:38;"It's a great thing to deal with, but today was a lot of back and forth."
03:38;03:41;"Is it just not worth the price to drop them off"
03:41;03:44;"at the Chateau Marmotte or the Sunset Bar-Cui?"
03:44;03:46;"It's going to be like a daily thing."
03:46;03:48;"I mean, if you have a dog, you want to have a dog."
03:48;03:50;"I'm just finding the rhythm of the dog."
03:50;03:53;"I know all sorts of people who maybe they don't have a partner or something"
03:53;03:56;"and they occasionally have to take their dog to a doggy hotel."
03:56;03:58;"Oh, yeah, on occasion. Yeah. Sure, on occasion."
03:58;04:00;"But, you know, there's just a steep learning curve"
04:00;04:03;"that I have to contend with."
04:03;04:06;"Today you were painting fences, you were painting paintings,"
04:06;04:08;"and taking care of two dogs. Yep."
04:08;04:10;"Yeah, that's a lot. I mean, it's all good."
04:10;04:13;"It's a lot to deal with. It took me forever to get over here."
04:13;04:15;"I'm coming over at rush hour. Brutal."
04:15;04:17;"We are pre-taping, folks. We are pre-taping."
04:17;04:20;"We're going to be transparent about it because we're all--"
04:20;04:23;"speaking of busyness, my schedule is getting crazy, too, man."
04:23;04:26;"You're hitting the road, right? Yeah, I got to go to England."
04:26;04:28;"Fun. Yeah, it'll be cool."
04:28;04:32;"Doing some press, doing some classic radio sessions."
04:32;04:35;"Full band in studio. Yeah, a little stripped down, though."
04:35;04:38;"Like kind of post-John Peel. Yeah, there's a lot of those."
04:38;04:40;"I mean, they have them in the U.S., too."
04:40;04:43;"I remember back in the day we'd do a lot of acoustic ones"
04:43;04:46;"where I'd just be like, ""I can never listen to that."""
04:46;04:48;"Whatever we just did probably sounds--"
04:48;04:52;"I remember on the second album we got a lot of these acoustic sessions."
04:52;04:56;"There's a lot of times like rolling into a radio station early in the morning."
04:56;04:58;"And of course, it's like you want to do it."
04:58;05:00;"If a radio station supports you by playing your music,"
05:00;05:02;"it's kind of like the least you can do."
05:02;05:04;"If you're in town, stop by."
05:04;05:07;"But then sometimes you're on tour and you're tired and you're worried about your voice."
05:07;05:12;"And so just rolling in at 9 a.m. somewhere to do an acoustic version of ""Cousins."""
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, I mean, especially if you're a band that puts all this work"
05:15;05:19;"into getting the sound down as a full plugged-in band."
05:19;05:23;"And then to just do the sort of acoustic translation."
05:23;05:25;"Well, and you never know."
05:25;05:29;"Obviously, there are songs that there could be a richness to the acoustic version."
05:29;05:31;"""Cousins"" in particular was not one of them."
05:31;05:34;"Like a fast rock song. Yeah."
05:34;05:36;"Acoustic."
05:37;05:40;"electric guitar plays"
05:40;05:56;"You will find a swell on the ocean floor"
05:56;05:59;"They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door"
05:59;06:01;"You and the small ones sit outside of each side"
06:01;06:04;"In a house on the street they wouldn't park on a night"
06:04;06:07;"That was a race, take a his was a shoemaker"
06:07;06:10;"You greatest since 2006, the list maker"
06:10;06:12;"A coach and a melody, you eat at the car"
06:12;06:15;"Or you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use 'em all"
06:15;06:18;"electric guitar plays"
06:18;06:29;"Interesting girls, I discovered myself"
06:29;06:31;"If your art life was gritty, you'd be toast in my house"
06:31;06:34;"If an interesting coach, you should be lining the walls"
06:34;06:37;"When your birthright is interest, you could just do it all right"
06:37;06:40;"Me and my cousins and you and your cousins"
06:40;06:43;"It's a line that's always running"
06:43;06:46;"Me and my cousins and you and your cousins"
06:46;06:48;"I can feel it coming"
06:48;06:51;"I rarely post provocative opinions on Twitter,"
06:51;06:54;"but I did a few weeks ago say that"
06:54;06:56;"Nirvana Unplugged was the worst thing they did."
06:56;06:58;"Oh!"
06:58;07:01;"A lot of the TC fan base was just like, ""Terrible call."""
07:01;07:02;"Really?"
07:02;07:04;"""Rough stuff, folks."""
07:04;07:06;"I stand by it, though, I mean."
07:06;07:08;"But Nirvana Unplugged, people like that"
07:08;07:11;"not because they like weird acoustic versions"
07:11;07:13;"of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" people like--"
07:13;07:14;"Which they didn't play."
07:14;07:15;"The covers."
07:15;07:16;"Yeah, they're probably--"
07:16;07:18;"""Man Who Sold the World,"" that was kind of a cool call"
07:18;07:19;"on their part."
07:19;07:21;"See, even that drives me up a wall"
07:21;07:22;"because he's using that distortion pedal."
07:22;07:23;"It's like--"
07:23;07:24;"Ah, no!"
07:24;07:26;"(imitates distortion)"
07:26;07:29;"If you're gonna do acoustic, do acoustic."
07:29;07:31;"What about the lead belly?"
07:31;07:32;"♪ In the past ♪"
07:32;07:33;"Terrible."
07:33;07:34;"♪ In the past ♪"
07:34;07:35;"♪ My girl ♪"
07:35;07:37;"It's awful."
07:37;07:38;"I mean, that was kind of interesting"
07:38;07:41;"that Kurt brought lead belly to the youth."
07:41;07:42;"Yeah, for sure."
07:42;07:43;"'Cause lead belly's sick."
07:43;07:45;"I mean, I am a Nirvana fan."
07:45;07:47;"And that's one of their last recordings, isn't it?"
07:47;07:48;"I think it is."
07:48;07:50;"I think it's like a few weeks or a few months"
07:50;07:51;"before his suicide."
07:51;07:54;"So maybe also they were in just like a terrible headspace"
07:54;07:56;"and that contributes to it."
07:56;07:57;"But whenever I just--"
07:57;07:59;"So you even remember when you saw that,"
07:59;08:01;"you were just like, ""Sucks."""
08:01;08:02;"No, I was psyched."
08:02;08:03;"I was super psyched."
08:03;08:07;"And then I think maybe the way that the versions"
08:07;08:10;"of ""About a Girl"" and a few other songs on that record"
08:10;08:13;"became the definitive radio versions."
08:13;08:14;"That bothered you."
08:14;08:16;"That kind of drove me up a wall."
08:16;08:17;"Yeah."
08:17;08:20;"It sort of became the de facto Nirvana record"
08:20;08:21;"in a lot of ways."
08:21;08:23;"It just kind of pissed me off."
08:23;08:24;"But that's how it ended up."
08:24;08:26;"I'm picturing you calling into a local Connecticut"
08:26;08:30;"alternative rock radio station, ""We got Jake on the line."""

10:18;10:20;"- Van Burry Weekend didn't unplug."
10:20;10:21;"- Really? MTV?"
10:21;10:24;"- It was kind of funny because there's the classic run"
10:24;10:26;"of '90s unplugs. - Yeah."
10:26;10:29;"- Unplugged-eds. There were so many good '90s unplugged-eds."
10:29;10:31;"- AIC. - Yep."
10:31;10:33;"- Lauryn Hill. - There were some good classic rock--"
10:33;10:34;"Rod Stewart. - Yeah."
10:34;10:37;"Yeah, again, Rod Stewart. I mean--"
10:37;10:39;"Oh, actually, Clapton, too, is so--"
10:39;10:41;"That one is so brutal. - Oh, I'm into the Clapton one."
10:41;10:45;"- That's how I got started on the Twitter with the unplugged."
10:45;10:47;"I was in an Uber, and I heard-- - ""Tears in Heaven""?"
10:47;10:49;"- No, I heard ""Layla."" That is the worst version."
10:49;10:51;"- Oh, yeah, I do hate that version of ""Layla."""
10:51;10:54;"♪ Layla, where did she-- ♪"
10:54;10:56;"Yeah, and that's also funny 'cause I heard that"
10:56;10:57;"on the radio a lot. - ♪ On her knees ♪"
10:57;10:59;"- When I was a kid, and then when I finally heard"
10:59;11:01;"the original ""Derek and the Dominoes,"" ""Layla,"""
11:01;11:03;"I was like, ""Oh, [bleep] this is so much better."""
11:03;11:05;"- Yeah, rips. - But I was introduced"
11:05;11:08;"to the Rod Stewart song ""Reason to Believe"" via his unplug,"
11:08;11:10;"which I always thought was a great song."
11:10;11:12;"- Yep. - ♪ If I listen ♪"
11:12;11:15;"♪ Long enough to you ♪ - Yep."
11:15;11:17;"- ♪ Knowing that you like-- ♪"
11:17;11:19;"I mean, he's, like, the perfect dude to do it."
11:19;11:22;"Did the Eagles do one? - I don't think so, man."
11:22;11:25;"I mean, they did an acoustic-- - They did some acoustic thing"
11:25;11:27;"in the '90s during the Hell Freezes Over."
11:27;11:29;"- Yeah, and again, that acoustic version"
11:29;11:31;"of ""Hotel California"" from Hell Freezes Over"
11:31;11:33;"that you hear all the time in, like,"
11:33;11:35;"corporate retail environments is just terrible."
11:35;11:37;"- Let's look up some of the classic unplugged dudes."
11:37;11:39;"- Let's not lose the thread, though."
11:39;11:41;"I want to hear about the Vampire Weekend one."
11:41;11:44;"- Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, there's a Mariah Carey in '92."
11:44;11:48;"- I remember she did the Badfinger/Harry Nilsson song"
11:48;11:50;"""Without You."" - Oh, yeah, a lot of people,"
11:50;11:52;"that's just a Mariah Carey song. - Right."
11:52;11:54;"- ♪ I can't live ♪"
11:54;11:56;"♪ Livin' is without you ♪"
11:56;11:58;"- ""10,000 Maniacs."" Oh, Tony Bennett."
11:58;12:00;"That was pretty classic when there was, like,"
12:00;12:02;"the kind of Tony Bennett comeback in the '90s."
12:02;12:04;"Page and Plant. - Oh, wow."
12:04;12:06;"- As Discussed, Nirvana."
12:06;12:08;"Alice in Chains. And then Shakira."
12:08;12:10;"And then now you're kind of getting out of the classic era."
12:10;12:13;"- Did Pearl Jam do one? They did one, I think."
12:13;12:15;"- Oh, interesting. The Eagles' 1994 live album"
12:15;12:18;"""Hell Freezes Over,"" which sold 9 million copies--"
12:18;12:19;"- Wow. - Good Lord."
12:19;12:21;"Though not part of the unplugged series,"
12:21;12:23;"was produced by the unplugged producers"
12:23;12:24;"and followed a similar format."
12:24;12:26;"Glenn Frey definitely called Don Henley,"
12:26;12:29;"just like, ""Yo, Henley, turn on the tube, man."""
12:29;12:30;"- [whimpers]"
12:30;12:32;"- ""You see these Nirvana guys? Oh, I don't like those guys."
12:32;12:34;"They're real noise. No, but check it out, man."
12:34;12:36;"They're doing--"" - They're just playing punk rock."
12:36;12:38;"That's all they're doing, Don. - They're just playing punk rock."
12:38;12:39;"[both laugh]"
12:39;12:41;"But they're doing a cool little acoustic set."
12:41;12:43;"""You know what? These guys actually got some chops, man."
12:43;12:45;"Turn it on. We should do this, man."
12:45;12:48;"Should I call up MTV? No, man."
12:48;12:51;"We want to have primary ownership of the content."
12:51;12:53;"I like the way you think, Mr. Henley."""
12:53;12:55;"[both laugh]"
12:55;12:58;"- Did the MTV unplugged series end?"
12:58;12:59;"- That's what I was talking about,"
12:59;13:01;"why the Vampire Weekend one doesn't really count."
13:01;13:03;"- Okay. - Because I feel like"
13:03;13:05;"around the time Vampire Weekend came out,"
13:05;13:07;"which was 2008,"
13:07;13:09;"MTV was having, like, a huge identity crisis."
13:09;13:11;"- Right. - I mean, when we came out,"
13:11;13:13;"it was such a funny time, because it was like"
13:13;13:16;"the major labels were all confused, MTV was super confused."
13:16;13:18;"We hadn't settled into this, like, current version"
13:18;13:20;"of the Internet yet, so I remember, like--"
13:20;13:22;"and MTV was cool and supportive."
13:22;13:26;"Like, we did this whole bunch of promos with them"
13:26;13:28;"when our first album came out, and I also--"
13:28;13:30;"I'm sure I've talked about this on the show before."
13:30;13:33;"Briefly, Pete Wentz, who, by the way,"
13:33;13:35;"we're trying to get on the show. - Very cool."
13:35;13:37;"- I saw him at a Neo Yokio event, and I buttonholed him."
13:37;13:39;"I was like, ""Pete, we gotta get you on the show, man."""
13:39;13:41;"He expressed some interest. - Some."
13:41;13:43;"- We gotta follow-- [laughs]"
13:43;13:45;"We gotta follow up on that, but I think he'd be a great guest."
13:45;13:47;"You know, he'll be perfect for--"
13:47;13:48;"to go on one more tangent real quick,"
13:48;13:50;"but because I'm gonna be gone so much,"
13:50;13:52;"we've been talking, we gotta bank shows."
13:52;13:54;"- Right. - And I actually wanna throw this out there"
13:54;13:56;"to the TC heads. Any ideas you have"
13:56;13:58;"for, like, bankable shows? 'Cause me and Jake"
13:58;14:00;"could probably confuse some people."
14:00;14:02;"Jake and I could probably do a bunch of fake shows,"
14:02;14:04;"bank 'em, where we're just talking about this and that,"
14:04;14:06;"and people would be none the wiser,"
14:06;14:09;"but I like the idea that we use these pre-taped shows,"
14:09;14:11;"the deeply pre-taped, 'cause we need a few on deck"
14:11;14:13;"for when I'm just, like, gone. - Weeks, months in advance."
14:13;14:16;"- I like the idea that we use those to be, like,"
14:16;14:18;"""Okay, we're doing two hours,"" or we just, like,"
14:18;14:20;"go deep with Pete Wentz. - Oh, fun."
14:20;14:22;"- You know? - Yeah, that sounds cool."
14:22;14:24;"- You know, like, just, like, walk us through, like,"
14:24;14:26;"what's your day-to-day like, man? 'Cause we've never quite done that."
14:26;14:29;"Like, kind of, like, story of your life or something."
14:29;14:31;"The other, maybe we go deep on a certain artist."
14:31;14:33;"- The band Chicago."
14:33;14:35;"- Two hours of Chicago."
14:35;14:37;"And we can still have our classic tangents."
14:37;14:40;"But maybe some TC heads have some ideas for--"
14:40;14:42;"Oh, I also have one idea that I want to do."
14:42;14:44;"I actually wish that we did this a few months ago,"
14:44;14:46;"where I just want to, like, sit down and play you the whole album."
14:46;14:49;"I think you've heard most of it, but I play you the whole album"
14:49;14:52;"and just talk about it, but almost like a time capsule"
14:52;14:54;"before it comes out. - Oh, cool."
14:54;14:56;"- Before, like, before there's reviews and reactions and stuff."
14:56;14:58;"- Right. - I just want to talk a little bit."
14:58;15:00;"- And here's the thing. I've never heard the album in order."
15:00;15:03;"- In sequence? Okay. - And I've probably heard, like,"
15:03;15:05;"two-thirds or three-quarters of it. - Mm-hmm."
15:05;15:08;"- So there's probably a few songs that-- - Oh, that'd be perfect."
15:08;15:10;"- A solid three or four or five that I've never heard."
15:10;15:12;"- Okay, that'll be perfect. So, okay, these are all some ideas."
15:12;15:16;"TC heads, if you have any other ideas for bankable shows,"
15:16;15:18;"we go deep, let us know."

16:57;17:03;"So anyway, when Vampire Weekend was kind of on the MTV scene,"
17:03;17:06;"it was like this confused era, and the reason I thought of Pete Wentz"
17:06;17:09;"is because it was this funny era where they were about like"
17:09;17:12;"five or six years out from like the video era,"
17:12;17:15;"but people still cared a lot about MTV, so they would be like,"
17:15;17:18;"""Yo, when's MTV gonna show videos again, man?"""
17:18;17:21;"And I think they took that criticism to heart, and they were like,"
17:21;17:24;"""Well, you know, maybe with this new indie boom we can involve that."""
17:24;17:27;"And one thing they did was give Pete Wentz a show."
17:27;17:30;"I forget what it was called, but it was like Pete Wentz hosted a show"
17:30;17:33;"that was all about MTV's newfound commitment to music videos."
17:33;17:38;"And so I remember me and CT came to LA to go on the show"
17:38;17:44;"to present the Oxford Comma video, and the guests were Katy Perry"
17:44;17:48;"and a couple other people, and this is like real early days Katy Perry,"
17:48;17:51;"like maybe first album."
17:51;17:54;"I remember the rapper Lil Mama was there,"
17:54;17:56;"'cause we chopped it up with her backstage a little bit."
17:56;17:59;"And then--I think I've talked about this on the show--somewhere,"
17:59;18:03;"'cause I knew a producer at MTV who told me how one segment they did"
18:03;18:06;"was 'cause Lil Wayne was there, was they showed him all the videos of the day,"
18:06;18:09;"and that--I still don't know if this is true. I gotta check in with this dude."
18:09;18:12;"- And they're filming this. - Yeah, but they didn't air it."
18:12;18:16;"So somewhere at MTV, supposedly, there's video of Lil Wayne"
18:16;18:19;"watching and reacting in real time to the Oxford Comma video."
18:19;18:23;"And supposedly, according to this guy, Lil Wayne--'cause that's a one-shot video"
18:23;18:25;"directed by Richard Ayoade. Shout out to him."
18:25;18:28;"Lil Wayne watched, and he was like, ""Whoa, that whole thing was one shot?"""
18:28;18:30;"Not that we invented that or anything, but he was watching that,"
18:30;18:32;"and he's like, ""That's one shot?"" He's like, ""Yeah, that's cool."
18:32;18:35;"I wanna do something like that."" And then shortly thereafter,"
18:35;18:38;"he made a video for his song that was huge at the time called ""A Milli,"""
18:38;18:40;"and that was a one-shot video."
18:40;18:42;"So supposedly, it was inspired by Oxford Comma."
18:42;18:44;"I gotta--we gotta track down this footage. I just wanna know--"
18:44;18:47;"- It's a direct linkage. - I wanna know what he was saying."
18:47;18:50;"So there was that, and then I remember maybe on the second album,"
18:50;18:52;"they were trying to bring back ""Unplugged."""
18:52;18:55;"So that's why I don't count it as part--it's not part of the classic ""Unplugged"" run."
18:55;18:58;"- This was kind of like-- - It was branded as MTV Unplugged."
18:58;19:01;"It was branded as MTV Unplugged, but you could just tell it was like--"
19:01;19:03;"you know, it wasn't the same crew."
19:03;19:05;"So it was material from the first two records?"
19:05;19:08;"Yeah, it exists somewhere. I also remember being there and just being, like,"
19:08;19:10;"really burned out, and we were doing an acoustic thing."
19:10;19:12;"And I think we had, like, some, you know, string section come,"
19:12;19:14;"and we tried to spruce it up."
19:14;19:17;"But I have this memory of kind of ripping into A-Punk, like, on an acoustic."
19:17;19:19;"[singing]"
19:19;19:21;"And then I'd just be like, ""Joanna drove Sully into the--"""
19:21;19:23;"And I was like, ""Whoa."""
19:23;19:26;"You know, and it's not live, so I was like--kind of, like, forgot the lyrics."
19:26;19:28;"And then I had this, like, weird brain meltdown for, like, four minutes,"
19:28;19:31;"where I started three times, and I just couldn't get the lyrics right."
19:31;19:33;"- Really? - Yeah, it was strange."
19:33;19:35;"Has that happened before or since?"
19:35;19:38;"Yeah, my mind--one thing I've realized is if I can't let my mind wander,"
19:38;19:40;"I will mess up the lyrics."
19:40;19:42;"Even if I start thinking too much about, like, the sound of the band"
19:42;19:45;"or my guitar playing, you know, my mind will wander."
19:45;19:48;"Because sometimes you just, like--I'm just singing, and then I'm like,"
19:48;19:51;"""Whoa,"" I can snap back into it. It's like I was gone."
19:51;19:53;"- Yeah, yeah. - You know, so I might mess up a word or two."
19:53;19:56;"- Sure, and just keep going. - Or start the wrong phrase."
19:56;19:58;"Like, I might just hit the wrong-- [singing]"
19:58;20:00;"- And kind of get back in. - Yeah."
20:00;20:02;"- This was unusual. - Wow."
20:02;20:04;"Maybe because it was a TV show, I was more in my head or something."
20:04;20:07;"And was there, like, a studio audience watching you, like--"
20:07;20:09;"- Yeah. - --have all these false starts?"
20:09;20:11;"Yeah, and I was just like, ""Sorry, guys."""
20:11;20:13;"And were the other guys in the band like, ""No, the lyrics are this,"""
20:13;20:15;"- or they don't know the lyrics? - Yeah, no, no, I think--yeah,"
20:15;20:17;"I feel like I was getting some assistance."
20:17;20:20;"Oh, man. That makes me think of, like, when, like, Second Baseman,"
20:20;20:22;"like, all of a sudden can't throw to first base."
20:22;20:24;"- Yeah, it's just a mind game. - This happens every now and then."
20:24;20:26;"- Yeah, they're just getting to it. - Or, like, in tennis,"
20:26;20:28;"like, somebody just wails two serves into the net."
20:28;20:31;"Yeah, I mean, I'm talking about, like, this happens where, like,"
20:31;20:34;"some sort of switch is flipped, and, like, a catcher"
20:34;20:36;"loses the ability to throw back to the pitcher."
20:36;20:38;"- Forever? - Oh, no, it's ruined careers."
20:38;20:40;"I mean, it's rare, but it does happen."
20:40;20:42;"Can't throw back to the pitcher?"
20:42;20:44;"It becomes, like, a mental thing of, like--"
20:44;20:46;"- they just become so psyched out. - Really?"
20:46;20:49;"It happened famously to Chuck Knobloch, who was a second baseman."
20:49;20:51;"- Uh-huh. - And, like, he stopped being able"
20:51;20:53;"to throw to first base during routine plays."
20:53;20:55;"And there was nothing physically wrong with his arm?"
20:55;20:57;"- No, no, it was just mental. - Whoa."
20:57;20:59;"It was, like, the most basic thing you can do."
20:59;21:01;"- So, it's going in other directions? - Yeah, presumably."
21:01;21:04;"I mean, that's why sports psychology is a real industry."
21:04;21:06;"Hopefully that doesn't happen to you this tour."
21:06;21:08;"Oh, wait, I'm reading about it."
21:08;21:10;"""During the summer of 2009, MTV.com"

22:16;22:18;"I don't know Paramore or All Time Low."

22:26;22:28;"10,000 Maniacs."
22:28;22:31;"I heard a song of theirs the other day that reminded me so much of Vampire."
22:31;22:33;"Really?"
22:33;22:36;"Yeah, if you bring up 10,000 Maniacs, it's not their biggest song."
22:36;22:38;"It was probably their second biggest song."
22:38;22:40;"And this is the band that Natalie Merchant was the singer of?"
22:40;22:42;"Yeah, they're like an upstate New York..."
22:42;22:44;"Oh, right, they did Because the Night."
22:44;22:46;"I like The Weather is the one that reminds me of Vampire."
22:46;22:50;"Wow, 10,000 Maniacs, MTV Unplugged, sold 2.3 million."
22:50;22:51;"Wow."
22:51;22:52;"That's wild."
22:52;22:54;"Collapsed it and sold 7.7."
22:54;23:05;"This part reminded me of early Vampire."
23:05;23:07;"It's a cool song."
23:07;23:14;"# If my head found me pillow land and fall again"
23:14;23:21;"# Shivering my bones just thinking about the weather"
23:21;23:28;"# Quivering my lip as if I might cry"

23:45;23:47;"Oh, wow."
23:47;23:49;"Yeah, I don't know much about them."
23:49;23:54;"And then what were the big Natalie Merchant songs?"
23:54;23:58;"Oh, yeah."
23:58;24:04;"Yeah, this is more like kind of coffee shop, like feel good."
24:04;24:07;"Although actually, this is like a little crunchier than I remember."
24:07;24:09;"That guitar like going wild."
24:09;24:20;"# Doctors have come from distant cities just to see me"
24:20;24:28;"# Stand over my bed disbelieving what they see"
24:28;24:36;"# They say I must be wonder, no wonder, that's on creation"
24:36;24:43;"# And as far as they see they can offer no explanation"
24:43;24:46;"Good vibe."
24:46;24:50;"Must have been a bummer for the band"
24:50;24:54;"because I feel like she hit her kind of commercial peak going solo."
24:54;24:55;"Yeah."
24:55;24:57;"I wonder what the backstory there was."
24:57;25:03;"# Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
25:03;25:07;"# Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah"
25:07;25:10;"# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
25:10;25:11;"Oh, yeah, this one."
25:11;25:13;"# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la"
25:13;25:18;"See, this stuff is kind of like adjacent to like Paula Cole or something."
25:18;25:20;"Oh, yeah, I might have my timing wrong,"
25:20;25:22;"but I feel like Natalie Merchant really like paved the way"
25:22;25:25;"for the Paula Coles and the Sarah McLachlans,"
25:25;25:27;"the whole Lilith Fair crew."
25:27;25:31;"I feel like Natalie Merchant was a contemporary with Sarah McLachlan."
25:31;25:33;"Is it McLaughlin or McGlocklin?"
25:33;25:34;"I always said McGlocklin."
25:34;25:35;"McGlocklin, OK."
25:35;25:38;"# I don't know, keep on giving"
25:38;25:41;"But that 10,000 Maniac song from '87, I was like,"
25:41;25:42;"I heard it the other day and I was like,"
25:42;25:45;"oh, this is like a little vibe-ier."
25:45;25:51;"# For your selflessness"
25:52;25:55;"# My admiration"
25:55;25:57;"Although I have to say, I'm pretty done with this."
25:57;25:59;"Oh, this Natalie Merchant stuff, actually,"
25:59;26:01;"I haven't heard it in 15, 20 years."
26:01;26:03;"It's a little vibe-ier than I remember."
26:03;26:04;"Yeah."

26:31;26:32;"- What year?"
26:32;26:33;"- Well, this came out in '98."

26:35;26:36;"- Okay."
26:36;26:37;"McLachlan."

35:47;35:48;"Love talking to you guys."
35:48;35:50;"How are you, Jake, Ezra?"

35:54;35:55;"you're getting up there for maybe"
35:55;35:58;"one of our all-time most frequent guests."
35:58;36:01;"- Well, you gentlemen do talk about Starbucks quite a bit."
36:01;36:03;"I've been working my way backwards"
36:03;36:06;"through Time Crisis episodes,"
36:06;36:09;"and boy, I've been missing some great stuff."
36:09;36:11;"- Well, and part of the reason we wanted to call you"
36:11;36:13;"is because, as always, Starbucks is in the news,"
36:13;36:15;"maybe now more than ever."
36:15;36:17;"- I think they're always in the news."
36:17;36:18;"- That's true."
36:18;36:21;"I guess to start, Howard Schultz running for president."
36:21;36:22;"I mean, what is going on, man?"
36:22;36:23;"- I've been thinking about it"
36:23;36:25;"since you talked about it recently,"
36:25;36:28;"and the fact is, I don't know if he can win,"
36:28;36:30;"so I didn't think about it too much"
36:30;36:32;"when the announcement originally came out,"
36:32;36:34;"but then he went and gave that interview"
36:34;36:37;"where he said that we can't afford healthcare for all,"
36:37;36:39;"and he lost me right there."
36:39;36:41;"No billionaire should be telling the American people"
36:41;36:43;"that they can't afford healthcare"
36:43;36:44;"when he can afford the best healthcare"
36:44;36:46;"for himself and his family that he wants."
36:46;36:47;"- Right on."
36:47;36:48;"- Yeah, I agree."
36:48;36:49;"- I mean, what's he thinking?"
36:49;36:52;"- I mean, he used to seem like a relatively chill dude."
36:52;36:54;"Like, I feel like I saw a tweet or something a while ago"
36:54;36:56;"where somebody said people were getting excited"
36:56;36:59;"about a candidate, maybe even somebody we love like Bernie,"
36:59;37:01;"and somebody said, you know, like, whatever, that's cool,"
37:01;37:02;"but just keep in mind,"
37:02;37:04;"anybody who actually runs for president is insane,"
37:04;37:06;"and you know, I would cut Bernie some slack"
37:06;37:07;"and some of these people"
37:07;37:10;"who have truly been public servants for decades."
37:10;37:11;"At least that's as good as it gets"
37:11;37:12;"where you're kind of like, okay,"
37:12;37:14;"you've been doing your thing for a while,"
37:14;37:15;"but these people just throwing their hats in the ring."
37:15;37:17;"I wanna be president."
37:17;37:19;"It's really bonkers, and also--"
37:19;37:19;"- It's embarrassing."
37:19;37:22;"- Howard Schultz is just destroying his legacy in a way."
37:22;37:26;"- Well, he's certainly got people riled up, that's for sure,"
37:26;37:28;"and he's not doing Starbucks any favors."
37:28;37:31;"- So Winter, I mean, you've been in and out of Starbucks"
37:31;37:33;"nonstop the last few months, I'm assuming."
37:33;37:35;"Have you talked to anyone at the stores about it at all?"
37:35;37:36;"Has it come up?"
37:36;37:38;"- It has not come up at the stores."
37:38;37:41;"I've only read about it online, and as a matter of fact,"
37:41;37:44;"I haven't been in and out of Starbucks that much."
37:44;37:47;"I had a bit of a crisis myself with my family"
37:47;37:51;"after I spoke to you guys in LA."
37:51;37:51;"- Oh, man."
37:51;37:55;"- And I've sort of had to take care of my mother,"
37:55;37:58;"and that has put a real damper on my Starbucks-ing,"
37:58;38:01;"and I've basically been working since last year"
38:01;38:03;"to help pay for her care."
38:03;38:05;"But I'm hoping to get back on the road"
38:05;38:07;"either later this year across the pond"
38:07;38:10;"and hit some Asian and European stores,"
38:10;38:13;"or maybe next year, just I need to save up enough"
38:13;38:15;"to ensure that she's well taken care of."
38:15;38:17;"And I've been focusing on Scrabble too"
38:17;38:18;"while I'm out here on the East Coast working"
38:18;38:21;"because this is a hub of tournament Scrabble,"
38:21;38:23;"trying to get up to master ranking."
38:23;38:24;"- Well, first of all, I hope everyone's all right,"
38:24;38:26;"and I hope that you can be back to--"
38:26;38:27;"- Sorry to hear that."
38:27;38:28;"- Yeah, sorry to hear that,"
38:28;38:29;"and I hope that your mom's all right"
38:29;38:31;"and you can be back to Starbucks-ing soon."
38:31;38:33;"But back to the Scrabble, though, for a second."
38:33;38:36;"Can you just prepare by playing online Scrabble,"
38:36;38:38;"or do you have to do something even more extreme?"
38:38;38:39;"- There have been some players"
38:39;38:43;"who have played online Scrabble exclusively"
38:43;38:46;"because they don't have access to their live opponents,"
38:46;38:48;"and then they'll show up at a tournament"
38:48;38:49;"and they'll do all right."
38:49;38:50;"But I only play over the board."
38:50;38:51;"I never play online."
38:51;38:53;"- Interesting."
38:53;38:56;"So Howard Schultz, he lost you with his policy."
38:56;38:57;"I already saw he had some quote the other day,"
38:57;38:59;"the kind of corny thing where he said"
38:59;39:01;"how Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi"
39:01;39:02;"can't even be in the same room as each other."
39:02;39:04;"They hate each other,"
39:04;39:06;"which obviously they've still been in the same room."
39:06;39:08;"And he said, ""We can't have a country like that."
39:08;39:10;"""Whereas me, I'll have everybody come visit me"
39:10;39:13;"""in the office and we'll talk things over over some coffee."""
39:13;39:14;"- He's a great deal maker."
39:14;39:17;"- Some Starbucks coffee he went out of his way to point out."
39:17;39:20;"I mean, I know Schultz probably thinks he's the anti-Trump,"
39:20;39:21;"but come on, man."
39:21;39:21;"- Look in the mirror, bro."
39:21;39:22;"- Look in the mirror."
39:22;39:24;"- Yeah, he has a little bit too much money."
39:24;39:26;"- Although I do have one question for you, Winter."
39:26;39:28;"Part of the reason, as I recall,"
39:28;39:30;"that you got into Starbucking in the first place"
39:30;39:33;"back in the '90s was 'cause when you first started"
39:33;39:35;"experiencing Starbucks, you were impressed"
39:35;39:39;"by how they were run, how the business was run,"
39:39;39:40;"and the general vibe of the stores."
39:40;39:41;"Is that true?"
39:41;39:42;"- That's correct."
39:42;39:45;"And the consistency of the coffee."
39:45;39:48;"20 years ago, it really was some of the best coffee"
39:48;39:50;"that you could find in most cities in America."
39:50;39:54;"Recently, y'all were talking about Omaha, for example,"
39:54;39:55;"and how you can get Nitro."
39:55;39:57;"Good coffee in Omaha now?"
39:57;39:57;"- Yeah."
39:57;39:59;"- 20 years ago, I don't know that you could've gotten"
39:59;40:01;"good coffee in Omaha."
40:01;40:02;"- Starbucks might've been your best bet."
40:02;40:03;"- Exactly."
40:03;40:06;"- Does that win Schultz any points?"
40:06;40:07;"In your book, do you ever stop and say,"
40:07;40:11;"""Okay, universal healthcare, that would be nice."""
40:11;40:14;"But if Schultz actually got reinvigorated,"
40:14;40:15;"maybe he's a little burned out on Starbucks"
40:15;40:16;"and he wants a new project."
40:16;40:19;"And if he could promise you that he could take America"
40:19;40:21;"as a nation to that same feeling you had"
40:21;40:24;"when you walked into a Starbucks in '96,"
40:24;40:25;"could that maybe win you over to vote?"
40:25;40:27;"- Absolutely not."
40:27;40:31;"I give Schultz no points towards the White House"
40:31;40:33;"or the success that he brought to Starbucks."
40:33;40:35;"And I don't want that feeling."
40:35;40:39;"What I want is for people to have healthcare"
40:39;40:44;"and for the growing inequality gap to be diminished"
40:44;40:47;"and for greater rights for disadvantaged groups"
40:47;40:49;"like women and minorities and homosexuals."
40:49;40:52;"So that is what I care about,"
40:52;40:56;"not the feeling that I got when visiting a Starbucks."
40:56;40:58;"- Straight shooter, common sense, I dig it."
40:58;41:02;"- Okay, I would say your priorities are officially in order."
41:02;41:04;"Although it does surprise me that if he really wanted"
41:04;41:07;"to try to spin his corporate experience into something,"
41:07;41:09;"he could say something like,"
41:09;41:13;"""Listen, Donald Trump had a whole crazy real estate business."
41:13;41:16;"""I ran a business that actually was on the ground"
41:16;41:18;"""dealing with a lot of people every day."
41:18;41:20;"""I wasn't just selling apartments to rich people."
41:20;41:22;"""I was bringing coffee to all sorts of people"
41:22;41:22;"""around the country."
41:22;41:24;"""And I wanna use that experience"
41:24;41:26;"""to do something positive with healthcare"
41:26;41:27;"""and create universal,"" you know,"
41:27;41:29;"even that though he can't promise."
41:29;41:31;"- And Starbucks was known for providing healthcare."
41:31;41:32;"- Yeah, that's weird too."
41:32;41:35;"- Or was 20 hours a week, is that, or what, 30 hours?"
41:35;41:37;"- Right, so yes, that's exactly right."
41:37;41:39;"Part-timers, 20 hours a week."
41:39;41:41;"- Why can't he at least promise the Starbucks model?"
41:41;41:44;"As long as you're able-bodied, you work 20 hours a week,"
41:44;41:47;"maybe, you know, do a shift at the post office,"
41:47;41:48;"maybe help clean up a part."
41:48;41:51;"That'd be, that would almost be like the new deal,"
41:51;41:52;"the new Starbucks deal."
41:52;41:55;"- I think he's disconnected from the American people."
41:55;41:57;"- Schultz, give up, man."
41:57;41:58;"Bad vibes."
41:58;42:01;"Until Schultz stops running for president,"
42:01;42:02;"coffee'd be in all day."
42:02;42:03;"- Oh, hell yeah."
42:03;42:04;"Third wave all the way."

42:50;42:52;"- Winter, have you tried the Ariana Grande?"
42:52;42:53;"- I did."
42:53;42:55;"I heard you folks talking about it,"
42:55;42:58;"and I decided to try it for myself."
42:58;43:01;"And I think I'm on the same page as you, Jake."
43:01;43:05;"It is too sweet, and it has too many calories,"
43:05;43:09;"and there's no way that I would have one of those"
43:09;43:11;"at every Starbucks like you suggested."
43:11;43:13;"- Oh yeah, I thought about you doing that,"
43:13;43:16;"like slamming like 12 of those in a day."
43:16;43:18;"- Oh God, it's like, just--"
43:18;43:19;"- It's a true nightmare."
43:19;43:21;"- Just cardiac arrest."
43:21;43:23;"- Oh God, I'd be in the grave."
43:23;43:24;"- Yeah, you'd be dead."
43:24;43:28;"- Now, if Ariana Grande was out there with me"
43:28;43:30;"to spend some time with her, might be worth it,"
43:30;43:32;"but I don't know if I wanna kill myself for that."
43:32;43:34;"- Okay, wait, hold on, Winter."
43:34;43:34;"- I like this angle."
43:34;43:35;"- Are you a fan?"
43:35;43:38;"- Oh sure, she's got chops."
43:38;43:40;"People dismiss her, but she can actually sing."
43:40;43:41;"- Oh, she can definitely sing."
43:41;43:43;"But hold on, Winter."
43:43;43:44;"There's a little more to the story"
43:44;43:46;"that we found out since the last episode."
43:46;43:50;"So as discussed, one of the prominent ingredients"
43:50;43:53;"in the Cloud Macchiato, Ariana Grande Starbucks beverage,"
43:53;43:55;"is egg whites."
43:55;43:58;"Well, it turns out that Ms. Grande is a vegan."
43:58;43:59;"- Yes."
43:59;44:01;"- The whole wing of her fan base,"
44:01;44:04;"which are vegan Ariana-nanonators,"
44:04;44:07;"and they're up in arms because there's no version"
44:07;44:10;"of the drink that they can make that's vegan."
44:10;44:13;"Even if you replace the milk with soy milk,"
44:13;44:14;"there's still the eggs."
44:14;44:15;"- So she hasn't even vetted it."
44:15;44:16;"- Well, that's what we don't know."
44:16;44:18;"I assume that Ariana was very involved"
44:18;44:20;"in the research and development phase of this beverage."
44:20;44:22;"What's your take on that, Winter?"
44:22;44:25;"Are the vegan Ariana-nators right to cancel her?"
44:25;44:27;"- Well, I mean, to come to her defense,"
44:27;44:29;"she could have just legitimately missed it."
44:29;44:33;"So what she needs to do now is own up to it"
44:33;44:36;"and say that she's going to work with Starbucks"
44:36;44:40;"to see if they can figure out how to do it in a vegan way."
44:40;44:41;"I don't know if that's possible,"
44:41;44:46;"but I do think that her fans have a legitimate complaint."
44:46;44:50;"It's been blowing up my Google Starbucks alerts."
44:50;44:51;"- Oh, really?"
44:51;44:52;"- I'll tell you that."
44:52;44:54;"Yeah, it's all over my Google News feed."
44:54;44:56;"I see it like every day."
44:56;44:59;"- Oh, really, that's dominating the Starbucks news cycle?"
44:59;45:00;"- Yeah."
45:00;45:02;"- I mean, it's just a dumb drink."
45:02;45:04;"- We need Howard Schultz to weigh in on this."
45:04;45:07;"If we have any political journalists listening,"
45:07;45:09;"next time you're at a Howard Schultz press conference"
45:09;45:12;"being like, how do you expect to run America"
45:12;45:13;"when you can't even deal"
45:13;45:16;"with Ariana Grande's beverage properly?"
45:16;45:18;"I mean, that's a crisis."
45:18;45:19;"That's a bad look for Starbucks."
45:19;45:20;"It's a bad look for Ariana."
45:20;45:22;"It's a bad look for Cloud Macchiato's."
45:22;45:26;"I was trying to think of some charitable takes on this"
45:26;45:28;"'cause I'm just a charitable guy."
45:28;45:29;"What do you think about this, Winter?"
45:29;45:30;"I'm not a vegan,"
45:30;45:32;"but I've always respect the out of vegans."
45:32;45:32;"- Hell yeah."
45:32;45:34;"- Anybody listens to TC knows"
45:34;45:36;"that I don't make fun of vegans."
45:36;45:39;"I think making fun of vegans is weak"
45:39;45:42;"and I will be vegan at some point."
45:42;45:44;"- I do respect them, yes."
45:44;45:46;"- I respect the hell out of vegans."
45:46;45:49;"And also just making fun of vegans is just so lame."
45:49;45:50;"- Who does that?"
45:50;45:51;"- Oh, so many people."
45:51;45:54;"People associate vegans with being sanctimonious."
45:54;45:54;"- Sure."
45:54;45:55;"- And my one thing that I'll say is like,"
45:55;45:57;"the earth is dying."
45:57;45:59;"- Yeah, they got cause."
45:59;46:01;"- People are sanctimonious about all sorts of nonsense."
46:01;46:05;"Honestly, your lifestyle is creating way less pollution."
46:05;46:07;"Like you could be a little sanctimonious."
46:07;46:09;"I know some vegans very well."
46:09;46:11;"I've never had anybody watch me like eat something"
46:11;46:14;"and be like, what the is wrong with you?"
46:14;46:15;"But if a vegan said like,"
46:15;46:17;"hey man, I know you eat a lot of meat."
46:17;46:18;"You know, I don't wanna bother you,"
46:18;46:20;"but maybe you might wanna know why I don't."
46:20;46:22;"I don't think that's overstepping."
46:22;46:23;"- That'd be annoying."
46:23;46:24;"- It'd be annoying, but I'd still,"
46:24;46:26;"I wouldn't be irate about it."
46:26;46:27;"- For sure."
46:27;46:28;"- Oh, and also Nick said that he saw footage"
46:28;46:30;"of her drinking it somewhere."
46:30;46:32;"So maybe she's not even a real vegan."
46:32;46:33;"And maybe Arnie Granny could say,"
46:33;46:35;"guys, you caught me red handed."
46:35;46:36;"I'm not a real vegan."
46:36;46:40;"If you come by my house, I'll just be eating, you know."
46:40;46:41;"- Scrambled eggs."
46:41;46:43;"- I'll be eating scrambled eggs."
46:43;46:44;"I mean, she's originally from New Jersey,"
46:44;46:45;"so she might go straight to the fridge"
46:45;46:48;"and get one of those pre-sliced packages of pepperonis"
46:48;46:50;"and just pop them in her mouth."
46:50;46:51;"- Meatball sub."
46:51;46:53;"- She's probably eating meatball subs."
46:53;46:54;"She's eating chicken parms."
46:54;46:55;"- She's saying she's vegan"
46:55;46:57;"'cause it's like a chic, cool thing."
46:57;46:59;"- Perhaps."
46:59;47:00;"She's eating veal parmesan."
47:00;47:02;"- We're throwing her under the bus here."
47:02;47:05;"- And we're, no, no, we're, hold on."
47:05;47:06;"I didn't get to the end of the story."
47:06;47:08;"You know I'm team, I'm an Ariana, and then a later."
47:08;47:10;"So, you know, deep down, at the end of the day,"
47:10;47:11;"guys, you caught me red handed."
47:11;47:12;"I'm a Jersey girl."
47:12;47:15;"I mean, you really think I'm gonna go more than a week"
47:15;47:17;"without eating a veal parmesan?"
47:17;47:19;"Jersey girl."
47:19;47:20;"And she's like, all right, guys, you caught me red handed."
47:20;47:22;"I'm not a real vegan."
47:22;47:25;"And people say, so did you say it just to win some clout?"
47:25;47:26;"Yeah, the clout was nice."
47:26;47:29;"But also, I'm an influential person."
47:29;47:32;"I don't personally have the resolve"
47:32;47:35;"to go more than six, seven days without eating veal parm."
47:35;47:37;"It's part of my culture."
47:37;47:40;"But I made a decision."
47:40;47:42;"- Veal, like, the harshest."
47:42;47:43;"- Veal is so harsh."
47:43;47:48;"Also, there's something about a veal parm sub"
47:48;47:51;"that's also the most brutal 'cause it's like,"
47:51;47:53;"the meat is so brutal, and then you put a parm"
47:53;47:55;"and then you just throw it on a sandwich for lunch."
47:55;47:57;"- Like two in the afternoon."
47:57;47:59;"- So maybe her point is, you're right, guys."
47:59;48:01;"Some of my motives weren't that pure,"
48:01;48:02;"but one of my motives was pure,"
48:02;48:05;"and that was knowing that I'm an influential person."
48:05;48:07;"And I could eat veal parm all day,"
48:07;48:11;"but if I use my influence to convince even 3%"
48:11;48:13;"of my fan base to go vegan,"
48:13;48:16;"I've decreased meat consumption in such a big way."
48:16;48:17;"And I have to live with the guilt."
48:17;48:20;"When I'm chowing down on that veal parm"
48:20;48:22;"during the break at my show, do I feel like a hypocrite?"
48:22;48:24;"The answer is yes, and I don't feel good about that."
48:24;48:27;"But I am helping decrease meat consumption"
48:27;48:29;"by masquerading as a vegan."
48:29;48:31;"And yeah, my wires got crossed"
48:31;48:32;"with this whole Starbucks thing."
48:32;48:35;"As I previously said, I am not actually a vegan,"
48:35;48:37;"but I'm gonna continue to pretend to be a vegan"
48:37;48:39;"because that's my form of advocacy."
48:39;48:40;"- I love it, man."
48:40;48:41;"- Is there anything wrong with that?"
48:41;48:42;"Winter, what's your take?"
48:42;48:45;"- Oh my God, I think she'd be crucified."
48:45;48:48;"Ezra, you are a brilliant, brilliant songwriter."
48:48;48:50;"You are amazingly talented,"
48:50;48:52;"but I'm not sure that working at the PR department"
48:52;48:55;"can work out for you."
48:55;48:56;"If that's the advice you're giving."
48:56;48:58;"- Okay, but hold on, I'm not done, Winter."
48:58;49:02;"And then she drops a trap banger called veal parm."
49:02;49:05;"You know, I pay off some of my paparazzi contacts"
49:05;49:06;"and we get a little sneak peek."
49:06;49:07;"Oh, what's this?"
49:07;49:09;"Is Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson back together?"
49:09;49:11;"They got spotted eating a veal parm"
49:11;49:13;"at a deli in New Jersey."
49:13;49:16;"- Dude, also she's buying that veal cutlet at the deli."
49:17;49:19;"- Throwing it on that small charcoal grill."

50:23;50:26;"- Maybe my PR strategy won't work,"
50:26;50:29;"but I'm just saying ethically, forget about PR."
50:29;50:31;"I agree with Winner, she would get crucified."
50:31;50:33;"But just you as a human being,"
50:33;50:37;"do you buy the moral argument that even though Ariana's,"
50:37;50:40;"I would call it an addiction to veal parm sandwiches"
50:40;50:45;"probably results in the murder of, I don't know,"
50:45;50:50;"a hundred calves a year, that ultimately her influence"
50:50;50:54;"as a vegan influencer outweighs that?"
50:54;50:55;"You know, it's like one of those moral questions,"
50:55;50:58;"if you could flip the switch to kill one person"
50:58;51:02;"or kill five, you know, that kind of thing."
51:02;51:03;"- Well, as a matter of fact, Ezra,"
51:03;51:05;"I was a philosophy major in college."
51:05;51:06;"- Oh, hell yeah."
51:06;51:08;"- In addition to a computer science major."
51:08;51:10;"So your question really appeals to me,"
51:10;51:14;"and I wanna say that yes, the math works out in her favor,"
51:14;51:18;"but unfortunately that's not the way that people work."
51:18;51:22;"And so the outrage from the hypocrisy"
51:22;51:25;"would probably do more harm overall."
51:25;51:27;"- The outrage from the hypocrisy would just muddy the waters"
51:27;51:30;"about what it even means to be a vegan."
51:30;51:33;"And suddenly all these people like to make fun of vegans."
51:33;51:35;"I mean, there's been a lot of hoaxes in the news lately."
51:35;51:36;"- I was just thinking about that."
51:36;51:38;"- There's the big college hoax or something."
51:38;51:41;"And honestly, I've been saying for a long time,"
51:41;51:42;"they should just end college."
51:42;51:44;"The whole institution's always been corrupt."
51:44;51:47;"Now it's, you know, it seems even more rotten."
51:47;51:50;"Now suddenly people just lose faith in the institution."
51:50;51:53;"People often say that's what people"
51:53;51:55;"who believe in Russian collusion,"
51:55;51:57;"the only take that I buy is not that the Russians"
51:57;52:00;"are controlling the US,"
52:00;52:01;"it's that maybe they had a pretty good idea"
52:01;52:03;"that if you wanna just (beep) with the country,"
52:03;52:06;"you just make people lose faith in what's real."
52:06;52:09;"And I guess if a prominent vegan was exposed"
52:09;52:12;"to be a veal Parmesan fraud,"
52:12;52:14;"the outrage and the controversy"
52:14;52:17;"would make all sorts of non-vegans even more adamant"
52:17;52:19;"about the idea that veganism is just a pose."
52:19;52:22;"And it would move even further away from what it really is,"
52:22;52:24;"which is a kind of moral--"
52:24;52:26;"- Well, it's like global warming too."
52:26;52:27;"- Right."
52:27;52:30;"- If you're like a wealthy advocate for climate change--"
52:30;52:31;"- DiCaprio."
52:31;52:32;"- Right, and you're flying around in a PJ."
52:32;52:33;"- Yeah."
52:33;52:36;"- People see that as hypocritical."
52:36;52:40;"It's not as extreme as the Ariana Veal fantasy."
52:40;52:41;"This is parody, folks."
52:41;52:44;"- Oh yeah, this is a total flight of fancy."
52:44;52:47;"Although it does make me wonder in the real way,"
52:47;52:52;"has Ariana Grande ever eaten a veal parm sub on a PJ?"
52:52;52:55;"Maybe she just played Madison Square Garden"
52:55;52:58;"and one of her assistants ran to Jersey"
52:58;53:00;"to get a really good veal parm sub"
53:00;53:01;"and they bring it back to her and say,"
53:01;53:03;"""You know, you can eat this on the flight"
53:03;53:04;"back to Beverly Hills."""
53:04;53:07;"As much as I know there's so many ethical problems with that"
53:07;53:10;"it does warm the cockles of my heart a little bit"
53:10;53:12;"just to see one of us make it."
53:12;53:13;"We're off the rails here, Wendler."
53:13;53:14;"Sorry, dude."
53:14;53:15;"- No, that's fine."
53:15;53:17;"You wanna bring it back to Starbucks though?"
53:17;53:19;"- Let's bring it back to-- - I'd love to."
53:19;53:22;"- So we've been mostly interested in Howard Schultz"
53:22;53:24;"and Ariana Grande in terms of Starbucks news,"
53:24;53:26;"but we don't have Starbucks Google alerts."
53:26;53:28;"Is there anything else that we're missing?"
53:28;53:31;"What else is going on in the Starbucks universe?"
53:31;53:34;"- Well, one big thing is store closures"
53:34;53:36;"that they announced right around the time"
53:36;53:37;"that I spoke to you last."
53:37;53:40;"They announced they were tripling store closures"
53:40;53:45;"from 50 to 150 for the United States this year."
53:45;53:47;"And I've been tracking that pretty closely."
53:47;53:51;"In fact, I just posted up a list of stores that have closed"
53:51;53:56;"and they're already at 150 and they're still going."
53:56;53:59;"So I think that number is gonna be closer to 200."
53:59;54:00;"Stores are dropping like flies."
54:00;54:04;"New York, Manhattan has lost like 10 stores."
54:04;54:07;"- So is the Starbucks fleet down in net?"
54:07;54:09;"Like are they opening more than they're closing"
54:09;54:11;"or are they closing more than they're opening?"
54:11;54:13;"- They are opening more than they're closing."
54:13;54:14;"- Okay, so it's still going up."
54:14;54:17;"- They've opened hundreds of stores"
54:17;54:22;"in corporate stores in the US and Canada in 2018."
54:22;54:24;"That's not even counting international stores."
54:24;54:28;"I think when we spoke originally, they were around 28,000."
54:28;54:29;"I think they're around 30,000 now."
54:29;54:31;"- So this is just a reorganization?"
54:31;54:33;"That's like Mickey D's numbers."
54:33;54:35;"- They were just too dense in the cities."
54:35;54:37;"So most of the closures have been in cities"
54:37;54:42;"like Los Angeles, Southland, Bay Area, New York City."
54:42;54:44;"- That makes sense. - Chicago."
54:44;54:45;"- I mean, Manhattan's a joke."
54:45;54:48;"It's like Chase Bank and Starbucks, like every other block."
54:48;54:50;"Now they're just gonna be packed though."
54:50;54:54;"- Back in 2008, a decade ago, during the first purge,"
54:54;54:56;"where they shut down about a thousand stores."
54:56;54:57;"- Whoa."
54:57;55:00;"- A lot of those were in remote markets, smaller cities."
55:00;55:02;"This time around, those stores have been"
55:02;55:04;"relatively unscathed."
55:04;55:06;"It's just the bigger cities that are getting hit."
55:06;55:08;"- Makes sense."
55:08;55:10;"Well, we'll definitely be keeping an eye on that."
55:10;55:11;"Well, thanks so much for calling in, Winter."
55:11;55:14;"Gotta have you back in person next time you're in LA,"
55:14;55:16;"and we'll definitely have you call in again soon."
55:16;55:16;"- Absolutely."
55:16;55:18;"It is always a pleasure talking to you guys"
55:18;55:20;"and love listening to your show."
55:20;55:21;"- All right, thanks, man. - All right, take care."
55:21;55:23;"- Have a good one. - Bye-bye."

56:39;56:42;"We drink Cloud Macchiatos and eat Sour Patch Kids cereal."
56:42;56:44;"Is that SPK cereal still around?"
56:44;56:46;"It's here on the premises?"
56:46;56:47;"- Very stale."
56:47;56:49;"- I might wanna try a bite."
56:49;56:50;"I had a thought the other day where I was like,"
56:50;56:51;"you know what this would be good for?"
56:51;56:53;"As a topping for ice cream."
56:53;56:54;"What do you think about that?"
56:54;56:55;"- Dark."
56:55;56:57;"(laughing)"
56:57;56:59;"- Not a fan of that concept."
56:59;57:01;"But anyway, we've received a can"
57:01;57:06;"of the Smart Mouth Brewing Company's Saturday morning beer,"
57:06;57:08;"which is not officially licensed,"
57:08;57:13;"but kind of branded as a Lucky Charms style cereal beer."
57:13;57:15;"It's all Lucky Charms colors and shapes,"
57:15;57:16;"but it doesn't say Lucky Charms."
57:16;57:19;"And it says magically ridiculous at the bottom."
57:19;57:21;"So first of all, I gotta say that we're just falling"
57:21;57:23;"for this stuff hook, line, and sinker."
57:23;57:25;"I mean, I was watching Desus and Mero the other day"
57:25;57:27;"and they drank one can of this too."
57:27;57:28;"- Oh really?"
57:28;57:29;"- They tried and I'm just like,"
57:29;57:30;"that's how stuff works these days."
57:30;57:31;"It's like, I guess it's also similar"
57:31;57:35;"to when we ate the Flamin' Hot Cheetos bagel."
57:35;57:38;"A local company does some kind of stunty thing."
57:38;57:39;"Next thing you know, shock jocks like us."
57:39;57:42;"- Yeah, this is the real morning zeal in us."
57:42;57:42;"- Yeah."
57:42;57:44;"So guys, crazy story out of Virginia."
57:44;57:47;"Some mad scientists over there."
57:47;57:48;"It's always that thing where it's like,"
57:48;57:50;"people are like, here's a crazy story."
57:50;57:51;"Somebody's making a blah, blah, blah."
57:51;57:53;"And it's always like, what do they think of next?"
57:53;57:55;"And it's always like, well, they thought of that"
57:55;57:56;"so that you would do this piece."
57:56;57:58;"- Audio clickbait."
57:58;57:58;"- Anyway."
57:58;58:00;"- So where's the brewery out of?"
58:00;58:02;"What is Smart Mouth Brewery?"
58:02;58:03;"- Norfolk, Virginia."
58:03;58:06;"♪ Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia ♪"
58:06;58:09;"Vampire Week is playing in Norfolk later this year."
58:09;58:11;"- We're working on a cover of Promised Land."
58:11;58:12;"- Oh really?"
58:12;58:14;"It crossed my mind in Norfolk, Virginia"
58:14;58:15;"to bust out Promised Land,"
58:15;58:16;"but they probably get that all the time."
58:16;58:17;"- Right."
58:17;58:19;"Are you guys doing any dead covers?"
58:19;58:21;"- I think that'd be a bridge too far."
58:21;58:23;"Maybe one day when the smoke clears."
58:23;58:24;"I mean, we have all these people"
58:24;58:26;"accusing us of being a jam band now."
58:26;58:28;"Just 'cause we dropped a little mixolydian."
58:28;58:30;"- Yeah, that was funny on the internet"
58:30;58:32;"when you dropped Sunflower."
58:32;58:33;"Like it opened Twitter and it'd be like--"
58:33;58:35;"- Oh yeah, there was like a moment that said vampire--"
58:35;58:38;"- Yeah, you go to the like trends or whatever"
58:38;58:40;"and it's just like this big picture of you"
58:40;58:41;"and it's sort of like,"
58:41;58:44;"people are calling Vampire Weekend a jam band."
58:44;58:46;"I'm just like, why is this a news item?"
58:46;58:47;"And then it's just like,"
58:47;58:49;"Jared Kushner like right underneath it."
58:49;58:50;"- Yeah."
58:50;58:52;"- I'm just like, okay."
58:52;58:53;"- I mean, I thought it was kind of funny,"
58:53;58:55;"but my take is that,"
58:55;58:57;"well the funny thing is that"
58:57;58:59;"we stretched a few things out live."
58:59;59:01;"You know, now we've got some more musicians"
59:01;59:02;"and that's kind of fun."
59:02;59:04;"You can call that a form of jamming,"
59:04;59:05;"but Sunflower is a funny one"
59:05;59:07;"because the song's like two minutes long."
59:07;59:10;"- Yeah, I was thinking it's more like kind of light prog."
59:10;59:11;"- That's interesting."
59:11;59:12;"- Not really jam."
59:12;59:14;"- Well, there's no guitar solo."
59:14;59:16;"- Right, it's very like--"
59:16;59:17;"- But I think you also gotta understand something"
59:17;59:19;"is that people like us are interested"
59:19;59:21;"in this tasteful palette of the 1970s"
59:21;59:25;"and the various tributations, if that's a word."
59:25;59:26;"- Tributaries."
59:26;59:28;"- Tributaries, the mutations, the tributaries,"
59:28;59:30;"the tributations."
59:30;59:31;"To a lot of people, it's just kind of like"
59:31;59:33;"you throw in one flat seventh"
59:33;59:35;"and they're just like jam band."
59:35;59:37;"I don't always want to like comment on stuff in real time,"
59:37;59:39;"but even with Harmony Hall,"
59:39;59:40;"a lot of people are like,"
59:40;59:41;"this sounds like the Grateful Dead."
59:41;59:42;"And I was kind of like,"
59:42;59:43;"that opening riff is more like--"
59:43;59:45;"- Yeah, I don't hear that at all."
59:45;59:47;"- I know, but then I also take a step back"
59:47;59:47;"and I'm like,"
59:47;59:49;"I don't know what people said in a complimentary way."
59:49;59:50;"- Sure."
59:50;59:51;"- So I also don't want to be like,"
59:51;59:53;"actually, I thought maybe more almonds,"
59:53;59:55;"like the harmonized (mimics harmonized music)"
59:55;59:56;"- I mean, maybe the solo at the end,"
59:56;59:59;"but it's like palm muted."
59:59;01:00:01;"So it's like, that's not a real Jerry move,"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"but I'm just taking it too literally."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"- I know, I know, yeah."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"- It sounds like the dead, I'm like--"
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- So on the one hand, it's--"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Not real, it sounds more like the stones to me."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"- The groove, kind of the piano-driven groove"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"of Harmony Hall is super like--"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"- Exile era."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"- Yeah, beggar, beggar banquet."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- Beggar's banquet, Aaron Stones."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"- But at the end of the day, it's also, I'm kind of like,"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"I think that's why you can't get into this stuff"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"in real time because you also don't want to be"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"hitting people with actuallys"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"when they're just trying to be like,"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"hear what they hear in music and that's cool too."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"- Yeah, that'd be so weak if you were just like--"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"- If somebody's just like,"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"yeah, I've gotten a lot of DMs from people"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"like loving the new tunes,"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"like it takes me back to listening to the dead"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"and I was just like,"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"well, you don't know what the (beep) you're talking about."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"'Cause the truth is,"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"it's not like the dead and the stones"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"don't have a lot of shared DNA too."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"- None."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"- And I know what people mean because like,"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"of course I love the jam band references."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"I just kind of feel like you can't go too far with it"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"'cause the true definition of a jam band"
01:00:56;01:00:59;"is live improvisational music."
01:00:59;01:01:02;"Anyway, let's try this Lucky Charms."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- Oh, geez."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- Bottoms up."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"- Very perfumey."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- It more or less tastes like a real--"
01:01:09;01:01:09;"- It's like an IPA."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"- Like a regular, yeah, and it is an IPA with marshmallows."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"What does it mean with marshmallows?"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"Are there actual like chunks in there?"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- No."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"- It's like a little sweeter."
01:01:18;01:01:18;"- It's okay."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"- It's not terrible."
01:01:19;01:01:22;"- It's not shockingly horrendous."
01:01:22;01:01:23;"- I would actually say that the Sour Patch Kids cereal"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"is like way harsher than this."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"- For sure."
01:01:27;01:01:30;"- As I say that though, I do want to get one more handful."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"Let me hit that SPK real quick."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"I've been thinking about this."
01:01:34;01:01:38;"- Ooh, yeah."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"- Sunflower."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Shout out to Smart Mouth Brewery"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"and I'm chasing it with some SPK cereal."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- You know it'd be tight if there was a micro brewery"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"that did a Vampire Weekend brew."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"'Cause I've seen this with bands."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- I know, would it be?"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"I feel like there's so many now."
01:01:51;01:01:51;"- There's a Godify Voices beer."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"- There's a Sublime beer I see everywhere in LA now."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"- Right."
01:01:55;01:01:56;"- There's a Dead beer."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- Right."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- It might just be like a limited."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"I kind of feel like it's played out in a way."
01:02:00;01:02:01;"- But it'd be cool."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- We gotta find the right brewery."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- Or maybe like a tequila."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"- I'm more into the tequila."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"- A Vampire Weekend tequila?"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- Yeah, Vampire Weekend beer just doesn't feel quite right."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- Like you guys are not a beer band at all."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"- What about like--"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"- Vampire Weekend branded coffee."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- But I feel like I see that a lot too."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"- Yeah, I think tequila dude."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"- I think tequila 'cause that's the rarefied province"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"of Sammy Hagar, George Clooney."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"I also like the idea that it should be like"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"impossible to get and people start to question"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"if it's real or not."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- Very limited edition."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Very limited."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"What's something that just nobody does?"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"Like gin?"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"- Actually that's more on point."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Like a gin and tonic."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"- Just a fine gin."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"- I mean that's more like old school Vampire Weekend."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"Like first album era."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- Yeah, kind of like preppy."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- A branded gin and tonic."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Yeah."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- It'll be super dark."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- What?"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"- Water."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"(laughing)"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"- Bottled water?"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- That'd be so harsh."
01:02:54;01:02:57;"- Jaden has a water brand that does sustainable."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Well it's like sustainable, it comes in cardboard."
01:02:59;01:03:02;"Maybe he'd link up for a VW water."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"- What about like--"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"- Seltzer?"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"- Maybe like a food product?"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"- Popcorn and raisins."
01:03:08;01:03:10;"- I mean this is just going full circle"
01:03:10;01:03:13;"to Time Crisis branded Frosted Flakes."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"I don't know why that's so (beep) hard."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"- It is a legal and logistical nightmare."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"(laughing)"
01:03:20;01:03:23;"- I've been trying for years to get that off the ground."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"And look what happened."
01:03:24;01:03:28;"Now I gotta go put out a record, gotta go tour."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Man I could've been sitting on Easy Street"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"just raking in that Frosted Flakes money."
01:03:33;01:03:38;"But my incompetent lawyers could not get the deal done man."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"(laughing)"
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Seinfeld if you're listening,"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"I hope that you figured out some way"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"we can get this thing popping in Japan."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"- We have to call Seinfeld if he's not back next show."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"- Oh definitely, we need to check in from Seinfeld."

01:05:26;01:05:45;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats One."
01:05:45;01:05:48;"- Okay, one thing that I've been meaning to talk about,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"I wanna get into this before the top five."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"This story came out a few weeks ago"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"and I didn't wanna let it lie too long."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"But this is a band that we've talked about"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"quite a bit on the show."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"And it's Imagine Dragons."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"And I would like to think that outside of occasionally"
01:06:01;01:06:04;"just being cheeky and calling them imagination dragons,"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"just 'cause I did that once by accident"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"and then it became a thing."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"I think we've always been pretty respectful of them."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"I would actually say they've grown on us a lot."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Everybody's on their own trip, you know?"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"So I think everybody who's in a band or something,"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"you probably think that, oh,"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"everybody's making fun of you or something."
01:06:18;01:06:21;"Like Vampire Weekend, we've had our share of haters."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"- Sure, I remember."
01:06:22;01:06:24;"- And I've occasionally referenced that to somebody"
01:06:24;01:06:27;"and somebody being like, you guys have had it so good."
01:06:27;01:06:28;"What are you talking about?"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"You're a very well-respected band."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"Like something like that, I'm just like, well, yeah,"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"but the other day I saw somebody on my Instagram"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"and they're just like, what are you talking about?"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"And look, that goes all different ways."
01:06:38;01:06:41;"So it's just like any field or just life,"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"everybody's on their own trip,"
01:06:42;01:06:46;"everybody thinks that they're getting uniquely hated on"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"or we're all in our own feelings more."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"And so you think about Imagine Dragons or something"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"and you're like, oh, they're massive,"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"raking in the dough, playing big shows,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"hit after hit, like they're killing it."
01:06:58;01:06:59;"- Tons of fans."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"- Tons of fans, like they're on easy street."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"I'd rather be Imagine Dragons than me, up to a point."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"So anyway, you think about that and then you realize,"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"well, even they're on their own trip"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"and they're kind of thinking, you know,"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"all that money and success goes out the window"
01:07:11;01:07:14;"when a mean-spirited comment cuts you to the core."
01:07:14;01:07:17;"Same as for me, same for anybody at any level."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"So anyway, I was kind of sad to see this."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"A few weeks ago, Imagine Dragons front man, Dan Reynolds,"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"who we've shouted out on the show"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"'cause we know he does advocacy"
01:07:25;01:07:29;"for the LGBT Mormon community"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"'cause that's a whole complicated thing."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"He was pushed to the edge and he felt the need"
01:07:33;01:07:38;"to like drop a couple long form notes on Instagram."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"This is what he said."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"""For a decade now, I've dealt with critics and other bands"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"""saying extremely harsh things about my band,"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"""not what I would call fair criticism,"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"""which I always try my best to receive and learn from,"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"""but actual clickbait horse (beep)"
01:07:51;01:07:54;"""words filled with vile and hate meant to feed humanities"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"""need to laugh at each other's imperfections and fails."""
01:07:57;01:07:58;"So first of all, I know that a lot of people"
01:07:58;01:08:01;"when they hear a musician say something like that,"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"they're like, okay, all right, yeah, you're just mad."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"But it's really true."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Come on, we all know that there's a difference"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"between fair criticism where somebody's just like,"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"honestly, I don't (beep) with this."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"Here's where I think it fails."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Here's what I think they're trying to do"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"and it didn't live up to it."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"Here's why I think this is better."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"That stuff can be painful,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"but somebody says like, your song sucks."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"It's like, what are you gonna do?"
01:08:19;01:08:19;"- Yep."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- That's par for the course."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"But he's totally right that there's something different."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"And Imagine Dragons, I could imagine getting,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"and I think Vampire Weekend got that in the early days,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"maybe not at the same level."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"Not just somebody being like,"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"here's what I think sucks about this."
01:08:30;01:08:31;"I don't like the voice."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"I don't like the, where it really becomes so obvious"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"that they're creating a whole spectacle."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"They're performing hatred in this way to be like,"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"this is the worst thing ever."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- Yep, I remember you guys."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"- Oh yeah, we had some brutal stuff."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"- Yep."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- And then, you know, sometimes you meet these people"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"down the road and they're just like,"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"whether it's guys in other bands or writers,"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"bad people just be like, oh yeah,"
01:08:53;01:08:55;"you know, I didn't really mean that or something."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"And I also do have to say,"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"kind of like when I talked to Zach"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"about his kind of, who made fun of Vampire Weekend"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"as Vice piece, you also have to have sympathy too,"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"that it's like writers have it really hard too."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"I'd like to imagine if I was a writer,"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"I wouldn't be like writing clickbait things."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Not that that Zach piece was necessarily that,"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"but you know, just stuff like,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"why Imagine Dragons is the worst band of all time."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"I don't think I'd write that."
01:09:15;01:09:19;"But the truth is, this whole advertising universe,"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"the way that ad dollars are spent on the internet"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"incentivizes people to write clickable, shareable stuff,"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"even if that means being a little extra or a lot extra."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"So I think he's right to point out"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"that those are two different types of criticism."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"So he says, ""I've always stood silently"
01:09:34;01:09:35;"""and taken it for years."
01:09:35;01:09:38;"""It has added to the depression I've dealt with since youth."
01:09:38;01:09:40;"""I don't say this in search of sympathy, but just a fact."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"""It's not the person that caused me"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"""the feelings of stress and depression,"
01:09:43;01:09:47;"""but what it does to the world as a band have created."""
01:09:47;01:09:48;"Maybe I'm missing something."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"- Wait, what it does to the world"
01:09:50;01:09:51;"the band has created, maybe?"
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- I don't know."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"""How could it possibly make a kid feel not cool"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"""listening to Imagine Dragons?"
01:09:56;01:09:57;"""I hate that thought."
01:09:57;01:09:58;"""Wondering if my kids will be made fun of"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"""as they grow older because someone thinks"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"""my band isn't cool."
01:10:01;01:10:02;"""That's rough stuff."""
01:10:02;01:10:03;"And I know some people could be like,"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"who cares, your kids are gonna grow up rich."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"They'll probably be going to USC."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"- I'm trying to think of like earlier versions"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"of this same thing of like, Glenn Fry's kids."
01:10:14;01:10:16;"- We've talked about, I don't know about kids."
01:10:16;01:10:19;"- Like hanging out with some like punk indie snobs."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"And they're like, yo, your dad's--"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- The dude from the Eagles?"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"And he's like-- - Lame."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"- And they're like, what are you talking about?"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"This is great, it's volume two."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"It's one of the best selling albums of all time."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"Well, it sucks and you suck and your dad sucks."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- Whoa, that's just some teen stuff, but yeah."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"- I've also always found a little bit,"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"there's like a bit of hypocrisy."
01:10:36;01:10:40;"There's like a type of person online who,"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"it could be a critic or it could just be somebody"
01:10:41;01:10:45;"who generally speaking has very strong feelings"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"about morality, which you can and cannot say,"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"which often is a good thing."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"'Cause there hasn't been enough accountability"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"with some of that stuff."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"But there's definitely the type of person"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"who probably if somebody made a joke"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"about mental illness or something,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"would be like, how dare you?"
01:10:59;01:11:03;"But then might also say something incredibly mean spirited"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"to somebody they don't know."
01:11:04;01:11:07;"And I generally think that as you get older,"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"you kind of realize part of the reason"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"that you try not to be harsh to people,"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"especially people you don't know,"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"is not just be out of some sort of formality."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"It is partially because you just don't know"

01:12:06;01:12:08;"I've gotten over the fact that guys in other bands,"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"the 1975, Foster the People, Smashing Pumpkins,"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Slipknot, et cetera, feel a need to talk badly"
01:12:13;01:12:14;"about my band for whatever reason."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"- That's so funny."
01:12:16;01:12:17;"- That's a hilarious list too."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"- Slipknot and the 1975."
01:12:19;01:12:22;"I know we're talking about being nice to people right now,"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"but come on folks."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"(laughing)"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"- Okay, you know I'm not gonna stick my neck out there."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"I think all of those bands have good things about them."
01:12:31;01:12:34;"But I would also say that all of those bands"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"are very easy to make fun of if you wanna be a (beep)."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"You know what I'm saying? - Absolutely."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"- Like, I truly like things about all of those artists"
01:12:41;01:12:42;"and I think they're all interesting"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"and they've written great songs."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"But it's not like he's like,"
01:12:45;01:12:49;"a lot of people talk (beep) about Imagine Dragons."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"- Lou Reed, Paul McCartney, Elton John."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"- None of these people are either just like"
01:12:53;01:12:56;"unabashedly the greatest songwriters of their generation,"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"nor are they just like unimpeachably cool."
01:12:59;01:13:02;"- The 1975 Throwing Shade is epic."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"That is epic."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"I remember I went to go see,"
01:13:05;01:13:09;"somebody took me to see Jeff Garland's comedy show at Largo."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"You know, and of course I like Jeff Garland"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"'cause I love Curb Your Enthusiasm."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"And every night he has surprise guests."
01:13:16;01:13:17;"So you never know who'll come out."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"So the night I go, the guests are Sarah Silverman"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"and Larry David. - Very cool."
01:13:22;01:13:23;"- So you know, I'm in heaven."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"And I remember at some point,"
01:13:26;01:13:30;"Jeff is sitting there kinda interviewing Larry live"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"and they have this really funny conversation."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"But it starts out with Jeff saying,"
01:13:34;01:13:35;"""So Larry, you watch Saturday Night Live?"""
01:13:35;01:13:37;"And he goes, ""Yeah, yeah, sometimes."""
01:13:37;01:13:40;"And he's like, ""Man, did you watch it the other night?"""
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And he's like, ""Yeah, I watched some of it."""
01:13:42;01:13:44;"And he's like, ""Did you see the musical artist?"""
01:13:44;01:13:45;"And then Larry goes on a hilarious bit"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"about how he's never watched any musical artist"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"ever on Saturday Night Live."
01:13:49;01:13:50;"And Jeff goes, ""What about when you were a writer?"
01:13:50;01:13:51;"""Weren't you like on set?"""
01:13:51;01:13:53;"He's like, ""Yeah, I'd always go to the bathroom"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"""and that or something."""
01:13:54;01:13:54;"But anyway, then Jeff goes,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"""Well, okay, you won't believe the band"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"""that I saw last weekend."""
01:13:58;01:13:59;"And Larry's like, ""Yeah, what is it?"""
01:13:59;01:14:01;"And he goes, ""It's this English band"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"""called The 1975."
01:14:03;01:14:05;"""It was the worst thing I ever saw."""
01:14:05;01:14:07;"And Larry's already checked out 'cause he's like,"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"""Okay, I don't know what you're talking about."""
01:14:08;01:14:11;"And then Jeff goes like, ""This guy who's wearing leather pants"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"""such a wannabe rock star, it was pathetic."
01:14:13;01:14:15;"""He had his shirt off, he could barely sing,"
01:14:15;01:14:16;"""the song was terrible."""
01:14:16;01:14:19;"And he went on this like epic kind of like old man rant"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"about how much The 1975 sucked."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"And just as like an artist who like knows how much it sucks"
01:14:24;01:14:25;"to put yourself out there,"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"which I would like to think a standup comedian"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"would know as well."
01:14:28;01:14:31;"I really came close just on some like artist (beep)"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"to almost being like, ""Yo, shut up, Jeff."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"""Like chill the (beep) out, man."""
01:14:35;01:14:37;"You're decades and decades older than these dudes."
01:14:37;01:14:40;"Like whatever, who cares?"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Can't you just be like, ""I didn't get it."""
01:14:41;01:14:43;"And he was just like ranting in front of all these people"
01:14:43;01:14:45;"and he was trying to get like Larry in on the cause."
01:14:45;01:14:48;"And I remember at the time, I didn't even know The 1975,"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"I just felt kind of protective of them."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"'Cause I was like, I just knew that feeling of like,"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"you're going on this TV show where all sorts of random people"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"are gonna watch you and judge you."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"And I understand a standup comedian's job"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"is to also kind of like make fun of (beep)"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"so maybe I gotta chill out a bit"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"'cause I do admire standup comedy"
01:15:03;01:15:04;"as a profession and a medium."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"And then also I could totally picture too,"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"I could just immediately picture myself like young"
01:15:09;01:15:11;"and having just performed on Saturday Night Live."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"And maybe those guys are curb heads."
01:15:13;01:15:14;"I mean, it wouldn't-"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"- They probably are."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"- It wouldn't be crazy."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I mean, you know, I know some English people"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"who are curb heads."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"And that just imagine like, you're like,"
01:15:20;01:15:21;"""Oh, I like that show."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"""Oh, it's so funny, Larry David's a legend."""
01:15:23;01:15:24;"Then you're just like, ""Well, you know the other guy, Jeff?"""
01:15:24;01:15:25;"And you're like, ""Yeah."""
01:15:25;01:15:26;"It's like, he talked about how much you (beep)"
01:15:26;01:15:29;"sucked on Saturday Night Live for 10 minutes"
01:15:29;01:15:30;"in front of Sarah Silverman and Larry David."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"And you'd be like, ""Really?"""
01:15:33;01:15:34;"It'd just be kind of brutal."

01:16:36;01:16:38;"So all these people feel need to talk badly about my band."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"I don't feel anger towards them, actually."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"Just more of a sadness that this industry embraces,"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"even celebrates with this mentality."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"I wish it felt like a place where artists"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"stood by each other and supported another."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"Dan, I'll (beep) with you, but that's never gonna happen."
01:16:50;01:16:53;"'Cause this industry just pre-selects a lot of nutty people."
01:16:53;01:16:55;"And then even within that crew,"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"sometimes the most competitive, harsh, brutal people"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"end up being the most successful"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"because of those very traits."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Regardless of our different tastes and voices,"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"my bandmates are some of my best friends."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"We are authentically ourselves"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"and strive to bring positivity and empowerment to the world."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"We'll continue to do just that."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"I mean, I'm sure he got a lot of sympathy for this,"
01:17:12;01:17:15;"so hopefully it was a cathartic experience."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"But I do think that if he'd really kept quiet about this"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"for years and years through all their big success,"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"it must've like really got to him at some point,"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"just to feel like he had to write this."
01:17:24;01:17:25;"And the sad part is,"
01:17:25;01:17:28;"I don't think the dude from Slipknot is gonna read that"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"and be like, ""Whoa, sorry, man."""
01:17:30;01:17:30;"- My bad."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"- ""My bad, I have kids too."
01:17:31;01:17:33;"""I've also struggled with depression."""
01:17:33;01:17:36;"And you're right, it's really hard putting yourself out."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"I think this is gonna be like,"
01:17:37;01:17:40;"it's not gonna change anything, but I don't know."
01:17:40;01:17:44;"- Tough to be positive and emotional, but also hip."
01:17:44;01:17:45;"- Right."
01:17:45;01:17:46;"- Those are sort of contradictions."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"- Yeah, unless you're like a pop star."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"- 'Cause they're going for like, yeah,"
01:17:49;01:17:50;"but if they're like a band,"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"they're going for like aspirational."
01:17:51;01:17:52;"- A rock band, yeah."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"Like they said, what did he say?"
01:17:53;01:17:56;"He said, ""Strive to bring positivity"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"""and empowerment to the world."""
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Hell of a goal."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Well, and also--"
01:18:00;01:18:04;"- It's antithetical to like what most bands try to do."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"So, you know, that's the rub."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"- There is a type of character"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"who exists in the music industry."
01:18:10;01:18:13;"They make music that some people perceive to be corny,"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"and they're also really big."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"They can't just be cool with that."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"They're also (beep) and competitive too."
01:18:18;01:18:19;"And that is a very toxic combo."
01:18:19;01:18:22;"So like for instance, there's a version,"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"and I don't get this vibe at all,"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"but there's a version of a guy like Dan"
01:18:24;01:18:27;"from Imagine Dragons, who's in Imagine Dragons,"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"and he knows that people don't think his band's"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"that cool or something."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"And it's maybe antithetical to being hip,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"but the person won't accept that."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"And they're like, ""No, I am hip."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"""And actually I'm (beep) cooler than the 1975."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"""And actually, (beep) those guys."""
01:18:39;01:18:40;"You know, it'd be like some weird combination."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- That's some Corgan."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"- Right, that's more like--"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- Although he doesn't try to go for empowerment."
01:18:43;01:18:48;"He's just like, this is my macro level big rock band,"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"and we're huge, and I'm resentful of those"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"who have much smaller audiences."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"- Right, you think you're so much cooler than me,"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Stephen Malchmus."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"So there's a version of a Dan Reynolds that's like that,"
01:19:00;01:19:01;"but I don't get the impression that he's like that at all."
01:19:01;01:19:03;"And I think like--"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"- It's kind of a new model."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Can you imagine like some of those,"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"like some rock star back in like the '70s?"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Like, you know, like Zeppelin or Queen"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"like got bashed critically."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"- As we saw in ""Bohemian Rhapsody."""
01:19:14;01:19:16;"- Although I didn't finish the film."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"But those bands were like, had huge audiences,"
01:19:19;01:19:20;"but got bashed critically."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"And it's just funny to think about like Robert Plant"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"being like, we're just trying to bring positivity."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- But we also talked on the show about how like,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"from articles that I've read, Phil Collins--"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- Oh, that's a good one."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"- He's also held this negativity in that"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"he's always kind of like, I know I (beep) suck, right?"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"I'm so uncool."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"- He's a perfect case study."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"- Yeah."
01:19:38;01:19:41;"- I mean, his music in the '80s was so uplifting"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"and like, I think it's great, but it is kind of corny."
01:19:44;01:19:46;"- Yeah, well, compared to Peter Gabriel, it seemed corny,"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"but these days people probably look back and be like,"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"oh yeah, I (beep) all that stuff."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"- That'd be kind of a weird bottle episode,"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"like track Phil Collins' career."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"- Oh yeah, I'd do a Phil Collins one."
01:19:54;01:19:57;"- Like starting with his Genesis stuff."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"- Yeah, honestly, that'd be a grail episode"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"if we got Phil Collins on the phone."
01:20:01;01:20:03;"'Cause I've always been so interested in him"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"ever since I read this ""Rolling Stone"" piece"
01:20:04;01:20:08;"where it seemed like he was this guy at all this success."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"And it kind of seemed like the haters won in the film."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"And I was like, but that, it's so crazy"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"because at this moment, all the musicians that I know"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"have at least a few Phil Collins songs"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"that they think are like incredible."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"- Yeah, it's cycled back around, I think."
01:20:21;01:20:23;"- Like you and I differ on ""Limp Bizkit."""
01:20:23;01:20:24;"You think that's irredeemably bad."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- It's true."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"- But I kind of listen back to some of the songs,"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"I'm just like, yo, there's some energy there"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"that seems a little bit fresh in retrospect."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"And I could totally imagine in 20 years,"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"the next generation looking back and making music"
01:20:35;01:20:38;"that semi-ironically or just in a nostalgic way"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"has like an ""Imagine Dragons"" feel."
01:20:40;01:20:43;"And somebody's like, whoa, back in my day,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"we thought the 1975 was cooler than ""Imagine Dragons."""
01:20:45;01:20:47;"They're like, really, why?"
01:20:47;01:20:48;"(laughing)"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"You know, just that shit happens."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- Sure, sure."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"- Anyway, I hope some of these people reach out."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"I wanna find that out."
01:20:54;01:20:56;"I wanna find out if any of these people reached out."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I mean, I would think at least the 1975"
01:20:58;01:21:01;"and ""Foster the People"" being like the kind of younger crew"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"might take pause when they read this and be like,"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"oh man, let me clear that up."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"I would like to think, I'm gonna do some research."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I'm gonna hit up my music industry contacts"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"and say, has anybody from the 1975"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"or ""Foster the People"" reached out?"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"At the very least to say to this dude,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"hey man, like, for all I know,"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"maybe they didn't actually talk (beep)"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"That can happen too."
01:21:18;01:21:20;"Maybe they made a throwaway comment."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"- Sure. - And he saw it"
01:21:21;01:21:23;"and it caught him on a day when he was really struggling"
01:21:23;01:21:26;"with depression or his kid came home from school"
01:21:26;01:21:30;"and was like, daddy, somebody said ""Imagine Dragons"" suck."
01:21:30;01:21:34;"And then he sees a comment and he's like, well, who knows?"
01:21:34;01:21:35;"We'll get to the bottom of it."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"But now let's blast through the top five."
01:21:37;01:21:42;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:21:42;01:21:45;"- And we're doing something special this week."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"- This is a canned episode."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"- Because this is a canned episode,"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"it's as canned as a Lucky Charms beer."
01:21:51;01:21:55;"- This was taped in mid-October of 2018."
01:21:55;01:21:57;"- This was taped in 2009."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"- This is the first TC ever."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"- Yeah."
01:21:59;01:22:04;"You're listening to the first time crisis recently unearthed."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"We're listening to the top five songs"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"in each of our birth years."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"- We've done this before."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"- Did we do just like--"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"- I think we did another canned episode"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"and we did the 77 versus 84."
01:22:14;01:22:17;"- Okay, so we're doing this week more or less"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"in our respective birth years."
01:22:18;01:22:23;"- Yep, I'm sure 84 is gonna kick 77 in the pants, but."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"- Well, we'll see."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"- All right."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"I don't know what's coming, so."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"- Well, Jake, 1977 is off to a strong start"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"at number five, ABBA with ""Dancing Queen""."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"- Oh, geez."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"- Major."
01:22:36;01:22:36;"- That's a great one."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"- Love those piano octaves."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"I mean, this is a stone cold classic."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"- Yeah."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"- I think ABBA was considered deeply uncool"
01:22:48;01:22:49;"in the late '70s."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Oh, for sure."

01:23:21;01:23:24;"Just look back and be like, dude, your band sucked."
01:23:24;01:23:25;"- Yeah."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"- You were a third tier punk band."

01:23:50;01:23:51;"- Oh yeah."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"- It has like a similar tempo and groove."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"- Wait, so they said that they based it off this?"
01:23:55;01:23:57;"- They based the groove off it."
01:23:57;01:23:57;"Actually, you know what?"
01:23:57;01:23:59;"I want them to hear that back to back."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"- MGMT is a tight band."
01:24:00;01:24:03;"- Oh yeah, MGMT talked some mild (beep)"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"about Vampire Weekend."
01:24:04;01:24:04;"- Did they?"
01:24:04;01:24:05;"- But it was also one of those things--"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- They're tight, I mean like that second record is sweet."
01:24:07;01:24:09;"- There's some throwaway comment that at the time"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"I was very sensitive and maybe traumatized"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"by some harsher things and then when I first met them,"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"I was like, I don't know about these dudes."
01:24:15;01:24:18;"But then they always turned out to be cool."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"And also their record label was very competitive"
01:24:19;01:24:20;"with our record label."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- What label?"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"- They were on Columbia, which we're on now,"
01:24:23;01:24:24;"although you know, this is 10 years ago."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"So it was a totally different crew."
01:24:26;01:24:27;"- That's funny 'cause you went there."
01:24:27;01:24:29;"- Oh yeah, after all that (beep) talking,"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I was like, I wanna see what's going on over here."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"- No, but you also went to Columbia University."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"- Yeah, no, that's what I'm talking about."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"Oh, right."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"- But weird--"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"- Columbia Records versus Columbia University."
01:24:37;01:24:39;"- What kind of strings did your dad pull?"
01:24:39;01:24:40;"- Yeah."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"- Get you in there, man?"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"- I played a water polo."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"- Ezra was a really good rugby player."
01:24:46;01:24:49;"- Yeah, oh yeah, I played, there's one picture of me."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"There's one photo."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"- Right."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"- Wait, hold on, this is MGMT's song."
01:24:59;01:25:10;"Iconic synth part."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"- This feels way slower."
01:25:11;01:25:23;"- It's got that same kind of (imitates synth)"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"♪ Oh, you can dance ♪"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"- I see the basic idea."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Anyway, MGMT just had some throwaway comment"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"and some thing, and I just didn't know how to take it,"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"and especially because behind the scenes,"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I remember somebody at our label kept telling me"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"how every time they'd see Columbia people,"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"they were hyper-competitive."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"And I was kinda like, why, we're on an indie label."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"- Probably these Ivy League bands."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"- Yeah."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"- Just going in on it, throwing shade."
01:25:48;01:25:48;"- I mean, that's why--"
01:25:48;01:25:49;"- 'Cause they're from Wesleyan, right?"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- They went to Wesleyan."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"That's why I'm all for canceling college"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"'cause it makes the bad worse, and it makes the good bad,"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"especially these types of schools."
01:25:57;01:25:59;"- Perpetuates these class hierarchies, man."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"- It's (beep) up, man."
01:26:00;01:26:00;"Anyway."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"- Anyway."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"- Anyway, no, I always (beep) with MGMT."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"- Yeah."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"- They're a good band, I (beep) with their second album."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"- Yeah."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"- I listened to the new one a little bit,"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"and I was like, these guys, they write songs and--"
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- They're doing their thing."
01:26:11;01:26:12;"- They're doing their thing."
01:26:12;01:26:13;"- You heard it here, folks."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"- MGMT, solid group."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"Back to '84."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"So you had Dancing Queen, ABBA, Strong Start."
01:26:18;01:26:19;"- Strong Start."
01:26:19;01:26:20;"- But I got Eurythmics."

01:26:25;01:26:29;"- March 24th, 1984, I was--"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"- In utero."

01:26:31;01:26:33;"I was two weeks out from being born."
01:26:33;01:26:33;"- Okay."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- But I remember this."

01:28:06;01:28:07;"No."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"- I wouldn't quite call it a ballad,"

01:42:41;01:42:44;"- Is that fretless bass or is that like a synth?"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"- Sounds like a synth."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"- My uncle Ted is really into fretless bass."
01:42:49;01:42:50;"- I love fretless bass."

01:43:49;01:43:52;"of a very wealthy New Jersey man"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"pursuing a working class Jersey girl."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"With Bruce, it'd be even funnier"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"just like doing his like Broadway show"
01:43:59;01:44:02;"and just talking about like all his like iconic songs."
01:44:02;01:44:05;"He'd be like, ""A lot of people assume that all my songs,"
01:44:05;01:44:08;"you know, are about working class guys."
01:44:08;01:44:12;"But one thing people don't know is 'I'm on Fire'"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"is actually about a very rich guy"
01:44:14;01:44:18;"just kind of having a rough week, man."
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Those guys get it bad too."""
01:44:19;01:44:23;"Actually, the video of this is the same as ""Uptown Girl."""
01:44:23;01:44:27;"The ""I'm on Fire"" video is Bruce plays a mechanic"
01:44:27;01:44:30;"and like a hot rich woman brings her like sick car"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"into the shop."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- Wow."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"- It's actually like a really sad dark video."
01:44:34;01:44:38;"And like, then at night he fixes the car up real good."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"And then he drives the car to deliver it at her house,"
01:44:40;01:44:41;"like to special delivery."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"And he goes up to the door and like, it's at night,"
01:44:44;01:44:45;"he's like about to knock on the door"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"to like say what's up to her."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"And then he kind of thinks better of it and just walks away."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"- I've never seen the video."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"- That anecdote makes the song,"
01:44:54;01:44:57;"that's why I'm not a fan of music videos."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"Like the song is so atmospheric and like open and beautiful."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"- And you don't know if it's a working class guy"
01:45:01;01:45:02;"or a rich guy?"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"- Or a middle class guy."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"I mean, he could be, have a stable career"
01:45:07;01:45:08;"in the insurance industry, you know?"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"I mean, no, I'm-"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"- The river is about a working class guy."
01:45:12;01:45:17;"Born in the USA is actually about a middle class guy."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"The guy from born in the USA,"
01:45:18;01:45:21;"later after he got back from Vietnam,"
01:45:21;01:45:24;"he went to work at ConAgra Foods,"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"worked his way up as an executive."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"- Did pretty well for himself."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"- Did pretty well."
01:45:28;01:45:29;"In ground pool."
01:45:29;01:45:32;"(laughing)"
01:45:32;01:45:38;"In ground pool."
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Song Mansion on the Hill is about how"
01:45:40;01:45:44;"if you work hard enough in this equitable nation,"
01:45:44;01:45:47;"you can get your own mansion on the hill."
01:45:47;01:45:50;"You can go from being a down and out Vietnam vet"
01:45:50;01:45:53;"to upper middle management at ConAgra."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"(laughing)"
01:45:55;01:45:59;"- That's such a novel, such a late 20th century,"
01:45:59;01:46:03;"I don't know if it's quite Philip Roth kind of,"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"like a Robert Stone novel or something."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"- And then his life falls apart somehow."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"But hanging over the whole story is how the big thing"
01:46:10;01:46:14;"that he's working on at ConAgra is acquiring Fiddle Faddle"
01:46:14;01:46:17;"to add to their Crunch and Munch portfolio."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"'Cause it's like the mid 80s and ConAgra has an obsession"
01:46:19;01:46:23;"with taking over the sweetened popcorn and peanuts market."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"- Playing the margins of the snack food industry."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"- We gotta buy Fiddle Faddle."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"- Where are we?"
01:46:29;01:46:29;"- In the top five?"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"- Yeah, are we 1977?"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"- Speaking of music videos, you know what,"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"maybe we'll do that on the next one."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"- Oh yeah, you had a video drop."
01:46:36;01:46:37;"- Yeah, but it's already been a while,"
01:46:37;01:46:40;"so we can give it a second life on the next episode,"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"but we dropped the Sunflower video,"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"which you still haven't seen, so we'll drop that next time."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Back to 1977."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"I mean, this is one of the strongest late 70s."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"This is crazy."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"- Enemy of the show."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"- Enemy of the show, but this is still a tight song."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Steve Miller."
01:46:56;01:47:02;"- Yeah, '77's a tight song."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"- It's crazy."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Although I will say,"
01:47:05;01:47:08;"because Steve Miller is enemy of the show now,"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"because he talked (beep) about Jerry after he died."
01:47:11;01:47:15;"When you compare this, which is a cool little pop song"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"that has some vibey moments and a good groove."
01:47:17;01:47:21;"If you compare this to what the dead were doing in '77."
01:47:21;01:47:22;"I mean, this-- - It's a joke."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"- It's a joke."
01:47:23;01:47:26;"In terms of psychedelia, in terms of surrealism,"
01:47:26;01:47:29;"in terms of exploratory, spacey, vibey stuff."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"- This is not exactly help on the way Slipknot."
01:47:32;01:47:33;"- Nope."
01:47:33;01:47:33;"- Franklin's Tower."
01:47:33;01:47:35;"- Not even close."
01:47:35;01:47:36;"- Jerry listening to this and being like,"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"that's a sweet little song, Steve."
01:47:38;01:47:38;"- Yeah."
01:47:38;01:47:42;"That's probably why Steve never got over it."
01:47:42;01:47:45;"He's like, hey Jerry, I finally wrote a cool psych jam,"
01:47:45;01:47:47;"fly like an eagle, and he's like, all right,"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"that's cool, man."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"- Steve Miller has a cool voice, though."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"All shade aside, Steve Miller has a dope voice."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"- We're getting a little too positive on Steve Miller,"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"and as of recording time,"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"he still has not publicly apologized to Jerry."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"- Or to us."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"- Or to us, the fans."
01:48:02;01:48:05;"More importantly, to us."
01:48:05;01:48:08;"Now, turns out Steve Miller's not the only person"
01:48:08;01:48:09;"to perform that song,"
01:48:09;01:48:12;"so we actually don't have to give him any more air time."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"We can play the version by Seal."
01:48:14;01:48:14;"- Whoa."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"- From Space Jam."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"- Interesting."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"- Which Time Crisis is gonna explicitly say"
01:48:20;01:48:23;"that we are issuing a statement"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"that the Space Jam version of Fly Like an Eagle by Seal"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"is now the definitive version of Fly Like an Eagle."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"- Far surpasses the original."
