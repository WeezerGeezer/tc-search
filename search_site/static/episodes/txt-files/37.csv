00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, Oscars Day, Jake's favorite day of the year. We'll be talking about"
00:06;00:10;"award season in LA. We'll also be getting a call from the fine people at Play"
00:10;00:16;"Network to tell us about the musical side of the global retail landscape. All"
00:16;00:23;"this, plus the new Chainsmokers featuring Coldplay song. I can't believe it. It's"
00:23;00:33;"finally here. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:16;01:22;"Time Crisis, Oscars edition. I guess we've come to the end of award season. How's"
01:22;01:28;"award season been treating you? How's it been treating me? Yeah. Pretty well. Some"
01:28;01:32;"people don't like award season. I remember just once somebody saying to me,"
01:32;01:38;"""You know, I really like LA, except award season."" That person is probably either"
01:38;01:43;"BSing or they're in some like very rarefied circle where everyone they know"
01:43;01:48;"is like, what, stressed out about award season? I don't roll in those circles, so"
01:48;01:52;"I'm like, ""Yeah, oh, Oscars are on Sunday? Oh, cool. I'll go over to my friend Chris's"
01:52;01:57;"house and watch those. Sounds great."" Crack a brew. Yeah. Watch the Oscars. I love the"
01:57;02:03;"Oscars. Do you? Yeah, totally. I mean, I like movies. I just got to say that"
02:03;02:09;"seemed like a very funny character trait. Jake's interest, just like Modellos,"
02:09;02:15;"just listen to some Eagles. Classic rock. Classic rock. But he loves- Counting Brews and"
02:15;02:20;"the Oscars. The film industry's biggest night. The glitz, the glamour. Who's hosting?"
02:20;02:25;"Who's wearing what? Oh, you know, Kimmel. Oh, Kimmel. All right. Kimmel's funny. Yeah, he's funny."
02:25;02:29;"Dude, speaking of, how are the Grammys? Oh, yeah, well, that's what I was saying. We got to"
02:29;02:33;"talk about the Oscars, but we have to backtrack and talk about all of award season."
02:33;02:38;"Exactly. Last episode, we went deep on the Grammys. It was day of. You were going."
02:38;02:43;"Yeah, and now it's two weeks later, so the dust has settled. Nobody's talking"
02:43;02:48;"about the Grammys anymore except for us on Time Crisis. The Grammys, you know, like"
02:48;02:54;"I said, it was funny to go because I was this time only like tangentially a part"
02:54;02:58;"of it, so it's a really awkward time. I think we had to get there at 430."
02:58;03:04;"That is weird. So even just in terms of eating, you know, you do your thing, you"
03:04;03:09;"roll out. Late lunch. Yeah, you have like a late lunch, then you get in the car. We"
03:09;03:15;"went, we picked up Ariel and Danielle. Yep. Is this an Uber or Lyft car or what are we"
03:15;03:20;"doing? I don't know. My manager like booked a car for me. Well, like a black SUV?"
03:20;03:26;"Yes, exactly. Like a Tahoe. So we roll over in a Tahoe. Legit. We pick up Ariel and"
03:26;03:30;"Danielle. In the end, I went with like a pretty, I was thinking about wearing a"
03:30;03:36;"Blind Melon t-shirt under a jacket and I just went with something more neutral."
03:36;03:39;"Yeah, because that is like my favorite current t-shirt. I think you've probably"
03:39;03:43;"seen me wearing it. I don't think I have. Really? I just said like, you know what, I"
03:43;03:47;"don't need to like rep Blind Melon at the Grammy. It's like trying a little hard."
03:47;03:52;"Maybe it would have been seen as trying hard. Like if you ended up on stage with a Blind Melon t-shirt, it would have been like, bro."
03:52;04:01;"Down a notch. Especially behind Beyonce. Right. I'm like, what is this f***ing idiot's deal? So anyway, I just, I went more"
04:01;04:06;"traditional. Just like dark, you know, comfortable, but dark wear. Dark clothes. I"
04:06;04:11;"saw you on TV. Oh, really? I was watching it with Dave. Oh, nice. And we were like, oh, there's Ed's in our front row."
04:11;04:15;"We did have pretty good seats. At one point, I was sitting right behind Ed Sheeran."
04:15;04:20;"Did you discuss bed sheets? No, we didn't discuss bed sheets."
04:20;04:24;"That's Jake and I's favorite line from his current song. I did watch him perform that song live."
04:24;04:35;"Did you talk at all? No. No FaceTime with Sheeran? No, I don't really know him. I think once I shook his hand at an event. I was mostly talking to Diplo."
04:35;04:44;"Okay. Yeah, so like you get, so then by the time you get there, it's like five, I think it started at five or 530. And then it's like three hours."
04:44;04:50;"So it's like right in the middle of like when you'd be hungry. Right. So you get kind of like lightheaded towards the middle."
04:50;04:56;"Are people drinking? Rihanna was. Are there breaks where people can go out and get a cocktail?"
04:56;05:04;"No, this is what's also super random is that it's at the Staples Center, you know, where like the Clippers play and the, you know. Yeah."
05:04;05:13;"And so they have the facilities to be serving hot dogs, pretzels, nachos, nachos, and probably also like, you know, this is like LA."
05:13;05:20;"Staples Center, you could probably get sushi, filet mignon, everything, but literally everything is closed."
05:20;05:28;"Like even the bars, like I was so hungry at one point when I went out to take a break, I would have just like pounded a fountain Coke."
05:28;05:35;"Just for the calories? Yeah. Carb load. You know, just like when you're starving, a fountain Coke starts to feel like a meal."
05:35;05:42;"So I was just super hungry. You did not plan your day right. I didn't plan it that well. I would have been hitting like a burrito at three."
05:42;05:48;"And then just been like set for the day. Yeah, but you know, I also don't want to get like burrito bloat on camera."
05:48;05:53;"I don't want you and Dave at home being like, wow, look at that puffy fool sitting behind Ed Sheeran."
05:53;05:59;"Fair enough. Okay. Three tacos. We had a couple snacks."
05:59;06:08;"We had a couple snacks on us, but like no flask. No, we had like a Matt's Munchies."
06:08;06:14;"Oh man, I don't want to drink a thing like that. Right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I just didn't even think about like bringing a flask."
06:14;06:22;"So then you're just like sitting there watching it. And as we talked about last time, you know, the best seat in the house is the lazy boy in your living room."
06:22;06:27;"Because even when you're sitting up front, you're still craning your neck to see this and that you can't really tell what's going on."
06:27;06:33;"So, for instance, when Metallica and Lady Gaga played and I was like, man, I can't hear Hetfield's voice."
06:33;06:38;"And I was like, it's probably OK on the live broadcast. Turns out it wasn't. We were texting."
06:38;06:43;"Yeah, we were texting a little bit during that. That was a fun performance. I really like Katy Perry's performance."
06:43;06:48;"Yeah, I thought that was very imaginative. But anyway, you just like kind of sitting there and."
06:48;06:52;"So how close to Metallica were you? We were on the other side."
06:52;06:57;"OK. Ariel and Danielle were sitting closer to Metallica. That performance ruled."
06:57;07:01;"I remember we were a little skeptical of the Metallica Gaga combo."
07:01;07:05;"You know, it makes sense. They went straight speed metal. I didn't write a song."
07:05;07:11;"I remember Colin saying it was like, like the new stuff's good. And it was great."
07:11;07:14;"I was so in. It was cool."
07:14;07:19;"We."
07:20;07:21;"I."
07:27;07:34;"♪ ♪"
07:34;07:41;"♪"
08:16;08:18;"You're listening to..."
08:18;08:22;"Time Crisis on Beat One."
08:22;08:24;"So then you're just like waiting and waiting,"
08:24;08:28;"and it's like really funny that the album of the year is the final award, obviously."
08:28;08:32;"And here's the thing, I really didn't have much ego at stake,"
08:32;08:39;"because even if Lemonade won, it'd be more like a funny footnote that I won a Grammy Award."
08:39;08:44;"Also, remember we were talking about I was nervous about whether or not it was appropriate to go up on stage?"
08:44;08:45;"Yeah, yeah."
08:45;08:47;"So I asked my manager, ""What do you think?"""
08:47;08:49;"And he was like, ""Ask Diplo."""
08:49;08:53;"And I was like, ""I don't think Diplo is going to have some special perspective on this."""
08:53;08:57;"But as we were sitting there, I kept being like, ""If she wins, are we going to go up?"""
08:57;09:00;"And he kept [ ] with me and being like,"
09:00;09:04;"""Yeah, well, if she wins, we got to run upstage. It'll take her a second to get on stage."
09:04;09:07;"So we should run up if we want to say anything."""
09:07;09:08;"And I was like, ""What are you talking about?"""
09:08;09:10;"He's like, ""Oh, I'm just [ ] with you."""
09:10;09:13;"And then I was like, ""No, but seriously, should we go up at all?"""
09:13;09:17;"And I looked around, and I could tell that The Weeknd had left,"
09:17;09:19;"because The Weeknd wasn't sitting in his assigned seat."
09:19;09:20;"Yeah."
09:20;09:22;"Maybe he left after his performance."
09:22;09:26;"I'm like, ""Kendrick wasn't there. Two people who are prominent features on the record."""
09:26;09:28;"So I was like, ""Those guys aren't going to be on stage."
09:28;09:32;"Definitely not going to go up and be on stage with me and Diplo in the background."""
09:32;09:35;"And then at one point, I was like, ""Yo, it was getting closer to the end."""
09:35;09:37;"And I was like, ""Seriously, what if she wins?"""
09:37;09:39;"And he was like, ""I don't know, man. I'm thinking about leaving."""
09:39;09:40;"And I was like, ""Really?"""
09:40;09:44;"So he just like-- Then I was like, ""All right. Let's just think about this."
09:44;09:45;"Should we go up?"""
09:45;09:46;"He's like, ""We'll just play it by ear."""
09:46;09:47;"I was like, ""Man."""
09:47;09:50;"And then finally, we look at each other, and we're like, ""Let's not go up."""
09:50;09:53;"We're like, ""You know what? It's cool we were part of this,"
09:53;09:56;"but who cares? We don't need to be on stage."""
09:56;09:58;"So there's no one else you could run interference with?"
09:58;10:01;"No. I mean, I could have walked over to Beyoncé."
10:01;10:04;"Hey, should I go up if you win?"
10:04;10:05;"Yeah."
10:05;10:06;"Oh, my God."
10:06;10:07;"No, of course not."
10:07;10:09;"But see, that's the thing. It's very unofficial."
10:09;10:12;"And also, I really thought she was going to win."
10:12;10:14;"I swear I thought she was going to win."
10:14;10:17;"Really? Because on the show, you thought-- I mean, when we did the show--"
10:17;10:19;"I was being diplomatic. I really thought she was going to win,"
10:19;10:23;"and I really thought-- I just thought she was going to win."
10:23;10:26;"And then there was a point when Diplo and I were just sitting there."
10:26;10:32;"A guy with a headset came over to us and said-- this is towards the end--"
10:32;10:34;"""Hey, so you guys are going to be coming on stage pretty soon."""
10:34;10:37;"Now, it might have been noisy. Maybe I misheard it."
10:37;10:40;"But it really sounded like this dude came up to us, like an official Grammy dude,"
10:40;10:42;"and said, ""You guys are going to be coming on stage soon,"
10:42;10:45;"so I just want to make sure you're here and you have a clear path to the stage."""
10:45;10:49;"And I was like, ""Oh, well, we were not sure if we're going to go up."""
10:49;10:51;"And he's like, ""All right."" And walked away."
10:51;10:53;"And then me and Diplo looked at each other and we're like,"
10:53;10:55;"""Did he just tell us that she's going to win?"""
10:55;10:57;"Whoa. I guess he just meant--"
10:57;11:00;"He didn't know, probably. I bet it was contingency."
11:00;11:03;"Right. He just chose to phrase it in a funny way."
11:03;11:05;"But anyway, I was kind of like, ""Oh, maybe they are going to win."""
11:05;11:08;"But at least we made our decision. We're not going to go on stage."
11:08;11:11;"Beyonce's probably going to give a very personal speech."
11:11;11:13;"But here's the thing."
11:13;11:15;"You're blind melon tea."
11:15;11:17;"Oh, yeah. If I was in the blind melon tea."
11:17;11:25;"And rest in peace, Shannon Hoon, if I may."
11:25;11:27;"[laughs]"
11:33;11:54;"All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watching the butterflies gather in"
11:54;12:05;"my hair And speak my point of view, but it's not safe"
12:05;12:18;"I just want someone to say to me, you know I'll always be there when you wait"
12:18;12:29;"I don't like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made"
12:29;12:39;"And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain, but there's no"
12:39;12:49;"light in here And all I can do is read a book to stay awake"
12:49;12:55;"And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape"
12:55;13:06;"Escape, escape, escape"
13:06;13:31;"Escape, escape, escape"
13:31;13:43;"All I can say is that my life is pretty plain You don't like my point of view, but I'm insane"
13:43;13:51;"It's not safe, it's not safe"
13:51;14:04;"I just want someone to say to me, you know I'll always be there when you wait"
14:04;14:15;"You know I like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made"
14:15;14:24;"And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I don't understand why I sleep all day"
14:24;14:34;"And I don't understand why I sleep all day"
14:34;14:40;"People were surprised that, or maybe not surprised, but people were upset that Adele won."
14:40;14:45;"I was upset that Arielle won."
14:45;14:48;"But it seems like completely by the book for the Grammys, right?"
14:48;14:49;"You know..."
14:49;14:52;"Anything that's a little bit edgy and idiosyncratic, they're not gonna..."
14:52;14:57;"Well, this has been a major point of debate and conversation since then, because a lot"
14:57;15:03;"of people have been accusing the Grammys of being racist, or at the very least conservative."
15:03;15:04;"Sure."
15:04;15:08;"So I think there's definitely a feeling like this is great work by like a prominent black"
15:08;15:12;"artist, a very famous, very loved and respected one."
15:12;15:15;"And also Beyonce's never won, so I think there really was a feeling of like what's wrong"
15:15;15:16;"with the system."
15:16;15:17;"Yeah."
15:17;15:20;"And I had conversations about people in the music community, because I genuinely, that's"
15:20;15:23;"what I wanted to win, and I was genuinely curious about it."
15:23;15:28;"So the guy who runs the Grammys did an interview afterwards where he was basically saying like,"
15:28;15:30;"look, it's a democratic process."
15:30;15:31;"Right."
15:31;15:33;"Because it's actually not that hard to vote in the Grammys."
15:33;15:36;"All you need is to have a credit on an album that was released."
15:36;15:38;"You could probably vote in the Grammys, Jake."
15:38;15:39;"Wait, what do you mean?"
15:39;15:40;"That year or ever?"
15:40;15:41;"I think ever."
15:41;15:44;"And then you gotta pay dues, like 80 or 100 bucks or something a year."
15:44;15:46;"Wait, wait a second."
15:46;15:47;"Let's back up."
15:47;15:48;"Yeah."
15:48;15:51;"I've been credited on albums, because I've played on them."
15:51;15:52;"Yeah."
15:52;15:53;"Small albums."
15:53;15:54;"But that were officially released?"
15:54;15:55;"Are they in the iTunes store, for instance?"
15:55;15:56;"Absolutely."
15:56;16:01;"Well, my friend, I'd like to invite you to join the Academy of Recording Sciences."
16:01;16:03;"What are the annual dues?"
16:03;16:05;"I'm thinking like 80 to 150."
16:05;16:06;"Thousand?"
16:06;16:07;"No, no."
16:07;16:08;"It's dollars, straight up."
16:08;16:09;"Really?"
16:09;16:10;"So I could vote?"
16:10;16:11;"Probably."
16:11;16:12;"What?"
16:12;16:16;"So basically, this guy was like, this guy, Neil Portnow, was basically saying,"
16:16;16:18;"it's a democratic process."
16:18;16:20;"Because they were basically like, what do you have to say?"
16:20;16:22;"Like, do you think you have a race problem?"
16:22;16:23;"This was on Pitchfork."
16:23;16:25;"They were like, do you have a race problem with the Grammys?"
16:25;16:26;"He was like, no."
16:26;16:28;"I mean, it's a democratic process."
16:28;16:29;"This is what people voted for."
16:29;16:32;"Are there like tens of thousands of people voting?"
16:32;16:37;"So he said there's 14,000 members currently, which actually seems low."
16:37;16:39;"Because I bet there could be more members."
16:39;16:41;"There could be like 100,000."
16:41;16:42;"OK, hold on, Jake."
16:42;16:44;"So this is the specific--"
16:44;16:46;"OK, a little research from Nick here."
16:46;16:49;"Yeah, this is the specific qualifications needed for a voting member."
16:49;16:50;"OK."
16:50;16:54;"Recording Academy voting members are professionals with creative or technical credits"
16:54;16:58;"on at least six commercially released tracks."
16:58;17:01;"These may include vocalists, conductors, songwriters, composers, engineers,"
17:01;17:03;"producers, instrumentalists, arrangers, archers."
17:03;17:07;"So anyway, Jake, have you played guitar on six released--"
17:07;17:08;"Yes."
17:08;17:10;"OK, you could join the Academy."
17:10;17:13;"There are also some people, like one of the guys from the Village People,"
17:13;17:16;"put out a statement where he was like, I know that there's a secret committee"
17:16;17:18;"that makes the final decision."
17:18;17:21;"Oh, it's like the Illuminati?"
17:21;17:22;"Illuminati."
17:22;17:23;"Illuminati?"
17:23;17:26;"The conspiracy theories of Grammy commission?"
17:26;17:28;"I'd love to know if that's true."
17:28;17:29;"You know, it's funny."
17:29;17:33;"We were talking later, I was talking to somebody who was also very surprised"
17:33;17:37;"and dismayed that Beyonce had lost, and I actually said the opposite."
17:37;17:38;"Maybe I'm just naive."
17:38;17:40;"I said, you know what, though?"
17:40;17:45;"This proves to me that the voting is real because if they had a lick of sense"
17:45;17:47;"and they could control it, they would have given it to Beyonce."
17:47;17:48;"Sure."
17:48;17:51;"Maybe that's me being naive and assuming that they would want to do that."
17:51;17:53;"Wait, so you voted?"
17:53;17:54;"No, I didn't vote."
17:54;17:58;"Oh, this is just like a microcosm of our larger problem of civic engagement."
17:58;18:00;"I do feel bad about it now because--"
18:00;18:01;"Why didn't you vote?"
18:01;18:02;"I'll tell you."
18:02;18:07;"In the past, I had a superstition like I didn't want to vote when I was nominated."
18:07;18:10;"I didn't want to vote for somebody else either, but I didn't want to vote."
18:10;18:13;"That's like the end of the film Election."
18:13;18:15;"Oh, right, trying to do the right thing."
18:15;18:17;"He's like, I don't want to--you can't vote for yourself."
18:17;18:19;"Yeah, losing by one vote."
18:19;18:23;"But this year, I was like, you know what, Vampire Weekend's not nominated."
18:23;18:27;"Yes, I'm tangentially nominated via Beyonce, but I was like, I want to vote for her."
18:27;18:31;"So I kept waiting for my ballot to come, and I didn't get it."
18:31;18:33;"So then finally I just hit up a guy at my management."
18:33;18:35;"I was like, hey man, did my ballot come?"
18:35;18:37;"And he was like, no."
18:37;18:39;"Are you sure you're registered?"
18:39;18:40;"Is it a paper ballot or an email?"
18:40;18:45;"Basically, I was under the impression that my organization was paying my dues yearly."
18:45;18:47;"Turns out they weren't."
18:47;18:51;"So by the time I realized this, I was disqualified from voting."
18:51;18:53;"I did encourage people to vote for Beyonce."
18:53;18:54;"Yeah, so whatever, I messed up."
18:54;18:56;"I'm part of the problem."
18:56;18:59;"But also, there's so many--see, that's something I was wondering about."
18:59;19:03;"If this guy's right, and truly it's a democratic process,"
19:03;19:06;"and I think that's a pretty reasonably low bar,"
19:06;19:09;"is that you just have to be somebody who played on six songs."
19:09;19:13;"So I'd love to know, like, the way people talk about the Grammys--"
19:13;19:15;"let's assume that there's no conspiracy for a second."
19:15;19:16;"Yeah."
19:16;19:17;"There might be."
19:17;19:18;"I don't think there is."
19:18;19:19;"Let's just table that for a second."
19:19;19:20;"Let's assume it's straightforward."
19:20;19:23;"The way people talk about it is like, the Grammys are corrupt."
19:23;19:25;"It's really closer to something that needs to get out the vote."
19:25;19:28;"I was thinking it'd be interesting if a journalist did an article"
19:28;19:31;"where they were like, hit up like 100 different professional musicians"
19:31;19:33;"and say, ""Who did you vote for, for the big categories?"""
19:33;19:34;"Right."
19:34;19:36;"And there's like, it's a 20% voter turnout."
19:36;19:37;"Yeah."
19:37;19:41;"If everybody who's ever played on six tracks votes,"
19:41;19:44;"that should not be disproportionately old white guys."
19:44;19:45;"No, not at all."
19:45;19:46;"I mean, it's funny."
19:46;19:49;"Do you think that, like, James Hetfield voted--"
19:49;19:50;"Yeah, that's a great question."
19:50;19:52;"--to return to Metallica or whoever?"
19:52;19:56;"I mean, do you think like, Jay Maskis votes in the Grammys?"
19:56;19:59;"Like, the bass player from Mudhoney."
19:59;20:01;"Yeah."
20:01;20:05;"And if so, did the bass player from Mudhoney vote for Adele?"
20:05;20:06;"Hello?"
20:06;20:08;"Did Mac DeMarco vote?"
20:08;20:09;"Right."
20:09;20:10;"Did Ray Schrammert vote?"
20:10;20:11;"Did Kendrick vote?"
20:11;20:13;"I'm thinking about the young people."
20:13;20:15;"Did Camila Cabello vote?"
20:15;20:17;"Did Ariel vote?"
20:17;20:19;"Probably voted for himself."
20:19;20:20;"[laughs]"
20:20;20:23;"[music - ""lucky""]"
20:47;20:52;"Look in the mirror, who do you see?"
20:52;21:05;"Someone familiar, surely not me."
21:11;21:15;"For he can't be me."
21:15;21:19;"Look how old, and cold, and tired, and lonely he's become."
21:19;21:30;"Not until you see there's a price tag hanging off"
21:30;21:32;"of having all that fun."
21:38;21:45;"Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
21:45;21:58;"Oh, no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
22:04;22:09;"Walk on the outside, holding her hand."
22:09;22:22;"Someone familiar, her and her man."
22:28;22:32;"But it just can't be."
22:32;22:37;"Look at all the steps that brought you where you are today."
22:37;22:47;"Not until you see, as a heart grows stronger,"
22:47;22:50;"sometimes love is pushed away."
22:55;23:02;"Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
23:02;23:15;"Oh, no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
23:21;23:28;"Uh-oh, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
23:28;23:41;"Oh, no, looks like I'm seeing more of my old man in vain."
23:41;23:48;"Well, the Oscars are this Sunday."
23:48;23:49;"The Oscars are this Sunday."
23:49;23:53;"And so I think some people are maybe anticipating a callback"
23:53;23:57;"to the Grammys with maybe La La Land playing the role of Adele"
23:57;24:03;"and La La Land issuing an apology from the stage to Moonlight."
24:03;24:06;"Do you think that the La La Land people would actually do that?"
24:06;24:09;"I don't think that Damien Chazelle or whatever,"
24:09;24:11;"who made La La Land, would do that."
24:11;24:12;"And he shouldn't, it's fine."
24:12;24:16;"But I just remember seeing on Twitter as soon as Adele won"
24:16;24:19;"that people are already making that sort of parallel."
24:19;24:20;"Have you seen all the movies?"
24:20;24:24;"The analogy kind of breaks down because Beyoncé is a legend."
24:24;24:28;"And it was clear that even Adele was like uncomfortable with her own victory."
24:28;24:30;"This is just two movies by two young filmmakers."
24:30;24:32;"You know, weirdly, I feel the opposite way."
24:32;24:37;"I feel like it's harder to compare music, and it's easier to compare movies."
24:37;24:41;"Like at the end of the day, I prefer the Beyoncé album."
24:41;24:43;"But at the same time, if somebody made a case to me,"
24:43;24:47;"""Well, here's what I liked about the Adele album and why Adele as an artist speaks to me more,"""
24:47;24:51;"I might be like, ""Hey, whatever floats your boat, man."""
24:51;24:54;"Whereas if somebody tried to tell me that La La Land was better than Moonlight,"
24:54;24:57;"I actually would put my foot down and just be like, ""No, it's not."
24:57;24:59;"It most certainly is not, my friend."""
24:59;25:00;"Yeah, no, I agree."
25:00;25:05;"And I'm trying to think why I feel that way because albums are so much about personality."
25:05;25:12;"And even though I wanted it to win, I just can't say fundamentally Lemonade is better than 25."
25:12;25:17;"I can say reasons why it's more progressive or more exciting."
25:17;25:21;"But if somebody said, ""Yeah, but what I'm looking for in a movie is the type of like--I don't know."""
25:21;25:25;"A nostalgic throwback to a dead genre."
25:25;25:27;"That's what I'm looking for."
25:27;25:30;"Just to me, I don't know. Moonlight's just better than La La Land."
25:30;25:31;"Do you disagree?"
25:31;25:32;"No, I agree with you."
25:32;25:36;"If somebody wanted to say to me, ""Within their respective worlds,"
25:36;25:41;"Beyoncé and Adele equally did their thing."
25:41;25:47;"Beyoncé made the perfect 2016 Beyoncé album,"
25:47;25:51;"and Adele made the perfect 2016 Adele album."
25:51;25:53;"They maxed out each of their artistic potentials."
25:53;25:55;"They're on different paths."""
25:55;25:57;"Again, I would kind of buy that."
25:57;26:03;"But I believe that Moonlight truly is just like one of the best, for lack of a better word, indie,"
26:03;26:07;"like vibey indie movies I've seen in years."
26:07;26:14;"And La La Land is not the best throwback genre revival that I've seen."
26:14;26:16;"It's not even the best musical."
26:37;26:39;"So, okay, did you see this thing with Santana?"
26:39;26:41;"Mm-mm."
26:41;26:42;"Oh, man."
26:42;26:44;"He was doing some interview after the Grammys."
26:44;26:46;"I wonder if they asked him, ""Did you vote in the Grammys?"""
26:46;26:47;"People got to start asking, ""Did you vote?"""
26:47;26:49;"Just remind people, ""Did you pay your dues?"""
26:49;26:51;"They got to ask six months before."
26:51;26:53;"Dude, okay, this is a project for next year on the show."
26:53;26:55;"I'm going to become a member."
26:55;26:56;"Oh, that's a great idea."
26:56;26:58;"I'm going to pay my $100."
26:58;27:00;"I'm going to vote."
27:00;27:01;"We're going to vote on air."
27:01;27:04;"Maybe you could even get into, like, the rock committee."
27:04;27:05;"I'd love to."
27:05;27:07;"What's that band that you like a lot?"
27:07;27:08;"Sheermag?"
27:08;27:09;"Yeah."
27:09;27:10;"Sheermag's got to get nominated."
27:10;27:14;"How is Sheermag not nominated for best rock album?"
27:14;27:17;"So they're interviewing Santana, who may or may not have voted."
27:17;27:18;"Yeah."
27:18;27:21;"And they're like, ""What do you think about Adele beating Beyoncé?"""
27:21;27:28;"And he said something to the effect of, like, ""You know, Beyoncé is cool, but Adele can sing."""
27:28;27:34;"And then he said something about, like, ""Beyoncé is more like a model who also""--"
27:34;27:35;"Am I quoting correctly?"
27:35;27:37;"Does that sound about right?"
27:37;27:38;"I'm not going to look it up."
27:38;27:40;"So basically he compared Beyoncé to a model."
27:40;27:41;"Huh."
27:41;27:45;"I guess he's trying to say she's more about the visuals, whereas Adele can sing."
27:45;27:46;"Huh."
27:46;27:47;"And--"
27:47;27:48;"That's really splitting hairs."
27:48;27:49;"Well, and first of all--"
27:49;27:52;"I mean, they both sing like maniacs."
27:52;27:53;"I mean, they're both virtuosos."
27:53;27:59;"You could maybe point to certain things that Adele does better, Beyoncé does better."
27:59;28:00;"Singing is not one of them."
28:00;28:01;"Right."
28:01;28:03;"There's no universe where--"
28:03;28:09;"Like, even if Santana said something like, ""What really moves me is a simple piano ballad,"""
28:09;28:16;"""whereas the post-modernity of a Beyoncé song is confusing to my old ears,"""
28:16;28:17;"Yeah, yeah."
28:17;28:18;"Whatever."
28:18;28:19;"It's like, that's just your opinion, man."
28:19;28:20;"Well, then that'd be fine."
28:20;28:25;"But I just don't think there's any judgment in the world where you could say that Adele is a better singer than--"
28:25;28:29;"Maybe he just meant that, like, he just liked her voice more."
28:29;28:30;"Well, maybe."
28:30;28:32;"He got in trouble and he apologized."
28:32;28:34;"Apologized?"
28:34;28:42;"But do you think Beyoncé gives one, like, crap about Carlos Santana's opinion?"
28:42;28:44;"That's so funny."
28:44;28:46;"Like, who's he apologizing to?"
28:46;28:47;"To the world."
28:47;28:55;"Imagine, like, Beyoncé's management being like, ""Yo, Carlos Santana, he said he liked Adele's voice more than yours."""
28:55;28:57;"Jay-Z and Beyoncé are sitting at the breakfast table."
28:57;28:59;"Okay, moving on."
28:59;29:02;"They're sitting at the breakfast table."
29:02;29:06;"Maybe Beyoncé-- maybe, like, Beyoncé is just like, ""You know what?"
29:06;29:08;"I did this, like, killer performance at the Grammys."
29:08;29:09;"I won some."
29:09;29:10;"I lost the big one."
29:10;29:12;"I'm not trying to, like, be on the internet today."
29:12;29:14;"I'm just going to, like, enjoy it myself."""
29:14;29:21;"But, like, Jay's got his phone out and he just sees, like, Carlos Santana says Adele can sing and Beyoncé's a model."
29:21;29:23;"And he's like, ""Mm."""
29:23;29:25;"She's like, ""What, honey?"""
29:25;29:30;"And he's just like, ""Mm, nothing."""
29:30;29:31;"I'd be confused if I was her."
29:31;29:34;"I'd just be like, ""Shut the f--- up, Santana."""
29:34;29:42;"She fires back with, ""Well, Carlos Santana peaked in 1973 when he made that 'Love Supreme' album with John McLaughlin."""
29:42;29:48;"What about the fact that Santana can't even sing himself?"
29:48;29:49;"There you go."
29:49;29:50;"You know what?"
29:50;29:53;"If Rob Thomas, who sang ""Smooth""--"
29:53;29:54;"Oh, that's the worst song."
29:54;29:55;"Oh, that's a good song."
29:55;29:56;"Oh, my God."
29:56;29:57;"That's the worst."
29:57;29:58;"Look."
29:58;29:59;"""Shots Fired."""
30:00;30:01;"Are you serious?"
30:01;30:02;"Are you in those ""Smooth""?"
30:02;30:03;"""It was a hot one."""
30:03;30:04;"Oh, my God."
30:04;30:06;"""Like seven inches from the midday sun."""
30:06;30:08;"Seven inches?"
30:08;30:10;"That's the lyric, man."
30:10;30:13;"""Man, it's a hot one."
30:13;30:18;"Like seven inches from the midday sun."""
30:18;30:21;"Time crisis."
30:21;30:26;"""Now I have become Death Destroyer of Worlds."""
30:26;30:28;"So Santana never sang?"
30:28;30:29;"Not really."
30:29;30:31;"A lot of people don't realize this."
30:31;30:33;"""I've got a black magic woman."""
30:33;30:34;"Like the dude, the other dude."
30:34;30:35;"Right."
30:35;30:38;"I'm not trying to say that I can say conclusively that Santana never sang."
30:38;30:40;"I'm sure he got on the mic every now and then."
30:40;30:42;"But his hits?"
30:42;30:44;"I saw Santana live in Switzerland once."
30:44;30:45;"Whoa, whoa, okay."
30:45;30:46;"Get into that."
30:46;30:48;"And he just has like a--"
30:48;30:51;"I was at the Montreux Jazz Festival, and Santana was headlining one night."
30:51;30:53;"Was Vampire playing?"
30:53;30:54;"Vampire has played there."
30:54;30:55;"The Jazz Festival."
30:55;30:57;"Vampire has played the Jazz Festival twice."
30:57;30:59;"And then once I just went as a civilian."
30:59;31:00;"How?"
31:00;31:02;"And I watched Santana."
31:02;31:04;"He basically has a dude who just sings all the songs."
31:04;31:05;"Right."
31:05;31:10;"So ""Oye Como Va,"" this like 30-year-old dude in a suit sings it."
31:10;31:12;"""Black Magic Woman,"" that dude sings it."
31:12;31:14;"""Smooth,"" that dude sings it."
31:14;31:22;"So anyway, I just want to be like, if Carlos Santana was discussing John Mayer"
31:22;31:26;"losing to any other modern guitarist--"
31:26;31:28;"Wait, no, who's the blues guy that played there that night?"
31:28;31:29;"Gary Clark Jr."
31:29;31:31;"So if John Mayer loses to--"
31:31;31:34;"Or let's say John Mayer beats Gary Clark Jr."
31:34;31:36;"Just so that there's the same racial dynamics at play."
31:36;31:38;"And they say, ""Carlos Santana, what do you think about this, man?"
31:38;31:39;"Is this racism?"""
31:39;31:43;"And Carlos Santana just says, ""Well, from where I sit as a guitar legend,"
31:43;31:46;"John Mayer can play."""
31:46;31:49;"Honestly, that would still be lame."
31:49;31:52;"That would be so--"
31:52;31:55;"Yo, but all the old heads respect John Mayer as a player."
31:55;31:56;"Yeah, I'm sure he's great."
31:56;31:58;"He's doing the Jerry stuff now."
31:58;31:59;"He's cool, man."
31:59;32:03;"I respect John Mayer more as a songwriter, but these old heads are just like--"
32:03;32:04;"The old heads are like--"
32:04;32:05;"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
32:05;32:07;"Slow down."
32:07;32:08;"I'm going to stop you right there."
32:08;32:12;"You respect John Mayer more as a songwriter than a guitar player."
32:12;32:15;"He has a few good songs, man."
32:15;32:16;"[exhaling]"
32:16;32:20;"I keep waiting, waiting on the world to change."
32:20;32:21;"That song's pretty tight."
32:22;32:24;"And there's another song in that album called ""Heart of Life."""
32:24;32:25;"Do you know this one?"
32:25;32:26;"I don't know."
32:26;32:27;"Wait, play it."
32:27;32:29;"It's almost like a Lindsey Buckingham song."
32:29;32:30;"All right, hold on."
32:33;32:36;"This could almost be like some late period Lindsey."
32:36;32:39;"It's like some 2004 Lindsey Buckingham."
32:39;32:42;"Dude, those 2000s Buckingham albums are good."
32:42;32:43;"""Under the Skin."""
32:43;32:45;"Oh, yeah, I know this one."
32:45;32:48;"[imitating guitar]"
32:48;32:51;"I think Rostam first played this for me back in the day."
32:53;33:02;"(SINGING) I hate to see you cry, lying there in that position."
33:02;33:03;"John Mayer can sing."
33:03;33:04;"[laughing]"
33:04;33:10;"(SINGING) Things you need to hear, so turn off your tears"
33:10;33:14;"and listen."
33:14;33:19;"Pain throws your heart to the ground."
33:19;33:25;"Love turns the whole thing around."
33:25;33:30;"No, it won't all go the way it should."
33:30;33:35;"But I know the heart of life is good."
33:35;33:52;"You know it's nothing new."
33:52;33:59;"Bad news never had good timing."
33:59;34:03;"But then the circle of your friends"
34:03;34:10;"will defend the silver lining."
34:10;34:15;"Pain throws your heart to the ground."
34:15;34:21;"Love turns the whole thing around."
34:21;34:22;"I mean, it's like pleasant."
34:22;34:24;"It's kind of got a Fleetwood vibe."
34:24;34:26;"John Mayer, ""The Heart of Life."""
34:26;34:29;"Here's what I was saying, is the Santana thing"
34:29;34:35;"got me wondering, is it possible that a lot of these old head"
34:35;34:38;"musician dudes, regardless of race,"
34:38;34:41;"have that same kind of just like old school feeling?"
34:41;34:44;"This is the type of stuff we'll never know until we dig in."
34:44;34:47;"And again, I think racial bias definitely is a factor."
34:47;34:49;"But I'm also kind of wondering, like,"
34:49;34:52;"you think Santana is a guy who's all about genre experimentation"
34:52;34:54;"and teaming up with different--"
34:54;34:55;"Yeah, yeah."
34:55;34:58;"You think Santana would be able to wrap his head around"
34:58;35:02;"why a Beyonce record maybe is more exciting to some people."
35:02;35:06;"But is it possible that just for some of these old people,"
35:06;35:09;"maybe men and women of all different races"
35:09;35:12;"who are voting in the Grammys, just like even some old jazz"
35:12;35:14;"dude or something, they see the Adele thing,"
35:14;35:17;"they see the black and white cover, they listen."
35:17;35:18;"It's austere."
35:18;35:19;"It's sounds they're familiar with."
35:19;35:22;"And they're just like, whoa, that girl can sing."
35:22;35:24;"And then they hear a Beyonce song like ""Formation,"""
35:24;35:27;"and they're just like, I don't get it."
35:27;35:32;"I mean, maybe Santana never got hip to hip hop."
35:32;35:33;"It's possible."
35:33;35:34;"Straight up, you know?"
35:34;35:37;"I could picture Santana in the mid '80s, like,"
35:37;35:40;"hearing rap music and just being like--"
35:40;35:41;"Oh, man."
35:41;35:42;"And then just--"
35:42;35:43;"Oh, man, these guys can't sing."
35:43;35:45;"Yeah, and then like turning his brain off"
35:45;35:47;"and never opening back up."
35:47;35:49;"We got to be careful as we grow older"
35:49;35:51;"not to turn our brains off."
35:51;35:52;"I'm trying."
35:52;35:53;"You get away now, Jake."
35:53;35:54;"You're in your 40s now, man."
35:54;35:55;"You got to be careful."
35:55;35:58;"I was recently, late night, looking"
35:58;36:03;"at the Wikipedia page of the artist JJ Cale."
36:03;36:05;"Because I just didn't know that much about him."
36:05;36:08;"He's kind of like a bluesy rock guitarist"
36:08;36:09;"who Eric Clapton really liked."
36:09;36:11;"He wrote a lot of songs that Eric Clapton--"
36:11;36:14;"[HUMMING ""COCAINE""]"
36:14;36:15;"""Cocaine?"""
36:15;36:16;"Yeah."
36:16;36:17;"So he's like this really respected dude,"
36:17;36:19;"a little bit of a cult figure."
36:19;36:21;"And so I was just reading about his career."
36:21;36:25;"I'm always fascinated to learn about the rock elder's careers."
36:25;36:29;"And so he released an album in 1983 called Number 8"
36:29;36:31;"that underperformed."
36:31;36:33;"And then he didn't release another album"
36:33;36:34;"until the early '90s."
36:34;36:36;"Because I guess like, you know, so he's probably"
36:36;36:38;"approaching middle age at that point."
36:38;36:39;"He like killed it in the '60s and '70s."
36:39;36:41;"And then it's early '80s."
36:41;36:43;"And he drops a dud."
36:43;36:46;"And he's probably starting to think like, eh, OK, maybe"
36:46;36:47;"I'm supposed to do something else."
36:47;36:49;"So he takes seven, eight years off from releasing music."
36:49;36:51;"And then later he did an interview."
36:51;36:54;"And they were like, J.J. Kell, man, '80s were kind of like"
36:54;36:56;"a lost period for you, man."
36:56;36:57;"What did you do in the '80s?"
36:57;37:01;"And he said, mowed the lawn, listened to a lot of Van Halen"
37:01;37:03;"and rap."
37:03;37:04;"And I was like, whoa."
37:04;37:05;"That's tight."
37:05;37:06;"I said, that's cool, man."
37:06;37:07;"Like, I really respect that."
37:07;37:08;"Like, you hit middle age."
37:08;37:10;"Maybe you don't know what to do with yourself."
37:10;37:12;"Your music's not connecting with people anymore."
37:12;37:13;"Take a step back."
37:13;37:16;"Listen to the new-- learn about rap."
37:16;37:18;"Clapton's not listening to rap in the mid '80s."
37:18;37:21;"Yeah, a lot of those older white rock guys"
37:21;37:24;"were like incredibly derogatory towards rap."
37:24;37:25;"We talked about that."
37:25;37:26;"Rap's crap."
37:27;37:28;"Like, these Leonard Skynard type dudes."
37:28;37:30;"And like, J.J. Kell, he's really associated"
37:30;37:33;"with the old style rock."
37:33;37:36;"So I thought that was really cool that people were like, man,"
37:36;37:37;"what happened to you?"
37:37;37:38;"You just fell off."
37:38;37:40;"And he's like, no, man, I was just mowing the lawn,"
37:40;37:41;"taking care of my house."
37:41;37:43;"And I was listening to the new stuff, Van Halen and rap."
37:43;37:44;"It's cool."
37:44;37:45;"That's a great image."
37:45;37:47;"Like, him putting on like a Walkman."
37:47;37:49;"Or like a Run-DMC tape."
37:49;37:50;"Just like, wow, man."
37:50;37:52;"And just cranking it over the mower."
37:52;37:54;"Yeah."
37:54;37:55;"Like on the Ryder mower."
37:55;37:56;"No, totally."
37:56;37:57;"Yeah."
37:57;37:59;"I am the king of rock."
37:59;38:00;"Fire."
38:00;38:02;"Sucka MCs should call me Sire."
38:02;38:05;"To rule my kingdom, you must use fire."
38:05;38:07;"I won't stop rocking till I retire."
38:07;38:09;"Now we rocked up parties and come correct."
38:09;38:12;"All cuts are on time and rhyme connect."
38:12;38:14;"Got the right to vote and we'll elect."
38:14;38:17;"And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect."
38:17;38:20;"[music - ""the real deal""]"
38:20;38:43;"They call ourselves, we're getting niller."
38:43;38:45;"It's not Michael Jackson."
38:45;38:46;"And this is not Duff."
38:46;38:47;"It's one death rapper."
38:47;38:48;"I know I can hang."
38:48;38:51;"I'm ruffin' Run-DMC like Cooper Cool in the gang."
38:51;38:53;"Road to the rock, rock to the roll."
38:53;38:56;"DMC's the devil, they've got control."
38:56;38:58;"You can't touch me with a tip foot pole."
38:58;39:01;"And I even make the devil sell me his soul."
39:01;39:05;"Soul, soul, soul, soul."
39:05;39:08;"Now we crash through walls, up through floors,"
39:08;39:10;"bust through ceilings, knock down doors."
39:10;39:13;"Now when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box."
39:13;39:15;"You can hear our sound, four blocks and blocks,"
39:15;39:18;"for every living person, we're a fun old trick."
39:18;39:19;"It's me and DMC."
39:19;39:20;"J wears the beat."
39:20;39:24;"Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat."
39:24;39:27;"[music - ""the real deal""]"
39:27;39:32;"Now we're the baddest of the bad."
39:32;39:34;"Coolest of the cool, I'm DMC, I rock and roll."
39:34;39:35;"The DJ run our rock and rule."
39:35;39:38;"It's not a trick or treat, and it's not a April Fool."
39:38;39:41;"It's all brand new, never ever old school."
39:41;39:44;"[music - ""the real deal""]"
39:44;39:53;"You got the music in your box, and you can't comprehend"
39:53;39:56;"when your mind won't rhyme and your knees won't bend."
39:56;39:58;"Music ain't nothing but a people jam."
39:58;40:01;"It's DJ Run, DMC, rocking without a band."
40:01;40:06;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
40:06;40:08;"There's some really exciting guests coming up, Jake."
40:08;40:10;"We're going to take a break from talking about awards season"
40:10;40:14;"to talk about the Play Network."
40:14;40:16;"Are you familiar with the Play Network?"
40:16;40:17;"No."
40:17;40:19;"This is one of these major companies"
40:19;40:22;"that affects your life in a very fundamental way."
40:22;40:24;"You've never even heard of them, man."
40:24;40:28;"The Play Network helps brands use entertainment media"
40:28;40:30;"to engage customers in-store and beyond."
40:30;40:33;"In other words, they're picking out the songs."
40:33;40:39;"We've talked a lot about who's picking the songs at Home Depot."
40:39;40:44;"And also, how come at CVS, it's always Yacht Rock?"
40:44;40:45;"Right."
40:45;40:48;"And then Home Depot, it's Tropical House."
40:48;40:53;"Yeah, Home Depot, I think it's going to be Van Halen and Neil Young."
40:53;40:55;"It's basically the top five off Time Crisis."
40:55;40:56;"Right."
40:56;41:00;"And CVS is always old music."
41:00;41:03;"We're going to talk to John Krug, the VP of Global Brand Development,"
41:03;41:05;"and Julia Cummings, Director of Music Services."
41:05;41:08;"But before we get them on the phone, let's get into a little history."
41:08;41:12;"Play Network was founded by Kevin Rebell in 1996."
41:12;41:15;"Anything founded in 1996 is automatically hilarious."
41:15;41:17;"Tight."
41:17;41:20;"Just like Jake's Pizzeria since 1996."
41:20;41:23;"Jake's Burrito Hut since '96."
41:23;41:26;"As a music programmer for the Tom Selleck-owned nightclub"
41:26;41:28;"Black Orchid in Honolulu, Hawaii--"
41:28;41:29;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
41:29;41:31;"--during the 1980s."
41:31;41:34;"And during this job, Kevin noticed the synergetic relationship"
41:34;41:37;"between customers, music, and their environment."
41:37;41:38;"Wait, what?"
41:38;41:40;"The synergetic relationship between customers, music?"
41:40;41:44;"So, like, you're at a bar, and they're playing, like, good music."
41:44;41:46;"He noticed."
41:46;41:47;"Right."
41:47;41:49;"Oh, they're playing good music here."
41:49;41:51;"And it makes people feel good."
41:51;41:52;"Yeah, okay."
41:52;41:53;"You're at a bar."
41:53;41:54;"That's just like a funny--"
41:54;41:56;"You're at a bar, the vibe is terrible, and then suddenly you hear"
41:56;42:00;"""Ba-ba-ba-bump, it's the beginning of 'Smooth' by Santana featuring Rob Thomas,"""
42:00;42:04;"and suddenly, ""Brain, oh, do-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na."""
42:04;42:06;"Not '96, bro."
42:06;42:07;"Okay."
42:07;42:08;"I'm just giving you an example."
42:08;42:11;"No, but it's a funny thing to be like, ""Oh, wow, like,"
42:11;42:14;"someone's playing good music at this nightclub."
42:14;42:16;"This is a business."""
42:16;42:19;"Yeah, he was a disruptor."
42:19;42:22;"It might seem kind of obvious, but sometimes the most obvious things"
42:22;42:24;"create empires."
42:24;42:25;"True."
42:25;42:27;"In 1998, the company established Play Network in Seattle with his brother"
42:27;42:31;"Gordon as a digital music provider for businesses."
42:31;42:34;"In 1998, Play Network began a partnership with Starbucks to provide"
42:34;42:39;"digital music systems and service to over 1,800 retail locations in North America."
42:39;42:43;"By 2001, the company was providing services to more than 3,500"
42:43;42:45;"international locations."
42:45;42:49;"Oh, so we can talk about the Starbucks playlist with this guy."
42:49;42:50;"Yeah, I mean--"
42:50;42:51;"I love it."
42:51;42:53;"What do you picture when you go into Starbucks?"
42:53;42:54;"I mean, it's a coffee shop."
42:54;42:55;"It's almost a genre of music."
42:55;42:57;"I picture, like--"
42:57;42:59;"I might be wrong here."
42:59;43:03;"Death Cab for Cutie."
43:03;43:04;"No, am I wrong?"
43:04;43:07;"Maybe like a Portland one."
43:07;43:08;"Maybe it's different location."
43:08;43:09;"Okay, we got to talk to these guys."
43:09;43:14;"No, dude, I picture, like, very safe, tasteful indie music."
43:14;43:15;"Yeah, maybe sometimes."
43:15;43:18;"But also, like, you know, Gillian Welch."
43:18;43:19;"John Mayer?"
43:19;43:22;"For sure."
43:22;43:24;"I mean, like, what do you picture?"
43:24;43:26;"Jazz."
43:26;43:28;"Like, straight up, like, kind of blue?"
43:28;43:29;"Or, like, what kind of stuff?"
43:29;43:34;"Like Vince Guaraldi trio, Peanuts, jazz, Peanuts Christmas."
43:34;43:37;"I don't know if I picture jazz in a Starbucks."
43:37;43:38;"Smooth jazz?"
43:38;43:42;"No, that would be too De Classe."
43:42;43:44;"Yeah, maybe, like--"
43:44;43:45;"It's, like, chill--"
43:45;43:46;"Yeah, no, no, I picture it's, like--"
43:46;43:47;"Like singer-songwriter."
43:47;43:49;"Singer-songwriter, but, like, late period stuff."
43:49;43:50;"You're like, what--"
43:50;43:51;"Like a new Emmylou Harris album."
43:51;43:52;"Yeah, exactly."
43:52;43:53;"You're like, what is this?"
43:53;43:56;"And, like, this is an Emmylou Harris album from 2009."
43:56;43:57;"All right, well, let's talk to them."
43:57;43:58;"Let's talk to John and Julia."
43:58;44:02;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
44:02;44:06;"[phone ringing]"
44:06;44:07;"Hello, John and Julia."
44:07;44:08;"How's it going?"
44:08;44:09;"Hello."
44:09;44:10;"Hey, what's up, guys?"
44:10;44:14;"Thanks for calling in on behalf of Play Network."
44:14;44:16;"Yeah, happy to do it."
44:16;44:22;"So you guys are helping to put together the playlists that play in retail environments?"
44:22;44:23;"Yes, we do."
44:23;44:24;"Yeah, that's right."
44:24;44:29;"Julia, I will jump the line and speak on her behalf."
44:29;44:38;"Julia is the center of the universe when it sort of goes into the music supervision curation mode with the team"
44:38;44:42;"and the one sort of head between the speakers every day with her team."
44:42;44:43;"But, yeah, that's what we do."
44:43;44:54;"We work with like 500 of the world's top retail brands and curate hand-picked music for their stores,"
44:54;44:59;"for digital, experiential, and everything in between."
44:59;45:00;"Who's your biggest partner?"
45:00;45:02;"Is it Starbucks?"
45:02;45:07;"Yeah, I would say Starbucks certainly is the largest brand we have."
45:07;45:09;"I mean, they've been a client of ours for 20 years."
45:09;45:14;"I mean, we're a global company now, but 20 years ago we were born out of Seattle,"
45:14;45:19;"so the Seattle connections run deep, and we signed Starbucks."
45:19;45:22;"I think, Julia, if I remember, there were 1,500 locations maybe,"
45:22;45:29;"and now Julia and the team are curating music in like 16,000 in 90 countries, 16,000 locations."
45:29;45:30;"Oh, my God."
45:30;45:35;"Yeah, but, you know, Starbucks, I mean, we're close to 500 brands today,"
45:35;45:44;"Starbucks, Levi's, Globally, Gap Brands, Forever 21, Marc Jacobs, Converse, Marriott, Adidas."
45:44;45:47;"So just to take Starbucks as an example so we can understand more how it works,"
45:47;45:52;"they must have some opinions about what they want playing in their cafes."
45:52;45:54;"How does the conversation work?"
45:54;45:59;"Usually it's a partnership, and the best scenarios work out where we're partnering together."
45:59;46:04;"So we work with the brand's investment and with their guidance and with their suggestions,"
46:04;46:08;"and they can be as involved as they want to be."
46:08;46:14;"So Starbucks obviously is hugely invested in music, so they give us a lot of direction,"
46:14;46:19;"and we support that direction with supplemental playlists and ideas around that,"
46:19;46:24;"and we fulfill licensing and a lot of the kind of not as sexy stuff as well,"
46:24;46:26;"just delivery of the music as well."
46:26;46:29;"I'm curious how specific these conversations get."
46:29;46:30;"Very."
46:30;46:34;"So someone at Starbucks is like, ""You know what? Neil Young is just too melancholy for Starbucks."
46:34;46:36;"We can't deal with Neil Young."""
46:36;46:40;"Or like early Joni Mitchell is too emotional."
46:40;46:43;"Oh, we get so specific you would laugh at the conversations we have."
46:43;46:46;"Okay, well, give me some details."
46:46;46:51;"Well, I mean, again, it's not specific to Starbucks. It's specific to all of our brands."
46:51;46:54;"We review every song in real time."
46:54;46:57;"People are listening to that song and tagging it with metadata,"
46:57;47:02;"tagging it from tempo to vocal quality to lyrics."
47:02;47:05;"So we really focus a lot on lyrics in our business"
47:05;47:10;"because when you're in an open space or a retail environment,"
47:10;47:13;"you're kind of held captive to that music."
47:13;47:15;"You can't change the channel like radio stations."
47:15;47:21;"So the lyrics are one of our biggest focuses, so we do spend a lot of time talking about lyrics."
47:21;47:26;"So that's why I say the conversations get really funny because we have some like HR,"
47:26;47:29;"you know, you have to sign off on HR to say that we're going to sit in the hallway"
47:29;47:34;"and debate the level of profanity of a word like ""poon-tang."""
47:34;47:41;"The level of where does something that maybe there's profanity, there's mild profanity,"
47:41;47:44;"there's sexual innuendo, there's drug innuendo."
47:44;47:47;"So all the conversation around lyrics is very, very important to us."
47:47;47:50;"And I think all of our brands take that very seriously."
47:50;47:53;"Will Starbucks allow the occasional F-bomb?"
47:53;47:58;"I don't think we have a brand that really allows profanity."
47:58;48:02;"But there's all levels of how edgy a brand wants to be."
48:02;48:07;"We have something that's like Gymboree where you have little kids in there and their parents shopping."
48:07;48:14;"Or we might have a brand like Converse or MAC Cosmetics who wants to be really edgy and progressive."
48:14;48:19;"So they might challenge the lyrics a little bit more and they might push it a little bit farther"
48:19;48:21;"and allow for some more mild profanity."
48:21;48:27;"And when we talk about mild profanity, we're talking about your damn, hell, ass, piss."
48:27;48:30;"These are the kind of conversations we have in meetings. They're pretty fun."
48:30;48:34;"But definitely not--that's not dropping even at Converse."
48:34;48:36;"Even at Urban Outfitters."
48:36;48:41;"Yep, even then. And in fact, when I'm shopping and just normal walking around,"
48:41;48:46;"if I hear swearing in a store, I'm always like, ""This is somebody's iPod they plugged in."""
48:46;48:48;"Right. I was actually thinking about that."
48:48;48:55;"Generally speaking, these places do not allow the employees to override,"
48:55;48:58;"plug in the old iPhone and start DJing."
48:58;48:59;"No."
48:59;49:02;"That would be like Starbucks' worst nightmare is like a barista just jacks in and starts--"
49:02;49:04;"Throwing some Slayer."
49:04;49:07;"Sure. And also it's illegal, right?"
49:07;49:08;"Wait, what?"
49:08;49:12;"Well, one of the parts of our business is that we pay royalties."
49:12;49:13;"Oh, right. Nice."
49:13;49:17;"Licensing. So all of our music is licensed before we can even play it."
49:17;49:20;"So we don't play music overhead that we haven't pre-cleared."
49:20;49:22;"Did you guys watch the Grammys two weeks ago?"
49:22;49:23;"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
49:23;49:25;"So just real quick, when you're watching the Grammys,"
49:25;49:28;"we were talking about some of our favorite performances earlier."
49:28;49:33;"You saw Metallica and Lady Gaga. Where could you see that going?"
49:33;49:36;"Well, Metallica is always tough."
49:36;49:41;"Any hard rock, any metal, anything like that is really tough to program"
49:41;49:46;"because, again, there's not a lot of retailers that want that really hard rock experience."
49:46;49:49;"I think something like that that was kitschy with Lady Gaga,"
49:49;49:54;"and I wish the audio worked because I thought that was kind of a genius idea."
49:54;49:57;"Because Lady Gaga's vocals have more of a pop sound to it,"
49:57;50:02;"I mean, that could be programmed in a more progressive brand like an Urban Outfitters"
50:02;50:06;"or Vans or something like that, but it would have to be indie enough sounding."
50:06;50:09;"You can't go for a full-on Metallica sound in a lot of brands."
50:09;50:12;"How about Adele, album of the year winner?"
50:12;50:13;"Everywhere, right?"
50:13;50:18;"Home Depot, Starbucks, Office Depot, Office Max."
50:18;50:20;"Well, that's why she won the Grammys."
50:20;50:21;"Olive Garden."
50:21;50:23;"She's so accessible."
50:23;50:30;"But now what's interesting about Adele this last year was her first big song was a ballad,"
50:30;50:36;"and that is an interesting one for our world because, again, clients really want upbeat, positive,"
50:36;50:44;"so really melancholy, bittersweet love songs that are ballads can sometimes be hard to place overhead,"
50:44;50:46;"even if it is a popular song."
50:46;50:49;"Right, so even ""Hello,"" this massive song."
50:49;50:51;"Yeah, you might not hear that."
50:51;50:55;"Which is why you don't hear Neil Young and Joni Mitchell at Home Depot."
50:55;50:59;"Yeah, maybe it might be there, exactly."
50:59;51:04;"But a remix of Adele doing ""Hello,"" get a Chainsmokers remix on there."
51:04;51:05;"No thanks."
51:05;51:08;"We talk about Chainsmokers a lot."
51:08;51:09;"Jake is not a fan."
51:09;51:10;"No, thank you."
51:10;51:11;"I am."
51:11;51:12;"How about Chainsmokers?"
51:12;51:18;"Again, depending on the brand, more of your fast fashion or your kind of trendy retail brands,"
51:18;51:22;"that's definitely going to get placed because there's brands that are indie and want discovery,"
51:22;51:27;"and then we also have really straight-ahead fashion brands where their audience is teenage girls"
51:27;51:32;"and they want to be playing all the hits, so songs like that are going to get played."
51:32;51:38;"Interestingly, their big song last year was also a little on the slower side for a dance song,"
51:38;51:41;"but it still had enough of a beat to get placed."
51:41;51:46;"My whole team actually observed that last year dance music slowed down quite a bit."
51:46;51:48;"Oh yeah, Tropical House."
51:48;51:49;"Which was great for us."
51:49;51:55;"Yeah, I mean it was great for us, for programming, because really that really hard banging beat of dance music"
51:55;52:01;"can be too energetic and too frenetic for a lot of retailers, so kind of that mid-tempo makes it more spectacle."
52:01;52:02;"Sweet spot."
52:02;52:09;"I don't know how familiar you are with my band Vampire Weekend, but I'm working on a new record right now."
52:09;52:15;"I know that we get played here and there, but I guess my question is, as I look to the future,"
52:15;52:19;"[laughter]"
52:19;52:20;"shameless!"
52:20;52:25;"do you have any advice on where does Vampire Weekend get played, and then also just generally,"
52:25;52:32;"do you have any advice about what I could do to maximize my retail potential for my music?"
52:32;52:33;"And obviously--"
52:33;52:37;"Wait, specifically where though? At Starbucks? At Chipotle? What are we talking?"
52:37;52:42;"We definitely have gotten played at Starbucks. They sold our CD once, which we really appreciated."
52:42;52:49;"Well I have to tell you right out, we now incorporate one of your songs into a lot of our Christmas playlists."
52:49;52:50;"Oh really?"
52:50;52:56;"I don't know if you know this, you are now part of the canon of holiday music."
52:56;52:57;"Oh thank God."
52:57;53:00;"I don't know, what song do you think? It's called, hmm, let me think, Holiday."
53:00;53:01;"Oh, Holiday."
53:01;53:04;"Oh, Holiday, Holiday!"
53:04;53:12;"You know what's funny is that when I wrote that song, I think I was originally thinking of it more as like--"
53:12;53:13;"Like a vacation."
53:13;53:16;"Like a vacation, like the British holiday. I was probably being pretentious."
53:16;53:20;"But then the first year it came out, we had two big ad campaigns."
53:20;53:26;"I'm like so stupid. They wanted to use it for their Christmas commercials, and even back then I was kind of like, why?"
53:26;53:30;"I was like, it's an upbeat third wave ska song."
53:30;53:33;"But, you know, it's funny I forgot about that, but I love that."
53:33;53:38;"Yeah, that's what makes it great actually, is that a lot of the holiday standards are played out,"
53:38;53:43;"or people do covers, so you have like 25 covers of I'll Be Home for Christmas."
53:43;53:51;"And so anything that's new and different, but also something that might be more secular and not religious or Christmas-based,"
53:51;53:56;"maybe more holiday-themed, like you're saying, like a holiday in Europe, just taking time off."
53:56;54:00;"Themes of home, themes of winter, those tend to get incorporated into holiday playlists."
54:00;54:01;"Interesting."
54:01;54:05;"But I noticed this year, your song was really like a standard."
54:05;54:06;"I was like, oh, it's everywhere."
54:06;54:10;"Whereas maybe earlier on, people were like, oh, this is fun, I'll add this in."
54:10;54:12;"And now, this last year--"
54:12;54:14;"Yeah, because that song's been-- that was on our second album."
54:14;54:18;"That song's been out for almost seven years now, so I'm glad to hear."
54:18;54:21;"There's a great Weezer song called Holiday, too, off the first album."
54:21;54:22;"Don't tell her about that, man."
54:22;54:25;"Not to steal your thunder."
54:25;54:27;"I know that one, too."
54:27;54:32;"But I would say, to your other question about how to be kind of more retail-ready,"
54:32;54:36;"a lot of the points I made earlier is that thinking about lyrics--"
54:36;54:38;"So no cursing."
54:38;54:39;"No cursing."
54:39;54:41;"No slagging off large-scale retailers."
54:41;54:44;"Yeah, probably not good to be anti-consumerist."
54:44;54:46;"I mean, again, you're making your art for art's sake,"
54:46;54:50;"so I would never suggest anyone create art for commerce' sake."
54:50;54:53;"But hey, if you want to go that direction, keep it positive."
54:53;54:59;"Avoid your themes of apocalypse, death, suicide, things like that."
54:59;55:00;"Avoid your profanities."
55:00;55:06;"And then, aside from lyrics being positive, upbeat is really the key."
55:06;55:08;"Right, but not too fast."
55:08;55:10;"Yeah, not too fast."
55:10;55:14;"I mean, we program music for spas, and there's all kinds of ethereal music we play,"
55:14;55:17;"but if you want to kind of get in that sweet spot, upbeat--"
55:17;55:21;"a lot of variance of tempo can hurt a little bit,"
55:21;55:25;"because if you have a one-minute slow intro, and then it ramps up,"
55:25;55:29;"and then it drops out, that can be really disjointed for retail,"
55:29;55:33;"because if you're in a store or a restaurant and the tempo drops out,"
55:33;55:35;"sometimes it can be perceived as silence."
55:35;55:39;"So you want the tempo to kind of stay consistent"
55:39;55:42;"because you've got all the ambient noise of a retail space."
55:42;55:44;"These are good pointers, Ezra."
55:44;55:47;"Ezra, what if you wrote an Office Depot concept album"
55:47;55:52;"where the entire concept of the album was to get it played in its entirety in Office Depots?"
55:52;55:53;"I love that."
55:53;55:57;"And it was just like--the first song was just like, ""I love Office Depot,"""
55:57;56:00;"and then the second song was about like donors and cartridges."
56:00;56:02;"It was just like a deep postmodern art project."
56:02;56:05;"I love that as an artistic concept, but Office Depot doesn't want that"
56:05;56:08;"because the consumer is going to walk in, they're going to keep hearing Office Depot,"
56:08;56:12;"and they're just going to be like--they're going to feel condescended to."
56:12;56:16;"You're going to marginalize yourself too because what happens to Staples?"
56:16;56:19;"What happens to all the other office supplies?"
56:19;56:21;"No, Jake, that's a terrible idea."
56:21;56:22;"No, it's not."
56:22;56:24;"That's cutting off your nose to spite your face."
56:24;56:26;"What if you had a Starbucks concept album?"
56:26;56:29;"Starbucks is the biggest coffee shop in the world."
56:29;56:32;"They have, what, 20,000 locations."
56:32;56:35;"Make a Starbucks concept album, although Office Depot is funnier."
56:35;56:37;"Well, thanks so much, guys."
56:37;56:40;"It's really interesting because I think this is like--"
56:40;56:43;"people just don't put a lot of thought into like this is your guy's whole job,"
56:43;56:46;"and I think a lot of people walk into Starbucks,"
56:46;56:51;"and they might have this misconception that the barista's calling the shots."
56:51;56:55;"But there's a lot of thought put into this on like a global scale."
56:55;56:58;"A lot, yes, definitely."
56:58;56:59;"Well, thanks so much, guys."
56:59;57:00;"Thank you."
57:00;57:01;"Yeah, thank you, guys."
57:01;57:03;"If there's anybody from Chipotle listening--"
57:03;57:04;"Or Office Depot."
57:04;57:06;"Or Office Depot."
57:06;57:08;"Hit up Play Network, and if they do hit you up,"
57:08;57:10;"can you bring Jake and I in as consultants?"
57:10;57:12;"Because we would love to program those two spots specifically."
57:12;57:14;"Oh, my God, I would love that."
57:14;57:15;"That would be so much fun."
57:15;57:16;"Thanks, guys."
57:16;57:18;"I can't wait to hear your Office Depot record."
57:18;57:20;"Oh, yeah."
57:20;57:22;"It's coming out later this year."
57:22;57:24;"All right, thanks, guys."
57:24;57:25;"All right, take care."
57:25;57:26;"Bye."
58:58;59:05;"I am become Death Destroyer of World's Time Crisis"
59:05;59:07;"with Ezra Koenig."
59:07;59:09;"Wow, Jake, that was a fascinating call."
59:09;59:10;"Yeah, that was great."
59:10;59:16;"At first, I kind of wondered, is having a giant company"
59:16;59:18;"programming the music for all these retail spaces"
59:18;59:21;"kind of like taking away originality?"
59:21;59:23;"It'd be kind of interesting, I guess,"
59:23;59:26;"if you walked into a Starbucks and the teen barista there"
59:26;59:30;"was just playing their favorite SoundCloud or whatever,"
59:30;59:32;"some unsigned artist."
59:32;59:35;"That might give it a sense of more personality and variety."
59:35;59:38;"Honestly, it sounds like a tight job."
59:38;59:41;"No, I would love to do the music for Home Depot."
59:41;59:42;"Yeah."
59:42;59:43;"That's like a pipe dream."
59:43;59:44;"I know, but I feel like deep down,"
59:44;59:46;"you probably wouldn't like all the red tape,"
59:46;59:47;"because you'd probably be like--"
59:47;59:50;"you'd probably like the conceptual nature of being like,"
59:50;59:52;"listen, dude, it's Home Depot."
59:52;59:54;"We got to be playing more Bob Seger in here."
59:54;59:55;"Yep."
59:55;59:58;"And then everyone's like, no, we're not going to play Bob Seger."
59:58;01:00:01;"We want to play up-tempo, electronic-based whatever."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"And then you'd be like, come on, man."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"And they'd just be like, no."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"You'd probably have to be very diplomatic in that job."
01:00:07;01:00:11;"Let's play some mid-'70s Dylan deep cuts."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Anyway, shout out to Play Network."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"We were talking a little bit before about the Chainsmokers."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"Jake, you still seem to have a problem with the Chainsmokers, man."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"I don't know if it's a problem."
01:00:21;01:00:24;"You know, earlier we were talking about these older rock guys,"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"Santanas of the world, who just don't get it."
01:00:26;01:00:31;"He just doesn't get Beyonce because he just can't understand how amazing she is."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"And you said you don't want to be that guy."
01:00:34;01:00:38;"Is it possible that you're that guy with the Chainsmokers?"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"It's possible, but I don't think so."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"I heard--"
01:00:42;01:00:48;"Because it's like very sort of bottom-of-the-barrel bass pop songwriting."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"Bottom-of-the-barrel."
01:00:49;01:00:54;"There's no sense of an adventurous genre or harmonic adventure."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"There's no risk-taking."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"Yeah, not enough flat fives?"
01:00:59;01:01:00;"None of jazz chords for you?"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"No, no, no. It's not that."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"You want more key changes?"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"What do they have to do to win you over, man?"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Some more augmented--"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"Some augmented ninths."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Okay, but hold on."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"You don't like Chainsmokers, but you do like Coldplay."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"No."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"You don't like Coldplay?"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"No. Are you?"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Yeah, I always liked Coldplay."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Yeah?"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"No, I'm not a Coldplay fan."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Wait."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"You didn't even like Yellow, their first single back in the day?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Yellow's-- I can get down with it."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"I remember specifically delivering pizzas,"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"hearing Yellow on the Alt Rock station in Portland,"
01:01:32;01:01:36;"and being like, ""Okay, these guys are mining this territory."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"I've heard it a billion times."""
01:01:38;01:01:39;"But you're like, ""This is good."""
01:01:39;01:01:40;"""I'm down with it."""
01:01:40;01:01:41;"""This is pretty good."""
01:01:41;01:01:42;"Yeah."
01:01:42;01:01:45;"And then they just got like--"
01:01:45;01:01:46;"And then you just super Starbucks'd out."
01:01:46;01:01:51;"Delivering a pizza, the late '90s, early 2000s,"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"just listening, ""This is pretty good."""
01:01:52;01:01:53;"Yeah."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"Just like--"
01:01:54;01:01:58;"Hope these dudes never link up with the Chainsmokers, though."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"I can tell you that."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"Smash cut, 17 years out."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"17 years later."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"You don't like Clocks?"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"[humming]"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"No, God, I hate that."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"You didn't like--"

01:02:26;01:02:28;"That song sounds like Kate Bush."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"No, that's interesting."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"I can kind of see that."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"All right, now you--"
01:02:31;01:02:36;"Anyway, Coldblade teamed up with the Chainsmokers."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"That's big."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"Man, what are the odds?"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"Is it big?"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"What are the odds that you're going to like this song,"

01:16:58;01:17:00;"but I think it stems from the same impulse,"

01:17:03;01:17:06;"I don't know about cavemen, but like Vikings and stuff,"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"you know, there's definitely--when you like go into battle,"

01:28:25;01:28:26;"All right, here's one thing."
01:28:26;01:28:30;"I'm sure this is a super serious documentary."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"And then they just like stick a song in the closing credits."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"Yeah, just like the credits, just like, oh."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"One thing about the Oscars,"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"maybe this is true of the Grammys too,"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"with the Oscars, there's definitely--"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"it's a very, very small group of people"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"who I think are in charge of like these categories."
01:28:44;01:28:45;"Yeah."
01:28:45;01:28:49;"So I think it's not that hard to like get your--"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Yeah."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Your rando song nominated."
01:28:51;01:28:55;"If you're like a, you know, big gun like Sting."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Yeah."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"It's that--"
01:28:57;01:29:01;"So was James Foley like beheaded by Al Qaeda or something?"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"I'm sure he was--"
01:29:02;01:29:03;"He was kidnapped in Syria."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Yeah, he was beheaded."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"You think Sting wrote a song for that?"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Yeah, honestly--"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"It's so uncomfortable."
01:29:10;01:29:15;"I mean, look, if the family of James Foley--"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"yeah, like I don't want to speak out of turn."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"It's possible--"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"Yeah, totally."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"It's possible that they were like,"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"it's an honor that Sting wrote a song for this documentary."
01:29:21;01:29:24;"But that's totally up to them."
01:29:24;01:29:28;"They're allowed to honor their lost family members."
01:29:28;01:29:31;"Like, just like me personally, if that happened to me,"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"if I like lost a family member and there's a documentary"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"about it, especially in such a grisly way--"
01:29:35;01:29:38;"It's-- no, thank you."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"But that's personal."
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Yeah."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"That's personal."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"So anyway, that-- I don't know."
01:29:43;01:29:45;"We can't comment on that anymore."
01:29:45;01:29:49;"Back to 1981, this happens a lot in the Oscars."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"There are two songs from the same movie nominated."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"9 to 5?"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"No, also from Fame."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"Oh, OK."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"So Irene Cara sang the song Fame."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"She also sang the song Out Here On My Own."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"I don't know if I know it."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"I guess it's like the ballad."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Oh, matches."
01:30:10;01:30:13;"So it's 1981 was the first time this ever happened."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"They had two songs from the same movie."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"Really?"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"First time ever?"
01:30:19;01:30:23;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"I thought like Sound of Music or something."
01:30:25;01:30:29;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:30:29;01:30:37;"(SINGING) We're always proving who we are."
01:30:37;01:30:47;"Always reaching for that rising star to guide me far"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"and shine me home."
01:30:50;01:30:57;"I'm on my own."
01:30:57;01:30:58;"All right."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"I thought the drums would have come in there."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:31:04;01:31:10;"I close my eyes so I can be with you."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Oh baby."
01:31:11;01:31:16;"Someone in this world loves this song."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"This is someone's favorite song."
01:31:18;01:31:21;"I bet this song doesn't end up on a lot of retail playlists,"
01:31:21;01:31:21;"though."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"No."
01:31:22;01:31:22;"Too heavy."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"Too slow."
01:31:23;01:31:36;"[MUSIC - IRENE CARA, ""OUT HERE ON MY OWN""]"
01:31:36;01:31:36;"This is like--"
01:31:36;01:31:45;"Can I get a foot-long tuna with extra onions on the honey wheat"
01:31:45;01:31:45;"baguette?"
01:31:45;01:31:50;"Do you want sliced tomatoes?"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Uh."
01:31:53;01:31:53;"Yeah."
01:31:54;01:31:54;"Thank you."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"Pepperoncini?"
01:31:56;01:31:56;"No."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"Too spicy."
01:31:59;01:32:00;"Jalapenos."
01:32:00;01:32:07;"Sir, you got to insert your credit card."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"No, you can't swipe it."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"No, it's a chip."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"You got to insert it."
01:32:11;01:32:15;"This is so brutal."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Anyway."
01:32:17;01:32:21;"Irene Cara nominated-- well, I guess actually the songwriters"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"are the ones who were nominated."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"That song was written by Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"You don't hear a lot of names like Dean Pitchford anymore."
01:32:30;01:32:34;"That's just a good old 1981 early Reagan administration name."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Hey, Ezra."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"Nice to meet you."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"Dean Pitchford."
01:32:37;01:32:41;"What's up, dude?"
01:32:41;01:32:43;"Oh, hey, I'm Dean."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"Dean Pitchford."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Hey, man."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"Dean."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"[LAUGHS]"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"I mean, it's a tight name."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"Don't get me wrong."
01:32:49;01:32:52;"If I met a guy named Dean Pitchford, I'd be like,"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"what's your story, man?"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Let's get a brew."
01:32:55;01:32:58;"Now batting for the Milwaukee Brewers, Dean--"
01:32:58;01:32:59;"no, it doesn't work--"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"Dean Pitchford."
01:33:00;01:33:04;"It works in like the '70s."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"Bottom of the ninth."
01:33:06;01:33:08;"Relief pitcher Dean Pitchford on the hill."
01:33:08;01:33:11;"The brewers are bringing in Dean Pitchford."
01:33:11;01:33:15;"Is this going to win them the 1975 World Series?"
01:33:16;01:33:20;"Anyway, Dean Pitchford, hell of a lyricist."
01:33:20;01:33:26;"Back to 2017, Jake, are you familiar with the film Moana?"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"No, wait, what's-- sorry, what film?"
01:33:28;01:33:29;"Moana."
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Is it another doc?"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"No, it's an animated film."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Oh, I don't watch animated films."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"Well, yeah, to be fair, they're marketed to children."
01:33:37;01:33:40;"But adults-- a lot of adults go to see them now."
01:33:40;01:33:41;"I don't have children."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"No, but I'm saying a lot of adults go to see them."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"You know, like, you probably know some people who are like,"
01:33:46;01:33:49;"also don't have kids, but they're just like, oh, we're--"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"Let's go see Wally."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Yeah, we're going to get stoned and see Wally."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Nah, I was not going to stop."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"I did watch Wally stoned once at home."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"I fell asleep about 15 minutes in, but the first 15 minutes,"
01:33:58;01:34:01;"I was just like, yo, this is a good movie."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"This is dystopic, dude."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"This is a good movie, man."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"I can't connect with animation."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"Really?"
01:34:07;01:34:08;"I just can't connect."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"OK, so maybe this movie's not for you."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"OK."
01:34:11;01:34:16;"The music and lyric for this song from Moana"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"is by a guy named Lin-Manuel Miranda."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"OK."
01:34:19;01:34:20;"Who's that?"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"Hamilton."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Right."
01:34:22;01:34:23;"Yeah."
01:34:23;01:34:24;"Never saw the show."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"You never saw Hamilton?"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"Have you seen it?"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"I feel sorry for you."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Have you seen it?"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Yeah."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"You saw it?"
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Of course."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"I don't know."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"I saw Hamilton."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"How was?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"It's good."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"I'm sensing some hedging there."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"OK, I'm hedging a little bit only because--"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"This is like almost socially unacceptable"
01:34:41;01:34:45;"to say anything but glowing things about Hamilton."
01:34:45;01:34:49;"I was very surprised by--"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"this guy clearly is very talented, Lin-Manuel Miranda."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"I don't know."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"I just never fully got into it."
01:34:56;01:34:58;"And then I just felt a little bit left out"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"when other people I knew were just like--"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"it was incredible, right?"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"Did you cry?"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"And I was like, ah."
01:35:04;01:35:06;"And I do like musicals."
01:35:06;01:35:07;"You're like, it was cool."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"Yeah, I was like, it's cool."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"It's cool."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Anyway, maybe Moana will be what wins me over."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"You were in the minority there, bud."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"I was in the extreme minority."
01:35:15;01:35:18;"So as often is the case with songs,"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"there's the version from the movie."
01:35:20;01:35:24;"This one was-- this is the version from the movie."
01:35:24;01:35:28;"It's called ""How Far I'll Go."""
01:35:28;01:35:34;"Sting on lead vocals?"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"How far I'll go."
01:35:36;01:35:40;"I've been staring at the edge of the water"
01:35:40;01:35:47;"long as I can remember, never really knowing why."
01:35:47;01:35:49;"It's such like a musical melody."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Yep."
01:35:50;01:35:52;"Never knowing why."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"Or maybe it's like the diction."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"It's very formal."
01:35:55;01:35:57;"Yeah, because you need to understand the words."
01:35:57;01:35:59;"Yeah, real stiff."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"That's why there's never going to be like a--"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"This is why I hate musicals."
01:36:03;01:36:06;"There's never going to be like a grunge musical."
01:36:06;01:36:07;"Right."
01:36:07;01:36:08;"You can't understand a word."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Right."
01:36:09;01:36:10;"Well, they could have like a subtitle,"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"like LED display above the stage."
01:36:13;01:36:19;"Alive, a musical based on the music of Eddie Vedder"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"and Pearl Jam."
01:36:21;01:36:25;"It tells the story of a young surfer."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"When I feel."
01:36:27;01:36:31;"What they all know."
01:36:31;01:36:35;"If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"All right, but I also want to play--"
01:36:36;01:36:42;"they did like a pop version by Alessia Cara or Cara."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"That was like the movie version."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"This is the Chainsmokers version."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Yeah, the version we heard,"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"that's the one that you go take the kids to the theater."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"Yeah."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"This is for after you put the kids to bed"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"and you and your significant other"
01:36:56;01:37:00;"are just talking about your day."
01:37:00;01:37:04;"You're pouring yourself a little tequila."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"The kids are asleep."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"Puffing on that medicinal joint a little bit."
01:37:10;01:37:11;"That's right."
01:37:11;01:37:15;"The kids are asleep, Jennifer."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Want to go out on the patio."
01:37:16;01:37:18;"So this is a different singer."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Yeah, this is Alessia Cara."
01:37:27;01:37:36;"We got a visit from the regional manager on Monday."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"Todd's freaking out."
01:37:42;01:37:50;"Terry told me that Todd's freaking out."
01:37:50;01:37:51;"I didn't even see Todd today,"
01:37:51;01:37:56;"but Terry was telling me that Todd's super stressed."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Oh, look, there's a drop."
01:37:58;01:38:00;"Jim from regional's coming in."
01:38:00;01:38:04;"You think this is the first Disney song that had a drop?"
01:38:04;01:38:07;"This is like the Chainsmokers version."
01:38:10;01:38:13;"Hey, I just tried to tell Todd to calm down."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"[Laughter]"
01:38:15;01:38:18;"All right, so that was from Moana."
01:38:18;01:38:23;"Back to 1981, there was a film called The Competition,"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"and Randy Crawford performed a song"
01:38:25;01:38:28;"that was written by Lalo Schifrin."
01:38:28;01:38:29;"Oh, Lalo Schifrin, dude."
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Yeah, a real OG film composer."
01:38:31;01:38:32;"Mission Impossible."
01:38:32;01:38:35;"Lyric by Wilbur Jennings."
01:38:35;01:38:36;"It's called People Alone."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"What is the movie called?"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"The Competition."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"Never heard of it."
01:38:39;01:38:40;"Really?"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"Have you?"
01:38:41;01:38:42;"No, I've never heard of it."
01:38:45;01:38:46;"Take me along."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"Oh, God, this stuff."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"I don't care."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"It's kind of similar to that."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Yeah, very similar."
01:38:52;01:38:53;"Life in Tata Time."
01:38:53;01:38:57;"And I don't have to know exactly how to love."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"This might be my least favorite kind of music."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"This is also like, it's such a specific tone."
01:39:01;01:39:04;"It really reminds me, it's like, it's not a sad ballad."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"It's that kind of like,"
01:39:05;01:39:10;"Everything on your mind will turn to music."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"This is like the part, well, I don't think this is a musical,"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"but this reminds me of those songs they have in musicals"
01:39:15;01:39:19;"that are like usually about 20, 30 minutes in,"
01:39:19;01:39:23;"where like finally you're alone with the main guy or girl,"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"and they get to go sing in their room and be like,"
01:39:25;01:39:32;"I want things to be different because I could be better than this."
01:39:32;01:39:35;"Like musicals always have that moment."
01:39:35;01:39:42;"See me, feel me, touch me."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"And I know that the other people in the village"
01:39:45;01:39:51;"probably think it's funny that I believe that I could accomplish something different."
01:39:51;01:39:56;"Todd from regional management's coming down on Wednesday,"
01:39:56;01:39:59;"and Evan is very stressed out."
01:39:59;01:40:01;"Working at Office Depot is fun,"
01:40:01;01:40:05;"but not as fun as what I believe I could accomplish."
01:40:05;01:40:08;"I mean, I guess musicals always have a song like that,"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"but that's not even from me."
01:40:10;01:40:14;"It's like a tone of a song, but you know what does it well?"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"I mean, it's always my favorite musical, ""West Side Story,"""
01:40:16;01:40:18;"I think is actually great, because in that one,"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"the version of that song is like cool."
01:40:20;01:40:24;"It's like, it's called ""Something's Coming."""
01:40:24;01:40:26;"I don't know."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"Is that the one?"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"[singing]"
01:40:30;01:40:34;"It's like Tony, who's kind of like, well, he and Maria are the two people"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"who both have a feeling that something's going to happen different."
01:40:37;01:40:40;"He's like, I don't know what it is, but something's--"
01:40:40;01:40:42;"It's like a slightly cooler version."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"I don't actually remember if Hamilton had a song like that."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"It reminds me of college a little bit,"
01:40:46;01:40:49;"like meeting a girl that's a theater major."
01:40:49;01:40:55;"She's really into musicals, and I'd just be like, yeah, this is going to work."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"Really?"
01:40:56;01:40:57;"Yeah, totally."
01:40:57;01:40:58;"Man."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"I couldn't have."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"Wow, you probably missed out on a lot of great connections."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"Short term."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"Yeah, but you know what?"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"She's probably doing her podcast right now,"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"and somebody's talking about Dinosaur Junior,"
01:41:09;01:41:13;"and she's like, man, I remember I used to meet these like--"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"Crunch."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"These crunchy ass--"
01:41:15;01:41:18;"These skinny dudes that were in the '80s SST catalog."
01:41:18;01:41:22;"Just all they want to do is drink Modellos, and I'd be like--"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"Time to move on."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"I'd be like, you want to go do something cool?"
01:41:26;01:41:31;"And you'd be like, go back to my room and listen to that new GBV."
01:41:31;01:41:35;"And I'd just be like, no, thanks."
01:41:35;01:41:39;"Your taste in music is very non-musical theater."
01:41:39;01:41:40;"Right."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"I like musicals."
01:41:42;01:41:46;"I mean, my mom really liked musicals, and my sister was into musicals."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"I acted in a few."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"News to me."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"You didn't know that?"
01:41:50;01:41:51;"No."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Which ones?"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"I was too self-conscious to really go for it."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Like, would you sing?"
01:41:55;01:41:58;"Yeah, I was in this one called Into the Woods,"
01:41:58;01:42:03;"which is kind of like a funny one that's about like fairy tale characters."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"I was one of the princes, and there's"
01:42:05;01:42:10;"this kind of satirical song they sing called Agony, where the princes are--"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"they're kind of like deconstructing fairy tales,"
01:42:12;01:42:15;"so in that they kind of make the princes out to be dopes,"
01:42:15;01:42:18;"whereas like Cinderella and Snow White are actually the smart ones."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"So the princes sing this kind of goofy song called Agony,"
01:42:20;01:42:24;"where they're talking about how they can't find this woman that they saw."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"And so it goes like, (SINGING) agony, misery."
01:42:27;01:42:28;"Na, na, na, na, na, na."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"It's got little jokes."
01:42:30;01:42:33;"But then after I was in that, I was encouraged"
01:42:33;01:42:36;"by some of the teachers who were involved in musical theater,"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"said we were doing West Side Story next year."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"And I was like, yo, I have to go to West Side Story."
01:42:40;01:42:43;"And they're like, maybe you should consider auditioning for Tony,"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"the main part."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"And I really turned it over in my head."
01:42:46;01:42:51;"I was like a senior in high school, and I was like, eh, nah."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Didn't do it."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Yeah, I--"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"When did you start singing, though?"
01:42:55;01:42:56;"I mean, I was already--"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"Like, before Vampire?"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"No, I already had like bands."
01:42:58;01:43:00;"I mean, yeah, you had--"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"what was the name of that band?"
01:43:01;01:43:02;"The Sophisticuffs."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"And Total War."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"Was that what you were in?"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"Total War, Lone Run."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"My first band was called the Aquatones in seventh grade."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"So you were singing and writing."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"Yeah."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"Did you sing in projectors, dirty projectors?"
01:43:13;01:43:14;"No, maybe some backup vocals."
01:43:14;01:43:15;"Right."
01:43:15;01:43:18;"Speaking of, Projectors dropped an album this week."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"That's true."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"Shout out to Projectors, my brother."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"We're trying to get Dave on the show."
01:43:21;01:43:22;"He's going to come on next time."
01:43:22;01:43:23;"All right, next time."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"So we'll do a full two hours with Dave next time."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"That's going to be crazy."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Dave's favorite musicals."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"All right, back to--"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"all right, People Alone, not really our kind of song."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Yeah."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"One more song nominated in 2017, again from La La Land."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"This one's called City of Stars."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"I think this might win."
01:43:43;01:43:47;"In the movie, this is like a recurring musical motif."
01:43:47;01:43:48;"Da da da da."
01:43:48;01:43:51;"[MUSIC - DAVE AND THE AQUATONS, ""CITY OF STARS""]"
01:43:51;01:43:54;"City of stars."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"It's so Chet Baker, right?"
01:43:56;01:44:01;"Yeah, well, the main character also is a guy who loves old jazz."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"Yeah."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"City of stars."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"There's so much that I can't--"
01:44:06;01:44:09;"I had trouble connecting with that character for that reason."
01:44:09;01:44:10;"I was like, really, dude?"
01:44:10;01:44:13;"It's unclear if you're supposed to like him or not."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you."
01:44:16;01:44:19;"Yeah, well, that's part of the problem with the movie, maybe."
01:44:19;01:44:25;"That now our dreams, they finally come true."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"I think all the music is pretty good in La La Land."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"I don't mind this."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"These are very memorable melodies."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"And I like that little--"
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Who wrote all this stuff?"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"--cool jazz."
01:44:34;01:44:37;"Justin Hurwitz wrote all the music."
01:44:37;01:44:42;"And the lyrics are by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul."
01:44:42;01:44:44;"I mean, these are nice melodies."
01:44:44;01:44:46;"I don't know."
01:44:46;01:44:50;"I was just looking for something in La La Land that wasn't there."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"People did not like that movie."
01:44:52;01:44:53;"A lot of people did like it."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"A lot of people liked it, but a lot of people in--"
01:44:55;01:44:56;"Wait, do you agree with me that--"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"--our circles were not fans."
01:44:59;01:45:02;"Yeah, everybody I know wants Moonlight to win."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"You too?"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Sure."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"I would have loved to have seen 20th Century Women nominated."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"Oh, yeah, great film."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"That was probably my pick, but it didn't even get nominated."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Damn."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"And that's fine."
01:45:15;01:45:18;"I'm not going to pin my identity to that."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"I'm going to move on."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"I'll break a sweat over it."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"I'm a 20th Century Women kind of guy."
01:45:26;01:45:27;"Simple as that."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"What were you going to ask me, though?"
01:45:28;01:45:29;"Do I agree with you?"
01:45:29;01:45:32;"Oh, that Moonlight is a better film."
01:45:32;01:45:33;"Yeah, I mean, I couldn't finish La La Land."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"I was watching a screener with my mom."
01:45:35;01:45:39;"And we were both like halfway through, like, eh, we're good."
01:45:39;01:45:44;"(SINGING) City of stars, are you shining in me?"
01:45:44;01:45:47;"My mom was like, eh."
01:45:47;01:45:48;"I thought that was hilarious."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"Like you thought your mom was like the target audience?"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"Yeah, I thought my mom would just eat it up."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"I wonder if my parents liked La La Land."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"I don't know if they've seen it."
01:45:55;01:45:58;"I talked to my parents today, and they said they don't like Young Pope."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"That really hurt me."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"I'm only a few episodes in."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Oh, really?"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"I thought you were like a huge fan."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"I'm in, but then I just lost the thread."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Man."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"I'll get back in."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"You're a fake Young Pope fan."
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Man, nobody likes Young Pope but me."
01:46:10;01:46:11;"I'm like four episodes in."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"Psh."
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Nobody likes Young Pope but me."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Are you caught up?"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"Man, I watched the whole thing."
01:46:16;01:46:17;"Is it over?"
01:46:17;01:46:18;"Yeah, man, 10 episodes."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"Ugh!"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Wow."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"[burps]"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"[laughs]"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Anyway, I think--"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"We're deep in."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"We're like late episode here."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"I wonder what's going to win."
01:46:28;01:46:32;"I think City of Stars, probably because it's the song that seems the most connected to"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"the movie it's from."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Yeah, I bet that'll win."
01:46:34;01:46:36;"If Can't Stop the Feeling wins--"
01:46:36;01:46:37;"That's going to be brutal."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"That's going to be lame."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"I'll give Lin-Manuel props."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"That song is pretty good, too."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"For like, you know, it's like a musical song."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"And I haven't seen Moana, and I assume it probably--"
01:46:46;01:46:50;"As a guy who writes musicals, I don't think Lin-Manuel is going to write some just like"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"random Can't Stop the Feeling type song."
01:46:52;01:46:55;"You know, he's going to write something that has to do with the plot and the characters."
01:46:55;01:46:56;"Yeah."
01:46:56;01:46:57;"Are we done?"
01:46:57;01:46:58;"Yeah, that's all of them, man."
01:46:58;01:46:59;"Oh, wow."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"So first of all--"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"That was underwhelming."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"When we go back to 1980--"
01:47:02;01:47:03;"Well, 1981 had some bangers."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"Yeah."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Probably a stronger batch all in all."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"1981, which one of those songs do you think won?"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"We had Fame from Fame."
01:47:10;01:47:11;"We had 9to5 from 9to5."
01:47:11;01:47:14;"We had On the Road Again from Honeysuckle Rose."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"We had Out Here on My Own from Fame."
01:47:16;01:47:18;"And we had People Alone from the competition."
01:47:18;01:47:22;"Well, if I was going to choose, it would be On the Road Again."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"Um, what one?"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"I would say--"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"That's a pretty stacked year."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"--Fame won."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"Yeah, you're right."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Fame won."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"Fame!"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"I'm going to live forever."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"But also, just to look at 1981."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"We're kind of like music nerds."
01:47:39;01:47:44;"But at the end of the day, On the Road Again, 9to5, and Fame"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"are all kind of like standard songs."
01:47:46;01:47:47;"They're classics."
01:47:47;01:47:48;"You might still hear those songs at CVS."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"Totally."
01:47:49;01:47:51;"People still listen to those songs."
01:47:51;01:47:54;"I would love to hear On the Road Again at CVS."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"On the Road Again."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"Hey, can you stop by and get some NyQuil?"
01:47:57;01:47:58;"Make me on the road again."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"I have a cold."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"Pop in."
01:48:01;01:48:04;"Buying deodorant and--"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"Toothpaste."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"--NyQuil for my girlfriend."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"I can't wait to be at CVS again."
01:48:09;01:48:10;"That should be a commercial."
01:48:10;01:48:13;"Maybe I'll pick up this Snickers bar."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"Need it on the way home."
01:48:15;01:48:19;"So anyway, my point is that we have three classic--"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"maybe four classic songs from the 1981 batch."
01:48:22;01:48:27;"In 26 years--"
01:48:27;01:48:28;"36."
01:48:28;01:48:29;"30-- oh my god."
01:48:29;01:48:33;"In 36 years, will we still be talking about any of these--"
01:48:33;01:48:38;"I guess Can't Stop the Feeling is a hit song."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"Yeah, that's an open question."
01:48:40;01:48:41;"I mean--"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"Are you rooting for any of these songs, man?"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"No."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"I guess even though I didn't love Hamilton,"
01:48:46;01:48:49;"I can't be mad at Lin-Manuel Miranda."
01:48:49;01:48:54;"He does kind of seem like a good dude."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"Grew up in New York City."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"I wouldn't be mad if he won an Oscar."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"Sure."
01:49:00;01:49:03;"And then he'll probably get an EGOT eventually."
01:49:03;01:49:04;"Wait, what's that?"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"Really, you never heard that phrase?"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"It's when you win an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony."
01:49:08;01:49:11;"Oh, so Sheermag is going to get that."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Yeah, once you join the Academy."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"I'm pushing to--"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"I would be happy if Lin-Manuel Miranda--"
01:49:16;01:49:20;"I have to direct a movie and then hire Sheermag to do the music."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Right."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"So then they could get an Oscar nomination for their music."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"Or maybe just make a documentary."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"About-- yeah, about Sheermag."
01:52:42;01:52:47;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat 1."
01:56:08;01:56:12;"Well, Jake, that was quite a show."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Yep."
01:56:13;01:56:19;"Once again, we have successfully passed two hours on a Sunday"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"without grappling with--"
01:56:21;01:56:23;"Blue-bye."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"We didn't even say his name."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"Don't even just-- don't even get into it."
01:56:25;01:56:26;"All right, all right."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"We won't even say his name."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"Well, they know his name."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Anyway, we have been--"
01:56:32;01:56:36;"You keep your name."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"You keep me a name."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Thanks to our friends from Play Network"
01:56:40;01:56:45;"for calling in and educating us on the musical side"
01:56:45;01:56:48;"of the American retail landscape, or the global retail landscape."
01:56:48;01:56:49;"I don't want to sell them short."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"Thanks to the Chainsmokers and Coldplay,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"who finally won over Jake."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Thanks to Blind Melon."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"Thank you to Blind Melon."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Much disrespect--"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"[imitates air horn]"
01:57:00;01:57:02;"You know, on this show, we're generally nice to everybody."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"So it's kind of--"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"I really actually appreciate that Carlos Santana is now"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"an official enemy of the show."
01:57:09;01:57:13;"Well, I just want him to apologize one more time"
01:57:13;01:57:16;"and just also admit that as somebody"
01:57:16;01:57:20;"who relied on the vocal talent of Rob Thomas for his greatest"
01:57:20;01:57:24;"hit, he's in no position to denigrate"
01:57:24;01:57:26;"the singing talents of Beyonce."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"That's not his greatest hit, but okay."
01:57:28;01:57:31;"It's his biggest hit."
01:57:31;01:57:34;"All right, dedicated to Jake on the way out."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"No, no, no, we're not listening to Smooth."
01:57:36;01:57:37;"Okay, we're not going to listen to Smooth?"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"We're going to listen to this beautiful instrumental"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"off of the Abraxas album."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"Nice, a real crowd pleaser."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"No, it's like his best song."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"Here's a rando instrumental from--"
01:57:46;01:57:48;"Off Abraxas from the early '70s."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"It's really good."
01:57:49;01:57:50;"Here's Santana."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"I'll see you in two weeks, guys."
01:58:02;01:58:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:58:06;01:58:09;"Beats 1."
