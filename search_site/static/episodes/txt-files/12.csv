00:00;00:11;"Time Crisis, Episode 12. 2015 draws to a close as the wicked hand of time grasps another"
00:11;00:18;"year away from us. Today we'll look back on that year. I'm joined by painter and poet"
00:18;00:23;"Jake Longstreth, the youngest of the Heim girls, Alana ""Baby"" Heim. My sister Emma stops"
00:23;00:38;"by to discuss some family matters. Plus, my favorite comedian and poet Gerard Carmichael returns to the stage. This is Time Crisis with Andrew K. Nick. B-B-B-B-Beasts 1."
00:38;00:51;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war of love, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:51;01:10;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:34;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying. Leave a lonely man, staring at the ceiling. Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:34;01:51;"One of us is lonely, one of us is lonely. Waiting for a call. Sorry for ourselves, we used to be this small."
01:51;02:10;"Some mother's son lies in the field. Someone has killed some mother's son today. Head burned up by some soldier's gun."
02:10;02:28;"While all the mothers stand and wait. Some mother's son ain't coming home today. Some mother's son ain't got no grave."
02:28;02:46;"Two soldiers fighting in a trench. One soldier glances up to see the sun. And dreams of games he played when he was young."
02:46;03:06;"And then his friend calls out his name. It stops his dreams and as he turns his head. A second later he is dead."
03:06;03:24;"Some mother's son lies in the field. Black hole they put his picture in the frame. But all dead soldiers look the same."
03:24;03:44;"While all the parents stand and wait. To meet their children coming home from school. Some mother's son is lying there."
03:44;04:08;"Somewhere someone is crying. Someone is trying to be so brave. But still the world keeps turning. No more children are going away."
04:08;04:26;"Some mother's son lies in the field. But in his mother's eyes he looks the same. As on the day he went away."
04:26;04:48;"They put his picture on the wall. And when the flowers in the picture frame. Some mother's memory remains."
04:58;05:06;"That was the kinks with some mother's son. A song about the senseless violence of war. Very sad. That song has always moved me a lot."
05:06;05:09;"I think dad played that song for me for the first time when I was a kid."
05:09;05:12;"Oh, I don't think I got to hear it."
05:12;05:19;"I guess that was just a father-son bonding moment. That voice you're hearing is my sister Emma. Welcome to Time Crisis."
05:19;05:20;"Thank you for having me."
05:20;05:23;"As always, we got Jake Longstreth in the building. How are you, Jake?"
05:23;05:32;"Good, man. So did your dad play the full album or was it the specific song? Was he like, Ezra, check out this song. This is about war and death."
05:32;05:38;"Well, okay, I have a few memories about it. I don't know if he played the whole album. But I always had this idea. Maybe one day I'll do a whole episode about it."
05:38;05:42;"Do you remember when mom and dad made the family therapy mixtape?"
05:42;05:43;"No."
05:43;05:49;"Okay, so for context for the listeners, my mom is a family therapist."
05:49;05:57;"And our dad is a set dresser on movies, making sure everything looks right on the films. Also a big music buff."
05:57;06:12;"And so sometime in the 90s, mom had to go to like a family therapy conference. And somehow this idea got cooked up that she should make a mixtape of pop songs about the family experience."
06:12;06:19;"And dad like helped her with it a lot. It's like a good memory of like mom and dad collaborating on something. You were probably very little."
06:19;06:20;"That sounds awesome."
06:20;06:23;"Nine or 10. So mom and dad made an album or not an album."
06:23;06:25;"But they un-er-cassette."
06:25;06:34;"Yeah, it was like they were like recording off records. And I vividly remember this song, Some Mother's Son, being on it about like the pain of losing a child."
06:34;06:39;"Other songs I remember on it, some of which we played on Time Crisis are D-I-V-O-R-C-E."
06:39;06:40;"Oh, yeah."
06:40;06:43;"The Ramone song, We're a Happy Family. You remember the chorus?"
06:43;06:47;"We're a happy family, we're a happy family, we're a happy family, me, mom and daddy."
06:47;06:54;"Those are the only ones I remember. Next time I'm in New Jersey, I'll look for it. But anyway, that's how I came to know that song."
06:54;07:06;"Do you know that song, Six White Horses? I know the version by Waylon Jennings. Another great like father lamenting his son song. His son goes off to war."
07:06;07:07;"And dies?"
07:07;07:11;"Well, no, he's like, he doesn't know. He's just like, the son's out there at war."
07:11;07:12;"And just waiting to find out?"
07:12;07:16;"And he's just like, this war can go to hell. I want my son back. It's a beautiful song."
07:16;07:18;"Well, let's listen to it. What's it called?"
07:18;07:21;"Six White Horses by Waylon Jennings."
07:21;07:40;"Come here and look through the window, Marie. Open up the shutters and tell me what you see."
07:40;07:57;"Was that his knock that I heard at the door? Or is it six white horses coming down the road?"
07:57;08:09;"Come here and touch me and say that it's all right. You know that to my eyes, the days are as the nights."
08:09;08:23;"Read again the letter that tells me where he's gone. To hell with the fighting, I want my son home."
08:23;08:35;"I taught him to fish and I taught him to be strong. Taught him that killing any man was wrong."
08:35;08:55;"But tomorrow in battle I'd run to where he stood. If the help of a blind man would do any good."
08:55;09:07;"Last night I went to his room for a while. I touched all the things that he used as a child."
09:07;09:22;"I rocked the cradles where he used to lay. I found his ten soldiers and threw them away."
09:22;09:33;"Come here and look through the window, Marie. Open up the shutters and tell me what you see."
09:33;09:53;"Was that his knock that I heard at the door? Or is it six white horses coming up the road?"
09:53;10:03;"That was Waylon Jennings with Six White Horses. That's Jake's pick for depressing songs about war and the loss of children."
10:03;10:11;"Fathers and sons. Oh God, that stuff really gets me. I remember when I was in college, freshman year at Columbia, you got to read the Iliad."
10:11;10:20;"And there's a whole section in it about Achilles. Achilles' mother gets one of the gods to make him a shield."
10:20;10:26;"I remember the professor, who was this really cool old British guy, he was a classicist."
10:26;10:31;"So he studied Greek and stuff. I remember he really got emotional talking about it."
10:31;10:39;"I still don't know if he was so moved by it or if he had some experience with this, having a child who served in the military or something."
10:39;10:44;"But he's just describing the mother giving this special shield to protect her son Achilles."
10:44;10:48;"She couldn't protect him. Well, yeah, because as everybody knows, Achilles died."
10:48;10:52;"Yeah, they got him in the hill. Achilles' last stand. Achilles' last stand, Led Zeppelin."
10:52;10:55;"Wait, so he was emotional in class? Yeah, I remember he started crying."
10:55;11:03;"He was describing, maybe it was like the beauty of Homer's verse. Teaching it for the 80th time, still moved."
11:03;11:09;"That's very impressive. You've got to give it up, because I was a teacher for one year, and I was pretty burned out by the end of that year,"
11:09;11:14;"let alone to be like old British guys teaching the Iliad to the 80th bunch of knuckleheads."
11:14;11:19;"And you can still find something powerful in it. Wow. I want to be like that."
11:19;11:24;"You got to get a PhD in the classics. Step one. Yeah."
11:24;11:30;"No, I mean, good for him. Honestly, because sometimes you're in class and people are teaching you this old garbage,"
11:30;11:33;"and you're like, ""You don't want to teach me this."" Yeah."
11:33;11:37;"You know when you have a teacher who's teaching you Shakespeare, and you can tell they're not even that into it?"
11:37;11:39;"Or they don't even get it. Right, right."
11:39;11:47;"And you're just like in class having these brutal discussions about nobody understands the weird words and the old English,"
11:47;11:50;"and you're just trying to discuss it, and it's so painful."
11:50;11:58;"I remember I had a high school history teacher freshman year named Mr. Elges, and it was his last year teaching."
11:58;12:01;"He was probably in his 60s, and this was world history."
12:01;12:03;"And he was an amazing teacher."
12:03;12:11;"And somehow 40 years in was able to inspire our imaginations with talking about ancient Rome, ancient Egypt."
12:11;12:17;"He had this childlike wonder, just talking about the pyramids,"
12:17;12:20;"and just getting us so pumped up about thinking about people trying to build the pyramids."
12:20;12:23;"I'm like, ""How did they do it?"" Right."
12:23;12:25;"He was amazing. It's rare."
12:25;12:30;"And then my American history teacher was just reading out of the textbook and had no vibe."
12:30;12:33;"Cool story. No, no, no. I mean, it's important."
12:33;12:35;"Are there any songs about teachers?"
12:35;12:38;"There's got to be. Hot Teacher. Hot for Teacher."
12:38;12:40;"Terrible. I don't want to listen to Hot for Teacher."
12:40;12:41;"No, I don't want to either."
12:41;12:44;"Okay, let's listen to ""Teach Me How to Dougie."""
12:44;12:48;"On a serious note, this is going out to all the teachers out there in America."
12:48;12:51;"You're doing God's work, educating the next generation."
12:51;12:55;"Those of you who can find it in your heart to be passionate about the subject matter,"
12:55;12:58;"well, you're very special. So here's ""Teach Me How to Dougie."""
16:23;16:27;"That was Cali Swag District with ""Teach Me How to Dougie."""
16:27;16:29;"That one is going out to all the teachers out there."
16:29;16:32;"And you know what? Let's throw in the students. Why not?"
16:32;16:34;"All the teachers and all the students."
16:34;16:38;"So this is the last regular Time Crisis of 2015."
16:38;16:40;"We are going to do a Christmas special."
16:40;16:42;"Jake, I hope you can come through and do the Christmas special with me."
16:42;16:44;"Tell me about it. What's the plan?"
16:44;16:48;"I like the idea. Just two bros playing Christmas music and making a couple phone calls."
16:48;16:49;"That's my concept."
16:49;16:50;"Great."
16:50;16:52;"We'll discuss it more today."
16:52;16:53;"Off mic."
16:54;16:57;"So we have a Christmas special coming up, but this is the last regular show."
16:57;16:59;"So I think it's a good time to look back at 2015."
16:59;17:04;"Emma, I asked you before the show to pick your top three songs of 2015."
17:04;17:06;"You want to lay them on us? What's number one for you?"
17:06;17:09;"I think number one is ""4-5 Seconds."""
17:09;17:11;"""4-5 Seconds"" by Rihanna?"
17:11;17:14;"Rihanna, Kanye, Paul McCartney."
17:14;17:17;"You know who wrote the bridge of ""4-5 Seconds""?"
17:17;17:19;"I do. Dave."
17:19;17:22;"That's right. Dave Longstreth, who is the brother of Jake."
17:22;17:23;"Amazing."
17:23;17:26;"Amazing. So this song--I don't know who else is credited as a songwriter on it,"
17:26;17:30;"but this song is not just a collaboration between Rihanna, Kanye, and Sir Paul,"
17:30;17:32;"but also Dave Longstreth."
17:32;17:34;"So let's--you know what? Everybody knows this song,"
17:34;17:38;"so let's just skip ahead and listen to the bridge."
17:38;17:42;"This is the bridge of ""4-5 Seconds"" going out to my man, Dave."
17:42;17:46;"And I know that you're up tonight"
17:46;17:52;"Thinking how could I be so selfish?"
17:52;17:56;"But you call 'bout a thousand times"
17:56;18:01;"Wondering where I've been"
18:01;18:05;"Now I know that you're up tonight"
18:05;18:11;"Thinking how could I be so reckless?"
18:11;18:14;"But I just can't apologize"
18:14;18:20;"I hope you can understand"
18:20;18:23;"Can you hear that Dirty Projectors vibe in it?"
18:23;18:26;"And I--actually, I don't know if I can do a good impression of Dave."
18:26;18:28;"And I know that you're home tonight"
18:28;18:32;"Thinking how could I be so selfish?"
18:32;18:34;"But I just can't apologize"
18:34;18:37;"Wondering where I've been"
18:37;18:38;"Was that good?"
18:38;18:39;"Yeah, that was great."
18:39;18:43;"And also that vocal chord that they hit there is so Projectors."
18:43;18:47;"You can picture Dave, Amber."
18:47;18:49;"Congratulations to Dave."
18:49;18:50;"Yeah, good job, Dave."
18:50;18:52;"For kind of sneaking into Emma's top three."
18:52;18:53;"What else you got?"
18:53;18:57;"Well, number two, probably not the most creative choice,"
18:57;18:59;"but ""Hotline Bling"" by Drake."
18:59;19:00;"Tight."
19:00;19:03;"You used to call me on my cell phone"
19:03;19:04;"That was beautiful."
19:04;19:05;"I don't think we even need to play it."
19:05;19:10;"Late night when you need my love"
19:10;19:12;"I'll also say for these three songs,"
19:12;19:15;"I also really like the music videos."
19:15;19:16;"Oh, okay."
19:16;19:18;"It's a total experience."
19:18;19:23;"That one has that real kind of minimal James Turrell inspired light vibe."
19:23;19:26;"Some people think that ""Hotline Bling"" is sexist."
19:26;19:29;"I can't really speak to that because I've never heard it."
19:29;19:30;"Ever?"
19:30;19:32;"How is it? I don't even know what that song is about."
19:32;19:37;"There are some lines where he's maybe a little slut shaming going on."
19:37;19:40;"The line that I think people have a problem with is he says,"
19:40;19:43;"""You started wearing less and going out more."""
19:43;19:47;"Yeah, that's one that people are upset by."
19:47;19:49;"It's nasty for someone else."
19:49;19:52;"Because the implication in the song is kind of like there's something wrong with that."
19:52;19:55;"Yeah, he needs to accept that she's seeing other people."
19:55;19:58;"She's autonomous now."
19:58;19:59;"And he can't."
19:59;20:02;"What, you think all his ex-girlfriends are going to become nuns?"
20:02;20:05;"I think a lot of men don't wish that."
20:05;20:07;"Wait, so they're not even together at this point?"
20:07;20:12;"No, she used to call him on his cell phone past ten."
20:12;20:14;"Oh, yep. Copy that."
20:14;20:16;"All right, well, what's number three?"
20:16;20:19;"Number three is ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber."
20:19;20:23;"Although, I will say, I just loved Justin Bieber this year."
20:23;20:25;"So it's hard to even--"
20:25;20:26;"A lot of people are saying that."
20:26;20:28;"Yeah, unexpectedly."
20:28;20:33;"I'm not like anti-pop music at all, but I just was very into him this year."
20:33;20:35;"But why didn't you expect that you would like Justin Bieber?"
20:35;20:39;"Why did you have such a negative impression just because he drunk drove a Lamborghini in Miami?"
20:39;20:41;"Is that why?"
20:41;20:45;"Well, you know, he doesn't have the greatest rep, but did you guys ever watch ""Never Say Never,"""
20:45;20:46;"his documentary?"
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, I watched it."
20:47;20:49;"That did make me have a lot of respect for him."
20:49;20:51;"Yeah, because now you know a little bit about where he comes from."
20:51;20:56;"Where he comes from, how hard he works, how multi-talented he is."
20:56;20:58;"You know what I really related to in that video?"
20:58;20:59;"What?"
20:59;21:02;"The anxiety of being a vocalist on the road."
21:02;21:04;"Because he was a really young kid in this."
21:04;21:05;"Yeah?"
21:05;21:06;"He just wants to have fun."
21:06;21:10;"He just wants to play Nintendo Wii, Xbox, PS4 with his friends."
21:10;21:15;"And he's constantly worrying about losing his voice."
21:15;21:19;"And he has these vocal coaches being like, ""Justin, you can't say a word today."""
21:19;21:23;"And he's like a little kid basically playing to full arenas."
21:23;21:24;"So that's a rough one."
21:24;21:26;"But here's a little bit of ""Sorry"" by Justin."
21:26;21:29;"[MUSIC - JUSTIN, ""SORRY""]"
21:29;21:32;"Sorry, yeah."
21:32;21:34;"Oh, oh, oh."
21:34;21:36;"Sorry, yeah."
21:36;21:38;"Oh, oh, oh."
21:38;21:41;"Sorry, yeah."
21:41;21:43;"I know that I let you down."
21:43;21:46;"It's too late to say I'm sorry now."
21:46;21:50;"Oh, oh, oh."
21:50;21:55;"I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to."
21:55;22:00;"But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two."
22:00;22:02;"I go, I go, and then you go, you go."
22:02;22:04;"I didn't spill the truth."
22:04;22:09;"Can we both say the words and forget this?"
22:09;22:10;"Yeah."
22:10;22:14;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
22:14;22:18;"Because I'm missing more than just your body."
22:18;22:20;"Oh, oh, oh."
22:20;22:23;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
22:23;22:26;"Yeah, I know that I let you down."
22:26;22:29;"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
22:29;22:32;"I'm not just trying to get you back on my knees."
22:32;22:33;"No, no."
22:33;22:37;"Because I'm missing more than just your body."
22:37;22:39;"Your body."
22:39;22:42;"Is it too late now to say sorry?"
22:42;22:45;"Yeah, I know that I let you down."
22:45;22:48;"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
22:48;22:50;"Oh, oh, oh."
22:50;22:52;"Sorry."
22:52;22:55;"Yeah."
22:55;22:56;"Sorry."
22:56;23:00;"Oh, oh, oh."
23:00;23:02;"Sorry."
23:02;23:05;"Yeah, I know that I let you down."
23:05;23:08;"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
23:08;23:10;"Oh, oh, oh."
23:10;23:11;"Sorry."
23:11;23:14;"Yeah."
23:14;23:15;"Sorry."
23:15;23:19;"Oh, oh, oh."
23:19;23:21;"Sorry."
23:21;23:24;"Yeah, I know that I let you down."
23:24;23:26;"Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
23:26;23:42;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
23:42;23:44;"That was Justin Bieber with ""Sorry."""
23:44;23:48;"That was Emma's pick for one of the top songs of 2015."
23:48;23:52;"We've just been joined in the studio by Alana ""Baby"" Haim."
23:52;23:53;"What's up?"
23:53;23:55;"I feel like I'm cheating on my own show."
23:55;23:58;"Right, because you have your own show called Haim Time."
23:58;23:59;"Yes."
23:59;24:01;"And that's you and who else?"
24:01;24:04;"Me and these two weirdos that join me every day."
24:04;24:06;"That's really nice of you giving back to the community,"
24:06;24:08;"letting two randos in."
24:08;24:09;"No, it's me and my sisters."
24:09;24:12;"People know who you are, especially people, I think,"
24:12;24:13;"who know who I am know who you are."
24:13;24:15;"So you don't have to get into too much."
24:15;24:21;"One thing I do want to say is I saw Haim play to five people."
24:21;24:22;"Oh, yeah, you did."
24:22;24:24;"In New York. I'm a day one fan, almost."
24:24;24:26;"No, but you saw us play at some weird--"
24:26;24:27;"like at the Standard."
24:27;24:28;"Remember when you came to--"
24:28;24:31;"that was the really first time when you saw us at the Standard."
24:31;24:32;"In LA."
24:33;24:34;"Right."
24:34;24:35;"And we were wearing--"
24:35;24:38;"it was for some fashion thing."
24:38;24:39;"I don't really remember what it was,"
24:39;24:41;"but I remember we were in full face paint."
24:41;24:44;"This was like five or six years ago or something."
24:44;24:45;"It was a long-ass time ago."
24:45;24:46;"And I was like--"
24:46;24:47;"And I told a lot of people,"
24:47;24:49;"""These girls can be the next Kiss."""
24:49;24:50;"They keep rocking that face paint."
24:50;24:52;"Well, I remember you came--"
24:52;24:53;"I forget who you came with,"
24:53;24:54;"but they told us that you were coming,"
24:54;24:55;"and we hadn't really even met yet,"
24:55;24:58;"so I was like, ""Oh, my God, Ezra from Vampire Weekend's coming?"""
24:58;25:01;"And then I realized there were like five people there,"
25:01;25:03;"and I was like, ""He's going to think we're so lame."""
25:03;25:04;"And I think you definitely did."
25:04;25:05;"You left--"
25:05;25:07;"because we were in full face paint,"
25:07;25:11;"wearing these weird designs that we got talked into wearing."
25:11;25:13;"It was just not a good time,"
25:13;25:14;"and I was so embarrassed."
25:14;25:16;"But then we became Biffles."
25:16;25:17;"That's right."
25:17;25:18;"At some point."
25:18;25:20;"Actually, I know the point where we became Biffles."
25:20;25:21;"Yeah, what was that?"
25:21;25:22;"Rebecca Black."
25:22;25:24;"Oh, when Rebecca Black Friday came out."
25:24;25:25;"Yeah."
25:25;25:26;"We were having dinner,"
25:26;25:28;"and you were like, ""I got to go."
25:28;25:29;"I got to go somewhere."""
25:29;25:30;"And I was like,"
25:30;25:34;"""I brought up Rebecca Black for some reason Friday."""
25:34;25:36;"And you were like, ""Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
25:36;25:38;"Hold the phone."""
25:38;25:40;"And then we talked about Rebecca Black for like--"
25:40;25:42;"We got really deep into Friday."
25:42;25:45;"Like all the favorite parts that we had of the song."
25:45;25:47;"I mean, I remember when Friday hit."
25:47;25:51;"I mean, you know, that was kind of like"
25:51;25:54;"when people talk about the Beatles on Ed Sullivan."
25:54;25:56;"That's more for like our parents' generation,"
25:56;25:57;"the Beatles on Ed Sullivan,"
25:57;25:59;"or maybe for like grandma and grandpa"
25:59;26:01;"when jazz first came out."
26:01;26:03;"I think that's kind of for our generation"
26:03;26:05;"how it felt when Friday, Rebecca--"
26:05;26:07;"I remember there was a buzz in the air."
26:07;26:08;"That was a crazy time."
26:08;26:09;"I think that was also the same--"
26:09;26:10;"that was also around the same time"
26:10;26:22;"It was the first time there was a crazy hurricane in New York. It was a weird time. I'm really glad you reminded me of that. In fact, I think our listeners would even though we're trying to talk about 2015, let's take a trip back a few years to Rebecca Black Friday."
26:22;26:39;"Yeah."
26:39;27:06;"I'm waking up in the morning. Gotta be fresh. Gotta go downstairs. Gotta have my bowl. Gotta have cereal. Seeing everything. The time is going ticking on and on. Everybody's rushing. Gotta get down to the bus stop. Gotta catch my bus. I see my friends kicking in the front seat, sitting in the back seat. Gotta make my mind up. What seat can I take?"
27:06;27:32;"It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Getting down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend. Partying, partying. Partying, partying. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Looking forward to the weekend."
27:32;27:59;"Driving on the highway. Fun, fun, think about fun. You know what it is. I got this, you got this. My friend is by my right. Hey, I got this, you got this. Now you know it. Chicken in the front seat. Sitting in the back seat. Gotta make my mind up. What seat can I take?"
27:59;28:21;"It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Getting down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend. Partying, partying. Partying, partying."
28:21;28:32;"That was a little taste of Rebecca Black Friday, one of the most important songs of the internet era. And Alana just reminded me that was a song very important in the story of how we became Biffles."
28:32;28:34;"I'm not familiar with that term."
28:34;28:41;"A Biffle is a best friend for life. That's how I know it. Do you know like a different, I think that's the definition, best friend for life, Biffle."
28:41;28:42;"Very presumptuous."
28:42;28:43;"BFFL."
28:43;28:48;"Yeah, Biffle. You're like looking at me like I'm spelling something wrong. Like I feel like you're trying to."
28:48;28:51;"That's what I think it is."
28:51;28:53;"Best friend for life. Why are you throwing me like side eye?"
28:53;28:54;"No, no, no. I was just thinking about it."
28:54;28:56;"Don't throw your Biffle under the bus."
28:56;28:57;"Do you have a lot of Biffles?"
28:57;29:03;"I don't have many Biffles. I think I can count my Biffles on like one and a half hands."
29:03;29:08;"Well, you know what they say. Count no one a Biffle until you're dead."
29:08;29:12;"Is that what they say?"
29:12;29:19;"I think the real phrase, which sounds like probably is from the Iliad or something is count no man happy until he's dead."
29:19;29:23;"Because basically we're just basically saying, oh, you're happy. Oh, say I'm happy."
29:23;29:27;"Are you happy? Because you could get real sad for the next 40 years."
29:27;29:31;"I think people are just saying, you know, don't, you know, nothing is for sure until you're dead."
29:31;29:33;"So someone's your best friend for life."
29:33;29:39;"Okay. The only way you conclusively say that they're a Biffle is that you're still best friends with them as you die."
29:39;29:42;"So we'll revisit your friendship on your deathbeds."
29:42;29:45;"Yes. I hope you'll visit me at my deathbed."
29:45;29:46;"Oh my God, of course."
29:46;29:50;"Next year? Oh my God, knock on wood."
29:50;29:52;"I still gotta put out album two."
29:52;29:58;"Oh, that's right. I got three albums in stores now, so, you know, I'm not sweating it too much."
29:58;30:00;"Calm down over there. Calm down."
30:00;30:04;"Alana, when I texted you this morning asking you to come on the show,"
30:04;30:10;"I asked you if you would pick your top three songs of 2015 and everybody at home is dying to know."
30:10;30:14;"I mean, I hate, I hate year end lists."
30:14;30:16;"I tried to make it easy. I just said three songs."
30:16;30:19;"I know, three songs. I think it's just like, oh, I hate that."
30:19;30:21;"It's like there's, there were so many songs."
30:21;30:26;"Wait, but what do you hate? Just, just making, making somebody's day by putting their song on your list?"
30:26;30:33;"No, no, no. I'm all about making people's day and putting songs on Apple Music, Beats 1, what up?"
30:33;30:36;"But it's just so hard to narrow it down to three."
30:36;30:38;"So like I kind of, I think my..."
30:38;30:40;"How many songs came out this year? Twenty?"
30:40;30:45;"Oh my God. Are you for real? Fader, the Fader just put out a hundred and seven songs."
30:45;30:46;"But was that all time or was that this year?"
30:46;30:47;"This year."
30:47;30:49;"Really? That many this year?"
30:49;30:54;"I gasped. Just so you guys know, when I saw it on my Twitter feed, I gasped."
30:54;30:58;"But Fader's trying to put out maybe just a hundred and seven songs they listened to this year from all of history?"
30:58;31:03;"The line was top 107 songs of 2015."
31:03;31:06;"I don't, I couldn't, I don't even know that that many songs came out this year."
31:06;31:08;"I mean, I could think of Justin Bieber, sorry."
31:08;31:10;"Uh, Adele dropped one or two."
31:10;31:11;"Yeah."
31:11;31:12;"After that, I'm drawing a blank."
31:12;31:18;"Wait, are you, wait, wait, wait. Are you thinking like the top songs, like the songs that like made the most money?"
31:18;31:24;"So like when I think of my favorite songs of 2015, I just think of the songs that like were on repeat for 2015."
31:24;31:28;"Not like, cause the thing is like, I can go like, okay, hello, sorry, lean on."
31:28;31:31;"And like, those were probably like the top, really the top songs."
31:31;31:33;"And there you have it. Those are Alana's top three songs."
31:33;31:36;"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Even though those are amazing songs."
31:36;31:39;"No, no, no, no, obviously I want you to choose your top three songs."
31:39;31:40;"Okay, okay."
31:40;31:47;"That'd be pretty funny if I was like, hey Alana, can you like call your accountant and just come in and tell us the top three money makers?"
31:47;31:49;"I'm just saying that, okay."
31:49;31:57;"This is Alana Haim with Hip Hop Cash Kings. Coming in at number one is Drake at 57 million in 2015."
31:57;31:59;"Number two, no stranger to the list is Jay-Z."
31:59;32:01;"Okay, everybody calm down. Stop yelling at me."
32:01;32:02;"Okay, what are you..."
32:02;32:04;"I'm easing into time crisis, okay?"
32:04;32:05;"Yeah, okay, I'm sorry."
32:05;32:10;"I'm used to having two sisters like back me up on all my, all my endeavors."
32:10;32:12;"Today you got one sister and she's not even your sister."
32:12;32:13;"Hell yeah."
32:13;32:14;"Hey, what's up?"
32:14;32:15;"I'm f***ing with it."
32:15;32:16;"Okay, what are you..."
32:16;32:17;"Okay, sorry."
32:17;32:18;"Let's get..."
32:18;32:22;"This record came out this year, Art Angels Grimes."
32:22;32:25;"Such an awesome record. I'm like one of her biggest fans ever."
32:25;32:27;"And what's your favorite song off Art Angels?"
32:27;32:45;"I mean, all of them are amazing. I've got many, many favorites on this record, but I think Venus Fly is my favorite because I hope like in the future if like you can walk into a room and think of a song and it plays, I hope this song plays every time I walk into a room."
32:45;32:47;"Because it gives me confidence."
32:47;32:49;"Every superhero needs her theme music."
32:49;32:52;"It just bangs so f***ing hard."
32:53;32:57;"Oh, you're looking at me again."
32:57;33:15;"Why you looking at me now?"
33:15;33:17;"Why you looking at me again?"
33:17;33:18;"What if I pull my teeth?"
33:18;33:20;"Tuck my hair underneath my jeans?"
33:20;33:22;"Wrap my curls all around the world."
33:22;33:24;"Throw my pearls all up in the floor."
33:24;33:26;"Steal my beat like a cyber girl."
33:26;33:28;"Cause I want it all."
33:28;33:31;"Why you looking at me?"
33:31;33:33;"Why you looking at me?"
33:33;33:35;"I can't stop."
33:35;33:39;"Why you looking at me?"
33:39;33:41;"Why you looking at me?"
33:41;33:44;"Grimes, Venus Fly featuring Janelle Monae."
33:44;33:47;"So you pick one Grimes song. What's your next song?"
33:47;33:52;"My next song is Kanye."
33:52;33:54;"Cause obviously Kanye rules my life."
33:54;33:59;"I love Kanye. I've been the biggest Kanye fan since his first record."
33:59;34:02;"I always say this, I think he's like the future."
34:02;34:04;"Everything that he puts out is like future."
34:04;34:08;"You never know what he's gonna put out next and every time it's like the biggest surprise."
34:08;34:13;"And All Day is definitely, I mean we put this on, we went on tour this past year."
34:13;34:15;"This was like our warm up song to get us pumped up."
34:15;34:17;"I love this song."
34:17;34:19;"All the lyrics to this song are amazing."
34:19;34:22;"He drops them all. I love them all."
34:22;34:31;"All day, all day, all day."
34:31;34:34;"How long you need this vibe?"
34:34;34:35;"All day, all day."
34:35;34:37;"How much time you spend at the mall?"
34:37;34:39;"All day, all day."
34:39;34:41;"How many runners do you got on car?"
34:41;34:43;"All day, all day."
34:43;34:45;"How long they keep you in call?"
34:45;34:47;"All day, all day."
34:47;34:49;"Take you to get this fly?"
34:49;34:51;"All day, all day."
34:51;34:53;"Tell your P.O. how long you been high?"
34:53;34:55;"All day, all day."
34:55;34:57;"Already know I'm straight from the shop."
34:57;34:59;"All day, all day."
34:59;35:01;"Top, top, top, side."
35:01;35:02;"Great song."
35:02;35:04;"How long you spent at the mall?"
35:04;35:06;"All day."
35:06;35:09;"I sometimes spend all day at the f*** mall."
35:09;35:11;"And it's a good day."
35:11;35:14;"So when you first heard that song and that lyric came on,"
35:14;35:16;"you're just like, ""Kanye, are you reading my mind?"""
35:16;35:18;"You're speaking to my soul."
35:18;35:22;"Okay, everybody knows we're Valley Girls and we have the Fashion Square in the Valley."
35:22;35:27;"And I used to spend sometimes all day at the Fashion Square mall."
35:27;35:30;"So it really spoke to my soul, that one."
35:30;35:33;"I might spend all day at the mall, maybe on Black Friday or something,"
35:33;35:35;"trying to get stocking stuffers for my loved ones."
35:35;35:36;"Yeah."
35:36;35:37;"I could relate to that too."
35:37;35:39;"I don't know if I could do that because that's like a lot."
35:39;35:42;"Black Friday? Have you ever gone to Black Friday sales?"
35:42;35:43;"Every year, as a girl."
35:43;35:44;"I've been."
35:44;35:47;"Yeah, I went to the Willowbrook Mall in New Jersey."
35:47;35:49;"It's outrageous."
35:49;35:51;"It's like the Hunger Games."
35:51;35:52;"You see the true vibe."
35:52;35:55;"I never saw anything get too wild, but it was crowded."
35:55;35:59;"Obviously, you've never been to Forever 21 on Black Friday."
35:59;36:01;"No, that's a ladies' store."
36:01;36:02;"Obviously."
36:02;36:03;"No, there's men's there."
36:03;36:04;"Yeah."
36:04;36:06;"No, when I was younger, Forever 21."
36:06;36:07;"I go to Forever 21."
36:07;36:10;"I appreciate women's fashion and everybody."
36:10;36:12;"There's no such thing as men's or women's clothes."
36:12;36:13;"Wait, hold on."
36:13;36:14;"Okay, sorry."
36:14;36:17;"I wanted to drop some music stuff."
36:17;36:18;"Do you guys know?"
36:18;36:22;"So ""All Day,"" we know, starts with this very Kanye-sounding melody."
36:22;36:30;"[imitates Kanye]"
36:30;36:31;"All day."
36:31;36:33;"And we know that Paul McCartney's featured on the song, right?"
36:33;36:34;"Yeah."
36:34;36:37;"Because he comes in at the end kind of whistling and singing."
36:37;36:39;"But did you know that that melody in the beginning,"
36:39;36:43;"Paul McCartney wrote it like in the '70s or something."
36:43;36:44;"What?"
36:44;36:45;"So he was on a talk show."
36:45;36:46;"I want to play this."
36:46;36:49;"He was on a talk show in the UK in the '80s,"
36:49;36:51;"and he was talking about how he writes songs."
36:51;36:53;"I noticed you just had two fingers here."
36:53;36:54;"You get that?"
36:54;36:56;"This is him on an '80s talk show."
36:56;36:59;"So I thought, well, I'll try and see what the chord is."
36:59;37:01;"Kind of explaining his songwriting process."
37:01;37:03;"Ooh, that's nice."
37:03;37:06;"So then I tried to--I used that as the inspiration"
37:06;37:10;"and tried to write a song that only had--used two fingers."
37:10;37:11;"So I'll play you a bit of that."
37:11;37:12;"Please."
37:12;37:15;"Note carefully, two fingers all the time."
37:15;37:17;"My hand never leaves my wrist."
37:17;37:20;"[laughter]"
37:20;37:23;"[imitates Kanye]"
37:23;37:32;"[whistles]"
37:32;37:34;"What?"
37:34;37:38;"[whistles]"
37:38;37:39;"[whistles]"
37:39;37:41;"That's Paul McCartney's kind of jazzy version."
37:41;37:42;"What?"
37:42;37:43;"I know, so he wrote that like 30 years ago,"
37:43;37:45;"and I imagine he walked in the studio,"
37:45;37:48;"and Kanye was like, ""You got any leftovers from back in the day?"""
37:48;37:51;"And he's like, ""Well, I wrote this one thing with two fingers,"
37:51;37:52;"and whoo-hoo!"""
37:52;37:54;"And then Kanye was like, ""Oh, that's kind of good."
37:54;37:56;"What if I sang it like this?"""
37:56;38:01;"[imitates Kanye]"
38:01;38:02;"All day."
38:02;38:04;"You can't not say ""all day"" after that."
38:04;38:05;"It's so good."
38:05;38:07;"It's me, Paul."
38:07;38:08;"That wasn't very good."
38:08;38:11;"That's a really awful Beatles impression."
38:11;38:13;"Oh, my God."
38:13;38:14;"No, no, no, that was totally--"
38:14;38:18;"No, I don't even get into regional British accents."
38:18;38:20;"What's your final pick for 2015?"
38:20;38:22;"Well, this pick, it was not big,"
38:22;38:23;"and I think it should have been big,"
38:23;38:26;"because I actually got my heart broken in 2015."
38:26;38:28;"It was a very sad heartbreak,"
38:28;38:30;"and one song got me through."
38:30;38:31;"Oh, yeah?"
38:31;38:33;"Yeah, one song got me through."
38:33;38:35;"And I was actually lucky enough to hear the song"
38:35;38:36;"before it came out,"
38:36;38:38;"because our good friend Ariel Reksha"
38:38;38:41;"had produced the record for--"
38:41;38:43;"Oh, what are you talking about, Adele?"
38:43;38:44;"No, not for Adele."
38:44;38:46;"Do you think Adele would let anyone have their song?"
38:46;38:49;"I would be dead if I heard any Adele tracks"
38:49;38:50;"before it came out."
38:50;38:51;"Oh, I'm sorry, when you said heartbreak,"
38:51;38:52;"of course I thought of Adele."
38:52;38:53;"No, of course, I mean,"
38:53;38:55;"Adele, of course, gets you through heartbreak."
38:55;38:56;"What else did Ariel produce this year?"
38:56;38:57;"Brandon Flowers!"
38:57;38:58;"Brandon Flowers."
38:58;38:59;"Oh, Brandoss."
38:59;39:02;"One of my favorites, Between Me and You."
39:02;39:05;"This song got me through my heartbreak of 2015."
39:05;39:08;"Brandon Flowers, Between Me and You."
39:08;39:12;"Yes, it's on the new record, The Desired Effect."
39:12;39:14;"Produced by our mutual friend, Ariel."
39:14;39:16;"Ariel, disrespect, Shed."
39:16;39:18;"Disrespect, Shed."
39:18;39:19;"Let's check it out."
39:19;39:24;"Between me and you"
39:24;39:28;"I've been thinking about"
39:28;39:33;"the future and"
39:33;39:36;"Between me and you"
39:36;39:40;"I think I'm losing it now"
39:40;39:48;"Between me and you"
39:48;39:52;"I've been worried about"
39:52;39:57;"the future and"
39:57;40:00;"Between me and you"
40:00;40:04;"I think I'm losing it now"
40:04;40:12;"And all my life"
40:12;40:15;"I've been told"
40:15;40:18;"Follow your dream"
40:18;40:21;"But the trail went cold"
40:21;40:24;"And the heart don't lie"
40:24;40:27;"And that's a good luck charm"
40:27;40:30;"But I'm watching it tear up"
40:30;40:32;"Of my arms"
40:32;40:36;"There's a power in letting go"
40:36;40:37;"Yeah"
40:37;40:41;"I guess I didn't wanna let you know"
40:41;40:43;"That's hot as f***"
40:43;40:45;"Wait, what did you say?"
40:45;40:47;"There's a power in letting go."
40:47;40:49;"Yeah, I guess I didn't wanna let you know."
40:49;40:52;"Yes, and then it goes in, I mean, it's more,"
40:52;40:53;"there's a power in letting go."
40:53;40:56;"I thought that that was a very profound lyric for me."
40:56;40:59;"I would probably get that tattooed if I could get tattoos."
40:59;41:02;"It's the opposite of the power of love, Huey Lewis."
41:02;41:03;"Yeah."
41:03;41:04;"The power of letting go."
41:04;41:06;"Well, first of all, I wanna say it's brave to pick"
41:06;41:08;"an emotional song."
41:08;41:09;"Yeah."
41:09;41:11;"Because I think we probably all had this experience,"
41:11;41:13;"you know, we're all sensitive people,"
41:13;41:14;"as Marvin Gaye said,"
41:14;41:16;"and sometimes we'll spend a late night"
41:16;41:18;"with a quiet record,"
41:18;41:20;"really kind of get into the lyrics,"
41:20;41:22;"really like spend some time with it,"
41:22;41:24;"and then in the cold light of day,"
41:24;41:26;"you're like, ""Wow, I feel so like connected"
41:26;41:28;"to that like beautiful quiet song,"
41:28;41:30;"that song about heartbreak."""
41:30;41:32;"And then maybe you're talking music with your friends,"
41:32;41:34;"and you're like, ""Hey, you wanna know what's a great song?"
41:34;41:36;"It's this one that I cried to last night."""
41:36;41:38;"And then you play it, and you just like,"
41:38;41:41;"it's horrible watching other people listen to it,"
41:41;41:43;"like everybody's talking, everybody--"
41:43;41:44;"Yes, that's how I just felt."
41:44;41:46;"That's how I just felt."
41:46;41:47;"No, no, I think--"
41:47;41:49;"This song means so much to me."
41:49;41:51;"I know, it's very hard to communicate"
41:51;41:53;"like the really beautiful kind of--"
41:53;41:55;"I guess that's like borderline if you'd call it a ballad,"
41:55;41:56;"but you know what I mean?"
41:56;41:58;"Yeah, like playing these songs that like really move you"
41:58;42:00;"when you're by yourself, like headphone songs."
42:00;42:01;"I mean, it's definitely a--"
42:01;42:03;"Like, I mean, I live in LA,"
42:03;42:05;"so it's like a lot of like late night driving."
42:05;42:06;"But by yourself."
42:06;42:08;"Yeah, by myself,"
42:08;42:10;"like hitting the steering wheel,"
42:10;42:11;"like screaming,"
42:11;42:13;"there's a power in letting go."
42:13;42:15;"I know, but like when Taylor Swift hands you the aux cord,"
42:15;42:17;"you're not gonna play that song."
42:17;42:19;"You're not gonna play that song for sure."
42:19;42:20;"Maybe it was just the two of you."
42:20;42:21;"No, I think--"
42:21;42:23;"The thing is, I think it's such a pretty song."
42:23;42:25;"You get to vibes with friends where--"
42:25;42:27;"It's not all Venus Fly all the time, believe me."
42:27;42:28;"No, no, I know, I know, but like--"
42:28;42:31;"You could go like get with your friends and be like--"
42:31;42:32;"Let's just vibe out for a second."
42:32;42:33;"There's a power in letting go."
42:34;42:37;"I just feel like in the car, it's so noisy."
42:37;42:39;"Well, it depends, like at what point of your night,"
42:39;42:40;"like I probably wouldn't play this"
42:40;42:41;"at the beginning of the night."
42:41;42:43;"I wouldn't start off my night with like,"
42:43;42:44;"""All right, let's play between me and you."""
42:44;42:46;"Like, ""Let's just get into the zone."""
42:46;42:47;"I would go with Venus Fly,"
42:47;42:50;"'cause it's like, ""Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow."""
42:50;42:51;"And then all day."
42:51;42:54;"And then at the end of the night, when it's like,"
42:54;42:55;"""Let's calm down for a second."
42:55;42:57;"""Let's just remember that we're all friends"
42:57;42:59;"""and how lucky we are."
42:59;43:01;"""I'll put on 'Between Me and You.'"""
43:01;43:03;"All right, as long as everybody's ready to listen."
43:03;43:05;"'Cause if people are talking--"
43:05;43:08;"'Cause you can talk during the party song, and it's okay."
43:08;43:09;"Yes, yeah, of course."
43:09;43:12;"You can't talk during ""Between Me and You."""
43:12;43:14;"No, 'cause it's so beautiful."
43:14;43:16;"""Hi, I'm Brandon Flowers, and well done, Ariel."
43:16;43:17;"""Disrespect, Shad."""
43:17;43:19;"Shout out, love you guys."
43:19;43:21;"I forgot this album came out in 2015."
43:21;43:22;"I thought it was more like 2014."
43:22;43:24;"No, it was a really good album."
43:24;43:27;"It's one of my faves from 2015."
43:27;43:28;"Yeah, he did a good job."
43:28;43:29;"Yeah."
43:29;43:31;"You know, I didn't really pick any of my favorite songs"
43:31;43:33;"for 2015, 'cause usually on Time Crisis,"
43:33;43:35;"I play older music."
43:35;43:36;"I feel your pain."
43:36;43:39;"I can't believe you asked all of us to choose,"
43:39;43:42;"and you didn't even take the time to think about it."
43:42;43:43;"I mean, if I really had to pick my top three,"
43:43;43:44;"I would probably call my account and ask"
43:44;43:46;"which top three made the most money."
43:46;43:48;"Oh, you know what song definitely made a lot of money?"
43:48;43:49;"What?"
43:49;43:50;"Is ""Major Lazer Lean On."""
43:50;43:51;"Oh, yeah."
43:51;43:54;"I think, wasn't that like the most downloaded song of this--"
43:54;43:55;"maybe not anymore, because of Adele."
43:55;43:57;"It was the most streamed on Spotify."
43:57;44:00;"And it was one of the most successful independently released singles"
44:00;44:01;"of all time."
44:01;44:02;"And here's what I'll say."
44:02;44:04;"You know, a lot of people with a lot of money"
44:04;44:06;"are very bad people."
44:06;44:08;"Having money doesn't make you good."
44:08;44:09;"It often makes you bad."
44:09;44:13;"But in this one instance, I will say that I'm happy"
44:13;44:17;"that an independently released single was very successful."
44:17;44:18;"Hear, hear."
44:18;44:19;"That's something to root for."
44:19;44:20;"It is."
44:20;44:21;"And I like that song."
44:21;44:22;"I'm all about that."
44:22;44:26;"So let's listen to 12 seconds of our good friend"
44:26;44:29;"Diplo's ""Major Lazer's Lean On."""
44:29;44:32;"Do you recall not long ago"
44:32;44:34;"We would walk on the sidewalk"
44:34;44:37;"Innocent, remember"
44:37;44:40;"All we did was care for each other"
44:40;44:42;"But the night was warm"
44:42;44:44;"We were bold and young"
44:44;44:47;"All around the windows"
44:47;44:49;"We would only hold on to echo"
44:49;44:52;"Block this, fire a gun"
44:52;44:54;"We need someone to lean on"
44:54;44:57;"Block this, fire a gun"
44:57;44:59;"All we need is somebody to lean on"
44:59;45:02;"Block this, fire a gun"
45:02;45:04;"We need someone to lean on"
45:04;45:08;"That was the first 12 seconds of ""Major Lazer's Lean On."""
45:08;45:13;"I want to have a big shout-out to Wes Diplo and Mo"
45:13;45:15;"and everybody else who was involved in that song."
45:15;45:17;"Alana, you're from L.A."
45:17;45:18;"Truth."
45:18;45:19;"Emma, you've lived in L.A. for a while."
45:19;45:20;"Three years."

45:22;45:23;"Yeah, four years."
45:23;45:25;"Today, for the first time, we're gonna do a segment"
45:25;45:27;"that's about new music."
45:27;45:28;"Mm, okay."
45:28;45:31;"And this is one that Jake specifically cooked up."
45:31;45:35;"Jake wanted to highlight some of the good new music"
45:35;45:37;"that's coming out of Los Angeles."
45:37;45:38;"And are all these songs from 2015?"
45:38;45:41;"Yeah, local bands, 2015."
45:41;45:42;"Oh, my God, no way. I'm down."
45:42;45:43;"I love it."
45:43;45:44;"So where should we start?"
45:44;45:46;"I mean, do you want to first say a few words"
45:46;45:49;"about the City of Angels?"
45:49;45:50;"No."
45:50;45:54;"There's been enough pontificating on L.A."
45:54;45:55;"I don't need to weigh in on that."
45:55;45:56;"There you have it."
45:56;45:58;"Simple words about the City of Angels"
45:58;46:00;"from a man who loves it."
46:00;46:01;"Okay, let's get into the music."
46:01;46:03;"What you got for us?"
46:03;46:07;"Okay, let's start with Peter J. Brandt."
46:07;46:11;"He released an album this year called ""Facades."""
46:11;46:15;"And the song we should listen to is called ""Screen Time,"""

48:08;48:10;"I think it's a little bit like--"
48:10;48:13;"it's not that didactic."
48:13;48:14;"Right."
48:14;48:18;"It's sort of just like, let's get a little less screen time."
48:18;48:19;"I like that."
48:19;48:23;"That's a good resolution for 2015 to '16."
48:23;48:24;"Yeah."
48:24;48:27;"My friend's personal trainer told me that"
48:27;48:31;"you got to get one hour of no screen time per day."
48:31;48:32;"That's it?"
48:32;48:33;"[laughter]"
48:33;48:34;"Does that include driving?"
48:34;48:36;"That's sort of a screen."
48:36;48:37;"Oh, that's interesting."
48:37;48:40;"Is that staring out your window as a screen?"
48:40;48:41;"A little bit."
48:41;48:42;"That was so poetic."
48:42;48:43;"That's true."
48:43;48:44;"Staring at your window as a screen."
48:44;48:46;"Staring through the proscenium of hard steel."
48:46;48:47;"Ooh."
48:47;48:51;"No, I think he just meant like--and honestly, it's harder than you think."
48:51;48:54;"I guess you're a painter, so you spend all day painting."
48:54;48:56;"Arguably, that's a screen."
48:56;48:58;"Not really."
48:58;49:03;"He said an hour of no screen time, and that includes canvases."
49:03;49:05;"[laughter]"
49:05;49:10;"He's like, ""What if I go to the Guggenheim?"""
49:10;49:11;"And he's like, ""Well, that depends."
49:11;49:12;"""Are you looking at sculptures?"""
49:12;49:13;"He said, ""I might look at a few paintings."
49:13;49:14;"""It doesn't count."""
49:14;49:17;"That is a 2D surface, sir."
49:17;49:18;"Nothing 2D."
49:18;49:23;"His point was a lot of these fitness guys are obsessed with the fact that"
49:23;49:27;"it's not exactly from some kind of hippy-dippy moral point of view,"
49:27;49:29;"like, ""Hey, man, live in the moment."""
49:29;49:32;"It's more like the blue light emanating from your screen"
49:32;49:35;"is messing with the chemicals in your brain"
49:35;49:38;"and causing you to have higher estrogen than you need,"
49:38;49:39;"and blah, blah, blah."
49:39;49:42;"It makes it harder to lose that belly fat."
49:42;49:44;"Put down the phone."
49:44;49:45;"Maybe there is kind of like a--"
49:45;49:47;"Who is your trainer that talks that way?"
49:47;49:49;"Okay, first of all, this is my friend's trainer."
49:49;49:51;"Oh, your friend's trainer. Okay."
49:51;49:55;"Is it really your friend's trainer, or are you afraid to say it's your trainer?"
49:55;49:56;"No, no, I promise."
49:56;50:00;"I don't have like an official--I used to kind of have a trainer in New York."
50:00;50:04;"It's funny, the last episode we talked a lot about men's fitness as well."
50:04;50:07;"I used to sometimes go work out with a dude at my gym,"
50:07;50:09;"but it was pretty casual."
50:09;50:11;"I swear, the guy I'm talking about is not my--"
50:11;50:15;"This guy is like this big--he's the guy who got Chris Pratt on fat."
50:15;50:18;"This guy has been referenced a few times on the show."
50:18;50:19;"Many times."
50:19;50:21;"You should get some free sessions."
50:21;50:23;"You're getting a lot of publicity."
50:23;50:26;"Well, I haven't said his name yet."
50:26;50:28;"I guess if you're really interested--"
50:28;50:31;"I've seen a lot of people say, and I think it's a good thing,"
50:31;50:33;"you know, you've got to have the body that you want."
50:33;50:35;"Chris Pratt got jacked, and that's great,"
50:35;50:37;"but that doesn't mean people didn't love him"
50:37;50:40;"and find him attractive and a worthwhile person when he was chubbier."
50:40;50:43;"I actually found him more attractive chubbier."
50:43;50:44;"That was my vibe."
50:44;50:45;"So, you know, there you go."
50:45;50:46;"He's more cuddly."
50:46;50:50;"That said, if he's happier having a kind of 12-pack or whatever,"
50:50;50:52;"then that's all that matters is that he's happier with it."
50:52;50:53;"But me, I don't know."
50:53;50:55;"I like him both ways. Yeah."
50:55;50:58;"So back to the L.A. music."
50:58;51:01;"Okay, let's do another song by a band"
51:01;51:03;"that's been around for a really long time called Little Wings."
51:03;51:04;"Oh, yes."
51:04;51:06;"My buddy Kyle Field, an incredible songwriter,"
51:06;51:11;"he released an album this year on Woodzist called ""Explains,"""
51:11;51:14;"and let's listen to the song called ""Light Brang."""
51:24;51:29;"Look at what that light brang, we're all tied, rolling lightning"
51:29;51:33;"Breathless, fast, thunder clap, I know it's kind of frightening"
51:33;51:37;"Look at what that light brought, run with it like a marathon"
51:37;51:42;"Sleepy, hollow, headless, and our neighbor calls me Ichabod"
51:42;51:46;"Show up on the roof at night, slide right down the chimney"
51:46;51:51;"Stuff the stockings, eat the cookies, know I'm never stingy"
51:51;51:55;"Fairness that is heightened, muscles that are tight"
51:55;52:00;"Crimson jersey bear, Brian, now the corner's bright"
52:19;52:21;"I like it, this is kind of a rap song, huh?"
52:21;52:26;"Sounds like butter, like it's like buttery, it's like feeling good."
52:26;52:28;"His songs have gotten super dense."
52:28;52:30;"There was an Ichabod Crane reference in there."
52:30;52:31;"I appreciate it."
52:31;52:33;"There's a lot of, I mean if you get deep on Kyle's lyrics,"
52:33;52:37;"he has a way of really combining some amazing imagery."
52:37;52:41;"There's a lyric in the song that's ""De Chanel up in that pantine,"
52:41;52:43;"water inside that canteen."""
52:43;52:44;"[laughter]"
52:44;52:47;"Because Zooey De Chanel did like a pantine out or something?"
52:47;52:50;"It's hilarious, but like putting that in a song, it's like what?"
52:50;52:52;"""Up in that pantine."""
52:52;52:53;"And so he lives out in Malibu?"
52:53;52:54;"Yeah."
52:54;52:57;"Yeah, I've only met him briefly, but I've always heard a lot about him from you."
52:57;53:02;"He surfs a lot, very prolific songwriter."
53:02;53:03;"Yeah, he's released a ton of albums."
53:03;53:04;"And you've played guitar with him, right?"
53:04;53:09;"Yeah, I have. I've played in his live band a few times."
53:09;53:12;"But I mean, yeah, this is his, you know, it's fun to,"
53:12;53:14;"he has like, he'll put together like pickup bands."
53:14;53:15;"Right."
53:15;53:18;"He sounds like a pretty mellow guy."
53:18;53:20;"Yeah."
53:20;53:22;"Mellow can be boring though. It's not--"
53:22;53:24;"Oh, right. No, no. I meant like--"
53:24;53:25;"Chill."
53:25;53:29;"I'm picturing this guy living in Malibu, like writing songs, surfing."
53:29;53:31;"Yeah, I don't mean boring at all. I mean like--"
53:31;53:33;"Jimmy Buffett."
53:33;53:34;"Not Buffett."
53:34;53:36;"Not Buffett."
53:36;53:38;"Just chill on the beach."
53:38;53:39;"Deep dude."
53:39;53:42;"That was ""Little Wings"" with Light Brang. What else you got?"
53:42;53:49;"LA Takedown released a new record a few weeks ago on Ribbon Music."
53:49;53:51;"And it's a 40-minute track."
53:51;53:52;"Okay."
53:52;53:54;"Oh yeah, I heard about this."
53:54;53:57;"Yeah, it's the concept of the band for this record is sort of like"
53:57;54:00;"a Michael Mann soundtrack from 1982."
54:00;54:01;"So it's a lot of--"
54:01;54:02;"Okay."
54:02;54:04;"But the band is amazing live. It's like a seven-piece."
54:04;54:08;"And they bring it. It's really good live."
54:08;54:09;"Instrumental rock."
54:09;54:10;"Okay."
54:10;54:12;"It's a 40-minute song, but we'll play a couple minutes of it."
54:12;54:13;"Let's just get a taste of it."
54:13;54:14;"Yeah, yeah."
54:14;54:15;"So you want to play a little bit of part three?"
54:15;54:16;"Yeah, yeah."
54:16;54:18;"All right. Here's LA Takedown with part three of--"
54:18;54:20;"And the whole song is called LA Takedown?"
54:20;54:22;"I believe the record's called LA Takedown."
54:22;54:24;"I love when bands have a song--"
54:24;54:25;"This is our first record."
54:25;54:26;"--with the name of the band."
54:26;54:27;"And it's one song."
54:27;54:28;"Yeah, and it's one song."
54:28;54:31;"We got to make a Vampire Weekend song."
54:31;54:35;"This one starts off kind of chill, and then the guitars drop in like a minute in."
54:38;54:44;"And so the whole piece kind of swells, kind of ebbs and flows."
54:44;54:47;"So we're kind of catching a chill part here."
54:47;54:51;"What kind of images do you see in your mind's eye when we play this?"
54:51;54:54;"Like a smoggy sunset. I mean, they really--"
54:54;54:59;"You see downtown LA like a shiny office building?"
54:59;55:06;"Maybe. I'm thinking more of just bumper-to-bumper traffic at dusk."
55:06;55:08;"That's cool."
55:14;55:18;"This guy Aaron Olson, this is his kind of project."
55:18;55:23;"And he was telling me that that concept of a 1982 Michael Mann soundtrack,"
55:23;55:26;"when he said that, I was like, ""Oh, that's so specific."""
55:26;55:29;"When I think of Michael Mann, I think of his more--"
55:29;55:34;"I think of like heat in the '90s, in the 2000s, collateral."
55:34;55:35;"Right."
55:35;55:37;"One of my favorite TC films, that's Tom Cruise."
55:37;55:39;"And great LA movies."
55:39;55:41;"Miami Vice."
55:41;55:43;"What are his '80s movies?"
55:43;55:45;"Thief."
55:45;55:52;"There's a film called Thief with James Caan from '82, '83,"
55:52;55:54;"which I think was a big inspiration for this record,"
55:54;55:58;"although I'm sort of extending my knowledge a little bit."
55:58;55:59;"I'm sort of--"
55:59;56:00;"Right."
56:00;56:02;"--bringing the gaps there a little bit."
56:23;56:26;"How would you describe this guitar tone?"
56:26;56:31;"Fuzz."
56:31;56:35;"Is it like digital fuzz?"
56:35;56:37;"I would just take it for what it is."
56:37;56:39;"I think that was a really good--that's fuzz."
56:39;56:42;"I feel that."
56:42;56:45;"Probably a classic fuzz pedal, but, yeah, they're recording on Pro Tools."
56:45;56:46;"There's different kinds of fuzz."
56:46;56:49;"Don't fuzz shame me, Alana."
56:49;56:52;"There's like '60s dirty--"
56:52;56:53;"No, this isn't like--"
56:53;56:54;"Yeah."
56:54;56:55;"--this isn't like garage rock fuzz."
56:55;57:00;"This is--I mean, this is like a fuzz pedal from the '80s."
57:00;57:01;"I don't know."
57:01;57:02;"I have no idea, dude."
57:02;57:05;"I think we should do future episodes where we just like--"
57:05;57:06;"Speculate on the pedals?"
57:06;57:11;"--just live narrate very long instrumental music."
57:11;57:13;"Some ELO instrumentals."
57:13;57:15;"Let me text Aaron and ask about the pedal rig."
57:15;57:16;"Yeah, you should."
57:16;57:17;"It's a great radio."
57:17;57:18;"Can we get Aaron on the phone?"
57:18;57:19;"Probably."
57:19;57:22;"Hey, man, what you working with?"
57:22;57:23;"You know what's cool about this?"
57:23;57:28;"It's like Tame Impala, but for like with '80s--it's like an L.A. Tame Impala."
57:28;57:29;"I could see that."
57:29;57:30;"That's a good record."
57:30;57:32;"That was a really good 2015 record."
57:32;57:34;"Remember we saw them live together?"
57:34;57:35;"We did."
57:35;57:37;"At Terminal 5 in New York."
57:37;57:38;"Yes."
57:38;57:39;"Oh, yeah, we did."
57:39;57:40;"I forgot about that."
57:40;57:41;"Yeah, we did."
57:41;57:43;"There was an epic journey to that concert."
57:43;57:44;"We got a lot of steps in that day."
57:44;57:45;"Oh, right, right."
57:45;57:46;"Yeah, I remember that."
57:46;57:48;"That was definitely one of my top shows of 2015."
57:48;57:49;"Yeah."
57:49;57:51;"I haven't seen very many shows in 2015, though."
57:51;57:52;"You know what, Jake?"
57:52;57:55;"I got to say, you put together a killer set--"
57:55;57:56;"You're going to cut me off."
57:56;57:57;"--of L.A. music."
57:57;58:00;"I literally liked every song you played, and that's why--"
58:00;58:01;"That's a rarity."
58:01;58:06;"--I will definitely not let you play--no, okay."
58:06;58:09;"Nicholas Krugovich, one more L.A. song."
58:09;58:12;"Yeah, well, it's called ""PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:12;58:14;"""Driving on PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:14;58:15;"Whoa, very L.A."
58:15;58:16;"Okay."
58:16;58:17;"It's a good one."
58:17;58:19;"""Driving on PCH on Oscar Night."""
58:19;58:20;"It's a good one."
58:20;58:21;"All right, let's check it out."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"I like it."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"Nicholas Krugovich."
01:00:05;01:00:10;"That is K-R-G-O-V-I-C-H, Nicholas Krugovich."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"Part-time L.A. guy, part-time Vancouver, Canada."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Oh, that's Vancouver, I see."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"A big Time Crisis fan."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Krugovich?"
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"Oh, amazing."
01:00:20;01:00:24;"Well, he's got a lot of fans in this room after, I think, most of us are hearing that for the first time."
01:00:24;01:00:29;"You should put together--I want to see a Nuggets-type compilation put together by Jake."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"I'd love to."
01:00:30;01:00:31;"For L.A. 2015 music."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Love to."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"At the very least, a playlist."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"I think this is a good start here."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"Very vibey."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"""Along the PCH on Oscar Night."""
01:00:39;01:00:45;"Out here in Los Angeles, the mood really shifts during awards season."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"True."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"You really can't escape that energy in the air."
01:00:49;01:00:57;"You know, one funny thing--I won't say who--but a friend who moved here from New York,"
01:00:57;01:01:04;"who is a very big L.A. proponent, once said--and he's always kind of saying how L.A.--he's so glad he moved out of New York and he loves L.A.--"
01:01:04;01:01:11;"and he's always super positive, and one time he was like, ""Man, I was watching the Golden Globes over at somebody's house."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"I did not like it."""
01:01:13;01:01:15;"And I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
01:01:15;01:01:21;"He's like, ""You know, man, I love L.A., but the one time I've had Buyers Remorse--award season."""
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And I was like, ""What are you talking about?"""
01:01:24;01:01:28;"This person--he bought a house or whatever--I think he kind of felt like,"
01:01:28;01:01:37;"""Look, when you're out in New York, Boston, Chicago, Asheville, North Carolina, wherever--"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"All the big places."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"All the big places. I love Asheville."
01:01:41;01:01:45;"When you watch the Oscars, it's like this goofy, distant dream world."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"Okay."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"Or especially the Golden Globes."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"Yeah, okay."
01:01:49;01:01:55;"But if you're in L.A. and you're like showbiz or showbiz adjacent, as all of us are,"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"and somebody invites you over to watch the Golden Globes,"
01:01:57;01:02:04;"it's not like, you know, like throw popcorn at the screen with your kooky aunt."
01:02:04;01:02:09;"People might be like, ""Hey, don't make fun of Big Bang Theory"
01:02:09;01:02:14;"because my uncle became a millionaire off that show, so you watch your mouth."""
01:02:14;01:02:17;"What Golden Globes parties have you been to?"
01:02:17;01:02:21;"Mine are just filled with Chinese food and loving times."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Exclusively relatives of Big Bang Theory, of course."
01:02:24;01:02:31;"Okay, full disclosure, the last Golden Globes party I went to was Johnny Galecki's nephew."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"And I tried to poke a little bit of fun at Big Bang Theory."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I thought it's the biggest show on TV."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"I should be able to say a little something goofy, and he said,"
01:02:40;01:02:43;"""You shut your mouth, my uncle's Johnny Galecki."""
01:02:43;01:02:45;"I'm just saying that's the type of thing that doesn't happen in Asheville, North Carolina."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"That's true."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Have you guys ever been to Asheville, North Carolina?"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"You ever played the Orange Peel?"
01:02:50;01:02:54;"I want to say that we have, but I don't know for sure."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"If we haven't, then I really want to play there."
01:02:56;01:02:59;"It's a very cool town. It's one of my top towns of 2015."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"I think we were there together."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"With Dirty Projectors?"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"Yeah, 2005."
01:03:02;01:03:03;"We played a house."
01:03:03;01:03:04;"We played a house show."
01:03:04;01:03:06;"Oh, yeah. I've been there with Dirty Projectors and Vampire Weekend."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"That's tight."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"That's a great town. It's a college town."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"Yeah."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"It's a very hippie-ish town."
01:03:12;01:03:17;"A lot of New Age. Definitely there's a radical bookstore in town."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"A lot of Thai food."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"[laughter]"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"A lot of student Thai food."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"What does that mean?"
01:03:24;01:03:32;"I think it means the type of Thai restaurant where you go and your waiter is a 6'2"", 220 white dude with a headband."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Sure."
01:03:33;01:03:37;"That's what I'm picturing when I picture an Asheville Thai restaurant."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"So vivid. Such a vivid picture."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Second string quarterback."
01:03:42;01:03:49;"Excuse me, sir. Is the patio gluten-free?"
01:03:49;01:03:53;"You know, man, honestly, I'm not sure."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Let me check."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"[laughter]"
01:03:56;01:04:02;"I'll go ask in the kitchen, man, but if you're really allergic, I wouldn't hit it."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"[laughter]"
01:04:05;01:04:08;"Oh, door memories."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"[fireworks]"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"[fireworks]"
01:04:55;01:05:00;"[fireworks]"
01:05:05;01:05:15;"[fireworks]"
01:05:31;01:05:36;"Back to awards. Let's talk about what really matters. Awards."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"You got an award."
01:05:37;01:05:43;"I'm a professional musician, yes. And, yeah, me and those guys won a Grammy last year."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Well-deserved. A well-deserved Grammy."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"I'm sorry, what did you win a Grammy for?"
01:05:47;01:05:53;"Vampire Weekend won Best Alternative Album at the 2014 Grammys."
01:05:53;01:05:54;"And it was very well-deserved."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Very cool, man."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"[laughter]"
01:05:58;01:06:06;"Not everybody understands this. The Grammys have so many categories that the vast majority are not televised."
01:06:06;01:06:14;"So before the televised Grammys, you kind of go sit in this, in kind of like what feels a little bit like the JV room."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Oh, no."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"I'm not dissing it. I mean, like, look, whatever."
01:06:19;01:06:24;"But it's basically like, you know, at the Grammys, it's like you're in the Staples Center, you know."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"And it's like this big production."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"But before that, during the day, there's a smaller auditorium."
01:06:29;01:06:33;"People kind of are walking in and out. People are like talking a little bit."
01:06:33;01:06:40;"So I kind of remember, this is my vivid Grammy memory, is that I'm there with Rostam, Chris and Chris, Ariel,"
01:06:40;01:06:46;"who co-produced the album with Rostam, and we're all hanging out and kind of just waiting for our category,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"which was literally the last category."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"It was. I watched the whole thing."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"Of the pre-televised thing."
01:06:51;01:06:56;"And so I remember you're like kind of nervous and kind of also like, you know, what's going on?"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"And right before Best Alternative Album was all the Rap Awards."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"Yeah."
01:07:03;01:07:06;"So I'm sitting in the crowd kind of feeling nervous."
01:07:06;01:07:10;"Like, there's also this weird energy because people are walking in and out of the auditorium."
01:07:10;01:07:14;"You know, it feels a little bit like you're at some like auction or something."
01:07:14;01:07:19;"And I believe it was Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jim."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"I can't remember."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"I remember Cindy Lauper was the host."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Cindy Lauper was the host."
01:07:23;01:07:25;"But anyway, they're presenting all the Rap Awards."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"And Macklemore and Ryan Lewis had a clean sweep that year."
01:07:28;01:07:31;"And every, but they weren't even in the room."
01:07:31;01:07:36;"So basically every time they gave a Rap Award, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis won."
01:07:36;01:07:41;"And then they'd say, all right, well, you know, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis can't be here right now because, you know,"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"they're next door at the big show getting ready."
01:07:44;01:07:47;"So basically it's like all these awards go to Macklemore."
01:07:47;01:07:51;"And he's not even there to accept them because he's at the big show getting ready."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"And then they're like, OK, now."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"So like literally three or four in a row of like this."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"They're too busy to even come to this part of the Grammys and like."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"And now Best Alternative Album Vampire Weekend."
01:08:00;01:08:04;"It's kind of like you really I'm really going to get up there and give like a speech."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:08:05;01:08:08;"Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think you handled it amazingly."
01:08:08;01:08:15;"I mean, we all we all walked up and they handed it to me and I said, um, thank you."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"Yeah, I'm just saying, like, you know, I think that was the best way to do it."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"I'm just like, so rad up there."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Yeah, there's some good pictures."
01:08:21;01:08:25;"I always send Ariel this picture of me, like hoisting the Grammy in front of his face."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"I've seen it."
01:08:27;01:08:33;"But you know what I mean? Like, like if after Macklemore's a no show for three rap awards in a row."
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Imagine if I got up there."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Give an impassioned speech."
01:08:35;01:08:38;"And I was just like, wow."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"Taking the sin."
01:08:40;01:08:42;"What can I say?"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"Um, no, whatever."
01:08:43;01:08:49;"It was exciting and it was really it's nice that whoever voted for that category voted for us."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"It was very well deserved."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"And of course, yeah, we were proud of the work."
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Um, but anyway, that's my Grammy story."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"I'm going to go."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Oh,"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"oh,"
