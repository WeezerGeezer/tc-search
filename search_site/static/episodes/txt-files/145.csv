00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:03;00:06;"There's a lot of things we thought we might talk about today,"
00:06;00:08;"but we didn't get to them,"
00:08;00:10;"because we went deep."
00:10;00:12;"On Oasis,"
00:12;00:14;"The Black Crows,"
00:14;00:16;"Falco,"
00:16;00:18;"and the end of history,"
00:18;00:22;"this is a very special Time Crisis."
00:22;00:25;"And a little Grateful Dead and Talking Heads too."
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:38;"They passed me by,"
00:38;00:41;"all of those great romances."
00:41;00:45;"They were a palpably,"
00:45;00:48;"all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:51;"My picture clear,"
00:51;00:56;"everything seemed so easy."
00:56;00:59;"And so I dealt to the blow,"
00:59;01:02;"when a bus had to go."
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:10;"One of us is crying,"
01:10;01:13;"one of us is lying."
01:13;01:17;"Even only they."
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:19;01:22;"Nick just commented I look pretty Euro,"
01:22;01:24;"on the FaceTime."
01:24;01:26;"Tracksuit and Estella, it's just a different..."
01:26;01:29;"Ironically, I was trying to be all American,"
01:29;01:32;"because I wanted to wear a light jacket,"
01:32;01:35;"so I grabbed one of the sportier things I have."
01:35;01:39;"You know, like a classical American person."
01:39;01:42;"And it just so happens I have this,"
01:42;01:45;"Venetia FC track jacket,"
01:45;01:47;"that was gifted to me,"
01:47;01:50;"by somebody involved in the club."
01:50;01:52;"And then I wanted to drink a beer,"
01:52;01:53;"like an all American,"
01:53;01:55;"just happened that the only beer we had in the fridge,"
01:55;01:57;"were some Estella Artois."
01:57;01:59;"I think you look like, what I imagine,"
01:59;02:02;"Noel Gallagher's best friend/handler,"
02:02;02:05;"to appear like."
02:05;02:07;"Full tracksuit at all times."
02:07;02:09;"Is Noel sober now?"
02:09;02:11;"Are the Gallagher brothers sober?"
02:11;02:13;"I don't think so."
02:13;02:15;"I always get confused, Noel is the older brother."
02:15;02:16;"He's the songwriter."
02:16;02:18;"Oh yeah, I love him."
02:18;02:20;"Liam is sober."
02:20;02:22;"Yeah, I thought, okay."
02:22;02:25;"If one of them is sober, I would imagine the other isn't."
02:25;02:27;"Have we ever gone deep on Oasis?"
02:27;02:29;"No, we never have."
02:29;02:32;"That's really not the plan for this episode, but."
02:32;02:33;"You know, it's funny,"
02:33;02:35;"I don't think I talked about it on the show, but,"
02:35;02:39;"last year, somewhere in the middle of COVID,"
02:39;02:41;"I got really into watching,"
02:41;02:43;"like, really long,"
02:43;02:45;"Noel Gallagher interviews."
02:45;02:48;"And, you know, I always liked Oasis."
02:48;02:50;"I met Noel once, partied with him."
02:50;02:52;"Do tell, partied with him."
02:52;02:53;"Well, whatever, it was just like,"
02:53;02:56;"it was like at a hotel or something, people were drinking."
02:56;02:58;"Just chatted with him a bit."
02:58;03:00;"I thought he was a very nice and charming guy."
03:00;03:02;"Yeah, I've always liked Oasis, and, you know,"
03:02;03:04;"like, on Time Crisis,"
03:04;03:07;"obviously I've made it my mission to try to,"
03:07;03:10;"you know, never s*** talk fellow musicians."
03:10;03:12;"You never know what's going on with somebody else."
03:12;03:15;"You know, try not to be too cruel,"
03:15;03:16;"even if you don't like their music,"
03:16;03:18;"or you got an issue with them."
03:18;03:22;"I think you said once that s*** talk does not age well."
03:22;03:25;"And I've thought about that a lot since."
03:25;03:27;"That's a lesson that stuck with me."
03:27;03:28;"Oh, really?"
03:28;03:30;"I wonder if I'm right."
03:30;03:32;"Well, and also, the first thing that I think of"
03:32;03:35;"when I hear that again,"
03:35;03:37;"is also, like, even outside of, like,"
03:37;03:39;"the good bands talking s*** about each other,"
03:39;03:43;"even if you pick, like, an objectively cool person,"
03:43;03:45;"and then pick an objectively uncool person,"
03:45;03:47;"and, you know, people might take issue"
03:47;03:49;"that there's no such thing as objectively cool."
03:49;03:51;"But let's say a classically cool person"
03:51;03:53;"is a classically uncool person,"
03:53;03:55;"even that doesn't age well."
03:55;03:57;"Wait, do you mean that the classically uncool person"
03:57;03:58;"is s*** talking?"
03:58;04:00;"No, no, I mean the classically cool."
04:00;04:02;"I mean where the person might be right."
04:02;04:04;"Lou Reed is s*** talking on, like,"
04:04;04:06;"the guys in, like, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer."
04:06;04:08;"Or, like, Rush."
04:08;04:10;"[laughs]"
04:10;04:12;"I mean, yeah, yeah, for instance."
04:12;04:13;"That just cracks me up, just like..."
04:13;04:14;"Yeah, you could totally..."
04:14;04:16;"Well, Lou Reed also is such a..."
04:16;04:18;"He was an iconic, like, s*** talking,"
04:18;04:22;"angry guy, alienating figure to a lot of people."
04:22;04:26;"But yeah, of course Lou Reed is cooler than Rush."
04:26;04:28;"But for instance, yeah, if you, like,"
04:28;04:29;"with all this distance..."
04:29;04:31;"Who had more hits?"
04:31;04:32;"Rush?"
04:32;04:34;"Well, yeah."
04:34;04:35;"Who sold more records?"
04:35;04:36;"Definitely Rush."
04:36;04:38;"Who could shred harder?"
04:38;04:39;"[laughs]"
04:39;04:40;"Rush."
04:40;04:43;"Who was filling arenas 30 years"
04:43;04:45;"after a local Ohio radio station"
04:45;04:49;"first broke their single ""Working Man""?"
04:49;04:50;"It's Rush!"
04:50;04:51;"Like, picture even, like,"
04:51;04:54;"peak cool Lou Reed just being like,"
04:54;04:56;"""Man, I heard this Rush album."
04:56;04:59;"I mean, Neil Peart, man, his lyrics are trash."
04:59;05:00;"Stick to the drums."""
05:00;05:02;"Whatever he might say,"
05:02;05:04;"it wouldn't age well."
05:04;05:05;"It's just not cool."
05:05;05:06;"You know what I mean?"
05:06;05:07;"Like, especially looking back and be like,"
05:07;05:09;"they all had something to offer."
05:09;05:10;"Yeah."
05:10;05:12;"Well, I have to say,"
05:12;05:15;"that was one thing that kind of turned me off"
05:15;05:17;"on Oasis when I was younger."
05:17;05:19;"When they had their big hits in the '90s,"
05:19;05:21;"I liked their hits."
05:21;05:23;"""Wonderwall,"" ""Don't Look Back in Anger."""
05:23;05:25;"I was like, ""These are good songs."""
05:25;05:27;"And then the fact that they were so aggro"
05:27;05:28;"about crapping on every other band."
05:28;05:29;"Yeah."
05:29;05:31;"I was like, ""You know what?"
05:31;05:33;"I think that's coming from a place of insecurity, guys."""
05:33;05:35;"Like, listen, you like the Beatles."
05:35;05:36;"I like the Beatles."
05:36;05:37;"We all like the Beatles."
05:37;05:39;"You guys are doing, like, a Beatles thing."
05:39;05:41;"Like, a kind of late Beatles thing."
05:41;05:42;"Great."
05:42;05:44;"But the fact that they were so aggro"
05:44;05:46;"about that and other bands"
05:46;05:48;"and them just being like,"
05:48;05:49;"""If we had existed in the '60s,"
05:49;05:51;"we would have been just as big as the Beatles."""
05:51;05:52;"Probably true."
05:52;05:54;"But just sort of like a moot point."
05:54;05:56;"It would have been pretty confusing."
05:56;05:58;"A dumb hypothetical."
05:58;06:00;"I was always just like, ""Guys,"
06:00;06:01;"you're obviously insecure"
06:01;06:03;"that you don't have an original vision."""
06:03;06:05;"And it's showing."
06:05;06:06;"Well, totally."
06:06;06:07;"And that's what I was getting to,"
06:07;06:09;"is that I had the exact same feeling as you"
06:09;06:12;"because I don't like s***talkers."
06:12;06:13;"I've always been on record."
06:13;06:15;"I try to avoid it in my life, you know?"
06:15;06:18;"Like, give people the benefit of the doubt, you know?"
06:18;06:20;"Like, be nice whenever possible."
06:20;06:22;"And there was something about the"
06:22;06:24;"always just seeing these headlines"
06:24;06:25;"of Noel Gallagher talking s***"
06:25;06:27;"about just about everybody."
06:27;06:29;"And I think he often crossed the line."
06:29;06:31;"But as I went deeper on some of these interviews,"
06:31;06:34;"I was watching, like, an unedited, like,"
06:34;06:36;"interview in Japan in, like,"
06:36;06:38;"I don't know when this was, like, 2001."
06:38;06:41;"Like, 53 minutes uncut."
06:41;06:42;"And just kind of, like, feeling like"
06:42;06:45;"I was starting to get to know the guy a little better."
06:45;06:47;"I really started to develop a sense,"
06:47;06:49;"and I don't think this is a very original thought,"
06:49;06:51;"but I really started to get a sense"
06:51;06:53;"that he's not arrogant."
06:53;06:56;"Like, it's kind of just like some wrestling s***."
06:56;06:58;"He's, like, this funny Manchester dude."
06:58;06:59;"He's taking the s***."
07:00;07:02;"And if anything,"
07:02;07:05;"I think he could credibly make a case."
07:05;07:06;"'Cause some people talk s***"
07:06;07:08;"just because they're terrible,"
07:08;07:10;"mean-spirited, petty people"
07:10;07:11;"with a chip on their shoulder"
07:11;07:13;"and want to take other people down."
07:13;07:14;"Of course that exists."
07:14;07:17;"I think Noel Gallagher could credibly make the case"
07:17;07:18;"that he's trying to just, like,"
07:18;07:22;"stir s*** up for the good of the community."
07:22;07:23;"Kind of."
07:23;07:24;"Like, I started to get this vibe"
07:24;07:25;"watching all these long interviews"
07:25;07:28;"that it's a dude who is a music nerd,"
07:28;07:31;"knows his, like, music history inside and out,"
07:31;07:33;"worships the greats,"
07:33;07:35;"the Smiths, the Beatles, whoever,"
07:35;07:38;"and deeply wants or wanted--"
07:38;07:40;"he probably gave up by now--"
07:40;07:43;"he deeply wanted rock music to be more interesting"
07:43;07:45;"and full of, like, the big characters"
07:45;07:48;"that he was familiar with from his youth."
07:48;07:50;"I'm willing to believe that when he would s***"
07:50;07:52;"on, like, Radiohead or Sonic Youth,"
07:52;07:54;"which are, like, two--"
07:54;07:55;"it's just so funny, like,"
07:55;07:58;"just being like, ""What is this s***?"""
07:58;07:59;"""Come on, guys."""
07:59;08:00;"He's droning."
08:00;08:03;"That he really was coming from a place of almost, like--"
08:03;08:04;"I bet he deep down--"
08:04;08:05;"I don't know if he respected Sonic Youth,"
08:05;08:06;"but I think he--"
08:06;08:07;"I'm sure he respected Radiohead"
08:07;08:09;"because, you know, he's a songwriter."
08:09;08:10;"There's no way that he doesn't respect"
08:10;08:12;"the great Radiohead songs."
08:12;08:13;"He wanted them to be more like him."
08:13;08:16;"He, like, wants them to talk more s*** and stuff."
08:16;08:18;"Like, I truly believe that he thought"
08:18;08:19;"that'd be for the good of everybody"
08:19;08:21;"if things were a little more fun,"
08:21;08:24;"a little more WWE vibe."
08:24;08:25;"I love this generous read."
08:25;08:26;"It's a great read."
08:26;08:29;"Yeah, I'm sure I could be dissuaded from it,"
08:29;08:31;"but, like, I just really got this feeling"
08:31;08:33;"that he wasn't as arrogant as he seemed"
08:33;08:34;"'cause he would really, like,"
08:34;08:37;"take the s*** out of Oasis and himself."
08:37;08:38;"Like, there's one--"
08:38;08:40;"I feel like I saved it on my phone."
08:40;08:41;"Let me see if I have it."
08:41;08:44;"I was taking, like, little videos of, like, the TV."
08:44;08:46;"While Ezra finds this,"
08:46;08:47;"I was making that joke, obviously."
08:47;08:49;"They famously hate each other,"
08:49;08:50;"him and his brother."
08:50;08:54;"And when I said that Liam was sober,"
08:54;08:55;"I made that joke that, obviously,"
08:55;08:57;"Noel must be a drinker."
08:57;09:02;"The first article that comes up in the Daily Mail"
09:02;09:04;"is that Noel Gallagher admits"
09:04;09:06;"that he has ignored instructions not to panic buy"
09:06;09:09;"as he stockpiles alcohol for coronavirus."
09:09;09:11;"So not only is he not sober--"
09:11;09:13;"He literally started drinking more"
09:13;09:14;"when his brother got sober."
09:14;09:15;"He started drinking more"
09:15;09:16;"when he found out his brother was sober."
09:16;09:17;"Oh, wait, I--"
09:17;09:19;"Despite drinking."
09:19;09:20;"Amazing."
09:20;09:22;"Very healthy, despite drinking."
09:22;09:24;"I'm gonna play this into the mic."
09:24;09:25;"See, but then, like,"
09:25;09:27;"it's the thing that I don't understand."
09:27;09:28;"You know, like,"
09:28;09:31;"when, uh, when radio went,"
09:31;09:34;"put the little bit of sexy Sadie in ""Karma Police,"""
09:34;09:37;"um, everybody says that, you know, he's a genius."
09:37;09:39;"And when I put a little bit of Dave Prudence"
09:39;09:40;"in ""Who Feels Love,"""
09:40;09:41;"it's called pastiche, you know what I mean?"
09:41;09:43;"It's so--"
09:43;09:45;"People just don't [bleep] like me anymore."
09:45;09:46;"I've done some--"
09:47;09:48;"And I can't quite work out what it is,"
09:48;09:50;"but there you go."
09:50;09:51;"Did you hear what he was saying?"
09:51;09:53;"Yeah, he said when he--"
09:53;09:56;"when radio had put a little bit of what in ""Karma Police""?"
09:56;09:57;"A little bit of sexy Sadie."
09:57;09:58;"-Oh, okay. -Which they did."
09:58;09:59;"And he did a little--"
09:59;10:00;"-Yeah, he said-- -Right."
10:00;10:02;"Whatever he says, he says, ""They're geniuses."""
10:02;10:03;"I put a little bit of Dave Prudence"
10:03;10:05;"in some Oasis song, I don't know."
10:05;10:06;"It's pastiche."
10:06;10:08;"He does also have that funny--"
10:08;10:10;"which is so classically English,"
10:10;10:13;"like, the very intelligent working-class guy"
10:13;10:15;"who, like, plays up both sides"
10:15;10:17;"when he wants to be, like,"
10:17;10:19;"""Oh, me? Yeah, I'm just a regular-ass guy."""
10:19;10:20;"But then he also, like,"
10:20;10:22;"he knows [bleep] as well as anybody,"
10:22;10:23;"and he, like, drops it in a bit."
10:23;10:25;"And then at the end, he goes,"
10:25;10:26;"""Yeah, I don't know why."
10:26;10:28;"They just don't [bleep] like me."""
10:28;10:29;"It's a little Trump, too."
10:29;10:30;"Oh, yeah."
10:30;10:31;"We don't have to take it political,"
10:31;10:32;"but, you know, obviously,"
10:32;10:35;"Trump looms large as, like, a type of person."
10:35;10:37;"He does sometimes have that funny vibe"
10:37;10:38;"of just being like,"
10:38;10:39;"""I don't know. They just don't [bleep] like me."""
10:39;10:42;"You kind of get this impression that he's not actually--"
10:42;10:44;"and this is where he differs from Trump--"
10:44;10:46;"that he actually has a sense of humor"
10:46;10:47;"about people not liking him."
10:47;10:49;"-Oh, absolutely. -Listen to this clip."
10:49;11:08;"[video playing]"
11:08;11:10;"-There's something funny-- -I love him."
11:10;11:12;"Yeah, I started to love him with those quotes,"
11:12;11:14;"just, like, picturing him doing an interview in Japan,"
11:14;11:16;"like, early 2000s."
11:16;11:18;"He's, like, in his mid-30s,"
11:18;11:20;"and he's just, like, feeling kind of frustrated"
11:20;11:22;"and just going like, ""I'm a man."
11:22;11:24;"I'm not a boy no more."""
11:24;11:27;"Just that line, like, the way it rolls off the tongue is great."
11:27;11:30;"And then just, like, again, not exactly arrogant,"
11:30;11:32;"just being like, ""I was great."
11:32;11:35;"Might be great again. Who knows?"
11:35;11:37;"I'm good at what I do. Let's leave it."""
11:37;11:39;"Just, like, thinking out loud, just being kind of like--"
11:39;11:41;"Like, he knows that their first two albums"
11:41;11:43;"are, like, stone-cold classics."
11:43;11:46;"Three and four get into some weirder territory."
11:46;11:48;"And he's just, like, kind of there being like,"
11:48;11:49;"""Yeah, I don't know."""
11:49;11:52;"There was just something about it that actually felt very honest."
11:52;11:54;"It didn't feel-- It made me realize"
11:54;11:57;"that there's this other dimension to the sh---talking."
11:57;11:59;"And I found it kind of charming."
11:59;12:01;"Because if the same person who's out there just sh---talking,"
12:01;12:03;"stirring stuff up, never breaks,"

12:14;12:16;"He takes the sh-- out of himself a bit."
12:16;12:19;"Yeah, I think my first response to them"
12:19;12:21;"was, like, when I was, like, 18,"
12:21;12:24;"in, like, the mid-'90s, and I didn't have--"
12:24;12:26;"I don't know, yeah, the long view"
12:26;12:29;"or the nuanced sort of understanding."
12:29;12:31;"So I just took them very seriously"
12:31;12:33;"and literally what they were saying."
12:33;12:35;"It's definitely, like, struck me over the years"
12:35;12:37;"as, like, more and more funny"
12:37;12:39;"and less and less serious."

13:35;13:37;"Oh, yeah, the Scottish power pop band."
13:37;13:39;"Yeah, and they were, like, recording"
13:39;13:41;"at some... maybe, like, you know,"
13:41;13:43;"like, one of the big studios in London or something."
13:43;13:45;"And then, next door was Oasis,"
13:45;13:47;"and they were just like, ""Oh, my God, what is this gonna be like?"""
13:47;13:49;"And then Oasis popped out, and they were just, like,"
13:49;13:51;"the hugest Teenage Fan Club fans."
13:51;13:53;"And then you're sort of like, ""Oh, I can kind of see that."
13:53;13:55;"I can kind of..."" Yeah, yeah, yeah."
13:55;13:57;"Or they were just being nice to their face."
13:57;13:59;"But it seemed like it was... from the interview,"
13:59;14:00;"it seemed, like, very genuine."
14:00;14:02;"Oh, yeah, I could totally believe that."
14:02;14:04;"Just being deep. Yeah."
14:04;14:06;"Deep in a Teenage Fan Club and, like..."
14:06;14:07;"Deep into Stone Roses."
14:07;14:09;"Oh, definitely."
14:09;14:11;"He just didn't like the arty stuff."
14:11;14:13;"He loved the Beatles. He, like... maybe he likes the middle ground."
14:13;14:15;"I also like that, um..."
14:15;14:17;"if anybody's ever seen that"
14:17;14:19;"really good documentary that came out"
14:19;14:21;"a few years ago about them,"
14:21;14:23;"Noel, before they started the band,"
14:23;14:25;"he also just worked on the road crew"
14:25;14:27;"for Inspiral Carpets,"
14:27;14:29;"who was, like, a Manchester band"
14:29;14:31;"that kind of, like, was"
14:31;14:33;"big-ish in the late '80s, early '90s."
14:33;14:35;"Oh, wow, I didn't know that."
14:35;14:37;"Yeah, they were kind of, like, part of the same"
14:37;14:39;"wave as, like,"
14:39;14:41;"Happy Mondays and stuff. But there's also"
14:41;14:43;"just something about it where I was just, like..."
14:43;14:45;"I guess also the fact that he worked"
14:45;14:47;"on another band's crew for a while"
14:47;14:49;"also just, like, endeared me to him."
14:49;14:51;"I was just kind of like, ""All right."""
14:51;14:53;"He, like... maybe he feels like, ""You know what? I worked my way up."""
14:53;14:55;"Like, when you said ""road crew"""
14:55;14:57;"initially, I thought you meant, like, he worked on a literal, like,"
14:57;14:59;"road crew doing, like, construction."
14:59;15:01;"[laughs] Yeah, I mean..."
15:01;15:03;"Which also would not have surprised me."
15:03;15:05;"I would have never even thought of that."
15:05;15:07;"Man, I have a visceral memory of"
15:07;15:09;"hearing ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" for the first time"
15:09;15:11;"when it was a single"
15:11;15:13;"in, like, '95 or '96 or whatever."
15:13;15:15;"So, at that point, I would have been"
15:15;15:17;"18 or 19, and I didn't know, like,"
15:17;15:19;"all the Beatles' solo albums at that point."
15:19;15:21;"I remember thinking,"
15:21;15:23;"""Oh, is this, like, a George Harrison"
15:23;15:25;"solo cut that I've never heard?"""
15:25;15:27;"Yeah. It's a great song,"
15:27;15:29;"and it's so triumphant."
15:29;15:31;"And the recording was, like..."
15:31;15:33;"I feel like I was pretty tapped in at that point on, like,"
15:33;15:35;"the subtle nuances and, like, recording."
15:35;15:37;"Uh-huh. Or maybe not so subtle"
15:37;15:39;"recording, sort of production techniques,"
15:39;15:41;"you know, across the decades."
15:41;15:43;"And I literally thought it was, like, a lost song"
15:43;15:45;"from the '70s. I could see that."
15:45;15:47;"That song in particular."
15:47;15:49;"Yeah, it had, like, a good attention to detail."
15:49;15:51;"And also, it is funny, too,"
15:51;15:53;"that it's, like, you know, in the UK,"
15:53;15:55;"Oasis..."
15:55;15:57;"You know, in the US, people..."
15:57;15:59;"the average person knows, like,"
15:59;16:01;"two, maybe three Oasis songs."
16:01;16:03;"There's a few hits that loom large."
16:03;16:05;"Yeah. Whereas in the UK, they have, like,"
16:05;16:07;"like, 15"
16:07;16:09;"all-time smash classics."
16:09;16:11;"And obviously, their story..."
16:11;16:13;"Everybody knows the ins and outs of their story"
16:13;16:15;"and the brothers and after the band."
16:15;16:17;"And they're also part of, like,"
16:17;16:19;"the Oasis versus Blur"
16:19;16:21;"and Britpop and the history of Manchester."
16:21;16:23;"There's just, like, so much context"
16:23;16:25;"for Oasis being, like,"
16:25;16:27;"the band of the '90s. And I feel like"
16:27;16:29;"I have kind of a similar memory"
16:29;16:31;"of, like, hearing that song on, like,"
16:31;16:33;"the radio in the '90s"
16:33;16:35;"and just also having this sense of just, like,"
16:35;16:37;"""Wait, where is this from?"""
16:37;16:39;"Oasis was, like, randomly really big"
16:39;16:41;"in America for essentially"
16:41;16:43;"one album. It did feel"
16:43;16:45;"like just, like, this weird"
16:45;16:47;"breakthrough from the UK. Like,"
16:47;16:49;"zero context and then, like,"
16:49;16:51;"kind of went back to just being a British band again."
16:51;16:53;"Matt sent this great"
16:53;16:55;"interview with Tom DeLonge from"
16:55;16:57;"Blink-182 giving this anecdote"
16:57;16:59;"about Liam Gallagher coming up"
16:59;17:01;"to him after a show where they"
17:01;17:03;"were on the same bill. And he says,"
17:03;17:05;"""You're the best I've seen in America."""
17:05;17:07;"And I go, ""You"
17:07;17:09;"like us?"" And he goes, ""I didn't say that,"
17:09;17:11;"but you're the best I've seen in America."""
17:11;17:13;"And then he slammed the door."
17:13;17:15;"That's Liam Gallagher? Oh my god."
17:15;17:17;"Yeah, Liam. I didn't say that."
17:17;17:19;"They're the best. They're the best. I didn't say that."
17:19;17:21;"That's so funny. And also, back"
17:21;17:23;"to, like, the sh*t-talking concept, like,"
17:23;17:25;"of course, it's always kinder not"
17:25;17:27;"to. I get the impression,"
17:27;17:29;"and again, I could be wrong, of, like,"
17:29;17:31;"those dudes, that it's, like,"
17:31;17:33;"the type of dudes who would"
17:33;17:35;"f*ck the talk, abandon the press,"
17:35;17:37;"just to keep things interesting, and then"
17:37;17:39;"actually be, like, really nice behind the scenes"
17:39;17:41;"because people are people, and,"
17:41;17:43;"you know? They actually have some"
17:43;17:45;"generosity of spirit"
17:45;17:47;"versus the opposite, which, you know,"
17:47;17:49;"is maybe more like the Hollywood,"
17:49;17:51;"like, weird American version"
17:51;17:53;"of just, like, the type of person"
17:53;17:55;"who would, like, maybe say something really"
17:55;17:57;"nice publicly, but"
17:57;17:59;"then be, like, incapable of, like,"
17:59;18:01;"connecting on a human level"
18:01;18:03;"because they are just"
18:03;18:05;"too, like, they don't have generosity"
18:05;18:07;"of spirit. So, obviously, those are"
18:07;18:09;"two extremes you don't really"
18:09;18:11;"need to do either, but"
18:11;18:13;"I think Oasis is a little more"
18:13;18:15;"the other one. And you gotta"
18:15;18:17;"give it up for Oasis. Just, like,"
18:17;18:19;"very durable hits."
18:19;18:21;"I would be happy to hear"

21:22;21:25;"where, like, one of the dudes in Black Girls"

22:56;22:58;"Very in the mix."

24:12;24:14;"for breast cancer awareness."
24:14;24:15;"So they shared the same stage."
24:15;24:16;"What?"
24:16;24:17;"Deep."
24:17;24:18;"Wait, what year was that?"
24:18;24:20;"2015."
24:20;24:21;"It's called ""Boobs""?"
24:21;24:22;"It's called--"
24:22;24:23;"It's ""Boobs"" plural?"
24:23;24:25;"""Boob Spelled Backwards is Boob."""
24:25;24:26;"Okay, right."
24:26;24:27;"'Cause that's actually true."
24:27;24:28;"Oh, it's a new ode."
24:28;24:30;"It's a new ode."
24:30;24:31;"So it happened to have been penned--"
24:31;24:32;"Okay, here we go."
24:32;24:34;"Penned by auspicious 8-year-old"
24:34;24:36;"Archer Nelson in direct--"
24:36;24:37;"This is insane."
24:37;24:39;"In direct response to the diagnosis"
24:39;24:41;"of his mother with breast cancer,"
24:41;24:42;"a tender little diddy,"
24:42;24:44;"""Boobs Spelled Backwards is Boob,"""
24:44;24:46;"pulls assuredly at the heartstrings."
24:46;24:47;"The teardrop acts as a love letter"
24:47;24:48;"and encouragement."
24:48;24:50;"So an 8-year-old who had found out"
24:50;24:51;"his mom was diagnosed with breast cancer"
24:51;24:52;"writes this song,"
24:52;24:56;"and then Florence Welch, Noel Gallagher,"
24:56;24:57;"and Phil Esch and Bill Grudson"
24:57;24:59;"perform it on stage."
24:59;25:01;"It is sweet, but it definitely means"
25:01;25:04;"that the hatred can't be that deep."
25:04;25:08;"Phil Esch has no idea who Noel was."
25:08;25:11;"It looks like Liam has a Grateful Dead"
25:11;25:13;"reference on his song ""Greedy Soul."""
25:13;25:14;"What does he say?"
25:14;25:16;"""Greedy Soul, she's got a spinning head,"
25:16;25:18;"like seeing Grateful Dead."""
25:18;25:19;"Okay."
25:19;25:21;"Man, I can't believe there's not"
25:21;25:23;"like some deeper..."
25:23;25:25;"All those guys do is talk."
25:25;25:27;"We gotta get Noel on the show now."
25:27;25:29;"He would love to just spend an hour"
25:29;25:32;"just like talking about bands."
25:32;25:33;"Yeah."
25:33;25:35;"Honestly, that would be a great interview."
25:35;25:37;"We just make a list of like every band"
25:37;25:39;"we can think of to want to get his take on."
25:39;25:40;"Mm-hmm."
25:40;25:42;"It's like guided by voices, go."
25:42;25:44;"I just feel like there'd be so many surprises."
25:44;25:45;"He would just be like..."
25:45;25:46;"Yeah."
25:46;25:48;"""Night, Alien Lanes changed my life."""
25:48;25:50;"I really actually wonder what he thinks of GBV."
25:50;25:53;"I always thought there was a GBV oasis."
25:53;25:56;"A Venn diagram with the Beatles right in the middle."
25:56;25:57;"Oh, yeah."
25:57;26:00;"There's definitely some shared DNA."
26:00;26:03;"Yeah, I feel like he'd be kind of into it."
26:03;26:05;"I could also see him not knowing that band"
26:05;26:08;"because he was a huge rock star"
26:08;26:10;"by the time GBV broke."
26:10;26:12;"I might be off here because now I'm painting"
26:12;26:15;"this picture of him as being like this gruff dude"
26:15;26:18;"who behind closed doors is actually a very sweet guy"
26:18;26:20;"who doesn't take himself seriously."
26:20;26:22;"There's probably somebody listening who is like,"
26:22;26:24;"""You're so deeply wrong."""
26:24;26:27;"But I'm picturing him having deep generosity of spirit."
26:27;26:30;"And I'm also picturing him being like a music nerd."
26:30;26:36;"I'm kind of picturing him on tour, mid-90s,"
26:36;26:40;"hitting the Amoeba in Berkeley,"
26:40;26:43;"just walking out with armfuls of all the latest"
26:43;26:47;"Matador releases, just checking in on everything,"
26:47;26:50;"just going deep and being like, ""All right, all right."
26:50;26:51;"Yeah, yeah."""
26:51;26:54;"That really says that his public persona was a character."
26:54;26:58;"I do think he was legitimately very arrogant."
26:58;27:01;"And arrogance leads to a disinterest in others' music."
27:01;27:03;"Or it would just be like, ""Oh, Matador?"
27:03;27:04;"That's all arty stuff."""
27:04;27:06;"Yeah, like, ""No, what do you think of Pavement?"
27:06;27:07;"No, what do you think of Nirvana?"
27:07;27:09;"Dinosaur Jr."""
27:09;27:10;"It'd be interesting."
27:10;27:14;"Hate Pavement, deeply respect GBV,"
27:14;27:17;"like some early Dinosaur Jr."
27:17;27:20;"I guess he's also a nationalist."
27:20;27:21;"You got to keep that in mind, too."
27:21;27:23;"Loves Stone Temple Pilots."
27:23;27:24;"Maybe."
27:24;27:25;"That's true. He's a nationalist."
27:25;27:26;"He's a nationalist."
27:26;27:28;"The British flags and all that shit."
27:28;27:31;"I could also just picture him just being deeply uninterested"
27:31;27:32;"in American rock."
27:32;27:34;"Maybe because Americans weren't interested enough"
27:34;27:37;"in Stone Roses and in spiral carpets."
27:37;27:40;"So he has to kind of repay the favor."
27:40;27:43;"This is fun, speculating on the Noel Gallagher interview"
27:43;27:44;"on the land."
27:44;27:47;"If we don't get him, we're going to create a Noel Gallagher AI,"
27:47;27:49;"and we're going to do a two-hour special."
27:49;27:51;"We're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars"
27:51;27:53;"developing a Noel Gallagher AI,"
27:53;27:56;"and then we're going to ask it about all sorts of just, like,"
27:56;27:57;"random shit."
27:57;28:02;"Just like, ""Noel, the Lemonheads, go."""
28:02;28:05;"I got a list here of some Noel Burns on various bands."
28:05;28:06;"Do you want to hear a couple?"
28:06;28:07;"Sure."
28:07;28:09;"We'd love it."
28:09;28:12;"Okay, we got Noel on Radiohead."
28:12;28:15;"I reckon if Tom York [expletive] it into a light bulb"
28:15;28:17;"and started blowing it like an empty beer bottle,"
28:17;28:21;"it'd probably get 9 out of 10 in [expletive] Mojo."
28:21;28:22;"He's not wrong."
28:22;28:26;"And also, that's not even necessarily a Radiohead diss."
28:26;28:28;"That's just, like, cultural commentary."
28:28;28:29;"Yes."
28:29;28:30;"Yeah."
28:30;28:31;"Arctic Monkeys."
28:31;28:33;"Do you want to hear about Jack White?"
28:33;28:34;"What do you have to say about him?"
28:34;28:35;"Yes, please, please."
28:35;28:38;"Jack White, he looks like Zorro on Donuts."
28:38;28:39;"I remember that one."
28:39;28:42;"What's Donuts?"
28:42;28:43;"Is that a drug?"
28:43;28:44;"He was body shaming him."
28:44;28:45;"That's not cool."
28:45;28:46;"Oh, okay."
28:46;28:52;"What's so odious about being fat?"
28:52;28:53;"Okay, Jim Morrison would not approve."
28:53;28:55;"Wait, he said something about Arctic Monkeys?"
28:55;28:58;"I would rather drink petrol straight from the nozzle at a garage"
28:58;29:02;"than listen to an interview with Alex Turner from the Arctic Monkeys."
29:02;29:03;"That's via--"
29:03;29:05;"I guess it's not about the music, is my--"
29:05;29:08;"That one kind of works for my hypothesis."
29:08;29:11;"Because I would imagine if you're Noel Gallagher"
29:11;29:13;"and you see Arctic Monkeys come out"
29:13;29:17;"and you are a hardcore rock nationalist,"
29:17;29:20;"you would have to have some sense of pride"
29:20;29:25;"that there's another big northern UK rock band coming out."
29:25;29:27;"You would have to imagine he likes the music."
29:27;29:30;"But I almost, when I hear that quote, again with zero context,"
29:30;29:34;"I'm picturing him being like, ""Mate, the music's all right,"
29:34;29:38;"but your interview game is lacking."""
29:38;29:41;"Maybe he's almost just disappointed."
29:41;29:48;"Just like, ""Alex, we have a great tradition of UK rock dude interviews."
29:48;29:51;"I need you to think more holistically, man."
29:51;29:53;"I need you to come out and say more spicy sh*t."""
29:53;29:55;"You know what would roll if Noel came out"
29:55;29:59;"and just did a rock-based stand-up special?"
29:59;30:02;"Or one of those Eminem songs where he disses 50 people"
30:02;30:04;"in the span of an entire song?"
30:04;30:07;"Just like, taking it to the..."
30:07;30:08;"Here's what he said."
30:08;30:11;"So this is Noel on the worst band he's ever heard."
30:11;30:14;"""Do you ever look at the sky and think, 'I'm glad I'm alive?'"
30:14;30:16;"After I heard Sum 41, I thought,"
30:16;30:19;"'I'm actually alive to hear the sh*ttiest band of all time.'"""
30:19;30:22;"Which is quite something when you think about it."
30:22;30:24;"(imitates guitar riff)"
30:24;30:25;"Harsh."
30:25;30:26;"(imitates guitar riff)"
30:26;30:28;"But kind of deep, too."
30:28;30:31;"It is just like, honestly, putting it that way"
30:31;30:34;"is like, 10 times more interesting"
30:34;30:38;"than just being like, ""That band sucks. I hate them."""
30:38;30:40;"Well, it's also weird that his brother--"
30:40;30:42;"Wait, was it Blink-182 that his brother said"
30:42;30:44;"was the best he'd seen in America?"
30:44;30:45;"Yes."
30:45;30:48;"So, I mean, to me-- Maybe I'm crazier,"
30:48;30:52;"but Blink-182 and Sum 41, that's a similar universe."
30:52;30:53;"Sure."
30:53;30:55;"But you know what? They're brothers."
30:55;30:57;"Doesn't mean they have the same taste."
30:57;30:59;"No, in fact, they go out of their way not to."
30:59;31:01;"They don't get the pop punk."
31:01;31:02;"What else you got, Seinfeld?"
31:02;31:04;"Well, not so much."
31:04;31:07;"We got Billy Joe Armstrong."
31:07;31:09;"He said-- Oh, this is Liam, though."
31:09;31:11;"This is Liam. Do you want to hear what Liam had to say?"
31:11;31:12;"Okay, sure."
31:12;31:14;"""F*ck right off. I'm not having him."
31:14;31:16;"I just don't like his head."""
31:16;31:19;"What, he likes Blink and he doesn't like Green Day?"
31:19;31:21;"""He doesn't like his head."""
31:21;31:23;"(laughs)"
31:23;31:25;"It's not about the music."
31:25;31:28;"There's something about-- I can't fully explain it,"
31:28;31:31;"but there's-- Maybe because in the UK,"
31:31;31:35;"it's a smaller country, there's this really dedicated rock press"
31:35;31:36;"for a long time."
31:36;31:39;"I do think there's this-- It's almost like a tradition"
31:39;31:43;"of bands, and there's a way that sometimes"
31:43;31:47;"UK rock stars from that era talk about stuff"
31:47;31:49;"in this really straightforward way,"
31:49;31:52;"where it's almost just like-- I don't know how to put it."
31:52;31:54;"It's almost more like sports or something,"
31:54;31:57;"where they're just like, ""All right, you got some moves,"
31:57;31:59;"but you can't hit threes for sh*t."""
31:59;32:02;"They have this funny-- It makes me think of reading"
32:02;32:05;"The Bassist from Blur's book."
32:05;32:08;"That came out right when Vampire Weekend first toured the UK,"
32:08;32:11;"and I think one of us bought it at-- Who knows?"
32:11;32:13;"Literally could have been a rest stop,"
32:13;32:15;"and everybody ended up reading it."
32:15;32:17;"His name is Alex James."
32:17;32:19;"The Bassist from Blur."
32:19;32:21;"Seems like an interesting guy. Good-looking."
32:21;32:23;"And I just remember in the book--"
32:23;32:26;"Because he wasn't the primary songwriter by any stretch."
32:26;32:28;"There's obviously a Damon Albarn,"
32:28;32:31;"and then you have Graham,"
32:31;32:33;"who also wrote some great songs,"
32:33;32:35;"or Coffee and TV, a very strong single."
32:35;32:38;"And his vibe talking about the band,"
32:38;32:41;"he would just always talk about the superficial elements,"
32:41;32:43;"but in this funny way."
32:43;32:45;"And I just remember there's at least a few times"
32:45;32:47;"in the book that he talks about haircuts,"
32:47;32:49;"and he was just talking--"
32:49;32:51;"He's talking about his own haircut,"
32:51;32:53;"and he's talking about--"
32:53;32:55;"This line that always stood out to me,"
32:55;32:58;"he's talking about also-ran-type"
32:58;33:01;"failed musicians from his generation."
33:01;33:04;"He just said, ""Yeah, you know, there's this type of dude."
33:04;33:06;"They're pretty good at music,"
33:06;33:08;"but they could just never get their hair right."""
33:08;33:10;"And it was just this funny thing"
33:10;33:12;"for a '90s guy in a band to say."
33:12;33:15;"Just like, ""Yeah, you gotta feel for these guys."
33:15;33:17;"They just never get their hair right."""
33:17;33:19;"It reminds me of this Liam Gallagher,"
33:19;33:21;"just like, ""F*** off. I don't like your head."""
33:21;33:24;"It's almost like there's some sort of cultural understanding"
33:24;33:26;"in that era of British bands"
33:26;33:29;"that being in a band is kind of bulls***."
33:29;33:31;"Almost there's an acceptance"
33:31;33:34;"that it's some funny mix of modeling"
33:34;33:37;"meets just corporate marketing"
33:37;33:39;"meets a bit of art."
33:39;33:41;"I don't know why. I just can't think of"
33:41;33:43;"quite an American equivalent."
33:43;33:45;"Or in America, maybe we'd associate that type of talk"
33:45;33:47;"more with other genres."
33:47;33:49;"But in the UK, it's understood."
33:49;33:51;"""Yeah, rock and roll, baby. Just another form of pop music."
33:51;33:53;"Get your f***ing haircut right."""
33:53;33:55;"It sounds like they have sort of an '80s"
33:55;33:57;"hair metal band attitude."
33:57;33:59;"But their look is obviously much different."
33:59;34:03;"Whereas in the '90s, in that era in America,"
34:03;34:05;"the bands that were big were like,"
34:05;34:07;"at least in terms of their image,"
34:07;34:09;"were anti-corporate and anti-image."
34:09;34:11;"They couldn't admit it."
34:11;34:13;"Obviously, Kurt was very image-concerned."
34:13;34:15;"I've talked before about you look at his notebooks."
34:15;34:18;"He was a student of rock history."
34:18;34:20;"He knew you had to get the logo right."
34:20;34:22;"You had to get all that s*** on deck."
34:22;34:24;"He cared."
34:24;34:26;"But yet, you could never picture Kurt Cobain"
34:26;34:28;"in an interview where he'd just like..."
34:28;34:30;"You imagine somebody being like,"
34:30;34:32;"""So, Kurt, you guys really exploded out of the scene."
34:32;34:34;"But there's a lot of hard-rocking Seattle-based bands"
34:34;34:36;"with roots in punk rock."
34:36;34:38;"What is it about you guys?"""
34:38;34:40;"And just be like, ""Okay, well, first of all,"
34:40;34:42;"a lot of these dudes just can't get their f***ing hair right."
34:42;34:44;"I'm sorry. Say what you will."
34:44;34:46;"But me, Chris, and Dave,"
34:46;34:48;"our hair f***ing looks correct."""
34:48;34:50;"Even if he felt that..."
34:50;34:52;"I mean, Chris has got that burly goatee."
34:52;34:54;"I mean, come on."
34:54;34:56;"It kind of just worked."
34:56;35:03;"and it just worked!"
35:03;35:30;"Two bands I wonder what Noel thinks."
35:30;35:44;"He's toured with Smashing Pumpkins."
35:44;36:12;"I think he's been on that tour."
36:12;36:15;"I actually saw that tour."
36:15;36:17;"I missed Noel."
36:17;36:19;"I saw the Pumpkins at the Forum."
36:19;36:21;"I went with my brother."
36:21;36:22;"But we came in late."
36:22;36:23;"We missed the opening."
36:23;36:24;"I missed Noel?"
36:24;36:25;"Damn."
36:25;36:27;"I guess I missed Noel."
36:27;36:29;"Missed the first 40 minutes of the show."
36:29;36:32;"He also managed to take a swipe at Billy Corgan."
36:32;36:35;"I guess right while they were on tour he told Rolling Stone"
36:35;36:38;"we were in the studio together one time in LA."
36:38;36:39;"This was back in the day."
36:39;36:41;"I don't remember a great deal about it"
36:41;36:43;"apart from I think Billy had just bought a new Ferrari"
36:43;36:45;"and he was very proud."
36:45;36:47;"He continues, ""I remember smoking a cigarette"
36:47;36:49;"looking at this Ferrari thinking, 'I'm not into cars."
36:49;36:51;"It's just a f***ing car.'"""
36:51;36:52;"You know what I mean?"
36:52;36:53;"Yes."
36:53;36:55;"I feel you."
36:55;36:59;"Dude, Noel Gallagher and Billy Corgan hanging out in the 90s"
36:59;37:01;"is rough stuff."
37:01;37:03;"And this Billy being like,"
37:03;37:06;"""Noel, you want to see my new Ferrari?"""
37:06;37:09;"And him just walking out and just being like,"
37:09;37:11;"""What do you want me to f***ing say?"
37:11;37:12;"It's a car, man."""
37:12;37:14;"Oh my God."
37:14;37:16;"I'm just a working class bloke from Manchester, man."
37:16;37:18;"I don't care about your car, dude."
37:18;37:23;"And regarding the chili peppers,"
37:23;37:28;"Liam rips them for calling them undignified."
37:28;37:30;"Things are undignified."
37:30;37:31;"Oh, s***."
37:31;37:33;"For playing stadium shows."
37:33;37:36;"But again, and I love this."
37:36;37:38;"For these reunion tours playing or whatever,"
37:38;37:40;"playing these giant shows, he calls them undignified."
37:40;37:44;"And his brother's response is he goes on tour with them."
37:44;37:46;"So Noel then went on tour."
37:46;37:47;"With the chili peppers?"
37:47;37:48;"With the chilies?"
37:48;37:50;"He's on tour with everybody."
37:50;37:52;"Chilies, pumpkins?"
37:52;37:53;"I think he's just, yeah."
37:53;37:57;"If Liam says he doesn't like somebody or vice versa,"
37:57;38:00;"maybe it actually, I imagine actually it's vice versa."
38:00;38:02;"I imagine Noel said, ""I'll open for you."""
38:02;38:04;"And then Liam was like, ""They're undignified."""
38:04;38:06;"Well, okay."
38:06;38:09;"Everything for them does seem to come down actually more to"
38:09;38:13;"his hatred for his brother than actually any band."
38:13;38:17;"I like the idea of Liam doubling down on his love of American punk."
38:17;38:20;"So Liam's going to tour with the Joyce Manor."
38:20;38:22;"[laughs]"
38:22;38:25;"And then Noel's going to keep touring with these classic rock acts."
38:25;38:27;"Or like classic rock ripoff acts."
38:27;38:29;"Dude, Noel's going to tour with Dead & Co."
38:29;38:30;"Oh, yeah."
38:30;38:31;"Is this a grift?"
38:31;38:32;"Like one of them says something about--"
38:32;38:34;"Liam rips Dead & Co. a new one."
38:34;38:35;"[laughs]"
38:35;38:39;"John Mayer has no tone touch or lyricism."
38:39;38:43;"Noel responds, ""He's actually come a really long way."
38:43;38:47;"He's definitely tapping into some Prime Jerry, chromaticism."""
38:47;38:50;"[laughs]"
38:50;38:52;"They really do keep things interesting."
38:52;38:55;"I mean, we just spent an hour talking about Oasis."
38:55;38:58;"Wasn't planning on it, so."
38:58;39:00;"Not on the docket at all."
39:00;39:01;"Not on the docket at all."
39:01;39:02;"I was great."
39:02;39:04;"I might be great again."
39:04;39:05;"Who knows?"
39:15;39:19;"She is after you right now"
39:19;39:22;"The one I love"
39:22;39:26;"The one I love"
39:26;39:29;"She is telling me"
39:29;39:36;"She is after you right now"
39:36;39:40;"The one I love"
39:44;39:47;"She told me to fly"
39:47;39:51;"She told me how to fly"
39:51;39:54;"The one I love"
39:54;39:58;"The one I love"
39:58;40:01;"She told me to fly"
40:01;40:07;"She brings me up and I can fly"
40:07;40:10;"The last thing I'll say about this is"
40:10;40:13;"I think I have told this story on the program before"
40:13;40:17;"but we were, I think, playing right before them"
40:17;40:21;"in 2009 at a festival in Paris"
40:21;40:23;"and I didn't see this happen"
40:23;40:25;"I remember hearing some commotion"
40:25;40:28;"in the much larger dressing area next to ours"
40:28;40:30;"and I think some of the other guys in the band"
40:30;40:34;"saw what turned out to be a $50,000 guitar"
40:34;40:36;"fly into the air"
40:36;40:38;"and crash back to the ground"
40:38;40:40;"and this became famously known later"
40:40;40:43;"that this was the fight that ended Oasis"
40:43;40:47;"that involved Liam destroying Noel's $50,000 guitar"
40:47;40:49;"and they didn't go on"
40:49;40:52;"so I remember, like, we played"
40:52;40:54;"maybe somebody else played then"
40:54;40:56;"you know, but everybody's lined up"
40:56;40:58;"ready for Oasis to play"
40:58;41:01;"and then I remember, like, just hearing"
41:01;41:03;"somebody go on and tell the audience"
41:03;41:05;"in French, like"
41:05;41:07;"Oasis will not be performing tonight"
41:07;41:10;"and just, like, hearing, like, 50,000 people"
41:10;41:11;"like, ""Whoa!"""
41:11;41:14;"and then I remember, like, it was this weird vibe"
41:14;41:16;"and me and CT walked out"
41:16;41:18;"and we're kind of just, like, checking out what the vibe was"
41:18;41:20;"and we were walking along the rail"
41:20;41:22;"and we, like, chatted with, like, a few people"
41:22;41:24;"and I do remember seeing, like, random people"
41:24;41:26;"just, like, in tears"
41:26;41:28;"they'd been waiting so long to see Oasis"
41:28;41:30;"and they probably didn't even know that the band was breaking up"
41:30;41:32;"I remember at the time being like, ""Really?"
41:32;41:33;"Who cares?"""
41:33;41:34;"and then I thought"
41:34;41:36;"but then I realized, like, oh, damn"
41:36;41:38;"this is, like, these are some French"
41:38;41:40;"Oasis superfans been waiting forever"
41:40;41:41;"and now they don't get to see them"
41:41;41:42;"yeah, that is pretty harsh"
41:42;41:45;"but anyway, outside of all that"
41:45;41:48;"because Noel, in these long interviews"
41:48;41:50;"he reveals this side of his personality"
41:50;41:52;"that seems so kind of just, like, funny"
41:52;41:54;"aloof and not self-serious"
41:54;41:57;"it's always made me wonder"
41:57;41:59;"if the hatred between the brothers"
41:59;42:02;"is some type of, like, kayfabe"
42:02;42:04;"you know, wrestling-style rivalry"
42:04;42:07;"and yet, based on everything I've ever heard"
42:07;42:09;"it's not. At all."
42:09;42:11;"Because, obviously"
42:11;42:13;"these two dudes"
42:13;42:16;"they're leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table"
42:16;42:19;"by not having Oasis exist for a decade"
42:19;42:20;"I don't know any details or something"
42:20;42:23;"and I've met people who know some of them"
42:23;42:25;"it's definitely real"
42:25;42:26;"and yet, I still sometimes get this vibe"
42:26;42:27;"where I'm just, like"
42:27;42:29;"even the way they talk s*** about each other"
42:29;42:32;"in the press seems kind of playful"
42:32;42:34;"there's something confusing about it to me"
42:34;42:35;"but clearly, it's not a bit"
42:35;42:37;"I bet it'll happen, though"
42:37;42:40;"like, Coachella in, like, eight years"
42:40;42:42;"or two years, or whatever"
42:42;42:44;"something will bring them back together"
42:44;42:46;"I don't think so"
42:46;42:47;"never?"
42:47;42:49;"I mean, I think that they"
42:49;42:51;"really, really hate each other"
42:51;42:53;"I mean, I'm not in a band"
42:53;42:55;"but I know that, and we've heard"
42:55;42:57;"there's obviously, like, deep-seated things"
42:57;42:59;"of ego, right?"
42:59;43:00;"of, like, publishing"
43:00;43:01;"of who's writing"
43:01;43:02;"of performing"
43:02;43:03;"all these things we know"
43:03;43:04;"and those are very real"
43:04;43:06;"and those seem surmountable"
43:06;43:09;"like, money tends, in the economics"
43:09;43:11;"surmount that with every one of these reunions"
43:11;43:15;"but you put the brother/family stuff in there"
43:15;43:19;"and it feels so heightened"
43:19;43:20;"that it just does"
43:20;43:22;"it feels like, yeah, it became, like"
43:22;43:23;"a funny thing for everyone"
43:23;43:26;"but they do genuinely seem to hate each other"
43:26;43:29;"and I do think it's, like"
43:29;43:30;"it's beyond ego"
43:30;43:31;"and it's beyond the money"
43:31;43:33;"and it feels like it's so personal"
43:33;43:36;"and I think that's what makes it feel so enjoyable, also"
43:36;43:38;"but, um, yeah, I don't know"
43:38;43:39;"are the Black Crows getting together?"
43:39;43:40;"I've heard him talk about it"
43:40;43:42;"Black Crows were about to do a reunion tour"
43:42;43:43;"oh, yeah"
43:43;43:47;"they were starting to advertise it, I think, pre-COVID"
43:47;43:48;"so I don't know if it ever happened"
43:48;43:49;"I remember that"
43:49;43:50;"and I remember specifically"
43:50;43:52;"that in the promotional materials"
43:52;43:54;"they made it clear"
43:54;43:56;"there will be no jamming"
43:56;43:57;"wait, really?"
43:57;43:58;"yeah, yeah, I remember in the Black"
43:58;44:00;"there was, like, articles that were just, like"
44:00;44:02;"only the hits, no jamming"
44:02;44:04;"and I wonder if it's because, like"
44:04;44:07;"Chris had been out there, you know, jamming with Phil"
44:07;44:09;"and doing his Chris Robinson brotherhood"
44:09;44:11;"and getting, like, real crunchy and funky"
44:11;44:14;"and that, like, the old school Black Crows fans were just, like"
44:14;44:16;"I'm only buying a ticket"
44:16;44:18;"if both Robinsons are on stage"
44:18;44:19;"and I can be assured"
44:19;44:21;"that there will be no jamming"
44:21;44:23;"that'd be funny, like, a class action lawsuit"
44:23;44:25;"against the Black Crows"
44:25;44:27;"because they, like, vamped"
44:27;44:29;"a little too long on one song"
44:29;44:30;"and there's, like, a judge"
44:30;44:31;"your version of Remedy"
44:31;44:33;"was 9 minutes and 30 seconds"
44:33;44:35;"or just, like"
44:35;44:37;"that version of Remedy clocked in at"
44:37;44:39;"5.50"
44:39;44:41;"and there's, like, a judge somewhere who just has to be, like"
44:41;44:44;"I don't think that that counts as jamming"
44:44;44:45;"and just, like, a lawyer"
44:45;44:47;"just desperately trying to, like, prove"
44:47;44:49;"compared to the studio version"
44:49;44:50;"that was a jam"
44:50;44:52;"you have expert witness"
44:52;44:55;"Matt did just send me"
44:55;44:57;"that last week"
44:57;44:59;"Noel tweeted something"
44:59;45:01;"to the effect of that show you were talking about, Ezra"
45:01;45:03;"that he wished that he would've played that"
45:03;45:05;"it would've, quote, been a mad gig"
45:05;45:07;"which has sparked"
45:07;45:09;"reunion speculation"
45:09;45:11;"the one where he never ended up playing and they broke up"
45:11;45:13;"oh, oh, oh, that one"
45:13;45:14;"would've been a mad gig"
45:14;45:15;"which has sparked it"
45:15;45:16;"now, I will say"
45:16;45:17;"I still"
45:17;45:18;"have money on"
45:18;45:20;"that it will never happen"
45:20;45:22;"because, as you know"
45:22;45:24;"you don't just reunite"
45:24;45:26;"you have to practice, you have to rehearse"
45:26;45:28;"you have to jam"
45:28;45:29;"and it won't make it past that"
45:29;45:31;"wouldn't it be cool if they did, like, a tour called, like"
45:31;45:33;"the Don't Look Back in Anger tour"
45:33;45:35;"and they did, like, um"
45:35;45:37;"what was that Metallica documentary where they had, like, a therapist"
45:37;45:39;"I had the same thoughts, Seinfeld"
45:39;45:41;"right, and it's, like, a real British"
45:41;45:43;"like, a British psychologist is like"
45:43;45:44;"""Oi, like, put a beat"""
45:44;45:46;"like, I'm not gonna do the accent, but, like"
45:46;45:48;"you know, like a nice, that would be, like, an interstitial"
45:48;45:49;"right, right"
45:49;45:51;"yeah, like, do a whole"
45:51;45:52;"that would be huge"
45:52;45:54;"if you could get the two brothers"
45:54;45:56;"to sit down with, like, some"
45:56;45:58;"celebrity psychologist for, like, a five-part"
45:58;45:59;"series"
45:59;46:00;"Oprah!"
46:00;46:02;"with Oprah, it would draw more viewers than the Meghan"
46:02;46:03;"Markle interview"
46:03;46:04;"at least in the UK"
46:04;46:05;"it would show, absolutely"
46:05;46:07;"wait, by the way, I meant to"
46:07;46:09;"say this earlier, speaking of English TV"
46:09;46:11;"Nick, who's a TV producer"
46:11;46:13;"among other things, has a"
46:13;46:15;"a show on the BBC"
46:15;46:16;"right now"
46:16;46:18;"can we talk about this, Nick?"
46:18;46:19;"it's a wild show"
46:19;46:21;"it's made a big impression on me"
46:21;46:23;"I think about it all the time"
46:23;46:25;"so do I, dude"
46:25;46:26;"also, because"
46:26;46:28;"what's up with this show?"
46:28;46:29;"it's called ""This is My House"""
46:29;46:31;"and the theme song to it"
46:31;46:33;"is the amazing Flo Rida song"
46:33;46:35;"""Welcome to my house"""
46:35;46:37;"and you guys use it over and over again"
46:37;46:38;"in the show"
46:38;46:39;"and all the different parts"
46:39;46:41;"""Welcome to my house"""
46:41;46:42;"I've had it stuck in my head"
46:42;46:43;"""This is my house"""
46:43;46:44;"what?"
46:44;46:45;"oh yeah"
46:45;46:46;"""This is my house"""
46:46;46:47;"""It's my house, come on!"""
46:47;46:48;"yeah, the sting"
46:48;46:49;"""This is my house, come on"""
46:50;46:52;"so I think about that song all the time"
46:52;46:54;"every time I step into my house"
46:54;46:56;"I softly say to myself"
46:56;46:57;"""Welcome to my house"""
46:57;46:59;"I go to somebody else's house"
46:59;47:01;"I think ""Welcome to their house"""
47:01;47:03;"just truly an amazing song"
47:03;47:05;"just throw that song on for a second"
47:05;47:06;"then we'll hear about the show"
47:06;47:08;"I mean, it's an amazing song"
47:08;47:10;"it kind of changed the whole"
47:10;47:13;"tenor of the idea"
47:13;47:14;"when someone mentioned me"
47:14;47:16;"I was talking to him about this"
47:16;47:17;"and he goes"
47:17;47:19;"""Are you using the Flo Rida song"
47:19;47:20;"as the theme song?"""
47:20;47:27;"""Open up the champagne, pop!"""
47:27;47:29;"""It's my house, come on!"""
47:29;47:30;"""Turn it up!"""

50:24;50:27;"all claim to be the same person"
50:27;50:29;"and claim that it's their house."
50:29;50:31;"So there's, let's say it's you,"
50:31;50:34;"there's four people saying they're Ezra Koenig"
50:34;50:36;"and we shoot them in their house"
50:36;50:39;"and they all live in, for 24 hours,"
50:39;50:41;"live in a house and walk around the house"
50:41;50:43;"talking about their house."
50:43;50:46;"But only one of them is really the owner of the house"
50:46;50:48;"and the other three are actors"
50:48;50:51;"all pretending to be that person"
50:51;50:53;"and making up their own stories about stuff."""
50:53;50:55;"""Right, and somebody's guiding them through the house"
50:55;50:57;"and meanwhile a panel of celebrities"
50:57;50:59;"are watching this go down, and,"
50:59;51:01;"just to give people an example"
51:01;51:03;"of like, how does this look in practice."
51:03;51:04;"So you have four different people saying,"
51:04;51:05;"'Yeah, welcome to my house, this is my house.'"
51:05;51:08;"And then the host might walk over to a"
51:08;51:11;"piece of furniture, like a couch, and say,"
51:11;51:13;"'Any funny stories about this couch?'"
51:13;51:16;"And then one person say, 'Yeah, as a matter of fact,"
51:16;51:18;"my husband didn't want me to buy it, whatever.'"
51:18;51:20;"And then somebody else is looking at them being like,"
51:20;51:22;"'Oh my, you're just making this up."
51:22;51:23;"Here's the story with this couch."
51:23;51:25;"We actually inherited it from my mother-in-law.'"
51:25;51:27;"And somebody's like, 'Oh, oh my God,"
51:27;51:29;"it's so weird hearing you lie about my couch."
51:29;51:31;"Here's the story with the couch.'"
51:31;51:32;"Actually, I've had it for years,"
51:32;51:34;"before we got together."
51:34;51:36;"It's like a series of things like that."
51:36;51:38;"And the people get very competitive with each other,"
51:38;51:40;"kind of just looking at each other,"
51:40;51:41;"being like, 'Oh, why are you saying that"
51:41;51:43;"about my husband? It's so weird.'"
51:43;51:46;"And some people are better actors than others,"
51:46;51:48;"and one person obviously is the real person,"
51:48;51:50;"but they're all kind of one-upping each other"
51:50;51:53;"to be like, 'Uh, that's the stupidest thing"
51:53;51:55;"I ever heard. This is my house,"
51:55;51:57;"and the reason that we have that painting"
51:57;51:59;"is, you know, that kind of sh*t.'"
51:59;52:00;"The truth is that when you start getting"
52:00;52:02;"very specific about your stuff,"
52:02;52:06;"and sometimes the crazier the story sounds,"
52:06;52:08;"and the more passionate you are about it,"
52:08;52:10;"the more it seems like you're lying."
52:10;52:13;"And so, yeah, they sort of argue over things"
52:13;52:16;"like their couch, or, you know,"
52:16;52:17;"the clothes in their closet."
52:17;52:20;"They usually bring out their girlfriend"
52:20;52:22;"or boyfriend or, you know, their spouse"
52:22;52:24;"or partner, and that person sits there"
52:24;52:27;"while they all recount their wedding story"
52:27;52:29;"to him or her."
52:29;52:31;"And it's, I mean, it's psychotic."
52:31;52:32;"I mean, the show is really, like,"
52:32;52:33;"when you talk about, yeah, you'll get"
52:33;52:35;"five minutes of hearing people talk"
52:35;52:37;"about their couch, it sounds,"
52:37;52:40;"it's really stupid, and they get in real fights."
52:40;52:44;"And then a group of celebrities watch it,"
52:44;52:46;"and they have to try to deduce"
52:46;52:49;"who the owner of the house is."
52:49;52:52;"And, like I said, it was sort of a joke,"
52:52;52:55;"and then it became real,"
52:55;52:58;"and then someone suggested this Flo Rida song,"
52:58;53:00;"and so then we've got the Flo Rida song,"
53:00;53:02;"so we're like, we gotta use this at every moment."
53:02;53:05;"So it is, like, also in the sort of, yeah,"
53:05;53:07;"kind of, like, insane nature of the show,"
53:07;53:09;"Flo Rida's voice just keeps popping in"
53:09;53:10;"and going, ""That's my house."""
53:10;53:14;"I mean, it's really, it's insane."
53:14;53:15;"- Like back from commercial,"
53:15;53:17;"""Welcome to my house."""
53:17;53:18;"- Yeah, and then there's an elimination,"
53:18;53:20;"so then about two-thirds of the way in,"
53:20;53:23;"the real owner of the house tells the producer"
53:23;53:27;"who they think might be their biggest competition,"
53:27;53:29;"and that person's removed,"
53:29;53:31;"so you have three left,"
53:31;53:34;"and then those three go to meet the celebrities,"
53:34;53:36;"where the celebrities get to ask them questions,"
53:36;53:39;"and they have to pick if it's the owner of the house."
53:39;53:41;"And so, like, the dumb premise is"
53:41;53:44;"there's never been an easier game show to win,"
53:44;53:46;"you just have to tell the truth."
53:46;53:48;"But nothing feels believable."
53:48;53:50;"There's an end of times element to it."
53:50;53:52;"I mean, I'm interested in what you guys"
53:52;53:54;"would have to say about it,"
53:54;53:56;"and to the, you know, Matt Seinfeld,"
53:56;53:58;"I'll send you some copies,"
53:58;53:59;"'cause unless you have a VPN,"
53:59;54:02;"it's on Wednesday nights,"
54:02;54:05;"like at nine, and yeah, on BBC One."
54:05;54:08;"- Are the people improvising their lies about the house,"
54:08;54:09;"or do they have prep time?"
54:09;54:10;"Do they come up with their stories in advance?"
54:10;54:13;"- They have, like, 24 hours before"
54:13;54:15;"where they've walked through the house,"
54:15;54:18;"'cause, yeah, if you were to, like, open a drawer,"
54:18;54:20;"and, like, not know where, like, the cutlery is,"
54:20;54:21;"or something, like, then it would be too obvious."
54:21;54:23;"So people get to, like,"
54:23;54:25;"it's basically three people sabotaging someone"
54:25;54:27;"in their truth, you know?"
54:27;54:29;"- Right, and they get a heads up about"
54:29;54:31;"to start making up little stories in their head"
54:31;54:33;"so that they're not totally on the spot."
54:33;54:36;"- Right, and, you know, I, and as you guys know,"
54:36;54:39;"I just need to say it for anyone, you know, listening."
54:39;54:40;"Like, this is also not,"
54:40;54:42;"what I don't normally make shows on like this."
54:42;54:44;"I'd like to make more,"
54:44;54:46;"but it is about the silliest and stupidest thing"
54:46;54:47;"that I've ever made."
54:47;54:51;"- It has, like, the tone, it's very unique,"
54:51;54:53;"but it's familiar in terms of, like,"
54:53;54:57;"British reality show game show vibes."
54:57;54:58;"- Yeah."
54:58;54:59;"- Like, if you're looking for some of Nick's"
54:59;55:01;"adult swim background,"
55:01;55:04;"well, you could probably, in a really deep way,"
55:04;55:06;"you could probably make a connection."
55:06;55:09;"And also, to be 9 p.m. on Wednesday"
55:09;55:12;"on BBC One, or Channel One,"
55:12;55:15;"or whatever, BBC whatever, in the UK,"
55:15;55:16;"that's like the equivalent of, like,"
55:16;55:19;"some must-see TV s***, right, in the U.S.?"
55:19;55:20;"- Yeah."
55:20;55:22;"- That's like an American Idol type slot, right?"
55:22;55:24;"- Yeah, they moved it up."
55:24;55:27;"It was actually commissioned for BBC Two,"
55:27;55:28;"which I think at the lower,"
55:28;55:30;"not lower, but the more you go down,"
55:30;55:31;"I don't know the British system that well,"
55:31;55:32;"but they sort of,"
55:32;55:34;"that's the cooler, sort of, smaller one."
55:34;55:37;"I think BBC Two may be where the office started"
55:37;55:39;"and then sort of graduates."
55:39;55:40;"- Right."
55:40;55:42;"- They saw this and they moved it to BBC One."
55:42;55:44;"- Is this like a big hit in the UK?"
55:44;55:46;"- It appears to me that it is."
55:46;55:48;"You know, I'm not there and I can't watch it,"
55:48;55:50;"but everyone seems very, very happy about it,"
55:50;55:53;"and it's always, like, one of the number one trending topics."
55:53;55:55;"Like, it's also, like, young."
55:55;55:57;"I mean, it feels weird."
55:57;55:59;"I think there is a sort of, it's,"
55:59;56:02;"right now, like, people want something"
56:02;56:05;"that may not test them"
56:05;56:07;"and just is sort of enjoyable,"
56:07;56:11;"but also has some sort of very smart undercurrent."
56:11;56:14;"Like, I do think that it's just bizarre enough,"
56:14;56:16;"and I think, and it is smart enough"
56:16;56:19;"that you could, like, write why it's not stupid."
56:19;56:22;"- Do you think you've tapped into the zeitgeist in some way?"
56:22;56:25;"Like, we've spent a year all homebound, you know,"
56:25;56:28;"getting acquainted with our houses,"
56:28;56:30;"the various ins and outs,"
56:30;56:32;"developing a stronger relationship."
56:32;56:34;"Now here comes, this is my house,"
56:34;56:36;"and it sort of becomes a fulfillment of--"
56:36;56:40;"- Yeah, I definitely think that this idea was before then,"
56:40;56:43;"but that it has benefited from quarantine"
56:43;56:44;"for a lot of reasons,"
56:44;56:46;"and one of them definitely is that."
56:46;56:48;"I think that people are at home."
56:48;56:50;"They're used to being really at home,"
56:50;56:53;"but they're also not out at their friends' houses"
56:53;56:55;"or their family's houses as much,"
56:55;56:56;"and they're looking at this,"
56:56;56:59;"and they're able to actually sort of"
56:59;57:01;"have that sort of enjoyment, I think."
57:01;57:05;"And I don't know, I saw some review today"
57:05;57:09;"that was like, they got quarantine TV right,"
57:09;57:11;"'cause I do think that so many people"
57:11;57:13;"tried to make things, like, quote, ""in quarantine,"""
57:13;57:14;"and they were just like,"
57:14;57:16;"""We're gonna do whole shows with people on Zooms"
57:16;57:17;"and FaceTiming,"""
57:17;57:19;"and you're like, you can actually do something"
57:19;57:20;"that's not like that,"
57:20;57:23;"that captures a lot of the feelings"
57:23;57:24;"that we may be having,"
57:24;57:28;"and some of the ambitions that we may have,"
57:28;57:30;"but is not just being like,"
57:30;57:32;"""Oh yeah, we're doing a whole show with people on Zoom."""
57:32;57:35;"- Yeah, 'cause you spend your day on Zoom calls."
57:35;57:37;"You don't wanna like chill out"
57:37;57:39;"on another Zoom call passively."
57:39;57:42;"- It sends a positive message to people."
57:42;57:44;"Actually, it makes you also wonder why"
57:44;57:47;"""My House"" by Flo Rida wasn't a quarantine anthem"
57:47;57:48;"from the start,"
57:48;57:52;"a kind of celebration of just, you know,"
57:52;57:54;"whether you rent, buy,"
57:54;57:56;"have a room in somebody else's house,"
57:56;57:58;"living in somebody's basement,"
57:58;58:00;"that's still your space, it's still your house."
58:00;58:02;"You can't really appreciate your house"
58:02;58:04;"until you have three imposters"
58:04;58:06;"walking around saying it's theirs."
58:06;58:07;"And then suddenly, you know,"
58:07;58:09;"you start getting a little territorial."
58:09;58:10;"You know what, I didn't like this place that much,"
58:10;58:12;"but you know what, this is my house."
58:12;58:14;"- Welcome to my house."
58:14;58:16;"- You know, it's funny you said this thing."
58:16;58:18;"I've listened to this Flo Rida song"
58:18;58:20;"a thousand times at this point."
58:20;58:24;"And maybe it's 'cause I'm listening to it"
58:24;58:26;"through the lens of the show."
58:26;58:28;"But it's funny when you're like,"
58:28;58:29;"""Oh, it's about having a girl over."""
58:29;58:31;"And obviously now I'm really listening to the lyrics,"
58:31;58:32;"I'm like, ""Yeah."""
58:32;58:33;"But I definitely was,"
58:33;58:36;"even if you have someone over to your house"
58:36;58:39;"for, you know, late night relations,"
58:39;58:42;"the idea that it's about the pride of your house."
58:42;58:43;"I always sort of was like,"
58:43;58:44;"""Oh, it's about a guy having a party."""
58:44;58:45;"Or you can always say like,"
58:45;58:47;"""This is a song written about when he bought his new house,"
58:47;58:49;"he's having a housewarming party."""
58:49;58:50;"Like there's a weird thing,"
58:50;58:51;"it's like if you have someone over to your house,"
58:51;58:53;"you can be like, ""Hey, welcome to my house."""
58:53;58:55;"This is, you know, there's one song"
58:55;58:56;"and you might want to throw this on."
58:56;58:59;"'Cause I found the pride of the house like so,"
58:59;59:01;"you're right, it's so lovely."
59:01;59:02;"And you're like, ""Yeah, I should,"
59:02;59:04;"no matter where I live, it's my house."
59:04;59:06;"It's my stuff, I should take pride in it."""
59:06;59:07;"There was a moment where we didn't think"
59:07;59:10;"we could get the song and we got pretty nervous"
59:10;59:13;"because I was like, I had put so much stake on this song,"
59:13;59:15;"like the comedy of the show."
59:15;59:16;"We found one other song,"
59:16;59:18;"which is Diana Ross's song, ""My House."""
59:18;59:19;"When I was looking for songs about my house,"
59:19;59:20;"I don't know if you know,"
59:20;59:22;"but this is another one, which is,"
59:22;59:24;"it doesn't have the energy to be the theme,"
59:24;59:28;"but tonally and the lyrics made me laugh so hard."
59:28;59:29;"If you want to put it on."
59:29;59:31;"- I'm not familiar with this Diana Ross song."
59:31;59:33;"- I wasn't familiar with it either,"
59:33;59:34;"but it's got a really cool,"
59:34;59:35;"it's a very cool vibe."
59:38;59:44;"- Very vibey."
59:44;59:49;"♪ It's my house and I live here ♪"
59:54;59:55;"- Okay."
59:55;59:59;"♪ There's a welcome mat at the door ♪"
59:59;01:00:04;"♪ And if you come on in, you're gonna get much more ♪"
01:00:04;01:00:09;"♪ There's my chair, I put it there ♪"
01:00:09;01:00:14;"♪ Everything you see is with love and care ♪"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"♪ It's my house and I live here ♪"
01:00:18;01:00:23;"♪ I want to tell ya, it's my house and I live here ♪"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- I love this idea of having pride."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- This would have been cool too."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"- It would have been very cool."
01:00:27;01:00:28;"And I think we'll probably use it"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"maybe as like a closing theme, if we haven't already."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"But like, there was just something"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"about the energy of the Flo Rida song,"
01:00:35;01:00:39;"but I love this feeling of having pride in your stuff."
01:00:39;01:00:41;"That's my chair and I put it there."
01:00:41;01:00:47;"- Did you ever consider ""Our House"" by Madness?"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"- Yeah."
01:00:48;01:00:49;"- Great song."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"- I feel like that's sort of been used a lot,"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"but I, you know, but yeah, I went,"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"I have a whole playlist of just songs about people's homes."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"- Well, and also that's ""Our House."""
01:00:57;01:00:59;"- Yeah, and it's ""Our House"" and this is ""My House."""
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- Mm-hmm."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"- You know, but there is, yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- I love ""Our House."""
01:01:03;01:01:05;"- Oh yeah, Matt just said, ""Burning down the house."""
01:01:05;01:01:06;"- No, but it's funny."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"- That's when they cancel us."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"- Well, and maybe this is a good transition."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"We don't have to go too deep."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"We've really been flying by the seat of our pants"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"on this episode."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"I didn't think we were going to be doing"
01:01:14;01:01:15;"an Oasis Flo Rida episode."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"Although in the back of my head,"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"I did want to talk about the show."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"But listening to those lyrics"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"made me think about talking heads"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"because there's actually something very like,"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"I was thinking about David Byrne's lyrics today"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"because we found a picture."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"It was posted by the Grateful Dead fan,"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"Jamban, the Instagram account, lot.com."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"And they found a picture I'd never seen before"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"of David Byrne and Bob Weir wearing headphones,"
01:01:43;01:01:47;"sitting next to each other in 1986."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"And actually I had a funny comment from Jack Wagner"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"of Yeah, But Still Pod,"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"who said like, ""This is the first podcast."""
01:01:55;01:01:56;"And if you look at it,"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"it totally looks like they're doing,"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"you see like two dudes with headphones next to each other,"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"just like podcast vibe."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"But this was 1986,"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"so they were probably just doing a radio interview."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"But basically it turned out David Byrne"
01:02:07;01:02:10;"watched a Grateful Dead show in Berkeley"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"at the Greek Theater in 1986."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"And he was there,"
01:02:14;01:02:16;"it's unclear exactly what he was doing there,"
01:02:16;01:02:21;"but clearly he had some sort of chat with Bob Weir."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"And there's like a journalist there"
01:02:23;01:02:27;"who asked about if the Talking Heads"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"could be the Grateful Dead of the '80s,"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"which maybe was something people were saying in 1986."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Talking Heads, you know, kind of legendary live band."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Maybe there was some feeling,"
01:02:36;01:02:39;"could the Talking Heads, such a different band,"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"but could they maybe be handed the torch?"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"And this journalist, David Ganz, asked Bob Weir,"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"""What do you think about that?"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"""Could Talking Heads be the Grateful Dead of the '80s?"""
01:02:47;01:02:50;"And Weir's response was, ""God help them."""
01:02:50;01:02:52;"But anyway, the reason I started thinking"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"of Talking Heads just now is,"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"I started going through the Talking Heads discography"
01:02:57;01:03:00;"and I asked the rest of the TC crew to do the same"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"to see what connections we could find."
01:03:02;01:03:06;"Like, what's the most dead-ish Heads song?"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"What's the most Heads-ish Dead song?"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Dead Heads, that'd be the name for the cover band"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"that only does Grateful Dead and Talking Heads song."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"But listening to David Byrne's lyrics,"
01:03:17;01:03:20;"he did invent this style, which is like the,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"I don't know how to describe it."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"I associate it a lot with cool, weird,"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"downtown New York, early punk rock, new wave,"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"but that vibe of just kind of being like,"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"""Let me just describe some regular (beep)."""
01:03:33;01:03:36;"This kind of eerie '70s vibe of just kind of"
01:03:36;01:03:40;"describing modern life with very little commentary,"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"which in and of itself has its own commentary."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"- More songs about buildings and food."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- Yeah, exactly, more songs about buildings and food."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"And you could totally picture,"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"in one of the first three Talking Heads records,"
01:03:51;01:03:55;"a song that's like, ""It's my house, and I live here."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"""That chair, I put it there."""
01:03:57;01:03:58;"You know what I mean?"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"It really has a college art rock vibe."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"""That chair, I put it there."""
01:04:04;01:04:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"And obviously, Talking Heads do have,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"""This is not my beautiful house."""
01:04:09;01:04:12;"That could have been another option for the show."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"But there's something about that type of lyric,"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"just like, if not Talking Heads,"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"but somebody else from that era,"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"like Richard Hell or television or something,"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"just like, ""It's my house, and I live here."""
01:04:22;01:04:25;"I even just picture picking up some punk single"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"that had the lyrics on it,"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"and you don't even know what the band is,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"and you're like, ""What is this, 1978?"""
01:04:30;01:04:31;"And you just read the lyrics on the back,"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"""It's my house, and I live here."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"""That chair, I put it there."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"""It's my house, and I live here."""
01:04:36;01:04:37;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"It just sounds like weird punk rock."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"It could also be some LA hardcore,"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"like some weird Black Flag song."
01:04:44;01:04:45;"""It's my house, and I live here."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"""That chair, I put it there."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"""That chair, I put it there."""
01:04:49;01:04:51;"So maybe Diana, that sounds like some late '70s."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Maybe Diana was feeling that kind of,"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"there's something in the air."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"She's feeling that punk rock spirit."
01:04:55;01:04:58;"But anyway, that was my awkward transition"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"from Diana Ross to Talking Heads."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"- Not awkward."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"- Thank you, I appreciate that, Jake."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- Masterful."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- Thank you."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"Thinking about this moment when, you know,"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"David Byrne's watching Bob Weir,"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"and we were already texting about it"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"on the TC Text thread,"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"just like pulling up the set list"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"at the Greek Theater."
01:05:16;01:05:20;"Jack Straw opener, Box of Rain closer."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I think I told you guys that I was playing it"
01:05:22;01:05:23;"in my household."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"There's a little bit of, like,"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"what are you listening to?"
01:05:27;01:05:29;"It's not the strongest Box of Rain performance."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"- A little bit of domestic tension."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"- A little bit of domestic tension,"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"busting out that--"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"- Music choice."
01:05:34;01:05:37;"- That 622-86 Box of Rain."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"I had to explain, ""Babe, this is a great song."""
01:05:40;01:05:41;"- I'm working."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"- Hey, I'm working."
01:05:43;01:05:44;"- I'm prepping for the show."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"- ""Babe, this is a great song."""
01:05:46;01:05:47;"It's one of Jake's all-time faves."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"Is that fair to say, Jake,"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Box of Rain's one of your favorite dead songs?"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"- Yeah, I'd put that top 10."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"- It's just not, you know,"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"it's not like a classic live song."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"- I would never, like, seek out"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"a live version of Box of Rain."
01:05:58;01:06:00;"- But still, a great song nonetheless."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"That's one you-- - Beautiful song."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"- You want to start with the studio recording, for sure."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- Yeah, for sure."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"- But anyway, we're just kind of picturing"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"David Byrne, like, taking in the show."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Our big question, you know,"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"looking at, like, this is what's in, like, set one."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Jack Straw, ""Must Have Been the Roses."""
01:06:13;01:06:15;"Beautiful song, especially when Jake sings it."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"- Nice."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"- Cassidy, ""Row, Jimmy, Row,"""
01:06:18;01:06:20;"New Minglewood Blues, Big Railroad Blues."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Good set list."

01:06:27;01:06:29;"""Man Smart, Woman Smarter."""
01:06:29;01:06:30;"- Ouch."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"That's a very strong set, with a few exceptions."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"- Drums, ""Space,"" ""Outta Space,"" ""Truckin',"""
01:06:36;01:06:38;"""Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad,"" ""Stella Blue,"""
01:06:38;01:06:39;"""Turn on Your Love Light."""
01:06:39;01:06:41;"I mean, you probably know that, it's a cover."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"U.S. Blues, ""Box of Rain."""
01:06:42;01:06:43;"We're just kind of wondering, like,"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"how tapped in would David Byrne have been?"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"'Cause you could totally picture him just being like,"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"knowing about the Grateful Dead,"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"maybe being kind of fascinated by, like,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"the cultural element, but, like,"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"maybe not knowing 99% of these songs."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"- So he was born in '52."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- Mm-hmm."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"- In '72, he's 20."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Hard to know what his scene,"
01:07:05;01:07:09;"so he's 25 or 24 when he started talking heads,"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"or probably earlier, but, like, yeah, hard to know."
01:07:12;01:07:14;"We were texting, like, maybe he had an older brother"
01:07:14;01:07:18;"that was kind of a hippie that was, like, in on the dead."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"'Cause, like, you gotta figure early '70s,"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"David Byrne's into, like,"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"go full circle here, Lou Reed."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"- You would think."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- Can I just call out that TomTom Club"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"opened for Grateful Dead in 1988,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"for whatever that's worth?"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"- Well, yeah, and then--"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"- Tight."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"- No, that's a good call, 'cause it seems like"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Chris Franz, the drummer of Talking Heads,"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"who started TomTom Club with Tina Weymouth, his wife,"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"they had a whole connection"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"where they opened for the dead,"
01:07:43;01:07:46;"and then they would hang out a lot with Bob."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"They hung out when they played The Garden,"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"and seemed like they were, like,"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"checking in on each other."
01:07:52;01:07:54;"He said Bob came down to see TomTom Club"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"when they did a five-night run at CBGB's."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"So maybe there is some kind of, like,"
01:07:59;01:08:02;"deep interplay happening between the two bands,"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"but that doesn't necessarily mean that"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Burne was that tapped in."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"And, yeah, you could also picture"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"Burne having very little context for them,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"and this is just, like, the first time"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"he's taking it all in, it's, like, 1986 in Berkeley."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"But he sat down and did an interview with Bob"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"where we gotta see if we can find"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"the audio of that somewhere."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"But it made me think a bunch about, like,"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"the connections between the bands,"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"'cause obviously, maybe the loosest connection"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"is that they're both kind of, like,"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"two legendary live bands,"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"and in very different ways, you know."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Grateful Dead, Improvisatory,"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"Jerry Garcia's solos, Talking Heads,"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"just, like, the kind of, like,"
01:08:39;01:08:42;"perfection of Remain in Light,"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"which, by the way, I'm not trying to be a hater,"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"but it has a lot of overdubs."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"You know, they wanted to be perfect."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"When you watch the movie--"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"- Like Europe '72."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- Well, yeah, and like Europe '72."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"That's true."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"So the talking--"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"Grateful Dead could relate."
01:08:55;01:08:57;"In their early days, they strived"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"for a type of perfection."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I think they probably loosened up a bit."
01:09:00;01:09:03;"- And I think the early Dick Picks releases in the '90s,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"the Dead were very, like, uptight"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"and controlling about, like,"
01:09:08;01:09:11;"which songs made it on those releases,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"and they loosened up over time,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"but, like, the early Dick Picks collections"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"were not just, like, straight-up shows."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"- Right."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"- They were sort of, like, greatest hits compilations"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"from, like, you know, two shows, three shows."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"- That's actually interesting."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"I guess I vaguely knew that,"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"but it's funny because"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"you picture the culture of Deadheads"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"trading tapes and having access"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"in their network of tape traders"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"to just about every show,"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"so you feel like, of course,"
01:09:38;01:09:39;"that's part of the culture,"
01:09:39;01:09:42;"but that doesn't mean that the band was in on it,"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"and you could imagine somebody's like,"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"""Guys, you should start doing more official live releases."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"""You have so much great stuff in the archives,"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"""and people trade this [bleep] all the time,"""
01:09:51;01:09:53;"and, you know, maybe them listening back to a show"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"and just being like,"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"""Oh, God, you're telling me that there's, like,"
01:09:57;01:10:00;"""a dorm room full of, like, stoners"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"""at, like, Andover jamming this?"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"""Jesus Christ."
01:10:04;01:10:07;"""Can somebody sneak in there and, like, delete all the tapes?"""
01:10:07;01:10:08;"Like, no."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"They didn't realize how deeply people were, like,"
01:10:10;01:10:13;"interacting with the recorded live material,"
01:10:13;01:10:15;"or they didn't want to think about it,"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"and then suddenly they're like,"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"""All right, let's make this official,"""
01:10:17;01:10:20;"and it's like, ""Oof, that was an off night,"""
01:10:20;01:10:21;"or something."
01:10:21;01:10:22;"- For sure."
01:10:22;01:10:25;"- Okay, so I was thinking a little bit about"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"what Grateful Dead and Talking Heads songs"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"have the most in common,"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"and it was a little random."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"Jake, did you come up with your own pairings?"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"Did you have any thoughts on it?"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"- Yeah, I did. - Okay, so maybe I'll start."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"This is, like, a weird one that came to mind,"
01:10:39;01:10:40;"and this is also why I was thinking about"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"that Diana Ross song and that specific"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"kind of slice-of-David-Byrne-type lyrics"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"that's just, like, describing modern life"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"with, like, very little commentary,"
01:10:50;01:10:54;"and this song has a weird touch"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"of, like, Grateful Dead to me,"
01:10:56;01:11:00;"and it's the last song on More Buildings and Food,"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"and it's called ""The Big Country."""

01:22:42;01:22:44;"in the opening, no one was really there yet,"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"including my brother."
01:22:45;01:22:47;"And I saw David Byrne roll up on his bicycle"

01:22:50;01:22:53;"on the Lower East Side and David Byrne rolled in."

01:22:55;01:22:56;"and two other people."
01:22:56;01:22:59;"And I had met David Byrne maybe in passing"
01:22:59;01:23:02;"for 10 seconds once with my brother a year ago."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"So he didn't remember me, but he was just going."

01:23:21;01:23:25;"It was just classic, awkward, early art opening."
01:23:25;01:23:30;"There's no, a very stilted social situation."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"And then he was there for a few minutes"

01:23:55;01:24:00;"And the last few verses, he references Pizza Hut, 7-Eleven,"

01:27:36;01:27:39;"I guess it's like one to flat seven."
01:27:39;01:27:42;"I think it's just like A and B."

01:27:53;01:27:57;"But it's B mixolydian because the A is the flat seven,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"so it makes you want to use the mixolydian."

01:28:05;01:28:07;"We play this for Richard Pictures,"

01:28:14;01:28:16;"Oh, yeah, that riff."
01:28:16;01:28:22;"But also, I guess I'm just saying it's a classic Dead mode."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"It's a jammy mode, mixolydian."

01:29:12;01:29:14;"Maybe we should speed it up a little bit,"

01:29:19;01:29:21;"It's not a mountain on fire, it's a house on fire."""
01:29:21;01:29:24;"And then that's how Burn Down the House was written."

01:29:27;01:29:29;"Yeah, when I picture fire on the mountain,"

01:29:30;01:29:34;"I'm interested in how the modern human condition interacts"

01:29:36;01:29:38;"Fire on the mountain's a very abstract image to me."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"It doesn't speak to me."
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Burning down the house."
01:29:41;01:29:44;"It's almost primordial."
01:29:44;01:29:47;"That's not going to fly with the Heads fans."
01:29:47;01:29:50;"Burnin' down, dun-dun, dun-dun."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"You know, I thought about it because, like,"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"the Vampire Weekend song, Sunflower,"
01:29:54;01:29:58;"has that same classic mixolydian chord progression."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"[sings]"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"What are the chords on that?"
01:30:01;01:30:05;"For the verse, it's just down a whole step, E flat to D flat."
01:30:05;01:30:11;"[sings]"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"I remember thinking, and you know,"
01:30:13;01:30:17;"the version we did live a lot on the Father the Bride tour"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"was basically our kind of like Black Sabbath version."
01:30:20;01:30:24;"Because it seemed too easy to go into just a full-on dead jam."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"We could have gotten a full Fire on the Mountain vibe."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"Sure."
01:30:27;01:30:31;"But we were like, let's try to do something a little more unexpected."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"So we did this hard rock."
01:30:32;01:30:35;"[sings]"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Yeah, it gets heavy."
01:30:36;01:30:38;"But there's times I was kind of jamming on it."
01:30:38;01:30:41;"I was like, oh, one day we could do a full Talking Heads version."
01:30:41;01:30:42;"It's like kind of,"
01:30:42;01:30:49;"[sings]"
01:30:49;01:30:53;"You know, you could go full Stop Making Sense vibe."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"Just do like the funk version."
01:30:54;01:30:59;"[sings]"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"You know, like, get some weird sense."
01:31:01;01:31:05;"You guys are playing that in E flat and D flat?"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"Yes."
01:31:06;01:31:07;"[laughs]"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"What difference does it make on guitar?"
01:31:09;01:31:12;"I mean, for me it would, but I'm not a very good guitar player."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"A good guitar player wouldn't make any difference."
01:31:14;01:31:18;"But I'm just used to working on the third, the fifth, the seventh frets."
01:31:18;01:31:22;"Like, you know, and like doing everything up a half step"
01:31:22;01:31:25;"or down a half step from that would just, I would mess up like crazy."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Obviously, Brian is a shredder."
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Well, yeah, and also obviously."
01:31:29;01:31:31;"It's just a funny key."
01:31:31;01:31:32;"Yeah, it is a funny key."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"I think about that sometimes because it's like,"
01:31:34;01:31:39;"I'm sure we got there just by trying to see like what felt like the best for singing."
01:31:39;01:31:42;"And like, White could have gone up a half step, down a half step,"
01:31:42;01:31:45;"but I'm not like ripping solos or anything."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"So I'm just playing like."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"You're working with pros, man."
01:31:47;01:31:50;"Like, oh, solo in D flat? No problem."
01:31:50;01:31:54;"I'd be like, oh, dude, are you serious? Can we just do this song in D?"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"Although you might be surprised, Jake, because I think like,"
01:31:57;01:32:00;"that's the thing about guitar. The shapes are the exact same."
01:32:00;01:32:03;"Oh, I get it. It just."
01:32:03;01:32:08;"Up above the seventh fret, I would just get, I would lose the plot."
01:32:08;01:32:12;"Yeah, it's nice when some of your little boxes and shapes line up"
01:32:12;01:32:16;"with the frets and the circles on the guitar."
01:32:16;01:32:18;"I feel that way, too. I know what you mean."
01:32:18;01:32:19;"I know what you mean."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"No, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not like a burner, like shredder,"
01:32:21;01:32:25;"the way Brian is or the dudes that I play with are."
01:32:25;01:32:30;"I think if I'm going to solo, it has to be in like E or G or D or A."
01:32:30;01:32:31;"It has to be."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"I can't solo in like G flat. It's not going to happen."
01:32:33;01:32:36;"Yeah, but it just in terms of playing chords, I feel like."
01:32:36;01:32:38;"Oh, sure. The chords. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"No, OK, I'm with you."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"All right. Well, should we get into the top five?"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"Absolutely."
01:32:43;01:32:50;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:32:50;01:32:54;"We got to get Jake home. Family man."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"There's a baby crying."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"There's a baby crying."
01:32:58;01:33:03;"There's a baby crying. Daddy's on the internet radio."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I don't know what voice that was."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"That was like a little Brandon Flowers."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"More like killers."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Yeah, those little killers meets."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"Oh, wait, can I just give a shout out to the killers?"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I have been loving the hot sauce."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"I've used two of the bottles."
01:33:18;01:33:21;"I'm down to the two hottest bottles that they gave us."
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Oh, damn."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Because they gave us four."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"And I'm a little worried."
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Because I got to."
01:33:27;01:33:28;"Maybe are you ready for it now?"
01:33:28;01:33:30;"I got to figure out the dosing."
01:33:30;01:33:31;"You've been working your way up."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Exactly."
01:33:33;01:33:38;"But I tore through the first two bottles on eggs and like pizza crust and whatever."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Just like loving it."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Shout out to the hot and their hot sauce."
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Nick, it was hot, but it was flavorful."
01:33:43;01:33:48;"And I'm worried about the last two becoming a little too hot and not flavorful enough."
01:33:48;01:33:49;"But we'll see."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"I'll report back."
01:33:50;01:33:51;"All right."
01:33:51;01:33:52;"Be careful."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"All right."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"So we're going to burn."
01:33:54;01:33:55;"Nineteen eighty six."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Why are we doing 1986?"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"It's the year."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Very obvious."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"David Byrne attended a grateful ditch."
01:34:03;01:34:08;"This is like maybe the most in the weeds quote reason for doing it."
01:34:08;01:34:17;"It's the year that David Byrne attended a dead show at the University of California at Berkeley."
01:34:17;01:34:26;"It was live broadcast on KPFA, which I love during a 14 hour dead a thon as a fundraiser for the station."
01:34:26;01:34:34;"And please, if anybody can help us, if you can find not the audio of the show that's easily accessible on archive."
01:34:34;01:34:43;"But the interview that Byrne and Bob Weir seem to have done together, maybe anybody has access to the KFPA archives."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"That'd be great to check out."
01:34:45;01:34:49;"OK, 1986, the number five song in excess."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"What you need."
01:34:51;01:34:54;"I still feel like I know very, very little about in excess."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Yeah, I haven't gone deep on this band."
01:34:56;01:34:59;"I mean, I know the need you tonight."
01:34:59;01:35:01;"A really big one."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"Yeah."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"I know the ballad, too."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Don't ask me."
01:35:05;01:35:28;"Hey, it's."
01:35:28;01:35:50;"When you got."
01:35:50;01:35:53;"So in excess, they're always like kind of funky."
01:35:53;01:35:56;"I'm definitely hearing like the Peter Gabriel connection."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"Yeah."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Some Robert Palmer."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Yeah."
01:36:00;01:36:04;"It's interesting to think about, like, yeah, what context did they emerge out?"
01:36:04;01:36:09;"Were they coming out of like broadly speaking punk?"
01:36:09;01:36:12;"Or were they just really into like Huey Lewis?"
01:36:12;01:36:14;"Or Prince."
01:36:14;01:36:16;"Oh, sure."
01:36:16;01:36:18;"Like 60s Motown."
01:36:18;01:36:21;"Definitely seem like an influence on the 1975."
01:36:21;01:36:22;"At least the funky parts."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"I mean, or maybe the 1975 just like."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Sure."
01:36:25;01:36:28;"We're interested in like 80s pop period."
01:36:28;01:36:30;"So this sounds like a big hit."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"Yeah, I mean, I think so."
01:36:32;01:36:35;"Not a huge fan of this band, I got to say."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"But OK, you know what?"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"We'll need to do a deep dive on in excess."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"I'm really just not like catching the vibe kind of."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"And they always seem cool."
01:36:44;01:36:49;"There's a ballad that they had called Never Tear Us Apart, which is incredible."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Very minimal."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"I will go deep."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"OK, let's move on to the number four song."
01:36:53;01:36:56;"Going to keep this moving."
01:36:56;01:36:59;"There's a baby crying at home."
01:36:59;01:37:03;"Daddy's on the internet radio."
01:37:03;01:37:04;"You doing Bruce here?"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"I'm doing some mix of Brandon Flowers and Bruce."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Yeah, I'll go full Bruce."
01:37:09;01:37:13;"Because there's a baby crying at home."
01:37:13;01:37:16;"And daddy's on the internet radio."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"Got to wrap up the top five."
01:37:17;01:37:20;"Mama's growing a little impatient."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Mama's just a little impatient."
01:37:22;01:37:26;"They did 45 minutes on Oasis."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"That's really good."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"And mama's just a little impatient."
01:37:29;01:37:32;"And did a 45 minutes on Oasis."
01:37:32;01:37:37;"He's on the internet radio."
01:37:37;01:37:43;"Speaking of Heartland Rock, the number four song this week in 1986,"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Jake's fave, John Mellencamp."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Do I know this song?"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"Do you know this song?"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"R-O-C-K in the USA."
01:37:50;01:37:53;"A salute to 60s rock."
01:37:53;01:37:54;"Oh, I know this."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"Terrible."
01:37:56;01:38:00;"R-O-C-K in the USA."
01:38:00;01:38:03;"Wait, is the parentheses, it says a salute to 60s rock?"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"Yes."
01:38:04;01:38:07;"That rules."
01:38:07;01:38:11;"I want to have a Mountain Bruce song where the parentheses is a salute to 60s rock."
01:38:21;01:38:25;"Come from the cities and they come from the smaller towns."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Oh, small towns?"
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Cool."
01:38:27;01:38:33;"Beat up cars with guitars and drummers go crack, boom, bam."
01:38:33;01:38:43;"R-O-C-K in the USA."
01:38:43;01:38:46;"Rocking in the USA."
01:38:46;01:38:50;"Rocking in the USA."
01:38:50;01:38:54;"Say goodbye to the family, say goodbye to the friends."
01:38:54;01:39:00;"Also, like, you know, Born in the USA was such a huge album that in 1986,"
01:39:00;01:39:05;"it still must have loomed so large that just like this like gritty,"
01:39:05;01:39:09;"intense song about like going to Vietnam, Born in the USA,"
01:39:09;01:39:13;"and then just like this song comes out in its wake."
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Very weak."
01:39:14;01:39:19;"I mean, dude, even like Brian Adams' song, Summer of '69,"
01:39:19;01:39:22;"which I think was probably like '84,"
01:39:22;01:39:27;"like that's a nostalgic sort of like throwback to like 60s rock"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"and like being a kid and playing in a band."
01:39:29;01:39:35;"That song is like a beautiful John Lennon ballad compared to this song."
01:39:35;01:39:39;"I mean, look, even Mellencamp has much better songs, Jack and Diane."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"Absolutely."
01:39:41;01:39:45;"Have you noticed on the internet the sucking on a chili dog meme?"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"More meme, yeah."
01:39:47;01:39:50;"I've seen more and more sucking on the chili dog memes,"
01:39:50;01:39:53;"and I've also seen what you were telling us,"
01:39:53;01:39:57;"that you've been getting tagged in all sorts of Forklift certification memes"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"since the last episode."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Yeah."
01:40:00;01:40:04;"Also that weird Grateful Dead Olive Garden t-shirt."
01:40:04;01:40:06;"That one's been around for a minute."
01:40:06;01:40:09;"Which is truly like a time crisis algorithm."
01:40:09;01:40:14;"The Olive Garden Grateful Dead steal your face logo like mashed together."
01:40:14;01:40:18;"It's like I should like it, but I don't."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"It's like a bridge too far."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"It's just too on the nose."
01:40:22;01:40:27;"I'd almost rather like a steal your face Forklift certification combo."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"That'd be better."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"Somehow that will materialize next week, I guarantee you."
01:40:32;01:40:33;"Definitely."
01:40:33;01:40:37;"And also Seinfeld looked up the Google trends for Forklift certification memes."
01:40:37;01:40:41;"It seems like they really peaked within the past year."
01:40:41;01:40:45;"So I wonder if it has something to do with COVID."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"Obviously they've existed for a while,"
01:40:48;01:40:53;"but it does feel like Forklift certification memes are kind of stronger than ever."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Yeah, I think it's a TikTok thing."
01:40:55;01:40:58;"I think TikTok had some sort of Forklift certified moment."
01:40:58;01:41:03;"I'm trying to like track down, but it's a little hard to put your finger on."
01:41:03;01:41:07;"F-O-R-K-L-I-F-T."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"All right, that doesn't roll off the tongue."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"I just want to see if there's like a real simple Forklift song."
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Forklift meme in the USA."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"It doesn't roll off the tongue."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Let's work on it because honestly, Jake,"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"we should get a Mountain Brews Forklift song."
01:41:22;01:41:25;"That would probably actually be your TikTok breakthrough."
01:41:25;01:41:26;"Fully agree."
01:41:26;01:41:30;"Night Shift by Bob Marley is the number one song on TikTok,"
01:41:30;01:41:34;"specifically the part where he talks about a forklift."
01:41:34;01:41:39;"I desperately need that TikTok breakthrough."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"I'm a 44 year old man. I need that."
01:41:41;01:41:44;"There was a few people who did the Mountain Brews challenge on TikTok,"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"I seem to recall from our thread."
01:41:46;01:41:50;"Yeah, there were a few people that were at trailheads, like Kraken Brews."
01:41:50;01:41:53;"Love to see it. Delighted me."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"Okay, this is a tight song."
01:41:55;01:42:01;"The Bangles, Manic Monday, written by Prince."
01:42:01;01:42:04;"I didn't know it was written by Prince. Interesting."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Prince wrote major, major hits for other artists."
01:42:06;01:42:12;"Yeah, he could write those kind of twee pop songs if he wanted to."
01:42:12;01:42:20;"86 is a weird year though."
01:42:20;01:42:31;"Also, so far there is a lot of throwback vibes."
01:42:31;01:42:34;"Actually, when you think about it, it's the exact same melody."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"Forgive me when I wrote this."
01:42:36;01:42:51;"I've seen you in a phone and fat."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Wish you were Sunday."
01:42:52;01:42:53;"Is this the same?"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Do you think that there's?"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Yeah."
01:42:55;01:42:56;"Go on."
01:42:56;01:43:00;"When did Prince drop his 60s album with Raspberry Beret and the kind of like,"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"what year did that come out?"
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Is that around the world?"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"I think before this."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"I think it's 84, 82."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"Hold on."
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Oh, 85."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"Okay."
01:43:10;01:43:13;"So he was in his 60s zone mentally."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"I was just wondering."
01:43:14;01:43:15;"60s bubblegum."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"Yeah."
01:43:16;01:43:23;"The beginning of a second term president, like a year into it."
01:43:23;01:43:28;"Is that just in general, just sort of like a forgettable year?"
01:43:28;01:43:31;"Is that just a weird off year for everybody?"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"That's a good question."
01:43:32;01:43:36;"I don't know if no, it's not exciting."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"You say a person, right?"
01:43:38;01:43:41;"We're we're a year or two in like Reagan's."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"This is like the middle of Reagan's second term."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"Yeah."
01:43:45;01:43:48;"That just like a boring time or a, or a, like, I don't think if,"
01:43:48;01:43:52;"if Walter Mondale had won the 84 presidential election,"
01:43:52;01:43:55;"that music would have been different."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"I'm sorry."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"This still would have come out."
01:43:57;01:43:58;"I mean,"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"I feel like maybe the Adam Curtis take would be like, you know,"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"deep into Reagan's second term,"
01:44:02;01:44:08;"the counterculture was dead as a doornail and there's nothing to do,"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"but pick over the carcass of old culture."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"The future had been canceled."
01:44:13;01:44:17;"There's nothing to believe that people have been saying that for 40 years."
01:44:17;01:44:20;"There was a tweet I sent to my brother today."
01:44:20;01:44:22;"It's this from this guy, Dean kissick."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"He's a art critic, dude."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"He wrote,"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"I read an essay by that guy and actually bookmarked something to bring to TC."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Wow."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"Great minds."
01:44:31;01:44:32;"All right."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"We have them on the show."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"Yeah."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"He wrote today,"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"a tweet we're trapped in the world."
01:44:37;01:44:41;"Frederick Jamison foretold the world in which stylistic innovation is no"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"longer possible."
01:44:42;01:44:45;"All that is left is to imitate dead styles."
01:44:45;01:44:51;"Oasis to speak through the masks and with the voices of the styles in the"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"imaginary museum heavy."
01:44:53;01:44:54;"I mean,"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"this is sort of like,"
01:44:55;01:44:56;"you know,"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"it's like some end of his classic TC."
01:44:59;01:45:00;"Yeah."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"And like,"
01:45:01;01:45:05;"there was crazy cultural innovation in the 20th century."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"And then at some point,"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"like it starts eating itself and like,"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"right."
01:45:10;01:45:13;"And it's no coincidence that that corresponds with the,"
01:45:13;01:45:17;"the internet casting this whole new way that people interact with each other"
01:45:17;01:45:23;"and perceive the past and information that obviously has a huge part of it."
01:45:23;01:45:24;"Well,"
01:45:24;01:45:25;"then my brother wrote back,"
01:45:25;01:45:26;"he goes pessimistic."
01:45:26;01:45:30;"He discounts that a constantly changing world imbues the same styles with"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"different meanings at different times."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"Who is Dean kissick,"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"which I think is a great call."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"My brother's part."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"It's sort of like,"
01:45:38;01:45:42;"they might not actually be disagreeing with each other in that sense."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"Right."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"This is the Dean kissick quote."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"It's funny."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"We don't really know who this dude is,"
01:45:47;01:45:51;"but I was just on some website and I clicked on an article that he wrote."
01:45:51;01:45:54;"And this part stood out to me as being very TC."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"There's just too much of everything."
01:45:56;01:45:58;"There are too many different Oreos,"
01:45:58;01:46:01;"65 flavors in eight years is too many,"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"too many hot chicken wing Oreos,"
01:46:03;01:46:04;"waffle and syrup Oreos,"
01:46:04;01:46:05;"jelly donut Oreos,"
01:46:05;01:46:06;"Supreme Oreos."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"There's too much content that appears different,"
01:46:08;01:46:09;"but is the same."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Too many identities are available to us."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Too many manias,"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"too many hysteria is examine nearly any aspect of society."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"And you can see it's gone too far."
01:46:18;01:46:21;"The reason so many flavors of Oreos are invented,"
01:46:21;01:46:26;"according to the cookies brand director is that this over abundance of choice"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"reminds us of,"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"and drives us back to the original."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"It reminds us of how much we like the old Oreo,"
01:46:32;01:46:35;"the platonic ideal of the Oreos of childhood,"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"the Proustian Oreo with a glass of cold milk."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"When there's too much of everything."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"However, at some point,"
01:46:40;01:46:41;"the original is lost."
01:46:41;01:46:44;"The memory is lost and all that remains are faded,"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"flat hollowed out derivatives."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"So pretty complimentary."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I think I just forgot."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Get this guy on the show."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"It's very Adam Curtis too."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"It intersects a lot too with Mark Fisher,"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"the writer,"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"the K-punk dude."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"A lot of people like digging."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"And I think everybody,"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"even if people have a different point of view,"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"Dave or Dean Kisic,"
01:47:07;01:47:08;"Mark Fisher,"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"the Oreos creative brand director."
01:47:11;01:47:14;"It's like people might have a different interpretation,"
01:47:14;01:47:19;"but there definitely seems to be a unanimous feeling that we're in some"
01:47:19;01:47:20;"sort of exhausted,"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"weird moment."
01:47:22;01:47:27;"And that has something to do with being at the end of history,"
01:47:27;01:47:28;"the internet,"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"too much of everything,"
01:47:30;01:47:34;"the past being picked over infinitely."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"Like it's all pointing towards whatever your take is."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"There's something,"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"a feeling coming together."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"- Yeah."
01:47:40;01:47:41;"It's funny with like,"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"if you're talking about music,"
01:47:42;01:47:45;"like the rock and roll form is like what 70 years old."
01:47:45;01:47:50;"All of the major ideas were explored in the first 20 years from the mid 50s"
01:47:50;01:47:51;"to like,"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"let's say 25 years,"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"mid 50s to like the early 80s."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"And then since then the last 40--"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"- That roughly covers it."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"And then hip hop--"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"- Roughly 40 something."
01:48:00;01:48:01;"Of course,"
01:48:01;01:48:02;"I'm talking about rock though,"
01:48:02;01:48:03;"but yes,"
01:48:03;01:48:04;"I--"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"- No,"
01:48:05;01:48:06;"and then--"
01:48:06;01:48:07;"- But hip hop's already--"
01:48:07;01:48:08;"- And then hip hop had its 30 years."
01:48:08;01:48:09;"If you want to be generous with both,"
01:48:09;01:48:10;"you could say 35."
01:48:10;01:48:11;"And then hip hop's had its 35 years."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"And we'll see."
01:48:12;01:48:17;"But I think one thing that a lot of these cultural critics don't really take"
01:48:17;01:48:21;"into account when they talk about the exhausted art forms of the past and how"
01:48:21;01:48:24;"they're picked over infinitely is that yes,"
01:48:24;01:48:31;"it's very difficult to make interesting music in the rock form in the modern"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"day,"
01:48:32;01:48:37;"but there are these kind of meta art forms in a Borghesean fashion,"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"I'm not ashamed to admit,"
01:48:38;01:48:39;"to say,"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"such as internet radio."
01:48:41;01:48:45;"That radically recontextualizes the past."
01:48:45;01:48:52;"And maybe people who are feeling a little bit bummed out about where music's"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"at,"
01:48:53;01:48:57;"they should dig a little deeper into the exciting world of internet radio"
01:48:57;01:49:01;"because then you get people will be talking about the Grateful Dead and"
01:49:01;01:49:07;"talking heads and use that as a jumping off point to talk--"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"no,"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"actually,"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"use that as a jumping off point to talk about something else."
01:49:11;01:49:12;"I'm done with this bit,"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"actually."
01:49:13;01:49:14;"But there's a little something--"
01:49:14;01:49:18;"I just kept thinking of my old coworker crushing that Chipotle burrito going,"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"""It's rocks played out,"

01:49:20;01:49:21;"Well,"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"the truth is--"
01:49:22;01:49:23;"And that was 10 years ago."
01:49:23;01:49:24;"That was 10 years ago."
01:49:24;01:49:28;"But think about how often we reference that great story that you told us"
01:49:28;01:49:29;"because--"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Great story."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"In that moment,"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"your coworker crushing the burrito and saying,"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"""Rocks played out."""
01:49:35;01:49:39;"He thought that he was bringing this pessimistic energy and just being like,"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"""Damn, man."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"It's sad,"

01:49:42;01:49:44;"Little did he know that by saying that,"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"he was opening up a whole new universe of art."
01:49:46;01:49:49;"He was the artist in that moment."
01:49:49;01:49:52;"What your coworker did by crushing that burrito and saying,"
01:49:52;01:49:53;"""Rocks played out,"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"dog,"""
01:49:54;01:49:58;"in a strange way is the equivalent of Chuck Berry picking up a guitar for the"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"first time."

01:50:04;01:50:06;"I don't know."
01:50:06;01:50:07;"Yeah."
01:50:07;01:50:09;"If you're working with the same chord progressions,"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"I just--"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"I don't--"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"I remember in the '90s,"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"it was like,"

01:50:14;01:50:15;"Electronic is the future."""

01:50:19;01:50:21;"It was window dressing at the end of the day."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"So it's sort of like--"
01:50:22;01:50:23;"And then also,"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"you could get in some deep,"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"crazy fusion,"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"but it's like,"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"how different do you really want the chord progressions to be?"
01:50:28;01:50:29;"You don't."
01:50:29;01:50:31;"You don't want them to be that different."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"The one thing I've never really heard anyone say is that--"
01:50:33;01:50:34;"However you--"
01:50:34;01:50:35;"Like you said,"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"it's window dressing for an emotion."

01:50:54;01:50:58;"they're just saying this is a vehicle for telling a story or an emotion."

01:51:02;01:51:03;"I mean,"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"I do think when we talk about hip hop or rap specifically,"
01:51:06;01:51:09;"it's because it's so born out of using technology."
01:51:09;01:51:13;"It allows itself to kind of constantly morph."

01:51:50;01:51:51;"We're really getting deep now."
01:51:51;01:51:53;"But also one thing for sure is that,"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"and I've seen people make this point before."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"I'm not taking issue with any one quote in particular,"
01:51:58;01:52:08;"but when people get really intense or dismissive about the fact that art forms are not innovating at the rate that they once did,"
01:52:08;01:52:18;"they are also betraying their own allegiance in a meta way to a 20th century model of how art is supposed to progress."
01:52:18;01:52:20;"You know what I mean?"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"Yes,"
01:52:21;01:52:22;"I do."
01:52:22;01:52:24;"So the dude who's crushing the burrito,"
01:52:24;01:52:28;"I recently was just referring to him as being a type of visionary hero of sorts,"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"but I'm going to take the alternate view now."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"When he says rock's played out,"
01:52:32;01:52:40;"he's being a very much a 20th century kind of hater who expects things to click along at a certain rate."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"He expects a new guitar tone ASAP."
01:52:42;01:52:45;"He expects some new vibe,"
01:52:45;01:52:46;"you know,"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"and the question that I would ask,"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"why is it so odious to be played out,"
01:52:50;01:52:51;"dog?"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Which a lot of people don't know."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"Jake said back to him as a dude crushed the burrito."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"We've never for the first time ever."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"We're revealing the rest of the conversation."

01:53:02;01:53:05;"The guy said rocks played out dog and Jake turned him and said,"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"sir,"
01:53:07;01:53:11;"I must ask what is so odious about being played out?"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"I said to him,"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"I said,"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"sir,"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"we're both visual artists."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"We're both painters."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Talk about played out,"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"sir."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"There's been millennia,"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"literally millennia of painting."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Shall I?"
01:53:25;01:53:26;"It's a little bit Jim Morrison."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"Oh,"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"very much."
01:53:28;01:53:31;"Shall I lay down my paint brushes?"
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Because what you described is so odious,"
01:53:33;01:53:37;"this feeling of being played out for me when I feel played out,"
01:53:37;01:53:39;"I feel powerful."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"I feel like a bear."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"I feel like late period Jim Morrison,"
01:53:43;01:53:46;"comfortable in my own skin."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"I mean,"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"yeah,"
01:53:48;01:53:52;"you're right about like people becoming beholden to the 20th century model"
01:53:52;01:53:57;"because the decades after world war two were like a unique time in"
01:53:57;01:54:02;"history where there were like vastly new material conditions in which"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"new art could arise out of,"
01:54:04;01:54:08;"which we're still basically in like in the fifties and sixties after"
01:54:08;01:54:09;"world war two,"
01:54:09;01:54:14;"there was this like massively affluent consumer society of cars and"
01:54:14;01:54:18;"parking lots and supermarkets and radio and TV."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"And that's when rock and roll started baseball diamonds."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"And we're still kind of in that world."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"We have the internet now,"
01:54:25;01:54:29;"but we're still in that world of like shopping centers and cars and TV and"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"mass media,"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"which was the groundwork with that rock and roll came out of."
01:54:34;01:54:37;"So I think unless there's like absolute cat,"
01:54:37;01:54:42;"it has to be like fully cataclysmic societal destruction and then rebirth"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"to actually get truly new forms of art."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"That's what I think."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"I don't want to live through that."
01:54:48;01:54:53;"So I'm fine with just people recapitulating and,"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"and redigesting rock and roll from 50 years ago."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"I think you might be talking about the singularity."
01:54:59;01:55:05;"Maybe I am like the singularity happens and then all sorts of new genres."
01:55:05;01:55:09;"I think we have to live in a completely different material world for truly"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"new forms to come out of."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"It's not going to just happen."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Do you want a new form?"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"Well, no, that's, I'm saying the cost of a new form is a full cataclysmic"
01:55:18;01:55:21;"destruction of society and then a rebuilding."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"I don't want that."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"You don't care about,"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"I don't care about new forms of art enough."
01:55:27;01:55:32;"This is going to be the plot of our Avengers movie is that an evil warlord"
01:55:32;01:55:38;"who is so distraught that rock is played out recognizes that the only way for"
01:55:38;01:55:43;"a new vibe and rock to happen will be a cataclysmic destruction of society."
01:55:43;01:55:47;"So he goes and gets all the Thanos rings and the only person who can stop him"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"is Jake."
01:55:48;01:55:52;"Jake assembles the rest of the crisis crew to be like, it's not worth it, man."
01:55:52;01:55:55;"You can just go listen to old Grateful Dead shows."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"Who gives a f**k?"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Dude, it's not worth it."
01:55:59;01:56:04;"It's not worth the human misery to create new art forms."
01:56:04;01:56:08;"It's just like, let's just start Grateful Dead cover bands."
01:56:08;01:56:11;"It's a cataclysmic destruction of society."
01:56:11;01:56:15;"Well, think about the world pre-World War II and post-World War II."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"Pre-World War II is like the depression."
01:56:17;01:56:22;"It's like after World War II, it's like gleaming supermarkets and like mad men."
01:56:22;01:56:26;"I mean, at least I wasn't alive then, obviously, but that's my like"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"narrativized vision of those different eras."
01:56:28;01:56:33;"And as people have pointed out, the post-war prosperity of the United States"
01:56:33;01:56:38;"was something never before seen in human society"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"and perhaps will never be seen again."
01:56:41;01:56:45;"Even when people describe the rise of China and all that,"
01:56:45;01:56:51;"the specific weird elements that went into the end of the war,"
01:56:51;01:56:54;"the raw materials that were found in this country,"
01:56:54;01:56:56;"the mix of immigrants and stuff,"
01:56:56;01:57:00;"just like the US pulled ahead in such a crazy way in that era"
01:57:00;01:57:05;"that it's possible that no country on earth will ever quite have that"
01:57:05;01:57:09;"type of like unbelievable journey."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"- Stew. - Stew ever again."
01:57:11;01:57:12;"Yeah."
01:57:12;01:57:16;"The way I see it is that Seinfeld's searching the internet"
01:57:16;01:57:20;"and he sort of writes the text thread and says,"
01:57:20;01:57:23;"""Guys, I found a new chord."
01:57:23;01:57:26;"I think that we can change music."""
01:57:26;01:57:30;"And he's sort of, you know, he's f***ing around and he sort of grows in power"
01:57:30;01:57:34;"and that's when Jake has to come in and say like, ""You can't do it."""
01:57:34;01:57:36;"That's the Thanos thing."
01:57:36;01:57:40;"And we could change music, but it would ultimately be..."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"I haven't seen it, but I think you might have, Nick, maybe with your son."
01:57:44;01:57:47;"This is the plot of Trolls 2 World Tour, correct?"
01:57:47;01:57:50;"This is it. Oh my God."
01:57:50;01:57:52;"It's so deeply embedded."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:57:54;01:57:59;"I think that I sort of on my own came up with the plot of Trolls 2."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"But this is Trolls 2 for adults."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"But I think ultimately everyone has to get together."
01:58:03;01:58:06;"There's no one in there that has Jake's point of view, which I really like,"
01:58:06;01:58:11;"which is you could-- which is that sort of eventually you can use that power,"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"but at what cost?"
01:58:13;01:58:16;"Yeah. And the last thing I'll say that's always worth keeping in mind"
01:58:16;01:58:21;"is as much as the Grateful Dead represent the spirit of the '60s"
01:58:21;01:58:24;"and we can look through their discography and see all these innovative things"
01:58:24;01:58:28;"they did and that we can say that album sounds like '68,"
01:58:28;01:58:33;"that sh*t sounds like '78, '86, whatever."
01:58:33;01:58:37;"At the end of the day, the young Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter,"
01:58:37;01:58:42;"these people in Northern California, they were born during World War II."
01:58:42;01:58:45;"They grew up in the '50s prosperity era."
01:58:45;01:58:49;"And part of the culture that they were in, the folk music revival,"
01:58:49;01:58:53;"the pre-hippie whatever, was a little bit about looking around"
01:58:53;01:58:58;"at modern America with all the bells and whistles and being like,"
01:58:58;01:59:01;"""I don't know about all this."""
01:59:01;01:59:04;"It was a little bit about digging into the past."
01:59:04;01:59:08;"Jerry Garcia, sometime in the early days, took a lot of acid."
01:59:08;01:59:12;"He had this real f*cked up experience where he was in Northern California"
01:59:12;01:59:16;"and he really had this deep feeling of horror when he realized"
01:59:16;01:59:20;"that he was on Native American land and he thought about all the bloodshed"
01:59:20;01:59:23;"that had happened, something that I'm sure is very easy to ignore"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"growing up in '50s America."
01:59:25;01:59:31;"And he had this weird feeling of the darkness that modern America was built on."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"So it's worth considering that this dude, they were taking acid"
01:59:34;01:59:39;"not to build the future in the sense of technological progress."
01:59:39;01:59:44;"They're exploring their minds and then spending hours and hours every day"
01:59:44;01:59:48;"learning how to shred bluegrass banjo music."
01:59:48;01:59:50;"You know what I mean?"
01:59:50;01:59:56;"The idea that you can't dig deeply into the past as a way of understanding"
01:59:56;02:00:00;"life and centering yourself and that you need to be committed"
02:00:00;02:00:04;"to what's fresh and new and not played out,"
02:00:04;02:00:08;"it's also a bit of a misunderstanding, I think."
02:00:08;02:00:11;"And I guess bluegrass probably seemed kind of cool in their circles,"
02:00:11;02:00:15;"but just again, visualize this guy from Northern California"
02:00:15;02:00:20;"spending hours and hours every day just learning the technical aspects"
02:00:20;02:00:25;"of this old music, bluegrass, literally digging into the past"
02:00:25;02:00:29;"in the prime period of exciting new music."
02:00:29;02:00:31;"There's some kind of lesson there."
02:00:31;02:00:33;"- Oh, absolutely. Yeah, fully agree."
02:00:33;02:00:38;"I mean, if you're obsessed with the future, you'll be a futurist."
02:00:38;02:00:42;"And that was a movement of painters in Italy in the '20s."
02:00:42;02:00:47;"You see that stuff. It's very dated, not alive."
02:00:47;02:00:49;"It's like the Jetsons or something."
02:00:49;02:00:51;"It's just like, ""Okay, yeah, the future. Cool."""
02:00:51;02:00:54;"- The Italian futurists did not produce the Europe '72."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"- No, they did not."
02:00:56;02:00:59;"- And they're from Europe, so that's just sad."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"They're actually Europeans."

02:01:03;02:01:05;"- Where are we on this top five?"
02:01:05;02:01:07;"- The number two song."
