06:09;06:11;"That was Young Money with ""Bedrock."""
06:11;06:13;"I don't know why I wanted to listen to that song today."
06:13;06:15;"I was thinking about it a little bit this week."
06:15;06:17;"It was a great song."
06:17;06:21;"You know, there's like a parallel that can be drawn there."
06:21;06:24;"There's ""Eat the Booty,"" like ""Groceries Now,"""
06:24;06:26;"and ""Grocery Bag."""
06:26;06:29;"I mean, ""Grocery Bag"" is the most famous line from that song,"
06:29;06:31;"in my world, at least."
06:31;06:32;"No, I think in everybody's world."
06:32;06:34;"'Cause it was confusing."
06:34;06:35;"And it was also kind of the--"
06:35;06:38;"it was maybe at the inception of the--"
06:38;06:39;"Hashtag."
06:39;06:40;"Hashtag rap, yeah."
06:40;06:41;"No, that was a huge line."
06:41;06:43;"And I got a grocery bag."
06:43;06:44;"Grocery bag."
06:44;06:46;"I was like, ""Hey, grocery bagged."""
06:46;06:48;"This was an argument I had with some people,"
06:48;06:49;"'cause it was like, ""Oh, I--"""
06:49;06:51;"That might be a little better if it said ""grocery bagged."""
06:51;06:53;"Right, 'cause it's like, ""I bagged her. I got her."
06:53;06:55;"""Grocery bagged."""
06:55;06:56;"There's something weird about saying ""eat groceries."""
06:56;06:57;"I don't know why."
06:57;06:58;"Yeah."
06:58;07:02;"Groceries generally have to be prepared before they're eaten."
07:02;07:05;"And also, groceries could include like Ajax, Tide--"
07:05;07:06;"Toilet paper, yeah."
07:06;07:07;"Toilet paper."
07:07;07:09;"[laughing]"
07:09;07:10;"You like that?"
07:10;07:12;"Welcome to ""Time Crisis."""
07:12;07:16;"Today we're coming live from literally Hollywood, California."
07:16;07:18;"Some people don't realize that Hollywood is actually"
07:18;07:20;"a neighborhood in Los Angeles."
07:20;07:22;"Me and Despot both happen to be out here."
07:22;07:23;"Yeah."
07:23;07:24;"Sorry, Cousin Asher."
07:24;07:26;"Cousin Asher's out on the East Coast."
07:26;07:29;"Filling in for Asher, we got Jake Longstreth."
07:29;07:30;"'Sup?"
07:30;07:34;"Now, Jake, you're a longtime resident of L.A."
07:34;07:36;"Yeah, long-ish."
07:36;07:39;"You're somebody who's from Connecticut originally,"
07:39;07:42;"so I think you really identify with the West Coast."
07:42;07:43;"Absolutely."
07:43;07:46;"Can you give us a little history about where you've lived?"
07:46;07:47;"Sure."
07:47;07:50;"I mean, my entire adult life, except for 2 years,"
07:50;07:52;"I've been on the West Coast--"
07:52;07:56;"Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, Oakland, and L.A."
07:56;08:01;"So pretty much the bulk of the Bohemian West Coast enclaves."
08:01;08:02;"And you're a painter."
08:02;08:03;"Yeah."
08:03;08:05;"I first met Jake because his younger brother's"
08:05;08:07;"Dave Longstreth of Dirty Projectors,"
08:07;08:09;"and Jake and I actually went on tour together,"
08:09;08:10;"playing with the DPs."
08:10;08:12;"Dude, that was 10 years ago exactly."
08:12;08:13;"That's crazy."
08:13;08:14;"Summer '05."
08:15;08:16;"Double minivan assault."
08:16;08:20;"Rolling through America, playing art spaces,"
08:20;08:21;"homes, sleeping on floors."
08:21;08:23;"Yeah, Shreveport, Louisiana."
08:23;08:25;"Yeah, that was a big one, Shreveport, Louisiana."
08:25;08:26;"Well, thanks for joining us, Jake."
08:26;08:27;"Yeah, man."
08:27;08:29;"Jake knows a lot about rock music."
08:29;08:30;"I know a lot of our listeners at home"
08:30;08:32;"might not even know what that is,"
08:32;08:34;"but Jake's going to hip us to some of what's good"
08:34;08:36;"about rock music, and specifically a band"
08:36;08:38;"very much associated with the West Coast,"
08:38;08:39;"The Grateful Dead."
08:39;08:41;"We're going to get into that a little bit later."
08:41;08:43;"It's funny, because I was thinking about--"
08:43;08:45;"because you sent that text yesterday that was like,"
08:45;08:49;"pick a few songs and then make a case to the youth"
08:49;08:51;"why they're not trash."
08:51;08:53;"And I was like, well, first of all,"
08:53;08:56;"you have to like music with guitars."
08:56;08:58;"Well, anybody can be-- well, hold on."
08:58;08:59;"I think we've got to go into some music."
08:59;09:00;"I want to get into all this."
09:00;09:02;"In the meantime, since we're out in L.A.,"
09:02;09:04;"I figured we might as well listen to some"
09:04;09:06;"California music, so I've been thinking about this guy"
09:06;09:10;"a bit recently, because there's a movie that involves him"
09:10;09:11;"coming out very soon."

13:46;13:48;"But that don't mean a n***a can't rest in the west"
13:48;13:52;"Seize a nice... in the west, smoke a nice... in the west"
13:52;13:54;"Y'all... is a mess, think you're not gonna stop"
13:54;13:59;"Give an L.A. prop, all I got is beef with those that violate me"
13:59;14:00;"I shall annihilate you"
14:00;14:03;"Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes"
14:03;14:05;"Linens and things, I'll begin things"
14:05;14:10;"Beep a... flag, 818, 213s, 313s, B-I-G"
14:10;14:12;"Frequently floss... that Roscoe"
14:12;14:15;"If I want a... take her to Fatburger"
14:15;14:17;"Spend about a week on Venice Beach"
14:17;14:19;"Sipping Crisco with some freaks from Frisco"
14:19;14:39;"I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali"
14:39;14:41;"Cali got... models on the runway"
14:41;14:44;"Scream Biggie, Biggie, give me one more chance"
14:44;14:46;"I'll be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way"
14:46;14:48;"On the selly-selly with my homeboy Lance"
14:48;14:50;"Pass... from left to right"
14:50;14:52;"Only got five... left to light"
14:52;14:53;"I'm set tonight"
14:53;14:55;"Met a... at the Versace store"
14:55;14:57;"Setty suck it 'til I ain't got no more"
14:57;15:00;"Only in L.A., bust on... L.A."
15:00;15:02;"Rub it in their tummy, lick it, say it's yummy"
15:02;15:04;"Then... your man, what's your plan?"
15:04;15:06;"Is it to rock the tri-state?"
15:06;15:08;"Almost gold, 5G's the show date"
15:08;15:10;"Or do you wanna see about seven digits?"
15:10;15:13;"Hold the... Cali, great place to visit"
15:13;15:42;"I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali"
15:42;15:47;"I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali"
15:52;15:56;"I'm going, going back, back to Cali, Cali"
15:56;16:00;"Time Crisis with Ezra King"
16:00;16:02;"Be-be-be-be-be-beats"
16:02;16:04;"One"
16:04;16:08;"That was our little, kinda California-themed rap block"
16:08;16:10;"We just looked up the Sugar Freeze from Pomona"
16:10;16:11;"That's where we were last week"
16:11;16:13;"Yeah, we were in Pomona"
16:13;16:14;"So what do you think about that?"
16:14;16:16;"Well, first of all, for everybody who's listening"
16:16;16:18;"Despai and I were both at Hardfest"
16:18;16:21;"We performed our song with Makonnen for the first time"
16:21;16:23;"So what was your take on Hardfest?"
16:23;16:25;"Uh..."
16:25;16:28;"I've never been to Hardfest"
16:28;16:32;"I don't think I've ever been to an EDM festival"
16:32;16:33;"What was Hardfest?"
16:33;16:35;"An EDM festival"
16:35;16:37;"Jake, are you familiar with the phrase EDM?"
16:37;16:38;"Yeah"
16:38;16:41;"'Cause Jake, as we said before, is our resident rock guy"
16:41;16:43;"Electronic dance music"
16:43;16:44;"That's right"
16:44;16:46;"Electronic dance music"
16:46;16:50;"Hardest probably the biggest, kinda brand-name festival for EDM"
16:50;16:52;"This one, it's all over the place"
16:52;16:55;"But this one specifically was out in Pomona at the Fairplex"
16:55;16:58;"And the headliner the night that we were there was Jack U"
16:58;17:00;"Which is Skrillex and Diplo"
17:00;17:01;"They brought Bieber out"
17:01;17:04;"So it's a pretty big festival, multiple stages"
17:04;17:05;"They brought out the Biebs"
17:06;17:08;"Did you watch that?"
17:08;17:10;"No, I was watching Rat-A-Tat"
17:10;17:12;"Rat-A-Tat was it?"
17:12;17:13;"Yeah"
17:13;17:14;"That's cool"
17:14;17:17;"Yeah, Rat-A-Tat's about as rocky as you'd get at Hardfest"
17:17;17:19;"And Makonnen was there"
17:19;17:20;"And so we came out and did the song"
17:20;17:22;"We did it, it was really hot"
17:22;17:27;"It was okay, I think that song would be better performed maybe next time at a Makonnen show"
17:27;17:31;"Yeah, I don't think anybody knew who we were or what that song was or anything"
17:31;17:34;"I think you had a lot of people on Molly, they wanted to hear"
17:34;17:35;"The song about Molly"
17:35;17:37;"The song about Molly"
17:37;17:39;"But it was still fun"
17:39;17:40;"I don't know about that"
17:40;17:42;"I felt weird though, I felt out of place kind of"
17:42;17:43;"You felt old?"
17:43;17:46;"I got drunk though and then I felt not old"
17:46;17:50;"And it was fun I guess"
17:50;17:55;"I was offered a b**** job at one point and I turned it down"
17:55;17:56;"Hey"
17:56;17:58;"Which made me feel old I guess"
17:58;17:59;"Strong"
17:59;18:00;"That made me feel old"
18:00;18:02;"Everybody wants to have a good time at a festival"
18:02;18:03;"Right"
18:04;18:07;"Are people drinking at this?"
18:07;18:08;"Yes"
18:08;18:10;"It's all underage drinking?"
18:10;18:14;"Yeah, but first and foremost EDM Festival is about MDMA"
18:14;18:16;"We don't endorse that necessarily"
18:16;18:19;"I mean people gotta do what they're gonna do"
18:19;18:22;"I'm not a big fan of that drug, that particular drug"
18:22;18:24;"It makes me feel sticky"
18:24;18:25;"Sticky?"
18:25;18:27;"Like literally sticky?"
18:27;18:28;"Like your skin feels sticky?"
18:28;18:31;"Like if you've been out all day and it's hot out and you were sweating"
18:31;18:35;"And then you get home and the sweat dries on you and you feel a little gross"
18:35;18:37;"And you need a shower"
18:37;18:39;"That's what Molly makes me feel like"
18:39;18:42;"One thing I find interesting about Molly is it feels like in some ways"
18:42;18:45;"That and lean feel like the last drugs"
18:45;18:50;"It seems like so much of youth culture is about a new drug coming out"
18:50;18:53;"That everybody starts doing and it kind of syncs up with the music"
18:53;18:56;"And of course you had that in the 60s with like weed and psychedelics"
18:56;18:57;"Suddenly everybody has that"
18:57;18:59;"It goes very well with say, Your Grateful Dead"
18:59;19:01;"You had Ludes"
19:01;19:03;"And then you had Ludes in the 70s"
19:03;19:06;"To help people listen to James Taylor or whatever"
19:06;19:12;"And then in the late 80s you have the birth of like true massive rave culture"
19:12;19:16;"In England with MDA, MDMA, Molly, whatever"
19:16;19:18;"Ecstasy is what they were calling it"
19:18;19:20;"Ecstasy is what they were calling it back then"
19:20;19:24;"And it kind of also syncs up with like Acid House and trance music all comes together"
19:24;19:27;"And then maybe in the early 90s you have the birth of like lean and the"
19:27;19:30;"You know, whatever DJ Screw type stuff"
19:30;19:34;"But like it almost feels like we're waiting for a new drug to sync up with youth culture"
19:34;19:36;"Or maybe I just don't know because I'm getting older"
19:36;19:38;"What are some of the new ones?"
19:38;19:41;"There's K2 which is the synthetic weed"
19:41;19:46;"But like it makes people turn into crazy zombies and do all types of f***ed up sh*t"
19:46;19:47;"That sounds horrible"
19:47;19:50;"Yeah and bath salts, that's new"
19:50;19:54;"That's so dark that there's a new weed that turns into a zombie"
19:54;20:00;"Weed is supposed to be the most chill, kind drug"
20:00;20:03;"And it's so dark that we're at a point where it's just sort of like"
20:03;20:05;"No, synthetic and it's harsh"
20:05;20:08;"Isn't it kind of a good metaphor though? That the dream of the 60s is dead?"
20:08;20:10;"Yeah, pharmaceuticals now"
20:10;20:12;"But these sound like very dangerous drugs"
20:12;20:15;"They are, but that's what keeps happening"
20:15;20:20;"Is that these giant companies take advantage of the fact that like illegal drugs are illegal"
20:20;20:22;"So it's like let's make this horrible sh*t"
20:22;20:26;"That's completely chemical and will ruin everything"
29:11;29:16;"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."
29:16;29:21;"So how you doing Jake? Great man. Haven't seen you in a while. What's your day to day like these days?"
29:21;29:27;"Fainin'? Yeah I'm in my studio a lot, down in Little Tokyo. I've been traveling this summer too a little bit."
29:27;29:33;"Where you been? Playing some music. Just a route, you know, up to the Bay Area, up to Portland, nothing crazy."
29:33;29:39;"Any camping? Yep, went to the Channel Islands. Where's that? Channel Islands National Park."
29:39;29:47;"Is that near here? Yeah. It's off the coast of California? You drive out to Ventura, and then you get on a ferry, and you take, it's like an hour out to these islands."
29:47;29:53;"On the way out, you see whales. And when we did it, we saw 14 humpback whales."
29:53;30:00;"14? That's a lot. And one blue whale, which apparently, I didn't know this, is the largest animal to ever live."
30:00;30:06;"I mean, but it's a chill, it's a chill animal. Have you seen those videos on the internet of whales exploding?"
30:06;30:12;"Oh, that are on the beach? Yeah, like. Because they fill with gas and they explode? Yeah, that's sad. It's disgusting."
30:12;30:23;"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion. Is that, what, is that me? That's the whales. Was that like a shot at me? Moving on."
30:23;30:31;"She's here, Mr. Johnson. Okay, thank you very much. Granny, they're expecting you. You're a little late, so come right this way."
30:31;30:36;"Start writing, okay? What? Say it now? Yeah. Say it now? Yeah."
30:36;30:47;"Me and the Ohio Panthers gonna tell you about a worm. He's the funkiest worm in the world. Okay, say it, fellas."
30:47;30:53;"There's a worm in the ground, yes, there is. That's right. That's right."
30:53;31:04;"And six feet down, six feet down, he only comes around when he wants to get down."
31:04;31:23;"But when he comes out of his hole, he sounds something like this. Ooh, that's funky, that's funky."
31:23;31:31;"Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky. Come on with it again, fellas, come on with it."
31:31;31:40;"In a foreign land, yeah, yeah. Say it. He plays guitar without any hands."
31:40;31:46;"He plays guitar without any hands. Pretty good, I might add. Yeah."
31:46;31:57;"When he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck, everybody wants to get up and dance."
31:57;32:09;"I'll get it, baby. I'm his manager, yeah."
32:09;32:15;"Gonna make a million dollars. I'll get it all till he can't spend it."
32:15;32:24;"Don't stop now, honey, get down. That's it, that's it."
32:24;32:32;"Don't fight the feeling. Don't fight it."
32:32;32:45;"Okay, that's enough. Get out of here. Here you go, people, listen to this. This is really funky. Get out of here."
32:45;32:55;"Going back in his hole, it's the same way he came out. Do we get paid for this? I want to know."
32:55;33:00;"Yes, of course. We do? Okay, okay. Alright. You're welcome."
33:00;33:05;"So, Jake, I'd like to talk a little bit about your history as a music fan. Have you always been kind of a rock dude?"
33:05;33:11;"I guess. I don't know. I mean, yeah. That's kind of what, I mean, I never thought about it."
33:11;33:22;"I think The Grateful Dead, and the reason that I wanted you to specifically talk about them today is because, A, I think a lot of kids out there think they're trash without even knowing anything about them, and probably haven't even heard them."
33:22;33:35;"And I think also The Grateful Dead is a band that became so much bigger as a concept that people instinctively recoil from it because The Grateful Dead represents a type of person or maybe an ideology."
33:35;33:47;"Absolutely. I mean, I remember I came into the Dead pretty casually. My folks were into the Dead. Not like heavy Deadheads. They just had a few records. And I grew up listening to them and really liked them."
33:47;33:58;"It was never like a huge Deadhead. And then I remember hanging out in these snotty, uptight indie rock circles, and people were just like, ""You like the Dead?"""
33:58;34:06;"And I was like, ""Yeah, I mean, I like pavement. I like the Dead. It's all kind of like this West Coast, lackadaisical rock. It's just good songwriting, good guitar playing."""
34:06;34:19;"And it was such a divisive band. It's a funny thing about the Dead, too, is their musical legacy sucks. Like, fish sucks. Widespread panic sucks. Leftover salmon sucks. Like, all those jam bands bite."
34:19;34:36;"And so I can see, and that scene seems kind of lame. Their virtuosity and their musicality is much more organic and their own. It's not like Berklee School of Music guitar shredder dudes, which I feel like a lot of the jam band dudes are."
34:36;34:48;"And the Dead were just like this weird amalgam. No one has ever played guitar like Jerry Garcia or bass like Phil Lesh. I know that sounds like a dork, but it's true. I mean, there's a real lyricism there."
34:48;35:04;"Okay, Jake. So, you know, now that Apple's provided us with this incredible platform, Beats 1, we ask you to pick a few Grateful Dead songs to try to educate the youth, because we know the majority of kids out there think the Grateful Dead are trash, reminds them of good-for-nothing people."
35:04;35:05;"I don't know where you got that from."
35:05;35:07;"Trash is a harsh word, dude."
35:07;35:10;"That's what kids say now. It's not as bad as it sounds."
35:10;35:15;"But, like, I've never heard a young kid say, ""Yo, Grateful Dead are trash, man."""
35:15;35:21;"That's because they say they're trash and then they don't speak of it again, because they hate them so much."
35:21;35:24;"But they wear the t-shirts."
35:24;35:31;"That's true. They do wear the t-shirts, so perhaps there is some hope that you could convince the youth that the Grateful Dead are not trash."
35:31;35:40;"So, Jake, we want to give you the opportunity to go three rounds, pick three songs to really make a case for why the Grateful Dead are not trash and maybe even good. So, where do you want to start?"
35:40;35:46;"Pressure's on, dude. I want to start with Scarlet Begonias from 1974."
35:46;35:53;"When it starts, you may think it sounds like the subsequent jam bands that are stealing from the dead."
35:53;35:58;"Keep in mind it's from '74. It's a solid 20 years before Phish really hit their peak."
35:58;35:59;"Okay."
35:59;36:03;"And Phish and all those other jam bands never wrote a song this good."
36:03;36:09;"Okay. Strong words from Jake. Apologies to Phish. This is Grateful Dead with Scarlet Begonias."

37:28;37:31;"The full song is four minutes, twenty seconds. Is that just a weird coincidence?"
37:31;37:34;"We missed... No. That is not a coincidence."
37:34;37:37;"Oh, we missed the guitar solo? We missed the Jerry guitar solo."
37:37;37:39;"All right. Let's listen to the guitar solo."
37:39;37:41;"[laughter]"
37:41;37:47;"♪"
38:05;38:09;"That was the Jerry Garcia guitar solo from Scarlet Begonias."
38:09;38:11;"Apologies for not playing the whole thing."
38:11;38:14;"Alec, what do you think of the Grateful Dead?"
38:14;38:21;"Well, my parents were like hippies. I guess they are hippies."
38:21;38:25;"Right now they're at a house just outside of Woodstock."
38:25;38:27;"Very hippie. I was going to say Woodstock."
38:27;38:31;"I remember devoting one day to being like,"
38:31;38:34;"""I'm going to like the Grateful Dead because so many people do."""
38:34;38:38;"And I tried and I'm not sure if I did."
38:38;38:39;"But you never thought they were trash?"
38:39;38:40;"I didn't think they were trash."
38:40;38:41;"You're not like the kids today."
38:41;38:42;"[laughter]"
38:42;38:44;"I think the Grateful Dead get better and better."
38:44;38:46;"I would agree with that sentiment."
38:46;38:50;"Well, Jake, I don't know if Scarlet Begonias really got the kids on your side."
38:50;38:53;"The phone lines are lighting up. A lot of kids saying that's trash."
38:53;38:55;"We want to hear more new music."
38:55;38:57;"But we want to hear at least a few songs."
38:57;38:59;"The Dead, okay, here's the thing, man."
38:59;39:06;"In one sense, their iconography and surface level appreciation of the dead is at a height right now."
39:06;39:12;"But the actual content of their career is somehow maybe antithetical to this internet era"
39:12;39:17;"where we're sort of like, ""We don't have time to listen to this four-minute song."""
39:17;39:18;"It's true. We're too hyper today."
39:18;39:22;"It's just like the rewards of their music are maybe slower to reveal themselves."
39:22;39:25;"But I think they're richer for it."
39:25;39:28;"Yeah, it's like books. It's like nobody reads books anymore."
39:28;39:34;"But a lot of people say that spending time with even something crazy like a 500-page book"
39:34;39:41;"would actually be more rewarding than reading maybe 500 different tweets."
39:41;39:44;"Okay, Jake, what you got for us next from the Grateful Dead catalog?"
39:44;39:48;"I chose ""Box of Rain."" It's the first song off ""American Beauty."""
39:48;39:50;"And it's a beautiful song."
39:50;39:52;"Okay, here's the Grateful Dead with ""Box of Rain."""
40:10;40:22;"Look out at any window, any morning, any evening, any day."
40:22;40:35;"Maybe the sun is shining, birds are singing, or the rain is falling from a heavy skyline."
40:35;40:40;"What do you want me to do for you?"
40:40;40:45;"To see you cry."
40:45;40:49;"For this is time of the day."
40:49;40:53;"One afternoon on the dot."
40:53;40:58;"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."
40:58;41:00;"Harsh juxtaposition."
41:00;41:02;"That was the Grateful Dead with ""Box of Rain."""
41:02;41:04;"That is a beautiful song. I know that song."
41:04;41:06;"There's something almost like..."
41:06;41:11;"It's a little countryish, but there's also something vaguely medieval about it."
41:11;41:13;"It's dark. It has a dark majesty."
41:13;41:16;"Okay, Jake, I don't know if you're convincing the youth quite yet,"
41:16;41:19;"but I do think you're making a pretty strong case for the Grateful Dead,"
41:19;41:21;"at the very least, not being trash."
41:21;41:27;"I think even if their music doesn't really measure up to the iconography, I think..."
41:27;41:29;"It does measure up to the iconography."
41:29;41:31;"Okay. I remember there was a girl..."
41:31;41:36;"That's just your opinion, man. Okay?"
41:36;41:39;"How about one more Grateful Dead song to try to slam dunk"
41:39;41:42;"on all these kids saying the Grateful Dead are trash?"
41:42;41:46;"Let's do a Bob Weir song. ""Jack Straw."" It's off Europe 72."
41:46;41:48;"So this is a live recording, kids."
41:48;41:49;"Live in Paris."
41:49;41:50;"Live in Paris in '72."
41:50;41:52;"Did the French people like the Grateful Dead?"
41:52;41:54;"Yeah. That was a huge tour."
41:54;41:58;"And I would say if fans out there are interested in exploring the dead,"
41:58;42:01;"check out American Beauty, which is a great studio record,"
42:01;42:05;"and then check out Europe 72, which is a live record."
42:05;42:08;"All right, well, let's check out some of that live Grateful Dead"
42:08;42:11;"everybody's always talking about. Here's ""Jack Straw,"" live in Paris."

43:42;43:46;"So Alec, you make an interesting point as we went on that journey"
43:46;43:49;"that Grateful Dead going on tour in '72, that's not that different."
43:49;43:52;"than Hardfest in Pomona, 2015."
43:52;43:58;"Right, the Grateful Dead fans, it's like a very serious drug culture."
43:58;44:03;"The parking lots at those shows are where you get the best drugs in the world,"
44:03;44:07;"like any type of, well, mostly psychedelics."
44:07;44:11;"Deadheads are like, at least in my experience, very passionate people"
44:11;44:15;"and they have these sort of intense feelings about the drugs"
44:15;44:19;"and the care in which they take procuring the best drugs"
44:19;44:22;"and making sure everyone's okay and whatever."
44:22;44:26;"In the EDM world, there's what, Plur?"
44:26;44:27;"What's Plur?"
44:27;44:30;"Peace, love, unity and something with an R."
44:30;44:33;"But it's kind of nice to maybe realize that things haven't changed that much."
44:33;44:37;"Yeah, you got bands, you got drug bands. We still got drug bands."
44:37;44:42;"Yeah, I mean, I'm not even drawing a comparative, qualitative judgment,"
44:42;44:47;"but it does seem like the deadhead scene was a lot about the drugs"
44:47;44:49;"and then a lot about the tunes."
44:49;44:55;"And just as an outside observer, it seems like rave/EDM vibe is like drugs"
44:55;44:57;"and the scene and the music."
44:57;44:59;"Sex, also."
44:59;45:03;"Sure, and then the music is like a distant fourth."
45:03;45:05;"Or the specifics of the music."
45:05;45:08;"Or are they like, oh, so-and-so's-- I don't know."
45:08;45:12;"But we're talking about EDM, we're not talking about like a blank band"
45:12;45:15;"that has this distinct culture following it."
45:15;45:17;"Right, maybe there is no one--"
45:17;45:21;"it's hard to have this monolithic thing like the Grateful Dead today."
45:21;45:23;"Well, Insane Clown Posse, maybe."
45:23;45:25;"Maybe Insane Clown Posse is the closest that we have."
45:25;45:28;"Second reference on this episode, strong."

54:48;54:49;"Nice to see you."
54:49;54:50;"I'm happy to be here. It's nice to see you too."
54:50;54:51;"It's been a while."
54:51;54:52;"Yeah."
54:52;54:56;"Last time I saw you was in New York for the rap party for your movie."
54:56;54:57;"Yes, ""Cocoa."""
54:57;54:58;"Can we talk about the movie a little bit?"
54:58;54:59;"Sure."
54:59;55:00;"So what is it?"
55:00;55:11;"The movie is a film about a young girl named Cocoa, and she's a student in college,"
55:11;55:16;"but she's also trying to figure out this rap career with these guys that she goes to high school with."
55:16;55:21;"She comes from a bit of a middle class family."
55:21;55:24;"The father's died, and the mom really wants her to go back to school,"
55:24;55:31;"but she's set on figuring out this rap career and becoming this famous rapper with these guys in this group."
55:31;55:38;"And the mom finally forces her to go back to school, and when she's enrolled in this school,"
55:38;55:44;"she gets into this poetry class thinking that, you know, she's like, ""Oh, this is just something I'm just going to breeze through."""
55:44;55:53;"But she gets into the poetry class, and she meets this teacher who just kind of turns her view of hip-hop"
55:53;55:57;"and just view of rapping and art all inside out."
55:57;55:59;"So the whole movie is basically--"
55:59;56:01;"And who is the teacher? Who plays the teacher?"
56:01;56:02;"I don't want to give too much away."
56:02;56:04;"Oh, really? But isn't the cast is not public?"
56:04;56:07;"Well, okay. I got it. So the teacher is Jill Scott."
56:07;56:08;"Okay."
56:08;56:11;"So there's a lot of that in the movie of me and her, like, you know, going back and forth,"
56:11;56:14;"and she's just teaching me a thing or two."
56:14;56:19;"And, yeah, so the whole premise of the movie is just rap versus spoken word,"
56:19;56:25;"which is really interesting because I was just kind of--I don't know, not to be like, ""Oh, like, ooh, poetry,"" you know,"
56:25;56:32;"like, ""I don't like poetry,"" but I guess I was just really unaware of this huge spoken word scene."
56:32;56:35;"And, you know, that's really big and really actually thriving,"
56:35;56:39;"and I was really, you know, surprised to actually enjoy a lot of it."
56:39;56:42;"So now I'm into spoken word."
56:42;56:43;"And it's directed by RZA?"
56:43;56:45;"Directed by RZA."
56:45;56:46;"Is he cool?"
56:46;56:47;"RZA's mad cool."
56:47;56:48;"You've known him before?"
56:48;56:49;"No."
56:49;56:50;"You like Wu-Tang?"
56:50;56:51;"Yeah."
56:51;56:54;"So, Azalea, so far today we've been spending a lot of time with Jake."
56:54;56:57;"I'd like to introduce you to Jake Longstreth. He's a painter."
56:57;57:00;"He's been teaching us a bit about Grateful Dead."
57:00;57:01;"Oh, cool."
57:01;57:02;"Are you a Grateful Dead fan at all?"
57:02;57:04;"Not really, no."
57:04;57:05;"But you're kind of a rock fan."
57:05;57:06;"Yeah."
57:06;57:08;"What rock bands do you like?"
57:08;57:11;"I like The Doors, and I like--"
57:11;57:12;"Interesting."
57:12;57:14;"We were talking some trash about The Doors earlier."
57:14;57:16;"I like this band called Stories."
57:16;57:17;"What's that?"
57:17;57:19;"They're kind of like a prog rock band."
57:19;57:21;"I like all kinds of rock, but I really like prog rock."
57:21;57:24;"I like kind of like Broadway-style rock."
57:24;57:25;"Is it like Yes, or--?"
57:25;57:27;"It's like a Queen vibe."
57:27;57:28;"Okay."
57:28;57:29;"Hello, Queen? That's tight."
57:29;57:31;"It's dope. Maybe you can listen to some of it later."
57:31;57:33;"Let's listen to some of the Stories."
57:33;57:34;"What's your favorite Stories song?"
57:34;57:36;"I'll play it to you right now."

01:12:47;01:12:50;"Azalea, are you a Lenny Kravitz fan?"
01:12:50;01:12:54;"- I couldn't say that I'm exactly a Lenny Kravitz fan."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"I don't dislike Lenny Kravitz."

01:13:19;01:13:21;"- All the people in the Bronx that got Legionnaires' disease?"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"- Yeah, I heard like five or six people have Legionnaires' disease,"

01:13:24;01:13:27;"- No, I read like 70 people got it and like five or six people died."

01:13:29;01:13:31;"- So what's the story? Tell us about it."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"- Legionnaires' disease is, I guess, it's a sort of--"
01:13:34;01:13:38;"I think the name Legionnaires' disease comes from--"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"because when they first discovered this bacteria,"
01:13:41;01:13:46;"it's like a certain sort of bacteria that lives in cooling units,"
01:13:46;01:13:50;"you know, like central air or air conditioners and stuff like that."
01:13:50;01:13:55;"And there was some Legion conference, some shit happened,"
01:13:55;01:13:58;"and that's where they found it, so it got the name Legionnaires' disease."
01:13:58;01:14:03;"But it's like some sort of water-based bacteria."
01:14:03;01:14:06;"- Right, so they said it's not contagious, but you get it from the water source."
01:14:06;01:14:10;"- You can get it from the source, but it's not like, you know, people--"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"you can't like pass it from person to person."

01:32:53;01:32:54;">> We really like Meek Mill."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Meek Mill is hot."
01:32:55;01:32:56;">> I love Meek Mill."
01:32:56;01:32:57;">> Okay, no, but I just want to say something."
01:32:57;01:33:02;"I play devil's advocate with that line because I think we all agree."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"You said that was a line that like everybody said was really, you know."
01:33:05;01:33:06;">> It's a standout line."
01:33:06;01:33:07;">> It was just well crafted."
01:33:07;01:33:09;"It was crafted really well."
01:33:09;01:33:10;">> It's a well crafted line."
01:33:10;01:33:15;"The other day, I was, literally yesterday, I was talking with one of my coworkers at the"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"office who said."
01:33:16;01:33:20;">> Well, I have been working in an office."
01:33:20;01:33:22;">> Arguably, world and girl don't rhyme."
01:33:22;01:33:23;">> It don't matter."
01:33:23;01:33:24;">> No, it doesn't matter."
01:33:24;01:33:26;">> It's not even about that."
01:33:26;01:33:27;">> It's not about that."
01:33:27;01:33:31;">> It's not even, man, things are so much easier when we're just talking about Rachel"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"Platt and Fight Song."
01:33:32;01:33:33;">> All right, let's do it."
01:33:33;01:33:38;">> This is what my coworker said that they thought that line was sexist."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"And I immediately said, I don't think it's sexist."
01:33:41;01:33:46;"And he said, well, because it's implying that he should be embarrassed that he's opening"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"for a woman."
01:33:47;01:33:49;"And I said, oh, I didn't interpret the line that way."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"I think he was not saying you should be embarrassed that you're opening for a woman."
01:33:52;01:33:54;"He was just saying that you're getting a free ride."
01:33:54;01:33:55;">> Exactly."
01:33:55;01:33:56;">> Do you think it's sexist?"
01:33:56;01:33:58;">> No, it's not sexist."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"He's basically just saying you're getting a free ride."
01:34:00;01:34:05;">> I think it is sexist because it's saying you're getting a free ride from a woman, which"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"is like insult to injury."
01:34:06;01:34:11;"You should be, like, if it was like Dr. Dre took him on tour and he was like, is that"
01:34:11;01:34:15;"your tour or Dr. Dre's tour, you loser?"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"That'd be one thing, but instead he's like, that's your girl's tour."
01:34:18;01:34:20;">> No, I didn't take it that way."
01:34:20;01:34:26;"And I don't think that Drake would come for Nicki Minaj in that way."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"I think he respects her enough as an entity."
01:34:29;01:34:33;"You know how people like to get on, like, I do it all the time."
01:34:33;01:34:39;"People love to get upset about things and just flesh their thoughts out."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"People love to overanalyze things."
01:34:41;01:34:44;">> But are you saying you love to get upset or you get passionate about things?"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"You don't love to get upset, do you?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;">> No, that's what I mean."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"I get passionate about things."
01:34:48;01:34:56;"Yeah, no, I think with as many songs as Drake has written about women and like submitting"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"to women, I don't think that there's any sort of..."
01:34:59;01:35:01;">> Well, the article addresses that actually."
01:35:01;01:35:03;">> Yeah, I haven't read the whole article yet."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"I was getting people just telling me lines."
01:35:05;01:35:06;">> My thing is..."
01:35:06;01:35:07;">> You can read it later."
01:35:07;01:35:08;">> My thing is just like, OK, whatever."
01:35:08;01:35:12;"Whoever swung first, ya swung, now it's fighting."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"And you know, Drake got more hits in."
01:35:15;01:35:19;">> But I think we should also talk about the fact that I think the elephant in the room"
01:35:19;01:35:26;"is a lot of the biggest rappers have collaborators when it comes to writing lyrics."
01:35:26;01:35:28;"Arguably all of the biggest rappers."
01:35:28;01:35:29;"Is that fair to say?"
01:35:29;01:35:30;">> And I don't think anyone cares."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"I think everyone..."
01:35:31;01:35:32;">> Yeah, nobody seems to care."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"I just want to say that if I was Meek Mill, I would release a diss track and I would say"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Meek Mill..."
01:35:37;01:35:38;">> I mean, he did."
01:35:38;01:35:41;">> No, no, but I'm saying I would release another diss track and I would put out the"
01:35:41;01:35:47;"MP3 on SoundCloud or whatever and say Meek Mill, extra charged up would be the title"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"and then you hit play and it's just Rachel Platten fight song."
01:35:50;01:35:54;"OK, there's a lot to talk about."
01:35:54;01:35:56;"This was kind of an interesting week for the top five."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"Are you guys ready for the number one song on iTunes right now?"
01:35:59;01:36:00;">> Yes."
01:36:00;01:36:04;">> This is called ""Drag Me Down"" by One Direction."
01:36:42;01:36:43;">> So we're here with One Direction with ""Drag Me Down."""
01:36:43;01:36:46;"I think this is a first lesson for all of us."
01:36:46;01:36:47;"Let's start with Jake."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"Jake, do you know who One Direction is?"
01:36:49;01:36:50;">> Vaguely, I'm aware of it."
01:36:50;01:36:54;"It's like a boy band that was like vaguely kind of indie or rock or something."
01:36:54;01:36:56;">> It's pop, pop music."
01:36:56;01:36:59;">> Yeah, it's like Backstreet Boys but like slightly updated."
01:36:59;01:37:03;">> You're right, and One Direction uses like a lot of rock textures in their music from"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"what I know."
01:37:04;01:37:09;">> More so than the boy bands from 15 years ago or something."
01:37:09;01:37:10;">> Yeah, exactly."
01:37:10;01:37:12;">> I think that's kind of just where rock's at these days."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"So what do you think?"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Have you heard any of their songs before?"
01:37:14;01:37:15;">> Not really."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"I mean maybe--"
01:37:16;01:37:17;">> You think you would recognize any of them?"
01:37:17;01:37:18;">> No."
01:37:18;01:37:19;">> Can you name a single member?"
01:37:19;01:37:20;">> No."
01:37:20;01:37:21;">> Have you ever heard the name Harry Styles?"
01:37:21;01:37:22;">> No."
01:37:22;01:37:23;">> Zayn Malik?"
01:37:23;01:37:24;">> No."
01:37:24;01:37:25;">> Malik."
01:37:25;01:37:26;">> So what do you think of the song, man?"
01:37:26;01:37:31;">> I mean similar to the fight song thing, like the songwriting is sort of whatever."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"If Elvis sang it, it'd probably be great."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"[Laughter]"
01:37:36;01:37:39;">> Or like if a good singer with a sense of personality--"
01:37:39;01:37:40;">> Maybe Jerry Garcia?"
01:37:40;01:37:41;">> Yeah."
01:37:41;01:37:43;"Then it might be good."
01:37:43;01:37:44;"I don't know."
01:37:44;01:37:50;"I mean I think the performances are just so generic and there's no personality."
01:37:50;01:37:56;"I mean that's what I like, you know, when someone knows who they are and are doing it."
01:37:56;01:37:57;">> I don't know, man."
01:37:57;01:37:58;"This was a difficult trip through the top five."
01:37:58;01:38:01;"Maybe it's because we're out in L.A. or something, but this just brought up all sorts of emotions"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"for me."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"I didn't like fighting with you guys about Rachel Platten."
01:38:05;01:38:06;">> Are you okay?"
01:38:06;01:38:08;">> Yeah, this was a tough one, honestly."
01:38:08;01:38:11;"But I just want to shout out everybody in the top five and of course Lenny Kravitz."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"This has been a very interesting week."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Now that we're out of the top five--"
01:38:14;01:38:16;">> Let me play a song."
01:38:16;01:38:17;">> Azealia wants to play a song."
01:38:17;01:38:20;"We ceremonially hand the aux cord to Azealia."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"She's plugging it into her iPhone Plus."
01:38:22;01:38:25;"[Explosion]"
01:38:42;01:39:11;"[Singing]"
01:39:21;01:39:41;"[Singing]"
01:40:01;01:40:11;"[Singing]"
01:40:21;01:40:41;"[Singing]"
01:41:41;01:41:51;"[Singing]"
01:46:51;01:47:00;"[Singing]"
01:47:10;01:47:20;"[Singing]"
01:52:10;01:52:16;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"Volume three of Time Crisis is now coming to a close."
01:52:19;01:52:21;"Clearly the best episode yet."
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Every episode we get better and better."
01:52:23;01:52:29;"We've silenced the haters over this month, which feels amazing."
01:52:29;01:52:32;"I think we were really lucky to get this crew together today."
01:52:32;01:52:35;"I'm so happy that we're all in LA at the same time."
01:52:35;01:52:40;"Jake Longstreth, a visual artist, one of my favorite painters."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"Probably people should just go to your website, jakelongstreth.com, right?"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"Or just Google Jake Longstreth."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Jake has a very unique style as a painter."
01:52:47;01:52:50;"I think once you see a couple, you'll immediately recognize it."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"And he's definitely doing something vital with the art form."
01:52:53;01:52:57;"Azalea, I'm so happy that we were in LA at the same time and that you come through."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Will you come back when we're back in New York?"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"Thank you for having me, and yes, I will come back."
01:53:02;01:53:05;"Great. That would be wonderful."
01:53:05;01:53:09;"And also very lucky that Despot happened to be in LA."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"Just kind of coming out here doing his thing."
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Thanks for coming through, man."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"You're welcome."
01:53:14;01:53:18;"Cousin Asher, we won't forget you. We'll see you when we get home."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Never forget Cousin Asher."
01:53:20;01:53:23;"We'll never forget Cousin Asher. Hope everything's all right."
01:53:23;01:53:27;"So we want to leave you with one last song."
