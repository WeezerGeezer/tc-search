00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back again. We have so much more to unpack when it comes to Travis Scott, McDonald's,"
00:06;00:15;"and modern existence. We also dig into the Rolling Stone Top 500 albums of all time. All that,"
00:15;00:26;"plus a little bit of floating dock, down by the river, country music. This is Time Crisis"
00:26;00:32;"with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:23;"Time Crisis back once again, and we're jumping right in because there's so much happening in"
01:23;01:30;"the TC universe. One of which is, if you recall, if you're an avid listener, at the end of the last"
01:30;01:35;"episode, Seinfeld did a deep dive for us about the whole Travis Scott, McDonald's thing. That was"
01:35;01:42;"actually one time, I think, TC was neither way ahead of the curve nor way behind. I feel like"
01:42;01:49;"we were actually like a surfer, perfectly. Like friend of the show, Kyle Field, Little Wings,"
01:49;01:54;"we were in repose on the board, just at the perfect moment, just in tune with nature. Because"
01:54;02:02;"I feel like the burger had just hit, and I felt the whole two weeks since, all I saw in my feeds,"
02:02;02:08;"my various feeds were non-stop Travis Scott, McDonald's stuff. I feel like a lot of the jokes"
02:08;02:13;"in Seinfeld, you know the most about memes here. Is this a correct interpretation? I feel like a"
02:13;02:21;"lot of the memes were about like dorky white kids going to McDonald's and being like, ""Cactus Jack"
02:21;02:28;"sent me!"" Is that, was that like a dominant part of the discourse? I feel like that was a definitely"
02:28;02:34;"like a TikTok trend for a minute. Because I'll tell you that in McDonald's press releases and"
02:34;02:41;"in their campaign, they used phrases like, ""Tell them Cactus Jack sent you!"" and ""It's lit!"" which"
02:41;02:47;"is like popular slang from like three years ago, four years ago. And I think that, yeah, the kids"
02:47;02:52;"you're describing found this very funny and would kind of go to drive-thrus. There are videos of"
02:52;02:57;"like guys rolling up at drive-thrus, you know, harassing McDonald's employees and being like,"
02:57;03:03;"""It's lit! Cactus Jack sent me!"" You know, on the other end you have the like harried McDonald's"
03:03;03:07;"workers being like, like there's one where the guy is like, ""Oh we're not playing around here,"
03:07;03:12;"like, like what do you want?"" kind of thing. Like not taking that nonsense from those kids. So yeah,"
03:12;03:17;"it was definitely like a meme on that level. You know what, young man? I've been on my feet for 12"
03:17;03:23;"hours surrounded by the bizarre fumes of the McDonald's kitchen in this hot little box."
03:23;03:28;"It is far from lit. And also, Seinfeld, you've been keeping us abreast on the time crisis text"
03:28;03:34;"thread. It does feel in a large sense like the things that we've been talking about for years"
03:34;03:39;"on the program, it's like reaching some kind of climax now. Just things that would have seemed"
03:39;03:45;"like an absurd joke, it's like beyond parody now. Because even the time, you know, there's always"
03:45;03:50;"been celebrity endorsements, right? And I feel like the kind of big musician, the Michael Jacksons,"
03:50;03:56;"the Reba McEntires, I feel like she was on a bag of Fritos once. It's not unprecedented."
03:56;04:02;"But what's weird about it is just like the endless drops. Because you were sending us like,"
04:02;04:09;"was it McRib shorts? Yeah, that was the Lonnie's dad shorts. The McRib shorts. It was kind of"
04:09;04:14;"absurd when we first talked about this two weeks ago. I was like stunned at how many different"
04:14;04:19;"pieces of merchandise they were hawking through this collection. And what I didn't realize at"
04:19;04:25;"the time was that that was just week one of a series. I think it was three or four weeks of"
04:25;04:32;"drops. So we're talking like around 200 different pieces of novelty Travis Scott merchandise."
04:32;04:38;"I can picture just like, we're old as f***. We're on our deathbeds, very old men. And we're just"
04:38;04:43;"like flick on the hardwired Neuralink TV in our brains. And just kind of see this image of like,"
04:44;04:52;"I am Travis Scott the third. When my grandfather began the collab with McDonald's in 2020,"
04:52;04:57;"the world was in disarray. Thank you, President Barron Trump for declaring."
04:57;05:02;"Like at that point, McDonald's no longer serves food."
05:02;05:12;"They only sell Travis Scott merch. Burgers were outlawed during President Ocasio-Cortez's first"
05:12;05:20;"year. Right. And I mean, it's so hyper specific, like the copy on the merch is like, I ordered the"
05:20;05:27;"Travis Scott McMeal at McDonald's September 8th to October 4th, 2020. You could really buy like"
05:27;05:34;"a memento of purchasing a McDonald's meal on a shirt. That's the shirt in particular that feels"
05:34;05:40;"one step beyond. Because also it costs like 80 bucks or something. An $80 long sleeve that just"
05:40;05:49;"says, I went to McDonald's and then the dates of the Travis Scott run. Jake, it's funny,"
05:49;05:55;"this idea of McDonald's just becoming Travis Scott merch stores, because it makes me think about"
05:55;05:58;"this is like the type of headline I remember seeing. And I was like, I don't even want to"
05:58;06:03;"click on it. But it was like about all these abandoned malls becoming Amazon fulfillment"
06:03;06:09;"centers. Perfect. I think there's just something about watching the transition from like one kind"
06:09;06:14;"of buff thing to another buff thing. Yeah, it's either going to be mega churches or Amazon"
06:14;06:19;"fulfillment centers. There's nothing about that that feels like positive urban renewal, where it's"
06:19;06:25;"like, oh, hell yeah. All these malls are centrally located in dense population centers. And a lot of"
06:25;06:29;"them are sitting empty because people don't do retail anymore. And now they're finally coming"
06:29;06:36;"back to life as Amazon fulfillment centers. You're just like, oh, man, we're just zigzagging around a"
06:36;06:43;"weird, uncomfortable existence. How crazy is that? We're just saying the term fulfillment center"
06:43;06:48;"with no irony. It's very physical release center. Get your physical release at the fulfillment"
06:48;06:55;"center. It's like a 2020 Billy Joel song. Anthony worked at the fulfillment center."
06:55;07:02;"Have you guys seen those Amazon fulfillment trucks, the delivery trucks? No, I think."
07:03;07:08;"I saw one on the street the other day because Amazon has their own fleet of trucks. And it was"
07:08;07:14;"like military grade, like a futuristic Brinks truck. It was like this cold sort of dark gray"
07:14;07:21;"color. And it had the Amazon logo with that arrow smile. It didn't make me feel good to see. I'll"
07:21;07:27;"put it that way. We're grasping in the dark here. We got from one weird version of the future to"
07:27;07:32;"another weird version and all the former McDonald's that are now full time. Travis Scott,"
07:32;07:37;"merch stores that'll actually be like the last stand of like humans. And Travis Scott,"
07:37;07:44;"the third will be like my grandfather's dying words were never let the Travis Scott McDonald's"
07:44;07:50;"merch empire become fully automated. We make these make rib shorts for people and they should be sold"
07:50;07:57;"by people. And then it's like this weird war of like the RoboCop, the Amazon RoboCops versus just"
07:57;08:02;"like the flesh and blood. Actually, that's a weird thing. I'm sure people have drawn this comparison"
08:02;08:06;"before. Everything's like brick and mortar versus online. But brick and mortar has a real resonance"
08:06;08:12;"with the phrase flesh and blood, brick and mortar, flesh and blood, brick and blood."
08:12;08:18;"It's not enough for a store to exist, IRL, because there's these Amazon stores that nobody even works"
08:18;08:24;"at. A true old school 20th century store has to be brick and blood where it's made out of bricks."
08:25;08:30;"Yeah. Also like a new cocktail bar in Brooklyn is brick and blood,"
08:30;08:36;"flesh and mortar. Wait, Seinfeld, are there people posting pictures of themselves wearing"
08:36;08:42;"the McRib shorts or the long sleeve? It says you bought the Travis Scott meal during this window"
08:42;08:48;"of time. So my understanding is that those merch products do not ship for something ridiculous like"
08:48;08:55;"12 weeks. So I don't think anybody's actually like put their hands on one yet."
08:55;09:00;"Last time I whipped around, last time I did the whippers, last time I live reverse,"
09:00;09:04;"Porter Brown hit the reverend, last time I hit your crib, last time it went no tennis. I didn't"
09:04;09:09;"win back in my cell, felt like hell, I risked it, pace yourself, how you living? No, you thrilling,"
09:09;09:15;"off the scene, how I got my choice in penance back in the street. Roll this vial, let it be,"
09:15;09:21;"rage is out, gotta eat. Not if I run away with the sound, by the way, count it down by the days."
09:21;09:26;"And myself, no, they forget with the moves, I'm drunk off the juice, no, I'm drunk, I be smooth"
09:26;09:32;"and I lose it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, nah. Part of the reason that obviously there's so much to talk"
09:32;09:38;"about with the Travis Scott, McDonald's collab, I think we might look back on that as kind of"
09:38;09:43;"more than the election of Trump, more than the, you know, founding of Facebook in 2004."
09:43;09:49;"This might be one of these like hardcore before and after moments in terms of American history,"
09:49;09:54;"global history, corporate food history. But anyway, with all this discussion, as we were"
09:54;10:01;"on the TC text thread, looking at some of the new merch items, Jake made a bombshell revelation."
10:01;10:05;"Actually, can somebody pull it up and see verbatim? Yeah, this was after Seinfeld sent us"
10:05;10:11;"an image of the McRib shorts, which doesn't get more TC. And then there was like a weird phrase"
10:11;10:16;"on the McRib shorts that caught my eye. And then I really dropped the bomb after that."
10:17;10:23;"Seinfeld, I'm going to need a Travis Scott primer because it didn't come up last episode,"
10:23;10:25;"but I have no idea who Travis Scott is."
10:25;10:34;"When you say you have no idea who he is, I mean, you know, more or less what genre of music"
10:34;10:39;"he's in. I honestly don't. I don't know if he's a DJ or a rapper. I'm guessing one of the two."
10:39;10:43;"Okay. He wasn't even in the top five before. Like we played Travis Scott."
10:44;10:51;"Well, I don't really pay that close attention. Didn't we have an hour and a half runner of like"
10:51;10:56;"back to the future Travis Scott, like an entire fanfic about this?"
10:56;11:00;"Oh, right. That was a while ago. Well, but I guess again, you could participate in that"
11:00;11:04;"kind of story without knowing that all you know is that this is a youngish famous person."
11:04;11:08;"Right. And I honestly, I'm like 50 50 on whether he's a rapper or a DJ."
11:08;11:11;"How come not a country dude? Travis Scott sounds like a country guy."
11:12;11:17;"That's true. I saw like an image of him on stage at what looked like a large"
11:17;11:21;"festival, which made me think maybe he's a DJ. He's a rapper. I mean, it's very possible."
11:21;11:24;"Okay. He has DJ, but yeah,"
11:24;11:29;"the simplest way to describe them. Obviously he wears many hats as a rapper. He was famously in"
11:29;11:33;"a relationship with another famous person. They have a child. I guess they're not together anymore."
11:33;11:40;"Do you have any idea who, who his former partner was? No. Do you know who Kylie Jenner is?"
11:40;11:44;"Yeah. I mean, I've heard the name. I know that she's Kim Kardashian's sister."
11:44;11:46;"Oh yeah. All right. Half sister."
11:46;11:50;"Is she the person that was the youngest billionaire for like having like a handbag?"
11:50;11:52;"Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah."
11:52;11:53;"Okay. Not even look at me."
11:53;11:55;"Close. Wow. Okay. Makeup, makeup line, right?"
11:55;11:58;"Yeah. Makeup. She does lip stuff."
11:58;12:00;"So, you know, she's an entrepreneur."
12:00;12:04;"Yeah. So two entrepreneurs in that relationship."
12:04;12:07;"I guess my question is sort of like, so Travis Scott is a rapper. Great."
12:08;12:14;"What is specific about him that makes McDonald's want to team up? Why not any number of rappers?"
12:14;12:17;"That's a really good question. I feel Seinfeld. You could feel that the best."
12:17;12:21;"Well, I mean, definitely. I don't know if it's any more complicated than"
12:21;12:28;"Travis Scott just being sort of, you know, one of the most popular rap artists of the time. And,"
12:28;12:34;"you know, I remember when I was prepping for the McDonald's conversation, there was a quote from"
12:34;12:39;"somebody at McDonald's who said that they were having trouble connecting with Gen Z."
12:39;12:44;"And so Travis Scott was sort of this collaboration was one way to reach out to them."
12:44;12:46;"I bet they paid him an ungodly sum."
12:46;12:47;"For sure."
12:47;12:53;"Which is a step beyond princely. He didn't merely get a princely sum. He got an ungodly sum because"
12:53;12:58;"if I was at McDonald's, I admire that they went for it. But especially because as we've discussed,"
12:58;13:04;"the thing itself, the Travis Scott meal cost McDonald's literally nothing. Maybe a tiny bit"
13:04;13:09;"of like extra barbecue sauce production or something. But it's like everything's there"
13:09;13:09;"already."
13:09;13:15;"They were already doing the breakfast 24 hours. So the bacon's already available."
13:15;13:18;"They got the bacon, they got everything there."
13:18;13:19;"And you see right."
13:19;13:23;"And they got the Sprite on deck. So I'm sure without having to spend any money on that stuff,"
13:23;13:28;"and then the merch stuff pays for itself. It's almost like a life or death thing. Like you give"
13:28;13:34;"Travis Scott $50 million. And if that makes a huge dent in terms of us connecting with a whole"
13:34;13:41;"generation, creating a new kind of like loyal McDonald's customer worth it. Easy $100 million."
13:41;13:46;"It's probably somewhere in between. Maybe it's more like 30 or 40, but just like an insane amount"
13:46;13:47;"of money."
13:47;13:47;"Wow."
13:47;13:53;"And I think also part of it, Jake is that he is the most popular rapper. I just thought of like"
13:53;13:58;"a way to describe him, I think. And I'm fairly out of the loop as well, because Travis Scott"
13:58;14:03;"seems to really resonate. I mean, he's good. He's good. I've seen him perform live. We probably"
14:03;14:08;"played five festivals last summer where we played right before Travis Scott."
14:08;14:08;"No way."
14:08;14:14;"Including in Poland. So I saw his show like a few times and it's like, he's a great performer,"
14:14;14:19;"super high energy, just already a huge catalog of hits, a lot of really good songs,"
14:20;14:25;"interesting visuals and all that stuff. One way that I think might make sense to describe him is"
14:25;14:30;"if Kanye is Nirvana, he's Foo Fighters. Does this seem fair?"
14:30;14:35;"Out people who know Nick's what? No, that's Hey, you said that not me."
14:35;14:36;"I know I said it."
14:36;14:40;"First of all, Foo Fighters, Jake, you've admitted they have some great songs."
14:40;14:43;"I wouldn't say great. But yeah,"
14:43;14:47;"I think in terms of him being more populous. Do you know what I mean?"
14:47;14:54;"Well, and also like less chaotic to use an overused term Nirvana. I mean, I hate to say it,"
14:54;15:01;"but like, obviously Kurt Cobain was a troubled person, right? And there was something inherently"
15:01;15:07;"unstable about his relationship to fame. And so Nirvana, a lot of people might say there was like"
15:07;15:14;"a type of more originality, a passion or something compared to Foo Fighters, but also a type of like"
15:14;15:19;"chaos and a type of instability and suffering and, you know, the ups and downs of that kind of"
15:19;15:25;"artist. Whereas like, you know, Dave Grohl is a front man. He's had this very long,"
15:25;15:30;"successful career. I'm sure he learned a lot by like being in a band with somebody who,"
15:30;15:32;"you know, he watched somebody suffer like that. And they're probably,"
15:32;15:35;"and also probably just different people. But I think there's something similar about like"
15:35;15:42;"the Kanye ricocheting up and down and left and right in terms of the popular opinion and what"
15:42;15:47;"people make of him and whether people like him or don't like him and his world is full of chaos."
15:47;15:53;"And Travis Scott just kind of like real down the middle. And I'm not saying that his music is"
15:53;15:56;"boring and I don't think Foo Fighters music is boring either. Like I said, I think they have"
15:56;16:02;"great songs, but just like a kind of, I don't know, like a business acumen, a stability that"
16:02;16:06;"their predecessors didn't really have. - I mean, it totally makes sense. I mean,"
16:06;16:08;"Travis Scott's the one teaming up with McDonald's, not Kanye."
16:08;16:14;"- But not even with that. What I think might shed some light on it when quarantine started,"
16:14;16:22;"he started doing concerts in Fortnite, in the game. Like he saw, you know, that when you speak"
16:22;16:27;"of Gen Z, he was the one who said, you know, I'm going to connect with like all these young kids"
16:27;16:33;"that are playing this popular game. And I'm going to put on a concert in the game to Ezra's point."
16:33;16:40;"I think that's sort of a very, the business acumen and sort of marketing aspect of what he can do"
16:40;16:43;"is pretty impressive. - And I think in a way to"
16:43;16:48;"keep beating my dead horse of a metaphor, and again, I'm not trying to like compare the music"
16:48;16:54;"because I don't think that's fair, but there's a way in which the Foo Fighters and Travis Scott"
16:54;16:59;"delivered on a set of ideas that respectively Nirvana and Kanye put into the universe,"
17:00;17:06;"but in ways that were like unstable and ultimately chaotic. And I mean, obviously Kanye is doing fine,"
17:06;17:11;"you know, compared to Kurt Cobain who tragically took his life at such a young age. But like,"
17:11;17:18;"if Kurt Cobain was somebody who was really interested in, could he marry a type of like"
17:18;17:24;"punk rock idealism with an ambition? And you know, like, I think we've talked about this before."
17:24;17:29;"Have you ever looked through his old journals? They like published a book of them and it's like"
17:29;17:34;"him as a teenager through his twenties, just like little scribbles and lyrics and stuff."
17:34;17:36;"- Yeah. - There's like a page somewhere"
17:36;17:41;"where he's just like trying out logos and stuff, which is not dissimilar from stuff I've seen from"
17:41;17:44;"Michael Jackson. Like when you watch a Michael Jackson doc and there's like literally a page"
17:44;17:50;"from his notebook in like the early 80s where he's just like, ""Study Fred Astaire, never stop"
17:50;17:55;"practicing, sell 30 million albums,"" like visualizing a career path. And honestly, in the"
17:55;18:00;"Kurt Cobain journals, there's little hints of stuff like that too. A guy like Kurt Cobain,"
18:00;18:03;"probably on the one hand, he loved like the Melvins and..."
18:03;18:06;"- Beat happening. - Beat happening and the"
18:06;18:11;"raincoats and Daniel Johnston, like weird indie stuff. But there's no way that Kurt Cobain didn't"
18:11;18:16;"like Black Sabbath too and just like rock history stuff. You know, he might've had mixed feelings"
18:16;18:18;"about it, but I'm sure... - Creedence Clearwater."
18:18;18:21;"- Yeah, probably. - Yeah."
18:21;18:25;"- I mean, some people even think that he took ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" from Boston,"
18:25;18:34;"""More Than a Feeling."" And then, you know, people always talk about the pain and the confusion of"
18:34;18:39;"his success for him was like, ""Now there's these jocks in the audience. These are the people who"
18:39;18:43;"used to beat me up and I don't fuck with these guys."" You know, like, again, I don't know how"
18:43;18:48;"accurate this is, but that was the myth of Kurt Cobain, right? A sensitive guy who made this like"
18:48;18:53;"aggressive music that connected with everybody. And suddenly he's seeing the crowds full of,"
18:53;18:57;"or partially full of meatheads and he doesn't know how to reconcile all that."
18:57;19:01;"Because clearly he had split impulses. He wanted to be in a big successful rock band,"
19:01;19:07;"but he also was like a sensitive anti-establishment punk rocker. And then like the Foo Fighters,"
19:07;19:13;"you could say, was actually like a more stable synthesis. Dave Grohl ended up being a big,"
19:13;19:18;"long running successful band. You know, whether Foo Fighters music is as aggressive as Nirvana,"
19:18;19:24;"that's a matter of taste. But he's like, ""Let me go get Pat Smear."" Pat Smear was in the Germs,"
19:24;19:29;"right? So you know what I mean? In a sense, Dave Grohl is like, ""I can marry these things. Let me"
19:29;19:36;"find a great dude from an iconic punk band who never got his due as a guitarist. Let me marry"
19:36;19:42;"the Germs in a sense with like the Rolling Stones, a long running kind of business savvy rock band."""
19:42;19:48;"Like he put it together in a way that probably clearly didn't happen for Nirvana. And I think"
19:48;19:52;"in a way like Kanye, before Travis Scott was even making music, was out there talking about,"
19:52;19:57;"""I should be doing big collaborations with these big corporations. People look down on rappers."
19:57;20:02;"They should be delivering us these contracts that they give to other people."" And he made a lot of"
20:02;20:09;"good points, but because his public persona was so controversial, it took him a long time to get"
20:09;20:14;"to where he is. Whereas the Travis Scott's of the world, probably because of everything that Kanye"
20:14;20:19;"stirred up, can kind of slide in in a pretty calm way and just being like, ""Yes, McDonald's collab,"
20:19;20:24;"let's do it."" It makes sense that this is the moment. - That's fascinating. I mean, how long"
20:24;20:30;"has rap been a genre? Like 40 years or so? - Yes. Yeah. Just about. A little more."
20:30;20:36;"- Can you picture a time before this time where a major corporation like McDonald's would have"
20:36;20:43;"teamed up with a rapper? - Not like this. I actually remember I had a CD in the '90s. McDonald's used"
20:43;20:50;"to sell or give away CDs, and one was a compilation of hip hop. Let me see if I can find it, because"
20:50;20:53;"it's actually really good. - Wait, McDonald's used to have CDs?"
20:53;21:03;"- McDonald's made a CD that's called ""Hip Hop and Jazz"" from 1995. I could buy this CD on Amazon."
21:03;21:09;"I used one for 94 cents. It's a pretty good deal. Let me see if I can find the track list."
21:09;21:17;"But on the front already, it says that the CD has us three, Jazzmatazz, Diggable Planets,"
21:17;21:24;"the Soul Sonics, Joy, and Lonnie Gordon. I'm sure somebody listening who's a real '90s hip hop head"
21:24;21:28;"might be like, ""That's not that cool."" But even then, somebody at McDonald's was like, ""We should"
21:28;21:35;"make a CD that highlights the intersection of hip hop and jazz and sell it."" - Is Travis Scott the"
21:35;21:40;"first musician... I mean, I guess he's the first person they've done a big collaboration with since"
21:40;21:45;"Michael Jordan. Is he the first musician to straight up to do a huge collaboration like this?"
21:45;21:50;"- Maybe a huge collaboration. - You could kind of picture in the '70s,"
21:50;21:55;"maybe Kiss, but Kiss was maybe too dark and weird. - I'm sure we've probably got somebody listening"
21:55;22:00;"at home who's off the top of their head is thinking of all sorts of like, ""Well, actually,"
22:00;22:05;"McDonald's did a commercial with this rapper in 19..."" I'm sure there's examples, but I think"
22:05;22:10;"you're right. There's something about this that feels slightly new. And it might just be about"
22:10;22:16;"the fading fortunes of McDonald's, relatively speaking, that it's not just them like, ""Oh,"
22:16;22:22;"we could sell a CD, a hip hop CD to maybe show people we're down. We could do a commercial and"
22:22;22:27;"have some..."" There's something about this that actually feels like, and again, I assume he got"
22:27;22:33;"paid an ungodly sum, but there's a funny way in which this kind of feels like McDonald's like,"
22:33;22:37;"bowing before Travis Scott and saying, ""Please help us."" - Oh my god."
22:37;22:41;"- It's not like when Nike gives somebody a partnership. That's just what you do when you"
22:41;22:45;"become like a big athlete. You get a few offers and you go with Nike. It's like,"
22:45;22:50;"it's par for the course. There's something about this that does feel like it's bigger,"
22:50;22:55;"it's more in depth than any kind of just endorsement or commercial that I could think of."
22:55;23:01;"I get those goosebumps every time, yeah. You come around, yeah. You ease my mind,"
23:01;23:09;"you make everything feel fine. Worry 'bout those calls. I'm way too numb, yeah. It's way too dumb,"
23:09;23:16;"yeah. I get those goosebumps every time. I need that high, man. Throw that to the side, yeah."
23:16;23:24;"I get those goosebumps every time, yeah. When you not around, when you throw that to the side, yeah."
23:25;23:32;"I get those goosebumps every time, yeah. 713, through the 281, yeah, I'm riding. Why they on me?"
23:32;23:39;"Why they on me? I'm flying. Zipping low-key. I'm zipping low-key at Onyx. Find a rider."
23:39;23:46;"When I'm pulling up right beside you, pop star, Lil Mariah. When I text, keep game wireless."
23:46;23:51;"Throw a stack on the bar, but I know a stack which I had to took my own. She fall through plenty,"
23:51;23:58;"I ran all her Guineas, yeah. We at the top, though, right there off Dueney, yeah. Oh, no,"
23:58;24:05;"I can't fuck with y'all, yeah. When I'm with my squad, I cannot do no wrong, yeah. Saltzman in"
24:05;24:10;"the city, don't get misinformed, yeah. They gon' pull up on you, brr, brr, brr."
24:10;24:16;"I think part of also what's so remarkable about it, and maybe also we were always heading in this"
24:16;24:24;"place in terms of, you know, late capitalism, collab culture, society of the spectacle,"
24:24;24:30;"post-modernism. I'm talking about things I only half understand now, but one thing I do understand"
24:30;24:35;"is that for the past 50 years, there have been a lot of people talking about the way our culture"
24:35;24:42;"has changed and how everything's mediated by images and spectacles and, you know, what's"
24:42;24:48;"that phrase some people use, like pseudo events, kind of post-truth, post-modern world that we live"
24:48;24:52;"in, we're all familiar with, which has only been exacerbated by social media. But there's something"
24:52;24:56;"funny about this, especially where it's like, we've talked about the Arch Deluxe on the show"
24:56;25:03;"before, right? Yes. So just to recap for anybody listening who somehow doesn't remember the Arch"
25:03;25:08;"Deluxe is, that was in the late 90s, McDonald's launched a new burger called the Arch Deluxe,"
25:08;25:13;"and they poured millions and millions of dollars into researching it, developing it, and then"
25:13;25:19;"marketing it because they felt like they needed a new burger to get more grownups in, kind of the"
25:19;25:24;"opposite of this. They needed a burger that felt a little classier, a little more elegant, it had a"
25:24;25:31;"big fat tomato on it. It's hilarious to think like some marketing firm or research group paid like"
25:31;25:35;"$20 million and they came back and they're just like, ""Hey, McDonald's, we just realized something."""
25:35;25:40;"They're like, ""What? None of your burgers got a big fat tomato slice on it. Your regular burger"
25:40;25:45;"has all this weird chopped up s***. Big Mac is like shredded lettuce and goo. What a grownup"
25:45;25:50;"associates with a burger is a slice of tomato."" I mean, they're saying to McDonald's, ""Hey,"
25:50;25:56;"can you like up the standards of your sourcing a little bit?"" Right. Because like to have a big"
25:56;26:01;"slab of tomato, you need to have like nice ass tomatoes. And I'm sure that's like an insane"
26:01;26:05;"investment for them because it's like suddenly they need a whole new distribution network."
26:05;26:11;"Wait, does a regular McDonald's burger literally not have tomato on it, just ketchup?"
26:11;26:11;"Like the handle?"
26:11;26:12;"The pickle."
26:12;26:14;"Yeah, it has pickles and chopped up onions."
26:14;26:15;"No tomatoes."
26:15;26:17;"No tomatoes on a Big Mac?"
26:17;26:18;"No."
26:18;26:19;"Okay, it's just shredded lettuce."
26:19;26:20;"Wow."
26:20;26:21;"Shredded lettuce, no tomatoes."
26:21;26:26;"If you have tomatoes, you need to have your staff slicing tomatoes like in the morning."
26:27;26:32;"Like normally, I think everything McDonald's would come in like vacuum sealed bags that you just open."
26:32;26:34;"It would just kill the margins is what you're saying."
26:34;26:38;"It would kill the margins and slow down their famously fast process."
26:38;26:42;"Yeah, you need to like have a guy slicing tomatoes for two hours in the morning."
26:42;26:47;"Or every location would need some special tomato slicing machine that costs $8,000."
26:47;26:54;"Yeah, McDonald's not f***ing with tomato slices, even though go to any backyard barbecue,"
26:54;26:59;"there's often going to be a plate with some slices of American cheese, onions and tomato."
26:59;27:02;"It is very much part of the American burger experience."
27:02;27:07;"But yeah, like you said, suddenly it's like we want tomatoes and McDonald's is like,"
27:07;27:10;"literally, they're talking to the Seinfeld 2000 of McDonald's."
27:10;27:12;"The CEO is just like, let me get a number crunch."
27:12;27:18;"And he's just like, we're looking at $89 million for the first year, sir."
27:18;27:22;"And he's like, can you amortize that over a decade if the Arch Deluxe is a hit?"
27:22;27:23;"Okay, then we're in the black, sir."
27:24;27:30;"Because yeah, like it's like the new trucking routes, having to go find the farms and like,"
27:30;27:35;"sir, I don't know, it's going to be tough in the Dakotas to get like, to get the Arch Deluxe."
27:35;27:36;"It's like, all right, whatever."
27:36;27:39;"It was a lot of money to reach a new audience."
27:39;27:45;"Just for the record, the full Arch Deluxe makeup, the ingredients were a quarter pound of beef on"
27:45;27:48;"a split top potato flour sesame seed bun."
27:48;27:49;"So that's like a different bun."
27:49;27:50;"A new bun."
27:51;27:58;"New bun topped with a circular piece of peppered bacon, leaf lettuce, tomato, American cheese,"
27:58;28:02;"onions, ketchup, and a secret mustard and mayonnaise sauce."
28:02;28:04;"That's a new sauce."
28:04;28:06;"Imagine the guy pitching that and you work in accounting."
28:06;28:09;"You're about to vomit when you hear all that stuff."
28:09;28:11;"How great would it have been?"
28:11;28:15;"I'm sorry, but how great would it have been if when they were saying to Travis Scott,"
28:15;28:20;"all right, we're there, deals basically close or the final yard line, they said,"
28:20;28:20;"all right, what do you want?"
28:20;28:22;"I want a Sprite."
28:22;28:23;"Great."
28:23;28:24;"Sprite instead of Coke."
28:24;28:26;"Sprite instead of Coke."
28:26;28:26;"Great."
28:26;28:29;"I want the fries to come with a barbecue dipping sauce."
28:29;28:29;"Great."
28:29;28:31;"We got that."
28:31;28:32;"Great."
28:32;28:34;"And the tomato."
28:34;28:35;"That's what I grew up with."
28:35;28:37;"I love a tomato on my burger."
28:37;28:39;"And they all--"
28:39;28:46;"No, but the genius of the Travis Scott meal was, it was his version of the McDonald's meal."
28:46;28:47;"Of course."
28:47;28:48;"It's his version."
28:48;28:49;"Yeah."
28:49;28:53;"No, well, actually, he's not bringing any outdoor ingredients."
28:53;28:57;"I was going to make a similar joke that before McDonald's went to Travis Scott,"
28:57;29:00;"they went to me and I had a very similar meal."
29:00;29:01;"And they said, what is it?"
29:01;29:03;"And I said, OK, Sprite instead of Coke."
29:03;29:05;"All good."
29:05;29:07;"Barbecue sauce instead of ketchup."
29:07;29:08;"Easy."
29:08;29:11;"And then I said, and bacon on the quarter pounder."
29:11;29:12;"No problem."
29:12;29:14;"And I said, well, hold on a second, though."
29:14;29:20;"I need a big piece of circular peppered bacon, like the one from the Arch Deluxe."
29:20;29:24;"And they said, well, you know, we can't do that."
29:24;29:27;"Obviously, the Arch Deluxe almost bankrupted us."
29:27;29:29;"We don't have that circular peppered bacon anymore."
29:29;29:31;"We could use regular bacon."
29:31;29:34;"And I said, it's got to be circular and it's got to be peppered."
29:34;29:37;"And they said, we're going with our runner up, Travis Scott."
29:37;29:40;"And that's how I lost $75 million."
29:40;29:42;"But when I think about the Arch Deluxe,"
29:42;29:46;"you think about how much money went in for the circular."
29:46;29:50;"You got to get the machine that cuts the bacon in the circle and the pepper."
29:50;29:51;"It's so expensive."
29:51;29:54;"And that's like some old school where somebody was like,"
29:54;29:56;"we need to save this company by adding a new thing."
29:56;29:58;"It's going to get new people in the door."
29:58;30:03;"What's brilliant about this and back to this, like the society of the spectacle,"
30:03;30:05;"everything is just like a vague gesture at something."
30:05;30:06;"Nothing's real."
30:06;30:09;"What's amazing about this is Travis Scott comes in"
30:09;30:15;"with a similarly exciting idea, except his, it's nothing."
30:15;30:17;"It's like doesn't exist."
30:17;30:19;"It's literally just the celebrity saying,"
30:19;30:22;"go to McDonald's and order something that you could have been ordering"
30:22;30:24;"for your entire life, but you never thought of it"
30:24;30:26;"because you don't actually like Sprite."
30:26;30:28;"And you actually like to have your fries with ketchup."
30:28;30:32;"But now I'm telling you to go just ask for this random sh*t."
30:32;30:35;"And on top of that, here's a website full of clothes that you can order,"
30:35;30:36;"but they don't even exist yet."
30:36;30:38;"And they may or may not get to you in three months."
30:38;30:40;"I just love that none of it exists."
30:40;30:44;"How many people went into and ordered the Travis Scott meal"
30:44;30:45;"and then asked if they could have ketchup?"
30:45;30:48;"Right."
30:48;30:51;"And also, and also some step it out for a Coke."
30:51;30:55;"I watched a video or somebody posted on Instagram."
30:55;30:58;"I think this must've been Bill Simmons is the ringer guy."
30:58;30:59;"Yeah."
30:59;31:02;"I always want to call him Bill Walton because it's sports."
31:02;31:04;"It's funnier to imagine Bill Walton,"
31:04;31:08;"but he kind of like filmed his son as they pulled into McDonald's."
31:08;31:10;"He's like, I'm going to McDonald's for the first time in years"
31:10;31:12;"because my son wants this Travis Scott burger."
31:12;31:14;"He's kind of making fun of his son for like taking this."
31:14;31:15;"Yeah."
31:15;31:18;"And one thing I clocked in the video is that they pull up to the drive-thru"
31:18;31:20;"and he's like, can I get the Travis Scott meal?"
31:20;31:22;"And they say like, what do you want to drink?"
31:22;31:23;"And the kid's like a Coke."
31:23;31:25;"And he's like, are they asking like, do you want a Coke or Sprite?"
31:25;31:26;"And he's like Coke."
31:26;31:30;"So it's like already the sacred meal has crumbled."
31:30;31:30;"It's like religion."
31:30;31:34;"It's just like an esoteric idea that by going to McDonald's"
31:34;31:36;"and ordering something that's already exists,"
31:37;31:42;"you are somehow participating in the cult of Travis Scott."
31:42;31:45;"And then you look at the clothes and it also wouldn't shock me."
31:45;31:48;"Like the McRib shorts, we've talked about this before."
31:48;31:49;"Travis Scott sells a load of merch."
31:49;31:51;"Maybe a lot of people are trying to buy it,"
31:51;31:55;"but also it wouldn't shock me if they didn't even actually make the McRib shorts."
31:55;31:57;"They just created it so that people like us are like,"
31:57;31:59;"holy they made McRib shorts."
31:59;32:04;"I just love the idea that like maybe Travis Scott, he's very savvy, smart guy."
32:04;32:07;"Maybe he studied the history of McDonald's and he went into them and said,"
32:07;32:09;"hey guys, just slip in a little bit."
32:09;32:13;"I've actually done a lot of research on the whole Arch Deluxe debacle."
32:13;32:19;"By my estimate, you lost hundreds of millions of dollars on that, all that bulls**t."
32:19;32:24;"I can get you a very similar amount of hype and clout."
32:24;32:26;"I only need a tenth of the money."
32:26;32:29;"And they might've been like, hell yeah, like let's do it."
32:29;32:34;"You know, like, he's like, none of this s**t even has to exist."
32:34;32:36;"It's amazing. It's like nothingness."
32:36;32:41;"I guess this show should do its due diligence and follow up and try to order the McRib shorts."
32:41;32:43;"Do we have the budget for that?"
32:43;32:46;"I think the drop is over. I think you'd have to go on StockX."
32:46;32:52;"Where, by the way, I've seen these items for resale at like two and three times the value"
32:52;32:52;"that they were being sold."
32:52;32:57;"But I saw people don't even, they don't even have it yet. This is like, um, wait, uh oh."
32:57;32:58;"Futures."
32:58;33:02;"And this sounds a lot like the 2008 financial crash for people were, what's this?"
33:02;33:06;"What are all these funny big short words?"
33:06;33:11;"People are purchasing tranches of Travis Scott McDonald's speculative merch"
33:11;33:14;"and reselling it and they don't have it."
33:14;33:16;"And then if there's like a StockX margin call."
33:16;33:22;"I feel like I'm vaguely using these words."
33:22;33:24;"Who's our finance guy on the team?"
33:24;33:26;"Who knows the most about finance here?"
33:26;33:27;"Not me."
33:27;33:27;"No."
33:27;33:28;"Maybe Nick?"
33:28;33:32;"No, I'm absolutely not a finance guy."
33:32;33:36;"But the best part would be them breaking up the shorts into millions of pieces."
33:36;33:38;"What is that?"
33:38;33:43;"When they like, rebundle."
33:43;33:44;"Right."
33:44;33:49;"It's like the New York Firefighters Retirement Fund."
33:49;33:50;"Has invested."
33:50;33:57;"Invested tens of millions of dollars in this Travis Scott thing."
33:57;33:59;"And it's, it went up in smoke."
33:59;34:00;"It was a full made off."
34:00;34:00;"Yeah."
34:00;34:02;"It's just, it's so made up."
34:02;34:04;"The shorts didn't even exist."
34:04;34:06;"It didn't even exist."
34:06;34:09;"You're trading tiny pieces of merch tranches."
34:09;34:10;"So small and esoteric."
34:10;34:12;"You didn't even know what it was."
34:12;34:16;"And meanwhile, there's some poor schmuck, some poor kid in Florida."
34:16;34:18;"Sitting in his house, waiting for these shorts."
34:18;34:19;"And you know what?"
34:19;34:19;"That kid's."
34:19;34:21;"These are real people's lives."
34:21;34:25;"Do you understand what we're talking about?"
34:25;34:26;"It's real clout."
34:26;34:28;"It's real clout we're talking about."
34:28;34:31;"Just as a footnote, McDonald's spent over $300 million"
34:31;34:34;"on research, production and marketing for the Arch Deluxe."
34:34;34:35;"It was 300 million?"
34:35;34:37;"According to Wikipedia."
34:37;34:37;"Holy sh*t."
34:37;34:41;"So even if they paid Travis Scott 75 million,"
34:41;34:43;"again, this is 20 plus years ago."
34:43;34:44;"I love it."
34:44;34:45;"Just nothing exists."
34:45;34:49;"I just want to say for Jake, not knowing really much about Travis Scott."
34:49;34:51;"I have had this thought for real in the past."
34:51;34:54;"That like Travis Scott didn't really exist."
34:54;34:57;"And you can't say that about a lot of artists."
34:57;35:01;"But because of the Cactus Jack and because he's all the face covering."
35:01;35:06;"And then he's now doing these shows in a Fortnite in a video game."
35:06;35:09;"There has been this kind of ambiguity around him,"
35:09;35:13;"almost like a little Michaela or something that I have had a thought."
35:13;35:18;"Then when you start saying, oh, now he's done this project with McDonald's,"
35:18;35:21;"where he's introduced nothing new, just a name."
35:21;35:24;"And now the shorts don't exist that he's merchandising."
35:24;35:25;"It does fit into this whole."
35:26;35:27;"Wow."
35:27;35:27;"Yeah."
35:27;35:32;"You know, of a created celebrity that honestly, before this,"
35:32;35:34;"you know, I looked him up and I said, you know,"
35:34;35:36;"I don't even really know if I know what he looks like."
35:36;35:38;"Like I know if I have an idea of is what his hair."
35:38;35:38;"Wow."
35:38;35:42;"This is I was saying this to Jake the other day that it's like,"
35:42;35:44;"I've been listening to him for a little while."
35:44;35:48;"I couldn't really describe what he sounds like or like what his voice like."
35:48;35:51;"He's very it is very ethereal."
35:51;35:52;"Like Travis Scott is a concept."
35:53;35:57;"It's very like Travis Scott is the CIA plant."
35:57;35:59;"It's a sign up."
35:59;36:01;"I think he's also just savvy because and again,"
36:01;36:04;"there might be some 14 year old listening who's just like, you guys are morons."
36:04;36:08;"Like, oh, I'm actually like deeply connected to his fans."
36:08;36:12;"He might also just understand some of the nuances of modern marketing."
36:12;36:16;"One thing that I can say as somebody who's kind of one foot in one foot out"
36:16;36:20;"by always using the action figure avatar of himself,"
36:20;36:22;"which was the cover of one of his albums and not just the album,"
36:22;36:26;"like that version of him, the action figure Travis Scott pops up a lot."
36:26;36:28;"It's in the McDonald's campaign."
36:28;36:29;"Oh, it is the McDonald's campaign."
36:29;36:30;"It was it's all merch."
36:30;36:35;"When I picture him, when I do a Google image search of my mind's eye,"
36:35;36:41;"one of the top two pictures is the action figure, the eternal avatar."
36:41;36:45;"You can imagine that when Travis Scott, the third assumes control of the empire,"
36:45;36:50;"he might actually still be performing in Fortnite and whatever the modern"
36:50;36:52;"Neuralink version of it is."
36:52;36:58;"There's like a way that Travis Scott can transcend the brick and blood physicality world."
36:58;37:02;"I think it's interesting, though, that you guys said that you're not even sure what he looks like."
37:02;37:03;"We do know what he looks like."
37:03;37:07;"It's honestly, it's an it's an idea of what he looks like."
37:07;37:07;"I know."
37:07;37:10;"And the thing is, I see him all the time."
37:10;37:13;"I mean, that's but it's something he's always eschewing."
37:13;37:15;"It's like he's covering his face."
37:15;37:15;"That's right."
37:15;37:18;"He's he is his avatar."
37:18;37:23;"And it's, you know, obviously, like his music, it's like heavily auto tuned in a in a brilliant way."
37:23;37:24;"I'm a fan."
37:24;37:30;"I'm just saying that it has occurred to me before with someone who has so many singles and is so"
37:30;37:37;"ubiquitous to not really understand and like to not have a clear picture of what he looks like or"
37:37;37:40;"be able to describe what he sounds like."
37:40;37:40;"How about this?"
37:40;37:41;"It's wild."
37:41;37:43;"Is he the contemporary Steve Miller?"
37:44;37:46;"Oh, I don't know."
37:46;37:48;"Wow."
37:48;37:52;"Steve Miller looks like and Steve Miller is completely ubiquitous."
37:52;37:54;"It's very middle of the road."
37:54;37:56;"Travis Scott is more hits than Steve Miller."
37:56;38:00;"I'm not bringing this up in a qualitatively negative sense."
38:00;38:01;"I'm not trying to bag on Travis Scott."
38:01;38:07;"I'm just saying Travis Scott, Steve Miller and future is Jerry Garcia, a little wilder,"
38:07;38:08;"a little weirder."
38:08;38:11;"If I'm interpreting what you guys are saying correctly, because like,"
38:12;38:15;"I do feel like I know what Travis looks Travis Scott looks like it sounds like."
38:15;38:22;"But I see your point a little more when I compare him to comparably big hip hop artists."
38:22;38:27;"When I compare Travis Scott to Kanye, Drake, even Tekashi 69."
38:27;38:32;"These are people who are all of those guys and Tekashi 69."
38:32;38:35;"He's a little too spicy, probably to get big endorsements."
38:35;38:39;"But Drake, for instance, Drake is big enough and well known enough that he could get"
38:40;38:42;"a McDonald's campaign theoretically."
38:42;38:49;"But Drake, to get to where Drake is, he had to like become America's sweetheart more."
38:49;38:54;"He had to give more of his personality had to be more open and be more like a regular celebrity."
38:54;39:01;"I think Travis Scott has somehow become as ubiquitous as a Drake or a Kanye or a Tekashi 69"
39:01;39:02;"without doing all that."
39:02;39:04;"And that that is interesting."
39:04;39:09;"Ezra, would you say that Travis Scott is almost like a Borgesian figure?"
39:09;39:12;"I didn't want to say but it crossed my mind."
39:12;39:18;"I mean, as much as I like to give Greta Van Fleet for understanding the nuances of the"
39:18;39:21;"Borgesian literature and existence."
39:21;39:25;"I do think Travis Scott is the celebrity of our times."
39:25;39:27;"He understands things better."
39:27;39:30;"Yeah, it's like Kanye is so much more."
39:30;39:32;"Okay, here's one thing I can say."
39:32;39:39;"So and I'm sure again, this has become a little bit of like, aging dudes hip hop hour, but"
39:39;39:39;"that's okay."
39:39;39:41;"That's partially what time crisis is."
39:41;39:47;"If we were 10 years older, and we were talking about Kanye at peak Kanye, like 10 years ago,"
39:47;39:51;"even though we would still be like, older and a little more out of the loop."
39:51;39:55;"Kanye just use traditional media in such a familiar way."
39:55;39:59;"Like everybody knows who Kanye is their grandparents talking about."
40:00;40:03;"Oh, Kanye, he's the man who grabbed the mic from Taylor Swift."
40:03;40:06;"Again, it's like familiar using the typical tools of mass media, you know what he looks"
40:06;40:09;"like, you know, his big iconic media moments."
40:09;40:11;"Travis Scott is more elusive."
40:11;40:17;"And in that sense, like he's almost more present than again, to compare him to Takashi 6ix9ine."
40:17;40:20;"And again, this is like has nothing to do with my understanding of music, just my deep"
40:20;40:22;"love of the Arch Deluxe."
40:22;40:25;"But Takashi 6ix9ine, he's a familiar guy."
40:25;40:26;"He's in the middle."
40:26;40:30;"Travis Scott is both more than him and less than him."
40:30;40:31;"You know what I mean?"
40:31;40:34;"Takashi 6ix9ine is brick and mortar, flesh and blood."
40:34;40:41;"Travis Scott is like the eternal digital soul and the mysterious nothingness at the heart"
40:41;40:42;"of existence."
40:42;40:43;"You know what I mean?"
40:43;40:45;"He's like the ghost in the machine, almost."
40:45;40:47;"He's the ghost in the machine."
40:47;40:51;"Incidentally, I don't know if we'd mentioned this, but Travis Scott is something of a"
40:51;40:52;"protege of Kanye West's."
40:52;40:53;"Right."
40:54;40:56;"It's always been unclear to me what their relationship is."
40:56;41:02;"It seems like Travis was briefly signed to Kanye West's Good Music as a producer."
41:02;41:03;"And then I think he struck out on his own."
41:03;41:06;"But they still there's no love lost between them."
41:06;41:09;"Wait, that means they were related basically."
41:09;41:10;"For that's true."
41:10;41:10;"That's true, too."
41:10;41:12;"I've always been slightly confused by this phrase."
41:12;41:13;"No love lost."
41:13;41:15;"That means that people don't love."
41:15;41:17;"They don't love each other."
41:17;41:18;"Yeah, I thought that was a negative."
41:18;41:20;"Did I use it the opposite way?"
41:20;41:21;"Yeah, you did."
41:21;41:22;"Well, you know what I mean?"
41:22;41:23;"You're saying they're cool."
41:23;41:24;"They're cool with each other."
41:24;41:26;"I think they're cool with each other."
41:26;41:27;"But wait, no love lost."
41:27;41:29;"It means they never loved each other."
41:29;41:30;"So there's nothing lost."
41:30;41:32;"Oh, but OK, I get that."
41:32;41:35;"But it could also literally mean the opposite, right?"
41:35;41:39;"Like if they love each other and they still love each other, there is no love lost."
41:39;41:40;"It's an odd phrase."
41:40;41:42;"They love each other."
41:42;41:43;"No, I get it."
41:43;41:46;"I mean, I understand."
41:46;41:48;"I've never been 100% clear in that phrase."
41:48;41:52;"So, Jake, I hope that all answers your question about who Travis Scott is."
41:52;41:55;"I think if you look at his Wikipedia, say Travis Scott is an American rapper,"
41:55;42:04;"Borghese and figure ghost in the machine and inverted negative space arch deluxe of American"
42:04;42:07;"culture, restaurant, consultant."
42:07;42:08;"Wait, Jake, one thing."
42:08;42:10;"Can you guess what Travis Scott's real name is?"
42:10;42:12;"I can't."
42:12;42:16;"He is Jacques Webster II."
42:16;42:17;"It's really not a bad name."
42:17;42:20;"Jacques Webster teaming up with McDonald's."
42:20;42:24;"I mean, I think that's sort of part of his mystique that he has chosen to use another"
42:24;42:25;"real name."
42:25;42:26;"Right."
42:26;42:27;"As a moniker for."
42:27;42:31;"Well, I was thinking that maybe that was part of the appeal of McDonald's, too, because"
42:31;42:32;"it's like it could be an athlete."
42:32;42:35;"It could like, as I said, it could be a country star."
42:35;42:39;"I'm picturing some grandma taking her grandkids to McDonald's and the kids being like, let"
42:39;42:40;"me get the Travis Scott meal."
42:40;42:41;"And the grandma's like, who's that?"
42:41;42:43;"Seeing as he a football player?"
42:43;42:45;"No, he's a rapper."
42:45;42:45;"Oh, OK."
42:45;42:47;"Look, it's too first."
42:47;42:52;"But if it was like the Post Malone meal at McDonald's, it wouldn't be as appealing to"
42:52;42:54;"sort of like Main Street."
42:54;42:56;"Like what's Post Malone?"
42:56;42:57;"What's that?"
42:57;42:57;"Who's that?"
42:57;42:59;"Like it would just be confusing to people."
42:59;43:00;"Travis Scott."
43:00;43:03;"It's like a very like innocuous name."
43:03;43:04;"It rolls off the tongue."
43:04;43:06;"Easy."
43:06;43:07;"The Travis Scott meal."
43:07;43:08;"Right."
43:08;43:09;"It's simple."
43:09;43:10;"It's it's kind of a nothing name."
43:10;43:11;"See, that's what's funny."
43:11;43:12;"This is a guy loaded."
43:12;43:16;"He actually had a more interesting name and he became Travis Scott."
43:17;43:22;"It's not like he became like old dirty bastard or nothing man or you're just like give himself"
43:22;43:25;"like kind of like a cool, weird, provocative superhero name."
43:25;43:30;"He took like a kind of cool name like Jacques Webster, the second and became just Travis"
43:30;43:31;"Scott."
43:31;43:33;"His original name is almost like a Bond villain."
43:33;43:36;"Jacques Webster, the second."
43:36;43:42;"Anyway, so I guess, you know, bottom line, like I've learned some things."
43:42;43:43;"McDonald's and Travis Scott."
43:43;43:45;"I think we barely scratched the surface here."
43:46;43:51;"I think we need to go read up on some French philosophy to fully, truly understand this"
43:51;43:52;"cultural moment."
43:52;43:55;"It's down freezing cold."
43:55;43:58;"That's how we already know when it's here."
43:58;44:01;"My dog will probably do it for Louis Bell."
44:01;44:03;"That's just all he know."
44:03;44:04;"He don't know nothing else."
44:04;44:06;"I tried to show."
44:06;44:09;"Yeah."
44:09;44:13;"I tried to show."
44:13;44:16;"Yeah."
44:16;44:18;"Yeah."
44:18;44:19;"Yeah."
44:19;44:19;"Yeah."
44:19;44:20;"Yeah."
44:20;44:22;"Gone on you with the pick and roll."
44:22;44:24;"Young flame here in sicko mode."
44:24;44:34;"Made this here with all the ice on in the booth at the gate outside when they pull up,"
44:34;44:35;"they give me loose."
44:35;44:35;"Yeah."
44:35;44:40;"Jump off boys as Nike boys hopping our coats way to be when we pull up."
44:40;44:41;"Give me the Lou."
44:41;44:44;"Was off the Remy had a bad post."
44:44;44:49;"Had to in my old town to duck the news to pull out a lockdown."
44:49;44:50;"We made no moves."
44:50;44:53;"Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up popping with the cool."
44:53;44:55;"I just landed in chase."
44:55;44:58;"We mix this pop like Jamba Joe's different color change."
44:58;45:01;"See my jewelry selling fruits and a joking man."
45:01;45:02;"No, the crackers with you."
45:02;45:08;"You're listening to time crisis."
45:08;45:10;"That's enough about new music."
45:10;45:14;"Jake, I heard you have some things to say about the new Rolling Stone top 500 greatest"
45:14;45:15;"albums of all time."
45:15;45:15;"That's right."
45:15;45:19;"Which dropped this past week, which by the way, I didn't realize it was dropping."
45:20;45:25;"And I heard about it because I was in the studio with Arielle and somebody hit him up about it"
45:25;45:26;"because he voted."
45:26;45:30;"And then I vaguely remembered, oh, yeah, I kind of remember getting an email that said,"
45:30;45:34;"do you want to vote in this and like kind of clocking it?"
45:34;45:36;"And then like I was like realizing I never did."
45:36;45:39;"So once again, I failed culture."
45:39;45:42;"Just like the times where I didn't get to vote in the Grammys."
45:42;45:44;"I didn't vote in the Rolling Stone 500."
45:44;45:46;"And apparently people like Beyonce did."
45:46;45:49;"So I would have been in good company, but I didn't."
45:49;45:50;"I f***ed up."
45:50;45:54;"And there is I found out there's one Vampire Weekend album in there."
45:54;45:54;"Yeah."
45:54;45:56;"Modern Vampires of the City."
45:56;45:58;"But one funny thing is nobody hit me up about it."
45:58;46:04;"Maybe nobody cares to tell me that a seven year old album is in the top 500."
46:04;46:07;"But then I was trying to think, when's the last time they did one?"
46:07;46:11;"I have some vague memory that maybe our first album used to be in there."
46:11;46:14;"Well, anyway, it made me kind of wonder a lot."
46:14;46:16;"I would love to know what fell out."
46:16;46:18;"And somehow Arielle knew."
46:18;46:21;"I don't know if it has to do with the person who told him, but Arielle was like,"
46:21;46:25;"did you hear that ZZ Top fully fell out of the top 500 this time?"
46:25;46:31;"I guess in years past, they had both Trace Ombres and Eliminator in the top 500."
46:31;46:32;"But no more."
46:32;46:35;"Anyway, that's my experience with the top 500."
46:35;46:37;"Jake, how did it come across your desk?"
46:37;46:40;"There was a lot of activity around it in my Twitter feed."
46:40;46:43;"Initially, I was sort of like, who cares?"
46:43;46:48;"But then I looked at it today and just made a few notes of what kind of stuck out to me."
46:48;46:54;"But I do want to say, Modern Vampires of the City was number 328."
46:54;46:55;"Solid."
46:55;46:58;"You were edged out by the Who live at Leeds."
46:58;47:02;"I'm surprised that that actually is still in there."
47:02;47:05;"OK, here's a question."
47:05;47:09;"What do you think is the highest ranking indie record?"
47:10;47:13;"Something that would be unambiguously categorized as indie."
47:13;47:14;"Unambiguously?"
47:14;47:15;"That's a great question."
47:15;47:16;"I was surprised."
47:16;47:19;"Velvet Underground, we couldn't call unambiguously indie."
47:19;47:21;"That was a phrase that didn't exist then."
47:21;47:24;"Indie is like post-punk, you know?"
47:24;47:26;"We're saying like 82, 83 at the earliest."
47:26;47:28;"An REM album, maybe?"
47:28;47:29;"No."
47:29;47:32;"OK, because like huge artists like Nevermind was number six."
47:32;47:33;"And Nirvana is not indie."
47:33;47:34;"Right."
47:34;47:37;"No, yeah, I know what you mean."
47:37;47:37;"True indie."
47:37;47:39;"Like something that didn't sell millions of copies."
47:39;47:40;"Yeah."
47:40;47:43;"I don't know, like Slanted and Enchanted."
47:43;47:45;"Like that's like a classic critics pick."
47:45;47:46;"I mean, that's what I would have guessed too."
47:46;47:50;"That was coming in at $199."
47:50;47:54;"There was a record at number 56, also released on Matador."
47:54;47:54;"Oh, Matador."
47:54;47:57;"Is it from the 90s?"
47:57;47:57;"It is."
47:57;48:00;"I mean, is it Guided by Voices?"
48:00;48:03;"No, GBV was denied."
48:03;48:03;"Shut out."
48:03;48:05;"Into the 500."
48:05;48:08;"I love Bill and Sebastian, but I doubt they're coming at 56."
48:08;48:09;"No."
48:09;48:10;"Cat Power?"
48:10;48:12;"No, there was no Cat Power on the list."
48:12;48:16;"There was a Bill and Sebastian like in the 400s, if I remember."
48:16;48:18;"But you're getting warmer with Cat Power."
48:18;48:21;"Solo female artist on Matador."
48:21;48:23;"Was Liz Phair on Matador?"
48:23;48:24;"Oh, right."
48:24;48:25;"I noticed that."
48:25;48:27;"Exile and Guy Vaughn."
48:27;48:28;"Is a great record."
48:28;48:29;"I love that record."
48:29;48:32;"And that is also a classic critics' fave."
48:32;48:34;"That's something about when I look through this stuff."
48:34;48:38;"And to Rolling Stone's credit, first of all, thank you for inviting me to vote."
48:38;48:40;"I'm setting a terrible example for every--"
48:40;48:44;"obviously, please vote in the upcoming elections."
48:44;48:47;"I am proud that we got an album in there without me voting."
48:47;48:51;"Because then I would have had to deal with the moral quandary of whether or not to vote for us."
48:51;48:54;"Which I don't think I could have brought myself to do."
48:54;48:57;"But I know for a fact that Arielle voted."
48:57;49:01;"And I know that Beyonce voted because they said she voted."
49:01;49:02;"So then I'm wondering how many--"
49:02;49:05;"I assume it's a mix of critics and artists."
49:05;49:07;"I know that Stephen Hyden voted."
49:07;49:10;"I saw that on his Twitter."
49:10;49:11;"Let me just read this to you."
49:11;49:16;"""To do so, we received and tabulated the top 50 albums lists from more than 300 artists,"
49:16;49:19;"producers, critics, and music industry figures."
49:19;49:27;"The electorate included Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, rising stars or artists like"
49:27;49:32;"Her, Tierra Whack, Lindsey Jordan of Snail Mail, and veterans such as Adam Clayton and"
49:32;49:40;"The Edge from U2, Raekwon from Wu-Tang, Gene Simmons, and Stevie Nicks."""
49:40;49:43;"I mean, all right, to their credit, they really were trying to get a mix of old and young."
49:43;49:49;"And the newest album I saw on there was Frank Ocean Blonde, which came out like four years ago."
49:49;49:51;"And there was-- oh, Kendrick Damm."
49:51;49:53;"Kendrick Damm was probably the newest album that I saw."
49:53;49:56;"And the Harry Styles record from last year was on there somewhere."
49:56;49:58;"OK, so maybe that was the newest."
49:58;50:01;"It was the Harry Styles from last year was up in there."
50:01;50:05;"But the truth is, even if they make a big push to get a bunch of young people to vote,"
50:05;50:10;"I'm sure Taylor Swift and Beyonce are going to throw down a lot of classic albums."
50:10;50:18;"It might take 100 years for you to start to see a totally changing of the guard."
50:18;50:23;"Because if I did it, which is the title of OJ Simpson's book,"
50:23;50:28;"if I did it, I'm sure I would have picked a few albums from the past decade."
50:28;50:33;"But I hate to say it, if I was honest with myself, I'd be picking a lot of basic, tasteful--"
50:34;50:38;"[MUSIC - ""I NEVER SAID NOTHING""]"
50:38;51:05;"[MUSIC - ""I NEVER SAID NOTHING""]"
51:05;51:10;"Speaking of, where do you think the highest ranking Grateful Dead record was?"
51:10;51:12;"I remember Clocking American Beauty."
51:12;51:15;"Definitely not top 100."
51:15;51:18;"That sounds like in the two or three hundreds to me."
51:18;51:19;"Yeah, it was 215."
51:19;51:21;"That's a top 100 record."
51:21;51:24;"Get Jacob Ballett next time."
51:24;51:30;"I wonder if it was weighted voting, because I was surprised to see the Kiss"
51:30;51:32;"live album on there, number 305."
51:32;51:33;"Interesting."
51:33;51:38;"I was just picturing Gene Simmons just listing that album 50 times."
51:38;51:38;"Right."
51:38;51:46;"500 is such a big number that it's like, by the time you get down to the last Tyree Stiles record,"
51:46;51:50;"is that four votes is enough to get you in the top five?"
51:50;51:54;"Because there must be thousands and thousands of records that got one vote."
51:54;51:54;"Yeah."
51:54;51:56;"And there's just not enough consent."
51:56;52:00;"Also, one thing I'll say is that probably some artists like the Grateful Dead"
52:00;52:03;"are at least partially the victims of like..."
52:03;52:09;"I bet Grateful Dead would be top 100 if you were asking people to vote on the 50 most iconic"
52:09;52:14;"artists of the post-war era, because it'd be very easy for a lot of people to say,"
52:14;52:15;"""Well, Grateful Dead, look what they accomplished."""
52:15;52:23;"Not every artist has a Sgt. Peppers where it becomes this article of faith that that's their"
52:23;52:24;"opus."
52:24;52:24;"Right."
52:24;52:28;"I can even picture some people being like, ""Well, my favorite Beatles album is like,"
52:28;52:34;"I don't know, like Magical Mystery Tour, but I got to put Sgt. Pepper because that's more of"
52:34;52:37;"an iconic, important album."" It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy."
52:37;52:41;"So in the case of the Grateful Dead, nobody's going to put like,"
52:41;52:46;"Blues for Allah. It's part of their story and they're as iconic as the Beatles to me in many"
52:46;52:52;"ways, but they don't have that album that every... I guess American Beauty is their closest."
52:52;52:57;"Well, yeah, I would say that the deadheads that would actually be voting for the dead"
52:57;53:01;"are so deep in it that American Beauty is too basic."
53:01;53:01;"Right."
53:01;53:05;"True deadheads are not down with talking about American Beauty."
53:05;53:06;"What were some of your other observations?"
53:06;53:11;"I thought there was a huge omission because there was a ton of compilation albums,"
53:11;53:16;"which I understand for some of the artists that were making music before the album became the"
53:16;53:22;"sort of de facto form. So you're Muddy Waters, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry."
53:22;53:24;"I understand that there's a couple of..."
53:24;53:29;"But then there was like Bob Marley Legend and Madonna Immaculate Collection, which is a little"
53:29;53:35;"bit like... And those are artists that had actual real albums elsewhere in the top 500. So it made"
53:35;53:38;"me think the most glaring omission is the greatest selling album of all time."
53:38;53:41;"Oh, it's the Eagles, right? So Eagles greatest hits."
53:41;53:42;"The Eagles greatest hits."
53:42;53:44;"Was Hotel California in there?"
53:44;53:48;"Yes, it came in at number 118, which is respectable."
53:48;53:50;"Was that the only Eagles album?"
53:50;53:53;"I think the first Eagles record was in there somewhere."
53:53;53:54;"Yeah."
53:54;53:56;"It's a ridiculous thing to go to bat for, but..."
53:56;54:00;"It's a self-fulfilling privacy thing where it's like, even though it's such a huge selling album,"
54:00;54:06;"it doesn't have the... Even an Eagles fan critic person would still pick Hotel California over it."
54:06;54:10;"I don't know exactly why. Hotel California just has more of this aura."
54:10;54:12;"Yeah, I mean, I just..."
54:12;54:14;"Legend is also like..."
54:14;54:21;"Legend is the most basic greatest hits CD you'd ever have next to the Eagles greatest hits."
54:21;54:27;"Legend famously, similar to Dark Side of the Moon, I think was in the... There used to be a thing,"
54:27;54:32;"Billboard charts, they created an alternate chart for stuff that had been out forever."
54:32;54:35;"And Legend was up there with Pink Floyd as just this perennial seller."
54:35;54:45;"So it's a real thing that Legend, I'm sure, dwarfs any other Bob Marley album in terms of sales."
54:45;54:46;"Oh, I'm sure."
54:46;54:49;"I guess, obviously, you're saying that's the same thing with the Eagles."
54:49;54:56;"But there's something about Legend that became the de facto entry point for all subsequent"
54:56;55:00;"generations of people interested in Bob Marley. So it's like, even though you're right,"
55:00;55:04;"it is just kind of like a random greatest hits. There's something about Bob Marley Legend that"
55:04;55:09;"does have... Maybe just because it sold so many copies, it has this aura. And I think"
55:09;55:16;"Bob Marley, for the average American fan, doesn't have a Hotel California."
55:16;55:21;"Yeah. There was a few other things that I thought were interesting. The highest ranked U2 album."
55:21;55:25;"I clocked this too. It's Octoon, baby, right? It's above Joshua Tree."
55:25;55:32;"Yeah. And they were really close together. Octoon was 124, Joshua was 135. And then similarly,"
55:32;55:38;"much to the consternation of... Or it would be much to the consternation of James Gandolfini"
55:38;55:45;"if he was still with us. Green Day Juki coming in at number 375. American Idiot, 248."
55:45;55:46;"Oh, man, come on."
55:46;55:47;"Blowing Juki out of the water."
55:47;55:54;"That's the classic bias towards capital I important works. American Idiot was seen as"
55:54;55:59;"Green Day speaking truth to power, tackling big ideas, talking about the state of the world,"
55:59;56:02;"the state of America, all this. Whereas Juki..."
56:02;56:04;"It's called Juki."
56:04;56:13;"Whereas Juki is called Juki. I mean, Juki is a more important record than American Idiot by any"
56:13;56:18;"metric. I'm not dissing American Idiot, but come on, we're talking about Juki here."
56:18;56:19;"It's a beautiful record."
56:19;56:20;"Yeah, it's a beautiful record."
56:20;56:24;"Rumors came in at number 7, Fleetwood Mac Rumors, 7."
56:24;56:29;"Solid. I wonder if Rumors is going up in the charts. I could imagine 10, 20 years ago,"
56:29;56:32;"people not wanting to give it up for Rumors in the same way."
56:32;56:37;"For sure. Because the first one was an 03, and then they did a revised one in 2012."
56:37;56:40;"I was shocked to see Rumors so high up at number 7."
56:40;56:40;"That's great."
56:40;56:44;"But I was equally shocked to see no Tusk."
56:44;56:46;"Tusk is too funky for a lot of people."
56:46;56:50;"Shut out. But I feel like music nerds, who it seems like the most people,"
56:50;56:55;"like people submitting their ballots for probably professional musicians or music nerds,"
56:55;56:59;"are like up on Tusk, right?"
56:59;57:03;"If you told me that Tusk was in there at like 297, I'd be like, ""Yeah, oh, cool."""
57:03;57:04;"Sure, of course."
57:04;57:06;"It took a Trace Ombre slot."

57:37;57:43;"And then there were definitely like, yeah, like 10 Bob Dylan records, every Kanye record."
57:43;57:46;"As we've discussed many times, Kanye and Bob Dylan, a lot in common."
57:46;57:53;"Exactly. I did notice that Dark Twisted Fantasy edged out Highway 61."
57:53;57:54;"Oh, they were like next to each other?"
57:54;57:57;"They were next to each other. It was like, you know, whatever it was,"
57:57;57:59;"like 19 and 20 or whatever it was."
57:59;58:00;"Wow."
58:00;58:04;"Then I was thinking, if I had to choose like the greatest all-time album,"
58:05;58:09;"I would probably just choose like Alien Lanes, but I acknowledge that that doesn't have"
58:09;58:14;"the cultural footprint that is required for an album to be the greatest."
58:14;58:19;"And then I was looking through it and then I saw that Kanye and I love Twisted Fantasy,"
58:19;58:23;"but then I was like, maybe Highway 61 would be my number one. I don't know."
58:23;58:26;"I'm not gonna like rack my brain over it, but like..."
58:26;58:27;"It's a great album."
58:27;58:30;"At a certain point, you kind of throw up your hands, right? I mean, it's sort of like..."
58:30;58:33;"I always get confused between that and bringing it all back home,"
58:33;58:35;"because the covers are similar with the white borders."
58:35;58:38;"Also, I got into them at the same time, so it's like..."
58:38;58:39;"Interesting."
58:39;58:42;"But yeah, Highway 61 is..."
58:42;58:42;"I think you're saying..."
58:42;58:43;"It opens with like a Rolling Stone."
58:43;58:48;"It's like a Rolling Stone from a Buick. Is that what it was?"
58:48;58:54;"Tom Thumbs, blues, it closes with Desolation Row, like Queen Jane approximately. I don't know."
58:54;58:56;"The Ballad of a Thin Man?"
58:56;58:57;"That's on there, yeah."
58:57;58:59;"Well, it's also... I think there's something funny too."
59:00;59:04;"We really got to do like a philosophy episode, because I got some things I want to..."
59:04;59:06;"Some questions I want to ask. Get some real philosophers on."
59:06;59:10;"There's something also that's inherent in the proposition"
59:10;59:13;"of asking people to list the greatest 500 albums."
59:13;59:18;"I can picture a lot of people bending their own preference to the spectacle."
59:18;59:23;"Like I was talking about the example of somebody whose personal favorite Beatles record or..."
59:23;59:24;"You know, is something."
59:24;59:27;"And yet, they'd know that to represent the Beatles,"
59:27;59:34;"they have to bend to Sgt. Pepper because that's like the one that is been said to be so important"
59:34;59:39;"over and over again that its importance is like the orders of magnitude greater than,"
59:39;59:42;"you know, even like the White Album or something."
59:42;59:45;"It's like what I said. If it was just me, I would be choosing Alien Lanes,"
59:45;59:46;"but I wouldn't because I would be..."
59:46;59:51;"That's a pathetic choice because it doesn't have cultural reach."
59:51;59:56;"And yet, it doesn't have cultural reach because the policeman in your head said,"
59:56;59:59;"""You're about to write Alien Lanes,"" and said, ""Jake, you're under arrest."""
59:59;01:00:01;"You almost put something that mattered to you."
01:00:01;01:00:06;"You know what? Alien Lanes, Ezra, Alien Lanes is unelectable."
01:00:06;01:00:11;"Right. You're like, ""Alien Lanes is your Bernie."""
01:00:11;01:00:13;"You're just like..."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"It's unelectable. It's unelectable."
01:00:16;01:00:20;"Listen, man, in a perfect world, I would love to see Alien Lanes top 10."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"It's just not going to happen. It's pie in the sky, Jake."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Throw that off your list and put Pet Sounds, man."
01:00:26;01:00:29;"You're like, ""I never actually throw on Pet Sounds."""
01:00:29;01:00:34;"Jake, just suck it up and put down Pet Sounds and you're just like, ""Yes."""
01:00:34;01:00:39;"Pet Sounds was number two, which was... I was surprised how high that was."
01:00:39;01:00:42;"When we were in the studio and we were like talking about it and we were kind of..."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"There was like some like, ""All right, like scrolling to number one."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"Guess what it's going to be. Guess what's going to be."""
01:00:46;01:00:49;"And I was like, ""Uh, uh."" And I said Pet Sounds."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I knew it wasn't going to be Sardine Pepper for whatever reason."
01:00:51;01:00:57;"And number one, by the way, for anybody listening was Marvin Gaye, What's Going On, right?"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"Yeah, it was."
01:00:58;01:01:00;"When I actually think about my favorite albums of all time,"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"the ones I spent the most time with in my life,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"I think I saw at least one of these albums in there."
01:01:05;01:01:10;"The two albums that I truly was obsessed with at an important time in my life"
01:01:10;01:01:15;"were Something Else and Village Green Preservation Society by The Kinks."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"I think I saw one of them in there."
01:01:16;01:01:20;"I think Village Green was... Oh, no, Something Else was definitely in there."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Maybe they both were."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"Something Else has like Waterloo Sunset on it, right?"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"Yeah. I mean, it is funny. It's like, I wonder..."
01:01:27;01:01:28;"God, I'm glad I didn't fill this out."
01:01:28;01:01:31;"I would have had a breakdown if I had to vote in this election."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Dude, coming in with 50 albums would be hard."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"That's stressful."
01:01:35;01:01:38;"It would take like hours to really like..."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"I literally just... I'm trying to do..."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"With this thought experiment, I'm thinking like,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"""All right, let's just forget about top 50, but top 10."""
01:01:43;01:01:46;"I'm like, ""Would I put a Beatles album in my top 10?"""
01:01:46;01:01:47;"And I'm like stressed out about it."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"It's like..."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"What's your favorite Beatles record?"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"Well, when I was growing up, it might just be because my parents had it."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"Sure."
01:01:54;01:01:57;"I knew Magical Mystery Tour better than a lot of albums."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"I love that record."
01:01:58;01:02:02;"And by the way, if there's any stats geeks listening, Beatles stats geeks,"
01:02:02;01:02:07;"I recognize that Magical Mystery Tour is considered a soundtrack or a compilation"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"and not a studio album."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"Exactly."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"I hear you. I get it."
01:02:10;01:02:14;"Because some of these things were released as singles and blah, blah, blah."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"But whatever. It feels and looks like an album."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"I was limited before I started having my own money to buy CDs"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"to just listen to whatever records my parents had."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"And they didn't have Revolver."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"And they didn't have The White Album."
01:02:25;01:02:29;"I think they had Sgt. Pepper's and Magical Mystery Tour."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"And straight up as a kid, I would throw on..."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"I would choose Magical Mystery Tour over Sgt. Pepper every time."
01:02:35;01:02:38;"I mean, because Magical Mystery Tour had Strawberry Fields Forever."
01:02:38;01:02:42;"The song Magical Mystery Tour is actually an amazing recording."
01:02:42;01:02:42;"Yep."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"That's crazy trumpet with the echo and stuff."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"It's so weird."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Full on the Hill."
01:02:47;01:02:51;"Full on the Hill is like actually a very haunting, dark, weird song."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"What else is on that? Your Mother Should Know."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"Yeah."
01:02:54;01:02:54;"Kind of like..."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Annie Lane."
01:02:55;01:02:58;"No, dude, I prefer Magical Mystery to Pepper."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"This is why we're friends, Jake."
01:03:00;01:03:00;"Man, I can't..."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"Can you believe all these years we've known each other,"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"we're still discovering new things we have in common."
01:03:05;01:03:08;"Oh, yeah. I am the walrus."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Blue Jay Way, which also is the most LA Beatles song"
01:03:12;01:03:17;"because Blue Jay Way is a street in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Yeah."
01:03:18;01:03:18;"The Bird Streets."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"There's a fog upon LA."
01:03:21;01:03:25;"I think people look at Magical Mystery Tour and they're like,"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"""Oh, it's kind of corny."""
01:03:26;01:03:27;"Because it has..."
01:03:27;01:03:31;"There's a strain of Beatles corniness in it with Penny Lane and stuff."
01:03:31;01:03:34;"But if you're willing to interpret a song like Penny Lane"
01:03:34;01:03:38;"as being actually a haunting, sad vision of suburbia,"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"which to me it is,"
01:03:40;01:03:44;"then suddenly this album feels as deep and dark as Sgt. Pepper."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"That song is sad and weird."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs"
01:03:49;01:03:53;"Of every head he's had the pleasure to know"
01:03:53;01:03:57;"And all the people that come and go"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"Stop and say hello"
01:04:00;01:04:06;"On the corner is a banker with a motorcar"
01:04:06;01:04:10;"The little children love him behind his back"
01:04:10;01:04:14;"And the banker never wears a mask"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"In the pouring rain"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Very strange"
01:04:19;01:04:25;"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes"
01:04:25;01:04:34;"There beneath the blue suburban skies"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"I sit and meanwhile back..."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Dude, you know what a fun game is?"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"I don't know if you've ever done this on tour,"
01:04:39;01:04:44;"but have someone try to list the tracks of a Beatles record"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"from by memory?"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"Like Abbey Road, Go."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Can you name all of the tracks in order?"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Oh my God."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Oh my God."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"Dick picked Chicago last year and played with you."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"We were staying in this Airbnb and after the show,"
01:04:57;01:05:01;"we had some like late ass night of like drinks and pizza."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"And then it was like three in the morning."
01:05:02;01:05:05;"We were like, no dude, mean Mr. Mustard."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"And then it goes to Paul Feen's Lamb."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Abbey Road is tough."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"Is track one on Abbey Road, Here Comes the Sun?"
01:05:13;01:05:16;"It depends on the version because my parents had an old vinyl"
01:05:16;01:05:19;"copy where the track one was Here Comes the Sun."
01:05:19;01:05:23;"But then I had like a tape or a CD later where it was Come Together."
01:05:23;01:05:23;"Oh."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"And I noticed that when some of the Beatles records,"
01:05:26;01:05:33;"my parents had copies of Rubber Soul where the first song was I've Just Seen a Face,"
01:05:33;01:05:36;"which on the CD was like Unhelp."
01:05:36;01:05:36;"Yeah."
01:05:36;01:05:40;"Back then the American version would always be different than the UK version"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"and same with the Stones records."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"I can't fully recall."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"Is track one on Revolver Taxman?"
01:05:46;01:05:46;"Yeah."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"What a weird way to kick that album off."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"I'm into it though."
01:05:49;01:05:55;"OK, obviously track one on Sgt Pepper is Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"followed by I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"Track three, I'm drawing a blank actually."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Do you know what track three is?"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"Lucy."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Is Lucy?"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Oh, that's a strong opening."
01:06:05;01:06:10;"I understand why Sgt Pepper is more electable than MMT."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"Of course."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"And also the truth is, I think for a while, if I had to pick my second,"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"because Magical Mystery Tour, that was like my favorite as a kid."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"As an adult, hands down, it's the White Album."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:26;"It's weird and it ties into the Manson murders in a sense."
01:06:26;01:06:26;"Track one."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Back in the USSR."
01:06:28;01:06:28;"Boom."
01:06:28;01:06:35;"This is like the show that people can't do."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"That's what Time Crisis should be from now on."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Just like, can you name?"
01:06:39;01:06:43;"Every time we have a guest, it's just like, can you name a Beatles album,"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"front to back, track list from memory, go."
01:06:45;01:06:48;"Tom O'Neill, welcome to the show."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"We love your new book, Chaos."
01:06:50;01:06:55;"Speaking of Helter Skelter, can you name a Beatle?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"That's a really good game."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"It makes me realize how few I really know."
01:06:58;01:07:03;"Track one on something else, which I claim is one of my favorite records, is David Watts."
01:07:03;01:07:08;"Track two, Death of a Clown maybe."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"It's tough."
01:07:09;01:07:09;"It is tough."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Sorry, which record is this?"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"Something else by the Kinks."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"That's one of those albums that I just somehow missed."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Maybe partially because my friends."
01:07:17;01:07:20;"You ever get into the song Waterloo Sunset?"
01:07:20;01:07:20;"Of course."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Yeah."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"You know what's crazy?"
01:07:23;01:07:28;"I know this is kind of sacrilege, but maybe I should start with something else."
01:07:28;01:07:33;"I've tried to do Kinks full length records and I haven't connected."
01:07:33;01:07:38;"And I love their singles from all different eras, 60s through the 80s."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"But I just haven't."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Right."
01:07:40;01:07:46;"Like I'll throw on like the 8-man one, the one with like Lola on it, or I'll throw on like Village Green."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"There's always like at least four or five great songs."
01:07:49;01:07:54;"But I feel like the ones that aren't great, like are really just like, oh God."
01:07:54;01:07:59;"Like I remember like a year ago throwing in Village Green and like that song is amazing."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"I love that song."
01:08:01;01:08:01;"Right."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"The rest of the record, I was just like tuning it out."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"And I was like, what is wrong with me?"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Like I should love it."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"I like that whole record."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"I could see you finding it a little twee."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Like some of the other songs are weird."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"Like there's a song called Animal Farm."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"It's not like some political commentary."
01:08:16;01:08:19;"It literally is just like this fantasy of living on a farm."
01:08:19;01:08:24;"I actually remember because I liked that album so much reading an article once that was about"
01:08:24;01:08:30;"how Ray Davies like did a show with Yola Tango, or he sat in at some thing they were doing"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"in like Hoboken."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"And he was like, well, what songs do you want to play?"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"And they were naming all these deep cut songs, including Animal Farm."
01:08:37;01:08:38;"And he was like, why the f*ck do you want to play that?"
01:08:38;01:08:42;"He was so alienated by them just being like, oh, sh*t."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"I mean, we got to do Animal Farm."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"He's like, what?"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"Like in his head, he's probably like, I literally haven't thought about that song in 40 years."
01:08:48;01:08:54;"And they're probably stoked to like semi impress him and like show to him like what huge fans"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"they are."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"Right."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"Which means I always go either way with somebody."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"Let's just play Waterloo."
01:08:59;01:08:59;"That's it."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Yeah, let's give the people what they want."
01:10:01;01:10:06;"All right, so there's one again, it's so hard to keep up with all the TC news and the"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"world is just becoming more TC every day."
01:10:09;01:10:13;"There was an announcement about a week and a half ago that was just so TC."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"It was hard to believe it was real."
01:10:15;01:10:20;"There was someone on Twitter that was like, during the pandemic, TC has become this like"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"minority report style, like predictor of future events."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Right, exactly."
01:10:28;01:10:33;"Truly, when we started this five years ago, could we ever imagine the abundance of just"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"TC?"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"I actually just started following, I think somebody must have tagged me."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"I can't imagine how else it came on my radar."
01:10:40;01:10:45;"Somebody tagged me on some account that I started following called Candy Hunting."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"It's a news and media website."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"It's junk food news and some reviews."
01:10:49;01:10:53;"And as I look through it, I'm just kind of like, almost like it's too much."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"I'm literally just gonna like go through their latest posts."
01:10:57;01:11:04;"This is a chip company called Clancy's that's making taquito flavored kettle chips."
01:11:04;01:11:10;"The next one is a Reese's dessert cup called Colliders."
01:11:10;01:11:14;"That's vanilla flavored dessert with Reese's crumbles."
01:11:14;01:11:22;"After that, the same chips company Clancy's is dropping a Bloody Mary and a Moscow Mule"
01:11:22;01:11:23;"flavored kettle chip."
01:11:24;01:11:27;"After that, Reese's, oh, this must be what I got tagged."
01:11:27;01:11:33;"Reese's is dropping a new big cup, peanut butter cup that has pretzels inside the peanut"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"butter."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"There's also a potato chip Reese's."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"There's a gingerbread flavored Oreos."
01:11:40;01:11:42;"There's Cajun fries Pringles."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"There's pumpkin spice latte M&Ms."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"They already had pumpkin spice M&Ms."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Now there's pumpkin spice latte M&Ms."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"Basically, what I'm saying is like, it's endless."
01:11:52;01:11:56;"Like everything you can think of like, oh, there's Dunkin' Donuts cereal."
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Did you guys know about this?"
01:11:58;01:12:02;"One flavor is caramel macchiato and the other flavor is mocha latte."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"And on the front of the box, it says made with Dunkin' coffee."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"What's the target audience for that?"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"35 year olds."
01:12:08;01:12:15;"A 35 year old man children who like, I still like to eat really sugary cereal in the morning,"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"but I'm an adult."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"I also need my cup of coffee."
01:12:18;01:12:22;"If you can tell me that this cereal is made with actual Dunkin' coffee,"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"you're going to save me time."
01:12:23;01:12:28;"In my day, I'll scarf down a huge bowl of caramel macchiato Dunkin' cereal."
01:12:28;01:12:33;"I don't, then I don't need to stop at Dunkin' to get the coffee and I'm ready to go."
01:12:33;01:12:38;"Anyway, so there's these endless collaborations and weird flavors and bizarre junk food."
01:12:38;01:12:44;"And actually, even as we start to talk about it, I'm unsure if I even totally remember."
01:12:44;01:12:49;"What we saw announced was a Mountain Dew margarita, which of course is insane because"
01:12:49;01:12:53;"I know people haven't heard the new Mountain Brews song, Worst Margarita in My Life Yet."
01:12:53;01:12:57;"But if you've been listening to the show, you followed at least partially the genesis of it."
01:12:57;01:13:01;"And I think we did, we actually read through the lyrics on the show."
01:13:01;01:13:02;"And so I know this song very well."
01:13:02;01:13:05;"I've been listening to the demo a lot."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"I think it's definitely, it's a top three brew song."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"I think long-term, it might be tied with the song Mountain Brews for like,"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"most iconic brews tune."
01:13:13;01:13:15;"Is that the feedback you're getting, Jake?"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Uh, I think it's a little early to say."
01:13:17;01:13:20;"Mountain Brews, the song was just a runaway hit."
01:13:20;01:13:23;"So, we'll have to see what the people have to say."
01:13:23;01:13:27;"But you and Danielle adding your vocal magic is not going to hurt."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"To Worst Margarita."
01:13:28;01:13:28;"Yeah."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Hopefully."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Proud to be a part of it."
01:13:31;01:13:36;"Anyway, there's the line in Worst Margarita of My Life, where the narrator, the Jake character,"
01:13:36;01:13:40;"sips the margarita and realizes how terrible it is and says,"
01:13:40;01:13:45;"""I swear it was flat mountain dew mixed with tequila for a noxious brew."""
01:13:46;01:13:49;"So, I've been listening to this song for like a couple months now,"
01:13:49;01:13:54;"and then to see they're announced a mountain dew, dewgarita with Saigo."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And this is where I get confused."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"Is this exclusively at Red Lobster?"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Yes, this is just at Red Lobster."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Yeah, this is under a mandate."
01:14:01;01:14:04;"There's always got to be that third element these days that makes no sense."
01:14:04;01:14:10;"But it adds another layer of heaviness with TC, because if you recall a few months ago,"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"I did the Red Lobster/Darden Restaurant Group Deep Dive."
01:14:14;01:14:15;"Right."
01:14:15;01:14:20;"I think if you made a map of Time Crisis and you traced times Jake talked about,"
01:14:20;01:14:24;"Red Lobster, margaritas, and mountain dew,"
01:14:24;01:14:28;"and you visualized it on a pinboard and you connected the yarn,"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"it would actually form a pentagram."
01:14:30;01:14:35;"And this is the pentagram that summoned this from the dark world into existence."
01:14:35;01:14:41;"Is it possible that Time Crisis has willed a sort of like"
01:14:41;01:14:47;"tier of listeners that comes from the corporate food development and marketing world,"
01:14:47;01:14:52;"where there is a dialogue now between the show and the industry?"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"Or am I giving us too much credit?"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I feel like the turnaround is probably a little fast."
01:14:56;01:15:05;"I bet Red Lobster and Mountain Dew and PepsiCo Corporation/Frito-Lay/Darden"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"Restaurant Group were talking about this a year ago."
01:15:09;01:15:13;"You don't think that there's a version of at, what was the name of our"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"Millennial Mad Men? Is it Drago 5?"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"Droga. Droga 5."
01:15:18;01:15:24;"At Droga 5, there's some Vassar grad and he's about to go into his Red Lobster meeting"
01:15:24;01:15:27;"and he has nothing planned and he's killing time."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"He's jamming some TC on the bus."
01:15:29;01:15:33;"He's jamming some TC and he's like, ""Oh my God, in the last minute,"
01:15:33;01:15:36;"the 11th hour, he's got nothing there."
01:15:36;01:15:39;"He's standing at a table in front of all of the Red Lobsters."""
01:15:39;01:15:41;"I love it."
01:15:41;01:15:45;"Randy, you've been awfully quiet the past few weeks, man."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"You are not pulling your weight here."
01:15:46;01:15:49;"Give me one reason not to fire you, man."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"Just give me a halfway decent idea."
01:15:51;01:15:55;"And he just stammers out like, ""Mountain Dew Margarita?"
01:15:55;01:15:59;"We take some flat Mountain Dew and mix it with tequila for an oxygen brew?"""
01:16:02;01:16:04;"The worst Dewgarita."
01:16:04;01:16:13;"Zio's just like, ""Okay, maybe I wasn't out of my goddamn mind when I hired you in the"
01:16:13;01:16:14;"first place."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"This is what I'm talking about."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"Thank you, Randy."""
01:16:16;01:16:21;"Well, also during COVID, I don't know if people are actually eating at Red Lobster,"
01:16:21;01:16:26;"so it could be totally possible that the Dewgarita is like a Travis Scott McRib short"
01:16:26;01:16:29;"situation where it doesn't actually exist."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"Where the Dewgarita is just a concept."
01:16:32;01:16:36;"Seinfeld, how much are Dewgaritas going for on StockX right now?"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Oh my God."
01:16:37;01:16:44;"You could probably Postmates a Dewgarita, though, right?"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Yeah, no."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"They could put in a styrofoam or something."
01:16:47;01:16:48;"Wasn't there a whole..."
01:16:48;01:16:52;"Maybe the reason I did the Red Lobster history segment a few months ago was because..."
01:16:52;01:16:55;"Wasn't there a fight around Mother's Day?"
01:16:55;01:16:55;"Yes."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Red Lobster."
01:16:57;01:17:02;"There were a bunch of very angry, rude people who were making life a living hell for the"
01:17:02;01:17:07;"Red Lobster employees because it was taking a long time to get the food or something."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Yeah."
01:17:08;01:17:08;"Right."
01:17:08;01:17:13;"It was all to go and people were waiting up to three or four hours for to-go orders from"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"a Red Lobster."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Because COVID, quarantine had just started, right?"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"So there were all these new guidelines."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"It was frustrating."
01:17:22;01:17:22;"Yeah."
01:17:22;01:17:28;"I think what the Dewgarita is missing is that Jake should be the Travis Scott character"
01:17:28;01:17:29;"in this."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Obviously, Red Lobster is probably hurting."
01:17:31;01:17:35;"They're like, ""We need to throw some crazy ideas out there to make some waves and remind"
01:17:35;01:17:38;"people that we exist and give them a reason to come through."""
01:17:38;01:17:39;"So yeah, Dewgarita."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Okay."
01:17:40;01:17:41;"It's a great idea."
01:17:41;01:17:42;"It got people talking."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"We're talking about it."
01:17:43;01:17:47;"Of course, I want to try it or I need to try it, actually, for work."
01:17:47;01:17:51;"For us on Time Crisis, it's a tax write-off, by the way, to try Dewgarita."
01:17:51;01:17:56;"But what they're missing is that personality or at least that outside brand, the Travis"
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Scott, in this case."
01:17:57;01:17:58;"That's what it should be."
01:17:58;01:18:02;"When you get that email from Red Lobster, if you're on their email list, you want it"
01:18:02;01:18:07;"to start with, ""We're teaming up with Mountain Dew, an American painter and radio personality,"
01:18:07;01:18:11;"John ""Jake"" Pullman Longstra to bring you the Dewgarita."""
01:18:11;01:18:12;"Now I'm interested."
01:18:12;01:18:13;"Now I've got a lot of things floating around."
01:18:13;01:18:18;"Dewgarita on its own is just like, it doesn't have the Travis Scott magic."
01:18:18;01:18:25;"Obscure but revered American band Mountain Brews has teamed up with Red Lobster and Frito"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"Lay Corporation."
01:19:18;01:19:24;"Can I just point out that this is the first of many collaborations to come between PepsiCo"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"and Red Lobster?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"I'm just reading this article."
01:19:27;01:19:31;"Yeah, and there's a Business Insider article on the Dewgarita that says, ""The brands are"
01:19:31;01:19:37;"working together to co-create more 'tasty' menu items using Frito Lay and Quaker products."""
01:19:37;01:19:41;"And then there's a quote from Red Lobster's Senior Vice President that says, ""Red Lobster"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"is thrilled to work with PepsiCo, not only because it has a great portfolio of brands,"
01:19:45;01:19:50;"but specifically because of the food and beverage innovation possibilities."
01:19:50;01:19:56;"The Dewgarita is the first delicious taste of the types of inspired menu items to come."""
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Have they announced any of the other ones?"
01:19:58;01:19:59;"Not yet."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"You know what I actually bet they will do?"
01:20:01;01:20:02;"I'm calling it right now."
01:20:02;01:20:05;"There will be a Flamin' Hot whatever."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Flamin' Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuit?"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"Flamin' Red Hot Lobster?"
01:20:11;01:20:15;"No, I love the Flamin' Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuit."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"The biscuit, for sure."
01:20:16;01:20:20;"A Flamin' Hot Lobster would actually be hilarious, but I think realistically, I could see Flamin'"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"Hot Cheddar Bay Biscuits being real."
01:20:23;01:20:30;"Also, picture you're the person just working at Red Lobster part-time, and I have my very"
01:20:30;01:20:34;"brief experience working at Quiznos, so I can kind of imagine it."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"I'm sure somebody else would have a better picture of it."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"But all right, you've been working at Red Lobster for a while, you know the basics."
01:20:39;01:20:44;"There's probably seven menu items that are the top sellers, so you know what to do."
01:20:44;01:20:48;"I wonder how it works when there's some new bulls**t like the Dewgarita."
01:20:48;01:20:54;"Do they have to send out regional manager types to be like, ""Everybody, you're coming"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"in early."
01:20:55;01:21:00;"I need everybody in here 7 a.m. on Sunday because we're doing a two-hour Dewgarita workshop."
01:21:00;01:21:05;"This is a real priority from corporate, and I can't have any of you knuckleheads f**king"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"up the Dewgarita."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Cheddar Bay Biscuits, you got that dialed in."
01:21:08;01:21:10;"You know how to get those piping fresh."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Now we're doing Flamin' Hot."
01:21:11;01:21:15;"How do I-- okay, is this the type of situation where they make a corporate video?"
01:21:15;01:21:18;"It's like, ""Hey, what's up, guys?"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"We've all been making Cheddar Bay Biscuits for years."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Now you're telling me they gotta be Flamin' Hot?"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"How does that work?"""
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Well, here's the thing, guys."
01:21:24;01:21:25;"We create a little acronym."
01:21:25;01:21:30;"They have to teach everybody how to do the funny little-- I guess it's like a coffee"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"place, it's probably easy."
01:21:32;01:21:37;"You get a job at Starbucks in April and then come late September, they're like, ""Okay,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"by the way, now it's pumpkin spice latte time."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"Basically, two pumps and a regular latte of this bulls**t."""
01:21:44;01:21:46;"And you're kind of like, ""Okay, got it."""
01:21:46;01:21:48;"But the Dewgarita, I wonder."
01:21:48;01:21:55;"I would say the Dewgarita and the fictionalized Flamin' Hot Cheddar Biscuit, it's all standardized"
01:21:55;01:21:55;"stuff coming--"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"We got an acronym."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"When you're in there, it is A, B, C, D."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"Always be Cheddar-dusted."
01:22:01;01:22:07;"Always be Cheddar-dusted."
01:22:07;01:22:09;"Like, so Jake, you think it's like--"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"It's all pre-made."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"So like--"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"So they want to minimize human error."
01:22:13;01:22:17;"That it's like the way that the Dewgarita works, it's probably like, ""How does the"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Dewgarita work?"""
01:22:18;01:22:23;"It's just like the regular margarita, except instead of taking the margarita box of sludge"
01:22:23;01:22:27;"that we normally use, you're going to want to take the one that's labeled Dewgarita Sludge."
01:22:27;01:22:34;"If you put the sludge in and it appears to be a normal margarita color, more of a yellow--"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"Well, what color is the Dewgarita, by the way?"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"Is it blue for some reason?"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"No, no, no."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"It's your classic Gatorade lime green."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"Oh, it's green."
01:22:42;01:22:42;"Right."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"So it's not yellow."
01:22:44;01:22:50;"Is that because while Mountain Dew is yellow, the can is green?"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"Wait, now I'm actually tripping."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"What color is Mountain Dew?"
01:22:53;01:22:54;"Isn't Mountain Dew yellow?"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"It's like the same color as Gatorade."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"But its colorway is green."
01:22:58;01:22:59;"But that's what I'm saying."
01:22:59;01:23:05;"If they made it green, is it because it's more iconic to look like the plastic label?"
01:23:05;01:23:09;"The images they provide of the Dewgarita, the liquid appears to be green."
01:23:09;01:23:13;"Yeah, and as I recall, the liquid of Mountain Dew is actually like--"
01:23:13;01:23:16;"It's green, but it's not as green as the bottle."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"Is the Dewgarita available?"
01:23:17;01:23:22;"If we get on Postmates and try to order some food from the Red Lobster in Burbank,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"is the Dewgarita on the menu?"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"I just tried to do that, and Red Lobster was out of range for me."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"So I couldn't--"
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Hold on."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"Is there one in Burbank?"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Should we try to call Red Lobster?"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"Wait, there's one in Pasadena."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"Matt, can you call the Pasadena Red Lobster?"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Yeah, I'll try it."
01:23:40;01:23:40;"Hang on."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"I just had an idea."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"We should start our own soda called Morning Dew."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Ooh."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Ooh."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"I don't know what we do with it, but it's like--"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"and they try to come for us."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"We're like, man, it's [BLEEP] Morning Dew."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"It's like the phrase is old as time."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"You got your Mountain Dew."
01:23:54;01:23:55;"We got Morning Dew."
01:23:55;01:23:57;"And it's beer and Mountain Dew."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"Is it a Mountain Brew's beer called Morning Dew?"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"Or does it have to be called Mountain Brew?"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"We start two things."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"We start a soda called Morning Dew and a beer called Mountain Brew."
01:24:05;01:24:09;"I'm looking at the Red Lobster Margarita menu right now."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"No Dewgarita listed."
01:24:11;01:24:12;"Really?"
01:24:12;01:24:13;"Well, it's a little unclear where--"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"it's like just like the Yelp--"
01:24:15;01:24:15;"oh, no, no."
01:24:15;01:24:19;"It's the Pasadena Red Lobster menu on Yelp."
01:24:19;01:24:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"Yelp, that could easily not be updated."
01:24:22;01:24:28;"The Dewgarita will be available nationwide by the end of 2020, according to a press release."
01:24:28;01:24:28;"That's vague."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"So I just called, and they do not have it."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"OK."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"They don't carry the Dewgarita."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"They don't have the Dewgarita."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"She wasn't even totally sure what it was, to be totally honest."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"All right, well, there you go."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"It's going to take them a while."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"I mean, that's why you need really efficient corporate structure."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"I mean, they shouldn't be advertising until it's actually available."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"Because that kind of stuff--"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Yeah, they just want to make a splash."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"They just want to make a splash."
01:24:52;01:24:56;"I wonder if there's any-- how it's worked out with McDonald's."
01:24:56;01:25:00;"If there's anywhere in the country, like some really rural McDonald's where somebody"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"rolled up and was like, I'd like the Travis Scott meal Cactus Jack sent me."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"And they're just like, what the f*ck did you just say?"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"They're like, I want the Travis Scott meal."
01:25:08;01:25:11;"And they're like, I have no idea what you're talking about."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"What do you want?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"I want the Travis Scott meal."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"And they're like, sir, what do you want?"
01:25:15;01:25:18;"He's like, OK, I want a Sprite and a--"
01:25:18;01:25:18;"like, all right, thank you."
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Like, they literally never heard of it."
01:25:20;01:25:24;"Or is McDonald's so dialed in that everybody knows?"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"I think it's possible that there's some McDonald's"
01:25:26;01:25:30;"in out of the way places that are not dialed in yet."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"I mean, because there's so many McDonald's."
01:25:32;01:25:32;"Well, here's a question."
01:25:32;01:25:36;"Is the Travis Scott meal a global initiative?"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"Or is it America only?"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"Because you roll up--"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"Oh, that's a very good question."
01:25:39;01:25:44;"--a Ukrainian McDonald's and be like, you know, give me the Travis Scott."
01:25:44;01:25:47;"Or is it like a regional version of the Travis Scott?"
01:25:47;01:25:51;"Well, also, yeah, McDonald's menus are very different around the world."
01:25:51;01:25:56;"Like, famously in India, most Indian McDonald's, I think, don't actually have beef."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"Sure."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"So you could imagine that it could be problematic"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"trying to figure out this Travis Scott meal globally."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"The worst do-gar-ita."
01:26:06;01:26:12;"That song is specifically about somebody who actually loves do-gar-itas."
01:26:12;01:26:17;"They just happen to be at one Red Lobster that didn't have it dialed in yet."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"I've had many do-gar-itas, and this one is not good."
01:26:20;01:26:27;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:26:27;01:26:31;"This week on the Top 5, Jake, why don't you explain this?"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"You made an executive decision to do something kind of special."
01:26:35;01:26:39;"Well, speaking of the do-gar-ita, friend of the show Daniel Ralston"
01:26:40;01:26:44;"sent me a song, a new Luke Bryan song today called ""One Margarita."""
01:26:44;01:26:49;"It's just about dudes on a boat,"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"like just getting hammered on a boat drinking margaritas and doing shots."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"And the song's called ""One Margarita?"""
01:26:55;01:26:55;"Yeah."
01:26:55;01:27:00;"One margarita, two margarita, three margarita shot."
01:27:00;01:27:00;"Oh, okay."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"Something, something, something, something, something, something, on the floating dock."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"It's a great song."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"It's really not that far from a Mountain Brew song."
01:27:09;01:27:11;"And then we were just texting back and forth today, and he was like,"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"""Dude, what if you did a country Top 5?"""
01:27:13;01:27:15;"And I was like, ""That's kind of a tight call."""
01:27:15;01:27:16;"Oh, okay."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"Shout out to Daniel Ralston."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"That's a great call."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"I was like, ""Yeah, contemporary country Top 5."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"I mean, why not?"""
01:27:22;01:27:26;"Yeah, sometimes we get country in the Top 5, but yeah, we ought to go."

01:30:16;01:30:19;"- Boaters, his boater votes. - Boaters."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"- So the country is surrounded by water."
01:30:22;01:30:24;"So there's coasts and boats and everywhere."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"There's lakes everywhere,"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"but getting (beep) faced down at the lake."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"I guess that's why I asked about the floating dock."
01:30:30;01:30:32;"Is that like somehow like a country thing?"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"- Well, yeah. - Floating dock at the-"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"- I'm also not a boat person."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"So I was wondering about that too."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"Like, did he mean like the sort of like classic dock"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"that was like offshore that you could like swim to?"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"Or does he just mean a dock"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"that's actually moored to the shore?"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"- You get sort of a catwalk out."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And it's sort of a square dock"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"that is anchored in."
01:30:52;01:30:57;"So it's floating and you basically go hang there, go tubing."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"You go get a lounge chair."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"- It's attached to the regular dock?"
01:31:02;01:31:05;"- Yes, but it's usually like floating in from like a lake."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"You know, if you have a house on a lake"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"and you go and get a little catwalk out"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"and then yeah, you'll probably tie your boats"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"or your canoes or whatever to that."
01:31:14;01:31:17;"But it is sort of a square, you can picture it."
01:31:17;01:31:18;"- No, I understand what you're saying"
01:31:18;01:31:21;"'cause old school docks would have been actually like,"
01:31:21;01:31:25;"there would have been footers into the actual ground"
01:31:25;01:31:26;"at the bottom of the lake."
01:31:26;01:31:29;"You know, like an old wooden dock."
01:31:29;01:31:33;"There'd be like fence posts driven down into the mud"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"at the lake's bottom."
01:31:34;01:31:37;"Does that kind of dock imply more of like"
01:31:37;01:31:41;"an old money genteel New England waspy kind of lake?"
01:31:41;01:31:45;"And the floating dock implies more of a kind of"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"Kenny Powers, like let's get (beep) face vibe?"
01:31:47;01:31:48;"- Right, some sort of like, yeah,"
01:31:48;01:31:52;"like dock with like a flotation under the deck."
01:31:52;01:31:56;"- By the way, guys, I'm actually thinking this might be,"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"'cause that is a floating dock, what we're talking about."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"But when I look it up now,"
01:31:59;01:32:02;"I'm actually seeing these sort of very large,"
01:32:02;01:32:06;"square inflatable docks, I guess,"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"where they would go out on the lake"
01:32:08;01:32:11;"and you'd put your chairs on them, sort of like floaties."
01:32:11;01:32:13;"- Like you're in the middle of the lake."
01:32:13;01:32:14;"- Like you're in the middle of the lake"
01:32:14;01:32:17;"on a giant inflatable square."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"- So you like swim out there?"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"- Yeah, you'd swim out there,"
01:32:19;01:32:23;"or you'd literally sit on chairs, get sort of pushed out,"
01:32:23;01:32:27;"and now you're floating on in your chairs with your igloo,"
01:32:27;01:32:30;"and you're just drinking beer, hopping off and getting on."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"I guess it's, you know,"
01:32:32;01:32:35;"I mean, it's what I'm looking at I've never seen before."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"And it looks fun."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"- I think Luke Bryan is talking about"
01:32:40;01:32:44;"sort of newer dock technology that we're not hip to."
01:32:44;01:32:45;"- Yes."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"- I know that there's a, well, it's not a lake,"
01:32:47;01:32:50;"but I know we played at the festival"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"called Hangout in Alabama."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"That was actually a time where we played"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"right before Travis Scott, matter of fact."
01:32:55;01:32:56;"And that's a great festival."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"It's like right on the beach."
01:32:58;01:33:01;"And the area of Alabama,"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"and I guess also the Florida Panhandle,"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"I remember we flew in and out of Pensacola."
01:33:05;01:33:09;"People referred to it as the Redneck Riviera."
01:33:09;01:33:10;"- Right."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"- So I guess maybe, is there a,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"I'm truly grasping in the dark here,"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"but I wonder if this is a thing"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"where there's like some like old school lake in Connecticut,"
01:33:19;01:33:22;"where there's like these like beautiful stately old homes,"
01:33:22;01:33:25;"and everybody has like their, you know, classic docks,"
01:33:25;01:33:30;"and like, you know, some new money, family moves in,"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"and they kind of like go to all the neighborhood"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"lake association, like,"
01:33:33;01:33:36;"""Hey guys, we should get a floating dock"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"in the middle of the lake."
01:33:37;01:33:38;"Hey, you know what?"
01:33:38;01:33:39;"We'll even foot the bill."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"We could all party there."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"It's something fun for the whole neighborhood."""
01:33:42;01:33:44;"And people are just like,"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"""Sir, this is Connecticut."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"We will never have a floating dock."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Our docks are made out of wood,"
01:33:51;01:33:54;"and they have poles that go down to the bottom of the lake."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"And yes, we might, you know,"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"toss back a few martinis there,"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"but we will certainly never float on a dock"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"to the middle of the lake"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"and drink three margaritas in a shot."""
01:34:04;01:34:06;"Is this a dichotomy that exists?"
01:34:06;01:34:09;"- I mean, it depends on what part of Connecticut you're in,"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"'cause there's definitely redneck parts of Connecticut,"
01:34:11;01:34:14;"and then there's definitely the hoity-toity parts of CT."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"- Right, that's the big secret of America,"
01:34:16;01:34:20;"is that there's stuck up old money rich people"
01:34:20;01:34:24;"and rednecks literally everywhere."
01:34:24;01:34:26;"It's not a North versus South thing."
01:34:26;01:34:27;"- No."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"- We've been jawboning for a while,"
01:34:28;01:34:32;"so what we're gonna do right now,"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"rather than do a comparison,"
01:34:33;01:34:36;"we're gonna get into the top five country songs"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"on the country streaming charts."
01:34:38;01:34:43;"And that means that it's not necessarily the newest ones,"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"because with streaming, you get all sorts of stuff."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"So actually, interestingly,"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"let's kick it off with number five."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"The number five most streamed country song this week,"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Chris Stapleton, ""Tennessee Whiskey."""
01:34:53;01:34:55;"This song came out in 2015."
01:34:55;01:34:58;"So Chris Stapleton really doing his damn thing."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"I feel like we heard this song"
01:35:01;01:35:04;"when we first started ""Time Crisis."""
01:35:04;01:35:06;"You know Chris Stapleton, Jake?"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"- Yeah, I'm aware."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"- So, oh, I guess this is an old song."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"It was written in 1981."
01:35:10;01:35:18;"- It was first recorded by American country artist"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"David Allen Coe."
01:35:20;01:35:22;"- Famous bad boy of country."
01:35:22;01:35:26;"- Well, his son is the guy that hosts ""Cocaine and Rhinestones."""
01:35:26;01:35:27;"- Oh, really?"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"- Did you ever check out that podcast?"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"- No, I remember you talking about it."
01:35:30;01:35:32;"- It's really good."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"And his son is, yeah, I think his name is Tyler Coe."
01:35:36;01:35:39;"Very opinionated on Twitter too about country music."
01:35:39;01:35:40;"- Yeah."
01:35:40;01:35:42;"- Not a fan of Luke Bryan, incidentally."
01:35:42;01:35:43;"- Oh, really?"
01:35:43;01:35:44;"- Yeah."
01:35:45;01:35:49;"♪ And brought me back ♪"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"♪ Been too far gone ♪"
01:35:53;01:35:56;"- So I wonder why this song is still five years later,"
01:35:56;01:35:57;"like on the top five."
01:35:57;01:36:00;"- Yeah, I mean, I remember hearing this song back in the day"
01:36:00;01:36:03;"and I was struck by like, okay, Chris Stapleton,"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"I think people like him because he's like,"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"he feels like throwback in a sense."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"- Yeah."
01:36:09;01:36:12;"- This song doesn't actually sound like old country to me."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"It sounds like old R&B."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"- Right."
01:36:15;01:36:19;"- But I mean, he's a great singer, he sings his ass off."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"And I think his vibe, you know, he's got like a big beard"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"and I think he's seen as kind of like an antidote"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"to Luke Bryan's stuff."
01:36:25;01:36:25;"- Yeah."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"- It's actually interesting to compare this song"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"to ""One Margarita."""
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Even just what he's referencing,"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"Tennessee whiskey, it's like old school, old America,"
01:36:36;01:36:39;"old South versus margaritas."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"- Even when, I think that's--"
01:36:40;01:36:42;"- I wonder if we can get like a graph"
01:36:42;01:36:45;"that tracks margaritas and country music over time."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Yeah, what were you gonna say, Jake?"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"- I was gonna say, even in 1981,"
01:36:48;01:36:52;"this song when it was written was decidedly retro."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"- Right, you're as sweet as strawberry wine."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"- Back to your question, it's sort of like,"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"what was the first country song"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"that referenced a margarita?"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"- Yeah, because I think Jimmy Buffett,"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"you know, his music is definitely country influence,"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"but when he was singing about margaritas in the '70s,"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"he was probably seen as some kind of more of this like,"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"fun singer-songwriter guy,"
01:37:12;01:37:16;"whereas like Luke Bryan is decidedly a country artist."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"That's his world."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"- Yes."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"- Yeah, I wonder if like margaritas back then"
01:37:20;01:37:23;"just didn't read as like a real like country drink."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"- I'm gonna do a little deep digging,"
01:37:25;01:37:29;"but I have to think that those Texas country artists"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"like Waylon Jennings and everyone would have talked about,"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"you know, you're in border town,"
01:37:33;01:37:34;"and there has to be something."
01:37:34;01:37:38;"- No, I know, definitely maybe referencing tequila,"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"but not margarita."
01:37:39;01:37:43;"- There's some of that like left of center, smaller name,"
01:37:43;01:37:46;"Austin, Texas-based country stuff."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Like what's that guy's name?"
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Like Jerry Jeff James or something."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"- Oh, Jerry Jeff Walker?"
01:37:51;01:37:54;"- I feel like there was a time where he lived in Austin,"
01:37:54;01:37:59;"and there was like a scene of these country guys."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"And I kind of remember one of them having this song"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"about like, there's like a famous bar in Austin,"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"where I think they have something called"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"like Mad Dog Margaritas."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"- Oh yeah, there's a bar in Austin"
01:38:09;01:38:13;"called Texas Chili Parlor,"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"and they serve something called a Mad Dog Margarita."
01:38:16;01:38:19;"And Guy Clark wrote a song about that."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"But that was like in the '90s, I think."
01:38:20;01:38:24;"Guy Clark is kind of like a real writer's writer."
01:38:24;01:38:29;"- Yeah, like a Rodney Crowell or like a Townes Van Zandt."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"He probably actually would have maybe had a drink"
01:38:32;01:38:35;"with Townes Van Zandt in like 1979 or something."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"And he has a song where he references Mad Dog Margaritas."
01:38:38;01:38:40;"But even, yeah, again, it's like,"
01:38:40;01:38:41;"I don't think you could call him"
01:38:41;01:38:44;"like a mainstream country act like Luke Bryan."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"- Do you know the history of the margarita?"
01:38:46;01:38:47;"- No."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"Does it actually come from Mexico?"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"- Yeah, one of the earliest stories"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"is the margarita being invented in 1938"
01:38:53;01:38:58;"by Carlos Danny Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria,"
01:38:58;01:39:04;"halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California."
01:39:04;01:39:04;"- Oh."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"- Created for the customer"
01:39:06;01:39:09;"and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King,"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"who was allergic to many spirits, but not tequila."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"- Margaritas are a great drink."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"Wait, did we talk about this last time, Jake?"
01:39:15;01:39:16;"You don't actually like margaritas?"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"Is that part of the story?"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"- No, that's not true."
01:39:19;01:39:22;"I'm actually sort of having one right now."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"- Really?"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"Just made your own?"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"- I've kind of made my own, just mezcal and lime"
01:39:26;01:39:29;"and a little like simple syrup."
01:39:29;01:39:30;"I mean, it's basically a margarita."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"It's just a very simple, you know."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"I like margaritas."
01:39:33;01:39:36;"I just don't like them when they're too sweet"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"and obviously the whole debacle at Dodd Stadium."
01:39:39;01:39:40;"- Yeah, right, fair."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"- Here's a question."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"How do you think I could get,"
01:39:44;01:39:46;"once we finally record and release"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Worst Margarita of My Life,"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"I want to get it to Luke Bryan"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"and see if he would record it."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"- Whoa, that's a great idea."
01:39:53;01:39:55;"- Just have it cross his desk."
01:39:55;01:39:56;"- I guarantee you I could get it to cross"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"at least his manager's desk."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"- All right."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"- Wait, now that I'm thinking about it,"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"in Worst Margarita of My Life,"
01:40:02;01:40:03;"you don't actually specify"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"that you're at Dodger Stadium, right?"
01:40:05;01:40:06;"- No."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"- Okay, that's good because I could picture"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"you get it to some country dude"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"and he's like, ""What is this LA (beep)?"""
01:40:11;01:40:13;"But anybody could relate to going to a ball game"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"and getting a (beep) margarita."
01:40:15;01:40:16;"- Yeah."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"- Getting taken advantage of by a team"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"that doesn't give a (beep) about the fans."
01:40:20;01:40:21;"All right, I mean, we might have to cast a wide net."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"If Luke Bryan passes, we should have some backups."
01:40:25;01:40:28;"- I think this is gonna be a fun ongoing project for TC."
01:40:28;01:40:31;"Get it covered by a contemporary country artist."
01:40:31;01:40:34;"- Who's the Body Like a Backroad guy?"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"- Yeah, he'd be a good choice."
01:40:35;01:40:38;"- I thought that was Florida, Georgia."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"- No, but they'd be a good one."
01:40:39;01:40:42;"Body Like a Backroad is Shane Carruthers."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"- Nope."
01:40:44;01:40:45;"(laughing)"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"- Sam Hunt."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"- Sam Hunt, Matt said."
01:40:48;01:40:49;"- Sam Hunt."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"- Travis Scott, the country one, not the rapper one."
01:40:52;01:40:53;"- Yeah, that'd be amazing."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"- Hi, my name is Travis Scott,"
01:40:55;01:40:56;"not the rapper, the country one."
01:40:56;01:40:59;"And this is my new song, The Worst Margarita of My Life."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"But you know what, Jake?"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Actually, I don't think it's that crazy."
01:41:03;01:41:05;"I feel like Jimmy Buffett is actually always looking"
01:41:05;01:41:08;"for new songs to add to his show."
01:41:08;01:41:09;"- Oh, wow."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"- I think I could get it to Jimmy Buffett"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"and just be like, listen, man,"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"maybe you feel like you got enough margarita songs,"
01:41:14;01:41:15;"but this is a real good one"
01:41:15;01:41:18;"by an American painter, radio personality,"
01:41:18;01:41:19;"and musician, Jake Longstreth."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"You know, and maybe I could picture him being like,"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"man, I like this song, let me throw it in the set."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"'Cause I've gone deep on Jimmy Buffett's set list"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"in the past, and it's like, you know,"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"he obviously plays the hits,"
01:41:28;01:41:31;"but he likes to mix things up and do some covers."
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Like, I feel like Jimmy Buffett definitely would like,"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"drop a Kokomo here and there,"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"or he might come across a fun song"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"that he thinks his fans might like"
01:41:38;01:41:41;"and play it on a summer tour."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"I really don't think that's crazy."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"- I'd love to hear like an auto-tuned version of it."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"- We're gonna make this happen."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"- Yeah, okay, ongoing TC project."
01:41:48;01:41:52;"- Okay, so the number four song is Morgan Wallen"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"with the song Seven Summers."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"And actually, I think Morgan Wallen"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"just had kind of a hit with Diplo."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"See if you like the timbre of this guy's voice, Jake,"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"because I could pass the song to Diplo"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"and see if you could get it to Morgan Wallen."
01:42:07;01:42:12;"Whoa, this feels like we're listening"
01:42:12;01:42:16;"to another classic 1978 top five."
01:42:16;01:42:17;"- Yeah."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"- I'm waiting for like a Gibb brother to come in."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"- Yeah."

01:43:45;01:43:47;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:43:47;01:43:50;"- I mean, he's singing about six packs and Southern Comfort."
01:43:50;01:43:54;"Seven Summers is a great title, by the way."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"- This guy should cover Worst Margarita"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"and Mac DeMarco should cover this song."
01:43:58;01:44:02;"- And Mac DeMarco should?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"- I could just say that."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"- Totally."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"- Oh yeah."
01:44:06;01:44:07;"♪ Back then you used to love the river ♪"
01:44:07;01:44:10;"- Well, I've noticed somethings in this song."
01:44:10;01:44:13;"He's talking about back then you used to love the river."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"Obviously I'm talking out of my ass a lot,"
01:44:15;01:44:18;"but there's something about country and water"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"that I don't fully understand."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"So I wanna understand,"
01:44:21;01:44:25;"'cause there's a lot of lakes and rivers in country music."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"I feel like in country music,"
01:44:26;01:44:30;"people are always going down and jumping the river and (beep)"
01:44:30;01:44:30;"which may be the hardest part."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"- I mean, it's not that hard to understand."
01:44:32;01:44:35;"It is so hot in the South."
01:44:35;01:44:35;"- That you gotta jump in the river."
01:44:35;01:44:37;"- The summers are brutal,"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"that when you're by a body of water,"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"a lake or a river, you get in."
01:44:42;01:44:42;"- What do you think it means?"
01:44:42;01:44:45;"In this song, he's implying that he's a little bit"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"from the wrong side of the tracks."
01:44:47;01:44:48;"And this is his former love,"
01:44:48;01:44:51;"seven summers ago they were together,"
01:44:51;01:44:52;"their lives diverged."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"And he's saying, I bet your dad is so happy"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"you didn't end up with me."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"And kind of implying that maybe she's from"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"a more upper crust background or something,"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"or he's just like a bad boy."
01:45:02;01:45:03;"And when he says,"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"you probably got a big old diamond on your hand right now,"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"that kind of implies like,"
01:45:06;01:45:09;"oh, you probably ended up with like country club dude,"
01:45:09;01:45:12;"rich guy, whereas I'm just a good old boy."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"So he says, he's talking about the past and he says,"
01:45:14;01:45:17;"back then you used to love the river."
01:45:17;01:45:18;"Maybe he's just trying to like--"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"- No, I think back then,"
01:45:20;01:45:23;"before she was fine,"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"kind of slumming it with a river rat."
01:45:25;01:45:29;"- Right, because I guess that's what my question is."
01:45:29;01:45:31;"People who jump in the river,"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"that implies that they're like"
01:45:32;01:45:35;"from the wrong side of the tracks."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"You're a river rat if you jump in the river."
01:45:37;01:45:40;"- You don't have access to the country clubs in ground pool."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"- Right."
01:45:42;01:45:45;"Yeah, you're on a floating dock,"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"hopping in a river,"
01:45:47;01:45:50;"parked up outside in your truck with a sixer."
01:45:50;01:45:52;"And like, it's just a different,"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"yeah, it's not the country club vibe."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"So back then she was okay with the river."
01:45:56;01:45:59;"Now she's probably on, you know, got a private pool."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"- You're married to a lawyer."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"He'll probably be a judge one day."
01:46:04;01:46:07;"And you guys go to the country club"
01:46:07;01:46:10;"and you wouldn't be caught dead"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"wearing a pair of jean shorts"
01:46:12;01:46:15;"in the inner tube on the river with me."
01:46:15;01:46:15;"That's sad."
01:46:15;01:46:19;"- Anytime a country song mentions a sixer,"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"they should just make it a 12er."
01:46:21;01:46:25;"'Cause a sixer is just gonna be gone."
01:46:25;01:46:27;"If there's like two or three people,"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"I mean, if there's three people,"
01:46:29;01:46:30;"that's two beers each,"
01:46:30;01:46:33;"that sixer is gone in like 20 minutes, half hour."
01:46:33;01:46:37;"- Yeah, but sixer rhymes with more stuff, like river."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"- 12, no, but it ends with er."
01:46:39;01:46:41;"I mean, I also feel like truthfully,"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"if you're like into drinking,"
01:46:43;01:46:47;"we're talking 18 or 24 packs most of the time."
01:46:47;01:46:48;"- Yeah."
01:46:48;01:46:50;"- You might as well go for two 18s, a 36er."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"- That's if you're rolling with like a crew."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- Right."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"- But I'm saying if you're rolling with like two,"
01:46:55;01:46:58;"three, four people, you're bringing a 12."
01:46:58;01:47:00;"- The number three song right now"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"of the global streaming country, whatever."
01:47:03;01:47:05;"- Global streaming country."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"(laughing)"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"- Is Lee Bryce, ""One of Them Girls."""
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Hi, I'm Lee Bryce."
01:47:13;01:47:15;"- And I'm Travis Scott."
01:47:15;01:47:16;"This is our new song, ""One of Them Girls."""
01:47:19;01:47:25;"- Oh dude, this last paragraph of these notes is awesome."
01:47:25;01:47:27;"Lee, who's a father of three,"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"called an emergency songwriting session"
01:47:29;01:47:32;"with co-writers Ashley Gorley, Dallas Davidson,"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"and Ben Johnson at two o'clock in the morning"
01:47:35;01:47:37;"in order to bring the track to life."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"- Just like--"
01:47:38;01:47:39;"- What does that mean?"
01:47:39;01:47:42;"To like write it or to punch it up?"
01:47:42;01:47:43;"- Probably they're in the studio."
01:47:43;01:47:46;"Like dude, like you're working on like the new ""Vampire"""
01:47:46;01:47:48;"at two in the morning with Arielle."
01:47:48;01:47:49;"My phone starts going off."

01:47:55;01:47:57;"- I kinda missed the opening line."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"The opening line of the song is,"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"""Are you one of them girls"
01:47:59;01:48:02;"that peels off the Bud Light label?"""
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Without looking at the rest of the song,"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"if somebody was talking about like,"
01:48:05;01:48:08;"you know, the type of girl that peels off the Bud Light label,"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"what's the first thing that comes to mind?"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"What do you think that implies about a woman?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"- I don't know what that means."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"That is mystifying."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"- Anxiety, right?"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"- No. - Yeah."
01:48:19;01:48:20;"No, that's what I was thinking."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- You think that's what it means?"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"Like fidgeting?"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"- It's like a nervous twitch."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"I mean, I feel like I usually,"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"I'm like on a wet beer,"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"I'll usually like (beep) with the label."
01:48:29;01:48:30;"I don't peel it off and like,"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"I guess it also depends."
01:48:31;01:48:34;"I'll probably like little by little like,"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"you know, squish it."
01:48:35;01:48:38;"I guess I can picture like somebody"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"who peels it off like perfectly."
01:48:40;01:48:43;"And then I don't know what you do with it next."
01:48:43;01:48:45;"Make it as like a temporary sticker?"
01:48:45;01:48:46;"- Yeah."
01:48:46;01:48:49;"- Does that imply that she's like a cool ass girl?"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"'Cause are you one of those girls"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"that peels off the Bud Light label,"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"just might run a pool table?"

01:48:57;01:48:58;"Ain't you one of them girls I ask you to dance,"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"you say no?"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"It's like she's like a cool guy's girl."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"- Like a tomboy?"
01:49:05;01:49:06;"- Yeah, like a tomboy."
01:49:06;01:49:09;"- She wants you thinking that she's drinking a normal Bud"
01:49:09;01:49:12;"and that she's not like a lady"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"that cares about having a Bud Light."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"So she, that's why she can run you at the pool table."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"She's one of the guys."
01:49:18;01:49:20;"- She's drinking a Bud Heavy."
01:49:20;01:49:21;"- Yeah."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- Oh, that's deep."
01:49:22;01:49:24;"- Okay. Oh, interesting."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"- Although I gotta tell you,"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"'cause I'll pull the labels off of like a,"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"sort of a wet beer out of being nervous."
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I think that we're the only people"
01:49:33;01:49:36;"that would ever read being nervous."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"That's like a very Seinfeldian read to the whole thing."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"- Peels off the Bud Light label."
01:49:41;01:49:44;"- Yeah, like, oh, I'm at this like weird industry event"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"at the Chateau Marmont"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"and there's a famous director across the room"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"I wanna talk to."
01:49:50;01:49:53;"I'm nervously peeling the label off the beer."
01:49:53;01:49:54;"(laughing)"
01:49:54;01:49:58;"- To be fair, it is kind of nasty."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"- Yeah, could you imagine a country song"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"about one of those girls with neurosclerosis?"
01:50:01;01:50:02;"- It's not a good look if you meet somebody"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"for the first time of any gender"
01:50:05;01:50:06;"and they're holding a raggedy looking beer"
01:50:06;01:50:09;"that's got like nail marks in the thick."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"- Yeah."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"- Don't do it."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Now, this is a good reminder to myself, don't do it."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Or if you do it, get it fully peeled off."
01:50:14;01:50:17;"But even then there's gonna be like some of the white left."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"It's not a good look, don't do it."
01:50:18;01:50:22;"- I'm picturing Seinfeld meeting Julia Louis-Dreyfus"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"for the first time and he's nervously peeled"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"the label off his beer."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- I'm just shredding that label, yeah."
01:50:27;01:50:28;"- Right."
01:50:28;01:50:29;"And you're just like,"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"- Just look at your beer."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"- Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, I run an account perhaps,"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"you've heard of it called Seinfeld 2000."
01:50:34;01:50:37;"And she's like, it's just like total beep style."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"Her eyes are just like staring at your raggedy beer."
01:50:39;01:50:44;"And she's like, ""Uh, yeah, well, good luck with that."""
01:50:44;01:50:48;"- I've got like bits of like wet ripped label"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"all over my shirt."
01:50:49;01:50:50;"- Oh yeah."
01:50:50;01:50:50;"- 15, I'm still wiping."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"- It's all still dug into your nails."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"You go to shake her hand, she's like, ""Oh!"""
01:50:54;01:50:57;"(laughing)"
01:50:58;01:51:01;"- Little balls of the rolled up label."
01:51:01;01:51:04;"- Little balls of the rolled up label"
01:51:04;01:51:05;"just all over the table."
01:51:05;01:51:07;"(laughing)"
01:51:07;01:51:08;"- Yeah, it's kind of nasty."
01:51:08;01:51:11;"God, I'm thinking about, are there times in my life"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"I've totally made a bad impression by having a raggedy,"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"- But wait, just to be clear,"
01:51:15;01:51:19;"some labels I do feel are not,"
01:51:19;01:51:22;"they haven't been like adhesively stuck"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"to the bottle in such a way."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"- But you know that it's still your nails."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"You did it."
01:51:27;01:51:29;"You Wolverine that (beep)"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"(laughing)"
01:51:31;01:51:34;"It's a bad look."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"And especially if you're sitting at a bar"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"and you got that (beep) all over the table."
01:51:38;01:51:41;"God, my life is flashing before my eyes"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"and I'm thinking of times I just nervously did that."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"And I was probably sitting across from some upper crust type"
01:51:47;01:51:49;"sitting across the bar."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"I tried to look good."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"I tried to wear nice clothes."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"I tried to make elegant conversation"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"and it all went out the (beep) window"
01:51:57;01:52:01;"because I nervously just scratched all up on my beard"
01:52:01;01:52:05;"and made little disgusting pellets in a circle"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"at my end of the table."
01:52:07;01:52:08;"Oh my God."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"Humiliating."
01:52:11;01:52:15;"People don't do it."
01:52:15;01:52:18;"People learn from my mistakes."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Jake, do you do that?"
01:52:19;01:52:20;"- I've done it."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"I mean, it's not a regular go-to move, but we've all done it."
01:52:24;01:52:26;"- We've all been there."
01:52:26;01:52:30;"Shout out to Lee Bryce and one of them girls."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"I mean, he really like first line out"
01:52:32;01:52:35;"just tapped into like some deeper element"
01:52:35;01:52:37;"of the human condition."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"- Lee Bryce."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"- Damn."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"- You have my attention."
01:52:40;01:52:41;"You got us hooked."
01:52:41;01:52:46;"The number two song on the global country streamers"
01:52:46;01:52:49;"is Gabby Barrett with ""I Hope""."

01:54:04;01:54:06;"- Not really hearing the country, but that's cool, whatever."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"That could be like Meghan Trainor or something."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"- It's the Southern accent makes it country."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"- Yeah."
01:54:12;01:54:12;"- If it wasn't Southern accent,"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"it would just, you'd just call it pop music, I guess."
01:54:15;01:54:18;"But you know, I guess the subject matter, cheating."
01:54:18;01:54:21;"Obviously there's cheating in all genres."
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Country music does seem to have like a monopoly"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"on a certain type of cheating song,"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"but you know, it's a good point."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"I mean, this is something we've all heard this before."
01:54:29;01:54:33;"You know, you hear about somebody cheated on somebody"
01:54:33;01:54:34;"and you're, you know,"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"generally my feeling with that stuff is like,"
01:54:37;01:54:39;"that's painful, it's not a cool move,"
01:54:39;01:54:43;"but that's life and I hope everybody ends up better for it."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"Clearly the relationship, you know, whatever."
01:54:45;01:54:48;"I try not to be too, too judgmental,"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"but then these conversations come up where you,"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"'cause sometimes you hear, well,"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"that relationship began with people cheating on each other,"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"really not cool."
01:54:57;01:54:59;"They should have been more upfront,"
01:54:59;01:55:02;"but then they ended up being together, you know, for forever."
01:55:02;01:55:02;"- Sure."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"- But then, so there's always somebody"
01:55:05;01:55:06;"when you have those conversations who says,"
01:55:06;01:55:11;"yeah, but if somebody was willing to cheat with you"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"when you were in a relationship"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"and then you end up with them,"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"wouldn't you always be worried?"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Eventually the cycle would repeat?"
01:55:18;01:55:19;"- Sure."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- I don't know."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"I don't know what to make of it."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"I think sometimes people are in kind of"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"immature places in their life"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"and they don't know how to deal with stuff"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"and people cheat on each other"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"and maybe people do grow past it"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"and find the right relationship and it's a non-issue,"
01:55:33;01:55:36;"but maybe it is a cycle"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"and I think that's what Gabby Barrett's talking about"
01:55:38;01:55:42;"and she's actually hoping for it as revenge,"
01:55:42;01:55:45;"which I guess is kind of rude,"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"but you know, she's right to be hurt."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"This guy cheated on her."
01:55:48;01:55:52;"- I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- I dig it."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"- This one doesn't seem as like"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"less of a window into the--"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"- There's no like fun imagery or anything with it."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"It's just sort of like, I hope."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"Okay."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"- Right."
01:56:03;01:56:06;"- That's what you hope of all the things you hope for."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"You hope that you're--"
01:56:07;01:56:11;"- Angry, cheated on country woman"
01:56:11;01:56:15;"is like a classic type of song."
01:56:15;01:56:16;"What was that like,"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"was it like early Carrie Underwood song"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"that was like about like (beep) up the guy's car?"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"- I don't know."
01:56:21;01:56:23;"- That might be a whole sub genre of country music"
01:56:23;01:56:25;"that's like, some guy cheats on you,"
01:56:25;01:56:26;"you (beep) up their car."
01:56:26;01:56:28;"- And Loretta Lynn's Other Woman."
01:56:28;01:56:31;"I mean, Loretta Lynn's, most of her career is,"
01:56:31;01:56:32;"a lot of her songs are about it,"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"but the Other Woman is, you know,"
01:56:34;01:56:37;"it's a big part of the genre."
01:56:37;01:56:39;"- I mean, it's funny when you consider that."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Yeah, what am I thinking of?"
01:56:40;01:56:44;"- Oh, the song Before He Cheats from 2005."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"There's a quote from her saying,"
01:56:47;01:56:50;"she's thinking about him being at some bar with some girl"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"and she gets really angry and goes outside"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"and destroys his mode of transportation."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"- Mode of transportation?"
01:56:57;01:56:58;"Is that what the lyrics are?"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"- No, no, that's a quote."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"That's a quote."
01:57:01;01:57:06;"♪ I'm gonna destroy your mode of transportation ♪"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"Oh yeah, yeah."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"I dug my key into the side"
01:57:08;01:57:11;"of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive,"
01:57:11;01:57:12;"carved my name into his leather seats."
01:57:12;01:57:15;"I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,"
01:57:15;01:57:16;"slashed a hole in all four tires."
01:57:16;01:57:19;"Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats."
01:57:19;01:57:22;"I mean, this is just like a way richer song"
01:57:22;01:57:24;"in terms of imagery."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"- Do you see what happens, Larry?"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"- You see what happens?"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"Right now he's probably slow dancing"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"with a bleached blonde tramp."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"Woo, that's not very woke, Carrie."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"And she's probably getting frisky right now."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"He's probably buying her some fruity little drink"
01:57:37;01:57:39;"'cause she can't shoot whiskey."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"This is kind of like a combination of the Lee Bryce"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"and the Gabby Barrett songs."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"She's being like, I'm a real woman who drinks whiskey"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"and you're buying fruity little drinks"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"for that (beep) loser."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"- Like a doogarita."
01:57:51;01:57:55;"- She probably drinks doogaritas."
01:57:55;01:57:57;"Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"showing her how to shoot a combo and he don't know."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"What literally, these are the same,"
01:58:01;01:58:02;"this is like a checklist of the things"
01:58:02;01:58:04;"that Lee Bryce likes about this other girl"
01:58:04;01:58:06;"'cause she's like a real bar girl."
01:58:06;01:58:09;"She drinks for real and she plays pool."
01:58:09;01:58:11;"And she's talking about some loser drinks fruity drinks"
01:58:11;01:58:12;"can't play pool."
01:58:12;01:58:15;"It's also funny, I think that's also why,"
01:58:15;01:58:18;"I mean, I've said many times that I think"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"I Will Always Love You by Dolly Parton"
01:58:21;01:58:24;"is one of the most beautiful, well-written songs"
01:58:24;01:58:26;"in the American songbook."
01:58:26;01:58:29;"And famously, I think, I might have this kind of wrong,"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"I think in the same day or the same hour,"
01:58:31;01:58:33;"she wrote that and Jolene."
01:58:33;01:58:35;"You know, just one of these magic moments."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"You sit down and just bang some (beep) out."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"And it's funny because what's interesting"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"about both those songs is that,"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"and I've said about this at length"
01:58:43;01:58:44;"about I Will Always Love You,"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"but it's this unusual sentiment"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"where it's kind of like understanding"
01:58:49;01:58:54;"that life is painful, people fall in and out of love,"
01:58:54;01:58:57;"that beautiful relationships end,"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"that you carry pain and love in your heart"
01:58:59;01:59:02;"for people who you don't have in your life"
01:59:02;01:59:03;"in the case of I Will Always Love You."
01:59:03;01:59:06;"And Jolene is also like a kind of nuanced version"
01:59:06;01:59:09;"of understanding that it's not all about"
01:59:09;01:59:12;"I love this person, I (beep) hate that person from my past."
01:59:12;01:59:16;"Jolene is literally saying to Jolene,"
01:59:16;01:59:18;"rather than being like, Jolene,"
01:59:18;01:59:20;"you don't know how to shoot pool,"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"you (beep) suck, and I'm going to beat the (beep)"
01:59:22;01:59:24;"out of my boyfriend 'cause he even thought"
01:59:24;01:59:25;"about cheating on me with you,"
01:59:25;01:59:26;"it's literally saying to Jolene,"
01:59:26;01:59:30;"I recognize that you're an amazing woman."
01:59:30;01:59:32;"And realistically, it's probably very difficult"
01:59:32;01:59:34;"for my man to stay away from you."
01:59:34;01:59:36;"You're very appealing."
01:59:36;01:59:38;"I'm just pleading with you."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"Don't use your powers for evil."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"Stay away, please."
01:59:41;01:59:43;"You're really gonna ruin my life here."
01:59:43;01:59:48;"- I always wondered if the guy ended up going with Jolene"
01:59:48;01:59:51;"after the song's over, 'cause you just don't know."
01:59:51;01:59:53;"- She lets the listener sit in that ambiguity."
01:59:53;01:59:55;"- Just like, what happened?"
01:59:55;01:59:56;"Did he go with Jolene or not?"
01:59:56;01:59:58;"- Yeah, it's really haunting."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"I feel like that song fades out with just,"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"♪ Jolene ♪"
02:00:02;02:00:05;"Just like, just wailing her name into the night."
02:00:05;02:00:09;"Maybe Jolene said, Dolly, listen,"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"I will not take your man just because I can."
02:00:11;02:00:14;"You will not find me going down to the pool hall"
02:00:14;02:00:16;"and flirting with him."
02:00:16;02:00:20;"However, if he starts coming over here, that's on him."
02:00:20;02:00:23;"And maybe Jolene did say, all right, girl code,"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"I won't go steal your man."
02:00:25;02:00:28;"But if your man comes looking for me, what can I do?"
02:00:28;02:00:30;"- I'm putting you on notice, Jolene."
02:00:30;02:00:31;"I am interested."
02:00:31;02:00:35;"But I will not initiate."
02:00:35;02:00:35;"- Sure."
02:00:35;02:00:38;"Maybe she wrote those songs back to back"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"because they're about the same two things."
02:00:40;02:00:44;"It's like, last ditch ever, Jolene,"
02:00:44;02:00:45;"please don't take my man."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"Let me level with you."
02:00:46;02:00:49;"This (beep) is gonna (beep) destroy me."
02:00:49;02:00:51;"And then Jolene's like, oh, all right."
02:00:51;02:00:54;"No promises, but I'm not gonna go out of my way"
02:00:54;02:00:54;"to steal him."
02:00:54;02:00:59;"And then a couple days later, she did in fact steal him."
02:00:59;02:01:03;"And Dolly's like, oh (beep), well, I tried and I failed,"
02:01:03;02:01:04;"but I will always love you."
02:01:04;02:01:08;"The number one song on the global country"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"doogarita charts right now,"
02:01:10;02:01:12;"Jason Aldean, ""Got What I Got."""
02:01:12;02:01:15;"(soft music)"
02:01:15;02:01:22;"He wanted to have a little vinyl dirtiness on this song,"
02:01:22;02:01:23;"a retro sound."
02:01:23;02:01:28;"♪ She said, baby, do you ever miss being alone? ♪"
02:01:28;02:01:32;"♪ I said, hell no, I don't ♪"
02:01:32;02:01:37;"♪ She said, do you really think I'm where you belong? ♪"
02:01:37;02:01:41;"♪ I said, you know and I know you're perfect for me ♪"

02:01:43;02:01:48;"♪ I ain't playing what I'm saying ♪"
02:01:48;02:01:53;"♪ When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had ♪"

02:02:04;02:02:08;"♪ But when I got what I got, girl, I don't ♪"
02:02:08;02:02:09;"- Very convoluted."
02:02:09;02:02:10;"- Yeah, this is very convoluted."
02:02:10;02:02:14;"I mean, Jason Aldean, he's got some bangers,"
02:02:14;02:02:18;"but this one is like, I can't tell honestly,"
02:02:18;02:02:18;"- I think-"
02:02:18;02:02:21;"- If the guy in this song is being honest or not."
02:02:21;02:02:23;"I can't even tell what the intention is."
02:02:23;02:02:25;"- Well, I think he's, 'cause yeah,"
02:02:25;02:02:28;"""I Got What I Got"" is an expression of like resignation,"
02:02:28;02:02:31;"just sort of like, well, that's how it is,"
02:02:31;02:02:32;"I got what I got."
02:02:32;02:02:35;"I think it's his awkward way of saying to his lady friend"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"that he's actually really psyched in the situation."
02:02:37;02:02:42;"He's not harping on the past and like romanticizing the past."
02:02:42;02:02:44;"I mean, he's excited about her, but-"
02:02:44;02:02:46;"- That's not how it feels."
02:02:46;02:02:49;"I mean, it's an overused term,"
02:02:49;02:02:51;"but I think this is actually a very straightforward example"
02:02:51;02:02:53;"of gaslighting."
02:02:53;02:02:53;"(laughs)"
02:02:53;02:02:55;"We gotta get the Dixie Chicks on."
02:02:55;02:02:58;"They have a song called ""Gaslighter"" to talk about this."
02:02:58;02:02:59;"- Ezra's the chicks."
02:02:59;02:03:00;"- Oh, oops."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"Now they're just called the chicks."
02:03:02;02:03:04;"- Early '80s LA punk band, the chicks."
02:03:04;02:03:05;"(laughs)"
02:03:05;02:03:06;"- Yeah."
02:03:06;02:03:10;"'Cause the second verse says, ""I said, baby,"
02:03:10;02:03:11;"""do you know you sound a little crazy"
02:03:11;02:03:13;"""when you're talking like that girl?"""
02:03:13;02:03:14;"That is classic gaslighting."
02:03:14;02:03:18;"It's just to be like, you sound (beep) crazy right now."
02:03:18;02:03:21;"But I think probably all the listeners picked up on this,"
02:03:21;02:03:26;"but just to summarize, this song starts with his lady saying"
02:03:26;02:03:28;"""Baby, do you ever miss being alone?"""
02:03:28;02:03:30;"And I said, ""Hell no, I don't."""
02:03:30;02:03:33;"Which already seems overly emphatic."
02:03:33;02:03:34;"- Yeah, defensive, yeah."
02:03:34;02:03:36;"- And then she said, ""Do you really think"
02:03:36;02:03:37;"""I'm where you belong?"""
02:03:37;02:03:39;"I said, ""You know and I know, you're perfect for me."
02:03:39;02:03:41;"""Everything I'll ever need."""
02:03:41;02:03:42;"I ain't playing, all right,"
02:03:42;02:03:44;"that's a pretty nice thing to say."
02:03:44;02:03:47;"But then when the chorus is, and the title of the song is,"
02:03:47;02:03:49;"""I got what I got,"" that kinda reminds me of"
02:03:49;02:03:52;"if you were with somebody and they said,"
02:03:52;02:03:55;"""Do you ever miss your ex-girlfriend?"""
02:03:55;02:03:57;"And you just said, ""It's water under the bridge."""
02:03:57;02:04:01;"And they're like, ""Wait, so that's a no?"
02:04:01;02:04:02;"""It's water under the bridge?"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"""So you're saying you never think about them"
02:04:04;02:04:06;"""and you're happy to be with me?"""
02:04:06;02:04:08;"- Past is the past."
02:04:08;02:04:09;"- The past is the past?"
02:04:09;02:04:11;"I'm with you now, I got what I got."
02:04:11;02:04:14;"And what I don't got, I don't got."
02:04:14;02:04:17;"Okay, you're really not making me feel better about this"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"right now, it's water under the bridge."
02:04:19;02:04:21;"I got what I got."
02:04:21;02:04:22;"And she's like, ""Okay."""
02:04:23;02:04:25;"You sound (beep) crazy right now."
02:04:25;02:04:26;"I'm gonna go down to the floating dock and get (beep)"
02:04:26;02:04:29;"'cause you sound (beep) crazy right now."
02:04:29;02:04:31;"When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had."
02:04:31;02:04:34;"It's also some Dr. Seuss (beep)"
02:04:34;02:04:37;"just trying to razzle dazzle somebody with language."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"When I got what I got, I don't got what I don't got."
02:04:39;02:04:42;"How could I miss what I don't got when I have what I had?"
02:04:42;02:04:45;"Because if I had what I had, I wouldn't got what I got."
02:04:45;02:04:47;"- It's like a Joe Pesci character"
02:04:47;02:04:49;"in a Scorsese movie."
02:04:49;02:04:50;"- Right."
02:04:50;02:04:51;"- I got what I got."
02:04:52;02:04:54;"- Yeah, it's like, yeah, yeah."
02:04:54;02:04:55;"- I don't miss what I haven't had."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"- The radio is like, yeah, no, no, I understand that."
02:04:58;02:05:01;"But I'm saying, do you ever think,"
02:05:01;02:05:04;"listen you (beep) idiot, I said I got what I got."
02:05:04;02:05:06;"No, no, I know you got what you got."
02:05:06;02:05:08;"Listen to this (beep) guy."
02:05:08;02:05:09;"Starts pushing him around."
02:05:09;02:05:10;"Hey, no, no, I didn't mean anything by it."
02:05:10;02:05:12;"I got what I got."
02:05:12;02:05:14;"How could I miss what I had if I got what I got?"
02:05:14;02:05:15;"No, no, I don't miss."
02:05:15;02:05:16;"(laughing)"
02:05:16;02:05:19;"And then he's like, it's water under the goddam bridge."
02:05:19;02:05:22;"It's water under the goddam bridge."
02:05:22;02:05:25;"Well, that was a fun top five."
02:05:25;02:05:28;"I think Morgan Wallen, Seven Summers,"
02:05:28;02:05:31;"and Lee Bryce, one of them girls, tied for first."
02:05:31;02:05:33;"So maybe those should be on our list"
02:05:33;02:05:36;"for the pitching worst margarita of my life."
02:05:36;02:05:38;"- I think that's a great idea."
02:05:38;02:05:41;"- Well, another time crisis in the past."
02:05:41;02:05:42;"We got what we got."
02:05:42;02:05:44;"We had what we had."
02:05:44;02:05:46;"Water under the bridge."
02:05:46;02:05:48;"This time crisis is done."
02:05:48;02:05:49;"We got what we got."
02:05:49;02:05:50;"It's over."
02:05:50;02:05:52;"All right, see you guys in two weeks."
02:05:52;02:05:53;"Peace."
02:05:53;02:05:56;"- [Narrator] Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
02:05:56;02:05:58;"(laughs)"
