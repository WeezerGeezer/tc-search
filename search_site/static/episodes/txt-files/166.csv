00:00;00:09;"Goldfish, Jennifer Lopez, and of course Johnny Marr. In this episode we talked to"
00:09;00:13;"one of the greatest guitarists of all time, chow down on some new and exciting"
00:13;00:21;"snacks, talk about Jake's birthday, and listen to lots of great music. This is a"
00:21;00:29;"very special Big & Crispy Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:37;00:40;"All of those great romances"
00:40;00:43;"They were a planned Robin Hood"
00:43;00:47;"On my ride for chances"
00:47;00:50;"My picture clear"
00:50;00:54;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:54;00:58;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:58;01:01;"One of us had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:09;"One of us is crying"
01:09;01:12;"One of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"We were only there"
01:16;01:18;"Hello, welcome to Time Crisis."
01:18;01:21;"I had a little bit of a mic crisis at the beginning of the show"
01:21;01:27;"so you might notice that the audio quality sounds a little bit phone-y."
01:27;01:29;"But stick with it, it doesn't last that long."
01:29;01:31;"We get back on track real soon."
01:31;01:32;"Check it out."
01:32;01:36;"I'm not going to front, we're recording this one on Jake's actual birthday."
01:36;01:38;"So happy birthday, Jake."
01:38;01:40;"Thank you, good friend."
01:40;01:42;"This is the big four five."
01:42;01:44;"Big four five?"
01:44;01:46;"I started doing the show when I was 38."
01:46;01:48;"What?"
01:48;01:50;"Wait, we've been doing the show for seven years?"
01:50;01:52;"Yeah, the show started in 15."
01:52;01:53;"Whoa."
01:53;01:54;"I was 38."
01:54;01:56;"I'm almost 38."
01:56;01:57;"Dude, yeah."
01:57;01:58;"Years between."
01:58;02:00;"We've almost completed a full years between run."
02:00;02:03;"Alright, well, that's quite an achievement."
02:03;02:05;"We covered the years between."
02:05;02:07;"Going to move on to our next show."
02:07;02:12;"Time Crisis was a show about being 38."
02:12;02:15;"It started when one co-host was 38"
02:15;02:17;"and then ended when the other co-host turned 38."
02:17;02:19;"I think it's a great way to end the show."
02:19;02:21;"Experiment conducted by Harvard University."
02:21;02:24;"We still got some gas in the tank, though."
02:24;02:26;"So how do you feel about 45?"
02:26;02:28;"Maybe there's something to the psychology of"
02:28;02:30;"ages that end in five."
02:30;02:32;"They seem significant."
02:32;02:34;"I remember 35 was like,"
02:34;02:36;"Whoa."
02:36;02:38;"35 is like unambiguously like"
02:38;02:40;"grown-ass man age."
02:40;02:41;"Yeah."
02:41;02:42;"You're mid-decade."
02:42;02:43;"Right."
02:43;02:44;"Like my 40s are half over."
02:44;02:45;"That's wild."
02:45;02:47;"How messed up is that?"
02:47;02:49;"Well, you're really looking down at 50,"
02:49;02:52;"which is a classic age."
02:52;02:54;"I mean, let's face it, they're all classic from here on out."
02:54;02:58;"I mean, 44 and 46 are like,"
02:58;03:00;"Okay, yeah, mid-40s."
03:00;03:02;"But 45 is just like,"
03:02;03:03;"I don't know, man."
03:03;03:04;"Those fives hit hard."
03:04;03:06;"45 years old."
03:06;03:08;"I'm 45."
03:08;03:14;"Yeah, that's pretty unambiguously grown-up age."
03:14;03:17;"I mean, especially because I think..."
03:17;03:20;"60 is like unambiguously grown-up age."
03:20;03:22;"No, I think it really is like that,"
03:22;03:25;"especially in our kind of like culture"
03:25;03:29;"where all the classic markers of previous generations,"
03:29;03:31;"adulthood, like..."
03:31;03:33;"They keep getting pushed back."
03:33;03:34;"Yeah, keep getting pushed back"
03:34;03:36;"because, you know, whatever, back in the day,"
03:36;03:38;"they ship you off to war."
03:38;03:40;"You might not even be 18."
03:40;03:41;"Back in the day,"
03:41;03:44;"they were definitely shipping like 16, 17-year-olds off to war."
03:44;03:46;"It's like you come back from that,"
03:46;03:48;"you're like, Yep, everything changed."
03:48;03:50;"I remember before they shipped me off and,"
03:50;03:53;"yeah, not a kid anymore."
03:53;03:54;"Get a job."
03:54;03:57;"You're like 24, homeowner, married, two kids."
03:57;03:59;"Veteran."
03:59;04:01;"So, you know, whatever."
04:01;04:04;"I'm not saying that makes you an adult,"
04:04;04:08;"but it definitely changes the fabric of your life."
04:08;04:09;"Let's put it that way."
04:09;04:10;"And then, you know,"
04:10;04:12;"especially now in this like weird culture"
04:12;04:16;"where even the content people consume,"
04:16;04:18;"it might be the same throughout their whole life"
04:18;04:21;"or there's more leisure time to kind of like"
04:21;04:24;"maintain your interest in comic books"
04:24;04:26;"or the MCU, music, whatever."
04:26;04:29;"I think that used to be some kind of like cut-off **** too."
04:29;04:32;"Just like, Oh, yeah, I used to go see the pictures."
04:32;04:33;"Then I got shipped off, came back,"
04:33;04:36;"I haven't seen a movie in five years."
04:36;04:39;"Whereas today, you know, there are people,"
04:39;04:40;"there's a lot more fluidity."
04:40;04:43;"But yeah, I know so many people who say like,"
04:43;04:44;"Oh, yeah, no, you're 30."
04:44;04:46;"30s are the new 20s."
04:46;04:48;"Or, you know, when you're 20,"
04:48;04:49;"you can't enjoy yourself in the same way"
04:49;04:50;"when you're in your 30s."
04:50;04:52;"So then when people kind of shift 30s"
04:52;04:54;"into being like a 20s type time"
04:54;04:57;"for having more fun and exploring, whatever,"
04:57;05:03;"then the 40s become the first unambiguously adult decade."
05:03;05:05;"I totally could see, maybe not on this show,"
05:05;05:07;"but I could see on some podcasts,"
05:07;05:08;"somebody just being like,"
05:08;05:09;"Bro, you're turning 60 next year."
05:09;05:11;"And it's like, yeah, dude,"
05:11;05:13;"I'm officially not a kid anymore."
05:15;05:17;"Or maybe it's going to be like retirement age,"
05:17;05:19;"whatever retirement age is going to be,"
05:19;05:20;"it's going to be like 75."
05:20;05:21;"When we're that age,"
05:21;05:23;"I think that there might be people just be like,"
05:23;05:27;"when I officially started receiving like social security,"
05:27;05:29;"that's when I knew like,"
05:29;05:32;"childhood was like officially over then."
05:32;05:34;"I mean, don't, you know, don't get me wrong."
05:34;05:36;"I'm still into all the same, but just like,"
05:36;05:37;"yeah, I look in the mirror."
05:37;05:39;"When I look in the mirror, yeah,"
05:39;05:41;"I still feel like this young dude."
05:41;05:42;"But when I look in the mirror"
05:42;05:44;"and I see an 87 year old man,"
05:44;05:46;"I'm like, all right, you know what?"
05:46;05:49;"I do have some more like adult responsibilities now."
05:49;05:51;"You know, I got to take my blood pressure medication."
05:51;05:52;"First thing."
05:52;05:54;"Yep."
05:54;05:58;"I wonder how many 60 year olds are have podcasts."
05:58;06:02;"So a lot of people in their twenties, thirties, forties,"
06:02;06:06;"and a lot of the original crew, the, the, you know,"
06:06;06:08;"the Marin's the Rogans, et cetera,"
06:08;06:10;"were probably in their thirties or forties"
06:10;06:11;"when they started it."
06:11;06:13;"Now they're in their fifties,"
06:13;06:15;"but I wonder if it was just like,"
06:15;06:18;"there's gotta be dudes in their sixties that have podcasts."
06:18;06:20;"And I'm sure the number grows every day."
06:20;06:21;"Yeah."
06:21;06:23;"Sure. Thousands, tens of thousands."
06:23;06:26;"And definitely you're going to get the phenomenon that"
06:26;06:29;"because podcasting or, you know,"
06:29;06:31;"whatever the next version of it is,"
06:31;06:35;"some type of streaming based interactive media"
06:35;06:38;"will become this way that people communicate."
06:38;06:41;"I definitely could foresee an era where you're like"
06:41;06:43;"in a nursing home in the future."
06:43;06:47;"You can just find this like group of like really old people"
06:47;06:49;"sitting in circles with microphones."
06:49;06:50;"It's not plugged in."
06:50;06:51;"Oh my God."
06:51;06:53;"Wet hot American summer style,"
06:53;06:56;"just like the dangling and just like the people coming in,"
06:56;06:58;"just be like, all right guys, how's it going?"
06:58;06:59;"And they're just kind of sitting there like,"
06:59;07:00;"oh, we're having a really,"
07:00;07:02;"we're having a really good pod today."
07:02;07:03;"And it's like, what are you,"
07:03;07:04;"what are you guys talking about?"
07:04;07:05;"And they're just like,"
07:05;07:07;"we're talking about the second Thor movie and be like,"
07:07;07:08;"that's great guys."
07:08;07:09;"Okay."
07:09;07:12;"Press the button if anybody needs help,"
07:12;07:13;"you know, whatever."
07:13;07:16;"It's just like the playing Canasta."
07:16;07:18;"You're going to upload this pod later, right?"
07:18;07:20;"Like asking the nurse."
07:20;07:21;"Oh yeah."
07:21;07:22;"I'll get right on that."
07:22;07:25;"How many downloads of that last episode get?"
07:25;07:28;"Oh, it's Mr."
07:28;07:29;"Longstreet."
07:29;07:30;"That's doing very well."
07:30;07:32;"Oh, it's doing numbers."
07:32;07:33;"Mr."
07:33;07:34;"Longstreet."
07:34;07:35;"That's what I like to hear."
07:35;07:36;"Okay."
07:36;07:41;"The, the fake podcasting set up."
07:41;07:42;"Why not?"
07:42;07:43;"If it makes you happy,"
07:43;07:45;"can't be that bad."
07:45;07:46;"That's right."
07:46;07:48;"Cheryl Crow said it best."
07:49;07:50;"I've been alone."
07:50;07:51;"Long way from here."
07:51;07:52;"Play for mosquitoes."
07:52;07:53;"Drink till I was thirsty."
07:53;07:54;"We were searching."
07:54;07:55;"Through thrift store."
07:55;07:56;"Jungle."
07:56;08:24;"Marilyn."
08:24;08:50;"I made."
08:50;08:58;"We got you a whiskey glass."
08:58;09:00;"I just wanted to talk about it."
09:00;09:02;"Cause it was kind of interesting learning about the world of novelty."
09:02;09:03;"Whiskey glasses."
09:03;09:07;"Well, yeah, of course interject that we had a really nice TC birthday"
09:07;09:09;"dinner at your house last night."
09:09;09:12;"So I felt Nick came through with the best burritos in LA."
09:12;09:14;"They were very good."
09:14;09:15;"Yeah."
09:15;09:16;"I think Nick said it's called burritos."
09:16;09:17;"Las Pamas."
09:17;09:18;"Yeah."
09:18;09:19;"Shout out to that."
09:19;09:21;"So, you know, Jake likes."
09:21;09:22;"Whiskey."
09:22;09:25;"And so we started looking up whiskey glasses and we've talked on the show"
09:25;09:30;"about like novelty shirts and getting Jake increasingly aggressive."
09:30;09:35;"Not with shirts to wear such as his famous breaking news."
09:35;09:36;"I don't care."
09:36;09:37;"Sure."
09:37;09:38;"Was it?"
09:38;09:39;"I don't give a or I don't care."
09:39;09:41;"I think it's actually, I don't care."
09:41;09:42;"It would be so much better if it was breaking news."
09:42;09:43;"I don't give a."
09:43;09:44;"Yeah."
09:44;09:45;"Which especially in these troubled times,"
09:45;09:47;"I'm sure it's a very useful shirt to have,"
09:47;09:51;"but we wanted to get you a whiskey glass and we started looking up funny"
09:51;09:52;"whiskey glasses."
09:52;09:56;"And of course, like with anything, there's these like cheap, dumb,"
09:56;09:59;"a million versions of anything you could think of."
09:59;10:02;"So just like with t-shirts, you could find all these bizarre Facebook shirts."
10:02;10:05;"There's the same thing for whiskey glasses."
10:05;10:08;"And we narrowed it down to a few."
10:08;10:09;"Some of them were very,"
10:09;10:14;"were a little too disturbing and were vetoed by Seinfeld."
10:14;10:19;"The one that I thought you might appreciate was a whiskey glass that said"
10:19;10:22;"daddy's sippy cup. And I said, well, this is perfect."
10:22;10:24;"Jake has a baby."
10:24;10:28;"So this is like made for a dad with a young child, because of course,"
10:28;10:30;"a baby would have a sippy cup."
10:30;10:34;"And then you have this whiskey glass and says daddy's sippy cup and the"
10:34;10:36;"whole family can laugh about it."
10:36;10:38;"You could put it next to your daughter's sippy cup."
10:38;10:42;"Seinfeld thought it was creepy. What's your take, Jake?"
10:42;10:44;"I'm glad you didn't get me that one."
10:44;10:49;"I'm not a fan of the phrase daddy, self-applying daddy."
10:49;10:51;"Right. If your kid calls you daddy, that's okay."
10:51;10:52;"That's fine. I mean,"
10:52;10:55;"I want her to eventually transition to just straight up dad."
10:55;10:58;"I don't want like a nine-year-old calling me daddy."
10:58;11:02;"Not a fan. Dad."
11:02;11:03;"Okay."
11:03;11:06;"And so definitely I'm not into self-applying daddy."
11:06;11:09;"And I guess dad's sippy cup wouldn't seem quite right."
11:09;11:12;"It's so fun. I remember last night,"
11:12;11:16;"your son wandered in for a second and I was like cracking a brew and I could"
11:16;11:19;"see him eyeing the brew and you're like, that's a big boy drink."
11:19;11:26;"I mean, it is."
11:26;11:29;"It's a big boy drink. Can of Modelo."
11:29;11:33;"It gets confusing with the kids because when they get to be like,"
11:33;11:36;"you know, two or three, you do start talking about, well, you know,"
11:36;11:40;"you're a big boy now because it's important to them to differentiate between"
11:40;11:43;"when they were babies, you know, like little kids,"
11:43;11:47;"they become very interested in, in those years. You'll, you'll see about like,"
11:47;11:50;"wait, so when I was a baby, I didn't do this. I didn't do that."
11:50;11:53;"Or they'll meet a baby and be like, Oh, the baby can't,"
11:53;11:56;"they don't have teeth yet. Well, they don't walk yet. And like, yeah,"
11:56;11:58;"that was you. That was you not that long ago. Oh, I didn't."
11:58;12:00;"They're like, yeah, well now you're a big boy."
12:00;12:04;"But then of course you also sometimes use big boy to refer to like grownup"
12:04;12:06;"stuff. So big boy has this very,"
12:06;12:09;"this very ambiguous phrase where I think he understood what I meant."
12:09;12:12;"Cause if he presses him, if he said, but dad, I'm a big boy,"
12:12;12:15;"I sleep in a big boy bed. I'd be like, okay, I got to revise that."
12:15;12:19;"Beer is not a big boy drink. Beer is an adult beverage."
12:19;12:23;"Adult beverage. He's, I mean, he definitely, you know,"
12:23;12:26;"he was like copy that. He seemed to understand it immediately. Yeah."
12:26;12:28;"There's multiple levels of big boys."
12:28;12:31;"Yeah. It's one of those things where in the English language,"
12:31;12:35;"big boy has many meanings and you know, as a native English speaker,"
12:35;12:39;"you just get it. Even at three years old context clues, I'm a big boy."
12:39;12:43;"You're a big boy. We're not the same. Both big boys. So yeah,"
12:43;12:45;"I'm glad you guys didn't get me daddy sippy cup."
12:45;12:48;"I'm glad you didn't get me the F Biden one."
12:48;12:52;"Although that would have been pretty straight up F Biden."
12:52;12:59;"We got into the political ones and there was just F Biden,"
12:59;13:03;"just to kind of like disturb your guests. Yeah."
13:03;13:06;"Just picturing Jake being like, Hey, you want a whiskey?"
13:06;13:10;"Filling out the F Biden whiskey and probably like most people,"
13:10;13:13;"you know, it'd be like, I'm going to leave. I'm not comfortable with that."
13:13;13:15;"But then on the other side of the spectrum,"
13:15;13:19;"Seinfeld was voting for one that said Kamala Harris is my hero."
13:19;13:22;"That I don't understand. Why is that on a whiskey glass?"
13:22;13:26;"Like, is that, is that ironic? Like, oh man, Kamala Harris is my hero."
13:26;13:29;"That's pathetic. I'm going to get drunk. No, no, no."
13:29;13:33;"It's just like, I mean, at that point you could just put anyone on there."
13:33;13:36;"Just like, I mean, we're living in the mass produced cheap niche,"
13:36;13:40;"junky age, although the whiskey glass wasn't that junky when it came."
13:40;13:43;"But I mean, maybe this is my bias,"
13:43;13:45;"but when I think picture a whiskey drinker,"
13:45;13:49;"I'm picturing that they're going to be selling a lot more F Biden whiskey"
13:49;13:51;"glasses than Kamala Harris is my hero,"
13:51;13:53;"but maybe that's totally incorrect in 2022."
13:53;13:58;"And for all we know, there's hundreds of thousands of people who sip in a"
13:58;14:03;"fine scotch nightly with a Kamala Harris is my hero whiskey glass."
14:03;14:04;"The K-Hive."
14:04;14:07;"Why would the K-Hive not like whiskey? I don't know."
14:07;14:09;"Yeah, maybe we should have bought you both."
14:09;14:12;"Be like, hey Jake, however you're feeling on that given day,"
14:12;14:15;"either bust out the F Biden or the Kamala Harris is my hero."
14:15;14:18;"You'd be like, uh, thanks. I don't want either."
14:18;14:23;"There's this really dark school of whiskey glass that was seemed to be about"
14:23;14:28;"like alcoholism. And I found one that said in big font,"
14:28;14:31;"shut up liver, you'll be fine."
14:31;14:34;"Weird thing to put on a whiskey glass,"
14:34;14:37;"but that was like one of the first ones that came up."
14:37;14:39;"Shut up liver, you'll be fine."
14:39;14:44;"Yeah. That one's just sort of like, Oh, not that funny."
14:44;14:45;"Yeah. Too dark."
14:45;14:49;"That's just basically like, yes, I'm abusing myself and I'm proud of it."
14:49;14:51;"Yep. Cirrhosis."
14:51;14:53;"So what'd you decide on?"
14:53;14:57;"So in the end, the one that felt right and felt like the,"
14:57;15:02;"that you'd appreciate it's a kind of a complicated one with three lines."
15:02;15:03;"It's kind of interesting."
15:03;15:04;"It's kind of a,"
15:04;15:09;"an interactive one because each line would denote how much whiskey's in the"
15:09;15:11;"cup. So at the very top,"
15:11;15:13;"implying that you have a full glass of whiskey,"
15:13;15:17;"you haven't started to consume your whiskey yet in a spooky font."
15:17;15:19;"Anybody who sees this cup,"
15:19;15:23;"it's a very familiar spooky font that's often used in Halloween"
15:23;15:27;"decorations and things like that. In a spooky font, it says,"
15:27;15:32;"don't even ask. So meaning you haven't started your whiskey beverage yet."
15:32;15:36;"So don't even ask. You're not ready to interact with somebody."
15:36;15:39;"And then below that it says bad day."
15:39;15:42;"So you've gone from don't even ask to bad day."
15:42;15:44;"Maybe you've had a few sips of whiskey."
15:44;15:47;"And then finally, when you've consumed most of the whiskey beverage,"
15:47;15:49;"the line says good day."
15:49;15:51;"I interpreted this totally differently."
15:51;15:52;"Really?"
15:52;15:54;"I interpreted it in the reverse way,"
15:54;15:56;"which is when you're filling the whiskey glass,"
15:56;15:59;"if it's been a good day, you don't need that much."
15:59;16:02;"So you just fill it up to good day. That's the lowest line."
16:02;16:07;"If it's been a bad day, fill it up a little bit more to I've had a bad day."
16:07;16:09;"I need a drink. And then if you've had a really bad day,"
16:09;16:13;"you fill it all the way up to the don't even ask."
16:13;16:15;"Honey, how was your day? Don't even ask."
16:15;16:17;"Fill up the whiskey to that line."
16:17;16:19;"Okay. You know what you're saying makes more sense."
16:19;16:24;"I guess my interpretation is based on a school of coffee related products,"
16:24;16:28;"like coffee cups that because, you know,"
16:28;16:30;"there's the famously don't talk to me until I've had my coffee."
16:30;16:31;"It's a classic."
16:31;16:32;"And that's the morning version."
16:32;16:36;"And then there's probably a certain type of person who is not necessarily an"
16:36;16:40;"alcoholic, but maybe just a stressed out person who likes to unwind with a"
16:40;16:45;"whiskey who at the end of the day would have the same feeling of don't talk to"
16:45;16:47;"me until I've consumed this whole whiskey."
16:47;16:49;"So on the coffee cups that I'm talking about,"
16:49;16:52;"the idea is that you fill the coffee cup to the top and then it says like,"
16:52;16:57;"don't even talk to me, whatever. And then as it goes down, now you may speak."
16:57;16:59;"All right, let's have some fun, whatever."
16:59;17:03;"You know, as you consume the coffee, you're more and more ready."
17:03;17:05;"It's kind of just a breakdown of the phrase."
17:05;17:07;"Don't even talk to me until I've had my coffee."
17:07;17:12;"I just thought of this is the type of thing that's very probably unfunny to"
17:12;17:13;"most people."
17:13;17:17;"It would be funny to do a mashup of the coffee cups that have these gradations"
17:17;17:22;"of like how ready you are to talk to somebody. Don't even look at me."
17:22;17:27;"You may enter the room almost there. Now you may speak, let's talk, whatever."
17:27;17:31;"But then mashing it up with these water bottles that have like really like"
17:31;17:34;"positive affirmative statements. Like you're the best. Keep going."
17:34;17:36;"Have you ever seen these ones where you're supposed to drink all the water"
17:36;17:40;"through the day? Yeah. You're amazing. You're a freaking rockstar. Keep going."
17:40;17:42;"This would be maybe funny for like three people."
17:42;17:46;"But if we just put the coffee ones on the water bottle and people can give it to"
17:46;17:50;"each other. And as you drink your whatever, two liters of water,"
17:50;17:54;"it just says, don't even look at me. Now you may speak, whatever."
17:54;17:58;"It's a very niche thing, but for people who are really into these types of"
17:58;18:01;"products, I think maybe somebody would enjoy that type of humor."
18:01;18:04;"Don't even talk to me until I've consumed two liters of water."
18:04;18:11;"Don't stay awake for too long. Don't go to bed."
18:11;18:19;"I'll make a cup of coffee for your head. I'll get you up and going out of bed."
18:19;18:28;"And I promise that one day I'll feel fine."
18:28;18:36;"And I promise that one day I'll feel all right."
18:36;18:44;"And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar. How you like it?"
18:52;18:55;"How you like it?"
18:55;18:59;"The humor really makes me think of Garfield."
18:59;19:01;"I'm just trying to think of like, where did this humor come from?"
19:01;19:06;"I'm thinking Garfield reminds me of like a Garfield poster in like a dentist office."
19:06;19:10;"Yeah, no, it's definitely, it definitely has like that kind of like slightly"
19:10;19:16;"wry grown up newspaper comic vibe. Yeah. Like a little Garfield, a little Dilbert,"
19:16;19:20;"a little Cathy, yeah. It's great stuff."
19:20;19:24;"You know, people talk about like kind of millennials inventing the kind of like"
19:24;19:31;"corny adulting is hard, you know, language, but maybe it really goes back almost."
19:31;19:35;"Adulting is hard. Daddy needs a sippy cup."
19:35;19:38;"But I think truly that actually started with the boomers."
19:38;19:44;"It was like boomer cartoonists who invented this kind of vibe of just like going to work."
19:44;19:48;"Yikes. You know, just like the slightly, yeah, just Mondays."
19:48;19:53;"This kind of just like slightly negative, like life sucks vibe."
19:53;19:56;"I'd rather be fishing. Work sucks."
19:56;20:00;"Don't even talk to me until I've had my coffee. Go to hell."
20:00;20:03;"I bet that must have emerged in like the late 70s."
20:03;20:06;"That's my guess. Garfield started in 78."
20:06;20:11;"The baby boomer generation is really like deep into their careers into the late,"
20:11;20:14;"starting in the late 70s. They're all around 30."
20:14;20:19;"I don't think that those existed like Mondays, like in like 1968."
20:19;20:26;"I think it also makes you wonder we've got to get somebody on like a labor historian,"
20:26;20:32;"a Marxist, a Marxist professor just to talk about like this very modern 20th century"
20:32;20:36;"and now 21st century idea of just like work sucks Mondays."
20:36;20:42;"Like are there antecedents of that in like 19th century, like sweatshops and factories?"
20:42;20:48;"Like in Lowell, Massachusetts, was there kind of like a vibe of like Mondays?"
20:48;20:50;"Work sucks."
20:50;20:54;"No, it was so grim. They're working like 18 hour days. It's so grim."
20:54;21:00;"There's no room for like this kind of existential wry bird's eye view of the world."
21:00;21:02;"And they didn't even have weekends."
21:02;21:07;"That's right. If you're chilling on the weekend, thank a union."
21:07;21:09;"Yeah. Thank the labor movement."
21:09;21:11;"Work sucks."
21:11;21:14;"People walking into some like, there's a cupboard and like soot."
21:14;21:19;"They're walking into some like factory and like some like Charles Dickens nightmare."
21:19;21:22;"And they're just like, dude, work sucks."
21:22;21:28;"Just take a time machine and somebody's just like, just say to the other guys,"
21:28;21:30;"don't even talk to me until I've had my coffee."
21:30;21:34;"When you talk about the Dilberts and stuff, these are people with white collar jobs."
21:34;21:40;"So of course you could imagine that they have the privilege to complain a bit more"
21:40;21:45;"because their job is not pure hell. Maybe it's like, it's a type of mental agony,"
21:45;21:52;"but it's like, you know, if Dilbert wanted to like quit, maybe downsize,"
21:52;21:55;"he probably can make it work at least for a few months."
21:55;21:58;"I'm imagining Dilbert was not living paycheck to paycheck."
21:58;22:00;"Let's get Scott Adams on the phone."
22:00;22:04;"Get to the bottom of this."
22:04;22:06;"Scott Adams, come through."
22:06;22:11;"Yeah, but I know what you mean. Like, is there this kind of like case of the Mondays?"
22:11;22:14;"Don't talk to me until I've had my coffee type stuff."
22:14;22:16;"How much does that exist?"
22:16;22:22;"Is that just like a fundamentally kind of like American middle class thing?"
22:22;22:23;"I think it is."
22:23;22:26;"Yeah, I think I might go back to school and become a labor historian,"
22:26;22:32;"get a PhD in my 300 page dissertation is going to be like case of the Mondays."
22:32;22:37;"Middle class American office culture, humor in a global context."
22:37;22:42;"From Garfield to Dilbert and beyond."
22:42;22:48;"And I'll just be like, just rolling all around the world to various type of work environments"
22:48;22:50;"and be like, yeah, you know, it's interesting."
22:50;22:55;"I couldn't find too many cases of the Mondays around the globe."
22:55;22:58;"You just go full Rivers Cuomo, man. You quit the band."
22:58;23:00;"You become an academic for a while."
23:00;23:07;"Yeah, I was just getting his PhD from Harvard in labor history."
23:07;23:10;"I'm trying to track down the first known case of the Mondays."
23:10;23:15;"The first known case of the Mondays. That's a good title."
23:15;23:16;"Good phrase."
23:16;23:21;"Monday morning, you should look fine."
23:21;23:25;"Friday, I got travel on my mind."
23:25;23:30;"First you love me, then you fade away."
23:30;23:34;"I can't go on believing this way."
23:34;23:39;"I got nothing but love for you."
23:39;23:43;"Tell me what you really want to do."
23:43;23:47;"First you love me, then you get on down the line."
23:47;23:52;"But I don't mind."
23:52;23:57;"I don't mind."
23:57;23:59;"I'll be there if you want me to."
23:59;24:01;"No one else I could ever do."
24:01;24:07;"Got to get some peace in my mind."
24:07;24:12;"We could ask this guy if he ever gets a case of the Mondays because he's not American."
24:12;24:13;"He's English."
24:13;24:18;"And in fact, as far as I'm concerned, I think he's one of the best guitarists of all time."
24:18;24:19;"Damn."
24:19;24:20;"I've always been a massive fan."
24:20;24:22;"I'm very honored to have him on the show."
24:22;24:25;"Johnny Marr coming through."
24:25;24:27;"Famous for his work with the Smiths."
24:27;24:30;"He's also done all sorts of incredible work."
24:30;24:33;"He's played with Talking Heads."
24:33;24:36;"He had a dope band with Bernard Sumner, Electronic."
24:36;24:38;"You know Electronic, Jake?"
24:38;24:39;"I don't know that band, no."
24:39;24:42;"They have a great song called Getting Away With It."
24:42;24:46;"He was in Modest Mouse and he's released a lot of great solo albums."
24:46;24:48;"Anyway, honored to have him on the show."
24:48;24:50;"Let's get Johnny Marr on the horn."
24:50;24:54;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
24:54;24:57;"[phone ringing]"
24:57;24:58;"Hello."
24:58;24:59;"Hey, Johnny."
24:59;25:00;"Welcome to the show."
25:00;25:01;"Thanks for inviting me."
25:01;25:02;"Nice to see you all."
25:02;25:03;"Oh, thanks for coming through."
25:03;25:06;"Yeah, I'm Ezra and you're also joined by Jake and Nick."
25:06;25:07;"I'm Jake."
25:07;25:09;"Hi, Jake."
25:09;25:10;"Pleasure."
25:10;25:12;"Have we met before, Nick?"
25:12;25:13;"I don't believe so."
25:13;25:18;"I will say there's definitely something about my face in general that I do."
25:18;25:22;"I think that I look like people other people have met."
25:22;25:23;"Yeah, it's classic."
25:23;25:26;"You've got like a classic face."
25:26;25:28;"What about my face?"
25:28;25:30;"I'll just get into that."
25:30;25:31;"Wait for it."
25:31;25:33;"[laughter]"
25:33;25:34;"It's definitely not classic, though."
25:34;25:35;"You're one in a billion."
25:35;25:36;"I'll take it."
25:36;25:37;"So where are you, Johnny?"
25:37;25:39;"I'm just in the outskirts of Manchester."
25:39;25:44;"I'm in a little room at the back of my studio where we do some editing."
25:44;25:50;"It's been a really amazing spring day in Manchester for some reason."
25:50;25:51;"Weird."
25:51;25:52;"In February."
25:52;25:53;"Yeah."
25:53;25:54;"Uh-oh."
25:54;25:55;"Yeah, yeah."
25:55;25:56;"So where are you guys?"
25:56;25:57;"Where is everyone?"
25:57;25:58;"New York?"
25:58;25:59;"No, we're all in LA now, actually."
25:59;26:00;"Okay."
26:00;26:01;"Having a pretty typical LA day."
26:01;26:08;"Okay, my first question, and I was just talking about the fact that you're one of my favorite guitarists of all time."
26:08;26:10;"I think you're the greatest."
26:10;26:13;"And so this is a question I've always had, and I feel like I've found bits and pieces of it,"
26:13;26:20;"but it's been very important to me in my development, in my kind of naive guitar style."
26:20;26:24;"When I was growing up and listening to your work, a friend of mine said,"
26:24;26:29;"shout out to my friend Raj, Raj Halder, great musician, smart guy."
26:29;26:34;"We were young, we were in high school, and he said, ""Johnny Marr definitely""--"
26:34;26:37;"and we were listening to early Smith stuff, and he was like,"
26:37;26:41;"""He definitely is influenced by African guitar playing, like High Life."""
26:41;26:44;"And I was like, ""Yeah, it really sounds like it."""
26:44;26:46;"You know, he was listening to This Charming Man."
26:46;26:49;"Then I remember when I was starting Vampire Weekend,"
26:49;26:51;"and I was trying to learn how to play This Charming Man,"
26:51;26:54;"and I was kind of looking at the way you play and this [expletive]"
26:54;26:57;"and whenever I've looked up Johnny Marr, High Life, whatever,"
26:57;26:59;"you always find these articles where people say,"
26:59;27:03;"""Oh, Johnny Marr is influenced by so many different guitarists, this and that, including High Life."""
27:03;27:09;"And I've never actually found the quote where you make that connection explicit,"
27:09;27:11;"other than saying that you're like a fan of the music."
27:11;27:13;"So I've always wondered this."
27:13;27:18;"So just like late '70s, early '80s Manchester, young Johnny Marr playing guitar."
27:18;27:21;"Were you listening to High Life? And if so, what?"
27:21;27:22;"Not at all."
27:22;27:23;"Not at all?"
27:23;27:26;"Not in no way whatsoever."
27:26;27:28;"I didn't know what High Life was."
27:28;27:35;"When This Charming Man came out, and I guess a short time after it,"
27:35;27:39;"it was appearing, what you've just described started to happen."
27:39;27:43;"So I was like, ""Oh, right. I better find out what High Life's about."""
27:43;27:48;"So it was, and John Peel, then I was noticing it on John Peel,"
27:48;27:51;"but I didn't know anything about King Sonny a day."
27:51;27:54;"I didn't know anything about anyone, you know?"
27:54;27:59;"So no. And you know what I quite like about that?"
27:59;28:02;"I can see why people ask that question and why people put two and two together."
28:02;28:05;"And it makes me realize that what I was doing,"
28:05;28:09;"not just on This Charming Man, but a few of those other early things,"
28:09;28:10;"is kind of eccentric."
28:10;28:14;"And I'm like, ""What the f*** were you thinking?"""
28:14;28:18;"That's to me is a very innocent."
28:18;28:20;"A lot of it's to do with being the age I was at."
28:20;28:25;"I mean, I knew plenty for a kid of my age. So what was 18, 19 then?"
28:25;28:28;"And I've been in plenty of bands, but I honestly was not doing that."
28:28;28:32;"And I like this thing that you're describing, this guitar technique."
28:32;28:37;"I like that that is a feature of my playing because I can't really say where I got it from."
28:37;28:41;"It's just me just trying to pick out, just really trying to pick out a melody."
28:41;28:46;"But the one thing that is a part of it is culturally,"
28:46;28:48;"to get slightly pretentious about it,"
28:48;28:53;"a big part of what was going on was in '80, '81, '82."
28:53;28:55;"And it sounds like you will know about this."
28:55;28:59;"Myself and my peers were dealt, as guitar players,"
28:59;29:03;"and I'm sure it's the same for bass players and singers and other people in the arts."
29:03;29:07;"We were dealt a hand of cards, if you like,"
29:07;29:09;"that said that I mustn't be blues rock,"
29:09;29:11;"that I mustn't have too many effects on,"
29:11;29:15;"that I mustn't be cliched, that I mustn't be too classic rock."
29:15;29:19;"There's all these like impositions and restrictions, okay?"
29:19;29:25;"And how myself and my peers dealt with those restrictions made you interested."
29:25;29:29;"And so Roddy Frayn from Aztec Camera, he dealt with it his way."
29:29;29:32;"Charlie Birchall from Simple Minds dealt with it in his way."
29:32;29:35;"Will Sargent from the Bunnymen dealt with it in his way."
29:35;29:37;"And so there's no distortion."
29:37;29:39;"There's no sustain."
29:39;29:40;"That was a no-no."
29:40;29:45;"Even Jordy from Killing Joke, who's got a very menacing,"
29:45;29:49;"sort of very, say, distorted sound, he wasn't playing blues rock."
29:49;29:54;"So my point being is that because there was a whole load of sounds that I couldn't beat,"
29:54;29:57;"I had to, in one way, it made me play that way."
29:57;29:59;"A, I'm a melody freak."
29:59;30:02;"B, approach is slightly eccentric."
30:02;30:06;"And C, I had to do something with that skinny little sound."
30:06;30:09;"So it meant that I had to play quite a lot, hyperactively."
30:09;30:10;"- Correct. - Right."
30:10;30:11;"- That makes sense."
30:11;30:12;"- Yeah, oh, totally."
30:12;30:13;"No, that's amazing to hear."
30:13;30:16;"I truly have wondered about this for years."
30:16;30:20;"And it really is, it's amazing to hear it straight from you because it's the type of thing,"
30:20;30:24;"yeah, I'm sure you're on record and also you'd have a long, illustrious career."
30:24;30:28;"I'm sure at this point in your life, you've probably heard everything and you've taken bits and pieces."
30:28;30:30;"But yeah, it's so interesting to me to think about."
30:30;30:31;"So how old were you exactly?"
30:31;30:33;"Why don't we just focus on this Charming Man?"
30:33;30:38;"And I can see how you were operating within these restrictions of what felt cool and fresh at the time."
30:38;30:43;"And you weren't going to be like ripping like Clapton blues solos or tune like heavy distorted stuff."
30:43;30:48;"But so when you're working on this Charming Man, were you, you were like 18 or 19?"
30:48;30:50;"- Yeah, I thought probably 19."
30:50;30:52;"Yeah, I wrote it in about 20 seconds."
30:52;30:53;"- And that was like 80?"
30:53;30:54;"- No, no, no."
30:54;30:57;"The band would go in, what happened was we'd already had a single out."
30:57;31:02;"And over here in the UK at that time, the John Peel show was like the thing."
31:02;31:03;"- Right."
31:03;31:09;"- Radio DJ John Peel had this late night show and he used to play counterculture music."
31:09;31:14;"So our peers, if you, you know, obviously pre, pre-internet."
31:14;31:19;"So if you were like a, I don't even think it was called indie then, but if you were like an indie kid, say, right?"
31:19;31:25;"And you had interest in music, you would listen to John Peel every night, every weeknight between,"
31:25;31:29;"I guess it was like nine, midnight or nine and 11 or something like that."
31:29;31:30;"- Yeah."
31:30;31:31;"- He would play really obscure stuff."
31:31;31:33;"Sometimes he'd play B-Far."
31:33;31:38;"Now John Peel, by the way, he went back to the '60s, to 1968, '69."
31:38;31:40;"He became an institution."
31:40;31:46;"There isn't really, this is a clumsy way of putting it, but he's almost like what Rodney Bingham Hire was,"
31:46;31:48;"was to the West Coast in a way."
31:48;31:49;"- Yeah, on K-Rock."
31:49;31:50;"- Yeah, so counterculture."
31:50;31:52;"So he was your go-to guy."
31:52;31:59;"And you would hear B-Far and you would hear lots of The Fall and you would hear like loads, Joy Division and all of that."
31:59;32:01;"This was when I was a kid, right?"
32:01;32:08;"But he would do these sessions where you would go into the BBC, usually an unsigned band or a fledgling band,"
32:08;32:10;"and you would record four songs in a day."
32:10;32:15;"So we had, the Smiths did our very first John Peel session."
32:15;32:17;"This is before this charming man, right?"
32:17;32:19;"We did, so maybe we had 10 songs."
32:19;32:20;"- Like Hand and Glove?"
32:20;32:21;"- Yeah, maybe we had 10."
32:21;32:22;"- Probably, yeah."
32:22;32:26;"- We did Handsome Devil, Hand and Glove, Miserable Lie, and something else."
32:26;32:28;"Hand That Rocks the Cradle, I think."
32:28;32:31;"So we did that session and it blew up."
32:31;32:32;"It was a big deal."
32:32;32:37;"So then straight we got another session a few weeks down the line."
32:37;32:44;"And about a week before that session happened, I got out of bed 10 a.m. one morning, which was early for me."
32:44;32:47;"And I thought, ""Sh*t, we need a fast one."""
32:47;32:48;"- Yeah."
32:48;32:51;"- We need something in a major key, pretty sharpish."
32:51;32:54;"So I just played the chords and then I played the riff on top of it."
32:54;32:56;"And I was just like, ""Right, bang. Okay, bingo."""
32:56;33:00;"So, I mean, you'll know yourself being a musician when it was a bit like needs must."
33:00;33:04;"I didn't know I'd be talking about it 40 years later or whatever, you know?"
33:04;33:05;"- Right, right, right."
33:05;33:14;"- And I just laid that, so I had these chords, G, A minor, D, and then I just laid that top line on this,"
33:14;33:17;"because I had a cassette machine that I could overdub on."
33:17;33:19;"I wasn't even dressed, I hadn't had breakfast or anything."
33:19;33:22;"I was just kind of like, ""Ah, do your homework. We need a track."""
33:22;33:23;"So I did that."
33:23;33:24;"- Yeah, yeah."
33:24;33:25;"- And it all just came together."
33:25;33:30;"And so my critical faculties were completely down and it was just a really..."
33:30;33:35;"It was a little bit like, you know, adversity, just probably adversity, you know?"
33:35;33:36;"So what's the phrase?"
33:36;33:38;"It's a mother of invention."
33:38;33:39;"What is it?"
33:39;33:40;"- Necessity."
33:40;33:41;"- Yeah."
33:41;33:42;"Necessity is the mother of invention."
33:42;33:43;"Yeah, that's..."
33:43;33:44;"Thank you."
33:44;33:46;"So that's kind of how it happened."

35:10;35:12;"what would you have said were your influences?"
35:12;35:14;"Or is it more just the way you put it?"
35:14;35:15;"You were actually..."
35:15;35:17;"It was more about what you were trying not to be."
35:17;35:21;"I think at that age, whether you're in the arts or not,"
35:21;35:23;"when you've got that teenage thing going,"
35:23;35:26;"there's plenty of trying to not be things."
35:26;35:28;"You don't want to be on hip."
35:28;35:31;"You don't want to be, I don't know what the American term is."
35:31;35:35;"Back when I was in the States, it was all about don't be a jock."
35:35;35:37;"That's what alternative is."
35:37;35:40;"So it was kind of like, my frame of mind, to be honest, right?"
35:40;35:41;"This is the deal."
35:41;35:42;"When I formed the band,"
35:42;35:45;"sure I was hoping that we were going to be big,"
35:45;35:49;"but it was more important that my pals thought we were cool."
35:49;35:52;"And my pals, the music we were listening to"
35:52;35:54;"was really not at all commercial."
35:54;35:57;"I mean, the early Smith stuff is unusual music"
35:57;35:59;"with unusual singing on the top."
35:59;36:00;"Oh, absolutely."
36:00;36:01;"The very early stuff."
36:01;36:04;"And I kind of thought that's where we'd be."
36:04;36:06;"So the bands that I was listening to,"
36:06;36:09;"I was really super, super into the Gun Club."
36:09;36:10;"Oh yeah."
36:10;36:12;"And before that, leading up to the Smiths,"
36:12;36:14;"I was really into the Cramps."
36:14;36:17;"And I was into the early psychedelic furs."
36:17;36:20;"But when I put the band together,"
36:20;36:23;"you sort of taste change almost every three weeks."
36:23;36:26;"You get a new agenda, a new manifesto every three weeks."
36:26;36:30;"So, you know, there was a label out of Scotland called Postcard"
36:30;36:32;"that had this band called Joseph Kaeun."
36:32;36:36;"And then Rough Trade also had the Monochrome set"
36:36;36:38;"and they were a little kind of literate."
36:38;36:40;"And then plus I'd met Matt Johnson,"
36:40;36:42;"who was putting together The There at that time,"
36:42;36:44;"and he'd done a solo record."
36:44;36:47;"So it was all this sort of real kind of classic,"
36:47;36:49;"anything that wasn't the mainstream."
36:49;36:51;"But in my case, I happened to be,"
36:51;36:53;"I wanted to do it on guitar,"
36:53;36:57;"but really a lot of stuff that was inventive was people,"
36:57;37:00;"you know, doing stuff on keyboards and on drum machines"
37:00;37:02;"and sort of slightly industrial."
37:02;37:06;"But I wanted to find a way of a guitar band joining in."
37:06;37:08;"My band being in that space."
37:08;37:09;"Sure."
37:09;37:10;"Well, it's interesting though,"
37:10;37:12;"because a lot of the bands that you're naming are still"
37:12;37:13;"like kind of rock bands."
37:13;37:15;"And I wonder if similar to the High Life thing,"
37:15;37:19;"where that's actually music that you maybe felt a kinship with"
37:19;37:21;"after you'd written a lot of this music."
37:21;37:23;"What about like jazz?"
37:23;37:26;"Because like, or even like Brazilian music,"
37:26;37:29;"because like you're famous for having like such an idiosyncratic"
37:29;37:31;"and sophisticated harmonic sense."
37:31;37:33;"Like when you were 18 or 19,"
37:33;37:35;"did you like know who Pat Metheny was?"
37:35;37:38;"Had you listened to like late Joni Mitchell?"
37:38;37:40;"Oh, I mean, I knew the Hissing of Summer Lawns."
37:40;37:43;"Well, Headmaster Ritual started out like me trying to write something"
37:43;37:45;"like the Hissing of Summer Lawns,"
37:45;37:46;"Edith and the King."
37:46;37:47;"Oh, okay. Oh, well."
37:47;37:50;"The reason that didn't show up for a while was because"
37:50;37:53;"I was almost too embarrassed because it was so jazzy."
37:53;37:54;"I didn't know Pat Metheny."
37:54;37:57;"I wouldn't have liked Pat Metheny back then because he wouldn't have been,"
37:57;37:58;"he would have been too slick."
37:58;38:04;"But I really, I got into McCoy Tyner when I was about 15."
38:04;38:05;"This older guy turned me on to McCoy."
38:05;38:09;"And he, to this day, McCoy Tyner is almost like a saint to me, really."
38:09;38:14;"So, and of course I really loved Nile Rodgers."
38:14;38:16;"And this was when, way after,"
38:16;38:20;"Sheikah had their hits and Nile was playing on the Z label and he was"
38:20;38:23;"playing on all these sessions and was turning up and he was starting to"
38:23;38:26;"produce and he was still having hits with people like Dana Ross and stuff,"
38:26;38:31;"but he was on this track with material on the Z label called I'm The One."
38:31;38:34;"So, because I was going to a lot of clubs and stuff, I was just,"
38:34;38:36;"the minute I got out of bed in the morning,"
38:36;38:39;"I was just soaking everything up, everything, everything."
38:45;38:46;"Oh yeah!"
38:46;38:52;"I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one you want."
38:52;38:57;"I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one you want."
38:57;39:01;"I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one you want."
39:01;39:06;"I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one you want."
39:06;39:12;"I am the one, the only one for you."
39:12;39:14;"Yeah!"
39:14;39:21;"You, you've got to know by now, I'm gonna see it through."
39:21;39:25;"You've got to be the one for me."
39:25;39:29;"Ooh, I love what you do."
39:29;39:33;"Ooh, I know you know it too."
39:33;39:38;"When you're close enough to touch, I can give you so much."
39:38;39:43;"Don't hold back to love you, I'm the one you want."
39:43;39:45;"Were you studying theory at all?"
39:45;39:48;"Or you could listen to McCoy Tyner and Chic"
39:48;39:51;"and kind of start to piece out harmonically what was happening"
39:51;39:53;"and then apply it in The Smiths?"
39:53;39:55;"Just totally by ear, I've got a really good ear."
39:55;39:57;"And it's the only, the only, you know,"
39:57;39:59;"when I do some interviews over the years,"
39:59;40:01;"it's a classic older person answer."
40:01;40:03;"But when I'm asked about having any regrets,"
40:03;40:06;"I, so I have got to that age now where I go,"
40:06;40:10;"probably really wish that I'd listened a little more in music class, you know,"
40:10;40:12;"although the teacher was a ****."
40:12;40:15;"It worked out okay, but theory."
40:15;40:19;"Well, it's interesting because what I'd worked with John for Shanity,"
40:19;40:21;"which was, I guess, I don't remember now,"
40:21;40:24;"maybe 2011 or something like that."
40:24;40:26;"Everything John pulled up in his studio,"
40:26;40:28;"I was just putting the guitar in a tuning."
40:28;40:31;"So I deliberately didn't know what the **** the chords were."
40:31;40:35;"As I remember, he was kind of a bit surprised that I didn't want to know."
40:35;40:39;"What the chords were, I completely wanted to anti-theory."
40:39;40:44;"And that's worked out okay for me, but I was a little like,"
40:44;40:47;"this is going to sound really corny."
40:47;40:49;"It probably is corny, but it worked for me."
40:49;40:53;"When I was about 15, 16, maybe earlier,"
40:53;40:56;"I realized I was a little like a human jukebox in a way."
40:56;40:58;"I can hear changes very well."
40:58;41:00;"I've got a good ear for changes."
41:00;41:03;"That was just something that happened in my house."
41:03;41:05;"Because my family were super musical."
41:05;41:07;"Obviously I knew what one, four, five was."
41:07;41:09;"And I knew what one to six was."
41:09;41:12;"And I could hear seven, all of those sort of things."
41:12;41:15;"I could hear ninths and all of that from being like a little kid,"
41:15;41:17;"didn't know what they were."
41:17;41:21;"And that helped me write songs because I'd be on the bus in school"
41:21;41:25;"and I'd be going, okay, yeah, go to G, you know, G to E minor six."
41:25;41:26;"Yeah, do that three times."
41:26;41:28;"Okay. And then, all right, okay."
41:28;41:30;"Would that be a key change if I go to C sharp minor?"
41:30;41:33;"I just live in my head like that, really."
41:33;41:34;"It worked."
41:34;41:36;"Right. And that makes a lot of sense."
41:36;41:39;"One thing that I'm curious about, thinking about Frusciante,"
41:39;41:43;"so he's kind of famously like a huge like Hendrix acolyte."
41:43;41:47;"Is Hendrix the type of just like classic rock guitar playing that like,"
41:47;41:50;"like how did you feel about Hendrix when you were like 18, 19?"
41:50;41:53;"Well, 18, 19, it wasn't of any use to me, you know what I mean?"
41:53;41:56;"But I've got the classic things like, you know,"
41:56;41:59;"it's probably the same now, 13."
41:59;42:03;"You're a guitar nut and you and your pals, I was really into,"
42:03;42:07;"I was first and foremost, I was super, super into guitar and rock culture."
42:07;42:10;"I was really, really into girls and I was really into football."
42:10;42:15;"And so at 13, 14, just before punk happened,"
42:15;42:18;"I'd go and see every single band that was around."
42:18;42:20;"So I didn't care whether I liked them or not."
42:20;42:22;"Most of the time I didn't like them."
42:22;42:23;"Thin Lizzy were great."
42:23;42:25;"I saw Thin Lizzy a lot."
42:25;42:27;"And I liked Rory Gallaher as well."
42:27;42:31;"So one of my pals was really super into Ritchie Blackmore."
42:31;42:33;"So I knew about what he was doing."
42:33;42:36;"Another one of my pals was really into Jimmy Page."
42:36;42:39;"Another one who was Billy Duffy from the cult."
42:39;42:43;"He was really into Paul Kossoff and Ronson and Townsend."
42:43;42:47;"So me and all my mates all had our own little bits of speciality and I would"
42:47;42:49;"like find what was interesting."
42:49;42:52;"So I knew, so by the time I was 17, 18,"
42:52;42:56;"I knew that my favourite Jimi Hendrix track was Easy Rider."
42:56;43:01;"And I knew that I felt that my favourite album was Electric Ladyland,"
43:01;43:02;"hands down."
43:02;43:05;"I've never changed my opinion about that, you know, 1983."
43:05;43:09;"And Rainy Day Dream Away and all, I just, I'd soaked all of that up."
43:09;43:12;"But it was of no use to me at that point, you know?"
43:12;43:14;"It was of no use to me."
43:14;43:17;"I knew it, but like I know loads of stuff now."
43:17;43:19;"Well, you could always know more."
43:19;43:22;"But as an artist, I think, especially in this day and age,"
43:22;43:24;"you know, of information overload."
43:24;43:29;"I tune out what isn't of much use for me, you know, but I like stuff,"
43:29;43:33;"music. I like, I love John McLaughlin."
43:33;43:37;"Right. So is John McLaughlin somebody that you got into later in life?"
43:37;43:41;"In about '98 with Shakti."
43:41;43:46;"I got into John McLaughlin and then I re-evaluated Jimi Hendrix because I got"
43:46;43:51;"super into John Coltrane. I understood what these guys are doing."
43:51;43:52;"I get it."
43:52;43:54;"They're like, it's like praying."
43:54;43:58;"You get so adept on the instrument, you practice, you get adept on it,"
43:58;44:01;"that the instrument almost becomes invisible and you just go,"
44:01;44:06;"you just emote and there is no barrier between you and what you're"
44:06;44:10;"expressing. That's what I understand John Coltrane was trying to do."
44:10;44:14;"Are you a fan of that McLaughlin Santana record?"
44:14;44:17;"Not massively, no."
44:17;44:19;"They cover Love Supreme on that."
44:19;44:22;"I think the record's called A Love Supreme."
44:22;44:23;"It's called A Love and Devotion."
44:23;44:26;"The same, Love Supreme to the Coltrane."
44:26;44:30;"No, no, but they cover Love Supreme track one. I love that record."
44:30;44:33;"Oh, they're just like, let's redo Love Supreme."
44:33;44:38;"Yeah. Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin just like trading solos."
44:38;44:41;"Although I feel like McLaughlin kind of buries Santana a little bit,"
44:41;44:44;"but I'm into that record."
44:44;44:50;"Yeah. No, I, I, I mean, you know, people just will not believe it,"
44:50;44:53;"but sometimes I just think Shakti is the greatest group that ever was,"
44:53;44:54;"you know."
44:54;44:55;"Interesting."
45:23;45:28;"Have you ever gotten into like improvisatory music personally?"
45:28;45:33;"Like what's like the longest solo you've ever ripped on record or off?"
45:33;45:37;"Interestingly enough, I did this movie,"
45:37;45:39;"first movie I was involved with is called Colors."
45:39;45:44;"It was a Dennis Hopper movie. It was about kind of the gang thing."
45:44;45:46;"And the opening sequence, you know, it's like with movies,"
45:46;45:50;"they just get chopped down, but the original opening sequence was really long."
45:50;45:52;"It was amazing."
45:52;45:57;"It was the first thing I played on and it was me and Charlie Drayton and Steve Jordan."
45:57;46:02;"And it was this real kind of voodoo-y, they had this really heavy thing going."
46:02;46:05;"And it was, I'm scared out of my wits really."
46:05;46:10;"And I hadn't even met Dennis Hopper yet, but it's this true story."
46:10;46:16;"Herbie Hancock was the MD and I went into the studio and we had the opening scene on the screen"
46:16;46:21;"and they put down this groove and it must've been seven or eight minutes."
46:21;46:24;"And I was just playing over the top of it."
46:24;46:27;"And then about two minutes into this thing,"
46:27;46:34;"I felt this presence right up against my face and Dennis Hopper had come in the studio,"
46:34;46:37;"checked me out. He's just right in my face and he was going,"
46:37;46:41;"""Make it sound like the cops, man. Make it sound like the cops."""
46:41;46:44;"(laughs)"
46:44;46:46;"See the guitar represented the police?"
46:46;46:48;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
46:48;46:52;"And I started playing kind of out of my skin, really,"
46:52;46:55;"trying to make all these noises and doing all these dive bombs and all stuff"
46:55;46:57;"that people wouldn't think that I'd be doing."
46:57;47:01;"But he was like, ""What was the character in Blue Velvet? Is it Frank?"""
47:01;47:04;"Oh yeah, that really scary Dennis Hopper guy."
47:04;47:06;"He was kind of that thing."
47:06;47:11;"And we got through the end of this music, which eventually, movies being movies,"
47:11;47:14;"it really got cut or maybe it's just a slither in the film now."
47:14;47:17;"But right at the end of it, I played this thing."
47:17;47:19;"I mean, I was really, really digging it."
47:19;47:23;"And he got right in my face and he just grinned and he just said,"
47:23;47:27;"he just went, ""I like you, Johnny."" And I was like..."
47:27;47:28;"(laughs)"
47:28;47:29;"Whoa."
47:29;47:30;"Okay."
47:30;47:34;"We got to find this tape, man. We got to hear the whole like eight minute..."
47:34;47:35;"Rip."
47:35;47:40;"Johnny Marr, Herbie Hancock produced psychedelic LAPD music."
47:40;47:41;"Yeah."
47:41;47:42;"(laughs)"
47:42;47:43;"It was out there."
47:43;47:48;"But, you know, the older I get, the more I just sort of appreciate,"
47:48;47:51;"trying to appreciate music in an impressionistic way, if I can."
47:51;47:54;"It's one of the reasons why I like the jazz I like."
47:54;47:58;"I don't sit there going, ""Oh, right. Okay. The bass player is trying to be Flea."
47:58;48:01;"The programming sounds a little bit like MGMT."""
48:01;48:04;"And you know that (beep) that we all do?"
48:04;48:07;"I just deal with it like an impressionistic painting."
48:07;48:10;"And I really love that because it gives me my innocence back."
48:10;48:13;"You know, I just don't know how it's put together."
48:13;48:17;"Hey, don't get me wrong. I don't like anything that just goes squawk."
48:17;48:20;"I like something that's a good listen."
48:20;48:25;"But, you know, the stuff I do like, I absolutely adore, you know,"
48:25;48:29;"Horace Silver, Bill Evans, as I say, you know, McCoy Tyne and stuff like that."
48:29;48:32;"But I just, that gets me away from my day job."
48:32;48:34;"I can just enjoy that kind of music."
48:34;48:37;"And same with stuff like ETO Peaks, you know."
48:37;48:38;"I can really..."
48:38;48:39;"Oh, yeah. Amazing music."
48:39;48:43;"I can really enjoy these time signatures and I can just, it's great."
48:43;48:47;"But I don't want to make that music, which is interesting, you know,"
48:47;48:52;"because when I had that band The Healers in the early 2000s,"
48:52;48:55;"I learned a lesson, which is that it's not your job really"
48:55;49:01;"to just lay your enthusiasms on an audience, you know, just save it for home."
49:01;49:03;"Because we used to do some gigs with that band."
49:03;49:06;"We played a festival somewhere where I just sat on the stage"
49:06;49:11;"and I just watched this six-piece band I had just jam for about seven minutes."
49:11;49:13;"No one needs that."
49:13;49:14;"Well, I guess it depends on the audience."
49:14;49:17;"That actually is a good tee up for my next question,"
49:17;49:19;"which is something we talk about a lot on the show."
49:19;49:27;"Do you have any relationship or enthusiasm, history with The Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia?"
49:27;49:33;"My previous manager, John Moss, who died in 2016,"
49:33;49:37;"he was a very philosophical, he was a big stoner."
49:37;49:42;"He was one of the original beatniks, you know, from the 60s and stuff."
49:42;49:45;"You know, he died too young, but he was in his 70s."
49:45;49:47;"He was an amazing, amazing man."
49:47;49:52;"And he used to always, not always, but he often tried to indoctrinate me"
49:52;49:54;"and he tried to wise me up to the ways of the dead."
49:54;49:55;"So I get it."
49:55;49:58;"It's just not, it's just too inflected to me."
49:58;49:59;"I have a kind of..."
49:59;50:00;"What inflected?"
50:00;50:03;"Country inflected."
50:03;50:05;"Ah, see, I would have thought that you would like country"
50:05;50:09;"because that really great like chicken picking country guitar"
50:09;50:11;"that's kind of bright and clean."
50:11;50:14;"That doesn't feel like a million miles away from stuff you might like."
50:14;50:18;"No, well, my parents are absolute aficionados of country."
50:18;50:20;"So, I mean, you kind of rebel really."
50:20;50:23;"And, you know, I know all about, I love, you know, I mean,"
50:23;50:25;"I love Loretta Lynn as a person."
50:25;50:29;"I'm really in mind, you know, and, you know, all of that stuff."
50:29;50:35;"And the players and I really respect them, but the dead,"
50:35;50:39;"I like what they represented, but no, it's too noodley for me."
50:39;50:42;"Just too noodley and not enough minor chords."
50:42;50:44;"Can we make you a playlist of like some..."
50:44;50:47;"Yeah, there's a lot of non-country dead."
50:47;50:49;"The first album's good."
50:49;50:50;"You like the first one?"
50:50;50:51;"The first album?"
50:51;50:52;"Yeah."
50:52;50:53;"Interesting."
50:53;50:54;"Yeah."
50:54;50:55;"Do you know the song Eyes of the World?"
50:55;50:56;"No."
50:56;50:57;"I feel like you might like Eyes of the World"
50:57;50:59;"because it's like, it's very un-country."
50:59;51:00;"Don't even want to go there."
51:00;51:03;"I don't hate country, but it's just too,"
51:03;51:05;"they need to like wake up."
51:05;51:08;"That's one of the, a very perceptive answer to that question."
51:08;51:12;"It's one of the more interesting answers I've had is because in the US,"
51:12;51:15;"because of course the dead is hugely influenced by country"
51:15;51:17;"and that's such a, they literally cover country songs."
51:17;51:20;"And even in a lot of what they did, there's a country influence."
51:20;51:22;"In the US, when you ask people that question, do you like the dead?"
51:22;51:26;"People might say, I don't like that psychedelic drug stuff, whatever."
51:26;51:30;"But I've never heard anybody say, I'm not into the country element even,"
51:30;51:31;"but you're very right."
51:31;51:32;"That's a huge part of it."
51:32;51:33;"Yeah."
51:34;51:38;"I mean, I like what they represent, what they represent is f***ing cool."
51:38;51:41;"But I think Modest Mouse represent the same thing,"
51:41;51:43;"but in a new century kind of way."
51:43;51:45;"Oh, that's interesting."
51:45;51:49;"I mean, that is the highest compliment I can pay to the Grateful Dead."
51:49;51:50;"Interesting."
51:50;51:51;"Tell us more about that."
51:51;51:54;"What's the connection between Modest Mouse and the dead?"
51:54;51:57;"Well, I got the impression that, because I've got some friends,"
51:57;52:00;"American friends who really love the dead, right?"
52:00;52:04;"Believe in Jerry Garcia being of them."
52:04;52:08;"They like that the dead are a big band and they got no problem"
52:08;52:11;"going and watching in large numbers."
52:11;52:12;"Yep."
52:12;52:14;"Which is a really cool thing I think about Americans."
52:14;52:16;"They're not kind of so precious about it."
52:16;52:18;"They will share that band."
52:18;52:20;"But I heard this when I was in Modest Mouse,"
52:20;52:25;"that there was a thing about the dead where they had a room full of phones."
52:25;52:27;"And if you wanted to find out where they were playing,"
52:27;52:31;"you would have to phone some, you would have to try and phone them up."
52:31;52:32;"Yeah, that sounds right."
52:32;52:35;"Because they were pioneers of like how to connect with the fans"
52:35;52:36;"and they had their own office."
52:36;52:37;"Yeah, that makes sense."
52:37;52:42;"They played when they f***ing wanted, where they f***ing wanted."
52:42;52:43;"Ah."
52:43;52:44;"And the audience knew that."
52:44;52:47;"You feel like the independent spirit of doing what you want,"
52:47;52:52;"connecting directly with fans, you see that spirit alive in Modest Mouse."
52:52;52:53;"Absolutely, yeah."
52:53;52:57;"I learned a lot being in Modest Mouse."
52:57;53:02;"I learned a lot about American culture, which was fascinating to me"
53:02;53:06;"because I'd been already a professional musician for a long time by then."
53:06;53:09;"And I always say it was like one of the best times of my life."
53:09;53:13;"And I'm not being sentimental when I say that."
53:13;53:16;"But that audience, I mean, for a start,"
53:16;53:20;"some of the shows we played were just really transcendent."
53:20;53:24;"And then you just didn't know how it was going to go from night to night,"
53:24;53:27;"which is another thing that reminds me of what I've heard about."
53:27;53:30;"We used to play long shows."
53:30;53:32;"I really liked playing to that audience."
53:32;53:37;"I learned so much, you know, like the way skate culture has informed rock music."
53:37;53:38;"I learned all about that. I didn't know about that."
53:38;53:41;"I didn't know about, didn't know that straight edge was a thing."
53:41;53:46;"I didn't know that straight edge was what it really went progressively, you know,"
53:46;53:50;"and about what I then took on board."
53:50;53:54;"Oh, okay. When Americans say punk rock, it really means something."
53:54;53:58;"And it means something when my generation of British people used to say punk rock,"
53:58;54:00;"but it meant something slightly different."
54:00;54:05;"But so, yeah, I found out quite a lot playing in front of Modest Mouse."
54:05;54:10;"Cause you know, I'd never been in a band with like a standup bass or a lap steel."
54:10;54:14;"You know, we're playing these badass f***ing riffs that were almost like,"
54:14;54:19;"sometimes I was like, we sound like the birthday party, but there's a banjo going on."
54:19;54:21;"What the f*** is that?"
54:21;54:24;"Yeah. And the subject matter. Oh man."
54:24;54:27;"Great band and needed great work and Modest Mouse."

55:22;55:24;"♪ Yeah, here we go ♪"
55:24;55:30;"When you joined Modest Mouse, you had a family,"
55:30;55:34;"and your whole family moved from Manchester to Portland for five years?"
55:34;55:36;"That's how it went down?"
55:36;55:40;"Well, no, my kids had to keep travelling back and forwards and they missed quite a lot."
55:40;55:41;"Oh, okay."
55:41;55:44;"That was the longest I've spent away from my family."
55:44;55:47;"I've been with my wife since we were 15 and they just got on board"
55:47;55:50;"and every opportunity they came over."
55:50;55:54;"So you probably went back and forth, but you were kind of based in Portland?"
55:54;56:00;"I went back very rarely because our tours, it wasn't worth it."
56:00;56:03;"Because when we took a break, that band toured so much."
56:03;56:05;"The longest time I had off, I remember, was like 10 days."
56:05;56:06;"There's no point going back."
56:06;56:08;"And was that the most you toured in your life?"
56:08;56:10;"Like, did the Smiths ever tour that hard?"
56:10;56:13;"No. The The toured that hard."
56:13;56:15;"Oh, yeah, right. The The."
56:15;56:18;"And how did you find it, living in Portland?"
56:18;56:21;"And also, I'm just curious, in your entire life,"
56:21;56:25;"you've either lived in Manchester or this period in Portland,"
56:25;56:27;"like you never moved to London or anything?"
56:27;56:29;"Oh, no, I've lived in London a bunch."
56:29;56:30;"Oh, you've lived in London a bunch."
56:30;56:32;"In the Smiths days, on and off, we'd live in London,"
56:32;56:37;"but my main house was in Manchester and then I rented twice."
56:37;56:39;"Staying in Kirsten McColl's flat quite a lot."
56:39;56:43;"So we'd go through periods where we'd be London-based,"
56:43;56:45;"but I would always be jumping in my car."
56:45;56:48;"My dad was my school buddy and he loved driving."
56:48;56:50;"And you know what it's like in the UK,"
56:50;56:53;"you just get in the car and two and a half hours later,"
56:53;56:55;"we'd just be driving up and down the motorway"
56:55;56:58;"and I'd have my feet on the dashboard with my buddy driving"
56:58;57:02;"and smoking spliffs and listening to Velvet Underground"
57:02;57:05;"and Everly Brothers and stuff like that, Benny King."
57:05;57:09;"But was Portland the only time you really lived outside of the UK?"
57:09;57:10;"Yeah."
57:10;57:13;"So how did you find this whole American experience?"
57:13;57:17;"It was an amazing bit of, I don't know whether it was synchronicity or what,"
57:17;57:21;"because early 2000s in the UK, I just, it might have been my age"
57:21;57:26;"or where I was at, but I didn't like rock music that was happening in the UK."
57:26;57:28;"Everything was like a very, as I remember it,"
57:28;57:33;"everyone was just trying to do a sort of very pale version of OK Computer."
57:33;57:36;"And there was a lot of the start of this acoustic troubadour thing"
57:36;57:37;"that was going on."
57:37;57:42;"And the guitar music that was interesting was Jeff Buckley."
57:42;57:47;"But I met Elliot Smith in late 90s."
57:47;57:49;"Elliot was on his second album then, I think."
57:49;57:51;"And he told me about Portland."
57:51;57:55;"And around about the same time, maybe because I was listening to Elliot,"
57:55;57:58;"I got into, well, maybe Elliot turned me on to Built to Spill."
57:58;58:00;"Hmm. BTS."
58:00;58:04;"But the big thing was that Broken Social Scene came out."
58:04;58:08;"So I suddenly was like, oh, I'm saved."
58:08;58:10;"Guitar music is alive and well."
58:10;58:15;"Doug Marsh and it's Elliot and it's Kevin Drew."
58:15;58:17;"And I loved the Lilies."
58:17;58:19;"Kurt Heasley."
58:19;58:21;"Kurt Heasley, man, I thought the Lilies were real."
58:21;58:22;"I don't know them very well."
58:22;58:25;"I think they're from out of Massachusetts or Boston or something."
58:25;58:29;"So I loved all of that, but I kept hearing about Modest Mouse."
58:29;58:31;"So it's like all roads led to Modest Mouse."
58:31;58:35;"Someone, I don't know, I heard a long time, Crowded West on a tour bus."
58:35;58:37;"And I thought this is really interesting."
58:37;58:40;"And then, Antarctica."
58:40;58:43;"So I was really swimming in all of that music that was kind of saving me,"
58:43;58:44;"American music."
58:44;58:46;"I didn't like what was going on in the UK."
58:46;58:50;"And I got out of the blue, Isaac Brock called me up and literally asked me to"
58:50;58:51;"join the band."
58:51;58:53;"And I was like, I don't know."
58:53;58:54;"You never met before?"
58:54;58:55;"I didn't even know him."
58:55;58:56;"He asked me to join the band."
58:56;58:57;"Yeah."
58:57;58:59;"And that was really, really funny."
58:59;59:01;"I thought I was really funny."
59:01;59:06;"And I reverted to the person that I was when I was 14 when bands used to say,"
59:06;59:09;"my friend used to say, well, that band want you to join."
59:09;59:11;"And they live, you know, they want you."
59:11;59:16;"And I was like, well, that might make, they sound interesting."
59:16;59:18;"So there wasn't any great, you know,"
59:18;59:21;"it wasn't like me in a management company sitting there in a record company"
59:21;59:23;"going, Hey, Johnny Mara, Modest Mouse, we'll do this."
59:23;59:26;"You know, I just thought, okay, I'll head over there."
59:26;59:28;"We'll have a 10 day experiment."
59:28;59:32;"We got together in the first night, we stayed up real late and we wrote a few,"
59:32;59:35;"me and Isaac just jammed and we wrote a few songs the very first night and then"
59:35;59:36;"we were off then."
59:36;59:42;"And each day another person would arrive with an instrument."
59:42;59:46;"So another drummer had arrived, another, someone with a bass,"
59:46;59:48;"someone with a flute, someone with an accordion."
59:48;59:49;"I'm like, what the f**k?"
59:49;59:53;"And then about five days in, we were jamming and everyone has assembled."
59:53;59:56;"This really interesting bunch of people that I really took to,"
59:56;59:58;"we got really tight straight away."
59:58;59:59;"And you know what?"
59:59;01:00:02;"I was stood there in the afternoon one and we were jamming."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"We'd been writing really,"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"we really inspired these tunes were coming out."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"Mostly me and Isaac were starting these tunes and everyone was joining in"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"and it was happening."
01:00:10;01:00:12;"I stood there and I went, you know what?"
01:00:12;01:00:16;"I've come over, I still am none the wiser."
01:00:16;01:00:22;"I don't know what this music is, but I f**king feel really good."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"And that reminded me of, you know, when you, when you're a youngster"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"and you're in a band and you don't know enough to be like, oh, okay,"
01:00:28;01:00:32;"this is like an Havana riff or this is like, you're just doing it."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"And it just feels great."
01:00:34;01:00:35;"I was in my forties."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"I went, how did that happen?"
01:00:36;01:00:40;"I'm with a studio in a room with these really cool people I really like."
01:00:40;01:00:44;"And I have no idea what it is we're doing, but it feels really good."
01:00:44;01:00:48;"So I was like, well, that's a good, great reason to stay."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"And I fell in love with, I love the city, you know?"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"Yeah. You just enjoyed being there."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Early 2000s Portland."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Yeah."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"I was like, I guess like, oh yeah."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"I remember hearing Johnny Mark crossover."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"I remember living, I was living in Portland."
01:01:03;01:01:09;"I remember hearing Johnny Marr move to town and I was like, wow, that's far out."
01:01:09;01:01:12;"Man, I was running around there cause I was super into running."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"And I'd be running around all, you know, in the mornings I was jet lagged,"
01:01:15;01:01:16;"always jet lagged."
01:01:16;01:01:19;"Cause for the first few visits I would coming back and then going back."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Oh yeah."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"Running around looking at, I was just like, I love this place."
01:01:23;01:01:27;"And, um, I think, you know, Portlandia, you know, when Fred and Carrie,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"you know, that when that first came out,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"that was pretty much a documentary."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"That was exactly what Portland was."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Yeah."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"That was the Portland that you knew."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"It was like reality TV."
01:01:39;01:01:43;"While we're on the subject, could we change the subject now?"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"I was knocking on your ears, don't you?"
01:01:46;01:01:50;"You were always out looking towards the future."
01:01:50;01:01:52;"We were begging for the past."
01:01:52;01:01:57;"Well, we know we had the good things, but those never seemed to last."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Oh, please just last."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Everyone's unhappy."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"Everyone's ashamed."
01:02:11;01:02:16;"Well, we all just got caught looking at somebody else's page."
01:02:16;01:02:20;"Well, nothing ever went quite exactly as we planned."
01:02:20;01:02:25;"Our ideas held no water, but we used them like they were."
01:02:25;01:02:31;"Oh, and we carried it all so well."
01:02:31;01:02:35;"As if we got a new position."
01:02:35;01:02:41;"Oh, and I would laugh all the way to hell."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"I'd say yes to the fine promotion."
01:02:44;01:02:50;"Oh, and I would laugh all the way to hell."
01:02:50;01:02:51;"How many you brought up running?"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"I just have one question."
01:02:52;01:02:55;"So last night, so I know you're an avid runner."
01:02:55;01:02:58;"You know, I think some of us on this show are as well."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"Last night we're talking, I know you did the marathon."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Do you still do long runs?"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"At the moment, no, because I'm promoting."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"You know, when you, no, I don't."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"I do 15 miles, something like that."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"That's a long one for me now."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"When you do a long run like that, I would say that's a long run for anybody."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"When you do that, do you listen to music?"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:17;01:03:21;"You don't go natural just in your head."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"All right."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"That's how Jake does."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"I'm listening to music."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"Jake just goes, he's in his head."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"I go silence."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"I'm really impressed with that."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"I'd love to."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"That's so great."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"I'm not running 15 miles."
01:03:35;01:03:38;"I'm running three, four, five miles."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"And I just, I'm surrounded by media and crap all day that I,"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"if I'm going to run for whatever, half hour, 40 minutes,"
01:03:46;01:03:49;"I like to have silence and just be with my thoughts and see what happens."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"But that's just me."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"That's great."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"Yeah."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"I mean, if I do 15, 15 is the longest I will do now,"
01:03:55;01:04:00;"but regularly I'll do whatever 12K, 10, 12K a few times a week."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Nothing like I was doing."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"I was forest gum for hours."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Like 18 miles before a show, man."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"And you've always would listen to music."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"Oh yeah."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Run."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Always listen to music."
01:04:11;01:04:14;"And so much of my solo stuff, but not so much this new album,"
01:04:14;01:04:17;"but the first couple of albums I did, the solo stuff,"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"the tempos are so up because I was getting up."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"Here's one I was running, you know,"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"I was like, listen to a load of like fad gadget and all this,"
01:04:24;01:04:28;"you know, like, but the first time, you know,"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"I was up in my running and up in my running, up in my running."
01:04:31;01:04:34;"First went Modest Mouse, we got them for REM."
01:04:34;01:04:38;"It was the first time I'd ever run like 10 or 12 miles or whatever before a show."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"I thought, this is great."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"I walked out on stage."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"It's like I was vibrating."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"I got about halfway through the third song and I was like,"
01:04:44;01:04:47;"I ain't going to make it to this, the end of the show."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"I'm f***ed."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Oh damn."
01:04:49;01:04:50;"Too much running?"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"But then fast forward a couple of years, man,"
01:04:53;01:05:00;"I was running in the snow in the gig traffic against the traffic in like,"
01:05:00;01:05:04;"Minneapolis, that's Catoon and a lot like, oh yeah."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Oh yeah."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"Like if there's nowhere to go in these arenas,"
01:05:08;01:05:13;"I just run right around the area of the arena in piles of snow,"
01:05:13;01:05:17;"just with the traffic coming towards me, just, I was crazed."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"It was amazing."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Wow."
01:05:19;01:05:23;"And you felt so good physically, mentally."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Yeah."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"It was amazing."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"Is there a spiritual aspect to running long distances?"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"I think so, yeah."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Because it just takes you out of your head."
01:05:31;01:05:35;"It depends what you believe is the alternative to being in your head."
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Interesting."
01:05:36;01:05:40;"I've heard this, never experienced it, but maybe one day."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"I like to think about people stuck in traffic,"
01:05:42;01:05:46;"getting into the arena and they're just like, was that Johnny Marr?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"I don't know."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Some dude just ran by the car."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"In like a shorts and a t-shirt."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Right."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"Well, I used to run, when I used to run around Portland,"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"I was like, okay, depending on time of day,"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"I'd have this stupid stripy beanie on, okay."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"And I was like, oh, I'm all cool."
01:06:00;01:06:03;"And Isaac just said to me, he said, you know,"
01:06:03;01:06:06;"people just keep telling me that they keep seeing you with a stupid hat on."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"I was like, okay."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"So you switched it out?"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"No, I made it a thing."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Oh, that was your thing."
01:06:17;01:06:38;"Leave school for poetry I say goodbye to them and me"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"Velocity"
01:06:40;01:06:47;"It made me just run faster now"
01:06:47;01:06:57;"I'm gonna take it all, and drive around"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"Gonna cut my mind with the windows down"
01:07:00;01:07:06;"I miss a bit alright, I know"
01:07:06;01:07:13;"I got to live it out, oh oh"
01:07:13;01:07:20;"I can't resist, let force you, oh no"
01:07:20;01:07:26;"It turned out like I said it would"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"Can I get the world right here?"
01:07:29;01:07:32;"'Cause there are two symphonies"
01:07:32;01:07:37;"Okay, this is just another question I had when you're talking about touring with REM."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"Are you and Peter Buck boys? Do you have a relationship?"
01:07:40;01:07:47;"'Cause I always felt this thing like in the 80s, REM and The Smiths seemed to have so much in common,"
01:07:47;01:07:51;"and you guys as guitarists, did you have a connection in that era?"
01:07:51;01:07:58;"Not in that era, although they came to a show, I think it was New York or something, and we didn't get to meet up."
01:07:58;01:08:03;"I think I got stoned and forgot or something, that's quite likely, right?"
01:08:03;01:08:10;"But really we obviously super respected them, and then I guess sometime in the late 90s or mid 90s,"
01:08:10;01:08:15;"I went to see Peter play with Robin Hitchcock, and I think we maybe even said,"
01:08:15;01:08:20;"""Why aren't we buds?"" You know, like, this is, shouldn't we be like pals?"
01:08:20;01:08:25;"And do you know what was amazing? This was the really early days of iPods,"
01:08:25;01:08:32;"and they were a luxury item back then. He gave me an iPod, completely filled with music that he thought"
01:08:32;01:08:39;"I would not have heard, and that I would like, and it was such a cool gift. It was so great."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"And he was right, it was music that you hadn't heard and you did like."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"Yeah, nearly entirely."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"Do you remember what kind of stuff? Anything that jumps out to you from that?"
01:08:47;01:08:52;"Well, you know, it was a lot of kind of like, because believe it or not, I had a real blind spot for like,"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Alex Chilton and stuff like that. And he turned me on to a lot of that."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"There was a lot of good country stuff. There was a lot of Hank Williams."
01:08:58;01:09:03;"There was a lot of garage, psychedelic stuff that you would expect, really."
01:09:03;01:09:08;"I think Townes Van Zandt was, God, I love country, just realised. I think Townes Van Zandt was on."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"Yeah, you should check out The Grateful Dead."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Yeah, I don't think."
01:09:12;01:09:15;"No, Townes Van Zandt, amazing. Absolutely."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"I think it was a little bit like the Nas were on there. He turned me on to that."
01:09:18;01:09:24;"But, I think Peter then, he then moved to Portland when I was there."
01:09:24;01:09:30;"So we hung out a bit and that was before, and then Modest Mouse weren't on a tour then with REM."
01:09:30;01:09:34;"And then the answer is, of course, we get along. We're f***ing now."
01:09:34;01:09:40;"We've got so much in common. And the first show that we were playing that Modest Mouse played on that,"
01:09:40;01:09:46;"I think it was called Accelerator or whatever their album was then, 2000 and I don't know, '89."
01:09:46;01:09:52;"He came into the dressing room, say hello. And he happened to have the setlist in his hand, REM setlist,"
01:09:52;01:09:58;"and a Sharpie and he was talking to me and I just grabbed the Sharpie out of his hand and grabbed the setlist"
01:09:58;01:10:05;"and I wrote Fall On Me in the encore. And he said, if you play it. So I was kind of like, sure."
01:10:05;01:10:11;"Sure, okay, I've got this. Okay. So each night I'll play Fall On Me and then that added,"
01:10:11;01:10:17;"then something else added then we got like maybe Man and the Moon or a couple of other songs."
01:10:17;01:10:23;"So I would play that in the encore with him and that was great. The two of us playing Rickenbackers. Cool cat."
01:10:23;01:10:28;"Oh, wow. I got to look that up. There must be some some videos or audio of those shows."
01:10:28;01:10:36;"There's a problem that there's iron, bargain buildings, weights and pulleys,"
01:10:36;01:10:44;"feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air."
01:10:44;01:11:06;"By the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky. Fall On Me. Fall On Me. Fall On Me."
01:11:06;01:11:10;"What are you doing the rest of the year? Are you going on tour now?"
01:11:10;01:11:18;"We're about to go on tour with Blondie doing an arena tour in the UK, which is going to be cool,"
01:11:18;01:11:25;"because I wrote a song on their last record for them. That was really cool to be asked to come up with a song for them."
01:11:25;01:11:30;"And then I believe that just finishing off a new record that may or may not have one of my songs on."
01:11:30;01:11:35;"So that's really gratifying. And we're doing that."
01:11:35;01:11:40;"And then we're doing some other gigs in around Europe in the summer."
01:11:40;01:11:46;"Paris and whatever, some gigs in Germany and then and Milan."
01:11:46;01:11:51;"And then we're going out around stadiums with the Killers in September and October."
01:11:51;01:11:54;"In Europe? No, that's around the States. That's all over the place."
01:11:54;01:11:57;"Oh, awesome. That's like 30 shows. Yeah. Which will be fun."
01:11:57;01:12:01;"Are you guys coming to L.A.? Believe it or not, I don't think we are."
01:12:01;01:12:06;"I don't think I'm doing the L.A. shows for some reason. That's a strange thing. We're doing lots of other places."
01:12:06;01:12:11;"I'm like, even back in the Smiths days, right, I get on the tour bus."
01:12:11;01:12:15;"I would not know where I would not want to know where I was going."
01:12:15;01:12:22;"Now I'm definitely grown up and I don't know where I'm going. And I don't care."
01:12:22;01:12:27;"No, I feel you just like at a certain point, like just stay focused on the show."
01:12:27;01:12:32;"Hang around the venue, try to go to art museum, try some artisanal coffee."
01:12:32;01:12:36;"It's just going to stress you out. Just like, just stay there."
01:12:36;01:12:44;"As long as the shows are great and I can hopefully maybe get a run in and there's no dramas, my band are all happy."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"I really love that thing. I'm sure this won't be lost on you."
01:12:48;01:12:53;"That is one of the greatest things when you know when you're on the road and you don't know what day it is."
01:12:53;01:12:59;"And you often know what month it is and you don't know what town you're in."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"To me, it's like, what a job. That's amazing."
01:13:03;01:13:08;"Yeah, I like that you frame that positively because you definitely hear the other school of thought where people are just like,"
01:13:08;01:13:12;"I don't even know where I was. I was losing it. But I think you're right."
01:13:12;01:13:16;"It can be a positive thing. It's like you're connecting with the eternal."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Doesn't matter where you are."
01:13:18;01:13:24;"Oh, it's a, oh, hey, when people say that, I'm like, hey, listen, mate, buddy, soon enough,"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"you're going to know it's a wet Wednesday in Liverpool. Don't worry about it."
01:13:28;01:13:33;"That orientation, it will come back."
01:13:33;01:13:38;"Don't you enjoy that. You know what month it is. You don't know what day of the week it is."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"That's pretty cool. I love that. Yeah."
01:13:41;01:13:45;"The first time that happened, whenever it happens, I'm like, this is great, man."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"How did I get to do this? Really cool."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"That's a great way to frame it. Well, I think that's a great note to end on."
01:13:51;01:13:56;"It's been amazing talking to you. You essentially have two new albums, which everybody should check out."
01:13:56;01:13:59;"How do you frame it as two albums or one?"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"It's one double album called Fever Dreams."
01:14:02;01:14:03;"One double album."
01:14:03;01:14:08;"Yeah, it's called Fever Dreams Parts 1 to 4. And what happened was I just really like,"
01:14:08;01:14:13;"I had the title before I wrote one song, right? Or maybe I had a couple of songs in the go."
01:14:13;01:14:17;"And I was just like, Fever Dreams Parts 1 to 4 is like a nice title."
01:14:17;01:14:21;"And I didn't want to just call it Fever Dreams. And then I was like, well, what's this 1 to 4 about?"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"You better kind of work something out about that."
01:14:23;01:14:29;"So I came up with this. It's great. Artistic lateral thinking, which you guys will know about."
01:14:29;01:14:33;"It created a, gave me a conundrum, a creative conundrum. So what is that?"
01:14:33;01:14:39;"So I then was like, well, if the label are cool with it, this Parts 1 to 4,"
01:14:39;01:14:43;"the album is a double album, but I'll release the first few parts leading up to it."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"And then the album can be, then it can be this four part thing."
01:14:46;01:14:52;"And of course the label thought I was this marketing genius coming up with this concept."
01:14:52;01:14:56;"And it was just simply because I didn't want to lose the Parts 1 to 4 bit of the album."
01:14:56;01:15:01;"And, but also it gave me a, then it gave me a sort of thing where these whiteboards and I was like,"
01:15:01;01:15:05;"oh, that can be part one. And that song, oh, I've got two that are a little light there."
01:15:05;01:15:12;"I'll move that and lyrically that'll be good. And it's just a really fun kind of artistic kind of premise, really."
01:15:12;01:15:17;"That just came out of something quite abstract. So yeah, but it is a double album."
01:15:17;01:15:23;"I mean, that's because I went into it knowing because of the title, I was like, well, that sounds like a double album."
01:15:23;01:15:28;"Then I realized that I've never been in a band that I've ever done a double album, a proper double album before."
01:15:28;01:15:32;"And then it made me think, oh, double album, maybe some intros can be kind of long"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"and maybe I can put a few solos on there and gave me this feeling of being expansive."
01:15:37;01:15:41;"And you know, the way your mind works on this sort of stuff, because up until now,"
01:15:41;01:15:47;"I've been pretty hell bent on making the first three records really kind of kicking and super talented"
01:15:47;01:15:52;"and sort of like a kind of, I don't know what you call it, art rock kind of thing."
01:15:52;01:15:55;"But this, this is a bit more kind of open."
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Absolutely. I love that, that way of thinking."
01:15:58;01:16:03;"And also to have that concept and then meet the concept, figure out how you can work within it."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"Well, yeah. Amazing talking to you."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"Thank you."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"You're an awesome dude, awesome musician."
01:16:08;01:16:13;"Everybody check out Fever Dreams, one through four, see Johnny Marr on tour"
01:16:13;01:16:17;"and check out the movie Colors if you've never seen it, at least the opening scene."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"Thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it. It's an unusual cast."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"No, well, yeah, we hope you'll come back. Love to talk to you again."
01:16:23;01:16:32;"And I truly might try to reach out to Herbie Hancock. I would love to hear some of the extended jams from the Colors soundtrack."
01:16:32;01:16:38;"That sounds incredible. And we are going to make a little playlist for you of non-country Grateful Dead."
01:16:38;01:16:41;"And listen, if you don't like it, just don't even write back."
01:16:41;01:16:45;"I really think there's moments of Jerry's playing that you might connect with."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Sure."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"We're going to send it on an old iPod."
01:16:48;01:16:56;"That sounds perfect. Thanks, Gellert. You're in the UK, man. Lock me up."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"Oh, absolutely. I'd love to. Thanks so much. Thanks for coming on, Johnny."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"All right. We'll talk to you soon."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Thank you, Johnny."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"Guys, take care."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"Bye."
01:17:05;01:17:13;"Talking with my shadow, escape the sensory."
01:17:13;01:17:21;"Some other day, tomorrow, tomorrow endlessly."
01:17:21;01:17:30;"Switching through my channel, I'm a real machine."
01:17:30;01:17:55;"Calling me to follow a detour memory."
01:17:55;01:18:03;"Climbing through the static, just how I need to be."
01:18:03;01:18:11;"Future days, tomorrow, call my history."
01:18:11;01:18:19;"Look through every window, walk through any door."
01:18:19;01:18:26;"Now don't you know I never saw the world so clear before."
01:18:26;01:18:43;"In these days, life is a perfect start."
01:18:43;01:18:58;"In these days, holding on for so long."
01:18:58;01:19:26;"Thinking with my shadow, I heard it calling me."
01:19:26;01:19:34;"We will find tomorrow, somewhere where we can be."
01:19:34;01:19:42;"Walking through the static, dreaming endlessly."
01:19:42;01:19:49;"Another way tomorrow, believing sensory."
01:19:49;01:20:05;"In these days, life is a perfect start."
01:20:05;01:20:22;"In these days, holding on for so long."
01:20:22;01:20:39;"In these days."
01:20:39;01:20:47;"In these days."
01:20:47;01:21:13;"In these days."
01:21:13;01:21:17;"Thank you to Johnny Marr. That's, I think that's one of the best guests we ever had."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"I mean, yeah, I try to keep it in check. I'm such a fan."
01:21:21;01:21:24;"I'm gonna go back and listen to all of his work again."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"I loved how guitar intensive the convo was."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"I don't know how many guitarists we've had on this show."
01:21:30;01:21:34;"And I always say like, oh, I don't really care about guitars that much or gear."
01:21:34;01:21:37;"But truly, if you had asked me like years ago,"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"who's a guitarist you'd like to talk to and what question would you ask them?"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"I really would have said, I'd like to talk to Johnny Marr."
01:21:44;01:21:48;"And I want to know exactly what he was listening to when he was like 18, 19."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And wrote this charming man specifically."
01:21:50;01:21:54;"Because it really, there wouldn't be a punk without this charming man."
01:21:54;01:21:57;"Like I learned it's like, dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:21:57;01:22:01;"And then I was like, dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"I've never thought of the vampire Johnny Marr connection."
01:22:04;01:22:07;"But now that you mentioned it, it's, it's fully there."
01:22:07;01:22:12;"And I've never done, and we've never done at least so far in our careers,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"a lot of what I think people associate with him,"
01:22:14;01:22:18;"which is his kind of like arpeggiated dung like stuff."
01:22:18;01:22:24;"But he does, he has those moments up on the high strings of that kind of like movement."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"That, yeah, I mean, I love him."
01:22:27;01:22:32;"And then we didn't even get into like, how soon is now probably one of the most iconic,"
01:22:32;01:22:37;"fascinating, weird guitar sounds that nobody knows how to recreate."
01:22:37;01:22:43;"Although now you can find like deep analyses of like how they did the dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"Yeah, he's a dude who can kind of do anything."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"Anyway, thank you to Johnny Marr."
01:22:49;01:22:55;"Before we get into the top five, we have a little bit of a food business to take care of."
01:22:55;01:22:58;"We should have kept Johnny Marr on the phone because I could have asked him about this."
01:22:58;01:23:04;"We have a new product in our possession from the Goldfish brand."
01:23:04;01:23:08;"Now Goldfish, we haven't talked about Goldfish in a long time on TC."
01:23:08;01:23:10;"We're now joined by Seinfeld."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"Hey, what's up?"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"He missed the first half of the show because he was actually,"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"he was hanging out with his friend Morrissey,"
01:23:17;01:23:20;"and he couldn't come through for the Johnny Marr interview."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"Not allowed to talk about Johnny Marr."
01:23:23;01:23:25;"He was in great spirits, by the way. He's doing great."
01:23:25;01:23:30;"He's got a whole new lease on life."
01:23:30;01:23:32;"So we used to talk about Goldfish on the show."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"We did the Goldfish challenge."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Would you remind everyone?"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"Actually, Seinfeld, what is the Goldfish challenge?"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"It's like it's about hummus."
01:23:39;01:23:43;"Yeah, so actually it's timely because the Super Bowl is coming up with."
01:23:43;01:23:44;"Oh, perfect."
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Yeah, Dr. Dre."
01:23:45;01:23:50;"The idea of the Goldfish and hummus challenge was that at your next Super Bowl party,"
01:23:50;01:23:56;"leave out a dish of Goldfish and a bowl of hummus to dip it in and don't acknowledge it."
01:23:56;01:23:58;"And just see, it's like a social experiment."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"See what happens at the party."
01:24:00;01:24:05;"And it's really interesting because the whole premise of this psychological experiment,"
01:24:05;01:24:07;"the Goldfish challenge,"
01:24:07;01:24:12;"which we developed with some really high level clinical psychologists at Harvard."
01:24:12;01:24:16;"One of them was also at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"But the reason we developed this is because what was interesting about it"
01:24:19;01:24:24;"is the Goldfish is a little bit too small to properly scoop a dip with."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"It's not impossible, but it's a little bit too small."
01:24:27;01:24:32;"And you learn a lot about human nature based on whether or not people will say anything"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"or whether they'll get annoyed by getting some of the dip on their fingers."
01:24:35;01:24:39;"But I guess a lot of our work is kind of less relevant these days"
01:24:39;01:24:44;"because Goldfish have introduced a new product called Megabytes."
01:24:44;01:24:48;"And Megabytes, it's also interesting because I think we first started talking about"
01:24:48;01:24:51;"Goldfish because we said, ""Are Goldfish for children?"""
01:24:51;01:24:55;"And my take was that Goldfish clearly had become a children's snack."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Although I looked it up recently."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Maybe we talked about this back in the day."
01:24:59;01:25:02;"When Goldfish first came out, I think in the 60s,"
01:25:02;01:25:07;"they were framed as a kind of sophisticated adult snack to have at cocktail parties."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"But over the years, they became a children's snack."
01:25:10;01:25:15;"And now Goldfish is introducing Goldfish Megabytes, which are larger,"
01:25:15;01:25:21;"so much easier to dip. And they're also more sophisticated flavors for more of a grown-up palette."
01:25:21;01:25:27;"You know, people in the 70 plus crowd, people who are unambiguously older."
01:25:27;01:25:31;"And the two flavors they've unleashed on the world so far are"
01:25:31;01:25:34;"sharp cheddar and cheddar jalapeno."
01:25:34;01:25:37;"Yeah, you're not going to find a lot of five-year-olds asking their parents"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"for sharp cheddar and cheddar jalapeno."
01:25:39;01:25:43;"We were going to talk about this on the last show,"
01:25:43;01:25:48;"but everybody's Goldfish Megabytes arrived just after we taped the last show."
01:25:48;01:25:54;"So it put the whole Crisis crew in a real crisis in that we received the Megabytes"
01:25:54;01:25:58;"and we had just about two weeks we had to wait to eat them on air."
01:25:58;01:26:02;"And there was a lot of discussion on the group chat about how waiting to eat these Goldfish"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"was friggin' torture."
01:26:04;01:26:07;"Because normally somebody sends a great snack to your house,"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"first thing you want to do is eat it."
01:26:08;01:26:14;"It's a very unusual situation that you have to wait two weeks before you can even touch it."
01:26:14;01:26:17;"And I know for all of us, we've been so excited to try this snack"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"and it was friggin' torture not to be able to eat it."
01:26:20;01:26:23;"So, I mean, I put mine way in the back of the pantry."
01:26:23;01:26:27;"And of course, I didn't want my family to see it because I think if any member of my family saw it,"
01:26:27;01:26:31;"they'd be gone. And I'd have to explain, ""No guys, this is for my work."""
01:26:31;01:26:34;"I had to put mine on the top shelf so my son couldn't reach it."
01:26:34;01:26:37;"Because these are for adults."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"It would also just be inappropriate for a child to..."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"It's a big boy snack."
01:26:41;01:26:43;"I want to say about..."
01:26:43;01:26:47;"And I don't want to put this off any longer because I'm hungry and I'm desperate to eat these."
01:26:47;01:26:53;"But Pepperidge Farm claims that 40% of Goldfish are eaten by adults."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"Like this is..."
01:26:54;01:26:55;"Wait, really?"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"Yes."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"I didn't know that."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"I don't know."
01:26:58;01:27:05;"And the CMO of Campbell Snacks, the parent company to Pepperidge Farm said,"
01:27:05;01:27:12;"""This is the first time Goldfish has created a snacking experience specifically with grown-up tastes in mind."""
01:27:12;01:27:16;"So, it does feel like at some level they are recognizing it's a child snack."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"I thought originally they were for adults."
01:27:19;01:27:22;"Well, yeah, clearly it's become a child snack."
01:27:22;01:27:28;"Also, like imagining like a Goldfish-obsessed household where at all times you have to have both"
01:27:28;01:27:31;"traditional Goldfish for the children and then Megabytes for the grown-ups."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"And the twain shall never meet."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"That'd be a cool Super Bowl party."
01:27:35;01:27:39;"Just like invite some families over and just be like,"
01:27:39;01:27:43;"""Alright, now these ones are for the kids only and for the grown-ups don't worry, I got you."""
01:27:43;01:27:46;"And bring out the bowl of Megabytes, the cheddar jalapeno."
01:27:46;01:27:51;"Alright, well let's get into it because we've been torturing ourselves long enough."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"Gentlemen."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"Can I just say that they have this..."
01:27:56;01:28:01;"Does this happen on all Goldfish packages with this classy Goldfish sticker?"
01:28:01;01:28:06;"No, it's got a cool little... That looks like something you'd get at like a hipster coffee shop."
01:28:06;01:28:10;"So already the adult sort of focused marketing is in full effect here."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Okay."
01:28:12;01:28:19;"Did they make the individual Goldfish bigger for like scooping purposes?"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"They're like twice as big."
01:28:21;01:28:25;"Honestly, the fact that the Goldfish is bigger makes it more childish to me."
01:28:25;01:28:30;"This looks like even more of like a big goofy kid snack, big fish."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"I just grabbed a ruler. I want to measure these."
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Oh yeah, what are the..."
01:28:35;01:28:38;"Wait, are you doing sharp cheddar or the jalapeno?"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"I'm doing the jalapeno."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"I did jalapeno."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"These are clocking in at an inch and a quarter."
01:28:44;01:28:47;"I want to say... I don't remember the last time I had..."
01:28:47;01:28:54;"I mean it has to be fairly recently, but the sharp cheddar tastes exactly like normal Goldfish."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"I couldn't tell you the difference."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"Cheddar jalapeno has a bit of a kick."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"Oh, okay. The jalapeno has a little bit."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"It has a little bit of a kick."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"It lingers."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"Yep, that's a big boy snack."
01:29:06;01:29:08;"That's a big boy snack."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"I'd love to crush these with a beer."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I would dip these in some hummus."
01:29:13;01:29:16;"Oh yeah, I agree. Sharp cheddar tastes exactly like regular Goldfish."
01:29:16;01:29:19;"I'm feeling these cheddar jalapenos. These are good."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"An amazing climax to a two-week story."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Would you buy these a regular Goldfish?"
01:29:23;01:29:26;"I mean, honestly, I'm not buying either."
01:29:26;01:29:30;"I mean, I guess if I was having a Super Bowl party,"
01:29:30;01:29:35;"and maybe I will have a Super Bowl party because I have a great snack to share,"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I would buy these over it."
01:29:37;01:29:40;"And I would say, ""Okay, the kids probably shouldn't have the cheddar jalapeno."
01:29:40;01:29:46;"It's got a bit of a kick, but the sharp cheddar, the adults and the kids can both enjoy."""
01:29:46;01:29:51;"I like the idea of you having a Super Bowl party solely to show off your snack."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"People definitely do that."
01:29:53;01:29:58;"I do miss, and again, I only would eat Goldfish at a kid's party,"
01:29:58;01:30:03;"but there's something about the handful of the small Goldfish"
01:30:03;01:30:08;"that's more rewarding, that's almost more satisfying than these."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"No. I'm a convert."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"You don't agree? You don't agree?"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Counterpoint. No."
01:30:15;01:30:20;"I got to call out the, these are actually not unhealthy."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"They're healthier than one would think."
01:30:23;01:30:27;"No sugar, relatively low fat, high sodium, but not that bad."
01:30:27;01:30:31;"22 pieces a serving. Healthier than you'd expect."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Eating 22 of these feels like a lot."
01:30:33;01:30:39;"Right? And yet if you ate 22 of these, you'd be getting 3 grams of protein"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"and only 9% of your daily fat intake."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Not bad."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"Do you know where Pepperidge Farm, Inc. is based?"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"Norwalk, Connecticut."
01:30:50;01:30:53;"Connecticut's pulling its weight in the snack game."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"Alright, let's get into the top 5."
01:30:55;01:31:02;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:31:02;01:31:05;"This week, we're going to bang this out."
01:31:05;01:31:09;"We're just doing 2003. Why 2003?"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"I have a feeling, I'm not totally sure."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Great question. I don't know."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"Is that the year Johnny Marr moved to Portland?"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"Maybe it is. It's the year I left Portland."
01:31:17;01:31:20;"I think Johnny and I had a 6 month crossover in Portland."
01:31:20;01:31:22;"Did you ever spot him?"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"No, I don't think I would have recognized him."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Especially in his beanie."
01:31:26;01:31:30;"2003 is the year that Johnny released his first solo album."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"Interesting. So was that the same time he was playing in Modest Mouse?"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Or was he done with Modest Mouse by then?"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"No, I think Modest Mouse was after that."
01:31:38;01:31:44;"I saw Modest Mouse play a lot in, I don't know, '99, 2000."
01:31:44;01:31:48;"It was like a trio or a four piece. I forget."
01:31:48;01:31:53;"Great live band. I'm really curious now to look up YouTubes of that later period Modest Mouse."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"It sounds like there were like 8 people in it."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"Yeah, I'd love to hear some of that."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"I think the Modest Mouse stuff was like mid-decade."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"Okay, so yeah, this was his first solo album."
01:32:02;01:32:05;"Maybe a year or two before he moved to Portland."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"Okay, the number 5 song this week in 2003."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"Justin Timberlake, ""Cry Me a River""."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"Big hit."
01:32:14;01:32:21;"Produced by Timbaland and Scott Storch."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"This was off his first solo record, right?"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"Yeah, Justified. Huge album."
01:32:26;01:32:37;"Wasn't a lot of Justified written for Michael Jackson who passed on it?"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Yeah, that sounds kind of familiar."
01:32:39;01:32:45;"I think the first single was an MJ/Pharrell joint that was passed on."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Right, maybe some of the Neptune stuff."
01:32:47;01:32:51;"Well, this song is famously about Justin Timberlake,"
01:32:51;01:32:55;"or he certainly implied that Britney Spears had cheated on him."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"Damn, who knows if that's true."
01:33:05;01:33:09;"It is possible that Timberlake was cooking up a song for Michael Jackson"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"about Britney Spears cheating on him."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"And maybe Michael Jackson said, ""I don't connect to this."
01:33:14;01:33:17;"This says nothing to me about my life."""
01:33:17;01:33:20;"Maybe Justin Timberlake might see himself in it."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"And Timberlake said, ""That's a good idea."""
01:33:22;01:33:29;"Wait, pause it."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"I'm just wailing on these cheddar jalapeno megabytes over here."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"Yeah, sorry Justin Timberlake."
01:33:34;01:33:37;"We're not probably going to give our all and listen to the music"
01:33:37;01:33:41;"because all of us are just in--we're all in frigging heaven right now."
01:33:41;01:33:45;"Just crushing these cheddar jalapeno megabyte goldfish."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"Megabyte. Huge state."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"You know, the megabytes showing up right after we finished taping last episode"
01:33:51;01:33:54;"and then having them sit around was actually a PSYOP."
01:33:54;01:33:56;"Was actually a CIA PSYOP."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Operation Big and Crispy."
01:33:58;01:34:03;"Just to get us so hyped that by the time we ate them,"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"this is the greatest snack ever."
01:34:05;01:34:08;"Yeah, I mean it was a study in human restraint,"
01:34:08;01:34:11;"which we all pass with flying colors."
01:34:11;01:34:15;"If you went to a party and these were in the bowl, Super Bowl party,"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"and no one had mentioned anything,"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"would it have occurred to you these were bigger?"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"Oh yeah."
01:34:21;01:34:23;"You would have noted it."
01:34:23;01:34:25;"They're also flatter."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"The original goldfish are slightly more bulbous."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"This is more of just like a thinner cracker."
01:34:31;01:34:34;"I mean, it's obviously a different shape, but it's a good--"
01:34:34;01:34:37;"I mean, I guess this is this year's Super Bowl challenge."
01:34:37;01:34:40;"Go buy some cheddar jalapeno megabytes, put them in a bowl,"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"and see if anybody says anything."
01:34:42;01:34:46;"Because on the one hand, if you went up to somebody and you said--"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"and you showed them a megabyte and an old goldfish,"
01:34:49;01:34:52;"and you said, ""Which of these is the more familiar goldfish?"""
01:34:52;01:34:56;"Of course they would say, ""It's this one. This other one's kind of big and flat."""
01:34:56;01:34:58;"But it is a good question."
01:34:58;01:35:01;"You have to find out which ones of your friends are true snack heads"
01:35:01;01:35:03;"or who are interested in corporate food history."
01:35:03;01:35:06;"If you poured a bowl of these and you just put them out"
01:35:06;01:35:10;"and you invite like 8 to 10 people, some people would note--"
01:35:10;01:35:13;"might clock it, but would anybody actually say to you,"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"""Hey, I couldn't help but notice the goldfish you put out"
01:35:16;01:35:20;"were big and crispy, flat, and had a bit of a kick."
01:35:20;01:35:21;"What's the story?"""
01:35:21;01:35:25;"I would just be immediately like, ""What's the story with these goldfish?"""
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Whoa! What's going on?"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"What the f*ck is going on with these goldfish?"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"Can I talk to you?"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"Hey, come here for a second."
01:35:34;01:35:36;"Whoa! Wait, wait, turn off the game. Turn off the game."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"Everybody, come here."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"What's going on?"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"What the f*ck?"

01:35:44;01:35:46;"Everybody clear the room."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"I need to talk to the host."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"I need the room."
01:35:49;01:35:52;"I could just picture so many people just eating handfuls of them"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"and just not giving a sh*t, and then you as the host go up to them"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"and be like, ""You notice anything different about those goldfish?"""
01:35:57;01:35:59;"And they'd be like, ""No."""
01:35:59;01:36:02;"And be like, ""They're cheddar jalapeno megabytes."""

01:36:06;01:36:09;"Okay, that's cool. I'm trying to watch the game."
01:36:09;01:36:12;"They also come in sharp cheddar. Pretty cool, huh?"""
01:36:12;01:36:15;"It's right in the middle of Eminem's performance."
01:36:15;01:36:17;"Yeah, I really--"
01:36:17;01:36:22;"There could almost be this feeling of a Mandela effect or something."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"You know, just like you went and you were eating--"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"It's almost like you were having a stroke."
01:36:25;01:36:27;"You're like, ""Something's just not--"

01:36:30;01:36:33;"Not being able to pinpoint it. You know what I mean?"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"That's also a cool Super Bowl challenge."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Just put them out, and if anybody does say anything,"
01:36:37;01:36:40;"you say, ""These are bog-standard goldfish."""
01:36:40;01:36:42;"What are you talking about?"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"I bought these in bulk."
01:36:44;01:36:49;"I've been buying the same giant thing of them from Sam's Club for 30 years."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"And they got a bit of a kick and said, ""Maybe your palate's changing."
01:36:52;01:36:54;"Did you have COVID?"""
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Yeah, I did have COVID."
01:36:55;01:36:58;"This is like a gentle jester kind of--"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Oh, yeah. This is a very gentle jester type joke."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"What if you did something a little extra"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"where you played with the proportions?"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"Like, if you normally have a 46-inch TV,"
01:37:06;01:37:09;"get a 42-inch TV, get a little bit bigger chair,"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"get a smaller coffee table."
01:37:11;01:37:14;"You may find everything. It's the Megabyte Challenge."
01:37:14;01:37:18;"Side note, I looked up the average size of real goldfish,"
01:37:18;01:37:21;"and they're on average 1 to 2 inches long."
01:37:21;01:37:24;"So what you're eating there is pretty proportionate to the size of--"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"All right."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Regular goldfish are 1 to 2 inches long?"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"No, no, like the animal."
01:37:31;01:37:34;"-Oh, sorry. -The beast of the sea."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"-Got you. -The real goldfish."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"The beast of the bowl."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Yeah, the gold-- Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"So you're eating something pretty proportionate to, like,"
01:37:42;01:37:44;"the size of a real goldfish."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"-Take that for what it's worth. -Or of a baby goldfish."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"Sure, if they're up to 2 inches, sure."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"Yeah, an adolescent goldfish."
01:37:51;01:37:54;"Speaking of baby goldfish, there are baby goldfish."
01:37:54;01:37:57;"-Oh, that are even smaller? -That are even smaller."
01:37:57;01:38:00;"-I mean, how-- -Wait, are you talking about pepperidge?"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"-Pepperidge farms. -That are actually for babies?"
01:38:02;01:38:05;"I guess, but babies can't eat goldfish."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"-But they're, like, tiny? -No matter what the size."
01:38:07;01:38:10;"It's not baby food. It's just a tinier cragger."
01:38:10;01:38:13;"-And they're called baby goldfish? -Yes, they're called baby goldfish."
01:38:13;01:38:14;"How about this?"
01:38:14;01:38:17;"You pour a bunch of megabytes into the bowl at the Super Bowl party,"

01:52:47;01:52:49;"- Okay, here's what I, my guess,"
01:52:49;01:52:53;"the intent is that, you know, in LL famously,"
01:52:53;01:52:57;"he's like this pretty boy, like lover man character,"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"perhaps in real life too, you know,"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"in a lot of his early work,"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"where I think a lot of the songs he's like kind of,"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"you know, essentially like hitting on people, kicking games."
01:53:06;01:53:08;"So I think probably in his mind,"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"he's probably imagining that he was talking to"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"a woman who was like too proud"
01:53:13;01:53:15;"to like give him the time of day."
01:53:15;01:53:17;"So I think in his mind, he's probably, you know,"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"it's like that she was so proud, you know,"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"'cause like people can describe somebody"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"as being like proud, like haughty,"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"like proud in like a negative way."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"And that there's a big difference"
01:53:27;01:53:29;"between the word proud and pride."
01:53:29;01:53:31;"Like for instance, you know, back in the day,"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"people would describe you like,"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"""Look at them walking around all proud,"""
01:53:34;01:53:36;"almost meaning like they're full of themselves."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"Whereas if you said, ""Look at them walking around"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"with a sense of pride,"""
01:53:40;01:53:42;"it just doesn't hit the same way."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Maybe because of like, you know,"
01:53:44;01:53:45;"the gay pride movement"
01:53:45;01:53:48;"or the civil rights movements, black pride,"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"the word pride has come to mean"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"more just like basic human dignity."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"But you know, there is the older version of proud."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"""Oh, look, so proud."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"Aren't you just so proud of yourself?"""
01:53:58;01:54:01;"So I think maybe LL is coming at it from that angle."
01:54:01;01:54:05;"Like, ""Oh, you used to be this very proud, haughty person"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"who wouldn't, you look down on me,"
01:54:07;01:54:08;"you wouldn't give me the time of day."

01:54:10;01:54:11;"But of course you're totally right."
