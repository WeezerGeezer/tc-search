00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, Sunday, March 12th."
00:04;00:07;"There's a lot to discuss."
00:07;00:11;"Jake made a Home Depot playlist, a dream playlist."
00:11;00:16;"Vin Diesel sang a Kygo and Selena Gomez song."
00:16;00:23;"All this, plus Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Dave Longstreth as our guest,"
00:23;00:28;"and the top five hits of 2017 and 1981."
00:28;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:33;00:38;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-beats 1."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:44;00:51;"The war I've felt, warmingly, all my rightful chances"
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go"
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:16;01:26;"I'm leaving only pain, staring at the ceiling"
01:26;01:33;"Wishing she was somewhere else in space"
01:33;01:42;"[beat]"
01:42;01:48;"How do you feel, is it loneliness?"
01:48;01:55;"Is there shining in your heart, but no gloss on your lips?"
01:55;02:01;"Do you sail alone, round the island with"
02:01;02:07;"A silhouette of a shark beneath my skin?"
02:07;02:12;"And then you say, wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
02:12;02:15;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
02:15;02:19;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
02:19;02:21;"The right one, the right one"
02:21;02:27;"[beat]"
02:27;02:36;"You've been waiting for your love in me"
02:36;02:40;"And there's been waters in deep"
02:40;02:46;"We've been hanging tight for all the things"
02:46;02:49;"That's what I've loved so way"
02:49;02:54;"But if only I was you"
02:54;02:57;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
03:00;03:04;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
03:04;03:07;"The right one, the right one"
03:07;03:10;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
03:13;03:17;"Wanna be where you are, you're the right one"
03:17;03:19;"The right one, the right one"
03:19;03:26;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
03:26;03:30;"Time Crisis, Sunday, March 12th, we're back."
03:30;03:32;"I'm here with Jake. What's up, Jake?"
03:32;03:33;"Hey."
03:33;03:34;"But this time we got a bonus."
03:34;03:37;"We got a bonus Longstreth in the building."
03:37;03:38;"Dave Longstreth. What's up, Dave?"
03:38;03:39;"What's up?"
03:39;03:41;"So, Dave, you've been on the show before."
03:41;03:42;"Yeah."
03:42;03:46;"Dave is the guy behind the group Dirty Projectors."
03:46;03:50;"Known him for a long time. He's also Jake's brother."
03:50;03:53;"Just dropped a new album, but we've known each other too long"
03:53;03:56;"for me to ask you questions about your new album."
03:56;03:59;"So we're just gonna talk about more like Time Crisis type stuff."
03:59;04:01;"Although it is out. Check it out."
04:01;04:05;"You can stream it on Apple Music and you can buy it on vinyl"
04:05;04:07;"at your local record store."
04:07;04:10;"Oh, yeah, I do. I do want to say the vinyl looks sick."
04:10;04:11;"Yeah. Oh, cool."
04:11;04:13;"Because you actually printed it on."
04:13;04:15;"It's like a gray cloudy vinyl."
04:15;04:19;"It's that stuff, duvetyne, that like weird black."
04:19;04:20;"Oh, yeah."
04:20;04:21;"Light absorbing fabric."
04:21;04:23;"People use it in like theater productions."
04:23;04:24;"Yeah, yeah."
04:24;04:28;"And then the things are like black plexiglass reflecting a ceiling."
04:28;04:29;"It looks really."
04:29;04:30;"It's not printed on duvetyne."
04:30;04:31;"No, no, no."
04:31;04:32;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
04:32;04:33;"I haven't seen it."
04:33;04:34;"Domino hasn't sent me one."
04:34;04:35;"I literally have."
04:35;04:37;"I've only seen pictures."
04:37;04:38;"Damn."
04:38;04:40;"I don't have a copy of the album."
04:40;04:42;"You got to pick one up, man."
04:42;04:44;"Swing by Amoeba."
04:44;04:45;"I know I should."
04:45;04:46;"Gimme, gimme."
04:46;04:49;"Mom and dad asked for one too, Jake."
04:49;04:50;"Hook 'em up."
04:50;04:52;"It's so funny when you're around siblings,"
04:52;04:55;"because your siblings are the only people you can talk about"
04:55;04:57;"your parents as mom and dad."
04:57;05:00;"In fact, it's really hilarious and a very weird character trait"
05:00;05:04;"when people say that to people who aren't their siblings."
05:04;05:07;"So, for instance, you guys together, you would say,"
05:07;05:09;"""Oh, by the way, mom said, dad said."""
05:09;05:12;"Or M, M and D."
05:12;05:13;"Wait, you call your parents M and D?"
05:13;05:14;"Yeah."
05:14;05:15;"Frequently."
05:15;05:16;"In text or in language?"
05:16;05:18;"Like verbal language."
05:18;05:20;"Mom and dad, this seems long."
05:20;05:23;"M and D is a little bit shorter."
05:23;05:25;"Wait, so you'll just be like."
05:25;05:29;"So M and D said they were going to come visit in mid-April."
05:29;05:30;"Yep."
05:30;05:32;"It's like not even a joke at this point."
05:32;05:35;"M said she wanted to definitely go check out the museum"
05:35;05:36;"while she was here,"
05:36;05:39;"while D said it'd be cool maybe to go down to Marina del Rey"
05:39;05:41;"and do some fishing."
05:41;05:43;"That's like an actual conversation?"
05:43;05:44;"M and D."
05:44;05:46;"It sounds like R and D."
08:55;08:59;"Well, so two weeks ago we did the show and it was Oscars day."
08:59;09:02;"So when you do a show every two weeks,"
09:02;09:05;"it's always kind of hard to know,"
09:05;09:08;"like should you cover stuff that happened in the past two weeks?"
09:08;09:10;"Like should we talk about the Oscars right now?"
09:10;09:12;"Right, because we did the Grammys recap,"
09:12;09:14;"which was great because you were there,"
09:14;09:17;"and so there were a lot of anecdotes to relay."
09:17;09:18;"Right."
09:18;09:23;"We probably have a lot of new, insightful things to say about the Grammys."
09:23;09:25;"Oh, he's still talking about the Grammys."
09:25;09:27;"That's funny, why don't we just keep talking about the Grammys"
09:27;09:28;"after all the award shows?"
09:28;09:29;"Oscars were cool."
09:29;09:32;"Oh yeah, well one thing I can say is I've met that guy,"
09:32;09:34;"the producer before."
09:34;09:35;"Which producer?"
09:35;09:38;"The producer who said, ""Stop, Moonlight, you won."""
09:38;09:39;"Oh, this is not a joke."
09:39;09:40;"This is not a joke."
09:40;09:44;"His wife, who he referred to as a blue-eyed wife."
09:44;09:45;"That was so strange."
09:45;09:48;"For anybody who didn't see or doesn't remember that part,"
09:48;09:50;"when the La La Land people thought they'd won"
09:50;09:51;"and they were giving their speeches,"
09:51;09:53;"which is the most brutal part of all of it,"
09:53;09:55;"is just like being like, ""Believe in your dreams,"""
09:55;09:57;"and then you find out it didn't happen."
09:57;10:00;"One of the producers referred to his blue-eyed wife."
10:00;10:03;"He said, ""I've got a great baby,"" and, you know,"
10:03;10:04;"""Julia, you're my blue-eyed--"""
10:04;10:05;"My beautiful blue-eyed wife."
10:05;10:07;"Well, anyway, his blue-eyed wife went to Columbia."
10:07;10:09;"She actually directed Rostam and I"
10:09;10:12;"in a production of Romeo and Juliet."
10:12;10:13;"Whoa."
10:13;10:16;"So we've got a connection to this whole fiasco."
10:16;10:18;"Wait, you guys both acted in a production?"
10:18;10:20;"We were like the bottom of the barrel,"
10:20;10:22;"like the dudes who had a couple lines."
10:22;10:23;"We were the night watchmen."
10:23;10:24;"You both were?"
10:24;10:25;"Yeah."
10:25;10:26;"Together?"
10:26;10:27;"Like a vampire."
10:27;10:28;"Yeah, this was like freshman year,"
10:28;10:29;"night watchmen number one and two,"
10:29;10:30;"maybe sophomore year."
10:30;10:31;"That's so awesome."
10:31;10:34;"But anyway, the director was Julia Hart,"
10:34;10:36;"who was the blue-eyed wife of the speech,"
10:36;10:42;"and then once I'd met him, I met that guy via her."
10:42;10:44;"He was casting a movie that was like about--"
10:44;10:47;"that involved like an indie band in Chicago,"
10:47;10:49;"like a struggling indie band in Chicago,"
10:49;10:50;"and like to his credit,"
10:50;10:55;"he was trying to cast real musicians to play the roles,"
10:55;10:58;"although this is one thing that I will say."
10:58;11:00;"I do believe in myself,"
11:00;11:03;"and I believe I could learn a lot of things,"
11:03;11:06;"but one thing that I just am not good at is acting."
11:06;11:07;"I feel the same."
11:07;11:08;"You know, we both come from music."
11:08;11:10;"There's so many things that, you know,"
11:10;11:14;"a musician's ear could translate into,"
11:14;11:15;"or like the way you put together an album"
11:15;11:18;"is not dissimilar from a lot of other art forms,"
11:18;11:19;"but acting, acting and singing,"
11:19;11:22;"I've always had this theory, actually."
11:22;11:24;"Rappers are good actors."
11:24;11:26;"Singers are terrible actors."
11:26;11:27;"And people are going to think,"
11:27;11:30;"""Am I trying to make like a racial point?"""
11:30;11:32;"No."
11:32;11:33;"You're not?"
11:33;11:37;"Obviously not, because this crosses racial lines."
11:37;11:40;"Eminem, white rapper, great actor."
11:40;11:43;"Crushed it, 8-mile."
11:43;11:47;"Mariah Carey, biracial singer."
11:47;11:48;"This is not my opinion,"
11:48;11:51;"but generally she was regarded as a poor actress,"
11:51;11:53;"although she was good and precious."
11:53;11:54;"But what's your theory?"
11:54;11:55;"Why?"
11:55;11:56;"Here's why I would guess."
11:56;11:57;"I've thought about it before."
11:57;11:58;"I think if you're good at rapping,"
11:58;12:00;"you're good at expressing yourself that way."
12:00;12:03;"You'll probably be good at conveying reality"
12:03;12:04;"via the dramatic arts,"
12:04;12:07;"whereas if you sing and you get--"
12:07;12:10;"the things that are valued in being a good singer"
12:10;12:12;"to me are like antithetical to being a good actor."
12:12;12:15;"Now, I'm thinking of great singers that were great actors."
12:15;12:16;"Like who?"
12:16;12:17;"Kris Kristofferson."
12:17;12:19;"Debatable."
12:19;12:21;"He was the lead in Heaven's Gate."
12:21;12:22;"Incredible film."
12:22;12:24;"Bombed, but incredible film."
12:24;12:26;"And then Frank Sinatra."
12:26;12:27;"Okay."
12:27;12:28;"Manchurian candidate."
12:28;12:29;"Frank Sinatra's like a weird one."
12:29;12:31;"But he's kind of like a rapper, right?"
12:31;12:32;"Mm-hmm."
12:32;12:33;"His vibe."
12:33;12:34;"In a way."
12:34;12:36;"I'm just trying to think, like--"
12:36;12:38;"I think."
12:38;12:40;"This is, again, not my opinion,"
12:40;12:43;"because as you know, I'm a huge Beyonce fan."
12:43;12:45;"She was robbed at the Grammys."
12:45;12:47;"However, for someone who's considered"
12:47;12:49;"one of the most talented people on planet Earth right now,"
12:49;12:53;"even many of her biggest supporters"
12:53;12:55;"don't consider her to be a great actress."
12:55;12:56;"Yeah."
12:56;12:57;"She's a good actress."
12:57;12:58;"She's not great."
12:58;13:01;"Whereas, like, Ice Cube is a great actor."
13:01;13:02;"Yeah, he does it."
13:02;13:05;"Eminem was a great actor in the one movie he ever was in."
13:05;13:08;"And there was one role that he was born to play."
13:08;13:10;"Rabbit."
13:10;13:11;"Himself."
13:11;13:12;"Himself, the character."

13:35;13:36;"Anyway, I don't know."
13:36;13:37;"Maybe this is a half-baked theory."
13:37;13:39;"I've just always thought that the rap community"
13:39;13:44;"has produced some very, very high-caliber actors."
13:44;13:47;"And the singing community has been--"
13:47;13:49;"And singers always want to try acting."
13:49;13:51;"It's classic, and they almost always fail."
13:51;13:52;"Yeah, and it goes the other way, too."
13:52;13:53;"Madonna, that's a classic one."
13:53;13:54;"Oh, yeah, she's terrible."
13:54;13:55;"They always--"
13:55;13:56;"And, you know, I think she gets a bad rap, too."
13:56;13:57;"Body of evidence, dude."
13:57;14:00;"People were always really hard on Madonna as an actress."
14:00;14:01;"Maybe she's not terrible."
14:01;14:02;"She's just sort of--"
14:02;14:04;"Maybe people--I don't know."
14:04;14:05;"People like to tear it down."
14:05;14:06;"Yeah."
14:06;14:10;"The 1987 Bruce Willis album."
14:10;14:11;"That's a fascinating period,"
14:11;14:13;"because he's coming off of ""Moonlighting."""
14:13;14:15;"It's right before he's cast in ""Die Hard."""
14:15;14:16;"Right."
14:16;14:19;"And he cuts this, like, pop album."
14:19;14:20;"Very bizarre."
14:20;14:21;"Pop rock?"
14:21;14:23;"It was kind of--well, it was kind of bluesy."
14:23;14:24;"It was kind of like--"
14:24;14:26;"Jake, I've heard you talk about this album before."
14:26;14:27;"Can we pull it up?"
14:27;14:28;"But I haven't ever heard it."
14:28;14:31;"Just, like, the first track off the '87 Bruce Willis album."
14:31;14:34;"Guys, I think we just figured out that this show,"
14:34;14:36;"we can talk about the Oscars and the Grammys"
14:36;14:37;"by talking about--"
14:37;14:38;"There you go."
14:38;14:42;"That rare breed of person who can elegantly slide between--"
14:42;14:43;"Elegance."
14:43;14:45;"I was about to say the stage,"
14:45;14:46;"but they're stages in both."
14:46;14:48;"The stage and the stage."
14:48;14:49;"The--"
14:49;14:51;"The recording studio and the movie set."
14:51;14:54;"Who can elegantly slide between the silver screen"
14:54;14:56;"and the stream."
14:56;14:57;"I'm all intrigued--"
14:57;14:58;"I'm just intrigued with that."
14:58;14:59;"Apple Music Stream."
14:59;15:00;"That period of Bruce Willis doing ""Die Hard"""
15:00;15:02;"and then making this record, like, within the same year."
15:02;15:06;"Also, how funny is it, Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Willis,"
15:06;15:08;"two guys from South Jersey."
15:08;15:10;"Wait, Bruce--I didn't know that about Bruce Willis."
15:10;15:11;"Yeah, he's from South Jersey."
15:11;15:12;"Wow."
15:12;15:14;"I wonder if he's a Springsteen head."
15:14;15:16;"Seems like he would be, but..."
15:18;15:19;"Wait, this is Willis?"
15:19;15:21;"Yeah, this is Bruce Willis'--"
15:21;15:23;"And I think it did okay."
15:23;15:25;"That fill was so Max Weinberg."
15:25;15:27;"Yeah, it was super important in the USA."
15:27;15:30;"His production is super, like, ""Darkness on the Edge of Town."""
15:30;15:32;"Well, I think it's more like ""Tunnel of Love."""

16:10;16:12;"Very technical drummer."
16:12;16:27;"I feel like he mixed the vocals too low."
16:27;16:28;"It's a real thin vocal."
16:28;16:29;"Yeah."
16:29;16:30;"Compellingly, though."
16:30;16:52;"I'm not sure if I'm going to like this."

17:11;17:12;"Maybe he was like a music, you know, this is classic."
17:12;17:19;"He was just like a guy that liked to do music, but was like not particularly talented."
17:19;17:20;"I don't know."
17:20;17:22;"He was like, I'm kind of famous, but it was before he was really famous."
17:22;17:24;"That's what's weird to me."
17:24;17:26;"It was before he was a big action star."
17:26;17:30;"I mean, on a TV show, it's really weird."
17:30;17:31;"You know what?"
17:31;17:36;"I think we forget most artists are multifaceted or at least they have multiple interests."
17:36;17:38;"You know, when it works, we really remember."
17:38;17:39;"Yeah."
17:39;17:44;"And we're like, wow, Kanye made his sneakers and albums and yet fashion, all these things."
17:44;17:48;"And when it doesn't work, it becomes like a funny footnote."
17:48;17:49;"Right."
17:49;17:50;"Or, you know, I think it worked okay."
17:50;17:53;"So you're just kind of like, you know, the Bruce Springsteen made an album."
17:53;17:54;"Willis."
17:54;17:55;"Oh, right."
17:55;17:56;"I mean, that's just tough."
17:56;17:59;"Like mid eighties Jersey guy named Bruce."
17:59;18:03;"That's an uphill battle coming out."
18:03;18:06;"Well, actually this segues very nicely into something I wanted to talk about with you"
18:06;18:07;"guys today."
18:07;18:08;"Okay."
18:08;18:12;"There's a new song by Kygo and Selena Gomez called It Ain't Me."
18:12;18:15;"I don't think it's been hanging on the top five, so we're not going to get to talk about"
18:15;18:16;"it later."
18:16;18:18;"So I'm making an executive decision to talk about it now."
18:18;18:19;"Okay."
18:19;18:20;"First question."
18:20;18:21;"Do either of you know who Kygo is?"
18:21;18:22;"No."
18:22;18:23;"Dave?"
18:23;18:24;"Uh, vaguely."
18:24;18:25;"All right."
18:25;18:29;"What's your impression of Kygo?"
18:29;18:35;"Maybe he dates someone from a reality show."
18:35;18:36;"What?"
18:36;18:38;"Oh, you're thinking of Tyga."
18:38;18:40;"Oh, right."
18:40;18:41;"Yeah."
18:41;18:43;"Tyga is like a secondary character on Keeping Up With The Kardashians."
18:43;18:44;"Okay."
18:44;18:45;"He's a rapper."
18:45;18:46;"Okay."
18:46;18:47;"Kygo."
18:47;18:48;"He's a singer."
18:48;18:49;"No."
18:49;18:50;"Okay."
18:50;18:51;"He is a musician."
18:51;18:52;"Bass player?"
18:52;18:53;"Yes."
18:53;18:54;"Percussionist."
18:54;18:55;"He's the hottest five string fretless bass player."
18:55;18:56;"The kids are going bananas for him."
18:56;18:57;"Not since Jaco has there been a bassist with this kind of heat on them."
18:57;18:58;"No, Kygo's a DJ."
18:58;18:59;"Like, duh."
18:59;19:00;"I'm just kidding."
19:00;19:01;"He's a singer."
19:01;19:02;"What?"
19:02;19:03;"No."
19:03;19:04;"He's a musician."
19:04;19:05;"Bass player?"
19:05;19:06;"Yes."
19:06;19:07;"Percussionist."
19:07;19:08;"He's the hottest five string fretless bass player."
19:08;19:09;"The kids are going bananas for him."
19:09;19:15;"Not since Jaco has there been a bassist with this kind of heat on them."
19:15;19:17;"Kygo's a DJ."
19:17;19:18;"Like, duh."
19:18;19:19;"Of course."
19:19;19:22;"He's associated with the genre tropical house."
19:22;19:23;"I love that genre."
19:23;19:26;"Which is, you know, it's a little slower."
19:26;19:28;"It's about 100 BPM usually."
19:28;19:30;"Do you guys know who Selena Gomez is?"
19:30;19:31;"Vaguely."
19:31;19:34;"Oh, she's an actress, right?"
19:34;19:35;"Yeah, right."
19:35;19:36;"She's an actress singer."
19:36;19:37;"Was she in Spring Breakers?"
19:37;19:38;"Yeah, she was in Spring Breakers."
19:38;19:39;"She was the girl on the bus."
19:39;19:40;"Yeah."
19:40;19:41;"Who's like, ""I'm out of here."""
19:41;19:42;"Right."
19:42;19:43;"Yeah, she made the good call."
19:43;19:44;"I don't know her music."
19:44;19:47;"I think she started out on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel."
19:47;19:49;"Then she has become a successful singer."
19:49;19:52;"Anyway, they did a song together and it's called It Ain't Me."
19:52;19:54;"What I like about the song, it's kind of tropical house meets."
19:54;20:00;"Remember like a few years ago when there's all that like kind of like EDM folk country"
20:00;20:01;"stuff?"
20:01;20:02;"Oh yeah."
20:02;20:03;"Like what?"
20:03;20:04;"Avicii and Aloe Blacc."
20:04;20:05;"Yeah."
20:05;20:06;"What was that song called?"
20:06;20:07;"Timber?"
20:07;20:08;"Timber was Kesha."
20:08;20:09;"Yeah."
20:09;20:10;"There were a couple of them."
20:10;20:11;"There was a moment."
20:11;20:15;"It was kind of like this post Mumford and Sons meets dance music thing."
20:15;20:17;"So this song, it's interesting."
20:17;20:18;"I like it."
20:18;20:19;"So let me just play it for you guys."
20:19;20:20;"Okay."
20:20;20:21;"And the lyrics-"
20:21;20:25;"Is this similarly like Capitalism at Work in terms of cross branding these two?"
20:25;20:28;"Oh, you mean like did the A&R guy be like, ""Kygo and Selena Gomez match made in heaven."
20:28;20:30;"We're going to hit all the target demos."""
20:30;20:31;"Right."
20:31;20:32;"I mean, maybe."
20:32;20:33;"It's win-win."
20:33;20:36;"It's pairing a hot DJ with like a hot pop star."
20:36;20:37;"It's a no brainer."
20:37;20:44;"I had a dream we were sipping whiskey neat."
20:44;20:51;"Highest floor of the Bowery."
20:51;20:57;"And I was high enough."
20:57;21:01;"Somewhere along the lines."
21:01;21:05;"We stopped seeing eye to eye."
21:05;21:07;"And I had enough."
21:07;21:12;"No, I don't want to know where you've been or where you're going."
21:12;21:16;"But I know I won't be home and you'll be on your own."
21:16;21:21;"Who's going to walk you through the dark side of the morning?"
21:21;21:26;"Who's going to rock you in the sun room where you sleep?"
21:26;21:31;"Who's waking up to drop you home when you're drunk and all alone?"
21:31;21:36;"Who's going to walk you through the dark side of the morning?"
21:36;21:38;"Yeah, I heard this song on the way here."
21:38;21:39;"Oh, really?"
21:39;21:40;"Yeah, yeah."
21:40;21:42;"And then the drop, it just goes on forever."
21:42;21:48;"Like, in another song, it'd be like, and we're back at the verse in two, four, bump."
21:48;21:49;"Nope."
21:49;21:51;"Sticking with the drop for a second."
21:51;21:56;"All right, and we're going to bring back in Selena with verse two, right about."
21:56;22:02;"OK, now we're going to keep going with the drop."
22:02;22:04;"America loves drops now."
22:04;22:05;"Letting it breathe."
22:16;22:18;"The opening lines of the song, I don't know if you caught them."
22:18;22:19;"Yeah."
22:19;22:22;"I had a dream we were sipping whiskey neat."
22:22;22:23;"Right."
22:23;22:26;"Which is not something you hear in a country song, sure, but like,"
22:26;22:29;"I had a dream we were sipping whiskey neat."
22:29;22:34;"Highest floor, the Bowery, nowhere's high enough."
22:34;22:35;"So I love that."
22:35;22:36;"I love that detail."
22:36;22:39;"And also, for anybody who doesn't know, the Bowery is like a fancy hotel"
22:39;22:41;"in downtown Manhattan."
22:41;22:43;"We should try to get Selena Gomez on the show."
22:43;22:47;"I'd love to know how she feels about the lyrics, because I believe she did not"
22:47;22:48;"write any of them."
22:48;22:51;"I do think they're good lyrics, actually, though, because it really, it sets it up."
22:51;22:52;"It paints a picture."
22:52;22:56;"Yeah, I don't know if I've ever heard the phrase whiskey neat in a song."
22:56;22:58;"We were sipping whiskey neat."
22:58;23:00;"Actually, that's-- or maybe that's like some Sinatra."
23:00;23:03;"We were sipping whiskey neat."
23:03;23:05;"Highest floor, the Bowery."
23:05;23:08;"You know, it's similar when we were listening to Chainsmokers' Coldplay song,"
23:08;23:10;"and the lyrics just jumped out as not typical pop lyrics."
23:10;23:11;"Right."
23:11;23:12;"For better or for worse."
23:12;23:15;"But basically, she's getting to the end of a relationship with some guy who"
23:15;23:20;"sounds like he's drunk, he's selfish, he just parties all the time."
23:20;23:22;"And she says-- and I like the pre-chorus."
23:22;23:26;"Who's going to take you home when you're drunken all alone?"
23:26;23:28;"Who's going to do all this stuff that I do?"
23:28;23:29;"Who's going to do it?"
23:29;23:31;"Not her problem anymore."
23:31;23:32;"It ain't me."
23:32;23:35;"And then when you listen to the drop, you very-- it's a funny drop,"
23:35;23:39;"because you very clearly just hear the words whiskey neat in Bowery."
23:39;23:41;"So I wonder if people hear this and just like this,"
23:41;23:43;"like whiskey neat in Bowery, it's so random."
23:43;23:53;"[MUSIC - CHAINSMOKERS, ""LIBERTINES""]"
23:53;23:54;"Did you guys catch that?"
23:54;23:56;"Summer nights in the-- where?"
23:56;23:57;"Libertine?"
23:57;23:58;"The Libertines."
23:58;23:59;"What's that?"
23:59;24:01;"The Libertines are like the English strokes."
24:01;24:02;"Do you remember that, Matt?"
24:02;24:03;"No, no, I never heard of them."
24:03;24:04;"Dave, you heard of them?"
24:04;24:05;"Yeah."
24:05;24:07;"The singer was named Pete Doherty."
24:07;24:09;"There's some debate in the room if it's Doherty or Doherty."
24:09;24:11;"It's hard to tell with English last names,"
24:11;24:14;"and I was at very surprising pronunciations."
24:14;24:16;"They never were huge in America, but in England,"
24:16;24:18;"they truly were like a big phenomenon."
24:18;24:20;"Like the same time as the strokes, early twos?"
24:20;24:22;"Yeah, right after."
24:22;24:23;"Just after."
24:23;24:25;"So they were compared to them a lot."
24:25;24:28;"So the second verse is, I had a dream."
24:28;24:30;"We were back at 17."
24:30;24:35;"Summer nights, the Libertines, never growing old."
24:35;24:36;"And you know, I like it."
24:36;24:39;"It's like about thinking back to your youth,"
24:39;24:41;"how you felt differently then."
24:41;24:45;"I wonder if Selena Gomez is a Libertines fan,"
24:45;24:47;"if she related to the line, or if she was just like,"
24:47;24:48;"""All right, Matt."""
24:48;24:49;"She's like, ""Who's that?"""
24:49;24:50;"I mean, she might know them."
24:50;24:52;"It's certainly not impossible, but like--"
24:52;24:53;"That's like 15 years ago, dude."
24:53;24:55;"How old is she, like 18?"
24:55;24:56;"No, she's older than that."
24:56;24:57;"22?"
24:57;24:59;"My call is that she didn't know who the Libertines were."
24:59;25:00;"Well, one thing's for sure."
25:00;25:02;"She wasn't 17 when they came out."
25:02;25:03;"Right."
25:03;25:06;"Back in the summer of '69."
25:06;25:07;"Yeah, she's 24."
25:07;25:09;"So she, you know, we all listen to music from--"
25:09;25:10;"Yeah, man."
25:10;25:12;"--before we were there."
25:12;25:15;"But again, the reference of the Libertines as like,"
25:15;25:19;"""Man, when we were 17, that was our--"""
25:19;25:21;"I imagine she probably doesn't feel that way."
25:21;25:24;"This is a stark example of a singer"
25:24;25:27;"that's clearly not the writer of the lyrics,"
25:27;25:30;"just because of the references being made."
25:30;25:33;"I mean, I'm not going to go as far as to say that--"
25:33;25:34;"It's not even a problem--"
25:34;25:38;"--that Selena Gomez is incapable of writing a song"
25:38;25:43;"where she embodies the viewpoint of a 39-year-old."
25:43;25:45;"I just don't think she's credited as the lyric writer."
25:45;25:46;"Yeah, no, it's just--"
25:46;25:47;"We know it."
25:47;25:48;"But usually it's interesting."
25:48;25:49;"I just have never thought about that before,"
25:49;25:50;"because usually you're like--"
25:50;25:54;"you're pairing a singer with songs that seem appropriate,"
25:54;25:57;"whether sort of thematically for them to sing."
25:57;25:59;"And this is like a funny disconnect."
25:59;26:01;"Here's a way it makes sense."
26:01;26:04;"She's dating Colin Farrell."
26:04;26:05;"That's too funny."
26:05;26:08;"So let's say Selena Gomez is dating Colin Farrell,"
26:08;26:11;"and at first she's like, ""Oh, he's this suave, older actor,"""
26:11;26:14;"and it's really cool, she's staying at a fancy hotel with him,"
26:14;26:16;"and then little by little she's like,"
26:16;26:18;"""No, dude, you have a substance abuse problem,"
26:18;26:20;"and if I don't break up with you--"""
26:20;26:23;"This is really unfair to all parties involved, by the way."
26:23;26:25;"But she's like, ""I got to get away from you, man."
26:25;26:28;"I thought you were a fun, youthful actor."
26:28;26:30;"Turns out you're just a drunk, man."""
26:30;26:32;"And so she's like, ""I remember."
26:32;26:34;"I was drinking whiskey neat with this dude."
26:34;26:36;"He was telling me about how fancy the whiskey is,"
26:36;26:40;"and that's when it clicked, and I was like, 'I don't care."
26:40;26:43;"I don't care, man. I want to date Kygo.'"""
26:43;26:46;"And then maybe in the second verse--"
26:46;26:47;"actually, it doesn't really hold up."
26:47;26:49;"It doesn't hold up, the perspective."
26:49;26:50;"Anyway--"
26:50;26:55;"I don't care about your '90s British alt-rock either, dude."
26:55;26:59;"Yeah, he was always talking about the Liberties."
26:59;27:01;"Do you guys like this song? I like it."
27:01;27:05;"I like the folky melodies."
27:05;27:07;"[singing]"
27:07;27:09;"I like the phrase ""dark side of the morning"" is good."
27:09;27:11;"Oh, yeah, ""dark side of the morning."""
27:11;27:14;"Which is a subtle Floyd reference."
27:14;27:16;"I mean, I couldn't help it."
27:16;27:18;"It's so subtle, it's non-existent."
27:18;27:19;"It has to be."
27:19;27:22;"Well, I mean, I was like, ""Oh, I thought she was going to say 'moon,'"
27:22;27:24;"like, 'dark side of the moon.'"
27:24;27:26;"And then, ""Oh, morning."""
27:26;27:28;"Wait, I just want to point out--"
27:28;27:29;"I also really like that."
27:29;27:33;"That is-- I can-- Dave, would you consider that a gospel move, the major three?"
27:33;27:35;"Oh, like stepping the chords up?"
27:35;27:39;"That's gospel, right?"
27:39;27:42;"I've heard you play that on the piano before and be like--"
27:42;27:44;"That's that kind of gospel thing."
27:44;27:45;"I'm like, ""A word, I guess it is."""
27:45;27:47;"Oh, because your vibe is like--"
27:47;27:49;"I don't know. I don't know."
27:49;27:52;"It's also very killers."
27:52;27:55;"That passing-- like a passing chord or like a--"
27:55;27:57;"To me, it sounds like a gospel passing chord."
27:57;28:01;"Maybe in this context, because Brandon Flowers and the Killers uses it a lot."
28:01;28:05;"Oh, what's that Killers song that uses that about being a--"
28:05;28:09;"♪ No one has tried to take you home when you're broken ♪"
28:09;28:11;"Very Killers movement."
28:11;28:12;"Right."
28:12;28:16;"Right, this song is kind of like, ""Are we human?"""
28:16;28:23;"So anyway, ""It Ain't Me."""
28:23;28:26;"An endlessly fascinating song from Kygo and Selena Gomez."
28:26;28:27;"I like it."
28:27;28:33;"The guitar in the beginning reminds me of the guitar from ""Sorry,"" actually."
28:33;28:37;"Yeah, like the Bieber ballad."
28:37;28:39;"Yeah, ""Love Yourself."""
28:39;28:40;"Oh, yeah, yeah, ""Love Yourself."""
28:40;28:42;"Yeah, I had the same thought."
28:42;28:43;"Really?"
28:43;28:44;"The same kind of voicing."
28:44;28:45;"I was like, ""The two notes."""
28:45;28:46;"Maybe it's the same person."
28:46;28:48;"I also just like the sentiment."
28:48;28:49;"It's a classic sentiment."
28:49;28:51;"Bob Dylan, ""It Ain't Me, Babe."""
28:51;28:53;"NWA, ""I Ain't The One."""
28:53;28:55;"You know what, Kygo?"
28:55;28:59;"You could probably find a girl who loves the Libertines and fancy whiskey"
28:59;29:01;"and stay in at the Bowery, but it ain't me."
29:01;29:03;"I want to stay at the Standard."
29:03;29:04;"I'm not knocking it."
29:04;29:06;"I want to drink gin."
29:06;29:09;"Yes, Kyle."
29:09;29:10;"And I want to listen to ""Block Party."""

30:15;30:17;"I'm not the only jacked dude"
30:17;30:19;"who loved that song."
30:19;30:21;"Yeah?"
30:21;30:22;"Another jacked dude."
30:22;30:24;"Great lead-in."
30:24;30:26;"Sorry, wait, what is this phrase?"
30:26;30:27;"Jacked dude?"
30:27;30:28;"Jacked just means like muscular."
30:28;30:30;"It was just jacked."
30:30;30:31;"Oh, you were referring to yourself as jacked."
30:31;30:33;"Right, 'cause the people at home probably don't know that I'm jacked now."
30:33;30:36;"You're wearing your blind melon tee, dude."
30:36;30:38;"I'm wearing a blind melon tee, just like..."
30:38;30:40;"Did you end up wearing that to the Grammys?"
30:40;30:41;"No, I kept it real mellow."
30:41;30:43;"I was just like..."
30:43;30:44;"More mellow than a blind melon tee?"
30:44;30:48;"I just wore like kind of a boring, dark, you know,"
30:48;30:51;"like a dress shirt and jacket ensemble."
30:51;30:56;"So, another jacked, muscular, kind of macho guy"
30:56;30:58;"who loved that song was Vin Diesel."
30:58;31:00;"You hear about this?"
31:00;31:01;"No."
31:02;31:05;"I was kind of like researching the song,"
31:05;31:08;"you know, just like normal music nerd stuff,"
31:09;31:11;"like who wrote it, how's it doing,"
31:11;31:12;"what label did it come out on."
31:12;31:15;"And then, so when I searched Kygo It Ain't Me,"
31:15;31:19;"one of the first news suggestions in Google was like,"
31:19;31:22;"""Here Vin Diesel's take on Kygo It Ain't Me."""
31:22;31:24;"And I was like..."
31:24;31:25;"Click."
31:26;31:29;"The bait has been laid, and the fish has been cooked."
31:29;31:31;"""Here Vin Diesel's take."""
31:31;31:32;"That is so random."
31:32;31:35;"I don't have all the info, but there was like a picture"
31:35;31:38;"of Vin Diesel and Kygo together in the studio."
31:39;31:42;"Vin Diesel obviously is like, he's a man about town."
31:42;31:45;"You know, it's not surprising, Vin Diesel knows everybody."
31:45;31:47;"He's the frickin' man."
31:47;31:49;"So I see this picture of them in the studio,"
31:49;31:50;"and I'm like, ""Wow, that's wild."
31:50;31:54;"""Maybe Vin teamed up with Kygo to do an alternate version."""
31:54;31:58;"And then I listened to it, and it sounds more like,"
31:58;32:02;"I guess Vin Diesel knows Kygo, but he posted this version,"
32:02;32:05;"and he like wrote on the internet, ""Hey guys."""
32:05;32:06;"He has like a very deep voice."
32:07;32:09;"""Hey guys, you know I'm really nervous about,"
32:09;32:10;"""you know I normally don't sing,"
32:10;32:12;"""but this song really moved me, and I wanna do some..."""
32:12;32:13;"So anyway."
32:13;32:14;"Is he from South Jersey too?"
32:14;32:16;"He's from New York City, I think."
32:16;32:17;"He's from New York."
32:17;32:22;"So Vin Diesel posts this song, and I was kind of expecting,"
32:22;32:24;"""Okay, maybe Kygo gave him the instrumental."
32:24;32:26;"""Maybe he's like doing his own take,"
32:26;32:28;"""maybe did an alternate version."""
32:28;32:29;"But then this is what it sounds like."
32:29;32:30;"This is so weird."
32:30;32:31;"I know."
32:31;32:35;"(whistling)"

35:38;35:41;"So Vin Diesel, we found out he's just a huge Kygo fan,"
35:41;35:44;"so maybe this was like he's not trying to do anything professional."
35:44;35:47;"He was just like, ""I love this song, and here's me singing over it."""
35:47;35:51;"Just kind of like a sweet gesture to a DJ he respects."
35:51;35:54;"So I was kind of like--I heard that, and I was like, ""All right."
35:54;35:58;"""Me and Vin, just two jack dudes who both like--"""
35:58;36:00;"You're on the same page."
36:00;36:02;"We're on the same page. I was with him."
36:02;36:07;"And then I'm basically describing an Internet rabbit hole or K-hole."
36:07;36:09;"I don't know what people call it."
36:09;36:11;"Because basically I was like, ""I want to learn about the song,"""
36:11;36:13;"and then I see this clickbait."
36:13;36:15;"""Hear Vin Diesel sing the new Kygo Selene Gomez song,"""
36:15;36:17;"and then I click on that."
36:17;36:19;"Now I'm thinking about Vin Diesel, so what's my next move?"
36:19;36:21;"What's his musical life?"
36:21;36:23;"I'm searching Vin Diesel, just seeing what he's up to."
36:23;36:27;"It turns out when he was a teenager, he wasn't listening to the Libertines."
36:27;36:30;"He was growing up in the New York City area."
36:30;36:33;"He was listening to early hip-hop."
36:33;36:36;"And I guess other kind of downtown music."
36:36;36:38;"He was in the scene. So when he was a teenager, it turns out--"
36:38;36:41;"What year was Vin Diesel born? We've got to find that out."
36:41;36:43;"I think probably early '70s."
36:43;36:46;"I'm going to say 1972."
36:46;36:48;"Holy cow! '67."
36:48;36:50;"So he's 50."
36:50;36:51;"He's 49."
36:51;36:52;"He's going to turn 50 this year."
36:52;36:56;"So Vin Diesel was born in 1967 in Alameda County, California."
36:56;36:58;"Oakland."
36:58;37:00;"Diesel has stated that he's of ambiguous ethnicity."
37:00;37:03;"His mother's background includes English, German, and Scottish."
37:03;37:05;"Classic American mix."
37:05;37:07;"But he's never met his biological father,"
37:07;37:11;"and has stated that ""All I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures."""
37:11;37:14;"Diesel has self-identified as definitely a person of color."
37:14;37:18;"So that's interesting. He doesn't really know much about his father's side."
37:18;37:21;"But then they moved to New York, and he was raised by his mom."
37:21;37:25;"And his stepfather, his African-American stepfather, Irving H. Vinson,"
37:25;37:27;"an acting instructor and theater manager."
37:27;37:30;"So that's cool. So he's kind of like growing up downtown New York."
37:30;37:32;"Right, so he's 20 in '87."
37:32;37:34;"So he's 20 in '87."
37:34;37:35;"So when--"
37:35;37:36;"That's--"
37:36;37:39;"At some point when he's a teenager running around '80s New York,"
37:39;37:41;"got punk rock, hip hop, all these things,"
37:41;37:44;"he links up with a guy called Arthur Russell."
37:44;37:45;"What?"
37:45;37:46;"You guys know Arthur Russell, right?"
37:46;37:47;"Of course."
37:47;37:48;"Whoa. Love Arthur Russell."
37:48;37:52;"How would you guys describe Arthur Russell to the listeners who are not familiar?"
37:52;37:54;"He's like a jack of all trades, kind of."
37:54;37:57;"Because he was doing, like, dance music."
37:57;38:02;"And then he was also making kind of sloppy lo-fi recordings of his songs."
38:02;38:03;"Kind of like--"
38:03;38:04;"He's a great cello player."
38:04;38:06;"Before indie was-- well, also the cello, too."
38:06;38:07;"He's a cellist."
38:07;38:12;"Yeah, so he was involved in dance music, '80s New York dance music,"
38:12;38:16;"but also I guess what you could call indie post-punk something."
38:16;38:17;"Yeah."
38:17;38:20;"I think at the time he was a little bit slept on,"
38:20;38:22;"and he died tragically young."
38:22;38:24;"So Arthur Russell is a super cool guy."
38:24;38:25;"Yeah."
38:25;38:28;"And maybe in the past 15 years he's become even more influential"
38:28;38:32;"because of compilations and reissues and stuff."
38:32;38:37;"Any indie musician is definitely a fan or certainly familiar."
38:37;38:43;"So we found evidence that Vin Diesel linked up with Arthur Russell as a teenager."
38:43;38:46;"We've got to shout out Gary at GaryLucas.com,"
38:46;38:48;"who's the dude who posted this on SoundCloud."
38:48;38:49;"Whoa."
38:49;38:50;"And this is how he described it."
38:50;38:54;"""These are fragments of an aborted recording session at Battery Sound,"
38:54;38:59;"New York City, 1986, which brought together fledgling rapper Mark Sinclair,"
38:59;39:01;"today better known as the actor Vin Diesel,"
39:01;39:05;"and avant composer/dance music maven Arthur Russell"
39:05;39:08;"in a project midwifed by Gary Lucas,""--oh, there you go--"
39:08;39:11;"""who discovered Mark Sinclair rapping and breakdancing"
39:11;39:13;"on the streets of the West Village."
39:13;39:18;"This project was greenlighted by Jeff Travis of Rough Trade Records"
39:18;39:23;"and Barry Feldman of Upside/Logarithm Records."""
39:23;39:25;"I'd be remiss not to point out that Jeff Travis,"
39:25;39:27;"who I guess footed the bill for this,"
39:27;39:29;"kind of a well-known guy who ran Rough Trade Records in England,"
39:29;39:37;"signed the Smiths, also put out the Libertines about 20 years later."
39:37;39:41;"So anyway, this guy Jeff Travis has had an eye for talent for 30 years"
39:41;39:46;"from Johnny Marr and Morrissey to Vin Diesel to the Libertines"
39:46;39:48;"and then the Strokes."
39:48;39:50;"So let's listen to some of this."
39:50;39:51;"This is like a weird tape."
39:54;39:56;"[laughter]"
39:56;39:57;"Sounds like him."
40:38;40:41;"Definitely the beat has some of that Arthur Russell, like, echoey flavor."
40:45;40:47;"Let's skip around."
40:59;41:01;"Okay."
41:01;41:03;"Oh, he's getting directions."
41:17;41:19;"Okay, we get the idea."
41:19;41:21;"So anyway, to be fair to Vin Diesel,"
41:21;41:25;"it's not just an actor who suddenly is getting interested in music"
41:25;41:26;"when he hears a good Kygo song."
41:26;41:29;"This guy, music's been a part of his life since he was a teenager."
41:29;41:31;"So weird, the Arthur Russell connection."
41:31;41:32;"That is so bizarre."
41:32;41:34;"He connected with everybody."
41:34;41:36;"Yeah, that's so cool."
41:36;41:39;"So yelling Vin Diesel, breakdancing in the West Village."
41:39;41:41;"Fast and Furious 9."
41:41;41:44;"Like 35 years later, it's so crazy."
41:44;41:47;"After listening to the Kygo song and the Arthur Russell song,"
41:47;41:49;"I was very pro Vin Diesel."
41:49;41:51;"But then, as I'm continuing to research--"
41:51;41:53;"He's a Trump guy."
41:53;41:54;"No, he's not a Trump guy."
41:54;41:56;"[laughter]"
41:56;41:57;"Well, actually, I don't know."
41:57;41:59;"I doubt it. That'd be weird."
41:59;42:03;"It kind of seems like as two of the biggest stars"
42:03;42:05;"in the Fast and Furious franchise,"
42:05;42:09;"it seems like some people, you have to either like Vin Diesel or like The Rock."
42:09;42:11;"And it turns out that they've had some skirmishes on the set."
42:11;42:12;"Okay."
42:12;42:14;"And The Rock's known to be a very level-headed guy,"
42:14;42:17;"but he came out and made a statement basically saying--"
42:17;42:19;"Some people, I think he used the B word,"
42:19;42:23;"are acting like bees on the set."
42:23;42:25;"And a lot of people are like, ""Oh, he's talking about Vin Diesel."""
42:25;42:26;"They don't like each other."
42:26;42:29;"He thinks Vin Diesel's like a diva, annoying,"
42:29;42:33;"and The Rock is more like salt of the earth, knows how to treat people right."
42:33;42:35;"But I guess they're kind of positioned against each other."
42:35;42:37;"You like one or the other."
42:37;42:42;"And then I was checking on some of the latest press that Vin Diesel did."
42:42;42:44;"He was doing an interview in Brazil,"
42:44;42:48;"and I started to be like, ""Man, Vin Diesel needs to get it together,"
42:48;42:49;"because this is not cool."""
42:49;42:51;"So he was doing an interview in Brazil--"
42:51;42:53;"With a Brazilian female journalist."
42:53;42:55;"Okay. What year?"
42:55;42:57;"This year. Very recently."
42:57;42:59;"God, you're so beautiful."
42:59;43:01;"My God, she's so beautiful."
43:01;43:03;"Am I right or wrong? Look at her."
43:03;43:05;"How am I supposed to do this interview?"
43:05;43:06;"It's pretty drunk."
43:06;43:07;"Look at this woman."
43:07;43:08;"It's pretty drunk."
43:08;43:09;"She's so beautiful."
43:09;43:11;"Cognou, man. Talk to me, baby."
43:11;43:13;"Tell me your story."
43:13;43:15;"Tell me your-- Let's get out of here."
43:15;43:17;"Let's go. Let's go have lunch."
43:17;43:18;"My God, I love her."
43:18;43:19;"Look how beautiful she is."
43:19;43:20;"Thank you."
43:20;43:22;"My God, wow."
43:22;43:24;"Also, I know this sounds like it's edited."
43:24;43:26;"He keeps pushing the point so far."
43:26;43:28;"I know it sounds like it's edited, but it's like,"
43:28;43:30;"when somebody's trying to do their job interviewing you,"
43:30;43:32;"I guess you could pay them a compliment"
43:32;43:35;"about an article of clothing, perhaps."
43:35;43:37;"Even to say that they're beautiful once"
43:37;43:39;"is, like, unprofessional."
43:39;43:40;"Yeah."
43:40;43:41;"Did you--"
43:41;43:42;"I'm the Grouch."
43:42;43:44;"I'm the Grouch."
43:44;43:46;"Grouch."
43:46;43:48;"I'm the Grouch."
43:48;43:50;"I love her."
43:50;43:52;"Man, she's so f*cking sexy."
43:52;43:53;"I can't do this interview."
43:53;43:54;"Look at her."
43:54;43:56;"Does anyone say this?"
43:56;43:58;"Guys, what's wrong?"
43:58;43:59;"Am I the only one that's saying it?"
43:59;44:00;"Look at her."
44:00;44:04;"So, Vin Diesel, man, apologize to that journalist."
44:04;44:06;"Get back to rapping."
44:06;44:08;"And get your act together, man."
44:08;44:10;"People have joked about The Rock running for president."
44:10;44:13;"What if there's Vin Diesel's running for the Republicans,"
44:13;44:16;"obviously, and The Rock is for the Democrats?"
44:16;44:17;"Yo."
44:17;44:18;"Insane."
44:18;44:20;"The Rock is more jacked, too."
44:20;44:21;"Yeah."
44:21;44:27;"Okay, so, The Rock wrote a cryptic Instagram post."
44:27;44:29;"'Cause I hope people don't think I'm just pulling out"
44:29;44:31;"this beef out of thin air just because"
44:31;44:35;"they're two bald-headed jack dudes in their 40s."
44:35;44:38;"So, The Rock, who's always been known"
44:38;44:41;"as, like, this super chill dude,"
44:41;44:43;"posted an Instagram where he wrote,"
44:43;44:46;"""This is my final week of shooting Fast & Furious 8."
44:46;44:50;"There's no other franchise that gets my blood boiling"
44:50;44:52;"more than this one."""
44:52;44:53;"I love that."
44:53;44:56;"Then he went on to praise the crew and the female stars"
44:56;44:58;"in the ensemble cast."
44:58;45:01;"So, right there, you know there's about to be a turn."
45:01;45:03;"And then he turns around and says,"

45:33;45:36;"Bottom line is it'll play great for the movie"
45:36;45:39;"and fits this Hobbes character that's embedded in my DNA"

46:15;46:17;"I'm pretty into ""chicken sh--"" as a phrase."

46:20;46:22;"maybe disrespecting the crew."
46:22;46:24;"Just being a punk, probably, dude."
46:24;46:27;"Maybe disrespecting some of the female crew."

46:44;46:46;"And then Rock hears that."

47:04;47:06;"'cause Vin Diesel maybe just walked away"
47:06;47:08;"and said, ""Fuck off. I don't give a shit."""
47:08;47:09;"And then Rock is like, ""Oh, yeah?"
47:09;47:11;"Then why are you walking away?"""
47:11;47:13;"He's too much of a smooth operator businessman"

49:06;49:33;"How good we could have it if we worked together. I feel love should be enough to get it easily done. Maybe love is competition that makes us raise the bar and better ourselves. I'm just here for the reciprocity to drop, now we both see."
49:33;49:58;"Worked together."
49:58;50:15;"We haven't talked about politics in the past few weeks. I'm glad that we reminded people a little bit that we're living in a fascist state. It's getting worse. It's horrible. And that if we don't do more, we might be looking at a diesel presidency. It could happen."
50:15;50:32;"I wonder if we'll get a celebrity vs. celebrity presidential race. You know how there's been this stuff with Trump and Schwarzenegger? Trump is still tweeting about the ratings. To be fair, Schwarzenegger is no hero, he's a Republican."
50:32;50:50;"I could picture that now, based on what we know now, how horrible things are. Imagine if Trump had come out and instead of the Democrats being like, ""We're going to run a well-known, moderate Democrat who has a lot of experience, who's been in the White House."" You know, reasonable things."
50:50;51:09;"We can critique Hillary all we want, but they tried to counter the madness of Trump the celebrity with a true civil servant. And maybe now, next time there's a Trump, they'd be like, ""Can we get Schwarzenegger? Can we get Alec Baldwin?"""
51:09;51:23;"Oh my, yo, that's crazy. Honestly, I can imagine it now. That would be like we are living in a simulation. If Alec Baldwin threw his hat in the ring. And he's really serious during the debate and then just out of nowhere, he just busts out the impression."
51:23;51:32;"And then Trump's like, ""Okay, very funny. It doesn't even sound like me."" And he's like, ""Okay, very funny, doesn't-"" That could happen. On the national stage. I know you are, but what am I?"
51:32;51:48;"What are some other ones besides Diesel and The Rock? It could be the Republicans are like, ""We're running Garth Brooks. We're going to clean up. We're going to mop the floor with you losers."" And then Garth comes out and is just like, ""Oh, don't worry. I'm not as crazy as Trump."""
51:48;51:55;"But then like Loki, he's doing like- And then the Democrats are like, ""Who do we run against Garth Brooks?"" I bet the first name that comes up is Springsteen."
51:55;51:56;"Oprah."
51:56;52:02;"Or Oprah. Oh yeah, that's come up. No, but I'm saying like, I want to like keeping it in like the genre."
52:02;52:06;"This is a funny fantasy. I mean, Bruce would never do it, but-"
52:06;52:11;"Draft Bruce. The great Draft Bruce campaign of 2023."
52:11;52:17;"See, I feel like a lot of the Democratic celebrities are, they're like, they're rational and they're not crazy. So they're like, ""Yeah, I'm not going to run."""
52:17;52:27;"Well, they're rational because they never would have thought they could have won. Now they might think they could win. We're going to get more kind of like narcissistic Democrat celebrities throwing their hat in the ring."
52:27;52:30;"Oh, yo, Kid Rock versus The Rock."
52:30;52:33;"Wow. Yeah, yeah. Republicans 2024."
52:33;52:35;"Oh, Kid Rock's a huge Republican."
52:35;52:36;"Gnarly."
52:36;52:40;"Man, what's his problem? Yo, all right. How about this? Kid Rock."
52:40;52:42;"Versus Eminem. I was just thinking that."
52:42;52:43;"Governor of Michigan."
52:43;52:45;"Oh."
52:45;52:47;"It may be like-"
52:47;52:48;"Depressing."
52:48;52:52;"I'm just picturing like Michigan becomes like this real like battleground for some reason."
52:52;52:53;"Well, it is."
52:53;52:56;"It already is. Oh yeah, I mean, it already is. Like what's happening in Flint."
52:56;53:01;"So, so Michigan becomes, there's like, there's like a civil war in Michigan."
53:01;53:05;"The whole nation's eyes are on who's going to become the governor of Michigan."
53:05;53:08;"Kid Rock's running. He's leading in the polls."
53:08;53:13;"Democrats are running like Todd Williamson, like a local congressman or something."
53:13;53:15;"And he's like getting crushed."
53:15;53:20;"And then just one day out of nowhere, a new song comes on SoundCloud."
53:20;53:28;"And it's Eminem announcing his candidacy for governor of Michigan in a speed rap."
53:28;53:32;"The Democrat bows out and then it's just Kid Rock versus Eminem."
53:32;53:34;"It's really going to happen."
53:34;53:41;"It's hard to imagine that, yeah, the celebrity won't, that strain won't go further."
53:41;53:44;"Oh yeah, Trump broke the seal on that."
53:44;53:46;"I mean, Reagan broke the seal."
53:46;53:48;"Right, but he had to take it so slow."
53:48;53:49;"He had to have like decades of-"
53:49;53:51;"Yeah, he was a governor."
53:51;53:53;"I wonder if we'll ever get a truly jacked president."
53:53;53:55;"Dude, Obama."
53:55;53:56;"Obama was in great shape."
53:56;53:57;"I want a president."
53:57;53:59;"Obama was more jacked than you, dude."
53:59;54:02;"Debatable."
54:02;54:03;"Nah, that's debatable."
54:03;54:05;"I want a president with a goatee."
54:05;54:07;"Is Obama more jacked than me?"
54:07;54:09;"Not really."
54:09;54:10;"Okay, Obama's in great shape."
54:10;54:13;"Obama's probably in the best shape of any president ever."
54:13;54:15;"Dude, don't sleep on W."
54:15;54:17;"Dude worked out for an hour a day."
54:17;54:18;"Really?"
54:18;54:19;"I guess."
54:19;54:21;"W was older, but dude was like-"
54:21;54:22;"Was he hiding some guns under there?"
54:22;54:23;"Yeah."
54:23;54:24;"He was toned, bro."
54:24;54:25;"Really?"
54:25;54:26;"Yeah."
54:26;54:32;"When I picture like president era W with his shirt off, I don't think he's pretty."
54:32;54:36;"He's like going down his clearing brush in Crawford on the weekends."
54:36;54:37;"Clearing brush?"
54:37;54:39;"He's like working on his core, dude."
54:39;54:41;"Do you think he had like visible abs?"
54:41;54:42;"Yeah, I do."
54:42;54:43;"I really do."
54:43;54:46;"Really?"
54:46;54:53;"W aside, there's never been a president with like say like the bulk of a rock."
54:53;54:54;"Of like the rock."
54:54;54:55;"Right."
54:55;54:56;"Well, most of the time they're old, but yeah."
54:56;54:58;"Yeah, maybe they're just too old."
54:58;55:01;"I mean, yeah, Schwarzenegger was governor."
55:01;55:02;"Right, yeah, Schwarzenegger."
55:02;55:04;"That's funny that he was governor."
55:04;55:06;"Dude, and Jesse Ventura was governor."
55:06;55:08;"Oh, well, Jesse Ventura's..."
55:08;55:09;"Dude, that's-"
55:09;55:10;"I don't even know."
55:10;55:11;"Dude, groundwork's been laid."
55:11;55:12;"Ventura, Schwarzenegger."
55:12;55:13;"Rock, dude."
55:13;55:14;"Wrestler/action."
55:14;55:16;"Maybe it will be the rock."
55:17;55:20;"It's just been eight weeks for the eight days"
55:20;55:24;"Since our restart went awry"
55:24;55:27;"I am afraid"
55:27;55:31;"I've been all in on works and not risks"
55:31;55:34;"Thought we'd invest and save"
55:34;55:38;"But it's all rigged again, I'm falling away"
55:38;55:41;"When it's tech, nothing, fighting"
55:41;55:45;"We can only lose"
55:45;55:52;"When it's tech, nothing, killing me and killing you"
55:52;55:54;"'Cause you and me are the same"
55:54;55:57;"Now I'm shining like tears in the rain"
55:57;56:00;"And you're shining like you feel the pain"
56:00;56:05;"But our diamonds blooded, nickel, doll and soul"
56:05;56:10;"No trophy, no cake, winner take nothing"
56:10;56:22;"I want it all, and I want it more"
56:22;56:26;"Baby, I want it all on dream"
56:26;56:28;"And when you no longer ask me"
56:28;56:31;"We'll go to five waves"
56:31;56:36;"I built my life around our love"
56:36;56:38;"To ground your dream world"
56:38;56:41;"I held it so tight"
56:41;56:45;"But I never could give you enough"
56:45;56:48;"When it's tech, nothing, fighting"
56:48;56:52;"We can only lose"
56:52;56:59;"When it's tech, nothing, killing me and killing you"
56:59;57:01;"'Cause you and me are the same"
57:01;57:04;"Now I'm shining like tears in the rain"
57:04;57:07;"And you're shining like you feel the pain"
57:07;57:12;"But our diamonds blooded, nickel, doll and soul"
57:12;57:17;"No trophy, no cake, winner take nothing"
57:17;57:22;"Winner tech, nothing"
57:22;57:29;"Winner tech, nothing"
57:29;57:32;"Winner tech"
57:32;57:38;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1"
57:38;57:42;"On the last episode we had a fascinating conversation with some of the good folks at Play Network."
57:42;57:47;"These are the people who help craft playlists for retail spaces."
57:47;57:53;"And Jake, you had some pretty critical things to say about the music that you hear when you're shopping at Home Depot."
57:53;57:56;"It's just basically like the top five of iTunes."
57:56;58:01;"It's Chainsmokers, it's like Justin Timberlake's song from the Trolls soundtrack."
58:01;58:02;"Oh, that's a good song."
58:02;58:09;"It's just like, you know, the same pop music you hear everywhere."
58:09;58:11;"And for some reason in my mind with Home Depot it was like..."
58:11;58:12;"Something special."
58:12;58:15;"You're like a 40 year old dude buying a toilet seat."
58:15;58:16;"Right."
58:16;58:22;"It's not Chainsmokers, dude. It's like the tasteful side of Contractor Rock."
58:22;58:23;"Okay, well..."
58:23;58:26;"So I made my own playlist for... which I think we should send on to..."
58:26;58:27;"Hold on, hold on."
58:27;58:28;"Okay."
58:28;58:30;"But wait, have we talked about Contractor Rock as a genre yet?"
58:30;58:33;"No, you're good. Jake's getting way ahead."
58:33;58:41;"So the reason we're talking about this is because Jake made a Home Depot playlist that you can listen to via Apple Music on the Time Crisis show page."
58:41;58:46;"On Time Crisis we post the playlist of what we played on the show, but you know this is a super random show."
58:46;58:54;"So a Time Crisis playlist is like probably not good just to throw on at a barbecue or something."
58:54;58:55;"If you're going to Lowe's."
58:55;58:57;"Yeah, definitely not if you're going to Lowe's."
58:57;59:00;"So Jake made a Home Depot playlist."
59:00;59:03;"So, okay, so you... this is what you wrote for the website."
59:03;59:08;"Jake's Dream, colon, Home Depot playlist."
59:08;59:15;"The tasteful side of Contractor Rock music that could theoretically be played in Home Depot and dramatically improve the shopping experience."
59:15;59:19;"In keeping with the Play Network concept of upbeat, relatively positive vibes tunes."
59:19;59:21;"Okay, so Dave asked a great question."
59:21;59:23;"What is Contractor Rock?"
59:23;59:27;"Okay, aka like job site rock."
59:27;59:35;"So like there's some dudes putting up like the Tyvek wrapping on the side of like a new house that they've just framed out."
59:35;59:36;"Right."
59:36;59:40;"There's like a boom box that's blasting like Van Halen and AC/DC."
59:40;59:41;"KLOS."
59:41;59:44;"And GNR, Metallica, exactly."
59:44;59:48;"You're picturing like a suburban white, like middle-aged contractor."
59:48;59:50;"Yeah, and just straight up classic rock."
59:50;59:53;"That's not what I want played at the Home Depot."
59:53;59:56;"What I want is something a little gentler."
59:56;59:58;"Something that's a little more tasteful."
59:58;59:59;"You don't want to hear..."
59:59;01:00:01;"Something that's not hard rock."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"Because like..."
01:00:02;01:00:03;"You don't want to hear like..."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"AC/DC and Guns N' Roses, that's hard rock."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"That's too heavy."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"I don't want to hear hard rock."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"I don't want to hear metal."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"But I don't want to hear soft rock either."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"I want to hear just..."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"No Christopher Cross."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"I just want to hear like rock."
01:00:16;01:00:22;"Like fairly melodic, sort of mid-tempo, tasteful, classy rock."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"So let me see."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"So you started with Badfinger."
01:00:26;01:00:31;"So you enter Home Depot."
01:00:31;01:00:35;"The guy smiles at you."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Mr. Longstrip, welcome back."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"This sounds kind of British."
01:00:39;01:00:42;"Yeah, I think we're British."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"That doesn't get me in Dubai like 2x4s."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"British bands are..."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"Those are rock bands from Britain."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Yeah, but isn't Home Depot like all American?"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"That sounds like that Tom Hanks movie."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Which one?"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"Where he plays the manager."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"Oh, that thing you do."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"It's Badfinger."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Doing that."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"So you also picked Big Star."
01:01:00;01:01:01;"They're American."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Relatively obscure."
01:01:03;01:01:07;"Yeah, I wanted to sneak in a few gems that you wouldn't hear."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"I don't know why Big Star's not on classic rock radio."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"They should be."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Yeah, it's one of those weird things."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"It's like..."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"In what aisle would I find the grout?"
01:01:16;01:01:18;"That would totally work."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"I feel this."
01:01:19;01:01:23;"Look, I'm trying to mount a metal shelving bracket to a concrete pillar."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Do I need a masonry bit for that?"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"You know what?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"I'm going to refer you to my associate, Marsha."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"She will have better information on that."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"Okay, so I have a Nikita impact driver."
01:01:33;01:01:36;"Do you think if I just put a masonry bit in that I could..."
01:01:36;01:01:38;"Oh, Nikita, that's a hell of an impact."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"Oh, do I have to actually rent a hammer drill from you?"
01:01:41;01:01:45;"Okay, you got some Bob Dylan man in me."
01:01:45;01:01:49;"Isn't this more like--this is more like local hardware store."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"This is more like--"
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Exactly."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"Could we bring some of that kindness and warmth?"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"This is like small town."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Hey, Fred."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Hey, Jake."
01:01:58;01:01:59;"Yeah."
01:01:59;01:02:03;"How did that wall mounted--"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"How did the wall mounting work out?"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"It's like a dream, Fred."
01:02:07;01:02:10;"This new--my new--what are you--"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Nikita impact driver."

01:03:03;01:03:04;"Kiss is hard rock."

01:03:05;01:03:06;"Yeah."

01:03:07;01:03:11;"So this is a song that I thought was by Rod Stewart."

01:03:41;01:03:43;"This is three years after Maggie Mae."
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Do you think they had heard Maggie Mae?"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"There's actually a Wikipedia page for this song."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"I actually looked it up, 'cause I was like,"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"what does it deal with this song?"
01:03:52;01:03:55;"Paul Stanley wrote it, and it said--"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"It was speculative on the Wikipedia page,"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"but it said Paul Stanley wrote this song"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"possibly for Rod Stewart."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Oh, maybe they just held on to it."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"It's a great song."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"So basically, you got a lot of '60s and '70s"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"white dad rock."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Yeah."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"It's a specific playlist."
01:04:14;01:04:18;"It's Jake's tasteful side of contractor rock playlist."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"I wasn't trying to go broad here."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"You're not saying this has to play all day."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"No, no, no, no."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"I mean, I would like that."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"I would prefer that."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"Well, if you think about it, Home Depot,"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"it's like, basically, you could make"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"a lot of different playlists that would"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"essentially be older music."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"That's maybe the main thing."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Well, I did-- yeah, you could."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"Yeah, your point stands."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"I did slip in a few more recent things."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"I slipped in a Ween song."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Ween."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"Called ""Your Party."""
01:04:44;01:04:46;"[MUSIC - ""YOUR PARTY""]"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"It's hi-fi."
01:04:47;01:04:50;"It doesn't sound like noisy indie rock."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"It's very professional."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"It's virtuosic."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"That is John Scofield."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"[MUSIC - ""YOUR PARTY""]"
01:04:59;01:05:02;"Oh, the saxophone player?"
01:05:02;01:05:04;"David Sanborn."

01:05:06;01:05:08;"Oh, he's Scofield's guitar player."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"Yeah."

01:05:13;01:05:15;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"I like the idea of also--"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"This seems more like Jig's Sandwich Shop."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"Yeah, no, but--"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"Home Depot."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I like the fantasy of the Home Depot with, like,"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"they're playing, like, Dire Straits, this kind of stuff."
01:05:25;01:05:28;"And then there's, like, the one Ween song slipped in."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"And someone's just like--"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"That is Jake's dream."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"So you want to be hearing tasteful contractor rock."
01:05:34;01:05:38;"But I've got to ask Jake, why not think a step beyond?"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"What if you walked into Home Depot,"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"and instead of just hearing, like, a song that you"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"could listen to anywhere, you're actually"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"hearing, like, soundscapes?"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"You got an example?"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Yeah."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"Well, Brian Eno in 1978, he made Ambient One,"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"music for airports."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"And legend had it, he was always going"
01:05:55;01:05:58;"to make Ambient Two, music for Home Depot,"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"but because there were rights issues."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Music for Quiznos."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"OK, but Ezra--"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"So I'm just saying, like, what if you walked into Home Depot--"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"Put it on."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"But here's the thing, dude."
01:06:07;01:06:10;"If you recall our conversation with Play Network last week--"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"Welcome back, Mr. Longstreth."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"You can't--"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"What are you looking to mount?"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"You can't put the--"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"You can't put the customers to sleep, dude."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Uh, hello."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Welcome to Home Depot."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"Why?"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"If I was, like, looking at different shades of blue paint"
01:06:29;01:06:33;"in the paint aisle, hearing this, like--"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"I bet the Home Depot in the movie Her--"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"Yeah."
01:06:36;01:06:37;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"--is playing this."
01:06:38;01:06:40;"I'm looking for 3/4 inch birch plywood."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"With a birch veneer."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Maybe this is too mellow."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"What about, like--"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"what about, like, some jazz?"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"Would jazz be cool?"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"I'm looking for some 2 by 6 pressure-treated lumber."
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Ethiopian jazz?"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Ooh, this would be cool."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"I would be in."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"You play my contractor rock mix in the morning."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"Or maybe this is the morning music."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"After the sun goes down."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"This is the morning stuff."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"You're coming into Home Depot."
01:07:09;01:07:10;"They open at 7."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"You're rolling in with, like, a cup of coffee."
01:07:12;01:07:14;"You got the breakfast burrito at the cart outside."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"7 AM at the Home Depot--"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Old Ethiopian--"
01:07:20;01:07:23;"--in Wicked Heights, things are popping."
01:07:23;01:07:26;"Old Ethiopian music would improve."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"It's beautiful."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Yeah."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"I guess you might want to hear that more at, like, a place"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"where you get to sit and enjoy it."
01:07:31;01:07:34;"What about something that makes you want to move,"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"but is not, like, rock?"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"No."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"This does not work, dude."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"Wait, OK."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"Wait, is this just too basic?"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"Hold on."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"That was too basic."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Yes, hello."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"No, wait, that's too basic."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"I'm just trying to find a deeper cut from Vivaldi."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"[HUMMING]"
01:08:02;01:08:05;"Jake, welcome back to Home Depot, man."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"Thank you."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"This would be cool on Home Depot."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Blasting--"
01:08:11;01:08:12;"A touch of class."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"Yeah."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Speakers, like, way overhead."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"Yeah."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"Because you can't really play this in a coffee shop."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"Home Depot would be cool."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"The Lawn and Garden Center is--"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Right."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"--for aisles 25 through 31."
01:08:24;01:08:28;"That makes it work again."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"But yeah, I like shopping for grout."
01:08:31;01:08:32;"Oh, Paca Bells."
01:08:32;01:08:36;"I bet there's a Paca Bells cannon on loop."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"But this doesn't make me want to buy stuff."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"No, this is--"
01:08:41;01:08:45;"what retail environment would this work in?"
01:08:45;01:08:48;"A wedding, a bridal shop, David's Bridal--"
01:08:48;01:08:51;"Oh, right, because this is a classic wedding song."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"That would drive me crazy."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"Imagine if you worked in a bridal shop,"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"and you were playing this the whole time."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Maybe an ice cream parlor."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"Like a Baskin Robbins?"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"Or maybe like a Fro-Yo place."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"You have to make a few decisions."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"This music makes you feel kind of classy and intelligent."
01:09:06;01:09:08;"But you don't really need to use your brain."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"All you need to decide is if you want tart or chocolate,"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"and then putting some stuff on it, just like--"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"[imitates crunching]"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"Then you go over and you use the little things"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"to pick up a few strawberries."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"Then you weigh it."
01:09:23;01:09:27;"That'll be 434."
01:09:27;01:09:33;"Then you just sit and eat it, and then you're out."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"It'd be like a nice Fro-Yo place."
01:09:35;01:09:39;"Let me get the footlong turkey, roasted turkey--"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"Not at a Subway."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Sourdough."
01:09:43;01:09:48;"A florist."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Welcome to Burger King."
01:09:50;01:09:55;"That'd be cool at Burger King."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Or like a Flying V."
01:09:58;01:10:01;"Oh yeah, just like a truck stop."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"The highway can be stressful."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"They play music like this at Penn Station"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"in New York sometimes."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"Oh wow."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"It's like Hustle and Bustle."
01:10:11;01:10:13;"It's like an '80s movie."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"It's like the beginning of Trading Places."
01:10:15;01:10:17;"It makes it like trying to catch a--"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"They should play this in the subway."
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Oh, Winthorpe."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"Very good, Valentine."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"It would make--"
01:10:25;01:10:30;"That kind of music makes Hustle and Bustle feel noble."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"A little bit like, ""Oh, something exciting's happening,"""
01:10:33;01:10:37;"versus this disgusting, crowded city"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"pushing through all these horrible people"
01:10:39;01:10:44;"to just squeeze my flesh into this crowded train."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"You know, you want to hear like--"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Is that at Penn Station, you said?"

01:56:24;01:56:26;"Something about the pairing of Doritos--"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"I'm being super, super charitable to Ed Sheeran today,"
01:56:28;01:56:30;"but when I picture, like, the pairing of Doritos"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"and another bottle of wine,"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"that reminds me of just being, like..."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"- It's like college."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"- Yeah, college."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Maybe a little earlier, maybe a little bit later."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"But, like, whatever."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"Between 17 and 26."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"Just being in that zone"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"where you might go to somebody's house"

01:56:52;01:56:53;"And you're just like, ""Uh, sure."""

01:56:59;01:57:00;"You're like, ""I'm down."""

01:57:03;01:57:06;"kind of awkward combo."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"That's what that connects to me."

01:57:09;01:57:11;"The Doritos and the wine."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"- Yeah, 'cause he could have said something else."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"That implies some sort of hodgepodge."
01:57:16;01:57:18;"- That's a tough word to sing."

01:57:20;01:57:22;"- We don't have time to listen to him sing it,"

01:58:30;01:58:32;"earlier in the show, we were talking about Vin Diesel."
01:58:32;01:58:34;"And for legal reasons, we got to clear this up."
01:58:34;01:58:38;"We strongly implied that Vin Diesel is a Republican,"
01:58:38;01:58:41;"or at the very least would run as a Republican."
01:58:41;01:58:44;"Our R&D department got back to us"
01:58:44;01:58:48;"and said that Vin Diesel has never come out as a Republican."
