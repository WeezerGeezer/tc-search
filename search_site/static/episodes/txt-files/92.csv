00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:05;00:08;"This is the Father of the Bride episode."
00:08;00:12;"I'm joined by Jake Longstreth and Ariel Rechshied."
00:12;00:17;"As we play Jake, the new Vampire Weekend album in its entirety for the first time."
00:17;00:22;"He might have heard some of the songs before, but still, this is a historic event."
00:22;00:25;"Please join us now for a very special-"
00:25;00:33;"Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:34;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"They were a felt-robbing leap of my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"Leave the lonely man"
01:19;01:23;"Time Crisis back again. This is a very special episode."
01:23;01:30;"This is the Sunday after the Friday that the new Vampire Weekend album, Father of the Bride, was released."
01:30;01:36;"Obviously we're pre-recording this. We're banking the eps because I'm all over the place with the touring."
01:36;01:42;"We're probably all in New York, realistically, because today's the day when, knock on wood, nothing went wrong."
01:42;01:47;"We're playing our kind of fun New York album release show/party at Webster Hall."
01:47;01:52;"So we probably got a few TC heads there who can't be listening to this, but everybody else can."
01:52;01:58;"But we thought what we would do to air this weekend, because this is like the big weekend after the album drops,"
01:58;02:00;"we would just listen to the album and talk about it."
02:00;02:02;"Because Jake, you still haven't even heard the whole album, right?"
02:02;02:03;"Right."
02:03;02:08;"So basically, let me set the scene. Me, Jake, and RL, Rekshad, what's up?"
02:08;02:09;"Hey."
02:09;02:13;"We're sitting here in Los Angeles, banking an ep about the album."
02:13;02:18;"There's been talk about the album, we've talked about the songs that came out, but we've never gotten too deep on it."
02:18;02:22;"So we might as well just jump into it. Father of the Bride, track one."
02:22;02:25;"We're still a couple weeks out from release, but here it is."
02:25;02:27;"Have you heard this song, Jake? Hold You Now?"
02:27;02:28;"I don't know."
02:28;02:29;"It's one of the ones with Danielle."
02:29;02:34;"I know the reason why you think you gotta leave"
02:34;02:39;"Promises of future glory don't make a case for me"
02:39;02:44;"I did my best and all the rest is hidden by the clouds"
02:44;02:51;"I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now"
02:51;02:59;"Leaving on your wedding day, all calm and dressed in white"
02:59;03:05;"All I keep's the memory of one last crooked night"
03:05;03:09;"The pews are getting filled up, the organ's playing loud"
03:09;03:16;"I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now"
03:16;03:19;"Alright."
03:19;03:30;"I believe in what I believe in, believe in not only you"
03:30;03:41;"I believe in every man, I believe in nothing but you"
03:41;03:44;"This is dope. You never heard this?"
03:44;03:45;"Mm-mm."
03:45;03:50;"I know the reason why you think I oughtta stay"
03:50;03:55;"Funny how you're telling me on my wedding day"
03:55;03:58;"Was that iPhone recording in the beginning or fabricated iPhone?"
03:58;03:59;"Neither."
03:59;04:00;"Was it live?"
04:00;04:03;"It's some hi-fi-ass recording. What the hell are you talking about?"
04:03;04:04;"There is some iPhone."
04:04;04:05;"There's some state-of-the-art."
04:05;04:06;"There's so much, like, great room noise."
04:06;04:08;"Oh, yeah, there's some birds chirping."
04:08;04:10;"There's iPhone recordings on this record."
04:10;04:11;"I know that song."
04:11;04:14;"When things were feeling light"
04:14;04:19;"Turning this June morning into some dark judgment night"
04:19;04:24;"This ain't the end of nothing much, it's just another round"
04:24;04:30;"I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now"
04:34;04:45;"I believe in, believe in not only you"
04:45;04:53;"I believe in every man, I believe in nothing but you"
04:53;04:55;"Who's singing there?"
04:55;04:58;"That's a sample from the Thin Red Line soundtrack."
04:58;04:59;"Ah!"
04:59;05:01;"Did you recognize that?"
05:01;05:03;"Now that you said it, I do."
05:03;05:04;"So that song's called ""Hold You Now."""
05:04;05:05;"That's gorgeous, man."
05:05;05:06;"Oh, thanks."
05:06;05:08;"Very pretty melody."
05:08;05:11;"From pretty early on, I had a feeling that would be a good track one."
05:11;05:15;"I also just like that it opens with just, like, acoustic guitar and vocals."
05:15;05:16;"Mm-hmm."
05:16;05:19;"Which I thought was just, like, such a weird way to open a Vampire Weekend record."
05:19;05:21;"I think by the time you hear the whole song, you're like, ""Okay."""
05:21;05:23;"Even within two minutes, there's some surprises."
05:23;05:25;"You don't even know Danielle's showing up yet."
05:25;05:28;"I'll tell you one thing, because we're doing this on time crisis."
05:28;05:32;"I always knew that this album was gonna have three duets."
05:32;05:34;"And I always knew I wanted to be with the same person,"
05:34;05:36;"and thank God it ended up being with Danielle."
05:36;05:37;"It's, like, so perfect."
05:37;05:41;"But I always knew I wanted these kind of, like, country-inspired--"
05:41;05:44;"I wouldn't really call them country, but clearly they're indebted to, like,"
05:44;05:46;"classic country duet songwriting."
05:46;05:47;"Mm-hmm."
05:47;05:48;"And I wasn't even sure what three they would be,"
05:48;05:51;"but I knew that there should be three spread out around the album."
05:51;05:53;"It's funny, when you work on a record for, like--"
05:53;05:56;"We only worked for maybe two and a half years, like, hardcore, but--"
05:56;05:58;"Two and a half? Right, you did--"
05:58;06:00;"Oh, I was-- Yeah, before-- Well, okay, maybe not us."
06:00;06:02;"Before we were going hard."
06:02;06:05;"But then it is interesting how, like, you start to, like,"
06:05;06:08;"feel, like, the weirdest things scoop you a little bit."
06:08;06:11;"There's even a part of me that's, like, when ""Shallow"" got so big"
06:11;06:13;"as, like, this duet, I was like, ""Oh, man."
06:13;06:16;"Are people gonna hear these songs and be like,"
06:16;06:18;"'Coming off the heels of a 'Shallow'?"""
06:18;06:19;"No? No."
06:19;06:21;"All right. That did not occur to me, dude."
06:21;06:24;"Maybe on this show I'll say some of my, like, biggest insecurities."
06:24;06:25;"Because that happens. You're working on a record--"
06:25;06:27;"Spoken like a true psychopath."
06:27;06:28;"Yeah, maybe I am a psychopath."
06:28;06:31;"But I'm just, like, the first time we ever put down"
06:31;06:35;"some vocals on that song was probably at least 2016."
06:35;06:36;"Oh, yeah, a long time ago."
06:36;06:38;"Yeah, so imagine, you're just, like, working on a song like that,"
06:38;06:40;"and then, you know, you're always thinking about,"
06:40;06:43;"well, first you think about, ""What is the art I want to make?"""
06:43;06:46;"And then later you think about, ""Well, okay, what is the moment it's coming out?"""
06:46;06:49;"And so I guess, okay, I'm glad you think that's crazy."
06:49;06:51;"Just the idea that anybody would ever--"
06:51;06:53;"And look, you know I respect ""Shallow."""
06:53;06:54;"But the idea that anyone would be like,"
06:54;06:57;"perhaps they were inspired by, you know, ""Star is Born"" ""Shallow,"""
06:57;06:59;"and they want to do some duets."
06:59;07:01;"Okay, hopefully not going to happen."
07:01;07:03;"How did you know you wanted three duets?"
07:03;07:05;"Like, had you written the songs yet?"
07:05;07:06;"I had vague ideas."
07:06;07:08;"That's very specific."
07:08;07:11;"I had very vague ideas for what the duets could be."
07:11;07:13;"Like, three specific ideas--"
07:13;07:14;"Lyrical ideas."
07:14;07:16;"Like, this first duet will be this lyrical theme."
07:16;07:17;"The second one will be this lyrical theme."
07:17;07:18;"In a rough way."
07:18;07:20;"And the ideas kind of all came at the same time."
07:20;07:22;"Once I knew it was going to be a double album,"
07:22;07:25;"when I really started to feel strongly, like, we had the songs for it,"
07:25;07:28;"I also had this feeling of, like, I want this to be a double album."
07:28;07:29;"It feels right."
07:29;07:33;"It feels right that our fourth album is not 10, 11 songs."
07:33;07:35;"It felt like it needed more room."
07:35;07:36;"Initially, I wanted it to be 20."
07:36;07:38;"At the last minute, I cut--"
07:38;07:42;"What did I cut? ""Houston, Dubai"" and ""Conversation."""
07:42;07:44;"Those were the two songs I cut at the last minute."
07:44;07:46;"Although, ""Houston, Dubai"" is a Japanese bonus track."
07:46;07:48;"So, shout-out to Japan."
07:48;07:50;"I was trying to explain this to a journalist recently."
07:50;07:52;"I don't know if I had, like, the right language yet."
07:52;07:55;"To me, there's, like, two types of double albums."
07:55;07:57;"There's, like, the kind of white album that's just like,"
07:57;07:59;"""Hey, guys, let's have some fun."""
07:59;08:02;"""Everybody just bring your best songs. I don't care what they're about."
08:02;08:04;"The weirder, the better, and let's just mix it up."""
08:04;08:05;"A mishmash."
08:05;08:06;"""Let's have a true mishmash."""
08:06;08:09;"And, like, you can't really have a mishmash on a 10-song album."
08:09;08:11;"So, then there's the white album paradigm, which is amazing,"
08:11;08:15;"which is kind of just like, ""Hey, each song is its own universe."""
08:15;08:19;"And by putting them next to each other, that's where the kind of vibe comes."
08:19;08:21;"It's the contrast."
08:21;08:23;"And then there's the other type of double album that, to me,"
08:23;08:27;"is probably the best example of is ""Bruce the River,"""
08:27;08:31;"which, you know, as a Jersey guy, that's the ultimate double album."
08:31;08:33;"Very consistent palette on that album."
08:33;08:35;"It's a very consistent-- and a very consistent theme."
08:35;08:39;"It's almost like ""The River"" is almost like a book of short stories"
08:39;08:41;"like Dubliners or something, where it's like,"
08:41;08:46;"""No, he needed more room on that just to explore different personalities and moments."""
08:46;08:49;"But it's all-- you picture it all taking place in the same town--"
08:49;08:51;"- Oh, yeah. - --or the same world."
08:51;08:53;"It's not 20 different worlds next to each other."
08:53;08:54;"It's one world."
08:54;09:00;"He needed the room to maybe hit on different emotions and moments within that time."
09:00;09:04;"So, anyway, that was a little more like what I wanted ""Father of the Bride"" to be like."
09:04;09:08;"And, of course, there's like the genres, maybe, and the references go all over the place,"
09:08;09:11;"but I actually think, lyrically, it's one of the most unified albums."
09:11;09:17;"So, anyway, I thought that the duets would actually help reinforce that by having--"
09:17;09:22;"it's weird to say ""characters,"" but by having the same two people kind of meet,"
09:22;09:26;"even in different moments, and sing together, I thought would help unify."
09:26;09:31;"Because I didn't want it to be like, ""Oh, why is the album like 18, 20 songs?"""
09:31;09:33;"You know, just because we stopped editing."
09:33;09:36;"There was actually more rigorous editing on this than ever before."
09:36;09:41;"So I thought the duets are kind of like the tentpole moments that unify it."
09:41;09:43;"You remember anything about making that song, Ariel?"
09:43;09:45;"Yeah, I remember all of it."
09:45;09:49;"The good, the bad--it's crazy how many versions we did, considering how simple it is."
09:49;09:50;"Sort of, I mean--"
09:50;09:54;"We were tweaking the bass sound, like the synth bass forever."
09:54;09:57;"There's a lot of different places to listen to music these days,"
09:57;10:03;"whether it's on your iPhone speaker, on your laptop speaker, through your Sonos,"
10:03;10:05;"and your car stereo."
10:05;10:09;"It's hard to get certain elements to read on all of them, so--"
10:09;10:10;"Oh, so you were doing that?"
10:10;10:11;"Oh, yeah."
10:11;10:13;"You would, like, record a bass, and then, like--"
10:13;10:15;"How's this going to sound on the laptop speakers?"
10:15;10:17;"Kind of, or we would just--you know, I mean--"
10:17;10:18;"Go jump in the car, classic."
10:18;10:19;"Oh, that makes sense."
10:19;10:21;"Yeah, you can't, like, those notes disappear."
10:21;10:22;"Let's figure out a different way."
10:22;10:23;"Sometimes it's a--"
10:23;10:24;"Wow."
10:24;10:26;"You know, sometimes you're plagued by the key of the song."
10:26;10:30;"Sometimes it's just an arrangement thing, like you realize you should--"
10:30;10:33;"bass line should be an octave up, or whatever it is."
10:33;10:37;"But kind of to your question about when you disrespected my production"
10:37;10:40;"by asking if it was an iPhone recording, the way I--"
10:40;10:41;"Not a disrespect."
10:41;10:44;"It would have been a strong artistic choice."
10:44;10:45;"Jake loves lo-fi."
10:45;10:50;"The way some of these--sometimes the best way to, you know, hear a song"
10:50;10:53;"is just to put up a mic and record Ezra performing it."
10:53;10:54;"Yeah."
10:54;10:55;"And that is what we did."
10:55;10:57;"He was kind of introducing me to some of the material,"
10:57;10:59;"and I put a mic up, and it was super casual."
10:59;11:01;"Most of the recording is pretty casual."
11:01;11:04;"You know, a lot of it took place in my house downstairs,"
11:04;11:09;"which is kind of where the natural union of Danielle and Ezra"
11:09;11:12;"came together, I would say, on the record a little bit."
11:12;11:15;"It was just very natural, like among friends."
11:15;11:17;"Sometimes when I've been doing press for this record--"
11:17;11:19;"maybe I should have asked you guys."
11:19;11:23;"It's not a big secret, but occasionally I'd be talking to a journalist,"
11:23;11:26;"and they might be like, ""So how did Danielle end up on the record?"""
11:26;11:28;"And I was like, ""Well, you know, it started--it was just very easy"
11:28;11:30;"because we were working on a song, and we'd say, like,"
11:30;11:32;"'Oh, man, we want to try some harmonies on this,'"
11:32;11:34;"and we'd just be like, 'Well, Danielle lives upstairs,'"
11:34;11:36;"so she'd come downstairs, she'd put down the harmonies."""
11:36;11:38;"And then sometimes people would just look at me half-confused, like,"
11:38;11:42;"""Yeah!"" But nobody would ever follow--like, ""What do you mean she lived upstairs?"""
11:42;11:43;"I just don't know if they were--"
11:43;11:45;"She has an apartment above the studio."
11:45;11:47;"Yeah, I just don't know if they thought that was a metaphor,"
11:47;11:50;"or maybe they just knew. They're like, ""Oh, because, you know,"
11:50;11:54;"you're working at Arielle's home studio, and you guys live upstairs."
11:54;11:55;"No big deal."""
11:55;11:57;"Yeah. It's okay. It's not a secret."
11:57;11:59;"I mean, it's not--we don't advertise it, but--"
11:59;12:02;"That you guys live above the studio."
12:02;12:04;"Well, it's not--there's not even the main studio."
12:04;12:05;"Anyway, it's the home studio."
12:05;12:06;"It's the home studio, yeah."
12:06;12:11;"We did it--it was very casual, old friends, all of us, you know?"
12:11;12:16;"So the initial bit of that recording is that."
12:16;12:20;"Just, I think the door was open, outside sounds."
12:20;12:21;"And he goes, ""Okay."""
12:21;12:22;"Exactly."
12:22;12:23;"I love that."
12:23;12:24;"I mean, literally--"
12:24;12:25;"Yeah, we repeated it at the end."
12:25;12:28;"Well, what happened was, when he was done showing it to me,"
12:28;12:30;"he just took the headphones off. He's like, ""Okay."""
12:30;12:32;"And then we were talking about it a bit more,"
12:32;12:37;"and Ezra was explaining that he's always liked that bit from Thin Red Lion,"
12:37;12:39;"and, you know, the chords are similar."
12:39;12:43;"So I do think that's when I was just like, ""Let's throw it in there."""
12:43;12:45;"And then we just started [bleep] with that, and I was like, ""Oh, that's pretty fresh."""
12:45;12:48;"And then, because of the weird timing, you had to stretch it out,"
12:48;12:50;"so that's why there's like that [imitates stretching sound]"
12:50;12:51;"It was just--"
12:51;12:52;"Oh, I love that at the end."
12:52;12:55;"Yeah, we were just messing--it was just like--you know, it wasn't on a grid,"
12:55;12:59;"meaning, like, it wasn't on any specific tempo or anything like that,"
12:59;13:03;"so it could have taken a few more minutes and tried to make it feel like it was in time,"
13:03;13:04;"but I didn't--just kind of--"
13:04;13:05;"You know what's funny? Speaking of--"
13:05;13:09;"It was like a mood board idea that then just turned into the arrangement of the song."
13:09;13:11;"You know what's funny? Like, a really thoughtful journalist,"
13:11;13:13;"you're probably not going to agree with a lot of them, but--"
13:13;13:15;"I'm a thoughtful journalist."
13:15;13:17;"You are a thoughtful journalist."
13:17;13:19;"You, not so much. No."
13:19;13:20;"[laughter]"
13:20;13:21;"But--"
13:21;13:22;"Very thoughtful."
13:23;13:26;"But the funny thing is, I guess it's not--it's not even just journalists."
13:26;13:28;"Anybody who spends a lot of time with their music, a fan, whatever--"
13:28;13:29;"Yeah."
13:29;13:31;"--just making up s--t in their head about how things went."
13:31;13:33;"That's what's cool."
13:33;13:35;"It's like--or it's like the more you're into an album,"
13:35;13:39;"the more your imagination is going to run--it's true for us, too, like, with records."
13:39;13:43;"I especially would preface it with, ""And in my imagination, this is what happened."""
13:43;13:44;"Right, versus a hard fact."
13:44;13:47;"A lot of people just write down, like, ""So clearly this is what happened."""
13:47;13:48;"You know?"
13:48;13:49;"Yeah, right."
13:49;13:50;"Clearly."
13:50;13:51;"Yeah, you don't always know it."
13:51;13:53;"Clearly it was an iPhone recording."
13:53;13:57;"Not that, but, you know, a lot of people have these hard ideas about--"
13:57;13:58;"Yeah."
13:58;13:59;"--what you were listening to, what influenced you--"
13:59;14:00;"Right."
14:00;14:01;"--what the process was."
14:01;14:04;"""Oh, you did this because of, you know, this motivation,"" or whatever,"
14:04;14:05;"and it's like, ""What the--?"""
14:05;14:06;"Right, right."
14:06;14:07;"It would be more--"
14:07;14:08;"Yeah."
14:08;14:09;"--it would be more fair for somebody to say, like, ""Listen, the way--"
14:09;14:10;"I actually have no idea."
14:10;14:12;"Yeah, I have no idea, but the way I hear it--because that is interesting,"
14:12;14:13;"the way somebody else hears something."
14:13;14:15;"It might not be what you intended."""
14:15;14:17;"And by the way, it's a beautiful thing, open for interpretation, but--"
14:17;14:18;"It is a beautiful thing."
14:18;14:20;"--let's just not rewrite history is all I'm trying to say."
14:20;14:21;"No, I feel you."
14:21;14:24;"But I remember talking to a thoughtful person who--"
14:24;14:28;"they were really interested in that part where I said--where I go, ""Okay."""
14:28;14:29;"And they were into it."
14:29;14:31;"They were, like, really into the album, and they were really into the song,"
14:31;14:35;"and they said something like, ""That moment on 'Hold You Now,' track one,"
14:35;14:40;"before that big sample comes in, you sound very resigned."
14:40;14:44;"You're very weary, and you say, 'Okay,' as if you know that the sample"
14:44;14:49;"that's about to come in--it's like a meta-commentary on sampling."""
14:49;14:51;"And I was just kind of like, ""Oh, that's--it's, like, amazing that you're"
14:51;14:53;"thinking of it that way."""
14:53;14:54;"You know, I don't know."
14:54;14:56;"I guess clearly--obviously we never thought that."
14:56;14:58;"We just had it there."
14:58;15:02;"But when you leave in studio chat, or we even repeated it at the end,"
15:02;15:06;"it is because you want there to be--I guess they're right that you were"
15:06;15:08;"creating some sort of meta-commentary."
15:08;15:10;"Like, if you really want to clean up the edges of a song,"
15:10;15:12;"you don't leave stuff in."
15:12;15:14;"Yeah, it makes it really alive."
15:14;15:17;"It gives it a real sense of time and space."
15:17;15:20;"I remember going by the studio a few times and being surprised."
15:20;15:23;"I was like, ""Ooh, the new Vampire Weekend album."""
15:23;15:28;"I was picturing a big studio with the separation rooms and the huge board"
15:28;15:30;"and the glass windows."
15:30;15:32;"Yeah, major label debut, all that."
15:32;15:35;"Yeah, and I remember just thinking, ""Oh, this is an interesting vibe."
15:35;15:36;"I dig this."""
15:36;15:38;"They're just R&L's basement--or not basement, just like the--"
15:38;15:39;"Downstairs."
15:39;15:41;"Yeah, the downstairs studio."
15:41;15:45;"Like a room that's maybe 12 by 14 feet."
15:45;15:47;"Nothing fancy."
15:47;15:49;"It's less than this, for sure."
15:49;15:50;"This is interesting."
15:50;15:52;"Like, you guys doing drums here?"
15:52;15:53;"We did."
15:53;15:54;"Yeah, we did some drums."
15:54;15:56;"You know, occasionally we go to a bigger studio."
15:56;15:57;"Barely."
15:57;15:58;"But you know how it is."
15:58;16:02;"Half the time we're just hanging out talking, so why pay an arm and a leg"
16:02;16:06;"just to shoot this [bleep] with your buddies?"
16:06;16:09;"Just the real music from Big Pink over here."
16:09;16:10;"Yeah, basically."
16:10;16:13;"It's nice to have the door open, the birds chirping."
16:13;16:15;"Step outside, get some sunshine."
16:15;16:19;"Well, that's also a weird thing is perhaps for good acoustic reasons,"
16:19;16:23;"most real professional studios don't have windows."
16:23;16:27;"So, you know, you could be in there like 2 p.m. on a beautiful day,"
16:27;16:28;"and it might as well be 2 a.m."
16:28;16:32;"And it's just that, like, gray eggshell soundproofing on the wall."
16:32;16:34;"Just sitting on a black leather couch."
16:34;16:36;"Very depressing."
16:36;16:40;"And I've actually come to realize recently because I had some pretty bad jet lag--"
16:40;16:41;"Cold."
16:41;16:49;"--in my travels that, you know, sunlight is very important for regulating your body."
16:49;16:50;"Get a little vitamin D."
16:50;16:51;"I guess this is pretty obvious."
16:51;16:52;"Most people know this."
16:52;16:55;"But I would just like--like ways to beat jet lag,"
16:55;16:56;"and people are just like, ""Go stand in the sun."""
16:56;16:59;"And then you realize, like, there's some days where you don't get very much direct sunlight."
16:59;17:01;"And they're like--and this is where it gets tricky."
17:01;17:04;"They were like, ""The sunlight has to hit your eyeballs."""
17:04;17:05;"So no shades."
17:05;17:06;"Got to be careful."
17:06;17:07;"Oh, wow."
17:07;17:08;"Who's they?"
17:08;17:09;"You know, some, like--"
17:09;17:10;"Hippies."
17:10;17:14;"--someone put a fourth down on the first page of Google website"
17:14;17:24;"called, like, medicaldoctors-health.co.uk with, like, a lot of pop-up ads, that kind of thing."
17:24;17:25;"Very difficult to read."
17:25;17:26;"Yeah."
17:26;17:28;"But basically it said--it was somebody who was saying,"
17:28;17:30;"""You know, I get people who have trouble sleeping,"
17:30;17:33;"and everybody's so focused on getting blackout curtains"
17:33;17:35;"and making sure that there's no light coming in at night."""
17:35;17:36;"And I'm like, ""Well, you know what?"
17:36;17:39;"What about making sure there is light coming in during the day?"""
17:39;17:42;"Anyway, well, track two is ""Harmony Hall."""
17:42;17:43;"[guitar music]"
17:43;17:44;"Classic."
17:44;17:46;"So that's a great one, too."
17:46;17:48;"Well, thank you."
17:48;17:52;"And actually, it's kind of similar in that they have this sort of, like,"
17:52;17:53;"very pretty acoustic verse."
17:53;17:54;"Right."
17:54;17:59;"And then there's an unexpected chorus or instrumental sort of break"
17:59;18:01;"with, like, the piano in this one."
18:01;18:02;"Same acoustic."
18:02;18:03;"Chord in the same room."
18:03;18:04;"Oh, it is the same acoustic?"
18:04;18:05;"Yeah."
18:05;18:06;"[singing]"
18:06;18:07;"We only had the one."
18:07;18:08;"Yeah."
18:08;18:09;"The little guy."
18:09;18:11;"Yeah, well, because I've heard this a lot."
18:11;18:15;"Hearing the first song now, this totally recontextualizes this."
18:15;18:19;"I'm hearing how, like, kind of lo-fi the verse is,"
18:19;18:22;"and then how iPhone-esque."
18:22;18:23;"It's cool."
18:23;18:27;"[singing]"
18:27;18:29;"Yeah, this always felt like a good--"
18:29;18:30;"[singing]"
18:30;18:33;"This always felt like a good one-two punch opening the album."
18:33;18:35;"It's also funny, too."
18:35;18:38;"I've been thinking about that a lot lately, how you work so hard"
18:38;18:41;"making this body work the album, and then you have to pick singles,"
18:41;18:43;"and you have to pick, like, whether they're real singles"
18:43;18:46;"or just taster tracks or whatever."
18:46;18:48;"It's such a crazy thing that you have to do."
18:48;18:50;"You work so hard on this thing, and then you're like,"
18:50;18:52;"now we have to unveil it little by little."
18:52;18:55;"You know, like, you can't pick a song that defines the album."
18:55;18:59;"And like you said, the context of Harmony Hall as track two"
18:59;19:01;"is so different than just, like, Vampire Weekend's back."
19:01;19:03;"Check out our new single, Harmony Hall."
19:03;19:04;"Whatever, that's how it works."
19:04;19:07;"Unless you do surprise releases, which have their pros and their cons."
19:07;19:12;"By the way, I think this is the first take of your vocal also."
19:12;19:13;"Some of it."
19:13;19:15;"I think pretty much all of it."
19:15;19:18;"Not the harmonies, but the lead vocal."
19:18;19:23;"I swear I only did one or two takes day of years before it came out."
19:23;19:24;"Wow."
19:24;19:26;"And same with--"
19:26;19:30;"And then it was just figuring out the, like, production, the piano stuff."
19:30;19:31;"Yeah."
19:31;19:34;"[MUSIC - HARMONY HALL, ""HARMONY HALL""]"
19:34;19:50;"This is one of the last additions here, this guitar that comes in."
19:50;19:55;"This guitar right here is one of the final things."
19:55;20:00;"Oh, yeah."
20:00;20:01;"Yeah."
20:01;20:03;"Really ruffled some feathers at the time, though."
20:03;20:04;"Wait, now, is Dave singing on this?"
20:04;20:05;"Yeah."
20:05;20:07;"Yeah, Dave and Danielle sing backup vocals."
20:07;20:09;"Anybody else?"
20:09;20:10;"No."
20:10;20:11;"Is Dave singing the lyrics?"
20:11;20:12;"Yeah."
20:12;20:15;"Nice!"
20:15;20:18;"Oh, Stephen, fine!"
20:18;20:21;"[MUSIC - HARMONY HALL, ""HARMONY HALL""]"
20:21;20:43;"OK, you want to talk about iPhone jig?"
20:43;20:44;"This is it."
20:44;20:45;"So you know there's two parts there?"
20:45;20:46;"Beautiful."
20:46;20:48;"So the baroque part--"
20:48;20:50;"[VOCALIZING]"
20:50;20:52;"So we did that at RALs."
20:52;20:53;"But then in the other--"
20:53;20:56;"To a click track, or just, like, no, to this?"
20:56;20:57;"Oh, OK."
20:57;20:58;"To the rest of it."
20:58;21:00;"Then also below here--"
21:00;21:02;"[VOCALIZING]"
21:02;21:05;"It's more in the left."
21:05;21:06;"Mm-hmm."
21:06;21:08;"[VOCALIZING]"
21:08;21:15;"So that part was in New York at the time, playing the piano at my apartment in New York."
21:15;21:18;"So that was probably three or four years ago."
21:18;21:21;"And I was just thinking of different ways that I could play the chords,"
21:21;21:23;"just, like, phrase them a little differently."
21:23;21:25;"So I was just-- I'm going, bum, bum, bum."
21:25;21:27;"So I made an iPhone recording so I wouldn't forget it."
21:27;21:31;"And then I played it for RAL, and it was like, oh, just send me the voice memo."
21:31;21:34;"That actually is legitimately iPhone recording."
21:34;21:36;"[VOCALIZING]"
21:36;21:41;"We tried a lot of different tambourines on this song."
21:41;21:42;"Yeah, how do you like that one?"
21:42;21:43;"The tambo?"
21:43;21:44;"Yeah, love it."
21:44;21:45;"Solid tambo."
21:45;21:46;"Great tone."
21:46;21:48;"You think about the tone of tambos?"
21:48;21:50;"I don't, actually."
21:50;21:52;"This part's classic."
21:52;21:53;"Greg Lee's ""Shout Out."""
21:53;21:55;"I wrote this part on piano."
21:55;21:57;"I could never play it on guitar."
21:57;21:59;"Now Brian Jones plays it live."
21:59;22:01;"[MUSIC - BRIAN JONES, ""SHOUT OUT""]"
22:13;22:17;"That kind of boogie piano that comes in there, that's Tommy King."
22:17;22:18;"Tommy King nailed it."
22:18;22:20;"Endless cast of characters."
22:20;22:25;"Yeah, I was thinking about how many songs are on this album where multiple people"
22:25;22:26;"played the same instrument."
22:26;22:29;"Like, different people played bass, different people played guitar,"
22:29;22:30;"different people played piano."
22:30;22:32;"It's a very steely band."
22:32;22:34;"Oh, right, yeah, bringing a dude just to do, like, one part."
22:34;22:37;"Yeah, one drummer on the chorus, one drummer on the verse."
22:37;22:38;"Wow."
22:38;22:40;"[MUSIC - TOMMY KING, ""SHOUT OUT""]"
22:42;22:46;"That Tommy King piano stuff there is my favorite part of the whole album."
22:46;22:47;"Just those little riffs."
22:47;22:49;"Did he just, like, improv that, or was that--"
22:49;22:52;"Yeah, we gave him some direction, but he did--"
22:52;22:55;"he probably just did four or five takes in a row, just, like, doing his thing"
22:55;22:57;"and picked the best moments."
22:57;22:58;"Huge song."
22:58;23:01;"Yeah, I appreciate that you've always rode for that song, Jake."
23:01;23:02;"Oh, yeah."
23:02;23:04;"That gave me some confidence in the studio."
23:04;23:07;"That's definitely a top Vampire song for me."
23:07;23:08;"Top five Vampire?"
23:08;23:09;"Oh, for sure."
23:09;23:10;"Nice."
23:10;23:11;"Maybe top three."
23:11;23:12;"Wow."
23:12;23:16;"That's not-- that's not-- means words here, folks."
23:16;23:17;"See, that's what gets tough."
23:17;23:19;"You get older, man, you know."
23:19;23:20;"People grew up."
23:20;23:23;"They have so many years of memories with your old albums."
23:23;23:26;"The idea that you could truly reshuffle their top five--"
23:26;23:29;"you can't teach an old dog new tricks always."
23:29;23:31;"You could be bringing some heat."
23:31;23:33;"You really think you're going to reshuffle my top five, man?"
23:33;23:34;"It's not easy."
23:34;23:35;"Yeah, it's tough with bands, right?"
23:35;23:37;"Let alone my top three."
23:37;23:40;"When I started working with you guys on Modern Vampires,"
23:40;23:45;"Rostam pointed out that I didn't really know any of your previous material."
23:45;23:47;"Like, you probably heard A-Punk or something."
23:47;23:49;"Yeah, I heard-- and I went to one of your shows even,"
23:49;23:53;"but, you know, like I hadn't really lived with it in that kind of way."
23:53;23:54;"Which was for the best."
23:54;23:56;"I think it was for the best."
23:56;23:59;"I remember meeting Rivers Cuomo randomly."
23:59;24:01;"Lead singer of Weezer."
24:01;24:02;"Editor's note."
24:02;24:08;"And it's a long time ago, but, you know, I was a huge fan of those first couple albums."
24:08;24:09;"Sure."
24:09;24:12;"And I told him, you know, I'm like, ""That's the s--t of Pinkerton."""
24:12;24:15;"And he's like, ""Well, if you're such a fan of Pinkerton, how could you--?"""
24:15;24:16;"What about Maledroit?"
24:16;24:19;"""Aren't you going to just want us to be the old Weezer?"""
24:19;24:21;"I'm like, ""Yes."""
24:21;24:22;"I didn't get the job."
24:22;24:23;"Well, better to be honest."
24:23;24:24;"Yeah, no."
24:24;24:26;"He said, ""I am a conservative."""
24:26;24:30;"I like that idea of you producing a Weezer album."
24:30;24:31;"You piqued my interest."
24:31;24:33;"Yeah, but he wants to, you know, he wants to push forward."
24:33;24:34;"I understand that."
24:34;24:35;"Yeah."
24:35;24:39;"And also the truth is, you can't step in the same river twice."
24:39;24:40;"No pun."
24:40;24:43;"You can't step in the same rivers twice."
24:43;24:45;"Maybe Rivers also, it's like--"
24:45;24:50;"Also, well, you know, he famously has kind of a complex about Pinkerton."
24:50;24:51;"Yeah."
24:51;24:53;"Because the album didn't do very well at the time."
24:53;24:54;"Or that's what they say."
24:54;24:55;"I'm sure it did fine, but it didn't--"
24:55;24:56;"No, no, no."
24:56;24:57;"I think it didn't do well."
24:57;24:59;"It didn't match the success of the first album."
24:59;25:01;"I bought it the week it came out."
25:01;25:02;"Oh, really?"
25:02;25:03;"Me too."
25:03;25:04;"So, Rivers, if you're listening--"
25:04;25:05;"I always liked it."
25:05;25:09;"I would hear the singles on kind of late night on K-Rock in New York, and I was like, ""This"
25:09;25:10;"is great."""
25:10;25:13;"But anyway, River, he-- whatever, I read an article."
25:13;25:16;"I read a charticle once, a clickbait."
25:16;25:23;"I was on men'shealth.doctor.co.uk, and I read a series of decontextualized quotes about"
25:23;25:24;"that album."
25:24;25:30;"And it said that his feeling was he really put himself out there with the lyrics, showed"
25:30;25:35;"unpleasant sides of his own mind, I guess, and felt like he was really--"
25:35;25:36;"Punished?"
25:36;25:41;"Well, he felt like he put himself-- he went out naked on Main Street, and he didn't even"
25:41;25:42;"sell that many records."
25:42;25:44;"And he's like, ""What was I doing?"
25:44;25:46;"I feel embarrassed by that."
25:46;25:51;"I feel like I overshared, and I thought I was being a real artist by being so honest."""
25:51;25:55;"And then it didn't even pay off, and so not only did I embarrass myself, I messed things"
25:55;25:56;"up for the band."
25:56;25:59;"That seemed to be kind of what I took away from his interpretation."
25:59;26:03;"And then he was like, ""My favorite band growing up was Kiss, so I should just go back to being"
26:03;26:07;"weird, just guarded, oblique rock star."""
26:07;26:08;"Maybe."
26:08;26:11;"And who's to say-- I don't know if that's what he literally said, but then--"
26:11;26:12;"No, no, no, I'm making that up."
26:12;26:13;"But I know he's a huge Kiss head."
26:13;26:14;"Right."
26:14;26:17;"And that's-- it's kind of seemed like that would be the natural reaction if he got burned."
26:17;26:22;"And then later, a lot of journalists would always bring up the fact that, ""Okay, but"
26:22;26:24;"it paid off in the long run, right?"
26:24;26:28;"Because that album, I think it eventually went platinum or something."""
26:28;26:32;"So he got that commercial success, and he also got the critical love."
26:32;26:34;"I think also the critics didn't like it when it first came out."
26:34;26:35;"No, yeah, that's the thing."
26:35;26:39;"And then later critics like Reed got into it, and then a whole generation of musicians"
26:39;26:43;"and dudes in emo bands were like, ""That's my favorite album of all time."""
26:43;26:47;"And so I would-- whatever, journalists would bring this up to him, and it kind of seemed"
26:47;26:48;"like it was cold comfort."
26:48;26:52;"You'd think that he still felt weird about it, but anyway."
26:52;26:53;"I think the truth is--"
26:53;26:55;"Why did he go down that path?"
26:55;26:57;"Oh, because I was talking about old versus new."
26:57;27:01;"And I think that-- I felt that way about Modern Vampires, too, just getting up there playing"
27:01;27:02;"some of those songs."
27:02;27:07;"I was like, ""This feels-- even to me, feel as familiar to me or the audience as the first"
27:07;27:08;"two albums."""
27:08;27:12;"Especially because the first two albums were like, towards so crazy."
27:12;27:17;"I've probably played A-Punk well over a thousand times in my life."
27:17;27:21;"And then you get up there with new songs, and then you realize, even if you get good"
27:21;27:25;"reviews and people are excited when it first comes out, it still is this long-term process."
27:25;27:26;"Well, I remember the shows--"
27:26;27:27;"To reshuffle somebody's top five."
27:27;27:29;"--last year that I saw you play."
27:29;27:36;"I remember thinking, ""Wow, Yahe is really a classic late set, foundational closer."""
27:36;27:38;"I don't know if it's actually literally close."
27:38;27:39;"I guess you close with shows with--"
27:39;27:40;"Walcott was the--"
27:40;27:41;"Yeah, Walcott."
27:41;27:42;"--the show with the show with the show."
27:42;27:43;"Yeah, but Yahe has become a good--"
27:43;27:44;"Yahe is a deep, late set."
27:44;27:45;"I remember thinking--"
27:45;27:46;"Yeah, bottom of the eighth kind of song."
27:46;27:51;"Yeah, that's a cool-- it's cool that that song is right in there."
27:51;27:55;"There is something weird about-- I mean, Time already passes in a weird way."
27:55;27:59;"I think everybody would agree with that, especially as you get older, especially if you live in"
27:59;28:00;"Southern California."
28:00;28:02;"Is that the next song?"
28:02;28:03;"""Time Passes in a Weird Way""?"
28:03;28:06;"♪ Time passes in a weird way ♪"
28:06;28:10;"♪ Especially if you're living in Southern California ♪"
28:10;28:12;"♪ Do do do do do ♪"
28:12;28:14;"[laughs]"
28:14;28:18;"But my best way of remembering what years things happened or what years Vampire Weekend"
28:18;28:23;"albums came out, where I can be like, ""That was definitely 2012,"" because Modern Vampires"
28:23;28:24;"was not out."
28:24;28:25;"Right."
28:25;28:29;"I guess it's kind of just like life, like family and friends and stuff."
28:29;28:33;"It can be sometimes funny to be like, ""Whoa, there was a time where I literally didn't"
28:33;28:35;"know any of these people."
28:35;28:38;"The people I see every day, I literally didn't know."""
28:38;28:43;"There's a time in my life where ""Yahe"" wasn't our bottom of the eighth song, and I didn't"
28:43;28:45;"know any of you guys."
28:45;28:47;"You know, there's something trippy about that."
28:47;28:48;"It is weird."
28:48;28:49;"Anyway."
28:49;28:50;"New friends become old friends?"
28:50;28:51;"Yep."
28:51;28:54;"Old enemies become new alliances."
28:54;28:56;"Different people sit on the Iron Throne."
28:56;28:57;"Damn."
28:57;28:58;"All sorts of shit changes."
28:58;28:59;"Old friends betrayed."
28:59;29:01;"Old friends betrayed."
29:01;29:03;"Alliances tarnished."
29:03;29:04;"What's track three?"
29:04;29:06;"We are at a leisurely pace here."
29:06;29:07;"[laughs]"
29:07;29:09;"Track three, ""Bambina."""
29:09;29:10;"Have you ever heard it?"
29:10;29:11;"No."
29:16;29:17;"Okay."
29:42;30:01;"Sick."
30:01;30:03;"Fuzz bass."
30:03;30:05;"Very Matt Sharp."
30:05;30:06;"Thank you."
30:35;30:53;"To an extent, yeah."
30:53;30:55;"I forgot about that part."
30:55;30:56;"[laughs]"
30:56;30:57;"Tight."
30:57;30:58;"Weird third song."
30:58;30:59;"Dig it."
30:59;31:00;"Minute 43."
31:00;31:01;"I love it."
31:02;31:04;"Well, I also feel like Harmony Hall is over five minutes."
31:04;31:06;"We want to keep things moving."
31:08;31:09;"You're familiar with this one."
31:09;31:10;"Oh, yeah."
31:10;31:11;"Performer."
31:11;31:12;"That's right."
31:12;31:14;"Whip that solo."
31:14;31:15;"Yeah, man."
31:15;31:16;"Love that solo."
31:16;31:18;"Honored to be on it."
31:23;31:25;"Huge solo."
31:27;31:29;"I should have added Southern California."
31:31;31:34;"Have you ever had a guitar solo on alternative radio?"
31:34;31:36;"No."
31:36;31:38;"I shouldn't have had to think about that."
31:38;31:39;"[laughs]"
31:39;31:41;"For some reason, I took a beat."
31:41;31:49;"Well, Jake has performed on many albums, which is why he's eligible to join the Recording Academy and the Grammys, as previously discussed on Time Crisis."
31:49;31:52;"This is an annual cycle we go through."
31:54;31:55;"It's cool."
31:55;31:57;"Have you heard it on the radio?"
31:57;31:58;"No."
31:58;31:59;"That's [bleep] me."
31:59;32:00;"What radio station?"
32:00;32:01;"K-Rock?"
32:01;32:02;"I think they do."
32:02;32:03;"KCRW?"
32:03;32:05;"Morning Becomes Eclectic, probably."
32:05;32:07;"Harmony Hall is still kind of like the single."
32:07;32:09;"Yeah."
32:09;32:14;"Really overselling my contribution to the song."
32:14;32:15;"It's a hot moment."
32:15;32:18;"It's emotional."
32:18;32:19;"Great."
32:19;32:23;"You're really emoting through your instrument, which is not easy to do."
32:31;32:59;"[laughs]"
32:59;33:02;"We talked about this one a little bit previously on Time Crisis."
33:02;33:05;"This one had a bunch of different versions."
33:05;33:11;"I think that one of the days that came by, I think you guys played me three or four versions."
33:11;33:12;"And were we just like, ""Which one's the best?"""
33:12;33:14;"Yeah, I was like, ""I don't know, guys."""
33:14;33:23;"Well, I do remember Ezra just being like, ""Not sure if he wanted this song on the album,"" and you were like, ""Definitely put this on the album."""
33:23;33:24;"Yeah."
33:24;33:25;"And I was like, ""See?"""
33:25;33:27;"I was nervous that this song was too simple."
33:27;33:29;"That's kind of what I said before."
33:29;33:32;"And again, I have my own taste."
33:32;33:36;"I think oftentimes the simpler the song, the deeper it really is."
33:36;33:39;"But then I just get a little bit in my head."
33:39;33:43;"But it's interesting, the coalition of people who are into this song behind the scenes--"
33:43;33:44;"Common thread."
33:44;33:48;"And that's why sometimes you need to play stuff for people and just be like, ""Whoa, those--"""
33:48;33:49;"Because we always talk about it in the studio."
33:49;33:55;"We'll come back and be like--I'll be telling Ariel, ""Oh, yeah, I played this for Rashida,"" or whoever."
33:55;33:57;"And be like, ""Well, what did they think?"""
33:57;33:58;"And it doesn't mean you always agree."
33:58;33:59;"Everybody has their taste."
33:59;34:03;"But it's sometimes interesting to be like, ""Oh, they like that and that person like that."
34:03;34:04;"Okay."""
34:12;34:13;"Here it comes."
34:13;34:14;"Oh, hold on, hold on."
34:14;34:15;"Quiet, quiet, quiet."
34:15;34:16;"This is Jake's part."
34:18;34:20;"This is better."
34:20;34:21;"Jake."
34:31;34:32;"That's it."
34:34;34:36;"You know what I like about that part also?"
34:36;34:37;"Let's just rewind."
34:37;34:38;"Rewind."
34:38;34:40;"Just like Funkmaster Flex stuff."
34:40;34:45;"I also like--I guess this is an Ariel thing, but I like the way that that part--"
34:45;34:48;"Well, because also in every other verse of the song, we would do that--"
34:49;34:50;"Like that pumped up part."
34:50;34:52;"But this is like the last verse."
34:52;34:53;"That was your idea."
34:53;34:55;"It's like, ""Let it chill a little bit."
34:55;34:56;"Woo, woo."""
34:56;34:57;"And it's like a surprise."
34:57;34:59;"Oh, rather than the, ""Da-na-na-na-na."""
34:59;35:00;"It's like the Jake moment."
35:00;35:05;"But I also like that I always thought of it like Jake has this chill little guitar riff,"
35:05;35:07;"and then the organ answers it."
35:07;35:08;"It's like a call and response."
35:08;35:09;"You know?"
35:11;35:13;"It really is like it's saying something."
35:14;35:15;"And then this guy--"
35:16;35:18;"And then the organ says something."
35:21;35:24;"I like how the bass is really raw, too."
35:24;35:26;"A real instrumental moment."
35:32;35:33;"Oh, yeah, this part."
35:45;35:46;"Well, it's good sequencing, too."
35:46;35:50;"If you're worried about this being too straightforward, Bambina was a trip."
35:50;35:52;"It's like a short little--"
35:52;35:53;"Right."
35:55;35:59;"And now, actually, this is one of my favorite new ones to play live."
35:59;36:01;"It's like I love playing this with the band."
36:01;36:04;"Is Brian crushing a solo over the end here?"
36:04;36:05;"Or is he just like unison with you?"
36:05;36:07;"[Humming]"
36:07;36:09;"Brian's playing acoustic."
36:09;36:10;"When we've been jamming it live--"
36:10;36:11;"Well, not jam."
36:11;36:13;"I don't want people to get--"
36:13;36:14;"Not that type of jam."
36:14;36:16;"Live, we just kind of--"
36:16;36:19;"Because we're not going to do a live fade out, so we just kind of go through it then."
36:19;36:21;"So we just kind of do like a little--"
36:21;36:22;"Everybody just adds little things."
36:22;36:24;"Will goes a little crazy on piano."
36:24;36:26;"You know, CT had some fills."
36:26;36:27;"And I just started going--"
36:27;36:29;"[Humming]"
36:29;36:30;"Just adding like a few strokes."
36:30;36:32;"What were you going to say, Ryland?"
36:32;36:33;"Well, I had a couple things to say."
36:33;36:40;"One is that Emily Lazar, the person who masters all of the Vampire Weekend records,"
36:40;36:45;"among many other records, Grammy-winning mastering engineer at this past Grammy's,"
36:45;36:47;"she thought that ""Bambina"" was a single."
36:47;36:48;"Interesting."
36:48;36:50;"Yeah, that's always funny."
36:50;36:51;"I mean, wow."
36:51;36:54;"There's other people who wrote really hard for ""Bambina."""
36:54;36:56;"I always just think it's a good sign that--"
36:56;36:57;"I mean, it's a thing."
36:57;36:59;"It's a cliche at this point."
36:59;37:03;"I've always said when we've made albums, every song needs to be somebody's favorite."
37:03;37:04;"Now, no surprises."
37:04;37:07;"Certain songs are going to be a lot of people's favorite."
37:07;37:11;"I just always feel like when you start making records where you could play it for like 100 different people"
37:11;37:14;"and you'd say, ""What's your favorite?"" and everybody would say the same two songs,"
37:14;37:17;"it really means that you're starting to make boring albums."
37:17;37:20;"Or you're just hitting the same tone over and over again."
37:20;37:24;"Even when people pick kind of random ones, it's kind of like on the last album."
37:24;37:27;"There were a lot of people--I'm not going to name names--"
37:27;37:30;"but there were a few notable people who really weren't--"
37:30;37:32;"or not that they weren't into Hannah Hunt,"
37:32;37:39;"but at least three, even more than that, times where people really questioned if it should go on the album."
37:39;37:41;"And look, I get crazy too."
37:41;37:42;"I said this shouldn't be on the album."
37:42;37:44;"I said Diane Young shouldn't be on the album."
37:44;37:50;"That's always when we're in that moment where we didn't have the quite last arrangement breakthrough."
37:50;37:53;"I'm acting out a little bit when I say that."
37:53;37:54;"I know it's classic."
37:54;37:57;"You're deep into the creative process."
37:57;37:59;"If we can't figure this out, it can't be on the album."
37:59;38:00;"F it, dude."
38:00;38:01;"Yeah, f--- it."
38:01;38:03;"We'll do it live."
38:03;38:05;"We'll do it live, dude."
38:05;38:08;"Okay, take me a second to get that."
38:08;38:13;"But back to ""This Life,"" speaking of the fade-out live,"
38:13;38:19;"or the lack of, there's a lot of cool stuff that happens behind that fade-out in the recording as well."
38:19;38:20;"Oh, yeah."
38:20;38:21;"It's like a whole--"
38:21;38:22;"They got lost, you mean?"
38:22;38:23;"They got mixed out?"
38:23;38:25;"Yeah, I mean, at a certain point, you got to fade the f--- out."
38:25;38:27;"That song's not short."
38:27;38:28;"What's it clocking in at?"
38:28;38:29;"Four?"
38:29;38:30;"No, longer."
38:30;38:31;"Four thirty."
38:31;38:32;"All right."
38:32;38:33;"No, yeah, because there's like this extended version."
38:33;38:36;"That thing could have been like a cool five thirty if we just let it go."
38:36;38:39;"There's an extended version where like Anjali Kejah is singing."
38:39;38:40;"Who's that?"
38:40;38:41;"She's our friend."
38:41;38:44;"She's originally from Benin, kind of came up in France."
38:44;38:46;"She's like a legendary singer."
38:46;38:48;"I've done stuff with her more recently."
38:48;38:54;"She's done everything, like from kind of like African dance, pop, traditional music."
38:54;38:56;"She's done like Philip Glass symphonies."
38:56;38:57;"Wow."
38:57;38:58;"Character on Neo-Yokio?"
38:58;39:00;"Character on Neo-Yokio."
39:00;39:03;"So she sang at the end of This Life and it got-"
39:03;39:06;"Yeah, like she stopped by and put down some vocals and they were great, but it's like"
39:06;39:08;"just in the final version it didn't-"
39:08;39:12;"But just like more bass ripping, Jimmy Johnson going off."
39:12;39:13;"Oh yeah."
39:13;39:14;"On bass?"
39:14;39:15;"Oh yeah."
39:15;39:17;"He's the dude who plays fretless."
39:17;39:18;"Oh, sick."
39:18;39:21;"Next album you have to get my Uncle Ted to play bass."
39:21;39:22;"Yeah?"
39:22;39:23;"Sick fretless player."
39:23;39:24;"They could really build it down on fretless."
39:24;39:25;"Oh my God, dude, he's a monster."
39:25;39:28;"In my mind, Ted and Jimmy Johnson look alike."
39:28;39:29;"Oh, because you've met Ted before."
39:29;39:30;"I have."
39:30;39:31;"At like Richard Picture shows maybe?"
39:31;39:32;"No."
39:32;39:33;"Or-"
39:33;39:35;"Well, maybe more than once, but yeah, you know what?"
39:35;39:38;"At a Richard Picture show and also at your wedding party."
39:38;39:39;"Oh yeah, cool."
39:39;39:40;"Uncle Ted."
39:40;39:42;"Track five we've already discussed."
39:42;39:44;"I'll just let it play as we speak."
39:44;39:47;"Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you."
39:47;39:48;"Nice."
39:48;39:52;"I was so overcome with emotion when I was hurt and in need of a friend."
39:52;39:55;"This is one of my favorite songs on the record."
39:55;39:56;"It's like-"
39:56;39:59;"Did the Japanese version make it in time?"
39:59;40:00;"Yeah."
40:00;40:06;"One of the other Japanese bonus tracks is like a radical reconfiguration of Big Blue."
40:06;40:07;"Oh, really?"
40:07;40:08;"Yeah."
40:08;40:12;"That's so sick when that comes in."
40:12;40:20;"I was so overcome with emotion when I was hurt and in need of affection."
40:20;40:22;"Shout out to Greg Lees once again."
40:22;40:24;"Beautiful playing here."
40:24;40:27;"Then you're off the protection."
40:27;40:30;"And then I found out."
40:30;40:33;"The way this came together is really a miracle."
40:33;40:37;"Yeah, it started with me and DJ Dahi beat, very different."
40:37;40:40;"Once my life I felt close to you."
40:40;40:42;"What's going on here with the ""oh""?"
40:42;40:44;"It's like a choir sound."
40:44;40:45;"A sample?"
40:45;40:46;"Well, no, it's like-"
40:46;40:47;"Yeah, it is."
40:47;40:51;"I don't know what the part, but it's not a sample that we took it from a record."
40:51;40:53;"There's sampled choirs that we played."
40:53;40:55;"It's a sampled instrument."
40:55;40:56;"On the keyboard?"
40:56;40:57;"Yeah."
40:57;41:01;"Let my back on the horn."
41:01;41:05;"Big Blue, once my life I felt close to you."
41:05;41:08;"Really cool fan art that came out of this song."
41:08;41:12;"Yeah, Big Blue actually gets the most fan art."
41:12;41:13;"Nice imagery."
41:13;41:14;"You guys jam this one out?"
41:14;41:15;"Oh, yeah."
41:15;41:18;"I really like the live arrangement because the song's a minute 49."
41:18;41:22;"I also feel like on an 18 song album, like, of course, it's like tempting."
41:22;41:25;"You know, you have a song like Big Blue and you could."
41:25;41:29;"There'd be one way of listening to it where you'd be like, all right, well, we got the chorus."
41:29;41:33;"Let's write a verse and let's, you know, but there was also something I was like, I don't know."
41:33;41:35;"It felt good to repeat that line."
41:35;41:39;"Some songs, the recording can be like a jumping off point."
41:39;41:42;"It's like a brief fleeting idea, whatever."
41:42;41:49;"So anyway, yeah, songs like 2021 Big Blue, when we perform them live, it doesn't feel great to just get up there for a minute 49."
41:49;41:51;"And it's actually fun to work on the arrangement."
41:51;41:55;"I mean, it seems perfectly prone for jamming out."
41:55;42:01;"Yeah. And not even necessarily on some like true improvisatory jamming out, but even just in the rehearsal room being like, what else could we do?"
42:01;42:02;"Right."
42:02;42:05;"And so those ones actually have grown a lot live and I'm sure they'll continue to."
42:05;42:07;"Tough choice don't make me laugh."
42:07;42:08;"My life's a joke."
42:08;42:09;"You heard this one?"
42:09;42:10;"No."
42:10;42:12;"You broke my heart at midnight mass."
42:12;42:14;"Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past."
42:14;42:19;"The only choice you gave to me is one I took reluctantly."
42:19;42:24;"Because when we play democracy, you always take immunity."
42:24;42:29;"How long do we sink to the bottom of the sea?"
42:29;42:33;"How long, how long?"
42:33;42:38;"How long do we sink and it's only you and me?"
42:38;42:41;"How long, how long?"
42:41;42:46;"How long?"
42:51;42:55;"How long?"
42:55;43:01;"How long?"
43:01;43:03;"What's the point of getting clean?"
43:03;43:05;"You wear the same old dirty jeans."
43:05;43:08;"What's the point of being seen?"
43:08;43:10;"Those eyes are crude, those eyes are mean."
43:10;43:12;"What's the point of human beings?"
43:12;43:14;"A sharpie face on tangerines."
43:14;43:19;"Why is it fed like Halloween since Christmas 2017?"
43:19;43:24;"How long?"
43:24;43:29;"How long, how long?"
43:29;43:31;"How long do we sink?"
43:31;43:35;"Wow, you just keep me guessing here with these."
43:35;43:37;"It's like every measure there's a new sound."
43:37;43:39;"It's cool."
43:39;43:43;"Damn, real kaleidoscope here."
43:43;43:46;"I love where this song goes in the last verse."
43:46;43:51;"How long?"
43:51;43:52;"How long?"
43:52;44:02;"How long?"
44:02;44:03;"This is my favorite part."
44:03;44:10;"Getting to the top wasn't supposed to be this hard."
44:10;44:12;"The house is on Mulholland Drive."
44:12;44:14;"The car's on Sunset Boulevard."
44:14;44:17;"The registration's here with me."
44:17;44:19;"Neither of us has the key."
44:19;44:22;"We can live down in the flats."
44:22;44:24;"The hills will fall eventually."
44:24;44:29;"How long do we sink to the bottom of the sea?"
44:29;44:33;"How long, how long?"
44:33;44:38;"How long do we sink and it's only you and me?"
44:38;44:42;"How long, how long?"
44:42;44:46;"How long?"
44:46;44:51;"How long?"
44:51;44:55;"How long?"
44:55;45:00;"How long?"
45:05;45:09;"How long?"
45:09;45:11;"How long?"
45:11;45:14;"This one's a trip."
45:14;45:19;"How long?"
45:19;45:21;"You want to know something real trippy?"
45:21;45:22;"Yeah?"
45:22;45:24;"This is the one Ezra and I thought was the biggest single."
45:24;45:25;"Oh, interesting."
45:25;45:27;"It's not as poppy as the others, you know."
45:27;45:28;"Well, it's not even that."
45:28;45:32;"Also, I want to say, like, truly, no song ever makes the album,"
45:32;45:34;"and this is true with all four albums,"
45:34;45:35;"I've never allowed a song to be on the album"
45:35;45:38;"if I didn't have a moment of it being my favorite song."
45:38;45:39;"You know, so--"
45:39;45:40;"Sure."
45:40;45:41;"Like the thing I was saying before,"
45:41;45:42;"it's got to be somebody's favorite."
45:42;45:44;"It's not that I-- even with singles,"
45:44;45:47;"it's that I necessarily prefer one to the other."
45:47;45:49;"It's that you just think as you're working on a song,"
45:49;45:51;"oh, this is the one that other people are going to hear"
45:51;45:53;"and be like, this should be a single."
45:53;45:54;"It's poppy."
45:54;45:56;"It has, like, a simple hook."
45:56;45:58;"I mean, like, for instance, I never would go around being like,"
45:58;46:00;"oh, Big Blue, that's a single."
46:00;46:01;"No."
46:01;46:03;"On a very basic level, it's like a poem."
46:03;46:05;"It's a minute 49, the lyrics are repeated,"
46:05;46:07;"but I think we just thought, like, oh, how long?"
46:07;46:09;"Like, that sounds like a single."
46:09;46:11;"To me, that song is more straightforward"
46:11;46:12;"than, like, Harmony Hall,"
46:12;46:14;"but this is maybe where I'm tripping."
46:14;46:15;"I mean, this one was a real--"
46:15;46:17;"like, the production on this song was crazy."
46:17;46:19;"It almost, like, was, like, similar to, like,"
46:19;46:21;"looking at a highly detailed realist painting"
46:21;46:24;"where you can kind of just keep looking and looking"
46:24;46:26;"because there's so many things to see."
46:26;46:28;"So as this song was unfolding, it's like every--"
46:28;46:30;"there was, like, a new sound every, like,"
46:30;46:32;"two measures or something."
46:32;46:33;"It was, like--"
46:33;46:34;"Not really."
46:34;46:39;"I mean, it had a really, like, a very '90s, like, hip-hop--"
46:39;46:42;"Like, a sort of guitar bass, drums, piano."
46:42;46:43;"Right."
46:43;46:45;"[imitates guitar]"
46:45;46:46;"Bass."
46:46;46:47;"Is that bass?"
46:47;46:49;"No, I always said that this was kind of like"
46:49;46:51;"the '90s pastiche a little bit."
46:51;46:56;"It truly reminds me of '90s alt-rock and hip-hop and pop."
46:56;46:59;"It's like a collage of the '90s, I thought."
46:59;47:00;"Not lyrically, but--"
47:00;47:01;"So there's a--"
47:01;47:02;"Not even all the production either, but--"
47:02;47:03;"A while there where you're thinking,"
47:03;47:04;"""This is the single."""
47:04;47:06;"How is it that, like, you arrive at Harmony Hall"
47:06;47:07;"as the first--"
47:07;47:10;"Well, I don't think we were like, ""This is the single."""
47:10;47:11;"We just--you know, I think--"
47:11;47:12;"You were excited."
47:12;47:13;"Well, not even--"
47:13;47:15;"Every now and then, you just think you're doing--"
47:15;47:16;"We like the song."
47:16;47:17;"Yeah, and you just think you're doing a song,"
47:17;47:18;"and it's like, ""Oh, okay, well, you know."""
47:18;47:20;"I mean, people are gonna like this one."
47:20;47:21;"And, I mean, some people do."
47:21;47:22;"Yeah."
47:22;47:24;"Well, and also, you know, I don't know."
47:24;47:25;"You're making a record,"
47:25;47:27;"and you hope that there's something for everybody,"
47:27;47:29;"so you just start to daydream a little bit about, like,"
47:29;47:31;"""Oh, is this the one that that type of person"
47:31;47:32;"might react to?"""
47:32;47:33;"Right."
47:33;47:35;"It seemed like the basic one, really, in a way,"
47:35;47:37;"'cause it has, like, the repetitive chorus."
47:37;47:39;"It kind of seemed like the simplest or something."
47:39;47:40;"Yeah, how do you choose singles?"
47:40;47:43;"You know, it's a conversation between everybody who works on--"
47:43;47:45;"Even simpler than this life on some level, you know."
47:45;47:46;"Yeah."
47:46;47:47;"A lot of levels."
47:47;47:48;"But, no, I'm glad that people think it's weird"
47:48;47:50;"better than thinking it's basic."
47:50;47:52;"But the way you pick singles is--"
47:52;47:54;"it's just like a conversation everybody has."
47:54;47:57;"I've always found it somewhat easy to be, like,"
47:57;47:59;"open-minded about it,"
47:59;48:01;"if, like, say, the label has a strong feeling."
48:01;48:03;"You know, some people get in, like, big fights with the label,"
48:03;48:04;"like, ""No, you're wrong."
48:04;48:05;"This is the single."""
48:05;48:07;"And I've just always kind of been like,"
48:07;48:10;"""Listen, you guys let me make the album I want to make."
48:10;48:11;"I'll listen to you."""
48:11;48:13;"And generally speaking, we've never actually been"
48:13;48:15;"on some harsh, like, old-school label,"
48:15;48:17;"so it's always been a conversation anyway."
48:17;48:19;"The A&R man says, ""I don't hear a single."""
48:19;48:22;"Well, and also, that's when people truly get into"
48:22;48:24;"nightmarish conflicts."
48:24;48:25;"It's not when somebody says,"
48:25;48:26;"""Hey, I really like this song."
48:26;48:28;"I think you should consider it for your first single."""
48:28;48:30;"That's, like, what you want to happen."
48:30;48:32;"And then you say, like, ""Well, yeah, of course I like this song, too."
48:32;48:33;"I put it on the album."""
48:33;48:35;"But what's really bad is when people play somebody an album"
48:35;48:37;"and somebody goes, ""This can't come out."""
48:37;48:39;"Like, ""Why? I worked really hard on this."
48:39;48:40;"There's not a single."""
48:40;48:44;"""Well, I think, actually, that my song 'Southern California,'"
48:44;48:46;"it would be a great single."""
48:46;48:47;"""What are you, a moron?"
48:47;48:49;"This would sink like a stone."
48:49;48:50;"The fans wouldn't be excited."
48:50;48:51;"Radio wouldn't touch it."
48:51;48:52;"The critics are going to hate it."""
48:52;48:54;"And compared to Albert Hammond's"
48:54;48:56;"""It Never Rains in Southern California,"""
48:56;48:57;"it's garbage."
48:57;48:58;"It's garbage."
48:58;49:00;"You know Albert Hammond Sr., my friend."
49:00;49:01;"That's heavily trod ground."
49:01;49:03;"Those are serious conflicts people get into."
49:03;49:05;"And they're like, ""But then what? I don't have a single?"""
49:05;49:07;"And they're like, ""Well, what about that demo that you made"
49:07;49:08;"that I always said was great?"""
49:08;49:09;"And you're like, ""Oh, I hate that song."""
49:09;49:13;"""Go finish the song. Listen to me. I know this bit."""
49:13;49:15;"That's when you get these crazy things where you hear years later"
49:15;49:17;"a musician telling a story, like,"
49:17;49:19;"""I made a lot of bad decisions when I--"
49:19;49:20;"when I first got involved."""
49:20;49:21;"Well, you hear the opposite, too."
49:21;49:22;"I mean, let's not, like, just completely--"
49:22;49:23;"No, no, I'm saying that it's never--"
49:23;49:25;"--get behind the major label."
49:25;49:27;"No, no, I'm saying that it's never been my experience."
49:27;49:28;"Right."
49:28;49:31;"And I think that's the extreme thing that happens."
49:31;49:33;"So the idea of--"
49:33;49:36;"You know, there's times I've, like, questioned a little bit."
49:36;49:38;"Like, I remember on Modern Vampires,"
49:38;49:40;"there was some debate within the organization"
49:40;49:43;"about what should be the next single after ""Dying Young."""
49:43;49:45;"Should it be ""Unbelievers"" or ""Don't Lie""?"
49:45;49:47;"And I thought they're both great songs."
49:47;49:48;"I truly love them equally."
49:48;49:50;"I feel equally connected to them."
49:50;49:53;"And sometimes I'm a bad judge at telling"
49:53;49:55;"which Vampire Weekend songs they're gonna read as, like, weird"
49:55;49:56;"and which--I don't know."
49:56;49:57;"Sure, sure."
49:57;49:59;"But I remember just, like, really thinking about it,"
49:59;50:01;"and some people were really all about ""Unbelievers"""
50:01;50:03;"to be like, ""No, 'Don't Lie' has more--"""
50:03;50:05;"Ultimately, I was just like--I just really tried to imagine"
50:05;50:08;"being somebody hearing each of those songs for the first time."
50:08;50:10;"And my vote came down."
50:10;50:12;"I was like, ""No, 'Unbelievers,' it's, like, a little peppier."
50:12;50:15;"It's, like, easier to remember the first time you hear it."""
50:15;50:17;"Again, not, like, a value judgment,"
50:17;50:20;"but choosing singles is just, like, a funny other thing."
50:20;50:21;"So anyway, Harmony Hall--"
50:21;50:23;"Better subject content."
50:23;50:24;"Yeah, debatably, but no, probably."
50:24;50:25;"No, not at all."
50:25;50:27;"Yeah, ""Unbelievers"" versus ""Don't Lie."""
50:27;50:28;"But even on this, it's, like--"
50:28;50:31;"Well, and also the truth is, it's always kind of cool"
50:31;50:33;"because to us, we work so hard on Harmony Hall."
50:33;50:35;"It's this long, epic song with a guitar solo"
50:35;50:36;"and all these things."
50:36;50:37;"So again--"
50:37;50:39;"It is a miracle that that song was the first song that came out."
50:39;50:41;"No, so also, like, one step further"
50:41;50:43;"versus what you're saying, when we would say, like,"
50:43;50:45;"""Oh, we thought 'How Long' would probably be the single,"""
50:45;50:48;"honestly, if we had played this record for everybody,"
50:48;50:50;"you know, management, all the people we work with,"
50:50;50:52;"and everybody had been like,"
50:52;50:54;"""That Harmony Hall song's a bit of a handful."
50:54;50:55;"Maybe you should consider cutting that down"
50:55;50:56;"or cutting it entirely."""
50:56;50:58;"I like ""How Long."" Let's lead with that."
50:58;51:00;"That actually would have felt uneasy."
51:00;51:01;"I was kind of psyched that everybody was like,"
51:01;51:02;"""Let's do Harmony Hall."""
51:02;51:03;"I was like, ""All right."""
51:03;51:04;"I agree with you, 'cause we worked--"
51:04;51:06;"Don't want to admit it, but we worked harder on Harmony Hall"
51:06;51:07;"than we've done ""How Long."""
51:07;51:09;"Well, in terms of hours spent, absolutely."
51:09;51:10;"Yeah."
51:10;51:12;"There's, like, a way of thinking, too."
51:12;51:15;"That's when you truly are just, like, being by the metrics"
51:15;51:16;"where you're like, ""You know, it's funny."
51:16;51:18;"I'm looking at the numbers now."
51:18;51:20;"So Harmony Hall's 5 minutes, 8 seconds,"
51:20;51:24;"and then 'How Long' is 3 minutes, 32 seconds."""
51:24;51:27;"Like, the definition of, like, a good length for a pop song."
51:27;51:28;"That might have been part of it, too."
51:28;51:30;"Like, it just naturally ended up on that length,"
51:30;51:32;"and you're like, ""This is obviously, like,"
51:32;51:34;"gonna go down easier than Harmony Hall."""
51:34;51:35;"Right."
51:35;51:36;"Not the case."
51:36;51:37;"Well, we'll see what the fans say."
51:37;51:39;"But again, it's like, now it's an album."
51:39;51:41;"Now we've made it through the singles phase."
51:41;51:43;"Well, that's not entirely true, 'cause obviously, like,"
51:43;51:46;"you hope that individual songs will still do their thing,"
51:46;51:49;"but as far as I'm concerned, that's other people's problem."
51:49;51:51;"It's like, now we're in the album phase."
51:51;51:53;"It's like, all the songs are equal."
51:53;51:56;"Track 7, you know this one."
51:56;52:02;"Big time."
52:02;52:04;"You didn't love this song when we first played it for you,"
52:04;52:05;"I remember."
52:05;52:06;"Really?"
52:06;52:07;"Yeah."
52:07;52:08;"Huh."
52:08;52:09;"Broke my spirit a little bit."
52:09;52:10;"Really?"
52:10;52:11;"S***, it's all right, man."
52:11;52:12;"No, it happens."
52:12;52:13;"What did I say?"
52:13;52:14;"This song 100% is a lot of people's, like,"
52:14;52:15;"top 3 on the album."
52:15;52:16;"It's not for everybody, maybe."

01:00:55;01:00:57;"what made me want this to be a double album"

01:01:36;01:01:38;"He's no longer alive, but it was cool"

01:01:42;01:01:44;"It ends up that his son is in charge,"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"and his son was, like, super cool and psyched,"

01:06:49;01:06:50;"- But it's funny too."
01:06:50;01:06:51;"It's like, you know,"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"when people tell me like a song like that,"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"like I think that could be a single,"
01:06:54;01:06:55;"I always just have to say like,"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"""Listen, I love that song,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"but in what universe is it a single?"""
01:06:58;01:07:01;"And I never sweat it too much because--"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"- We could have changed the game if that was a single."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"- I mean, I don't understand what you're asking."
01:07:04;01:07:05;"In what universe is that a single?"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"It's like--"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- Old Town Road, Marion and Gold Rush."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"- 2021 is a single?"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"Like, that's a trip."
01:07:10;01:07:12;"- No, but 2021's not a single."
01:07:12;01:07:12;"That was the--"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"- Like a B-side kind of."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"- Yeah, I hate singing B-side 'cause it's on the album,"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"but it's, yeah, it's the B-side to the Harmony Hall single."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"- I mean--"
01:07:19;01:07:20;"- Sunflower was a kind of--"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"- That's a classic song right there."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- Left Turn, no, this is one of my favorite songs."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"I think I also got a tiny--"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"- It's a classic."
01:07:26;01:07:27;"- I got a tiny bit insecure."
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Again, I won't name names,"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"but there's just like a couple of people"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I played that to in the early days."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"Nobody hated on it, but some people,"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"I think because that one deals with certain like classic"
01:07:37;01:07:40;"kind of country images,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"I think some people on first listen can't see past it."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"So some people say,"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"""You're talking about Midnight Train, Gold Rush."""
01:07:47;01:07:50;"And especially shout out to Dave Maklovich"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"'cause he was kind of like my lyrics edit."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Obviously, Ariel was involved too,"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"but Dave, I'd like really pour over the lyrics with him."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"And I felt like we really worked"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"'cause when I first wrote it, I was like,"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"I got this unplugged electric I could play."
01:08:02;01:08:05;"(electric guitar music)"

01:08:17;01:08:19;"I was so stupid, I couldn't figure out the chorus."
01:08:19;01:08:23;"So at first I always went, ♪ I don't wanna hear it, baby ♪"

01:08:32;01:08:34;"And then I was like,"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"what's the answer to that question, who's your daddy?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"I was just like, where is this going?"
01:08:38;01:08:38;"So I had to reign it in."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And I really, I don't wanna go too into detail."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"I want people to come up with their own interpretations,"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"but this song does hold up to my rigorous standards"
01:08:46;01:08:47;"for song writing. - Oh, that's a relief."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"So anyway, I think like, you know,"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"once you get past some of the imagery,"
01:08:50;01:08:51;"Midnight Train, whatever,"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"that's not really what it's about."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"The story is underneath it."
01:08:54;01:08:57;"But anyway, I think I played the song for a couple people"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"and some people loved it the first time they heard it"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"and some people were kind of like,"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"okay, oh, that's like your country song?"
01:09:02;01:09:03;"And I swear, we pulled our hair out"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"trying to make sure the song didn't sound too country."
01:09:06;01:09:06;"- It doesn't."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"- Yeah, but, and again, it's also like,"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"of course, like country duets is a huge influence on this."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"I think the line to me that's the most,"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"I realize now that I misquoted this"

01:09:29;01:09:30;"It maybe isn't the deepest one,"

01:09:47;01:09:49;"we're recording this two and a half weeks"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"before the album comes out."
01:09:51;01:09:54;"So I'm curious if it'll be a consensus pick,"
01:09:54;01:09:55;"or if some people will be like,"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"weirded out by how different, I don't know."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"- I thought it was fascinating production-wise."
01:10:00;01:10:04;"It is like, such a classic sounding song."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"And then like, there were like, occasionally like,"
01:10:06;01:10:10;"hints towards like a honky-tonk piano or something."
01:10:10;01:10:13;"But then the rest of the production was so not that."
01:10:13;01:10:14;"- It was cool."
01:10:14;01:10:18;"Was it tough, Arielle, to figure that out?"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Seems like it was."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"- We just played with it, you know,"

01:10:36;01:10:37;"No, that-- - E major."
01:10:37;01:10:39;"- B minor, and then E major,"

01:21:12;01:21:12;"- Damn."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"- That's the most metal Vampire Weekend's ever gotten"
01:21:14;01:21:17;"with a double bass drum pedal."
01:21:17;01:21:17;"- Really?"
01:21:20;01:21:21;"- I thought that should be the single too."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"- Are you serious?"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"- Dead ass."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"- Wow."
01:21:26;01:21:30;"- To me it just sounds like normal alternative rock"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"in the coolest way."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"- But that should be the single then?"
01:21:32;01:21:33;"- Yeah."
01:21:33;01:21:36;"Oh, because it's normal alternative rock."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"No, I mean, I just meant like it,"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"well, doesn't have like the pop sensibility that"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"but the other ones do."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"I mean, it's cool, but it's like,"
01:21:45;01:21:49;"it reminds me of like deep, deep on a John Lennon album."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"And I mean that in like the greatest way."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"I love it."
01:21:53;01:21:57;"Like a deep cut off like mind games."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"- Track nine on mind games."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"- Yeah, dude."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"- Well, it is track what?"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"- This is track 11."
01:22:04;01:22:05;"- It's a cool register for your voice."
01:22:05;01:22:07;"- It's a deep cut on FOTV."
01:22:07;01:22:10;"- That's actually one where I do find the impulse to solo"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"because I do love in the minor mode"
01:22:12;01:22:15;"where I've been like messing around a little bit"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"when we've been playing in the rehearsal,"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"but like, I just love that."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"(guitar playing)"
01:22:20;01:22:30;"- Very Spanish and also very Jewish."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"- It might just be on like-"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"- What scale is that?"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"- It's a harmonic minor."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"- Okay."
01:22:38;01:22:45;"Yeah, I just got back from a Passover Seder,"
01:22:45;01:22:50;"a lot of the songs live in that mode."
01:22:50;01:22:55;"- Spanish, Jewish, Middle Eastern, East, whatever it is."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"It's the-"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"- Also like a little bit of Bach."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"Like that."
01:23:05;01:23:06;"- Well, yeah, sure."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"The truth is this mode, people use it all over the place."
01:23:08;01:23:12;"I mean, maybe on acoustic guitar, it just sounds Spanish."
01:23:12;01:23:16;"- You should crush those solos live."
01:23:16;01:23:19;"What's that one called?"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"- Sympathy."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"- Okay."
01:23:21;01:23:25;"- Now we got that sympathy."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"What I'm to you, you are to me, let's go."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"That's gonna be fun live."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"- Yeah."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"- So sympathy into..."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"- Nice."
01:23:33;01:23:37;"- This is my favorite guitar riff to play."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"- Do you know who Taylor Parks is?"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"- Oh, Danielle told me she's-"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"- She wrote ""Thank U, Next"" by Ariana Grande."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"- She's obsessed with this song."
01:23:48;01:23:48;"- Oh yeah, Danielle says-"
01:23:48;01:23:52;"- Apparently her and Anderson .Paak did like a video."
01:23:52;01:23:56;"They've done a video cover of this song,"
01:23:56;01:23:57;"but they haven't released it."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"They haven't, she hasn't like finished this."

01:25:43;01:25:44;"- He must have said something, right?"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"- Thinking Jerry Garcia, I was like, ""You know, man,"

01:26:02;01:26:03;"- He was right there."
01:26:03;01:26:09;"- No, Seinfeld didn't, we were just talking"
01:26:09;01:26:10;"about all sorts of other stuff."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"You know, like on a video shoot,"

01:26:34;01:26:35;"- I just saw him."
01:26:35;01:26:40;"- Steve was like a tiny baby when Seinfeld was on the air."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Or maybe Steve didn't even cross over with Seinfeld."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"The Steve Lacey and Seinfeld crossover at all?"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"- Steve was born the year Seinfeld ended."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"- Did they cross over at all or is it off there?"
01:26:49;01:26:50;"This is a true number crunch."
01:26:50;01:26:53;"I need Steve Lacey's birthday number crunched"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"with the final date of the last episode of Seinfeld."
01:26:56;01:27:00;"- All right, Steve Lacey, born May 23rd, '98."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"- Okay."
01:27:01;01:27:01;"- Oh, this is gonna be close."
01:27:01;01:27:05;"- Series finale of Seinfeld, May 14th, 1998."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"- Oh, two weeks before he's born."
01:27:07;01:27:10;"- Wait, so Steve Lacey is literally Seinfeld"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"the TV show reincarnated."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"- Yeah."
01:27:12;01:27:14;"- So they didn't cross over at all?"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"- No crossover, week later, nine days later."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"- Days between."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"- The days between."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"(laughing)"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"Vampire Week and Richard Pictures present Days Between."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"It's a two week festival every year"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"on the Ventura County play--"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"- Fairgrounds."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"- At the Ventura County Fairgrounds."
01:27:31;01:27:34;"We set up shop for two weeks to celebrate"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"those two weeks on earth between Seinfeld ending"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"and Steve Lacey being born."
01:27:38;01:27:40;"We'll be playing all the greatest hits."
01:27:40;01:27:42;"We'll be playing the Steve Lacey songs,"
01:27:42;01:27:45;"songs by the internet, the Seinfeld theme."
01:27:45;01:27:49;"We'll be view, the only time Steve Lacey"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"and Jerry Seinfeld were in the same room"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"was at the Sunflower video shoot."
01:27:51;01:27:54;"So we'll have the Sunflower video on rotation."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"No, Steve kept it real with Jerry, which was awesome"
01:27:56;01:27:59;"'cause he was like super psyched to meet him."
01:27:59;01:28:00;"And of course he knew who he was,"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"but Steve was like, said to him like,"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"you know, I've gotta be honest,"
01:28:02;01:28:06;"like I grew up like after Seinfeld was on TV."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"I've never really seen it."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"And so Jerry was kind of like, oh,"
01:28:08;01:28:11;"and then Steve was like, but I have seen B movie"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"and that's a great movie."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"And yeah, it was like, it was cool."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"He showed him love and he, 'cause he,"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"Steve was probably the right age for B movie."
01:28:16;01:28:19;"- He probably doesn't get that a lot, Jerry."
01:28:19;01:28:20;"- Yeah, no--"
01:28:20;01:28:21;"- Steve Seinfeld, but love B."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- And I think Jerry was happy."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"He was like, oh, that's cool."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"That's different."
01:28:26;01:28:26;"- Deep cut."
01:28:26;01:28:28;"- So you impressed Jerry."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"- Yeah."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Also the truth is like, if I met,"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"well, I haven't been around long enough,"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"but if I met like a 12 year old who's like,"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"oh, I love Harmony Hall."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"And I'd be like, oh, that's sick."
01:28:38;01:28:38;"And they're like, I'll be honest,"
01:28:38;01:28:42;"I don't really know your first few albums"
01:28:42;01:28:43;"because I was a tiny little kid."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"I wasn't even alive."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"That's what you wanna hear is that you're,"
01:28:46;01:28:50;"the work you continue to do connects with people."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"You know, that's why you make B movie post Seinfeld."
01:28:52;01:28:53;"- Might be more like someone saying,"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"I love Neo Yokio, I don't know anything"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"about Vampire Weekend."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"- That happened once."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"No, this is--"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- That's tight."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"- This is borderline, although--"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"- And that's like your TC heads that--"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"- That you don't really (beep) with VDog."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"- Are not fans of the band."
01:29:05;01:29:06;"- Yeah."
01:29:06;01:29:06;"(laughing)"
01:29:06;01:29:07;"No, that happened, I don't know, Ariel,"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"if you saw that, but you, I don't think you were here"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"for that episode, but we're just like thinking out loud,"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"do you think there's anybody who's like a true TC head"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"who doesn't really like Vampire Weekend?"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"And we just kinda put it out there and we're like,"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"hey, if there's any fans, and some people started tweeting"
01:29:21;01:29:25;"at Seinfeld and there were like a few people just being like,"
01:29:25;01:29:28;"and Seinfeld was a little defensive, which I appreciated,"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"but I had to clear the air with, like one person was like,"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"hey, I'll be honest, like never been really a fan"
01:29:32;01:29:35;"of the band, but like I got into TC and I'm really into it."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"And I was kinda like, we asked, and that's cool."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"I respect it."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"- I dropped a weird flex, but okay."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"- Right."
01:29:42;01:29:42;"- 'Cause I forgot we asked."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"- Oh, right."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"- Yeah, I just saw that, about weird flex."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"- Like, who the (beep) cares?"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Shut the (beep) up."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"But anyway."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"(laughing)"
01:29:53;01:29:56;"- That's the funniest flex, not into vampire."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"Love the show."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"- Out of context."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"- No, but I love that."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"But with Neo Yokio, I mean, Neo Yokio's an even more"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"like specific weird thing."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"- That is, yeah."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"- So I swear, I know it sounds made up,"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"even as I said, it seems weird,"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"but this was a true sequence of events that happened."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"I'm in a hotel in New York, and a guy gets in the elevator"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"and he's like kinda looking at me."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"And then as I'm getting to my floor,"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"he like quickly, like, goes in bed,"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"and he goes, ""Hey, by the way, you Ezra?"""
01:30:23;01:30:24;"And I'm like, ""Yeah."""
01:30:24;01:30:27;"And he goes, ""You're the guy who made the Neo Yokio, right?"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"""The show with Jaden?"""
01:30:28;01:30:29;"I'm like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah."""
01:30:29;01:30:30;"And he was like, ""I love that show."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"""When's it coming back?"""
01:30:31;01:30:33;"And I said, ""Well, you know, to be honest,"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"""like, I'm pretty tied up with like"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"""the next Vampire Weekend album,"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"""and you know, Jaden's doing all this music stuff too,"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"""so, you know, I don't know."""
01:30:40;01:30:42;"And I was like, ""But you know, it's the kind of thing"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"""we'd love, you know, it's so much fun."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"""We could totally dip back into it in the future"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"""one way or another."""
01:30:46;01:30:47;"And he was like, ""Oh, cool."""
01:30:47;01:30:49;"And I was like, ""Anyway, have a good one, get out."""
01:30:49;01:30:52;"And then a week or two later, I got,"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"it's so bizarre to me, I got a DM from the dude"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"that was so specific that said,"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"""Hey, you might not remember me."
01:30:59;01:31:03;"""I'm the guy who talked to you about Neo Yokio"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"""in the hotel elevator."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"""Listen, I hope I didn't seem disrespectful,"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"""but when you told me that you weren't gonna be working"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"""on Neo Yokio for a while because your band"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"""was putting out an album,"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"""I was pretty disappointed."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"""And I hope it didn't come across as rude."""
01:31:17;01:31:19;"And I was like, ""What?"""
01:31:19;01:31:21;"And then he goes, ""But you know, however,"
01:31:21;01:31:24;"""after that conversation, I looked up your band"
01:31:24;01:31:25;"""and I looked up some of your music,"
01:31:25;01:31:28;"""and I gotta say, like, your new single,"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"""Harmony Hall, is great, and I'm looking forward"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"""to checking out the rest of your music."""
01:31:31;01:31:32;"And I was just kind of like, ""Whoa."""
01:31:32;01:31:34;"That one was weird to me that--"
01:31:34;01:31:37;"- Well, he recognized you."
01:31:37;01:31:40;"So he must have recognized you from the context of Vampire."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"- I feel like it was probably--"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"- I don't know."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"- He recognized him from an article"
01:31:44;01:31:47;"that had his face in it about Neo Yokio."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"- If you were a Neo Yokio head,"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"you would've looked it up a little bit more."
01:31:51;01:31:53;"You would've seen Ezra's picture and Jaden's picture."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- Or Jaden Smith's Instagram, maybe."
01:31:54;01:31:55;"- Okay."
01:31:55;01:31:58;"- If you're a Neo Yokio head who hates Vampire"
01:31:58;01:31:59;"and hates TC--"
01:31:59;01:32:00;"(laughing)"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"- But are listening to it right now."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"- If you're a deep, you're a true Neo--"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"- The one album where I'm like deep on Vampire Weekend."
01:32:06;01:32:07;"- On TC."
01:32:07;01:32:09;"- You're a Neo Yokio head who's hate listening"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"to this episode of TC."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"We wanna hear from you."
01:32:13;01:32:14;"What's your deal, man?"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"And again, I hope it doesn't come across"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"as like an ego thing because trust me,"
01:32:18;01:32:21;"I would truly be happy to never be stopped or recognized."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"But yeah, I was just kinda like,"
01:32:23;01:32:27;"this dude knew my name, said what's up to me."
01:32:27;01:32:28;"Well, I guess it's not like he said,"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"""I didn't know that you were a musician."""
01:32:30;01:32:32;"He might've at least known that part."
01:32:32;01:32:35;"But he truly had not particularly spent time"
01:32:35;01:32:36;"listening to Vampire Weekend."
01:32:36;01:32:39;"But I just love the vibe of being like,"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"I hope I was not rude in my disappointment"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"to hear that you were working on music rather than--"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"- Yeah."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"- So yeah, there have been people popped up here and there."
01:32:48;01:32:53;"So anyway, shout out to Seinfeld and Steve Lacey."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"We've been working on some fun live versions of Sunflower."
01:32:56;01:32:59;"We have this one that gets almost kinda like stoner rock."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"(imitates guitar)"
01:33:02;01:33:08;"And then we did kinda, at first when we'd kinda start"

01:39:44;01:39:48;"- And then like mishear advertisements,"
01:39:48;01:39:49;"and like start writing them down as lyrics."
01:39:49;01:39:50;"- Oh, that's cool."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"- Or start playing the music with the ad,"
01:39:52;01:39:53;"and like that turns into a song."

01:43:36;01:43:40;"- It's kind of two different songs that came together,"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"as is often the case with Vampire Weekend."
01:43:42;01:43:46;"So we had this old demo that started with, you know,"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"the drums he programmed and Rossum having that 12 string."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"(guitar playing)"
01:43:52;01:43:57;"And then I wrote, I can't even play it,"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"it's too high, up an octave."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"(guitar playing)"
01:44:01;01:44:07;"So we had that, and then I had this song"
01:44:07;01:44:10;"I kind of play at piano where I always wanted to do a song"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"that was like insanely simple,"
01:44:12;01:44:15;"that was just listing things that go together."
01:44:15;01:44:16;"So I'd sit at the piano and go like,"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"♪ We go together like pots and pans ♪"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"♪ Bottles and cans, bottles and mines ♪"
01:44:22;01:44:23;"♪ We go together ♪"
01:44:23;01:44:27;"Just like, ♪ Oh, we go together ♪"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Then we kind of mashed them up."
01:44:29;01:44:31;"- No use in being clever."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"- Yeah, I think-- - That's a good line."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"- Yeah, I think that's kind of what ties the song together."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"Maybe, or maybe I just wanted to put a caveat"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"that this is a song about realizing,"
01:44:40;01:44:41;"can't be that clever."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"Although there's a lot of lines that I like in this,"
01:44:44;01:44:47;"like also in the vein of like,"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"some like funny old country duets is,"
01:44:49;01:44:53;"♪ We go together like bows and plates ♪"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"Oh, Keats and Yates."
01:44:55;01:44:56;"I just thought that was funny"
01:44:56;01:44:58;"'cause they're two literary names that don't rhyme,"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"look like they should."
01:44:59;01:45:01;"♪ We go together like Keats and Yates ♪"
01:45:01;01:45:02;"♪ Days and dates, bows and plates ♪"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"And then this is my favorite."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"♪ We stay united like these are states ♪"
01:45:07;01:45:11;"♪ It's how we go together ♪"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"- You know, it's funny, I was struggling with"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"deciding whether the song maintained"
01:45:15;01:45:18;"your rigorous, logical continuity."
01:45:18;01:45:22;"Well, I couldn't tell initially if the song was ironic"
01:45:22;01:45:23;"and that you were listing things"
01:45:23;01:45:24;"that actually didn't go together."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"Like, what are the opening lines?"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"- Some of the things don't go together."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"- Yeah, like some of them are like absolute enemies."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Lions and lambs?"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"- Well, the lion lies down to the lamb."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"- Oh, I thought the lion was just gonna rip the lamb apart."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"- Well, lions and lambs-- - I don't know the Bible,"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"so that's lost on me."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"But no, but there were some that were like--"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"- Well, hold on, you really should, Jake."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"No, you're right, well, that part of--"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"- Avowed atheist over here."
01:45:46;01:45:49;"- Part of the, no, part of the song was at a certain point,"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"I was like, it's more interesting if,"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"well, that also gets into some philosophical (beep)"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"obviously, like, that things that go together go together,"
01:45:57;01:46:00;"but so do opposites go together."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"We can't shut up about how opposite they are,"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"we put them together."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"You know, like-- - Opposites attract,"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"look at Paul Abdul and--"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"- The cat, the cat man."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Yeah, I'm saying like, there's things that don't go together"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"like, you know, like to quote that line,"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"a fish and a bicycle,"
01:46:16;01:46:17;"they don't have nothing to do with each other,"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"but then if you start to be like,"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"you know, pedestrians and cars,"
01:46:21;01:46:22;"in some ways they're opposites, but they go together."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Yeah, so there's some stuff like,"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"what doesn't go together?"
01:46:25;01:46:28;"♪ We go together like sound and sight ♪"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"♪ Days and night, black and white ♪"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"♪ We go together like left and right ♪"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"♪ Oh, we ♪"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Yeah, so there's some that are like on the"
01:46:36;01:46:39;"pots and pans, surf and sand, bottles and cans."
01:46:39;01:46:42;"And then I think also that-- - Left and right."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"(laughs)"
01:46:43;01:46:44;"- Left and right goes together."
01:46:44;01:46:47;"- Jake's calling bull (beep)"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I'm not calling bull (beep)"
01:46:49;01:46:50;"but it was interesting to hear it out of the gate"
01:46:50;01:46:53;"and just be like, I can't actually decide"
01:46:53;01:46:56;"if this is like, completely ironic,"
01:46:56;01:46:59;"like he's listing things that don't go together."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"Eventually I got it."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"And it's like a very,"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"it's probably the most wholesome Vampire Weekend song."
01:47:06;01:47:09;"Yeah, well, perhaps, yeah."
01:47:09;01:47:11;"- Sweet tune towards the end of the album."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Yeah, warm your heart."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"♪ We go together ♪"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"Harry Nilsson would have loved it."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- But then at the end there's also the part that goes,"
01:47:17;01:47:22;"♪ Hallelujah, you're still mine ♪"
01:47:22;01:47:28;"♪ All I did was waste your time ♪"
01:47:28;01:47:33;"♪ If there's not some grand design ♪"
01:47:34;01:47:39;"♪ I'd hide this pair of stars aligned ♪"
01:47:39;01:47:43;"- So I think there's a few ways to interpret it."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"And I think also the song is very contextualized"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"by the rest of the album, which I won't go into,"
01:47:46;01:47:50;"but people can think what they think about that."
01:47:50;01:47:52;"But I also, just like on some basic level,"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"when I was trying to apply that rigorous logic to the song,"
01:47:55;01:47:58;"I did kind of picture, as is often the case,"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"like the narrator of the song being like"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"a little bit of a goofball"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"and like just making a hard sell to somebody"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"about why you go together."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"When people try to make a case for something,"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"they'll literally pull anything out."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"We go together 'cause we're similar."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Not buying that?"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Well, the opposite's tracked."
01:48:14;01:48:14;"You know what I mean?"
01:48:14;01:48:15;"Like if somebody's making a hard case,"
01:48:15;01:48:18;"they'll literally say contradictory things."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"So then I like that in the chorus,"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"it's the person's kind of like,"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"or they're both singing to each other in this song,"
01:48:24;01:48:27;"it's the truth, that is also kind of saying like,"
01:48:27;01:48:28;"eh, they're almost getting defeated."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"There's no use in being clever."
01:48:30;01:48:32;"I could try to come up with all these reasons,"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"it doesn't mean anything."
01:48:33;01:48:36;"I can try to prove to you with rigorous logic"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"why we belong together."
01:48:38;01:48:38;"And then I think the--"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"- I can cite countless examples."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"- I think the end kind of puts a fine point on it,"
01:48:43;01:48:46;"where it's like, okay, you know, oh, you're still mine."
01:48:46;01:48:48;"I was just a jealous guy or something."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"I was just wasting your time"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"by freaking out about this stuff."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"And maybe there is no grand design,"
01:48:52;01:48:55;"just like sometimes stars align, it's as simple as that."
01:48:55;01:48:56;"There's not always an answer."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"That's my interpretation today"
01:48:58;01:49:02;"of why this song holds up to my rigorous logic."
01:49:02;01:49:05;"- I know there's probably a lot of top five people"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"saying, oh, new Vampire Weekend song out,"
01:49:07;01:49:09;"maybe an Ed Sheeran."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"These guys have been doing close reads of my lyrics,"
01:49:11;01:49:15;"I would say respectfully in his case, for years."
01:49:15;01:49:18;"Getting all crazy about my word choice, bed sheets."
01:49:18;01:49:19;"- Yep."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"- Let's see what this moron has going on under the hood."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"- They're about to turn the fire hose back on you."
01:49:25;01:49:31;"- You're listening to Ed Sheeran Radio"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"and our donkey of the week."
01:49:33;01:49:37;"- Yeah, Ed should get a beat show."
01:49:37;01:49:38;"- That'd be sick."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"- Just do deep lyrical analysis."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"- That was a--"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"- So what track are we on here?"
01:49:43;01:49:43;"We are--"
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- That was track 15."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"- We are rounding third."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"- We're in the home stretch."

01:51:30;01:51:33;"- Not a single, just a deep album cut."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"- Could be a single."

02:00:17;02:00:18;"- Well, that's the album."
02:00:18;02:00:21;"(all clapping)"
02:00:22;02:00:24;"- Slow clap."
02:00:24;02:00:25;"That's a great last song."
02:00:25;02:00:26;"- Yeah, that was always like,"
02:00:26;02:00:29;"kind of the only true contender for the final track."
02:00:29;02:00:32;"- I like how much piano is on this album."
02:00:32;02:00:33;"- It's funny. - Especially towards the end."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"- I think of it as such a guitar album"
02:00:35;02:00:38;"'cause there's just more guitar riffs than the last album,"
02:00:38;02:00:39;"but you're right, there's a ton of piano too."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"- Yeah."
02:00:40;02:00:42;"- 'Cause the last album truly had no guitar riffs"
02:00:42;02:00:44;"and this has like, Harmony Hall and Sunflower"
02:00:44;02:00:45;"and you know, I'm Very White."
02:00:45;02:00:47;"- Stranger, Killer Part, I mean."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"- Stranger."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"- Oh yeah, Jake, we got multiple guitarists."
02:00:50;02:00:51;"Jake, John."
02:00:51;02:00:53;"- I'm crushing it on there, John's crushing it."
02:00:53;02:00:56;"- At this point, I don't know how deep I wanna go"
02:00:56;02:00:58;"on the album, it's only been out for two days."
02:00:58;02:01:01;"I want people to spend time with it."
02:01:01;02:01:02;"- I just think we went pretty deep."
02:01:02;02:01:04;"- No, we went deep, but it's like,"
02:01:04;02:01:06;"especially when you're doing like press and stuff,"
02:01:06;02:01:08;"people ask you like, about songs,"
02:01:08;02:01:09;"you always have a choice."
02:01:09;02:01:12;"You could really say everything you've thought"
02:01:12;02:01:14;"or everything that's been on your mind,"
02:01:14;02:01:16;"every possible interpretation, you know?"
02:01:16;02:01:19;"And that always strikes me as unnecessary,"
02:01:19;02:01:21;"even in the press that I've done on this album,"
02:01:21;02:01:22;"occasionally I'll be talking to somebody"
02:01:22;02:01:25;"and they'll have an interpretation of a song"
02:01:25;02:01:27;"and I'll basically say, yeah, that's a valid interpretation,"
02:01:27;02:01:29;"it doesn't mean that I, I say like, that's what it means."
02:01:29;02:01:32;"And then some, it'll still end up being like,"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"end up in an article and then another article saying like,"
02:01:34;02:01:36;"oh, there's a lyric about this or something."
02:01:36;02:01:39;"I also just hope that it's human nature a little bit,"
02:01:39;02:01:40;"but I always feel like a lot of people,"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"be listening to a record and be like, yeah, you know,"
02:01:42;02:01:45;"it got like, the first half was just way stronger."
02:01:45;02:01:47;"But it kind of lost me in the second half."
02:01:47;02:01:49;"And some records are legitimately like that,"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"but there's also, you always have to check yourself."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"You're like, you know, your attention span"
02:01:53;02:01:55;"probably like ran out of gas in the second half."
02:01:55;02:01:56;"- Sure."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"- I think the second half is just as strong as the first."
02:01:58;02:02:01;"I know the 18 song album, it's a lot to take in."
02:02:01;02:02:02;"I just hope people like, you know,"
02:02:02;02:02:05;"you listen through it all at once, that's cool."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"But then, you know, go spend some time"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"with the back half on its own."
02:02:08;02:02:09;"It's a double album, you know?"
02:02:09;02:02:10;"- Strong finish."
02:02:10;02:02:12;"- Yeah, and I like the middle too."
02:02:12;02:02:14;"We got ""Unbearably White"" into ""Rich Man"""
02:02:14;02:02:17;"into ""Married in a Gold Rush"" into ""My Mistake"","
02:02:17;02:02:18;"all like relatively slow songs,"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"but they're some of my favorite songs."
02:02:20;02:02:22;"Then you're also like, oh, are people just gonna be like,"
02:02:22;02:02:25;"the energy really lagged in the middle."
02:02:25;02:02:27;"Like, those are some of the best songs, whatever."
02:02:27;02:02:28;"Different strokes."
02:02:28;02:02:31;"- Yeah, can't write A-punk every year."
02:02:31;02:02:33;"- Yeah, an album of A-punks."
02:02:33;02:02:35;"- You'd be a pop-punk band."
02:02:35;02:02:39;"- Yeah, A-punk, B-punk, C-punk, D-punk."
02:02:39;02:02:41;"I'm curious after you've spent some real time"
02:02:41;02:02:44;"with the album, Jake, what your top five are on the record."
02:02:44;02:02:45;"Do you have a gut feeling now?"
02:02:45;02:02:46;"- I will get back to you on that."
02:02:46;02:02:47;"- Yeah, you need to spend some time."
02:02:47;02:02:48;"- I'm gonna say ""Harmony""."
02:02:48;02:02:50;"- Still ""Harmony"" going strong."
02:02:50;02:02:51;"- Oh, absolutely."
02:02:51;02:02:53;"(laughs)"
02:02:53;02:02:54;"Geez, I have to look at a track listing."
02:02:54;02:02:57;"I think I'd have to go ""Gold Rush""."
02:02:57;02:02:59;"- Okay, that's two."
02:02:59;02:03:00;"- Three more."
02:03:00;02:03:01;"- I mean, I don't wanna like shortchange things."
02:03:01;02:03:03;"- No, but that's-- - I like the first song."
02:03:03;02:03:04;"- Oh, ""Hold You Now""?"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"- I think that's probably in there."
02:03:06;02:03:07;"- No, I'm glad that you like ""Gold Rush"""
02:03:07;02:03:08;"right off the bat. - It's a little basic,"
02:03:08;02:03:11;"but I wanna say ""Stranger""."
02:03:11;02:03:12;"- No, that's cool."
02:03:12;02:03:13;"- I mean, it's real sugary."
02:03:13;02:03:15;"- Why is that? - Yeah, ""Stranger"" is sweet."
02:03:15;02:03:16;"That's, I felt a little bit insecure"
02:03:16;02:03:17;"about the song. - I feel like it's basic"
02:03:17;02:03:20;"on me, not the song is basic."
02:03:20;02:03:21;"It's basic of me to say ""Stranger""."
02:03:21;02:03:23;"- It has the type of hook that you,"
02:03:23;02:03:25;"it's a very direct hook the first time you think."
02:03:25;02:03:27;"I think there's like, I do think there's some stuff"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"happening under the hood, but it's like, yeah,"
02:03:29;02:03:31;"it comes across as like fun and upbeat."
02:03:31;02:03:32;"- Yeah."
02:03:32;02:03:33;"- It's good if you like it."
02:03:33;02:03:34;"(laughs)"
02:03:34;02:03:37;"- But let's just hold off on my definitive top five."
02:03:37;02:03:38;"- Okay. - That's four though."
02:03:38;02:03:40;"Like right off the bat, what's your fifth?"
02:03:40;02:03:42;"- Geez, well I've--"
02:03:42;02:03:44;"- Should I remind you of something that you like kind of--"
02:03:44;02:03:45;"- Yeah, yeah, remind me of a few."
02:03:45;02:03:47;"- Well, you-- - Your sympathy."
02:03:47;02:03:49;"- You liked ""Rich Man"", you said?"
02:03:49;02:03:50;"- Yeah, I thought of ""Rich Man""."
02:03:50;02:03:51;"- Oh, ""Flower Moon""."
02:03:51;02:03:53;"- You didn't-- - Oh yeah, ""Flower Moon""."
02:03:53;02:03:54;"That's tough, that's, I mean I really like"
02:03:54;02:03:56;"the last two songs on the record too,"
02:03:56;02:03:57;"so I don't know, I've done that."
02:03:57;02:03:58;"- ""Jerusalem""?"
02:03:58;02:04:00;"- I'm really struggling here with this fifth, I can't."
02:04:00;02:04:02;"- Well we know it's not gonna be ""Unbearably White""."
02:04:02;02:04:03;"- Hate that one."
02:04:03;02:04:05;"(laughs)"
02:04:05;02:04:08;"- Hey man, that's why, it's all good, that's why--"
02:04:08;02:04:10;"- Broke my heart when I played you that one originally."
02:04:10;02:04:11;"- We're building-- - Damn, was I just harsh"
02:04:11;02:04:12;"as hell?"
02:04:12;02:04:13;"- No, you were just-- - No."
02:04:14;02:04:15;"- Okay."
02:04:15;02:04:16;"- Jake keeps it real."
02:04:16;02:04:17;"- I'm neutral."
02:04:17;02:04:19;"- You know what, I vividly remember being--"
02:04:19;02:04:19;"- I respect your taste."
02:04:19;02:04:21;"- I vividly remember being in my old apartment in New York"
02:04:21;02:04:25;"and playing you an early demo of ""Unbelievers""."
02:04:25;02:04:25;"- Uh-huh."
02:04:25;02:04:26;"- And I just remember like at the end,"
02:04:26;02:04:28;"I kinda looked at you and just kinda,"
02:04:28;02:04:30;"you almost just did like a, like arms there like,"
02:04:30;02:04:33;"yeah man, it's a song, I don't know,"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"what do you want me to say man?"
02:04:35;02:04:36;"That was good."
02:04:36;02:04:37;"- That's a good one too."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"Must've been a rough demo."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"(laughs)"
02:04:40;02:04:43;"- Wait, is that track two on ""Vampire""?"
02:04:43;02:04:44;"Or like--"
02:04:44;02:04:45;"- ""Modern Vampires"", yeah."
02:04:45;02:04:47;"♪ Yeah, see the sun go down ♪"
02:04:47;02:04:48;"♪ It's going on down ♪"
02:04:48;02:04:49;"♪ I'm not excited ♪"
02:04:49;02:04:50;"- Okay."
02:04:50;02:04:52;"- I mean, I could also imagine like--"
02:04:52;02:04:54;"- Sometimes you miss things first time through, you know?"
02:04:54;02:04:55;"- No judgment."
02:04:55;02:04:56;"- Yeah."
02:04:56;02:04:57;"- No, no, and I love playing music for you"
02:04:57;02:04:58;"because you are a straight shooter."
02:04:58;02:05:00;"Like, you're never like overly harsh."
02:05:00;02:05:02;"I never have to be like, well, I don't know,"
02:05:02;02:05:04;"was Jake just trying to like put that song down?"
02:05:04;02:05:06;"Like that's not, that's not your vibe."
02:05:06;02:05:08;"So I'm always interested, if something jumps out at you--"
02:05:08;02:05:10;"- Is Jake in a real bad mood today?"
02:05:10;02:05:11;"- Jake is just--"
02:05:11;02:05:13;"- I was just being a dick about stuff."
02:05:13;02:05:15;"- Jake was just laying into me."
02:05:15;02:05:16;"- You need to get something to eat, man."
02:05:16;02:05:17;"You're in a real bad mood about this song."
02:05:17;02:05:20;"- Can you blow blood sugar right now, man?"
02:05:20;02:05:21;"- Sucks."
02:05:21;02:05:23;"- I really don't like the way you reacted."
02:05:23;02:05:25;"- Just intense text drama, like,"
02:05:25;02:05:28;"dude, that really (beep) bummed me out when you rolled it."
02:05:28;02:05:29;"- Bro, I'm gonna keep it real with you"
02:05:29;02:05:30;"because you're my friend."
02:05:30;02:05:32;"We've been buddies for a long time."
02:05:32;02:05:34;"This new song ""Unbelievers"", dog (beep)"
02:05:34;02:05:36;"(laughs)"
02:05:36;02:05:38;"And a lot of people aren't gonna tell you that, man,"
02:05:38;02:05:39;"but I keep it real."
02:05:39;02:05:40;"(laughs)"
02:05:40;02:05:41;"- Straight shooter."
02:05:41;02:05:43;"- No, but I could see like an early version"
02:05:43;02:05:46;"of ""Unbelievers"" maybe where it just like,"
02:05:46;02:05:48;"maybe on first listen sounds like too simple"
02:05:48;02:05:49;"or too straight up."
02:05:49;02:05:50;"- Yeah, I don't remember that."
02:05:50;02:05:51;"- Da da da da da da, I don't know."
02:05:51;02:05:52;"- I don't remember that at all."
02:05:52;02:05:54;"- That song grew a bit as we worked on it and like with--"
02:05:54;02:05:56;"- That's a great one."
02:05:56;02:05:58;"- No, yeah, that's an all-time record."
02:05:58;02:05:59;"- I think we played those at the Bernie rounds."
02:05:59;02:06:01;"- Oh yeah, yeah, we did."
02:06:01;02:06:03;"I know myself, first listen,"
02:06:03;02:06:04;"if I really like something first listen,"
02:06:04;02:06:06;"that is meaningful."
02:06:06;02:06:08;"It probably means it is gonna be one of my favorites,"
02:06:08;02:06:11;"but just because something I don't connect first time"
02:06:11;02:06:12;"definitely doesn't mean--"
02:06:12;02:06:13;"- Oh no."
02:06:13;02:06:14;"- It won't crawl up there."
02:06:14;02:06:15;"- Some of your favorite songs are the ones"
02:06:15;02:06:16;"you hear them for the first time"
02:06:16;02:06:18;"and you're like, ""What is this?"""
02:06:18;02:06:19;"- Right."
02:06:19;02:06:19;"- You know, then they grow on you."
02:06:19;02:06:21;"- Track three didn't like."
02:06:21;02:06:23;"- What was track, oh, ""Bambina""?"
02:06:23;02:06:25;"- He wasn't feeling it, I could tell."
02:06:25;02:06:26;"(laughs)"
02:06:26;02:06:27;"Saw a look in his eyes."
02:06:27;02:06:28;"- Interesting song."
02:06:28;02:06:30;"- This was a mildly uncomfortable taping"
02:06:30;02:06:32;"'cause Ariel was watching me like a hawk."
02:06:32;02:06:35;"(laughs)"
02:06:35;02:06:36;"I would just look across the table"
02:06:36;02:06:37;"and he'd just be staring at me."
02:06:37;02:06:39;"Almost with the same longing"
02:06:39;02:06:41;"that a mother looks at her child."
02:06:41;02:06:43;"He was looking very intensely at me."
02:06:43;02:06:45;"- Just give me something, anything."
02:06:45;02:06:48;"- I just had to poke her face the entire taping."
02:06:48;02:06:50;"- What's going on in there, man?"
02:06:50;02:06:51;"(laughs)"
02:06:51;02:06:52;"Let me in."
02:06:52;02:06:55;"Well, this is also, because we're recording this"
02:06:55;02:06:56;"two and a half weeks before the record's out,"
02:06:56;02:06:58;"this is also a bit of a time capsule,"
02:06:58;02:07:00;"so I guess to wrap things up,"
02:07:00;02:07:02;"we could just say anything that we wanna say"
02:07:02;02:07:03;"before the record comes out"
02:07:03;02:07:05;"and there's all sorts of reactions."
02:07:05;02:07:08;"What are your hopes and dreams?"
02:07:08;02:07:10;"- I think all my hopes and dreams have come true."
02:07:10;02:07:12;"- Oh, I feel you."
02:07:12;02:07:13;"I do have a sense of kinda like--"
02:07:13;02:07:16;"- We made this record for reasons"
02:07:16;02:07:18;"and those reasons were--"
02:07:18;02:07:19;"- All the right reasons."
02:07:19;02:07:21;"- All the right reasons,"
02:07:21;02:07:22;"so you could play it for me."
02:07:22;02:07:23;"- That's right."
02:07:23;02:07:24;"Mission accomplished, tour is canceled."
02:07:24;02:07:28;"- This was the culmination of three years of work."
02:07:28;02:07:30;"- The album is recalled from stores."
02:07:30;02:07:31;"- This episode will never air."
02:07:31;02:07:33;"(laughs)"
02:07:33;02:07:36;"- I kinda feel a little bit like"
02:07:36;02:07:38;"the only thought that I've had,"
02:07:38;02:07:40;"and of course you work on things that you met,"
02:07:40;02:07:41;"how are people gonna react"
02:07:41;02:07:42;"and sometimes you're in a good mood"
02:07:42;02:07:43;"and you're like, oh, I think people will get this"
02:07:43;02:07:44;"and other times you're like,"
02:07:44;02:07:45;"oh, people are gonna have like"
02:07:45;02:07:47;"the most uncharitable interpretations"
02:07:47;02:07:50;"and then the truth is probably somewhere in between."
02:07:50;02:07:52;"The thing that happens every time you put something out,"
02:07:52;02:07:55;"every album, I think the tension is always like,"
02:07:55;02:07:58;"of course, not everything is for everybody."
02:07:58;02:08:00;"Some people are gonna feel passionately positive"
02:08:00;02:08:02;"or negative, you can't help that."
02:08:02;02:08:05;"The only thing that I sometimes wonder is,"
02:08:05;02:08:06;"or you hope that people just give you"
02:08:06;02:08:10;"the benefit of the doubt that any decision you made,"
02:08:10;02:08:11;"you made on purpose."
02:08:11;02:08:14;"Like if you make a song that's like maybe like"
02:08:14;02:08:16;"a little sweet or something"
02:08:16;02:08:18;"and then somebody hears it and is just like,"
02:08:18;02:08:21;"losing all control, they fall head first"
02:08:21;02:08:24;"into a saccharine sentiment and you're just kinda like,"
02:08:24;02:08:25;"no, that's the sentiment I wanted to make."
02:08:25;02:08:27;"You interpret things differently"
02:08:27;02:08:28;"if you give people the benefit of the doubt"
02:08:28;02:08:31;"that they've made decisions on their own."
02:08:31;02:08:33;"Versus other interpretations can be,"
02:08:33;02:08:35;"oh, this person made that decision"
02:08:35;02:08:38;"because they lost the plot."
02:08:38;02:08:40;"One thing I feel very confident about with this record"
02:08:40;02:08:44;"is like, this is 100% the chapter four for Vampire Weekend."
02:08:44;02:08:46;"It's the same way I felt about all the other ones."
02:08:46;02:08:47;"- That's how I felt."
02:08:47;02:08:49;"- There's so many different directions we could have gone in"
02:08:49;02:08:50;"even on the first album."
02:08:50;02:08:52;"And like sometimes you come up with a song"
02:08:52;02:08:53;"and it's not your favorite song of all time."
02:08:53;02:08:56;"Like, I don't know, like a song like California English,"
02:08:56;02:08:57;"like on the second album."
02:08:57;02:08:59;"And I just knew that that felt like"
02:08:59;02:09:00;"a second album song for us."
02:09:00;02:09:01;"It felt like part of Contra."
02:09:01;02:09:03;"You know, then you meet people who,"
02:09:03;02:09:05;"or you know, sometimes I get like a fan tweeting like,"
02:09:05;02:09:08;"I really like that new song, I really don't like that one."
02:09:08;02:09:09;"And I'm just kinda like,"
02:09:09;02:09:12;"what do you think we're doing here, man?"
02:09:12;02:09:14;"We're making a body of work, you know?"
02:09:14;02:09:16;"So all that matters is that like,"
02:09:16;02:09:18;"it doesn't matter which song is anybody's favorite,"
02:09:18;02:09:22;"just matters is that body of work feel like it landed"
02:09:22;02:09:26;"in the place that the next chapter was supposed to go."
02:09:26;02:09:29;"And I think once you have confidence in that, which I do,"
02:09:29;02:09:30;"in some ways it's like,"
02:09:30;02:09:32;"it almost feels like out of your hands."
02:09:32;02:09:34;"I asked a question, which is, where should this go?"
02:09:34;02:09:37;"And I made a series of decisions purposefully to get there."
02:09:37;02:09:39;"And that's all that you can do."

02:10:54;02:10:57;"like the tour was like this kind of like chore"
02:10:57;02:11:00;"that you had to do after like the work."
02:11:00;02:11:02;"And now for the first time, I'm like,"
02:11:02;02:11:03;"when we put together set lists"
02:11:03;02:11:06;"and I kind of see these songs next to the first, second,"
02:11:06;02:11:07;"third albums, next to the deep cuts,"
02:11:07;02:11:10;"it's like, that also brings me a lot of joy too."
02:11:10;02:11:11;"I see the long-term story."
02:11:11;02:11:14;"I also am just glad that I really questioned the instinct"
02:11:14;02:11:17;"to make a double album a lot over the years."
02:11:17;02:11:19;"'Cause sometimes I just be like,"
02:11:19;02:11:20;"I could just split this up into two albums."
02:11:20;02:11:22;"Maybe add a couple songs,"
02:11:22;02:11:23;"but I just had this feeling like,"
02:11:23;02:11:27;"now after six years gone, it's like a bigger statement."
02:11:27;02:11:29;"And also now we have 18 songs to choose from."
02:11:29;02:11:31;"It just, it feels way better."
02:11:31;02:11:34;"I picture coming back with like a 10 song album."
02:11:34;02:11:36;"It just feels, it would have been impossible."
02:11:36;02:11:39;"I feel like definitely like this was the move."
02:11:39;02:11:43;"I couldn't have expressed the same idea in 10 songs."
02:11:43;02:11:45;"Maybe the next one will be short."
02:11:45;02:11:46;"- Tight."
02:11:46;02:11:48;"- A Pink Floyd style five song album."
02:11:48;02:11:50;"One of which is 25 minutes."
02:11:50;02:11:51;"- Would love that."
02:11:51;02:11:54;"Get that out in 2021."
02:11:54;02:11:57;"- 2021, fifth album drops."
02:11:57;02:11:58;"- That'll be fun."

02:11:58;02:11:59;"- That 20."
02:11:59;02:12:01;"- Long with a 25 minute jam."
02:12:01;02:12:04;"- Maybe we'll drop a January 1st, 2021."
02:12:04;02:12:08;"And the night before New Year's Eve, 2020."
02:12:08;02:12:09;"- Oh dude."
02:12:09;02:12:10;"Yeah."
02:12:10;02:12:12;"- Richard Pictures, Vampire Weekend."

02:12:13;02:12:15;"Hippos Reunion."
02:12:15;02:12:15;"- Yeah."
02:12:15;02:12:17;"- Very enthusiastic about that."
02:12:17;02:12:17;"- Haim."
02:12:18;02:12:22;"And we do the New Year's, 2020."
02:12:22;02:12:26;"That's when we drop the 20 minute, 21 second, 2021 version."
02:12:26;02:12:30;"Just jam and then just 10, nine, eight,"
02:12:30;02:12:33;"countdown, new year, 2021."
02:12:33;02:12:35;"- Play the new album in order."
02:12:35;02:12:36;"- Then we play the new album in order."
02:12:36;02:12:37;"- And."
02:12:37;02:12:39;"- We definitely got to do a New Year's show, 2020."
02:12:39;02:12:40;"Let's start planning it."
02:12:40;02:12:43;"- Definitely got to do a Days Between festival as well."
02:12:43;02:12:44;"- Oh, and Days Between."
02:12:44;02:12:45;"- That's a huge one."
02:12:45;02:12:47;"- Jerry Seinfeld, master of ceremonies"
02:12:47;02:12:49;"for the opening ceremony."
02:12:49;02:12:51;"Steve Lacey closes it out."
02:12:51;02:12:53;"- Screening of B movie in between."
02:12:53;02:12:54;"(laughing)"
02:12:54;02:12:55;"Play the whole film."
02:12:55;02:12:56;"- It's a two week festival."
02:12:56;02:12:58;"We got in the B movie tent."
02:12:58;02:12:59;"We're screening B movie."
02:12:59;02:13:00;"- 24/7."
02:13:00;02:13:03;"- 24/7 for two weeks."
02:13:03;02:13:06;"The lineup is a mixture of comedy and music."
02:13:06;02:13:07;"We got everything from Vampire Weekend,"
02:13:07;02:13:11;"Steve Lacey solo, the internet, Sid,"
02:13:11;02:13:13;"Jerry Seinfeld standup, Newman."
02:13:14;02:13:17;"Wait, Seinfeld, did you see that,"
02:13:17;02:13:18;"this is apropos of nothing,"
02:13:18;02:13:21;"did you see that thing I tagged you on on Instagram?"
02:13:21;02:13:25;"- Yeah, that sad shirt that was like, goodbye Jerry."
02:13:25;02:13:26;"- This was, I guess this was like,"
02:13:26;02:13:29;"I don't know if this is bootleg or official merch,"
02:13:29;02:13:31;"but it was like a final episode of Seinfeld,"
02:13:31;02:13:33;"maybe like a wrap party shirt,"
02:13:33;02:13:36;"or maybe NBC was selling it in their store or something,"
02:13:36;02:13:39;"and it literally just said like, whatever, May 1998,"
02:13:39;02:13:44;"and it said in like a serious font, goodbye Jerry."
02:13:44;02:13:45;"- Dot dot dot."
02:13:45;02:13:48;"- Dot dot dot, and then on the back, goodbye Newman."
02:13:48;02:13:54;"I was like, what a weirdly like sad and sentimental shirt"
02:13:54;02:13:55;"for a show like that."
02:13:55;02:13:57;"- And for that moment from that show."
02:13:57;02:13:59;"- If Seinfeld was a different type of show,"
02:13:59;02:14:02;"there actually would have been a weepy final episode"
02:14:02;02:14:03;"where Jerry's looking around his apartment,"
02:14:03;02:14:05;"it's like empty 'cause he's moving,"
02:14:05;02:14:07;"and Newman comes in and he's like,"
02:14:07;02:14:09;"I guess you must be pretty happy, Jerry."
02:14:09;02:14:12;"You won't have to live in a building with Newman anymore."
02:14:12;02:14:15;"Well, I bid you farewell, goodbye Jerry."
02:14:15;02:14:17;"And he walks away and Jerry's like,"
02:14:17;02:14:20;"Newman, come back here, and gives him a big hug."
02:14:20;02:14:21;"I love you, man."
02:14:21;02:14:24;"I love you, goodbye Newman."
02:14:24;02:14:25;"And that's like the--"
02:14:25;02:14:26;"- Fade to black."
02:14:26;02:14:27;"- Fade to black."
02:14:27;02:14:30;"- Do you remember how the Fresh Prince ended?"
02:14:30;02:14:31;"- Oh, that it does end with him"
02:14:31;02:14:32;"looking in the empty house, right?"
02:14:32;02:14:34;"- And flipping off the light switch."
02:14:34;02:14:36;"- Aw. - Silence."
02:14:36;02:14:37;"- I feel like Growing Pains also ended"
02:14:37;02:14:39;"with them moving out of the house."
02:14:39;02:14:41;"I guess that's a really easy way"
02:14:41;02:14:43;"to end with a situation comedy."
02:14:43;02:14:44;"- Sure."
02:14:44;02:14:45;"- It's just like moving time."
02:14:45;02:14:46;"- I would've been so sick of it"
02:14:46;02:14:48;"if the front said goodbye Jerry"
02:14:48;02:14:50;"and the back said, what a long strange trip it's been."
02:14:50;02:14:52;"(laughing)"
02:14:52;02:14:53;"And it'd be a weird Jerry Garcia,"
02:14:53;02:14:56;"Jerry Seinfeld crossover shirt."
02:14:56;02:14:58;"- Okay, Seinfeld, I think you gotta make us a few of those."
02:14:58;02:14:59;"- All right, I'm on it."
02:14:59;02:15:01;"- Oh yeah, dude, with the Seinfeld logo,"
02:15:01;02:15:03;"like somehow with that yellow oval,"
02:15:03;02:15:05;"and it says goodbye Jerry,"
02:15:05;02:15:07;"and then on the back, just classic,"
02:15:07;02:15:09;"wait, what a long strange trip it's been."
02:15:09;02:15:12;"- That's like an alternate Days Between is,"
02:15:12;02:15:16;"when Jerry died, August 8th or 9th, 1995?"
02:15:16;02:15:16;"- Yeah."
02:15:16;02:15:19;"- So between August '95 and May '98."
02:15:19;02:15:20;"- Days Between."
02:15:20;02:15:22;"- Those three years are the Days Between."
02:15:22;02:15:23;"(laughing)"
02:15:23;02:15:25;"- Do we have any idea if Jerry Garcia"
02:15:25;02:15:26;"ever watched Jerry Seinfeld?"
02:15:26;02:15:28;"- Oh man, that's such a good question."
02:15:28;02:15:30;"I'm like dying to know that."
02:15:30;02:15:32;"- I bet he did, like in a hotel room."
02:15:32;02:15:33;"- Maybe."
02:15:33;02:15:34;"- Although the thing is-- - This guy's got"
02:15:34;02:15:36;"a real high sensibility."
02:15:36;02:15:38;"- Seinfeld really,"
02:15:38;02:15:40;"Seinfeld really became like"
02:15:40;02:15:42;"this unstoppable cultural phenomenon,"
02:15:42;02:15:45;"I feel like '95 to '98."
02:15:45;02:15:46;"You know-- - Yeah."
02:15:46;02:15:47;"- Yeah, no, but totally--"
02:15:47;02:15:48;"- He might have been on the air"
02:15:48;02:15:49;"for five or six years. - No, you're right,"
02:15:49;02:15:51;"he's totally on the air, and he might have known him."
02:15:51;02:15:52;"He might have been like, ""Oh yeah,"
02:15:52;02:15:54;"""I saw that guy in Carson in the early '80s."""
02:15:54;02:15:55;"- You know, people might have been like,"
02:15:55;02:15:57;"""Do you like Seinfeld?"""
02:15:57;02:15:59;"You know, we talk about it all the time, right, shows?"
02:15:59;02:16:00;"- Mm-hmm."
02:16:00;02:16:01;"- You know, I don't have time for a sitcom, man."
02:16:01;02:16:03;"- You know, I wonder if he's on record,"
02:16:03;02:16:06;"we might have to like interview his daughter Trixie."
02:16:06;02:16:07;"- Let's get her on the horn."
02:16:07;02:16:09;"- How old is she, when was she born?"
02:16:09;02:16:12;"- Uh, she might have been born in like the '70s."
02:16:12;02:16:13;"- Yeah, I think she's in her 40s."
02:16:13;02:16:14;"- Oh, no way. - Yeah."
02:16:14;02:16:17;"- So she would have been like at home watching it with her dad."
02:16:17;02:16:18;"- Oh no, totally."
02:16:18;02:16:20;"I'm sure she probably gets asked"
02:16:20;02:16:22;"the most psycho questions from deadheads,"
02:16:22;02:16:23;"probably just being like,"
02:16:23;02:16:26;"""Do you understand that when you're a dad?"""
02:16:26;02:16:27;"Like just the weirdest hippie (beep)"
02:16:27;02:16:28;"so probably if somebody came up and was like,"
02:16:28;02:16:29;"""Hey, did your dad ever watch Seinfeld?"""
02:16:29;02:16:31;"Maybe she'd find that a refreshing question,"
02:16:31;02:16:32;"she'd be like, ""Oh yeah."""
02:16:32;02:16:35;"- She's just like, ""God, you guys always ask me this."""
02:16:35;02:16:36;"(laughing)"
02:16:36;02:16:37;"- The Seinfeld question again?"
02:16:37;02:16:42;"- ""I am sick and tired of you deadhead burnouts bothering me."
02:16:42;02:16:44;"""Your weird obsession with my dad"
02:16:44;02:16:46;"""and whether or not he watched Seinfeld."""
02:16:46;02:16:48;"- Yeah, they're both named Jerry, I get it."
02:16:48;02:16:49;"- Yeah, who cares?"
02:16:49;02:16:52;"- But Ezra, if a sitcom came out that was called Ezra,"
02:16:52;02:16:55;"you're gonna check it out, right?"
02:16:55;02:16:56;"- But it wasn't called-- - If it was called Ezra?"
02:16:56;02:16:57;"- It wasn't called Jerry."
02:16:57;02:16:59;"- No, this would be the equivalent of the--"
02:16:59;02:17:00;"This would be the equivalent--"
02:17:00;02:17:01;"- Okay, it was called K-Dig."
02:17:01;02:17:03;"- If there was some show about a character named like--"
02:17:03;02:17:04;"- No, no, no, it's not the equivalent."
02:17:04;02:17:08;"- Ezra Jones and the show was called Jones."
02:17:08;02:17:09;"- Right."
02:17:09;02:17:11;"- And you kept hearing about some character called--"
02:17:11;02:17:13;"- The equivalent would be that if one of these other Ezras"
02:17:13;02:17:17;"in the mix, like Ezra Miller, got a sitcom called Miller,"
02:17:17;02:17:19;"he'd be like, ""Are you interested in that new show Miller?"""
02:17:19;02:17:22;"And I'd be like, ""I don't know."""
02:17:22;02:17:26;"- But what if it was like the number one sitcom in the land?"
02:17:26;02:17:28;"You know, this parallel is kind of falling apart."
02:17:28;02:17:30;"- No, no, no, okay, no, that's a fair point."
02:17:30;02:17:32;"That's a fair point."
02:17:32;02:17:35;"Although, maybe the name Jerry is a little more common."
02:17:35;02:17:36;"Maybe in retrospect--"
02:17:36;02:17:37;"- I don't think it is."
02:17:37;02:17:39;"- Well, back then there was like Jerry Lewis."
02:17:39;02:17:41;"It's possible that for somebody Jerry Garcia's age,"
02:17:41;02:17:42;"you're like, ""Man, how crazy is it"
02:17:42;02:17:45;"""that there's this incredibly famous comedian"
02:17:45;02:17:46;"""with your name?"""
02:17:46;02:17:47;"He might have been like, ""Oh, Jerry Lewis?"
02:17:47;02:17:50;"""Man, yeah, those movies really, we used to take acid, man."
02:17:50;02:17:52;"""Me and Phil, we go down in the movies."
02:17:52;02:17:57;"""Man, we would be rolling in the aisles, man."
02:17:57;02:17:59;"""That Jerry Lewis, he was a cut-up, man."
02:17:59;02:18:01;"""He did some good work for the kids, man."""
02:18:01;02:18:03;"And he'd be like, ""No, Jerry Seinfeld."""
02:18:03;02:18:06;"And he's like, ""Oh, okay, okay, man."""
02:18:06;02:18:08;"I don't know, there are a lot of Jerries."
02:18:08;02:18:09;"- Jerry Brown."
02:18:09;02:18:13;"- What year was Jerry Lewis race car driver?"
02:18:13;02:18:15;"'93, I would say. - He might have heard that."
02:18:15;02:18:17;"He might have been aware of Promise."
02:18:17;02:18:18;"Man, well, now I feel like I really--"
02:18:18;02:18:19;"- We are going off the deep end here."
02:18:19;02:18:21;"- I feel like I really dropped the ball"
02:18:21;02:18:24;"in not asking Jerry Seinfeld the opposite question."
02:18:24;02:18:25;"- Oh, yeah."
02:18:25;02:18:27;"- Although, how would I have even phrased that?"
02:18:27;02:18:28;"Just like--"
02:18:28;02:18:29;"- Just random questions, Jerry."
02:18:29;02:18:30;"- Out of the blue."
02:18:30;02:18:32;"- Hey, man, thanks for being in the video."
02:18:32;02:18:34;"You like the Grateful Dead?"
02:18:34;02:18:37;"- You gotta use the song as like a linchpin."
02:18:37;02:18:39;"Some people are saying, ""You know what?"
02:18:39;02:18:42;"""That wouldn't work either."""
02:18:42;02:18:43;"I don't know."
02:18:43;02:18:45;"- I don't think Jerry Seinfeld likes the Dead."
02:18:45;02:18:48;"- Based on some of his famous personality traits,"
02:18:48;02:18:51;"being a neat freak, for instance,"
02:18:51;02:18:52;"doesn't sound like a guy who wants to hear"
02:18:52;02:18:54;"45-minute plan in the back."
02:18:54;02:18:55;"- Nope."
02:18:55;02:18:56;"Although, neither do I."
02:18:56;02:18:59;"(laughing)"
02:19:00;02:19:01;"- Oh, man."
02:19:01;02:19:02;"- Well, this was a pleasure."
02:19:02;02:19:04;"- Yeah, thanks for listening to the album."
02:19:04;02:19:05;"Thanks to all the TC heads."
02:19:05;02:19:08;"We do apologize for that subsection of TC heads"
02:19:08;02:19:10;"who are not into Vampire."
02:19:10;02:19:14;"Hopefully, there are a few interesting kernels"
02:19:14;02:19:16;"besides the music for you."
02:19:16;02:19:18;"We're having fun in New York right now."
02:19:18;02:19:19;"Webster Hall all-day show."
02:19:19;02:19:20;"- Oh, yeah."
02:19:20;02:19:23;"- 'Cause the idea was we were doing three sets,"
02:19:23;02:19:25;"and the middle set was playing the album front to back."
02:19:25;02:19:26;"So that's--"
02:19:26;02:19:28;"- Psyched I'm gonna be there."
02:19:28;02:19:29;"- That's gonna be a good vibe."
02:19:29;02:19:30;"- I think we're probably gonna play"
02:19:30;02:19:32;"like Jimmy Fallon this week."
02:19:32;02:19:33;"- Oh, very cool."
02:19:33;02:19:34;"- This coming week."
02:19:34;02:19:34;"- Get out of here."
02:19:34;02:19:35;"Harmony?"
02:19:35;02:19:38;"- I think this life at this point."
02:19:38;02:19:40;"- What about SNL?"
02:19:40;02:19:42;"- Maybe later."
02:19:42;02:19:43;"We'll see about that one."
02:19:43;02:19:44;"- Cool."
02:19:44;02:19:45;"- I don't know."
02:19:45;02:19:48;"The truth is I'm less interested in playing on TV than ever."
02:19:48;02:19:51;"And trust me, I've had good experiences at all these places."
02:19:51;02:19:52;"But there's also a part of me that's just like,"
02:19:52;02:19:54;"you know what, who cares?"
02:19:54;02:19:56;"Yeah, it's, I don't know."
02:19:56;02:19:58;"It's just so hard to make it sound good."
02:19:58;02:19:59;"It just always stresses me out."
02:19:59;02:20:03;"Whereas like, I like when you play live,"
02:20:03;02:20:05;"there is a vibe in the room."
02:20:05;02:20:07;"And even if like somebody makes a recording"
02:20:07;02:20:08;"and it doesn't sound the same,"
02:20:08;02:20:10;"I don't know, it's just a different."
02:20:10;02:20:14;"I think my, as my enthusiasm has risen for touring,"
02:20:14;02:20:17;"my enthusiasm for other kind of like promotional things"
02:20:17;02:20:20;"has decreased, but I think we'll find a good vibe"
02:20:20;02:20:21;"on Jimmy, we'll make sure it's fun."
02:20:21;02:20:22;"Maybe we just, it's like with touring."
02:20:22;02:20:24;"It's like now we mix up the set list,"
02:20:24;02:20:26;"do this and that to make it more fun."
02:20:26;02:20:28;"Maybe I got to just have that approach with everything."
02:20:28;02:20:32;"Anyway, ""Father of the Bride"", new album, check it out."
02:20:32;02:20:33;"A lot more TC coming."
02:20:33;02:20:35;"We've been banking the EPs."
02:20:35;02:20:37;"We've been down in the EP mines."
02:20:37;02:20:38;"So I hope you enjoy them."
02:20:38;02:20:40;"Maybe we'll see some of you on tour."
02:20:40;02:20:41;"Peace."
