00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. Boy do we have some news to catch up on. We gotta talk about"
00:08;00:15;"Duncan, Duncan Donuts. We gotta talk about Stake 'Em's and their social media presence."
00:15;00:21;"We gotta talk about Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper and their new film A Star is Born."
00:21;00:27;"All this, plus much more Jim Morrison, on this week's Time Crisis."
00:27;00:33;"Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:45;01:09;"To the floor, One of us had to go, Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:19;"One of us is crying, One of us is lying, Leave it on me babe."
01:19;01:22;"Time Crisis back again, we're gonna get right into it today."
01:22;01:24;"We got a lot to get through."
01:24;01:25;"TC78."
01:25;01:29;"This is a major time crisis, just a lot of time crisis-y stuff has been happening in"
01:29;01:30;"the world."
01:30;01:34;"But Jake, you were just saying something interesting before the show started."
01:34;01:39;"That even though it might be played out, you still love the film The Big Lebowski with"
01:39;01:40;"all of your soul."
01:40;01:47;"Yeah, I mean I was saying it's played out to like do long extended quotes from the film"
01:47;01:53;"because I feel like everyone in my life, including my parents, have that film memorized."
01:53;01:59;"And so like we just got a new rug in our little TV room."
01:59;02:05;"And I was like, Hannah, I'm saying this completely sincerely, it's also sort of a reference,"
02:05;02:07;"but honestly the rug ties the room together."
02:07;02:08;"It really does."
02:08;02:10;"And just like an eye roll."
02:10;02:12;"I mean, because I'm doing Lebowski quotes daily."
02:12;02:15;"It is my favorite film."
02:15;02:20;"And most of my friends are on that wavelength of like having it memorized."
02:20;02:22;"So I'll make the most subtle reference."
02:22;02:26;"And that's how we got into this before the show started."
02:26;02:27;"Just making a subtle Lebowski reference."
02:27;02:30;"See, a friend of ours, car was broken into."
02:30;02:31;"Right."
02:31;02:32;"I mean, that's one of the..."
02:32;02:33;"And I was like, wouldn't hold that much hope for that tape deck."
02:33;02:39;"I think over the past few years, even like the concept of quoting movies is played out."
02:39;02:40;"Yeah."
02:40;02:45;"Like even just quoting movies is like reminiscent of another era."
02:45;02:46;"Why is that, you think?"
02:46;02:52;"I think there's been an association with like nonstop movie quoting as being like a fratty"
02:52;02:53;"thing to do."
02:53;02:54;"Oh, interesting."
02:54;02:55;"Fratty?"
02:55;02:56;"Yeah."
02:56;02:59;"So you might think that everybody more or less likes movies."
02:59;03:01;"They might have wildly different tastes."
03:01;03:02;"Sure."
03:02;03:06;"So you would think that whoever likes movies would quote the movies that they like."
03:06;03:08;"Maybe for you it's Big Lebowski."
03:08;03:11;"Maybe for somebody else it's Avengers Infinity War."
03:11;03:12;"51st Date."
03:12;03:14;"Which is a deeply unquotable film."
03:14;03:16;"Well, I guess there's one quote that people always say."
03:16;03:17;"What is it?"
03:17;03:19;"Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good."
03:19;03:20;"Whack quote."
03:20;03:21;"Come on."
03:21;03:26;"I think there's almost like a stereotype of like a frat guy who just all he can do is"
03:26;03:27;"quote movies."
03:27;03:30;"I just think it's like more like dorks, which I guess frat guys are dorks."
03:30;03:31;"Frat guys are the nerdy dorks."
03:31;03:33;"They're just a different version of dorks."
03:33;03:40;"Because like I was a dork in high school and we quoted like Ghostbusters and Back to the"
03:40;03:42;"Future nonstop."
03:42;03:49;"And as discussed on TC episode 72, my high school yearbook quote was from Ghostbusters,"
03:49;03:51;"Slow Down Cheater Food."
03:51;03:52;"Deep cut."
03:52;03:53;"A deep cut quote."
03:53;03:54;"Deep cut."
03:54;03:55;"But here's the thing."
03:55;03:59;"I love that you still ride for the Big Lebowski because I think something happens when something"
03:59;04:01;"becomes like a really like iconic cult."
04:01;04:06;"It's like happening with Rick and Morty now where people like are really into it and ride"
04:06;04:07;"for it."
04:07;04:11;"And then it becomes a stereotype of the type of person who's obsessed with that is so annoying."
04:11;04:15;"And then suddenly it casts this weird shadow on the thing itself."
04:15;04:16;"Which it shouldn't."
04:17;04:20;"I've watched some Rick and Morty and I enjoyed it."
04:20;04:25;"But based on what I've taken in from the internet in the past year, a lot of the people that"
04:25;04:31;"I think are cool make a lot of snide remarks about these straw men who are so into Rick"
04:31;04:32;"and Morty."
04:32;04:33;"I don't get it."
04:33;04:34;"And are so annoying."
04:34;04:35;"I love that show."
04:35;04:40;"I see people referring to that."
04:40;04:41;"Pickle Rick."
04:41;04:43;"Yeah, people like make fun of Rick and Morty fans."
04:43;04:44;"I'm like, it's a good show."
04:44;04:45;"What's your problem?"
04:45;04:46;"Well, that's Jake."
04:46;04:47;"You guys are overthinking it."
04:47;04:48;"Cause you're actually cool."
04:48;04:49;"Am I?"
04:49;04:52;"You're not fashionable, but you're cool."
04:52;04:55;"You don't follow the trends of the day."
04:55;05:02;"I'm free to do what I want."
05:02;05:07;"Any old time."
05:07;05:14;"I'm free to do what I want."
05:14;05:17;"Any old time."
05:17;05:20;"So love me."
05:20;05:23;"Hold me."
05:23;05:26;"Love me."
05:26;05:29;"Hold me."
05:29;05:36;"I'm free to do what I want."
05:36;05:41;"I'm free to sing my song."
05:41;05:45;"So it gets out of town."
05:45;05:49;"I'm free to sing my song."
05:49;05:54;"I'm free to sing my song."
05:54;05:57;"I'm free to sing my song."
06:00;06:05;"But anyway, it's unfashionable to be a hardcore Lebowski head and to quote it."
06:05;06:07;"This might be not that related."
06:07;06:09;"Let me see if I can tie it together."
06:09;06:13;"I've noticed a kind of a, and Seinfeld, you can back me up because it's kind of a meme thing."
06:13;06:14;"Sure."
06:14;06:17;"It's meme talk with Seinfeld 2000."
06:17;06:27;"I've noticed this, like, I don't know if you'd call this a meme, but a recurring motif in memes, which is kind of, well, I guess it's a verbal construction meme."
06:27;06:33;"That's kind of like doing this or being into X is not a replacement for having a personality."
06:33;06:35;"We see that pop up in memes and jokes."
06:35;06:36;"Yeah."
06:36;06:42;"And the one I see often, you know, when I'm just perusing Instagram, it's often about smoking weed."
06:42;06:47;"It's kind of like a snide urbane person who kind of knows what's up."
06:47;06:50;"And they might say something like being into weed is not a personality."
06:50;06:53;"And at first I was kind of like, yeah, they're right."
06:53;06:54;"It's not a personality."
06:54;07:01;"But then I thought about it more and I was like, yeah, then Jim Morrison style took a deep breath."
07:01;07:02;"So, you know what?"
07:02;07:03;"This really bothers me."
07:03;07:07;"And I just thought about this because I feel like I've known all these different types of people in my life."
07:07;07:09;"And I've probably been all these people in my life."
07:09;07:11;"You know, we all go through changes."
07:11;07:15;"And I was like the person who's so into smoking weed and talks about it all the time."
07:15;07:18;"Yes, there's something a bit sad and silly about them."
07:18;07:24;"But then this other character, the person who's always talking about how these other people don't have real personalities."
07:24;07:26;"I know that person too."
07:26;07:30;"The person who goes around saying that the guy who's so into smoking weed doesn't have a real personality."
07:30;07:31;"I know that guy too."
07:31;07:33;"At times in my life I could relate to that guy."
07:33;07:36;"That's kind of the snide dorky hater."
07:36;07:37;"That's the critic."
07:38;07:46;"And then I thought about it and I was like, given the chance to spend an afternoon with the guy who thinks smoking weed is a personality."
07:46;07:53;"And the guy who thinks that he should constantly say that the guy who thinks smoking weed is a personality is wrong."
07:53;07:59;"I think I might rather care to pass that afternoon with the guy who thinks smoking weed is a personality."
07:59;08:00;"You know what I'm saying?"
08:00;08:02;"That guy just sounds kind of chill."
08:02;08:03;"Maybe a little stupid."
08:03;08:05;"Yeah, it could go either way."
08:05;08:06;"I'm just saying it's a toss up."
08:06;08:07;"You're really rolling the dice."
08:07;08:08;"I'm just saying it's a toss up."
08:08;08:09;"Total toss up."
08:09;08:19;"So I guess in a way it's kind of like the guy who just loves a movie and quotes it from time to time versus the guy who's obsessed with how lame it is to quote movies."
08:19;08:21;"I think I'll go with the guy who just quotes that movie that he likes."
08:21;08:23;"This is sort of a tangent."
08:23;08:24;"Yeah."
08:24;08:25;"It's semi-related."
08:25;08:27;"Maybe we're skating on thin ice here."
08:27;08:28;"Uh oh."
08:28;08:31;"Why do people hate Elon Musk all of a sudden?"
08:31;08:32;"Oh God."
08:32;08:34;"The guy makes the best cars."
08:34;08:39;"I mean I don't own a Tesla, but those cars rule and there's zero emissions."
08:39;08:44;"And then I saw something online today where Kanye was at some like art school or something and he was like."
08:44;08:45;"Leave Elon Musk."
08:45;08:46;"I saw that."
08:46;08:47;"He's standing on some labels."
08:47;08:50;"People were clowning on him for smoking weed on Rogan."
08:50;08:52;"I'm like this is tight."
08:52;08:53;"What's the problem?"
08:53;08:56;"Okay, well I guess there's a lot to unpack there."
08:56;08:57;"I don't have the full context."
08:57;08:59;"You know why people are souring on Kanye now."
08:59;09:00;"Obviously."
09:00;09:01;"Of course."
09:01;09:05;"I mean with Elon Musk, here's a few sentiments that I've seen."
09:05;09:07;"Yeah, hating on Elon Musk for smoking weed is whack."
09:07;09:13;"Well, I thought of it because of Lebowski too because it's like he was so cool for a while and then all of a sudden it was just like it became played out."
09:13;09:15;"Like he just flipped."
09:15;09:20;"I think he has his fanboys, but you know what?"
09:20;09:23;"Maybe it's because he was seen as like the cool CEO for a second."
09:23;09:24;"Yeah."
09:24;09:29;"That more people started to wake up and started to be like no CEOs are cool."
09:29;09:32;"Look, I'm not going to go to like I don't know the facts."
09:32;09:43;"I just like have a very cursory knowledge of him and I just was like I remember just tracking that on the internet that all of a sudden the winds shifted with Elon."
09:43;09:49;"If it's because he smoked weed, I think that's lame because you know who doesn't smoke any weed or drink any alcohol?"
09:49;09:51;"President of the United States, Donald J. Trump."
09:51;09:53;"Didn't we get an email or something?"
09:53;09:56;"Again, there's been so much time crisis-y stuff in the news."
09:56;10:01;"Didn't Donald Trump like cheers with a Diet Coke at the UN?"
10:01;10:03;"Does that sound familiar?"
10:03;10:06;"I don't think that's an email we got."
10:06;10:10;"I mean that sounds like something that happened, but I don't remember it."
10:10;10:13;"Man, we have so many time crisis like go-to topics."
10:13;10:19;"Remember when this show started out, very quickly it became that we talk about kind of music and corporate food history."
10:19;10:28;"But as we dive deeper into each of those subcategories, it's really like we could do a weekly what's going on with Diet Coke if we wanted to."
10:28;10:33;"We could do a weekly what's going on with Frito-Lay Corp."
10:33;10:35;"We've talked about Dunkin' Donuts before."
10:35;10:36;"Yes, we have."
10:36;10:38;"Jake, did you hear the big news about Dunkin' Donuts?"
10:38;10:39;"I did."
10:39;10:41;"I am very tapped in."
10:41;10:48;"Actually, the week before this announcement, I was in a car with some friends and for some reason, I think it was early morning."
10:48;10:52;"We were going down to Disneyland actually, which is a whole separate story."
10:52;11:01;"But we came up with a new slogan for Dunkin' Donuts, which was ""I'm down for Dunkin'"" or just ""down."""
11:01;11:06;"Like as the campaign evolves over the years?"
11:06;11:07;"It just becomes ""down."""
11:07;11:12;"When a corporation can own one word like that, that's masterful."
11:12;11:13;"Down for Dunkin'."
11:13;11:16;"And then they changed their name to Dunkin' a week later."
11:16;11:19;"So I was like, ""That's great. Down for Dunkin'."""
11:19;11:21;"I think it's a great phrase."
11:21;11:25;"Especially if you make a fun commercial."
11:25;11:26;"""Are you down for Dunkin'?"""
11:26;11:29;"Yeah, and then that becomes a thing. You text everybody, ""Who's down for Dunkin'?"""
11:29;11:35;"Because Dunkin' Donuts, as I've said on this show, is one of the chains I've always had a soft spot for."
11:35;11:37;"Sure. East Coast."
11:37;11:42;"Yeah, I almost considered it a heritage brand of the tri-state area."
11:42;11:47;"I didn't realize that it's really a--more than anything, it's a Massachusetts thing."
11:47;11:48;"Really?"
11:48;11:49;"It's a Boston thing."
11:49;11:50;"Okay."
11:50;11:52;"I think it comes from Massachusetts."
11:52;11:54;"I think I want to say Quincy, Mass."
11:54;11:55;"Quincy, Mass."
11:55;11:56;"I could be wrong on that."
11:56;12:00;"Every 30 episodes on TC, we've got to do a deep dive on Dunkin'."
12:00;12:01;"Who's down for--"
12:01;12:02;"Quincy, Mass."
12:02;12:03;"Nailed that."
12:03;12:04;"Really?"
12:04;12:05;"Hold on, hold on, hold on."
12:05;12:06;"Oh, year?"
12:06;12:07;"I want to do the founding year."
12:07;12:08;"What year do you think?"
12:08;12:09;"Oh, man."
12:09;12:11;"I don't have a sense of it. I can't remember."
12:11;12:15;"I'm just going to guess wildly and say '72."
12:15;12:16;"'55."
12:16;12:17;"Oh, you're closer."
12:17;12:18;"Okay."
12:18;12:19;"'50."
12:19;12:20;"Wow, early."
12:20;12:21;"Oh, early."
12:21;12:22;"Okay, that rings a bell now."
12:22;12:23;"Wow."
12:23;12:27;"The first Dunkin' Donut, and it was spelled the same way, right there on Southern Artery"
12:27;12:28;"in Quincy."
12:28;12:34;"I think the Down for Dunkin' campaign could be like, the running gag is that a bunch of"
12:34;12:39;"people are in all these various situations, but they're always down for Dunkin'."
12:39;12:40;"Right."
12:40;12:41;"They're at a wedding, they're at a funeral."
12:41;12:42;"Hey, you down for Dunkin'?"
12:42;12:43;"Dunkin' traffic."
12:43;12:44;"Right, yeah."
12:44;12:51;"I think it's really important for a brand that serves something that's bad for you to"
12:51;12:54;"become that kind of hall pass brand."
12:54;12:56;"You know what I'm saying?"
12:56;13:02;"I think Down for Dunkin' could help make people understand that when you're near a Dunkin',"
13:02;13:07;"when you're at an event that has Dunkin', when you are so blessed that a friend is making"
13:07;13:12;"a Dunkin' run, your diet goes out the window, your eating habits go out the window."
13:12;13:13;"This is a special."
13:13;13:17;"It's like, I kind of- I know you're no carb, no gluten, it's out"
13:17;13:18;"the window."
13:18;13:19;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin'."
13:19;13:21;"You're down for Dunkin'."
13:21;13:23;"Yesterday was my cheat day."
13:23;13:24;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin'."
13:24;13:25;"That's the next one."
13:25;13:27;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin'."
13:27;13:29;"That's the idiocracy version."
13:29;13:30;"Yeah."
13:30;13:33;"Welcome to Costco, I love you."
13:33;13:34;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin'."
13:34;13:36;"It's just a- It's kind of bad."
13:36;13:38;"It's kind of Because I Can vibes."
13:38;13:39;"Oh yeah, exactly."
13:39;13:41;"It's Because I Can."
13:41;13:46;"I was born in a free country, the United States of America."
13:46;13:49;"My forefathers died so I could drink this Diet Coke."
13:49;13:54;"But yeah, with Dunkin', just, ""Hey man, didn't your doctor say you shouldn't have any sugar?"""
13:54;13:56;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin'."
13:56;13:59;"Weren't you in a coma for four months?"
13:59;14:00;"Yeah."
14:00;14:01;"It's f*ckin' Dunkin', dude."
14:01;14:04;"It's 4 AM, I got the heart and breath for ale."
14:04;14:07;"I got a lot of booze, it's over with, this is not the third rail."
14:07;14:10;"Friday night and Friday, I'm headed for the station."
14:10;14:12;"It's a two-way ride to Tokyo, but it's too soon."
14:12;14:15;"Dedicated to the boomers in the back of the one train."
14:15;14:18;"Baby, kickin' out with those high, I'm cocaine."
14:18;14:21;"And then, just to turn style, I woke up last again."
14:21;14:24;"Right between the cars, busy smokin'."
14:24;14:27;"Head for the left, hook off the rest and light blackout."
14:27;14:29;"Don't expect to hold the point, put that crack out."
14:29;14:32;"You know you're light up when the lights go down."
14:32;14:34;"You think you're breathing, New York Post won't speak."
14:34;14:35;"Downtown."
14:35;14:38;"Same faces every day, but you don't know their name."
14:38;14:41;"Bloody people throwing places on a D train."
14:41;14:45;"Stop that train, I wanna get on."
14:45;14:54;"Checkin' trench coat, waiting, going to work."
14:54;14:57;"And you can feel in a dream like a Captain Kirk."
14:57;15:00;"Big pocket gangsters paying the debts."
15:00;15:03;"I caught a bullet in the lung from burning gas."
15:03;15:06;"Also working under pay, the baronet, the fool."
15:06;15:08;"Prostitutes and dex, caught in the sliding door."
15:08;15:10;"Now you're stuck between the stations."
15:10;15:11;"And it seems like an eternity."
15:11;15:14;"Sweating like soft dreams in a flop house fraternity."
15:14;15:17;"A $50 fine for disturbing the peace."
15:17;15:20;"The neck, tortoise, your leaves, I'll crease."
15:20;15:23;"Hot cup of coffee and the donuts at Tokyo."
15:23;15:25;"Friday night and Jamaican Queens for you."
15:25;15:28;"Elevated, I'm never gonna fall."
15:28;15:31;"Riding over the counter where I always get my cash from."
15:31;15:34;"Prostitutes, we thought this move was straight out of Rome."
15:34;15:37;"Over the last week, we're about to all time."
15:37;15:39;"Sad crush from my man, I'm reading El Diario."
15:39;15:42;"Riding the train down from the El Barrio."
15:42;15:45;"From the station to Arnjulius."
15:45;15:48;"I brought a hot dog from, ooh, Georgia, cool, yeah."
15:48;15:50;"Okay, but this is funny. I'm looking at the tweet right now."
15:50;15:51;"Yeah."
15:51;15:54;"It's official. We're going by Duncan now."
15:54;15:57;"That little like smiley emoji with the hands going hee hee."
15:57;16:00;"After 68 years of America running on Duncan,"
16:00;16:02;"we're moving to a first name basis."
16:02;16:05;"Yellow heart, okay."
16:05;16:08;"Excited to be #BFFStatus with you all."
16:08;16:11;"Some more emoji."
16:11;16:14;"#FirstNameBasis, #Besties."
16:14;16:15;"I hate hashtags."
16:15;16:16;"Pushing it there."
16:16;16:19;"Who's clicking on the first name basis hashtag"
16:19;16:23;"to find other tweets that say first name basis?"
16:23;16:24;"I got to collect those."
16:24;16:26;"Wait, how many retweets do you think this has?"
16:26;16:29;"Oh, 22,000."
16:29;16:32;"Good guess, no, but 4,800."
16:32;16:33;"I don't know if that means it didn't kill it."
16:33;16:35;"It's got almost 15,000 likes, though."
16:35;16:38;"You know what the first thing that popped into my head was"
16:38;16:39;"when I heard about this?"
16:39;16:40;"What's that?"
16:40;16:42;"This is fake bravery."
16:42;16:43;"This is stolen valor."
16:43;16:45;"This is like IHOP, dude."
16:45;16:48;"Basically, what I was thinking is, you know what?"
16:48;16:50;"Swinging big and changing your name is a big deal."
16:50;16:53;"Dropping the donuts, everybody knows you for your donuts."
16:53;16:57;"I guess you want to not be fully associated with donuts."
16:57;16:59;"Maybe they think the next generation will be more likely"
16:59;17:01;"to go get a coffee or a sandwich there"
17:01;17:03;"if they aren't thinking about the donuts."
17:03;17:04;"Breakfast sandwich."
17:05;17:07;"But then the first thing I thought was, okay,"
17:07;17:09;"if you really got some [bleep]"
17:09;17:11;"then you should let somebody else call their [bleep]"
17:11;17:12;"Dunkin' Donuts."
17:12;17:14;"Let me open a Dunkin' Donuts."
17:14;17:16;"Okay, you want to be Dunkin', I get it."
17:16;17:18;"You're throwing your whole heritage away."
17:18;17:21;"But why can't we still have Dunkin' Donuts?"
17:21;17:22;"You know what I mean?"
17:22;17:23;"Wow."
17:23;17:24;"That's heavy, dude."
17:24;17:26;"I was just like, this is fake bravery."
17:26;17:28;"Fake stolen valor."
17:28;17:30;"This is stolen valor."
17:30;17:31;"You know what I mean?"
17:31;17:32;"Put your money where your mouth is."
17:32;17:34;"Okay, you're done with Dunkin' Donuts?"
17:34;17:35;"Okay."
17:35;17:37;"But they're saying they're on a first-name basis."
17:37;17:39;"They're not saying they're done."
17:39;17:43;"I mean, it'd be like if you changed your name to Vampire,"
17:43;17:45;"which is how I refer to your band."
17:45;17:48;"And then somebody else just took over with Vampire Weekend."
17:48;17:49;"I don't know."
17:49;17:52;"I think people should loosen up about copyright, you know?"
17:52;17:54;"I feel you on that."
17:54;17:55;"What is this DNKN?"
17:55;17:56;"They've also truncated--"
17:56;17:57;"Yeah, that's like a mess."
17:57;17:59;"Yeah, I think we--"
17:59;18:01;"It feels like that's the next logical jump."
18:01;18:03;"It seems like they did two, two and one."
18:03;18:07;"Somebody asked them, ""So your logo will just be 1D?"""
18:07;18:10;"They wrote back, ""Nope, the DD is still alive."""
18:10;18:15;"I guess at least IHOP was kind of an epic troll."
18:15;18:16;"This is just weird."
18:16;18:18;"I don't know how I feel about this."
18:18;18:19;"Not going to age well."
18:19;18:20;"Dunkin'."
18:20;18:22;"People are already calling them Dunkin' too, right?"
18:22;18:24;"This isn't a radical change."
18:24;18:26;"It's like if Burger King became BK,"
18:26;18:28;"McDonald's became Mickey D's."
18:28;18:29;"You know what this is?"
18:29;18:32;"This is similar to that thing I was saying about the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
18:32;18:34;"This is fan service."
18:34;18:36;"They're just sucking up to the fans."
18:36;18:39;"""Hey, guys, we know you mostly call it Dunkin'."
18:39;18:40;"Now we call it Dunkin' too."
18:40;18:41;"We're just like you, man."""
18:41;18:43;"The fans are like, ""Uh-huh."""
18:43;18:44;"Yeah."
18:44;18:45;"Cool."
18:45;18:47;"It's that same thing of just like,"
18:47;18:51;"""Hey, guys, I know you always wanted to see Iron Man and Spider-Man have a joke together."
18:51;18:52;"Here you go."""
18:52;18:54;"Do you think employees answered the phone,"
18:54;18:56;"""Thank you for calling Dunkin'""?"
18:56;18:57;"Now they probably do."
18:57;18:59;"""Thank you for calling Dunkin' on Pal Avenue."""
18:59;19:04;"I should point out that one of the first replies to Dunkin' Donuts was from DiGiorno"
19:04;19:05;"where they just waved at them,"
19:05;19:07;"and then Dunkin' wrote back, ""Hiya,"""
19:07;19:09;"and then DiGiorno said, ""You can call us DiGiorne."""
19:09;19:12;"And then Dunkin' wrote, ""Then call us Dunkin' now."""
19:12;19:14;"And then DiGiorno wrote, ""Deal, heart."""
19:14;19:16;"This is disgusting."
19:16;19:18;"Can I ask you, what do you dislike more,"
19:18;19:21;"when there's animosity between the two brands"
19:21;19:24;"or when they kind of are getting along and promoting each other?"
19:24;19:25;"That's a great question."
19:25;19:28;"I like more when there's animosity between the brands"
19:28;19:30;"because let's keep it real here."
19:30;19:31;"Dog eat dog."
19:31;19:33;"This is a dog eat dog world,"
19:33;19:36;"and just don't lie to us."
19:36;19:40;"I'm far more wicked when a brand pretends to be a chill person."
19:40;19:42;"So Dunkin' and DiGiorno--"
19:42;19:46;"Not competitors per se."
19:46;19:48;"You know, it would be fun to kind of get in there"
19:48;19:50;"and just be like--treat both of them."
19:50;19:52;"Love you, DiGiorno."
19:52;19:56;"I would far rather stay at home and make one of your pizzas"
19:56;19:58;"than ever eat any of the bullsh*t they serve at Dunkin' Donuts."
19:58;20:00;"Signed, Frank Castle."
20:00;20:01;"Yeah."
20:01;20:02;"Anyway."
20:02;20:04;"This is some post IHOP."
20:04;20:08;"I know, I just thought that Dunkin' Donuts was cooler."
20:08;20:09;"Oh, man."
20:09;20:12;"Then they got this whole weird promotion with Oreo and--"
20:12;20:15;"Go to hell."
20:15;20:17;"Go to hell."
20:17;20:18;"Man."
20:18;20:20;"Last episode I told Steve Miller to go to hell."
20:20;20:21;"Yeah."
20:21;20:23;"This episode, Dunkin' Donuts."
20:43;20:45;"Time Crisis."
20:45;20:48;"This all leads us to probably the most time crisis-y thing"
20:48;20:50;"that has happened recently."
20:50;20:53;"We were getting all sorts of tweets about this, e-mails,"
20:53;20:54;"things of that nature."
20:54;20:57;"I think it was in the episode that we created the concept"
20:57;20:59;"of Frank Castle and Punisher Burgers."
20:59;21:03;"Before that, we kind of made a prediction, as I recall,"
21:03;21:05;"and we were just talking about how all these brands"
21:05;21:08;"were kind of like one-upping each other with their social media presences"
21:08;21:12;"to say, like, who's funnier or who has more savage clapbacks or something."
21:12;21:16;"And I believe we more or less said there will come a day"
21:16;21:20;"where a brand straight-facedly tries to tell other people,"
21:20;21:22;"you know what, guys?"
21:22;21:24;"All these other brands are full of [bleep] but I'm a straight shooter."
21:24;21:27;"That's kind of how we started the Punisher Burgers thing."
21:27;21:29;"Although we took it to its logical extreme,"
21:29;21:32;"which would be an actual person asserting their personhood."
21:32;21:34;"That's why Punisher Burgers always had Frank Castle."
21:34;21:36;"I'm just one man."
21:36;21:39;"So finally a brand actually decided--"
21:39;21:40;"Stepped up."
21:40;21:42;"--to step up and say, you know what?"
21:42;21:43;"Let's cut the crap."
21:43;21:45;"And that brand was Steakums."
21:45;21:48;"Steakums is just like a kind of nasty, really cheap steak."
21:48;21:50;"Is it on a sandwich or--"
21:50;21:54;"It's frozen steak that you buy in the frozen food aisle."
21:54;21:55;"--thinly sliced."
21:55;21:58;"That you, like, microwave or, like, heat up in a pan."
21:58;22:00;"I remember eating it. It's rough stuff."
22:00;22:01;"It was invented in--"
22:01;22:03;"It's frozen meat."
22:03;22:05;"It was--yo, this is sick."
22:05;22:08;"Steakums was invented in 1968 by food technologist--"
22:08;22:10;"Oh, dude, '68."
22:10;22:11;"--Eugene Gagliardi--"
22:11;22:12;"Oh."
22:12;22:14;"--who is also credited with inventing popcorn chicken."
22:14;22:15;"That's sick."
22:15;22:17;"Okay, he's kind of a hero."
22:17;22:19;"I like popcorn chicken."
22:19;22:23;"It really officially started in 1975 out of Westchester, PA,"
22:23;22:26;"and then went to--Hines brand bought it, and then--"
22:26;22:28;"Marketed under its Ore-Ida frozen foods brand."
22:28;22:29;"I like that."
22:29;22:31;"Oh, yeah, Ore-Ida. They make some good [bleep]"
22:31;22:36;"Long story short, it ended up with Quaker-made meats in 2006."
22:36;22:37;"I love corporate histories."
22:37;22:41;"'94 was acquired by Tri Foods International."
22:41;22:44;"And then Gagliardi sued Tri Foods in 1996 after he was fired"
22:44;22:46;"and removed as chairman of the board."
22:46;22:48;"Can you imagine the heat on that?"
22:48;22:51;"The inventor of Steakums pleading with the board,"
22:51;22:54;"""You can't do this to me. I invented Steakums."""
22:54;22:55;"Like--"
22:55;22:56;"""We don't need you anymore, Gagliardi."""
22:56;22:59;"It's just like Elon Musk trying to get him to leave Tesla."
22:59;23:04;"Mid-'90s Steakum just--scene was hot."
23:04;23:06;"That's amazing."
23:06;23:08;"Just at home talking to his family."
23:08;23:10;"They're trying to push me out."
23:10;23:12;"I [bleep] invented Steakums."
23:12;23:16;"Isn't it just, like, frozen sliced beef?"
23:16;23:18;"What did you invent exactly?"
23:18;23:20;"Dad, I mean, I'll give you props for popcorn chicken,"
23:20;23:24;"but Steakums just seems like a real step down."
23:24;23:28;"It's just thinly sliced roast beef."
23:28;23:30;"There was a lawsuit in 2012,"
23:30;23:34;"and the judge describes the product as, quote,"
23:34;23:37;"""Chopped and formed emulsified meat product"
23:37;23:40;"comprised of beef trimmings left over"
23:40;23:41;"after an animal is slaughtered"
23:41;23:43;"and all the primary cuts such as tenderloin,"
23:43;23:45;"fillet, and rib eye are removed."
23:45;23:48;"The emulsified meat is then pressed into a loaf"
23:48;23:51;"and sliced, frozen, and packaged."""
23:51;23:53;"And then actually I went down the rabbit hole"
23:53;23:55;"a little bit on Quaker-made meats."
23:55;23:56;"It's like a hot dog, essentially."
23:56;23:58;"Yeah, it's kind of like a meatloaf hot dog."
23:58;23:59;"The leftovers."
23:59;24:00;"Yeah."
24:00;24:02;"So I don't know--do you know Glassdoor?"
24:02;24:04;"It's sort of the company review site."
24:04;24:05;"No."
24:06;24:09;"So employees of any company can go on Glassdoor.com"
24:09;24:12;"and review where they work or have recently worked."
24:12;24:16;"So the Glassdoor review for Quaker-made meats"
24:16;24:17;"has only one entry,"
24:17;24:20;"and part of the entry, it's the lowest possible review,"
24:20;24:23;"and the person says, ""The product is disgusting."
24:23;24:26;"Talk about the lowest quality, quote, unquote, meat"
24:26;24:27;"you can imagine."
24:27;24:28;"Roadkill is better."
24:28;24:32;"All the meat comes from overseas and comes in moldy"
24:32;24:34;"and almost 75% fat."""
24:34;24:36;"Ooh."
24:36;24:37;"Rough stuff, folks."
24:38;24:40;"That's gnarly."
24:40;24:42;"Yeah, it really seems nasty."
24:42;24:44;"So I guess Steakums--"
24:44;24:46;"so that's the current owner, Quaker-made meats."
24:46;24:48;"So just so everybody knows the backstory."
24:48;24:50;"That's the product we're dealing with."
24:50;24:53;"Steakums is an orphan brand violently ripped"
24:53;24:54;"from its creator."
24:54;24:56;"Steakums is like a Frankenstein"
24:56;24:58;"ripped away from its noble creator,"
24:58;25:01;"and now this Frankenstein is taken to the streets,"
25:01;25:04;"is coming after the villagers with their pitchforks."
25:04;25:08;"# Messenger of fear and sight"
25:08;25:12;"# Dark deception kills the light"
25:12;25:25;"# Hybrid children watch the sea"

25:57;26:01;"# Immortal"
26:01;26:10;"# In madness you dwell"
26:10;26:12;"In 2017, Steakums started a campaign"
26:12;26:14;"to have their Twitter account verified"
26:14;26:16;"with the hashtag #VerifiedSteakum,"
26:16;26:18;"and they were verified on January 15, 2008."
26:18;26:20;"They've been known for trolling other brands,"
26:20;26:22;"including Denny's, Wendy's, and Moon Pie."
26:22;26:24;"Oh, so they've been at this for a while."
26:24;26:26;"They are the original Punisher burgers."
26:26;26:28;"Philadelphia agency Alibac Communications"
26:28;26:30;"is behind the Steakums Twitter account."
26:30;26:32;"Alibac account director Jesse Bender"
26:32;26:34;"told Adweek that the agency was given the green light"
26:34;26:36;"in August 2017 to start managing"
26:36;26:37;"the Steakums Twitter account."
26:37;26:39;"The goal was to begin a dialogue with consumers"
26:39;26:40;"and create a community."
26:40;26:42;"So this is all the backstory on Steakums."
26:42;26:44;"And then Steakums went a little viral."
26:44;26:47;"They wrote a tweet thread that started with this."
26:47;26:50;"It was on the Steakums verified Twitter account."

27:35;27:37;"Now they're being resold their childhoods"
27:37;27:40;"by remake/sequel spin-offs and other cheap nostalgia,"
27:40;27:43;"making them more cynical to growth or authenticity."
27:43;27:45;"They often don't have parents to talk to"

28:20;28:22;"End rant."
28:22;28:23;"Steak 'em, bless."
28:23;28:27;"Are they going to frozen meat companies on Twitter?"

28:41;28:43;"Shout out to whatever/whoever."
28:43;28:45;"You know, there's somebody having some fun."
28:45;28:47;"I mean, this is probably the type of [bleep] that I would write"
28:47;28:48;"if I was just some--"
28:48;28:51;"got a job at a Philadelphia-based advertising agency,"
28:51;28:53;"and they're just like, ""Steak 'Em's doesn't give a [bleep]"

28:56;28:57;"Think outside the box here."
28:57;28:59;"We're selling the bottom of the barrel here,"
28:59;29:03;"like the dregs in the frozen food aisle."
29:03;29:06;"We could just say, like, anything."
29:06;29:08;"There's something Trump-ian about this."
29:08;29:09;"Oh, for sure."
29:09;29:11;"And I know that probably--"
29:11;29:14;"I bet whoever wrote this is not pro-Trump,"
29:14;29:17;"working at a Philadelphia-based advertising agency, I'm guessing."
29:17;29:20;"But there is also something about, like, just the task"
29:20;29:24;"of trying to turn Steak 'Em's into something noble."
29:24;29:26;"There's something very Republican about it, actually,"
29:26;29:28;"'cause it's that vibe of just, like, kind of, like,"
29:28;29:32;"actively participating in really [bleep] up systems"
29:32;29:34;"and then trying to, like, talk about, like,"
29:34;29:36;"the nobility of the suffering that you cause."
29:36;29:38;"There's a lot of fundamental premises"
29:38;29:40;"that I'm not buying with Steak 'Em's."
29:40;29:42;"Yeah, and number one, I think you pointed that out, Jake."
29:42;29:43;"This whole rant starts out,"
29:43;29:45;"""Why are so many young people flocking to brands"
29:45;29:47;"on social media for love, guidance, and attention?"""
29:47;29:48;"They're not."
29:48;29:49;"Are they?"
29:49;29:50;"Are they."
29:50;29:51;"The correct way to phrase it would be, like,"
29:51;29:56;"why are young people amused when brands target them"
29:56;30:00;"in the space where they spend most of their time?"
30:00;30:02;"Young people are not flocking to brands."

30:03;30:05;"a specific generational thing,"
30:05;30:07;"that's, like, similar to being, like,"
30:07;30:10;"""Why do frat boys in the '90s flock to Budweiser commercials?"
30:10;30:12;"It's because they're lonely, isolated."

30:17;30:18;"Yeah."

30:25;30:29;"Brands are doing attention-getting stunts."
30:29;30:31;"Anyway, I guess in 2014,"

30:41;30:42;"Oh, okay."
30:42;30:44;"I mean, on the face of it,"
30:44;30:46;"I mean, I guess that applies to some creative people."
30:46;30:48;"Kind of ahead of the game, to be honest."
30:48;30:49;"Right, but--"
30:49;30:50;"It's, like, 2014?"
30:50;30:51;"Ayn Rand is beloved by--"

31:44;31:45;"What's a palate cleanser?"
31:45;31:46;"Twiddle."
31:46;31:48;"We could go down that route."
31:48;31:49;"Let's throw on some Twiddle."
31:49;31:51;"Twiddle, this song is called ""Jam Flow Man."""

31:55;31:57;"Have you heard of the Jam Flow Man?"

32:05;32:07;"playing shows across the lane."
32:07;32:09;"Rocking out with his band,"
32:09;32:11;"playing a fat old reggae jam."
32:11;32:14;"No, the Jam Flow Man, won't you make that sound?"
32:14;32:16;"Make my body move all around."
32:16;32:18;"Twist it up and blaze it down,"

32:29;32:31;"Jam Flow Man, he started young,"

32:33;32:35;"First the blues, then with jazz,"
32:35;32:37;"the Jam Flow Man blew up real fat."
32:37;32:39;"Now the Jam Flow Man at the age of ten"

32:41;32:43;"He was real good now and he was real good then,"

32:55;32:56;"Today's still not the day."
32:56;32:57;"We just gave you a little taste."
32:57;32:58;"Yep."
32:58;32:59;"""Jam Flow Man"" by Twiddle."
32:59;33:01;"Eventually we will talk about it,"
33:01;33:02;"but in the meantime, all TC heads"
33:02;33:05;"should go check out this song, ""Jam Flow Man"" by Twiddle,"
33:05;33:07;"which is a very controversial song"
33:07;33:09;"within the jam band community."
33:09;33:10;"Correct?"
33:10;33:11;"Fair to say."
33:11;33:15;"Eventually we will do an entire episode on ""Jam Flow Man."""
33:15;33:17;"Anyway, you know, on the last episode,"
33:17;33:18;"we didn't really get anywhere with it,"
33:18;33:21;"but we found out some pretty disturbing news"
33:21;33:22;"about Steve Miller,"
33:22;33:26;"which is that he toured with the Grateful Dead"
33:26;33:27;"in the early '90s,"
33:27;33:29;"even performed with them."
33:29;33:31;"Not just opened for them, performed with them."
33:31;33:32;"Was it a full tour?"
33:32;33:33;"I think it was a whole summer tour,"
33:33;33:35;"because I saw on Instagram"
33:35;33:37;"somebody was selling a T-shirt from that run."
33:37;33:39;"Somebody tagged us in it,"
33:39;33:40;"and there was a T-shirt from that run"
33:40;33:43;"that was like, you know, ""Summer Tour '92"" or whatever."
33:43;33:44;"'92, yeah."
33:44;33:47;"And then we found out that after Jerry passed,"
33:47;33:48;"Steve Miller did multiple interviews"
33:48;33:50;"where he talked about how much he disliked the Grateful Dead."
33:50;33:52;"Just threw him under the bus."
33:52;33:53;"Threw him under the bus."
33:53;33:56;"He waited until Jerry died to talk that [bleep]"
33:56;33:57;"said they were boring, whatever."
33:57;33:59;"Class act, Steve."
33:59;34:00;"[laughs]"
34:00;34:04;"And Jake was so fired up, he said, ""Go to hell."""
34:04;34:05;"Yeah."
34:05;34:07;"We gotten anywhere with getting in touch with Steve Miller"
34:07;34:08;"to tell his side of the story?"
34:08;34:11;"I reached out to the band on Twitter, nothing,"
34:11;34:15;"and I did also reach out to the band's publicist"
34:15;34:18;"and followed up, wrote a very nice email,"
34:18;34:20;"very cordial, and nothing."
34:20;34:22;"Radio silence from the Miller camp."
34:22;34:23;"There's two sides to every story."
34:23;34:25;"Maybe Steve will come back and say,"
34:25;34:26;"""I did open for the Grateful Dead."
34:26;34:29;"I did perform with them, and I wanted to like them."""
34:29;34:32;"But honestly, behind the scenes, Jerry was a [bleep] to me."
34:32;34:34;"Phil was very difficult."
34:34;34:35;"Phil was very rude to me."
34:35;34:38;"I heard him laughing about my song ""The Joker,"""
34:38;34:39;"which I think is a great song,"
34:39;34:43;"and Phil was just laughing as if my songs had no depth."
34:43;34:44;"And yeah, did I harbor a grudge?"
34:44;34:45;"You're goddamn right I did."
34:45;34:49;"And after Jerry died, did I feel free to finally speak my mind"
34:49;34:50;"and get a few licks in?"
34:50;34:51;"Yeah, I did."
34:51;34:52;"Okay, I would understand that."
34:52;34:57;"I lit up from Reno, I was trailed by 20 hounds"
34:57;35:01;"Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around"
35:01;35:04;"Set out to run, but I take my time"
35:04;35:06;"A friend of the devil is a friend of mine"
35:06;35:13;"I get home before daylight, just might get some sleep tonight"
35:13;35:20;"Ran into the devil, baby, loaned me 20 mil"
35:20;35:25;"Spent the night in Utah, in a cave up in the hills"
35:25;35:27;"Set out to run, but I take my time"
35:27;35:30;"A friend of the devil is a friend of mine"
35:30;35:36;"I get home before daylight, just might get some sleep tonight"
35:36;35:41;"Anyway, but speaking of people who wait until somebody dies to talk their [bleep]"
35:41;35:44;"I was very disappointed to hear about this."
35:44;35:47;"As you know, on the last episode,"
35:47;35:49;"I talked about this Jim Morrison interview that I love"
35:49;35:52;"where he responds to an interviewer fat-shaming him."
35:52;35:54;"He's way ahead of his time."
35:54;35:56;"People didn't even use the word fat-shaming back then."
35:56;36:01;"And Jim Morrison pauses, and he makes a case for why it's fine to be fat."
36:01;36:03;"And then we start talking about it."
36:03;36:04;"You know what, Jim Morrison?"
36:04;36:07;"He's kind of out of fashion these days, but he's pretty cool, actually."
36:07;36:08;"You know what? I [bleep] with the Doors."
36:08;36:09;"The Doors are cool."
36:09;36:11;"'Cause I've been saying for years that the Doors are not cool."
36:11;36:15;"But now I'm shifting gears, and I'm saying the Doors are cool, man."
36:15;36:18;"They haven't been cool for about 15, 20 years."
36:18;36:22;"It's dope that you're so flexible to change your opinions."
36:22;36:26;"People age. They get solidified, calcified in their views."
36:26;36:27;"That's right."
36:27;36:28;"Look at you."
36:28;36:29;"No, the Doors are cool."
36:29;36:30;"And then you know what?"
36:30;36:31;"I'm back in with the Doors."
36:31;36:33;"Almost right after we talked about that,"
36:33;36:37;"I wanted to go see Jay-Z and Beyoncé at the Rose Bowl."
36:37;36:38;"Oh, yeah."
36:38;36:39;"You sent me some image."
36:39;36:41;"I sent you an image because, you know,"
36:41;36:43;"Jay-Z and Beyoncé, it doesn't get more cutting edge than that."
36:43;36:44;"True that."
36:44;36:46;"[laughs]"
36:46;36:48;"Every time I've seen either one of them live,"
36:48;36:51;"I've always been kind of awestruck by the show."
36:51;36:52;"And I'm not somebody who gets--"
36:52;36:54;"I don't get that excited about going to concerts."
36:54;36:57;"Even this concert, I'll be honest, I was kind of like--"
36:57;36:59;"I feel like I saw Beyoncé at Coachella yesterday."
36:59;37:00;"Uh-huh."
37:00;37:02;"And then I get there, within five minutes,"
37:02;37:04;"I'm like, ""I'm so glad I'm here."""
37:04;37:05;"They always do something a little different."
37:05;37:07;"They have so many incredible visuals."
37:07;37:09;"You're in the Rose Bowl, but it felt almost intimate"
37:09;37:12;"because they have this giant, giant screen,"
37:12;37:15;"one of the biggest screens that I've ever seen."
37:15;37:18;"And a lot of really interesting imagery,"
37:18;37:19;"a lot of it pre-shot."
37:19;37:22;"So anyway, there's some song that they're performing,"
37:22;37:27;"and the kind of motif for the visuals was famous mug shots."
37:27;37:28;"Mm-hmm."
37:28;37:31;"And who's one of the first ones that they put on this screen?"
37:31;37:34;"Probably 100 feet tall for all the Rose Bowl to see."
37:34;37:35;"Jim Morrison."
37:36;37:39;"And then I'm like, ""Holy sh*t, Jay-Z and Beyoncé"
37:39;37:40;"are basically telling to the world,"
37:40;37:43;"'We know the Doors have not been particularly cool"
37:43;37:46;"in the classic rock community for the past 15, 20 years."
37:46;37:48;"We know that right now Grateful Dead are very hot,"
37:48;37:51;"and nobody's really talking about the Doors anymore."
37:51;37:54;"But here Jay-Z and f*cking Beyoncé are saying"
37:54;37:56;"Jim Morrison is relevant again.'"""
37:56;37:59;"And I was like, ""Okay, Jim Morrison got a shout-out"
37:59;38:01;"on Time Crisis. That's one."
38:01;38:05;"Now his mug shot is plastered 100 feet high"
38:05;38:08;"at the Rose Bowl with Jay-Z and Beyoncé."
38:08;38:10;"That's two. When am I going to see three?"""
38:10;38:12;"Well, guess what? I didn't have to wait very long."
38:12;38:15;"The last time I saw Jay-Z and Beyoncé perform together,"
38:15;38:17;"this is On the Run 2 tour."
38:17;38:19;"I saw On the Run 1 tour."
38:19;38:23;"And in that concert, they both have so many great hits,"
38:23;38:25;"but that was this moment where kind of"
38:25;38:28;"Beyoncé was ascending at light speed,"
38:28;38:30;"and Jay-Z was kind of settling into his, like,"
38:30;38:31;"elder statesman status."
38:31;38:34;"So I remember a lot of people saying about that show,"
38:34;38:36;"""I mean, it was all about Beyoncé."""
38:36;38:37;"And, you know, I'm a big Jay-Z fan,"
38:37;38:38;"so I was kind of like, ""Come on, you know,"
38:38;38:39;"it's about both of them."""
38:39;38:40;"But people were like, ""I don't know, just Beyoncé."""
38:40;38:42;"It was so exciting seeing Beyoncé then."
38:42;38:45;"Whereas at this show, I really felt like it was 50/50."
38:45;38:46;"You know, Beyoncé did her thing,"
38:46;38:48;"but hearing Jay-Z dip back into the hits,"
38:48;38:50;"that was pretty cool, man."
38:50;38:52;"And so anyway, here I am thinking,"
38:52;38:54;"deep in my thoughts about,"
38:54;38:57;"""Am I going to see a third Jim Morrison reference"
38:57;38:59;"to really let me know that the doors are back?"""
38:59;39:02;"And then Jay-Z busts into this song,"
39:02;39:04;"which I hadn't heard or thought about in a long time."

45:47;45:49;"- Looking up to one of his elders."
45:49;45:51;"Just two classic rock front men."
45:51;45:53;"- Yeah, Radiohead came out of the gate"
45:53;45:55;"as a very straightforward rock band."
45:55;45:56;"- They really did."
45:56;45:57;"- Yeah."

46:05;46:08;"during a performance of the song at MTV's Beach House,"
46:08;46:10;"he changed it up a little bit."
46:10;46:12;"And as we all know, in a live show--"
46:12;46:14;"Drake did this to Kanye recently--"
46:14;46:17;"the live show's a great time to subtly change up some lyrics"
46:17;46:19;"to throw shade."

46:20;46:22;"- This time, Tom York's saying,"
46:22;46:26;"""Maybe if I grow my hair, I can become Jim Morrison."
46:26;46:28;"Fat, ugly, dead."""
46:28;46:29;"Damn."
46:29;46:30;"- Lighten up, Tom."
46:30;46:31;"- Yeah, Jesus."
46:31;46:34;"So first of all, I gotta say--"
46:34;46:36;"and you know, look, this is a long time ago."
46:36;46:38;"I'm sure Tom has changed a lot."
46:38;46:39;"- I'm sure he's mellowed out."
46:40;46:42;"But I also just wanna point out,"
46:42;46:44;"'cause I was saying on the last show"
46:44;46:46;"that I was very impressed that in 1969,"
46:46;46:49;"Jim Morrison was already taking a stand against fat shaming"
46:49;46:51;"in a way that would not have been very popular."
46:51;46:52;"- Jim was chill."
46:52;46:55;"- He was chill, and he was loving about it."
46:55;46:57;"You know, as you recall, he said to the interviewer,"
46:57;46:59;"""I have a real problem with this."""
46:59;47:03;"That was in 1969, and 24 years later, 1993,"
47:03;47:06;"a young rock front man could still be screaming"
47:06;47:10;"about how Jim Morrison, who had died 20-something years earlier,"
47:10;47:12;"was fat and ugly and dead."
47:12;47:14;"And you know, Tom York, he's one of those lucky guys."
47:14;47:16;"I don't think he has a problem keeping the pounds off."
47:16;47:18;"- Hell of a metabolism."
47:18;47:20;"- Everybody knows that Tom York is a skinny guy."
47:20;47:21;"- Well, he's vegan."
47:21;47:22;"That'll keep the pounds off,"
47:22;47:24;"unless you're just eating french fries, steak--"
47:24;47:27;"- But vegans don't get a pass to fat shame, do they?"
47:27;47:28;"- No, bro."
47:28;47:29;"- Wait, Seinfeld, on the Internet,"
47:29;47:31;"do vegans get a pass to fat shame?"
47:31;47:32;"Do you get a number crunch on that?"
47:32;47:34;"- Oh, no, they don't."
47:34;47:35;"- Oh, you didn't even crush the numbers, okay."
47:35;47:38;"- I bet Tom York was not vegan in '93."
47:38;47:40;"- I bet he was crushing burgers."
47:40;47:41;"- Okay, well, hold on."
47:41;47:42;"Let's get a little more context,"
47:42;47:45;"'cause maybe Tom was doing some performance art."
47:45;47:48;"1993 interview with Melody Maker, he said of the track,"
47:48;47:50;"""It's really just a series of thoughts"
47:50;47:51;"about getting up on stage,"
47:51;47:53;"making a brat of yourself, and making a career out of it."
47:53;47:55;"I'm sure it was great to be Jim Morrison in 1968,"
47:55;47:58;"but a lot of people can't relinquish these obsessions."""
47:58;48:00;"Okay, that's not so bad. - Yeah."
48:00;48:01;"- At least in that interview,"
48:01;48:03;"he's kind of just, like, poking holes"
48:03;48:07;"at the idea of Jim Morrison as, like, an idol."
48:07;48:09;"I could understand that he's a young rock singer"
48:09;48:10;"coming out and being like,"
48:10;48:12;"""You know, you gotta kill your idols a little bit."""
48:12;48:14;"Maybe he's saying Jim Morrison has been elevated"
48:14;48:16;"to a godlike status, whatever."
48:16;48:18;"I don't know, that seems fair."
48:18;48:19;"But hold on."
48:19;48:22;"A year before, he did another interview"
48:22;48:23;"where he was talking about it,"
48:23;48:25;"and this is what he said."
48:25;48:26;"- '92 is early."
48:26;48:30;"- ""Jim Morrison's a fat, talentless bastard,"
48:30;48:34;"and he's dead, and none of that means anything."""
48:34;48:37;"What's the obsession with Jim Morrison being fat?"
48:37;48:39;"I gotta say, there's something weird."
48:39;48:40;"This is a true time crisis."
48:40;48:44;"We're dipping in 1969, 1992, 2018."
48:44;48:47;"There is something really sad to me to think about,"
48:47;48:49;"and I understand Jim Morrison."
48:49;48:50;"I had an impression of him, too,"
48:50;48:55;"that he was kind of, like, pretentious, full of himself."
48:55;48:57;"And I gotta say, when we heard that interview,"
48:57;48:58;"that really changed things for me."
48:58;49:00;"So it's really sad to think that in 1969,"
49:00;49:02;"Jim Morrison was being this thoughtful guy."
49:02;49:03;"- Yeah."
49:03;49:04;"- And then 23 years later,"
49:04;49:06;"Tom York had to come out of the gate with Radiohead"
49:06;49:08;"saying that he's a fat, talentless bastard,"
49:08;49:09;"and he's dead."
49:09;49:10;"So anyway, here's the whole quote."
49:10;49:11;"- Yeah, yeah."
49:11;49:13;"- ""Jim Morrison's a fat, talentless bastard,"
49:13;49:15;"and he's dead, and none of that means anything."
49:15;49:17;"It's more important just to have your own voice"
49:17;49:18;"within the business than to live up to this thing"
49:18;49:19;"that you're supposed to live up to."
49:19;49:21;"I'm reading this book by Lester Bangs at the moment,"
49:21;49:23;"and there's this brilliant thing about how,"
49:23;49:25;"on the one hand, rock 'n' roll should be taken"
49:25;49:26;"very seriously, while on the other hand,"
49:26;49:29;"it should be completely taking the piss out of itself."
49:29;49:30;"Like the Stooges, on the one hand,"
49:30;49:31;"they're a real f*cked up band,"
49:31;49:33;"but on the other hand, they just take the piss."
49:33;49:35;"Iggy Pop is totally taking the piss so badly."""
49:35;49:36;"That's one of those things,"
49:36;49:39;"I feel like we talk about this on Time Crisis a lot,"
49:39;49:41;"there's always the little biases,"
49:41;49:43;"and the narcissism, small difference"
49:43;49:44;"at any kind of cultural moment."
49:44;49:47;"I was kind of raised in not a totally dissimilar time"
49:47;49:50;"from early '90s where I was reading rock magazines"
49:50;49:53;"and stuff, and of course, that probably made me"
49:53;49:55;"cool on Jim Morrison a little bit,"
49:55;49:58;"because I understood that from the rock critic point of view,"
49:58;50:01;"Iggy Pop, who I also like and admire,"
50:01;50:03;"and I like the Stooges and I like his solo stuff,"
50:03;50:09;"Iggy Pop is punk rock, funnier, more zany,"
50:09;50:12;"seemingly more self-aware, whereas Jim Morrison"
50:12;50:13;"would be whatever."
50:13;50:15;"And I also gotta say, at some point,"
50:15;50:17;"when you're just kind of repeating the received wisdom"
50:17;50:20;"of the critics, you gotta at least take a step back"
50:20;50:22;"and say, ""I don't have an original thought."""
50:22;50:23;"You know what I mean?"
50:23;50:27;"I would say, yeah, as a rebuttal to Tom here back in '92,"
50:27;50:29;"we can't go too hard on Tom here,"
50:29;50:32;"'cause this was probably when he was like 20 or whatever,"
50:32;50:35;"but-- - How old was Tom York in '92?"
50:35;50:37;"- The Doors have more memorable songs"
50:37;50:39;"than the Stooges or Iggy Pop."
50:39;50:41;"I'm just gonna throw that out there,"
50:41;50:43;"I'm gonna say this, the Doors were a much more"
50:43;50:46;"original band than the Stooges and Iggy Pop."
50:46;50:49;"- Wow. - In '92, Tom was 24."
50:49;50:53;"- Also, you know Iggy loved Jim Morrison,"
50:53;50:54;"at least in the early days."
50:54;50:56;"They're both out there shirtless wearing leather pants,"
50:56;50:58;"get out of here. - I'm sure, yeah."
50:58;51:02;"- They're both these like, heroin chic front men,"
51:02;51:04;"get out of here. - They got something in common."
51:04;51:06;"And also I gotta say, I like the Stooges,"
51:06;51:08;"but if you had no context for it,"
51:08;51:11;"and you were like, there was a band from the '60s,"
51:11;51:14;"they had this kind of like hardness and this minimalism"
51:14;51:19;"that almost prefigured punk rock or New Wave or something,"
51:19;51:21;"there's like something really cool about them,"
51:21;51:22;"and you played the Stooges,"
51:22;51:24;"you'd be like, all right, I can see that."
51:24;51:26;"But also if you played them this,"
51:26;51:31;"you'd be kind of like, oh yeah."
51:31;51:35;"There's a reason Jay-Z didn't sample any Stooges songs,"
51:35;51:37;"it's 'cause this one just goes off."
51:37;51:38;"- It sounds like Yeezus, man."
51:38;51:40;"- Yeah, this does sound like Yeezus."
51:40;51:43;"And I get it, like Jim Morrison."
51:43;51:46;"- Kanye kinda sometimes will do that sort of weird Morrison,"
51:46;51:51;"like, ugh. - Ugh, Kanye's our Jim Morrison."
51:51;51:53;"- He kind of is, dude."
51:53;51:56;"Nobody likes to talk about Jim Morrison anymore."
51:56;51:58;"- You know who produced that Jay-Z song?"
51:58;52:00;"- Was it Kanye? - It was Kanye."
52:00;52:01;"- Oh!"
52:01;52:02;"- Also, fun fact about that song."
52:02;52:04;"- Dude, that's amazing. - Do you remember that--"
52:04;52:05;"- Full circle, man."
52:05;52:06;"- Do you remember that song Nickelback did"
52:06;52:09;"on a Spider-Man soundtrack, and it was like Chad Kroger--"
52:09;52:10;"- Oh, with Josie from Saliva."
52:10;52:13;"I knew that, that that's him-- - I do not know that song."
52:13;52:16;"- So, remember there was a band called Saliva?"
52:16;52:17;"- No."
52:17;52:20;"- ♪ I think that a hero could save me ♪"
52:20;52:22;"- There was a band called Saliva?"
52:22;52:25;"- Yeah, and the singer was a guy named Josie."
52:25;52:26;"- I've never heard of that band."
52:26;52:29;"- They were kind of part of that, like, post-rap rock wave."
52:29;52:31;"Anyway, they-- - Saliva?"
52:31;52:34;"- They didn't want to actually sample the doors,"
52:34;52:35;"so they recreated the sample."
52:35;52:38;"So it's not on the Jay-Z song, it's not Jim Morrison,"
52:38;52:42;"it's the guy from Saliva going, ""Yeah, oh, yeah, come on!"""
52:42;52:43;"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
52:43;52:44;"- You're getting a pretty good Morrison impression."
52:44;52:45;"- No, he killed it."
52:45;52:47;"I always felt like people were hard on that band Saliva,"
52:47;52:50;"and I was like, ""I'll f--- with this dude, Josie from Saliva."""
52:50;52:52;"Definitely way more than Nickelback."
52:52;52:54;"Although, maybe Nickelback's okay, too."
52:54;52:57;"Anyway, I think what we're learning here"
52:57;53:00;"is that biases against certain styles of music"
53:00;53:03;"and musicians come in and out of fashion, man,"
53:03;53:04;"and it's all just posturing."

54:06;54:08;"- But anyway, I gotta say, and I like both of them,"
54:08;54:11;"but the idea that Iggy Pop was so much more, you know,"
54:11;54:13;"ahead of the curve and smart and savvy,"
54:13;54:16;"and then you hear that Jim Morrison interview, 1969,"
54:16;54:17;"speaking up against fat shaming."
54:17;54:20;"I would say if you compare Jim Morrison, Iggy Pop,"
54:20;54:22;"and Tom York, out of all three of them,"
54:22;54:25;"Jim Morrison is the one who's the most ahead of his time, man."
54:25;54:26;"- I love it."
54:26;54:30;"- Also, if there's any rock critics listening,"
54:30;54:32;"like, I like Tom York, I like Radiohead too."
54:32;54:36;"I just wonder if today somebody is like,"
54:36;54:39;"""Hey, man, you know, Jim Morrison struggled"
54:39;54:41;"with fat shaming for his whole life."""
54:41;54:42;"I don't know if you ever heard this interview,"
54:42;54:44;"from 1969, where he kind of like had to put"
54:44;54:46;"an interviewer in his place, and he was kind of"
54:46;54:47;"speaking out against fat shaming,"
54:47;54:49;"like, way before it was fashionable."
54:49;54:51;"Like, do you ever think about the,"
54:51;54:53;"how multiple times in the early days,"
54:53;54:55;"you were (beep) all over Jim Morrison,"
54:55;54:59;"and you specifically mocked a dead man for his weight?"
54:59;55:00;"I wonder if Tom York would be like,"
55:00;55:03;"""I was really insecure, man, in the early days of Radiohead."
55:03;55:04;"I honestly thought I was too skinny,"
55:04;55:06;"and it made me feel better about myself"
55:06;55:09;"to make fun of Jim Morrison for being fat,"
55:09;55:11;"and yeah, it was easy, 'cause he was dead."""
55:11;55:12;"And, uh--"
55:12;55:15;"- And I knew our first album was just really generic alt-rock."
55:15;55:17;"- And realistically-- - And I was really insecure,"
55:17;55:19;"and I hadn't found my voice yet artistically."
55:19;55:22;"- It wasn't until ""OK Computer"" that I could admit"
55:22;55:25;"that I was OK too, and I didn't need to punch down."
55:25;55:27;"And obviously, the Doors' first album"
55:27;55:28;"is better than our first album."
55:28;55:30;"- Did a little number crunching, and--"
55:30;55:31;"(laughter)"
55:31;55:35;"I found this 1993 profile of Radiohead"
55:35;55:36;"from Details magazine."
55:36;55:38;"I don't know if you remember Details."
55:38;55:39;"- Oh, yeah. - Sure."
55:39;55:40;"- Top Men's magazine from back in the day."
55:40;55:44;"And at one point, the interviewer compares Radiohead"
55:44;55:47;"to Nirvana, and Tom York is quoted saying"
55:47;55:51;"that he looks ""incredibly like Kurt Cobain,"""
55:51;55:55;"but didn't have a ""fat, ugly wife."""
55:55;55:56;"- Ooh!"
55:56;55:57;"- And then-- - Damn!"
55:57;55:58;"- And then the next line is,"
55:58;56:01;"""Kurt Cobain was pretty sore about that."""
56:01;56:02;"- Yo."
56:02;56:04;"- Looks like a little bit of a frat boy."
56:04;56:08;"- That's one year later, after the Morrison thing."
56:08;56:10;"- Jesus! - It looks like he tries"
56:10;56:13;"to walk back the comment as a joke,"
56:13;56:16;"but by that point, the cat was already out of the bag."
56:16;56:17;"- Wait, in the same interview?"
56:17;56:19;"- Yeah, it goes, ""Oops, that was a joke."
56:19;56:21;"""I didn't expect Kurt to read it."""
56:21;56:23;"- Wait, wait, also-- - That just seems like"
56:23;56:25;"in a subsequent interview, he must have said that."
56:25;56:26;"- You know what, maybe this interview"
56:26;56:29;"is quoting a previous interview with Tom."
56:29;56:31;"- Of course Kurt read it."
56:31;56:33;"- The bottom line is, Tom York"
56:33;56:35;"fat-shamed Courtney Love."
56:35;56:36;"- Ooh!"
56:36;56:37;"- Around the same time."
56:37;56:40;"- What the hell?"
56:40;56:43;"- This is so funny. - Oh my God."
56:43;56:44;"I guess that also just goes to show--"
56:44;56:47;"- Early radio ads, rough stuff, folks."
56:47;56:49;"- Damn."
56:49;56:50;"Let's try to take a step back"
56:50;56:51;"and not make it about Tom York,"
56:51;56:54;"'cause again, people change."
56:54;56:56;"Who knows what was going on with him back then?"
56:56;56:58;"I guess it also goes to show, though,"
56:58;57:00;"just how much, like, the standards"
57:00;57:01;"of what's fashionable on one hand"
57:01;57:04;"and what's okay to say changes so much."
57:04;57:06;"- Oh, yeah. - 'Cause just picture, like,"
57:06;57:07;"Tom York's always been kind of, like,"
57:07;57:09;"a lefty, buck-against-the-system dude."
57:09;57:12;"I bet he always cared about what are his passions,"
57:12;57:13;"the environment, things like that."
57:13;57:15;"I bet that hasn't changed."
57:15;57:17;"It's just that back then-- - Oh, yeah."
57:17;57:18;"- You could just say, like--"
57:18;57:19;"just imagine, like, a young rock band"
57:19;57:22;"coming out today and one of the first interviews"
57:22;57:25;"somebody did was about another prominent person's wife"
57:25;57:27;"and they called them fat."
57:27;57:28;"I think it might be a rap."
57:28;57:29;"- People will lose their mind."
57:29;57:32;"- So I assume that Tom York doesn't speak that way anymore,"
57:32;57:34;"but you know what, I'm gonna try to take"
57:34;57:36;"a positive spin on all this, 'cause I do think"
57:36;57:38;"Tom York's made a lot of beautiful music for the world"
57:38;57:40;"and probably has done a lot of good for the world."
57:40;57:44;"I think it just goes to show that people who are thrust--"
57:44;57:47;"and I think it's probably even worse now that, like--"
57:47;57:48;"- Yeah, young people are just--"
57:48;57:51;"- People are thrust into the spectacle of music"
57:51;57:53;"and it's so inherently competitive."
57:53;57:56;"People are just so desperate to just talk [bleep]"
57:56;57:58;"about each other or to prove why I'm better"
57:58;57:59;"than that person or something."
57:59;58:01;"I feel like--wait, was this, like,"
58:01;58:02;"Brandon Wardell or somebody?"
58:02;58:04;"There's some kind of funny tweet or something"
58:04;58:06;"that was basically saying how, like,"
58:06;58:09;"art or music or whatever is basically just, like,"
58:09;58:11;"sports for nerds or something."
58:11;58:13;"- Is this competitive?"
58:13;58:17;"- Yeah, that it's funny because sports, at least,"
58:17;58:22;"doesn't make a claim to be getting at the inner truths"
58:22;58:24;"of what it means to be a good person."
58:24;58:26;"- The essence of humanity."
58:26;58:28;"- Yeah, whereas--I mean, some people probably say"
58:28;58:30;"that about sports, but music does,"
58:30;58:32;"and there is something kind of refreshing"
58:32;58:34;"about just being like, ""Let's keep it real."""
58:34;58:38;"Like, some of the same impulses that are pushing the,"
58:38;58:40;"you know, linebacker on the football field"
58:40;58:42;"to just crush the other dude"
58:42;58:45;"because they want the sweet taste of success,"
58:45;58:47;"they want to win so badly, they want to prove"
58:47;58:49;"that they're better than their competitors,"
58:49;58:51;"to pretend that that is something that only exists"
58:51;58:54;"in sports or jocks or something, like, ""Give me a break."""
58:54;58:57;"Even Tom York, everything about him should scream ""sensitive."""
58:57;58:59;"His lyrics are sensitive and stuff,"
58:59;59:02;"and even him, at one point in his life,"
59:02;59:05;"wanted to lash out against Curt and Courtney's feelings"
59:05;59:07;"or hurt Jim Morrison's feelings."
59:07;59:09;"So rather than look at that as, like,"
59:09;59:11;"a failure of Tom York's in particular,"
59:11;59:13;"'cause I don't think that's fair, I would say, you know,"
59:13;59:16;"that's just what this crazy world does to people."
59:16;59:19;"Good, sensitive people can be really mean"
59:19;59:21;"when they think that their whole life depends on it,"
59:21;59:23;"and a lot of people, when they're out there"
59:23;59:25;"doing their interviews or tweeting or whatever,"
59:25;59:28;"sometimes they can feel like their whole life depends"
59:28;59:31;"on building a brand that's edgy"
59:31;59:34;"and puts down the right people."
59:34;59:37;"Back in the early '90s, you could do that by calling people fat."
59:37;59:39;"Today, you're not allowed to do it by calling people fat."
59:39;59:42;"People have woken up to just how horribly cruel that is."
59:42;59:46;"But there might be other things that a young Tom York type might say."
59:46;59:49;"So maybe we gotta give him some sympathy, too."
59:49;59:51;"He was so young."
59:51;59:54;"If I had been in a huge rock band when I was 22,"
59:54;59:56;"I would have said some dumb things, too."
59:56;59:59;"But when he was 24, they weren't even that huge yet,"
59:59;01:00:01;"so he was probably even more edgy."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"The full context of that, it's not like modern-day Tom York"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"being asked about Kurt Cobain."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"It's kind of like young, one-hit wonder Tom York"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"being asked about a more respected singer."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"And it'd be like, ""Well, at least my girlfriend's not fat!"""
01:00:14;01:00:17;"It's like he was a member of Oasis back then."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Tom York, oh, yeah, yeah. Just talking."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Just sh*t talking."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Just brutal, taking the piss out of Kurt."
01:00:23;01:00:27;"Although, to be fair, I can't remember if I brought this up on Time Crisis before,"
01:00:27;01:00:30;"Kurt used to say unkind things about the dead."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"He wore a T-shirt that said, like..."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"- ""Kill the dead""? - ""Kill the dead. Kill the grateful dead."""
01:00:34;01:00:38;"- Lighten up, Kurt. - Yeah, so everybody's got to beat down on somebody else."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"# This is what I was thinking"
01:00:42;01:00:47;"# About our bodies"
01:00:47;01:00:51;"# What they mean"
01:00:52;01:00:56;"# For our salvation"
01:00:56;01:01:04;"# With only the clothes that"
01:01:04;01:01:09;"# We stand up in"
01:01:09;01:01:13;"# Just the ground"
01:01:13;01:01:17;"# On which we stand"
01:01:18;01:01:24;"# Is the darkness"
01:01:24;01:01:28;"# Ours to take"
01:01:28;01:01:33;"# Bathe in lightness"
01:01:33;01:01:37;"# Bathe in heat... #"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"It's interesting to think that in the early '90s,"
01:01:40;01:01:43;"a guy who'd gone on to be very influential, Tom York,"
01:01:43;01:01:47;"is out there calling Jim Morrison a fat, talentless bastard."
01:01:47;01:01:50;"And then ten years later, a new guy comes on the scene"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"who's going to have an even bigger impact on culture."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"His name's Kanye West, and he hears a song called ""521""."
01:01:56;01:02:00;"He says, ""You know what? I want to make a beat using this song."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"I'm going to have my good friend Jay-Z rap on it."""
01:02:02;01:02:04;"The rest is history, man. Ten years."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"It's a short time in some ways, in other ways it's a long time."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Jim Morrison went from being a punchline"
01:02:09;01:02:13;"to the backbone of a significant rap song"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"on a very special album"
01:02:15;01:02:18;"that brought a producer named Kanye West to prominence."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"Another ten years forward, Kanye is killing it."
01:02:21;01:02:24;"(laughs)"
01:02:24;01:02:28;"People love his world view in 2018."
01:02:28;01:02:30;"I watched SNL the other night."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Yeah, what did you think about that?"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"I thought the new songs just sucked."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"Although I did like the Perrier bottle costume."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"At least that was fun."
01:02:39;01:02:42;"I was like, ""What are these songs?"" He's just standing there."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"There's not much to say about it."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I even feel like all the ink spilled on Kanye."
01:02:46;01:02:49;"I see a lot of people who every time Kanye does something,"
01:02:49;01:02:52;"they're just like, ""When can we stop talking about Kanye?"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"I cancel him. He's done."""
01:02:54;01:02:57;"I'm just kind of like, ""Be the change, man. Be the f---ing change."""
01:02:57;01:03:01;"So anyway, I think if you really, really have a problem with Kanye,"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"my feeling is I don't think Kanye's convincing anybody"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"to support Donald Trump."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"Half of his audience is like, ""We're done with you,"""
01:03:08;01:03:11;"and the other half is like, ""Yeah, yeah. Can we hear the music?"""
01:03:11;01:03:15;"But the one kind of sad thing is that he's right about a few things."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"He's right about that he wants to challenge orthodoxy"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"and that there's got to be more than two sides"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"to the story of American politics."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Sure."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"The brutal part is that for such a forward-thinking guy, he can't find--"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"I get it if Kanye wants to say, ""Why should I be a Democrat?"""
01:03:30;01:03:32;"That's a great question, man."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Find a more forward-thinking answer. I'd love to know."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"Or a specific one. He's just like, ""Use your heart, not your head."""
01:03:38;01:03:43;"And it's like, ""Well, no, actually. You should use your head."""
01:03:43;01:03:45;"Use your head and your heart together."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Anyway, I got to say, maybe it's because he's dead,"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"but we've been talking about Tom York, Kanye--"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"-Cobain. -Cobain, Jim Morrison."
01:03:52;01:03:56;"I got to say, again, maybe just because door season is approaching,"
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Jim Morrison kind of seems increasingly like the coolest of the bunch, man."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"Let's throw in some more doors."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"What's some other good doors?"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"""Break on Through,"" that's already--"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"that was the first single, ""Out the Gate."""
01:04:08;01:04:12;"That [bleep] is hard. Another just [bleep] hard song."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Oh, dude, listen to that."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"It's like, what is this, jazz?"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"Garage rock?"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"♪ You know the day destroys the night ♪"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"♪ Night divides the day ♪"

01:55:26;01:55:29;"I don't want to f***ing participate in this world."
01:55:29;01:55:32;"I guess the good way to look at it is like you know what?"
01:55:32;01:55:36;"Maybe even if something's not that good to have everybody kind of rally around and be like"
01:55:36;01:55:39;"we're all going to kind of enjoy this thing and talk about it."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Maybe there's something good about that."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"You watching The Deuce?"
01:55:42;01:55:43;"No, is The Deuce good?"
01:55:43;01:55:44;"It's great."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Yeah?"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Nick's giving me a look."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"I just feel like..."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Well I'm a solo and I'm flying solo on this."
01:55:49;01:55:50;"I'm just starting to feel like..."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Best show on TV."
01:55:51;01:55:52;"All this just..."
01:55:52;01:55:55;"You know I feel like you always got to watch a new TV show."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"I know."
01:55:56;01:55:59;"Always going to be a new part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"Well I know I have a book on all that."
01:56:01;01:56:02;"New albums."
01:56:02;01:56:03;"I don't listen to music."
01:56:03;01:56:07;"I do think the only ethical form of content is internet radio."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"I'm sorry."
01:56:08;01:56:12;"In 2018 when there's just way too much content."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Just tune in to TC."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"There's just way too much content on the planet."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"The planet can't support this much content."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"It's frankly unethical to make content."
01:56:19;01:56:24;"And the only decent content is internet radio because it just comes and goes."
01:56:24;01:56:26;"It's not taking up space anywhere."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"It just streams and..."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"Except on a hard drive, bro."
01:56:29;01:56:31;"It's the only ethical form of content."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"Internet radio."
01:56:32;01:56:33;"I said it."
01:56:33;01:56:34;"Sorry, Lady Gaga."
01:56:34;01:56:37;"A Star is Born should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:37;01:56:40;"Succession should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:40;01:56:44;"The Carter Five by Lil Wayne should have been an internet radio show."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Well, hell of a program."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"I will say one thing."
01:56:48;01:56:52;"I love that the number one song on iTunes has like fake crowd sound and like..."
01:56:52;01:56:54;"That's tight."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Yeah."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"That song is cool."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Shout out to the writers."
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Andrew Wyatt, hell of a songwriter."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Mark Ronson, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Anthony Rosamondo, hell of a songwriter."
01:57:03;01:57:06;"Lady Gaga, hell of a--that's quite a quartet."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"I don't know this producer, Benjamin Rice."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Welcome to my life."
01:57:11;01:57:14;"Just the end of the song."
01:57:14;01:57:17;"Bah, bah, bah, bah."
01:57:17;01:57:22;"Welcome to my life."
01:57:22;01:57:25;"You could just add that to any song."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"All right."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"That's it for the time crisis."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"Come and gone."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Well, we covered some good ground."
01:57:32;01:57:33;"We'll see everybody in two weeks."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Peace."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:57:37;01:57:40;"Beats."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"One."
