00:00;00:08;"Are you a northern redneck? Perhaps. Do you like country stuff? We'll find out."
00:08;00:14;"On this episode of Time Crisis we talk about the 4th of July, Aaron Lewis,"
00:14;00:33;"Stained, BTS, and new music from Walker Hayes. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:11;01:20;"Time Crisis, back again. What's up Jake? Not much, it's bright and early. We're"
01:20;01:24;"doing this one early. I'm an undisclosed different time zone."
01:24;01:29;"But, well, okay. I guess if I said what I was gonna say would disclose where you"
01:29;01:34;"are. I'll just say this, it's early for us, it's not early for you. It's TC time"
01:34;01:42;"for you. I'm in Mountain Time. You're one hour ahead. I'm one hour ahead. I'm in the"
01:42;01:48;"MT. Which is the coolest time zone as discussed. The greatest time zone. Jake,"
01:48;01:53;"how was your 4th of July? Pretty good, pretty uneventful to be honest. Let's see,"
01:53;01:57;"what did I even do? Yeah, we're way past 4th of July. We're actually closer now to"
01:57;02:02;"Bastille Day. I don't know if you guys celebrate that. What is that again? Wait,"
02:02;02:06;"Seinfeld, do you celebrate Bastille Day given that you come from a Francophone"
02:06;02:12;"land? I do not celebrate Bastille Day. I was just looking it up actually. I also"
02:12;02:17;"don't know a lot about it to be honest with you. Nick, not a Bastille Day guy?"
02:17;02:26;"Not in my house. Are you a Bastille Day guy? It begs the question. You know, it's"
02:26;02:32;"We're off to a rip-roaring start here guys. We are hot out of the gates today. It's kind of"
02:32;02:35;"weird when we're not in the same times and I'm bringing that mountain energy."
02:35;02:41;"Right. You guys are on that Pacific. Well, you know sometimes there's like a"
02:41;02:45;"fact that you really don't know that much about but you just like remember it."
02:45;02:49;"It's a little bit in the same zone as knowing that the first podcast was a"
02:49;02:54;"Grateful Dead song. You know, you come out hot with that and people are like, wow,"
02:54;02:58;"this guy knows some facts and then they sinks in. They say, well, what does that"
02:58;03:03;"mean? You say, I don't really know but it's true. I know that July 14th is"
03:03;03:08;"Bastille Day. Sometime in my childhood or school or something, I just"
03:08;03:13;"remember that because it has something to do with the French Revolution. The"
03:13;03:18;"Bastille was stormed. Whatever the Bastille was, they stormed it and I just"
03:18;03:23;"think I remembered, okay, so that's like a big Independence Day-esque celebration"
03:23;03:29;"in France and it's 10 days after the 4th of July. So, I always remember that July"
03:29;03:34;"14th is Bastille Day and I think, Seinfeld, do they have fireworks on"
03:34;03:39;"Bastille Day? Well, I'm on the Wikipedia page and there the main image is the"
03:39;03:44;"Eiffel Tower with fireworks all around it. So, there you have it folks. These are"
03:44;03:50;"two of the major July fireworks based holidays in the Western world. If you're"
03:50;03:56;"a fireworks head, you could like party on July 4th in the States somewhere and"
03:56;04:01;"then go to France. Ooh. Catch that show at the Eiffel on the 14th. I'm sure there"
04:01;04:07;"actually are like wealthy fireworks heads. People who are into like city"
04:07;04:13;"sanctioned firework shows. Well, and also they have to be Independence themed. Like"
04:13;04:16;"somebody's just talking like, ""Oh, do you ever go down at Disney World? They really"
04:16;04:19;"have a hell of a firework show every night."" And it's like, no, it's got no heart."
04:19;04:25;"It has to actually reference some type of political violence. That's the reason"
04:25;04:30;"why we set off the fireworks. Full disclosure, I'm a fireworks head that I'm"
04:30;04:36;"actually in France. I came out here for Bastille Day. I caught as"
04:36;04:41;"many shows as I could in the Los Angeles area for the 4th. Then I drove"
04:41;04:45;"cross-country and got on the fast boat to France."

06:09;06:11;"Okay, but Jake, back to this 4th of July."
06:11;06:12;"Yeah."
06:12;06:16;"Oh wait, you know what? I think the last episode was basically on- did it air on the 4th of July?"
06:16;06:18;"Oh yeah, it was a Sunday."
06:18;06:22;"We really sh*t the bed on that one. Zero reference."
06:22;06:22;"Oh yeah."
06:22;06:25;"The last episode had zero reference to the 4th of July."
06:25;06:28;"Okay, so did you get up to anything? Grilling?"
06:28;06:34;"Yeah, now I'm remembering. We took Lizzie to our friend Morgan's house."
06:34;06:34;"Uh-huh. I heard about this."
06:34;06:38;"He was barbecuing, and there was like a ton of kids there."
06:38;06:45;"Like all of a sudden, as soon as we've had a daughter, like you just gravitate towards the people that also have kids."
06:45;06:51;"And then she usually gets really cranky and wants to go to sleep at 6.30."
06:51;06:56;"So it's like you go there at 4, and at 6 o'clock she had a major meltdown."
06:56;06:57;"So we bailed."
06:57;06:59;"Oh, you didn't make it to the fireworks."
06:59;07:04;"Oh no. But you know what? I don't care about fireworks. I don't like them. They're boring."
07:04;07:05;"You're straight up anti-fireworks?"
07:05;07:10;"I'm anti. So then we got home, put her to bed, and then we were watching-"
07:10;07:14;"Speaking of France, we were watching some episodes of the show The Bureau."
07:14;07:18;"There were fireworks going on outside in our neighborhood. There's a ton of them always."
07:18;07:25;"We walked outside in the middle of them, you know, when it was dark at 8 or 9 o'clock, and watched them for like 15 seconds."
07:25;07:28;"And then we were both like, ""Okay, I'm good."""
07:28;07:32;"Very kind of Larry David, kind of like, ""Yeah, eh. They're boring."""
07:32;07:36;"I feel like if you're right underneath fireworks, they can be kind of exciting."
07:36;07:43;"My memories of driving to a football field or something as a kid and really feeling underneath it."
07:43;07:44;"Yeah, when you're a kid."
07:44;07:45;"Kind of exciting."
07:45;07:46;"Yeah."
07:46;07:49;"All right, so nothing particularly patriotic."
07:49;07:58;"I'm just a jaded, tired adult. I don't have room in my heart for sincere excitement around fireworks."
07:58;08:02;"Well, you sound like almost the polar opposite of Aaron Lewis."
08:02;08:04;"(laughs)"
08:04;08:09;"That is true. It seems like the 4th is his favorite holiday. Did that song come out on the 4th?"
08:09;08:16;"Well, this is... Okay, it came out on the 2nd. So, that was my rough transition into something I wanted to talk about."
08:16;08:25;"Because even though at some point on this show, we moved the top 5 from the top 5 songs on iTunes to the top 5 songs on Apple Music."
08:25;08:33;"And it made sense at the time. I'm starting to wonder if it's a mistake because there's a lot of weird energy still hanging out on iTunes."
08:33;08:36;"What's the difference? Is iTunes just a store where you buy stuff?"
08:36;08:40;"iTunes is like the old school MP3 store."
08:40;08:40;"Right."
08:40;08:43;"Which clearly some people still use."
08:43;08:43;"Right."
08:43;08:50;"That might have been one of the dominant forms of digital music consumption 10, 15 years ago."
08:50;08:57;"But, you know, these days, the average person, they're streaming it. They're streaming it on Apple Music."
08:57;08:59;"You don't need that physical release."
08:59;09:00;"(laughs)"
09:00;09:03;"Don't always need the physical release, depending on what it is."
09:03;09:09;"But sometimes you want a middle ground between the physical release and just streaming it once."
09:09;09:14;"So, I still look at the iTunes store and I just know - I looked over there and I was like,"
09:14;09:18;"""This is a different universe than a lot of what we're getting on the top 5 Apple Music."""
09:18;09:22;"I mean, probably a smaller group of people, different audience."
09:22;09:25;"But I saw this song was up there at number 1."
09:25;09:27;"And I saw the name was Aaron Lewis."
09:27;09:31;"And at first, I'm thinking, ""Is that the guy from Stained?"""
09:31;09:36;"It's like ringing a vague, a soft bell in my head."
09:36;09:43;"And I see the song as I'm the only one and some kind of American flag on the cover of the single."
09:43;09:45;"So, I was like, ""What is this?"""
09:45;09:50;"And then I checked the song out and I said, ""Okay, this is basically a conservative country song"
09:50;09:54;"from the guy from Stained who looms large."""
09:54;09:56;"And I don't think we've talked about enough on the show."
09:56;09:59;"I'm sure at some point we've talked about the huge Stained hit."
09:59;10:01;"""It's been a while."""
10:01;10:04;"One of the most legendary lines of the past 30 years."
10:04;10:07;"Infrequently sung in conversation."
10:07;10:10;"Like if you haven't seen someone in a while,"
10:10;10:12;"""Hey man, haven't seen you in a minute."""
10:12;10:14;"And the other guy goes, ""Been a while."""
10:14;10:16;"Exactly."
10:16;10:17;"I've definitely done that."
10:17;10:19;"Yeah, I definitely associate that with you."
10:19;10:23;"And it's also like for rock guys like us, of course, we know it."
10:23;10:27;"But a lot of people, even if they were around back then,"
10:27;10:30;"they may not be totally familiar with that song."
10:30;10:35;"And I find it hard if I hear the phrase, if somebody just says, ""Oh, it's been a while."""
10:35;10:37;"To not go, ""It's been a while."""
10:37;10:39;"But every once in a while, you'll just get somebody to be like,"
10:39;10:42;"""Just picture you don't actually know what that song is."""
10:42;10:48;"Like, it's very possible like Rashida has no idea what that song is."
10:48;10:51;"You know, just like, ""Oh yeah, I'd love to do that. It's been a while."""
10:51;10:53;"I'm just like, ""It's been a while."""
10:53;10:56;"What? Hit him with a zero context, ""It's been a while."""
10:56;11:00;"It's like your own version of Tourette's or something."
11:00;11:02;"You can't help it."
11:02;11:04;"I can't stop quoting Stained."
11:04;11:07;"Just like in the most inappropriate moments."
11:07;11:10;"True life. I can't quit."
11:10;11:13;"I can't stop singing Stained."
11:13;11:18;"In class, professors just like, ""It's great to finally not be on Zoom anymore, guys."
11:18;11:20;"It's nice to see all you. It's been a while."""
11:20;11:24;"I'm just like back at the lecture hall, ""It's been a while!"""
11:24;11:26;"Excuse me?"
11:26;11:31;"Just like sitting on a park bench by yourself"
11:31;11:34;"and you can kind of hear what the people across the way are talking about"
11:34;11:37;"and you hear one of them use the phrase, ""It's been a while!"""
11:37;11:39;"You're like, ""Oh my God, were you listening to us?"""
11:39;11:41;"""Not really. I just heard that phrase."""
11:41;11:44;"""Oh, why did you say it that way?"""
11:44;11:47;"""Jesus Christ, get away from us, officer."""
11:47;11:51;"I have a medical compulsion to sing that if I hear that phrase."
11:51;11:54;"That'd be a really hardcore Mandela effect too."
11:54;11:58;"I'm sure most TC heads are familiar with the concept of the Mandela effect."
11:58;12:02;"A lot of people have these memories, often associated with pop culture,"
12:02;12:05;"that the historical record doesn't back up."
12:05;12:11;"So there's many people out there who swore that Nelson Mandela died in prison."
12:11;12:16;"Whereas the historical record tells us that Nelson Mandela was freed from prison"
12:16;12:19;"and became the president of South Africa."
12:19;12:21;"So they call it the Mandela effect."
12:21;12:24;"A lot of people get together and say, ""I remember it that way too."""
12:24;12:28;"""What's up with that? Maybe we've got some kind of multiverse thing happening."""
12:28;12:32;"But I'm imagining one where millions of people around the world"
12:32;12:37;"remember a song from the late '90s, early 2000s called ""It's Been A While"""
12:37;12:39;"and every time they hear the phrase, they go, ""It's been a while."""
12:39;12:44;"But the historical record shows no evidence that there was ever a song called ""It's Been A While"""
12:44;12:46;"or that there was ever a band called ""Stained."""
12:46;12:50;"Somehow, tens of millions of people around the world have this shared memory."
12:50;12:52;"That would be the Mandela effect version."
12:52;12:55;"Yeah, or there would be a real glitch in the multiverse."
12:55;12:58;"That's my pitch for a Black Mirror episode."
12:58;13:00;"It's just like, ""Thanks for your submission."""
13:00;13:03;"I don't think you totally understand what Black Mirror is about."
13:03;13:05;"It's usually about technology."
13:05;13:08;"It'd be like, ""Music is a technology, sir."""
13:08;13:12;"""Mr. Brooker, music is a technology."""
13:12;13:15;"It'd be like a weirdo version of that movie ""Yesterday."""
13:15;13:16;"Yeah."
13:16;13:21;"Where the whole world has forgotten the Beatles catalog except for one dude."
13:21;13:27;"But this is a reverse where somehow the whole world starts going, ""It's been a while."""
13:27;13:33;"There's only one dude who doesn't remember the ""Stained"" song and he's very confused."
13:33;13:34;"Yeah."
13:34;13:37;"I like the idea of going to the creators of Black Mirror"
13:37;13:41;"and pitching them a lot of time crisis weirdo ideas."
13:41;13:43;"Yeah, ""Juice Island."""
13:45;13:50;"Didn't we have a whole thing once that was like, ""Members of One Direction."""
13:50;13:51;"It was like a movie."
13:51;13:55;"""Members of One Direction were working on Nantucket or something."""
13:55;13:56;"Yeah."
13:56;13:58;"Can I get a number crunch?"
13:58;14:00;"That sounds very familiar, but yeah."
14:00;14:02;"Let me crunch some numbers here."
14:02;14:07;"Just rolling up super serious for a big pitch meeting for Black Mirror."
14:07;14:11;"And they're just like, ""All right, guys. What you got?"""
14:11;14:14;"And we just start hitting them with ""Juice Island."""
14:14;14:17;"Just the most boneheaded DC stuff."
14:17;14:22;"And he's like, ""Guys, you really don't understand what Black Mirror is about."""
14:22;14:26;"And we're like, ""We get it, man. It's about a kind of alternate reality."
14:26;14:30;"It's about technology. Music is a technology."
14:30;14:32;"And it's about something that's not quite right."""
14:32;14:35;"""Oh, yeah. We get it, man. We put a lot of thought into these ideas."""
14:35;14:40;"He's like, ""That's not okay, but no, it's got to be about computers or some sh*t."""
14:40;14:43;"""No, man. We thought about that. No, no, no. We're one step ahead of you."""
14:43;14:45;"""Guacamole technology."""
14:45;14:47;"[Laughter]"
14:47;14:49;"We should make our own Black Mirror."
14:49;14:52;"Okay. Our own Black Mirror is called Green Mirror."
14:52;14:56;"And it's all kind of horror stories involving guacamole technology."
14:56;14:57;"How about that?"
14:57;14:58;"There we go."
14:58;15:03;"Niall Horan from One Direction's attempt to capture the tones of the early '80s Don Henley"
15:03;15:06;"sparks a fantasy movie called New Directions"
15:06;15:10;"about a recently widowed Jake running a hardware store in Nantucket."
15:10;15:16;"He finds true camaraderie with the '70s palette-obsessed former Direction members of One Direction."
15:16;15:17;"Wow."
15:17;15:22;"Leaves his chain-smokers-listening daughter in charge of the store while he goes on a world tour with the lads."
15:22;15:25;"[Laughter]"
15:25;15:26;"Charlie Brooker."
15:26;15:29;"Charlie Brooker, what do you think, man?"
15:29;15:30;"[Laughter]"
15:30;15:32;"Okay, guys."
15:32;15:35;"Have you ever seen an episode of Black Mirror?"
15:35;15:37;"Yes, sir. Absolutely."
15:37;15:41;"Black Mirror, they did that whole movie that took place in the '80s."
15:41;15:45;"What was that called about the video game developers?"
15:45;15:47;"Bandersnatch."
15:47;15:48;"Bandersnatch."
15:48;15:51;"Mr. Brooker, we know you got a soft spot for the 1980s,"
15:51;15:53;"and so we really cooked something up,"
15:53;15:56;"and we're going to dip a little bit into the tasteful palette of the '70s, too."
16:51;16:55;"Okay, maybe it's not—we just got to start our own show, Green Mirror."
16:55;17:00;"It's mostly stories about kind of what-ifs about musicians."
17:00;17:04;"Wait, Green Mirror isn't mostly about guacamole technology?"
17:04;17:08;"The first episode was about guacamole technology gone wrong,"
17:08;17:14;"and then the rest of them just tend to be about what if Don Henley went solo a few years earlier."
17:14;17:16;"A little more oddball."
17:16;17:17;"Yeah."
17:17;17:18;"It's on right after Gentle—"
17:18;17:19;"That's so menacing."
17:19;17:21;"It's on right after Gentle Jesters."
17:21;17:24;"It's like, yeah, it's a kind vibe Black Mirror."
17:24;17:26;"It's the slowest two hours on TV."
17:26;17:29;"Gentle Jesters into Green Mirror."
17:29;17:30;"[Laughter]"
17:30;17:31;"The whole family can watch it."
17:31;17:32;"I like this movie."
17:32;17:36;"I just—I do like this meeting with him where we're like, you know, we know."
17:36;17:37;"We know the show well."
17:37;17:41;"We're just saying, what if technology isn't so bad?"
17:41;17:42;"Right."
17:42;17:43;"It's not good."
17:43;17:44;"It's just not so bad."
17:44;17:46;"That's our Black Mirror."
17:46;17:49;"We think that would make an interesting show."
17:49;17:53;"Sort of a centrist, like a centrist Black Mirror."
17:53;17:54;"[Laughter]"
17:54;17:56;"It's agnostic."
17:56;17:58;"We're not taking a hard line on technology."
17:58;18:00;"It's really what our version of the show is."
18:00;18:01;"It's nuanced."
18:01;18:06;"Yeah, or just like get an interview with Charlie Brooker and just come in like really aggressive."
18:06;18:11;"Just being like, so your whole show is about this kind of skepticism about where technology is taking us."
18:11;18:17;"Are you aware, sir, that the word technology could refer to basically anything?"
18:17;18:20;"Even something as simple as making guacamole?"
18:20;18:22;"He's like, yes."
18:22;18:24;"Well, defend yourself."
18:24;18:30;"And he's like, I'm talking about modern kind of digital technology, information technology."
18:30;18:31;"All right."
18:31;18:32;"Fair point."
18:32;18:39;"It's amazing how often that movie Yesterday comes up in conversation when—I don't know if any of us have seen it."
18:39;18:40;"I haven't."
18:40;18:41;"I watched it on a plane."
18:41;18:42;"It's a very durable concept."
18:42;18:45;"They could also make—how about this for a streaming service?"
18:45;18:49;"Yesterday the series, every episode's about a different artist."
18:49;18:51;"[Laughter]"
18:51;18:58;"You get into like season four and it's like, dude wakes up and the world's forgotten about the catalog of Boston."
18:58;19:04;"Yeah, a lot of the episodes are just a very confused person just trying to figure out if they can actually do anything with it."
19:04;19:12;"Or just like a super—somebody who knows nothing about music, like super tone deaf, and they just like wake up in a world where like—"
19:12;19:20;"I'm just trying to think of just like some really just kind of like solid but like not particularly beloved like one hit wonder."
19:20;19:23;"Yeah, like how long would it take them to figure that out even?"
19:23;19:24;"It could be like years."
19:24;19:25;"Oh, Gautier?"
19:25;19:30;"Gautier is an interesting fellow because I don't think he ever followed up that album."
19:30;19:33;"So that makes him a hall of famer in my eyes."
19:33;19:36;"I respect the slow pace."
19:36;19:38;"It wouldn't be fair to call him a one hit wonder."
19:38;19:41;"I don't know, what's like a big one hit wonder from like—"
19:41;19:43;"Dancing in the Moonlight by King Harvest."
19:43;19:45;"Yeah, okay, perfect."
19:45;19:53;"Dancing in the Moonlight by King Harvest, although there was a massive version of it in the UK in the 90s, did not cross over in the US at all."
19:53;19:58;"So in a way, this Britpop band called Toploader kind of already did it."
19:58;20:00;"Huh, I never heard that."
20:00;20:01;"Throw on Toploader."
20:01;20:08;"For Gen X English people, this is like one of the biggest songs of their youth."
20:08;20:09;"Really?"
20:09;20:14;"So this band is a one hit wonder with a cover, which I respect."
20:14;20:27;"What a funny trailer. The whole trailer is the guy wakes up and this song."
20:27;20:29;"Never happened."
20:29;20:36;"An English guy wakes up and Toploader—the original did happen, but Toploader didn't cover it in the 90s."
20:36;20:38;"That's even deeper."
20:38;20:44;"He has this deep feeling that English people would freak out for a new version of Dancing in the Moonlight."
20:44;20:49;"But he keeps telling people about Dancing in the Moonlight and they're like, ""No, no, it did come out."""
20:49;20:51;"And he's like, ""No, no, no."""
20:51;20:54;"No, but the Toploader version never came out."
21:07;21:12;"You'd have to have the scene where he's been in this new reality for six months."
21:12;21:16;"He's in a coffee shop and they're playing the King Harvest version."
21:16;21:20;"And he goes, ""It's been a while since I've heard this song."""
21:20;21:24;"But, you know, I really love the 90s Top Sider version."
21:24;21:27;"And then someone's like, ""What's that? What do you mean? That's the reveal."""
21:27;21:31;"And then he's like, ""Well, you know, it was covered in the 90s. I've never heard that."""
21:31;21:33;"Then he starts asking everyone."
21:33;21:35;"Wait, wait, you're kidding me."
21:35;21:42;"Wait, Seinfeld, can you tell me the Toploader version of Dancing in the Moonlight, how high did that chart?"
21:42;21:45;"Toploader? That's a weird name."
21:45;21:47;"Have you ever heard of the band, Jake?"
21:47;21:49;"No, I had no idea this existed."
21:53;21:58;"It peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100."
21:58;21:59;"It went to 13?"
21:59;22:00;"That's deep."
22:00;22:02;"Wait, wait, you're looking at the Toploader version?"
22:02;22:06;"No, I'm looking at the King Harvest. My bad. Sorry, guys."
22:06;22:09;"Seinfeld's already living in a world where Toploader's cover never happened."
22:09;22:12;"I think this is a little slower than the original."
22:12;22:14;"Okay, you know what, Seinfeld? I found it, don't worry."
22:14;22:15;"All right."
22:15;22:19;"It peaked at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, so it wasn't number one."
22:19;22:25;"It's been certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, so that's a big hit."
22:25;22:26;"What year was it?"
22:26;22:32;"It was actually 2000. It's not 90. Almost 90. It was February 2000."
22:44;22:50;"And then also, if you could pull out a triple platinum hit out of your pocket,"
22:50;22:56;"obviously, you could make some money, but it's just one song."
22:56;23:00;"Are you going to dedicate your whole life to recreating that one hit?"
23:00;23:07;"Also, it would be many years after the Toploader hit actually happened."
23:07;23:11;"You're supposing that if the show is set in 2021,"
23:11;23:14;"and this guy discovers that Toploader never happened,"
23:14;23:17;"that he could somehow turn dancing in the moonlight into a massive hit."
23:17;23:18;"A massive hit now."
23:18;23:22;"The whole point of the Beatles movie is that those songs are timeless."
23:22;23:24;"Yeah, that's a good song."
23:24;23:30;"Right, Jake, you wake up tomorrow, and the Space Hog song, In the Meantime, never came out."
23:30;23:31;"Great song."
23:34;23:38;"But you wake up tomorrow, and you find out that that song never came out."
23:38;23:42;"It would probably take you probably a decade to find out that that song had never come out."
23:42;23:43;"Right."
23:43;23:46;"You quietly slipped onto a different timeline, and you didn't even know."
23:46;23:47;"Right."
23:47;23:49;"That's what the Mandela effect is, actually."
23:49;23:53;"I might not ever find out, because I do hear that song occasionally,"
23:53;23:57;"and when I do, I'm delighted, because it's a great song."
23:57;24:00;"But if I never heard it again..."
24:00;24:02;"You'd never look it up on Apple Music, for example."
24:02;24:05;"It would never occur to me to look it up."
24:05;24:11;"Maybe one day you're doing Jake's 90s alt-rock radio phase,"
24:11;24:13;"and you're like, ""Where's that Space Hog song at?"""
24:13;24:16;"And it's like, ""Huh, I guess they're not on Apple Music. It's not streaming."""
24:16;24:19;"And then you go to Wikipedia, or you look for it on YouTube."
24:19;24:22;"You're like, ""Not on YouTube either. I guess it must be a copyright thing."""
24:22;24:24;"And then you're just like, ""When did that come out?"""
24:24;24:26;"And you type Space Hog into Wikipedia."
24:26;24:28;"Nothing. Now you're sweating."
24:28;24:30;"You're getting that weird pit in your stomach."
24:30;24:34;"And then you call your brother, ""Dave, remember Space Hog?"""
24:34;24:36;"""Remember Space Hog?"""
24:36;24:40;"""No. Remember that song, 'Doon Doon Doon'?"""
24:40;24:42;"""In the meantime?"""
24:42;24:46;"""Dave, I know it's probably been a while, but do you remember Space Hog?"""
24:46;24:50;"""No, you just started calling every rock dude you know in your phone book."""
24:50;24:56;"You know what's funny? I would have no idea when I slipped onto that alternate timeline."
24:56;25:01;"It might have happened yesterday, or it might have happened 10 years ago."
25:01;25:04;"That's really insidious. This is perfect for Green Mirror."
25:04;25:07;"I have a version."
25:07;25:10;"Hold on. Real quick. Then part two."
25:10;25:15;"Once you calm down, you realize that the multiverse theory is real, whatever."
25:15;25:18;"And you're like, ""Whatever. Everything else is business as usual. I'm not going to sweat it."""
25:18;25:22;"But now you're saying to yourself, ""That was a great song."
25:22;25:24;"What are you going to do with it in 2021?"
25:24;25:27;"Are you going to just throw it on the next Mountain Bruise EP?"""
25:27;25:30;"Are you going to be like, ""I'm putting that on the next Mountain Bruise EP."""
25:30;25:33;"Or are you going to be like, ""I'm really going to work this one."
25:33;25:37;"I'm going to hire a radio team because I know."""
25:37;25:44;"The funny thing is that in the movie, he's a songwriter and he remembers all the Beatles songs."
25:44;25:47;"We all remember the Beatles songs."
25:47;25:50;"I remember the Space Hog song, but I don't remember it that well."
25:50;25:55;"I remember he just goes, ""And when the birdland knows where."""
25:55;25:58;"I don't remember any of the lyrics."
25:58;26:02;"It's built around a sample."
26:02;26:10;"It's a Penguin Cafe Orchestra sample of a dial tone that goes, ""Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."""
26:10;26:12;"Ezra clearly knows the song better."
26:12;26:15;"I have a different scenario of how this movie comes about."
26:15;26:18;"It's essentially what we're doing here."
26:18;26:21;"And this is very Green Mirror because we're already connected."
26:21;26:24;"Because we're all separated, we're connected on FaceTime."
26:24;26:26;"We're having the radio show."
26:26;26:28;"We're talking about yesterday."
26:28;26:32;"And then Ezra says, ""Like the Space Hog song."""
26:32;26:36;"We all go, ""What are you talking about?"""
26:36;26:38;"And you're like, ""You know the Space Hog song."""
26:38;26:41;"In the meantime, we're like, ""We don't know what you're talking about."""
26:41;26:42;"And you're like, ""Matt, pull it up."
26:42;26:44;"Matt, we don't know what you're talking about."
26:44;26:47;"There's no Space Hog song called 'Ain't No Man.'"""
26:47;26:48;"And not seeing it."
26:48;26:50;"And then you have to make a decision at this moment."
26:50;26:54;"""Oh, sorry. Had a brain fart. That isn't a song."""
26:54;27:00;"And you make the decision now that Vampire Weekend can put out in the meantime."
27:00;27:03;"You have a moment where no one knows the song."
27:03;27:05;"And you're like, ""Oh, I have this thing that is mine."""
27:05;27:08;"And now you actually do have to then also contend with the fact"
27:08;27:11;"that you've slipped into an alternate timeline"
27:11;27:14;"where things are going but that song doesn't exist."
27:14;27:18;"You are still in a band that has a huge platform."
27:18;27:20;"You're a songwriter. You do know the music."
27:20;27:23;"I'm sitting there with Arielle who wouldn't remember the song"
27:23;27:25;"either if it doesn't exist in this timeline."
27:25;27:27;"And I'm playing it for him."
27:27;27:30;"And he's just like, ""It sounds like a little '90s, dude."""
27:30;27:36;"And I'll be like, ""Uh, okay. Good call. That's true."
27:36;27:38;"Goodyear, man. That's what I was referencing."
27:38;27:42;"Guilty as charged. I was going for a bit of a '90s thing."
27:42;27:45;"But yeah, let's just freshen it up for 2021."""
27:45;27:48;"And I'll just be like, ""I mean, yeah. What'd you have in mind?"""
27:48;27:52;"And I'll be like, ""Um, yeah. I wonder if what I could--"
27:52;27:54;"Okay, we got to listen to it now."""
27:54;27:57;"And then, of course, the movie's called In the Meantime."

32:39;32:41;"So we can just redo the movie."
32:41;32:45;"I was just thinking that too, that we do a movie where the movie yesterday doesn't exist."
32:45;32:47;"Actually, that'd be a good movie."
32:47;32:51;"It's kind of like a doc-style Hollywood insider film"

32:55;32:58;"Basically, the whole world wakes up tomorrow,"
32:58;33:02;"and nobody remembers the movie yesterday,"
33:02;33:08;"except for just one random dude from small town anywhere USA."
33:08;33:11;"And he's like, ""I have a great idea for a movie."""
33:11;33:15;"He kind of tells some of his friends, they're like, ""That's a pretty good idea."
33:15;33:20;"Yeah, maybe if, you know, linked up with like an English production company,"
33:20;33:25;"obviously you'd need the blessing of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and all that."
33:25;33:28;"But, you know, I think that is a really good idea."""
33:28;33:30;"He's got all the beats sketched out,"
33:30;33:35;"and then it's just like this dude from small town is like, ""Um, alright, what's next?"""
33:35;33:38;"And just starts emailing studios,"
33:38;33:40;"and people are just like, ""Do you have the rights to the music?"""
33:40;33:42;"And he's like, ""No, of course not."
33:42;33:44;"But I really think if I could get in there with Sir Paul,"
33:44;33:46;"and I really pitch him the story beat by beat,"
33:46;33:48;"I think he would agree that this is a great film."""
33:48;33:51;"People are like, ""What the f*** are you talking about?"""
33:51;33:57;"And it's just like this kind of weird seven year odyssey of this guy just trying to get Yesterday made."
33:57;34:00;"And then eventually, I would think eventually this guy,"
34:00;34:02;"he'd probably just start telling people,"
34:02;34:08;"""Listen, I'm from an alternate timeline, and this movie was a moderate hit."""

34:12;34:13;"Big hit?"

34:15;34:16;"Smash?"
34:16;34:17;"Yeah, it was a smash success."
34:17;34:24;"It made $153 million against a budget of $26 to $41.3 million."
34:24;34:29;"So it made back its production, the advertising."

34:32;34:35;"Okay, forget about the movie, but here's the thing."

34:37;34:40;"The budget can be roughly $30 something."
34:40;34:43;"I'm telling you, this can work."
34:43;34:46;"We can have a very healthy profit margin."
34:46;34:49;"And I'm the only person who has this idea."
34:49;34:51;"Just a very painful film."
34:51;34:52;"Yeah."
34:52;34:58;"But does this person have a copy of the film on DVD or something?"
34:58;35:00;"Or is it like they're trying to cobble together from the beginning?"
35:00;35:02;"No, it's just like the movie."
35:02;35:03;"It's Jake."
35:03;35:05;"You saw it once on a plane."
35:05;35:06;"It's Jake."
35:06;35:11;"So now he's trying to piece it back together as faithfully as possible."
35:11;35:12;"Oh, you know what?"
35:12;35:14;"He starts making it on an iPhone."
35:14;35:19;"I have to make this short to get it into a festival so that I can maybe get an agent."
35:19;35:21;"I'm starting from the ground floor here."
35:21;35:24;"This is going to be a long journey."
35:24;35:26;"No, I'm just remembering now."
35:26;35:29;"I think we got a bunch of emails about this."
35:29;35:33;"There was a scene in that movie that steals a time crisis joke."
35:33;35:35;"Ed Sheeran."
35:35;35:42;"Because Ed Sheeran has a scene in the movie, and the guy is showing him his song called ""Hey Jude"" that he's just written."
35:42;35:45;"And Ed Sheeran's like, ""Wow, that's an amazing song, mate."
35:45;35:48;"Just one suggestion. What if it was 'Hey Dude'?"""
35:48;35:54;"And at some point, I guess on the show, I have a vague memory of it."
35:54;36:00;"We had this whole riff about what if the song was ""Hey Dude."""
36:00;36:05;"Because I remember we were doing the top five from 1968 a lot."
36:05;36:08;"Oh yeah, we heard that quite a few times."
36:08;36:14;"In those years, in 2016 or something, we did 1968 every show for a few months."
36:14;36:18;"""Hey Jude"" was in there for weeks and weeks."
36:18;36:25;"That was a stretch back in 1998 where on ""Time Crisis"" we did the 30-year tribute to the year 1968."
36:25;36:28;"That's when we were still on Berklee Public Radio."
36:28;36:30;"That was before we were on the internet."
36:30;36:31;"Great period of the show."
36:31;36:37;"Hey Jude, don't make it bad"
36:37;36:44;"Take a sad song and make it better"
36:44;36:49;"Remember to let her into your heart"
36:49;36:56;"Then you can start to make it better"
36:56;37:03;"Hey Jude, don't be afraid"
37:03;37:10;"You were made to go out and get her"
37:10;37:15;"The minute you let her under your skin"
37:15;37:24;"Then you begin to make it better"
37:24;37:27;"And anytime you feel the pain"
37:27;37:30;"Hey Jude, refrain"
37:30;37:40;"Don't carry the world upon your shoulder"
37:40;37:43;"For well you know that it's a fool"
37:43;37:46;"Who plays it cool"
37:46;37:54;"By making his world a little colder"
37:54;37:57;"Na na na na na"
37:57;38:00;"Na na na na"
38:00;38:02;"Okay, one last idea."
38:02;38:03;"How about this?"
38:03;38:08;"A documentary that's about a guy, not in a different timeline, in our timeline."
38:08;38:10;"It's straight up a documentary."
38:10;38:15;"Maybe you get somebody kind of well-known."
38:15;38:18;"Some decently successful person."
38:18;38:20;"Seth Rogen or something."
38:20;38:23;"Somebody who could get a meeting with whoever they want."
38:23;38:26;"Go to all the studio heads, Netflix and whatever."
38:26;38:30;"It's like a 20-minute documentary where he just goes and pitches the movie ""Yesterday""."
38:30;38:32;"But they remember the movie ""Yesterday""."
38:32;38:36;"But then he'll be like, ""I've never heard of that. That didn't happen."""
38:36;38:39;"It's a little bit like a Gentle Jester segment."
38:39;38:41;"Where I'm in the coffee shop."
38:41;38:43;"Straight up, this is a Gentle Jester segment."
38:43;38:45;"God, Bob Dylan's the best, right?"
38:45;38:46;"Okay, you know what it is?"
38:46;38:48;"This is the celebrity version, right?"
38:48;38:50;"When we tried bringing in celebrities to do something."
38:50;38:53;"Exactly. This is a Gentle Jester's episode where we get Paul McCartney on."
38:53;39:00;"And basically the whole bit is that we send Paul McCartney to meetings with powerful, highly weird executives."
39:00;39:02;"And Paul pitches them."
39:02;39:06;"He's sitting there with the head of Amazon or whatever."
39:06;39:09;"And Paul's like, ""Alright, so the idea..."""
39:09;39:11;"Oh God, I can't do it at all."
39:11;39:12;"I'm just going to do an American accent."
39:12;39:14;"""Alright, so here's the idea, man."
39:14;39:17;"Imagine a world where all of our beloved songs don't exist."
39:17;39:20;"There's only one guy, young fella."
39:20;39:22;"He's the only one who remembers our music."
39:22;39:25;"And he uses our songs to become a superstar."
39:25;39:28;"But he was a songwriter, so he has to wrestle with his own feelings of self-worth."""
39:28;39:32;"And the guy's like, ""Oh, Paul, that sounds like the movie 'Yesterday'."""
39:32;39:34;"No. Never in a million years."
39:34;39:35;"Never in a million years."
39:35;39:37;"This is a brilliant idea."
39:37;39:40;"Because if it's Paul McCartney, they'll never ever say it."
39:40;39:41;"They'll never correct him."
39:41;39:45;"They'll be so excited to be in a room with Paul McCartney that when he starts walking through..."
39:45;39:48;"And the more they are like, ""Oh, interesting idea,"""
39:48;39:51;"knowing full well it's a movie and they'll wait for him to leave being like,"
39:51;39:53;"""Did he have a stroke? What's going on?"""
39:53;39:57;"He has to keep walking through the beats, basically, of the movie."
39:57;39:59;"And so I've sort of beaded it out already."
39:59;40:01;"So it's like he wakes up and just..."
40:01;40:03;"They'll never stop him."
40:03;40:05;"He'll be too embarrassed."
40:05;40:07;"So he'll get to just walk through the whole movie and go,"
40:07;40:09;"""So, are we looking at a green light?"""
40:09;40:11;"We're really excited here, Paul."
40:11;40:14;"Okay. That's perfect for Gentle Jesters."
40:14;40:21;"It's actually so painful to think about that moment that it's almost too not gentle."
40:21;40:24;"That could become a go-to Gentle Jesters segment,"
40:24;40:27;"is that we get various classic rock legends."
40:27;40:32;"Yeah, maybe the next episode, it's Bruce Springsteen also pitching ""Yesterday."""
40:32;40:34;"Except he's actually pitching it about the Beatles."
40:34;40:38;"They're like, ""Wait, Bruce, do you mean the movie 'Yesterday' but with your songs?"""
40:38;40:40;"""No, no, no. This has nothing to do with my songs."
40:40;40:43;"This is about a world where the Beatles never existed."""
40:43;40:45;"Okay, Bruce."
40:45;40:48;"[laughter]"
40:48;40:52;"I mean, that's rich. You could have like Bruce Willis pitching ""Die Hard."""
40:52;40:54;"I mean, you could, you know..."
40:54;40:56;"Oh, yeah."
40:56;40:58;"Harrison Ford pitching ""The Fugitive."""
40:58;41:01;"Just whatever. I mean, it's endless."
41:01;41:06;"The only criterion is you have to be very famous and over 65."
41:06;41:08;"Yeah, old."
41:08;41:12;"So this is almost like a new series for the Gentle Jesters prank network"
41:12;41:14;"that we're kind of building out."
41:14;41:17;"If it really takes off, we could spin it off to be its own show."
41:17;41:19;"Its own channel. Like, own."
41:19;41:22;"[laughter]"
41:22;41:26;"We're definitely going to have Gigi TV one of these days."
41:26;41:28;"Is this going to circle back to Aaron Lewis?"
41:28;41:29;"Oh, yeah, of course."
41:29;41:34;"Aaron Lewis wakes up in a reality where ""It's Been Awhile"" was not a huge hit."
41:34;41:39;"Aaron Lewis wakes up and is the only person he remembers in the meantime."
41:39;41:41;"Well, it's not really my aesthetic."
41:41;41:45;"Aaron Lewis is like, ""I'm not into that '70s David Bowie crap."""
41:45;41:46;"[laughter]"
41:46;41:50;"Sorry, I can't stop thinking about just the most awkward ones possible."
41:50;41:52;"Like, um..."
41:52;41:55;"Okay, yeah, so it's time to get back to Aaron Lewis."
41:55;41:59;"Let's get back on ""track,"" quote unquote."
41:59;42:02;"So, Aaron Lewis."
42:02;42:07;"You probably know him from the amazing ""Stayin'"" song, ""It's Been Awhile."""
42:07;42:08;"And the truth is--"
42:08;42:09;"Can we hear that?"
42:09;42:13;"Yeah, let's start with that before we get to his Fourth of July song."
42:17;42:20;"So this is '96, '97?"
42:20;42:23;"I think later. What year is this?"
42:23;42:25;"This is off their first record, right?"
42:25;42:27;"Or maybe not. No, it's not. Later."
42:27;42:29;"2001."
42:29;42:30;"Oh."
42:30;42:32;"2001. Okay."
42:32;42:34;"Pre or post 9/11?"
42:34;42:36;"July of 2001."
42:36;42:38;"I'm just guessing."
42:38;42:40;"I need an actual date on this."
42:40;42:43;"March 27, 2001."
42:43;42:44;"Okay."
42:44;42:50;"While we listen, can I just pitch one more of this Sir Paul, Gentle Chester thing?"
42:50;42:57;"I just think there's a moment where some exec sort of has the gumption to be like,"
42:57;43:00;"""I'm so sorry, but this is a movie."""
43:00;43:03;"And he's just like, ""Bulls--t."""
43:03;43:06;"Paul McCartney's like, ""I just--what the f--k are you talking about?"""
43:06;43:08;"And he's like, ""No, no, come around to my side of the desk."""
43:08;43:12;"And he pulls up the trailer to ""Yesterday."""
43:12;43:13;"And they're sitting there watching."
43:13;43:18;"So it's Paul McCartney with this Warner Brothers executive watching the trailer."
43:18;43:23;"And just Paul McCartney gets so angry."
43:23;43:26;"Like, he's just like, ""I'm lawyer-ing."""
43:26;43:29;"""I never cleared this."""
43:29;43:31;"And the guy's like, ""Oh, my God, I was just trying to sort of help."""
43:31;43:34;"And he's like, ""I'm lawyer-ing up."""
43:34;43:36;"Like, just really pushes it."
43:36;43:38;"Gets a little, like, aggressive."
43:38;43:40;"Like, the way you've never seen Paul McCartney."
43:40;43:41;"I mean, it's all a bit."
43:41;43:42;"So ultimately, be gentle."
43:42;43:43;"The guy's like, ""No, no, no, it's sorry."""
43:43;43:45;"And he's like--he just starts getting, like, sweating."
43:45;43:47;"You know what I mean? He's just getting red face."
43:47;43:50;"He's doing a lot of Sir Paul on the acting front, but I think he's ready for it."
43:50;43:51;"I think he could do it."
43:51;43:53;"And then I think it's super funny when he comes out, you know."
43:53;43:55;"And he's just like, ""Oh, you've been gestured."""
43:55;43:57;"We actually never came up with our--"
43:57;43:59;"""You've been punked."" Have we?"
43:59;44:01;"Like, we don't have the thing."
44:01;44:02;"What's the expose?"
44:02;44:05;"""You've been gently gestured."""
44:05;44:07;"""You've been gently gestured."""
44:07;44:10;"That's, like, our producer tag."
44:10;44:12;"""You've been gently gestured."""
44:12;44:15;"Matt reminds us, I think, of the ""Whisper."""
44:15;44:17;"It's just, like, ""Gentle gestures."""
44:17;44:18;"""Gentle gestures."""
44:18;44:20;"I think you had a ""Whisper."""
44:20;44:21;"But I like it being, ""You've been--"""
44:21;44:22;"I like the action."
44:22;44:26;"""You've been gently gestured."""
44:26;44:28;"""You've been gently gestured."""
44:28;44:34;"♪ That I'm right here ♪"
44:34;44:39;"♪ I'm gonna lift things up again ♪"
44:39;44:45;"♪ Yeah ♪"
44:45;44:49;"I gotta say, this song sounds pretty good to me."
44:49;44:51;"It's more tasteful than I thought it would be."
44:51;44:53;"Yeah, it's funny how that works."
44:53;44:55;"I remember when it was a hit, I was just like--"
44:55;44:56;"Did you hate it?"
44:56;44:59;"I hated it so much back in '01."
44:59;45:02;"I was just like, ""God, I hate the direction that alt-rock radio's gone"
45:02;45:08;"with this, like, kind of just really heavy, super serious, like--"""
45:08;45:12;"I mean, I liked, you know, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains,"
45:12;45:14;"who were heavy and super serious, but--"
45:14;45:16;"Yeah, they're the predecessors for this."
45:16;45:17;"Yeah."
45:17;45:20;"They were, like, protégés of Limp Bizkit?"
45:20;45:21;"Is that, like--"
45:21;45:24;"Well, we'll get into that, because, yeah, like,"
45:24;45:28;"when Ezra sent the Fourth of July song to The Thread a few weeks ago,"
45:28;45:32;"it really opened a whole discussion up on Stained and Aaron--"
45:32;45:34;"What's his name? Aaron Lewis?"
45:34;45:35;"Aaron Lewis."
45:35;45:39;"And, yeah, did some serious Wikipedia stuff,"
45:39;45:44;"but, like, I remember in that article, it was fascinating that"
45:44;45:48;"they toured with Limp Bizkit, and Fred Durst was apparently"
45:48;45:51;"very disturbed by their first album cover."
45:51;45:52;"Because it was satanic?"
45:52;45:55;"Yeah, just in that way that, like, heavy bands, like,"
45:55;45:57;"in the '80s and '90s would just be, like--"
45:57;46:00;"I don't know, just, like, have, like, a bloody doll,"
46:00;46:02;"or, like, a bunch of crosses, or--"
46:02;46:05;"Just, like, you know, kind of, like, quote-unquote"
46:05;46:08;"""dark"" subject matter in this really cartoonish way."
46:08;46:11;"And Durst seemed to, like, take it super seriously."
46:11;46:14;"I don't know if Durst was, like, Christian, or what the story was."
46:14;46:18;"Limp Bizkit was heavy, but they weren't really devilish."
46:18;46:19;"Right, but I mean--"
46:19;46:20;"Was that, like, a car horn honking?"
46:20;46:21;"Yeah, that's me, sorry."
46:21;46:25;"I mean, it's not my car, but there's an alarm going off."
46:25;46:27;"Oh, damn."
46:27;46:28;"It's all good."
46:28;46:30;"Leave it in."
46:30;46:34;"So, Fred Durst thought that Stained was maybe a little bit devilish."
46:34;46:36;"I find that, like, so hard to believe."
46:36;46:39;"Like, you would think a guy like Fred Durst, like,"
46:39;46:42;"knows that none of those bands are actually devilish."
46:42;46:43;"It's very strange."
46:43;46:45;"I mean, well, hold on."
46:45;46:48;"This is becoming a straight-up Stained episode."
46:48;46:50;"This is a Yesterday meets Stained episode."
46:50;46:54;"So, let's talk about the actual origins of Stained and Aaron Lewis"
46:54;46:59;"as we build up to the big reveal of Aaron Lewis's Fourth of July song."
46:59;47:02;"Born in Springfield, Vermont, in '72."
47:02;47:04;"That's a real Gen Xer."
47:04;47:07;"That's the heart of Gen X, really."
47:07;47:09;"His parents apparently were, like, hippies"
47:09;47:12;"who were living in a log cabin in Vermont."
47:12;47:14;"So, picture that."
47:14;47:17;"Oh, actually, this kind of reminds me in a weird way."
47:17;47:18;"I'd sent to the thread earlier today"
47:18;47:21;"that I discovered that Tucker Carlson was born"
47:21;47:24;"in the Mission District of San Francisco in 1969."
47:24;47:29;"Again, just a weird, like, not what you expect."
47:29;47:33;"Like, he kind of went the opposite direction of the ethos"
47:33;47:35;"of the time and place he was born."
47:35;47:37;"Tucker Carlson literally was a baby"
47:37;47:39;"like a few doors down from the Grateful Dead,"
47:39;47:41;"who he became a big fan of."
47:41;47:42;"Yeah, he is a deadhead."
47:42;47:45;"But, like, you know, on this show,"
47:45;47:47;"we're obsessed with 1969 California."
47:47;47:51;"The gap opened, also in San Francisco."
47:51;47:53;"That's true."
47:53;47:54;"That's funny, actually."
47:54;47:56;"Whoa, that's also pretty deep."
47:56;47:57;"Oh, God."
47:57;47:58;"I mean, at this point in the show's history,"
47:58;48:01;"we just have so many, like, rich veins we can go down."
48:01;48:05;"'Cause, like, I can imagine us doing, like, a solid 45"
48:05;48:09;"on the CIA, like, dosing baby Tucker Carlson"
48:09;48:13;"in 1969 San Francisco as part of the MKUltra experiments"
48:13;48:17;"to create a right-wing news anchor."
48:17;48:19;"But anyway, we won't go down that route."
48:19;48:20;"Save that for another show."
48:20;48:21;"Yeah, save that for another show."
48:21;48:24;"So Aaron Lewis, I don't know how he politically identifies,"
48:24;48:27;"but, you know, his music and his solo career"
48:27;48:30;"kind of leans conservative."
48:30;48:31;"Maybe you could say right-wing."
48:31;48:33;"So it's interesting that he was born in Vermont"
48:33;48:35;"to hippie parents."
48:35;48:38;"Right. I would say since the Trump era has started,"
48:38;48:39;"he's full Trump train."
48:39;48:40;"He wears a MAGA hat."
48:40;48:41;"Oh, he wears a MAGA hat, okay."
48:41;48:44;"I don't know what his deal was, like, you know, 15 years."
48:44;48:46;"I'm looking at a photo of him"
48:46;48:48;"where he's wearing an impeach Biden hat."
48:48;48:49;"Okay."
48:49;48:51;"In 2020, Lewis said of his political views,"
48:51;48:55;"""I'm sure that some stained fans don't feel the same way as I do."
48:55;48:58;"The way I look at it is if I offend you with my point of view,"
48:58;48:59;"then good."
48:59;49:02;"You need something to snap you out of your slumber."""
49:02;49:03;"Slumber."
49:03;49:05;"Kind of poetic word there."
49:05;49:07;"Yeah, kind of a delicate word."
49:07;49:10;"Listen, man, you're in, like, a gentle slumber of deception."
49:10;49:12;"Wake up, mother[bleep]!"
49:12;49:14;"You're slumbering!"
49:14;49:15;"[laughs]"
49:15;49:18;"You're [bleep] brainwashed by the liberal media, man!"
49:18;49:20;"You're in a deep slumber."
49:20;49:22;"[laughs]"
49:22;49:24;"Well, he's a wordsmith."
49:24;49:26;"He's a poet. He can't help it."
49:26;49:28;"And my point that I'll be making on today's show"
49:28;49:30;"is that he is a good songwriter."
49:30;49:33;"So his parents were hippies, born in Vermont."
49:33;49:35;"Obviously, he's been on quite a journey"
49:35;49:37;"in his 49 years on Earth."
49:37;49:40;"Yeah, so he was raised in Springfield, Massachusetts,"
49:40;49:42;"which is, like, southern Massachusetts"
49:42;49:44;"near the Connecticut border."
49:44;49:47;"That's where the Basketball Hall of Fame is."
49:47;49:51;"And the band started in Springfield, Massachusetts,"
49:51;49:54;"which is a weird place for a band to start."
49:54;49:56;"Like, he met, like, all the guys from Stained"
49:56;49:57;"or from Springfield."
49:57;49:58;"What, is that alarm going off?"
49:58;49:59;"This car alarm is."
49:59;50:01;"[laughs]"
50:01;50:03;"Pre-recorded internet radio, folks."
50:03;50:05;"You know how it is."
50:05;50:06;"[laughs]"
50:06;50:08;"There's only so much we can do."
50:08;50:10;"So Stained started out covering"
50:10;50:12;"Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Tool,"
50:12;50:14;"and Alice in Chains."
50:14;50:16;"Sounds about right."
50:16;50:19;"And then started putting out records."
50:19;50:22;"Fred Durst co-produced their first album."
50:22;50:24;"They toured with Limp Bizkit."
50:24;50:26;"And then It's Been Awhile"
50:26;50:28;"propelled them to the top of the charts."
50:28;50:30;"The album that It's Been Awhile is on,"
50:30;50:31;"which is their third album,"
50:31;50:33;"debuted at number one on Billboard's"
50:33;50:36;"Top 200 Album Chart, selling 716,000 copies"
50:36;50:38;"in its first week,"
50:38;50:40;"which is insane by modern standards."
50:40;50:41;"Wow."
50:41;50:43;"So they were a big fat band."
50:43;50:45;"Did their thing for a while."
50:45;50:47;"Lineup changes."
50:47;50:49;"And then around 2014,"
50:49;50:50;"they went on hiatus,"
50:50;50:53;"and Aaron Lewis wanted to play solo shows."
50:53;50:55;"And then he basically became,"
50:55;50:58;"I guess, like a country singer."
50:58;51:00;"It actually makes a lot of sense."
51:00;51:03;"It's not like he fully abandoned"
51:03;51:06;"the vibe of Stained."
51:06;51:08;"In his solo career,"
51:08;51:10;"it's country, but it's kind of dark,"
51:10;51:12;"and he sounds like himself."
51:12;51:14;"So, I don't know."
51:14;51:16;"He said in a 2011 interview that he was"
51:16;51:17;"introduced to country music as a child"
51:17;51:18;"by his grandfather,"
51:18;51:20;"but his interest was rekindled"
51:20;51:22;"when he toured with Kid Rock."
51:22;51:23;"Oh yeah, hell yeah."
51:23;51:24;"Just like Kid Rock,"
51:24;51:25;"who made an interesting transition"
51:25;51:28;"from kind of hard rock to country,"
51:28;51:30;"Aaron Lewis kind of following in his footsteps."
51:30;51:32;"And I think he's been fairly successful."
51:32;51:34;"I mean, both those guys are,"
51:34;51:36;"it's the transition from hard rock to country,"
51:36;51:37;"but it's really,"
51:37;51:39;"they're basically doing the same thing"
51:39;51:41;"with just a little country window dressing."
51:41;51:44;"And I guess as America became more polarized,"
51:44;51:45;"they had to,"
51:45;51:46;"and I mean,"
51:46;51:47;"I've said some version of this before,"
51:47;51:50;"that there was something about alternative rock"
51:50;51:53;"used to be this kind of consensus music,"
51:53;51:56;"at least for a certain type of white dude."
51:56;51:58;"There was like this middle ground"
51:58;52:00;"where the different polarities could meet."
52:00;52:02;"Yeah, Pearl Jam and the Chili Peppers rule."
52:02;52:03;"Yeah, or like,"
52:03;52:05;"you love Soundgarden?"
52:05;52:06;"Hey man,"
52:06;52:08;"I don't know if you're from"
52:08;52:10;"Alabama, California, Connecticut."
52:10;52:12;"I don't know if you voted for Bill Clinton"
52:12;52:14;"or George H.W. Bush,"
52:14;52:15;"but you're all right with me, man,"
52:15;52:17;"because you got good taste in hard rock."
52:17;52:19;"That's what it was like back then."
52:19;52:20;"Totally."
52:20;52:23;"There was these kind of consensus bands."
52:23;52:26;"But then as America became more polarized,"
52:26;52:28;"enter the Trump era,"
52:28;52:31;"there's no consensus kind of music like that."
52:31;52:32;"So if you're a right winger,"
52:32;52:35;"you probably gravitate a little more towards country"
52:35;52:37;"because obviously there's country"
52:37;52:39;"of all political persuasions,"
52:39;52:41;"but there's something about that move"
52:41;52:42;"where you are kind of like saying,"
52:42;52:43;"I'm definitely,"
52:43;52:44;"I'm on this side."
52:44;52:45;"Yeah, American flags,"
52:45;52:46;"pickup trucks."
52:46;52:49;"Yeah, if you're going for that type of country."
52:49;52:51;"I'm sure some people do,"
52:51;52:54;"they'll make like an alt country kind of liberal"
52:54;52:55;"Willie Nelson,"
52:55;52:56;"smoke weed kind of album,"
52:56;52:58;"but yeah, this is a different thing."
52:58;53:01;"And maybe it's also just has to do with like"
53:01;53:03;"watching the bottom fall out."
53:03;53:05;"Hearing that rock was played out, dog."
53:05;53:07;"He heard it loud and clear."
53:07;53:08;"Stand I'm sure was doing fine,"
53:08;53:10;"but maybe he realized, man,"
53:10;53:14;"we sold 716,000 albums in a week once."
53:14;53:16;"I want to try something different."
53:16;53:17;"I did my thing with rock music."
53:17;53:18;"Let's try something different."
53:18;53:20;"We can go through some of his solo career,"
53:20;53:23;"but we might as well start with his 4th of July song now"
53:23;53:26;"called am I the only one?"
53:26;53:29;"So I assume that this song is probably not getting like a ton"
53:29;53:32;"of support at the streaming services,"
53:32;53:36;"but it was briefly number one on the iTunes music store."
53:36;53:38;"So clearly it's resonating with some group of people."
53:38;53:43;"And I listened to it and just a warning to our listeners."
53:43;53:46;"He's a, this is a conservative country song,"
53:46;53:48;"but it's interesting to listen to it."
53:48;53:49;"I think you get a win."
53:49;53:52;"We certainly get a window into how Aaron Lewis is feeling about the state of"
53:52;53:55;"the nation and probably what quite a few other people are feeling given the"
53:55;53:57;"relative success of the song."
53:57;53:58;"And I was,"
53:58;54:01;"even though I don't agree with the political message of the song,"
54:01;54:06;"I was struck by the fact that he is a very competent songwriter,"
54:06;54:09;"but let's listen to it also just to give people a sense of what his music"
54:09;54:16;"sounds like now."
54:16;54:20;"And of course him dropping this right around the 4th of July was kind of"
54:20;54:29;"like a call to arms."
54:29;54:34;"Am I the only one here tonight?"
54:34;54:38;"Shaking my head and thinking something ain't right."
54:38;54:40;"Is it just me?"
54:40;54:42;"Am I losing my mind?"
54:42;54:46;"Am I standing on the edge of the end of time?"
54:46;54:49;"Am I the only one?"
54:49;54:51;"Tell me I'm not."
54:51;54:57;"Who thinks of taking all the good we got and turning it back?"
54:57;54:59;"Hell, I'll be damned."
54:59;55:03;"I think I'm turning into my old man."
55:03;55:04;"But your old man was a hippie."
55:04;55:05;"Big question."
55:05;55:11;"Am I the only one willing to bleed?"
55:11;55:15;"Or take a bullet for being free?"
55:15;55:20;"Screaming what the fuck in my TV for telling me,"
55:20;55:26;"yeah, you're telling me that I'm the only one willing to fight."
55:26;55:28;"He's got an ear for melody."
55:28;55:29;"He really does."
55:29;55:33;"I heard the song once and I remember almost the entire thing."
55:33;55:40;"Burning on the ground, another statue coming down in a town near you."
55:40;55:45;"Watching the threads of old glory come undone."
55:45;55:47;"Wait, pause it for a sec."
55:47;55:50;"So the first two verses are pretty good."
55:50;55:52;"Am I the only one here tonight?"
55:52;55:54;"Shaking my head, thinking something's not right."
55:54;55:57;"And then he's talking about standing on the edge of the end of time."
55:57;55:59;"That's something everyone can relate to, you know?"
55:59;56:02;"That first verse could be a Mountain Bruce song."
56:02;56:04;"Oh, absolutely."
56:04;56:07;"Yeah, just sort of like end of history kind of vibes of like,"
56:07;56:09;"where are we headed?"
56:09;56:13;"Right, that's a general feeling a lot of people have."
56:13;56:14;"Yeah."
56:14;56:15;"Something's not right."
56:15;56:17;"And then the next verse is great too."
56:17;56:18;"Am I the only one?"
56:18;56:19;"And it's turning bad."
56:19;56:20;"Hell, I'll be damned."
56:20;56:22;"I think I'm turning into mild man."
56:22;56:24;"Again, totally universal."
56:24;56:27;"Like, as you get older, maybe you get a little crankier."
56:27;56:30;"Maybe you look at what's happening with younger people"
56:30;56:31;"with greater skepticism."
56:31;56:32;"It's classic."
56:32;56:33;"Yeah."
56:33;56:34;"You turn into your parents."
56:34;56:37;"Things annoy you that you never dreamed would annoy you."
56:37;56:39;"It doesn't have to be political."
56:39;56:42;"Just like, ""God, why are the neighbors making so much noise?"""
56:42;56:43;"Whatever."
56:43;56:45;"You know, ""Why is that car alarm going off?"""
56:45;56:47;"And then he gets to the chorus."
56:47;56:48;"It turns on the chorus."
56:48;56:49;"That's when you understand."
56:49;56:50;"It's rough."
56:50;56:54;"Am I the only one willing to bleed or take a bullet for being free?"
56:54;56:55;"It's like, dude."
56:55;56:57;"Well, it's also sort of zero to a hundred."
56:57;56:58;"What?"
56:58;57:01;"I'm just like, ""Man, I thought we were just talking about the end of history, man."""
57:01;57:02;"And getting old."
57:02;57:05;"I just thought we were talking about aging and weird vibes."
57:05;57:07;"Like, now you're willing to take a bullet?"
57:07;57:11;"And also, dude, you're not serving in the military."
57:11;57:13;"What are you talking about?"
57:13;57:16;"Dude, I love the screaming, ""What the f***?"" at my TV."
57:16;57:18;"It totally reminds me of that Will Ferrell bit."
57:18;57:21;"There's a movie where he's singing in a wedding band."
57:21;57:24;"And he's like, ""I really need you tonight."""
57:24;57:25;"That's not Will Ferrell."
57:25;57:26;"""I really f***ing need you."""
57:26;57:27;"Wait, who is that?"
57:27;57:31;"That's the Dan band in Wedding Crashers."
57:31;57:32;"Okay, yeah."
57:32;57:33;"Or no, no, in Old School."
57:33;57:34;"What are those movies?"
57:34;57:41;"No, it's in a Will Ferrell movie, and it's the band where the wedding singer just adds ""f***"" into the songs."
57:41;57:43;"""I f***ing need you tonight."""
57:43;57:45;"[laughter]"
57:45;57:48;"The way he crams that ""f***"" into this chorus is like..."
57:48;57:50;"Well, also, one thing I'll say."
57:50;57:56;"I'm praising him as a songwriter because I do think he's a talented songwriter with an ear for melody and a way with words."
57:56;58:00;"And I'm willing to believe he has other songs that go a little bit deeper."
58:00;58:06;"But it's like, this is just totally polarized America where you don't have to..."
58:06;58:10;"I'd be interested to hear a song where he really lays it out, what his problem is."
58:10;58:12;"Like more specifically, you mean?"
58:12;58:14;"Yeah, because sometimes the world seems so polarized."
58:14;58:17;"Somebody might say, ""Well, I think this aspect..."""
58:17;58:18;"You know, you never know."
58:18;58:19;"Right-wingers, left-wingers."
58:19;58:23;"Somebody could say, ""No, I don't like this whole surveillance state thing that we don't have any privacy."""
58:23;58:27;"A left-winger might say, ""You know what, Aaron? I agree with you, man. We're not so different."""
58:27;58:31;"So it'd be one thing if he went through all of his specific issues with modern culture."
58:31;58:37;"But when you write a song that basically is just like, ""Am I the only one who thinks s*** is f***ed up? Am I right?"""
58:37;58:43;"You're basically just saying, ""If you're on Team MAGA, I'm just here to tell you I agree with you."""
58:43;58:46;"You're not getting into it, what actually unites them."
58:46;58:47;"Yeah."
58:47;58:50;"The ideology, you're just like, ""Something's f***ed up and we all agree with it."""
58:50;58:52;"And it's like, ""All right, so what is it?"""
58:52;58:54;"You're going to take a bullet for some vague thing?"
58:54;58:56;"Who's shooting the bullet?"
58:56;58:57;"Yeah."
58:57;59:02;"But again, he knows that you get people fired up with that kind of language."
59:02;59:06;"And again, it is a smart conceit, I guess, for a song."
59:06;59:09;"When you say some s*** like, ""Am I the only one?"""
59:09;59:11;"Because I watched the lyric video on YouTube."
59:11;59:14;"So you can imagine that because the song's called ""Am I the only one?"""
59:14;59:17;"And that's the question that he asked throughout, ""Am I the only one?"""
59:17;59:20;"You can imagine what all the YouTube comments were."
59:20;59:23;"""Absolutely not, Aaron. You are far from the only one."
59:23;59:24;"I'm with you here, brother."""
59:24;59:26;"""You're not alone, brother."""
59:26;59:28;"""You're definitely not the only one."""
59:28;59:32;"See, to me, I immediately applied that TC logic to the song."
59:32;59:33;"And I was sort of like..."
59:33;59:35;"That rigorous TC logic?"
59:35;59:38;"Why are you asking this question, even rhetorically?"
59:38;59:40;"Obviously, you're not the only one."
59:40;59:44;"You're representing a viewpoint that half the country feels, more or less."
59:44;59:46;"Do you not follow politics?"
59:46;59:48;"Do you watch Fox News?"
59:48;59:50;"Let's get into the next verse."
59:50;59:51;"Yeah, yeah."
59:51;59:53;"Am I the only one?"
59:53;59:56;"Not brainwashed?"
59:56;01:00:00;"Making my way through the land of the lost?"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"Who sees it as it is?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"And worries about his kids"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"As they try to undo"
01:00:06;01:00:11;"It's almost like Mr. Show, David Cross or something."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"Yeah."
01:00:12;01:00:17;"I do appreciate him just dropping a f*** into s***."
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Wait, he just did another one."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"Wait, back it up."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"You're the only one"
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Who can't take no more"
01:00:26;01:00:31;"Screaming, ""If you don't like it, there's a f***ing door."""
01:00:31;01:00:34;"This ain't the freedom we've been fighting for"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Here with something more"
01:00:36;01:00:39;"Here with something more"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"He really has an ear for melody."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"""Is that the freedom we..."
01:00:43;01:00:47;"This ain't the freedom we were fighting for"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"Here with something more."""
01:00:49;01:00:50;"He keeps climbing."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"It's quite memorable."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"He keeps climbing and this song really does have peaks and valleys."
01:00:55;01:00:59;"Again, I imagine most of our listeners do not agree with the political message, but the..."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Ezra respects the craft."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I respect the craft."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"And when he hits the..."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"And also, I do think this is some interesting s*** to know what's going on."
01:01:06;01:01:09;"This is what the dude from ""Stained"" is up to now."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"We're learning something."
01:01:11;01:01:13;"But yeah, even when he hits the..."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"""If you don't like it, here's the f***ing door."""
01:01:15;01:01:16;"It might make you laugh."
01:01:16;01:01:18;"It might make you cry."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"But either way, it pops out."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"You know, the song has like contours."
01:01:22;01:01:27;"Maybe one day I'll run into Aaron Lewis somewhere in rural Massachusetts"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"and we could chop it up a little bit."
01:01:29;01:01:33;"I'd love to pick his brand, but I'm sure he's got plenty to say."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"But again..."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"I was picturing you guys sitting at the same Grammy's table."
01:01:36;01:01:37;"[laughter]"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"Remember?"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"Didn't you sit at a table with the Florida Georgia like that?"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"Yeah, with Florida Georgia line."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"Not that much of a stretch."
01:01:44;01:01:46;"Yeah, I didn't get to talk to those guys."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"Those guys are gentle jesters for sure."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"Well, actually, I heard something about them recently."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Who was I talking to?"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Man, who the f*** was I talking to?"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"I can't remember."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"[laughter]"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"Just going to start driving like really aggressive..."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"[laughter]"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"...f***s throughout this show."
01:02:02;01:02:03;"F-bombs."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I was talking to somebody and I said,"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"""Oh, what's up with Florida Georgia line?"""
01:02:07;01:02:09;"I've always liked those guys."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I like their manager who I got to talk to."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"And maybe I'm speaking out of turn."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"I hope this wasn't a country music insider who told me this"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"and I wasn't supposed to say anything."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"Although I don't really know any country music insiders,"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"so I imagine it's just a random person just probably reading Us Weekly."
01:02:24;01:02:27;"But they said that they heard that Florida and Georgia"
01:02:27;01:02:31;"were going through a tense period because of politics."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Oh, wow."
01:02:33;01:02:34;"I don't know."
01:02:34;01:02:37;"Maybe Georgia went blue like the state did,"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"maybe Florida went red and they're just having a tough time with that."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"Although I would say, you know what fellas?"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Just lean into it."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"You could gently jest with each other on stage."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"Yeah, that sounds rich."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"Maybe each of you goes to a different side of the stage"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"and is just like, ""If you love the Democratic Party,"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"make some f***ing noise."""
01:02:54;01:02:57;"And then Farr is like, ""All right, all right, all right."""
01:02:57;01:03:00;"[laughter]"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"""Now my Republicans, can we beat that?"""
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Kind of McConaughey."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Like total vaudeville."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"George is just like shaking his head, ""No, no, no."""
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Florida comes out like, ""Now if you really love the Republicans,"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"make some noise!"""
01:03:15;01:03:17;"And then Georgia's--you know, they get a response."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"Anyway, I hope they work it out."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"Well, they've come out with a song called ""Undivided."""
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Okay, so maybe this was just out there."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"This was out there in the culture."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"Let's hit that next."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Yeah, and this is pretty recent."
01:03:28;01:03:32;"They definitely are politically different,"
01:03:32;01:03:36;"but they've said that they will not let it get between them."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"All right, let's keep going with this, Aaron Lewis."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"I just wanted to say one line that jumped out to me."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"And this is where I would appreciate--"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"maybe next Fourth of July he'll drop a song"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"that gets a little more into his deep political philosophy."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"But when you say some s*** like,"
01:03:50;01:03:53;"""If you don't like it, there's the f***ing door."""
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Which he did deliver really well."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"But when you say, ""If you don't like it, there's the f***ing door,"""
01:03:58;01:04:00;"it's also like, ""Well, come on, Aaron."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"You're the one who doesn't like it."""
01:04:02;01:04:04;"You know what I mean, man?"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"I'm with you."
01:04:05;01:04:10;"If somebody wanted to say, ""I only want to live in a country with chill people,"""
01:04:10;01:04:12;"I understand that sensibility."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"I would love to be in a world with more chill people,"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"people who appreciate kind vibes,"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"people who have a chill worldview."
01:04:19;01:04:23;"I don't think that corresponds to any end of the political spectrum."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"But again, you're the one who's very fired up and angry."
01:04:26;01:04:29;"So that gets into this weird philosophical question."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"What is America?"
01:04:32;01:04:35;"So the people who you think don't like America,"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"well, you also don't like America."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"What are we talking about?"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Maybe move to Canada, Aaron."
01:04:41;01:04:43;"You were born pretty close to there, sir."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"Up in Vermont."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"You know?"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Okay, let's get-- What else?"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Oh, we got some really good s*** left in this song, actually."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Yeah, yeah. Let's keep going."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"Who cares about the statues?"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"I know. He doesn't care about the statues."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"He doesn't care about the statues."
01:05:14;01:05:18;"Name ten Confederate generals."
01:05:18;01:05:24;"This also struck me as so weird for someone that's not even from the South."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Right."
01:05:25;01:05:30;"Although he has a song called ""Northern Redneck."""
01:05:30;01:05:32;"This is the bridge that made me give it up and say,"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"""This man is a talented songwriter."""
01:05:44;01:05:48;"Which begs the question, was he ever a Springsteen fan?"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"Oh, yes. We got to pause that."
01:05:50;01:05:54;"First of all, I was kind of half watching the lyric video that"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"you can imagine that when we got to that bridge,"
01:05:56;01:05:59;"that's when I was sending to the TC thread,"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"""Everybody needs to hear this."""
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Because everything about it is, first of all,"
01:06:03;01:06:06;"this very gentle Beatles-esque bridge."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Yeah, with the cellos."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"The ascending strings."
01:06:10;01:06:15;"And again, a real panache for peaks and valleys in a song."
01:06:15;01:06:19;"He knew that this was a true shots fired thing."
01:06:19;01:06:23;"Where he goes, ""I'm the only one who quit singing along"
01:06:23;01:06:27;"every time I hear a Springsteen song."""
01:06:27;01:06:31;"Gets so quiet. Music totally vanishes."
01:06:31;01:06:33;"Really, he wants you to sit with that."
01:06:33;01:06:37;"I mean, I wonder if he's going to become president or something one day."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"That just came to mind."
01:06:39;01:06:44;"In the same way that Trump just had the gift of public speaking,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"he knew to get real quiet there."
01:06:46;01:06:50;"Maybe that does resonate with a certain type of right winger"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"who loved Springsteen in the 80s and really is disheartened"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"that he's just full Democratic operative."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Although it's hilarious, though,"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"because Springsteen's politics really haven't changed."
01:07:01;01:07:05;"Right. Springsteen was never right wing."
01:07:05;01:07:07;"I mean, yeah, it'd be one thing to be like,"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"""Oh man, I wish Bruce got out there for Bernie."""
01:07:10;01:07:14;"But obviously that's not where Aaron Lewis is coming from."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Yeah, did Aaron Lewis love Springsteen?"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"I mean, I know a lot of country people love Springsteen"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"because he's a great writer."
01:07:20;01:07:24;"Springsteen had worked within the country idiom"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"on many an occasion as well."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"He's definitely got a deep love of the genre."
01:07:28;01:07:32;"My guess, he was not, just based on the stained aesthetic,"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"he was not a Springsteen fan ever."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"I could be totally wrong, but that's just a hunch."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"I think he was into heavier music."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Well, that also begs the question,"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"to what extent is he kind of playing a character here?"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"He just knows what's a good line."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"He knew that, ""Hell, I'll be damned."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"I think I'm turning into my old man."""
01:07:51;01:07:54;"Meanwhile, his old man is a full gentle jester,"
01:07:54;01:07:58;"bald dude with a gray ponytail pulled around the sides,"
01:07:58;01:08:04;"tie-dyed hair, and Birkenstocks saw the dead 70 times."

01:08:07;01:08:11;"He's like, ""You know, Aaron, man, I really--"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"I feel that you've kind of portrayed me"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"in kind of a strange way."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"You seem really fired up about some weird stuff."
01:08:18;01:08:21;"We need to see each other in person sometime, man."""
01:08:21;01:08:23;"[laughter]"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"I think he's taking a little poetic license here"

01:08:38;01:08:40;"notably leaving out his dad, right?"

01:08:46;01:08:52;"And so it just doesn't sound as, you know, poetic to say,"

01:08:55;01:08:58;"[laughter]"
01:08:58;01:09:02;"""Goddamn, I think I'm turning into my uncle."""
01:09:02;01:09:04;"""My uncle, man."""
01:09:04;01:09:07;"That's a better line, but that's--wow."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"[laughter]"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"And then on the Springsteen side, I think that obviously"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"he's speaking solely about ""Born in the USA,"" right?"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"Which I think has been the--I don't know what we're talking about here,"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"but it is like there's a whole--you know, obviously,"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"there's a whole group that just never understood--you know,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"that's been the thing is you never listen to the lyrics,"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"but you're just singing along to ""Born in the USA."""
01:09:26;01:09:29;"But I think he's just referencing Bruce Springsteen"
01:09:29;01:09:34;"playing every Democratic event for the last, like, 30 years"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"and, like, really wearing that on his sleeve."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"And so it doesn't really--you know, it could be any"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Bruce Springsteen song. It could be, you know--"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"But if you were singing along. I'm saying if you're being like,"

01:24:49;01:24:51;"who actually don't care about politics at all."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"- I'm sure there's many people who are like-- - Oh, of course."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"""Yeah, I'm into pickup trucks, hunting,"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"""white tail, whatever."" And they're just like,"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"""So you must love Trump."" And they'll just be like,"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"""Ah, man, no."" Like, I don't--"
01:25:01;01:25:04;"Who knows? That person presumably exists somewhere."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"But yeah, the question is,"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"even if you're wearing Carhartt and driving a pickup truck,"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"that also could probably be a handful of"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"hipsters in New York and L.A. and San Francisco."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I could totally picture a dude,"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"head-to-toe Carhartt, ripping around"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"Williamsburg with a pickup truck."
01:25:21;01:25:24;"- Just rolling into Fox. - Although the hipster would have"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"an '80s or '90s small pickup truck."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"They're not gonna be driving an F-250."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"(laughing)"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"Fresh off the lot."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"Like an $80,000 pickup."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"It is a good question. Were there any country artists"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"who heard Northern Redneck and they were just like,"
01:25:39;01:25:42;"""Yeah, this is cultural appropriation, dude."""
01:25:42;01:25:45;"'Cause wouldn't Northern Redneck be mayor of Easttown?"
01:25:45;01:25:48;"It's the Western Mass accent."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"It's actually its own-- it's not Southern."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Or maybe that's just the weird Borghesean element."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"Country music is sung in a Southern accent,"
01:25:57;01:26:00;"so even a Northern country song"
01:26:00;01:26:03;"that's about how Southern people"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"don't have a unique claim"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"to rural conservative identity"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"has to be sung in a Southern accent."
01:26:09;01:26:11;"- It's a strange rule. - Yeah, I mean, even if--"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"Even if the Rolling Stones are doing a country song,"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"Mick will do a weird Southern accent."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Like, yeah, on ""Faraway Eyes."""
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Although-- but then you get to this thing."
01:26:21;01:26:25;"I mean, I thought about it with some VW country-leaning songs."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"I was very-- really trying not to go too country"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"'cause it is-- you know, your voice wants to go there."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"But I mean, when I think about, like, really, you know,"
01:26:33;01:26:35;"like Jerry, for instance,"
01:26:35;01:26:37;"he would do the Dead's country material"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"kind of in his same iconic, unique,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Northern California Jerry voice."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Yeah, that's true."
01:26:44;01:26:48;"Speaking of Aaron Lewis's number one enemy, Bruce Springsteen,"
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Bruce has always had an interesting thing"
01:26:50;01:26:53;"where he's, like-- he does have this, like,"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"all-American accent voice."
01:26:55;01:26:59;"His singing voice has, like, a hint of, like, Southern-ness in it."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"This all-American thing."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"I mean, he's a fascinating dude, too,"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"in terms of, like, place"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"that he obviously so identified with New Jersey,"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"but then, like, he did--"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"he could just make an album called ""Nebraska"""
01:27:12;01:27:17;"and, you know, sing songs about other parts of the country"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"and just, like, went down really easy"
01:27:19;01:27:22;"where New Jersey is definitely--"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"is so hyper-specific"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"that's such an East Coast state."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"It's got such a unique reputation and vibe."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"It's not considered, like, an all-American place,"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"and yet he-- from New Jersey,"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"he became an all-American dude."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"What's funny is that he probably sings about New Jersey"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"less than a lot of other places,"
01:27:40;01:27:43;"less than, like, the mythical Heartland,"
01:27:43;01:27:46;"whether it's the Nebraska stuff"
01:27:46;01:27:49;"or whether it's the ""Ghost of Tom Jode"" stuff,"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"which is all, like, songs in, like, Fresno and stuff."
01:27:52;01:27:55;"Like, you know, like where ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was set."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"But, like, I can't think of that many, like,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"specific New Jersey songs."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I mean, maybe some of the stuff on ""Born to Run,"""
01:28:01;01:28:04;"like, he's going across the river to do a favor for a guy."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Or I guess there's ""Atlantic City."" Duh."
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Again, that's the exact type of conversation"
01:28:08;01:28:10;"you could picture him and John Lando having."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Like, let's call this album ""Nebraska."""
01:28:12;01:28:15;"They're referencing, um,"
01:28:15;01:28:17;"like, the movie ""Badlands,"""
01:28:17;01:28:19;"which takes place in the Midwest,"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"which is based on the real people."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"And you can imagine them being like,"
01:28:23;01:28:25;"""Yeah, but you know what, man?"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"We're gonna have this song 'Atlantic City,'"""
01:28:27;01:28:29;"which is, like, the closer-to-home version."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"He's like, ""Ooh, I like this. The album's called 'Nebraska,'"""
01:28:31;01:28:33;"but then you got this song that takes place, like,"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"down the Jersey Shore."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I like how this all comes together"
01:28:37;01:28:39;"in this kind of, like, dark album about America."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"Yeah, it's funny."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I think I talked on the show a few years ago"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"about how much I love the--"
01:28:45;01:28:49;"Bruce live playing the Tom Waits song ""Jersey Girl,"""
01:28:49;01:28:51;"which a lot of people assume Bruce wrote"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"because it's about, you know,"
01:28:53;01:28:55;"hanging out with the Jersey Girl."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"But no, Tom Waits wrote it, and Bruce drops that in concert,"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"and of course people go nuts,"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"but he didn't write that song."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I just had this thought-- I've said this on the show before--"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"about how I'm always so bemused"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"by the fact that ""Scarlet Begonias"""
01:29:07;01:29:09;"is, as far as I know,"
01:29:09;01:29:13;"the only ""Grateful Dead"" song set in Europe."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"It's in the UK."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"""Grateful Dead,"" very all-American band,"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"one song that takes place in England."

01:29:21;01:29:25;"that take place, like, outside of North America?"""
01:29:25;01:29:27;"I feel like he has some, like,"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"late-period, like, Mexico songs"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"that are about, like, drug cartels and stuff."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"But, like--"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Yeah, on ""Ghost of Tom Joad,"""
01:29:35;01:29:37;"there's drug cartel songs."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"But, yeah, that's North America."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"Could you picture, like,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"a Bruce Springsteen song in, like, France?"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"On, like, the plains of Siberia?"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"[laughs]"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"I don't know. That's a hell of a number crunch."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"""In a crowded marketplace in old Mumbai."""
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Like-- [laughs]"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"You could apply that to--"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"You could almost apply that to anything."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"""In old Mumbai."""

01:30:05;01:30:07;"[laughs]"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"""In old Mumbai town."""
01:30:09;01:30:11;"Well, I guess I could picture, like,"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"a Bruce song about, like, a soldier"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"in Afghanistan, maybe."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Yeah. I think Seinfeld dropped off the call."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"Can anybody just real quick do--"
01:30:19;01:30:21;"I don't know if this would turn up anything."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Bruce Springsteen songs"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"set outside North America?"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"[laughs]"
01:30:27;01:30:29;"That's not gonna be an autofilm."
01:30:29;01:30:31;"I already did. It's too hard to find"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"because you just get European tours."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"You know, you just get tour stuff."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Right, right, right."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"I've been trying to find-- Yeah, I do think that--"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"Well, if the listeners know."
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Maybe there's a listener"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"who's super familiar with the last, like,"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"five albums, which I'm not that familiar with."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Well, and also, you know,"
01:30:49;01:30:51;"Bruce is famously half-Irish,"
01:30:51;01:30:53;"half-Italian."
01:30:53;01:30:55;"A very classic East Coast combo."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"Mm-hmm."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"I mean, I'm sure he's, like, a very--"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"he's a guy who's really interested"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"in history. Very"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"intelligent, sensitive man."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"I'm sure he probably"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"has probably traveled through"
01:31:09;01:31:11;"Italy and Ireland, interested in, like,"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"where his family came from."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"He seems like that type of dude."
01:31:15;01:31:17;"But, like, did he ever write a song about it?"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"Yeah, I could see, like,"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"a late period song about, like,"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"his great-grandfather riding a boat over from Ireland."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Right."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"Like Ellis Island or something."
01:31:27;01:31:29;"I could totally see that. Maybe he set some rules"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"for himself, where he's like, it's all gotta take--"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"yeah, but even that song, like, takes place just, like,"
01:31:33;01:31:35;"20 miles out from the shores"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"of the U.S."
01:31:37;01:31:39;"No longer international waters."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"[laughs]"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"I found these covered when I"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"leave Berlin, live."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"What's that song?"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Let's put-- it's a"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"song by"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"Wiz Jones."
01:31:53;01:31:55;"Not familiar."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"But, yeah, I think that"
01:31:57;01:31:59;"that's the closest that seems"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"like a song that-- 'cause it is."
01:32:01;01:32:03;"It's very funny. It's like, you can't even hear--"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"you know, unlike, like, Paul Simon"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"or Dylan, you know, or someone"
01:32:07;01:32:09;"who you just, you know,"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"European or Middle Eastern"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"places sort of roll off"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"the tongue. Even the idea of him saying,"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"like, ""Bombay."""
01:32:17;01:32:19;"Right."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"It just doesn't feel right."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"I can't imagine. ""Beirut!"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Where you gotta--"" Yeah."
01:32:25;01:32:27;"I don't know. I'd love to hear it."
01:32:27;01:32:29;"I'd love to hear Bruce turning"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"his pen towards"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"another part of the world."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"But at the same time, maybe he, like,"
01:32:35;01:32:37;"he's found so many dimensions"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"to sing about the,"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"you know, the state of affairs in the U.S."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"like, decades in."
01:32:43;01:32:45;"He still finds new ways"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"to kind of explore that territory, so"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I bet somebody knows something."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"If you know any Bruce songs,"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"or even a moment in a song that's clearly set"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"outside North America,"
01:32:55;01:32:57;"please let us know."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"Alright, should we do the top five?"
01:32:59;01:33:01;"It's time for the top five"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"f-f-f-f-f-five"

01:33:09;01:33:11;"Winning the fight?"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"How about on the next Mountain Bruce EP"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"you just do, like, a rewrite that more"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"suits your sensibility, Jake?"
01:33:17;01:33:19;"Yeah. Am I the only one?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"I'm not willing to fight."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Um..."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"It's just, am I the only one"

01:33:27;01:33:29;"Oh, I like that."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"Could care less about the red and white"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"and the blue."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"No, that's not true. I mean, I do care about the red, white, and blue, but..."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"I mean, it could be like,"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"isn't, like, a Budweiser can have red,"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"red, white, and blue on it?"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"That's a tight call."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Another Bud's goin' down."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"How about a song where"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"you're at a Fourth of July barbecue"
01:33:49;01:33:51;"with a lot of Stained and Aaron Lewis"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"fans, and then people are like,"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"""Oh, hell yeah. You know what we're blastin' at this"

01:36:41;01:36:43;"You just want to hear the curt."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"Yeah, I wonder what"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"how this ties in, if at all,"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"thematically to what's happening in the movie."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"It's like, is it just supposed to be"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"like a melodramatic"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"song and... I'm sure it's like"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"Black Widow flying through"

01:36:59;01:37:01;"dudes and slitting their necks"

01:37:11;01:37:13;"that interpolated or just"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"sampled the ""hello"" part."

01:37:21;01:37:23;"yeah, clearly this is like..."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"It is just kind of funny, just like that"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"kind of stock"

01:38:41;01:38:43;"moments in Vietnam. Totally."
01:38:47;01:38:51;"Okay."
01:39:05;01:39:13;"Like a post-weekend"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"80s vibe. I like the intro"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"the most. So The Kid LAROI"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"is an Australian rapper and singer."
01:39:29;01:39:39;"Every time I hear Bieber,"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"I just keep thinking of Nick hanging out with"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Bieber at the"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"weird spa. Oh, at the spa?"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Talking about how Jesus is cool."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Yeah."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"Classic story."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"I now associate Nick with Bieber."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"I am"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"definitely like top"

01:40:01;01:40:03;"Top five life moments."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"Alright."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Fun song."

01:40:09;01:40:11;"this is somebody"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"truly a legend, one of the biggest"

01:40:19;01:40:21;"A major, major artist."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"He's been laying low for a couple years."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"Like pop?"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"You could say he often works in a pop idiom."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"But he"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"definitely knows his way around rock music."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"Is he over 40?"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"No, he's not over 40."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"Ed Sheeran? Ed Sheeran's"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"back. And you know, for a guy like"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"Ed Sheeran to go however long he went"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"a couple years without music is pretty deep."

01:41:50;01:41:55;"Probably won't be able to control you"
01:41:55;01:42:00;"Or do my best to keep you in my arms"
01:42:00;01:42:03;"You know I think you said this thing a second ago"
01:42:03;01:42:06;"about just like a post-weekend sound"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"Yeah, this guy had a post-weekend too"
01:42:08;01:42:11;"I think that, I hadn't really put it all together"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"but I think that that's it"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Like I think there's a lot of this going on"

01:42:17;01:42:18;"Yeah"

01:42:21;01:42:26;"Ooh"
01:42:26;01:42:29;"My bad habits lead to you"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Every pure intention ends"
01:42:31;01:42:32;"Yeah, it's a weekend mood"
01:42:32;01:42:36;"It's like 80s pop weekend vibe"
01:42:36;01:42:44;"Falling over everything to reach the first time spark"
01:42:44;01:42:52;"It started on the neon lights and then it all got dark"
01:42:52;01:42:58;"I only know how to go too far"
01:42:58;01:43:02;"My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone"

01:43:06;01:43:10;"Swimming this will be the last but it probably won't"
01:43:10;01:43:13;"I got nothing left to lose or use"
01:43:13;01:43:17;"Or do my bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"And I know I lose control"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"I would love to hear a version of this without that"
01:43:21;01:43:24;"this like really stiff EDM beat"
01:43:24;01:43:26;"That's what takes me out of it"
01:43:26;01:43:29;"I kind of like the verses before the drums drop"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"Yeah, it's not bad"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"It doesn't have the... I mean it's..."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"This is first listen, it's hard to say"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Yeah"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Just that..."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"Just like..."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Yeah"
01:43:41;01:43:42;"It takes me out of it"
01:43:42;01:43:53;"We took a long way round"
01:43:53;01:43:59;"But, 'til the fun runs out"
01:43:59;01:44:03;"My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone"
01:44:03;01:44:06;"Conversations with a stranger I barely know"

01:44:11;01:44:14;"I got nothing left to lose or use"
01:44:14;01:44:18;"Or do my bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space"
01:44:18;01:44:21;"And I know I lose control"
01:44:21;01:44:22;"True"
01:44:22;01:44:26;"You're not interested in hearing how it would be without the EDM beat?"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"I wanna hear like..."
01:44:28;01:44:32;"Still with a drummer but just not that EDM beat"
01:44:32;01:44:36;"I don't wanna hear just like a stripped down voice and acoustic either"
01:44:36;01:44:37;"You would like him to send you the stems?"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"I have very specific needs"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"You want him to send you the stems and you'll remix it?"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Essentially, yeah"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"Program some different drums"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"Just real quick, I wanna understand what this song's all about"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"The beginning says, ""Every time you come around, you know I can't say no"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control"
01:44:54;01:44:57;"I can feel the paradise before my world implodes"

01:44:59;01:45:02;"My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"Conversations with a stranger I barely know"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't"
01:45:07;01:45:10;"I got nothing left to lose or use or do"""
01:45:10;01:45:11;"Is this about like cheating?"
01:45:11;01:45:15;"I was gonna say, is it about like drinking or drugs?"
01:45:15;01:45:19;"Or is it about my bad habits or like addiction and ending up with..."
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Just partying too hard?"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Like, cause like he loses control or you know"
01:45:23;01:45:26;"Or is it like, there's something interesting about this"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"""My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone"""
01:45:29;01:45:33;"So that kind of sounds like, just like the person who's just like"
01:45:33;01:45:36;"Doesn't want the party to end but also is like"
01:45:36;01:45:39;"By the end it's like, birds are chirping, sun's out"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Everybody's like, everybody's asleep"
01:45:41;01:45:44;"And just like, ""Oh, am I really the only one who's gonna just like"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Have another beer? Alright, I guess I'm the only one who likes to party"""
01:45:46;01:45:48;"""Am I the only one?"""
01:45:48;01:45:50;"""Am I the only one crushing the brew?"""
01:45:50;01:45:53;"""Sun's coming up, what about you?"""
01:45:53;01:45:55;"And then, but he says"
01:45:55;01:45:58;"""My bad habits lead to late nights, ending alone"""
01:45:58;01:46:02;"And then says ""Conversations with a stranger I barely know"""
01:46:02;01:46:05;"So my interpretation of that is almost like"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"It's not even like this is like some person who's just like"
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Living life too hard, is like cheating"
01:46:12;01:46:16;"Or like, you know, having a series of like meaningless one night stands"
01:46:16;01:46:19;"And you know, abusing alcohol or whatever"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"This almost sounds like somebody who just like"
01:46:21;01:46:24;"Parties too hard, ends up having some kind of like"
01:46:24;01:46:27;"Lightweight conversations with people they don't even know"
01:46:27;01:46:30;"And then just like, yeah this is just like kind of like a sad dark story"
01:46:30;01:46:33;"Just like, getting sh*tfaced by yourself at the bar"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Rolling up to the bar to some people you don't even know"
01:46:35;01:46:36;"Just being like ""Oh, what's up guys?"""
01:46:36;01:46:39;"And they're just like ""Yeah, um, not much"""
01:46:39;01:46:42;"And you're like ""Alright, I'm gonna keep partying at my place"""
01:46:42;01:46:44;"And then everybody's like ""Cool"""
01:46:44;01:46:45;"And then you end up alone"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"That's kind of what it sounds like, it's sad"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Yeah, yeah, I think he's hammered"
01:46:49;01:46:52;"I think he's like, outside the bar at like 3 in the morning"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Drunk, maybe a little coked up"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Maybe trying to bum a cigarette"
01:46:56;01:47:00;"And just like, getting into some just innocuous conversations with people"
01:47:00;01:47:03;"""Hey man, you listen to Aaron Lewis?"""
01:47:03;01:47:06;"""No? Or you're missing out?"""
01:47:06;01:47:08;"""You probably listen to f*cking Bruce Springsteen or something"""
01:47:08;01:47:11;"Anyway, just like, wandering to the next person"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"He does say ""My bad habits lead to you"""
01:47:13;01:47:16;"But, there's not much of like a ""you"" in this song"
01:47:16;01:47:19;"Well maybe the ""you"" is ""Booze"""
01:47:19;01:47:20;"Right"
01:47:20;01:47:21;"I like the song a little more now"
01:47:21;01:47:22;"Yeah"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"One day we should really go deep on Ed Sheeran"
01:47:24;01:47:28;"Because I do feel like there's a lot we probably don't know"
01:47:28;01:47:31;"I mean, we just did like a whole episode on Aaron Lewis and Stain"
01:47:31;01:47:35;"So, maybe next time we do like, honestly"
01:47:35;01:47:41;"We pick half a dozen Ed Sheeran songs and really go to town"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"I haven't seen the video but"
01:47:43;01:47:47;"I know he dresses up like the Joker in it"
01:47:47;01:47:51;"Because I saw people talking about that he was entering his Joker phase"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"Oh my god"
01:47:52;01:47:53;"Talk about play out"
01:47:53;01:47:54;"I'm into that"
01:47:54;01:47:55;"Oh Christ"
01:47:55;01:47:56;"Really?"
01:47:56;01:47:57;"I'm into it"
01:47:57;01:47:58;"I don't know why"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"I'm into it"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"That's cool"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"I think you also just gotta keep in mind that like"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"Ed Sheeran is like such a thing"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"You know, he's such a massive star"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"So many hits"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"People have so many feelings about him"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"Because they either think of him like he said"
01:48:12;01:48:15;"Oh he's the acoustic guitar guy or whatever"
01:48:15;01:48:19;"That for him to like get Joker-fied"
01:48:19;01:48:21;"Is, I don't know"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"It's like interesting to me"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"He's real wholesome"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"He's wholesome and also he's like"
01:48:26;01:48:31;"Even if the Joker movie is like a few years too late"
01:48:31;01:48:35;"I think Ed Sheeran is such a massive center of gravity"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"As a cultural figure"
01:48:36;01:48:39;"That he's allowed to like come to it a little bit later"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"He can suck it into his orbit, you know?"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"I give him"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"This is also me not having seen the video"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"Just when somebody told me"
01:48:45;01:48:48;"Ed Sheeran dresses up like the Joker in his new video"
01:48:48;01:48:49;"I was just like, that rules"
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Also like"
01:48:50;01:48:53;"I just like the idea of Ed Sheeran just like sitting there"
01:48:53;01:48:56;"And being like two years after that movie came out"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"I wanna dress like the f***ing Joker in my video"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"Almost because it's a little played out"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"I almost give him more credit for it"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Maybe I'll whistle a different tune when I see the video"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"I mean"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"That's a very generous read, I love it"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"This is a kind vibe show, folks"
01:49:10;01:49:13;"Ezra's gonna give a generous read"
01:49:13;01:49:14;"But I'm, look"
01:49:14;01:49:15;"I'm not gonna name them"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"But there's a lot of artists"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"That if they did go Joker mode"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"I would be like"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"That's so played out"
01:49:21;01:49:23;"I'm just saying, I give"
01:49:23;01:49:24;"Yeah"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"What if Eminem went Joker mode?"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"That wouldn't work for me"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"Like old ass Eminem"
01:49:29;01:49:32;"48 year old Eminem"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"Ed Sheeran going Joker mode"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"I'm intrigued for it"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"Okay, how about this"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Harry Styles goes Joker mode"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"I'm less in"
01:49:42;01:49:43;"I respect him"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"But I'm less in because"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"I'd be like"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"What is that supposed to mean?"
01:49:48;01:49:49;"Like"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"Ed Sheeran like announcing to the world"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"I'm going into my Joker phase"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"Is surprising"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Intriguing, tantalizing"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Harry Styles going Joker mode"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"Would be a little like"
01:50:01;01:50:02;"Yeah, what's the point?"
01:50:02;01:50:03;"I think there's a reason"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"Harry Styles didn't go Joker mode"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"It wouldn't suit him"
01:50:05;01:50:06;"Bieber"
01:50:06;01:50:08;"Bieber, I wouldn't respect it"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"He'd just be like"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Dude, you're confused"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"What are you doing?"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"Yeah, Ed Sheeran going Joker mode"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"I guess I'm also giving him credit"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"That it's like purposeful"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"I'm starting to see what you're saying now"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"He's one of the few that can pull it off"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"I guess like if"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"Pull it off"
01:50:22;01:50:23;"You know what I mean?"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"If Phil Collins went Joker mode"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"You'd respect it, right?"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Now? Yeah"
01:50:28;01:50:31;"Like a 70 year old"
01:50:31;01:50:33;"Phil Collins"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"Putting on a new record"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"It's Phil Collins' first record of new music"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"In 22 years"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"And he's coming out"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"Joker mode"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"No, but Phil Collins in like '87"
01:50:45;01:50:46;"Going Joker mode"
01:50:46;01:50:49;"That would be before the Batman craze"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Would be sick"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"The number two song"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"Gonna pick up the pace"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Our old friends BTS"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Built a spill"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"Soul edition"
01:51:00;01:51:03;"With new song Permission to Dance"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"That's a funny title"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"It's the therapy"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"Oh, it's written by Ed Sheeran"
01:51:09;01:51:11;"Co-written with Ed Sheeran"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"Yeah, yeah"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"When it all seems like a swamp"
01:51:15;01:51:17;"Sing along to Elton John"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Until that feeling"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"We're just getting started"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"When the nights get colder"
01:51:24;01:51:28;"And the rhythms got you falling behind"
01:51:28;01:51:31;"Just dream about that moment"
01:51:31;01:51:35;"When you look yourself right in the eye"
01:51:35;01:51:36;"Oh, did you say"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"I wanna dance to music"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"Got me going"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"I'm feeling this"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"Yeah, this is fun"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Good chorus"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"Yeah, let's break our place"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"And itches like we're cold"
01:51:47;01:51:52;"And you're boring like we're dancing fools"
01:51:52;01:51:55;"We don't need to worry"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"'Cause when we fall we know how to let it"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"Don't need to talk the talk"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"Just walk the walk tonight"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"'Cause we don't need permission to dance"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"I'm way into this"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"This is the first BTS that's really excited me"
01:52:12;01:52:15;"I think that's maybe because of Mr. Ed Sheeran"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"Yeah, 'cause there's no looking back"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"There ain't no one to prove"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"We don't got this on lock"
01:52:22;01:52:25;"This is an interesting event upcoming"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"Global Citizen Live"
01:52:27;01:52:30;"A 24-hour special that will be broadcast live"
01:52:30;01:52:33;"From six continents on September 26"
01:52:33;01:52:38;"Ed Sheeran, The Weeknd, Billie Eilish, Metallica, and Green Day"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"Are just a few of the other performers"
01:52:42;01:52:45;"God bless Metallica and Green Day"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Still slugging it out"
01:52:47;01:52:52;"I love like BTS and Metallica like sharing a bill"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"That's really funny"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"It's interesting in that"
01:52:56;01:53:00;"Who's turning up just for Metallica"
01:53:00;01:53:03;"And then enjoying the rest of the music"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"This sounds so bad"
01:53:05;01:53:08;"It's a 24-hour special broadcast from six continents"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"So I bet Metallica will probably do a Metallica show somewhere"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"And they'll just cut in"
01:53:13;01:53:17;"We don't need permission to dance"
01:53:17;01:53:27;"Let me show you"
01:53:27;01:53:30;"That we can keep the fire alive"
01:53:30;01:53:34;"'Cause it's not over"
01:53:34;01:53:39;"'Til it's over, say it one more time"
01:53:39;01:53:42;"I wanna dance, the music's got me going"
01:53:42;01:53:46;"Nothing I can't stop how we move"
01:53:46;01:53:50;"Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"Rolling like we're dancing fools"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Dancing fools"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"We don't need to worry"
01:53:58;01:54:01;"'Cause when we want we know how to let it"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"Know how to let it"
01:54:03;01:54:05;"Let the music just flow"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"I love this song"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"It's good energy"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"It's a really good song"
01:54:11;01:54:14;"On the iTunes chart is a country song"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"By Walker Hayes"
01:54:16;01:54:19;"Off of his Country Stuff EP"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Off an EP? Very cool"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"It's an EP called Get Very Mountain Bruised"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"Country Stuff!"
01:54:25;01:54:27;"That's a Mountain Bruised title"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"That's sick"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"That's deeply bruised"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"Yeah, Country Stuff"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"And the song is called Fancy Like"
01:54:33;01:54:39;"This song went viral on TikTok"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"Nice"
01:54:41;01:54:46;"I'm interested in how many songs here are because of"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Them going viral on TikTok"
01:54:48;01:54:49;"A lot"
01:54:49;01:54:54;"Take her to Wendy's?"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Oh"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"What is this?"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Oh my god"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"Did I write this?"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"Seriously"
01:55:15;01:55:37;"This rules"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"I like how it's kind of like"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"It sounds kind of homemade too"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"I like it"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"She got it"
01:55:49;01:55:55;"So dancing"
01:55:55;01:56:01;"Hey, hey, hey"
01:56:01;01:56:07;"That's right"
01:56:07;01:56:12;"Get in the whip cream"
01:56:12;01:56:16;"Get in the whip cream"
01:56:17;01:56:19;"Get in the whip cream"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"You know what's cool?"
01:56:21;01:56:27;"On TikTok, a song can go viral just from the briefest moment"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"Totally out of context"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"This is the entire chorus"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"Is what went viral"
01:56:33;01:56:35;"Oh, the whole chorus?"
01:56:35;01:56:38;"It's a dance to the entire from Applebee's on"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"Through the Frosted Shake"
01:56:40;01:56:43;"So it's actually appreciation for the music"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"Is he drinking Natty Light out of a styrofoam cup?"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"I guess so"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"Bougie like that"
01:56:49;01:56:51;"And this is kind of a classic country trope"
01:56:51;01:56:56;"Where you kind of contrast concepts like fanciness"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"With whatever you do"
01:56:58;01:56:59;"Yeah"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"I talk about this song a lot"
01:57:00;01:57:03;"My dad always played this country duet called"
01:57:03;01:57:06;"We're Not the Jet Set, We're the Old Chevrolet Set"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"That song opens with whoever it is"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"I forget if it's the Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Or something like that"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"But they're singing to each other"
01:57:15;01:57:18;"About how they fell in love in Paris"
01:57:18;01:57:21;"And they kissed by a fountain in Rome"
01:57:21;01:57:24;"And they had this magical night in Athens"
01:57:24;01:57:27;"It has this kind of real European opening"
01:57:27;01:57:31;"Like romantic vibe"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"And then suddenly he goes"
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Rome, Georgia"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Paris, Texas"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"And Athens, Tennessee"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"And then it kicks in"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Where they're like, oh you thought we were talking about Europe"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"That's kind of like the Bruce Springsteen role"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"No Europe"
01:57:44;01:57:46;"You thought we were talking about Europe? No"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"And then they go"
01:57:47;01:57:48;"We're not the jet set"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"We're the old Chevrolet set"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"And then the whole thing is about"
01:57:52;01:57:55;"They got love and they don't need all that fancy sh*t"
01:57:55;01:57:56;"But here he's saying"
01:57:56;01:57:59;"Yeah we fancy like Applebee's on a date night"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"Got that Bourbon Street Steak with the Oreo shake"
01:58:02;01:58:06;"And then we're bougie like Natty and the styrofoam"
01:58:06;01:58:07;"Well the funny thing is"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"It's not like Applebee's is dirt cheap"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"He's not saying like"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"We're fancy like Dollar Tree"
01:58:13;01:58:16;"Two people getting sh*t faced on Applebee's on a date night"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"No I think that's the point he's making"
01:58:18;01:58:21;"But then he says we're bougie like Natty and the styrofoam"
01:58:21;01:58:22;"There's nothing"
01:58:22;01:58:23;"That's not actually bougie"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"Nobody on earth thinks that's bougie"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"I interpreted it as like"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"Applebee's was like"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"Like they're not fancy"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"And so like a big date night is going to Applebee's"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Getting the Oreo shake with the steak"
01:58:36;01:58:40;"Which is also an insane thing to do as an adult male"
01:58:40;01:58:42;"It's 2000 calories"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"The shake is or the steak?"
01:58:43;01:58:46;"The shake is 1100 calories"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"And the steak is 800 calories"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"Well then you get the fries"
01:58:51;01:58:52;"I mean that's"
01:58:52;01:58:55;"Yeah and then fries and beers"
01:58:55;01:58:56;"Also it's funny"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"Got that Bourbon Street Steak with the Oreo shake"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"Get some whipped cream on the top too"
01:59:00;01:59:01;"And then the ad lib is"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"Gotta add that whipped cream"
01:59:04;01:59:07;"A real working familiarity with the Applebee's menu"
01:59:07;01:59:10;"Yeah I guess there is something a tiny bit confusing about it"
01:59:10;01:59:13;"Because for many people in America"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"It would be fancy to go to Applebee's"
01:59:15;01:59:18;"And cause honestly this dinner sounds like"
01:59:18;01:59:19;"It's gonna"
01:59:19;01:59:20;"For two people"
01:59:20;01:59:22;"I'm seeing the bill"
01:59:22;01:59:25;"Especially if you give like a decent tip"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"I think we're getting up to 80-90 bucks"
01:59:27;01:59:28;"Right?"
01:59:28;01:59:31;"Yeah I mean what's that Bourbon Street Steak at Applebee's run?"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"I guess like 18.99"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"Can I get a number crunch Nick?"
01:59:35;01:59:38;"The Oreo shake is gonna run you like 7"
01:59:38;01:59:39;"Yeah and then"
01:59:39;01:59:41;"He might be closer to like 70 bucks"
01:59:41;01:59:42;"But yeah it's not"
01:59:42;01:59:44;"No but then two or three drinks each"
01:59:44;01:59:45;"Yeah I mean"
01:59:45;01:59:46;"Like alcoholic drinks"
01:59:46;01:59:47;"If you're kidding me"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"And fries"
01:59:48;01:59:49;"I like the combination of like"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"Beers and a milkshake"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"At the same time"
01:59:53;01:59:57;"No but Applebee's is a full bar man"
01:59:57;01:59:58;"They might be"
01:59:58;01:59:59;"$17"
01:59:59;02:00:01;"For the Bourbon Street Steak?"
02:00:01;02:00:02;"For the Bourbon Street Steak"
02:00:02;02:00:03;"I nailed that"
02:00:03;02:00:04;"No pun intended well done"
02:00:04;02:00:06;"But you're getting some sides too man"
02:00:06;02:00:08;"You're getting the like jalapeno poppers"
02:00:08;02:00:09;"No I think actually"
02:00:09;02:00:10;"I think this dinner is going to"
02:00:10;02:00:11;"100 easy"
02:00:11;02:00:12;"Yeah if you're drinking booze"
02:00:12;02:00:13;"Definitely"
02:00:13;02:00:14;"It's date night"
02:00:14;02:00:15;"Maybe you're dumping a little"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"Whiskey into that"
02:00:17;02:00:18;"Into that shake"
02:00:18;02:00:19;"Oh yeah"
02:00:19;02:00:20;"No but at Applebee's"
02:00:20;02:00:21;"You could straight up be"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"Pounding like"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"Just"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"Yeah vodkas"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"Vodka on the rocks with all this"
02:00:27;02:00:28;"Oh yeah"
02:00:28;02:00:29;"I think that's sloppy"
02:00:29;02:00:30;"Also we should point out that"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"The pre-chorus is"
02:00:32;02:00:33;"Is about"
02:00:33;02:00:34;"He basically is doing some"
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Classic country shit"
02:00:35;02:00:36;"That we don't need"
02:00:36;02:00:37;"No champagne"
02:00:37;02:00:38;"Poppin' entertainment"
02:00:38;02:00:39;"I can take her to Wendy's"
02:00:39;02:00:40;"Can't keep her off me"
02:00:40;02:00:41;"She wanna dip me"
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Like them fries in her Frosty"
02:00:43;02:00:44;"So he's saying like"
02:00:44;02:00:45;"We're not fancy"
02:00:45;02:00:46;"And then he says"
02:00:46;02:00:48;"In another verse he says"
02:00:48;02:00:49;"I don't need no Tesla"
02:00:49;02:00:50;"To impress her"
02:00:50;02:00:51;"My girl's happy"
02:00:51;02:00:53;"Rolling on a Vespa"
02:00:53;02:00:54;"Alright that's weird"
02:00:54;02:00:55;"Is that"
02:00:55;02:00:56;"Like"
02:00:56;02:00:57;"A Vespa's kinda chic"
02:00:57;02:00:58;"In it's own way"
02:00:58;02:00:59;"Anyway"
02:00:59;02:01:00;"We don't need no mansion"
02:01:00;02:01:01;"To get to romance"
02:01:01;02:01:02;"And again"
02:01:02;02:01:03;"Classic country shit"
02:01:03;02:01:04;"We're not fancy people"
02:01:04;02:01:05;"And then he says"
02:01:05;02:01:06;"Our version of fancy"
02:01:06;02:01:07;"Is Applebee's on a date night"
02:01:07;02:01:08;"That makes total sense"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"For most people"
02:01:10;02:01:12;"A hundred dollar date night"
02:01:12;02:01:13;"I mean for"
02:01:13;02:01:14;"Literally for like"
02:01:14;02:01:15;"95% of the country"
02:01:15;02:01:16;"That's like a lot of money"
02:01:16;02:01:17;"To spend on dinner"
02:01:17;02:01:18;"So yes that is fancy"
02:01:18;02:01:19;"But then he says"
02:01:19;02:01:20;"We're bougie like Natty"
02:01:20;02:01:21;"In the styrofoam"
02:01:21;02:01:23;"I guess now he's just being silly"
02:01:23;02:01:24;"Yeah"
02:01:24;02:01:25;"Cause for many people"
02:01:25;02:01:26;"A hundred dollar date night"
02:01:26;02:01:27;"Is fancy"
02:01:27;02:01:28;"I would say most people"
02:01:28;02:01:29;"But nobody thinks that"
02:01:29;02:01:30;"Natty in the styrofoam"
02:01:30;02:01:31;"Is bougie"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"So whatever"
02:01:32;02:01:33;"He's a little all over the place"
02:01:33;02:01:34;"But we get the point"
02:01:34;02:01:35;"And then he says"
02:01:35;02:01:36;"Some Alabama jam"
02:01:36;02:01:38;"She my Dixieland delight"
02:01:38;02:01:39;"I love that he named the album"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"Country Stuff"
02:01:41;02:01:42;"Cause he's just"
02:01:42;02:01:43;"He's just like"
02:01:43;02:01:44;"Yeah it's some country stuff"
02:01:44;02:01:45;"I'm just like"
02:01:45;02:01:46;"Riffing on the tropes"
02:01:46;02:01:47;"Of country music"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"Just some country stuff"
02:01:48;02:01:49;"Like that title really"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"Suggests that it's like"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"Self aware and funny"
02:01:53;02:01:55;"As opposed to"
02:01:55;02:01:57;"Aaron Lewis"
02:01:57;02:01:58;"I'm actually the son of hippies"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"From Vermont"
02:02:00;02:02:01;"Normally I do"
02:02:01;02:02:03;"I do more of a jam band thing"
02:02:03;02:02:04;"But for this EP"
02:02:04;02:02:05;"I just called it Country Stuff"
02:02:05;02:02:07;"Cause I'm just doing country stuff"
02:02:07;02:02:08;"Just listing country"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"A series of country tropes"
02:02:10;02:02:12;"That don't really reflect me or my life"
02:02:12;02:02:13;"But I thought maybe other people"
02:02:13;02:02:14;"Would relate to it"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"Well good for you Walker Hayes"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"I'm a huge Ween fan"
02:02:18;02:02:21;"And I guess also this"
02:02:21;02:02:23;"The song went viral on TikTok"
02:02:23;02:02:25;"Because Walker Hayes"
02:02:25;02:02:27;"Posted a video dancing with his whole family"
02:02:27;02:02:29;"His wife and his daughter"
02:02:29;02:02:31;"So that's kind of a"
02:02:31;02:02:32;"I guess a feel good story"
02:02:32;02:02:33;"I love it"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"The title of this episode is Country Stuff"
02:02:35;02:02:39;"We ended real strong with that BTS"
02:02:39;02:02:41;"And the Walker Hayes"
02:02:41;02:02:43;"Oh yeah excellent"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"I think we stick with the iTunes"
02:02:45;02:02:46;"For a while"
02:02:46;02:02:48;"Yeah yeah I like where this is taking us"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"Let's keep going down that route"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"Alright"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"Seinfeld just vanished in the middle of this"
02:02:54;02:02:56;"He had to go to a meeting"
02:02:56;02:02:57;"He had to go to a meeting?"
02:02:57;02:02:58;"He's a working man"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"He's a working man"
02:03:00;02:03:01;"Alright"
02:03:01;02:03:02;"Great seeing everybody"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"We'll be back in two weeks"
