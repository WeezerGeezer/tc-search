00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis back again in 2021"
00:03;00:06;"the years change"
00:06;00:08;"But the topics have not"
00:08;00:11;"We'll be talking about Herm Jarl"
00:11;00:13;"fish"
00:13;00:16;"Better than Ezra and so much more"
00:16;00:19;"This is a brand new"
00:19;00:24;"TC the first of 21 welcome back to"
00:24;00:28;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:28;00:30;"again"
00:41;00:56;"All my rightful chances But make sure clear, everything seems so easy"
00:56;01:08;"And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:18;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying Leave it on me, babe"
01:18;01:24;"Time Crisis back once again, 2021, let's do this."
01:24;01:26;"Jake, how you doing man?"
01:26;01:28;"I'm doing pretty well."
01:28;01:34;"I had fun making a Herm Yarl playlist today, that was fun."
01:34;01:35;"How are you?"
01:35;01:39;"Another day, another dollar man."
01:39;01:40;"Just grinding it out."
01:40;01:47;"I guess, yeah, I guess like most people 2021 just feels like a very arbitrary differentiation"
01:47;01:48;"between 2020."
01:48;01:51;"We're still living in the same moment."
01:51;01:56;"Very little's changed on any fronts, but you know, doing my thing, trying to get back into"
01:56;01:59;"some kind of groove, working here and there."
01:59;02:01;"I'm anxious to hear whatever you're working on."
02:01;02:02;"We got some good shit man."
02:02;02:04;"I'll be happy to play for you."
02:04;02:09;"I had a long day in the studio today, just trying to like come up with new stuff."
02:09;02:10;"You know how it is."
02:10;02:14;"It's like you come up with some **** that you're excited about and then, you know, eventually"
02:14;02:15;"you remember."
02:15;02:20;"You got to keep looking, keep panning for gold out there."
02:20;02:21;"No doubt."
02:21;02:23;"So how's the Herm Yarl?"
02:23;02:27;"For people who don't remember, anybody who's not a regular listener, if this is your first"
02:27;02:31;"episode of Time Crisis, maybe you're somebody who last year you heard a lot, you had a lot"
02:31;02:35;"of TC heads in your life saying, man, you got to get in with Time Crisis."
02:35;02:39;"You felt like, man, hundreds of hours worth of content."
02:39;02:40;"I don't know how I can fit in."
02:40;02:43;"And then maybe for your New Year's resolution was like, you know what?"
02:43;02:45;"I'm just going to get in."
02:45;02:47;"First episode 2021, I'm getting in."
02:47;02:53;"Might take me a second to kind of catch up with the rhythm, but I'm not going to go from"
02:53;02:54;"the start."
02:54;02:55;"I'm just going to get in 2021."
02:55;02:59;"So we'll try to be helpful in terms of contextualizing things."
02:59;03:05;"So Herm Yarl is a kind of character we created as a combination of Herm and Yarl, which are"
03:05;03:12;"two ways of describing that kind of 90s post-grunge singing."
03:12;03:14;"I associate a lot with Eddie Vedder."
03:14;03:19;"We're going to have a legendary producer, musician, Jack Endino, who I think coined"
03:19;03:20;"the phrase ""Yarl."""
03:20;03:21;"Did he coin it?"
03:21;03:24;"Or he popularized it in an influential essay?"
03:24;03:27;"Well, either way, we'll be talking to him about this whole phenomenon."
03:27;03:31;"But Jake, you started putting together a Herm Yarl playlist that we're going to share with"
03:31;03:32;"the TC community."
03:32;03:33;"I did."
03:33;03:38;"I crowdsourced to the Twitter audience as well."
03:38;03:40;"Got some good suggestions."
03:40;03:43;"What's like track one on the playlist?"
03:43;03:44;"Track one is a little bit weird."
03:44;03:50;"It's called The Witch of Westmoreland by this Canadian folk musician, Stan Rogers."
03:50;03:55;"He's like an Eastern Canadian folk musician who died in a plane crash in the 80s."
03:55;03:58;"He has kind of like a Gordon Lightfoot vibe or something."
03:58;04:02;"Wait, does he have a famous song about a ship?"
04:02;04:03;"Yes."
04:03;04:04;"Okay, I've heard of this dude."
04:04;04:09;"Anyway, I thought of him today when I was listening to all this deep baritone, ""yeah,"""
04:09;04:11;"kind of singing."
04:11;04:15;"And it has enormous nostalgic significance for me."
04:15;04:19;"And I listened to the song literally like eight times today."
04:19;04:23;"So you're tracing not only the genre of Herm Yarl, but also the roots."
04:23;04:27;"Well, yeah, it's called the playlist I made is called Herm Yarl Origins."
04:27;04:33;"So I wanted to have everything be released before the first Pearl Jam album, Ten, which"
04:33;04:38;"was released in like August or September of '91, I think."
04:38;04:41;"I got Green River by Creedence Clearwater."
04:41;04:44;"""Yeah, take me back down the road."""
04:44;04:48;"Yeah, Fogarty is super proto-Herm Yarl."
04:48;04:51;"I put two different Who songs on there."
04:51;04:52;"Interesting."
04:52;04:54;"I know Vedder's a huge fan of the Who."
04:54;04:55;"And then you know that song ""Bargain""?"
04:55;05:00;"They call it a bargain, the best I ever..."
05:00;05:05;"See sometimes Roger Daltrey, he can sing with a really sweet, sensitive kind of tenor."
05:05;05:11;"But sometimes he can really do this like guttural, kind of gnarly, like Southern Rock kind of"
05:11;05:12;"vibe."
05:12;05:14;"It's not that long."
05:14;05:18;"Oh, I got ""Easy Win"" by The Dead on there."
05:18;05:19;"Interesting."
05:19;05:24;"I got ""Annegada de Vida"" by Iron Butterfly, which is the last song, which is terrible"
05:24;05:25;"music."
05:25;05:28;"But it's not like the most fun playlist to listen to."
05:28;05:31;"It's more of an academic pursuit."
05:31;05:32;"Okay."
05:32;05:34;"This is for academics only."
05:34;05:35;"Yeah."
05:35;05:39;"Maybe the layperson might be more interested in the next playlist you make, which could"
05:39;05:42;"be Herm Yarl Aftermath."
05:42;05:44;"Right."
05:44;05:48;"At the end of the playlist, I put ""Hunger Strike"" by Tembo the Dog."
05:48;05:54;"Because I think Herm Yarl, people look at it with a sense of humor, but there are truly"
05:54;05:57;"transcendent musical moments of Herm Yarl."
05:57;06:00;"And I would say ""Hunger Strike."""
06:00;06:01;"Matt, you want to throw that on?"
06:01;06:02;"That's a beautiful song."
06:02;06:03;"""Hunger Strike"" is amazing."
06:03;06:12;"And it's like Cornell doing a really rich, kind of gorgeous, understated Herm Yarl."
06:12;06:13;"Just two flavors of Herm Yarl."
06:13;06:26;"This song is where Herm met Yarl."
06:26;06:27;"Hey, I'm Herm!"
06:27;06:28;"What's your name?"
06:28;06:29;"When Hermie met Yarlie."
06:29;06:30;"Gorgeous."
06:30;06:50;"I was texting with a friend of the show, Stephen Heiden, today about this."
06:50;06:54;"He was like, ""I get legit chills when a better comes in."""
06:54;06:55;"I feel that."
06:55;07:21;"And I was like, ""I totally feel that."""
07:21;07:23;"How high did this song make it in the charts?"
07:23;07:26;"Seinfeld, we had a number crunch."
07:26;07:28;"Was this like Billboard Top 40?"
07:28;07:30;"I feel like it was a big hit."
07:30;07:31;"It was definitely..."
07:31;07:40;"You know, it's just funny, sometimes with rock radio, it could be like number one, 1991"
07:40;07:43;"rock tracks, and then it's like peak 97."
07:43;07:46;"In the 90s, probably, it would have made it pretty high."
07:46;07:49;"Definitely on constant rotation on MTV."
07:49;07:55;"It peaked at number four on the US mainstream Billboard chart."
07:55;07:57;"Whoa, top five!"
07:57;07:58;"In '91."
07:58;07:59;"Man."
07:59;08:02;"Mainstream rock chart."
08:02;08:06;"So it wasn't the Billboard 200 or whatever?"
08:06;08:12;"No, they used to have a chart called ""Mainstream Rock"" that ranked the most played songs on"
08:12;08:14;"mainstream rock radio."
08:14;08:37;"I feel like there's also something about grunge music where some of these guitars have"
08:37;08:39;"a bit of a Herm Yarl too."
08:39;08:42;"The guitar yarls a bit."
08:42;08:47;"Yeah, I think it's Herm Yarl."
08:47;08:48;"Beautiful songs."
08:48;08:52;"Did the Temple of the Dog record come out after the first Pearl Jam album?"
08:52;08:54;"Yeah, it must have, right?"
08:54;08:58;"It must have, because at the time I was like, I remember, I knew who Eddie Vedder was already,"
08:58;08:59;"so it must have."
08:59;09:04;"I think we've talked about this on the show before, but it's so incredibly rare in the"
09:04;09:15;"rock world that there's just an iconic single where two very famous singers, front men,"
09:15;09:17;"front people come together like that."
09:17;09:22;"Obviously in hip hop we have that all the time, but as far as the early 90s goes, this"
09:22;09:26;"is like, especially in the early days of both their careers, this is like hearing Snoop Dogg"
09:26;09:30;"for the first time on The Chronic."
09:30;09:33;"Just Cornell and Vedder coming together."
09:33;09:35;"Like a 90s under pressure."
09:35;09:38;"Right, two of the rare examples."
09:38;09:41;"It happens way more in pop and hip hop."
09:41;09:43;"Yeah, I wonder why that's interesting."
09:43;09:45;"Hell of a song."
09:45;09:48;"Should we talk about the Vampire Weekend shirt?"
09:48;09:50;"Oh, the what, the 2021?"
09:50;09:52;"No, no, the eBay shirt."
09:52;09:53;"Oh, yeah."
09:53;09:56;"I don't know exactly how this came up."
09:56;09:57;"Who found this?"
09:57;09:58;"Was it you, Seinfeld?"
09:58;09:59;"Yeah, so, yeah."
09:59;10:00;"Do you want to kick this off?"
10:00;10:03;"We've got a little bit of a mystery on our hands."
10:03;10:08;"So a couple of years ago, would it have been 2019, '18?"
10:08;10:13;"That's when you did that Earth Day show, you did like a Vampire Weekend."
10:13;10:14;"That was 2019."
10:14;10:15;"2019."
10:15;10:20;"I had done like a tie-dye shirt."
10:20;10:22;"I had designed like an extremely limited tie-dye shirt."
10:22;10:24;"It was 20."
10:24;10:30;"And it was like this almost like meta, like self-referential Earth Day."
10:30;10:36;"It had the Seinfeld logo, but it was like merged with the globe art from the Father"
10:36;10:37;"of the Bride cover."
10:37;10:41;"And then it had the date of the shirt and the number of shirts, the amount of shirts"
10:41;10:42;"made."
10:42;10:48;"And it was something that you guys gave away at that like very intimate, I mean, it was"
10:48;10:51;"like this cool, interesting gathering."
10:51;10:52;"What was the location?"
10:52;10:53;"It was in the park."
10:53;10:55;"I guess it was technically Griffith Park."
10:55;11:01;"It was like some little inlet that somebody from our team found kind of in like Beechwood"
11:01;11:03;"Canyon area."
11:03;11:08;"And yeah, we wanted to do something for Earth Days, but it was kind of like, you know, to"
11:08;11:14;"do like a big show, if you really like invite people, you need to like involve the city"
11:14;11:17;"and you know, there's all sorts of rules and stuff."
11:17;11:19;"So we couldn't really just like invite the fans."
11:19;11:26;"So we did kind of like a friends and family acoustic, no PA, kind of like picnic."
11:26;11:33;"Yeah, I think a lot of the TC crew was there, like Marcus Mumford, some of the Himes came"
11:33;11:34;"through."
11:34;11:36;"Diplo was hanging out in a tree."
11:36;11:38;"It was a bunch of fun people rolled up."
11:38;11:42;"I remember we tried to live stream it, but there was like really bad service."
11:42;11:46;"So I think the fans probably caught like a few pixelated moments."
11:46;11:50;"But yeah, it was a chill thing and yeah, it was very cool that you made those shirts just"
11:50;11:51;"for the occasion."
11:51;11:53;"And truly, that's a beautiful shirt."
11:53;11:54;"Very few people have them."
11:54;11:59;"In fact, I know off the top of my head, I can think of at least a few people."
11:59;12:02;"My sister in law, friend of the show, Jonah Hill."
12:02;12:03;"He still rocks that sometimes."
12:03;12:06;"It was really well printed."
12:06;12:11;"And of course, we could never go wide with it because using the Seinfeld logo, of course,"
12:11;12:14;"Jerry and Larry would sue us in a heartbeat."
12:14;12:15;"We'd get CND real quick."
12:15;12:21;"So this was truly an original Seinfeld 2000 design, a real love of the game thing for"
12:21;12:24;"you know, kind of a kind vibe event."
12:24;12:29;"I just want to say if I remember correctly, we had a shirt that was being given away that"
12:29;12:31;"there was a larger run up."
12:31;12:40;"And specifically, this shirt was created to celebrate the t-shirt giveaway."
12:40;12:42;"So that was sort of the meta myth."
12:42;12:45;"Like if you got one of the other shirts, there were a limited group of people that"
12:45;12:50;"would get this other shirt that celebrated the idea that you're giving away another"
12:50;12:51;"shirt."
12:51;12:52;"Man, I totally forgot about that."
12:52;12:53;"That's right."
12:53;12:56;"It was like a shirt referencing another shirt."
12:56;12:59;"There were like levels to it."
12:59;13:01;"It was absurd."
13:01;13:02;"And yeah, there were what did we find?"
13:02;13:04;"There were 30 printed."
13:04;13:05;"Yeah."
13:05;13:07;"So the shirt is a bit of a lie."
13:07;13:09;"I think on the shirt, it says that there are 20 printed."
13:09;13:12;"And I looked into my emails, we'd actually produced 30."
13:12;13:15;"But I think it was funnier to say that there was even a smaller quantity."
13:15;13:20;"So there was like a lost 10 batch of 10 out there beyond what the shirt says."
13:20;13:24;"Yeah, well, the other 10 are, that's the angels share."
13:24;13:25;"That's right."
13:25;13:29;"I would be remiss if I didn't say to the one of the influences of that shirt."
13:29;13:34;"Do you know that company, Cactus Plant Flea Market that does a lot of like Kanye West"
13:34;13:37;"merch and like did some of the Travis Scott stuff and like,"
13:37;13:40;"Yeah, there's some kind of Pharrell connection, I think."
13:40;13:41;"Yeah, that's right."
13:41;13:43;"The designers friends with Pharrell."
13:43;13:47;"So I remember very distinctly photoshopping the Vampire Weekend logo to like make it a"
13:47;13:51;"little bit more like homemade looking the way the Cactus Plant Flea Market does."
13:51;13:54;"They sort of like, they kind of got the lettering a little bit."
13:54;13:55;"Anyway, whatever."
13:55;13:56;"That's just my own."
13:56;13:57;"No, no, no, no."
13:57;14:01;"Because that shirt, there's something about the ink, it feels like a little thicker."
14:01;14:03;"It does have a handmade quality."
14:03;14:05;"It's a very special shirt."
14:05;14:13;"And I would say it's definitely a top five grill in the VW Seinfeld 2000 TCU shirt universe."
14:13;14:17;"And I especially like the ones that it's not just like a limited run."
14:17;14:19;"It's like we couldn't sell this if we wanted to."
14:19;14:20;"You know what I mean?"
14:20;14:21;"True love of the game."
14:21;14:26;"You know, over the past like year, I've gotten like weirdly into like vintage t shirts and"
14:26;14:31;"I've been up on eBay like weird hours before bed on my phone just like poking around."
14:31;14:36;"And I guess eBay, like all websites and platforms will like show you stuff that they think you'll"
14:36;14:37;"be into."
14:37;14:44;"And so like, lo and behold, that shirt was recommended to me on eBay that somebody was"
14:44;14:48;"reselling for $75."
14:48;14:50;"So it was kind of this weird full circle thing."
14:50;14:55;"And then I texted you guys and then we started to get into like this sort of like Orient"
14:55;14:57;"Express style narrative."
14:57;15:02;"Try to hunt down essentially who of the very small intimate number of people who received"
15:02;15:08;"that shirt would have had the audacity to then resell it on eBay."
15:08;15:12;"It is funny when you know exactly how many well that yeah, they say it's only 20 copies"
15:12;15:14;"made because that's what it says on the shirt."
15:14;15:16;"But you know, only 30 were made."
15:16;15:22;"And no one went to Simi Hayes, DJ Influencer, Twins."
15:22;15:24;"I think we gave a few away to Randos."
15:24;15:25;"I just can't even remember."
15:25;15:27;"There were a few people I didn't know there."
15:27;15:29;"Yeah, here's the thing."
15:29;15:33;"I think Seinfeld, you were a little more like perturbed about who would sell this."
15:33;15:36;"You wanted to cuff them, get them in the slammer."
15:36;15:40;"I felt a little bit like, listen, I don't know, maybe it's like maybe somebody from"
15:40;15:43;"the band and they were like, I have so many Vampire Weekend shirts."
15:43;15:44;"I don't need this."
15:44;15:50;"There's a lot like I accept that there's a lot of people who could sell it."
15:50;15:52;"And maybe, you know, it's cool with me if they want to sell it."
15:52;15:56;"It is just funny to know that we're so close to knowing who it is."
15:56;15:58;"I think that's what motivated me."
15:58;16:01;"It wasn't like some sort of bloodlust to like hunt down the culprit."
16:01;16:05;"It was more like this is an actual like achievable."
16:05;16:11;"Like you could probably if we really all wanted to, we could probably figure out what the"
16:11;16:13;"origin point of this was."
16:13;16:16;"Incidentally, from the freezer, I think did end up buying the shirt."
16:16;16:18;"At least now we know who has it."
16:18;16:19;"Yeah."
16:19;16:22;"These shirts, it's like they're like Dragon Balls."
16:22;16:24;"There's a very set number in the world."
16:24;16:28;"At any given moment, everybody wants to know where they are."
16:28;16:32;"It's very important to like the power balance of society."
16:32;16:36;"So whoever sold it, it went to the right person from the freezer."
16:36;16:42;"And also shout out to from the freezer, because not only is he kind of like the foremost archivist"
16:42;16:47;"in the Vampire Weekend world, he runs the great social media accounts."
16:47;16:49;"It's cool to know that he's out there still collecting."
16:49;16:51;"I still think Seinfeld sold it."
16:51;16:57;"Hey, I would look, I told you I didn't even keep one for myself."
16:57;16:59;"That's how benevolent I am."
16:59;17:03;"But I agree that it's almost like it's found its way to the like Library of Congress of"
17:03;17:07;"like Vampire Weekend slash Time Crisis merch."
17:07;17:12;"And it does feel like it's sort of found a good home."
17:12;17:15;"But seriously, if you sold this shirt, hit us up."
17:15;17:18;"Just kind of want to hear your story and what's going through your mind."
17:18;17:19;"All right."
17:19;17:22;"So we got a real jam packed show today."
17:22;17:26;"We got lots of cover starting 2020 and off with a bang."
17:26;17:31;"But our first guest, maybe he'll want to talk about Herm Yarl, but I doubt it because his"
17:31;17:36;"favorite band has very little Herm or Yarl, I would say and they're singing."
17:36;17:45;"We got a dude named Dave Furch coming out of Florida, and he opened a fish themed bagel"
17:45;17:47;"and sandwich deli."
17:47;17:52;"It's called Split Open and Melt, which is a fish song."
17:52;17:55;"And Jake, you're the one who found this, right?"
17:55;17:56;"Yeah."
17:56;17:59;"I don't know why I somehow stumbled across it."
17:59;18:02;"And I immediately thought TC, obviously."
18:02;18:03;"I'm looking at the menu now."
18:03;18:05;"It's not even like the whole place is fish themed."
18:05;18:11;"It's music themed, but you fish kind of got pride of place inspiring the name."
18:11;18:16;"So let's get Dave on the horn and find out what's going on down at Split Open and Melt."
18:16;18:19;"It just opened last month, December 2020."
18:19;18:24;"Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
18:24;18:28;"Dave, welcome to Time Crisis."
18:28;18:32;"So where exactly are you down in Florida?"
18:32;18:33;"Fernandina Beach."
18:33;18:37;"It's like about half hour northeast of Jacksonville."
18:37;18:39;"What's the vibe out in Fernandina Beach?"
18:39;18:40;"I'm not familiar with it."
18:40;18:41;"I've been to Jacksonville."
18:41;18:45;"It's very touristy, but very laid back."
18:45;18:51;"It's a family town, but it relies a lot on a lot of people coming in to visit."
18:51;18:56;"A lot of golfing, a lot of nice hotels and places to stay."
18:56;19:03;"It's right on the beach, right on the Atlantic, so it makes for great tourism for everything."
19:03;19:04;"So what's the vibe right now?"
19:04;19:11;"I mean, you hear so many stories in the whole country about restaurants and cafes closing."
19:11;19:13;"You're opening this spot."
19:13;19:14;"What's going on in that part of Florida?"
19:14;19:15;"Are people out and about?"
19:15;19:17;"Are there still tourists coming down?"
19:17;19:26;"That was really something that I really struggled with and needed to think about when to open,"
19:26;19:27;"when was the right time."
19:27;19:34;"And I got to a point where it was just trusting my instincts, trusting what I've heard on"
19:34;19:35;"the news."
19:35;19:44;"You know, the vibe in Florida right now is it's not as strict as other parts of the country."
19:44;19:49;"And I'm not going to say whether that's bad or good, but the way that it is, it's more"
19:49;19:54;"relaxed probably than probably like other parts of the country."
19:54;20:00;"And I think the vibe is we want to get through it, but we're still going to mask up and do"
20:00;20:03;"what we have to do together to get through."
20:03;20:05;"The long-term goal is to get through it."
20:05;20:11;"How we do that, you know, wearing the masks and all that, you know, to get through it"
20:11;20:13;"is definitely important."
20:13;20:14;"Right."
20:14;20:17;"Well, and so your spot is named after a Phish song."
20:17;20:20;"Are you a massive Phish fan?"
20:20;20:23;"I've developed into one."
20:23;20:28;"I really enjoy their music and I've always gone back to Phish."
20:28;20:34;"I've seen them only 24 times, but I first saw them in 1995."
20:34;20:39;"So all I understand is some of the fans probably eclipsed me in one tour."
20:39;20:46;"I go back, you know, way back and I saw them when I was in college and they've always been"
20:46;20:51;"with me, you know, through, you know, the best days that I've had and the worst days"
20:51;20:52;"that I've had."
20:52;20:55;"So I always go back to them and really enjoy their jams."
20:55;20:59;"I really enjoy the fact that they don't repeat their setlist."
20:59;21:01;"I think that's really cool."
21:01;21:07;"And just the way that they engage with their fans really says a lot to me."
21:07;21:08;"So that's pretty awesome."
21:08;21:13;"Well, and also going back to '95, that's considered a real banner year for Phish."
21:13;21:14;"Yeah."
21:14;21:18;"So I know, because our producer said that you used the same phrase with him when you"
21:18;21:19;"guys were chatting."
21:19;21:21;"I've only seen 24 shows."
21:21;21:24;"I feel like you're being a little bit hard on yourself."
21:24;21:29;"I mean, just because in the Phish community, there are just people who have seen hundreds."
21:29;21:30;"Yeah."
21:30;21:33;"Because I imagine a lot of our listeners are like, ""24?"
21:33;21:35;"I've never seen anything 24 times."""
21:35;21:39;"But you have to be a little bit humble in a community of deep fans."
21:39;21:43;"There's a lot of people that have seen a lot of shows, so I have a lot of respect for those"
21:43;21:44;"fans that have."
21:44;21:45;"I think that's really cool."
21:45;21:51;"I also understand there's probably some fans that have only seen, you know, maybe a couple"
21:51;21:52;"times."
21:52;21:53;"So it's like a mixed bag."
21:53;21:55;"It's like a huge community."
21:55;21:58;"And Phish is a great band, and they're a lot of fun."
21:58;22:01;"I advise people to go see them as many times as they can."
22:02;22:07;"In the morning I pack up my gear and toss it in my carry-on."
22:07;22:11;"Rub my wide little tulip and watch the big coral crack and roll."
22:11;22:17;"In the evening I undo my belt, split open and melt."
22:29;22:35;"I wake up on my stomach with my face between my hands and crawl on the floor towards the"
22:35;22:37;"doorway."
22:37;22:45;"Jumping to my feet I try to pull myself together, but I feel it in my knees and the room begins"
22:45;22:46;"to spin."
22:46;22:52;"And I slip and put my head in ways of where all the belt splits open and melt."
22:55;23:01;"We've talked a lot on our show about which parts of the country are jam country."
23:01;23:05;"Because like LA, interestingly, is not so jammy."
23:05;23:07;"Obviously, Northern California is very jammy."
23:07;23:11;"I know that there are some very iconic Phish shows happened in Florida."
23:11;23:16;"In fact, they were down in Florida for maybe their biggest show ever, which was at New"
23:16;23:17;"Year's '99."
23:17;23:22;"But is the Fernandina Beach area jam country?"
23:22;23:25;"I would say it's more country than anything else."
23:25;23:26;"Country, country."
23:26;23:28;"Yeah, like country music."
23:28;23:32;"There's a lot of country music fans, but there's also a lot of rock fans too."
23:32;23:39;"So it's really a lot of people from the Northeast and Upper Midwest either move down here or"
23:39;23:40;"retire down here."
23:40;23:47;"So there's a lot of people that like Phish or are familiar with Phish or some kind of"
23:47;23:52;"jam band, widespread panic out of the Southeast."
23:52;23:57;"I'm Frizz McGee from Chicago area, obviously Grateful Dead."
23:57;24:03;"But Florida is like I said before, it's a very big mixture of a lot of different people,"
24:03;24:09;"not only who grew up here, but also people that are from other parts of America that"
24:09;24:10;"have moved down here."
24:10;24:11;"Sure."
24:11;24:14;"So, so far, I know you've only been open less than a month."
24:14;24:22;"Do you feel like the people coming down are disproportionately jam enthusiasts or rock"
24:22;24:25;"fans or is it like just bagel lovers?"
24:25;24:27;"A lot of both."
24:27;24:33;"And we've really had a great reception so far and I've really been like really overwhelmed."
24:33;24:38;"It's a mixture between people that are interested in the name and a lot of Phish fans have reached"
24:38;24:41;"out to me and said, hey, that's really cool."
24:41;24:44;"The next time I'm in the area, I want to swing by."
24:44;24:46;"And that's really meant a lot to me."
24:46;24:52;"Also, people from Jacksonville that like Phish or like, you know, jam bands or rock and roll."
24:52;24:55;"They also have an interest in checking the shop out."
24:55;25:02;"I'm named it after Phish, but every bagel name in the shop that we sell is named after"
25:02;25:03;"a music song."
25:03;25:09;"So I have all the albums from those artists up in my shop."
25:09;25:15;"So I have like a Grateful Dead bagel name called Help on the Way and I have their album"
25:15;25:18;"up in the shop with a little piece of artwork on there."
25:18;25:19;"So nice."
25:19;25:22;"That plus what's on the way."
25:22;25:23;"Oh boy."
25:23;25:27;"Roast beef and cream cheese on onion bagel."
25:27;25:28;"Whoo."
25:28;25:30;"Yeah, it's really good."
25:30;25:33;"And we steam our bagels so they come out nice and soft."
25:33;25:36;"I see you have a REM bagel."
25:36;25:37;"Talk about the passion."
25:37;25:40;"Yeah, that's a good name for a bagel."
25:40;25:43;"Yeah, it's a good one."
25:43;25:48;"Yeah, I just took some of my favorite songs, like some of my favorite artists and then"
25:48;25:52;"researched the song names and then went from there."
25:52;25:54;"As far as like that."
25:54;25:57;"Unfortunately, I didn't have anything for Vampire Weekend."
25:57;25:59;"So I apologize."
25:59;26:00;"It's all good."
26:00;26:01;"You know what?"
26:01;26:04;"We want to earn our bagel."
26:04;26:11;"We haven't played in the Jacksonville area, I think, since our first tour since like 2007."
26:11;26:15;"So we got to come back and win over some hearts and minds in the J-Ville area."
26:15;26:17;"You know what we can play here?"
26:17;26:21;"Specifically, we're going to come to Fernandina Beach and then maybe you could consider it."
26:21;26:23;"But no pressure."
26:23;26:25;"So you're making these bagels in-house?"
26:25;26:31;"No, we have a great supplier for the bagels and they're New York style bagels."
26:31;26:37;"And they come to us frozen and then we steam them in the steamer when we make the sandwiches."
26:37;26:45;"So they come out really nice and soft and melty and they make a great combination of flavors."
26:45;26:47;"Like while you're biting them."
26:47;26:50;"Do you have any background working in restaurants or food stuff?"
26:50;26:54;"Or is this just like a dream that you were jumping into headfirst?"
26:54;26:59;"I went to Miami University, which is just north of Cincinnati."
26:59;27:02;"I worked at the Bagel & Deli in Oxford, Ohio."
27:02;27:06;"Did that for a couple years and I really enjoyed it."
27:06;27:13;"And I always wanted to like recreate something in my life where I could open up something similar"
27:13;27:18;"that would like kind of pay homage to the time that I was working there."
27:18;27:21;"So that was really important to me."
27:21;27:24;"And you know, it just really impacted me."
27:24;27:29;"All the people that I worked with, folks that I worked for, Ned Stevenson and Gary Franks."
27:29;27:31;"They were great to work for."
27:31;27:40;"And we would literally bring in like all these kinds of music and listen to, you know, Grateful Dead, Bob Marley,"
27:40;27:44;"all these 90s bands that were coming up at that time."
27:44;27:49;"It was just like the time of my life when I really wanted to try to recreate that"
27:49;27:56;"by opening up something that was kind of like mimicking it, but not, you know,"
27:56;28:01;"I would never be able to recreate the same place because it's just really impossible."
28:01;28:04;"It's that like high up in my echelon."
28:04;28:05;"That's sick."
28:05;28:10;"Well, that kind of leads me into my next question because I love that vibe that you're describing"
28:10;28:16;"of kind of like an independent eatery where there's like college students working,"
28:16;28:20;"just playing whatever music they want, that kind of community feel,"
28:20;28:25;"which obviously in this world, especially post-COVID, we got less and less of."
28:25;28:28;"So that's sick that you're doing like a place that actually has a unique character"
28:28;28:31;"and that your goal is to build community like that."
28:31;28:36;"So I got to ask, is the bagel scene kind of like corporate in Fernandina Beach?"
28:36;28:39;"We've got a lot of Einsteins and things like that."
28:39;28:41;"What are you working with out there?"
28:41;28:45;"We have one other local shop that's small like me."
28:45;28:49;"They do a good job and they're a good competitor, but they don't steam their bagels."
28:49;28:53;"So we have a unique advantage over them right away."
28:53;28:55;"But they've been there for a couple of years."
28:55;28:57;"So a lot of people know them and like them."
28:57;29:01;"And then we have Panera, which they're okay also."
29:01;29:06;"But for the most part, it's just basically us two on the island."
29:06;29:08;"The pressure builds."
29:08;29:10;"You buy a gift."
29:10;29:13;"You're hoping that your dread will lift."
29:13;29:17;"It glitters on her like a glass."
29:17;29:18;"You shut her eyes."
29:18;29:20;"It comes to pass."
29:20;29:23;"Apologize to Luce and Lil."
29:23;29:25;"Converse with Ed."
29:25;29:27;"A drive with Jill."
29:27;29:30;"Your friends can find you in their worlds."
29:30;29:34;"One by one, a string of pearls."
29:34;29:37;"Confused you say, ""This isn't me."""
29:37;29:40;"You hover in their unity."
29:40;29:44;"Ashamed you slowly loose your grasp."
29:44;29:47;"Release the links, undo the clasp."
29:47;29:54;"The skin that drips down off the tree or peels back slowly from your knee"
29:54;29:58;"erupts into your lung and heart."
29:58;30:01;"You laugh and laughing fall apart."
30:01;30:04;"You know, in thinking about it, I've never actually been inside"
30:04;30:06;"because I remember it was closed last time I was there."
30:06;30:13;"But I know that there's a spot in Aspen, Colorado called the Grateful Deli."
30:13;30:16;"And they have, you know, obviously Grateful Dead themed stuff."
30:16;30:20;"And I feel like TC heads are always sending me pictures of the Grateful Deli in Aspen."
30:20;30:22;"So that's getting me thinking."
30:22;30:30;"I wonder how many like Jam Band inspired delis and cafes there are in the whole US"
30:30;30:34;"because I feel like you guys should probably form some sort of like alliance."
30:34;30:36;"Are you aware of any other ones?"
30:36;30:39;"Like you should have some sort of like, I don't know, maybe like an exchange program."
30:39;30:44;"People want to like work between them or I don't know."
30:44;30:46;"Have you heard of any other ones?"
30:46;30:49;"I haven't, but that's a great point."
30:49;30:51;"I mean, I'm sure there are other ones."
30:51;30:54;"I mean, when I was doing the research for the name of the shop,"
30:54;30:57;"I just Googled Split Open ML."
30:57;31:02;"And, you know, nobody had that name as far as anything in Florida."
31:02;31:04;"So I was able to use that."
31:04;31:10;"And then I wrote Fish for their approval and they wrote me back and said that was fine."
31:10;31:14;"But there's a lot of creative people in the food and beverage industry."
31:14;31:20;"So I'm sure that there are a lot of other ones that definitely could be in the network for sure."
31:20;31:24;"There's Fire in the Mountain Buffalo Wings in Portland, Oregon."
31:24;31:25;"Oh, right."
31:25;31:26;"Okay."
31:26;31:28;"Where's that one located?"
31:28;31:29;"Portland, Oregon."
31:29;31:30;"Okay."
31:30;31:32;"Off to go there next time I'm there."
31:32;31:35;"Well, any TC heads, if you're aware of any, because this is the exact type of thing."
31:35;31:37;"It's not that easy to Google."
31:37;31:38;"Right."
31:38;31:41;"If anybody has any, I really think this would be cool that they're--"
31:41;31:44;"I just feel like all you guys should be in contact with each other."
31:44;31:49;"And I feel like that should at least exist somewhere on the Internet, like a map,"
31:49;31:54;"especially because when concerts come back, nobody's on the road more than like jam band fans."
31:54;31:55;"Yeah."
31:55;31:57;"So that could be like a fun trip."
31:57;32:02;"Like, oh, we're going down to Florida to hit Split Open and Melt, then we're ripping west."
32:02;32:07;"I don't know what there is in between Florida and Colorado, but at the very least,"
32:07;32:11;"we're going to get out to Grateful Deli and then we're going to hit Fire in the Mountain Wings."
32:11;32:13;"I bet there's so many small ones all over."
32:13;32:14;"Yeah."
32:14;32:20;"The one thing I learned, there's a Facebook page called You Enjoy My Food."
32:20;32:24;"I wasn't aware of that, but somebody told me that."
32:24;32:32;"And you can go on Facebook and search You Enjoy My Food, and it's all fish fans that are foodies,"
32:32;32:39;"and they'll post pictures of either fish or other places that they've found."
32:39;32:41;"Well, congratulations."
32:41;32:46;"And I really hope--I mean, really got to believe that it's only going to get better"
32:46;32:49;"because you opened at such a challenging time."
32:49;32:57;"So, I mean, imagine by like spring break this year, one way or another, it's going to be slam."
32:57;33:03;"That's kind of amazing to think that as crazy as this past year was,"
33:03;33:10;"Florida will basically not have missed a single spring break season because it was jammed last year."
33:10;33:17;"And this year, a lot of people will be vaccinated by then, and I think it'll be a big season."
33:17;33:22;"Anybody down in the J-Ville area, check out--by the way, is it okay to say J-Ville?"
33:22;33:26;"I don't live there anymore, so I'm going to give you approval to do that."
33:26;33:27;"Okay."
33:27;33:30;"I'm not going to stand in your way because it is your podcast."
33:30;33:31;"Thank you."
33:31;33:35;"Well, it's an internet radio show, but--"
33:35;33:38;"Are there any nicknames for Fernandina Beach?"
33:38;33:40;"No, not that I know of."
33:40;33:43;"The Dina?"
33:43;33:44;"You can make it now."
33:44;33:46;"I mean, I'm sure people have called it that."
33:46;33:49;"Okay, well, anybody down there, you got to go check it out."
33:49;33:57;"And again, please, I really think it would be fun and useful to kind of put together the jam band eatery map of the U.S."
33:57;33:58;"I mean, f***ing the whole world."
33:58;34:01;"Maybe I could make a Reddit, you know, like a subreddit."
34:01;34:03;"Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely."
34:03;34:08;"Oh, and I guess last question, is there room in the shop for concerts?"
34:08;34:15;"We could do maybe like a tiny desk concert setup, maybe."
34:15;34:16;"Okay."
34:16;34:18;"We have space."
34:18;34:25;"We only have 17 chairs right now, so we definitely have room, you know, because of social distancing."
34:25;34:31;"So we definitely have room for, you know, throwing a couple guitars and a drum set in."
34:31;34:34;"You know, by all means, you're welcome to come in and do that."
34:34;34:36;"All right, good to know."
34:36;34:38;"Well, sick. Thanks so much, dude."
34:38;34:44;"Good talking to you and yeah, good luck with the continued launch and the continued success of the shop."
34:44;34:46;"Thank you, appreciate it."
34:46;34:47;"Good talking with you, Ezra."
34:47;34:49;"Appreciate it. Have a good day."
34:49;34:55;"I want a bagel now."
34:55;34:58;"Got to go down to Furby."
34:58;35:02;"Wait, Fernadina Beach, a.k.a. Furby."
35:02;35:03;"That's a great one."
35:03;35:05;"That's better than the Dina."
35:05;35:09;"Yeah, especially because there's already a Dina where Richard Pictures plays."
35:09;35:14;"Yo, this could be a million dollar idea because this, what if this is like the biggest spring break ever?"
35:14;35:21;"What if we roll down to Fernadina Beach and make Furbies that say like Furby?"
35:21;35:23;"We could kind of like own this somehow."
35:23;35:29;"We'll do the uncut gems blinged out Furby on a surfboard down in Fernadina Beach."
35:29;35:32;"Wait, what's a Furby? I don't remember what that is."
35:32;35:34;"Really?"
35:34;35:35;"Here we go."
35:35;35:37;"Well, it's a toy. Does that jog your memory?"
35:37;35:42;"It was a popular toy, I guess. Late 90s, early 2000s."
35:42;35:43;"No."
35:43;35:47;"It was the Tickle Me Elmo of what, a couple of years."
35:47;35:49;"Oh, I missed that."
35:49;35:54;"It has these big goggly eyes that look left to right and they can blink."
35:54;35:56;"Did you see Uncut Gems?"
35:56;36:03;"In Uncut Gems, there's like a brief shot where the guy shows this kind of like diamond encrusted Furby chain."
36:03;36:04;"Okay."
36:04;36:07;"Was the Furby actually like a crude artificial intelligence?"
36:07;36:09;"Didn't Furbies have machine learning?"
36:09;36:13;"I think they did have futuristic machine learning capabilities."
36:13;36:19;"I think it could say a few rudimentary phrases, right? Like, ""I love you"" and stuff."
36:19;36:22;"I think it would learn. It would like observe and learn."
36:22;36:23;"That sounds terrifying."
36:23;36:26;"There's an article called Furby the Primitive AI."
36:26;36:27;"Oh, really?"
36:27;36:28;"Yeah, Peripedia."
36:28;36:29;"I wrote it."
36:29;36:34;"You wrote it? A newly purchased Furby starts out entirely speaking Furbish,"
36:34;36:38;"but is programmed to use English words and phrases over time."
36:38;36:41;"But this toy was a big deal 20 years ago?"
36:41;36:43;"It came out in 1998."
36:43;36:50;"Get this. The updated Emotronic Furby had voice recognition and complex facial movements."
36:50;36:54;"It was sold by Hasbro between '05 and '07."
36:54;36:56;"Now's a great time to bring back Furby."
36:56;36:59;"Hold on. Let me see if they still make them."
36:59;37:05;"I'm looking at Amazon right now. Yeah, they're selling Furbies."
37:05;37:07;"You can buy a Star Wars Furbacca."
37:07;37:09;"So I guess there's still a market for it."
37:09;37:13;"Maybe they're just not quite as popular as they used to be."
37:13;37:16;"All right, so we know what to get Jake for his next birthday."
37:16;37:17;"It's coming up."
37:17;37:19;"Oh, yeah. When is your birthday?"
37:19;37:20;"February 3rd."
37:20;37:22;"Oh, yeah. Real soon."
37:22;37:24;"Turning the ripe old age of 44."
37:24;37:25;"That's a strong age."
37:25;37:27;"That's a real ass age."
37:27;37:29;"44 years old."
37:29;37:34;"So our next guest is a legendary producer and musician."
37:34;37:35;"His name is Jack."
37:35;37:39;"I'm putting my money on Endino, but I could send Dino."
37:39;37:42;"We're going to clarify with the man himself."
37:42;37:46;"He produced Nirvana's first album, Bleach."
37:46;37:53;"He's also produced albums for bands like Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Hot Hot Heat, Winnebago Deal, Valiant Thor, and many more."
37:53;37:56;"He's released music as a solo artist."
37:56;38:01;"He's also been in bands like Candy Coated."
38:01;38:08;"The reason that we reached out to him in the first place, though, is because he wrote a post on his website in the year 2000."
38:08;38:13;"Kind of amazing to think we're talking about a 20-year-old blog post."
38:13;38:16;"And he wrote about the world Jarl."
38:16;38:18;"And he defined it thus."
38:18;38:26;"""To Jarl is to sing melodramatically with a sort of barely suppressed letter R sound lurking beneath every other syllable."""
38:26;38:28;"Yeah, that checks out."
38:28;38:31;"The R, just like the omnipresent."
38:31;38:34;"""When I mention it, people always know exactly what I mean."
38:34;38:39;"Steve Turner describes it as singing as though your lower lip is stuck way out."""
38:39;38:44;"I think this post kind of put a lot of people onto the phrase Jarl."
38:44;38:51;"In the year 2000, I guess, yeah, it's interesting to think that was still kind of like prime Jarl territory."
38:51;38:54;"I mean, that was the height of Creed, really."
38:54;38:59;"And he specifically points out Creed. He says, ""The singer for Creed is the current expert."""
38:59;39:00;"""Cranroot!"""
39:00;39:03;"He writes that in a really funny way. You should go read the post."
39:03;39:06;"""Cranroot trick me how!"""
39:06;39:08;"He basically puts an R into every word."
39:08;39:10;"""He Jarls in their big radio song."
39:10;39:14;"Days of the new coming to mind, God smack, there are plenty of others."
39:14;39:19;"The problem is that the current crop of Jarlers are copying their shtick from our homeboys, Lane and Eddie V,"
39:19;39:21;"who are actually quite restrained at Jarling."
39:21;39:24;"Eddie hardly did it at all after the first PJ album."
39:24;39:27;"Chris Cornell never did it, nor Arm."""
39:27;39:28;"Don't agree."
39:28;39:32;"""Lanigan and Cobain sure as hell didn't need to."
39:32;39:36;"Nonetheless, it's now Seattle singing to some people's sigh."
39:36;39:39;"Friends don't let friends Jarl. Please stop the madness."""
39:39;39:44;"So it seems like Jack is unequivocally negative on Jarling."
39:44;39:48;"Yeah, although that was a very specific moment in time. 2000."
39:48;39:53;"I wonder how the passage of time might have contextualized his feelings."
39:53;39:58;"Can you ask him about his take on Alanis Morissette and the female faction of the-"
39:58;39:59;"That's a great question."
39:59;40:00;"Yeah, it's a great question."
40:00;40:01;"That's really good."
40:01;40:07;"You could throw on that Scott Stapp, Florida Marlins song."
40:07;40:11;"Have you heard that, Ezra? Or was that on the thread? I forget."
40:11;40:13;"It sounds familiar. I don't know if I listened to it."
40:13;40:16;"Was it he wrote a song for the Florida Marlins?"
40:16;40:17;"Yeah."
40:17;40:21;"""Let's split bullets in D.L.A."
40:21;40:25;"We want strikeouts, base hits, double plays."
40:25;40:30;"Let's take a field, hero on the crowd."
40:30;40:35;"Come on, Marlins, make us proud."
40:35;40:42;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will soar."
40:42;40:44;"With a little-"
40:44;40:48;"The lyrics are kind of like someone who's never seen baseball, you know?"
40:48;40:50;"We want hits."
40:50;40:53;"We want pitches."
40:53;40:56;"One strike, two strikes, swing away."
40:56;41:00;"One tight pitch, a stolen base."
41:00;41:05;"One tight pitch, a stolen base."
41:05;41:06;"Base."
41:06;41:10;"A perfect game, a triple play."
41:10;41:12;"Oh, yeah. He's never actually seen baseball."
41:12;41:14;"Yeah, I was."
41:14;41:20;"A perfect game and a triple play are the most obscure and rare occurrences in baseball."
41:20;41:27;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will soar."
41:27;41:36;"With a little faith and love, you will soar."
41:36;41:42;"Keep hoping and dreaming that you will soar."
41:42;41:44;"It's so serious."
41:44;41:48;"Keep hoping and dreaming and you will what?"
41:48;41:50;"I've got to find the lyrics to this."
41:50;41:53;"Double plays."
41:53;41:56;"He really is like the Uber yarl."
41:56;41:58;"Yeah, I mean, he took it to the next level."
41:58;42:01;"He took it to absolute God level."
42:01;42:04;"Oh, it's keep hoping and dreaming and you will soar."
42:04;42:05;"Okay."
42:05;42:09;"So Scott Stapp played baseball in high school."
42:09;42:11;"And this is a funny quote about him playing baseball."
42:11;42:13;"Something, again, just makes me sound like he--"
42:13;42:15;"It just sounds to me like he doesn't actually play baseball."
42:15;42:20;"He says, ""I remember getting a hard hit ground ball to me,"" Stapp said."
42:20;42:23;"""I fielded it cleanly. I had a little ego about my arm."
42:23;42:26;"I crow hopped, took a good look over it first,"
42:26;42:28;"and didn't realize how fast Johnny Damon was."
42:28;42:33;"It was the first time I ever had somebody beat me at a routine ground ball."""
42:33;42:35;"Wait, so he was playing baseball with Johnny Damon?"
42:35;42:36;"I'm confused."
42:36;42:38;"I don't know who Johnny Damon is, so I don't know."
42:38;42:40;"Is that a famous baseball player?"
42:40;42:41;"Yeah."
42:41;42:42;"Oh, it was 1990, earlier in the article."
42:42;42:47;"It was 1990, and Stapp was playing for Orlando's Lake High Highland Prep"
42:47;42:51;"in the APACA Invitational Tournament against Orlando."
42:51;42:54;"Dr. Phillips' team, stacked with future major leaguers,"
42:54;42:58;"Damon, AJ, Paritsky, and Brian Barber."
42:58;43:00;"And so I guess he was like a--"
43:00;43:01;"He's a serious guy."
43:01;43:02;"Yeah."
43:02;43:06;"You hear these stories about these such gifted athletes,"
43:06;43:08;"like a LeBron or something."
43:08;43:13;"I think he got an offer to play football in college or something."
43:13;43:17;"You know, you hear about these people who go on to really dominate one sport,"
43:17;43:21;"and sometimes you find out that they were like a three-sport athlete in high school"
43:21;43:23;"and they kind of could have done any of them,"
43:23;43:25;"and they even had offers on the table."
43:25;43:27;"And it's interesting that for Scott Stapp,"
43:27;43:31;"it might have not been multiple sports, but it might have been music and baseball."
43:31;43:37;"Like, he's clearly a kind of like gifted, charismatic, alpha male type."
43:37;43:42;"And to know that he was in the mix playing with people who would go on to the MLB,"
43:42;43:48;"it makes me wonder if he had taken the challenge that he had felt from, you know,"
43:48;43:50;"coming up against Johnny Damon in high school,"
43:50;43:53;"and he had put that right back into baseball,"
43:53;43:57;"maybe we'd be talking about him as the guy who played for the Marlins."
43:57;43:59;"But maybe instead he was like, ""You know what?"
43:59;44:02;"I am passionate, but it's more about music,"" or something like that."
44:02;44:07;"I feel like that story was like he realized in that moment the limits of his talents"
44:07;44:10;"and turned the other way towards music or something."
44:10;44:14;"It was like, I thought my arm was strong and I was cocky,"
44:14;44:17;"and then Johnny Damon just flew down the first baseline."
44:17;44:20;"And I'm out of my element here."
44:20;44:22;"That's how I interpreted it."
44:22;44:25;"Well, yeah, I think that's ultimately the decision he made."
44:25;44:27;"But one way or another, he was going to, yeah."
44:27;44:31;"For all we know, Johnny Damon saw Scott Stapp on the field and had a similar feeling,"
44:31;44:35;"and he chose to use that feeling of insecurity to fire himself up,"
44:35;44:37;"and he put it right back into baseball."
44:37;44:41;"Whereas Scott Stapp, he made maybe a smart decision."
44:41;44:45;"Or maybe Johnny Damon had a proto-grunge band in high school,"
44:45;44:49;"and he saw Scott Stapp tearing it up at the talent show,"
44:49;44:55;"battled the bands, and he was like, ""I got to stick to playing shortstop."""
44:55;44:58;"The sliding doors moment."
44:58;45:04;"This would be a pretty tight movie or miniseries that is just about"
45:04;45:07;"what if in that moment they switched."
45:07;45:09;"Scott Stapp was fired up for that game."
45:09;45:11;"Johnny Damon was having an off day."
45:11;45:14;"I think about [expletive] like that all the time with athletes."
45:14;45:18;"I actually recently watched this documentary that the Safdie brothers made"
45:18;45:22;"about Lenny Cook, who was like a kind of iconic New York area."
45:22;45:24;"Do you remember him, Jake?"
45:24;45:26;"Sure, of course. Is that a new doc?"
45:26;45:29;"No, it came out a long time ago. It just happened to be streaming."
45:29;45:33;"And for people who don't know, Lenny Cook was at one point"
45:33;45:38;"considered the number one prospect for high school basketball players in America."
45:38;45:42;"He seemed like a very likely person to go straight into the NBA,"
45:42;45:44;"like Kobe style."
45:44;45:47;"He had been having some bad luck, maybe made some bad decisions,"
45:47;45:51;"and when he finally went into the draft, no team drafted him."
45:51;45:56;"But when he was young and he was playing in these high school tournaments,"
45:56;45:59;"the best of the country, he was going head to head with people like LeBron,"
45:59;46:03;"Carmelo Anthony, people like that."
46:03;46:06;"You think about these key moments."
46:06;46:13;"Here's a guy who played LeBron once when they were 17 or 18."
46:13;46:18;"And that day, LeBron happened to be in better form."
46:18;46:22;"You just think about how much in something like sports,"
46:22;46:26;"how much one day could impact how you feel about yourself,"
46:26;46:28;"how the world perceives your team."
46:28;46:30;"I mean, obviously, even if you have a bad game,"
46:30;46:32;"you have to just keep working through it."
46:32;46:35;"But just think about, what if he just kind of got a little bit luckier in that game"
46:35;46:39;"and he kind of just made LeBron fall down or something?"
46:39;46:40;"Who knows?"
46:40;46:44;"And it is just very dramatic to think about LeBron considered"
46:44;46:47;"one of the maybe the best basketball player of all time"
46:47;46:49;"versus a guy who didn't even get drafted."
46:49;46:52;"But there was a moment where they were talked about in the same breath."
46:52;46:56;"So, anyway, I think it's very possible that there could have been--"
46:56;46:59;"Also, maybe the reason I'm saying this about Scott Stapp is"
46:59;47:01;"because he just looks like such a baseball player."
47:01;47:03;"I just can see him in the uniform now."
47:03;47:06;"Now that we know this, that he played, I can just see--"
47:06;47:09;"And I'm picturing-- I know he's had struggles in his life"
47:09;47:12;"and I know he's had a hard life in many ways,"
47:12;47:16;"but I'm picturing him just in his kind of peak creed days,"
47:16;47:19;"just that long hair, he's in great shape, very handsome guy,"
47:19;47:21;"just kind of a golden god."
47:21;47:23;"I can just picture him wearing a baseball uniform."
47:23;47:26;"I can picture him on the Yankees."
47:26;47:29;"This is Scott Stapp from Florida."
47:29;47:32;"Dude, I can picture him as a real sweaty reliever."
47:32;47:34;"[laughs]"
47:34;47:36;"Like a closer, coming in in the ninth inning,"
47:36;47:40;"just throwing 98. Everything is just fire."
47:40;47:41;"I can totally see it."
47:41;47:43;"You know who I always thought--"
47:43;47:45;"I mean, they're probably around the same age, actually."
47:45;47:49;"Who'd be great as Scott Stapp in a movie is Colin Farrell."
47:49;47:52;"Oh, yeah. Colin Farrell, get the long hair on Farrell."
47:52;47:53;"Yeah."
47:53;47:55;"Let's see if we can get Farrell attached--"
47:55;47:56;"[laughs]"
47:56;47:59;"Let's see if we can get Farrell attached to the project."
47:59;48:01;"Imagine that we somehow use connections"
48:01;48:04;"to get Colin Farrell on a Zoom and we're just like,"
48:04;48:07;"""Mr. Farrell, did you know that in high school,"
48:07;48:10;"in one game, Scott Stapp was up against Johnny Damon?"""
48:10;48:12;"He'd just be like, ""I don't know either."
48:12;48:14;"Who the f*** you're talking about?"
48:14;48:17;"Who the f*** is Johnny Damon? I don't know Johnny Damon."""
48:17;48:19;"That was my really bad Irish accent."
48:19;48:22;"""Farrell, are you familiar with the American band Creed?"
48:22;48:24;"They're s***y, man."""
48:24;48:27;"[laughs]"
48:27;48:31;"Okay, so now we got Jack on the horn,"
48:31;48:34;"the man who wrote the definitive essay on Yarling"
48:34;48:36;"and an iconic producer and musician."
48:36;48:37;"Let's talk to him."
48:37;48:41;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
48:41;48:45;"[phone ringing]"
48:45;48:47;"Hey, Jack, how are you doing?"
48:47;48:48;"Yes, sir?"
48:48;48:50;"You're on with me. Ezra, Jake is also here."
48:50;48:52;"Thanks so much for coming on Time Crisis."
48:52;48:53;"Well, a pleasure."
48:53;48:55;"And we just want to double check."
48:55;48:57;"Is your last name pronounced ""andino""?"
48:57;48:58;"Yes."
48:58;49:04;"Okay, so we've been talking about Yarling for quite a bit."
49:04;49:06;"As one does."
49:06;49:07;"As one does."
49:07;49:10;"I mean, so you wrote this essay 20 years ago"
49:10;49:13;"and obviously you observed, as somebody,"
49:13;49:16;"such a huge part of the Seattle scene,"
49:16;49:20;"you observed a concept, mistakenly perhaps,"
49:20;49:22;"taken from that world."
49:22;49:25;"So you watched the 20 years of it growing"
49:25;49:28;"and somehow in 2020, we're still talking about it."
49:28;49:31;"I don't know how much the world is still talking about it."
49:31;49:32;"I'm not sure why."
49:32;49:34;"Why are you guys still talking about this?"
49:34;49:36;"[laughs]"
49:36;49:39;"Well, I guess we were trying to get to the bottom of it"
49:39;49:40;"is really how it started"
49:40;49:43;"because it's such a specific way of singing."
49:43;49:46;"So first of all, in the original essay,"
49:46;49:48;"the post that you wrote in 2000,"
49:48;49:51;"which I think kind of popularized the term ""Yarl"","
49:51;49:54;"you give credits to your friends for creating the term."
49:54;49:55;"Is that correct?"
49:55;49:58;"Yeah, a drummer in a band I was in actually was using the word"
49:58;50:00;"and he described it to me and I thought,"
50:00;50:02;"""Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about."""
50:02;50:04;"Because we were talking about somebody,"
50:04;50:05;"a mutual friend of ours,"
50:05;50:07;"who was kind of singing that way"
50:07;50:08;"and then I realized that,"
50:08;50:10;"""Oh, wait a minute, this is much more widespread."""
50:10;50:14;"It's something maybe Eddie Vedder did a little bit in the early days"
50:14;50:18;"and my good friend Ben in Gruntruck did a little bit."
50:18;50:21;"But then you can go back to other singers,"
50:21;50:23;"Blood, Sweat & Tears, The Guest Who,"
50:23;50:25;"and Al Green a little bit."
50:25;50:27;"And you can go forward from that"
50:27;50:30;"and you've got terrible second-generation grunge bands"
50:30;50:33;"of the '90s that were doing it."
50:33;50:34;"And it was kind of painful."
50:34;50:36;"Right, because we were picturing the moment"
50:36;50:39;"when you were writing about it in 2000."
50:39;50:41;"That was still when Creed was massive."
50:41;50:43;"So you were right in the middle of seeing this,"
50:43;50:47;"whatever you call this, post-grunge, post-Seattle thing."
50:47;50:50;"Creed was the one that sort of triggered my ire at that exact point."
50:50;50:52;"But I think there was another band called Godsmack"
50:52;50:53;"that did it a little bit,"
50:53;50:55;"although I may be wrong"
50:55;50:56;"because I don't own any of their records,"
50:56;50:59;"so I can't really say for sure."
50:59;51:00;"But there were other bands."
51:00;51:01;"I remember tuning in my FM radio"
51:01;51:03;"and hearing other bands that were doing it"
51:03;51:05;"and being kind of annoyed."
51:05;51:07;"And you know, I don't hear it anymore, thankfully."
51:07;51:11;"But so, as somebody who was actually there in Seattle,"
51:11;51:13;"part of this whole world,"
51:13;51:15;"when--because it was interesting, in the essay,"
51:15;51:19;"you said that, ""To you, Eddie Vedder only yarled"
51:19;51:21;"on the first PJ album."""
51:21;51:23;"And you said that Cobain never yarled."
51:23;51:24;"Is that still your stance?"
51:24;51:25;"Yes, correct."
51:25;51:28;"The way I understand it, yes, that's exactly right."
51:28;51:30;"Looking backwards,"
51:30;51:33;"when I picture, you know, the first time I heard Nirvana"
51:33;51:34;"or Pearl Jam,"
51:34;51:35;"it's hard to put your finger on"
51:35;51:38;"what actually connects the singing of"
51:38;51:41;"Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell."
51:41;51:42;"They're all so different."
51:42;51:45;"And yet, they do feel like they have something in common."
51:45;51:48;"And it's not very easy for me to find the precedence."
51:48;51:50;"Because, like, obviously, a lot of people would say,"
51:50;51:53;"like Jake's uncle often famously said,"
51:53;51:55;"you know, ""Nirvana, just a punk band."""
51:55;51:57;"And, of course, you see the way that the energy"
51:57;51:59;"and the aesthetics of punk influenced Kurt."
51:59;52:01;"It's hard for me to think of, like, a punk singer"
52:01;52:04;"before Nirvana who sang like that."
52:04;52:06;"So, when you first heard these bands..."
52:06;52:07;"No, there wasn't any."
52:07;52:08;"Yeah, so when you first heard these bands,"
52:08;52:09;"did you already have a feeling of, like,"
52:09;52:12;"""Whoa, this is a new type of singing""?"
52:12;52:13;"Well, no."
52:13;52:16;"I mean, it's derived from '70s hard rock."
52:16;52:18;"Pearl Jam in the early phases,"
52:18;52:20;"people used to sort of compare them to Bad Company"
52:20;52:21;"and some sometimes."
52:21;52:23;"But the thing is, all those guys,"
52:23;52:26;"well, at least Kurt and, you know,"
52:26;52:29;"Laine Staley and Eddie,"
52:29;52:32;"they all have sort of gravelly mid-range voices."
52:32;52:35;"You know, not your Geddy Lee kind of high-spinning"
52:35;52:36;"kind of thing."
52:36;52:37;"Right."
52:37;52:39;"But, you know, so we didn't really have..."
52:39;52:41;"The stereotypical metal screamer"
52:41;52:44;"was not really a thing here in Seattle."
52:44;52:46;"Or Mel could do that if he wanted to."
52:46;52:49;"You've heard me on ""Ultra Mega OK"""
52:49;52:52;"where he actually hits his high register."
52:52;52:54;"But that wasn't, you know, in general,"
52:54;52:56;"he didn't do that on that many songs."
52:56;52:59;"He generally sang at his low range a lot of the time."
52:59;53:02;"So, you know, the y'all thing is just,"
53:02;53:03;"it's a mannerism."
53:03;53:05;"It's not about the tone of the voice."
53:05;53:08;"It's about the way you make the letter R,"
53:08;53:12;"you know, and the way you curl the lip a certain way."
53:12;53:15;"And it's a little hammy, it has to be said."
53:15;53:17;"And I don't think Kurt ever had that."
53:17;53:19;"It was kind of his own deal."
53:19;53:23;"♪ I meet an easy friend, I do ♪"
53:23;53:26;"♪ With a ear to lend, I do ♪"

53:45;53:47;"It's interesting that you're, like, tying it back"
53:47;53:51;"to '70s rock as being the origin."
53:51;53:53;"I'm just curious, just as you, you know,"
53:53;53:55;"being a producer and musician at that time,"
53:55;53:58;"and Jake, you're a Gen X expert,"
53:58;54:00;"you might have some opinions."
54:00;54:02;"I guess for me, and this goes beyond Yarling,"
54:02;54:05;"as someone who was, like, I was young,"
54:05;54:07;"but, you know, I was following those bands"
54:07;54:09;"as a kid in the '90s."
54:09;54:11;"I guess the interesting thing about grunge to me"
54:11;54:13;"when I was kind of taking in all these images"
54:13;54:17;"was, like, I always thought of punk rock"
54:17;54:20;"and '70s hard rock as being, like,"
54:20;54:22;"opposite ends of the spectrum."
54:22;54:23;"You know what I mean?"
54:23;54:25;"Like, bad company, very unpopular."
54:25;54:26;"- They were."
54:26;54:27;"- So then it's interesting to me that--"
54:27;54:28;"- Until grunge."
54:28;54:29;"- I was always confused about grunge."
54:29;54:31;"Yeah, so to you, grunge is like a synthesis?"
54:31;54:33;"'Cause I remember being a kid, and I'd be, like,"
54:33;54:35;"you know, listen to Pearl Jam and Soundgarden,"
54:35;54:38;"I'd be like, yeah, this sounds like rock,"
54:38;54:41;"like '70s rock, and then you'd see, like,"
54:41;54:43;"people describing Nirvana as being, like,"
54:43;54:45;"a punk band, and that there was that movie"
54:45;54:47;"that 1991, the year punk broke--"
54:47;54:49;"- Only people who've never heard punk would say that."
54:49;54:50;"- Right."
54:50;54:52;"- It's like people's idea of what punk"
54:52;54:54;"must have been like, and it's nonsense."
54:54;54:56;"- Right, so you felt like the whole grunge movement"
54:56;54:59;"was almost like the end of punk,"
54:59;55:02;"like a return to just, like, big '70s rock?"
55:02;55:04;"- I think it was kind of--it took a--"
55:04;55:06;"there was a branch of '70s hard rock"
55:06;55:10;"that kind of petered out around 1975, '76,"
55:10;55:13;"and was displaced by punk rock and disco"
55:13;55:15;"and electronica and, you know,"
55:15;55:17;"all these other sort of styles came about"
55:17;55:19;"at the end of the '70s, and that led to"
55:19;55:22;"the new wave of heavy metal and all this other stuff."
55:22;55:25;"So the grunge thing was kind of going back"
55:25;55:29;"to a sort of a '70s aesthetic with the riffs, okay?"
55:29;55:31;"Because you'll notice a lot of the grunge stuff"
55:31;55:32;"is riff rock."
55:32;55:35;"It's got big, fat riffs in it, okay?"
55:35;55:38;"But the attitude and the aesthetic of it,"
55:38;55:41;"like, the stance, if you will, was very punk rock."
55:41;55:43;"Like, these were people who had grown up"
55:43;55:44;"listening to their big brothers,"
55:44;55:47;"you know, Zeppelin and Black Sabbath records,"
55:47;55:48;"but they'd also listen to"
55:48;55:50;"Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys."
55:50;55:54;"And so you don't get the ""Wheels and Rainbows"""
55:54;55:55;"kind of lyrics."
55:55;55:56;"Instead, you get, you know,"
55:56;55:58;"""You get Grandma, take me home,"""
55:58;55:59;"and ""I'm a negative grief,"" and..."
55:59;56:00;"- Right. - So it's kind of like"
56:00;56:03;"punk aesthetic grafted onto '70s riff rock."
56:03;56:06;"That was the early grunge stuff to me."
56:06;56:07;"I mean, if you listen to Bleach,"
56:07;56:09;"I mean, ""Negative grief"" is kind of"
56:09;56:12;"communication breakdown, if you think about it."
56:12;56:13;"- Yeah, that's a great way to put it,"
56:13;56:15;"'cause, I mean, yeah, I imagine, Jake,"
56:15;56:17;"for you, it's, like, kind of obvious,"
56:17;56:18;"but for me, I was always kind of like,"
56:18;56:20;"""Yeah, the punk and the hard rock,"""
56:20;56:21;"and, yeah, maybe it is,"
56:21;56:23;"the music is hard riff rock,"
56:23;56:25;"but the themes and the lyrics"
56:25;56:27;"are way more in that punk vein"
56:27;56:30;"and thematically, like you said."
56:30;56:31;"- Exactly."
56:31;56:33;"They're much more sort of timely, exactly."
56:33;56:36;"I mean, I've taken this analogy further."
56:36;56:38;"Think of Smashing Pumpkins."
56:38;56:39;"Now think of ELO."
56:39;56:40;"- Right."
56:40;56:41;"- Think of Dinosaur Jr."
56:41;56:42;"and think of Electric Hot Tuna."
56:42;56:43;"Nobody's gonna get that."
56:43;56:44;"That's obscure."
56:44;56:45;"- [laughs]"
56:45;56:46;"- But, I mean, it's like,"
56:46;56:47;"for a lot of those bands,"
56:47;56:50;"I can think of, like, sort of analogous bands"
56:50;56:53;"from the '70s that had similar styles, you know,"
56:53;56:54;"and then everybody seemed to look back"
56:54;56:56;"at Aerosmith and Zeppelin and Sabbath"
56:56;56:58;"to some extent, as well as the punk stuff."
56:58;56:59;"- Right."
56:59;57:00;"One question that we had,"
57:00;57:02;"just because we've been talking about"
57:02;57:04;"a lot of the iconic grunge bands"
57:04;57:07;"of male singers, but our guy Seinfeld 2000,"
57:07;57:10;"also on the show, he had an interesting question."
57:10;57:12;"Can women yarl?"
57:12;57:14;"- You know, I don't see why they can't."
57:14;57:16;"I can't think of any that did."
57:16;57:19;"Maybe because they tend to have higher-pitched voices,"
57:19;57:20;"but I can't think of any that did."
57:20;57:22;"And you can probably think of some,"
57:22;57:24;"but offhand, I'm thinking of, like,"
57:24;57:26;"Babes in Toyland and L7,"
57:26;57:27;"which were two bands of that era"
57:27;57:28;"that I worked with,"
57:28;57:30;"and you certainly couldn't say they yarled."
57:30;57:32;"- Did Alanis Morissette yarl?"
57:32;57:34;"- Well, I never really listened to her."
57:34;57:35;"[laughs]"
57:35;57:37;"So I can't tell you."
57:37;57:38;"Did she?"
57:38;57:42;"- I mean, she had a very specific thing going on."
57:42;57:44;"Did Alanis Morissette yarl?"
57:44;57:45;"Hard to say."
57:45;57:48;"Let's listen to the beginning of ""You Oughta Know,"""
57:48;57:50;"and Jack, hopefully as you listen"
57:50;57:53;"to a low-quality stream of this song"
57:53;57:54;"through your phone,"
57:54;57:57;"you get enough information to determine"
57:57;57:58;"if she's yarling."
57:58;58:01;"- Am I the one making this determination?"
58:01;58:03;"- I feel the responsibility is heavy--"
58:03;58:06;"heavy on my shoulders here, yes."

59:27;59:29;"there's that little bass moment jumped out,"
59:29;59:30;"you know, that's Flea on bass."
59:30;59:33;"- Sick. - Yeah."
59:33;59:35;"Yeah, you know, like, especially, Jack,"
59:35;59:39;"your definition, which is about the,"
59:39;59:42;"the way you described it as the barely suppressed letter R"
59:42;59:43;"in every other syllable."
59:43;59:45;"- Oh, yeah, like a pirate."
59:45;59:47;"- If you have to have the R to yarl,"
59:47;59:49;"I'm not hearing the R in Alanis' voice."
59:49;59:50;"- Well-- - Like, of course,"
59:50;59:52;"she has the angsty anger"
59:52;59:55;"that you could associate with grunge,"
59:55;59:56;"but I don't hear the R."
59:56;59:57;"- No, agree."
59:57;59:59;"- Maybe it's 'cause she's Canadian."
59:59;01:00:01;"I guess Nickelback kinda yarls,"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"and they're famously Canadian."
01:00:03;01:00:04;"- Oh, yes, they did, yeah."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Well, they're pretty Canadian, yeah, true."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"- Well, so then, I guess I got a bigger question"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"to move past yarling."
01:00:10;01:00:14;"You're working on Bleach with Nirvana, 1988,"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"and then by the year 2000,"
01:00:16;01:00:20;"Creed is one of the biggest bands in America."
01:00:20;01:00:22;"What was that 12-year journey like?"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"You really watched culture change."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Like, that's a hell of an arc, you know,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"from '88 to 2000."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"- I was kind of in the engine room watching it change,"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"you know what I mean? - Yeah."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"- The USS grunge was kind of, like,"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"getting up to full speed,"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"and it was kind of disturbing watching it"
01:00:40;01:00:44;"sort of be co-opted and adopted by the mainstream"
01:00:44;01:00:46;"and mutated thereby."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"You know, by '94, '95,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"the thing had pretty much run its course,"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"and we were on to the next thing,"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"which was, at the time, it was Britpop,"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"and then there was Nu Metal with, you know,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"Fred Bernstein and his buddies and Korn and so forth."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And then, by the end of the '90s,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"there was sort of a resurgence of rock and roll bands,"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"here in Seattle, at least."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"And I found myself working on records for Zem Gorilla"
01:01:10;01:01:13;"and The Makers and Zeke and the Murder City Devils"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"and just a bunch of great bands"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"that kind of came back around again."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"At the end of the '90s, that were not grunge bands."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"No way, no how."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"And that led me to where I am today."
01:01:23;01:01:25;"I'm still recording bands pretty much full-on."
01:01:25;01:01:27;"Not so many in the COVID era,"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"but a lot of mixing and mastering."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"But at the time, you know, the '90s were strange."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"When grunge kind of exploded and splattered"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"on everybody's windshield there,"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"I started taking production gigs in foreign countries"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"as much as I could,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"because I was getting the offers"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"and I wanted to travel."
01:01:43;01:01:47;"So I ended up making weird, obscure indie records"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"in, you know, to date, 14 other countries."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- Whoa."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"- I'm not sure how much they helped my career,"
01:01:53;01:01:56;"but they helped my view of the world out a great deal."
01:01:56;01:01:57;"- And you're still in Seattle."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"- Oh, yeah."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"- You've been based in Seattle most of your life,"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"although we see you're originally from Connecticut,"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"same place Jake's from."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- Originally from Connecticut, yeah."
01:02:04;01:02:06;"Moved out here in '74."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"Pretty much never looked back."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- One thing we've talked about on this show"
01:02:09;01:02:12;"is Jake's made the point over and over again."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"I don't necessarily agree, but he's from Connecticut."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"He can say it, that he believes Connecticut's"
01:02:16;01:02:18;"not pulling its weight musically."
01:02:18;01:02:21;"Is that something that's been on your mind at all?"
01:02:21;01:02:24;"Is that why you kind of ride more for Seattle?"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"- I was pretty darn young when I left Connecticut,"
01:02:26;01:02:28;"so it's hard for me to judge, really."
01:02:28;01:02:32;"I haven't been back other than a few times during tours."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"But, you know, I will say that"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"back when my band, Skinyard, was touring,"
01:02:37;01:02:40;"I think we only played a show once in Connecticut"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"the whole time we were together."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"There didn't seem to be much of a scene there going on,"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"at least in the late '80s and early '90s."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Connecticut was like, you drove through it"
01:02:49;01:02:52;"between your gig in New York and your gig in Boston."
01:02:52;01:02:53;"You know? - Right."
01:02:53;01:02:56;"- It was kind of, you know, oh, there's Highway 84."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"You know, and I still don't really hear,"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"you know, where's the music scene?"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Is there one? Are there clubs?"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Are there bands? There must be."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Did they move to New York? What do they do?"
01:03:05;01:03:08;"- Yeah, I guess it's because people tend to leave."
01:03:08;01:03:11;"But there's, you know, there's definitely great bands there."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"And then, you know, of course, there's people from Connecticut,"
01:03:13;01:03:17;"like a Rivers Cuomo or a John Mayer."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"- Sure. - A Michael Bolton."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"- Hmm, all right."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"- Jake's brother, Dave, has a band, Dirty Projectors."
01:03:23;01:03:24;"Great band."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"But again, not a Connecticut-based band, just--"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"- It's come up so much because there's so many"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"legendary acts from New Jersey."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"If you're talking about the New York tri-state area,"
01:03:32;01:03:35;"Connecticut, New Jersey, New York,"
01:03:35;01:03:38;"New York and New Jersey are really, like,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"producing historic, iconic acts."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"- It's true. Connecticut and Rhode Island are kind of--"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"you're right, they're not pulling their weight, really,"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"such as it is."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"- And at least Rhode Island has the excuse of being, like,"
01:03:49;01:03:50;"the smallest state."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"So Connecticut, it's, you know--"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"it's a great state, though."
01:03:55;01:03:56;"I'm a fan."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"- Hmm, no comment."
01:03:58;01:04:01;"- [laughs]"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"This is rare, though."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"We have two people born in Connecticut"
01:04:04;01:04:06;"on the show at the same time."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"What town are you from in Connecticut?"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"- Southbury."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"You're from Southbury?"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"- Correct."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- That's where I'm from."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"- Seriously?"
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- I'm dead serious."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Born and raised. - That's amazing."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"- Pendletown Road."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"- Know it well."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"So you left Southbury in '74?"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- Correct."
01:04:28;01:04:32;"- I was born in '77, so we did not cross paths, but--"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"- No. [laughs]"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"Our lives did not intersect."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"- That's unbelievable."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"This is a great connection we just made,"
01:04:38;01:04:43;"'cause also I'm picturing Jake, a big rock fan."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"I'm sure in the early '90s,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"you're probably listening to Bleach,"
01:04:47;01:04:52;"having no idea that it was produced by a Southbury native."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"No idea. - That's kind of weird."
01:04:54;01:04:56;"I don't hear about Southbury, Connecticut, very often,"
01:04:56;01:04:58;"you know? [laughs]"
01:04:58;01:05:01;"- No, it's absurd. - Not surprisingly."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"- The year I left and been to high school,"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"the high school was so underfunded"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"that they were going on some kind of double sessions"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"the year after I left."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"The politics of that town were very weird."
01:05:10;01:05:13;"- It's a real, like, kind of Republican town, still is."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"- Heritage Village in the middle of town"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"was just getting bigger and bigger, I remember."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"- Sure."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"So was-- [laughs]"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"Sorry, this is so deep."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"Was it Pomparog High School in the '70s?"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- Pomparog, no, it was--"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Let me think."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"It was just called Southbury High School."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Pomparog was the grade school, if I remember right."
01:05:29;01:05:30;"- Yeah, I went there."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"- No, that was Rochambeau, actually,"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"was the grade school."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"- It was Pomparog Elementary and Rochambeau Middle School."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"I went to both of those."
01:05:37;01:05:38;"- Correct. Yes."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"And then SHS was the high school."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"Yeah, that is kind of terrifying."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Now, don't bring me back to these thoughts, actually."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"- Okay, we can move on. We can move on."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"It's just--"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"- I mean, let's move on from this."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Sorry, everybody listening to this."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"It's like--"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"- No, no, this is what the fans want to listen to."
01:05:53;01:05:55;"This is what this show is all about."
01:05:55;01:05:58;"Okay, but we'll stop asking you Connecticut questions."
01:05:58;01:06:01;"- It's freaky 'cause I never run into anyone from Southbury."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Ever."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"It's very weird."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"- Wow."
01:06:05;01:06:08;"I love the image, though, of young Jake listening to Bleach,"
01:06:08;01:06:11;"having no idea that it's in any way connected"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"to Southbury, Connecticut."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"- Yeah."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"- Now, Jake, this might be something else"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"that you don't want to talk about,"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"and it's fair if you don't."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"On this show, we talk about the Grateful Dead a lot,"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"and I'm just curious,"
01:06:22;01:06:25;"when you're talking about the influence"
01:06:25;01:06:29;"of '70s hard rock in the Seattle scene,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"and I'm just picturing you working with Nirvana,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"playing in bands,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"knowing all these people in that world,"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"were there a bunch of deadheads?"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"'Cause we kind of got the impression"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"that Kurt was, like, very anti the dead."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"Was the dead unpopular in that scene?"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Were they considered passé at the time?"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"Do you have a take?"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"Were there any connections there?"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"- You know, this is funny,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"because among people that I play in bands with now,"
01:06:54;01:06:58;"who are almost entirely 10 or 15 years younger than I am,"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"I can think of several deadheads"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"of the younger generations."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"You know, and in the grunge years,"
01:07:04;01:07:07;"even though I was slightly older than most of my clients,"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"only by a couple of years,"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"I didn't mention the Grateful Dead to anybody."
01:07:10;01:07:13;"I saw the Grateful Dead a couple of times back in the day."
01:07:13;01:07:14;"- Ah."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"- And they're a part of my record collection."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"I mean, I've got a stack of, like,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"you know, a couple dozen dead records"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"next to the Black Sabbath albums,"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"and the Grand Hogs records,"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"and the Hawkwind records."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"- Hmm."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"- I was kind of a big Dead fan."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"I mean, there's a time and a place when,"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"you know, I really enjoy listening to"
01:07:30;01:07:31;"some of their records."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"Blue Sparrow was a big favorite of mine."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:07:34;01:07:37;"- I don't think the Dead were really on anybody's radar"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"that much back in the grunge era, really,"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"but I always appreciated them,"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"because I think improvisation"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"is an important part of rock music."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- Uh-huh."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"- And I have to say that I have an improv band now."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"It's called Beyond Captain Orca."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"We have a band campsite,"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"because it's a three-piece."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"I play guitar, I have a drummer,"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"and a bass player,"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"who are younger than I am,"
01:07:57;01:07:59;"but they're both kind of into a lot of jazz"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"and Dead and improv stuff."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"- Oh, okay."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"- And we improvise."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"We basically, the three of us get on stage,"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"and we improvise for a half an hour,"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"and we record every show."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And we've been doing it for, like,"
01:08:10;01:08:11;"about four years now,"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"and when I can, I bring my full Pro Tools rig"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"and record it multitrack and mix it down,"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"and we put it up on our band campsite."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- Oh, awesome."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"- Every show is different,"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and we have no songs and no singer,"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"and no rehearsal,"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"and no overhead as a band."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"I think it's the band of the future."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"(laughing)"
01:08:28;01:08:29;"We don't have to rehearse."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"You know?"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"It's pure improv,"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"and we kind of get away with it,"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"because we're reasonably good at it."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"It can be really bad"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"if you don't know what you're doing."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"- Yeah, that's a great model."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"- Yeah, I mean, it's a terrifying thing to improvise"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"and actually hold an audience's attention,"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"but we've been able to pull it off."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"But, you know,"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"anybody who wants to can check it out."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"But it's a very timely question,"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"because now I'm playing with people"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"much younger than I am,"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"and I can talk about the dead,"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"and they all immediately go,"
01:08:56;01:09:00;"""Oh, yeah, you know, New Jersey, July 7th, 1974."""
01:09:00;01:09:01;"You know what I mean?"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"- Right."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- I'm like, ""What? Really?"""
01:09:03;01:09:05;"I mean, some of these people are really, really into it,"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"because all of it's up on the web now."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"- Right."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"But by contrast,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"kind of peak grunge era Seattle,"
01:09:12;01:09:15;"you kind of had to keep your dead fandom a little quiet."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"It just wasn't a fashionable--"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"nobody was interested in talking about it."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"- Oh, I'd get excoriated for it back there."
01:09:20;01:09:21;"Are you kidding?"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Well, there's a lot of uncool music"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"in everybody's record collection,"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"and I certainly had my share of it."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"- But it's, like, funny in a weird way."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"I guess this is always what happens."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"It's like a younger generation,"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"it's harder to understand the biases of a previous one,"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"'cause obviously the dead had so much music,"
01:09:36;01:09:39;"but every big grunge band, Nirvana included,"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"you could picture, like, a dead record"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"or an era that they'd probably be into."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"You know, like, why wouldn't Kurt be into, like,"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"live dead, you know,"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"like the late '60s stuff or something?"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"You know, it doesn't seem that different."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"You would think that as one of the--"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"such an iconic American band,"
01:09:56;01:09:59;"that they would have been a little more fashionable"
01:09:59;01:10:03;"with, like, this kind of back-to-basics era"
01:10:03;01:10:04;"of, like, rock music."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"- Well, listen, I don't think he lived long enough."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"I mean, look at--unplugged MTV, unplugged, okay?"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"And now look at, you know, ""American Beauty"""
01:10:11;01:10:13;"or ""A Working Man's Dead"" or something."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"I mean, it's about a song--"
01:10:15;01:10:16;"playing a song with a guitar."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"I mean, Dylan did that even."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"For that matter, the dead covered Dylan a few times."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"- Yeah. - So, you know,"
01:10:22;01:10:23;"it's not that big a stretch."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"He probably just was--"
01:10:24;01:10:25;"probably in a few more years,"
01:10:25;01:10:27;"he would have eventually discovered them"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"and thought, ""Oh, okay, this is actually pretty cool."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Now I get it."""
01:10:30;01:10:33;"- Well, maybe it was, like, a hippie thing."
01:10:33;01:10:34;"I have a sense that, like,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"the musicians of that era were, like,"
01:10:36;01:10:42;"super anti-hippie and super anti-Baby Boomer '60s"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"idealism or mythology."
01:10:45;01:10:46;"- Yeah, I think you're right."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Grunge was pretty nihilistic at the time."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"- Absolutely, and I think that's a good point"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"about Kurt specifically,"
01:10:52;01:10:56;"that, obviously, tragically dying so young."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"When you watch interviews with him,"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"he actually--even though he would occasionally"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"say some spicy stuff here and there,"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"from what I understand,"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"specifically about the dead,"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"he actually seemed, like, very open-minded."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"I watched an interview recently with him"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"where they asked him about Madonna."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"And it was kind of, like, a loaded question."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"The interviewer was saying, like,"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"""Hey, Kurt, did you hear that Madonna's"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"trying to sign grunge bands now"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"to her record label?"""
01:11:19;01:11:21;"'Cause I think they probably wanted him to say,"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"""Oh, my God, that's so f---ed up."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"That's so lame."
01:11:25;01:11:26;"What a--you know, what a--yeah."""
01:11:26;01:11:27;"- Yeah."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"- He was actually very thoughtful about it."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"He was like, ""Well, in her own way,"
01:11:30;01:11:34;"Madonna is a very, like, interesting artist,"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"and it doesn't surprise me"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"that she'd have her finger on the pulse."""
01:11:37;01:11:39;"He didn't totally give it up for her,"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"but he didn't take the bait"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"to, like, trash her."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"He was, like-- - Right."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"- And also, he was, like,"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"very familiar with her work."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"He was like, ""Well, you know,"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"you look at how she was, like,"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"influenced by voguing,"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"a gay subculture from New York."""
01:11:52;01:11:53;"And he's kind of, like--"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"you know, he just, like, knew about her career."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"So I could totally picture--"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"I think that's a good point, like,"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"look at the MTV Unplugged."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"You could totally see, you know,"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"a 30-something Kurt getting, like,"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"deep into American beauty"
01:12:07;01:12:08;"and, like, doing an interview"
01:12:08;01:12:09;"and be like, ""Yeah, I used to do"
01:12:09;01:12:11;"'Slam the Dead' a little bit"
01:12:11;01:12:12;"when I was kind of, like, young,"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"kind of, like, angry punk rocker,"
01:12:15;01:12:16;"but actually now I see the ways"
01:12:16;01:12:17;"in which the dead are kind of punk,"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"and they're--"""
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I can totally see that happening."
01:12:20;01:12:21;"- Yeah, and listen, you know,"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"one of Kurt's favorite bands"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"was Flipper,"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"and Flipper is a very, very noisy band,"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"and there is definitely an element"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"of chaos and looseness"
01:12:30;01:12:31;"and improvisation"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"embedded in most of their best songs."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"It's not their biggest stretch."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"- Mm. - The other thing"
01:12:36;01:12:37;"I'm gonna point out"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"that you should think about,"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"and that's the business model"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"of Pearl Jam."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"So Pearl Jam has maintained their own--"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"the control over their catalog."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"They've got their own mail order."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"They've got their fan club."
01:12:48;01:12:49;"You know, for a while--"
01:12:49;01:12:50;"and maybe they still do this."
01:12:50;01:12:51;"I don't know."
01:12:51;01:12:52;"They're not touring now, obviously,"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"but they were recording every show"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"and making it available--"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"recording multitrack available"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"for fans to buy."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"- Yeah."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"- Well, okay, think of Grateful Dead"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"and their entire--"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"the GDN, I mean,"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"the whole Grateful Dead merchandising,"
01:13:07;01:13:08;"the stuff from the vault"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"that they always sell,"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"I mean, all of the limited edition"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"live recordings that they make available."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Pearl Jam ended up--"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"I don't know if this was on purpose or not,"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"but they ended up sort of following"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"the Grateful Dead's business model"
01:13:22;01:13:26;"of giving the fans as much as they want"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"and not having to run all of it"
01:13:28;01:13:29;"through the major label pipeline,"
01:13:29;01:13:30;"if you will."

01:14:33;01:14:35;"this is the type of thing we talked about on the show a lot,"
01:14:35;01:14:36;"which is Starbucks."
01:14:36;01:14:40;"And in fact, one of our longtime friends of the show"
01:14:40;01:14:41;"invented Starbucking."
01:14:41;01:14:46;"He actually recently went to his 16,000th Starbucks."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"He's been trying to hit every Starbucks in the world"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"since the '90s."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"But so I'm just curious about,"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"you know, take us back to like '80s Seattle."
01:14:54;01:14:58;"How familiar were you with that like original Starbucks?"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Like before it exploded in the '90s,"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"were you hitting it?"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"- No, I, in fact, I just gave up coffee about a week ago."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"(laughs)"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"We'll see if it sticks. - A week ago?"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"- Yeah."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Now, you know what?"
01:15:10;01:15:12;"I didn't start drinking coffee until I was 50 years old."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"That's the funny thing."
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Coffee was not even on my radar."
01:15:15;01:15:19;"- Even with this whole like Seattle coffee thing,"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"you were there for like all those years"
01:15:21;01:15:24;"and you never started slamming brew,"
01:15:24;01:15:25;"(laughs)"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"coffee brews?"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"- I really didn't give a damn about coffee."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"I just did not drink coffee."
01:15:30;01:15:33;"But you know, there was that store down in Pioneer Square,"
01:15:33;01:15:34;"the original Starbucks store."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"I think it was there for quite a long time."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"I could be wrong."
01:15:38;01:15:40;"- Yeah, maybe since the '70s?"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"- I mean, it was there in the '70s."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"And when did they suddenly become"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"a giant global mega corporation?"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"I mean, it didn't happen overnight."
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- Right, '90s."
01:15:49;01:15:52;"- You know, I mean, there may have been quite a few years"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"when that was the only store."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"I don't actually know the history of it,"
01:15:54;01:15:58;"but I'm not sure exactly when the coffee thing took off."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"I mean, now there's, you know,"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"Seattle is like wildly over-served with coffee shops"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"and not just Starbucks."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"I don't know."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"I can't really speak to the Starbucks thing really."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"You know, there seemed to be more of a beer and pot tune"
01:16:11;01:16:13;"to me during the grunge years."
01:16:13;01:16:14;"- Interesting."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"- Can I ask, just to end with a sort of a Herm Yall question,"
01:16:17;01:16:22;"wondering if Jake, who has created this proto-Herm Yall"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"playlist of bands that may lean in,"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"was there anyone that you wanted to sort of check"
01:16:26;01:16:30;"with the master here or anyone you maybe were on the fence with?"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"- Oh, yeah, that's a great question."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"- Read it down to me and let me see if I,"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"I may not have heard all of it, so."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"- Okay, well, I mean."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"- Now keep in mind, this is Herm Yall origins."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"- Yeah."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"- So it's all pre-grunge."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"- It's all music that came out before 10."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"- Oh, okay. Interesting."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"- Ooh."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"- I kind of expanded the parameters a little bit."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"I have Green River by Credence Clearwater Revival on there."
01:16:50;01:16:51;"- Ooh."
01:16:51;01:16:55;"- Yeah, take me down, down, where the river."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"- Well, maybe, maybe, sure."
01:16:57;01:17:01;"- I got Something in the Night by Bruce Springsteen."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"- I don't know that one."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"- Hand Me Down World by the Guess Who."
01:17:04;01:17:07;"- Yeah, Burton Cummings for sure."
01:17:07;01:17:10;"- I have Bargain by the Who."
01:17:10;01:17:13;"I think Daltrey has a lot of, if he wants."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"I mean, Daltrey can be really free."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"- Call that a bargain, yep."
01:17:16;01:17:19;"He's got a little of that twang sometimes in his voice."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"- I'm gonna take it, listen, we can."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"- I call you a bargain, the best band ever."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"- We can bond over this."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"I'm a huge Who fan, okay?"
01:17:25;01:17:26;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:17:26;01:17:29;"- And it's funny, I know people who are both dead fans"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"and Who fans, I'm not sure what the connection is,"
01:17:31;01:17:32;"but it is what it is."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"- Well, you're talking to one."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"- I love the Who."
01:17:35;01:17:37;"- I got L.A. Woman by the Doors."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"- Oh, an interesting thought."
01:17:40;01:17:43;"I wouldn't call it yarling, but he's definitely"
01:17:43;01:17:46;"in that sort of a hammy kind of mid-range register there."
01:17:46;01:17:49;"So yeah, maybe so, okay, a progenitor, sure."
01:17:49;01:17:53;"- I got Easy Wind sung by Pigpen of the Grateful Dead."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"♪ Easy wind ♪"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"- Oh yeah, yeah, good one, that's a good one."
01:17:58;01:17:59;"You got me on that."
01:17:59;01:18:00;"- Nice."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"- That's a good choice."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- Hell yeah."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"- No, I know that song, that is a good choice."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"I take my hat off to you there."
01:18:05;01:18:08;"- And then I got one that I put it out on Twitter today"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"and someone suggested this, and I thought"
01:18:10;01:18:13;"it was an interesting call, which would be"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"Injustice for All era Metallica."
01:18:16;01:18:17;"I put on one."
01:18:17;01:18:20;"I think he's got his own thing, we need to come up"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"with a different name for what he was doing"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"because I think he's got his own version of the yarl."
01:18:25;01:18:29;"It deserves its own name, so start thinking of one."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"- Yeah, no, I think that's--"
01:18:30;01:18:33;"- You know, that kind of thing where he did, yeah."
01:18:33;01:18:34;"You know, that--"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"- Yep."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"- Where the words ended like this."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"- Yeah."
01:18:39;01:18:43;"- You know, not exactly yarling, but it's something."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"- Right, it's like a cousin."
01:18:45;01:18:48;"- Yeah, it's a cousin, let's call it a cousin."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Let's call it a cousin, you know."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"- The last one I have, I think it's really kind of"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"the granddaddy of it all is"

01:19:09;01:19:11;"- Well, I'm glad you're signing up."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"And then you know what?"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"I put down on the last, right at the end of the playlist"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"something that was contemporary yarl."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"And I think it's my favorite moment of yarl."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"I put down ""Hunger Strike."""
01:19:22;01:19:24;"- Okay, listen, we gotta be nice to Eddie here."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"And I'll tell you why, because that was like"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"the first thing he, that was before"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"the first Pearl Jam record, okay?"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"It might have got released later."
01:19:30;01:19:32;"- I'm not saying this as a negative."
01:19:32;01:19:35;"I think all the music I've listed,"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"I like to varying degrees."
01:19:37;01:19:38;"- Oh, you know what, and actually--"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- I like the great song."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"- Sorry, and I love ""Hunger Strike."""
01:19:40;01:19:41;"- Sorry, Jackie, Jackie."
01:19:41;01:19:42;"- It's beautiful."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"- My last question is,"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"whatever the origins of the yarl are,"
01:19:46;01:19:49;"my personal belief is that"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"the vast majority of these post-yarl bands"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"that you were talking about, the 2000s,"
01:19:55;01:20:00;"they were directly, to me, copying Eddie in particular."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Is that fair to say, or were they trying,"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"you know what I mean?"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"- Eddie and Lane."
01:20:04;01:20:06;"Okay, Lane didn't yarl that much,"
01:20:06;01:20:07;"but they definitely, a lot of people"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"were influenced by the two of those guys,"

01:20:42;01:20:45;"and those appeared on the air,"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"and we had to sort of listen"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"to these exaggerated caricatures of the original bands."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"That was what it felt like in the later '90s to me."

01:22:43;01:22:47;"but you wanted to do a presentation on the presidents of the United States of America."
01:22:47;01:22:51;"What inspired it? Was it because we have a new president?"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"Yeah. You know, I'll say that I think about this band maybe about once a year,"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"and they popped into my head, I think,"
01:22:57;01:23:01;"during all this talk of transition to power and the new president."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"And I just texted the thread, and I said,"

01:23:14;01:23:16;"And I can't remember, but I remember I was like,"
01:23:16;01:23:19;"""Oh, well, they were the first compact disc that I'd ever owned,"""
01:23:19;01:23:25;"because 1995, I felt like, or '96 maybe, was really their year."
01:23:25;01:23:29;"And it felt like an interesting band to talk about."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"And then I started looking into them a little bit,"
01:23:31;01:23:36;"and I remember at the time that they were this sort of very funny, irreverent band."
01:23:36;01:23:42;"Jake had referenced that the lead singer had this male-patterned baldness look going on,"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"which was unique."
01:23:44;01:23:49;"But as I was just telling you guys, kind of off-mic,"
01:23:49;01:23:53;"I realized why they sort of have become like a rock footnote,"
01:23:53;01:23:56;"because there isn't really, looking into their bio,"
01:23:56;01:24:01;"as weird as their name was and how irreverent their singles at the time seemed,"
01:24:01;01:24:05;"there isn't really anything especially interesting about them."
01:24:05;01:24:10;"So I talked about, ""Oh, maybe we want to listen to Peaches,"" one of their hits."

01:24:12;01:24:16;"They should play a presidential inauguration sometime."
01:24:16;01:24:17;"- Well, actually-- - They're totally right."
01:24:17;01:24:21;"So I will say that they actually have weirdly been politically active."
01:24:21;01:24:26;"They played at a DNC fundraiser for Clinton in '94."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"They performed for John Kerry in 2004."
01:24:29;01:24:30;"Okay."
01:24:30;01:24:35;"And they did a song about Barack Obama that was released in 2009."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Whoa."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"I think it's sort of like--what do you call it?"
01:24:38;01:24:44;"Nomenclative dissonance when a name determines a certain entity's course in life?"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"Oh, I mean, that almost sounds like the opposite of dissonance."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"- Consonance. Yeah. - Consonance."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"- Nomenclative consonance. - Well, yeah, no."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"I've heard people say stuff like that."
01:24:53;01:24:58;"Like, there's a disproportionate number of dudes named Dennis who become dentists."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- Have you heard that? - Whoa."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"I've never heard that. Wow."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"That sounds like the exact type of fact that you could probably--"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"is like maybe just statistical noise."

01:25:09;01:25:11;"I haven't heard it in literally decades."
01:25:11;01:25:15;"- Is this Peaches? - Is this Peaches?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"I mean, the big one I think was Lump."
01:25:17;01:25:22;"Well, Lump and Peaches were both massive, so it's like--"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"Yeah."
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Nobody could call them a one-hit wonder."
01:25:25;01:25:36;"This is the type of song that I would get so hyped when this would come on the Alt-Rock radio station."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"Totally. Yeah."
01:25:38;01:25:42;"So it's like, I never owned this CD, but I would call myself a fan."
01:25:42;01:25:53;"Sort of a Ween vibe."
01:25:53;01:25:55;"Definitely."
01:25:55;01:25:57;"Oh, yeah, totally. Sort of."
01:25:57;01:26:05;"I feel like this song, it sort of like suggests that there's a deeper meaning to it,"
01:26:05;01:26:10;"but it also is probably just literally about what it's about."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"You know, like it seems like a metaphor, but it's not."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Yeah, exactly. Yeah."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"We got to do a deep dive on this."
01:26:17;01:26:18;"That's such a funny call."
01:26:18;01:26:21;"It seems like there's a metaphor, but there's not."

01:27:13;01:27:18;"According to Wikipedia, the singer Chris Ballew"
01:27:18;01:27:21;"stated that he wrote ""Peaches"" about a girl he once had a crush on,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"which would almost make you think that it's a metaphor,"
01:27:23;01:27:26;"but then he follows that by saying that he wrote it"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"while sitting under a peach tree that was in her yard."
01:27:29;01:27:33;"So it's actually just about the peaches, not the girl."
01:27:33;01:27:36;"I feel like I remember hearing something about this band where"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"they only had five strings, where like"
01:27:39;01:27:43;"the bass player just had the low two strings strung."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Yes."
01:27:44;01:27:47;"And then the guitar player only played power chords on the top"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"or the bottom three strings."
01:27:49;01:27:53;"I remember 'cause they were called their instruments by funny names"
01:27:53;01:27:57;"like the Bassitar and the..."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"I don't know what the other thing would be called."
01:27:59;01:28:02;"Yeah, musically they keep everything very minimal."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"They only have five strings between bassists,"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"Chris Ballew and guitarist Dave Detterer,"
01:28:07;01:28:09;"between the two of them."
01:28:09;01:28:12;"So the bass has two strings and the guitar has three strings?"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"The synopsis does not go into those details, but I..."
01:28:14;01:28:16;"I'm assuming."
01:28:16;01:28:19;"Bass has four strings, guitar has one string."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"[laughs]"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"I'm on some sort of like forum now."
01:28:23;01:28:26;"Yeah, Ballew's instrument has two bass strings."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Okay, so it's two and three."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Two and three."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"That's tight."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"It's funny, I never owned that CD."
01:28:32;01:28:36;"I've never gone deep, but I always just felt like"
01:28:36;01:28:38;"I was really hyped about that song."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"I liked Lump too."
01:28:40;01:28:45;"And I just always like, you know those bands that you never become an official fan of,"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"but you just kind of like tip of the hat to?"
01:28:48;01:28:52;"And so in a sense, I was just like a real adjacent fan."
01:28:52;01:28:56;"I was really glad that they were around, and I was always into them."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"I wonder what they're up to these days."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"It looks like they've been releasing records through the 2000s."
01:29:01;01:29:05;"I wonder if they were respected by their fellow Seattle."
01:29:05;01:29:09;"Because, you know, like Wikipedia says that they're a grunge band."
01:29:09;01:29:13;"They're grunge, punk rock, pop, punk, alternative rock."
01:29:13;01:29:20;"Seems like their sense of humor may be sort of like relegated to novelty band territory or something."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"Well, they're like right on the edge."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"I was getting like a They Might Be Giants vibe a little bit."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"Or Nixit being--"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"Oh yeah, I can see that."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"Not grunge, not a grunge band."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"No, just a 90s rock band."
01:29:33;01:29:37;"Although it says Kim Thayil of Soundgarden played on the record."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"Oh really? That's tough."
01:29:39;01:29:43;"I also wonder too--this makes me want to go deeper on their discography."
01:29:43;01:29:47;"I wonder if there's like--the name is so long."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"It is such a mouthful."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Do people call them PUSA?"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"I've seen that acronym."
01:29:53;01:29:57;"I wonder if there's like some PUSA heads who are also like, you know,"
01:29:57;01:30:00;"if they heard somebody being like, ""Yeah, you know, kind of like a sense of humor."""
01:30:00;01:30:04;"They'd be like, ""Oh my God, all you've heard is lump and peaches."
01:30:04;01:30:07;"Get into some of the later albums."""
01:30:07;01:30:09;"I wonder if that's the case."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"There's a deep cut on that album called We're Not Gonna Make It"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"that was very self-deprecating."
01:30:14;01:30:18;"I remember that it was like--it was all about how they weren't talented at all."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"I remember that as like a 13-year-old being like,"
01:30:21;01:30:24;"""Oh, these guys are really kicking the b---s out of themselves."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"This is awesome."""
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Okay, they did have a good sense of humor."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"You know, it's funny, although I want to say something about peaches."
01:30:31;01:30:34;"I don't know if the guys in the band would feel this way."
01:30:34;01:30:38;"But I guess I always thought that the commentary in that song"
01:30:38;01:30:43;"was kind of just like--there's that kind of like mellow A section."
01:30:43;01:30:47;"♪ Moving to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches. ♪"
01:30:47;01:30:49;"Which is kind of his fantasy."
01:30:49;01:30:53;"He's gonna get away from the Seattle rat race, go just like chill."
01:30:53;01:30:57;"A lot of people have these fantasies, especially now in the COVID era."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"People want to leave the dense urban centers,"

01:31:04;01:31:06;"I'm gonna eat fresh peaches, all this stuff."""
01:31:06;01:31:10;"But then the distortion comes in for the B section."

01:31:19;01:31:24;"I mean, that right there at least is setting up a dichotomy"
01:31:24;01:31:29;"where it's like his dream, his pastoral dream of eating country peaches"
01:31:29;01:31:35;"is punctured by the knowledge that actually in today's hyper-connected"
01:31:35;01:31:39;"capitalist world, probably you go try to buy your peach out there in the country"

01:31:43;01:31:46;"in a man in a factory downtown back in the city."
01:31:46;01:31:50;"So I almost felt like part of the song is like kind of alternating"

01:31:53;01:31:55;"""No, man, you're never gonna escape downtown."""

01:32:14;01:32:17;"Peaches are so cheap that they might as well be free maybe."
01:32:17;01:32:21;"I mean, maybe it's a comment on like, you know,"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"like the peach is the creation of God's bounty"

01:33:15;01:33:18;"You're not far off, Ezra."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Is there anyone you'd concentrate?"
01:33:20;01:33:24;"You want to read what Matt sent us?"
01:33:24;01:33:28;"Well, yeah, but I think Matt is disproving."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"What did Matt send us?"
01:33:30;01:33:33;"So this is from 2013. This is a conversation between the band."
01:33:33;01:33:37;"Not quite sure who's speaking, but this is from the band's point of view."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"I imagine this part is that they're talking to Chris."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"""I picture this front yard and I picture you being otherwise influenced by"
01:33:42;01:33:44;"like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
01:33:44;01:33:48;"For peaches, if you Google Marxist interpretation of peaches,"
01:33:48;01:33:51;"up pops this treatise and somebody has--"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"this has been in the internet for years and years."
01:33:53;01:33:56;"It's full of explanations how peaches is an accurate metaphor for socialism."
01:33:56;01:33:59;"Meanwhile, it's a dude that's kind of wasted."
01:33:59;01:34:02;"I don't want to tell people what kind of things to think about,"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"but their version is usually way better than my version."""
01:34:05;01:34:07;"So that basically is the Geisenpuster thing like,"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"""Hey, we've seen these Marxist interpretations."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"That's way more interesting than what we have to say."""
01:34:13;01:34:16;"But it sounds like he's tacitly-- he's not knocking it."
01:34:16;01:34:17;"I think he's cosigning it."
01:34:17;01:34:19;"Peaches is a Marxist anthem."
01:34:19;01:34:23;"A lot of members of the DSA, way before Bernie's presidential run,"
01:34:23;01:34:28;"they actually point to the ubiquitous peaches on '90s rock radio"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"as their moment of radicalization."
01:34:30;01:34:34;"Incidentally, this band did endorse Bernie in 2016."
01:34:34;01:34:35;"They did?"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Yeah, that's on their Wikipedia."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"I knew I f***ed with Pusa."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"[laughs]"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Interesting."
01:34:43;01:34:46;"[laughs]"
01:34:46;01:34:49;"Wait, but Seinfeld, do you remember back in the day?"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"So you were pretty psyched."
01:34:51;01:34:52;"You got their first album."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"It has multiple big hits."
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Did you buy the follow-up?"
01:34:56;01:34:57;"No."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"Wow."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"I did not stick around for the--"
01:34:59;01:35:00;"Actually, you know what?"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Now I'm looking at the cover of the follow-up,"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"I remember-- [laughs]"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"I remember, you remember, like, in CD stores,"
01:35:06;01:35:07;"there would be, like, a listening station"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"where you could, like, use, like, the discussion headphones"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"that, like, everybody's used."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"I remember checking it out and just being like,"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"""Nah, I'm not gonna get it."""
01:35:16;01:35:18;"I guess when you're, like, 12 or 13,"
01:35:18;01:35:21;"it's like you're trying out different stuff."
01:35:21;01:35:24;"You're not gonna have that kind of loyalty"
01:35:24;01:35:27;"that us music industry professionals hope,"
01:35:27;01:35:30;"you know, one might have."
01:35:30;01:35:34;"Well, it was a more mature, wise 15-year-old Seinfeld."
01:35:34;01:35:37;"Well, you know, it was also that time, like, pre-iPod"
01:35:37;01:35:40;"when you really had to choose your genre, right?"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"And so I remember it was, like, after this,"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"it was, like, Wu-Tang, and then I was just, like--"
01:35:44;01:35:48;"It was just, like, strictly rap for, like, years after that."
01:35:48;01:35:51;"So you're right, I think I was, like, trying to find my thing,"
01:35:51;01:35:54;"but at that point, it didn't really gel"
01:35:54;01:35:57;"with, like, my own personal music brand,"
01:35:57;01:35:59;"you know what I mean?"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"Before you could just listen to anything."
01:36:01;01:36:03;"That's fair, and I bet, though, it's like,"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"you know, we're pretty close in age,"
01:36:05;01:36:08;"and I bet there's a lot of people who were, like,"
01:36:08;01:36:13;"had that album/were just kind of fans of Peaches & Lump,"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"who probably went on to do, like,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"take that kind of irreverence,"
01:36:17;01:36:21;"whether into the social media sphere,"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"arts, politics, you know?"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Because that first album was just, like,"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"so much bigger than the subsequent ones."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I'm sure they have, like, ride-or-die fans,"
01:36:29;01:36:33;"but, like, I do think because that album was so big,"
01:36:33;01:36:35;"people can kind of, like,"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"like you said, you think about them once a year,"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"and then you remember, like, ""Oh, my God,"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"those songs are massive. That was, like, a cool band."""
01:36:41;01:36:43;"But I bet there's, like, a lot of people out there"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"who really connected with"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Presidents of the United States of America"
01:36:47;01:36:50;"at a formative age, and maybe didn't think about them"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"afterwards, they moved on to Wu-Tang,"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"but I bet there's a few people listening right now"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"who are just like, ""Oh, f***, man."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Yeah, actually, Lump and Peaches, I never thought about"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"how much those songs meant to me."""
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Shout-out to Presidents of the United States of America."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"It's time for the Top 5"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Five"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"on iTunes."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"So this week on the Top 5,"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"we're gonna just do"
01:37:12;01:37:15;"the Top 5 songs on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"this week in '95."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Why '95, Seinfeld?"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"Because the year that"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"Presidents of the United States of America's debut"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"album,"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"Presidents of the United States of America, came out."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"Absolutely."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"I love how '90s TC has been lately."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"[laughs]"
01:37:33;01:37:36;"The last episode of 2020,"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"the Jake vs. Rashida"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Gen X showdown."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"Oh, yeah."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"We're just keeping the '90s love going strong."
01:37:44;01:37:47;"So this week, we're just gonna do the Alternative Songs list."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"It was interesting on the last episode"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"because I think we all found that"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"the '92 Alternative chart"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"hadn't crossed over into grunge land yet."
01:37:55;01:37:57;"Number one was Peter Gabriel."
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Right."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"And I think the song that we're gonna do"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"is the one that we're gonna do"
01:38:03;01:38:05;"in '95."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"I imagine by then, we'll be a little more familiar."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"Although, I look at the number five song"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"and I'm already kind of surprised."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"Number five is"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"The Stone Roses"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"with Love Spreads."
01:38:19;01:38:21;"Stone Roses, famously,"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"not that big in the US."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"Right. I'm surprised this is"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"on there."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"I mean, damn, talk about '70s."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"Yeah."
01:38:45;01:38:47;"I mean, Jake, how familiar are you"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"with The Stone Roses period?"
01:38:49;01:38:51;"Not very. I know their song,"
01:38:51;01:38:53;"""I Wanna Be Adored."""
01:38:53;01:38:55;"You know that song? Yeah, that's a good song."
01:38:55;01:38:57;"It's on the first album. I love that song."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"This is kind of like"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"Exile Main Street meets"
01:39:03;01:39:05;"Physical Graffiti or something."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"Yeah, we're no vocals."
01:39:07;01:39:09;"This is like we're waiting"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"for a baseball player"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"to come out and"
01:39:13;01:39:15;"it's like, ""Uh."""
01:39:15;01:39:17;"Johnny, you're a bat."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Johnny's in the dugout. Let it cook."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"Let it cook."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Oh, vocals come in late."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"Even the vocals come in."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"The confused announcers are just like,"
01:39:31;01:39:33;"""No sign of Johnny Damon."""
01:39:33;01:39:35;"Uh."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Little bit chaotic scene on the field right now."
01:39:37;01:39:39;"Johnny's in the clubhouse."
01:39:39;01:39:41;"He's on the john."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"[laughter]"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"The Red Sox"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"forfeit a run."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Highly unusual."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"[laughter]"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"I guess they're going to pinch"
01:39:53;01:39:55;"it for Johnny Damon, but Johnny Damon's out of the game."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"[laughter]"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"I don't know the Stone Roses' second album that well."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"Like I was saying,"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"they're famously"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"or not very well known in the US,"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"but a deeply"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"beloved, big, influential band"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"in the UK. Late in life,"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"I got into their first album,"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"which rules."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"I Want to Be Adored, Waterfall."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Then they had a single"
01:40:21;01:40:23;"called Fool's Gold."
01:40:23;01:40:25;"That was their baggy,"
01:40:25;01:40:27;"funky song."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Their first album is, no pun intended,"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"a Stone Cold classic."
01:40:31;01:40:33;"That just doesn't really sound much like"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"1995"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"alt radio as I remember it."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"Doesn't that last one feel"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"kind of adjacent to Black Crows, though?"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"I mean, I feel like"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"there's a popular sound"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"at this time that's not"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"as far off from as it may seem."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Although, you really got to think about"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"Black Crows were huge in like 1990."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"By '95,"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"they were"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"not..."
01:40:59;01:41:01;"I'm sure they were still big, but just like..."
01:41:01;01:41:03;"They were an anomaly, for sure,"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"in terms of contemporary bands"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"that were huge."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"My dad liked the Black Crows,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"but he did not like Nirvana"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"and Soundgarden."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"They kind of stuck out"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"and they were kind of retro vibe."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Yeah, they were kind of on their own path."
01:41:19;01:41:21;"Okay, the number"
01:41:21;01:41:23;"four song."
01:41:23;01:41:25;"Now we're getting into very familiar territory."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"A little bit of Connecticut territory."
01:41:27;01:41:29;"Number four,"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"Weezer, Buddy Holly."
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Connecticut native, Rivers Cuomo."
01:41:33;01:41:37;"Love that guitar tone."
01:41:37;01:41:43;"Just that"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Chinese power chord distortion."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Heavy."
01:41:47;01:41:57;"I mean,"
01:41:57;01:41:59;"this is just an incredible album."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"Truly one of the greats of the decade."
01:42:01;01:42:05;"Did I ever tell you guys"
01:42:05;01:42:07;"that for my brother's"
01:42:07;01:42:09;"bar mitzvah, my mom went"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"to the Wiz and they were having a"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"sort of a surplus sale"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"on the maxi single for"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Sweater Song."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"And my mom just bought a hundred"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"of them. And those were the"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"giveaways for the limbo"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"at my brother's bar mitzvah."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"They were just trying to offload a crate"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"of CD singles."
01:42:29;01:42:31;"The maxi singles, tape singles"
01:42:31;01:42:33;"of the Sweater Song."
01:42:33;01:42:35;"Oh, the cassette single."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"The cassette single of Sweater Song."
01:42:37;01:42:39;"That was the big giveaway."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"The cassette single."
01:42:45;01:42:49;"♪Oop-oop, in the notes of mine♪"
01:42:49;01:42:53;"♪Oop-oop, the dance floor is mine♪"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"♪When it's free ooh-wa-doo♪"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"♪Dressed like money, honey♪"
01:42:57;01:43:01;"♪Oh-oh, and we're married, darling boy♪"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"♪I don't care what they say about us♪"
01:43:04;01:43:09;"♪Cause we, I don't care about that♪"
01:43:09;01:43:13;"♪I don't care about that♪"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"♪When it's free, no, no, no♪"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"♪Never been so down, oh, oh, oh♪"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"♪What a fool, don't joke now♪"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"♪But last night's show, I came running♪"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"Oh, I love this transition coming up into the guitar solo."
01:43:24;01:43:25;"Oh yeah."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"♪I was scared, I was scared, I was scared♪"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"♪What's the matter, baby, why are you leaving me?♪"
01:43:29;01:43:34;"♪Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh♪"
01:43:34;01:43:39;"♪Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo♪"
01:43:39;01:43:43;"Weezer Blue Album, Stone Cold Classic."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"You know, it's funny, Weezer's another band"
01:43:44;01:43:47;"where it's like, I never actually bought the Blue Album,"
01:43:47;01:43:51;"but I just was like, so many people I knew had it."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"I was just always very excited to see the video for this."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"And I was just always kind of like."
01:43:55;01:43:57;"- I like the quirky bands."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Did you buy Pinkerton?"
01:43:59;01:44:00;"- I didn't buy Pinkerton,"
01:44:00;01:44:05;"but I taped a late night radio show"
01:44:05;01:44:10;"off K-Rock in New York that had El Scorcho on it."
01:44:10;01:44:14;"So I wasn't totally checked into the critical discourse"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"around music yet."
01:44:15;01:44:17;"So it was only later that I found out that"
01:44:17;01:44:22;"Pinkerton had this weird arc of being a flop"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"and bad reviews and people hating on it"
01:44:24;01:44:25;"that it became this classic."
01:44:25;01:44:28;"'Cause I just kind of remember being like, El Scorcho,"
01:44:28;01:44:31;"that's like a sick Weezer song."
01:44:31;01:44:34;"And also the idea that you kind of read"
01:44:34;01:44:35;"in the discourse around Pinkerton,"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"which is like, yo, that album was so dark and weird."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"It alienated the critics, it alienated the fans."
01:44:41;01:44:44;"And I can see that in certain lyrics in retrospect."
01:44:44;01:44:45;"I know what they're talking about."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"But I just remember when I first encountered that narrative,"
01:44:47;01:44:50;"I was just like picturing myself jamming this cassette"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"of like a radio rip of El Scorcho."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"And I was like, what?"
01:44:54;01:44:57;"Just like, El Scorcho."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"Just picturing somebody hearing El Scorcho"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"and just being like, yo,"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Rivers is in a really dark place, man."
01:45:03;01:45:04;"(laughing)"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"You know, like, I don't know."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"- That's the goofiest song on the record,"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"but that's hilarious."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"- I know, but it was the lead single, as I recall."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- That's really funny."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"- And then just the other songs."
01:45:15;01:45:18;"♪ I don't wanna be an old man anymore ♪"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"That's like super blue album."
01:45:20;01:45:23;"I also think a big part of it was the album cover."
01:45:23;01:45:26;"That like, you know, Japanese woodblock,"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"very black print, snow falling, kind of dark."
01:45:29;01:45:33;"I feel like, 'cause you know, in all the press you read,"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Rivers is very like, kind of traumatized"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"by the reception of that album."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"So you can imagine that he was like,"
01:45:39;01:45:40;"first album's a blue album,"
01:45:40;01:45:43;"then they do this kind of like weird, dark,"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"vibey image on the cover."
01:45:45;01:45:49;"And then he was like, you know, back to colors, green."
01:45:49;01:45:52;"And I truly wondered, I wish I had a time machine."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"If Pinkerton was just called the green album,"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"and it was just like another picture of the band"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"with a green background,"
01:45:58;01:46:01;"would the reception have been different at the time?"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"I say yes."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"- Yeah, I feel that."

01:47:05;01:47:08;"on this show, partially because I feel like"

01:47:37;01:47:40;"I'm not a completist, but I'm a fan,"

01:48:19;01:48:21;"more or less front to back."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"And yeah, going back to like ""Murmur"" and stuff,"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"it is kind of like fascinating to hear that like real,"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"like already indie (beep)"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"and then be like, it's the same band"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"that just wrote these like massive"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"everybody hurts type songs."
01:48:35;01:48:37;"- I mean, to me, it's not that different."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Like they didn't, they would change their sound"
01:48:39;01:48:42;"from record to record, but it always felt organic"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"and like very unforced."
01:48:44;01:48:47;"Like there's songs on ""Murmur"" that I think"
01:48:47;01:48:50;"are as beautiful as like everybody hurts."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"They maybe don't have the like,"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"the string section or whatever, but."
01:48:53;01:48:56;"- Right, maybe I'm just even thinking about the lyrics."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"It's like, - Oh, sure, sure."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"- Stipe is a legend, he's a real cool lyricist."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"And like, you know, just the fact that it's like,"
01:49:02;01:49:05;"you know, like they had a song called like ""Moral Kiosk."""
01:49:05;01:49:06;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:49:06;01:49:08;"- That sounds like the fall or something,"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"like real artsy weirdo (beep)"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"- Sounds like a pavement, right."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"- Is he kind of like the originator"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"of a certain type of like that GBV?"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"- I think so, I know Stipe was a huge influence"
01:49:18;01:49:21;"on Pollard and Malcolmist, no doubt."
01:49:21;01:49:24;"- And I guess before him, I could think of like,"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"yeah, maybe some like weird English (beep)"
01:49:26;01:49:29;"like, I don't know if there was like a wire song"
01:49:29;01:49:32;"called ""Moral Kiosk,"" I could kind of see it."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"But anyway, to go from ""Moral Kiosk"" to ""Everybody Hurts,"""
01:49:34;01:49:36;"that's a cool arc."
01:49:36;01:49:40;"- Yeah, you know, it's funny, REM was,"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"I was just mentioning the Black Crows,"
01:49:41;01:49:44;"like how like my dad liked the Black Crows."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"REM was another band,"
01:49:45;01:49:50;"in terms of like bands that were contemporary in the 90s."
01:49:50;01:49:52;"That was the other band that my dad liked"
01:49:52;01:49:53;"and would like listen to."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"- Interesting, you think he got in through like,"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"losing my religion? - Like radio."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"Yeah, I remember he loved losing my religion."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"I remember like a few years ago,"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"he picked me up from the airport"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"and it was just like automatic for the people"
01:50:05;01:50:07;"playing in like the Tesla."
01:50:07;01:50:11;"I was like, tight choice, Dad."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"- The number two song."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"All right, so we now, ""Stone Rose"" is a little surprising,"
01:50:16;01:50:20;"but now we're just got like nothing but the big 90s names,"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"at least from the US point of view."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"Weezer REM, number two, how fitting."
01:50:25;01:50:27;"Pearl Jam with ""Better Man."""
01:50:27;01:50:30;"- Good song."
01:50:30;01:50:33;"- ""Better Man"" was never released as a proper single,"
01:50:33;01:50:35;"but topped the mainstream rock charts for eight weeks"
01:50:35;01:50:38;"and peaked at number two on the alternative Airplay chart."
01:50:38;01:50:39;"- Whoa."
01:50:39;01:50:42;"- Says Eddie Vedder wrote ""Better Man"" in high school"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"and based the melody loosely"

01:50:46;01:50:47;"Oh yeah, I think that's a thing they do live."
01:50:47;01:50:51;"They go into ""Save It For Later,"" which is a song I love."
01:50:52;01:50:52;"- Mm-hmm."
01:50:52;01:50:59;"Interesting he wrote this in high school, wow."
01:50:59;01:51:00;"Like busted it out."

01:55:35;01:55:38;"So that was number two, Pearl Jam."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"I haven't looked yet."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"Have you seen it yet, Jake, what number one is?"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"- No, I don't know what it is."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"- I mean, let's see, 95."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"- Are we gonna guess?"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"- Well--"
01:55:46;01:55:47;"- I'm gonna guess."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"- Yeah, what's your guess?"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"- Bush, Glycerine."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"♪ Glycerine ♪"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"- I don't know what year that album came out,"
01:55:55;01:55:57;"but I feel like that's more like '96"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"and that would have been top of the charts."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"- We're in January of '95."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"- Yeah, January '95."
01:56:03;01:56:05;"- Hmm, so something that came out in '94."
01:56:05;01:56:07;"- Stone Temple Pilots?"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"- Or like maybe The Offspring?"
01:56:09;01:56:10;"- Oh yeah, that's a great guess."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"It could definitely be The Offspring"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"'cause that album came out in '94."
01:56:13;01:56:16;"All right, let's find out the number one song this week."
01:56:16;01:56:18;"- Or something off Dookie."

01:59:05;01:59:07;"- Yeah, a little Herm there."
01:59:07;01:59:10;"- I'm sure I've said it on the show before,"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"this band loomed large for me,"
01:59:12;01:59:16;"as you can imagine being in middle school, mid 90s."
01:59:16;01:59:19;"Luckily, it's like, it's funny,"
01:59:19;01:59:22;"like I have heard stories about people who like,"
01:59:22;01:59:24;"some pop cultural thing came out"
01:59:24;01:59:26;"that had to do with their name,"
01:59:26;01:59:29;"and it made like, life hell for a while."
01:59:29;01:59:31;"- What's a good example of that?"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"- Well, actually I have to give them a funny one"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"that I just remember Ariel, friend of the show,"
01:59:36;01:59:40;"telling me that he had a memory of being on a school trip"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"(laughs)"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"when he, I don't know how old he would have been,"
01:59:43;01:59:46;"but he's a little kid, and he went on a school trip,"
01:59:46;01:59:48;"and they were going to see a movie,"
01:59:48;01:59:53;"and one of the previews before the movie"
01:59:53;01:59:57;"was a new, really big Disney animated film"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"called ""The Little Mermaid."""
01:59:59;02:00:01;"He's told this story in a very funny way before,"
02:00:01;02:00:02;"that he's just kind of sitting there like,"
02:00:02;02:00:03;"""Oh, a new Disney movie, tight,"""
02:00:03;02:00:05;"and all the kids are excited 'cause it's a cartoon,"
02:00:05;02:00:09;"and then it's just like, ""Introducing Ariel!"""
02:00:09;02:00:12;"And just like, him having this name"
02:00:12;02:00:13;"that maybe at the time not a lot of people knew,"
02:00:13;02:00:16;"and then it's like, this mermaid,"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"female mermaid with red hair,"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"he just had this feeling, like being in the theater,"
02:00:20;02:00:21;"like everybody's starting to look at him,"
02:00:21;02:00:24;"and he described his stomach dropping,"
02:00:24;02:00:28;"he's like, ""Oh, (beep) this is not good."""
02:00:28;02:00:30;"But the truth is, for ""Better Than Ezra,"""
02:00:30;02:00:32;"on the one hand, it sounds kind of bad,"
02:00:32;02:00:33;"and actually it's funny,"
02:00:33;02:00:35;"I feel like people have made this joke before,"
02:00:35;02:00:39;"that there's also this ska-punk band, Less Than Jake."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"So weirdly, our show, there's somebody out there"
02:00:41;02:00:44;"who's less than Jake, but better than Ezra,"
02:00:44;02:00:47;"and they can one day be the third host of this show."
02:00:47;02:00:50;"But there's something, so on the one hand,"
02:00:50;02:00:52;"""Better Than Ezra"" kind of sounds like,"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"""Oh, (beep) that could be like a Little Mermaid"
02:00:54;02:00:55;"or Karen moment."""
02:00:55;02:00:59;"And yet, in practice, there's kind of like,"
02:00:59;02:01:03;"not that much that people could do with it."
02:01:03;02:01:03;"You know what I mean? - No."
02:01:03;02:01:06;"- I just feel like there'd just be kids who'd just be like,"
02:01:06;02:01:08;"""Hey, I'm better than Ezra."""
02:01:08;02:01:11;"And I'd just be like, ""You're the band?"""
02:01:11;02:01:13;"And they'd just be like, ""Well, no, I'm just saying,"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"there's a band called Better Than Ezra,"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"so that means they're better than you."""
02:01:17;02:01:20;"And I'd just be kind of like, ""All right,"
02:01:20;02:01:22;"the band that does good is better than me."""
02:01:22;02:01:24;"An 11-year-old in New Jersey, it just like,"
02:01:24;02:01:26;"it wasn't that easy. - It doesn't last."
02:01:26;02:01:27;"- Yeah, it wasn't that easy."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"It seemed like it would, but it never did."
02:01:29;02:01:32;"So in fact, it just became more of like a,"
02:01:32;02:01:34;"yeah, was there a Jake thing?"
02:01:34;02:01:37;"- Well, Jake the Snake, but it was like, ""That rules."""
02:01:37;02:01:38;"(laughing)"
02:01:38;02:01:40;"- Oh, yeah. - Right, the wrestler."
02:01:40;02:01:41;"- Like, ""Jake the Snake!"""
02:01:41;02:01:42;"And I'd be like, ""Hell yeah."""
02:01:42;02:01:44;"(laughing)"
02:01:44;02:01:47;"- Hey, guys, I gotta say, by the way,"
02:01:47;02:01:49;"this reminded me of earlier when I was talking"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"about nom and clad of dissonance."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"I would kick myself if I didn't correct myself."
02:01:53;02:01:55;"I messed that up so bad."
02:01:55;02:01:59;"The term is actually nominative determinism,"
02:01:59;02:02:02;"and I just feel like for posterity and for listening,"
02:02:02;02:02:04;"I don't wanna like-- - Appreciate that."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"- Yeah, I don't wanna miseducate anybody."
02:02:06;02:02:08;"- Noted. - Nominative determinism"
02:02:08;02:02:10;"is the phrase. - Right."
02:02:10;02:02:13;"Okay, that makes sense, 'cause your name determines,"
02:02:13;02:02:15;"your lifestyle determines your death style."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"Your name determines your--"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"(laughing)"
02:02:18;02:02:23;"- I feel like a lot of dudes named Jake love snakes."
02:02:23;02:02:26;"That'd be tight if you became a snake guy, Jake."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"- A snake expert."
02:02:27;02:02:30;"- Has there ever been, I guess Slash probably did,"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"I'm just trying, I was just like picturing you on stage"
02:02:32;02:02:34;"with Richard Pictures just with like a python"
02:02:34;02:02:38;"draped over you, just holding it down."
02:02:38;02:02:40;"- That would be insane."
02:02:40;02:02:43;"- And actually, I think, you know,"
02:02:43;02:02:46;"people get very touchy when people bring their animals"
02:02:46;02:02:49;"to shows, even their little dogs and stuff,"
02:02:49;02:02:52;"because fair point, concerts are very loud,"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"and maybe it's not that cool to bring your little dog"
02:02:54;02:02:56;"to like a rock show."
02:02:56;02:02:59;"But I feel like this is like a kind of Snapple fact,"
02:02:59;02:03:01;"aren't snakes deaf, technically?"
02:03:01;02:03:02;"- Oh, I don't know that."
02:03:02;02:03:04;"- You could just be (beep) wearing--"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"- A Snapple snake. - On stage."
02:03:06;02:03:08;"They don't have ears."
02:03:08;02:03:10;"- This is my therapy snake."
02:03:10;02:03:11;"Oh yeah, snakes are deaf."
02:03:11;02:03:13;"- I'm gonna really lobby for this"
02:03:13;02:03:15;"as concerts come back post-COVID,"
02:03:15;02:03:19;"because we're gonna really need as many people as possible"
02:03:19;02:03:22;"out there saving the live music industry."
02:03:22;02:03:24;"And I'm just gonna say to all the powers that be,"
02:03:24;02:03:28;"like, all right, let's let people bring their snakes"
02:03:28;02:03:31;"to concerts, because we can't alienate,"
02:03:31;02:03:36;"needlessly alienate a whole slice of the population"
02:03:36;02:03:37;"who would love to come to the show,"
02:03:37;02:03:39;"but they don't wanna leave their snake at home."
02:03:39;02:03:41;"I wanna be doing a Vampire Weekend show"
02:03:41;02:03:45;"where I look out there and I see one to 200 snakes"
02:03:45;02:03:48;"dispersed in the crowd on the shoulders of our fans."
02:03:48;02:03:51;"Of course, they have to be non-poisonous, but--"
02:03:51;02:03:52;"- Of course."
02:03:52;02:03:53;"- Maybe we'll get into that."
02:03:53;02:03:56;"I mean, I remember, like, the snake is now"
02:03:56;02:03:59;"a significant part of Vampire Weekend iconography."
02:03:59;02:04:00;"- That is true, man."
02:04:00;02:04:03;"- I mean, and I remember when we made the Harmony Hall video"
02:04:03;02:04:06;"there's a snake in it that slithers around on some stuff,"
02:04:06;02:04:10;"and just like always, animal wranglers"
02:04:10;02:04:12;"are just such fascinating characters."
02:04:12;02:04:16;"And it was like this older Australian dude,"
02:04:16;02:04:20;"like, of course, just the exact kind of conversations"
02:04:20;02:04:21;"you think you'd probably have"
02:04:21;02:04:24;"with a Hollywood snake wrangler,"
02:04:24;02:04:27;"and just being kind of like, I remember we were all"
02:04:27;02:04:29;"sitting around making small talk with the dude."
02:04:29;02:04:31;"Everybody was like, ""Oh my God, it's this big snake."""
02:04:31;02:04:32;"Everybody was kind of freaked out."
02:04:32;02:04:36;"He's just like, ""Don't worry, they won't bite you."""
02:04:36;02:04:37;"He's actually a real sweetheart."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"And then somebody's like, ""Have you ever been bitten"
02:04:39;02:04:42;"by a snake?"" And he was just like, ""Hundreds of times."""
02:04:42;02:04:43;"(laughs)"
02:04:43;02:04:47;"Anyway, this has been Time Crisis."
02:04:47;02:04:49;"Getting back in the game 2021."
02:04:49;02:04:50;"We'll see you in two weeks."
02:04:50;02:04:52;"Thanks for waiting."
02:04:52;02:04:55;"I know that was a long break from TC for us too."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"Anyway, here's Better Than Ezra with their hit song, ""Good."""
