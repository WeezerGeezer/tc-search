00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis in a time of crisis."
00:05;00:08;"There's a lot going on in the world you can barely keep up."
00:08;00:10;"But one thing's for sure."
00:10;00:15;"The TC crew will come together, whatever it takes."
00:15;00:22;"In a time of coronavirus and other strange, distressing things."
00:22;00:25;"This is a very unusual..."
00:25;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:30;00:34;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:38;00:44;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:44;00:51;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:05;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go."
01:05;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:20;"[Phone ringing]"
01:20;01:22;"Time Crisis back again."
01:22;01:24;"Business as usual."
01:24;01:26;"[Laughter]"
01:26;01:28;"Just the old TC."
01:28;01:31;"Well, here's the thing, gang."
01:31;01:35;"This is the first Time Crisis ever where we're not in the same room."
01:35;01:38;"I mean, the real sticklers might say,"
01:38;01:41;"""Well, of course, in the early days, there, you know,"
01:41;01:43;"there have been episodes where Jake called in."""
01:43;01:46;"But I mean in the sense that literally,"
01:46;01:50;"none of the crew is in the same place."
01:50;01:54;"Of course, we've had, you know, some slight exceptions,"
01:54;01:56;"but this is very unusual."
01:56;02:00;"This is a true coronavirus episode in that we are conferencing in."
02:00;02:02;"We're all in the same city."
02:02;02:04;"Very strange."
02:04;02:07;"This is going to have a great flow, I can tell already."
02:07;02:10;"[Laughter]"
02:10;02:12;"Everybody's at home."
02:12;02:16;"We were advised it was better to stay put, not all get together,"
02:16;02:19;"which certainly is true for large crowds."
02:19;02:22;"Maybe it's even true for small gatherings."
02:22;02:26;"Well, you know, I've had a fever the last three days."
02:26;02:28;"It was kind of my call."
02:28;02:33;"It would be irresponsible to expose the TC family to my low-grade fever."
02:33;02:38;"Now, I feel more or less fine, but I was just like--"
02:38;02:41;"Everything I was reading was like emphasizing"
02:41;02:44;"how life and death social distancing is."
02:44;02:46;"And since we're in the sort of early days here,"
02:46;02:49;"I just thought, you know, I would take it seriously,"
02:49;02:51;"do the group a solid, and just be like,"
02:51;02:54;"""Guys, let's just do a weird conference call."""
02:54;02:56;"Don't mess around. Don't mess around."
02:56;02:58;"Well, all right, so let's start with that, Jake."
02:58;03:03;"That must have been stressful to wake up with a fever a few days ago, right?"
03:03;03:05;"Yeah, well, it came out of the evening."
03:05;03:06;"Have you been following the news?"
03:06;03:07;"Just a little bit."
03:07;03:11;"Yeah, okay. So how did you feel when you woke up with a fever?"
03:11;03:13;"Well, it was one of those-- I didn't feel great about it."
03:13;03:17;"It was also one of those things where I'd listen to a few podcasts"
03:17;03:22;"about coronavirus and read stuff on the New York Times and stuff."
03:22;03:24;"And then I started to feel a fever come on,"
03:24;03:27;"and I was like, ""Is this just psychosomatic?"""
03:27;03:31;"""Is this just rendering itself?"""
03:31;03:34;"But then, no, I actually truly did have a fever"
03:34;03:36;"and felt sort of achy."
03:36;03:38;"Luckily, didn't develop a cough."
03:38;03:40;"Honestly, I have no idea."
03:40;03:42;"I might have a very low-grade version of it."
03:42;03:44;"I might not. I don't know."
03:44;03:47;"And I had the fever kind of on and off for the last two days."
03:47;03:48;"Today, I'm feeling better."
03:48;03:50;"So you've just been at home this whole time?"
03:50;03:54;"Yeah, the last two days, three days."
03:54;03:56;"Didn't hit the bowling alley."
03:56;03:59;"Yeah, had to cancel the league game."
03:59;04:01;"Didn't go crush burritos."
04:01;04:02;"Didn't crush burritos."
04:02;04:05;"Just imagine if you were like patient zero,"
04:05;04:07;"and they're like, ""So this guy had a fever."""
04:07;04:10;"It's like in all the global newspapers, and it's like,"
04:10;04:13;"""So this man in Los Angeles, Jake Longstreet, what did he do?"""
04:13;04:16;"And they're like, ""He went to Richard Pictures practice."""
04:16;04:18;"That's his great cover band."
04:18;04:20;"He went to Chipotle."
04:20;04:23;"He went to Chipotle. He crushed a burrito."
04:23;04:25;"Emphasis on crushed."
04:25;04:29;"Just the whole world talking about it."
04:29;04:32;"Richard Pictures trending on global Twitter."
04:32;04:36;"Right. Chipotle, Eagle Rock trending."
04:36;04:43;"I just opened up Twitter, and one of the trending topics was total chaos."
04:43;04:47;"And was it about something specific, or just everybody's talking about total chaos?"
04:47;04:50;"I didn't click on it. I was just sort of like, ""Wow, that's a cool..."""
04:50;04:53;"It's probably a reference to Target and people,"
04:53;04:58;"like all the pandemonium over toilet paper and canned soup and all that stuff."
04:58;05:01;"I don't get the TP stuff."
05:01;05:06;"That seems kind of low on the totem pole in terms of essential items."
05:06;05:10;"Not if you're at home for three weeks."
05:10;05:14;"I think it's just more about just not leaving the house."
05:14;05:17;"Yeah, no, I get that, but I'm just saying..."
05:17;05:19;"Why that in particular?"
05:19;05:21;"I mean, there's a lot..."
05:21;05:23;"A lot of people have been asking that question."
05:23;05:27;"I think, you know, probably all families are different."
05:27;05:29;"[laughter]"
05:29;05:35;"It's true. If you have a household with a bunch of teenagers"
05:35;05:38;"who are just constantly taking huge stews,"
05:38;05:40;"and they got up..."
05:40;05:45;"There it is. You guys, like the family's going through a case of TP a week."
05:45;05:47;"I found something interesting, guys."
05:47;05:52;"Normally, this is something I would show Ezra rather than chime in."
05:52;05:58;"But according to CNBC, there's an article that says the reason toilet paper is..."
05:58;06:00;"People are going nuts for toilet paper,"
06:00;06:05;"it's become ""an icon of mass panic,"""
06:05;06:08;"and that in times of uncertainty, people enter a panic zone"
06:08;06:11;"that makes them irrational and completely neurotic."
06:11;06:13;"So they just are buying toilet paper."
06:13;06:15;"It's like some primal..."
06:15;06:17;"They're not even thinking about what they're buying."
06:17;06:19;"They're just going, ""Oh, I need to stockpile."""
06:19;06:20;"Okay."
06:20;06:23;"""Icon of mass panic."" I think that's sort of a..."
06:23;06:26;"Well, I wonder how it became an icon of mass panic."
06:26;06:29;"It is a non-essential item."
06:29;06:31;"Wait, but isn't there something to, like..."
06:31;06:34;"People are drawn... Sorry, sorry, sorry."
06:34;06:38;"People are drawn to large packaging that toilet paper comes in"
06:38;06:41;"when they're looking to regain a sense of control."
06:41;06:42;"I can see that."
06:42;06:46;"Okay, isn't there a connection to having a flu and, like..."
06:46;06:48;"God, what am I talking about here?"
06:48;06:50;"-Well, yeah. -Do you know what I'm saying, though?"
06:50;06:52;"Yeah, it can be."
06:52;06:56;"I don't know if people are thinking quite that far ahead."
06:56;07:01;"And even if they are, I like this psychological take"
07:01;07:04;"because it's interesting to think that"
07:04;07:07;"it's somehow just ingrained in the American psyche."
07:07;07:09;"Although, clearly, a lot of other countries, too."
07:09;07:12;"You've heard similar stories in the UK and Australia."
07:12;07:15;"Maybe it's an Anglo-Saxon thing."
07:15;07:18;"Those Anglo-Saxons loom large over the English-speaking countries."
07:18;07:21;"But there's something about grabbing the toilet paper."
07:21;07:25;"I also feel like it's interesting to think that that's an act"
07:25;07:28;"that makes a powerless person feel in control."
07:28;07:30;"Because there is something funny."
07:30;07:34;"It's one of the biggest items that people regularly buy"
07:34;07:36;"that's very light."
07:36;07:38;"So I wonder if there's just something about"
07:38;07:40;"when you just hold up that 24-pack"
07:40;07:42;"and you're just like..."
07:42;07:47;"Just on a really basic psychological level."
07:47;07:49;"It's like if you could go to the gym"
07:49;07:51;"and there was a dumbbell made out of toilet paper."
07:51;07:53;"You'd just be like..."
07:53;07:56;"It is a funny feeling, holding a big-ass..."
07:56;07:59;"like, 48-pack of paper towels or toilet paper."
07:59;08:01;"It makes you feel like a big man."
08:01;08:03;"Even though you're weak."
08:03;08:05;"It's like a bale of hay or something."
08:05;08:07;"Right."
08:07;08:09;"Maybe it's a symbol of..."
08:09;08:14;"Just a 24-pack of really plush, double-ply TP"
08:14;08:18;"is a symbol of the safety and affluence and security"
08:18;08:21;"of our normal daily lives"
08:21;08:23;"in a country like the US."
08:23;08:26;"And most people just quite literally couldn't pick up"
08:26;08:28;"a 24-pack of soup."
08:28;08:29;"No."
08:29;08:31;"It's like, you know, with the cardboard bottom"
08:31;08:33;"and the plastic on the top, you try to pick that up"
08:33;08:34;"it would make you feel weak."
08:34;08:35;"And you'd be like, ""You know what?"""
08:35;08:37;"Even though you might need the soup more."
08:37;08:39;"You'd be like, ""You know what? I don't need that."""
08:39;08:42;"""Let me get this big-ass..."
08:42;08:45;"giant TP thing."""
08:45;08:48;"Gonna need the A-truck for that case of soup."
08:48;08:51;"I kind of even remember that feeling like being a kid"
08:51;08:55;"helping your parents unload the car"
08:55;08:57;"after going shopping."
08:57;09:00;"Like, there's something about picking up that big-ass"
09:00;09:03;"thing of paper towels or toilet paper."
09:03;09:05;"It's like a false feeling of strength."
09:05;09:08;"And then it's like, ""Where does this go? This is huge."""
09:08;09:11;"""Just chuck it anywhere."" ""All right, phwoar!"""
09:11;09:15;"Get some real distance."
09:15;09:20;"Walk me out in the morning"
09:20;09:24;"Do my part"
09:24;09:36;"Walk me out in the morning"
09:36;09:41;"Do today"
09:41;09:44;"Do tomorrow"
09:44;09:56;"Can't walk out in the morning"
09:56;10:00;"Do tomorrow"
10:08;10:11;"Walk me out in the morning"
10:11;10:14;"Do today"
10:14;10:17;"But, you know, seriously, we're at a very interesting moment."
10:17;10:20;"I've been looking at it through the lens of the music industry."
10:20;10:23;"You know, a reminder to listeners, I'm a music industry professional."
10:23;10:27;"I've been hearing murmurs for months now"
10:27;10:29;"about what might get cancelled."
10:29;10:32;"I think the first time I heard somebody say"
10:32;10:35;"Coachella might get cancelled was almost a month ago."
10:35;10:38;"And people were like, ""No way. Not gonna happen."""
10:38;10:41;"And people were just like, ""I don't know, man. Think about it."""
10:41;10:44;"""They wouldn't have Coachella in Wuhan right now. Think about it."""
10:44;10:46;"And there was a lot of pushback."
10:46;10:50;"And then we even did a festival as recently as last weekend."
10:50;10:53;"Last Saturday, we were in Okeechobee, Florida at the Okeechobee Festival."
10:53;10:56;"You know, it was like a good vibe at the festival. It was very cold."
10:56;10:59;"It was kind of surprising for Florida how cold it was."
10:59;11:01;"That made it a slightly strange vibe."
11:01;11:04;"But there was this weird feeling, like when we walked off stage,"
11:04;11:06;"we all kind of looked at each other like,"
11:06;11:09;"""Could this be our last show of the year?"""
11:09;11:11;"It was about to get wild."
11:11;11:14;"And nobody knew, but we knew it was a distinct possibility."
11:14;11:17;"And so I've been hearing from a lot of music people about,"
11:17;11:22;"""Well, okay, they cancelled that thing, but they had certain reasoning for it."""
11:22;11:24;"""They cancelled Ultra Festival in Miami."""
11:24;11:28;"And the reasoning I heard was because that's a very international festival."
11:28;11:30;"And I think people were being optimistic, being like,"
11:30;11:33;"""Well, an international festival, you've got people from all around the world."""
11:33;11:38;"But there's no reason why you can't have more of a local festival or show, right?"
11:38;11:41;"People were kind of bargaining at that time."
11:41;11:45;"And just day by day, you just heard more and more stuff get cancelled."
11:45;11:51;"I had a conversation with one of our dudes who helps us run the whole live business."
11:51;11:54;"And we were just talking about shows we had coming up."
11:54;11:56;"I'm like, ""Man, I hope that doesn't get cancelled. It'd be cool."""
11:56;11:58;"""What do you think? Is it going to happen?"""
11:58;12:00;"We're both kind of like, ""I don't know."""
12:00;12:03;"And then within an hour of us getting off the phone,"
12:03;12:08;"Pearl Jam cancelled their tour, and Coachella cancelled/postponed."
12:08;12:11;"So it seems like it's very quickly changing."
12:11;12:18;"And now I kind of wonder, could this be the year of no music?"
12:18;12:20;"I don't know, man. I'm just wondering."
12:20;12:22;"We're going to learn quite a bit in the next few weeks."
12:22;12:25;"Yeah, I mean, it seems like everything's getting pushed to the fall,"
12:25;12:28;"where it's just going to be nonstop shows in the fall."
12:28;12:30;"Yeah, it sounds a little optimistic."
12:30;12:32;"You think so?"
12:32;12:35;"Well, yeah. I mean, I don't want to dwell on the music industry,"
12:35;12:41;"because so many people are going to be suffering and stressed about money."
12:41;12:44;"People in restaurants, people who work at restaurants,"
12:44;12:47;"people who work all sorts of jobs where you can't go in."
12:47;12:49;"There's so many people in precarious situations."
12:49;12:52;"But I think with music, you've got to understand,"
12:52;12:56;"I'm really just brainstorming. I don't have any inside information."
12:56;13:01;"Just from where I sit, you've got to picture how much money is at stake."
13:01;13:06;"If you run a festival or something, you plan all year for it."
13:06;13:08;"All your money comes in from that."
13:08;13:10;"And insurance is going to be a nightmare."
13:10;13:15;"And the bands, us musicians, we really count on some of these gigs."
13:15;13:19;"So the idea of just cancelling something is insane."
13:19;13:23;"So I think people, rather than cancelling things,"
13:23;13:26;"before they do that, they look for dates in the future,"
13:26;13:28;"and they choose them."
13:28;13:30;"And then they say, ""All right, we're just postponing it."""
13:30;13:33;"And then you don't have to deal with the nightmare of"
13:33;13:36;"refunding all the people who bought tickets,"
13:36;13:39;"and having to declare bankruptcy."
13:39;13:42;"Think about all the crazy things that would happen if you're just a business,"
13:42;13:45;"and your main source of income for the year just goes out the window."
13:45;13:48;"So understandably, people are looking to the fall as a time"
13:48;13:50;"when you can move things around."
13:50;13:53;"Just me as a civilian, thinking out loud,"
13:53;13:58;"I'm just like, ""Is there any reason to believe that that will actually happen?"""
13:58;14:01;"It's just so dependent on what the next couple of months are like."
14:01;14:05;"There's also the theory that, based on what's happened with pandemics in the past,"
14:05;14:09;"that the fall can actually be a particularly brutal time."
14:09;14:14;"Like the Spanish flu in 1918 comes back with a vengeance after the summer."
14:14;14:17;"Truly, that won't be the case."
14:17;14:20;"But you can also just imagine,"
14:20;14:23;"let's really hope that things are mellow,"
14:23;14:27;"that even though the US is kind of behind with some of the preventative measures,"
14:27;14:30;"the fact that big things are getting canceled now will halt the spread."
14:30;14:33;"But let's say the next couple of months are gnarly,"
14:33;14:36;"even just psychologically gnarly."
14:36;14:39;"When it starts getting cold again next October,"
14:39;14:42;"I wonder what kind of mood the nation is going to be in."
14:42;14:43;"You know what I'm saying?"
14:43;14:45;"Yeah. I don't like it."
14:45;14:47;"Okay, so I'll be right back. I got Postmates here."
14:47;14:49;"For real?"
14:49;14:51;"Is this a bit?"
14:51;14:54;"No, no, no. I ordered like an hour ago."
14:54;14:56;"They just came. I'll be right back."
14:56;14:58;"Don't take-- leave the bag outside."
14:58;15:00;"Okay."
15:00;15:01;"No, for real."
15:01;15:04;"I like that he's supporting a local restaurant, though."
15:04;15:05;"Yeah."
15:05;15:07;"And you better give that dude a big tip."
15:07;15:08;"Oh, hell yeah."
15:08;15:10;"Have you guys shaken anyone's hands?"
15:10;15:11;"No."
15:11;15:12;"Recently?"
15:12;15:13;"I stopped-- well, you know what's funny?"
15:13;15:15;"I don't know what triggered it for me,"
15:15;15:18;"but I kind of became very anti-handshaking"
15:18;15:20;"about two months ago."
15:20;15:22;"Ahead of the curve as usual."
15:22;15:23;"Yeah."
15:23;15:25;"I'm just kind of a visionary, I guess."
15:25;15:27;"No, but I mean, maybe I was--"
15:27;15:29;"I mean, obviously--"
15:29;15:31;"Actually, it was more like four or five months ago."
15:31;15:34;"It was before you're reading about corona."
15:34;15:36;"Well, here's the number one thing,"
15:36;15:38;"is that obviously--"
15:38;15:40;"and this is very common, Nick,"
15:40;15:42;"other members of the crew can back me up on this--"
15:42;15:44;"when children come into your life,"
15:44;15:47;"you do start to think more about hygiene."
15:47;15:50;"And I've always been a clean dude."
15:50;15:53;"I know people who refuse to wash their hands,"
15:53;15:55;"and I've just always been like, ""What the-- come on."""
15:55;15:58;"But this idea that you would never enter your house"
15:58;16:00;"without immediately going to wash your hands,"
16:00;16:03;"I don't think I really felt that way until--"
16:03;16:04;"Mm."
16:04;16:05;"Of course, yeah."
16:05;16:09;"I'm sharing space with a sensitive little baby,"
16:09;16:11;"and you get freaked out about that [bleep]"
16:11;16:13;"and then you also notice, like,"
16:13;16:15;"when people come over to your house,"
16:15;16:17;"you have to sometimes prod people to wash their hands,"
16:17;16:19;"and then you just realize, ""Oh, yeah, there's just--"
16:19;16:21;"people think about this stuff differently."""
16:21;16:23;"So once that gets into your head,"
16:23;16:24;"you almost--like, your hands almost, like,"
16:24;16:26;"start to feel dirty."
16:26;16:27;"You know what I mean?"
16:27;16:29;"You turn a psychological corner or something,"
16:29;16:30;"so it's like you get home,"
16:30;16:32;"and you want to, like, say what's up to everybody,"
16:32;16:34;"you know, be affectionate,"
16:34;16:36;"grab something, grab a snack,"
16:36;16:37;"maybe you're hungry or thirsty,"
16:37;16:39;"and then eventually you turn a corner"
16:39;16:42;"where the idea of doing that, like, stresses you out"
16:42;16:43;"because you feel like your hands are dirty"
16:43;16:44;"'cause you were outside."
16:44;16:45;"I never felt that way,"
16:45;16:47;"even though I was a relatively clean person,"
16:47;16:48;"I never felt that way."
16:48;16:51;"So that was already kind of in my head, you know,"
16:51;16:53;"the last year-plus."
16:53;16:54;"Yeah."
16:54;16:55;"And then there was just something--"
16:55;16:56;"maybe I got sick after a tour,"
16:56;16:57;"and I was just, like, on my mind,"
16:57;16:59;"and I just started to have this feeling,"
16:59;17:00;"especially when I'd meet a stranger"
17:00;17:02;"and they'd come up and say something"
17:02;17:04;"and put their hand out to shake."
17:04;17:05;"I just couldn't help it."
17:05;17:07;"I'd start to just, like, really pause"
17:07;17:09;"and not want to do it."
17:09;17:10;"And occasionally I'd still do it,"
17:10;17:12;"but I just started to feel, like, weird about it."
17:12;17:14;"So maybe I became a little bit of a germaphobe."
17:14;17:16;"But the past few months,"
17:16;17:17;"I definitely had a few times"
17:17;17:18;"where, like, somebody would come up"
17:18;17:20;"and they'd be perfectly nice, like, respectful,"
17:20;17:22;"and they'd put their hand out to shake,"
17:22;17:23;"and I'm just kind of like--"
17:23;17:25;"it felt too extra to me to be like,"
17:25;17:28;"""Hey, I'm not, like, trying to shake hands right now."""
17:28;17:30;"I couldn't bring myself to say that."
17:30;17:32;"But I would just kind of look at their hand"
17:32;17:33;"and just, like, you know,"
17:33;17:35;"pause, like, a few seconds too long."
17:35;17:36;"And most of the time people would get it"
17:36;17:38;"and maybe just, like, pat me on the shoulder or something,"
17:38;17:41;"or just--we'd move on with the conversation."
17:41;17:42;"- Would you do fist bump?"
17:42;17:45;"- No, I didn't really want to, like, be skin to skin."
17:45;17:46;"I don't know. - Like, get screwed up."
17:46;17:48;"- I'd turn some kind of corner."
17:48;17:49;"It just felt too--"
17:49;17:51;"I think a lot of people have that moment in their life"
17:51;17:54;"where they're just like, ""Why do people shake hands?"
17:54;17:58;"""It's such a weird, like, way to, like, show respect"
17:58;17:59;"and introduce yourself."
17:59;18:00;"Who needs it?"""
18:00;18:03;"And I think quite a few people agree with it now."
18:03;18:05;"But it was a different story a few months ago."
18:05;18:08;"And I also just couldn't bring myself"
18:08;18:12;"to ever say out loud something along the lines of,"
18:12;18:15;"""I'm not much of a handshaker. Oh, I got a thing."""
18:15;18:18;"And the truth is, I don't even feel like a germaphobe,"
18:18;18:19;"necessarily."
18:19;18:20;"I just got, like--"
18:20;18:21;"there's just something about handshaking."
18:21;18:22;"It's like, you think about it too long,"
18:22;18:24;"and you're like, ""It doesn't make sense."""
18:24;18:27;"So, yeah, I couldn't bring myself to say anything."
18:27;18:28;"Actually, I kind of remember--"
18:28;18:29;"I think, Nick, you told me a story once"
18:29;18:31;"about, you know, somebody who doesn't shake hands"
18:31;18:35;"and gets them in all sorts of unusual situations."
18:35;18:36;"Yeah."
18:36;18:38;"People really dislike it, too."
18:38;18:41;"Well, and also, I guess there's different levels to it."
18:41;18:42;"There's the level of being, like,"
18:42;18:45;"you meet, like, a total stranger comes up to you"
18:45;18:46;"and says, ""What's up?"""
18:46;18:47;"And you're kind of like,"
18:47;18:49;"""Oh, okay, I don't know this person at all."""
18:49;18:52;"And then there's also a level of being, you know,"
18:52;18:53;"entering, like, a business meeting,"
18:53;18:55;"where it's just like, ""Hey, like, Jake,"
18:55;18:57;"how the hell are you? Put it there."
18:57;18:59;"Haven't seen you in a few months."""
18:59;19:02;"And you're just like, ""Nah."""
19:02;19:03;"[Sighs]"
19:03;19:04;"[Chuckles]"
19:04;19:05;"Very Larry."
19:05;19:07;"That would have made people feel kind of strange."
19:07;19:08;"I was thinking about it today,"
19:08;19:10;"'cause I was on the plane home, you know,"
19:10;19:15;"and I was watching ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."""
19:15;19:17;"Sort of at the beginning of the movie is,"
19:17;19:18;"you know, when they're--"
19:18;19:20;"Russo and Franks and Al Pacino's there,"
19:20;19:24;"and he meets Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio."
19:24;19:26;"And he says, ""Oh, who's your friend over here?"""
19:26;19:29;"And they just do this really intense,"
19:29;19:33;"sort of almost, like, very masculine handshake."
19:33;19:35;"And I was like, ""Ew."""
19:35;19:36;"[Chuckles]"
19:36;19:37;"Right."
19:37;19:39;"I just--the way they filmed it,"
19:39;19:42;"these two men with the big hands,"
19:42;19:43;"it was, like, gross."
19:43;19:46;"But, Nick, did you think that when you saw the movie?"
19:46;19:47;"No, no, it's all--"
19:47;19:48;"No, it's being on a plane"
19:48;19:51;"in the middle of, like, the coronavirus here."
19:51;19:53;"The whole thing, everything,"
19:53;19:56;"it's, like, good red film."
19:56;19:58;"Going to Florida the other week,"
19:58;20:02;"I found being on site at the festival totally normal."
20:02;20:04;"You know, like, of course, like,"
20:04;20:06;"it crossed my mind, like, okay,"
20:06;20:09;"well, like, the people at the festival feel comfortable."
20:09;20:11;"But for me, you know, just warming up backstage,"
20:11;20:12;"being on stage,"
20:12;20:14;"I'm not particularly close to anybody."
20:14;20:16;"That didn't feel too weird."
20:16;20:18;"It was actually just the travel part,"
20:18;20:19;"being on planes."
20:19;20:23;"That's--there was something very unpleasant about that,"
20:23;20:24;"being on a plane."
20:24;20:27;"And I swear, I'm sure it's changing day by day,"
20:27;20:28;"but on my plane home,"
20:28;20:30;"I saw a few older folks, I swear,"
20:30;20:32;"just open-mouth coughing,"
20:32;20:33;"just not giving a [bleep]"
20:33;20:35;"and it wasn't quite at the place yet"
20:35;20:38;"where I didn't see them getting glares or anything."
20:38;20:41;"There were a few people with masks on the flight,"
20:41;20:43;"some vibes about it,"
20:43;20:45;"but it definitely hadn't turned a corner yet."
20:45;20:47;"I imagine this weekend, if--"
20:47;20:48;"Oh, yeah."
20:48;20:49;"I'm sure there's far less people flying."
20:49;20:52;"Both of my flights to Miami were relatively full."
20:52;20:53;"People were asking me, like,"
20:53;20:55;"""Yo, was the airport a ghost town?"""
20:55;20:57;"And last weekend, it was not."
20:57;20:59;"I bet this weekend,"
20:59;21:01;"like, a week changes a whole lot."
21:01;21:02;"- Man."
21:02;21:04;"- There's no reason to, like, make predictions about it,"
21:04;21:06;"but my general sense is, like,"
21:06;21:08;"I really hope that, you know,"
21:08;21:11;"in terms of people's health and the spread of the virus,"
21:11;21:13;"that can be under control"
21:13;21:16;"and maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised in some way."
21:16;21:19;"But I think no matter what,"
21:19;21:21;"it's just gonna be a very strange year."
21:21;21:23;"'Cause just, like, psychologically,"
21:23;21:24;"with things getting canceled"
21:24;21:26;"and people not knowing what to do with themselves,"
21:26;21:28;"and I think there's gonna be all sorts of, like,"
21:28;21:32;"very strange secondary results."
21:32;21:33;"- Economically and whatnot."
21:33;21:35;"- Economically and then, of course, like,"
21:35;21:38;"people who have totally unrelated health issues."
21:38;21:41;"You know, that's a big issue, is, like, over-related ICUs."
21:41;21:43;"If you have a totally unrelated health issue,"
21:43;21:47;"I really just hope that we can halt the spread of this."
21:47;21:49;"I just don't want to hear, like, brutal stories."
21:49;21:52;"It's like, ""Uh, yeah, my buddy, like, broke his arm,"
21:52;21:55;"""and he sat in the ER in agonizing pain"
21:55;21:58;"in the waiting room for 30 hours."""
21:58;22:00;"And I guess that's not even that bad compared to"
22:00;22:01;"""I Don't Want to Heart Street"""
22:01;22:03;"pulled out with imagining even worse scenarios."
22:03;22:04;"But, like, that's the type of sh--"
22:04;22:06;"where it's, like, you don't want it--"
22:06;22:08;"you don't want it to get to that point."
22:09;22:18;"♪ I thought I heard a baby cry this morning ♪"
22:18;22:35;"♪ Thought I heard a baby cry today ♪"
22:35;22:40;"♪"
22:40;22:53;"♪ You didn't hear no baby cry this morning ♪"
23:01;23:12;"♪ You didn't hear no baby cry today ♪"
23:12;23:15;"Well, hopefully this is our only TC"
23:15;23:17;"that we're doing remotely."
23:17;23:18;"FaceTime crisis."
23:18;23:20;"Hopefully, two weeks from now,"
23:20;23:23;"we'll have a better sense of the situation."
23:23;23:25;"Maybe by then, Seinfeld, you could get"
23:25;23:27;"one of those temperature guns."
23:27;23:28;"[coughs]"
23:29;23:31;"Well, I saw, like, in China very quickly,"
23:31;23:35;"they had these kind of, like, temperature guns"
23:35;23:36;"where they, like, pointed at you"
23:36;23:38;"and read your temperature."
23:38;23:41;"Oh, sh--, I did not know about the temperature guns."
23:41;23:42;"I guess it's a type of thermometer,"
23:42;23:44;"but it kind of looks like they just, like,"
23:44;23:45;"pointed at people."
23:45;23:48;"And if your fever's too high, can't enter."
23:48;23:51;"So maybe you can track down one of those,"
23:51;23:54;"and, you know, in two weeks from now,"
23:54;23:55;"if everybody's okay,"
23:55;23:57;"then I think we can get together."
23:57;23:59;"We have to stay healthy, you know,"
23:59;24:02;"four to five feet apart from each other."
24:02;24:03;"Which we normally are."
24:03;24:04;"Yeah."
24:04;24:07;"How are you guys doing with the face touching?"
24:07;24:09;"I feel like I'm touching my face more than ever."
24:09;24:11;"It's like when you say, like, don't,"
24:11;24:12;"like, when you're meditating,"
24:12;24:13;"and you're like, don't think,"
24:13;24:15;"and of course, you think a lot more."
24:15;24:17;"Or maybe I'm just more conscious"
24:17;24:19;"of how much I'm touching my face."
24:19;24:20;"That's a tough one, 'cause also,"
24:20;24:23;"one would hope that if you're washing your hands"
24:23;24:26;"constantly, and you're only in one place,"
24:26;24:30;"like, scratching your, like, upper forehead"
24:30;24:33;"is not, like, putting you at serious risk."
24:33;24:36;"But, you know, I get where they're coming from."
24:36;24:38;"Oh, man, I'm washing my hands like crazy."
24:38;24:40;"Like, they're all dry."
24:40;24:42;"Yeah."
24:42;24:44;"Are you in a bathroom right now, Seinfeld?"
24:44;24:45;"I am in a bathroom, yeah."
24:45;24:48;"It's like, it's the best acoustics."
24:48;24:51;"Is that Seinfeld's office?"
24:51;24:54;"No, I'm trying to reduce noise here."
24:54;24:55;"Oh."
24:55;24:57;"Or stay away from the noise."
24:57;24:59;"Get a little nice natural reverb?"
24:59;25:00;"Yeah."
25:00;25:02;"I just caught a glimpse of your toilet."
25:02;25:03;"No, you did not."
25:03;25:04;"I did!"
25:04;25:06;"Yeah, yeah, you were panning around."
25:06;25:07;"Well, I'm in a bathroom,"
25:07;25:08;"but there is a toilet here."
25:08;25:11;"Looks like a nice, clean bathroom."
25:11;25:12;"Thanks."
25:12;25:14;"Jake, what part of the house are you in?"
25:14;25:15;"I'm standing in the kitchen now,"
25:15;25:19;"which is proper TC, proper TC form."
25:19;25:22;"I usually stand when we're taping the episodes."
25:22;25:26;"Standing in the kitchen."
25:26;25:28;"And I was sitting,"
25:28;25:31;"but then my phone started to die really quickly."
25:31;25:34;"So I'm standing, plugged in,"
25:34;25:35;"standing over the sink."
25:35;25:38;"Maybe bang out a few dishes"
25:38;25:42;"as we're taping, just..."
25:42;25:43;"What devices are you guys on?"
25:43;25:45;"Am I the only one on my cell phone?"
25:45;25:47;"No, I'm on my phone."
25:47;25:48;"No, I'm on my phone, too."
25:48;25:49;"Oh, [bleep]"
25:49;25:50;"Oh, wow, okay."
25:50;25:52;"Ezra, you look very stationary."
25:52;25:55;"Your phone is up against something."
25:55;25:56;"Yeah, I put it..."
25:56;25:57;"I'm sitting at a desk."
25:57;25:58;"All right."
25:58;25:59;"But first of all,"
25:59;26:02;"I think it's great that they're cancelling all this stuff."
26:02;26:04;"I think the appropriate way to think about it"
26:04;26:07;"is that the cancelling stuff"
26:07;26:09;"doesn't mean that they're reacting,"
26:09;26:11;"the world is so [bleep] up that like,"
26:11;26:13;"""Oh my God, we can't even do this."""
26:13;26:15;"It's a preventative move."
26:15;26:16;"It's probably happening a bit late,"
26:16;26:19;"but it shows that people are taking it seriously."
26:19;26:24;"Like, for the NBA to just suspend all games"
26:24;26:27;"as soon as they heard one player had been diagnosed,"
26:27;26:29;"like, good, perfect."
26:29;26:30;"And like I said,"
26:30;26:32;"watching it from the perspective of the music industry"
26:32;26:35;"where, you know, literally one week ago,"
26:35;26:36;"people were saying,"
26:36;26:39;"""Well, they cancelled one festival in Florida,"
26:39;26:41;"but your festival's still on."""
26:41;26:45;"You know, and like kind of bargaining that way"
26:45;26:48;"to a week later hearing about Coachella,"
26:48;26:51;"Pearl Jam, things all around the world."
26:51;26:52;"Live Nation,"
26:52;26:54;"which is one of the biggest promoters in the country,"
26:54;26:56;"has currently suspended all tours."
26:56;27:00;"So like Billie Eilish just started her arena tour,"
27:00;27:01;"her Victory Lap arena tour."
27:01;27:03;"I think she probably did two or three shows."
27:03;27:05;"Pack your [bleep] Billie."
27:05;27:08;"You're going back to Highland Park."
27:08;27:09;"[laughs]"
27:09;27:11;"There's still a few random holdouts,"
27:11;27:13;"like people are talking about,"
27:13;27:15;"like, they're still doing WWE."
27:15;27:17;"But, you know, as the weeks go on."
27:17;27:20;"Yeah, I also don't want to, like, harsh anybody out,"
27:20;27:21;"but it's going to be--"
27:21;27:23;"the next couple of weeks are going to be weird"
27:23;27:26;"in terms of just more people realizing that they're sick."
27:26;27:28;"The good news is if you have mild symptoms,"
27:28;27:30;"all you got to do is self-quarantine."
27:30;27:32;"If you're in a place that,"
27:32;27:34;"like most parts of America,"
27:34;27:37;"you don't have easy access to a test or something."
27:37;27:39;"But if you have very mild symptoms,"
27:39;27:42;"you just have to be smart not to infect anybody else."
27:42;27:44;"You know, you have to help the professionals"
27:44;27:46;"triage a little bit."
27:46;27:48;"Obviously, if you feel remotely like things are--"
27:48;27:50;"you've got serious problems breathing,"
27:50;27:52;"you know, look it all up, then you got to go."
27:52;27:54;"But in the meantime,"
27:54;27:55;"there's going to be a lot of people"
27:55;27:58;"who have very mild symptoms, even no symptoms."
27:58;28:01;"And if they stay put and don't party,"
28:01;28:02;"it should be all good."
28:02;28:05;"Have you guys heard the phrase ""super spreader""?"
28:05;28:06;"Yeah."
28:06;28:07;"That's like kids, right?"
28:07;28:10;"It's anybody who just, like,"
28:10;28:12;"spreads the disease to a [bleep] load of people."
28:12;28:14;"Like, there's, like, a model"
28:14;28:16;"who's, like, the super spreader of the fashion world."
28:16;28:18;"There's a big outbreak in Milan,"
28:18;28:20;"and it was right during fashion week."
28:20;28:23;"So, you know, a few models, fashion people,"
28:23;28:25;"become super spreaders."
28:25;28:26;"They come home."
28:26;28:28;"They're hitting the gym,"
28:28;28:31;"hitting the, uh, acai bowl place."
28:31;28:33;"And I bet maybe for whatever reason,"
28:33;28:34;"some people also just, like,"
28:34;28:36;"they have no symptoms, and they're just, like,"
28:36;28:39;"the virus really just, like, goes to town on their body."
28:39;28:40;"They're just super spreaders"
28:40;28:42;"spreading that [bleep] all over the place."
28:42;28:44;"20, 30, 40 people."
28:44;28:45;"This is why we're doing this remotely."
28:45;28:48;"I didn't want to be a super spreader for the TC crew."
28:48;28:50;"I don't know if I have it."
28:50;28:51;"I'll never know."
28:51;28:54;"But mild symptoms."
28:54;28:56;"Yeah, well, hopefully that's that."
28:56;28:57;"Yep."
28:57;28:59;"I mean, there's even one school of thought."
28:59;29:01;"Like, some people wondering,"
29:01;29:03;"is it possible that coronavirus has been in the U.S.,"
29:03;29:05;"like, way longer than people think?"
29:05;29:06;"I think it has."
29:06;29:08;"It's kind of been a harsh flu season."
29:08;29:10;"A lot of doctors and stuff,"
29:10;29:12;"and anecdotally, people have been saying"
29:12;29:14;"this is an unusually harsh flu season."
29:14;29:16;"So is it possible there have been people"
29:16;29:18;"all around the country who, in December and January,"
29:18;29:20;"were just like, ""Holy [bleep], man."
29:20;29:22;"""I haven't had a flu like that in a decade."
29:22;29:23;"Knock me on my ass."
29:23;29:24;"I felt better after about a week."""
29:24;29:27;"Like, maybe they just had the novel coronavirus."
29:27;29:28;"I think we know someone."
29:28;29:32;"I think Hannah had it, or we think Hannah had it."
29:32;29:33;"And when was that?"
29:33;29:35;"Okay, right after Sundance."
29:35;29:36;"Ooh."
29:36;29:37;"She went to Sundance."
29:37;29:38;"So is that January?"
29:38;29:40;"Late January."
29:40;29:41;"And do you remember, actually,"
29:41;29:44;"there was a TC episode that we had to postpone a day"
29:44;29:46;"because she was in urgent care?"
29:46;29:47;"Yes."
29:47;29:49;"So that was that episode."
29:49;29:51;"I met her in urgent care,"
29:51;29:53;"and she tested negative for flu,"
29:53;29:57;"but had, like, very intense respiratory problems."
29:57;29:58;"And, of course--"
29:58;30:00;"I think it was steroids for the health of breathing."
30:00;30:02;"And then a really intense cough,"
30:02;30:06;"and then really, really intense body aches."
30:06;30:10;"And she was like, ""I have not been this sick in, like, 10 years."""
30:10;30:12;"I've heard a lot of stories like that,"
30:12;30:14;"and a lot of it happened in January,"
30:14;30:16;"before anybody in the U.S.--"
30:16;30:18;"Well, people were talking about coronavirus"
30:18;30:20;"as related to Wuhan in China,"
30:20;30:22;"but before anybody was talking about it,"
30:22;30:24;"like, particularly spreading here or being a big deal."
30:24;30:26;"So who knows?"
30:26;30:27;"Well, yeah."
30:27;30:28;"And then, well, then, you know,"
30:28;30:31;"with the Washington State cases, it emerged that"
30:31;30:35;"it had been around for six weeks prior to being discovered,"
30:35;30:36;"which puts that--"
30:36;30:39;"And that story was, you know, a week or two ago,"
30:39;30:41;"so that puts us right back into late January."
30:41;30:44;"So it totally would make sense that, like--"
30:44;30:47;"And Sunday, it seems like a complete breeding ground"
30:47;30:49;"for that kind of thing."
30:49;30:51;"People coming from all over the world."
30:51;30:52;"Yep."
30:52;30:56;"People flying cramped planes, cramped hotel rooms."
30:56;30:57;"You know what else?"
30:57;30:58;"A lot of glad-handing."
30:58;31:00;"Ton of glad-handing."
31:00;31:02;"So I might have had corona--"
31:02;31:05;"I might have had corona back in, like, early February."
31:05;31:07;"Did you get knocked on your ass, too?"
31:07;31:09;"I didn't get knocked on my ass, but I did have, like--"
31:09;31:10;"She was really sick."
31:10;31:14;"I kind of, like, felt kind of crappy for a few days."
31:14;31:16;"Kind of like how I do now."
31:16;31:17;"Well, yeah, just 'cause you get it once"
31:17;31:18;"does not necessarily--"
31:18;31:20;"unfortunately doesn't necessarily mean you can't get it twice, but--"
31:20;31:23;"See, I've heard mixed findings on that."
31:23;31:24;"Right."
31:24;31:26;"Yeah, I guess nobody actually knows what they're talking about."
31:26;31:27;"None of us do."
31:27;31:29;"It's like, maybe, maybe not."
31:29;31:31;"Do you have the antibodies or don't you?"
31:31;31:34;"So you were thinking to yourself, all right,"
31:34;31:37;"my wife caught a bug at Sundance,"
31:37;31:40;"really took her down, she got what she needed."
31:40;31:42;"I got it a little bit, too."
31:42;31:43;"Felt a little [bleep]"
31:43;31:45;"but then it felt normal."
31:45;31:48;"And then when the corona story slowly started"
31:48;31:50;"in the United States, like, when was that?"
31:50;31:52;"End of February?"
31:52;31:54;"Or mid-February?"
31:54;31:55;"Anyway, it was--"
31:55;31:58;"We were just like, ""Whoa, maybe you had corona."""
31:58;32:00;"Anyway, it was gnarly."
32:00;32:03;"Tom Hanks, also a super spreader."
32:03;32:07;"Did you guys see Chet's message to the fans?"
32:07;32:08;"Oh, yeah."
32:08;32:10;"Chet Hayes is a real legend."
32:10;32:11;"Yeah."
32:11;32:13;"For people who don't know, he's Tom Hanks'--"
32:13;32:14;"He looked buff."
32:14;32:15;"He's Tom Hanks' rapper son."
32:15;32:16;"He's in great shape."
32:16;32:19;"He's got a killer body, a lot of tattoos."
32:19;32:21;"And I've been following his career for a long time."
32:21;32:24;"I'm glad that we can kind of steer this back to music world,"
32:24;32:27;"which really is our forte here at Time Crisis."
32:27;32:30;"'Cause I remember there was a wave--"
32:30;32:31;"When would this have been?"
32:31;32:33;"Five or six years ago, maybe more,"
32:33;32:37;"where a lot of prominent Caucasian actors' sons"
32:37;32:39;"were pursuing rap."
32:39;32:42;"I love dynasties, and I love rap,"
32:42;32:44;"so I was kind of, like, really struck by it."
32:44;32:46;"And the two biggest ones were Chet Hayes,"
32:46;32:48;"who's Tom Hanks' son, and I believe--"
32:48;32:52;"He first came on my radar when he was an undergrad"
32:52;32:54;"at Northwestern."
32:54;32:55;"Okay."
32:55;32:57;"You familiar with the school in Chicago,"
32:57;32:58;"or just outside Chicago?"
32:58;32:59;"Sure."
32:59;33:00;"It's a major school."
33:00;33:01;"I've heard of it."
33:01;33:03;"I think they have, like, a really good school journalism."
33:03;33:05;"I'm not sure what Chet was studying,"
33:05;33:07;"but he made a song--"
33:07;33:10;"At the time, the Wiz Khalifa song ""Black and Yellow,"""
33:10;33:12;"which is about the Pittsburgh colors--"
33:12;33:14;"Wiz Khalifa's from Pittsburgh, and, you know,"
33:14;33:16;"the Penguins and all the teams--"
33:16;33:17;"Pirates."
33:17;33:18;"The Pirates, they use black and yellow."
33:18;33:20;"So Wiz Khalifa had the song that goes,"
33:20;33:22;"♪ Black and yellow, black and yellow, uh-huh ♪"
33:22;33:24;"♪ You know what it is, everything I do ♪"
33:24;33:26;"♪ I do a big-- ♪"
33:26;33:29;"And so Chet Hayes, being an undergrad at Northwestern,"
33:29;33:32;"whose colors are black and purple,"
33:32;33:35;"he saw an opportunity to make a song--"
33:35;33:36;"I don't know if SoundCloud was around yet,"
33:36;33:40;"but he kind of self-released a kind of Northwestern pride song"
33:40;33:44;"that went, ♪ Black and purple, black and purple, black and purple ♪"
33:44;33:45;"Sounds tight."
33:45;33:46;"I always love a human interest story."
33:46;33:49;"Tom Hanks' son getting in the music game."
33:49;33:50;"I like that."
33:50;33:52;"And I was like, ""You know what, man?"
33:52;33:56;"That's a pretty cool way to flip the Wiz Khalifa song."""
33:56;33:58;"Let me see if I can find the lyrics to it."
33:58;34:00;"♪ So be true to your school ♪"
34:00;34:02;"♪ Class is to say good-bye ♪"
34:02;34:05;"♪ Just like you would to your girl or guy ♪"
34:05;34:08;"♪ Be true to your school now ♪"
34:08;34:12;"♪ Now that your colors fly ♪"
34:12;34:18;"♪ Be true to your school ♪"

34:21;34:24;"♪ I got perfect on track ♪"
34:24;34:26;"♪ I'm proud of where I'm at with my crews around ♪"
34:26;34:30;"♪ The other parts of the town, I got a decal in back ♪"
34:30;34:34;"♪ So be true to your school now ♪"

34:44;34:50;"♪ Be true to your school ♪"
34:50;34:53;"You're listening to..."
34:53;34:57;"Time Crisis on BEAST1."
34:57;35:00;"So he changed his name from Hanks to Hayes."
35:00;35:04;"It sounds like a country singer, Chet Hayes."
35:04;35:08;"It sounds like a country singer with just a little bit of hip-hop."
35:08;35:11;"It's very like the past couple years."
35:11;35:13;"Yeah, the Chet needs a country."
35:13;35:16;"♪ And do the Chet Hayes ♪"
35:16;35:18;"[laughing]"
35:18;35:21;"♪ I'm smoking weed in my truck, do the Chet Hayes ♪"
35:21;35:24;"Yeah, like trap beat, just kind of like..."
35:24;35:27;"We're mixing hip-hop and country, man. Chet Hayes, you know?"
35:27;35:29;"Why they call you Chet Hayes?"
35:29;35:31;"Well, Chet, that's my given name."
35:31;35:35;"And they call me Chet Hayes because I, you know, I'm just hotboxing my F-150."
35:35;35:39;"I'm just in a whole haze of marijuana smoke, you know?"
35:39;35:41;"I'm Chet Hayes."
35:41;35:44;"Oh, wait, excuse me. I was wrong about the Northwestern colors."
35:44;35:47;"They're not black and purple. They're white and purple."
35:47;35:50;"So he says, ""These are the opening lines."
35:50;35:52;"White and purple, white and purple, white and purple."""
35:52;35:56;"And then he says, ""White kicks, purple kush."
35:56;35:59;"This is college hitting blunts after hitting books."""
35:59;36:01;"Not bad. I dig it."
36:01;36:04;"I made some rap songs in college. I'm not trying to shame him."
36:04;36:08;"""Hear the neighbors talk, but you know that they be losing."
36:08;36:11;"I'm trying to walk the walk for the major of my choosing."""
36:11;36:13;"Okay."
36:13;36:15;"Okay, so he's like-- it's cheeky. He's having fun."
36:15;36:17;"It's like not too self-serious."
36:17;36:19;"When that song came out, I was very interested in it."
36:19;36:24;"Around that time, Daniel Day-Lewis' son, Gabe Day-Lewis,"
36:24;36:29;"also released a rap video and I think maybe a whole mixtape."
36:29;36:31;"And this was right around the time, and I was kind of like,"
36:31;36:33;"""Wow, this is kind of an interesting trend."""
36:33;36:36;"And not just any actors, you know?"
36:36;36:42;"These are like maybe two of the most respected Caucasian actors ever."
36:42;36:45;"I mean, especially when you don't count the Italians,"
36:45;36:48;"because the Pacinos, the De Niros, the DiCaprios,"
36:48;36:50;"they're some of the biggest actors."
36:50;36:54;"So if you don't count the Italians, you got Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks,"
36:54;36:56;"and Daniel Day-Lewis."
36:56;36:58;"Those are the big three, I would say, of kind of white,"
36:58;37:02;"non-Italian white guys of that generation doing their thing in the acting game."
37:02;37:04;"So, you know, I'm a trend spotter, so I was like,"
37:04;37:06;"""That's interesting. Both these guys' sons are rapping."""
37:06;37:09;"And Gabe Day-Lewis, he was much younger. I think he was still in high school."
37:09;37:13;"And he put out a rap song, and I remember I was very interested in that, too."
37:13;37:15;"I remember he took a lot of heat."
37:15;37:18;"People were criticizing it, getting some haters."
37:18;37:22;"And I remember about six months later, I looked for it to show somebody,"
37:22;37:25;"and it had almost been scrubbed from the internet."
37:25;37:29;"Like Seinfeld. Maybe you can do a deep dive and see if you can find it."
37:29;37:30;"You think he took it down?"
37:30;37:34;"Maybe he got, you know, it's hard out there for us artists."
37:34;37:36;"You know, you got a lot of opinions."
37:36;37:38;"You got your lovers, you got your haters."
37:38;37:42;"Maybe he was a little young to, you know, take all that in."
37:42;37:46;"And maybe he said, ""Dad, I got myself in a sticky situation, man."
37:46;37:48;"I was just trying to share my hip-hop with the world,"
37:48;37:52;"and now I got people making fun of me, and they're even dragging your name into it, Dad."""
37:52;37:55;"And Daniel Day-Lewis, he's a very powerful man."
37:55;37:58;"He says, ""Don't worry, I'll get this sh*t done."""
37:58;38:00;"And he calls him like a Hollywood fixer type, and he's like,"
38:00;38:02;"""You get this sh*t off the internet."""
38:02;38:05;"I mean, Seinfeld, what do you sing? Are you doing a live search right now?"
38:05;38:09;"I am, yeah. I mean, well, I can tell that Chet Hayes'--"
38:09;38:12;"some of his early hits have definitely been removed from the internet."
38:12;38:15;"But I think Chet Hayes continues to own it and rap."
38:15;38:18;"I think Gabe Day-Lewis kind of pivoted to being--"
38:18;38:21;"I don't know if he still makes music, but he definitely models now."
38:21;38:23;"And maybe he was like, ""You know what? I don't need this whole--"
38:23;38:26;"I don't need all the drama of being a rapper. I just want to be a model,"
38:26;38:31;"and I don't know, maybe make some more, like, tasteful folk rock or something."""
38:31;38:36;"Yeah, I mean, in terms of an artist who's going to face an uphill battle"
38:36;38:39;"in terms of audience goodwill, being a young rapper"
38:39;38:42;"and the son of a very famous actor would be hard."
38:42;38:44;"Yeah. And I feel like--"
38:44;38:46;"You know what I mean? You're facing an uphill battle there."
38:46;38:48;"And Chet Hayes--"
38:48;38:49;"It's a funny irony."
38:49;38:51;"You know what? I think it's changing all the time."
38:51;38:55;"I think, you know, Drake, he's not the son of a famous actor,"
38:55;38:59;"but even the fact that he's this Canadian guy who was a child actor,"
38:59;39:01;"and the fact that he went on to become one of the biggest rappers in the world,"
39:01;39:03;"that would have been totally unheard of."
39:03;39:07;"And he kind of, like, eventually earned a type of credibility."
39:07;39:11;"So, you know, it wouldn't shock me at the way things are trending,"
39:11;39:14;"you know, if maybe five, ten years from now,"
39:14;39:17;"maybe there's a younger actor now who doesn't have a kid."
39:17;39:20;"I think in our lifetimes, you know, maybe Timothee Chalamet,"
39:20;39:25;"he might have a young son who raps, and by that point, people will just be like,"
39:25;39:29;"""He won't maybe face the same scrutiny as a Gabe Day-Lewis."""
39:29;39:34;"It does look like Gabe Day-Lewis pivoted from rap in 2016,"
39:34;39:41;"and he released an acoustic album called ""Every Scar Is A Healing Place."""
39:41;39:43;"And he doesn't rap on it."
39:43;39:46;"Doesn't rap on it. It's acoustic soul."
39:46;39:49;"And he's got a SoundCloud."
39:49;39:52;"I'm just trying to see if that's still up."
39:52;39:56;"Yeah, there are a couple tracks on there, it seems."
39:56;39:59;"Two songs off it on SoundCloud."
39:59;40:02;"""Ink In My Veins"" and another one called ""True."""
40:02;40:05;"So maybe he was just trying to find himself musically."
40:05;40:09;"Sure. Well, look, again, I'm not hating, because I'm somebody,"
40:09;40:14;"I've always loved rap. I've enjoyed, I love writing lyrics."
40:14;40:17;"And there's a time in my life where I was like, well, hip-hop's like the most lyrical art form"
40:17;40:22;"and the most inspiring. I kind of felt like, is this what I should be doing?"
40:22;40:28;"And, you know, eventually, I realized, no, it's not."
40:28;40:31;"Is this the Gabe Day-Lewis?"
40:31;40:33;"Oh, this is Gabe Day-Lewis?"
40:33;40:38;"Okay, it's more like a pop track."
40:38;40:43;"Whoa."
40:43;40:44;"Not a bad voice."

41:01;41:05;"Not bad at all, man. All right. I'm not mad at that."
41:05;41:08;"Now, so I think Gabe Day-Lewis, he pivoted relatively quickly,"
41:08;41:12;"whereas Chet Hayes, he came on the scene with ""White and Purple"""
41:12;41:16;"rapping about Northwestern, and then he made some pretty serious mistakes."
41:16;41:20;"I believe he had a whole thing where not only did he say the N-word,"
41:20;41:23;"he defended it on some sort of strange grounds."
41:23;41:29;"I think maybe his reasoning was that he's really down with the culture,"
41:29;41:30;"something like that."
41:30;41:34;"Have you heard his new Jamaican..."
41:34;41:39;"I mean, he's been doing these Instagram videos in a Jamaican accent."
41:39;41:42;"I've heard about this, and I've actually heard from Jamaican people"
41:42;41:45;"that they're like, ""You know what? He does the accent pretty well."""
41:45;41:47;"And look, maybe you're the son of a great actor."
41:47;41:50;"You're probably going to be pretty good at accents and putting on voices"
41:50;41:52;"and things like that."
41:52;41:56;"Maybe he's just rehearsing for an acting gig."
41:56;41:57;"Maybe."
41:57;42:02;"Maybe like a Miami Vice reboot, he plays an undercover cop or something."

43:12;43:14;"Rest in peace. Yeah."
43:14;43:15;"Yeah, rest in peace."
43:15;43:17;"I feel like there's got to be another one."
43:17;43:19;"I think there'll be more and more in the future."
43:19;43:22;"But anyway, so I've known about Chet Hayes for a long time."
43:22;43:25;"He's definitely made some mistakes, but, you know,"
43:25;43:27;"he's made some interesting music, too."
43:27;43:30;"And he helps kind of spread the word about"
43:30;43:32;"what his parents are going through."
43:32;43:35;"But look, it's going to be a big question here in Hollywood"
43:35;43:37;"because everybody loves Tom Hanks,"
43:37;43:39;"and so that made a really big splash."
43:39;43:41;"And they hear about, ""Okay, this guy's got coronavirus."""
43:41;43:43;"You hear it's not serious, good, but still,"
43:43;43:45;"you're going to be thinking about him."
43:45;43:47;"He's one of America's sweethearts."
43:47;43:49;"And then the question is, well, he's in Australia."
43:49;43:52;"Did he get it in Australia, or did he get it"
43:52;43:54;"at a Beverly Hills luncheon?"
43:54;43:55;"And he's Tom Hanks."
43:55;43:56;"He's going to be glad--"
43:56;43:58;"People are going to be coming up to him left, right, and center,"
43:58;44:00;"just like, ""Tom, how the hell are you? Put a there."""
44:00;44:02;"People probably say, ""How the hell are you?"
44:02;44:05;"Put a there to Tom Hanks 100 times a day."""
44:05;44:08;"- Oh, yeah. - He's shaking so many hands."
44:08;44:10;"He's glad-handing. I mean, you know, and again,"
44:10;44:12;"this is actually-- it's serious."
44:12;44:14;"People have been wondering about the presidential candidates."
44:14;44:17;"These guys are glad-handing like a mother[bleep]"
44:17;44:20;"out there on the road, all sorts of people, you know?"
44:20;44:22;"Even if you wash your hands, still, like,"
44:22;44:24;"you're being exposed."
44:24;44:26;"Yeah, and they're old as hell."
44:26;44:27;"And Trump, too."
44:27;44:30;"I truly wonder if we'll have an election this year."
44:30;44:31;"I'm not trying to be alarmist."
44:31;44:33;"I'm just, like, kind of thinking out loud, like,"
44:33;44:35;"will we-- you know, just a week ago,"
44:35;44:40;"people didn't think they would seriously suspend the NBA season,"
44:40;44:43;"postpone Coachella, cancel every--"
44:43;44:45;"essentially every large concert happening,"
44:45;44:46;"and now we're here."
44:46;44:48;"So are there things later in the year"
44:48;44:51;"that currently seem unthinkable that could happen?"
44:51;44:54;"- Yeah. - Such as postponing the election?"
44:54;44:56;"I mean, aren't there more primaries, like, on Tuesday?"
44:56;44:59;"I mean, I don't even understand how they can, like, count them."
44:59;45:01;"It's going to be weird as hell."
45:01;45:02;"Yeah."
45:02;45:04;"And there's a debate, right, on Sunday?"
45:04;45:06;"- Yep. - Biden and Bernie."
45:06;45:07;"Like, it's going to be--"
45:07;45:10;"there's going to be no audience for it, I assume."
45:10;45:12;"It's going to be weird."
45:12;45:14;"Could you imagine voting?"
45:14;45:17;"Could you imagine going out and standing in line to vote?"
45:17;45:19;"- On Tuesday? - Absolutely not."
45:19;45:20;"No, absolutely not."
45:20;45:22;"Even if you're not personally scared,"
45:22;45:24;"just you're getting so much messaging"
45:24;45:27;"from intelligent people saying, like, don't be in crowds,"
45:27;45:29;"don't go places unless it's essential,"
45:29;45:33;"like, no, a lot of people are not going to feel comfortable voting."
45:33;45:34;"It's going to be really weird."
45:34;45:38;"So, you know, again, my hope is that the human suffering"
45:38;45:41;"in terms of, you know, death and pain and scarring"
45:41;45:43;"and all these bad things that the virus can cause,"
45:43;45:47;"I really hope that that can be minimized and controlled,"
45:47;45:52;"but even so, there's going to be weird vibes all year."
45:52;45:54;"So I think we all have to mentally prepare for that."
45:54;45:55;"Man."
45:55;45:57;"So, you know, maybe, Jake, you got to make"
45:57;46:01;"a special Tasteful Palate of the '70s playlist for 2020."
46:01;46:03;"- Because I got to say-- - A healing list."
46:03;46:05;"A healing list."
46:05;46:08;"Because, yeah, you can kind of take the best of all your playlists"
46:08;46:10;"where you got a little bit of New Age,"
46:10;46:14;"a little bit of The Eagles, a little Dead, a little Rod Stewart."
46:14;46:16;"Because I got to say, the--"
46:16;46:17;"Peaceful, easy feeling."
46:17;46:19;"I really think that America needs"
46:19;46:21;"the Tasteful Palate of the '70s right now"
46:21;46:24;"because there's something about, like,"
46:24;46:27;"new, innovative, futuristic music"
46:27;46:29;"that when you're in a certain mood,"
46:29;46:32;"it feels like that's the direction you want to go in,"
46:32;46:36;"but we're hitting this giant roadblock as a society right now."
46:36;46:38;"And I think, you know, there's a lot of old wisdom"
46:38;46:40;"in some of that old music,"
46:40;46:43;"and you want to hear some of those Tasteful analog sounds."
46:43;46:45;"And actually, you know, the mind-body connection--"
46:45;46:49;"I was watching a Marianne Williamson"
46:49;46:51;"coronavirus meditation video last night."
46:51;46:52;"Cool."
46:52;46:53;"It was right before I went to sleep."
46:53;46:55;"It was recommended to me by YouTube,"
46:55;46:57;"and they have very sophisticated algorithms,"
46:57;46:59;"so they clearly thought that I needed to see it."
46:59;47:01;"So I started watching Marianne Williamson"
47:01;47:05;"talking about coronavirus hitting,"
47:05;47:07;"and she was like, ""Don't scoff at the mind-body connection."""
47:07;47:09;"And I'm with her on that, you know?"
47:09;47:12;"Might sound a little hippy-dippy, but I'm with her."
47:12;47:14;"The research backs it up."
47:14;47:17;"It sounds hippy-dippy, but, you know, a lot of stuff."
47:17;47:19;"You know, the mind-body connection, it's real."
47:19;47:21;"So then she starts going into a meditation."
47:21;47:23;"I fell asleep in about two minutes."
47:23;47:26;"That might have been my body taking her messaging"
47:26;47:27;"and putting it to use."
47:27;47:29;"I probably just needed some sleep."
47:29;47:33;"But look it up if you're a Marianne Williamson fan."
47:33;47:34;"Then I woke up the next day,"
47:34;47:36;"and I started thinking about the mind-body connection, man."
47:36;47:38;"I'm like, ""You know what?"
47:38;47:39;"When you're sitting at home,"
47:39;47:41;"we all got to really make sure,"
47:41;47:43;"especially because the number one thing"
47:43;47:45;"that a lot of people sitting at home are going to do"
47:45;47:47;"is spend a lot of time on the internet."""
47:47;47:49;"-Yep. -And there's--"
47:49;47:51;"I hate to say it, and guys,"
47:51;47:52;"just tell me if I'm going too far,"
47:52;47:54;"but there's a lot of bad vibes on the internet."
47:54;47:55;"That's my take."
47:55;47:57;"-Scathing take."
47:57;48:02;"-Social media, YouTube comments section, 4chan."
48:02;48:04;"There's a lot of bad vibes on the internet."
48:04;48:07;"-Even just streaming terrible reality shows"
48:07;48:09;"on Netflix all day is not good"
48:09;48:11;"for the mind-body connection."
48:11;48:12;"-No, totally."
48:12;48:14;"I think now's the time, and I feel it, too."
48:14;48:16;"You know when there's a lot of news happening"
48:16;48:18;"and you get a little bit addicted to your phone?"
48:18;48:19;"Sometimes I put my phone down,"
48:19;48:22;"and I swear I feel like my brain is jumbled."
48:22;48:23;"-Oh, yeah."
48:23;48:24;"-You know what I mean?"
48:24;48:25;"I was actually talking to my boy--"
48:25;48:29;"I mean, none of this is particularly novel as it takes."
48:29;48:31;"People have said this in so many words for decades now,"
48:31;48:33;"but I was talking to my boy about that feeling"
48:33;48:35;"of just brain jumbledness"
48:35;48:37;"when you're on Twitter too long,"
48:37;48:40;"and he's somebody who's a hardcore Bernie supporter,"
48:40;48:42;"and he found the last couple weeks very stressful"
48:42;48:44;"and just constantly looking at info."
48:44;48:46;"And he was talking about the feeling"
48:46;48:49;"that he's had many times"
48:49;48:51;"where he's looking at Twitter"
48:51;48:52;"and being, like, harshed out"
48:52;48:54;"and be, like, looking at some sh--"
48:54;48:55;"that he doesn't like,"
48:55;48:56;"and his brain goes,"
48:56;48:57;"""Man, enough of this bullsh--."
48:57;48:59;"I wonder what's happening on Twitter."""
48:59;49:01;"And then he opens another tab of Twitter."
49:01;49:02;"[ Laughter ]"
49:02;49:03;"-Wow."
49:03;49:04;"-And that's some real sh--."
49:04;49:06;"I mean, certainly everybody's familiar"
49:06;49:09;"with getting kind of stuck in the app loop"
49:09;49:10;"where you're just like,"
49:10;49:11;"""Oh, yeah, I want to look something up."""
49:11;49:12;"And the next thing you know,"
49:12;49:14;"you've opened and closed Instagram five times."
49:14;49:16;"You're like, ""Instagram, email, text,"""
49:16;49:17;"you know, like, you do that thing."
49:17;49:18;"We've all done that."
49:18;49:20;"-New York Times, Twitter, Instagram."
49:20;49:21;"-Yep."
49:21;49:22;"And a couple times recently"
49:22;49:25;"when I've, like, really spent some deep time reading,"
49:25;49:26;"like, a paper book,"
49:26;49:28;"I really did feel like my brain"
49:28;49:30;"settled into, like, a different wavelength."
49:30;49:32;"And not even 'cause of the content of the book."
49:32;49:33;"You know what I mean?"
49:33;49:34;"-I totally do."
49:34;49:35;"I was reading a novel."
49:35;49:38;"I was reading the new Michelle Welbeck novel"
49:38;49:40;"this afternoon on the couch."
49:40;49:42;"Made the point of just, like, really, like,"
49:42;49:45;"""I'm going to pound out a few hundred pages on this book."""
49:45;49:46;"And it's a book about --"
49:46;49:50;"It's sort of like a classic, like, French existentialist novel"
49:50;49:52;"about, like, the meaninglessness of contemporary life."
49:52;49:56;"And this guy's, like, a middle manager from Monsanto."
49:56;49:57;"-Oh, really?"
49:57;49:59;"-Yeah, it's really good."
49:59;50:01;"-Is it co-written with Neil Young?"
50:01;50:04;"[ Laughter ]"
50:04;50:06;"-Wait, is that -- -They should do an audiobook."
50:06;50:08;"-What's that book called?"
50:08;50:09;"-It's called ""Serotonin."""
50:09;50:11;"-All right, so, Michelle -- All right, yeah."
50:11;50:14;"Michelle -- I've also heard it pronounced ""Hula-beck"""
50:14;50:16;"or something, but -- -Oh, I thought it was ""Well-beck."""
50:16;50:17;"Anyway, I was just -- -That might be right."
50:17;50:18;"Who knows?"
50:18;50:20;"-I was just so into the rhythm of the book"
50:20;50:23;"and just, like, lying there and, like --"
50:23;50:25;"It sounds so dumb."
50:25;50:27;"It shouldn't be this novel an experience"
50:27;50:31;"to lie on the couch and read a book for, like, two hours."
50:31;50:34;"-No pun intended, or maybe pun intended."
50:34;50:36;"Did they originally call novels ""novels"""
50:36;50:39;"because it was, like, novel?"
50:39;50:41;"[ Laughter ]"
50:41;50:43;"Like, it was kind of like an innovative new art form,"
50:43;50:46;"and it's like, man, that's pretty novel,"
50:46;50:48;"just, like, writing a story on paper."
50:48;50:51;"That's quite a novel way to communicate, man."
50:51;50:54;"-Dude, ""Cervantes,"" man, ""Rerook,"" ""Don Quixote,"""
50:54;50:57;"that was super novel at the time."
50:57;50:59;"-Yeah, it was -- -You know, you're right."
50:59;51:03;"It derives from the Italian novella for ""new,"""
51:03;51:06;"short story of something new."
51:06;51:07;"-Which is funny, man."
51:07;51:10;"It's funny because kids today, they think of novels"
51:10;51:13;"and the whole art form as being kind of old."

54:06;54:09;"-Like, a full week is kind of crazy."
54:09;54:12;"-It's strange. It's very strange."
54:12;54:16;"But, yeah, I think, again, not to be pessimistic,"
54:16;54:19;"I think staying at home and self-quarantining"
54:19;54:20;"is a good thing,"
54:20;54:22;"and we should be optimistic"
54:22;54:23;"that people are taking it seriously,"
54:23;54:25;"but we do have to make sure"
54:25;54:27;"that us in the ""Crisis"" crew"
54:27;54:29;"and the larger ""Crisis"" community"
54:29;54:32;"are taking care of our brains and bodies."
54:32;54:33;"And I got a real problem, man,"
54:33;54:36;"because the only way that I can really get, like,"
54:36;54:39;"any exercise done is when I schlep to the gym."
54:39;54:41;"We might have to, like, conference call in"
54:41;54:44;"and, like, do some routines together."
54:44;54:46;"-Would love to. -Push-ups, sit-ups."
54:46;54:49;"And then, also, I really do believe keep the mind sharp."
54:49;54:51;"Yeah, like, I love what you're saying, Jake."
54:51;54:53;"Sit on the couch with a goal."
54:53;54:55;"I'm going to read this book."
54:55;54:57;"And, also, one thing that I've found,"
54:57;55:00;"like, sometimes I need that reset of reading books."
55:00;55:03;"Like, I might just, like, when I'm on tour or something,"
55:03;55:06;"I usually buy, like, a really heady book,"
55:06;55:09;"you know, just, like, some, like, 800-page, like,"
55:09;55:12;"critique of, you know, global capitalism-type book,"
55:12;55:14;"which is, like, Thomas, you got to --"
55:14;55:16;"-Heady. -Yeah, some [bleep] like that."
55:16;55:17;"And you, like -- I moved through that"
55:17;55:19;"at, like, a snail's pace."
55:19;55:20;"And then, sometimes, I'll just grab, like,"
55:20;55:23;"just some, like, easy-reading, like,"
55:23;55:26;"conversational, like, memoir."
55:26;55:29;"I bought Lily Allen's book when I was in England."
55:29;55:30;"I just saw it on, like, a table."
55:30;55:32;"And, you know, I've known Lily for a long time."
55:32;55:33;"I think she's cool."
55:33;55:34;"And I was just like, you know,"
55:34;55:36;"she writes in a very clear, straightforward manner."
55:36;55:39;"You just, like, hear the story over a long [bleep] life."
55:39;55:41;"And I banged that out in, like, three hours."
55:41;55:43;"Just, like, read her book cover to cover."
55:43;55:44;"And I was kind of like,"
55:44;55:48;"even if it's choosing a book that's just, like,"
55:48;55:50;"the story of somebody's life that you're interested in,"
55:50;55:52;"that I find is, like, a good way"
55:52;55:55;"just to get you back into the groove of reading."
55:55;55:58;"'Cause, yeah, being on your phone all day in the house,"
55:58;56:01;"alternating between phone, computer, and TV --"
56:01;56:02;"bad."
56:02;56:04;"-Rough stuff. -Bad odds."
56:04;56:05;"Real rough stuff."
56:05;56:08;"I guess even as far as it goes, like,"
56:08;56:11;"sometimes being on the phone and social media"
56:11;56:13;"scrambles your brain so much"
56:13;56:17;"that actually watching a full movie,"
56:17;56:20;"even on your laptop, is actually, like --"
56:20;56:22;"Even though it's still screen time,"
56:22;56:25;"it's, like, significantly more elevated screen time,"
56:25;56:27;"where at least you're focused on one thing."
56:27;56:30;"-Like, I'm gonna rewatch ""The Irishman,"""
56:30;56:32;"and I'm only gonna stop it once."
56:32;56:33;"You got to set rules."
56:33;56:35;"-Only for bathroom breaks, yeah."
56:35;56:38;"-That's what's so great about -- Oh, go ahead."
56:38;56:40;"-Well, I was gonna say, and also,"
56:40;56:41;"I know a lot of people are --"
56:41;56:44;"I'm challenging everybody to elevate their intake a little bit,"
56:44;56:46;"because this is a, you know --"
56:46;56:48;"This stuff is chicken soup for the soul, man."
56:48;56:50;"And I know a lot of people are being like,"
56:50;56:52;"""Well, what series should I binge while I'm home?"""
56:52;56:54;"And people are like, ""Oh, you should watch, like,"
56:54;56:55;"'Love is Blind'"" and, you know --"
56:55;56:56;"I watched these shows, too."
56:56;56:59;"-Don't -- I watched it. It was brutal."
56:59;57:01;"-You're very anti-""Love is Blind""?"
57:01;57:04;"-Anti, but continue -- I mean, you know --"
57:04;57:06;"-Well, look, I found it -- It's very watchable,"
57:06;57:07;"and you want to find out what happens."
57:07;57:08;"-Of course I do. -But I'm just saying,"
57:08;57:11;"so a lot of people are, like -- are saying stuff like,"
57:11;57:12;"""Oh, man, yeah, give me some, like,"
57:12;57:14;"super binge-worthy series,"" you know,"
57:14;57:15;"just to burn through."
57:15;57:19;"And sometimes when you do that, you just really become, like --"
57:19;57:20;"You get super zombified."
57:20;57:24;"And I'm, like, the kind of more, maybe, like,"
57:24;57:25;"highbrow elitist version of that,"
57:25;57:27;"which I'm gonna challenge myself to do."
57:27;57:28;"And listen, I'm not special."
57:28;57:30;"I like trash stuff just like everybody,"
57:30;57:32;"but the highbrow version is not,"
57:32;57:36;"""Give me, like, a reality show to zone out to"
57:36;57:37;"for 40 episodes."""
57:37;57:39;"It's maybe, like, work your way through"
57:39;57:43;"the catalog of a filmmaker that you're interested in."
57:43;57:44;"-Right. -You know?"
57:44;57:49;"I started watching the films of Kelly Reichardt."
57:49;57:53;"-Oh, I'm psyched to see her new movie, ""First Cow."""
57:53;57:56;"-Yeah, they better get that on the streaming service's stat, but..."
57:56;57:57;"-Yeah, they better."
57:57;57:58;"-Yeah, I was curious about that, Jake."
57:58;58:00;"I was thinking about you, 'cause people don't know"
58:00;58:02;"Kelly Reichardt is a filmmaker,"
58:02;58:04;"and she's based in Portland, Oregon,"
58:04;58:06;"where Jake used to live. -Yep."
58:06;58:09;"-And some of her best-known movies are"
58:09;58:12;"these kind of just, like, vibey,"
58:12;58:15;"slice-of-life Pacific Northwest films,"
58:15;58:18;"like ""Wendy and Lucy,"" which is Michelle Williams"
58:18;58:21;"as a woman driving to Alaska with her dog,"
58:21;58:23;"and she kind of gets stuck in a town."
58:23;58:25;"And it's, like, you know, a real slice-of-life movie"
58:25;58:26;"about, like, the hardship she faces,"
58:26;58:28;"and there's ""Old Joy,"" which is, like,"
58:28;58:31;"two buddies from college... -Yeah."
58:31;58:33;"-...going for a hike, basically."
58:33;58:35;"-Yeah. -And I like those movies."
58:35;58:37;"And then I know she's got her, like, period pieces,"
58:37;58:39;"""Meek's Cutoff,"" and I guess it's the same one."
58:39;58:40;"-Have you seen that one yet?"
58:40;58:42;"-I started watching it on the plane."
58:42;58:44;"I was like, ""You know what? This is not a plane movie."""
58:44;58:46;"-Meek's? -Just, like, holding my iPad,"
58:46;58:50;"watching, like, this very slow, like, a 3-minute shot"
58:50;58:52;"of just, like, the covered wagon"
58:52;58:54;"kind of, like, entering the frame."
58:54;58:56;"And I'm just, like, sitting there on this flight"
58:56;58:58;"watching old people open mouth cough,"
58:58;59:01;"and I'm just like, ""This is not taking my mind off [bleep]."""
59:01;59:02;"[ Laughter ]"
59:02;59:05;"-Dude, you should get baked and watch ""Meek's Cutoff."""
59:05;59:07;"-That's a baked movie?"
59:07;59:10;"-Well, the beginning is. It gets a little violent, but..."
59:10;59:12;"-Bacon Meek?"
59:12;59:14;"[ Laughter ]"
59:14;59:15;"But are you a fan, Jake?"
59:15;59:16;"Does she capture something"
59:16;59:18;"about the Pacific Northwest sensibility?"
59:18;59:20;"-Yeah, I mean, I'm a fan."
59:20;59:22;"I don't know if I can -- I can't speak to the sensibility"
59:22;59:24;"of the Pacific Northwest, but, I mean,"
59:24;59:25;"I'm definitely a fan."
59:25;59:27;"I mean, I've only seen her movies once."
59:27;59:29;"You know what? Like, I don't know them super well."
59:29;59:31;"I saw them when they came out."
59:31;59:32;"And I missed the last one."
59:32;59:34;"What is it? ""Little"" -- or ""Certain Women""?"
59:34;59:36;"Women of a Certain Age or something?"
59:36;59:38;"-Yes, something like that. ""Certain Women."""
59:38;59:40;"-I remember just loving ""Meek's Cutoff,"""
59:40;59:43;"just, like, the formal beauty of that film"
59:43;59:46;"and, like, the patience and the light."
59:46;59:47;"It's very up my alley."
59:47;59:49;"-There's something I like also about"
59:49;59:53;"working your way through a director's ""of."""
59:53;59:56;"-Yeah. -Which is that, in a sense,"
59:56;59:57;"it's like zoning out to a series,"
59:57;01:00:00;"except it triggers the slightly more critical thinking"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"part of your brain, because it's like"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"you end the film, and then you got to pause"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"and be like, go on Wikipedia and be like,"
01:00:06;01:00:09;"""So then, three years later,"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"this is what they chose to do."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"And how is it similar, and how is it different?"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"And who, you know, who did they bring along"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"for the ride? Some of the same actors."""
01:00:17;01:00:19;"It's like you're kind of walking through,"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"like, an artist's life a little bit,"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"but it requires, like, a decent amount"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"of, like, concentration and brain power"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"to go from one film to another."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Like, if you watch, like, three films in a row"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"from, like, somebody's filmography in a day,"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"that's, like, you know, exhausting,"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"but it's like you really, like, have used your brain."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"You were just like, you know, with certain filmmakers,"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"you might have just literally"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"walked through a decade with them."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"-Oh, yeah. -You know, three films back to back."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"-Who else are you thinking about watching?"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"-I was thinking about..."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"I've seen most of his movies,"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"but I might, like, start from the top"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"with David Lynch."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"-Wow. -Like, I'm a huge fan,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"but I feel like the last time I watched ""Eraserhead,"""
01:00:59;01:01:01;"which is his first movie,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"was maybe, like, I was, like, a teenager."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"-Sure. -I might have even been, like, 13 or something."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"So I'm, like, I'm such a huge fan of his."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"I've watched ""Twin Peaks"" multiple times,"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"but I'm kind of like, it would be cool"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"to, like, see the movies back to back to back."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"-What did you think of ""The Return""?"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"-I never finished watching it, but I loved it."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"I loved what... I watched maybe the first five episodes,"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"and I loved it. I thought it was vibey as hell."
01:01:25;01:01:28;"I was so, like, thrilled that Showtime"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"would spend that much money to make something"

01:01:36;01:01:38;"-Oh, sorry. Go on, Sandro."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"-Oh, just the eight-minute sequences"

01:01:48;01:01:50;"-There'd be stuff like that,"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"but then he would always drop a scene"

01:01:54;01:01:57;"He can, like, craft, like, perfect scenes"

01:05:18;01:05:20;"M-U-B-I? -Yeah."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"-That's something where you just, like -- I think on"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"the Criterion Channel, you can choose a year"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"and a country."
01:05:26;01:05:28;"That's also cool, is to be like, ""I'm gonna watch, like,"
01:05:28;01:05:30;"three movies from 1971"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"today."" That also"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"falls under the highbrow binge challenge."
01:05:34;01:05:36;"-Well, I think I'm gonna call that playlist"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"""Old Wisdom."""
01:05:38;01:05:40;"-Old Wisdom, man. -Highbrow challenge,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"Old Wisdom."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"-I think also just, like, right now is a good time"
01:05:44;01:05:46;"to, like, pull back. Our society's"
01:05:46;01:05:48;"been, uh, going full"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"throttle for a long time."
01:05:50;01:05:52;"I guess -- I guess"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"this is also --"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"this is me trying to craft -- I'm trying to craft"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"an optimistic take for the listeners"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"and for us and for -- most of all"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"for myself. But I'm like,"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"one way of thinking about"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"what's happening right now"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"and again,"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"everything I'm saying is, like, first"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"and foremost, praying for the best"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"for everybody who gets affected and has a"
01:06:14;01:06:16;"tough time with the disease,"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"which will be a lot of people. It's [bleep] up."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"But for anybody who's"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"not sick or only mildly"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"sick and just, like, kind of stuck at home, which is gonna be"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"many, many, many people,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"rather than think of it as, like,"
01:06:28;01:06:30;"""Oh, my God, things have fallen"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"into disarray,"" you can think about, like,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"our society's been, like, too full throttle for"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"a long time. This is"
01:06:36;01:06:38;"definitely a negative thing that's happening,"
01:06:38;01:06:40;"but if you're looking for the silver lining,"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"many people are being forced to"
01:06:42;01:06:44;"pause, chill,"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"and kind of, like, take stock."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"People say this all the time. ""Man, I"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"got so much to catch up on. Everybody's telling me"
01:06:50;01:06:52;"to watch this and that."" It's like,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"we don't have to live on that, like, razor's edge"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"that, like, the front"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"of the train just barreling into the"
01:06:58;01:07:00;"future, like, you know? Take a"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"moment. Dig back into that old wisdom."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Now's the time. 'Cause"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"things are gonna slow down, at least in showbiz."
01:07:06;01:07:08;"Obviously, there's still gonna be new things"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"coming out on the streaming services that they already made,"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"but things are definitely gonna slow down"
01:07:12;01:07:14;"in the live music industry. So now's the"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"time to be, like, maybe not sweat"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"being on the cutting edge quite as much."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Dig into that old wisdom of music,"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"old wisdom of film."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"The golden age of Hollywood. Have you"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"guys ever seen, like, Sunset Boulevard and, like, these"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"just, like, basic-ass, like, golden age of"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"Hollywood movies? - I've never"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"seen Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane."
01:07:32;01:07:34;"- Just watched it."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard?"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"- No, Sunset Boulevard. Citizen Kane"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"is maybe one that I don't know"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"if I've seen. Sunset Boulevard,"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"I just watched."
01:07:44;01:07:46;"- No, did you watch it? 'Cause Trump referenced it?"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"- No, no, it was pre-that."
01:07:48;01:07:50;"It was probably six months ago or something like that."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"- Oh, right. Trump was like, ""Now that's a good"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"movie."" Not like Paris. - Because that was the best"
01:07:54;01:07:56;"and weirdest movie cutout ever."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"- Yeah."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"But it is, uh, I would say"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"for the"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"binge challenge, if you haven't watched"
01:08:04;01:08:06;"it, you have to."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"It's unbelievable. - Highly recommend."
01:08:08;01:08:10;"- Highly recommend."
01:08:10;01:08:12;"Couldn't be more highly recommended."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"It's like it was made now."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"- Wow. - Yeah, you should definitely watch it."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"- It's gripping. It's not boring."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"- It's gripping. - It's boring, right?"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- No, it's not. And it's"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"weird."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"It's really good."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"- Does everybody talk like, ""Rrrr!"""
01:08:28;01:08:30;"- No, nobody does."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"- Do you have that 1940s voice, though?"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"- It does not have..."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"It doesn't have..."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"No, highly recommend."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"I think maybe Trump Kate"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"has now... Yeah, now it's sort of"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"turned it. It sort of leaves a weird taste"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"in my mouth now."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"- That's like one of those dudes, I think I've seen"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"some of his movies, but it's like, it's totally some like"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"film class thing where like an older"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"person is just like, ""I mean, Billy Wilder"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"may be the best director of all time."""
01:08:56;01:08:58;"And you're just like, ""Really?"" - Who's that?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"- He's the guy... Yeah."
01:09:00;01:09:02;"I've seen this movie,"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Double Indemnity, I think."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"He directed all these movies"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"that you've always heard of. Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"The Seven-Year Itch,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"The Spirit of St. Louis, Some Like It Hot,"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"The Apartment. - Wow."
01:09:14;01:09:16;"- He's a major dude. - I've heard all those movies and seen none of them."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"- He directed about 40"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"movies from 1929"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"until like 1970."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Time Crisis, Billy Wilder Challenge."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"[laughter]"
01:09:26;01:09:30;"We're going back to back to back to back"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"with the Billy Wilder Challenge. - God, maybe I"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"should. - Alright, I'm gonna watch"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"Sunset Boulevard. That'll be..."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"- If you're gonna watch two, watch Sunset Boulevard"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"and watch The Apartment."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"And then if you're gonna watch three, watch Double Indemnity."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"But, you certainly"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"watch The Apartment and Sunset Boulevard"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"for the Billy Wilder"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"TCU Challenge. - Okay."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"I'm doing it. I'm totally on board."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"- The last like old movie I watched, it was"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"right when Kirk Douglas died."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Somebody was like, ""You should watch The Bad and the Beautiful."""
01:09:58;01:10:00;"And it's a 1952"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"American melodrama that tells"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"the story of a film producer who alienates all around him."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"And it was one of these movies"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"where it's like,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"do I truly think it's like an excellent movie?"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"It's hard to say. But by the"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"end of it, I was just like gripped by watching"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"this like, it was just so strange."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"Watching a movie from 1952"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"that was kind of like"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"a tribute to the previous"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"30 years of Hollywood. 'Cause it's like"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"a showbiz story where all these"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"people turn their back on this like producer"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"even, and it's this kind of complicated"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"story where you keep going into the past."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"It was one of those movies where I was like, ""I'm really glad"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"I watched it."" It's also not the type"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"of movie I would hit you guys up and be like, ""Yo,"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"have you seen The Bad and the Beautiful? 1952"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Kirk Douglas vehicle?"" 'Cause I can't"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"recommend it in the same"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"way if I just saw a movie I liked. But it's"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"that same feeling of like, it's a weird"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"glimpse into"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"a bygone era. And then it's also funny"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"because that movie in 1952"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"won five Academy Awards."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"And so even that is just like this thing"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"where you're like, ""This movie meant a lot, at least"

01:12:11;01:12:13;"- Yeah, IPA."
01:12:13;01:12:14;"- All right."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"- Well, you know, one thing that I wanted to,"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"want to bring up is, it might be in bad taste,"
01:12:19;01:12:22;"but I'd be remiss not to mention this."
01:12:22;01:12:26;"When coronavirus first started hitting the news,"
01:12:26;01:12:31;"I saw a lot of tweets and jokes about Modelo virus."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- Right, didn't like that at all."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"- I mean, first of all,"
01:12:35;01:12:38;"it's not funny to joke about coronavirus,"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"but at the same time, I guess, you know,"
01:12:40;01:12:41;"you don't want to harsh people out."
01:12:41;01:12:44;"People, you know, got to deal with their stress somehow."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"So maybe a few jokes are okay."
01:12:46;01:12:50;"But Modelo virus, I mean, it's bad enough"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"what's happening to Corona, the beer brand."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Supposedly their sales are way down."
01:12:54;01:12:55;"Although I also kind of wonder"
01:12:55;01:12:58;"if just beer sales are down generally."
01:12:58;01:13:00;"You're more of a beer guy than me, Jake."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"But when I think about feeling like sick"
01:13:03;01:13:06;"or like I'm about to get sick or something,"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"beer is the last thing I want to drink."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"- Yeah, that's fair."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"- Maybe it's like from being in college or something."
01:13:13;01:13:16;"I just associate like pounding ice cold beer"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"with like getting sick."
01:13:18;01:13:19;"You know what I mean?"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"Even more than like, I don't know,"
01:13:21;01:13:23;"like tequila or wine or something."
01:13:23;01:13:26;"Just take like crushing five beers on like,"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"or maybe it's even earlier."
01:13:27;01:13:28;"It's like high school,"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"just like standing with like some like can of beer"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"in like the woods somewhere."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"I only did that a handful of times."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Just like-"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"- Dude, I got a fever coming on."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- Just like, I feel kind of sick."
01:13:40;01:13:43;"And then yeah, just being like a week of illness."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"Yeah, just like being like a kid,"
01:13:45;01:13:50;"just like crushing a few like cans of like Natty Best"
01:13:50;01:13:54;"in the woods somewhere and just being like,"
01:13:54;01:13:57;"oh, it's really cold, right?"
01:13:57;01:13:59;"- Yeah, also just like classic teenager,"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"just like totally improperly dressed."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"It's like a 90s East Coast winter."
01:14:04;01:14:05;"- Oh yeah."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"- Or no, this would be more like early 2000s for me,"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"but it's like 29 degrees."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Just like a bunch of like 16 year olds"
01:14:11;01:14:14;"holding cold beer, wearing fleeces."
01:14:14;01:14:18;"- Drinking cold beer outside when it's cold."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"- Yeah."
01:14:20;01:14:21;"- So early."
01:14:21;01:14:24;"- Yeah, so (beep) dumb, I bet,"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"I mean, hopefully kids are smarter."
01:14:26;01:14:29;"I think kids also just fit in the woods less."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"It's also funny, I don't even live near the woods,"
01:14:31;01:14:32;"but they would still find just,"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"they would still just find like woods."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Actually, the woods, I guess there's some woods,"
01:14:36;01:14:39;"but it's like where I live is like super dense,"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"New York City suburb, like town after town after town."
01:14:42;01:14:45;"But there was this like weird place that was like the woods."
01:14:45;01:14:46;"And looking back on it,"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"it couldn't have been more than like"
01:14:48;01:14:51;"one square kilometer of woods."
01:14:51;01:14:53;"'Cause I remember you entered it"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"through the parking lot of a bowling alley."
01:14:55;01:14:58;"Like you could totally just like hear cars like,"
01:14:58;01:15:01;"it's like, but it was just like,"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"that's that kind of like pathetic suburban version."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"I'm sure we got some TC heads who were just like,"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"man, us real rural kids, when we went to the woods,"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"we went to the woods."
01:15:10;01:15:13;"But it's like that kind of like suburban version"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"where it's just like, it's just enough woods"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"that you can only like, you can't see any,"
01:15:18;01:15:22;"like you can't see civilization except for like car lights."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"So you just pretend like, man, we're in the woods."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"- Yeah, it's like a half acre of woods,"
01:15:26;01:15:30;"like in between a subdivision and a strip mall."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"- I'm very familiar."
01:15:32;01:15:35;"Also those woods, like when there's like not that much woods"
01:15:35;01:15:40;"in a suburban town, weird stuff happens in those woods."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"There's like kids drinking, but also,"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"I don't know about you guys,"
01:15:42;01:15:45;"but like I can think of three different occasions"
01:15:45;01:15:50;"when I found insane amounts of pornography in the woods."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"- That's definitely a thing."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"- Is this a thing that you've like experienced?"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"- Yeah, I think part of it is that in that era,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"there was--"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"- Pre-internet, dude."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"- It was pre-internet, that's for sure."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"- Yeah."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"- And there, yeah, definitely there'd be the thing,"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"and this probably still exists to some extent"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"of just like kids leaving (beep) in the woods"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"because they need to come back."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"They need a place outside the house,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"similar for drugs or beer."
01:16:14;01:16:16;"But also in that era, and I'm sure it still exists,"
01:16:16;01:16:19;"and people, you guys tell me if I'm wrong,"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"I might be getting some dicey territory here,"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"but obviously there's always been homeless people"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"in America."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"It's always been a great shame of American society,"
01:16:26;01:16:27;"how many homeless people there are,"
01:16:27;01:16:30;"and we need to do better in terms of housing"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"and taking care of people."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"But there's a very specific figure"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"from kind of like the '80s through the 2000s"
01:16:35;01:16:38;"that probably just in terms of time passing,"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"there can't be as many of these people."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"And maybe this came from a movie,"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"but I feel like this is the thing"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"kids would always talk about,"
01:16:43;01:16:48;"which was the idea of a Vietnam vet who lived in the woods."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"You know what I mean?"
01:16:49;01:16:53;"And of course, there's always been homeless people."
01:16:53;01:16:56;"And of course, because our country is so (beep)"
01:16:56;01:16:59;"there's always been a disproportionate number"
01:16:59;01:17:01;"of vets end up on the streets"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"because they aren't taken care of"
01:17:03;01:17:06;"and that nobody's there to help them with their PTSD."
01:17:06;01:17:09;"Is this come from Rambo or something?"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"That was always this thing that kids would half joke about,"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"but I'd never be sure about that,"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"where they'd be like, ""Oh yeah, one time,"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"""my older brother and his friends, they were in the woods,"
01:17:17;01:17:20;"""and there was this weird ass Vietnam vet who lived there,"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"""and he had a whole thing."""
01:17:22;01:17:23;"It was like a thing."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"Does this ring a bell for you, Jake?"
01:17:24;01:17:28;"- Wow, that character strikes me as very tri-state."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"- The Vietnam vet in the woods?"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"- Lives in the woods."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"I don't know if you get down to Virginia,"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"you got the Vietnam vet that lives in the woods"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"or something."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"- I've never heard that one specifically,"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"but it just reminds me of, yeah,"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"like 20th century America,"
01:17:43;01:17:48;"where there'd be like every town had the one hobo"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"who was sort of the harmless hobo"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"that would sleep on the bench."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"You know what I mean?"
01:17:53;01:17:58;"That seems like a funny archetype that maybe existed."
01:17:58;01:18:02;"- This character was a little more nefarious, but also--"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"- Yeah, that's weird."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"- The reason it really stuck with me,"
01:18:04;01:18:08;"and again, this also happens a lot when you're growing up"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"and you hear all these, ""Well, my older brother,"""
01:18:10;01:18:12;"type stories, and then it happens,"
01:18:12;01:18:15;"then you're in your late 20s, early 30s,"
01:18:15;01:18:16;"and you watch a movie, and you're like,"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"""Wait a second, somebody told me this is fact once."""
01:18:20;01:18:22;"You know, like some weird story."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"So this might be one of those things."
01:18:23;01:18:25;"And I definitely can think of,"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"I'm sure this character exists in popular culture,"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"and I'm sure it's real here and there."
01:18:30;01:18:32;"I've heard really wild stories about,"
01:18:32;01:18:35;"and I guess they're not always necessarily veterans,"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"but of people who lived for decades in the woods."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"There was some guy, was it in Maine or New Hampshire?"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"There was a story of a guy who lived in the woods"
01:18:43;01:18:46;"for decades, and he only got caught."
01:18:46;01:18:49;"Basically, he wasn't even all that self-sufficient."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"He wasn't some genius hunter type dude."
01:18:51;01:18:53;"He would just kind of walk into town"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"and steal people for decades."
01:18:55;01:18:58;"I forget, for some reason, I feel like that story"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"was in Maine."
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Maybe the reason it stuck with me so much"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"is obviously there's a million different ways"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"that somebody can slip through the cracks"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"in our society to become homeless, right?"
01:19:08;01:19:09;"It could be through drugs."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"It could be just a series of decisions"
01:19:13;01:19:14;"that were out of their hands."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"It could be somebody lost their job or their family."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"There's a lot of ways that people could end up there."
01:19:18;01:19:22;"So there's something about this character,"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"the man in the woods, that always,"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"there was this baked in narrative"
01:19:27;01:19:31;"that it was somebody who felt not just let down by society"
01:19:31;01:19:34;"so they ended up on the streets, but betrayed by society"
01:19:34;01:19:35;"so they ended up in the woods."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"You know, it had this extra element."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"That's maybe why it always stuck with me."
01:19:39;01:19:42;"- Well, the Unabomber, wasn't he?"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"Ted Kaczynski? - Yeah, that."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"- Was he a Vietnam veteran?"
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- No, I don't think he served."
01:19:46;01:19:51;"He was a Harvard veteran, just like he had his intensity."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"You know, I was actually just talking about him"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"with a friend of the show, Despot."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"- Oh, who's obsessed, right? - 'Cause some people"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"might know, well, Despot owns a decent amount"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"of the Unabomber's belongings."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"- That's truly insane."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"- He's talked about it."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"It's not a secret, but I think basically,"
01:20:07;01:20:10;"for whatever reason, the FBI did an auction once"
01:20:10;01:20:14;"and I think Despot was just like, ""Sure, I'll buy a lot."""
01:20:14;01:20:16;"So he got a lot of his, you know,"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"like in the auction sense, a lot."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:20:19;01:20:24;"- And so he was posting on Instagram, on his feed,"
01:20:24;01:20:27;"he was watching a new documentary about the Unabomber."
01:20:27;01:20:30;"They'd be talking and they'd be showing,"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"doing a Ken Burns Zoom on a picture"
01:20:32;01:20:36;"of the stuff the FBI found, like a Tide box"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"that he had all these weird makeshift tools in."
01:20:38;01:20:41;"And then he would pan from his TV to his coffee table"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"to just be there."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"- Oh my God."
01:20:43;01:20:48;"- He's showing me stuff like a pair of shoes that he made,"
01:20:48;01:20:51;"where he like put like a different type of soul"
01:20:51;01:20:52;"underneath the real soul."
01:20:52;01:20:55;"So, you know, he's like a very intelligent guy."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"- Yeah."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"- So I was thinking about like him and he's, you know,"
01:20:58;01:21:01;"if you read his stuff, he did terrible things,"
01:21:01;01:21:04;"but you might agree with one or two of his ideas."
01:21:04;01:21:06;"Absolutely not the way he went about trying to implement"
01:21:06;01:21:09;"them, needless suffering and cruelty, hurting people."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"But he was like this very like,"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"we need to get back to nature, anti-technology."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"It's leading us down the wrong path."
01:21:15;01:21:17;"- Dude, old wisdom."
01:21:17;01:21:18;"- I won't go quite as far as to say the Unabomber"
01:21:18;01:21:22;"had old wisdom, but he, I was thinking."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"- He had a sprinkling of old wisdom."
01:21:23;01:21:25;"- He had a sprinkling of old wisdom."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"He messed up."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"- Big time."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"- But I couldn't help but think,"
01:21:28;01:21:31;"because this was only a few days ago"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"and I couldn't help but think, man,"
01:21:32;01:21:35;"I wonder if he's sitting life in prison."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"And I wonder if he's hearing about coronavirus"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"and being like, thank you."
01:21:39;01:21:40;"You know what I mean?"
01:21:40;01:21:43;"Like it seems like really up his alley."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"Just this idea of like, this is what happens"
01:21:45;01:21:49;"to the society that, you know, a globalized society."
01:21:49;01:21:52;"Anyway, I have a memory."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"This is also funny."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Just thinking about the figure of the,"
01:21:54;01:21:57;"I hope if TC heads, please email us."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"Did you grow up in a place where there was a story"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"of a man in the woods?"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"And I'm not talking about a man of the woods,"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"like Justin Timberlake."
01:22:06;01:22:10;"I'm talking about a man in the woods."
01:22:10;01:22:13;"And 'cause I feel like I bet we got a decent amount"
01:22:13;01:22:16;"of listeners right now being like, dude, no, totally."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"Yeah."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"- Just did a quick numbers crunch."
01:22:18;01:22:23;"And if you look up Vietnam vet lives in the woods."
01:22:23;01:22:24;"- Yeah."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"- Right off the jump."
01:22:25;01:22:28;"Vietnam veteran emerges from woods is one story."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"Other year, these are not same stories."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"A homeless vet living in the woods,"
01:22:32;01:22:36;"a 79 year old veteran lived in New Jersey in the woods."
01:22:36;01:22:39;"There's a whole organization that helps vets"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"that live in the woods."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"I think that might've been your guy."
01:22:42;01:22:47;"And then for Vietnam veterans, Florida woods are the home."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"I mean."
01:22:49;01:22:49;"- Whoa."
01:22:49;01:22:50;"- Yeah, this is."
01:22:50;01:22:53;"- I think the reason that it's like such a compelling story"
01:22:53;01:22:56;"and it's one that stays with you is because again,"
01:22:56;01:22:59;"we know people end up homeless for a lot of reasons."
01:22:59;01:23:02;"We know our society and our government doesn't do enough"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"to help homeless people."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"We also know it doesn't do enough to help veterans"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"of any war."
01:23:06;01:23:09;"But there's something about picturing that war"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"in particular, where all these Americans"
01:23:11;01:23:15;"were needlessly sent to be traumatized in the jungle"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"for something even our government barely believed in."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"And the idea that they come home,"
01:23:20;01:23:23;"they feel alienated by both sides of the political spectrum"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"or at least by the status quo."
01:23:25;01:23:29;"And that they end up, so to speak, back in the woods."
01:23:29;01:23:33;"It's like a very unique story that pertains only to that war"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"and that particular veteran experience."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"So yeah, I wonder if this is just like,"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"are there a lot of people coming back from Iraq"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"and Afghanistan living in the woods?"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Or just like, do they have a totally different set"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"of problems and responses to the problems?"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"There's something specific about Vietnam Vet in the woods"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"that's like this story."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"And as I'm talking about it,"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"when I'm picturing that little patch of woods"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"by the bowling alley in New Jersey,"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"like, and again, I wasn't like a big partier in high school,"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"but you just end up at these events here and there."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"Me with my kind of like, more like music friends"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"and like the hardcore like athletes"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"are like in a different circle, just like."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"- Really crushing, Bruce?"
01:24:09;01:24:14;"I have this memory of this girl"
01:24:14;01:24:17;"who was a one year younger than me."
01:24:17;01:24:21;"Her name was Siobhan, a real Irish Jersey girl name, Siobhan."
01:24:21;01:24:23;"And I swear I have this memory,"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"although it's one of these things,"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"like, is this like a story somebody told me?"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"But I have this memory of being in that place"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"and there being a man in the woods,"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"a type of like homeless man in the woods,"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"that type dude that was like partying with everybody."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"And I have this memory of maybe he was in a wheelchair."
01:24:41;01:24:42;"- What? - And I have this memory"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"of her like sitting on his lap."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"Or maybe that was like a story at my school."
01:24:47;01:24:48;"That's like, that was like,"
01:24:48;01:24:52;"you know, Siobhan like sat on the dude in the woods' lap"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"and they crushed Bruce together."
01:24:54;01:24:57;"- Dude, couldn't this be like a Jordan Peele movie?"
01:24:57;01:24:59;"Like man in the woods"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"and it's like some weird like war veteran"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"who's like living in the woods"
01:25:02;01:25:05;"behind like the Bed Bath and Beyond."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"(laughing)"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"- Right, well, we gotta research this"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"because I mean, definitely,"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"I think there's a Rambo movie"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"where that could be the TC Lowbrow challenge"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"is watch all the Rambo movies."
01:25:16;01:25:20;"- Dude, I mean, ""First Blood"" is like a legit good movie."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"- Is he living in the woods in that?"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Or is that like in the second one?"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"- All the other ones take place overseas, I think."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"I think the second one, he goes back to Vietnam,"
01:25:28;01:25:31;"but the first one takes place in Washington State"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"and he's visiting the widow of his buddy"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"that got killed in Vietnam."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"He has kind of long hair and stuff,"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"so he kind of looks like a hippie."
01:25:39;01:25:42;"And then the local small town sheriff is like,"
01:25:42;01:25:45;"""We don't like your kind around here, get out of here."""
01:25:45;01:25:46;"He like puts Rambo in his car"
01:25:46;01:25:48;"and like drives him to the edge of town"
01:25:48;01:25:51;"and it's just sort of like Santa Malibu deadbeat style."
01:25:51;01:25:52;"- Oh yeah, yeah, right."
01:25:52;01:25:55;"- And then Rambo is sort of like,"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"you could see it all in his face."
01:25:56;01:25:58;"He's like, ""I serve my country."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"I don't know why I'm being disrespected."""
01:26:00;01:26:03;"He turns around and starts walking back into town."
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Then the cop is like, ""What did I tell you?"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"Get the hell out of here."""
01:26:06;01:26:09;"And Rambo's like, ""No, I'm walking into town."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"I'm an American."""
01:26:10;01:26:12;"The cop's like, ""Get the hell out of here, hippie."""
01:26:12;01:26:14;"Anyway, and then all hell breaks loose."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"He goes into the woods and goes like full commando"
01:26:16;01:26:20;"on all these like small town cops in Washington."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Great movie. - Okay."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"I mean, I wonder if there's an element of truth to it."
01:26:24;01:26:28;"This idea that returning Vietnam vets were spit on"
01:26:28;01:26:33;"by hippie protesters is a very controversial idea"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"because it kind of makes the left look really bad."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"So when people bring that up in modern politics,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"people are like, ""That's an urban legend."
01:26:42;01:26:45;"No hippies were spitting on Vietnam vets"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"when they got home."""
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- Oh, I'm sure it happened."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- It sounds so harsh."
01:26:48;01:26:51;"And whether or not that actually happened,"
01:26:51;01:26:55;"I'm sure on the most basic level that there was a dude,"
01:26:55;01:26:59;"a clean cut, all American, veering right wing type dude"
01:26:59;01:27:04;"goes to Vietnam, comes back like, ""What do I even believe in?"
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Why was I sent here?"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Why was I forced to kill?"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Why did I watch?"""
01:27:07;01:27:11;"Maybe you even have some crazy dude in your battalion"
01:27:11;01:27:12;"or some (beep)"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"There are all these stories who committed war crimes."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"You might come back totally (beep) up."
01:27:16;01:27:20;"And then you come back and you have long hair like a hippie."
01:27:20;01:27:22;"And maybe you do try to hang with the hippies."
01:27:22;01:27:26;"And of course, a lot of hippies embrace returning veterans"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"and there were organizations of veterans that were anti-war,"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"but maybe you're in a town where you can't quite get down"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"with the counterculture,"
01:27:34;01:27:37;"but you're also this like shell shock, long hair dude."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"And you got the right wing conservative cop"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"also being like, ""(beep) you."""
01:27:40;01:27:41;"And maybe that is the type of (beep)"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"that makes you want to live in the woods"
01:27:43;01:27:46;"or in the case of Rambo, just like go buck wild."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"- Yeah."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"- But yeah, I'm curious if there's other movies"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"that have this archetype."
01:27:51;01:27:53;"(hip hop music)"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"- There's a comedy called ""Drill Bit Taylor"""
01:28:56;01:28:58;"with Owen Wilson."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"Did I reference this on the show before?"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"(laughing)"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"- Second time it's been referenced on television."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"- Last week."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"Didn't we talk about it last week?"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"- Maybe."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"- I got to rewatch that."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"I think maybe the big reveal in that movie"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"is that he's not a vet,"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"but in the beginning of it,"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"he's living in the woods and he's wearing like,"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"like an army jacket,"
01:29:16;01:29:20;"almost implying that he was like some special ops type dude."
01:29:20;01:29:22;"So yeah, this character definitely exists."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"And I got to,"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"you know, it's really funny too,"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"when I'm picturing this image of the girl"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"from my high school,"
01:29:27;01:29:30;"the Irish Jersey girl sitting on the lap"
01:29:30;01:29:33;"of the old vet in the woods in a wheelchair,"
01:29:33;01:29:37;"I kind of picture it almost like a David Lynch thing"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"where it's like,"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"it's like that weird kind of late eighties,"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"early nineties, indie movie slow-mo,"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"where there's like sparks coming off the fire"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"and it's all kind of like,"
01:29:45;01:29:47;"like, like hazy."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"So now I'm like,"
01:29:48;01:29:51;"is my mind recreating this like memory"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"that's really just like taking like,"
01:29:54;01:29:57;"mixing real experiences with other things."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Anyway, I want to research this further."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"Let us know if there were any men in the woods"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"where you grew up and what their backstory was."
01:30:04;01:30:08;"- Maybe this is the first scene of a movie"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"that you write someday about Jersey."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"- Jersey Rambo?"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"- Yeah, like a friend of the show, Jonah Hill"
01:30:15;01:30:18;"did that movie about kind of nineties skateboarding."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"- Mid nineties, great film."
01:30:19;01:30:22;"- Yeah, what if you did like a Jersey movie someday?"
01:30:22;01:30:25;"And just like that girl sitting on the dude"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"in the wheelchair slap, that's so deep."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"- It's almost like,"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"it's like the Jersey version of like some harmony,"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"Korean like gummo type."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"- Yeah, you could combine,"
01:30:37;01:30:40;"yeah, kind of like gummo with like spring scene"
01:30:40;01:30:44;"with like, I don't know, man, Rambo."
01:30:44;01:30:47;"- New Jersey, the year 2000, Jersey 2000."
01:30:48;01:30:50;"(laughing)"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Oh wait, so anyway."
01:30:52;01:30:53;"- How'd we get on that?"
01:30:53;01:30:57;"- That was a pretty epic rabbit hole for us"
01:30:57;01:31:00;"because we were talking about crushing brews when it's cold."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"And I always thought that up because I was talking about,"
01:31:03;01:31:05;"because I was talking about Modelo virus."
01:31:05;01:31:07;"(laughing)"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"- That's right, Modelo virus."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"- I mean, again, this might be bullshit,"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"but I've had a lot of people say"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"we should all be drinking hot beverages"
01:31:16;01:31:18;"just 'cause if you have any,"
01:31:18;01:31:19;"anytime you get sick,"
01:31:19;01:31:22;"hot beverage helps maybe kill some of the viruses"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"or bacteria in your throat and whatever."
01:31:24;01:31:27;"And you get, I'm sure you guys have got some of these"
01:31:27;01:31:30;"like a billion times forwarded emails"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"where somebody is just like,"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"I'm a virologist and I know about this (beep)"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"but anyway, I've heard people be like,"
01:31:36;01:31:39;"yeah, veer towards warm beverages or hot beverages."
01:31:39;01:31:41;"- Yeah."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"- So anyway, I guess my point was when people,"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"there's all this talk about people being like,"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"this is like the type of thing it feels like"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"a year ago, but it was only like a week ago."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"It was like, ha ha, Americans are buying less Corona"
01:31:51;01:31:53;"'cause they're scared of Corona virus."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"And I was like, maybe they're just buying less beer."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"You know, you just hear about like people getting sick."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"Do you really wanna drink any beer?"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"I bet Modelo is down too."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"- Yeah, it's winter."
01:32:04;01:32:05;"- It's not beer time."
01:32:05;01:32:07;"- It's not beer time."
01:32:07;01:32:10;"- But you know, yeah, it's funny that like teenagers"
01:32:10;01:32:12;"and college kids, it's like,"
01:32:12;01:32:14;"that they're so into like crushing cold beer,"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"maybe just 'cause it's easy."
01:32:15;01:32:18;"'Cause it's like, it's actually a really pleasant experience"
01:32:18;01:32:20;"when you're older and you like go to a dignified"
01:32:20;01:32:25;"kind of event, a cool fall or winter event"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"where people are standing outside and it's cold."
01:32:26;01:32:29;"Maybe it's a Renaissance fair and somebody gives you"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"mulled wine or something like that."
01:32:32;01:32:34;"It's actually really nice to drink a hot alcoholic beverage,"
01:32:34;01:32:35;"a hot toddy."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"- Dude, when you're sick, like hot water with honey"
01:32:38;01:32:43;"and just a little nip of whiskey, I'm in."
01:32:43;01:32:44;"I'm gonna do that tonight."
01:32:44;01:32:46;"- When we go into production with Sweet Chili Heat,"
01:32:46;01:32:49;"we should come cook up some hot,"
01:32:49;01:32:52;"straight up hot tequila drinks."
01:32:52;01:32:52;"- Oh, hell yeah."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"- Where we're just like, so it could be like"
01:32:54;01:32:55;"a hot tequila drink."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"And you know, not just,"
01:32:57;01:32:59;"you guys know Spanish better than me."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"You got caliente, but you also got picante."
01:33:01;01:33:03;"- Wait, sorry, say that again."
01:33:03;01:33:07;"- In Spanish, caliente means hot temperature."
01:33:07;01:33:09;"- Yeah, hot."
01:33:09;01:33:12;"- And picante means hot, like spicy."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"- Okay, yeah, like the picante sauce or whatever."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"- 'Cause basically what I'm proposing is-"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"- Oh, the picante is small, okay."
01:33:17;01:33:17;"- Wait, what am I thinking of?"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"Who speaks Spanish here?"
01:33:18;01:33:22;"- No, no, no, picano is small."
01:33:22;01:33:23;"- Yeah. - You're right."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"I think picante is maybe a pepper."
01:33:24;01:33:29;"- Like picaliente, like something hot and spicy."
01:33:29;01:33:32;"- Yeah, well, so I'm saying when Sweet Chili Heat takes,"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"'cause a lot of times I think an alcohol"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"really goes to the next level"
01:33:36;01:33:40;"when there's like a special drink that you do with it."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"You know, like a seven and seven."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"I'm not even totally sure what that,"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"it's like ginger ale and whiskey,"
01:33:44;01:33:47;"but you know, like then people are like,"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"you become the go-to when you have like a drink like that."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"So I think with Sweet Chili Heat tequila,"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"we gotta create, exactly."
01:33:53;01:33:57;"So we gotta create a special cocktail."
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Maybe it's called like a double hot or something"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"because it's got that little kick"
01:34:00;01:34:01;"'cause of the Sweet Chili Heat,"
01:34:01;01:34:04;"but it's also hot temperature-wise."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"And I know down Mexico way,"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"it's famously, it's a hot country."
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Although it can drop down at night down Mexico way,"
01:34:10;01:34:14;"but in the US, we want people to know,"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"like, listen, man, you know,"
01:34:16;01:34:19;"just because Time Crisis is a, you know,"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"for the most part a California-based"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"kind of laid back chill out show,"
01:34:23;01:34:26;"it doesn't mean, man, that you can't be, you know,"
01:34:26;01:34:29;"drinking Sweet Chili Heat in like Minnesota in December,"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"but we want a special double hot drink."
01:34:32;01:34:33;"I don't know what you put, you know,"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"it's almost like a mulled wine plus tequila."
01:34:35;01:34:39;"It's like a hot, hot, hot, hot tequila drink."
01:34:39;01:34:40;"- I like this."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"- That'll require some more R&D."
01:34:42;01:34:44;"- Double hot sounds pretty good."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"- There used to be a band called Hot Hot Heat, right?"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"- Yeah."
01:34:47;01:34:49;"- Yeah."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"- I'll reach out to them."
01:34:50;01:34:53;"(laughing)"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"- That would be a pretty sick drink name, Hot Hot Heat."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"- Hot Hot Heat."

01:36:16;01:36:18;"I'm going to jump off of this 'cause I'm hitting a wall."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"- You look tired, bro."
01:36:20;01:36:20;"- I'm tired."
01:36:20;01:36:24;"But I do want to say, as people self-isolate"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"and they're going to have to do this for a while,"
01:36:26;01:36:29;"I actually think that, you know, when you're home alone,"
01:36:29;01:36:34;"like this hang we just had feels really good."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"And I would encourage like TC heads"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"and like reach out to their friends"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"and have these sort of hangs."
01:36:40;01:36:42;"'Cause this was like, we just hung"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"and it was like, it was great."
01:36:44;01:36:47;"So I think, and it's going to get dark."
01:36:47;01:36:50;"I mean, you start spending like seven days, two weeks"
01:36:50;01:36:53;"where you like really aren't allowed to go hang out."
01:36:53;01:36:56;"It's going to get dark, but this actually,"
01:36:56;01:37:00;"this kind of FaceTime hang, this was it."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"And I just encourage everyone to do it."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"I think the younger generation,"
01:37:04;01:37:07;"I've noticed like people under like 25"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"or maybe under, I don't know, under 20, I don't know."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"But like young people, like kids and young adults"
01:37:12;01:37:15;"or whatever, some of these kids like live on FaceTime."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"So they're kind of used to it."
01:37:17;01:37:21;"But for that more like silverback millennial TC listener,"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"you might not have that rapport with your friends"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"where you just like FaceTime for two hours."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"I mean, I've seen this with like-"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"- I never do."
01:37:29;01:37:30;"- Yeah."
01:37:30;01:37:30;"Yeah."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"So the silverback millennials,"
01:37:31;01:37:33;"let alone the Gen X."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"So I think, you know, step outside of your comfort zone"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"and be like, hey guys, we've literally never FaceTime."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Let's start however you want to do it."
01:37:40;01:37:44;"You can do a multi, a multi-person FaceTime"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"or Google Hangout, however, you know,"
01:37:45;01:37:46;"whatever floats your boat."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"But like, yeah, especially our silverback millennials,"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"don't be scared to step into that kind of group"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"video chat world."
01:37:52;01:37:55;"- All right."
01:37:55;01:37:56;"- All right."
01:37:56;01:37:57;"Get some rest."
01:37:57;01:38:01;"- We were supposed to have Aaron Olson in the studio today"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"'cause there's a new LA Takedown record coming out."
01:38:03;01:38:04;"- Oh yeah."
01:38:04;01:38:05;"Check out that new LA Takedown."
01:38:05;01:38:08;"- Which it comes out on Friday or it came out on Friday."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"Sorry."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"- And for people who don't know,"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Aaron's a great musician."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"He's got a project band,"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"whatever you want to call it, called LA Takedown."
01:38:15;01:38:18;"That's his main thing, but he also plays in Richard Pictures."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- He plays bass in Richard Pictures."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"It was basically his idea to start the band"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"and we'll have to reschedule with him."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"- Yeah, we got to go deep with him."
01:38:27;01:38:28;"- Next time we're in studio,"
01:38:28;01:38:31;"we will get Aaron in there to talk about Richard Pictures,"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"LA Takedown."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"- And he also plays bass on most of the Mountain Brews stuff,"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"right?"
01:38:35;01:38:38;"- He plays bass on all the Mountain Brews stuff."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"- Oh, tight."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"- And he's a real legit dude."
01:38:41;01:38:42;"And for his record release show,"
01:38:42;01:38:46;"which I think was canceled or postponed until April,"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"they were going to play all Doors covers."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"- Hell yeah."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"He's a real one for that."
01:38:51;01:38:55;"Flying the flag for Jim."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"- Oh yeah."
01:38:59;01:39:01;"(birds chirping)"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"- The top five on Apple Music right now."
01:39:48;01:39:49;"- Remote top five."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"- Yeah, remote top five."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"So Colin, you said that the top five"
01:39:54;01:39:58;"on Apple Music right now is all Lil Uzi Vert."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"- What?"
01:39:59;01:39:59;"Wait, how does that work?"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"- Because right now, here's what gets tricky in this era,"
01:40:01;01:40:04;"is that Jake, when a hot new album comes out,"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"such as Lil Uzi's long awaited new album,"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"for the first week or more,"
01:40:11;01:40:15;"often the whole album will just take up the top 10 songs"
01:40:15;01:40:16;"on the streaming service."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"- I hate it."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"- Yeah, so it's not very good for internet radio,"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"but all props to him."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"But let's just listen to a little bit."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"- It makes our life very difficult."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"- Yeah, so we're not gonna do that,"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"but I do wanna, so we can switch to Billboard."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"But before that, I do wanna give Uzi his props"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"and listen to some of his music."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Jake, do you know who,"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"do you remember the name Lil Uzi Vert?"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"- I've heard the name."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"I don't know who it is."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"I don't know his music."
01:40:40;01:40:43;"- I think his biggest hit was the song"
01:40:43;01:40:43;"where the chorus went,"
01:40:43;01:40:46;"""Take me to the edge, all my friends are dead."""
01:40:46;01:40:49;"Do you remember that, the ""All my friends are dead"" song?"
01:40:49;01:40:50;"- Yep."
01:40:50;01:40:51;"- Okay, well that's him."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"But he's hugely popular."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"All right, let's hear a little bit of ""Baby Pluto."""
01:40:55;01:40:55;"Just--"
01:40:55;01:40:56;"- Baby Pluto?"

01:42:26;01:42:29;"on the Apple Music streaming charts."
01:42:29;01:42:33;"But let's take a look at what's hot on Billboard right now."
01:42:33;01:42:37;"So the number five song right now on the Billboard charts,"
01:42:37;01:42:41;"I think this is the debut on the Billboard charts right now."
01:42:41;01:42:44;"This is Lady Gaga with her comeback single ""Stupid Love."""
01:42:44;01:42:49;"And I got to shout out my boy Blood Pop."
01:42:49;01:42:52;"He worked on ""Father of the Bride."""
01:42:52;01:42:53;"He's a friend of mine."
01:42:53;01:42:55;"He's mostly known for his pop production."
01:42:55;01:42:59;"He worked on ""Sorry"" for Justin Bieber, among others."

01:43:02;01:43:04;"♪ Too late now to say sorry ♪"

01:43:09;01:43:11;"he only worked on a few songs on ""Father of the Bride,"""
01:43:11;01:43:13;"but one of my favorite ""Father of the Bride"" moments"
01:43:13;01:43:17;"is that weird kind of guitar sounding solo"
01:43:17;01:43:20;"on ""Unbearably White."""
01:43:20;01:43:22;"♪ Bam, wham, wham, wham, wham ♪"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"I've said it's not a guitar."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"It kind of sounds like some slide or pedal steel,"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"but it's Blood Pop doing his weird stuff."
01:43:28;01:43:31;"So that's him, among other things on the record."
01:43:31;01:43:32;"So anyway, he's been working hard"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"with Lady Gaga for a long time,"
01:43:33;01:43:36;"and this is the first single back called ""Stupid Love."""
01:43:38;01:43:41;"- So this is the first Gaga we've seen since ""Star is Born,"""
01:43:41;01:43:42;"huh?"
01:43:42;01:43:43;"- Exactly."
01:43:43;01:43:47;"So I think for fans, this is seen as being back to pop."
01:43:47;01:43:51;"- Right, none of this acoustic bull (beep)"
01:43:51;01:43:52;"- And it feels right."
01:43:52;01:43:55;"This sounds like what you want"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"from a Lady Gaga back to pop moment."

01:44:08;01:44:10;"Another one of our collaborations."
01:44:10;01:44:12;"- Nice Seinfeld, deep hole there."
01:44:12;01:44:13;"- Yeah."
01:44:13;01:44:14;"- Great track."

01:44:23;01:44:25;"Late 80s Madonna, specifically."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"- Yeah."

01:44:34;01:44:36;"- Wow."
01:44:36;01:44:39;"Uncanny actually, how late 80s that is."
01:44:39;01:44:42;"- I think she and Madonna have a strained relationship"
01:44:42;01:44:45;"from what I've read in the tablets."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"- Is Madonna just sort of like,"
01:44:47;01:44:50;"you're just ripping me off kind of thing?"
01:44:50;01:44:51;"- I think a little bit."
01:44:51;01:44:54;"- Didn't John Lennon kind of throw shade at the punks?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"- Oh."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"- He definitely threw shade at a lot of people."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"- I think Lennon threw shade at the punks"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"and was sort of like, come on, man."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"- I mean, a lot of those guys did."
01:45:04;01:45:05;"Jerry did too."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"- True."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"- I think the Gaga, Madonna beef"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"came from ""Born This Way,"" right?"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"- Yeah, that was a song that really sounded"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"like a Madonna song."
01:45:15;01:45:17;"But here's the thing, it's like Lady Gaga"
01:45:17;01:45:18;"is doing her own thing."
01:45:18;01:45:21;"It's like, yes, she's very indebted to Madonna."
01:45:21;01:45:22;"Maybe she just didn't kiss the ring enough,"
01:45:22;01:45:25;"but it's like, you know, Lady Gaga's got her own."
01:45:25;01:45:27;"She has her own thing, like image-wise"
01:45:27;01:45:31;"and persona-wise, but like musically, she doesn't."
01:45:31;01:45:33;"And I feel like Madonna kind of did."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"- I like Lady Gaga and I think that's a great song."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"I think that's a great comeback song."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"But I will say one thing,"
01:45:38;01:45:41;"and I'm not trying to jump into the beef."
01:45:41;01:45:42;"You know me, I'm a peaceful man."
01:45:42;01:45:44;"But I will say, it struck me many times"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"over the past like five years."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"And of course she's like very successful"
01:45:48;01:45:51;"and she does huge tours and all this stuff."
01:45:51;01:45:54;"There's like a weird air of disrespect around Madonna,"
01:45:54;01:45:59;"which doesn't befit her like iconic trailblazing status."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"- You mean in general or with Lady Gaga specifically?"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"- No, just in general."
01:46:03;01:46:06;"And look, like most artists,"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"they reach a point where they're older."
01:46:08;01:46:11;"She must be like pushing 60 now."
01:46:11;01:46:12;"- Yeah."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"- So they reach a point where they're older"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"and you know, if they don't start making"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"like tasteful jazz records, you know,"
01:46:18;01:46:19;"people are kind of like, oh my God,"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"you're still trying to do pop, you know."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"People get like, there's that kind of thing."
01:46:23;01:46:26;"And I think she's taking some chances."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"I'll be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"with her last few records, but."
01:46:29;01:46:30;"- Nope."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"- Neither have you, Jake."
01:46:31;01:46:33;"- No, I have not."
01:46:33;01:46:34;"I haven't cracked those open."
01:46:34;01:46:37;"- I would actually say it wouldn't be that out of character"
01:46:37;01:46:40;"if you were like randomly like super into Madonna."
01:46:40;01:46:40;"- No, I am."
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I think we've discussed this."
01:46:42;01:46:43;"- Oh, okay."
01:46:43;01:46:46;"- I think she has, of the last like 30 plus years,"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"of all the major pop stars,"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"the strongest catalog, hands down."
01:46:50;01:46:51;"- Oh, absolutely."
01:46:51;01:46:52;"So many good songs."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"I think we probably discussed on the show also how,"
01:46:54;01:46:57;"I think in the 80s for a few dead shows,"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Bob Weir wore a Madonna t-shirt."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Oh, wow."
01:47:00;01:47:01;"I don't think, that's news to me actually."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"- Oh, you didn't realize?"
01:47:02;01:47:05;"I'll send you a picture of Weir wearing the Madonna shirt."
01:47:05;01:47:08;"But it's really hard to like,"
01:47:08;01:47:09;"especially when you're that much older,"
01:47:09;01:47:12;"to recapture the magic of like when she was in her 20s"
01:47:12;01:47:15;"and just like changing the world as a pop star."
01:47:15;01:47:17;"Like, you know, maybe people don't,"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"I can't think of any pop star who in their 50s"
01:47:19;01:47:22;"releases many albums that people are like as excited about."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"But I just feel like there's this weird air"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"of like disrespect around her."
01:47:25;01:47:28;"And it's like, she's up there with like the Princes"
01:47:28;01:47:31;"and the Bowies and the Kanye's."
01:47:31;01:47:33;"It's like these people who had like pretty unbelievable"
01:47:33;01:47:38;"15 to 20 year runs of like changing culture and innovating."
01:47:38;01:47:42;"She really set the template for like the modern"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"Caucasian girl pop star."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"- And great songs."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"- You know, I'm not as interested in like the all,"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"like changing her image, every record,"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"like that's never really appealed to me."
01:47:52;01:47:54;"I've always just been like her song book."
01:47:54;01:47:55;"And I, you know, granted,"
01:47:55;01:47:57;"she's not writing a lot of this stuff."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"It doesn't really matter."
01:47:58;01:48:01;"Her song book is so solid."
01:48:01;01:48:03;"- No, no, but she's a real writer with collaborators,"
01:48:03;01:48:07;"but she, there's certain pop stars who like,"
01:48:07;01:48:11;"maybe the bulk of their catalog, they did not write."
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Madonna's not one of those people."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"She has a hand in all of it, as I understand it."
01:48:15;01:48:18;"Or let's say a significant percentage."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"- Sure, sure."
01:48:19;01:48:22;"- So anyway, congratulations to Lady Gaga."
01:48:22;01:48:25;"Great comeback single, but I want to talk more about this."
01:48:25;01:48:28;"Guys, let's put some more respect on Madonna's name."
01:48:28;01:48:30;"Or if you have a reason to disrespect her, I'm curious,"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"like where's it coming from?"
01:48:31;01:48:34;"But you know, she's an icon."
01:48:34;01:48:38;"- Do you remember the initial concept of Time Crisis"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"was to have people come on the show and squash beefs?"
01:48:41;01:48:44;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:48:44;01:48:45;"That'd be a big get."
01:48:45;01:48:48;"Gaga, Madonna, on TC, squashing beefs."
01:48:48;01:48:49;"- I'll just put that out there."
01:48:49;01:48:54;"Madonna, Gaga, you're both welcome to come on the program."
01:48:54;01:48:57;"Let's hash this thing out."
01:48:57;01:48:59;"We might have to bring in Elton John too."
01:48:59;01:49:01;"He famously got caught on mic."
01:49:01;01:49:03;"After they were beefing, he got caught on mic"
01:49:03;01:49:05;"talking about it with like an old friend of his"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"who was interviewing him in Australia."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"And he went on this whole thing about like,"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"oh, Madonna, like you pack it in."
01:49:11;01:49:13;"She looks terrible."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"Oh my gosh, she's embarrassing herself."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"Like let Gaga have her moment."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"And then he apologized for that."
01:49:19;01:49:20;"- Oh my God."
01:49:20;01:49:22;"- Anyway, it's funny."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"When Stupid Love came out like two weeks ago,"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"was just a very different moment than right now."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"- Yup."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"- I wonder how that'll fare."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"Yeah, like I heard Stupid Love,"
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I was like, you know, just heard it blasting out of places."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Like, you know, I was in West Hollywood,"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"which is like Lady Gaga is very popular there"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"in my experience."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"And like, just I heard it blasting out of spots"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"and like, it felt like this big moment."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"Her pop single is back,"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"but it's the kind of song that makes people wanna,"
01:49:48;01:49:52;"I think, dance, go out, exercise."
01:49:52;01:49:52;"I don't know."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"It's not a real stay at home song."
01:49:54;01:49:57;"The number four song on the Billboard charts right now,"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"this has been out since last August."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"It's Post Malone's Circles."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Do you remember this one, Jake?"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"- Kind of."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"I just saw a trailer for a new Mark Wahlberg film"
01:50:06;01:50:09;"on Netflix that Post Malone's in."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"- Oh, really?"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"The Spencer one?"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"- Could watch that in between Billy Wilder movies."
01:50:15;01:50:18;"- Wait, so this came out in August?"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"- Yeah, still crushing it."
01:50:20;01:50:35;"- Kind of a Tame Impala vibe."
01:50:35;01:50:37;"- Yeah, well, actually Post Malone described this"
01:50:37;01:50:39;"as being a Fleetwood Mac vibe."
01:50:39;01:50:41;"Which I get what he's saying."
01:50:41;01:50:44;"It's not his usual kind of trap pop."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"But yeah, totally Tame Impala."
01:50:45;01:51:03;"- Yeah, that sort of stripped down,"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"very drums forward sound of Tusk."
01:51:06;01:51:07;"- Yeah."
01:51:07;01:51:09;"- Like those Lindsey Buckingham songs on Tusk."
01:51:09;01:51:10;"- Or even just on Rumors,"
01:51:10;01:51:13;"it's got a kind of like Dreams vibe."
01:51:13;01:51:23;"This is a quote from Mark Wahlberg"
01:51:23;01:51:26;"about shooting the movie with him."
01:51:26;01:51:29;"""The day came where he was supposed to shoot a scene,"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"but they didn't even know if he was in town."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"So everybody's panicking"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"'cause musicians move to the beat of their own drum."""
01:51:34;01:51:37;"Very true, I can say from experience."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"""They don't adhere to schedules,"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"but he was in his trailer pounding Bud Lights."
01:51:41;01:51:45;"We were heading over to the real jail to shoot"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"and Post is trying to bring his 12 pack inside."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"I was like, you can't bring a 12 pack of Bud Light"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"to the jail, bro."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"It's not gonna happen."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"I said, I could probably get one beer for you"
01:51:54;01:51:56;"in a Dunkin' Donuts cup."""
01:51:56;01:51:57;"- Nice."
01:51:57;01:52:00;"- That's that real Masshole vibe."
01:52:00;01:52:01;"- Yeah, dude."
01:52:01;01:52:02;"- But where's Post from?"
01:52:02;01:52:04;"Post is from Texas."
01:52:04;01:52:07;"That's a Texas bad boy meets a Masshole."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"- That'd be a more interesting movie to me."
01:52:09;01:52:10;"Masshole versus Texan."
01:52:10;01:52:15;"Post is like, ""Bro, let me bring my Bud Light."""
01:52:15;01:52:18;"And he's just like, ""Post,"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"I could probably put it in a Dunkin' Donuts cup."""
01:52:20;01:52:23;"- Yeah, I'd much rather watch a documentary"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"about the making of that film than the actual film."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"- Totally."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"All right, let's go to the number three song."
01:52:29;01:52:31;"Oh, Dua Lipa, ""Don't Start Now."""
01:52:31;01:52:35;"Jake, do you remember who Dua Lipa is?"
01:52:35;01:52:36;"You know the name?"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"- I know the names."
01:52:38;01:52:42;"- She's an Albanian English pop star."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"She's huge."
01:52:43;01:52:48;"I've noticed people getting a little more"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"into analog sounds."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"Although, then there's that weekend song"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"that goes full 80s sense, so I don't know."
01:52:53;01:52:55;"But this is going to some classic."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"This song to me also sounds so English."
01:52:58;01:53:01;"It's just like, there's this genre of English pop disco"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"from the '90s and 2000s."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"- Yeah."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"- It's different than '70s disco."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"It's English pop disco."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"- No, it's very '90s."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"It reminds me of the Cardigans."
01:53:11;01:53:12;"Remember that band, the Cardigans?"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"- Yeah, the Grape Band."
01:53:13;01:53:21;"- Well, this part sounds very 2010s."
01:53:21;01:53:24;"But the verse was very '90s."
01:53:24;01:53:27;"- I gotta say, I've been liking everything"
01:53:27;01:53:30;"I've been hearing off of this Dua Lipa album so far."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"- Full length."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"- There's another song called ""Future Nostalgia."""
01:53:35;01:53:39;"It's kind of doing like a, almost like a spoken word,"
01:53:39;01:53:42;"like Madonna rapping on Vogue kind of thing."
01:53:42;01:53:44;"It's pretty good."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"- Now, Dua Lipa's cool."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"She's a real one too."
01:53:46;01:53:51;"She tweeted last week, basically being like,"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"please everybody vote for Bernie Sanders."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Love that."
01:53:55;01:53:56;"You know what?"
01:53:56;01:53:56;"Last time we talked about it, we were like,"
01:53:56;01:53:58;"""Why aren't all the old guys coming out?"""
01:53:58;01:54:01;"And after that, Neil Young came out and endorsed Bernie."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"- Crosby too, right?"
01:54:03;01:54:04;"- And Crosby."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"- Light endorsement."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Not an official endorsement."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"- Yeah, Neil Young was more passionate about it."
01:54:08;01:54:12;"Crosby was like, I feel like he was just kind of like,"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"yeah, just like in between being like,"
01:54:13;01:54:16;"Jim Morrison was an idiot."
01:54:16;01:54:18;"And he's like, then just like somebody asked him a question,"
01:54:18;01:54:21;"he's like, ""Y'all vote for Bernie."""
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- But anyway, seriously."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"- Jay and the Americans were a bunch of losers."
01:54:26;01:54:31;"- I met Gary Puckett once."
01:54:31;01:54:33;"It's a little (beep)"
01:54:33;01:54:35;"(laughing)"
01:54:35;01:54:40;"- Wait, Seinfeld, you reminded us recently on the TC thread"
01:54:40;01:54:44;"that you once tweeted at David Crosby,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"asking him what he thought of Vampire Weekend."
01:54:46;01:54:49;"- Yeah, I'm trying to find that."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"- And what did he write?"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"- Wasn't it like, ""What's that?"""
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Or something?"
01:54:53;01:54:54;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"That's exactly what it was."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Honestly, I'm glad that's all it was"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"'cause I can picture a universe where Crosby was like,"
01:55:00;01:55:03;"""Heard him, not a fan."""
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Where it could have been just like negative."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Just like, ""I caught him on TV once."""
01:55:07;01:55:08;"- ""Caught a wink."""
01:55:08;01:55:09;"- Yeah, pretty weak, man."
01:55:09;01:55:12;"And then I would have had to get in his face"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"because he talks a lot of (beep)"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"but Jake, you were backing me up on this."
01:55:16;01:55:20;"I like Crosby, he's a legend, but he talks too much (beep)"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"and I don't mean to do a low blow here,"
01:55:22;01:55:25;"but of Crosby, Stills, and Nash,"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"he is the least accomplished songwriter."
01:55:27;01:55:27;"So have like--"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"- By a mile, folks."
01:55:28;01:55:29;"- By a mile."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"And look, he's got a beautiful voice."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"He's an absolute legend."
01:55:33;01:55:36;"But when you're the least accomplished songwriter"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"in Crosby, Stills, and Nash,"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"you think you'd learn a little humility."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"- Yeah."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"- You don't need to be always talking (beep)"
01:55:42;01:55:43;"about Jim Morrison."
01:55:43;01:55:45;"Maybe he's coming from a place that we don't understand."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"- Hard agree."
01:55:46;01:55:49;"I mean, look, his first record,"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"I wish I could remember my name."
01:55:50;01:55:52;"Is that the name of it?"
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- Yeah, yeah, that sounds right."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"- Great record."
01:55:54;01:55:57;"It's real vibey and kind of droney."
01:55:57;01:56:00;"There's only like two real songs on it"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"and he makes it work, but yeah,"
01:56:02;01:56:03;"not a songwriter per se."
01:56:03;01:56:06;"- It would have been cool"
01:56:06;01:56:07;"if there's a David Crosby character"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"in ""Once Upon a Time in America."""
01:56:09;01:56:11;"- Hollywood?"
01:56:11;01:56:14;"- Timothee Chalamet plays a young David Crosby."
01:56:14;01:56:18;"I need to learn some more young actors' names"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"for maybe ""Flights of Fancies."""
01:56:20;01:56:23;"- I feel like you need someone a little stockier."
01:56:23;01:56:24;"Dude, Miles Tauber."
01:56:24;01:56:25;"- A Harry Potter."
01:56:25;01:56:28;"Daniel Radcliffe."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"- Just throw Hannah."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Wait, who'd you say, Jake?"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"- Miles Teller, dude."
01:56:34;01:56:35;"- Oh yeah, he could do it."
01:56:35;01:56:36;"Wait, you have one time?"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"- He's kind of like stocky, has that same nose."
01:56:38;01:56:41;"- What about Ansel Elgort, Baby Driver?"
01:56:41;01:56:43;"- Oh yeah, I think if you throw"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"the '60s Crosby mustache on him, it could work."
01:56:46;01:56:47;"- Sure."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"- Okay, the number two song,"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"""Future Life is Good"" featuring Drake."
01:56:50;01:56:54;"You know what, Colin, cut it, cut it."
01:56:54;01:56:57;"I don't wanna listen to the song again."
01:56:57;01:56:58;"I'm sick of this song and you know what?"
01:56:58;01:57:00;"Life isn't that good, fellas."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"- Wow."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"- This does not speak to the moment."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"All right, what's the number one song?"
01:57:06;01:57:13;"Oh, still Roddy Ricch, ""The Box."""
01:57:13;01:57:14;"It's unbelievable."
01:57:14;01:57:16;"This song has been number one on the charts"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"for like three months almost."
01:57:18;01:57:22;"This seems like a more appropriate."
01:57:27;01:57:29;"Everybody who's self-quarantined right now"
01:57:29;01:57:30;"is really in the box."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"They're not busting out the box."
01:57:32;01:57:51;"Wait, wait, hold on."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"I think, I never caught that line before."
01:57:53;01:57:56;"He's talking about somebody wiping a person's nose."
01:57:56;01:57:59;"♪ I'm gonna wipe 'em nose ♪"
01:57:59;01:58:00;"♪ They slash that ♪"
01:58:00;01:58:03;"♪ I won't never sell my soul ♪"
01:58:03;01:58:04;"♪ And I can back that ♪"
01:58:04;01:58:05;"- I didn't know that there's a reference"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"to nose wiping in this song."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"And when did the song come out?"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"- Oh man, what, last?"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"- Came out last December."
01:58:13;01:58:14;"And this is important."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"Sam, can I get a number of questions?"
01:58:15;01:58:17;"A lot of people have told me this"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"and I think it's worth knowing for sure."
01:58:19;01:58:23;"Is it true that runny nose is not a symptom"
01:58:23;01:58:26;"of the COVID-19?"
01:58:26;01:58:27;"- No."
01:58:30;01:58:31;"- Let's get a number crunch."
01:58:31;01:58:34;"- Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:58:34;01:58:37;"- So the symptoms are cough, fever,"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"and shortness of breath."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"- So not a runny nose."
01:58:40;01:58:43;"So if you're just, I've read all these accounts,"
01:58:43;01:58:44;"I'm sure everybody else is like this,"
01:58:44;01:58:48;"where people are describing all sorts of other symptoms."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"And then I tested positive."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"My only symptoms was a headache and diarrhea."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"And you're just like, Jesus."
01:58:53;01:58:54;"- Yeah."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"- Can we get on the same page about this?"
01:58:56;01:58:59;"But anyway, it seems, maybe this is true then."
01:58:59;01:59:02;"People keep saying it's not runny nose."
01:59:02;01:59:05;"So if we got any TC heads at home"
01:59:05;01:59:08;"with a runny nose freaking out,"
01:59:08;01:59:12;"take a deep breath, check, and then ask yourself,"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"do I have tightness of breath?"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"And if you don't, and you got a runny nose,"
01:59:15;01:59:18;"then just go back to the Billy Wilder Film Festival"
01:59:18;01:59:20;"and don't freak out."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"- Oh, but you know what, guys?"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"I don't want to be a super spreader"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"of misinformation here."
01:59:25;01:59:28;"I'm looking at a CDC document that says"
01:59:28;01:59:32;"that patients may also have a runny nose,"
01:59:32;01:59:38;"nasal congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, aches and pains."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"I mean, it's kind of like everything."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"- Okay, well--"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"- It's not helpful at all."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"- I think the most important thing is just like,"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"don't freak out if you have symptoms,"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"monitor their severity."
01:59:49;01:59:52;"'Cause like, there's still people out here getting the flu,"
01:59:52;01:59:53;"out here getting regular colds,"
01:59:53;01:59:56;"which are caused by other coronaviruses."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"People got allergies."
01:59:58;01:59:59;"You know, there's a lot happening at once."
01:59:59;02:00:04;"So, you know, monitor it and keep your eye on it."
02:00:04;02:00:08;"All right, well, guys, my feeling at the end of this episode"
02:00:08;02:00:12;"is not that different than a in-person TC."
02:00:12;02:00:15;"I feel like we hung out, we went deep."
02:00:15;02:00:16;"It's kind of a weird energy, but,"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"and look, we talked about coronavirus,"
02:00:18;02:00:20;"but I think we had enough flights of fancy"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"that we didn't dwell on it the whole time."
02:00:23;02:00:25;"So hopefully we got like the right mix of--"
02:00:25;02:00:28;"- Oh."
02:00:28;02:00:30;"- Oh no."
02:00:30;02:00:32;"- I think we just lost Ezra."
02:00:32;02:00:34;"I think his phone died maybe."
02:00:34;02:00:36;"Right as he was kind of reaching the crescendo"
02:00:36;02:00:38;"of his conclusion there."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"Anyway, great app, guys."
02:00:40;02:00:44;"- Yeah, it's just me and Jake left,"
02:00:44;02:00:45;"trying to call him back."
02:00:45;02:00:48;"- Yeah, this is the real skeleton crew here."
02:00:48;02:00:50;"Well, Seinfeld, great seeing you."
02:00:50;02:00:54;"I hope to see you for next show in person."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"- Yeah, man, I hope so too."
02:00:56;02:00:57;"This feels like a one-off."
02:00:57;02:00:59;"We shouldn't do this kind of show twice."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"- No, no, this feels like a real,"
02:01:01;02:01:05;"this really met the moment."
02:01:05;02:01:05;"- Yeah."
02:01:05;02:01:07;"- Yeah, I don't think Ezra's picking up."
02:01:07;02:01:12;"So anyway, TC fam, stay safe and rest up."
02:01:12;02:01:15;"See you guys in two weeks."
02:01:15;02:01:16;"- Time Crisis."
02:01:16;02:01:17;"With you."
02:01:17;02:01:19;"- Oh, (beep) my phone died."
02:01:19;02:01:19;"Sorry, guys."
02:01:20;02:01:21;"Jake?"
02:01:21;02:01:22;"Seinfeld?"
02:01:22;02:01:25;"All right, they had to bounce."
02:01:25;02:01:27;"I get it."
02:01:27;02:01:31;"Anyway, this was Quarantine Time Crisis."
02:01:31;02:01:34;"We hope all the TC heads are being safe,"
02:01:34;02:01:37;"doing what you gotta do to not get sick"
02:01:37;02:01:39;"and not help spread coronavirus."
02:01:39;02:01:44;"And if we got anybody who's a first line type person,"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"a responder, somebody who works in healthcare"
02:01:46;02:01:49;"or who has a job where you have to keep going out,"
02:01:49;02:01:50;"thank you for what you're doing"
02:01:50;02:01:51;"to help keep things running."
02:01:51;02:01:54;"And also, you'd be especially safe."
02:01:54;02:01:55;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
02:01:55;02:01:58;"We'll figure out a way to keep this thing going."
02:01:58;02:01:59;"Peace."
02:01:59;02:02:02;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"One."
