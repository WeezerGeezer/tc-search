00:00;00:05;"It's time crisis, 2018."
00:05;00:07;"We're about to burst into the new year."
00:07;00:13;"We'll be talking about the Taco Bell Belluminati commercial."
00:13;00:18;"We'll also be talking about Tim Hortons, a very popular Canadian chain."
00:18;00:24;"All this, plus a phone call from journalist and podcaster Jeff Weiss to let us know what's"
00:24;00:27;"been happening with LA Weekly."
00:27;00:29;"Welcome to 2018."
00:29;00:35;"Welcome to Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:35;00:37;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-beace."
00:37;00:38;"One."
00:38;00:51;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:51;01:00;"My picture clear, everything seems so easy."
01:00;01:16;"And so I tell to the world, one of us had to go."
01:16;01:17;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:17;01:18;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:18;01:19;"Time crisis 2018."
01:19;01:20;"Another year, so what?"
01:20;01:21;"Happy new year."
01:21;01:22;"Happy new year, Jake."
01:22;01:23;"Happy new year to the listeners."
01:23;01:27;"When do you stop saying happy new year to people?"
01:27;01:28;"Around now."
01:28;01:29;"Mid-January."
01:29;01:30;"Okay."
01:30;01:34;"I haven't seen you, I don't think, this year yet."
01:34;01:35;"Yeah, it's true."
01:35;01:39;"And it feels appropriate to say happy new year, but if I didn't see you until like the"
01:39;01:40;"last week of January."
01:40;01:41;"Forget it."
01:41;01:46;"Like, it was just like, hey man, it's January 27th, first time I'm running into you."
01:46;01:47;"Happy new year."
01:47;01:48;"Happy new year, bro."
01:48;01:49;"We'll be pushing it."
01:49;01:50;"So how was your new year, Jake?"
01:50;01:51;"Sounds like you came down with the something."
01:51;01:54;"Yeah, I came down with bronchitis."
01:54;01:56;"Still kind of fighting it off."
01:56;01:58;"I hear it in your voice."
01:58;01:59;"A lot of people getting sick."
01:59;02:03;"Yeah, it's been rough, but I'm on the mend."
02:03;02:05;"Played a big show New Year's Eve at Zebulon."
02:05;02:10;"Right, so Richard Pictures, your Grateful Dead cover band, played a New Year's show."
02:10;02:11;"I'm sorry I couldn't make it."
02:11;02:12;"How was it?"
02:12;02:13;"Where were you, man?"
02:13;02:15;"Well, we took a little vacation."
02:15;02:17;"We got back that morning."
02:17;02:18;"Nice."
02:18;02:20;"My significant other was invited to another party."
02:20;02:21;"Okay."
02:21;02:22;"I had to accompany her."
02:22;02:23;"I get it."
02:23;02:24;"It really tested my loyalties."
02:24;02:25;"This was more of a hip hop party."
02:25;02:27;"Two of my favorite things."
02:27;02:28;"Right."
02:28;02:32;"This was a West Side hip hop party, and you were doing an East Side Dead party, and I,"
02:32;02:33;"you know."
02:33;02:34;"I lost."
02:34;02:35;"I do feel bad."
02:35;02:37;"I did not make it out."
02:37;02:39;"It was a great show."
02:39;02:43;"So what's the crowd like at Grateful Dead cover band New Year's Silver Lake?"
02:43;02:44;"Pretty thick."
02:44;02:45;"Yeah."
02:45;02:46;"A lot of heads."
02:46;02:47;"A lot of dead heads."
02:47;02:48;"I don't know."
02:49;02:54;"Hannah talked to one person that is an elementary school teacher on the West Side of LA that"
02:54;02:58;"had nothing going on, heard about the show, took some shrooms."
02:58;02:59;"And rolled solo?"
02:59;03:00;"Rolled solo."
03:00;03:01;"Oh, hell yeah."
03:01;03:04;"It was just like blazed, like up front."
03:04;03:05;"Just like look."
03:05;03:09;"She had like this like sparkly lip gloss on, and then she was talking to Hannah after the"
03:09;03:11;"show, and she's like, ""Yeah, I mean I just."""
03:11;03:12;"How old?"
03:12;03:13;"27."
03:13;03:17;"27 year old female teacher?"
03:17;03:18;"Yes."
03:18;03:22;"Here's about Grateful Dead cover band playing across town on New Year's."
03:22;03:23;"No plans."
03:23;03:24;"Nope."
03:24;03:27;"Or is it that she hit up some of her like friends and was like, ""Guys, what's cooking"
03:27;03:28;"for New Year's?"""
03:28;03:31;"And they're like, ""Oh, we're getting like a nice bottle of wine and going over to Jeff's"
03:31;03:32;"house."""
03:32;03:35;"And she was like, ""Does anybody want to come see a Grateful Dead cover band on the other"
03:35;03:36;"side of town?"""
03:36;03:39;"And they were like, ""Oh, I don't think so."""
03:39;03:43;"And she was like, ""All right, I'll just pop some shrooms, jump in an Uber."""
03:43;03:44;"Rolling solo."
03:44;03:50;"Yeah, Hannah tried to rally some of her friends and they were all like, ""Yeah, I think we're"
03:50;03:54;"going to go to a party down the street."""
03:54;03:57;"I love, like it was like you just have called her your wife before."
03:57;03:59;"I mean, I know she is."
03:59;04:02;"It's just so funny that you guys are married now because the terminology changes."
04:02;04:03;"I know."
04:03;04:04;"Using the term wife."
04:04;04:07;"So I'm just, it's hilarious."
04:07;04:08;"My wife, but I was also funny."
04:08;04:11;"I felt self-conscious saying it in front of you."
04:11;04:12;"It's like funny."
04:12;04:15;"As time goes on, I'm sure you get used to it, but I'm also just picturing her being"
04:15;04:19;"like, ""Hey guys, so my husband's Grateful Dead cover band is playing on New Year's."
04:19;04:21;"It would really mean a lot if you came through."""
04:21;04:28;"I'm just like, ""Best wishes to your husband, but we're going to see the Chainsmokers DJ"
04:28;04:29;"in Vegas."""

05:57;06:01;"that you're actually attracting, like, serious fans."
06:01;06:02;"- I know. - Of the real band."
06:02;06:04;"So, like, when you guys are taking a break"
06:04;06:05;"in between sets or afterwards,"
06:05;06:08;"does anybody ever come up to you and be like,"
06:08;06:10;"""Shine a cat was too fast,"" or like--"
06:10;06:12;"- No, it's never, I never get critici--"
06:12;06:13;"- Because it's such good vibes in the community"
06:13;06:15;"for the most part? - Yeah."
06:15;06:17;"People are like, ""You guys have a real nice feel,"
06:17;06:19;"""like a real nice spirit in this band."
06:19;06:20;"""It's real lighthearted."""
06:20;06:21;"- Yeah. - That's what someone said,"
06:21;06:23;"and I was like, ""That's a nice compliment."""
06:23;06:25;"- Did you guys count down on stage?"
06:25;06:28;"- No, this was a little bit of a stumbling block, I feel,"
06:28;06:31;"because, so we played from 9.30 to 11."
06:31;06:34;"- Yeah. - And then we took a break,"
06:34;06:38;"and this DJ took over, and I thought the scene would be like,"
06:38;06:40;"oh, people, like, just watch us for an hour and a half,"
06:40;06:41;"they're ready for a breather."
06:41;06:43;"- Yeah. - The DJ's gonna play"
06:43;06:44;"some, like, fun dance music,"
06:44;06:46;"people will, like, get into that vibe,"
06:46;06:48;"and maybe we'll come back, or maybe not."
06:48;06:50;"- Yeah. - The DJ cleared the room."
06:50;06:52;"People were, like, ready to get out,"
06:52;06:54;"like, have a smoke, stand outside."
06:54;06:58;"So then the room was just empty for, like, 40 minutes,"
06:58;07:00;"between, like, 11 and 11.40."
07:00;07:01;"- Right. - And then we were, like,"
07:01;07:02;"talking to the owners, and we were like,"
07:02;07:04;"well, let's get back up there for, like, midnight,"
07:04;07:08;"and do, like, ""Scarlet,"" like, ""Scarfire,"" or something."
07:08;07:11;"- Like, three, two, one, happy new year!"
07:11;07:12;"- So we started playing around 11.40."
07:12;07:14;"We did the other one. - Yeah."
07:14;07:16;"- Like, a solid, like, eight-minute."
07:16;07:17;"(laughing)"
07:17;07:19;"The other one. - Yeah."
07:19;07:22;"- We did some other song, and then it was, like, 11.56."
07:22;07:23;"- Oh. - And we're like,"
07:23;07:25;"let's just start ""Scarlet."""
07:25;07:26;"- And bust through the new year."
07:26;07:27;"- Just who cares? - Yeah."
07:27;07:30;"- 'Cause we're not gonna, like, banter for four minutes."
07:30;07:31;"We could've, like, jammed, but it was sort of like,"
07:31;07:33;"let's just go, like, the energy was up."
07:33;07:36;"And then, like-- - Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum."
07:36;07:37;"- Bum, bum, bum, bum. - Bum, bum, bum, bum."
07:37;07:38;"- Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum. - Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum."
07:38;07:39;"- And it's 2018."
07:39;07:42;"- And then, like, four minutes into the song,"
07:42;07:45;"the crowd erupted, because everyone was on their phones,"
07:45;07:48;"saw that it was midnight, and was like, woo!"
07:48;07:49;"- But so that was kinda cool?"
07:49;07:51;"You were just jamming, and then, woo!"
07:51;07:52;"- Yeah."

08:48;08:49;"- Yeah."
08:49;08:52;"- It's time for Corporate Food History."
08:52;08:53;"(gunshot)"
08:53;08:55;"Let's talk about it."
08:55;08:57;"(mimics music)"
08:57;08:59;"- 2018's already off to a weird-ass start."
08:59;09:01;"I guess this actually happened last year."
09:01;09:06;"So Taco Bell unveiled a new commercial last month."
09:06;09:08;"It's called the Belluminati."
09:08;09:09;"- Okay."
09:09;09:10;"- I'm looking at the YouTube."
09:10;09:11;"This is what they wrote."
09:11;09:12;"""The rumors are true."
09:12;09:13;"""Signs have been there all along."
09:13;09:14;"""There's a powerful connection"
09:14;09:16;"""between the dollar and Taco Bell."""
09:16;09:18;"This is how the ad goes."
09:18;09:20;"- There's a powerful connection"
09:20;09:23;"between the dollar and Taco Bell."
09:23;09:27;"Because it unlocks a world of 20 decadent menu items"
09:27;09:31;"from breakfast to late night for just a dollar each."
09:31;09:33;"20 items for a dollar."
09:33;09:36;"20 steps on the pyramid."
09:36;09:38;"Who's really behind this?"
09:38;09:42;"Is it the Illuminati or the Belluminati?"
09:42;09:46;"Experience the power of the dollar at Taco Bell."
09:46;09:47;"(bell dings)"
09:47;09:48;"- That's hilarious."
09:48;09:51;"- So you're familiar with the conspiracy theory"
09:51;09:54;"that the Illuminati is an elite secretive group"
09:54;09:55;"that controls the world"
09:55;09:58;"and they hide their little signs in the dollar."
09:58;09:59;"And it's kind of like a meme."
09:59;10:02;"People kind of jokingly find a triangle in anything"
10:02;10:04;"as proof that the Illuminati controls the world."
10:04;10:07;"- I love corporations going all in on conspiracy theories."
10:07;10:12;"Like Carl's Jr. has a JFK assassination ad"
10:12;10:14;"coming out in March."
10:14;10:16;"I don't even know what the angle would be, but--"
10:16;10:18;"- Carl was there."
10:18;10:21;"- Carl was the second shooter."
10:21;10:26;"- Wendy's 9/11 was an inside job."
10:26;10:31;"- Papa John's birther conspiracy."
10:31;10:34;"- That one's not that far from the truth."
10:34;10:35;"- Wait, so what happened with this?"
10:35;10:39;"- Taco Bell basically made a joke about the Illuminati."
10:39;10:44;"And Charlie Daniels, famous country musician, older guy,"
10:44;10:46;"he had the song ""Devil Went Down to Georgia."""
10:46;10:48;"- Sure. - And he's a noted conservative."
10:48;10:51;"He got on Twitter and said, ""Hey, Taco Bell,"
10:51;10:54;"""the Illuminati is not a frivolous subject."""
10:54;10:57;"14,000 retweets, 40,000 likes."
10:57;10:59;"That's all he said. He kept it real simple."
10:59;11:02;"The Illuminati is not a frivolous subject."
11:02;11:03;"- Yes, it is. - Well, it's debatable."
11:03;11:06;"I mean, the funny thing is, the forces that control our world,"
11:06;11:09;"it's so obvious. They're in plain sight."
11:09;11:11;"There is also something funny about Charlie Daniels"
11:11;11:14;"being like, ""Hey, Taco Bell, giant corporation"
11:14;11:16;"""owned by an even bigger corporation,"
11:16;11:20;"""don't joke around about consolidated power."""
11:20;11:21;"[laughter]"
11:21;11:23;"It's like-- - Stay in your lane, T-Bell."
11:23;11:25;"- Yeah, it's like, we're all such morons."
11:25;11:28;"He literally could talk to Taco Bell and be like,"
11:28;11:31;"""Now, listen, guys, the fact that one company"
11:31;11:35;"""has outposts in every community in North America"
11:35;11:40;"""selling them 'Mexican food,' that's cool."
11:40;11:43;"""But the idea that there's forces in this world"
11:43;11:48;"""that infiltrate the way we live is no joke, man."""
11:48;11:51;"- Is he trying to say, like, the Illuminati's real"
11:51;11:55;"and you're getting into dangerous waters here?"
11:55;11:57;"- Oh, is that what he's saying? - Is that what he's saying?"
11:57;11:59;"- Yeah, I think he's basically-- I think he's saying,"
11:59;12:00;"""Taco Bell, you're joking about the Illuminati,"
12:00;12:03;"""but the Illuminati is real and dangerous and bad."""
12:03;12:05;"- They're watching you. It's like the ending of ""Network."""
12:05;12:07;"- It's like the way people talk to politicians."
12:07;12:10;"It's like--and he seems like he is a Trump supporter,"
12:10;12:12;"but it's like when Trump supporters"
12:12;12:15;"wanna kind of make excuses for him,"
12:15;12:18;"explain why he's doing such moronic stuff or something,"
12:18;12:21;"they often will talk about him"
12:21;12:26;"as if he's the victim of powerful conspiratorial forces."
12:26;12:28;"And it's kind of like you're literally defending"
12:28;12:30;"a billionaire."
12:30;12:32;"Like, that's a conspiracy in plain sight, man."
12:32;12:35;"A rich dude inherited money from his family,"
12:35;12:36;"became a billionaire through, like,"
12:36;12:38;"whack real estate practices,"
12:38;12:41;"and now he's president cutting taxes for corporations."
12:41;12:43;"It's right there. That's how the world works."
12:43;12:45;"That's how power in this world works."
12:45;12:47;"But instead, people wanna be like,"
12:47;12:49;"""Mr. Trump, watch out."""
12:49;12:51;"- We got your back, man. - ""We got your back."
12:51;12:53;"""We know that powerful forces are trying to hurt you."""
12:53;12:54;"It's--it's absurd."

13:45;13:47;"on, like, a conspiracy theory."
13:47;13:50;"It's kind of similar to how all the brands"
13:50;13:53;"have these, like, kind of funny Twitter accounts."
13:53;13:55;"- Right. Wait, who was that that had the--"
13:55;13:57;"was that Wendy's or Arby's or something?"
13:57;13:59;"- Wendy's and Arby's."
13:59;14:03;"Wendy's will quote-unquote ""roast"" a hater."
14:03;14:04;"- Really?"
14:04;14:05;"- Yeah, I forget who it is."
14:05;14:07;"I think it might be Jack Wagner,"
14:07;14:08;"aka Versace Tamagotchi."
14:08;14:10;"I've seen him every time, like,"
14:10;14:12;"these brands try to do some funny stuff."
14:12;14:14;"'Cause sometimes the brand Twitter accounts"
14:14;14:15;"will, like, get into a beef."
14:15;14:17;"And, like, so this guy, Jack Wagner,"
14:17;14:18;"will sometimes, like, tweet at both of them,"
14:18;14:20;"like, ""Oh, guys, it's, like, a hilarious bit."

14:26;14:28;"""and gave them health benefits?"""
14:28;14:29;"So it'll kind of, like, get in there."
14:29;14:31;"'Cause they--there is this kind of, like,"
14:31;14:34;"fake personality to the brand"
14:34;14:36;"that kind of puts it above criticism."
14:36;14:38;"Where there's, like, we're just self-aware,"
14:38;14:39;"just like you."

14:49;14:50;"I mean, that's just, like, the end of--"

14:52;14:55;"the end of irony if it's no longer--"
14:55;14:58;"if irony is no longer at all subversive or, like--"
14:58;14:59;"- That's a good point."
14:59;15:00;"- Used for, like, cutting?"
15:00;15:02;"- Yeah, it makes irony seem corny."
15:02;15:03;"- Right."
15:03;15:05;"- There was a big one recently"

19:36;19:38;"a rare occurrence on Time Crisis,"
19:38;19:41;"I believe you got some good stuff in the mailbag recently."
19:41;19:44;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
19:44;19:46;"Yeah, you know what though?"
19:46;19:48;"I'm struggling with this cold."
19:48;19:50;"Yeah? You want me to read it?"
19:50;19:51;"I think so."
19:51;19:56;"Okay. So this is an email Jake got from Sarah Podobnik."
19:56;19:58;"I'm guessing Podobnik."
19:58;20:00;"Sorry, I don't know."
20:00;20:02;"Eight minutes, Cape Cod."
20:02;20:05;"She said, ""Hey Jake and Time Crisis crew."
20:05;20:07;"Sorry to intrude on your inbox,"
20:07;20:09;"but I thought this recent story might fit well"
20:09;20:11;"with the TC corporate interest."
20:11;20:14;"This story is about Canada's most popular fast food chain,"
20:14;20:15;"Tim Hortons."""
20:15;20:17;"You're familiar with Tim Hortons, right?"
20:17;20:18;"I'm actually not."
20:18;20:20;"Are they in the US?"
20:20;20:23;"Ah, yes, there's a couple, but it's really Canadian."
20:23;20:25;"Have you been in Canada on tour?"
20:25;20:27;"Yeah. I think of it as having coffee donuts."
20:27;20:29;"You know what? We got a Canadian right here."
20:29;20:30;"Hey, what's up?"
20:30;20:31;"What's up Seinfeld 2000?"
20:31;20:32;"How's it going?"
20:32;20:35;"I want to remind people again that even though"
20:35;20:38;"your favorite TV show was set in New York,"
20:38;20:40;"a very American show, Seinfeld,"
20:40;20:45;"you in fact come from the great white north, Canada."
20:45;20:46;"That's correct. I do."
20:46;20:49;"We did have access to Seinfeld up there"
20:49;20:51;"along with other American television shows,"
20:51;20:54;"but yes, I am from the north that is white."
20:54;20:57;"So I'm sure you got a lot to say about this,"
20:57;21:00;"but I want to get to the email, but just quickly,"
21:00;21:01;"what is Tim Hortons?"
21:01;21:03;"Is it like Dunkin' Donuts?"
21:03;21:05;"I would say that's a good comparison"
21:05;21:07;"in terms of how widespread it is,"
21:07;21:09;"but it's a cut above Dunkin'."
21:09;21:13;"I would say it exists in the space of like,"
21:13;21:18;"in terms of level of quality between Dunkin' and Starbucks."
21:18;21:20;"But is it also kind of like a convenience store?"
21:20;21:22;"Could you buy a bag of Doritos there?"
21:22;21:23;"You can't get Doritos."
21:23;21:25;"You could get a bottle of Coke or Sprite,"
21:25;21:28;"but it's like, it's coffee, donuts, and sandwiches."
21:28;21:30;"Can you get like a breakfast sandwich?"
21:30;21:31;"Like an egg and cheese?"
21:31;21:33;"Oh, you could get a breakfast sandwich for sure."
21:33;21:35;"Full disclosure, like that was my first job ever"
21:35;21:37;"was at Tim Hortons."
21:37;21:38;"I love it."
21:38;21:40;"So you've been in the belly of the beast."
21:40;21:42;"I've been deep in the heart of darkness."
21:42;21:45;"Canadians tend to like love Tim Hortons"
21:45;21:47;"because it represents Canada."
21:47;21:48;"That's true."
21:48;21:50;"It's a very stereotypical Canadian thing."
21:50;21:53;"Tim Horton is a hockey player."
21:53;21:56;"So it doesn't get any more Canadian than that."
21:56;21:59;"So he was a famous hockey player who opened this?"
21:59;22:04;"Yes, he opened it, I think it was in 1967,"
22:04;22:05;"he opened it or '64."
22:05;22:06;"Nice dude."
22:06;22:07;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
22:07;22:08;"A little corporate history on the fly."
22:08;22:09;"A little corporate history, yeah."
22:09;22:11;"He died actually at age 44."
22:11;22:14;"But it blew up like after his death."
22:14;22:15;"Okay."
22:15;22:16;"Yeah, actually, funny story."
22:16;22:18;"Not that funny, but it was owned by Wendy's"
22:18;22:20;"at a certain point."
22:20;22:22;"In the '90s, Wendy's took it over."
22:22;22:24;"I mean, it is a knee slapper for a couple of years."
22:24;22:26;"[laughter]"
22:26;22:29;"You know, it was founded in '64."
22:29;22:31;"Wait, so did Canadians feel weird about that,"
22:31;22:34;"that their beloved Tim Hortons was briefly owned"
22:34;22:36;"by a non-Canadian company?"
22:36;22:38;"Yeah, that was an outrage."
22:38;22:40;"And believe it or not, actually,"
22:40;22:42;"Tim Hortons is now currently owned by Burger King."
22:42;22:43;"Wow."
22:43;22:45;"It's been owned by both Wendy's and Burger King."
22:45;22:47;"I have traveled across this country"
22:47;22:49;"from the east coast to the west"
22:49;22:52;"to the prairies to the Rockies"
22:52;22:54;"where the eagle makes its nest."
22:54;22:56;"It's a land of many cultures"
22:56;22:58;"who have settled far and wide"
22:58;23:00;"and have called themselves Canadians"
23:00;23:03;"and say the word with pride."
23:03;23:05;"So I come to the conclusion"
23:05;23:07;"that we share a common soul,"
23:07;23:09;"but it's not our vast geography"
23:09;23:11;"and not that famous goal."
23:11;23:13;"It's a simple cup of coffee"
23:13;23:15;"and a pastry with a hole."
23:15;23:17;"It's the power of Tim Hortons"
23:17;23:19;"and that's got to be the goal."
23:19;23:21;"Okay, so let's get back into this email."

26:03;26:06;"who probably already got a lot of money out of it."
26:06;26:08;"So she's like, you know, these people are already rich,"
26:08;26:09;"they've made so much money,"
26:09;26:12;"why do they have to be so sh*t?"
26:12;26:16;"- So the franchisees are the offspring of the CEO."
26:16;26:17;"- These particular franchisees, yeah."
26:17;26:18;"- Okay."
26:18;26:19;"- The story doesn't stop there."
26:19;26:23;"The Premier of Ontario, kind of like an American governor,"
26:23;26:24;"does that check out, Seinfeld?"
26:24;26:25;"- Yeah, that's accurate."
26:25;26:26;"- A Premier is like a governor?"
26:26;26:28;"- Yeah, that's exactly right, yeah."
26:28;26:31;"- So the Premier of Ontario got involved with this story"
26:31;26:33;"and she proceeded to call the store owners bullies"
26:33;26:35;"and to contact her directly with their grievances"
26:35;26:36;"about the wage hike."
26:36;26:38;"I've included a link to an article"
26:38;26:40;"explaining the situation more in depth,"
26:40;26:41;"but this situation asks the question,"
26:41;26:42;"in these corporate companies,"
26:42;26:45;"how much of a profit is necessary for the owners"
26:45;26:48;"before it starts to impede on the employee's quality of life?"
26:48;26:49;"Love the show, guys."
26:49;26:51;"Hope to get Seinfeld 2000's Canadian opinion"
26:51;26:52;"on this as well."
26:52;26:53;"Thanks, Sarah."
26:53;26:54;"Oh, we've been doing that, Sarah."

27:53;27:54;"but, you know, we talk so much about"
27:54;27:56;"what are the problems of capitalism,"
27:56;27:58;"some people, the first thing they think of"
27:58;28:00;"is consumerism, materialism."
28:00;28:02;"Those are also all probably negative things"
28:02;28:05;"for the interior lives of most people."
28:05;28:07;"But on the most basic level,"
28:07;28:11;"the simplest problem that we have as a society, I think,"
28:11;28:13;"when it comes to these big companies,"
28:13;28:18;"is can you really expect the owners of big companies"
28:18;28:20;"to improve the lives of their employees?"
28:20;28:22;"'Cause some people would say,"
28:22;28:23;"don't let the government intervene"
28:23;28:27;"and create all these rules to tell people how to do business."
28:27;28:31;"Can you expect that if these people own a Tim Hortons,"
28:31;28:33;"if a new law comes in that says"
28:33;28:34;"they gotta pay their employees more,"
28:34;28:35;"they'll say, all right, that's cool,"
28:35;28:37;"we'll make a little less money, but they'll make some more?"
28:37;28:39;"Or is there always gonna be some sneaky way"
28:39;28:42;"that people put their profits before their employees?"
28:42;28:44;"- Yeah. - Which seems to be the case."
28:44;28:46;"- I mean, the owners are probably looking at it"
28:46;28:49;"at kind of like a vast chessboard,"
28:49;28:50;"where from their perspective,"
28:50;28:54;"each store probably has a pretty slim profit margin."
28:54;28:56;"- Right. - And then if you own"
28:56;28:59;"400 Tim Hortons, then you're cleaning up."
28:59;29:01;"- Well, that's the thing. - And so,"
29:01;29:02;"and it's sort of like, uh-oh,"
29:02;29:05;"we already have a slim profit margin on each store,"
29:05;29:08;"and so we're gonna like shrink that,"
29:08;29:10;"and you know, that's what they're thinking."
29:10;29:11;"- I was reading about this,"
29:11;29:14;"and the average Tim Hortons franchise"
29:14;29:19;"would stand to lose $243,889"
29:19;29:21;"as a result of the minimum wage hike."
29:21;29:23;"- Annually? - Yes."
29:23;29:24;"- But what's their profits?"
29:24;29:26;"- That was not-- - I mean, look,"
29:26;29:29;"$240,000 is a lot of money."
29:29;29:31;"- Yeah, I mean, I wonder what a Tim Hortons,"
29:31;29:35;"like one store, what their profit margin is."
29:35;29:37;"- That was about my pay grade. - Let's Google that."
29:37;29:39;"- Well, that's the problem."
29:39;29:41;"A company like Tim Hortons,"
29:41;29:44;"you think they're this kind vibe Canadian company"
29:44;29:45;"founded by a hockey player,"
29:45;29:48;"you let them spread octopus-like,"
29:48;29:52;"their tentacles into every town in Canada,"
29:52;29:55;"that replaces the old school mom and pop donut place."
29:55;29:59;"And now you expect them to treat you"
29:59;30:01;"like they're a part of the community"
30:01;30:04;"versus just an investment opportunity"
30:04;30:06;"to try to suck money out?"
30:06;30:07;"Nah."
30:07;30:09;"- So between 2002 and 2008,"
30:09;30:11;"the average Tim Hortons franchise"
30:11;30:14;"earned, before interest and taxes,"
30:14;30:16;"$1.5 million a year."
30:16;30:19;"- Okay, so potentially we're talking about"
30:19;30:21;"you're making $1.5 million,"
30:21;30:24;"and you're gonna go down to $1.25."
30:24;30:25;"- Right."
30:25;30:27;"Then taxes and everything, so."
30:27;30:31;"Yeah, you're like cutting your profit margin"
30:31;30:34;"by like whatever it is, 18% or something."
30:34;30:36;"- So then they're paying some high Canadian taxes,"
30:36;30:38;"I don't know, what are they taking home?"
30:38;30:40;"Five or 600 a year per franchise?"
30:40;30:42;"Come on, that's plenty."
30:42;30:43;"See, that's the thing,"
30:43;30:44;"rich people always think they're broke."
30:44;30:46;"- Right. - You know, psychologically."
30:46;30:47;"- No, it's true."
30:47;30:49;"- 'Cause the owner, these people"
30:49;30:50;"who own these Tim Hortons,"
30:50;30:52;"they're not comparing themselves to their employees,"
30:52;30:55;"they're comparing themselves to their friend down the street"
30:55;30:58;"who owns 20 Tim Hortons and some Burger Kings."
30:58;31:01;"- Or they're looking at the total bottom line,"
31:01;31:04;"so if you own 20 Tim Hortons,"
31:04;31:06;"all of a sudden you're paying out"
31:06;31:10;"whatever, $8 million more a year."
31:10;31:11;"- Right. - In your cost,"
31:11;31:14;"you see that $8 million and you're just like, dude."
31:14;31:15;"- Yeah, or you're just looking at percentages."
31:15;31:19;"You're like, our profits are going down by 20%,"
31:19;31:20;"that's crazy."
31:20;31:22;"- Is it?"
31:22;31:26;"- What about the value of your people, your employees?"
31:26;31:29;"- Well, that's the problem, nobody agrees on that."
31:29;31:30;"That's a big problem."
31:30;31:32;"Do you think it's un-Canadian"
31:32;31:34;"what these people are doing, Seinfeld?"
31:34;31:38;"- Yeah, I mean, that's a big question,"
31:38;31:41;"but it does seem a little bit"
31:41;31:45;"against the kind of goodwill that Canada stands for"
31:45;31:47;"and the being that-- - Supposedly stands for."
31:47;31:48;"- Supposedly stands for."
31:48;31:50;"- Well, guess what, there's a boycott"
31:50;31:51;"called No Timmies Tuesday."
31:51;31:54;"- Yeah, just Tuesday. - Yeah."
31:54;31:56;"- And I think it was just one Tuesday."
31:56;31:57;"I think it was just the first Tuesday."
31:57;31:58;"- So people have Tim Hortons"
31:58;32:00;"as part of their day-to-day commute."
32:00;32:02;"They're stopping in. - Oh, yeah."
32:02;32:03;"- 100%. - They're getting that."
32:03;32:05;"- The boycott calls on Canadians"
32:05;32:08;"to support an independent coffee chain of their choosing"
32:08;32:10;"instead of Tim Hortons on Tuesdays."
32:10;32:12;"Although they say if you're participating"
32:12;32:13;"in No Nut November,"
32:13;32:16;"they don't expect you to also do No Timmies Tuesday."
32:16;32:19;"That just seems like too much. - You gotta pass."

35:38;35:39;"- All right, so we just took a little break,"
35:39;35:42;"and I don't think we're done with Tim Hortons,"
35:42;35:45;"because I don't think we've quite made it clear"
35:45;35:47;"to our non-Canadian listeners"
35:47;35:50;"the extent to which Tim Hortons"
35:50;35:53;"has insidiously wormed its way"
35:53;35:55;"into the life of every Canadian."
35:55;35:57;"- Saturated the landscape."
35:57;35:59;"- I mean, 'cause this is America."
35:59;36:01;"We basically invented..."
36:01;36:03;"- Chains. - Chains."
36:03;36:05;"Every American feels like,"
36:05;36:08;"""Oh, man, you can't walk a block without seeing a Starbucks."""
36:08;36:10;"- A Mickey D's. - A Mickey D's."
36:10;36:11;"Like, we--a Subway. We feel like..."
36:11;36:13;"- A Chase Bank. - We feel like America"
36:13;36:15;"is the most saturated country."
36:15;36:18;"But how many Tim Hortons are there in Canada?"
36:18;36:22;"- There are 3,802 Tim Hortons in Canada."
36:22;36:24;"- Okay, so you hear 3,802."
36:24;36:26;"That doesn't sound like that much."
36:26;36:29;"But Canada, although a large country,"
36:29;36:31;"is not a very populist country."
36:31;36:33;"- What is it, 30 million?"
36:33;36:35;"- 37 million. - Okay."
36:35;36:37;"Get out the old calculator here."
36:37;36:40;"37 million divided by how many?"
36:40;36:43;"- 3,802."
36:43;36:46;"- Okay, so that's one Tim Horton..."
36:46;36:47;"zz..."
36:47;36:50;"for every 9,700 Canadians."
36:50;36:52;"So let's just call it 10,000."
36:52;36:55;"One Tim Horton for every 10,000 Canadians."
36:55;36:57;"- Okay, so-- - Which doesn't--"
36:57;36:59;"it sounds, like, pretty sparse, actually."
36:59;37:00;"- Yeah, it doesn't sound that crazy."
37:00;37:02;"10,000 Canadians have to share one Tim Hortons?"
37:02;37:04;"- Right. - Doesn't sound like that much."
37:04;37:05;"- Right. It feels like more."
37:05;37:07;"- But let's look at America."
37:07;37:10;"Our population is 323 million."
37:10;37:12;"So what was the ratio, 9,200?"
37:12;37:14;"- 10,000."
37:14;37:16;"- So in America, if we wanted to have"
37:16;37:18;"one of something for every 10,000 people,"
37:18;37:23;"you would need to have 32,300 of that chain."
37:23;37:25;"- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
37:25;37:27;"- And, like, how many Starbucks are there in America?"
37:27;37:28;"- In the U.S."
37:28;37:32;"- In the U.S., there's 8,222 Starbucks."
37:32;37:33;"Just so people understand,"
37:33;37:35;"I know we're throwing a lot of numbers at you,"
37:35;37:38;"but America, we feel like there's a Starbucks"
37:38;37:39;"everywhere you turn."
37:39;37:42;"The ratio of Starbucks per Americans"
37:42;37:45;"is nowhere even close to the ratio"
37:45;37:48;"of Canadians to Tim Hortons."
37:48;37:50;"- It's 39,000 Americans per Starbucks."
37:50;37:52;"- Think about how saturated our country is"
37:52;37:53;"with Starbucks."
37:53;37:55;"Now imagine you're going to Canada,"
37:55;37:57;"and you're three times more saturated."
37:57;37:58;"- Four."
37:58;37:59;"- Four times more saturated."
37:59;38:00;"- Per capita."
38:00;38:02;"- Per capita by Tim Hortons."
38:02;38:03;"That's crazy."
38:03;38:06;"- So, yeah, just picture four times as many Starbucks."
38:06;38:07;"I can't even imagine that."
38:07;38:08;"- Even, yeah, four times."
38:08;38:10;"- How is that even economically feasible?"
38:10;38:12;"You'd think they'd be cannibalizing each other."
38:12;38:13;"- Bro, this is a great idea for a movie."
38:13;38:14;"- There's, like, a Starbucks across the street"
38:14;38:15;"from a Starbucks."
38:15;38:17;"- This is like a modern-day Rip Van Winkle."
38:17;38:21;"Jake goes to take a nap at Home Depot."
38:21;38:22;"- I like it."
38:22;38:23;"- Jake takes a nap."
38:23;38:24;"- Sleeping in my minivan."
38:24;38:27;"- Jake pulls into Home Depot."
38:27;38:29;"Do some shopping, but he decides"
38:29;38:31;"maybe he'll catch a few Z's first."
38:31;38:32;"He wakes up."
38:32;38:33;"He slept for 100 years."
38:33;38:36;"There are now four times as many Starbucks in America."
38:36;38:38;"Everything else more or less the same."
38:38;38:41;"The next two hours are Jake just forced to grapple"
38:41;38:44;"with what it means to live in a country"
38:44;38:47;"with four times as many Starbucks."
38:47;38:48;"Maybe then you, like, meet a Canadian friend"
38:48;38:51;"along the way who, like, tells you, like,"
38:51;38:52;"""I've been through this, man."""
38:52;38:57;"- Or they're like, ""Now there's twice as many Tim Hortons,"
38:57;39:01;"""so now it's 5,000 Canadians per Tim Horton."""
39:01;39:02;"- I mean, it's probably on its way."
39:02;39:04;"- Canada's just, like, you know,"
39:04;39:06;"staying way ahead of us with this."
39:06;39:08;"- Well, so Seinfeld, are there just, like,"
39:08;39:11;"very few mom-and-pop donut shops in Canada?"
39:11;39:14;"- You know, short answer, yes."
39:14;39:16;"I think that Tim Hortons is dominating"
39:16;39:20;"just based on pure anecdotal what I've seen"
39:20;39:21;"compared to, like, L.A."
39:21;39:24;"Yeah, I think they've given those mom-and-pops"
39:24;39:25;"a run for their money."
39:25;39:28;"- From, like, a capitalistic evolutionary standpoint,"
39:28;39:32;"Tim Hortons is maybe the most successful species"
39:32;39:34;"that could completely take over an ecosystem"
39:34;39:36;"and dominate it, 'cause, like,"
39:36;39:38;"McDonald's is very popular, but there's Burger King."
39:38;39:41;"There's plenty of independent burger places."
39:41;39:43;"Every town has, like, a weird, you know,"

42:24;42:25;"- $80--it's true."
42:25;42:27;"- 'Cause you're spending $3, $4 a day,"
42:27;42:29;"that's $120, $160."
42:29;42:32;"You're gonna spend another, uh..."
42:32;42:34;"$40 for coffee at home."
42:34;42:36;"- What are you doing-- - $80 to $100 a month in savings."

42:38;42:41;"I'm going to Subway, but I'm doing the $5 footlong."

42:54;42:56;"- Less than--I mean, more than five, maybe."

43:13;43:15;"- You going to Whole Foods? Where are you--"
43:15;43:17;"- If we're sourcing the same stuff"
43:17;43:19;"that Subway is sourcing"
43:19;43:21;"for the volume discount that they're getting--"
43:21;43:23;"'cause you have to think about it."
43:23;43:26;"They're probably buying turkey for, like, $3.99 a pound."
43:26;43:29;"You go to the Vons, you're gonna spend $11.99 a pound."
43:29;43:31;"It's gonna be better stuff, but you're paying"
43:31;43:33;"four times the amount, so I think it's--"
43:33;43:35;"- I've done the sandwich math, dude."
43:35;43:37;"- How much does it cost--"
43:37;43:39;"No, but I seriously want to know, how much does it cost"
43:39;43:41;"for, like, the average working man or working woman"
43:41;43:43;"to make their own footlong at home?"
43:43;43:45;"- Okay, so you go to Costco."
43:45;43:47;"I bet you could get turkey for, like,"
43:47;43:49;"$6.99, $5.99 a pound."
43:49;43:51;"- Why does it have to be turkey, though?"
43:51;43:53;"Can't it just be, like, peanut butter or something?"
43:53;43:55;"- We're recreating a Subway footlong."
43:55;43:57;"- We're comparing it to Subway."
43:57;43:59;"- Peanut butter's got nutrients. - I mean, cheese is a fortune."
43:59;44:01;"- That'd be hilarious if Subway"
44:01;44:03;"just started doing, like,"
44:03;44:05;"$2 peanut butter sandwich."
44:05;44:07;"- Oh, my God."
44:07;44:09;"[laughter]"
44:09;44:11;"That's very dystopian."
44:11;44:13;"It's like bread lines. Like, after the next"
44:13;44:15;"economic collapse, Subway's like,"
44:15;44:17;"""You know what? Times are hard."""
44:17;44:19;"Cup of tap water. - It's crazy."
44:19;44:21;"People really go hungry in America."
44:21;44:23;"Like, it's no joke. But then the question"
44:23;44:25;"is, like, how cheap"
44:25;44:27;"can you get things? - I mean, I'm always shocked"
44:27;44:29;"if I go to Vons, 'cause there's one near me."
44:29;44:31;"It's, like, expensive."
44:31;44:33;"- Well, and first, how much cheaper does it get"
44:33;44:35;"than Vons? - It doesn't--"
44:35;44:37;"- For a person who's really not making a lot of money, what are your options"
44:37;44:39;"beyond Vons? - Smart and final."
44:39;44:41;"Isn't that something? I've never"
44:41;44:43;"a grocery shop there. - Smart and final."
44:43;44:45;"Well, that's a classic thing, is that a lot of times"
44:45;44:47;"people who are broke pay a premium."
44:47;44:49;"- Right, right. - That's the famous quote. Was that James Baldwin"
44:49;44:51;"or something? It's really"
44:51;44:53;"expensive being poor, because"
44:53;44:55;"you can't afford to go"
44:55;44:57;"live somewhere where you have more access and"
44:57;44:59;"competition with goods, so you have"
44:59;45:01;"to kind of go to the local store."
45:01;45:03;"Like, God knows who owns it."
45:03;45:05;"If they care, you know, they can jack the prices"
45:05;45:07;"up. - Yeah."
45:07;45:09;"- There's a way that, like, poor people are even more"
45:09;45:11;"manipulated. They're already suffering 'cause they're poor."
45:11;45:13;"- Well, it's like, you go to an ATM."
45:13;45:15;"- Yeah. - There's a $3 charge."
45:15;45:17;"But you can only afford to take out"
45:17;45:19;"$20. So now you're paying"
45:19;45:21;"15% of"
45:21;45:23;"that 20 to take out the 20."
45:23;45:25;"So you're paying 23 to take out 20."
45:25;45:27;"If you take out 100, you're only paying 3%."
45:27;45:29;"- Right. - You know what I mean?"
45:29;45:31;"That's kind of, I think, what he meant, sort of. That kind of thing."
45:31;45:33;"- Yeah. - Where you're, like, paying out"
45:33;45:35;"the ass. - Or also, maybe"
45:35;45:37;"you go to your local furniture store."
45:37;45:39;"You definitely don't have"
45:39;45:41;"enough cash on hand to, like,"
45:41;45:43;"furnish your child's bedroom. - Right."
45:43;45:45;"- By just buying it outright. So they're like, ""Oh, don't worry."
45:45;45:47;"We've got, like, a layaway plan or something."""
45:47;45:49;"Over the course of"
45:49;45:51;"months and months of you paying these fees, you end up"
45:51;45:53;"paying twice as much for-- - Three times."
45:53;45:55;"- For a child's bed that if you had had"
45:55;45:57;"a little more cash on hand."
45:57;45:59;"So it's like when you're below a certain level"
45:59;46:01;"and stuff. Which all leads me back to"
46:01;46:03;"this question."
46:03;46:05;"How much cheaper can you make a footlong for"
46:05;46:07;"than $5? $5 already was--"
46:07;46:09;"Let's also keep in mind that $5 is not the"
46:09;46:11;"price of all Subway sandwiches."
46:11;46:13;"That's a special promotion. - That's the $5."
46:13;46:15;"Okay. - And I think it's $6 now."
46:15;46:17;"- I don't think it's possible. I just think we're dealing with a volume"
46:17;46:19;"issue. They're buying their ingredients"
46:19;46:21;"for so cheap because they're"
46:21;46:23;"buying in such huge"
46:23;46:25;"volume. I don't think you can do it. - But they're also"
46:25;46:27;"trying to turn a profit."
46:27;46:29;"- Yeah, but I mean, they might profit, like,"
46:29;46:31;"you know, 40 cents on those"
46:31;46:33;"sandwiches. - Okay, so you're suggesting that"
46:33;46:35;"the ingredients-- Forget about the"
46:35;46:37;"labor. The ingredients of a Subway"
46:37;46:39;"$5 footlong could be $4?"
46:39;46:41;"- I don't know how they"
46:41;46:43;"factor these things. I don't know if they're"
46:43;46:45;"factoring in their"
46:45;46:47;"rent and their labor costs"
46:47;46:49;"into how much they make on a sandwich."
46:49;46:51;"Or if it's strictly just the"
46:51;46:53;"ingredients of the sandwich. - It's a little hard. Any Time Crisis"
46:53;46:55;"listeners who prepare their"
46:55;46:57;"own lunches consistently,"
46:57;46:59;"and that might be a taste thing. It doesn't have to be a money thing."
46:59;47:01;"Some people also just don't want to go"
47:01;47:03;"out to eat all the time. How cheap"
47:03;47:05;"can you get your footlong costs down"
47:05;47:07;"to? I'd like to think over"
47:07;47:09;"the course of a month, you could get it down to, like,"
47:09;47:11;"$2. Am I trippin'?"
47:11;47:13;"- I think we have to do this as a Time Crisis experiment."
47:13;47:15;"We go to Costco. - Yeah. - We document"
47:15;47:17;"the whole thing on social media."
47:17;47:19;"- #TimeCrisisFootlongChallenge"
47:19;47:21;"- 140,000 retweets. - I love it."
47:21;47:23;"There's video of us"
47:23;47:25;"in Costco. We're buying"
47:25;47:27;"two hoagie rolls. We'll buy"
47:27;47:29;"a half a pound of turkey. - We gotta"
47:29;47:31;"do it on a week basis. - Okay."
47:31;47:33;"So five sandwiches. - Okay, family of four"
47:33;47:35;"for a week."
47:35;47:37;"[laughter]"
47:37;47:39;"That's 28 footlongs."
47:39;47:41;"[laughter]"
47:41;47:43;"- Okay, so you wanna make"
47:43;47:45;"28 footlongs."
47:45;47:47;"- There's also, I mean, obviously, the reason"
47:47;47:49;"I keep laughing is because"
47:49;47:51;"in our experiment, we presuppose"
47:51;47:53;"that everybody needs a footlong"
47:53;47:55;"for lunch. - You"
47:55;47:57;"need the footlong."
47:57;47:59;"- I'm sure if you-- - Eat half at lunch."
47:59;48:01;"Eat half at 3 o'clock. - All right, that's your"
48:01;48:03;"midday meal. It's your extended midday meal."
48:03;48:05;"Yeah, if we're just talking about sandwiches,"
48:05;48:07;"that's a different thing. - Right. Right."
48:07;48:09;"- It's hilarious to be, like, a family of"
48:09;48:11;"four eats four feet of"
48:11;48:13;"sandwich every day."
48:13;48:15;"[laughter] - So obviously,"
48:15;48:17;"our experiment is not truly"
48:17;48:19;"getting at the heart of the issue."
48:19;48:21;"I'm also just kinda curious."
48:21;48:23;"For a week, let's take it down to"
48:23;48:25;"a single person. Maybe that-- 'cause we're"
48:25;48:27;"really talking about a single person here. - Yeah."
48:27;48:29;"- The whole family thing is different."
48:29;48:31;"For a single guy or woman"
48:31;48:33;"who goes"
48:33;48:35;"to Subway almost every day,"
48:35;48:37;"how much money could"
48:37;48:39;"they save by making all their sandwiches on Sundays?"
48:39;48:41;"And for the"
48:41;48:43;"purposes of this experiment, we're assuming this person"
48:43;48:45;"wants a footlong every day."
48:45;48:47;"- #"
48:47;48:49;"#TimeCrisisFootlongChallenge"
48:49;48:51;"- That would actually be cool if, like,"
48:51;48:53;"if all our listeners-- I feel like we probably"
48:53;48:55;"have a lot of listeners, college students,"
48:55;48:57;"just, like, single people in their 20s."
48:57;48:59;"- Yeah. - Deadhead teachers"
48:59;49:01;"take shrooms. I'm just curious"
49:01;49:03;"for these people, how much"
49:03;49:05;"are you saving when you make a week"
49:05;49:07;"of footlongs? I just wanna know."
49:07;49:09;"What's the cheapest footlong you can make?"
49:09;49:11;"How far under $5 can"
49:11;49:13;"you get while still making a decent sandwich?"
49:13;49:15;"Sandwiches, man."
49:15;49:17;"Do kids still eat a lot"
49:17;49:19;"of sandwiches? I mean, that's just a classic. - Oh, I think so,"
49:19;49:21;"man. - 'Cause that's a classic."
49:21;49:23;"- I love sandwiches. - You do?"
49:23;49:25;"- I don't make 'em."
49:25;49:27;"But-- - Why don't you make them?"
49:27;49:29;"- Uh, we just-- I don't buy those ingredients"
49:29;49:31;"on the reg. I don't buy-- - Yeah, so you have no idea"
49:31;49:33;"how much it costs to make your own sandwich? - Well, I have an idea."
49:33;49:35;"I've-- historically,"
49:35;49:37;"in my life, I've made a lot of sandwiches."
49:37;49:39;"But in the last couple years,"
49:39;49:41;"it's kinda phased out. - I am, like,"
49:41;49:43;"legitimately curious about this."
50:37;50:57;"- So Jake, we're about to get a call from Jeff Weiss."
50:57;50:58;"- Cool."

51:11;51:13;"I'm sure Jeff will explain."
51:13;51:14;"- It kind of ties in"
51:14;51:15;"with some of the stuff we were talking about."
51:15;51:16;"I mean, they got bought."
51:16;51:18;"- By a bigger, so this is like a--"
51:18;51:21;"- A company called Seminole Media,"
51:21;51:25;"which was formed to buy LA Weekly."
51:25;51:29;"And they were sort of like not revealing their identity."
51:29;51:31;"And everyone was like, well, who bought LA Weekly?"
51:31;51:32;"- Right."
51:32;51:32;"- And then they revealed themselves"
51:32;51:35;"and it's like, Jeff will fill us in."
51:35;51:37;"But basically it's like some Orange County dudes"
51:37;51:39;"that are into like, you know,"
51:39;51:42;"right of center economic policy and that kind of stuff."
51:42;51:45;"- So this is like a beloved local alternative weekly paper"
51:45;51:47;"getting bought by--"
51:47;51:49;"- Some dudes that are like not copacetic"
51:49;51:49;"with that worldview."
51:49;51:52;"And then they came in and they fired all of the editors"
51:52;51:53;"or like whatever."
51:53;51:54;"- I wanted to keep Jeff"
51:54;51:57;"'cause he was one of the more popular columnists"
51:57;51:59;"and he was basically like, ""(beep) this."""
51:59;51:59;"I'm not--"
51:59;52:00;"- Oh, was he?"
52:00;52:01;"Okay."
52:01;52:02;"- Well, that's my understanding."
52:02;52:03;"Let's get him on the phone."
52:03;52:06;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
52:06;52:08;"(phone ringing)"
52:08;52:10;"- Hey, Jeff."
52:10;52:11;"- Hey, what's going on?"
52:11;52:13;"- Welcome to Time Crisis, Jon with Ezra and Jake."
52:13;52:14;"- Hey, Jeff."
52:14;52:17;"- So we know that all this stuff"
52:17;52:18;"with LA Weekly getting bought"
52:18;52:21;"and you leaving kicked off a while ago."
52:21;52:22;"Our show is every two weeks."
52:22;52:25;"So we're not exactly the most up to date"
52:25;52:27;"in terms of news and stuff."
52:27;52:28;"- Don't worry, it's still a dystopian future"
52:28;52:29;"that we inhabit."
52:29;52:30;"- Deeply."
52:30;52:31;"- So."
52:31;52:32;"- Yeah, that part's not going away."
52:32;52:33;"- Yeah, you know, totally."
52:33;52:36;"- So we were like, we're both vaguely familiar"
52:36;52:37;"with the situation,"
52:37;52:39;"but why don't you just walk us through it kind of quickly?"
52:39;52:43;"Give us just your take about essentially what happened."
52:43;52:43;"- Okay, well, basically,"
52:43;52:45;"the LA Weekly had been in the block for a while."
52:45;52:46;"Everyone kind of knew it was gonna be sold."
52:46;52:48;"Everyone sort of expected layoffs."
52:48;52:50;"Suddenly it gets bought by a mystery buyer."
52:50;52:52;"No one has any idea who this mystery buyer is."
52:52;52:53;"They don't show up to the office."
52:53;52:54;"They don't send an email."
52:54;52:55;"They're not like, they don't,"
52:55;52:57;"no telegram, no Morse code, nothing."
52:57;53:00;"One day they sneak into the office over Thanksgiving."
53:00;53:02;"And so people knew something was up."
53:02;53:03;"And then the next day they were like,"
53:03;53:04;"right afterwards, the editor,"
53:04;53:05;"or the publisher, excuse me,"
53:05;53:07;"gets an email saying that everyone"
53:07;53:08;"has basically been fired."
53:08;53:10;"Every single editor, the publisher,"
53:10;53:12;"half the advertising staff."
53:12;53:14;"No one still even knows who owned the paper."
53:14;53:16;"Finally, under pressure,"
53:16;53:18;"it was revealed who they were,"
53:18;53:19;"which was basically a consortium"
53:19;53:21;"created strictly for the purchase"
53:21;53:23;"of a bunch of Orange County Republicans"
53:23;53:25;"in nefarious think tanks."
53:25;53:27;"One of the men, the front man, if you will,"
53:27;53:29;"is a man named Brian Kaye,"
53:29;53:30;"who was formerly the vice president"
53:30;53:32;"of the Claremont Institute,"
53:32;53:33;"which New York Review Books"
53:33;53:35;"just had an article called Trump's Brains."
53:35;53:36;"And pretty much since then,"
53:36;53:38;"they've been just failing miserably"
53:38;53:40;"for the last two months."
53:40;53:41;"We've been boycotting them."
53:41;53:43;"We shut down one of their events."
53:43;53:45;"And ultimately the politics decide"
53:45;53:47;"it's just kind of a disgrace to journalism,"
53:47;53:47;"the city of LA."
53:47;53:49;"- Why do you think these guys bought it?"
53:49;53:52;"Because like, from an outsider point of view,"
53:52;53:56;"you hear about a bunch of like crazy right-wingers"
53:56;53:59;"buying a left-leaning local publication,"
53:59;54:03;"and you assume that this is a nefarious plot"
54:03;54:05;"to take over the culture."
54:05;54:07;"But on the same time,"
54:07;54:08;"it sounds like such an idiotic plot,"
54:08;54:13;"as if somebody, a local LA person who reads LA Weekly,"
54:13;54:14;"and then one day there's like,"
54:14;54:15;"what is it?"
54:15;54:16;"There's gonna be a headline that's like,"
54:16;54:17;"Trump's cool."
54:17;54:18;"- Condos are awesome."
54:19;54:20;"- Actually, Trump's sick."
54:20;54:21;"We were wrong."
54:21;54:21;"- Like, it sounds like such a,"
54:21;54:24;"it sounds so weird that they targeted LA Weekly,"
54:24;54:25;"or did they just think it was a good way"
54:25;54:26;"for them to make money?"
54:26;54:28;"- Yeah, I think it's threefold."
54:28;54:30;"The first is, yeah, I do think it was ideological."
54:30;54:32;"I think they wanted to, you know,"
54:32;54:33;"they'd have a little pro-Weed coverage."
54:33;54:35;"They'd be like, hey guys, we like to toke."
54:35;54:37;"And then they'd kind of also undermine it, you know,"
54:37;54:39;"with anti-teachers union stuff,"
54:39;54:41;"the huge democratic donors,"
54:41;54:42;"attacking far left candidates,"
54:42;54:44;"you know, supporting far left candidates"
54:44;54:45;"to kind of split the democratic vote."
54:45;54:47;"Maybe you take down a Maxine Waters"
54:47;54:48;"with a scandal piece."
54:48;54:49;"Kind of the different ways"
54:49;54:51;"that you can kind of bring someone down"
54:51;54:52;"kind of in an insidious way."
54:52;54:54;"I think, too, there was obviously the Weed element of it."
54:54;54:56;"One of the guys was a Weed lawyer."
54:56;54:59;"You know, libertarians have always been historically,"
54:59;55:00;"these guys are, they're such geniuses"
55:00;55:03;"that they're pro-Weed, but also pro-private prison,"
55:03;55:05;"which is a different story altogether."
55:05;55:07;"But yeah, they're just kind of, there was that."
55:07;55:10;"And I also think they also just were kind of"
55:10;55:12;"idiot FireFast bros that were like, let's be legends."
55:12;55:15;"And I think that's part of it."
55:15;55:18;"And yeah, it's great 'cause they will be,"
55:18;55:20;"every time anyone Googles their name"
55:20;55:21;"for the rest of their life,"
55:21;55:23;"they'll be reminded of the fact that they're basically"
55:23;55:25;"the journalism equivalent of the FireFast."
55:25;55:28;"♪ Where would I be without my baby ♪"
55:28;55:30;"♪ To throw the law on my break man ♪"
55:30;55:33;"♪ And I don't wanna go crazy ♪"

55:46;55:48;"- Can you explain to the listeners a little bit,"
55:48;55:50;"especially for the younger listeners"
55:50;55:54;"who probably didn't grow up picking up"
55:54;55:56;"the physical copy of an All Weekly,"
55:56;55:58;"and they maybe have a sense that they live"
55:58;56:00;"in a liberal area or that they encounter"
56:00;56:04;"a lot of citizen journalists on Medium or Twitter."
56:04;56:06;"Can you explain a little bit why they need to understand"
56:06;56:09;"that they shouldn't be lulled into complacency"
56:09;56:10;"and why it still is really important"
56:10;56:12;"that there's journalists getting paid"
56:12;56:15;"at local independent publications?"
56:15;56:16;"- Well, it's an interesting thing, right?"
56:16;56:18;"So like Donald Trump announced that"
56:18;56:21;"they're removing protections of Salvadorans, right?"
56:21;56:22;"So even if you're not Salvadoran,"
56:22;56:24;"like there's such a prominent place in LA,"
56:24;56:27;"like tens of thousands of Salvadorans in Los Angeles,"
56:27;56:29;"principally in this district called Pico Union."
56:29;56:33;"And like, it's important for that community to be covered"
56:33;56:34;"and to see how it's affecting your neighbors."
56:34;56:36;"It's important to kind of,"
56:36;56:39;"whether it's like local arts and culture,"
56:39;56:41;"like there's a big arts thing going on right now,"
56:41;56:43;"the biggest arts, like a symposium"
56:43;56:46;"or like a weekly festival thing going on in LA,"
56:46;56:48;"nobody's been covering it for LA Weekly."
56:48;56:49;"And so you wanna be an artist or creative type,"
56:49;56:52;"like you're not gonna get your album covered."
56:52;56:55;"You're not gonna get your gallery exhibition covered."
56:55;56:56;"And it's like, at a certain point,"
56:56;56:57;"you're gonna look around and it's like,"
56:57;56:58;"yes, citizen journalists are cool,"
56:58;57:01;"but these legacy publications have value."
57:01;57:03;"And that's why these people are buying them, they know."
57:03;57:05;"It's why the Koch brothers are buying Time."
57:05;57:07;"It's not because Time's gonna be that profitable."
57:07;57:09;"It's because Time is Time."
57:09;57:10;"LA Weekly is LA Weekly."
57:10;57:12;"The Village Voice is still gonna be the paper"
57:12;57:15;"that had Lester Banks and Robert Christown"
57:15;57:16;"dating back to Norman Mailer."
57:16;57:18;"It has these legacies, you know,"
57:18;57:20;"and they know that and they're preying upon that."
57:20;57:25;"And ultimately, like, people just need to get paid to like,"
57:25;57:26;"'cause it is, journalism is a public good."
57:26;57:28;"I think one of the most important things"
57:28;57:30;"that we've seen out of this kind of like fraud environment"
57:30;57:32;"is journalists in the media, like kind of conveying"
57:32;57:34;"to people that, yeah, like there's a lot of (beep)"
57:34;57:35;"there's a lot of clickbait, it does suck."
57:35;57:37;"There's a lot of terrible journalism."
57:37;57:40;"Conversely, like Alabama was,"
57:40;57:42;"literally now has a Democratic Senator"
57:42;57:44;"because the Washington Post were such good journalists,"
57:44;57:49;"you know, and you can't only rely on Jeff Bezos"
57:49;57:51;"to save the day or, you know, the New York Times."
57:51;57:53;"It's really important that, you know,"
57:53;57:54;"you have to get a start somewhere"
57:54;57:56;"and there's a lot of writers and, you know,"
57:56;57:58;"people like, you know, maybe you wanna be a page designer."
57:58;57:59;"You know, I spoke to a kid the other day"
57:59;58:01;"and he's like, you know, I'm a designer."
58:01;58:03;"I always wanted to do like an LA Weekly cover."
58:03;58:06;"And those things are kind of being shut down."
58:06;58:09;"- Right, and I think also a lot of us non-journalists"
58:09;58:13;"take for granted that we think that we're getting"
58:13;58:15;"information from a million sources,"
58:15;58:18;"but Buzzfeed and HuffPo and all these places,"
58:18;58:21;"they take and repackage stories"
58:21;58:24;"that you should pray to God came from"
58:24;58:25;"a real journalistic source."
58:25;58:27;"And I know it's so basic to say,"
58:27;58:30;"but it's like a place like LA Weekly"
58:30;58:32;"has editors and journalistic standards."
58:32;58:35;"And even when you're talking about taking down Roy Moore,"
58:35;58:37;"you can't half-ass that."
58:37;58:37;"- Totally."
58:37;58:39;"- If you like journalistic ethics,"
58:39;58:41;"you're gonna get murdered by the opposition."
58:41;58:43;"- And they tried, they did that Project Veritas thing, right?"
58:43;58:45;"And what's interesting is Project Veritas,"
58:45;58:47;"which tried to take down the Washington Post"
58:47;58:49;"by going to them with a fake accuser."
58:49;58:53;"The irony of that is Project Veritas is run by James O'Keefe."
58:53;58:56;"James O'Keefe is from the Claremont Institute,"
58:56;58:58;"which is the same organization that produced Brian Kayet,"
58:58;59:00;"who is now the LA Weekly guy."
59:00;59:02;"And it's also, I mean, I don't know,"
59:02;59:05;"I think about, when I was, I used to do LA Weekly cover."
59:05;59:07;"Like I did a bunch of LA Weekly covers."
59:07;59:09;"I always think back to one of the first ones I did,"
59:09;59:10;"which was, I don't know if you're familiar"
59:10;59:11;"with the Jerkin Movement."
59:11;59:14;"It was like a big thing in like 2008, 2009."
59:14;59:16;"I spent like a month shadowing these guys."
59:16;59:18;"We made like a little mini doc, you know,"
59:18;59:19;"in the early days of YouTube."
59:19;59:22;"And, you know, I wrote this like 5,000 word cover story."
59:22;59:26;"And it's weird 'cause that movement produced a YG"
59:26;59:29;"and I have the first interview with YG from that, you know,"
59:29;59:30;"and I produced DJ Mustard."
59:30;59:32;"So it's like even these stories that like, you know,"
59:32;59:33;"really start micro and you might think,"
59:33;59:35;"oh, it's a little fat."
59:35;59:36;"Like it's preserved kind of for eternity."
59:36;59:37;"That's our history."
59:37;59:39;"You know, it's always that trite thing,"
59:39;59:41;"like journalism is the first draft of history."
59:41;59:42;"But like, that's true."
59:42;59:44;"Like what happens when we don't have a history?"
59:44;59:47;"Then we are susceptible to these ideologues"
59:47;59:51;"and these craven men who are just basically"
59:51;59:53;"trying to exploit it and kind of tell us what the history is."
59:53;59:55;"- So for the listeners,"
59:55;59:58;"they should research the Boycott LA Weekly Movement,"
59:58;59:59;"keep that in mind."
59:59;01:00:00;"- Totally."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"- And what else can they do?"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Are there places that you,"
01:00:03;01:00:04;"and even just for local stuff,"
01:00:04;01:00:07;"what do you think they can do as an alternative?"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"- Well, I mean, it's a combination of things."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I would say it's, you know,"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"obviously I'm biased on my website, Passion in the West,"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"but there's a website called LA Taco that's really good."
01:00:15;01:00:19;"There's a Rosecrans Avenue is a really good local blog."
01:00:19;01:00:20;"I mean, to be honest with you,"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"like there aren't that many alternatives right now."
01:00:23;01:00:24;"And that's kind of what's terrifying."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"The city of, you know, almost 4 million people"
01:00:26;01:00:27;"and like it's only the LA Times"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"and the LA Times is the LA Times."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"You know, LA Mag is LA Mag."
01:00:31;01:00:32;"Like those are specific demographics,"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"like for stuff that's like,"
01:00:34;01:00:37;"I mean, it's like a cultural hub and that is gone."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"So I think like, I think everyone's gonna have to like,"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"you know, first of all, just to make Boycott LA Weekly,"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"if you see it, like throw it in the garbage"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"or pour water on it."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"But second of all,"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"like I think we're all gonna have to band together"
01:00:46;01:00:49;"and like support the people that are doing cool things"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"and also start doing cool things ourselves,"
01:00:51;01:00:52;"whether it is a zine,"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"whether it is a small blog that like people,"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"you know, it's like, I don't know."
01:00:55;01:00:58;"You probably remember when like Tumblr was kind of a thing"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"and like that was a cool little moment"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"because people were writing weird things."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"And I first started my blog in the early blog era"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"when you'd go to a website and you'd be like,"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"I don't know any of these rappers."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"I don't know any of these bands."
01:01:07;01:01:11;"I don't know this obscure rap record from like '93 Houston,"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"but it's incredible."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"We just need to do cool things"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"for the sake of doing cool things."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"And like, obviously we need to get paid too."
01:01:17;01:01:17;"So, I mean, I don't know."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"I think the future is a combination of that."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"I think journalists are gonna have to,"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"and writers and artists in general"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"are gonna have to sell themselves to their fans"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"in a way that we probably don't like to,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"but I guess that's just the reality of it."
01:01:28;01:01:32;"And I think like, but I do think it's not hopeless."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"I appreciate you guys shining a light on this"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"because it's important for everyone to kind of know."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"- No, we want people to know."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"I mean, on this show, we did like literally just before"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"we were talking about Tim Hortons, the brand in Canada,"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"which is very ubiquitous in Canada."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"- It's a good donut."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- It's a good donut."
01:01:46;01:01:49;"There've been, as some franchise owners"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"have been punishing their employees"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"because the minimum wage went up"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"and there's been like a whole hubbub about that."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"We're kind of talking about how even Tim Hortons"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"is like seemingly, you know, super Canadian thing."
01:02:00;01:02:02;"When you like follow the money at this point,"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"it's owned by a giant company"
01:02:04;01:02:08;"that's mostly owned by a Brazilian investment firm."
01:02:08;01:02:08;"- Totally."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- Not that there's anything wrong with Brazilians,"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"but just that these things that dominate our landscape,"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"and it's just like a local paper,"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"just like your local donut shop,"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"your local place you get a sandwich,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"you at the very least to be remotely responsible citizen"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"have to be cognizant of who owns it"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"and what their interests are."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"- Totally."
01:02:26;01:02:29;"- It's like amazing how quickly we start to feel hopeless"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"that we'll never really be able to put our finger"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"on where this comes from."
01:02:33;01:02:33;"- Yeah."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"- But you got to, if you want to be healthy."
01:02:35;01:02:35;"- Yeah."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"No, it was wild."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"'Cause I was thinking with all these community newspapers"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"that this guy came from"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"and they're all owned by this conglomeration"
01:02:41;01:02:42;"and you follow the trail at the end of it,"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"it's like a 75 year old hedge fund billionaire"
01:02:45;01:02:45;"that lives in New York City"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"that's just spending like $60 million a year"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"at Palm Beach real estate just because he can."
01:02:50;01:02:50;"You know what I mean?"
01:02:50;01:02:51;"You're like, that's horrible."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"You're literally destroying local news."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"You can buy another like Palm Beach mansion,"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"which is just heinous."
01:02:57;01:03:00;"And I hate pink like that unless Cameron's wearing it."
01:03:00;01:03:03;"(laughing)"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"- All right."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Well, thanks for calling Jeff"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"and everybody check out Passion of the Wise"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"and the Shots Fired podcast."

01:06:12;01:06:20;"- All right, Jake, you ready for the top five?"
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Yep."
01:06:24;01:06:31;"- This week, we're comparing the top five hits of 2018"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"to 1978."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Why?"
01:06:34;01:06:37;"- 'Cause LA Weekly was founded in 1978."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"- Damn, they almost made it to 40"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"without getting taken over by some crooks."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"- 39, dude."
01:06:43;01:06:44;"- 39."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"Well, shout out to the old LA Weekly,"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"not the new one that you gotta boycott."
01:06:49;01:06:53;"So in 1978, this was the number five song on the charts, man."
01:06:53;01:06:55;"A band called LTD."
01:06:55;01:06:55;"You familiar?"
01:06:55;01:06:56;"- No."
01:06:56;01:06:58;"- Me neither."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"The song's called ""Every Time I Turn Around,"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"Back in Love Again."""
01:07:01;01:07:04;"- I feel like we've done a lot of 1978 recently."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"A lot of this palette."

01:07:43;01:07:45;"♪ When I look, I'm in ♪"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"- A decent song."
01:07:47;01:07:50;"- Milwaukee, Wisconsin's hottest funk band."
01:07:50;01:07:51;"- No, they're from LA."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- Oh, really?"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"It feels like a real local band."
01:07:54;01:07:56;"- But you know, a lot of the best funk"
01:07:56;01:07:57;"came from the Midwest."

01:08:04;01:08:07;"Just a solid number five, LTD."
01:08:07;01:08:10;"The number five song in our era."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"I remember when we first heard this song."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"We didn't know, was this gonna be a big hit?"
01:08:14;01:08:18;"But for this singer, Camila Cabello."
01:08:18;01:08:18;"- Oh, wow, this is."
01:08:18;01:08:19;"- This is a career-making song."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"- And it's been like a month since we've done this show."
01:08:22;01:08:23;"- Because she went solo,"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"and the first few singles did okay."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"But this is her first like big, big, big hit."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"- Wow."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"- I hear this everywhere now."

01:08:51;01:08:55;"- I wonder how Obama like encountered this song"
01:08:55;01:08:55;"for the first time."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"Was it like a hot track on iTunes?"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"And he was like, ""I'll push play on that."""
01:09:00;01:09:02;"Or like was one of his daughters into it?"
01:09:02;01:09:05;"Or, 'cause he's not like walking into the grocery store"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"and being like, ""What's this?"""
01:09:07;01:09:11;"- Maybe he's just like, he's playing the top songs on--"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- That's so funny to think about."
01:09:13;01:09:17;"That's cool that he's like actively investigating"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"what the top songs are."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"Or if it was like some assistant of his was like,"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"""You should put this on your playlist."""
01:09:24;01:09:26;"- He's like, ""All right, now break it down."
01:09:26;01:09:29;"""Why should I put this on my playlist?"""
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- It's like almost Clinton there."

01:09:38;01:09:39;"- Wilson like intern playing it."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"- Wilsert's also featuring Young Thug,"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"so you get to hit kind of two fandoms."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Oh, Young."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"Camila Cabello."
01:09:47;01:09:49;"I can't, I don't know how I keep doing Gwen."
01:09:49;01:09:54;"Camila Cabello and Young Thug."
01:09:54;01:09:57;"Kill Two Birds With One Stone, put it on the list."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"- Do you wanna hear the song, sir?"
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- No, not really."
01:10:00;01:10:01;"I'll take your word for it."
01:10:01;01:10:06;"I mean, Obama helped open up our relationship with Cuba,"
01:10:06;01:10:09;"so maybe they're also like remind people."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- There you go."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"- Remind people that they can go to Havana now,"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"partially because of you."
01:10:14;01:10:15;"- I wonder if Obama put,"
01:10:15;01:10:19;"""That's an awfully hot coffee pot"" on his playlist."
01:10:19;01:10:23;"- I liked, now you know I like a lot of them."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"I can't remember."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"(laughing)"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"- I love it."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"Now, I liked a lot of music this year."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"A lot of studio recordings, everything from Camila."
01:10:34;01:10:37;"I love Camila Cabello, Young Thug, and everything in between."
01:10:37;01:10:40;"But I gotta say my favorite song of the year"
01:10:40;01:10:43;"was not a studio single."
01:10:43;01:10:47;"It was a freestyle in a parking lot broadcast on BET."
01:10:47;01:10:50;"Man, I've done such better Obamas before, I don't know why."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"- That's pretty good, man."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"- The name of the song, hell, it doesn't even have a name."
01:10:55;01:10:57;"It's Eminem's freestyle."
01:10:57;01:11:00;"I call it, ""Awfully Hot Coffee Pot."""
01:11:00;01:11:02;"(laughing)"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"In it, the..."
01:11:03;01:11:08;"In it, in the song, Marshall matters debates"
01:11:08;01:11:13;"whether or not he should take the awfully hot coffee pot"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"and throw it on current president Donald Trump."
01:11:16;01:11:19;"Just as long as you're not throwing it on me."
01:11:19;01:11:24;"Anyway, the number four song in 1978 was Rod Stewart."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"- Ooh."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"- We don't talk about Rod Stewart a lot."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"- Let me guess."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"- '78 Stewart single."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"- Do you think I'm sexy?"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"- That's what I would've guessed, but it's not."
01:11:33;01:11:36;"- Is it a ballad?"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"I love Rod Stewart, early '70s Rod Stewart."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"- I actually don't know this song that well."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"- In fact, when I make the Tasteful Palate playlist,"
01:11:40;01:11:44;"there's gonna be some prominent early '70s stew on there."
01:11:44;01:11:47;"- You know this one?"

01:14:29;01:14:30;"- Yeah."
01:14:30;01:14:32;"- They're your lover and your best friend."
01:14:32;01:14:33;"- Right."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"- You're looking at them in the morning light"

01:14:37;01:14:38;"- Yeah."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"- And a melody suddenly strikes you"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"and you jot down a few lyrics quickly."
01:14:44;01:14:44;"- Yeah."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"- You get the initial impression down,"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"then you craft the song."
01:14:47;01:14:51;"That person has no ownership on that song."

01:14:54;01:14:55;"- Okay, but that's--"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"- Common sense."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"- That's just a social norm, man."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"- You're off your rocker here, dude."

01:15:09;01:15:10;"I was inspired by that."
01:15:10;01:15:14;"- What about an ex-girlfriend from the Contra era"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"was just like, you know what?"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I know that you wrote whatever song."
01:15:18;01:15:19;"- Horchata."
01:15:19;01:15:20;"- Yeah."
01:15:20;01:15:21;"- About me."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"- I know that you wrote ""Giving Up the Gun"" about me"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"and I have proof in this email that you wrote me in 2008"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"that says, oh, I've been writing this song"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"and it had you in mind."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"And now we've had 10 years to collect royalties on it"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"and I want half."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"- Remember when I told you that I was selling"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"my Colt 45, I have an email where I told you,"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"yeah, I don't know."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"Now I agree with you, but I'm just saying,"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"I've heard the opposite direction."
01:15:46;01:15:50;"I'm saying like, who cares if you inspired anything?"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Like, I think it's so whack when people sue for songs"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"just 'cause they're kind of similar."
01:15:54;01:15:57;"- Well, that's also whack, but that makes more sense."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"And also I think ""Blurred Lines"" was an egregious ripoff"
01:15:59;01:16:00;"of that Martin Gayle."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"- It's not egregious."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"- Oh my God, are you kidding?"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"It's like note for note, he should have been sued for that."
01:16:04;01:16:05;"- It's not note for note."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"- Absolutely."
01:16:06;01:16:07;"- It's just the same vibe."
01:16:07;01:16:10;"- The number four song in 2017, oops, 2018,"
01:16:10;01:16:15;"Bebe Rexha, do you know who Bebe Rexha is?"
01:16:15;01:16:15;"- Nope."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"- I love her."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"- Do you really?"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"- Seinfeld loves her."
01:16:18;01:16:19;"- She's so hot."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"- Whoa, Seinfeld."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"- Sexual edge."
01:16:22;01:16:22;"- What is going on?"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"(laughing)"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"- Get on the mic, man."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"If you're gonna talk about Bebe Rexha."
01:16:27;01:16:27;"- What is going on in the show?"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"- I don't have a lot to say, she's just hot."
01:16:29;01:16:33;"- Oh my God, this is suddenly Opie and Anthony?"
01:16:33;01:16:34;"- No."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"- What is going on in this show?"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"- It's not deeper than that."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"She's got that video with Louis Tomlinson"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"from One Direction, she looks great in that video."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"- Seinfeld."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"- I'm liking the sexual edge from Seinfeld."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"- I don't like what's happening in the show."
01:16:46;01:16:49;"We got Jake saying BS every other word,"
01:16:49;01:16:52;"now Seinfeld is talking about what girls are hot?"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"That's not what time crisis is about."
01:16:54;01:16:57;"About $5 foot long, tasteful palette."
01:16:57;01:17:01;"Okay, so you're saying Bebe Rexha's a good looking person?"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"- She's a handsome lady, but she's also got the song craft"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"to back it up."
01:17:04;01:17:05;"- Oh, yeah?"
01:17:05;01:17:05;"- Let's listen to it."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"- Have you heard it Ezra?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"- No, I've heard of Bebe Rexha."

01:17:13;01:17:13;"Let's check it out."
01:17:13;01:17:18;"This song's featuring Florida Georgia line."

01:19:03;01:19:04;"I wonder if you--"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"- Could have foreseen."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"- Yeah, if you said to those guys,"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"like, what you're doing right now,"
01:19:08;01:19:11;"one day there'll be a pop star from Brooklyn"
01:19:11;01:19:14;"teaming up with some bro country artists"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"to sing a song that sounds like this."
01:19:15;01:19:18;"They'd just be like, wow."
01:19:18;01:19:19;"I guess they would be like, all right."
01:19:19;01:19:20;"That sounds about right."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"- Our influence was massive."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"- That sounds like a typical cultural cycle."
01:19:24;01:19:29;"All right, I mean, I like the hook."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"This is kind of like this year's Body Like a Backroad."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"- Yeah."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"- Pop country."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"- I mean, just the song itself isn't terrible,"
01:19:36;01:19:39;"but those guys, like their vocals are just,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"I mean, you can't take it, it's just like a joke."
01:19:41;01:19:44;"- Well, that's just like your opinion, man."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- Yep."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"- I mean, you know, it's funny."
01:19:46;01:19:47;"- It's like hilarious."
01:19:47;01:19:50;"- First of all, every genre uses"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"pitch correction software one way or another."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"- Yeah."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"- There's almost not a record that comes out these days"
01:19:55;01:19:57;"from any genre that doesn't have some element"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"of using the auto-tune or Melodyne or something like that."
01:20:00;01:20:03;"But it's interesting in country, it's like,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"or at least with these guys, it's like they like to kind of,"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"- Yeah."
01:20:06;01:20:08;"- Like, honestly, it would take like another 20 minutes"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"for the engineer to make the vocal sound in tune,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"but a little less tuney."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"- Right."
01:20:14;01:20:14;"- But clearly they don't care."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"- No, they're going full mechanical."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"- It's part of the sound."
01:20:17;01:20:21;"So whether or not you like it, don't take away their agency."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"- Get on board, grandpa."
01:20:22;01:20:28;"- Back to 1978, the number three song"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"was also a country artist."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"So we just heard some 2018 country."
01:20:31;01:20:35;"This is what country sounded like in 1978 from Dolly Parton."
01:20:35;01:20:41;"- It's a good song."
01:20:41;01:20:49;"- Not particularly country either."
01:20:49;01:20:50;"- No, more pop."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"- Yeah."
01:20:51;01:20:59;"- Yeah, I don't think she wrote this one."
01:20:59;01:21:00;"- No."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"- She's a great songwriter, but she didn't write this one."
01:21:03;01:21:07;"- Who else did this song?"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"- This is the less tasteful side of the 70s."
01:21:31;01:21:33;"- It's pretty rough with those strings."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"- Yeah."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"But Dolly Parton, one of the all-time greats."
01:21:37;01:21:38;"- Yeah, for sure."
01:21:38;01:21:41;"- Amazing voice, great songwriter."
01:21:41;01:21:46;"The number three song in 2018,"
01:21:46;01:21:49;"Jake, let's see how quickly you can tell me what it is."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"- Okay."
01:21:50;01:21:54;"Oh, nice."
01:21:54;01:21:55;"Sheeran."
01:21:55;01:21:56;"- What's the name of the song?"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"- Perfect."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"- Nice."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"Is this with the remix with the--"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"- No, so much has changed since the last time"
01:22:02;01:22:03;"we talked about this."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"- I'm not up on the new stuff."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"- Well, I guess we listened to the Beyonce one."
01:22:06;01:22:07;"- Yeah, we did."
01:22:07;01:22:08;"- But then he also subsequently did"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"an Andrea Bocelli version."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"- Oh, that's right, that's right."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"I heard about this."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"I was in a text chain about this."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"- I gotta say--"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"- Didn't interrogate it."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"- Ed Sheeran."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"- Say what you will."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"- Say what you will."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"- Guy's just a workhorse."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"- He's kind of the most successful"
01:22:25;01:22:27;"male pop star of his generation."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Certainly one of the songwriters."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"- That's a crazy statement."
01:22:30;01:22:30;"I don't even know."
01:22:30;01:22:32;"What is his generation?"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"- I don't know, 20-something?"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"- He's like 28 or something?"
01:22:36;01:22:37;"- He might even be younger."
01:22:37;01:22:39;"- Like Bieber's the most successful"
01:22:39;01:22:41;"pop star of his generation, not Sheeran."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"- Yes."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"- They're the same generation, right?"
01:22:44;01:22:44;"- Yeah, you're right."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"He's the most successful singer-songwriter."
01:22:46;01:22:47;"- Okay."
01:22:47;01:22:48;"- 'Cause he writes more than Bieber does."
01:22:48;01:22:51;"But also, remember we heard Perfect"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"and we were like, not your best work, Ed."
01:22:53;01:22:54;"- Right."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"- I mean, think about the hours we spent"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"on the show dissecting Shape of You."
01:22:58;01:22:59;"A fascinating dissection."
01:22:59;01:23:00;"- Literal hours."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"- Yeah, literal hours."
01:23:02;01:23:04;"But Shape of You is such an interesting song"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"because he's painting this interesting picture"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"of him at the Chinese restaurant,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"mansplaining the sweet and sour sauce"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"to his bored date."
01:23:11;01:23:13;"I mean, it was interesting."
01:23:13;01:23:13;"- Yeah."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"- He was really laying his soul bare on that song."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"And then we heard Perfect and we're just like,"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"it's not a bad song, but it's like,"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"it's full of cliches."
01:23:21;01:23:22;"- Little stock."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"- And honestly, I think when we first heard it,"
01:23:24;01:23:25;"we were both kind of like, it's not gonna be up"
01:23:25;01:23:29;"as big a hit as some of these other Ed Sheeran songs."
01:23:29;01:23:32;"And yet this guy, he's not just a strong songwriter"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"and singer, he's kind of a marketing genius."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"You know, you need to be all three in today's--"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"- An entrepreneur."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"- He's an entrepreneur."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"- He's a renaissance man."
01:23:41;01:23:43;"- He's a renaissance man, which is what you have to be"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"in 2018."

01:44:21;01:44:22;"and pretend to care about the product."
01:44:22;01:44:25;"So, I guess a couple weeks ago,"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Cardi B posted that meme on Instagram."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"- I'm looking at it now."
01:44:29;01:44:30;"That's hilarious."
01:44:30;01:44:33;"- So I was getting a lot of texts and notifications."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"- I bet your phone was going off."
01:44:34;01:44:35;"- People were excited."
01:44:35;01:44:38;"- This is me at Whole Foods trying out cheese"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"and in the teriyaki spot."
01:44:40;01:44:41;"- So a lot of people asked,"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"""Do you think Cardi B knew that it was you?"""
01:44:43;01:44:45;"And I said, ""Clearly not."""
01:44:45;01:44:49;"Which is cool."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"She responded to the meme."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"But it's also funny with memes,"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"'cause it's not like, I didn't make the meme."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"It's just like such a--"
01:44:56;01:44:57;"- Just happened."
01:44:57;01:44:57;"- Yeah, and then right after that,"
01:44:57;01:44:59;"it was on the WorldStar Instagram account,"
01:44:59;01:45:00;"so it was really getting out there."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"And then actually recently,"
01:45:01;01:45:04;"somebody sent me the Mexican version."
01:45:04;01:45:05;"So that meme is out there."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"I don't know what to do with it."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"- You gotta capitalize on it."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"- I don't know how even, where to begin."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Anyway."
01:45:14;01:45:16;"- Oh, so yeah, the Cardi B--"
01:45:16;01:45:19;"- So it's kind of like their early '90s throwback."
01:45:19;01:45:20;"- Yeah."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"- And they made the videos like in In Living Color reference."
01:45:22;01:45:23;"- Right, right."
01:45:23;01:45:25;"♪ I'm on dollar bills and I be poppin' rubber bands ♪"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"♪ Bruno Sainz, tell me why I do my money dance ♪"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"♪ Like hey, flexin' on the 'gram ♪"
01:45:29;01:45:33;"♪ Like hey, hit that Lil Jon, okay ♪"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"- Heard this in the car the other day."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"Was disappointed that she wasn't on it more."
01:45:38;01:45:39;"- She's kind of the best part."
01:45:39;01:45:40;"She opens the song and then she kind of--"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"- Flexin' on the 'gram."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"- Disappears."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"- Hit the Lil Jon, okay."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"Cardi B is great."
01:45:45;01:45:49;"She's really become, in a very short period of time,"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"America's sweetheart."
01:45:51;01:45:53;"- Yeah."
01:45:53;01:45:56;"- She's, well, I guess, it's not that short a period of time."
01:45:56;01:45:59;"Like some people, she was on a reality show."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Some people have been following her for years."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"But in terms of when her music career began,"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"the trajectory is like insane."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Remember when we were first talking about ""Bodak Yellow"""
01:46:08;01:46:11;"and it was kind of vying with Taylor Swift for number one?"
01:46:11;01:46:15;"Since then, she truly is a national treasure."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"Everybody likes her."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"She's really just so likable."
01:46:18;01:46:19;"- Sure."
01:46:19;01:46:22;"- I can't remember a time when an artist,"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"through essentially one song,"
01:46:24;01:46:28;"plus the sheer force of their own personality,"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"became like an icon that quickly."
01:46:30;01:46:33;"- I wonder what it was like when Madonna came out"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"in like '82 or whatever that was."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"- It might have been a similar thing."
01:46:37;01:46:40;"I was watching her on the Jimmy Fallon show."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"- What a year, what a year."
01:46:41;01:46:43;"- You know what, Hannah actually showed this to me."
01:46:43;01:46:44;"- Oh really?"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"- I watched this."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"- Congrats on everything and thanks for being here."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"- Thank you."
01:46:47;01:46:50;"- It's a great interview."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"Like she comes in, she's like so confident,"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"making weird little noises."
01:46:53;01:46:54;"- Yeah."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"- That's like some real America's sweetheart (beep)."
01:46:57;01:46:59;"You sit on the couch with like Jimmy Fallon"
01:46:59;01:47:02;"and you outshine him in the first two seconds."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"He's a likable guy."
01:47:03;01:47:04;"- Yep."
01:47:04;01:47:05;"- I mean, people have their issues,"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"but he's like, he's a very likable guy."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"- Sure."
01:47:08;01:47:09;"- And he's like, oh yeah, Cardi B."
01:47:09;01:47:10;"And then in the first, she immediately,"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"'cause you know, a lot of people are nervous"
01:47:12;01:47:13;"the first time they're on the show."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"She comes in."
01:47:14;01:47:16;"- Congrats on everything and thanks for being here."
01:47:16;01:47:16;"- Thank you."
01:47:16;01:47:20;"- She already won, she already won the audience over."
01:47:20;01:47:21;"- Yep."
01:47:21;01:47:24;"- This is interesting too."
01:47:24;01:47:26;"The listeners who haven't seen this might appreciate it"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"'cause she explains where her name comes from."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"- Oh yeah."
01:47:29;01:47:30;"- Where did that name come from?"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"- My name come from, you know what,"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"my sister name is Hennessy."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:47:36;01:47:37;"My sister name is Hennessy, right?"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"So everybody used to call me Bacardi."
01:47:39;01:47:41;"So I always call myself Bacardi, right?"
01:47:41;01:47:43;"And then it was my Instagram name,"
01:47:43;01:47:45;"like Bacardi, Bacardi B."
01:47:45;01:47:48;"But for some reason, my Instagram keep getting deleted."
01:47:48;01:47:53;"And I think it was Bacardi that had something to do with it."
01:47:53;01:47:56;"So I just shortened it to Cardi B."
01:47:56;01:47:58;"- So Cardi B is the jam and I love that."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Move that over."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"- And I love that."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"(all laughing)"
01:48:05;01:48:08;"- I can imagine Cardi B, Jimmy Fallon interviews become,"
01:48:08;01:48:09;"you know, like when Letterman used to have"
01:48:09;01:48:11;"like the same people on over and you'd always be like,"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"wanna watch those two together."
01:48:13;01:48:14;"They have a good rapport."
01:48:14;01:48:16;"- You're Matt Damon, Jimmy Kimmel."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"Cardi B."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"- All right, great."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"- One of the quickest superstars we've ever seen."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"Maybe for her, it doesn't feel that quick"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"'cause obviously she's been working for years,"
01:48:28;01:48:32;"but from first single to just like ubiquity."
01:48:32;01:48:33;"- Hmm."
01:48:33;01:48:34;"- Everybody."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"- I don't know how that happens, but okay."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"I'm hearing you."
01:48:37;01:48:40;"- I mean, just think about other like big pop stars"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"like Justin Timberlake."
01:48:41;01:48:43;"He was in a boy band, you're vaguely aware."
01:48:43;01:48:46;"- Sure, what about Bieber?"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Didn't Bieber kind of just skyrocket out of nowhere,"
01:48:48;01:48:49;"like off of YouTube?"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"Not in the same way?"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"- Kind of, yeah, there's something,"
01:48:52;01:48:56;"they're both kind of like internet era, a sense."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"But even Bieber, it's like,"
01:48:58;01:49:02;"he had this like really intense like tween fandom."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"- Right."
01:49:03;01:49:05;"- It almost took like a year or two for him to become"
01:49:05;01:49:08;"like every adult in America knows who this guy is."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"- Do your parents know who Cardi B is?"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"- That's a good question, should ask them."
01:49:12;01:49:13;"- Mine don't."
01:49:13;01:49:15;"- Do my parents know who Cardi B is, I wonder."
01:49:15;01:49:17;"- My call is no."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"- That my parents don't know who Cardi B is?"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"- Maybe one of them."
01:49:21;01:49:22;"- It's possible."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"I mean, my dad's from the Bronx."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"Maybe he has some Bronx pride."
01:49:27;01:49:28;"It's also the cool about Cardi is that"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"she's one of the most like New York people"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"to be on the national scene in a minute."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- Her and Bernie Sanders."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"- Yeah, she's the most New York person"
01:49:37;01:49:40;"to become incredibly famous on a national level since Bernie."
01:49:40;01:49:41;"- Cardi."
01:49:41;01:49:45;"- Cardi B, we are both New Yorkers."
01:49:45;01:49:45;"- Ow."
01:49:45;01:49:51;"- I'm joined here by Cardi B."
01:49:51;01:49:55;"I am pleased to announce a Bernie Sanders, Cardi B."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"- Partnership."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"- Partnership."
01:49:57;01:49:58;"- With Ben and Jerry's."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"- Yeah, like a Ben and Jerry's flavor."
01:50:02;01:50:03;"Like a Cardi B."
01:50:03;01:50:04;"- That'd be sick."
01:50:04;01:50:08;"Bernie Sanders 2020 rally in the Bronx with Cardi B."
01:50:08;01:50:10;"- Bacardi and coconut."
01:50:10;01:50:13;"- I'm tired of seeing up and coming rappers"
01:50:13;01:50:16;"get bullied by major corporations"
01:50:16;01:50:19;"such as the Bacardi Rum Corporation"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"deleting her Instagram account."
01:50:21;01:50:24;"- For far too long, Ben and Jerry's"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"has passed over the hip hop community."
01:50:26;01:50:27;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"- And naming ice cream flavors after the,"
01:50:30;01:50:31;"I do a terrible Bernie."
01:50:31;01:50:33;"- Vermont is a very white state."
01:50:33;01:50:37;"- We all love Jerry Garcia."
01:50:37;01:50:39;"- Ben and Jerry's is a very white company."
01:50:39;01:50:43;"It's understandable some aging Caucasian hippies"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"might wanna name their ice creams"
01:50:45;01:50:50;"after people like Jerry Garcia, Dave Matthews Band, Phish."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"- Great groups."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"- All great groups."
01:50:53;01:50:56;"But for far too long,"
01:50:56;01:50:59;"and this hurts me to say as a native New Yorker,"
01:50:59;01:51:04;"the hip hop community has been ignored by Ben and Jerry's."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"Wait, so what's the Cardi B flavor gonna be?"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"- Bacardi and coconut?"
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Is that a thing?"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"- Bacardi and coconut."
01:51:12;01:51:15;"- I am-- - First alcoholic."
01:51:15;01:51:20;"- I am proud to announce the first hip hop Ben and Jerry's"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"featuring Bronx native Cardi B."
01:51:23;01:51:28;"It's Cardi B's Bacardi coconut splash sorbet."
01:51:28;01:51:32;"- Non-dairy."
01:51:32;01:51:38;"- Man, do you think we'll ever get to see"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"Bernie Sanders and Cardi B"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"like do an interview or something?"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"- If Bernie runs, maybe."
01:51:43;01:51:44;"- He might be too old."
01:51:44;01:51:47;"- Yeah, that's a whole separate conversation."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"And maybe that's not her vibe."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"- Cardi B is a Republican."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Doubt it."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"- She's very apolitical."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"- I don't know."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Cardi B is-- - No, I have no idea."
01:51:57;01:51:59;"- She's made a bunch of political statements."
01:51:59;01:51:59;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"You know what's interesting?"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"She hasn't been-- - What sort"
01:52:01;01:52:03;"of political statements?"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"- She was talking about these crazy stuff"
01:52:06;01:52:10;"happening in Libya, a slave trade in Libya,"
01:52:10;01:52:11;"and she's talking about why is the UN not doing,"
01:52:11;01:52:13;"I don't know, I don't actually remember seeing."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"Actually, she recently on social media,"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"she was calling out the haters."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"It's like, by the way, guys,"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"whatever you guys think of me,"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"I graduated from high school and I went to college."
01:52:22;01:52:23;"I chose not to finish college,"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"but don't try to tell me I'm uneducated."
01:52:26;01:52:27;"I don't know what she studied,"
01:52:27;01:52:32;"but we have yet to see Cardi B with this level of stardom"
01:52:32;01:52:35;"during a big election year."
01:52:35;01:52:35;"- Right."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"- So we got something to look forward to."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"- Cardi B and Eddie Vedder."
01:52:38;01:52:41;"- Eddie Vedder."
01:52:41;01:52:44;"- Going to bat for Kirsten Gillibrand."

01:54:12;01:54:15;"Time Crisis"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"on Beast One."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- That was a hell of a top five."
01:54:18;01:54:19;"Shout out to Cardi B."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"America's new favorite pop star."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"Look forward to seeing you and Bernie"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"on the campaign trail in 2020."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"- And Vedder."
01:54:30;01:54:31;"- And Vedder, why not?"
01:54:31;01:54:33;"This land is your land."
01:54:33;01:54:36;"Cardi Sanders, this land is your land"
01:54:36;01:54:38;"featuring Cardi B and Eddie Vedder."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"All right, another great episode, Jake."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"Welcome to 2018."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Oh, and by the way, so Jake,"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"you're claiming that in 2018"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"you're gonna make a playlist for every episode."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- God, that's..."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"- Okay, but--"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"- You know, if we have the idea,"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"or if I have the idea, then I'll do it."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"But sometimes I'm just like,"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"there's not always an organic idea."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"- Okay, so you might not always make one,"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"but you're gonna try to make more--"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"- I'm gonna try to make one for every show."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- More playlists for the fans."
01:55:01;01:55:02;"And this week you made a playlist"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"that the fans can check out on Apple Music."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"- Yep."
01:55:05;01:55:09;"- It's time for Jake's takes on Time Crisis."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"- And what is the theme of this week's playlist?"
01:55:11;01:55:13;"- Classic country."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"- Just classic country."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"- 1964 to 1978."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"- A very tasteful period."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"- It's so tasteful."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"I'm looking through it, I already see a lot of songs"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"that I love."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"- Here's a question, real fast."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"When people make playlists,"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"do they make them with people listening to them"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"in order or on shuffle?"
01:55:30;01:55:33;"'Cause back in the day you'd make a mixtape,"
01:55:33;01:55:35;"and then you would sweat the order."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"But I was making this, and I made the other playlists."
01:55:37;01:55:38;"- Yeah."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- I don't sweat the order."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"- You do sweat the order a little bit."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"I think you wanna come out with your best foot forward."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"People are gonna start at the top."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"- Okay, cool."
01:55:46;01:55:47;"- Well, so, okay, I like this."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"So Jake is showing some of his classic country"
01:55:48;01:55:52;"because we live in very divided times."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"There's still people out there"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"who think they don't like certain genres."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"You get people saying, ""I don't like country."""
01:55:56;01:55:58;"People saying, ""I don't like rap."""
01:55:58;01:55:59;"- Right."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"- Both are two insane statements"
01:56:00;01:56:02;"because those are two genres"
01:56:02;01:56:05;"that are kind of the bedrock of America."
01:56:05;01:56:06;"- True."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"- And also probably one way or another"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"influence almost everything that we listen to."
01:56:09;01:56:14;"- So it's a bright, breezy, fun way to start off the year."
01:56:14;01:56:15;"- Very cool."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"- Let's go out with, she's acting single,"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"I'm drinking doubles."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"- All right, here's Gary Stewart with,"
