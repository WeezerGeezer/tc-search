00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:31;00:33;"Oh"
00:33;00:35;"I"
00:37;00:39;"Oh"
00:39;00:41;"I"
00:41;00:43;"Oh"
00:43;00:45;"I"
00:45;00:47;"Oh"
00:51;00:53;"I"
01:19;01:24;"Time crisis back again gentlemen, I mean"
01:24;01:32;"Yeah, I don't know exactly how to define Nick and Seinfeld I think Jake is the official co-host"
01:32;01:37;"Well, Nick, I would call you an on-air producer. Is that a thing? Yeah"
01:37;01:42;"If anyone ever asked me what I'm doing, I sort of say I'm the Baba Bowie, I guess"
01:42;01:46;"Yeah, cuz he's an on-air producer. We also have off-air producers"
01:46;01:50;"But you gotta have somebody on air and I guess Seinfeld he's the numbers guy"
01:50;01:54;"I'm just in the back office kind of just crunching the numbers tabulating various"
01:54;01:57;"Things and really getting that data"
01:57;02:05;"That that the team needs and just supporting that way Seinfeld. How often are you explaining to like a"
02:05;02:11;"You know an older family member or like your wife's friend or something?"
02:12;02:17;"Your job. I mean obviously you have day jobs as I guess everybody does on TC"
02:17;02:21;"But are you ever in that position where somebody's like so sad about are you working radio?"
02:21;02:24;"It doesn't come up that often, you know"
02:24;02:31;"I guess my work here is sort of like under the Seinfeld 2000 like umbrella of companies and so there's a certain"
02:31;02:38;"Well, I guess a better question would be how often do these people forget about asking you about the your job at a radio show?"
02:38;02:42;"How often do they ask you just about your life is Seinfeld 2000 because even as I said it I realized"
02:42;02:46;"That your family member your girlfriend's friend won't be calling you Seinfeld"
02:46;02:50;"You ever get somebody's being like so what's this whole Seinfeld?"
02:50;02:58;"What is that I mean people people know your real name, right? Can I call you by your first name occasionally, of course, okay"
02:58;03:00;"Yeah, I just would check"
03:00;03:04;"checking cuz you know, one of the amazing things about Seinfeld is that his name is actually a"
03:05;03:11;"combination of Seinfeld cast members names and his first name is Jason and I didn't realize that until"
03:11;03:18;"Well an embarrassingly long time into doing the account like I think I was about a year in when somebody pointed it out or something"
03:18;03:23;"Like that and it was like holy shit. Your name was fully formed from Seinfeld actors"
03:23;03:27;"Yeah, then just anybody who doesn't know his full name is Jason Louis Dreyfus"
03:30;03:35;"Just kidding, I'm not gonna give your whole government name out people can go find it"
03:35;03:40;"But did you see the Larry King interview with Julia Louis Dreyfus where he's like Louis?"
03:40;03:45;"Why do you have a man's name and he's like going on about how she has a man's name and she's like no"
03:45;03:48;"That's half of my last name. What are you talking about? It's a very"
03:48;03:52;"It's a good good video and he's just totally serious"
03:52;03:54;"Yeah, well, he's being that he's doing yeah"
03:54;04:00;"But he's like he's in that weird sort of like Larry King kind of like does he really not know kind of way?"
04:00;04:03;"Right. Anyway, we're kind of bearing the lead here"
04:03;04:08;"The reason that I wanted to you know, talk about your guys official titles on-air producer"
04:08;04:11;"number cruncher on-air accountant is"
04:11;04:13;"because"
04:13;04:18;"The co-host our beloved Jake Longstreth is not here today"
04:18;04:24;"He's got a pretty good reason though. What's that? He's at a Bob. See he's at Home Depot"
04:24;04:31;"Or a Bob Seger concert. He was at Home Depot and at any start struck up a conversation and the guy said I got Seger"
04:31;04:39;"Tickets tonight and Jake said I'm rolling said I got an extra. It's three night. I got an extra burrito nights ago"
04:39;04:44;"I got an extra burrito in my truck and I got an extra ticket to see you seem like a cool dude"
04:44;04:46;"We doing this now. Um"
04:46;04:50;"Jake maybe literally is is a father now"
04:50;04:55;"He gave us a heads up. I think like 36 hours like things were heading in that direction"
04:55;05:02;"and he gave us the go-ahead to share this with the TC community that he's either watching his child be born or"
05:02;05:09;"Holding them in his arms right now or helping out his beloved wife Hannah. They're together at the hospital"
05:09;05:14;"Witnessing the miracle of life wish him Hannah and their child whose name"
05:14;05:17;"Don't know"
05:17;05:23;"All the best. I'm sure plenty to talk about in two weeks, but I was texting with him a little bit"
05:23;05:25;"I think he had a lot of waiting around to do"
05:25;05:28;"He got a burger at the cafeteria"
05:28;05:33;"Cuz you know, I was like saying oh should we like bring you some food or something?"
05:33;05:36;"But of course in kovat times anybody who's had to deal with hospitals"
05:36;05:41;"Whether for good or bad reasons understands like it's just not like it used to be"
05:41;05:45;"Can't get random people rolling up with balloons and a box of Dunkin"
05:46;05:50;"Because there's a lot more rules about who can come in and out of a hospital and what you can bring in"
05:50;05:57;"So anyway, Jake had hit the hospital cafeteria, but he said he had a decent burger said he had eyes on some pasta for dinner"
05:57;06:01;"I asked him if he knew which catering company ran the"
06:01;06:04;"Cafeteria that hospital he wasn't sure but he's gonna look into it"
06:04;06:09;"And then we had a very TCS little back-and-forth finding articles about the biggest"
06:10;06:14;"Institutional catering companies in America, which really could be a whole episode"
06:14;06:22;"Because I've always known this one because they did the catering at my college and I had the next girlfriend is my rack"
06:22;06:29;"Aramark, yep, you remember the Aramark? Yep. So then and of course and actually I had a girlfriend once whose mom"
06:29;06:35;"Worked for them as a nutritionist. I've never totally understood like what the the heart of her job"
06:35;06:37;"Maybe it was just analyzing like the food stuff they do"
06:38;06:43;"But Aramark's number one in the US and when you look at like what they do, let me pull up the picture"
06:43;06:45;"I was text texting Jake"
06:45;06:52;"These are their major segments serve just so that because we probably have some people listening say institutional catering kind of get it"
06:52;06:54;"But like yeah, what is that besides hospitals?"
06:54;07:02;"So for Aramark sports and entertainment 19% because they're probably holding down all sorts of bullsh*t at arenas and stadiums"
07:02;07:04;"And you know like the VIP Club"
07:05;07:11;"Some football stadium or you know, there's a lot of food dealing with the nachos at Staples Center some sh*t like that"
07:11;07:16;"That takes like a big institutional company to do so sports and entertainment 19%"
07:16;07:20;"B&I 16% actually have no idea what that is. What do you think B&I is?"
07:20;07:23;"Seinfeld guy get a letters crunch? Oh"
07:23;07:29;"Business and industry maybe that could be the cafeteria at a factory or a big office building or something"
07:29;07:33;"Aramark was the supplier for"
07:33;07:36;"Turner for Adult Swim Cartoon Network. They were the in-house"
07:36;07:38;"deli"
07:38;07:44;"Because you went to the Aramark deli and this is back when it's if people who don't know Nick had an illustrious career as a"
07:44;07:46;"producer at an adult swim in"
07:46;07:51;"The classic era working on all sorts of cool sh*t Tim and Eric Eric Andre all that stuff"
07:51;07:55;"And so you lived in Atlanta at that time. So this is there was a deli in the Atlanta"
07:55;08:01;"Campus is this in like the the CNN same building as CNN? No, so there's the CNN Center"
08:01;08:08;"Yeah, where they'll do tours and things like that and that's where CNN, you know, the actual sort of live broadcast takes place"
08:08;08:14;"Yeah, then there's the Turner campus, which was Ted Turner's old campus"
08:14;08:18;"Which is where they actually did the wrestling and maybe where CNN, you know"
08:18;08:23;"The local news first started that's in Midtown and it was sort of an old mansion and Ted Turner"
08:23;08:28;"Actually lived there while the campus with everyone else working and then across the streets"
08:28;08:32;"they bought an old carpet factory, which"
08:32;08:41;"Was turned into the sort of redheaded stepchild adult swim. So it was like off campus, but right that's TMC"
08:41;08:46;"William Street Turner Classic William Street, but Turner Classic Movies Cartoon Network TBS"
08:46;08:48;"Those were all on the main campus"
08:48;08:51;"Probably with a very large Aramark"
08:51;08:57;"Was it like some college where you and the adult swim guys would be like you want to hit the deli and just be like?"
08:57;09:01;"I don't know. Maybe we should walk extra 10 minutes to go to like the the big cafeteria"
09:01;09:06;"Over on main campus. Yeah, or like it was, you know"
09:06;09:12;"Going to school in New York where you're like, do you want to eat at the Aramark and get a turkey sandwich?"
09:12;09:15;"Or do you want to walk five minutes to like?"
09:15;09:17;"Get a falafel"
09:17;09:22;"Right, you know fair enough. So I mean you just leave you do it or do we just want to leave the building?"
09:22;09:24;"I mean there is something as you know in working"
09:24;09:28;"Seinfeld may know this from his you know in one of his industry"
09:28;09:33;"Jobs is that there's something about when you're so busy. You just have to eat on"
09:33;09:38;"Camp or in the building. There's sort of a depressing vibe because you're like I'm so busy"
09:38;09:42;"I literally just can't go get some fresh air. I can't walk outside. Yeah, you don't get"
09:42;09:47;"You don't get a real lunch. Yeah, or you may need to work work through lunch"
09:47;09:52;"So you it's the proximity is really convenient too because you can't yeah just got your computer"
09:52;09:55;"It's like that. It's like that Gia Tolentino sitting at your desk"
09:55;10:00;"Shoveling a chopped salad into your mouth as you like do emails. It's a strong choice"
10:00;10:02;"my friend"
10:02;10:08;"For you to show up with the head to land and it's good to see you're in town"
10:08;10:12;"I had it"
10:12;10:16;"You were around and look at you rolling on through"
10:16;10:19;"Sure"
10:19;10:27;"Would you help me unload my van I've been busting my ass doing the best I can"
10:29;10:31;"Don't know how to feel"
10:31;10:35;"If my gratefulness is taking over"
10:35;10:38;"It's a hell of a deal"
10:38;10:41;"like a horseshoe"
10:41;10:46;"So after BNI you've college and university so"
10:46;10:53;"14% 14% health care because again hospitals they got to cook up a lot of food and then you get to"
10:54;10:57;"Corrections 14% also holding it down in prisons"
10:57;11:00;"Aramark is cooking up good food"
11:00;11:07;"for the prison industrial complex and then 10% vending OCS and then K through 12 9%"
11:07;11:14;"So more education, so it's a big weird world of institutional catering. You're doing everything from prisons to sports to"
11:14;11:17;"education actually"
11:17;11:21;"It's a pretty good segue because that's how our next guest"
11:21;11:25;"Robert Rosenberg and I really wish Jake was here for this, but we're"
11:25;11:29;"Keeping you in our thoughts Jake sending good vibes. Can't wait for you to be back"
11:29;11:36;"But Robert Rosenberg is coming on the program and as people know he wrote my favorite book of the year so far"
11:36;11:38;"I'll probably read some more books"
11:38;11:40;"But my favorite book of the year so far"
11:40;11:44;"Which is called around the corner around the world and this is a book telling his story"
11:44;11:49;"About being the CEO of Dunkin Donuts for 35 years when he took it over"
11:49;11:54;"It was a company that his father started that owned a bunch of Dunkin Donuts"
11:54;12:01;"But also was kind of came out of the industrial catering business. So he knows a thing or two about that"
12:01;12:07;"It's a real honor to have him on the show. I mean, this is I think one of our most illustrious guests ever"
12:07;12:11;"For all the times we've talked about Dunkin Donuts and fast food"
12:11;12:16;"We've never had a real power player from that world on the show. So I can't wait to talk to him"
12:16;12:21;"We're gonna we're gonna also have Bayo on the show, right? Oh, yeah Bayo's coming through later, too"
12:21;12:23;"So yeah, it's a pretty stacked episode. So stacked it"
12:23;12:29;"Maybe when we get Robert Rosenberg on the program will be like honestly, you're a natural co-host Robert"
12:29;12:35;"Maybe second chair. You can be the second chair. Maybe we hit up Jake and Jake's like honestly fatherhood"
12:35;12:41;"It's got me thinking differently. I feel like I should only be doing one TC a month be like Jake"
12:41;12:43;"That's absolutely heartbreaking. But luckily"
12:44;12:49;"Robert M. Rosenberg, how about none? Cuz we got Robert Rosenberg"
12:49;12:52;"You're fired. I"
12:52;12:59;"Wonder if Jake wants any paternity leave. I mean, we'll see he's got a great question. He's got two weeks"
12:59;13:02;"Oh, we're asking for Jake is a few hours"
13:02;13:09;"Maybe his baby will just be like a deep sleeper. Jake just be cradling his little infant child in his arms"
13:09;13:11;"just very subtly"
13:11;13:18;"Implanting their their mind with like weird inside jokes and references. That'll kind of like blossom and 15 years from now"
13:18;13:23;"We could also move the recording time to like 1 a.m. Or something. Oh"
13:23;13:26;"Yeah"
13:26;13:28;"Baby hours"
13:28;13:30;"I was just thinking about"
13:30;13:36;"Aramark and how if they cover so much of your daily life if there was anyone it was sort of like the room"
13:36;13:39;"But for food like they just got their whole life"
13:39;13:44;"They're like 20 something years old and they've never gotten out of the Aramark system"
13:44;13:48;"Like they've never had non Aramark food, you know, it just covered every element of their life"
13:48;13:50;"Oh, I think that's totally possible"
13:50;13:56;"I could totally imagine like at the Aramark like board meeting somebody makes a sentimental video"
13:56;14:01;"that's like a little kid and their k-12 experience was Aramark catered and then they get a"
14:02;14:07;"Then it's like then you know what happened to that kid they became the star center for the Detroit Pistons"
14:07;14:09;"and then they're like at the arena and"
14:09;14:16;"And they're just like eating all the food at the arena and then after their great career in basketball"
14:16;14:21;"They move into the business world as a lot of athletes do and then they're like hitting the yeah"
14:21;14:27;"Maybe they get a job for Turner. They're doing basketball commentary in Atlanta. They're in CNN Center"
14:27;14:31;"They're in CNN Center, and then they're eating all that good food there"
14:31;14:36;"Maybe they go to prison and they're eating Aramark food in prison, but it's for it's like"
14:36;14:43;"It's a trumped-up charge. We want to believe in this person. It's like totally unfair, but the whole time they're in prison"
14:43;14:47;"It's a terrible experience, but the only good thing was the food then they get out fully exonerated"
14:47;14:49;"I have to go to the hospital"
14:49;14:54;"Eating some good food and then eventually they're in a nursing home. That's Aramark catered"
14:55;15:01;"Literally from the cradle to it's like Aramark like presents a boy's life. That sounds like an Aramark Super Bowl commercial"
15:01;15:07;"You're just like at the end just like Aramark and everybody at home. Just like what the is Aramark?"
15:07;15:10;"I don't know, but I've got a very warm feeling towards it"
15:10;15:15;"Through the ups and downs of life Aramark. Well, that always is the case, right?"
15:15;15:20;"There's always one or two Super Bowl commercials where you're like, it's not a forward-facing company"
15:20;15:24;"Yeah, not a bank but something to go. I don't even understand what that is"
15:24;15:29;"That's much more of a behind-the-scenes or software company or something. I feel you're like, I don't I don't even know what that is"
15:29;15:34;"Like yeah, what's the point or something? Yeah, what's the point of them advertising? I remember at a certain point"
15:34;15:37;"It must have been PR stuff, but the much-hated coke"
15:37;15:43;"Industries the infamous coke brothers the right-wing donors. They started doing these ads that were just kind of like"
15:43;15:50;"Yeah, children smiling and people high-fiving. It's like coke industries. You're just like what are you telling the world right now?"
15:51;15:56;"Um, but anyway, Robert Rosenberg will be no stranger to effective advertising"
15:56;16:02;"He helmed Dunkin Donuts during the Fred the Baker era that we've talked about the time to make the donuts era"
16:02;16:05;"Well, let's get him on the horn"
16:05;16:18;"Hey Robert, hey, welcome to time crisis you're on with Ezra Nick and Seinfeld"
16:19;16:20;"Terrific"
16:20;16:23;"Hi, everybody. How are you? We're great. We're so glad you could come on the show"
16:23;16:27;"We're all big fans really enjoyed the book and of course fans of Dunkin Donuts"
16:27;16:35;"I guess my first question is what's the proper way to address you? You're a professor now Bob. Should we call you not professor?"
16:35;16:38;"Bob"
16:38;16:45;"Just Bob, okay, Bob. We were just talking about the company Aramark. You must be pretty familiar with them"
16:45;16:48;"I'd imagine a little bit. Yes, I am"
16:48;16:55;"I was thinking about that that your family business before it became full-on all Duncan all the time kind of started in"
16:55;16:57;"the industrial catering world"
16:57;17:00;"Yeah, exactly"
17:00;17:06;"We actually in those years when I when I started to divest of that business is when I took over"
17:06;17:12;"I think I actually spoke to David Davidson and can't remember the other guys named Bill Fishman"
17:12;17:14;"Who were the founders of a RA?"
17:15;17:19;"Where they do the cell part of my industrial feeding business, but I'm helping them"
17:19;17:23;"We sold it to canteen, but I did talk to a RA and then I know the Joe"
17:23;17:26;"Newhouse new burger Joe Newberg"
17:26;17:31;"They can took it over and ran it for period of time to John Parkinson was vice chairman"
17:31;17:36;"So I do know the company somewhat but from a distance when your father gave you the reins of this company"
17:36;17:42;"You had this instinct to divest from the world of industrial catering which was changing at the time"
17:42;17:50;"But you know clearly had its upsides too because you had this bigger belief in the the Dunkin Donuts side of the business"
17:50;17:54;"Yeah, I actually while I was in business school and when I went away to college"
17:54;17:57;"Basically, the business was pretty much"
17:57;18:05;"Industrial feeding these trucks that went around the factory sites small factory sites and office sites and there were a few donut shops"
18:05;18:06;"plain and simple"
18:06;18:14;"When I came back my father and my uncle for Parkinson broken up and my father and my uncle started a competitive business called. Mr"
18:14;18:15;"Donut"
18:15;18:19;"With just one of the divisions and my father then diversified the company. My father was"
18:19;18:27;"Great entrepreneur an eighth grade educated guy, but a real knack for starting businesses and great with ideas"
18:27;18:29;"but while in school"
18:29;18:35;"It came to the conclusion that company created called Universal Food System for these eight little businesses"
18:36;18:38;"Really could just as much falter from"
18:38;18:43;"overeating and indigestion having too much on your plate as opposed to starvation"
18:43;18:45;"we're not enough resources and"
18:45;18:49;"It gave me the idea that while I was in school"
18:49;18:53;"I wrote papers and thought a lot about what I thought was right for the company"
18:53;18:56;"My dad was so frustrated that my uncle was overtaking"
18:56;19:01;"Then he actually took me to New York while I was in my second year business school"
19:02;19:05;"While I was trying to sell the business for a million and a half bucks"
19:05;19:08;"And he couldn't get it because he was only earning a hundred thousand dollars"
19:08;19:13;"not insignificant some of money, but not enough to command a million and a half dollars and"
19:13;19:22;"You always wanted to be a millionaire. He was aged 47 healthy. I was 25 when I got out of school. He turned to me"
19:22;19:28;"Within days and I graduated and asked me if I would take over the business"
19:28;19:32;"And you could imagine a 25 year old it was kind of a breathtaking request"
19:32;19:40;"But my idea was if it was for mothers in school that I focus on the only business that we had in his portfolio"
19:40;19:47;"These little portfolio businesses was this chain that sold coffee and donuts and a lot of them were like diners"
19:47;19:51;"They sold breakfast lunch hot dog and burgers scrambled eggs"
19:51;19:58;"But they were they were really quite diversified in terms of the menu and store design numbers of seats and everything"
19:58;20:03;"So basically what we did is we we we niche down we focused we basically"
20:03;20:06;"started to"
20:06;20:08;"Focus on the one business and sold off slowly"
20:08;20:15;"But surely it closed the others down the other seven or eight little businesses he had and focused on one and that worked"
20:15;20:18;"Incredibly well for the first five years"
20:18;20:21;"the time I took over in"
20:21;20:25;"1963 to 1968 we went public"
20:25;20:31;"Try to make my dad the millionaire. He always wanted a band. We overwhelmingly successful and then"
20:31;20:34;"Basically"
20:34;20:36;"Made a tragic mistake"
20:36;20:41;"Changed the focus began to do the very same thing my dad they began to diversify the company"
20:41;20:45;"Unfocused and rented to deep deep trouble"
20:45;20:52;"Part two of the book 1969 to 73 is called a fall from grace"
20:54;20:59;"Yeah, you get you get into some hairy situations and there's a lot of ups and downs in the in the story"
20:59;21:03;"But I'm very interested in this these early days. I mean so you had this brilliant idea"
21:03;21:07;"Dad gives you the family business age 25"
21:07;21:11;"Very young to be running a big business and you had this"
21:11;21:17;"What turned out to be a totally right impulse to get rid of all the extraneous elements of the business drill down on Duncan"
21:17;21:20;"So can you kind of take us back?"
21:20;21:24;"1963 what was just generally"
21:24;21:26;"the coffee and donut scene in"
21:26;21:34;"America or at least in Boston like where was the average person getting coffee outside of their house?"
21:34;21:37;"mostly in diners and diner at"
21:37;21:41;"Most people took it at home and there wasn't a lot of people in the breakfast business"
21:41;21:44;"The only chain restaurant that existed was Howard Johnson"
21:44;21:49;"Which was down the street and Wallace the National Mar headquarters in Quincy, Massachusetts"
21:50;21:55;"Nearby and it was their notion of franchising and their notion of"
21:55;22:01;"Standardization that there's a lot of the inspiration for what gave us the inference in the early years, right?"
22:01;22:06;"It's all we should actually start with 28 varieties of donuts"
22:06;22:09;"Because they had 28 varieties of ice cream. It wasn't till later"
22:09;22:16;"I changed it to 52 ones every week in a year very much patterned after the only real competitor we had and"
22:17;22:22;"Most people don't realize it because today is such a different world but coffee"
22:22;22:24;"and back"
22:24;22:28;"After the Second World War was on like a 50-year decline"
22:28;22:33;"In terms of people that were taking an average person drank something like 40 gallons of coffee a year"
22:33;22:36;"1945 and by the time was"
22:36;22:42;"1995 they basically were down to 20 because the coffee was so bad"
22:42;22:47;"I saw that statistic in your book and it just seems so strange because my understanding is"
22:47;22:52;"Was that people drink more coffee these days because you're surrounded by it"
22:52;22:59;"So when you say so the average American drank twice as many gallons of coffee in the 40s versus the 90s"
22:59;23:03;"Is that cuz like the coffee was weaker or just coffee got less popular?"
23:03;23:08;"So it was bad everybody was selling cheap coffee. So you you never you probably don't remember you"
23:08;23:14;"But Nescafe instant coffee was the rage and it was a terrible product"
23:14;23:19;"There was nothing more than colored water and Maxwell house and other things that we using robusta beans"
23:19;23:25;"And it was a price war basically sold to supermarkets and kid cans that people had to make their own beverages"
23:25;23:26;"so"
23:26;23:33;"Between the fact that the product was inferior and the fact that cold beverages like cold is and other ways of getting canapé"
23:33;23:40;"We're just basically killing that business. So we were really the only ones to focus on sort of coffee and"
23:41;23:47;"That's the centerpiece of our business. No one else had done that and we really didn't have a lot of competition and"
23:47;23:50;"New England where we started as we moved out"
23:50;23:55;"We started to encounter later years more and more competition"
23:55;24:01;"But mostly from convenience stores because that was a big competitor for where people are buying their morning coffee on the way to work"
24:01;24:03;"I've got to go to Melfi"
24:03;24:06;"from there to Leland"
24:06;24:08;"I want to see my baby"
24:08;24:10;"by the lovely spoon"
24:11;24:13;"bottle of his food"
24:13;24:17;"I'm just got to have"
24:17;24:20;"Yes, loving"
24:20;24:22;"1963 you take over you're focusing on coffee in"
24:22;24:29;"1963 you could you even get a to-go cup at Dunkin Donuts or you sat down and drank it out of a porcelain cup"
24:29;24:35;"All we sold was a six ounce to-go cup a paper cup"
24:35;24:42;"Cardboard cup in a six ounce size and a coffee and a porcelain cup over the counter in the store"
24:42;24:46;"And that and those were the only that was the only way we sold a five six ounce cup of coffee"
24:46;24:52;"And at the time I think we were selling it for dime and donuts were selling for something like 55 cents a dozen"
24:52;24:56;"right, so there's only one to-go coffee product and"
24:56;25:02;"So if you're saying the coffee was such trash back then you come in you really start thinking about the beans"
25:02;25:06;"Make sure it's a good cup of coffee when you took the reins and local"
25:06;25:12;"Massachusetts people start coming to Dunkin Donuts were you getting feedback like people were having the best cup of coffee of their life"
25:12;25:18;"Yes. Yes. This is a game changer. It was more than that. That was also the ability"
25:18;25:24;"We started with a great product and the first iteration like most businesses that start up"
25:24;25:26;"They're generally not successful right out of the gate"
25:26;25:32;"Generally takes two or three times before you really get your stride and learn how to do it, right?"
25:32;25:36;"The first business was called open kettle is just a stucco store with no windows"
25:36;25:41;"The competitor forced us to rip that store down and build a brand new store with a brand new name"
25:41;25:46;"Change it from open kettle to Dunkin Donuts and the sales are like a thousand dollars a week"
25:46;25:53;"Which would probably be the same as most donut shops in Massachusetts or probably 1,500 of them when we started in"
25:53;25:58;"1950 and it was more than just the product"
25:58;26:06;"It was acting and looking important putting in sort of a California style fishbowl effect of the building a different kind of name"
26:06;26:10;"So people can look in and see what was going on and see the variety of product how we were really"
26:10;26:15;"Merchandising with such a full hand and we acted and looked important"
26:15;26:21;"And I think that had a role too and how we packaged the business that had something to do with its success"
26:21;26:24;"We ran away from that when I went away to college when I came back"
26:24;26:28;"I basically went back to the business that my father had started but moved away from"
26:28;26:34;"and he had left the business and the management in the hands of other people and"
26:34;26:40;"They were losing faith and confidence and a business is focusing on a great cup of coffee and a donut"
26:40;26:46;"And I just went back to that and got rid of the other businesses and that was a format that served us very well"
26:46;26:49;"Until I lost it"
26:49;26:55;"in the early 1970s. Well, so let's talk a little bit about the whole family squabble with"
26:55;27:00;"Mr. Donut, so I talked a little bit about this in the last episode"
27:00;27:04;"So our listeners are somewhat familiar, but like you said your father and your uncle ran the business"
27:04;27:12;"They have a falling out your uncle starts. Mr. Donut. Your father is kind of obsessed with Duncan overtaking"
27:12;27:18;"Mr. Donut, which kind of had a bit of a head start and that becomes a focus of yours as well"
27:18;27:25;"It couldn't help but notice we were talking about inspire brands recently that currently Duncan Donuts and Mr"
27:25;27:31;"Donut are owned by the same company. Is this the first time that ever happened? I knew you came close in the 80s"
27:31;27:36;"No, basically we were owned by Allied Lions then called Allied to Mac"
27:36;27:42;"I had to find a white knight in it in the end of the 80s in the early 1990s to fend off a hostile takeover"
27:42;27:46;"And then we were owned by private equity companies and then we're publicly owned again"
27:46;27:54;"And now we just recently sold the business for 11 point something billion dollars to inspire and basically they don't own the mr"
27:54;28:00;"Donut brand we converted the mr. Donut stores. We bought to Duncan. Mr. Donut only exists"
28:00;28:05;"I think in Asia and maybe a few countries in in Europe, but doesn't exist in the United States"
28:05;28:11;"I don't think to any extent maybe one or two stores. Yeah, the final nail in the coffin for mr"
28:11;28:13;"Donut us was the inspire"
28:13;28:18;"Purchase no. No, it was I bought the mr. Donut stores in 1990 as part of a"
28:18;28:25;"Effort to fend off a hostile predator. Oh, right. I basically we badged them to rename them into into Duncan"
28:25;28:29;"Mr. Donut had already sold off their rights to the Japanese franchisee"
28:29;28:34;"Who then took the business and started to grow it in Asia, but for the United States"
28:34;28:41;"I bought all the 550 stores in 1990 and then started to rebadge them to Duncan very successful and really"
28:41;28:46;"Gave you some idea that experiment in terms of the real value of a brand"
28:46;28:50;"It's a very interesting story and most people talk about branding and brands are important"
28:50;28:58;"But we have real graphic evidence and a way of measuring exactly how important the value is a branded"
28:58;29:04;"So we went to the mr. Donut franchise owners and asked them same location same basic business"
29:04;29:10;"$25,000 remodeling took the mr. Donut signed out put a Duncan sign up Duncan was a much stronger brand"
29:11;29:14;"And a lot of the markets and sales went up 40%"
29:14;29:20;"Wow in one market Toronto where there were no no Duncan's and a few misters when I tried it"
29:20;29:24;"Sales went actually down by 10% so we stopped doing that"
29:24;29:30;"But fundamentally I concluded that the value of a brand was was worth about 50% of the bottom of the store"
29:30;29:36;"That's amazing. And so when that happened in the 90s and graphical, you know, you put the"
29:36;29:43;"Duncan signage up. Did you feel like it was the end of an epic story that of the donut wars?"
29:43;29:45;"Yes"
29:45;29:50;"Was it emotional when you finally squashed? Mr. Donut?"
29:50;29:58;"Actually the franchise my uncle and my cousin who was running the business"
29:58;30:02;"Who was also my counselor at camp when I was a kid?"
30:02;30:10;"They had sold their business in 68 when we went public so the donut wars at least as a family enterprise a family activity"
30:10;30:15;"Really had an end of a chapter then and then we competed again when it was part of international"
30:15;30:22;"Multifoods and that's who I bought the business from a large Minneapolis Miller a flour Miller. There was a supplier to mr"
30:22;30:27;"Donut and I bought the business then and then that was sort of the very end of it"
30:27;30:30;"Then the brand disappeared and in that space was converted to Duncan's"
30:30;30:35;"I see it was an end of an era, but it actually came in two different stages"
30:35;30:40;"Well, so back to 1963 just to really understand the vibe of when things were starting"
30:40;30:45;"So you're providing a better cup of coffee than a lot of regular people had had in their whole life"
30:45;30:51;"Now obviously today you can go to Dunkin Donuts and I saw they're about to drop matcha lattes"
30:51;30:57;"There is an infinite number of Charlie D'Amelio just on tick-tock is just to do some new beverage today"
30:58;31:03;"Tell me cold foam on top of her favorite drink. Oh, they introduced it on tick-tock"
31:03;31:06;"Yeah"
31:06;31:13;"My joint tick-tock was to follow her and her introduction of Dunkin products. She's got more hits than anybody"
31:13;31:18;"Oh, yeah, Charlie D'Amelio. She's really big on tick-tock. I've heard the name. Okay, so you got cold foam"
31:18;31:20;"You got all these things but back in 1963"
31:20;31:25;"I'm also just curious about the lay of the land generally your regular guy in Boston"
31:25;31:29;"How often are you having a cappuccino your regular Boston guy?"
31:29;31:35;"1963 ever no, no only what only if you're Italian no"
31:35;31:41;"Not even then I don't even think if you've ever been a North and you're Bob Rosenberg"
31:41;31:48;"25 year old Harvard business grad 1963 you're having zero cappuccinos in your life in that era"
31:48;31:52;"There are cappuccino exactly. Yeah, what about iced coffee?"
31:53;31:59;"Iced coffee most people would be amazed when I tell you the iced coffee wasn't even a product"
31:59;32:01;"It existed in one state in"
32:01;32:04;"1990 and the state of Rhode Island as far as I knew"
32:04;32:09;"Those are the only people that drank iced coffee until Duncan brought it on to the scene"
32:09;32:21;"I'm thinking of the lady who got lost along the way"
32:22;32:27;"And if I don't stop this trembling hand from reaching for the phone"
32:27;32:32;"I'll be reaching for the bottle before this day is done"
32:32;32:37;"one of the kind of dramatic parts of your story and you alluded to it is the"
32:37;32:42;"How you guys had to scramble to fend off a hostile takeover?"
32:42;32:49;"From a Canadian company in the late 80s and that meant that if I understand correctly you needed to find another buyer"
32:50;32:51;"so you had to"
32:51;32:55;"Go through hell to like sell the brand sounds like it's a very stressful time for you"
32:55;32:59;"and so you describe in the book that the 80s was the time when this kind of"
32:59;33:04;"relatively new concept came into vogue of the hostile takeover as"
33:04;33:09;"You describe this very stressful moment in the light in your life in the life of the company"
33:09;33:15;"I couldn't help but wonder and I'd like for you to fill in some of the the human element of it as a guy"
33:15;33:18;"Who obviously has always been interested in business a business school graduate?"
33:18;33:23;"but somebody who also enjoys getting in the weeds on the flavors of"
33:23;33:27;"Donuts and meeting the franchisees and talking about locations and coffee"
33:27;33:32;"When you're a guy who's selling coffee and donuts and then one day you're suddenly dealing with"
33:32;33:39;"International finance and just like almost like faceless corporations trying to squeeze your stock"
33:39;33:43;"Did you ever in that moment think like how the hell did I get here?"
33:43;33:49;"Like what is like that must have been such a crazy time for like the whole world as like finance was changing and the business"
33:49;33:52;"Was changing can you paint a picture for us what that felt like?"
33:52;33:54;"It was horrible"
33:54;33:56;"It was a new world"
33:56;33:58;"Required me to learn new things"
33:58;34:03;"Required us to have to change my team and I it was it was a"
34:03;34:09;"Excruciating and I love the business love the franchises and quite truthfully"
34:09;34:16;"thought that the the green mailer the financier from Canada who is making an attempt to buy the business and"
34:16;34:20;"Corner the stock and forcing us to do these kind of things"
34:20;34:23;"Basically wasn't a satisfactory owner"
34:23;34:30;"I think he stumbled into this as part of the financial engineering was taking place in that era and easy money and Michael"
34:30;34:31;"Milk coming"
34:31;34:38;"Lambert was a big financier who made money available with junk bonds to make hostile takeovers"
34:38;34:42;"Available impossible and and it happened all around Boston"
34:42;34:47;"It was an excruciating time for lots of brands lots of companies and it was for us and for me particularly"
34:47;34:55;"And and quite truthfully had we not found a white knight in England to buy the company after a seven month"
34:55;34:59;"Battle of moving counter moves is kind of a real page-turner in the book"
34:59;35:08;"High finance he actually had bought a bank and I think New York Lincoln Savings and a bought Union Gas in Toronto"
35:08;35:14;"and and those have had reversals and lost hundreds of millions of dollars and he was"
35:14;35:19;"Retirement had he been successful and ended up in the business"
35:19;35:22;"I think that would have been the end of the business and our franchisees"
35:22;35:27;"so it really was a life-or-death kind of moment for us and I felt it keenly and"
35:27;35:34;"Did everything within our power all of us to basically try to save the company and luckily at one minute to midnight"
35:35;35:40;"After exhausting all kinds of possibilities. We found exactly the right buyer at the right time"
35:40;35:48;"They were a company that I've been acting as a friendly buyer for other brands the Hatch family in Canada and higher market"
35:48;35:54;"Liquor company, but they've also no liquor business and their pubs and a lot of bakery operations"
35:54;36:00;"Oh Joe Lyons corner houses in the UK and I actually was comfortable with them and"
36:01;36:07;"Continued and stayed on for another nine years ran that brand and ran Baskin Robbins for them as well. And so we did"
36:07;36:09;"was"
36:09;36:15;"It was a hair raising seven or eight months of a high wire act that could have spelled it the difference between life or death"
36:15;36:17;"For our business. Yeah, I can imagine"
36:17;36:23;"It's not not what you bargained for back when you're taking over the donut business that one day you'd be flying around the world"
36:23;36:27;"I think though the fact is as I look back and as I wrote but"
36:28;36:33;"There were all kinds of areas. I broke into six areas and the book each of them required different responses"
36:33;36:39;"It was a constant evolution. I had to learn new things new ways of behaving"
36:39;36:45;"They now call it emotional intelligence. I didn't come to the job that way. I was lucky. I thought of a great school"
36:45;36:49;"My father was a smart guy and put us in the right industry"
36:49;36:55;"And the right kind of combination of factors early on for early success"
36:55;37:00;"If that early success then created failure almost saying I got fired"
37:00;37:03;"I had to talk my way back into my job after the 70s"
37:03;37:10;"Required constant adaptation constant growing learning new things if you talk about the"
37:10;37:17;"Coffee business will change if you're going to be involved in anything whether it's music or whether it's gonna be business"
37:17;37:24;"You basically have to be adaptable because the consumers constantly changing the competition. It's constantly changing technology"
37:24;37:30;"It's constantly changing and that means that you have to keep adapting and if you're not prepared to do that"
37:30;37:35;"That's why the average length of tenure for CEO is historically five years"
37:35;37:39;"It basically runs out of life cycle because things are moving so quickly"
37:39;37:45;"And if you're not prepared to learn new steps and like new music, so an indie pop"
37:45;37:51;"You know, basically you have to make some adaptations you have to change and that will change again"
37:51;37:58;"Who would have a guess you know back in the 70s or 80s that rap would be a very popular?"
37:58;38:02;"Music movement, but it captured the imagination of public, right?"
38:02;38:07;"You have to simultaneously be aware of what's changing and what people are into and then also"
38:07;38:11;"Aware be aware of your lane and what you can do because yeah"
38:11;38:16;"That's the interesting paradox that you talk about in the book. Sometimes is like"
38:16;38:23;"Trying to stay adaptable but also realizing the business can't be all things to all people and there been many times"
38:23;38:29;"You've kind of tightened things up, which I think there's a lot to learn from you. Hey, they're right. That's the tension and some of the"
38:29;38:34;"Management of leadership is the difference between exploration and exploitation"
38:34;38:42;"So the exploration is trying new things and exploitation is sort of enhancing what you already have the diamond in the rough"
38:42;38:49;"You're already existing capabilities and skills and it seemed to me that every time I got into trouble I was doing more experimentation"
38:49;38:56;"Exploitation and it's a delicate balance and that's exactly what you said staying in the lane versus moving away"
38:56;39:02;"I I found that that was always a constant tension a constant challenge and you gotta get it, right?"
39:02;39:06;"And it's kind of a again a high wire act. Sometimes I didn't get it, right?"
39:06;39:08;"Yeah, that makes me think of something"
39:08;39:12;"So how much of an eye are you keeping on like the day-to-day?"
39:12;39:17;"Decision-making on in Duncan now not so much in Duncan now"
39:17;39:22;"Although you know when I started to write the book I was working with the management of the company"
39:22;39:24;"I wanted their support and excitement helped me"
39:24;39:30;"You know make sure the facts were right and things that I was quoting that may have changed in the time"
39:30;39:35;"But basically I keep a very keen eye on the industry. I bought all of them"
39:35;39:39;"Information that's available on the restaurant industry away from home industry"
39:39;39:45;"Franchising so I keep very much up-to-date in terms of what's happening and I follow any news on Duncan"
39:45;39:51;"That's right. Follow Duncan. I follow Sonic. I follow Domino's. I follow companies rise on the board"
39:51;39:54;"I follow the industry and get nation's restaurant news every day"
39:54;39:59;"I get deep dive on the food service industry and I'm constantly reading and saving"
39:59;40:01;"because I get calls and I"
40:02;40:08;"Have to stay abreast of what's happening and it is changing the whole pandemic change the industry"
40:08;40:12;"Telescoped it by five or ten years bang overnight, right?"
40:12;40:18;"I can only imagine how much the the other pandemic has changed the outlook for a lot of businesses national restaurant associations"
40:18;40:24;"There's ten or fifteen percent. There's six hundred fifty thousand restaurants in that it says they said ten or fifteen percent"
40:24;40:26;"I'm gonna close it off a hundred fifty thousand restaurants"
40:26;40:31;"That's a million and a half people can be out of work for those that weren't able to go through"
40:32;40:35;"Ordering online pick up drive-thrus"
40:35;40:40;"The ways to make their product available any platform available"
40:40;40:45;"I'm gonna have trouble and those who were able to plan ahead that took advantage of the digital age"
40:45;40:49;"I'm gonna flourish when the dusk leaves because again these people still gonna have to go out to eat"
40:49;40:54;"I'm still gonna want food and so it's probably gonna fall to a number of chains that exist"
40:54;40:59;"It's the ritual get richer and I think the poor will really suffer"
41:00;41:04;"Unfortunately, yeah, very unfortunate local restaurant that they go to the local diner"
41:04;41:10;"You know, a lot of those people aren't gonna make it starts even appreciate how much the landscape has changed"
41:10;41:13;"I think until maybe later this year when more people are returning to normal life"
41:13;41:19;"They'll really encounter this landscape in a kind of visceral way and I think it'll be shocking for a lot of people"
41:19;41:25;"On a somewhat lighter note though in terms of changing and adapting we noticed that avocado"
41:26;41:34;"Toast is now going to be on the menu at Dunkin Donuts, which is definitely a far cry from eat coffee and donuts"
41:34;41:38;"But have you been following that? I'm curious about basically they took the name donuts off"
41:38;41:44;"The beverages and then slowly but surely the nature of the business when I just started"
41:44;41:45;"I didn't have a lot of money for research"
41:45;41:52;"my guess was that 60 or 70 percent of the business was donuts and 30 or 40 percent with beverages and"
41:53;41:57;"over the years that just got in worst especially when I changed the configuration of the stores and"
41:57;42:02;"went away from the question of our counter and porcelain cups and went to self-service and"
42:02;42:07;"Finally woke up and basically with the beverage business and in early 90s"
42:07;42:12;"That was clearly changing and we got rid of Fred the Baker kind of at the donut commercial so successful"
42:12;42:18;"We want all those Cleo's great commercials and now America runs on Duncan is the thing"
42:18;42:22;"It's a great thing that they use but basically the business has transitioned"
42:22;42:25;"so they took the name Duncan's the name don't it's off and"
42:25;42:33;"Basically began to become a way station for snacks and be able to provide beverages and snacks"
42:33;42:35;"Throughout the day people snack a lot"
42:35;42:42;"All people take meals differently than they did 50 or 60 years ago the world how they move around and much more mobile"
42:42;42:46;"And I think that they've adapted themselves that some of those items will stick"
42:46;42:51;"Some of them might not but but I think it's the right move and that's how they've adapted the business"
42:51;42:57;"Right, it's spot-on whether or not avocado toast becomes a future staple of Dunkin Donuts"
42:57;43:01;"Basically, what you're saying is it's coffee and snacks. So they're trying different snacks"
43:01;43:06;"We'll see which ones work, but it's not a coffee and donuts business anymore"
43:06;43:11;"Exactly, right and they take the name down. It's off and I agree with that. They call me those when they did it"
43:11;43:16;"It was an idea we toyed with in 1990 when we moved the way we realized that we were really a burger"
43:17;43:21;"Now primarily and we toyed with that idea, but we just bought by the English company"
43:21;43:26;"Allied Lions, I call my boss Tony Hales and London that we're gonna do anything"
43:26;43:31;"I just bought you for you know, three hundred twenty million dollars"
43:31;43:35;"I bought mr. Donor for another 30 million. We gave it to the convert your mind changing the name"
43:35;43:38;"So we basically took a pass on it for a while"
43:38;43:45;"But but we had even toyed with that same idea right in the 90s as we began to realize what we were and what we"
43:45;43:47;"Were gonna become so there's not a single"
43:47;43:51;"Store anywhere that says Dunkin Donuts anymore"
43:51;43:56;"I'm guessing there's still a lot of them that slowly but surely remodeling stuff"
43:56;44:00;"So all the old science still exists and a lot of stores"
44:00;44:04;"But slowly but surely it takes like five or six years to make the conversion"
44:04;44:09;"By the time they have to remodel the normal remodel cycle for the business is probably about seven"
44:10;44:17;"Okay, so if anybody out there sees a sign somewhere that says Dunkin Donuts go take a picture because it's not long"
44:17;44:21;"For this earth actually they were these old neon signs when I was the CEO"
44:21;44:26;"I used to buy them up occasionally when it became available because I realized that part of Americana"
44:26;44:30;"I don't know what the company ever gave him, but I had about three or four of them in storage"
44:30;44:32;"He big old beautiful neon signs"
44:32;44:35;"And it said Dunkin Donuts America's finest coffee"
44:36;44:41;"Yeah, I mean you've had a lot of great branding over the years and it'd be interesting to hear a little bit about the era"
44:41;44:47;"You're just talking about Fred the Baker. So in the 80s that was kind of this total rebrand"
44:47;44:49;"17 year campaign"
44:49;44:55;"17 year campaign very successful and that was around the same time that you you brought in an agency to"
44:55;44:59;"Give you guys the new Frankfurter font, which you still use today"
44:59;45:00;"Yeah"
45:00;45:06;"And they pulled out the orange and the pink colors which are still part of the kind of brand identity today"
45:06;45:12;"So orange and raspberry orange and raspberry. That's what I called it. Oh, yeah, it is more it is more of a raspberry"
45:12;45:13;"Yeah, that makes sense"
45:13;45:18;"But so the 80s was kind of the birth in some ways of like the modern Duncan as we know"
45:18;45:23;"Obviously as as the CEO, you know that advertising is incredibly important"
45:23;45:28;"You were saying how important the brand is and building the brand and making people familiar with it"
45:28;45:36;"Just kind of like walk us through how that worked. You would go to a some like hotshot young"
45:36;45:42;"Executives and they would come pitch you mad men style just like introducing Fred the Baker"
45:42;45:44;"You watch it on a big thing and you so okay"
45:44;45:50;"So the first time these guys come and show you Fred the Baker were you immediately sold did you have questions?"
45:50;45:52;"No, I just actually I"
45:53;46:00;"It was Carl Alley and Ali Ali and I found and Carl Alley was sort of a Jimmy Breslin kind of character"
46:00;46:01;"New York is bigger than life"
46:01;46:07;"Cigars, you know chomping guy and and maybe a copyright. I had no idea what he did"
46:07;46:12;"But very creative and and basically I was unhappy with the agency in Boston"
46:12;46:18;"We made this great commercial with kids singing and donuts and someone made a one-off commercial"
46:18;46:22;"with Fred the Baker or Mike Michael Vail"
46:22;46:28;"From and when I was I had a winter home occasionally we would use at Christmas time in Florida"
46:28;46:32;"I was coming back on a weekend and I hear some guy in the aisle"
46:32;46:37;"Talking to a friend saying I've got to go back to work. It's time to make the donuts"
46:37;46:40;"That was a one-off commercial"
46:40;46:44;"That it just on someone's idea. It wasn't mine"
46:44;46:48;"I have no idea where it came from and basically came back to the others"
46:48;46:54;"I think we're on to something in terms of how people to find hard work and and it resonates with"
46:54;47:00;"Consumers and then we made that our campaign and we put away the one we've spent all this fortune"
47:00;47:06;"I actually went to the shoots all over when we made this commercial with the kids and the music we had Gavin and Joe Raposo"
47:06;47:09;"Random the Muffet's campaign"
47:09;47:15;"Sesame Street music a week. I mean we were off on a totally different to and"
47:16;47:22;"Indifferently this was made and it looked like we struck a note and we basically rode with it for the next 17 years"
47:22;47:27;"So you can the expensive commercial and then you triple down on the cheap one?"
47:27;47:32;"Because you could just see that that phrase was resonating. It was a hunch that"
47:32;47:36;"Resonated with people in terms of what it took and then"
47:36;47:40;"Since Helmstein who was the head of marketing a brilliant guy"
47:40;47:44;"Basically felt strongly that our competition really was in those days"
47:44;47:50;"We saw it as supermarkets and donuts as opposed to beverages and it was a commercial as I bet you the guys in"
47:50;47:57;"Supermarkets don't go through all this trouble to make their doughnuts this way and and you be in a revolving door"
47:57;48:02;"Predicaments he'd get himself into I"
48:02;48:06;"Occasionally we would work in the stores and I I would I would work like once a year in the store"
48:06;48:11;"And it was on an anniversary day that he was working with me the lines the judges autograph on a picture"
48:11;48:18;"Out the door if people waiting for a half hour to get Michael Vail signature on he was very popular"
48:18;48:20;"people loved him and"
48:20;48:23;"He told us the brand story wonderfully well"
48:23;48:31;"Until we changed the beverages and then unfortunately had to retire right now, but that's when you gave him a parade in Boston"
48:32;48:40;"And Larry Bird did a commercial. I mean he was basically giving Frank and hints on the skill or what it took in order to retire"
48:40;48:44;"Gracefully right and that's a good idea. It wasn't the happiest kind of world"
48:44;48:52;"When he when he did have to retire question for you in that same era the actor Michael Vail who did Fred the Baker?"
48:52;48:57;"He was also playing Sam Breakstone for the Breakstone cream cheese"
48:58;49:03;"Did that bother you? Well, he stopped that. I mean he basically was he was on contract for us"
49:03;49:10;"He had to do a nice server a number of personal appearances and I may I think Breakstone gave it up"
49:10;49:11;"I never really"
49:11;49:13;"Never it never came to an issue"
49:13;49:17;"Because I don't think breaks don't use them but he was terrific when the little dog was biting his leg"
49:17;49:19;"He was like a turn-of-the-century"
49:19;49:24;"Dairy guy that was bringing product and that's that's how he actually was in a movie to me"
49:24;49:30;"His favorite story is when he was a marathon man. He had a small part. I think is the jeweler and how large it really a"
49:30;49:35;"He's in marathon man was very nice to him. I think so"
49:35;49:41;"Did anybody anybody in that era come pitch you guys on going to Hollywood and making a Fred the Baker movie?"
49:41;49:44;"No"
49:44;49:47;"All right, we'll get we'll get started on that one"
49:47;50:16;"I made my movie first. Yeah. Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed. I'll make a cup of coffee for your head. I'll get you up and going out of bed. And I promise that one day I'll feel fine."
50:17;50:43;"And I promise that one day I'll feel alright. And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar how you like it. And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar how you like it. How you like it."
50:43;50:59;"I guess the one last question I have for you. It's kind of a vibey question, but I was very interested in the book that you talk about a major light bulb moment for you was reading a book that made you really rethink your approach to running the Duncan business."
50:59;51:28;"And this book had nothing to do with donuts coffee or even business. This is the book the best and brightest by David Halberstam, which was a deeply critical book about the US approach in Vietnam taking down a lot of kind of beloved Kennedy and Johnson administration figures who kind of ran the war and kind of like, you know, in some ways a controversial book saying a lot of these educated guys who supposedly are so bright and they knew how to protect American people."
51:28;51:52;"Protect American interests ran a kind of messed up war that was unwinnable and they wouldn't admit it. So it's interesting to me that a book like that was like a major kind of turning point for you and how you saw the way you ran the business. So I'm kind of curious about that. Like, what was your big takeaway from thinking about the best and the brightest in the Vietnam War and how you approached Duncan?"
51:52;52:10;"I guess to go back and sort of set the stage in the first five years, as I told you, I came out of school and through the confluence of the school and good luck happened on the right strategy and then lost it all and basically began to diversify the business at the wrong mission."
52:10;52:27;"I got seduced by Wall Street and 50 times multiple earnings and wanted to keep that up. And really, you can't put an old head on a young body, unfortunately. And my past success was an impediment to my future success."
52:27;52:43;"And in today's world, it's called emotional intelligence. And quite truthfully, at 25, I really wasn't fully baked and probably still not fully baked. But I wasn't aware of what I didn't know. And I began to shoot from the hip and began to believe my own press."
52:43;53:01;"And as a bunda cannon, you could do no wrong. And as a result, I got actually lost. And as a leader, you're taking really literally hundreds of people behind you who are following you, who have faith and confidence in what you're doing. And basically, I was wrong."
53:01;53:13;"And after a few years of doing that, and it started to falter and I started to diversify and build a portfolio franchise business as opposed to focusing on what I did and had a lot of problems."
53:13;53:26;"I was sitting in my living room reading The Best and The Brightest and Hal Bestand was talking about the problem with the Kennedy and Johnson's administration. It was really manned by the best and the brightest, the Ivy Leaguers, the elitists of their day."
53:26;53:48;"People like myself who had gone to Ivy schools, and they basically mismanaged the war, didn't take advantage, didn't go into the hamlets and into the townships where the war was being waged to talk to the people on the front lines, the mayors and the counselors who were running the day to day business and where the Viet Cong were coming from."
53:48;53:59;"They weren't getting that data they were relying on. And as I sat in that chair, I said, ""Oh my God, Hal Bestand could be just about as well talking about me as well."""
53:59;54:11;"So it was a moment of transformation for me personally to learn some degree of humility, to realize the wisdom of my team, of the franchise owners, the people on the left who needed the sale."
54:11;54:25;"We started to go out, all of us, to visit 100 stores a year. We began to start to take people in, create an advisory council, set up our board in a way to put in guide rails so that I wouldn't, as CEO, go off and shoot from the hip as I had before."
54:25;54:44;"We really changed the way we went to market. We changed the way we listened. We became much more open to the people around us. And it was the beginning of a change in me personally, which is really where all businesses and all families, governments, whatever it is, they start from the top."
54:44;55:01;"That's the massive shadow, whether you realize a lot of people watch every motion, every movement, and have tremendous influence over what falls behind. If you're wrongheaded, if you're arrogant, and if you get it wrong, you can create an immense amount of damage in a public way today."
55:01;55:22;"What can happen? That was the beginning of me sort of coming to grips with who I am, what my responsibilities were, and the strength of the team that I had around me, and the strength of the franchisees that created munchkins, opened the door to changing the way we go to market because of the way the Philippine franchise owners, the wives of the owners, had changed the business dramatically."
55:22;55:37;"They changed everything about it, and that opened the door for us as a team, me in particular, to listen, to take advantage of the wisdom of the overall team, and the capabilities of the overall organization. So it was the beginning of me sort of growing up."
55:37;55:48;"Your version of kind of like what going to the front lines and even understanding what's happening was, yeah, going to stores more often, talking to the franchisees, realizing that it could be..."
55:48;55:55;"Going to a hundred stores, I would ask them questions, wasn't there to inspect the store, I was there to listen, basically."
55:55;56:11;"I really respect that moment of self-reflection, because I, yeah, in a sense, I feel like all good ideas tend to come from the bottom up. Top-down stuff never works, especially if it's rooted in kind of like credentialism, because somebody went to a certain school."
56:11;56:25;"I went to an Ivy League school too, and the way I always think about it, I met some very smart people there, but I also met the biggest morons I ever met in my life. So the idea that that alone qualifies anybody for anything is totally insane."
56:25;56:35;"It's easy to believe your own press once you get in. You think they've already credentialed you for life, and it's not true. It's arrogance, and that's really what he was saying."
56:35;56:45;"Alberstadt was suffering. What they suffered from, the Kennedy-Johnson administration, with George Bundy and Robert McNamara, they suffered from hubris, arrogance, the Greek word for arrogance."
56:45;56:49;"And that was me. Same thing. Because you go through the same exact thing."
56:49;56:57;"And it's very hard for a lot of people to have those kind of moments of self-reflection and kind of, yeah, rethink, believing your own bullsh*t, buying your own press."
56:57;56:58;"You bet it."
56:58;57:06;"Let's wrap it up with just a few fun questions. I love hearing all this stuff. I'm just kind of curious. Well, Seinfeld, what was your original question?"
57:06;57:22;"Yeah, hey, Seinfeld2000 here, not my birth name. I just had a question earlier about these new product rollouts and whether the CEO of a company, when a new product is being tested by a Dunkin',"
57:22;57:39;"for example, the avocado toast or some sort of newfangled donut, does the CEO get in there and taste test? Do you need to try it? Or do you trust your marketing people and your staff to sort of bet on something they think is going to work?"
57:39;57:46;"Great question. I actually was born with a malformation on my tongue, so my taste buds aren't the most acute."
57:46;57:56;"So early on, we had to go to the office and we brought in a food technologist and they qualified 25 people in the office whose taste buds were actually exquisite."
57:56;58:03;"And I relied upon them to tell me whether or not we really were better than the competitive product that existed in the marketplace."
58:03;58:07;"They would have tastings all the time. The governor of Merch used to set it up for us."
58:07;58:19;"So I myself didn't trust myself. I mean, I had strong opinions about the Jordan Marsh muffin. We went into the muffin business. I had a big thing about fruit to crumb ratios."
58:19;58:28;"I mean, I could get very obsessive about that stuff. But my taste buds weren't the best. So I relied upon a team of people to help do that."
58:28;58:33;"Before I went out the door, and I suspect it's the same way today, it really has to meet a standard."
58:33;58:39;"And they really have to have a very rigorous way of evaluating it against what else is available in the marketplace."
58:39;58:46;"Because fundamentally, business is very simple. You basically have to provide a bit of good or service that's better than what else exists in the marketplace."
58:46;58:49;"Otherwise, you shouldn't bother. And it won't survive."
58:49;58:53;"Wow, Bob, I don't know. I can't remember if you talk about the taste buds thing in the book."
58:53;58:54;"No, I didn't."
58:54;58:59;"Okay, so this might be a Time Crisis exclusive. That's a real bombshell."
58:59;59:05;"Well, when you say your taste buds aren't the best, you just feel like you're at a slight disadvantage."
59:05;59:10;"I mean, like, you could taste the difference between a chocolate donut versus a..."
59:10;59:16;"Yeah, it's, yeah, it's, yeah. But it wasn't as discriminating as the saying."
59:16;59:22;"My mother had it. It's a congenital thing. Basically, some people have vascular malformations in different places."
59:22;59:27;"I realized that and that wasn't my strength, but that wasn't what they were paying me for."
59:27;59:37;"Basically, my job was the plan or to lead an organization to effective strategies and changes and keep adapting to an ever-changing marketplace."
59:37;59:44;"So we had to build in systems that would help me and help the company accomplish that."
59:44;59:48;"And I wasn't the last one. That wasn't what I was being paid to do."
59:48;59:49;"Right."
59:49;59:53;"I had lots of weaknesses. I wasn't the best at most things."
59:53;01:00:01;"Basically, what I was good at was that I had great people, a lucky guy, a great team of people who complimented me."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"And I loved them and listened to them for the most part."
01:00:04;01:00:08;"As together as a team, we were a lot stronger than certainly I was as an individual."
01:00:08;01:00:14;"I don't believe sort of in the leader and the white horse that comes in is the difference between success and failure."
01:00:14;01:00:18;"I really don't believe that's the model for success for a business."
01:00:18;01:00:24;"I really do believe it's a team sport and you're only as good as the team and the team should be complimentary."
01:00:24;01:00:28;"In other words, each person, you know, you won't find everybody good at everything."
01:00:28;01:00:36;"You really should build on your strengths and don't try to remediate their weaknesses and remediate by virtue of having people on the team that can remediate."
01:00:36;01:00:43;"Have mutual respect, a great value system where people know backbiting, where they love one another and take care of one another."
01:00:43;01:00:49;"And no one's really trying to climb over somebody else's back. Doesn't fit in our culture. That wasn't our culture."
01:00:49;01:00:54;"Our culture, very teaming. The success of that business was the team, not me."
01:00:54;01:01:02;"That's a cool way to put it. And I definitely liked in the book, you had a lot of generosity and making sure you always shouted out the people who worked with you,"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"people you hired in different positions at Duncan."
01:01:04;01:01:09;"And you talk about how it was really important to you to know that people were compensated fairly."
01:01:09;01:01:17;"And obviously you give so much credit to the franchisees, the people on the ground, opening the businesses."
01:01:17;01:01:22;"And like you said, I guess just one last question is this couple in Connecticut, they invent the munchkin."
01:01:22;01:01:27;"You take that worldwide huge hit. Does that get weird?"
01:01:27;01:01:32;"Are they asking for a royalty or it's just an all ships rise kind of thing? How does that work?"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"All ships rise. Well, we always sold donut holes."
01:01:35;01:01:41;"It was Edna who developed a different cutter and she started piling them high and made them out of both cake and yeast and fill them."
01:01:41;01:01:46;"She was basically taking an old idea we had had even when I was a kid and I worked in the stores."
01:01:46;01:01:52;"We used to at Halloween, we put these little donut holes, which at the center cuts out of the cake donut product."
01:01:52;01:02:00;"We have cake donut, yeast donut, and we put them in a cellophane bag like a potato chip holder clip just at Halloween because we thought it was a good trick or treat item."
01:02:00;01:02:05;"And she was the one who came along and saw an opportunity to do something different and she created it."
01:02:05;01:02:10;"And her husband, Bob Demme, was a guy who actually taught me how to make donuts when I was a kid."
01:02:10;01:02:13;"We both worked in the Natick store in Natick, Massachusetts."
01:02:13;01:02:17;"And he called me and asked me to come down and we did."
01:02:17;01:02:22;"Bob Kamerich and Tom Schwartz, the CEO of the company, had a marketing, the three of us got in the car."
01:02:22;01:02:27;"The next day we went down. Sure enough, there they were. Business was up 20 percent."
01:02:27;01:02:32;"We knew we had a phenomenal winner. Again, the wisdom of the last three to the sale."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"I had the Demmeris creation."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"Shout out to the Demmeris. And I guess our final question is because Seinfeld is Canadian."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"What do you have to say about Tim Hortons?"
01:02:40;01:02:45;"Love it. Love them. Rod Joyce was a close friend of mine."
01:02:45;01:02:51;"He used to tempt me constantly about buying the business because he always wanted to check what his net worth was."
01:02:51;01:03:00;"But he was a great guy, a good friend. And Tim's was unbeatable in Canada, particularly in the Maritimes."
01:03:00;01:03:08;"And we had opened in Quebec and ultimately they put us out there as we probably precluded them in many of the markets in the US."
01:03:08;01:03:14;"But what it did, you know, basically he was my toughest competitor and a close competitor."
01:03:14;01:03:19;"I actually gave when they opened up the Tim camp and the Maritimes."
01:03:19;01:03:24;"I actually went to Tatamaguchi. I had gone to give him a speech to their franchise."
01:03:24;01:03:28;"He invited me to give a talk to their franchisees at their annual convention."
01:03:28;01:03:31;"I was the keynote speaker. So we were close friends."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"So you had a healthy rivalry."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"I was with all my competitors, actually."
01:03:35;01:03:41;"Right. And I guess ultimately you guys had these kind of unbeatable strongholds like New England."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"They had parts of Canada."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"Fortress."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"Yeah, you had your fortress."
01:03:46;01:03:50;"So your relationship is probably, yeah, it's like the US and Canada."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"It's the donut version of the American Canadian relationship."
01:03:53;01:03:57;"And he did a great job. He did a phenomenal job."
01:03:57;01:04:00;"Well, thanks so much, Bob. It's been great hearing your story."
01:04:00;01:04:04;"Recommend your book to anybody who's not only interested in Dunkin Donuts."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"Just tell them what the name of the book is. You haven't mentioned the name of the book."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Oh, I did before you on, but I'll say it again."
01:04:09;01:04:14;"Around the Corner to Around the World, A Dozen Lessons I Learned Running Dunkin Donuts."
01:04:14;01:04:21;"Check it out. It's got that beautiful raspberry and orange color palette and the Frankfurter font."
01:04:21;01:04:22;"Yeah."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"Yeah, well, I hope you'll come back sometime. I'm sure we'll have some more questions for you in the future."
01:04:26;01:04:30;"I'd love to. Thank you very much for your interest, but thank you for your questions. I really had fun."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"Yeah, great talking to you."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"It was interesting and great."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"All right, well, thanks, Bob."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"Nice talking to you, too."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"Appreciate it. Have a good one."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"You're welcome. Thank you. Bye-bye."
01:04:39;01:04:47;"I was raised in a place that's become a disgrace."
01:04:47;01:04:55;"Everything that I once knew, now there is no trace."
01:04:55;01:05:03;"The pumpkin patch, the fall harvest, has been paved with a new target."
01:05:03;01:05:19;"They call it progress, but for who? They tell us all, but it's only a few."
01:05:19;01:05:27;"They tore the old buildings down, replaced them all in beige and brown."
01:05:27;01:05:41;"What do I see when I drive around? It's all the same from town to town."
01:05:41;01:05:44;"From town to town."
01:05:44;01:05:49;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
01:05:49;01:05:54;"Great question, Seinfeld. Bob Rosenberg, real nice guy."
01:05:54;01:06:00;"I've been asking, but there's been a part of me that always wanted to be a Dunkin' Donuts franchisee."
01:06:00;01:06:04;"Way before I read this book, I always liked the idea of just, I have no idea how much it costs."
01:06:04;01:06:10;"It's possible I couldn't afford it, but I always, you know, you hear about people working one business"
01:06:10;01:06:18;"and then they start investing, you know, like Rick Ross owns like 30 Wingstops."
01:06:18;01:06:23;"So, you know, I always liked the idea of having like, owning a couple of Dunkins in New Jersey."
01:06:23;01:06:28;"I imagine all the best locations are kind of taken. I'd have to do some research."
01:06:28;01:06:32;"I wonder if that's a good business to get into now. I wonder what the outlook is for Dunkin'."
01:06:32;01:06:36;"So, the initial franchise fee is $40,000."
01:06:36;01:06:40;"That goes straight to Dunkin' to inspire."
01:06:40;01:06:48;"So it looks like basically the total investment is somewhere between $97,000 and $1.1 million."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"That's a huge difference. That's a huge range."
01:06:51;01:07:00;"Yeah, I'm wondering what, I mean, I'll dig deeper, but it's sort of, I assume that has to do with location, right?"
01:07:00;01:07:07;"Like if you want to open up a franchise in Manhattan, it's not going to be the same as opening it up out in Jersey."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"Maybe the way to really rake it in, keep our early investment low, but have real high upside,"
01:07:11;01:07:14;"we have to create kind of a destination Dunkin'."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Can I make a suggestion?"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Yeah."
01:07:17;01:07:24;"Let's open up the closest Dunkin' to Ben Affleck's house, so that he only has to like walk a block away,"
01:07:24;01:07:29;"but then everybody in the town becomes aware that this is Ben Affleck's Dunkin'."
01:07:29;01:07:34;"He becomes the unwitting sponsor of that one location. Just putting it out there."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Just for the marketing."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"That's a great idea."
01:07:37;01:07:40;"It's sort of like, you know how Prada made that store out in the desert?"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Out in Marfa?"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"Yeah."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"Yeah, that will be our Affleck Dunkin'."
01:07:45;01:07:53;"Right, okay. In this version, it's actually nowhere near his house, but we use him for the branding."
01:07:53;01:08:00;"That'd be funny. We find some abandoned old storefront somewhere in the middle,"
01:08:00;01:08:04;"like just deep, basically an abandoned desert town."
01:08:04;01:08:08;"Or maybe we do it in Centralia, Pennsylvania. Like an abandoned town."
01:08:08;01:08:13;"They actually pay us to take it, and we build the Dunkin', and then our whole thing is,"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"""Mr. Affleck, we know we're nowhere near any of your homes."
01:08:16;01:08:20;"However, we would like to offer you free Dunkin' for life."""
01:08:20;01:08:22;"[Laughter]"
01:08:22;01:08:26;"And we make a big PR statement about it, and we're just like,"
01:08:26;01:08:31;"""Sir, it might take us a while, but we will be happy to send one of our employees"
01:08:31;01:08:36;"to your home in Santa Monica, California. You just gotta give us about two days,"
01:08:36;01:08:40;"but we will deliver."" Basically, our whole thing is like, we got a lot of heart."
01:08:40;01:08:45;"And then maybe for years, we make this whole thing, ""Will he finally come to the location?"""
01:08:45;01:08:49;"There's a picture I always see on Instagram and stuff that's like,"
01:08:49;01:08:56;"""The loneliest house on earth."" It's like this giant island off of Iceland,"
01:08:56;01:09:01;"and there's just one little house on it. And it's the most isolated house on earth or something."
01:09:01;01:09:04;"And it'd be kind of cool to do a Dunkin' there."
01:09:04;01:09:13;"Also, maybe we could get a museum involved or something, because people do site-specific art"
01:09:13;01:09:19;"where probably they spend tens of millions of dollars getting donations and grants from people."
01:09:19;01:09:27;"If we could do a Dunkin' for $97,000, and we just make it on an abandoned oil rig somewhere,"
01:09:27;01:09:31;"I think that could be some Christo sh*t. People start sailing boats there."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"I think we could really have the interplay of art and commerce here."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"Yeah, it sounds like the perfect combination of art and commerce for sure."
01:09:38;01:09:44;"I like the idea that it's on this abandoned oil rig, and it's one tagline, claim to fame is,"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"""This is where Ben Affleck eats for free."""
01:09:47;01:09:49;"Right."
01:09:49;01:09:53;"He's never eaten there, but he shows up, he eats for free."
01:09:53;01:09:57;"Actually, as we say, this is such a Nathan for you idea."
01:09:57;01:10:02;"The plan, start the world's cheapest Dunkin' Donuts in the middle of nowhere,"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"but Ben Affleck eats there for free."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"Guys, Affleck runs on Dunkin'."
01:10:08;01:10:14;"Make that the tagline, just for that one franchise, just for that one restaurant."
01:10:14;01:10:17;"I wonder if he owns any Dunkins, quietly."
01:10:17;01:10:20;"That'd make a lot of sense, because he always..."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"I mean, I don't know where he lives, I don't want to know where he lives,"
01:10:23;01:10:28;"but I have, unfortunately, I feel bad for the guy, always getting his picture taken,"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"looking like he doesn't want that to happen."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"But when you see these unfortunate pictures,"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"he's always holding a bunch of stuff at the front door,"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"and there's just a part of me that's like,"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"""Dude, where the f*** do you live, Ben Affleck?"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"You can't get a gate? I mean, maybe good for him."""
01:10:44;01:10:46;"He does seem a little exposed."
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I guess he's a man of the people, but I'm just like,"
01:10:48;01:10:51;"""You're this incredibly famous dude, the paparazzi won't leave you alone."""
01:10:51;01:10:53;"You can't find a way to get your Dunkin'"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"without just being there in your bathrobe,"
01:10:55;01:10:59;"staring face-to-face with this photographer, just like, ""Ugh!"""
01:10:59;01:11:02;"As I recall, you can see the number of his house, I believe,"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"on the door in those photos, too."
01:11:04;01:11:07;"Unless I'm making that up in my head, but I seem to recall..."
01:11:07;01:11:11;"I'm like, ""How can they publish his home address in any form?"""
01:11:11;01:11:13;"I might be wrong, let me look it up."
01:11:13;01:11:14;"""Leave Ben alone."""
01:11:14;01:11:18;"I feel like somebody on the thread, maybe it was Jake, was saying that it was all..."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"Or maybe it was you, Nick, that could it all be viral marketing"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"for Dunkin' Donuts, using paparazzi to get it out there?"
01:11:24;01:11:27;"And maybe, it wouldn't shock me if quietly you found out,"
01:11:27;01:11:33;"""Oh, Ben Affleck's a silent partner in a firm that owns 70 Dunkins."""
01:11:33;01:11:35;"-Why not? -I'm seeing a partial..."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"There's a partial address, partial number here."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Well, I mean, the thing that really..."
01:11:39;01:11:42;"It's everything you're saying, coupled with the fact"
01:11:42;01:11:47;"that he just cannot seem to be able to carry the Dunkin' Donuts."
01:11:47;01:11:49;"I mean, he's constantly dropping them."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"-I mean, it's just... -He's got mail, too."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"He's got Amazon packages and stuff."
01:11:54;01:11:57;"He needs to make more than one trip,"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"but maybe the paparazzi that are out there,"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"he wants to just make it efficient, get in, get out."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"No, it's sort of a..."
01:12:05;01:12:08;"Yeah, it's a perfect storm, I think is what's happening."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"And yeah, if he just got a gate..."
01:12:10;01:12:14;"Or, like, I mean, there's no way he doesn't have an assistant or something."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"He can't just give them a key to the house,"
01:12:16;01:12:19;"just be like, ""Hey, leave the Dunkin' on the counter."""
01:12:19;01:12:21;"I'm not trying to shame him at all."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"He should live however he wants,"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"but I guess what strikes me as strange"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"is that he lives in this funny middle zone where he's..."
01:12:28;01:12:32;"You know, there's celebrities who are either just so..."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"They get zen about paparazzi,"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"and they'll just be like, ""Hey, guys."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Yep, I'm walking to Dunkin'."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"All right. How you doing?"""
01:12:40;01:12:42;"You know, and they just kind of go to Dunkin',"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"sit down like, ""This is my life. All right."""
01:12:44;01:12:47;"And they don't fight it, and they just go about their day to day."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"But it's like, when I see those pictures,"
01:12:49;01:12:52;"I get the sense that the Dunkin' was delivered."
01:12:52;01:12:55;"He came out, looked at all the cameras, grabbed it,"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"and was like, ""Ugh!"""
01:12:56;01:12:59;"I'm just kind of like, ""There's got to be a way to avoid this."""
01:12:59;01:13:01;"Or maybe Dunkin's paying him."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"Which would make our franchise a lot easier to sell"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"if there's already a collaboration happening."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"Yeah, I mean, there's a decent amount in California."
01:13:09;01:13:10;"I wonder how..."
01:13:10;01:13:13;"What the prospects for Dunkin' growth in California are"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"because it's..."
01:13:15;01:13:18;"California still has a lot of smaller competitors,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"like the Yum Donuts,"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"and there's more of these..."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"Not the kind of bougie, hipster, independent ones,"
01:13:25;01:13:27;"but, you know, like old school."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Yeah, like old school."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"There's a lot that were started by Chinese immigrants."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"There's some that have all sorts of other food."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"LA's got its own funky donut culture."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"Anyway, Robert Rosenberg, what a guy."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"When I really picture being CEO..."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"I'm not sure if I'm CEO of any companies."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"I'm definitely president of some random vampire weekend..."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Vampire weekend industries?"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Yeah, I'm president of a couple,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"some shell corporations,"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"but obviously there's some similarities"
01:13:58;01:14:01;"between running a business and just being in a band"
01:14:01;01:14:05;"and just trying to surf the waves of fortune."
01:14:05;01:14:07;"Things are changing."
01:14:07;01:14:10;"I think with music, it's not quite as intense as,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"as he described, they have their New England fortress,"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"and it really is like battle"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"because there's only so many donuts to sell per city."
01:14:18;01:14:20;"And it's like, Tim Hortons,"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"you think you're going to open more than a handful"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"in Quincy, Massachusetts?"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"I dare you to try. Go f*** yourself, Tim."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"This is Duncan country."
01:14:28;01:14:30;"But then on the flip side, Duncan's kind of like"
01:14:30;01:14:33;"dipping their toes into a new country or a new state,"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"and they get pushed back a little bit"
01:14:35;01:14:38;"because I don't know if there's quite the equivalent with music"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"but theoretically, you know,"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"people get really excited about music."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"I've always thought of it as an all ships rise thing."
01:14:44;01:14:48;"Like people getting psyched on music or bands or something."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"It's not like Timmy's versus Duncan,"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"but still, you know, you have to surf the waves of fortune"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"and there's trends and knowing your lane"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"and all that kind of stuff."
01:14:58;01:15:01;"But I wonder if, I mean, clearly he lives for it."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"He understands his role as CEO."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"He's not the taste buds guy."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"His job is to like, is essentially that,"
01:15:07;01:15:10;"is to help Duncan go from era to era."
01:15:10;01:15:15;"But when you think about 1963 to the early 2000s,"
01:15:15;01:15:17;"he just watched so much s*** change."
01:15:17;01:15:21;"I can't believe how desolate the coffee world was in the early 60s."
01:15:21;01:15:26;"And then by the late 90s, you got 90s coffee culture, Starbucks."
01:15:26;01:15:29;"It's like two different worlds."
01:15:29;01:15:32;"That's like generations past from when he took the reins"
01:15:32;01:15:34;"to when he retired."
01:15:34;01:15:39;"And I wonder if for other people, that is like fun."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"Seems like stressful to me."
01:15:41;01:15:44;"You're dealing with donut flavors and hostile takeovers."
01:15:44;01:15:47;"You're dealing with constant competitors."
01:15:47;01:15:49;"You're dealing with franchises."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"You're dealing with Starbucks."
01:15:51;01:15:54;"You're dealing with changing taste of the American consumer."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"It's a lot."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"But some people live for it, I guess."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"Some people love that."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"And he doesn't seem too sentimental about it."

01:16:05;01:16:10;"I wondered if asking him questions about when he finally defeated Mr. Donut,"
01:16:10;01:16:13;"the McCoys to his family's Hatfield, was that emotional?"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"And he's kind of like, ""Eh, not really."""
01:16:15;01:16:17;"You know, it was a long process."
01:16:17;01:16:20;"And he was more excited, as he should be, I suppose,"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"to talk about what he learned about the power of brands"
01:16:23;01:16:27;"when he rebranded all those Mr. Donuts as Duncan."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"I thought maybe he might have kind of like one of those speeches"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"you read about from antiquity where he'd say,"
01:16:33;01:16:35;"""You know, when I watched the--"
01:16:35;01:16:39;"when I knew that we had finally defeated Mr. Donut in America"

01:16:44;01:16:46;"of course I felt happy."
01:16:46;01:16:51;"I was achieving my father's dream of raising Duncan to prominence."
01:16:51;01:16:57;"But I also wept a tear for all that time that had passed,"
01:16:57;01:17:02;"all the Donuts that had been sold and the lives that had been lived"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"in these locations."""
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Maybe you don't have time to be too much like that"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"in the fast-paced world of business."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"I was going to say the one thing that sort of really stuck out to me"
01:17:11;01:17:16;"was obviously a huge part of his success is knowing his limitations, right?"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"And I'm sure that's a huge part of the book."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"It's not what you know, it's sort of what you don't know about yourself."
01:17:21;01:17:24;"And that's obviously really important and really hard to know."
01:17:24;01:17:29;"But all the things to know that you have an inadequate palate,"
01:17:29;01:17:30;"like that your taste--"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"I just feel it's almost embarrassing."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"It's almost something that I can't even imagine most people"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"knowing about themselves as much as people in the food industry"
01:17:37;01:17:39;"to go, ""Hey, let me tell you."
01:17:39;01:17:44;"I know I kind of-- I can't-- I don't have a really good taste in food."""
01:17:44;01:17:46;"It's just such a hard thing to admit."
01:17:46;01:17:50;"That raised such a question for me too because he used the phrase--"
01:17:50;01:17:55;"didn't he say something like, ""We had the most exquisite tasters"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"or we had people with the most exquisite taste buds,"""
01:17:57;01:18:00;"and I just thought it's so subjective."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"How do you even--"
01:18:01;01:18:05;"No, he said-- and I would have asked him this--"
01:18:05;01:18:08;"he said that they had a professional who--"
01:18:08;01:18:12;"they are the barometer, come in and test everyone in the company."
01:18:12;01:18:14;"And the 20 people that sort of had--"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"and the idea of taste being objective and not subjective"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"is also totally interesting, right?"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"People don't know that about themselves."
01:18:21;01:18:25;"They don't go, ""Well, everyone thinks their taste in everything is the best."""
01:18:25;01:18:26;"That's the whole point, but he's like--"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"So, who is this independent--"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Yes, so they go and they test everybody almost like a 20--"
01:18:31;01:18:33;"like a vision tester, and they said,"
01:18:33;01:18:38;"""These people in your company have objectively the most refined palate"
01:18:38;01:18:41;"and they'll be your test-- testers."""
01:18:41;01:18:43;"It could have been the reception."
01:18:43;01:18:45;"They're testing for accuracy?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"Yeah, maybe it's relative."
01:18:47;01:18:51;"It's kind of like, ""I'm going to give you 10 bites of something."
01:18:51;01:18:54;"At the end, you're going to tell me which bites match."""
01:18:54;01:18:57;"And maybe some people are like, ""Well, one and five, two and six."""
01:18:57;01:19:00;"And other people would be like, ""Uh, I don't know, man."""
01:19:00;01:19:03;"Or the broadest palate, like when you're like,"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"""Tell me about the note that you taste in this."""
01:19:05;01:19:08;"I mean, the whole idea is-- it was wild."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Yeah, I guess you could be a super taster,"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"just like some people are super recognizers."
01:19:13;01:19:15;"You familiar with this concept?"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"You could see a picture of a baby and just be like,"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"""That's Lady Gaga."""
01:19:19;01:19:20;"[laughs]"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Here's a transition."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"Speaking of super recognizers,"
01:19:24;01:19:30;"you think your company mate, bandmate, Chris Baio,"
01:19:30;01:19:35;"who's waiting on the other line as a super recognizer, super taster--"
01:19:35;01:19:37;"he may be a super taster."
01:19:37;01:19:39;"He's the one who loves hot sauce, right?"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Chris has a very good memory,"
01:19:41;01:19:45;"which that's like the one version of that drawing connections a lot."
01:19:45;01:19:48;"He's really good at remembering dates"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"and how many times we played a venue, things like that."
01:19:50;01:19:54;"So it wouldn't shock me if he could apply some of that memory stuff"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"to the other senses."
01:19:56;01:19:58;"All right, let's get Baio on the horn."

01:20:43;01:20:44;"Good to be back."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"We were just talking to Robert Rosenberg,"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"longtime CEO of Dunkin' Donuts."
01:20:49;01:20:53;"I'm curious, do you have warm feelings about Dunkin'?"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"I do, yeah, definitely."
01:20:56;01:20:59;"I think maybe in LaGuardia,"
01:20:59;01:21:02;"the terminal that we would typically fly through,"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"there's a Dunkin' there,"
01:21:04;01:21:07;"and I associate that with coming back to New York."
01:21:07;01:21:10;"I mean, I know it's more like a Massachusetts brand,"
01:21:10;01:21:16;"but also my understanding is that their coffee was fair trade going way back,"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"but they just never advertised it."
01:21:18;01:21:19;"Is that true? Did you get into that?"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"Oh, we didn't talk about that, but they definitely--"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"I think it was-- I don't know, was it fair trade? I don't know."
01:21:25;01:21:27;"But it was definitely cut above."
01:21:27;01:21:30;"It's funny what you said about coming back to New York and seeing it,"
01:21:30;01:21:33;"because I don't think I realized it was a Massachusetts company"
01:21:33;01:21:36;"until I was in my 20s."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"I just always thought--"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"I just kind of thought it was a New York thing."
01:21:40;01:21:45;"I'm sure that's because they work to make everybody feel like"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Dunkin's your local spot,"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"because I don't know if you remember,"
01:21:49;01:21:53;"I think we were texting about it when Eli Manning retired,"
01:21:53;01:21:57;"and in the New York area, he did a lot of commercials for Dunkin."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"And so a lot of people were paying their respects to him,"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"a lot of brands,"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"and I couldn't help but notice that the Dunkin corporate"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"hadn't said a word about it, and I tweeted at them,"
01:22:07;01:22:10;"""Why didn't you wish Eli a happy retirement?"""
01:22:10;01:22:11;"And then I started to realize,"
01:22:11;01:22:15;"""Oh, maybe that's something they don't want to send out to the whole world,"""
01:22:15;01:22:18;"because they want people in Boston to not even know"
01:22:18;01:22:22;"that Eli's doing Dunkin commercials down New York way."
01:22:22;01:22:25;"That's a really good point, and I hadn't thought of it that way."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"Also, I don't know if you remember,"
01:22:26;01:22:29;"but I elevated your tweet with a retweet"
01:22:29;01:22:33;"to try and get the word out a little further out."
01:22:33;01:22:39;"But I understand why you've got to be careful in that situation."
01:22:39;01:22:42;"Actually, I remember when we played in Boston,"
01:22:42;01:22:46;"we did Sister of Pearl, which was really fun."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"In Boston, we played in the college hockey arena."
01:22:49;01:22:53;"And the reason why--I dedicated the song to Dan Quinn,"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"who's the New York Rangers coach,"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"who had previously coached at Boston University,"
01:22:58;01:23:01;"but I didn't say why because I didn't want to inflame"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"those regional sports tensions."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"So I think you're definitely on to something when you say that,"
01:23:06;01:23:10;"yeah, you've got to be careful with how you play your Boston-ness"
01:23:10;01:23:13;"or when you're running a nationwide company."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Yeah, I guess it's the same way."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"These billionaires and big companies,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"they don't want to go put out a whole press release that's like,"
01:23:20;01:23:24;"""Hey, guys, we're really proud to announce that through a series"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"of super PACs we've given $20 million to Donald Trump,"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"but we also gave a similar amount to Joe Biden."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"That's just who we are."""
01:23:31;01:23:35;"It's so pointless to advertise that."
01:23:35;01:23:38;"You just want to quietly play both sides."
01:23:38;01:23:41;"So what's up with Tucci Tuesdays?"
01:23:41;01:23:43;"Seinfeld's filling me in a little bit."
01:23:43;01:23:45;"Yeah, yeah. I mean, I will say--"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Well, first of all, for people who don't know,"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"who is Stanley Tucci?"
01:23:49;01:23:53;"Stanley Tucci is a true Renaissance man,"
01:23:53;01:23:56;"incredible actor, writer, director."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"His first movie that he wrote and directed was Big Night,"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"a great movie in the '90s."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Oh, yeah. Oh, he directed that?"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"He did, and he wrote it."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"And just an incredible actor."
01:24:07;01:24:11;"And now the star of a new CNN show"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"called Stanley Tucci Searching for Italy,"
01:24:14;01:24:18;"which is a travel show of him going to, like, all--"
01:24:18;01:24:20;"He says he's going to go to all 20 regions of Italy"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"and taste the food and meet the people."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"And it was like--"
01:24:24;01:24:27;"This morning, I just had"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"lightly uncanny experience"
01:24:29;01:24:32;"because Seinfeld sent me a Twitter DM"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"asking if I could come on the show today"
01:24:34;01:24:37;"and discuss Stanley Tucci Searching for Italy"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"and Tucci Tuesday."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"You know, that would have been the first thing I saw"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"when I loaded up Twitter."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Then I would have gone to my feed"
01:24:43;01:24:46;"and seen the blockbuster news that after only airing"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"two episodes, Stanley Tucci's Searching for Italy"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"has been picked up for a second season."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"-Whoa. -Wow."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"So that news just dropped."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"But the story of my love of Stanley Tucci"
01:24:56;01:24:59;"and of posting a picture of Tucci Tuesdays--"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Like, just posting a picture of Stanley Tucci"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"and using the hashtag #TucciTuesday"
01:25:03;01:25:06;"goes back a couple years ago."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"And my appreciation for Stanley Tucci,"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"it definitely predates this."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"You know, we're both Italian-Americans."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"We both grew up in Westchester County."
01:25:15;01:25:18;"I love, like, the kind of"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"real New York, like, journeyman actor"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"vibe of his generation."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Like, I definitely put John Turturro"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"-in the same category. -Great actor."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"He lives in London. I lived in London for a while."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"So we have that in common, too."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"How did Tucci end up in London?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"So in Devil--"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"Like, Emily Blunt is in Devil Wears Prada, right?"
01:25:35;01:25:36;"Yeah."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"Which is a great film that Stanley Tucci's in."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"So let's go back, you know,"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"whatever year--2008, 2010, 2012."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"I don't know the exact time."
01:25:44;01:25:47;"But John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are getting married."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"Stanley Tucci's a guest of Emily Blunt."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"He's a widower."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"He's currently single at this wedding"
01:25:54;01:25:57;"and meets Emily Blunt's beautiful sister,"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Felicity Blunt."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"And they start a relationship"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"and then eventually get married."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"So I think that that relationship"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"-is what brought him to London. -Oh."
01:26:05;01:26:08;"So he married his former co-star's sister."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Yeah, exactly."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"And she's in the first episode"
01:26:12;01:26:14;"of Stanley Tucci Searching for Italy."
01:26:14;01:26:17;"So yeah, we have all this stuff in common."
01:26:17;01:26:20;"And then, this is like two years ago,"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"there was a movie called The Children Act"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"with Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"-I don't know--did you catch that? -No."
01:26:27;01:26:28;"It was a very, very good movie,"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"but I just was like--"
01:26:30;01:26:31;"It was on a Tuesday,"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"and I went to the movies,"
01:26:33;01:26:34;"and I was texting with a friend."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"I was like, ""Oh, yeah, I'm about to see"
01:26:35;01:26:36;"The Children Act."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"I'm about to have a Tucci Tuesday."""
01:26:38;01:26:40;"And I just really loved the, like--"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"the way that sounded,"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"those two words sounded together."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"And then when I was watching the movie,"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"I was just kind of like--"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"One thing I was blown away by"
01:26:47;01:26:50;"is just, like, how f---ing jacked Stanley Tucci is."
01:26:50;01:26:52;"Oh, yeah, he got real muscular."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"But here's the thing."
01:26:53;01:26:56;"He's been, like, low-key jacked his entire career."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"There's, like--"
01:26:57;01:27:01;"He was in this 1980s Levi's commercial"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"where he's wearing a tank top."
01:27:03;01:27:04;"He's just, like, so jacked."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"And, like, any other movie--"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"Like, now that I've gone back and, you know,"
01:27:08;01:27:09;"have gone through, like,"
01:27:09;01:27:12;"posting photos of Tucci through the years"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"on Tucci Tuesdays,"
01:27:14;01:27:15;"he just kind of stayed jacked."
01:27:15;01:27:17;"Like, he could have been in a Marvel movie, definitely,"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"without having to, like, change his regimen"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"or anything like that."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"So, I don't know."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"It's just, like--"
01:27:24;01:27:26;"I've been loving the show."
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I watched all the episodes that are out."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Does the show air on Tuesdays?"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"No, it doesn't."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"It airs on Sunday nights."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"So, do you wait until Tuesdays to watch it,"
01:27:35;01:27:38;"or are you willing to break edge early?"
01:27:38;01:27:39;"I watched it on--"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"Well, I watched it on Mondays,"
01:27:41;01:27:43;"so that way I could post a screen cap"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"on a Tuesday from it."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Okay."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"So, I've been watching it on Monday nights."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"But, yeah, it's also just, like--"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"I feel like in early lockdown,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"people got really into kind of"
01:27:53;01:27:55;"marathoning old Bourdain stuff"
01:27:55;01:27:57;"and just re-watching No Reservations."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"And I think in this era where"
01:28:00;01:28:03;"you can't really go anywhere,"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"seeing someone travel around Italy"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"and eat fine Italian cuisine,"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"hang out with a bunch of Italians,"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"it just was really--"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"It's great."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"I mean, the episode that aired on--"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"Just to give you a little flavor,"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"a little slice of what you get"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"when you watch Stanley Tucci"
01:28:17;01:28:18;"searching for Italy."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"The episode that aired on Sunday"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"was the Rome episode."
01:28:22;01:28:25;"And in it, he hangs out with this guy"
01:28:25;01:28:27;"whose name is Don Pasta,"
01:28:27;01:28:31;"who's a hybrid DJ and pasta maker."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"So, what Don Pasta does--"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"And he seems like such a f***ing legend."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I think he's been doing it for decades."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"He makes pasta in a restaurant"
01:28:39;01:28:41;"while spinning vinyl."
01:28:41;01:28:42;"Whoa."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"He's been doing it for--"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Don Pasta, definitely worth checking him out."
01:28:45;01:28:46;"I checked him out a little bit on Instagram."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"I mean, it sounds like a gimmick,"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"but he must be making some seriously good pasta"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"if Tucci's interviewing him."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"I think he's kind of like a local legend in Rome,"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Don Pasta."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"Uh..."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"His pasta did look great."
01:28:58;01:28:59;"I can't deny it."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"That reminds me of a guy I came across"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"back in the day."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"And I feel like once we interacted on Twitter,"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"because I was shouting him out,"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"I was pretending that he was my cousin."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"[laughs]"
01:29:08;01:29:11;"But he's a guy named DJ Chef."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"He's the chef that rocks."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"[laughs]"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"It's kind of funny, the chef that rocks."
01:29:16;01:29:17;"I mean, I guess a DJ rocks."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"I guess in all the pictures,"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"it always looked like he's making like a paella"
01:29:21;01:29:24;"or something over the sea DJs."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"That can't be good."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"But maybe he just does that for the picture."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Yeah, what was that first shot?"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"It was like half oven range,"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"and then the other side was a turntable?"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Yes."
01:29:38;01:29:41;"And it looked like he was kind of scratching and mixing."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"Yeah, it looks like he's got an open flame"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"right next to the turntable."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"So maybe this is a whole thing."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"Is it possible this is like a whole thing"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"we don't know about, is chef DJs?"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"It might be."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"There must be."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"I think that, you know,"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"there's kind of like,"
01:29:56;01:29:59;"people talk about athletes and musicians"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"wanting to be each other,"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"but I think chefs and musicians are probably that same thing."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Chefs and DJs."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"I also got to point out that"
01:30:07;01:30:10;"if you look up DJ Chef, you're going to get two."
01:30:10;01:30:13;"And so there's DJ Chef, also known as Chefal,"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"is a dubstep DJ from South London."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"This is not who I'm talking about."
01:30:17;01:30:19;"I'm not talking about the British one."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"This guy is based in London."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Well, it seems like he's a tri-state guy."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Hell yeah."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Seems like he does a lot of work in Long Island,"
01:30:26;01:30:28;"Jersey and the Hamptons."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Oh, he follows me."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Follow back."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Boom."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Dead hand control"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"You can take my life"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"But you will never take my soul"
01:30:38;01:30:42;"Dead hand control"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"You can take my life"
01:30:44;01:30:47;"But you will never take my soul"
01:30:47;01:30:54;"I've been thinking about the end times"
01:30:54;01:30:58;"About the madmen and their bones"
01:30:59;01:31:02;"You can't stay dead-hard forever"
01:31:02;01:31:07;"But you didn't sing a simple song"
01:31:07;01:31:10;"Dead hand control"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"You can take my life"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"But you will never take my soul"
01:31:15;01:31:19;"Dead hand control"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"You can take my life"
01:31:21;01:31:23;"But you will never take"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Never take my soul"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"Do you want to do the top five with us?"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"Oh yeah, yeah totally."
01:31:31;01:31:33;"It's time for the top five"
01:31:33;01:31:37;"Five on iTunes"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Alright, so today we're going to do the top five"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"from 1963."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Why '63, anybody?"
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Duncan?"
01:31:44;01:31:48;"It's the year that Bob Rosenberg"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"graduated from Harvard Business School"
01:31:50;01:31:53;"and took over as CEO of the family business."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"Wow."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"So this is also, we were talking"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Chris with him about"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"he was kind of just painting a picture for what 1963 was like"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"and you're a notorious Java head"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"so basically it would be your hell on earth."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"He basically makes it sound like"
01:32:08;01:32:12;"the average American could never get good coffee back then."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"There weren't dedicated coffee shops"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"Duncan kind of pioneered that."
01:32:16;01:32:20;"Most people were just drinking terrible instant coffee at home"
01:32:20;01:32:23;"and he said like in the average American city"
01:32:23;01:32:26;"according to him the only place that you could get"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"a really great cup of coffee"
01:32:28;01:32:31;"might be after dinner at a fancy hotel."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"You know what actually I just realized"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"because part of the Duncan story is that"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"they eventually got rid of donuts"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"it's just called Duncan now"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"they killed off Fred the Baker"
01:32:42;01:32:44;"Killed it."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"They had a funeral for him."
01:32:47;01:32:51;"They had an open casket funeral for him in Boston"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"every member of the Celtics attended"
01:32:53;01:32:56;"but part of that story is that"
01:32:56;01:33:00;"maybe back in the day when all you could get was dog s*** coffee in America"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"the idea of having something sweet to Duncan it"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"was like a necessity."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"It was like this disgusting slop."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"So maybe you like"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"morning, day and night"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"if you're going to drink coffee for your fuel"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"you needed a tasty treat to go with it"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"because otherwise it would be hellish to drink."
01:33:19;01:33:21;"So he kept referring to it as brown water."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"I find this interesting"
01:33:23;01:33:25;"to tie it back a little bit into Stanley Tucci's"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"Searching for Italy"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"in the first episode he said that"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"in Naples"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"during the cholera epidemic"
01:33:33;01:33:37;"you couldn't safely cook food in water"
01:33:37;01:33:40;"because it could poison you and kill you."
01:33:40;01:33:43;"So as a result they just fried everything."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"I see some parallels there between that"
01:33:45;01:33:48;"and also out of self preservation for your coffee"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"and eating something super sweet."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Actually I realize now"
01:33:52;01:33:55;"I do have one Dunkin Donuts story"
01:33:55;01:33:57;"I'd kind of like memory hold it a little bit"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"but during a kind of like"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"chaotic family Thanksgiving"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"I was in a car"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"and I pulled up to a Starbucks"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"with my in-laws and stuff in the car"
01:34:08;01:34:13;"and I had already had an iced Dunkin Java that morning"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"and then we went to the Starbucks window and did our order"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"and I said sorry"
01:34:18;01:34:22;"can you like take this garbage off my hands"
01:34:22;01:34:25;"because we were getting all these new Starbucks coffees"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"the woman at the window said I can't take that garbage"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"that's the only garbage I can't take."
01:34:30;01:34:31;"Really?"
01:34:31;01:34:33;"I think it's probably Starbucks company policy"
01:34:33;01:34:35;"not to accept Dunkin Detritus."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"I didn't think it was heading that way"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"I thought that the end of the story"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"was going to be her being like"
01:34:41;01:34:43;"yeah garbage indeed"
01:34:43;01:34:45;"it's a good coffee."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Wow."
01:34:46;01:34:49;"That seems almost in direct"
01:34:49;01:34:51;"conflict with"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Dunkin's approach"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"where you are kind to your competitors"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"you know the spirit of"
01:34:57;01:35:00;"you know like a mutually beneficial kind of competition"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"like I don't see him throwing out a Tim Hortons."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"We found out that Bob Rosenberg"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"he's very close with the Tim Hortons organization"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"they've always had a friendly rivalry"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"he even spoke at their conference once."
01:35:10;01:35:11;"Oh wow."
01:35:11;01:35:13;"Maybe we should ask him more questions about Starbucks"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"next time."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"Let's hear the soundtrack of 1963"
01:35:17;01:35:20;"just an all around terrible time in history"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"bad coffee"
01:35:22;01:35:24;"lot of"
01:35:24;01:35:26;"terrible things happening in America"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"number 5"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"this week in 1963 is"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"The Rooftop Singers with Walk Right In."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"Long intro."
01:35:59;01:36:01;"So Robert Rosenberg"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"is just getting his diploma."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"Yeah."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"He's walking out and this is playing."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"Yeah this would be good for like a fun montage"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"in the Bob Rosenberg biopic."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"Yeah in the Scorsese version"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"it would be like this song is playing"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"I don't know why but there would be some type of"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"like act of violence in the parking lot"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"of like a Quincy Mass"
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Dunkin Donuts."
01:36:23;01:36:25;"He's just like"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"smashing in his uncle's"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"not a good relationship but"
01:36:29;01:36:30;"his uncle started Mr. Donut."
01:36:30;01:36:31;"There could be some sort of"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"Dunkin Donut Mr. Donut violence happening."
01:36:33;01:36:35;"[laughter]"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Well it's interesting in the note"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"yeah this is like a funny period"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"that I've always been kind of curious about"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"this like late 50s early 60s"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"like folk breakthrough."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"It's kind of sweet."
01:36:46;01:36:48;"It's like still before"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"Bob Dylan's huge."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"And it's kind of just this very traditionalist"
01:36:51;01:36:53;"folk revival"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"that is almost seems a little innocent."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"I know it's associated with like beatniks"
01:36:57;01:36:59;"but then you hear some of this music from this era"
01:36:59;01:37:01;"and just seems so sweet."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"It says here that"
01:37:03;01:37:05;"they wanted the song to have a distinctive sound"
01:37:05;01:37:07;"so they played"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"12 string guitar in the song"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"but they had some difficulty acquiring the instrument."
01:37:11;01:37:13;"So I guess back then it was like"
01:37:13;01:37:15;"really hard to find 12 string guitars."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"And anybody who's not"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"a guitar head or a musician"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"like you know 12 string it's kind of just like"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"every note you hit is doubled"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"by two strings so it's kind of like a fuller"
01:37:25;01:37:27;"sound. Kind of gives it"
01:37:27;01:37:29;"a different vibe. I guess back then just dropping a 12"
01:37:29;01:37:31;"string was really exciting to people."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"I got some kinks vibes."
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Proto kinks vibes on that."
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Oh yeah. You're right. It sounds a lot like"
01:37:37;01:37:39;"picture book."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"The number 4 song"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"yeah this is funny. Already seeing these names"

01:37:47;01:37:49;"Early 60s is a very fascinating time"
01:37:49;01:37:51;"because it's like it's before JFK"
01:37:51;01:37:53;"was shot. Or I guess he was shot"
01:37:53;01:37:55;"was he shot in 63?"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"November 63 right? November 63."
01:37:57;01:37:59;"Alright so this is February 63."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"So it's still Camelot"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"still kind of innocent time."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"It's still a little bit like the"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"long 50s."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"From everything I read about this time"
01:38:09;01:38:11;"even though I guess the coffee was dog sh*t"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"people often refer to the early 60s as being"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"incredibly optimistic."
01:38:15;01:38:17;"You know like there's this"
01:38:17;01:38:19;"feeling that you read in like some history"
01:38:19;01:38:21;"books like the early 60s there was this"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"feeling that America just like"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"still on this post war high"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"20 years later the 50s"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"America is the richest country on earth"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"obviously there's some like significant"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"internal problems but there was a type"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"of optimism. Cool young"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"president was going to solve them."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"Hadn't been embroiled in Vietnam yet."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"And so yeah there's a type of like"
01:38:41;01:38:43;"innocence and simplicity in the music."

01:39:25;01:39:27;"really nicely with an act of violence"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"in the Drunken Donuts movie."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"Yeah I think that it should be"

01:39:57;01:39:59;"like a big turn but we have the rights and he"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"goes to the theater and he's 87 years old"

01:40:25;01:40:27;"maybe after like 1964"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"there's a turning point you start to see"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"very familiar names but"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"as we get to number three this"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"almost sounds like made up"

01:41:03;01:41:05;"it's intercut with violence but like"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"someone's gonna be getting married"

01:41:09;01:41:11;"there's another act of violence."

01:41:13;01:41:15;"Just literally"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"yeah I'm picturing like"

01:41:21;01:41:23;"Bob if you're listening"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"obviously these are all flights of fancy"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"but yeah maybe it's like"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"1963 the year I graduated"
01:41:29;01:41:31;"Harvard Business School, got married"
01:41:31;01:41:33;"and became the youngest CEO of a"

01:41:39;01:41:41;"but we have to do like the wedding sequence"

01:41:43;01:41:45;"everybody and his dad and"
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Uncle Harry just like have to be separated."

01:42:09;01:42:11;"Bill I wonder if you know anything about this"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"because later in the Duncan"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"story we talked about this with him a bit"
01:42:15;01:42:17;"we're the victim of a hostile takeover"
01:42:17;01:42:19;"in the late 80s. Really?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"Yeah and it's actually it's very like"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"succession. I know you're a big succession"
01:42:23;01:42:25;"head and billions head. Oh yeah."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"So that makes me think that you know a lot about"
01:42:27;01:42:29;"business. [Laughter]"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"Which you at least partially do."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"Talking and reading the book it sounds like"
01:42:33;01:42:35;"this is like the worst year of this dude's life."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"80s were great. They introduced Fred"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"the Baker. Business is a booming."
01:42:39;01:42:41;"He watches the stock price kind of going up"
01:42:41;01:42:43;"and he's like ""Great!"""
01:42:43;01:42:45;"""The streets liking what we're selling but then it's going up a little"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"too much."" And he gets a call like"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"""Bob it's a hostile takeover."""
01:42:49;01:42:51;"""Is this Canadian company?"" And then he had to literally"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"he had seven months to scramble to go like"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"very succession-esque"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"to make sure like enough of the"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"shareholders were on his side and they couldn't quite"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"do it. So then the last ditch effort they had to find"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"they had to sell themselves to somebody else."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"You had to sell the company to an English"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"company. What year is that? I think"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"it was '89. Okay."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"It's like such a specific question"
01:43:11;01:43:13;"to ask you but like if we were just"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"hanging out I would ask you this so why not."
01:43:15;01:43:17;"Hostile takeovers are so crazy"
01:43:17;01:43:19;"like why is that allowed?"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"Is that just what happens when you're a publicly traded"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"company? That you put out all these"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"shares and then just some"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"monster can scoop them up?"
01:43:27;01:43:29;"I think so. I think that's the like"
01:43:29;01:43:31;"cost of doing business"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"of having a board. I mean you can get"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"like axed at any time"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"if there's like movement I think."
01:43:37;01:43:39;"I would"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"love to have done more of a deeper dive on"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"the nature of hostile takeovers"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"before."
01:43:45;01:43:47;"Should have given you a heads up."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"And you guys remember in Succession"
01:43:49;01:43:51;"there's that whole arc where they're"
01:43:51;01:43:53;"talking about the bear hug."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"Anybody remember what a bear hug is?"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"Yeah, that's when"
01:43:57;01:43:59;"I mean that's part of Kendall's"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"takeover right? They're going to pressure them."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Isn't that what, isn't that when"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"that happens? That's when they start talking about the bear hug."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"Isn't that just a euphemism?"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Maybe it's like a same umbrella term of like"
01:44:09;01:44:11;"getting either shareholders"
01:44:11;01:44:13;"or board members on your side to"
01:44:13;01:44:15;"squeeze somebody to make them do what you"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"want. Whether that's step"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"down, sell the company, whatever."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"A bear, okay. What is"
01:44:21;01:44:23;"a bear hug? In business a bear hug is"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"an offer made by one company to buy"
01:44:25;01:44:27;"the shares of another for a much higher"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"share price than what the"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"company is worth in the market."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"It's an acquisition strategy."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"Where if you come in at the right number"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"Yeah, so it's"
01:44:37;01:44:39;"not the hostile takeover."
01:44:39;01:44:41;"I guess it would be hostile takeover"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"adjacent in that you want"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"that you know if it came from the inside"
01:44:45;01:44:47;"as it does in Succession from"
01:44:47;01:44:49;"Kendall. He's basically like I need to"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"get another company to pressure to"
01:44:51;01:44:53;"buy it. So it's not from"
01:44:53;01:44:55;"it's in collusion with another"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"company and that's how you'll acquire it."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"So I think it's you know maybe"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"not always a hostile"
01:45:01;01:45:03;"takeover but certainly in Succession"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"because it's Kendall that wants"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"to take over his father's business and he doesn't"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"have the money. He's going to go"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"to that hedge fund or that other"
01:45:11;01:45:13;"company and say hey we're going"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"to pressure, we're going to lower the"
01:45:15;01:45:17;"shares or whatever and let"
01:45:17;01:45:19;"you come in and take it over. Makes sense?"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"Yeah, more or less."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"The idea that any of us are"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"like I don't even watch"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"I don't even watch Billions."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"I love Billions."
01:45:29;01:45:33;"We should start a"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"finance company and just like the first question"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"we ask everybody is like do you watch Succession"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"and Billions? Anybody who says"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"one or zero, get the f*ck out of here."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"We need people who understand"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"all of finance. I find"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"there's a TV commercial"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"with Kieran Culkin"
01:45:49;01:45:51;"and Paul Giamatti. I don't even remember"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"what the commercial's for but it is"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"like the first Billions"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Succession official crossover that"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"I'm aware of. Oh they were having some fun with that."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"Wait and by the way"
01:46:01;01:46:03;"did we ever talk on the show about the fact"
01:46:03;01:46:05;"that Logan Roy"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"the father from Succession, what's"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"the actor's name? Brian Cox."
01:46:09;01:46:11;"Brian Cox became the voice of McDonald's"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"for a while. Did we ever talk"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"about that on Time Crisis? Seinfeld, do you"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"remember? I don't think so. We haven't."
01:46:17;01:46:19;"Okay so Brian Cox became"
01:46:19;01:46:21;"the voice of McDonald's and"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"clearly they also"
01:46:23;01:46:25;"hired him. I'm sure similar to"
01:46:25;01:46:27;"whoever did the commercial with"
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Giamatti and Kieran Culkin because they wanted"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"a little bit of that Succession heat and they"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"liked that kind of dangerous"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"billionaire finance thing"
01:46:35;01:46:37;"because my memory"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"of the commercials is he's not on screen but"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"it's his voice and it's just always like"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"it's always funny when they do commercials like that. Like obviously"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"they're not going to go clear the character but they can go"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"straight to the actor to kind of be the character."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"So he says some like"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"""F*** off"""
01:46:51;01:46:53;"basically where he's like"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"""If your friend says they"
01:46:55;01:46:57;"don't want fries"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"you still better go ahead and buy"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"two fries because"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"they'll try to take your fries and they'll"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"no longer be your friend."""
01:47:05;01:47:07;"He just says like some intense business"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"about sharing fries but the best part is"
01:47:09;01:47:11;"that at the end he goes"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"""Dun dun dun dun dun"""
01:47:13;01:47:15;"It's like husky voice"
01:47:15;01:47:17;"he goes, can we get one of those up?"
01:47:17;01:47:19;"They're just so good. ""Dun dun dun dun dun"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"F*** off!"""

01:57:17;01:57:19;"and f*ck."
01:57:19;01:57:21;"Just naked women. I just don't know."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"Probably for Robert it's gonna be a lateral"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"move. Yeah, there's kind of no version"
01:57:25;01:57:27;"of it. I mean, alright,"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"I'm just gonna have to get a really good DP"
01:57:29;01:57:31;"and just have donut making scenes"
01:57:31;01:57:33;"to all this music that"
01:57:33;01:57:35;"just really bring you"
01:57:35;01:57:37;"in. I guess it's gotta be food porn."
01:57:37;01:57:39;"We gotta watch some Tucci,"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"some old Bourdain's. We're gonna try"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"to make kind of aggressive food porn"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"with the donut and with the"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"coffee. Well, yeah, if you did do"
01:57:47;01:57:49;"kind of like..."
01:57:49;01:57:51;"The first shot is maybe like that third song"
01:57:51;01:57:53;"we listened to, slow-mo pulling"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"out as though it's like"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"brain splattered against the wall"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"but then it's just jelly from a jelly donut."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"Right, exactly. A lot of tips of the hat."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"And you know what?"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Maybe I gotta do some research. Obviously"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"the reason that he wrote this book"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"was to share his like"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"the lessons he learned"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"primarily with business people or people interested"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"in how businesses work."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"He actually doesn't put himself"
01:58:17;01:58:19;"out there too much in the book because I think it's"
01:58:19;01:58:21;"besides the point. But"
01:58:21;01:58:23;"you gotta wonder, I mean,"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"organized crime in Boston,"
01:58:25;01:58:27;"that's a thing."
01:58:27;01:58:29;"Meanwhile, these guys are"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"by franchising out."
01:58:31;01:58:33;"You know, and I feel like"
01:58:33;01:58:35;"this has been touched on in The Sopranos"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"and stuff like the 60s in some ways"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"was like a type of peak for the"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"mob, the early 60s. But at the"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"same time, it was the beginning of the end because some"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"of like the old"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"shakedown techniques don't work quite"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"as well in a world of like global"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"finance and chain stores and stuff."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"You know what I mean?"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Yeah, there's a great scene I actually just watched"
01:58:55;01:58:57;"the other night where"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"Holly's trying to go shakedown or one of"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"the crews trying to shakedown"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"an old store and they're like, or tries"
01:59:03;01:59:05;"to go to basically a Jamba Juice"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"and is like, give me,"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"you know, you owe me."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"I skim this off the top and the guy's like, I can't do that."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"Like every cent is accounted for here."
01:59:13;01:59:15;"Like there's no skimming off"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"the top. Yeah, and he's kind of like, we've run"
01:59:17;01:59:19;"this neighborhood forever."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"And it's like, how could I even do that?"
01:59:21;01:59:23;"We have a computerized system that goes to corporate."
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Like, what do you want me to do, sir?"
01:59:25;01:59:27;"Exactly. And then that's actually one"
01:59:27;01:59:29;"that might have been like a Starbucks"
01:59:29;01:59:31;"because then Tony"
01:59:31;01:59:33;"gets an offer to sell"
01:59:33;01:59:35;"one of his like local pieces"
01:59:35;01:59:37;"of real estate to a Jamba Juice."
01:59:37;01:59:39;"And I remember that being pretty"
01:59:39;01:59:41;"funny. Okay, I just"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Googled just to see Mafia"
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Dunkin Donuts."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"And there's a 2009 story"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"from the Daily News"
01:59:49;01:59:51;"that says mobster Anthony"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"Anastasio,"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"80, older fella,"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"convicted of extortion and ordering the"
01:59:57;01:59:59;"torturing of Dunkin Donuts."
01:59:59;02:00:01;"So here's something right here."
02:00:01;02:00:03;"Anthony Anastasio"
02:00:03;02:00:05;"was found guilty of shaking down a"
02:00:05;02:00:07;"trucking company on the Staten Island waterfront"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"and ordering"
02:00:09;02:00:11;"a Dunkin Donuts torch for the insurance money."
02:00:11;02:00:13;"Alright, that's something."
02:00:13;02:00:15;"We could work with that."
02:00:15;02:00:17;"First scene."
02:00:17;02:00:19;"Anastasio, long time mob soldier, is the nephew"
02:00:19;02:00:21;"of legendary mafioso Albert"
02:00:21;02:00:23;"Anastasio. They keep saying"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"different names for these guys. It's funny."
02:00:25;02:00:27;"They don't know what they're talking about in this article."
02:00:27;02:00:29;"Who was gunned down while getting a shave"
02:00:29;02:00:31;"in a barber shop at the Park Sheridan Hotel"
02:00:31;02:00:33;"in 1957."
02:00:33;02:00:35;"Alright, there's something there."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"Well,"
02:00:37;02:00:39;"thanks so much everybody for coming through."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Bayo, thanks for joining us."

02:00:43;02:00:45;"to the Fidel Longstreth"
02:00:45;02:00:47;"household. Thank you so"
02:00:47;02:00:49;"much to Bob Rosenberg"
