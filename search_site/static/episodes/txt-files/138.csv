00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. The final show of 2020 is here. We're joined by longtime"
00:08;00:13;"friends of the show, Winter the Starbucking God and Rashida Jones."
00:13;00:20;"We'll be talking music, Starbucks and everything that happened in this eventful year."
00:21;00:30;"Long pause. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:24;"Time Crisis back again. What's up Jake? The usual. Yeah, just painting, crushing"
01:24;01:30;"burritos. Actually haven't really been doing burritos. Are burritos played out? I"
01:30;01:36;"think 2020 is my lowest burrito intake of any year in the last, I want to say 20"
01:36;01:41;"years. Is that because of the COVID-19 pandemic? I think it is. I don't, for"
01:41;01:46;"whatever reason, I mean I will get, you know, to go food like pizzas and stuff"
01:46;01:53;"occasionally, but I, for some reason the burrito sort of taqueria world kind of, it"
01:53;01:56;"hasn't been in my regular rotation the way it usually is. Even breakfast"
01:56;02:01;"burritos? Okay, well I will do a breakfast burrito occasionally. I got a question"
02:01;02:07;"for you. How many times in your life have you made a burrito? Many. At home? Oh yeah,"
02:07;02:14;"hundreds. Oh, hundreds? Sure. You've made hundreds of burritos? Yeah. What about you? A true"
02:14;02:21;"burrito? I think possibly zero. You've never made a burrito? This is shocking."
02:21;02:27;"Kicking this episode off with a bang. Have I made a burrito? I've made quesadillas."
02:27;02:34;"Sure. I've made tacos and I've certainly made all sorts of like dumbass wraps. I"
02:34;02:40;"can think of like many times in my life where I like grabbed like a some kind of"
02:40;02:45;"like random tortilla out of the fridge and you know put like a slice of turkey,"
02:45;02:54;"some buffalo sauce, some sprouts, and maybe some like shredded parmesan. I've"
02:54;02:58;"made s*** like that. That's called a turkey burrito. Is it really a burrito if you"
02:58;03:01;"don't like fold it like a burrito? If I make a burrito, sometimes I'll make like"
03:01;03:06;"a pot of beans. Yeah. And then that's sitting in the fridge for a few days and"
03:06;03:12;"maybe there's like a Whole Foods like rotisserie chicken or not. And then the"
03:12;03:15;"burrito is sort of like the big tortilla. You put some beans in there, maybe some"
03:15;03:20;"shredded chicken, grate a little cheddar on there, maybe throw in an avo if you"
03:20;03:24;"have it. That's the burrito, man. Right, but then do you like fold the bottom? Oh,"
03:24;03:27;"yeah, you kind of like put the ingredients mostly in the middle. Kind of."
03:27;03:31;"And then you kind of give yourself like a bottom fold so you're not losing"
03:31;03:41;"enough bottom end. And then do you wrap it in tinfoil? That would be..."
03:41;03:47;"That's a weird period of your life. Just like single, years deep. Maybe that's like a"
03:47;03:50;"version of your life where I feel like I remember a long time ago. Could we have"
03:50;03:54;"been driving somewhere or just chatting? And I just remember you talking about"
03:54;03:57;"like saying you thought it might be your destiny to one day live in like the deep"
03:57;04:01;"desert. Does that ring a bell? Yeah, absolutely. We might have also just been"
04:01;04:06;"shooting the s***. Like would you rather live in like middle of nowhere, Arizona,"
04:06;04:12;"like trailer in a desert or Alaska? And I think I went with the cold spot and"
04:12;04:15;"you're like I'd do the desert. But anyway, now I'm just picturing you like a"
04:15;04:20;"different version of your life. Just like solo, painting, 20 miles from the nearest"
04:20;04:24;"convenience store, like weird like Breaking Bad trailer in the desert and"
04:24;04:27;"just entertaining yourself by making burritos and then just like wrapping in"
04:27;04:32;"tinfoil and just be like one rotisserie chick burrito for Jake. Then you go to"
04:32;04:36;"the other side of the table, grab it like thank you. Like a weird desert"
04:36;04:43;"version of Castaway. Desert burrito. But anyway, your burrito consumption has"
04:43;04:48;"plummeted this year. Yeah. Have you been painting just as much if not more in"
04:48;04:52;"these troubled times? I've been putting in big hours. Okay. Which has been great."
04:52;04:58;"Yeah and I actually noticed that in that article about you that I did an"
04:58;05:04;"interview for Seinfeld. Oh yeah, with Caitlyn. Yeah, shout out to Caitlyn. What was it?"
05:04;05:09;"Where was it published? Inside Hook. Okay, shout out to Inside Hook. The Inside Hook"
05:09;05:14;"profile, Jake, a clock that you said you're putting 40-hour work weeks? Yeah."
05:14;05:18;"Is that like Monday through Friday, eight hours a day? It's Monday through Friday,"
05:18;05:25;"usually around like 10, 30 or 11 to about 6, which is all that's like maybe 35"
05:25;05:29;"hours or something. And then usually a Saturday or Sunday I'll go in there for"
05:29;05:33;"five hours. Especially nowadays, there's like there's nothing going on like"
05:33;05:37;"socially or anything. So it's just sort of like... Right. But I mean even before COVID, I"
05:37;05:42;"was always doing about 40 hours, 30 to 40 hours a week. Yeah, it's a very reasonable"
05:42;05:47;"schedule. What's your schedule like with the recording? I mean it's so all over"
05:47;05:53;"the place. I think compared to painting, there's very... it's very rare that there's"
05:53;05:59;"like a long stretch, no pun intended, of needing to diligently put hours in."
05:59;06:03;"Certainly we could be there for an eight-hour day and I think you know as"
06:03;06:08;"time's gone on, just like staying late has gotten less and less appealing. Yeah."
06:08;06:14;"Now maybe being a little older, obviously I like to come see the family. But also"
06:14;06:20;"when you come straight home from like working, you're like super tired, go"
06:20;06:24;"straight to sleep. It's nice to have like a couple hour buffer at least. So yeah, I"
06:24;06:29;"don't know. We rarely have like a 40-hour workweek until the very end. And I think"
06:29;06:34;"especially now, I kind of realize like we've always been kind of like fits and"
06:34;06:39;"starts style. There's not always something to do."
07:03;07:08;"Well this is the last time crisis of the year. Can you believe it? We made it to"
07:08;07:14;"the end of 2020. Weird. Yeah, I mean what were we even talking about in January 20?"
07:14;07:20;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch? What were some of the big topics of January 2020, TC?"
07:20;07:26;"Alright, well we started the year with with Amy Brown from Wendy's Twitter."
07:26;07:32;"Whoa, that feels like years ago. We talked about the Super Bowl when that was a"
07:32;07:37;"thing. Who played in the Super Bowl this year? I don't know. Good question."
07:37;07:43;"The Patriots? Yeah. Vikings. Oh no, no, no, no. It was the 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs."
07:43;07:49;"Oh right. And Kansas City won. That does feel like it was five years ago. Right."
07:49;07:56;"Oh, the first appearance of the phrase ""What about vampire man?"" That was this year?"
07:56;08:03;"February. That was after the Grammys. What about vampire man?"
08:04;08:11;"Ferrara versus Ferrara and Butterfinger were all big topics. Oh wow."
08:11;08:19;"That was this year? Okay, that feels more recent. That was Q1. Well, our last IRL TC, our"
08:19;08:27;"guest was Megan and Pearl from NJGov Twitter handle. Okay. Oh yeah. You remember that?"
08:27;08:33;"Sure. That was a long time ago. Ezra, did Father of the Bride remind me what"
08:33;08:38;"happened at the Grammys this year? Did it win Best Alternative? It won Best Alternative."
08:38;08:44;"Okay. But it lost. That's big. Thank you. I appreciate the congratulations and if I could"
08:44;08:54;"pay that forward for a second, I want to congratulate the Kansas City Chiefs on their big win. Yeah,"
08:54;09:00;"lost the rock song category and lost AOTY, you know, but it's to Billie Eilish. Shout out to"
09:00;09:07;"her. It is funny to think we did play some shows in this calendar year. We went to Iowa with Bernie"
09:07;09:14;"and we played probably what was the last big music festival in the United States, Okeechobee"
09:14;09:21;"in Florida. That was that one final trip, a very cold night in Florida. I do vividly remember just"
09:21;09:27;"like saying goodbye to everybody, some of the crew dudes. I remember me and Bayo were both the"
09:27;09:31;"most wary of if we were ever going to play a show again because our next shows were going to be in"
09:31;09:35;"South America. So there's a lot of like... Wait, you knew it was your last show of the year?"
09:35;09:41;"No, no, no. It was a real question mark. So it was still a moment where you had very differing"
09:41;09:47;"opinions. So we played the show saying goodbye to everybody and some people were like, ""See you in"
09:47;09:51;"South America,"" because that was in like two or three weeks from then. And I just kind of remember"
09:51;09:57;"some people being like, ""Well, we'll see, man."" And they're like, ""Oh, come on. This is not that"
09:57;10:04;"serious."" But in fact, every single show was canceled. So we've been doing Quarantine TC for"
10:04;10:12;"nine months. Nine months. Well, we made it work. Kind of sucks. I want to say not only did we make"
10:12;10:18;"it work, I think that we found a rhythm and it thrived in it. Obviously, I want to see you guys."
10:18;10:22;"Yeah. I do think that we've figured out something that has been special."
10:22;10:32;"I don't know if it's special, but I think we're making do. I think IRL is going to be great to"
10:32;10:37;"get back to. I can't speak to the audio quality, but I do think in terms of the content, we still"
10:37;10:41;"had some good material this year. Even just looking back on the last few months, I mean,"
10:41;10:47;"I don't think I've ever gotten more messages from a TC interview than for Bob Weir."
10:47;10:48;"That was a good interview."
10:48;10:53;"And then other side of the coin, we had Garfield Eats, very controversial. Nathan"
10:53;10:57;"Cumminant Hot. But you know what? I think those are both classic interviews. And I just think"
10:57;11:01;"they're two dudes at different moments in their life, bringing different energy."
11:01;11:10;"Controversial within the listening community and within the TC family. I'm not going to say more,"
11:10;11:17;"but some people in this community are very pro Nathan Marzi and some are very anti."
11:17;11:24;"Listen, family doesn't agree on everything, but I do think on the TC thread, Nick put it well,"
11:24;11:29;"where he said, it's like when Jerry used to invite the Hells Angels to come hang and party"
11:29;11:33;"at the Dead Shows. Some people would be like, these guys aren't hippies. They're bringing this"
11:33;11:39;"harsh energy, bothering everybody. And Jerry's vibe was kind of like, listen, it's okay if people"
11:39;11:44;"don't understand, but my worldview is very nonjudgmental. They deserve to be here just as"
11:44;11:48;"much as the peace, love and hippies. Garfield Eats is our Hells Angels."
11:48;11:52;"I wonder if the Dead kept the Hells Angels around after Ultimat."
11:52;11:58;"That would be the ultimate test. When an organization is really getting some bad"
11:58;12:06;"press, do you maintain your everyone is welcome policy? But anyway, I am pro having Nathan back."
12:06;12:11;"We have heard through the grapevine that he has a new venture called Scooby Eats,"
12:11;12:20;"which is based on the Scooby-Doo IP. And I am legitimately curious about it because I'll tell"
12:20;12:26;"you what, I'd love to get Nathan back in for talking about this way too much. People are"
12:26;12:29;"just like, Jesus Christ, somebody missed that episode. And they're just listening to this,"
12:29;12:36;"like just kind of meta commentary. But first of all, I don't think anybody should judge somebody"
12:36;12:43;"based on one 20 minute interview, because if any of us had to do a 20 minute interview in one of"
12:43;12:49;"the stickiest situations of our life, we might be coming in hot. So I'm very curious about what's up"
12:49;12:54;"with Scooby Eats. How is it different from Garfield Eats? How is the pizza shaped? And"
12:54;13:02;"what has Nathan learned? Because truly adversity makes somebody stronger. And it wouldn't surprise"
13:02;13:08;"me given on all the he had to deal with launching Garfield Eats, if Scooby Eats is much more"
13:08;13:13;"successful, because you learn from failure. I bet there's a lot of things he wouldn't do the same"
13:13;13:19;"after realizing just how hot the streets are in the restaurant business. - Let's give him six"
13:19;13:26;"months to get on his feet and then revisit. - Okay, fair. But you heard it here, folks. In"
13:26;13:34;"May 2021, we are going to reach out to Nathan Marzi. - No, no, no, no, no. Not a guaranteed"
13:34;13:39;"reach out. I meant revisit within the TC boardroom. We'll take a vote. - Okay, well,"
13:39;13:45;"the board of directors will convene. - Yeah. - And we'll discuss this. It would be a maverick"
13:45;13:48;"move to have him back. And I can imagine some of the more conservative members of the board"
13:48;13:55;"getting cold feet about it. Bob Iger wanted to buy Marvel. And people said, ""What do you want"
13:55;14:00;"that for? A bunch of comic book characters? What does that have to do with Disney? We already got"
14:00;14:08;"Mickey Mouse. What do we need Thor for? Who's gonna spend money to see a Thor movie?"" And the"
14:08;14:12;"rest is history. But yeah, we'll see. But here's the thing, Jake. I'm not gonna just recommend"
14:12;14:17;"having him back on the show. I'm gonna force a vote to buy a majority stake of Scooby Eats."
14:17;14:24;"- Hopefully Tim Cook's available for that board meeting. - Time Crisis has purchased a controlling"
14:24;14:31;"stake in Scooby Eats. Wall Street analysts consider the deal to be wildly overvalued."
14:31;14:39;"The TC stock is plummeting. And I'm just like, ""Listen, guys, things are gonna stabilize. Things"
14:39;14:43;"are gonna stabilize. Trust the process."""
14:50;15:19;"Well, we got a big show today. As discussed last week, when we had Kazzy David on,"
15:19;15:27;"we're having two more members of the TC family. First, Winter, the king of Starbucking. And second,"
15:27;15:32;"Rashida Jones. But before we get to our illustrious guests, I guess we got to talk"
15:32;15:37;"about this KFC thing. I'll admit, I've been hesitant to talk about it because I've been"
15:37;15:42;"having a bit of a philosophical crisis. I don't know if we ever got to the bottom of this,"
15:42;15:48;"but I feel like in the years we've been doing this show, we've learned a lot about advertising"
15:48;15:52;"and marketing. We've watched the way that social media and Twitter has kind of changed"
15:52;15:59;"the game for brands. We try to examine what these brands are doing to us. We met the people."
15:59;16:04;"We talked about Amy Brown from Wendy's. We talked to our boy from Steakums. Of course,"
16:04;16:08;"Pluckers. We've met a lot of social media managers for brands. We've tried to understand"
16:08;16:15;"the people behind this stuff. But we have reached this point where truly the people"
16:15;16:20;"working marketing and brand management for these companies, they're just like us. There's"
16:20;16:26;"no daylight anymore. They just do s*** to make people like us talk about it. I feel"
16:26;16:30;"like we've reached the brand singularity. Do you know what I mean, Jake? There used"
16:30;16:35;"to be space where it's like, me and you could be sitting on a couch, Beavis and Butthead"
16:35;16:40;"style, watch some dumbass ad and talk and think about what are they trying to do to"
16:40;16:47;"us here? Who made this? Joke about it. But now it's like we're all in the same swamp."
16:47;16:51;"It's almost like there used to be, brands used to do things just to get attention and"
16:51;16:56;"everybody would kind of roll their eyes and be like, yeah, swing and a miss. You wanted"
16:56;17:01;"us to talk about it? Well, guess what? We are talking about it in a negative way. We're"
17:01;17:05;"making fun of it. You know what I mean? There used to be that kind of distance. Whereas"
17:05;17:11;"now it's like brands do straight up funny s***. It's almost Trump-esque in a way. Where"
17:11;17:16;"it's like part of Trump's rise to power was like realizing that laughing at him and mocking"
17:16;17:22;"him only made him stronger. You just go out there, do his standup routines, say f***ed"
17:22;17:27;"up s*** and there's literally nothing that anybody could say about him that he couldn't"
17:27;17:34;"absorb just to become more famous and arguably more powerful. And truly the thing that actually"
17:34;17:41;"felled him was not satire, was not people being irate about him. It kind of like took"
17:41;17:46;"a virus to take this dude down. The human solution was very difficult in his case. So"
17:46;17:52;"anyway, that leads us to the big topic of conversation. That KFC and Lifetime released"
17:52;18:00;"a movie, A Recipe for Seduction, a 15 minute mini movie starring Mario Lopez as a sexy"
18:00;18:05;"Colonel Sanders. And there's just something about this one that to me truly is like the"
18:05;18:06;"singularity of that."
18:06;18:13;"Yeah, it's too on the nose. A lot of people tagged us on Twitter and Instagram about this"
18:13;18:16;"thing. And it's just like, it's too TC."
18:16;18:22;"Can I tell you about something I just read? It's an article about this KFC Lifetime movie"
18:22;18:29;"and sort of the history of sponsored content and this kind of branded content for TV and"
18:29;18:32;"you know that they're doing. And they said, obviously this is something people have been"
18:32;18:38;"going for for a while. And they had a moment. But in talking about how other brands have"
18:38;18:44;"been trying to crack the branded content, they say some efforts, this is from Variety,"
18:44;18:51;"some efforts have been decidedly more creative. Arby's in 2014 released a 13 hour commercial"
18:51;18:57;"talking about how it smoked brisket. The marathon spot played out only on a local My Network"
18:57;19:02;"affiliate in Duluth, Minnesota. But word of the stunt was enough to lure 350,000 unique"
19:02;19:08;"visitors to watch the video on a website where the average visit lasted 38 minutes."
19:08;19:11;"Wow. That's like some Warhol movie."
19:11;19:14;"Yeah, I'm pretty into that."
19:14;19:17;"Static shot for 13 hours of slow roasting beef."
19:17;19:22;"Yeah, I guess also, you know, Warhol has his detractors too. There's probably somebody"
19:22;19:27;"who's just like, I get what you're doing here, but this is not real art, sir."
19:27;19:28;"I guarantee it."
19:28;19:32;"Well, I know somebody must have felt that way, but they're just like, you know what?"
19:32;19:38;"Because you, I know it's like, haha, seems cool, whatever. You're making Campbell's Soup"
19:38;19:43;"ads, you know, Prince, selling them back to like Rich Madison Avenue executives who probably"
19:43;19:47;"worked on the Campbell's Soup campaign. But you know what? This ends in one place, Mr."
19:47;19:54;"Warhol. This ends in a 14 hour Arby's commercial on a Duluth affiliate. Like, I wonder if there's"
19:54;20:00;"anybody who saw like the full circle coming. But that said, I do think in a more positive"
20:00;20:07;"way, part of the TC ethos/Plucker's ethos is it's a dumb time to be alive. You play"
20:07;20:12;"the hand you're dealt, try to have fun, do your best to make the world a better place."
20:12;20:17;"But like, you know, I could kind of relate to whoever was working at the Arby's ad agency"
20:17;20:22;"back then. I would be pretty psyched if I ended up in advertising. Maybe it's just like"
20:22;20:28;"the job I happen to get. And I actually convinced Arby's to make a 14 hour commercial. Like,"
20:28;20:32;"I would be very proud of myself. That person should be proud. Within your job, you did"
20:32;20:37;"something cool and weird. You did make the world a vibier place."
20:37;20:41;"I mean, we joke about the like, bastard grads who go into advertising, but like, to me,"
20:41;20:47;"it sounds like someone has like an MFA and is into like, very long form, like minimalist"
20:47;20:52;"art. Yeah. Like the Warhol film of like a static shot of the Empire State Building for"
20:52;20:56;"12 hours. I mean, I don't even know what the art that ad was. I'm just picturing like the"
20:56;21:02;"slow roasting pork. It reminds me in college, my friend Jason, I played in a band with,"
21:02;21:08;"he got into making like weird minimalist films. We like went to Taco Bell and he like filmed"
21:08;21:15;"me and Adam Forkner eating Taco Bell, just like static shot. And then we get to track"
21:15;21:18;"that down. Yeah. No, but like, there was like Saturday"
21:18;21:23;"night movies, like at the, in like the big auditorium at my college, you know? And like,"
21:23;21:27;"like Jason was involved in the programming of the movies, but he would play his weird"
21:27;21:31;"like video art before the movie as like a trailer. And there was one time there was"
21:31;21:35;"screen screening, like, I don't know, like Die Hard or something. And then it was like"
21:35;21:40;"the first five minutes was just me and Adam eating Taco Bell, but then over it, but this"
21:40;21:46;"is the sick part. This is the sick part over it. He just dubbed over Pearl Jam, Jeremy."
21:46;21:52;"And it's just like, at home, they're all in big shoes. It's just like me and Adam eating"
21:52;21:58;"like seven layer burritos at like a Taco Bell in Portland. And it's just like, that's it."
21:58;22:03;"No camera movement. That was the whole video. Was there like weird murmuring in the audience"
22:03;22:09;"from people like confused? People hated. Okay. So it's like the premiere of Stravinsky's"
22:09;22:18;"Rites of Spring. Oh yeah. People get agitated. It was the Taco Bell, the Taco Bell riots"
22:18;22:25;"at Lewis and Clark College. I just love how aggressively minimal and nonsensical that"
22:25;22:31;"sort of video art was. Did you ever see the Andy Warhol Burger King Super Bowl commercial"
22:31;22:37;"where Andy Warhol is just eating a Burger King burger? Oh, and like he's in it. Yeah."
22:37;22:44;"You know, I've seen references to that before. Wow. Yeah. It was taken from a 1982 film called"
22:44;22:50;"66 scenes from America, like an art house film by this guy, Jorgen Leth. But it made"
22:50;22:56;"me think like, Jake, how would you feel if your, if that Taco Bell video was like repurposed"
22:56;23:02;"posthumously for a real Taco Bell ad, you know, in 70 years or something or now? Oh"
23:02;23:07;"yeah. There you go. Well, I don't want to die right now, but, um, or it doesn't have"
23:07;23:12;"to be posthumously just that fact. I mean, yeah, I'm in touch with Jason. I bet he has"
23:12;23:16;"those videos. I want to see it. I mean, track that down because the Taco Bell doesn't buy"
23:16;23:22;"it. Maybe vampire weekend. Well, you got to get clearance from Pearl Jam. Well, you got"
23:22;23:30;"to get, I think I'd reply. Wait, it's just like, it's just vampire weekend, Jeremy. And"
23:30;23:36;"then people are like, wait, is this a cover? And just be like, well, through the artistic"
23:36;23:43;"process of transferring this 1997 VHS, we did in fact, remix it. This is vampire weekends"
23:43;23:49;"version of it. We did use the original recording from 10 as source material. However, this"
23:49;23:54;"is vampire weekends version. We like, we get on the phone with, with Pearl Jam's lawyers."
23:54;23:58;"We're like, so we want to like present this as the, as vampire weekends version. We're"
23:58;24:02;"just like, so how do you want to split the master? And the lawyer's like, we'll take"
24:02;24:08;"a hundred percent. We're like, Oh, we're thinking 50 50. I mean, this is the vampire version,"
24:08;24:14;"you know, like any audio file will be able to detect the difference. Dude, that is the"
24:14;24:21;"most like up your own ass, like art art school theory. Like there are like very like historically"
24:21;24:26;"where there's, I can think of one historically prominent photographer and her whole thing"
24:26;24:30;"was like photographing, rephotographing famous photographs."
24:30;24:35;"Like she would rephotograph like a Dorothea Lange migrant mother photo or rephotograph"
24:35;24:40;"like a Walker Evans, you know, depression era portrait of someone. And then that was"
24:40;24:44;"her art. And it was like this whole thing about like, what does authorship even mean,"
24:44;24:53;"man? Like that kind of stuff. Right. Right. I loved just vampire weekend releases a low"
24:53;24:58;"five version of Pearl Jam's Jeremy. I'm trying to think as any, somebody must've done that."
24:58;25:03;"I mean, you've definitely heard where people have gone beyond sampling and straight up"
25:03;25:08;"just like sang over an entire song. There's obviously, I guess you could call it instances"
25:08;25:14;"of extreme samplings. I definitely can't think of like a prominent artist just like straight"
25:14;25:22;"up being like the, would you like an artist statement? Like the patina created by the"
25:22;25:32;"VHS transferred to YouTube plus the 23 years of time is our authorship. We did not contact"
25:32;25:38;"Pearl Jam because of course, as artists, they will understand that this is our Jeremy."
25:38;25:43;"Completely gaslighting Pearl Jam. We released an official soundtrack to Portland, Oregon,"
25:43;25:49;"Taco Bell in 1997 by Jason Anderson. But okay. If we don't want to go that poor hazy and"
25:49;25:54;"we could also just slap it on a new vampire song. Maybe I've maybe got to write one that"
25:54;26:01;"has a kind of young Jake Taco Bell energy. Yeah. Think about this incredibly low five,"
26:01;26:09;"terrible VHS quality. Me like very standing young and like pale with a very young Adam"
26:09;26:15;"Forkner, the two of us eating burritos at Taco Bell. Great teal vibe. Oh, like the old"
26:15;26:25;"Taco Bells. Yeah. The jazzy Taco Bells. Right. Teal with like highlights of salmon. Teal"
26:25;26:37;"Taco Bell. At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops with him on top. Lemon yellow sun, arms"
26:37;27:07;"raised in a V, dead lay in pools of maroon below. Daddy didn't give attention to the fact that mommy didn't care. King Jeremy is the wicked. Oh, this world's an only spoken place."
27:07;27:27;"Here's the question. What Pearl Jam song do you think Vampire Weekend could cover live?"
27:27;27:32;"Or like if someone was like gunned ahead, you need to do a Pearl Jam cover live next"
27:32;27:38;"year or I'm going to kill your parents. Jesus Christ. It's got to be like a regular part"
27:38;27:42;"of the set. Yeah. You're like, okay, I got big guys. We got to do a Pearl Jam cover next"
27:42;27:47;"year. I think I already know what it is. I think we talked about their fourth album once,"
27:47;27:53;"Jake, their fourth album, no code, which threw some fans for a loop, but actually had some"
27:53;27:58;"strong songs. And there was my local radio station played one of the singles a lot. That's"
27:58;28:02;"called who you are. It's like kind of like a droney Indian Pearl Jam song. Just kind"
28:02;28:10;"of like the drums. I always thought it was like a very pretty song. And you know, as"
28:10;28:14;"a student of rock history, I've definitely spent some time digging into Pearl Jam set"
28:14;28:19;"lists because they switch up set lists a lot. So I'm always curious about bands who do that"
28:19;28:24;"because obviously that's become a real priority for vampire. Just, but you know, it takes"
28:24;28:28;"some figuring out like how much do you keep the same every night? How different, how much"
28:28;28:31;"do you like spread out the albums? And I've noticed that they don't play that song too"
28:31;28:36;"often. So I feel like it wouldn't be quite as crazy as just like, if we just bust it"
28:36;28:42;"out, like alive or Jeremy, first of all, I think I would sound terrible singing that."
28:42;28:50;"I'm like no Herm Yarl. I'm no Herm Yarl. I got no Herm or Yarl. There's no Herm in my"
28:50;28:55;"Yarl. If I had to pick some of my favorite Pearl Jam songs, I might say yellow lead better."
28:55;29:00;"I know Jake, you said that song doesn't cut the mustard, but I'm a fan. I might pick better"
29:00;29:05;"man. I can't, none of these songs are going to sound good with vampire. Dude, corduroy."
29:05;29:10;"Wait, is that the waiting drove me mad? Yeah. Oh, that's a great song. Let me try to sing"
29:10;29:26;"that like Nick. All right. Eddie would go, I'd go, I actually can't even find a way in."
29:26;29:33;"I'm going pop punk now. Yeah. I can't find a way in on that. Maybe you could do like"
29:33;29:42;"a David Byrne kind of thing. The waiting drove me. I can do David Bowie. The wedding drove"
29:42;29:52;"me mad. I can't find a way in man. I can do that other one. Or I could do like famous"
29:52;29:58;"Pearl Jam cover, like last kiss. That'd be easy. Yeah. Oh, where, oh, where can my baby"
29:58;30:04;"be? But that's not, that's a cover. It doesn't really count. I can see you doing daughter."
30:04;30:15;"Don't call me daughter. Don't call me daughter. Not fair to me. The picture, the picture kept"
30:15;30:23;"will remind. This is like, I don't know, picturing like, like, uh, once upon a time in Hollywood,"
30:23;30:27;"just like at band practice. And I tried, I'm like, have a second, like go back to like"
30:27;30:32;"my, my dressing room, just like smash everything up. Just like, what the is wrong with you,"
30:32;30:41;"man? You're just like dunking your face in ice water. Ice water's like, okay. All right."
30:41;30:46;"It is hard to find a way in. I mean, here's the thing. I guess that's why Herm Yarl became"
30:46;30:51;"a thing is because Eddie Vedder's voice is so idiosyncratic. It's like in for a penny"
30:51;30:56;"in for a pound. Yeah. And we will talk more about Herm Yarl in the new year. Um, we're"
30:56;30:59;"going to go deep on it. Maybe it'll come up again later. I guess we should get winter"
30:59;31:00;"on the horn."
31:00;31:05;"Let's go to the time crisis hotline."
31:05;31:14;"Hello folks. How are you doing? Winter. Welcome back, man. It's good to see my friends. It's"
31:14;31:21;"very good to see you. I am ready to interact and have contacts with you. Let's do it. First"
31:21;31:27;"things first, I got to congratulate you folks. You've had a heck of a year. All of you. I"
31:27;31:32;"mean, as there is recording again, bio's got an album coming out. That's right. Jake's"
31:32;31:37;"got a ton of buzz. I've seen at least two articles and there's probably been more. I"
31:37;31:43;"mean, he's rockstar level now of the back of mountain Bruce. Yeah. Seinfeld's always"
31:43;31:48;"popular though. You know, I feel like, Oh, and then Jake's wife. Oh, Jake's wife's got"
31:48;31:54;"her show. I just watched the eighth episode and Rashida's got a movie, the TV show and"
31:54;31:59;"the podcast with Bill Gates. She's been busy. That's right. This is a real pep talk session"
31:59;32:06;"for the TC family. I appreciate that winter. I'm not just a, a guest. I'm a fan. All right."
32:06;32:12;"Well, so winter also, you know, let's talk about your year, man. I got to say, we're"
32:12;32:16;"all proud of you and the TC community that, cause we talked to you right when things are"
32:16;32:22;"shutting down, but judging by your Instagram and everybody follows you on social media,"
32:22;32:28;"you haven't let this crazy, terrible year slow you down in terms of star Bucking. You've"
32:28;32:35;"been out there almost like a normal year. I know there's been a lot actually more than"
32:35;32:44;"a normal year really because the pandemic broke the rules when it came to a programming"
32:44;32:51;"defense companies that I've worked for would typically never let a contractor work remotely,"
32:51;33:02;"but they had no choice. So for the first time in my 23 year career as a it contractor, I"
33:02;33:07;"was able to hit the road for a prolonged period of time and work a 40 hour week. We've talked"
33:07;33:12;"to you in the past about how you use wifi and stuff. I know you spend a lot of time"
33:12;33:17;"in Panera's, but when you're actually working a 40 hour a week and you're on the road, star"
33:17;33:23;"Bucking, did you ever hit like a hard wall where like a lack of internet was like messing"
33:23;33:28;"things up? You got the Pentagon calling you just like, where the hell are you? You're"
33:28;33:36;"just like, I'm at the Starbucks. No, no, no. It was, it was never a problem like that."
33:36;33:44;"That is ubiquitous throughout the United States. There was a few stretches where I was offline"
33:44;33:52;"for let's say three, four, five hours. And once I got to the next coffee shop or Panera"
33:52;33:57;"or wherever I had some work stacked up that I needed to hurry up and do, but it generally"
33:57;34:03;"hasn't been a problem. The worst thing was once Starbucks, uh, well, two things, a lot"
34:03;34:10;"of the newer Starbucks will have very slow internet before Google or whatever company"
34:10;34:16;"they're using now comes by and wires them up for the fast internet. So in those cases,"
34:16;34:22;"I needed to get my coffee, check the store off my list, then move on to a nearby store"
34:22;34:27;"that was older and had better wifi. So I could actually work. Then right in the middle of"
34:27;34:34;"November, Starbucks shut down all their lobbies. They got ahead of this second wave or third"
34:34;34:38;"wave of COVID and didn't want to take any chances. That's why you saw me at all these"
34:38;34:45;"Panera's because Panera has kept their lobbies open. Panera's wifi is not as good as Starbucks."
34:45;34:50;"And occasionally I'd run into one where it was almost unusable. Like I would keep getting"
34:50;34:55;"disconnected from my system at work and I would have to pack it up and find another"
34:55;34:58;"Panera, but mostly it's worked out fine."
34:58;35:05;"That's amazing. And also it seems like you've made it through the whole year, crisscrossing"
35:05;35:12;"this country, not just this country, multiple countries doing your thing and, uh, seemed"
35:12;35:17;"to have stayed healthy, COVID free. Were there ever any scares, like somebody got too close"
35:17;35:22;"to you or you were seeing so much of the country, you're in a weird situation that didn't feel"
35:22;35:23;"safe?"
35:23;35:28;"Absolutely. Uh, there were quite a few cafes where I thought either this state doesn't"
35:28;35:35;"have adequate requirements for distancing or this cafe is just ignoring the requirements."
35:35;35:39;"But you know, I, what I would generally try and do is, uh, you know, get a chunk of work"
35:39;35:45;"done and then move on to the next destination as possible. I wouldn't say though that I'm"
35:45;35:50;"necessarily got through the year COVID free. There's really no way for me to have it. I"
35:50;35:55;"tried to get an antibody test done in Houston because I was hanging out at a Starbucks that"
35:55;35:59;"just happened to be next to a clinic, but they never sent me my antibody test results."
35:59;36:03;"And yeah, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the phone trying to get those results"
36:03;36:07;"because ultimately it's not going to change my behavior. I'm still going to mask up. I'm"
36:07;36:11;"still going to social distance. I'm still not going to take risks. I don't care if I"
36:11;36:13;"get the antibodies or not."
36:13;36:16;"Right. Makes sense."
36:21;36:50;"Well, so one thing we definitely want to talk to you about is, you know, I think it's important"
36:50;36:54;"to talk to you about is that you were down Mexico way."
36:54;37:00;"Yeah, that was actually my only other country because I haven't been able to get into Canada."
37:00;37:04;"Ah, because Canada is a lot more hardcore with their COVID protocol."
37:04;37:08;"Absolutely. And, and that's actually one of the places where I've already lost at least"
37:08;37:14;"one store, one out in Newfoundland in St. John's. And I might lose some more because"
37:14;37:18;"they're saying possibly all the way up to 2021, we won't be able to get in. I'm not,"
37:18;37:19;"I don't know."
37:19;37:21;"What do you mean lose a store?"
37:21;37:28;"Like it's gone. It's the one at the chapters in St. John's on Newfoundland. It was actually"
37:28;37:34;"a very old store that used to be licensed. Thus it did not count for me. But then in"
37:34;37:43;"May of 2017, Starbucks took over the remaining 11 Starbucks that were still operated by chapters."
37:43;37:49;"And so they all became eligible for my Starbucks project. But some of them were in remote locations."
37:49;37:54;"Like Newfoundland, one of them is in Thunder Bay. Not sure if that one's going to survive."
37:54;38:00;"Another one's in, oh, another one was in Victoria on Vancouver Island. I visited that store"
38:00;38:06;"literally a week before they shut it down to move it to a new location."
38:06;38:10;"So these are ones you had on your list. And now, yeah, who knows if you'll get to see"
38:10;38:11;"them."
38:11;38:12;"The St. John's one is gone."
38:12;38:13;"Oh, it's gone."
38:13;38:17;"Yeah, that's gone. That's one that I'll never get to see. And you know, the same thing happened"
38:17;38:23;"down Mexico way. When I got down to Monterrey, there were a number, at least three, four,"
38:23;38:29;"maybe five that were closed permanently. There's a few, a couple of universities, one in a"
38:29;38:35;"business district that are temporarily closed and might be open if and when I ever return."
38:35;38:42;"But for the most part, that was a highly successful trip. I got to almost, I think almost 60 stores."
38:42;38:43;"Oh my God."
38:43;38:47;"Yeah, only one of them I couldn't go into."
38:47;38:51;"Well, so first of all, you just drove there. You crossed the border."
38:51;38:52;"You can't."
38:52;38:53;"Oh."
38:53;38:55;"This is the thing. The border is closed."
38:55;38:57;"The US Mexico border is closed."
38:57;39:03;"The land border is closed, but Mexico needs the tourist dollars. So they're still allowing"
39:03;39:11;"US citizens to get in by air without a quarantine requirement, without proof of a negative COVID"
39:11;39:15;"test. The only thing that they require is you fill out a questionnaire with the usual"
39:15;39:19;"questions. Have you had any symptoms? Have you had a cough? Have you been in contact"
39:19;39:24;"with anybody with COVID? It generates a QR code that you then present when you get to"
39:24;39:30;"the airport. But even that is lax. I was not asked for my QR code when I got to the airport."
39:30;39:35;"When I flew out, however, they asked me, ""Do you have this form?"" I pulled it out of my"
39:35;39:41;"backpack, but they didn't actually scan the QR code and examine the questions. So it's"
39:41;39:46;"like I suspect it's that way all over the world. Just depends on who you are and who's"
39:46;39:51;"in charge, how serious they enforce the COVID restrictions that are on paper."
39:51;39:57;"Right. Well, so normally when you're Starbucks in the US, you're driving in your car from"
39:57;40:02;"place to place and you often sleep in your car, save money on hotels. What do you do"
40:02;40:04;"when you fly somewhere? Like when you fly to Monterey?"
40:04;40:10;"Well, typically I would stay in a hostel, but another COVID precaution was I didn't"
40:10;40:14;"even look for hostels. I just went ahead and booked a hotel because I didn't want to expose"
40:14;40:20;"myself to more people. Typically I take public transportation. I consider it part of the"
40:20;40:28;"challenge to see how many stores I can get to by bus, walking, train, et cetera. But"
40:28;40:32;"again, because of COVID, it was just safer to rent a car."
40:32;40:35;"And it seemed like, were you hitting some other places when you were in Monterey?"
40:35;40:41;"Yeah, yeah. I think I got three or four different independent cafes. I mean, you're traveling"
40:41;40:44;"all the way down to this foreign country. You don't know when you're going to be back."
40:44;40:48;"You might as well get as much as possible. So yeah, I definitely wanted to see what the"
40:48;40:53;"coffee was like down there and see if I could have any good experiences with Mexican coffees."
40:53;41:00;"Traditionally, I have not enjoyed coffees from Mexico. This was no different. There"
41:00;41:05;"were only a couple of cups that I could say that I really enjoyed. Most of them were mediocre,"
41:05;41:11;"but that's just my preference. From Central America, I prefer with coffees from Colombia."
41:11;41:15;"Peru has some good coffees, also Nicaragua."
41:15;41:19;"But the Starbucks coffee in Monterey, same as anywhere?"
41:19;41:28;"Same as anywhere, although I would say that it was more consistently better brewed than"
41:28;41:34;"a lot of the coffees I've had here in the United States. But they don't always have"
41:34;41:40;"coffee brewed. And in those cases, when I would ask for the coffee of the day, they"
41:40;41:46;"would just give me an Americano without telling me. I think in the United States, they would"
41:46;41:51;"tell you that it's an Americano. They would offer to do a pour over or they would say,"
41:51;41:55;"""Can I pour you an Americano?"" In Mexico, they didn't just tell me. I could just taste"
41:55;41:58;"it. You can taste the difference between an Americano and brewed coffee."
41:58;42:03;"Well, and that seems to be a confusion in most places outside of the US where if you"
42:03;42:09;"order a coffee, you might get an Americano because the American brewed coffee experience"
42:09;42:11;"is kind of specific."
42:11;42:13;"Yes, you are 100% correct."
42:13;42:18;"Although you would think at Starbucks, being a big American corporation, it might be a"
42:18;42:19;"little clearer."
42:19;42:26;"Yeah, but still, if you go to India, for example, when I went to Bangalore, when I went to Mumbai,"
42:26;42:32;"they don't even have the coffee brewing machines. If you actually want brewed coffee, your only"
42:32;42:36;"option is a French press or you can get an Americano."
42:36;42:39;"No brewed coffee at Indian Starbucks."
42:39;42:40;"No brewed coffee."
42:40;42:45;"That honestly sounds like a superior experience because the brewed coffee at Starbucks is"
42:45;42:50;"basically inedible."
42:50;42:51;"You're not wrong."
42:51;42:53;"An Americano is also more expensive."
42:53;42:54;"Yes, yes."
42:54;42:59;"Than a brewed coffee. So I think they think, ""Oh, of course he'd want that. I'm giving"
42:59;43:01;"him a more expensive coffee."""
43:01;43:04;"Not in Mexico. They charged me the same thing."
43:04;43:05;"Geez."
43:05;43:08;"Oh, and it was because of the exchange rate, it was cheaper too. I was only paying about"
43:08;43:14;"a buck fifty. So I ended up spending a lot less on coffee than I had budgeted. I actually"
43:14;43:21;"have a Mexican Starbucks card with me that's almost completely full because I didn't use"
43:21;43:22;"it all up."
43:22;43:23;"Oh, wow."
43:23;43:28;"And then when you mapped out your trip, were you having like lunch and dinner? Were there"
43:28;43:35;"specific like Monterey restaurants that you were trying to make sure you hit? Or this"
43:35;43:40;"trip is about Starbucks, so it's like eat whatever is quick and easy."
43:40;43:45;"Yeah, the trip was about Starbucks with the independent coffee houses thrown in. I did"
43:45;43:51;"want to try and have some actual meals, but I wasn't looking for them. So it's like there"
43:51;43:55;"was one evening where I just stumbled across a restaurant, a little cafe, a hole in the"
43:55;43:59;"wall that was about to close. And I had a dish. I can't remember what it's called, but"
43:59;44:05;"it's typical of Northern Mexico. So that was a good experience. But that was just randomly"
44:05;44:11;"stumbled across that. I did find the, probably saw my pictures of the food cart noshery that"
44:11;44:16;"I stumbled across. I love those. Then of course, I had to have my ramen experience that I try"
44:16;44:17;"to have everywhere I go."
44:17;44:22;"Oh, right. So yeah, I've noticed that ramen, is that archived on the website that all the"
44:22;44:23;"ramen places you hit?"
44:23;44:30;"It is not. I actually have a Google map, like my duck donuts everywhere map and some other"
44:30;44:35;"maps that I keep, but I don't actually have a link to it anywhere. I just, I've got so"
44:35;44:39;"much data, places that I've been to that I don't have it all organized. One of these"
44:39;44:40;"days."
44:40;44:43;"That's actually what I wanted to ask you about next, because I noticed on Instagram, you're"
44:43;44:50;"always talking about hidden duck donuts. And I'm thinking, all right, some little chain"
44:50;44:54;"that winter's into. And then I feel like recently you were posting about how you had just hit"
44:54;45:00;"your hundredth duck donuts. And I was like, what the hell? So how many are there total"
45:00;45:03;"winter? You've hit a hundred. How many duck donuts are there?"
45:03;45:10;"I've been to 105 now. There's roughly 97 or 98, maybe a hundred that have opened. The"
45:10;45:18;"discrepancy is that at least 10, 11, maybe 12 have closed. The pandemic hit them a bit"
45:18;45:24;"hard. I think almost half of the ones that have closed, closed this year. But yeah, I"
45:24;45:31;"just love their, their donuts. You guys are in California. There are two locations out"
45:31;45:36;"there that are still open. The one down in Encinitas closed, but Irvine and I believe"
45:36;45:38;"Huntington beach are still open."
45:38;45:39;"Yeah."
45:39;45:40;"Really?"
45:40;45:46;"And I think that might be the one that's right next to Irvine, right? It's in a yeah, it's"
45:46;45:50;"in a food hall. That's really cool. Have you, I don't know if you've been there, but it's,"
45:50;45:55;"there's this really cool food hall there. That's another thing that I pursue unofficially."
45:55;46:00;"I love the food hall concept. One of the things that I love is they typically don't have a"
46:00;46:07;"lot of chains. They're more local, more independent restaurants as opposed to a shopping mall"
46:07;46:12;"or a retail Plaza. You know, you've seen from my post that I'm big on pushing the Indy and"
46:12;46:13;"the small businesses."
46:13;46:17;"Absolutely. I respect that. But where's duck donuts from?"
46:17;46:22;"Believe it or not, they started in duck, North Carolina."
46:22;46:25;"Oh, I didn't even, I've never heard of that town."
46:25;46:30;"Yeah. It's, it's in the outer banks, you know, now they've expanded to, you know, maybe 10,"
46:30;46:31;"maybe 15 States."
46:31;46:33;"Do you have a go-to donut?"
46:33;46:40;"Yeah. It's just a plain cake donut with powdered sugar. Although after about 50 or 60 of those,"
46:40;46:45;"I said, you know what, I'm going to try every combination. You know, you've probably noticed"
46:45;46:50;"that the way my mind works is like collecting and patterns and organizing things like that."
46:50;46:58;"So they've got coatings, toppings, and drizzles. So I'm basically going through every permutation"
46:58;47:01;"of every coating, topping and drizzle."
47:01;47:03;"Is it like made to order?"
47:03;47:05;"You tell them what you want. Yeah. Yeah. They're not."
47:05;47:09;"Okay. So that's the whole duck donuts concept is we give you exactly what you're looking"
47:09;47:13;"for. Like, and they're made when you order them. So they're come right out of the machine"
47:13;47:20;"and thus the texture of the donut is much different than a donut that's made at two"
47:20;47:23;"or three in the morning, like Dunkin or Shipley's or Krispy Kreme."
47:23;47:24;"Are they warm?"
47:24;47:29;"Oh yeah. When they come out of the machine, absolutely. And they almost melt in your mouth"
47:29;47:30;"almost."
47:30;47:32;"By machine, you mean deep fryer?"
47:32;47:34;"Yes. Yeah. A donut deep fryer."
47:34;47:41;"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time at the Regal. A young man went out and made a name for himself."
47:41;47:50;"He's been on every record breaking show in the Regal theater in the last two years. Ladies"
47:50;47:57;"and gentlemen, it's time. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen."
47:57;48:26;"I want to update you on the latest news from duck donuts. They opened a location in September"
48:26;48:28;"of this year in Dubai."
48:28;48:37;"Yeah, yep. Oh wow. I was actually considering Dubai as a place to go for my 16,000 store."
48:37;48:42;"But I just even even though a lot of people aren't flying and the emissions from air travel"
48:42;48:48;"this year are almost nothing. I still have a hard time justifying flying all the way"
48:48;48:54;"to Dubai and back. I'm really holding off on that Asia Europe trip until I can do the"
48:54;49:00;"entire world again just to minimize carbon footprint. Also, I don't want to be on a flight"
49:00;49:03;"for 12 hours with COVID in the air."
49:03;49:07;"Sounds terrible. Yeah, that's stressful. Maybe next year."
49:07;49:08;"Exactly 2022."
49:08;49:14;"I want to write a song about being at the duck donuts in Dubai. Good alliteration."
49:14;49:21;"You know, that sounds like a mountain bruise song to be honest with you."
49:21;49:29;"Mountain bruise transitions into just like weird late 2000s like rich guy classic rock."
49:29;49:36;"The 10th EP and it's just like Jake is on some like Eric Clapton like really into like"
49:36;49:42;"watches and $70,000 guitars and there's just like a song about just being at the duck donuts"
49:42;49:44;"in Dubai."
49:44;49:48;"And you wash it down with the worst margarita of your life."
49:48;49:54;"Wait, so but winter just don't really understand duck donuts. They don't even have like the"
49:54;49:56;"traditional like trays of donuts in the back."
49:56;49:57;"No, they do not."
49:57;49:59;"Every single one is fresh made to order. Okay."
49:59;50:05;"Yeah, I mean, it's possible that they might make an order and then somebody doesn't come"
50:05;50:11;"and pick it up, right? That would really be the only time that they so what's the wait"
50:11;50:17;"time? Oh my lord. When some of these duck donuts have opened up, they've had lines out"
50:17;50:23;"the door for days because of the wait time. That's one of the reasons. Yeah, no, I'm not"
50:23;50:28;"kidding. Westchester County. I when I went to the one and I don't even know how to pronounce"
50:28;50:33;"it. You can how do you pronounce my maron neck? It's like my maron. Yeah, my maron neck."
50:33;50:38;"When I went to that one, I waited in line for quite a bit and I was asking some guy"
50:38;50:42;"in line behind me if he'd been there before and he said that like for days, they'd had"
50:42;50:45;"lines out the door and and around the corner."
50:45;50:51;"Are there any in Massachusetts? Not yet. No, Connecticut. No, the furthest up to New England."
50:51;50:55;"They get is that one in my maroon is that one in manic. That'll be really fucked up"
50:55;51:00;"when they open their first one in Massachusetts. Just like that'll be really crossing a line"
51:00;51:05;"getting deep into Duncan, Duncan country. And just you picture like a bunch of like"
51:05;51:09;"guys driving a duck donuts in the morning. They see the line at duck donuts is like,"
51:09;51:18;"what the fuck is wrong with you people? You morons. Are you kidding me? You losers. But"
51:18;51:23;"that must be a very different experience. A hot made to your specification donut. I"
51:23;51:27;"couldn't help but think when you talk about the fact that they don't make these at 2am."
51:27;51:32;"I'm thinking back to the Duncan Donuts ad campaign that we've discussed on time crisis"
51:32;51:38;"multiple times. Winter perhaps you remember the famous guy. He was Fred the baker and"
51:38;51:43;"he did. Yeah, yeah. Time to make the donuts. So you could almost imagine a duck donuts"
51:43;51:47;"commercial where they like get some dude dressed up like Fred wakes up. It's like time to make"
51:47;51:52;"the donuts and his wife is like, Oh, you're leaving again. He's like, I gotta make the"
51:52;51:57;"donuts and then just like a giant duck pulls up and they're just like, Fred, quit being"
51:57;52:02;"a martyr. You piece of shit. You never see your family anymore. And you know what? All"
52:02;52:07;"you're doing is creating donuts that are going to be stale by the time people come to buy"
52:07;52:13;"them. You're not working smarter. You're working stupid. You're tired as hell. Probably shortening"
52:13;52:18;"your lifespan. Fred, don't do it. There's nothing cool about waking up early to make"
52:18;52:23;"the donuts. You should make them one by one. The people will appreciate it. Your wife will"
52:23;52:28;"appreciate it. Don't do it. Fred. His entire business model has been upended by duck donuts."
52:28;52:33;"Could be but you know, it remains to be seen how many of these stores that they've opened"
52:33;52:37;"up in the last few years are going to survive. I'm a little alarmed by their closure rate,"
52:37;52:42;"but again, the pandemic has changed everything. So, well, and do you ever roll up to duck"
52:42;52:48;"donuts and there's somebody who maybe not during COVID times, but before when somebody's"
52:48;52:54;"like an intern is rolling down to pick up like a box of 24 for the, you know, breakfast"
52:54;52:58;"at the office, does that suddenly just like make the person behind them have to wait an"
52:58;53:04;"extra like 30 minutes? Absolutely. Yes. I have seen people ordering a dozen or two dozen"
53:04;53:09;"donuts and yes, everybody else just has to wait. That's a problem. Yeah, that's a big"
53:09;53:15;"problem. That's a problem for the business model. That's why I'm not bullish on their"
53:15;53:22;"success. I love the donut. I don't know if the concept can ever reach the level of a"
53:22;53:27;"Dunkin. Wait, and if you had to guess, how long does it take to make one duck donut that"
53:27;53:31;"had some drizzle and some sprinkles, you know, this is a little bulls*** on it. How long"
53:31;53:36;"is that taking? Oh, geez. I'm so bad at noticing things. I would say one to two minutes to"
53:36;53:41;"come out of the machine, but it might be less than one minute. And then depending upon how"
53:41;53:46;"complicated it is, let's say you've got a topping, a coating and a drizzle. I've seen"
53:46;53:51;"that process. That is at least for all three of them, at least two to three minutes box"
53:51;53:56;"it up. Yeah. It could be a good five minutes. Could be. I'm sure that some employees do"
53:56;54:01;"it faster. But you can't make the machine go faster. Honestly, unless they create some"
54:01;54:05;"new tech, they need a new machine. You know what? They need to team up with Elizabeth"
54:05;54:12;"Holmes and get kind of like a Theranos situation in which they create a kind of mini duck donuts"
54:12;54:18;"box that can do the donut much faster and they could have them kiosks at Walgreens and"
54:18;54:24;"things like that. Because otherwise you get in this bottleneck situation where everybody's"
54:24;54:28;"coming to the duck donuts. But if they had a Theranos type machine, you could be like,"
54:28;54:34;"well, there's one at your public library. There's one at the Walgreens. There's a hospital."
54:34;54:41;"There's one hospital. And suddenly everybody's getting their duck donuts with less wait time."
54:41;54:46;"Before I forget, we should talk about the logistics for Bolivia because they're actually"
54:46;54:50;"quite interesting, if you don't mind. Wait, did you go to Bolivia to this year? No, no."
54:50;54:57;"That's where I plan to see my 16,000 store. Oh, OK. If I can get it, you can get there."
54:57;55:02;"OK, so where the breakouts out where there's a lot of moving parts. Yeah. First of all,"
55:02;55:07;"I have to get into Panama. So the airport still has to be open. And actually, two days"
55:07;55:13;"ago, they instituted a curfew from the 25th to the 28th. And then again, from the first"
55:13;55:19;"to like the fourth. Coincidentally enough, I just happen to book my flights for the 29th"
55:19;55:25;"to the first to be in Panama. So I actually get to be there in a window when things are"
55:25;55:31;"open so I can run around buying medicines and other stuff for my mother. But from Panama,"
55:31;55:37;"I have to go to Bolivia and I also need a covid test. Oh, I need a covid test for Panama."
55:37;55:42;"So once I get to the airport for 50 bucks, I'll be able to take a test. I actually have"
55:42;55:49;"to take the test before I clear immigration. The test can't be older than 48 hours. So"
55:49;55:53;"it makes sense just to do it there as opposed to trying to find a place in Miami on Monday"
55:53;55:59;"to do it and turn it around immediately for Bolivia. The test can't be older than seven"
55:59;56:05;"days. So theoretically, that test that I take in Panama should be good for Bolivia. But"
56:05;56:10;"I don't know that for a fact. And I haven't been able to get anybody on the phone. Especially"
56:10;56:15;"it being two different countries. The embassy page that lists all this information for Bolivia"
56:15;56:20;"list a phone number for say this, which is like their Ministry of Health. I tried to"
56:20;56:25;"call them I couldn't get through. I figure my best bet is when I get to the airport in"
56:25;56:31;"Panama, after I've cleared immigration, go over to the Copa counter. Copa is the airline"
56:31;56:38;"that I'm taking to Bolivia and ask them because they're the ones who would be stopping me"
56:38;56:44;"from boarding if I don't have the required test because they don't want me to be stuck"
56:44;56:49;"there or have to bring me back. Then when I come back from Bolivia, I'll have to have"
56:49;56:55;"another test in Panama. So there's just a lot of things that could go wrong. Bolivia"
56:55;57:00;"has lifted all its COVID restrictions through January 15. Fingers crossed that they don't"
57:00;57:05;"impose them. The worst thing would be I get there and all the Starbucks are closed. I've"
57:05;57:10;"already called them to make sure that they're all open from 7am to 10pm because I've got"
57:10;57:16;"one day to see those six stores and I may do it on foot. So that's going to be an interesting"
57:16;57:17;"trip."
57:17;57:20;"And how many Starbucks are you trying to hit in Bolivia?"
57:20;57:22;"Just six. They only have six. There's one."
57:22;57:23;"In the whole country?"
57:23;57:24;"Yeah."
57:24;57:28;"Are the six Starbucks all in with the capital city La Paz?"
57:28;57:33;"The capital city is La Paz. But that's not where the Starbucks are. The Starbucks are"
57:33;57:42;"in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. And they're all, once I arrive late on the first, I can take"
57:42;57:47;"the shuttle over to the hotel. In the morning, I can get a taxi down into the city and I"
57:47;57:54;"should be able to walk all six Starbucks with plenty of time to look for any independent"
57:54;57:58;"coffee. Although I don't know if they have a coffee scene in Bolivia. I know that you"
57:58;58:03;"like indie coffee houses, Ezra. And I think you might be into that too. Have you ever"
58:03;58:07;"seen coffee from Bolivia served at any of the coffee houses in Southern California?"
58:07;58:08;"I never have."
58:08;58:14;"I mean, I'll admit I don't pay as much attention. I would guess that they grow coffee in Bolivia."
58:14;58:18;"I would too, but maybe it's not the quality that gets exported. You know, I mean, the"
58:18;58:25;"same thing used to be true for places like Rwanda, Uganda. You just never saw those coffees"
58:25;58:31;"here in the US. Vietnam, because it just wasn't up to a craft coffee standards. But some of"
58:31;58:37;"those countries have elevated their coffee production mechanisms to the point that some"
58:37;58:41;"of the nicer shops, the artisanal shops, third wave shops here are actually buying those"
58:41;58:44;"coffees. But no idea about Bolivia."
58:44;58:49;"So the capital city doesn't have any Starbucks. You said that these are all in the city. Santa"
58:49;58:50;"Cruz."
58:50;58:52;"Santa Cruz de la Sierra."
58:52;58:57;"Is Santa Cruz de la Sierra like a wealthier, more bourgeois town? Do you have a sense of"
58:57;58:59;"why they have all the Starbucks?"
58:59;59:05;"Not a clue. I'm really organized in certain aspects, but sometimes I'm like literally"
59:05;59:09;"at the airport. I just arrived in a country like getting on the Wi-Fi, looking up the"
59:09;59:14;"Wikipedia page. It's like how do things work in this country? Yeah. So I do not know."
59:14;59:16;"Well, good luck down there."
59:16;59:22;"It should be interesting. Even, you know what, even if I can't get into Bolivia, that's"
59:22;59:27;"fine. It's not the end of the world. I'd probably try to get on a plane back to Miami"
59:27;59:34;"sooner and see if I could hop on a flight to Mexico just so I can do that 16,000 store"
59:34;59:39;"in another country. I just do not want to hit 16,000 in the US because I've done that"
59:39;59:44;"so many times, that milestone so many times. It's kind of boring now."
59:44;59:45;"Maybe hit like Mexico City."
59:45;59:48;"I went to some great coffee shops last time I was in Mexico City."
59:48;59:49;"Yeah, yeah."
59:49;59:50;"Just some nice cafes."
59:50;59:55;"I think I might have seen one of your posts from Mexico. I'd probably go to Guadalajara"
59:55;59:57;"just because I've never been there before."
59:57;59:59;"Oh yeah, Guadalajara's cool too."
59:59;01:00:11;"Well, everyone was inside talking in the cappuccino bar. Had to get outside rocking. Playing on"
01:00:11;01:00:19;"the old guitar. Now you're going to get ready to give me a beat, right? Because I couldn't"
01:00:19;01:00:27;"stay inside talking. Had to get outside rocking. Well, three cappuccinos and a three croissant."
01:00:27;01:00:33;"Jonathan, Jonathan, what do you want? Well, not me. Not me. No, I couldn't sit down no"
01:00:33;01:00:38;"more. Because I couldn't stay inside talking. Well, I had to get outside rocking."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"You've been doing this for 23 years?"
01:00:42;01:00:47;"23 and a half. Yeah. Next summer I'll be celebrating 24. What I'm really looking forward to is"
01:00:47;01:00:52;"my 25th anniversary when I will have been Starbucks-ing for half the time that I've"
01:00:52;01:00:53;"been alive."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"Wow. 25 and 50?"
01:00:56;01:01:01;"Yeah, yeah. I'll turn 50 in the same year that I hit 25 years of Starbucks-ing."
01:01:01;01:01:08;"Amazing. I'm just doing a quick number crunch here. So on average, you're hitting 695 Starbucks"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"a year."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"I guess. Yeah, yeah. Some years more than others."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Holy s***."
01:01:12;01:01:16;"This has been a heavy year just because of what I explained earlier, that I'm able to"
01:01:16;01:01:23;"work and hit the road at the same time. And I was rushing to get to as many stores as"
01:01:23;01:01:31;"possible before they closed. There's still four outstanding stores in the US that I worry"
01:01:31;01:01:36;"about and there's nothing I can do. They just haven't reopened because of COVID and they"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"never might. And there's just nothing I can do about that. There's the one in Canada that"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"I lost."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"Only four? Wow."
01:01:41;01:01:46;"Wait, wait. When you say there's four outstanding stores in the US, you mean there's only four"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"that you haven't been to?"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"No."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Or there's only four that..."
01:01:50;01:01:56;"There's four really old ones. Like Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, one of the relocated"
01:01:56;01:02:01;"ones in downtown Chicago, a San Mateo store that inexplicably didn't do enough business"
01:02:01;01:02:06;"to reopen. It reopened and then shut down again because it was slow. And then there"
01:02:06;01:02:14;"was one in Billings, Montana that was closed because of COVID. When I happened to be there,"
01:02:14;01:02:22;"I waited around to see if the brother of the manager actually contacted him and said, ""Hey,"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"can you help this guy out?"" And he was going to, but then he got busy trying to staff some"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"other stores. And I waited about four hours and that was all I could give."
01:02:29;01:02:34;"So you got four old ones that you haven't hit plus 8,000 new ones?"
01:02:34;01:02:40;"In the US, over a hundred. It was when I made my last post saying, ""Look at this map. Can"
01:02:40;01:02:45;"you believe this?"" It was under a hundred. Since I made that post, about a dozen new"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"stores have opened up. So that's now over a hundred."
01:02:48;01:02:52;"You're only like 114 down in the US."
01:02:52;01:02:59;"Now, but that'll double or triple because once I get back from my 16,000 trip, that"
01:02:59;01:03:06;"was the big push. There was really no advantage to being on the road constantly trying to"
01:03:06;01:03:13;"keep up. It's not a good use of my time. I would rather focus on trying to get more of"
01:03:13;01:03:20;"my book out. If I could plug for the Time Crisis listeners who haven't seen my post"
01:03:20;01:03:24;"yet, I've got another chapter of my book on my website."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"Yeah, I was checking that out."
01:03:25;01:03:32;"That's more of them up there. And I hope that I can write faster in 2021 because I won't"
01:03:32;01:03:36;"be bouncing all over the country trying to hit as many Starbucks as possible. I mean,"
01:03:36;01:03:41;"I feel kind of bad. I've written four chapters in nine months. Kazzy David got a whole book"
01:03:41;01:03:44;"out. Taylor Swift got two albums out."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"True."
01:03:45;01:03:48;"I feel like I've been slacking."
01:03:48;01:03:52;"They don't even have close to the responsibilities that you have with Starbucks."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"They're not hitting 700 Starbucks a year, dude."
01:03:55;01:04:02;"Hey, Winter. Have you ever considered virtual Starbucks? Just the nature of the times you"
01:04:02;01:04:08;"could really scale yourself if you had a surrogate out there at various Starbucks holding up"
01:04:08;01:04:13;"a laptop going in. And I don't think anybody would really fault you for taking a virtual"
01:04:13;01:04:17;"approach and you could really maximize your Starbucks."
01:04:17;01:04:26;"I have considered like, is there some way within the spirit of Starbucks that somebody"
01:04:26;01:04:34;"could visit a store and then transfer it to me? Like, I don't know, like we, we cut our"
01:04:34;01:04:40;"hands and shake hands and exchange blood. And by that way, the coffee magically transfers"
01:04:40;01:04:43;"over to me. Something like that."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"You have to deputize somebody. Wait, Winter, I have an idea. I wonder if you'll find this"
01:04:46;01:04:51;"appealing as somebody who, you know, you like to make rules and stuff. We know that"
01:04:51;01:04:55;"Winter was not your birth name, but it is your legal name."
01:04:55;01:05:00;"What if you deputize somebody else, but they have to legally change their name to Winter"
01:05:00;01:05:07;"or Winter 2? I think that way it's not just like, oh, I got a guy off Craigslist who said"
01:05:07;01:05:12;"for 10 bucks, he'd walk to the Starbucks and go. It's somebody who's so committed to the"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"project that they become Winter 2."
01:05:14;01:05:19;"It's not a bad idea. And to be honest, quite a number of people have emailed me and said,"
01:05:19;01:05:24;"Hey, you need this store. I'll take, go take a picture for you. But you know, I think by"
01:05:24;01:05:29;"now you all know me well enough to know that there's a certain artistic integrity to the"
01:05:29;01:05:36;"project that can't be violated. In fact, the next chapter that I will probably write will"
01:05:36;01:05:43;"be a lighter one, just going over the rules of Starbucks. So, you know, people will understand"
01:05:43;01:05:48;"why it has to be me going in and why I have to drink the coffee and this detail or that"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"detail."
01:05:49;01:05:53;"That's going to be important for the whole community too, because I think so many people"
01:05:53;01:05:57;"are curious about Starbucks and interested in your story and following it. And probably"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"some of them, you know, you've talked about people who were inspired by you to do it themselves,"
01:06:01;01:06:09;"but I think having a clear cut set of rules from the OG will really be important for like"
01:06:09;01:06:10;"building the movement."
01:06:10;01:06:18;"Well, yes. Or for understanding the movement, but I do not want people to feel that the"
01:06:18;01:06:23;"rules that I am following are the rules that they're following. I think that at some point"
01:06:23;01:06:31;"you should try to get Sebastian on the show because he is the second most prolific Starbucker"
01:06:31;01:06:37;"with over 3,000 stores under his belt. He's the German kid. He follows different rules."
01:06:37;01:06:42;"He goes to the licensed stores, the franchise stores. He doesn't require himself to drink"
01:06:42;01:06:47;"a coffee from each one, but he does require that the store be open so he can go inside."
01:06:47;01:06:51;"So sometimes he's gotten to the store, it's been closed. He doesn't count it. He has to"
01:06:51;01:06:56;"go back later. If I have to give the fans like one heuristic for how to do your own"
01:06:56;01:07:02;"Starbucking is come up with rules that are not too simple, so it'll still be a challenge,"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"and stick to those rules."
01:07:04;01:07:10;"You're very diplomatic, Winter, but just so everybody knows, on Time Crisis, we do only"
01:07:10;01:07:15;"recognize Starbucking as a person who adheres to the Winter set of rules. And again, you"
01:07:15;01:07:19;"know, you say what you want, Winter, that's fine, but just here at Time Crisis, we do"
01:07:19;01:07:25;"not designate somebody a Starbucker unless they adhere to the Winter set of rules. We"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"as a news organization just have to draw the line somewhere."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"You're the boss. You're the boss."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"I'm sure you understand."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"I understand."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"Great to see you, Winter. Have a great trip to Bolivia. I hope it all works out and you"
01:07:35;01:07:39;"get to hit those six and we'll catch you in 2021."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"All right. Well, 2021, will you still think about me?"
01:07:43;01:07:47;"Oh, you know we'll be thinking about you."
01:07:47;01:07:52;"All right, have a good one, man. Take care."
01:07:52;01:07:59;"2021, will you think about me? I could wait a year, but I shouldn't wait three."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"Boy."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"I don't want to be."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Boy."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"Mm-mm-mm-mm."
01:08:04;01:08:11;"2021, will you think about us? Copper goes green, steel beams go rust."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"Boy."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"It's a matter of."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"Boy."
01:08:16;01:08:21;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:08:21;01:08:27;"Friend of the show, Winter. Absolute legend. Really hope things work out in Bolivia."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"So, Jake, had you ever heard of Duck Donuts before?"
01:08:30;01:08:34;"No, new to me. Smaller chain, under 100 locations."
01:08:34;01:08:37;"That's still like a wild amount of locations."
01:08:37;01:08:42;"Once you get to 100, I feel like you're killing it. That's like a lot to manage."
01:08:42;01:08:46;"Yeah, I was thinking about that, like them expanding in the Southern California and like"
01:08:46;01:08:51;"they have this pretty like high standards of quality that they need to maintain."
01:08:51;01:08:58;"Like, how do you just like expand into a new region and like find the right people that you can like trust?"
01:08:58;01:09:02;"Like, okay, I'm hiring you as the store manager for the Santa Ana location."
01:09:02;01:09:06;"And like, I'm going to train you, but I don't really know you."
01:09:06;01:09:09;"Like, are you, is this, are we good here? Like, can you handle this?"
01:09:09;01:09:15;"No, I think that's that **** where it's like, probably it's a lot of, you know, North Carolina transplants."
01:09:15;01:09:20;"You don't just set it up. It's just like, all right, Buck, you're moving to SoCal."
01:09:20;01:09:24;"Like, maybe you could come back in five years, but like you have a mission."
01:09:24;01:09:28;"You're the Southern California station chief and you're going to run our operations there."
01:09:28;01:09:32;"And we have very specific objectives. Get it done, man."
01:09:32;01:09:37;"Well, let's keep things moving. Let's get other friend of the show, Rashida Jones,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"for her 10th appearance on the program."
01:09:40;01:09:45;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:09:45;01:09:51;"Rashida Jones, welcome back to the program for your 10th appearance."
01:09:51;01:09:57;"Thank you for having me. Yeah. What a, what a landmark moment for all of us, really."
01:09:57;01:10:00;"We're in different parts of the house."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"I was wondering about that."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"Well, yeah, because what else are we going to do? Like share earbuds?"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"We've done that too, by the way."
01:10:07;01:10:11;"Oh, yeah. Well, I guess actually, Jake, when you had Hannah on, you guys were just hanging."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"Yeah, did you guys pick separate rooms?"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Wait, but Jake, you don't use headphones anymore, huh?"
01:10:14;01:10:17;"No, I'm just, I'm just screaming into a laptop."
01:10:17;01:10:22;"Well, you and the rest of the world."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"Yeah, I think it's good this way."
01:10:24;01:10:28;"First question, Rashida, have you ever heard of Duck Donuts?"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"Duck Donuts? Is it a donut?"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"It's a donut chain, roughly 100 locations in the U.S."
01:10:34;01:10:38;"What? What? Is it like a regional heavy or something?"
01:10:38;01:10:44;"It's from North Carolina, but there's a couple in Southern California because we just had winter on, you know, the Starbucks."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Yeah, yeah."
01:10:46;01:10:51;"And so he's also really into Duck Donuts. So he's been to basically every single one."
01:10:51;01:10:54;"I guess their whole thing is that they make the donut on demand."
01:10:54;01:10:59;"So you like say what drizzle you want on it and it comes out piping hot."
01:10:59;01:11:04;"Oh, that sounds incredible. He's going to have to start star ducking."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Oh, I should have thought of that."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"I mean, that's what I'm here for."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"He basically is star ducking."
01:11:10;01:11:13;"Well, anyway, I had a thought before you came on."
01:11:13;01:11:18;"Seinfeld was saying if you should get a special prize for your 10th appearance on the program."
01:11:18;01:11:28;"And my idea is that Jake picks me up in his minivan and we rip down Huntington Beach and bring back."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"This sounds like your prize so far."
01:11:30;01:11:34;"Me and Jake rip down in the minivan."
01:11:34;01:11:38;"Wait, where did he say? Is the Huntington Beach the closest one? Where's the other one?"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"He said Irvine."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"Irvine, all OC."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"Maybe Irvine is cooler."
01:11:43;01:11:49;"Me and Jake get in the van, rip down to Irvine and bring back a piping hot duck donut."
01:11:49;01:11:52;"Any style that you want. We'll get one for Hannah too."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"How many is a baker's dozen?"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"13."
01:11:55;01:12:01;"Oh, 13. Okay. So it should be like a Rashida dozen. It should just be 10 for every appearance."
01:12:01;01:12:09;"Yeah. Although we asked Winner that apparently if you want to get like a big batch for like, you know, the office breakfast or something."
01:12:09;01:12:12;"Basically, they have to still make them one at a time."
01:12:12;01:12:17;"All right. Me and Jake are going to rip back to LA with 10."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"You can have two. Hannah can have two."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"As the sun goes down."
01:12:21;01:12:24;"Yeah. Just an all day star ducking trip."
01:12:24;01:12:28;"This is like a very romantic Jack Kerouac road trip."
01:12:28;01:12:33;"But we get the hot donuts. By the time we get back to LA."
01:12:33;01:12:41;"That's what I was going to say. This is a bum deal because there's no way, there's no universe in which you two don't get your own donuts."
01:12:41;01:12:46;"And just by the sheer fact that you're going to be there, you're getting the best, freshest vibe."
01:12:46;01:12:52;"Well, hold on. Jake, when you worked at Papa John's, what was the tech like for keeping the pizzas hot?"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"Yeah, there's like a thermal bag."
01:12:56;01:13:01;"Oh, I'll lace you with a thermal bag and then I'll get you a pizza bag."
01:13:01;01:13:04;"Yeah, we'll stick the ducks in there."
01:13:04;01:13:08;"I bet there's even like high end ones where you can plug into the cigarette lighter."
01:13:08;01:13:11;"Oh, that's a great Christmas present."
01:13:11;01:13:16;"If you can source that. I would love that because I have that for like a coffee cup."
01:13:16;01:13:19;"You plug it in the lighter. So cool."
01:13:19;01:13:20;"Oh, really? Yeah. Really?"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"And it keeps the coffee hot?"
01:13:22;01:13:28;"I'm really not trying to brag, but I did get it at the East Wing gift shop at the White House like a decade ago."
01:13:28;01:13:32;"Oh, that time when you were visiting Donald and Melania."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"[Laughter]"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"Ten years ago?"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"No, that was two years ago."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"I laughed too hard."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"It was two years ago. You don't have to cover up."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"To your friends Donald and Melania?"
01:13:44;01:13:49;"Well, first things first, you got new film out there, On the Rocks."
01:13:49;01:13:57;"It's going to be very difficult for me to ask any questions about it because I've been watching you do press for a few months."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"Cool. All right. Nice to see you, John."
01:13:59;01:14:00;"I'll say that..."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Interview's over."
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Yeah, maybe Jake should take over."
01:14:03;01:14:15;"Hannah and I drove out to the drive-in movie theater in City of Industry, California and watched On the Rocks at a drive-in with probably like 50 other cars."
01:14:15;01:14:21;"It was pretty packed. People were psyched to see it. We had a great time at the movies that night."
01:14:21;01:14:22;"That's awesome."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"It was a really fun movie. Now I feel like I'm on the spot. I don't have any cool questions."
01:14:26;01:14:30;"Well, the actual premiere was also at a drive-in. I don't know if you know that."
01:14:30;01:14:31;"Where was that?"
01:14:31;01:14:38;"In New York at the, what is it, the Queen's Science Hall? Is that what it's called? Hall of Science?"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"Yeah, that sounds right."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"That's right."
01:14:41;01:14:42;"The World's Fair."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"Was it pretty strict? Everyone stayed in their cars?"
01:14:44;01:14:50;"It was very strict, yeah. We were allowed to get out and talk to the organizer with masks."
01:14:50;01:14:55;"And then we had to get back into our cars and everybody had to stay in their cars."
01:14:55;01:15:00;"But you know what I really liked about that? I've never been to a drive-in. I know that's crazy, but I've never been to a drive-in."
01:15:00;01:15:07;"I like that people, because you can't applaud. So I like honking as a substitute for applause. I thought that was so cool."
01:15:07;01:15:13;"Then you're just like waving to Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray in their cars?"
01:15:13;01:15:18;"Oh, we actually, we were all in the same car. We got tested and we came together."
01:15:18;01:15:22;"Sofia and her husband and me and Bill were in one car."
01:15:22;01:15:30;"Which was fun because Bill hadn't really seen the movie and Sofia and I were just gabbing and he very much wanted us to be quiet because he really wanted to watch it."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"Oh, wow."
01:15:32;01:15:37;"Right, because Sofia had seen it a million times. He'd probably seen it four or five times."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Yeah."
01:15:38;01:15:41;"That's wild that you were watching with him for the first time."
01:15:41;01:15:50;"I thought it looked great. I thought you were both really great. I love the whole vibe between you two in these fancy Soho places."
01:15:50;01:15:53;"It made me miss being like, ""Oh, damn."""
01:15:53;01:15:54;"I know."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Going out to a restaurant in New York."
01:15:56;01:16:03;"I know. It was kind of an unintentional ""oh, bit"" for whatever version of New York that was."
01:16:03;01:16:06;"Where it will be, will be slightly different."
01:16:06;01:16:15;"Yeah, you were just saying the other day how one of the classic New York restaurants that you guys go to in the movie, the 21 Club, just announced its closing, which is crazy."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"Yeah, it's crazy."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"Been there forever."
01:16:18;01:16:29;"It's the restaurant where we go. We were sitting at Bogart and Bacall's table. I don't know if that made it in the movie, but he tells me a story about how, I think he proposed or something there."
01:16:29;01:16:33;"Anyway, it's a real historic place. Yeah, just gone."
01:16:33;01:16:36;"Well, everybody should see On the Rock's great movie."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Sofia Coppola directed it."
01:16:37;01:16:38;"Streaming?"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"Yeah, it's streaming on Apple."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"Yeah."
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Real Apple household."
01:16:42;01:16:45;"I have a question about Bill Murray. Had you met him before?"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"Yes. We're friends."
01:16:47;01:16:57;"Okay, because I think of him, he's so many iconic roles over the years. I wouldn't be able to help myself asking about Ghostbusters."
01:16:57;01:17:01;"In a situation like that, do you have that urge?"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"Of course I do, yeah."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"Do you not do it?"
01:17:04;01:17:08;"No, I don't do it because I was trying to play cool."
01:17:08;01:17:17;"Also, we spent so much time together that he will just volunteer stories and that's the best way to get those stories anyway."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Right."
01:17:19;01:17:26;"And then you'll get stories that you didn't even ask for. Things you didn't think all of a sudden you care."
01:17:26;01:17:36;"He told me this story about how he became Garfield, which I didn't know. But I guess some people know the story already."
01:17:36;01:17:43;"He was sent this offer to play the voice of Garfield and was told that Joel Cohen was the director."
01:17:43;01:17:47;"And he was like, ""Yeah, Coen Brothers Garfield? Yes."""
01:17:47;01:17:57;"And showed up to the studio that day and met Joel Cohen, the director of Garfield, not Joel Cohen without an H."
01:17:57;01:18:01;"And he has long hair, so I guess we're just gonna do it."
01:18:01;01:18:04;"He just felt too awkward at that point."
01:18:04;01:18:13;"So he thought he was in a Coen Brothers movie and then never talked to them before showing up to..."
01:18:13;01:18:23;"That's very him. He did an episode of Angie Trebekka and after he said yes, it was very touch and go about whether or not he was gonna show up."
01:18:23;01:18:31;"And he called me and told me what JetBlue flight he wanted to be on and then was like, ""Somebody will come get me."""
01:18:31;01:18:37;"And we're like, ""Yeah, you."" But it was not until the day before that I really thought that he was gonna show up."
01:18:37;01:18:39;"He's infamously..."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"He doesn't have a phone?"
01:18:41;01:18:45;"He has a phone, but he doesn't really answer that much."
01:18:45;01:18:51;"When I first met Sophia, I met Sophia, I was in an acting workshop and she was workshopping Lost in Translation."
01:18:51;01:18:56;"And I was playing the Scarlett Johansson part and another actor's playing the Bill part."
01:18:56;01:18:59;"We were like working on it all day long for like a month."
01:18:59;01:19:06;"And there was a dedicated intern who was hired to sit outside our sessions and wait for Bill to call."
01:19:06;01:19:11;"She had the phone in their hand waiting for him to call."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Wow."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"If they missed it, that was that."
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Yeah."
01:19:15;01:19:25;"Considering all the Garfield talk lately with Garfield Eats, the restaurant that recently closed in Toronto, have you ever seen the Bill Murray Garfield movie?"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"No, I haven't. But I should because I'm a huge Garfield fan."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"And a Bill Murray fan. All right, let's watch that tonight."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"All right."
01:19:33;01:19:38;"I'm going to propose for your 10th episode party is we're going to watch the Garfield movie."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"You guys are wilding out."
01:19:40;01:19:41;"Getting real wild."
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Deep into quarantine."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Maybe it's time to get into some music talk."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Totally."
01:19:46;01:19:55;"Just because I wasn't totally sure we were going to talk about, throw out some ideas to you Rashida, one of which was you should listen to Europe 72."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Did you listen to it?"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"I listened to some of it, yeah."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"How far did you get?"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"I got to what's my song?"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"That's my favorite Grateful Dead song."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Oh, China Cat Sunflower."
01:20:05;01:20:07;"No, no, no."
01:20:07;01:20:09;"Ezra's right."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Wait, what's it called?"
01:20:11;01:20:12;"China Cat Sunflower."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Yeah."
01:20:14;01:20:17;"And it was like, that's when I was like, oh, my jam."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"And like, oh, it actually is my jam."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"So I probably didn't get very far."
01:20:20;01:20:21;"Right."
01:20:21;01:20:24;"That's like maybe six songs in or something."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Yeah."
01:20:25;01:20:30;"Oh, but that's cool because actually, I'm sure we've had many versions of this conversation in person."
01:20:30;01:20:35;"But I did kind of want to remember, like, what is your relationship to the Grateful Dead?"
01:20:35;01:20:40;"Every guest, every guest on this show."
01:20:40;01:20:43;"I know the Grateful Dead."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"I know Tom Cruise."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"I know Rashida."
01:20:45;01:20:48;"I know there's not a ton of Rashida Dead content out there."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"So let's set the record straight."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"You're right."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"This is an exclusive."
01:20:53;01:21:06;"I remember my first, you're going to think this is crazy, but my first exposure, because as you know very well, I was raised on R&B and jazz and hip hop and like, you know, a little bit of Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers."
01:21:06;01:21:10;"That hit that they had, that had a video."
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Oh, Touch of Grey."
01:21:11;01:21:12;"Touch of Grey."
01:21:12;01:21:16;"That was the first time I, like, I was like, oh, I know that they're like a band."
01:21:16;01:21:17;"It was like really big."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Not in this era."
01:21:19;01:21:25;"I don't understand what's happening, but I like the song is catchy and I remember some of the H1 a lot."
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Sure."
01:21:26;01:21:27;"Great song."
01:21:28;01:21:34;"And by the way, there's some phases that Ezra goes through where I'm like, I can't wait for this to be over."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"His love of the dead."
01:21:36;01:21:37;"We'll get into that."
01:21:37;01:21:46;"But I'm very, very supportive because it is dynamic and the musicianship is very good and the live performances are really good."
01:21:46;01:21:50;"And I, Jerry's just like, he's very soulful."
01:21:50;01:21:59;"He's a very soulful person, even if his voice is, he's not like, you know, he's not an opera singer, but he just brings like meaning and honesty in the way that he sings."
01:21:59;01:22:02;"So I'm always down to watch him."
01:22:02;01:22:09;"I also say, because you might not remember, but I've noticed that you've always flagged China Cat Sunflower as your favorite."
01:22:09;01:22:18;"I'm pretty sure your other favorite, because I've just noticed you ask a lot, like if you're listening to an instrumental version of it, like you perk up a little bit or you like, wait, is this the dead?"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"You always say that about Eyes of the World."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Do you remember that one?"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"It's kind of like, throw on Eyes of the World."
01:22:24;01:22:27;"Jake, how many times has Richard Pictures played?"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"17."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Really?"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"No, just making that up."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"But yeah, it's a classic."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"Yeah, I like the song."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"Yeah, this is a jam."
01:22:46;01:22:51;"It's such a unique song, like very little truly sounds like it, even within the dead catalog."
01:22:55;01:22:59;"First time in the media, Rashida Jones, top two."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Grateful Dead song."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"This could be a headline, you guys."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"People are dying for this content."
01:23:05;01:23:11;"Look, if any of our friends at Relic are listening to this, because we got some press when we were on recently."
01:23:11;01:23:17;"That made some of the jam band outlets, you know, maybe just like a little thing."
01:23:25;01:23:29;"Well, maybe we should just get into the main event, because I think we got a pretty fun one planned."
01:23:29;01:23:33;"And actually, Rashida, we changed the concept a little bit from when I first pitched it to you."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"Not to put you two on the spot."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"But basically this."
01:23:36;01:23:43;"So you've been on the show before talking about that you were raised and always been a big fan,"
01:23:43;01:23:48;"especially in your teen years of R&B, 90s R&B and hip hop, especially."
01:23:48;01:23:52;"Now, you and Jake are both Gen X."
01:23:52;01:23:58;"In fact, I was thinking about it where I'm like, man, you know, Rashida's Gen X, Jake is Gen X."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Actually Ariel Rekshide, producer is Gen X."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"I was like, you know, I really f*ck with Gen X."
01:24:04;01:24:09;"Even though I'm a silverback millennial."
01:24:09;01:24:17;"But anyway, so often when we do the top five, we'll compare top five songs from now and back then."
01:24:17;01:24:24;"So we were going to maybe do, in honor of you, we were going to do the 1992 Billboard Hot R&B/hip hop songs chart."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"And compare it to 2020."
01:24:26;01:24:33;"And then I started thinking, I'm going to be moderating, you know, two iconic Gen Xers in my own life."
01:24:33;01:24:37;"One who loves R&B and one who loves rock."
01:24:37;01:24:45;"So I thought this is actually a perfect opportunity for us to compare and contrast the top five hot R&B/hip hop songs."
01:24:45;01:24:49;"Because back then there wasn't just an R&B chart, by the way, it was called the R&B/hip hop."
01:24:49;01:24:56;"With the 1992, same week, Billboard Modern Rock tracks."
01:24:56;01:25:00;"So basically, we're having a Rekshide vs. Jake."
01:25:00;01:25:05;"Or it doesn't have to be competitive. It's just the Gen X Town Hall, 1992."
01:25:05;01:25:08;"I know we should do. We should make it competitive."
01:25:08;01:25:16;"And we should see how many Jake get of the top five and how many I can get of the top five of our own genres."
01:25:16;01:25:20;"How quickly you can recognize it."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Yeah, like a name that tune."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Okay, so we won't announce it."
01:25:24;01:25:29;"Right, we won't announce it, but I'm going to do like a cut off at like 30 seconds."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"If you can't get it by that, then we're good."
01:25:31;01:25:34;"If we can't get it by 30 seconds, we shouldn't be considered Gen X."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"Well, okay, let's see. Let's see."
01:25:36;01:25:41;"Just remember, this is the top five of this random week, December 1992."
01:25:41;01:25:44;"This is not the top five hits of the year or anything like that."
01:25:44;01:25:49;"But Jake and I were definitely listening to the radio a lot in '92, right?"
01:25:49;01:25:53;"I was like on the radio like all the time."
01:25:53;01:25:59;"1992, and also just to really paint a picture for everybody, 1992, Rekshide, you're 16."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"Wearing a mustard Gap hoodie."
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Living in Los Angeles."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Yep."
01:26:04;01:26:06;"Jake, you're 15."
01:26:06;01:26:07;"Yep."
01:26:07;01:26:09;"In Connecticut."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Wearing an LL Bean Polar Fleece."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"All right. The scene has been set."
01:26:15;01:26:20;"This is like some Freaky Friday shit. Yeah, okay."
01:26:20;01:26:22;"The scene has officially been set."
01:26:22;01:26:29;"It's time for the Top Five on iTunes."
01:26:29;01:26:35;"So this is the number five song on the R&B/Hip Hop charts this week in '92."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"Let's kick it off."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"Stop, stop. I got it. Portrait. Here we go again."
01:26:41;01:26:44;"That is correct. Portrait, here we go again."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Wait, the artist is named Portrait?"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Yeah. I've seen them live."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"Really?"
01:26:50;01:26:55;"So Portrait's like, it's a group."
01:26:55;01:27:01;"Here we go. Here we go again."
01:27:01;01:27:03;"I like the long intro."
01:27:03;01:27:06;"Very long."
01:27:06;01:27:08;"The chords are great on this song."
01:27:08;01:27:17;"Yeah, it's kind of familiar."
01:27:17;01:27:19;"Where did you see Portrait play?"
01:27:19;01:27:23;"I actually saw them play at like a throwback party."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"Like what year?"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"Like 10 years ago."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"I see."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"Yeah."
01:27:29;01:27:32;"That's a pretty cool name for a band, Portrait."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"Yeah, Portrait could easily be an indie rock band too."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"Or like a weird 70s like psych band."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Oh yeah."
01:27:39;01:27:42;"Yeah, like In A Frame."
01:27:42;01:27:45;"Oh yeah, you can picture the cover."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"Yeah, this is very classic."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"I don't think I know this song."
01:27:48;01:27:53;"For anybody who liked R&B in the 90s, you know this song."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"You just know it."
01:27:54;01:27:57;"And Portrait had other hits? They were like a big group?"
01:27:57;01:27:58;"No."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"This is the one."
01:27:59;01:28:04;"Yeah. I really liked this song. I think I might have had a good single."
01:28:04;01:28:10;"I'm trying to think. Like 1992, I was definitely watching a lot of MTV,"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"but I don't know what my radio diet was like."
01:28:13;01:28:19;"I feel like it was probably like honestly like the oldies station and like the classic rock station."
01:28:19;01:28:22;"And I don't know if I was listening to like…"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"He's making excuses already."
01:28:24;01:28:30;"That's the big one. If you weren't driving to school, then it's going to be hard."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"I wasn't even in cars that much, to be honest."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"I was taking the school bus to and from school."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"Right."
01:28:37;01:28:41;"Then maybe like my mom would drive me to like, I don't know, my buddy's house."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"Or I'd go to the grocery store with my mom. It's like a five minute drive."
01:28:44;01:28:49;"I really… I bet my car time in '92 was pretty limited."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"And therefore my radio time was pretty limited."
01:28:51;01:28:55;"I have faith in you because I just feel like you know a lot of music."
01:28:55;01:28:58;"The only place where you might have caught it, Jake, I'm looking at the notes,"
01:28:58;01:29:02;"is it says that Portrait performed this song on an episode of Family Matters."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"I did watch that show."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Oh my God, really?"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"Yeah."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"I did not know that."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"So Jake, you can't look at the notes, by the way."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"I'm not looking at the notes. I'm doing full screen FaceTime."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"Okay, great. So this is… I'm curious about this."
01:29:15;01:29:19;"All right. The number five song on the Modern Rock chart this week in '92."
01:29:19;01:29:25;"Okay. Yeah, I got it."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"Really? What is it?"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"I know the artist. It's R.E.M."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"Okay."
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Oh, it's Ignore Land."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Whoa, okay."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Wow. Wow."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"Like, definitely don't know this song at all."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Never heard it."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"It's not a big R.E.M. song."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"I didn't know it was a single."
01:29:43;01:29:46;"I know the song because I love this record."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"It's Automatic for the People."
01:29:47;01:29:48;"Right. Yeah."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Automatic for the People."
01:29:49;01:29:53;"Well, yeah. I feel like an album, but I didn't go deep on it."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Wait, Ezra, what chart is this relating to?"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"This is the Modern Rock chart."
01:29:57;01:30:00;"That's not a chart they have anymore, right?"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Maybe this was a late single."
01:30:02;01:30:09;"What I was going to say was, I think in my town where I grew up in '94,"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"I want to say '94, which I was driving by that point,"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"there was an alt-rock station, syndicated, of course,"
01:30:15;01:30:20;"part of a big corporation that started in Connecticut."
01:30:20;01:30:21;"Wow."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"That changed the radio landscape."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Right."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"'92 was a very weird pocket for me."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"So it's like--"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"You're a junior?"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"Were you a junior, sophomore?"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Probably a sophomore."
01:30:31;01:30:33;"Yeah, I graduated in '95."
01:30:33;01:30:39;"So I think my peak familiarity with R&B and hip-hop radio"
01:30:39;01:30:42;"would be like late '90s, early 2000s."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"That would be like my peak of familiarity."
01:30:44;01:30:47;"Wait, Richie, did you say that you owned Automatic for the People?"

01:40:29;01:40:34;"So like, when you were like 16, were you going to like clubs"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"in LA in like '92?"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Like what--"
01:40:37;01:40:39;"There was a big thing."
01:40:39;01:40:41;"There were like teen clubs in LA."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"And they were all-- they all kind of kicked off."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"There was this one club, Ezra and I have talked about,"
01:40:45;01:40:50;"it's called Alfie's Soda Pub, that was like for industry kids."
01:40:50;01:40:53;"They would ask for your resume to like get in the door"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"kind of thing."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"That was in the '80s, like the mid to late '80s."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"And then from that sprung all these other clubs."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"Like David Thread had a club called Ballistic."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"That was like an underage club."
01:41:04;01:41:07;"So like there's no drinks, but it's like everything else"
01:41:07;01:41:10;"is the same, and people got wasted."
01:41:10;01:41:13;"And it looked and felt just like clubs,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"but it was like filled with kids."
01:41:15;01:41:18;"I just got to say real quick about ""Rump Shaker."""
01:41:18;01:41:23;"It says that, you know, like-- because Teddy Riley was like"
01:41:23;01:41:27;"a Virginia Beach guy, and Pharrell was one of his protégés."
01:41:27;01:41:30;"And this is one of the first songs that Pharrell ever worked on."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"And I guess he didn't actually help with the production,"
01:41:33;01:41:37;"but he came up with ""All I Want to Do is Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"and a Boom, Boom."""
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Whoa."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"He was probably like-- how old is Pharrell?"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"He must have been like--"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"Young."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Like a kid, yeah."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"Yeah, like a teenager?"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"I bet Pharrell's like our age, Rashida."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Maybe 20."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"He's older."
01:41:50;01:41:51;"Is he?"
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Yeah."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"All right, so maybe he was like 20, but real early."
01:41:54;01:41:55;"How old is he, like 48, you think?"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"Around there."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"OK."
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Yeah, looks 20."
01:41:58;01:42:00;"Yeah, seriously."
01:42:00;01:42:03;"All right, let's get back to the ""Modern Rock"" chart."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"OK, this one's interesting, because this is an artist"
01:42:05;01:42:08;"I don't really associate with rock."
01:42:08;01:42:10;"I wonder-- this is interesting."
01:42:10;01:42:13;"All right, number three on the ""Modern Rock"" chart."
01:42:35;01:42:36;"""War Times Through."""
01:42:36;01:42:46;"Sounds like Michael Stipe again."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"It is Stipe, but he's not the artist on this."
01:42:48;01:42:53;"Is it a duet?"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"I guess so."
01:42:55;01:42:56;"Is it a band?"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"No, it's--"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"Is it a band name that you knew?"
01:42:59;01:43:02;"It's a solo artist who I know from another song."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Oh, like the guitarist?"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"It's the-- oh."
01:43:04;01:43:05;"It's the other vocalist."
01:43:05;01:43:18;"This sounds like a demo."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"I'm not trying to be a jerk."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"No, for real."
01:43:20;01:43:26;"Oh, is that Nana Cherry?"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"Yes, it's Nana Cherry."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"Nice."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"I don't know this song, though."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"I know ""Buffalo""--"
01:43:31;01:43:32;"I don't know this song at all."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Wait, did you recognize her voice?"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"Yeah."
01:43:35;01:43:39;"I loved her single from the late '80s, ""Buffalo Dance."""
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Yeah, ""Buffalo Dance,"" right."
01:43:41;01:43:42;"(SINGING) No money, man."
01:43:42;01:43:43;"So good."
01:43:43;01:43:47;"So did she go in like kind of an earthy, kind of Ani DiFranco"
01:43:47;01:43:48;"direction?"
01:43:48;01:43:51;"Ooh."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"Yikes."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"So I guess that's like--"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"The key is showing up."
01:43:55;01:43:58;"--a recreation of John Bonham."
01:43:58;01:44:01;"I mean, this almost could be like an early Beck song."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"You know what I mean?"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"This has like a Beck vibe."
01:44:04;01:44:07;"This song is called ""Trout,"" by the way."
01:44:07;01:44:08;"""Trout""?"
01:44:08;01:44:09;"Yeah."
01:44:09;01:44:11;"This feels very much categorically"
01:44:11;01:44:14;"like when an artist--"
01:44:14;01:44:17;"people just like an artist, so anything they put out"
01:44:17;01:44:19;"just makes it on the chart."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"You know what I mean?"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"Like Michael Stipe was probably so big."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"Oh, sure."
01:44:23;01:44:27;"Yeah, maybe it's more Stipe than Nana Cherry."
01:44:27;01:44:28;"She certainly wasn't--"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"I feel like this dance is like '89 or something."
01:44:30;01:44:31;"Yeah, '88, '89."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"Yes, it's not that long-- much longer."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"But also, but Nana Cherry didn't have much of a presence"
01:44:36;01:44:38;"on the rock charts prior to this, right?"
01:44:38;01:44:39;"That's what I'm saying."
01:44:39;01:44:40;"That's why it's Michael Stipe."
01:44:40;01:44:43;"I guess also, this might have sounded pretty novel."

01:45:01;01:45:06;"This is tough."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"Wait, this is straight up like a Beck song."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Is this a cover?"
01:45:11;01:45:15;"It does sound like his flow on ""Loser."""
01:45:15;01:45:16;"Yeah."
01:45:16;01:45:19;"I heard some late period Beck on the radio the other day"
01:45:19;01:45:22;"on Sirius, and I was like, man, Beck is wack."

01:45:30;01:45:31;"I mean--"
01:45:31;01:45:32;"I like Beck."
01:45:32;01:45:34;"--the early stuff was like kind of novelty."
01:45:34;01:45:37;"Like, let's just take different production ideas"
01:45:37;01:45:40;"from other music and have his half-baked songs."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"And then after that, it was just like him"
01:45:42;01:45:45;"doing sincere singer-songwriter stuff."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"Beck's weak."
01:45:46;01:45:48;"I think he's one of the most overrated artists"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"of the last 20, 30 years."
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Jake."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"I like Beck."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"First of all, ""Loser"" holds up."
01:45:55;01:45:56;"Every time I hear that--"
01:45:56;01:45:57;"So good."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"--it's OK."
01:45:58;01:46:02;"Yeah, but compared-- like, that was an interesting mix of ideas."
01:46:02;01:46:04;"But ""Loser"" took that vibe and actually made something that,"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"like, still knocks today."
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Yeah."
01:46:07;01:46:09;"Beck's had a long and varied, fascinating career."
01:46:09;01:46:12;"But maybe we'll invite Beck on for an episode."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Oh, my god."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Poor Beck."
01:46:14;01:46:15;"Defending your--"

01:46:25;01:46:29;"You're dropping a spicy Gen X take on a Gen X icon, so--"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Yeah, he truly is."
01:46:31;01:46:36;"That song was ""Nana Cherry Trout"" featuring Michael Stipe."

01:46:45;01:46:46;"Yeah."

01:55:03;01:55:05;"Is it an artist that's big on the pop charts,"

02:00:35;02:00:36;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""STEAM""]"
02:00:36;02:00:40;"Was he in his 40s at this point?"
02:00:40;02:00:42;"Yeah, he was 42."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"Wow."
02:00:43;02:00:47;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""STEAM""]"
02:00:47;02:00:53;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""STEAM""]"
02:00:53;02:00:58;"[MUSIC - ROD STEWART, ""STEAM""]"
02:00:58;02:00:59;"It's good."
02:00:59;02:01:00;"I like it."
02:01:00;02:01:02;"Right on, Peter Gabriel."
02:01:02;02:01:06;"But yeah, definitely not much of a snapshot"
02:01:06;02:01:10;"of late December 1992 alternative rock."
02:01:10;02:01:12;"I thought we were going to get something off ""Nevermind"""
02:01:12;02:01:14;"or something off ""Use Your Illusion."""
02:01:14;02:01:15;"Yeah."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"I guess all the Nirvana and Pearl Jam songs"
02:01:17;02:01:19;"weren't in the top five anymore."
02:01:19;02:01:20;"They must have crushed."
02:01:20;02:01:21;"Can I ask a stupid question?"
02:01:21;02:01:25;"Is modern rock-- is that what became the alt chart?"
02:01:25;02:01:26;"Was that alternative rock?"
02:01:26;02:01:28;"Or was that a different chart?"
02:01:28;02:01:30;"That's a good question."
02:01:30;02:01:31;"Probably."
02:01:31;02:01:32;"Yeah, I have no idea."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"I bet."
02:01:33;02:01:36;"Because probably in '92, alternative--"
02:01:36;02:01:40;"the concept of alternative being this phrase everybody knew"
02:01:40;02:01:42;"was still probably spreading a little bit."
02:01:42;02:01:46;"So I bet it happened relatively soon after."
02:01:46;02:01:48;"One last question for you two."
02:01:48;02:01:52;"Rashida, what's the most indie alternative thing"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"that you liked growing up?"
02:01:54;02:01:58;"And Jake, what's the most hip hop R&B thing you liked?"
02:01:58;02:02:02;"Let's say when you were a teenager, college age."
02:02:02;02:02:04;"It doesn't have to be music, right?"
02:02:04;02:02:05;"Oh."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"I mean, yes, I was thinking it had to be--"
02:02:07;02:02:08;"but why?"
02:02:08;02:02:09;"What came to mind?"
02:02:09;02:02:11;"I was going to say fashion and movies."
02:02:11;02:02:14;"I wore Doc Martens and baby doll dresses."
02:02:14;02:02:17;"And I loved singles and reality bites."
02:02:17;02:02:18;"OK."
02:02:18;02:02:21;"But what about-- do you have any memory that was not"
02:02:21;02:02:26;"Warner Brothers swag of an album that was vaguely alternative,"
02:02:26;02:02:30;"indie, whatever, that you were like, I want to go buy this?"
02:02:30;02:02:32;"And you rolled up to Tower Records?"
02:02:32;02:02:34;"I remember really liking--"
02:02:34;02:02:37;"I mean, I don't know if I bought that Nirvana album."
02:02:37;02:02:40;"But what's that song that's like--"
02:02:40;02:02:43;"it's one of their most famous songs."
02:02:43;02:02:44;"And no, it's not."
02:02:44;02:02:45;"It smells like teen spirit."
02:02:45;02:02:48;"But I'm so happy that today--"
02:02:48;02:02:49;"Lithium."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"I love that song."
02:02:51;02:02:52;"I love that song."
02:02:52;02:02:53;"Great song."
02:02:53;02:02:55;"And I also like--"
02:02:55;02:02:58;"this is not alternative, but you guys watch this guy."
02:02:58;02:03:04;"You want it all, but you can't have it."
02:03:04;02:03:06;"That is alternative."
02:03:06;02:03:07;"That's Mike Patton."
02:03:07;02:03:09;"He loves that song."
02:03:09;02:03:13;"He's still like a beloved figure by alternative people"
02:03:13;02:03:16;"and you can do it with other bands and projects."
02:03:16;02:03:17;"Yeah, no, that's a tight song."
02:03:17;02:03:18;"I love that song."
02:03:18;02:03:20;"So good."
02:03:20;02:03:21;"All right, Jay, what about you?"
02:03:21;02:03:25;"Do you have any memories of something that you actually bought the CD?"
02:03:25;02:03:26;"Yeah, man."
02:03:26;02:03:29;"Snoop Dogg, Doggy Style record."
02:03:29;02:03:31;"Love that record."
02:03:31;02:03:32;"Classic album."
02:03:32;02:03:34;"I had the Warren G album."
02:03:34;02:03:35;"Love that one."
02:03:35;02:03:39;"What's the most R&B record you might have bought in the '90s?"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"You know what's really funny?"
02:03:41;02:03:46;"Going to the Kmart, trying to find the Blackstreet record."
02:03:46;02:03:47;"Oh, the No Diggity?"
02:03:47;02:03:51;"Like the ballad, like, don't leave me."
02:03:51;02:03:52;"That ballad."
02:03:52;02:03:53;"That is the best."
02:03:53;02:03:54;"Yeah, that song is amazing."
02:03:54;02:03:58;"I remember going to the Kmart and going to the music section"
02:03:58;02:04:01;"in my [BLEEP] Kmart in my [BLEEP] town."
02:04:01;02:04:04;"And they didn't have it."
02:04:04;02:04:06;"I was like, god damn."
02:04:06;02:04:07;"Let's go out on Don't Leave Me."
02:04:07;02:04:11;"Let's go out on the Jake and Rasheeda consensus pick."
02:04:11;02:04:12;"Yes?"
02:04:12;02:04:17;"I just have to say, this song is a sample from a switch,"
02:04:17;02:04:21;"which was a version of DeBarge before DeBarge, which is also"
02:04:21;02:04:22;"a great song called Fantasy."
02:04:22;02:04:23;"I just wanted to put that out there."
02:04:23;02:04:28;"No, because part of the reason I love that song is that really"
02:04:28;02:04:29;"melodic sample line."
02:04:29;02:04:31;"[HUMMING]"
02:04:31;02:04:35;"Hearing that later--"
02:04:35;02:04:39;"I do an acapella version of Don't Leave Me."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"A Chi style Don't Leave Me?"
02:04:40;02:04:41;"Like, yeah."
02:04:41;02:04:43;"(SINGING) Don't leave me, girl."
02:04:43;02:04:44;"Well, thanks, Rasheeda."
02:04:44;02:04:46;"Thank you to Winter."
02:04:46;02:04:50;"Everybody check out the first three chapters of Winter's book"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"on his website, Starbucks Everywhere,"
02:04:52;02:04:53;"I think it's called."
02:04:53;02:04:54;"But you'll be able to find his website."
02:04:54;02:04:56;"Check out On The Rocks."
02:04:56;02:05:01;"And here's the Gen X consensus pick, Black Street,"
02:05:01;02:05:03;"Don't Leave Me."
02:05:03;02:05:06;"Coming to you live from the U.S. in 2021."
02:05:06;02:05:07;"[MUSIC - ON THE ROCKS, ""DON'T LEAVE ME""]"
02:05:07;02:05:09;"(SINGING) I got mine."
02:05:09;02:05:16;"Let's just spend it all by putting it together, yeah."
02:05:16;02:05:20;"When you say you love me, it don't mean a thing."
02:05:20;02:05:28;"If you care, you'd be there like you used to be, yeah."
02:05:28;02:05:34;"I'm searching for the words to make you realize that I really,"
02:05:34;02:05:39;"really want you to stay, oh."
02:05:39;02:05:44;"Tears of suspicion I hold inside."
02:05:44;02:05:50;"But if you walk away, you'll make this cold make cry."
02:05:50;02:05:52;"Don't leave me, girl."
02:05:52;02:05:55;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
02:05:55;02:05:57;"Don't leave me, girl."
