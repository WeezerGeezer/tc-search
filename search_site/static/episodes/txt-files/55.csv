00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, November."
00:04;00:08;"It's the first Time Crisis since the World Series, so we'll talk about the Dodgers, the"
00:08;00:13;"Astros and baseball, perhaps the most frickin' random sport in America."
00:13;00:20;"We'll also talk to John Gourley of Portugal Demand and Tim Heidecker about his new album."
00:20;00:23;"All this, plus the top five songs on iTunes."
00:23;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:35;00:42;"[applause]"
01:18;01:25;"So, as we talked about on the last episode, a lot of people get their news from Time Crisis,"
01:25;01:29;"which is slightly irresponsible given that we're a bi-weekly show."
01:29;01:30;"And heavily biased."
01:30;01:33;"And heavily biased, so that's fine."
01:33;01:35;"Some people don't have time to catch up."
01:35;01:37;"So the Astros won the World Series."
01:37;01:39;"They won it about five days ago."
01:39;01:41;"I'm announcing it now."
01:41;01:42;"We watched game seven."
01:42;01:44;"We watched game seven together."
01:44;01:47;"It was interesting for me because, you know, I'm not really a sports guy."
01:47;01:48;"Yep."
01:48;01:50;"I thought you were a bit of a baseball nut."
01:50;01:51;"I know baseball historically."
01:51;01:54;"I can't front, like I'm a Dodgers fan."
01:54;01:55;"I can name like four players."
01:55;01:57;"But you know like the lingo."
01:57;02:01;"As we were watching it, you were making calls like, ""Should have put in Kershaw earlier."""
02:01;02:02;"Yeah."
02:02;02:04;"Whereas I know very little about baseball."
02:04;02:09;"But I watched the last two games because I'm here in LA working with a lot of LA-based"
02:09;02:10;"people."
02:10;02:14;"In my heart, I made a split-second decision that I wanted the Astros to win."
02:14;02:15;"Respect."
02:15;02:18;"Sports is really boring if you're not rooting for one team, right?"
02:18;02:20;"Is that generally understood in the sports community?"
02:20;02:22;"No, I wouldn't say that, but we can move on."
02:22;02:23;"Really?"
02:23;02:25;"Yeah, I can watch a game and not have a vested interest."
02:25;02:30;"You'll just like watch the Milwaukee Bucks are taking on the Utah Jazz and you'll just"
02:30;02:32;"be like, ""High level of gameplay."""
02:32;02:33;"Tell you what."
02:33;02:34;"Yeah."
02:34;02:38;"If I'm in a hotel room and I flip on ESPN and it's like four minutes left in the fourth"
02:38;02:41;"quarter and it's tied, I'll watch the end of it."
02:41;02:42;"Sure."
02:42;02:43;"Really?"
02:43;02:44;"Sure."
02:44;02:45;"Even with just like two random ass teams?"
02:45;02:46;"Yeah."
02:46;02:47;"If it's like a good vibe, if it's tense."
02:47;02:48;"Yeah, I just don't relate to that."
02:48;02:49;"So, tell me about Houston."
02:49;02:51;"Okay, so Houston versus the Dodgers."
02:51;02:54;"So my friend makes me watch game six."
02:54;02:56;"He's a born and raised LA guy."
02:56;02:59;"I do some very minor research."
02:59;03:02;"So I know that Houston suffered a hurricane."
03:02;03:03;"Hurricane Harvey."
03:03;03:04;"Crazy flooding."
03:04;03:07;"So on some level already, I feel like they could use a W."
03:07;03:11;"Isn't that weird that there's been two Harveys in the news in the last like two months?"
03:11;03:12;"That crossed my mind for a second."
03:12;03:19;"I was like, they're both just like too horrible for even anybody to like talk about."
03:19;03:20;"Anyway, it's kind of a random name."
03:20;03:22;"So Houston got slammed with a hurricane."
03:22;03:23;"Houston got slammed."
03:23;03:24;"So of course they could kind of use it."
03:24;03:25;"They've never won."
03:25;03:27;"And then I saw that they never won."
03:27;03:28;"So come on."
03:28;03:30;"Now I'm really kind of rooting for them."
03:30;03:36;"And then also like I had this feeling and this doesn't cover everybody, but I felt like"
03:36;03:40;"proportionally the Dodgers probably have more fake fans."
03:40;03:41;"Okay."
03:41;03:42;"Cause it's a big trendy city."
03:42;03:43;"Yeah."
03:43;03:44;"Okay."
03:44;03:45;"Sure."
03:45;03:48;"And I know that's not fair because the Dodgers probably have millions of fans born and raised"
03:48;03:51;"like grew up in a few miles from the park and they want to see him win."
03:51;03:53;"So I was kind of like, I don't know."
03:53;03:56;"There's something in my gut told me that Houston seemed more like the underdog."
03:56;04:01;"And I feel like it'd be corny for me being just like a semi LA resident to just like"
04:01;04:02;"root for them."
04:02;04:04;"Just get all ride or die Dodgers."
04:04;04:05;"Yeah."
04:05;04:07;"I would feel corny about that."
04:07;04:08;"Sure."
04:08;04:09;"That makes sense."
04:09;04:13;"But as the game unfolded and we were researching the players, just almost everything I would"
04:13;04:14;"hear about the Houston players."
04:14;04:18;"I was like, that is a more interesting squad."
04:18;04:19;"Right?"
04:19;04:22;"So first I was researching Altuve."
04:22;04:26;"I found out that he was the shortest guy in MLB."
04:26;04:32;"We were reading about Bregman, a Jewish kid out of Albuquerque, which I thought was random."
04:32;04:34;"Shout out to Mark Maron."
04:34;04:36;"Another Jew from Albuquerque."
04:36;04:42;"And then you pointed out one of the best guys, at least his backstory is one of the best"
04:42;04:43;"was Evan Gattis."
04:43;04:48;"Well, first of all, he's the only player that doesn't use batting gloves and his bat is"
04:48;04:51;"just like a raw piece of wood, no pine tar, no varnish."
04:51;04:54;"He just has like a primal connection."
04:54;04:56;"And then, yeah, his whole backstory was interesting."
04:56;05:03;"Like really into new age kind of healing culture out of New Mexico had been drafted originally"
05:03;05:08;"fell into some troubles with substance abuse and then like spent three or four years kind"
05:08;05:12;"of like in the wilderness, like working at ski resorts, living in his van."
05:12;05:13;"Right."
05:13;05:14;"So this guy, he was a hot baseball."
05:14;05:17;"He was like, he was nationally known as a high school player."
05:17;05:21;"How long has this just become like a sports show now?"
05:21;05:26;"With two guys that have no business talking about sports."
05:26;05:28;"Bear with us, Crisis Crew."
05:28;05:29;"We're going to get through this."
05:29;05:34;"We're talking about Evan Gattis, nationally recognized, one of the hottest players on"
05:34;05:37;"the high school circuit, full ride to Texas A&M."
05:37;05:41;"And then his senior year of high school around then, his life kind of fell apart."
05:41;05:42;"His parents got divorced."
05:42;05:44;"He started abusing substance."
05:44;05:45;"So he never ended up at college."
05:45;05:47;"That's like in movies and stuff."
05:47;05:52;"You're this golden athlete, pride of your high school, about to go to a huge school."
05:52;05:53;"Everybody's excited."
05:53;05:57;"Think about how much pressure, like even random people from your town are putting on you."
05:57;05:58;"That's a big deal."
05:58;06:01;"And then we were reading about like what he got up to instead of going to college."
06:01;06:07;"I guess he briefly went to a junior college in Oklahoma, tried playing some baseball,"
06:07;06:08;"burned out and quit."
06:08;06:14;"So then he left school in baseball and became a parking valet in Dallas."
06:14;06:19;"And then he went to Boulder, Colorado, worked in a pizza parlor and was a ski lift operator."
06:19;06:22;"Probably running some sweet delivery in Boulder."
06:22;06:24;"That's a kind of vibe city."
06:24;06:25;"But he still wasn't happy."
06:25;06:27;"He still suffered serious mental health problems."
06:27;06:29;"Former MLB prospect."
06:29;06:35;"Then he and his brother moved to Dallas where they worked as janitors for Datamatics Global"
06:35;06:37;"Services, which sounds made up."
06:37;06:39;"Yeah, it's like a Mike Judge film."
06:39;06:46;"Then he met a spiritual advisor who advised him that he should follow her to Taos, New"
06:46;06:47;"Mexico."
06:47;06:49;"He worked at a ski resort there."
06:49;06:50;"I don't know."
06:50;06:53;"We don't have all the info about what happened, but I guess that was some type of spiritual"
06:53;06:54;"reawakening for him."
06:54;06:56;"He became refreshed."
06:56;06:57;"He wanted to go back to school."
06:57;07:01;"He went back to University of Texas, but not big old Texas A&M."
07:01;07:04;"He ended up at the University of Texas at Permian Basin."
07:04;07:07;"He got another shot to play ball and then he ended up back in the MLB."
07:07;07:12;"But this is like a dude who, you know, especially when people talk about athletes, it seems"
07:12;07:16;"like the age like 18 to 23 is like a real prime time to like get your together."
07:16;07:18;"Yeah, you got to do it."
07:18;07:21;"That's where you go from like being the best player at your school or in your state to"
07:21;07:23;"being like a world class athlete."
07:23;07:28;"So to imagine that this in this period he was suffering in so many ways to come back"
07:28;07:32;"at age 23, 24, whatever, start playing high school, college ball again."
07:32;07:33;"Yeah."
07:33;07:34;"Already that's crazy."
07:34;07:36;"And then from there he ended up being on the Braves."
07:36;07:38;"Then he ended up winning a World Series."
07:38;07:41;"So when you told me about Evan Gattis, then I was like, these guys got to win."
07:41;07:48;"It reminded me of the 2001 series when it was a month and a half after 9/11 and the"
07:48;07:53;"Yankees were playing the Arizona Diamondbacks and it went to game seven and Rivera blew"
07:53;07:54;"the save."
07:54;08:00;"And I remember thinking at the time, like, wow, there is no cosmic justice in sports"
08:00;08:03;"as it relates to geopolitical events."
08:03;08:07;"Because if that's a year that the Yankees should have won the series, that was it."
08:07;08:08;"Oh, one."
08:08;08:10;"The first post September 11th World Series."
08:10;08:12;"It's like, wow, okay."
08:12;08:13;"There is no God."
08:13;08:14;"That's what I learned that day."
08:14;08:19;"Well, maybe God is back because God rewarded God was rooting for Houston."
08:19;08:21;"How does rooting for the Astros?"
08:21;08:22;"I'm gonna run up."
08:22;08:23;"It's not nice."
08:23;08:24;"But his life, I cannot change."
08:24;08:25;"It is deep off in the main."
08:25;08:26;"Eminem's we like it."
08:26;08:27;"I can't drop the top."
08:27;08:28;"Pop it."
08:28;08:29;"Let it bang."
08:29;08:30;"But his life, I cannot change."
08:30;08:31;"It is deep off in the main."

11:11;11:16;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1."
11:16;11:20;"- Also, baseball is probably the most random sport in a way."
11:20;11:22;"We're talking about this-- - I think it is."
11:22;11:26;"- That even these like incredibly gifted batters,"
11:26;11:27;"they're just hitting the ball willy nilly."
11:27;11:29;"- Baseball's hard."
11:29;11:31;"- It's a hard game. - All the sports are hard."
11:31;11:34;"- No, I'm into it, and I know it probably sounds like"
11:34;11:36;"here I am, this snooty guy"
11:36;11:37;"who doesn't know anything about sports,"
11:37;11:38;"like I'm dissing these guys."
11:38;11:40;"I know they're incredible athletes."
11:40;11:41;"I'm into it."
11:41;11:45;"I like that baseball is the most fricking random sport."
11:45;11:47;"I love also-- - Also, we're getting"
11:47;11:48;"full sports talk. - I know."
11:48;11:50;"I love to get into like also the cadence"
11:50;11:52;"of the way those guys on Sports Jurist talk,"
11:52;11:55;"except we're basically saying like nonsense,"
11:55;11:56;"very lightweight information."
11:56;11:59;"Football's a strategic game."
11:59;12:01;"- Your lineman, he's the favorite quarterback."
12:01;12:02;"- And he's deciding plays."
12:02;12:03;"- They're trying to keep the other team at bay."
12:03;12:06;"- Whereas baseball, you got a guy coming,"
12:06;12:09;"putting himself right on the spotlight."
12:09;12:11;"You got a batter standing there."
12:11;12:12;"- It's very existential."
12:12;12:14;"- He's not surrounded by guys."
12:14;12:15;"- It's completely chaotic."
12:15;12:18;"- It's a lot bigger than a basketball court,"
12:18;12:21;"so the guys are gonna be more spread out,"
12:21;12:25;"and here you could have a great athlete"
12:25;12:26;"swinging three times."
12:26;12:27;"Guess what?"
12:27;12:28;"He's out."
12:28;12:29;"- He's not coming back."
12:29;12:31;"I hate to break it to you."
12:31;12:34;"- You got one guy, he hits the cover off the ball,"
12:34;12:36;"and it goes straight to the shortstop."
12:36;12:38;"He catches it, you're out."
12:38;12:40;"You got another guy, he gets jammed."
12:40;12:43;"He pops it up, a little Texas leaguer"
12:43;12:44;"into the left field, it lands for a single,"
12:44;12:46;"you don't know."
12:46;12:49;"You hit the ball like bull crap, you get a single."
12:49;12:51;"- Jake, we got a hell of a show."
12:51;12:52;"We'll be talking to John Gorley,"
12:52;12:54;"lead singer of Portugal, The Man Later."
12:54;12:57;"We'll be talking to Tim Heidecker, live in the studio."
12:57;13:00;"A true legend of comedy and music."
13:00;13:02;"But first, let's dig in the mailbag,"
13:02;13:04;"'cause the mailbag's been on fire lately."
13:04;13:05;"- It really has."
13:05;13:07;"We got a lot of great emails."
13:07;13:09;"Unfortunately, we can't read them all."
13:09;13:10;"I would love to read them all."
13:10;13:13;"- There was a real standout email that you got"
13:13;13:15;"that you're telling me about, that's about Whole Foods."
13:15;13:19;"- It's time for Corporate Food History."
13:19;13:19;"(gunshot)"
13:19;13:21;"Let's talk about it."
13:21;13:23;"(imitating gunfire)"
13:23;13:26;"- In the last episode, we started talking about Whole Foods."
13:26;13:27;"Whole Foods was bought by Amazon."
13:27;13:28;"- Right."
13:28;13:29;"- So we were kind of thinking,"
13:29;13:31;"what was early Whole Foods like?"
13:31;13:33;"And did Willie Nelson go there?"
13:33;13:35;"Small, Austin-based place."
13:35;13:37;"Now, Whole Foods is part of the Amazon evil empire,"
13:37;13:39;"but back in the early days,"
13:39;13:41;"Whole Foods was an Austin institution."
13:41;13:43;"And we got an email about it."
13:43;13:45;"- Hey, Jake and Ezra, my name is Matt Winkler,"
13:45;13:48;"and I'm a resident of Austin, Texas,"
13:48;13:50;"the home of the OG Whole Foods."
13:50;13:52;"Like many, I'm a bit uneasy"
13:52;13:54;"about this Amazon-Whole Foods merger."
13:54;13:57;"But like a Republican donor at a Roger Waters show,"
13:57;13:59;"I didn't come here for the politics."
13:59;14:00;"I'm here for the music."
14:00;14:02;"Last week, you posed the question,"
14:02;14:04;"do you think Willie Nelson was shopping"
14:04;14:06;"at the Whole Foods back in the day?"
14:06;14:07;"For sure."
14:07;14:08;"He had to have been there."
14:08;14:10;"Within various scenes around the city,"
14:10;14:12;"Austin still feels like a small town."
14:12;14:15;"In 1980, during Whole Foods origins,"
14:15;14:19;"it was less than half the size, just under 400,000."
14:19;14:20;"That's a little bit smaller"
14:20;14:22;"than Minneapolis, Minnesota is today."
14:22;14:24;"Shout out to Sweet Martha's Cookies."
14:24;14:27;"The city was small enough then"
14:27;14:31;"that the founder, John Mackey, 25 at the time,"
14:31;14:33;"actually rode his bike around with his girlfriend,"
14:33;14:36;"who was 21, to find the location"
14:36;14:39;"for their first location for Saferway,"
14:39;14:41;"the predecessor to Whole Foods,"
14:41;14:43;"and his spoof on the grocery giant, Safeway."
14:43;14:44;"- I wanna point something out."
14:44;14:47;"I like picturing this, 25-year-old John Mackey"
14:47;14:50;"and his 21-year-old unnamed girlfriend."
14:50;14:51;"- 1980 Whole Foods."
14:51;14:53;"- There's so much that I like about this picture"
14:53;14:56;"'cause I've always been curious about early Austin."
14:56;14:59;"'Cause by the time I ever set foot in Austin"
14:59;15:02;"on tour of the Vampire Weekend, probably mid-2000s,"
15:02;15:03;"- Oh yeah."
15:03;15:04;"- Already, there were bumper stickers"
15:04;15:06;"that said, ""Keep Austin weird."""
15:06;15:07;"- Right."
15:07;15:08;"- And you know when you roll up to a place"
15:08;15:10;"and they got bumper stickers saying,"
15:10;15:12;"""Keep this place weird,"""
15:12;15:14;"it means you already missed something cool and weird."
15:14;15:17;"And to be fair, I respect the people"
15:17;15:18;"trying to keep it weird,"
15:18;15:20;"but weirdness is one of those things"
15:20;15:22;"that it's like once you start putting on bumper stickers"
15:22;15:25;"and then people like me are hearing about it,"
15:25;15:27;"you lost that authentic weirdness."
15:27;15:28;"- It's ephemeral."
15:28;15:31;"- So I bet 1980 Austin was weird as (beep)"
15:31;15:34;"- That location ended up being a multi-level"
15:34;15:37;"old Victorian house that doubled as their store and home."
15:37;15:40;"So the first one was just like truly hippie."
15:40;15:42;"Like I'm picturing like the bulk bins,"
15:42;15:45;"like in like the parlor of this old Victorian home."
15:45;15:47;"- Yeah, you probably walk in,"
15:47;15:49;"there's like a staircase that you go in the parlor."
15:49;15:51;"Somebody starts walking up the stairs"
15:51;15:52;"and it's like, ""You got a bathroom?"
15:52;15:53;"""We got one down there."
15:53;15:54;"""Someone's in that one."
15:54;15:56;"""Is there one upstairs?"""
15:56;15:59;"Man, that's my personal bathroom, man."
15:59;16:02;"I mean, is it an emergency?"
16:02;16:03;"Yeah, man."
16:03;16:05;"All right, man, let's not make a habit of this though."
16:05;16:08;"That's my home upstairs."
16:08;16:09;"- Back to the music."
16:09;16:12;"Last year, I worked at a print shop in Austin"
16:12;16:16;"and we were tasked with reprinting the original flyer"
16:16;16:19;"from the grand opening of Whole Foods Market in 1980"
16:19;16:22;"for a corporate anniversary event that we were having."
16:22;16:24;"There were a few entertaining details on it,"
16:24;16:26;"but there was one that stuck with me"
16:26;16:29;"was the musical artist headlining."
16:29;16:30;"None other than infamous Texan"
16:30;16:33;"and good friend of Willie Nelson, Ray Wiley Hubbard."
16:33;16:35;"If you're unfamiliar with Ray,"
16:35;16:36;"I'm sure you're in the same boat as most people"
16:36;16:38;"that now run Whole Foods."
16:38;16:40;"It's classic outlaw country that can veer"
16:40;16:43;"into psychedelic rock at the right live show."
16:43;16:45;"This sounds so up my alley, I have to say."
16:45;16:46;"- And you never heard of him?"
16:46;16:47;"- No, I never heard of him."
16:47;16:51;"Snake Farm is a personal favorite and old classic of his,"
16:51;16:53;"but he also just released new music."
16:53;16:55;"The single, ""Tell the Devil I'm Getting There"
16:55;16:57;"As Fast As I Can"" is awesome."
16:57;16:59;"He also just wrote a book with some great stories"
16:59;17:01;"about Willie in his wilder days."
17:01;17:03;"Ringo Starr's review on the back cover reads,"
17:03;17:04;"""Ray has written a book."
17:04;17:06;"I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure it's great."""
17:06;17:08;"Oh, Ringo, that humor."
17:08;17:11;"I can only imagine that Ray playing on that opening day"
17:11;17:12;"was quite the party."
17:12;17:14;"Okay, he sent in photos"
17:14;17:17;"from the Whole Foods 1980 grand opening."
17:17;17:19;"- We'll throw those up for everybody to see."
17:19;17:21;"- Well, let's hear what his song, ""Snake Farm"" sounds like."
17:24;17:36;"♪ Well, the woman I love is named Ramona ♪"
17:36;17:39;"♪ She kinda looks like Tempest Storm ♪"
17:39;17:42;"♪ She can dance like a little Egypt ♪"
17:42;17:46;"♪ She works down at the snake farm, snake farm ♪"
17:46;17:49;"♪ Just sounds nasty, snake farm ♪"
17:49;17:52;"♪ Pretty much is snake farm ♪"
17:52;17:56;"♪ It's a reptile house, snake farm ♪"
17:56;18:09;"One more paragraph here."
18:09;18:10;"We'll just read it over the music."
18:10;18:12;"1980, Austin, Texas."
18:12;18:14;"Summer's winding down, but something even more exciting"
18:14;18:16;"is buzzing on the horizon."
18:16;18:19;"Organic in every sense of the word."
18:19;18:21;"19 hippie Whole Foods employees and their friends"
18:21;18:22;"celebrating graduating from the co-op"
18:22;18:24;"to owning their own store."
18:24;18:27;"All fueled by the music of Ray Wiley and his prime."
18:27;18:30;"I like to imagine Willie might have been there"
18:30;18:31;"and sat in for a few tunes."
18:31;18:34;"At the very least, he crushed a few cold lone stars"
18:34;18:35;"from the audience."
18:35;18:36;"Take care, Matt."
18:36;18:37;"- Great email."
18:37;18:39;"- Hell of an email, Matt."
18:39;18:40;"- So that's interesting too."
18:40;18:41;"It's like the small group of people,"
18:41;18:43;"the original employees,"
18:43;18:45;"kinda sounds like they opened it together."
18:45;18:47;"I wonder if they all had equity in it."
18:47;18:52;"Are there 19 former Austin hippie billionaires?"
18:52;18:56;"- Or alienated, pissed off people that got lawyered out?"
18:56;18:59;"- We should make a movie like the Steve Jobs movie,"
18:59;19:00;"except it's about Whole Foods."
19:00;19:01;"- Oh man."
19:01;19:03;"You know who should make that is Richard Linklater."
19:03;19:04;"- Oh yeah."
19:04;19:06;"- 'Cause he's from Austin. - He's an Austin guy."
19:06;19:09;"- But he also makes movies that span time."
19:09;19:11;"Like that is his true subject in a way."
19:11;19:14;"Like there's the Before Sunrise trilogy,"
19:14;19:15;"and of course Boyhood."
19:15;19:18;"And plus Richard Linklater made Fast Food Nation."
19:18;19:19;"- Oh, so up his alley."
19:19;19:22;"- So he's tapped in with corporate America as a subject."
19:22;19:24;"Rick, if you're listening."
19:24;19:26;"- Make the Whole Foods movie, man."
19:26;19:28;"All right, so Jake, we got another good email."
19:28;19:30;"This one's about the '90s,"
19:30;19:33;"and it's a different perspective on the 1990s."
19:33;19:34;"And actually, I've been thinking about it lately,"
19:34;19:37;"especially as I've been in the studio,"
19:37;19:38;"kinda finishing up this album."
19:38;19:39;"- Yeah."
19:39;19:41;"- I've been thinking about different palettes."
19:41;19:43;"And maybe it's just 'cause of the age I'm at,"
19:43;19:44;"but I've been thinking back to my youth,"
19:44;19:46;"and the '90s palette has interested me"
19:46;19:48;"more than the '70s lately."
19:48;19:50;"- Specifically which '90s palette?"
19:50;19:52;"- I was just kinda thinking about all that music"
19:52;19:55;"that wasn't like grunge or hip hop,"
19:55;19:56;"but still was like on the radio all the time,"
19:56;20:01;"like Aerosmith, Hootie, Wallflowers, '90s Tom Petty."
20:01;20:03;"- Sure."
20:03;20:04;"- After the '80s, all those people were kinda like"
20:04;20:06;"trying to shake off the '80s,"
20:06;20:08;"that had like way more effects on the drums,"
20:08;20:09;"and kinda doing the '90s version"
20:09;20:11;"of the tasteful '70s palette."
20:11;20:13;"But it just was different."
20:13;20:14;"- Yeah."
20:14;20:15;"- 'Cause you know like when they were producing those records"
20:15;20:16;"they were probably like,"
20:16;20:18;"no, no, I don't want any of that '80s crap, man."
20:18;20:19;"I want it to sound like the '70s."
20:19;20:20;"But it just ended up sounding like the '90s."
20:20;20:21;"That's what happens."
20:21;20:24;"But anyway, this email is from Rebecca Hertz."
20:24;20:26;"Hi, Time Crisis crew."
20:26;20:27;"Care of Jake."
20:27;20:29;"Though I may not be in your typical demographic,"
20:29;20:31;"I am an avid TC listener and fan."
20:31;20:34;"The truth is we have no idea who our typical demographic is."
20:34;20:35;"- Yeah, I have no idea."
20:35;20:35;"- So you, who knows?"
20:35;20:37;"I am writing today to reopen a discussion"
20:37;20:38;"that I have heard you reference,"
20:38;20:40;"but I think the perspective could be widened a bit."
20:40;20:41;"The '90s."
20:41;20:44;"We've been pretty shallow on our '90s."
20:44;20:45;"- It's mostly GBV talk."
20:45;20:47;"- We talk about GBV."
20:47;20:49;"I was a teenager in the '90s."
20:49;20:50;"Okay, so if you're a teenager in the '90s, you're--"
20:50;20:52;"- She's like my age, probably."
20:52;20:54;"- I was partially a teenager in the '90s,"
20:54;20:57;"but yes, maybe late '70s, early '80s birth."
20:57;20:58;"I was a teenager in the '90s."
20:58;20:59;"That means I went to high school,"
20:59;21:01;"graduated from high school, went to college,"
21:01;21:02;"and graduated from college all in that decade."
21:02;21:04;"- Boom, class of '99 over here."
21:04;21:05;"- Class of '99, you got in at the buzzer."
21:05;21:06;"- Yep."
21:06;21:07;"- You're a true '90."
21:07;21:08;"Yeah, I've never thought about that"
21:08;21:11;"in like in terms of eras, to put it that way."
21:11;21:12;"We gotta come up with a name for that"
21:12;21:15;"when your entire eight years from freshman year"
21:15;21:17;"of high school through senior year of college"
21:17;21:18;"is in one decade."
21:18;21:20;"What do we call that, golden eight?"
21:20;21:21;"Tight eight."
21:21;21:22;"- Just a tight eight."
21:22;21:23;"- Just a tight eight."
21:23;21:24;"- '91 and '99, bud."
21:24;21:27;"- You had a tight eight, so you're a true '90s guy."
21:27;21:28;"- It's a great eight."
21:28;21:33;"- My tight eight was from 1998 to 2006."
21:33;21:35;"- Wait, you were a freshman in college,"
21:35;21:36;"and okay, that makes sense."
21:36;21:38;"I'm seven years older than you."
21:38;21:39;"That's just funny to think about."
21:39;21:40;"You were a freshman in high school,"
21:40;21:43;"and I'm like entering my senior year of college."
21:43;21:44;"(laughing)"
21:44;21:45;"Imagine if we could have met then."
21:45;21:47;"- We would have still been bros."
21:47;21:48;"- Oh yeah, for sure."
21:48;21:49;"- We would have hit it off."
21:49;21:51;"- Oh yeah, but I would have been 21."
21:51;21:53;"You would have been 14."
21:53;21:54;"- Yeah."
21:54;21:56;"- You want a brew, man, or?"
21:56;21:58;"- I think I had my first beer at 14,"
21:58;22:00;"but anyway, I had a real frickin' random,"
22:00;22:03;"but I've always, in a way, I've been blessed."
22:03;22:05;"I felt like my high school through college years"
22:05;22:08;"was such a frickin' random like (beep) time in history."
22:08;22:11;"Just late 90s, American hubris."
22:11;22:14;"- Yeah, you're going from Clinton to Bush, it's brutal."
22:14;22:15;"- But even like the height of the Clinton years"
22:15;22:17;"is kinda gross and (beep) up."
22:17;22:17;"- Sure."
22:17;22:19;"- And then into Bush, and so in some ways,"
22:19;22:20;"there was kinda something cool about like"
22:20;22:24;"I began my working life as a teacher for a year,"
22:24;22:26;"Vampire Weekend comes out, Obama becomes president,"
22:26;22:29;"and then we get like a kinda, a tight eight."
22:29;22:31;"Or a seemingly tight eight."
22:31;22:32;"At least we could like pat ourselves on the back."
22:32;22:33;"- Well, let's take it."
22:33;22:35;"Let's just say it's a tight eight."
22:35;22:36;"- I guess we're about to have some kids"
22:36;22:39;"who had a full 2010s tight eight."
22:39;22:41;"I love that Rebecca helped us talk about this concept"
22:41;22:42;"of the tight eight."
22:42;22:44;"So she had a tight eight, she went to high school,"
22:44;22:46;"college, all that (beep) in the 90s."
22:46;22:47;"I went to high school in Los Angeles"
22:47;22:48;"and college in Manhattan."
22:48;22:50;"My experience of the 90s is radically different"
22:50;22:52;"than the one I've heard you guys talk about on the show."
22:52;22:54;"It was not a period of calm politically."
22:54;22:56;"We could see the tidal wave of hyper-militarized"
22:56;22:58;"corporate oppression approaching,"
22:58;23:00;"and we did everything we could to work against it."
23:00;23:02;"The music of the time reflected that."
23:02;23:04;"In fact, I look at the 90s as a time"
23:04;23:06;"of deeply political music."
23:06;23:07;"- And that's kind of what I was just saying"
23:07;23:08;"about the Obama years."
23:08;23:10;"It's like in retrospect,"
23:10;23:14;"because we have such brutally, openly harsh presidents,"
23:14;23:17;"we start to look back through rose-colored glasses"
23:17;23:20;"at when Obama was president, when Clinton was president."
23:20;23:21;"And then of course, as we start to realize,"
23:21;23:24;"like, whoa, Clinton, they signed the crime bill."
23:24;23:26;"It's a very good point."
23:26;23:28;"So anyway, here's some of Rebecca's examples"
23:28;23:30;"of political music from the 90s."
23:30;23:33;"See Sonic Youth's 1992 album, ""Dirty,"""
23:33;23:36;"song ""Swimsuit Issue"" about sexual harassment in Hollywood,"
23:36;23:38;"great San Fernando Valley references too,"
23:38;23:41;"and ""Youth Against Fascism,"" which is anti-Nazi,"

24:05;24:07;"- Yeah, it's the number one song for them on,"
24:07;24:08;"oh, this is good."

24:31;24:32;"yeah, that grunge 30s."
24:32;24:34;"- Almost like a Weezer."

25:05;25:07;"in the face of the first Gulf War."
25:07;25:09;"Then there was Tupac, the progeny of Black Panthers,"
25:09;25:12;"Public Enemy, and other hip hop groups like Wu-Tang"
25:12;25:15;"who were addressing mass incarceration and white supremacy."
25:15;25:17;"While Nirvana might've been the breakout alternative band"
25:17;25:19;"from this era, they were deeply influenced"
25:19;25:20;"by the other bands I've mentioned,"

25:23;25:25;"One could argue that they were fiercely anti-corporate"
25:25;25:27;"and their commercial success and co-option"
25:27;25:28;"by the mainstream music industry"

25:31;25:32;"Thanks for taking the time to think"
25:32;25:34;"about our shared music history in a different way."
25:34;25:37;"Best, Rebecca Hurts, Los Angeles."
25:37;25:38;"Well, Rebecca's right."
25:38;25:40;"Like, I mean, we certainly never talked"
25:40;25:42;"about political music in the '90s."
25:42;25:44;"I know, Jake, for you-"
25:44;25:45;"- How have we characterized the '90s?"
25:45;25:47;"As like aloof and ironic, maybe?"
25:47;25:48;"- Probably."
25:48;25:49;"That's a typical characterization of the '90s."
25:49;25:51;"- Like pavement and that kind of stuff?"
25:51;25:53;"- I think once we were talking about U2,"
25:53;25:55;"that U2's shift from the '80s into the '90s"
25:55;26:00;"meant dropping sincere emotion and going into irony mode."
26:00;26:01;"But Rebecca's right."
26:01;26:04;"In any generation, there are people still flying the flag"
26:04;26:08;"for anti-corporate ideas, fighting white supremacy,"
26:08;26:11;"fighting mass incarceration with their art."
26:11;26:13;"I guess sometimes you don't get all those things"
26:13;26:17;"coalescing into a giant movement at the same time"
26:17;26:19;"in quite the same picker-esque way"
26:19;26:21;"that it happened in the '60s,"
26:21;26:23;"but that doesn't mean that it was like"
26:23;26:24;"there were less people caring."
26:24;26:28;"- Yeah, in the '60s, the major kind of"
26:28;26:31;"divisive social issues were larger, basically,"
26:31;26:32;"than they were in the '90s."
26:32;26:35;"- Or not even larger, but like more straightforward."
26:35;26:36;"- Right."
26:36;26:38;"- And that is a tough one because-"
26:38;26:40;"- Easier to kind of point your finger at."
26:40;26:42;"- Yeah, 'cause you could say to somebody something like,"
26:42;26:44;"in the '60s, I guess if you were arguing"
26:44;26:47;"with a white supremacist and you were like saying like,"
26:47;26:49;"you know, black people are treated terribly in this country,"
26:49;26:50;"you'd be like, ""Give me one example."""
26:50;26:53;"And you could be like, ""The Jim Crow laws of the South."""
26:53;26:56;"Whereas today, people actually use that"
26:56;26:57;"to try to pretend that nothing's the matter."
26:57;26:58;"It'd be like somebody would be like,"
26:58;26:59;"""Well, it's not the '60s."
26:59;27:01;"""There's no segregated waterfronts."""
27:01;27:03;"You'd be like, ""Yeah, but there's,"" like she was saying,"
27:03;27:06;"""There's the hyper-militarized corporate way"
27:06;27:09;"""that the police and the private prison"
27:09;27:10;"""industrial complex worked together."""
27:10;27:11;"Those are-"
27:11;27:13;"- Institutionalized, yeah."
27:13;27:16;"- Harder concepts in some ways for some people."
27:16;27:17;"Certainly not all people,"
27:17;27:19;"but for some people to understand."
27:19;27:21;"I mean, right now is a very political time."
27:21;27:23;"There's plenty of people out there protesting."
27:23;27:25;"There's people making political music."
27:25;27:27;"It's now like the '60s, Jake."
27:27;27:29;"- Are there people making political music"
27:29;27:32;"that are huge superstars?"
27:32;27:33;"- Yeah, people would say that Beyonce"
27:33;27:36;"was very political on her last album."
27:36;27:39;"Katy Perry was vaguely political on her last album."
27:39;27:42;"As we talked about, Eminem went on BET"
27:42;27:44;"and dropped, literally threatened to drop"
27:44;27:46;"a very hot coffee pot on the president."
27:46;27:48;"So I know, I know it's funny,"
27:48;27:50;"but on a very basic level,"
27:50;27:53;"if we want to take off our music critic glasses"
27:53;27:56;"for a second, is Eminem getting up there"
27:56;27:59;"and saying, ""That's an awfully hot coffee pot."""
27:59;28:01;"What's different about that versus the-"
28:01;28:04;"♪ There's something happening here ♪"
28:04;28:06;"- Yeah, is that so much better?"
28:06;28:10;"♪ What it is ain't exactly clear ♪"

28:28;28:29;"- Do you think there's some dad somewhere"
28:29;28:32;"who used to be liberal and became conservative"
28:32;28:37;"and sees his son or daughter watching the Eminem freestyle"
28:37;28:40;"and is like, ""Listen, I used to be idealistic in the '60s"
28:40;28:43;"""and we did have real problems in the '60s."""
28:43;28:44;"- Oh, I'm sure."
28:44;28:46;"- ""But we didn't have some dumb millionaire"
28:46;28:49;"""talking about an awfully hot coffee pot."
28:49;28:51;"""We had young, passionate people saying,"

28:55;28:56;"- They were millionaires too, but I mean-"
28:56;28:58;"- ""Yeah, we didn't have the internet back then,"
28:58;29:01;"""so we found out what was going on from-"""
29:01;29:04;"- The musicians, man. - ""From the musicians, man."""
29:04;29:06;"Yeah, when you really get down into it,"
29:06;29:08;"and I'm not trying to pit them against each other,"
29:08;29:10;"but it's like, you know."
29:10;29:14;"- No, it's easy to idealize the '60s protest music."
29:14;29:15;"That's for sure."
29:15;29:17;"- I think it's good to take all protest music"
29:17;29:19;"with a grain of salt, not pit it against each other"
29:19;29:22;"and say, ""60s protest music is corny"
29:22;29:24;"""if you look at it through a certain lens."
29:24;29:29;"""90s protest music is a little impressionistic in a way."""
29:29;29:32;"- It's a generation removed, yeah."
29:32;29:33;"- 'Cause you can have a sense of irony"
29:33;29:35;"and still be very passionate about political issues,"
29:35;29:40;"but it's all art, and art can just sit there"
29:40;29:42;"and be a reflection of the moment, and that's cool."
29:42;29:45;"I think art should be a reflection of the moment,"
29:45;29:48;"but I guess then you still gotta vote,"
29:48;29:53;"still gotta read books, gotta do all the kinda boring stuff"
29:53;29:55;"to affect political change, protest."
29:55;29:57;"- It's interesting how Nirvana really wasn't political,"
29:57;30:00;"'cause they, yeah, as Rebecca says,"
30:00;30:02;"I mean, they definitely were influenced"
30:02;30:07;"by all those bands, Sonic Youth, L7,"
30:07;30:12;"all of the Kill Rockstars bands, all the K Records bands,"
30:12;30:17;"but Kurt Cobain's songs were weirdly kinda personal."
30:17;30:18;"- Well, if you watch the documentary"
30:18;30:19;"and you read interviews about him,"
30:19;30:21;"you realize that he had very strong feelings"
30:21;30:23;"about gender equality. - Absolutely."
30:23;30:25;"- He hated the patriarchy,"
30:25;30:27;"he hated the white male patriarchy."
30:27;30:30;"He felt, even him as a white male, he felt victimized by it,"
30:30;30:33;"and truth is, white males are victimized in their own way."
30:33;30:34;"- That's a winning argument."
30:34;30:36;"- Yeah, no, but that's an argument"
30:36;30:38;"that I've heard extremely woke people make."
30:38;30:41;"I'm not trying to say that they're victimized"
30:41;30:42;"in the sense that they got it just as bad"
30:42;30:45;"as everybody else, I'm saying this is a very old idea"
30:45;30:47;"that in any kind of oppressive system,"
30:47;30:52;"the oppressor is also being sucked into something horrible."
30:52;30:53;"You know, that's some (beep)"
30:53;30:54;"that Nelson Mandela would say."
30:54;30:55;"- Okay."
30:55;30:58;"- Like, even him, as a black man in apartheid South Africa,"
30:58;31:00;"being treated like a subhuman,"
31:00;31:03;"even he, when he would talk about his prison guards,"
31:03;31:04;"when he's in prison forever,"
31:04;31:06;"would talk about the way in which they were,"
31:06;31:08;"maybe victim's not the right word,"
31:08;31:09;"but that their lives were sucked"
31:09;31:11;"into this oppressive system, too."
31:11;31:13;"- He had sympathy for them."
31:13;31:15;"- Yeah, I think you could call it a type of sympathy."
31:15;31:17;"But anyway, my point is that Kurt Cobain,"
31:17;31:20;"it seemed like he felt victimized by growing up in a macho,"
31:20;31:21;"'cause he would describe his hometown"
31:21;31:23;"as being full of macho rednecks."
31:23;31:23;"- Yeah."
31:23;31:24;"- And because even though he was a white male,"
31:24;31:26;"he wasn't that."
31:26;31:28;"So people were mean to him,"
31:28;31:30;"made him feel like (beep) abused him, whatever."
31:30;31:32;"So the more you know about Kurt Cobain,"
31:32;31:33;"the more you know that he's definitely somebody"
31:33;31:35;"who had political views."
31:35;31:37;"To pull that out of the music,"
31:37;31:39;"because his lyrics are so impressionistic,"
31:39;31:41;"is not exactly an easy task."
31:41;31:42;"- Yeah."
31:42;31:43;"- But the music and the lyrics are still great."

33:49;33:52;"- Okay, so Jake, you weren't familiar with them already,"
33:52;33:55;"but we were listening to a song that's been"
33:55;33:57;"racing up the charts the past few months,"
33:57;33:59;"Feel It Still by Portugal the Man."
33:59;34:03;"And when we first heard it, you correctly pointed out"
34:03;34:06;"that there was kind of a riff from Please Mr. Postman,"
34:06;34:08;"and then we looked them up when they were from Wasilla."
34:08;34:09;"- Yeah."
34:09;34:10;"- Alaska."
34:10;34:11;"So anyway, we got John Gourley,"
34:11;34:13;"the lead singer of Portugal the Man, calling in."
34:13;34:14;"- Love it."
34:14;34:15;"- He's down to talk about whatever,"
34:15;34:17;"answer our questions about Feel It Still,"
34:17;34:19;"answer our questions about Alaska."
34:19;34:20;"Very psyched about this one."
34:20;34:21;"- Let's do it."
34:21;34:25;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
34:25;34:28;"(phone ringing)"
34:28;34:29;"- Hello?"
34:29;34:30;"- Hey John, what's up?"
34:30;34:31;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
34:31;34:33;"You're on with me, Ezra, and Jake."
34:33;34:34;"- What up?"
34:34;34:35;"- What up?"
34:35;34:35;"- How you doing?"
34:35;34:37;"Where you calling from, John?"
34:37;34:39;"- I'm in Portland, Oregon right now."
34:39;34:41;"We have a little break from tour,"
34:41;34:43;"hanging out with my daughter."
34:43;34:44;"- How old?"
34:44;34:45;"- Six years old."
34:45;34:48;"- So you're a Portland-based musician,"
34:48;34:51;"but one thing that we definitely wanna talk about with you"
34:51;34:53;"is your Alaskan heritage."
34:53;34:57;"So we read that your father moved to Alaska,"
34:57;34:59;"but he went to Woodstock."
34:59;35:04;"So does that mean he was like a continental US hippie"
35:04;35:05;"who decided to get out of Dodge"
35:05;35:07;"and see what was popping in Alaska?"
35:07;35:08;"What's the story?"
35:08;35:10;"How did your family end up in Alaska?"
35:10;35:13;"- Yeah, so my dad is,"
35:13;35:16;"he is a hippie in kind of like the loose sense of it."
35:16;35:19;"He cares about people, cares about the environment,"
35:19;35:20;"things like that."
35:20;35:22;"He's not a pacifist in any way."
35:22;35:24;"I'd say he's one of the hardest working people I know,"
35:24;35:26;"and he's worked for everything,"
35:26;35:29;"and he's the type of guy that will get in a fist fight."
35:29;35:30;"- So he's like a tough hippie."
35:30;35:32;"- Yeah, he's like a tough hippie."
35:32;35:34;"In his circle of friends,"
35:34;35:36;"his best friend's dad actually is the one"
35:36;35:38;"that inspired him and his group"
35:38;35:42;"to move from Morrisville, New York up to Alaska."
35:42;35:44;"- So he moved with a whole posse?"
35:44;35:47;"- Yeah, so my dad and a group of his friends,"
35:47;35:49;"his friend's dad is Robert Durr,"
35:49;35:51;"who wrote ""The Iceman Cometh."""
35:51;35:52;"- Oh, wow."
35:52;35:54;"- There must've been something in the air at that time."
35:54;35:57;"Alaska is known as the last frontier."
35:57;35:59;"My mom and dad are both from the same town,"
35:59;36:00;"Morrisville, New York,"
36:00;36:04;"and moved up there kind of around the same time."
36:04;36:06;"Didn't know each other in Morrisville,"
36:06;36:09;"but met each other in Wasilla, Alaska."
36:09;36:10;"- There's just a lot of people"
36:10;36:12;"on that Morrisville to Wasilla circuit?"
36:12;36:14;"That's a coincidence?"
36:14;36:17;"- I think it's all around that circle of friends"
36:17;36:19;"and that group, you know?"
36:19;36:21;"- But what's the story about him going to Woodstock?"
36:21;36:22;"Was this right after Woodstock,"
36:22;36:24;"they decided to make the move?"
36:24;36:25;"- Well, Woodstock happened,"
36:25;36:27;"my dad graduated in '69."
36:27;36:29;"- From high school?"
36:29;36:30;"- Yeah. - Okay."
36:30;36:31;"- You know, if I'm being honest,"
36:31;36:34;"I never really got a lot of the stories about Woodstock."
36:34;36:36;"I never really got a lot of these,"
36:36;36:38;"the things that's happened to my dad."
36:38;36:40;"Like I've gotten these little bits and pieces"
36:40;36:42;"as we've gone along."
36:42;36:46;"I mean, my gift to him 10 years ago was a tape recorder."
36:46;36:48;"So I have all of his stories"
36:48;36:50;"stored on his tape recorder somewhere."
36:50;36:51;"- Oh, that's amazing. - That he gave me"
36:51;36:52;"at some point."
36:52;36:55;"But I've gotten little bits and pieces along the way."
36:55;36:57;"- The newest Portugal, the Man album is called Woodstock."
36:57;36:58;"- Yeah, yeah."
36:58;37:00;"Which is loosely inspired by that."
37:00;37:02;"- Okay. - Woodstock '94, right?"
37:02;37:04;"(laughing)"
37:04;37:06;"- Woodstock '99. - My dad went to Woodstock '94."
37:06;37:08;"- There is something interesting to me."
37:08;37:09;"Obviously, I don't know your dad,"
37:09;37:11;"but it's like, that's like kind of intense"
37:11;37:15;"that you would be 1969, you just graduated high school."
37:15;37:17;"You already live in upstate New York"
37:17;37:21;"and you happen to witness this iconic,"
37:21;37:23;"epic, gigantic concert of hippies."
37:23;37:28;"Like, you couldn't, in 1969, in terms of like youth culture,"
37:28;37:30;"you couldn't possibly have been more in the mix"
37:30;37:31;"than being at Woodstock."
37:31;37:32;"- It's ground zero."
37:32;37:36;"- So like one year, your dad is looking around"
37:36;37:38;"at like America's finest hippies together,"
37:38;37:42;"Jimi Hendrix just ripping into the national anthem."
37:42;37:45;"One year later, he's in Wasilla, Alaska."
37:45;37:48;"Like that's a hell of a year, a year to year."
37:48;37:49;"- Yeah, I'd say so."
37:49;37:53;"And the way they did it, when they went up to Alaska,"
37:53;37:55;"my dad and his group of friends, they all went out,"
37:55;37:59;"actually to Taquita and the Chase Mountain Range,"
37:59;38:01;"and they all went their separate ways."
38:01;38:04;"It was at this time when you could stake a claim on land."
38:04;38:05;"- Really?"
38:05;38:06;"These were 19 year old dudes just like--"
38:06;38:07;"- Homesteading?"
38:07;38:10;"- Just homesteading in 1970?"
38:10;38:10;"That's amazing."
38:10;38:13;"- My dad didn't even have the $50 or whatever it was"
38:13;38:16;"to pay for the deed or the title on the land."
38:16;38:17;"So they were just living out,"
38:17;38:20;"kind of, I mean, really in the middle of nowhere."
38:20;38:23;"They're in this place that nobody really knows a lot about"
38:23;38:25;"at the time, and just living off the land."
38:25;38:27;"And they did this for three years."
38:27;38:29;"I'm pretty sure that was the whole plan."
38:29;38:30;"They all went out to the mountains,"
38:30;38:31;"went their separate ways,"
38:31;38:33;"they lived off the land for three years,"
38:33;38:36;"and then came back to town and all met up."
38:36;38:37;"- That's wild."
38:37;38:39;"Okay, so then flash forward to your birth."
38:39;38:42;"So you're growing up in Wasilla, Alaska."
38:42;38:45;"For people like us, never been to Alaska before,"
38:45;38:47;"obviously Wasilla in the past 10 years,"
38:47;38:49;"most people associate it with Sarah Palin."
38:49;38:51;"What's the vibe of Wasilla?"
38:51;38:53;"Is it like semi-rural?"
38:53;38:54;"How big is the town?"
38:54;38:56;"Is there a Best Buy there?"
38:56;38:59;"- Well, I think now we have Target,"
38:59;39:01;"we have all that big city stuff."
39:01;39:03;"Growing up, we didn't really have a lot."
39:03;39:06;"I think there were 5,000 people in Wasilla"
39:06;39:07;"when we were growing up there."
39:07;39:10;"And when you say 5,000 people in Wasilla,"
39:10;39:15;"you're counting anywhere from 20 to 50 miles around Wasilla."
39:15;39:16;"- The hinterlands."
39:16;39:19;"- Yeah, they kind of take everybody in there."
39:19;39:21;"It was a pretty small place."
39:21;39:24;"I mean, we grew up hanging out at the car's parking lot,"
39:24;39:26;"which is like our grocery store."
39:26;39:27;"- Whoa."
39:27;39:28;"When I was a kid, I'd sometimes hang out"
39:28;39:29;"in the 7-Eleven parking lot,"
39:29;39:32;"but even that's kind of a different vibe."
39:32;39:35;"So was there, for instance, a record store"
39:35;39:36;"anywhere near you?"
39:36;39:38;"- We did have a record store."
39:38;39:39;"So even when I grew up in Wasilla,"
39:39;39:42;"I was 15, 20 miles away."
39:42;39:44;"I grew up in a really amazing place."
39:44;39:45;"(laughs)"
39:45;39:46;"I gotta be straight about that."
39:46;39:48;"When you grow up in these spots,"
39:48;39:50;"I never thought about how great it was"
39:50;39:52;"that I grew up on the Cook Inlet."
39:52;39:55;"My neighbors were five miles away,"
39:55;39:56;"and we grew up on the Cook Inlet,"
39:56;39:59;"which is this kind of deep, gray,"
39:59;40:02;"silty body of water behind our house."
40:02;40:04;"And we'd have these,"
40:04;40:06;"like every year we'd have beluga whales"
40:06;40:07;"swimming up behind my house."
40:07;40:08;"- That's unreal."
40:08;40:09;"So you're just a kid looking out the window"
40:09;40:11;"and you see some belugas."
40:11;40:14;"- Yeah, and I don't give a (beep) at all,"
40:14;40:16;"because I've seen it a million times."
40:16;40:18;"Every year I'd see the same beluga whales coming up."
40:18;40:21;"- You wouldn't even look up from your Game Boy?"
40:21;40:24;"- Yeah, I'd be hanging out with friends,"
40:24;40:25;"playing in the woods,"
40:25;40:26;"and my friends would see the whales"
40:26;40:28;"coming up the water with the tide."
40:28;40:31;"And it's just this deep, gray, silt water"
40:31;40:34;"with these white whales kind of rolling around,"
40:34;40:35;"and they would flip out,"
40:35;40:37;"and I'd say, ""Come on, man."
40:37;40:38;"""Yeah, there's (beep) whales."
40:38;40:39;"""They're back there all the time."
40:39;40:40;"""Get your stick."
40:40;40:42;"""Let's go play guns in the woods."""
40:42;40:44;"- For you, that was like seeing a pigeon."
40:44;40:45;"- Yeah, it was just like,"
40:45;40:46;"I'd see that (beep) all the time."
40:46;40:49;"- Were there grizzly bears around?"
40:49;40:50;"- Oh, yeah, we had bears."
40:50;40:53;"We had black bears, grizzly bears."
40:53;40:54;"- So was that a concern,"
40:54;40:57;"when playing in the woods as a kid,"
40:57;40:58;"were your parents like,"
40:58;40:59;"""Well, there's grizzlies around."
40:59;41:01;"""Don't get eaten by a grizzly,"""
41:01;41:04;"or if you see a grizzly, play dead?"
41:04;41:05;"- Well, I know this is controversial,"
41:05;41:07;"but I grew up in Alaska."
41:07;41:11;"I was carrying guns at like 15 years old."
41:11;41:13;"Carrying guns with me,"
41:13;41:15;"and looking back on it now,"
41:15;41:16;"absolutely ridiculous."
41:16;41:19;"This little kid is gonna shoot at a bear"
41:19;41:20;"if he comes at him."
41:20;41:22;"- Were the guns for the bears, though?"
41:22;41:25;"- Yeah, the guns were for the bear, for protection."
41:25;41:27;"I mean, literally, like there's moose out there,"
41:27;41:28;"there's bears."
41:28;41:31;"Moose are just so much crazier"
41:31;41:32;"than anybody ever thinks."
41:32;41:34;"We see stories in the paper every year"
41:34;41:37;"about some tourist got the (beep) kicked out of him"
41:37;41:39;"by a moose, trying to go and pet it,"
41:39;41:41;"'cause they look so dopey,"
41:41;41:45;"but they're just this hyper-aggressive giant horse."
41:45;41:45;"(laughs)"
41:45;41:47;"I mean, they'll kick you."
41:47;41:48;"- They'll stomp you. - Right, no, no,"
41:48;41:48;"that's a good point."
41:48;41:52;"People think of moose as being like a cute,"
41:52;41:53;"goofball animal."
41:53;41:56;"Like, they call that ice cream, moose tracks."
41:56;41:58;"Like, moose, people almost talk about moose"
41:58;42:00;"like they're rabbits or something,"
42:00;42:02;"whereas the truth is, moose is like the lion"
42:02;42:05;"of the ecosystem in some places."
42:05;42:06;"- Yeah, dude, every one of us"
42:06;42:09;"have been chased by a moose at one point."
42:09;42:10;"- That's like a Wasilla Rite of Passage,"
42:10;42:12;"is getting chased by a moose?"
42:12;42:13;"- Yeah, you've been chased by a moose."
42:13;42:15;"- So, obviously, Wasilla's a place"
42:15;42:19;"full of natural beauty, majestic creatures."
42:19;42:19;"What's the vibe?"
42:19;42:23;"Like, at your school, as somebody who was interested"
42:23;42:26;"in, or had at least a burgeoning interest in music"
42:26;42:28;"and maybe a left-of-center taste in music,"
42:28;42:31;"were you a weirdo, or it's just a small town,"
42:31;42:33;"everybody knows each other, it's pretty chill?"
42:33;42:34;"- Everybody knew each other."
42:34;42:36;"It's like any other small town."
42:36;42:38;"I mean, you tour quite a bit as well."
42:38;42:41;"Whenever you hit the small towns, like middle America,"
42:41;42:43;"it always reminds me of Alaska."
42:43;42:46;"It's just, yeah, there's the freaks, there's the jocks,"
42:46;42:49;"there's the stoners and the skaters,"
42:49;42:52;"and I was always obsessed with that stuff."
42:52;42:54;"Kind of a lot of the music I found in high school"
42:54;42:56;"was through, like, ""Welcome to Hell."""
42:56;42:58;"It was Toy Machine and Ed Templeton,"
42:58;43:01;"and I was in that circle, like the skater kid."
43:01;43:04;"I was my group of friends, but where I lived,"
43:04;43:05;"I didn't have any pavement."
43:05;43:07;"I couldn't skateboard."
43:07;43:08;"I would just watch these movies."
43:08;43:10;"- Did you own a skateboard?"
43:10;43:12;"- No, I had no use for one."
43:12;43:14;"I would go snowboarding."
43:14;43:15;"- No, I'm with you."
43:15;43:19;"I love the culture of skate movies."
43:19;43:20;"I've never skateboarded in my life,"
43:20;43:22;"but yeah, I was kind of enjoyed watching that."
43:22;43:23;"The music's great."
43:23;43:25;"It's like seeing the dudes goof off."
43:25;43:28;"You learn a lot from them, especially when you're a kid."
43:28;43:29;"- Yeah, that's what I was really obsessed with,"
43:29;43:32;"and it was Ed Templeton in particular,"
43:32;43:35;"was his style, his art, everything around Toy Machine"
43:35;43:38;"was really exciting to me."
43:38;43:39;"I loved his high waters"
43:39;43:42;"and his kind of nerdy look that he had."
43:42;43:43;"That was all really cool,"
43:43;43:46;"but it was just everything that we saw"
43:46;43:48;"had to be shipped in."
43:48;43:50;"You couldn't walk down the street and find that."
43:50;43:52;"So a lot of the music that we came across"
43:52;43:53;"was through our parents."
43:53;43:56;"And that's where Woodstock comes into play."
43:56;44:01;"It was my dad showing me that VHS copy of Woodstock"
44:01;44:06;"and seeing Richie Haven just opening up Woodstock,"
44:06;44:08;"like tearing his guitar in half."
44:08;44:10;"Like you feel like you could see blood"
44:10;44:12;"coming out of his throat."
44:12;44:14;"He's like tearing something"
44:14;44:17;"and delivering this just passionate rendition"
44:17;44:19;"of ""Motherless Child."""
44:19;44:21;"There was something about that."
44:21;44:23;"Seeing that is what got me excited about music."
44:23;44:26;"It was seeing that, seeing Joe Cocker"
44:26;44:30;"with his all-male band doing the female backup vocals."
44:30;44:33;"That's when I realized that maybe I can sing."
44:33;44:34;"Maybe I could do this,"
44:34;44:35;"'cause I always had a higher voice"
44:35;44:37;"and I always felt really self-conscious about singing."
44:37;44:39;"And it was seeing people like sing falsetto"
44:39;44:44;"and also backing up this complete psychopath in Joe Cocker."
44:44;44:50;"♪ What would you do if I sang out of tune ♪"
44:50;44:56;"♪ Would you stand up and walk out on me ♪"
44:56;45:02;"♪ Let me over ears and I'll sing you a song ♪"
45:02;45:09;"♪ I will try not to sing out of key ♪"
45:09;45:14;"♪ Oh baby how could I ♪"
45:14;45:19;"♪ Well I'm mad at my body ♪"
45:19;45:26;"♪ Oh baby I'll try, I'll try to wait ♪"
45:26;45:31;"♪ But I won't make it for my way ♪"
45:31;45:36;"- Well, so let's fast forward to current day"
45:36;45:39;"because on this show we always do the top five."
45:39;45:41;"And so your song ""Feel It Still"""
45:41;45:43;"has been in the top five quite a few times now."
45:43;45:44;"I think it's a great song."
45:44;45:47;"And also I've been kind of pointing out to people,"
45:47;45:49;"'cause not everybody always thinks about this,"
45:49;45:52;"that to actually have like a band,"
45:52;45:54;"I don't know how you guys define yourself,"
45:54;45:58;"but like, you know, left of center, alternative, whatever,"
45:58;46:02;"rarely in these days, not since the nineties,"
46:02;46:03;"ever crack like the top 10,"
46:03;46:06;"ever have what anybody would call like a hit song."
46:06;46:07;"I'm kind of curious."
46:07;46:09;"So when you started working on the song,"
46:09;46:12;"did you have a sense that you wanted Portugal the Man"
46:12;46:14;"to have quote unquote a hit,"
46:14;46:16;"or did that just seem so crazy"
46:16;46:17;"you couldn't even think about it?"
46:17;46:18;"How has this been?"
46:18;46:21;"- You probably approach music the same way we do,"
46:21;46:25;"which is I just want to write the best song I can."
46:25;46:27;"And we set out to do that."
46:27;46:29;"I mean, we worked with Mike D,"
46:29;46:31;"who by the way speaks very highly of you."
46:31;46:33;"- Oh, I appreciate that."
46:33;46:34;"Love Mike."
46:34;46:35;"- He's the best man."
46:35;46:40;"And working with him and Brian Danger Mouse, John Hill,"
46:40;46:43;"all of these people have always just pushed me"
46:43;46:45;"to try something more and do something better."
46:45;46:48;"And we wanted to write that song for sure,"
46:48;46:50;"but you can't predict that stuff."
46:50;46:53;"Like there's no way I could have written that song"
46:53;46:55;"if I sat down and said, you know what?"
46:55;46:57;"I'm going to write a number one song."
46:57;46:59;"Like I'm going to write a top five."
46:59;47:01;"You just can't do it."
47:01;47:03;"- I want to be in the top five on Time Crisis."
47:03;47:07;"Every musician's dream is to get there."
47:07;47:09;"- Yeah, Jimmy Frig, can I get on that for a show?"
47:09;47:12;"- I also think a lot about like with hit songs,"
47:12;47:15;"it's like a classic hindsight is 2020 thing."
47:15;47:18;"Like somebody could listen to your song,"
47:18;47:19;"Feel It Still Now, and be like,"
47:19;47:21;"well yeah, obviously that's a hit."
47:21;47:23;"It has all the hallmarks of a hit song."
47:23;47:26;"You know, like the number of elements happening"
47:26;47:26;"and the way the hook works."
47:26;47:28;"And it reminds me of this and that."
47:28;47:31;"But go back three years ago and play it for somebody"
47:31;47:34;"and say like, you think this is going to be top five"
47:34;47:37;"in between Chainsmokers songs in a few years?"
47:37;47:38;"You wouldn't think that."
47:38;47:40;"You don't sit down to write a song like that."
47:40;47:43;"And sometimes you're surprised which songs go the furthest."
47:43;47:45;"But so the first time we heard it,"
47:45;47:48;"Jake kind of recognized the Please Mr. Postman melody."
47:48;47:50;"And we saw that the people who wrote that song"
47:50;47:51;"have publishing on it."
47:51;47:53;"So we're kind of curious about how that came about"
47:53;47:57;"because on this show we talk a lot about how, you know,"
47:57;47:58;"sometimes somebody goes out of their way"
47:58;47:59;"to reference a song."
47:59;48:01;"And more often than not these days,"
48:01;48:04;"a song is written and somebody says,"
48:04;48:05;"that kind of reminds me of this other song."
48:05;48:07;"And then you have a lawsuit."
48:07;48:09;"So was this a preemptive thing?"
48:09;48:10;"Or when you started writing,"
48:10;48:12;"you're like, would it be cool to kind of reference"
48:12;48:14;"Please Mr. Postman in a different context?"
48:14;48:15;"Like what's the story with it?"
48:15;48:17;"- We set out to do that."
48:17;48:18;"I mean, that was the whole thing."
48:18;48:21;"Like when I sat down and started working on the song,"
48:21;48:23;"it really did come out of nowhere."
48:23;48:26;"We were mixing Live in the Moment with John Hill"
48:26;48:27;"in one room."
48:27;48:30;"And I kind of stepped into a side room"
48:30;48:32;"and Asa Taccone from Electric Guest."
48:32;48:34;"- Yeah, I didn't know Asa that."
48:34;48:35;"- He's a rad dude."
48:35;48:38;"And as you know, it gets always weird"
48:38;48:42;"if an outside, another artist steps in on your songwriting."
48:42;48:45;"But I just kind of stepped in the side room"
48:45;48:47;"and he was working on his own thing in one corner."
48:47;48:50;"And I just picked up this 1960s Hoffner"
48:50;48:52;"and started playing that bass line."
48:52;48:56;"And just immediately Asa kind of tilted his headphones back"
48:56;48:57;"and looked over and said,"
48:57;48:59;"""Yo Jay, you mind if I record that real quick?"""
48:59;49:02;"And I was kind of caught off guard by it, to be honest."
49:02;49:06;"Like it's just not a normal thing for artists to be so open"
49:06;49:08;"and just to kind of jump on it like that."
49:08;49:11;"And I let him record it and he asked if I had a bridge."
49:11;49:15;"I threw down the bass just for a bridge real quick."
49:15;49:18;"And everything just started happening really quickly."
49:18;49:23;"I had written that lyric with Mike actually five years ago."
49:23;49:25;"Sent out this lyric forever."
49:25;49:28;"And I'd used it a million times."
49:28;49:30;"And there was just something about the thump of the bass."
49:30;49:33;"It reminded me of those drives to town to get groceries."
49:33;49:35;"I mean, we'd have like two hour drives"
49:35;49:36;"to go get groceries sometimes."
49:36;49:39;"And just depending on where we live."
49:39;49:42;"And we would sing along with Mr. Postman."
49:42;49:44;"And we'd sing along with Motown and The Beatles."
49:44;49:46;"And there was just something about it"
49:46;49:48;"that was so immediate to me."
49:48;49:52;"And I sang that lyric, ""I'm a rebel just for kicks."""
49:52;49:54;"And then it just led me to 1966."
49:54;49:57;"And everything just kind of snowballed from there."
49:57;50:00;"I mean, every lyric led to the next."
50:00;50:04;"""Let me kick it like it's 1986"" was a Beastie Boys reference."
50:04;50:06;"I mean, I was kicking."
50:06;50:09;"The funniest thing about this is I said it to everybody"
50:09;50:10;"when I sent it in."
50:10;50:13;"I said, ""Hey, just so you know, this is Mr. Postman."""
50:13;50:16;"And everybody came back saying, ""No, it's not. You're cool."""
50:16;50:17;"- I can totally picture that."
50:17;50:18;"'Cause that's funny too."
50:18;50:20;"Sometimes when you're the artist,"
50:20;50:21;"you're trying to be extra sensitive"
50:21;50:22;"'cause to put yourself in the shoes"
50:22;50:24;"of like another songwriter,"
50:24;50:25;"you really want them to know"
50:25;50:27;"that you would never intentionally rip them off."
50:27;50:28;"And then you have other people being like,"
50:28;50:30;"""Wait, you're crazy."
50:30;50:32;"What, you're gonna give up some publishing"
50:32;50:33;"because it kind of, no, get it?"
50:33;50:35;"No, no, no, don't do it."""
50:35;50:37;"That's like so classic."
50:37;50:38;"- No, it's funny."
50:38;50:40;"It was like two weeks before the song came out,"
50:40;50:41;"we actually got hit."
50:41;50:43;"Like the musicologist called me up and said,"
50:43;50:44;"""Okay."""
50:44;50:46;"He was like walking me through exactly how"
50:46;50:49;"this is exactly Mr. Postman."
50:49;50:51;"The pacing, the time, everything about it."
50:51;50:52;"This is Mr. Postman."
50:52;50:54;"He's playing full back to me."
50:54;50:56;"And he gets done and I go, ""Yeah, I know."""
50:56;50:57;"- Yeah."
50:57;50:58;"- That was intentional."
50:58;51:01;"So you know, you have that scramble to try and clear it"
51:01;51:02;"before it comes out."
51:02;51:04;"And obviously they cleared it and everything was cool."
51:04;51:08;"But the thing that I loved about it was, it's that thing."
51:08;51:12;"It's that I get to sing this song for the rest of my life"
51:12;51:16;"that reminds me of those drives singing Mr. Postman"
51:16;51:17;"with my family."
51:17;51:19;"There's these like really great memories of us"
51:19;51:21;"just singing along in the car"
51:21;51:23;"and these long trips to go see my dad"
51:23;51:25;"when he's running the Yukon Quest."
51:25;51:28;"And it's just cool to share that stuff"
51:28;51:29;"with other generations."
51:29;51:31;"And it's something we've talked about it a million times."
51:31;51:34;"It's Keith Seeger and Woody Guthrie"
51:34;51:38;"traveling across the country writing folk songs"
51:38;51:41;"and learning a new folk song in Missoula"
51:41;51:43;"and taking it to Idaho Falls"
51:43;51:45;"and writing a new verse along the way."
51:45;51:46;"And it becomes their song."
51:46;51:48;"It becomes something a little bit different along the way."
51:48;51:49;"- No, totally."
51:49;51:52;"I mean, I always think to me that that,"
51:52;51:55;"I've done a lot of work that references other songs,"
51:55;51:57;"that inspiration, kind of do my own thing with it."
51:57;52:00;"But of course it's indebted to the other song"
52:00;52:03;"and I've done a lot of songs where another artist,"
52:03;52:05;"you kind of had to clear a sample, so to speak."
52:05;52:08;"And the truth is that there's,"
52:08;52:09;"sometimes people think that that's kind of"
52:09;52:11;"some new fangled hip hop way of doing things,"
52:11;52:13;"that it's like an aberration."
52:13;52:15;"It used to be people just sat down and wrote songs."
52:15;52:17;"Like no, the vast majority of human history"
52:17;52:20;"has been people using melodies as a way to remember stuff."
52:20;52:22;"You know how then when you think about like the Homer,"
52:22;52:24;"the Iliad was actually had a melody"
52:24;52:27;"or like the Bible has a melody,"
52:27;52:28;"you know, like the Old Testament, the Bible,"
52:28;52:30;"that you could sing the whole thing?"
52:30;52:33;"Because our brains work really well to like use melodies"
52:33;52:35;"to do your own thing with and to spin"
52:35;52:37;"and to every folk song, like you said,"
52:37;52:39;"is a million versions of it."
52:39;52:41;"So yeah, I love stories like that."
52:41;52:42;"I think it's super cool that there's like"
52:42;52:44;"a part of something from like your old memory"
52:44;52:46;"that's part of a new song and that,"
52:46;52:48;"and look, you know, millions of people"
52:48;52:50;"are hearing this song now."
52:50;52:54;"Maybe 80 to 90% of them just like the song,"
52:54;52:56;"but there's gonna be a sizable percentage of people"
52:56;52:58;"who are like, oh, I wonder like I see these other names"
52:58;53:00;"in the songwriting credits, who's that?"
53:00;53:02;"Like that's how I was when I was a kid."
53:02;53:03;"I learned a lot that way."
53:03;53:05;"- No, man, that's what's great about music."
53:05;53:07;"And I think that's what music should be."
53:07;53:10;"I mean, this was hip hop as well,"
53:10;53:13;"like where hip hop comes from just sampling records."
53:13;53:17;"And I love that idea of creating something new"
53:17;53:19;"with something that is so familiar to you"
53:19;53:21;"and something that means so much to you."
53:21;53:23;"I'm sure they're just sampling records that they love"
53:23;53:27;"and they get to rap over it and write a new chorus."
53:27;53:29;"And that should be how we share music."
53:29;53:30;"- Totally."
53:30;53:32;"And the one last thing that I'll say is also like,"
53:32;53:34;"you made something that's really connecting"
53:34;53:37;"with a lot of people that's deeply original too."
53:37;53:39;"And you know, you put a thousand people in a room"
53:39;53:40;"with ""Please Mr. Postman,"""
53:40;53:42;"they're not all gonna come out with your song."
53:42;53:45;"They're not all gonna write a ""Time Crisis"" top five song."
53:45;53:48;"So, you know, like as much as obviously"
53:48;53:50;"the song's indebted to that, you did your thing with it."
53:50;53:51;"And I think that's great."
53:51;53:52;"Well, John, we gotta wrap up."
53:52;53:54;"Thanks so much for calling in, man."
53:54;53:56;"I hope we cross paths in person in the future."
53:56;53:58;"And thanks for talking to us,"
53:58;54:01;"painting that beautiful portrait of your youth up in Alaska."
54:01;54:02;"- There you go."
54:02;54:03;"- All right, talk to you soon, man."
54:03;54:04;"Have a good rest of your tour."
54:04;54:05;"- Thanks, buddy."
54:05;54:06;"- All right, peace."
54:06;54:07;"- Thank you."

56:44;56:46;"First time on TC, what's up, Tim?"
56:46;56:48;"- First time listener."
56:48;56:49;"What's up?"
56:49;56:50;"Thanks for having me."
56:50;56:52;"- Our pleasure. - Big honor to be here."
56:52;56:53;"- You're also a radio host in a way."
56:53;56:58;"- Office Hours, it's a Facebook live stream call-in show"
56:58;57:01;"where people can call into my Skype."
57:01;57:03;"It's a little bit of a rip-off, I guess,"
57:03;57:06;"of Tom Sharpling's show or the Howard Stern show"
57:06;57:08;"or any other radio show."
57:08;57:10;"And then that gets turned into a podcast"
57:10;57:12;"after I do the live stream."
57:12;57:13;"- I wanna say one thing before we get in,"
57:13;57:15;"'cause we were talking about it."
57:15;57:16;"Sometimes you get people who call in the show"
57:16;57:20;"and they just say, ""Oh, I'm just a big fan."""
57:20;57:21;"And it kind of ruins the flow of the show."
57:21;57:24;"But I'm a big fan, and I was thinking about this,"
57:24;57:27;"'cause I've always been very interested in the year 2004."
57:27;57:28;"Have I ever talked about this on the show?"
57:28;57:30;"- No, I don't think so."
57:30;57:31;"- I've always had this weird theory."
57:31;57:32;"I don't have to go into detail,"
57:32;57:33;"but it's like there's a lot of weird connections"
57:33;57:36;"between '94 and 2004."
57:36;57:40;"So for instance, the first OutKast album came out in 1994,"
57:40;57:44;"and then in 2004, they won Album of the Year"
57:44;57:45;"for their final album."
57:45;57:48;"And a week later, Kanye's first album came out."
57:48;57:49;"So I've always been interested in things"
57:49;57:50;"that happened in 2004,"
57:50;57:53;"because a lot of things just come together."
57:53;57:54;"And I remember a lot of these things."
57:54;57:57;"I remember Kanye's first album coming out in 2004."
57:57;57:58;"That was a big deal for me."
57:58;58:01;"I remember Facebook launching in 2004"
58:01;58:04;"because it very quickly came to my school."
58:04;58:05;"And there's this weird thing."
58:05;58:07;"- You're like one of the first 500 users of Facebook?"
58:07;58:08;"- Yeah, I looked it up."
58:08;58:11;"I'm one of the first 5,000 people on Facebook."
58:11;58:13;"So recently I was thinking about it,"
58:13;58:16;"'cause I was wondering when Tom Goes to the Mayor came out."
58:16;58:19;"That was the first show you and Eric had on TV, right?"
58:19;58:20;"- Yeah."
58:20;58:21;"- 2004, right?"
58:21;58:22;"- Yeah."
58:22;58:23;"- So I'm just saying, in the year 2004,"
58:23;58:27;"George W. Bush is president, Iraq War is cooking."
58:27;58:29;"- It's spiraling out of control."
58:29;58:30;"- And I think three--"
58:30;58:31;"- It's starting to simmer out of control."
58:31;58:35;"- Yes, and three things that to me really changed culture,"
58:35;58:38;"Kanye's first album, Tim and Eric on TV,"
58:38;58:40;"and Facebook all came out in 2004."
58:40;58:41;"That's a big year."
58:41;58:42;"If we wanna go a step deeper,"
58:42;58:45;"I'll have to do this in maybe like a book format."
58:45;58:48;"I think we could then look at ways"
58:48;58:49;"in which Kanye changed culture,"
58:49;58:52;"Tim and Eric changed culture, and Facebook changed culture."
58:52;58:54;"Eventually those things--"
58:54;58:56;"- Gave us Donald Trump."
58:56;58:57;"- Take on a life of their own, and they start to intersect."
58:57;58:58;"I wasn't gonna say Trump,"
58:58;59:00;"but I bet you could make the case."
59:00;59:01;"- I guess so."
59:01;59:03;"Eric made some video for Kanye West,"
59:03;59:06;"and I'm on Facebook doing my office hours show."
59:06;59:07;"- That's right."
59:07;59:08;"- I think we've connected the dots."
59:08;59:09;"- Little did you know."
59:09;59:10;"- And you have Trump fans calling in."
59:10;59:13;"(rap music)"
59:59;01:00:08;"(rap music)"
01:00:08;01:00:13;"(rap music)"
01:00:13;01:00:19;"(rap music)"
01:00:19;01:00:24;"(rap music)"
01:00:24;01:00:27;"(rap music)"
01:00:27;01:00:32;"- Anyway, 2004 was a seminal year,"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"but now it's 2017."
01:00:33;01:00:35;"But I don't wanna just talk about that,"
01:00:35;01:00:35;"'cause I think--"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Let's not talk about the old days."
01:00:36;01:00:37;"- Let's not talk about the old days."
01:00:37;01:00:39;"So this is primarily a music show."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- Yes."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"- And increasingly baseball."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"- Oh, baseball, what are you,"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"I can't talk about baseball."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"- No, we're not over."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Baseball's over."
01:00:46;01:00:48;"- It was so, yeah, it drained me of everything."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"- But so, you got a new record coming out."
01:00:51;01:00:52;"This is not your first album."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"- In a weird way, it's like my seventh album."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"- Seventh record, so this is your Born in the USA."
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"- That was the seventh Bruce album."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"- Is that his seventh official?"
01:01:02;01:01:03;"- Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"his seventh official record."
01:01:05;01:01:09;"And then of course, all throughout your TV stuff,"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"there's always been original music and original songs."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"- I'm prolific in that sense."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"- One that made a big impression on me"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"was Petite Feet, Feminine Steps."
01:01:29;01:01:36;"♪ Petite Feet, Feminine Steps ♪"
01:01:36;01:01:39;"♪ Sounds like a lady when he's walking in the room ♪"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"♪ He's got Petite Feet, Feminine Steps ♪"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"♪ Sounds like a lady when he's walking in the room ♪"

01:02:19;01:02:26;"♪ But this is what the dude sounded like when he walked ♪"
01:02:26;01:02:29;"- But so take us back a little bit"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"before we talk about the new album."
01:02:32;01:02:32;"- Okay."
01:02:32;01:02:37;"- Before your young man growing up in Pennsylvania, right?"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"- Yeah, always had a band."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- Always had a band."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"- Had to have a band."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"I think that was the case for a lot of generally"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"creative people, whether you ended up making music"
01:02:47;01:02:51;"or if you were became a TV person or an actor"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"or a director or something."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"I bet a lot of people had bands"
01:02:54;01:02:57;"because it was a fraternal thing to do."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"It was a friendship thing to do."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"It was easy."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"It was relatively cheap."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"You weren't gonna make a movie."
01:03:03;01:03:06;"You weren't gonna make a virtual reality experience."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"(laughing)"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"You were gonna like get a PV base"
01:03:11;01:03:15;"and a Gorilla amp and write songs."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"What else could you do?"
01:03:16;01:03:19;"- This was like mid-90s PA."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"- Oh yeah, so actually Tim,"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"we were just talking about this before."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"What year did you start high school?"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"- I graduated in '94, so I started in '91."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"- And did you go straight to college after?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- Yeah."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- Did you graduate college?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"- Yep."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"- So you graduated college in '98?"
01:03:34;01:03:34;"- Yep."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"- Oh, so you have what we, a new phrase we have"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"on the show called a tight eight."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"(laughing)"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Where your entire eight years of high school"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"and the college was in one decade."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"- Oh, okay."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"- So Jake had that."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"You guys both had tight eights."
01:03:46;01:03:47;"- I'm like your behind you."
01:03:47;01:03:48;"- I was '90s."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Actually musically I had a big seminal year."
01:03:50;01:03:55;"I remember very distinctly my freshman year of college."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"Couple big records."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"- Your freshman year was '94?"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"- Yeah."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"- Cracked rear view, '94."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Who's that?"
01:04:03;01:04:03;"- You don't know Cracked Rear View?"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- I know, I can't remember."
01:04:05;01:04:05;"What is it?"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- I'll give you a hint."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"It's the 16th best selling album in US history."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"- Is it?"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"(laughing)"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"Is it, that helps."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"Alanis Morissette?"
01:04:14;01:04:14;"No."
01:04:14;01:04:15;"- Good guess."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"- No, that's a good guess."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"- Give me one more clue that's not chart related."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"- The kind of like syntax of the name"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"is something in the something."
01:04:23;01:04:23;"- Hootie and the Blowfish."
01:04:23;01:04:24;"- That's right."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"- I didn't like, I was cool enough"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"to not like Hootie and the Blowfish, okay?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I didn't care."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"- Oh, so you were a hipster."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"- Yeah, I was a big hipster."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"- What were your records in '94?"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- The Blue Album from Weezer."
01:04:35;01:04:36;"- Oh sure."
01:04:36;01:04:37;"- Huge, classic."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- I can picture driving down the road with that."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"- I was into the Pavement record, Crooked Rain."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"- Absolutely."
01:04:44;01:04:46;"- I think this was in more of senior year high school,"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"but it was like Smashing Pumpkins,"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Siamese Dreams, real big."
01:04:50;01:04:53;"There's another one that, Luna."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"I love that Luna record."
01:04:55;01:04:56;"- Oh, it's early Luna."
01:04:56;01:04:59;"- I was cool, I was a very cool music guy."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Alt-rock."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"- You're an alt-rock guy."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"- John Spencer, Blues Explosion."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- Oh wow."
01:05:04;01:05:05;"- I came back, yeah."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"- A lot of Matador records."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"- A lot of Matador, Yola Tango."
01:05:08;01:05:08;"- Oh yeah."
01:05:08;01:05:11;"- A lot of white guys, Ween."
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Ween, huge."
01:05:12;01:05:13;"- Yeah, of course."
01:05:13;01:05:14;"- Big."
01:05:14;01:05:15;"- Chocolate and Cheese."
01:06:02;01:06:29;"- So you had a very tight eight"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"with a major pivot right in the middle."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"- And then the next year, what, '95,"
01:06:34;01:06:35;"you get Radiohead, right?"
01:06:35;01:06:36;"You get--"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"- The Benz."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"- Okay, anyways, we're off topic."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"- So you were down with Smashing Pumpkins,"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"so you weren't too much of a snob."
01:06:43;01:06:47;"- I was really a big classic rock guy"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"when I was in high school."
01:06:49;01:06:52;"I was all about my Beatles, my Stones, my Zep,"
01:06:52;01:06:57;"my Hendrix, whatever was on the local classic rock station."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"But I heard Jimi Hendrix, Axis Bold is Love"
01:07:01;01:07:02;"in the Pumpkins."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"- For sure."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"- And I thought that was exciting."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"- One thing we talk about on the show a lot"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"is kind of the narcissism of small difference"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"and how when you're like a kid who's into something,"
01:07:12;01:07:16;"these different bands and vibes are huge to you."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"And then to the outside world,"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"they're like, this (beep) all sounds the same."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"And then even to kids down the line,"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"to imagine there's a time where like Pavement"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"and Smashing Pumpkins would have an ideological beef."
01:07:26;01:07:28;"- Right, I just heard that on the radio the other day."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"- Oh, you didn't know about that at the time."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"- Well, you knew about the line from the song"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"from Range Life where he says,"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"""Out on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins,"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"""nature kids, but they don't have no function."""
01:07:39;01:07:40;"I thought, well, what's that about?"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"I thought the Smashing Pumpkins were cool."
01:07:42;01:07:46;"Now this Pavement group is putting them in check."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"I'm thinking, uh-oh, I better start picking out my sides"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"here, you go with Pavement."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"- I had the exact same experience with that record."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"- I was starting to smell a rat with that--"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"- Corrigan. - With Billy Corrigan."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"He seems like an angry guy."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"But you know what's funny?"
01:08:01;01:08:04;"It's like, maybe this is all Stephen Malcomus' fault."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"It seemed like that criticism really affected him."
01:08:06;01:08:07;"- I don't remember at the time."
01:08:07;01:08:08;"- He was very angry about it,"
01:08:08;01:08:09;"'cause he had a quote where he said,"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"""You know what, nobody wakes up in the morning"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"""with a humming of Pavement's song."""
01:08:14;01:08:15;"He's basically trying to say that he was just like"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"a jealous (beep)."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"The point is, this idea that Pavement"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and Smashing Pumpkins are so, so different,"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"maybe different sensibilities of the singers,"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"but the music is so different,"
01:08:26;01:08:30;"whereas now, there's no music like that on the radio anyway,"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"so the idea that there'd be enough room"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"for both of those bands to really be making it done,"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"it's kinda funny."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"Do you remember this song?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"Did this mean anything to you?"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"- Oh, this was, is this the band Live?"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"No, Close. - No, Collective Soul."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- Collective Soul, yeah, they were always a joke."
01:08:46;01:08:49;"- This is, oh, so in 1994, you heard this,"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"and it was like, sucks. - Yeah, yeah."

01:13:17;01:13:18;"that I remember going to school."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"It was just like, okay. - So '90s."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"- But it is, the way she sings, the way the chorus,"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"it's very much a novelty song."

01:14:23;01:14:26;"- Yeah, and she went on to be a major producer, right?"

01:14:40;01:14:43;"I just wanna say also, it's really easy"
01:14:43;01:14:47;"to make fun of songs that kind of just earnestly say,"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"something's happening around here."
01:14:48;01:14:51;"What it is ain't clear, or also the song to say,"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"what's going on?"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"But like--"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"- After Marvin Gaye already asked the question."
01:14:55;01:14:58;"- Okay, yeah, I guess when you put it that way,"
01:14:58;01:14:59;"oh, you know what, I just realized,"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"that's why this ""Four Non Blondes"" song"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"is not called ""What's Going On,"" it's called ""What's Up?"""
01:15:03;01:15:04;"(laughing)"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"'Cause they couldn't probably, they thought--"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"- They didn't have the right to say what's going on."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"- It wasn't a wise move to call it ""What's Going On."""
01:15:09;01:15:12;"But you know, on a basic level, it's very human,"
01:15:12;01:15:14;"just to say like, you don't have to pretend"
01:15:14;01:15:15;"you have the answer, sometimes all you do"
01:15:15;01:15:18;"is just write a catchy song and say, what's going on?"
01:15:18;01:15:21;"- I remember hearing that every morning in the car"
01:15:21;01:15:25;"going to school and being so mad at my local rock station"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"for playing it."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"I think 'cause I was mad, I think 'cause it was a woman."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"- Oh really? - To be honest with you."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"- You were a sexist rock fan?"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"- I think it was like, come on man, where's Robert Plant?"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"(laughing)"
01:15:35;01:15:36;"I've changed my position."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"- So you weren't a Hole fan?"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"- No, probably not."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"I wasn't a big Nirvana fan, actually."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"- Interesting."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"- So do you feel like in a weird way,"
01:15:43;01:15:47;"having been a disaffected white kid,"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"albeit in the early 90s,"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"used to call the local rock station and say--"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"- Complain when they're playing."
01:15:51;01:15:54;"I remember they had a vote, I'm not kidding about that,"
01:15:54;01:15:57;"they had a vote on the classic rock station"
01:15:57;01:16:00;"whether to play the Sinéad O'Connor song."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"- Nothing Compares to You. - Nothing Compares to You."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"- Incredible song."
01:16:02;01:16:06;"- Yeah, that's an unbelievable song."
01:16:06;01:16:08;"And some other rock song that was,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"maybe it was Bon Jovi or some (beep) that."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Which should we choose?"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"And I called up, how dare you even consider"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"playing that Sinéad O'Connor?"
01:16:16;01:16:16;"- Oh, (beep) yeah."
01:16:16;01:16:21;"♪ I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant ♪"
01:16:21;01:16:29;"♪ But nothing, I said nothing can take away this blues ♪"
01:16:29;01:16:37;"♪ 'Cause nothing compares ♪"
01:16:37;01:16:40;"♪ Nothing compares to you ♪"
01:16:40;01:16:48;"- As a young kid, you had a misogynist streak in rock--"
01:16:48;01:16:52;"- Misogynist, I was probably more aligned"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"with George Bush, who was senior,"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"than I would have been with Bill Clinton."
01:16:56;01:17:01;"I was born in a Republican house with a conservative family."
01:17:01;01:17:05;"I was artistic and creative and I had friends who were gay"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"and I had that going on, but I think,"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"I think I was already breaking out of that--"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"- Right, so it was a transitional period."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"- But there was certainly like earlier in high school."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"- So do you feel like with these alt-right kids,"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"they've called into your show and stuff."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Do you feel like you understand them better than most?"
01:17:21;01:17:25;"- I think I probably do, and I think I don't let it"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"get me too upset because I know a lot of them"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"are just gonna plain grow out of it."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"And a lot of them will just go to college"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"or they'll go get a job and they'll discover"
01:17:36;01:17:40;"more people in the world and just mellow out"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"and become a little more empathetic or a little more--"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"- So what was your journey to mellowing out?"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"- I grew up in Allentown, Pennsylvania,"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"which is a very small town outside of Philadelphia."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"Not that small, but it was small enough"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"that I didn't really know anybody that didn't look like me."
01:17:54;01:17:57;"And I went to Temple University in North Philly,"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"which is about the biggest dichotomy"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"you can imagine of environments."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"It was the ghetto of Philadelphia."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"So, and I was exposed to all kinds of different people"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"that I didn't grow up around and stuff."
01:18:09;01:18:11;"So, and then they took, listen, college,"
01:18:11;01:18:15;"they're not kidding about like college liberalizing you."
01:18:15;01:18:17;"'Cause I took classes where they gave you"
01:18:17;01:18:19;"the Howard Zinn books to read and everything"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"and exposed you to multiculturalism"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"and all kinds of stuff like that."
01:18:23;01:18:26;"And I think it's a positive thing, but it's,"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"you know, there is that--"
01:18:27;01:18:30;"- So you're a case study of a kid"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"going down the wrong path,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"went to college, took one gender studies course"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"and finally realized Sinead O'Connor's good."
01:18:36;01:18:39;"- Yeah, yeah, I took a lot of those."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"I took those, 'cause those were the easy classes."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"- Oh, okay."
01:18:42;01:18:43;"(laughing)"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"I got a question for you."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Are you a communist?"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"- No."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"- Socialist?"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"- No, I don't think so."
01:18:49;01:18:50;"- I've just always been--"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"- I don't really understand what I am."
01:18:52;01:18:57;"I'm socially liberal, fiscally,"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"I wouldn't say conservative,"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"but you feel like you wanna be smart"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"with the money that we have?"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"(laughing)"
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Try to spend it wisely?"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"- I hear you, man."
01:19:08;01:19:09;"- I don't know."
01:19:09;01:19:10;"- I just think, in a funny way,"
01:19:10;01:19:13;"like the stuff you've done on TV,"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"I think I've seen people make the case"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"that Tim and Eric sometimes seems"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"like a critique of capitalism."
01:19:18;01:19:21;"- Definitely the commercialism,"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"which is tied into capitalism,"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"but sort of the craven commercialism"
01:19:25;01:19:29;"of late night infomercials and stuff like that"
01:19:29;01:19:32;"and just the, there's certainly elements of that."
01:19:32;01:19:36;"But I do think I can be easily persuaded into socialism."
01:19:36;01:19:40;"I think the bigger macro issues coming our way,"
01:19:40;01:19:44;"like a tsunami of the automation"
01:19:44;01:19:47;"and the fundamental changes in the way"
01:19:47;01:19:50;"that people are expected to work and earn livings"
01:19:50;01:19:54;"is gonna force us into some kind of socialist system."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"- Something's gonna change."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"- Because you just, what are these guys"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"that built trucks supposed to do"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"when they don't need to be building trucks anymore?"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"I don't know, no one's given an answer for that."
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Or not even build trucks, drive trucks."
01:20:05;01:20:06;"- Yeah."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"- Or put gas in the trucks or clean them."
01:20:09;01:20:12;"I mean, it's all gonna be automated in 20 years."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"And also chipping away at this concept"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"of work being something that somebody wants to do."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Like work sucks."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"We hate work."
01:20:20;01:20:20;"- I know."
01:20:20;01:20:22;"- I hate work, man."
01:20:22;01:20:25;"Jobs, like manual labor, repetitive labor,"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"it's very unhealthy, it's bad."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"It doesn't provide any satisfaction to the person."
01:20:29;01:20:33;"So you have to create other things in that person's life"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"to give them satisfaction."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"You have to create sports teams to root for"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"and you have to do all this stuff to fill in those gaps."
01:20:39;01:20:41;"So when all that stuff gets torn down"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"in the next quarter century,"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"there's gonna be some big questions that need to be answered."

01:22:36;01:22:39;"- Well, it's just a collection of songs"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"that I've put out this year."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"I think last year,"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"once the election of Donald Trump happened,"
01:22:45;01:22:46;"I think a little bit before that,"
01:22:46;01:22:49;"when he was running and the election was going on,"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"I would kind of freak out."
01:22:51;01:22:55;"And I did what I would often do in other times of my life."
01:22:55;01:22:58;"I'd kind of go down to my garage and play piano"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"and sing about it."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"And some of the songs seemed to,"
01:23:02;01:23:03;"I liked them."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I liked what came out of me."
01:23:05;01:23:09;"And so I'd put them out on my website, on Bandcamp."
01:23:09;01:23:12;"And the more I did it, the more people liked it,"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"the more I felt encouraged to keep doing it."
01:23:14;01:23:16;"And so throughout the year,"
01:23:16;01:23:17;"when an idea came to me,"
01:23:17;01:23:18;"I would put it out."
01:23:18;01:23:21;"It was fun to put something out on a Friday night"
01:23:21;01:23:25;"and then all these music sites just picked up on them"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"and Pitchfork and everybody's like,"
01:23:27;01:23:29;"""He's released another one."""
01:23:29;01:23:31;"I released this Richard Spencer song"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"the day after he got punched."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"And I had this little two minute,"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"I mean, it's a real little ditty."
01:23:37;01:23:38;"It's just this two minute little song"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"about punching Richard Spencer."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"And I put it out on a Saturday night."
01:23:43;01:23:46;"I just said that there was a song on my page."
01:23:46;01:23:49;"It was everywhere the next day, like on all those blogs."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"And I didn't promote it very much."
01:23:51;01:23:53;"I just kind of let it lay out there."
01:23:53;01:23:56;"So those built up to enough where my label,"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Jag Jaguar was like,"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"""We should put these out in a real way."""
01:24:00;01:24:02;"'Cause they're all just kind of spread out."
01:24:02;01:24:06;"And so they mastered it and made a nice album cover for it."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"- Friend of the show, Eric Yonker did the cover."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- Oh, is he a friend of the show?"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- Yeah, yeah, he's been on before."

01:24:18;01:24:20;"that you want cool things to be."
01:24:20;01:24:21;"- Yeah."
01:24:21;01:24:24;"- So I got a lot of reaction."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"A lot of people like it."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"A lot of people think it's very lame"
01:24:27;01:24:31;"to be making fun of Trump because it's a low hanging fruit."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"- One thing that we've always been interested in"
01:24:33;01:24:36;"on this show is, and me personally, is like tone."
01:24:36;01:24:42;"And I think as somebody who's kind of known as a comedian,"
01:24:42;01:24:47;"but even your comedy has a lot of different tones."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"It's interesting, with your music career,"
01:24:49;01:24:52;"there's a lot of people known for comedy who go into music"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"and it's like comedy albums."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Like your classic Adam Sandler thing."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"Adam Sandler in the 90s."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"- Novelty songs."
01:24:59;01:25:02;"- By the way, sold more records than a lot of rock bands."
01:25:02;01:25:03;"I looked it up."
01:25:03;01:25:04;"He's like, I think each of his albums"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"is like four times platinum."
01:25:06;01:25:09;"Adam Sandler probably sold more records"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"than Collective Soul."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"(explosion)"
01:25:12;01:25:15;"Just when we're thinking about the 90s."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"But you're somebody who like,"
01:25:16;01:25:19;"you make some songs that are obviously funny."
01:25:19;01:25:21;"And then you make songs that are"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"not straightforwardly comedy songs."
01:25:22;01:25:26;"You also have more musicianship and kind of love for music"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"than some like straight up comedy people."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"Like where does this album fall on the spectrum"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"of like your music and the tone of your music?"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"- There's definitely funny songs."
01:25:35;01:25:38;"I think Mar-a-Lago's a funny song."
01:25:38;01:25:41;"There's funny ideas and there's really sad,"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"tragic ideas in it."
01:25:42;01:25:45;"And my hero when it comes to songwriting"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"has always been Randy Newman."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"And I got really deep into Randy Newman"
01:25:49;01:25:51;"four or five years ago."
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Dug into his 70s records,"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"a record called Good Old Boys in particular,"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"which is a perfect album in my opinion."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"It's a 10 if I was writing for Pitchfork."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"- Maybe they'll let you do a guest review."
01:26:05;01:26:09;"- And it vacillates between sort of satirical,"
01:26:09;01:26:14;"political commentary and then terribly sad songs"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"and very, very funny songs."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"And musically it's the best."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"It's just so beautifully made."
01:26:22;01:26:24;"So that inspires me to,"
01:26:24;01:26:27;"if I have a funny line or a funny perspective on something"
01:26:27;01:26:28;"to pursue that."
01:26:28;01:26:31;"But this song on the record called Wilbur Ross,"
01:26:31;01:26:35;"who Wilbur Ross is Trump's commerce secretary, I think."
01:26:35;01:26:36;"And he looks like a turtle."
01:26:36;01:26:38;"He looks like a turtle."
01:26:38;01:26:40;"And where I grew up in Allentown,"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"the neighboring town is Bethlehem"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"and Bethlehem Steel was a big--"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- Right, yeah, famously."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"- And one of the things we learned about Wilbur Ross"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"is back in the 80s,"
01:26:48;01:26:53;"he basically bought Bethlehem Steel and sold it for scrap."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"He like just decimated the town."
01:26:55;01:26:56;"So there's a very personal,"
01:26:56;01:26:59;"hurtful feeling towards people like that."
01:26:59;01:27:01;"But I did learn something about him"
01:27:01;01:27:03;"that he wears these slippers that are embroidered"
01:27:03;01:27:05;"with the Department of Commerce."
01:27:05;01:27:08;"And he has this like collection of $500 slippers."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"That's the only shoes he wears."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"So that's absurd."
01:27:12;01:27:15;"And so the first line in the song is Wilbur Ross"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"puts his slippers on, just like all of us, $500 at a time."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I don't see what's all the fuss."
01:27:21;01:27:24;"So that's kind of a funny line."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"But then the second verse,"
01:27:25;01:27:29;"I go into the point of view of like a West Virginia miner"
01:27:29;01:27:33;"whose sister is on heroin."
01:27:33;01:27:37;"And I just went for it as like a real lyric"
01:27:37;01:27:40;"about real people that I see on TV."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"- Right."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"- And that I probably would know"
01:27:42;01:27:45;"if I was still living in Allentown."
01:27:45;01:27:50;"That's absolutely and totally intentionally sincere"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"about what these people are like"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"and what they expect of people like Wilbur Ross"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"to do for them and how they're disappointed in them."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"And so I'm proud of like the fact that you can go"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"from the two different levels"
01:28:01;01:28:05;"of funny little one-liners to some serious subject matter."
01:28:05;01:28:06;"- It wouldn't tell the whole story"
01:28:06;01:28:09;"to call it a political comedy album."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"- You can shorthand it that way, fine."
01:28:11;01:28:12;"- Sure."
01:28:12;01:28:12;"- Yeah."
01:28:12;01:28:13;"- But there's more to it."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You're not gonna fight that."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"But so we have to ask you,"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"because on this show from day one,"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"we've always talked about Billy Joel a lot."
01:28:22;01:28:27;"And of course, nationally, your hometown."
01:28:27;01:28:27;"- I'm the expert."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"- Was really, for a lot of people,"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"they heard about it with the song ""Allentown."""
01:28:31;01:28:32;"- Great song."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"- As an Allentown native, what do you think of that song?"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"- It connected to what I just said about Wilbur Ross."
01:28:38;01:28:40;"It should have been, ""I'm living here in Bethlehem."""
01:28:40;01:28:42;"But I understand why you didn't do that."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"'Cause that's the word Bethlehem--"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"- 'Cause of the emphasis on the syllable."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"- That and that the--"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"- Then they think it's a Christmas song."
01:28:48;01:28:50;"- The rest of the world, it's a Christmas song, yeah."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"So, but Bethlehem was truly--"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"- Billy Joel is an international artist."
01:28:53;01:28:55;"He can't have that kind of confusion."
01:28:55;01:28:57;"Is Allentown not considered a steel town?"
01:28:57;01:29:01;"- No, but it's really right next to Bethlehem."
01:29:01;01:29:04;"So I'm sure people lived in both areas."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"- You never encountered any Allentown resistance"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"to the fact, like, ""Why is this guy writing a song"
01:29:08;01:29:09;"about art?"" - There was a little bit"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"of that."
01:29:10;01:29:12;"I remember there being a little, ""What does he know?"""
01:29:12;01:29:14;"First of all, he's from New York."
01:29:14;01:29:17;"He's a big pop star with a model wife."
01:29:17;01:29:18;"You know, Christie Brinkley, right?"
01:29:18;01:29:19;"- Right, the ""Uptown Girl"" herself."
01:29:19;01:29:20;"- ""Uptown Girl"" song."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"- He got his ""Uptown Girl."""
01:29:21;01:29:23;"He forgot about the downtown."
01:29:23;01:29:25;"- There was a little bit of like,"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"and I think in general, probably,"
01:29:27;01:29:28;"what does this guy think he's,"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"and also, what are you, Bruce Springsteen?"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"- Well, yeah, obviously he was trying"
01:29:31;01:29:33;"to keep up with Springsteen at that moment."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"- But looking back on it,"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"it's a pretty crafty little song."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"- Yeah."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Somebody, who was it that told me recently"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"that they saw Billy Joel at a massive concert,"
01:29:43;01:29:46;"'cause he's been doing kind of like a stadium tour,"
01:29:46;01:29:49;"and they said that when he plays Allentown,"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"it has an infamous beginning."
01:29:50;01:29:53;"(imitates drum roll)"
01:29:53;01:29:55;"- That's pretty."
01:29:55;01:29:56;"(drums beating)"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"- And then it kicks in."
01:29:58;01:29:59;"So somebody told me that when,"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"they saw him sometime recently,"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"and you know, it's Billy Joel's,"
01:30:03;01:30:05;"it's like big razzle-dazzle production,"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"but he's also still this kind of like funny, sarcastic dude."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"So it's time for Allentown,"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"and like the lights go out in the stadium,"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"and like some big smokestacks are on stage,"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"and then just like you hear,"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"(imitates steam)"
01:30:19;01:30:22;"and then there's just like real steam coming out,"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"and like crazy lights. - Oh my God."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"- Like he momentarily turns into a factory,"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"the drums kick in,"
01:30:27;01:30:30;"and he's like, ""Stop, stop, stop!"""
01:30:30;01:30:32;"And he's like, ""I'm sorry, we (beep) up."""
01:30:32;01:30:34;"And then they kind of turn the lights back on,"
01:30:34;01:30:35;"and he's like, ""Should we take it from the top?"""
01:30:35;01:30:36;"And they're like, ""Yeah."""
01:30:36;01:30:37;"And of course all this stuff is programmed,"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"you got the dude doing the lights and stuff,"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"then they like take it from the top,"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"the lights go back out again,"
01:30:42;01:30:44;"and then it's like this whole production again,"
01:30:44;01:30:46;"of just like this steam coming out,"
01:30:46;01:30:48;"and then they kick into it."

01:37:50;01:37:52;"is a guy who loves classic rock"

01:37:55;01:37:57;"- Well, no, it's Post Malone."
01:37:57;01:37:57;"You know who that is?"
01:37:57;01:37:58;"- Who?"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"- Post Malone."
01:37:59;01:38:00;"- No, is that real?"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"I've never heard Post Malone."
01:38:01;01:38:03;"- That's funny, now Jake is more familiar with this music."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"Normally Jake's the one who doesn't know anything."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"- Yeah, this is usually my role."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"- Yeah, so Jake, you remember--"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"- Post Malone, I swear to God, I've never heard that before."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"- You've never heard the name Post Malone?"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"- No."
01:38:12;01:38:13;"- Okay, he's--"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"- I've heard Free Malone."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"- He's relatively new on the scene."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"This song's featuring 21 Savage."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"(laughing)"
01:38:20;01:38:21;"Okay, I'm not even gonna ask anymore."
01:38:21;01:38:22;"- You really don't."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"- But I think you might--"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"- I'm not trying to do a bet here."
01:38:25;01:38:26;"I'm really-- - Okay, all right, cool."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"No, no, being straightforward."
01:38:27;01:38:31;"But you might like this song because guess what it's called?"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"Rockstar."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"- Okay."
01:38:33;01:38:34;"- Just so you know, this is one of the biggest songs"
01:38:34;01:38:35;"in America for the past few weeks."
01:38:35;01:38:38;"- Oh my God, am I gonna jump off a bridge after this?"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"- Doubt it."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"(soft music)"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"- Post Malone."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"(laughing)"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"- So much production going into this."
01:38:51;01:38:54;"(soft music)"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"(laughing)"
01:38:56;01:39:00;"- Oh no."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- You have no context for this music."
01:39:01;01:39:04;"(soft music)"
01:39:04;01:39:16;"- It almost reminds me a little bit--"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"- I mean, it's melodic."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"You can't say it's not melodic."
01:39:18;01:39:20;"- It's got a little Floyd in it, don't you think?"
01:39:20;01:39:21;"A little like--"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"(laughing)"
01:39:22;01:39:23;"- It's a little us and them."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"- It's psychedelic in its way."
01:39:24;01:39:28;"- Yeah, a little shine on you crazy diamond."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"- I can see that."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"This guy, Post Malone, I like him."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"- Do you think I could, with the right producer,"
01:39:33;01:39:35;"make this kind of music pretty easily?"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Or do you think it's not so easy?"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"- Well--"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"- Obviously I've got a terrific sense of melody"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"and song structure."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"I have a point of view."
01:39:43;01:39:43;"- Well, here's the thing."
01:39:43;01:39:45;"- Could you take one of my songs"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"and sort of meld it into this kind of sound?"
01:39:48;01:39:49;"- This type of music, it's like anything."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"The same way that somebody could listen to rock music"
01:39:51;01:39:53;"and say, ""Hey, just get a guitar, bass, drums."""
01:39:53;01:39:54;"It's easy."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"But I'm saying, with this type of music,"
01:39:56;01:40:00;"yes, you could go download some instrumentals off YouTube."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"There literally have been hit songs that were made that way."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Somebody downloaded something that's like Trap Beat 4"
01:40:04;01:40:05;"and it becomes a hit."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"So you could find the beat."
01:40:07;01:40:10;"You got Auto-Tune in your Pro Tools."
01:40:10;01:40:10;"Okay, so you--"
01:40:10;01:40:11;"- Logic."
01:40:11;01:40:12;"- Oh, in your Logic, okay."
01:40:12;01:40:13;"So you use some Auto-Tune."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"You could get the vocal sound very easily."
01:40:15;01:40:17;"So these are open secrets."
01:40:17;01:40:19;"It's not hard to get that vocal sound."
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Post Malone, it's not like he's the only guy doing this."
01:40:21;01:40:25;"There's hundreds of thousands of kids on SoundCloud"
01:40:25;01:40:26;"making songs like this."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"I bet you could make something that sounded"
01:40:28;01:40:31;"professional rap song very quickly."
01:40:31;01:40:32;"- Yeah."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"- Could you make one that was a huge hit?"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"That's the hard part."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"- That's always the big question."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"- And I think you should try."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"- I don't want to."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"- You've been--"
01:40:40;01:40:41;"- I don't want to try."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"(laughing)"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"- Well, do you appreciate that that song"
01:40:44;01:40:45;"is called ""Rockstar"" as a rock fan?"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"That seems pretty first draft to me."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"(laughing)"
01:40:48;01:40:49;"- Really?"
01:40:49;01:40:51;"- Call it ""Rockstar,"" it doesn't matter."
01:40:51;01:40:52;"How long did that take for Post Malone"
01:40:52;01:40:54;"to come up with ""Rockstar""?"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"He's looking at that 20 ounce bottle of energy drink"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"he was drinking at the time."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"- Post Malone's a very interesting guy."
01:41:00;01:41:01;"- Okay, I'll look into him more."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"- Look into Post Malone."
01:41:02;01:41:03;"- Post Malone."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"- And also look into Migos."
01:41:04;01:41:05;"I think there are Migos songs you'd like."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"- Okay."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"- Well, we'll see."
01:41:09;01:41:10;"We'll make you, I'm gonna make you--"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"- You got any Joni Mitchell coming up?"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"- Joni's got a new album coming out."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"- Oh, really?"
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- The single's a big hit, no."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"(laughing)"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"The number three song, Camila Cabello."
01:41:22;01:41:22;"- I don't know who she is."
01:41:22;01:41:25;"- Do you know who Fifth Harmony is?"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"- Yes, I think so."
01:41:27;01:41:28;"- Maybe your daughter's--"
01:41:28;01:41:29;"- I had, you know what's funny about them"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"is my ""In Glendale"" album, the single on that record"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"was called ""Work From Home."""
01:41:34;01:41:34;"- Oh, and they had the song--"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"- And they had a song called ""Work From Home."""
01:41:36;01:41:38;"And it came out like the same week,"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"and it was very annoying."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Maybe I got some sales off of accidental--"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"(laughing)"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"- Who knows, it was a blessing in disguise."
01:41:45;01:41:48;"Camila Cabello used to be a member of Fifth Harmony."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"And this is her song ""Havana,"""
01:41:51;01:41:53;"which has been staying pretty strong in the top five,"
01:41:53;01:41:54;"featuring Young Thug."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"There's that piano that you wanted."

01:42:40;01:42:42;"- It's familiar, I guess. - You like to be surprised?"
01:42:42;01:42:44;"- It's all right."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"It reminds me of that Collective Soul song"
01:42:46;01:42:48;"where it kinda plods along."
01:42:48;01:42:53;"- Cabello Cabello's a big Collective Soul fan."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"So, okay, so it seemed like the first two songs,"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"you're not up on new rap music."
01:42:58;01:42:59;"- It's a little disoriented."
01:42:59;01:43:01;"- But so, are you the type of person"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"because you love acoustic analog stuff so much,"
01:43:05;01:43:07;"as soon as you hear that real sounding piano,"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"you're more engaged?"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"- I'm intrigued."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"I can visually see the instrument."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"I can connect to it. - Okay, well, it's interesting."
01:43:13;01:43:15;"Actually, we've been getting,"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"as we go on to the number two song on this week's Top 5,"
01:43:19;01:43:22;"we've been getting progressively more organic."
01:43:22;01:43:26;"'Cause we started, Motorsport and Rockstar are totally,"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"you know, beats are electronic music,"
01:43:28;01:43:30;"the only organic thing's the vocal."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Havana's somewhere in between."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"And this guy, this guy gets on stage"
01:43:34;01:43:37;"in front of thousands and thousands of people,"
01:43:37;01:43:38;"just his voice and his guitar."
01:43:38;01:43:39;"- Sheeran."
01:43:39;01:43:40;"- That's right."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"- I know him."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"- Because you're a fan?"
01:43:43;01:43:43;"- No."
01:43:43;01:43:45;"(laughing)"
01:43:45;01:43:46;"- You know him socially?"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"- No, I just know that I've seen him."
01:43:48;01:43:51;"He's big enough that he comes into my little circle."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"- So, as somebody who vaguely knows about Sheeran,"
01:43:53;01:43:54;"who is he to you?"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"What does he represent?"
01:43:55;01:43:58;"- You know, I think he's got a little too much"
01:43:58;01:44:03;"of that post-American Idol show-off vocal acrobatics"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"that I don't like."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"Well, let's hear the song."
01:44:06;01:44:06;"I think I've heard this song."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"- 'Cause on paper, his palette is not that different"
01:44:08;01:44:11;"than some, you know, Joni Mitchell blue."
01:44:11;01:44:15;"- Well, that, I mean, that's a big--"

01:47:08;01:47:11;"- He's on, like, every episode."
01:47:11;01:47:13;"- He writes songs for other people, too?"
01:47:13;01:47:16;"- Yes, he's written songs for Justin Bieber."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"I don't know if he's written a song for Migos,"
01:47:17;01:47:20;"but he's a massive songwriter."

01:47:32;01:47:34;"- And he, you know, he sometimes has little surprises"
01:47:34;01:47:35;"in the lyrics, so you might be surprised."
01:47:35;01:47:37;"- Jeff Tweedy has a nice career going."
01:47:37;01:47:39;"- No, it's not even at the same level."
01:47:39;01:47:40;"(laughing)"
01:47:40;01:47:41;"Ed, Ed Sheeran."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"- We'll see if Ed Sheeran goes for 20 years."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"- He will."
01:47:44;01:47:47;"Ed Sheeran sells out Wembley Stadium."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"- Or the Morongo Casino in 20 years."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"- Ed Sheeran sells out stadiums,"
01:47:50;01:47:50;"just him and an acoustic guitar."
01:47:50;01:47:53;"- But you know, it's funny, 'cause like,"
01:47:53;01:47:55;"if you look back to the '70s, the pop stars"
01:47:55;01:48:00;"of all those eras, save a few that become legendary,"
01:48:00;01:48:03;"they do get forgotten quickly."
01:48:03;01:48:04;"- Well, like the one hit wonders."
01:48:04;01:48:06;"- Ed Gilbert, Humphrey Dink, and Barry Manilow."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Yeah, the one hit one."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"- Barry Manilow's still kicking."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"- Well, but he's, I mean."
01:48:11;01:48:13;"- I'm sure he's got a gorgeous home in Bel Air."
01:48:13;01:48:15;"- I'm sure that's where Ed will be."
01:48:15;01:48:16;"- Probably throwing sick parties."
01:48:16;01:48:19;"- Okay, so let's just look at some of,"
01:48:19;01:48:22;"this song is not as interesting as his last hit,"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"that he painted a very interesting portrait."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"It was called ""Shape of You."""
01:48:26;01:48:28;"♪ I'm in love with the shape of you ♪"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"- Is that Ed Sheeran too?"
01:48:29;01:48:30;"- Yeah, you know the song?"
01:48:30;01:48:31;"- So he's number one and two?"
01:48:31;01:48:33;"- No, no, that was his last hit."
01:48:33;01:48:35;"- Yeah, I saw him perform that at like the Grammys"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"or something a couple years ago."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"- Yes, that was a huge song."
01:48:37;01:48:38;"That was interesting."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"He talks about having Chinese food with the girl,"
01:48:40;01:48:41;"all this stuff."
01:48:41;01:48:42;"So let's just look at this stanza,"
01:48:42;01:48:45;"the one question that you think was ripping off Bruce."
01:48:45;01:48:49;"""Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms."""
01:48:49;01:48:50;"Okay, so right there, that's a huge difference"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"'cause ""Dancing in the Dark"" is about a guy"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"who's like by himself looking in the mirror,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"just like alone in his apartment."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Yeah, Bruce's song is about like some weirdo,"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"creepy dude alone in his bedroom."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"- ""Sitting here trying to write this book,"" he says."
01:49:02;01:49:03;"The weirdest line in the music."
01:49:03;01:49:03;"- Oh, he says book?"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"- Yeah."
01:49:04;01:49:07;"""I'm sitting here trying to write this book."""
01:49:07;01:49:09;"- So that song's about some creepy dude"
01:49:09;01:49:11;"who's just trying to make a case for a girl."
01:49:11;01:49:11;"He's like alone in his bedroom."
01:49:11;01:49:14;"- ""I'm gonna change my hair, my clothes, my face."""
01:49:14;01:49:16;"- What kind of message is that for people?"
01:49:16;01:49:17;"You should be happy the way you look."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"Anyway, Ed Sheeran is, ""I'm dancing in the dark"
01:49:19;01:49:21;"""with you between my arms,"" much more romantic."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"- He's full of romance."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"The girls love it, girls buy music, I get it."
01:49:25;01:49:27;"- What, men are not romantic?"
01:49:27;01:49:29;"- Nah, men got too much stuff on their plate."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"(laughing)"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Too busy."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"They're romantic, they're not buying music."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"They're buying video games."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"- Ed has many male fans, Tim, you might be surprised."
01:49:38;01:49:40;"So Ed says, ""Baby, I'm dancing in the dark"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"""with you between my arms."""
01:49:42;01:49:45;"Barefoot on the grass is how he says it,"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"listening to our favorite song."
01:49:46;01:49:48;"- He looks like that Prince Harry."
01:49:48;01:49:50;"- Yeah, they're both like British gingers."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"- I like this."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"- Okay, so listen, this is where he turns it around."
01:49:53;01:49:55;"""When you said you looked a mess,"
01:49:55;01:49:59;"""I whispered underneath my breath, but you heard it."

01:50:02;01:50:03;"- Yeah."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"- So there's some interesting internal rhyme there."
01:50:05;01:50:06;"""When you said you looked a mess,"
01:50:06;01:50:09;"""I whispered underneath my breath, but you heard it."

01:50:11;01:50:12;"It's-- - Interesting."
01:50:12;01:50:14;"- So now we understand what's happening in the song."
01:50:14;01:50:16;"So now that we've kind of gone a little deeper,"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"do you like the song better?"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"This is a guy with a girl of low self-esteem."
01:50:20;01:50:23;"She said, ""I look terrible."""
01:50:23;01:50:24;"And then for whatever reason,"
01:50:24;01:50:25;"he doesn't want to say it directly to her,"
01:50:25;01:50:28;"but he whispers under her breath as they're dancing,"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"""You look perfect,"" but she heard it."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"- She heard it and smelt the breath, too."
01:50:32;01:50:33;"(laughing)"
01:50:33;01:50:34;"- Well, do you like when a songwriter"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"paints a picture like that?"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"- I was not, a picture wasn't painted for me,"
01:50:38;01:50:43;"but under, it paints a creepy picture, I guess."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"Whispering, a lot of whispering going on"
01:50:46;01:50:49;"that shouldn't be heard, but was."
01:50:49;01:50:52;"- Well, I guess-- - I don't know."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"- Why did Ed Sheeran, that's the new mystery."
01:50:54;01:50:57;"There's always a mystery in an Ed Sheeran song."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"In this song, the question is,"
01:50:59;01:51:02;"when this girl said she looked a mess"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"and you thought she looked perfect,"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"why did you either A, keep your damn mouth shut,"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"or B, to say it at a regular volume?"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"- Yeah, shake, like, ""What are you talking about?"
01:51:10;01:51:11;"""You look great."""
01:51:11;01:51:13;"- 'Cause she was between his arms, right?"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"So are they like slow dancing?"
01:51:15;01:51:18;"- I don't like the line, ""Between his arms,"" either."
01:51:18;01:51:21;"Like his arms could be wide out."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"- They're having like a super intimate, close moment."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"- Between his arms. - And he's just kinda--"
01:51:25;01:51:27;"- In his arms, not between his arms."
01:51:27;01:51:30;"- Right, between his, between his odd."

01:52:24;01:52:26;"- Coming in at number one."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"- It's time for number one."
01:52:28;01:52:32;"So I didn't know that Tim,"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"that you were, you're just a rock guy."
01:52:33;01:52:34;"Nothing wrong with that."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"- I'm not a rock guy."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"- You're a rock guy."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"- I'm not, I'm all kinds of guy, but--"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"- Just not hip hop?"
01:52:41;01:52:42;"- Not hip hop."
01:52:42;01:52:43;"- Or pop."
01:52:43;01:52:44;"- Not pop, no."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"- Not Ed Sheeran."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"- I like jazz."
01:52:46;01:52:49;"I like, yeah, I like all kinds of stuff,"
01:52:49;01:52:53;"but pop, modern pop is a bit alien to me."
01:52:53;01:52:54;"- Leaves you cold."
01:52:54;01:52:56;"Okay, well you might be happy to know"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"that ""Against All Odds"" in 2017--"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"- The song from Phil Collins, ""Against All Odds""?"
01:53:01;01:53:03;"- Is number one."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"- Again?"
01:53:04;01:53:05;"- It was in a Papa John's commercial."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"(laughing)"
01:53:06;01:53:09;"And it's racing up the charts."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"No, the number one song right now on iTunes"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"is actually by a rock band."
01:53:13;01:53:13;"- Really?"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"- An alternative rock band."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"- It's an American band?"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"- An American band, they're from Nevada."
01:53:17;01:53:18;"- Geez."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"And they've been around for a while, or are they pretty new?"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"- They're relatively new."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"I think this might be their second or third album."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"The band's called Imagine Dragons."
01:53:26;01:53:27;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- You know them?"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"- Are they considered a rock band?"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Seems like--"
01:53:30;01:53:33;"- Well, their music has obviously a lot of influence"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"from modern pop production,"
01:53:35;01:53:37;"but the delivery and the tone, I think you could say,"
01:53:37;01:53:40;"is somewhere in the tradition of alternative rock."
01:53:40;01:53:43;"♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪"
01:53:43;01:53:44;"- Yes."

01:53:49;01:53:50;"- That's not a bad guess."
01:53:50;01:53:53;"So this is, they've really had a lot of hits recently,"
01:53:53;01:53:55;"so this is their big song right now."
01:53:55;01:54:00;"Number one on the charts, 2017, ""Thunder""."

01:54:57;01:55:00;"- I'm a little confused why this is the number one song"
01:55:00;01:55:01;"in America, I guess."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"- I have a slight theory."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"This really is, like the 10th of this song"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"is kind of big enough for everybody."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"Like, this honestly doesn't sound that different"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"than like modern country."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"'Cause you know, like if you're listening"
01:55:13;01:55:15;"to modern country radio and it's,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"some of it outside of a slight southern twang"
01:55:17;01:55:20;"has nothing to do with traditional country."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"It has big pop drums and big hooks and stuff."
01:55:22;01:55:25;"So I think somebody who's into country could,"
01:55:25;01:55:27;"modern country could potentially like Imagine Dragons."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"Somebody who's into rock could."
01:55:29;01:55:31;"Somebody who's into pop, somebody who's into hip hop."
01:55:31;01:55:34;"It has like a big beat, a big hook."
01:55:34;01:55:36;"It's almost a genre-less, I guess, in a way."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"- Where's the hook?"
01:55:37;01:55:37;"I haven't heard it yet."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"- The hook was, was the baby voice."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"That's kind of EDM too."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"- Yeah, it's a little EDM."
01:55:42;01:55:43;"- You get the idea."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"Let's just do a quick lyrical analysis."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"Kids were laughing in my classes"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"while I was scheming for the masses."
01:55:50;01:55:54;"That could be like some random Pink Floyd song."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"(laughing)"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"While I was scheming for the masses."
01:55:59;01:56:03;"Who do you think you are, dreaming about being a big star?"
01:56:03;01:56:06;"- Ah, these guys writing about being stars,"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"that are stars, is just very--"
01:56:08;01:56:12;"- Well, but look, these guys are from--"
01:56:12;01:56:12;"- Nevada?"
01:56:12;01:56:15;"- You know, like maybe he's just telling his own story."
01:56:15;01:56:16;"Kids were laughing at him in his classes."
01:56:16;01:56:17;"He wanted to be a rock star."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"And they said, ""Who do you think you are?"
01:56:18;01:56:21;"""You're from a small town in Nevada."
01:56:21;01:56:24;"""We're not producing number one iTunes artists."""
01:56:24;01:56:26;"- What do they think, they are a bad company?"
01:56:26;01:56:29;"- Maybe they're referencing bad company a little bit."
01:56:29;01:56:33;"And he says, ""You say you're basic, you say you're easy."
01:56:33;01:56:35;"""You're always riding in the back seat."""
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Who's he talking to?"
01:56:37;01:56:38;"""Now I'm smiling from the stage"
01:56:38;01:56:41;"""while you were clapping in the nosebleeds."""
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Is he talking about like a kid from school?"
01:56:43;01:56:44;"- Yeah, this kid from school that--"
01:56:44;01:56:45;"- Picked on him."
01:56:45;01:56:47;"- Now this kid's going to see the show"
01:56:47;01:56:49;"and is in the worst seats in the house."
01:56:49;01:56:52;"Kind of a (beep) thing to sing about."
01:56:52;01:56:53;"I don't know."
01:56:53;01:56:55;"- I mean, could you relate to that at all?"
01:56:55;01:56:56;"Are there any kids from Allentown"
01:56:56;01:56:58;"that you thought were a (beep)"
01:56:58;01:56:59;"- No, I was the (beep)"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"- Oh, you were the mean kid?"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"- I was the bully."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"Oh yeah, I was a bully."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"I was a big bully in high school."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"- Oh, you were a bully too."
01:57:05;01:57:07;"- Yeah, I used to beat the (beep) out of kids."
01:57:07;01:57:08;"- Some kid coming to school with a--"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"- Oh yeah, the disabled-- - A Sinead O'Connor t-shirt."
01:57:10;01:57:11;"- Disabled kids."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"- Oh damn, oh so you really--"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"- I'd rip them out of their wheelchair"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"and throw them down the stairs."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"- Oh, that's--"
01:57:16;01:57:20;"- I got suspended and I got put in juvenile delinquent"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"prison or whatever."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Yeah."
01:57:22;01:57:23;"- Oh, you did some time?"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"- Yeah, I was a bad egg."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"I was a bad egg."
01:57:25;01:57:27;"- Oh, so you were a really bad kid."
01:57:27;01:57:31;"- Sold cigarettes out of the carton."
01:57:31;01:57:31;"- Oh, so you were a bad kid."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"So how did--"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"- Yeah, I wore a leather jacket and cigarettes."
01:57:34;01:57:36;"- How'd you get into Temple with a record like that?"
01:57:36;01:57:40;"- My dad paid, I mean, we were rich."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"So he just paid me to get into the state school."
01:57:44;01:57:46;"Still pays for a lot of the (beep) I have."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"My Tesla."
01:57:47;01:57:51;"No, I don't know."
01:57:51;01:57:53;"I can't think of anybody I'd wanna spend any time with"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"from high school, honestly."
01:57:55;01:57:57;"On either side of that equation."
01:57:57;01:58:00;"- You don't have one friend from that time"
01:58:00;01:58:01;"that you're in touch with?"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"- I'm probably forgetting about my closest friend right now."
01:58:03;01:58:06;"- Okay, so what's your verdict ultimately"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"on Imagine Dragons Thunder?"
01:58:08;01:58:09;"- Unimpressed."
01:58:09;01:58:11;"- Totally unimpressed?"
01:58:11;01:58:14;"- Yeah, I bet they have a song that got them"
01:58:14;01:58:16;"to where they are now that might be catchy or something."
01:58:16;01:58:17;"Catchier."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"- So you didn't like a damn song in the top five."
01:58:19;01:58:20;"- That's correct."
01:58:21;01:58:23;"I apologize."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"I'd love to be swayed."
01:58:25;01:58:28;"I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud."
01:58:28;01:58:31;"- No, we appreciate you giving your honest opinion."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"So does listening to the top five"
01:58:32;01:58:35;"inspire you to spend more time with modern music?"
01:58:35;01:58:39;"- It does not, I'm sorry to say."
01:58:39;01:58:41;"It has not been a positive experience."
01:58:41;01:58:43;"It has been a good experience talking to you"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"and having some laughs."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"- Oh, fair enough."
01:58:46;01:58:49;"- Listening to Allentown and the Class of '94 music."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"That was good."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Would you rather listen to Hootie and the Blowfish"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"than any of the top five?"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"- I think unfortunately I think I would."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"- All right, well that's our top five."
01:58:57;01:58:58;"Thanks everybody for listening."
01:58:58;01:59:00;"Thanks to Tim Heidecker."
01:59:00;01:59:01;"- Sorry I'm such a bummer."
01:59:01;01:59:03;"- No, we appreciate you keeping it real."
01:59:03;01:59:05;"Time Crisis is all about keeping it real."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"Thanks to John Gorley from Portugal, the man,"
01:59:07;01:59:08;"for calling in."

01:59:18;01:59:21;"Anybody who has a problem with that is heartless."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"- I have a problem with it because"
01:59:23;01:59:26;"that changes the strike zone on the pitcher."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"You understand?"
01:59:27;01:59:30;"If you wanted to win every ball game in the,"
01:59:30;01:59:33;"you could hire midgets for your entire team"
01:59:33;01:59:36;"and the pitcher could not throw a strike."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"That's a fact."
01:59:37;01:59:41;"Normal sized guys from now on in baseball."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"You gotta have a height requirement."
