01:39;01:46;"- Time Crisis, season two, episode three."
01:46;01:49;"We're back, broadcasting from Los Angeles."
01:49;01:50;"I'm here with Jake Longstreth."
01:50;01:51;"What's up, Jake?"
01:51;01:52;"- Hey, how are you?"
01:52;01:53;"- Good to see you again, man."
01:53;01:55;"- Good to see you."
01:55;01:56;"- You're working on some great paintings."
01:56;01:57;"- Oh, thank you."
01:57;01:59;"- I really liked the Chase Bank ones."
01:59;02:00;"- Oh, cool."
02:00;02:00;"Yeah, I did this grid,"
02:00;02:04;"I did a piece that's nine Chase Bank paintings"
02:04;02:05;"hung on a grid."
02:05;02:06;"- All different locations."
02:06;02:07;"- Yeah."
02:07;02:08;"- But they all kind of look the same."
02:08;02:11;"- Yeah, it was an exploration"
02:11;02:14;"in this sort of homogenous retail architecture"
02:14;02:14;"that's everywhere."
02:14;02:16;"- Speaking of the retail landscape,"
02:16;02:17;"before the show started,"
02:17;02:19;"we were having a little conversation."
02:19;02:22;"This is something I've really been wanting to clear up."
02:22;02:24;"I saw a meme last week"
02:24;02:28;"that was a box of variety pack of chips."
02:28;02:29;"- Yeah."
02:29;02:30;"- And it was a picture of it"
02:30;02:34;"where all that's left are the Fritos,"
02:34;02:37;"like four bags of Fritos on the bottom of like a box."
02:37;02:39;"And then the meme was something like,"
02:39;02:43;"""You know you're hungry when you finally go eat the dregs"
02:43;02:44;"of the variety pack."""
02:44;02:48;"Basically implying that Fritos are the worst chip"
02:48;02:49;"that comes in a variety pack."
02:49;02:50;"- It's a little childish."
02:50;02:51;"- It's a little childish."
02:51;02:53;"First of all, I think if you support a company"
02:53;02:55;"such as the Frito-Lay company,"
02:55;02:56;"you gotta be all in."
02:56;02:58;"You don't play favorites."
02:58;03:01;"- You have to be all in with the full product line."
03:01;03:03;"- That's my personal belief."
03:03;03:04;"So then I was thinking about it and I was like,"
03:04;03:07;"""Well, so what is this anti-Frito thing?"""
03:07;03:09;"So you're somebody who thinks deeply"
03:09;03:11;"about the retail landscape."
03:11;03:14;"So I was wondering, is this something you're familiar with?"
03:14;03:16;"Did kids always hate Fritos?"
03:16;03:17;"Has that always been the case?"
03:17;03:18;"- I think so."
03:18;03:19;"I think it's the least sexy of the chip."
03:19;03:20;"- Why?"
03:20;03:22;"- It's the least sort of like caked"
03:22;03:26;"in that sort of orange powder, insane chemical flavoring."
03:26;03:29;"Now see, as a kid, I would go with the nacho cheese Dorito."
03:29;03:31;"No questions asked."
03:31;03:34;"And the Fritos would be this kind of like frail,"
03:34;03:36;"it's like a lateral move from like a tortilla chip."
03:36;03:38;"- You mean it's not even better than a tortilla chip?"
03:38;03:40;"- It's like barely a step up from tortilla chip."
03:40;03:43;"- There is something very like childish about Doritos."
03:43;03:46;"- Like your friend in eighth grade"
03:46;03:48;"with just that sort of like orange."
03:48;03:49;"- Orange mustache."
03:50;03:51;"- You know what it is also?"
03:51;03:56;"Like the Doritos breath is so like childish."
03:56;03:57;"- So brutal."
03:57;03:58;"- Like Doritos breath just reminds me"
03:58;04:02;"of like wrestling with like another kid,"
04:02;04:04;"like in somebody's attic or basement,"
04:04;04:07;"just like suplexing fools, just like Boston crab."
04:07;04:08;"- Mom!"
04:08;04:12;"- Yeah, just like literally like doing flips off a couch."
04:12;04:13;"- Tyler, what the hell, dude?"
04:13;04:17;"- Just like pulling some kid's head up in the camel clutch"
04:17;04:19;"and then just like smelling this disgusting thing"
04:19;04:20;"off their mouth."
04:20;04:22;"- Yeah, just imagine if you were like"
04:22;04:24;"getting intimate with somebody."
04:24;04:24;"- I was just thinking,"
04:24;04:26;"imagine kissing someone with Doritos."
04:26;04:29;"Imagine like first kiss, like eighth grade."
04:29;04:32;"- You know, the smell that I associate the most"
04:32;04:37;"with kind of like early romantic sexual stuff"
04:37;04:42;"was like this mix of Malibu and dentine fresh gum."
04:42;04:43;"- Holy."
04:43;04:44;"- Because remember when you're like a teenager,"
04:44;04:47;"sometimes there'd be like a group of people,"
04:47;04:48;"I don't know, this is at least how it was"
04:48;04:49;"in my weird little town,"
04:49;04:51;"be like a group of people and it's like basically,"
04:51;04:53;"all right, everybody's gonna pair off now"
04:53;04:55;"and it's like, everybody's like passing around the gum,"
04:55;04:59;"like everybody grab a stick of dentine fresh"
04:59;05:00;"and then you know, find an empty room."
05:00;05:01;"And then everybody's drunk,"
05:01;05:02;"but they also have like this like"
05:02;05:05;"really artificial mint flavor on there."
05:05;05:06;"- I wish I was at those parties."
05:06;05:08;"I had nothing going on in high school."
05:08;05:08;"- Really?"
05:08;05:09;"- Oh, nothing."
05:09;05:10;"- I didn't have a lot going on."
05:10;05:13;"I didn't have a lot, but like towards the end,"
05:13;05:15;"some very heavy drinking."
05:15;05:17;"- I had a girlfriend senior year of high school,"
05:17;05:19;"but it was stone cold sober."
05:19;05:20;"- Really?"
05:20;05:21;"- Very dry mouth."
05:21;05:24;"- My town was so hard drinking."
05:24;05:24;"- Interesting."
05:24;05:27;"- Going to school dances really drunk was the thing."
05:27;05:29;"'Cause you'd have to get super drunk at somebody's house."
05:29;05:31;"And again, this was not my day to day,"
05:31;05:32;"but even like with my friends,"
05:32;05:33;"there was like this thing of like,"
05:33;05:36;"well, we're going to the dance, I guess we have to,"
05:36;05:37;"I guess that's what you do."
05:37;05:39;"And then like some kid pulls out like,"
05:39;05:44;"well, my mom has this warm plastic bottle of beef eater gin."
05:44;05:47;"I guess we could just take shots of this, disgusting."
05:47;05:49;"- Wow, God, that was not my scene."
05:49;05:51;"- I've drank less in my thirties than in high school,"
05:51;05:53;"somehow I survived."
05:53;05:54;"- I mean, that's definitely an archetype."
05:54;05:56;"I mean, I just think I was sort of square"
05:56;05:58;"and just like hanging out with dudes."
05:58;06:00;"- I was square too, but my town was so small"
06:00;06:02;"that you couldn't help but get pulled into the orbit"
06:02;06:04;"of the cool kids."
06:04;06:07;"Anyway, we got a great show coming up."
06:07;06:09;"I'm glad we cleared up the whole Fritos thing."
06:09;06:12;"On this show, we're going to be talking a lot about demos,"
06:12;06:15;"songwriting samples, because the Beyonce album"
06:15;06:18;"has inspired a lot of conversation about this."
06:18;06:21;"I was a co-writer and co-producer on a song."
06:21;06:22;"So I've been having a lot of people like tweeting at me"
06:22;06:24;"the past couple of weeks about the song."
06:24;06:28;"So we're going to talk to Nikki Mayard,"
06:28;06:30;"a music journalist based in New York,"
06:30;06:33;"known as @JudNikki on Twitter."
06:33;06:35;"We're going to talk to her a little bit about"
06:35;06:38;"just kind of like the overall perception of Beyonce,"
06:38;06:42;"why people want to dissect her writing credit so much."
06:42;06:45;"I'm going to break down my collaboration with Beyonce"
06:45;06:48;"and many other people on this song called ""Holled Up."""
06:48;06:50;"Also get into some old Vampire Weekend songs,"
06:50;06:51;"kind of break down the component parts."
06:51;06:54;"And then we're going to have both of our good friend,"
06:54;06:56;"Ariel Rechshied, producer,"
06:56;06:59;"who co-produced the last Vampire Weekend album,"
06:59;07:02;"worked with The Himes, Sky Ferreira, Cass McCombs, et cetera."
07:02;07:05;"And he's going to break down the story of his involvement"
07:05;07:07;"in the Usher classic ""Climax."""
07:07;07:08;"- Great song."
07:08;07:09;"- Excellent song."
07:09;07:11;"And of course the top five."
07:11;07:12;"You ready, Jake?"
07:12;07:13;"- I'm pumped."

10:58;10:59;"- Okay, so as I said,"
10:59;11:01;"we're gonna be talking about the new Beyonce album."
11:01;11:02;"It's called Lemonade."
11:02;11:03;"You listened to it, Jake?"
11:03;11:05;"- I listened to it one and a half times."
11:05;11:07;"- Wow, I'm impressed."
11:07;11:07;"- Thank you."
11:07;11:09;"- 'Cause last time we were talking,"
11:09;11:11;"you didn't know who Future or Designer was."
11:11;11:12;"- That's true, I still don't."
11:12;11:13;"(laughing)"
11:13;11:15;"- But of course, but you know Beyonce is."
11:15;11:16;"- Absolutely."
11:16;11:17;"- And you listened to her album."
11:17;11:19;"This album Lemonade was a major event."
11:19;11:20;"- Huge."
11:20;11:21;"- It continues to be."
11:21;11:22;"- Yeah."
11:22;11:23;"- People are still talking about it."
11:23;11:26;"I've had a lot of people who are very confused"
11:26;11:28;"to see my name in the credits."
11:28;11:29;"So we're gonna talk a little bit about"
11:29;11:32;"how I got involved on this record."
11:32;11:34;"But first, to kind of talk about Beyonce in general,"
11:34;11:37;"we're gonna have a chat with Nikki Mayard,"
11:37;11:38;"the music journalist."
11:38;11:40;"So let's give her a call."
11:40;11:43;"- Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
11:43;11:46;"(phone ringing)"
11:46;11:48;"- Hello?"
11:48;11:49;"- Hey, what's up?"
11:49;11:50;"- Hi, I'm good."
11:50;11:54;"- We're talking about Beyonce a bit today."
11:54;11:58;"And specifically, because I was one of the co-writers"
11:58;12:00;"of a song on the new album,"
12:00;12:04;"it'd been interesting seeing so many people's reactions"
12:04;12:07;"to the album, which by and large was positive."
12:07;12:10;"But I noticed I was getting added a lot"
12:10;12:12;"in different people's debates"
12:12;12:14;"about the writing of the album."
12:14;12:17;"And it seemed that who wrote what"
12:17;12:19;"was very important to people"
12:19;12:22;"in ways that sometimes seemed like just out of curiosity,"
12:22;12:25;"but sometimes in a slightly more negative way."
12:25;12:27;"So I thought that you as a music journalist"
12:27;12:30;"maybe could help contextualize for us."
12:30;12:32;"Why are people so fascinated"
12:32;12:35;"by how Beyonce songs in particular get written?"
12:35;12:36;"- I think a lot of it has to do"
12:36;12:38;"with what people have always seen Beyonce as."
12:38;12:42;"And I think that a lot of it is in Beyonce's presentation."
12:42;12:43;"Beyonce presents herself,"
12:43;12:46;"she has always been very in command."
12:46;12:50;"And that has led to the idea that Beyonce is a cyborg."
12:50;12:52;"Or that she's a pageant queen,"
12:52;12:54;"or that because she's very aware of who she is,"
12:54;12:56;"because she's very aware of the way"
12:56;12:58;"that she looks presence-wise, image-wise,"
12:58;12:59;"people see her as a pageant queen."
12:59;13:00;"And it really comes down to,"
13:00;13:02;"they're just not willing to believe"
13:02;13:05;"that a pop star, let alone a black woman,"
13:05;13:08;"could write something that has genre,"
13:08;13:10;"has depth, has anything to it."
13:10;13:12;"Because we kind of live in a culture"
13:12;13:15;"that's based on the belief that everyone who's famous"
13:15;13:16;"is not really that smart."
13:16;13:17;"- Right."
13:17;13:19;"It's interesting to me that traditionally"
13:19;13:23;"we accept that many of the greatest performers,"
13:23;13:28;"singers, whatever, don't necessarily write everything"
13:28;13:28;"that they sing."
13:28;13:31;"So it's not a surprise that Beyonce"
13:31;13:32;"has a lot of collaborators,"
13:32;13:34;"has worked with songwriters,"
13:34;13:36;"probably been given songs."
13:36;13:38;"Clearly she puts it together on this album"
13:38;13:42;"almost more than any into a much larger multimedia project."
13:42;13:44;"But people still almost seem to think"
13:44;13:47;"that if they can prove that she didn't write"
13:47;13:48;"a certain line or something,"
13:48;13:50;"that that somehow discredits the larger thing."
13:50;13:52;"Which is so weird to me,"
13:52;13:55;"because many of the greatest artists of all time"
13:55;14:00;"are curator, orchestrator, entertainers."
14:00;14:01;"It doesn't take away from the larger message"
14:01;14:03;"that an artist is putting out"
14:03;14:06;"because they collaborate with other songwriters."
14:06;14:08;"But with Beyonce, it's like a whole new conversation."
14:08;14:10;"- Well, I think also you have to think about the fact"
14:10;14:12;"that Beyonce is a woman."
14:12;14:14;"And I think that, number one,"
14:14;14:16;"is the first flat out reason that people do that."
14:16;14:18;"We see it commonly,"
14:18;14:19;"even with women that we really respect,"
14:19;14:22;"like old greats like Patti and Arita,"
14:22;14:24;"people are always really quick to remind people that,"
14:24;14:26;"""Oh, blah, blah, blah, I wrote this for her,"""
14:26;14:28;"or ""Blah, blah, I wrote this for her."""
14:28;14:29;"It's a huge conversation,"
14:29;14:31;"and it has been for a long time in culture,"
14:31;14:32;"the way we talk about music,"
14:32;14:35;"to make it seem like women are just faces."
14:35;14:37;"And the prettier you are,"
14:37;14:38;"the less people are willing to believe"
14:38;14:40;"that you can do something."
14:40;14:43;"People show a lot of false love for women behind the scenes."
14:43;14:45;"There's a lot of times where you'll see people be like,"
14:45;14:47;"""Oh, Esther Jean, and Rihanna stole that,"
14:47;14:49;"or she wrote that, Rihanna has that."""
14:49;14:52;"And I'm like, ""Yeah, but the song that she wrote"
14:52;14:53;"was for this person."""
14:53;14:58;"Her job as a songwriter is not to be Beyonce"
14:58;14:58;"or be Rihanna."
14:58;15:00;"Her job as a songwriter is to write songs"
15:00;15:01;"that they will sing."
15:01;15:03;"That's what she wants to do."
15:03;15:03;"- Right."
15:03;15:06;"- It just ties into such basic stuff."
15:06;15:10;"And when I think about how often people accredit"
15:10;15:13;"the way that Beyonce is doing more of a rap singing"
15:13;15:15;"kind of sound to Jay-Z,"
15:15;15:16;"which is like,"
15:16;15:18;"Beyonce's been doing this before she was dating Jay-Z,"
15:18;15:21;"but there's this disconnect"
15:21;15:26;"in seeing the linear legacy of a lot of women artists."
15:26;15:29;"And it really bothers me because I really do feel like"
15:29;15:31;"a lot of it is also a little bit racial,"
15:31;15:35;"a little bit the way that people talk about country singers"
15:35;15:37;"who are predominantly white,"
15:37;15:38;"and people love to talk about how those women"
15:38;15:41;"write all their songs, their soul, whatever."
15:41;15:42;"But when I look at R&B singers,"
15:42;15:44;"when I look at pop,"
15:44;15:46;"anyone that looks other,"
15:46;15:47;"people go through the liner notes"
15:47;15:49;"with like a fine tooth comb,"
15:49;15:50;"just to be like,"
15:50;15:51;"you know,"
15:51;15:52;"Beyonce wrote like one word on this,"
15:52;15:53;"which is like,"
15:53;15:54;"it doesn't matter."
15:54;15:55;"She's the vessel that delivers it."
15:55;15:57;"Nobody would be in the room"
15:57;15:59;"if they didn't think Beyonce was going to sing the song."
15:59;16:00;"- That was pretty funny for me"
16:00;16:03;"as somebody who was involved in the writing"
16:03;16:04;"of the song ""Hold Up"""
16:04;16:07;"is that so many people were going through it"
16:07;16:09;"as if, first of all,"
16:09;16:13;"there are many people credited as writers on the song."
16:13;16:14;"So it's not hidden."
16:14;16:15;"But people were like tweeting at me,"
16:15;16:16;"like as if they,"
16:16;16:19;"oh, actually the AES wrote that,"
16:19;16:22;"like as if they were like discovering something,"
16:22;16:23;"as if they were,"
16:23;16:24;"they found something out"
16:24;16:27;"that fully discredited the idea of Beyonce."
16:27;16:29;"And you know what the sad part"
16:29;16:30;"about the people so desperate"
16:30;16:31;"to pour through the liner notes"
16:31;16:33;"in a negative way is that,"
16:33;16:36;"and I imagine you feel the same way as a music journalist,"
16:36;16:38;"like we're both people who are obsessed with music."
16:38;16:40;"Going through the liner notes is supposed to be fun."
16:40;16:42;"It's supposed to be like exciting."
16:42;16:45;"And the idea that people turn into this negative thing"
16:45;16:46;"that it's undercutting something,"
16:46;16:48;"like I love knowing what the samples are,"
16:48;16:49;"who got together,"
16:49;16:50;"who wrote this and that,"
16:50;16:51;"like it's cool."
16:51;16:55;"It only makes me respect the artists more when I see that."
16:55;16:57;"- Yeah, to me, the liner notes are the story of a song."
16:57;17:01;"Like I remember when I started reading R&B liner notes"
17:01;17:03;"and being like, what, like who?"
17:03;17:04;"Like there was like the story of the song."
17:04;17:06;"It's like the origin story."
17:06;17:07;"And you start to think about like,"
17:07;17:10;"okay, like Father John Misty's on this song?"
17:10;17:11;"When did that happen?"
17:11;17:13;"And like when did Ezra get it?"
17:13;17:16;"Or like, you know, like when you tweeted like"
17:16;17:17;"a follow-up to the lyric"
17:17;17:19;"and the tweet was from four years ago"
17:19;17:20;"and I was like, I'm dying."
17:20;17:22;"'Cause it's just like all of a sudden it becomes like,"
17:22;17:26;"oh, Beyonce wrote this song about J.D. like two days ago."
17:26;17:28;"So like, oh crap, like this song is from four years,"
17:28;17:29;"you know, like this song has been,"
17:29;17:32;"how did these people not say anything?"
17:32;17:34;"They've been working on this for so long, you know?"
17:34;17:36;"And that to me, like you said,"
17:36;17:38;"you're taking away the joy of what is supposed to be"
17:38;17:41;"one of the most pleasurable parts of music."
17:41;17:45;"And I just feel like so much of the way we discuss music now,"
17:45;17:47;"especially the way we discuss bigger stars"
17:47;17:50;"because we live in a culture where people feel like"
17:50;17:52;"they know too much about the stars."
17:52;17:53;"And I think that creates a feeling"
17:53;17:56;"of this weird entitlement to them."
17:56;17:59;"And so now I think people get more focused"
17:59;18:00;"on the part of the lives of the stars"
18:00;18:01;"that they feel entitled to,"
18:01;18:04;"the part of the things they should be talking about."
18:04;18:07;"And then at the same time,"
18:07;18:08;"I feel like people are just finding more ways"
18:08;18:09;"to not enjoy music."
18:10;18:13;"- Right, maybe that's true of just life in general."
18:13;18:16;"The internet gives us so many ways to not enjoy life."
18:16;18:17;"- Like plastic or trash culture."
18:17;18:18;"- Yeah, exactly."
18:18;18:21;"- Try really hard not to like music."
18:21;18:22;"- Right, I think you're exactly right."
18:22;18:23;"Well, you know, Nikki, that's the perfect note"
18:23;18:27;"for us to get into our own story"
18:27;18:30;"or my part of the story of how that song came about."
18:30;18:31;"So I'm gonna kind of break it down"
18:31;18:34;"and play some of the early contributions of Hauk out there."
18:34;18:36;"But thank you so much for calling in."
18:36;18:38;"Pleasure talking to you and I hope you can come on again."
18:38;18:40;"- Absolutely, I would be happy to come on again."
18:40;18:41;"You guys have a good one."
18:41;18:42;"- You too."
18:42;18:43;"All right, bye."
18:43;18:44;"- Bye."

22:07;22:08;"Batteries not included."
22:13;22:15;"- So Jake, I wanna talk about the Beyonce song,"
22:15;22:17;"""Hold Up"" from Lemonade."
22:17;22:19;"- It's a good song."
22:19;22:20;"- Thank you."
22:20;22:21;"If I'm allowed to say thank you."
22:21;22:23;"- Well, are you?"
22:23;22:24;"(Jake laughs)"
22:24;22:24;"- That's a good question."
22:24;22:26;"- I'm psyched to find out what you did."
22:26;22:27;"- Yeah, I worked on it."
22:27;22:29;"See, a lot of people were confused."
22:29;22:31;"Basically, part of the confusion was"
22:31;22:34;"that the hook of the song is,"
22:34;22:36;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
22:36;22:38;"And I wrote a tweet in 2011 that said,"
22:38;22:40;"""Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."""
22:40;22:41;"People were looking at the tweet."
22:41;22:42;"When the album came out,"
22:42;22:44;"then I wrote the second line."
22:44;22:46;"And so people were looking at this old tweet"
22:46;22:49;"and being like, ""Why did you post Beyonce lyrics in 2011?"
22:49;22:49;"""What does this mean?"
22:49;22:50;"""Did you just predict this?"""
22:50;22:52;"And then people were like, ""Well, hold on."
22:52;22:54;"""Isn't that just like, yeah, yeah's lyrics?"""
22:54;22:55;"And he just changed a word."
22:55;22:57;"And then some people started to be like,"
22:57;22:59;"""Maybe this guy just got credit on this Beyonce song"
22:59;23:02;"""because he tweeted some yeah, yeah's lyrics."""
23:02;23:03;"""Well, that's messed up."
23:03;23:04;"""What about the yeah, yeah?"""
23:04;23:06;"And so there's like this weird conversations about credit"
23:06;23:08;"and like, ""Did I trick Beyonce"
23:08;23:10;"""or did I just get credit 'cause of a tweet?"""
23:10;23:12;"I explained it as best I could 'cause people,"
23:12;23:14;"some people were very confused by it."
23:14;23:18;"But it's a lot easier to explain it with the music."
23:18;23:18;"- Great."
23:18;23:21;"- I guess one place to start would be with the sample"
23:21;23:23;"that the song is built around."
23:23;23:25;"And this is a Diplo special."
23:25;23:28;"And so I've worked with Diplo in the past."
23:28;23:32;"We did a song for Major Lazer called ""Jessica."""
23:32;23:33;"Not to be confused with the Allman Brothers song."
23:33;23:34;"- That's a tight title."
23:34;23:34;"- Thank you."
23:34;23:38;"I do think that's one of my best titles, Jessica."
23:38;23:41;"So Diplo, his real name is Wes."
23:41;23:43;"So maybe we'll make like a new Major Lazer song"
23:43;23:44;"or something."
23:44;23:46;"I get there, he plays me a bunch of beats"
23:46;23:47;"all over the place."
23:47;23:49;"And there's one that I really like."
23:49;23:50;"And I'm like, ""What's that one?"""
23:50;23:52;"And he's like, ""Oh, that's just kind of like this loop"
23:52;23:54;"""of this weird old '60s song."""
23:54;23:56;"He was kind of like filtering it."
23:56;23:58;"But essentially it was just a loop"
23:58;24:00;"that he was kind of like having some fun with."
24:00;24:01;"And I was like, ""Oh, I love that one."
24:01;24:04;"""So weird 'cause it almost sounds like a little like ska,"
24:04;24:05;"""but there's something weird about it."""
24:05;24:06;"And this is what he was looping,"
24:06;24:09;"was this Andy Williams song from the '60s"
24:09;24:11;"called ""Can't Get Used to Losing You."""
24:13;24:14;"Sound familiar?"
24:14;24:15;"- Yeah."
24:15;24:16;"- Bum, bum."
24:18;24:19;"So this is looped over and over again."
24:19;24:22;"This is what the real song sounds like though."
24:22;24:24;"♪ Guess there's no use in hanging around ♪"
24:24;24:25;"- Oh, cool."
24:27;24:30;"♪ Guess I'll get dressed and do the town ♪"

24:44;24:46;"- It's like a schmaltzy '60s song."
24:46;24:47;"- Yep."
24:47;24:48;"♪ What I try to do with my life ♪"
24:48;24:51;"- So obviously the part that Wes had identified"
24:51;24:53;"and that he was turning into a beat"
24:53;24:54;"was just the beginning."
24:56;24:59;"♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪"
24:59;25:01;"- And I'm not super tapped into the Diplo aesthetic,"
25:01;25:03;"but from what I've heard,"
25:03;25:06;"this seems pretty characteristic of his style."
25:06;25:07;"No?"
25:07;25:08;"- Well, it kind of reminds me,"
25:08;25:10;"like the song that Amber Kaufman did with him."
25:10;25:10;"- Oh yeah, sure."
25:10;25:13;"- Has similar, a similar kind of like,"
25:13;25:14;"- Well, yeah, like,"
25:14;25:15;"- feel or bounce or something."
25:15;25:17;"- Yeah, well, Major Lazer, I think,"
25:17;25:19;"was always supposed to be like Jamaican."
25:19;25:23;"Like collaborations with Jamaican artists,"
25:23;25:26;"samples of ska and reggae, dance hall,"
25:26;25:29;"futuristic dance hall type stuff."
25:29;25:30;"But so the fact that this has a little bit"
25:30;25:31;"of that ska offbeat,"
25:31;25:33;"♪ Bum, bum ♪"
25:33;25:34;"- Gives it a little bit of that"
25:34;25:36;"kind of Jamaican tropical feel."
25:36;25:36;"- Okay."
25:36;25:38;"- I'm sure Andy Williams wasn't trying to"
25:38;25:41;"make a ska song in 1964, but whatever."
25:41;25:43;"I think, I think Wes heard that"
25:43;25:45;"and identified it as something that kind of,"
25:45;25:46;"yeah, that fit his vibe."
25:46;25:50;"So he looped it and was kind of like,"
25:50;25:53;"like adding some like percussion and like filtering it."
25:53;25:55;"And so then I get, I was like, oh, I like that one."
25:55;25:57;"And then he says,"
25:57;25:59;"actually, I don't remember what he said."
25:59;26:00;"I'm not going to make up any fake dialogue."
26:00;26:01;"But then he was like, all right,"
26:01;26:02;"well, do you have an idea for a hook?"
26:02;26:04;"- No, please make up fake dialogue."
26:04;26:05;"- So Wes was like,"
26:05;26:08;"all right, bro, you're going to come,"
26:08;26:09;"you're going to come write a good hook on this?"
26:09;26:10;"And I was like,"
26:10;26:13;"Wes, you're right."
26:13;26:15;"I'm going to write a good hook on this."
26:15;26:15;"- I'm a professional."
26:16;26:17;"And he's like, all right, cool."
26:17;26:18;"I'm a professional too."
26:18;26:20;"And I was like, all right, let's do this."
26:20;26:24;"So then I didn't really have anything though."
26:24;26:27;"So I thought back to that tweet,"
26:27;26:31;"which all it says is,"
26:31;26:32;"hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
26:32;26:34;"Now, so now we got to kind of go back on the other branch."
26:34;26:36;"- Wait, so you just thought of that tweet?"
26:36;26:37;"- Yes."
26:37;26:38;"- Okay."
26:38;26:39;"- Sometimes I think about tweets."
26:39;26:40;"- Sometimes it pops in."
26:40;26:41;"- Right."
26:41;26:43;"So first for people who don't know,"
26:43;26:44;"to me, this is a very famous song,"
26:44;26:46;"but not everybody necessarily knows it."
26:46;26:48;"It came out a while ago."
26:48;26:51;"So this is the original song by the AES called Maps."
26:51;26:52;"You remember this?"
26:52;26:57;"So we can skip ahead to the chorus."
26:57;26:58;"- Yeah."
26:58;27:03;"- Wait, they don't love you like I love you."
27:03;27:03;"- Wait."
27:04;27:06;"- They don't love you like I love you."
27:06;27:07;"- Now."
27:12;27:13;"- Now."
27:13;27:13;"- Now."
27:14;27:15;"- Now."
27:15;27:15;"- Do you remember that?"
27:15;27:16;"Wait, wait."
27:16;27:18;"- I actually don't, but I'm, I'm."
27:18;27:19;"- Really?"
27:19;27:21;"What were you doing in 2004, man?"
27:21;27:22;"- Was that four?"
27:22;27:23;"- Yeah."
27:23;27:25;"Were you delivering for Papa John's in '04?"
27:25;27:29;"- No, it was a reasonable question."
27:29;27:31;"I was living in San Francisco."
27:31;27:33;"I was probably listening to Neil Young."
27:33;27:35;"- All right."
27:35;27:36;"- Not a lot's changed."
27:36;27:36;"- Okay."
27:36;27:38;"Well, that's a good song."
27:38;27:40;"- I never like hit that New York, like early 2000."
27:40;27:43;"I like the strokes, but the other like New York early 2000, eh."
27:43;27:44;"- Right."
27:44;27:46;"- That's a whole separate conversation."
27:46;27:48;"- So that's the hook of Maps."
27:48;27:50;"Wait, they don't love you like I love you."
27:53;27:55;"So anyway, I don't know why I wrote that tweet."
27:55;28:00;"I just had, maybe I just thought back in 2011, I was like, what if it was more like, hold up."
28:00;28:01;"They don't love you like I love you."
28:01;28:02;"I don't know."
28:02;28:02;"I don't know what."
28:02;28:04;"- Wait, I'm sorry."
28:04;28:05;"The original lyric is what?"
28:05;28:07;"- Is wait, they don't love you like I love you."
28:07;28:09;"- And then your tweet was?"
28:09;28:11;"- Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
28:11;28:12;"'Cause I like, you know, in songs it's like, hold up."
28:12;28:13;"- Okay."
28:13;28:14;"- And there's like a pause."
28:14;28:16;"Hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
28:16;28:17;"- Hold up."
28:17;28:18;"- Yeah, maybe that's what I was thinking."
28:18;28:21;"It was hold up, they don't love you like I, I don't know what I was saying."
28:21;28:23;"- So you changed it from wait to hold up."
28:23;28:24;"- That's all I did in the tweet."
28:24;28:25;"- Okay."
28:25;28:32;"- And if that's all I did, I probably don't really deserve any credit, which is kind of amazing that some people thought that that's all I did."
28:32;28:37;"I mean, well, hey, somebody's got to write, change, wait to hold up, whatever."
28:37;28:43;"So I'm hanging with Diplo and I'm listening to his beat."
28:43;28:46;"And just to remind people, it was this looped."
28:46;28:48;"Now, remember this again?"
28:48;28:49;"- Yeah."
28:49;28:53;"- So Wes is looping that and he's like, you're going to write a hook?"
28:53;28:55;"And I said, you're damn right, I'm going to write a hook."
28:55;28:58;"So then I think back to this tweet, hold up, they don't love you like I love you."
28:58;29:00;"And I just think, okay, how could this go?"
29:00;29:04;"And then I write a hook that sounds like this."
29:04;29:07;"So this is the original demo that I made with Wes that day."
29:07;29:12;"I see it was added to my iTunes, March 18th, 2014."
29:12;29:13;"So we made this."
29:13;29:19;"And also just so people understand, a lot of times when you're working with somebody, you might not write the whole song that day."
29:19;29:25;"So you might say, make me a bounce of the song where the verses are empty, but have my hook on it in the meantime."
29:25;29:30;"So this is the original demo that we made, I guess, in March 2014."
29:55;29:57;"So that was the first demo that we made."
29:57;29:59;"So I took it home."
29:59;30:00;"I was listening to it a lot."
30:00;30:00;"Yeah."
30:00;30:01;"One question."
30:01;30:05;"In your version, it was, what a way to love the God above you?"
30:05;30:06;"Yeah, right."
30:06;30:08;"So the lyrics were changed in the final version."
30:08;30:14;"So in my version, I sang, can't you see there's no other God above you?"
30:14;30:17;"Which, it's funny, I was thinking about this."
30:17;30:19;"So can't you see there's no other God above you?"
30:19;30:22;"What a wicked way to treat the man who loves you."
30:22;30:26;"I sound very lethargic on the demo, but, you know, so then it's funny."
30:26;30:30;"So we're talking all about how like where ideas come, how songs are kind of intertextual."
30:30;30:33;"So it's funny, now that the song came out, I was thinking about it again."
30:33;30:35;"I was thinking about the original lyrics that I wrote."
30:35;30:37;"Can't you see there's no other God above you?"
30:37;30:37;"Yeah."
30:37;30:42;"And then I was thinking like, this sounds like something I would write, but I couldn't remember like, what was I thinking?"
30:42;30:43;"What is it?"
30:43;30:47;"It was just like, using the word wicked is very like biblical."
30:47;30:48;"And then I was like, oh, right."
30:48;30:50;"Where does no other God above you come from?"
30:50;30:52;"And then I realized that's from the Bible."
30:52;30:55;"You shall place no other God before me."
30:55;30:58;"That must have been kind of like where the phrase came from."
30:58;30:59;"Because, you know, there's only one God."
30:59;31:02;"Yeah, I didn't think the Bible referenced other gods, but that's besides the point."
31:02;31:06;"Well, because people used to be pagans."
31:06;31:09;"God came down to Abraham."
31:09;31:10;"You really should know this."
31:10;31:13;"I don't know my biblical history at all."
31:13;31:15;"But so she changed it to..."
31:15;31:18;"She changed it to, can't you see there's no other man above you?"
31:18;31:20;"What a wicked way to treat the girl who loves you."
31:20;31:25;"So that version there, look, from there, I came up with other versions."
31:25;31:29;"I've diploaded other versions, but that would have been, I believe, the first version that"
31:29;31:32;"Beyonce heard."
31:32;31:37;"So in some ways, that's like the point on the tree that leads to the final version."
31:37;31:41;"And then from there, a lot of other people got involved in writing the verses."
31:41;31:45;"Things changed, but essentially the hook stayed the same."
31:45;31:46;"Great melody."
31:46;31:47;"Thank you."
31:47;31:51;"But so it's interesting to me, like people get really hung up on like, so who wrote what?"
31:51;31:53;"Like, I know what I wrote, you know?"
31:53;31:59;"And in some ways I served as like a middle ground between the AAS and Beyonce."
31:59;32:02;"But it's funny to think about like, so what does writing really mean?"
32:02;32:03;"Because of course I'm like proud."
32:03;32:04;"I think I wrote a good hook."
32:04;32:08;"I think I had a good idea to like riff on the AAS."
32:08;32:11;"But then I was thinking about it like, now when I listen back to the demo, it sounds"
32:11;32:16;"different to me because like, she contextualized the song."
32:16;32:20;"So like, she's made this like great video where she's like, you know, bashing windows"
32:20;32:21;"and stuff."
32:21;32:24;"And I was like, when I wrote that, it wasn't directed at anybody."
32:24;32:25;"I was just kind of like songwriting."
32:25;32:28;"You know, like there's Vampire Weekend songs that have like very deep meaning to me that"
32:28;32:33;"feel like personal or like, that one I was kind of just like, I was kind of like songwriting."
32:33;32:34;"I was like, oh, this is a good hook."
32:34;32:37;"I wasn't thinking about anybody in particular."
32:37;32:42;"And the idea that those words now are contextualized by this album, by the video, by her as a"
32:42;32:44;"performer and a curator."
32:44;32:45;"I like it."
32:45;32:46;"I think it has deeper meaning."
32:46;32:51;"And it's also highly personal for her if you were to believe the narrative of the album."
32:51;32:52;"Yeah, right."
32:52;32:53;"Exactly."
32:53;32:54;"So I think -"
32:54;32:58;"Which makes it way more powerful to substitute God for guy or man."
32:58;32:59;"Yeah."
32:59;33:02;"If this had stayed a Vampire Weekend song, because then after I was listening to it for"
33:02;33:05;"a few months, I said to Wes, let's not make it a major lead song."
33:05;33:06;"I want this to be a Vampire Weekend song."
33:06;33:11;"And you're like, all right, but then things change."
33:11;33:14;"But when I think about it, like, it would have been a good Vampire Weekend song."
33:14;33:17;"You know, up until two weeks ago, I wasn't sure if it was going to make the album."
33:17;33:18;"You never know in these situations."
33:18;33:23;"So I was kind of like, thought maybe this would be a Vampire Weekend song."
33:23;33:27;"In which case I would have kept God and it might have - maybe I eventually would have"
33:27;33:29;"found a deeper personal meaning in it."
33:29;33:30;"Yeah."
33:30;33:31;"But -"
33:31;33:32;"Maybe not."
33:33;33:36;"And so then you get into this idea of like, all right, so I wrote this hook."
33:36;33:40;"It doesn't really make it - of course, I feel some sense of ownership over what I did, but"
33:40;33:43;"it doesn't like feel like my song."
33:43;33:46;"You really did bring a different resonance and meaning to it."
33:46;33:49;"So the idea that like people are trying to like, I think it's cool that like all these"
33:49;33:50;"things came together."
33:50;33:53;"It's like, it's a very modern way of a song coming together."
33:53;33:59;"But does that take away - 99% of the world will always hear those words and associate"
33:59;34:09;"it with Beyonce now."
34:09;34:14;"So then I was thinking about other songs that kind of have unusual paths where different"
34:14;34:16;"ideas come together."
34:16;34:18;"And in some ways, those are my favorite songs."
34:18;34:22;"So the Vampire Weekend song that kind of has the squirreliest path to the finished product"
34:22;34:26;"is probably our song Step, which was on the last album."
34:26;34:39;"So if anybody wonders what that sounds like, it sounds like this."
34:39;34:45;"So the way that that song started also was kind of like inspired by other ideas floating"
34:45;34:46;"around."
34:46;34:51;"The way that song really came together was there was this - you know Souls of Mischief?"
34:51;34:52;"No."
34:52;34:54;"They started in the early 90s Bay Area rap group."
34:54;34:58;"Probably their most famous song was 93 to Infinity."
34:58;35:00;"And this was like a B side."
35:00;35:03;"Or maybe it was never released until recently."
35:03;35:06;"But somehow like I heard this and I always really loved it."
35:06;35:08;"So this was the Souls of Mischief song."
35:08;35:28;"I think they were like teenagers from the early 90s called Step to My Girl."
35:28;35:55;"Just like good early 90s hip hop."
35:55;35:58;"I'm hearing the melody and the sax."
35:58;35:59;"Right, yeah."
35:59;36:14;"It's like a little different but that part's the same."
36:14;36:24;"Yeah, so I'd listen to this all the time and I guess like the melody of the sax kind of"
36:24;36:25;"seeped into my brain."
36:25;36:35;"And then the chorus, which is coming up, which is also samples."
36:35;36:45;"Yeah, so yeah, I'd listen to the song all the time."
36:45;36:47;"And I always thought it was like really beautiful."
36:47;36:48;"I didn't know what the samples were though."
36:48;36:50;"Like in the 90s you listen to it?"
36:50;36:55;"No, I probably found, I probably downloaded an mp3 of it in the early 2000s."
36:55;36:56;"Okay."
36:56;37:00;"So I didn't know too much about the origins of it."
37:00;37:06;"But I always just knew I really liked the song called Step to My Girl."
37:06;37:10;"Then at some point, sometimes you just start singing in your head."
37:10;37:15;"And I guess I sang something that kind of took part of the melody from the saxophone"
37:15;37:18;"and then took the line, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl."""
37:18;37:21;"There's always something I really liked about that line."
37:21;37:23;"Because it's not just like every, there's something about every time I see you in the"
37:23;37:25;"world, you always step to my girl."
37:25;37:26;"I don't know."
37:26;37:27;"I just liked it."
37:27;37:29;"So I kind of started writing, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to"
37:29;37:30;"my girl."
37:30;37:35;"And then the gloves are off."""
37:35;37:36;"So I always thought it was really pretty."
37:36;37:38;"So then start working on it."
37:38;37:41;"So then of course, when you're working on a song, you got to start saying like, ""Well,"
37:41;37:43;"okay, what am I actually referencing here?"""
37:44;37:49;"Because I believe good music is full of references, but you can't just like, you know, melodies"
37:49;37:51;"have to be cleared."
37:51;37:52;"That's how our law works."
37:52;37:55;"Other things don't, but melodies have to be cleared."
37:55;37:59;"So then I had to look up what Souls of Mischief had sampled."
37:59;38:05;"And what they sampled was a song called Aubrey by the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. from"
38:05;38:06;"the 70s."
38:06;38:07;"Oh, I'm familiar."
38:07;38:12;"So this is the original sample, the Grover Washington Jr. sample that that song's based"
38:12;38:18;"on."
38:18;38:21;"Gorgeous 70s production."
38:21;38:26;"Yeah, this is almost like new age meets smooth jazz."
38:26;38:29;"It's a weird period."
38:29;38:34;"There you go."
38:34;38:39;"""Gloves are off."""
38:39;38:41;"Yeah."
38:41;38:49;"So the melody goes other places, but you know, the main part is..."
38:49;38:51;"So you had to clear that."
38:51;38:55;"Well, yeah, so but so then we're like, all right, so they sampled Grover Washington Jr."
38:55;38:59;"playing his song called Aubrey."
38:59;39:04;"But then what of course I didn't know, but I found out was that this is a cover."
39:04;39:09;"So they sampled Grover Washington Jr. doing an instrumental cover of a song called Aubrey."
39:09;39:10;"Written by?"
39:10;39:11;"Written by Bread."
39:11;39:12;"Oh!"
39:12;39:14;"70s soft rock."
39:14;39:17;"We're getting even deeper into the 70s malaise here."
39:17;39:20;"So also like imagine like for me, I'm like, this song is like kind of based on Souls of"
39:20;39:21;"Mischief."
39:21;39:24;"But then little did I know that what I was actually basing the melody off was not Souls"
39:24;39:29;"of Mischief, was not even Grover Washington Jr., but was Bread."
39:29;39:34;"This like, real just kind of smooth 70s easeless."
39:34;39:36;"So this is the original song that the melody comes from."
39:36;39:41;"The name of that band is one of the most perfect examples of the name of the band describing"
39:41;39:42;"the sound of that band."
39:42;39:44;"Yeah, I mean, it's literally White Bread."
39:44;39:48;"It's White Bread."
39:48;39:53;"Like the band teacher at my high school, Mr. Jackson, he was like a real like old school"
39:53;39:55;"jazz head."
39:55;39:58;"And he and then we were in jazz band."
39:58;40:03;"And this is funny because this is at a predominantly white high school where you're in jazz band"
40:03;40:07;"like playing, you know, Night in Tunisia and like old standards."
40:07;40:11;"And he would always stop and be like, ""No, no, it's not swinging."
40:11;40:13;"It's sounding like White Bread."""
40:13;40:16;"And I just remember being like, I vaguely understood what he was saying, but it's like,"
40:16;40:21;"but like the other kids who are just like, basically just there after school to like"
40:21;40:25;"get a credit for when they're applying to college, just be like, ""Um, Mr. Jackson, I"
40:25;40:28;"have a field hockey practice coming up."""
40:28;40:30;"And he'd just be like, ""No."""
40:30;40:34;"It's like this like 14 year olds sounds like, oh, he'd always be like, sounds like White"
40:34;40:36;"Bread and creamed corn."
40:36;40:37;"Like what?"
40:37;40:40;"Anyway, Bread is very White Bread."
40:40;40:43;"And this is the original Aubrey that Grover Washington Jr. covered."
40:43;40:49;"This is what the original song sounds like."
40:49;40:52;"Love those 70s strings."
40:52;40:57;"I remember buying a Bread Greatest Hits in the dollar bin and really wanting to connect."
40:57;40:58;"I just couldn't."
40:58;40:59;"Really?"
40:59;41:00;"Yeah."
41:00;41:01;"So that's basically it."
41:01;41:17;"When you get down to it, what I interpolated in the song is, which is this part."
41:17;41:21;"""And Aubrey was her name, her name."""
41:21;41:26;"Just basically a three note interval at this point."
41:26;41:27;"Yeah."
41:27;41:32;"So it's kind of crazy."
41:32;41:34;"I mean, I guess it's fair though."
41:34;41:36;"That is what I based it on."
41:36;41:41;"So if you go look at the credits for Step, I believe I'm credited, Rostam's credited,"
41:41;41:44;"and the guy from Bread is credited."
41:44;41:46;"But then it's even deeper than that because..."
41:46;41:50;"So we talked to Souls of Mischief because of course we reached out to them and said,"
41:50;41:52;"""We're basing it off these elements of your song."""
41:52;41:55;"But it turned out the elements of the song that we were basing it off of were not actually"
41:55;41:57;"their intellectual property."
41:57;42:00;"So they were like, ""Well, we sampled Grover Washington Jr."" and then we're like, ""Well,"
42:00;42:01;"that's a cover of Bread."""
42:01;42:06;"""And Aubrey was her name, the gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out."""
42:06;42:09;"Yeah, that's the same interval."
42:09;42:15;"And then we said, ""Well, the other part that we kind of reference in our song is the chorus."""
42:15;42:18;"Because remember their song, the chorus goes, ""Every time I see you in the world, you always"
42:18;42:19;"step into my girl."""
42:19;42:22;"And they're like, ""Well, that's a sample too."""
42:22;42:25;"So it kind of sounded like a sample because if you go back and listen to it, it sounds"
42:25;42:36;"like they're cutting up records."
42:36;42:38;"So it sounded like that probably was a sample."
42:38;42:40;"I wasn't shocked, but I was like, ""All right, well, what's the sample?"""
42:40;42:47;"And they're like, ""Well, the sample is this not super well-known, not obscure, but not"
42:47;42:51;"super well-known New Jersey '90s rapper called YZ."""
42:51;42:55;"And they sampled his voice on their song, and it came from his song called ""Who's That"
42:55;42:56;"Girl?"""
42:56;43:20;"And it was like, ""Oh, I don't know."
43:20;43:46;"I don't know."""
43:47;44:16;", and it was like, ""Oh, I don't know."""
44:16;44:17;"You hear it?"
44:17;44:18;"Yeah, yeah."
44:18;44:19;"No, I heard it."
44:19;44:20;"You seem confused."
44:20;44:21;"No, no, no."
44:21;44:22;"It's like, I thought it would be like the chorus or something."
44:22;44:23;"No, it's just like a part of the verse."
44:23;44:24;"It's just like a random line."
44:24;44:25;"""Every time I see you in the..."""
44:25;44:26;"They made it a chorus."
44:26;44:27;"Yeah, that's interesting."
44:27;44:28;"Yeah."
44:28;44:29;"I thought it was like a chorus."
44:29;44:30;"Yeah."
44:30;44:31;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:31;44:32;"Yeah."
44:32;44:33;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:33;44:34;"Yeah."
44:34;44:35;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:35;44:36;"Yeah."
44:36;44:37;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:37;44:38;"Yeah."
44:38;44:39;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:39;44:40;"Yeah."
44:40;44:41;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:41;44:42;"Yeah."
44:42;44:43;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:43;44:44;"Yeah."
44:44;44:45;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:45;44:46;"Yeah."
44:46;44:47;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:47;44:48;"Yeah."
44:48;44:49;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:49;44:50;"Yeah."
44:50;44:51;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:51;44:52;"Yeah."
44:52;44:53;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:53;44:54;"Yeah."
44:54;44:55;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:55;44:56;"Yeah."
44:56;44:57;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:57;44:58;"Yeah."
44:58;44:59;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
44:59;45:00;"Yeah."
45:00;45:01;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:01;45:02;"Yeah."
45:02;45:03;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:03;45:04;"Yeah."
45:04;45:05;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:05;45:06;"Yeah."
45:06;45:07;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:07;45:08;"Yeah."
45:08;45:09;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:09;45:10;"Yeah."
45:10;45:11;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:11;45:12;"Yeah."
45:12;45:13;"I thought it was like a part of the verse."
45:13;45:14;"Yeah."

45:56;45:58;"I like to think about the whole Beyonce thing where people like, ""Oh, all these different"
45:58;46:01;"- she stole this line."""
46:01;46:05;"It's kind of like, ""No, it's actually pretty cool that all these different people came"
46:05;46:07;"together and she still made the song her own."""
46:07;46:11;"I would like to think that the Vampire Weekend song, we made our own."
46:11;46:14;"You know, like at the end of the day, I can play you all that stuff and hopefully you"
46:14;46:18;"still listen to Vampire Weekend and that song sounds like us."
46:18;46:24;"You know, we've never tried to hide the references in it, but writing a song like that is not"
46:24;46:25;"easier."
46:25;46:26;"You know what I mean?"
46:26;46:27;"Of course."
46:27;46:30;"Writing a song that's not easier than sitting down at the piano."
46:30;46:31;"It's just as hard."
46:31;46:36;"Like God might give you a melody when you sit at the piano and you still got to do something"
46:36;46:37;"with it."
46:37;46:40;"If bread gives you a melody, you still got to figure out how to write a song around it."
46:40;46:41;"No, that's fascinating."
46:41;46:46;"I mean, yeah, like that experience of writing music and being like, ""Did I write this?"""
46:46;46:49;"I remember there's a story of Paul McCartney wrote yesterday."
46:49;46:50;"He woke up from a dream."
46:50;46:51;"Oh, right."
46:51;46:52;"And he wrote ""Scrambled Eggs."""
46:52;46:53;"And yeah."
46:53;46:54;"""Scrambled Eggs."""
46:55;46:59;"And then he played, you know, yesterday for friends of his for the next few days being"
46:59;47:00;"like, ""Did I write this?"
47:00;47:05;"Or is this some old song that's in all of our subconsciousnesses that like I somehow..."""
47:05;47:07;"And everyone's like, ""No, I've never heard that before."""
47:07;47:09;"And eventually he was like, ""I guess I wrote it."""
47:09;47:12;"And then it sounded like a song that everybody had heard before and became a song that everybody"
47:12;47:13;"heard."
47:13;47:14;"Yeah."
47:14;47:18;"And truthfully, a lot of good songs are rooted in old folk melodies or something."
47:18;47:19;"It's not really a big deal."
47:19;47:23;"But anyway, that's the convoluted story of how Step came together."
47:23;47:24;"Not a million miles away from..."
47:24;47:25;"No."
47:25;47:26;"Hold up."
47:26;47:27;"But I never play Vampire Weekend on the show."
47:27;47:32;"So I'm going to play Step in its entirety now."
47:32;47:33;"Here's Vampire Weekend."
47:33;47:34;"Who?"
47:34;47:36;"With their hit song, ""Step."""
47:36;47:40;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kanin."

55:49;55:51;"then became a rap song again."
55:51;55:52;"It's the circle of life."
55:52;55:55;"I was thinking about how, you know,"
55:55;55:59;"most music is based on shared melodies historically,"
55:59;56:02;"and how people are still,"
56:02;56:05;"even about almost 40 years into the hip hop era,"
56:05;56:08;"get kind of confused by how people might, like,"
56:08;56:10;"recontextualize an idea or a melody or a lyric."
56:10;56:12;"But I was thinking back in history,"
56:12;56:14;"this is something that happened a lot."
56:14;56:16;"Folk melodies where people would do"
56:16;56:18;"whatever they wanted with them."
56:18;56:18;"- Right."
56:18;56:19;"- So, I was thinking about a certain song"
56:19;56:22;"that most of us are familiar with and its origins."
56:22;56:24;"People might not know this song."
56:24;56:25;"Have you ever heard of the song called"

56:28;56:29;"- I don't know. I don't think so."
56:29;56:33;"- Well, this is a song from the 18th century."
56:33;56:35;"It was very popular in London."
56:35;56:39;"And it was the official song of the Anacreontic Society,"
56:39;56:42;"which was a gentleman's club of amateur musicians in London."
56:42;56:42;"- Yeah."
56:42;56:45;"- It's this kind of goofy song,"
56:45;56:48;"kind of referencing old, like, Greek mythology."
56:48;56:51;"They're talking about, like, Venus and Bacchus"
56:51;56:53;"and all these crazy things happening."
56:53;56:55;"It's almost like the song about, like,"
56:55;56:57;"a big, crazy free-for-all with all the Greek gods."
56:57;56:58;"- Yeah."
56:58;57:01;"- Obviously, we don't have recordings from the 18th century,"
57:01;57:05;"but I thought I might play a version that we found."

57:08;57:11;"London gentleman's club song, ""To Anacreon in Heaven."""
57:11;57:14;"And this is sung by a guy named Douglas Jimerson."
57:14;57:16;"So, I just want to play this for people."

01:00:36;01:00:37;"Cause the country is..."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"- Come on, get it on."
01:00:38;01:00:43;"What are those lyrics even?"
01:00:43;01:00:52;"- Well, on that note, let's play a new anthem for, what would your country be called?"
01:00:52;01:00:57;"Like, let's imagine it's sixth grade and the teacher's like, all right, Jake, like, what's"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"your country called?"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"It's like, probably like Jake land."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- Yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:07;"Or like I was really into the Yankees, like Mattingly land."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Really rolls off the tongue."
01:01:08;01:01:13;"- The people's Republic of Mattingly, North Mattingly."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"- Don Mattingly is president for life."
01:01:15;01:01:19;"- Mrs. Napolitano, Jake Longstreth."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"I worked really hard on my project."
01:01:20;01:01:24;"My country is called the Democratic People's Republic of Mattingly."
01:01:24;01:01:29;"And our national anthem is pour some sugar on me."
01:01:29;01:01:56;"- Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:01:56;01:02:24;"- Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:02:24;01:02:45;"- Pour some sugar on me."
01:02:45;01:03:14;"- Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:03:14;01:03:43;"- Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on."
01:03:43;01:04:08;"- Pour some sugar on me."
01:04:08;01:04:15;"- That was pour some sugar on me, the national anthem of Jake's sixth grade country."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"- Mattingly land."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"- Mattingly land."
01:04:20;01:04:26;"We're now joined in the studio by our good friend, superstar producer, Ariel Rekshai."
01:04:26;01:04:27;"What's up, Ariel?"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- What's up?"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"What's up, Jake?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"- What's up, man?"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"- Good to finally have you on Time Crisis."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"- Thank you."
01:04:33;01:04:37;"- I know you've been on Hymetime before, also on Apple Music."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- Also in real life."
01:04:39;01:04:42;"- Also in real life because you are a producer."
01:04:42;01:04:47;"I think I first met you because you co-produced with Ross Tham, Modern Vampires of the City."
01:04:47;01:04:48;"- That's true."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"That's where we met."
01:04:49;01:04:54;"- Classic Vampire Weekend album, our last album, but you're also known for producing"
01:04:54;01:05:01;"Haim, Cass McCombs, Sky Ferreira, Solange losing you."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"You were one of the producers on that, right?"
01:05:02;01:05:05;"- I think technically I got mixing credit on that one."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"- Okay."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"He's a producer."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"He's mixing."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"He's out there producing, songwriting."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"You produced Hey There, Delilah."
01:05:12;01:05:13;"- Yeah."
01:05:13;01:05:16;"- I mean, you've done a lot of different stuff."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"- What do they say?"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"You gotta be able to shoot from anywhere in the court."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"- Exactly."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"So today we've been breaking down different songs, talking about how songs come together."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"- Okay, right."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"- The elements that go into making a song, sometimes there's interpolations, but sometimes"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"it's also just different people collaborating in a studio."
01:05:33;01:05:37;"The Beyonce one started with me and Diplo collaborating in a studio."
01:05:37;01:05:43;"And one song that's definitely one of the high points of your resume is Usher Climax."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"- Proud moment for me."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"- Major song."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"You know that song, Jake?"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"- Yeah, I love it."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"It's great."
01:05:49;01:05:50;"- It's a great song."
01:05:50;01:05:53;"Many people's favorite, definitely one of the top Usher songs."
01:05:53;01:05:56;"And just when it came out, it was like nobody'd heard anything like it."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"So technically that song is produced by you and Diplo."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"- That's right."
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Wes and I both had the same idea."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"We were cutting straight to the pop tracks, up-tempo."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"We're like, ""We're gonna go work with this superstar pop artist."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"We wanna, let's get one of those."""
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- Right."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Big song."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"- Yeah, big song."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"We're playing stuff and nothing's really lighting up."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"And at one point, I just randomly, I started playing a track and I'm pretty much playing"
01:06:17;01:06:18;"out of Wes."
01:06:18;01:06:20;"Wes had a lot of the starter material."
01:06:20;01:06:21;"- Yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"- And I was gonna work off of whatever we kind of decided to, whatever resonated."
01:06:24;01:06:29;"So I start playing something and Usher, I could see him light up a little bit."
01:06:29;01:06:32;"He hears this little bit of music and he kind of lights up and all of a sudden there was"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"eye contact."
01:06:33;01:06:40;"And then the beat drops and it turns into this kind of house-y type song."
01:06:40;01:06:41;"And he lost it again."
01:06:41;01:06:46;"And then we flipped through a bunch more stuff and then it was sort of a fail for a little"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"while there."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"And I brought the session."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"I have the session."
01:06:51;01:06:55;"I thought maybe I could demonstrate a little bit of what he heard."
01:06:55;01:06:59;"I don't have the actual original, original demo of the song."
01:06:59;01:07:02;"So I'm just sort of doing a little approximation of what he heard."
01:07:02;01:07:07;"And this is the session for the actual finished product of Climax."
01:07:07;01:07:15;"So he heard this bit."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"At this moment, he was kind of intrigued."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- He liked the little like bleep, bleepy bloops."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"- Yeah, he was like, okay, okay."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Now, you know, that's what I'm talking about."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"I haven't heard that yet."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"And then this is sort of an approximation of the groove and like what happened was the"
01:07:27;01:07:36;"song."
01:07:36;01:07:37;"- And he didn't like this."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"- This is where we lost him."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"- Right."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"He was like, that was cool, but now you're on some like Euro house, whatever."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- Yeah."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"I'll call Max Martin if I want that."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- Right."
01:07:46;01:07:47;"- You know?"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"- Yeah."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"- You guys are trash."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- But that was good that you noticed what he liked."
01:07:51;01:07:54;"- Well, I was very focused and it was..."
01:07:54;01:07:55;"But that is it too."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"I mean, I read, you know, music is a difficult language to talk about."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"- Right."
01:08:00;01:08:03;"Sometimes you hear something, it's not always easy to say, you know what?"
01:08:03;01:08:04;"I like part of it."
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Here's what we have to do."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"You just have a weird feeling."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"You're like, I kind of like something about..."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Yeah."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"- Yeah."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"It's all about reading body language and understanding, you know, everybody in the"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"room understanding each other."
01:08:14;01:08:16;"And it takes time to get to that point."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"And you don't always have that kind of time."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"So that's when things just don't work out."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"So at any rate, we knew he didn't want it to be that tempo."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"So Wes and I decided let's halftime it."
01:08:25;01:08:28;"So we took that main part and then I went to the other room and I started to..."
01:08:28;01:08:32;"There's a sort of a root note that's going throughout that whole thing, a drone."
01:08:32;01:08:42;"I started to build chords around it."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"This is as much, if not less than what we had, you know?"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- Right."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"But you started to give it some more harmonic shape."
01:08:48;01:08:56;"- And then Wes came in with a really, really simple halftime."
01:08:56;01:08:57;"Like couldn't be more bare bone."
01:08:57;01:08:58;"- Right."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Very simple, minimalist."
01:09:00;01:09:01;"- Got about this much going."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"- Yeah."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"- At some point had another opportunity to play it for us or play it for him."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"And he just started getting really into it."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"You could just see that he was really excited."
01:09:09;01:09:12;"And we were just in the room playing it just like we are right here."
01:09:12;01:09:14;"And he's about as close to me as you are."
01:09:14;01:09:19;"And he just starts riffing acapella."
01:09:19;01:09:23;"And it just happened to be in this range."
01:09:23;01:09:28;"- Like very high, delicate."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- Just a beautiful falsetto."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- Yeah, falsetto, yeah."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"- And live and direct, it's just really, really moving."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"- Right."
01:09:34;01:09:36;"- And unlike anybody I had worked with before."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"- Because this is before you met me."
01:09:38;01:09:39;"- That's right."
01:09:39;01:09:40;"That's right."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"That was just before."
01:09:41;01:09:46;"And so after writing two verses and two choruses, where do we go with it next?"
01:09:46;01:09:52;"Well, we came up with some chords, but we wanted to make it just really epic and beautiful."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"Kind of pull out the violins."
01:09:53;01:09:59;"But we don't know anyone who's basic enough to just pull out the average violin."
01:09:59;01:10:04;"So we called our friend, your friend, all of our friends, Nico Muhly, who put together"
01:10:04;01:10:05;"a really nice arrangement."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"- Nico Muhly, legendary."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"- Legendary."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- Arranger, composer."
01:10:10;01:10:12;"- My man is a legend."
01:10:12;01:10:17;"- So what did he do on climax?"
01:10:17;01:10:27;"So this is Nico bringing that kind of new classical Philip Glass energy."
01:10:27;01:10:30;"So play that in context."
01:10:30;01:10:33;"Very nice."
01:10:33;01:10:36;"- Just classy."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"- Beautiful."
01:10:39;01:10:49;"Well, Ariel, thanks so much for sharing your story."
01:10:49;01:10:51;"- My pleasure, guys."
01:10:51;01:10:53;"- That's the story of how Climax came together."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Now we've got to listen to the whole song now."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"- Run it."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"- Here's Usher with Climax."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"- Run it, Jake."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"- So what did you do on climax?"
01:10:59;01:11:00;"- I wrote a song."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"- You wrote a song?"
01:11:01;01:11:02;"- Yeah."
01:11:02;01:11:03;"- What did you write?"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"- I wrote a song."

01:17:57;01:18:00;"I like that little break there."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"- Lo-fi."
01:18:01;01:18:02;"- It's lo-fi."
01:18:02;01:18:03;"That's more Jake's Alley."
01:18:03;01:18:06;"- Yeah, I would have thought this was like '93."
01:18:06;01:18:09;"- This is like some weird '93 cassette vibe."
01:18:09;01:18:10;"All right."

01:18:13;01:18:15;"That was from the next thing."
01:18:15;01:18:21;"So I kind of came up with an interpretation of what the show would be like with that theme song."
01:18:21;01:18:26;"And what I thought of was that Seinfeld is entirely set in virtual reality,"
01:18:26;01:18:30;"and Jerry is an abstract impressionist painter and a performance artist"
01:18:30;01:18:36;"struggling to make his way in an immersive second-life world-style version of New York City."
01:18:36;01:18:37;"- Based on that one?"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"- Yeah."
01:18:38;01:18:39;"No?"
01:18:39;01:18:40;"- I'm not getting that."
01:18:40;01:18:41;"- All right."

01:19:00;01:19:05;"This is kind of like Nintendo."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"- Yeah."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"That's sort of what I came up with."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"I said, you know, this would be for like a Seinfeld prequel."
01:19:11;01:19:17;"The year is 1987, and Jerry is a video game designer working for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Power Glove,"
01:19:17;01:19:22;"but he's forced to become a comedian after getting fired because his neighbor, Cram,"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"ruins the glove by using it to lose the contest."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"[laughter]"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"By using it to masturbate."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"- I like the--oh, yeah."
01:19:29;01:19:30;"No, I got your reference."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"- Okay."
01:19:31;01:19:32;"- Loud and clear."
01:19:32;01:19:34;"- And then actually--yeah."
01:19:34;01:19:38;"So I got to roll out, but thanks so much for having me on the show."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"- Oh, thanks for coming, man."
01:19:39;01:19:44;"I'm really glad that, you know, we went from being kind of each other's worst enemies"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"to friends and collaborators."
01:19:46;01:19:50;"And you can come on the show and, like, help facilitate kind of a cool segment"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"talking about demos, and it was really on topic."
01:19:52;01:19:53;"And, yeah, thanks, man."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"It was awesome."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"- Thanks."
01:19:55;01:19:58;"I put a lot of effort into it, and I think it went over really well."
01:19:58;01:19:59;"- Absolutely."
01:19:59;01:20:00;"- All right."
01:20:00;01:20:01;"Nice to meet you, Jake."

01:20:04;01:20:06;"- Bye."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"- Okay."
01:20:07;01:20:11;"I did want to play one demo that I came up with myself,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"and I spent quite a bit of time putting it together,"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"but I think it's going to really delight you."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"- Oh, you made your own Seinfeld demo?"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"- Yeah, I spent a few days just, you know, I sort of hunkered down in the lab,"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"and, you know, I think I came up with something pretty great."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"- Oh, awesome."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Let's hear it."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"- Sure."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"- Wait, wait."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Wait, did you make this?"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"- Yeah, this is--I completely composed this myself."
01:20:35;01:20:38;"- Wait, this is that Rick Astley song."
01:20:38;01:20:41;"- Yeah, I just Rick Rolled you on your own show."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"- You Rick Rolled me on my own show?"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"- Yes, this was happening right now."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"- Get out."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"- What?"
01:20:46;01:20:47;"- Get out."

01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's not funny."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"I--oh, ow, man."
01:20:54;01:20:58;"I was really starting to like you, man, and I really loved the segment,"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"and then you come on and Rick Roll me on my own show."
01:21:00;01:21:03;"The disrespect--I mean, people talk about Donald Trump"

01:31:32;01:31:36;"is Oxford Comma, which for one shining week in 2008,"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"was number 38 in the UK."
01:31:38;01:31:44;"So that's my only taste of that top 40 life."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- Wow."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"- Number 38."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"- That's amazing."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"- 38 special."
01:31:48;01:31:49;"- Different worlds."
01:31:49;01:31:53;"- So anyway, Hold Up is not my song."
01:31:53;01:31:56;"I'm one of many people who put this together."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"It's Beyonce's song now."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"But at the time of recording,"
01:31:59;01:32:02;"this is number four in the iTunes store."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"So it's a very special moment for me."
01:32:04;01:32:07;"So obviously, you can't say anything bad about this song."

01:35:47;01:35:48;"- It's a great song."
01:35:48;01:35:48;"- All right."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"- I mean, I don't, it's not like EDM, you know?"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"That's it."
01:35:51;01:35:53;"I mean, like with the Rihanna and the Calvin Harris."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"- This song has a good message."
01:35:55;01:35:56;"- What the Calvin Harris did?"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"- No, hold up."
01:35:58;01:35:59;"- Oh, this does."
01:35:59;01:35:59;"- Yeah. - Right, so people haven't"
01:35:59;01:36:01;"heard this song, we didn't talk about it that much before."
01:36:01;01:36:04;"Apparently people assume it's directed at Jay-Z."
01:36:04;01:36:06;"- Oh, I assume that it's not."
01:36:06;01:36:09;"- I mean, you always gotta give artists a little bit of--"
01:36:09;01:36:10;"- Leeway. - Leeway."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"- What do you think it is then?"
01:36:12;01:36:15;"For me, when I heard this song--"
01:36:15;01:36:19;"- Regardless of who it's about, she's letting you in."
01:36:19;01:36:21;"She's just a narrative."
01:36:21;01:36:24;"- Yeah, but knowing that like the popular narrative"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"of the album, it being directed at Jay-Z,"
01:36:26;01:36:29;"when I heard this song, I was like, all the more powerful."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"And she's usually so sort of like cold"
01:36:31;01:36:34;"and sort of like our earlier guest"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"described her as like cyborg-like."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"This was a cool--"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"- Because she's just so talented."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"- Yeah, just so like, that thing of like a pop star"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"is so talented."
01:36:43;01:36:44;"- This is vulnerable."
01:36:44;01:36:45;"- Exactly, exactly."
01:36:45;01:36:46;"- It's fragile."
01:36:46;01:36:49;"- Instead of it being like perfectly calibrated,"
01:36:49;01:36:50;"this is vulnerable."
01:36:50;01:36:52;"So anyway, I thought it was powerful,"
01:36:52;01:36:55;"thinking it was about Jay-Z, but apparently it's maybe not."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"- Has she officially denied it?"
01:36:57;01:36:58;"- No, no, no, of course she didn't deny it,"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"but that's also what makes this song powerful."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"And that's why, like when we talk about writing"
01:37:01;01:37:05;"and credit and stuff, even the parts that I wrote,"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"it has a much stronger resonance in the context of her album"
01:37:08;01:37:09;"or how she interpreted it."
01:37:09;01:37:10;"- Of course."
01:37:10;01:37:13;"- This song wouldn't have fit on Vampire Weekend,"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Modern Vampire's album."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"Like it wouldn't have any resonance."
01:37:15;01:37:18;"Here, she took some, she really made it."
01:37:18;01:37:20;"And with the verses, it has so much more personality."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Anyway, Beyonce got two songs."
01:37:22;01:37:25;"- Mario, but what's the positive message?"
01:37:25;01:37:26;"- Okay, you know what?"
01:37:26;01:37:26;"I spoke too soon."
01:37:26;01:37:27;"It's not a positive message."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"What I meant to say is there was like a strong narrative."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"It was fragile, vulnerable."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"It was, as opposed to any EDM song,"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"it's kind of a feeling of,"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"we're living, it's Saturday night."
01:37:38;01:37:38;"- Exactly."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"- Yeah."
01:37:39;01:37:41;"- Right, well, they're all about real human emotions,"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"but like this is a universe,"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"everybody's probably had a feeling,"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"like a hold up, they don't love you,"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"like I love you feeling,"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"but we're thinking about ourselves"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"by hearing Beyonce's personal story."
01:37:52;01:37:53;"- That's right."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"- And that's different than other pop music."
01:37:55;01:37:58;"Number three, also Beyonce, ""Formation."""
01:37:58;01:38:00;"You know this one?"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"- Yeah."
01:38:01;01:38:02;"- She did this one at the Super Bowl."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"- I listened to the record the other day."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"- Oh, right, right, yes, you've heard it."
01:38:05;01:38:06;"This is a great song."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"- Congrats on number four, Ezra."
01:38:07;01:38:08;"- Thank you."
01:38:08;01:38:09;"And that's it."
01:38:09;01:38:11;"That's how time works."
01:38:11;01:38:12;"You get your moment at number four,"

01:41:46;01:41:48;"I was very confused by that."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Right."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"A lot of people carry hot sauce in their bags."
01:41:51;01:41:52;"Like the packets."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"Right."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"Or like a full Tabasco bottle."
01:41:55;01:41:56;"Sometimes."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"So like fire sauce from T-Bowl."
01:41:58;01:42:01;"We brought hot sauce back from Hawaii."
01:42:01;01:42:02;"Oh, that's true."
01:42:02;01:42:03;"You did?"
01:42:03;01:42:04;"Yeah."
01:42:04;01:42:05;"What kind?"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"Remember we got that Kawhi Juice Company."

01:42:07;01:42:09;"Shout out to the Kawhi Juice Company."
01:42:09;01:42:10;"They're making good hot sauce."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"They've been using it?"

01:42:12;01:42:13;"Yeah, yeah."
01:42:13;01:42:14;"We finished our bottle."

01:42:15;01:42:16;"I got really into ghee on that trip."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Oh, using ghee to cook."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"Yeah."
01:42:19;01:42:20;"We all went to the three."

01:42:25;01:42:26;"The number two song."
01:42:26;01:42:27;"The top five is all over the place."
01:42:27;01:42:32;"The number two song is a, I guess you would call it a country song by Florida Georgia Line."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"Have you heard of them, Jake?"
01:42:33;01:42:34;"No."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"People kind of refer to these guys as bro country."

01:42:41;01:42:42;"Oh, okay."
01:42:42;01:42:43;"And they get laid."
01:42:43;01:42:46;"I don't know if it's like Bernie Bros or something."
01:42:46;01:42:50;"People call them bro country, I guess because they're probably just like a couple of chill"
01:42:50;01:42:53;"dudes who like to crack a brew or something."
01:42:53;01:42:54;"I'm not that familiar with them."
01:42:54;01:42:58;"I know they've had some big hits, but the song is called Holy, but it's like H period,"
01:42:58;01:43:00;"O period, L period, Y period."

01:44:34;01:44:36;"- This is good Heartland music, man."
01:44:36;01:44:36;"Well, first of all."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"- It is the most."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"- I don't think this would be labeled as Christian rock,"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"but you know, people have said in the past"
01:44:42;01:44:46;"that the only difference between a Christian song"
01:44:46;01:44:50;"and a secular song is just who the object of affection is."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"- Yeah, yeah, sure."

01:45:02;01:45:04;"then it becomes a religious song."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"- Yeah, I mean, you can do classy religious music."
01:45:06;01:45:08;"- I mean, a lot of the best music of all time"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"is religious music."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"- Yeah, and pop music."

01:45:12;01:45:13;"- Yeah."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"- Do you like Mellencamp?"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"- No, I'm not a Mellencamp fan."
01:45:15;01:45:16;"- Really?"
01:45:16;01:45:16;"- Oh yeah."
01:45:16;01:45:17;"- Mellencamp's."
01:45:17;01:45:21;"- But see, I love wordplay."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"A lot of my favorite lyricists are like, you know,"

01:46:00;01:46:03;"because you didn't understand the acronym."
01:46:03;01:46:06;"- No, I understood it the first time the chorus came in."

01:46:14;01:46:16;"- Ooh, man."

01:49:13;01:49:15;"if in fact they are like bro country"
01:49:15;01:49:16;"and Drake is kind of like bro rap,"

01:49:36;01:49:38;"but like bro country, as I understand it,"
