00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. This week we talk Rockabilia, the Grateful Dead's latest"
00:08;00:13;"auction at Sotheby's. We're joined by Kellef Hasane to talk about his new book"
00:13;00:22;"about musical genres. All this plus Coldplay, BTS, Ed Sheeran, Elton John,"
00:22;00:32;"Dua Lipa, and Why Don't We. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:23;"Time Crisis back again, episode 159 if you're counting. We were just discussing"
01:23;01:28;"the fact that we have well over 300 hours of content on this program, which I"
01:28;01:32;"guess is a lot in one in a sense and also not a lot in another sense."
01:32;01:38;"Yeah, compared to other shows it's pretty modest. Anyway, we got a great guest this"
01:38;01:44;"week. We got Kellef Hasane, major rock critic. Actually I shouldn't call him rock"
01:44;01:50;"critic, he's music critic. In fact, he's got a new book out called Major Labels of"
01:50;01:55;"History of Popular Music in Seven Genres, only one of which is rock. The other are"
01:55;02:01;"R&B, country, punk, hip-hop, dance, and pop. So we'll have plenty to talk about with him."
02:01;02:05;"Although rock was the first chapter. Rock was the first chapter and we don't want"
02:05;02:08;"to spoil the book so we might have to focus a little bit on rock. But in the"
02:08;02:13;"meantime, speaking of rock, one of the pillars of this program, there was just a"
02:13;02:18;"Grateful Dead auction. It's making some waves on the TC thread. This was an"
02:18;02:23;"interesting auction because there was a lot of like pretty like mundane gear. I"
02:23;02:31;"mean some cool stuff, but like pedals, road cases, random speakers. Pedals seem"
02:31;02:35;"cool. If I was gonna go in on anything, you know, obviously the guitars are gonna"
02:35;02:40;"cost a fortune. Yeah, there are a couple of guitars. And actually as it turns out, the pedals are gonna cost a fortune too."
02:40;02:44;"But I guess everything cost a fortune. Wait, is there a way to look up the final"
02:44;02:50;"prices? Probably if you go to Sotheby's.com/gratefuldead. Okay, we can see"
02:50;02:54;"how much everything sold for now. Yeah, I looked at it ahead of time. I think we"
02:54;02:58;"texted. I think I was in Hawaii still. I was like, dude, are you gonna go in on"
02:58;03:03;"this Q-tron pedal? Well, it was interesting to see like what was already"
03:03;03:09;"kind of popping off. Like the pedals were already kind of going for a lot and it"
03:09;03:15;"was unclear what a good deal would be. I mean, it ain't cheap, none of it. And I'd"
03:15;03:19;"had a slight, I don't know if it's quite as cool, but a few years ago there was a"
03:19;03:24;"Neil Young auction. Also like a major auction house was doing it. Just Neil"
03:24;03:29;"like just getting rid of a lot of stuff. It was like music gear, his like train"
03:29;03:34;"sets, random clothes. That auction was funny because it was a little bit like,"
03:34;03:39;"it had a tiny bit of like this exciting rock history moment of like Neil Young"
03:39;03:43;"going to auction with some of his legendary gear. But then it also had a"
03:43;03:47;"little bit of just like a yard sale vibe. I might be wrong here, but I have a vague"
03:47;03:53;"memory of like scrolling through the the Neil Young auction catalog and I feel"
03:53;03:57;"like getting to a certain point and it was just kind of like plaid wool rich"
03:57;04:03;"shirt circa 2005, size large. I'm pretty sure there was just like some kind of"
04:03;04:08;"like newish clothes. It wasn't even like, you know, t-shirt that Neil wore on stage"
04:08;04:13;"that you can see in this photograph with CSNY 1972. Some of it really did seem a"
04:13;04:17;"little bit like he like looked through his closet and just like pair of jeans."
04:17;04:21;"Yeah, like a plaid shirt that someone gave him for Christmas that they bought"
04:21;04:30;"at like Costco in like 2002. A Kirkland signature button-down shirt with tags"
04:30;04:34;"still on. Does have a nice liner though. It's pretty warm. It's got that nice"
04:34;04:40;"liner. It's pretty warm. Neil's never worn it, but he did touch it when he opened"
04:40;04:46;"the gift. He immediately placed it in his closet where it's been ever since. Do you"
04:46;04:49;"think if they were auctioning off like straight up like Jerry Garcia's"
04:49;04:56;"underwear? Like people would buy it. I mean somebody would. I mean I remember"
04:56;05:02;"there was another Grateful Dead auction maybe a year or two ago and I'm pretty"
05:02;05:08;"sure in that auction there was something almost as mundane as like Jerry's shorts."
05:08;05:13;"Like a pair of black shorts. Well yeah I feel like yeah we talked about that on"
05:13;05:18;"the air. I think we did talk about it. Just a big black t-shirt. Oh right we were"
05:18;05:22;"talking about framing it. I'm sure it is framed somewhere now. I mean this auction,"
05:22;05:26;"this more recent Sotheby's auction had a little more like sense of like history."
05:26;05:33;"Although one of the things that people talked about a lot was that a t-shirt"
05:33;05:38;"was sold which is now the most expensive t-shirt ever sold. Or at least the most"
05:38;05:42;"expensive rock t-shirt ever sold. And this t-shirt in this recent auction was"
05:42;05:49;"from 1967 and it sold for $17,640. The shirt was designed by graphic artist"
05:49;05:55;"and Hells Angel Alan Gutt Turk and sold for nearly twice as much as a 1979 Led"
05:55;06:01;"Zeppelin shirt which went for $10,000 during an eBay auction in 2011. And when"
06:01;06:06;"you look at this shirt it's like just like old yellow shirt. Pretty simple"
06:06;06:12;"Grateful Dead logo on it. It looks really like new. Like it's been sitting in a box"
06:12;06:19;"for like 54 years. It's in good shape. We know the guy who bought it. It was or"
06:19;06:23;"it's like it's public. His name's Bo Bushnell and he operates the Outlaw"
06:23;06:28;"Archive Instagram page which documents 1960s Motorcycle Club artifacts and"
06:28;06:33;"ephemera. Oh yeah I think I've I think I know somebody in common with this guy"
06:33;06:36;"actually. And he bought it to keep the memory of Gutt Turk alive and keep his"
06:36;06:39;"history under one roof. That's interesting. So this guy's not even"
06:39;06:43;"coming at it from the dead angle particularly. Right. More the motorcycle"
06:43;06:48;"history. It's almost like an institution bought it. Less of like a random"
06:48;06:53;"individual. The Museum of the Hells Angels. Kind of. Do you know it was it was"
06:53;06:57;"the dead that recommended to the stones that they use the Hells Angels for"
06:57;07:02;"security at Altamont. Really? Mm-hmm. I was just reading this book when I was in"
07:02;07:06;"Hawaii called Season of the Witch and it's like a history at San Francisco"
07:06;07:11;"from 67 to 82 which is a really fascinating window. Oh wow. And anyway in"
07:11;07:16;"the Altamont chapter the stones like couldn't find anyone to do security and"
07:16;07:20;"the dead were like use the Hells Angels they're cool. Wow I feel like the dead"
07:20;07:25;"kind of they made it out pretty unscathed from that situation. Yeah. I"
07:25;07:28;"never even knew that you don't see too much press saying that it was"
07:28;07:32;"specifically the dead who made the fatal decision to recommend the Hells Angels."
07:32;07:39;"There was also a Grateful Dead shirt at auction that sold for $15,000 that was"
07:39;07:46;"specifically from the famous Cornell 77 show. To give you context around would"
07:46;07:50;"someone buy Jerry's underwear there's a shirt it's a it's not a dead shirt it's"
07:50;07:57;"a Fillmore West shirt that Pigpen wore on stage. That sold for $21,000."
07:57;08:03;"Whoa wait but that's more than this dead shirt which set the auction. Well I don't"
08:03;08:06;"know if maybe that's considered something different because it's not this"
08:06;08:11;"was just a shirt worn by. It wasn't a dead shirt. No it's a Fillmore West shirt."
08:11;08:17;"It's literally just a shirt he wore. From like the 60s. Yeah. Okay so that's a"
08:17;08:24;"slightly separate subcategory of ephemera. I wonder if like yeah I mean"
08:24;08:30;"obviously deadheads are a specific breed I don't know how well a Sotheby's auction"
08:30;08:39;"would do for like anybody else. Like we have this huge cache of early Green Day"
08:39;08:46;"memorabilia from 89 to 93 going up in Sotheby's. Am I I mean if someone had"
08:46;08:51;"like a like a Green Day shirt. Will that happen in our lifetime? Oh for sure but I'm just yeah imagine like the"
08:51;08:56;"first Green Day shirt from like 89 or whatever. I bet it's pretty tight. And"
08:56;09:00;"like someone had it in like their mom's attic in Berkeley for the last like 33"
09:00;09:05;"years and they're like it's in great shape throwing it up. Is that a five"
09:05;09:09;"figure shirt? I don't see that going for five figures. That sounds like something"
09:09;09:13;"you might come across on eBay that's like. I'm looking at eBay now. Early early"
09:13;09:20;"Green Day shirt. Gilman Street era. Yeah. I could see that going for like $850."
09:20;09:25;"Look can I get a number crunch? Yeah I'm on eBay now. What's the most expensive Green Day shirt?"
09:25;09:31;"The most expensive is someone looking at a 94 Dukie shirt and they are asking"
09:31;09:37;"$1,100. Whoa how long has it been on the market? How long have you been selling it for?"
09:37;09:45;"Oh it's it's located in Japan. I mean that makes sense. Hmm I guess. Seinfeld can you use your. No it's sold."
09:45;09:53;"Oh it's sold for $1,100? It's sold for yeah $1,162. Wow. Seinfeld see can you use"
09:53;09:59;"some of your contacts in Japan to find the the seller and see if we can get"
09:59;10:03;"them on the show and just say did they know they were gonna get that much money"
10:03;10:07;"for it? Where did they find the shirt? Maybe they can't tell us who bought it"
10:07;10:11;"but maybe they could give us a little bit of metadata about the buyer. Oh"
10:11;10:16;"totally. I'll tap my Tokyo Network and get the division on this. Okay great."
10:16;10:19;"Let you know if they surface."
10:26;10:42;"There's seven heroes that ain't trembling 'Cause now that's seen dead I am out here on my own And I'm feeling so alone"
10:42;11:02;"I've turned to the gray streets and the broken roads Some calling swamps, some calling nights I'm going to get through a place that I'd like to call my home Welcome to paradise"
11:02;11:24;"I'm seeing here that Nike and the Beatles collaborated on a shirt that sold for $50,000. When did Nike and the Beatles collaborate on a shirt? So there was a 1987 ad campaign for Nike. They used the Beatles song ""Revolution"". Apparently Beatles did not want that song used, but Michael Jackson owned the rights to it. Classic."
11:24;11:44;"And then they said Nike decided to pull the commercial as well as I guess they had officially licensed merchandise at the same time, which is a little weird, right? Because if the Beatles were like, don't use our song, wouldn't they have had to approve the shirt that has the Beatles as actual beetles, insect beetles, and it says it's a revolution on it."
11:44;12:04;"It sounds like a great shirt. Uh, wait a second. So there was like a beetle with like a John Lennon head. What do you mean? Yeah, it's a beetle. They're playing here. I'll text it to you guys, but the Nike itself is very subtle. It's just on Ringo's like a kick drum. Anyway, I guess this is a, this is a true grail here."
12:04;12:33;"And this went for $50,000. 50 K. Yeah. This is from a list called the most expensive vintage t-shirts sold at auction. And it's the highest like band shirt on the list. Is there anything higher period? Yeah. There's a shirt by a company called superlative luxury that apparently sold for $400,000. What? The shirt contains diamonds containing roughly nine carats of black and white diamonds. This is often considered the most expensive shirt in the world."
12:33;12:55;"The shirt is claimed to have been made from pure green energy as the process of making it utilized solar energy. It did not emit any CO2. Yeah. Mining diamonds is really known as a really low key, not particularly resource intensive, low carbon footprint. This sounds like some kind of probably like tax evasion scam."
12:55;13:24;"Also that Beatles shirt is terrible. It's very low key guys. I gotta say, I think the t-shirt market's getting out of control. Overheated t-shirt market. Over it's it's overheated. The Beatles t-shirts terrible 400 K for a diamond t-shirt. Also, I feel like this probably happened in the eighties already when people first started kind of like complaining about designer jeans and t-shirts."
13:24;13:48;"That probably happened in the seventies because that used to be like a, a kind of like line or a meme, something that would come up where people just be like, you gotta be kidding me. I used to go down in the store, get a, get a pair of Levi's for $8. I get a pack of three white Hanes t-shirts for two bucks. You're telling me people starting to spend $40 on a t-shirt. You gotta, you must be out of your mind."
13:48;13:58;"Like that's something that people used to say. And I'm sure you still get some people being like, you're telling me there's people out here spending 300 bucks on some kind of fancy t-shirt."
13:58;14:13;"Speaking of Hanes shirts. Yeah. On this, there's a Run DMC Adidas Hanes shirt. Yeah. That is going for $13,000. What is it from like 84, 85 that era?"
14:13;14:22;"Yeah, no, it's not a new shirt, but yeah, it's a vintage shirt, but it's a Hanes shirt. It's printed just on a regular white tee."
14:22;14:24;"Like it was homemade merch or?"
14:24;14:34;"No, no, no. I think that it's, you know, I think that that's just how Adidas at that. I don't, Adidas at this point is probably fabricating their own shirts, you know, but this is, they just had a Hanes shirt."
14:34;14:38;"So this is like kind of like a three-way collab actually for all the Hanes heads."
14:38;14:54;"The Hanes dealers. Whoa. That Hanes. There's a straight up Hanes UNICEF shirt. It's from the 96 Olympics. $42,000. 40. What? But this is just a."
14:54;14:57;"Is that asking price or is that a, is that auction result?"
14:57;15:01;"It's the, it's the auction result. Someone paid that much."
15:01;15:07;"42,000 for a 90s. What? I'm so confused."
15:07;15:12;"As we're talking, I'm scrolling through the Grateful Dead auction. It's like all the gear is like super overpriced."
15:12;15:19;"Somebody paid $16,000 for Bob Dylan's harmonica holder that he used on tour with the dead."
15:19;15:31;"Honestly, the best deal is somebody bought this, a Grateful Dead Madison Square Garden, 1988 denim jacket for $1,260."
15:31;15:32;"That's an honest price."
15:32;15:37;"Seinfeld, are you fine? Can you find a list of most expensive jean jackets ever sold?"
15:37;15:38;"At auction?"
15:38;15:41;"At auction. Yeah, it's gotta be at auction."
15:41;15:51;"I guess with all this dead stuff, it's not hard to imagine. There's a lot of wealthy deadheads. I wonder if Tucker Carlson, you know, got anything. He must have had his eye on this."
15:51;15:52;"Ann Coulter?"
15:52;15:54;"Ann Coulter. She probably grabbed a few things."
15:54;15:58;"Tucker and Ann Coulter texting. Are you looking at the Sotheby's auction?"
15:58;15:59;"Oh yeah."
15:59;16:08;"I've come across an article. The title of this article is, would you pay US $4.59 million for this infinity denim jacket?"
16:08;16:10;"What?"
16:10;16:22;"With diamond buttons and gold and platinum studs, the ultimate style collaboration between Karl Mathers of Lord Swagger and Stuart Hughes has a price tag to match."
16:22;16:38;"And this shirt, it's probably worth looking at. This jacket is probably worth looking at too because it's highly studded. It's really tricked out with lots of different gold accents and things. I feel like I could see Jake in this."
16:38;16:49;"This stuff just doesn't make sense to me. Look, of course, you're going to have your billionaires who are going to buy a $5,000 cardigan without thinking about it."
16:49;16:59;"There's probably even like some billionaires that roll into like Brunello Cucinelli, which is very beautiful. Cashmere, Vicuna, things like that."
16:59;17:09;"Rich person, they might roll in, buy a $15,000 winter coat, not thinking about it. You know, they start throwing in some sweaters, get their whole winter wardrobe."
17:09;17:17;"They're kind of like Logan Roy, cashmere baseball hat. Next thing you know, you know, easily they drop a $100,000 for that winter."
17:17;17:18;"Okay."
17:18;17:32;"However, when you start talking about one denim jacket that costs $4.6 million, I can't visualize the person who's buying that because one thing about the hyper rich, they don't like being taken advantage of."
17:32;17:41;"They like taking advantage of people. They, you know, they, they want a deal because whoever's making that jacket is being a little bit cheeky."
17:41;17:48;"Either it's kind of just like a way to get attention. It's like a Supreme brick. Just like, does this even exist? Who cares?"
17:48;17:51;"Now people are talking about who's the designer."
17:51;18:00;"Oh man. Uh, the designer's name is Carl Mathers. Uh, the brand is called Lord Swagger. And then he's collaborated with somebody else named Stuart Hughes."
18:00;18:02;"Lord Swagger."
18:02;18:05;"Is this the picture that you sent? This is the jacket?"
18:05;18:07;"Yeah, that's the jacket. Yeah."
18:07;18:17;"I could see they might make this up and be like, you know, like time crisis, we could start a store and say just like me and Jake, we started a new company called like Mr. Swagger."
18:17;18:22;"We're very proud to announce that we are selling the most expensive jean jacket in the world."
18:22;18:29;"It's a little bit nicer than the Lord Swagger jean jacket. Ours actually costs $20 million."
18:29;18:43;"It's just completely studded in diamonds. But then we just put up a mocked up picture and we say, you know, if anybody actually buys it, if we ever get the email one day, like, holy shit, we just got $20 million in our bank account."
18:43;18:47;"They bought it. All right, me and Jake can go diamond shopping. We're going to stitch this thing together."
18:47;18:53;"But in the meantime, it's just a way to get attention. And now we're talking about Lord Swagger because they got our attention."
18:53;18:59;"I'm sure a lot of TC heads probably checking out their website. They're probably going to do a little bit of business today, you know, at a lower scale."
18:59;19:06;"So anyway, I just don't believe this is real. I guess like most things it's real, but it's not it's not really real."
19:06;19:15;"It does remind me like when Victoria's Secret was a thing. Every year there would be a news article about like the most expensive diamond bra ever, ever made."
19:15;19:20;"And that would be. Oh yeah. And you couldn't buy it, obviously, but it would be like the thing that people would talk about this."
19:20;19:26;"This is what this feels like to me. Yeah. What did they do? They put a diamond bra together for like one show and they took a picture."
19:26;19:30;"Yeah, it's always I think it was always in the show or something like that. And it would be like this big news."
19:30;19:35;"Like it was the same news every single year. It would be like they did it again. This is what that feels like."
19:35;19:40;"Time Crisis announces plans for the most expensive guitar ever made."
19:40;19:51;"The guitar is made out of pure gold studded with 20 million dollars worth of diamonds signed by every living member of the Grateful Dead and Led Zeppelin."
19:51;19:53;"And we're ready to sell it."
19:53;20:02;"I was just a little young boy. Papa said, son, you'll never get far."
20:02;20:14;"I'll tell you the reason if you want to know. Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go."
20:14;20:25;"Well, baby, baby, what's a gold diamond ring? What's it more than most any old thing?"
20:25;20:37;"Well, when I get those jelly roll blues, why I'd go and get anything in this world for you."
20:37;20:47;"I get down to the jewelry store, packing a gun, says wrap it up, I think I'll take this one."
20:47;20:58;"A thousand dollars, please, this jewelry man said to pre-send. I'll pay this one off to you in Lent."
20:58;21:10;"Some of the results are out of control. Like somebody paid $52,000, almost $53,000 for a speaker cabinet that Jerry owned that was used with the dead circa 1985."
21:10;21:19;"I mean, $53,000 just for a speaker cabinet. I mean, like, so here's one. Jerry had a Mewtron phase pedal."
21:19;21:26;"And it's like a pretty classic pedal that Jerry would have used. I'm sure he had many. And this one went for $16,000."
21:26;21:31;"See, that seems low to me. I would much rather have the pedal than the cabinet."
21:31;21:36;"Yeah. I just can't imagine a musician actually buying this stuff."
21:36;21:46;"And so I think that if you're like just buying it and showing it off a cabinet, like just probably fits better in your house and showing off a pedal."
21:46;21:52;"It's more like sculptural, a big speaker. It's like it's an art, art object at that point."
21:52;22:00;"It is interesting to think like, will there ever be an artist where people care this much this long after their heyday?"
22:00;22:06;"Well, I mean, I've imagined there's been big like Stones or Beatles auctions. I don't know."
22:06;22:10;"We don't have to maybe open that can of worms, but because we've been on this for a while."
22:10;22:15;"I'm sure for like also their 60s contemporaries. Yeah. I'm just thinking like you threw out the Green Day."
22:15;22:22;"Oh, right. Like, I mean, I could see like any number of artists that people are obsessed with that have huge follow."
22:22;22:26;"You know, yeah. Like a Beyonce auction and like another 15, 20 years."
22:26;22:29;"I think Wu-Tang. Oh, sure. Yeah."
22:29;22:34;"No, no. I'm sure all these artists have stuff that would get people pretty excited."
22:34;22:42;"I guess the Grateful Dead, there's something about the cult around the live show that makes any gear that was on stage kind of exciting."
22:42;22:49;"It gets pretty funny when you talk about like, yeah, imagine you could buy like part of like the speaker from a Beyonce stadium tour."
22:49;22:55;"Like who gives a ****? I mean, right. I'm sure there's so many like if it was something from a video or something."
22:55;23:00;"I'm sure there's a lot of really exciting things about that Beyonce could put up for auction."
23:00;23:06;"But just like the Grateful Dead, there's this like funny thing where some pretty mundane items are going for a lot of money."
23:06;23:12;"Yeah, it's wild. Well, congratulations to everybody who won big at the Grateful Dead auction."
23:12;23:28;"And I guess truly the real congratulations are in order for, I believe it was like Steve Parish and maybe some other people who are kind of like associated with the organization who put some of the stuff up from their personal collection."
23:28;23:32;"And I get that. You're like kind of a longtime crew member for the dead."
23:32;23:37;"You have a bunch of stuff. You're in your 70s. Like, yeah, cash in a little bit."
23:37;23:41;"Give it to somebody who's going to be super psyched overpay for it."
23:41;23:48;"Could you imagine writing the group thread saying, guys, I did it. I got I won the auction. I got Pigpen shirt."
23:48;23:55;"I spent $23,000 on it. I don't think you can even share that information with it."
23:55;24:00;"No, it's embarrassing. It's not a flex. You have to be in a peer group that would see that as cool."
24:00;24:05;"Right. Which is not necessarily the average Grateful Dead fan."
24:05;24:15;"Jake, what if you went to Ezra's place and you walked in and you saw that T-shirt framed on the wall and you're like, oh, that's cool."
24:15;24:18;"Like, where did that come from? Oh, damn. It was you."
24:18;24:22;"It looked like Stan. Is that a Stan reference?"
24:22;24:24;"Yes. Ezra is a Stan."
24:24;24:29;"I heard about a dude who won big at the Grateful Dead auction. His name was Ezra too."
24:29;24:32;"Oh, it was you."
24:32;24:34;"Pseudonym, dude."
24:34;24:36;"Yeah."
24:36;24:41;"I'd be like, word. OK, cool."
24:41;24:50;"The last thing I'll say about this and with all these auctions in general is I'm just so curious about whether these things will maintain their value."
24:50;25:05;"Because obviously when you talk about like the art world and people go so nuts about auctions and you're always reading in the press like new record breaking sale for Basquiat or Picasso or, you know, the classics."
25:05;25:10;"And you know, the people who buy art are not doing it for love of the game."
25:10;25:33;"They might say they are, but the art world is so associated with wealth management at this point that when you hear about somebody, you know, buying some famous Van Gogh and it's like it's a record breaking, whoever it is, it's safe to say they're an incredibly rich person who in the back of their mind is thinking, I will sell this one day and I will make my money back and then some."
25:33;25:52;"Generally, but anyway, this is just a totally different universe than the art world. And I'm just very curious about are there things like this that have been incredibly hot for a moment, which eventually cooled off so considerably that the next time this thing was at auction, it couldn't even get like half what it went for 10 years."
25:52;25:54;"I mean, there must be examples."
25:54;26:11;"Well, I was going to say most art is that way. I mean, you named Basquiat and like Picasso or some of the most famous artists from the 20th century. But like you go to Sotheby's and there's they're auctioning off thousands of pieces of art from people you may have not have heard of or people that much smaller careers."
26:11;26:16;"And, you know, maybe that stuff sold at auction for a lot of money 20 years ago. And yeah."
26:16;26:23;"Imagine being the child of who bought this pig pen shirt and it's you're with the lawyer. It's you're going over the inheritance."
26:23;26:24;"Oh, my."
26:24;26:40;"And they tell you that you are getting this pig pen shirt that your father, uncle, whatever, spent twenty three thousand dollars on. You're like, wow, I'm going to go, you know, 20 years ago. I'm going to sell this. And you bring it to market and they're like four hundred dollars."
26:40;26:58;"Yeah, I have a feeling that the Grateful Dead ephemera will not retain its value. But I also have a feeling the vast majority of it. I have a feeling that the Grateful Dead stuff is being bought for true love of the game and passion, though, and not for parking your money in a Picasso."
26:58;27:17;"I totally believe that. But as Nick pointed out, that might be cold comfort to some of the children of these collectors. Because just imagine, let's say your dad's not a millionaire. He's not a billionaire. He's just a hardworking man who over the course of his whole life socked away about 80 grand in his bank account. Nothing crazy."
27:17;27:41;"But then he says, you know what? I want a piece of this and I'm going to buy pig pen t shirt. I've worked hard my whole life. I'm buying this for love of the game. But of course, one day this will pass on to you, dear boy. And of course, you can you'll be able to sell it. And you're just like, Dad, please buy some Taco Bell NFTs. This is not this is not a good idea."
27:41;28:04;"He's like, well, I'm not particularly passionate about Taco Bell or NFTs. You know, I'm a deadhead and this is a win win. It's like, no, it's not. It's not a win win. I'm also just like now I'm just looking at the Sotheby's website, just checking out like random auctions they have like a Dutch Baroque brass two tier 16 light chandelier, late 17th, early 18th century."
28:04;28:22;"What's the estimate on that? The estimate is five to eight thousand dollars, although judging by the Grateful Dead auction, the estimates mean nothing. A lot of them were just like shattered. Here's another one like a Spanish colonial silver two handled bowl, late 18th century."
28:22;28:43;"So this is just a silver bowl. You know, if you look at it with just kind of amateur eyes, you're not a pro. You'd say like, all right, it's kind of a fuddy duddy old silver bowl. I guess you could put some fruit in it. Maybe if you're having a real fancy dinner, you could bust it out. There's some nice engravings, but, you know, it looks like something you might see at grandma's house."
28:43;29:06;"Anyway, the current bid for this is four thousand dollars. I'm just curious, will there ever come a moment when the fabric of society has changed so much or the people with money have changed so much that truly nobody's going to give a shit about an 18th century Spanish silver bowl? And whoever spent ten thousand dollars on it in 2021, people be like, you could buy that for like twenty five hundred now."
29:06;29:26;"You know, like physical things, old European chairs and tables. And I know there's a market for it now. But do you think that that'll ever just like the bottom will drop out? Just like when Elon Musk's son is like 50, he's going to be like, when those people are ruling the world, will they give a shit?"
29:26;29:47;"That's like when you're young, you can't picture like being interested in that stuff. And the question is, like, as you age, does that start to appeal? My parents have a lot of like old furniture that they like got from like their parents, you know, or maybe some stuff they bought in New England. Like they have like some like old ass, like 200 year old like tables, you know?"
29:47;30:08;"And yeah, it is kind of like, is that something that appeals to me? Not really. I see what you're saying. But maybe there's always going to be a contingent of the population that sort of like thinks that fancy old stuff connotes some sort of like sophistication. And as like they age, it's like, yeah, I need to get like a nice rug and a weird candlestick holder."
30:08;30:26;"A candlestick holder. And maybe just like these trends come and go like right now, 18th century European furniture seems like pretty irrelevant. But who knows? Maybe there'll be like a weird trend in like 30, 40 years and people will be like, it'll mean something different."
31:26;31:55;"Alright, got a nice email. Somebody's looking for a wedding song. Hi Ezra and Jake, my name is Natalie. Nice to meet you via email. My fiance and I recently got engaged this summer and we're getting married next summer. My fiance is a huge, huge TC head. I enjoy it too, don't get me wrong, but he's the type to listen to new episode as soon as it drops. We're also both huge VW fans. I'm writing you guys today because Brett and I are actively working to pick a song for the big first dance at our wedding. And it is hard to find the song that would be the right fit."
31:55;32:17;"I was wondering if you all have any ideas or recommendations since we both love VW, been to multiple VW concerts together. I was thinking a VW song would be great special, but I'm trying to think of which one would work and not be too sad or weird. If you guys want to write a song for it, also inclined to see how that would turn out. LOL. That's sweet. Probably don't have time for that. Slow process. Would love to have your advice."
32:17;32:45;"First of all, shout out to Natalie and her fiance, Brett. Congratulations. Well, I mean, a first dance is supposed to be kind of like touching, right? Yeah. Leather and Lace was my wedding dance. Leather and Lace, Stevie Nicks featuring Don Henley. Yep. I love that Don was prominently featured in your first dance. Well, that's a great song. Jake, what was yours?"
32:45;33:00;"The Wonder of You by Elvis Presley. Oh yeah. It's a fun, short, festive, very late. It's like maybe the year before he died. Very fun song. Got a great James Burton guitar solo. Pick that day off."
33:00;33:24;"I kind of remember that story that you didn't put a ton of thought into it, but you just, you've always liked it. Hannah had never heard it. So she heard it for the first time during your first dance? Yep. You didn't clear it with her before? I was like, I have an idea for the first dance song. Wonder of You. She's like, okay. We were like running around trying to get stuff together. It was the least of your concerns. I'm trying to think of a good VW song."
33:24;33:41;"It's got to be like romantic. It's like the couple's dancing, slow dancing or, you know, medium tempo dancing. Just the two of them. So it's not like you're not going to do like A Punk or something. That's what you would use to get the crowd going. That's like the second song."
33:41;34:03;"Yeah. Well, I'm sorry to Natalie and Brett because I don't think we have one that's quite right. I mean, I could look at it from a few different angles. I would suggest A Punk is that is our most popular song. Just purely in terms of the metrics. I've got my own personal favorites, but I would say just, you know, if there's any song that other people might know."
34:03;34:32;"What about the one that's like kind of towards the end of Father of the Bride? They're like, we go together like, oh yeah, we belong together. I think that would be good. It has the right message. I think. Is it too fast? You think? It's a little pumped up. I mean, I feel like everybody rush to. No, that's sad. That's a sad song. It's too sad. Yeah. I think that's too sad. Step is kind of sad. I don't know. I don't, but it kind of maybe has the right energy."
34:32;34:37;"I think we belong together. The Vampire Weekend version, not the Mariah Carey version."
34:37;35:05;"Okay. Right. Our version. I mean, I'm going to say A Punk again. I have the metrics I can look through and I can tell you unequivocally it's our most popular song. It's been used the most in films, programs, commercials. It's on all the streaming services. It's our most streamed song. Can get people moving in concert. People get really hyped up to it. I'd say play that two or three times and you got yourself a wedding."
35:05;35:15;"You know, Ezra, it strikes me that there's an opportunity here for Vampire Weekend to write like an extremely hyper targeted on the nose wedding first dance song."
35:15;35:16;"That's a great call."
35:16;35:19;"Right. Call it wedding first dance."
35:19;35:20;"First dance."
35:20;35:27;"First dance. There you go. This is like some Ed Sheeran. I feel like he would do that. But anyway, hyper focused first dance."
35:27;35:47;"I'm sorry I don't have a good answer for you, Natalie. You should probably do like, I don't know, naive melody by the talking heads or something like that. But what you're really showing me with your email is you came to TC asking for help. But what actually you did is help me. You made me understand there's a gaping hole in our catalog."
35:47;36:04;"I'm sorry, but like when you talk about top tier artists, you talk about Beatles, Elvis, Justin Bieber, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran. If you asked any of them, what song should I dance to at my wedding? They're going to have two or three perfect songs."
36:04;36:18;"You know, they're going to have a song that's clearly about love. It's got the right energy. And honestly, it's embarrassing that we don't have anything that quite fits that bill. So, yeah, LP five, let's say third single first dance."
36:18;36:19;"Just a deep ballad."
36:19;36:39;"It'll basically just be a rewrite of that Ed Sheeran song, the Barefoot in the Grass song. Yeah, with like a slight throwback kind of vibe. Just like, it's our first dance. It's our first dance. Just very straightforward."
36:39;36:40;"I'm excited about this."
36:40;36:42;"All right. Got something to focus on now."
36:42;37:05;"We go together like sunset, black and white, day and night. We go together like left and right. Oh, we go together. We go together like give and take, pains and aches, real and fake. We go together. Don't be opaque. It's clear we go together."
37:05;37:32;"We belong together. We belong together. Baby, there's no use in being clever. Baby, it don't mean we stay together."
37:32;37:35;"Okay, now we're going to get on the phone with our guest."
37:35;37:55;"Kelif Asane is the legendary music journalist born in 1976 in Birmingham, England. Although I believe he primarily grew up in America, including Connecticut. So we're going to have something very interesting to talk about. He was a music writer for the New York Times. And since 2008, he's been a staff writer for the New Yorker."
37:55;38:14;"He wrote a very important essay in 2004 about music fandom that was called ""The Rap Against Rockism"" and introduced the wider public to a debate within music criticism that quickly became framed as rockism versus poptimism. I still hear people use these terms."
38:14;38:17;"Sure. He coined those terms?"
38:17;38:45;"In my notes, it doesn't say that he coined them, but he brought it to a wider audience via the New York Times. He was the deputy editor of Transition, a journal of race and culture, based at the W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute at Harvard University. And he also played bass in the Harvard bands Hypertrophy, Sh*tstraw, Mopar, Fear of Reprisal, and Tactic, as well as the Devo Cover Band."
38:45;38:47;"Wait, those were all bands at Harvard?"
38:47;38:49;"Yeah, we're going to have to get into this with him."
38:49;38:51;"Harvard hardcore."
38:51;38:53;"And the new book is called Major Labels."
38:53;39:04;"Kelifa, also known as K, welcome to Time Crisis."
39:04;39:06;"Thank you. Happy to be here."
39:06;39:08;"We've got a lot of questions for you."
39:08;39:10;"Likewise."
39:10;39:18;"We were just kind of reading through your bio. It ended with a line about the various bands you played bass in at Harvard."
39:18;39:32;"For the record, I would never list my bands I played in in my own bio because no one ever cared about them. It feels like humblebraggy, like, ""Oh, I was in some bands."" No, they did not rise to the level of a band you could humblebrag about."
39:32;39:37;"But is it actually true that you were in seven different bands at Harvard and you played bass in all of them?"
39:37;39:45;"I generally, yeah, I think I probably played some guitar, too. But, you know, bands, it was like, you know, you and your friends did something."
39:45;39:52;"But I don't think I've ever been in a band where someone came to one of our shows to see us who didn't know us."
39:52;39:58;"So, like, I feel like that's a minimum level that you have to achieve to be like an actual band."
39:58;40:01;"Like, there has to be one person that wants to hear your music in the world."
40:01;40:05;"Right, at least one person. Yeah, because even if it's a full house, if you invited all of them."
40:05;40:08;"Right. It was never a full house. That's more like throwing a party."
40:08;40:14;"The only band I was in that I would say that anyone ever even enjoyed at all, I was in a Devo cover band."
40:14;40:18;"But yes, I never achieved actual bandom with any of my bands."
40:18;40:22;"What did Fear of Reprisal sound like? Is that a hardcore band?"
40:22;40:25;"Yeah, it was a brutal hardcore band. Quite unpleasant."
40:25;40:27;"And were these all hardcore bands?"
40:27;40:34;"No, I was kind of like, I feel like Mopar had a guy who had played in Antisene at one point in it."
40:34;40:39;"You know, Antisene, they were like a southern rock punk band, kind of."
40:39;40:42;"So maybe they had, they were a little more of like a punk rock band."
40:42;40:45;"And then some of the other ones were just kind of, you know, silly."
40:45;40:49;"I was much better at listening to music than making music. That was always true."
40:49;40:50;"Right."
40:50;40:51;"It remains true."
40:51;40:54;"Now we're getting more context. And given that your new book is about genre,"
40:54;41:02;"it seems like as a bassist and guitarist in your college years, you lean towards the punk hardcore spectrum."
41:02;41:04;"Oh, dude, that was my whole life."
41:04;41:09;"So like, literally my friend gave me a mixtape when I was 14, like a punk rock mixtape."
41:09;41:11;"And I was like, that's it. I'm going in."
41:11;41:18;"And like, put everything else aside and was strictly punk for years."
41:18;41:22;"Like in high school, I was like, I want to hear the weirdest music I can in the world."
41:22;41:25;"And I discovered Japanese noise music."
41:25;41:30;"And I just wanted to hear the craziest stuff ever in college because I went to Harvard,"
41:30;41:35;"which had WHRB, which had this incredibly uptight radio station."
41:35;41:40;"They had a punk rock department where you had to take an exam to be allowed like through the door."
41:40;41:47;"And then once you got through the door, you took a year, you took a semester long unofficial class on punk."
41:47;41:50;"And then at the end of that, you could be a radio DJ."
41:50;41:51;"Whoa."
41:51;41:54;"The idea that like you would be taught the punk orthodoxy,"
41:54;41:57;"like there's a lecture every week with a listening assignment."
41:57;42:00;"And then you'd go listen to these records and say what you thought about them."
42:00;42:05;"Like it was so perverse that it totally blew my mind."
42:05;42:07;"And I was like, wait, there's a punk orthodoxy?"
42:07;42:11;"I thought punk was supposed to be about breaking the rules, man."
42:11;42:18;"And, you know, of course, what I realized was that especially the genres that are the most about breaking the rules"
42:18;42:24;"or the most about defying whatever tend to be the ones that have the like strictest rules"
42:24;42:30;"and the strictest sense of themselves as a community and who's allowed in and who's kept outside."
42:30;42:33;"So that really changed the way I thought about music."
42:33;42:38;"I thought I was breaking all the rules because I was listening to all this quote unquote crazy punk rock."
42:38;42:41;"But then it was like, no, that hardcore band sounds like the Dead Kennedys"
42:41;42:44;"and the Dead Kennedys kind of sound like the Ramones"
42:44;42:50;"and the Ramones kind of sounded like the Stooges and the Stooges had been inspired by like the Seeds and the Sonics"
42:50;42:55;"and all this other stuff like, oh, there's a lineage like you're not out there like breaking all the rules."
42:55;42:58;"You're like exploring this one particular thing."
42:58;43:01;"And like there's some other stuff you could explore, too."
43:01;43:05;"Was there a year that they said that punk rock ended?"
43:05;43:11;"No, because it was still like so this was like early 90s and early to mid 90s."
43:11;43:16;"I graduated 98, but by that time I wasn't doing so much radio stuff."
43:16;43:20;"But it was part of the fun was that it was super plugged into what was going on."
43:20;43:26;"So at the same time, like we were doing shows in Boston, like the Boston hardcore scene,"
43:26;43:34;"as you guys might know, was so like affiliated with like kind of like a tough guy jock mentality that it actually split."
43:34;43:37;"And there was like a second hardcore scene that was the, you know,"
43:37;43:43;"the sensitive, straight edge, vegan kids in cardigans doing like Food Not Bombs benefits."
43:43;43:46;"Right. And so like it was totally plugged into that."
43:46;43:50;"And we were organizing shows. We were super into new music, too."
43:50;43:56;"I wonder if like it's funny because I'm having some memories of when I was in college,"
43:56;44:01;"which was in the early 2000s at Columbia, New York."
44:01;44:07;"And there was also this kind of like crew of people around the radio station WBAR,"
44:07;44:11;"which is the Barnard radio station, who are like these very smart,"
44:11;44:17;"but like in super like hardcore, like punk rock Ivy League dudes."
44:17;44:20;"And somehow it's like it kind of went together in a way."
44:20;44:27;"I mean, that Columbia and I'm sure also at Harvard, it's like it's very easy to avoid like the real like fuddy-duddy,"
44:27;44:30;"old school Ivy League stuff, you know, if you want to."
44:30;44:33;"But that character made a big impression on me,"
44:33;44:38;"just like the kind of person who would go on to get a PhD in philosophy."
44:38;44:43;"You know, like they would probably they know all about like Heidegger."
44:43;44:46;"Yeah. They know like German philosophy inside and out."
44:46;44:50;"And then they also collect like punk seven inches of stuff you never heard of."
44:50;44:52;"There's a nerdiness to it, right?"
44:52;44:56;"But then they would dress in like that borderline crust punk fashion."
44:56;44:57;"Oh, really?"
44:57;45:00;"But then also be like very... No, no, no, not that crazy."
45:00;45:02;"I'm just, no, maybe crust punk isn't right."
45:02;45:08;"But, you know, just like kind of like black jeans, jacket with the patches kind of look."
45:08;45:11;"And then, you know, but also be like very diligent students."
45:11;45:13;"I wonder if this character still exists."
45:13;45:16;"Have they been driven, driven off the earth?"
45:16;45:19;"When your research on punk, like what's what happened?"
45:19;45:24;"Well, like it sounds so old fashioned now, but what I realized looking back on it was like,"
45:24;45:29;"it was really old fashioned when I got into it in 1990, which was a long time ago."
45:29;45:34;"Right. Like that's the weird thing is I'm listening to the Sex Pistols in my bedroom in Connecticut."
45:34;45:38;"And like it's an old English band from like more than a decade ago."
45:38;45:44;"And it didn't strike me as strange that I was listening to this old music and found it exciting as a kid."
45:44;45:52;"And so, you know, one of the weird things about punk is that it seems so obviously like a fad when it happens in the 70s."
45:52;45:54;"You know, there's this cool stuff happening in New York."
45:54;46:00;"You have Malcolm McLaren in the UK basically creating, you know, it's kind of a media stunt."
46:00;46:09;"Right. He's got this got this shop sex and then he like puts this band together and they're going to be the Sex Pistols like named after the shop."
46:09;46:11;"The way teams are named after their hometowns."
46:11;46:13;"It kind of blows up."
46:13;46:20;"And there are news reports, I think, as early as 78 being like, well, the punk fad, you know, it came and went and the next thing is happening."
46:20;46:26;"And one of the strange things about punk is that it gets reborn like every few years in totally different ways."
46:26;46:30;"And this thing that you think would just sort of go away keeps coming back."
46:30;46:41;"You see that this year, right, with MGK and Olivia Rodrigo and like some of the biggest pop acts of 2021 are in some sense, depending on how we define it, like kind of punk."
46:41;46:44;"And, you know, it keeps happening in the underground, too."
46:44;46:47;"I think there's a that's the musical story of punk."
46:47;46:51;"There's a non-musical story, which is punk as a relative term."
46:51;46:59;"In other words, a song is punk compared to something else because it's it's crazier or it's louder or it's faster or it's meaner."
46:59;47:02;"Right. Like it's it's not the mainstream. It's something else."
47:02;47:10;"So there's another definition of punk, which is like it's a rejection of some version of the mainstream in favor of some version of the underground."
47:10;47:15;"And that was super inspiring to me as a kid because it was like critical thinking."
47:15;47:22;"It was like, oh, you can reject music like you can hate music like you don't have to just like listen to whatever else is listening to."
47:22;47:25;"You can have your own ideas. And that is a thing."
47:25;47:34;"I think that's been really inspiring to people over the decades and inspiring to people who don't know or even care about punk."
47:34;47:42;"Right. This idea of punk, this idea of hardcore. Right. And core becomes this suffix that gets like, you know, it's like mumble core norm core."
47:42;47:48;"Like it's this thing that has this meaning that people relate to, even if they don't care about actual hardcore punk music."
47:48;47:54;"So there is this this ideal of punkness that I think people imbibe like you see it in all the alts, right."
47:54;48:03;"Alt hip hop, alt country is like, oh, we'll do a sort of like punk ish version of this thing where it's going to be more it's going to have more integrity."
48:03;48:08;"It's going to be more underground. And you're kind of angry and sticking it to the mainstream version."
48:08;48:23;"Yes. Yeah. That's very interesting to think of, because that's the way that regardless of punk, like you said, the music perhaps only being used as like a brush stroke on on a pop star's painting today in some ways."
48:23;48:28;"But the idea of it being a relative term. Yeah. Because that makes it eternal. Right."
48:28;48:33;"It's like up or down, you know, then it becomes part of like the harmony of nature. Right."
48:33;48:45;"Or maybe it's a process even. Right. Like you can take country and you can like kind of like punkify it, like punk as a verb in the Ashton Kutcher sense of like you can punk things."
48:45;48:50;"Right. I've noticed that. I don't know how widespread it is, but there's like some people I used to work with."
48:50;49:07;"They're like a little bit older than me working in the music industry. And they would occasionally because maybe they actually did have some roots in punk, but they would often use punk rock as a verb, usually meaning to just avoid going through all like the official hassle of doing it."
49:07;49:18;"Like for doing a show, for instance, if somebody could say like, OK, what now people like to do stuff where you pop up somewhere unexpected and you could say, all right, well, if you want, let's say you want to do a show."
49:18;49:30;"I mean, we did this once in Washington Square Park a couple of years ago where, you know, if you want to do like an official show in Washington Square Park and you want to get a stage, you'd probably have to like hire cops and like talk to the city, whatever."
49:30;49:43;"And next thing you know, it would probably legitimately cost $80,000 to do some kind of like fun free thing. Whereas, you know, it's a public space. If you just want to show up with an acoustic guitar, you're allowed to do that."
49:43;49:58;"But anyway, that's like, well, let's just punk rock it. Let's just roll up, not ask anybody. And weirdly, that phrase has always stuck with me. Yeah, let's just punk rock it. I mean, be really lame, but even like, you know, don't make a reservation at a restaurant. Just punk rock it."
49:58;50:09;"The funny thing is, in an earlier generation, you might have used rock and roll that way, right? Like rock and roll might be the thing that stands in for like, let's just get the kids together and let's just do it. Let's not go through the official channels."
50:09;50:21;"And so part of the thing about punk rock is that it has this like reformational urge, like something's gone wrong with rock and roll. This is one version of punk rock. And we're going to like put it back on the right course."
50:21;50:39;"One of the first major albums to use the word punk is the Nuggets compilation that Lenny K put out in the early 70s. And this is like a compilation of like late 60s rock and roll bands. And the idea is like, well, rock and roll have this spirit for a moment. And these bands were punk. And that spirit is gone. And we're going to find that again."
50:39;50:52;"So yes, part of the irony of that is the thing that you described isn't just limited to punk. That used to be and sometimes still is the way rock and roll thinks of itself. And one way to be punk is to be more rock and roll than rock and roll."
51:28;51:31;"So I see you were born in 1976 and you grew up in Connecticut."
51:31;51:32;"Yeah."
51:32;51:51;"Jake was born in 1977. He grew up in Connecticut. And we often talk on this show about Connecticut in particular. Jake kind of rags on it. He doesn't exactly have a lot of home state pride, partially because in Jake's words, as far as the tri-state area goes, Connecticut is not pulling its weight."
51:51;52:07;"I mean, part of the problem with Connecticut for music or one of the things that's tricky is it doesn't really have any cities. That's kind of an issue. Although like Long Island doesn't either. And it's smaller than Connecticut with a smaller black population and has given us a lot of great music of a lot of genres. Yeah, Connecticut."
52:07;52:13;"Yeah, quite a bit. But there is something apparently very important called Connecticut hardcore."
52:13;52:34;"Connecticut hardcore. In fact, you could say that New York hardcore is in a sense Connecticut hardcore because the New York hardcore scene was a little bit more of one by the late 80s. And this band from Connecticut called Youth of Today comes down and like kind of revivifies the New York hardcore scene and like has this label Revelation Records, which is super important."
52:34;52:49;"And the funniest part of that is that it kind of like suburbanizes the New York hardcore scene because you have this new crew, you know, sometimes they call the youth crew and they're wearing like varsity jackets and sneakers like that's going to be the new uniform of New York hardcore."
52:49;53:10;"Thanks to these Connecticut kids and like for some of the New York people, it was kind of exotic, right? And intimidating, right? Because they're used to boots and jeans and t-shirts and like this crew of like sort of suburban jock looking guys, you know, kind of muscular short hair. Like that's the new exotic thing in New York is this Connecticut wave."
53:10;53:12;"What year was that about?"
53:12;53:14;"It's like the late 80s."
53:14;53:19;"Interesting. I don't know that history. And did those kids move to New York City or did they stay in Connecticut?"
53:19;53:46;"Yeah, like I think, you know, Ray Capo and the other like Youth of Today people, you know, they were in at various points. I think Revelation in the early years was in New Haven. It was in Danbury. And then at some point, yes, they go down to New York and become, you know, help build this like New York straight edge hardcore scene. And then of course, Ray converts or gets increasingly interested in Hare Krishna and like that's the birth of Krishna Corps."
53:46;53:57;"Okay, so Youth of Today is they were kind of like the ultimate Connecticut hardcore brand. They ushered this in and they were vegetarian and straight edge. And I guess Moby was part of Connecticut hardcore too?"
53:57;54:12;"Yeah, Moby was in the Vatican Commandos. They weren't popular at the time, but obviously he becomes like an important figure. If we're talking Connecticut, I would claim Richard Carpenter, although he's not hardcore. The Carpenters lived in New Haven in the early part of their life."
54:12;54:14;"I would claim Michael Bolton."
54:14;54:17;"I would claim John Mayer."
54:17;54:19;"Dave Longstreth."
54:19;54:21;"Dirty Projectors, my brother."
54:21;54:37;"Dirty Projectors. But all of these are these kind of individuals who did lay their head at some point in the great state of Connecticut. What's interesting about Connecticut hardcore is that it actually is like a genre that kind of like means something that comes from Connecticut."
54:37;54:45;"Yeah, you have this band Jasta 14, right? And the lead singer is Jamie Jasta, who goes on to be the lead singer of Hatebreed, this metalcore band."
54:45;54:46;"Major band."
54:46;55:04;"I think he was actually the host of Headbangers Ball for a minute. He's kind of like a personality in that world. So yeah, and when I was going to shows, I was like on the punk side of the punk hardcore divide. So I was a little bit that more kind of like tough guy jockish stuff. Took me a few more years to kind of go back and appreciate that."
55:04;55:14;"So is it fair to say that punk and hardcore was like the first genre that like deeply meant something to you as a young adult?"
55:14;55:22;"Yeah, it was the first time I was obsessed with music was that was punk and hardcore. Did you have like a formative experience with punk?"
55:22;55:50;"Yeah, I also, I'd never been quite so interested in the history of a genre before. You know, like, of course, I listened to different types of music. Like I'm sure all of us, I was like, just into music. I was always kind of interested in all types of music. But there was something about being like 13 or 14, kind of getting into punk being like, oh, there's a band from New Jersey called the Bouncing Souls. I really like them. And they're, oh, they're from New Jersey. That's interesting."
55:50;56:19;"And then kind of look, you know, my dad was into like, early punk. So you know, I look at his old records and be like, oh, the Ramones. And this was a cool band. Like when my dad was like, not a dad yet. And he was listening to the Ramones and the Clash. And there's something about that, that I kind of put it together in a way that I didn't do with anything else. And then my friend had this book called Punk Diary that goes kind of like day by day through like, it's English focused, but it goes like day by day through like 1975 through 1978."
56:19;56:40;"It's like what single came out that day? You know, what band formed? What show happened? And there's something about that, that I found so fascinating. That yeah, I don't know what maybe because punk is like small, you can really wrap your head around it. And you can really see that lineage. So yeah, there's the I guess it's a, it's a way of seeing or something. When you get into punk."
56:40;56:51;"It's like nicely tribal too. You can feel like you're part of something. Even if you're not like exactly living that lifestyle, you can feel like there's like a like minded thing happening. There's like a community."
56:51;57:02;"Yeah, even if you just throw on the record and you hear them talking about, you hear like the band talking about what they believe in and what they think and whatever. And you look at the pictures. Yeah, you kind of feel immersed in it."
57:21;57:24;"But your book is not only about punk."
57:24;57:27;"No, it's about seven different genres."
57:27;57:47;"It's seven different genres of punk starting with Connecticut hardcore. That's right. That's right. It goes all the way to Long Island pop punk. Moving into the 2010s Willimantic scene, which is one of Connecticut's greatest contributions to the punk legacy. The world is a beautiful place and I'm no longer afraid to die is a Connecticut punk band that was important in the emo revival."
57:47;58:14;"Yeah. Oh, I know Jake. Do you know this band? No, I'm way out of the loop on the CTHC scene. You said that was 2010s? Yeah, 2010s. They're more on the like emo punk indie side. What city is in Connecticut where these bands based out of? I think world is a beautiful place are from Willimantic. Is that Eastern CT? It's like I think it's outside. Yeah. And I think it's kind of outside of Hartford. Interesting. Cool. I don't want to get fact checked here."
58:14;58:17;"But yeah, no. Wow."
58:17;58:28;"So the book is actually about seven different genres of music. Punk merely being one. It's got rock, R&B, country. So now in your own words, what made you want to write a book about genre?"
58:28;58:50;"It was kind of two reasons. One was that I wanted to tell the story of what I felt like had happened to music since basically since the Beatles broke up, like how everything got so fragmented and weird and obscure and no one's ever heard of anything. And like your average person is like, I know there's house and there's techno, like, not really sure the difference between them and like, why do these things even exist?"
58:50;59:16;"And so I felt like the story of what happened to music, you know, in the last 50 years from the 70s onward was partly the story of these genres developing and having arguments within themselves and fragmenting and going to strange places. And that if you want to understand why music is the way it is, like learning about genres is kind of a good way to do it. Learning about why country music went this way and R&B went this way."
59:16;59:42;"The other reason I wanted to write about genres is because I feel like there may be underrated. Maybe there's a tendency to think of genres as like, oh, it's kind of closed minded and these people, they have these gatekeepers and they're telling musicians what to do. And there's these closed minded, narrow minded listeners that only listen to this. And that if we're enlightened listeners, we should listen to everything. And if you're like a, an imaginative musician, you should transcend genre, right?"
59:42;01:00:10;"Like critics like me are always praising musicians for like, oh, they combine genre, they transcend genre. They're not limited by genre. And so I kind of wanted to stick up for the idea of a genre because the genre is kind of a musical community, right? It's a community of listeners and musicians, often an imaginary community. And like, yeah, communities can be closed minded and, you know, they can be elitist and all these other things that make us kind of itchy."
01:00:10;01:00:27;"But that said, like as humans, we like communities. We like being part of communities and that's why we keep building them. And that's why usually when we're knocking down the barriers to genre and like expanding our community over here, usually we're building new barriers over there to keep people out in a different way."
01:00:27;01:00:45;"Because every community, every genre has that dynamic of inclusion and exclusion, right? So you can have like the punk rock scene or the hardcore scene I was part of where it's like, where there's strong rules about like everyone's straight edge, people have similar political views, you're not allowed to mess with major labels."
01:00:45;01:01:07;"Or you can have something like R&B, which is like, it's, you know, it's this tradition of great black music and black singers performing for, you know, largely black audiences. And in one way, like R&B is really welcoming, right? There aren't really gatekeepers, especially within the black community of musicians. There aren't really gatekeepers saying like, you're not an R&B singer, you are an R&B singer."
01:01:07;01:01:30;"But what they have instead are charts and R&B singers tend to be obsessed with charts. Aretha Franklin was obsessed with the charts throughout her life. Like she was always wondering like, who's number one on the R&B charts? Why isn't it me? Right? Because if you don't have a firm boundary around your genre, if you can't just say like, oh, we're a community defined this way, you have to find a different way to figure out like what your community is."
01:01:30;01:01:43;"And so often pop charts are one way that communities can kind of define themselves. But there's always some way that any musical community has of figuring out like, well, who are we and who's in and who's out? And like, what does this mean?"
01:01:43;01:02:03;"Yeah, it is funny to think about like the pop community, because historically, to be a pop artist would mean to be on the pop charts."
01:02:03;01:02:25;"Right. But probably very wealthy."
01:02:25;01:02:54;"Right. And so we're going to put forward this idea that like, actually pop is cooler than rock."
01:02:54;01:03:13;"And actually pop has an identity. So in the 80s, you get the birth of a kind of self-conscious pop. And the funny thing is, even now, when you listen to like so-called hyper pop acts, if you listen to like Kim Petras or someone that's making music that might be considered hyper pop, a lot of what they're drawn from is that 80s sound."
01:03:13;01:03:20;"So the 80s is where pop becomes goes from being just a catch all category to like a specific sound as well."
01:03:20;01:03:24;"And that you kind of feel like that's still the era that we're in today."
01:03:24;01:03:39;"Yeah, it's one thing that people mean when they say that like Katy Perry is like a real pop artist. They mean like she sort of draws from Madonna, right? Or like Lady Gaga is drawn from like a lot of 80s stuff. And so that's one way to be pop is to be part of that particular tradition."
01:03:39;01:04:02;"Another way to be pop is just to like have your records sell like crazy. And, you know, defined broadly, pop includes everything in the book. But, you know, there is a sense when like Dr. Dre puts out the chronic, it's like the album is like a huge blockbuster, but like, it's not exactly pop in its sensibility, right? It still feels a little bit subcultural, even though it's more popular than everything else."
01:04:02;01:04:30;"One, two, three, and to the folks Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door. Ready to make an entrance. So back on up. Cause you know we're about to rip this. Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble. Compton and Long Beach together. Now you know you in trouble. Ain't nothing but a G-Thang, baby. Too low depth, so get going crazy. Death Row is the label that pays me. Unfadeable, so please don't try to fake this. But uh, back to the nature at hand."
01:04:30;01:04:54;"Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand. From a young G's perspective. And before me better get hushed if I have to find a contraceptive. You never know she could be earning her man and learning her man. And at the same time burning her man. Now you know I ain't with that shit. Ain't no geese who good enough to get burned while I'm a-bending. And that's relevant, real deal, holy field. And now you know how I feel."
01:04:54;01:05:09;"One lip is good enough to get broke off a proper chunk. I take a small piece of some of that funky stuff. It's like this and like that and like this, Santa. It's like that and like this and like that, Anna. It's like this and like that and like this, Santa. Drake creep to the mic like a fan."
01:05:09;01:05:20;"We gotta ask you about your famous 2004 article where you talk about rockism and poptimism. Is this something that you just get asked about constantly like when you do press? Is this like-"
01:05:20;01:05:25;"You've illustrated a difference between us, Ezra, with that phrase ""when you do press."""
01:05:25;01:05:26;"Yeah."
01:05:26;01:05:33;"Because traditionally, I'm a writer and traditionally no one asks me any questions except for now that I've written a book. But yes, the idea-"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"Now you're on the circuit."
01:05:34;01:06:03;"That's right, man. Give me some advice. No, the idea that like you write something- it's always been a little surreal to me that you like email something into the New York Times. I was at the Times at the time in the 2000s and they would like print a million newspapers and send them around the country. Like, you kind of know that's happening, but you don't really know. You don't really know what people's reactions are. So yes, the idea that like anyone would read it and want to talk to me about it, let alone argue over that article for years. That's like the best case scenario for someone like me."
01:06:03;01:06:16;"Well, totally. I mean, and how many- you know, I have a lot of respect for music writing and music criticism, but how many early 2000s music essays are referenced in 2021?"
01:06:16;01:06:24;"Yeah, I certainly wasn't expecting that. And it was, you know, it was a continuation. This term ""rockism"" was invented, as far as I can tell, in the early 80s in the UK."
01:06:24;01:06:31;"Yeah, so we wanted to clarify about that because we were talking about it before you came on. So you didn't create the words ""rockism"" or ""poptimism""?"
01:06:31;01:06:46;"No, in fact, I didn't even use the term ""poptimism"" in the essay. I'm not sure it existed yet. That came along later. And ""rockism,"" I certainly didn't coin it. But it was like this debate that had been happening and it happened in the UK in the 80s and like all the music critics kind of knew about it."
01:06:46;01:07:02;"But I felt like your average normie American listener had no idea that this was happening. So I kind of wrote this essay about rockism partly to express some of my own grudges, but also as a way of saying like, ""Hey, this is a thing that's happening. This is a debate that's going on."""
01:07:02;01:07:22;"And this kind of gets to some of the fundamental questions of how we value music. Rockism means taking the values of rock and roll and elevating them among all others. Imagining that rock and roll is the coolest kind of music and any other kind of music, if it's good, it'll be a little bit like rock and roll in some way."
01:07:22;01:07:34;"It'll be kind of rebellious. It'll be kind of scruffy. It'll be kind of raw. It'll be kind of noisy. And you used to see this. You see rappers get praised like, ""Oh, they're finally not doing that bling bling stuff. They're going to really get into some real stuff."""
01:07:34;01:07:42;"Or like, ""This record's cool because the production is really this."" Or like, ""They're not just one of those groups you see in videos. The live show is really great."""
01:07:42;01:07:55;"And so the idea of challenging rockism is the idea of saying like, ""Hey, wait a second. Why is rough better than smooth? Why is a concert better than a video? Why is making great albums better than making great singles?"""
01:07:55;01:08:09;"And those actually turn out to be sort of hard questions to answer because it's impossible to have no preconceptions about music. We all have ideas about what we think we like. And the trick is to just be aware of what those ideas are and maybe think about where they come from."
01:08:09;01:08:32;"Well, and it's interesting because today I feel like sometimes you see critics who... I mean, I've seen people say this. They almost feel like personally wounded. Like there was some overcorrection after people started to talk about rockism that there became such a high dose of poptimism that actually rock was just so dead as a doornail."
01:08:32;01:08:54;"And so I've seen this narrative out there. I don't know if that's entirely true, but it's interesting that anybody even feels that way. And I guess one question I have for you as somebody who in 2004 was writing about this, in terms of this rockism versus maybe you didn't use the word poptimism, but anti-rockism, what do you think happened over the next 17 years?"
01:08:54;01:09:17;"Well, it's funny when I read the piece now, part of the thrust of the piece, part of the vibe of the piece is like, ""Hey guys, Wilco is cool, fine, but how come we don't take Destiny's Child seriously?"" And that war obviously has been won. Beyonce is probably the most admired musician on the planet maybe? And Beyonce is not interested in rock and roll at all as far as we can tell."
01:09:17;01:09:20;"She's doing bigger numbers than Wilco. I can tell you that."
01:09:21;01:09:27;"Well, they often did bigger numbers, but this was partly about respect, right? And the idea of who gets treated as a serious musician."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"No, no, she's doing bigger respect numbers."
01:09:29;01:09:46;"Yeah, she's doing huge respect numbers. And in fact, ironically, here's the ironic thing about Beyonce, she's maybe doing bigger respect numbers than streaming numbers, right? She's not necessarily making monster hits these days, but she's ascended into royalty."
01:09:46;01:10:03;"I guess this is just a purely intellectual question is when you're talking about the way in which music critics or a type of snobby music listener had these rock ideas, even if they weren't talking about genre, they still had these rock ideas that came from 20th century rock fan paradigms."
01:10:03;01:10:04;"Right."
01:10:04;01:10:22;"Does Beyonce's success shatter that? Or actually did the paradigms of 20th century rock music thinking actually win and Beyonce still had to go make her quote unquote, like serious, critically acclaimed albums to, you know what I mean?"
01:10:22;01:10:44;"Well, I mean, if you define it that way, it's a little bit circular, right? You can't prevent critics from acclaiming critically acclaimed music. But I think that if you define rockism as like the values of rock and roll, then part of what I wanted to do in this book was talk about how like every genre has its own ism, right? There's R&B ism. There's country ism. Definitely country ism, right? There's hip hop ism."
01:10:44;01:11:00;"So in that sense, yes, maybe it's just a shift. But at the same time, you mentioned snobbery and the idea of musical snobbery. And that is something you definitely can't get rid of because snobbery is really hard to define in music as elsewhere, right?"
01:11:00;01:11:18;"Like to be a snob means to like something and not like something else, or maybe to not like something else because you don't like the people that that something else is associated with. And like, that's just describes the process of loving music. Like we all do that all the time. I'm not sure there's any way to love music without being a snob in some sense."
01:11:18;01:11:38;"And if anything, I think professional music listeners tend to be less snobby than like regular people who like if you go up to them a regular person and ask what they think about Justin Bieber or something, you're liable to get, you know, like 90 seconds of straight abuse and of the kind that you would ever hear on NPR or read in the New York Times."
01:11:38;01:11:57;"So I think there's no way to escape snobbery. I think one of the things about music is that no matter how much of it you consume, there's always stuff that you're devaluing or ignoring. There's always something that's like outside of your vision. And so yeah, when we're elevating Beyonce, there's something else that we're not paying close attention to, right?"
01:11:57;01:12:12;"Like a lot of the people, a lot of the listeners who were the most fired up about like, we don't want to be raucous. We want to be poptimist. And sometimes that was political, right? Sometimes that was we want to make sure we're celebrating the music of women and people of color, queer artists, etc."
01:12:12;01:12:30;"Like sometimes some of those people were the people who were the most bummed out about the EDM boom of the 2010s, like the most mad at Avicii and Alesso and Tiësto and Skrillex and all these people that are filling up arenas with kids wearing, you know, dayglo fishnets or whatever."
01:12:30;01:12:46;"And so like, there's always something that people hate and there's always something that is kind of not getting that sort of acclaim. And in that essay I wrote in 2004, I said something like, you know, there's lots of new music out there. We need some new prejudices."
01:12:46;01:13:01;"And like, that's kind of what I meant in terms of not that like there's somehow a way to, as George Michael would say, listen without prejudice. I'm not sure that's possible. But the idea is just to think about what your prejudices are and whether they're kind of like suitable to the moment."
01:13:01;01:13:16;"And one thing that I hope and one thing that I enjoy is that sometimes you can get a bit of a voyeuristic thrill of listening to music and just thinking about like, who loves this? Like, why do they love it? What would it feel like to love this? If you love this, what would be the thing about it that you loved?"
01:13:16;01:13:34;"And so hopefully that's part of the fun of thinking through these different genres, these different communities is like, you don't have to end up loving, you know, 80s country or death metal or slow jams or whatever. But like, maybe it's kind of fun to think about those communities and where that comes from and what itch that stuff is scratching."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"Right."
01:13:35;01:13:48;"To the left, to the left."
01:13:48;01:14:03;"Everything you own in the box to the left, in the closet. That's my stuff. Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch. Don't touch. Keep talking and that's that sign. Could you walk on top at the same time? And it's my name."
01:14:03;01:14:28;"If I'm not back, let me call you up. Standing in the front yard. Telling me how I'm such a fool. I'll never, ever find a man like you. You got me to stay. You must not know about me. You must not know about me. I can have another baby in a minute. Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute."
01:14:28;01:14:43;"You must not know about me. You must not know about me. I can have another baby in a minute."
01:14:43;01:15:03;"Well, on this show, we do talk about rock a lot. And that was the opening chapter of your book is about rock. And it's very interesting. One thing that I noticed reading that chapter was like, it's funny to think how many times rock was declared dead slash played out. Basically, starting with like the late 60s, 1970."
01:15:03;01:15:17;"The way you frame that was very interesting. So the Beatles are over. Everybody starts asking, who are the new Beatles? Well, there's a band we don't talk about that much today. But one band in the running in terms of their popularity was Grand Funk Railroad."
01:15:17;01:15:45;"Yes. Critics couldn't stand. So you basically you're talking about this moment where in the 60s, the biggest rock music tended to also be critically acclaimed and considered important by like the intelligentsia. Everybody was listening to the Beatles. And then suddenly you get into the 70s and people were like, wait, the big bands are like Black Sabbath and Grand Funk Railroad. Like what's going on? And there were critics who were like, well, rock's out of gas. That was fun, like 15 years or whatever."
01:15:45;01:15:57;"Even some of the bands, right? Like it's 71 and Led Zeppelin's like, it's been a long time since I rock and rolled. And you're like, oh, this is like a nostalgic rock song about the bygone golden era of rock and roll."
01:15:57;01:16:05;"Yeah, it seemed like in the early 70s. And you had some other quotes from like kind of major rockers kind of just being like, essentially being like, yeah, this is kind of over."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Crocodile Rock, Elton John. Yeah."
01:16:07;01:16:20;"So in some, because we talk a lot about this show. Jake once had a co-worker who told him, a guy who would seemingly be, you know, like a middle-aged dude who probably listened to a lot of rock music in his life and they were talking music."
01:16:20;01:16:31;"And this guy took a bite out of his burrito and said to Jake, rock's played out, dog. By the time that like you're getting like random, like 40 something white dudes saying rock's played out."
01:16:31;01:16:41;"It seems like now it's really out of gas, but then it's interesting to think, well, is it's been ending ever since 1970, something peaked then and we're, we're kind of still there."
01:16:41;01:16:53;"So rock is one of the older, the fact that you started with rock kind of made me wonder, like, I feel like a lot of people that I know, if you told them all the genres that you were writing about in the book, they would say that rock is the most played out."
01:16:53;01:17:03;"It's the most dead. Whereas R&B and rap still very vibrant, things are happening. Country has this slight permanence that the idea of it being dead doesn't even make sense."
01:17:03;01:17:06;"Permanently controversial, which helps."
01:17:06;01:17:24;"So it's interesting to me that you've done this kind of deep study of the genre of rock in the first chapter of your book. You also in 2004 noted this kind of need for a new way of looking at things, which also coincided with kind of a cultural shift and how a lot of people were looking and talking about rock music."
01:17:24;01:17:42;"Now, having looked at all and also studied all these other genres, do you think rock's played out dog? Has it been dead since 1970? Like people are talking about the zombified idea of rock since the seventies and the eighties. Does that trip you out thinking about rock? It's just such a weird concept."
01:17:42;01:17:59;"I think the word you use that's helpful here is zombified. Like I think I think rock is definitely undead and that can mean a few different things. It's funny. You read some pieces about like Bruce Springsteen in the seventies and I think in one of the like rock and roll, one of the Rolling Stone illustrated guides to rock."
01:17:59;01:18:11;"They're like, he's okay, but he's like kind of a throwback. Like he's kind of old fashioned, but like what Bruce Springsteen realized in the seventies was that the future of rock and roll belonged to the nostalgic people."
01:18:11;01:18:24;"That rock and roll was going to be in one way or another kind of nostalgic more or less. You know, there's exceptions like some of the metal stuff, you know, valued novelty, but there is a stuckness about rock and roll, right?"
01:18:24;01:18:37;"Like a traditionalist of it. Like people are still arguing about like what should be in a country band, but like a rock band, that thing of having a drummer, bassist, a guitar, maybe a keyboardist and a singer hasn't really changed in 50 years."
01:18:37;01:18:48;"And even the bands haven't really changed. Like there are some people who are like rocks played out dog, but for the people that are still super into it, if you met someone that like, what do you listen to? And they're like, I'm really into rock and roll."
01:18:48;01:19:02;"They'd be like, you could probably guess like, yeah, I bet that person likes the Rolling Stones. Like I bet they like Led Zeppelin. In that way, rock and roll is the most traditional, which is funny because that's kind of an uncomfortable position for rock and roll to be in."
01:19:02;01:19:17;"And, you know, I think if you look at like the current charts, right, there's an argument that rock and roll lives on in country music, right? That's when you hear like songs with like big electric guitars and a lot of the instrumental lineup that you would associate with rock and roll."
01:19:17;01:19:26;"And a lot of the biggest rock bands of the day, like mainstream rock bands, whether it's like Glass Animals or Coldplay or Imagine Dragons, right?"
01:19:26;01:19:35;"These big like festival rock bands love to collaborate with pop singers and pop producers and kind of like are playing down their rock and roll identity, right?"
01:19:35;01:19:42;"Like Chris Martin, by some definitions, is like the biggest rock star on the planet, but he doesn't really lean into that rock identity."
01:19:42;01:19:53;"Right. It's almost like, yeah, you could say the biggest rock bands became pop, but it's almost like, of course, they wouldn't be the biggest if they weren't pop in some respect."
01:19:53;01:20:04;"The last time that like a purely rock band could be anything considered like having the cultural gravity of pop, you'd have to go back to the 70s, right?"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"I thought you were going to say Nirvana."
01:20:06;01:20:21;"I guess the difference between like Nirvana and the Beatles is that Nirvana, like when you were talking about, you know, same era as Nirvana, like Dr. Dre coming out, no matter how big that was, it still represented something non-pop in a way."
01:20:21;01:20:28;"Whereas I guess, you know, when you think about the Beatles and even the Rolling Stones, somehow they just occupied both at once."
01:20:28;01:20:37;"Well, and one of the ironies of Nirvana, of course, is that they become not only the biggest band on the planet, but kind of like set the sound of rock and roll for decades to come."
01:20:37;01:20:44;"But they think of themselves as kind of an anti-rock band, right? Their whole thing is like, we're not going to be like those other people on MTV."
01:20:44;01:20:49;"And they, speaking of leaning in, they really leaned into that anti-identity."
01:20:49;01:20:56;"And, you know, I say in the book, one way you know that someone's part of a genre or part of a tradition is that they complain about it."
01:20:56;01:21:07;"They say they hate it. They're like, so when you see a band like Nirvana and they're saying like, oh, we hate these, all these bands that do this or that, like, you can tell like, oh, they really relate in some way to this rock and roll tradition."
01:21:07;01:21:12;"And that's why they care enough about it to complain about it and want to change it somehow."
01:21:12;01:21:17;"Just the way you hear country singers being like, oh, the stuff in Nashville and the stuff on country radio."
01:21:17;01:21:24;"Like if you hear someone saying that, you know, that's a country singer because that's the only people that care enough to complain about the community."
01:21:24;01:21:28;"So in a sense, Nirvana is kind of like an anti-rock and roll band."
01:21:28;01:21:35;"And the irony is they create this thing, alternative rock, which becomes the mainstream, paradoxically, right?"
01:21:35;01:21:40;"Like alt rock and mainstream rock, even the charts end up sort of resembling each other."
01:21:40;01:21:47;"Yeah. I thought it was interesting how you said that the post Nirvana era has lasted basically forever."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"It's insane, right?"
01:21:48;01:21:54;"And I just, I feel like I always thought that like Nirvana was like kind of the last gasp."
01:21:54;01:22:01;"And if you think of like the 20th century as like the rock or like the post-war kind of 20th century as the rock century."
01:22:01;01:22:06;"And like I trip on this, which is basically like, and tell me what you think."
01:22:06;01:22:17;"Or if I'm just off on some weird tangent, but I feel like in the 20th century, each decade had like a distinct cultural zeitgeist, 50s, the 60s, 70s."
01:22:17;01:22:22;"And like Nirvana was like, I kind of think of it as like the 90s as like the last decade."
01:22:22;01:22:27;"And Nirvana sort of like epitomized the cultural zeitgeist of that decade."
01:22:27;01:22:30;"And since then, it's just kind of been a blur."
01:22:30;01:22:39;"Like for me, maybe just because I'm getting older, but I just feel like from 2000 to now, it's just like one just blur of a decade."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"I don't really have a sense of like, this was the 2010s."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"This was the team or like, this was the arts."
01:22:45;01:22:46;"This was the teams."
01:22:46;01:22:52;"And I feel like Nirvana being the last band in a way sort of like exemplifies that."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"Like we're still in this weird post Nirvana, like alt world."
01:22:56;01:23:05;"I would zoom in a little bit and say that like, I think it's easier to do that in the 60s where you have a lot of these things combining in the 50s and 60s."
01:23:05;01:23:14;"Right. There's a moment in the 50s where like Elvis is number one on the country and R&B and pop charts simultaneously, I think."
01:23:14;01:23:22;"Like, and there is this sense in the 60s, people were talking about like Rolling Stones and the Supremes as like, they're all part of this like rock and roll thing that's happening."
01:23:22;01:23:30;"But like, part of why I wrote this book is that because of these genres and because of this fragmentation, I think you start having multiple side guys."
01:23:30;01:23:33;"It's like you think of Nirvana as the sound of the 90s."
01:23:33;01:23:38;"To me, like when you say 90s, like maybe my first thought is like so-called gangster rap."
01:23:38;01:23:41;"Like that's kind of really the sound of the 90s."
01:23:41;01:23:47;"But if you talk to someone else, they'd be like, well, the 90s were the decade of like Garth Brooks and Shania Twain."
01:23:47;01:23:53;"And the end of the decade, like Dixie Chicks and all this like country pop stuff coming together. And that was really important."
01:23:53;01:23:57;"And so I think what I hear is like a multiplicity."
01:23:57;01:24:01;"I think if you take any of those genres, you can like tease out what's going on."
01:24:01;01:24:10;"Right. Like in the 2000s, the rise of like indie rock and like retro rock is a big thing for rock and roll in the 2000s, for instance."
01:24:10;01:24:20;"Or in hip hop in 2000s, it's all about geographical diversity. The rise of Atlanta as the new home of hip hop and the rise of regional scenes around the country."
01:24:20;01:24:24;"And those get popular. So I think there are stories you can tell."
01:24:24;01:24:35;"But again, you don't necessarily have that feeling, arguably, maybe until recently of like the whole country is listening to the same thing and you can call it a zeitgeist."
01:24:35;01:24:44;"I think one of the ironies is like, you know, I wrote this book about genres and one of the things I wrestle with is this idea that like this is the moment where maybe they seem like they're dissolving."
01:24:44;01:24:51;"Like this is the moment when it's like Lil Nas X and it's Post Malone and it's the Kid LAROI."
01:24:51;01:24:56;"And it's like all these people that are kind of making all sorts of music at the same time."
01:24:56;01:25:07;"And so, you know, one of the things that people say about this moment is like, oh, maybe there is a sound of now because music is kind of merging and congealing into one like sticky mass."
01:25:07;01:25:18;"And, you know, what I suggest in the book, I have no idea if it's true or not, but I put it in a book anyway, is that maybe what that is, is that's just setting the stage for the next backlash."
01:25:18;01:25:30;"And maybe just as in that moment in the late 70s where it felt like everything was going disco and like the Rolling Stones were disco and Rod Stewart was disco and the Bee Gees were disco and Dolly Parton was disco and Star Wars was disco."
01:25:30;01:25:33;"Like that creates this furious anti-disco backlash."
01:25:33;01:25:49;"Maybe that's what happens in the next 10 years is there's like a backlash against, you know, these sort of like half song, half rap, trap drums kind of tracks where people push each other away again and say like, no, I don't want to listen to the same thing that those people over there are listening to."
01:25:49;01:25:55;"I want to do something different because I think both of those are very human, maybe even very American impulses."
01:25:55;01:26:04;"Right. The impulse to like form a group and be like, yeah, we can all be together doing our thing. And the impulse to like push the group away and be like, I'm not like those people over there. I don't know what their problem is."
01:26:04;01:26:12;"Yeah, it will be interesting to see what happens because there is. Yeah, I think the streaming services have created a different ecosystem."
01:26:12;01:26:29;"And I think they're probably eventually, I mean, I often talk about when I reflect on my band's career and I think about the moment that we came out and that was this like funny moment in between Napster and the streaming services."
01:26:29;01:26:52;"Right. People are still kind of buying records, but there was more need for blogs and people sharing music directly and writing about music. Obviously, there wasn't, you know, playlist culture yet. It kind of looks like that will be seen as this like funny little window that was neither the 20th century model, nor was it the 21st century model."
01:26:52;01:27:06;"It was like kind of like a lost decade, which is not to say that there wasn't meaningful music made there, but just in terms of like the texture of the music industry will be like neither here nor there."
01:27:06;01:27:14;"To Anna drove slowly into the city, thoughts in river all filled with snow, she spied the ring on his outer finger."
01:27:14;01:27:31;"Oh, a thousand years in one piece, the sail was she took it from him, lily white hat, short long fish, she'd seen the thing in the young man's wings, don't get her in."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"I'm."
01:28:00;01:28:05;"I liked in the book how you had so many contemporaneous sources."
01:28:05;01:28:12;"I was really cool because people act like they didn't think what people were thinking, like, like, no one ever thought Prince was a sellout."
01:28:12;01:28:23;"And it's like, no, there's a big there was an argument over this over how like, oh, to like get on MTV, like a black man has to be light skinned and a little bit of feminine and playing an electric guitar."
01:28:23;01:28:29;"And that somehow like, you know, that somehow a quote unquote manly black man like MTV is afraid of that."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"And so instead you get Prince and Michael Jackson. Right."
01:28:31;01:28:39;"That was one conversation that was going on and this idea that like this desire for crossover success was ruining R&B. Right."
01:28:39;01:28:44;"And no one talks about Prince that way now. And so the arguments that we have are different."
01:28:44;01:28:59;"But the things that we want from music, right, the fact that we want it to be kind of authentic in some way that's hard for us to actually put into words or that we're we're skeptical of the lure of mainstream success, even as we kind of like want it for those people."
01:28:59;01:29:09;"And somehow we want the mainstream to be radical, which is probably a contradiction in terms like a lot of those things are still like coursing through the way we think about music."
01:29:09;01:29:20;"Even if like someone like Prince, who used to be in all sorts of ways, like one of the most controversial musicians in America, is now just like someone that everyone loves and and reps."
01:29:20;01:29:34;"And but I suspect that some of the people that would count themselves as Prince fans, like if they sat down and like listen to Dirty Mind front to back, they'd be like, holy crap, like partly because it's so good, but partly because like this is a really like insane record."
01:29:34;01:29:38;"Like this sounds maybe more new wave than I than people talk about Prince sounding right."
01:29:38;01:29:46;"Like Prince has kind of been absorbed into this idea of like black music, which is a term that's like super hard to define."
01:29:46;01:29:50;"But people sort of use it with the idea that some music could be more or less black."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"And I'm not exactly sure what that means."
01:29:52;01:30:02;"But certainly one of the things that made Prince stand out was the way that he was engaging very forthrightly with musical traditions like New Wave that were considered white."
01:30:02;01:30:08;"You know, something similar with George Clinton, right, who in some ways is like the epitome of like funky musical blackness."
01:30:08;01:30:15;"But like his whole thing is like he's also got like a sick guitar player and they're getting played on like underground FM rock stations."
01:30:15;01:30:20;"So all this stuff is more mixed up sometimes than we remember it in the stories."
01:30:20;01:30:24;"And also at a more profound level, there's this question about history."
01:30:24;01:30:30;"There is this idea that many of us still have, I think, that like people in the future are going to validate what we like."
01:30:30;01:30:36;"Right. Like if you like some record that no one else likes, there is this feeling like deep down, like this is going to get rediscovered."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"Like people are going to realize like this record is really good."
01:30:39;01:30:42;"And, you know, I understand that urge. I often feel that urge."
01:30:42;01:30:51;"But I'm skeptical of that, too, because I'm like, I don't know, man, people in the future won't necessarily understand 2021 better than we understand it right now."
01:30:51;01:31:02;"Like maybe this is the best knowledge that we'll ever have of this moment and the historians that go back and future listeners who are elevating one performer from this year and denigrating another."
01:31:02;01:31:06;"Maybe they're the ones who are missing out. Maybe there's nothing so great about posterity."
01:31:06;01:31:15;"That's a very interesting point. And it's crossed my mind in some ways over the years because, you know, just as an artist and I'm sure you think about this too, Jake, in your work."
01:31:15;01:31:26;"Like when you look around, especially these days, you can sometimes wonder when you want to say something, you want to do something, you can wonder, well, how is this going to interact with the current cultural moment?"
01:31:26;01:31:32;"And of course, you could say to yourself, well, if it doesn't now, yeah, maybe in the future it will."
01:31:32;01:31:41;"And yet basically what I'm saying is there's also a school of thought that saying like being ahead of your time sometimes just also means that you are behind your time."
01:31:41;01:31:48;"There's an old idea that being ahead of your time meant that you were visionary and the world was too small minded to understand what you were doing."
01:31:48;01:31:58;"And then one day, if you accept this idea that people are getting smarter and more generous all the time, which is very, you can poke a lot of holes in."
01:31:58;01:32:02;"But like you were saying, the idea that people will understand things better in the future."
01:32:02;01:32:13;"Okay, well, yeah, if you look at it that way, sure, maybe one day when the humanity is filled with all these enlightened beings, then they'll go back and be like, damn, you know who got slept on in 1992? It was this band."
01:32:13;01:32:16;"Kanye speaks a lot to this, right?"
01:32:16;01:32:22;"You know, where he has said, you know, how he makes music, not for now, but for later."
01:32:22;01:32:31;"And I do think that he has a point when he talks about not being seduced, but not he's a huge star, not being seduced by the current wave."
01:32:31;01:32:37;"Right. Because it'd be very easy to just make music that is currently popular."
01:32:37;01:32:40;"But ironically, he does make music that's currently popular."
01:32:40;01:32:46;"He's had albums that maybe took like a year or something for people to like kind of shift their impressions of."
01:32:46;01:32:49;"But like he's been incredibly popular throughout his career."
01:32:49;01:32:58;"And I'm certainly a fan. We could talk about Kanye all day, but I would just say to Kanye, you got to watch out for the other thing, man, because you've been extraordinarily popular."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"It's more the pendulum just swings."
01:33:00;01:33:04;"And also in the future, it's like, you know, people want new stories, too."
01:33:04;01:33:12;"There's going to be somebody who at least they're going to write the article, say, in 10 years, say, you know who in the 2000s was really interesting?"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"It was this artist that nobody gave a shit about."
01:33:14;01:33:21;"And you know what? If you throw that on right now, you're probably going to find it more interesting than listening to Gold Digger because you haven't heard it 300 times."
01:33:21;01:33:25;"And then you'll listen to it and be like, yeah, this was yeah, this is pretty fresh."
01:33:25;01:33:29;"And it'll be some weird mix of nostalgia and, you know, whatever framing."
01:33:29;01:33:33;"But music is communication, right? Like that's part of the whole idea. That's part of why we love it."
01:33:33;01:33:40;"And so, yeah, the question is like, is it necessarily better to communicate with listeners in the future than to communicate with listeners right now?"
01:33:40;01:33:45;"I don't know. Or it's not really about better or worse, but like that's the thing you can do, right?"
01:33:45;01:33:49;"Some people do make music that really resonates with listeners in the future."
01:33:49;01:33:53;"And some people, you know, like the Velvet Underground or the always the classic example, right?"
01:33:53;01:34:01;"The Velvet Underground, not that popular at the time, but like are way more relatively popular and influential than people might have thought back then."
01:34:01;01:34:06;"And they sound weirdly contemporary, right? Like even today, you can put on a Velvet Underground record."
01:34:06;01:34:10;"And if I told you that was some kids in Ridgewood, you'd be like, oh, that kind of makes sense."
01:34:10;01:34:14;"So that's like a thing you can do, but it's not the only way that you can communicate."
01:34:14;01:34:19;"And a different way you can communicate is to communicate to like a bunch of listeners right now."
01:34:19;01:34:23;"I talk in the book a little bit about Rude by Magic. Remember that song?"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"Oh, yeah, of course."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"Why you gotta be so rude?"
01:34:28;01:34:33;"Yes. And like it was enormous back in whatever it was, 2014 or something."
01:34:33;01:34:36;"And then it kind of fades, right? And the group's reputation kind of fades."
01:34:36;01:34:42;"And I say in the book, like, maybe we can think about songs like that the same way we think about languages that are dying out."
01:34:42;01:34:49;"Like the last native speaker is finally dying. Like the last person who loved that song is dying at some point in the future."
01:34:49;01:34:53;"And like future generations will never again be able to speak that language."
01:34:53;01:34:58;"Like they'll never really be able to go back and understand why that song maybe was as big as it was."
01:34:58;01:35:03;"Like maybe we should value things that are kind of like disappearing in that way."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Maybe that's one way to celebrate pop."
01:35:05;01:35:10;"It's also a very interesting question because it's also, yeah, I'm sure you could write a whole other book about that."
01:35:10;01:35:14;"Cultural ideas of longevity and timelessness. Like, who knows?"
01:35:14;01:35:23;"Maybe when the last person who knows anything about you dies, your soul is set free and you enter into eternal bliss."
01:35:23;01:35:29;"So magic, one day, if nobody actually cares about that song, I'm sure it could also easily come back on TikTok."
01:35:29;01:35:31;"But let's say nobody ever cares about it again."
01:35:31;01:35:36;"Maybe their souls will taste eternal bliss and heaven."
01:35:36;01:35:41;"And meanwhile, Kanye will be trapped in some sort of like dimensional prison."
01:35:41;01:35:45;"And they'll say, ""Damn, I wish I didn't make music for the future."""
01:35:45;01:35:52;"I think about Elvis that way. Like when I was growing up, like Elvis had been dead for so long and he seemed like super immortal."
01:35:52;01:35:55;"Right? Like it's just like Elvis was just a fact of American life."
01:35:55;01:36:02;"I remember when this postal service had the big competition between you had to choose between the two different Elvis stamps."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Did you want the young Elvis stamp or the old Elvis stamp?"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Like Elvis was everywhere. Like it seemed like, okay, you've done it."
01:36:07;01:36:11;"You've achieved this thing and you're a permanent fixture in American life."
01:36:11;01:36:16;"I feel like Elvis is a lot less prominent now than he was in the 80s or 90s."
01:36:16;01:36:25;"I remember reading somewhere about how the market for Elvis memorabilia had crashed kind of just because like his fans were kind of like dying out."
01:36:25;01:36:33;"That's exactly what we were wondering about because before you came on, we were talking about there was just a big Grateful Dead Sotheby's auction."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"Yeah."
01:36:34;01:36:43;"And we're just kind of talking about like, yeah, well, these prices for just like a speaker or road case hold up in 25, 30 years."
01:36:43;01:36:54;"We just don't know. It's hard to say. So we're actually wondering aloud, are there examples of markets that crashed where somebody paid top dollar and probably assumed, well, this will only go up in value and it did not."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"So you're saying that that happened with Elvis stuff."
01:36:57;01:37:02;"That's what I read. I have to go back and look. I mean, the irony is like, of course, it happened with CDs."
01:37:02;01:37:08;"Like it's funny when I was a kid, if you'd asked me to rank how valuable my stuff was, right?"
01:37:08;01:37:15;"It would have been like CDs first, then vinyl, then cassettes, then T-shirts, which I think was absolutely backwards."
01:37:15;01:37:24;"Like if I had kept my Dead Kennedys T-shirts nice and crispy, that would be worth way more than the CDs, which absolutely no one cares about."
01:37:24;01:37:29;"But it's interesting because it's a different way to think about musical value."
01:37:29;01:37:38;"When I was growing up, musical value was often measured in albums. Like, yeah, there's a novelty song, but would anyone really buy the album?"
01:37:38;01:37:41;"Like, yeah, they had one single, but is anyone really buying the album?"
01:37:41;01:37:48;"And that doesn't really exist now in the same way. The idea that like, oh, you have to love something enough to make that investment."
01:37:48;01:37:52;"And that was the bar that you had to clear to be serious music. And that doesn't exist now."
01:37:52;01:38:02;"In fact, like if you think about the online marketplace, partly because people aren't making the decision of like what to buy and what to like part money with,"
01:38:02;01:38:10;"they sometimes aren't making those judgments. Like sometimes those judgments of good and bad are economic judgments linked to like, well, what would we pay for?"
01:38:10;01:38:18;"And maybe if you watch a TikTok video, like you don't actually have an opinion on whether it was like good or bad or how good was it."
01:38:18;01:38:23;"You're not like giving it a letter grade in your head. You're just like watching it and moving on to the next thing."
01:38:23;01:38:30;"So maybe there is a connection there between like paying money for something and valuing it in an aesthetic sense."
01:38:30;01:38:38;"Yeah, that's going to be very interesting to look back on the early TikTok era and see to what extent TikTok hits."
01:38:38;01:38:44;"And I'm sure sometimes they legitimately changed an artist's career or reintroduced a whole generation to the artist."
01:38:44;01:38:55;"And then how many times was a crazy TikTok hit just the same kind of one hit wonder we've had in every era where it's kind of like disposable came and went."
01:38:55;01:39:04;"Funny little trend wasn't particularly sticky, as they say. Well, maybe that's a good note to end on. Thanks so much for coming through."
01:39:04;01:39:08;"Thanks, man. This has been fun. There's so much to talk about. I hope you'll come back again."
01:39:08;01:39:15;"Everybody got to check out the new book, Major Labels, A History of Popular Music in Seven Genres. It's out now."
01:39:15;01:39:20;"This is exciting for me. I'm excited to be part of the Time Crisis cinematic universe."
01:39:20;01:39:25;"We're very happy to have you. Well, have a good one. We'll talk to you later."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"Bye. Peace."
01:39:27;01:39:36;"What do you think a set list, an Elvis Presley set list from 1969? I'm looking at Sotheby's right now."
01:39:36;01:39:46;"Oh, on really cool hotel stationery. What hotel? The International Hotel from 1969, 1970, The Midnight Show."
01:39:46;01:39:54;"And it's written by Elvis? I think so. A set list from a midnight show during Elvis's residency at the International Hotel Las Vegas."
01:39:54;01:40:01;"Ex Charlie Hodge, friend and confidant of Presley and member of his entourage. So maybe this guy."
01:40:01;01:40:06;"It's hard to believe that he wrote his own set list. It's hard to say it's some but it's handwritten."
01:40:06;01:40:13;"All right. That's going to take it down a few points for me, because if you could tell me that Elvis straight up wrote it,"
01:40:13;01:40:19;"I think it's going to increase the value. But still an important historical document. Elvis may have held it, looked at it."
01:40:19;01:40:26;"I OK, just to put in context, just to really think this through. If this was a Sotheby's thing and it said handwritten,"
01:40:26;01:40:32;"Grateful Dead set list, which they probably didn't write out set list too often, famously."
01:40:32;01:40:36;"But let's say something like that existed. You knew that somebody in the Grateful Dead crew wrote it."
01:40:36;01:40:42;"It was on cool hotel stationery and it was from 69, like a pretty like important, deep year."
01:40:42;01:40:48;"I bet that would go for at least 3000 bucks if it was on the Sotheby's thing."
01:40:48;01:40:56;"So is Elvis getting to that kind of number or is this more like 600 bucks? What is it?"
01:40:56;01:41:02;"4750. Four thousand seven hundred fifty dollars. Oh, OK. OK. Sorry, I said that in a weird way."
01:41:02;01:41:07;"I really would have believed either version if you told me to like, no, this actually forty seven dollars, fifty cents."
01:41:07;01:41:13;"Nobody gives it. I would buy it. OK, so that's like a pretty robust marketplace, I would say."
01:41:13;01:41:18;"I think that's very strong. But when did that sell? Do you have that information? I think it's 2016."
01:41:18;01:41:23;"It said, hold on, I'm sending it over. It's actually really cool. I actually kind of want this."
01:41:23;01:41:28;"All right, everybody, we're chipping in for Jake's birthday."
01:41:28;01:41:34;"Yes, that set list holding its value. Not seeing it. No. All right."
01:41:34;01:41:43;"Well, let's get in the top five. It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"So, Jake, we're just going to run through last week's top five that I missed. Right."
01:41:47;01:41:54;"That you missed. OK, cool. Number five is a group called Why Don't We."
01:41:54;01:42:14;"Do you remember them? No. They're a boy band called Why Don't We. And this is their song Love Back."
01:42:14;01:42:19;"This is a new boy band, you said? Yep. New boy band, Why Don't We."
01:42:19;01:42:24;"Is there any sort of Disney affiliation? Are they from Orlando? Yeah, what's the story with these guys?"
01:42:24;01:42:29;"Seinfeld got a good number crunch on Why Don't We? I don't remember."
01:42:29;01:42:35;"Yes, so they're from L.A. Five guys in the band. So sort of your classic NSYNC Backstreet Formation."
01:42:35;01:42:42;"Are they all white? Yes, they they all appear to be white."
01:42:42;01:42:49;"They're known as WDW to their fans. OK, they came out in 2016."
01:42:49;01:42:55;"That seems like a really aggressive move in this economy. Just five white guys in a boy band."
01:42:55;01:43:05;"Well, I just thought, like, maybe I'm idiotic here. Of the American boy bands, are they all white?"
01:43:05;01:43:10;"Historically, boy bands have been pretty segregated. Is there a multiracial boy band?"
01:43:10;01:43:14;"There were some multiracial R&B groups. None of the boy bands."
01:43:14;01:43:19;"O-Town was multiracial. O-Town was multiracial. They were one of the big ones."
01:43:19;01:43:25;"But, you know, the same way that you had New Edition and then they tried to make a white New Edition, New Kids on the Block."
01:43:25;01:43:28;"Right. It's pretty segregated."
01:43:37;01:43:42;"Sounds pretty good. OK, thumbs up from Jake. All right."
01:43:42;01:43:46;"I like the chorus. I mean, did we say he'd like this?"
01:43:46;01:43:51;"So you guys speculated on what I would think? Yeah, we speculated on what you would think."
01:43:51;01:43:59;"OK. You know, it's funny. Thumbs up. I haven't thought about WDW once since we recorded the last episode."
01:43:59;01:44:05;"WDW. It sounds like WMDs or something. WD40."
01:44:05;01:44:09;"We should put together a boy band called WMD."
01:44:09;01:44:15;"This is the rare acronym that's like longer than what it's shortening."
01:44:15;01:44:20;"It's awkward to say. Why don't we? It's like three times more syllables."
01:44:20;01:44:30;"W is three syllables. So Ezra said, quote, ""Early Jake would think this sucks, but he's been throwing curveballs lately,"
01:44:30;01:44:37;"I don't know if fatherhood just mellowed Jake out, but he might be like, catchy song, great beat, love these guys."""
01:44:37;01:44:45;"What are you reading? A transcript of the show? Seinfeld said it's too down the middle for Jake."
01:44:45;01:44:51;"Where are you reading this? I got my sources."
01:44:51;01:44:56;"No, we have a great producer. Matt killed it. Matt is sending all of Jake's takes."
01:44:56;01:45:03;"You don't know that we produce a limited edition bound transcript of every show. It's on really nice paper."
01:45:03;01:45:09;"You probably know we do it with a pretty cool art book publisher. You're probably aware of them."
01:45:09;01:45:12;"The name escapes me, but anyway, we do an edition of about 10."
01:45:12;01:45:15;"Damn. There's a copy on Sotheby's."
01:45:15;01:45:20;"We're at the top of the market, no doubt."
01:45:20;01:45:27;"TC Transcripts. I think the acronym should be DubD Dub instead of WDW."
01:45:27;01:45:31;"DubD Dub. DubD Dub."
01:45:31;01:45:37;"I can't even remember where this comes from. If it's from hipster runoff or just like CT kind of came up with it,"
01:45:37;01:45:41;"but internally often Vampire Weekend is called the Dubs."
01:45:41;01:45:44;"It's kind of a CT thing. He often calls it the Dubs."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"The Dubs. Nice."
01:45:46;01:45:53;"Yes, we're the Dubs, so they can't be the Dubs. But anyway, if there's any young men of any race, I might add,"
01:45:53;01:45:57;"who want to audition for WMD, we're putting it together."
01:45:57;01:46:02;"I feel like every few years we try to start a boy band. Rarely makes it past the episode."
01:46:02;01:46:07;"But one thing I know for sure is that the M of WMD stands for multiracial."
01:46:07;01:46:11;"I'm not sure about the W or the D. Actually, that could be it."
01:46:11;01:46:17;"It's like all the guys that are doing interviews, they're like, so you guys are WMD?"
01:46:17;01:46:21;"Like, what does it stand for? And they're just like, well, the M is for multiracial."
01:46:21;01:46:25;"And it's just like, that's right, Jason. The M is for multiracial."
01:46:25;01:46:30;"Like, absolutely. And just piggybacking off what Rodney said, the M is for multiracial."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"And the interviewer is like, OK, but what about the W or the D?"
01:46:34;01:46:39;"And they just kind of all look at each other, scratching their heads and just like, you know, right now we're mostly focusing on the M."
01:46:39;01:46:47;"The W and the D might be revealed. And I know we're all white, but we certainly support diversity."
01:46:47;01:46:51;"We're just going to find five white knuckleheads and send them on a press tour."
01:46:51;01:46:56;"And the only information they're armed with is that the M stands for multiracial."
01:46:56;01:47:01;"You know, it kind of implies that the band's name is Weapons of Multiracial Destruction."
01:47:01;01:47:06;"Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no."
01:47:06;01:47:09;"OK, WMD. All right. We're pulling the plug on WMD."
01:47:09;01:47:23;"That's a good turn. The number four song is, it's Elton John, old school legend and new school legend, Dua Lipa, coming together on Cold Heart, the Panao remix."
01:47:23;01:47:28;"So, Jake, this is a remix of a recent Elton John song."
01:47:28;01:47:31;"You're going to recognize some other familiar things."
01:47:32;01:47:41;"I'll say personally, I've gotten more and more into the song since two weeks ago."
01:47:41;01:47:46;"Where have you heard it? We were like kind of doing some family YouTube watching."
01:47:46;01:47:52;"And the video, the like thumbnail of this was like a cartoon."
01:47:52;01:47:55;"So our son wanted to watch that one."
01:47:55;01:47:58;"So then we threw it on and we're kind of grooving to it."
01:47:58;01:48:01;"And actually, it's like a fun, like vaguely anime video."
01:48:01;01:48:04;"I heard it again. I was like, you know what? I'm in. I like this."
01:48:04;01:48:08;"Who's singing? Is this Elton? That's autotuned Elton."
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Really?"
01:48:10;01:48:21;"What was that verse? That's like the new song. It's strange."
01:48:21;01:48:26;"It's like they kind of go through different Elton songs, but it's one song."
01:48:26;01:48:29;"No, no, no."
01:48:29;01:48:48;"I hear him there."
01:48:51;01:48:56;"That's such a classic, like Bernie Taupin line delivered perfectly by Elton."
01:48:56;01:48:59;"""Hard done by you."" It's like nobody else could do that."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"Yeah. It just actually sounds good coming from Elton."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"""Hard done by you."""
01:49:04;01:49:07;"Is Bernie Taupin actually kind of a bad lyricist?"
01:49:07;01:49:10;"Just Elton sells it really well."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Elton sells it."
01:49:12;01:49:15;"""Mars ain't the type of place to raise your kid."""
01:49:15;01:49:17;"Yeah, that's a clunker."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"""In fact, it's cold as hell."""
01:49:20;01:49:25;"Or even Daniel. Daniel's a sick song, but it's like the lyrics are whack."
01:49:25;01:49:30;"I looked up the chords to that to play on the guitar, which is a fun song to play,"
01:49:30;01:49:34;"but the lyrics are just so bad. I don't know."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"And it's weird that he was just like a lyricist."
01:49:36;01:49:39;"I mean, he's one of the most successful lyricists of all time."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I know. It's wild."
01:49:41;01:49:47;"I'll say that I like the weirdness of Tiny Dancer or Goodbye Yellow Brick Road."
01:49:47;01:49:51;"I think those weird turns of phrases, but they're kind of moving."
01:49:51;01:49:56;"And then he could just write a pretty straightforward, beautiful song like your song."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Yeah."
01:49:57;01:50:00;"I think those have some really great lyrics."
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Yeah, I guess there's some clunkers too."
01:50:02;01:50:05;"What is it where he goes, ""But then again, no."""
01:50:05;01:50:10;"""Or a man who makes potions for a traveling show."""
01:50:10;01:50:11;"I'm down."
01:50:11;01:50:12;"It's fun."
01:50:12;01:50:13;"Your song rules."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"Yeah, your song is a beautiful song."
01:50:15;01:50:20;"I wasn't so hot on this Dua Lipa/Elton collab. That was pretty weak."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"That's what Ezra said."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"Let's go to the transcript."
01:50:25;01:50:27;"Jake would love some early Elton John."
01:50:27;01:50:30;"I could see Jake not liking Auto-Tune to Elton."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"I don't see Jake liking this."
01:50:32;01:50:36;"I can see him saying, ""Give me a Tiny Dancer. Give me a Benny and the Jets."""
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Not feeling this one. No soul."
01:50:38;01:50:41;"Jake wouldn't like it because he loves the tasteful palette of the '70s."
01:50:41;01:50:43;"Jake wouldn't like the music."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"Pro-Elton, but wouldn't get the music."
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Basically, I think nailed it."
01:50:47;01:50:48;"Perfect."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Yeah. Verbatim."
01:50:49;01:50:50;"Nailed it."
01:50:50;01:50:53;"It's everything you thought and just didn't say."
01:50:53;01:50:58;"The number three song is Coldplay x BTS."
01:50:58;01:51:00;"This is the collab of the century."
01:51:00;01:51:06;"Now, I remember that we were wondering aloud on the last episode,"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"""Does Jake like Coldplay?"""
01:51:08;01:51:11;"We weren't sure what the answer would be."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"I said that I thought Jake would like Coldplay,"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"but I believe during--as we were discussing it,"
01:51:16;01:51:20;"Nick texted you, and you came back with ""Not a fan."""
01:51:20;01:51:22;"That's right. I do remember that."
01:51:22;01:51:25;"I signed off. I was on vacation."
01:51:25;01:51:28;"Then I'm getting texts from Nick."
01:51:28;01:51:31;"I'm not working today."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"I signed off early. I'm on vacay."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"I don't need these work texts coming in."
01:51:34;01:51:37;"I got the ""Oh, oh."""
01:51:37;01:51:41;"Jake was drinking the best margarita of his life on a beach in Hawaii."
01:51:41;01:51:42;"Absolutely. I don't need this."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Do you like Coldplay?"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"What the hell?"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"Nick Wyden--what the--"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Do I like Coldplay?"
01:51:49;01:51:52;"He turns to Hannah in the deck chair, making a face like,"
01:51:52;01:51:54;"""You see this sh*t?"""
01:51:54;01:51:57;"You see what I had to put up with?"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"The office won't leave me alone."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"You never like Coldplay?"
01:52:00;01:52:03;"Nick, really overstepping boundaries."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"Never really liked Coldplay."
01:52:06;01:52:07;"Not really a fan."
01:52:07;01:52:10;"Have you ever listened to a full Coldplay album?"
01:52:10;01:52:13;"I think so. I think in my brother's car once,"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"like 15 years ago."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"But no, I'm not going to actively put one on now."
01:52:17;01:52:19;"What about individual Coldplay songs?"
01:52:19;01:52:22;"Can you remember when ""Yellow"" came out, their first big hit?"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"I remember liking ""Yellow."""
01:52:23;01:52:26;"I remember thinking this was a Benz knockoff,"
01:52:26;01:52:29;"kind of like an early Radiohead knockoff."
01:52:29;01:52:33;"It was just that classic mainstream,"
01:52:33;01:52:38;"kind of alt-radio 25 years ago, or whenever that was."
01:52:38;01:52:41;"But I remember thinking, ""Oh, it's good though. It's catchy. I like it."""
01:52:41;01:52:42;"I like ""Yellow."""
01:52:42;01:52:43;"What about..."
01:52:43;01:52:50;"[hums ""Yellow""]"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"I just find them corny. Not my thing."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"What about the Chainsmokers collab?"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"Yeah, didn't you like that?"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"That's their best work."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"Okay, so you like Coldplay X Chainsmokers,"
01:52:59;01:53:02;"so you're more of a Coldplay collab guy."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Yeah."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"And where do you stand on BTS currently?"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Well, I have a long history with BTS."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"I've loved them for 23 years."
01:53:10;01:53:14;"I'm never going to not make the BTS joke on this show."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"You got to. You got to."
01:53:17;01:53:20;"I'm fully committed to that BTS joke every time."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"It's always funny."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"Anyway, here's the new Coldplay X BTS single."
01:53:25;01:53:27;"Jake, it's called ""My Universe."""
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Good title."
01:53:28;01:53:33;"♪ You, you are my universe and I ♪"
01:53:33;01:53:37;"♪ I just want to put you first ♪"
01:53:37;01:53:42;"♪ You, you are my universe and I ♪"
01:53:47;01:53:53;"♪ In the night I lie and look up at you ♪"
01:53:53;01:53:57;"♪ When the morning comes I watch you rise ♪"
01:53:57;01:54:00;"♪ There's a paradise that couldn't capture ♪"
01:54:00;01:54:04;"♪ That bright infinity inside your eyes ♪"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"♪ Every night I fly to you ♪"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"♪ I forget the things I've lost ♪"
01:54:08;01:54:11;"♪ I meet you with a smile ♪"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"♪ Never ending forever ♪"
01:54:13;01:54:18;"♪ Baby, you, you are my universe and I ♪"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"Yeah, Sam Field, I think you're right."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"I think my favorite Coldplay is their collabs."
01:54:23;01:54:25;"This is good."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"This is strong."
01:54:26;01:54:27;"This is not a bad song."
01:54:27;01:54:29;"It's uplifting."
01:54:29;01:54:31;"This is serviceable pop music."
01:54:31;01:54:35;"So Ezra said, ""Jake might like this one."
01:54:35;01:54:37;"It's fun with an 80s vibe."
01:54:37;01:54:40;"This song will probably make Jake want to look under the hood."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"What is Coldplay?"
01:54:41;01:54:42;"Does the drummer play on this song?"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"He'd want to get into the 'what's it about?'"""
01:54:45;01:54:47;"Oh yeah, Jake didn't actually take it there."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"It's an intriguing title."
01:54:48;01:54:51;"I thought that you might want to talk about"
01:54:51;01:54:55;"what does it mean that a band collab with a boy band."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"I thought you'd want to be like,"
01:54:56;01:54:59;"""Did the drummer of Coldplay play on this?"""
01:54:59;01:55:03;"I just assumed it was basically just Chris Martin doing vocals over a..."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"Yeah, is the bass player of Coldplay playing on this?"
01:55:06;01:55:07;"I mean, maybe?"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"I don't know."
01:55:09;01:55:10;"I guess it is."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"It's not Chris Martin that's built a spell."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"It's Coldplay."
01:55:13;01:55:18;"I do like the kind of haunting, sad 80s chords."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"What is it?"
01:55:19;01:55:22;"It makes me think of Betty Davis' eyes"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"or one of those kind of like..."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Oh yeah."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"Throw in Betty Davis' eyes,"
01:55:26;01:55:29;"like a slightly haunting 80s pop song."
01:55:29;01:55:34;"Maybe this was the inspiration."
01:55:34;01:55:50;"Who is this singer?"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"This song sounds cool."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Kim Carnes."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"Is she ultimately kind of a one-hit wonder?"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"I guess."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Such a cool, raspy voice."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"Cool."
01:56:02;01:56:05;"You won't have to think twice"
01:56:05;01:56:09;"She's pure as New York snow"
01:56:09;01:56:14;"She got Betty Davis' eyes"
01:56:14;01:56:20;"If she teases you, she'll unease you"
01:56:20;01:56:24;"I'll prepare to just to please you"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"She's precocious"
01:56:26;01:56:32;"And she knows just what it takes to make a problem"
01:56:32;01:56:36;"She got Betty Davis' eyes"
01:56:36;01:56:41;"She's got Betty Davis' eyes"
01:56:41;01:56:45;"It's funny, like the changes are very subtle."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Yeah."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"It's like the same dynamics the whole song"
01:56:48;01:56:51;"and the chords sort of like shift subtly underneath."
01:56:51;01:56:55;"Yeah, like that little walk down into the chorus."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"Very sophisticated."
01:56:56;01:56:59;"But it's not like, ""Oh, s***, here comes the chorus, get ready."""
01:56:59;01:57:00;"Right."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"It's very chill, like the whole time."
01:57:03;01:57:06;"Was this song before like Time After Time?"
01:57:06;01:57:09;"Did this song invent the kind of like quiet,"
01:57:09;01:57:14;"like 80s, like sad guitar, like slightly palm-muted vibe?"
01:57:14;01:57:16;"Time After Time is what, '83?"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"I bet this is before."
01:57:18;01:57:20;"It was written in '74."
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Whoa."
01:57:21;01:57:24;"It was written by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon."
01:57:24;01:57:25;"Oh."
01:57:25;01:57:28;"Who, she had other big hits, Jackie DeShannon,"
01:57:28;01:57:32;"but they recorded it in '74, but it was made popular by Kim Carnes in '81."
01:57:32;01:57:34;"Oh, this is a cover."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"So this is before the Cyndi Lauper then."
01:57:37;01:57:41;"I feel like this recording though is very influential for the 80s."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"Even like an influence on like I'm on fire."
01:57:43;01:57:45;"Oh yeah, totally."
01:57:45;01:57:49;"Skeletal, haunting, 80s pop."
01:57:49;01:57:52;"Alright, the number two song."
01:57:52;01:57:54;"This one's exciting, Jake."
01:57:54;01:57:58;"Friend of the show, Ed Sheeran, has a new new single."
01:57:58;01:58:01;"I'm sure you've probably been hearing Bad Habits Everywhere,"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"the one that came out a couple months ago,"
01:58:04;01:58:07;"but this is a new new single called Shivers."
01:58:07;01:58:10;"Shiver me timbers."
01:58:10;01:58:12;"We actually didn't."
01:58:12;01:58:16;"We were so struck by one of the lyrics that we actually didn't,"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"we didn't get the Jake's take."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"We forgot to talk about what Jake's take."
01:58:35;01:58:38;"If you remember that's what we talked a lot about."
01:58:38;01:58:41;"Oh yeah, lipstick on my guitar."
01:58:41;01:58:44;"Yeah, what situation is there lipstick on his guitar?"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"He's a rock star."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"He goes under the front, right?"
01:58:48;01:58:52;"He's on the front row that jumps up and kisses his guitar."
01:58:52;01:58:54;"Interesting."
01:59:11;01:59:14;"Ed is so rough."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"I thought you liked Ed."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"What have I ever been down with Ed?"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"I was only laughing because you said shiver me timbers in the beginning."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"So I was picturing if the chorus is like,"
01:59:23;01:59:26;"""Oh, I love it when you shiver my timbers."""
01:59:26;01:59:29;"That kind of could be a pop song."
01:59:29;01:59:32;"Shiver my timbers."
01:59:32;01:59:36;"That's going to be the first single for our boy band, WMD."
01:59:36;01:59:40;"It's called Shiver My Timbers."
01:59:40;01:59:42;"The album has sort of a nautical theme."
01:59:47;01:59:49;"I like the vibe of the song."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"I think it's the best Ed single in a while, actually."
01:59:51;01:59:53;"I agree with that."
02:00:17;02:00:19;"What does that even mean?"
02:00:19;02:00:21;"Shiver my timbers."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"What are your timbers?"
02:00:23;02:00:26;"[Laughter]"
02:00:26;02:00:30;"All right, Seinfeld, we need a crunch."
02:00:30;02:00:33;"Shiver me timbers."
02:00:38;02:00:40;"This part is cool."
02:00:48;02:00:51;"My timbers."
02:00:53;02:00:55;"My timbers."
02:00:55;02:00:58;"Timbers, you made me shiver my timbers."
02:01:01;02:01:04;"It's an exclamation for shock."
02:01:04;02:01:12;"It comes from, ""In the heavy seas, ships would be lifted up and pounded down so hard as to shiver the timbers, startling the sailors."""
02:01:12;02:01:21;"I went to a dinner party a little while ago where they had a tradition at this house where the party was."
02:01:21;02:01:23;"It was kind of fun."
02:01:23;02:01:34;"I don't know the whole back story, but basically the host would write a bunch of cards with a task on it, or almost like something you had to do."
02:01:34;02:01:39;"Then at random, they would put them on everybody's plate, and you'd look at it."
02:01:39;02:01:46;"Maybe what you had to do was something over the course of the dinner, and you had to do it very naturally, but it would be something a little bit funny."
02:01:46;02:01:54;"A mellow one would be, ""Tell three different people at the dinner that you're psychic and make a prediction for them."""
02:01:54;02:01:56;"That sounds stressful."
02:01:56;02:01:57;"Yeah, it was a little stressful."
02:01:57;02:02:02;"Or a more aggressive one would be, ""Complain about the food loudly."""
02:02:02;02:02:03;"Something like that."
02:02:03;02:02:13;"I guess the point of the game, it's really just to have fun and be silly, but you want to do it naturally so that at the end when everybody guesses, it's not obvious what your card was."
02:02:13;02:02:16;"If you get something kind of kooky, you could do it."
02:02:16;02:02:24;"Anyway, I kept thinking after that dinner party about, ""Well, what would a good one be if I ever had to write my own or come up with them?"""
02:02:24;02:02:32;"I think a good one would be, ""Tell somebody you have to use the phrase 'shiver me timbers' over the course of the dinner."""
02:02:32;02:02:38;"Even though we're not at a dinner party together, I just want to say to anybody listening, if we can kind of play this game,"
02:02:38;02:02:46;"your assignment for the next two weeks is at least five times just very casually use the phrase ""shiver me timbers"" in conversation."
02:02:46;02:02:52;"If you're really good at it, you'll be amazed that most people won't really have time to say, ""What the f*ck did you just say?"""
02:02:52;02:02:56;"Maybe come downstairs and just be like, ""Maybe you're in a rush."""
02:02:56;02:02:58;"""Shiver me timbers, I'm late for school."""
02:02:58;02:03:00;"Anyway, thanks for the English muffin, mom."
02:03:00;02:03:04;"If anybody gives you a hard time about it, say like, ""Oh, what do you do, like a pirate?"""
02:03:04;02:03:08;"Say like, ""No, no, no. Dude, the pirates used this like 300 years ago."""
02:03:08;02:03:10;"It's kind of like actually trendy to say this now."
02:03:10;02:03:12;"Wait, Nick, were you just saying something?"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"Did you see Succession on Sunday?"
02:03:14;02:03:17;"Shiver me timbers, I forgot it was on."
02:03:17;02:03:19;"Oh, well that's good."
02:03:19;02:03:21;"That's real good."
02:03:21;02:03:27;"Can I propose that we make this the time crisis shiver me timbers TikTok challenge?"
02:03:27;02:03:35;"Hashtag, try to capture some naturalistic moments of this happening as part of our ongoing TikTok campaign."
02:03:35;02:03:37;"Co-run by me and Jake."
02:03:37;02:03:40;"Shiver me timbers, I forgot it was on."
02:03:40;02:03:41;"I love this idea."
02:03:41;02:03:47;"That's probably the easiest one when you're making the TikTok challenge is just to do it about some sort of live event."
02:03:47;02:03:53;"You know, just to frame yourself with your family and you know, just say, ""Oh, shiver me timbers, the Dodgers are playing."""
02:03:53;02:03:55;"All right, the number one song this week."
02:03:55;02:04:00;"Well, Jake, I know you know this one, so I don't think we really commented or guessed what you might think."
02:04:00;02:04:04;"Because it's called Fancy Like and it's by Walker Hayes."
02:04:04;02:04:05;"You remember this?"
02:04:05;02:04:07;"All right. Vaguely."
02:04:11;02:04:13;"It's got a good feel."
02:04:15;02:04:20;"This riff kind of reminds me of like, kind of gives me like a, like a Let It Be vibe."
02:04:20;02:04:21;"Oh, yeah."
02:04:21;02:04:24;"Not the song, but like the record, the Beatles record."
02:04:24;02:04:26;"Like I dig a pony that riff."
02:04:26;02:04:31;"Yeah, like that kind of vibe or like, yeah, it's real I dig a pony vibe."
02:04:31;02:04:37;"And now I'm just picturing the Beatles in '69 on the roof of the Apple building playing this song."
02:04:37;02:04:39;"[Laughter]"
