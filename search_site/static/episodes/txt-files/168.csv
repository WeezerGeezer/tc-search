00:00;00:08;"Super Gremlins, Pop-Tarts, Menu Hacks, and Folgers Coffee."
00:08;00:14;"There's a lot of hot topics to discuss on this week's Time Crisis."
00:14;00:21;"We'll dive into some corporate food history, but don't worry, we'll never forget the music."
00:21;00:24;"The beautiful music that we all love."
00:24;00:29;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:29;00:30;"Koenig!"
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"The world I felt, wobbly, all my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis back again."
01:19;01:21;"What's up, Jake?"
01:21;01:22;"Hey."
01:22;01:23;"How you doing?"
01:23;01:25;"Wiped out, man. I've been sleeping like crap."
01:25;01:29;"I haven't slept well either. You just wake up in the middle of the night?"
01:29;01:34;"Yeah, it just happens periodically where I'll have a week where I just don't sleep well."
01:34;01:40;"I'll fall asleep at like 10, 10.30, and then I'm awake at like 1, and then I'm just up."
01:40;01:44;"Classic. I know the feeling. And are you getting out of bed level of up?"
01:44;01:45;"Yep."
01:45;01:46;"What do you do?"
01:46;01:53;"Well, last night I read a good portion of the Chuck Klosserman book, The 90s."
01:53;01:58;"It's a new Chuck Klosserman book about the 90s, and it's been sitting on my bedside table"
01:58;02:00;"and I haven't had a chance to crack it."
02:00;02:06;"And then I haven't been sleeping, so I read the chapter on Nirvana last night."
02:06;02:08;"Or on Nevermind, I should say."
02:08;02:10;"You might be a good guest."
02:10;02:16;"But anyway, yeah, that's what I do. I get up out of bed and I read or I try to switch gears."
02:16;02:23;"And you get out of bed because it would be too disturbing to your wife to turn the light on in the bedroom and read?"
02:23;02:27;"Yeah. I've read that if you can't sleep, you should get out of bed."
02:27;02:28;"Really?"
02:28;02:30;"And like change locations."
02:30;02:33;"It's the opposite of getting kidnapped."
02:33;02:38;"Do you know this thing people say when you get kidnapped, like never let them change locations?"
02:38;02:40;"That's a thing, right?"
02:40;02:42;"News to me, but OK."
02:42;02:47;"Would you know that only from a movie? I mean, is that what you heard in the movie?"
02:47;02:50;"Not from people I know who've been kidnapped."
02:50;02:52;"Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch."
02:52;02:55;"Is this the thing that when you get kidnapped, don't let them change locations?"
02:55;02:57;"Yeah, maybe it's from a movie."
02:57;03:01;"When you really think about it, it seems like, I mean, just it seems like go with the flow."
03:01;03:03;"Preserve your life first and foremost."
03:03;03:05;"Is this the show? Are we recording?"
03:05;03:06;"Yeah."
03:06;03:08;"You couldn't tell?"
03:08;03:15;"You thought we were just making small talk about random sh*t?"
03:15;03:17;"Yeah, a little bit."
03:17;03:20;"The internet radio show about nothing."
03:20;03:22;"Yeah, maybe it is from some dumb movie."
03:22;03:27;"Because yeah, like if you're kidnapped, I think like the last thing you got to worry about is like,"
03:27;03:30;"oh, they changed locations. Now it's going to be harder to find you."
03:30;03:32;"Let's stay alive."
03:32;03:37;"Yeah, I feel like if they're changing locations, that actually might help you because they're on the move."
03:37;03:38;"Maybe they'll get caught."
03:38;03:39;"Yeah."
03:39;03:44;"If they're just locked down in some like obscure building, I mean, how would they ever find you?"
03:44;03:50;"Also, if you're the one who's been kidnapped, you really don't have much of a say in any of the situation."
03:50;03:52;"You know what I mean? It's like, what are you going to tell them? No, don't."
03:52;03:55;"Yeah, no, it's somehow this got in my head."
03:55;04:01;"So it's like, I wonder if other people heard this and there was somebody somewhere who got kidnapped and they're just like,"
04:01;04:04;"okay, the only thing I got to do is don't let them change locations."
04:04;04:07;"And the guy was like, all right, saddle up, saddle up gang."
04:07;04:08;"We're getting in the car."
04:08;04:11;"And the person was just like, no."
04:11;04:14;"And then things went sideways."
04:14;04:18;"Guys, my dad is like a really badass CIA operator."
04:18;04:21;"He's going to find me whether you move or not."
04:21;04:22;"He's going to find you and kill you."
04:22;04:29;"I'm not seeing a lot about this, but I am on a website from Pinkerton, which seems like it's a high level security company."
04:29;04:31;"And that's a famous detective agency."
04:31;04:32;"Oh, there you go."
04:32;04:37;"There's an article about executives getting kidnapped in foreign places."
04:37;04:45;"And they advise that any executive who's moving from a location to location, let people know at each point where they've gone to,"
04:45;04:48;"which is not exactly what you're talking about, but."
04:48;04:50;"Oh, that's just letting people know where you are."
04:50;04:51;"Anytime."
04:51;04:51;"Okay."
04:51;04:58;"Maybe I made this up and I just really want to say that anybody listening double check that before you ever, if you're ever in that situation."
04:58;04:59;"Okay."
04:59;05:02;"But anyway, so Jake, you heard ABCL."
05:02;05:07;"If you can't sleep, just remember ABCL always be changing locations."
05:07;05:08;"Yes."
05:08;05:12;"So you grab the book, hit the couch, go back to bed."
05:12;05:17;"Like, I don't know, some absurd hour, 345."
05:17;05:19;"Yeah, just a solid two and a half."
05:19;05:22;"I didn't read the book for two and a half."
05:22;05:27;"I looked at the phone, read the book, sat outside for a while."
05:27;05:29;"That's the vibe."
05:29;05:30;"At what?"
05:30;05:32;"Like three in the morning?"
05:32;05:33;"Yeah."
05:33;05:35;"And then I was like, I'm going to try to go back to bed."
05:35;05:36;"It's tough."
05:36;05:37;"Yeah."
05:37;05:38;"Waking up in the middle of the night stuff."
05:38;05:39;"How about you?"
05:39;05:40;"What's your technique?"
05:40;05:41;"I don't know."
05:41;05:45;"Sometimes I try just to like go inside my consciousness and just like chill out and"
05:45;05:47;"see if that'll help me sleep."
05:47;05:53;"In extreme circumstances, I've gone to the living room and watch TV."
05:53;05:56;"I have a memory of waking up in the middle of the night and being like having that, you"
05:56;05:59;"know, that feeling of just like, I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep."
05:59;06:00;"I might as well do something."
06:00;06:05;"And then I went in the living room and the late nineties Scorsese film, bringing out"
06:05;06:07;"the dead, which I'd never seen."
06:07;06:08;"Perfect."
06:08;06:11;"It was either on TV or it was like streaming."
06:11;06:14;"And I was like, Oh, you know, I like Martin Scorsese."
06:14;06:19;"I should see, I should, you know, fill out my viewing of his work."
06:19;06:22;"And so I threw that on, that entire movie takes place at night."
06:22;06:26;"It's almost like a spiritual sequel to taxi driver."
06:26;06:28;"Cause it's all about New York at night."
06:28;06:31;"And it's Nicholas Cage plays this EMT."
06:31;06:37;"Who's always driving around New York, working at this like really up hospital in Hell's"
06:37;06:38;"kitchen."
06:38;06:40;"And also he can't sleep."
06:40;06:44;"So it was a very memorable nighttime viewing."
06:44;06:46;"It was like this weird movie about insomnia."
06:46;06:48;"Yeah, that's perfect."
06:48;06:52;"I also find the classic feeling of you fall asleep hard."
06:52;06:55;"You wake up at some ungodly hour."
06:55;07:01;"And then from then until when you wake up for real, it's very unclear what happened."
07:01;07:04;"Have you ever had that where it's like, you say like, yeah, I remember I woke up at"
07:04;07:05;"three 30."
07:05;07:06;"I looked at my phone."
07:06;07:07;"It was three 30."
07:07;07:10;"I know I was like up at some point."
07:10;07:12;"And the next thing I know was seven 30."
07:12;07:13;"Did I sleep?"
07:13;07:14;"I don't even remember."
07:14;07:18;"You know that feeling like I must have, but I feel like I was asleep."
07:18;07:22;"You're not fully out, but you're like, Whoa, you look at your phone again."
07:22;07:23;"It's like that was an hour and a half."
07:23;07:25;"I must've been sort of asleep."
07:25;07:26;"Yeah."
07:26;07:27;"Anyway, not fun."
07:27;07:28;"Yeah."
07:28;07:29;"I think it comes in waves."
07:29;07:32;"I move locations once a week."
07:32;07:33;"What do you mean?"
07:33;07:38;"I mean, it's a lot better now, but I wake up so hard in the middle of the night."
07:38;07:39;"Yeah."
07:39;07:40;"Do you got ABC?"
07:40;07:41;"Yeah."
07:41;07:42;"ABCL always."
07:42;07:43;"And it definitely works."
07:43;07:45;"Sometimes I'll do like three locations in the night."
07:45;07:48;"Now, are you trying to sleep in these locations or are you just reading?"
07:48;07:50;"Like, no, no, no."
07:50;07:53;"It will be I'll wake up and my bed."
07:53;07:59;"I'm just picturing the, you know, that like kind of famous photo set of Quentin Tarantino."
07:59;08:01;"You see on the internet a lot."
08:01;08:02;"It's like he was shot."
08:02;08:07;"I think in his house with like kind of like bright flash photography and he just it's"
08:07;08:09;"like all these weird sideways shots of him."
08:09;08:13;"Like just like standing in his dining room with like kind of an uncomfortable look on"
08:13;08:14;"his face."
08:14;08:17;"Just like as if it's he's not sure where he is."
08:17;08:19;"He was caught."
08:19;08:20;"I don't know those photos at all."
08:20;08:21;"Wow."
08:21;08:25;"I think he must have woken up in the middle of the night and just walked around his house"
08:25;08:29;"just being like, hmm, stand in your dining room for five minutes."
08:29;08:31;"But yeah, so you go, where do you go?"
08:31;08:32;"Do you go sit in a chair?"
08:32;08:33;"Do you read?"
08:33;08:35;"No, it's only to sleep."
08:35;08:40;"I really try to not engage with like a screen, maybe read."
08:40;08:45;"But since college, like if I woke up and I would go and just like sleep on the couch"
08:45;08:46;"or something."
08:46;08:47;"So here I'll wake up."
08:47;08:53;"I'll go to the guest room or if like Max is out, I'd go try to sleep with Max."
08:53;08:57;"Like if he's like at a sleepover or something, I'll go sleep in his bed or go to a couch."
08:57;09:02;"I'll just do anywhere to just try to get out of the current situation I'm in."
09:02;09:04;"And I do it does mainly work."
09:04;09:06;"It's like I think tossing and turning in bed."
09:06;09:11;"I also find it even though a man is a pretty heavy sleeper."
09:11;09:17;"I feel like if I toss and turn and me this is if I'm up and the person next to me is asleep."
09:17;09:22;"It's just like that's a raps as bad vibes and I want to be able to kind of toss and turn."
09:22;09:25;"So that's I think that that's a big deal."
09:25;09:29;"I would always be moving locations."
09:29;09:30;"ABML."
09:31;09:35;"Go without"
09:35;09:40;"Till the need seeps in"
09:40;09:45;"You know anymore"
09:45;09:54;"Collect your novel petals for the stem"
09:55;10:04;"And glow glow melt and flow"
10:04;10:09;"You disarray your fragile frame"
10:09;10:13;"Spill it out in ragged flow"
10:13;10:22;"A thousand different versions of your soul"
10:23;10:36;"Well, it's tough if you live in a studio apartment, I guess if I lived in a studio apartment, I would try I'd hit the floor then I'd get back in bed, but kind of like do a 180 head on the bottom feet up top."
10:36;10:44;"I think there's ways you could still apply this technique in studio apartment pillow in the bathtub classic wake up in the bathtub."
10:44;10:45;"Ouch."
10:45;10:47;"Have you guys ever slept in the bathtub?"
10:47;10:49;"No, how the hell would you do that?"
10:49;10:50;"It seems so uncomfortable."
10:50;10:57;"I feel like that way you said it like you have you I mean, I think I have maybe once or twice."
10:57;10:58;"I mean, I don't know."
10:58;11:00;"I think maybe I shifted timelines."
11:00;11:01;"I feel like I live."
11:01;11:10;"I used to live in a world where everybody knew that you never change locations with a kidnapper and everybody sleeps in a bathtub once or twice."
11:10;11:23;"You know, I don't know, like some weird situation where you go to like a party and everybody like stays and everybody's looking for a place to crash and somebody like gets the good couch and then somebody's left with the bathtub."
11:23;11:24;"That's a thing, right?"
11:24;11:26;"I mean, I would just sleep on the floor."
11:26;11:29;"Maybe these are all from any random piece of floor than a bathtub."
11:29;11:34;"Yeah, but if you insulate a bathtub, like if it's big enough, you line it with some nice blankets and pillows."
11:34;11:38;"I feel like you can make a pretty luxurious cozy bathtub to sleep in."
11:38;11:41;"I know that's not what Ezra is quite talking about."
11:41;11:44;"That's more of like a makeshift thing, but you can make it nice."
11:44;11:47;"I think Ezra is confusing his life with movies."
11:47;11:48;"It's possible."
11:48;11:49;"You know what?"
11:49;11:53;"I'm going to sleep in the bathtub tonight just to see how it goes."
11:53;11:55;"I'll report back in two weeks."
11:55;11:56;"Please do."
11:56;11:58;"We got a lot of good corporate food."
11:58;12:00;"Yeah, this week."
12:00;12:05;"In fact, I feel like we've almost been too focused on music the past few years."
12:05;12:08;"Years?"
12:08;12:11;"I do feel like this show has become very music-centric."
12:11;12:18;"I think the show is better if it's music-centric with just a sprinkling of corporate food."
12:18;12:22;"I think if we go overboard with corporate food, it starts to get stagnant."
12:22;12:24;"That's my personal feeling."
12:24;12:27;"Jake, what's your ideal corp food to music ratio for an episode?"
12:27;12:29;"15 to 85."
12:29;12:31;"Whoa, 85 music?"
12:31;12:32;"Yeah."
12:32;12:33;"Wow."
12:33;12:34;"That's me."
12:34;12:35;"Just a sprinkling?"
12:35;12:39;"Yeah, but corporate food, when you say corporate food, I think in the history of time crisis,"
12:39;12:48;"that has a very specific meaning, which is not just us talking about some funny Twitter"
12:48;12:51;"account, Stake 'Em's type thing."
12:51;12:54;"Corporate food history is when we really get in the weeds."
12:54;13:01;"We're getting into years, various types of corporations, really breaking down the private"
13:01;13:02;"equity firms."
13:02;13:04;"A deep dive on Panda Express."
13:04;13:07;"When I say corporate food, it's not just corporate food history."
13:07;13:11;"We have a lot of food stuff-related content, and I think it's all A+."
13:11;13:12;"That's great."
13:12;13:16;"Like you said, you haven't done it in a while, so I think we're going to make up for lost"
13:16;13:17;"time."
13:17;13:20;"I want to maintain a strict 80/20 ratio."
13:20;13:22;"I think we do have that, generally."
13:22;13:23;"Over the long haul."
13:23;13:25;"Over the long haul, we're 80/20."
13:25;13:29;"I've heard from some listeners that they like the music stuff, the corporate food stuff,"
13:29;13:30;"not so much."
13:30;13:32;"All right."
13:32;13:36;"Well, guys, if you're one of those people, if you're one of those weird people who prefers"
13:36;13:40;"music to corporate food history, just give this one a chance, because this is all good"
13:40;13:41;"stuff."
13:41;13:42;"Yep."
13:42;13:43;"This is not going to be dry, I don't think."
13:43;13:44;"And you know what?"
13:44;13:48;"And if it gets dry, we can talk about the Grateful Dead."
13:48;13:52;"This is a Grateful Dead podcast."
13:52;13:55;"I did actually come across a random Grateful Dead thing."
13:55;13:58;"This is almost so- Okay, this is a good example of how we can get too into music."
13:58;14:03;"I was watching an interview on YouTube with the guitarist Richard Lloyd."
14:03;14:06;"Jake, you know who Richard Lloyd is?"
14:06;14:07;"I don't."
14:07;14:08;"Anybody?"
14:08;14:09;"No."
14:09;14:11;"None of you guys know who Richard Lloyd is?"
14:11;14:12;"Give me a hint."
14:12;14:19;"He was the second guitarist in an iconic band who made one absolutely incredible album that"
14:19;14:21;"people still talk about today."
14:21;14:22;"Television?"
14:22;14:23;"Yes."
14:23;14:25;"I don't know how I knew that."
14:25;14:26;"I just- Yep."
14:26;14:27;"Great call, Jake."
14:27;14:28;"Thank you."
14:28;14:34;"Television is very fascinating in that the album Marquee Moon is so good and so iconic."
14:34;14:35;"Yep."
14:35;14:36;"And then they basically just dipped."
14:36;14:38;"They made one more album people don't particularly like."
14:38;14:42;"It has some decent songs and they made one more album on adventure."
14:42;14:46;"And then they made a self-titled, I think, in the 90s."
14:46;14:47;"It's pretty good."
14:47;14:52;"But it's just like- And then Tom Verlaine's solo work, he has a couple songs."
14:52;14:55;"People like- There's one song called Kingdom Come that David Bowie covered."
14:55;15:01;"But just like the level- I was listening to the song Marquee Moon, which of course you could-"
15:01;15:06;"People did call them the Grateful Dead of Punk because it is this like jammy song."
15:06;15:08;"Although it's very composed."
15:08;15:12;"But it's like a 10-minute song with peaks and valleys and like guitar interplay."
15:12;15:18;"Anyway, I was watching an interview where Chris Franz from Talking Heads was interviewing Richard Lloyd."
15:18;15:21;"Richard Lloyd seems like kind of a funny character."
15:21;15:22;"Good vibe."
15:22;15:25;"And anyway, he was just talking about growing up in New York."
15:25;15:29;"And Chris Franz says, ""Yeah, I heard you knew Hendrix."""
15:29;15:32;"And he's like, ""Yeah, you know, I was like a New York kid."
15:32;15:34;"I'd go out to shows."
15:34;15:36;"I met this guy, he knew Hendrix."
15:36;15:39;"And yeah, you know, he showed me a few things on the guitar like I was around."
15:39;15:41;"You know, we would go to all the shows, man."
15:41;15:46;"You know, we used to have a pretty good trick because back in those days you could walk right into Soundcheck."
15:46;15:49;"So, you know, you go to the film or something, you walk right into the Soundcheck."
15:49;15:51;"Nobody would ask you for a ticket or anything."
15:51;15:57;"You could go right up to the band and say, ""Hey, listen, could I get on your guest list later for the show I broke?"""
15:57;16:01;"And then Chris Franz is like, ""Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool."""
16:01;16:02;"And he's like, ""You know, I did that all the time."
16:02;16:07;"You know, man, I'd walk into the film or, you know, I'd walk right up to Jerry Garcia and I'd say,"
16:07;16:11;"'Hey, man, can I get on your list?' And Jerry said, 'No, man. Sorry, I got all these music people.'"""
16:11;16:16;"And then he'd say, ""Hold on a second. Hey, Phil. Phil, will you put this kid on his list?"""
16:16;16:19;"Phil Lesch says, ""Yeah, sure. I'll put the kid on the list."""
16:19;16:22;"It's like this really brief moment."
16:22;16:31;"I was going really deep that day, but I was kind of like, ""All right, that rules that there's one confirmed Grateful Dead television connection."""
16:31;16:35;"I wonder if you went to Phil Lesch right now and you were just like, ""Do you know who Richard Lloyd is?"""
16:35;16:39;"Or do you think Phil Lesch would know television?"
16:39;16:40;"No."
16:40;16:43;"That's a shame. He really should."
16:43;16:47;"I could be wrong. I think he'd be like, ""I've heard of him. Yeah."""
16:47;16:51;"Yeah, maybe by 1977, he was just in a different world."
16:51;16:52;"Yeah."
16:52;16:57;"That's like a different generation. He might not even know he put Richard Lloyd on his guest list."
16:57;17:04;"I remember how the darkness doubled"
17:04;17:11;"I recall lightning struck itself"
17:11;17:20;"I was listening, listening to the rain"
17:22;17:28;"I was hearing, hearing something else"
17:28;17:34;"Anyway, that's a little music for you. That's some really deep music."
17:34;17:38;"It's time for Corporate Food History."
17:38;17:40;"Let's talk about it."
17:40;17:48;"The first thing I want to talk about real quick is this McDonald's secret hacks menu."
17:48;17:50;"I just don't understand it."
17:50;17:55;"I was looking at the McDonald's website because I had a plan with some..."
17:55;17:57;"As you do."
17:57;17:58;"As one does."
17:58;18:00;"Just casually browsing."
18:00;18:05;"This is what I do all day. I watch Richard Lloyd interviews on YouTube and I browse the McDonald's website."
18:05;18:07;"God, your life. I'm jealous."
18:07;18:08;"It's pretty good."
18:08;18:11;"All that time you have, it's amazing. I love it."
18:11;18:13;"Yeah, I mean, it's part of my creative process."
18:13;18:14;"Absolutely."
18:14;18:17;"Your work is very labor intensive, Jake, the painting."
18:17;18:24;"Mine, I just need that right combo of a YouTube video and a McDonald's menu item and I go to the piano for five minutes."
18:24;18:25;"Boom."
18:25;18:26;"Inspiration strikes."
18:26;18:28;"Another hit."
18:28;18:36;"So anyway, I was doing that and the truth was it was because I had a music industry meeting with people"
18:36;18:41;"and it had been thrown out there, should we order McDonald's breakfast for this meeting in a couple of days?"
18:41;18:43;"Because it was going to be a breakfast meeting."
18:43;18:45;"So I'm looking at the McDonald's menu."
18:45;18:47;"Wait, hold on. Slow down. Slow down."
18:47;18:49;"So the breakfast would be delivered?"
18:49;18:54;"Yeah, I was meeting up with some people we work with. I was going to play them some demos and stuff."
18:54;18:58;"So it was just discussed, oh, we can meet at so-and-so's office."
18:58;19:00;"Should we order breakfast?"
19:00;19:03;"And I don't know, people were just throwing out stuff and it's probably me at some point."
19:03;19:05;"I was like, should we do McDonald's breakfast?"
19:05;19:08;"And people were like, I mean, in the end, we didn't."
19:08;19:10;"Anyway, that sent me to the McDonald's website."
19:10;19:12;"Now everybody on the thread is looking at the McDonald's website."
19:12;19:15;"Well, you know, if we do, I'll get a McGriddle. I haven't had one in a while."
19:15;19:17;"You know, whatever. The conversation."
19:17;19:20;"And then somebody said, look at this."
19:20;19:22;"What is this land, air and sea thing?"
19:22;19:24;"And then I look at the website and I'm like, yeah, what is this?"
19:24;19:30;"And it's this giant burger that has, it's called land, air and sea because it has the Big Mac."
19:30;19:32;"That's the land. The McChicken."
19:32;19:35;"That's the air because the chicken can kind of fly."
19:35;19:37;"And then a filet of fish because that's the sea."
19:37;19:40;"And it's all three are put together in this monstrous, I guess you'd call it,"
19:40;19:44;"they used to call that a Dagwood, you know, a giant multi-layered sandwich."
19:44;19:46;"You know, this thing is probably about a foot high."
19:46;19:49;"It's as if all three had been combined."
19:49;19:53;"And it said, this is a special limited edition thing on the menu."
19:53;19:56;"And it was under this category called menu hacks."
19:56;20:00;"So already this thing seems so confused because generally speaking,"
20:00;20:05;"a hack is some sort of unofficial way to do something."
20:05;20:07;"You know what I mean? It's like to call it."
20:07;20:11;"Well, famously T-Pain on our show said, right."
20:11;20:18;"As a hack, you order his, if I remember right, it's like you order a chili and then you also order a,"
20:18;20:21;"I mean, I might need a, you know, a number crunch on this, but it was like,"
20:21;20:25;"if you order a chili with extra cheese or you mash up the crackers and yeah."
20:25;20:28;"And then you ask for crackers and then you basically create your own meal based on other."
20:28;20:29;"That's a hack."
20:29;20:32;"See, and that makes sense because you use the official menu,"
20:32;20:41;"but then using your own unofficial ingenuity and using the esoteric knowledge of the streets,"
20:41;20:46;"of the community, whatever you want to call it, of your, the subculture that you're a part of,"
20:46;20:50;"the punk rockers, whatever you use that information and you do something,"
20:50;20:53;"you do your own thing and unofficially with the official thing."
20:53;20:56;"And in fact, I assume that hacks comes from like hacking, right?"
20:56;21:00;"Like computer hacking, which used to be some real outlaw type."
21:00;21:03;"I guess it still is. So the idea that one day McDonald's,"
21:03;21:09;"I'm just picturing some like seventies era, like hackers in Northern California."
21:09;21:15;"And if you showed them that in 50 years, there'd be a McDonald's would have official menu hacks."
21:15;21:21;"You know, it's just like a word that meant something deeply unofficial borderline, not okay."
21:21;21:26;"And anyway, McDonald's has these official menu hacks, which is it's manufactured descent."
21:26;21:31;"But anyway, then I see this thing where it says land air and see some like, wow, how does that work?"
21:31;21:35;"The sandwich would be so big because it has the two patties of the big Mac,"
21:35;21:38;"the McChicken, the filet of fish that to put it all together,"
21:38;21:41;"they would need a new kind of box to actually serve it."
21:41;21:43;"So, but I'm like, all right, that's interesting."
21:43;21:46;"And I guess I'm thinking about, I guess, well, you know, behind the scenes."
21:46;21:49;"Yeah, I guess they already have all the ingredients, right?"
21:49;21:53;"But then when I looked at the website, it said,"
21:53;22:00;"if you want to get this, the land air and see all you have to do is order the hack by name."
22:00;22:02;"Okay, I guess you pull up."
22:02;22:04;"Of course, you order anything by name."
22:04;22:08;"So you pull up and I guess you say, I'd like the land air and see."
22:08;22:12;"And then it seemed to imply, and this is what I can't get to the bottom of,"
22:12;22:15;"but the language made it sound like you order the land air and see,"
22:15;22:21;"and then you assemble the meal yourself, meaning that you have to buy each one individually."
22:21;22:23;"Wait, so then I just realized something."
22:23;22:27;"Basically, McDonald's is doing a promotion where they're saying for a limited time only,"
22:27;22:31;"you can order this menu hack, the land air and see."
22:31;22:37;"What that means is you pull up and you order a Big Mac, a McChicken and a filet of fish."
22:37;22:40;"We give it to you and then you mash it together."
22:40;22:44;"This can only be done for a limited time only."
22:44;22:46;"It's a special menu hack."
22:46;22:52;"And then you realize all you're doing is trying to convince people to buy two extra sandwiches"
22:52;22:54;"and make this big nasty thing."
22:54;22:55;"They don't even do it for you."
22:55;22:56;"Are you guys with me?"
22:56;22:58;"This is such a bizarre promotion."
22:58;22:59;"It makes no sense."
22:59;23:00;"I hate it."
23:01;23:05;"I mean, there was also, you know, a year or two ago, there was, you know,"
23:05;23:13;"all like the special meals, like a band, you know, built to spill would have the built to spill McDonald's meal."
23:13;23:14;"Yeah."
23:14;23:15;"Mountain Brews had one."
23:15;23:20;"Big Mac, no fries and a 12 pack of Corona."
23:20;23:22;"You have to eat in your car."
23:22;23:26;"At least for the Mountain Brews one, McDonald's did have to actually buy the Corona, have that on site."
23:26;23:32;"For the BTS one or the Travis Scott, all they were doing is just giving you things they already had."
23:32;23:34;"But how does this even work?"
23:34;23:40;"Okay, so in a month when the special is gone, someone goes in and says,"
23:40;23:45;"""Yeah, I'll have a Big Mac, a chicken sandwich and a filet of fish."""
23:45;23:48;"And you go, ""Uh-uh, I think I know what you're going to do."""
23:48;23:49;"Yeah, I think they'd call the cops."
23:49;23:50;"It's insane."
23:50;23:51;"Wait, wait, hold on."
23:51;23:55;"Sir, are you trying to order a Landair and see that promotion is over?"
23:55;23:58;"No, no, all I wanted was a Big Mac, a McChicken and a filet of fish."
23:58;24:03;"And they say, ""All right, well, that's fine, but you're going to have to sign a sworn affidavit saying"
24:03;24:08;"you will not combine them into one sandwich afterwards because that promotion is over."""
24:08;24:11;"It's a promotion, but you have to do the work yourself."
24:11;24:14;"And by the way, that's not the only thing on this menu."
24:14;24:21;"There's also the hash brown McMuffin, which is a sausage McMuffin with egg and then a hash brown."
24:21;24:22;"And guess what you do?"
24:22;24:25;"You put the hash brown on the sausage McMuffin with egg."
24:25;24:29;"That one's so simple, there must be thousands of people who do that every day."
24:29;24:33;"And they're pretending that this is for a limited time only."
24:33;24:35;"I feel like I've got to be missing something."
24:35;24:37;"Seinfeld, have you crunched any numbers on this?"
24:37;24:39;"Is there any more info?"
24:39;24:41;"Oh, I think we just lost Seinfeld."
24:41;24:43;"Oh, Seinfeld won't come back."
24:43;24:45;"I don't see anything about it being a limited time."
24:45;24:47;"I think I saw that on the website."
24:47;24:50;"Menu hacks, order by name and build by hand."
24:50;24:52;"Build by hand."
24:52;24:55;"Order by name, build by hand."
24:55;24:59;"Oh, and by the way, our producer, Matt, maybe the promotion's over, we don't know,"
24:59;25:04;"but he was just doing a little bit of research and he ate at McDonald's and he tried to order a menu hack."
25:04;25:06;"They had no idea what he was talking about."
25:06;25:15;"Which I have to say is like, obviously, famously, In-N-Out Burger, California, Famous Fast Food has a secret menu."
25:15;25:16;"Sure."
25:16;25:18;"The Animal Salad."
25:18;25:24;"There is something as a patron when you go in, there's always a, it's nerve wracking."
25:24;25:29;"Like if I order this, are they going to understand what the f*** I'm talking about?"
25:29;25:30;"Oh, it's embarrassing."
25:30;25:32;"It's embarrassing."
25:32;25:34;"And so now here's one where they don't even give it to you."
25:34;25:38;"How about this McDonald's, how about a class action lawsuit from people with social anxiety?"
25:38;25:40;"You ever think about that?"
25:40;25:42;"Matt, was it embarrassing?"
25:42;25:44;"Yeah, absolutely."
25:44;25:49;"I just ordered the individual items and like shut up real quick."
25:49;25:51;"I mean, could you imagine?"
25:51;25:53;"Hold on, hold on."
25:53;25:56;"Did you specifically say to hi, I'll have the land air and sea?"
25:56;26:02;"I ordered the crunchy double, which is a six piece chicken nugget and a double cheeseburger"
26:02;26:04;"and that was the only thing I could justify eating for lunch."
26:04;26:08;"You'd put the nuggets and the barbecue sauce on the double cheeseburger."
26:08;26:09;"Yes."
26:09;26:11;"You said, hello, I'll have a crunchy double."
26:11;26:13;"And they said, excuse me?"
26:13;26:16;"The lady like went silent for about 10 seconds and said, what can I get you?"
26:16;26:19;"Like she just kind of ignored me."
26:19;26:21;"This is not Taco Bell."
26:21;26:22;"Yeah, basically."
26:22;26:24;"This is a nightmare."
26:24;26:25;"So embarrassing."
26:25;26:27;"I'm sorry, Matt."
26:27;26:29;"All good."
26:29;26:31;"It led to a good segment here."
27:30;27:34;"The idea that you would have to go and say, I would like, what was it called, Matt?"
27:34;27:36;"He got the crunchy double."
27:36;27:37;"I like the crunchy double."
27:37;27:40;"And they say, what are you talking about?"
27:40;27:42;"And then you have to ask again."
27:42;27:44;"And they'll be like, we don't know what you're talking about."
27:44;27:45;"This is McDonald's."
27:45;27:46;"Everything's on the menu."
27:46;27:47;"You see it."
27:47;27:51;"And you go, well, I would like to order a burger and chicken nuggets."
27:51;27:55;"And I'm going to put the chicken nuggets onto the burger."
27:55;28:00;"The idea of it, it sounds like you're psychotic."
28:00;28:02;"Yeah, no, I imagine."
28:02;28:06;"Yeah, you said, I'm going to put the chicken McNuggets and the barbecue sauce"
28:06;28:10;"on the burger, and I'm going to eat it all as one giant chicken cheeseburger."
28:10;28:13;"And then they said, sir, we don't do that."
28:13;28:16;"You can order the six-piece chicken McNuggets and the cheeseburger,"
28:16;28:18;"but we're not going to put it-- no, no, no."
28:18;28:19;"I know that."
28:19;28:21;"I didn't say you were going to put it together."
28:21;28:22;"I'm going to."
28:22;28:25;"After I buy it, that's what I'm going to do."
28:25;28:28;"She's like, you're free to do what you want with it."
28:28;28:30;"And actually, wait, hold on, hold on."
28:30;28:34;"I'm not going to put all six McNuggets on the cheeseburger."
28:34;28:35;"You ready for this?"
28:35;28:37;"I'm going to take one off."
28:37;28:39;"I'm just going to throw it in the garbage."
28:39;28:41;"How about that?"
28:41;28:44;"Sir, you can do what you want with the food."
28:44;28:46;"Sir, all items are a la carte."
28:46;28:50;"You can order by name and build by hand."
28:50;28:54;"And whatever you're buying for the food, we don't give a [BLEEP]"
28:54;28:58;"Wouldn't that be cool if that became McDonald's new slogan?"
28:58;29:00;"Order by name, build by hand."
29:02;29:05;"You will order by name, you will build by hand."
29:05;29:08;"It's a very Daniel Plainview."
29:08;29:11;"Yeah, very."
29:11;29:12;"Cool."
29:12;29:13;"I got a new hack."
29:13;29:15;"This one's called Ocean Citrus."
29:15;29:16;"Sounds good."
29:16;29:19;"You get a fillet of fish and a large sprite."
29:19;29:21;"You dump the sprite on the fillet of fish."
29:21;29:23;"It's kind of like a sloppy steak."
29:23;29:26;"You get it real nice and wet, and then you eat it."
29:26;29:29;"Could you dunk the fillet of fish in the sprite?"
29:29;29:30;"Oh, yeah, you could dunk it."
29:30;29:31;"Would that work too?"
29:31;29:32;"Yeah, that works too."
29:32;29:34;"Yeah, actually, that's probably a better idea."
29:34;29:36;"You dunk it, it's going to be less messy."
29:36;29:40;"But when you get to the drive-thru, you have to tell the person you're going to do it."
29:40;29:41;"That's a big part of it."
29:41;29:43;"I'm getting the Ocean Citrus."
29:43;29:45;"I don't know what that is, sir."
29:45;29:47;"I thought you might not."
29:47;29:48;"Here's what it is."
29:48;29:49;"It's a fillet of fish and a sprite."
29:49;29:51;"Okay, that'll be-- no, hold on."
29:51;29:53;"I want you to know."
29:53;29:54;"It's so perverted."
29:54;29:56;"I want you to know what I'm going to do with this food."
29:56;30:00;"I'm going to recombine it in ways you wouldn't believe."
30:00;30:05;"It's like a weird outtake from the movie Zodiac."
30:05;30:09;"The Zodiac killer is in the drive-thru."
30:09;30:12;"He orders that, and he's like, ""I'm ordering by name."
30:12;30:13;"I'm building by hand."""
30:13;30:15;"""I'm building by hand."""
30:15;30:17;"Ocean Citrus."
30:17;30:19;"I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do."
30:19;30:21;"Please, sir."
30:21;30:23;"Keep it moving."
30:23;30:25;"We got a little more info."
30:25;30:27;"Each menu hack was fan-inspired."
30:27;30:35;"Jennifer Heaven, Vice President of U.S. Marketing, Brand Content and Engagement for McDonald's, said,"
30:35;30:43;"""From hip-hop icons to Christmas queens, everyone has a unique go-to McDonald's order, including our everyday customers."""
30:43;30:47;"It's so weird to me that they're hyping up--"
30:47;30:51;"Maybe McDonald's was starting to be seen as, like, so boring,"
30:51;30:57;"and it doesn't fit in with this post-social media, building-your-own-brand thing."
30:57;31:02;"Maybe McDonald's did some market research, and they said, like,"
31:02;31:08;"""In the '90s, yeah, it was amazing that you had seven things on the extra-value meal to order, but that's not enough."
31:08;31:11;"For Gen Z, seven choices isn't enough."
31:11;31:14;"You need your own unique order."""
31:14;31:16;"And McDonald's, like, got it in their heads that they were just like,"
31:16;31:22;"""Okay, we really have to hype people up that everybody can come to McDonald's and get their own unique order."""
31:22;31:24;"Like, McDonald's is one of, like, the--"
31:24;31:27;"I don't know. It's not like some, like, random-ass diner."
31:27;31:32;"McDonald's, probably 90% of people order very similar things."
31:32;31:35;"They seem so interested in hyping up this idea that,"
31:35;31:37;"""At McDonald's, you can be yourself."""
31:37;31:38;"Oh my God, yeah."
31:38;31:40;"We get people who order Big Mac with fries."
31:40;31:43;"We get people who order Big Mac with chicken nuggets."
31:43;31:45;"We get people who order just chicken nuggets."
31:45;31:47;"I mean, you can be yourself here."
31:47;31:52;"Yeah, this strikes me as an issue of, like, people in the marketing department staring at each other,"
31:52;31:56;"being like, ""How do we switch this up? What do we--?"""
31:56;31:59;"Basically, looking for solutions where there isn't really a problem."
31:59;32:04;"McDonald's is, like, selling burgers and chicken nuggets and Cokes."
32:04;32:08;"It reminds me a little bit of, like, IHOP, when IHOP had, like, an identity crisis."
32:08;32:09;"Oh, yeah, IHOP."
32:09;32:12;"And it was like, ""Look, there's already enough people selling burgers."
32:12;32:15;"I mean, you guys want to be International House of Burgers?"
32:15;32:19;"Knock yourself out, but, like, get in line."""
32:19;32:23;"Maybe what it is is, you know how people don't want to work at McDonald's fast food anymore?"
32:23;32:25;"This great resignation."
32:25;32:30;"Maybe this is, like, the first step towards, like, make your own just normal menu items."
32:30;32:32;"Like, we'll give you the bun."
32:32;32:35;"You know what I mean? It's a way to take the labor."
32:35;32:37;"And this is just easing into that, right?"
32:37;32:39;"We'll give you the frozen fries. You take it home."
32:39;32:43;"The global elite is prepping us for ""Build your own McDonald's."""
32:43;32:47;"This campaign shows that it has never been our menu."
32:47;32:50;"The menu belongs to our fans."
32:50;32:52;"- Not true. - Our fans."
32:52;32:56;"Also, it's so funny, like, God, this really is some post-social media nightmare stuff."
32:56;32:58;"That, like, now McDonald's has fans."
32:58;33:00;"Used to be customers or patrons."
33:00;33:03;"Now it really-- McDonald's wants to be BTS."
33:03;33:06;"This one's for the fans. Fan culture."
33:06;33:08;"I do this for the fans."
33:08;33:11;"And also, what do you mean? It shows it has never been our menu."
33:11;33:13;"The menu belongs to our fans."
33:13;33:16;"We're excited to celebrate them in a bigger way than ever before"
33:16;33:21;"by putting their delicious hacks, as seen on social media, on our menus."
33:21;33:25;"I personally can't wait for our fans to try my favorite hack,"
33:25;33:27;"the hash brown McMuffin."
33:27;33:31;"And then IYKYK, which if you know, you know."
33:31;33:34;"So already, they didn't put anything on the menu."
33:34;33:40;"All they did was share the personal knowledge of some of their fans"
33:40;33:43;"to the whole world, which I guess is fine,"
33:43;33:45;"but they didn't put anything on the menu."
33:45;33:50;"There are examples in history of fans or customers or somebody being like,"
33:50;33:54;"you know, going into a store, I think, and just being like,"
33:54;33:56;"""I always buy those two things together."""
33:56;33:58;"I don't know, like an Arnold Palmer."
33:58;34:01;"Like Arnold Palmer, he liked to mix up lemonade and iced tea,"
34:01;34:04;"and one day somebody said, ""You know what?"
34:04;34:07;"In tribute to Arnold Palmer, we're going to make that a drink"
34:07;34:09;"that you can just order."""
34:09;34:10;"Great drink."
34:10;34:12;"And it's not like when you order an Arnold Palmer,"
34:12;34:16;"they don't bring you a cup of lemonade and a cup of iced tea."
34:16;34:18;"That's what McDonald's is doing."
34:18;34:21;"And imagine if they did that, that would be disrespectful to Arnold Palmer."
34:21;34:23;"I don't know if you recall, a few months ago,"
34:23;34:25;"I hit McDonald's for the first time in a long time."
34:25;34:26;"Oh, yeah."
34:26;34:28;"I didn't know what was even on the menu."
34:28;34:30;"I just asked if they had an Arnold Palmer,"
34:30;34:32;"and the guy was like, ""I'll make you one."""
34:32;34:33;"That's a hack."
34:33;34:35;"You did tell me that. I forgot about it, though."
34:35;34:38;"Great service at that Yucca Valley McDonald's."
34:38;34:41;"You should go back there and see if they'll do any of these hacks."
34:41;34:42;"That'd be cool."
34:42;34:44;"I just wish they-- you know what?"
34:44;34:45;"I'm being hard on McDonald's."
34:45;34:47;"I just wish they phrased it a little differently."
34:47;34:50;"If they just said, ""Hey, guys, we're amplifying"
34:50;34:54;"some of our fans' favorite hacks, and we encourage you to do the same."
34:54;34:56;"This is a cool thing to do."""
34:56;34:58;"Like if they just said, ""There's a lot of stuff on our menu"
34:58;35:00;"that you may never have thought to combine."
35:00;35:02;"Here's some fun things you can do,"""
35:02;35:06;"versus this bizarre idea that now it's on our menu."
35:06;35:09;"It was always on your menu, and it will always be on your menu."
35:09;35:11;"But if you order it by any specific name,"
35:11;35:14;"no one will know what the f*** you're talking about."
35:14;35:16;"It's an absolute clusterf***,"
35:16;35:19;"and a lot of people with social anxiety"
35:19;35:23;"were put in very difficult situations due to this promotion."
35:23;35:24;"Very confusing."
35:57;36:00;"So anyway, that's what's going on over at McDonald's."
36:00;36:02;"I think I want to go to Folgers next,"
36:02;36:06;"because there's another rebranding happening."
36:06;36:10;"So Folgers is currently the leading ground coffee brand"
36:10;36:14;"in the United States with over $1 billion in sales."
36:14;36:16;"Starbucks was second with $502 million."
36:16;36:18;"I'm surprised by that."
36:18;36:22;"So Starbucks is pulling in $502 million just of ground coffee."
36:22;36:23;"That's pretty good."
36:23;36:26;"That's only a small part of their business."
36:26;36:30;"But I came across a tweet from Folgers,"
36:30;36:33;"like a lot of corporate-promoted tweets."
36:33;36:37;"It wasn't getting a ton of pickup, but it said--"
36:37;36:38;"[laughs]"
36:38;36:39;"Pretty quiet."
36:39;36:41;"Wait, does anybody have it on deck?"
36:41;36:43;"I totally missed this part of the thread."
36:43;36:47;"By the time that I saw this whole Folgers drama on the thread,"
36:47;36:49;"on the TC thread, I just was--"
36:49;36:50;"Too many texts deep."
36:50;36:52;"Things that I already moved on."
36:52;36:54;"I'm excited to learn about this."
36:54;36:57;"Yeah, there's some big things happening in the Folgers world."
36:57;37:01;"So from verified Folgers,"
37:01;37:04;"over 20 damn good varieties of coffee,"
37:04;37:06;"and every last one's a hit."
37:06;37:08;"And then they shared a little video."
37:08;37:11;"And they shared a little video, which we can watch now,"
37:11;37:15;"which is someone opening up a Folgers,"
37:15;37:18;"and it shows the history of Folgers through their packaging."
37:18;37:21;"Okay, but before we get to that, so just to start,"
37:21;37:24;"they said we have, what, 20 damn varieties?"
37:24;37:29;"Over 20 damn good varieties of coffee, and every last one's a hit."
37:29;37:31;"Oh, yeah, yeah. So that was interesting to me."
37:31;37:33;"So already there's something funny, like,"
37:33;37:34;"obviously there's some debate."
37:34;37:37;"Is damn really a curse word?"
37:37;37:38;"It's certainly--"
37:38;37:40;"It's strong language."
37:40;37:41;"It's strong language."
37:41;37:44;"It's not something you would see in a New York Times headline."
37:44;37:46;"And certainly it's considered a curse word"
37:46;37:50;"by the more conservative members of our community."
37:50;37:53;"So anyway, there's already something funny about, like, Folgers,"
37:53;37:56;"which historically has been known for some of the most, like,"
37:56;38:00;"saccharine, sweet commercials ever."
38:00;38:04;"♪ The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup ♪"
38:04;38:09;"And Folgers has definitely historically been, like, a family brand."
38:09;38:12;"And so for them to use the word damn was kind of surprising."
38:12;38:16;"I mean, my first thought when I see damn good coffee,"
38:16;38:18;"I think of Twin Peaks, right?"
38:18;38:21;"Because the Kyle MacLachlan character was always talking about damn good coffee."
38:21;38:25;"But, you know, even that's like Folgers referencing Twin Peaks."
38:25;38:26;"It's like, okay."
38:26;38:31;"I mean, Folgers is like a very just, like, tried and true, uncool brand."
38:31;38:34;"And a lot of the comments below were people being like,"
38:34;38:37;"""Whoa, language,"" or like, ""Hey, guys, quit trying to be edgy."""
38:37;38:40;"So, you know, the damn really stuck out to people."
38:40;38:45;"And it goes even deeper because apparently they were trying to get, like,"
38:45;38:50;"a hashtag going that said, like, #DamnRightIt'sFolgers."
38:50;38:54;"Like, clearly there was a decision made that damn was, like,"
38:54;38:55;"the new buzzword for Folgers."
38:55;38:58;"I could actually picture, like, the Don Draper pitch where, like,"
38:58;39:01;"all the old school Folgers executives are there and he just, like,"
39:01;39:05;"unveils a big poster just in big font just says damn."
39:05;39:07;"They're like, ""Whoa, what is this?"""
39:07;39:10;"And he's like, ""This is the word that's going to save your ass."
39:10;39:12;"Damn."""
39:12;39:15;"I mean, they're trying to get Kendrick Lamar involved, but..."
39:15;39:16;"Yeah."
39:16;39:19;"He keeps turning them down."
39:19;39:21;"Kendrick doesn't drink Folgers."
39:21;39:22;"He's a Starbucks guy."
39:22;39:24;"I got, I got, I got, I got"
39:24;39:27;"Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA"
39:27;39:30;"Quarter peace, got war and peace inside my DNA"
39:30;39:34;"I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA"
39:34;39:37;"I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA"
39:37;39:39;"I was born like this, and spawned like this"
39:39;39:42;"Immaculate conception, I transform like this, perform like this"
39:42;39:45;"What's y'all's? You a new weapon I don't contemplate"
39:45;39:47;"I meditate, then off your, off your head"
39:47;39:49;"This that put the kids to bed"
39:49;39:51;"This that I got, I got, I got, I got"
39:51;39:54;"Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA"
39:54;39:58;"I got millions, I got riches building in my DNA"
39:58;40:01;"I got dog, I got evil that rot inside my DNA"
40:01;40:04;"I got off, I got trouble, some heart inside my DNA"
40:04;40:08;"I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon I serve"
40:08;40:11;"Yeah, that's him again, the sound, the engine in this like a bird"
40:11;40:15;"You see fireworks, they cover tires, skirt the boulevard"
40:15;40:17;"I know how you work, I know just who you are"
40:17;40:19;"See, use it, use it, use it"
40:19;40:22;"So let's play the ad, because it goes deeper than this."
40:22;40:24;"They really, they made a decision."
40:24;40:26;"We're gonna start using the word ""damn"" frequently,"
40:26;40:30;"and also, we're gonna like, be kind of punk rock and shake things up."
40:38;40:41;"I don't give a damn about my reputation"
40:43;40:46;"You're living in the past, it's a new generation"
40:47;40:50;"The commercial opened with kind of like a classic Folgers scene,"
40:50;40:52;"and then basically, ""Rrrr, Joan Jett."""
40:52;40:55;"I don't give a damn about my bad reputation"
40:55;40:58;"So they pick a song that has ""damn"" in the lyrics."
41:05;41:07;"Is this song 40 years old?"
41:07;41:09;"Yeah, I think this song is 40 years old."
41:16;41:19;"One, two, ready, ready!"
41:19;41:23;"And then Trombone Shorty comes in and does a version of ""Bad Reputation."""
41:23;41:25;"So there's a lot going on,"
41:25;41:29;"but they're trying to use the Joan Jett song in a surprising way,"
41:29;41:33;"where it's like, ""Oh, you thought this was gonna be like some heartfelt Folgers commercial?"""
41:33;41:34;"No."
41:34;41:37;"We don't give a damn about our bad reputation."
41:37;41:40;"It's like Folgers doesn't have a bad reputation, but they're trying to like--"
41:40;41:42;"Well, the coffee's terrible."
41:42;41:43;"[Laughter]"
41:43;41:46;"They have a terrible reputation for people that actually care about--"
41:46;41:49;"If you care even a little bit about coffee,"
41:49;41:51;"Folgers is truly the pits."
41:51;41:53;"Lousy, lousy product."
41:53;41:55;"Maybe that's what they're going for."
41:55;41:56;"We don't give a damn."
41:56;41:58;"I mean, they're screwed,"
41:58;42:01;"because the people buying Folgers are like, yeah, like aging boomers"
42:01;42:04;"who've been drinking Folgers for like 50 years."
42:04;42:08;"They're looking at the timeline on their accounting sheet,"
42:08;42:10;"and they're getting nervous."
42:10;42:11;"Right."
42:11;42:12;"Is the bottom about to fall out?"
42:12;42:14;"Is there a Folgers whole bean product?"
42:14;42:21;"Can you buy like Ethiopian Sumatra blend whole bean Folgers?"
42:21;42:24;"Like probably, but I bet maybe not."
42:24;42:26;"I don't think so."
42:26;42:27;"Yeah, everything about this--"
42:27;42:29;"So Folgers has this whole thing."
42:29;42:32;"They also say, ""Allow us to reintroduce ourselves."""
42:32;42:35;"Yeah, so clearly there must have been a panic"
42:35;42:38;"that something different had to happen."
42:38;42:40;"Here's an article on thedrum.com."
42:40;42:42;"""Like a hot cup of coffee in a mid-afternoon slump,"
42:42;42:46;"Folgers is hoping that a fresh dose of branding"
42:46;42:48;"will bring a burst of energy to its public image."
42:48;42:52;"The 172-year-old coffee brand is pushing back"
42:52;42:54;"against the popular, unflattering image"
42:54;42:56;"of being your grandma's coffee"

43:10;43:12;"That's also a Jay-Z lyric,"
43:12;43:15;"""Allow me to reintroduce myself,"" from the Black Album."
43:15;43:17;"Right, yeah, classic."
43:17;43:20;"I asked Jay if they could license that song,"
43:20;43:22;"and he turned them down."
43:22;43:24;"Yeah, I don't see him saying yes to that."
43:24;43:27;"Folgers reaching out to hip-hop luminaries"
43:27;43:31;"and just getting shut down one after another."
43:31;43:35;"Folgers, the official coffee of trap music."
43:35;43:37;"[laughter]"
43:37;43:40;"Folgers, the official ground coffee of hyper-pop."
43:40;43:44;"We're not your grandma's coffee."
43:44;43:47;"See, it's funny, you talk about McDonald's"
43:47;43:51;"having this weird need to reinvent the wheel."

45:02;45:05;"But interestingly, and I give them credit for this,"
45:05;45:07;"'cause obviously they hooked me."
45:07;45:09;"They caught my attention with the damn thing."

45:19;45:22;"Okay. I expect a report next episode."

45:25;45:28;"I just got a call out. There's a Folgers/Manson connection."

46:01;46:04;"God, they could actually do that in this, like..."
46:04;46:07;"really fight the power way."
46:07;46:10;"Like, for too long, you know, we lost one of our own."
46:10;46:12;"This time it's personal."
46:12;46:15;"I mean, Tom O'Neill went into the red right in that book."
46:15;46:17;"This is the way he can make his money back,"

46:27;46:30;"Okay, but here's the other thing that I found interesting about this."
46:30;46:32;"So I was going deep on the Folgers website,"
46:32;46:34;"checking out their kind of rebranding,"
46:34;46:36;"and yeah, I get it."
46:36;46:38;"And by the way, if I really take a step back,"
46:38;46:41;"I do find Folgers introducing the word ""damn"""

46:45;46:47;"I feel like if we were brainstorming for Folgers,"
46:47;46:49;"we actually might come up with an idea like that."
46:49;46:51;"Like, don't go crazy."
46:51;46:53;"Just start saying ""damn"" a lot."
46:53;46:55;"You know, just like an angry old man."
46:55;46:57;"They can't go full, you know,"
46:57;46:59;"the idea we pitched Dunkin' Donuts back in the day was,"
46:59;47:00;"""It's f***ing Dunkin'."""
47:00;47:03;"You know, because Dunkin' Donuts is a little more hardcore."
47:03;47:07;"Yeah, Massachusetts, it's the official coffee of mass holes."
47:07;47:09;"Kind of angry East Coast people."
47:09;47:12;"But Folgers is more like, ""F***, damn it, where's the Folgers?"""
47:12;47:13;"I could see that."
47:13;47:16;"Just like they hire an old man to say, ""F***, damn it, where's the Folgers?"""
47:16;47:18;"So I do find it charming."
47:18;47:21;"But there's this other element that I noticed on the website."
47:21;47:25;"They go on and on about their connection to New Orleans."
47:25;47:28;"And this, I'm curious what you guys think about this."
47:28;47:37;"So Folgers has a really big roasting plant in New Orleans."
47:37;47:41;"I don't know if it's the only place they have a roastery."
47:41;47:42;"I did some research."
47:42;47:45;"I think at some point they had one in Oklahoma."
47:45;47:50;"But there's definitely maybe the biggest in the U.S."
47:50;47:53;"Now, of course, coffee is not grown in the U.S."
47:53;47:56;"So who knows where they're getting the coffee from."
47:56;48:01;"I know there's a lot of bad vibes around the global coffee trade."
48:01;48:04;"Like a lot of things that come from other parts of the world."
48:04;48:07;"But whatever. I don't have any reason to think Folgers is doing anything shady."
48:07;48:10;"But here's the thing. It's roasted in New Orleans."
48:10;48:13;"And on the website, I've got to find it."
48:13;48:15;"It's not FolgersCoffee.com."
48:15;48:20;"It's like a special website that they made that was kind of tied in to the new campaign."
48:20;48:25;"And in it, after they're talking about, ""We're reintroducing ourselves,"""
48:25;48:32;"they make this whole thing about how, ""We're so proud of all our employees in New Orleans."""
48:32;48:36;"And they repeatedly refer to New Orleans as ""our hometown."""
48:36;48:39;"""We're so proud of our hometown, New Orleans."""
48:39;48:41;"""We donate money."""
48:41;48:45;"""We were one of the first places to reopen after the hurricane."""
48:45;48:48;"So then I started to think, because I didn't know that much about Folgers."
48:48;48:52;"And I said, ""Oh, is Folgers a New Orleans-based company?"""
48:52;48:55;"And then, the history is actually very interesting."
48:55;48:57;"But no, it's not a New Orleans-based company."
48:57;49:03;"It was founded in 1850 in San Francisco as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills."
49:03;49:06;"It was founded by William H. Bovey,"
49:06;49:10;"who saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing."
49:10;49:15;"Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans and roast and grind them on their own."
49:15;49:17;"That sounds like a huge pain in the ass."
49:17;49:21;"Bovey hired James Folger, a carpenter, to build the mill."
49:21;49:24;"Folger was originally from Nantucket,"
49:24;49:28;"but moved to San Francisco along with his two brothers during the Gold Rush."
49:28;49:31;"So this is interesting to me, because you think about Gold Rush companies,"
49:31;49:33;"they always talk about Levi's,"
49:33;49:36;"because Levi Strauss was an enterprising guy,"
49:36;49:40;"he was like a 49er, came out here to California,"
49:40;49:43;"and starts making these jeans that people can wear when they're mining gold."
49:43;49:47;"You don't think of Folgers as a company that was founded during the Gold Rush."
49:47;49:53;"But the story is that Folger and his two brothers left Nantucket after a fire destroyed their family home."
49:53;49:56;"And I guess also things were getting tough in Nantucket because"
49:56;50:01;"people weren't using whale oil anymore to light their lamps."
50:01;50:04;"So, you know, the whole story of Folgers is getting kind of interesting."
50:04;50:06;"It's like, these guys from Nantucket,"
50:06;50:09;"the whaling industry gets all messed up,"
50:09;50:11;"they decide to move out to the Gold Rush, they build a mill,"
50:11;50:14;"blah blah blah, the Folgers buy out the original founder,"
50:14;50:17;"next thing you know it's this giant company."
50:17;50:24;"And in 1960, as shipping routes from Central America shifted to New Orleans,"
50:24;50:27;"making the city one of the largest green coffee markets in the United States,"
50:27;50:31;"they built their largest plant in New Orleans, which is where they still roast."
50:31;50:34;"Now, Procter & Gamble,"
50:34;50:38;"oh no, sorry, then Procter & Gamble bought Folgers in 1963,"
50:38;50:42;"and now in 2008, the Jam Smucker Company owns Folgers."
50:42;50:44;"Now I can be the change that I want to see."
50:44;50:47;"I can heal the world for real if I'm speaking honestly."
50:47;50:52;"Nat Turner in my past life, Bob Marley in my last life, back again."
50:52;50:56;"Look into the eyes of a young who survived against all the odds."
50:56;50:59;"Look into the eyes of a young who's surprised to be alive."
50:59;51:02;"I died five years ago, the game snatched a spirit, yo."
51:02;51:05;"My resurrection was a miracle, 'cause still I rise."
51:05;51:07;"It's ill-advised to bet against 'em."
51:07;51:09;"Raised in hell, but heaven's system, let 'em diss 'em."
51:09;51:12;"Can't handle the truth, don't know they slaves."
51:12;51:14;"I forgive 'em 'cause I know they wage."
51:14;51:17;"They see a black man shine, first thing they do is throw they shade."
51:17;51:22;"Word, I swerve like a thunderbird on the curb with a copper saw, and I'm not just doing it."
51:22;51:24;"Hate like if I make it in the spot for you in it."
51:24;51:26;"Had to say the rap gang 'cause I watched 'em ruin it."
51:26;51:28;"So you can take my [ ] and chew on it."
51:28;51:30;"Tucker, I'm a blockbuster, motion picture."
51:30;51:35;"Flows consist of poking scriptures, known to rip a hole through the soul called dopest."
51:35;51:37;"Snatch a soul and pose for pictures holding it."
51:37;51:39;"Revenge of the dreamer, soul vindictive."
51:39;51:41;"Back from Moe, that wax is over with."
51:41;51:43;"For you, sleeping is his foe, just crystals."
51:43;51:45;"Wow, in the form of a loaded pistol."
51:45;51:47;"Bullets root, they don't even say hello, just kiss you."
51:47;51:49;"Blah, burning hell with a coat that fits you."
51:49;51:52;"When you see the devil, you can tell him, ""Cold just sent you."""
51:52;51:53;"Now."
51:53;51:56;"It sounds like they do have a real connection to New Orleans, mostly out of convenience."
51:56;52:01;"They built a giant roastery there because that's where all the green coffee beans come in."
52:01;52:04;"I guess there must be other roasteries in New Orleans."
52:04;52:08;"The thing that irked me a little bit, and I'm just curious what you guys think."
52:08;52:15;"Can Folgers call New Orleans our hometown based on this history and the fact that they're owned by the James Smucker Company?"
52:15;52:18;"Is that disingenuous to say New Orleans is our hometown?"
52:18;52:19;"Thoughts?"
52:19;52:20;"I'm voting yes."
52:20;52:23;"They can call it their hometown because they're based there."
52:23;52:25;"They got roots in the city."
52:25;52:28;"If I move to another city, that's my hometown."
52:28;52:32;"If that's where they're employing people, that's their hometown."
52:32;52:33;"That's where their roastery is."
52:33;52:36;"They're probably employing people all over the world."
52:36;52:38;"The corporate office is not in New Orleans."
52:38;52:40;"You think they're paying corporate taxes in Louisiana?"
52:40;52:44;"I mean, if that were the case, no, they're probably paying Delaware taxes."
52:44;52:46;"They probably set up their office in Delaware."
52:46;52:47;"They're probably paying no taxes."
52:47;52:48;"Wait, wait, wait."
52:48;52:52;"Seinfeld, where's the James Smucker Company based?"
52:52;52:55;"James Smucker is based in Oroville, Ohio."
52:55;52:57;"It's headquartered in Oroville, Ohio."
52:57;52:59;"Founded 125 years ago."
52:59;53:06;"Quick number crunch on those Ohio corporate tax rates."
53:06;53:09;"This is where people get off the corporate food history trend."
53:09;53:12;"They've been there for 62 years at this point."
53:12;53:14;"But it's just their roastery."
53:14;53:16;"That's the thing that I just wonder about."
53:16;53:17;"Well, what else?"
53:17;53:21;"I mean, that's like the bulk of the labor that has to happen."
53:21;53:26;"Ohio, I do need to say, as I expected, Ohio has no corporate tax."
53:26;53:27;"Okay."
53:27;53:28;"None."
53:28;53:31;"That's why TC Inc. is located there."
53:31;53:32;"True."
53:32;53:36;"I think it begs the question, can one person have multiple hometowns?"
53:36;53:39;"Or is hometown a singular thing?"
53:39;53:41;"No, I think that's a good--"
53:41;53:44;"I love the idea that they're like, ""Oh, New Orleans is our hometown."""
53:44;53:47;"But then when the IRS is calling, they're like, ""Whoa."""
53:47;53:49;"[laughter]"
53:49;53:50;"No, sir."
53:51;53:53;"Yeah, maybe I'm being harsh."
53:53;53:59;"And then I was looking it up, you can go take a tour of the roasting plant"
53:59;54:02;"when you're down in New Orleans, which I definitely will do next time I'm in New Orleans."
54:02;54:04;"So maybe I'm being too hard."
54:04;54:08;"Maybe somebody who's actually from there, if you ask them,"
54:08;54:11;"""Do you feel like Folgers is like a New Orleans company?"""
54:11;54:13;"They'd be like, ""Oh, hell yeah."""
54:13;54:16;"Everybody knows somebody who worked at the Folgers plant."
54:16;54:20;"We smell that mediocre coffee all over the city."
54:20;54:24;"If you're from New Orleans, I'll never catch you drinking Maxwell House"
54:24;54:26;"because we're a Folgers town."
54:26;54:27;"Absolutely."
54:27;54:29;"It's like Detroit with the American cars."
54:29;54:31;"Maybe. It's possible."
54:31;54:34;"And maybe-- I just had this feeling where I'm like,"
54:34;54:38;"New Orleans is a very cool and also neutral town."
54:38;54:42;"Red state and blue state people all like New Orleans."
54:42;54:46;"If they can't rep San Francisco, that's way too blue state."
54:46;54:48;"And also maybe Ohio."
54:48;54:53;"They don't think that has that kind of American heritage that New Orleans has."
54:53;54:55;"But I just kind of felt like, I don't know."
54:55;55:00;"Ohio doesn't have a culinary tradition in the way that New Orleans would."
55:00;55:03;"Yeah, I just felt like they were playing that a little bit hard"
55:03;55:05;"by calling it our hometown."
55:05;55:08;"I think if they could say, ""Spotlight on our roastery,"""
55:08;55:10;"I guess I have a lot of questions, which is,"
55:10;55:12;"""Is this the only roastery?"
55:12;55:15;"What percentage of Folgers employees work there?"""
55:15;55:18;"Because it's possible that they have many employees"
55:18;55:21;"that also just work in wherever they get the beans from"
55:21;55:23;"and certainly in corporate."
55:23;55:25;"I guess I just kind of felt like if--"
55:25;55:27;"Okay, for instance, there's a Fender--"
55:27;55:30;"famously a Fender guitar factory in Mexico."
55:30;55:32;"Or at least there was."
55:32;55:34;"People would always talk about with guitars--"
55:34;55:36;"See, I'm bringing it back to music."
55:36;55:39;"When I got my first guitar was a Mexican Strat."
55:39;55:40;"Dude, same here."
55:40;55:42;"Oh, really? Also Mexican Strat?"
55:42;55:45;"I started playing it, and I had a little Fender Bullet amp."
55:45;55:47;"And I remember going to school."
55:47;55:50;"Some of the richer kids, when I told them I got a Strat,"
55:50;55:52;"the first thing they said, ""American?"""
55:52;55:54;"I said, ""Uh, I don't know."""
55:54;55:56;"They're like, ""Well, look at the back."""
55:56;55:58;"I said, ""Well, it says 'Made in Mexico.'"""
55:58;56:00;"""Oh, okay, dude. Mine's American."""
56:00;56:02;"I had the exact conversations."
56:02;56:05;"And I said, ""You know what? F--- you. I love my Mexican Strat."""
56:05;56:07;"Can I ask you guys a question?"
56:07;56:08;"Yeah."
56:08;56:11;"What do you respectively consider your hometown?"
56:11;56:12;"Jersey."
56:12;56:14;"No question about it, because to me,"
56:14;56:17;"your hometown is where you came of age."
56:17;56:19;"I was born in Manhattan."
56:19;56:21;"I lived there quite a bit of my adult life,"
56:21;56:24;"so I have a very deep connection to New York."
56:24;56:27;"But in this really big-picture family way,"
56:27;56:29;"when I think of just my hometown,"
56:29;56:32;"it's where I went to high school."
56:32;56:35;"So you could say that New Orleans is the high school of Folgers."
56:35;56:38;"I guess for the beans, it kind of is."
56:38;56:40;"That's where those beans came of age."
56:40;56:42;"They come of age in Guatemala,"
56:42;56:45;"and then they go to high school in New Orleans,"
56:45;56:48;"and then they go to grad school in Ohio."
56:48;56:49;"I mean--"
56:49;56:50;"Hold on."
56:50;56:52;"But the reason I was bringing up the Fender thing"
56:52;56:54;"is don't you think it would be a little bit disingenuous?"
56:54;56:56;"Maybe this is apples and oranges. Tell me if I'm wrong."
56:56;56:59;"But if Fender did a campaign,"
56:59;57:03;"say they were really trying to, as you sometimes see,"
57:03;57:06;"kind of suck up to the Hispanic market,"
57:06;57:09;"and they just said, in Spanish,"
57:09;57:11;"""Allow us to reintroduce ourselves."
57:11;57:13;"Yo soy Fender."
57:13;57:16;"My hometown is Guadalajara, Mexico."""
57:16;57:18;"And people would be like, ""Wait, what do you mean?"
57:18;57:20;"Fender is famously an American company."""
57:20;57:21;"It's like, ""No, no, no."
57:21;57:23;"We have a factory in Mexico"
57:23;57:25;"where many of our guitars are made."
57:25;57:27;"We love our Fender factory."
57:27;57:28;"We consider that our hometown."""
57:28;57:30;"That would be a real stretch."
57:30;57:31;"That'd be a real stretch."
57:31;57:33;"Not really analogous to the Folgers sitch."
57:33;57:36;"Okay, fine. I give it up. Maybe it's not analogous."
57:36;57:38;"I respect the deep dive,"
57:38;57:40;"but it's been submitted to a jury of your peers."
57:40;57:42;"Fair enough."
57:42;57:44;"We're all letting Folgers off the hook on this one."
57:44;57:46;"I got just a little something to add to this."
57:46;57:47;"Yeah."
57:47;57:52;"I noticed that, similar to the dam being added to Folgers,"
57:52;57:56;"at some point, they changed the best part of waking up"
57:56;57:58;"to waking up."
57:58;58:00;"Oh, trying to be a little more folksy?"
58:00;58:03;"Yeah, it seems like, when I was a kid,"
58:03;58:04;"it was waking up."
58:04;58:06;"Now it seems like it's waking."
58:06;58:09;"The best damn part of waking up"
58:09;58:11;"is Folgers in your cup."
58:11;58:12;"I don't like that."
58:12;58:14;"Damn it."
58:14;58:17;"I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation"
58:17;58:22;"Living in the past, it's a new generation"
58:22;58:26;"Go do what you want to do"
58:26;58:28;"And that's what I'm gonna do"
58:28;58:31;"And I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation"
58:31;58:36;"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
58:36;58:38;"Not me"
58:38;58:41;"And I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation"
58:41;58:46;"Never said I wanted to move my station"
58:46;58:50;"I love you, you're good while I have you gone"
58:50;58:52;"And I don't ever need no one"
58:52;58:55;"And I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation"
58:55;58:58;"Folgers, congratulations on your rebrand."
58:58;59:02;"I withdraw my critique of you calling New Orleans your hometown."
59:02;59:06;"That is your hometown, and I will be switching out"
59:06;59:09;"all the hipster coffee in my house for Folgers."
59:09;59:11;"See if anybody notices."
59:11;59:13;"That's what I would do if I was them."
59:13;59:19;"I would be like, Folgers, all-American brand, hometown, New Orleans."
59:19;59:22;"I would make some sort of challenge."
59:22;59:25;"We're a heritage American brand, 172 years old,"
59:25;59:29;"roasting an iconic American city, New Orleans."
59:29;59:33;"Whatever kind of local hipster bullsh*t that you think is good coffee"
59:33;59:36;"and that supports local business and all that sh*t,"
59:36;59:37;"it has nothing on us."
59:37;59:38;"So here's what I want you to do."
59:38;59:41;"Pour all that sh*t out for all your roommates in Bushwick."
59:41;59:43;"Replace it with Folgers."
59:43;59:45;"And you see if anybody says a damn word."
59:45;59:48;"If anything, they're gonna say the coffee tastes better than usual."
59:48;59:53;"Smash cut to like 98% of people like, ""What is this?"""
59:53;59:56;"I got a hashtag, they won't say a damn--"
59:56;59:58;"Who bought the coffee? What is this?"
59:58;01:00:02;"And the new case, ""Shut your damn mouth, it's Folgers."""
01:00:02;01:00:03;"You know what's interesting?"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"I really do feel like Folgers for a minute has been--"
01:00:06;01:00:10;"They're just trying to find their voice online, you know, on Twitter."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"It's tough to do."
01:00:11;01:00:12;"It's really tough to do."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"And they sent this one around Halloween."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"It's a last-minute calendar invite."
01:00:17;01:00:18;"Spooky."
01:00:18;01:00:25;"#Halloween #TheBestPartOfWakingUp, by the way, with a G."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"And this is only a couple months ago."
01:00:27;01:00:31;"And there's a picture of a mug, steaming hot cup of coffee."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"It says, ""The only thing to fear is the 5 p.m. meeting itself."""
01:00:34;01:00:36;"And it's quoting itself."
01:00:36;01:00:39;"Folgers is who said that on the coffee mug."
01:00:39;01:00:44;"And there's 10 likes in one retweet."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"And there's something about a company."
01:00:46;01:00:50;"It really is like, who retweeted so sad?"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"I'm looking up."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"I'm trying to say who it's retweeted by, and it says, ""No items."""
01:00:54;01:00:58;"But there's something about one retweet and 10 likes."
01:00:58;01:01:03;"It was retweeted by the personal account of the marketing person at Folgers."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Totally."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Yeah."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"I mean, there's something about that."
01:01:06;01:01:10;"That's so dark."
01:01:10;01:01:16;"How many followers does Folgers have?"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"Folgers has 22,000, or almost 23,000."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"22.8."
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Oh, not bad."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"Are there any other recent Folgers tweets with ""Damn"" in it?"
01:01:26;01:01:30;"I'm going to look, but I just want to tell you, when I look up who they're following,"
01:01:30;01:01:33;"it's like--I mean, it's really fun to see."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"It's like the number one people that come up that when I just like, ""Who are they following?"""
01:01:37;01:01:43;"And it's Splenda, GFuel, Evan Strong, which I guess he's a snowboarder."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"But it's like Twitter creators bustle."
01:01:46;01:01:47;"I mean, it's just all--"
01:01:47;01:01:50;"I bet a lot of those brands are also owned by JM Smucker."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Yeah."
01:01:51;01:01:54;"It's a very hermetically sealed universe."
01:01:54;01:02:01;"Oh, so on February 8th, there are millions of damn proud Folgers drinkers out there."
01:02:01;01:02:05;"But only the @TryGuys take it seriously."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"#DamnRightIt'sFolgers."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"I mean, they're leaning into this damn thing."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"#DamnRight."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"They're damn proud."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"Oh, they're leaning into this semi-curse."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Let's see."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Yep, he's retweeting."
01:02:18;01:02:22;"Oh, millions of other damn proud Folgers drinkers."
01:02:22;01:02:30;"The more we talk about it, I really do find it funny and charming that Folgers decided to bet big on the word ""damn."""
01:02:30;01:02:32;"It is charming."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Damn right New Orleans is my hometown."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Damn right."
01:02:37;01:02:40;"Some Joe Biden energy to it, I feel."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"Right."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"Back when Joe Biden would be talking about--"
01:02:44;01:02:51;"Didn't he do a classic Biden gaffe where he was like, ""Just the other day, I was in Wilmington, Delaware, and he named some diner."""
01:02:51;01:02:54;"And it would have been closed for like 30 years."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Oh, man."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"And I'll give him a pass."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"That's just some campaign trail s--t."
01:02:58;01:03:09;"Just the grooves of his brain, so worn down that he was just like, ""When I go back to Wilmington, Joe, you haven't been to Wilmington in 30 years."""
01:03:09;01:03:10;"All right."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Shout out to Folgers."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"I'll be drinking a lot of that over the next week."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"And now some really big news."
01:03:16;01:03:24;"From burgers to coffee, and now for dessert, which is what this food item really should be, Pop-Tarts."
01:03:24;01:03:41;"I mean, in one of these things, you know, clearly we're still living in the TC universe because Jerry Seinfeld will be producing, starring, and directing a new comedy based around the creation of Pop-Tarts called ""Unfrosted."""
01:03:41;01:03:47;"He co-wrote the movie with Spike Ferriston, friend of the show, and Barry Marder, who he wrote ""Bee Movie"" with."
01:03:47;01:03:53;"And it's based off a joke Seinfeld has been telling for years about the first time he discovered Pop-Tarts as a kid."
01:03:53;01:03:56;"And I guess they announced this last year."
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Did we ever talk about it?"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"I don't think so."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"That's amazing we didn't talk about it."
01:04:00;01:04:05;"They announced this, but it was back in the news because now it's official. All systems are go."
01:04:05;01:04:11;"Because California is giving Seinfeld and the project a $14 million tax credit to make ""Unfrosted."""
01:04:11;01:04:17;"With Seinfeld adding, ""We're so happy to get the California tax credit, which enables us to make our whole movie there."
01:04:17;01:04:22;"Having made all of the Seinfeld series in LA, I very much wanted to come back and shoot there again."
01:04:22;01:04:26;"On behalf of everyone working on the movie, we really appreciate the great welcome."""
01:04:26;01:04:27;"Was it always like this?"
01:04:27;01:04:34;"Nick, you work in that part of showbiz where it's just kind of funny to me that it's a big news story that's like,"
01:04:34;01:04:39;"""Hey, guess what? This state is cutting a huge tax deal. They're going to come shoot here."""
01:04:39;01:04:42;"Always been this way? That this is a news item?"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"Everybody's like, ""Yes! California!"""
01:04:44;01:04:46;"It's very variety."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"Right."
01:04:47;01:04:55;"Yeah, I mean, it is an industry that has at minimum three major daily publications about itself."
01:04:55;01:05:01;"So you're looking for news items, but I think to your point, no, this has never been a news item."
01:05:01;01:05:12;"I think it's very much that Atlanta, New York, New Orleans, Louisiana have these big tax—Canada has these—"
01:05:12;01:05:18;"I think that there's something about trying to create business in LA and say, ""This is a good place to shoot,"""
01:05:18;01:05:23;"that's been historically too difficult, that I feel like they're trying to generate some news story here."
01:05:23;01:05:30;"I mean, the idea that tax credits are a news story is—I mean, yeah, that itself is a bit ridiculous."
01:05:30;01:05:35;"And maybe part of my reaction too is—maybe I'm on some Bernie Sanders sh*t here—"
01:05:35;01:05:43;"is just that I would have thought that back in the day that a tax credit was something that they'd want to almost keep quiet."
01:05:43;01:05:48;"One way of looking at it is a little bit like, ""Oh, you're cutting a big deal for this rich industry?"
01:05:48;01:05:52;"Yeah, you're going to create some jobs, I guess, but that's a lot of money."""
01:05:52;01:05:57;"You know, there's definitely a kind of lefty way of looking at stuff like that as a little bit shameful,"
01:05:57;01:06:03;"but maybe now it's so widespread that even California has to ask Jerry to do some press about it."
01:06:03;01:06:11;"Be like, ""Hey, we're cutting $14 million off your tax bill. If you could please go say how great that is, we'd appreciate it."""
01:06:11;01:06:19;"The idea that Jerry Seinfeld would have part of his press rollout for doing his first thing in however many years"
01:06:19;01:06:25;"and he'd be talking about wanting to be back in LA due to a tax credit, I mean, that feels like psyops."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"Like, that is what's weird."
01:06:27;01:06:33;"Yeah, it feels a little strange, but I guess whatever it takes—and I guess to be fair, I don't really know,"
01:06:33;01:06:39;"but if you think about Atlanta, those tax breaks seem to have paid off."
01:06:39;01:06:45;"I mean, they shoot so much stuff. They built studios that must create jobs long-term that must have generated revenue."
01:06:45;01:06:51;"Sometimes you hear about some state that tries it and then regrets it and is like, ""Why did we do that? That wasn't worth it."""
01:06:51;01:06:53;"But whatever, that's besides the point."
01:06:53;01:06:58;"The main point is that Jerry Seinfeld, due to a $14 million tax credit from the state of California,"
01:06:58;01:07:04;"will now officially be making his Pop-Tarts movie, and this must be something he's very passionate about"
01:07:04;01:07:12;"because Jerry Seinfeld is famously a very wealthy man, famously a guy who does what he wants to do."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"He likes doing comedy. He likes driving vintage cars."
01:07:16;01:07:22;"I'm so sorry, but even thinking about—yeah, something's going on here. I'm sorry, I'm slow on the uptake."
01:07:22;01:07:31;"The idea that this man is so wealthy that the $14 million to come here—like, none of that seems true."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"Like, he can cover the $14 million. Do you know what I mean?"
01:07:35;01:07:41;"It's a Netflix production, so it's Netflix who's getting $14 million written off their costs."
01:07:41;01:07:48;"But the idea that they're saying that anything to do with the taxes, anything to do with the financial,"
01:07:48;01:07:55;"the budget is part of this story, it seems very—something's very sus about this."
01:07:55;01:07:58;"Like, almost so much that when you sent it to me, I think that it's not getting made."
01:07:58;01:08:00;"I guess is really what I'm getting at."
01:08:00;01:08:05;"I had a very immediate feeling. I was like, ""Oh, this isn't real."""
01:08:05;01:08:06;"It doesn't sound real."
01:08:06;01:08:13;"We're never going to see this movie. This is an ad for LA tax credits for film."
01:08:13;01:08:16;"You know, like, 10 years of hazard, whatever happened to them?"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"That is pretty funny. That's a funny concept."
01:08:18;01:08:25;"Just like, ""LA, we gave Jerry Seinfeld $14 million to do his Pop-Tarts movie. Anything can happen."""
01:08:25;01:08:28;"People are like, ""Okay, maybe we should start shooting back in California."
01:08:28;01:08:35;"Buying all those flights for all these Hollywood movie stars out to Georgia. Why not?"""
01:09:10;01:09:16;"But then it got us kind of thinking about Pop-Tarts, which I don't think we've ever really gone deep on on the show."
01:09:16;01:09:20;"I think it's worth going through a little bit of Pop-Tarts food history."
01:09:20;01:09:23;"Jake, you want to take this? You did a little bit of research?"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"Yeah, I poked around a little bit."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"They first hit the market in '64."
01:09:28;01:09:33;"Also, current sales is around 2 billion units a year, which is unreal."
01:09:33;01:09:39;"One of every three people on earth is eating Pop-Tarts at least once a year."
01:09:39;01:09:43;"But yeah, it sounds like a case of corporate espionage."
01:09:43;01:09:50;"The Post cereal brand was deep in the weeds on producing a product called Country Squares,"
01:09:50;01:09:54;"which was a toaster-prepared breakfast pastry."
01:09:54;01:10:01;"And the Kellogg's company caught wind of this, and they jumped on it, kind of an arms race style."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"And they're like, ""Well, we're going to do that."""
01:10:03;01:10:10;"I guess the big breakthrough was because there's moisture inside the Pop-Tart pocket,"
01:10:10;01:10:15;"and to keep that at room temperature was the big breakthrough."
01:10:15;01:10:25;"To keep something that was moist and not sealed in a jar was kind of a weird engineering breakthrough or some sort of food processing."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"So the foil, the individually wrapped or the double wrapped."
01:10:28;01:10:31;"It's not airtight, that foil."
01:10:31;01:10:40;"There was some sort of food processing breakthrough, which allowed them to have moist food products be shelf-stable for many months."
01:10:40;01:10:43;"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The foil is not airtight? It's porous?"
01:10:43;01:10:46;"Yeah, I don't think that foil is airtight."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"It's tight enough, I guess."
01:10:47;01:10:56;"But yeah, I guess when you put it that way, and in '64, it must have seemed pretty space-age to pull out that foil package."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"We're really living in the future."
01:10:58;01:11:04;"And I guess also, if you were born in the 19th century, they would have been very old,"
01:11:04;01:11:08;"but there could have been somebody born during the Civil War who ate a Pop-Tart."
01:11:08;01:11:11;"Totally. They would have been 100 years old, yeah."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"It's totally possible."
01:11:13;01:11:17;"And they've been eating jam spread on their toast for 100 years,"
01:11:17;01:11:22;"and all of a sudden their great-grandkid pulls out this foil from a box."
01:11:22;01:11:27;"There definitely could have been somebody who sailed on the Titanic who ate a Pop-Tart."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Oh, absolutely."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"That timing works out perfectly."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:31;01:11:34;"Yeah, like Kate Winslet's character in the movie Titanic."
01:11:34;01:11:39;"She, you know, whatever, she was like 20-something when the Titanic sailed."
01:11:39;01:11:41;"She would have been..."
01:11:41;01:11:45;"What was that? 19 or something? 1920?"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"1912, something like that."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"Okay, something."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"Seinfeld, Giga Number Crunch, when did the Titanic sail?"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"It was 1911."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"1911."
01:11:53;01:11:58;"So, yeah, so you're 20 years old, a wealthy young woman sailing on the Titanic."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"Rose."
01:11:59;01:12:00;"Your name's Rose."
01:12:00;01:12:04;"You have a romance with this kind of working-class wild guy."
01:12:04;01:12:10;"You famously push him into the ocean at the end, and then you go off and live your life."
01:12:10;01:12:14;"So you were born in 1891."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Then you're 73 years old."
01:12:16;01:12:20;"You're living in Rye, New York, in a stately home."
01:12:20;01:12:24;"You have, you know, a bunch of kids, a bunch of grandkids,"
01:12:24;01:12:28;"and one day the maid comes home with something new from the shop called Pop-Tarts,"
01:12:28;01:12:33;"and you try it, and you think-- you pull open this foil wrapper, and you say, ""What is this?"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"God, I'm really living in the future."
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Can you believe this?"
01:12:36;01:12:39;"I survived the Titanic, and now I'm eating a Pop-Tart."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"Wow, I've really seen a lot."""
01:12:41;01:12:44;"But also, when you imagine this person, this Rose character,"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"who's eating a Pop-Tart for the first time,"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"it's interesting what you're saying, Jake, about the moistness,"
01:12:48;01:12:54;"because, of course, we're all born long after the Pop-Tart hit the scene,"
01:12:54;01:12:58;"and we can take for granted that to pull something off the shelf"
01:12:58;01:13:02;"that might have been in your pantry for a year--"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"maybe I'm going crazy-- let's say six months."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"You pull out a box from your pantry, you open the foil,"
01:13:07;01:13:10;"you crack one of those open, you take a bite,"
01:13:10;01:13:15;"and it's this moist jam inside, and it's totally healthy."
01:13:15;01:13:19;"You don't have to worry about getting botulism or dying."
01:13:19;01:13:22;"That probably was quite a game-changer."
01:13:22;01:13:28;"Is there anything sadder than this woman who's been on the Titanic eating escargot,"
01:13:28;01:13:32;"and later in life, they're like, ""Taste this Pop-Tart."""
01:13:32;01:13:38;"No, I think it's progress, because I think this woman thinks back to her time on the Titanic"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"and thinks about it was a stressful time for her."
01:13:41;01:13:45;"She was caught in between Billy Zane and the Leo character."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"She watched all these people die."
01:13:47;01:13:48;"Jack Dawson."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"Jack Dawson. She watched all these people die."
01:13:51;01:13:54;"Probably after going through all that, you want simplicity,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"and a Pop-Tart is very simple."
01:13:56;01:14:00;"She's like, ""This tastes like fresh jam,"" and they say, ""Grandma, this isn't jam."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"This is some--"""
01:14:02;01:14:05;"Well, it's a jam-like product to hide in shelf people."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"You'll never believe it. There's no fruit in this product."
01:14:08;01:14:14;"Probably when she was a little girl, if she wanted to eat something that delicious and fruity and moist,"
01:14:14;01:14:21;"she'd have to sneak off to the larder and find a jar of jam and open it"
01:14:21;01:14:26;"and then spread it on the toast and all this stuff and probably get caught later."
01:14:26;01:14:30;"Probably the next day, she would get hell from the cooks"
01:14:30;01:14:35;"when they saw that she'd opened that jam that they'd jarred the previous autumn"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"and that they were saving."
01:14:37;01:14:39;"It probably was a nightmare."
01:14:39;01:14:45;"To be able to walk into your suburban home, open that foil, crack that thing open,"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"in 1964, you probably felt--"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"On top of the world."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"You probably felt on top of the world."
01:14:51;01:14:55;"That's even amidst all the turmoil of the 1960s, the assassination of JFK,"
01:14:55;01:15:00;"things of that nature, you still would have had a great feeling."
01:15:00;01:15:05;"And then also, maybe even to know that that came out of the competitive American spirit,"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"to know, ""Oh, Kellogg's stole this idea from Post, but you know what?"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"That's American capitalism, the entrepreneurial spirit."
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Whoever gets there first."""
01:15:13;01:15:15;"I think this woman would feel pretty good."
01:15:15;01:15:20;"I think she'd also be excited about the very savvy branding on the Kellogg's part"
01:15:20;01:15:26;"because Post was in the shop, kind of like dilly-dallying for too long."
01:15:26;01:15:31;"They couldn't get their product out, and their product was going to be called Country Squares."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Old-fashioned."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"Absolute snoozefest."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"Country Squares."
01:15:35;01:15:43;"In 1962, an artist from New York named Andy Warhol became very famous overnight, almost,"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"which is amazing."
01:15:45;01:15:51;"He did a show in LA, actually, of all places, which is perfect, at the Ferris Gallery."
01:15:51;01:15:54;"He did his first exhibition of the Campbell's Soup Cans."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"In 1962?"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"In 1962."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"Then he was in Time Magazine that year."
01:16:00;01:16:06;"There was a whole spread about him and this new emergent art style called pop art."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"The guys at Kellogg's were like..."
01:16:09;01:16:11;"This is full Draper at this point."
01:16:11;01:16:15;"They're like, ""We're not making Pop-Tarts. We're making Pop-Tarts."""
01:16:15;01:16:18;"Right. The future is now."
01:16:18;01:16:25;"I don't know if Rose and Rye New York is going to be hip to the Pop-Tart pun with pop art,"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"but certainly the market executives were."
01:16:28;01:16:31;"It doesn't really matter if you get the reference or not."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"If you get the reference, it's that much richer."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"I hope this was included in Jerry's script."
01:16:35;01:16:37;"Oh, definitely."
01:16:37;01:16:41;"By the way, if the Jerry Pop-Tarts movie turns out to be fake,"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"well, Netflix, TC has an even better idea."
01:16:44;01:16:47;"Not only is this a Pop-Tart based story,"
01:16:47;01:16:51;"it also functions as a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time, Titanic."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"That is true."
01:16:52;01:16:56;"It opens 1964 with Rose."
01:16:56;01:16:59;"What is she? She's fondling her necklace."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"Then she puts it down."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"A pearl. She's touching the pearls."
01:17:03;01:17:07;"She's touching her pearls. Then she puts the pearls down,"
01:17:07;01:17:11;"walks down to the kitchen, opens a Pop-Tart."
01:17:11;01:17:15;"I also like, Jake, that Post was making country squares,"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"and then Kellogg's decided we're going to make our own version."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"Initially, they were going to call it Fruit Scone, another snooze fest."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"Very old-fashioned."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Yeah."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Shout out to whatever funny-"
01:17:25;01:17:29;"I'd say older sounding country squares."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"That's almost medieval. Terrible names."
01:17:32;01:17:33;"Pop-Tarts."
01:17:33;01:17:34;"It's a winner."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"It's totally a winner. It sounds great."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"And by the way, just so everybody knows, this is not a bit."
01:17:39;01:17:43;"It says this in our notes, the name Pop-Tarts came from Pop Art."
01:17:43;01:17:46;"And as Jake pointed out, the timing works perfectly."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"I wonder, I should have looked this up,"
01:17:48;01:17:51;"I wonder if there's any quotes from Warhol"
01:17:51;01:17:55;"about his supposed influence on the Pop-Tart brand."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"I wonder."
01:17:57;01:18:03;"I'd like to take a cement fix, bigger standing cinema."
01:18:03;01:18:12;"Dress my friends up just for show, see them as they really are."
01:18:12;01:18:18;"Put the people in my brain, two new pens to have a go."
01:18:18;01:18:27;"Try to be a gallery, put you all inside my show."
01:18:27;01:18:33;"Andy Warhol looks a scream, hang him on my wall."
01:18:33;01:18:41;"Andy Warhol's silver screen, can't tell them apart at all."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"Enough about corporate food history,"
01:18:43;01:18:47;"although actually I do want to just read some of the current flavors they have for Pop-Tarts."
01:18:47;01:18:50;"Because I always just like the plain ones, unfrosted."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"What about you guys?"
01:18:52;01:18:55;"It's been a minute since I've had a Pop-Tart."
01:18:55;01:18:59;"So I think this is a classic question, do you toast them?"
01:18:59;01:19:02;"Do you put them in or do you eat them cold?"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"I eat them cold. I'm a cold guy."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Same."
01:19:06;01:19:09;"I'm known for eating lots of food cold."
01:19:09;01:19:13;"Maybe not that known because you guys might not have known that about me."
01:19:13;01:19:16;"But I've never lived with any of you guys, I don't think."
01:19:16;01:19:19;"Me and Jake have toured America together, but that's different."
01:19:19;01:19:23;"In a domestic situation, people see me in the kitchen,"
01:19:23;01:19:26;"I can't even think of a good example, but I'll be eating something."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"People say, ""Are you eating that cold?"" And I'll say, ""Yeah."""
01:19:28;01:19:30;"I'll give you an example."
01:19:30;01:19:34;"So we're basically two and two, because I'm eating it cold."
01:19:34;01:19:38;"If we had had meatballs the night before, I'm eating those cold."
01:19:38;01:19:39;"Oh, absolutely."
01:19:39;01:19:40;"Cold pizza?"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"Oh, yeah. Everybody loves cold pizza."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"There's a difference, though."
01:19:44;01:19:51;"I think eating leftovers of a dish that's been prepared by a chef or a cook is different."
01:19:51;01:19:57;"I think eating a manufactured product that's meant to be heated up"
01:19:57;01:20:00;"and then eating that at room temp is weird."
01:20:00;01:20:05;"Would you open a can of refried beans and just eat those at room temp?"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"Yes."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"No way."
01:20:07;01:20:08;"And I'll tell you what."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"That's psycho."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"I've done it with soup."
01:20:11;01:20:16;"There's something about a cold chicken noodle soup that I actually find very appealing."
01:20:16;01:20:21;"I'm not against a hot chicken soup, but there are times in my life where I've had a prepared--"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"Has it been in a can?"
01:20:23;01:20:27;"I might have had a bougie one that was in a jar, but I looked at it and I said,"
01:20:27;01:20:28;"""I could heat this up right now."""
01:20:28;01:20:29;"But you know what?"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"It's almost like drinking pickle juice."
01:20:31;01:20:38;"Just having a cold, briny chicken soup was appealing to me in the moment out there."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"I love you saying, ""I'm not against eating a hot chicken soup."""
01:20:42;01:20:45;"Now, do you?"
01:20:45;01:20:51;"If only the listeners at home could see the disgust on Jake's face, the rubbing of the temple."
01:20:51;01:20:54;"Jake, you're telling me you never do a cold chicken soup, man?"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"Never."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"That's malarkey."
01:20:56;01:21:00;"I'm just thinking about those room temperature refried beans out of the can."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"That is psycho."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"That's one step beyond your chicken noodle hot show."
01:21:05;01:21:12;"It's going to have that layer of congealed fat, like that quarter inch of congealed fat right on the top as you open it."
01:21:12;01:21:15;"Let me back up a little bit just to be totally honest."
01:21:15;01:21:21;"As I'm saying this, I'm realizing that most of the time when I'm eating this stuff, it's actually not room temp."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"It's cold."
01:21:23;01:21:27;"Maybe I'm not totally being honest."
01:21:27;01:21:35;"I can picture many times going to the fridge and finding an open can of refried beans."
01:21:35;01:21:41;"Maybe somebody used it to make nachos and they put the can back in with the top still on."
01:21:41;01:21:42;"Wow."
01:21:42;01:21:47;"I would happily grab that cold, the cold refried beans and eat that."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"That's a great snack."
01:21:49;01:22:00;"It's not quite as crazy as going to the pantry, taking out the refried beans, taking out the can opener, and then just starting to eat it."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"I agree."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"That would be pretty weird."
01:22:02;01:22:08;"But somehow when it's cold, a half filled refried beans can when it's cold, that's a great snack."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"You're on the go."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"This is some dirtbag stuff, man."
01:22:11;01:22:15;"This is the scuzziest part of Ezra's personality."
01:22:15;01:22:20;"We're seven years in on this program and I'm learning new things."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"I think it's scuzzy that everything has to be hot."
01:22:22;01:22:23;"That's freaky."
01:22:23;01:22:25;"That's freaky deaky, man."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"No, it's not."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"That's freaky deaky, man."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Everything has to be hot."
01:22:29;01:22:31;"He's acting sort of more primal."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"You're definitely post fire."
01:22:33;01:22:35;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:22:35;01:22:36;"No."
01:22:36;01:22:38;"You can't heat this up."
01:22:38;01:22:43;"He's operating from almost like early, early man."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"But there weren't canned refried beans before fire."
01:22:46;01:22:49;"It's a product that's meant to be heated."
01:22:49;01:22:57;"The refried beans, because I will say refried beans is specific because they've been sort of already cooked and fried and then canned."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"But I'll eat like cold black beans."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Refried beans is already weird."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Let's forget about the cans and everything."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"Cold refried beans taste good."
01:23:06;01:23:07;"No."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"I agree."
01:23:09;01:23:12;"Well, I guess there's just no seeing eye to eye on this one."
01:23:12;01:23:13;"I'm team Jake on this."
01:23:13;01:23:14;"No pun intended."
01:23:14;01:23:17;"Let's bring the temperature down a bit on this debate."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"But cold refried beans taste good."
01:23:19;01:23:33;"If you were making nachos and there was hot melted cheese, cold sour cream, spicy jalapenos, and maybe also some warm pulled pork, and then the refried beans were cold."
01:23:33;01:23:35;"I think it's good."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"I think that's good."
01:23:36;01:23:39;"Well, that's different, though, because other elements are hot."
01:23:39;01:23:41;"That's like you can mix it in with it."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"I'm going to give I want to get I'm really aligned with Ezra on this."
01:23:44;01:23:50;"I have to say that if you've had you not had like a bean and cheese burrito and you go, you know what?"
01:23:50;01:23:55;"This is good, but it's going to be really good after it cools down, maybe even after it's been in the fridge."
01:23:55;01:23:58;"No, I reheat burritos."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"I like a burrito."
01:24:00;01:24:01;"You know what?"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"I eat half of it."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Three hours later, I'm finishing it."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"I'm reheating."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"That's right."
01:24:05;01:24:10;"No, I really maybe I was traumatized by something in childhood, but I really dislike a lot of reheated foods."
01:24:10;01:24:17;"I feel like there was time where I'd be eating like a reheated piece of meat that had been reheated in the microwave."
01:24:17;01:24:20;"And like the fat was all like tasted nasty."
01:24:20;01:24:24;"There's a flavor of reheated fat and meat that I find disgusting."
01:24:24;01:24:25;"You know, like meat."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"You can only what the hell you're talking about."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"All right."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"Agree to disagree."
01:24:29;01:24:36;"Well, I will say to your defense, the Pop-Tart thing, those Pop-Tarts get mighty hot when they come out of the toaster and you got to wait."
01:24:36;01:24:44;"I also do want to say if we're leaving this, if we're agreeing to disagree, Pop-Tarts are also meant to be eaten cold."
01:24:44;01:24:50;"I think that there's something in it that is definitely like open up and go."
01:24:50;01:24:59;"And if you want to wait around and toast it, but I think that by design, I think its success is that it's a 50/50."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Yeah, yeah."
01:25:00;01:25:07;"In the name Pop-Tart, the pop doesn't that. I always thought that suggested the popping out of the toaster."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"No, no, it refers to the word popular."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Is it not a double entendre though?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"It is."
01:25:13;01:25:16;"Sure. That's the only reason people even toast it."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"No, no, no, no, no."
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Yes."
01:25:18;01:25:19;"During my insomnia."
01:25:19;01:25:27;"Now, listen, during my insomnia, I was reading about Pop-Tarts at 345 the other night and they were designed as a toaster item."
01:25:27;01:25:35;"That's a breakfast toaster item. You pop it in the toaster. It's in there for a minute. It pops out. Boom. It's warm. Eat it. It's great."
01:25:35;01:25:43;"Then this was a surprise to Kellogg. People started just eating them straight out of the box because people are pathetic and they're dirt bags."
01:25:43;01:25:45;"Okay. They're meant to be heated."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Uncool."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"It's literally, it's like a toaster strudel."
01:25:49;01:25:58;"They're dirt bags, folks. They're low lives. They're low lives. These people, they eat the Pop-Tart. They don't even take the time to put it in the toaster."
01:25:58;01:26:03;"Straight out of the, they're ripping the foil out. They can't even contain themselves. Ripping the foil so fast."
01:26:03;01:26:11;"I want to paint a very, like a picture for you. The only time I ever ate Pop-Tarts is that they were in the vending machine in my high school."
01:26:11;01:26:13;"Oh, I remember vending machine Pop-Tarts."
01:26:13;01:26:19;"When am I going to toast a Pop-Tart at my high school?"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"You can microwave a Pop-Tart."
01:26:21;01:26:26;"Yeah, maybe. But the point is, is that it's certainly there for the people that are like, you know what?"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"Wait, what student has access to a microwave in high school?"
01:26:29;01:26:33;"I had a microwave in my cafeteria. There was a microwave you could walk up to."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"That's some Canadian s***."
01:26:35;01:26:44;"Hey, don't Canadian that. 8minutecapecod@gmail.com. If you had a microwave in your high school, it's the numeral 8."
01:26:44;01:26:49;"It does seem like a microwave in the cafeteria is asking for trouble with high school kids."
01:26:49;01:26:55;"Yes, especially in the 90s, people were microwaving frogs and putting metal in there and stuff."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Wait, wait, if you were supervised."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Wait, is the sign for..."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"If you were a responsible kid."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"You went to a one microwave high school?"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Yeah, there was one microwave."
01:27:03;01:27:07;"There's probably one in the teacher's lounge."
01:27:07;01:27:08;"Sure."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"Look, you're not a dirtbag if you don't toast your Pop-Tarts."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"First of all, it's a kind of fun surprise that yes, toasters pop."
01:27:15;01:27:19;"But Pop-Tarts were named after the pop art movement of Andy Warhol."
01:27:19;01:27:23;"Andy Warhol, he was very interested in recontextualizing things."
01:27:23;01:27:28;"As you well know, Jake, as you said, famously he would take the Campbell's Soup logo."
01:27:28;01:27:35;"Prior to that, people might have only seen on the shelves at a grocery store."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"Andy Warhol and his genius said, ""Well, you know what? I think that's beautiful."
01:27:38;01:27:44;"I'm going to silkscreen that real big and now it's going to hang in the homes of rich and powerful people"
01:27:44;01:27:50;"and in the finest museums in the world because you have choice in this weird corporate world."
01:27:50;01:27:54;"You can take something and do what you want with it."""
01:27:54;01:27:59;"And given that the Pop-Tart was directly inspired by his ethos,"
01:27:59;01:28:04;"I think it's very clear that they expected that most people would not toast them"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"because this was the '60s. There's a new sense of freedom in there,"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"a new outlook on food and art."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"This is a great spin. I love it."
01:28:12;01:28:14;"I got to ask you a question."
01:28:14;01:28:19;"Jake, when you go to the coffee shop wearing your--"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"What's the shirt we make Jake wear when he goes to a coffee shop?"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"Breaking news, I don't care."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"So you're in the coffee shop, breaking news, I don't care."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"You order a Danish or a croissant."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"I was like, ""I should at least be productive."""
01:28:30;01:28:32;"But you order a Danish or a croissant."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"I have this homework assignment for TC."
01:28:34;01:28:37;"I got to put some notes together about Pop-Tarts."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"[laughter]"
01:28:39;01:28:44;"Do you-- When you order a piece of-- Not a bagel."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"That was a real round the horn there."
01:28:46;01:28:50;"We did Folgers, McDonald's, and Pop-Tarts."
01:28:50;01:28:52;"This ratio is just out of control."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"We got a little bit of music in."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"All right, so Jake, you walk into the coffee shop like Nick said."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"They're playing Neil Young on the speakers."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"Yep."
01:29:03;01:29:07;"And they say, ""Okay, I would like a Danish or a croissant."""
01:29:07;01:29:08;"Yeah."
01:29:08;01:29:10;"""Would you like it toasted or not toasted?"""
01:29:10;01:29:11;"I love where you're going."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"""Toasted or not toasted?"""

01:54:32;01:54:36;"Yeah, it's like jackass being like, ""Don't try this at home,"" or whatever."
01:54:36;01:54:39;"Or like an advertisement that's like, ""This is a reenactment."""
01:54:39;01:54:41;"This is satire."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"This is pop art."
01:54:48;01:54:51;"The number one song this week in 1964."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"Wow."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"It's the Beatles again."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."""
01:54:55;01:54:58;"Okay, so I wanna hold your hand and she loves you."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"Just a crazy one-two punch."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Better song."
01:55:10;01:55:15;"When I hear these early Beatles singles, I'm actually usually surprised by how hard they are."
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Yeah."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"Fast."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"They're fast."
01:55:18;01:55:20;"They're kinda hard."
01:55:20;01:55:25;"I mean, Ringo has a light touch, but the cymbals just have like, ""Pfft."""
01:55:25;01:55:26;"Just intense."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"They're ringing out."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Yeah."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"And he claps pretty loud in the mix."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"Yeah."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"The harmonies are so good."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"And look at this cool part here."
01:55:52;01:55:55;"Listen how different it sounds without him bashing on the cymbals."
01:55:55;01:55:57;"It like, tightens up so much."
01:55:57;01:55:58;"Just the hi-hat."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"No, like, instrumental break either."
01:56:53;01:56:56;"It's just like, vocals through the entire thing."
01:56:56;01:56:57;"Yeah, very tight."
01:57:08;01:57:10;"And this chord right here."
01:57:16;01:57:21;"Congratulations to the Beatles at number one in the year of the Pop-Tart."
01:57:21;01:57:23;"1964."
01:57:23;01:57:27;"The number one song now on the Apple Music chart."
01:57:27;01:57:30;"And I think this has been number one for like, weeks now."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Kodak Black with Super Gremlin."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"Jake, do you like this?"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"Not really."
01:58:43;01:58:47;"I mean, I'm a little bit like Grandma Rose out here."
01:58:47;01:58:51;"I've heard like, 800 songs that sound exactly like this to me."
01:58:51;01:58:55;"But I'm not, I don't have a sophisticated understanding of the palette."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"I'm a little like Grandma Rose out here."
01:58:57;01:59:04;"I'm just like, I don't have like a sense of the criteria to distinguish between this song and like 800 other songs."
01:59:04;01:59:07;"Yeah, I think you'd have to listen to it a lot and like kind of get into the."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"Yeah, it's like anything."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"Get into the lyrics."
01:59:11;01:59:14;"I think Grandma Rose would be into that old timey chorus though."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"The Annie?"
01:59:16;01:59:20;"I guess that's a sample from How to Loot Brazil."
01:59:20;01:59:23;"Wait, can you play the song the samples from that?"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"Man, I really thought it was from Annie."
01:59:40;01:59:47;"Clogs taken at the speed of sound, swallowed, sucked into the almond clasp."
02:00:03;02:00:08;"This whole song about like somebody that he used to be friends with who like betrayed him."
02:00:08;02:00:10;"Like we could have been superstars."
02:00:10;02:00:13;"Remember when we were jacking cars?"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"What is this?"
02:00:15;02:00:17;"Is this like where the sample comes from?"
02:00:17;02:00:20;"This is How to Loot. What year is this?"
02:00:20;02:00:23;"This is what those kids are singing from?"
02:00:23;02:00:29;"This sounds like some real like 2009 blog house."
02:00:29;02:00:33;"So he had some kids like re-record that?"
02:00:33;02:00:35;"I don't know How to Loot Brazil."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"No, this is from 2019."
02:00:37;02:00:42;"How to Loot Brazil does not have, they don't have like a Wikipedia page or anything."
02:00:42;02:00:44;"I'm going over to their Insta."
02:00:44;02:00:46;"This is a tight sample."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"I think it's pretty obscure."
02:00:48;02:00:51;"Okay, so the producers just found it."
02:00:51;02:00:55;"In this song, the singer is saying, ""Yeah, we could be superstars."
02:00:55;02:00:58;"We've been rather wrecking cars."""
02:00:58;02:01:03;"And then Kodak turned it into, ""We could have been superstars."
02:01:03;02:01:06;"Like remember when we were jacking cars."""
02:01:06;02:01:12;"It seems like he's wistfully like remembering somebody he used to do like bad stuff with."
02:01:12;02:01:14;"But now he like can't trust them anymore."
02:01:14;02:01:16;"They switched."
02:01:16;02:01:18;"Now it's not safe for that person."
02:01:18;02:01:19;"They're enemies."
02:01:19;02:01:23;"The line that I think, but you know that is so interesting is that"
02:01:23;02:01:29;"when he was like, ""I knew that the perk was fake, but I ate it anyway because I'm a gremlin."""
02:01:29;02:01:31;"Which is like, that really blows my mind."
02:01:31;02:01:34;"Especially because you know with like with fentanyl and all this other stuff."
02:01:34;02:01:40;"So he's like, ""I knew the drugs were fake, but I ate it anyway because I'm a gremlin."""
02:01:40;02:01:46;"And there is like, it really is like the most evocative of like the movie."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"You know, like a real gremlin."
02:01:47;02:01:49;"Just like eating anything."
02:01:49;02:01:51;"I guess I kind of interpreted that too."
02:01:51;02:01:55;"If this is a song about him like reminiscing about an old friend who betrayed him."
02:01:55;02:02:01;"Almost like some old like cowboy song like Poncho and Lefty."
02:02:01;02:02:04;"You know, like two people who used to run around getting chased by the federales."
02:02:04;02:02:06;"And then one of them betrayed the other one."
02:02:06;02:02:12;"And I almost thought he's just kind of saying like, ""Man, remember all those crazy times we used to have?"
02:02:12;02:02:17;"Remember when you found those fake Percocets and I just ate it?"""
02:02:17;02:02:22;"It almost sounds like some kind of like weird adolescent memory that people would be sharing."
02:02:22;02:02:25;"""Remember we used to do all sorts of wild sh*t and then you switched up, man."""
02:02:25;02:02:26;"And then he switched."
02:02:26;02:02:28;"Yeah, I need to do a little more research."
02:02:28;02:02:33;"But that's my instinct is that this is a Poncho and Lefty situation."
02:02:33;02:02:35;"But it's first person."
02:02:35;02:02:38;"Well, that about does it for Time Crisis."
02:02:38;02:02:41;"Shout out to the year 1964."
02:02:41;02:02:44;"I know what I'll be having for breakfast for the next two weeks."
02:02:44;02:02:48;"A cup of Folgers and an untoasted Pop-Tart."
02:02:48;02:02:52;"Hot coffee and cold Pop-Tarts."
02:02:52;02:02:54;"That's the way we do it here."
02:02:54;02:02:56;"Alright, see everybody in two weeks. Peace."
02:02:56;02:03:00;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
02:03:00;02:03:02;"(gagging)"
