01:22;01:26;"I'm here with Jake and Jerrod Carmichael."
01:26;01:27;"What?"
01:27;01:29;"Honorary member of the Crisis Crew."
01:29;01:31;"I feel so connected to you guys."
01:31;01:33;"You've been on it more than anybody else."
01:33;01:35;"I like this place."
01:35;01:36;"It feels all warm and nice."
01:36;01:38;"We're very glad to have you back,"
01:38;01:41;"even if only for the beginning of the show."
01:41;01:43;"We appreciate that."
01:43;01:45;"Just to set the stage for the people at home,"
01:45;01:47;"because radio is not a visual medium,"
01:47;01:51;"both Jake and I are wearing Grateful Dead shirts right now."
01:51;01:53;"This was a gift you gave me just right now."
01:53;01:56;"I just gave Jake a bootleg Grateful Dead shirt"
01:56;01:59;"that's a Grateful Dead and Mets baseball shirt."
01:59;02:02;"Mets logo within the skull of the Steely logo."
02:02;02:06;"I was just browsing Grateful Dead shirts on the Internet."
02:06;02:08;"And you grew up as a Mets fan, right?"
02:08;02:11;"Yankees, but it's..."
02:11;02:13;"-I thought you were a Mets fan. -No, no."
02:13;02:14;"That's hilarious."
02:14;02:16;"I'm ride or die '86 Mets."
02:16;02:18;"-I mean, how can you not? -Okay, that's it."
02:18;02:20;"And I'm wearing this vintage weird one"
02:20;02:25;"that was from a series of concerts in 1985 in San Francisco."
02:25;02:27;"I thought it was Japan."
02:27;02:29;"I don't know if the Dead ever played Japan."
02:29;02:31;"-That's a good question. -It was the year of the ox."
02:31;02:34;"Anyway, we talk about the Grateful Dead on the show a lot."
02:34;02:36;"So, Jerrod, just before we started,"
02:37;02:39;"you said you weren't sure if you've ever heard a Grateful Dead song."
02:39;02:41;"Yeah, I don't think I've ever knowingly."
02:41;02:43;"I'll say knowingly. I'm sure I was in a bar or something."
02:43;02:46;"And it came on, and I was like, ""Oh, what is this?"""
02:46;02:51;"But knowingly, I don't think I've ever heard a single Grateful Dead song."
02:51;02:52;"-Interesting. -Yeah."
02:52;02:55;"Do you know the name of a single member of the band?"
02:55;02:58;"Uh, in there, Jerry?"
02:58;02:59;"-Yep. -Jerry what?"
02:59;03:01;"Uh, damn it."
03:01;03:02;"Jerry, uh..."
03:02;03:04;"You know, Jerry!"
03:04;03:06;"-Gar! -Jerry!"
03:06;03:08;"-Come on! -Jerry!"
03:08;03:11;"-Jerry Gar. -Gar's..."
03:11;03:13;"-Wait, what? -Jerry Garcia."
03:13;03:15;"-Garcia, that's right. -Sounds familiar."
03:15;03:19;"That's right. Oh, yeah, Jerry Garcia. Of course, Jerry Garcia."
03:19;03:20;"I wonder if you'd like them."
03:20;03:24;"I wonder what the most famous Dead song is that you might have heard."
03:24;03:28;"-Yo, is there one like in a commercial? -No."
03:28;03:29;"Oh."
03:29;03:33;"I mean, there's this one, like, driving that train high on cocaine."
03:33;03:35;"-Right. -Let's see."
03:37;03:42;"♪ Driving that train ♪"
03:42;03:45;"♪ High on cocaine ♪"
03:45;03:46;"Ringing a bell?"
03:46;03:48;"Nope, never heard it before in my life,"
03:48;03:52;"but I've never heard a title and a vibe match so perfectly."
03:52;03:54;"-True. -That sounds like you."
03:54;03:58;"Do you like hippie s***?"
03:58;04:03;"Yeah. I mean, it's a fun vibe, like, you know..."

04:20;04:24;"It just kind of sounds like your dad's friends."
04:24;04:27;"Just like your dad's friends singing, like, you know, ""Oh, that's fun."""
04:27;04:31;"Like, ""It's nice. Oh, you guys sound nice together."""
04:31;04:35;"All right, wait. How about this? They're known for their live shows."
04:35;04:37;"-Yeah, yeah. -So this is live."
04:37;04:40;"-China Cat? I was just thinking that. -Yeah."
04:40;04:45;"This is live in Paris in 1972."
04:45;04:51;"-This one's a little groovier. -Yeah, it's groovier."
04:53;05:01;"Oh, that's great."
05:01;05:02;"That was great."
05:02;05:05;"I feel like actually this is the one that wins people over."
05:05;05:07;"-Oh, that's fantastic. -Yeah."
05:07;05:09;"-Like, I've been... -That line is so sick."
05:09;05:12;"I've been listening to a lot of Dead at home a lot,"
05:12;05:15;"and the only time I ever listened to one where Rashida was like,"
05:15;05:16;"""What's that?"" was this."
05:16;05:21;"And something about this is, like, it's really soulful."
05:21;05:22;"Mm-hmm."
05:22;05:25;"I think the thing that Jake really likes about the Dead"
05:25;05:28;"and which I, via Jake, like about the Dead,"
05:28;05:29;"is just that tasteful guitar tone."
05:29;05:31;"It's all about the tasteful guitar."
05:31;05:32;"All right, how about this one?"
05:32;05:35;"Oh, come on."
05:35;05:37;"Wait, now you know this one."
05:37;05:39;"You know this one."
05:39;05:43;"What's this song?"
05:43;05:46;"♪ The reading rainbow ♪"
05:46;05:48;"The greatest theme song of all time?"
05:48;05:50;"-I know. -How old are you?"
05:50;05:53;"-30. -So you're 30, I'm 33."
05:53;05:55;"'Cause, Jake, you were, like, deeply unfamiliar with this."
05:55;05:56;"-Yeah. -Oh, you don't know this?"
05:56;05:57;"No, I didn't know it."
05:57;05:59;"-How old are you? -40."
05:59;06:00;"-Slightly different generation. -Okay, yeah, it's..."
06:00;06:03;"You're right after... 'Cause my brother wouldn't respond to this."
06:03;06:05;"-My brother's 39. -Really?"
06:05;06:07;"And he wouldn't respond to the reading."
06:07;06:09;"Right, we were right in the sweet spot."
06:09;06:11;"And they changed the theme."
06:11;06:12;"Like, they had a later one."
06:12;06:15;"-Chaka Khan, you were... -Yeah, oh, you're ahead."
06:15;06:16;"-Yeah. -You're reading Rainbow Head."
06:16;06:18;"Oh, yeah, I'm a Rainbow Head."
06:18;06:20;"Because we talked about this on the last episode,"
06:20;06:22;"and we're actually about to..."
06:22;06:24;"Dead heads are angry right now."
06:24;06:25;"-Right. -They're just angry."
06:25;06:28;"I'm like, ""Who are the Grateful Dead? Jerry what?"""
06:28;06:30;"And it's just like, ""No, I'm a Rainbow Head, bro."""
06:30;06:32;"-A Rainbow Head. -Just like, they hate..."
06:32;06:33;"-I'm sorry. -This is that real"
06:33;06:35;"kind of vibe hippie s***, reading Rainbow."
06:35;06:37;"Reading Rainbow. It's so..."
06:37;06:38;"Here's the thing, the theme..."
06:38;06:40;"This is me being honest."
06:40;06:41;"I don't want to perpetuate any stereotypes"
06:41;06:43;"being the only black person in the room, but I..."
06:43;06:46;"I love that theme song,"
06:46;06:47;"hated the show."
06:47;06:49;"I liked reading as a kid."
06:49;06:50;"-I read a lot. -Right."
06:50;06:52;"I don't need you to read to me."
06:52;06:56;"I didn't even like my mom reading stories to me as a kid."
06:56;06:59;"It's like, ""No, either tell me... Don't read a passage for me."
06:59;07:00;"I don't do books on tape."""
07:00;07:03;"-Well, it's not my vibe. -Right."
07:03;07:04;"Yeah, I don't want to..."
07:04;07:05;"-'Cause there are actual cartoons. -You like to do it yourself."
07:05;07:07;"I don't want to just s*** show."
07:07;07:09;"It's a good show."
07:09;07:11;"But it lived in this weird gray area"
07:11;07:13;"where it wasn't a cartoon"
07:13;07:14;"and it wasn't somebody reading to you."
07:14;07:17;"It was just like pictures of a book"
07:17;07:19;"where the camera moves, but the picture doesn't."
07:19;07:22;"And it's just like this purgatory of like..."
07:22;07:24;"-It's a poor man's cartoon. -It was like, ""Kill me."""
07:24;07:25;"-I'd rather... -Yeah, I know what you mean."
07:25;07:28;"Reading Rainbow wasn't paced well."
07:28;07:29;"Yeah, it was not paced well."
07:29;07:31;"LeVar Burton, incredibly condescending."
07:31;07:33;"-Incredibly. -As a host."
07:33;07:35;"The part I always thought was so awkward"
07:35;07:38;"is that they would force these five or six-year-old child actors"
07:38;07:39;"to do book reviews."
07:39;07:40;"We were talking about this last time"
07:40;07:42;"where the kids would just be like,"
07:42;07:44;"""Jumanji, it's a book."""
07:44;07:46;"And we're saying it's like so Vanessa Bayer on SNL."
07:46;07:48;"-Just like... -Rainbow fish."
07:48;07:49;"Rainbow fish."
07:49;07:51;"But don't take my word for it."
07:51;07:52;"But yeah, okay."
07:52;07:54;"And then once you show the fish, you've ruined the book."
07:54;07:55;"Yeah."
07:55;07:57;"Once you see the pop-out at the end"
07:57;07:59;"with the fish that's coming to its own..."
07:59;08:02;"It's also... Yeah, that show is nothing but spoilers."
08:02;08:03;"Spoilers."
08:03;08:05;"Spoiler alert, here's the ending of this book."
08:05;08:07;"Maybe the only good thing about Reading Rainbow was the song."
08:07;08:10;"-The song was perfect. -Also, before it even kicks in,"
08:10;08:11;"just listen to that synth."
08:11;08:14;"[synth music playing]"
08:14;08:16;"-Butterfly in the sky -Vibey."
08:16;08:18;"Oh, such a vibe."
08:18;08:19;"And it's funky."
08:19;08:20;"Great rhythm section."
08:20;08:21;"-With a look -Yeah."
08:22;08:26;"It's in a book, a reading rainbow"
08:26;08:30;"I can go anywhere"
08:30;08:31;"It makes me so happy."
08:31;08:34;"-Dance to know what's wrong -Also, because the opening was a cartoon."
08:34;08:36;"-A reading rainbow -Yes, an actual cartoon."
08:36;08:37;"Yeah."
08:37;08:41;"I can be anything"
08:41;08:43;"-You hear that harmony? -Yeah, it's beautiful."
08:43;08:46;"Take a look, it's in a book"
08:46;08:49;"-A reading rainbow -The harmony comes in right here."
08:49;08:52;"-A reading rainbow -A reading rainbow"
08:52;08:54;"-A reading rainbow -A reading rainbow"
08:54;08:56;"-Ah, it's so good. -Oh, and out?"
08:56;08:58;"And that whole song's only 54 seconds."
08:58;09:02;"The only song that has-- that mirrors the intro/outro that well"
09:02;09:05;"is Pastime Paradise with the gong."
09:05;09:07;"-The gong. -I love-- Yeah, I love a symmetrical song."
09:07;09:09;"-Yeah, a symmetrical song. -Symmetrical song."
09:09;09:11;"Let's leave the way we came in this [bleep]"
09:11;09:13;"54 seconds, just a great tune."
09:13;09:15;"In, out, one of the greatest,"
09:15;09:21;"genuinely top five greatest song theme songs of all time."
09:21;09:24;"Jara, you had no idea when you came into Time Crisis today"
09:24;09:25;"that you were gonna actually get on the phone"
09:25;09:28;"with Steve Horlick, composer of Reading Rainbow theme song."
09:28;09:29;"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
09:29;09:31;"Steve Horlick is here?"
09:31;09:33;"You're about to talk to Steve Horlick because when--"
09:33;09:35;"-Come on, man. -You're a friend of the show,"
09:35;09:37;"-so you come by very casually. -Come on, man."
09:37;09:39;"You don't know what we have on tap for the day, so--"
09:39;09:40;"Yeah, I just showed up, and this is--"
09:40;09:44;"I didn't even-- You know, I didn't even know if you were ahead."
09:44;09:45;"I'm a rainbow head, dude."
09:45;09:47;"Okay. This is perfect."
09:47;09:49;"All right, so let's talk to Steve, the composer."
09:49;09:52;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis hotline."
09:52;09:55;"[phone ringing]"
09:55;09:57;"-Hello, Steve? -Hey, hi."
09:57;09:59;"-Steve! -Hey, what's up, Steve?"
09:59;10:00;"This is Ezra on Time Crisis,"
10:00;10:03;"and you're also on with Jarod and Jake."
10:03;10:05;"-Very nice to meet you, Steve. -Hey, guys."
10:05;10:07;"We were just blasting the Reading Rainbow theme song."
10:07;10:10;"This is the second week in a row that we've talked about it"
10:10;10:11;"'cause we're all in agreement here."
10:11;10:12;"It's one of the best,"
10:12;10:14;"not even just children's TV themes of all time,"
10:14;10:17;"one of the best TV themes of all time."
10:17;10:20;"-Of all time, yeah, absolutely. -Oh, geez, you guys are great."
10:20;10:22;"Thanks. I really appreciate that."
10:22;10:24;"So, right off the bat, we have a lot of questions for you."
10:24;10:26;"So, did you compose this front to back?"
10:26;10:27;"Did you do the music? Did you do the lyrics?"
10:27;10:29;"All of the above?"
10:29;10:32;"I did the music and all of the production,"
10:32;10:34;"which at its time was--"
10:34;10:35;"I think people have told me"
10:35;10:39;"it's the first all-electronic theme song ever on TV."
10:39;10:40;"-Oh, really? -I don't know if that's true."
10:40;10:44;"It's definitely the first all-electronic kids' TV theme song."
10:44;10:47;"We found it very striking, that opening synth."
10:47;10:48;"-Yeah. -Are you playing that?"
10:48;10:52;"That opening synth was made on a very rare module"
10:52;10:55;"designed by Donald Buchla,"
10:55;11:00;"who was one of the inventors of the synthesizers back in the '60s."
11:00;11:01;"He only made eight of those modules."
11:01;11:04;"It was called the Multiple Arbitrary Function Generator."
11:04;11:05;"Crazy name, right?"
11:05;11:07;"Things sounded more futuristic back then."
11:07;11:10;"That's such a futuristic-sounding thing."
11:10;11:12;"It's like a Jetsons name for it."
11:12;11:14;"Totally. It was very cool,"
11:14;11:16;"because, you know, sequencers--"
11:16;11:18;"-He invented the sequencer. -Oh, wow."
11:18;11:20;"He also allowed you to randomize a bunch of notes."
11:20;11:22;"I picked a bunch of notes that sounded good to me,"
11:22;11:25;"and I just randomized them and processed them"
11:25;11:26;"and did all kinds of cool stuff,"
11:26;11:31;"and it really became a very important piece of that theme song."
11:31;11:33;"The whole concept of that, by the way,"
11:33;11:34;"was so that what kids would hear it,"
11:34;11:36;"they'd just come running to the TV set."
11:36;11:37;"That's what I wanted to do."
11:37;11:38;"-Oh, yeah. -You can feel that."
11:38;11:41;"-That way it worked. -As soon as you hear that synth--"
11:41;11:42;"Yeah, because the theme builds so well."
11:42;11:44;"-It starts with the synth. -Yeah."
11:44;11:46;"And then the bass and drums kick in, and the vocals,"
11:46;11:47;"and it, like, keeps building."
11:47;11:50;"So, yeah, you have a little time to kind of run over to the TV."
11:50;11:53;"Not bad for 8-bit and mono recording, you know?"
11:53;11:56;"That's a 1980 when-- '81 when that was--"
11:56;11:58;"-Oh, that was '81? -Oh, wow."
11:58;11:59;"'81."
11:59;12:02;"Had you composed other songs prior to that?"
12:02;12:05;"This is just trying to do music for commercials."
12:05;12:06;"That's really why I came to New York."
12:07;12:09;"And to play avant-garde electronic music in all the clubs,"
12:09;12:11;"which I was doing, too."
12:11;12:12;"-Oh, yeah. -It's pretty cool."
12:12;12:14;"Steve, Steve, you gotta go a little deeper on that."
12:14;12:16;"We all lit up. We're like, ""Wait, what?"""
12:16;12:19;"So, you were-- When you say you're playing in the clubs,"
12:19;12:20;"so this is the early '80s New York,"
12:20;12:22;"you're doing avant-garde electronic music."
12:22;12:23;"Like, what type of club?"
12:23;12:26;"Are you crossing paths with, like, the--"
12:26;12:27;"-Arthur Russell? -The punk scene?"
12:27;12:29;"Arthur-- Yeah, what was your milieu in New York?"
12:29;12:32;"We had this band called the Electronic Art Ensemble,"
12:32;12:34;"and we played all over the place."
12:34;12:38;"We played in the kitchen, we played Carnegie Recital Hall."
12:38;12:40;"And basically, we were playing noise"
12:40;12:42;"back when no one was doing noise, right?"
12:42;12:44;"-Mm-hmm. -Kind of ahead of our time."
12:44;12:49;"That's-- So, you're doing this, like, really heady, noisy music."
12:49;12:52;"So, whose idea was it to get somebody like that"
12:52;12:54;"to do the new children's theme song?"
12:54;12:56;"[laughs]"
12:56;12:57;"Well, what happened was is that"
12:57;12:59;"they were creating a pilot for a TV,"
12:59;13:03;"and Dennis Kleiman, who wrote the lyrics, by the way,"
13:03;13:05;"for the Reading Rainbow theme song,"
13:05;13:06;"along with my girlfriend at the time,"
13:06;13:08;"Janet Weir, who is now my wife."
13:08;13:11;"Reading Rainbow, just success stories all around?"
13:11;13:12;"[laughs]"
13:12;13:15;"You know, it came through the grapevine"
13:15;13:16;"that they were doing this pilot."
13:16;13:19;"You know, they were trying to do a TV show for kids."
13:19;13:21;"We heard it was about a rainbow and about reading."
13:21;13:24;"And so, we did a demo, and we were just kids."
13:24;13:26;"I was 26 years old, right?"
13:26;13:28;"And for some reason, they picked ours,"
13:28;13:30;"and that led to a whole career"
13:30;13:33;"writing music for kids' TV, which was really awesome."
13:33;13:37;"So, okay, if I may, when you actually composed it,"
13:37;13:38;"when you're just going in the studio,"
13:38;13:39;"what are you doing?"
13:39;13:42;"Are you getting a little high coming up with this?"
13:42;13:44;"'Cause it's such a great..."
13:44;13:46;"You don't have to answer that, obviously,"
13:46;13:49;"but I really want to know what that vibe was."
13:49;13:52;"'Cause we were just talking about how we love a complete song,"
13:52;13:55;"like, just the same synth that brought it in, took it out,"
13:55;13:57;"and just how layered it is."
13:57;13:59;"But I'm just wondering what that moment was like"
13:59;14:03;"when you actually had the spark for the song."
14:03;14:06;"You know, I think the original sketch, right, on ""Snooper,"""
14:06;14:08;"and I remember that moment really clearly."
14:08;14:11;"We were sitting around a big stunt,"
14:11;14:14;"and Janet and Dennis came up with the line,"
14:14;14:17;"something about a butterfly flying in the sky."
14:17;14:18;"That just turned into a melody,"
14:18;14:20;"and from there, the melody kind of took over,"
14:20;14:22;"and they, you know, we..."
14:22;14:25;"I know the lyrics, you know, ""Our faces high,"""
14:25;14:27;"and we just kept building it from there,"
14:27;14:31;"and it was organic in the way it happened."
14:31;14:32;"At that time in the early '80s,"
14:32;14:36;"I imagine, like, the downtown noise scene,"
14:36;14:38;"lyrics about butterflies in the sky"
14:38;14:41;"must have seemed like some real '60s hippie nonsense."
14:41;14:43;"Did you have mixed feelings about that,"
14:43;14:46;"being, like, a harsh noise musician?"
14:46;14:48;"No, 'cause, you know, I love all kinds of music,"
14:48;14:52;"and having the opportunity to write a song like that"
14:52;14:53;"was really just..."
14:53;14:56;"We just had so much fun composing that thing."
14:56;14:58;"So since then, you've been doing other composing"
14:58;15:00;"for children's shows."
15:00;15:01;"What else have you been up to?"
15:01;15:04;"I still perform live electronic music to this very day."
15:04;15:07;"I do 3D immersive sound concerts."
15:07;15:09;"I did a couple of concerts in Berlin."
15:09;15:11;"I did a couple of concerts in New York,"
15:11;15:14;"and I'm doing that, which is really a lot of fun."
15:14;15:17;"I'm also moving into online education."
15:17;15:20;"I have a partner in a company called ProVideo."
15:20;15:22;"We teach everybody all over the world"
15:22;15:24;"how to use Pro tools and Logic."
15:24;15:27;"-Oh, cool. -How to produce music."
15:27;15:29;"Are you still an analog synth guy?"
15:29;15:31;"I am. Huge Eurorack system."
15:31;15:33;"I love analog, and I love digital,"
15:33;15:36;"but I have a huge Eurorack system"
15:36;15:37;"and two Buchla systems,"
15:37;15:39;"and I'm always doing sound design"
15:39;15:41;"and creating the most crazy stuff."
15:41;15:43;"I'm actually working on an album right now"
15:43;15:45;"with Dream Theater's Jordan Rudess,"
15:45;15:46;"-the keyboard player. -Oh, sick."
15:46;15:48;"-Legit. -He's doing, like, acoustic piano."
15:48;15:51;"I'm doing electronics and the contrast,"
15:51;15:53;"and it's really quite beautiful."
15:53;15:55;"That's amazing. So, Steve, we just got one more"
15:55;15:57;"kind of random question for you,"
15:57;15:58;"just because this is what we were talking about"
15:58;16:01;"before we got into our Reading Rainbow segment."
16:01;16:03;"Are you a Grateful Dead fan?"
16:03;16:05;"[laughs]"
16:05;16:06;"Uh, no."
16:06;16:07;"-Oh! -Fair enough."
16:07;16:11;"-But you said your wife's last name is Weir? -Interesting."
16:11;16:14;"-Oh, yeah, right. -Is she related to Bob?"
16:14;16:18;"No, she's not related to Bob, but that'd be awesome."
16:18;16:21;"-Don't be so sure. -[laughs]"
16:21;16:22;"I'm an amateur genealogist."
16:22;16:24;"I might get back to you with some shocking--"
16:24;16:25;"[laughter]"
16:25;16:27;"I'm waiting for someone to grab a, you know,"
16:27;16:29;"a sample and make a loop out of Reading Rainbow"
16:29;16:31;"and push it into the next universe."
16:31;16:35;"-I think we might be the men for the job. -[laughs]"
16:35;16:36;"-Okay, well-- -I think that would be totally cool, man."
16:36;16:38;"That'd be-- I mean, it still sounds great, man."
16:38;16:40;"-We really love it. -You sound like a deadhead."
16:40;16:41;"You do sound a little like a deadhead."
16:41;16:43;"[laughter]"
16:43;16:45;"-We totally cool, man. -I guess--"
16:45;16:47;"Well, I guess that there's analog synth head"
16:47;16:49;"and deadheads are similar,"
16:49;16:50;"and yet the twain shall never meet."
16:50;16:52;"[laughter]"
16:52;16:53;"The twain have met."
16:53;16:55;"[laughter]"
16:55;16:57;"All right, well, Steve, obviously,"
16:57;16:58;"you get a pass for not liking The Grateful Dead"
16:58;17:00;"'cause you composed the Reading Rainbow theme song"
17:00;17:01;"and you're a sick musician."
17:01;17:03;"Thanks so much for calling in, man."
17:03;17:04;"We really appreciate it."
17:04;17:05;"It was a lot of fun, and thank you for calling."
17:05;17:06;"Appreciate it."

18:22;18:25;"I still think that they were hot when they composed this song."
18:25;18:26;"-Yeah. -But I'm also picturing, like,"
18:26;18:29;"straight-edge noise musician."

18:44;18:46;"So, okay, so, Jrod,"
18:46;18:49;"now you maybe kind of know one or two Grateful Dead songs"
18:49;18:50;"that have been around for the past ten minutes."

18:53;18:55;"-China Cat. Yeah, yeah, China Cat."
18:55;18:57;"-Your China Cat Sunflower. -China Cat Sunflower."
18:57;18:59;"-Back on. -We gotta make a--"
18:59;19:01;"-That's a little China Cat. -Do you care about Game of Thrones?"
19:01;19:05;"I watched the first season, and I loved it,"
19:05;19:06;"and then a dragon egg hatched,"
19:06;19:08;"and I was like, ""This isn't for me."""
19:08;19:10;"-Oh, that's all it took. -That's fair."
19:10;19:12;"I don't do well with sci-fi 'cause it's just like--"
19:12;19:14;"it's like my niece telling me a story."
19:14;19:15;"I'm like, ""Oh, anything can happen."""
19:15;19:17;"-Fantasy. -Fantasy, whatever."
19:17;19:19;"I'm just like, ""Oh, anything can happen."""
19:19;19:20;"-Right. -All right."
19:20;19:22;"We're just making the rules up."
19:22;19:23;"-I hear you. -As we go along."
19:23;19:25;"-Okay. -Fair enough."
19:25;19:27;"-Wait, Jake, do you watch Game of Thrones? -No, I'm not a fan."
19:27;19:29;"-Really? Straight up not a fan. -Not a fan."
19:29;19:32;"So, Steve Horlick to Grateful Dead is you to..."
19:32;19:34;"-GOT. -Yeah, I'm not in."
19:34;19:38;"-Really? Wow. -Are you in?"
19:38;19:39;"Yeah, I'm in."
19:39;19:41;"You watch every episode?"
19:41;19:42;"Yeah, recently."
19:42;19:45;"'Cause it came back on TV, so I was catching up on it."
19:45;19:47;"Oh, I've watched the last two episodes with Hannah."
19:47;19:49;"Oh, really? You're just watching, like, just getting in deep?"
19:49;19:51;"Yeah, I'm on my phone, I'm watching."
19:51;19:53;"Yeah, I'm one of those guys."
19:53;19:55;"I watch, like, the Red Wedding."
19:55;19:57;"I watched, like, the other episode."
19:57;19:58;"You're just a Greatest Hits guy."
19:58;20:00;"Yeah, Greatest Hits. Exactly."
20:00;20:02;"Like, the Grateful Dead, it's my--"
20:02;20:04;"Right, fair enough."
20:04;20:05;"I know the broad strokes."
20:05;20:08;"Okay. Well, clearly I did not gather the right group"
20:08;20:12;"to talk about the connections between Game of Thrones"
20:12;20:14;"and Grateful Dead."
20:14;20:17;"But I was thinking about it,"
20:17;20:20;"because the show's back on TV recently,"
20:20;20:22;"some people are watching it and talking about it."
20:22;20:25;"And I came across a article from 2015"
20:25;20:28;"where George R. R. Martin confirmed"
20:28;20:31;"that there was a Grateful Dead influence on Game of Thrones."
20:31;20:34;"Because he did an interview a couple years ago"
20:34;20:36;"at the 92nd Street Y in New York."
20:36;20:40;"And somebody just randomly asked him, like,"
20:40;20:42;"""Are you a Deadhead?"" This was his answer."
20:42;20:45;"Do your books have any references to the Grateful Dead?"
20:45;20:47;"You call your home ""Terrapin Station,"""
20:47;20:50;"and the song ""Direwolf and Cassidy"" and ""Darkstar"""
20:50;20:52;"have names and references in the books."
20:52;20:55;"(laughter)"
20:55;20:57;"Well, I'm certainly a fan of the Grateful Dead."
20:57;21:01;"I've attended Grateful Dead coverage,"
21:01;21:05;"and my wife Paris is perhaps even more of a fan"
21:05;21:06;"of the Grateful Dead."
21:06;21:10;"And there are a lot of Grateful Dead references"
21:10;21:14;"in my famous rock and roll novel,"
21:14;21:15;"""The Armageddon Rag."""
21:15;21:17;"-Not familiar. -In fact, at one point,"
21:17;21:20;"we were hoping to make a movie of that"
21:20;21:23;"and film the Nosgul concert scenes"
21:23;21:25;"at Grateful Dead concerts."
21:25;21:30;"But, of course, that came to nothing, sad to say."
21:30;21:33;"And I do have Grateful Dead lyrics"
21:33;21:35;"always coming around and rattling around in my head."
21:35;21:39;"""Ripple"" is one of my favorite songs of all time."
21:39;21:41;"""There is a road, no simple highway."""
21:41;21:43;"Oh, man, he speaks like a novelist."
21:43;21:45;"That's actually exactly what you want his voice to sound like."
21:45;21:47;"The dude who wrote ""Game of Thrones."""
21:47;21:49;"But, okay, so..."
21:49;21:51;"I also felt like the answer was ""yeah."""
21:51;21:53;"(laughter)"
21:53;21:54;"That's also an acceptable--"
21:54;21:56;"You like the Grateful Dead? Yeah, they're all right."
21:56;21:57;"Yeah."
21:57;21:59;"Well, he said ""Ripple"" is one of his favorite songs of all time."
21:59;22:01;"""There is a road, no simple highway."""
22:01;22:02;"I guess you could say ""Game of Thrones"""
22:02;22:05;"is a famously complicated show."
22:05;22:06;"Maybe ""Ripple"" encouraged him to do that."
22:06;22:08;"And in ""Game of Thrones,"""
22:08;22:10;"there are things called weirwood trees."
22:10;22:12;"And, yes, they're named after Mr. Bob Weir."
22:12;22:14;"Wow. Oh, that's nice."
22:14;22:17;"Yeah, I mean, there's like a mystical hippie vibe."
22:17;22:19;"Yeah, but-- Not hippie, but like mystical vibe."
22:19;22:21;"You know, I really thought I was gonna get more mileage"
22:21;22:23;"out of this ""Game of Thrones"" Grateful Dead."
22:23;22:26;"Never before have I felt information mean so much"
22:26;22:28;"and yet mean nothing at all."
22:28;22:31;"It's like, I know that there are a lot of people"
22:31;22:33;"that will hear this and go, ""Oh, wow."""
22:33;22:35;"Yeah. And it's just funny looking around a room"
22:35;22:36;"with us just being like, ""Oh, okay."""
22:37;22:39;"Yeah, nobody in this room."
22:39;22:41;"Imagine if when we were on the phone with Steve Horlick,"
22:41;22:43;"composer of the ""Reed and Rainbow"" theme song,"
22:43;22:45;"when I asked him if he liked ""The Grateful Dead,"""
22:45;22:46;"he's like, ""No."""
22:46;22:47;"I'm just like, ""Do you like 'Game of Thrones'?"""
22:47;22:49;"He's like, ""No."""
22:49;22:51;"""Well, listen to this."""
22:51;22:54;"""Well, Steve, I hope you're sitting down."""

26:36;26:38;"So we're just getting started, but we got a real big show today."
26:38;26:40;"We're gonna be digging in the mailbag."
26:40;26:42;"We've been getting so many good listener emails lately."
26:42;26:43;"I know!"
26:43;26:44;"Jake's just getting inundated."
26:44;26:46;"I know, the listeners have been bringing it."
26:46;26:49;"Bringing it all over the world, so we're gonna get into some listener emails later."
26:49;26:50;"Of course, we're gonna do the top five."
26:50;26:53;"We're gonna be comparing it to 1991."
26:53;26:54;"Today."
26:54;26:55;"Okay."
26:55;26:56;"Why '91?"
26:56;26:57;"Don't know."
26:57;26:58;"Nirvana?"
26:58;26:59;"Because that's..."
26:59;27:01;"You say '91, I think Nirvana."
27:01;27:03;"Nope, that was late '91 anyway."
27:03;27:04;"September."
27:04;27:09;"Yeah, that was like September, so that really wasn't popping until '92."
27:09;27:13;"I think Use Your Illusion and Nevermind came out like a week apart."
27:13;27:14;"Yeah, late September."
27:14;27:15;"Yeah."
27:15;27:19;"No, but the reason we're gonna compare it to '91 is because we're talking about George R. R. Martin."
27:19;27:20;"Oh!"
27:20;27:25;"Not a super popular man in the room, but that's the year he started writing A Song of Fire and Ice,"
27:25;27:28;"which is the first Game of Thrones book."
27:28;27:29;"I love it."
27:29;27:31;"Maybe we can get him on the show one day."
27:31;27:32;"That'd be sick."
27:32;27:35;"Because we're having no problem getting crazy guests on Time Crisis."
27:35;27:36;"Let's be real."
27:36;27:38;"Already today we had Gerard."
27:38;27:39;"I mean, he's family."
27:39;27:41;"He's part of the Time Crisis family."
27:41;27:46;"But we had Steve Horlick compose the Reading Rainbow theme song, and we're not even done."
27:46;27:51;"You know, sometimes we do these real mellow shows, just you and me just shooting the ****, riffing."
27:51;27:56;"And then when it rains, it pours, man, because we're not even done with the guests."
27:56;27:59;"Today on Time Crisis, we got R.J. Ritchie."
27:59;28:05;"A lot of people might know him because he's Kid Rock's son, 24-year-old son of Kid Rock."
28:05;28:06;"Wow."
28:06;28:09;"And Kelly South Russell, who Kid Rock first met in eighth grade."
28:09;28:12;"But I don't want to--obviously, like, you know, it's not just about the dad."
28:12;28:14;"He's also a musician in his own right."
28:14;28:15;"He's starting to put out music."
28:15;28:17;"We're going to listen to some of that."
28:17;28:20;"And he's an Apple genius."
28:20;28:21;"Works at the Apple store."
28:21;28:22;"Yeah."
28:22;28:23;"Which city?"
28:23;28:25;"Nashville."
28:25;28:26;"Okay."
28:26;28:27;"I mean, I honestly feel like--"
28:27;28:28;"Okay, I like it."
28:28;28:33;"I don't want to overhype this, but in some ways, R.J. is the perfect Time Crisis guest"
28:33;28:36;"because he makes music."
28:36;28:37;"He's a fellow company man."
28:37;28:39;"He's a fellow company man."
28:39;28:43;"I think we could do this entire interview just asking about what it's like working at the Apple store."
28:43;28:44;"Because that's fascinating."
28:44;28:45;"I've always been intrigued by that."
28:45;28:50;"But then also, his dad's Kid Rock, who's about to--who's claiming he might run for Senate."
28:50;28:51;"Republican Party."
28:52;28:53;"I mean--"
28:53;28:55;"You know, all those, like, Republican rappers."
28:55;28:58;"He's the first, kind of."
28:58;28:59;"First Republican rapper."
28:59;29:04;"So anyway, we've got so much to talk about with R.J., so let's give him a call."
29:04;29:07;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:07;29:10;"[phone ringing]"
29:10;29:12;"Hey, R.J., are you there?"
29:12;29:13;"Yeah, I'm here. What's up?"
29:13;29:14;"Hey, what's up, man?"
29:14;29:15;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
29:15;29:16;"You're on with me, Ezra, and Jake."
29:16;29:17;"What's up?"
29:17;29:18;"Good to meet you guys."
29:18;29:20;"How's it going?"
29:20;29:21;"Not bad."
29:21;29:22;"So where are you calling from?"
29:22;29:23;"Nashville?"
29:23;29:24;"Yeah, Nashville, downtown."
29:24;29:25;"Yeah."
29:25;29:28;"We understand you're also part of the Apple family?"
29:28;29:29;"Yeah, yeah."
29:29;29:32;"I work at the mall here."
29:32;29:34;"At the Apple store in a mall in Nashville?"
29:34;29:35;"Mm-hmm."
29:35;29:36;"Yeah, I'm a genius over there."
29:36;29:40;"I take apart computers and fix them, just as a part-time--"
29:40;29:43;"Okay, yeah, so that's your day job, because also you're a musician making music,"
29:43;29:45;"so this is just your day job right now."
29:45;29:48;"But is that a crazy job?"
29:48;29:53;"I mean, just, like, there's been so many viral videos of people just going nuts at the Genius Bar."
29:53;29:55;"It's insane."
29:55;30:01;"I love the job because of all the people you meet, and just--it's like every day is different,"
30:01;30:06;"and it's just an adventure, and it makes me stay quick on my toes."
30:06;30:09;"It's just one of those jobs where you go in, and the time flies by,"
30:09;30:13;"but, I mean, that store is jam-packed every single day."
30:13;30:18;"And, I mean, you must be catching people at their lowest points, some very low moments."
30:18;30:20;"You probably have to be a therapist sometimes."
30:20;30:26;"Oh, yeah, it's crazy because, you know, I just deal with people every single day who come in,"
30:26;30:28;"and I'm not seeing the happy ones who buy the stuff."
30:28;30:31;"I'm seeing the people who come in and need their stuff fixed."
30:31;30:37;"So every day it's just like, ""Oh, my God, I lost my life, and I got to put it back together."""
30:37;30:40;"Right. Are you getting a lot of tears, tears in the Apple Store?"
30:40;30:42;"Yeah, of course."
30:42;30:45;"I can only imagine. Just brutal."
30:45;30:47;"It's also kind of like being a doctor, I guess."
30:47;30:51;"You have to sometimes deliver the harsh news, just like it couldn't be saved."
30:51;30:56;"Oh, yeah. So many times I'll just walk in, and, you know, I'm working with someone,"
30:56;31:01;"and just have to come back out and be like, ""Hey, you know, this is going to cost like $700 to get fixed."""
31:01;31:07;"It's not like I want to bring that news, but, you know, I feel like a Grim Reaper or something."
31:07;31:09;"I'm like stumbling out, like, ""Oh, God."""
31:09;31:17;"I'm also picturing like the college kid who's got their 30-page essay, and the computer freezes,"
31:17;31:22;"and they're about to lose the credit, and then it's going to ruin their entire life,"
31:22;31:25;"and they're just going to you, their only hope."
31:25;31:31;"Yeah, the best is when you get the girl who comes from college and spilled wine on it three weeks in a row,"
31:31;31:38;"and comes in, spills wine, and I'm like, ""Okay, this is going to cost $755 for you to get it fixed."""
31:38;31:42;"She's like, ""Okay, cool. Yeah, my parents are coming this time. Next week comes in."""
31:42;31:47;"Same exact thing. I'm like, ""What did we not learn? Oh, God."""
31:47;31:54;"You're getting a lot of Vanderbilt sorority and fraternity people coming in with alcohol-related."
31:54;31:55;"Oh, yeah."
31:55;31:59;"And do you like get into the stories with them? Are you like, ""How did this happen, ma'am?"""
31:59;32:03;"Yeah, I won't fix it until they tell me. So that's kind of my thing."
32:03;32:06;"You got to let me know, like, what's going on. Like, how did you do this?"
32:06;32:10;"There's got to be a good story, and if it's not good enough, then you're just going to have to make it up"
32:10;32:14;"because you got to have a good story with something that expensive."
32:14;32:20;"Fair enough. Now, RJ, are you familiar with the infamous ""I was told by AppleCare"" video?"
32:20;32:22;"I don't really remember it."
32:22;32:23;"Jake, do you know about this?"
32:23;32:24;"I don't know it."
32:24;32:27;"So this is a woman. I think she's a mother."
32:27;32:35;"Like, she's in the Apple store, like, pushing a stroller, and she's talking to one of the geniuses at the bar."
32:35;32:40;"It's unclear what the dispute is over, but she says that they're saying, like, ""Ma'am, you need to calm down."""
32:40;32:45;"And she goes, ""I was told by AppleCare,"" and she starts yelling, ""I was told by AppleCare!"""
32:45;32:49;"Like, she's so angry. It looks like she's about to, like, murder somebody."
32:49;32:52;"And she just keeps yelling, ""I was told by AppleCare."""
32:52;32:57;"So, like, we talked about the sad situations. Have you ever just gotten yelled at?"
32:57;33:02;"Oh, yeah. I'd like to say I'm pretty good at calling people down."
33:02;33:10;"That's one of my specialties in there, is, like, if you come at me with a bad tone, or you're freaking out, or you just want, like, your phone fixed or replaced,"
33:10;33:15;"I'm gonna immediately just, like, bring you down to another level and be like, ""Hey, we got two options."
33:15;33:21;"You can either go somewhere else, or I can help you out, and we're gonna be adults about this."""
33:21;33:22;"You seem super chill."
33:22;33:24;"Yeah, you seem like a mellow dude, so."
33:24;33:26;"Yeah, I try to stay that way."
33:26;33:29;"Do you have to address people as, like, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am""?"
33:29;33:31;"Like, if somebody's, like, freaking out, are you just like, ""Sir""?"
33:31;33:36;"""Sir, we both want to fix this iPad."""
33:36;33:38;"We're on the same team here."
33:38;33:43;"""Sir, we're on the same team. Ma'am, it's not my fault you didn't update your iOS for five years."
33:43;33:48;"We're gonna get through this, but Ma'am, I, like, do you use those words, Sir and Ma'am?"""
33:48;33:58;"I don't. We got, like, on our iPads, we got, like, all the information about the person, so I, like, I know what they're wearing, I have their full name and everything."
33:58;34:01;"What do you mean you know what they're wearing?"
34:01;34:04;"What do you mean you know what they're wearing? Like, it says on the iPad, because..."
34:04;34:06;"Yeah, that's how you gotta find people in the store, you know?"
34:06;34:09;"Everyone comes in and they're like, ""Where do we find everyone?"""
34:09;34:12;"It's like, we gotta address you by the clothes that you're wearing."
34:12;34:20;"You got a black T-shirt, you know, blue jeans, whatever, and that's how we find you, 'cause they all just come in, they just stand there, and they're like, ""What do I do?"""
34:20;34:23;"There's no sign, there's no aisle."
34:23;34:24;"Right."
34:24;34:25;"I'm lost."
34:25;34:39;"I was in an Apple store in Pasadena recently, and I hadn't been into a store in years, and someone, you know, there's, like, the greeter in front who took my name, and then I kinda loitered and hung out, and then this dude came out of nowhere."
34:39;34:46;"And this was, like, a super crowded store, there was, like, 80 customers in the store, and this dude made, like, a beeline towards me."
34:46;34:48;"Oh, because the person wrote down what you were wearing."
34:48;34:51;"Yeah, he's wearing, like, a Grateful Dead T-shirt."
34:51;34:57;"A super mellow Caucasian male, approximately 40 years old, Grateful Dead T-shirt."
34:57;34:59;"Is that what it says on the iPad?"
34:59;35:00;"""Reeking of weed."""
35:00;35:01;"No, I'm kidding."
35:01;35:02;"Oh, it's great."
35:02;35:03;"Yeah, it's pretty close."
35:03;35:09;"But I wondered, I was like, how did-- I didn't ask the guy, but I wondered, I was like, ""Why is this guy making a beeline towards me?"""
35:09;35:10;"Boom, now I know."
35:10;35:11;"Now you know."
35:12;35:16;"Well, I'm packing up my game and I'ma head out west, where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts."
35:16;35:23;"Find a nest in the hills, chill like Flint, buy an old drop top, find a spot to pit, then I'm a kid."
35:23;35:28;"Rock it up and down your block, but with a bottle of scotch and watch lights a-crash."
35:28;35:33;"Buy a yacht with a flag, say you're chillin' the most, then rock that shit, platin' down the coast."
35:33;35:39;"Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars, get thrown in the mix and tossed out of bars."
35:39;35:45;"Zip the Tijuana, I want it wrong, find hometown, tell the news and come back home."
35:45;35:51;"Start an escort service for all the right reasons and set up shopping for top of four seasons."
35:51;35:59;"Kid rockin', I'm the real McCoy and I'm headed out west, sucker, because I wanna be a cowboy baby."
35:59;36:03;"With a top left back and the sunshine shinin'."
36:03;36:05;"Cowboy baby."
36:05;36:08;"West coast chillin' with the burnin' twine."
36:08;36:11;"I wanna be a cowboy baby."
36:11;36:14;"Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day."
36:14;36:17;"Cowboy baby."
36:17;36:21;"I just wanna be from a far away."
36:22;36:25;"Okay, so RJ, so your father is Kid Rock."
36:25;36:26;"Mm-hmm, yep."
36:26;36:32;"So you're 24, so that means that you were born like way before Kid Rock was a household name."
36:32;36:36;"So I'm just like curious, like when he started getting really big, how old were you? Do you have memories of it?"
36:36;36:42;"Oh yeah, I remember shooting the ""Only God Knows Why"" video and I was like on his shoulders, super small."
36:42;36:48;"And I remember like sitting in front of the TV like, ""Here's Eminem and then there's my dad on TRL."""
36:48;36:49;"And I thought it was so cool."
36:49;36:52;"So you were right along with him for the ride, taking it all in real time."
36:52;36:59;"Oh yeah, every step. I mean, I went to every show I could and had my big red headphones on."
36:59;37:06;"Oh right, that's the classic look, the child of the musician with like the giant like gardener style."
37:06;37:08;"Oh, like deeply soundproofed?"
37:08;37:11;"Yeah, because you gotta wear those, 'cause you're like a little kid, you can't be so loud."
37:11;37:12;"Right, right."
37:12;37:19;"And I'd be like at his shows playing my Game Boy like in the middle, in the sound booth, in like the middle of the crowd."
37:19;37:21;"And everyone would just be looking at him like, ""What is this kid doing?"""
37:21;37:24;"And then I'd like fall asleep like halfway through."
37:24;37:29;"And I remember being in the studio like playing Mario Kart 64 when it came out."
37:29;37:33;"And like he was just like in there recording every single day."
37:33;37:36;"And he'd be like, ""Bud, just go play some games."""
37:36;37:43;"And you know, it was just kind of a cool time to like see him like work really hard, get to where he's at."
37:43;37:47;"So you followed in his footsteps now that you're kind of beginning a music career."
37:47;37:50;"Obviously your music's pretty different from your dad's in some ways."
37:50;37:53;"Although, you know, over the course of his career, he's like done a lot of different things."
37:53;37:57;"Like do you feel the need to kind of like differentiate yourselves?"
37:57;38:02;"Or like do you see that being the son of Kid Rock, does that influence your music in any way?"
38:02;38:09;"I don't think it influences my music because I've always, always had like a different taste in music than what he's had."
38:09;38:12;"And he's just been like evolving year after year."
38:12;38:19;"And it's kind of weird because I feel like I've stayed in the same place as like Devil Without a Cause."
38:19;38:23;"Like that was just such a good record."
38:23;38:25;"And I remember being like young and didn't really know it."
38:25;38:31;"But when I grew older, like I listened to it and I was like, ""I love this and I love hip hop."""
38:31;38:34;"Then I got more into pop once I started to sing."
38:34;38:38;"And I think that's just kind of where I lie is between those two realms."
38:38;38:46;"So we were just talking about like your memories of kind of like the changes that went through your dad's life as his music career took off."
38:46;38:55;"So one thing that we're curious about is that so now there's these kind of like rumors or this buzz that maybe he's entering yet another phase of his career, which is politics."
38:55;39:03;"So have you been along for the ride so long that having like your dad go from music into politics is like par for the course?"
39:03;39:06;"Or is like this something that you guys talk about?"
39:06;39:11;"I mean, has music prepared you to possibly be like on the periphery of like a political campaign?"
39:11;39:14;"Oh man, that's a big question."
39:14;39:18;"I feel like everything that he's done in his life has kind of been unexpected."
39:18;39:22;"You know, it's not like a written handbook or anything that's followed."
39:22;39:26;"It's really cool to just like see all this unfold."
39:26;39:30;"And I wouldn't put it past him if he did or did not pop into the Senate."
39:30;39:32;"I mean, he kind of weighed the options."
39:32;39:40;"You know, it'd be something personally I think it would be great to like be a part of like that big of a power in like your government."
39:40;39:44;"But at the same time, there's a lot of crap that comes with that."
39:44;39:47;"And I don't know if he will."
39:47;39:48;"I don't know."
39:48;39:49;"Do you follow politics much?"
39:49;39:53;"Like did you this past election, were you like up on it a lot?"
39:53;39:55;"A little bit, not so much."
39:55;40:01;"I kind of have my views and my thoughts, but I just try to stay away from it."
40:01;40:10;"And, you know, I feel like if I'm doing a music career, that's kind of something that I just need to, you know, everyone has opinions."
40:10;40:14;"And so I understand that like when you stand for something, it's great."
40:14;40:16;"But at the same time, you might be dividing people."
40:16;40:26;"And I kind of just want to take my career, I think would just be in a different path of just like, hey, let's focus on maybe not politics."
40:26;40:35;"And I know that's very important, but I kind of want to focus on positivity of like life and helping people out, making good music."
40:35;40:37;"Hey, that's cool if that's what you want to do."
40:37;40:39;"But man, that's not for me."
40:39;40:46;"So we're not going to catch you on Fox News being like so Senator Kid Rock announced a proposal this morning."
40:46;40:48;"RJ, will you please explain this to us?"
40:48;40:51;"Yeah, yeah, I'll just start singing."
40:51;40:57;"I think that's the way, unless you want a full time job as a spokesperson."
40:57;41:00;"I wonder if your dad would cut his hair."
41:00;41:01;"Oh, that's a good question."
41:01;41:05;"If he was running slash elected, that'd be kind of interesting."
41:05;41:09;"The first like goateed long hair, dude."
41:09;41:12;"Yeah, because senators never have long hair."
41:12;41:15;"I don't know if I'd want to see that."
41:15;41:17;"Wait, yeah, in your entire life."
41:17;41:19;"I almost feel like your dad's kind of like Samson."
41:19;41:22;"Like if you cut his hair, he wouldn't be Kid Rock."
41:22;41:25;"Wait, do you have any, has your dad had a buzz cut ever?"
41:25;41:28;"No, he just had the high top fade when he was younger."
41:28;41:30;"I got so many pictures of that."
41:30;41:31;"Right."
41:31;41:32;"The kind of like early hip hop."
41:32;41:34;"So you're almost your entire life."
41:34;41:36;"Your dad had long hair."
41:36;41:40;"First time I heard your dad's music was 1997."
41:40;41:46;"I was in a drive through at Taco Bell in Beaverton, Oregon."
41:46;41:52;"And a buddy of mine threw in a tape and the song was called ""Beep"" in your mouth."
41:52;41:54;"You would have been about four, I guess."
41:54;41:55;"I was surprised."
41:55;41:57;"Because that's deep."
41:57;41:59;"That was still, he wasn't big."
41:59;42:02;"I remember my buddy being like, this is like this white rapper from Michigan."
42:02;42:04;"And I was like, what?"
42:04;42:07;"You're familiar very early."
42:07;42:08;"Oh, yeah."
42:08;42:09;"That's such a funny record."
42:09;42:11;"And he did that at Woodstock."
42:11;42:13;"That's gnarly."
42:13;42:15;"Were you at Woodstock '99, RJ?"
42:15;42:16;"I was so young."
42:16;42:17;"I don't think I was."
42:17;42:19;"If I was there, I don't remember."
42:19;42:21;"Let's hope you weren't."
42:21;42:23;"From what I heard about Woodstock '99."
42:23;42:25;"So RJ, what kind of music do you listen to now?"
42:25;42:29;"Obviously, you grew up with a lot of music around."
42:29;42:31;"Do you have specific tastes now?"
42:31;42:33;"What have you been listening to lately?"
42:33;42:34;"Oh, man."
42:34;42:37;"Yeah, I love pop and hip hop right now."
42:37;42:39;"I'm just immersed in it."
42:39;42:42;"I still listen to Michael Jackson on the regular."
42:42;42:43;"Okay."
42:43;42:44;"Straight up."
42:44;42:45;"At least once a week."
42:45;42:47;"Love my Bruno Mars and some Weekends."
42:47;42:49;"So not a lot of rock and country, it sounds like."
42:49;42:50;"No."
42:50;42:52;"I didn't get hit with that gene."
42:52;42:54;"No Bob Seger?"
42:54;42:56;"I'll jam a little Bob Seger."
42:56;42:58;"There's a couple songs."
42:58;43:00;"[Humming]"
43:00;43:01;"Oh, yeah."
43:01;43:02;"Okay."
43:02;43:03;"I like Bob Seger."
43:03;43:04;"[Laughter]"
43:04;43:06;"But, yeah, I love hip hop."
43:06;43:08;"I like the good rap, though."
43:08;43:16;"And I don't know if I can handle any more of the mumbling and just saying whatever on tracks."
43:16;43:18;"I can't understand you."
43:18;43:23;"I miss just the old school, hardcore rap where people were just spitting."
43:23;43:25;"I love Kendrick's new album."
43:25;43:26;"That was awesome."
43:26;43:28;"Is he one of your favorite rappers now?"
43:28;43:29;"Yeah, for sure."
43:29;43:30;"Cool."
43:30;43:33;"Well, so speaking of music, RJ, we want to play some of your music."
43:33;43:35;"So we were going to play ""Moonlight."""
43:35;43:37;"You want to tell us something about the song?"
43:37;43:44;"I just got the hook for like a year and figured I'd get a girl to sing on it, a close friend, Bailey."
43:44;43:48;"And it's just a fun, upbeat kind of song."
43:48;43:53;"You just want to be outside on a rooftop at night with your girl and just dancing."
43:53;43:54;"Love it."
43:54;43:56;"Well, thanks so much for talking to us, RJ."
43:56;43:57;"We hope you'll call in again."
43:57;43:58;"Yeah."
43:58;44:02;"Anybody who's going to get a broken iPad fixed in the Nashville area, you watch your mouth."
44:02;44:04;"Because those are people, too."
44:04;44:06;"So sir and ma'am, keep it in check."
44:06;44:08;"Awesome having you on."
44:08;44:09;"And here's ""Moonlight."""
44:09;44:10;"Appreciate it."
44:10;44:11;"All right."
44:11;44:12;"Thanks, dude."
44:12;44:13;"Great talking to you."
44:13;44:14;"Bye."
44:14;44:15;"Good talking to you, too."
44:15;44:16;"See you, guys."
44:16;44:35;"and a chemistry has been there forever. My belly time, on repeat, and for every year we'll spend together. You know I can't work with you all night,"
44:35;44:49;"and slow dance by the waist. But I just want you in my arms tight. I wanna groove to the break of day. I find our hearts collide, but why?"

47:51;47:53;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
47:53;47:55;"- One. - One."
47:55;47:57;"- That's RJ Richie with ""Moonlight."""
47:57;47:58;"He's a nice guy."
47:58;47:59;"- Yeah, chill dude."
47:59;48:02;"- We have to point out that on ""Time Crisis,"""
48:02;48:04;"we can never endorse a Republican run for the Senate."
48:04;48:06;"- Absolutely not."
48:06;48:07;"- That's not our values."
48:07;48:07;"That said--"
48:07;48:09;"- I wonder why, well, go ahead."
48:09;48:11;"- I said, we knew that we were gonna talk to RJ."
48:11;48:12;"- Yeah."
48:12;48:14;"- Obviously, the interview should be about him,"
48:14;48:16;"but of course, the Kid Rock Senate"
48:16;48:17;"runs in the background, but it's like--"
48:17;48:18;"- Yeah."
48:18;48:21;"- I didn't wanna put him on the spot to be like,"
48:21;48:24;"yeah, 'cause also like, 'cause that's whack too."
48:24;48:25;"It's like, I think he was kind of gently alluding"
48:25;48:28;"to the fact that like, obviously, he's his own person"
48:28;48:29;"with his own values."
48:29;48:31;"That said, maybe as a follow-up,"
48:31;48:35;"we should get Kid Rock on the show, and we're bringing it."
48:35;48:37;"If you're running for Senate as a Republican,"
48:37;48:38;"we're gonna bring it."
48:38;48:39;"- I'd love to hear his positions."
48:39;48:41;"I mean, it's hard to imagine him being"
48:41;48:45;"super conservative on social issues."
48:45;48:47;"He did write the song ""(beep) Your Mouth."""
48:47;48:49;"- Right."
48:49;48:50;"- Maybe he's one of those guys that's like,"
48:50;48:53;"you know what, I'm a self-made entrepreneur."
48:53;48:56;"I saw like the welfare state destroying people's motivation."
48:56;48:58;"He's like one of those kind of guys."
48:58;48:58;"- I wonder. - I'm curious."
48:58;49:01;"I wonder what his, why Republican."
49:01;49:03;"Maybe he's super Second Amendment."
49:03;49:04;"I don't know."
49:04;49:05;"- You know, I would just hope though,"
49:05;49:08;"if you're like some kind of like badass musician,"
49:08;49:10;"like run as an independent."
49:10;49:11;"You know what I'm saying? - Right."
49:11;49:13;"- Anyway, so Jake, you've been getting"
49:13;49:14;"so many listener emails lately."
49:14;49:15;"- I know."
49:15;49:17;"- We can't possibly get into all of them,"
49:17;49:19;"but we always take a look at just about everyone"
49:19;49:21;"that comes in, so everybody writes in."
49:21;49:23;"We really appreciate it."
49:23;49:25;"Man, we've been getting listener emails from Brazil,"
49:25;49:28;"Germany, Spain, Canada."
49:28;49:29;"- This one's a Zeppelin one."
49:29;49:32;"It kind of ties into, at least in my mind,"
49:32;49:35;"it ties into the Game of Thrones connection."
49:35;49:37;"- Oh yeah, let's, very Game of Thrones vibe."
49:37;49:38;"- Yeah, the lyrics."
49:38;49:39;"- Oh yeah, so yeah, read the email, Jake."
49:39;49:42;"- Okay, this email, Mr. Longstreth,"
49:42;49:44;"sorry to bother you in a personal email,"
49:44;49:47;"but I didn't know how else to contact you."
49:47;49:48;"Being an avid Time Crisis listener,"
49:48;49:50;"this email is bugging me for some time"
49:50;49:52;"and I had to get it off my chest."
49:53;49:56;"My name is Dipnashu Gupta,"
49:56;49:59;"nevermind if you can't pronounce it right,"
49:59;50:02;"and I'm a physics master's from India,"
50:02;50:04;"but currently living in Germany."
50:04;50:05;"- Okay."
50:05;50:06;"- I don't know what physics master's is."
50:06;50:08;"Maybe like a master's degree in physics."
50:08;50:11;"- Yeah, you could say, ""Oh my God, I'm a physics master's."""
50:11;50:13;"Like, ""I'm a physics PhD."""
50:13;50:15;"- Oh, okay, okay, I got you."
50:15;50:17;"I feel like this show sorely lacks"
50:17;50:20;"a non-American perspective and taste on music,"
50:20;50:21;"and someone who's never been in America"
50:21;50:24;"more than a childhood vacation to Disneyland,"
50:24;50:25;"here's my story."
50:25;50:28;"Being an outsider from all pop culture phenomena"
50:28;50:30;"that pervades through your country,"
50:30;50:32;"I've had a unique introduction to music."
50:32;50:35;"I didn't even listen to my first international track"
50:35;50:38;"before I was in the 10th grade, 15 years of age."
50:38;50:41;"My initial listening encompassed pop hits of the day,"
50:41;50:44;"breezy new metal bands like Linkin Park,"
50:44;50:47;"and commercial rap acts like Eminem."
50:47;50:49;"Wouldn't describe Linkin Park as breezy,"
50:49;50:52;"but not gonna nitpick."
50:52;50:55;"It remained this way until one fine day"
50:55;50:57;"I saw a cover by Miley Cyrus of an eclectic"
50:57;51:00;"and intriguing song called ""Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You."""
51:00;51:02;"And I was like, ""Wow, what is that?"
51:02;51:04;"I've never heard anything like that."""
51:04;51:07;"A bit of digging led to, pun intended,"
51:07;51:10;"me to discover the Led Zeppelin ""One"" album,"
51:10;51:14;"and its vibrant rock song left a deep impression on me."
51:14;51:15;"I had heard ""Stairway"" before,"
51:15;51:17;"but it did not influence me in a major way."
51:17;51:21;"The guitar riffs were so soulful and loud at the same time."
51:21;51:24;"I went through a rite of passage, one album after another."
51:24;51:26;"Each album holds something special for me."
51:26;51:29;"I could ramble on, another pun,"
51:29;51:33;"about how this led me to discover other great artists"
51:33;51:35;"like the Beatles, Van Morrison, and The Who,"
51:35;51:37;"being prominent ones."
51:37;51:40;"But I'd like to cut to the chase here."
51:40;51:43;"You speak so much about the tasteful palette of 70s rock,"
51:43;51:45;"but why don't you ever talk about Led Zeppelin?"
51:45;51:49;"They were inarguably, yes, not even inarguably,"
51:49;51:51;"the band that defined the decade"
51:51;51:54;"and influenced music to come for generations."
51:54;51:56;"Soulful sitar tracks, done."
51:56;52:00;"Loudest riffs you'll ever hear, done."
52:00;52:01;"Brilliant songwriting"
52:01;52:03;"and the second greatest guitarist of all time,"
52:03;52:05;"can't forget about Jimi Hendrix."
52:05;52:09;"Churning out epic solos out of the back of his hand, check."
52:09;52:11;"Yes, the show is on the lighter side of things"
52:11;52:14;"with all the fun things in life, Curb and Seinfeld."
52:14;52:17;"It just plain disheartens me to see the greatest band"
52:17;52:18;"of all time go unmentioned"
52:18;52:20;"every time we talk about 70s rock."
52:20;52:22;"Maybe it's too much to ask,"
52:22;52:24;"but can we have an episode"
52:24;52:25;"where you guys talk about Led Zeppelin?"
52:25;52:27;"(laughing)"
52:27;52:28;"- Great email."
52:28;52:30;"- Wow. - That was a tour de force."
52:30;52:34;"- I love someone going to bat for Zeppelin."
52:34;52:35;"- I know. - As if it's like"
52:35;52:37;"some obscure band, like."
52:37;52:38;"- I mean, he's right, though. - You know what?"
52:38;52:40;"Unsung heroes, Led Zeppelin."
52:40;52:42;"- We talk so much about 70s rock on this show,"
52:42;52:44;"we almost never talk about Zeppelin."
52:44;52:46;"- I gotta say, it's also like, you know,"
52:46;52:50;"it's a good story to remember perspective, too."
52:50;52:51;"- Right."
52:51;52:54;"- Like, you grow up in America."
52:54;52:56;"- Yeah, classic rock radio."
52:56;52:58;"- If you listen to classic rock radio,"
52:58;53:01;"if your parents listen to that type of music,"
53:01;53:03;"which is a very large percentage of the country,"
53:03;53:05;"you're just familiar, you at least know the name Led Zeppelin."
53:05;53:08;"Even via hip hop, Led Zeppelin gets sampled a lot."
53:08;53:09;"It's just part, you know, whatever,"
53:09;53:11;"they were big in America."
53:11;53:12;"And it's kind of amazing to like remember"
53:12;53:16;"that this dude, growing up in a different culture,"
53:16;53:17;"he's saying he didn't even hear anything"
53:17;53:20;"outside of Indian music until he was 15."
53:20;53:21;"- Right."
53:21;53:23;"- That for him, you know, by like,"
53:23;53:26;"kind of guitar store, like, rock dude vibe,"
53:26;53:29;"it's like to get into Zeppelin off of Miley Cyrus cover"
53:29;53:30;"is like, what?"
53:30;53:33;"And then it's like, well, yeah, check yourself, man."
53:33;53:36;"Not everybody like, grew up with Led Zeppelin"
53:36;53:39;"blasting on like, on Runnin' With the Big Dog radio."
53:39;53:41;"- Yeah, or like, not everyone had the like,"
53:41;53:44;"kid that was like, four years older than you,"
53:44;53:45;"that lived down the street."
53:45;53:46;"- Like a stoner older brother."
53:46;53:48;"- That was like, houses of the holy dude."
53:48;53:49;"- You gotta listen to this."
53:49;53:50;"In fact-- - That's the record."
53:50;53:54;"- I'll even go as far to say that our guy--"
53:54;53:55;"- Dibnashu."
53:55;53:58;"- Dibnashu, he's got better taste"
53:58;54:02;"than your average, rando, punk ass kid"
54:02;54:04;"who's into Zeppelin in like, the late 80s"
54:04;54:06;"because he heard through--"
54:06;54:08;"- Miley. - Miley."
54:08;54:09;"He was like, that's a good song."
54:09;54:10;"- Yep."
54:10;54:10;"- I honestly think that--"
54:10;54:12;"- He's got better songwriting."
54:12;54:14;"- He was like, that's a good song,"
54:14;54:16;"and he got into it, like, if you were growing up"
54:16;54:18;"in America and you're at some high school"
54:18;54:20;"where, yeah, an older kid was into Zeppelin or something,"
54:20;54:23;"you'd already be so contextualized by the fact"
54:23;54:27;"that you thought rock is cool,"
54:27;54:27;"or you thought Jimmy Paid,"
54:27;54:30;"you'd have so many other signifiers to get into Zeppelin."
54:30;54:33;"- He's hearing it on like, a purely musical level."
54:33;54:36;"- I mean, he should probably be an A&R guy."
54:36;54:38;"- Divorced from cultural context."
54:38;54:40;"- You just imagine like, you hear Miley Cyrus"
54:40;54:41;"sing a Zeppelin tune, just be like,"
54:41;54:42;"now that's a song. - Babe."
54:42;54:44;"- That's a song, find me who wrote that song,"
54:44;54:45;"I wanna sign these guys."
54:45;54:46;"- Page Plant, who's that?"
54:46;54:48;"- Page Plant, get him in my office."
54:48;54:50;"These fellas can write a tune."

59:00;59:02;"I'm definitely not a poser."
59:02;59:04;"When I say that I like Zeppelin,"
59:04;59:06;"I can name minimum 10 songs."
59:06;59:07;"- Oh, really?"
59:07;59:09;"Can you cue up ""Song Remains the Same""?"
59:12;59:13;"- I like Zeppelin."
59:13;59:14;"There's so many songs."
59:14;59:17;"- This to me is like truly beyond genre."
59:17;59:18;"It's like,"
59:18;59:20;"no, it's like this jangly 12-string."
59:20;59:21;"- Right, they're great."
59:24;59:31;"- This song is to me one of my favorites."
59:31;59:35;"First track, ""House of the Holy"", '73."
59:35;59:37;"- I didn't grow up in a Led Zeppelin household at all."
59:37;59:38;"- Oh, neither did I."
59:38;59:39;"My parents are out with Zeppelin."
59:39;59:42;"They love the dead, out with Zeppelin."
59:42;59:44;"Deeply out."
59:44;59:46;"- I don't think my parents like the dead or Zeppelin."
59:49;59:52;"- No, I got into this like an older kid's neighborhood."
59:52;59:53;"- It's cool."
59:53;59:55;"You know what my favorite Zeppelin song is though?"
59:55;59:56;"- What's that?"
59:59;59:59;"- ""Dyre Maker""."
59:59;01:00:01;"- Yeah, yeah, same record, ""House of the Holy""."
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- I love reggae."
01:00:02;01:00:05;"I'm a reggae guy."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- Sure."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"- I like when Led Zeppelin got ""Tropical"","
01:00:07;01:00:09;"which I think they did twice."
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- Oh, ""Fool in the Rain""."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"- ""Fool in the Rain"", the other one, yeah."
01:00:11;01:00:15;"- Which is one of the greatest page guitar solos."
01:00:17;01:00:34;"- Yeah, it's funny."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Zeppelin, I deeply respect them."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I love hearing some of their music."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"I don't know why, they just never,"
01:00:40;01:00:43;"I never got explored their catalog"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"in the way that like the Rolling Stones."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"- Wow."
01:00:45;01:00:48;"- Enticed me or Bob Dylan."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"I don't know, but I know."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"- I feel like they're underrated in terms of like,"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"how every album was so different."
01:00:54;01:00:57;"Like the Stones and Dylan, like in the Beatles,"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"every album was a different journey."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Zeppelin was the same way."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"- Yeah."
01:01:02;01:01:04;"- And I don't feel like they get the props for that."

01:02:25;01:02:26;"- It's only a couple songs."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"- It's only a couple songs."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Okay, first of all, I agree with the fan who wrote in,"
01:02:30;01:02:34;"Zeppelin unequivocally is one of the best rock bands"

01:02:52;01:02:53;"- Also, yeah, I like this,"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"'cause it's always got sampled in rap songs."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- Oh, yeah, dude, Levy."
01:02:58;01:02:58;"- Yeah."
01:03:01;01:03:03;"I think they might even use a little bit of that"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"in 99 Problems."
01:03:04;01:03:07;"That's like a super heavily sampled break."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Oh."
01:03:09;01:03:11;"Led Zeppelin."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Oh."
01:03:14;01:03:17;"Great musicians, I mean."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I guess I feel about--"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"- You don't quite connect."
01:03:19;01:03:20;"- Yeah, it's like--"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"- Maybe a little too heavy, or?"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"- You know what, it's like,"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"I feel a way about Led Zeppelin"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"that you feel about Game of Thrones."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- Okay, all ears."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"- Obviously very similar."
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- Well."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- Similar setting."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"- Not really."
01:03:33;01:03:38;"- A lot of English people talking about hills and Gollum."
01:03:38;01:03:40;"Just for me, I guess the reason that I prefer"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"Game of Thrones to Led Zeppelin is"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"probably because Game of Thrones is a TV show."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"The narrative just sucks me in more,"
01:03:48;01:03:50;"and with HBO Go, I can just go back"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"and watch an entire season."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Whereas with Led Zeppelin, there's music,"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"but there's no visuals."
01:03:55;01:03:57;"And there's not exactly characters."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"- Jon Bonham's not a character."
01:03:59;01:04:00;"- I guess he's a character, but--"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"- Get out of here, dude."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- There is--"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- He's not a character?"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"- Get out of here."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"- Well, they're not like a Tyrion Lannister,"
01:04:06;01:04:09;"a Daenerys Targaryen."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"I will say, though, that Led Zeppelin,"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"isn't it weird how sometimes in bands,"
01:04:13;01:04:17;"like the names, there's destiny"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"built into the people's names?"
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Of all the dudes from the '60s,"

01:04:35;01:04:36;"There's already something about that"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"that sounds like mystical."
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- Page and Plant."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"- Page and Plant."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- I'm gonna make a playlist."
01:04:42;01:04:45;"No stuff you'd hear on classic rock radio."

01:04:46;01:04:47;"- No stairway?"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"- No, no stairway, of course not."

01:04:59;01:05:00;"Right for you, which album it's on."
01:05:00;01:05:02;"This is definitely a Led Zeppelin song."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"- This is Puffy?"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"Yeah."
01:05:09;01:05:11;"- This is Led Zeppelin featuring Puff Daddy."
01:05:11;01:05:13;"- God."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"I love the thing about Robert Plant hearing this"

01:05:24;01:05:27;"- Yeah, Robert Plant's like, ""Oh, God."""
01:05:27;01:05:28;"Maybe he liked it."
01:05:28;01:05:29;"Maybe he was..."
01:05:32;01:05:41;"Anyway, that was Puff Daddy."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Come with me from the Godzilla."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"- That sounded awful."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"- That's from the Godzilla soundtrack in the late '90s."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"- God, oh my God."
01:05:48;01:05:51;"Not even on a proper Puff album."
01:05:51;01:05:55;"Just like, ""Oh, dude, we got this"

01:06:04;01:06:05;"- Oh, I'm sure."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"- I bet his answer would be like,"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"""You know how much money I made off that song?"""
01:06:08;01:06:09;"- They found Jimmy Page."
01:06:09;01:06:11;"They just happened to call him at sort of like a weird"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"kind of transitional moment."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"- Right."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"- And Page was just like, ""Ugh, okay."""

01:06:28;01:06:30;"- I can set her right."
01:06:30;01:06:36;"- I invested way too much money"

01:09:19;01:09:20;"Like I remember a few years ago,"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"somebody was like, ""What do you think of rap?"""
01:09:22;01:09:23;"He's like, ""It's crap."""
01:09:23;01:09:23;"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:09:23;01:09:26;"- He's like, ""Oh my God, dude."""
01:09:26;01:09:28;"And then like--"
01:09:28;01:09:31;"- He's like, ""That Kanye seems like a real dolt."""
01:09:31;01:09:31;"- Did he say that?"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"- He's like that kind of stuff."
01:09:33;01:09:37;"Don't quote me on that, but it's like basically the premise."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"- And then like--"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"- Well, Obama said that too."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"- Obama said Kanye was a jackass."
01:09:42;01:09:45;"But then David Crosby also, but you know,"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"he's also, he talks too much (beep)"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"so like, okay, you're like an old white rock star."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"You can get away with still saying"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"that dumb rap is crap stuff"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"because probably you got some other old white rock star"
01:09:56;01:09:59;"being like, ""Hey, Crosby, I agree with you."
01:09:59;01:10:01;"""They don't do it like they did back in our day, huh?"""
01:10:01;01:10:02;"Yeah, man."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"But he's also shot himself in the foot"
01:10:05;01:10:09;"because infamously, obviously this Crosby still is a Nash,"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"but even better, Crosby still is Nash and Young."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"- Yeah."
01:10:13;01:10:16;"- And Neil Young, arguably, not inarguably,"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"the biggest of the four."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"- By far."
01:10:19;01:10:20;"(laughing)"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"- And that's no shade on Crosby, Stills, or Nash."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"- No, Stills wrote great songs."
01:10:26;01:10:28;"Nash wrote great songs."
01:10:28;01:10:29;"Crosby?"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"- Crosby's probably the weakest songwriter of the four."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- Oh, by far."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"His first solo album--"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"(laughing)"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- Okay, he's getting fired up."
01:10:36;01:10:39;"- His first solo album is called"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"If I Could Only Remember My Name."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"- I've heard that record."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"- And it's a good record,"
01:10:43;01:10:46;"but it's only because Joni's on it, Jerry's on it,"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"Neil is on it."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"- Right, I mean, yeah, Crosby--"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"- Crosby, in terms of songwriting, is a complete hack."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"(explosion)"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"(laughing)"
01:10:55;01:10:56;"He's a great musician."
01:10:56;01:10:57;"- Shots fired."
01:10:57;01:10:57;"- No, no, no, no."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"He was there at the right place, right time,"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"got in these great bands, great musician."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Not a songwriter."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"So that's, of all the guys to be like,"
01:11:06;01:11:09;"throwing shade on Twitter in 2017."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"- He's gotta get the least credit."
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- It's like, come on, bro."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"- And obviously, the other guys are great,"
01:11:13;01:11:14;"and together they did great stuff,"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"but yeah, far and away, Neil Young"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"just kind of had the most influential solo career."
01:11:19;01:11:23;"So I've been told that when they tour"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"as Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young,"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"now we're talking arenas."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:11:27;01:11:32;"Now we're talking pay for daughter's divorce situation."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"- Didn't come here for the politics."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"(laughing)"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"- So if you're Crosby, one would think"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"that you wanna be on good terms with Neil Young."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"And look, we don't know any of these guys."
01:11:44;01:11:44;"There might be more to it."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"- I think that ship has sailed."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"- But so this is like recently."
01:11:48;01:11:51;"A few years ago, Neil Young, I guess,"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"and his wife broke up, and he started dating"
01:11:53;01:11:54;"the actress Daryl Hannah."
01:11:54;01:11:59;"And Crosby started publicly running his mouth about it."
01:11:59;01:12:01;"I gotta look up exactly what he said."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"It's something like gnarly."
01:12:02;01:12:05;"- Crosby's on his deck in Malibu,"
01:12:05;01:12:07;"been sober forever, just bored."
01:12:07;01:12:08;"- So this is like--"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"- Running his mouth on Twitter."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"- So Neil Young and his wife get divorced."
01:12:12;01:12:15;"Whatever, they've been together a long time."
01:12:15;01:12:16;"That's brutal."
01:12:16;01:12:19;"I'm sure that's very painful for both of them."
01:12:19;01:12:19;"But again--"
01:12:19;01:12:21;"- Who knows what's going on in a relationship?"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"- It's their private business, man."
01:12:23;01:12:28;"And then old Crosby scores an interview"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"with the Idaho Statesman."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"I mean, God."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"- That's a big get for Crosby."
01:12:33;01:12:35;"- And he starts talking about,"
01:12:37;01:12:40;"he starts talking about Neil Young's new girlfriend,"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"rumored to be actress Daryl Hannah."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"So he's talking about the previous marriage,"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"and Crosby said, ""37 years, that's a freaking miracle."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"""And I just don't feel the urge to go try something new."
01:12:49;01:12:51;"""And I happen to know that he's hanging out with somebody"
01:12:51;01:12:55;"""that's a purely poisonous predator now, and that's karma."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"""He's gonna get hurt, but I understand why it happened."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"""I'm just sad about it."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"""I'm always sad when I see love get tossed in the gutter."""
01:13:03;01:13:05;"Imagine that you're just Neil Young."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"I bet he probably texts with Stills and Nash every now"
01:13:08;01:13:09;"and then."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"Crosby is kind of like, ""See you every few years."""
01:13:12;01:13:14;"There's probably always talk about,"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"""Should we get together and do another tour?"""
01:13:15;01:13:17;"And then you go through this incredibly painful thing."
01:13:17;01:13:19;"You and your wife get divorced,"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"and then you crack open the Idaho Statesman."
01:13:21;01:13:22;"- This guy you've known for 50 years."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"- Yeah, just out of nowhere."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"He probably doesn't even know."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"He just starts calling your new girl, like, ""Why?"""
01:13:29;01:13:30;"- I know."

01:15:33;01:15:38;"- Yeah, so anyway, that's the full context"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"for Crosby just getting asked questions,"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"just being like, later Crosby had to publicly apologize,"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"even for Crosby."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"- He had to?"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"Who made him?"
01:15:48;01:15:48;"What?"
01:15:48;01:15:51;"Who in like the David Crosby PR universe"
01:15:51;01:15:54;"is like laying down the law with him,"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"being like, you gotta apologize, man."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Neil is just irate."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"- Maybe it was Stills or Nash."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"These guys got a lot of drama."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"Last year, Nash did an interview and said,"
01:16:03;01:16:04;"I don't like David Crosby right now."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"He's been awful for me the last two years,"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"just (beep) awful."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"I've been there and saved his (beep) ass for 45 years"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"and he treats me like (beep)."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- These guys are so old."
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- You can't do that to me."
01:16:13;01:16:17;"- Why are they, it's like, it's such a bummer."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"- I mean-- - You think that people"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"like mellow out into like wise old men"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"and it's like, nope."
01:16:22;01:16:25;"- I gotta say, almost any time, not to name names,"
01:16:25;01:16:29;"I've been around like older rock stars,"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"it just gave me no hope."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"- I'm psyched for you and like Baio"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"to be publicly bickering in like 38 years."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"- No, that's my worst nightmare."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"I mean, that's the thing, like--"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"- It's just like, dude, you and me publicly bickering."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"- Just like the time crisis."
01:16:43;01:16:47;"- They hosted a show together for 18 years."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"- Just like-- - It ended."
01:16:49;01:16:52;"- Just like tweeting to nobody in particular,"
01:16:52;01:16:55;"just like, I'm not a fan of (beep) Jake Longstreet,"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"so if you think there's gonna be a time crisis reunion,"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"keep dreaming."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"One retweet, three faves."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"Just like on my porch."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"- 9.40 a.m."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"- Oh man."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"No, yeah, I'm just saying like,"
01:17:09;01:17:12;"it's always really brutal when you see like older people"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"who are still like super petty."
01:17:14;01:17:15;"We all hope that as we get older,"
01:17:15;01:17:18;"like your priorities become straight,"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"like you just like spend time with the right people,"
01:17:21;01:17:22;"life becomes more chill,"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"you focus on the important things."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"- You gain some wisdom."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"- Yeah, such as like,"
01:17:27;01:17:31;"such as there's no point in like publicly"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"just like getting into it with somebody"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"you probably don't even talk to that much anymore."
01:17:35;01:17:36;"This is hilarious, this turned into"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"Crosby, Stills, and Nash time."
01:17:38;01:17:42;"And also, clearly, Stills and Nash, like poor guys."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Neil Young's off on his own trip"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"and they're having to clean up Crosby's mess."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"- And if by any chance,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"there's anybody listening to Time Crisis right now"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"who's not familiar with Crosby, Stills, and Nash,"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"so we're just like talking about these random old guys"
01:17:55;01:17:57;"who hate each other and talk (beep)"
01:17:57;01:18:00;"about each other publicly when they should be chilled out."
01:18:00;01:18:01;"- Helplessly hoping?"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"Like examples of great harmonies?"
01:18:04;01:18:05;"- Like these are guys with beautiful voices"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"whose music used to sound like this."

01:18:17;01:18:20;"But also it's like,"
01:18:20;01:18:23;"imagine you've been in this band with a guy like Crosby,"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"clearly a (beep) talker."
01:18:25;01:18:26;"- Yeah."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"- He's even got to talk about Neil Young's girlfriend."

01:20:37;01:20:42;"And now"
01:20:42;01:20:46;"I'll light the fire"
01:20:46;01:20:52;"While you place the flowers in the vase"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"That you bought"
01:20:55;01:20:59;"Today"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"Oh come on Crosby, get it together man"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"But yeah, on Twitter always people ask some questions"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"What do you think of Jim Morrison?"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"Overrated"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"Never liked him"
01:21:10;01:21:11;"Never liked him"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Yeah that's funny, that's a pretty tight take actually"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"Right"
01:21:14;01:21:19;"It's also like hilarious, it's like 50 years later just talking s*** about one of your peers who died at 27"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"So long ago"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"He sucked"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"Is it time for the top 5?"
01:21:25;01:21:26;"Yeah"
01:21:26;01:21:29;"It's time for the top 5"
01:21:29;01:21:32;"5 on iTunes"
01:21:32;01:21:38;"Alright Jake, today we're comparing the top 5 songs on iTunes to the top 5 Billboard hits of 1991"
01:21:38;01:21:42;"The year that George R.R. Martin started writing Fire and Ice"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"So late July '91"
01:21:45;01:21:50;"Late July '91, George R.R. Martin sits down at his word processor"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"Blasting some Grateful Dead"
01:21:52;01:21:56;"And begins writing a book that will become a TV show"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"That will change the world"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"25 years later"
01:21:59;01:22:01;"The number 5 song of '91 this week"
01:22:01;01:22:04;"Paula Abdul - Rush Rush"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"Good song"
01:22:06;01:22:09;"Paula Abdul - Rush Rush"
01:22:09;01:22:23;"I don't know if you know this song"
01:22:23;01:22:25;"Oh yeah, it's a good one"
01:22:25;01:22:33;"Paula is sort of like pre-Britney with her vocal fry"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Uh, yeah"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"Yeah, you're right"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"What?"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"Yeah"
01:22:40;01:22:44;"Push, push"
01:22:44;01:22:47;"Not quite full voice"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"Right, right, right"
01:22:50;01:22:58;"A lot of other R&B singers would probably be belting this a little more"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"Right, she's not singing loud"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"Confidently, yeah"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"Push, push"
01:23:02;01:23:05;"Push, push"
01:23:05;01:23:17;"This is the big ballad off the Forever You're A Girl album"
01:23:17;01:23:19;"You're a Paula Abdul fan, huh?"
01:23:19;01:23:21;"Yeah, well it's right, perfect timing for me"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"I mean I was watching a lot of MTV at that point"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"Right"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"And Forever You're A Girl and Straight Up were like big hits"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"Straight Up, Mav Timmy"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"Yeah, yeah, and also Offices of Tract"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"With the cartoon, she danced with the cat in the video"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"So the Forever You're A Girl album was like a"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"She did like a bunch of singles off that record"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"Yeah, she was a great dancer"
01:23:38;01:23:39;"Former Laker girl"
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Right"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"Soft spot in my heart for those singles"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"Forever You're A Girl is a great album title"
01:23:45;01:23:47;"Great song"
01:23:47;01:23:56;"What year was she born?"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Paula Abdul was born in 1962"
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Okay, so she was 29 here?"
01:24:01;01:24:05;"So, oh, Paula Abdul is a Syrian Jew"
01:24:05;01:24:06;"I didn't know that"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"I wonder if she's still in LA, like what's her scene?"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Oh yeah, she's definitely still in LA"
01:24:10;01:24:11;"Like, what's her day to day?"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"You know who else is a Syrian Jew is Jerry Seinfeld"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"Oh, really?"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"You can trace some of his heritage back to Syria"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"When's he gonna weigh in?"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"We should have Paula call in"
01:24:21;01:24:22;"Let's have Paula call in"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"Paula, what's your day to day?"
01:24:23;01:24:25;"She went to Van Nuys High School"
01:24:25;01:24:27;"I didn't know she was on like American Idol for a while and stuff"
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Oh, that's right"
01:24:28;01:24:31;"I love that Jake's got a soft spot for Paula Abdul"
01:24:31;01:24:33;"What about the number 5 today?"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"Shawn Mendes, the Caucasian Canadian"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Oh yeah"
01:24:36;01:24:40;"Canada's second most famous Caucasian"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"Very passionate music"
01:24:42;01:24:49;"Is that the same song we heard last week?"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"I think so, yeah"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"There's nothing holding me back"
01:24:55;01:24:58;"Cause every time that she gets close, yeah"
01:24:58;01:25:04;"She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing"
01:25:04;01:25:11;"And maybe I should stop and start confessing"
01:25:11;01:25:12;"Pretty jolly"
01:25:12;01:25:14;"Confessing, yeah"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"Oh, I've been shaking"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"I love it when you go crazy"
01:25:18;01:25:20;"You take all my inhibitions"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"Baby, there's nothing holding me back"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"You like that, right?"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"You take all my inhibitions"
01:25:25;01:25:26;"Just the hand claps"
01:25:26;01:25:30;"My inhibitions"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"That's pretty rock"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"Yeah"
01:25:33;01:25:35;"What, Canadians can't make rock?"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"I didn't say that"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"The number 4 song"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"I gotta know, is it Shawn Mendes?"
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Yeah, that sucks"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Oh, I wasn't gonna say that"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"It sucks"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Okay"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Jury's out"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Oh, this is a good song"
01:25:47;01:25:50;"The number 4 song in Summer '91"
01:25:50;01:25:53;"DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, ""Summertime"""
01:25:53;01:25:54;"Rounds, please"
01:25:54;01:26:02;"Song sample is ""Summer Madness"" by Kool & The Gang"
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Great song"
01:26:17;01:26:20;"Here it is, a groove, slightly transformed"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"Just a bit of a break from the norm"
01:26:22;01:26:25;"Just a little something to break the monotony"
01:26:25;01:26:26;"Of all that hardcore dance"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"That has gotten to be a little bit out of control"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"I feel like Will Smith"
01:26:31;01:26:33;"He certainly did invent this flow"
01:26:33;01:26:40;"What was the last big Will Smith hit?"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"Like a true hit?"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Yeah"
01:26:42;01:26:45;"I don't know"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"Here come the men in black"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Here come the men in black"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"Like that kind of era"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Oh, yeah, yeah"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Late 90s"
01:26:54;01:27:02;"So that was probably '99, yeah"
01:27:02;01:27:05;"You know, you can't say anything bad about Summertime"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"No"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"The number 4 song"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"In our era, 2017"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Charlie Puth"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"What's going on last time?"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"Yeah, now I remember"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"Charlie Puth"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"That name is funny"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"What's funny about it?"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"You know, man, you keep implying that the name Charlie Puth is funny"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"What's actually, what's funny about it?"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"It's not like it sounds like anything"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"No, it doesn't, right? Does it?"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Not really"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"What?"
01:27:32;01:27:33;"Putheads"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"His fans are called Puthenators"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"That's cool"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"That's so dumb"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Why is that dumb?"
01:27:38;01:27:39;"It's the worst"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Why?"
01:27:40;01:27:43;"It's a dumb pun on Terminator"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"That's dumb"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"But was Deadhead dumb?"
01:27:46;01:27:47;"Deadhead's original"
01:27:47;01:27:48;"What's original about it?"
01:27:48;01:27:50;"There wasn't Buddy Hollyheads"
01:27:50;01:27:51;"There wasn't Beatlesheads"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Deadheads"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"It rhymes"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"Deadheads"
01:27:54;01:27:56;"It's like, you know"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"That's where the term head comes from"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Is it really?"
01:27:59;01:28:00;"It didn't exist before?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"Are you sure?"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"No, I'm not sure"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"I bet it existed before Deadheads"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"I don't think so, dude"
01:28:06;01:28:09;"What, piehead?"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Yeah, jazz musicians"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"Okay, whatever, man"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"I'm just saying, like, so Deadhead"
01:28:13;01:28:14;"Okay, but"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"Deadhead is cool because it rhymes"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"But Puthenators is dumb because it's a pun"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"So I just want to understand"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"In Jake's world view"
01:28:21;01:28:22;"Yeah"
01:28:22;01:28:23;"Rhyming is cool"
01:28:23;01:28:24;"Puns suck"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"That's not what I'm saying"
01:28:25;01:28:28;"Deadhead was created"
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Whole cloth"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"Maybe it came from pothead"
01:28:30;01:28:33;"But they took it from a drug context"
01:28:33;01:28:34;"To a band context"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"Taking it from, like, a bad 80s action movie"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"To a band pun"
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Weak"
01:28:38;01:28:40;"Weak"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"You follow my logic"
01:28:41;01:28:43;"First of all, Terminator is a good movie"
01:28:43;01:28:44;"First of all"
01:28:44;01:28:47;"I want to show solidarity with the Puthenators"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Agree to disagree"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"Let's agree to disagree"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"Puthenators"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"We heard this one last time, too"
01:28:52;01:29:03;"I think you like this song, Jake"
01:29:03;01:29:04;"Did I?"
01:29:05;01:29:13;"Is he a Canadian kid?"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"No, he's American"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"I know that dress is karma"
01:29:19;01:29:21;"Perfume regret"
01:29:21;01:29:25;"You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine"
01:29:25;01:29:29;"And now I'm all up on you"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"What you expect"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"But you're not coming home with me tonight"
01:29:34;01:29:37;"You just want attention"
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Oh, the bass"
01:29:38;01:29:39;"Oh, yeah"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"We like this song"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"You just hate the thought of me"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"With someone else"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"So R.H.T.F."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"You just want attention"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"I knew from the start"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"You're just making sure I'm right"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"You know who you are"
01:29:54;01:29:57;"Oh, you're running around, running around"
01:29:57;01:30:00;"Throwing that dirt all on my name"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"You're not gonna get it back"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"'Cause I'm pulling you up"
01:30:04;01:30:07;"You're never gonna get it back"
01:30:07;01:30:10;"'Cause you're never gonna get it back"
01:30:10;01:30:11;"'Cause you're already done"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"You already know that you are"

01:31:59;01:32:02;"'Cause you're already done"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"And they're playing arenas across the country, so..."
01:32:06;01:32:09;"They're probably selling 10,000 to 15,000 tickets"
01:32:09;01:32:12;"in most major markets, at least."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"And they might even be doing multiple nights, so..."
01:32:14;01:32:17;"And I'm just this 40-year-old jack-off"
01:32:17;01:32:20;"on this dumb show"

01:43:24;01:43:26;"One small theme I've noticed"
01:43:26;01:43:29;"'cause you forwarded me the emails."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"And I have noticed"
01:43:31;01:43:33;"we did get a lot of offers from people"
01:43:33;01:43:35;"to continue what we had"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"when Kenny called into the show a few episodes ago"
01:43:37;01:43:39;"to keep bringing more youth perspective."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"And specifically, we've had a lot of people saying"
01:43:41;01:43:44;"they could be One Direction solo correspondents for us."
01:43:44;01:43:45;"Right."
01:43:45;01:43:46;"Which is a good idea."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Maybe we get one of them to call in"
01:43:48;01:43:49;"and do a breakdown."
01:43:49;01:43:51;"I don't have any idea."
01:43:51;01:43:54;"I definitely have a better idea than you."
01:43:54;01:43:56;"But it's funny, as we do the top five"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"and I'm taking it in slowly,"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"it's pretty interesting listening to this back to back"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"'cause it's like Niall Horan,"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"I mean it's all branding."
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Forget about the music for a second."
01:44:04;01:44:05;"It's all branding."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"But Niall Horan is like,"
01:44:07;01:44:09;"he's like this studious, more intense dude."
01:44:09;01:44:11;"He's hanging out with grownups."
01:44:11;01:44:12;"Old men."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"Like Don Henley, he's studying them."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"He wants to build this."
01:44:16;01:44:19;"So his music is very,"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"has this attention to detail about making early 80s Don Henley."

01:45:03;01:45:05;"He got hung out."
01:45:05;01:45:07;"He looked like, stressed out."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"He yelled a little bit."
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Okay, I wouldn't say he was great, but yeah, he like--"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"He had some big moments."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"He did his job."

01:45:21;01:45:22;"Stressful."

01:46:10;01:46:11;"It's because then it's like--"
01:46:11;01:46:12;"So then I say goodbye to my friend,"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"and then next thing you know, I'm at the studio,"

01:46:15;01:46:17;"and there are just so many times during the day"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"I just kept wanting to talk about Dunkirk."
01:46:19;01:46:20;"That was kind of funny."
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:21;01:46:23;"It's just trying to put down some tasteful guitar riffs"

01:51:50;01:51:54;"I don't know if he actually said that, or if that's somebody from his church said that."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"Like, that's cool."
01:51:55;01:51:58;"I would just love to get some details about that,"

01:52:10;01:52:12;"I mean, that's a general platitude."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Well, right."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"But look, if somebody says they're exhausted--"
01:52:14;01:52:18;"They checked themselves into the hospital for exhaustion, you're like, ""What?"""
01:52:18;01:52:19;"Right, but I'm saying--"
01:52:19;01:52:23;"What about the dude working 80 hours a week at some crap job?"
01:52:23;01:52:24;"That's exhaustion too."
01:52:24;01:52:25;"Okay, okay."
01:52:25;01:52:28;"When I hear that, I'm just like, ""Something--I don't buy that."""
01:52:28;01:52:32;"I'm just saying that at least if somebody says exhaustion and you wonder if behind it"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"there's something more serious or there's more to the story,"
01:52:34;01:52:38;"at least you could be like--that's also their way of telling you it's private."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"Exactly."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"You know what I mean?"
01:52:40;01:52:42;"And it's kind of like--you should be like, ""Okay."""
01:52:42;01:52:45;"Maybe you're curious, but it's like, ""Okay, you're a human being."
01:52:45;01:52:47;"Your job is not saving lives."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"You don't have to go into it."""
01:52:49;01:52:52;"But the rededicating your life to Christ is interesting"
01:52:52;01:52:57;"because there's certainly an evangelical side to Christianity."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"Justin Bieber was raised as an evangelical Christian,"
01:52:59;01:53:03;"so it does kind of beg the question, like, what aspect of touring"
01:53:03;01:53:06;"affected your relationship to Christ?"
01:53:06;01:53:11;"Because literally there are people who go on tour to share the message of Christ"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"through the world, right?"
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Many people."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"So I don't know."
01:53:15;01:53:18;"Obviously, it's personal and it's private, but, you know,"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"always very interested on the relationship between religion and music."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"So I'm just curious."
01:53:22;01:53:26;"What if Bieber dropped a deeply Christian record?"
01:53:26;01:53:32;"Or, like, go on tour and do, like, a Kanye speech in the middle of the tour"
01:53:32;01:53:33;"except it's just, like, Christian stuff?"
01:53:33;01:53:36;"His management would have a heart attack."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"Eh, everybody knows that Justin is, like, of a Christian background."
01:53:40;01:53:43;"It's an interesting conundrum."
01:53:43;01:53:47;"What if he really went, like, deep, deep in and was just like,"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"""I don't care. I don't care about my career."
01:53:49;01:53:52;"I'm just, like, I got to, like, spread the good word to the people,"
01:53:52;01:53:55;"and I'm going to do, like, a 40-minute sermon mid-set""?"
01:53:55;01:53:56;"He'd be so into that."
01:53:56;01:53:58;"I mean, yeah, I would love it."
01:53:58;01:54:03;"I'm sure his management would just be like, ""Okay, let's explore that."""
01:54:03;01:54:06;"Be like, ""We liked it better when you were getting DUIs, Justin."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"See? Maybe Kanye was right."""
01:54:08;01:54:09;"I forget what he said."
01:54:09;01:54:14;"He said something about you can rap about anything except for Jesus."
01:54:14;01:54:16;"I don't know."
01:54:16;01:54:21;"That is, like, the most taboo territory for mainstream kind of pop."
01:54:21;01:54:24;"Obviously, like, the Christian music market's huge, but--"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"Yeah, it's different."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"There's a lot of artists who people know to be Christian,"
01:54:27;01:54:30;"but the music doesn't necessarily have a Christian message."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"Bieber and U2 should hook up."
01:54:33;01:54:38;"Well, also, apparently he got kind of a new church that he's a part of."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"I'm just genuinely curious."
01:54:39;01:54:42;"Maybe he will come out and share this information and be like,"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"""Okay, guys, I know that when I canceled the tour"
01:54:44;01:54:47;"and I gave a reason related to my religion,"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"some people got and some people didn't."""
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Well, yeah, let me explain."
01:54:51;01:54:54;"He feels like some of the material doesn't reflect his values."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"That's understandable."
01:54:55;01:55:01;"That's a classic musician perspective shift."
01:55:01;01:55:03;"People don't want to do secular music anymore."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"Cat Stevens."
01:55:05;01:55:06;"Yeah, Al Green."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"Right."
01:55:07;01:55:09;"Anyway, Justin, if you ever want to talk about it--"
01:55:09;01:55:10;"Call in."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"You know the number."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"You got my number."
01:55:13;01:55:17;"I don't think you have Ezra's, but you got mine."
01:55:17;01:55:22;"If it's cool, Jake can give your number to me."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Hey, Justin, Ezra here."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Jake, give me your contact."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"Ooh."
01:55:27;01:55:30;"Just a few questions about the tour cancellation."
01:55:30;01:55:33;"But it's also interesting because first he said that it was about exhaustion,"
01:55:33;01:55:36;"so there's a lot of people being like, ""Hey, exhaustion, whatever."""
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Yeah."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"And then the Christ thing is actually more interesting."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"It just raises a lot more theological questions and stuff."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"Anyway, that's our show."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Covered a lot of ground."
01:55:45;01:55:47;"This is a real epic one."
01:55:47;01:55:49;"Remember, Gerard was here before."
01:55:49;01:55:53;"And also I want to say rest in peace to Chester Bennington."
01:55:53;01:55:56;"Obviously very sad to hear that news."
01:55:56;01:55:59;"Best to all his fans, family, friends."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"I always really did--I don't know."
01:56:01;01:56:05;"When I saw that, I was like--I definitely felt a little messed up by that."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"I've never been a huge Linkin Park fan,"
01:56:08;01:56:11;"but there was something I always thought was cool about him."
01:56:11;01:56:12;"I don't know."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"He just always seemed like a real one."
01:56:13;01:56:16;"And to anybody else who's a Chester fan,"
01:56:16;01:56:20;"you should check out later today on Apple Music,"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"Corey from Slipknot on a series of bleeps"
01:56:22;01:56:26;"is doing a whole show dedicated to Chester and other musicians"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"who have struggled in similar ways."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"So you should check that out."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:56:32;01:56:38;"Thanks to everybody who called in--RJ, Steve, and Gerard--"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"for being here in person."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"Peace."
