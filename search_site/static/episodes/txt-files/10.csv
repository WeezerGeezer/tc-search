00:05;00:07;">> Time Crisis Episode 10."
00:07;00:10;"Wow, can't believe we're here."
00:10;00:13;"Today marks the triumphant return of Jake Longstreth,"
00:13;00:15;"who's been gone for two weeks in China,"
00:15;00:17;"and a new guest on the show,"
00:17;00:19;"writer and comedian Joe Mandi."
00:19;00:23;"I'm going to try to patch things up with Seinfeld 2000,"
00:23;00:27;"but more than anything, I'll be playing great, beautiful music."
00:27;00:32;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:35;"Beast One."
05:55;05:59;"That was Grimes with Flesh Without Blood from her new album Art Angels."
05:59;06:01;"Very hot album, just released."
06:01;06:04;"I'm your host, Ezra Koenig, and I'm joined in the studio by Jake Longstreth."
06:04;06:05;"What's up, Jake?"
06:05;06:06;"Hey, man."
06:06;06:07;"And Joe Mandi, first time on the show."
06:07;06:08;"Yeah, what up?"
06:08;06:09;"What's up, Joe? Who are you, man?"
06:09;06:16;"I'm a writer and comedian, and Wikipedia says ""internet personality,"" which I'm not happy about."
06:16;06:17;"You're a triple threat."
06:17;06:20;"I guess, although the last threat's not much of a threat."
06:20;06:24;"So what kind of writing do you do, like nonfiction, poetry?"
06:24;06:25;"Mostly poetry."
06:25;06:26;"Oh, nice."
06:26;06:29;"But also television writing, sitcoms."
06:29;06:32;"So you wrote on Parks and Rec. I just watched all of Parks and Rec."
06:32;06:33;"The whole thing?"
06:33;06:34;"Yeah."
06:34;06:35;"Wow, that's tight."
06:35;06:37;"I guess over the past, like, four months, but--"
06:37;06:38;"Yeah."
06:38;06:40;"I finished it three days ago."
06:40;06:41;"Well, thank you."
06:41;06:42;"Beautiful program."
06:42;06:43;"Thank you."
06:43;06:44;"Okay."
06:44;06:45;"I jumped the gun a little bit."
06:45;06:46;"It was presumptuous."
06:46;06:47;"I feel like it was crap."
06:47;06:48;"Wonderful program."
06:48;06:51;"And then also, you were just writing on another hit show."
06:51;06:53;"Master of None."
06:53;06:55;"Which is the Aziz Ansari program."
06:55;06:56;"Yes."
06:56;06:57;"Yeah."
06:57;07:00;"This is the best-reviewed program, I think, since Cheers."
07:00;07:01;"Pretty much, yeah."
07:01;07:06;"It's Cheers #1, then Master of None, and then Grace Under Fire."
07:06;07:07;"You guys are killing it."
07:07;07:08;"Yeah."
07:08;07:10;"Jake, so you've been in China for two weeks."
07:10;07:11;"Yeah."
07:11;07:12;"We missed you."
07:12;07:13;"I missed you."
07:13;07:14;"What's going on in China, man?"
07:14;07:15;"What were you doing there?"
07:15;07:19;"I was over in Beijing for an art exhibit that I had paintings in."
07:19;07:20;"Mm-hmm."
07:20;07:24;"And some young art collectors started a museum there,"
07:24;07:29;"and they put together a big show--a big international show of different painters"
07:29;07:34;"from Europe, the States, Philippines, South America, China."
07:34;07:35;"It was very global."
07:35;07:36;"Yeah."
07:36;07:38;"So I was there, and it was great."
07:38;07:40;"What kind of art is hot in China right now?"
07:40;07:42;"I don't--I mean, all kinds."
07:42;07:44;"So you held it down for America?"
07:44;07:45;"Yeah."
07:45;07:47;"It was like maybe three or four Americans."
07:47;07:48;"Uh-huh."
07:48;07:51;"And then I went out to the Great Wall, which was amazing."
07:51;07:53;"The Great Wall of China."
07:53;07:54;"Oh, right."
07:54;07:55;"You're looking at me blankly."
07:55;07:56;"I've heard about it."
07:56;07:57;"You've got to specify."
07:57;07:58;"There's a lot of walls."
07:58;07:59;"Great Wall."
07:59;08:00;"Yeah."
08:00;08:01;"Which is incredible."
08:01;08:02;"Yeah."
08:02;08:04;"What do you do when you go to the Great Wall of China?"
08:04;08:06;"Because it's very long."
08:06;08:07;"You can't walk it."
08:07;08:08;"You can walk part of it."
08:08;08:09;"Walk part of it."
08:09;08:12;"No, I mean, it spans--I was reading about it in Wikipedia when I was there."
08:12;08:16;"There's something like 3,000 miles worth of wall."
08:16;08:17;"No, no, I'm sorry."
08:17;08:19;"It spans 3,000 miles."
08:19;08:21;"But it's actually--because there's switchbacks and stuff,"
08:21;08:23;"it's actually 5,000 miles of wall."
08:23;08:29;"And it was built over 1,000 years to keep the nomadic hordes of people"
08:29;08:33;"from Mongolia who came down to try to take over China again and again."
08:33;08:34;"And eventually did."
08:34;08:38;"So is it like the Brooklyn Bridge where there are people selling soda and stuff?"
08:38;08:39;"Yeah."
08:39;08:40;"Beer, soda, Snickers."
08:40;08:42;"I actually had a beer and a Snickers."
08:42;08:44;"And actually at one point, just one quick story,"
08:44;08:47;"I was in one of those guard posts, and there was a bulletin board"
08:47;08:52;"where you could kind of sign your name, like, ""Timmy plus Jesse, 2009."""
08:52;08:53;"Right."
08:53;08:56;"Someone had written in huge block letters, ""Trump, 2016,"""
08:56;08:59;"which totally threw me for a loop because I was like,"
08:59;09:02;"""Did this person--was this like a sarcastic commentary on Trump"
09:02;09:05;"who is a huge supporter of walls?"""
09:05;09:09;"And then the wall between America and Mexico obviously being like a futile endeavor,"
09:09;09:12;"and the wall between Mongolia and China was obviously--or not."
09:12;09:16;"Or was it just like a straight-up Trump supporter who just failed to see the irony?"
09:16;09:17;"Right."
09:17;09:19;"Or was it a joke from like 10 years ago?"
09:19;09:22;"Like imagine the notion, the thought of him being the president."
09:22;09:23;"Right."
09:23;09:25;"If you're the person who wrote ""Trump, 2016"" on the gray wall of China,"
09:25;09:28;"we'd love to hear from you."
09:28;09:29;"I bet they were being funny."
09:29;09:30;"Oh, who knows?"
09:30;09:31;"You don't know, man."
09:31;09:34;"That's just me in my little downtown New York liberal bubble."
09:34;09:37;"This is the first show for you in November."
09:37;09:39;"You missed our first November show."
09:39;09:41;"We've been trying to keep it a little bit eerie."
09:41;09:42;"I don't know about today."
09:42;09:44;"Today we're going to go all over the place, but I really f---ed up,"
09:44;09:48;"and I didn't play this song last time because this is the ultimate November song."
09:48;09:49;"You know what I'm talking about?"
09:49;09:50;"Wyclef Jean?"
09:50;09:51;"""Rain""?"
09:51;09:52;"Yeah."
09:52;09:53;"November ""Rain."""
09:53;09:54;"Oh, man, there's two November songs."
09:54;09:55;"We'll play both of them."
09:55;09:57;"But yeah, November ""Rain,"" ""Guns N' Roses,"""
09:57;09:59;"and obviously you also made the classic album ""Chinese Democracy,"""
09:59;10:02;"so there's a lot of connections here."
10:02;10:05;"But here's Axl on the boys with ""November Rain."""
10:05;10:08;"It's a long one, but stick around."

18:42;18:45;"- That was Guns N' Roses with November Rain."
18:45;18:47;"Weird song."
18:47;18:48;"- Yeah."
18:48;18:50;"You know that was written in '85?"
18:50;18:51;"- I can feel it."
18:51;18:54;"- There's, 'cause that's off the 1991 album,"
18:54;18:54;"Use Your Illusion."
18:54;18:55;"- Right."
18:55;18:56;"- I forget, one or two, but--"
18:56;18:57;"- One."
18:57;18:59;"- On YouTube, there's demos of Axl"
18:59;19:02;"on like a four track recording in '85,"
19:02;19:04;"laying down that song."
19:04;19:05;"And then, oh, also Don't Cry,"
19:05;19:07;"which was the other big ballad off that record."
19:07;19:08;"- Yeah."
19:08;19:08;"- Also from that same period."
19:08;19:09;"Which makes you think that like all,"
19:09;19:13;"like the entire Gene R. Cannon was written"
19:13;19:16;"within like a 12 month period in '85 and '86."
19:16;19:17;"'Cause--"
19:17;19:18;"- It's very possible."
19:18;19:18;"- Yeah, yeah."
19:18;19:19;"I thought that was interesting though,"
19:19;19:21;"that they like sat on it for six years."
19:21;19:22;"- Well, he wanted to get it perfect."
19:22;19:23;"- Right."
19:23;19:24;"- But it's also songs like that make you,"
19:24;19:26;"you know that song, I think came out"
19:26;19:28;"like a month before Nevermind."
19:28;19:29;"- That's crazy."
19:29;19:30;"- 'Cause it reminds you, like that song"
19:30;19:31;"is still like so '80s."
19:31;19:32;"- Oh yeah."
19:32;19:34;"- But Guns N' Roses, they knew how to toe that line"
19:34;19:35;"between '80s and '90s."
19:35;19:36;"They stuck around for a minute."
19:36;19:37;"So Joe, you pointed out before"
19:37;19:39;"that the other great November song"
19:39;19:40;"is Wyclef."
19:40;19:41;"- Wyclef."
19:41;19:41;"- Are you a Wyclef fan?"
19:41;19:43;"- No, I just came to mind though."
19:43;19:44;"- You're not a Wyclef fan?"
19:44;19:45;"- I wouldn't say I'm a--"
19:45;19:46;"- But I thought you loved hip hop."
19:46;19:47;"- I do, but yeah."
19:47;19:49;"- You don't like the Fugees?"
19:49;19:50;"- Love the Fugees."
19:50;19:53;"The individual endeavors, I wasn't,"
19:53;19:55;"other than Lauryn Hill's album, I wasn't,"
19:55;19:58;"I couldn't get behind Carnival or whatever."
19:58;19:59;"Proz did."
19:59;20:00;"- Okay."
20:00;20:04;"- Well, is he an investor in beats?"
20:04;20:07;"- He's, he and I have personal business ventures together."
20:07;20:07;"- Okay."
20:07;20:10;"- We're from very near each other in New Jersey."
20:10;20:12;"Well, let's see if this changes your mind a little bit"
20:12;20:13;"when you listen to it again."

26:53;26:56;"I wanted to play that song because I've always loved it."
26:56;26:57;"And now it's coming to prominence again"
26:57;26:59;"because it's used in ""Master of None."""
26:59;27:00;"- Correct, yeah."
27:00;27:03;"- The Aziz program that Joe Mandi wrote on."
27:03;27:03;"- Yeah."
27:03;27:05;"- It's such a weird, vibey song."
27:05;27:06;"I love '60s French music."
27:06;27:08;"- The music's great on the show."
27:08;27:09;"I had no part in it."
27:09;27:10;"- Yeah, can we talk about that for a second?"
27:10;27:12;"'Cause I'm a music industry professional."
27:12;27:13;"- Sure."
27:13;27:16;"- I would guess that based on some of the sync,"
27:16;27:17;"we call these syncs in the business."
27:17;27:18;"- Sure."
27:18;27:19;"- 'Cause I've been on both sides of it."
27:19;27:22;"Sometimes I'm trying to get a sync for something,"
27:22;27:24;"and sometimes people ask me for a ""Vampire Weekend"" song"
27:24;27:26;"to use in a film or a program."
27:26;27:28;"You know, sometimes you can get stuff for cheap,"
27:28;27:30;"but the hard thing to get for cheap"
27:30;27:32;"are like these older songs."
27:32;27:34;"Because for instance, ""Walk on the Wild Side"" by Lou Reed."
27:34;27:36;"Lou Reed is dead, rest in peace."
27:36;27:38;"Whoever's controlling that estate"
27:38;27:39;"would probably not have any reason"
27:39;27:41;"to give it to Aziz's show for cheap."
27:41;27:43;"So there's that song,"
27:43;27:47;"there's some like really classic hip hop."
27:47;27:50;"I would guess that the music budget for that show,"
27:50;27:51;"$20 million."
27:51;27:54;"- I can't answer that,"
27:54;27:56;"'cause I don't know, I had nothing to do with it."
27:56;27:59;"But I can text Aziz and ask how much the music budget was."
27:59;28:01;"- Please text Aziz, hopefully he'll write back later"
28:01;28:02;"and we'll find out."
28:02;28:03;"Was it 20 million?"
28:03;28:05;"Was it more, was it 30 million?"
28:05;28:10;"- He just wrote back in infinity symbol."
28:10;28:10;"- Oh boy."
28:10;28:13;"That's the power he's,"
28:13;28:15;"that's how much power he has at Netflix."
28:15;28:18;"- There's literally just money still rolling out from that."
28:18;28:19;"Let's listen to some more music,"
28:19;28:22;"more French music from the '60s."
28:22;28:23;"- Montana, no, okay."
28:23;28:25;"- We'll listen to some French Montana later."
28:25;28:26;"- Cool, I would appreciate that."
28:26;28:28;"- This is some classic French '60s."
28:28;28:29;"This is something everybody likes to listen to."
28:29;28:31;"This is Francoise Hardy."
28:31;28:32;"I think that's how the French people say it,"

35:15;35:17;"- This is New York News."
35:17;35:21;"- What's going on in the Big Apple?"
35:21;35:23;"You guys ready to find out?"
35:23;35:26;"Have you heard about this Shia LaBeouf screening?"
35:26;35:29;"Shia LaBeouf is screening all of his films"
35:29;35:31;"at the Angelica Film Center,"
35:31;35:34;"a wonderful theater in downtown Manhattan."
35:34;35:36;"He's watching them chronologically,"
35:36;35:38;"and the public is invited to join him,"
35:38;35:41;"although we have an article here that says"
35:41;35:44;"there were only four people waiting to go in"
35:44;35:45;"and watch with him."
35:45;35:46;"- That's crazy."
35:46;35:47;"- That doesn't make any sense to me."
35:47;35:48;"- No."
35:48;35:49;"- That sounds like a lie."
35:49;35:51;"- If I had known earlier, I would have flown out for this."
35:51;35:53;"- I mean, he's been in many great films."
35:53;35:55;"What are you guys' favorite Shia films?"
35:55;35:57;"- Holes, number one with a bullet, Holes."
35:57;35:58;"- Holes? What's that?"
35:58;35:59;"- Holes?"
35:59;36:01;"- Holes, it was, he was still a child."
36:01;36:03;"It was a movie about he and a bunch of kids"
36:03;36:05;"digging holes in the ground."
36:05;36:06;"- Oh, I like it."
36:06;36:09;"- 'Cause that's where he was great, that era."
36:09;36:11;"- Yeah, a lot of people forget that he was a child actor."
36:11;36:13;"- I watched Even Stevens on the reg when I was in college."
36:13;36:14;"I loved that show."
36:14;36:15;"- That was a child's program."
36:15;36:17;"- Weird to admit that I would get stoned"
36:17;36:19;"and watch a Disney channel,"
36:19;36:22;"but I would be like, this kid has perfect comedic timing."
36:22;36:23;"He's a great actor."
36:23;36:25;"- You should have started managing him."
36:25;36:26;"- I really should have."
36:26;36:27;"- You're too stoned."
36:27;36:29;"- Yeah, I know, and I was 19."
36:29;36:31;"- Jake, what's your favorite Shia film?"
36:31;36:32;"- I'm struggling to think of one."
36:32;36:33;"- Oh, come on."
36:33;36:34;"- Disturbia?"
36:34;36:35;"- Yeah."
36:36;36:37;"- Anyone, anyone?"
36:37;36:38;"- That's right."
36:38;36:39;"- And then there's the one--"
36:39;36:40;"- Also Rihanna's song."
36:40;36:42;"- That came out a few years ago, kind of came and went."
36:42;36:44;"It's like a journalist film with Robert Redford."
36:44;36:46;"- Oh, I vaguely remember that."
36:46;36:47;"- It's a really generic title"
36:47;36:48;"that you would forget immediately."
36:48;36:49;"That's why I'm not remembering,"
36:49;36:51;"but it's like a straightforward,"
36:51;36:53;"sort of like journalistic thriller."
36:53;36:54;"- That's tight."
36:54;36:55;"He's a great actor."
36:55;36:56;"- No, I think he's talented."
36:56;36:57;"- And a great freestyle rapper."
36:57;36:58;"I don't know if you've seen that."
36:58;36:59;"- Yeah, I saw the video."
36:59;37:00;"He's a good dude."
37:00;37:01;"I've met him a couple times."
37:01;37:04;"One time was Vampire Weekend was on tour."
37:04;37:06;"We played a show in Amsterdam,"
37:06;37:08;"and Kid Cudi came to the show,"
37:08;37:09;"and he had a bunch of people with him,"
37:09;37:10;"one of whom was Shia,"
37:10;37:12;"who at the time was like making a video or--"
37:12;37:13;"- Okay."
37:13;37:14;"- I don't know."
37:14;37:16;"- But he was a part of Cudi's crew?"
37:16;37:18;"- Yes, actors and rappers love to hang out."
37:18;37:19;"Everybody knows this."
37:19;37:20;"- Yeah."
37:20;37:21;"- So they were there in Amsterdam together,"
37:21;37:22;"and they came backstage,"
37:22;37:24;"and everybody knows that a Vampire Weekend backstage"
37:24;37:26;"scenario is very boring."
37:26;37:27;"So they came, we chatted a little bit,"
37:27;37:29;"and then they left very quickly."
37:29;37:31;"But, you know, Shia seemed like a nice guy."
37:31;37:32;"Kid Cudi seemed like a nice guy."
37:32;37:34;"And then the next morning,"
37:34;37:36;"I was catching a very early flight by myself"
37:36;37:38;"'cause I needed a break,"
37:38;37:42;"and I went down to the hotel breakfast buffet."
37:42;37:43;"Around 6 a.m. it was very dark,"
37:43;37:44;"and it was fully empty."
37:44;37:47;"And then a figure emerged and came in,"
37:47;37:49;"and it was Shia, and it was just the two of us"
37:49;37:53;"in this, like, super awkward Dutch breakfast buffet."
37:53;37:56;"- And I'm guessing he had been out all night."
37:56;37:57;"- Unclear."
37:57;37:58;"- Unclear, okay."
37:58;37:59;"- Unclear."
37:59;38:00;"I had definitely just woken up."
38:00;38:01;"It was, like, still dark outside."
38:01;38:02;"- Right."
38:02;38:03;"- So then at 6 a.m. we just, like, sat,"
38:03;38:05;"and I was kind of like, ""Oh, should we--"
38:05;38:06;"""Can I join you?"""
38:06;38:07;"Would have seemed weird for us"
38:07;38:08;"to just, like, not sit together,"
38:08;38:09;"we were the only people there."
38:09;38:10;"And then we sat and chatted,"
38:10;38:12;"and I remember he was wrapping up ""Transformers,"""
38:12;38:13;"had a lot of questions about that."
38:13;38:16;"- So that was right after it came out, or before?"
38:16;38:18;"- It must have been, like, around the time"
38:18;38:19;"of the last movie or something."
38:19;38:20;"- Mm-hmm."
38:20;38:21;"- And he seemed like a very interesting guy,"
38:21;38:23;"and then I ran into him at a coffee bean"
38:23;38:25;"not too long ago, and I said, ""What's up?"""
38:25;38:27;"And he remembered me, and he was very polite,"
38:27;38:28;"and you know what?"
38:28;38:29;"I'll always root for Shia."
38:29;38:30;"- Me too."
38:30;38:31;"I'm a huge fan."
38:31;38:35;"- And I don't like people trying to question his motives."
38:35;38:36;"- No."
38:36;38:37;"I mean, I'd be ha--"
38:37;38:39;"I want to write the ""Evan Stevens"" movie."
38:39;38:40;"- Oh, that's a good idea."
38:40;38:41;"- Bring him back."
38:41;38:43;"- Maybe there should be, like,"
38:43;38:45;"Netflix will reboot ""Evan Stevens."""
38:45;38:46;"- Ugh, I would die."
38:46;38:47;"- Maybe a little bit darker."
38:47;38:48;"- Definitely darker."
38:48;38:49;"- Throw in some Lou Reed songs."
38:49;38:50;"- Right."
38:50;38:51;"- We love you, Shia."

40:28;40:31;"when Christmas comes around, you got all these other people"

40:32;40:35;"I remember when I was a kid, when I was like 7, 8,"

40:42;40:44;"you have people attacking it."
40:44;40:47;"First of all, no one ever attacks it."
40:47;40:52;"It's pure insecurity on the side of Christmas people."
40:52;40:53;"What do you mean by Christmas people?"
40:53;40:56;"I mean Christians, insecure Christians who say,"
40:56;40:59;"""My coffee cup doesn't say Christmas anymore."
40:59;41:01;"This is horrible."""
41:01;41:02;"Happy holidays."
41:02;41:04;"Happy holidays, that's a crime."
41:04;41:08;"And if I sound bitter, it's because as a young Jewish boy,"
41:08;41:11;"the day after Halloween, there'd be Christmas music,"
41:11;41:13;"and I'd be like, ""This is crazy."""
41:13;41:15;"You can't have two months of Christmas."
41:15;41:17;"I know how you feel, Joe."
41:17;41:19;"I almost called you Jew."
41:19;41:20;"That works too."
41:20;41:22;"I know how you feel, Jew Mandy."
41:22;41:25;"I was also raised as a young Jewish boy,"
41:25;41:27;"and I remember apparently when I was a kid,"
41:27;41:29;"my mom has a story she always tells"
41:29;41:32;"that because we had to celebrate Hanukkah, not Christmas,"
41:32;41:35;"that once she was pushing me in the shopping cart"
41:35;41:38;"at the supermarket, and there was all the dope Christmas candy,"
41:38;41:41;"all the beautiful candy canes and special M&Ms,"
41:41;41:43;"and that apparently I said to my mom,"
41:43;41:45;"""Mom, can I get some of this Christmas candy?"""
41:45;41:47;"Because I was a kid, kids love candy."
41:47;41:48;"And she said, ""Boys, we're Jewish,"
41:48;41:50;"so I'm not going to buy you Christmas candy."""

42:03;42:04;"who wages a war on Christmas."
42:04;42:06;"So Christians invite me into their home,"
42:06;42:08;"and I'm very polite, and I celebrate Christmas with them,"
42:08;42:10;"and I don't make them feel uncomfortable."
42:10;42:11;"I'll celebrate Christmas."
42:11;42:15;"I love Christmas, but if a war actually materialized,"
42:15;42:16;"I'm on the other side."
42:16;42:17;"Really?"
42:17;42:19;"Yeah. I think I have to be."
42:19;42:21;"I would defend Christmas if I could."
42:21;42:23;"So Jake, you grew up celebrating Christmas."

42:27;42:29;"It was the best holiday growing up."
42:29;42:30;"Still is, I imagine."
42:30;42:31;"Yeah, no, it's, you know--"
42:31;42:34;"It's a birthday party for Jesus. That's great."
42:34;42:36;"I mean, you hang out with your family."
42:36;42:38;"You have a long time off from school,"
42:38;42:40;"and you get gifts."
42:40;42:41;"It was the best."
42:41;42:42;"And candy."
42:42;42:44;"Looked forward to--I remember being young,"
42:44;42:47;"and it'd be exactly like October,"
42:47;42:50;"and I'd be like, ""Oh, Christmas is only two months away."""
42:50;42:52;"And that seemed--two months when you're nine"
42:52;42:54;"seems like an eternity."
42:54;42:57;"I remember counting down."
42:57;42:58;"I was so into it."
42:58;43:00;"It's a beautiful holiday. I like everything about it."
43:00;43:03;"But so how do you feel as somebody who's actually raised"
43:03;43:05;"at least some type of Christian household"
43:05;43:06;"with what's going on now?"
43:06;43:08;"Because this is what's in the news,"
43:08;43:11;"is that Starbucks made these disgusting red cups."
43:11;43:14;"They used to have more, like, Christmassy stuff,"
43:14;43:17;"and then I don't know how they even picked the color red."
43:17;43:19;"It has nothing to do with Christmas. It's horrible."
43:19;43:20;"So then they do these weird--"
43:20;43:21;"It's one of the three."
43:21;43:22;"One of the three what?"
43:22;43:23;"Colors of Christmas."
43:23;43:26;"I don't know. It's a communist color."
43:26;43:28;"So Starbucks, for some insane reason,"
43:28;43:31;"chooses to make these red cups instead of, like, you know,"
43:31;43:33;"something that actually represents Christmas."
43:33;43:35;"What do they say on there? Anything? Just red?"
43:35;43:36;"No, it's just red."
43:36;43:38;"Oh, no, it says, ""Happy holidays in place of Merry Christmas."""
43:38;43:39;"This is pure propaganda."
43:39;43:41;"No, no, no, it's just red."
43:41;43:42;"This is pure propaganda."
43:42;43:44;"They never said Merry Christmas."
43:44;43:45;"This cup's never said Merry Christmas?"
43:45;43:47;"Starbucks released a statement, never said it."
43:47;43:49;"Well, one thing that I found interesting"
43:49;43:52;"is that one of the guys who kind of started the boycott--"
43:52;43:53;"or not the boycott Starbucks."
43:53;43:57;"His whole idea was instead of boycotting Starbucks,"
43:57;44:00;"you should go in there and tell them that your name is Merry Christmas."
44:00;44:02;"Let's listen to a clip of this guy,"
44:02;44:05;"because he made a video on Facebook that kind of kicked it all off."
44:05;44:06;"Hey, guys, what's up? Josh Bernstein here."
44:06;44:08;"You know, I think in the age of political correctness,"
44:08;44:09;"we become so open-minded,"
44:09;44:11;"our brains have literally fallen out of our head."
44:11;44:15;"Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas"
44:15;44:17;"off of their brand-new cups?"
44:17;44:19;"That's why they're just plain red."
44:19;44:21;"In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn't allowed to say"
44:21;44:22;"Merry Christmas to customers?"
44:22;44:25;"Well, I decided instead of simply boycotting,"
44:25;44:27;"well, why don't we just start a movement?"
44:27;44:29;"So when I went in and I asked for my coffee,"
44:29;44:31;"they asked for my name, and I told them,"
44:31;44:33;"""My name is Merry Christmas."""
44:33;44:34;"So guess what?"
44:34;44:39;"Starbucks, I tricked you into putting Merry Christmas on your cup."
44:39;44:43;"So this guy, he's saying that you should go into Starbucks"
44:43;44:45;"and order your coffee and say your name is Merry Christmas,"
44:45;44:49;"forcing the anti-Christian maniacs to write Merry Christmas on the cup."
44:49;44:52;"I feel bad that this evangelical Christian man"
44:52;44:55;"who's fighting back in the war on Christmas"
44:55;44:58;"had the misfortune to be named Joshua Feuerstein"
44:58;45:02;"because, look, these are just German names, I guess, Feuerstein,"
45:02;45:04;"but that sounds mad Jewish."
45:04;45:06;"Crazy. Joshua. Joshua. Feuerstein."
45:06;45:07;"Feuerstein."
45:07;45:08;"Or For-steen."
45:08;45:11;"I bet Starbucks thought they were just doing something kind of cool and minimalist."
45:11;45:14;"Like, this year, instead of a picture of a polar bear licking a candy cane,"
45:14;45:16;"we're going to make a red cup."
45:16;45:19;"Also, they still make Christmas blend coffee."
45:19;45:22;"You order Christmas blend coffee for a full month."
45:22;45:24;"I didn't know that."
45:24;45:27;"You're honestly making me stop and question this war on Christmas thing."
45:27;45:28;"And you can still go in there."
45:28;45:31;"They have holiday-themed cookies and stuff."
45:31;45:33;"You can find Christmas in Starbucks."
45:33;45:34;"They're very pro-Christmas in Starbucks."
45:34;45:36;"This is a very weird boycott."
45:36;45:37;"You know what bothers me?"
45:37;45:39;"I love, even though I'm not a Christian,"
45:39;45:42;"Christianity is one of my top three favorite religions."
45:42;45:44;"I'm not going to say the other two because I don't want to get competitive,"
45:44;45:46;"but Christianity is always one of my favorite religions."
45:46;45:49;"I love the New Testament and the Bible."
45:49;45:50;"I love Christianity."
45:50;45:53;"I love Christian liturgical music."
45:53;45:54;"It's one of my favorite religions."
45:54;45:55;"Gospel music."
45:56;45:59;"I'm very lucky that I was raised in a primarily Christian country because I love it."
45:59;46:03;"But I don't like this because this is like this weird battle to fight,"
46:03;46:06;"whereas I always loved to put the Christ back in Christmas."
46:06;46:07;"Because I do."
46:07;46:09;"I do really admire Jesus,"
46:09;46:13;"and I love the idea that people would turn it into an anti-materialism thing."
46:13;46:14;"So I love--"
46:14;46:16;"Yeah, that's the real irony."
46:16;46:21;"I love when I see real Christian people who are protesting like big box stores,"
46:21;46:22;"and they're like, ""You know what?"
46:22;46:24;"We're getting a little bit materialistic."""
46:24;46:25;"Jesus would hate Christmas."
46:25;46:27;"He would hate Black Friday."
46:27;46:30;"He would hate Walmart being open on Thanksgiving."
46:30;46:31;"Yeah, so I love that."
46:31;46:33;"I think there is a Christmas war to fight."
46:33;46:34;"That's what I'm saying, dude."
46:34;46:35;"That's the war."
46:35;46:36;"All right, I got my eye on you, Joe."
46:36;46:37;"I don't know."
46:37;46:39;"I guess we should probably listen to some Christmas music now."
46:39;46:41;"Oh, God, really?"
46:41;46:43;"Well, it's after Halloween."
46:43;46:45;"I mean, I made it to deep November without playing any--"
46:45;46:46;"Can I request a song?"
46:46;46:47;"Yeah, what's your favorite Christmas song?"
46:47;46:49;"""Dipset Christmas"" with Jim Jones."
46:49;46:50;"Okay."
46:50;46:52;"""Dipset Christmas"" by Jim Jones."
46:52;46:53;"This song rules."
46:53;46:55;"It's gonna be a good Christmas this year."
46:55;46:57;"Santa know when you good or bad."
46:57;46:58;"And we ballin'."
46:58;47:00;"Music's tight."
47:00;47:03;"My pocket's stuffed."
47:03;47:05;"We're here tonight."
47:05;47:07;"The night's a song."
47:07;47:12;"Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time."
47:12;47:14;"Livin' fast."
47:14;47:17;"Dipset Christmas time."
47:17;47:20;"Look, I'm tryin' to live every day like it's Christmas."
47:20;47:22;"I Chevrolet so every day in the wrist is."
47:22;47:24;"Load from the cop eyes, feelin' like Popeye's."
47:24;47:27;"'Cause I'm in the coupe with a chicken and a biscuit."
47:27;47:29;"My *** get the same thing every year."
47:29;47:32;"Different mu-mu pair match the colors with their hair."
47:32;47:35;"And no, it cost kitty if I wear red monkey on my ***."
47:35;47:37;"1,100 for the pair."
47:37;47:39;"Might show 'em how to ball this year."
47:39;47:41;"Yeah, the dogs are fresh, London fog this year."
47:41;47:44;"Put the box up, pull out the fox long hair."
47:44;47:47;"Christ the deaf might open a mall this year."
47:47;47:49;"That's how I'm feelin' holiday season."
47:49;47:51;"That's the holiday greetings."
47:51;47:53;"Bought ranches for the holiday heathens."
47:53;47:56;"They might be doin' holiday squeezin', ***."
47:56;47:58;"Music's tight."
47:58;48:01;"My *** is stuck."
48:01;48:03;"We're here tonight."
48:03;48:06;"And that's a song."
48:06;48:10;"Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time."
48:10;48:12;"Livin' fast."
48:12;48:15;"Dipset Christmas time."
48:15;48:18;"I wanted all the racetracks to the ball games."
48:18;48:20;"Now we race fast in the Porsche thing."
48:20;48:23;"I got a ball gettin' cash off the raw king."
48:23;48:25;"And wifey wants a supercharged range."
48:25;48:27;"I'm thinkin' coupe might do the hard thing."
48:27;48:30;"Gotta do 70 and I'll pops the wing."
48:30;48:31;"A little car trivia."
48:31;48:33;"Every car giddy up like a Clydesdale."
48:33;48:35;"The mood is right and I'm high as hell."
48:35;48:38;"Big trucks through the snow like a one-horse sleigh."
48:38;48:40;"The V12 comin' 500 horseys."
48:40;48:43;"And my whole team ballin' and we all flossy."
48:43;48:45;"Now I'm hittin' piff while I'm sippin' eggnog."
48:45;48:48;"Poppin' my *** and I'm whippin' the best cars."
48:48;48:50;"That's 'cause we get dough."
48:50;48:52;"So this year, mommy bears with the red bow."
48:52;48:54;"You know we gettin' dollars like Craft Flo."
48:54;48:57;"Holiday season so we sippin' on the XO."
48:57;48:59;"My pocket's stuffed."
48:59;49:01;"We're here tonight."
49:01;49:04;"And that's what's up."
49:04;49:09;"Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time."
49:14;49:16;"Livin' fast."
49:16;49:19;"And we gettin' stips at Christmas time."
49:19;49:20;"It's Christmas time."
49:20;49:21;"Everybody jolly."
49:21;49:22;"Where the bottles at?"
49:22;49:23;"Feelin' good."
49:23;49:24;"Everybody want Polly."
49:24;49:25;"What's good, homie?"
49:25;49:26;"Get your flag on."
49:26;49:27;"Red rags out."
49:27;49:28;"Feeling good."
49:28;49:29;"Pull the red jacks out."
49:29;49:30;"Gettin' money."
49:30;49:31;"We gon' ball at the red lights."
49:31;49:33;"See a pretty *** line up with the headlights."
49:33;49:34;"What up?"
49:34;49:36;"Uh, I heard a load is poppin'."
49:36;49:38;"A lot of pretty *** with the fishnet stockin'."
49:38;49:39;"Tryin' slide, son."
49:39;49:40;"Hit the club."
49:40;49:41;"Buy the bar out."
49:41;49:42;"Where the dutchies at?"
49:42;49:43;"Get the jars out."
49:43;49:44;"Let's get high, bluh."
49:44;49:45;"And put the biffy in the air."
49:45;49:46;"I ain't that fit."
49:46;49:47;"Don't skit."
49:47;49:48;"We give it here."
49:48;49:49;"What's good, man?"
49:49;49:50;"And we can one, two step."
49:50;49:51;"Throw your gang up."
49:51;49:52;"What hood you rep?"
49:52;49:53;"Nine Trades."
49:53;49:54;"And everybody spaz out."
49:54;49:57;"Get glow, homie, 'til you *** pass out."
49:57;49:58;"It's Christmas."
49:58;50:00;"Music's tight."
50:00;50:02;"But I get stuck."
50:02;50:05;"We here tonight."
50:05;50:07;"And that's what's up."
50:07;50:12;"Livin' fast and ballin' at Christmas time."
50:17;50:19;"Livin' fast."
50:19;50:22;"It's Dipset Christmas time."
50:22;50:24;"Hey, hey."
50:24;50:27;"Oh, oh, oh."
50:27;50:32;"Have a fair old merry Christmas."
50:32;50:38;"Have a Dipset Christmas."
50:38;50:42;"That was Jim Jones with Dipset Xmas Time from his album Dipset Christmas."
50:42;50:44;"That was Joe Mandy's pick for a Christmas song."
50:44;50:45;"Yeah."
50:45;50:46;"That was a great song, man."
50:46;50:47;"Thank you."
50:47;50:48;"You're welcome."
50:48;50:49;"So you got a little Christmas love in you after all."
50:49;50:50;"You know, yeah, yeah."
50:50;50:51;"You're right."
50:51;50:52;"I felt kind of heated before, but that's all I needed."
50:52;50:53;"I don't mean it."
50:53;50:54;"I'm not gonna fight."
50:54;50:56;"See, everybody, we Jews love Christmas."
50:56;51:00;"Now, Jake, as a real Christian man in the building, no disrespect to you, Joe."
51:00;51:01;"No, I can't be."
51:01;51:07;"But Jake, as a real Christian man, do you have any Christmas rap songs that you love?"
51:07;51:11;"Yeah, Run DMC, Christmas in Hollis, featured at the beginning of Die Hard."
51:11;51:12;"Oh, right."
51:12;51:13;"That's right, yeah."
51:13;51:14;"Remember?"
51:14;51:15;"Great movie, great song."
51:15;51:16;"When John McClane's getting the limo ride from Argyle."
51:16;51:17;"All right."
51:17;51:18;"I love it."
51:18;51:22;"Very soon, we're gonna hear from Seinfeld 2000, who I patched things up with and is"
51:22;51:23;"gonna be back on there."
51:23;51:28;"But first, here's Jake's Christmas rap pick from the Die Hard soundtrack, Run DMC,"
51:28;51:29;"Christmas in Hollis."
51:29;51:56;"It was December 24th when Hollis' avenue's dark."
51:56;51:59;"When I see the man chillin' with his dog in the park."
51:59;52:01;"I approach him very slowly with my heart full of fear."
52:01;52:04;"Look at his dog, oh my God, a ill reindeer."
52:04;52:06;"But then I was ill and called the man at a bend."
52:06;52:09;"Had a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock at night."
52:09;52:11;"So I turned my head a second and the man was gone."
52:11;52:14;"But he must have dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn."
52:14;52:16;"I picked the wallet up and then I took a pause."
52:16;52:19;"Took out the license and it cold said Santa Claus."
52:19;52:21;"A million dollars in it cold, hundreds of G's."
52:21;52:24;"Enough to buy a Bowie Magic car with ease."
52:24;52:26;"But I'd never steal from Santa, 'cause Santa ain't right."
52:26;52:29;"So I was going home to mail it back to him that night."
52:29;52:33;"But when I got home I bumped, 'cause under the tree was a letter from Santa and a dose"
52:33;52:44;"from me."
52:44;52:47;"It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens."
52:47;52:49;"Mom's cooking chicken in collard greens."
52:49;52:52;"Rice and stuff and macaroni and cheese."
52:52;52:54;"And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees."
52:54;52:57;"Decorate the house with lights at night."
52:57;52:59;"Snows on the ground, snow white so bright."
52:59;53:02;"In the fireplace is the Yule log."
53:02;53:04;"Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog."
53:04;53:07;"The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of carols."
53:07;53:09;"Like each and every year we bust Christmas carols."
53:09;53:24;"Christmas carols."
53:24;53:27;"Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it."
53:27;53:29;"It's Christmas time and we got this spirit."
53:29;53:32;"Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out."
53:32;53:34;"And that's what Christmas is all about."
53:34;53:37;"The time is now, the place is here."
53:37;53:40;"And the whole wide world is filled with cheer."
53:40;53:42;"My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand."
53:42;53:45;"And I'm chillin' and coolin' just like a snowman."
53:45;53:47;"So open your eyes, let us in."
53:47;53:50;"We wanna say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"
54:15;54:18;"Okay, that was Jake's Christmas Rap Pick."
54:18;54:20;"Run D.M.C. with Christmas and Hollis."
54:20;54:21;"Big time."
54:21;54:24;"Um, okay, so Joe and Jake and everybody who's listening,"
54:24;54:27;"you guys were on the show last week, or two weeks ago."
54:27;54:32;"I had a guest on the show, one of my favorite Twitter accounts,"
54:32;54:34;"@Seinfeld2000."
54:34;54:37;"He has a Twitter where he imagines what Seinfeld would be like"
54:37;54:38;"if it was on the air today."
54:38;54:42;"And I invited him on, and it started out fine,"
54:42;54:44;"but things got a little bit weird."
54:44;54:46;"And I want to apologize to everybody who's listening"
54:46;54:48;"because it was uncomfortable."
54:48;54:52;"He really was insisting that Seinfeld was coming back on the air."
54:52;54:54;"It made me feel strange."
54:54;54:57;"My guests that week were two people who were actually on TV,"
54:57;54:59;"and it was kind of offensive that he would suggest"
54:59;55:01;"that he knew more about what was happening on TV than them."
55:01;55:03;"And also, it just wasn't happening."
55:03;55:05;"So things got weird."
55:05;55:07;"I certainly overreacted."
55:07;55:09;"I want to admit that I overreacted."
55:09;55:13;"I cut him off, I threw him off the show, and I got angry."
55:13;55:17;"So I think we were both to blame in this circumstance."
55:17;55:21;"But nobody wants to have enemies,"
55:21;55:23;"and I truly think he's a hilarious guy."
55:23;55:26;"So I reached out to Seinfeld2000 offline,"
55:26;55:28;"which is the real way to settle problems,"
55:28;55:31;"and we talked, and we realized, okay, there was a miscommunication."
55:31;55:36;"And I'm very happy to say that he's coming back on the show today."
55:36;55:37;"We hashed everything out."
55:37;55:39;"So Jerry, are you there?"
55:39;55:41;"Hello?"
55:41;55:43;"Hey, are you there, man?"
55:43;55:45;"Hey, sorry, I've got to stop this."
55:45;55:49;"Sorry, you can't be--I was actually watching an episode of Seinfeld."
55:49;55:51;"So it's not a new episode."
55:51;55:53;"It's the gum."
55:53;55:55;"I've probably seen it like 6,000 times,"
55:55;55:59;"but it'll have to do, I guess, until Seinfeld legitimately is back on TV"
55:59;56:00;"with the new episode."
56:00;56:03;"If one day, fingers crossed, it comes back,"
56:03;56:05;"but we know that that's not happening now."
56:05;56:06;"Yeah."
56:06;56:08;"Is it on Hulu or something?"
56:08;56:10;"It's on Hulu, but they're not making new ones."
56:10;56:12;"Those aren't new episodes."
56:12;56:17;"They're the classics from back in the day, obviously."
56:17;56:22;"Anyway, listen, Ezra, first of all, happy 10th show."
56:22;56:23;"Thank you."
56:23;56:25;"It's the 10th anniversary of Time Crisis."
56:25;56:26;"Congratulations."
56:26;56:27;"Thank you very much."
56:27;56:30;"On the 10th anniversary."
56:30;56:34;"Can I take a moment to actually straight-up apologize to you on the air?"
56:34;56:37;"Wow, well, yeah, I wasn't expecting that, but thanks, man, of course."
56:37;56:41;"I guess this is like a Seinfeld 2000 exclusive apology right here on Time Crisis,"
56:41;56:43;"a beach run on Apple Music."
56:43;56:46;"I feel like I wanted to come across like a Jerry,"
56:46;56:48;"but I was acting more like a Newman."
56:48;56:50;"Does that make sense?"
56:50;56:53;"I get it, man, and I just want to let you know that all is forgiven,"
56:53;56:55;"and I'm sorry for overreacting."
56:55;56:58;"I was out of line, too, so I consider you a friend."
56:58;57:00;"Things are cool between us."
57:00;57:01;"Awesome."
57:01;57:08;"I guess just like the new Justin Bieber song says in the title, I apologize."
57:08;57:09;"Okay."
57:09;57:11;"I think it's sorry, but I appreciate that."
57:11;57:15;"Okay, so I just wanted to actually, with a bit of a peace offering,"
57:15;57:18;"because, you know, my stepdad always said, like,"
57:18;57:21;"don't show up empty-handed to a party."
57:21;57:24;"So I thought we could go back to basics,"
57:24;57:27;"and I've actually just brought you the fruits of my imagination,"
57:27;57:30;"like what I do best, like what we can act over."
57:30;57:34;"I don't know if you've got your mobile phone handy,"
57:34;57:37;"but I just DMed you via Twitter."
57:37;57:39;"Oh, you DMed me? Okay."
57:39;57:42;"Yeah, I just sent you a DM of a bit of a scene,"
57:42;57:46;"actually, you know, of what Seinfeld would be like."
57:46;57:49;"You know, I usually do what it would be like if it was modern,"
57:49;57:52;"but actually this time I'm doing it like I'm flashing forward."
57:52;57:54;"I'm giving you something a little different,"
57:54;57:58;"and this is what Seinfeld would be like in 2017, just as per my imagination."
57:58;58:02;"Okay, so this is a little scene you wrote about what Seinfeld would be like in 2017."
58:02;58:06;"I love it, because this is what I find funny about your account."
58:06;58:10;"I love the imagination when you say how Seinfeld would be different."
58:10;58:12;"So this is an interesting twist, 2017."
58:12;58:14;"Okay, so it's in my DMs."
58:14;58:18;"Yeah, it's called The Galaxy, is the title of the galaxy."
58:18;58:20;"The galaxy, okay."
58:20;58:23;"The galaxy, and I was hoping you could do, you know, like the stage directions,"
58:23;58:26;"like not the character--well, you can do Jerry as well,"
58:26;58:29;"just like if you can narrate, because I'm on the phone."
58:29;58:34;"I think the quality is probably not as good, like not as studio crisp."
58:34;58:37;"Okay, sure, I'll read it. Hold on. I'm getting my DMs."
58:37;58:40;"Okay, here's The Galaxy by Seinfeld 2000."
58:40;58:44;"I love it. This is an idea about what Seinfeld would be like in 2017."
58:44;58:46;"I'm going to start reading, okay?"
58:46;58:47;"Yeah."
58:47;58:51;"The curtain raises, and we are looking at Jerry's apartment."
58:51;58:55;"Okay, usually there's not a curtain on the Seinfeld set, but okay."
58:55;58:56;"Okay."
58:56;58:59;"That's not--I mean, it doesn't say in the script to like question--"
58:59;59:01;"Okay, I'm sorry. Let me just read it. I'm sorry."
59:01;59:03;"Yeah, please proceed. Yeah, go ahead."
59:03;59:06;"The curtain raises, and we are looking at Jerry's apartment."
59:06;59:11;"Jerry is there with his squad of GFs, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne,"
59:11;59:14;"and Mulva's daughter."
59:14;59:18;"His hair is a vibrant fuchsia styled up into the dominant trend of 2017,"
59:18;59:23;"the double man bun, and he is sipping on a guava milk omega-3 smoothie."
59:23;59:27;"Even though he's well over 60, he looks fly as [bleep]"
59:27;59:32;"In the background, Cram is immersed in a virtual realty game on Oculus Rift,"
59:32;59:36;"and he's flailing wildly about its classic Cram."
59:36;59:37;"Classic?"
59:37;59:38;"Wait, I'm sorry."
59:38;59:39;"Can you see it like--huh?"
59:39;59:43;"Yeah, yeah, but it's--you wrote virtual realty."
59:43;59:46;"I imagine that's supposed to be virtual reality."
59:46;59:50;"No, it's a real estate simulation game."
59:50;59:52;"Cram is trying to get his real estate license,"
59:52;59:56;"and I don't think--was it clear that this is 2017?"
59:56;59:57;"Okay."
59:57;59:59;"He's getting his license. It's a simulation."
59:59;01:00:00;"It's a virtual realty."
01:00:00;01:00:01;"On an Oculus Rift. Okay."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Yeah, I can see how that might be a bit confusing,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"but no, it's a virtual realty game."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"That's where I found it."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"It'll be everywhere in a couple years."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Yeah."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"So Cram is playing a virtual realty game on Oculus Rift."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Okay, let me keep going."
01:00:13;01:00:17;"Elaine is there too, chilling out with the guys from Ray Shremard."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"She can't remember which member of Ray Shremard she is dating."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"Yes, the whole gang is all in Jerry Cribb,"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"except for suddenly Gurge bursts into the apartment."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"He's so excited that he literally smashes directly"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"through the locked apartment door."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"Yeah, and can--if one of your producers could add, like,"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"a smashing--like a real aggressive kind of, like,"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"a wooden door."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Okay, guys, let's get a big smashing sound."
01:00:40;01:00:46;"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"You know, this goes on for a certain time."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"Like, I'll do a shorter version, but he's yelling for, like, minutes."
01:00:50;01:00:51;"Okay, yeah, I get it. I get it."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"All right, so then I'll be Jerry responding."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"""Hey, Gurge, what are you holding in your hand?"""
01:00:55;01:00:57;"The camera zooms in on Gurge's hand."
01:00:57;01:01:02;"He's holding the Samsung Galaxy S9 Edge Plus smartphone,"
01:01:02;01:01:05;"Samsung's thinnest yet."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"It's the latest version of the product that drove Apple"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"completely out of business in Q4 of 2016."
01:01:11;01:01:14;"Okay. Okay. Is this a joke?"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"No, why are you stopping?"
01:01:16;01:01:20;"I'm stopping because you know that we're on the Apple station,"
01:01:20;01:01:24;"so this is supposed to be a joke that Samsung drove Apple"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"out of business in 2016?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Yep. Guess what?"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I'm still mad that you cut me off on your last show,"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"""Soul and Revenge."""
01:01:31;01:01:35;"I basically got you to advertise Samsung on Apple Music right now."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Okay? How are you going to explain that to your bosses?"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Okay, cut him, cut him, cut him, cut him."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"You just got owned on your own show."
01:01:41;01:01:44;"That's what happens when you humiliate Seinfeld 2000 in front of my pros."
01:01:44;01:01:47;"[Static]"
01:01:59;01:02:04;"I'm very sorry to everybody listening."
01:02:04;01:02:09;"I was tricked yet again by someone I believe to be my friend."
01:02:09;01:02:14;"Seinfeld 2000, I really thought that we turned over a new leaf,"
01:02:14;01:02:18;"and then you come on my show, you put me in a very uncomfortable position"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"with a corporation that pays for this."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"I don't know what to say."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Joe and Jake, I'm very sorry."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"I mean, that was really upsetting."
01:02:25;01:02:29;"I hated watching you fall into that trap."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"I don't even know what to do."
01:02:30;01:02:32;"I'm livid."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"Believe you me, this is not over."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"Let's get into some more music."
01:02:36;01:02:39;"Let's listen to something calming and pleasant"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"after a very unpleasant experience."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"Here's Shania Twain with ""From This Moment On."""
01:02:46;01:02:53;"But I'll always be there"

01:07:16;01:07:19;"That was Shania Twain with ""From This Moment On"""
01:07:19;01:07:21;"A beautiful song from the 90s"
01:07:21;01:07:22;"I love Shania"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"You know she's only put out four albums"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Is that true?"
01:07:25;01:07:26;"Really?"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"It's true"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"People say you gotta put out a lot of music"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"You gotta be omnipresent to be big"
01:07:30;01:07:32;"Shania's put out four albums"
01:07:32;01:07:33;"And she just plays in Vegas every night now"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"She's a hero, yeah"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"And you know her primary residence is in Switzerland"
01:07:37;01:07:38;"Really?"
01:07:38;01:07:40;"She moved there with her husband Mutt Lang"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Before the Vegas residency"
01:07:42;01:07:46;"She split her time between her house on Lake Geneva in Switzerland"
01:07:46;01:07:50;"And a like 10,000 acre sheep farm in New Zealand"
01:07:50;01:07:52;"That's alive, wow"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"She got the hell out of Canada"
01:07:53;01:07:56;"Yeah, she got the hell out of Canada"
01:07:56;01:07:58;"Being an American country singer"
01:07:58;01:08:01;"And isn't her husband Mutt Lang a super reclusive dude?"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"Yeah, they split up"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Oh, they did?"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"They split up, which is very sad"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"Or maybe that's what they had to do"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"I don't know"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"We don't know"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"My understanding is that because they have children together"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"And they're very wealthy"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"They built a kind of double house"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"So that they don't have to like live as man and wife"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"But they can kind of share space"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And the kids can run back and forth"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"That's what Affleck's doing"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"Oh really?"
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Yeah"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"He's building a double house?"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"I think so"
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Man, rich people got it figured out, man"
01:08:27;01:08:29;"Yeah, build two houses"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"Build two houses"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Square footage"
01:08:31;01:08:34;"It's very difficult for the children of divorce"
01:08:34;01:08:37;"When their parents can't afford to build a double house"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"That's true"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"And not getting a double house is really tough"
01:08:40;01:08:43;"Or maybe that's weird as hell"
01:08:43;01:08:44;"If you're like divorced parents"
01:08:44;01:08:48;"Who are just living in like different wings of a double house"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"Like when your dad has like a free weekend"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"And you can kind of see through the curtains"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"That your dad's like boning some lady that's not your mom"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"That's a nightmare"
01:08:56;01:08:59;"I'm not, I don't think this double house thing is smart"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"I don't know, I want to do some more research about it"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"I would say it don't impress me much"
01:09:02;01:09:06;"That don't impress me much"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"So you got the brains"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"But have you got the touch?"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Now don't get me wrong"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"Yeah, I think you're alright"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"But that won't keep me warm"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"In the middle of the night"
01:09:19;01:09:23;"That don't impress me much"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"You're listening to"
01:09:25;01:09:27;"Time Crisis"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"On Beast One"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"So Jake, we need a palate cleanser"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Usually you do a rock block"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"You've taught us about the Eagles, Thin Lizzy"
01:09:37;01:09:39;"But you just got back from China"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"So what you got for us today?"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Well, I thought I'd mix it up"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"I mean, when I was in China"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"I was on a panel discussion"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"With some Chinese artists there"
01:09:48;01:09:51;"And I was struck by the discussion between them"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"And it was a very political discussion they were having"
01:09:54;01:09:58;"And there was a lot of urgency in their disagreements"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"And they were talking about sort of the role of tradition"
01:10:01;01:10:03;"The role of national identity"
01:10:03;01:10:05;"The role of outside influence from the West"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"And sort of globalization"
01:10:07;01:10:10;"And some artists were very much holding on to the traditions"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"And some artists were very adamant"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"That they should sort of move forward"
01:10:14;01:10:19;"And become sort of like other international artists"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"And kind of let the past be the past"
01:10:21;01:10:24;"And they were talking about it so intensely"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"And there seemed to be very high stakes"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"In what they were discussing"
01:10:28;01:10:31;"And comparatively the American and European artists"
01:10:31;01:10:35;"Were very sort of aloof, unopinionated"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"They were just checking Instagram the whole time?"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"Yeah, just sort of a little more checked out"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"And the concerns were sort of more esoteric and aesthetic"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"And it just got me thinking about like"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"Oh well there was a time in America and in the West"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"Where people made political art"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"There were big artists making political art"
01:10:51;01:10:54;"Writing songs about war, death, inner city, whatever"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"So I don't know, I just thought I would like"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"Last night I was looking up some political songs"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"And actually last time I was on the show"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"We were talking about 1979"
01:11:02;01:11:05;"And weirdly I found some more songs from then"
01:11:05;01:11:07;"Because I guess if you're doing political songs"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"There's like one approach would be very broad"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"Which would be like John Lennon, Imagine"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"Which is sort of like"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Just like imagine if the world was better"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"Yeah, there's no materialism, no religion, no nationalism"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Right"
01:11:18;01:11:19;"And that's cool, I can get, you know"
01:11:19;01:11:20;"That's kind of an interesting thing"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Or like a band like Fugazi would do a lot of songs"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"About like anti-corporatism, anti-materialism"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"And that's cool"
01:11:26;01:11:29;"I liked it when artists, or I found it very interesting"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"When artists get super specific"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"Yeah"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"So I found two songs from 1979"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"One is called California Uber Alice"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"By the Dead Kennedys"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Oh that's from 1979"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"That's actually their first recording"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"Oh yeah, I love this song"
01:11:42;01:11:45;"I used to cover this song with my middle school punk band"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"That's amazing"
01:11:46;01:11:47;"I don't think I fully understood the implication"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"Because the title is California Uber Alice"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"Which is a riff on Deutschland Uber Alice"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Which is like a Nazi thing"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"So I was like playing it like some like barbecue or something"
01:11:55;01:11:58;"Like California Uber Alice"
01:11:58;01:11:59;"I didn't realize"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"It's like this weird riff on like the Nazis"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"I thought it was about the taxi service"
01:12:04;01:12:07;"So I'm way off"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"This is back in the era when like the punks just hated the hippies"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Right"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Which like looking back is kind of weird too"
01:12:13;01:12:17;"Like they're both sort of progressive and counterculture"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Left wing"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"Different music but like why the beef"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Right"
01:12:21;01:12:23;"And I think this song is like sort of meant as like a joke"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"But I feel like this song is basically like a working class punk dude"
01:12:27;01:12:30;"Calling out what he sees to be like these like"
01:12:30;01:12:34;"Bougie, politically correct, progressive types who are in power"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Let's listen to this song"
01:12:35;01:12:36;"Yeah, listen to this"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Let's listen to some political music"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"Here's Dead Kennedy's California Uber Alice"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"I am Governor Jerry Brown"
01:12:42;01:12:45;"I are a smile that never crowns"
01:12:45;01:12:49;"Soon I will be President"
01:12:49;01:12:54;"Now the power will soon go away"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"I will be fearer one day"
01:12:57;01:13:00;"I will command all of you"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"The kids will be ready to"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"The kids will be ready to"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"California Uber Alice"
01:13:11;01:13:12;"Uber Alice"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"California Uber Alice"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"California"
01:13:18;01:13:31;"The fascists will control you"
01:13:31;01:13:34;"100% natural"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"You will draw for the master race"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"And always wear the hat in place"
01:13:40;01:13:43;"You lose your eyes that have heard fear"
01:13:43;01:13:46;"A big furon by horses' ear"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"The hippies will come back you say"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"Then the world will throw you away"
01:13:51;01:13:54;"Then the world will throw you away"
01:13:54;01:13:57;"California Uber Alice"
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Uber Alice"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"California Uber Alice"
01:14:04;01:14:07;"California"
01:14:07;01:14:28;"Now it is 1984"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"Knock, knock at your front door"
01:14:32;01:14:36;"It's the suede denim secret police"
01:14:36;01:14:40;"They have come for your uncool neeks"
01:14:40;01:14:44;"Come quietly to the town"
01:14:44;01:14:48;"You look nice as a just ring lamp"
01:14:48;01:14:52;"Don't you worry it's only a shower"
01:14:52;01:14:55;"For your clothes it's a pretty flower"
01:14:55;01:14:59;"You're organic poisonous"
01:14:59;01:15:02;"The pigs are ready to hatch"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"You will go in a little cloud"
01:15:05;01:15:08;"With your nice big muslin frown"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"With your nice big muslin frown"
01:15:10;01:15:13;"California Uber Alice"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Uber Alice"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"California Uber Alice"
01:15:20;01:15:23;"California"
01:15:23;01:15:28;"California"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Ha ha ha ha"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"drums & guitar play rock"
01:15:33;01:15:42;"That was The Dead Kennedys"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"with California Uber Alice."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"Jake, you got some more political music?"
01:15:45;01:15:46;"I love it, these are political times."
01:15:46;01:15:48;"It's good to remember some of the"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"great political music from the past."
01:15:50;01:15:51;"And I guess what I was thinking about"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"was like, if you write a song"
01:15:53;01:15:55;"about a super specific political context,"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"you're really kind of rolling the dice"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"with how history is going to end up"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"looking at that in the future."
01:16:02;01:16:04;"You don't know how things are going to play out."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"In Djella Biafra's case,"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"I mean, that song is like,"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"I think it was kind of a joke at the time,"
01:16:09;01:16:12;"but it ends up looking pretty foolish in retrospect."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Great song, love the song."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"But it's kind of like a funny, brash thing to do."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"It's a little dated."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"And then, so the other song I was thinking about"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"was Bob Marley's Zimbabwe."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"I said it like the song, Zimbabwe."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"Right, American people say Zimbabwe."
01:16:27;01:16:28;"Zimbabwe."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"What's the correct pronunciation?"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"We were saying it in Bob Marley's Jamaican accent."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Zimbabwe."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"Oh, I see."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Zimbabwe."
01:16:36;01:16:39;"I got insecure that I've been saying it wrong forever."
01:16:39;01:16:42;"The accepted American pronunciation is Zimbabwe."
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Yeah."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"But this is also from 1979."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"Yeah, yeah."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"And that was sort of like,"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"you know, there were like Marxist, Leninist rebels"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"and guerrillas that were trying to take over"
01:16:51;01:16:54;"the minority white party that was in charge"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"of this country called Rhodesia."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Right, that was one of the most brutal"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"apartheid systems in history."
01:17:00;01:17:01;"Absolutely."
01:17:01;01:17:02;"They won, they took over."
01:17:02;01:17:04;"Bob goes over to play a show in 1980"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"to celebrate the liberation of this country."
01:17:06;01:17:07;"Right."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"It's renamed Zimbabwe."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"And then, it's all good,"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"but then Robert Mugabe takes over in 1980"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"and he's still in power 35 years later."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"And it's widely seen as one of like"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"the most terrible dictators in the world."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"He's like 92."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"I'm glad you picked this song because"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I don't even want to talk about the guy too much,"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"but one of these nutty right-wing murderers"
01:17:24;01:17:26;"that we've unfortunately had in the past couple years,"
01:17:26;01:17:29;"there's this picture of him after committing an atrocity,"
01:17:29;01:17:31;"there's a picture of him wearing a jacket"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"with the flag of Rhodesia."
01:17:33;01:17:36;"So this idea of this apartheid country"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"is still like powerful for white supremacists."
01:17:39;01:17:42;"So, you know, even in 2015, sadly."
01:17:42;01:17:43;"That's crazy."
01:17:43;01:17:45;"The idea of a song about Zimbabwe"
01:17:45;01:17:46;"is still very powerful."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"So let's listen to it, Bob Marley, Zimbabwe."

01:21:27;01:21:28;"We'll have to fight."
01:21:28;01:21:34;"in 1979. Sometimes it feels like there's less political music today than there was in the"
01:21:34;01:21:39;"past, I don't know. It's hard to say, but the first thing that came to mind when you're"
01:21:39;01:21:44;"talking about this is there's a great political song released by somebody we all know, Dev"
01:21:44;01:21:50;"Hines, aka Blood Orange, called Sandra's Smile. The Sandra referring to Sandra Bland, somebody"
01:21:50;01:21:55;"who is, at the very least, horribly mistreated by police in Texas and who knows what else?"
01:21:55;01:22:02;"And he wrote a song and he's referencing specific events. It's powerful, it's moving, and it's"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"a great song too, because that's the weird thing with political music. Somebody can have"
01:22:05;01:22:10;"a really good political intention, but if the song's whack, it weirdly does a disservice,"
01:22:10;01:22:16;"but Dev doesn't make whack songs, so let's listen to it. Here's Blood Orange with Sandra's Smile."
01:22:26;01:22:44;"Who taught you to breathe? Then took away your speech. Made you feel so loved. Then shook your hand,"
01:22:44;01:22:59;"took off your gloves. You watched her pass away. The words she said were fake. Closed"
01:22:59;01:23:15;"our eyes for a while. I still see Sandra's smile. Can you see it in my face? I've been"
01:23:15;01:23:35;"a fool to date. Hurt for me to stay in peace. Less I force myself awake. Look an hour ago,"
01:23:35;01:23:53;"I read Sabrina's quote. Why should she forgive? Reduce you if we don't. Can you see it in"
01:23:53;01:24:09;"my face? I've been a fool to date. Hurt for me to stay in peace. Less I force myself"
01:24:09;01:24:38;"awake. [Music]"
01:24:38;01:24:56;"Can you see it in my face? I've been a fool to date. Hurt for me to stay in peace. Less"
01:24:56;01:25:21;"I force myself awake. [Music]"
01:25:21;01:25:26;"That was Blood Orange with Sandra's Smile. Very powerful song, great song, amazing video,"
01:25:26;01:25:32;"amazing artist. Dev is a friend, we've been meaning to have him on the show for a minute,"
01:25:32;01:25:36;"we've been trying to have him on the show for a minute, but we wanted to hear from him"
01:25:36;01:25:41;"a little bit so we reached out to him just to get a little statement so you guys can"
01:25:41;01:25:45;"hear the person who made that song talk about it a little bit. So here's Dev talking about"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"what inspired him to write this song, Sandra's Smile."
01:25:47;01:25:54;"Hey Ezra, thanks for playing the song. Sandra's Smile was a song that came about via my reactions"
01:25:54;01:26:04;"to the Sandra Bland case. The woman, Texas, who was arrested for changing lanes illegally"
01:26:04;01:26:09;"and was put in prison and then found dead in prison where people didn't know if it was"
01:26:09;01:26:16;"a suicide or if the police had done something to her. And my views on that were that even"
01:26:16;01:26:21;"if the police didn't touch her, they still killed her by the way they treated her. And"
01:26:21;01:26:29;"so my initial thoughts when the case happened is that I was devastated of course, but it"
01:26:29;01:26:36;"took a couple of days before it really hit me in a really personal place. And so I write"
01:26:36;01:26:40;"about that in the song. I mean it's called Sandra's Smile because every photo I saw of"
01:26:40;01:26:47;"her not in prison was her smiling, this really huge and wonderful smile. I wanted to kind"
01:26:47;01:26:53;"of highlight that, like try and highlight this positive memory of her."
01:26:53;01:27:16;"Looking out at the people looking in Feeling good must be some kind of sin"
01:27:16;01:27:30;"Looking in at the people looking out Feeling guilty, scared to move about"
01:27:30;01:27:43;"Looking up at the people looking down Taking tranquilizers by the pound"
01:27:43;01:27:57;"Looking down at the people looking up Getting mad 'cause they can't get enough"
01:27:57;01:28:05;"I want you to know that green grass on the other side"
01:28:05;01:28:16;"Is just an illusion We all have our own confusion"
01:28:16;01:28:29;"We all have our own confusion Rich people watching the people poll"
01:28:29;01:28:43;"Trying to figure out how you get some more Poor people watching the people rich"
01:28:43;01:28:56;"Know they call them dirty, you know which Ugly people watching the people pretty"
01:28:56;01:29:08;"They can't get down to the nitty gritty Pretty people watching the people ugly"

01:29:30;01:29:48;"We all have our own confusion We all have our own confusion"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"That was Bill Withers with ""Green Grass."""
01:29:49;01:29:54;"We really covered a lot of ground so far on the show today."
01:29:54;01:29:58;"From political music to Seinfeld 2000, horribly tricking me."
01:29:58;01:30:02;"I think it's time for a little time crisis tradition."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"Jake, you've done this before, but Joe, you haven't."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"No."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"This is a very important part of the show where we count down the top five songs on"
01:30:09;01:30:14;"iTunes, but sometimes we like to mix it up and get a little wild with it."
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Okay."
01:30:15;01:30:16;"So get ready."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Great."
01:30:17;01:30:24;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:30:24;01:30:26;"It's time for the top five."
01:30:26;01:30:27;"This week we're doing something different."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Sometimes we like to challenge ourselves."
01:30:29;01:30:33;"So we're going to take the top five songs of this week and compare them with the top"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"five songs of the same week in 2005."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"Okay."
01:30:37;01:30:39;"We'll see what kind of difference 10 years makes."
01:30:39;01:30:44;"So if you guys want to hop in our little time machine, we're going to go back to 2005."
01:30:44;01:30:49;"This was the number five song this week in 2005."
01:30:49;01:30:54;"It's an artist I know Joe likes, Young Jeezy, Soul Survivor."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Featuring Akon."
01:30:55;01:31:08;"Akon kind of ruled this couple year period."
01:31:08;01:31:12;"♫ If you a rider, yeah, oh yes a soul survivor"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"♫ Yeah, everybody know the game don't stop"
01:31:15;01:31:19;"♫ Tryna make it to the top of your, get it, nah"
01:31:19;01:31:23;"♫ If you a rider, yeah, oh yes a soul survivor"
01:31:23;01:31:26;"♫ They can't sleep, we livin' in hell"
01:31:26;01:31:29;"♫ First they give us the work then they throw us in jail"
01:31:29;01:31:32;"♫ Roll trip, yeah I'm traffic in the white"
01:31:32;01:31:35;"♫ Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight"
01:31:35;01:31:38;"♫ Who me, I'm a soul survivor"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"♫ Axl Bottom in the street, the boy Jeezy"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"- Okay, Young Jeezy and Akon, Soul Survivor."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"It's nice to hear Akon's voice again."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- Yeah."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"- One of the greats."
01:31:46;01:31:47;"- Truly."
01:31:47;01:31:48;"- Amazing voice."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"I always think of his first single, Locked Up,"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"always pops into my head."
01:31:52;01:31:53;"- Song rules."
01:31:53;01:31:54;"- It's really burned into my brain."
01:31:54;01:31:56;"- And that video rules."
01:31:56;01:31:57;"- The Locked Up video?"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"- Yeah."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"I remember."
01:31:59;01:32:01;"- He crushed it for like a good four or five years."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"- He's amazing."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"- He was the guy."
01:32:03;01:32:07;"Every few years there was a guy that sings hooks"
01:32:07;01:32:10;"for rap songs and he was that guy for a while."
01:32:10;01:32:10;"- And he killed it."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"That's a good song."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"- And he was a polygamist."
01:32:12;01:32:13;"- Really?"
01:32:13;01:32:14;"- Yeah."
01:32:14;01:32:15;"- Many wives?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"- Mm-hmm."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"- Okay."
01:32:17;01:32:17;"- Yeah."
01:32:17;01:32:18;"- Did he choose Mormon?"
01:32:18;01:32:19;"- He was very, no."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"Akon's Mormon."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"- He's Mitt Romney's cousin."
01:32:23;01:32:24;"- Yeah."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"No, he had no shame in his game about that."
01:32:26;01:32:27;"He was like, ""Yeah, of course."""
01:32:27;01:32:29;"- As long as everybody's on the same page."
01:32:29;01:32:30;"The thing that I can't stand"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"is when you got a second family but you keep it a secret."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"- I got no respect for both."
01:32:33;01:32:35;"- No, I mean, that's not okay."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"- You gotta tell both families about each other."
01:32:36;01:32:40;"I got no respect for the hidden second family."
01:32:40;01:32:41;"- Also, by the way, as I was talking,"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"I was like, ""This probably isn't true."""
01:32:44;01:32:45;"- Oh, there you go."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"- He might not be a polygamist."
01:32:46;01:32:47;"- Yeah, it sounded like it."
01:32:47;01:32:50;"I thought I heard that but I don't, you know."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"- Don't believe everything you hear on the radio."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"We'll check it later."
01:32:53;01:32:57;"So the corresponding song in 2005"
01:32:57;01:32:58;"is a song we've heard quite a bit."

01:34:48;01:34:49;"I mean, it's 10 years old."

01:36:50;01:36:51;"- Oh, Stapleton."

01:36:52;01:36:55;"If I had to guess what genre it is,"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"I would guess country."
01:36:56;01:36:57;"- I'm guessing country."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"- But you know what?"
01:36:58;01:36:59;"- But maybe that's biased."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"- We're being judgmental."
01:37:00;01:37:01;"- We're being very judgmental."
01:37:01;01:37:02;"Have any of you guys heard of Chris Stapleton?"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"- No."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"- I've heard of Chris Stapleton."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"I don't know who the Stapleton guy is."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"- Chris Stapleton with Tennessee Whiskey."
01:37:09;01:37:11;"- It's gotta be country."
01:37:11;01:37:12;"- It's gotta be, yeah."
01:37:12;01:37:13;"- The name and then the name of the song."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"- You know what, if this song's not,"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"I hope it's hard classical."
01:37:16;01:37:17;"- It could be hard classical."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"It could be--"
01:37:18;01:37:21;"- Just instrumental harp music."
01:37:21;01:37:22;"- It could be Gregorian house."
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Could be trap music."
01:37:24;01:37:28;"I'm gonna feel like a real stupid New York liberal"
01:37:28;01:37:31;"if I made a judgment about a song called Tennessee Whiskey"
01:37:31;01:37:34;"by Chris Stapleton and it turns out to be hard classical."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"I'll feel like a real jerk."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Let's give it a listen."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"- I think you're good."

01:37:42;01:37:43;"- Wait, wait, hold on."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"Ooh, this is like a throwback."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"- This is dope."
01:37:46;01:37:50;"Chris, we knew you were gonna be country,"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"but we didn't know if you'd be dope or not."

01:38:56;01:39:00;"Okay, I think Nickelback versus Chris Stapleston."
01:39:00;01:39:01;"We have a clear winner."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- Yeah, Nickelback."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"- Oh, oh, okay. - For sure."
01:39:03;01:39:05;"- That surprised me there."
01:39:05;01:39:08;"I like, they're both basically a type of country in a way."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"- It gets weird how that lined up."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"- Yeah, we went from two hip hop songs"
01:39:12;01:39:15;"to two country songs."
01:39:15;01:39:16;"That was cool, it's like a throwback."
01:39:16;01:39:18;"It's a little old-timey."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"- Yeah, it was a little too sort of self-consciously retro."
01:39:21;01:39:22;"- It was pretty retro."
01:39:22;01:39:23;"- I mean."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"- But man, I love country music."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"I love all country music."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"- Oh, absolutely."

01:39:30;01:39:31;"- Are you a country guy?"
01:39:31;01:39:32;"- Yeah."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"- Well, okay, next."
01:39:33;01:39:34;"- You remember, it used to be a time"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"when people didn't like country?"
01:39:35;01:39:36;"- It's crazy to me."

01:39:53;01:39:55;"The number three song this week in 2005"

01:41:13;01:41:16;"I heard a dirty song the other day, My Humps."

01:41:23;01:41:24;"- Right."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"- You just have humps."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"Doesn't, you got a top hump and a bottom hump."
01:41:29;01:41:30;"- Is the head a hump?"
01:41:30;01:41:31;"Anything round?"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"- That's a great question."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"You mean he works here, we could ask him."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"- Yeah, we're literally in Will.i.am studio right now."
01:41:37;01:41:40;"Will, call in, man, we'd love to know."
01:41:40;01:41:44;"What's the counterpart to My Humps this week in 2015?"
01:41:44;01:41:46;"Well, it's something from The Voice."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"- Really?"
01:41:47;01:41:48;"- A fella by the name of Jordan Smith"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"performing a song called Halo,"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"which I believe is a Beyonce song."

01:42:53;01:42:57;"- Super high level, like a really expensive boarding school."
01:42:57;01:42:58;"- Yeah."
01:42:58;01:43:00;"- Whose team, who does he belong to?"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"Whose property is this guy?"
01:43:03;01:43:06;"- If I had to guess, he's on Adam Levine's team."
01:43:06;01:43:09;"Dollars to Donuts, that's a Levine voice."
01:43:09;01:43:10;"- Is it Levine or Levine?"
01:43:10;01:43:11;"- I think it's Levine."
01:43:11;01:43:15;"- I can't picture Adam Levine singing that song."
01:43:15;01:43:16;"- Well, okay, first of all--"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"- I mean, I can imagine he's a singer."
01:43:18;01:43:18;"I can imagine it."
01:43:18;01:43:20;"(laughing)"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"- I can't imagine it."
01:43:21;01:43:23;"- Joe has a very powerful imagination."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Okay, that's a weird one."
01:43:25;01:43:28;"My Humps Versus The Voice Performance of Halo."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"- Humps."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"- Really?"
01:43:30;01:43:31;"- Strongly."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"- That Jordan Smith's thing, that moved me."
01:43:34;01:43:35;"I'd like to invest in Jordan Smith."
01:43:35;01:43:37;"I wanna own a piece of Jordan Smith."
01:43:37;01:43:38;"Jordan Smith, if you're listening,"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"I'd love to do business with you, man."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"The number two song in 2005"
01:43:43;01:43:46;"was by a fella who's still with us today."
01:43:46;01:43:47;"I believe this is one of his first big singles."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"He goes by the name of Chris Brown,"
01:43:49;01:43:52;"and this is from his eponymous album, Chris Brown,"

01:43:56;01:43:59;"- Oh yeah, the song rules."
01:43:59;01:44:02;"- This is like before you weren't supposed"
01:44:02;01:44:03;"to hate Chris Brown."
01:44:03;01:44:08;"- Before you weren't supposed to hate Chris Brown."

01:44:15;01:44:16;"- He can sing."
01:44:16;01:44:20;"- This song was in my head for the entire year of 2005."

01:46:15;01:46:17;"he's like really good at drums."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"- And graffiti art."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"- Justin Bieber. - No one was debating"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"whether he was talented."
01:46:21;01:46:22;"The question, I mean the other guy was talented."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"- Okay, what's your question?"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"All right Jake, what's your question?"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"- Wait, who was the guy you wanted to buy stock in,"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"real low, Jordan? - Jordan Smith."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"- You wanted to buy stock in Jordan Smith."
01:46:30;01:46:34;"Joe's comment slash critique was that he was sort of"
01:46:34;01:46:37;"basically a very high-end high school talent."
01:46:37;01:46:39;"I.e. - It's gonna come back to haunt me."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"- Very technically adept,"
01:46:40;01:46:44;"but maybe lacking in any sort of personality"
01:46:44;01:46:45;"and point of view."
01:46:45;01:46:47;"And that's how I've all felt about Bieber."
01:46:47;01:46:51;"- Even with his comeback, he hasn't earned your respect."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"He's got, now he's got a story."
01:46:53;01:46:55;"- Manufactured for, I don't--"
01:46:55;01:46:56;"- Manufactured."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"You're saying he's not compelling,"
01:46:58;01:46:59;"you don't think he has personality."
01:46:59;01:47:00;"- Yeah, I don't know anything about Justin Bieber,"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"I don't follow his life."
01:47:02;01:47:03;"All I'm hearing is his music."
01:47:03;01:47:06;"He seems like a very capable singer."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"And that's all I'm saying."
01:47:07;01:47:08;"- He's got chops."
01:47:08;01:47:10;"- Yeah, I mean I feel like there's 10,000 guys"
01:47:10;01:47:11;"just like him."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"No, am I wrong?"
01:47:12;01:47:15;"- Well, even if there were 10,000 Justin Biebers,"
01:47:15;01:47:18;"only one, because this is how our society works,"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"only one of them won that spot."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"And we need to respect him because of it."
01:47:22;01:47:22;"- No we don't."
01:47:22;01:47:24;"This is, I mean, this is the argument,"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"I mean, you know, that's not interesting to me."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"- Well we live in a winner takes all society"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"and Justin Bieber's a winner."
01:47:29;01:47:32;"- Ezra, if you wanna get on the radio"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"and rationalize this terrible capitalist system we live in,"
01:47:35;01:47:36;"be my guest."
01:47:36;01:47:39;"- I just like Justin Bieber. - Wait, what was number two?"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"- So that was a Chris Brown, Justin Bieber face-off."
01:47:41;01:47:43;"All right, who won? - Oh boy."
01:47:43;01:47:44;"There's no winner here."
01:47:44;01:47:45;"I guess Bieber."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"- I mean, the funny thing is I think I go Bieber."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"- You have to. - Because like the production."
01:47:49;01:47:50;"- You have to."

01:49:20;01:49:22;"it's also one of your least favorites?"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"- I agree in the sense of I loved that song so much"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"when it first came out and it just played,"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"so it became so ubiquitous that I grew tired of it."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"- It's kind of nice."
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- Yeah, maybe that's it now."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- There's many other songs I'd rather listen to"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"from late registration than gold digger,"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"but it's not the song's fault"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"that it connected with people."
01:49:40;01:49:42;"- That's right, I don't wanna blame the song."
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Many classic lines."

01:49:54;01:49:59;"- Well, from her upcoming album, 2.5, Adele with ""Hello""."
01:49:59;01:50:00;"Could be."

01:51:32;01:51:33;"Big song."
01:51:33;01:51:35;"- Boring."
01:51:35;01:51:36;"- You find it boring?"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"- Yeah."
01:51:37;01:51:37;"- What the--"
01:51:37;01:51:38;"- I don't see the fuss."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"I mean, it's just like--"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"- Well, the voice, come on."
01:51:40;01:51:45;"- Again, I mean, to me it's like a melodramatic ballad."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"It's okay."
01:51:47;01:51:48;"There's a lot of people that sing."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"I don't know."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"It just doesn't do anything for me."
01:51:50;01:51:51;"- Joe?"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"- I don't see why she's bulletproof, Joe."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- I'm not gonna say anything bad about Adele."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"I don't need her Adele fans attacking me."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"- I don't think there's nothing bad to say."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"I love Adele."
01:52:00;01:52:01;"- She does everything right where like"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"she names her albums after like how old she is"
01:52:04;01:52:07;"and so you like track her progression"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"as not only a musician but as like a human."
01:52:09;01:52:11;"- Can you believe nobody did that before?"
01:52:11;01:52:12;"- It's crazy."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"It's so smart."
01:52:13;01:52:13;"- It's like seven up."
01:52:13;01:52:15;"- So how old is she now?"
01:52:15;01:52:16;"- Well, she's 27."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"That's a point that I've been trying to make on this show"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"is that a lot of people think that Adele"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"is the age of the album, but it's the,"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"she calls the album the number,"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"the age that she was when she first"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"cooked up a beat for the album."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"- Right."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"- So she was 25 when she started working on this."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"- To your process."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"- Yeah."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"- Jake, you don't like the trappings of this Adele song,"
01:52:35;01:52:39;"Hello, but imagine if it was like a hair metal ballad."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"(imitates guitar)"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"- Not good."

01:52:56;01:52:57;"- Oh, that's the best."

01:52:59;01:53:00;"- All music's the same."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"- And we're all the same."
01:53:01;01:53:04;"- Okay, I have a feeling who's gonna win on this panel."
01:53:04;01:53:07;"Kanye West, Gold Digger versus Adele, Hello."
01:53:07;01:53:08;"- I say Kanye."
01:53:08;01:53:08;"(laughs)"
01:53:08;01:53:09;"- Obviously."
01:53:09;01:53:13;"- Well, so all in all, was 2005 better than 2015?"
01:53:13;01:53:16;"'Cause 2005 has the Kanye and the Jeezy,"
01:53:16;01:53:17;"but it also has the Nickelback, which--"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"- That's rough."
01:53:19;01:53:19;"- Yeah."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"- I love it."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"I'm down, I think I'm--"
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- You're a 2005 guy?"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"- Yeah, living in the past."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"- Yeah, come on, man, that's just sad."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"(laughs)"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"2015, I don't know."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"- Well, guys, that was a great top five session."
