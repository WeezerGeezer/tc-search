02:04;02:05;"- A little clip from our good friend, Makonnen."
02:05;02:07;"Makonnen's not here right now."
02:07;02:09;"I tried to get him, he said he's in Paris."
02:09;02:12;"I gotta do some research to make sure that's true."
02:12;02:13;"But you know who's back?"
02:13;02:15;"We got the New York Time Crisis crew."
02:15;02:17;"Cousin Asher, what's up?"
02:17;02:18;"- What's up, Ezra?"
02:18;02:19;"- Welcome back to Time Crisis."
02:19;02:20;"- Thank you."
02:20;02:22;"- And of course, Despot, aka Alec."
02:22;02:23;"What's up, man?"
02:23;02:24;"- Hi."
02:24;02:24;"- So how's it been going, guys?"
02:24;02:26;"It's been a while."
02:26;02:27;"- Good."
02:27;02:28;"It's been a minute since you've been here."
02:28;02:29;"- I know."
02:29;02:31;"I've been out in LA, getting tan."
02:31;02:33;"- Do you feel like a trader?"
02:33;02:35;"- Yeah, well, you know what, man?"
02:35;02:37;"This is not the first time you've called me a trader."
02:37;02:37;"- I know."
02:37;02:38;"- Here's the thing."
02:38;02:40;"I'm still a New York resident."
02:40;02:42;"I'm paying income tax in New York."
02:42;02:43;"- Yeah, but that's--"
02:43;02:44;"- Doesn't that mean anything to you?"
02:44;02:45;"- No, that means nothing."
02:45;02:47;"- When the garbage man comes to take out your trash,"
02:47;02:48;"I did that."
02:48;02:50;"- I have private sanitation."
02:50;02:51;"I live in a commercial building."
02:51;02:52;"- Really?"
02:52;02:53;"- Yeah."
02:53;02:54;"So no, it doesn't mean anything to me."
02:54;02:56;"- No, the only thing that matters is if you're here for--"
02:56;02:58;"- What about the police who protect you?"
02:58;02:59;"- Yeah, thanks a lot."
02:59;03:01;"- That's not thanks to you."
03:01;03:02;"- Bad example."
03:02;03:03;"You have to be here for the winter."
03:03;03:04;"- Central Park."
03:04;03:05;"- Central Park, as a New Yorker."
03:05;03:07;"- Haven't been to Central Park in a while."
03:07;03:07;"- Yeah, I saw you."
03:07;03:10;"Next time Alec is taking his French poodle"
03:10;03:14;"for a walk in Central Park, remember I paid for that."
03:14;03:16;"- No, 'cause you didn't pay for the poodle."
03:16;03:18;"- Fair enough."
03:18;03:19;"Listen, guys, I love New York."
03:19;03:22;"I wanna spend more time here."
03:22;03:23;"- You could've probably been,"
03:23;03:27;"you maybe should've been the New York tourism ambassador"
03:27;03:29;"instead of T-Swift, but maybe because--"
03:29;03:31;"- She's spent probably a lot more time here though."
03:31;03:32;"- Yeah, you just never--"
03:32;03:33;"- No way, there is no way that Taylor Swift--"
03:33;03:34;"- Honestly, it makes a lot more sense."
03:34;03:35;"- No, there is no way."
03:35;03:37;"- All right, so explain why you're,"
03:37;03:39;"why are you not the ambassador then?"
03:39;03:40;"'Cause you're a traitor probably."
03:40;03:41;"- I'll tell you why."
03:41;03:45;"Because De Blasio, he just wants more--"
03:45;03:46;"- A pretty face."
03:46;03:47;"- He just wants a pretty face."
03:47;03:48;"(laughing)"
03:48;03:51;"I mean, I know Taylor Swift's more than a pretty face."
03:51;03:53;"It's actually really sexist, I like it."
03:53;03:57;"Disgusting, but no, I think the powers that be,"
03:57;03:59;"the people who run New York, they don't wanna see--"
03:59;04:00;"- Who are the people who run New York?"
04:00;04:01;"Jay-Z, for example?"
04:01;04:02;"- Yeah, what are the powers?"
04:02;04:04;"- Okay, good, 'cause you know who I saw last week"
04:04;04:08;"at the Beyonce show in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena?"
04:08;04:09;"Jay-Z, you know why?"
04:09;04:11;"Because Jay-Z lives in Los Angeles."
04:11;04:12;"- That's true."
04:12;04:13;"- I thought you were gonna say, ""Broke the policy."""
04:13;04:16;"- But he put a lot of time in over here first."
04:16;04:18;"- Why are you sticking up for Jay-Z?"
04:18;04:19;"- I like Jay-Z."
04:19;04:21;"- Okay, but first of all--"
04:21;04:24;"- I don't like when he said all that mean stuff about Nas."
04:24;04:26;"- Right, that's your dark taste."
04:26;04:27;"Where does Nas live?"
04:27;04:29;"- Probably here."
04:29;04:30;"- Doubt it."
04:30;04:31;"- Nah, he probably lives here."
04:31;04:32;"I'm sure he has a house out there."
04:32;04:33;"- Well, anyway, first of all--"
04:33;04:36;"- Nas does very well on the stock market."
04:36;04:36;"He has--"
04:36;04:37;"- Oh yeah, I heard he's a big investor."
04:37;04:40;"But anyway, as far as, yeah, Jay-Z put his time in here,"
04:40;04:43;"but as soon as he had a daughter, he took her to LA."
04:43;04:45;"He didn't wanna raise Blue Ivy in New York."
04:45;04:46;"- Yeah, he wants her to be soft."
04:46;04:47;"- That makes sense."
04:47;04:49;"(laughing)"
04:49;04:51;"- But I mean, she's a girl, I guess, you know."
04:51;04:52;"- That makes sense."
04:52;04:54;"If you had a daughter, you're killing me"
04:54;04:55;"with the misogyny today."
04:55;04:58;"- I'm just trying to be as sexist as possible on this show."
04:58;04:58;"- When I have, well actually,"
04:58;04:59;"I don't know where I'll raise my daughter."
04:59;05:01;"I don't wanna guarantee I'll raise my daughter in New York."
05:01;05:04;"- My daughter would definitely be raised in New York,"
05:04;05:05;"as would my son."
05:05;05:06;"- Where, there's a lot of good private schools here."
05:06;05:08;"I understand why you wanna make--"
05:08;05:09;"(laughing)"
05:09;05:10;"- What?"
05:10;05:11;"- But you're gonna make your daughter go to public school?"
05:11;05:12;"- Absolutely."
05:12;05:14;"- You're gonna make her go to New York public school?"
05:14;05:15;"- Yes."
05:15;05:15;"- Okay, I respect that."
05:15;05:18;"- You're gonna make her go to your public school in Queens?"
05:18;05:21;"- Maybe, PS 220, pretty good school."
05:21;05:24;"- If in 14 years I find out that you sent your daughter"
05:24;05:26;"to Dalton or one of these upper crust--"
05:26;05:27;"- Avenues."
05:27;05:29;"- Rich kids schools, so help me God."
05:29;05:30;"- What are you gonna do?"
05:30;05:32;"- I will play the audio of this again"
05:32;05:34;"for Time Crisis season 15."
05:34;05:35;"- It'll never happen."
05:35;05:38;"I also never have a kid, so."
05:38;05:41;"- You know, before we drop this topic,"
05:41;05:42;"I read on the internet a while ago,"
05:42;05:45;"and this really shook me to my core"
05:45;05:45;"when I first found it out,"
05:45;05:50;"that apparently Ivy, in blue Ivy,"
05:50;05:52;"stands for Illuminati's very youngest."
05:52;05:53;"- Oh yeah, I know about that."
05:53;05:54;"- And that really shook me to my core."
05:54;05:55;"And then I was talking about it"
05:55;05:57;"with somebody the other day, and they said,"
05:57;05:59;"yeah, but she's gonna have that name for her whole life,"
05:59;06:00;"and they're always gonna be adding--"
06:00;06:01;"- Exactly."
06:01;06:02;"- New members of the Illuminati,"
06:02;06:03;"so how is she still Illuminati's very youngest?"
06:03;06:04;"And I said, you know what, that makes sense."
06:04;06:06;"Maybe that's not what it stood for."
06:06;06:07;"- Yeah, maybe not."

09:29;09:30;"as much as I should have."
09:30;09:31;"I have been here more than Taylor Swift"
09:31;09:33;"and Jay-Z put together though."
09:33;09:35;"- That's definitely not true."
09:35;09:36;"- It's true. - No."
09:36;09:38;"- I pay my taxes."
09:38;09:42;"So my question for you two knuckleheads,"
09:42;09:43;"what have I been missing out on?"
09:43;09:45;"I wanna hear each of your best stories"
09:45;09:47;"of what's happened in New York in the past six months."
09:47;09:49;"Asher, we're gonna start with you."
09:49;09:51;"- My story happened to me, but it's not in New York,"
09:51;09:52;"so you're just gonna have to deal with that."
09:52;09:55;"- All right, a story that happened to a New York resident."
09:55;09:57;"- It happened to a New York resident elsewhere."
09:57;10:00;"I went with my family to the Galapagos on a vacation."
10:00;10:01;"- I can't believe that you're--"
10:01;10:03;"- Just listen, just listen, just listen."
10:03;10:05;"- I literally cannot believe that your New York story"
10:05;10:07;"is going on vacation to the Galapagos."
10:07;10:08;"Okay, but all right."
10:08;10:10;"- We had to fly into Ecuador"
10:10;10:14;"and we get in at like three o'clock in the morning"
10:14;10:16;"and we're there, the whole airport's totally empty."
10:16;10:17;"It's the middle of the night"
10:17;10:19;"and we're waiting for our luggage"
10:19;10:20;"and we hear like this crazy noise"
10:20;10:22;"on the other side of the airport door."
10:22;10:25;"And it sounds like thousands of people."
10:25;10:27;"And we open the door to leave baggage claim"
10:27;10:30;"and there are literally thousands of people in Ecuador."
10:30;10:34;"All sorts of yellow Ecuador colors and flags and everything"
10:34;10:36;"and they go crazy when we open the door."
10:36;10:39;"We could not figure it out, it was the middle of the night."
10:39;10:40;"- Time crisis fans."
10:40;10:42;"- Yeah, it was all time crisis fans."
10:42;10:43;"Very big in Ecuador."
10:43;10:45;"We walked through the whole,"
10:45;10:46;"they had cleared a path for us"
10:46;10:49;"and everyone's going crazy and jumping over each other"
10:49;10:51;"to take pictures of us and we can't figure out"
10:51;10:53;"what is going on."
10:53;10:55;"And then we get to the taxi guy"
10:55;10:56;"that's gonna take us to the hotel"
10:56;11:01;"and he tells us that, you know the soccer star Ronaldinho?"
11:01;11:02;"- Brazilian."
11:02;11:03;"- Brazilian soccer star."
11:03;11:06;"He's coming in to play a friendly match"
11:06;11:08;"with the Ecuadorian soccer team"
11:08;11:10;"and he's coming in the same,"
11:10;11:12;"a flight at the exact same time as us"
11:12;11:13;"and everyone's there in the country"
11:13;11:16;"to greet him in the middle of the night."
11:16;11:17;"And everybody thought when we opened the door it was us."
11:17;11:19;"And no one could see because of the craziness."
11:19;11:20;"So everyone thought it was us"
11:20;11:22;"and they were all going crazy."
11:22;11:24;"So we go through, everyone was so upset"
11:24;11:25;"when they realized it wasn't us."
11:25;11:28;"And we get through and we get into the taxi."
11:28;11:30;"He's explaining to us and there's people all in the streets"
11:30;11:33;"and we drive and we get to the hotel"
11:33;11:35;"and we realize that the hotel is the same hotel"
11:35;11:36;"that he's staying at."
11:36;11:37;"And it's like the middle,"
11:37;11:39;"it's like four in the morning at that point"
11:39;11:41;"and the entire front of the hotel is just swamped"
11:41;11:42;"with like thousands of people"
11:42;11:44;"and they have to like clear out a path"
11:44;11:46;"to get our car in and they get it in"
11:46;11:48;"and we can just tell like everyone's gonna be so pissed off"
11:48;11:50;"when they open the door."
11:50;11:52;"I'm Ronaldinho and everyone's going crazy"
11:52;11:55;"and they're like crying and waving all these things."
11:55;11:57;"And they open the door and people are just silent."
11:57;11:59;"They're just staring at us."
11:59;12:00;"Awkward."
12:00;12:01;"Like white family from New York"
12:01;12:03;"who just walk out and apologize to everybody."
12:03;12:04;"There you go."
12:04;12:05;"From New York."
12:05;12:06;"Yeah, exactly."
12:06;12:08;"They're back together again."
12:08;12:09;"That's a pretty wild story."
12:09;12:10;"Yeah, it was wild."
12:10;12:10;"That must have been pretty strange."
12:10;12:12;"Yeah, and then when he did come, people went crazy."
12:12;12:13;"I mean, they've--"
12:13;12:16;"Down in South America, they're gaga for soccer."
12:16;12:17;"And I've been saying this for years"
12:17;12:19;"'cause you guys know I've been all over the world."
12:19;12:21;"I've been around the world."
12:21;12:24;"And the passion I've seen for soccer"
12:24;12:25;"in some of these other countries,"
12:25;12:27;"I've been saying this for years."
12:27;12:30;"One day, soccer could be the number one sport in the world."
12:30;12:31;"(laughing)"
12:31;12:33;"What day is that?"
12:33;12:34;"I don't know."
12:34;12:36;"Probably around the time that Despot has a daughter."
12:36;12:38;"And an album."
12:38;12:41;"At Fieldston."
12:41;12:43;"An album at Fieldston."
12:43;12:45;"Yeah, actually, Despot needs to make an album"
12:45;12:47;"before he has a daughter."
12:47;12:47;"That's fair."
12:47;12:49;"Well, anyway."
12:49;12:52;"Despot, your story needs to take place in New York"
12:52;12:53;"after Asher took--"
12:53;12:54;"I didn't know that was a requirement."
12:54;12:55;"I didn't realize that was a requirement."
12:55;12:56;"I didn't even prep you properly."
12:56;12:57;"You didn't prep me, I'm sorry."
12:57;12:59;"You just said the best story of the last six months."
12:59;12:59;"Okay."
12:59;13:00;"I wasn't--"
13:00;13:01;"Despot, what's been going on with you?"
13:01;13:03;"What's your best story the past six months?"
13:03;13:05;"I don't really have a story."
13:05;13:07;"I also don't really remember"
13:07;13:10;"too much of what's been happening."
13:10;13:10;"Why?"
13:10;13:12;"I've been drinking a lot"
13:12;13:15;"and going out and staying out late a lot."
13:15;13:17;"Coming home at eight in the morning a lot."
13:17;13:19;"But still keeping up with my fitness."
13:19;13:21;"That was my first question,"
13:21;13:22;"'cause you know on Time Crisis,"
13:22;13:24;"health and fitness is very important to us."
13:24;13:26;"So, you were doing P90X,"
13:26;13:27;"you were getting like real diesel."
13:27;13:28;"Still am."
13:28;13:30;"With all the drinking, you can still stay diesel?"
13:30;13:33;"Yeah, it kinda helps to sweat the hangover out."
13:33;13:36;"Just pump some iron."
13:36;13:38;"Is it safe to do that forever?"
13:38;13:41;"Isn't the point of P90X, you do it for 90 days and then--"
13:41;13:42;"Nah, you do it forever."
13:42;13:43;"Oh, really?"
13:43;13:44;"You could do it--"
13:44;13:44;"P forever."
13:44;13:46;"What do you say after you do like--"
13:46;13:49;"Oh, the X is like, oh, X, X, infinity."
13:49;13:50;"I see."
13:50;13:53;"I did X3 first, then did X2,"
13:53;13:55;"then I did regular X."
13:55;13:56;"Now I'm just kinda mixing it up."
13:56;13:58;"What's the difference between X, X2, X3?"
13:58;13:59;"I'm glad you asked."
13:59;14:02;"X3 is only a half hour,"
14:02;14:05;"more of a beginner, intermediate thing."
14:05;14:08;"Kind of intense, but a half hour."
14:08;14:11;"Then X2 is probably the most difficult."
14:11;14:14;"It's very like acrobatic."
14:14;14:16;"Like you'll be balancing on one of those bouncy balls"
14:16;14:18;"and lifting weights and whatever"
14:18;14:20;"and doing all this crazy stuff."
14:20;14:23;"And then X is more traditional."
14:23;14:24;"You just max out."
14:24;14:26;"It's like do a million curls, do a million--"
14:26;14:29;"So basically for the past six months,"
14:29;14:31;"you've been working out all day,"
14:31;14:34;"partying all night, and you remember nothing."
14:34;14:35;"I don't remember too much."
14:35;14:37;"And the things that I do remember"
14:37;14:40;"are mostly like incriminating,"
14:40;14:42;"like a lot of illegal things."
14:42;14:44;"I broke the law a lot."
14:44;14:44;"X4."
14:44;14:46;"Especially in like the past month,"
14:46;14:48;"I really been breaking the law a lot."
14:48;14:49;"And yeah, I don't know."
14:49;14:50;"Well, we won't make you say anymore."
14:50;14:52;"I'll say, you know, I went,"
14:52;14:53;"it was just my birthday."
14:53;14:55;"I just turned 34."
14:55;14:55;"Oh, happy birthday, man."
14:55;14:56;"Happy birthday."
14:56;14:57;"Thanks."
14:57;14:59;"The night of my birthday,"
14:59;15:02;"well, no, the night before my birthday, May 6th,"
15:02;15:06;"I was feeling like a little, I don't know,"
15:06;15:08;"messed up from whatever I've been doing."
15:08;15:11;"And I went to a Dizzy Rascal show."
15:11;15:13;"He played the entire ""Boy in the Corner"" album."
15:13;15:14;"Great album."
15:14;15:16;"Yeah, and in my head, I was like,"
15:16;15:19;"this is gonna be weird 'cause I'm turning really old"
15:19;15:23;"and I'm gonna go see this guy play this album"
15:23;15:24;"from a long time ago."
15:24;15:25;"And I'm gonna feel old."
15:25;15:27;"Even Dizzy Rascal, he was a teenager"
15:27;15:28;"when he made that album."
15:28;15:29;"Yeah."
15:29;15:32;"So I went to the show kind of expecting"
15:32;15:34;"to just like feel weird and bad."
15:34;15:37;"And I did feel weird and bad,"
15:37;15:40;"but it was a really good show."
15:40;15:43;"And it was, I would say it was inspiring."
15:43;15:46;"And then it became my birthday during the show."
15:46;15:50;"And I was like, man, hey, you're not so old and washed up."
15:50;15:52;"You could like make some rap songs"
15:52;15:54;"and do your thing and be 34."
15:54;15:56;"So ultimately you felt good?"
15:56;15:57;"I felt good."
15:57;16:00;"I said hi to a lot of people who were saying hi to me"
16:00;16:02;"and I didn't know who they were."
16:02;16:03;"And that feels good."
16:03;16:04;"That was good."
16:04;16:05;"Yeah, that feels great."
16:05;16:06;"Yeah, it's positive."
16:06;16:07;"Yeah."
16:07;16:08;"As a birthday gift to you,"
16:08;16:11;"because you survived another year"
16:11;16:13;"and you rung in the new year with Dizzy Rascal."
16:13;16:15;"I wanna dedicate a Dizzy Rascal song to you."
16:15;16:18;"I was thinking ""Fix Up, Look Sharp,"""
16:18;16:21;"which is one of the less known songs on that album."
16:21;16:23;"So corny, Ezra."
16:23;16:24;"What is that sample?"
16:24;16:25;"That sample's Big Beat, right?"
16:25;16:27;"Yeah, Billy Squire."
16:27;16:27;"Could play that."
16:27;16:30;"That song, Upper West Side Resident."
16:30;16:33;"I feel like a song just came out that samples Big Beat."
16:33;16:35;"And I feel like every year a song comes out."
16:35;16:36;"They're always sampling Big Beat."
16:36;16:37;"Wait, okay."
16:37;16:38;"No, she doesn't even sample it."
16:38;16:39;"It's just called Big Beat."
16:39;16:39;"Oh, it's just called Big Beat."
16:39;16:41;"But no, but there is another one that just came out."
16:41;16:42;"There's always something."
16:42;16:43;"Yeah."
16:43;16:46;"So, happy 34th birthday to Death Spot."

23:50;23:52;"Good pick, man."
23:52;23:52;"- Thanks."
23:52;23:55;"- So, while you guys have been over here"
23:55;23:58;"going to Ecuador and Dizzee Rascal concerts,"
23:58;24:00;"I've been putting in some real work."
24:00;24:03;"Over on the West Coast, recording ""Tom Crisis,"""
24:03;24:04;"recording music."
24:04;24:07;"- I'd gladly go record ""Tom Crisis"" with you over there."
24:07;24:09;"- Yeah, any time you wanna."
24:09;24:11;"- Okay, I'm making a promise."
24:11;24:12;"I'll make a promise."
24:12;24:16;"I'm gonna fly you two knuckleheads out to Hollywood."
24:16;24:18;"- Maybe get a nice Airbnb or something."
24:18;24:22;"- But if they don't, I will put out my hard-earned cash."
24:22;24:23;"- That's nice of you."
24:23;24:25;"- That Airbnb's gonna suck."
24:25;24:27;"- I can already tell that Airbnb's gonna suck."
24:27;24:27;"- It's gonna be a good Airbnb."
24:27;24:28;"- Just gotta have a pool."
24:28;24:29;"- Do we get to choose?"
24:29;24:30;"- A pool."
24:30;24:31;"- No, I wanna surprise you guys."
24:31;24:33;"- Can we pick the neighborhood?"
24:33;24:34;"- I don't know, what neighborhood do you wanna stay in?"
24:34;24:35;"- Malibu."
24:35;24:36;"- You don't wanna stay in Malibu."
24:36;24:38;"- Nah, it's too far, Glendale."
24:38;24:39;"- See, you guys don't know about,"
24:39;24:40;"I think Glendale, see?"
24:40;24:41;"(laughing)"
24:41;24:44;"You guys don't know about LA stuff."
24:44;24:45;"I'm over,"
24:45;24:46;"(laughing)"
24:46;24:49;"Malibu's really far from Glendale."
24:49;24:50;"That's some LA stuff that I know."
24:50;24:53;"- I know, if you ever need to be a house from Malibu,"
24:53;24:54;"we don't ever have to leave the house."
24:54;24:55;"- You know what, Alex?"
24:55;24:55;"- Just put us in Silver Lake."
24:55;24:57;"- I'm gonna put you, you my friend,"
24:57;24:59;"I'm putting in historic Filipino town."
24:59;25:00;"- Okay, I've been there."
25:00;25:01;"- Asher?"
25:01;25:02;"- Little Armenia."
25:02;25:05;"- I'm gonna put you over by the airport."
25:05;25:06;"- Oh, come on."
25:06;25:07;"(laughing)"
25:07;25:08;"It's the holiday inn."
25:08;25:11;"- No, I was thinking Marina Del Rey, how's that?"
25:11;25:12;"- Oh, that's okay."
27:01;27:16;"- Anyway, so while I'm gonna bring you guys out,"
27:16;27:17;"I like that idea."
27:17;27:18;"- Yeah, me too."
27:18;27:20;"- But you could have done it in the winter."
27:20;27:22;"- You know what, guys?"
27:22;27:24;"- It's beautiful in New York now, I don't wanna leave now."
27:24;27:26;"- Okay, we'll figure it out, we'll figure it out."
27:26;27:30;"- Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
27:30;27:33;"- Filling in for our regular host, Farid Zakaria."
27:33;27:35;"- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
27:35;27:36;"- Beats."
27:36;27:36;"(horn blaring)"
27:36;27:37;"One."
27:37;27:39;"- You know, in New York, everybody's always talking"
27:39;27:42;"about pizza, hot dogs, and you know, whatever."
27:42;27:44;"Philosophy, things like that."
27:44;27:45;"But in LA--"
27:45;27:46;"- I thought you were gonna say falafels."
27:46;27:46;"- And falafels."
27:46;27:48;"- And then you said philosophy."
27:48;27:49;"- Falafel, see?"
27:49;27:52;"- And then, but in LA, we've been getting into"
27:52;27:56;"a conversation about Doritos versus Fritos."
27:56;27:58;"And you know, our West Coast correspondent,"
27:58;27:59;"Jake Longstreth, been doing some work"
27:59;28:01;"talking about Doritos versus Fritos."
28:01;28:05;"So I wanna call Jake to kinda take the discussion"
28:05;28:07;"a bit deeper, but before we do that,"
28:07;28:08;"I was just wondering, were you guys,"
28:08;28:10;"Asher, are you more Doritos guy or Fritos guy?"
28:10;28:11;"- You know what I am?"
28:11;28:13;"I'm a Fritos, they got the barbecue,"
28:13;28:16;"they have a honey barbecue flavor of Fritos"
28:16;28:16;"that's like--"
28:16;28:17;"- Really?"
28:17;28:18;"- Yeah, it's totally different."
28:18;28:20;"It's like honey almost, it's like a corkscrew shape."
28:20;28:23;"And they have this fake barbecue char on it."
28:23;28:24;"- Too sweet?"
28:24;28:25;"- It looks crazy."
28:25;28:25;"No, it's just sweet enough."
28:25;28:26;"It's a little sweet."
28:26;28:28;"- Is that something you can just walk into a store"
28:28;28:31;"and get that, or are you ordering that in bulk from Korea?"
28:31;28:33;"- If you go to a vending machine at a public school,"
28:33;28:34;"you will definitely be able to get that."
28:34;28:35;"- Go to Alibaba."
28:35;28:36;"- What are you doing in public school?"
28:36;28:37;"- No, I'm just saying I grew up eating that"
28:37;28:38;"like every single day."
28:38;28:40;"- Wait, those existed when we were kids?"
28:40;28:40;"- Yeah, definitely."
28:40;28:41;"- Barbecue Fritos."
28:41;28:42;"- Yeah."
28:42;28:43;"- Yeah."
28:43;28:44;"- I never heard about that one."
28:44;28:46;"I was eating grandma's cookies."
28:46;28:49;"That was my vending machine snack of choice"
28:49;28:50;"at my public high school."
28:50;28:53;"- Well, we lived about five miles away, but worlds apart."
28:53;28:54;"- Well, that's true."
28:54;28:56;"- Is grandma's cookies like the butter crunch"
28:56;28:57;"in those things?"
28:57;28:58;"Nah, right?"
28:58;28:59;"- You get two big cookies in a pack."
28:59;29:00;"- I think that's it."
29:00;29:01;"- They also did a chocolate one."
29:01;29:03;"- Yeah, the chocolate and chocolate."
29:03;29:05;"- And they also did a chocolate chip, I believe."
29:05;29:06;"- Yeah, and butter crunch."
29:06;29:07;"- Yeah, I think they might even have done a peanut butter."
29:07;29:09;"- Unless I got it wrong."
29:09;29:11;"- Alec, are you more of a Doritos?"
29:11;29:12;"- Absolutely."
29:12;29:13;"- Doritos hamster."
29:13;29:13;"- Cool ranch or nacho cheese?"
29:13;29:16;"- Doritos definitely fits more with your bad boy image."
29:16;29:16;"- Thank you."
29:16;29:17;"(laughing)"
29:17;29:19;"- I saw that one coming a mile away."
29:19;29:21;"Wait, but here's my question."
29:21;29:22;"Which type of Doritos?"
29:22;29:23;"Cool ranch?"
29:23;29:25;"- Nah, I kinda like nacho cheese"
29:25;29:27;"if I'm going for one or the other of the classics."
29:27;29:28;"- Really?"
29:28;29:29;"- Yeah."
29:29;29:30;"- That's crazy."
29:30;29:30;"- I kinda would go nacho cheese."
29:30;29:32;"- On that note, let's call our West Coast correspondent,"
29:32;29:35;"Jake Longstreth, to get some real dirt"
29:35;29:38;"on the Doritos Fritos universe."
29:38;29:41;"- Now, let's go into the Time Crisis Hotline."
29:41;29:43;"(beeping)"
29:44;29:46;"(phone ringing)"
29:46;29:48;"- Hey, Ezra."
29:48;29:50;"- Hey, what's up, Jake?"
29:50;29:52;"You're on with the Time Crisis New York crew,"
29:52;29:54;"Despot and Asher."
29:54;29:56;"- Oh, cool, old school."
29:56;29:57;"- Exactly."
29:57;29:59;"So Jake, we were just talking about Doritos and Fritos,"
29:59;30:04;"and the fan response to the last show, it was unreal."
30:04;30:05;"You know, while the show was airing,"
30:05;30:08;"briefly, #DoritosVsFritos."
30:08;30:10;"- Wait, what's your position?"
30:10;30:11;"You didn't even say."
30:11;30:13;"- Well, you know I'm agnostic on everything."
30:13;30:13;"- Okay."
30:13;30:16;"- If the Frito-Lay company decides that they want me"
30:16;30:18;"to be the face of Fritos or Doritos,"
30:18;30:20;"the last thing that I need is somebody"
30:20;30:24;"digging up an old radio show where I chose sides."
30:24;30:25;"- I mean, regardless, you're kind of--"
30:25;30:27;"- Yeah, you're a Frito-Lays boy either way."
30:27;30:30;"- No, but you're being divisive here,"
30:30;30:32;"so the company might not appreciate that either way."
30:32;30:36;"- I guess I am inviting criticism of their products."
30:36;30:37;"- Encouraging an atmosphere of intolerance."
30:37;30:38;"- Okay, I like Doritos."
30:38;30:40;"- Good, well said."
30:40;30:41;"- So Jake--"
30:41;30:42;"- It was a very political answer."
30:42;30:46;"- So Jake, as I said, people are going crazy."
30:46;30:49;"#DoritosVsFritos got over two million tweets."
30:49;30:51;"It was trending in 70 countries."
30:51;30:53;"People are going crazy about this discussion."
30:53;30:56;"It really struck a nerve with the citizens of Earth."
30:56;30:58;"We understand you've been digging a little bit deeper."
30:58;31:00;"You got some good facts for us?"
31:00;31:01;"- Oh yeah."
31:01;31:02;"- All right, lay it on us."
31:02;31:03;"- Wait, how about you?"
31:03;31:07;"What do you like better, Doritos or Fritos, man?"
31:07;31:09;"- We discussed this, and I think as a child"
31:09;31:11;"I would have gone with Doritos, but as an adult,"
31:11;31:13;"a self-restrainting adult, I would go Fritos."
31:13;31:14;"- That's interesting."
31:14;31:18;"Is that just because of getting the stuff on your fingers?"
31:18;31:22;"- Yeah, it's just that Doritos are over the top."
31:22;31:22;"- Yeah."
31:22;31:23;"- It's not a good look."
31:23;31:26;"What if one of your friends pulls up in a Lamborghini"
31:26;31:28;"and you have to wave at them?"
31:28;31:30;"And all your fingertips are all orange."
31:30;31:33;"- Or if you get caught licking that off or something."
31:33;31:33;"That's really gross."
31:33;31:34;"- Yeah, you're just licking it."
31:34;31:35;"It's not a good look."
31:35;31:36;"- That's disgusting."
31:36;31:38;"- All right, so Jake, what did you find out"
31:38;31:40;"about Fritos and Doritos?"
31:40;31:41;"- Where to start?"
31:41;31:44;"I mean, this was like an epic history, as you might imagine."
31:44;31:45;"For the sake of brevity,"
31:45;31:47;"let me just hit you with some bullet points."
31:47;31:48;"- Nice."
31:48;31:52;"- Fritos was invented in the '30s in San Antonio, Texas."
31:52;31:53;"- '30s, wow."
31:53;31:56;"- Meanwhile, in North Carolina,"
31:56;31:58;"the Lay's Potato Chip Corporation"
31:58;32:01;"was just getting going in the '30s as well."
32:01;32:02;"- So two different companies."
32:02;32:04;"- Yeah, yeah, the Frito Company"
32:04;32:07;"and the Lay's Potato Chip Company were separate companies,"
32:07;32:09;"and they were very successful regionally."
32:09;32:14;"And then in 1961, they merged to form Frito-Lay."
32:14;32:16;"And then four years after that,"
32:16;32:18;"it started to get super global and corporate"
32:18;32:22;"because Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola Company,"
32:22;32:23;"forming PepsiCo."
32:23;32:26;"- Wait, Frito-Lay's is owned by Pepsi still?"
32:26;32:28;"- PepsiCo, yeah."
32:28;32:29;"Still is."
32:29;32:31;"- I think they also own like Pizza Hut, maybe Taco Bell."
32:31;32:32;"There's like a--"
32:32;32:33;"- No, no, no."
32:33;32:34;"- There's some weird--"
32:34;32:36;"- Well, they did until 1997, but that's all for another episode."
32:36;32:38;"- I don't think I've checked since 1997."
32:38;32:41;"- All right, so PepsiCo, so Frito-Lay,"
32:41;32:42;"they come together, they're a powerhouse."
32:42;32:44;"PepsiCo says, ""You know what, guys?"
32:44;32:46;"""We could take this even further."""
32:46;32:48;"Becomes a global brand."
32:48;32:51;"- Yeah, as of 2009, PepsiCo comprised 40%"
32:51;32:54;"of all savory snacks sold in the United States."
32:54;32:56;"- Wow."
32:56;32:59;"- And initially, there was this guy named Donald Kendall"
32:59;33:01;"who was really tight with Richard Nixon."
33:01;33:02;"- Oh, God."
33:02;33:04;"- He was the CEO of PepsiCo."
33:04;33:07;"He was, and actually Nixon was PepsiCo's company lawyer"
33:07;33:09;"in the mid '60s."
33:09;33:12;"And PepsiCo in the late '60s was thinking"
33:12;33:15;"of marketing potato chips and Pepsi products together"
33:15;33:19;"in the same advertisements because, to quote Donald Kendall,"
33:19;33:20;"""Potato chips make you thirsty,"
33:20;33:22;"""and Pepsi satisfies thirst."""
33:22;33:25;"(laughing)"
33:25;33:25;"- Oh my God."
33:25;33:26;"- So you're telling me--"
33:26;33:27;"- That's called synergy."
33:27;33:28;"- Okay, so you're telling me,"
33:28;33:31;"so these guys basically invented a certain form"
33:31;33:34;"of corporate synergy."
33:34;33:37;"They give you the taste of a Dorito or a Frito,"
33:37;33:38;"you get thirsty."
33:38;33:39;"- Right."
33:39;33:41;"- Now they're hitting you with Pepsi,"
33:41;33:42;"which is full of sugar,"
33:42;33:44;"which is gonna totally destroy your metabolism"
33:44;33:46;"and then make you wanna eat more carbs."
33:46;33:48;"- It's insane, and it goes so deep."
33:48;33:50;"I mean, I went down the rabbit hole"
33:50;33:51;"this afternoon with this stuff."
33:51;33:53;"- Normally when people say that something goes really deep,"
33:53;33:55;"the next line is, ""I think it goes all the way"
33:55;33:56;"""to the very top."""
33:56;33:59;"And in this instance, it literally did go all the way"
33:59;34:02;"to the very top to the President of the United States."
34:02;34:04;"So I'm picturing in my mind's eye"
34:04;34:08;"that a bunch of these corporate scumbags at PepsiCo"
34:08;34:11;"were like, ""Nixon, you're a hell of a lawyer,"
34:11;34:14;"""but we need a man on the inside."
34:14;34:16;"""We wanna put you in the White House."""
34:16;34:18;"And he's like, ""Guys, I ran for President before."
34:18;34:19;"""It didn't go very well."
34:19;34:21;"""Nixon, we need you in the White House."
34:21;34:24;"""We need a strong advocate for Pepsi"
34:24;34:25;"""and Frito-Lay products."""
34:25;34:26;"And they did it."
34:26;34:28;"- Dude, you are more right than you know."
34:28;34:30;"(laughing)"
34:33;34:38;"the White House. (upbeat music)"
35:11;35:24;"♪ Now Muscle Shoals is gonna swamp us ♪"
35:24;35:29;"♪ They've been known to piss on the tooth ♪"
35:29;35:33;"- This guy Donald Kendall, who was the CEO of PepsiCo,"
35:33;35:35;"so Nixon elected in '68."
35:35;35:38;"Kendall called Nixon in 1970"
35:38;35:41;"after Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile."
35:41;35:42;"- Oh God."
35:42;35:45;"- Who was a very Marxist dude."
35:45;35:46;"- A lefty."
35:46;35:47;"- Yeah, he was gonna nationalize everything"
35:47;35:49;"and kick out American corporations."
35:49;35:54;"And there was a big PepsiCo bottling plant in Chile."
35:54;35:55;"And he was gonna boot them out."
35:55;35:57;"And then Kendall called Nixon."
35:57;36:00;"And so they were old buddies via the PepsiCo board."
36:00;36:01;"- No."
36:01;36:03;"- He was like, ""This is not gonna stand, dude."""
36:03;36:05;"And then in '73, the CIA helped with the coup"
36:05;36:07;"to oust Allende."
36:07;36:08;"- Oh my God."
36:08;36:12;"So you're telling me literally PepsiCo,"
36:12;36:17;"and by extension Fritos, Lays, and Doritos,"
36:17;36:18;"is pro-regime change."
36:18;36:20;"- Yeah, I mean, you think about PepsiCo"
36:20;36:23;"being a very powerful American brand."
36:23;36:25;"You think about the Cold War,"
36:25;36:28;"and you think about economic and political imperialism."
36:28;36:31;"It makes sense that PepsiCo's right in the mix"
36:31;36:34;"with the top dogs of politics."
36:34;36:35;"It's heavy, dude."
36:35;36:36;"- Man, is it?"
36:36;36:37;"(laughing)"
36:37;36:38;"- That's one endorsement you're not gonna get."
36:38;36:40;"- Jake, I got a question for you, man."
36:40;36:43;"If you're a peace-loving cola drinker"
36:43;36:48;"who doesn't wanna see Marxist rebels getting murdered,"
36:48;36:50;"I mean, good Lord, is there a cola"
36:50;36:51;"that we can drink and feel good about?"
36:51;36:52;"- Tropical Fantasy."
36:52;36:54;"- Maybe, you know, I think Peter Joes has a line of--"
36:54;36:56;"- Joes, I was gonna say."
36:56;36:56;"- Joes Cola."
36:56;36:58;"- What's that?"
36:58;36:59;"- Joes Cola."
36:59;37:00;"- I've never even heard of that."
37:00;37:03;"- It's like the Bernie Sanders of cola."
37:03;37:05;"- Right, maybe Shasta."
37:05;37:07;"- Tropical Fantasy, man, they make a cola."
37:07;37:09;"- What about RC Cola?"
37:09;37:10;"- I don't know, I think RC is probably--"
37:10;37:11;"- Isn't it?"
37:11;37:13;"- The RC stands for Really Communist."
37:13;37:15;"- What about Faygo?"
37:15;37:17;"- Oh yeah, maybe Faygo's still a regional brand."
37:17;37:18;"- Is that cola?"
37:18;37:19;"I don't even know."
37:19;37:20;"- They probably make a cola."
37:20;37:22;"Jake, thank you so much for your in-depth reporting, man."
37:22;37:25;"I gotta say that finding out some of these"
37:25;37:28;"horrifying skeletons in PepsiCo's closet,"
37:28;37:32;"it kinda makes the whole Doritos versus Doritos debate"
37:32;37:33;"seem a little slight."
37:33;37:36;"- Ezra, do you have any idea how many different varieties"
37:36;37:37;"of Doritos have been introduced"
37:37;37:39;"onto the market internationally?"
37:39;37:40;"- How many?"
37:40;37:41;"- 106."
37:41;37:45;"- They wanna give us 106 different choices of Doritos,"
37:45;37:48;"but we can't even choose Marxism?"
37:48;37:50;"We get one choice of ideology,"
37:50;37:52;"but 106 choices of Doritos."
37:52;37:55;"- Will you tell us some of the more rare Doritos flavors?"
37:55;37:57;"- I found a site today called taquito.net,"
37:57;38:00;"which is sort of the IMDB of snack food."
38:00;38:01;"- Hell yeah. - Oh, okay."
38:01;38:03;"- We just read a few of these."
38:03;38:05;"There's 106 different varieties,"
38:05;38:06;"and a lot of these are international."
38:06;38:09;"Doritos first degree burn, blazin' jalapeno."
38:09;38:11;"(laughing)"
38:11;38:15;"Doritos second degree burn, fiery buffalo."
38:15;38:17;"(laughing)"
38:17;38:21;"Doritos third degree burn, scorchin' habanero."
38:21;38:21;"- I've had that one."
38:21;38:23;"- Doritos baja picante."
38:23;38:26;"Doritos baked cooler ranch tortilla chips."
38:26;38:28;"- Dude, there's one that's peaking duck."
38:28;38:30;"(laughing)"
38:30;38:34;"- Have you seen the Doritos roulette chips?"
38:34;38:35;"Do you guys know about this?"
38:35;38:36;"- Where you don't know what you're gonna get?"
38:36;38:38;"- Yeah, no, no, no, it's amazing."
38:38;38:39;"They launched in Canada,"
38:39;38:40;"and then I think they brought them here,"
38:40;38:42;"but it didn't last very long."
38:42;38:43;"It's called Doritos roulette,"
38:43;38:46;"and the idea is it's a normal bag of Doritos,"
38:46;38:51;"and then six chips in the bag are inedibly spicy."
38:51;38:52;"(laughing)"
38:52;38:53;"And you just have no idea."
38:53;38:55;"They all look the same, so you just eat them,"
38:55;38:57;"and it became a YouTube cult sensation"
38:57;39:01;"of people filming themselves eating a bag of roulette chips"
39:01;39:02;"so that you're just eating them,"
39:02;39:04;"and you don't know when it's gonna happen,"
39:04;39:06;"and then it happens, and they just lose their,"
39:06;39:07;"you know, it's like those ghost pepper videos."
39:07;39:09;"- It sounds like there's a lot of creativity"
39:09;39:11;"going on over at Doritos."
39:11;39:14;"- Yeah, I think they're taking it as far as they can go."
39:14;39:16;"- All of this is available on Amazon, apparently."
39:16;39:19;"There's a real Doritos subculture."
39:19;39:22;"- So there's just some dudes just Amazon priming"
39:22;39:24;"Doritos peaking duck."
39:24;39:24;"- Yeah."
39:24;39:26;"- By the case."
39:26;39:27;"- I want that."
39:27;39:30;"- I'm reading the review now of Doritos roulette,"
39:30;39:31;"and it just sounds--"
39:31;39:33;"(laughing)"
39:33;39:34;"- All right, but Jake."
39:34;39:35;"- Very intriguing."
39:35;39:37;"- But Jake, I mean, we're talking about the positive"
39:37;39:37;"side of Doritos."
39:37;39:42;"I just wanna know, has Doritos or PepsiCo ever apologized"
39:42;39:44;"for getting mixed up in horrendous things?"
39:44;39:46;"- I didn't see any reference to that."
39:46;39:48;"I mean, that would be surprising if they did."
39:48;39:50;"I feel like those kind of stories,"
39:50;39:52;"people just kind of like scoff at."
39:52;39:54;"- Yeah, people probably don't even really believe it."
39:54;39:57;"- Okay, dude, that PepsiCo CEO is on the Watergate tapes."
39:57;39:58;"- Oh my God."
39:58;40:00;"- He's like hanging with Nixon in the White House."
40:00;40:03;"- This truly went all the way to the very top."
40:03;40:06;"Jake, thank you so much for your in-depth reporting,"
40:06;40:09;"and I just wanna say to everybody out there,"
40:09;40:11;"we've been talking about some pretty exciting flavors"
40:11;40:12;"of Doritos on the show today,"
40:12;40:15;"but I want you to go read about these things"
40:15;40:16;"that Jake's talking about,"
40:16;40:18;"because I want you to think about it."
40:18;40:20;"Your consumer choices do make an impact,"
40:20;40:22;"you know what I'm saying?"
40:22;40:23;"- Real."
40:23;40:25;"- All right, Jake, I'll see you in two weeks,"
40:25;40:27;"and I wanna take this discussion even further,"
40:27;40:28;"if it's possible."
40:28;40:29;"- Would love to."
40:29;40:32;"- All right, man, see you back in California."
40:32;40:33;"- Bye, Jake. - All right, peace."
40:33;40:34;"- Bye, Jake. - Bye, guys."

43:48;43:50;"about the PepsiCo company,"
43:50;43:52;"he couldn't bring himself to eat his usual."
43:52;43:53;"- We threw out all of the Doritos."
43:53;43:56;"- Third degree burn Doritos and he's eating pop chips."
43:56;43:57;"How are those pop chips?"
43:57;43:59;"- Nah, I don't really like them."
43:59;44:01;"- I think Katy Perry owns part of pop chips."
44:01;44:02;"How do you like them now?"
44:02;44:03;"- I don't really like them."
44:03;44:04;"- You have no re--"
44:04;44:07;"(laughing)"
44:07;44:11;"- Isn't Katy Perry one of the white female singers"
44:11;44:14;"that rappers use to refer to?"
44:14;44:15;"Like I got that Katy Perry."
44:15;44:18;"- Yeah, yeah, one of my favorite Wayne lines."
44:18;44:20;"You could get buried for an ounce of Katy Perry."
44:20;44:22;"- Right, exactly, there you go."
44:22;44:24;"That's cool, I like that about her."
44:24;44:30;"- My favorite, my favorite thing about Katy Perry"
44:30;44:31;"is when she's--"
44:31;44:33;"- Yeah, I don't really know anything else about her."
44:33;44:34;"- I don't know any other people's songs."
44:34;44:36;"- And she has great songs."
44:36;44:37;"- I don't know."
44:37;44:38;"- I've always been a Katy Perry fan."
44:38;44:41;"- She's, that Fireworks song, is that her?"
44:41;44:42;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
44:42;44:44;"- I don't know that one."
44:44;44:46;"- Yeah, I love songs about Katy Perry,"
44:46;44:48;"I love songs by Katy Perry."
44:48;44:49;"- That's cool, man."
44:49;44:50;"- Thank you."
44:50;44:54;"Speaking of cool, it's summer."
44:54;44:56;"It's the first day of summer actually,"
44:56;44:58;"so everybody's gonna be trying to keep cool."
44:58;44:59;"And besides trying to keep cool,"
44:59;45:01;"maybe dipping in the pool,"
45:01;45:02;"having a barbecue with your friends,"
45:02;45:06;"it's gonna be a lot of chatter about the song of the summer."
45:06;45:08;"So let's talk about summer songs."
45:08;45:10;"You know, it's funny, it's almost been a year"
45:10;45:12;"since we first did Time Crisis."
45:12;45:13;"We took a break."
45:13;45:14;"- It's crazy."
45:14;45:16;"- Last summer, we were always listening to the top five,"
45:16;45:18;"so we were always listening to this last year's song"
45:18;45:19;"of the summer."
45:19;45:20;"- Oh God."
45:20;45:23;"- Now I think, I'm pretty sure we crowned this unanimously,"
45:23;45:25;"the song of the summer last year."
45:25;45:28;"And I also wanna point out that people listening at home,"
45:28;45:32;"I find this very painful because one year after a summer"
45:32;45:35;"is literally like the worst time to hear the big songs"
45:35;45:36;"from that summer."
45:36;45:37;"- That's true."
45:37;45:38;"- It really can cause people pain."
45:38;45:40;"So I'm about to play a song that might make you feel"
45:40;45:42;"very weird 'cause you heard it so much about a year ago."
45:42;45:44;"Like in 10 years, you're gonna love it."
45:44;45:49;"In 20 years, your kids are gonna be playing it again maybe,"
45:49;45:51;"but right now it's gonna make you feel,"
45:51;45:53;"you know like sometimes when you're on a swing"
45:53;45:55;"and you get that kind of weird feeling."
45:55;45:56;"- Maybe I took this too far."
45:56;45:57;"- Yeah, yeah."
45:57;45:59;"Here's one of the big songs of last summer."
45:59;46:04;"I remember Despot liked this one."
46:04;46:06;"- Nauseous already."
46:06;46:07;"- It makes me feel good."
46:07;46:13;"Man, I had some fun in summer 2015, man."
46:13;46:14;"What did I do?"
46:14;46:16;"I went to,"
46:16;46:20;"I went to barbecues."

47:42;47:45;"- The sick thing, Ezra, is that we haven't done this show"
47:45;47:48;"in New York for so long that it may have been"
47:48;47:50;"in the top five the last time we did this song here."
47:50;47:53;"So I'm pretty sure the last time we did the show,"
47:53;47:54;"we talked about cheerleader."
47:54;47:56;"And every episode we've talked about cheerleader."
47:56;47:57;"- So Deadspot, I remember you really liked"
47:57;47:59;"that song, ""Cheerleader."""
47:59;48:00;"You still like it?"
48:00;48:01;"- Yeah, I love it."
48:01;48:04;"- Does it bring back any fun summer 2015 memories?"
48:04;48:08;"Perhaps a little summer fling, a little summer romance?"
48:08;48:13;"- My summer of 2015 romance was kind of a bad romance."

49:41;49:42;"I hate this song."
49:44;49:46;"Yeah, honestly, I hate this song too."
49:46;49:50;"- Taylor Swift featuring Kendrick Lamar, ""Bad Blood."""
49:50;49:53;"That was all over the place in the summer of 2015."
49:53;49:54;"Can you guys even remember one important thing"
49:54;49:56;"that happened in summer 2015?"
49:56;49:59;"- Wasn't ""Pizza Rat""?"
49:59;50:00;"""Pizza Rat."" - Summer 2015."
50:00;50:01;"- That's literally, I think,"
50:01;50:04;"the only thing I remember from 2015, period."
50:04;50:06;"- Man, I don't know. - ""Pizza Rat."""

50:07;50:10;"- This is gonna be your president in 30 years, so."
50:10;50:11;"We'll show some respect."
50:11;50:13;"- What were the big movies last summer?"
50:13;50:14;"- Probably an ""Avengers"" movie."
50:14;50:16;"- Probably some ""Avengers"" movie."
50:16;50:18;"- Probably some stupid comedy."
50:18;50:19;"- I don't watch movies."
50:19;50:21;"- Probably some dumb action movie."
50:21;50:22;"You don't watch movies?"
50:22;50:23;"- No, not really."
50:23;50:24;"- What about like ""E.T.""?"
50:24;50:26;"Something like that, would you watch that?"
50:26;50:27;"- I've seen ""E.T."""
50:27;50:29;"- I just proved you wrong, my friend."
50:29;50:31;"- I said, don't really watch movies."
50:31;50:33;"- When's the last time you saw a movie in a theater?"
50:33;50:35;"Did you see ""Captain America Civil War?"""
50:35;50:36;"- No."
50:36;50:38;"Damn, what did I see?"
50:38;50:39;"I went to-- - You see ""Ninja Turtles 2?"""
50:39;50:40;"- No."
50:40;50:42;"What did I see?"
50:42;50:43;"It was like, oh."
50:43;50:49;"Oh, Jonah Hill's new movie, I went to the pre-thing of it."
50:49;50:51;"- Oh yeah, so what's it called?"
50:51;50:53;"It's called ""War Dogs"" now, right?"
50:53;50:53;"- Yeah."
50:53;50:54;"- They changed the title."
50:54;50:55;"You know Jonah's a friend of this show,"
50:55;50:57;"so everybody gotta go see ""War Dogs."""
50:57;50:58;"That's my prediction for movie of the summer."
50:58;51:00;"- Yeah, definitely."
51:00;51:02;"- But now let's get back to song of the summer."
51:02;51:05;"What's it gonna be, the song of the summer in 2016?"
51:05;51:06;"What are the candidates?"
51:06;51:07;"People have been talking about"
51:07;51:08;"this might be song of the summer,"
51:08;51:10;"but you heard about this one?"
51:11;51:14;"- Oh yeah, this is probably it."
51:14;51:15;"- Is it?"
51:15;51:16;"- Yeah."
51:16;51:17;"- It's a good song."
51:17;51:18;"- Yeah, I like this song."

51:49;51:50;"about this song."
51:50;51:53;"- What, the song that I sampled?"
51:53;51:54;"- Yeah."
51:54;51:57;"And that song is from a long time ago."
51:57;51:58;"- Not that long ago."
51:58;51:59;"- It's from a long time ago."
51:59;52:05;"- Well, it's like from the '90s, '90 something, '96,"
52:05;52:07;"is my guess, right?"
52:07;52:10;"- Damn, that is a long time ago, I guess."
52:10;52:10;"- No, it's not that long ago."
52:10;52:12;"- '96, that's 20 years ago."
52:12;52:13;"- Yeah."
52:13;52:14;"- It's not from '96."
52:14;52:16;"So the song that Drake one dance samples"
52:16;52:17;"is called ""Do You Mind?"""
52:17;52:18;"- Yeah."
52:18;52:22;"- It's a pale face, featuring Kyla."
52:22;52:25;"And this song is actually from 2007."
52:25;52:27;"- Oh damn, it's not that long ago at all."
52:27;52:30;"- Remember, things used to be a little faster back in 2007."
52:30;52:34;"So picture this, 2007, George Bush was in the White House."
52:34;52:39;"Everybody was having fun, doing barbecues and going swimming."
52:39;52:42;"That was very popular, summer 2007."
52:42;52:44;"It's kind of similar."
52:44;52:46;"This is, yeah, it's like a little reggaeton."
52:46;52:47;"- It's tropical."
52:47;52:49;"- People call this UK funky."
52:49;52:53;"- But was this ever a hit, this song?"
52:53;52:56;"- This is Tim's beat, I think."
52:56;52:56;"- Yeah."
52:56;52:59;"Okay, now it's starting to sound familiar."
52:59;53:03;"- This song is better."
53:03;53:05;"- You think this song is better than Drake's song?"
53:05;53:07;"- Yeah, definitely."
53:07;53:09;"- You are a professional rapper, Oliver."
53:09;53:14;"I will endorse Alex's opinion on any rap song."

53:31;53:33;"This is a decade ago, man."
53:33;53:35;"- Yeah, but I thought it was like,"
53:35;53:37;"I guess I just have no really--"
53:37;53:38;"- Wait, listen."

53:49;53:51;"We didn't have a lot of time."
53:51;53:53;"- What is that dancer doing?"
53:53;53:54;"- I'm dancing in the studio."
53:54;53:57;"I'm reliving summer 2007."
53:57;54:00;"Man, now I'm thinking back about summer 2007."
54:00;54:04;"Summer 2007 was the first Vampire Weekend nationwide tour."
54:04;54:05;"First time we played LA."
54:05;54:09;"- What was your memory from that tour?"
54:09;54:10;"Being in that van?"
54:10;54:12;"- Yeah, we were in this van."
54:12;54:15;"I remember seeing my family in Texas."
54:15;54:18;"Some of my Texas cousins came out to our show in,"
54:18;54:20;"what's it called?"
54:20;54:22;"It's the town where University of North Texas is."
54:22;54:23;"Denton, Texas."
54:23;54:28;"We played a show for, I think, literally seven people."
54:28;54:29;"But then we got to LA."
54:29;54:31;"The shows in LA were full."
54:31;54:34;"I remember the big news for us then was"
54:34;54:36;"that Fred Armisen came to our first show in LA."
54:36;54:38;"- Was he already on SNL at that point?"
54:38;54:39;"- Yeah, he was on SNL."
54:39;54:40;"It was very exciting for us."
54:40;54:41;"- Cool."
54:41;54:42;"- George Bush was in the White House."
54:42;54:45;"I'm just painting a picture for the younger listeners."
54:45;54:48;"- What was the song of the summer in 2007?"
54:48;54:50;"- It definitely wasn't this."
54:50;54:50;"- No, it wasn't."
54:50;54:53;"- Can you ask Siri that now?"
54:53;54:54;"- Let me look it up."
54:54;54:59;"Song of the summer 2007 was the song that really broke"
54:59;55:02;"one of our most important artists to the next level."
55:02;55:04;"It's called Umbrella by Rihanna."
55:04;55:06;"- Yeah, it was a good one."
55:06;55:08;"- That song was number one in the UK for the whole year,"
55:08;55:11;"and apparently it rained a lot while it was number one."
55:11;55:12;"- There you go."
55:12;55:14;"- So man, picture this."
55:14;55:16;"Summer 2007."
55:16;55:18;"George Bush in the White House."
55:18;55:20;"Umbrella by Rihanna."
55:20;55:24;"Breaking into the public consciousness."
55:24;55:26;"Man, that was crazy."
55:26;55:27;"I was 23 years old."
55:28;55:30;"Why don't we listen to that?"

01:00:20;01:00:23;"Over the years, where have you worked? Levi's, Marc Jacobs."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"Dockers. Dockers?"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Yeah, I love Dockers."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Khakis, double pleated."
01:00:28;01:00:34;"I mentioned Dockers in my single that came out last summer and I felt weird about it."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Are Dockers cool?"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"Nah, I don't really wear Dockers."
01:00:38;01:00:42;"The skinny Dockers would be baggy on Despot."
01:00:42;01:00:42;"Yeah, I can't really wear that."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"If Despot's Diesel now, maybe not."
01:00:44;01:00:46;"I mean, yeah, my legs got bigger."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"So, Mordechai, can we talk about your background? It's interesting."
01:00:49;01:00:52;"Sure, I spent some time at Men's Vogue. Let's not skip Condé Nast."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Oh, I didn't know about that."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"But I'm saying even before that..."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"I studied to become a rabbi."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"Yeah, so even before that, you come from the Hasidic community."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"Yep, yeshiva.com."
01:01:03;01:01:08;"So, that's not a normal transition, is growing up in the Hasidic community"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"and then working at Men's Vogue."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Nope."
01:01:10;01:01:15;"How many people have done that? At tops, 20, 30? Maybe only one."
01:01:15;01:01:15;"It's gotta be."
01:01:15;01:01:18;"So, what kind of clothes did you wear growing up in the Hasidic community?"
01:01:19;01:01:20;"Yamakas, tzitzis."
01:01:20;01:01:23;"What's a tzitzis for the people who don't know?"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"Oh, the fringes, the strings that come out of the side of the man's pants."
01:01:26;01:01:29;"At what age do Hasidic boys start wearing black suits?"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Three."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"As soon as they have the upshirin, they cut the boy's hair."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"That's it, suit."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"So, did you have the peyas?"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"Peyas, yep, yep."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"They tend to grow the peyas into the beard."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"I didn't get into a bunch of different yeshivas"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"because they were like, ""You wax, you trim, you shave."""
01:01:45;01:01:48;"I was like, ""No, I haven't reached proper bar mitzvah puberty."""
01:01:48;01:01:50;"And I don't have the facial hair yet,"
01:01:50;01:01:53;"so the yeshivas wouldn't accept me some of them."
01:01:53;01:01:57;"You know, you start putting on the black hat, fedora, at your bar mitzvah at 13."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"And then at like 17, 18, you start questioning,"
01:02:00;01:02:05;"""Why am I looking like a young rabbi when I don't have any hair in my face?"""
01:02:05;01:02:08;"So, you take the hat off for a second,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"and then you start questioning rabbis, this and that."
01:02:10;01:02:11;"I didn't question anything."
01:02:11;01:02:15;"I just put it down and I wanted to dress like my age."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"Now I'm about ready to put a fedora back on."
01:02:18;01:02:23;"But I skipped part of rabbinical school, went to FIT for a little bit."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"Okay, so that was the big transitional moment."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"Instead of going to rabbinical school, you went to FIT."
01:02:27;01:02:30;"Yeah, became a half a rabbi and a half a fashion designer."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"So when you were going to FIT, were you dressing like a chassid?"
01:02:33;01:02:37;"I had my yarmulke in my pocket, like a pocket square of my blazer probably."
01:02:37;01:02:37;"But..."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Were you wearing all black?"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"No, no, I wore some colors."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"Because I know a lot of people, maybe outside of New York or LA,"
01:02:45;01:02:49;"or the vast majority of the world, are not familiar with chassidic styles."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"People get confused sometimes."
01:02:51;01:02:55;"Because first of all, there's a lot of different types of chassids."
01:02:55;01:02:55;"Oh yeah."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"You have different..."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"And the headwear is very different."
01:02:58;01:03:03;"Because in Williamsburg, is it the satmar who wear the kind of fur donut?"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"Yep."
01:03:04;01:03:10;"But before that, like, young satmar boy wearing like little pillbox velvet hat with a little brim."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"So royal."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Lubavitch, how I grew up, different sect of chassidim."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"You don't wear a hat until you're 13."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"You just wear a yarmulke."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"So we didn't have that."
01:03:18;01:03:19;"But like..."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"So when you get your first hat at your bar mitzvah?"
01:03:21;01:03:22;"12 and 9 months."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"3 months before the bar mitzvah, you start putting on tefillin."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"And you play as if you're a bar mitzvah boy."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"It's all practice."
01:03:28;01:03:32;"You don't make the blessing, but you just put the clothes on and the tefillin."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"But the clothes are amazing."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"And in Lubavitch, you just put on the long double-breasted silk."
01:03:38;01:03:41;"It's almost like a Prince Albert when you're married."
01:03:41;01:03:47;"But in the satmar, in the Williamsburg sects, you start wearing that at 13."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"And you put the fur on only when you're married."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"Interesting."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"Yeah."
01:03:51;01:03:51;"You know what, man?"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"I'm gonna stop you right there."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"Let's listen to some tunes."
01:03:54;01:04:01;"The trees swaying in the summer breeze"
01:04:01;01:04:04;"Showing off their silver leaves"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"As we walk by"
01:04:07;01:04:12;"Soft kisses on a summer's day"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"Laughing all our cares away"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"Just you and I"
01:04:17;01:04:28;"Sweet, sleepy, warm summer nights"
01:04:28;01:04:31;"Gazing at the distant lights"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"In the starry sky"
01:04:33;01:04:42;"They say that all good things must end someday"
01:04:42;01:04:48;"Autumn leaves must fall"
01:04:48;01:04:54;"But don't you know that it hurts me so"
01:04:54;01:04:57;"To say goodbye to you"
01:04:57;01:05:01;"Wish you didn't have to go"
01:05:01;01:05:05;"No, no, no, no"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"When the rain"
01:05:07;01:05:12;"Beats against my windowpane"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"I'll think of summer days again"
01:05:15;01:05:19;"And dream of you"
01:05:26;01:05:34;"They say that all good things must end someday"
01:05:34;01:05:38;"Autumn leaves must fall"
01:05:38;01:05:45;"But don't you know that it hurts me so"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"To say goodbye to you"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"Wish you didn't have to go"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"No, no, no, no"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"When the rain"
01:05:57;01:06:01;"Beats against my windowpane"
01:06:01;01:06:05;"I'll think of summer days again"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"And dream of you"
01:06:08;01:06:12;"And dream of you"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"So I got a question."
01:06:14;01:06:20;"Forgive my ignorance because I'm descended from secular Upper West Side Jews,"
01:06:20;01:06:24;"but sometimes you see the Hasidic guy wearing what almost looks like a kimono."
01:06:24;01:06:29;"I mean, if it's open on a Saturday afternoon, hands in the waistband,"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"you know, kind of just had lunch."
01:06:30;01:06:32;"I could see that."
01:06:32;01:06:32;"But it's silk."
01:06:32;01:06:33;"It's like a silk robe."
01:06:33;01:06:34;"Or like a bathrobe."
01:06:34;01:06:38;"You mean the jacquard, how it's like silk, floral, tonal."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Is that just for like the boss?"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"No, it's really for every married man."
01:06:42;01:06:45;"They put on a tishbek, a special for eating."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"It's almost like a bib."
01:06:47;01:06:50;"I almost think that the florals like camouflage for food stains, but it's not."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"It's really, it's just some royal, royal, royal."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"So I got a question."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"There's other religions that have very specific rules about how to dress."
01:06:58;01:07:02;"Obviously, in the Sikh community, there's very specific look."
01:07:02;01:07:08;"But do you think that growing up in a religious community that valued clothes so much,"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"actually, rather than holding you back, got you interested in fashion?"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"Is there a connection there?"
01:07:11;01:07:12;"Wow."
01:07:12;01:07:16;"Amazing question because people ask me, ""Oh, so what got you into fashion?"""
01:07:16;01:07:16;"I'm like, ""I don't know."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"I have two older sisters."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Girls are supposed to be into fashion."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"They got me into it."""
01:07:20;01:07:20;"Both."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"They ended up wearing my sweaters."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"And you're right."
01:07:23;01:07:27;"It was like wearing a suit at 12 and 13 and 14 and 15 and 16."
01:07:27;01:07:32;"Being in high school and getting your shirt starched for the Sabbath and guys giving you"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"nipple twisters or twisters, whatever they're called, on a freshly starched shirt."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"It's like, ""Oh my God, I spent $250 to get this shirt starched."""
01:07:38;01:07:39;"That's what you do."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"Starch ruins the shirt, long story short, but also makes you look cool in high school."
01:07:43;01:07:44;"But yeah, that's what got me into it."
01:07:44;01:07:47;"And on the Sabbath, when you're wearing your suit, because during the week, you just wear"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"like black backers, you know, black pants, whatever."
01:07:50;01:07:55;"We only wore black and white, but you folded on the nice crease to keep it for Saturday"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"morning to go to synagogue."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"It's almost like being in the military."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"You got to have your uniform looking fresh."
01:07:59;01:08:04;"Because when I was 13, maybe my mom took me to Old Navy or something, but I certainly"
01:08:04;01:08:08;"was not presented with a nice hat."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"You didn't have any sharp creases."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"No, no, no."
01:08:10;01:08:10;"Nobody was."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"Or hats."
01:08:11;01:08:11;"Yeah."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"My school had no uniforms or anything."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"You had barber jackets though."
01:08:15;01:08:15;"We didn't have that."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"My dad had an old barber jacket."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"I got interested in that when I was about 18 years old."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"But again, it wasn't official."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"There wasn't that kind of official style."
01:08:24;01:08:29;"We were talking about this last night or two nights ago on the radio show about how like"
01:08:29;01:08:34;"the Sikhs and then the monks, I guess they folded a certain way, the robe."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"And the Siddic isn't folded a certain way."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"You're actually not allowed to put it on the creases on the Sabbath."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"You're supposed to just fold it over."
01:08:40;01:08:44;"But yeah, it's that pride in the uniform."
01:08:44;01:08:45;"Right."
01:08:45;01:08:45;"Not necessarily."
01:08:45;01:08:50;"The talis, the prayer shawl with the strings, not just the tzitzis with the prayer shawl"
01:08:50;01:08:54;"that every boy wears from three, but the talis with the big, big, big shawl that they wear"
01:08:54;01:08:59;"over the clothes only on the Sabbath and in the mornings, that has to be folded a certain"
01:08:59;01:09:01;"way, which is so weird."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"I actually, since-"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"It's like folding an American flag."
01:09:05;01:09:05;"Exactly."
01:09:05;01:09:08;"It really is like being in the military."
01:09:08;01:09:08;"It really is."
01:09:08;01:09:10;"It's a little looser than that."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"I wouldn't know."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"I haven't been in the military, but yeah, I would imagine it's a little looser."
01:09:14;01:09:15;"You're in school with all boys."
01:09:15;01:09:17;"You got to dress a certain way."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"Uniform."
01:09:19;01:09:24;"So now, you know, it's interesting to me is that as a, how to describe, as a photographer,"
01:09:24;01:09:29;"a social media expert, you also still are very interested in uniforms."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Glad you said expert, not professional."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"I'm not getting paid."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"I'm not getting paid for that."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"I love uniforms, but it's interesting that you say that because-"
01:09:35;01:09:42;"Because Mordecai's, one of his main hashtags that you use on social media is #beautyineverydayuniform."
01:09:42;01:09:46;"And that's one thing that I love about your approach to style is that, you know, we can"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"see high fashion everywhere and I admire high fashion and this is no diss, but there aren't"
01:09:50;01:09:54;"that many people who are looking at kind of the beauty of, say, the way that a New York"
01:09:54;01:09:58;"City employee, like an MTA person maybe embellishes their uniform."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"And that's something that you really have an eye for."
01:10:00;01:10:03;"I think there's uniform, like, you know, UPS, FedEx."
01:10:03;01:10:09;"Sure, FedEx, a girl, guy, you know, delivering during the holidays might put reindeer antlers"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"on their head, but they're still in uniform."
01:10:11;01:10:15;"But I also think there's this Upper East Side guy wearing Chino, seersucker, navy blazer,"
01:10:15;01:10:19;"that's his everyday uniform, acidic, jewel, black and white, not thinking when you wake"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"up in the morning, going with it."
01:10:21;01:10:24;"These Upper East Side dudes that I'm obsessed with, they've been wearing the same J. Press"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"Brooks Brothers bulls*** for the same 30, 40 years, the acidic people, black and white."
01:10:28;01:10:32;"So I consider both uniform and I like finding beauty in the everyday, but it's like you"
01:10:32;01:10:37;"find your door guy or your MTA guy, as soon as he gets off work, he might clip the clip"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"on tight to the edge of the collar."
01:10:40;01:10:40;"Cool."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"He might never put it on."
01:10:41;01:10:47;"I see bus drivers with paper towels, with binder clips around the shirt, not to get"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"ring around the collar."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"That's beautiful."
01:10:49;01:10:54;"He's keeping the shirt nice and crisp and he's taking his uniform and making it his"
01:10:54;01:10:55;"own, which is rare."
01:10:55;01:10:59;"Which is also important in a world where sometimes our choices are limited."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"It's not modified in the army or where in the Orthodox Jewish world, you can't really"
01:11:02;01:11:03;"modify too much."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Now they're making their suits a little more fitted."
01:11:05;01:11:09;"They might put a, you know, a red eyelet in the stitching of the lapel buttonhole,"
01:11:09;01:11:11;"which is not kosher per se."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"It's supposed to be the way it is."
01:11:13;01:11:17;"But you know, when they came over here from Eastern Europe, all over the, you know, Russia"
01:11:17;01:11:22;"or whatever, you know, some wore the casquette and some wore fur and you know, only when"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"they came to America, they switched to a fedora, lababic."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"So they did Americanize a little bit."
01:11:26;01:11:29;"So it does change, but it hasn't been the same style forever."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"It hasn't."
01:11:30;01:11:30;"No."
01:11:30;01:11:32;"Let's put a pin in that, play some music."
01:13:57;01:14:00;"So today's the first day of summer."
01:14:00;01:14:04;"We've been talking about summer music, potential songs of the summer, songs of the summer in"
01:14:04;01:14:04;"your past."
01:14:04;01:14:08;"Let's talk a little bit about men's summer style."
01:14:08;01:14:08;"Oh, yes."
01:14:08;01:14:14;"So first of all, in New York these days, because of global warming or whatever, the weather's"
01:14:14;01:14:15;"all over the place."
01:14:15;01:14:19;"So some of the rules go out the window, but let's kind of keep it to more traditional"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"summer style."
01:14:20;01:14:24;"What are things that you absolutely hate in modern men's summer style these days?"
01:14:24;01:14:29;"So Easter, from what I've learned from going to the parade and watching the men, they can"
01:14:29;01:14:33;"pull out straw, pull out seersucker, pull out pastels because it's Easter."
01:14:33;01:14:33;"Fine."
01:14:33;01:14:34;"Fine."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"But if there's snow on the ground, you're an idiot."
01:14:37;01:14:38;"What are you doing in linens?"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"It's freezing outside."
01:14:40;01:14:41;"Showing your ankles."
01:14:41;01:14:44;"I don't care if you're a rock star on stage or if you're walking to work on Wall Street."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"What are you showing your ankles for?"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"It's freezing."
01:14:46;01:14:48;"That's been happening all winter."
01:14:48;01:14:49;"Now it's summer."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"So you hate when a man shows his ankle in winter?"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"When I'm cold."
01:14:52;01:14:53;"When I'm cold."
01:14:53;01:14:56;"If it's nice out, global warming, swarming, whatever, fine."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"It's the impracticality of it."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"Yeah."
01:14:58;01:15:01;"I'm saying you want to show your ankles, I'm freezing."
01:15:01;01:15:02;"I know."
01:15:02;01:15:06;"When I was in college, I'd never wear socks and I got very sick."
01:15:06;01:15:07;"I learned my lesson."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"I was going to say you have thicker skin than I do."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"No, no, no."
01:15:10;01:15:11;"I'm a very cold person."
01:15:11;01:15:11;"Yeah."
01:15:11;01:15:14;"I love a scarf, silk for this time of the year."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"But so let's say it's a warm out."
01:15:16;01:15:20;"It's summertime and we've got a traditional, an old fashioned warm summer."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"Then the socks are off and that's okay."
01:15:23;01:15:27;"In the big city, I don't wear boat shoes."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"I wear socks."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"I cover my legs."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"There's rules for a reason."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"You never wear shorts?"
01:15:32;01:15:35;"I mean, off air, off the cuff, I do."
01:15:35;01:15:39;"But you spend a lot of time in Italy as anybody who works in men's fashion does."
01:15:39;01:15:40;"I remember once when I was in..."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"What?"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"Is that not true?"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"It's semi true."
01:15:44;01:15:45;"Let me see your passport."
01:15:45;01:15:49;"No, for the business, you go to Pitti Uomo and you look around at the parade of fashion people."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I'm not trying to say that you're a fancy guy."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"I spend time in New York."
01:15:53;01:15:53;"I know."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"I'm not trying to say that you're a fancy guy."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"He's a trader, so he's trying to bait you."
01:15:57;01:16:00;"He ditches New York."
01:16:00;01:16:00;"Yeah."
01:16:00;01:16:03;"Okay, first of all, LA, it all goes out the window with flip-flops all year."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Okay."
01:16:04;01:16:07;"But we're talking New York summertime."
01:16:07;01:16:07;"And can we focus the conversation?"
01:16:07;01:16:08;"What about the boot?"
01:16:08;01:16:09;"The boot toe?"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"You don't have a collar on."
01:16:10;01:16:10;"Gentlemen."
01:16:10;01:16:12;"Neither do I."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"I'm the host of the show."
01:16:14;01:16:14;"Fine."
01:16:14;01:16:15;"I'm glad to say gentlemen."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"You're wearing a jacket."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"He's wearing trousers."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"I remember when I was in high school."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"These are 80s Versace, by the way."
01:16:21;01:16:21;"Kind of like shit."
01:16:21;01:16:23;"They look like chef pants a little."
01:16:23;01:16:23;"No, no, no."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"The houndstooth is much finer."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"Yeah, of course."
01:16:26;01:16:27;"They're nice."
01:16:27;01:16:27;"I like them."
01:16:27;01:16:31;"Actually, these were, again, these 80s Versace pants."
01:16:31;01:16:36;"And a few weeks ago in LA, I had this really nice white linen shirt."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"And it was this is a nice day."
01:16:37;01:16:43;"And I threw on the white linen shirt that had a shawl collar, white linen shirt with"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"these pants and my white shoes."
01:16:44;01:16:45;"And I was feeling really good about myself."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Felt so light and fresh."
01:16:46;01:16:49;"Then I caught a glimpse of myself in a shiny building."
01:16:49;01:16:52;"And I said, all I'm missing is the Crocs."
01:16:52;01:16:55;"I look like I look like a chef who wandered out of the kitchen."
01:16:55;01:17:00;"I mean, if musicians started sizing up, not you musicians are sizing up."
01:17:00;01:17:03;"They'd be doing a real big service for the music industry."
01:17:03;01:17:05;"What do you mean, sizing up their pants?"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Oh, they're too tight."
01:17:07;01:17:07;"Yes."
01:17:07;01:17:08;"Are you?"
01:17:08;01:17:10;"Well, not today."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"I've worn some tight pants."
01:17:12;01:17:13;"Are tight pants not cool anymore?"
01:17:13;01:17:17;"How are you going to strum a guitar, run around on stage, jump dance, crowd surf?"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"What are you?"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"So I've been to Lenny Kravitz."
01:17:20;01:17:21;"Yeah."
01:17:21;01:17:22;"Yeah, be careful."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"What's he doing?"
01:17:23;01:17:24;"His junk popped out."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"His pants split in half."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"That was not a good look."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"He did a little crouch."
01:17:29;01:17:32;"You know, I have opinions on what men should and shouldn't wear."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"Seasonal, where you are, sure."
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Time of the year and everything."
01:17:35;01:17:38;"But I just want men to dress like men."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"So, Mordecai, thank you so much."
01:17:39;01:17:43;"For everybody who's curious about you, who wasn't familiar with you before,"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"what's your social media of choice?"
01:17:45;01:17:49;"If these people want to check out, see you going around New York City, talking about style."
01:17:49;01:17:50;"What do you like?"
01:17:51;01:17:51;"Where should they follow you?"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"I'm loving Snapchat right now."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"It's Mr. Mordecai."
01:17:54;01:17:59;"I lost my password for Mr. Mordecai, but it's M-I-S-T-E-R-M-O-R-D-E-C-H-A-I"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"or Mr. Mordecai on Instagram."
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Mr. Mordecai on Instagram, Mr. Mordecai."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"How's my pronunciation, by the way?"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"I like the C-H."
01:18:06;01:18:06;"That's right."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"No, it's perfect."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Yeah, it's not over like..."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"What does your family say?"
01:18:10;01:18:11;"They say hi, but it's funny."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"They call me Morde, you know."
01:18:13;01:18:13;"Right."
01:18:13;01:18:15;"Okay, so Mr. Mordecai."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"That was that too much."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"Mr. Mordecai on Snapchat."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"Check him out."
01:18:20;01:18:25;"Learn a thing or two about fashion, but remember, at the end of the day, Mr. Morde, you like"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"guys who have fun."
01:18:26;01:18:29;"I especially love men with makeup and dresses."
01:18:29;01:18:30;"Okay."
01:18:30;01:18:31;"Oh, no, that's good to hear."
01:18:31;01:18:32;"All right."
01:18:32;01:18:47;"Because menswear is a shonda right now."
01:18:47;01:18:59;"Okay."
01:18:59;01:19:12;"All right."
01:19:13;01:19:25;"Turn to the right."
01:19:25;01:19:46;"Turn to the left."
01:19:46;01:20:07;"Turn to the right."
01:20:07;01:20:28;"Turn to the left."
01:21:10;01:21:30;"Turn to the right."
01:21:51;01:22:12;"Turn to the left."
01:24:38;01:24:49;"Turn to the left."
01:24:49;01:24:59;"Turn to the left."
01:24:59;01:25:05;"Turn to the left."
01:25:05;01:25:15;"Turn to the left."
01:25:25;01:25:45;"Turn to the left."
01:25:45;01:25:55;"Turn to the left."
