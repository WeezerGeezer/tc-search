00:00;00:04;"Six may be the devil's number, but this is not going to be a devilish episode because"
00:04;00:08;"I'm joined by three people who I consider to be great people."
00:08;00:13;"The Longstreth brothers, Jake, and for the first time, Dave."
00:13;00:15;"As well as my own sister, Emma."
00:15;00:19;"It's a real family affair, and we'll be exploring topics like Thin Lizzy, the Billboard Charts"
00:19;00:24;"of 1985, and 2015's Question King, Justin Bieber."
00:24;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:38;00:45;"[applause]"
01:23;01:38;"[applause]"
01:58;02:08;"[applause]"
09:38;09:40;"[applause]"
09:40;09:44;"That was Dirty Projectors with Because Your Light Is Turning Green."
09:44;09:46;"This is a very exciting show."
09:46;09:49;"This is the first time on Time Crisis we've ever had two sets of siblings."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:52;"The Longstress and the Koenigs."
09:52;09:55;"Jake, a little later on you're going to be teaching us about Thin Lizzy."
09:55;09:56;"Yeah."
09:56;09:57;"Band from the 70s."
09:57;09:59;"A lot of people probably know Boyz R Back in Town."
09:59;10:00;"Yeah."
10:00;10:01;"But there's more to them than that."
10:01;10:02;"Yeah, absolutely."
10:02;10:03;"So we'll be getting to that a little bit later."
10:03;10:05;"Also we're going to try something different for the top five."
10:05;10:08;"Normally we count down the top five songs on iTunes on Time Crisis."
10:08;10:11;"But this time we're actually doing something that approaches a time crisis."
10:11;10:13;"Can't believe it took us this long to think of it."
10:13;10:17;"We're going to be juxtaposing the top five songs on Billboard right now"
10:17;10:21;"with the top five songs on Billboard 30 years ago in 1985."
10:21;10:22;"I'm psyched."
10:22;10:23;"So that's going to be crazy."
10:23;10:26;"But before we get into that, how's everybody been doing this week?"
10:26;10:27;"I've been good."
10:27;10:29;"Yeah, and what's the most exciting thing that happened to you this week?"
10:29;10:31;"I went to Palm Springs."
10:31;10:32;"Why?"
10:32;10:38;"I went for a birthday party and I didn't even end up going."
10:38;10:41;"I only went to the birthday party for like 30 minutes."
10:41;10:42;"Really?"
10:42;10:43;"It was too crazy."
10:43;10:48;"People were jumping on beds, people with their shoes on."
10:48;10:49;"Really?"
10:49;10:51;"And I felt like the people I was with, we couldn't get past that."
10:51;10:53;"Like in an Airbnb?"
10:53;10:54;"At a hotel."
10:54;10:55;"I don't respect that at all."
10:55;11:00;"Okay, and let me tell you why."
11:00;11:02;"I'm very excited."
11:02;11:06;"Okay, first of all, just because it's a hotel and they wash the sheets"
11:06;11:09;"in some weird industrial laundromat, it's still nasty."
11:09;11:13;"I don't know, if somebody's going to put their shoes on a bed, even at a hotel,"
11:13;11:15;"they might put their shoes anywhere."
11:15;11:16;"I think that's disgusting."
11:16;11:18;"And then you feel like you can't trust those people."
11:18;11:19;"Then you can't trust them."
11:19;11:20;"Everybody in here has stayed at a hotel before, right?"
11:20;11:22;"Yeah, it's a super douchey move."
11:22;11:26;"And we all know that when you're staying at a hotel, one of the biggest anxieties"
11:26;11:28;"is what's happened in this room before I got here."
11:28;11:29;"Right."
11:29;11:31;"Because you know what happened at your home or office."
11:31;11:32;"Hopefully."
11:33;11:35;"But at a hotel, you don't know what happened the day before."
11:35;11:37;"You don't know if people were having sex."
11:37;11:38;"Beating off."
11:38;11:41;"Or worst of all, jumping on the bed with their shoes on."
11:41;11:43;"So I got no respect for that."
11:43;11:45;"Your friends are trash."
11:45;11:49;"So there were a lot of concerns with the party, but we also went to the Integratron."
11:49;11:50;"Have you guys ever been there?"
11:50;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:52;"Did you enjoy it?"
11:52;11:54;"Wait, is that the sound place with the bowls?"
11:54;11:56;"Yeah, yeah, the crystal bowls."
11:56;11:58;"It's very California."
11:58;12:02;"It's very California because also the guy who constructed it"
12:02;12:05;"apparently was given the blueprint by aliens."
12:05;12:08;"Well, that's super like desert vibe."
12:08;12:10;"Aliens might exist."
12:10;12:11;"It's true."
12:11;12:13;"I'm willing to believe it."
12:13;12:18;"Today on the music front, I was putting together a few songs, some ideas for the playlist today."
12:18;12:22;"I feel like Time Crisis is getting a reputation for playing a lot of old music from the 50s,"
12:22;12:24;"60s, and 70s."
12:24;12:28;"So I thought maybe today I'd make more of an effort to play some newer music, stuff"
12:28;12:30;"from the 90s."
12:30;12:33;"So I was thinking about some of my favorite 90s songs, and I put together a little rock"
12:33;12:34;"block."
12:34;12:36;"For some reason, all these songs go together."
12:36;12:39;"They're kind of like the rootsy side of the 90s."
12:39;12:44;"Some people would say Nirvana is what makes them feel like the ultimate early 90s music"
12:44;12:46;"or maybe like hip hop."
12:46;12:50;"But for me, this song just makes me feel like the early 90s so hard."
12:50;12:51;"I'm psyched to hear what it is."
12:51;12:52;"Me too."
12:52;12:56;"All right, let's see who can guess it first from the opening bars."
12:56;12:59;"Oh, Aerosmith?"
12:59;13:00;"Yeah, Aerosmith."
13:00;13:01;"Strong."
13:01;13:02;"Love this song."
13:03;13:04;"Do you?"
13:04;13:05;"Yeah."
13:06;13:15;"There was a time when I was so brokenhearted."
13:15;13:20;"Love wasn't much of a friend of mine."
13:20;13:29;"The tables have turned, yeah, and caused me in them ways I parted."
13:29;13:34;"That kind of love was the killing kind."
13:35;13:42;"Listen, all I want is someone I can't resist."
13:42;13:48;"I know all I need to know right away is I got you."
13:48;13:56;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
13:56;14:02;"Love is sweet misery."
14:02;14:10;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm down 'cause I let you."
14:10;14:15;"Do what you do down on me."
14:15;14:23;"Now he's not in a waiting room, they're talking 'bout you and me."
14:23;14:26;"You, you cry when I make it loud."
14:26;14:30;"Must be what you were saying."
14:30;14:33;"It's down on me."
14:33;14:37;"Yeah, I got to tell you one thing."
14:37;14:39;"It's been on my mind."
14:39;14:42;"Girl, I gotta say."
14:42;14:47;"We're partners in crime."
14:47;14:51;"You got that certain something."
14:51;14:56;"What you give to me takes my breath away."
14:56;15:04;"All I know is true is the devil's in your kiss."
15:04;15:08;"If I let go, I'll be frozen to fire."
15:08;15:10;"I can't resist."
15:10;15:18;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
15:18;15:23;"Love is sweet misery."
15:23;15:31;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm down 'cause I let you."
15:31;15:37;"Do what you do down on me."
15:38;15:41;"[guitar solo]"
15:41;15:58;"What you do is sad and why you let it stay."
15:58;16:01;"Yeah, I know, too late, I know."
16:01;16:05;"Do you give your heart away?"
16:05;16:08;"Yeah, I know."
16:08;16:16;"I was crying when I met you, but now I'm trying to forget you."
16:16;16:21;"Your love is sweet misery."
16:21;16:30;"I was trying just to get you, now I'm dying to let you."
16:30;16:38;"Do what you do, what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do."
16:38;16:41;"[guitar solo]"
17:09;17:17;"I was trying to meet you But I'm trying to forget you"
17:17;17:26;"Now I'm missing what is yours I was trying to meet you"
17:26;17:32;"But I'm doing it 'cause I met you Do what you do"
17:32;17:35;"I've got to, I've got to"
17:35;17:47;"I was trying to meet you But I'm trying to forget you"
17:47;17:51;"Now I'm missing what is yours"
17:51;18:10;"[Instrumental]"
18:10;18:15;"It looks like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone"
18:15;18:19;"Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn and you're back to the way"
18:19;18:24;"There's a world outside the darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore"
18:24;18:29;"With a brave heart, free love and soul Come ride with me to the distant shore"
18:29;18:34;"We won't hesitate Break down the guarded gate"
18:34;18:38;"There's not much time left today"
18:38;18:47;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
18:47;18:54;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
18:54;19:01;"Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around"
19:01;19:06;"I loved you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hands"
19:06;19:11;"From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Kabyl Pass to Vancouver's lights"
19:11;19:16;"Knock me down, I'm back up again You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man"
19:16;19:20;"With no load I can't hold Roads are rough, this I know"
19:20;19:25;"I'll be there when the light comes in Just tell 'em we're survivors"
19:25;19:34;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
19:34;19:44;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
19:44;19:53;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
19:53;20:03;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
20:03;20:13;"There was a distance between you and I"
20:13;20:23;"Misunderstanding once but now we're looking in the eye"
20:23;20:42;"[instrumental]"
20:42;20:46;"There ain't no load that I can't hold Roads are rough, this I know"
20:46;20:53;"I'll be there when the light comes in Just tell 'em we're survivors"
20:53;21:02;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
21:02;21:10;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
21:10;21:12;"Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah"
21:12;21:21;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
21:21;21:29;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
21:29;21:31;"Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah"
21:31;21:39;"Life is a highway I won't ride it all night long"
21:39;21:47;"Get your door in my way I won't drive it all night long"
21:47;22:01;"[instrumental]"
22:01;22:05;"That was Tom Cochran with ""Life is a Highway"" off his album ""Mad Mad World."""
22:05;22:11;"What's that full length like? Not familiar with any of the deeper cuts?"
22:11;22:16;"There's something about that Aerosmith crying ""and life is a highway"""
22:16;22:21;"You know, 'cause it's so '90s but it's also like, it was kind of backwards looking, like rootsy."
22:21;22:27;"Yeah, it was like the mainstream hits that were super out of step with what the cool thing that was happening in the mainstream was."
22:27;22:31;"Yeah, I mean Nirvana, why do I keep calling Aerosmith Nirvana?"
22:31;22:34;"That's the best mix-up ever."
22:34;22:40;"I feel like Aerosmith, was Aerosmith cool? You know, wait, does Beavis or Butthead wear an Aerosmith t-shirt?"
22:40;22:43;"No, Metallica and AC/DC."
22:43;22:46;"Does Wayne or Garth wear an Aerosmith t-shirt?"
22:46;22:55;"Wayne and Garth to our listeners who are under 25 are characters from the Wayne's World film franchise and SNL sketch."
22:55;23:02;"Okay, yeah, we just got word from our producers that somebody in Wayne's World wore an Aerosmith t-shirt."
23:02;23:05;"Yeah, 'cause Aerosmith was popping off in the '90s. Oh, it was Garth."
23:05;23:09;"Em and I were talking about earlier that Liv Tyler is our cousin."
23:09;23:10;"Just barely."
23:10;23:13;"Just barely, not even. You know, I met Liv Tyler once."
23:13;23:14;"Oh, did you?"
23:14;23:18;"And I walked right up to her and said, ""Hey, cuz, you're my cousin."""
23:18;23:25;"Nah, we like knew somebody in common and so we started talking and I said, ""This might sound weird, but supposedly we're cousins."""
23:25;23:31;"Basically, Liv Tyler's mom married a guy who is our cousin that we never met."
23:31;23:32;"Oh my God."
23:32;23:34;"That's about as deep as it goes."
23:34;23:36;"This episode's all about family. If you can't tell."
23:36;23:38;"That's a strong connection."
23:38;23:46;"I want to continue with the new music because, like I said, Time Crisis is not just about music from the '50s, '60s, and '70s."
23:46;23:50;"So I was trying to think of more recent hits, stuff more from the past 25, 30 years."
23:50;23:55;"And one song that came to mind is a song from the 2000s that I loved."
23:55;24:00;"And I realized I've been talking about this with some of the younger people at the office."
24:00;24:04;"And they don't really remember this song, but in some ways this song paved the way for a lot of what's going on today."
24:04;24:08;"This is a young guy named Eamon. E-A-M-O-N."
24:08;24:11;"I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, but he's a young man from Staten Island."
24:11;24:17;"And he made this song that was kind of a little bit like doo-wop, but had a lot of foul language."
24:17;24:21;"And it's basically a breakup song called ""F*ck It, I Don't Want You Back."""
24:21;24:23;"Oh, I remember this."
24:23;24:26;"This was a big song about 10, 12 years ago."
24:26;24:29;"But I feel like it's a--I don't know, people aren't really respecting it for its influence."
24:29;24:30;"Do you remember this one, Jake?"
24:30;24:31;"I might when you start playing it."
24:31;24:32;"All right, check it out."
24:33;24:40;"Whoa, ooh"
24:40;24:44;"No, no, no"
24:44;24:56;"See, I don't know why I liked you so much"
24:56;25:01;"I gave you all of my trust"
25:01;25:06;"I told you I loved you"
25:06;25:08;"Now that's all down the drain"
25:08;25:10;"You put me through a pain"
25:10;25:15;"I wanna let you know my fear"
25:15;25:18;"But I said it don't mean sh*t now"
25:18;25:22;"The presents might as well go now"
25:22;25:25;"All those kisses, they didn't mean jack"
25:25;25:29;"You, you, I don't want you back"
25:29;25:32;"But I said it don't mean sh*t now"
25:32;25:36;"The presents might as well go now"
25:36;25:39;"All those kisses, they didn't mean jack"
25:39;25:43;"You, you, I don't want you back"
25:43;25:52;"You thought you could keep this sh*t from me, yeah"
25:52;25:57;"You burned me, I heard the story"
25:57;26:03;"You played me, you even gave a m*rder"
26:03;26:05;"Now you're asking for me back"
26:05;26:07;"You're just another hack"
26:07;26:11;"Look out, sweat, 'cause you're done with me"
26:11;26:15;"But I said it don't mean sh*t now"
26:15;26:18;"The presents might as well go now"
26:18;26:22;"All those kisses, they didn't mean jack"
26:22;26:25;"You, you, I don't want you back"
26:25;26:28;"But I said it don't mean sh*t now"
26:28;26:32;"The presents might as well go now"
26:32;26:35;"All those kisses, they didn't mean jack"
26:35;26:38;"You, you, I don't want you back"
26:38;26:53;"Oh, oh, ah-ha, yeah"
26:53;26:59;"You questioned, did I care?"
26:59;27:03;"You could ask anyone"
27:03;27:07;"I even said you were my great one"
27:07;27:13;"Now it's over"
27:13;27:16;"But I do admit I'm sad, it hurts real bad"
27:16;27:21;"I can't sweat that 'cause I love the heart"
27:21;27:24;"But I said it don't mean sh*t now"
27:24;27:28;"The presents might as well go now"
27:28;27:31;"All those kisses, they didn't mean jack"
27:31;27:34;"You, you, I don't want you back"
27:34;27:59;"Oh, oh, ah-ha, yeah"
27:59;28:01;"That was Emon with ""F*ck It"""
28:01;28:03;"I don't know how I feel about it anymore, but whatever"
28:03;28:04;"But poignant"
28:04;28:06;"Poignant, people should know that it existed"
28:06;28:09;"We just, for the first time, opened up the mail bag"
28:09;28:11;"Here on Time Crisis"
28:11;28:12;"Do you have a favorite type of pasta?"
28:12;28:14;"For me, it's squid ink fettuccine"
28:14;28:16;"What's your opinion on Bernie Sanders?"
28:16;28:18;"Do you think he can win the Democratic bid?"
28:18;28:19;"Yes"
28:19;28:20;"People are excited about him"
28:20;28:21;"You think he can?"
28:21;28:23;"Yeah, yeah"
28:23;28:25;"I didn't think he could a few weeks ago, but"
28:25;28:27;"I don't know, there's a lot of momentum"
28:27;28:29;"How about you?"
28:29;28:31;"He seems like the best of the worst"
28:31;28:35;"Politicians are all trash, man"
28:35;28:37;"That's a hopeful message for the youth"
28:37;28:38;"This question is too political"
28:38;28:40;"Do you wear socks and sandals?"
28:40;28:41;"No, of course not"
28:41;28:43;"I don't wear sandals"
28:43;28:46;"I don't wear socks"
28:46;28:48;"Do you have a strict no sandals policy?"
28:48;28:49;"Yeah"
28:49;28:50;"Really?"
28:50;28:51;"Yeah"
28:51;28:52;"You wouldn't do Birkenstocks?"
28:52;28:53;"No"
28:53;28:56;"Okay, maybe we'll dig back into the questions bag"
28:56;28:57;"A little bit later"
28:57;29:01;"Thank you so much to everybody on Twitter for reaching out"
29:01;29:12;"Okay Jake, it's time to talk about"
29:12;29:14;"Thin Lizzy"
29:14;29:19;"Okay Jake, Thin Lizzy is a band from?"
29:19;29:20;"Dublin, Ireland"
29:21;29:24;"They're probably best known in the States for"
29:24;29:25;"The Boys Are Back in Town"
29:26;29:27;"You know that song, Emma?"
29:27;29:28;"Yes, I know that one"
29:28;29:29;"And you're not a big classic rock person"
29:29;29:30;"No"
29:30;29:31;"But you know the song The Boys Are Back in Town"
29:31;29:32;"Of course"
29:32;29:35;"But you would, so some people might even think of them as a one hit wonder"
29:35;29:37;"But you would say that's far from true"
29:37;29:40;"Yeah, that's off Jailbreak from 1976"
29:40;29:42;"Which I think is their sixth album"
29:42;29:43;"Whoa, really?"
29:43;29:46;"Yeah, yeah, so they were started, they formed in 1969 in Dublin"
29:46;29:48;"And put out their first record in '71"
29:48;29:51;"Yeah, I mean I think Thin Lizzy, I think the way"
29:51;29:54;"Kind of classic rock radio formatting has gone"
29:54;29:57;"They get kind of lumped in with pretty bad bands from that era"
29:57;30:00;"Bachman Turner Overdrive, Bad Company"
30:00;30:03;"You know, those kind of bands, AC/DC even"
30:03;30:05;"Wait, but you don't think AC/DC are bad"
30:05;30:08;"It's okay, I guess that's a whole other can of worms"
30:08;30:10;"I'll talk about that in two weeks"
30:10;30:13;"Okay, I would say AC/DC is in a different level than Bachman Turner Overdrive"
30:13;30:16;"Well you know, one interesting thing to me about Thin Lizzy and AC/DC as well"
30:16;30:21;"These are the rock bands that almost had a touch of punk in them"
30:21;30:24;"Bachman Turner Overdrive has zero percent punk"
30:24;30:27;"AC/DC, even though they're just kind of rock dudes"
30:27;30:30;"There's something about their attitude and even the production"
30:30;30:31;"That I think"
30:31;30:32;"And the simplicity"
30:32;30:36;"Yeah, they got written about in early issues of Punk Magazine"
30:36;30:37;"Interesting, I could see that"
30:37;30:40;"Which was this magazine in New York that was one of the first punk magazines"
30:40;30:44;"And even Thin Lizzy, there was something almost proto-New Wave about the sound"
30:44;30:47;"Yeah, I mean it was really like, sparse"
30:47;30:50;"Yeah, maybe it's the cymbals that are sparse"
30:50;30:53;"The singing was really idiosyncratic and unique to Phil Lynott"
30:53;30:55;"Right, well so let's just kick things off"
30:55;30:57;"Just for people who haven't heard him before"
30:57;30:59;"Let's listen a little bit of The Boys Are Back In Town"
30:59;31:01;"Just to remind people who Thin Lizzy is"
31:01;31:05;"Yeah, and this song might include my favorite lyrical rock couplet ever"
31:05;31:06;"Yeah, what's that?"
31:06;31:07;"Which is"
31:07;31:10;"Friday night they'll be dressed to kill down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
31:10;31:13;"Friday night they're dressed to kill"
31:13;31:16;"Down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
31:16;31:17;"It's an amazing line"
31:17;31:22;"It's so good, it's so funny but also evocative of the whole song"
31:22;31:23;"The 70s"
31:23;31:26;"The whole song is sort of this nostalgic look at"
31:26;31:30;"The guy is coming back into town and everyone's meeting at the bar on a Friday night"
31:30;31:34;"And it's a summer and the jukebox is blasting out my favorite song"
31:34;31:36;"At the bar and grill"
31:36;31:37;"Yeah"
31:37;31:38;"Here's Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back In Town"
31:38;32:02;"guitar solo"
32:02;32:05;"Guess who just got back today"
32:05;32:08;"Them wild-eyed boys that had been away"
32:08;32:11;"Haven't changed, had much to say"
32:11;32:14;"But man, I still think them cats are crazy"
32:14;32:17;"They were asking if you were around"
32:17;32:20;"How you was, where you could be found"
32:20;32:23;"Told them you were living downtown"
32:23;32:26;"Driving all the old men crazy"
32:26;32:28;"The Boys Are Back In Town"
32:28;32:31;"guitar solo"
32:31;32:35;"I said the boys are back in town"
32:35;32:37;"guitar solo"
32:37;32:40;"The boys are back in town"
32:43;32:56;"guitar solo"
32:56;32:59;"You know that chick that used to dance a lot"
32:59;33:02;"Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got"
33:02;33:05;"Man, when I tell you she was cool and she was red hot"
33:05;33:08;"I mean she was steaming"
33:08;33:11;"And that time over at Johnny's Place"
33:11;33:14;"Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face"
33:14;33:17;"Man, we just fell about the place"
33:17;33:19;"If that chick don't want to know, forget her"
33:19;33:25;"The boys are back in town"
33:25;33:29;"I said the boys are back in town"
33:29;33:31;"guitar solo"
33:31;33:34;"The boys are back in town"
33:37;33:53;"guitar solo"
33:53;33:56;"Spread the word around"
33:56;33:59;"Yes, who's back in town"
33:59;34:03;"guitar solo"
34:03;34:06;"You spread the word around"
34:06;34:13;"guitar solo"
34:13;34:16;"Friday night they'll be dressed to kill"
34:16;34:19;"Down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
34:19;34:22;"The drink will flow and blood will spill"
34:22;34:25;"And if the boys want to fight you better let 'em"
34:25;34:29;"That new box in the corner blasting out my favorite song"
34:29;34:32;"The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long"
34:32;34:34;"Won't be long 'til summer comes"
34:34;34:37;"Now that the boys are here again"
34:37;34:43;"The boys are back in town"
34:49;34:53;"The boys are back in town"
34:53;34:55;"Spread the word around"
34:55;34:58;"The boys are back in town"
34:58;35:00;"The boys are back"
35:00;35:29;"guitar solo"
35:29;35:39;"The boys are back in town again"
35:39;35:43;"They're hanging down at Dino's"
35:43;35:55;"The boys are back in town again"
35:55;35:58;"That was Tim Lizzy with The Boys Are Back in Town."
35:58;36:01;"So we were just talking before about the line about a bar and grill."
36:01;36:05;"I'm very interested in this concept of the bar and grill."
36:05;36:07;"What does it connote?"
36:07;36:10;"Because everybody knows what a bar is."
36:10;36:11;"Everybody knows what a grill is."
36:11;36:15;"But a bar and grill, it's like a grown up restaurant."
36:15;36:17;"Is there a just a grill restaurant?"
36:17;36:19;"Like it's like, welcome to so and so's grill."
36:19;36:21;"But if you're grilling, you're probably drinking."
36:21;36:22;"You're probably also a bar."
36:22;36:24;"But there's something about bar and grill."
36:24;36:26;"You know that TGI Fridays originally was like"
36:26;36:30;"just like this kind of like bar, I think in Times Square."
36:30;36:31;"I did know this."
36:31;36:32;"That people would go to."
36:32;36:35;"I feel like that's like it was almost like a swingers bar or something."
36:35;36:39;"I think it was like a hip New York City club for a few years."
36:39;36:40;"Maybe it was a bar and grill."
36:40;36:44;"So a bar and grill is a place where you can go up post up at the bar"
36:44;36:47;"and have a drink or you can be seated and there's table service."
36:47;36:50;"Yeah, I mean it's like an Applebee's or a Chili's."
36:50;36:54;"That's like the shitty modern corporate version of like the 70s bar and grill."
36:54;36:58;"I'll have you know Applebee's and Chili's both started in the mid 70s."
36:58;36:59;"Oh God."
36:59;37:00;"In Texas."
37:00;37:03;"So I think, so I think, and so I think, you know,"
37:03;37:07;"if we're wondering about Phil Lynott singing about Dino's Bar and Grill,"
37:07;37:08;"there's a couple options."
37:08;37:12;"One, there is a place in Dublin, Ireland called Dino's Bar and Grill that exists."
37:12;37:13;"Seems unlikely."
37:13;37:16;"Or, yeah, and like some sort of Americanization is already happening."
37:16;37:18;"In Dublin they have pubs."
37:18;37:19;"Right."
37:19;37:22;"That's the original bar and grill is a pub because you can usually get food at a pub."
37:22;37:23;"Absolutely."
37:23;37:28;"But he has like some fantasy of America and he's projecting that like Dino's Bar and Grill"
37:28;37:29;"is some place in like San Diego."
37:29;37:30;"Right."
37:30;37:32;"And even Dino sounds like more like an American guy."
37:32;37:33;"Yeah, like North Jersey."
37:33;37:34;"Yeah."
37:35;37:36;"You remember Mr. Dino's."
37:36;37:39;"Oh yeah, that was the local pizza place by where we grew up with Mr. Dino's."
37:39;37:43;"But something about Friday night they'll be dressed to kill down at Dino's Bar and Grill"
37:43;37:45;"has always been super evocative to me."
37:45;37:46;"Right."
37:46;37:51;"It's so specific and it's so funny, but also it's sung with such like emotion and heart."
37:51;37:53;"Yeah, there's no joke in there."
37:53;37:56;"No, there's zero joke, which is another thing about Thin Lizzy."
37:56;38:00;"Like a lot of their songs, especially like the later material, there is a lot of humor"
38:00;38:05;"in it and I don't know the extent to which it was deliberately kind of funny."
38:05;38:07;"You know that song Cowboy Song?"
38:07;38:08;"Yeah, maybe we should get into that one."
38:08;38:11;"That's probably one of their best known songs after the boys are back in town."
38:11;38:14;"Same record, Jailbreak from '76."
38:14;38:20;"Opening lyrics of Cowboy Song are ""I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the plane."""
38:20;38:22;"No, no, sorry, I f*cked it up."
38:22;38:23;"Wait, wait, wait."
38:23;38:25;"""I am just a cowboy."""
38:25;38:26;"Lonely on the trail."
38:26;38:27;"Lonesome on the trail?"
38:27;38:28;"Yeah, lonesome on the trail."
38:28;38:30;"""Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female."""
38:30;38:35;"Which also, we were talking about this earlier, the concept of calling a woman a female seemed"
38:35;38:37;"so '70s too."
38:37;38:39;"And hilarious."
38:39;38:40;"A female."
38:40;38:42;"Do you think he meant it as a joke?"
38:42;38:43;"No."
38:43;38:44;"Like it's a bad rhyme."
38:44;38:45;"""Lonesome on the trail."
38:45;38:47;"Lord, I'm just thinking about a certain female."""
38:47;38:48;"I mean..."
38:48;38:49;"It's almost like Proto R. Kelly."
38:49;38:50;"Yeah, in a way."
38:50;38:55;"What do you think, Emma, you're the only woman on the panel today, what do you think it implies"
38:55;38:58;"to call somebody a female versus a woman?"
38:58;38:59;"What does it connote?"
38:59;39:01;"It's hard to say."
39:01;39:03;"I mean, I think it's better than..."
39:03;39:07;"I think a lot of people have a problem with calling women girls, adult women girls."
39:07;39:12;"But there's no real casual equivalent for guy or a woman, you know?"
39:12;39:15;"There's guys and men and then there's girls and..."
39:15;39:17;"Well, it's dolls, guys and dolls."
39:17;39:19;"Right."
39:19;39:22;"But yeah, I think a female, I don't know if I've ever heard that used."
39:22;39:23;"""A certain female."""
39:23;39:25;"It does sound kind of R&B."
39:25;39:28;"I can't think of another use of the word female in a song."
39:28;39:30;"Usually it's like, ""Babe."""
39:30;39:31;"You know, that kind of stuff."
39:31;39:35;"So it's my instinct to say it's sincere and it's not offensive."
39:35;39:39;"It's a forced bad rhyme, but again, it's sung with such feeling."
39:39;39:42;"Well, it also just seems very uncowboyish to say female."
39:42;39:43;"But whatever."
39:43;39:45;"I mean, it's an anachronism."
39:45;39:49;"This is basically him digging into every trope of American cowboy songs"
39:49;39:51;"and just jamming them all into one song."
39:51;39:52;"And maybe getting it a little wrong."
39:52;39:53;"Yeah."
39:53;39:56;"All right, so here's Thin Lizzy with ""Cowboy Son."""
39:56;40:00;"I am just a cowboy"
40:00;40:06;"Lonesome on the trail"
40:06;40:08;"A starry night"
40:08;40:11;"A campfire light"
40:11;40:18;"The coyote call"
40:18;40:24;"And the howling winds wail"
40:24;40:29;"So I'll ride out"
40:29;40:33;"To the old sundown"
40:54;40:57;"I am just a cowboy"
40:57;41:01;"Lonesome on the trail"
41:01;41:07;"Lord, I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female"
41:07;41:11;"The nights we spent together"
41:11;41:15;"Riding on the road"
41:15;41:18;"Looking back"
41:18;41:22;"It didn't seem so strange"
41:22;41:26;"Roll me over and turn me around"
41:26;41:30;"Left me keep standing 'til I hit the ground"
41:30;41:34;"Roll me over and let me go"
41:34;41:37;"Right near the rodeo"
41:37;41:41;"I was took in Texas"
41:41;41:45;"I did not know her name"
41:45;41:48;"Lord, all these southern girls"
41:48;41:52;"They seem the same"
41:52;41:55;"Down below the water"
41:55;41:59;"In a town in Mexico"
41:59;42:01;"I got my job"
42:01;42:06;"Busting broncs for the rodeo"
42:06;42:09;"Roll me over and turn me around"
42:09;42:13;"Left me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground"
42:13;42:17;"Roll me over and let me go"
42:17;42:20;"Running free with a buffalo"
43:04;43:09;"Roll me over"
43:09;43:18;"And I'll turn around"
43:18;43:23;"And I'll move my fingers"
43:23;43:27;"Up and down"
43:47;43:51;"It's okay amigo"
43:51;43:58;"Just let me go"
43:58;44:01;"Right near the rodeo"
44:43;44:46;"Roll me over and turn me around"
44:46;44:50;"Left me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground"
44:50;44:53;"Roll me over and let me go"
44:53;44:57;"Right near the rodeo"
44:57;45:00;"Roll me over and set me free"
45:00;45:04;"Cowboy's life is the life for me"
45:09;45:11;"Thin Lizzy with the Cowboy Song."
45:11;45:14;"Interesting."
45:14;45:17;"Both those songs are off the Jailbreak album from '76,"
45:17;45:19;"which was their big commercial breakthrough."
45:19;45:23;"They had been grinding it out for a good 7 years prior to that,"
45:23;45:26;"putting out a lot of records, a lot of lineup changes in the band."
45:26;45:29;"A lot of the records went nowhere, kind of touring a lot."
45:29;45:32;"They kind of had their sound developed from the get-go,"
45:32;45:36;"and it took a while for their sound to sync up with sort of what was going to be popular at the time."
45:36;45:39;"We could listen to the first song off their first record."
45:39;45:41;"Yeah, let's put it in contrast. Let's go back to the very start."
45:41;45:45;"What's that? The friendly ranger at Klontarf Castle?"
45:45;45:46;"Exactly."
45:46;45:48;"Sounds like a Wes Anderson movie."
45:48;45:50;"He's probably a Thin Lizzy fan."
45:50;45:54;"I mean, one interesting thing about Thin Lizzy is that now we kind of take it for granted"
45:54;45:57;"that because U2 became one of the biggest bands in the world,"
45:57;46:02;"I think we take it for granted that musicians from Ireland can take over."
46:02;46:07;"U2, Riverdance, The Coors."
46:07;46:09;"Okay, I'm not counting Van Morrison."
46:09;46:11;"Elvis Costello? Wait, okay."
46:11;46:14;"Elvis Costello, I believe, is of Irish descent."
46:14;46:16;"Oh, he came up through London. I got you."
46:16;46:18;"Yeah, I mean, I think he was born and raised in the UK."
46:18;46:22;"But for Thin Lizzy at the time, Ireland, first of all, is a very small country."
46:22;46:24;"You know the population of Ireland is?"
46:24;46:25;"No."
46:25;46:26;"It's like four million."
46:26;46:27;"Really? Wow."
46:27;46:30;"Yeah, so about the same size as LA."
46:30;46:34;"And I think at the time, being a band from Ireland was probably not that different"
46:34;46:37;"than being a band from Denmark or something."
46:37;46:40;"You know, an incredibly rich musical history, but just in terms of on the world stage."
46:40;46:43;"Sure, sure. Outside of it, for sure."
46:43;46:45;"And as a band, I mean, they were unique."
46:45;46:50;"I mean, Phil Lynott, who was the lead singer and bass player and songwriter,"
46:50;46:54;"was a black Irishman, which was a really interesting visual component of the band."
46:54;46:57;"Because it was like two other guys with this long blonde hair,"
46:57;47:00;"and then the black Irishman playing bass up front with the huge afro."
47:00;47:04;"And also, he was like proudly Irish. There's like a lot of Irish mythology and stuff."
47:04;47:08;"Yeah, in the early records, they really, like Whiskey in the Jar, that kind of stuff,"
47:08;47:13;"they are taking the sort of ancient Celtic songs and then making them into these rock songs."
47:13;47:17;"And it's funny too, because it's like there is a lot of local Irish energy in their music,"
47:17;47:21;"but it's also this like weirdly international language of rock and roll."
47:21;47:25;"I guess in this first song that we're going to hear, the first song on their first record,"
47:25;47:31;"The Friendly Ranger at Clontarf Castle, it opens with a spoken word piece"
47:31;47:34;"that has this kind of like psychedelic Hendrix vibe."
47:34;47:36;"And you can kind of hear his Irish accent."
47:36;47:37;"Yeah."
47:37;47:40;"And then they kind of kick in, the band drops in, and he starts singing."
47:40;47:43;"And it turns into this like very distinctive vocal singing mode."
47:43;47:48;"Like I said, it stops sounding Irish. It just turns into his like rock voice."
47:48;47:49;"Right."
47:49;47:52;"Which he had developed like from the get-go."
47:52;47:54;"Right. Well, yeah, I'm excited to hear this."
47:54;47:56;"And then it goes out with harmonized guitars."
47:56;47:59;"The drums are super nimble and light. It's really sparse."
47:59;48:02;"The bass playing is like driving the whole song. It's so good."
48:02;48:03;"Anyway, let's get in."
48:10;48:13;"The friendly ranger paused"
48:13;48:16;"And scoobing a bowl of beans spreading them like stars"
48:16;48:20;"Falling like justice on different scenes"
48:20;48:23;"I'm damned, indeed comrade, I'm being bombed"
48:23;48:29;"And all the people's faces turn strawberry blonde"
48:29;48:32;"By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits"
48:32;48:35;"For the sun making sure it's not late"
48:35;48:39;"Just in time, no need to fear, well just in case"
48:39;48:44;"And all the people are happy for another year"
48:44;48:49;"And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun"
48:49;48:52;"Getting its glow"
48:52;48:54;"He goes on"
48:54;48:56;"Singing the song"
48:57;48:59;"bass solo"
48:59;49:13;"To feel the goodness glowing inside"
49:13;49:17;"To walk down the street with my arms about your hips"
49:17;49:20;"Side by side"
49:20;49:25;"To play with a sad-eyed child till he smiles"
49:25;49:28;"To look at a starry sky at night"
49:28;49:32;"Realize the miles"
49:32;49:37;"To see the sunset behind the steeple"
49:37;49:44;"Plum-tarf castle, no king, queen or nightly people"
49:44;49:48;"A coal fire and its pouring rain"
49:48;49:52;"To wave goodbye to a very good friend"
49:52;49:55;"Never meet again"
49:55;50:01;"Little thoughts bring"
50:01;50:04;"Little memories"

50:32;50:35;"bass solo"
50:35;50:38;"guitar solo"
51:03;51:08;"Then Lizzie with the friendly ranger at Clontarf Castle."
51:08;51:10;"So Jay, we had some discussion in the studio before."
51:10;51:13;"Now, you were describing Phil Lynott."
51:13;51:15;"Lynott. I think that's how you say it."
51:15;51:20;"Phil Lynott as being black Irish because he was a person of partial African descent"
51:20;51:22;"but also Irish nationality."
51:22;51:23;"Right."
51:23;51:28;"But our producer in the studio is pointing out that there's another meaning for the phrase ""black Irish""."
51:28;51:29;"Which was?"
51:29;51:34;"Which I think just means when you're Irish and you have kind of like darker skin and darker hair."
51:34;51:37;"As opposed to being fair and having red hair?"
51:37;51:43;"As opposed to being, yeah, like super white with freckles and red hair, which is one classic Irish look."
51:43;51:50;"The way it's been explained to me is that Colin Farrell is a classic example of being, of what it means to be black Irish."
51:50;51:53;"I guess the term would be ""African Irish""."
51:53;51:54;"Yeah."
51:54;51:56;"For Phil Lynott."
51:56;52:00;"I think his father might have been African American and his mother was Irish."
52:00;52:02;"So yeah, he's African Irish."
52:02;52:03;"Are you Irish at all?"
52:03;52:05;"Maybe mildly."
52:05;52:08;"Mildly Irish."
52:08;52:11;"There's like a mix of British Isle stuff happening."
52:11;52:13;"Right. Western European."
52:13;52:15;"Okay, so I think you've made a strong case for Thin Lizzy."
52:15;52:19;"Notice how I haven't said this whole show that you think Thin Lizzy are trash."
52:19;52:24;"Because I think actually Thin Lizzy resonates with the kids today."
52:24;52:26;"What do you think, Ezra/Emma?"
52:26;52:28;"Kane Higgs?"
52:28;52:30;"I think Thin Lizzy are great."
52:30;52:31;"I love their sound."
52:31;52:33;"That's the kind of rock music that I like."
52:33;52:35;"Minimalist stuff."
52:35;52:36;"I like the guitar sound."
52:36;52:39;"And there's that feeling that it's like proto-New Wave to me."
52:39;52:41;"That's what I like."
52:41;52:43;"I like that and I like Dino's barn girl."
52:43;52:48;"Okay, Jake, so let's wrap things up with one last song from Thin Lizzy."
52:48;52:49;"Phil and the Boys."
52:49;52:50;"Okay."
52:50;52:54;"Let's do another one off of Jailbreak."
52:54;52:55;"One of my favorite songs by them."
52:55;52:57;"It's called ""Running Back."""
52:57;53:00;"And it's just like an awesome little pop song."

56:06;56:09;"And that wraps up our Thin Lizzy segment."
56:09;56:12;"Thank you, Jake, for teaching the world..."
56:12;56:13;"Absolutely."
56:13;56:14;"...about Thin Lizzy in 2015."
56:14;56:17;"You're listening to..."
56:17;56:18;"Time Crisis..."
56:18;56:20;"...on Beats 1."
56:20;56:25;"We've just been joined in the studio by your brother, Dave Longstrap."
56:25;56:26;"Thanks for being here."
56:26;56:27;"[ Laughter ]"
56:27;56:29;"Thanks for coming, Dave."
56:29;56:30;"Good to be here."
56:30;56:33;"Um, we opened up the questions bag recently on Twitter,"
56:33;56:35;"and, uh, 'cause it's your first time on the show,"
56:35;56:39;"maybe we'll just get things started by asking you a few random Internet questions."
56:39;56:40;"Oh, Jesus."
56:40;56:42;"First one, this is an interesting question."
56:42;56:45;"You think Obama has ever watched hentai?"
56:45;56:46;"No, I don't."
56:46;56:47;"Okay."
56:47;56:48;"What's hentai?"
56:48;56:50;"Hentai is, like, anime porn."
56:50;56:51;"Mm."
56:51;56:55;"There was a funny time where Obama was, like, I think he was in Japan,"
56:55;56:58;"or maybe he was hosting the Japanese prime minister,"
56:58;57:02;"and, um, he was, like, kind of shouting him out, and in his speech he said..."
57:02;57:06;"Today's also a chance for Americans, especially our young people,"
57:06;57:09;"to say thank you for all the things we love from Japan,"
57:09;57:12;"like karate and karaoke."
57:12;57:13;"Karaoke."
57:13;57:14;"Manga."
57:15;57:16;"And anime."
57:16;57:17;"Anime."
57:17;57:19;"And, of course, emojis."
57:19;57:21;"[ Laughter ]"
57:21;57:24;"Basically he's saying karaoke, anime, and manga."
57:24;57:25;"Oh."
57:25;57:26;"I mean, I'm saying it with my American accent."
57:26;57:27;"Yeah, yeah."
57:27;57:30;"Probably somebody briefed him and was like, ""This is the most Japanese way to say it."""
57:30;57:31;"Oh, my God."
57:31;57:33;"But so the--and you can tell--look at the video."
57:33;57:38;"The Japanese prime minister is kind of just, like, so, like, kind of, like, shocked and amused by it."
57:38;57:41;"In America, we love your karaoke, anime."
57:41;57:42;"George Bush never would have done that."
57:42;57:43;"Anime."
57:43;57:44;"And manga."
57:45;57:48;"Obama just has the deepest Texan drawl."
57:48;57:49;"Anime."
57:50;57:52;"Karaoke."
57:52;57:53;"Karaoke."
57:53;57:55;"Here's an interesting one, Dave."
57:55;57:59;"This comes from a Twitter user, existentialbree."
57:59;58:04;"In a postmodern, hyperreal world, is music a fashion choice in musicians' designers?"
58:04;58:05;"Sure."
58:05;58:09;"You heard it here first, existentialbree."
58:09;58:10;"I'm not into that."
58:10;58:11;"You're not into that?"
58:11;58:12;"No."
58:12;58:13;"You know, giving in."
58:13;58:14;"Giving into what?"
58:14;58:15;"Fashion?"
58:15;58:16;"Just nothing meaning anything."
58:16;58:19;"The three of us have kind of had a similar conversation before."
58:19;58:25;"And Ezra, I always remember when you were like, ""Music is, like, one part fashion and one part art."""
58:25;58:26;"Did I say that?"
58:26;58:27;"Yeah, you did."
58:27;58:28;"I stand by that."
58:28;58:29;"Yeah."
58:29;58:30;"And--"
58:30;58:31;"Although maybe it's shifted."
58:31;58:34;"Maybe today, if you're cooking up some music, you might want to add two parts fashion, one"
58:34;58:36;"part art to one part art."
58:36;58:37;"New recipe."
58:37;58:39;"See, I liked it when it was one-to-one."
58:39;58:41;"Who do you feel like is a classic example?"
58:41;58:42;"Of one-to-one ratio?"
58:42;58:43;"One-to-one."
58:43;58:44;"The Beatles?"
58:44;58:46;"Right, and a lot of people-- I think we should point out that a lot of people are sitting"
58:46;58:50;"at home saying, ""I don't think the Beatles-- with fashion."""
58:50;58:55;"But the truth is, the Beatles, from day one, they were wearing a very specific type of suit."
58:55;58:57;"They were wearing those collarless suits."
58:57;58:58;"That was Brian Epstein's idea."
58:58;58:59;"Oh, was it his idea?"
58:59;59:00;"Mm-hmm."
59:00;59:01;"They hated those suits."
59:01;59:02;"The long hair."
59:02;59:04;"And plus, I mean, changing the look of every album."
59:04;59:06;"And all dressing the same way."
59:06;59:07;"It was super concerted."
59:07;59:08;"It was the first boy band."
59:08;59:14;"But what's weird, to receive that music as the children of boomers, is that the fashion"
59:14;59:20;"has faded, and we're more inclined to just see it as the music."
59:20;59:21;"Right."
59:21;59:22;"The art part of it."
59:22;59:23;"The fashion is disposable."
59:23;59:27;"And so that's why you get a lot of people today saying, ""Oh, look at all these people."
59:27;59:29;"Look at Miley Cyrus doing this and that."""
59:29;59:31;"The Beatles used to be about the music."
59:31;59:38;"If you look at Sgt. Peppers, that's one of the most fashion-y, artificial, weird albums ever."
59:38;59:39;"Yeah."
59:39;59:40;"We just got a follow-up question, Dave."
59:40;59:41;"I'm curious to hear this from you."
59:41;59:42;"Favorite Beatles song?"
59:42;59:43;"I don't know."
59:43;59:44;"That's hard."
59:44;59:46;"Least favorite Beatles song?"
59:46;59:50;"Maybe one of the George Harrison songs from the White Album."
59:50;59:51;"Sorry."
59:51;59:52;"Oh, like ""Piggies""?"
59:52;59:53;"That's what I was thinking of."
59:53;59:54;"I kind of like ""Piggies."""
59:54;59:55;"The other one."
59:55;59:56;"Savoy Truffle?"
59:56;59:57;"Yeah, exactly."
59:57;59:58;"That's a random one."
59:58;01:00:01;"I was going to suggest maybe we play some Beatles, but you actually are not allowed"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"to play Beatles on streaming services."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"And I wanted to do a Bob Seger segment next week."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"And you can't play Bob Seger either."
01:00:07;01:00:08;"Those are the big two."
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Guess that's out."
01:00:09;01:00:13;"I think what happened was Bob Seger put his foot down a while ago, and the Beatles kind"
01:00:13;01:00:17;"of said, ""Is Bob really not going to have his music on streaming services?"""
01:00:17;01:00:20;"Let's take a page from Bob."
01:00:20;01:00:24;"Let's take a page from the Seger playbook."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"How about we listen to..."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"French Montana."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"Here's French Montana with ""Don't Panic."""
01:00:30;01:00:33;"Don't panic."

01:07:15;01:07:17;"Buck quiet, talk about Mikasa."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"You TMZ, got, got, got, got."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"Off the rip."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Off the rip."
01:07:22;01:07:24;"Off the mother, mother, rip, boy."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"An unexpected French Montana block."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"That's what happens when you get Dave Longstreth in the studio."
01:07:39;01:07:46;"Um, Dave, one thing we like to do on Time Crisis is usually count down the top five songs on iTunes."
01:07:46;01:07:49;"As a way of exploring the pop cultural landscape."
01:07:49;01:07:52;"Today, because I knew we were going to have such a powerhouse panel,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"two Kanics, two Longstreths,"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"we decided to get a little more complicated."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"And we're going to be examining, in real time, two top fives."
01:08:00;01:08:07;"The Billboard Top Five of this week, as well as the Billboard Top Five of this week, 30 years ago, in 1985."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"So we're going to be going song for song."
01:08:09;01:08:15;"So here is a very special, double Jeopardy edition of the Top Five."
01:08:15;01:08:20;"It's time for the Top Five."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"This is pretty Back to the Future II right now."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"Oh, what, the years?"
01:08:24;01:08:27;"Yeah, it was '85 and 2015."
01:08:27;01:08:32;"So Back to the Future took place in 1985 and he went ahead 30 years."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"Yup, when Biff was an old man."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"And he was like, ""Nobody knows how to start that car but me."""
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Right."
01:08:37;01:08:39;"Okay, so this is actually, alright, I like that you pointed that out."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"This is the Back to the Future edition."
01:08:41;01:08:47;"And in '80, and when he went back to '55, there was an emphasis on the music of that era."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"Right."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"Earth Angel."
01:08:49;01:08:51;"Well, get ready to have your mind blown."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"Because..."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"This is your cousin."
01:08:53;01:08:59;"So Dave, this might blow your mind, but the number five song on the Billboard charts 30 years ago"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"was Huey Lewis' ""The Power of Love,"" which is from Back to the Future."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"That only blows my mind that it's not number one."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Yeah, it was only number five."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"Maybe it was number one."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"We're not going to look into that."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"So let's listen to a little bit of this."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love."""
01:09:31;01:09:35;"The power of love is a curious thing"
01:09:35;01:09:39;"Make a one man weep, make another man sing"
01:09:39;01:09:43;"Change a hawk to a little white dove"
01:09:43;01:09:48;"Born with a feeling, that's the power of love"
01:09:51;01:09:55;"Toughen the diamonds, rich like cream"
01:09:55;01:09:59;"Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream"
01:09:59;01:10:03;"Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right"
01:10:03;01:10:07;"Power of love will keep you home at night"
01:10:07;01:10:12;"Don't need money, don't take fame"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Don't need no credit card to write your name"
01:10:14;01:10:18;"That's Huey Lewis and the News with ""The Power of Love,"" top five single in 1985."
01:10:18;01:10:22;"What's its counterpart this week in 2015?"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"It's one of our favorite songs of the summer. You know what I'm talking about."
01:10:25;01:10:27;"Only, ""Cheerleader."""
01:10:30;01:10:31;"Better song."
01:10:31;01:10:32;"Yeah."
01:10:32;01:10:33;"[laughter]"
01:10:33;01:10:34;"I agree."
01:10:34;01:10:38;"""Cheerleader"" mobs the floor with ""The Power of Love."" No disrespect to Huey Lewis, who's a great songwriter."
01:10:39;01:10:42;"When I need motivation"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"My one solution is my queen"
01:10:44;01:10:47;"'Cause she's this strong, yeah"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"She is always in my corner, right there"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"When I wanna, all these other girls are tempting"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"But I'm empty when you're gone"
01:10:55;01:10:58;"And they say, ""Do you need me?"""
01:10:58;01:11:00;"""Do you think I'm pretend?"""
01:11:00;01:11:02;"""Do I make you feel like cheating?"""
01:11:02;01:11:04;"I'm like, ""No, not really,"" 'cause"
01:11:04;01:11:09;"Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"She is always right there when I need her"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"I just learned that he was saying ""cheerleader,"" like, a week ago."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"What'd you think it was?"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"I didn't know."
01:11:20;01:11:23;"Wait, so you heard that song on the radio, you had no idea that he was saying ""cheerleader""?"
01:11:23;01:11:24;"No, I was just content--"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Cheerleader, yeah"
01:11:26;01:11:29;"--content to hear the melody without knowing what the words were."
01:11:29;01:11:31;"It's a beautiful song, so I guess--"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"So we're off to an interesting start."
01:11:33;01:11:38;"I think our first piece of evidence suggests that 2015 is better than 1985."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"[laughs]"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"And also more nuanced in feeling."
01:11:42;01:11:44;"I love that he's talking about, like,"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"I don't really feel that way."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"It's like, just a shade of a feeling."
01:11:48;01:11:53;"Whereas Huey Lewis is talking about this, just like, power of love, that sounds like, I don't know."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Right, that's when people use--"
01:11:54;01:11:55;"Propagandist, like--"
01:11:55;01:12:00;"Like, yeah, when people believe that their narrative was universally true."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"Right."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"Now it's more specific."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Yeah, and I also just want to point out another way to compare these songs is,"
01:12:04;01:12:10;"""Omi,"" ""Cheerleader,"" the big hit version is a remix by, like, a German teenager."
01:12:10;01:12:11;"Omi's from Jamaica."
01:12:11;01:12:17;"So this song is a Jamaican guy and a German guy who never met making a hit song together."
01:12:17;01:12:22;"Whereas the power of love is Huey Lewis and the News, a bunch of guys from the Bay Area."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"From Marin County."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"A Marin County bar band."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Bar and grill band."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"A bar and grill band, which is not necessarily a bad thing."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Okay, so now let's go back to 1985."
01:12:32;01:12:35;"The number four song this week in 1985."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"Man, I don't really remember this song."
01:12:37;01:12:40;"This is ""Cool and the Gang,"" who are an amazing band, with ""Cherish."""
01:12:40;01:12:43;"I feel like it's going to be a ballad."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"No idea."
01:13:00;01:13:06;"Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore."
01:13:06;01:13:10;"Hand in hand, you and I."
01:13:10;01:13:16;"Let's cherish every moment we have been given."
01:13:16;01:13:22;"The time is passing by."
01:13:22;01:13:30;"I often pray before I lay down by your side."
01:13:30;01:13:40;"If you receive your calling before I awake, could I make it through the night?"
01:13:40;01:13:44;"Cherish the love we have."
01:13:44;01:13:50;"We should cherish the life we live."
01:13:50;01:13:53;"Cherish the love."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Cherish the love."
01:13:55;01:13:58;"Cherish the love."
01:13:58;01:14:01;"Now, I want to know, was that an intro, or was that like a verse?"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Are we going to get more of that?"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"No, this is the chorus."
01:14:05;01:14:08;"No, no, I know this is, but that first section was so weak."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Oh, like the drums are going to drop out again?"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"Yeah."
01:14:11;01:14:16;"Yeah, that's one of those songs where you're like, ""This sucks,"" and then the chorus drops, and you're like, ""Oh, yeah."""
01:14:16;01:14:19;"Which is kind of a good kind of song."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"This is an interesting comparison."
01:14:21;01:14:26;"So, ""Cool and the Gang,"" ""Cherish,"" number four on the charts in 1985."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"What's its counterpart today?"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"This is a song that's been in the news recently, ""Watch Me Whip, Watch Me Nae Nae."""
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I know the dance."
01:14:56;01:14:58;"It's like that."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Okay."
01:15:06;01:15:09;"""Watch Me Whip, Watch Me Nae Nae,"" a great song."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Wait, that's been in the news recently?"
01:15:10;01:15:20;"It's been in the news recently because everybody and their mother is now doing this dance, including the mother of Chelsea Clinton, Hillary."
01:15:20;01:15:23;"Yeah, she went on Ellen, and she did the ""Watch Me Whip."""
01:15:23;01:15:24;"That's brutal."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"Bernie got to do that."
01:15:26;01:15:27;"Yeah, Bernie wouldn't do that."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"No."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"Sure he would."
01:15:29;01:15:30;"No, he won't."
01:15:30;01:15:31;"We'll see."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Bernie's saving up for a far more elaborate dance."
01:15:33;01:15:37;"Yeah, he's going to do the full Gangnam Style."
01:15:37;01:15:40;"He's going to do the Macarena."
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:15:41;01:15:42;"Hillary."
01:15:42;01:15:43;"What do you guys think about Hillary?"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"We were asked about Bernie earlier."
01:15:45;01:15:46;"Who asked you about Bernie?"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Oh, somebody on Twitter?"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"Yeah, somebody from the question bag."
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I can't get excited about Hillary."
01:15:51;01:15:55;"I mean, so you imagine 1985, Reagan was-"
01:15:55;01:15:56;"They're chilling in Little Rock."
01:15:57;01:15:59;"Reagan is president."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"The actor?"
01:16:00;01:16:01;"The actor."
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Good call."
01:16:02;01:16:07;"Who's president in 1985, future boy?"
01:16:07;01:16:13;"Thirty years later, Hillary might be president, and she's whipping and nae-nae-ing on TV."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"I mean, that's just sad pandering."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"It's just like-"
01:16:16;01:16:17;"Is it?"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"Maybe she wants to whip, man."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"Maybe that's her true soul."
01:16:20;01:16:21;"No."
01:16:21;01:16:23;"Do you guys honestly think that for one second?"
01:16:23;01:16:24;"No."
01:16:24;01:16:29;"It was clearly her communications director was like, ""This is a popular song, and we"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"have this TV appearance lined up with-"" Was it Ellen?"
01:16:32;01:16:33;"It was Ellen, yes."
01:16:33;01:16:34;"Jesus."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"This is like-"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Well, also-"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"Maybe I'm being too real."
01:16:38;01:16:45;"That's that part of politics where you have to- It's about drawing together different"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"constituencies."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Why not?"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"She's dancing."
01:16:48;01:16:51;"It's about going viral in 2015."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Politics."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"She's trying to go viral."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"She just wants to get those clicks."
01:16:54;01:16:56;"But in the most inauthentic way."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"Bernie's going viral on his own terms."
01:16:58;01:16:59;"Yeah."
01:16:59;01:17:00;"I don't think anyone sees-"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"What's an example of Bernie's virality, though?"
01:17:02;01:17:05;"He's leading in the polls in New Hampshire and Iowa."
01:17:05;01:17:10;"Yeah, he's doing okay, but deep down, Jake, you're a huge music fan, right?"
01:17:10;01:17:11;"Yeah."
01:17:11;01:17:13;"Music's a big part of your life, including popular music."
01:17:13;01:17:14;"Yeah."
01:17:14;01:17:22;"I think of a president who's committed to closing the income gap and bombing other countries"
01:17:22;01:17:26;"less, or a president who actually has their finger on the pulse of pop culture."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"You're right, Ezra."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Hillary 2016."
01:17:29;01:17:34;"When I think of a candidate that has their finger on the pulse of pop culture, it's obviously"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Hillary."
01:17:35;01:17:36;"That's right."
01:17:36;01:17:37;"Compared to Bernie."
01:17:37;01:17:38;"She makes Bernie look old."
01:17:38;01:17:43;"So, we've established across the board enthusiastic support for Hillary Clinton in the Time Crisis"
01:17:43;01:17:44;"studio."
01:17:44;01:17:48;"Back to 1985, Hillary's in Little Rock with Bill."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Cherish the love."
01:17:49;01:17:52;"This was the number three song on the charts."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"This was by a little band called Dire Straits."
01:17:54;01:17:55;"Oh."
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Money for nothing."
01:18:37;01:18:58;"So, that was the number three song on the charts in 1985, Money for Nothing by Dire Straits."
01:18:58;01:19:04;"In the full version, that song is eight minutes and 26 seconds."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"That's amazing."
01:19:05;01:19:06;"Which is crazy."
01:19:06;01:19:07;"Amazing?"
01:19:07;01:19:08;"I don't know if it's amazing."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"By amazing, I mean appalling."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"Appalling."
01:19:12;01:19:18;"The number three song on the charts in 2015 is by another foreigner."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Dire Straits were from England."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"This is another foreigner, Justin Bieber from Canada."
01:19:22;01:19:23;"What do you mean?"
01:19:23;01:19:26;"Coming in at a lean three minutes and 28."
01:19:26;01:19:28;"You guys already know I love this song."
01:19:28;01:19:33;"You know what I realized the other day when I heard this on the radio?"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"That's a clock ticking."
01:19:34;01:19:36;"Yeah, I was just thinking that."
01:19:39;01:19:53;"Yeah, the stuff from '85 is sounding super stiff."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"2015's mopping the floor."
01:19:55;01:19:56;"Kind of is."
01:19:56;01:19:57;"[laughs]"
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Sounding so, yeah, one-dimensional."
01:20:02;01:20:06;"The pitch bending on the pan flutes."
01:20:06;01:20:07;"Have you seen the video for this?"
01:20:07;01:20:10;"There's all these drawings projected on him while he's dancing."
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Oh, and he's like killing people?"
01:20:12;01:20:13;"No."
01:20:13;01:20:14;"Yeah."
01:20:14;01:20:16;"No, you're thinking of Where Are You Now, maybe."
01:20:16;01:20:17;"Oh."
01:20:17;01:20:18;"Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right."
01:20:18;01:20:20;"Where Are You Now, What Do You Mean?"
01:20:20;01:20:23;"This is kind of like the game, that movie with Michael Douglas."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Right, that's the one I'm thinking of."
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Yeah."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Fincher film."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"Number three on the charts, Justin Bieber, What Do You Mean?"
01:20:28;01:20:32;"Clearly a superior song to Money for Nothing by dire straits."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"The entire studio is in agreement."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"Yep."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Such a beautiful song."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"You know, it was interesting, Dave, you were pointing out how all that music from the '80s"
01:20:39;01:20:44;"has this kind of aggressive rightness, like cheerleader."
01:20:44;01:20:47;"It's almost like, ooh, I think I found myself cheerleader."
01:20:47;01:20:50;"That stuff from the '80s is like, ""It's the power of love."""
01:20:50;01:20:51;"Yeah."
01:20:51;01:20:55;"It's almost like, it's aggressive, it's very sure of itself."
01:20:55;01:20:59;"One thing that's interesting about Justin Bieber lately is he's become pop music's question"
01:20:59;01:21:00;"king."
01:21:00;01:21:01;"What do you mean?"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"He's asking questions."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"What do you mean?"
01:21:04;01:21:05;"And the big single this summer was Where Are You Now."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"New phone, who is this?"
01:21:06;01:21:07;"That's a nice single."
01:21:07;01:21:08;"That's dropping next week."
01:21:08;01:21:09;"New phone, who's this?"
01:21:09;01:21:17;"So Justin Bieber, one of the biggest pop stars in the world, he's asking questions."
01:21:17;01:21:22;"In the '80s, pop stars would just come out and say declarative statements."
01:21:22;01:21:23;"Wow."
01:21:23;01:21:24;"Love this."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"Wait, Jake, think of a song in the '80s where they're asking questions."
01:21:26;01:21:29;"God, put me on the spot."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"There's got to be an epic one."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"I don't think so."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"All I'm saying is Justin Bieber."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"Reagan had the answers."
01:21:34;01:21:40;"No, because Ronald Reagan, he was all about this kind of old school American narrative."
01:21:40;01:21:45;"He was all about fighting the evil empire, black and white, right?"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Whereas today-"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"It's all gray."
01:21:48;01:21:49;"It's gray."
01:21:49;01:21:50;"We got Obama talking about anime."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"You could say-"
01:21:51;01:21:55;"You could say Springsteen, Born in the USA was a question."
01:21:55;01:22:01;"It was a question disguised as an authoritative statement."
01:22:01;01:22:08;"It's a very triumphant, huge chorus declaring that I was born in the USA, but then the verses"
01:22:08;01:22:12;"are all just about these sad Vietnam vets that can't get jobs."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"So it is sort of like a question."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"It's a stretch."
01:22:16;01:22:19;"Justin Bieber is much better at posing questions than Springsteen."
01:22:19;01:22:20;"Let's get back to 19-"
01:22:20;01:22:27;"When it comes to ambiguity and rich songwriting, Bieber is just crushing Springsteen."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"That's right."
01:22:28;01:22:31;"Bieber Clinton 2016."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Let's get back to 1985."
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Wow."
01:22:33;01:22:38;"A lot of soundtrack songs were in the charts in 1985 because we had The Power of Love from"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Back to the Future."
01:22:39;01:22:44;"And then the number on the charts then was We Don't Need Another Hero from Mad Max."
01:22:44;01:22:49;"Speaking of things coming full circle, we just had a Mad Max film in the theaters."
01:22:49;01:22:51;"Thirty years ago, what did they have?"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"A Mad Max film in the theaters."
01:22:53;01:22:57;"Here's Tina Turner with We Don't Need Another Hero in parentheses."
01:22:57;01:22:58;"Thunderdome."
01:22:58;01:22:59;"What was that?"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"A little bit of a hand fluke."
01:23:00;01:23:01;"It kind of sounds like the Justin Bieber song."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Yeah."
01:23:02;01:23:31;"Wow, she sounds like she's had a rough night."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"Some real character in that voice."
01:23:32;01:23:33;"I like it."
01:23:33;01:23:34;"I don't know this song."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"Some patina."
01:23:35;01:23:36;"You might recognize the chorus."
01:23:36;01:24:00;"I don't know the chorus."
01:24:00;01:24:15;"That was Tina Turner with We Don't Need Another Hero, Thunderdome from the film Mad Max Beyond"
01:24:15;01:24:16;"Thunderdome."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"That was the number two on the charts in 1985."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"What's its counterpart today?"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Well, it's our old friend The Weeknd."
01:24:22;01:24:27;"He's been tearing up the charts all summer long with The Hills."
01:24:27;01:24:30;"A real hot summer song."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"Wait, is this the 531?"
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Yeah, this is the only one."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"It's half past five."
01:24:34;01:24:35;"What is he saying about Promo?"
01:24:35;01:24:57;"I don't know."
01:24:58;01:25:25;"I don't know."
01:25:25;01:25:29;"So Dave, to answer your question, the opening lyrics to this song are, ""Your man on the"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"road, he doing promo."
01:25:30;01:25:33;"You said keep our business on the low low."""
01:25:33;01:25:38;"Now, for people who don't work in the music industry, when you're out on the road doing"
01:25:38;01:25:42;"promo, that means you're doing interviews."
01:25:42;01:25:47;"I don't know what other industries besides showbiz people say people go on the road doing"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"promo."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"Roofing."
01:25:49;01:25:52;"Farm equipment."
01:25:52;01:25:58;"So it sounds to me like The Weeknd is having sex with somebody whose husband probably sells"
01:25:58;01:25:59;"farming equipment."
01:25:59;01:26:02;"He's probably out in Nashville for a conference."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"I didn't realize that this song was also about cheating."
01:26:05;01:26:09;"Authorized John Deere dealership."
01:26:09;01:26:14;"And little does he know The Weeknd is up in his mansion in the Hollywood Hills having"
01:26:14;01:26:15;"sex with his girlfriend."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"I don't know."
01:26:16;01:26:18;"Is the Tina Turner song better or The Weeknd song?"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"They're both kind of harsh."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Kind of dark."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Both have great voices."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"I think we got to go The Weeknd."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"I think we got to go The Weeknd."
01:26:25;01:26:29;"But I think what we're noticing, as Dave pointed out on the first song, the modern songs have"
01:26:29;01:26:31;"a lot of ambiguity."
01:26:31;01:26:38;"This song is literally about cheating on somebody and you only have sex with them at 530 AM."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"Everything about it is kind of ambiguous."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"What is it?"
01:26:42;01:26:43;"What kind of relationship is that?"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"I guess that's what the song's exploring."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"What does he say in the bridge?"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"On the hills?"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"Yeah."
01:26:49;01:26:50;"Is there..."
01:26:50;01:26:51;"The hills have eyes."
01:26:51;01:26:52;"The hills have..."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"You know what's really funny?"
01:26:53;01:26:57;"Just reading the lyrics without hearing the music, because this actually sounds like some"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"old timey preacher."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Hills have eyes."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"The hills have eyes."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Who are you to judge?"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Hide your lies, girl."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"Hide your lies."
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Only you to trust."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Only you."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"You heard it here first from The Weeknd."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"The hills have eyes."
01:27:10;01:27:13;"The hills have eyes is a horror film."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Who are you to judge?"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"It's like The Weeknd is literally looking at the Hollywood Hills and saying, ""Don't"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"judge me, Hills."""
01:27:20;01:27:21;"You're all doing it."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"I like this song."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"This song's growing on me more and more."
01:27:24;01:27:27;"The more we explore the lyrics, I love this song."
01:27:27;01:27:31;"Okay, are you guys ready for the number one songs of 1985 and 2015?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"Oh yeah."
01:27:32;01:27:37;"The number one song this week in 1985 was also from a film."
01:27:37;01:27:42;"It was from St. Elmo's Fire, and the song is called St. Elmo's Fire by John Parr."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Do you guys remember this?"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Instrumental?"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"My bad."
01:27:46;01:27:49;"You're thinking of Beverly Hills Cops, too?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Yeah."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"Wait, who is this by?"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"John Parr."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"Is this the chorus?"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"That key change was so '80s."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Yeah."
01:28:57;01:28:57;"Wait, guys."
01:28:57;01:28:59;"I don't really know this song well,"
01:28:59;01:29:02;"but I just remembered that I was told a hilarious story about it."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"I don't know this person well, but I"
01:29:04;01:29:07;"spent some time with Rob Lowe once, who was in this film."
01:29:07;01:29:08;"And he's a big music buff."
01:29:08;01:29:12;"And it was kind of amazing hearing him talk about '80s music."
01:29:12;01:29:13;"And I remember him telling this story,"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"but at the time I didn't know the song that was."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"I couldn't really put it into context."
01:29:16;01:29:20;"And he was saying, you know, the theme from ""St. Elmo's Fire"""
01:29:20;01:29:24;"is written by this very famous songwriter, David Foster."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"He's a very accomplished songwriter,"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"big in the music industry."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"And he told the story that David Foster"
01:29:30;01:29:35;"had agreed to write a theme song for a wheelchair-bound Canadian"
01:29:35;01:29:40;"man who was going across the country."
01:29:40;01:29:42;"And basically, a wheelchair-bound Canadian man who"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"was kind of doing an inspirational,"
01:29:44;01:29:48;"maybe to raise money, kind of tour across the country"
01:29:48;01:29:51;"where he was going to be making a way across Canada"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"in his wheelchair."
01:29:52;01:29:55;"But he'd also agreed to do the ""St. Elmo's Fire"" theme."
01:29:55;01:29:57;"And he didn't have time to write two songs."
01:29:57;01:29:57;"Oh my god."
01:29:57;01:29:58;"So--"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"Doubled up."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"So he wrote-- so technically, ""St. Elmo's Fire"""
01:30:01;01:30:04;"is called ""St. Elmo's Fire Man in Motion."""
01:30:04;01:30:06;"And if you look at the chorus, it's"
01:30:06;01:30:09;"""I can see the new horizon underneath the blazing sky."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"I'll be where the eagle's flying, higher and higher."
01:30:12;01:30:13;"Gonna be your man in motion."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"All I need is a pair of wheels."
01:30:15;01:30:19;"Take me where my future's lying, St. Elmo's Fire."""
01:30:19;01:30:20;"That is--"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"And I never saw ""St. Elmo's Fire,"""
01:30:21;01:30:22;"but I don't think there's anybody in a wheelchair."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"I don't believe so."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"Never saw it."
01:30:24;01:30:25;"I love it."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"David Foster, you're a legend for that one."
01:30:27;01:30:28;"Right."
01:30:28;01:30:31;"A true pragmatist there."
01:30:31;01:30:32;"A true 1980s--"
01:30:32;01:30:34;"Terrible song."
01:30:34;01:30:35;"OK, yeah."
01:30:35;01:30:38;"We didn't talk about the quality of the song."
01:30:38;01:30:39;"You're not feeling ""St. Elmo's Fire""?"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"This is the worst thing of the top five."
01:30:41;01:30:44;"That probably was the worst song that we've heard so far."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"But that was number one?"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"That was number one."
01:30:47;01:30:47;"Wow."
01:30:47;01:30:50;"Someone was buying a seven inch of that, a cassette single."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"B-side, instrumental version?"
01:30:52;01:30:53;"Yeah."
01:30:53;01:30:53;"I think--"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"David Parr, full length."
01:30:56;01:30:59;"I think we're about to come up with the most extreme contrast"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"of our top five experiment."
01:31:01;01:31:06;"The number one song in 1985 was ""St. Elmo's Fire,"""
01:31:06;01:31:11;"this weird half wheelchair, half '80s movie song."
01:31:11;01:31:16;"And the number one song in 2015 is this gem from The Weeknd."
01:31:16;01:31:23;"[MUSIC - THE WEEKND, ""ST. ELMO'S FIRE""]"
01:31:23;01:31:25;"And I know she'll be the death of me."
01:31:25;01:31:27;"At least we'll both be numb."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"And she'll always get the best of me."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"The worst is yet to come."
01:31:32;01:31:34;"But at least we'll both be beautiful"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"and stay forever young."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"This I know."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"This I know."
01:31:40;01:31:44;"She told me don't worry about it."
01:31:44;01:31:49;"She told me don't worry no more."
01:31:49;01:31:53;"We both know we can't go without it."
01:31:53;01:31:59;"She told me you'll never be alone."
01:31:59;01:32:03;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you."
01:32:03;01:32:05;"But I love it."
01:32:05;01:32:08;"But I love it."
01:32:08;01:32:12;"I can't feel my face when I'm with you."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"But I love it."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"But I love it."
01:32:16;01:32:19;"Oh, and I know she'll be the death of me."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"At least we'll both be numb."
01:32:21;01:32:23;"And she'll always get the best of me."

01:32:25;01:32:26;"All the misery--"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"Song of the summer, still number one,"
01:32:29;01:32:30;"""The Weeknd"" with ""Can't Feel My Face."""
01:32:30;01:32:33;"I mean, that's an extreme contrast, ""St. Elmo's Fire"""
01:32:33;01:32:34;"versus ""Can't Feel My Face."""
01:32:34;01:32:35;"That's crazy."
01:32:35;01:32:38;"Again, 2015, mopping the floor."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Mopping the floor."
01:32:39;01:32:41;"I wouldn't have thought that was the case."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"I want to point out, this was originally"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"Jake's idea to do this segment, was"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"to bring in the top five of 1985."
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Yeah, you didn't think it was going to be this bad."
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I didn't think it would be this bad."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"I mean, I thought '85 would be interesting."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"Right."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"I mean, nice round number 30 years ago."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Right."
01:32:55;01:33:02;"'95, '75, it seemed like '85 was a good choice, but wow."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"This is also just a very strong top five right now."
01:33:05;01:33:06;"Yes."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"That we're having in 20--"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Well, you know what's-- it's making me--"
01:33:08;01:33:09;"hearing the '85 stuff is making me"
01:33:09;01:33:11;"appreciate the 2015 stuff more."
01:33:11;01:33:15;"If we just did a cold listen on the 2015 stuff,"
01:33:15;01:33:18;"I'd probably be bringing a higher degree of skepticism"
01:33:18;01:33:18;"or something."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"It was something about the compare and contrast."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"I'm just like--"
01:33:21;01:33:23;"2015 is funky."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"Right, well, I think a lot of people--"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"people always forget how bad the past was,"
01:33:27;01:33:30;"because you can look at the past in rose-colored glasses."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Well, the good stuff rises to the top, too."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"I mean, the stuff--"
01:33:34;01:33:38;"the chorus of Cherish by Kool and the Gang was dope."
01:33:38;01:33:39;"Yes."
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Yeah, I mean, there were good things going on in 1985,"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"right?"
01:33:42;01:33:42;"Yeah."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"President Reagan."
01:33:43;01:33:44;"For one."
01:33:44;01:33:46;"What was '85?"
01:33:46;01:33:47;"I mean, I'll just say in general--"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"No, maybe Making Sense was '84."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"1980-- I don't know if this--"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"Ghostbusters was '84."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"This stuff didn't necessarily come out in 1985."
01:33:53;01:33:57;"I'm just saying that was the era of Michael, Prince, Bruce,"
01:33:57;01:33:58;"Madonna."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Those were the superstars of the era."
01:34:00;01:34:02;"And that's a pretty idiosyncratic mix."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"Yeah."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"No, for sure."
01:34:04;01:34:05;"Wrestlemania."
01:34:05;01:34:06;"That was the first one?"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"The first Wrestlemania was 1985."
01:34:08;01:34:11;"That's actually an interesting-- one of our producers"
01:34:11;01:34:13;"is pointing out that the first Wrestlemania was 1985."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"It's interesting, because in some ways,"
01:34:15;01:34:19;"modern pop culture actually has learned a lot from Wrestlemania."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"Oh my god, I just realized a really weird thing."
01:34:21;01:34:21;"What?"
01:34:21;01:34:22;"Oh my god, you guys."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"I just realized a super weird thing."
01:34:25;01:34:29;"1985, number one single was the questionable song,"
01:34:29;01:34:33;"""St. Elmo's Fireman in Motion,"" written by David Foster."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"30 years later, the number one song"
01:34:35;01:34:37;"is ""Can't Feel My Face"" by The Weeknd."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"And as we were Googling The Weeknd,"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"it said that he's dating something"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"Hadid, who is the stepdaughter of David Foster."
01:34:44;01:34:44;"Wow."
01:34:44;01:34:45;"Whoa."
01:34:45;01:34:45;"Crazy."
01:34:45;01:34:46;"Full circle."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"You know what that says to me, though, more than anything?"
01:34:48;01:34:52;"Is that powerful families maintain power at all costs."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"It doesn't surprise me--"
01:34:54;01:34:55;"The kingdom."
01:34:55;01:34:57;"Yeah, that's how power works."
01:34:57;01:34:59;"It doesn't surprise me that two number one singles,"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"30 years apart, could all kind of come back to one family."
01:35:02;01:35:04;"That's how America works."
01:35:04;01:35:05;"That's true."
01:35:05;01:35:07;"That's sad and dark and true."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Now that I realize that, Jake, I"
01:35:09;01:35:12;"see why you like Bernie Sanders better than Hillary Clinton."
01:35:12;01:35:14;"Now I'm starting to see your point."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"I'm just the punk rock idealist over here."
01:35:17;01:35:20;"That was a hell of a top five."
01:35:20;01:35:24;"You're listening to Time Crisis on B1."
