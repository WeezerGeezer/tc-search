00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis back again. Many changes are afoot. From downtown Los Angeles all the"
00:10;00:15;"way to the United Kingdom we're joined in the studio by rock legend Rod Stewart."
00:15;00:22;"We talk about everything from trains to football to the tears of Hercules. This"
00:22;00:30;"is a very special Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:21;"Time Crisis back again. Hell of a show today. We'll be joined by rock legend Rod"
01:21;01:29;"Stewart in a little bit but first some truly shocking news this week. I kind of"
01:29;01:34;"can't believe it but we just found out Staples Center, beloved arena, maybe not"
01:34;01:39;"that beloved but an arena in downtown Los Angeles. It's where the Lakers play,"
01:39;01:44;"it's where the Clippers play, it's where the Kings play. It will be changing its"
01:44;01:49;"name because somebody knew about the rights and before we talk about it I was"
01:49;01:53;"I was just having this discussion with somebody. I broke the news to them."
01:53;01:57;"Actually it was a friend of the show Ariel Rechshied sitting in the studio with him"
01:57;02:01;"and I was like oh man and he was like what and I told him he's like old-school"
02:01;02:03;"LA dude I was like you're not gonna believe this they're changing the name"
02:03;02:08;"of Staples Center the first thing he says oh god what is it and so before I say it"
02:08;02:12;"I kind of remember I think we've talked about it on the show that the Staples"
02:12;02:18;"Center is one of the classiest arena names. We've had this discussion right?"
02:18;02:22;"I think so. You could be like the Dunkin Donuts Center in Rhode Island you could"
02:22;02:28;"end up being Smoothie King Arena where the Pelicans play in New Orleans but we"
02:28;02:31;"talked about the fact that is if you're gonna have a sponsored name you're not"
02:31;02:34;"gonna be Madison Square Garden you're gonna have a sponsored name there's"
02:34;02:38;"something about Staples Center that just sounds like somebody's name you don't"
02:38;02:43;"even think about the fact that it's a weird office supply chain and I believe"
02:43;02:48;"the discussion we had on TC went along the lines of like LA is so lucky imagine"
02:48;02:51;"if instead of Staples coming through with the naming rights it had been"
02:51;02:56;"Office Depot it would be just such a shame be such an embarrassment for the"
02:56;03:00;"city. LA is really lucky and then we even I believe we even had a discussion maybe"
03:00;03:06;"LA because it's LA they got all these offers Office Depot came through you"
03:06;03:10;"know who knows what else Burger King Taco Bell whatever and they said no no"
03:10;03:14;"no it has to sound good and then Staples came through and they said you got it"
03:14;03:19;"because that sounds good. We're the second biggest city in America we need"
03:19;03:24;"the money but we're not gonna take some dorky name that'd be an embarrassment to"
03:24;03:27;"the City of Angels so anyway they have this great name Staples Center and it"
03:27;03:32;"really goes down easy it's a win-win for everybody. Turns out that theory was"
03:32;03:38;"wrong. That theory was deeply wrong or a lot has changed in the past 22 years so"
03:38;03:42;"because we've had this discussion I was very interested to see what is the new"
03:42;03:46;"name of the Staples Center who bought the naming rights and what is this place"
03:46;03:50;"gonna become well I guess Seinfeld you're our number cruncher I'll let you"

04:26;04:31;"dropped the center I feel like they could have called it crypto center but"
04:31;04:36;"dot-com is kind of ruining it. It has to be crypto.com because that's the name of the"
04:36;04:43;"business if they just called it crypto center then you'd have all sorts of... That sounds terrifying. It's very Robocop."
04:43;04:48;"Civilian welcome to crypto center but crypto is too broad of a category"
04:48;04:52;"everybody in the crypto space benefits from the crypto center this is not about"
04:52;05:00;"coinbase it's not about friends with benefits it's not about NFT week this is"

06:38;06:44;"has a line that uses the phrase good old country mile he's talking about sex he"

06:48;06:53;"country mile but anyway I do love by a country mile and I'm glad that this"
06:53;06:58;"phrase is reentering the lexicon visa V Nick's friend and Rod Stewart that's a"

08:00;08:05;"is it I want to hear about his first trip to California oh love that all"
08:05;08:10;"right let's definitely ask him that yeah just piggybacking off of what Jake said"
08:10;08:14;"I actually when I wrote some notes one of them was kind of about just like it"
08:14;08:19;"seems like you can't he's kind of based in California so I was just kind of like"
08:19;08:25;"curious about how long he's been there is it weird being like an English dude"
08:25;08:31;"in Southern California yeah he's another I mean he makes me think of David Hockney"
08:31;08:34;"even though even though they have nothing in common but iconic blonde"
08:34;08:39;"Englishman that has been living in LA for decades actually that's a good"
08:39;08:43;"question too I think you should phrase it just like that like so Rod another"
08:43;08:47;"iconic blonde Englishman has been living in LA for decades David Hockney you guys"
08:47;08:50;"friends I think the answer will be yes there's no way they haven't like party"
08:50;08:55;"together yeah I think he lives in Malibu because he I don't know what we doing"
08:55;09:00;"the show right now what this is like yeah they were getting meta yeah yeah"
09:00;09:02;"we're no no this is good we're showing people behind the curtain this is our"
09:02;09:08;"show Daniel Ralston used to work at a bar at the Malibu Beach Inn which was"
09:08;09:13;"like a kind of a nice hotel in Malibu and Rod would come in with his mates and"
09:13;09:17;"watch football games oh his English mates he'd come in with his English"
09:17;09:22;"mates and watch the soccer games it like weird you know like one on the afternoon"
09:22;09:26;"when no one's in there just a ragtag group of Englishmen David Hockney Rod"
09:26;09:34;"Stewart Stephen Hawking Prince Charles I mean you got a picture Branson"
09:34;09:41;"oh yeah Richard Branson that's a good crew right there anyway the I can only um"
09:41;09:48;"I don't care personally that it's got this terrible name but if California"
09:48;09:53;"does fall into the sea within the next 20 years you heard it here first it's"
09:53;09:59;"because of this this brings some serious you know biblical type evil into the"
09:59;10:03;"Golden State I wish Warren Zeevon was still alive to write a song about this"
10:03;10:08;"oh god yeah he would love it it's really is like a perfect metaphor for like the"
10:08;10:14;"direction of our economy and society I mean the late 90s you know big-box"
10:14;10:19;"retailers were king yep and even if you know it was a little funny and tacky to"
10:19;10:26;"have Staples an office supply retailer big-box went out on the bidding war"
10:26;10:32;"granted with a classy name it's really you know the brick-and-mortar era is a"
10:32;10:37;"phasing out and we're gonna do this here for the next 20 years I also want to say"
10:37;10:41;"that we're not anti crypto on this show I mean we did a whole special about NFT"
10:41;10:48;"week with the desk spot so we're very pro crypto pro NFT are we well I don't"
10:48;10:54;"know about NFTs we never really we're not anti crypto I just want to say though"
10:54;10:58;"it's like one funny thing though is that when people talk about crypto and the"
10:58;11:02;"blockchain and how that could change the way that people interact and change"
11:02;11:09;"everything you know it would be cool if you told me that 1 million people on the"
11:09;11:13;"blockchain somehow came together to buy the naming rights for Staples Center and"
11:13;11:18;"they called it you know gave it some like crazy funny name"
11:18;11:25;"ass arena yeah even if they call it ass arena or if they just pick something"
11:25;11:29;"like you know it would be cool if you told me that 1 million people globally"
11:29;11:35;"using aetherium bought the naming rights and they bought it that's so it would"
11:35;11:39;"cost so much money it was the highest naming rights by many country miles like"
11:39;11:43;"they bought it for five billion dollars and they just named it a 200 digit"
11:43;11:49;"number you know something like weird like that like literally five seven nine"
11:49;11:54;"five one two three seven six oh zero zero you know arena and they're like for"
11:54;11:58;"short and it they just call it like like numbers arena or whatever I'd be like"
11:58;12:02;"all right that rules yeah this is the dream of just like weird happening"
12:02;12:07;"because powerful corporations don't get the naming rights anymore or like they"
12:07;12:11;"named it after some like hacker legend like who's that guy that the the hackers"
12:11;12:16;"love Aaron Swartz if they named it after some legend I don't know Julian Assange"
12:16;12:22;"arena yeah like that crowdsourced right then I'd be like wow the black chain"
12:22;12:29;"Edward Snowden arena you know just some legends of a legend of leaks or hacks or"
12:29;12:33;"I don't know like or just a joke I mean it'd be pretty lame but you know like"
12:33;12:38;"not this but like Harambe arena again lame but I was gonna say bored ape"
12:38;12:42;"arena would have been even bored a you know would be would be slightly better"
12:42;12:46;"all I'm saying is that yeah you see where I'm going with this that would be"
12:46;12:51;"like wow the blockchain is changing culture it's wild and wacky and like"
12:51;12:57;"hackery and like whatever and decentralized you know but instead it's"
12:57;13:00;"like just the same old thing crypto.com you know what I mean it's like yeah an"
13:00;13:05;"even worse version so again not anti black chain not even anti crypto.com I"
13:05;13:09;"got to talk to Matt Damon to really have an opinion but you know it's just like"
13:09;13:13;"kind of lame but I think we should go even one step further back because this"
13:13;13:18;"really tracks like something culturally before is the Staples Center before was"
13:18;13:24;"even built where did the Lakers play? The Forum. And the Forum had various names"
13:24;13:27;"actually Seinfeld can you look up the forum had a few funny names at some"
13:27;13:31;"point it was called the Great Western Forum from a bank and before that it was"
13:31;13:35;"oh that was from a bank interesting I think so and I think before that it was"
13:35;13:38;"like the fantastic form but I think originally was just the forum man they"
13:38;13:45;"better not off auction off the rights to Dodger Stadium so initially it was named"
13:45;13:52;"after Great Western Savings and Loan as the Great Western Forum then it was"
13:52;13:58;"acquired by Washington Mutual now Chase Bank and it was changed to just the"
13:58;14:04;"forum I mean these companies had restraint back then. Washington"
14:04;14:08;"Mutual dropped some coin on and they said you know what let's be classy we're"
14:08;14:13;"just gonna call it the forum if you know you know if you know if you know you"
14:13;14:18;"know arena Wow who owns if you know you know arena you got to do a little bit of"
14:18;14:21;"digging it's actually Wendy's right it's very cool that they didn't call it"
14:21;14:28;"Wendy's arena oh yeah that is cool I've been meaning to go there but that's"
14:28;14:33;"always been the case right Paramount is a Gulf and Western company you know from"
14:33;14:38;"the beginning. Back then you know mid-century people were more discreet"
14:38;14:43;"and more tasteful it was a zenith of this country and I think it reflects I"
14:43;14:47;"think you could totally write a credible thesis on naming of arenas and the"
14:47;14:51;"decline of America. What's also fun yeah at some point it was called the forum"
14:51;14:58;"which truly actually sounds like Roman and actually totally from the forum to"
14:58;15:02;"Staples Center to crypto.com arena wait but was there anything in between"
15:02;15:08;"Seinfeld? Oh wow well it apparently currently the forum is actually known as"
15:08;15:15;"the forum presented by Chase is the full name of the forum. They just oh god yeah"
15:15;15:19;"I'm not seeing anything kind of in between that seems like it was here is"
15:19;15:25;"the forum Great Western Forum and then back to the forum presented by Chase"
15:25;15:33;"presented by Chase it's classy it's just don't it's it's somewhat classy"
15:33;15:38;"Staples Center was shortened to Staples right like would you say I'm going to"
15:38;15:42;"Staples? No you'd say I'm going to Staples Center. Oh yeah going to Staples"
15:42;15:47;"sounds like you're going to the... No one goes to Staples. I mean that's that"
15:47;15:51;"what's so amazing right I mean. Well yeah by the way what's going on with the"
15:51;15:57;"Staples the company are they in trouble or did they just say you know what maybe"
15:57;16:01;"they knew that they were in a power position and like whoever owns the arena"
16:01;16:07;"came back like guys please don't make it look even if you can come in at half of"
16:07;16:10;"what crypto.com is offering well you can keep it and Staples said you know what"
16:10;16:15;"we just flashed out so much money over the last 22 years and everybody's gonna"
16:15;16:19;"always think of it as Staples Center and now they're in this power position where"
16:19;16:23;"they're like people are gonna be nostalgic for an office supplies store"
16:23;16:29;"they're winning. Nostalgic for an office supplies store. Well I mean and it sounds"
16:29;16:35;"like the press release of a painting exhibition I just did. Staples was paid a"
16:35;16:40;"hundred and sixteen million dollars for 20 years starting in 1999 and then they"
16:40;16:48;"extended the agreement during the Great Recession 2009. So I should also say that"
16:48;16:53;"LA Times has an article about this and it quotes the chief executive of"
16:53;16:58;"crypto.com Chris Marselec as saying that the new name will come to be seen as a"
16:58;17:02;"sign of the times and he has a quote here in the next few years people will"
17:02;17:06;"look back at this moment as the moment when crypto crossed the chasm into the"
17:06;17:12;"mainstream. Marselec said when reached at his home in Hong Kong. This is just a"
17:12;17:15;"brilliant move from the guys at AEG because the next decade belongs to"
17:15;17:21;"crypto he said. He said this is a brilliant move by AEG for accepting my"
17:21;17:26;"700 million dollars. It's kind of weird to be the guy from crypto.com saying"
17:26;17:31;"great move on AEG's part. I just came across an article Paul George who plays"
17:31;17:36;"for the Clippers. He was asked what do you think about the name change and he's"
17:36;17:40;"from LA and he says it'll be weird I grew up with this being Staples and"
17:40;17:44;"Staples being the place to play and the place to be. It'll definitely be weird"
17:44;17:47;"it's the same location but it's kind of like you're stripping the history here"
17:47;17:51;"by calling it something else. From there going forward I guess it's a new history"
17:51;17:55;"to be written. Interesting quote but even then you're now getting somebody to talk"
17:55;17:58;"about an office supply store like Staples being like well that's history"
17:58;18:02;"man. Kind of stripping history. Yeah and he's right a new history is being"
18:02;18:07;"written in 20 years somebody might look back fondly on crypto.com but yeah this"
18:07;18:11;"truly is a milestone."
18:19;18:36;"I got a peaceful, easy feeling, I know you won't let me down."
18:36;18:58;"Cause I'm already staying, all the time."
18:58;19:02;"We're gonna ask Rod about crypto? Are we gonna ask Rod about NFTs?"
19:02;19:06;"I think the first question should at least be about the name change, and if that opens"
19:06;19:09;"up a lot of NFT talk, so be it."
19:09;19:11;"He's probably played the Staples Center, right?"
19:11;19:15;"As I understand it, he's been an LA resident for many years. Well, yeah, let's get into"
19:15;19:18;"it. We can start with all the LA stuff."
19:18;19:24;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
19:24;19:27;"Hey Rod, Jake."
19:27;19:28;"Rod!"
19:28;19:29;"Yeah!"
19:29;19:31;"Hey boys, how are you?"
19:31;19:33;"How's it going? Welcome to the show."
19:33;19:37;"Thank you. Lovely to be on, first time on."
19:37;19:39;"Hopefully not the last, but we're thrilled to have you."
19:39;19:40;"Thank you."
19:40;19:46;"We're huge fans. You're a legend and we're very excited about your new album, Tears of"
19:46;19:52;"Hercules. But the first thing we want to ask you about, you're a longtime LA resident,"
19:52;19:53;"correct?"
19:53;19:55;"Since 1975."
19:55;19:59;"And that's kind of been your home base. I imagine you're all over the place, but that's"
19:59;20:00;"your home base."
20:00;20:01;"Yeah, more or less. Yeah."
20:01;20:07;"So I imagine you've probably been to, performed at the Staples Center before."
20:07;20:09;"Yes. Yes."
20:09;20:11;"Have you heard about the name change?"
20:11;20:17;"No. I've been locked up here for about 18 months. I went back to LA to do Vegas last"
20:17;20:19;"month. Otherwise, I haven't been back there at all."
20:19;20:21;"Oh, okay. You've been in the UK for quarantine."
20:21;20:24;"Yeah, we've been locked down, mate."
20:24;20:28;"The new name of the Staples Center is the Crypto.com Arena."
20:28;20:29;"Is that bad?"
20:29;20:32;"Well, we just wanted to get your reaction to it."
20:32;20:38;"I couldn't give a f***. I don't give a s*** about it."
20:38;20:39;"Well that's probably the right attitude."
20:39;20:44;"It wasn't one of my favorite places to perform anyway. I love the Forum. And I think the"
20:44;20:48;"Forum's been revamped now. It's got a much better sound."
20:48;20:51;"Were you playing concerts at the Forum, like, back in the 70s?"
20:51;20:56;"Yeah, with The Faces, yeah. We used to play the Forum quite regularly. I did it with Tina"
20:56;21:00;"Turner once. She came up and sang when she had her second album out. Yeah, I've done"
21:00;21:06;"it loads of times. I should imagine 20, 30 times. So I've played Madison Square Garden"
21:06;21:10;"about 50 times. So imagine the Forum's up there as well."
21:10;21:11;"50 times?"
21:11;21:17;"Yeah, I've got to check that. I know Elton's done it more than me."
21:17;21:24;"Yeah. Well, one question that I've always wanted to ask you, and I've always been so"
21:24;21:29;"curious about this, is you're one of the greatest rock singers of all time."
21:29;21:31;"Oh, behind yourself."
21:31;21:38;"You're up there. But I've always been interested, is that you're such a great songwriter, and"
21:38;21:45;"yet in your catalog, you have so equally dispersed songs that you've written or co-written, and"
21:45;21:50;"then songs that other people have written. You've done many albums in your series of"
21:50;21:56;"covers. Obviously, you have a great ear for identifying great songwriters. You've covered"
21:56;22:03;"Tom Waits multiple times. So I'm just kind of curious about your relationship to songwriting"
22:03;22:08;"and how that kind of started and when you first kind of like got into it."
22:08;22:13;"Oh, that's a good story, actually. A good question. I'd never put pen to paper while"
22:13;22:19;"I was with all the bands I was with until I joined the Jeff Beck Group. And then Jeff"
22:19;22:25;"said we should start writing our own songs for one of the two Jeff Beck albums. I think"
22:25;22:30;"it was the second one. And Jeff said, guys, can you start writing songs? I said, OK, Ronnie"
22:30;22:34;"and I said, we'll give it a go. And so I went over to Ronnie's house, which was a little"
22:34;22:39;"tiny council house. You know what a council house is? They're houses for the poor."
22:39;22:40;"Like government housing?"
22:40;22:47;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I went over his house and middle of winter, we turned"
22:47;22:51;"on the electric fire, which had three bars. And then his mum came in and said, you can"
22:51;22:58;"only use one because it's expensive. So it was very cold. We had a notepad and a piece"
22:58;23:04;"of paper and a pencil. And we tried to write a Jeff Beck song and nothing came out. And"
23:04;23:09;"then we said, well, let's have a glass of wine. So we had a bottle of wine between the"
23:09;23:15;"two of us and still nothing came out. But that was the first failed attempt at writing"
23:15;23:21;"songs was with Ronnie. We eventually got a song called Around the Plinth, I think it"
23:21;23:26;"was, for the Jeff Beck album, but it was a struggle. Now it's so enjoyable. I mean, I"
23:26;23:32;"really love it. You know, I love the whole way we put albums together. I'm not saying"
23:32;23:36;"everybody should do it this way, but I do mine over the laptop, you know, make alterations"
23:36;23:44;"that way. And it's so, having spent probably, you know, 20 years in studios with no light,"
23:44;23:49;"no sunshine, it's a relief to be able to do it that way. But I enjoy the songwriting process"
23:49;23:54;"now more than I've done in my entire life. The faces used to lock me in a holiday in"
23:54;24:00;"room, you know, a bottle of wine, tape recorder, a bit of paper and they locked the door till"
24:00;24:04;"I got the lyrics because I was lazy."
24:04;24:10;"So you didn't particularly back then want to go spend a lot of time writing songs?"
24:10;24:16;"No, no. In those in the 70s, there was too much shagging and drinking to do, you know?"
24:16;24:17;"Yeah."
24:17;24:20;"Party. Because the places were party band."
24:20;24:26;"But even when you look at your early work, the first couple, you know, solo albums and"
24:26;24:32;"the fact that Maggie Mae, a song that you wrote or co-wrote becomes this like huge hit,"
24:32;24:36;"that didn't make you feel like, wow, there's like really, I'm like the man, I got to keep"
24:36;24:37;"writing my own songs."
24:37;24:41;"Yeah, yeah, I did. And of course, you may know the story that that wasn't supposed to"
24:41;24:43;"be on the album. That song altogether."
24:43;24:44;"But it was a B-side?"
24:44;24:49;"Yeah. We only had eight tracks and the guys from Mercury Records out of Chicago said,"
24:49;24:52;"we need another track. And I said, I'll have a look, see what I've got. And I had this"
24:52;24:58;"unfinished song. It didn't even have a title. And I went and finished it with Ronnie and"
24:58;25:04;"Mack and there came Maggie Mae. And it wasn't for a disc jockey in Cleveland who turned"
25:04;25:09;"it over because Reason to Believe was the A-side. B-side was Maggie, may not be talking"
25:09;25:10;"to you today."
25:10;25:15;"It's amazing that it used to work that way. It was Cleveland that turned the tide?"
25:15;25:19;"D-jockey in Cleveland turned it over. He said, this is good. Let's play this."
25:19;25:24;"We were just talking recently about there was a disc jockey in Cleveland that got Rush's"
25:24;25:25;"career started."
25:25;25:30;"I can't imagine it's the same guy because it's 50 years ago."
25:30;25:32;"It might have been. It was probably early 70s."
25:32;25:36;"Yeah, 1971. It was 50 years ago this month or next month."
25:36;25:37;"Wild."
25:37;25:38;"It was 50 years in March, I think. I'll check that out. But it may be the same guy."
25:38;25:39;"Wake up Maggie, I think I've got something to say to you. It's late September and I"
25:39;25:40;"really should be back at school."
25:40;26:07;"I know I keep you amused, but I feel abused. Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more."
26:07;26:27;"Is it true that in the 70s, like the Midwest was like true rock country? Did you have like"
26:27;26:32;"amazing shows in Ohio and Indiana? Do you have a special connection to that area?"
26:32;26:37;"No, not really. I mean, with the Jeff Beck group, we had a couple of cities. I'm going"
26:37;26:44;"way back now to '69, '68, '69. We had a couple of cities that we favoured. One of them was"
26:44;26:49;"Detroit and the other one was Pittsburgh. It was always a great audience for us. Out"
26:49;26:55;"West, it wasn't so good. I can't remember the places because we were all so drunk at"
26:55;27:04;"the time. We drank too much, that's for sure."
27:04;27:06;"Was your first trip to California with the Faces?"
27:06;27:13;"No, the first trip was with the Jeff Beck group and we supported Pink Floyd at the Anaheim"
27:13;27:19;"Convention Centre. It was our first tour. We support the Grateful Dead, a lot of big"
27:19;27:21;"bands, American bands."
27:21;27:23;"Whoa, you opened for the Grateful Dead?"
27:23;27:27;"Yeah. It was hard for them to follow us on, I tell you."
27:27;27:28;"I bet."
27:28;27:33;"The Americans had never seen anything like this, especially the likes, you know, four"
27:33;27:38;"white boys playing Chicago blues. Especially the way me and Ronnie used to look in those"
27:38;27:46;"days. We had all these cross-belt bottom trousers and pink crosses, enormous hair. You know,"
27:46;27:49;"Americans hadn't seen anything like that in 1969."
27:49;27:54;"My dad has told me that he saw you play opening for Jimi Hendrix."
27:54;27:56;"Oh, that's right. Yeah."
27:56;28:01;"And he said it blew. Yeah, because I grew up with your music. I'm a huge fan. My dad's"
28:01;28:05;"a huge fan. But he would always tell that story that he didn't know who you were. You"
28:05;28:08;"guys opened for Hendrix and just like blew the stage out."
28:08;28:13;"Yeah. No, he followed us on. He was great. And I remember that. You know, millions of"
28:13;28:19;"concerts, you remember one. I remember it because I didn't go and solo to Jimi. You"
28:19;28:24;"know, I had a bit of a cold. Ronnie and Jeff went solo. I met Nicky Hopkins, went to solo"
28:24;28:29;"to him. I go, ""Oh, I feel so awful. I better not. I might give him a cold."" Missed the"
28:29;28:33;"opportunities. He's gone now. So that's how I remember that. Yeah. He was a lot better"
28:33;28:37;"than us. Yeah. Fire coming out of his eyes."
28:37;28:38;"Sounds like a, yeah."
28:38;28:43;"Growing guitars up in the air. And, you know, he was great. Rest in peace, Jimi."
28:43;28:48;"Is it true that the faces would sometimes check into hotels as the Grateful Dead?"
28:48;28:49;"Fleetwood Mac."
28:49;28:50;"Fleetwood Mac?"
28:50;28:51;"Oh, Fleetwood Mac."
28:51;28:52;"Because the faces had been banned?"
28:52;28:57;"Fleetwood Mac weren't known in those days. The Grateful Dead were. Fleetwood Mac hadn't"
28:57;29:02;"broken through. We were, both bands were trying to cut through. So no one knew whether we"
29:02;29:06;"were Fleetwood Mac or the faces. No one really knew."
29:06;29:08;"Is that because the faces had been banned?"
29:08;29:14;"Yeah. Yeah. For, you know, silly behavior. And, you know, the normal thing, we drilled"
29:14;29:18;"through walls because they were only breeze brock. So we used to drill through the walls."
29:18;29:23;"So all the walls, can't believe I'm telling you this. You know, we used to get really"
29:23;29:28;"told off. And the reason we did it, we were so, because the Holiday Inn used to treat"
29:28;29:33;"us so badly, like we were scum. You know what I mean? So that was our way of getting back"
29:33;29:34;"at them."
29:34;29:37;"I saw an interview where you said they wouldn't even bring you room service."
29:37;29:41;"No, no, they just didn't want to. They didn't want to know us. You know, they..."
29:41;29:45;"Just because you were like rock and rollers or was like an anti... they thought you were"
29:45;29:46;"hippies?"
29:46;29:50;"Yeah, we weren't hippies, but it was middle America, mostly, you know, like around Kansas"
29:50;29:53;"and Des Moines."
29:53;29:58;"And so what was your impression of the Grateful Dead and like the San Francisco kind of hippie"
29:58;29:59;"scene?"
29:59;30:04;"It was lovely. It was... lovely is probably the right word, but it didn't affect me and"
30:04;30:09;"Ronnie. We had our own style, you know, we invented our own style. I was talking to someone"
30:09;30:14;"about this yesterday because on the new album, there's a tribute to Mark Bolan. And me and"
30:14;30:19;"Mark were really good friends. You know, we did a show with the faces with him where he"
30:19;30:23;"was top of the bill and we absolutely wiped the floor with him. You know, he was such"
30:23;30:27;"a gentleman. He'd come in and he'd say, I can't follow you guys on. That was so great."
30:27;30:32;"How many acts would do that nowadays? And we remain good friends. But getting back to"
30:32;30:36;"what you said, we all shopped in the same shop. It was called Granny Takes a Trip in"
30:36;30:43;"a King's Road. You know, so you go in there, you go in this shop and I go, oh, I like that"
30:43;30:47;"jacket there. And they go, no, you don't want that. Bowie's got it. You go, what about that"
30:47;30:52;"one? No, Jagger's got that one. It was that close knit, you know. I've forgotten what"
30:52;30:54;"your question was now. I rambled."
30:54;30:58;"Your impressions of the Grateful Dead. We talk about them a lot on the show and it's"
30:58;31:02;"been interesting to us. Such a huge band in the US, but never particularly crossed over"
31:02;31:03;"with English audiences."
31:03;31:08;"I can't tell you why. I mean, I must admit, I wasn't a fan at all because it wasn't like"
31:08;31:13;"the sort of music I like. I like, you know, blue stuff, soul stuff. And their stuff sort"
31:13;31:15;"of rambled on for a few days, didn't it?"
31:15;31:18;"Yeah. Did you interact with them much when you did the show together or you were kind"
31:18;31:19;"of in your own universe?"
31:19;31:20;"Yeah."
31:20;31:21;"Yeah. Fair enough."
31:22;31:29;"I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing."
31:53;32:01;"You won't need too much persuading. I don't mean to sound degrading. But with a face like"
32:01;32:09;"that, you got nothing to laugh about. Red lips, brown fingernails. I hear you, I mean,"
32:09;32:15;"I don't care to fail. Let your boy dance with me, my saddle. Come on. Come on."
32:36;32:41;"So how is it that you ended up settling in California in 1975?"
32:41;32:42;"Well,"
32:42;32:44;"Something must have attracted you to LA."
32:44;32:52;"It was something that pushed me out of the UK. The taxes became, 93% of your money was going to be taken in taxes."
32:52;32:53;"Tax man."
32:53;33:02;"That was 1975. And in those days, everybody left. I think at one point it was Eric Clapton, I think Joe Cocker, me,"
33:02;33:10;"maybe the Bee Gees, a lot of people all went out on April the 5th, the day before the fiscal year, to get away from UK taxes."
33:10;33:17;"They were just diabolical. I mean, can you imagine just taking home 93% of what you earned? It's not fair."
33:17;33:21;"That's a, yeah, I think in the US in the fifties, it was the same too."
33:21;33:22;"Was it really?"
33:22;33:28;"Yeah. And like during the Eisenhower years, it was for the very, very top earners. It was like in the nineties."
33:28;33:32;"And of course, obviously the Beatles wrote that famous song about it too."
33:32;33:33;"Paying for the war."
33:33;33:34;"Yeah. Right."
33:34;33:42;"But so of all the places you could go, so we understand you were leaving the UK, but was California just the most obvious choice to you?"
33:42;33:48;"Oh yeah, because I'd been there before and enjoyed it, enjoyed the company of some beautiful girls."
33:48;33:51;"And of course the sunshine and yeah, why wouldn't I go?"
33:51;33:58;"You know, I've always had like a funny connection in my head between you as an iconic blonde Englishman living in LA,"
33:58;34:04;"with another iconic blonde Englishman living in LA, David Hockney. Did you guys ever hang out?"
34:04;34:10;"No, we don't. Believe it or not, I've got a Hockney somewhere in this house."
34:10;34:11;"Really?"
34:11;34:16;"I went out with one of his best mates from Manchester, a girl called Jenny Rylands."
34:16;34:19;"And he used to live upstairs when we were all unknown."
34:19;34:21;"Oh, so you got some early work."
34:21;34:25;"She came from Manchester as well. And I have a drawing of his somewhere. I've got to try and find it."
34:25;34:29;"Might be worth some money, you know. But I didn't really hang out with him."
34:29;34:30;"But you met him."
34:30;34:31;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
34:31;34:38;"And so there were a lot of English musicians of your generation, probably all moving to LA around the same time, hanging out?"
34:38;34:45;"Yeah, yeah. For the same reason, tax reasons. I think the Bee Gees as well were living in England at that time and they moved out to California."
34:45;34:51;"May be wrong on that one, but there was a mass exodus. Because all of us thought, you know, how long is this going to last?"
34:51;34:58;"I think I'd still be doing this in the 70s. We thought we'd go earn the money while we can, you know, because what we can do for the rest of our lives."
34:58;34:59;"Yeah, of course."
34:59;35:07;"So did you have those conversations with your friends when you were, let's say, in your mid-30s and it's the early 80s or something, or the 70s?"
35:07;35:11;"And you're like, in the year 2000, we'll definitely not be doing this anymore."
35:11;35:17;"I guess, did you have a vision of what you might be doing when you were in your 50s or 60s or 70s?"
35:17;35:18;"No."
35:19;35:28;"No, clearly it was frightening. I was put on this earth to just sing and look at this face. What else could I be but a rock singer?"
35:28;35:34;"What would you tell the 35-year-old Rod Stewart if you could talk to him now?"
35:34;35:42;"My life's been pretty wonderful. I've got no complaints. I had a couple of dodgy business people working for me."
35:42;35:51;"Be careful of who you trust. Be careful. Always keep your eye on the pennies. The pounds look after themselves. Keep your eye on the pennies."
35:51;36:03;"Very good advice. And also, the truth is, when we look backwards at your career, it seems like a more or less unbroken string of successes, which is not true of everybody from your generation."
36:03;36:17;"You had, obviously, the early success in the rock era, but late 70s, still making hits, into the 80s, the new wave era, into the 90s. Is that how it felt at the time?"
36:17;36:27;"Yeah, it did. I think about it and I think, I'm still here and I've been hoping for a top five album tomorrow."
36:27;36:38;"I was hoping it was going to be number one, but I can't compete with, I'm talking about in England, in Great Britain, I can't compete with Adele and Abba and Little Ginger Geezer."
36:38;36:39;"Dead."
36:39;36:48;"Yeah, Little Ginger Geezer. I can't compete with them. Abba haven't released an album in 40 years."
36:48;36:57;"But we're hoping to get in. So I would never have dreamt in a million years I'd still be recording and more importantly, enjoying it so much as I do."
36:57;37:11;"And I love getting up on the stage. I'm a natural show off. Always was before I was singing. I love expressing myself with clothes and humour. Now I can do it with my voice that the good Lord has given me."
37:11;37:13;"Yeah, your voice still sounds great."
37:13;37:15;"It does, doesn't it?"
37:15;37:25;"No, no, no, truly. And I mean, did you do anything? I mean, I know you did a lot of partying. So like, it's always just kind of sounded the same. You never had to sweat it?"
37:25;37:39;"Yeah, like an athlete, you know, as you get older, you've got to look, there are only a couple of muscles bashing together in your throat. You've got to look after them. You've got to warm up for an hour, warm down for 15 minutes."
37:39;37:51;"Can't stay out too late in noisy clubs anymore. You know, it's just because I'm getting older. And you got to look, it's like, it really is like being an athlete. Even when you do, you know, we did 10 concerts in Las Vegas."
37:51;38:04;"It takes a lot of building up to it. You know, you can't, it's like football, you can't just go out and play. You do all the training you want, but you can't just get on the field and start playing. There's a whole different entity. Same with vocalising."
38:04;38:08;"Are you going on tour next year? Are you mostly doing shows in Vegas?"
38:08;38:25;"Yeah, oh yeah. I do it three times a year. Beginning of the year, middle of the year, the end of the year. And in between that, hopefully if all goes well, we'll be going down to New Zealand and Australia. And then we're doing three months in America. And then we'll do Europe and the UK this time next year."
38:25;38:34;"They're actually selling, in fact, a couple of gigs are already sold out. But this time next year, here in England. So, pretty good for an old fella."
38:34;38:36;"That's incredible."
38:37;38:46;"He ended up just home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams. He said somehow, somewhere it's gotta get better than this."
38:46;38:53;"Piled up some bags left him no for a month, she was just seventeen."
38:53;38:58;"There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye."
38:58;39:04;"They held each other tight as they drove them through the night. They were so excited."
39:05;39:09;"We got one shot at life, let's take it while we're still not afraid."
39:09;39:16;"Because life is so free, and time is a thief when you're undecided."
39:16;39:22;"And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands."
39:23;39:45;"Young hearts be free to sit down. Time is on your side. Don't let 'em put you down, don't let 'em push you around. Don't let 'em ever change your point of view."
39:45;39:56;"I have no idea if this is true, but I heard a rumor that you're famously a model train enthusiast and there have been times where you've taken your set on tour. Is that true?"
39:56;39:58;"Yeah, that's very, very true."
39:58;39:59;"Oh, really?"
39:59;40:01;"Yeah, why wouldn't it be?"
40:01;40:03;"What is that you took it on tour?"
40:03;40:10;"It's not on a little motor road, it just goes around in a circle. It's in a building here that's I'd say 45 feet by 30 feet."
40:10;40:19;"And I moved it over from America. It took three months to get in, it's going to take about seven months to get it up, working, and looking amazing."
40:19;40:23;"Look at it online, you won't believe it. You'd think it was the real thing."
40:23;40:25;"Is the part that you've taken it on tour with you true?"
40:25;40:27;"Yes, it's very true, yeah."
40:27;40:29;"So it sounds like it's..."
40:29;40:31;"Let me tell you, let me tell you."
40:31;40:33;"You have to set it up. Break it down for us."
40:33;40:42;"I build a project, say I've got a, you know, in my layout, there's skyscrapers that are five foot tall, in HO scale, to scale."
40:42;40:50;"So I would pack all my cases, paints, carpentry, stool, everything that I need in big cases and take it on tour."
40:50;40:59;"And the hotels would set up a room separately with a dining table, right, for me, especially to continue with my hobby."
40:59;41:07;"It is wonderful, you know, a lot of guys on tour, they stay in bed all day, or they're masturbating or whatever, going out to the theatre."
41:07;41:15;"Well, there's nothing wrong with that either, but it's such a wonderful, a wonderful hobby, three-dimensional hobby, I love it."
41:15;41:16;"I work every day on it."
41:16;41:26;"And so part of like the joy of doing it, it's not merely, because some people just collect, but you like to actually put it together, paint, and really make it."
41:26;41:30;"Build everything, yeah, build everything. Everything, the detail is ridiculous."
41:30;41:38;"I have a couple of girls work for me who just put in blinds in windows, skyscrapers, and there's thousands of them."
41:38;41:41;"And before that, they have to put the windows in, little tiny windows."
41:41;41:43;"There's pictures online of your whole setup?"
41:43;41:45;"Yeah, yeah, look up Mr. Small Railroad."
41:45;41:46;"That the listeners can check out."
41:46;41:47;"Yeah, you'll see it."
41:47;41:50;"Have you traded notes with Neil Young?"
41:50;42:03;"No, you know, Neil is like what you said, my friend, he connects the rails up and he bought a big railroad company, a toy company, what they call it, he bought it for his autistic son."
42:03;42:04;"Lionel?"
42:04;42:05;"Lionel, yeah."
42:05;42:06;"Yeah."
42:06;42:11;"So Lionel is more of a toy-like thing, you don't have to do anything, just put the lines together and run the trains."
42:11;42:15;"It's a big difference between that and scale model railroading."
42:15;42:20;"I have a hot tip for you, if you're ever in Chicago, have you been to the Art Institute of Chicago?"
42:20;42:22;"Oh yeah, the layout there."
42:22;42:27;"Well, in the bottom floor of that museum, there's an incredible display of miniatures."
42:27;42:29;"Yeah, yeah, I have been there."
42:29;42:31;"There's one in New York as well."
42:31;42:32;"Incredible."
42:32;42:33;"Yeah, I've heard about them."
42:33;42:34;"I love Sall Street."
42:34;42:36;"Is it Sall Street?"
42:36;42:38;"S-A-L-L-L-E?"
42:38;42:49;"I don't know what it's called, I forget, it's someone that spent decades making these and they're all on display and they're just the most meticulous recreations of buildings from different historical eras."
42:49;42:50;"Oh God, I've got to see that."
42:50;42:52;"I think you would love it."
42:52;42:53;"What's it called?"
42:53;42:56;"It's at the Art Institute of Chicago."
42:56;42:58;"Art Institute of Chicago."
42:58;43:00;"Yeah, if you went there, it would be in the bottom floor."
43:00;43:02;"Well, I'll look at it online first."
43:02;43:10;"And so, when you're building this, you're not building any city in particular, it's an imaginary city with buildings from all over the world?"
43:10;43:14;"No, no, no, it's purely American railroads."
43:14;43:23;"The turn of the, about just after the war, when steam was being phased out, diesel trains were coming in, and it's a cross between Chicago."
43:23;43:29;"You know, when I'm on tour, I'll take pictures of buildings and say, ""Right, I'm going to try and build something similar to that."""
43:29;43:31;"So it's a cross between New York and Chicago."
43:31;43:34;"It's even got a little rubbish in the streets."
43:34;43:36;"Whoa. And people?"
43:36;43:38;"Oh yeah, thousands of them."
43:38;43:40;"It's kind of like a work of art."
43:40;43:44;"You could say that. Mine is considered up there amongst them."
43:44;43:49;"Get back to me, when you have a look at it, then you'll understand how good it is."
43:49;43:51;"You know, it's hard for me to describe."
43:51;43:52;"Right."
43:52;43:56;"It gives me so much pleasure, and it's such an alternative to what I do for a living, you know."
43:56;43:58;"Right. That's amazing."
43:58;44:02;"Roger Daltrey is also a model railroad man."
44:02;44:04;"Do you know a guy called Jules Holland?"
44:04;44:05;"Oh yeah, of course."
44:05;44:08;"Jules Holland. He's as fanatical as me."
44:08;44:10;"So you guys can trade notes?"
44:10;44:11;"Yeah."
44:11;44:12;"Amazing."
44:12;44:18;"I love these classic rock icons who are into trains. Daltrey, Stewart, Neil Young."
44:18;44:21;"Yeah, Roger is very much into it."
44:21;44:23;"Yeah, it's a wonderful hobby."
44:23;44:26;"Do you go out of your way to ride trains when you travel?"
44:26;44:31;"No, I don't go that far. I don't do train spotting."
44:31;44:38;"So the new album, like we were talking about, you've always had this great knack for writing your own songs, but also choosing well."
44:38;44:43;"The title track, Tears of Hercules, what's the story with the guy who wrote it?"
44:43;44:46;"He's somebody that you've dug into his work before, right?"
44:46;44:51;"Mark Jordan. He wrote a song for me called The Rhythm of My Heart, and we remained friends ever since."
44:51;44:52;"Oh yeah, huge song."
44:52;44:57;"Yeah, and he found that one of his. It's a gorgeous song, and I love the title."
44:57;45:01;"And that's why they said, ""Well, why do you call the album Tears of Hercules? Why not?"""
45:01;45:03;"It sucks you in straight away."
45:03;45:08;"What does he mean by that? I mean grown men who should be able to cry."
45:08;45:12;"I was actually wondering about that because it's a very evocative phrase."
45:12;45:21;"And as I was listening to the lyrics of the song, it seemed like it's about a guy who's kind of walking through a city and kind of reminiscing."
45:21;45:28;"And then he sees somebody that he used to love and says, ""Then I saw your face across the street through the tears of Hercules."""
45:28;45:33;"Your interpretation of that is that it's like a strong man showing emotion."
45:33;45:40;"Yeah. Now, I don't know what, you know, maybe I should ask Steve what he meant by it, but that's how I read it. People ask me."
45:40;45:43;"No, it's cool. And of course, with lyrics, there doesn't have to be an obvious answer."
45:43;45:46;"We just often go really deep talking about lyrics on this show."
45:46;45:49;"I just wondered if maybe there was like a pub called Tears of Hercules."
45:49;45:51;"I just I just curious."
45:51;45:53;"What a great name that would be."
45:53;45:56;"Because English pubs have these crazy names."
45:56;46:00;"Like that wouldn't be that weird to have an English pub called the Tears of Hercules."
46:00;46:03;"Oh, God, I feel like opening a pub now."
46:03;46:05;"That's the best idea I've heard today."
46:05;46:06;"Please do."
46:06;46:13;"Yeah, because I thought maybe the guy's walking down the street and then he looks through the window of the pub, the Tears of Hercules, and he's, I can't believe it's my ex-girlfriend."
46:13;46:15;"Whoa. That's kind of how I interpret it."
46:15;46:17;"Anyway, just whatever."
46:17;46:19;"That's the great. That's the wonderful thing about songs."
46:19;46:21;"You can interpret it any way you wish."
46:21;46:23;"Oh, absolutely."
46:23;46:25;"So it goes."
46:25;46:28;"History shows."
46:28;46:33;"Deserts must expand."
46:33;46:38;"Camels sail like wooden ships."
46:38;46:43;"Like women on the strand."
46:43;46:48;"There's a sand on Second Avenue."
46:48;46:53;"And the wind blows like a train."
46:53;46:58;"Taxis line up like a string of pearls."
46:58;47:05;"Around the block again."
47:05;47:09;"I remember everything."
47:09;47:14;"And every windowpane."
47:14;47:23;"Every word came back to me like I was so lame."
47:23;47:30;"But then I saw your face across the street."
47:30;47:35;"Through the tears of Hercules."
47:35;47:44;"So you've popularized many songs and you've made these very successful songs where you're digging into the American Songbook, things like that."
47:44;47:48;"Yeah, I told you lately that I love you. Van Morrison, First Cut is the deepest."
47:48;47:50;"Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely."
47:50;47:55;"Yeah, I've done many success. I've done, you know, Downtown Train, Tom Waits."
47:55;47:56;"Yeah, I love it."
47:56;47:58;"One of my favorite writers."
47:58;48:00;"Yeah, absolutely. Love Tom Waits."
48:00;48:06;"So has there been much music that, because you have such a great ear for songs,"
48:06;48:11;"have you ever been tempted to record something by a younger artist?"
48:11;48:18;"Or are there any newer songwriters that have kind of like caught your ear at all as you've been looking for songs?"
48:18;48:25;"I like Bob Ezra. I like his voice. I like the way, I like his lyric writing. I like the way he presents himself."
48:25;48:26;"You know Bob Ezra?"
48:26;48:28;"Yeah, I've heard of him."
48:28;48:31;"Underneath the hot sun."
48:31;48:33;"He's English? Yeah, yeah, I've heard of that."
48:33;48:35;"Otherwise, no."
48:35;48:40;"Understandable. Tell me if this line of reasoning, if we've exhausted it, but just back to the songwriting thing."
48:40;48:46;"You have so many peers who, you've written songs as good as anybody of your generation,"
48:46;48:52;"but it seems like there's so many people who get so caught up and competitive about songwriting"
48:52;48:55;"or people want to make an album where they wrote every song themselves."
48:55;49:02;"Are you just like too cool to care? You know, like you've always been, you've never gotten caught up in that game?"
49:02;49:07;"I'm unaware of any game about, you know, you must do all your own songs or else."
49:07;49:12;"I mean, I just, as I always say, I've got such a flexible voice."
49:12;49:17;"I can more or less sing anything, you know, hence the great American songbook."
49:17;49:22;"So, you know, you should record what pleases you, what makes you happy."
49:22;49:28;"You know, I record what I think my fans want and what they want is what I want."
49:28;49:34;"I'm not going to try and, you know, record half-bloody pop songs just because it may be a hit."
49:34;49:37;"You've got to stick by your principles and stick by what you believe."
49:37;49:42;"Absolutely. I know you've talked about this at length many times, including in your book,"
49:42;49:49;"but people often talk about a big moment in your career is with the success of Do You Think I'm Sexy?"
49:49;49:54;"There was also a kind of critical backlash because they couldn't understand why you're doing disco."
49:54;49:58;"I just want to say, having revisited that song quite a bit before the interview,"
49:58;50:02;"I want to say that song still goes very hard. It sounds great."
50:02;50:06;"What do you think was the big reaction to it back then?"
50:06;50:10;"Well, there was a big reaction to all disco music after a while."
50:10;50:14;"I jumped on the bandwagon. I'll be totally square with you. I wanted to make a disco song."
50:14;50:18;"You know, I don't hate disco. I wanted to make a dance record."
50:18;50:22;"I'd just come back from Brazil and I heard this song in my head."
50:22;50:25;"[sings]"
50:25;50:28;"And turned it into a song six months later."
50:28;50:31;"Unfortunately, someone else had already written that song."
50:31;50:34;"So I was done for plagiarism."
50:34;50:37;"It was a song by Ben Jorg."
50:37;50:38;"Right. But so when you..."
50:38;50:40;"I took it to Carnival and I heard it."
50:40;50:43;"You know, I went over it in my brain and I turned it into a song."
50:43;50:47;"And when you found out that you'd subconsciously taken the melody, you just, you said,"
50:47;50:49;"""Oh, no problem."" And you just gave him some publishing?"
50:49;50:52;"Hands up. Take me to prison. Yeah, I wasn't going to try."
50:52;50:54;"I wouldn't qualify."
50:54;50:56;"You know, I think we both agreed."
50:56;50:59;"I said, ""Listen, I'll give you one of my songs on the album."
50:59;51:01;"You can keep all the publishing."
51:01;51:05;"But we're going to give all the publishing of 'Do You Think I'm Sexy' to Unicef."""
51:05;51:07;"And he was great and he agreed."
51:07;51:10;"So every penny from that song was gone to Unicef."
51:10;51:11;"Oh, every penny?"
51:11;51:12;"Yeah."
51:12;51:14;"Oh, wow. I'm sure that's made up quite a bit."
51:27;51:31;"If you like my body and you think I'm sexy"
51:31;51:35;"Come on, sugar, let me know"
51:35;51:40;"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me"
51:40;51:44;"Come on, honey, tell me so, tell me so, baby"
51:44;51:46;"Obviously, that song is a huge hit."
51:46;51:50;"So did the fact that like a handful of kind of critics who wanted you to keep doing"
51:50;51:53;"every picture tells a story type music, did it bother you?"
51:53;51:56;"Or you always just having too much fun to care about that kind of stuff?"
51:56;51:58;"Yeah, it bothered me at the time."
51:58;52:00;"I mean, it wasn't just a few. It was every critic."
52:00;52:03;"Everyone hated it. The public loved it."
52:03;52:06;"But, you know, you still had the critics on your side."
52:06;52:11;"I mean, it was like walking around with a pink lavatory seat over your head."
52:11;52:13;"You know, it was just ridiculous."
52:13;52:17;"People loved it. You know, they absolutely still love it."
52:17;52:21;"We closed the show with it and it just brings back all the music is meant to do that."
52:21;52:25;"It's bringing back the memories of 1979, you know,"
52:25;52:28;"and that's what we're up there to do."
52:28;52:30;"Entertain people, send them all home happy."
52:30;52:34;"The problem I have, and I think everybody has this problem,"
52:34;52:37;"is trying to bring new songs into the act when all they want to hear is"
52:37;52:41;"""Tonight's the night, hot legs, stay with me"" and ""Killing it Georgie"""
52:41;52:43;"and on and on and on. But I try."
52:43;52:46;"I say, ""Lisa, but please give this one a big round of applause."
52:46;52:49;"It's a brand new song and this is what I'm going to say."
52:49;52:52;"And it's called 'One More Time'."""
52:52;52:55;"And they thought, ""God, give it a big round of applause."""
52:55;52:57;"No, that's a great song. And how many..."
52:57;52:59;"So when you're planning like the new show,"
52:59;53:03;"how many songs do you think you can bring in from the new record?"
53:03;53:05;"I'll put two at the most."
53:05;53:06;"Two at the most."
53:06;53:09;"Two at the most, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:09;53:12;"Because it's a huge repertoire of songs."
53:12;53:16;"I mean, I could do three set lists and every song would be known."
53:16;53:17;"Yeah."
53:17;53:20;"It doesn't worry me. I mean, I just like getting up there and singing."
53:20;53:23;"It's been so long. It's been so long off."
53:23;53:25;"Last question, guys."
53:25;53:29;"I have to go and train my football team, my under-10s."
53:29;53:32;"Well, maybe just tell us about that."
53:32;53:36;"I coach an under-10s football team, soccer team at my house here"
53:36;53:39;"because I have an AstroTurf pitch and floodlights."
53:39;53:40;"Oh, cool."
53:40;53:44;"So we got training Wednesday night with the boys playing on Sunday."
53:44;53:45;"It's my life."
53:45;53:49;"And so you're actually like telling them to run drills and pass them."
53:49;53:52;"Yeah, that's what I was doing this morning at 10 o'clock,"
53:52;53:55;"running drills with a medicine ball."
53:55;53:57;"And you've been playing soccer your whole life"
53:57;54:00;"and you're still out there running around with the kids?"
54:00;54:02;"Yeah, I can't play competitively anymore."
54:02;54:03;"Too many injuries."
54:03;54:05;"You know, I've got a knee replacement."
54:05;54:10;"I can still kick the ball, but I can't get into a 50-50 tackle or anything."
54:10;54:11;"So I've got a knee replacement."
54:11;54:12;"OK, you know what?"
54:12;54:15;"I think just to end on the football/soccer note,"
54:15;54:21;"I imagine you being somebody who loves playing football, living in LA,"
54:21;54:24;"a lot of British expats, all sorts of people coming through."
54:24;54:28;"There must have been some legendary football matches in LA."
54:28;54:30;"Can you tell us about any of them?"
54:30;54:33;"We formed an exiles, we were called the Exiles,"
54:33;54:37;"and we're pretty well known around California because we used to win all the cups."
54:37;54:41;"And actually got to the semifinals of the national, US National Cup."
54:41;54:43;"Were there any other musicians in the mix?"
54:43;54:46;"No, I don't think there was."
54:46;54:49;"No, can't think of any, not at that level anyway."
54:49;54:50;"Not Ron Wood?"
54:50;54:54;"Well, he can't kick himself out of bed, let alone a football."
54:54;54:57;"Or Elton John or any of them, no."
54:57;55:01;"I can't think of anybody that was, I'll tell you who's a good player,"
55:01;55:04;"although he's put on a bit of weight now, he's Robbie Williams."
55:04;55:06;"But he's done his back, he can't play anymore."
55:06;55:08;"But he was a really good player."
55:08;55:11;"So you and Robbie Williams may be the only true,"
55:11;55:15;"actually good players in the last 50 years of English music?"
55:15;55:19;"No, I can't think, you know, there's all the bands,"
55:19;55:22;"there's a lot of bands can play, you know, they're all good,"
55:22;55:24;"like Westlife, they're really good."
55:24;55:27;"Boys to Men, they've got some good footballers in there."
55:27;55:29;"Really? Wow."
55:29;55:32;"But on the Exiles, these were people who had played"
55:32;55:35;"like professionally or semi-professionally before?"
55:35;55:38;"We had three players who were actually in the USA team"
55:38;55:40;"at that time playing for us."
55:40;55:41;"Wow, wow."
55:41;55:42;"It was such a great standing."
55:42;55:43;"And then you."
55:43;55:44;"And then me."
55:44;55:45;"Yeah."
55:45;55:48;"It's called the Exiles, the LA Exiles, you look up."
55:48;55:49;"Representing rock and roll."
55:49;55:51;"They've got trains to look up and the LA Exiles."
55:51;55:52;"And the new album Tears of Hercules,"
55:52;55:54;"your 31st album."
55:54;55:56;"Rod, it's been incredible having you on the show."
55:56;56:00;"Can't wait to go catch a show next year when you're on the road."
56:00;56:01;"Yeah."
56:01;56:02;"And congratulations on the new album."
56:02;56:03;"Take well, guys."
56:03;56:05;"Merry Christmas and happy New Year."
56:05;56:06;"Great talking to you."
56:06;56:07;"All right."
56:07;56:08;"Merry Christmas."
56:08;56:09;"Nice meeting you."
56:09;56:10;"Have a good one."
56:10;56:11;"Bye."
57:25;57:27;"Well, what can you say about that?"
57:27;57:28;"Sir Rod."
57:28;57:30;"Sir Rod, you had some great questions in there, Jake."
57:30;57:32;"Well, so did you, bud."
57:32;57:34;"Tears of Hercules."
57:36;57:41;"I'm kind of glad that we started out by asking him about the crypto.com arena"
57:41;57:43;"because that obviously set the tone."
57:43;57:44;"Just who gives a shit?"
57:44;57:45;"Exactly."
57:45;57:46;"I don't give a shit."
57:46;57:49;"Because actually, sometimes I think when somebody comes on the show,"
57:49;57:51;"actually a lot of the questions,"
57:51;57:53;"it's actually more just something I want to talk about with you."
57:53;57:56;"You know, there's some questions that are appropriate to ask the people"
57:56;57:59;"and then there's some that's more just like you and me just talking about music."
57:59;58:02;"Because really, as I prepared for the interview"
58:02;58:04;"and I was just kind of listening to his music,"
58:04;58:06;"it's like, I guess I already knew the answer."
58:06;58:09;"If you're Rod Stewart, you wrote Mandolin Wind."
58:09;58:10;"Beautiful song."
58:10;58:11;"I know that's one of your favorites, Jake."
58:11;58:14;"I wanted to ask him something about Mandolin Wind"
58:14;58:16;"or who he co-wrote Maggie Mae with,"
58:16;58:18;"but it's sort of like I just didn't get the sense."
58:18;58:20;"He'd be like, ""Yeah, I wrote it."""
58:20;58:21;"I read about that a little bit."
58:21;58:24;"The guy that he co-wrote Maggie Mae and You Wear It Well,"
58:24;58:25;"two great songs."
58:25;58:27;"Martin Quintington."
58:27;58:30;"And it kind of seems like, I don't know exactly what happened,"
58:30;58:34;"but that guy apparently left music and moved to a small town in Wales."
58:34;58:38;"And it says on Wikipedia, he like suffered from mental health issues."
58:38;58:40;"I don't know what the story is, but it's like,"
58:40;58:43;"I don't know if we need to say it or any died."
58:43;58:44;"If we just need to say Rod Stewart,"
58:44;58:46;"what's that guy you co-wrote those songs with?"
58:46;58:48;"It sounded like the rest of his life was really weird."
58:48;58:50;"I had that written down."
58:50;58:53;"I had, because I've always wondered about that guy."
58:53;58:57;"And there's a great video on YouTube of them playing"
58:57;58:59;"You Wear It Well on top of the pops."
58:59;59:02;"And it's all like Rod Stewart and Ron Wood,"
59:02;59:06;"like in full 70s peak empire mode."
59:06;59:09;"And then there's this one guy that looks like a librarian"
59:09;59:11;"wearing a sweater who's like strumming."
59:11;59:12;"And that's Martin Quintington?"
59:12;59:13;"And that's Martin."
59:13;59:15;"Yeah. And I was like, ""What is the deal with it?"""
59:15;59:16;"And then, yeah, it says on the Wikipedia page"
59:16;59:18;"that Rod asked him to join the Faces."
59:18;59:19;"And then he was like,"
59:19;59:22;"""I can't hang with this rock and roll lifestyle."""
59:22;59:23;"Right."
59:23;59:24;"Anyway, I wanted to ask him about it,"
59:24;59:25;"but I'm also like,"
59:25;59:27;"it just didn't seem like it would go anywhere."
59:27;59:28;"I don't know."
59:28;59:29;"Or it seems like sad or something."
59:29;59:30;"I don't know."
59:30;59:31;"Yeah. Yeah."
59:31;59:32;"But it is a fascinating story."
59:32;59:36;"Maybe we'll have to do some original research on our end."
59:36;59:38;"But yeah, but also like,"
59:38;59:42;"I do love these stories because I can picture it two ways."
59:42;59:44;"Like either you're somebody who like,"
59:44;59:47;"was like kind of heading somewhere in music"
59:47;59:50;"and then like something derails you,"
59:50;59:51;"a personal issue or something."
59:51;59:53;"And then you go live in a small town"
59:53;59:54;"and then you're just like,"
59:54;59:56;"next thing you know, it's like 20 years later"
59:56;59:58;"and it's like Rod Stewart just touring stadiums"
59:58;01:00:02;"and you're just like, ""Whoa, man, what went wrong?"""
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Or the flip side is actually very cool."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"You're somebody who just enjoys a quiet life."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"You got a farm in Wales and people are like,"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"""Hey man, so what's your deal?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"Do you have like a job?"""
01:00:10;01:00:12;"And you're like, ""Oh, it's funny you should ask."
01:00:12;01:00:14;"I co-wrote 'Maggie Mae' and 'You Wear It Well'"
01:00:14;01:00:16;"in the early seventies."
01:00:16;01:00:21;"And I make minimum 200,000 pounds a year off that."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"And I just chill."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"I take long walks."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"I was never one for the rock and roll lifestyle."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Man, I could have joined the faces, but you know what?"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"It's not bad, huh?"""
01:00:31;01:00:33;"And they're like, ""You know, that is pretty cool."""
01:00:33;01:00:35;"And I guess this question that I kept trying to like"
01:00:35;01:00:36;"get to with him is,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"and I think I already knew the answer is that,"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"so you're this dude, Rod Stewart,"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"you've written hit songs"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"and you've written like deeply moving songs,"
01:00:43;01:00:44;"like ""Mandolin Wind."""
01:00:44;01:00:45;"Like there's this lines in it where it's like,"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"""I felt ashamed."""
01:00:47;01:00:51;"Just like deep emotional music about memory"
01:00:51;01:00:55;"and love and all the classic themes of great music."
01:00:55;01:00:57;"And then you kind of look and you're like,"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"but then this guy just,"
01:00:58;01:01:01;"he would cover all these other songs"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"and he never really wrote more than like"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"two or three songs per album"
01:01:05;01:01:06;"and sometimes barely any."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"You know, like, so yeah, what's the story with that?"
01:01:08;01:01:09;"And I think obviously the story is"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"he didn't give a shit."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"He's cool."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"He didn't feel the need to be like,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"you could picture like another guy."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- A precious artist, right?"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"- Yeah, who would have been like in the mid nineties"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"would have been like,"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"I'm going to make my like harvest moon."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"I'm going to do a back to basics album."
01:01:26;01:01:27;"I'm going to write every song"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"because you know what?"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"It still f*****g bugs me that like the critics s**t on"
01:01:30;01:01:31;"""Do you think I'm sexy?"""
01:01:31;01:01:35;"You want to see like Rod get into his like mandolin mode."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"Here you go."
01:01:36;01:01:41;"10 songs of like pure rootsy Celtic Americana"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"from Rod Stewart."
01:01:42;01:01:43;"I wrote all the f*****g songs."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"Jeff Beck's out here playing guitar."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"But the truth is he doesn't need to."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- He already did it."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Yeah."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"And also I was thinking about that too."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Like that era, he was so prolific."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"He's putting out one solo record"
01:01:54;01:01:57;"and one Faces record a year, you know,"
01:01:57;01:02:00;"between like the late sixties into the mid seventies"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"when his career sort of shifted."
01:02:02;01:02:04;"He's co-writing with people."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"There's other songwriters on the Faces records."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- Yeah."
01:02:08;01:02:09;"- He's a front man."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"I mean, he said so in the interviews,"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"he's like, listen,"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"even before I started singing, I've been a showman."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"So I think maybe he wasn't burdened"
01:02:16;01:02:20;"with this psychology of being an important artist"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"with a capital A."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"- He basically had unbroken decades of success."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"He was having platinum albums in the early 2000s"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"when he was like, you know,"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"covering kind of like show tunes."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- The song book, right."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- And the great American song book."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"So you could imagine him like looking at the Rolling Stones."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"You know, you could picture another person"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"looking at the Rolling Stones,"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"a guy who kind of came from that milieu,"
01:02:42;01:02:43;"but then went a little pop."
01:02:43;01:02:45;"You could picture somebody look at the Stones"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"and be like, they're like a cool rock band, whatever."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"But you can picture Rod Stewart"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"probably looking at the Stones in the early eighties"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"and just be like, tough luck, fellas."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"I'm selling a lot more records than you."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"And you know what?"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"I don't have to split it five ways."
01:02:57;01:02:59;"Like, you know what I mean?"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"- Footloose and fancy free."
01:03:01;01:03:02;"- Just killing it."
01:03:02;01:03:04;"And his eighties work is great too."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Actually, one of the first Rod Stewart songs"
01:03:05;01:03:08;"I really loved is Young Turks."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"One of his like new wave songs."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"And truly, like he said,"
01:03:10;01:03:14;"he's actually, I don't want to gush about him too much"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"and knock it in his motor like,"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"yeah, you know, we talked to him for 35 minutes once."
01:03:18;01:03:20;"You know, he's actually a very humble guy."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"But even with that interview aside,"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"I always got this vibe from him that he is like,"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"he's kind of like, oh, I got a great instrument."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"I was like, look, I got a great voice."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"My hair is pretty good."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"I know how to like work a crowd."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Just like, I love that."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Just like showbiz vibe."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"I did the faces stuff, dropped some disco,"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"got in a new wave."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"You know what?"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"I just sounded good on all these records."
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Thank you."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"Thanks."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"Like, I know."
01:03:44;01:03:47;"I thought maybe at the end about asking him about"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"Forever Young, which is another great,"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"another great eighties number"
01:03:51;01:03:54;"and another subconscious plagiarization."
01:03:54;01:03:56;"I mean, well, Forever Young is such an iconic Bob Dylan song."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"Obviously like it couldn't have been that subconscious."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"I was just curious about the origin of that song."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"You know, but it's funny because it's not exactly a cover."
01:04:05;01:04:09;"It's like he took the lyrical conceit of Bob Dylan's Forever Young."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Totally different music."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"Applied it to a new catchier song."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"I mean, obviously more of like a hit song."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"Yeah."
01:04:16;01:04:17;"I also love that vibe."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"And actually I love the vibe too,"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"of just being like, again,"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"this impression that I have of him of just, yeah,"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"like you said, Jake,"
01:04:24;01:04:27;"footloose and fancy free being like having this big hit disco song."
01:04:27;01:04:30;"And then the guy in Brazil is like, wait, wait, what the f**k?"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"I just dropped a song with that melody."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"And then Raj Sreer is like, f**k, I was just in Brazil."
01:04:36;01:04:38;"Oh, that, oh, f**k."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"My bad, dude."
01:04:39;01:04:40;"Take the money."
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Let's give it to charity."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Whatever."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"I don't give a s**t."
01:04:43;01:04:44;"You know what I mean?"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"Like, I like, what did he say?"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"He just said, guilty as charged."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Yeah, obviously the listeners can't see,"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"but when we were talking to him,"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"he put his arms up, take me to jail."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Guilty as charged."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"Just a great vibe."
01:04:57;01:05:06;"May the good Lord be with you down every road you go"
01:05:06;01:05:15;"And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you fall from home"
01:05:15;01:05:25;"And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true"
01:05:25;01:05:34;"And do unto others as you'd have done to you"
01:05:34;01:05:39;"Be courageous and be brave"
01:05:39;01:05:43;"And in my heart you'll always stay"
01:05:43;01:05:48;"Forever young"
01:05:48;01:05:52;"Forever young"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"I also love, too, the last thing I'll say,"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"and I know, Jake, you love this stuff, too,"
01:05:57;01:06:00;"that his early work, anybody,"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"especially if there's anybody listening"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"who doesn't know that much about his work,"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"go back and listen to Every Picture Tells a Story."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"I mean, that's the epitome of the tasteful palette of the '70s."
01:06:09;01:06:13;"In fact, Jake, when you made the tasteful palette of the '70s playlist,"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"isn't Maggie Mae like track one or something?"
01:06:15;01:06:18;"Doesn't that epitomize the tasteful palette to you?"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"I do remember when we were talking about tasteful palette"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"years ago on the show, I remember saying,"
01:06:23;01:06:26;"Maggie Mae is one of my favorite recordings."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"Right, because you said at that moment"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"you still had the warmth of the '60s,"
01:06:32;01:06:34;"but the recording quality was slightly better,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"but it hadn't turned the corner yet"
01:06:36;01:06:41;"into what you feel to be the kind of dead, sterile, colder stuff."
01:06:41;01:06:46;"Well, yeah, when we listen to a top five from 1981,"
01:06:46;01:06:48;"how depressing that palette is."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"And yeah, if you were a band in 1971,"
01:06:50;01:06:54;"I think you have the highest odds of making a good sounding record."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"Yeah."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Compared to any other era."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"I love that there's this kind of, his early work,"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"whether the songs that he wrote or songs that he chose,"
01:07:03;01:07:07;"his first solo album is called An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down."
01:07:07;01:07:12;"All those early albums, they have this deep kind of sepia tone nostalgia."
01:07:12;01:07:17;"And it's funny, he almost presented himself in those years"
01:07:17;01:07:20;"as a rumpled old raincoat or something."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Just like, ""I'm Rod Stewart."""
01:07:22;01:07:24;"Almost like a man out of time."
01:07:24;01:07:30;"A guy with this deep sentimental nostalgia for the old times."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"But then at the same time, he very easily transitioned"
01:07:33;01:07:37;"into being a '70s sexy fashion icon too."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"Very cutting edge. He's an interesting mix."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"Yeah, I think he's a bit of a chameleon."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"Because I think in the early '70s, that's what was fashionable."
01:07:45;01:07:46;"Right, right, right."
01:07:46;01:07:51;"Rootsy kind of country rock, influenced by the band."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"And Crosby, Stills, and Nash, he was probably like,"
01:07:53;01:07:54;"""Oh yeah, that's a good vibe."""
01:07:54;01:07:57;"Yeah, and I think he and his buddies were into that."
01:07:57;01:07:59;"That's what the faces sounded like."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"That's what those solo records sounded like."
01:08:01;01:08:05;"He definitely moved in a way that's kind of unusual"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"for how successful he was for so many decades."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"He moved with the times."
01:08:09;01:08:13;"You know who I'm kind of realizing might be the Rod Stewart of our day?"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"Anybody want to guess?"
01:08:15;01:08:16;"Solo artist?"
01:08:16;01:08:19;"Solo artist, yeah. Not that ginger bloke."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"I love that."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"Sam Hunt?"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"No."
01:08:23;01:08:24;"I don't know."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"The person I'm thinking of is actually The Weeknd."
01:08:26;01:08:29;"Because, you know, hear me out."
01:08:29;01:08:32;"Because if the early Rod Stewart was kind of like,"
01:08:32;01:08:36;"the critics loved it, and it kind of had this nostalgia"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"that was fashionable, then when The Weeknd first came out,"
01:08:38;01:08:44;"and he was doing the kind of hazy, weird, beach house sampling R&B,"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"and it was like, ""Whoa!"""
01:08:46;01:08:50;"He kind of came out in the same era as Chillwave."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Not that he was a Chillwave artist,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"but it was this era where there was this type of nostalgia"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"for kind of woozy sounds and recontextualized stuff."
01:08:57;01:09:01;"And The Weeknd, those early EPs, critics loved them."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"They were super cool."
01:09:03;01:09:07;"And then he kind of just kept going,"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"and just got bigger and bigger."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"He did that song from Fifty Shades of Grey"
01:09:11;01:09:15;"that was kind of like a throwback orchestral song."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"He's kind of in his New Wave era, just like a pure pop star."
01:09:18;01:09:23;"I could picture him in 30 years, coming on to Time Crisis,"
01:09:23;01:09:26;"Time Crisis Jr., when me and Jake hang it up,"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"and somebody being like, ""Yeah, so when you came out,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"you were kind of seen as almost like this hipster thing."
01:09:31;01:09:34;"It's funny to think that you were this hipster critic thing,"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"and then you went on to be this huge pop star."""
01:09:37;01:09:40;"And The Weeknd's just like, I don't even know who his peers would be,"
01:09:40;01:09:44;"he would just be like, ""Yeah, I mean, my voice sounds great on everything."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"I have a very flexible, durable voice."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Been there, done that with the hipster sh*t."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"I make hits, and I have a great time."
01:09:50;01:09:52;"You think I give a sh*t about that hipster runoff stuff?"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Like, what the f*ck are you talking about?"""
01:09:54;01:09:56;"Just like, ""Yeah, I have a good time."""
01:09:56;01:09:58;"And I bet he probably plays soccer too."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"And he'll probably end up doing a Vegas residency."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Oh yeah, probably a bit sooner."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"Now you can do that much sooner in your career."
01:10:05;01:10:07;"Yeah, you could totally see The Weeknd."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"I mean, obviously we're in this weird end of history phase,"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"where people keep returning to the same things."
01:10:11;01:10:16;"But like in ten years, if The Weeknd dropped an album"
01:10:16;01:10:19;"doing Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett type songs,"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"and that was a huge hit, that would make sense."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"It all makes sense. Totally."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"The Weeknd is our Rod Stewart."

01:11:32;01:11:35;"I wonder if Rod Stewart knows anything about The Weeknd."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"He seems pretty happy just to do his thing."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"Yeah. I don't think so."
01:11:38;01:11:40;"That's also kind of what I figured too."
01:11:40;01:11:43;"I had a feeling too, even just asking him about new artists,"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"the most likely thing is that he's going to be like,"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"""I don't really give a s***."""
01:11:47;01:11:49;"It would have been funny if we were like,"
01:11:49;01:11:52;"""Rod, but do you know what crypto is?"""
01:11:52;01:11:56;"Yeah. That's for the next time."
01:11:56;01:11:59;"Also, it crossed my mind too that we could just make a list"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"and just be like, ""All right, Rod, we're going to name 10 things."
01:12:02;01:12:03;"Do you know what they are?"""
01:12:03;01:12:06;"But that might come across as condescending,"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"but I should be like, ""Guided by voices."""
01:12:08;01:12:09;"No, absolutely not."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"Because I think the truth is you should just be like,"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"""No. What is this, guys?"""
01:12:14;01:12:17;"I thought maybe if there was the right time to be like,"
01:12:17;01:12:19;"""What did you think of punk rock when that came out?"""
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Because he would obviously know."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Yes. That's a good question."
01:12:22;01:12:26;"But even that's probably a question that he's probably answered."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"He'd probably be like, ""Yeah."""
01:12:28;01:12:29;"He probably has a stock answer."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"Yeah. That's what I think."
01:12:31;01:12:33;"Where he's probably like, ""I mean, I could start off like,"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"'Love the energy, but it's just rock and roll.'"""
01:12:36;01:12:38;"That's what so many of those dudes say."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"It's just rock and roll."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"They're just playing punk rock, man."
01:12:41;01:12:43;"[laughs]"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"""Rod, what did you think of Oasis in the '90s?"""
01:12:46;01:12:50;"Oh, yeah. Great group. Fun lads."
01:12:50;01:12:52;"Some really good songs."
01:12:52;01:12:56;"Yeah. Cool. Next question."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"[laughs]"
01:12:58;01:13:02;"Actually, I don't see Rod Stewart covering Wonderwall."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"No."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"He probably could, but anyway,"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"we could go on and on about the legend that is Rod Stewart."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"Jake, you got a pretty tight email."
01:13:12;01:13:15;"You still get the occasional TC email."
01:13:15;01:13:17;"Yeah. Years ago on the show,"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"when people started emailing us,"
01:13:19;01:13:23;"they found my email and would just email me."
01:13:23;01:13:27;"Then Seinfeld started the official TC account."
01:13:27;01:13:29;"But I do get the straight email."
01:13:29;01:13:33;"We got an email from a dude that's been listening."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"He's living in the past."
01:13:35;01:13:38;"He's been listening to the show from episode one,"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"which was in 2015."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"Oh, yeah. It's amazing that people do that."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"That's really weird."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"I can't even imagine what that would be like,"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"but it's not the first time I've heard about somebody doing that."
01:13:49;01:13:52;"We're really getting-- What episode are we on right now?"
01:13:52;01:13:53;"161."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Oh, my God."
01:13:55;01:13:59;"To start Time Crisis from the top is next level."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"It's a huge time commitment."
01:14:01;01:14:04;"Shout out to anybody who does that, because that's deep."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Why don't we just read the email?"
01:14:06;01:14:07;"Jake, you want to read it?"
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Yeah."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
01:14:11;01:14:16;"""Time Crisis crew. I'm a 42-year-old guy living in Memphis, Tennessee."
01:14:16;01:14:20;"I rarely listen to any new music outside of a handful of bands,"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"one of which is VW."""
01:14:21;01:14:22;"Hell, yeah."
01:14:22;01:14:27;"""I actually heard about VW's first album in the nerdiest old guy way possible"
01:14:27;01:14:29;"from an album review on NPR."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"Only got to see them once in concert in Nashville a couple years ago,"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"and it was great."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"About six months ago, I heard about Time Crisis."
01:14:36;01:14:40;"I wasn't sure if it was something I would be interested in,"
01:14:40;01:14:43;"but as I scrolled through the episodes, I saw a lot of mentions of The Grateful Dead."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"As a longtime Deadhead, I was stoked about that."
01:14:46;01:14:49;"I listened to the Bob Weir interview and really liked the show."
01:14:49;01:14:52;"I decided to go back and start on the first episode."
01:14:52;01:14:55;"I usually listen to about two or three episodes per week."""
01:14:55;01:14:58;"So he's doing four to six hours a week, folks."
01:14:58;01:15:04;"It's crazy to hear you guys talking about things that you don't know about yet,"
01:15:04;01:15:08;"especially when you guys thought Trump even entering the presidential race was a joke."
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Oops."
01:15:09;01:15:13;"I'm going to scream, ""It's not a joke, guys. He's going to win."""
01:15:13;01:15:18;"I'm on about episode 60 right now, so you guys are completely clueless"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"that three years away is COVID."
01:15:20;01:15:24;"""I'm about the same age as Jake, and we have very similar tastes in music."
01:15:24;01:15:28;"I think, like Jake, if it wasn't for Time Crisis and maybe Uber rides,"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"we would not hear any of the music from the top five."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"But I did want to get your take on something."
01:15:34;01:15:39;"When you guys do comparisons with the top fives from the '60s, '70s, and even '80s,"
01:15:39;01:15:42;"I know probably 90% of the songs."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"Do you guys think that 30, 40, 50 years from now,"
01:15:45;01:15:49;"people will still know all the top five songs from this era?"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"The Chainsmokers, Ed Sheeran, etc.?"
01:15:51;01:15:53;"My guess, no way."""
01:15:53;01:15:55;"I disagree, but yeah."
01:15:55;01:15:56;"You disagree?"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"I think people will still--"
01:15:58;01:16:03;"I mean, when songs are hits, they usually have a better chance of lasting."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"I mean, we're going to remember some music from this era,"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"or maybe we won't. I don't know."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"I can't tell."
01:16:08;01:16:12;"I mean, lately, I used to always kind of take the point of view,"
01:16:12;01:16:15;"""We celebrate this music from the '60s. It's important."""
01:16:15;01:16:19;"But again, that's because we grew up in the '90s,"
01:16:19;01:16:24;"so that was like 30 years earlier, and it held this kind of importance."
01:16:24;01:16:27;"But as time goes on, people will look back to different eras,"
01:16:27;01:16:28;"and that partially happened."
01:16:28;01:16:32;"In the 2000s, I think the '80s took on more significance."
01:16:32;01:16:35;"In the '90s, they were kind of looked down on."
01:16:35;01:16:38;"And then suddenly people are like, ""No, the '80s is actually"
01:16:38;01:16:41;"almost as important as the '60s in terms of new ideas"
01:16:41;01:16:45;"and important artists and new archetypes."""
01:16:45;01:16:47;"So I can see it both ways."
01:16:47;01:16:51;"But I will say as I get older and I watch more come and go,"
01:16:51;01:16:55;"I do think there is something uniquely durable about the '60s."
01:16:55;01:17:00;"Maybe it's because we've seen how the '60s artists"
01:17:00;01:17:03;"didn't really get replaced by anybody from the '90s."
01:17:03;01:17:07;"The Rolling Stones are a bigger touring act"
01:17:07;01:17:11;"than basically any band from the '90s or the 2000s."
01:17:11;01:17:14;"And the cultural hold of the Beatles,"
01:17:14;01:17:19;"I went to a screening of a preview of that Get Back, by the way."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"- Oh, cool. I'm very psyched to see that."
01:17:21;01:17:25;"- It's so deep to see them in the studio and just horsing around."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"It's pretty wild."
01:17:27;01:17:32;"But even just watching that, there's just something about the Beatles still--"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"It does seem like the Beatles will always have this kind of stranglehold"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"that'll never go away, which maybe seems obvious."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"And people are like, ""Yeah, no, s*** the Beatles."""
01:17:41;01:17:44;"But again, picture Rod Stewart in the mid-'70s being like,"
01:17:44;01:17:47;"""S***, I got to make some money because who the f*** knows where I'm going to be."""
01:17:47;01:17:51;"He's probably thinking, ""Imagine the year 1992. Jesus Christ."
01:17:51;01:17:55;"I could be a f***ing bum on the street of--"""
01:17:55;01:17:58;"- I'm going to be coaching football at a community college."
01:17:58;01:18:00;"- On Mars."
01:18:00;01:18:02;"[laughter]"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"- ""1992? Can you imagine?"""
01:18:05;01:18:07;"- 1992, God."
01:18:07;01:18:11;"Yeah, I'll probably be on a spaceship singing with a jazz band."
01:18:11;01:18:14;"But anyway, yeah, it was hard to picture what might exist."
01:18:14;01:18:17;"So you could also imagine that in the '90s, people were like,"
01:18:17;01:18:21;"""Mom and Dad, you guys have the Beatles. We have Oasis and Blur."""
01:18:21;01:18:23;"- What's the difference?"
01:18:23;01:18:28;"- ""And our kids, they'll have Oasis and Blur will be their The Beatles."
01:18:28;01:18:33;"And then a as-yet-unknown band will be their Oasis."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"And so it goes."""
01:18:35;01:18:38;"You know, like it wouldn't be crazy that somebody might think that."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"- I think a lot of people assume that."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- That generation does have a stranglehold."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"They outlasted the pretenders to the throne."
01:18:45;01:18:48;"Which is not to say that nobody had success or anything,"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"but it's not linear or something."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"It's not like they got bumped down a few pegs,"
01:18:52;01:18:58;"and then we got Nirvana and Mudhoney or whatever."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"Like, truly, those bands loom large."
01:19:02;01:19:06;"So anyway, that's all to say that I don't think it's that crazy to imagine"
01:19:06;01:19:13;"that there might be songs from the '70s that still cast a longer shadow"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"than stuff from the past 10 years."
01:19:15;01:19:18;"Of course, there's always going to be generational nostalgia,"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"but we're just entering this weird phase."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"I don't know how to describe it."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"I guess all I'm saying is we just don't know."
01:19:24;01:19:28;"- There's a lyric--I'm going to quote my own lyrics."
01:19:28;01:19:32;"There's a lyric on the latest Mountain Brews EP that goes,"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"""The '70s, '80s, and '90s, they came to an end."
01:19:35;01:19:39;"For 20 years it's been a blur, sliding downhill, my friend."""
01:19:39;01:19:41;"Now, that could apply to a lot of things,"
01:19:41;01:19:44;"but I think it definitely applies to the conversation we're having now."
01:19:44;01:19:47;"And I think a lot of it has to do with--we've talked about this."
01:19:47;01:19:49;"This is classic TC."
01:19:49;01:19:52;"In the '60s and '70s, the art form was new."
01:19:52;01:19:54;"It was a fresh art form."
01:19:54;01:20:00;"A lot of the basic big ideas that have been regurgitated in rock"
01:20:00;01:20:06;"the last 40 years were explored between the late '50s and the late '70s."
01:20:06;01:20:11;"From Elvis to punk, that 20-year run,"
01:20:11;01:20:14;"most of the idea--in terms of rock music,"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"most of the ideas that we are still contending with"
01:20:17;01:20:20;"were explored first then in that 20-year run."
01:20:20;01:20:23;"And after that, yeah, it's going to be diminishing returns."
01:20:23;01:20:26;"Honestly, even when you get to dance music and hip-hop,"
01:20:26;01:20:31;"you can make a pretty strong case for some significant ideas"
01:20:31;01:20:34;"being established by the '90s."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"It doesn't mean that there's actually nothing new under the sun,"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"but it just means that that era will always have this type of--"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"it's going to loom large."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"Mm-hmm. The empire."
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Yep."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"Hi to the empire."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Anyway, back to the email."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"The other thing I love about the show is that Jake is honest"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"with his opinions of this new music,"
01:20:52;01:20:56;"and nearly 100% of the time I agree with him when he says something sucks."
01:20:56;01:20:59;"You know, I think I used to be--because he's listening to older episodes--"
01:20:59;01:21:02;"I think I used to be a little more dismissive and harsh."
01:21:02;01:21:06;"I think I'm a little too old for that."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I really wish I was in the studio with you guys"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"so I could hear Ezra's real opinion when the mics are off"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"because he never says anything sucks."
01:21:13;01:21:16;"But as a music industry professional, he's probably scared"
01:21:16;01:21:20;"he will run into one of those guys at a music industry professional event."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Understandable."
01:21:22;01:21:24;"Thanks for understanding."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"I feel like you've become a little more candid, maybe."
01:21:26;01:21:28;"Yeah, maybe a touch more."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Yeah, I think you have."
01:21:30;01:21:33;"Also, I know Jake is a big fan of corporations."
01:21:33;01:21:35;"[laughs]"
01:21:35;01:21:37;"That is a very oblique, weird statement,"
01:21:37;01:21:40;"but let's just take that for what it is."
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Jake's a fan of corporations."
01:21:42;01:21:43;"[laughs]"
01:21:43;01:21:44;"Large and small."
01:21:44;01:21:46;"I've always worked at small companies,"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"but for the last 10 years, I've worked as an executive"
01:21:48;01:21:52;"at a large, publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:21:52;01:21:53;"That's a big shot."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Yeah."
01:21:54;01:21:56;"That sounds like a big deal."
01:21:56;01:21:59;"Executive at a large, publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"I wonder where he works."
01:22:01;01:22:04;"I thought it was going to be terrible when I started it,"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"but it has actually been great."
01:22:06;01:22:09;"At the end of the day, even the largest companies are comprised of people."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"And if the majority of the people are good people,"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"it ends up being a great place to work."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Well, that's heartwarming,"
01:22:15;01:22:19;"considering we are being broadcast on one of the largest corporations' platforms."
01:22:19;01:22:21;"Yeah, but the only thing--"
01:22:21;01:22:24;"Apple is definitely a publicly traded Fortune 500 company."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"I guess the only question is, are we--"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"This could be a psy-op."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"Are we executives?"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"Technically speaking--"
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Wait, Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch,"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"or are me and Jake technically Apple executives?"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"Now, let's get a number crunch."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"Number crunch brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
01:22:43;01:22:45;"Yeah, you definitely are in the C-suite."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"You're Apple executives via Time Crisis,"
01:22:48;01:22:52;"and I congratulate you on years of executive service."
01:22:52;01:22:54;"Because we're president and vice president of Time Crisis,"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"which is an Apple company."
01:22:57;01:22:59;"So, all right."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"But also, I feel this point, too."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Increasingly, as I've gotten older, too,"
01:23:03;01:23:05;"I've kind of felt like the--"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"You can't put the genie back in the bottle."
01:23:07;01:23:09;"You can't put the genie in the same river twice."
01:23:09;01:23:11;"The world changes."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"It's not hard to make a case that it's changing for the worse."
01:23:14;01:23:17;"Of course, I'm sympathetic to that interpretation"
01:23:17;01:23:20;"of the flow of history and culture."
01:23:20;01:23:23;"But truly, whenever you get dropped into history,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"certainly the last--"
01:23:25;01:23:28;"Let's say the last few thousand years of human history,"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"there's going to be all sorts of weird things"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"and things seemingly trending in the wrong direction"
01:23:32;01:23:35;"and some weird mix of living in a golden age"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"and also a dark age."
01:23:36;01:23:37;"And I think he's right."
01:23:37;01:23:39;"It's an important skill to have"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"to be able to look around and say, ""You know what?"
01:23:42;01:23:45;"I may be under some nasty fluorescent lights."
01:23:45;01:23:51;"I may be in some weird kind of soul-crushing environment."""
01:23:51;01:23:53;"And yet, never forget,"
01:23:53;01:23:55;"as long as you're around other human beings,"
01:23:55;01:23:58;"there is something you can unlock in yourself"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"that is, you know, whatever."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"I guess you call your humanity."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"And be like, ""You know what? It's all good."""
01:24:03;01:24:05;"You know, I always think we've all been in these positions,"
01:24:05;01:24:06;"like being at an airport."
01:24:06;01:24:09;"Like, what's worse than a big airport?"
01:24:09;01:24:13;"Truly, that's the epitome of just kind of soulless,"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"modern life sucking."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"And yet, if you're with a group of people,"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"just smells weird,"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"sitting in a nasty chair by the gate."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"But if you're with a bunch of people that you like,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"your family, friends, whatever, you have a laugh,"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"it goes by in a flash."
01:24:28;01:24:29;"It's people, folks."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"Plus, you're like, ""I'm enduring this airport hang,"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"but I'm going to be like 3,000 miles away in like six hours."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"How crazy is that?"""
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Yeah."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"I definitely do that."
01:24:38;01:24:39;"Focus on the positives."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"That you focus on the positive."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Yeah. Well, I definitely am like,"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"I hate traveling and I hate airplanes,"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"but man, when you get to the other end,"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"it is worth it."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"That's right."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Very basic statement."
01:24:50;01:24:51;"That's beautiful."
01:24:51;01:24:52;"Let's finish this email."
01:24:52;01:24:53;"Finally, you may find this interesting."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"Air travel and people."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"Anybody out there who thinks life is meaningless,"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"just remember, air travel and people."
01:24:58;01:24:59;"That's all we're going to say."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Technology and humanity."
01:25:00;01:25:01;"Right, guys?"
01:25:01;01:25:02;"Hell yeah."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Finally, you might find this interesting."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"I have an internal only podcast for our sales team."
01:25:07;01:25:10;"And we are in the roofing industry."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"And at the end of each episode,"
01:25:11;01:25:14;"I play a song with the word roof in it."
01:25:14;01:25:16;"And the very first episode we listened to,"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Mansard Roof."
01:25:17;01:25:21;"Man, this guy really buried the lead, man."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"Yeah."
01:25:22;01:25:26;"You have an internal only podcast for your sales team"
01:25:26;01:25:29;"at a Fortune 500 roofing industry company?"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Yeah, what?"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"First of all,"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"roofing,"
01:25:32;01:25:34;"I'm surprised there's a roofing industry company"
01:25:34;01:25:35;"that's in the Fortune 500."
01:25:35;01:25:36;"It must be like a,"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"it must sell shingles."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"It must be some giant,"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"yeah, or it's just like such a giant company."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"Wait, I think I got it."
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Yeah."
01:25:42;01:25:43;"I think I found it."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Well, don't dox him."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"Should I dox this guy?"
01:25:45;01:25:46;"Wait, wait, don't dox this guy."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"I won't dox him."
01:25:48;01:25:52;"But there is a publicly traded Fortune 500 roofing company"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"that exists."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"Straight up roofing?"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"It has roofing in the name."
01:25:56;01:25:57;"That's all I'm going to say."
01:25:57;01:25:58;"We're not going to dox you."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Is there roofing?"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"If you're watching this,"
01:26:00;01:26:01;"when you hear this episode,"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"know that you weren't doxed."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"Is it roofing supplies?"
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Or is it actually like,"
01:26:04;01:26:05;"we,"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"the offering the services of roofing?"
01:26:07;01:26:08;"Like we will go to your house and,"
01:26:08;01:26:09;"okay."
01:26:09;01:26:10;"I don't want to blow this guy's,"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"I really just assumed it would be like,"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"a division of whatever."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"Yeah, like maybe these guys like,"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"well, actually, yeah,"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"the company is Disney."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Wait, Disney has a roofing division?"
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Oh yeah."
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Yeah, man."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"Have you ever been to Disney world?"
01:26:24;01:26:28;"You know how many roofs they have to build globally per annum?"
01:26:28;01:26:29;"Oh yeah."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"Cruise liners have roofs too."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"Never thought about that."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"That's right."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"I mean,"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Walt Disney actually personally started the roofing division"
01:26:36;01:26:40;"because when Disneyland was built in the fifties,"
01:26:40;01:26:41;"I mean,"
01:26:41;01:26:44;"the suburban explosion in Orange County was incredible at that point."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"And he saw an opportunity."
01:26:46;01:26:49;"He had a Disney sticker on it."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Oh, and by the way,"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"you know who builds roofs for Netflix?"
01:26:53;01:26:54;"It's Disney."
01:26:54;01:26:56;"You think Disney gives a shit about the streaming wars?"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"It doesn't matter who wins."
01:26:57;01:26:59;"They're building the roofs."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"Oh my God."
01:27:00;01:27:01;"I didn't realize that."
01:27:01;01:27:02;"Well, what?"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"You think they made all that money off cartoons?"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"Dumbass."
01:27:04;01:27:06;"All right, man."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"I get it."
01:27:07;01:27:11;"I see a mansard roof through the trees."
01:27:11;01:27:18;"I see a salty message written in the eaves."
01:27:18;01:27:21;"The ground beneath my feet,"
01:27:21;01:27:24;"the odd garbage and concrete."
01:27:24;01:27:37;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too."
01:27:37;01:27:43;"I see a mansard roof through the trees."
01:27:43;01:27:48;"I see a salty message written in the eaves."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"The ground beneath my feet,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"the odd garbage and concrete."
01:27:53;01:27:58;"Now the tops of buildings, I can see them too."
01:27:58;01:28:02;"But also, this idea of an internal only podcast for our sales team,"
01:28:02;01:28:07;"that's like, how many people could possibly be at the sales team of a,"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"I guess it's a big company?"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"A hundred?"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"Thousands?"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"A couple hundred?"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Two hundred?"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"I feel like probably under a thousand."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"I mean, I guess that's just like, that's the, you know,"
01:28:15;01:28:20;"back in the day people used to make like a newsletter for like a tiny company."
01:28:20;01:28:22;"Or it's almost just like doing like college radio."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Yeah, we got about 11 people listening."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"All right."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"That's the audience."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"It's 11 people."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Cool."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Call in."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"You know how like record collectors,"
01:28:31;01:28:35;"especially in the 21st century have gotten really into digging into the past"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"for private press recordings."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Yeah."
01:28:38;01:28:42;"Like Jake, you've gotten into some like the private press new age music."
01:28:42;01:28:43;"Oh yeah."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"I love hitting the bins in SoCal."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"There's so many weird."
01:28:47;01:28:49;"Self-release."
01:28:49;01:28:50;"Yeah."
01:28:50;01:28:54;"Self-release private press new age records that were put out in California"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"in the seventies and early eighties."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"Maybe in the future it'll be like this thing where I guess you'd have to be a"
01:28:59;01:29:01;"historian or just like a podcast obsessive."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"This being like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"Everybody's listening to Joe Rogan or whatever."
01:29:06;01:29:10;"But like I actually have like very particular tastes and I scour the internet"
01:29:10;01:29:13;"trying to find internal only podcasts."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"And it's like, it's actually so amazing."
01:29:15;01:29:19;"You just throw that on in your pod and just vibe out."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"It's literally, it's like you're there in 2021."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Like I found this one, it was so weird."
01:29:23;01:29:28;"It was for the sales team of a roofing company and they made a podcast for it."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"And you know, I was listening to that."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"It's like, whoa, blast from the past, man."
01:29:31;01:29:32;"It's like, you're there."
01:29:32;01:29:33;"It's crazy."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Yeah."
01:29:34;01:29:37;"There's like a Reddit forum with like the passwords to like all of these like"
01:29:37;01:29:41;"weird internal corporate podcasts."
01:29:41;01:29:42;"Somehow."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"I don't even know how to tie that to NFTs, but I'm sure there's,"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"there's a way."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"All right."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"Let's get into the top five."
01:29:49;01:29:56;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:29:56;01:29:59;"We're doing 1969 versus 2021."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"Why 1969?"
01:30:01;01:30:06;"Because that's the year that Rod Stewart dropped his first solo album."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"The number five song."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"I'm curious."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"I don't, I don't know this artist."
01:30:11;01:30:14;"The Flying Machine with Smile, A Little Smile for Me."
01:30:14;01:30:16;"Oh, I love this song."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"I wonder if I'll recognize it."
01:30:18;01:30:21;"Oh, it's a weird version."
01:30:21;01:30:23;"Oh, really?"
01:30:23;01:30:25;"Yeah."
01:30:25;01:30:27;"It's a weird re-record."
01:30:27;01:30:29;"Jake's got a real ear for those re-records."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Oh yeah."
01:30:30;01:30:33;"Well, I was trying to get into my Once Upon a Time in Hollywood mindset."
01:30:33;01:30:38;"Because it's the perfect kind of song that could have been innocuously in the"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"background of one of those scenes."
01:30:40;01:30:44;"And I was like, ooh, that's, here we go."
01:30:44;01:30:45;"Yeah."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"Ooh, it's slower."
01:30:46;01:30:50;"I love that ear jig."
01:30:50;01:30:55;"The Flying Machine, we're from rugby in England."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"This sounds weird too, but whatever."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"Is this a cover?"
01:30:59;01:31:03;"Apparently there are like 10 versions of this song on Apple Music and under"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"labeled."
01:31:06;01:31:12;"Yeah, this is not the definitive version either, but that's okay."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"They keep getting slower."
01:31:14;01:31:16;"This has more 60s."
01:31:16;01:31:30;"This is slowed down."
01:31:30;01:31:32;"This is not the definitive version?"
01:31:32;01:31:34;"God, did someone dose my coffee?"
01:31:34;01:31:38;"I'm like, what is happening?"
01:31:38;01:31:41;"Like every version has gotten slower and in a lower key."
01:31:41;01:31:43;"Right."
01:31:43;01:31:56;"Classic kind of 60s, unique woman's name."
01:31:56;01:31:59;"Smile, little smile for me, Rosemary."
01:31:59;01:32:02;"It's kind of also like, just walk away, Renee."
01:32:02;01:32:03;"Yeah."
01:32:03;01:32:04;"All right."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"I get the idea."
01:32:06;01:32:08;"Weird how slow that is."
01:32:08;01:32:11;"Number five song in our era, 2021."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"Summer Walker and SZA with No Love."
01:32:14;01:32:17;"This is from Summer Walker's sophomore album, Still Over It."
01:32:18;01:32:21;"Oh, yeah."
01:32:25;01:32:30;"Yeah."
01:32:30;01:32:37;"If I had to bet, I wouldn't have did all that."
01:32:37;01:32:40;"I would have played it just how you wanted to play it."
01:32:40;01:32:44;"You didn't yet see my worth, so you try to play me."
01:32:44;01:32:48;"But I was so in love."
01:32:48;01:32:54;"That I just got a little bit too complicated."
01:32:54;01:32:59;"But if I had you back, all I want to do is get drunk."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"Take two."
01:33:02;01:33:07;"All I want to do is get drunk."
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Hot pants."
01:33:09;01:33:13;"So this song is about all lust, no love."
01:33:13;01:33:15;"All right."
01:33:15;01:33:20;"So it's a, if I had you back, we would just have sex, no love."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Straightforward."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Song's called No Love."
01:33:23;01:33:26;"You like break up with someone, and then you start hooking up with them,"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"like a few months after the breakup."
01:33:28;01:33:29;"That kind of scenario."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"That's kind of how it sounds."
01:33:31;01:33:34;"But this is almost like just imagining that scenario."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"If we got back together."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"No, I guess we would never get back together."
01:33:38;01:33:41;"At most, we would just get together and have sex again."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"I mean, in a weird way, it is a nice comparison."
01:33:44;01:33:47;"In a weird way, it is a nice companion piece to One More Time."
01:33:47;01:33:50;"Right, because One More Time does seem about like having sex one more time."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Yeah."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"The sex was immense."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"Maybe we just got to throw on One More Time real quick."
01:33:55;01:33:56;"Because we've been talking about it."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"We've been hearing a little bit about it."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"But we haven't done a breakdown of it."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"This is very highly unusual, but I might skip a few songs."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"Yeah, we could."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"Yeah."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"Guys, I actually got to roll."
01:34:07;01:34:09;"I have my first meeting of the day in two minutes."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"So see you guys."
01:34:11;01:34:12;"All right, Seinfeld."
01:34:12;01:34:14;"We're going to come back One More Time."
01:34:14;01:34:22;"This starts off."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"Yeah, it starts out really good."
01:34:24;01:34:28;"It's very similar to the Bob Dylan song, Mama, You've Been on My Mind,"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"that he covered."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Yeah."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"Then that like Mumford and Sons drum kicks in."
01:34:40;01:34:42;"That's going to be at Rockin' With My Good Old Country Band."
01:34:42;01:34:47;"Then it goes real poppy."
01:34:47;01:34:48;"Smash it."
01:34:48;01:34:49;"Oh yeah."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"There's just one more thing to do."
01:34:51;01:34:53;"Oh yeah."
01:34:53;01:34:57;"I know that I can keep a secret, baby, can you too?"
01:34:57;01:35:02;"One more time, baby, one more time, baby, one more time,"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"just for old time's sake."
01:35:04;01:35:10;"One more time, baby, one more time, baby, one more time,"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"just for old time's sake."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"Yeah."
01:35:16;01:35:19;"Now if we have to separate and find somebody new,"
01:35:19;01:35:23;"it's hard to imagine somebody else with you."
01:35:23;01:35:27;"You taught me how to nasty in those naughty high heel shoes."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"The devil wears Prada."
01:35:31;01:35:34;"We were lovers for a while, but it all came crashing down."
01:35:34;01:35:38;"The sex was immense, but good old country now."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"OK, wait, pause it for a second."
01:35:40;01:35:42;"That is my favorite line."
01:35:42;01:35:43;"That's great."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"There's so many lines in this that I like."
01:35:45;01:35:49;"I do think he could have done a version of this that was basically"
01:35:49;01:35:53;"on some Every Picture Tells a Story vibe."
01:35:53;01:35:55;"But it is interesting."
01:35:55;01:35:58;"Even through all these eras, there is a classic type of Rod Stewart"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"song that has just that hint of Celticness."
01:36:01;01:36:05;"He grew up in London, but famously his family is Scottish,"
01:36:05;01:36:10;"and he feels very tied to Scottish culture and that stuff."
01:36:10;01:36:15;"He does have that kind of nice, rhythm of my heart kind of vibe,"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"and you definitely feel it here."
01:36:17;01:36:20;"But I'm not sure when this is taking place,"
01:36:20;01:36:24;"but I guess he basically is saying, in that kind of charming way that"
01:36:24;01:36:27;"only Rod Stewart can do, I think basically he's like,"
01:36:27;01:36:30;"we had a great relationship, the sex was fantastic,"
01:36:30;01:36:34;"family doesn't like me, and whatever, this was never going to last anyway."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"It was great while it lasted."
01:36:35;01:36:37;"Together we smashed it."
01:36:37;01:36:39;"So there's only one thing left to do."
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I can keep a secret, baby, how about you?"
01:36:41;01:36:45;"I mean, the secret part kind of implies that maybe they're both married now,"
01:36:45;01:36:49;"where he's just kind of like, they did move on, and he's just like,"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"it's a little bit unclear when it's taking place."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Maybe they broke up a few months earlier."
01:36:54;01:36:57;"I think it's years later, and they've run into each other"
01:36:57;01:37:01;"in the lobby of a hotel."
01:37:01;01:37:06;"And it's truly like, whoa, this is a unique little window here."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"And Rod just looks at her and is like, I can keep a secret, baby,"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"how about you?"
01:37:10;01:37:15;"One more time."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"One more time for old times' sake."
01:37:17;01:37:20;"For old times' sake."
01:37:20;01:37:24;"I love how straightforward it is for old times' sake."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"I mean, that's the definition of old times' sake,"
01:37:26;01:37:29;"is you do something that doesn't really fit in anymore,"
01:37:29;01:37:33;"but you're doing it just because it's something you used to do."
01:37:33;01:37:34;"Let's keep listening."
01:37:34;01:37:37;"You'll always be on the speed dial."
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Speed dial."
01:37:38;01:37:39;"You'll always be on speed dial."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"It was great while it lasted."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:37:43;01:37:46;"And together we smashed it."
01:37:46;01:37:50;"There's only one more thing to do."
01:37:50;01:37:55;"I know that I can keep a secret, baby, can you too?"
01:37:55;01:38:00;"One more time, baby, one more time, baby, one more time,"
01:38:00;01:38:02;"just for old times' sake."
01:38:02;01:38:04;"You got fiddle coming in?"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"Yeah."
01:38:05;01:38:09;"There's some really tasteful playing on this."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Just for old times' sake."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"Just one more time."
01:38:13;01:38:15;"One more time."
01:38:15;01:38:16;"For the old times' sake."
01:38:16;01:38:17;"There's someone else."
01:38:17;01:38:18;"One more time."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"I know, I can't."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Just for old times' sake."
01:38:22;01:38:24;"I really shouldn't."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"Don't leave me like this."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"One more time."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"I'll never forget you, baby."
01:38:30;01:38:34;"I gotta say, like, it really just feels like authentically Rod."
01:38:34;01:38:37;"Like, obviously the synths sound nothing like the early music,"
01:38:37;01:38:42;"but I do feel like the character in this song just feels like pure Rod."
01:38:42;01:38:45;"It actually does kind of feel like the same old dude from back in the day,"
01:38:45;01:38:51;"just like kind of horny, twinkle in his eye, kind of like a rap scallion."
01:38:51;01:38:52;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"But like fun."
01:38:55;01:38:59;"Search upon thy arch, farewell, au revoir."
01:38:59;01:39:02;"I'm going down to Woodstock in my beat-up Jaguar."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"There's no regrets."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"My beat-up Jaguar."
01:39:06;01:39:08;"He's going to Woodstock."
01:39:08;01:39:10;"Maybe just like the town."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"Like upstate New York?"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Yeah, he's just going upstate."
01:39:13;01:39:17;"But it's such a loaded, iconic town from the beginning of his career."
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Because he's like the old rocker."
01:39:19;01:39:20;"Yeah."
01:39:20;01:39:25;"I know that I can keep a secret, baby, can you too?"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"One more time, baby."
01:39:27;01:39:28;"Whoa."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"Keechan."
01:39:29;01:39:31;"One more time, baby."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"I encourage everybody to watch the video, too."
01:39:33;01:39:37;"It's also a good example of, like, Rod's, like, mid-70s."
01:39:37;01:39:40;"And he's still just kind of like--he really is a great performer."
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Yeah, that last verse, he's like,"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"I hope you find what you're searching for,"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"someone to cuddle and kiss you as you walk through the door"
01:39:47;01:39:51;"and honor you with children and stay together forever, forever."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"So it's bon voyage, farewell, au revoir."
01:39:53;01:39:56;"He's like, I'm going to Woodstock in my beat-up car."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Like, I'm not marriage material."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"I'm a horned dog who likes rocking with my country band."
01:40:01;01:40:05;"I also got to say, like, truly, that really is a--"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"I don't know if he wrote all the lyrics by himself."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"I think there's somebody else credited as a co-songwriter."
01:40:09;01:40:12;"But that turn of phrase is pretty, like, deep to say,"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"I hope you find what you're looking for,"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"someone who will honor you with children."
01:40:17;01:40:20;"That's, like, just such a kind of interesting way"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"and kind of, like, deep way to put it, where it's, like,"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"it's almost, like, Shakespearean."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"You know, in all those sonnets when there's--"
01:40:26;01:40:28;"there's always, like, talk about, like,"
01:40:28;01:40:32;"your beauty will be kept alive by the next generation."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"They're always talking about, like, children as, like,"
01:40:34;01:40:35;"even as your beauty fades,"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"your beauty will live eternally through your children."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"And there's something interesting about Rod saying that,"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"just kind of like, your beautiful woman,"
01:40:41;01:40:43;"sex with you was immense."
01:40:43;01:40:45;"I cannot honor you with children,"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"but that is an honor that you deserve."
01:40:47;01:40:49;"It's, like, very classy, kind of."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"Someone else should bestow you with that honor."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"It's almost like a horndog version of"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"I will always love you."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"Except it's let's have--"
01:40:58;01:41:00;"let's have sex one more time,"
01:41:00;01:41:04;"and I'll always remember how good it was."
01:41:04;01:41:05;"It's a hit."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"I liked when he was talking about Tears of Hercules,"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"and he was talking about, like,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"he almost got Solibowski."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"He was like, ""Grown men also cry."""
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:41:15;01:41:16;"Tears of Hercules."
01:41:16;01:41:19;"""Strong men also cry."""
01:41:19;01:41:20;"That's right."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"This album runs the gamut"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"from the horndog on the road to Woodstock"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"to the kind of wistful strong man"
01:41:27;01:41:29;"with tears in his eyes."
01:41:29;01:41:31;"31 albums, man."
01:41:31;01:41:32;"What an achievement."
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Unbelievable."
01:41:33;01:41:37;"Vampire Weekend's made four albums."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"You gotta pick up the pace, bud."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"That'd be tight."
01:41:39;01:41:42;"Just like in the local newspaper,"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"in some, like, village in the English countryside,"
01:41:44;01:41:47;"they're just like, ""Rod Stewart's opened a pub,"""
01:41:47;01:41:48;"and they just, like, go to interview him."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Just like, ""Where'd you get the idea?"""
01:41:49;01:41:51;"And he's like, ""You know, it's the strangest thing."
01:41:51;01:41:54;"""I was promoting my last album on this show, Time Crisis,"
01:41:54;01:41:57;"""talking to these two guys, Ezra and Jake."""

01:42:01;01:42:04;"Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and When I Die."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"I've never really had a handle on Blood, Sweat, and Tears."
01:42:06;01:42:08;"No few tunes."
01:42:08;01:42:11;"Are you a Blood, Sweat, and Tears fan, Jake?"
01:42:11;01:42:12;"No."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"Interesting, written by Laura Nero."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"Oh, yeah, beloved songwriter."
01:42:17;01:42:19;"I mean, it's like blue-eyed soul."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"It's like, right?"
01:42:21;01:42:23;"It's sort of like, it reminds me of, like,"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"this era, like Elvis."

01:54:37;01:54:41;"was not a ballsy stud and was being told that he couldn't smoke in the house,"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"so he had to smoke out the window."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"That's what I thought."
01:54:45;01:54:48;"I think if this song had come out in 1987,"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"then you'd be right on the money."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"I think cultural norms have shifted."
01:54:52;01:54:55;"Right. Nobody wants a smelly house."
01:54:55;01:54:58;"It'd be great to interview Arnold now and be like,"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"""Where are you at with Stogies?"""
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Maybe he's even doubled down."
01:55:02;01:55:05;"He said, ""I don't listen to anything that a woman tells me."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"I'm ballsy. I smoke my Stogies indoors."
01:55:08;01:55:10;"I s*** on the carpet."
01:55:10;01:55:13;"I pour spaghetti sauce onto the floor."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"I don't take out the garbage."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"I don't do the dishes."

01:55:22;01:55:24;"He's like, ""Damn, man. That sounds nasty."""

01:55:30;01:55:32;"It's my man cave."
01:55:32;01:55:37;"His wife made him build an additional wing to the house."
01:55:37;01:55:41;"It's so disgusting."
01:55:41;01:55:43;"There's animal s*** everywhere."

01:56:07;01:56:09;"No odor is emitted."
01:56:09;01:56:13;"You're a weird dude, Arnold."
01:56:13;01:56:20;"The number two song in 69, RB Greaves, ""Take a Letter, Maria."""

01:56:26;01:56:30;"Oh my God, Donna Jean of the Dead."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"Sing it. Sing backup on this."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"You don't think of her as actually a good singer."
01:56:35;01:56:39;"She was in one of the house studio musicians at Muscle Shoals"
01:56:39;01:56:41;"where this was recorded."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"Wow."
01:56:43;01:57:09;"Oh, he's leaving his wife for Maria?"
01:57:09;01:57:11;"No, Maria's his secretary."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"He's telling his secretary to..."
01:57:13;01:57:16;"He's dictating a letter to his secretary."
01:57:17;01:57:22;"You've been many things, but most of all, a good secretary to me."
01:57:22;01:57:28;"And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me."
01:57:28;01:57:34;"Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life?"
01:57:34;01:57:40;"All work and no play has just cost me a while."
01:57:40;01:57:43;"So take a letter, Maria."
01:57:43;01:57:46;"Maybe he's in love with Maria, but it hasn't been revealed yet."
01:57:46;01:57:47;"That might be the reveal."
01:57:47;01:57:49;"Oh, you know what? We missed the beginning."
01:57:49;01:57:54;"He got home last night, and his wife was cheating on him."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"Oh, I totally missed that."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"Yeah, the beginning."
01:57:57;01:57:59;"Last night as I got home about half past ten,"
01:57:59;01:58:02;"there was the woman I thought I knew in the arms of another man."
01:58:02;01:58:03;"Oh, right."
01:58:03;01:58:09;"When a man loves a woman, it's hard to understand."
01:58:09;01:58:15;"But she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man."
01:58:15;01:58:18;"I never really noticed."
01:58:18;01:58:20;"Donna's in that group?"
01:58:20;01:58:21;"Yeah."
01:58:21;01:58:22;"That's amazing."
01:58:22;01:58:26;"If it just so happens I'm free tonight, would you like to have dinner with me?"
01:58:26;01:58:28;"Oh, so then he asks his secretary out."
01:58:28;01:58:29;"Oh."
01:58:29;01:58:32;"The secretary's like, ""Man, you just got dumped by your wife,"
01:58:32;01:58:35;"and now you're asking me out the next day?"

01:58:40;01:58:43;"I would have liked it more if he just was like, one day,"

01:58:55;01:58:59;"If it was just sort of like, ""You know what? This is tedious."
01:58:59;01:59:02;"I'm not happy. I'm leaving."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"Dick, take this letter."""
01:59:04;01:59:06;"You know what? It's 1969."
01:59:06;01:59:09;"I fought in the Korean War."
01:59:09;01:59:12;"I've been working on Madison Avenue all these years."
01:59:12;01:59:15;"I think I'm ready just to disappear into the counterculture."
01:59:15;01:59:17;"My family is square."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"I'm leaving this job."
01:59:19;01:59:22;"Maria, this will be the last thing I ever ask you to do."
01:59:22;01:59:24;"Tell my wife I'm leaving her."
01:59:24;01:59:27;"Tell the rest of the company that I'm moving to San Francisco."
01:59:27;01:59:30;"And yeah, one more copy for my lawyer."
01:59:30;01:59:34;"Got that, Maria? Thanks. Peace."
01:59:34;01:59:38;"The number two song right now,"
01:59:38;01:59:41;"we already talked about this one, ""Adele - Easy On Me."""
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Oh, right. The big ballad."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Have you seen the video for this, Jake?"
01:59:45;01:59:47;"Are you following the Adele rollout?"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"No."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"Are you an Adele fan?"
01:59:51;01:59:53;"Do you have a favorite Adele song?"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"No, not really."
01:59:55;01:59:57;"Do you have a favorite one?"
01:59:57;02:00:01;"I mean, kind of. I like the one that Ariel produced when we were young."
02:00:01;02:00:04;"I remember I liked the chorus on this one."
02:00:04;02:00:07;"Like the way she sings ""easy."""
02:00:07;02:00:09;"Yeah, yeah, with those melismas."
02:00:09;02:00:12;"Kind of like descending melismas. Yeah."
02:00:13;02:00:17;"But I can't bring myself to swim"
02:00:17;02:00:23;"when I am drowning in this silence, baby."
02:00:23;02:00:26;"Let me in."
02:00:26;02:00:33;"Go easy on me, baby."
02:00:33;02:00:39;"It kind of reminds me of one of those really slow, journey power ballads."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Like ""Faithfully."""
02:00:41;02:00:43;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally."
02:00:43;02:00:45;"But in a good way."
02:00:45;02:00:47;"Yeah, I love those journey songs."
02:00:47;02:00:49;"Great balladeer."
02:00:49;02:00:53;"The number one song this week in 1969, ""The Fifth Dimension."""
02:00:53;02:00:55;"Another song written by Laura Niro."
02:00:55;02:00:57;"Wow."
02:00:57;02:00:59;"No, Niro. How do you say it? Niro."
02:00:59;02:01:01;"It was Laura Niro, right?"
02:01:01;02:01:03;"She was out there just writing big hits for everybody."
02:01:03;02:01:05;"So she had two songs of hers in the top five."
02:01:05;02:01:09;"""Wedding Bell Blues,"" she wrote this in 1966 for her debut album."
02:01:09;02:01:15;"And a few years later, as was often the case in the '60s, it was covered."
02:01:15;02:01:20;"And she also wrote ""Stone Soul Picnic,"" which was also a big hit for them."
02:01:20;02:01:25;"Bill, I love you so."
02:01:25;02:01:28;"And this song was addressed to a guy named Bill."
02:01:28;02:01:30;"Wow, Bill Maria Rosemary."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"Slipping in Bill."
02:01:49;02:01:51;"It's like musical theater."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"Oh, yeah, that part sounds familiar."
02:02:07;02:02:09;"[Singing]"
02:02:09;02:02:12;"I guess she's asking Bill to marry her."
02:02:12;02:02:15;"She wants to hear those wedding bells."
02:02:15;02:02:19;"Oh, yeah, the name, I just assumed, is somebody who doesn't want to get married."
02:02:19;02:02:24;"[Singing]"
02:02:24;02:02:32;"It's funny that this is '69, because the last two songs are so early '60s, the sentiment."
02:02:32;02:02:36;"This is a song about a woman begging a man named Bill to marry her."
02:02:36;02:02:38;"""Come on, marry me, Bill."""
02:02:38;02:02:40;"""Damn it, Bill, I need a ring on this finger."""
02:02:40;02:02:48;"Then the other one is about a man telling his secretary Maria to draft up a note for his lawyer."
02:02:48;02:02:50;"So '60s."
02:02:50;02:02:56;"We've talked about that, how often the top fives from the late '60s are still so square."
02:02:56;02:02:58;"Right, yeah, '69."
02:02:58;02:02:59;"Although, you're not going to get--"
02:02:59;02:03:04;"Flora Naira was pretty-- I thought she was a little more counterculture, but maybe--"
02:03:04;02:03:05;"Yeah, she was having fun with this song."
02:03:05;02:03:12;"She had written these songs three years prior, which in that era was a lifetime."
02:03:12;02:03:14;"Right, yeah, truly."
02:03:14;02:03:17;"And from '66 to '69, a lot changed."
02:03:17;02:03:20;"The number one song right now in 2021--"
02:03:20;02:03:22;"We're definitely not going to be able to listen to this--"
02:03:22;02:03:26;"is Taylor Swift's ""All Too Well"" 10-minute version."
02:03:26;02:03:28;"Now, the--"
02:03:28;02:03:29;"Wow."
02:03:29;02:03:32;"We were talking about this a little bit on the thread, because somebody made a joke,"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"""Is Taylor Swift a jam band?"""
02:03:34;02:03:35;"Right."
02:03:35;02:03:38;"So we talked previously about how she's re-recording a lot of her old albums"
02:03:38;02:03:44;"so that she can regain control of her masters, which seems like she's doing a very good job of."
02:03:44;02:03:49;"But she's also having some fun with them, and I guess this song was a fan favorite."
02:03:49;02:03:55;"So we got to assume that the 10-minute version just has more verses."
02:03:55;02:03:57;"Have you heard it?"
02:03:57;02:03:58;"No."
02:03:58;02:04:00;"10 minutes?"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"It's like a folk song, just with a lot of verses."
02:04:02;02:04:04;"It's like ""Desolation Row"" or something."
02:04:04;02:04:05;"Yeah."
02:04:05;02:04:06;"[MUSIC - TAYLOR SWIFT, ""DESOLATION ROW""]"
02:04:10;02:04:13;"So she performed the 10-minute version on SNL."
02:04:13;02:04:14;"That's cool."
02:04:14;02:04:17;"Listen, whether it's adding extra verses or jamming,"
02:04:17;02:04:23;"always got to support a blank-minute version of any song."
02:04:23;02:04:24;"Especially double-digit."
02:04:24;02:04:26;"It's got to be eight minimum."
02:04:26;02:04:27;"Yeah."
02:04:27;02:04:30;"10, even better."
02:04:30;02:04:34;"Oh, so it says she originally wrote a 10-minute version, but she was--"
02:04:34;02:04:38;"she didn't want to have a 10-minute version on the album, so she cut down a lot of verses."
02:04:38;02:04:39;"All right."
02:04:39;02:04:40;"Oh, I see."
02:04:40;02:04:41;"OK."
02:04:41;02:04:43;"Well, time to wrap it up."
02:04:43;02:04:47;"I think we should go out with one more Rod Stewart song."
02:04:47;02:04:49;"Let's go out with ""You Wear It Well."""
02:04:49;02:04:52;"Shout out to Martin Quittenden--"

02:04:53;02:04:55;"I don't know how to say it."
02:04:55;02:04:58;"Thank you so much to Rod Stewart for coming through."
02:04:58;02:04:59;"That was great."
