00:00;00:06;"Tom Crisis 8, we finally made it."
00:06;00:12;"I'm back in New York, and that means I'm back with Despot and Cousin Asher."
00:12;00:13;"But that's not all."
00:13;00:21;"We'll be joined by legendary actor/writer Jonah Hill, and legendary rapper/singer I"
00:21;00:22;"Love Makonnen."
00:22;00:27;"We'll also be counting down the hits and talking about the surprising connection between"
00:27;00:30;"Adolf Hitler, Drake, and the Taliban."
00:31;00:33;"Time Crisis."
00:33;00:35;"It's located in..."
00:35;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:50;"The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:05;"And so I dealt to the floor, one of us had to go."
01:05;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:25;"Leave a lonely man, staring at the ceiling."
01:25;01:32;"Wishing she was somewhere else instead."
01:32;01:38;"One of us is lonely, one of us is gone."
01:38;01:48;"All that night, I been..."
01:48;01:50;"With that white light."
01:50;01:54;"All up in the corner, my issue is she's goddamn booming, boy."
01:54;01:58;"Back in New York, I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy."
01:58;02:02;"All up in the 80s, my issue is still gravy, yeah."
02:02;02:06;"Shout out to your lady, yeah, yeah, she became my lady."
02:06;02:10;"Hit her with the drop top when I hit that highway, boy."
02:10;02:14;"She keeps on on my shit, cost like fireways, boy."
02:14;02:18;"I got a hoe outside, she gon' pull up right now."
02:18;02:22;"And she gon' make it all go down."
02:22;02:26;"All my issues, tell me, nigga, I'm best."
02:26;02:30;"If you ain't know, it's coming from the West."
02:30;02:33;"We gon' kick this shit off in the South."
02:33;02:37;"I'ma turn it up and I'ma, ay, turn it up."
02:37;02:39;"Where your girl at?"
02:39;02:41;"Watch me turn it out."
02:41;02:45;"Like, huh, ay, all in her mouth."
02:45;02:47;"Huh, where your girl at?"
02:47;02:49;"Watch me turn it out."
02:49;02:52;"That was our good friend Olive Maconin with ""Where Your Girl At?"""
02:52;02:54;"This is ""Time Crisis."""
02:54;02:57;"The reason I played that is because I'm back in New York,"
02:57;03:00;"I feel like Patrick Ewing, boy."
03:00;03:04;"And being back in New York and feeling like Patrick Ewing,"
03:04;03:07;"I'm finally joined once again by the original ""Time Crisis"" team."
03:07;03:09;"Cousin Asher, how you doing, man?"
03:09;03:11;"I'm good. How you doing, Ezra? Good to be back."
03:11;03:14;"Good to be back. And Despot, what's up, dude?"
03:14;03:16;"Hi, man. Welcome back to New York."
03:16;03:18;"Thank you. Welcome back to New York yourself."
03:18;03:19;"Thank you."
03:19;03:22;"We heard you've been on a ward tour all around the world."
03:22;03:23;"Yeah."
03:23;03:24;"Where you been?"
03:24;03:26;"I actually only went to two places."
03:26;03:27;"But two--"
03:27;03:29;"Were they far away from each other?"
03:29;03:32;"Yeah, two places that are pretty far away from each other."
03:32;03:34;"The first one being Tokyo."
03:34;03:37;"The second one being Paris."
03:37;03:39;"The third one being Miami."
03:39;03:41;"But I came back here first."
03:41;03:44;"That's a world tour. That's like the world showcase at Disney World."
03:44;03:46;"I feel like Paris and Tokyo."
03:46;03:47;"And Miami."
03:47;03:49;"That's some real jet set sh*t."
03:49;03:51;"Yeah, I did my thing."
03:51;03:53;"All right, so real quick, out of those three cities, which is the best?"
03:53;03:54;"Tokyo."
03:54;03:55;"Which is the worst?"
03:55;03:56;"Paris."
03:56;03:57;"Okay."
03:57;04:00;"Wow. You were already here first."
04:00;04:03;"I'm very happy to be back here in New York City."
04:03;04:05;"I've been in LA too long."
04:05;04:07;"I got nothing against LA, but it's hot, man."
04:07;04:08;"You've been keeping it too real."
04:08;04:10;"I've been keeping it way too real."
04:10;04:13;"I think this is the first official autumn show."
04:13;04:15;"Yeah, sweater weather."
04:15;04:16;"Of Time Crisis."
04:16;04:20;"Back in New York, feeling like Patrick Ewing, the air is crisp outside."
04:20;04:24;"So I was thinking, what's some kind of autumnal music that I could play?"
04:24;04:28;"And as you know on this show, we haven't played that much new music."
04:28;04:31;"Every episode, we get a little bit closer to the modern era."
04:31;04:35;"And I know some people would probably appreciate hearing some music from the past 20 years."
04:35;04:38;"So I thought, what's music that reminds me of fall?"
04:38;04:39;"So I'll take you back."
04:39;04:41;"The fall of 2001."
04:41;04:45;"America is reeling from a major terrorist attack."
04:45;04:50;"And on that same day, as people often talk about, The Strokes' first album came out."
04:50;04:52;"I don't talk about that."
04:52;04:54;"Despot can't shut up about it."
04:54;04:59;"I always say to Despot, you know, man, Jay-Z's Blueprint also came out on September 11, 2001."
04:59;05:04;"He says, yeah, man, but the one that really sums up New York City culture is The Strokes' Is This It?"
05:04;05:06;"And I say, you know, to each his own."
05:06;05:10;"So I have memories of kind of October, November, that era."
05:10;05:12;"You and I were both seniors in high school."
05:12;05:14;"Yeah, I had a burn copy of that."
05:14;05:16;"Just living out in Jersey."
05:16;05:20;"One of them has a crazy name, like Fabrizio or something."
05:20;05:22;"Yeah, Fabrizio Moretti."
05:22;05:23;"That's crazy."
05:23;05:24;"He's a great dude."
05:24;05:27;"So this was always my favorite song from that Strokes album."
05:27;05:29;"I feel like in the early days of Time Crisis, I wouldn't have played this."
05:29;05:31;"But now I just want to play the hits."
05:31;05:32;"You know what I mean?"
05:32;05:34;"I just want to play for real indie fans."
05:34;05:38;"So here's The Strokes with a real song that reminds me of autumn."
05:38;05:40;"Someday."
05:58;06:02;"In many ways, they'll miss the good old days."
06:02;06:06;"Someday, someday."
06:06;06:11;"Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay."
06:11;06:15;"Sometimes, sometimes."
06:15;06:20;"When we were young, how many we had fun."
06:20;06:24;"Always, always."
06:24;06:29;"Promises, they break before they're made."
06:29;06:33;"Sometimes, sometimes."
06:33;06:39;"All my answers are like any tale."
06:39;06:43;"I will do my best."
06:43;06:48;"You say you want to stay by my side."
06:48;06:52;"Darling, your head's not right."
06:52;06:56;"I still always die and together we fall apart."
06:56;07:01;"Yeah, I think I'll be all right."
07:01;07:06;"I'm working so I won't have to try so hard."
07:06;07:09;"Tables, they turn sometimes."
07:09;07:15;"Oh, someday."
07:15;07:20;"No, I ain't wasting no more time."
07:38;07:42;"Now my fears, they come to me in threes."
07:42;07:46;"So I, sometimes,"
07:46;07:51;"They play to my friends and we're the strangest things."
07:51;07:55;"I find, sometimes,"
07:55;08:00;"All my answers are like any tale."
08:00;08:04;"I will try my best."
08:04;08:09;"You say you want to stay by my side."
08:09;08:13;"Darling, your head's not right."
08:13;08:17;"I still always die and together we fall apart."
08:17;08:22;"Yeah, I think I'll be all right."
08:22;08:27;"I'm working so I won't have to try so hard."
08:27;08:31;"Tables, they turn sometimes."
08:31;08:37;"Oh, someday."
08:37;08:41;"I ain't wasting no more time."
09:10;09:15;"Dead leaves and the dirty ground"
09:15;09:19;"When I know you're not around."
09:19;09:22;"Shiny tops and soda bottles"
09:22;09:26;"When I hear your lips make a sound."
09:30;09:33;"30 notes in the mailbox"
09:33;09:37;"When I tell you that I'm coming home."
09:41;09:44;"And I think I'm gonna stick around for a while"
09:44;09:46;"So you're not alone."
09:46;09:49;"For a while so you're not alone."
10:02;10:04;"If you can hear a piano fall"
10:04;10:08;"You can hear me coming down the hall."
10:08;10:10;"If I could just hear your prettier voice"
10:10;10:13;"I don't think I need to say it at all."
10:13;10:17;"Don't think I need to say it at all."
10:17;10:19;"Soft hair and a velvet tongue"
10:19;10:23;"I want to give you what you give to me."
10:23;10:25;"And every breath that is in your lungs"
10:25;10:28;"Is a tiny little gift to me."
10:47;10:51;"I didn't feel so bad 'til the sun went down."
10:56;10:59;"Then I come home."
10:59;11:02;"No wonder why my arms are round."
11:02;11:06;"Why my arms are round."
11:06;11:09;"Not any man with a microphone"
11:09;11:13;"Can tell you what he loves the most."
11:13;11:15;"And you know why you love it all"
11:15;11:18;"If you're thinking of the Holy Ghost."
11:33;11:35;"That was The White Stripes with Dead Leaves"
11:35;11:36;"and the Dirty Ground."
11:36;11:38;"That was another song that reminds me"
11:38;11:40;"of autumn in the early 2000s."
11:40;11:43;"Those were two big bands kind of coming out,"
11:43;11:45;"reshaping the sound of rock 'n' roll"
11:45;11:46;"in the early 2000s,"
11:46;11:48;"The White Stripes and The Strokes."
11:48;11:50;"They used to play shows together."
11:50;11:51;"I remember that show."
11:51;11:52;"You saw them together?"
11:52;11:53;"Yeah, Radio City."
11:53;11:59;"Yeah, I got a T-shirt that was like a triple XL"
11:59;12:01;"because it was the only one they had left"
12:01;12:02;"of the merch table."
12:02;12:04;"Just 'cause I was that into it"
12:04;12:06;"and I tried to wear it one time and pull it off."
12:06;12:07;"It did not work."
12:07;12:09;"You felt like you were witnessing history."
12:09;12:12;"Yeah, I just felt like that's never going to happen again."
12:12;12:14;"I'd probably have the shirt somewhere."
12:14;12:16;"I mean, those are two classic bands"
12:16;12:18;"and they're still doing their things."
12:18;12:19;"Kind of, in a sense."
12:19;12:20;"In a sense."
12:20;12:21;"Now that we're back in New York,"
12:21;12:24;"it's especially important that we get into some New York news."
12:24;12:25;"So let's hit it."
12:25;12:29;"This is New York News."
12:29;12:34;"Our producer Colin has printed out a few pieces"
12:34;12:37;"of various news items that we're going to talk about right now."
12:37;12:39;"The first one I want to talk about,"
12:39;12:40;"this is the headline,"
12:40;12:42;"""Conde Nast buys Pitchfork Media,"
12:42;12:43;"seeks Millennial Male Demo."""
12:43;12:44;"Whoa."
12:44;12:47;"""Conde Nast, which is a big media company,"
12:47;12:50;"bought Pitchfork Media, which is a smaller media company."""
12:50;12:53;"And I guess one of the guys at Conde Nast"
12:53;12:54;"said something about how--"
12:54;12:59;"He just pronounced it ""Conde Nast"" and then ""Conde Nast."""
12:59;13:01;"And the first time he pronounced it ""Conde Nast,"""
13:01;13:03;"I was like, ""Is that how you pronounce it?"""
13:03;13:05;"And then he pronounced it the other way."
13:05;13:06;"So now I'm really confused."
13:06;13:08;"ASAP Conde Nast."
13:08;13:10;"I say ""Conde Nast"" both times, I think."
13:10;13:11;"But maybe it's ""Nast."""
13:11;13:13;"No, you said ""Nast"" the first time."
13:13;13:14;"It stood out to me."
13:14;13:19;"Well, Fred Santarpia of Conde Nast said"
13:19;13:25;"that this purchase is going to bring Conde Nast,"
13:25;13:27;"a very passionate audience of Millennial Males,"
13:27;13:28;"into our roster."
13:28;13:32;"Good for them. That's a hard demographic to reach."
13:32;13:36;"I mean, everybody knows that Millennial Males are a--holes."
13:36;13:37;"I can't stand them."
13:37;13:39;"You bring a Millennial Male around me,"
13:39;13:40;"we're going to have problems."
13:40;13:42;"How much blood purchasing power?"
13:42;13:43;"But they do have purchasing power."
13:43;13:46;"How much money do you think a guy like Ryan Shriver"
13:46;13:48;"just got when this happened?"
13:48;13:49;"They're not saying."
13:49;13:52;"Easily a hundred billion dollars."
13:52;13:56;"I truly have no idea how much it cost to buy a website."
13:56;13:58;"I mean, I don't know."
13:58;13:59;"I honestly don't know how any of this stuff works."
13:59;14:02;"I know that they try to sell hipster runoff,"
14:02;14:04;"and I think that went for about $15,000."
14:04;14:05;"For real?"
14:05;14:07;"I mean, Pitchfork is definitely a bigger website,"
14:07;14:08;"don't get me wrong."
14:08;14:09;"So like 20?"
14:09;14:10;"Probably."
14:10;14:12;"I truly have no idea."
14:12;14:14;"I don't--this digital landscape terrifies me."
14:14;14:16;"It's got to be millions, right?"
14:16;14:17;"It's got to be like--"
14:17;14:18;"Millions of dollars?"
14:18;14:19;"Yeah."
14:19;14:21;"I don't know how you make money on the internet."
14:21;14:22;"Like that."
14:22;14:24;"You get bought by a big company."

17:56;17:59;"I want my wrist so cold, pneumonia in my fist."
17:59;18:03;"My wrist done turned so cold, my arm got runny nose."
18:03;18:07;"I flip it for the high and get it for the low."
18:07;18:09;"I'm hooked for all these shows."
18:09;18:11;"I cook for all these."
18:11;18:14;"We turn a neighborhood kitchen into a five-star stove."
18:14;18:18;"Super Chef Macon and my sprinkle serotonin."
18:18;18:22;"Be careful when you [MUTED] because my wrist so [MUTED]"
18:22;18:24;"Oh, [MUTED] you snowing."

18:33;18:37;"I want my wrist so cold, pneumonia in my fist."
18:37;18:41;"Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist."
18:41;18:45;"Never had the whip-up-whip-up, but I get the gist."
18:45;18:48;"Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist."
18:48;18:52;"I want my wrist so cold, pneumonia in my fist."
18:52;18:56;"Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist."
18:56;18:59;"Never had the whip-up-whip-up, but I get the gist."
18:59;19:03;"I hurt my [MUTED] wrist trying to [MUTED] on you."
19:03;19:07;"I hurt my [MUTED] wrist doing donuts in the six."
19:07;19:10;"Wrist, wrist, wrist, man, I hurt my [MUTED] wrist."
19:10;19:13;"Pulling wrist, man, you wouldn't understand."
19:13;19:17;"But if I catch you up, I'm going to catch you up."
19:17;19:19;"And I ain't from the shop."
19:19;19:22;"You just don't understand what I said."
19:22;19:23;"Man, I'm outside."
19:23;19:26;"Man, I'm outside with my old [MUTED]"

20:06;20:07;"Yeah."

20:09;20:10;"Yeah."
20:10;20:12;"Halloween."
20:12;20:13;"Taliban."
20:14;20:16;"Taliban."
20:16;20:17;"Yeah."
20:17;20:19;"Jump in, jump in, jump in."
20:19;20:21;"Them boys up to something."
20:21;20:24;"They just spent like two or three weeks out of the country."
20:24;20:25;"Them boys up to something."
20:25;20:27;"They just not just bluffing."
20:27;20:29;"You don't have to call."
20:29;20:31;"I hit my dance like Usher, ooh."
20:31;20:34;"I just found my tempo like on DJ Mustard, ooh."
20:34;20:38;"I hit that Jenobe with my left hand, though, like, ooh."
20:38;20:41;"Lobster and saline for all my babies that I miss."
20:41;20:44;"Chicken finger, french fry for all them hoes that want to dance."
20:44;20:46;"Jump in, jump in, jump in."
20:46;20:48;"Them boys up to something."
20:48;20:51;"Uh-uh-uh, I think I need some Robitussin."
20:51;20:54;"Way too many questions, you must think I trust you."
20:54;20:58;"You searching for answers, I do not know nothing, ooh."
20:58;21:01;"I see them tweaking, they know something's coming, ooh."
21:01;21:03;"Jump in, jump in, jump in."

21:18;21:19;"Them boys just not bluffing."
21:19;21:21;"Them boys just not bluffing."
21:21;21:22;"Jump in, jump in, jump in."
21:22;21:24;"Them boys up to something."
21:24;21:28;"She was trying to join a team, I told her, wait."
21:28;21:31;"Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates."
21:31;21:35;"No boo, no boo, no boo, no boo, no boo, no boo."
21:35;21:38;"I just throw the private dinner in the--"
21:38;21:41;"tripping is a habit, that's the way for me."
21:41;21:45;"Money coming fast, we never getting straight."
21:45;21:48;"I just had to buy another set."
21:48;21:51;"Feeling spurs of phantom joy that fade away."
21:51;21:53;"Yeah, jump in, jump in."
21:53;21:55;"I don't need no introduction."
21:55;21:58;"Jump in, jump in, Metro booming on production, wow."
21:58;22:02;"100 cousins out in Memphis, they so country, wow."
22:02;22:05;"Tell her stay the night, valet, your car come [bleep] me now."
22:05;22:08;"Jump in, jump in, live on TNT, I'm flexing, ooh."
22:08;22:12;"Jump in, jump in, they gave me my own collection, ooh."
22:12;22:15;"Jump when I say jump, girl, can you take direction, ooh."
22:15;22:18;"Mutombo with the-- you keep getting rejected, ooh."
22:18;22:22;"Heard it came through Magic City on a Monday."
22:22;22:25;"Heard they had the club wild, it was star-studded."
22:25;22:28;"A bunch of girls going wild when your chain flooded."
22:28;22:32;"And I had them like, wow, cup-dudded."
22:32;22:35;"Dope man, dope man, dope man, dope man, dope man, dope man."
22:35;22:39;"Money on the counter, choppers on the floor."
22:39;22:42;"I just caught that tempo, DJ must've woke."
22:42;22:46;"Way too much codeine and now the raw."
22:46;22:49;"We just count those paperbacks, whoa."
22:49;22:52;"I know I'ma get my big back, whoa."
22:52;22:54;"I count all these racks that I have on me now."
22:54;22:56;"I'ma have you like, what?"
24:20;24:22;"On Halloween, we've all seen it."
24:22;24:28;"Some supposedly funny costumes definitely cross the line into offensiveness."
24:28;24:31;"Is Drake dressing up as Taliban for Halloween offensive?"
24:31;24:32;"Asher?"
24:32;24:34;"Yeah, probably."
24:34;24:38;"Yeah, I don't think... I'm trying to think of a situation where you can get away with it."
24:38;24:41;"I can't really think of a situation for Drake to pull it off."
24:41;24:47;"I'm willing to believe that a lot of these political situations are more complicated than the mainstream media lets us know."
24:47;24:53;"But, like, I'm not saying that you gotta be all rah-rah for the US/Canadian military forces."
24:53;24:59;"But, I don't know, as like a joke costume, dressing up like a member of a kind of right wing..."
24:59;25:04;"Yeah, but what is it, 2015? That's an old costume. At least do like ISIS or something."
25:04;25:05;"Right?"
25:05;25:07;"If you're gonna be offensive, at least be Taliban."
25:07;25:09;"I would be offended by that too."
25:09;25:11;"Taliban still exist though."
25:11;25:13;"Taliban, they're still doing their thing."
25:13;25:15;"That's true. Still current."
25:15;25:21;"That's a good question. Our producer just asked us if we think that Drake dressing up as Hitler would be an offensive Halloween costume."
25:21;25:23;"Alec, you're a Jewish-American."
25:23;25:27;"I mean, you know, yes."
25:27;25:33;"But, you know, if I were Drake and I dressed up as Hitler..."
25:33;25:38;"You should be Drake dressed up as Hitler for Halloween."
25:38;25:42;"No, I wouldn't do that. My middle name is Israel. That's what I would say."
25:42;25:43;"Your middle name is Israel?"
25:43;25:44;"Yeah."
25:44;25:45;"Alec Israel?"
25:45;25:46;"Mm-hmm."
25:46;25:47;"Wow."
25:47;25:48;"My initials are Air."
25:48;25:49;"That's crazy."
25:49;25:51;"For real. Jump man, jump man, jump man."
25:51;25:54;"That's amazing."
25:54;25:59;"At the end of the day, Drake, you dress up as whatever you want because, frankly, you're such a cultural force."
25:59;26:02;"He should be Michael Jordan for Halloween. It's a no-brainer."
26:02;26:03;"That's a good idea."
26:03;26:04;"He should be who?"
26:04;26:05;"Michael Jordan."
26:05;26:06;"Here's another idea."
26:06;26:13;"Wear like some wide leg, acid-wash jeans with like a two-long blazer and like some An1 sneakers."
26:13;26:14;"Avelord jumpsuit."
26:14;26:18;"Here's an idea that Drake could actually pull off very well if he grew his hair out a little bit."
26:18;26:21;"It's Mario because I was doing some research."
26:21;26:25;"You know what the original... Mario, for people who don't know, he's a character."
26:25;26:29;"He's an Italian-American plumber from Brooklyn created by Japanese men."
26:29;26:33;"First in a 1980s game called Donkey Kong."
26:33;26:36;"And in Donkey Kong, he wasn't called Mario yet. You know what he was called?"
26:36;26:37;"No."
26:37;26:41;"Jump man. He was called jump man. So the original name of Mario is jump man."
26:41;26:42;"Because he jumped a lot."
26:42;26:43;"That's all he did was jump."
26:43;26:44;"Jumped over barrels."
26:44;26:46;"He jumped over barrels."
26:46;26:47;"That was thrown by a monkey."
26:47;26:48;"That was his only weapon."
26:48;26:50;"So here's what I propose."
26:50;26:53;"Drake, you be Mario. Future, you be Luigi."
26:53;26:57;"And then we don't have to deal with all this Taliban Hitler stuff."
26:57;27:00;"Still offensive to Italian-Americans, I think."
27:00;27:01;"Ah."
27:01;27:04;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
27:04;27:07;"In a Latin bar, yeah."
27:07;27:13;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
27:13;27:18;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
27:18;27:21;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
27:21;27:27;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
27:27;27:30;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
27:30;27:34;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
27:34;27:38;"I saw you from the basketball."
27:38;27:42;"I love the Spanish cuisine."
27:42;27:46;"That's all they keep the way I talk."
27:46;27:49;"Put it in the light to taste it."
27:49;27:53;"Spanish cuisine you prepare."
27:53;27:55;"In a beautiful way."
27:55;27:58;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
27:58;28:01;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
28:04;28:10;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
28:10;28:12;"Stain."
28:12;28:15;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
28:15;28:19;"In a Latin bar, yeah."
28:19;28:24;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
28:24;28:26;"Stain."
28:26;28:30;"I'ma tell all my boys about you, niña."
28:30;28:34;"Hope this is your number, I'm calling you, niña."
28:34;28:37;"Hopefully you come kick it with me, niña."
28:37;28:41;"We can cha-cha between a sheet, niña."
28:41;28:44;"I'ma tell all my boys about you, niña."
28:44;28:48;"Hope this is your number, I'm calling you, niña."
28:48;28:51;"Hopefully you come kick it with me, niña."
28:51;28:54;"We can cha-cha between a sheet, niña."
28:54;28:58;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
28:58;29:01;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
29:01;29:08;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
29:08;29:12;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
29:12;29:15;"In a Latin bar, yeah."
29:15;29:21;"With a Dominican and reasonable stain."
29:21;29:22;"Stain."
29:22;29:23;"Yeah."
29:23;29:25;"Yeah."
29:25;29:29;"You're looking for a better feeling out there tonight."
29:29;29:34;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
29:34;29:35;"Ooh."
29:35;29:43;"You're looking for a better feeling out there tonight."
29:43;29:48;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
29:48;29:49;"Ooh."
29:49;29:53;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
29:53;29:54;"Ooh."
29:54;29:59;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
29:59;30:00;"Ooh."
30:00;30:05;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
30:05;30:06;"Ooh."
30:06;30:11;"You're looking for the perfect night for you."
30:11;30:13;"Ooh."
30:13;30:20;"Like the chameleon that's hanging with Miss Prism."
30:20;30:24;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
30:24;30:27;"It's the Latin girl I'm to claim."
30:27;30:29;"First boyfriend, real quick."
30:29;30:34;"Two-by-two, now you're my claim."
30:34;30:38;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
30:38;30:41;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
31:05;31:07;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
31:07;31:10;"I like to cha-cha, ay."
34:43;34:51;"When you were young and your heart was an open book,"
34:51;34:55;"you used to say, live and let live."
34:55;34:59;"You know you did, you know you did, you know you did."
34:59;35:05;"But if this ever-changing world in which we're living"
35:05;35:12;"makes you give in and cry,"
35:12;35:14;"say live and let die."
35:14;35:21;"Live and let die."
35:21;35:25;"Live and let die."
35:25;35:27;"Live and let die."
36:02;36:07;"What does it matter to you when you got a job to do?"
36:07;36:10;"You got to do it well."
36:10;36:13;"You got to keep the other man ahead."
36:19;36:43;"You used to say, live and let live."
36:43;36:47;"You know you did, you know you did, you know you did."
36:47;36:53;"But if this ever-changing world in which we're living"
36:53;37:01;"makes you give in and cry, say live and let die."
37:01;37:08;"Live and let die."
37:08;37:12;"Live and let die."
37:12;37:15;"Live and let die."
37:57;38:08;"You only live twice, or so it seems."
38:08;38:14;"One life for yourself and one for your dreams."
38:19;38:31;"You drift through the years, and life seems tame."
38:31;38:36;"Till one dream appears, and love is its name."
38:41;38:52;"And love is a stranger who'd beckon you on."
38:52;39:02;"Don't think of the danger, or the stranger is gone."
39:02;39:13;"This dream is for you, someday the prize."
39:13;39:19;"In one dream come true, you only live twice."
39:30;39:45;"And love is a stranger who'd beckon you on."
39:45;39:55;"Don't think of the danger, or the stranger is gone."
39:55;40:06;"This dream is for you, someday the prize."
40:06;40:15;"In one dream come true, you only live twice."
40:32;40:36;"OK, that was Nancy Sinatra with ""You Only Live Twice."""
40:36;40:39;"Yolt, yolt, yolt."
40:39;40:40;"AKA--"
40:40;40:43;"[LAUGHTER]"
40:43;40:45;"Now, a lot of people forget--"
40:45;40:46;"Hashtag yolt."
40:46;40:49;"That's a very good point, because back when we were kids,"
40:49;40:51;"everybody was always saying YOLO."
40:51;40:54;"Remember back in middle school, because Drake popularized that?"
40:54;40:55;"But back in the '60s--"
40:55;40:56;"When we were 11."
40:56;40:58;"Back in the '60s, in our parents' generation,"
40:58;40:59;"they used to say yolt."
40:59;41:00;"You only live twice."
41:00;41:02;"So that was another great James Bond song."
41:02;41:05;"That one's really beautiful, and it was sampled by Robbie Williams."
41:05;41:06;"Yeah."
41:06;41:07;"For his--"
41:07;41:10;"It's the one where he goes around the roller rink or whatever, right?"
41:10;41:11;"No, that was a different one."
41:11;41:12;"Oh, really?"
41:12;41:14;"This is one where he's kind of dressed like James Bond."
41:14;41:17;"But I wanted to play one more James Bond song."
41:17;41:20;"A lot of people don't know that this one is a James Bond song,"
41:20;41:24;"because this is another one of those songs that's really much bigger than James Bond."
41:24;41:26;"This is Carly Simon, ""Nobody Does It Better."""
41:26;41:27;"You know that was a James Bond song?"
41:27;41:28;"Really?"
41:28;41:29;"No, I had no idea."
41:29;41:31;"It was from the film ""The Spy Who Loved Me."""
41:31;41:35;"And if you listen, you'll hear she randomly says ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" later."
41:35;41:37;"Oh, so she got the name check in."
41:37;41:43;"Yeah, and also, one thing about this song is I have a technique to help when you're feeling low,"
41:43;41:44;"when you're not feeling good about yourself."
41:44;41:48;"A lot of pop songs are all about how great somebody else is."
41:48;41:51;"But sometimes you need a song about how great you are."
41:51;41:54;"And all you have to do is change the ""you"" to the ""I."""
41:54;41:56;"So for instance, this song, ""Nobody Does It Better."""
41:56;41:57;"""Baby, I'm the Best."""
41:57;41:58;"Yeah."
41:58;42:00;"So this is all you've got to do."
42:00;42:02;"Look yourself in the mirror, play this, and sing yourself."
42:02;42:05;"Nobody does it better."
42:05;42:08;"Makes me feel bad for the rest."
42:08;42:11;"Nobody does it half as good as me."
42:11;42:14;"Baby, I'm the best."
42:14;42:15;"That was beautiful."
42:15;42:16;"You're going to feel like a million bucks."
42:16;42:17;"Sounds like a Campbell's commercial."
42:17;42:22;"The original one is not quite as uplifting because she's talking more about you."
42:22;42:25;"But let's listen to a Carly song on ""Nobody Does It Better."""
42:25;42:33;"Nobody does it better."
42:33;42:41;"Makes me feel sad for the rest."
42:41;42:49;"Nobody does it half as good as you."

43:38;43:46;"Nobody does it quite the way you do."
43:46;43:53;"Why'd you have to be so good?"
43:53;44:00;"The way that you hold me, whenever you hold me,"
44:00;44:07;"there's some kind of magic inside you."
44:07;44:13;"It keeps me from running, but just keep it coming."
44:13;44:20;"How'd you learn to do the things you do?"
44:20;44:28;"And nobody does it better."
44:28;44:35;"Makes me feel sad for the rest."
44:35;44:43;"Nobody does it half as good as you."

49:52;49:53;"But he's a man."
49:53;49:54;"Yeah."
49:54;49:57;"I mean, I would use that term loosely."

49:59;50:00;"He's a young man."
50:00;50:01;"He's boyish, but he's a man."
50:01;50:03;"Okay, well, here's what I'm gonna say."
50:03;50:04;"I will always support new artists."
50:04;50:05;"Always."
50:05;50:06;"I will always--"
50:06;50:07;"It's nice to hear something new on the top five."
50:07;50:08;"I'll say that."
50:08;50:09;"And I'll always support new artists"
50:09;50:10;"because I gotta say, you know,"
50:10;50:11;"when ""Vampire Weekend"" came out,"
50:11;50:13;"you know we had our haters."
50:13;50:15;"Still do, of course."
50:15;50:20;"But the one thing, critics gonna critique."
50:20;50:22;"Haters gonna also critique."
50:22;50:24;"But the one thing that I always said to myself"
50:24;50:27;"is when you see these older artists"
50:27;50:29;"and a new band comes out on their first album,"
50:29;50:30;"like youngish people,"

50:40;50:41;"Sure."
50:41;50:42;"I just think that's corny."

50:47;50:51;"[laughter]"
50:51;50:53;"Well, that, my friend, is where we differ."
50:53;50:54;"But anyway--"
50:54;50:55;"That line was not manipulative."
50:55;50:56;"But anyway, look--"
50:56;50:58;"You could put those hand claps on anything."
50:58;50:59;"It would be in the iTunes top five."

51:00;51:02;"I like a lot of you on the new music."
51:02;51:03;"Try it, my friend."
51:03;51:04;"Okay."

52:58;52:59;"Yeah."

53:03;53:04;"Mm-hmm."
53:04;53:07;"Like, I might call somebody handsome,"
53:07;53:10;"and you might say that he's ugly as hell."
53:10;53:12;"But short and tall are basically--"
53:12;53:14;"we as a society agree that some people are short"
53:14;53:15;"and some people are tall."
53:15;53:18;"So when you say that he's so tall,"

54:03;54:05;"some of which have to do with height,"

54:08;54:12;"Do you think Taylor Swift pays New York City income tax?"

54:17;54:20;"it depends where you establish your primary residency."
54:20;54:21;"Here, though."
54:21;54:22;"She made a whole commercial about it."
54:22;54:24;"Yeah, she's the ambassador."
54:24;54:25;"Yeah, she has to."
54:25;54:26;"No."
54:26;54:27;"Who knows?"
54:27;54:32;"Yeah, but if word gets out that Taylor's primary residence"
54:32;54:35;"on paper is not New York, she's going to be ousted,"
54:35;54:37;"and she won't be the ambassador anymore,"
54:37;54:41;"and they'll take that song she made back, probably."
54:41;54:43;"Maybe they'll make me the ambassador."
54:43;54:47;"And we're back."
54:47;54:49;"Are you guys ready for the number three song?"
54:49;54:50;"Yes."
54:50;54:53;"This is ""The Weeknd"" with The Hills featuring Eminem."
54:53;54:54;"This is a remix."
54:54;54:55;"You guys remember Eminem?"
54:55;54:56;"Yeah."
54:56;54:57;"Remember back in the '90s?"
54:57;54:59;"Back in the '90s, I remember this."
54:59;55:00;"I was 13."
55:00;55:02;"Everybody was playing video games,"
55:02;55:03;"and everybody was listening to Eminem,"
55:03;55:06;"and those are two things that I kind of miss about that time,"
55:06;55:08;"so I'm kind of happy to see that The Weeknd's bringing Eminem back."
55:08;55:10;"Let's listen to his guest verse."
55:10;55:26;"What?"
55:26;55:27;"Wait, what?"
55:27;55:28;"This is Eminem."
55:28;55:29;"I can tell."
55:30;55:31;"What the hell?"
55:31;55:51;"No one listen to techno."
55:51;55:56;"That was bewildering."
55:56;55:58;"That was bewildering featuring Eminem."
56:00;56:06;"So, Alec, I don't think we've ever talked about Eminem on this show."
56:06;56:07;"All right."
56:07;56:10;"Now, you are also a Caucasian rapper."
56:10;56:11;"Yeah."
56:11;56:14;"A short Caucasian rapper."
56:14;56:15;"Is Eminem short?"
56:15;56:17;"No, not really."
56:17;56:18;"Just saying."
56:18;56:19;"Just making a distinction."
56:19;56:21;"Eminem's pretty tall and handsome as hell."
56:21;56:22;"Yeah."
56:22;56:23;"Actually, I have no idea."
56:23;56:25;"Okay, so what's your take on Eminem?"
56:25;56:29;"I want to hear the big picture, and then I want you to talk about this verse."
56:29;56:33;"I'll give you the big picture, and I'll make it as concise as I can."
56:33;56:37;"I went to an Eminem show at Tramps in 1999."
56:37;56:40;"He played with MF Doom and Pace One,"
56:40;56:44;"who was in the Outside Us, which was his crew from Jersey."
56:44;56:46;"He's not from Jersey, but his crew was."
56:46;56:48;"And I thought he was great."
56:48;56:54;"And it was 1999, and there wasn't a famous great white rapper, I guess,"
56:54;56:56;"since Vanilla Ice."
56:56;57:00;"And I was like, ""Oh, this is cool. This guy can rap. He's good."""
57:00;57:05;"And he was rapping in a way that in 1999, I liked."
57:05;57:06;"You know?"
57:06;57:10;"A very talented rapper, said a lot of curse words, was a bad guy,"
57:10;57:15;"seemed like a bad guy, told everyone else that they sucked and he was great,"
57:15;57:19;"which is what rap was all about at that moment."
57:19;57:23;"It's still about that kind of, but now it's more about I'm richer than you"
57:23;57:26;"and I kill more people, which I like better."
57:26;57:29;"The Weeknd Eminem remix gets an A+."
57:29;57:31;"I think it was trash."
57:31;57:32;"You thought it was trash?"
57:32;57:33;"Trash. Garbage."
57:33;57:38;"Okay. A+, Alec gives it a zero. That brings it down to an F."
57:38;57:45;"The next song, number two on the iTunes chart, is the same song without Eminem."
57:45;57:46;"Oh, jeez."
57:46;57:47;"Sick."
57:47;57:48;"Let's see if it's better."
57:48;57:50;"Ooh, it already sounds kind of better."
57:50;57:51;"Sorry, Em."
58:08;58:15;"The Weeknd is driving up to have this late night sex with this woman."
58:15;58:18;"Right, and Eminem's like, ""And I'm coming too!"""
58:18;58:23;"Eminem pops up in the back, hiding in the closet, and she's like,"
58:23;58:26;"""Abel, you didn't say you were bringing a friend."
58:26;58:29;"I thought this was more like a one-on-one special encounter."""
58:29;58:32;"""Why is he wearing that superhero costume?"""
58:32;58:34;"[Mimics music]"
58:34;58:37;"""You act like you've never seen a white person before."""
58:37;58:40;"Anyway, you know what I would like to see?"
58:40;58:43;"Just from a fan perspective, I would love to see an Eminem"
58:43;58:47;"and The Weeknd ""Watch the Throne"" type album."
58:47;58:50;"I'm going to say I would not like to see that."
58:50;58:52;"Alec, man, you're such a hater."
58:52;58:55;"I don't know. I feel like this is a million-dollar idea."
58:55;58:57;"How can I make this happen?"
58:57;58:59;"Well, you just put it out there on the airwaves."
58:59;59:02;"You just got to sit back and wait for those emails to roll in."
59:02;59:05;"You know, sometimes my life coach tells me that when you want something to happen,"
59:05;59:08;"you just got to put it out into the universe, and the universe will answer."
59:08;59:10;"You have to tell people that it's already happening."
59:12;59:14;"You just have to announce it on the radio."
59:14;59:20;"Mixtape is about to come out right before Coachella and Flushing Metal Park."
59:20;59:23;"Right before Queen's Coachella."
59:23;59:29;"I mean, like, at Queen's Coachella, the two kings of music--"
59:29;59:31;"[laughter]"
59:31;59:34;"I'm putting this out in the universe, guys. It's important."
59:34;59:38;"2016, right before Queen's Coachella, the two kings of music--"
59:38;59:41;"that's what I'm talking about. The Weeknd and Eminem dropped their mixtape."
59:41;59:43;"It's happening. You heard it here first."
59:43;59:46;"It's called ""On Time Crisis."""
59:46;59:49;"It's called ""You Act Like You've Never Seen--"""
59:49;59:52;"""You Act Like You've Never Seen a Duo Before."""
59:55;59:58;"Are you guys ready for the number one song on the charts right now?"
59:58;01:00:00;"Can't wait."
01:00:00;01:00:03;"This is a song by my favorite rapper,"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"who maybe has some questionable Halloween outfit choices,"
01:00:06;01:00:10;"but still, we can admit, is definitely one of the most fascinating cultural figures,"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"the greatest rapper, and an incredible hit maker."
01:00:12;01:00:16;"You know that Drake has had over 100 Billboard Top 100 singles?"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"- Really? - Yeah."
01:00:18;01:00:20;"That sounds like a--"
01:00:20;01:00:23;"It's not even that long a period of time. That's like an eighth of Eminem's career."
01:00:23;01:00:26;"Drake is the Beatles."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"Yeah. That's so prime for a rap line."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Like, 100, top 100 hits."
01:00:32;01:00:35;"I can't believe he hasn't even said it yet."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"I wonder if this is number 100. I don't know."
01:00:37;01:00:40;"But anyway, here is Drake with the number one song on iTunes right now."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"Great song, ""Hotline Bling."""

01:02:03;01:02:05;"Good song, great song. I like it."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"Now, a lot of people think that this is Drake"
01:02:07;01:02:10;"returning to his sad boy persona."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Talking about lost love."
01:02:12;01:02:16;"I guess he didn't do too much of that on the future mixtape."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"Didn't do too much of that on the--"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"if you're reading this, it's too late."
01:02:20;01:02:22;"That was mostly gloating. He was gloating a lot."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"Gloating. But there's a time to gloat"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"and there's a time to-- Be sad."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Be sad. Yeah."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"And Drake has mastered that."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"That's why he has 100-- top 100 singles."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"Yeah. I love sad Drake."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"All right, let's listen to the Spanish hotline bling."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Tell us about it, Alec."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"It's by this guy Fuego."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"Fuego, that means fire in Spanish."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"Yeah, and I like how he specifically"
01:02:44;01:02:47;"references the iPhone in his song,"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"whereas Drake talks about a cell phone."
01:02:50;01:02:53;"This guy keeps saying iPhone, and I like that."

01:08:28;01:08:31;"Today we have a very, very special guest,"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"dear friend, Mr. Jonah."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"What's up, Jonah?"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Thanks for coming, man."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- Hey, Ezra."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- How's it going?"
01:08:36;01:08:40;"- This is my first podcast with people I'm friends with."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"- This is not a podcast."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- So it's like weird."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"- This is not a podcast, my friend."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"- Well, we're not friends."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"- Frankly, it's debatable."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"- Yeah."
01:08:48;01:08:51;"- No, frankly, it's debatable because this is--"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"- Is that a legal thing or something?"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"- Yeah."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"- It's an Applecast?"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- It's--"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"(laughing)"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"I guess Apple invented the podcast."
01:08:59;01:09:00;"- Yeah, how did they not get that?"
01:09:00;01:09:01;"- It's post-podcast."
01:09:01;01:09:02;"We're in the post-podcast."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- Yeah, this is post-podcast."
01:09:03;01:09:05;"'Cause it used to be people would download"
01:09:05;01:09:09;"some two-hour MP3 to their iPod to listen to."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"- I'm downloading this straight to mini-disc."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"Well, we're very happy to have you here."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"- I'm happy to be here."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"- We've known you for years, know you're a big music fan."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"- Mm-hmm."
01:09:19;01:09:21;"- The first song that I think of when I think of you,"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"maybe you could guess, but I'm just gonna say it."
01:09:23;01:09:25;"- Wait, well, let me think."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"- What song that I would almost consider your anthem?"
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- I'm trying--"
01:09:29;01:09:30;"- I'll give you a hint."
01:09:30;01:09:31;"- Is it Selena?"
01:09:31;01:09:32;"(laughing)"
01:09:32;01:09:33;"- That did not cost my money."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"- Is it Kamala Floor?"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"- That's a great song, I love that song."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"It is from the '90s."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"- Oh, ""Souls of Mischief""?"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"- Warmer."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"- ""Far Side""?"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"- Warmer."
01:09:43;01:09:45;"- From the '90s."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"- It's somebody from the same town as you."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"- Oh, ""It Was a Good Day."""
01:09:48;01:09:49;"- ""It Was a Good Day."""
01:09:49;01:09:50;"- That's my favorite song of all time."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"- Yeah, exactly, exactly."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- Yeah, exactly, cool."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"- So here in honor of our special guest--"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"- Are you playing the remix?"

01:51:35;01:51:38;"I moved to Monaco, but now I can't relax."
01:51:38;01:51:39;"I hate myself."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"I think Americans are whack."
01:51:41;01:51:46;"But other countries leave me feeling weird like afternoon naps."
01:51:46;01:51:48;"Summer 2014."
01:51:48;01:51:56;"Shmoney dancing with some goth teens."
01:51:56;01:52:02;"Mother of the leaking news."
01:52:07;01:52:10;"Why they gotta be so brutal?"
01:52:10;01:52:14;"I lost my summer."
01:52:14;01:52:17;"I feel like a frisky, a-roaning."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"And now my only friends are Jeff, Bart, and McConaughey."
01:52:20;01:52:23;"Gonna spend the fall buying Jack and Sattermont."
01:52:23;01:52:28;"Gonna spend the winter frisky and frozen in a pistol ball."
01:52:28;01:52:31;"Went to the Hamptons and I thought I was the man."
01:52:35;01:52:38;"Till Mary-Kate said my Ray-Bans were off-brand."
01:52:38;01:52:45;"I kept my mouth shut and I shook Sarkozy's hand."
01:52:45;01:52:52;"Spit in the ocean, stole a handful of his sand."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"Dang, dang."
01:52:54;01:52:58;"I'm 'bout to write these old rooms."
01:52:58;01:53:02;"But not until I get a few mil."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"And I've been counting so long."
01:53:05;01:53:09;"Them dead presidents and skeletons on new builds."
01:53:09;01:53:12;"Up on the block again but down on my luck."
01:53:12;01:53:15;"If you buyin' I got whatever I can sell for a buck."
01:53:15;01:53:18;"And I got it for so cheap you think it fell off a truck."
01:53:18;01:53:22;"Now them pockets is so deep they tried to run 'em and sunk."
01:53:22;01:53:25;"Rocks and socks I got cold feet but still married."
01:53:25;01:53:28;"The game I'm stuck so I'm dodging the police."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"I'm out here running, ducking cuffs."
01:53:30;01:53:33;"I ain't getting any sleep, these mother****** gon' keep me up."
01:53:33;01:53:36;"Didn't know what day it was until the club was going up."
01:53:36;01:53:39;"I ain't slept a wink, my brain's on the blink."
01:53:39;01:53:43;"The fizz in my drink got a strange tint of pink."
01:53:43;01:53:46;"It's all getting f***ed down the drain in the sink."
01:53:46;01:53:50;"It is what it is but it ain't what you think."
01:53:50;01:53:54;"Put a price tag on your life, going once, going twice."
01:53:54;01:53:57;"Go bust off the culture site and blame it on the poltergeist."
01:53:57;01:54:01;"Alibis is golden so I fold 'em like it's polka night."
01:54:01;01:54:04;"Got the whistle blowers tight like I just gon' smoke just right."
01:54:04;01:54:08;"Birds is chirping perfect 'til I shoot 'em out the sky in flight."
01:54:08;01:54:11;"Chop 'em up and serve 'em on your turf, you know you heard me right."
01:54:11;01:54:15;"Got away with words, you lucky you got away with your life."
01:54:15;01:54:19;"Not afraid to burn a bridge, it's shady I can use the light."
01:54:19;01:54:23;"Now everybody's on one."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"I'm trying to get 'em on at least two."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"Keep saying it's your last one."
01:54:29;01:54:33;"Nobody's ever gon' believe you."
01:54:33;01:54:36;"But I've been down for so long."
01:54:36;01:54:40;"And I've been keeping it too real."
01:54:40;01:54:43;"Yeah, I've been keeping it too real."
01:54:43;01:54:47;"Yeah, I've been keeping it too real."
01:54:47;01:54:50;"So I'ma say what I want."
01:54:54;01:54:57;"And I don't care how you feel."
01:54:57;01:55:01;"No, I don't care how you feel."
01:55:11;01:55:14;"That was Olive Maconan, ""Down for So Long."""
01:55:14;01:55:16;"I'm on it and so is Despot."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Thank you so much for having us on your remix."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"And thank you, Jonah."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"And it's one of my favorite songs, everybody involved here."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"Thank you for playing it so much."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"And I'm doing the video for it."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"Yes, you're doing the video."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Okay, we just hired you."
01:55:25;01:55:29;"So the next six months of my life are dedicated to directing music videos"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"'cause I'm directing my first movie in the new year."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Okay, in 2016."
01:55:33;01:55:38;"In 2016, so I'm only going to--which Ezra's Red, the movie that I wrote."
01:55:38;01:55:44;"Watch me get this budget from Red Bull live on the air now that Jonah Hill's dead."
01:55:44;01:55:46;"No, but for real, before I direct a movie in six months,"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"I'm going to do as many music videos as I can."
01:55:48;01:55:51;"So I only want to do it for songs that I love and people that I'm friends with."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"You got any on deck yet?"
01:55:53;01:55:54;"Anything you can talk about?"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"The list is very small."
01:55:55;01:56:00;"It's like you, you, you, A$AP Rocky."
01:56:00;01:56:04;"It's like a very small list of people I wanted--or Action Bronson is someone I--"
01:56:04;01:56:07;"was going to maybe do the Baby Blue video,"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"but then I had to go in production on a movie."
01:56:09;01:56:12;"But it's only going to be people who I love their music"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"and want to make a short film with them."
01:56:14;01:56:16;"This is the music video year."
01:56:16;01:56:17;"Yeah."
01:56:17;01:56:18;"I'll show you my list."
01:56:18;01:56:21;"There's like 12 people on it, and three of them are in this room."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"And Action's one of them."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"That's cool."
01:56:23;01:56:26;"I know, Action--"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"You want to call Action?"
01:56:27;01:56:29;"There's [bleep] in Action, man."
01:56:29;01:56:30;"That's all right."
01:56:30;01:56:32;"I'm sorry, man."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"You got to get in the studio, Action."
01:56:34;01:56:36;"[Bleep] I got all sorts of videos."
01:56:36;01:56:40;"So this is going to be a big music video year for our man Jonah Hill."
01:56:40;01:56:41;"That sounds like--"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"Fire."
01:56:42;01:56:43;"Can't wait to see him."
01:56:43;01:56:47;"Sounds like water."
01:56:47;01:56:48;"That sounds like--"
01:56:48;01:56:51;"Anarchy that can hear no evil."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"I'll tell you, man, when I heard that Jonah was going to make our video,"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"I was--"
01:56:54;01:56:57;"A happy face with sunglasses."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"I'm definitely doing a VW video."
01:56:59;01:57:00;"You know that."
01:57:00;01:57:01;"That'd be tight."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"Honestly, it's hard to find good video directors these days."
01:57:04;01:57:08;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:57:08;01:57:12;"Beats 1."
01:57:19;01:57:23;"Many times I tried to tell you"
01:57:23;01:57:26;"Many times I cried alone"
01:57:26;01:57:33;"Always unsurprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone"
01:57:33;01:57:37;"Don't want to leave you, really"
01:57:37;01:57:40;"I've missed too much time"
01:57:40;01:57:44;"To give you up that easy"
01:57:44;01:57:48;"To the doubts that complicate your mind"
01:57:48;01:57:50;"We belong to the light"
01:57:50;01:57:54;"We belong to the thunder"
01:57:54;01:57:57;"We belong to the sound of the words"
01:57:57;01:58:01;"Before falling under"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"Whenever we deny all the grace"
01:58:04;01:58:07;"The worse or for better"
01:58:07;01:58:10;"We belong"
01:58:10;01:58:15;"We belong together"
01:58:15;01:58:19;"Maybe it's a sign of weakness"
01:58:19;01:58:22;"When I don't know what to say"
01:58:22;01:58:29;"Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway"
01:58:29;01:58:33;"Have we become a habit"
01:58:33;01:58:36;"To wait to start the fight"
01:58:36;01:58:40;"Now there's no looking forward"
01:58:40;01:58:43;"Now there's no turning back"
01:58:43;01:58:46;"When you say we belong to the light"
01:58:46;01:58:49;"We belong to the thunder"
01:58:49;01:58:53;"We belong to the sound of the words"

01:59:08;01:59:11;"We belong together"
01:59:11;01:59:23;"Close your eyes and try to sleep now"
01:59:23;01:59:27;"Close your eyes and try to dream"
01:59:27;01:59:31;"Leave a plan and do your best to try"
01:59:31;01:59:34;"To watch the battle gleam"
01:59:34;01:59:38;"We can begin to know"
01:59:38;01:59:41;"How much we really care"
01:59:41;01:59:45;"I hear your voice inside me"
01:59:45;01:59:48;"I see your face everywhere"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"Till you say we belong to the light"
01:59:50;01:59:54;"We belong to the thunder"
01:59:54;01:59:58;"We belong to the sound of the words"
