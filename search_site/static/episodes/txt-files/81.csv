00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis back again. Guess what TC heads? I finally saw a Star is Born. I"
00:07;00:13;"stepped into the SCBoo and I left a piece of my heart there. On this week's"
00:13;00:19;"episode we get some great fan submissions. We read an email from Beto O'Rourke"
00:19;00:24;"that I thought was a personal one but went out to millions of people and we"
00:24;00:34;"also count on the top hits of today in 1991. This is Time Crisis with Eds M. Kaden."
00:34;00:40;"Peace. One."
00:40;01:10;"All of those great romances, you were a friend to a belief, all my rightful chances. My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:20;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying. Leave it on me babe."
01:20;01:39;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. How are the Joker Man rehearsals going? I was just telling Jake that we've been working on a pretty good cover of Joker Man. Full version? All the verses? Yeah, plus some of our own fun stuff. We did a version, I was just listening to it, we had one version of Joker Man that's a little bit different."
01:39;01:58;"That's 11 minutes. That's what I want to hear. I know, I know that's what you want. Does this include solos? Yeah, although it wasn't, it's not too noodley actually. Right, because the original was like what, six or seven? The original's already six, so you start adding in some instrumental moments, it gets long."
01:58;02:27;"Are you transitioning into Joker Man, or are you just starting it cold? We start it cold, it's Joker Man. Yeah, it's Joker Man. It's pretty faithful at first, and you know, you'll see. Jake, I finally have joined you as somebody who has seen A Star is Born. Congratulations. We've been talking a lot about this. A Star is Born, before the show, somebody was saying A Star is Born may almost be the new Ed Sheeran shape of you for the show. It's just inescapable, on the charts."
02:27;02:52;"And we'll be talking about it, one of the Oscars, February, March, whatever. Yeah, yeah. So we'll be talking about it between now and that period at least, another three, four months. Well into 2019. We just heard that Bradley Cooper said he's got something special planned for the live performance of Shallow. You know what I think it is? He'll be hammered. I'm just going to get sh*t-faced. I think he's going to do an 11 minute Shallow."
02:52;03:18;"The Oscars infamously strict, trying to get people off stage. The speech is running long. Bradley just rolls up with Bob Weir. You know what would be sick? Launch into it. The network freaks out. They cut the ad. They come back. Still going. At that point, they transition into Jack Straw. Shallow, Arrow, Jack Straw. They recreate that early 70s, 42 minute playing in the band with Shallow just in the middle."
03:18;03:44;"It's my dream. I went to a special screening of A Star is Born. Okay. It's been out for months. I know. That's the hilarious part. Basically, a friend of Time Crisis, Mark Ronson, who's one of the writers of Shallow, hosted a screening. Oh, cool. And I was like, Ted, I haven't seen it yet. Most people had seen it, but whatever. It was cool to go see it. So the screening was sponsored by the studio, whoever made it."
03:44;04:09;"So when I walked in, there were some people from the studio, from the film company. And before you sat down, they said, do you want a t-shirt? And they had them all laid out. And we've talked about A Star is Born merch on this show before. Because if you go online, you can find very realistic A Star is Born merch. That's like a real Jackson Maine. Yeah. Who's the character shirt or you can get an Ali shirt."
04:09;04:28;"Louisville, Kentucky show 2009. Yeah, exactly. And there was like an even deeper one that was like Maine Brothers 95. Like, that's like so obscure, even within the A Star is Born universe, aka the S-E-Boo. So I was kind of excited. Maybe it's gonna be one of those Jackson Maine shirts or an Ali shirt. And I could give it to Jake to wear in public."
04:28;04:48;"That would be a real test. A test of your fandom. But I could tell as I approached, it wasn't quite that. It's a black t-shirt, kind of over the left breast. It says A Star is Born. And I'm like, all right, it's a little boring. And then I get closer and they're all v-necks. Wow. It's rough stuff, folks."
04:48;05:15;"Which is so weird. Although I guess fitting for A Star is Born because probably Bradley Cooper's character is the type of dude who I don't know if he wears them in the movie, but he's the type of guy who might wear a v-neck. I could see him pulling it off. Not that there's only one type of guy who wears a v-neck, but he's a type of guy who'd wear a v-neck, which is the kind of because there's the kind of like Jersey Shore v-neck. And this is more like the rugged v-neck. Anyway, so now I have A Star is Born v-neck t-shirt."
05:15;05:38;"Will you wear it publicly? Maybe. What context? I don't wear v-necks that often. And we were talking a little bit before the show just about v-necks period. I think v-necks have gotten a bad reputation over the past 10 years. Whereas I think back in the day, like a v-neck was like the kind of shirt that like a chilled out dude would wear. Am I wrong here?"
05:38;05:52;"I don't know. What's the origin of the v-neck? Is it something you'd wear under a button down shirt so you don't get the, you know, if you like wear a t-shirt and you have like a button down shirt and then if you, but like if you don't button it all the way to the top, you'd see the t-shirt underneath."
05:52;06:19;"I've always found that a t-shirt under a unbuttoned dress shirt is such a dorky look. It's a terrible look. That was one of my main things in early Vampire Weekend because we always wore like dress shirts, button downs. I'd always be like, well, can't wear t-shirts. I put my foot down about that. But I kind of feel like a chilled out dude would have worn just like a white v-neck. Because if back in the day it was considered like an undershirt and you're just like a chilled out dude, you threw that on in a pair of jeans. I'm talking like 70s."
06:19;06:28;"Somebody probably look at you and be like, that's a chilled out dude. He's not trying too hard. Whereas at some point it flipped and a v-neck became the opposite. It became trying too hard."
06:28;06:29;"It's a statement."
06:29;06:37;"And then also people found the concept of the deep v especially humorous. Do you remember everybody thought deep v's were so funny?"
06:37;06:39;"I don't. I miss this."
06:39;06:40;"Maybe just in my circle."
06:40;06:40;"Yeah."
06:40;06:44;"I feel like, I don't know, there might've been some sketch or some comedian."
06:44;06:45;"There was a sketch. There was an SNL."
06:45;06:46;"What was it?"
06:46;06:51;"Ben Stiller doing them. There was a double v. There was a v that went down to the belly button."
06:51;06:52;"And they would just keep getting deeper and deeper."
06:52;06:53;"That's right."
06:53;06:57;"And the implication was the deeper the v, the more of a douchebag a guy was?"
06:57;06:58;"Sure. Yeah."
06:59;07:01;"When I was still growing up"
07:01;07:05;"And dad had off to work"
07:05;07:10;"He'd put a coat and tie on"
07:10;07:14;"Of a fitted shirt"
07:14;07:19;"Nothing else would fit right"
07:19;07:24;"Or seem so directly applied"
07:27;07:29;"A fitted shirt hung on me"
07:29;07:33;"Fitted shirt, all right"
07:33;07:40;"I long for the days they used to say"
07:40;07:42;"Ma'am and yes sir"
07:42;07:47;"For now I'm going to find"
07:47;07:52;"Buttons for my dad's old used shirt"
07:55;08:01;"Fitted shirt, fitted shirt"
08:01;08:05;"So what's going to happen with the, um, Star is Born black v?"
08:05;08:06;"Well, I could"
08:06;08:07;"Bottom of the t-shirt drawer"
08:07;08:08;"I could wear it to exercise"
08:08;08:11;"I could wear it to sleep"
08:11;08:13;"You change tees for sleeping?"
08:13;08:16;"Not usually, only if it's like very cold"
08:16;08:19;"Usually shirtless or just the shirt you're wearing that day?"
08:19;08:21;"Usually shirtless. I get kind of overheated."
08:21;08:24;"What about you? You wear the one that you've been wearing all day?"
08:24;08:29;"Usually. I have a feeling that people are probably listening saying these guys are a couple dirtbags."
08:29;08:33;"Two-thirds of the time I'm just going to bed with the shirt I wore that day"
08:33;08:34;"because I'm a morning shower guy."
08:34;08:38;"Oh yeah, as am I, but I still think people are probably listening"
08:38;08:41;"thinking that we're a couple dirtbags, a couple deep v dirtbags."
08:41;08:42;"I mean, if I'm-"
08:42;08:45;"Is this what normal people do? That they wear a t-shirt all day,"
08:45;08:48;"they didn't particularly break a sweat because they work in data management,"
08:48;08:52;"and they come home, watch some tv, eat dinner,"
08:52;08:53;"Shirt's still on."
08:53;08:58;"Shirt's still on, then it's like time for bed, take off their jeans,"
08:58;09:02;"and then take off the t-shirt too, and go into another drawer,"
09:02;09:05;"and say like, ""Mmm, what would be a good PJ shirt to wear?"""
09:05;09:05;"I do that."
09:05;09:06;"That's what you do, Seinfeld?"
09:06;09:07;"That's my routine."
09:07;09:11;"Is that a Canadian thing or that's just what normal people across-"
09:11;09:13;"I don't know about normal, but I-"
09:13;09:15;"So what happens with that t-shirt in the next morning?"
09:15;09:16;"The pajama t-shirt?"
09:16;09:20;"Yeah. Is that tomorrow night's pajama t-shirt or is that just a one-off?"
09:20;09:23;"That's a night shirt, and then I'm showering and I'm going into another shirt."
09:23;09:25;"So it's going in the hamper."
09:25;09:26;"It's going in the hamper."
09:26;09:26;"Wait, so you-"
09:26;09:28;"Every day you wear two t-shirts?"
09:28;09:30;"Yes, sometimes three."
09:30;09:32;"So you're doing 14 to 21 t-shirts a week?"
09:32;09:36;"Yeah, I suppose. Well, I mean, I guess I'm washing,"
09:36;09:38;"probably some of those shirts are in the cycle."
09:38;09:43;"So you'll just sleep in a shirt from like 11 p.m. to like 7 a.m."
09:43;09:44;"Yeah."
09:44;09:48;"And the AC is on in your place, it's a very completely reasonable temperature."
09:48;09:49;"Yeah, you know what, even with the AC-"
09:49;09:50;"You're not breaking a sweat?"
09:50;09:51;"I'm still sweating."
09:51;09:54;"Even with the AC on, I'm still kind of sweating overnight."
09:54;09:56;"But don't you ever be like, ""You know what? I'm just going to set-"
09:56;09:59;"I'm going to take the t-shirt off at 7 a.m., the alarm goes off."
09:59;10:03;"I'm going to fold the t-shirt, set it on the bed, I'm going to wear it tomorrow night."""
10:03;10:05;"No, because that t-shirt's been sweated in."
10:05;10:07;"But just put it on tomorrow night."
10:07;10:08;"But then it's like salty."
10:08;10:14;"Are there very clear-cut boundaries about your day versus night t-shirts?"
10:14;10:17;"Yeah, because the night t-shirts are like what you've just described, like old-"
10:18;10:19;"You know-"
10:19;10:20;"Aimee and a Cape Cod."
10:20;10:20;"They've got holes in them."
10:20;10:23;"All the TC merch."
10:23;10:25;"That's why we've been making the merch."
10:25;10:29;"No, they're just old, like, you know, sloppy shirts that are from like 15 years ago"
10:29;10:34;"that I used to wear during the day and have now been demoted to the night."
10:34;10:34;"Wow."
10:34;10:35;"Yeah, like-"
10:35;10:39;"And that AC boot shirt, that would have been like a good candidate for like a night shirt."
10:39;10:40;"Straight to the night shirt."
10:40;10:42;"Not even consideration for the day."
10:42;10:46;"Well, I think that, Ezra, what you might want to do is do a little modification"
10:46;10:47;"and make it a scoop neck."
10:48;10:51;"Get some scissors, convert that V to a scoop."
10:51;10:54;"Now you've got like a cool DIY kind of raggedy-"
10:54;10:57;"You know, I think maybe I should just start wearing it."
10:57;11:01;"You know, they say you gotta like be the change you want to see in the world."
11:01;11:11;"I wish I was the type of chilled out dude who would go to a screening of A Star is Born,"
11:11;11:16;"get a free V-neck shirt, and then just like wear it to a party that week."
11:16;11:17;"Just rock it."
11:17;11:21;"And somebody be like, ""Whoa, A Star is Born V-neck, did you buy that?"""
11:21;11:22;"And be like, ""No, I went to a screening."
11:22;11:24;"They were giving them away."""
11:24;11:26;"Well, are you like really into the movie?"
11:26;11:27;"It was good."
11:27;11:28;"I mean, they were giving them away."
11:28;11:30;"Do you think that's a cool shirt?"
11:30;11:31;"I didn't really think about it."
11:31;11:32;"It's a free shirt."
11:32;11:34;"Yeah, it's a free shirt."
11:34;11:36;"Are you being ironic?"
11:36;11:39;"I just told you, I saw the movie, I liked it, and they gave the shirt away."
11:39;11:41;"I didn't buy it, but you know, whatever."
11:41;11:42;"It's a shirt."
11:42;11:43;"I wish I was that chilled out."
11:43;11:44;"That is inspiring, actually."
11:44;11:48;"Yeah, just picture that dude, and they're just like, ""No, bro, like sit down."""
11:48;11:50;"You're making fun of A Star is Born right now?"
11:50;11:51;"It's a good movie."
11:51;11:53;"I mean, it's probably going to win some Oscars."
11:53;11:54;"What are you talking about?"
11:54;11:56;"That would be a fun shirt to wear at an Oscar party though or something,"
11:56;11:59;"or if you're chilling at home, maybe watching the Oscars, you wear that shirt."
11:59;12:02;"You feel like you're kind of connected to the film."
12:02;12:03;"That's true."
12:03;12:04;"Wear it to the Oscars."
12:04;12:09;"I think you have to wear a tuxedo to the Oscars."
12:09;12:13;"I want to borrow the shirt from you, and I want to wear it for a few days."
12:14;12:15;"Just in my daily routine."
12:15;12:17;"I'll report back."
12:17;12:18;"I want to see how it feels."
12:18;12:19;"Do you remember there was a--"
12:19;12:22;"they always do these kind of like undercover videos."
12:22;12:27;"Like there was one about catcalling to show non-women what it's like for a woman walking"
12:27;12:29;"the streets in New York City getting catcalled all day."
12:29;12:32;"We could do one where like Seinfeld follows you with like a secret camera,"
12:32;12:38;"just like Jake walking on the streets of Los Angeles wearing a A Star is Born shirt."
12:38;12:39;"Just to see what happens."
12:39;12:41;"Real slice of life."
12:42;12:51;"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay against your skin so brown."
12:51;13:05;"And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight with a billion stars all around."
13:07;13:18;"'Cause I got a peaceful, easy feeling that I know you won't let me down."
13:18;13:28;"'Cause I'm all that is standing on the ground."
13:28;13:36;"I've definitely rocked pretty innocuous free t-shirts in my life."
13:36;13:38;"Oh yeah, right now Jake is wearing a--"
13:38;13:39;"A black Polar Fleece."
13:39;13:43;"A Pagodna Polar Fleece, but it's branded on the side as a Showtime documentary films."
13:43;13:46;"I have no idea what this is from."
13:46;13:46;"Oh, you weren't at an event?"
13:46;13:47;"This just showed up."
13:47;13:48;"No."
13:48;13:50;"I mean, I think maybe Hannah got this at Sundance one year."
13:50;13:51;"Yeah."
13:51;13:52;"And this was just in our house."
13:52;13:55;"And then it was in my studio and it got cold today."
13:55;13:58;"And I was just like, I was digging around in this pile of clothes in the"
13:58;14:00;"corner of the studio and I found it and I put it on."
14:00;14:02;"No idea what the backstory is."
14:02;14:05;"But this is innocuous enough that I would just wear this in public"
14:05;14:06;"and feel free about it."
14:06;14:07;"Yeah, it's chill."
14:07;14:13;"A V-neck black Star is Born t-shirt is really like throwing a flag up."
14:13;14:18;"I guess I found it so unusual that they were giving away V-necks because"
14:18;14:20;"it's not exactly considered a neutral shirt."
14:20;14:20;"Right."
14:20;14:21;"You know what I mean?"
14:21;14:26;"I think if somebody saw just like a regular black t-shirt that said a Star is Born,"
14:26;14:30;"especially in LA, they might look at you and be like, okay, maybe this guy's a grip."
14:30;14:33;"He was a grip on, you know, a Star is Born."
14:33;14:34;"I want to try this."
14:34;14:36;"Maybe this guy was a caterer."
14:36;14:37;"He was a caterer."
14:37;14:38;"He was in the room with Gaga."
14:38;14:39;"He was one of the 99."
14:39;14:41;"Yeah, right."
14:41;14:44;"He was one of the gaffers who didn't believe in her."
14:44;14:45;"But he did believe in her."
14:45;14:48;"He felt bad that she said that."
14:48;14:48;"Right."
14:48;14:51;"He didn't want to overstep and tell her that he did believe in her."
14:51;14:56;"I was wearing my Father's Day weekend shirt today."
14:56;14:58;"Yeah, I can see it kind of under the fleece."
14:58;15:05;"My Vampire Weekend long sleeve, white long sleeve tee from the Ohi shows this summer."
15:05;15:06;"Which is a coveted shirt now."
15:06;15:08;"Yeah, it's a great shirt."
15:08;15:10;"And when I wear it out, it gets a lot of eyeballs."
15:10;15:13;"And I actually got two different comments today about it."
15:13;15:14;"And do people know what it is?"
15:14;15:15;"Because it doesn't say Vampire Weekend."
15:15;15:16;"Okay."
15:16;15:17;"Or it says Vampire Weekend on the back."
15:17;15:19;"I have two stories just from today."
15:19;15:20;"Whoa."
15:20;15:23;"The first story was I went into the gym about 8 a.m."
15:23;15:23;"Yeah."
15:23;15:24;"Wearing that."
15:24;15:27;"And one of the trainers that works there was like, what is that?"
15:27;15:28;"Father's Day weekend?"
15:28;15:31;"I was like, oh, it's just this weird concert shirt."
15:31;15:32;"He's like, are you a father?"
15:32;15:34;"I was like, no, that is weird."
15:34;15:38;"End of that conversation."
15:38;15:44;"And then a few hours later, I was dipping into the local coffee shop, waiting on the"
15:44;15:44;"iced coffee."
15:44;15:50;"And the guy on the counter was like, hey, did you see Ezra's going to be at the GQ festival?"
15:50;15:51;"Talking about LP4."
15:51;15:51;"Oh, really?"
15:51;15:53;"I was like, no, what's that?"
15:53;15:54;"I don't, is that here?"
15:54;15:55;"What is that?"
15:55;15:56;"I mean, I know what GQ is."
15:57;15:58;"The GQ festival."
15:58;16:00;"He's like, so he saw the shirt."
16:00;16:01;"Oh, that's tight."
16:01;16:02;"I don't think he even saw the back."
16:02;16:03;"He just saw the Father's Day weekend."
16:03;16:07;"I mean, he's pretty dialed in if he knows that I'm going to be at the GQ thing."
16:07;16:09;"So he probably recognized the shirt, I would guess."
16:09;16:09;"Yeah."
16:09;16:14;"Yeah, I got like a DM or something from somebody who was like, that O'Hai's show, which was"
16:14;16:17;"with Richard Pictures that produced a few classic shirts."
16:17;16:22;"Your guy's shirt, the one that Kyle Field made, the bringing out your dead one, this"
16:22;16:22;"one."
16:22;16:24;"Yeah, I got that DM or somebody who was like."
16:24;16:25;"Maybe they're at Cape Cod."
16:25;16:30;"Who is like, I'd really love to, um, like, it's like, it's a grail shirt, as they say."
16:30;16:31;"Grail?"
16:31;16:37;"That's what like kind of streetwear collector types would be like some really coveted rare"
16:37;16:39;"item."
16:39;16:40;"I knew it when I saw it."
16:40;16:42;"I was like, that is a solid shirt."
16:42;16:44;"I remember that Sunday morning."
16:44;16:45;"Because like, we can't just keep selling it."
16:45;16:47;"It's only for Father's Day weekend."
16:47;16:48;"It's a specific show shirt."
16:48;16:50;"I remember when I saw them, I was like, I need to get one."
16:50;16:55;"And then Sunday morning of that weekend, I remember like making a point of like finding"
16:55;16:57;"the merch person and like grabbing one."
16:57;16:57;"Yeah."
16:57;16:59;"And then by the end of the show, gone."
16:59;17:00;"Yeah."
17:00;17:02;"We killed it with the merch at the O'Hai shows."
17:02;17:08;"I was wearing that eight minute Cape Cod tie dye shirt in Hawaii this summer."
17:08;17:12;"And someone like ran across a field, like spotted it from a distance."
17:12;17:14;"It was like, Vampire Weekend."
17:14;17:15;"Like, TC?"
17:15;17:16;"I love the."
17:16;17:16;"Yeah."
17:16;17:16;"I love it."
17:16;17:18;"Were they adapted on TC?"
17:18;17:19;"I didn't ask."
17:19;17:19;"I think probably."
17:19;17:21;"Because that's a TC thing."
17:21;17:21;"Yeah."
17:21;17:24;"You guys are listening to T-Shirt Talk, a new podcast."
17:24;17:25;"Merch Talk."
17:25;17:28;"From the Time Crisis family of podcasts."
17:28;17:33;"Brought to you by Sweet Martha's cookie jar."
17:33;17:34;"We have to start like."
17:34;17:39;"Just, the first 40 minutes of the show, he's just talking about merch."
17:39;17:41;"We gotta start."
17:41;17:43;"Just a shameless plug."
17:43;17:46;"It's the TCU."
17:46;17:48;"You know, it's like Pod Save America."
17:48;17:51;"Everybody has like a podcast network now."
17:51;17:51;"Yeah."
17:51;17:52;"Time Crisis has a start."
17:52;17:53;"Crooked media."
17:53;17:54;"Crooked media."
17:54;17:56;"We gotta start branching out."
17:56;17:57;"Time Crisis Media."
17:57;17:58;"And we're doing."
17:58;18:00;"Yeah, what's our media company name?"
18:00;18:00;"Because here's the thing."
18:00;18:01;"Just TCU Media?"
18:01;18:03;"Maybe just TCU."
18:03;18:06;"Because we're giving the fans too much good content under one umbrella."
18:06;18:10;"We gotta start diluting, diluting this."
18:10;18:15;"If you're into T-shirts, you gotta start paying the T-Shirt Talk Patreon."
18:15;18:17;"If you want to hear about Tasteful Palate."
18:17;18:17;"Well, guess what?"
18:17;18:19;"We're not talking about Time Crisis anymore."
18:19;18:20;"That's a separate pod."
18:20;18:23;"You gotta sign up for the Tasteful Palate pod."
18:23;18:24;"The TPP."
18:24;18:25;"That is a minimum $5 a month."
18:25;18:26;"That's a minimum $5."
18:26;18:28;"For each pod."
18:28;18:32;"Now you're guaranteed at least 120 minutes of content per month."
18:32;18:33;"That's right."
18:33;18:36;"Ooh, what about like a Jake, like a Bob Ross style?"
18:36;18:38;"Where like, you're like narrating your painting."
18:38;18:39;"But it's a podcast."
18:39;18:40;"Yeah, but it's a podcast."
18:40;18:41;"Oh, that's a good idea."
18:41;18:43;"That's a good idea."
18:43;18:46;"So I'm mixing the titanium white."
18:46;18:50;"Now that is a Gamblin Fast Matte White."
18:50;18:51;"Now I'm going to dilute that."
18:51;18:56;"I'm going to, what I'm going to do is put it out about four ounces of the titanium white."
18:56;18:59;"And then maybe a half ounce of the Gamsol solvent."
18:59;19:01;"Now I'm going to take the palette knife and just mix that in."
19:01;19:01;"You see that."
19:01;19:07;"You know what else is, Jake always listens to podcasts while he's painting."
19:07;19:10;"So just another podcast blaring in the background."
19:10;19:15;"Like you go quiet for a second and you just hear like Chavo Trap House blaring."
19:15;19:16;"Oh my God."
19:16;19:19;"You're just kind of murmuring to yourself like, hmm."
19:19;19:19;"All right."
19:19;19:22;"New episode of the Brett Easton Ellis podcast dropped today."
19:22;19:24;"I'm going to be playing that in the background."
19:24;19:26;"Mark Marin asked a hard hitting question."
19:26;19:28;"You're like, that's a pretty good one, Mark."
19:28;19:30;"Bro, save politics, dude."
19:30;19:35;"We've always talked about doing time crisis live events and we probably will at some point."
19:35;19:36;"Great."
19:36;19:37;"We definitely should."
19:37;19:39;"And we got to do special merch for those."
19:39;19:45;"We got to make some kind of TC merch that I think that's a Jake shirt if you're down for it."
19:45;19:45;"Yeah."
19:45;19:49;"I just want to see, it literally could just be like a screenshot of your Wikipedia."
19:49;19:53;"I just want a piece of merch that says American painter and radio personality."
19:53;19:54;"Yeah, that's good."
19:54;19:57;"Or Jake Longsworth is an American painter and radio personality."
19:57;20:00;"Like a photo, like a cool photo of me or something."
20:00;20:05;"And then on the back it says American painter and radio personality."
20:05;20:09;"A photo of you wearing the eight minute Cape Cod new black long sleeve."
20:09;20:10;"Yes."
20:10;20:12;"And then the back American painter radio personality."
20:12;20:13;"That's a strong shirt."
20:13;20:18;"♪ Randall's painter died last night ♪"
20:18;20:22;"♪ His painting's on the wall ♪"

21:06;21:10;"By the way, Seinfeld, since we're doing a t-shirt talk episode today,"
21:10;21:14;"you did kind of like a contest on Twitter for the black eight minute Cape Cod long sleeves."
21:14;21:15;"I did, yeah."
21:15;21:19;"And I'll tweet the winners, you know, as I speak right now."
21:19;21:19;"Okay."
21:19;21:21;"So while you're listening, you're gonna see who won."
21:21;21:24;"Because I was dipping into check and I like noticed that"
21:24;21:27;"contests seem to have like a very nice organic growth"
21:27;21:31;"where people went from just tweeting a sentence or two at you"
21:31;21:35;"to writing like poetry and things of that nature."
21:35;21:37;"Yeah, they really brought the notes app out."
21:37;21:42;"People were doing collages of all the TCU stuff."
21:42;21:43;"A lot of really good stuff in there."
21:43;21:47;"Someone did a Steve Miller tribute song, Patrick."
21:47;21:47;"Patrick who did the..."
21:47;21:49;"Oh, we have to get to that."
21:49;21:50;"Yeah, we should get into that."
21:50;21:52;"They have a very creative Crisis crew."
21:52;21:55;"Should we just get into that Patrick real fast while we're just thinking of it?"
21:55;21:56;"Otherwise, we might forget."
21:56;21:58;"So Patrick and this is..."
21:58;21:59;"Patrick World."
21:59;22:05;"And this is the same Patrick who made that Machine Gun Kelly style diss track."
22:05;22:06;"That's right."
22:06;22:06;"Towards me."
22:06;22:08;"Patrick World from Montreal."
22:08;22:08;"Oh, really?"
22:08;22:10;"Oh, that's cool."
22:10;22:14;"So Patrick World made a new song and this one is aimed at Steve Miller."
22:14;22:16;"And I'd like to point out we're talking about the musician."
22:16;22:18;"There's a few people named Steve Miller."
22:18;22:21;"We're talking about the musician who had Steve Miller band."
22:21;22:22;"Enemy of the show."
22:22;22:26;"As all TC heads will recall, but maybe some people are new to the show are working backwards."
22:26;22:31;"We've taken quite an issue with Mr. Miller after we uncovered that"
22:32;22:37;"despite having played with the Grateful Dead off and on over the decades from the 60s"
22:37;22:43;"all the way through the 90s as recent as the 92 or was the 91 opening for them."
22:43;22:44;"92."
22:44;22:46;"92 and even sitting in with them."
22:46;22:50;"After Jerry Garcia died, Steve Miller started running his mouth."
22:50;22:52;"So anyway, we're very offended by that."
22:52;22:58;"And I guess so is Patrick World because he's made a song which we're listening to the first time."
22:58;22:58;"Just like you are."
22:58;23:00;"Hopefully it's appropriate."
23:00;23:01;"It's called He Dissed the Dead."
23:03;23:05;"Time Crisis."
23:05;23:07;"This is the Time Crisis."
23:07;23:08;"Sweet Chili Heat."

24:03;24:06;"- What did he say, lied like a weasel?"
24:06;24:08;"♫ Lied like a weasel"
24:08;24:10;"- Nick, what's that Steve Miller song"
24:10;24:11;"you played a few weeks ago"
24:11;24:13;"that's like your favorite Steve Miller song?"
24:13;24:14;"- Serenade."
24:14;24:15;"- Guys, throw that song on."
24:15;24:16;"That song is so dope."

24:25;24:26;"- Let's listen to this for a sec, 'cause this"

25:54;25:55;"♫ As it blew"
25:55;25:57;"- Alright, it's a pretty good song."
25:57;26:00;"We never said that Steve Miller's music was trash."
26:00;26:00;"- No, I know."
26:00;26:04;"We gave him mad love, too, when we listened to Joker."
26:04;26:08;"- Yeah, Joker's a great song, although it's no Joker, man."
26:08;26:10;"- Well, that goes without saying."
26:10;26:13;"- You, sir, know Bob Dylan."
26:13;26:15;"That'd be cool if that were some kind of"
26:15;26:19;"classic rock event, like Steve Miller went up to Dylan,"
26:19;26:21;"must be a fan of his, and just like,"
26:21;26:25;"""Hey, man, really just want to say what a fan of yours I am,"""
26:25;26:28;"and Bob says, ""(beep) you, you dissed Jerry."""
26:28;26:29;"Turns his back."
26:29;26:30;"- Jerry's my boy."
26:30;26:32;"- Bob never dissed Jerry."
26:32;26:33;"They toured together, too."
26:33;26:35;"- '87, dude, Dylan and the Dead."
26:35;26:35;"- Yep."
26:35;26:37;"- Are you in on Dylan and the Dead?"
26:37;26:39;"- I've tried to listen to that live record."
26:39;26:40;"- I'm in."
26:40;26:41;"I mean, it's definitely like a low point"
26:41;26:43;"in both their careers."
26:43;26:45;"- It doesn't sound great,"
26:45;26:47;"although Dylan and the Dead, it's a gold album,"
26:47;26:50;"as I recall, from looking at the discography."
26:50;26:52;"- Two icons teaming up like that,"
26:52;26:54;"I mean, it's gonna sell, for sure."
26:54;26:57;"Sounds good to me, man."

29:23;29:24;"- Decent."
29:24;29:25;"- Solid."
29:25;29:27;"- Oh yeah, the elections happened."
29:27;29:28;"- Yeah, I mean, elections were decent."
29:28;29:29;"- Yeah, for sure."
29:29;29:31;"- Here's a good email we got."
29:31;29:33;"We were talking the other day about how"
29:33;29:35;"TC Heads has really seemed to stick"
29:35;29:37;"for fans of Time Crisis,"
29:37;29:39;"but there's never really been a good name"
29:39;29:41;"for fans of Vampire Weekend."
29:41;29:42;"- Yeah."
29:42;29:45;"- And as also we found out over the past couple weeks,"
29:45;29:48;"not every TC Head is a Vampire Weekend head,"
29:48;29:49;"and vice versa."
29:49;29:52;"- We've gotten a solid amount of emails"
29:52;29:55;"that are just like, I do not like that band."
29:55;29:59;"- We specifically asked on the last show,"
29:59;30:01;"is there anybody,"
30:01;30:05;"is there anybody who's a true TC Head"
30:05;30:07;"who just does not like Vampire Weekend?"
30:07;30:10;"- To be fair, nobody said they hated Vampire Weekend."
30:10;30:11;"That would have been a shocker,"
30:11;30:13;"but there are plenty of people who are like,"
30:13;30:16;"not a fan of the band, it's just not my thing."
30:16;30:17;"Although they're probably being extra polite"
30:17;30:19;"because they're TC Heads."
30:19;30:21;"- And Jake, your painting, real boring."
30:21;30:23;"(laughing)"
30:23;30:25;"Like whatever you guys do outside of the show,"
30:25;30:26;"not into it."
30:26;30:27;"- Bullshit."
30:27;30:28;"- Hate Neo Yokio."
30:28;30:29;"(laughing)"
30:29;30:30;"- I hate it all."
30:30;30:32;"Well, I guess the thing is that,"
30:32;30:36;"to be fair, the paintings, Vampire Weekend, Neo Yokio,"
30:36;30:39;"they don't really stand a chance against time crisis"
30:39;30:41;"because internet radio is the ultimate art form."
30:41;30:44;"What we provide on this show--"
30:44;30:45;"- It's ethical content."
30:45;30:46;"- Is ethical content."
30:46;30:49;"(laughing)"
30:49;30:51;"- Through a major corporation."
30:51;30:53;"- Ethical content through a major corporation"
30:53;30:56;"that when you listen to time crisis,"
30:56;31:01;"you're stepping into two to three minds at any given time."
31:01;31:04;"You're directly teleporting into a situation."
31:04;31:07;"It's what the other art forms aspire to."
31:07;31:08;"- Like the dead, man."
31:08;31:12;"- But even the dead, known for improvisation,"
31:12;31:17;"new ideas, hairpin turns, unexpected musical moments,"
31:17;31:19;"even they, like any musicians,"
31:19;31:22;"would not have the agility of internet radio hosts."
31:22;31:25;"Somebody actually stopped me on the street recently."
31:25;31:28;"A guy yelled my name and I kinda looked over"
31:28;31:30;"as he drove by and then he backed up down the block"
31:30;31:33;"just to be like, ""Yo, man, big fan."
31:33;31:34;"""Love time crisis."""
31:34;31:38;"Maybe because TC is a slightly more tucked away thing,"
31:38;31:40;"it almost makes me feel a little better."
31:40;31:42;"I've met many Vampire Weekend fans over the years."
31:42;31:45;"A true TC head is a little more rare."
31:45;31:47;"But actually, somebody, was this in the email"
31:47;31:49;"or was this on Twitter or something?"
31:49;31:52;"Somebody made a Venn diagram of the differences"
31:52;31:55;"between Vampire Weekend fans and TC heads."
31:55;31:57;"Seinfeld, we get a number crunch on that?"
31:57;32:00;"- I like how this episode is fully self-referential."
32:00;32:01;"- Oh yeah."
32:01;32:02;"- Talking about our own merch."
32:02;32:05;"- Yeah, at least it started with a star is born,"
32:05;32:08;"which is a major Hollywood motion picture."
32:08;32:10;"- Now we're talking about listeners of the show"
32:10;32:12;"that don't like our outside work."
32:12;32:14;"(laughing)"
32:14;32:15;"That's right, that was an email."
32:15;32:19;"That's the VWTC Zeitgeist."
32:19;32:20;"- This is from Virginia."
32:20;32:22;"Howdy, first time caller, long time listener."
32:22;32:24;"So I made a Venn diagram contrasting VW fans"
32:24;32:26;"and TC heads after today's app."
32:26;32:28;"In the Vampire Weekend category,"
32:28;32:32;"you get a fleece that I own, my guitar,"
32:32;32:34;"a comma, I guess it's Oxford comma,"
32:34;32:37;"the two frogs from the Father's Day Weekend shirt,"
32:37;32:41;"a Ralph Lauren bear, Steve Buscemi,"
32:41;32:43;"and a Vampire Weekend album Mitsubishi Macchiato,"
32:43;32:45;"which doesn't exist."
32:45;32:47;"That's in the solely Vampire Weekend category."
32:47;32:50;"For the TC heads, you get the anti-Steve Miller,"
32:50;32:54;"Seinfeld 2000, Grateful Dead, Cheetos,"
32:54;32:56;"One of Jake's, Pizza Hut paintings,"
32:56;32:58;"Can I Get Another Crunch, Tim Horton, Supreme Brick,"
32:58;33:03;"Dunkin' Donuts, Iced Coffee, the word brutal, and Goldfish."
33:03;33:05;"In the middle of the--"
33:05;33:06;"- The word brutal."
33:06;33:07;"- Yeah, the word brutal."
33:07;33:10;"In the middle of the Venn diagram,"
33:10;33:13;"what Virginia calls the VWTC Zeitgeist,"
33:13;33:16;"you get Jake wearing an eight minute Cape Cod tie-dye."
33:16;33:17;"That makes a lot of sense."
33:17;33:18;"- Solid."
33:18;33:20;"- Eight minute Cape Cod is a concept"
33:20;33:23;"that Jake initially pitched that became a reality."
33:23;33:26;"That's one of the true middle points of the Venn diagram."
33:26;33:29;"Eight minute Cape Cod, Tasteful Palette, well I'd hope so."
33:29;33:33;"I'd hope that Vampire Weekend has a Tasteful Palette."
33:33;33:37;"Toblerone, that's a little bit the Neo-Yokio universe."
33:37;33:38;"- Yeah, that's a separate Venn."
33:38;33:40;"- Which we call the NYU."
33:40;33:43;"And then Joker Man font, that's true"
33:43;33:46;"because Joker Man font is, we talked about on the show,"
33:46;33:48;"but it's also on the Time Crisis t-shirt,"
33:48;33:51;"but also Vampire Weekend's working on a cover."
33:51;33:55;"And then the green spiral that we used on some--"
33:55;33:57;"- Oh, on the Father's Day Weekend shirt."
33:57;33:59;"- Yeah, okay, I buy it."
33:59;34:00;"- Solid Venn."
34:00;34:02;"- Solid Venn."
34:02;34:04;"So anyway, yes, there are TC heads"
34:04;34:06;"who don't listen to Vampire Weekend,"
34:06;34:09;"and again, I get it, this is the ultimate art form."

36:52;36:55;"Nothing rolls off the tongue like TC head, VW head is not good."
36:55;36:59;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
36:59;37:03;"Hello TC crew, I don't know if there are many TC heads from Mexico, but I'm one of them."
37:03;37:04;"Tight."
37:04;37:06;"Shout out to all Mexican TC heads."
37:06;37:11;"I've never written to a radio show/podcast/whatever beats one radio is before,"
37:11;37:16;"but I was listening to the last episode, three days later from its airing in true TC fashion,"
37:16;37:21;"and I think I have a good suggestion to finally solve the Vampire Weekend fanbase name conundrum."
37:21;37:24;"Spicing it up with a bit of corporate trivia, from Mexico."
37:24;37:26;"I'm very intrigued."
37:26;37:30;"Every time you guys talk about Vampire Weekend calling it VW, I can't help thinking about"
37:30;37:33;"the big car manufacturing corporation Volkswagen."
37:33;37:37;"I know, Volkswagen is from Germany, not from Mexico, but please bear with me."
37:37;37:40;"VW's biggest assembly plant is located in Puebla, Mexico."
37:40;37:47;"It was built in the 60s mainly to manufacture the VW sedan, also known as the original VW Beetle."
37:47;37:51;"I don't know if you guys visited Mexico sometime in the 90s, but it was packed with VW Beetles."
37:51;37:54;"It became the most common car in the country."
37:54;37:55;"I didn't know that."
37:55;37:57;"Even all the taxi cabs were Beetles."
37:57;38:00;"The Beetle craze was so big in Mexico that people even came up with a cute nickname for"
38:00;38:02;"the car, Vocho."
38:02;38:07;"Everyone in Mexico knows the VW sedan Beetle as Vocho, or sometimes Vochito, when there"
38:07;38:11;"is a more profound emotional attachment to the car."
38:11;38:15;"Now Ezra, I know, or at least I can guess from some of your lyrics that you enjoy using"
38:15;38:17;"some Spanish words occasionally."
38:17;38:18;"That's true."
38:18;38:20;"So I thought VW heads should be called Vochos."
38:20;38:24;"A small catchy word that references the band's name initials while also addressing a fun"
38:24;38:28;"fact of corporate history and thus relating it also to time crisis, the show where the"
38:28;38:30;"audience was asked to come up with names."
38:30;38:32;"As you guys say full circle, thanks for reading."
38:32;38:33;"This show does roll."
38:33;38:34;"Cheers, Javier."
38:34;38:35;"Great suggestion."
38:36;38:41;"Okay, now Javier is from Mexico, so it's cool that Javier suggested this."
38:41;38:43;"How do you pull it off?"
38:43;38:44;"How do I pull it off?"
38:44;38:45;"Especially as a gringo."
38:45;38:48;"I can't be getting on Twitter tomorrow, be like, ""Hey guys."""
38:48;38:51;"From now on our fans are called Vochos."
38:51;38:52;"You know what I mean?"
38:52;38:53;"That can't be a top-down directive."
38:53;38:54;"No, it wouldn't fly."
38:54;38:58;"I mean, even if it was, any name wouldn't work."
38:58;39:00;"I mean, like- You just say just give up on this whole thing?"
39:00;39:04;"I mean, any sort of top-down directive, it's not gonna, if it's not organic, it's not gonna"
39:04;39:05;"work."
39:05;39:06;"But I do like the suggestion."
39:06;39:08;"Mexico is a very important country for Vampire Weekend."
39:08;39:09;"Really?"
39:09;39:10;"Yeah."
39:10;39:12;"You play a lot of shows there?"
39:12;39:13;"Not a lot."
39:13;39:14;"I want to play more."
39:14;39:17;"I once said, I don't want to disrespect anybody."
39:17;39:22;"It's not because I don't love Europe, but one time I did ask the people we work with,"
39:22;39:23;"managers, booking agents, whatever."
39:23;39:26;"I was like, ""What if instead of going to Europe, we just went to Mexico?"
39:26;39:28;"We'd save a bundle on flights."""
39:28;39:30;"They're like, ""You really should go to Europe."""
39:30;39:32;"And I was like, ""No, no, you're right."
39:32;39:36;"We've always had amazing shows in England and France."""
39:36;39:41;"I just never liked the fact, because when you're in a band, you basically, you tour"
39:41;39:42;"the US and Europe constantly."
39:42;39:44;"Then maybe Australia and Japan."
39:44;39:46;"At least this is how it used to be."
39:46;39:49;"And then Latin America is always this afterthought."
39:49;39:50;"Because it's hard."
39:50;39:51;"It's hard to go everywhere."
39:51;39:56;"And I always had this feeling that a lot of our best fans were in Latin America, specifically"
39:56;39:57;"Mexico."
39:57;40:01;"So there was part of me that's just like, ""Why can't we just, instead of going to Europe"
40:01;40:04;"for a month, why don't we go to Europe for a week and go to Mexico for a month?"""
40:04;40:07;"Just play a ton of shows there."
40:07;40:08;"Yeah."
40:08;40:11;"What if you did a week at one club in Mexico City?"
40:11;40:12;"I'd love it."
40:12;40:13;"We might lose a lot of money, but-"
40:13;40:14;"Would you?"
40:14;40:15;"You can't take it with you, man."
40:15;40:16;"That's true, man."
40:16;40:17;"What are you going to do?"
40:17;40:18;"I mean-"
40:18;40:19;"Spend that money in heaven?"
40:19;40:20;"Yeah."
40:20;40:21;"I mean-"
40:21;40:22;"Why would you lose a lot of money?"
40:22;40:26;"Play like a week at a decent-sized venue in Mexico City?"
40:26;40:31;"Well, the whole infrastructure of touring, as I understand it, I'm also really not a"
40:31;40:32;"numbers guy."
40:32;40:35;"That's why I always have Seinfeld crunch the numbers."
40:35;40:37;"And don't get it twisted, I'm pretty good at math."
40:37;40:39;"But I don't like cracking open the books."
40:39;40:42;"I mean, not knowing anything, it seems like it would be efficient."
40:42;40:43;"You'd just move the gear once."
40:43;40:46;"You move it down from LA down to Mexico City."
40:46;40:48;"It's there for a week."
40:48;40:49;"It just sits on the stage all day."
40:49;40:54;"I think sometimes you're told that the most money you could possibly make, and touring's"
40:54;40:58;"expensive, so it's not always just about making money, it's about not losing money."
40:58;41:02;"But they would say the most money you could make is to go to each city once and play the"
41:02;41:03;"biggest show possible."
41:03;41:08;"So then if I come in and I'm like, ""Let's do a week in Mexico City,"" people would be"
41:08;41:10;"like, ""Ezra, you're a dreamer."
41:10;41:14;"Never lose that spark of imagination, but gotta keep the trains running."""
41:14;41:16;"What if it was more of like a DJ residency?"
41:16;41:20;"Like no band, just you, a couple of DJs."
41:20;41:23;"That takes a bit of the fun out of it."
41:23;41:24;"Live TC."
41:24;41:29;"I'm sure that I could go down to Mexico by myself, crash on somebody's couch, and just"
41:29;41:30;"DJ."
41:30;41:31;"That'd be so weak."
41:31;41:32;"That would suck."
41:32;41:34;"No, okay, I would love to make this happen."
41:34;41:39;"And actually, like I said, like I said, Vampire Weekend, we've always considered Mexico to"
41:39;41:42;"be one of our special countries."
41:42;41:46;"We've luckily never had like terrible shows anywhere, but there's just been like certain"
41:46;41:47;"countries..."
41:47;41:49;"You know, the first time we started going to England, we just like felt connected to"
41:49;41:51;"the fans there."
41:51;41:52;"It's like early adopters."
41:52;41:56;"And the first time I went to Mexico, we also felt a real connection."
41:56;42:01;"And I don't just mean this in the way that like a singer on stage at a show just being"
42:01;42:07;"like, ""You know, man, we haven't been back to this city in five years."
42:07;42:08;"We f***ing love it here."""
42:08;42:12;"People might be mad, but I'll say it."
42:12;42:13;"This might be the best crowd of the tour."
42:13;42:18;"I've probably said s*** like that, so I don't mean to put anybody on blast."
42:18;42:22;"But you know, that's like the just s*** that people say spur of the moment on tour."
42:22;42:24;"But I think the first time we went to Mexico was in 2009."
42:24;42:27;"So it was in between the first and the second album."
42:27;42:29;"And we had like a lot of time off there."
42:29;42:31;"So I'd always really liked this DJ named Toy Selecta."
42:31;42:33;"I always listened to his remixes."
42:33;42:36;"And then we were like at a party or something."
42:36;42:40;"Like the promoters took us out to a party and we were just like eating amazing food"
42:40;42:42;"and like getting drunk."
42:42;42:45;"And you know, like sometimes you go to another country, people are like, ""So you like Mexican"
42:45;42:46;"music?"""
42:46;42:47;"I was like, ""Yeah, I like Mexican music."""
42:47;42:49;"I really like this Mexican DJ, Toy Selecta."
42:49;42:52;"And they were like, ""Oh, he's my friend, man."
42:52;42:53;"You should hang out with him."
42:53;42:54;"He's in the party."""
42:54;42:55;"And they're just like, ""Yo, come here."""
42:55;43:00;"And then we like hung out and then they took us to like a rodeo."
43:00;43:02;"And then we went to Mexico City and we had a lot of time off."
43:02;43:05;"So we were like, ""Maybe we should record some of the next album here."""
43:05;43:06;"I'm a real homebody."
43:06;43:10;"I like to just be at somebody's home studio all the time."
43:10;43:11;"Post up."
43:11;43:12;"I like to post up."
43:12;43:15;"So we've never been on that like, ""Let's travel to get a different vibe."""
43:15;43:16;"But we just happened to have time off."
43:16;43:17;"We were in the middle of recording an album."
43:17;43:20;"So they were like, ""Yo, we can find you a cool studio in Mexico City."""
43:20;43:25;"And it was owned by one of the people from a pretty well-known Mexican man called Molotov."
43:25;43:30;"Like a beautiful old house, kind of in the same neighborhood as like Frida Kahlo's house,"
43:30;43:32;"like a great courtyard."
43:32;43:35;"And we recorded most of Cousins there."
43:35;43:36;"Okay, cool."
43:36;43:39;"So we were like been working on it for a few days in the studio."
43:39;43:42;"We took some pictures that ended up being in the Contra booklet."
43:42;43:45;"And then we were like kind of, you know, sometimes I really get in my head like, ""I don't want"
43:45;43:47;"to play new shit unless it's ready."""
43:47;43:49;"But we just spent a few days recording it."
43:49;43:50;"So we had a show in Guadalajara."
43:50;43:51;"We were like, ""F*** it, let's play Cousins."""
43:51;43:55;"So we like played Cousins for the first time in Guadalajara and like the fans were sick."
43:55;43:58;"And so, you know, it's like, maybe that's a fairly mundane story."
43:58;44:01;"But I'm just saying like that doesn't happen in every country."
44:01;44:04;"And then, you know, we like really hung out with the promoter a lot."
44:04;44:05;"And actually I saw him."
44:05;44:07;"You know, every country you got like your main promoter."
44:07;44:10;"And I saw the dude at Lollapalooza this summer."
44:10;44:12;"He just happened to be there checking out bands and sh*t."
44:12;44:14;"And I was like, ""Yo, we got to go back to Mexico."""
44:14;44:15;"And he was like, ""Let's make it happen, man."
44:15;44:16;"Let's do something special."""
44:16;44:17;"Love it."
44:17;44:20;"Maybe I'll tell him like, ""Yo, Jake has an idea."
44:20;44:21;"Week residency."""
44:21;44:22;"Oh, yeah."
44:22;44:23;"Yo."
44:23;44:24;"Dude, Richard Pictures."
44:24;44:25;"I was just thinking that."
44:25;44:26;"Vampire Weekend."
44:26;44:27;"I was just thinking that."
44:27;44:28;"Week long residency in Mexico City."
44:28;44:30;"Vampire Weekend, Richard Pictures."
44:30;44:31;"Mexico City."
44:31;44:32;"Five nights."
44:33;44:34;"I love that when bands do that."
44:34;44:35;"They have a stand."

55:31;55:33;"Like it kind of just gets into, you know."
55:33;55:37;"Yeah, general like we ran a good campaign, the fight's not over."
55:37;55:40;"And I think we all agree we haven't heard the last of Mr. O'Rourke."

56:08;56:11;"A printout of this will be in the next Whitney Biennial."
56:11;56:15;"And I got to say, actually, I was like confused by it at first."

56:20;56:21;"Yeah."
56:21;56:24;"Like we got to fight."" And the truth is, people get kind of numb to them."
56:24;56:25;"Big time."
56:25;56:33;"I remember there was once a funny Onion headline that was about somebody who worked for moveon.org getting kidnapped."
56:33;56:39;"And the only way that they could reach the outside world was to use the official moveon.org email"
56:39;56:45;"to send out to millions of people emails about, ""Help, I'm being held against my will. I'm at this address."
56:45;56:48;"Please call the police."" But nobody opened them."
56:48;56:49;"Oh my god."

56:50;56:55;"Kidnapped moveon.org staffers, ""Please help"" emails went completely ignored."

56:59;57:01;"From the Onion newsroom, yeah."
57:01;57:06;"But anyway, I don't know why I was drawn to this one, but there's something pleasantly surprising."
57:06;57:09;"And confusing at first, but pleasantly surprising about Beto."
57:09;57:13;"He could have opened it like-- and maybe that's why it caught people's attention."
57:13;57:18;"Maybe not that many people's attention, but he could have opened it like, ""We lost. We started here."""
57:18;57:19;"Yeah."
57:19;57:21;"And he chose to open it with, ""Amy is watching Last of the Mohicans."""
57:21;57:24;"At first I was like, ""Whoa, wrong email?"""
57:24;57:27;"Or, ""Is Beto emailing me personally?"""
57:27;57:33;"Yeah. Anyway, shout out to Beto. Congratulations to all the Democrats who won in the past election."
57:33;57:34;"Decent."
57:34;57:35;"Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"So, you ready for the top five?"

57:55;57:56;"Yeah, yeah, it's true."
57:56;57:59;"We're always caught in the late '70s, early '80s. Why 1991?"
57:59;58:06;"Beto O'Rourke formed a band called FOSS, which is the most '90s band name ever."
58:06;58:08;"It's like floss without the L."
58:08;58:09;"Yeah, F-O-S-S."
58:09;58:17;"Formed at Columbia University, featuring Cedric Bixler of At the Drive-In/Mars Volta."
58:17;58:22;"A legend. Yeah, Beto went to Columbia, same college as me."
58:22;58:23;"Started a band there, just like you."
58:23;58:27;"That's right. We got a lot in common. That's why I supported his campaign."
58:27;58:29;"You'll be running for office in 12 years."
58:29;58:32;"No, never, but I will continue to support Beto."
58:32;58:36;"The number five song in 1991 is Brian Adams, who's Canadian."

01:22:48;01:22:50;"they don't hit the chorus until minute 40."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"That's tight."
01:22:52;01:22:56;"Colin just showed me Bradley learned the bass when he was younger."
01:22:56;01:22:57;"Okay."
01:22:57;01:22:58;"But learned the guitar for the--"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"All right."
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Used some of that bass knowledge to help him out."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Okay, he knows the roots."
01:23:12;01:23:14;"We always gotta let this one play out."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"Maybe there's a special surprise movie, Eddie Vedder, coming out."
01:24:13;01:24:15;"[laughs]"
01:24:15;01:24:19;"That was a big question after seeing the movie,"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"is who's Jackson Maine based on."
01:24:22;01:24:25;"It's like Vedder meets, like, Sturgill Simpson or something."
01:24:25;01:24:27;"Yeah, well, somebody said--"
01:24:27;01:24:29;"somebody also described him as Chris Stapleton."
01:24:29;01:24:31;"Oh, sure, sure."
01:24:31;01:24:35;"So Jackson Maine is a character that doesn't quite exist in the real world."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Did we ever talk about this on Time Crisis?"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"What's the real world called?"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"What do you call the universe that's not like the Marvel Cinematic Universe"
01:24:42;01:24:43;"or the S.C. Boo?"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Did we ever come up with something?"
01:24:45;01:24:46;"Did we make something up?"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"I don't think so."
01:24:48;01:24:50;"I think it's just called the real world."
01:24:50;01:24:53;"Isn't the film term non-diegetic?"
01:24:53;01:24:56;"When music doesn't exist within the world of the--"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"when the score is non-diegetic."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"Well, I thought we came up with the phrase for, like,"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"okay, you know you go see, like, what, an Avengers movie or, like, Thor?"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Yeah."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"When you're watching one of those movies, you're talking about them,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"you're thinking about them, you go see Avengers,"
01:25:10;01:25:14;"and Thor, he lives in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, right?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Yes."
01:25:15;01:25:16;"Right?"
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Yep, agreed."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Okay, but then the movie's over."
01:25:19;01:25:20;"Right."
01:25:20;01:25:22;"And then you walk outside the theater."
01:25:22;01:25:23;"What universe are you in?"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Planet Earth."
01:25:25;01:25:27;"That's the Earth, not the universe."
01:25:27;01:25:28;"Real life."
01:25:28;01:25:29;"It's the RLU?"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Yeah."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"That seems a little--"
01:25:31;01:25:32;"It's called-- how about just reality?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"That seems a little elitist."
01:25:33;01:25:35;"I don't like the real part."
01:25:35;01:25:37;"Maybe, like, the non-MCU?"
01:25:37;01:25:40;"Oh, yeah, it's the NMCU."
01:25:40;01:25:44;"Although the non-MCU would also technically include the Acebo."
01:25:44;01:25:46;"Wait, would it?"
01:25:46;01:25:50;"The non-MCU is anything that has no film, no fiction in it."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"The Acebo is its own sub-universe within--"
01:25:53;01:25:58;"A Star is Born, the film, would exist in the non-MCU."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"Just the film."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"But not the Acebo."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"Acebo would not exist within the non-MCU."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"Yeah, you're right."
01:26:04;01:26:05;"But the film would."
01:26:05;01:26:06;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:26:06;01:26:09;"And then we were going to do the Bradley Cooper directing T-shirt."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Oh, yeah, oh, right."
01:26:12;01:26:15;"Bradley Cooper directing T-shirt."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I'd wear that."
01:26:17;01:26:22;"I like this idea of me wearing uncomfortable T-shirts around for a day"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"and then reporting back."
01:26:24;01:26:26;"That could be like our carpool karaoke,"
01:26:26;01:26:32;"just following you around in normal kind of off-brand T-shirts."
01:26:32;01:26:36;"Okay, today Jake's wearing the black V-neck Star is Born tee."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"Let's check in."
01:26:37;01:26:38;"See what happens."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"He just left Civil Coffee in Figaro in Highland Park."
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Jake, how'd that go in there?"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"I got some looks."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"Yeah, some looks."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"That's about it."
01:26:47;01:26:52;"The number two song in '91, Prince and the New Power Generation, ""Cream."""
01:26:52;01:26:55;"I didn't realize this song was that big of a hit."
01:26:55;01:26:57;"That's a pretty horny beginning."
01:27:02;01:27:03;"Okay."
01:27:03;01:27:06;"That is a fierce snare sound."
01:27:11;01:27:18;"You know, the B-sides of this song were a song called Horny Pony and Gangster Glam."
01:27:18;01:27:20;"Great titles."
01:27:30;01:27:33;"Mops the floor to that Brian Adams, sad to say."
01:27:33;01:27:35;"I'm not feeling you on that."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"This song's so much better produced, got more space."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"I'd rather listen to the Brian Adams."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"You're kidding. Really?"
01:27:40;01:27:44;"I'll take a maudlin ballad over generic funk."
01:27:44;01:27:46;"No, but that Brian Adams was not--"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"It was not top-shelf Brian Adams."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"It wasn't a ballad either."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"Well, it was like mid-tempo ballad."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"You don't like Prince?"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"No, not it."
01:27:55;01:27:56;"Whoa."
01:27:56;01:27:57;"Not a fan."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Wow."
01:27:58;01:28:00;"Don't like the production."
01:28:00;01:28:04;"I think if Prince made records in the '70s, they would have been great."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"He made at least one."
01:28:06;01:28:09;"Well, he made his disco, the early Prince."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"You must like that record."
01:28:10;01:28:11;"Yeah, yeah."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Are they a little too wet for your taste?"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You mean like the reverb on the snare?"
01:28:15;01:28:16;"What do you mean?"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"I just mean metaphorically."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"No, yeah, I mean there's a lot of reverb on them."
01:28:19;01:28:22;"Yeah, they just sound really stiff to me."
01:28:22;01:28:23;"I think you did say that."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"I think he's like a wildly overrated songwriter."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"Oh, my God."

01:28:34;01:28:36;"I kind of know what you mean."
01:28:36;01:28:40;"I mean, and the truth is I do think his absolute best-sounding music"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"was that little sliver of his career that was in the '70s."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Like, this [bleep] sounds sick."

01:45:54;01:45:57;"Ariana Grande is an Italian Floridian American."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"Oh, hers is pretty succinct, actually."
01:45:58;01:46:01;"She's an American singer, songwriter, and actress."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Actress, cool."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"I thought it was actor now."
01:46:03;01:46:05;"Yeah, that's a good point."
01:46:05;01:46:06;"What's up with that?"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Wikipedia."
01:46:07;01:46:08;"It's 2018."
01:46:08;01:46:11;"Anyway, Ariana Grande, Jake, you know,"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"she really has had a crazy year."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Yep."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"There was a terrorist attack at one of her concerts."
01:46:16;01:46:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:46:17;01:46:20;"Her ex-boyfriend died, and then she had this very public romance"
01:46:20;01:46:24;"with Pete Davidson, the American painter, comedian,"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"and TV personality."
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Poet."
01:46:27;01:46:28;"And poet, podcaster."
01:46:28;01:46:31;"So she had all this kind of public--"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"High visibility."
01:46:33;01:46:37;"High visibility, a lot of public commentary on her personal life."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"And she turned into a song."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"And not only that, she turned into a hit song."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"Oh, wow."
01:46:41;01:46:42;"I don't think I've heard it."
01:46:42;01:46:46;"So it's called ""Thank U, Next,"" and it's already spawned memes."
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Have you heard it?"
01:46:47;01:46:48;"I heard some of it."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"I never heard the whole thing."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"This is like a ""Law & Order"" episode."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"This song is ripped from the headlines."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"She was shouting out all her ex-boyfriends."
01:47:22;01:47:23;"Yep."
01:47:57;01:47:59;"ZZ, what's going on here?"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Sort of."
01:48:00;01:48:03;"Honestly, I kind of zoned out."
01:48:03;01:48:06;"Well, the first verse she talks about all her exes."
01:48:06;01:48:07;"Yeah, yeah, I caught that."
01:48:07;01:48:10;"Big Sean and Mac Miller, Ricky Alvarez."
01:48:10;01:48:17;"And the interesting thing about this song is that it marries two genres"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"of breakup song."
01:48:19;01:48:23;"There's the kiss-off, which is the ""F--- you"" kind of song."
01:48:23;01:48:25;"And then there's like the slightly smaller genre,"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"and we talked about that recently on Time Crisis,"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"the ""I will always love you."""
01:48:29;01:48:32;"That's kind of looking at a breakup as something that happens,"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"doesn't mean that there wasn't something there,"
01:48:35;01:48:36;"just didn't work out."
01:48:36;01:48:37;"Life's a crazy trip, man."
01:48:37;01:48:39;"Life's a crazy trip, and it's sad."
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Sometimes you've got to say goodbye because it just doesn't work."
01:48:41;01:48:48;"[singing]"
01:48:48;01:48:51;"So these are two types of breakups, and probably in life,"
01:48:51;01:48:53;"people have experienced both."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"And this song is interesting because it's a little bit of both."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"She's saying ""Thank you."""
01:48:57;01:48:58;"Yeah, I caught that."
01:48:58;01:48:59;"""Thank you, next."""
01:48:59;01:49:01;"Next, like on to the next one?"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"Yeah, but who is the next one?"
01:49:03;01:49:04;"I don't know."
01:49:04;01:49:08;"That's the question that she sets up in chorus one."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"Going into verse two."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Going into verse two, maybe we'll get some answers."
01:49:12;01:49:18;"[singing]"
01:49:18;01:49:19;"Catch that?"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"We have what discussions?"
01:49:20;01:49:23;"I met someone else, we have better discussions."
01:49:23;01:49:27;"Maybe with Big Sean, they shared an interest in antiquing or something,"
01:49:27;01:49:30;"but outside of that, they didn't have much to talk about."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"She met somebody new, and they have better discussions."
01:49:32;01:49:40;"[singing]"
01:49:40;01:49:41;"Her name is what?"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"She met somebody new."
01:49:42;01:49:43;"Her name is Irene?"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"And her name is Irene."
01:49:45;01:49:46;"That's not the lyric."
01:49:46;01:49:47;"Yeah."
01:49:47;01:49:48;"Oh, it is, okay."
01:49:48;01:49:49;"I was like, ""Did I hear that right?"""
01:49:49;01:49:50;"No, you didn't hear it right."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"No, I didn't."
01:49:51;01:49:52;"Irene."
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Yeah, so I'm done with all these guys."
01:49:54;01:49:56;"I met somebody new, we have better discussions."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Wait, back it up, because it sounds like her name is Irene."
01:49:58;01:50:00;"And her name is Irene."
01:50:00;01:50:20;"[singing]"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"You catch it this time?"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"It still sounds like Irene."
01:50:24;01:50:27;"It sounds like her name is Irene."
01:50:27;01:50:34;"[singing]"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"What does it sound like to you?"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"I think I read the lyrics before I even heard the song."
01:50:38;01:50:39;"[singing]"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"They say that I move on too fast."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"Yeah?"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"But her name is Irene, and this one gone last."
01:50:45;01:50:47;"So it's going to work out with Irene."
01:50:47;01:50:49;"[laughing]"
01:50:49;01:50:51;"Okay, it's not Irene."
01:50:51;01:50:54;"[explosion]"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Her name is Ari."
01:50:55;01:50:58;"Okay, I'm in the dark here, bud."
01:50:58;01:51:00;"[laughing]"
01:51:00;01:51:01;"It's her."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Ari is Ariana."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"[explosion]"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"Oh, that's deep, dude."
01:51:06;01:51:08;"Oh, [bleep] man."
01:51:08;01:51:10;"Oh, man, that's deep."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"You just blew my mind, man."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"That's good, man."
01:51:13;01:51:14;"Take some time."
01:51:14;01:51:16;"Don't just dive into the next relationship."
01:51:16;01:51:18;"I mean, take some time for yourself."
01:51:18;01:51:20;"Do some self-reflection, right?"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"It kind of--yeah, at first you think she's just like,"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"""Whatever, I'm just burning through, guys."""
01:51:24;01:51:26;"And then she's like, ""No, but this time,"
01:51:26;01:51:29;"""the next is not just the next dude."
01:51:29;01:51:30;"""It's me."""
01:51:30;01:51:31;"[singing]"
01:51:31;01:51:32;"She taught me patience."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"She handled pain."
01:51:34;01:51:36;"That's amazing."
01:51:36;01:51:39;"I've loved her all my life."
01:51:39;01:51:41;"But that's not what I need."
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Look what I found."
01:51:43;01:51:47;"No need for searching anymore."
01:51:47;01:51:57;"[singing]"
01:51:57;01:52:00;"Grateful is kind of--I saw that the Oxford English Dictionary"
01:52:00;01:52:02;"said that the word of the year was toxic."
01:52:02;01:52:04;"That seems about 3 years late to me."
01:52:04;01:52:05;"Yeah."
01:52:05;01:52:06;"I'm a very forward-thinking person,"
01:52:06;01:52:09;"so generally when the Oxford English Dictionary"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"announces the word of the year, I'm like, ""Really?"""
01:52:12;01:52:13;"Seems a bit late."
01:52:13;01:52:14;"Yeah, it's 2016."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"Yeah, it's a 2016 word."
01:52:16;01:52:19;"Anyway, I think the word of the year should be ""grateful."""
01:52:19;01:52:21;"I just heard it in Ariana Grande's song."
01:52:21;01:52:25;"I neglected to say earlier that ""subject,"""
01:52:25;01:52:28;"a.k.a. the title of that Beto O'Rourke email,"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"was ""grateful."""
01:52:29;01:52:30;"Strong."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"And then, of course, you got the Grateful Dead"
01:52:32;01:52:35;"who have been experiencing a new wave of enthusiasm"
01:52:35;01:52:40;"via their dead and co. successful touring,"
01:52:40;01:52:44;"revitalized interest in the vintage T-shirts."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"Grateful."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"This is a grateful year."
01:52:46;01:52:48;"It might not feel that way."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Are you saying the time crisis word of the year is ""grateful""?"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"The time crisis word of the year is ""grateful."""
01:52:52;01:52:55;"Maybe we got to do this, because I'm so f***ing sick of"
01:52:55;01:52:58;"the OED always trotting out these"
01:52:58;01:53:01;"one-to-two-year-too-late words of the year."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"Right."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"It's pretty TC, actually."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"Yeah, actually, when you put it that way."
01:53:04;01:53:06;"To be about six months behind this curve."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"When you put it that way, okay,"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"I f*** with the Oxford English Dictionary."
01:53:09;01:53:10;"That's cool."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"You guys are slackers like us."
01:53:11;01:53:14;"Yeah, we don't need to get all aggro and slack on the OED."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"We'll just say that."
01:53:15;01:53:16;"TC."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"I'm grateful for the OED."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"I'm grateful for the TCU."
01:53:20;01:53:21;"Here we are."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"We're rounding third here."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"Year's almost over."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"That's true."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"Couple laps left."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"Have to do a big Christmas special."
01:53:28;01:53:29;"Oh, yeah."
01:53:29;01:53:33;"And also, is this our last episode before Thanksgiving?"
01:53:33;01:53:34;"Yeah."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Nothing to be grateful for."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"You know how a lot of people are done with Columbus Day?"
01:53:40;01:53:41;"Yeah."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"A lot of people actually were like, ""Why are we--?"""
01:53:42;01:53:45;"Columbus was like a genocidal maniac, right?"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Like, ""Why don't we just skip Columbus Day,"
01:53:47;01:53:50;"give some money to indigenous people's organizations?"""
01:53:50;01:53:52;"You know, you kind of can't fault that."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"Mm-hmm."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"One thing I've wondered is,"
01:53:54;01:53:57;"because sometimes you meet people who aren't into Thanksgiving--"
01:53:57;01:53:58;"Really? Is that a thing?"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"I've found this a few times."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"I'm basically talking about once or twice this happened"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"where somebody's like, ""I don't like to celebrate Thanksgiving."""
01:54:04;01:54:06;"And the first thing in my head, I'm always like,"
01:54:06;01:54:09;"""Oh, is it because of the relationship to--?"""
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Native Americans?"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Colonization, the genocide,"
01:54:12;01:54:15;"the horrible things that were done to Native Americans."
01:54:15;01:54:18;"And usually the answer is, ""Oh, no, it's just not for me."""
01:54:18;01:54:22;"But is there any movement to, like, cancel Thanksgiving, Seinfeld?"
01:54:22;01:54:26;"Well, what I'm finding here is just some editorial type of things."
01:54:26;01:54:28;"I'm not really finding any sort of coalition"
01:54:28;01:54:31;"or grassroots type of movement, you know, canceling--"
01:54:31;01:54:34;"There's just some individual perspectives"
01:54:34;01:54:36;"on why it's a problematic holiday."
01:54:36;01:54:39;"I guess the way I always thought of it is that Columbus Day,"
01:54:39;01:54:42;"even, like, the rosiest picture"
01:54:42;01:54:45;"of the European conquest of the Americas"
01:54:45;01:54:48;"still makes Columbus look pretty bad."
01:54:48;01:54:52;"But the Thanksgiving story as we were taught it"
01:54:52;01:54:55;"was almost like, listen, a lot of bad things happened"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"when the Europeans came to this land,"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"the slaughter, horrible things."
01:54:59;01:55:03;"But at least in this one little place up in Massachusetts,"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"a bunch of religious refugees showed up,"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"didn't know what to do with themselves,"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"and broke bread with the indigenous people"
01:55:09;01:55:12;"in a mutually respectful way."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Right? That's the story that you erased with Jake?"
01:55:14;01:55:17;"I'm not saying it's true, but at least that story,"
01:55:17;01:55:20;"if taken at face value, you can be like, ""That sounds okay."""
01:55:20;01:55:23;"The Columbus story, even at face value, is pretty bad."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"I even want to say that the story--"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"I could be wrong-- is that the Native Americans, like,"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"kind of bailed out the pilgrims."
01:55:30;01:55:32;"Yeah, that's what I-- my understanding."
01:55:32;01:55:35;"Like, they were kind of hurting, weren't prepped for the winter."
01:55:35;01:55:37;"They didn't know how to grow food."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"Yeah, the Native Americans are like, ""We got this."""
01:55:39;01:55:41;"There's plenty to go around, man."
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Here's some corn."
01:55:42;01:55:45;"If Thanksgiving gets canceled, as perhaps it should be,"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"we'll see what happens in the future."
01:55:47;01:55:50;"I think we should start a new holiday called Gratefulsgiving."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"I like that."
01:55:51;01:55:54;"I don't know, I also just feel like maybe it's just 'cause of the Grateful Dead,"
01:55:54;01:55:57;"but isn't ""grateful"" just, like, a better word than ""thankful""?"
01:55:57;01:55:58;"I feel that."
01:55:58;01:56:01;"And Ariana Grande, she's very-- this is the number one song."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"She could have said, ""I'm so thankful for my ex."""
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Does she say ""thankful"" at any time in the song?"
01:56:05;01:56:06;"Grateful for her ex."
01:56:06;01:56:08;"She says ""grateful,"" yeah."
01:56:08;01:56:12;"Maybe that should be the next TC challenge, like, this Thanksgiving."
01:56:12;01:56:13;"Make it a Gratefulsgiving."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Yeah."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"Should it be Gratefulsgiving or Gratefulgivings?"
01:56:17;01:56:18;"I like the plural."
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Okay, wait, let's get serious for a second."
01:56:20;01:56:22;"Let's get real serious."
01:56:22;01:56:23;"Oh, it's about to get serious."
01:56:23;01:56:27;"We're totally rebranding Thanksgiving."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"We're Droga5, but instead of working with IHOP,"
01:56:30;01:56:35;"we're working with the U.S. government who wants to rebrand Thanksgiving."
01:56:35;01:56:39;"""Thankful"" is played out-- ""thanks"" is something you say ironically."
01:56:39;01:56:40;"""Thanks."""
01:56:40;01:56:43;"So we want to rebrand this holiday,"
01:56:43;01:56:46;"and we want it to involve the word ""grateful."""
01:56:46;01:56:52;"Gratefulsgivings, Gratefulgiving, Gratefulgiving feels a little weird."
01:56:52;01:56:53;"What are we going to call it?"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"That's a mouthful."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Gratefulday?"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"Gratefulday?"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"[laughs]"
01:56:59;01:57:01;"I'm out of that, Gratefulday."
01:57:01;01:57:04;"What are other ways that holidays end?"
01:57:04;01:57:06;"You know, holiday suffixes."
01:57:06;01:57:07;"""Mas""?"
01:57:07;01:57:08;"Like ""Christmas""?"
01:57:08;01:57:09;"""Ween""?"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"Gratefulmas?"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"Gratefulween?"
01:57:11;01:57:14;"Gratefulween?"
01:57:14;01:57:18;"Gratefulween, now we're talking."
01:57:18;01:57:20;"Maybe St. Gratefulsday?"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Diadelosgrateful?"
01:57:21;01:57:22;"Oh, I like that."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"St. Gratefulsday?"
01:57:24;01:57:25;"That's not bad."
01:57:25;01:57:29;"That's a bit of a pseudo-historic quality."
01:57:29;01:57:31;"St. Grateful."
01:57:31;01:57:33;"Then you can create a mascot for it."
01:57:33;01:57:35;"You know who the mascot is?"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"Blue M&M?"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"Jerry."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"Oh, Jerry!"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"I like that."
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Okay, but now we're going to get in trouble, maybe, with the estate."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"That's a weird end to the show."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"Grateful."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Okay, well, you know what?"
01:57:45;01:57:47;"We're just tossing this one back out to the TCU."
01:57:47;01:57:48;"We're spitballing here, but yeah."
01:57:48;01:57:52;"Anybody have any ideas for, if Thanksgiving gets canceled,"
01:57:52;01:57:58;"how we can create an international, universalist day of being grateful"
01:57:58;01:58:03;"that's not tied to perhaps inaccurate historical events,"
01:58:03;01:58:07;"perhaps problematic historical events, something involving grateful."
01:58:07;01:58:11;"Jerry would be the best new Thanksgiving Day mascot."
01:58:11;01:58:13;"And it takes place in the days between?"
01:58:13;01:58:16;"Early August."
01:58:16;01:58:20;"The family gathers together in early August."
01:58:20;01:58:22;"That's like a good--it's like people on vacation."
01:58:22;01:58:24;"It's like a, you know."
01:58:24;01:58:26;"Honestly, Thanksgiving does kind of like--I love it."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"It is a great holiday, and it's nice to get the family together,"
01:58:28;01:58:32;"and I love the food, but it does kind of [bleep] up the flow at the end of the year."
01:58:32;01:58:33;"Yeah, it's kind of like repetitive."
01:58:33;01:58:36;"It's like we're about to take this big break for Christmas, and then you got this--"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"It's like--"
01:58:37;01:58:38;"It's awkward."
01:58:38;01:58:40;"American efficiency plummets."
01:58:40;01:58:43;"Anyway, I hope everybody has a good Thanksgiving,"
01:58:43;01:58:46;"because I think the holiday still exists, this year at least."
01:58:46;01:58:47;"We're just getting started."
01:58:47;01:58:51;"But if it's safe, at your Thanksgiving dinner, when somebody says,"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"""What are you thankful for?"""
01:58:53;01:58:59;"Say, ""I don't know what the [bleep] thankful means, but I'll tell you what I'm grateful for."""
01:58:59;01:59:00;"Okay?"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"And let us know how that goes."
01:59:02;01:59:06;"Anyway, everybody, have a very grateful Thanksgiving."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"We'll see you in two weeks."
01:59:07;01:59:08;"Peace."
