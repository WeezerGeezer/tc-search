00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:04;00:09;"On this week's Time Crisis, we talk about the new Dolly Parton album."
00:09;00:13;"We talk about a Vampire Weekend album that just turned 10."
00:13;00:19;"We also listen to music by Madonna, Prince, and All For One."
00:19;00:25;"This is the show you love and trust."
00:25;00:27;"I swear it's--"
00:27;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:31;00:32;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""TIME CRISIS""]"
00:32;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:43;00:51;"They were a felt from beneath all my rightful chances."
00:51;00:58;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:02;"And so I dealt you the blow."
01:02;01:05;"One of us had to go."
01:05;01:06;"Now it's different."
01:06;01:09;"I want you to know."
01:09;01:12;"One of us is crying."
01:12;01:15;"One of us is lying."
01:15;01:19;"Keep the lonely man."
01:19;01:21;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:21;01:23;"How's everybody doing?"
01:23;01:24;"Frazzled."
01:24;01:27;"Jake is frazzled, sitting in traffic."
01:27;01:29;"As someone who's lived in this city for a long time now,"
01:29;01:31;"I shouldn't get frazzled."
01:31;01:34;"But man, I just got hammered with the traffic coming down here."
01:34;01:35;"Took an hour and a half."
01:35;01:37;"Can't you just positively frame that?"
01:37;01:41;"Just like more time to listen to tunes and internet radio shows."
01:41;01:43;"I like that zen outlook."
01:43;01:45;"I should have taken that outlook."
01:45;01:46;"But I was late."
01:46;01:47;"Felt guilty about that."
01:47;01:48;"But everyone was late."
01:48;01:50;"And I just-- man."
01:50;01:53;"Just that thing when you're watching a left turn arrow"
01:53;01:57;"cycle through three full cycles."
01:57;02:00;"And you're moving up like eight feet per cycle again."
02:00;02:01;"It's just like--"
02:01;02:02;"Not a good feeling."
02:02;02:04;"So I'm frazzled, man."
02:04;02:05;"Well, this ought to cheer you up."
02:05;02:07;"Country icon and recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
02:07;02:11;"inductee Dolly Parton has delivered the track list"
02:11;02:15;"for her first ever rock album, which is set for release"
02:15;02:16;"on November 17."
02:16;02:17;"Hell yeah."
02:17;02:20;"We're about six months out, but it's never too"
02:20;02:22;"soon to get excited about this."
02:22;02:25;"The upcoming LP is set to include nine original songs."
02:25;02:26;"Rock songs."
02:26;02:28;"Yeah, nine original rock songs."
02:28;02:32;"But it's a 30 song project, so that also means 21 covers."
02:32;02:32;"Double record."
02:32;02:34;"Yes, a double record."
02:34;02:36;"And nearly 40 special guests."
02:36;02:37;"Does the album have a title?"
02:37;02:39;"I think the album's called Rockstar."
02:39;02:41;"OK, this is the cover we're looking at here?"
02:41;02:43;"Yeah, Dolly with a guitar."
02:43;02:45;"Seems kind of like a strange project."
02:45;02:47;"I wonder if this is because she was inducted into the Rock"
02:47;02:49;"and Roll Hall of Fame, and she found that to be--"
02:49;02:51;"Didn't she say, don't induct me?"
02:51;02:54;"I think she said something about, yeah, I'm not a rocker,"
02:54;02:55;"but--"
02:55;02:56;"I'm a country musician."
02:56;02:57;"Yeah."
02:57;02:59;"Yeah, maybe actually--"
02:59;03:00;"Why was she inducted into the--"
03:00;03:02;"now I'm getting annoyed at the rock."
03:02;03:05;"You're going to induct Dolly Parton, but not Guided"
03:05;03:05;"by Voices?"
03:05;03:07;"Not Warren Zeevon?"
03:07;03:08;"True."
03:08;03:10;"Well, yeah, what did Dolly Parton actually say"
03:10;03:12;"when she was inducted?"
03:12;03:17;"Is it possible that just the guilt of taking Warren Zeevon's"
03:17;03:18;"spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
03:18;03:21;"has weighed on her so heavily that she felt compelled"
03:21;03:22;"to make a rock album?"
03:22;03:23;"I actually think it might be."
03:23;03:25;"Not going to cover his material."
03:25;03:26;"Maybe she is."
03:26;03:27;"I don't know."
03:27;03:29;"Is there actually a track listing, or does it--"
03:29;03:31;"It's very interesting the way they're rolling this album out,"
03:31;03:34;"just to drop the whole track list six months early."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah, it's crazy."
03:35;03:37;"I mean, there's so many guests."
03:37;03:39;"Track one, song's called Rockstar,"
03:39;03:41;"featuring Richie Sambora."
03:41;03:42;"He's going to rip a solo."
03:42;03:43;"Track two, World on Fire."
03:43;03:45;"That's an original."
03:45;03:48;"Track three, I love this, Every Breath You Take,"
03:48;03:50;"featuring Sting."
03:50;03:52;"Wow."
03:52;03:55;"I think there's a lot of stuff like that, where you're"
03:55;03:57;"kind of like covering a song and getting"
03:57;03:59;"the original artist on it."
03:59;04:00;"Everybody's on this."
04:00;04:06;"You've got John Fogerty, Kid Rock, Steven Tyler, Stevie Nicks."
04:06;04:08;"Track 11, Baby I Love Your Way, featuring--"
04:08;04:09;"Peter Frampton."
04:09;04:10;"Peter Frampton."
04:10;04:12;"Ooh, baby, I love you."
04:12;04:14;"What song is Kid Rock on?"
04:14;04:16;"It's called Either/Or."
04:16;04:17;"It's an Elliott Smith song."
04:17;04:19;"[LAUGHTER]"
04:19;04:22;"I think-- well, let's find out."
04:22;04:25;"On the one hand, it's so random."
04:25;04:28;"Country and rock music are so closely linked."
04:28;04:31;"Doesn't seem like a big deal to induct a country artist"
04:31;04:32;"into the hall."
04:32;04:33;"Dolly did feel bad, though."
04:33;04:34;"So what did she say?"
04:34;04:38;"She said, quote, ""I felt like I was taking votes away"
04:38;04:41;"from somebody that had spent a career trying to be in the hall."
04:41;04:43;"And I thought, what am I doing here?"
04:43;04:45;"I felt like I was out of place."
04:45;04:46;"Like I was betraying somebody else."""
04:46;04:48;"Whoa."
04:48;04:50;"OK, so this is serious."
04:50;04:51;"Are you happy, Hall?"
04:51;04:55;"You guilted country legend Dolly Parton so hard."
04:55;04:59;"You put her in a situation she did not want to be in,"
04:59;05:02;"she did not ask for, and you made her feel so bad."
05:02;05:04;"She had recorded a 30s song rock album."
05:04;05:07;"Now she's collaborating with Kid Rock and Richie Sambora."
05:07;05:09;"[LAUGHS]"
05:09;05:12;"This woman had lived a long, amazing life"
05:12;05:14;"with a beautiful career."
05:14;05:18;"She almost made it to the end without recording a rock album."
05:18;05:21;"And now her pristine country career"
05:21;05:24;"will have this weird smudge on it."
05:24;05:24;"It's also funny."
05:24;05:25;"Tarnished."
05:25;05:26;"She did continue."
05:26;05:29;"I mean, obviously, she's such a classy lady."
05:29;05:32;"But she said, ""Then they explained"
05:32;05:33;"why they gave it to me."
05:33;05:37;"And they said I was going to get it anyway."""
05:37;05:39;"So I thought, ""Well, I'll accept it graciously."""
05:39;05:41;"Wait, so they didn't vote on her?"
05:41;05:43;"It was like not--"
05:43;05:45;"because usually, people are nominated."
05:45;05:48;"And then the rock writers of the world--"
05:48;05:50;"Stephen Hyden covered this in an article."
05:50;05:51;"So I think there were like--"
05:51;05:54;"this past year, I think there were 14 or 15 nominees."
05:54;05:58;"And then if you're a voter, you can only choose five."
05:58;05:59;"So it's not yay or nay for each one."
05:59;06:01;"You just have to choose your five."
06:01;06:03;"And then they just like tally it up."
06:03;06:07;"Isn't the rule that you pay $40,000 and you get in?"
06:07;06:09;"I thought that was--"
06:09;06:10;"I think it's more than that."
06:10;06:11;"It's part of that, maybe."
06:11;06:13;"I think it added zero."
06:13;06:14;"Oh, OK."
06:14;06:15;"No, but--"
06:15;06:17;"so but this makes it sound like this"
06:17;06:20;"was sort of an honorary award that you're just getting there."
06:20;06:21;"No, no, but also--"
06:21;06:22;"We're not even voting on you."
06:22;06:23;"Probably people voted for her."
06:23;06:28;"But I could imagine she calls up the president of the rock hall"
06:28;06:30;"and says, ""There has to be some kind of mistake."""
06:30;06:33;"I bet he took the time and got on Zoom with her"
06:33;06:35;"and said, ""Well, Dolly, first of all,"
06:35;06:38;"the roots of country and rock are so interrelated."""
06:38;06:39;"And he probably listed a bunch of artists"
06:39;06:43;"we think of as country-ish who are already in the hall."
06:43;06:46;"Johnny Cash recorded for Sun Records, Carl Perkins."
06:46;06:49;"You know, you're part of the same lineage as all this stuff."
06:49;06:51;"And he probably made a strong case for it."
06:51;06:54;"And she probably was like, ""OK, I see what you mean."""
06:54;06:56;"And then also the most important part is he said,"
06:56;06:58;"""And either way, you're getting in the hall."
06:58;07:00;"You got two choices."
07:00;07:00;"Come willingly."""
07:00;07:03;"(both laughing)"
07:03;07:04;"Are we throwing you in the car"
07:04;07:06;"and take you down to the station?"
07:06;07:06;"And--"
07:06;07:07;"It can get pretty ugly."
07:07;07:08;"It can get pretty ugly."
07:08;07:10;"Well, I'm a nice guy,"
07:10;07:14;"but some of the other boys down at the hall, not so nice."
07:14;07:16;"Was it a friend of the show, Jerry Garcia,"
07:16;07:17;"who didn't attend?"
07:17;07:19;"He didn't attend when the dead, yeah."
07:19;07:20;"The rest of the dead."
07:20;07:22;"They had a cardboard cutout of Jerry."
07:22;07:23;"Right, right."
07:23;07:25;"They couldn't drag him down there."
07:25;07:30;"I just love this image of Dolly in her mansion"
07:30;07:31;"tossing and turning all night."
07:31;07:34;"Just like, ""How can I be in the rock hall of fame?"
07:34;07:38;"I haven't made a single star-studded double rock album."""
07:38;07:41;"There are so many deserving candidates."
07:41;07:43;"It's just like, yeah."
07:43;07:46;"From Rage Against the Machine to Warren Zeevon"
07:46;07:48;"that deserve to be in there before me."
07:48;07:52;"I mean, golly, even Pavement's eligible at this point."
07:52;07:56;"Gonna put a little country girl like me in the hall?"
07:56;07:57;"Oh."
07:57;07:59;"They really need to start acknowledging"
07:59;08:00;"the '90s Matador catalog."
08:00;08:03;"From Liz Phair to GB Vita Pavement."
08:03;08:04;"Hell, Yola Tango."
08:04;08:09;"I mean, Yola Tango's been around since the '80s."
08:09;08:10;"They're eligible."
08:10;08:13;"Oh, before Yola Tango."
08:13;08:14;"I bet she was talking with her manager"
08:14;08:18;"and he was like, ""Dolly, just record a rock album."
08:18;08:19;"Get Yola Tango."
08:19;08:24;"Get Ira Kaplan to rip a solo."""

09:03;09:06;"hopefully there was no guilt here."
09:06;09:07;"Hopefully it was just her,"
09:07;09:11;"maybe just being, finding it as a kind of sweet surprise"
09:11;09:12;"that she was inducted."
09:12;09:15;"And she said, ""Maybe just for fun, I'll make a rock album."""
09:15;09:17;"I'm dying to hear these rock originals."
09:17;09:18;"Yeah, we're gonna have to wait a minute."
09:18;09:20;"I wonder what kind of style it is."
09:20;09:21;"Like what kind of rock?"
09:21;09:25;"She might actually be doing a kind of a postmodern,"
09:25;09:27;"interesting takedown of the whole concept of rock."
09:27;09:30;"'Cause when you look through some of these songs,"
09:30;09:33;"you get like a ""Purple Rain"""
09:33;09:37;"by the famously multi-genre Prince."
09:37;09:38;"A song like ""Purple Rain,"""
09:38;09:42;"there's elements of R&B and gospel in that song as well."
09:42;09:45;"Then you get like ""Every Breath You Take"" by Sting."
09:45;09:47;"Kind of like a beautiful ballad,"
09:47;09:49;"famously sampled in hip hop."
09:49;09:52;"She got track 14, ""Wrecking Ball,"""
09:52;09:55;"featuring Miley Cyrus, of course."
09:55;09:57;"Most people say ""Wrecking Ball"" is a pop song."
09:57;09:59;"It's sort of interesting to see if she made it rock."
09:59;10:00;"- Rock arrangement."
10:00;10:02;"- It's not hard to picture that song"
10:02;10:05;"in kind of like goth metal vein."
10:05;10:07;"""Heart of Glass"" featuring Debbie Harry."
10:07;10:12;"""Stairway to Heaven"" featuring Lizzo and Sasha Flute."
10:12;10:13;"- Wow, that's a big swing."
10:13;10:16;"Wait, who's Sasha Flute?"
10:16;10:18;"- I think that's Lizzo's flute, right?"
10:18;10:20;"- Oh, I didn't, does she play flute?"
10:20;10:21;"- Of course. - Yeah."
10:21;10:23;"- There's like recorder on ""Stairway to Heaven,"" right?"
10:23;10:26;"You think she did those? - Yeah, good call."
10:26;10:28;"- She probably re-recorded that on flute."
10:28;10:30;"(gentle guitar music)"
10:30;10:32;"- Oh yeah, you're right, it is a flute."
10:32;10:35;"I didn't know her flute had a name."
10:35;10:42;"- Are these recorders that come in?"
10:42;10:45;"- Do you think that it's, that might be, are those flutes?"
10:45;10:47;"- I think that's harmonized recorders."
10:47;10:49;"- That's cool."
10:49;10:51;"- That'll sound great with Lizzo and Sasha Flute doing it."
10:51;10:52;"(gentle piano music)"
10:52;10:54;"♪ There's a lady ♪"
10:54;10:56;"- Yeah, Dolly's voice will sound great on this."
10:56;10:59;"All right, that's what I'm looking forward to the most."
10:59;11:01;"Okay, this one you know is gonna be hard."
11:01;11:04;"Track 22, ""Bygones,"" featuring Rob Halford"
11:04;11:09;"with special guests Nikki Sixx and John Five."
11:09;11:11;"Wait, is Nikki Sixx's bass called John Five?"
11:11;11:13;"Maybe it's a five-string bass?"
11:13;11:16;"- Like, people's instruments start becoming featured."
11:16;11:19;"- John William Lowry, best known by his stage name,"
11:19;11:21;"John Five is an American guitarist."
11:21;11:22;"- Okay."
11:22;11:23;"- What bands was he in?"
11:23;11:26;"- Stage name was bestowed on him in '88,"
11:26;11:28;"when he left David Lee Ross' solo band"
11:28;11:30;"and joined Marilyn Manson."
11:30;11:31;"- In '88?"
11:31;11:32;"- Not familiar with John Five."
11:32;11:34;"- He's played for Rob Zombie."
11:34;11:35;"He's got a look."
11:35;11:37;"- Oh, you see, that's gonna be the hard song."
11:37;11:38;"- Yeah."
11:38;11:39;"- Oh, sorry, 1998."
11:39;11:42;"- Track 24, ""What's Up,"" featuring Linda Perry."
11:42;11:43;"Great classic four-non-blonde song."
11:43;11:44;"- Straight up."
11:44;11:46;"- I've never heard of something like this"
11:46;11:49;"where there's so many covers featuring the original artist."
11:49;11:50;"- That's gonna be interesting."
11:50;11:52;"And then of course, closing it all out,"
11:52;11:56;"track 30, ""Free Bird,"" featuring Ronnie Van Zant"
11:56;12:00;"with special guests Gary Rossington, Artemis Pyle,"
12:00;12:02;"and the Artemis Pyle Band."
12:02;12:03;"Wow."
12:03;12:04;"- That's gonna be beautiful."
12:04;12:06;"- All right, six months to go."
12:06;12:09;"- We'll have to do a full app on the Dolly Rock album."
12:09;12:11;"- Oh yeah, very excited for that."
12:11;12:12;"I wonder if track one, ""Rockstar,"""
12:12;12:15;"is a cover of the N.E.R.D. song."
12:15;12:16;"- Wait, which song?"
12:16;12:16;"- You know that one, Jake?"
12:16;12:18;"Do you know who N.E.R.D. is?"
12:18;12:18;"Nerd?"
12:18;12:20;"- Oh, no, I don't."
12:20;12:23;"But I mean, I've seen that name, that acronym, but."
12:23;12:24;"- Do you know whose project that is?"
12:24;12:25;"- No."
12:25;12:26;"- Pharrell?"
12:26;12:28;"- Okay, yep, that rings a bell."
12:28;12:29;"Was it a rock band?"
12:29;12:30;"- Kind of."
12:30;12:34;"They famously recorded like two versions"
12:34;12:35;"of their first album."
12:35;12:37;"Do you guys remember this?"
12:37;12:39;"So N.E.R.D., it was, at this point,"
12:39;12:42;"the Neptunes were probably the biggest producers"
12:42;12:46;"in the world coming into like the early 2000s."
12:46;12:49;"But they, you know, Pharrell and Chad,"
12:49;12:52;"and you know, they were kind of like skateboarding."
12:52;12:56;"They're probably somewhat familiar with like punk music."
12:56;12:57;"Or at least, you know, they talk."
12:57;12:58;"- There's also like a lot,"
12:58;13:00;"I mean, this is more live instrumentation."
13:00;13:02;"There's also a lot of soul"
13:02;13:04;"and sort of more chord melody stuff."
13:04;13:05;"I mean, it's not all, yeah."
13:05;13:06;"- It's not all like hard."
13:06;13:09;"It's actually a very interesting, important album,"
13:09;13:11;"the first one, at this kind of like,"
13:11;13:15;"some might say brutal moment of rap rock."
13:15;13:17;"And them doing something that you could call rap rock,"
13:17;13:19;"but really was kind of like the best of,"
13:19;13:24;"like true alternative hip hop soul rock."
13:24;13:26;"Definitely like paved the way for like Odd Future and Tyler."
13:26;13:29;"But they recorded a rock version of the album"
13:29;13:30;"with like live drums."
13:30;13:32;"Is that the one that came out?"
13:32;13:34;"And then there was also like another version"
13:34;13:36;"that was all drum machine."

14:53;14:54;"- The Beatles are reuniting."
14:54;14:56;"- Wait, how many of the Beatles did she get?"
14:56;14:57;"- She get Ringo?"
14:57;15:00;"- Let It Be featuring Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr"
15:00;15:03;"with special guests Peter Frampton and Mick Fleetwood."
15:03;15:04;"It'd be the greatest album."
15:04;15:05;"- Two drummers?"
15:05;15:07;"(laughing)"
15:07;15:09;"- Maybe Ringo's gonna sing?"
15:09;15:11;"This album's gonna be bananas."
15:11;15:14;"There's always been an interesting rumor about Dolly Parton,"
15:14;15:15;"which might have something to do"
15:15;15:17;"with her interest in rock music,"
15:17;15:20;"but I've heard people say that she always wears long sleeves,"
15:20;15:21;"which you will find."
15:21;15:23;"You look through pictures of her, you can see a lot,"
15:23;15:25;"very consistently wearing long sleeves,"
15:25;15:27;"because, I don't know why she wants to hide this,"
15:27;15:30;"but because each arm is fully tatted out,"
15:30;15:32;"like full sleeves."
15:32;15:32;"- Really?"
15:33;15:35;"- I think it was being kind of rock."
15:35;15:37;"It's not exclusively rock, I guess."
15:37;15:38;"- From what era though?"
15:38;15:41;"I mean, not like, she didn't have that in the 70s."
15:41;15:42;"- No idea."
15:42;15:45;"- People weren't sleeved out in the 70s,"
15:45;15:46;"the way they are now."
15:46;15:48;"- Yeah, that feels like a 90s look."
15:48;15:50;"- I would say even twos."
15:50;15:54;"Like, I would say that started becoming commonplace"
15:54;15:56;"in mid twos."
15:56;15:58;"- It's also just an interesting concept."
15:58;16:01;"You're a beloved, iconic country singer,"
16:01;16:04;"and you just want to get full tattoo sleeves,"
16:04;16:06;"and you're like, ""This is just for me."
16:06;16:09;"I'll go to the trouble of wearing long sleeves"
16:09;16:11;"in public for the rest of my life."""
16:11;16:11;"- Like if she's on stage,"
16:11;16:14;"she's like hiding it from the audience."
16:14;16:15;"- Can we get any confirmation?"
16:15;16:17;"- Yeah, well, she does have tattoos."
16:17;16:17;"So according to her,"
16:17;16:19;"and there's also a lot of people"
16:19;16:21;"trying to get to the bottom of this."
16:21;16:23;"Country Living Magazine seems pretty invested."
16:23;16:27;"But here's the quote from Dolly."
16:27;16:29;"""Most of my tattoos, when I first started,"
16:29;16:31;"I was covering up some scars that I had"
16:31;16:33;"'cause I have a tendency to have,"
16:33;16:35;"is it keloid scar tissue?"
16:35;16:36;"Keloid scar tissue? - Keloid, yeah."
16:36;16:37;"- Keloid scar tissue."
16:37;16:39;"And I have a tendency where if I have"
16:39;16:41;"any kind of scars anywhere,"
16:41;16:42;"then they kind of have a purple tinge"
16:42;16:44;"and I can never get rid of them,"" she added."
16:44;16:47;"""So mine are pastel, what few that I have."
16:47;16:49;"And they're meant to cover some scars."
16:49;16:51;"I'm not trying to make some big, bold statement."""
16:51;16:52;"- I do not have full sleeves."
16:52;16:53;"- I do not have full sleeves."
16:53;16:56;"- I repeat, I do not have full sleeves."
16:56;16:58;"All right, she has a few tattoos."
16:58;16:59;"- Okay."
16:59;17:02;"- She's conscious about the keloid scars."
17:02;17:04;"All right, regardless, can't wait."
17:04;17:07;"- She also says, ""I do have some tattoos, that's true,"
17:07;17:09;"but they're tasteful."
17:09;17:10;"I'm not a tattoo girl."""
17:10;17:13;"- These conversations are so weird."
17:13;17:16;"Just like, now I actually don't know what to think anymore."
17:16;17:17;"Dolly, we already have a lot of tattoos."
17:17;17:18;"I have some."
17:18;17:19;"- Pushing back a little too hard."
17:19;17:21;"- What do you think, I'm some kind of tattoo girl?"
17:21;17:24;"What do you think, got full sleeves?"
17:24;17:26;"Do I look like the type of person who had full sleeves?"
17:26;17:27;"Absolutely not."
17:27;17:28;"- I'm 85 years old."
17:28;17:29;"- Dude, not at full sleeves."
17:29;17:31;"- How old is Dolly Parton, by the way?"
17:31;17:33;"- I think she's 80."
17:33;17:34;"- Willie Nelson just turned 90."
17:34;17:36;"- Oh yeah, there was a thing at the Hollywood Bowl, right?"
17:36;17:37;"- Yeah."
17:37;17:38;"- She's 77."
17:38;17:39;"- Okay."
17:39;17:40;"We love you either way, Dolly."
17:40;17:45;"Full sleeves, a few tasteful tattoos, you're a legend."
17:45;17:47;"Well, today's a unique day."
17:47;17:52;"It happens to be a time crisis on the 10th anniversary"
17:52;17:55;"of modern vampires of the city."
17:55;17:56;"- Hey-oh!"
17:56;17:58;"I can't believe it's been 10 years."
17:58;18:00;"I mean, I kind of can."
18:00;18:03;"- Feels like eight years to me."
18:03;18:05;"- Yeah, all right, so it's not that weird."
18:05;18:06;"Eight and a half years."
18:06;18:08;"(laughing)"
18:08;18:11;"18 months can't account for, but,"
18:11;18:13;"and I guess also like when an album came out,"
18:13;18:15;"you know, for me it goes back further"
18:15;18:20;"'cause of course we're working on this for about two years."
18:20;18:21;"- Yeah."
18:21;18:23;"- Some of the songs have even deeper roots than that."
18:23;18:25;"So, you know, you gotta add to it."
18:25;18:27;"Now you're talking about 12 years, you know."
18:27;18:30;"- Were you kind of living out here"
18:30;18:31;"when that record came out?"
18:31;18:34;"'Cause I remember kind of hanging out with you a bunch"
18:34;18:35;"around that, so it was 2013."
18:35;18:37;"- Yeah, although I also have a memory"
18:37;18:39;"of hanging out in New York too."
18:39;18:40;"As I've told you before,"
18:40;18:43;"I remember playing you the song ""Unbelievers."""
18:43;18:45;"You seemed a little bit underwhelmed."
18:45;18:47;"- Where were we?"
18:47;18:49;"- I think we were in my apartment in Manhattan."
18:49;18:50;"- Okay."
18:50;18:52;"- Not negative, I just kind of remember you being like,"
18:52;18:53;"""All right."""
18:53;18:54;"- Cool, man."
18:54;18:56;"- You're like, ""Okay."""
18:56;18:57;"- I get it."
18:57;18:59;"It's always tough when people play you music"
18:59;19:02;"'cause you know me, I'm also kind of like a straight shooter"
19:02;19:05;"and I'm not super effusive."
19:05;19:06;"So if I'm like--"
19:06;19:06;"- No, but that makes you a great person to play."
19:06;19:10;"- If I'm just like, ""Dude, I'm blown away right now."""
19:10;19:10;"(laughing)"
19:10;19:13;"Like, that would not ring true."
19:13;19:16;"Although I do remember when you played me,"
19:16;19:18;"why am I blanking on the song?"
19:18;19:21;"The second song on ""Father of the Bride."""
19:21;19:21;"- Oh, ""Harmony Hall."""
19:21;19:22;"- ""Harmony Hall."""
19:22;19:25;"- I was like, ""Damn, boys, you hit it out of the park."""
19:25;19:27;"- Maybe that one was more in your wheelhouse."
19:27;19:28;"And I guess there's something also like,"
19:28;19:31;"""Unbelievers"" is kind of like a straightforward song."
19:31;19:33;"Also, before we get into ""Modern Vampires,"""
19:33;19:36;"also have to say thank you to you, Jake,"
19:36;19:40;"because we sent you your plaque for this life."
19:40;19:40;"- You're welcome?"
19:40;19:41;"- From ""Father of the Bride."""
19:41;19:42;"I mean, that's our thank you to you"
19:42;19:47;"because this life is officially a gold single."
19:47;19:49;"That means it's sold the equivalent."
19:49;19:50;"(laughing)"
19:50;19:51;"- Not actual."
19:51;19:54;"- Yeah, I mean, in the streaming age, it's different."
19:54;19:59;"It's done 500,000 units in the US or more."
19:59;20:00;"And for people who don't remember,"
20:00;20:03;"Jake plays a short, tasteful solo."
20:03;20:05;"- When I got it, I was so excited."
20:05;20:06;"I mean, I don't have any-"
20:06;20:08;"- Is that your first gold plaque?"
20:08;20:10;"- I don't have any awards."
20:10;20:12;"This was an exciting moment for me."
20:12;20:13;"I texted you and Arielle."
20:13;20:16;"I said, ""Where would that song have been without my solo?"""
20:16;20:17;"- Let's listen to that real quick"
20:17;20:18;"before we get into ""Modern Vampires."""
20:20;20:21;"Where's Jake's solo?"
20:21;20:23;"- Around the three-minute mark probably."
20:23;20:24;"- Yeah."
20:24;20:26;"♪ Probably hasn't happened yet ♪"
20:26;20:31;"♪ 'Cause I don't remember living life before this ♪"
20:31;20:37;"♪ And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees ♪"
20:37;20:42;"♪ Unaware that they've been living in a forest ♪"

20:47;20:50;"♪ Hoo hoo ♪"
20:50;20:52;"- There it is. - There it is, folks."
20:52;20:54;"Mastery on my instrument right there."
20:54;20:56;"(imitating guitar)"
20:56;20:59;"- Jake, what do you remember about playing that solo?"
20:59;21:01;"- I remember I'd never heard the song before,"
21:01;21:04;"and they said, ""Just play along, man."""
21:04;21:05;"- Wow."
21:05;21:06;"- And I was like, ""What key is it?"""
21:06;21:09;"And they're like, ""They just started,"" you know, and just."
21:09;21:13;"I kind of like noodled aimlessly over the song once."
21:13;21:14;"- That's classic Arielle."
21:14;21:15;"He wants people's first thought, best thought."
21:15;21:18;"- Yeah, and then somehow that made it in the edit."
21:18;21:19;"- In one take?"
21:19;21:21;"- One take Jake over here, dude."
21:21;21:23;"- That's right, one take Jake."
21:23;21:26;"- And when we saw you play in the park, Jake played."
21:26;21:29;"And is that the only time you've ever played this live?"
21:29;21:32;"- Wait, what park?"
21:32;21:33;"- Do you remember there was an early?"
21:33;21:36;"(imitating guitar)"
21:36;21:37;"You don't even remember."
21:37;21:38;"Do you remember there was an early?"
21:38;21:39;"- I remember that."
21:39;21:42;"- Oh, there's also a very classic Seinfeld tea,"
21:42;21:45;"Earth Day tea from this. - Oh, yeah, yeah."
21:45;21:46;"Oh, in Griffith Park. - Over 20 days."
21:46;21:47;"- I don't think I played."
21:47;21:49;"- You did, I have a video of it."
21:49;21:51;"- I played along with a band?"
21:51;21:53;"- Maybe you jumped in for a second."
21:53;21:54;"- I'm gonna find this video. - It was so loose."
21:54;21:55;"- I don't remember. - It was a loose"
21:55;21:57;"acoustic concert, no."
21:57;21:59;"- I certainly didn't recreate that solo."
21:59;22:00;"- No amplification."
22:00;22:01;"- So where is it hanging?"
22:01;22:02;"Where's the gold plaque hanging?"
22:02;22:05;"- It's hanging in. (imitating guitar)"
22:05;22:06;"- In your baby's room?"
22:06;22:08;"- It's hanging in my studio bathroom."
22:08;22:10;"- Mine's in the bathroom too."
22:10;22:11;"- I feel great about it, 'cause I see it, you know,"
22:11;22:14;"I see it three, four times a day."
22:14;22:15;"- It really is a tradition."
22:15;22:17;"The first time I really saw a lot of gold"
22:17;22:22;"and platinum records was at XL offices in London."
22:22;22:26;"It's on like a muse in Ladbroke Grove,"
22:26;22:28;"you know, like a, we would call it like an alley,"
22:28;22:31;"but like a really tasteful, cozy little house lined alley."
22:31;22:34;"So they have like a house, and then you like go in,"
22:34;22:36;"and there's like cool wallpaper and stuff"
22:36;22:38;"all over the place, like such a great feeling,"
22:38;22:41;"like to go in there, and it was like 23,"
22:41;22:44;"London signing to a label, amazing vibe."
22:44;22:46;"And then you go, there's like two bathrooms,"
22:46;22:50;"and they're just like wall to wall, loaded with dozens,"
22:50;22:53;"basement jacks, the Prodigy, White Stripes,"
22:53;22:55;"MIA, all that stuff."
22:55;22:56;"And then I realized, oh, okay,"
22:56;22:57;"that's what you're supposed to do,"
22:57;22:58;"you put it in the bathroom."
22:58;23:00;"You give it too much pride of place,"
23:00;23:02;"you're being-- - It's weird."
23:02;23:06;"- Weird energy, and then also stuff it in the basement,"
23:06;23:09;"have some pride, there's only one place you could put it."
23:09;23:10;"- Bathroom."
23:10;23:11;"- Or of course, I guess some, of course,"
23:11;23:14;"if you actually like have your own studio, sure,"
23:14;23:16;"you put it in like the waiting room at the studio."
23:16;23:18;"- That seems a little-- - Yeah, that seems much."
23:18;23:20;"- You're flexing a little hard there."
23:20;23:21;"- That's true."
23:21;23:23;"- Well, I'm glad that I'm following"
23:23;23:25;"in the footsteps of the tradition,"
23:25;23:26;"'cause I didn't even know that."
23:26;23:29;"I just, I got it delivered to my studio,"
23:29;23:30;"and I unwrapped it."
23:30;23:32;"- Did you know it was coming?"
23:32;23:34;"- Yes, this was arranged over email"
23:34;23:36;"I heard from Ezra's management."
23:36;23:38;"- Oh, okay, I should've surprised you."
23:38;23:43;"- And it was dropped off, and I unwrapped it immediately,"
23:43;23:44;"put a nail in the wall, and hung it."
23:44;23:47;"- When the album goes gold,"
23:47;23:50;"I'll be sending some to the Crisis Crew."
23:50;23:50;"- Great."
23:50;23:53;"- Can cast a wider net for the album."
23:53;23:53;"- So we're all on the album."
23:53;23:57;"- So working at Seinfeld, and I feel like it's even"
23:57;23:59;"hanging it in our bathroom is a bit much,"
23:59;24:02;"considering, I mean, I understand, it's a nice gift,"
24:02;24:04;"but because we're not actually involved in its production."
24:04;24:07;"- I've seen them all, like, I remember back in the day"
24:07;24:10;"at the Other Music record store in New York,"
24:10;24:14;"they would have a bunch hanging behind the cash register,"
24:14;24:18;"because they'd be like, or sometimes you go to a radio"
24:18;24:21;"person's office, and there's a DJ who'll break a song."
24:21;24:22;"You don't always have to be--"
24:22;24:24;"- So you can gift them, I didn't realize this."
24:24;24:26;"- I think you can gift them to anybody."
24:26;24:29;"It's actually interesting, there's a handful of these places"
24:29;24:33;"that make them, but you do need that RIAA certification."
24:33;24:35;"So you might think, oh, I could go start making"
24:35;24:39;"some gag ones, congratulations on this and that,"
24:39;24:41;"go in 10 times platinum or something,"
24:41;24:44;"but these places are official, and they get a lot of work"
24:44;24:47;"from the biz, and they'll say, let me stop you right there."
24:47;24:50;"If you don't have that RIAA certification,"
24:50;24:51;"you can get the hell out of here."
24:51;24:55;"We're not doing dad of the year trophies over here."
24:55;24:57;"This is a serious business."
24:57;25:01;"- That Diamond Mountain Brews album I've been trying to"
25:01;25:03;"get made for Jake for Christmas."
25:03;25:04;"- But how do they check the certification?"
25:04;25:06;"'Cause could you not get that counterfeited"
25:06;25:09;"and then bring it to the other place?"
25:09;25:11;"- Like, is there a place, are they in direct communication"
25:11;25:13;"with the RIAA?"
25:13;25:14;"- Yeah, and they must be using some type"
25:14;25:19;"of quantum computing, I think, to check in with the RIAA."
25:19;25:22;"Yeah, they must be directly in contact with them."
25:22;25:23;"- They got a direct line."
25:23;25:25;"- You probably have to wait until the RIAA"
25:25;25:27;"puts it on their website."
25:27;25:28;"- Okay."
25:28;25:29;"- I was gonna say really quickly too,"
25:29;25:32;"this also opened up a can of worms that we touched on"
25:32;25:35;"in a previous episode regarding my royalties."
25:35;25:38;"- Oh yeah, 'cause last time we talked about your royalties,"
25:38;25:41;"we were talking about the fact that Vampire Weekend"
25:41;25:44;"had performed your classic song, ""Mountain Brews"""
25:44;25:45;"at Red Rocks."
25:45;25:47;"And I know that there is, you hand in the set list"
25:47;25:48;"and we talked about this."
25:48;25:49;"- Yeah, yeah."
25:49;25:52;"- Live performance, there is a performance royalty"
25:52;25:54;"that somehow ASCAP divvies up."
25:54;25:57;"But what we didn't think about is that you did perform"
25:57;25:59;"on a gold single."
25:59;26:00;"That might actually be, I don't know,"
26:00;26:02;"a few thousand bucks or something."
26:02;26:03;"- Gotta track this down."
26:03;26:05;"- Yeah, we gotta get you registered."
26:05;26:07;"- With ASCAP or BMI?"
26:07;26:09;"- I think you gotta meet with some representatives"
26:09;26:11;"of each organization and decide who you want."
26:11;26:11;"- Okay."
26:11;26:13;"- Collecting on your behalf."
26:13;26:16;"Well, then it gets weird too, because for all we know,"
26:16;26:18;"and this is real, with this life, it's actually possible"
26:18;26:22;"because ""Mountain Brews"" you played once in the US,"
26:22;26:25;"this life theoretically been played here and there"
26:25;26:28;"in other places, you might have five bucks on the table"
26:28;26:31;"in Romania, you might have $2 in the Philippines,"
26:31;26:32;"that kind of stuff."
26:32;26:32;"- Let's track that down."
26:32;26:34;"- This stuff all adds up."
26:34;26:34;"That actually would be interesting."
26:34;26:36;"I'll get somebody on it."
26:36;26:40;"- But back to the album with the 10 years,"
26:40;26:42;"there is a ""Modern Vampires"" gold record"
26:42;26:43;"that's in my parents' house."
26:43;26:45;"- Where is it hanging up in your parents' house?"
26:45;26:48;"- They have the three gold records"
26:48;26:51;"from the first three albums in this,"
26:51;26:52;"basically the living room."
26:52;26:55;"There's a little nook where the piano is."
26:55;26:58;"So it makes sense in like a music room."
26:58;26:59;"And they look good together."
26:59;27:01;"When I'm at my parents' house, see them,"
27:01;27:02;"feel like, yeah, this is where these belong."
27:02;27:06;"- Now, 10 years ago, what did gold mean?"
27:06;27:09;"As opposed to now when it's the equivalent"
27:09;27:11;"of 500,000 sold, was it?"
27:11;27:13;"- My memory is that ""Modern Vampires"" was the era"
27:13;27:15;"when streaming was just kind of starting."
27:15;27:16;"- Yeah."
27:16;27:21;"- So, you know, even then there was like digital sales"
27:21;27:23;"and digital single sales that they would add up"
27:23;27:25;"into a formula and stuff like that."
27:25;27:27;"- What year was the first record?"
27:27;27:28;"- 2008."
27:28;27:30;"- Okay, so picture this,"
27:30;27:32;"there's a band puts out a record in '68."
27:32;27:33;"- Yeah."
27:33;27:35;"- And then the next one was the next year."
27:35;27:37;"- No, the next one was 2010."
27:37;27:38;"- Okay, so '68."
27:38;27:39;"- '68, '70."
27:39;27:40;"- '73. - '73."
27:40;27:41;"- And then."
27:41;27:42;"- '79."
27:42;27:44;"- That's where it gets weird."
27:44;27:45;"- That's basically."
27:45;27:46;"- It's like post-punk, post-disco."
27:46;27:48;"- You're basically talking about ""Shakedown Street"""
27:48;27:51;"or ""Go to Heaven"" if we're talking about ""The Grateful Dead."""
27:51;27:53;"Yeah, you start in like '67, '68."
27:53;27:55;"By the time you're releasing"
27:55;27:57;"the ""Father of the Bride"" type album,"
27:57;27:58;"you're fully in the punk disco."
27:58;28:00;"You're basically in the hip hop era."
28:00;28:01;"- Yeah, it's weird."
28:01;28:04;"- ""Rapper's Delight"" has been released at that point."
28:04;28:08;"- Yeah, there's a coherence in those first five years,"
28:08;28:13;"whether it's '68 to '73 or '08 to '13."
28:13;28:15;"- Yeah, I think that's true for everybody."
28:15;28:17;"I mean, I've always been so interested"
28:17;28:18;"in the numerology of careers"
28:18;28:22;"and kind of felt like everybody's got their first five years."
28:22;28:23;"- Yep."
28:23;28:24;"- There's exceptions to the rule, but generally speaking,"
28:24;28:28;"it's like you come out, got five years, make a mark."
28:28;28:30;"Try to release more than one album if you can."
28:30;28:33;"Three, hell, some people do four."
28:33;28:34;"But yeah, you come out,"
28:34;28:36;"that's when you build the crux of your career."
28:36;28:38;"Then you have the next five years,"
28:38;28:41;"which if you've done okay,"
28:41;28:43;"there's still kind of heat and stuff."
28:43;28:46;"But I've always felt like once you're in the second decade,"
28:46;28:50;"which for us started, I guess, in 2018,"
28:50;28:51;"you're in the twilight zone."
28:51;28:54;"Have some fun with it, but you're in the twilight zone."
28:54;28:57;"- I remember in that Pearl Jam doc,"
28:57;28:59;"I think it was called ""PJ20."""
28:59;29:00;"- Mm-hmm."
29:00;29:02;"- And camera crew asked Eddie Vedder,"
29:02;29:04;"I mean, yeah, he sets it up in a similar way."
29:04;29:07;"He's like, ""In the first 10 years of this band,"
29:07;29:09;"""how did the second 10 years happen?"""
29:09;29:11;"And Eddie Vedder just has the most blank smile."
29:11;29:12;"(laughing)"
29:12;29:13;"And then it just cuts."
29:13;29:15;"And I was like, ""What?"
29:15;29:17;"""Like, (beep) damn, if you're gonna ask that question"
29:17;29:19;"""and he has no answer, then cut it out of the movie."""
29:19;29:21;"But he's just sort of like,"
29:21;29:22;"(laughing)"
29:22;29:25;"""Yeah, man, I don't know."
29:25;29:26;"""I have no idea."""
29:26;29:28;"- I mean, Pearl Jam had definitely,"
29:28;29:30;"they were thriving as a live act in the second 10,"
29:30;29:31;"and they did their thing."
29:31;29:32;"- Yeah, absolutely."
29:32;29:34;"- I think from a Pearl Jam fan's perspective,"
29:34;29:38;"there's some very solid material in the second 10 years."
29:38;29:41;"But yeah, I think the second 10 is a,"
29:41;29:42;"I don't wanna say difficult time,"
29:42;29:43;"I'm definitely not complaining,"
29:43;29:46;"but I think the second 10, it's just funny."
29:46;29:49;"It's just a fully different energy."
29:49;29:52;"And anyway, yeah, your expectations have to be different,"
29:52;29:54;"but I think it could also be a very positive thing."
29:54;29:57;"- Now, Ezra, in terms of this album"
29:57;29:58;"coming at the dawn of streaming,"
29:58;29:59;"let me ask you this."
30:00;30:02;"Was ""Modern Vampires"" on Turntable.fm?"
30:02;30:05;"And did you see any royalties from that?"
30:05;30:09;"- Was Turntable.fm where people have Scrabbles?"
30:09;30:10;"- Yeah, I don't know about the Scrabbles."
30:10;30:11;"What's a Scrabble?"
30:11;30:13;"- I have a memory, for all I know,"
30:13;30:14;"this is a huge thing."
30:14;30:17;"There was a time when, I'm digging deep into my memory,"
30:17;30:19;"where people would have Scrabbles."
30:19;30:21;"They would, a Scrabble would be like--"
30:21;30:22;"- On Last.fm."
30:22;30:23;"- Oh, that's Last.fm."
30:23;30:27;"- Oh, Last, track the music you listen to by Scrabble."
30:27;30:28;"- Okay, I've never heard of a Scrabble."
30:28;30:30;"So what's a Scrabble?"
30:30;30:32;"- I think a Scrabble is,"
30:32;30:33;"I think basically you just post"
30:33;30:35;"what you've been listening to on Last.fm,"
30:35;30:39;"which maybe is not as necessary in the streaming era."
30:39;30:41;"- Now, Turntable.fm was where you could"
30:41;30:43;"sort of have a virtual DJ room."
30:43;30:46;"You could enter and you could play your tracks"
30:46;30:48;"for other listeners."
30:48;30:52;"- Seinfeld, was that pizza too spicy?"
30:52;30:54;"You all right?"
30:54;30:56;"- I feel like I'm coming down with something"
30:56;30:58;"and I apologize, but I'm saying,"
30:58;31:00;"it was almost like a precursor to the metaverse,"
31:00;31:01;"which I know we're all on."
31:01;31:04;"And you could go in there and you had an avatar"
31:04;31:07;"and you could DJ a set for a group of others."
31:07;31:09;"- Whoa."
31:09;31:10;"- In the chat room."
31:10;31:12;"Do you remember this, Jake, were you on Turntable.fm?"
31:12;31:13;"- This is all new to me."
31:13;31:15;"- I sound crazy, but this is a real--"
31:15;31:18;"- Okay, yeah, maybe, I mean, maybe, I don't remember."
31:18;31:21;"Maybe there's some cool DJs spinning modern vampires"
31:21;31:23;"in the Turntable.fm club."
31:23;31:27;"And maybe that Turntable.fm love"
31:27;31:29;"turned into a few scrabbles for us on Last.fm."
31:29;31:30;"- I would hope so."
31:30;31:31;"- Scrabbles."
31:31;31:33;"- I don't care about sales."
31:33;31:34;"I don't care about money."
31:34;31:36;"I care about scrabbles."
31:36;31:40;"And modern vampires in the city was getting scrabbled."
31:40;31:44;"In 2013, we were getting scrabbled."
31:44;31:46;"- The fans were scrabbling it up."
31:46;31:47;"It was the dawn of a new era."
31:47;31:51;"- Have you listened to the record recently?"
31:51;31:53;"- No, but you know, I hear songs around."
31:53;31:54;"- Sure."
31:54;31:56;"- It's funny, 'cause you know, when we go on tour"
31:56;31:58;"and we're playing all the songs,"
31:58;32:00;"I have this feeling that I'm hearing them all the time,"
32:00;32:01;"but of course I'm not hearing the recordings."
32:01;32:03;"I'm hearing the live versions."
32:03;32:06;"So I'm thinking about the songs."
32:06;32:09;"No, I haven't thrown it on front to back in a long time."
32:09;32:12;"But also, I just feel like I know it inside and out."
32:12;32:14;"Maybe I'd be surprised."
32:14;32:15;"But I don't know, should we like,"
32:15;32:16;"do you guys have any questions?"
32:16;32:18;"Should we skip around through the album?"
32:18;32:22;"- I was gonna say, this album yielded one of the true,"
32:22;32:25;"late set staple, real banger, ""Ya Hey."""
32:25;32:28;"I feel like that's a classic, deep in the set,"
32:28;32:30;"like, core, or like, yeah."
32:30;32:32;"- We've closed with ""Ya Hey."""
32:32;32:33;"- Yeah."
32:33;32:37;"- And one fun fact is, we never performed ""Worship You"""
32:37;32:39;"in the modern Vampires era."
32:39;32:40;"I remember we rehearsed it a bit,"
32:40;32:43;"and it just felt a little too sloppy."
32:43;32:44;"That this song, you know, it's fine."
32:44;32:45;"- Throw it on."
32:45;32:49;"Oh yeah, this one."

33:35;33:38;"is probably my favorite stretch of the album."
33:38;33:40;"- ""Everlasting Arms,"" I think,"
33:40;33:42;"it's so hard to sometimes classify stuff,"
33:42;33:43;"and you do press,"

33:49;33:51;"but ""Everlasting Arms"" is my favorite song"
33:51;33:53;"in a certain category."
33:53;33:55;"You know, when it gets down to brass tacks,"

34:00;34:02;"No, I don't put it in the same category."
34:02;34:04;"Those songs, I feel,"
34:04;34:07;"may be more proud of the songwriting or something,"
34:07;34:10;"but ""Everlasting Arms,"" just the way it turned out,"

34:23;34:25;"- We have, right? - ""Hemes,"" and ""Danny Brown?"""
34:25;34:26;"- Yeah."

35:48;35:51;"about how to start off with a slow song."
35:51;35:52;"And you know, I just gotta remember,"
35:52;35:54;"we were known for A-Punk."
35:54;35:54;"- Right."
35:54;35:56;"- Still are, but you know,"
35:56;35:59;"we've kind of built a larger thing."
35:59;36:01;"So I remember sitting with Morg and telling him,"
36:01;36:02;"he was like, ""Oh, how's the new record going?"""
36:02;36:04;"And I was like, ""Well, I am a little self-conscious."
36:04;36:09;"""I just feel like it's a lot of slow, mid-tempo songs."""
36:09;36:12;"And I remember him saying, ""You know what?"
36:12;36:14;"""You guys have made two successful albums."
36:14;36:16;"""If you wanna have this album of no fast songs,"
36:16;36:18;"""all ballads, you earned that right."
36:18;36:19;"""And I think you should do it."""
36:19;36:21;"I just remember thinking like, ""Terrible advice."""
36:21;36:23;"I told him that when I talked to him last week."
36:23;36:25;"I said, ""You gave me terrible advice, man."""
36:25;36:25;"He's like, ""Oh, come on."""
36:25;36:27;"I was being supportive."
36:27;36:29;"But anyway, I did have this feeling like--"
36:29;36:30;"- That's hilarious."
36:30;36:32;"- Is this album so slow?"
36:32;36:34;"And now I hear ""Obvious Bicycle."""
36:34;36:36;"I'm like, ""Even that song's not slow."""
36:36;36:38;"But at the time, this song felt glacial."
36:38;36:40;"- It reads as ballad, though."
36:40;36:44;"It doesn't read as like, ""Here we go, fun time at the beach."""
36:44;36:46;"- Yes, it's somewhere in between,"
36:46;36:49;"but it's not full acoustic whispery."
36:49;36:50;"- No, no, no. - It's got a groove."
36:50;36:51;"And that was--"
36:51;36:54;"- I can't picture a vampire going full acoustic whispery."
36:54;36:56;"- Well, but there's moments on this record."
36:56;36:59;"I mean, a full album like that, I don't know."
36:59;37:02;"Anyway, so what's interesting about this song."
37:02;37:06;"So yeah, it started with this beautiful Rost and Piano part,"
37:06;37:08;"but then we got stuck on the drums for a long time,"
37:08;37:12;"and a big breakthrough is when Ariel entered the picture,"
37:12;37:14;"Ariel Rekshide."
37:14;37:17;"Rost and I had done quite a bit of work on the record first,"
37:17;37:19;"you know, a lot of ideas,"
37:19;37:21;"some songs pretty close to done,"
37:21;37:23;"some songs a little bit stuck on."
37:23;37:26;"And anyway, he came in right at the right moment."
37:26;37:29;"And he and I remember talking about Nyabingy drums,"
37:29;37:32;"which is a Nyabingy type of Jamaican music"
37:32;37:33;"that's like a classic rhythm,"
37:33;37:34;"and he had just been in Jamaica,"
37:34;37:38;"I think working on the Snoop Lion album with Diplo."
37:38;37:40;"And he'd actually spent time with Nyabingy drummers,"
37:40;37:43;"and some conversation I played him this song"
37:43;37:44;"that had those drums in it."
37:44;37:46;"And he was like, ""Let's just sample it."""
37:46;37:47;"And the next, now,"
37:47;37:51;"♪ Bum bum, dum dum, dum dum ♪"
37:51;37:54;"And that's more or less how that song came together."

38:54;38:56;"in Ross's apartment."
38:56;38:58;"He sat down, playing the first chorus,"
38:58;39:00;"started thinking of something."

39:28;39:30;"It never happened like that."

39:36;39:37;"- It was a great chorus."
39:37;39:38;"- Yeah."
39:38;39:38;"- I haven't heard this in a long time"
39:38;39:41;"and I was just like, oh yeah, this chorus."
39:41;39:43;"- And again, there was something about this song too,"
39:43;39:46;"at the time, it felt like very different territory."
39:46;39:48;"Now I look back and it's like,"
39:48;39:49;"first three albums all flow into each other."
39:49;39:52;"But at the time, this had like a little twang,"
39:52;39:54;"a little Americana, feeling like it was very different."
39:54;39:55;"- See, I don't hear that at all."

40:50;40:51;"I kind of feel like this is like"
40:51;40:53;"the greatest achievement of this album."
40:53;40:57;"This is inspired by the legendary Souls of Mischief,"
40:57;40:58;"their song ""Step to My Girl."""
40:58;41:00;"We talked about that years ago on the show."

41:29;41:30;"I don't know, maybe at the time"
41:30;41:32;"I thought the song was like different."

41:58;42:01;"- Oh, we did the thing with Steve Buscemi?"
42:01;42:03;"- Yeah, that Steve Buscemi interviewed you"
42:03;42:05;"and I remember him specifically calling out"
42:05;42:07;"the lyrics to this and him saying how,"
42:07;42:09;"like basically how you guys are so young,"
42:09;42:11;"how do you understand?"
42:11;42:12;"Is that in this?"
42:12;42:14;"- The feeling of the wisdom teeth being out?"

42:15;42:17;"- Oh, he was actually, was he being like earnest?"
42:17;42:18;"- No, he was being very earnest."
42:18;42:19;"- Oh, really?"
42:19;42:21;"- Yeah, there's a moment,"
42:21;42:21;"I don't know if it's in this song,"
42:21;42:24;"but Buscemi's interviewing you"
42:24;42:29;"and he's really moved by your understanding of aging."
42:29;42:32;"- Oh, that's interesting."
42:32;42:33;"It's funny, I thought more about aging"
42:33;42:38;"in my late 20s than I do now, in my late 30s."
42:38;42:40;"Late 20s is a difficult time."

42:41;42:43;"- Yeah, truly."

43:04;43:06;"- For me, this song is like, I've said this before,"
43:06;43:10;"all Vampire Weekend lyrics have deep meaning to me."
43:10;43:11;"- All of them?"
43:11;43:12;"- 92%."
43:12;43:13;"- Okay."
43:13;43:14;"- Let's say 92%."
43:14;43:18;"But when the first record came out,"
43:18;43:20;"yeah, there's some random lyrics,"
43:20;43:21;"but I still felt, I was like,"
43:21;43:22;"this is painting a picture for me."
43:22;43:25;"I'm not being random for the hell of it."
43:25;43:27;"But that was a classic early criticism."
43:27;43:29;"And I did have this feeling where,"
43:29;43:32;"I see a man's through the trees, that kind of song."
43:32;43:34;"It's impressionistic or M79,"
43:34;43:38;"very weird song about a bus with these weird images."
43:38;43:40;"And it's like the haters would be like,"
43:40;43:43;"this dude just lists off stuff, it sucks,"
43:43;43:44;"got nothing to say, whatever."
43:44;43:47;"We had a few haters."
43:47;43:48;"- You had a couple on the first record."
43:48;43:49;"- Yeah, we had a couple."
43:49;43:49;"- Just a few."
43:49;43:52;"- And on the second, third and fourth as well."
43:52;43:54;"But I just remember feeling like,"
43:54;43:56;"lyrically on this song, I did feel like this is when"
43:56;44:00;"the randomness of the words truly told a story."
44:00;44:01;"It really is about something."
44:01;44:03;"It's like, this song's impressionistic too,"
44:03;44:06;"but I felt like whatever lyrical"
44:06;44:08;"Mansard Roof M79 type stuff had started,"
44:08;44:10;"this is where it blossomed."
44:10;44:12;"- I mean, we've talked about this before with songwriting."
44:12;44:14;"I mean, if it's too straightforward,"
44:14;44:16;"it can be kind of flat."
44:16;44:19;"So, you know, or we've talked about songs"
44:19;44:21;"that kind of tell a story and then they kind of veer off"
44:21;44:23;"on the third verse and become--"
44:23;44:26;"- Yeah, or the perspective shifts."
44:26;44:28;"Suddenly there's like a, it was all about you"
44:28;44:29;"and then it's about I."
44:29;44:30;"- Right."
44:30;44:31;"- You're kind of like, why did that happen?"
44:31;44:33;"And sometimes there's real reason for it."
44:33;44:36;"(slow music)"
44:36;44:40;"- Can you play Jake the remix?"
44:40;44:42;"I want to get his impression of it."
44:42;44:44;"And you don't believe you've ever heard this."
44:44;44:45;"- Oh no, I'm sure I've heard it."

52:31;52:35;"I feel like it came together on Martha's Vineyard."

54:07;54:12;"This is, I was thinking about this recently"
54:12;54:15;"because I found this huge trove of like old high school"
54:15;54:18;"and recording and college recordings,"
54:18;54:20;"which maybe in the summer we'll do a Banked Up about."
54:20;54:21;"- Oh yeah."
54:21;54:24;"- This is one of the oldest Vampire Weekend songs."
54:24;54:25;"- Really?"
54:25;54:27;"- 'Cause before Vampire Weekend was a band,"
54:27;54:30;"kind of like wrote this song on acoustic guitar"
54:30;54:33;"as like a country song and kind of like sat on it"
54:33;54:35;"for a while."
54:35;54:37;"And I always thought this was a good song."
54:37;54:41;"And we tried working on it on Contra"
54:41;54:43;"because you know, at that point, like Contra,"
54:43;54:44;"we were working on Contra,"
54:44;54:46;"it was only out of college for three years."
54:46;54:49;"You know, let's say I'd written that song five years earlier."
54:49;54:52;"I wrote the demo of it five years earlier."
54:52;54:54;"I was still like writing for it."
54:54;54:55;"And we kind of just like, I remember being in a room,"
54:55;54:57;"like we just like played it as a band,"
54:57;54:59;"you know, just like live everything."
54:59;55:00;"Just remember feeling like really disheartened,"
55:00;55:03;"like, all right, forget it."
55:03;55:07;"But then this record being like the most studio based"
55:07;55:10;"started to feel like maybe it was worth a try again."
55:10;55:14;"I do remember there being a lot of naysayers"
55:14;55:17;"about the song in the orbit."
55:17;55:19;"I think because it was a quiet song."
55:19;55:21;"And I think like people would be listening back"
55:21;55:23;"to the recordings or be playing it for people."
55:23;55:25;"And people be like, sometimes feel like,"
55:25;55:26;"all right, another song."
55:26;55:29;"And also this one starts so mellow."
55:29;55:30;"So unless you're super dialed in,"
55:30;55:32;"you're like in the right mood,"
55:32;55:35;"it doesn't get to the big part until deep into the song."
55:35;55:36;"So I just kind of remember like,"
55:36;55:39;"this is a song I can remember the most."
55:39;55:41;"Nobody coming in like hot, just being like,"
55:41;55:42;"the song sucks."
55:42;55:44;"But I just remember like some very notable people"
55:44;55:46;"being kind of, ah, you sure about that one?"
55:46;55:49;"Remember like a significant number of people saying that"
55:49;55:51;"and kind of being like, I don't know."
55:51;55:54;"Like, cause we were trying to like figure out the balance."

56:24;56:25;"- It's our Matt."
56:25;56:26;"- It's a lot of people's favorite VW song."
56:26;56:27;"- DC's own Matt."
56:27;56:28;"This is your favorite vampire song, Matt?"
56:28;56:31;"Wow, he's giving me the thumbs up."
56:31;56:32;"- You may not know this, Jake."
56:32;56:36;"This is like a very significant fan favorite."
56:36;56:37;"- I didn't know that."
56:37;56:38;"That's awesome."
56:38;56:39;"- It's like..."
56:39;56:40;"- You guys play it, right?"
56:40;56:41;"- Oh yeah, we play it all the time."
56:41;56:45;"But it's like one of the most requested VW songs."
56:45;56:46;"It's like..."
56:47;56:48;"- This part is so sick."
56:48;56:49;"- Yeah."
56:49;56:51;"So I feel like because it takes a while to get to this,"
56:51;56:54;"maybe people, when they hear it for the first time"

58:02;58:03;"I even remember though,"
58:03;58:06;"even when we toured this album,"
58:06;58:07;"maybe I was in my head,"
58:07;58:08;"I still felt like the new material"
58:08;58:11;"wasn't going down amazingly."
58:11;58:14;"It was a good tour, but I don't know."
58:14;58:16;"Yeah, I remember sometimes we'd be playing Hannah Hunt"
58:16;58:19;"and we had a famous joke about,"
58:19;58:21;"we played a festival in Korea"
58:21;58:22;"and we played Hannah Hunt in the set,"
58:22;58:25;"kind of like a daytime slot at an indie festival."
58:25;58:28;"CT said that he would close his eyes during that song"
58:28;58:29;"'cause it's like a ballad."
58:29;58:30;"And he said when he opened his eyes,"
58:30;58:31;"half the crowd was gone."
58:31;58:34;"And at the time we'd watch--"
58:34;58:35;"- I'm gonna go get a beer."
58:35;58:37;"- Yeah, at the time we'd,"
58:37;58:38;"on the bus or something,"
58:38;58:42;"we'd watched the underrated magician comedy"
58:42;58:44;"called ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"""
58:44;58:46;"with Steve Buscemi and Jim Carrey."
58:46;58:48;"And who else was in that?"
58:48;58:49;"- Steve Carell."
58:49;58:50;"- Steve Carell."
58:50;58:53;"And there's a running joke in that movie"
58:53;58:55;"about that the ultimate trick a magician can do"
58:55;58:57;"is to make the audience disappear."
58:57;58:59;"It's this running gag."
58:59;59:01;"And I feel like at the end, Steve Carell finally does it."
59:01;59:03;"He makes the audience disappear."
59:03;59:04;"And I don't even know what happens,"
59:04;59:05;"but it's like they wake up"
59:05;59:06;"and they're in a different place."
59:06;59:07;"Like, ""He did it!"
59:07;59:09;"""He made the audience disappear!"""
59:09;59:10;"'Cause I think the joke is like,"
59:10;59:12;"""Anybody can make a cat disappear."
59:12;59:14;"""Anybody can make themselves disappear."
59:14;59:15;"""Can you make the audience disappear?"""
59:15;59:17;"So anyway, that was this joke."
59:17;59:20;"So that became some laughs we had about that"
59:20;59:22;"that we pulled a Burt Wonderstone"
59:22;59:24;"and at the festival in Korea,"
59:24;59:27;"CD opened his eyes and the crowd had disappeared."
59:27;59:29;"But yeah, that's always meant a lot to me"
59:29;59:32;"that that song resonated with people."
59:32;59:36;"""Everlasting Arms,"" as I said,"
59:36;59:38;"also, I love this song."
59:38;59:39;"- Yeah, this one's sick."

01:08:16;01:08:17;"this was before we were working on this record,"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"but we were working on Contra."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"I was very stressed out,"
01:08:21;01:08:25;"living in Orem Hill, Brooklyn,"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"going to meet Rostam at the studio."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"And I walked into Dunkin' Donuts"

01:08:31;01:08:32;"- Strong."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"- And I did think I had like, stressed out energy,"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"and there's kind of a long line,"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"I got in the back of the line, like."
01:08:36;01:08:38;"And out of nowhere,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"this older Rasta dude said to me,"
01:08:40;01:08:41;"in a Jamaican accent,"
01:08:41;01:08:42;"which I won't do,"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"you take your time, Young Lion."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"He just said that to me."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"People don't say stuff like that,"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"that often to me."
01:08:49;01:08:49;"I went to the studio,"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"told Rasta, this guy said it,"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"I was like, song lyrics or something."
01:08:52;01:08:54;"He sat down, started playing these chords,"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"sang it,"
01:08:55;01:08:56;"thought that sounded great."
01:08:56;01:09:00;"And then we probably put it away for a long time."
01:09:00;01:09:04;"And then started talking about it again with this album."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Rostam said, well, if that's on the album,"
01:09:05;01:09:06;"I'd like to sing it."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"And I said, you know what,"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"that makes a lot of sense."
01:09:08;01:09:09;"You should sing it."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Especially 'cause for me,"
01:09:10;01:09:11;"not only did he write it,"
01:09:11;01:09:12;"I had this feeling,"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"I was like, well,"
01:09:13;01:09:14;"when I think of these words"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"and what they meant to me,"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"I remember somebody saying it to me."
01:09:17;01:09:18;"There's something really cool about it"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"on the end of this album."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"He comes in singing it,"
01:09:22;01:09:25;"this kind of like stinger."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"And the truth is,"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"shout out to that Rasta dude."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"But this album does have a lot of like low key,"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"you know, bit of Jamaican imagery"
01:09:34;01:09:37;"'cause the title comes from a dance hall song."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"We talked about this on the show, right?"
01:09:39;01:09:42;"- Maybe, maybe five years ago."
01:09:42;01:09:43;"- Wait, what's the song called?"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"- Sorry, dude."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"- Wait, can you look up,"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"what's the song where the guy goes,"
01:09:46;01:09:46;"modern vampires in the city."
01:09:46;01:09:49;"- Jake just clocks in and clocks out of this."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"- No, I take this show,"

01:09:52;01:09:53;"I don't remember the episode."
01:09:53;01:09:54;"- I don't, and I do,"

01:09:55;01:09:56;"I don't remember it."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"- We've done almost 200 episodes of this show."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"What's the song where the lyrics are,"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"modern vampires of the city hunting blood?"
01:10:02;01:10:02;"- Have we done a--"
01:10:02;01:10:03;"- I don't believe you've ever said this."
01:10:03;01:10:06;"- A top to bottom listen of this album before?"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"- We did Father of the Bride."
01:10:08;01:10:08;"- No."
01:10:09;01:10:10;"- I don't remember ever doing like--"
01:10:10;01:10:11;"- We did a deep dive on Step,"
01:10:11;01:10:12;"'cause we did an episode talking about like samples"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"and stuff."

01:27:02;01:27:04;"Sonic Youth, or whatever, but for you,"

01:49:20;01:49:21;"- Right."
01:49:21;01:49:23;"- For the, at the Costco."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"And it's sort of like,"
01:49:25;01:49:27;"do you want the 48-pack of toilet paper?"
01:49:27;01:49:28;"Yes, I do."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"- We know something big changed."
01:49:30;01:49:31;"There was a big shift."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"This is my favorite part coming up,"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"when she does the melody slightly differently."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"♪ I saw the sign ♪"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"I would say this is one of the most sublime moments"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"of mid-90s pop music."
01:49:43;01:49:44;"- Here we go."
01:49:44;01:49:45;"♪ I saw the sign ♪"
01:49:45;01:49:46;"- Oh, love it."

01:49:55;01:49:57;"that is definitely something that"
01:49:57;01:49:58;"an American person would never write,"
01:49:58;01:49:59;"and yet it's so good."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes"
01:50:01;01:50:03;"and I am happy now living without you."
01:50:03;01:50:05;"I've left you, oh, oh, oh."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"(laughing)"
01:50:07;01:50:09;"Just also like using the past tense."
01:50:09;01:50:10;"It's so good."
01:50:10;01:50:11;"I've left you."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"So straightforward, so Euro,"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"and yet so perfect."
01:50:16;01:50:18;"So I guess whatever the sign was,"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"it led to the end of this relationship."

01:50:35;01:50:38;"in the relationship that she took as a sign."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"Like she knew it was over at that moment."
01:50:40;01:50:43;"- It could be God, it could be anything."
01:50:43;01:50:46;"- It could be the way he was like chewing the sandwich."
01:50:46;01:50:48;"It just drove her crazy."
01:50:48;01:50:49;"- Yeah, you know--"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"- And she just eventually got to the point"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"where you're like, I can't deal with this."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Like I'm out of here."
01:50:52;01:50:54;"- You know, it does remind me of the work"
01:50:54;01:50:57;"of a celebrated current day Swedish filmmaker,"
01:50:57;01:51:01;"Ruben Ostlund, also zeroing in on small moments."
01:51:01;01:51:03;"You know, his film ""Force Majeure"""
01:51:03;01:51:06;"is all about the way one small moment"
01:51:06;01:51:08;"changes everything for a relationship"
01:51:08;01:51:09;"and for a family."
01:51:09;01:51:12;"- Definitely, when the guy fleed from the avalanche"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"and then didn't cop to it, that was the sign."
01:51:15;01:51:16;"- She saw the sign."
01:51:16;01:51:17;"- It was over."
01:51:17;01:51:20;"- I also like songs too where, you know,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"maybe when I was a kid, I might've thought about this more."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"I was like, well, you keep talking about the sign."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"What is the sign?"
01:51:25;01:51:28;"It's like you tell me, what are the signs in your life"
01:51:28;01:51:29;"that opened up your eyes?"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"- What are the signs in your life?"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"- What are the signs in your life"
01:51:33;01:51:35;"that opened up in your eyes?"
01:51:35;01:51:39;"And also, I know this might not be their intention,"
01:51:39;01:51:42;"but I also like this idea,"
01:51:42;01:51:43;"they keep talking about the sign."
01:51:43;01:51:45;"In a way, it's a MacGuffin."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"- Right."
01:51:46;01:51:47;"- The briefcase in pulp fiction."
01:51:47;01:51:49;"But what's in it?"
01:51:49;01:51:50;"And it's like, man."
01:51:50;01:51:52;"- Is that what I think it is?"
01:51:52;01:51:53;"It's beautiful."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- It's beautiful."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"(laughing)"
01:51:55;01:51:58;"Sometimes, and some people are very anti-MacGuffin."
01:51:58;01:52:00;"You know what a MacGuffin is, Seinfeld?"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"- What is that again?"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"- Can you read the definition of MacGuffin"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"for the listeners?"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"- MacGuffin, an object, event, or character"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"in a film or story that serves to set up"
01:52:09;01:52:10;"and keep a plot in motion despite"
01:52:10;01:52:12;"usually lacking intrinsic importance."
01:52:12;01:52:15;"Oh, it's waiting for a good 'o."
01:52:15;01:52:17;"- And there's a--"
01:52:17;01:52:18;"- Waiting for a good 'o."
01:52:18;01:52:21;"- There's a very small-brained interpretation,"
01:52:21;01:52:24;"which I may have even shared at times in my life"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"where a MacGuffin would seem like cheating, right?"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"A tight storytelling."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"- Right."
01:52:29;01:52:30;"- Tight songwriting."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"You show us what's at the center of it."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"You tell us what the sign is."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Show us what's in the briefcase."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Otherwise, you're telling us that there's"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"this central mystery."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"You're not giving it to us in all,"
01:52:41;01:52:44;"you're using that to create forward momentum"
01:52:44;01:52:46;"and change in people's lives,"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"and you're not gonna tell us the central mystery,"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"and we're just gonna watch all these other things"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"happen because of it, and you're not gonna tell us"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"the central mystery of it?"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"You know what that sounds like to me?"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"Life."
01:52:57;01:52:58;"- Damn, dude."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"- Oh, you got a problem with just watching"
01:53:00;01:53:05;"a series of changing events with no final answer"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"for why any of it's happening"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"or why it exists in the first place?"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Well, welcome to reality."
01:53:11;01:53:14;"- Life is chaos and meaningless."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"- Whether or not you think it's meaningless,"
01:53:16;01:53:17;"there is a central mystery."
01:53:17;01:53:19;"Why is anything here?"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"What started all this?"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"You guys know?"
01:53:22;01:53:23;"- You asking me for a number crutch?"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"- Yeah, number crutch."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"- Meaning of life?"
01:53:25;01:53:27;"- No, what started it?"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"- Oh, the big bang."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"- Yeah, well, before that,"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"who started the big bang?"
01:53:31;01:53:34;"Are you so confident in the big bang?"
01:53:34;01:53:37;"Anyway."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"- Why is there anything, man?"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"- But also, I like in the song that you keep talking"
01:53:40;01:53:40;"about the sign, you start thinking,"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"well, yeah, what is the sign?"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"And then they say, no one's gonna drag you up"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"to get into the light where you belong."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"They might be talking to their ex-boyfriend,"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"but they're also kind of--"
01:53:48;01:53:49;"- No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"where you belong."
01:53:51;01:53:53;"- But they're also talking to you, the listener."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"We were saying, guys, can you please explain this to me?"
01:53:55;01:53:57;"No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light"
01:53:57;01:53:58;"where you belong."
01:53:58;01:54:00;"They're almost saying, shut up."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"You create your own meaning in life."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"You create your own sign."
01:54:03;01:54:06;"This song is written by Jonas Berggren."
01:54:06;01:54:08;"Jonas Berggren had his sign."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"You wanna know the sign?"
01:54:09;01:54:10;"Find the sign in your life."
01:54:10;01:54:13;"- Jonas Berggren, welcome to time crisis."
01:54:13;01:54:16;"- So first question is, what's the sign, man?"
01:54:16;01:54:17;"Come clean."
01:54:17;01:54:20;"Bro, come clean, what's the sign?"
01:54:20;01:54:21;"Okay, I haven't told"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"(laughing)"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"anybody in a while."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"- I like how they're not concealing their accents."
01:54:27;01:54:29;"I feel like sometimes you hear this Euro pop"
01:54:29;01:54:32;"and they're trying to sound American."
01:54:32;01:54:35;"And this, the accent really shines through."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"- No, they're proud Swedes."
01:54:36;01:54:40;"Actually, I vaguely remember reading on the darker side,"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"was somebody in the band a neo-Nazi?"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"- Oh dear. - That's not ringing a bell."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- Let me get a number crunch."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"- Oh no."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"- Asa Bass neo-Nazi, that's a cool Google."
01:54:49;01:54:53;"- Okay, well, apparently Ulf Erberg"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"did have alleged Nazi ties."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Alleged, allegedly. - Look at the picture"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"of him there."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"- What did Ulf do in the band?"
01:55:00;01:55:04;"- Ulf, he's a musician in the band."
01:55:04;01:55:05;"- Ulf's a musician?"
01:55:05;01:55:08;"- I'm not sure what his role was."
01:55:08;01:55:11;"Did they all have like equal--"
01:55:11;01:55:12;"- Very talented bass player,"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"made up my whole string bass."
01:55:14;01:55:16;"- Okay, maybe. - A musician under fire."
01:55:16;01:55:18;"- What was his alleged Nazi ties?"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Was it like when he was young,"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"he got mixed up with the wrong crowd kind of thing?"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"- A report surfaced claiming he was a member"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"of a pro-Nazi band before he helped form"
01:55:27;01:55:30;"the hit making Swedish pop group."
01:55:30;01:55:34;"Let's see, he said he admits he's regretful"
01:55:34;01:55:37;"about quote, ""Some of my thoughts from those days,"""
01:55:37;01:55:39;"which he calls nauseating, so he's distanced himself."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"Oh, he insists the band, in question,"
01:55:41;01:55:43;"the band's name is Commit Suicide,"
01:55:43;01:55:45;"is the name of the band. - What's the name of the band?"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"- Name of the band."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"He did not, he insists--"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"- Probably not on Apple Music."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"- Maybe not, yeah."
01:55:51;01:55:55;"He insists that he did not write the controversial songs"
01:55:55;01:55:58;"attributed to them, which popped up in a demo tape"
01:55:58;01:56:02;"that's been reportedly making the rounds for some time now."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"And Ulf, to your question,"
01:56:04;01:56:07;"oh, he's gone on to great success."
01:56:07;01:56:11;"He's a musician, businessman, television and film producer,"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"and it still doesn't say, he was a keyboardist,"
01:56:13;01:56:17;"songwriter, singer in the band, he did it all."
01:56:17;01:56:21;"- Ulf was, he was playing some keys in the band,"
01:56:22;01:56:24;"down in the practice room, here's this guy yelling,"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"going, ""What's he saying?"""
01:56:26;01:56:29;"Later on, the demo tape's floating around,"
01:56:29;01:56:31;"guys, I didn't write the lyrics, come on."
