00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back once again. On this week's episode, we talk to the social media strategists"
00:08;00:18;"of Texas-based Buffalo Wang's restaurant, Pluckers. We also talk about A Star is Born"
00:18;00:26;"and its potential sequel, Zzzz. All this, plus the greatest hits of 1983 and today."
00:26;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts. One."
00:33;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. The war I felt, robbing me of my rightful"
00:40;00:49;"chances. My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt to the blow, when"
00:49;01:12;"the bus had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us"
01:12;01:21;"is lying, leave an only way. Time Crisis, back again. So Jake, I still haven't seen"
01:21;01:30;"A Star is Born. Oh man! Clearly I gotta see it. Yeah. It's the music event of the year."
01:30;01:35;"And film. And film of the year. Why haven't you seen it? You been busy? Yeah, I've been"
01:35;01:39;"kinda busy. Yeah. It just never feels like the right night to like go to the movies."
01:39;01:43;"Interesting. I love going to the movies, so it's like if there's an excuse, I'm doing"
01:43;01:48;"it, we're doing it. I like it conceptually. We saw it opening weekend. Was the theater"
01:48;01:55;"packed? No. Really? Pasadena Arclight. Pretty full. Nice. I'm looking at the A Star is Born"
01:55;01:59;"merch. Some of it is kinda what you'd expect, 'cause for people who haven't seen the movie"
01:59;02:04;"like me, but really don't know anything about it, the two main characters are Allie, played"
02:04;02:09;"by Lady Gaga. I'm impressed that you know these character names. I've read so much about"
02:09;02:14;"it. I'm about as familiar with this movie as anybody could be without having seen it."
02:14;02:19;"Lady Gaga plays Allie, and Bradley Cooper plays Jackson Maine. The A Star is Born merch"
02:19;02:25;"is as if they were real people, so it's like a picture of Lady Gaga and it says like, ""Allie."""
02:25;02:29;"It's almost like you picked it up at an Allie concert. Right. And then there's some Jackson"
02:29;02:33;"Maine ones, but the one that's really hilarious to me is a picture of Bradley Cooper holding"
02:33;02:37;"a guitar and it says, ""One night only, Jackson Maine, Louisville, Kentucky with special guest"
02:37;02:42;"May 15th, 2009."" I'm like, ""Damn, that's a lot of detail."" Is that like a part of the"
02:42;02:47;"movie? Is there a special concert? I don't know. The 2009 is weird, 'cause it's sort"
02:47;02:52;"of like in the movie you are sort of wondering like, ""When is this taking place? Is this"
02:52;02:59;"2017, 2018?"" I guess this answers your question. It's 2009. Are there references to current"
02:59;03:04;"President Obama? No. I think it is set in the present day, but he's had a long career."
03:04;03:10;"Do people use cell phones in the film? Oh, yeah. The Nintendo Switch? Very heavy with"
03:10;03:14;"the Nintendo Switch. Okay, so then it's gotta be the past couple years. No, I think it is"
03:14;03:18;"the last few years, but yeah, he's had a long career and he's maybe on the backside of that"
03:18;03:25;"career. Maybe he was at his peak, first decade of the century. What happened to you, Jackson?"
03:25;03:29;"Sitting in your apartment all day playing Nintendo Switch? Used to be a big star. I"
03:29;03:33;"wish I could do the Jackson Mean voice. What is it? Is it Southern? It's real low. It's"
03:33;03:39;"just like a lot of fry. It's like, ""What am I been doing? I just been playing that Nintendo"
03:39;03:46;"Switch."" Better than Nintendo Wii. That was the main Nintendo platform a few years back."
03:46;03:51;"I'll tell you what. You know who his voice is kind of like? Yeah. It's Sam Elliott, 'cause"
03:51;03:55;"Sam Elliott is in the film. He plays his brother. Oh, wow. I didn't want to spoil that, 'cause"
03:55;03:59;"that's kind of a late reveal. Oh, is it? Well, midway through the film. I feel like every"
03:59;04:03;"article about this that I've seen references the brother, Sam Elliott. See, I hadn't read"
04:03;04:07;"that much about it, and I actually went in with low expectations, and I was- Blown away."
04:07;04:12;"Thrilled. Anyway- You know what it was? It reminded me of Titanic in a good way. It was"
04:12;04:20;"a sweeping, tragic romance epic. Whoa. I haven't heard anybody compare it to Titanic. That's"
04:20;04:24;"what I thought of when the credits started rolling. Usually when the credits start, the"
04:24;04:29;"crowd just kind of gets up immediately and dances out. In this situation, the crowd stayed"
04:29;04:35;"seated just to kind of soak up the last sort of ambience of the film. That's what popped"
04:35;04:40;"in, Titanic. It's like a different aesthetic than Titanic, but it's the same sort of emotional"
04:40;04:43;"register. I haven't seen the movie, but the main thing I just kept thinking about was"
04:43;04:48;"how hilarious it'd be to get you this shirt. Maybe Tom Cruise has got to get you this one."
04:48;04:52;"Did you rock this one? It's not just Jack- I couldn't rock it, dude. No, but I love that"
04:52;04:57;"it's so specific. Also, how did they decide this? Louisville, Kentucky with special guest"
04:57;05:03;"May 15th, 2009. Well, maybe he's from there? His character? Oh yeah, because there's a"
05:03;05:08;"scene when he's hanging out with Dave Chappelle, and I think that's back- Back in Louisville?"
05:08;05:13;"In like where he's from. Have you seen the film, Seinfeld? I saw it. Oh, really? Yeah."
05:13;05:19;"Lots? Yeah, I also had low expectations, and yeah, I enjoyed it. I don't think I enjoyed"
05:19;05:24;"it as much as you did, but I liked it. I just like this shirt because it's one step beyond."
05:24;05:28;"I guess there's like levels. You can get a shirt that's kind of like, ""I'm a fan of this"
05:28;05:32;"thing,"" and then you can get a shirt that's kind of like, ""I'm such a fan of this thing,"
05:32;05:38;"I want a shirt that kind of makes it seem like I live in the world of the movie."" Right."
05:38;05:42;"And this one is like, ""I'm so deep into the world of the movie that I'm actually exploring"
05:42;05:46;"like the outer reaches."" It's like fan fiction. I'm exploring the Jackson Maine universe,"
05:46;05:47;"the JMU."
05:47;06:00;"Maybe it's time to let the old ways die. Maybe it's time to let the old ways die. Takes a"
06:00;06:11;"lot to change a man. Hell, it takes a lot to try. Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."
06:11;06:24;"Nobody knows what a ways for the dead. Nobody knows what a ways for the dead. Some folks"
06:24;06:30;"just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read. Nobody knows what a"
06:30;06:32;"ways for the dead."
06:32;06:39;"Are there other examples of, from like realistic films of like fan fiction merch?"
06:39;06:42;"There's the Axe Capital Billions t-shirt."
06:42;06:43;"Nice."
06:43;06:44;"Comes to mind."
06:44;06:45;"Oh yeah, well exactly."
06:45;06:46;"But that's not like, they're not pushing it."
06:46;06:51;"It's like you could go to the NBC store at Rockefeller Center and you could get a shirt"
06:51;06:56;"of Michael Scott from The Office saying some like classic Michael Scott type line and just"
06:56;06:59;"wear that and people would be like, ""Oh, you like The Office?"" And then you could get a"
06:59;07:03;"shirt that says The Office. You get a shirt that says Dunder Mifflin."
07:03;07:04;"Okay."
07:04;07:05;"It's like a little inside."
07:05;07:10;"It's like semi plausibly realistic if that universe existed."
07:10;07:11;"Yeah, exactly."
07:11;07:13;"If The Office universe existed."
07:13;07:15;"They would have Dunder Mifflin t-shirts."
07:15;07:18;"You wouldn't have a t-shirt with Michael Scott on it."
07:18;07:22;"Exactly. As a fan of a fictional universe, the t-shirt you choose shows."
07:22;07:24;"That's to exist within that universe."
07:24;07:27;"It shows what reality you want to live in. There's people who are like, ""I enjoy The"
07:27;07:34;"Office. It's a funny program. I like to flip it on. Takes my cares away."" And there's other"
07:34;07:38;"people who are like, ""I live in The Office universe."""
07:38;07:41;"That's why Ghostbusters shirts always kind of worked."
07:41;07:43;"Because they're both at once."
07:43;07:48;"Yeah. It's the simple shirt with just the logo, but in the film, the Ghostbusters become"
07:48;07:54;"celebrities and are like a hot thing in New York for a second. And people are rocking"
07:54;07:58;"in the fictional universe of the film. People are wearing shirts with the Ghostbusters logo."
07:58;07:59;"Right."
08:00;08:04;"When you wear that, it's like you might've been a fan in the fictional universe of the"
08:04;08:11;"film. But a lot of movies, what could you do? Like in Lebowski, there probably is fictional"
08:11;08:12;"merch you could wear."
08:12;08:19;"Yeah. You get a Harry Potter shirt that says, ""Property of Gryffindor,"" as if you bought"
08:19;08:23;"it at the Gryffindor gift shop. Like it's a real place."
08:23;08:26;"Yeah. I don't know about this Jackson Maine tee."
08:26;08:29;"Anyway, we're going to get it for you. Where are you going to wear it to?"
08:29;08:34;"I wouldn't wear it. I'll be honest with you. I love free t-shirts."
08:34;08:39;"The Time Crisis crew drops $35 plus shipping and handling on this t-shirt. We get it for"
08:39;08:44;"you. It's a high quality shirt. Nice cotton. Feels good. Fits great."
08:44;08:45;"Very soft."
08:45;08:47;"Very soft. You're not going to wear it?"
08:47;08:50;"I would wear it to a taping of the show."
08:50;08:51;"That's it?"
08:51;08:52;"Yeah."
08:52;08:53;"You're wearing a Sweet Martha's Cookie Jar sweatshirt right now."
08:53;08:58;"I know. I have so much merch. Actually, I was saying this the other day. My wardrobe"
08:58;09:06;"right now is like, it's either like Time Crisis or Vampire Weekend or Little Wings or Richard"
09:06;09:07;"Pictures based."
09:07;09:08;"Or Sweet Martha's."
09:08;09:10;"Or Sweet Martha's. That's kind of like TC Universe."
09:10;09:11;"Yeah. True."
09:11;09:18;"Because I have three Sweet Martha's shirts. I have 8 Minute Cape Cod. That's a classic."
09:18;09:22;"I have my, I've been wearing my Father's Day Weekend, Vampire Weekend."
09:22;09:24;"Oh yeah. I've seen you wear that out in the wild."
09:24;09:25;"A lot."
09:25;09:26;"That looks great."
09:26;09:30;"It's kind of cooling down a little bit in LA. And I've got countless Little Wings and"
09:30;09:31;"Richard Pictures shirts."
09:31;09:35;"And all those shirts, you never think twice about throwing on?"
09:35;09:39;"No. They're cool, man. But like, just like walking into like,"
09:39;09:40;"I agree. I agree."
09:40;09:43;"They're like civil coffee down the street from me. I'm just like wearing like a Jackson"
09:43;09:48;"Maine tee. I mean, that does show that I do, I do."
09:48;09:49;"That's sick."
09:49;09:53;"I would describe myself as a guy that's super, you know, self-conscious about my appearance"
09:53;09:54;"in public."
09:54;09:55;"But you would be that self-conscious."
09:55;09:57;"That would, that's pushing it."
09:57;09:59;"Would you wear an Ally shirt?"
09:59;10:00;"No, man."
10:00;10:04;"Would you wear a shirt that says Bradley Cooper and it's a picture of Bradley Cooper directing"
10:04;10:05;"Stars Born?"
10:05;10:06;"Like, just-"
10:06;10:08;"Is that sure that you're more in touch with consensus reality?"
10:08;10:11;"I like that. I like that interpretation."
10:11;10:15;"Let's get one that's just like, picture Bradley Cooper says Bradley Cooper on the back. It"
10:15;10:16;"says director of Stars Born."
10:16;10:17;"That'd be solid."
10:17;10:18;"You'd rock that?"
10:18;10:21;"And it's him like in an editing booth or something."
10:21;10:24;"Or no, if it was, yeah, that's fine."
10:24;10:27;"Or maybe that's the back of the shirt and then the front of the shirt is, is him as"
10:27;10:28;"Jackson Maine."
10:28;10:29;"You know what would be really dope?"
10:29;10:34;"Like take it deep, like find a picture of like a young Bradley Cooper from like when"
10:34;10:39;"he was like 18 and like the mid nineties and then just like have like, make a shirt from"
10:39;10:45;"like Jackson Maine live at the Troubadour, July 22nd, 1996."
10:45;10:47;"Like really go deep."
10:47;10:52;"And it's like a very young Bradley Cooper, like, you know, like in the role of a very"
10:52;10:53;"young Jackson Maine."
10:53;10:54;"Opening-"
10:54;10:56;"Because he's had a 25 year career."
10:56;10:57;"Yeah."
10:57;10:58;"Opening-"
10:58;11:02;"Opening for Eddie Vedder, for Eddie Vedder solo ukulele show at the Troubadour, 1998."
11:02;11:10;"Oh no, that's even deeper. You make an Eddie Vedder t-shirt solo to her and then very small"
11:10;11:14;"text at the bottom is just with special guest Jackson Maine."
11:14;11:19;"You notice you make it Austin city limits, 2005 festival shirt, just with like whatever"
11:19;11:20;"it is on the front."
11:20;11:24;"And then in the back, just very subtly you change it to Jackson Maine."
11:24;11:29;"Like, like 35th listed performer."
11:29;11:35;"You know, it's all just spot on realistic taking the Jackson Maine, just a granular level"
11:35;11:36;"of detail."
11:36;11:37;"Okay."
11:37;11:38;"What about this is probably the coolest Jackson Maine shirt."
11:38;11:41;"This one, the one I'm showing Jake now, it kind of looks like an actual vintage, like"
11:41;11:43;"Bob Seger shirt from the seventies."
11:43;11:45;"Would you rock this one?"
11:45;11:46;"Oh man."
11:46;11:50;"I mean, you love the film."
11:50;11:55;"It's the best looking shirt of the ones we've seen, but you know, what's funny, I couldn't"
11:55;11:59;"rock it because, well, it's still from the film, but also because of the time period"
11:59;12:05;"in which the film is set, it automatically becomes, this is like a reissue, a fake retro"
12:05;12:08;"shirt that you'd see at like target."
12:08;12:09;"You didn't buy this."
12:09;12:11;"Jackson Maine wasn't touring in 1980."
12:11;12:18;"You know, there's a whole like other uncanny valley."
12:18;12:42;"I'm a man."
12:42;13:01;"Do you think that they're going to continue making albums as Jackson Maine?"
13:01;13:03;"Like, is this to keep going?"
13:03;13:07;"I think Bradley Cooper is to, uh, he would find that corny."
13:07;13:08;"That's my guess."
13:08;13:10;"And he's right to find that corny."
13:10;13:12;"Keep expanding the stars born universe."
13:12;13:13;"Sequel."
13:13;13:18;"I could totally picture like somebody right now putting together a deal."
13:18;13:22;"Bradley Cooper, lady Gaga tour tour."
13:22;13:23;"Oh yeah."
13:23;13:26;"Arena tour as Jackson Maine and Allie."
13:26;13:27;"Wow."
13:27;13:28;"Would people go?"
13:28;13:29;"I mean, Gaga's huge."
13:29;13:32;"So Gaga's got a built in thing and they'd have to do it soon."
13:32;13:38;"Who are some other fictional musicians they could get in Jeff Bridges from crazy heart."
13:38;13:39;"Real mellow."
13:39;13:40;"We've got Jackson Maine."
13:40;13:41;"We've got special guests."
13:41;13:43;"Jeff Bridges from crazy heart."
13:43;13:48;"Mark Wahlberg from rockstar."
13:48;13:50;"What other fictional musicians?"
13:50;13:51;"That's a good one."
13:51;13:52;"Blues brothers."
13:52;13:53;"That's a good one."
13:53;13:54;"What?"
13:54;13:55;"John Goodman."
13:55;13:56;"Yeah."
13:56;13:57;"And Dan Aykroyd."
13:57;13:59;"The John Goodman reboot."
13:59;14:06;"Jackson Maine with miles Teller from whiplash on drums."
14:06;14:09;"Whiplash long sleeve."
14:09;14:10;"Weird movie merch."
14:10;14:11;"I love it."
14:11;14:12;"Oh, you know what?"
14:12;14:13;"I wear long dumb road shirts."
14:13;14:15;"Oh, there you go."
14:15;14:17;"Coming out next month, folks."
14:17;14:18;"Oh wow."
14:18;14:19;"Real soon."
14:19;14:20;"Yeah."
14:20;14:21;"Looking forward to that."
14:21;14:22;"Oh yeah."
14:22;14:23;"Trying to think of movie shirts."
14:23;14:26;"I mean, I just remember like in the nineties when I was very interested in t-shirts when"
14:26;14:31;"I was like 12, 13, there were just like very interested in t-shirts."
14:31;14:37;"No, it's like a joke in my family that my main passions as a young adult, I don't remember"
14:37;14:41;"exactly the order, but at some point I was really into comic books, specifically X-Men"
14:41;14:42;"comic books."
14:42;14:45;"I've probably talked about this on the show."
14:45;14:49;"And then at some point before I got just like deeply into music and I was liked music, but"
14:49;14:55;"before I was like, you know, would spend my allowance on CDs."
14:55;14:59;"There was some point in between where my thing was like t-shirts, just like a t-shirt guy."
14:59;15:01;"And now I kind of am again."
15:01;15:02;"Yeah."
15:02;15:03;"It seems like that never went away."
15:03;15:06;"I mean, there was a period, you know, like early vampire weekend days."
15:06;15:08;"My whole thing was like, I'm not into t-shirts, polos."
15:08;15:10;"I'm into collared shirts and polos."
15:10;15:14;"What were your big, like coveted t-shirts when you were a kid?"
15:14;15:18;"It was at that point, it was also kind of like very early internet days."
15:18;15:21;"So you would still get mail order catalogs."
15:21;15:24;"So it could be like really exciting to just like see all the options."
15:24;15:26;"So actually I was into music shirts."
15:26;15:30;"One prize position I had, which I'm pretty sure I don't have, cause I was looking for"
15:30;15:34;"once is the Southern California and Scott punk band voodoo glow skulls."
15:34;15:36;"I had like a sick voodoo glow skull shirt."
15:36;15:37;"I had a lot of Scott t-shirts."
15:37;15:38;"Were you a fan of the band?"
15:38;15:39;"Yeah."
15:39;15:41;"I love voodoo glow skulls."
15:41;15:43;"And they had like specifically sick merch."
15:43;15:44;"Yeah."
15:44;15:45;"They had cool merch."
15:45;15:47;"It was like skeletons being the horn section."
15:47;15:48;"Yes."
15:48;15:49;"I had some music shirts."
15:49;15:53;"I had a, uh, Ultraman, Japanese superhero ringer tee."
15:53;15:56;"Remember ringer tees were very hot in the nineties."
15:56;15:57;"Oh, with the cuffs."
15:57;15:58;"Yeah."
16:00;16:01;"I never, I never could wear those."
16:01;16:02;"Really?"
16:02;16:03;"I just felt too goofy."
16:03;16:04;"I just felt like too hip or something."
16:04;16:06;"I just never could rock that."
16:06;16:07;"I could see that."
16:07;16:08;"Yeah."
16:08;16:12;"If I was like college age, when I was like 12, yeah, it was kind of like a seventies"
16:12;16:13;"throwback."
16:13;16:14;"Right."
16:14;16:15;"Yeah."
16:15;16:19;"Another one I had, which is like classic nineties ironic style was a Mr. Bubbles shirt."
16:19;16:23;"You know, just kind of like a funny goofy old brand."
16:23;16:26;"Dude, I had a Mento shirt in high school."
16:26;16:31;"We, um, me and some buddies, we like saved up all of the Mentos wrappers."
16:31;16:34;"If you sent in like 10 or 15, they sent you a shirt."
16:34;16:35;"Oh really?"
