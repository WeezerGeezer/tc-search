00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis back again with an action-packed episode. On this week's TC,"
00:06;00:12;"Jake and I discuss Neo Yokio Pink Christmas, the ConAgra food universe. We"
00:12;00:17;"also talked to Vic Berger about his new album, plus the creator of the Joker Man"
00:17;00:25;"font, Andrew Smith. All this plus the greatest hits of 2018 and 1995. This is"
00:25;00:31;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:16;01:22;"Time Crisis back again. So Jake, we were just talking, we got a plan the"
01:22;01:27;"TC Christmas party. Right, we did one last year. Awkwardly formal Italian"
01:27;01:31;"restaurant. I remember getting there kind of early. I sat at the bar, bought"
01:31;01:36;"like a $12 whiskey. It ended up just being a four-man dinner at an Italian"
01:36;01:41;"restaurant. Yeah. Because not even all the producers could come. So it was you,"
01:41;01:46;"me, Seinfeld 2000, and Nick just sitting at this awkwardly formal dinner. Very"
01:46;01:51;"formal dinner. Bitcoin was in its prime. We talked about cryptocurrency. Right. I"
01:51;01:56;"still have Coinbase on my phone. And me too. How often do you check in? Not that"
01:56;02:01;"often. The meager amount of money I put into it is now close to worthless. I did"
02:01;02:06;"have friends though that bought in like maybe summer of 2017. Yeah, and did they"
02:06;02:11;"sell at the right time? One did. One held on too long? One friend made a few"
02:11;02:15;"thousand dollars. That's decent. Don't you think it's gonna come back in like a"
02:15;02:19;"decade? Like we'll forget all about it and then it's gonna be like, yeah, oh my"
02:19;02:25;"god. I'm not gonna sell now. No. You don't buy high and sell low. I'm into that."
02:25;02:28;"You're getting other people money. It's very altruistic to buy high, sell low."
02:28;02:32;"What's the investing thing that people, I feel like investing guys always tell me"
02:32;02:36;"this. How often are you talking to investing guys? Not in a while. I remember at"
02:36;02:38;"some point, I mean I don't know if I've said this on the show, I always thought"
02:38;02:42;"that I'd be more interested in money. I think when I was a little kid, you know, I"
02:42;02:45;"said I wanted to be like a musician or an astronaut. And I remember kind of like"
02:45;02:49;"around middle school, probably rubbed off on me from some other kids. Like just"
02:49;02:51;"hearing from other kids at school. Being like, what do you want to be when you"
02:51;02:54;"grow up? And then just kind of seeing like a certain type of like cool kid in"
02:54;02:58;"my suburban town. Being like, I want to be a businessman. And I kind of remember that"
02:58;03:01;"like rubbing off on me. Like, oh sh*t, do I want to be a businessman too? Yep. There's"
03:01;03:04;"always like in the back of my head, I was like, you know, I've always gravitated"
03:04;03:07;"towards the arts, but like I always liked math. So I was kind of like, you know, one"
03:07;03:11;"day I bet I'll be pretty interested in like managing my finances, things of that"
03:11;03:15;"nature. Turns out not at all. This could be revisionist history, but I remember when I"
03:15;03:20;"met you, 2005, maybe you just finished your sophomore or junior year of college."
03:20;03:24;"Yeah. And we were on that tour, which has been referenced. The Dirty Projectors Tour."
03:24;03:29;"A few times on the show. Yeah. You know, and I was like 27 or something. Yeah. And I was"
03:29;03:33;"like doing not much. But I was like, Ezra, what's your vibe after school, man? Like"
03:33;03:36;"what are you gonna do? Like, what are you thinking about? What did I say? Law school?"
03:36;03:42;"Maybe I'm making this up. No, no. I was like maybe Wall Street. Is that crazy? There was"
03:42;03:48;"a lot of things getting bandied about. I did also apply to, for the CIA. Are you serious?"
03:48;03:52;"Yeah. But just on their website, somehow this like rumor got out of control. And like I"
03:52;03:55;"saw somebody else being like, you know, the CIA tried to recruit Ezra. But the truth is"
03:55;03:59;"I vaguely remember just like being a senior and being like, what should I do? See, I"
03:59;04:04;"remember this. I was like, huh, maybe it'd be cool to live abroad. I don't know. Maybe"
04:04;04:07;"I was just like looking at some dumb college website. It's like apply to the CIA. And at"
04:07;04:10;"the time I didn't even think about like the ethical implications or anything. I was just"
04:10;04:14;"kind of like, all right, let me check it out. I just remember they had like an online forum."
04:14;04:19;"You know, they're just like college major, English, languages spoken, one English. And"
04:19;04:23;"I was kind of like, yeah, they're not going to hit me back. But I don't know. It's not"
04:23;04:29;"like I was particularly interested in like espionage or, you know, regime change. I was"
04:29;04:30;"like, that'd be cool."
04:30;04:31;"Furthering American interest abroad."
04:31;04:35;"Yeah. I'm sure I would have hated that. I was just kind of like, might be cool to, you"
04:35;04:36;"know, live somewhere else."
04:36;04:37;"Ice age heat wave can't complain if the world's at large. Why should I remain? Walked away"
04:37;04:38;"to another planet. Gonna find another place maybe one I can stand. I move on to another"
04:38;04:39;"day. Do a whole new town. I'm gonna find another place maybe one I can stand. I move"
04:39;04:40;"on to another day. Do a whole new town. I'm gonna find another place maybe one I can"
04:40;04:41;"stand. I move on to another day. Do a whole new town. I'm gonna find another place maybe"
04:41;04:42;"one I can stand. I move on to another day. Do a whole new town. I'm gonna find another"
04:42;04:55;"place maybe one I can stand. I move on to another day. Do a whole new town. Went to"
04:55;05:01;"the porch to have a thought. Got to the door and again I couldn't stop. You don't know"
05:01;05:08;"where and you don't know when. But you still got your words and you got your friends. Walking"
05:08;05:15;"on to another day. Work a little harder, work another way. Well, uh-uh, baby, I ain't got"
05:15;05:22;"no plan. I float alone, maybe would you understand? Gonna float alone, maybe would you understand?"
05:22;05:26;"Well, I float alone, maybe would you understand?"
05:26;05:33;"Anyway, the thing that investment people say is be fearful when others are greedy and greedy"
05:33;05:34;"when others are fearful."
05:34;05:41;"Oh, wow. So Seinfeld and I got burned on the crypto craze of late 2017 because--"
05:41;05:42;"'Cause you guys were greedy."
05:42;05:43;"We were greedy."
05:43;05:44;"Yeah."
05:44;05:45;"When you should have been fearful."
05:45;05:47;"And I kept diversifying and that was no good."
05:47;05:48;"You got Ripple."
05:48;05:49;"Ethereum."
05:49;05:50;"You got Litecoin."
05:50;05:53;"I thought, let me spread this out. Let me, you know, bet on a few horses."
05:53;05:54;"So now--"
05:54;05:55;"It's all worthless."
05:55;05:59;"So now, well, of course, yeah, it's one thing when you're talking about like the S&P 500,"
05:59;06:05;"which at least has held value for a long time. Crypto is a little shakier, who knows? But"
06:05;06:10;"now crypto is down in the toilet. All these guys like Seinfeld who invested their life"
06:10;06:13;"savings in it, he's freaking out right now. He's fearful."
06:13;06:15;"I put everything into that crypto."
06:15;06:20;"But you know what? According to the finance bros, now's the time to get greedy, actually."
06:20;06:24;"Because we come in and we see the Seinfelds of the world who took all the money he made"
06:24;06:30;"from doing social media and he put it right into crypto. And now he's freaking out. He's"
06:30;06:35;"like, OK, I'll take pennies on the dollar for my Ethereum. And then a greedy guy comes"
06:35;06:39;"in and says, here's a few pennies. And then you take your pennies and you go buy back"
06:39;06:42;"some followers on Twitter or whatever you do."
06:42;06:47;"Yeah. Looking back at that crypto craze of late 2017, I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't"
06:47;06:53;"go crazy on it. I put a little bit of money in because I just like I really just got taken"
06:53;06:54;"for a ride."
06:54;06:59;"I picture Jake at our last Christmas party, drunk off his ass, just down in twenty seven"
06:59;07:05;"dollar fancy vodka martinis. And we're like, Jake, man, that's not really expensive stuff,"
07:05;07:10;"man. You're like, I want the veal. I want the eighty dollar steak. And we're like, well,"
07:10;07:16;"you don't eat veal. And you're like, guys, I'm in crypto. But this time next year, I'll"
07:16;07:20;"buy this whole restaurant. And we're like, OK, Jake, I know it's up right now, but come"
07:20;07:21;"on, man."
07:21;07:26;"You were wearing a full Versace sweatsuit. It was very out of character. You were like"
07:26;07:29;"putting sauce on it. You're like, I don't care. I got three more of these. It was a"
07:29;07:30;"weird time in my life."
07:30;07:34;"I remember we were like, Jake, you want to go see Dead & Co. next year? And you were"
07:34;07:39;"like, I can't be on a PGA to Vegas to see Chainsmokers. And we're like, damn, you've"
07:39;07:42;"changed, man. Anyway, that like changes in a year."
07:42;07:45;"Well, the crypto crash brought me back down to earth."
07:45;07:49;"You kept telling us I'm going to crypto Jake at that point. Right. Right. You said, call"
07:49;07:51;"me crypto Jake."
07:51;07:54;"This was like a weird 10 day period in my life."
07:54;07:55;"I was there."
07:55;07:57;"I'm ashamed to relive this."
07:57;07:58;"You were the crypto wolf of Wall Street."
07:58;08:02;"I have a mansion, forget the price."
08:02;08:07;"Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice."
08:07;08:12;"I live in hotels, tear out the walls."
08:12;08:17;"I have accountants, pay for it all."
08:17;08:22;"They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time."
08:22;08:32;"I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime."
08:32;08:37;"Life's been good to me so far."
08:37;08:40;"We got to talk a little bit about Neo Yokio."
08:40;08:44;"It'll be out this Friday on Netflix, but we just had a screening."
08:44;08:45;"Saw it last night."
08:45;08:48;"Which you guys are at. Did you catch there's a crypto reference?"
08:48;08:50;"Remind me? I think I missed it."
08:50;08:54;"The sales clerk comes to Kaz's apartment, gives him the watch, and then he says, Charles"
08:54;08:55;"will pay you."
08:55;08:58;"And then Charles, aka Jude Law says, Ethereum or Ripple?"
08:58;09:00;"And he says, cashier's check will suffice."
09:00;09:02;"I like that you guys didn't go Bitcoin."
09:02;09:03;"You went a little deeper."
09:03;09:04;"Yeah."
09:04;09:07;"I think the original line was, which form of cryptocurrency would you prefer?"
09:07;09:09;"And we were like, it's a little on the nose."
09:09;09:10;"We're just like, this one's for the heads."
09:10;09:11;"So we just edited it down."
09:11;09:14;"So he just goes, Ethereum or Ripple?"
09:14;09:16;"Like coin or?"
09:16;09:19;"Ethereum or Ripple are the coolest ones anyway."
09:19;09:21;"Because it doesn't have coin in it."
09:21;09:22;"Right."
09:22;09:25;"Okay, we should talk more about Neo Yokio."
09:25;09:27;"Thanks for coming to the Friends and Family screening."
09:27;09:29;"Saw the Christmas special last night."
09:29;09:31;"It's called Neo Yokio Pink Christmas."
09:31;09:32;"Hilarious."
09:32;09:33;"It's a feature film. Thank you."
09:33;09:37;"I wonder if people will get the sense of humor more now."
09:37;09:39;"I mean, I felt like we doubled down a little bit."
09:39;09:41;"I think it was funnier."
09:41;09:43;"Yeah, this one might have been more straightforwardly funny."
09:43;09:44;"Than my memory of the first season."
09:44;09:47;"This was like, just straight up funnier."
09:47;09:48;"Yeah, I could see that."
09:48;09:49;"It was very satirical."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:50;09:54;"See, I think we always thought of Neo Yokio as being obviously satirical."
09:54;09:58;"But we also thought a lot of the humor came from like the awkwardness."
09:58;10:03;"And this one maybe perhaps has more just straightforward jokes and obvious satire."
10:03;10:04;"Yes."
10:04;10:11;"And the satire in terms of the subject matter of the satire was not that far from the TC universe."
10:11;10:13;"Maybe this one is a little more TC influenced."
10:13;10:15;"I mean, a lot of corporate retail stuff."
10:15;10:16;"That's true."
10:16;10:17;"I didn't even think about that."
10:17;10:24;"Actually, we need somebody now to make yet another Venn diagram that's Vampire Weekend, Time Crisis, and Neo Yokio."
10:24;10:30;"I mean, even just the opening shots of the Christmas special, like all high-end corporate retail."
10:30;10:31;"Right."
10:31;10:33;"And I was like, ""Wow, okay."""
10:33;10:36;"I was waiting for maybe one shot of just like Quiznos."
10:36;10:41;"The closest we got later was the people you'll see when you watch it."
10:41;10:47;"But there is a brief reference to the famous Domino's Pizza Rolex, which we were talking after the screening, is real."
10:47;10:48;"Right. I didn't know that."
10:48;10:51;"And generally speaking, Neo Yokio, a lot of this is real."
10:51;10:56;"Like some don't even have to satirize because it just is funny."
10:56;11:00;"And then, yeah, the whole subplot with the Capri branding."
11:00;11:01;"Oh, the Caprese."
11:01;11:02;"Yeah."
11:02;11:03;"Sorry, Caprese."
11:03;11:06;"Reminded me of the TC merch craze."
11:06;11:07;"Oh, yeah."
11:07;11:09;"That's very like some TC test kitchen."
11:09;11:10;"Yeah."
11:10;11:11;"Ted, [beep]"
11:11;11:12;"Yeah, that was a great story."
11:12;11:16;"They're talking about the Lexine Gottlieb played by Desus and Mero."
11:16;11:20;"They're supporting characters in Neo Yokio, but I think they always steal the show."
11:20;11:22;"Even when they have kind of like the C plot."
11:22;11:23;"Oh, yeah."
11:23;11:24;"It always like is kind of my favorite."
11:24;11:31;"I would say in terms of the Christmas specials that I've seen, this had the highest sum of curse words."
11:31;11:37;"We didn't think about it that much because there's never been like a ton of cursing in the NYU, which is the Neo Yokio universe."
11:37;11:38;"A lot of F-bombs."
11:38;11:39;"Yeah, there were kind of a lot."
11:39;11:42;"When we finally watched the whole thing down, we're like, ""Oh, damn."""
11:42;11:45;"There's a lot of just like, ""What the [beep]?"""
11:45;11:46;"Yeah."
11:46;11:50;"When I was watching, I was like in the second row, and then a friend of ours had brought his nine-year-old daughter."
11:50;11:51;"Oh, yeah."
11:51;11:54;"And she was on like a bean bag on the floor in front."
11:54;11:56;"The screening went down at Netflix headquarters, by the way."
11:56;11:57;"HQ on Sunset."
11:57;11:58;"Yeah."
11:58;11:59;"Very snazzy."
11:59;12:06;"And the first time that you guys dropped like an egregious F-bomb, I remember her like kind of scandalized looking back at her dad."
12:06;12:09;"And then her dad obviously paid it no mind."
12:09;12:13;"And it was just, maybe just like kind of gave her like a, ""Uh-huh, yeah, there's some cursing."""
12:13;12:18;"And then like by the time there was like the 15th F-bomb, she was just like coasting with it."
12:18;12:23;"Cursing is very scandalous when you're a kid because at school, that's like this obsession."
12:23;12:24;"Right."
12:24;12:29;"But the cursing in the Christmas special is not aggressive or crass."
12:29;12:33;"Is it too much of a spoiler to say there's a little bit of new music?"
12:33;12:42;"We'll play it on the next show, but there is-- it's definitely not Vampire Weekend, but there's one and a half original songs in this."
12:42;12:47;"Shout out to Blood Pop, Jaden, and Makonnen who are all involved in it."
12:47;12:50;"Damn, too bad Neo-Yokio Pink Christmas didn't have a theatrical release."
12:50;12:55;"Otherwise, maybe we could be in Oscar contenders along with Shallow."
12:55;12:57;"Toe to toe with B-Coop."
12:57;12:58;"Yeah."
12:58;13:00;"Does anyone call him B-Coop?"
13:00;13:01;"Yeah, probably."
13:01;13:02;"Or maybe just Coop."
13:02;13:05;"Anyway, everybody check out Neo-Yokio Pink Christmas."
13:05;13:06;"It's basically a feature film."
13:06;13:13;"It's 65 minutes long, which is not a common length for a feature film, but I think we're pioneering something or bringing it back."
13:13;13:14;"That's a good length for a movie."
13:14;13:16;"You can see that on Netflix, the streaming service?"
13:16;13:19;"Oh yeah, you can see it on Netflix, the streaming service."

14:46;14:48;"we kind of put it out to the TC heads."
14:48;14:50;"We posed the question,"
14:50;14:53;"what do you call the main universe that we live in?"
14:53;14:55;"You know, we said like,"

14:59;15:00;"when you're watching it,"
15:00;15:01;"and then you leave the theater and you're back in"
15:01;15:04;"what some people used to call real life,"
15:04;15:06;"although it's problematic to call that real life"
15:06;15:08;"because some people live on the internet now."
15:08;15:10;"I saw somebody say something about the PU,"
15:10;15:12;"the primary universe,"
15:12;15:14;"which is maybe a Donnie Darko reference or something."
15:14;15:17;"- Yeah, that's from Lindsey on Twitter."
15:17;15:20;"She said, ""Per the silverback millennial classic,"
15:20;15:22;"Donnie Darko,"
15:22;15:25;"call the PU primary universe in brackets."""
15:25;15:27;"- Okay, I'm into that."
15:27;15:29;"I don't like saying PU, but I like primary universe."
15:29;15:30;"There was one good one I saw."
15:30;15:32;"I'm sorry, I don't remember who wrote it,"
15:32;15:34;"but this guy actually suggested that"
15:34;15:36;"since Time Crisis is not fiction,"
15:36;15:38;"Marvel is fake."
15:38;15:39;"- TC is real."
15:39;15:40;"- And TC is real."
15:40;15:43;"That theoretically, we could just call"
15:43;15:44;"the real world the TCU."
15:44;15:47;"The Time Crisis universe is not just the show."
15:47;15:51;"The Time Crisis universe also includes the universe"
15:51;15:52;"that Time Crisis is a part of."
15:52;15:54;"And arguably, Time Crisis makes sense"
15:54;15:56;"to be the umbrella universe"
15:56;16:00;"because on Time Crisis, we talk about all this other stuff."
16:00;16:01;"- Reality."
16:01;16:02;"- Right."
16:02;16:06;"So arguably, when you go see Avengers Age of Ultron,"
16:06;16:09;"you're in the MCU, and then you step out of the theater,"
16:09;16:11;"you're back in the Time Crisis universe."
16:11;16:12;"That was one suggestion."
16:12;16:13;"- What about the STU?"
16:13;16:14;"- What's that?"
16:14;16:15;"- STU."
16:15;16:15;"- What's that?"
16:15;16:16;"- Straight up universe."
16:16;16:17;"(laughing)"
16:17;16:21;"- But what I did was just took the ST out of straight up."
16:21;16:22;"- I like that."
16:22;16:24;"It's an unusual acronym"
16:24;16:26;"because you're taking two letters from one word."
16:26;16:27;"- Yeah."
16:27;16:31;"You could do STUU, straight up universe, stew."
16:31;16:32;"- I like that, the stew."
16:32;16:34;"- I didn't even think you were going for an acronym."
16:34;16:36;"I thought you were just comparing life to a stew."
16:36;16:37;"- Yeah, it is."
16:37;16:38;"- You're getting a little bit metaphorical."
16:38;16:39;"- Oh yeah, that's kind of cool too."
16:39;16:40;"- Yeah, you're just in the stew."
16:40;16:42;"- You're just in the stew."
16:42;16:44;"- Oh, put like an umlaut over one of the U's."
16:44;16:45;"- Like Stussy?"
16:45;16:47;"(laughing)"
16:47;16:49;"- Husker do, Husker stew."
16:49;16:51;"- Okay, man, we live in the stew."
16:51;16:53;"The TCU is a part of the stew."

17:52;17:56;"- Now that it's become kind of trendy to have universes,"
17:56;17:58;"everybody wants a universe."
17:58;18:02;"So what used to be considered a portfolio of bull (beep)"
18:02;18:04;"is now getting rebranded as a universe."
18:04;18:07;"So, you know, everybody, Disney always,"
18:07;18:08;"we kind of grew up with Disney as a universe"
18:08;18:10;"and there'd be like a Hanna-Barbera,"
18:10;18:12;"something like a little bit lower down the totem pole."
18:12;18:13;"And you kind of be like, what is Hanna-Barbera?"
18:13;18:15;"It's just like (beep) you're Disney."
18:15;18:17;"And then be like, well, hold your horses actually."
18:17;18:18;"It's a universe."
18:18;18:21;"It's the HBU, the Hanna-Barbera universe."
18:21;18:22;"Everybody, and as soon as you confer"
18:22;18:24;"universe status on something,"
18:24;18:28;"suddenly these random things in the portfolio,"
18:28;18:30;"they take on some gravitas."
18:30;18:32;"- Don't disregard the Motley Crue universe."
18:32;18:34;"- Yeah, exactly."
18:34;18:36;"Or like, remember when we talked"
18:36;18:39;"to the chief marketing officer of Frito-Lay"
18:39;18:42;"and she would refer a lot to the Frito-Lay portfolio"
18:42;18:44;"of products, I wouldn't be surprised if over there now"
18:44;18:46;"they're talking about it more of the universe of products"
18:46;18:49;"because why should only Marvel get to have a universe?"
18:49;18:51;"Why can't you call it the Frito-Lay universe?"
18:51;18:53;"- Or the Pluckers universe."
18:53;18:54;"- Or the Pluckers universe."
18:54;18:56;"And if Frito-Lay isn't gonna start thinking"
18:56;18:58;"about their portfolio of products as a universe,"
18:58;19:02;"they better start because it's not just for fiction anymore."
19:02;19:03;"It's not just for movie studios."
19:03;19:06;"And I'll tell you why, because General Mills,"
19:06;19:07;"you know General Mills?"
19:07;19:08;"- I'm familiar."
19:08;19:09;"- You heard of them?"
19:09;19:11;"General Mills, who we mostly know"
19:11;19:13;"as a really massive American cereal company,"
19:13;19:15;"they're building their own cinematic universe."
19:15;19:16;"- Cinematic?"
19:16;19:17;"- Oh yeah."
19:18;19:20;"- Not retail universe?"
19:20;19:22;"- No, they're building a cinematic universe."
19:22;19:23;"- Okay."
19:23;19:25;"- And it's partially because there've always been"
19:25;19:27;"these kind of one-dimensional characters"
19:27;19:31;"who are helped to brand food items."
19:31;19:33;"And General Mills, we're talking about,"
19:33;19:34;"they have all these monsters."
19:34;19:37;"We got Count Chocula is very famous,"
19:37;19:41;"Frankenberry, Fruity Yummy Mummy, Boo Berry,"
19:41;19:44;"and apparently there was somebody called Fruit Brute."
19:44;19:46;"- So Count Chocula the feature film?"
19:46;19:49;"- Basically, I think probably a smart,"
19:49;19:51;"young college graduate over there was like,"
19:51;19:55;"man, our cereals aren't as poppin' as Cheerios"
19:55;19:58;"or something, like, we got these corny old cereals"
19:58;19:59;"that are kind of these fake monsters."
19:59;20:01;"And so we go, well hold on a second."
20:01;20:03;"That sounds like quite an asset."
20:03;20:05;"We're so much more than a portfolio of cereals."
20:05;20:07;"We're a cinematic universe."
20:07;20:10;"Somebody had that light bulb go off."
20:10;20:15;"- Wow, this, real quick, this is reminding me of,"
20:15;20:17;"what year did Wikipedia start, you think?"
20:17;20:20;"- Early, late '90s, early 2000s."
20:20;20:23;"- Okay, 'cause I remember my friend Jason Anderson,"
20:23;20:25;"and maybe my friend Steve Schrader,"
20:25;20:29;"who's a big TC head, can send me this information"
20:29;20:30;"if he still has it."
20:30;20:35;"My friend Jason Anderson wrote a really long history"
20:35;20:39;"that he completely fabricated about Count Chocula."
20:39;20:40;"- Whoa."
20:40;20:41;"- And it was on a Wikipedia,"
20:41;20:44;"he started the Count Chocula Wikipedia page"
20:44;20:45;"in like 2002 or whatever."
20:45;20:48;"- Probably before there were like thousands of people"
20:48;20:49;"double checking everything."
20:49;20:51;"- And he wrote this incredibly elaborate,"
20:51;20:55;"fictitious history about the real Count Chocula."
20:55;20:55;"- Whoa."
20:55;20:57;"- From like Bavaria."
20:57;21:00;"And it was all just completely invented and hilarious."
21:00;21:05;"And then he got very angry correspondence from Wikipedia."
21:05;21:06;"And they took it down."
21:06;21:07;"- Damn."
21:07;21:08;"- And they were like, you are not allowed to do this."
21:08;21:09;"- He got banned."
21:09;21:10;"- I don't know if he got banned,"
21:10;21:14;"but he got shut down hard, pretty fast."
21:14;21:15;"- Yeah."
21:15;21:17;"- But I remember at the time it was like,"
21:17;21:19;"I mean, it still is funny, but at the time it was like,"
21:19;21:22;"whoa dude, there's like this encyclopedia online"
21:22;21:25;"and you can just like, wait, what?"
21:25;21:26;"You just found it?"
21:26;21:28;"- Wait, the actual text?"
21:28;21:30;"- Ernest Chocula was born the third child"
21:30;21:34;"to Estonian landowners in the late autumn of 1873."
21:34;21:36;"His parents, Ivan and Bruskin Chocula,"
21:36;21:39;"were well-established traders of Baltic grain,"
21:39;21:41;"who by the early 20th century had established"
21:41;21:43;"a monopolistic hold on the export markets"
21:43;21:46;"of Lithuania, Latvia, and Southern Finland."
21:46;21:49;"A clever child, Ernst advanced quickly"
21:49;21:51;"through secondary schooling, and at the age of 19"
21:51;21:54;"was managing one of the six Tallinn area farms"
21:54;21:57;"along with his father and older brother, Grinch."
21:57;22:01;"By 24, he appeared in his first barreled cereal endorsement"
22:01;22:04;"as the Chocula family debuted Ernst Chocula's"
22:04;22:07;"golden wheat muesli, a packaged mix that was netted"
22:07;22:10;"for horses, mules, and the hospital ridden."
22:10;22:13;"Belarusian immigrant, Sola Tender,"
22:13;22:15;"started cutting the product with vodka,"
22:15;22:19;"creating a crude mush paste they called gruel or gruel,"
22:19;22:22;"and would eat the concoction each morning before work."
22:22;22:24;"The trend unwittingly spread with alcohol"
22:24;22:27;"being replaced by sheep and then cow's milk,"
22:27;22:29;"and the demand for the Chocula's cereal"
22:29;22:32;"reached as far south as Poland and as far west"
22:32;22:35;"as the northern Jutland province of Denmark."
22:35;22:37;"Wow, this is a long article."
22:37;22:39;"- Wait, so where is that text now?"
22:39;22:41;"- There's some like internet archive"
22:41;22:44;"that found my friend Jason's very elaborate"
22:44;22:46;"and hilarious fake history."
22:46;22:49;"- Well, he should submit because this is some"
22:49;22:51;"Droga 5 level (beep) actually."
22:51;22:53;"Look, it'd be one thing if there was a news story"
22:53;22:56;"that was like General Mills wants to make movies."
22:56;22:58;"Okay, cool, that comes and goes."
22:58;23:01;"But instead, they launched a website"
23:01;23:03;"called workwiththemonsters.com."

23:05;23:06;"workwiththemonsters.com."

27:41;27:43;"- Never understood those as snacks."
27:43;27:44;"- Yeah, but it is a classic snack."
27:44;27:46;"- No, but I don't understand it."
27:46;27:47;"Like, do you actually eat the seed?"
27:47;27:49;"- You eat the inside part and you spit out the shell."
27:49;27:52;"- Oh no, what is this, salted?"
27:52;27:53;"- Well, it comes in all different flavors."
27:53;27:55;"Like, you could probably get Chipotle barbecue"
27:55;27:56;"at this point."
27:56;27:58;"There's probably ranch sunflower seeds."
27:58;28:00;"It's very kind of American, but--"
28:00;28:03;"- So is that an ad you would see on TV?"
28:03;28:04;"- I don't know, I saw it on the internet."
28:04;28:06;"And it says, ""Be the snack king,"""
28:06;28:09;"and then it shows a box of Crunch 'n Munch."
28:09;28:10;"- Terrible snack."
28:10;28:12;"- Buttery toffee Crunch 'n Munch,"
28:12;28:16;"which is basically kind of like a Cracker Jack type thing."
28:16;28:19;"And then there's a show, David pumpkin seeds,"
28:19;28:23;"David sunflower seeds, then Slim Jim beef jerky,"
28:23;28:24;"and then some Slim Jim sticks."
28:24;28:26;"- That's a rough portfolio."
28:26;28:28;"- It's a rough portfolio, so I was like,"
28:28;28:30;"they're not even saying what the company is"
28:30;28:31;"that owns all these things."
28:31;28:33;"They're basically just saying,"
28:33;28:36;"we control so much of the snack share"
28:36;28:37;"of your local convenience store"
28:37;28:39;"that we're just encouraging you to snack, basically."
28:39;28:41;"We don't even need to be on some"
28:41;28:44;"brought to you by the whatever family of,"
28:44;28:45;"you know, they're just kind of saying,"
28:45;28:47;"'cause if Marvel was doing an ad"
28:47;28:49;"for their cinematic universe,"
28:49;28:52;"they would make sure, by the way, Aquaman, that's not us."
28:52;28:54;"This is kind of just like, go snack."
28:54;28:55;"Here's a bunch of different snacks."
28:55;28:57;"It's a very unfocused commercial."
28:57;28:59;"- And it's all very third tier stuff."
28:59;29:01;"- Yeah, this is like T-level snacks."
29:01;29:03;"- So then I was like, well, so what is this company"
29:03;29:06;"that's advertising all these different snacks at once?"
29:06;29:08;"It's a major company."
29:08;29:09;"- So they didn't say."
29:09;29:10;"- No, they don't say."
29:10;29:11;"- It was just sort of like,"
29:11;29:13;"really just washed over you very quickly."
29:13;29:14;"- It, yeah."
29:14;29:15;"- What's the point of that?"
29:15;29:17;"You're never gonna internalize that."
29:17;29:19;"- I guess they're trying to say, maybe--"
29:19;29:20;"- You're never gonna be like,"
29:20;29:22;"oh yeah, David sunflower seeds."
29:22;29:24;"- It's snack-aware, it's a snack PSA."
29:24;29:25;"- The best part, I guess they decided"
29:25;29:29;"it was better just to advertise being a snacker"
29:29;29:31;"than doing like, yeah, like maybe they're,"
29:31;29:32;"say their budget's a million dollars"
29:32;29:33;"and they're kind of like, okay,"
29:33;29:37;"so we'll give a 250 to our David guys."
29:37;29:38;"Here's 250 to the Slim Jim guys."
29:38;29:39;"Here's 250."
29:39;29:40;"They're like, no, (beep) this."
29:40;29:43;"Let's bet big on the whole portfolio"
29:43;29:45;"and just say, look, we basically own snacking."
29:45;29:46;"- You don't."
29:46;29:49;"You don't own Jack."
29:49;29:52;"And Slim Jim already had a great phrase."
29:52;29:54;"They already had a great advertising campaign."
29:54;29:55;"- Snap into a Slim Jim."
29:55;29:57;"- You're not gonna beat that."
29:57;29:59;"- I guess there's also something interesting"
29:59;30:02;"that because their portfolio is pretty rando,"
30:02;30:03;"I think they're also probably,"
30:03;30:04;"I can imagine people sitting around,"
30:04;30:06;"they're like, who are we?"
30:06;30:09;"We got Slim Jim, we got David, we got Crunch and Munch."
30:09;30:11;"We're not really a candy company."
30:11;30:12;"No, no, no, no, sir."
30:12;30:13;"You're not Mars."
30:13;30:14;"You're not the M&M company."
30:14;30:16;"Are we going head to head with Frito-Lay?"
30:16;30:18;"- The big boys?"
30:18;30:20;"- Oh no, we would get crushed by Frito-Lay."
30:20;30:21;"- You're not in the same league."
30:21;30:22;"- They own chips."
30:22;30:23;"- So you're not chips."
30:23;30:24;"You're not candy."
30:24;30:25;"What are you?"
30:25;30:26;"- You're not cookies."
30:26;30:27;"- You're not sweet."
30:27;30:28;"We're something different."
30:28;30:31;"We're that weird catch-all snack category."
30:31;30:33;"- We're basically things that are"
30:33;30:34;"kind of difficult to eat."
30:34;30:40;"Slim Jim, very hard, dense, brittle beef jerky,"
30:40;30:43;"and then Sunflower Seed, which you like."
30:43;30:44;"- And nobody wants that."
30:44;30:46;"- You suck on the Sunflower Seed."
30:46;30:49;"- And then Crunch and Munch is all up in your teeth."
30:49;30:51;"- It's like borderline inedible snacks."
30:51;30:53;"- So anyway, I'm watching this weird ass commercial"
30:53;30:55;"and I'm like, who the hell is this mystery company"
30:55;30:59;"that owns this random ass portfolio?"
30:59;31:01;"Turns out it's ConAgra Brands."
31:01;31:01;"- Heard of it."
31:01;31:03;"- A North American packaged food company"
31:03;31:05;"headquartered in Chicago, Illinois."
31:05;31:08;"ConAgra was founded in 1919."
31:08;31:11;"I know this is about to sound like some cat chugging."
31:11;31:14;"ConAgra was founded in 1919 by Frank Little"
31:14;31:17;"and Alva Kinney, who brought together four grain mills"
31:17;31:20;"as Nebraska Consolidated Mills."
31:20;31:22;"- This is a totally This Show Rules moment."
31:22;31:24;"- Oh, this is deeply This Show Rules."
31:24;31:28;"- I was just reading the ConAgra Wikipedia page."
31:28;31:31;"- It's a lot of big names that ConAgra owns."
31:31;31:36;"They own Act Two, microwave popcorn, Andy Capp's Fries."
31:36;31:37;"- I thought it was a comic strip."
31:37;31:38;"- No, it is."
31:38;31:40;"Andy Capp was, but Andy Capp's Fries is like,"
31:40;31:42;"definitely like a kind of third tier"
31:42;31:44;"vending machine item. - Like frozen French fries?"
31:44;31:46;"- No, it's a flavored corn and potato snack"
31:46;31:48;"made to look like French fries, but you eat it,"
31:48;31:49;"it's in a bag."
31:49;31:50;"- Okay, not familiar."
31:50;31:51;"- Chef Boyardee."
31:51;31:52;"- Okay, that's big."
31:52;31:53;"- That's big."
31:53;31:55;"- I see they have Aunt Jemima."
31:55;31:57;"- Chun King Chinese Style Foods."
31:57;32:00;"It's an American line of canned Chinese food products"
32:00;32:04;"founded in the 1940s by Gino Paolucci."
32:04;32:08;"- That's a film right there."
32:08;32:11;"You got an Italian guy in Brooklyn"
32:11;32:14;"being like, ""This Chinese food, let me tell ya."""
32:14;32:16;"- Yeah."
32:16;32:18;"Anyway, it's changed hands quite a few times,"
32:18;32:20;"but now it's owned by ConAgra."
32:20;32:20;"What else these guys got?"
32:20;32:23;"- They got Manwich, they got Marie Callender's."
32:23;32:26;"- It says here they got Fiddle, Faddle, and Crunch 'n Munch."
32:26;32:26;"- Oh yeah. - Both of which"
32:26;32:30;"are described as glazed popcorn slatched nut mixture."
32:30;32:31;"They got two?"
32:31;32:33;"- We gotta get in touch with the government, man."
32:33;32:35;"That's a monopoly."
32:35;32:38;"- Yeah, but Cracker Jack is the big dog in that field, so."
32:38;32:39;"- I guess they're like--"
32:39;32:41;"- They're a distant second and third."
32:41;32:43;"- How are we gonna take on Cracker Jack?"
32:43;32:44;"- Consolidate, dog."
32:44;32:47;"- Fiddle, Faddle, what do you say we put this beef aside"
32:47;32:48;"and team up?"
32:48;32:50;"You got it, Crunch 'n Munch."
32:50;32:52;"They also own Hebrew National Hot Dogs."
32:52;32:53;"Their portfolio is fascinating."
32:53;32:54;"- Fiddle, Faddle, let's face it,"
32:54;32:56;"the writing's on the wall."
32:56;32:58;"Cracker Jack's just running away, man."
32:58;33:02;"- It's like when Adidas bought Reebok."
33:02;33:03;"- They did?"
33:03;33:04;"- Yes, years ago. - Wow."
33:04;33:07;"- They're trying to gain on Nike, and I think it worked."
33:07;33:09;"They own Pam Cooking Oil."
33:09;33:10;"- Okay."
33:10;33:12;"- Peter Pan Peanut Butter."
33:12;33:14;"They own Poppycock."
33:14;33:15;"Give you one guess what that is."
33:15;33:18;"- It's a premium glazed popcorn nut mixture."
33:18;33:21;"- They got three glazed popcorn nut mixtures?"
33:21;33:24;"- They own Swiss Miss."
33:24;33:26;"That's pretty major."
33:26;33:27;"So basically, there's big names,"
33:27;33:31;"but it's truly an alliance of rando items."
33:31;33:32;"- It's an interesting strategy,"
33:32;33:33;"'cause they're playing the margins."
33:33;33:38;"I mean, they're buying second, third, fourth level"
33:38;33:41;"competitors in each category."
33:41;33:44;"They didn't buy Nestle Quick."
33:44;33:45;"I mean, Quick's don't buy Nestle."
33:45;33:47;"You can't buy Nestle, you can't buy Quick."
33:47;33:48;"They bought Swiss Miss."
33:48;33:49;"- Right."
33:49;33:51;"- I guess they're just, yeah, like playing the margins."
33:51;33:53;"Or it's some like Billy Bean stuff."
33:53;33:54;"- Yes, it's very money ball."
33:54;33:55;"- Very money ball."
33:55;33:58;"It's like you look for the stuff that is undervalued."
33:58;34:01;"The guy that only hits 270,"
34:01;34:04;"but his on-base percentage is like 370."
34:04;34:05;"He walks a lot."
34:05;34:06;"What's he do?"
34:06;34:07;"He gets on base."
34:07;34:07;"- You know what's funny?"
34:07;34:08;"- What do Swiss Miss do?"
34:08;34:09;"They get on base."
34:09;34:10;"- They get on base."
34:10;34:11;"You know what's funny?"
34:11;34:12;"That's hilarious."
34:12;34:13;"Recently, I was just like clicking around on YouTube,"
34:13;34:16;"and one of the suggested things to watch"
34:16;34:18;"was a scene from Moneyball."
34:18;34:20;"I was like, I like that movie, I'll watch it."
34:20;34:22;"And it was the scene where Brad Pitt"
34:22;34:25;"is kind of bringing Jonah Hill into the room"
34:25;34:26;"for the first time,"
34:26;34:28;"and he's there with all the old school guys,"
34:28;34:29;"and he's basically saying the new strategy,"
34:29;34:31;"which is, and these guys are pushing back,"
34:31;34:33;"but it's like a great scene to explain"
34:33;34:34;"what the new strategy is."
34:34;34:35;"Where he's kind of saying,"
34:35;34:36;"and we're gonna get this guy."
34:36;34:38;"And they're like, oh, but that guy can barely run."
34:38;34:39;"That guy's not that good."
34:39;34:40;"He flops."
34:40;34:41;"- Yeah, he's 37 years old."
34:41;34:44;"- And then he's like, he only bats 270s."
34:44;34:45;"That's all we need."
34:45;34:47;"And they're like, yeah, but the Red Sox"
34:47;34:48;"are trying to get rid of him."
34:48;34:50;"And he's like, exactly, so we can get him for cheap."
34:50;34:52;"And he's explaining, we buy players for cheap"
34:52;34:55;"who are just good enough for what we need."
34:55;34:56;"But where's our superstar?"
34:56;34:58;"You don't need a superstar."
34:58;34:59;"So you're totally right."
34:59;35:00;"Swiss Miss gets on base."
35:00;35:05;"- ConAgra is the Billy Bean of the snack food stew."
35:05;35:06;"- Snack ball."
35:06;35:08;"We gotta write snack ball."
35:08;35:08;"(laughing)"
35:08;35:10;"- That would rule."
35:10;35:11;"- Just like sitting there."
35:11;35:12;"- It's like the-- - The ConAgra film."
35:12;35:16;"- The two, just like a civil war in ConAgra,"
35:16;35:18;"somebody's like, we finally have enough money"
35:18;35:19;"to buy Snickers."
35:19;35:21;"We're betting big on Snickers."
35:21;35:22;"- Nope."
35:22;35:23;"- No, we are not."
35:23;35:24;"- We're passing."
35:24;35:25;"- What are you talking about?"
35:25;35:27;"It's a prestige brand."
35:27;35:29;"We don't need a prestige brand."
35:29;35:30;"Well, what do you suggest we buy?"
35:30;35:31;"Fiddle faddle."

36:22;36:24;"I love this Moneyball analogy."
36:24;36:26;"But I was kind of thinking,"
36:26;36:29;"based on the Snack King division,"
36:29;36:32;"if they want to brand their snack division so bad"
36:32;36:33;"and they want to own their weird,"
36:33;36:35;"kind of like second tier snack universe,"
36:35;36:37;"I think they should make a cinematic universe."
36:37;36:39;"And I was kind of thinking about it,"
36:39;36:43;"that the ConAgra cinematic universe"
36:43;36:44;"is so much more interesting"
36:44;36:47;"than the General Mills monster-verse."
36:47;36:48;"'Cause first of all, General Mills,"
36:48;36:50;"I also gotta say, I guess I wasn't clear enough"
36:50;36:54;"about what I think about the General Mills strategy."
36:54;36:54;"I think it's whack!"
36:54;36:56;"(explosion)"
36:56;36:57;"And here's why."
36:57;36:59;"Not because I don't respect General Mills, which I do."
36:59;37:00;"I do respect General Mills,"
37:00;37:02;"but they're not even picking"
37:02;37:03;"the interesting General Mills cereals."
37:03;37:06;"Like, turn Cheerios into a character."
37:06;37:07;"That'd be cool."
37:07;37:11;"Instead, they're picking this dumb mix of fake monsters."
37:11;37:14;"First of all, Universal already tried to do a monster-verse"
37:14;37:17;"using their old IP, like Frankenstein,"
37:17;37:18;"Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy."
37:18;37:19;"And that barely worked."
37:19;37:22;"We barely want to see Dracula, let alone Count Chocula."
37:22;37:24;"We barely want to see Frankenstein, let alone Frankenberry."
37:24;37:27;"So already, it's a copy of a copy."
37:27;37:28;"You know what I'm saying?"
37:28;37:29;"It's not original."
37:29;37:32;"Whereas, I would say that the ConAgra cinematic universe"
37:32;37:34;"has a lot more potential."
37:34;37:36;"The thing that caught me is that the big three brands"
37:36;37:38;"they're trying to promote here are Slim Jim,"
37:38;37:41;"David Sunflower Seeds, and Crunch 'N Munch."
37:41;37:42;"Now, the first two,"
37:42;37:44;"I think we could have a lot of fun casting it."
37:44;37:46;"- Oh, the Slim Jim movie would be amazing."
37:46;37:49;"- Slim Jim, you turn it into a guy."
37:49;37:52;"He's an all-American, kind of tall, skinny guy."
37:52;37:53;"Maybe a Sam Elliott."
37:53;37:54;"He could be a Slim Jim."
37:54;37:55;"- Like a cowboy."
37:55;37:56;"It's a Western."
37:56;37:58;"- And then David Sunflower Seeds,"
37:58;38:00;"kind of maybe like a kind of nerdy guy."
38:00;38:03;"Maybe, you know, he's the brains of the operation."
38:03;38:05;"And then Crunch, I don't know who Crunch 'N Munch is,"
38:05;38:06;"but you know what I'm saying?"
38:06;38:07;"That's interesting."
38:07;38:12;"That is gonna attract a higher caliber of writer talent,"
38:12;38:13;"because you're not just saying,"
38:13;38:15;"""Hey guys, we wanna make a stupid movie"
38:15;38:17;"""about a fake Frankenstein."""
38:17;38:18;"That's undignified."
38:18;38:21;"The ConAgra brand, there's something scrappy about it."
38:21;38:24;"You know, there's some good energy there that I like."
38:24;38:25;"- Wide open."
38:25;38:25;"- Yeah."
38:25;38:26;"Slim Jim. - The Coen brothers"
38:26;38:27;"could do a Slim Jim movie."
38:27;38:28;"- Oh yeah, they could crush it."
38:28;38:30;"- I mean, they just made that--"
38:30;38:31;"- Ballad of Buster Scruggs?"
38:31;38:32;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
38:32;38:33;"- Compilation of Western shorts."
38:33;38:37;"They could've cut that last one and done a Slim Jim one."
38:37;38:38;"- You remember there was a movie in the '80s,"
38:38;38:39;"I never actually saw it,"
38:39;38:41;"but I remember always singing to the video store"
38:41;38:45;"that was called Harley Davidson Meets the Marlboro Man?"
38:45;38:46;"- No."
38:46;38:47;"- It's a feature film where--"
38:47;38:48;"- Wow."
38:48;38:50;"- Two all-American brands,"
38:50;38:53;"who often are marketed to the same type of person,"
38:53;38:55;"Harley Davidson Motorcycles and Marlboro Cigarettes,"
38:55;38:56;"became people."
38:56;38:59;"The Marlboro Man was already kind of in the ads."
38:59;39:01;"So Harley Davidson's like a badass biker,"
39:01;39:03;"and then Marlboro Man is like a badass"
39:03;39:05;"cowboy cigarette smoker,"
39:05;39:06;"and I don't know what happens in the movie,"
39:06;39:07;"but maybe they're enemies,"
39:07;39:09;"and then they have to team up and go on an adventure."
39:09;39:13;"- That sounds like such a video art piece at MoMA."
39:13;39:15;"- Yeah, Harley Davidson."
39:15;39:18;"- Like, let's challenge notions of American masculinity."
39:18;39:19;"- Right."
39:19;39:20;"- It's an all-star cast in that film."
39:20;39:21;"- Who's in it?"
39:21;39:23;"- Mickey Rourke and Don Johnson."
39:23;39:24;"- Oh jeez. - Oh, whoa."
39:24;39:25;"- Serious."
39:25;39:27;"- Also Tom Sizemore and Vanessa Williams."
39:27;39:29;"- And that got a theatrical release?"
39:29;39:30;"How did it do?"
39:30;39:33;"- It did get a theatrical release 1991."
39:33;39:34;"- That was in the 90s?"
39:34;39:36;"- $7 million at the box office,"
39:36;39:38;"budget of $23 million."
39:38;39:40;"- Ouch. - Oh, that's not great."
39:40;39:42;"- Looks like there was a character"
39:42;39:44;"called Jack Daniels also in it."
39:44;39:47;"And Daniel Baldwin was also in the film."
39:47;39:50;"- That's tight, but it's such like video art."
39:50;39:54;"- I love that someone lost like $16 million on that."
39:54;39:55;"- On a Harley, well, who knows?"
39:55;39:57;"Maybe they made it up with the video sales."
39:57;39:59;"- Maybe."
39:59;40:01;"- Maybe they're turning a profit by now."
40:01;40:03;"Anyway, if they can make a Harley Davidson"
40:03;40:04;"meets a Marlboro Man movie,"
40:04;40:07;"at least we could do a Slim Jim meets David Sunflower."

41:37;41:38;"on this week's episode."
41:38;41:40;"First, we got Vic Berger."
41:40;41:43;"Now, Seinfeld, you and Vic Berger used to be colleagues?"
41:43;41:47;"- Yeah, and we were kind of, how can I put it?"
41:47;41:50;"I was just kind of the point person for Vic."
41:50;41:52;"I can't really take any credit for his brilliance,"
41:52;41:55;"but he's just an amazing editor."
41:55;41:58;"- You're both great editors who make funny videos."
41:58;41:59;"I mean, how do you even describe Vic?"
41:59;42:01;"- I mean, he's an absurdist editor,"
42:01;42:05;"and he has a real knack for observing things"
42:05;42:07;"that other people may not."
42:07;42:11;"So he can watch something and spot somebody in a crowd"
42:11;42:14;"doing something really unusual in a crowd of 100 people"
42:14;42:17;"and construct a narrative about them."
42:17;42:18;"- Zoom in on it."
42:18;42:21;"I mean, I followed Vic on the various social media formats"
42:21;42:23;"for a few years, and I always thought he was very funny,"
42:23;42:25;"but it was in the 2016 election,"
42:25;42:27;"he really took it to the next level."
42:27;42:29;"And there's a video that he made"
42:29;42:32;"that was kind of some of Jeb Bush's greatest hits"
42:32;42:33;"on the campaign trail."
42:33;42:36;"I must've watched that 20 times,"
42:36;42:39;"where it's kind of like all these sad Jeb Bush moments,"
42:39;42:41;"then he keeps having Trump over and over again go,"
42:41;42:43;"""Jeb is a mess."""
42:43;42:44;"- Jeb is a mess."
42:44;42:47;"- And then just Jeb going, ""Please clap,"""
42:47;42:48;"and all like the kind of classics."
42:48;42:51;"And he puts it together in this kind of absurdist,"
42:51;42:56;"spooky, post-hymenaric, gorgeous video."
42:56;42:57;"It's very unnerving."
42:58;43:00;"- The people of Iowa and New Hampshire"
43:00;43:02;"and South Carolina have spoken,"
43:02;43:04;"and I really respect their decision."
43:04;43:07;"So tonight I am suspending my campaign."
43:07;43:08;"Yeah, yeah."
43:08;43:17;"But no matter what the future holds,"
43:17;43:21;"here's the greatest safety landing, if you can imagine."
43:21;43:23;"Tonight I'm gonna sleep with the best friend I have"
43:23;43:24;"and the love of my life."
43:24;43:29;"- But anyway, Vic, he's not just a comedian/absurdist editor,"
43:29;43:31;"he's also a musician."
43:31;43:33;"And he's dropping an album out December 14th,"
43:33;43:34;"so we're gonna get him on the phone,"
43:34;43:35;"chop it up with Vic,"
43:35;43:39;"and we're gonna play a song from his forthcoming album."
43:39;43:42;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
43:42;43:45;"(phone ringing)"
43:45;43:47;"- Hello?"
43:47;43:47;"- Hey Vic, how you doing?"
43:47;43:50;"This is Ezra and Jake from Time Crisis."
43:50;43:51;"- Hey, how's it going?"
43:51;43:52;"- And don't forget about Seinfeld 2000,"
43:52;43:53;"but you already know him."
43:53;43:55;"- Oh yeah, oh I know him."
43:55;43:56;"- Hey Vic. - Very well."
43:56;43:58;"Hey, how you doing, man?"
43:58;43:58;"- I'm good."
43:58;44:01;"- So Vic, I imagine probably a lot of TC heads"
44:01;44:02;"are acquainted with your work."
44:02;44:05;"We were trying to figure out, how do you describe yourself?"
44:05;44:07;"When you're talking to some kind of random person,"
44:07;44:08;"what do you say?"
44:08;44:10;"- Right, that's a tough question."
44:10;44:12;"I mean, I'm a weirdo, you know,"
44:12;44:15;"so I have weird tendencies,"
44:15;44:19;"and sometimes I don't always know how to properly"
44:19;44:23;"get them across, so I kind of delved into the arts,"
44:23;44:26;"and you know, music, and now video editing,"
44:26;44:28;"'cause I've been doing this about four years now,"
44:28;44:29;"three and a half years,"
44:29;44:32;"and that's my preferred way of expressing myself."
44:32;44:36;"So I guess I kind of say I'm an artist,"
44:36;44:38;"but I focus on video,"
44:38;44:43;"and I repurpose a lot of footage that exists already"
44:43;44:45;"to comment on things,"
44:45;44:49;"or just to make something that's funny to me."
44:49;44:52;"- I was just saying that your kind of Jeb Bush wrap-up"
44:52;44:55;"is one of my favorite videos of all time."
44:55;44:56;"- Awesome, thank you."
44:56;44:57;"- It's like weird."
44:57;45:00;"It's like every time somebody says the word mess,"
45:00;45:02;"you know how like everybody has some weird reference"
45:02;45:03;"or something?"
45:03;45:04;"It's like just be like at home,"
45:04;45:05;"and somebody be like, ""Whoa, the kitchen's a mess,"""
45:05;45:07;"and I'll just like, to no one in particular,"
45:07;45:09;"be like, ""Jeb is a mess,"""
45:09;45:12;"which obviously Trump said,"
45:12;45:16;"but you zeroed in on and turned into something special."
45:16;45:20;"- Actually, one little tidbit is he never actually said that."
45:20;45:22;"(explosion)"
45:22;45:23;"- What?"
45:23;45:25;"- I spliced that together, yeah."
45:25;45:26;"- What did he actually say?"
45:26;45:29;"- I think he was just saying our country's a mess,"
45:29;45:34;"you know, just how bad Obama was doing that."
45:34;45:35;"It's such a mess, yeah."
45:35;45:36;"- Okay, so you did make Jeb,"
45:36;45:38;"you really made Jeb, not only, okay."
45:38;45:40;"- Yes, yes."
45:40;45:43;"- So we're curious about your new album"
45:43;45:44;"because I noticed the title is"
45:44;45:47;"""The Cabinets in the Cupboard,"""
45:47;45:50;"and then in parentheses, 2000 to 2012."
45:50;45:54;"Now, if in fact these recordings are not from 2000, 2012,"
45:54;45:55;"that'd be very fascinating."
45:55;45:57;"- Yes, that would be absurd."
45:57;45:58;"- I have a feeling they are."
45:58;45:59;"- Yeah."
45:59;45:59;"- What's the backstory?"
45:59;46:02;"- Well, since middle school, high school,"
46:02;46:04;"I always wanted to go into music"
46:04;46:08;"and basically be like a Brian Wilson or something like that."
46:08;46:10;"Hanging out in the studio all day,"
46:10;46:13;"recording, writing songs, doing all that."
46:13;46:15;"But then I found out that that's very difficult to do"
46:15;46:18;"and thought, ""All right, I gotta go to college,"
46:18;46:20;"""so let's go to school for music."""
46:20;46:25;"And so I did that and I got into songwriting while there."
46:25;46:29;"And from there, I just kind of, you know,"
46:29;46:32;"I'd be in my bedroom writing and recording songs all the time"
46:32;46:35;"and never really knew how to get them out there."
46:35;46:37;"I'm not very good at self-promotion"
46:37;46:40;"and not a whole lot of confidence in that department."
46:40;46:44;"So I kind of just, maybe a handful of people over the years"
46:44;46:49;"have heard them and I had maybe a couple hundred songs."
46:49;46:52;"And then as I started to get a little bit known"
46:52;46:55;"for the video, now and then I would put out a song"
46:55;46:57;"just for people to follow me to check out."
46:57;47:01;"And then Jared Sheik from Philanthrograph Records"
47:01;47:03;"came across them, something I posted,"
47:03;47:06;"and he said, ""Yeah, you have any more of those songs?"""
47:06;47:08;"So I just sent him everything."
47:08;47:11;"And he picked his 12 favorite."
47:11;47:12;"And so that's what it is."
47:12;47:13;"It's all stuff."
47:13;47:17;"There's a song in there I recorded when I was 17"
47:17;47:19;"in my high school auditorium."
47:19;47:22;"And there's a lot of more personal stuff."
47:22;47:25;"Some stuff I wrote and recorded for my wife"
47:25;47:26;"when we first met."
47:26;47:29;"And so that's kind of a more personal thing."
47:29;47:30;"- Right, so it's a compilation,"
47:30;47:33;"but it's also kind of your debut album in a way."
47:33;47:36;"- Yes, yeah, yeah."
47:36;47:39;"Stuff that's been on the shelf for a very long time."
47:39;47:40;"But yeah, first release ever."
47:40;47:41;"- Okay, great."
47:41;47:43;"Well, we're gonna play track two"
47:43;47:44;"from The Cabinets in the Cupboard."
47:44;47:46;"This one's called Every Time I Get Close to You."
47:46;47:50;"When in the 2000, 2012 range is this song from?"
47:50;47:52;"- This is from 2007."
47:52;47:55;"So when I was, at the time, living in Jersey City."
47:55;47:56;"- You live in Jersey City?"
47:56;47:58;"- I did for about three months"
47:58;48:03;"when my wife was going to NYU for her master's."
48:03;48:05;"And we lived there for a little bit."
48:05;48:08;"- Spent a lot of time on the Pathtrend, Journal Square."
48:08;48:10;"- Yes, oh yeah, yep."
48:10;48:11;"- I love it."

51:33;51:35;"""Every Time I Get Close to You."""
51:35;51:37;"Vic, last question for you."
51:37;51:38;"What's going on?"
51:38;51:39;"- What's going on?"
51:39;51:40;"- In the world today."
51:40;51:42;"I mean, you're somebody who lives at the intersection"
51:42;51:45;"of art, politics, funny (beep), serious (beep)."
51:45;51:46;"What's going on?"
51:46;51:48;"It's almost the end of the year."
51:48;51:50;"Are things looking up for 2019?"
51:50;51:52;"- I am, I'm actually positive."
51:52;51:54;"I think all the negative, hateful stuff"
51:54;51:58;"that has been uncovered, the sunlight is shining on it."
51:58;51:59;"It's shining on down."
51:59;52:02;"And I think things are gonna be looking up"
52:02;52:03;"from the new year on."
52:03;52:05;"I just feel, I mean, it can't get worse, can it?"
52:05;52:07;"I mean, can it get much worse than that?"
52:07;52:10;"I think we're gonna be on the way up here,"
52:10;52:11;"my prediction."
52:11;52:12;"- I agree."
52:12;52:14;"The power of positive thinking."
52:14;52:15;"All right, well, thanks so much for calling in, Vic."
52:15;52:18;"And hope to meet you in person sometime soon."
52:18;52:19;"- Yeah, definitely, definitely."
52:19;52:20;"- All right, have a good one, man."
52:20;52:21;"- All right, thanks, guys."
52:21;52:21;"- All right, bye."
52:21;52:22;"- Thanks, Vic. - Bye."
52:22;52:24;"- Now we're gonna talk to another artist."
52:24;52:26;"Graphic designer, Andrew Smith,"
52:26;52:28;"creator of the Joker Man font."
52:28;52:32;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
52:32;52:34;"(phone ringing)"
52:34;52:36;"- Hello?"
52:36;52:37;"- Is that Andrew?"
52:37;52:38;"- Yes, it is."
52:38;52:39;"- Hi, Andrew, you're on Time Crisis"
52:39;52:41;"with Ezra, Jake, and Seinfeld 2000."
52:41;52:42;"- Hi, how are you?"
52:42;52:44;"- We're great, thank you so much"
52:44;52:46;"for taking the time to call in."
52:46;52:46;"- That's all right."
52:46;52:47;"- We have so many questions."
52:47;52:49;"Don't even know where to begin."
52:49;52:51;"I mean, so first of all,"
52:51;52:52;"what's the best way to describe you?"
52:52;52:55;"You're a graphic designer who also creates typefaces,"
52:55;52:57;"or is there a specific word for somebody"
52:57;52:59;"who makes fonts and typefaces?"
52:59;53:00;"- Yeah, I suppose you could say,"
53:00;53:02;"yeah, I am a graphic designer,"
53:02;53:05;"but a typographer as well, I suppose you could call me."
53:05;53:07;"You know, type designer."
53:07;53:10;"- Okay, so you're a type designer and graphic designer."
53:10;53:12;"Okay, so the first question I gotta ask,"
53:12;53:14;"because even right here on my notes,"
53:14;53:15;"we wrote Joker Man font,"
53:15;53:17;"and we've been talking about Joker Man"
53:17;53:19;"quite a bit on the show,"
53:19;53:22;"and I've noticed that it rubs some people the wrong way"
53:22;53:26;"because there's a debate about whether you call it"
53:26;53:28;"a font or a typeface,"
53:28;53:31;"and I think the Joe Schmo on the street,"
53:31;53:33;"Joe Sixpack, has decided that font and typeface"
53:33;53:34;"mean the same thing,"
53:34;53:36;"and I'll admit, I am a Joe Schmo,"
53:36;53:38;"but for someone like you,"
53:38;53:39;"can we call Joker Man a font,"
53:39;53:41;"or is it a typeface?"
53:41;53:43;"- I'd say they're the same thing, aren't they?"
53:43;53:45;"I mean, I don't understand why people"
53:45;53:47;"are calling them two different things."
53:47;53:48;"- Thank you."
53:48;53:49;"You heard it here."
53:49;53:52;"Andrew Smith has laid down the law."
53:52;53:53;"Fonts and typefaces are the same."
53:53;53:55;"I mean, I looked it up, of course,"
53:55;53:56;"when I started getting these messages"
53:56;53:58;"that were kind of where people were kind of saying,"
53:58;53:59;"like, what's the matter with you, man?"
53:59;54:01;"It's not a font, it's a typeface,"
54:01;54:03;"and it seemed like there used to be a distinction"
54:03;54:06;"when people were literally laying letters"
54:06;54:07;"into a printing press."
54:07;54:10;"- Yeah, that's probably where the font side of things"
54:10;54:11;"comes from, doesn't it?"
54:11;54:14;"So, I mean, the term typeface is probably more"
54:14;54:18;"for computers and the digital side of things,"
54:18;54:21;"and that's probably where that's sort of come from"
54:21;54:23;"in the last 20 years or so."
54:23;54:25;"- One thing that's interesting about Joker Man"
54:25;54:28;"is everybody knows this font,"
54:28;54:30;"but not everybody knows the name."
54:30;54:32;"Like, I've been pointing out examples of it,"
54:32;54:35;"and then suddenly everybody, all my Instagram followers,"
54:35;54:36;"now they're seeing it everywhere."
54:36;54:39;"It's kind of once, it's like you learn the language,"
54:39;54:40;"and now you see it everywhere,"
54:40;54:42;"'cause here in LA, I saw Barbershop,"
54:42;54:44;"the sign was in Joker Man."
54:44;54:46;"So it's a very influential font."
54:46;54:49;"And so is it named after the Bob Dylan song, Joker Man?"
54:49;54:50;"- Yes, it is."
54:50;54:51;"- Oh! - That's awesome."
54:51;54:52;"- Yes, that's awesome."
54:52;54:54;"- I'm a big Bob Dylan fan,"
54:54;54:56;"and I wanted to pay tribute to him,"
54:56;55:01;"and I like the song, and I thought that's quite a funky name,"
55:01;55:04;"and it goes with the style of the font."
55:04;55:07;"So it is, you're right, it is from the Bob Dylan song."
55:07;55:09;"- I'm so happy to have confirmation that I--"
55:09;55:10;"- That is gratifying."
55:10;55:11;"- I also love that song,"
55:11;55:15;"and my band has been rehearsing a cover of it."
55:15;55:17;"- Oh, okay, yep, and how's it going?"
55:17;55:18;"- It's good, we kind of jammed it out,"
55:18;55:20;"and it's already a six-minute song,"
55:20;55:22;"we have an 11-minute version."
55:22;55:23;"- Wow. - 11-minute Joker Man,"
55:23;55:25;"but I think it's one of his best songs of the '80s."
55:25;55:27;"- Definitely, yeah."

56:14;56:18;"- Okay, so it's 1995, you're creating this font,"
56:18;56:22;"Joker Man, are you making it for Microsoft?"
56:22;56:25;"- Oh, no, no, we're not making it for Microsoft, no."
56:25;56:26;"Have you heard of Letraset?"
56:26;56:28;"- Sounds familiar, I'm not sure what that is."
56:28;56:32;"- It was a big company in the sort of '60s and '70s and '80s."
56:32;56:36;"They used to make dry transfer lettering."
56:36;56:39;"So back in the old days before computers,"
56:39;56:41;"if you wanted to design a layout,"
56:41;56:43;"you'd buy your dry transfer lettering"
56:43;56:47;"and you'd have to rub down the letters and space it out."
56:47;56:50;"So I worked for this company, Letraset."
56:50;56:53;"I worked in the type studio and we digitized fonts"
56:53;56:54;"and we designed fonts."
56:54;56:57;"So that's where I sort of learned my craft"
56:57;57:02;"and that's how I started to design fonts, typefaces."
57:02;57:03;"- Can you paint a picture for us?"
57:03;57:06;"At that point, 1995, you're making Joker Man."
57:06;57:09;"Are you thinking about how this font's gonna be used?"
57:09;57:12;"Are you seeing a hole in the marketplace"
57:12;57:13;"that you're trying to fill with this font?"
57:13;57:16;"Did you have like an ethos going into the creation of it?"
57:16;57:19;"- I wasn't thinking how people were gonna use it"
57:19;57:20;"or anything like that."
57:20;57:24;"It was more about, I suppose in those days,"
57:24;57:28;"the more creative, crazier type of wackier fonts,"
57:28;57:30;"there weren't a lot of those around."
57:30;57:34;"So people were starting to do these sort of"
57:34;57:35;"more creative typefaces."
57:35;57:39;"So that was sort of where it sort of stemmed from."
57:39;57:42;"I didn't have an ethos, as you say."
57:42;57:43;"I just came up with an idea."
57:43;57:46;"It wasn't influenced by anything."
57:46;57:48;"It was just, I just thought of it."
57:48;57:52;"- It's interesting 'cause we were talking before,"
57:52;57:54;"like Joker Man, when you see the font used,"
57:54;57:55;"people have been sending me examples."
57:55;57:57;"It's like so many different types of things."
57:57;57:58;"It can be--"
57:58;57:59;"- Well, what's it being used on then?"
57:59;58:00;"What have you found?"
58:00;58:02;"- Well, like I said, in LA,"
58:02;58:06;"there's a barber shop in Hollywood that uses Joker Man."
58:06;58:10;"Definitely seen it used occasionally with stores"
58:10;58:13;"and things related to children, like a toy shop."
58:13;58:16;"'Cause I think there's a kind of whimsical nature"
58:16;58:17;"to Joker Man."
58:17;58:20;"We saw that, you know there's this festival in the US"
58:20;58:21;"called Burning Man?"
58:21;58:22;"- No, I don't know about that."
58:22;58:24;"- It's kind of, how do you describe it?"
58:24;58:29;"It's a big techno hippie utopian festival out in the desert."
58:29;58:30;"Which is very popular now."
58:30;58:32;"And they build a giant man,"
58:32;58:35;"they burn it at the end of every festival, every year."
58:35;58:37;"And somebody sent us a picture that one year,"
58:37;58:42;"they put the ashes of the 2001 Burning Man in a jar"
58:42;58:44;"that the founders of the festival keep somewhere."
58:44;58:46;"And the jar was labeled in Joker Man."
58:46;58:48;"So, you know, that's this kind of"
58:48;58:51;"techno utopian hippie festival."
58:51;58:54;"And they chose Joker Man, at least in one small way,"
58:54;58:56;"to represent the festival."
58:56;59:00;"So, if I had to say some of the repeated types of places,"
59:00;59:03;"I'd say things related to childhood and fun and toys."
59:03;59:04;"- Right, okay."
59:04;59:05;"- And definitely coffee shops too."
59:05;59:08;"Like, I've even seen Joker Man referred to"
59:08;59:11;"as part of a larger set of fonts called Global Coffeehouse."
59:11;59:12;"Which reminds people of kind of like"
59:12;59:14;"a 90s coffeehouse vibe."
59:14;59:16;"So I'm curious, when you hear about these different things,"
59:16;59:19;"as the creator of the font itself,"
59:19;59:20;"do these resonate with you at all?"
59:20;59:21;"You're just kind of like, that's interesting,"
59:21;59:23;"people are gonna do what they do."
59:23;59:24;"Does it make sense to you?"
59:24;59:28;"- Sort of, I mean, how people wanna use the typeface"
59:28;59:30;"is up to them, if they think it works."
59:30;59:32;"I mean, that's fine with me, but I mean,"
59:32;59:35;"some of those sound a bit, I never envisaged"
59:35;59:38;"that it would be used for some of the things"
59:38;59:38;"you just mentioned."
59:38;59:39;"- Right."
59:39;59:41;"As I was kind of looking through your font portfolio,"
59:41;59:44;"I was also interested to see that Joker Man,"
59:44;59:48;"I've even occasionally been seeing kind of knockoffs,"
59:48;59:49;"and then I kind of had to go check,"
59:49;59:51;"and I was like, oh wait, that's not actually Joker Man."
59:51;59:53;"But there's kind of a lot of similar fonts,"
59:53;59:54;"and one of which, not a knockoff,"
59:54;59:57;"but one that you created that's almost like a sister font,"
59:57;59:58;"is Laughin'."
59:58;59:59;"- Right, yeah."
59:59;01:00:02;"- How are those fonts related to you?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- Yeah, they're quite similar, I suppose."
01:00:04;01:00:07;"That one's not as popular as Joker Man,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"so I prefer Joker Man, maybe because it was"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"the one I did first, so."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"- Oh, so that's the original."
01:00:13;01:00:14;"- Yeah."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"- They both have this kind of motif of dots"
01:00:16;01:00:17;"to the side of certain letters?"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- Yeah, there's no theory with that,"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"it's just what's come out on the page, you know,"
01:00:21;01:00:26;"so I wouldn't read too deeply into the two of them."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"- I've already written a few hundred pages of my thesis."
01:00:29;01:00:30;"- Have you?"
01:00:30;01:00:32;"- No, I am curious about the relationship."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"I mean, I'm also--"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"- Are you doing the thesis on this or something?"
01:00:35;01:00:38;"- No, no, somebody suggested to me that somebody"
01:00:38;01:00:41;"should make a book of Joker Man called Joker Man Wild."
01:00:41;01:00:43;"I forget who, it's such a good name,"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"I forget it was somebody on the internet."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"Joker Man Wild, which would be a coffee table book"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"of Joker Man font in the wild, you know,"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"like on signs and things like that."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"- Wow."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"- We need your permission for that."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"But one question I have,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"is Joker Man your most popular font you've been a part of?"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"'Cause as I look through your portfolio,"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"I definitely see a lot of familiar faces."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"- I know Smudge has done quite well."
01:01:07;01:01:10;"That's a sort of a brush script font I've done."
01:01:10;01:01:14;"And also my John Lennon font, Goo Goo Gajoob."
01:01:14;01:01:15;"Have you seen that one?"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"- Oh, I noticed that, so I guess that you have"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"at least two fonts that are indebted to songs."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"- Yeah, I mean, I am working on a Dylan font"
01:01:22;01:01:24;"at the moment as well, actually."
01:01:24;01:01:24;"- Oh, really?"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"- Yeah, but I've only just started thinking of that"
01:01:27;01:01:30;"at the moment, so I'll keep you posted."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"- Oh yeah, we'd love to see that."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"And one that also jumped out to me,"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"which was very familiar to me, Chiller."
01:01:35;01:01:39;"It's kind of a slightly spooky, handwritten font."
01:01:39;01:01:40;"But then you look at it and you're like,"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"but it's very specific."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"There's a lot of things that could be like that,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"and yet that's the one, you know?"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"So Chiller seems very popular to me."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- Yeah, that is."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"And the reason I called it Chiller,"
01:01:49;01:01:52;"'cause I happened to be watching a Hitchcock film"
01:01:52;01:01:55;"at the time when I was working on it."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"So I just thought Chiller was quite a nice name."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"And because it's called Chiller,"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"I think it lends people to use it"
01:02:01;01:02:06;"for the more sort of horror-type applications."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"- Oh yeah, that's interesting."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"If you hadn't called it Chiller,"
01:02:08;01:02:10;"yeah, 'cause as soon as I see it"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"and you see it written out in the word Chiller,"
01:02:12;01:02:13;"you just think it's spooky."
01:02:13;01:02:17;"But if you had called that one Sunny, who knows?"
01:02:17;01:02:21;"- I mean, the names of fonts, you know, or typefaces,"
01:02:21;01:02:25;"it does sort of psychologically affect how they get used."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"And obviously the name helps, you know,"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"like people are looking for a horror font,"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"then, you know, something called Chiller"
01:02:32;01:02:34;"would come up in a search or something."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"So that does influence people's sort of use of them,"
01:02:38;01:02:39;"if you see what I mean."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"- No, totally."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"It's like if ""Joker Man"" had been called like New Jersey."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"(laughing)"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"People would have had very different associations with it."

01:03:36;01:03:37;"I don't know when the last time you listened"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"to the song ""Joker Man"" was,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"but it's a very mysterious song."
01:03:41;01:03:43;"And I would say it's a mysterious font as well."
01:03:43;01:03:46;"What does the phrase ""Joker Man"" connote to you?"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"And I understand the font, you know,"
01:03:47;01:03:50;"that's something you made that goes out to the world"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"and they use it how they want to."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"But can you take us back before it was a font?"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Like, and you heard the song ""Joker Man,"""
01:03:55;01:03:56;"it is such a mysterious phrase."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"And actually I checked, I was curious about"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"what are the roots of this phrase ""Joker Man?"""
01:04:00;01:04:02;"'Cause we all know there's a joker,"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"and we know what man means,"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Joker Man, it seems natural."
01:04:04;01:04:07;"Like for all I know, Joker Man is, you know,"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"a figure that you'd find in history books."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"And I did that Google book search"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"where you can search like 19th century, 20th century."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"- Okay. - And until the Dylan song,"
01:04:15;01:04:19;"the phrase ""Joker Man,"" you barely find."
01:04:19;01:04:21;"You know, occasionally you'll find somebody says"
01:04:21;01:04:24;"""Joker,"" comma, ""Man,"" or, you know,"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"once or twice ""Joker Man,"""
01:04:25;01:04:27;"like as if it was somebody's name or something."
01:04:27;01:04:30;"But the character of Joker Man"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"didn't really exist until the Dylan song."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"So we talked on this show about,"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"like, what do we think Joker Man is?"
01:04:36;01:04:39;"I have a theory that it's a Joker plus Batman"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"representing the duality of man."
01:04:41;01:04:42;"- Wow. - But I'm curious,"
01:04:42;01:04:45;"do you have an interpretation of this figure of the Joker Man?"
01:04:45;01:04:46;"Not really. I mean, it's--"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"because I wanted to pay homage to Dylan,"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"I just like the name ""Joker Man,"""
01:04:51;01:04:52;"and I like the song,"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"so I didn't really read too deeply"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"into the meaning of it."
01:04:56;01:05:01;"You've obviously really gone into it quite deeply."
01:05:01;01:05:02;"I have."
01:05:02;01:05:03;"It's a bit of an obsession, is it?"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"It's a bit of an obs-- this kind of reminds me"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"of there's a part I remember as a kid"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"watching this John Lennon documentary"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"where this American hippie, like,"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"climbs the wall to his house,"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"and John Lennon comes out, and he's like,"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"""What do you want, man?"""
01:05:15;01:05:18;"And he's just like, ""Well, I listened to your record,"
01:05:18;01:05:21;"and, you know, I understood the meaning of the song,"
01:05:21;01:05:22;"and you were talking to me."""
01:05:22;01:05:24;"And John Lennon goes, ""I wasn't talking to you."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"I don't even know you. It's just a song."""
01:05:26;01:05:28;"And the guy's kind of like, ""All right, man."""
01:05:28;01:05:30;"[laughter]"
01:05:30;01:05:32;"So you said you're working on a Dylan font."
01:05:32;01:05:34;"What else are you working on these days"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"outside of fonts?"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I'm a freelance designer,"
01:05:37;01:05:40;"so it's just a bit of all sorts, really,"
01:05:40;01:05:43;"whatever I can get, you know, in terms of work."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Are you open to collaboration?"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"In what respect?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"I don't know."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"I've got this band, Vampire Weekend."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"We always need some ideas,"
01:05:49;01:05:51;"and we actually kind of wanted to do a Joker Man shirt,"
01:05:51;01:05:54;"but maybe we could come up with something together."
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Well, that sounds interesting, yeah."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"I don't want to put you on the spot,"
01:05:57;01:06:00;"but you might be open to helping us make a font,"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"a Vampire Weekend font?"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"Wow. A whole font."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"Well, again, I don't know."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"That's caps and lowercase."
01:06:06;01:06:09;"We don't have to start negotiating fees on air, but..."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"You've done some drawings, have you?"
01:06:10;01:06:12;"No. I would probably send you..."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"You're out of your depth here, bud."
01:06:13;01:06:14;"Well, look, I'm a vibe guy."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Yeah, I know."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"I would probably send you a series of phrases"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"and maybe a mood board."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Oh, right, yeah."
01:06:21;01:06:23;"And what would be on the mood board, then?"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"Maybe some music. I could send you our new album."
01:06:25;01:06:26;"Well, that would be great, yeah."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Almost nobody's heard it, but I'd send it to you, sure."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Well, Andrew, no matter what,"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"we actually, on Time Crisis,"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"we make some shirts,"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"and we used Joker Man recently"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"on the back of one of our shirts."
01:06:37;01:06:38;"Thank you very much."
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Everybody's been loving that."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"The front is Futura Bold,"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"says ""8-minute Cape Cod,"""
01:06:42;01:06:45;"and the back says ""This show rules"" and ""Joker Man."""
01:06:45;01:06:46;"But actually, we've been talking about it."
01:06:46;01:06:48;"We've got to do a full Joker Man shirt."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"And even the fact now that we have confirmation"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"that it's named after the Dylan song"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"opens up a whole new world for us."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"I understand for you there maybe is not too much meaning,"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"but for us, that opens up a whole new universe."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"Wow, so what's going on in this universe, then?"
01:07:02;01:07:06;"Well, the fact that we've been so excited to cover this song"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"is to delve into the universe of Joker Man,"
01:07:08;01:07:13;"and the fact that there is a typeface with the same name,"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"there's some kind of synergy there,"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"and there's some type of wisdom in that song."
01:07:16;01:07:18;"And for me, like I said,"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"there's something about that song"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"that represents the duality of man."
01:07:21;01:07:23;"I've always been interested in that intersection"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"of lightheartedness and heaviness,"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"which I think the song has,"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"and the character Joker Man,"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"and the font."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"Wow."
01:07:31;01:07:32;"That's always been the place"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"that I've found the most fascinating."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"But anyway."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Have you spoken to Mr. Dylan about this, then?"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"We're going to have to get him on the next episode."
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Yeah."
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Do you have any information,"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"I mean, now that it's been 23 years of the font,"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"has anybody ever talked about the Dylan connection to you"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"and said, ""Oh, yeah, you know, actually, like, Bob,"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"has anything ever gotten back to you,"
01:07:48;01:07:51;"whether Bob knows about the font, anything like that?"""
01:07:51;01:07:52;"No, no."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"I mean, I haven't heard from Bob's people,"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"if he likes it or if he's seen it."
01:07:55;01:07:57;"I mean, it'd be nice to know."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"Look, there's not a lot that we can offer here on Time Crisis,"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"but one thing is,"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"we have a few connections in the music industry."
01:08:03;01:08:04;"So now that we have confirmation"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"that there is a connection between the font and the song,"
01:08:07;01:08:08;"I'm going to make it my mission"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"to see if I can get any real confirmation."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"That'd be great."
01:08:12;01:08:14;"I mean, if he could send me a little note or something,"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"just to, you know, that'd be brilliant."
01:08:16;01:08:18;"I'd like to think my image of Bob"
01:08:18;01:08:21;"is he's the type of guy who would appreciate it, you know?"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Yeah."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"He's coming over to the UK next year"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"with Neil Young to play in the summer."
01:08:26;01:08:27;"Oh, I saw that. Wow."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"So maybe I could meet him."
01:08:29;01:08:31;"You could pull some strings or something."
01:08:31;01:08:34;"Well, I know that he's pretty cagey about meeting people."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"I know."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"Because we actually played on the same stage as him"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"in Japan this summer."
01:08:38;01:08:39;"We played right after Bob Dylan,"
01:08:39;01:08:43;"not because the festival wanted us to headline over Bob,"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"but because he was like, ""I want to leave early."""
01:08:46;01:08:47;"Right."
01:08:47;01:08:48;"""You can swap me with whoever's playing before."""
01:08:48;01:08:49;"So then, all right."
01:08:49;01:08:52;"But so we watched him a little bit on the side of the stage,"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"but we were told very strictly, like..."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"No eye contact."
01:08:55;01:08:59;"No phones, even though he's on stage in front of 100,000 people."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"And they also said, ""If he walks past you, whatever,"
01:09:01;01:09:02;"just don't say anything."""
01:09:02;01:09:03;"Bow your head."
01:09:03;01:09:04;"Fair enough."
01:09:04;01:09:06;"It's Bob Dylan."
01:09:06;01:09:07;"He'd probably want to have a chat with you."
01:09:07;01:09:09;"Maybe his people don't let him."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"I don't know."
01:09:10;01:09:14;"I heard a story that when he was in the UK a while ago,"
01:09:14;01:09:17;"he went to Liverpool and did the bus tour,"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"the Beatle bus tour."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"Really? Just the tourist tour?"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"He was wearing a hat and a coat and stuff."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"A lot of people didn't recognize him."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"You know."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"[laughs]"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"See, that's what you want to hear about Bob Dylan."
01:09:28;01:09:32;"Just like, just checking out the Beatles bus tour, just low key."
01:09:32;01:09:33;"Yeah."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Well, anyway, Andrew, thanks so much for taking the time."
01:09:35;01:09:36;"We hope you'll call in again."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Well, thanks. It's great."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"You love the font so much,"
01:09:38;01:09:42;"and it's bringing a lot of joy and happiness to you."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"100%, and to a lot of other people as well."
01:09:44;01:09:45;"That's great."
01:09:45;01:09:46;"So thanks, Andrew. We appreciate it."
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Have a good one."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"Okay. Cheers, then."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Bye."

01:11:09;01:11:10;"This week on the top five."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Staying in the '90s, aren't we?"
01:11:12;01:11:13;"We're staying in the '90s."
01:11:13;01:11:15;"Yeah, we were getting bogged down in that late '70s,"
01:11:15;01:11:16;"early '80s vibe, man."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"I was sick of it."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Everyone was."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"'79, '81, always '80s."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"'77, all was terrible."
01:11:23;01:11:24;"Anyway, we want more of the '90s."
01:11:24;01:11:26;"The '90s are on trend."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"They're in fashion."
01:11:27;01:11:29;"Everything old is new again."
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Right."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"20-year cycle, whatever."
01:11:31;01:11:37;"And we picked 1995 as the year that we were going to compare to."
01:11:37;01:11:39;"Why did we pick 1995?"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"It's the year I graduated high school"
01:11:41;01:11:45;"and the year that Andrew Smith created the Joker Man font."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"That's right."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"Pomparog High School, Class of '95."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"What was your high school called?"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"Pomparog."
01:11:50;01:11:52;"It's like a Native American word?"
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Yeah."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Pomparog."
01:11:54;01:11:58;"P-O-M-P-E-R-A-U-G."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"Like the guest speaker at your graduation is like,"
01:12:01;01:12:06;"""To the Class of 1995, you're graduating into a brand new world."
01:12:06;01:12:11;"""The internet is connecting people in ways that couldn't have even been imagined"
01:12:11;01:12:14;"""when I graduated high school in 1959."
01:12:14;01:12:18;"""Andrew Smith recently unveiled a new font called Joker Man,"
01:12:18;01:12:22;"""changing the way that people think about the Bob Dylan song Joker Man."""
01:12:22;01:12:23;"And coffee shops."
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Worldwide."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"So yeah, '95 is the year that Joker Man dropped."
01:12:28;01:12:29;"You know, it's funny."
01:12:29;01:12:33;"I think the song Joker Man dropped in 1984, the year that I was born."
01:12:33;01:12:34;"Can I get a number crunch on that, Seinfeld?"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Really? That late? I thought it was earlier."
01:12:36;01:12:39;"It was recorded in 1983, released in 1984."
01:12:39;01:12:40;"You nailed it."
01:12:40;01:12:41;"Boom."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"You nailed it."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"1984, Joker Man drops."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"I had to wait another 11 years for the font."
01:12:46;01:12:50;"Anyway, the number five song--1995, I remember this [bleep] well"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"because I was 11 years old."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"I probably know it really well too."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"I remember this song was huge."
01:12:55;01:12:59;"This was a major song for my generation."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"This is the number five song in 1995, Coolio, Gangsta's Paradise featuring LV."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Oh, wow."
01:13:06;01:13:11;"So this song interpolates the Stevie Wonder song, Pastime Paradise."
01:13:11;01:13:14;"Off of the songs in the Key of Life album."
01:13:14;01:13:15;"That's right."
01:13:17;01:13:21;"I take a look at my life and realize there's nothing left."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Do you know every word of this song?"
01:13:23;01:13:26;"No, I have not heard this song in many, many years."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"Every time I hear this, I know almost every word."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"I think I had the CD single of this."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"I didn't have the--this was on the Dangerous Mind soundtrack."
01:13:34;01:13:35;"I didn't even know the whole soundtrack."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Sure, sure."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"But this is just--I don't know why."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"This song is so easy to learn and you just heard it so much."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"It's real slow."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Yeah, it's slow."
01:13:45;01:13:48;"I'm the kind of G that little homies want to be like."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"I'm on knees in the night singing prayers in the streetlight."
01:13:56;01:13:58;"You think Coolio double tracks his vocal?"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Does it sound double tracked?"
01:14:00;01:14:04;"I mean, a lot of rappers will do a second pass where they emphasize certain words."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"I feel like Tupac double tracked everything."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"Really?"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"This was actually reminding me of Tupac."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"It's kind of a Tupac flow."
01:14:12;01:14:13;"I never heard that before."
01:14:17;01:14:18;"That's definitely--"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"It does sound double tracked, yeah."
01:14:24;01:14:26;"Too much television."
01:14:26;01:14:27;"Seinfeld knows it."
01:14:27;01:14:28;"I know this whole thing."
01:14:53;01:15:03;"So blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me."
01:15:03;01:15:04;"It's a great song."
01:15:04;01:15:05;"Yep."
01:15:05;01:15:08;"It also makes you go back and realize how incredible Stevie Wonder is."
01:15:08;01:15:09;"I know."
01:15:09;01:15:10;"When you really go through all his--"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"What is the Stevie song?"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Pastime Paradise."
01:15:13;01:15:19;"Also, Stevie Wonder, his run of albums in the '70s is so unbelievable."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Secret Life of Plants, dude."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"That's a tight album."
01:15:27;01:15:28;"Track 8 on Songs on the Keylight."
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Also, just nothing sounds--"
01:15:30;01:15:32;"What was the reference for this song?"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Classic double album."
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Yeah, this is wild."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"Songs on the Keylight."
01:16:32;01:16:33;"Incredible."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"The number five song of 2018."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"Thank You, Next."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"We talked about this one last time."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"You remember this one, Jake?"
01:16:39;01:16:40;"No."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"This is the one where Ariana Grande--"
01:16:42;01:16:43;"Oh, right."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"--says she's thankful for her exes."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"And then she's thankful for herself?"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"That's right."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"That's the plot twist."
01:16:49;01:16:50;"Spoiler alert."
01:17:39;01:17:40;"Well, hold on."
01:17:40;01:17:42;"We've probably said everything we have to say about this song,"
01:17:42;01:17:46;"but you're telling me that we have a new song from Patrick World?"
01:17:46;01:17:50;"Yeah, he DM'd us late last night and just said,"
01:17:50;01:17:53;"""I gotta get one more in before the end of the year."""
01:17:53;01:17:55;"Well, he's completed his hat trick, 'cause we're playing it."
01:17:55;01:17:57;"Here's ""Thank You, Ez"" from Patrick World."
01:17:58;01:18:01;"Time Crisis."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"This is the Time Crisis."
01:18:03;01:18:04;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"Brought to you by Doritos."
01:18:07;01:18:08;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Ooh, nice falsetto."
01:18:46;01:18:47;"[laughter]"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"[laughter]"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Wow, he really crammed in the references on that one."
01:19:17;01:19:20;"Patrick is a very close listener of the show."
01:19:20;01:19:24;"Yeah, I wonder if the average TC head is catching all those references."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"Right, ""Welcome to My Life"" is kind of deep."
01:19:27;01:19:32;"I feel like the second fridge full of McRibs is definitely top five TC."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"Sure, that's classic."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Lonnie's dad is classic."
01:19:35;01:19:36;"Although, I do want a Quibble."
01:19:36;01:19:37;"What's that?"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"It's a freezer, not a fridge."
01:19:38;01:19:40;"Oh!"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"He said fridge, not a fridge."
01:19:42;01:19:43;"He said second fridge."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Second fridge."
01:19:45;01:19:46;"Patrick, your work's incredible."
01:19:46;01:19:49;"Although, you could make the case they were two slightly separate conversations"
01:19:49;01:19:53;"because Lonnie's dad had the freezer, but we did talk about it being a two-fridge household."
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Oh, right, having a two-fridge household."
01:19:54;01:19:56;"He kind of took two Time Crisis things and put them together."
01:19:56;01:20:01;"And I guess you could have the McRibs in the freezer portion of the second fridge."
01:20:01;01:20:02;"Yes."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"But I'm picturing more of a chest freezer."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"[laughter]"
01:20:05;01:20:06;"A chest freezer."
01:20:06;01:20:09;"Yeah, there's something very specific about a chest freezer, too."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Yeah, that's like a real hunter vibe."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"Yeah, it's very hunter."
01:20:12;01:20:15;"Got 80 pounds of venison in the chest freezer."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Yeah."
01:20:16;01:20:23;"The number four song this week in 1995, Mariah Carey, who actually is just putting out a new album now."
01:20:23;01:20:24;"Really?"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"Yeah."
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Man, Mariah Carey in the '90s."
01:20:26;01:20:27;"Peak."
01:20:27;01:20:28;"She was killing it."
01:20:28;01:20:29;"This is a fantasy."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Oh, wow."
01:20:30;01:20:31;"Classic."
01:20:31;01:20:32;"This is the one that--"
01:20:32;01:20:35;"This is another '70s sample."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Or '80s."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Yeah, '80s."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"[singing]"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"Yeah, Tom Tom Club."
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Oh, is that '80s?"
01:20:40;01:20:41;"It was very early '80s."
01:20:41;01:20:42;"[singing]"
01:20:42;01:21:00;"This might be one of the rare example where I actually like the updated version more than the original."
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Oh, you like this more than Tom Tom Club?"
01:21:02;01:21:03;"I do."
01:21:03;01:21:04;"Really?"
01:21:04;01:21:07;"I think the melodies are-- the melody that she writes over is really good."
01:21:07;01:21:27;"[singing]"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"In '95, I was not into this."
01:21:29;01:21:30;"Too busy listening to God Above Voices?"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Yeah, that kind of stuff."
01:21:31;01:21:35;"But I just-- hearing this later, years later, I was like, oh, this is a great song."
01:21:35;01:21:38;"It's so feel good, but it's not cheesy."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"Right, right."
01:21:39;01:21:56;"[singing]"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Mariah Carey rules."
01:21:58;01:21:59;"Yep."
01:21:59;01:22:06;"The number four song back in 2018 is An Old Friend."
01:22:06;01:22:10;"OK, so it is slowly slipping in the charts."
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Yeah, it is."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"But it is hanging tough."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"The first time we encountered this song, it was number one."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"And it was like that for a few episodes."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Yeah."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"[singing]"
01:22:20;01:22:25;"I'm going to read an email that we got from a guy named Charlie as we listen to this."
01:22:25;01:22:27;"[singing]"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Hi, guys."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"Firstly, love the show."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Keep rolling."
01:22:30;01:22:33;"I must admit I'm a TC head, not really into VW,"
01:22:33;01:22:37;"mainly because I didn't really have exposure to it before TC came along."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"Interesting."
01:22:38;01:22:40;"How the hell did you get into TC?"
01:22:40;01:22:41;"But that's interesting."
01:22:41;01:22:43;"Anyway, to the important question du jour."
01:22:43;01:22:47;"What is the maximum number of syllables you can make out of a word in a song?"
01:22:47;01:22:52;"Just listening to Chart with Brooke and Halsey stretched a few words to fit the music,"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"and then it was followed by shallow."
01:22:54;01:22:57;"In the sh-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-low."
01:22:57;01:23:00;"In the sh-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-low."
01:23:00;01:23:03;"Is that maximum number canon across universes?"
01:23:03;01:23:07;"So in the Acebo, is it the same as in the real universe?"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"He doesn't really like shallow."
01:23:08;01:23:11;"He goes on to say, ""For what it's worth, my feeling on the shallow songs,"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"that is just lazy songwriting."
01:23:13;01:23:17;"I could think of loads of lyrics that would fit the context of the song in the music phrasing."
01:23:17;01:23:20;"Anyway, interested in your thoughts on this musical parameter."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"Cheers, Charlie."""
01:23:21;01:23:25;"I mean, you know, Charlie, I don't do that that much in my songwriting,"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"but that's probably because I'm a coward."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"There's something really bold about just taking a word and just stretching it out."
01:23:30;01:23:31;"I respect it."
01:23:31;01:23:34;"I'm trying to think of other iconic examples."
01:23:34;01:23:38;"In all the good times I find myself"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Kind of drawing a blank. It's hard to think with the music."
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Going for a change"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"And in the bad times I fear myself"
01:23:49;01:23:52;"I'm on the deep end"
01:23:52;01:23:58;"I'll never meet the ground"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"Crash through the sand"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"The lyrics are kind of awkward in this song."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Whoa."
01:24:03;01:24:06;"This is like when you're like, ""Are you tired of this modern world?"""
01:24:06;01:24:08;"This is like, that's a little stock."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"That's my favorite, though."
01:24:09;01:24:12;"Or like, ""Is it hard keeping it so hardcore?"""
01:24:12;01:24:15;"I just find that awkward."
01:24:15;01:24:17;"The one thing I'll say, I love this song."
01:24:17;01:24:18;"Yeah, I'm in."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"I root for it."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"I listen to it every morning and every night."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"You're doing your push-ups and your chin-ups."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"Jake, to your point, though,"
01:24:26;01:24:30;"is Jackson Maine in the Isibu supposed to be a great songwriter?"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Yeah."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"Eh, who knows?"
01:24:33;01:24:35;"One day we got to get B-Koops on this show."
01:24:35;01:24:38;"And it'll be like, ""You know, when I created the character Jackson Maine,"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"I thought he'd be a decent guy,"
01:24:40;01:24:45;"probably the type of guy that a Guided by Voices fan would not respect."""
01:24:45;01:24:47;"That was on my mood board."
01:24:47;01:24:50;"Part of my mood board, ""What does this fan look like?"
01:24:50;01:24:51;"What does the hater look like?"""
01:24:51;01:24:55;"And I had a picture of Jake, American Painter radio personality."
01:24:55;01:24:58;"The one thing I'll question, just from a meaning point of view,"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"is that the chorus is there saying,"
01:25:00;01:25:03;"""I'm going to dive in, and I'm in the deep end"" or some s--t, right?"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"Yeah."
01:25:04;01:25:07;"""I'm in the deep end,"" implying that things are getting tough, right?"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"We're like, we could drown, you know, or things are heavy."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"And then she goes, ""We're far from the shallow now."""
01:25:13;01:25:14;"And then together they sing,"

01:27:10;01:27:11;"Like, they're going back and forth."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"They're in the shallow, they're in the deep end,"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"then they're back in the shallow, and then they're at the very end--"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"the last phrase is, ""Then they're out of the shallow."""
01:27:18;01:27:21;"Nothing about the song implies that they went back to the shallow."
01:27:21;01:27:22;"Well, except for saying it."
01:27:22;01:27:23;"It's not canon that they went--"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"No, but they don't say, ""Then we went back to the shallow."""
01:27:25;01:27:26;"They say, ""In the shallow."""
01:27:26;01:27:29;"I'm just saying the rest of the song, you could almost tell it's a story."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"In fact, the story might be a star is born."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"A guy meets a girl,"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"and he can tell that there's an emptiness in her life."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"There's something she doesn't like about the modern world."
01:27:38;01:27:41;"He can tell it's almost like her life is too plain."
01:27:41;01:27:45;"But on the flip side, she looks at him, and she says, ""Okay, I get it."
01:27:45;01:27:47;"""You don't like the modern world, and you're telling me"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"""I should be fed up with the modern world,"

01:27:51;01:27:52;"""Doesn't that get tiring, too?"""
01:27:52;01:27:53;"Sounds pretty hard."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"Yeah."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"Isn't it hard to keep it so hardcore?"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Okay, maybe we're actually two sides of the same coin,"
01:27:58;01:28:00;"where two people have different forms of dissatisfaction."
01:28:00;01:28:03;"I mean, you're mining the dregs of this dying art form."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"Yeah."
01:28:04;01:28:07;"You're trying to be a rocker, and I'm trying to be a--whatever."
01:28:07;01:28:11;"But at the same time, the grass is always greener, or whatever."
01:28:11;01:28:15;"But one thing that we have in common is that we're falling in love,"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"and that our life is getting crazy."
01:28:18;01:28:19;"So we're diving in."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"""You Got Your Issues, I Got My Issues."""
01:28:21;01:28:24;"That's also a classic, especially modern song thing."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"There's a song called ""Issues."""
01:28:25;01:28:27;"""I Got Issues, You Got 'Em, Too."""
01:28:27;01:28:28;"That's basically what the song is."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"It's a different version of ""Issues"" by Julia Michaels."
01:28:31;01:28:34;"""You got your issues, man. I got my issues."
01:28:34;01:28:35;"""But you know what?"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"""We got to explore the serious chemistry between us,"

01:28:48;01:28:49;"What?"
01:28:49;01:28:50;"You know, it's confusing."
01:28:50;01:28:51;"Okay."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"I still love the song, though."
01:28:53;01:28:57;"The number three song in 1995 was LL Cool J featuring Boyz II Men."
01:28:57;01:28:58;"""Hey, Lover."""
01:28:58;01:29:03;"LL Cool J, a long history of slow jams."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"Not sure I know this one."
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Features a sample from Michael Jackson's ""The Lady in My Life."""
01:29:08;01:29:10;"I never had somebody."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"This is love."
01:29:13;01:29:16;"This is more than a crush."
01:29:16;01:29:21;"It was Harlem at the Bruckers"
01:29:21;01:29:23;"I saw you with your man, smiling"
01:29:23;01:29:25;"A coach bag in your hand"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"I was laying in the coop with my hat turned back"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"We caught eyes for a moment"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"And that was that"
01:29:30;01:29:31;"So we skated off"
01:29:31;01:29:34;"LL Cool J always stealing people's girlfriends"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"Long-time theme of his music"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"I gotta take it from your man, that's my mission"
01:29:38;01:29:41;"If his lover's really got the hand of competition"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"You're only new in five months"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"That's right"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"Besides, he drink too much"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"And smoke too many blunts"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"And I be working out every day"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Thinking 'bout you"
01:29:49;01:29:52;"Looking at my own eyes in the rearview"
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Catching flashbacks of our eye contact"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"Wish I could be with you"
01:29:55;01:29:57;"I used to have this LL Cool J tape"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"I very briefly had a car"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"The only time in my life that I had, like, my car"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"Was I had my parents' old car for, like, six months"
01:30:04;01:30:05;"When I was a senior in high school"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Uh-huh"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"The Toyota Alltrack"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"It was pretty f***ed up"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"But they let me drive it around town"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"And it had a cassette deck"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"Which even at the time was already"
01:30:15;01:30:17;"An archaic form of technology"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"But I would go buy random tapes at Goodwill or whatever"
01:30:20;01:30:22;"And I had this LL Cool J tape"
01:30:22;01:30:24;"It was a very minor single from him"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"It wasn't one of the big hits from the '80s"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"Called ""I'm That Type of Guy"""
01:30:27;01:30:30;"And in this one, too, he sounds like he's talking to the girl"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"But then he also starts talking to the guy"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"These are some of the lines I remember from it"
01:30:33;01:30:37;"You're the type of guy who acts all suspicious"
01:30:37;01:30:41;"I'm the type of guy who says pudding is delicious"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Which I always thought was kind of strange"
01:30:42;01:30:48;"Talk about nonsensical, completely illogical lyrics, man"
01:30:48;01:30:51;"You're the type of guy that can't control your girl"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls"
01:30:54;01:30:57;"I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene"
01:30:57;01:30:59;"And gets the seven digits"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"You know the routine"
01:31:00;01:31:03;"You're the type of guy that tells her stay inside"
01:31:03;01:31:06;"While you steady frontin' in your homeboy's ride"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"I'm doing your girlfriend"
01:31:10;01:31:12;"That's something you can't believe"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"'Cause I'm that type of guy"
01:31:14;01:31:15;"And then it's the chorus"
01:31:15;01:31:16;"That's also-- I love--"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"That's so weak"
01:31:17;01:31:18;"I forgot about the line"
01:31:18;01:31:20;"But I was like, at first, he's kind of being sneaky about it"
01:31:20;01:31:23;"Just like saying, ""You're this kind of guy, I'm this type of guy"""
01:31:23;01:31:24;"And then just straight up"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave"
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I'm doing your girlfriend"
01:31:28;01:31:31;"It's like, man, you gotta make a whole song addressed--"
01:31:31;01:31:35;"I get it, you and this girl have undeniable sexual chemistry"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"I won't begrudge you that"
01:31:37;01:31:40;"But why'd you have to make a whole song addressed to me?"
01:31:40;01:31:42;"Oh, this was also a really mean line in it"
01:31:42;01:31:45;"You're the type of guy to give her money to shop"
01:31:45;01:31:47;"She gave me a sweater"
01:31:47;01:31:49;"Thank you, sweetheart"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"That's just mean"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"So, Jake, imagine this"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"You're a married man"
01:31:54;01:31:57;"Imagine that you gave your wife some money to go shopping"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Oh, my God"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"You gave her a few hundred bucks rolled up"
01:32:01;01:32:02;"And you say, ""Hey"""
01:32:02;01:32:04;"JCPenney's having a sale"
01:32:04;01:32:05;"[laughter]"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"JCPenney's having a sale"
01:32:07;01:32:08;"""Hey, this one's on me"""
01:32:08;01:32:09;"Clearance"
01:32:09;01:32:12;"""This money, I'm just doing something nice for you"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"Go shopping"""
01:32:13;01:32:15;"And then LL Cool J comes back"
01:32:15;01:32:18;"Wearing a brand new sweater from JCPenney's and says"
01:32:18;01:32:21;"""Hey, Jake, your wife just bought me this. Thanks"""
01:32:21;01:32:22;"What?"
01:32:22;01:32:24;"That wouldn't feel good"
01:32:24;01:32:25;"LL?"
01:32:25;01:32:26;"[laughter]"
01:32:26;01:32:28;"LL Cool J"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"Why would she buy you that sweater?"
01:32:30;01:32:32;"And then he just looks you dead in the eyes and says"
01:32:32;01:32:33;"""'Cause I'm doing her"""
01:32:33;01:32:36;"On the porch of her small house"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"[laughter]"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"""I'm doing your girlfriend"""
01:32:39;01:32:41;"That's something you can't believe"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"That song has fascinated me for over a decade"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Unsurprisingly"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Yeah, that's a crazy song"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"I also love the fact that we haven't even played it"
01:32:49;01:32:51;"But unsurprisingly, that, as opposed to ""Hey Love"""
01:32:51;01:32:53;"or featuring Boyz II Men"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"""I'm That Type of Guy"" was not particularly a hit"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"for LL Cool J"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"That was actually kind of a commercial low point for him"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"This is not the song that's in the top 5?"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"No, I'm saying that it made me think of an LL Cool"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"I don't know this song that well"
01:33:03;01:33:05;"No, this is a song from the late 80s"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"'Cause, you know, he came out and he was really big"
01:33:07;01:33:09;"And then he had kind of like this awkward run of albums"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"that didn't do that well"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"And then he came back with ""Mama Said Knock You Out"""
01:33:12;01:33:13;"Is that this era?"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"This was kind of the contifter"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"Right after ""Mama Said""?"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"""Mama Said Knock You Out"" was like '91 or something"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"Oh, that era?"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"So he came out in the mid-80s"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"Right"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"The Rick Rubin production, he's changing culture"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"Awkwardness in the late 80s"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Then burst back into the 90s"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"""Mama Said Knock You Out"""
01:33:28;01:33:31;"Then had a really cool run through this album"
01:33:31;01:33:34;"Anyway, we should try to get LL on to ask him about that song"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"He'd be like, ""Pfft, there's no theory, guys"""
01:33:36;01:33:37;"Yeah, it would kind of be like that"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Like me reading deep into ""Joker"", man"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Be like, ""Oh, what's the story?"""
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Uh, yeah"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"This is a song about late capitalism"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"I love those lyrics during lunch, man"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"But why would you address the guy?"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"It's just a song, man"
01:33:50;01:33:51;"I was doing his girlfriend"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"What do you want from me?"
01:33:53;01:33:55;"The record company asked me for a new single"
01:33:55;01:33:56;"Doing is such a..."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"I was doing this guy's girlfriend"
01:33:58;01:34:00;"Raw term"
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Write what you know"
01:34:01;01:34:03;"I haven't heard that since middle school"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"It was also that euphemism for sex"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"Do?"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"Yeah"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"And actually, LL, later on in the 90s"
01:34:09;01:34:10;"He famously had the song"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"""Doin' it, doin' it, doin' it"""
01:34:12;01:34:13;"Oh, yeah"
01:34:13;01:34:14;"That was a good song"
01:34:14;01:34:15;"It's in the word ""do"""
01:34:15;01:34:18;"And actually, ""doin' it"" goes down a lot easier than"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"""I'm doin' your girlfriend"""
01:34:20;01:34:22;"And also, the phrasing is so weird"
01:34:22;01:34:23;"""I'm doin' your girlfriend"""
01:34:23;01:34:25;"That's something you can't believe"
01:34:25;01:34:26;"[laughs]"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"LL, I can't believe it"
01:34:28;01:34:29;"Anyway"
01:34:29;01:34:32;"The number three song in 2018 is"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Panic! At The Disco - High Hopes"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"These guys are crushing it right now"
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Panic! At The Disco"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"I'm doin' your girlfriend"
01:35:10;01:35:13;"I like this song more and more every time I hear it"
01:35:13;01:35:14;"I'm getting pretty amped now"
01:35:14;01:35:15;"I'm down"
01:35:52;01:35:55;"It's no surprise that that song was featured in an EA Sports"
01:35:55;01:35:59;"video game, NHL '19, as well as during the NHL's promotional campaign"
01:35:59;01:36:02;"for the 2018 Stanley Cup Final"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"That is deep"
01:36:03;01:36:06;"If I was an athlete, I'd make that my walk-on"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"Maybe Vampire Weekend should walk out to that song"
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Yeah"
01:36:09;01:36:13;"I've always liked these kind of pump-up songs with chopped up horns"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"We used to walk out to this Drake song"
01:36:20;01:36:21;"This is cool"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"You know, like, the big brass, it has kind of like a"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Regal"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"A regal/athletic connotation"
01:36:38;01:36:39;"That's a classic line, too"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"""I do not stay at the Intercontinental"""
01:36:41;01:36:44;"And Intercontinentals are not garbage"
01:36:44;01:36:47;"In Toronto, the Intercontinental is like a three-star"
01:36:47;01:36:48;"Oh, really?"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"Yeah, just weirdly, just not one city"
01:36:50;01:36:54;"That's true, different cities sometimes, like, yeah, like the four seasons in one city"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"is like this incredible hotel in another"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"It's not, that's the power of branding"
01:36:58;01:37:02;"Do you ever worry that the walk-on song is gonna, like, upstage you?"
01:37:02;01:37:04;"Like, you think about what you're opening with"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"Oh, yeah, big time"
01:37:05;01:37:09;"In fact, that's why maybe the Panic! at the Disco song is a bad idea"
01:37:09;01:37:13;"'Cause, you know, Vampire Weekend, we're considered a rock or an indie rock band"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"Yeah"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"We come out to a Drake song"
01:37:15;01:37:19;"Well, people already know they're not seeing a high-energy rap show"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"from one of the biggest Canadian rappers of all time"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"So it's kind of like, ""Okay, Drake, alright, now I'm ready to"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"back to what I expected"""
01:37:24;01:37:25;"Right"
01:37:25;01:37:29;"So if we come out to a Panic! at the Disco song, that's one of the biggest bands in America"
01:37:29;01:37:32;"And now people are starting to think, ""Why am I not singing Panic! at the Disco?"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"Why am I singing Vampire Weekend?"""
01:37:34;01:37:35;"They're both bands"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"Panic! at the Disco, their songs are arguably more exciting"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Maybe I'm just, like, setting myself up"
01:37:40;01:37:44;"I guess you have to open with something that's, like, similar tempo?"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"'Cause that Panic! at the Disco song is fast"
01:37:46;01:37:47;"It's fast, yeah, maybe that's the thing"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"So maybe if you open with, like, a slow song, it'd be kind of weird, right?"
01:37:50;01:37:53;"I think when we played Australia last summer, we walked out to Back in Black"
01:37:53;01:37:54;"Okay"
01:37:54;01:37:55;"As kind of a nod to the country"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"That's slow"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"And everybody in the crowd just went like, ""Dah! Dah-dah-dah!"""
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Yeah"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"That went pretty well"
01:38:01;01:38:06;"The number two song in 1995, Whitney Houston, from the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack"
01:38:06;01:38:08;"Exhale, ""Shoop Shoop"""
01:38:08;01:38:13;"Everyone falls in love sometimes"
01:38:13;01:38:15;"I don't think I know this one either"
01:38:15;01:38:22;"Sometimes it's wrong and sometimes it's right"
01:38:22;01:38:29;"For every win, someone must fail"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"But there comes a rain"
01:38:30;01:38:33;"This song's written and produced by Babyface"
01:38:33;01:38:34;"He's killing it in the 90s"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"Yeah"
01:38:36;01:38:45;"Say, ""Shoop, Shoop, Shoop, Shoop-a-doop-doop, Shoop-a-doop-doop"""
01:38:45;01:38:46;"Remember this part?"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"No, I didn't remember"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"It just reminds me of the Salt-N-Pepa"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"Oh, yeah, yeah"
01:38:52;01:38:55;"Shoop, Shoop, Shoop-a-doop"
01:38:58;01:38:59;"My love"
01:38:59;01:39:03;"Shoop, Shoop, Shoop-a-doop"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"Sometimes it's right"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"It's an interesting chorus"
01:39:07;01:39:11;"This is what Babyface had to say about the song"
01:39:11;01:39:14;"When Whitney first heard the song, she'd figured, ""I just lost it"""
01:39:14;01:39:16;"""I couldn't come up with words anymore"""
01:39:16;01:39:17;"And actually, she's right"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"I couldn't think of anything for that particular part"
01:39:20;01:39:21;"It felt like it should groove there"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals"
01:39:23;01:39:24;"So I started humming along with it"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"And that's what happened, the shoops came"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"But they felt so good, I thought, ""Why not?"""
01:39:28;01:39:29;"It doesn't have to mean anything"
01:39:29;01:39:30;"Oh, that's a good--"
01:39:30;01:39:32;"That kind of ties in with what we were saying before"
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Good theme for the show"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"Maybe they should have just said ""shoop"" instead of ""in the shallows"""
01:39:36;01:39:39;"Shoop, Shoop, Shoop-a-doop"
01:39:39;01:39:43;"I think it's okay when part of a song doesn't totally make sense"
01:39:43;01:39:45;"It's interesting to talk about, but it's okay"
01:39:45;01:39:47;"Because that's just like life, man"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"It's dream logic, man"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"It's dream logic"
01:39:50;01:39:53;"And also just like life, you know, you got a plan for the day"
01:39:53;01:39:57;"We're gonna grab some burgers on our way to the beach or whatever"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Cool plan"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"Jake's in"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"Very on board with this plan"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"And it doesn't always work out that way"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"The number two song back in 2018"
01:40:07;01:40:13;"Halsey, one of the only people who exists in the, uh, stew"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"And the Acebo"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"This is her song ""Without Me"""
01:40:17;01:40:20;"Cool tone"
01:40:20;01:40:22;"I was about to say that is a cool tone"
01:40:22;01:40:30;"The track is a breakup song"
01:40:30;01:40:34;"Found you when your heart was broke"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"I filled you up until it overflowed"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"Took it so far to keep you close"
01:40:41;01:40:44;"I was afraid to leave you on your own"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"I said I'd catch you if you fall"
01:40:47;01:40:51;"And if they laugh at me more"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"And then I'd crash you off your knees"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Put you right back on your feet"
01:40:55;01:40:58;"Just so you could take advantage of me"
01:40:58;01:41:01;"Tell me how's it feel sitting up there"
01:41:01;01:41:05;"Feeling so high but too far away to hold me"
01:41:05;01:41:08;"You know I'm the one who put you up there"
01:41:08;01:41:12;"Day and night the sky doesn't ever get lonely"
01:41:12;01:41:15;"Thinking you could live without me"
01:41:15;01:41:19;"Thinking you could live without me"
01:41:19;01:41:22;"Baby I'm the one who put you up there"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"Cause you don't know why"
01:41:26;01:41:30;"Thinking you could live without me"
01:41:30;01:41:33;"Live without me"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"This song has interesting production"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Very tasteful"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"I don't know why"
01:41:38;01:41:43;"I like it and I always root for Halsey"
01:41:43;01:41:44;"Great"
01:41:44;01:41:45;"You know why?"
01:41:45;01:41:46;"Jersey"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"She's a Jersey girl"
01:41:48;01:41:51;"Not from Connecticut"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"Yeah, there's no way she'd have a career"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"If she was from CT"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Oh here come the angry letters"
01:41:58;01:41:59;"Let's face it man"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Here come the angry letters"
01:42:00;01:42:02;"I mean, look"
01:42:02;01:42:05;"She's coming out of Hamden? That's not gonna work"
01:42:05;01:42:08;"The tri-state area is composed of three states"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"New Jersey"
01:42:09;01:42:11;"New York and Connecticut"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"New Jersey has Halsey"
01:42:13;01:42:15;"Isn't Bebe Rexha from New York?"
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Seinfeld?"
01:42:16;01:42:17;"I think she is"
01:42:17;01:42:18;"Let's get a number crunch on that"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"Bebe Rexha, Brooklyn, New York City"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"Brooklyn!"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"USA"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Cardi"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"Cardi B from the Bronx"
01:42:26;01:42:29;"Who of this modern class of pop stars is from Connecticut?"
01:42:29;01:42:30;"John Mayer"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"I respect him but he's not a modern pop star"
01:42:32;01:42:34;"Michael Bolton"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"No, I mean we're drawing a blank here"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"This has been somebody under 30"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"A running theme on the show"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"It's a real problem"
01:42:43;01:42:47;"I mean we gotta talk to some of the big wigs out there in Connecticut"
01:42:47;01:42:50;"Maybe we gotta get on the horn to Senator Richard Blumenthal"
01:42:50;01:42:51;"Or Senator Chris Murphy"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"I love that there's Chris Murphy"
01:42:53;01:42:54;"Between the two of us"
01:42:54;01:42:56;"We just pulled the two Connecticut senators"
01:42:56;01:42:57;"That's pretty rare"
01:42:57;01:42:59;"I don't know if we could do that with too many states"
01:42:59;01:43:04;"But Seinfeld, Canada was always known for paying out some pretty big bucks"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"To promote Canadian culture"
01:43:06;01:43:10;"Like Canada bankrolled a lot of these Canadian bands' early tours"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"Yeah, there's the whole CanCon thing"
01:43:12;01:43:13;"What's CanCon?"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"So CanCon is"
01:43:15;01:43:16;"Canadian content"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Canadian content, yes"
01:43:18;01:43:21;"It's a requirement from the law of Canada"
01:43:21;01:43:28;"That a certain percentage of all art, music, film, television consumed"
01:43:28;01:43:32;"Has to be written, shot, produced in Canada"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"I think it's 20% or something"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Modest, but respectable"
01:43:36;01:43:39;"But also the Canadian government gives money"
01:43:39;01:43:41;"To promote Canadian art abroad, right?"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"That sounds correct"
01:43:43;01:43:46;"The Canadian content system is called MAPL"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Maple, that's cute"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"To qualify as Canadian content"
01:43:50;01:43:54;"A musical selection must generally fulfill at least two of the following conditions"
01:43:54;01:43:55;"M, music"
01:43:55;01:43:57;"The music is composed entirely by a Canadian"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"A, artist"
01:43:58;01:44:02;"The music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian"
01:44:02;01:44:06;"So maybe if a Canadian pop star is singing three quarters"
01:44:06;01:44:09;"And then, you know, G-Eazy drops a verse"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"Well, okay, he's not Canadian"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"But principally it was performed by a Canadian"
01:44:12;01:44:13;"P, performance"
01:44:13;01:44:16;"A musical selection consists of a performance"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"That is recorded wholly in Canada or performed wholly in Canada"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"And broadcast live in Canada"
01:44:21;01:44:22;"L, lyrics"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"The lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian"
01:44:24;01:44:27;"Clearly, Connecticut needs a CONCON standard"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"Connecticut content"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"They need to give grants to Connecticut artists"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"To help them punch above their weight"
01:44:33;01:44:35;"Where's the Connecticut Halsey?"
01:44:35;01:44:39;"For too long, Connecticut has languished in the shadows"
01:44:39;01:44:42;"Cast by our big brothers"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"Or one big brother and one middle brother"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"New York and New Jersey"
01:44:46;01:44:49;"Would you say that Connecticut is the Canada of America?"
01:44:49;01:44:51;"Would that be a fair assessment?"
01:44:51;01:44:54;"I don't think any-- no, but I'll roll with it"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"I'll roll with it for no good reason"
01:44:56;01:44:59;"Yeah, sure, Connecticut is the Canada of America"
01:44:59;01:45:04;"CTTC heads are just banging their head against the wall right now"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"I know, we're gonna get another email just like"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"You know what, Jake?"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"There are so many great bands"
01:45:09;01:45:10;"As a self-hating--"
01:45:10;01:45:13;"Okay, but we have talked-- look, I love Connecticut the state"
01:45:13;01:45:15;"Jake's hard on it 'cause he's from there"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"We're not talking about quality"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"I'm actually being sympathetic to Connecticut"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"We're talking about visibility"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"When I say it's the Canada of America"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"I don't mean that as an insult either"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Oh yeah, you're from Canada"
01:45:26;01:45:27;"You respect it"
01:45:27;01:45:28;"No, I love Canada"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"Canada's a f***ing cool country"
01:45:30;01:45:34;"The difference between-- Canada has a very nice veneer"
01:45:34;01:45:38;"But then when you look under the hood of this nice laid-back country"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"You see some f***ing heavy hitters"
01:45:40;01:45:46;"You got Celine Dion, Drake, Alanis Morissette, Shania Twain, Avril Lavigne, Nickelback"
01:45:46;01:45:47;"Neil Young"
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Neil motherf***ing Young"
01:45:49;01:45:50;"Neil Peart"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Yeah, CT is definitely not the--"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"Kids in the hall"
01:45:52;01:45:53;"Canada of the US"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Mike Myers"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"Jim Carrey"
01:45:56;01:45:57;"Jim Carrey"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"John Candy, rest in peace"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Oh man, I love John-- wait, John Candy was Canadian?"
01:46:00;01:46:01;"He was"
01:46:01;01:46:02;"Right, right, he's amazing"
01:46:02;01:46:03;"Love John Candy"
01:46:03;01:46:06;"Anyway, let's get Connecticut poppin'"
01:46:06;01:46:09;"Let's get Connecticut poppin'"
01:46:09;01:46:14;"We should fly Halsey to Connecticut to do a workshop"
01:46:14;01:46:17;"We should fly her there"
01:46:17;01:46:19;"The premise is already--"
01:46:19;01:46:23;"That's a classic flight, that Newark to Hartford flight"
01:46:23;01:46:26;"No, Halsey's a big star, we're gonna get her a chopper"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"Regional flight"
01:46:28;01:46:31;"We're gonna get her a really nice helicopter, she's gonna beat the traffic"
01:46:31;01:46:36;"Gonna drop her at a local high school, you know, some municipal building in Hartford"
01:46:36;01:46:40;"And we're gonna get her, Bebe Rexha, Cardi B"
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I feel like this is a great reality show"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Connecticut Idol"
01:46:44;01:46:51;"The judges are Cardi B, Halsey, and Jake"
01:46:51;01:46:52;"Me"
01:46:52;01:46:53;"Yeah, Jake's the--"
01:46:53;01:46:54;"Well maybe John Mayer too"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Oh, and John Mayer, that's pretty tight"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"And Michael Bolton"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"We need five"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"It could be like the Ryan Seacrest"
01:47:01;01:47:02;"Right, right"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"'Cause of your hosting background"
01:47:04;01:47:05;"Right"
01:47:05;01:47:07;"Jake's side stage with like a microphone"
01:47:07;01:47:10;"So your girlfriend wants to be a pop star"
01:47:10;01:47:14;"And read the charts out of Maybach"
01:47:14;01:47:18;"She wants to move a million units, man"
01:47:18;01:47:22;"Probably just to prove she can"
01:47:22;01:47:25;"And after a couple of hits"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"She'll be buying a new pair of boots"
01:47:28;01:47:31;"And you can see just where she's heading"
01:47:31;01:47:34;"She's as predictable as I'm a-getting"
01:47:34;01:47:39;"Don't make 'em like they used to"
01:47:39;01:47:42;"Don't make 'em like they used to"
01:47:42;01:47:47;"Don't make 'em like they used to"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"You shoulda just stuck with me"
01:47:49;01:47:52;"First of all, Connecticut is so starved for a pop star"
01:47:52;01:47:57;"That even if we can't break the pop star nationally"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"We'll just be cleaning up in Connecticut"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Yeah"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"And also maybe a little bit of Rhode Island too"
01:48:02;01:48:05;"Yeah, I'd like if it was just like not only pop stars too"
01:48:05;01:48:08;"Just like general like CT talent"
01:48:08;01:48:11;"Just like this heavy metal band"
01:48:11;01:48:13;"God Murder"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"Will be performing their song"
01:48:16;01:48:17;"Connecticut hardcore"
01:48:17;01:48:18;"Yeah, man"
01:48:18;01:48:21;"Wait, Seinfeld, what's the population in Connecticut?"
01:48:21;01:48:22;"Can I get a number crunch?"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Hold on, let me guess"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"Oh yeah, let's let Jake guess"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"Five million"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"You wanna take a guess?"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"I think that's a good guess"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"I'll undercut Jake, I'll say 4.2"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"3.5"
01:48:33;01:48:34;"Oh wow, that's small"
01:48:34;01:48:35;"3,588,000"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"This makes a little more sense though"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"'Cause I bet Jersey is like"
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Six or seven"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Yeah, like double the size of CT"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"And obviously New York is like probably"
01:48:43;01:48:44;"Oh, New York's massive"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"15 million"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"That's a good point, yeah, New York City alone is eight, right?"
01:48:47;01:48:49;"Well then"
01:48:49;01:48:51;"Yeah, I bet New York State is like"
01:48:51;01:48:52;"16"
01:48:52;01:48:53;"I was gonna say like 10 or 12 outside of"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"No, no, no, it's like"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"I think it's like the population of the city"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"equals the whole rest of the state, something like that"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"How big is New Jersey?"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Okay, New York's population is eight million"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"New York City"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"New York City"
01:49:05;01:49:06;"New York State"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"Oh, you want the state?"
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Yeah"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"I'm gonna say like"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"I'm gonna say 16"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"I'm gonna say like 12"
01:49:11;01:49:13;"Guys, this show rules"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"This is so"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"Just guessing"
01:49:17;01:49:20;"New York State population, 19.8 million"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Okay, you nailed it, dude"
01:49:21;01:49:22;"It's a big boy"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"I'm surprised by that, wow"
01:49:24;01:49:25;"Man, you're forgetting about it"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"We got Buffalo, Troy, Syracuse"
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Those are all under a million"
01:49:29;01:49:30;"I mean"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Schenectady"
01:49:31;01:49:32;"Plattsburgh"
01:49:33;01:49:34;"Nyack"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"You got all Long Island"
01:49:35;01:49:37;"What's Buffalo, like 200,000?"
01:49:37;01:49:39;"Okay, now this is getting too cheap"
01:49:39;01:49:41;"This is completely"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"Just terrible radio"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"Okay, look"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"Okay, but the important thing"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Connecticut, 3.5"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"New York State"
01:49:50;01:49:55;"I was like, Howard, what's the population of Buffalo?"
01:49:55;01:49:57;"Okay, but what's the population of New Jersey?"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Saratoga Springs"
01:49:59;01:50:03;"New Jersey's population is 9,032,000"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"So Connecticut, you're right"
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Is at a serious disadvantage"
01:50:05;01:50:06;"Yeah"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"In terms of number of people"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"Yeah"
01:50:08;01:50:11;"So I think it's cool to help create a Connecticut pop star"
01:50:11;01:50:13;"And be like, you know what?"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"The world's turned its back on Connecticut for so long"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"That we're not even gonna try"
01:50:17;01:50:20;"To break the pop star nationally"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"This pop star, we're gonna tour the sh*t out of Connecticut"
01:50:23;01:50:24;"Regional"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"We're gonna hit all four corners of Connecticut"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"We're gonna hit the north, south, east, and west"
01:50:28;01:50:30;"And we'll tack on Rhode Island, 'cause it's small"
01:50:30;01:50:34;"But this is a Connecticut, Rhode Island-based act"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"And we're gonna take some of the valuable lessons"
01:50:36;01:50:40;"From our mentors like Halsey and Cardi B and Michael Bolton"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"But first things first"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"You gotta keep your side of the street clean"
01:50:44;01:50:45;"You gotta make your bed"
01:50:45;01:50:46;"I dig it"
01:50:46;01:50:47;"Okay, Connecticut Idol"
01:50:47;01:50:49;"Are we doing this?"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"Maybe we gotta do a roundup"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"The next episode's the last episode of the year"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"We gotta do a roundup of all of our best ideas"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"And see which ones we wanna do"
01:50:55;01:50:57;"'Cause actually there's one I haven't stopped"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"I know we joke about how we come up with a lot of"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Get-rich-quick schemes on this show"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"And we rarely follow through with them"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"There's one I've still been thinking about"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"And it's the Frosted Flakes one"
01:51:06;01:51:10;"Oh, I thought you were gonna say the Russian novel"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Based on the '90s sitcom universe"
01:51:12;01:51:13;"Oh, yeah"
01:51:13;01:51:14;"I forgot about that one"
01:51:14;01:51:16;"But the Frosted Flakes one, that's great"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"That's great"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"We'll talk about it more next week"
01:51:18;01:51:19;"But here's my idea"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"We know that we can call our own cereal Frosted Flakes"
01:51:21;01:51:24;"Because that's not a copyrightable phrase"
01:51:24;01:51:27;"So right there we got a name that everybody knows"
01:51:27;01:51:28;"And loves, Frosted Flakes"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Next step, we just need a cover"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"So we'll go buy some dog sh*t"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Generic Frosted Flakes"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"We don't need to worry about making it"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"Western Family"
01:51:37;01:51:39;"We'll repackage it"
01:51:39;01:51:40;"Rebox it"
01:51:40;01:51:41;"As Frosted Flakes"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Well, next thing we need is a cover"
01:51:43;01:51:45;"And I've been thinking about this"
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Okay, well, we have an iconic name"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"We need an iconic cover"
01:51:48;01:51:51;"Okay, well, you know, we can't get Tony the Tiger"
01:51:51;01:51:55;"And we can't afford to get some, you know, famous spokesperson"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"But hold on a second"
01:51:57;01:52:01;"How many iconic works of art are in the public domain?"
01:52:01;01:52:02;"Because they're old as hell"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"A lot"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"I was thinking about this"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"This is the first one that popped into my mind"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"We make our own Frosted Flakes"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"It says ""Frosted Flakes"" on the box"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"And then the picture is like"
01:52:11;01:52:14;"That Goya painting, Saturn eating his"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Okay"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"You know, just kooky"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"I'm thinking straight up Mona Lisa"
01:52:19;01:52:20;"Maybe straight up"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"I think that's better"
01:52:21;01:52:22;"I agree"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Okay"
01:52:23;01:52:24;"Or dude, Sistine Chapel"
01:52:24;01:52:27;"God's finger touching man's finger"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"I'm into it"
01:52:28;01:52:29;"So dumb"
01:52:29;01:52:31;"Maybe those are our two"
01:52:31;01:52:32;"Mona Lisa and that"
01:52:32;01:52:33;"And just like"
01:52:33;01:52:34;"How about this"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"I like Mona Lisa the best because the name is more iconic"
01:52:36;01:52:37;"Yeah"
01:52:37;01:52:38;"And it's Mona Lisa"
01:52:38;01:52:41;"A high res image of the Mona Lisa painting"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"And Frosted Flakes"
01:52:43;01:52:44;"And it's Frosted Flakes"
01:52:44;01:52:45;"Okay Seinfeld"
01:52:45;01:52:46;"I need you"
01:52:46;01:52:47;"You're gonna have a lot of numbers to crunch"
01:52:47;01:52:48;"Just find us some dog"
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Frosted Flakes that we can re"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Maybe there's we can buy in bulk somewhere"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"And we repackage them"
01:52:53;01:52:54;"I got a suggestion"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"We take generic Corn Flakes"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"And just put some sugar in the box"
01:52:58;01:52:59;"Shake it up"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"Probably cut costs that way"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"And then it's Frosted?"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"Well"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"I mean there's sugar"
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Flakes in the box"
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Define Frosted"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"I wanna do this one"
01:53:07;01:53:08;"I think that this"
01:53:08;01:53:10;"We're gonna make serious bucks"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"With Mona Lisa Frosted Flakes"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Frosted Flakes gets on bass"
01:53:14;01:53:15;"That's right"
01:53:15;01:53:17;"Frosted Flakes gets us on bass"
01:53:17;01:53:18;"Mona Lisa makes it a double"
01:53:18;01:53:19;"I'll take it"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Um"
01:53:20;01:53:23;"The number one song in 1995 this week"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"It's Mariah Carey"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"One Sweet Day"
01:53:25;01:53:26;"It's from the same album"
01:53:26;01:53:27;"She had two songs in the top five"
01:53:27;01:53:28;"Oh cool"
01:53:28;01:53:32;"Also with Boys to Men"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Two Boys to Men features and"
01:53:34;01:53:35;"Wow"
01:53:35;01:53:36;"Oof real slow"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"Big year for R&B"
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Yeah"
01:53:39;01:53:45;"You're kinda surprised there's no like"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Alternative rock on there"
01:53:47;01:53:48;"Yeah"
01:53:48;01:53:49;"No all R&B"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"No uh Bush Glycerine or something"
01:53:51;01:53:58;"All I wanted to say"
01:54:00;01:54:06;"Now it's too late to hold you"
01:54:06;01:54:10;"Cause you've flown away"
01:54:10;01:54:14;"So far away"
01:54:14;01:54:22;"Never had I imagined"
01:54:22;01:54:29;"Living without your smile"
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Feeling"
01:54:31;01:54:36;"Knowing you hear me"
01:54:36;01:54:40;"It keeps me alive"
01:54:40;01:54:43;"Alive"
01:54:43;01:54:45;"Alright we don't have a lot of time to listen"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"Mariah Carey is great"
01:54:46;01:54:47;"The number one song right now"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"Is by 6ix9ine"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"Also known as Tekashi 6ix9ine"
01:54:51;01:54:52;"Apparently he's in some kind of trouble"
01:54:52;01:54:53;"I haven't read up on it but"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"I have no idea who that is"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"I don't want any"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"I don't think anybody should go to jail for a long time"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Anyone?"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Kind of"
01:55:00;01:55:03;"Anyway he's got the number one song on iTunes right now"
01:55:03;01:55:06;"It's called Mama featuring Nicki Minaj and Kanye West"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"From his new album Dummy Boy"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"You remember this guy Jake?"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Oh this is cool"
01:55:11;01:55:12;"It is cool"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Those like flutes?"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"As soon as the beat drops I'm gonna hate on you"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"You made her on a bitch so it's not nice"
01:55:20;01:55:22;"Tiki Taki Spanish Molly"
01:55:22;01:55:23;"She a hot tamale"

01:55:38;01:55:41;"She got beads, spent some cheese now they double D's"
01:55:41;01:55:42;"Thought I had the free kicker"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"While my mama come at home at 3"
01:55:44;01:55:47;"Thicker thicker thicker than a f***ing slicker"
01:55:56;01:55:59;"Man oh my god"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"She Instagram famous but she can't keep a job"

01:56:25;01:56:26;"Gave all my oh my jealous"
01:56:26;01:56:30;"Those flutes, those weird like pitch shifted flutes remind me of like"
01:56:30;01:56:33;"Magical Mystery Tour or something"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"Oh yeah"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"I can't stop thinking about Mona Lisa Frosted Flakes"
01:56:36;01:56:40;"I think this is a thousand dollar idea"
01:56:40;01:56:43;"Sometimes the top 5 just mutates"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"To the point where it's like we can't"
01:56:45;01:56:47;"We're not even talking about the songs anymore"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"The music just doesn't even, it's like whatever"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"This show's all about the music man"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"I don't know what you're talking about"
01:56:51;01:56:52;"You're right"
01:56:52;01:56:55;"And if it's not we gotta get back to our roots man"
01:56:55;01:56:57;"TC's all about the music"
01:56:57;01:57:01;"Instruments, notes, rhythms"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Anyway"
01:57:02;01:57:03;"They're on some of that twiddle"
01:57:03;01:57:07;"Yeah maybe"
01:57:07;01:57:09;"You know we've always"
01:57:09;01:57:12;"On this show we keep saying that we're gonna do a segment on this jam band twiddle"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"Yeah"
01:57:13;01:57:16;"Who is controversial in the jam band community"
01:57:16;01:57:18;"I think we did play part of Jamflow Man"
01:57:18;01:57:19;"Did we play part of Jamflow Man once?"
01:57:19;01:57:20;"I think we did"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"Okay we've never actually discussed it"
