00:00;00:07;"Well, we finally made it. Episode 100. And it happens to coincide with Vampire Weekend's"
00:07;00:16;"biggest show ever at Madison Square Garden. Jake and I chop it up about live music, our"
00:16;00:23;"history at MSG, plus we'll take you there in real time. This is a cross-continental"
00:24;00:31;"LA, New York, very special. Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:32;00:39;"They passed me by, all of those great romances. You were a friend to a man, me, all my rightful"
00:39;00:54;"chances. My picture clear, everything seemed so easy. And so I dealt you the blow, when"
01:00;01:07;"a bus had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying, one of us"
01:07;01:19;"is lying. Leave it only there. Time Crisis back once again. Man, this is a crazy episode."
01:19;01:27;"Not only is this episode 100, can you believe that? No, it's wild. Well, you know, Jake,"
01:27;01:32;"you haven't been on every episode. How many episodes has Jake been on? Like 91? Yeah."
01:32;01:38;"More? 95? Get a number crunch. Well, how many episodes did you do in New York back in the"
01:38;01:45;"summer of 2015? I feel like only like three or four. So when do I make my first appearance?"
01:45;01:53;"I was zigzagging in those early days. Bi-coastal. Yeah, bi-coastal elite. Time Crisis Wiki says,"
01:54;01:58;"Jake, you started on episode three. See, that makes sense to me. Like I did a couple and"
01:58;02:03;"then I was like in LA. I think I've missed a few. Oh yeah, you missed eight and nine."
02:03;02:08;"I was in China. And 11. Yeah, it was a little patchy. So is it possible Jake's done like"
02:08;02:15;"96, 95? Bulk of the series. 95. All right, well, we can still celebrate episode 100 together."
02:18;02:25;"Yeah. You'll always be the new guy to me. That's just like a classic like band thing."
02:25;02:31;"Like the Eagles or like, no, the Stones. Oh yeah. Ron Wood joining in like 1971 or something."
02:31;02:35;"Yeah. Sometimes it's half a joke. And then I think sometimes it like, it's kind of real."
02:35;02:40;"I could totally picture the Stones on like Voodoo Lounge tour in the nineties just being"
02:40;02:44;"like, you know what, dude, that's not how we do stuff. He's like, I've been in the band"
02:44;02:50;"20 years, man. Come on. Mick's just kind of like, come on, dude. Too soon. You weren't"
02:50;02:54;"there at Altamont, man. Yeah. You don't know what we've been through. So it's been a journey."
02:54;03:00;"100 Eps and you're playing MSG. Yeah. So this is both the hundredth episode and the Madison"
03:00;03:05;"Square Garden show, which I'm not going to make. Unfortunately. This is a real time crisis,"
03:05;03:11;"right? This is a semi banked up in that we're pre-taping our conversation right now in LA,"
03:11;03:18;"but then we'll be getting some colorful interviews and textures and sounds from the garden show."
03:18;03:23;"So what you're getting is kind of like a very postmodern collage of a mid August to mid"
03:23;03:30;"September LA, New York kind of thing. So yeah, Madison Square Garden, September 6th. What"
03:30;03:35;"day of the week is that? Friday. Nice dude. Friday night. Friday night in New York city."
03:35;03:41;"Still be dressed to kill. You know, it's wild. I found out that our Madison Square Garden show is"
03:41;03:48;"40 years to the day of a dead show at the garden. Sick. Of course they were doing a run a few nights,"
03:48;03:56;"but the Grateful Ted did perform September 6th, 1979 at the garden. I listened to a little bit"
03:56;04:01;"of the show. How was it? It was, um, I'm not a big enough dead head where I can like parse out the"
04:01;04:08;"different years in terms of the live recordings. Like I don't have a take on 79 real dead heads do,"
04:08;04:13;"but I'm sure in like really broad strokes, you can have some sense of early seventies late. Well,"
04:13;04:17;"even just by the songs. Oh yeah. Broad strokes. I get it. Yeah. But like people are like deep in"
04:17;04:22;"where they can be like 80 versus 79. I remember when I was checking out the show, I forget what"
04:22;04:28;"song I was listening to. I was like pretty fast, really fast eyes. Let's check out a brown eyed."
04:28;04:38;"Oh, I wouldn't say this is fast. This is like spirited. This feels good. Way better than too"
04:38;05:00;"slow. Keep that ambient room tone pretty high. Yeah."
05:01;05:15;"Yeah. It's good to remember. Like sometimes when I watch crowd videos from other people's shows,"
05:15;05:19;"cause like sometimes you're playing like a quiet song and you look out and you see many,"
05:19;05:24;"many people just like eyes focused on the band, taking it in. But still, anytime you play a quiet"
05:24;05:29;"song, you can hear some chatter. You're going to see some movement. And the more I watched like"
05:29;05:35;"other bands stuff, like you just got to accept like that's how it is for everybody. Sure. Anytime"
05:35;05:39;"you're playing in a venue bigger than like a small theater. Yeah. Somebody's going to have"
05:39;05:47;"to go get a drink. Some people checked out. It's about the vibe. I don't know why you're"
05:47;05:54;"going to just like jawbone through all of brown eyed women. You're talking about this drama at"
05:54;06:00;"work that happened. And I guess 1979 people didn't have cell phones. Probably some deadheads hadn't"
06:00;06:09;"seen each other in like a few months. Last time I saw you was Rochester. Man, I haven't seen you."
06:09;06:13;"Last April. That brown eyed sounded good. Yeah, that sounded great actually."
06:16;06:20;"China. Yeah."
06:20;06:29;"This feels kind of slow. I wonder if I was listening to a different show. Yeah. None of"
06:29;06:34;"this sounds too fast to me. Crowd is so loud. I can barely hear the band."
06:42;06:46;"Also, who's just like cheering mid song like,"
06:46;06:50;"like when they start, I guess the song technically just started."
06:50;07:12;"Pretty tight. Let's check out this Terrapin. So I just love like 1979 New York. Yeah. Just"
07:12;07:19;"like picture just like punk rock, like porno theaters in Times Square, early hip hop."
07:19;07:27;"The dead rolling through multiple nightstand. Just like outside. Just like funky ass 1979"
07:27;07:32;"New York. Like he has somebody blessed and rappers delight off like a giant boombox."
07:42;07:45;"Bob, we're like leaving the bus hearing a little bit of the"
07:45;07:49;"rappers delight coming out of a boombox. That's a bit of a different sound. Oh man."
07:49;07:55;"How many shows have you seen at MSG? Good question. Who have you seen? I know you've"
07:55;08:01;"seen Billy Joel. I saw Billy Joel there. Okay. I can probably go backwards. Cause like growing up,"
08:01;08:06;"I never really saw one. Like I definitely didn't go to anything there as a kid. So the first time"
08:06;08:12;"I'm pretty sure I went to Madison square garden was when I was like 16 or 17. I saw radio head"
08:12;08:19;"there. Sick. What tour? The amnesiac tour. Wow. Which really was kind of like the tour for kid"
08:19;08:24;"a and amnesiac. Cause they came out like saying a year or a year apart, but it was a good show."
08:24;08:29;"Played all the hits paranoid Android, right? Everything in its right place. Probably a"
08:29;08:34;"pyramid song. I have not heard amnesiac in probably like 15 years. Throw that on. Were"
08:34;08:39;"you into that? Yeah. I liked him. I actually liked him kneejack more than kid a contrarian."
08:39;08:43;"Well, I don't know. They both have great songs. I think today is like one of the most overrated"
08:43;08:49;"records in retrospect. The first song is tight. It really falls off like bar."
08:49;08:56;"Like, come on. That's actually, that's filler. I feel like we had this conversation before"
08:56;08:59;"I had this conversation with somebody. It definitely sounds like a Jake conversation"
08:59;09:03;"where there was something about like when these albums came out on the last episode,"
09:03;09:07;"we were talking about like that. I was at this age when I'm like the strokes and white stripes"
09:07;09:12;"came out that I was kind of like very good. Yeah. Like I was, I was like already just becoming,"
09:12;09:18;"we talked about this recently. Yeah. Very recently when those bands came out. Yeah. I could like see"
09:18;09:21;"the references and I love them and respected them, but I was just like lost some of that childlike"
09:21;09:26;"innocence. Also at the same time, it was like radio had coming out where I was felt like I was"
09:26;09:30;"like a full like music nerd consumer, like reading the press and being like, Oh yeah. Radio has"
09:30;09:37;"re-influenced by can. And then I'd like go by can Tago Mago at borders. That's tight. I definitely"
09:37;09:40;"doing your homework. Oh yeah. And then I'd like, listen to that and I'd be like, okay, I see what"
09:40;09:44;"they're saying. And then I just like got into can that way, which again is cool, but it's like,"
09:44;09:49;"it's a little bit less passionate than just the, being like 13 and just hearing a song just be"
09:49;09:53;"like, Whoa. And this was like the time I felt closest to radio head in my life with these"
09:53;09:57;"albums. I was really excited for them to come out. Cause you loved okay. Computer. Yes. And"
09:57;10:03;"the bends loved them both. Yeah. The great highly anticipated records. And I convinced myself that"
10:03;10:07;"I loved kid a, when it came out, cause I was so excited about it coming out. Well, cause there"
10:07;10:11;"were a lot of people who actually had the opposite thing where the kid came out, or at least this is"
10:11;10:15;"how the story goes. And people are like, Whoa, this doesn't sound like the radio head progressive"
10:15;10:20;"rock band that I like. It took some of the fans a minute to realize, Oh, this is a good album."
10:20;10:25;"I feel like we were expecting that they would come out with the like different crazy record,"
10:25;10:30;"like a deliberately artistically looking forward record. You knew they were going to do something."
10:30;10:34;"Yeah. Cause they like stepped it up hard because the bands is basically like a classic rock record."
10:34;10:45;"Yeah. Great record, but yeah, full classic rock. I love the bands. And then okay. Computer is like"
10:45;10:50;"much more abstract, weird. When you were a kid, you weren't one of those people who was like,"
10:50;10:55;"scandalized by like some glitchy instrumental do this. Yeah. And I was like really into it"
10:55;11:00;"for months, years. And then I just now looking back, I'm like, that's not, that's not that good."
11:00;11:05;"I love the controversial. Well, the thing I was going to say, and this is a conversation I could"
11:05;11:09;"picture having with you where we were talking about, and you're talking about that song,"
11:09;11:14;"national anthem. And I'm pretty sure I was like, you know, cause I know all like the nerd facts"
11:14;11:17;"about it. Cause I'd read about it a lot at that time. And I was like, Oh, did you know that they"
11:17;11:21;"actually wrote that riff when they were in middle school? And I feel like you were like, yeah,"
11:21;11:28;"sounds like it. That makes sense. It does suck. Throwing track two of kid egg. Is that song is"
11:28;11:33;"just like, what is this? Is this just going to be like, like a really half-assed version of one of"
11:33;11:37;"those like podcasts with people go through an entire album. We'll do half the record."
11:37;11:45;"The year was 2000, a new millennium radio head had just"
11:49;11:54;"I'm so familiar with like the really boring. I love it. But the story of radio head can get a"
11:54;12:00;"little borderline, like Marvel cinematic universe fandom, right? After the game changing success"
12:00;12:06;"of okay. Computer, everybody wanted to know what they do next, what they released,"
12:06;12:19;"change the world forever, like for a new millennium, for a new millennium."
12:19;12:32;"I don't know if I watch one too many YouTube videos about this. It actually makes that,"
12:32;12:37;"which is an amazing song sound bad to me. So that was yeah. Undeniably great song track two."
12:37;12:44;"Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon. A lemon. So this I've probably not heard in like 10 years"
12:44;12:48;"track two. Track. This is sick. Track two is cool. Cause I remember just being like, what is this?"
12:48;12:55;"I mean, eventually I got to that point. Like I said, initially I was like, this is so sick."
12:55;12:58;"Yeah. This is like high art. I need to like absorb this and like,"
12:59;13:02;"understand it. Which is a good impulse to have."
13:02;13:11;"This sounds pretty good. But I was like, yeah, okay. Cool."
13:11;13:24;"This still sounds tasteful though 20 years later. I'm kind of into it right now."
13:25;13:31;"I mean, I haven't heard in 10 years, so that's like, that's kind of fresh."
13:31;13:47;"See that? Well, that's so interesting that they like took a riff. They wrote in middle school."
13:47;13:53;"Like maybe they were like, like, like maybe they were like, we're like getting too far up our own"
13:53;14:00;"arses here and we need to like pull back from the super, super limp biscuit."
14:00;14:06;"Now we're just picturing Tom York rapping about middle school over this."
14:20;14:23;"If they turn this song into kind of like, you know, like the first few Kanye albums,"
14:23;14:27;"there's always like this kind of like attempt to kind of tell the story of Kanye,"
14:27;14:32;"like from his childhood or his early years. If last call. Yeah. If this was like Radiohead,"
14:32;14:36;"just kind of like telling the story of like, you know what? We dropped three albums in the nines,"
14:36;14:41;"but don't get it twisted. Like this is how we came up. Oxford, England, rock scene."
14:41;14:50;"Yo, picture this eighth grade. We've been doing this since eighth grade, man."
14:50;15:01;"Yeah, this is weak. I'm not mad at it. If everything is right place,"
15:01;15:04;"undeniable classic. Yeah. It's like the two rock songs are kind of like,"
15:04;15:09;"they're good. They're just obviously less game changing. And then Idiotech is pretty undeniably"
15:09;15:16;"cool. Oh, yeah. Is this the one that's like has the same lyrics as Life in the Fast Lane?"
15:16;15:20;"Everything all of the time. Oh, yeah."
15:20;15:27;"Oh, yeah."
15:27;15:38;"Actually, that kind of sounds like a late Tom York lyric. I can totally picture that."
15:39;15:45;"Life in the fast lane. Everything all of the time."
15:45;15:50;"What are the other lyrics to Life in the Fast Lane? I don't know. I'm trying to think. It's"
15:50;16:00;"hard to hear with the music. She was a stone cold woman and she was terminally pretty."
16:01;16:08;"He was a hot headed man. He was brutally handsome and she was terminally pretty."
16:08;16:15;"She held him up and he held her for ransom in the heart of the cold, cold city."
16:15;16:21;"So far so good. It works. Had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude."
16:21;16:30;"Said he was ruthless, said he was crude. They had one thing in common. They were good in bed."
16:30;16:32;"She said faster, faster than light."
16:32;16:50;"OK. Yeah. I can't picture Tom York saying they had one thing in common. They were good in bed."
16:50;16:58;"OK, but yet to me, that's a little more in common with Hotel California than"
16:58;17:02;"with the average person. Yeah, Kittay is their Hotel California, but Amnesiac, man,"
17:02;17:06;"that's their Boys of Summer. I know what you mean. In some weird way,"
17:06;17:11;"maybe like pound for pound Amnesiac or like on average, Amnesiac is more interesting."
17:11;17:15;"I don't know if it has a standout song like Everything in Its Right Place."
17:15;17:16;"Remind me what the..."
17:16;17:26;"This is track one, which is cool, but I can't step to Everything in Its Right Place."
17:55;17:59;"This song is cool. Yeah. I was like, this album is like more playful in a weird way."
17:59;18:04;"Pyramid song, huge."
18:04;18:19;"I guess my favorite Radiohead record after OK Computer is probably In Rainbows."
18:19;18:24;"That's the one I'll go back to more. Oh, yeah. I know people love In Rainbows."
18:24;18:26;"I was a little checked out by then."
18:40;18:53;"Jumped in the river, what did I see? Black-eyed angels swam with me."
18:58;19:11;"I moved for the stars and asked your car. And all the fingers I used to see."
19:11;19:18;"I was like, the last song, this is definitely not like anybody's top 10 Radiohead song, but"
19:18;19:23;"it's just this kind of like sad, jazzy song."
19:23;19:23;"Oh, yeah."
19:23;19:28;"I feel like they like almost never play this song live."
19:28;19:42;"Wait, what's the like Chet Bakery one on the new Vampire?"
19:42;19:43;"Oh, My Mistake."
19:43;19:44;"Right."
19:44;19:48;"It's just My Mistake. Yeah. Paladin."
19:48;20:03;"I'm in trouble with my old friend. She is paper and the wind opens."
20:06;20:19;"She is putting on a smile. Living in a glass house."
20:22;20:41;"Once again. Packed like frozen fin, battery in. Think of all the stars in my eyes."
20:45;20:57;"Don't talk politics and don't throw stones. Your royal high says."
21:02;21:17;"Of course, I'd like to sit around the chair. Of course, I'd like to stand and cheer my friend."
21:22;21:31;"Of course, I'd like to sit around the chair. This song was listening."
21:31;21:38;"Let me see. What else have I seen there? It's like straight up garden concerts."
21:38;21:41;"I know I saw Red Hot Chili Peppers there once."
21:41;21:42;"What year?"
21:42;21:48;"This would be like, I feel like '06, '07. I think it was the era when I was like a teacher."
21:48;21:52;"So I feel like my friends like, oh, my brother has tickets. You want to come? And I was like, okay."
21:52;21:57;"Remember I went and I like Red Hot Chili Peppers. I was like, this is tight. They're fun to watch"
21:57;22:01;"perform. But I remember I was so brutally tired because I was just like, I was a working stiff"
22:01;22:06;"man. So just probably. Taking the train from like Bed-Stuy. Yeah, yeah. Probably jumping on the"
22:06;22:14;"train from Bed-Stuy to get to the garden. Probably woke up at like 6 a.m., four and a half hours of"
22:14;22:19;"sleep all week vibe. Slamming like a hot dog outside the arena. Yeah. And then I just remember"
22:19;22:23;"kind of like sitting there and being like, and the seats were really far away. Terrible seats."
22:23;22:27;"So I just remember kind of just being like, oh, tight, Chili Peppers. And then I just remember"
22:27;22:32;"kind of like just drifting in and out. Just no energy for me. So that was a very memorable show"
22:32;22:38;"for me. Absolutely not the fault of the Chili Peppers. Under the bridge downtown. I probably"
22:38;22:43;"perked up for that. Then, yeah, I saw Billy Joel there. I remember you were texting me, I think,"
22:43;22:48;"from the Billy Joel show. Oh, yeah. It was tight. Set list. It was a great show. I've seen Kanye"
22:48;22:57;"there twice. Okay. Great shows. Yeezus tour and Pablo. So more recent. Yeah. Both were very exciting,"
22:57;23:02;"unique stage setups. Yeah. Straight up at the garden. I don't know. What about you?"
23:02;23:08;"I think I've seen two shows there. The Foo Fighters. Okay. And Phoenix. Oh, wait. Did Dirty"
23:08;23:13;"Projectors open for Phoenix? Yes. And the Foo Fighters? They did not open for Foo Fighters."
23:13;23:17;"Yeah. That would have been tight. Foo Fighters, I went with Michael Azarad. Oh, yeah. Because he's"
23:17;23:24;"known Grow Forever. He hit me up when I was living there. Yeah. Like 2010 or 11. He's like,"
23:24;23:30;"""Dude, I got all access passes to Foo's tonight at the garden."" I was like, ""Okay, man."" You know"
23:30;23:38;"what his connection was? Was Bob Mould was doing an opening DJ set. And so the connection for him"
23:38;23:43;"was not to Grow. And so then we're wandering in and I was like, ""When did you see Grow last?"" And"
23:43;23:49;"he's like, ""94."" And I was like, ""Whoa, dude."" So then we walked into the backstage area. Yeah."
23:49;23:53;"And Grow was just like, ""Michael Azarad."" Well, well, well. ""Been a long time."" That kind of"
23:53;24:00;"thing. So he was just spending some 80s hardcore? I don't remember the DJ set per se."
24:00;24:06;"That's another one of those bands when I was kind of in this curious spending every dime I could"
24:06;24:11;"possibly get my hands on music. Yeah. I was very much like, I'm sure I read that in Rolling Stone"
24:11;24:15;"or something like, ""Who's to do Zen Arcade? A very important record."" I was like, ""I want to learn"
24:15;24:20;"about this."" So then you'd buy it. Yeah, buy it on CD. Yeah. That's how you learned about it."
24:20;24:24;"I don't remember I got too deep into it, but I was like, ""This is cool."" Yeah. I've tried with"
24:24;24:32;"the Dew. It was never like the Dew. Never quite poppy enough for me, but maybe it'll sound great"
24:32;24:40;"right now. What year is this? '85 or something? '84."
25:08;25:13;"We should try to get Grohl on sometime. Sure. One thing to keep in mind about Dave Grohl,"
25:13;25:17;"who's famously known as the nicest guy in rock, and I think I only met him once,"
25:17;25:22;"and I was just like, ""Yeah, this is a legitimate nice dude. He's cool. He's super into music. He's"
25:22;25:28;"very supportive of other musicians and stuff. Just a chill dude."" But I think because he was"
25:28;25:33;"in Nirvana, and because the Foo Fighters got so big, one of the biggest rock bands in the world,"
25:33;25:37;"but he had his roots in Nirvana and before that in hardcore punk. Yeah."
25:37;25:40;"I think there's this whole generation of embittered punk dudes who are just like,"
25:40;25:46;"""Oh, Dave Grohl, man."" Yeah, sure. One time I was having to come across on YouTube"
25:46;25:53;"something of the dude from the Melvins telling the story. God. It's the dude from the Melvins"
25:53;25:57;"doing an acoustic performance, and he makes a joke about Dave Grohl, and he's like, ""You know what?"
25:57;26:01;"I'll tell you a story about Dave Grohl, man."" Basically, the whole story boils down, and it's"
26:01;26:06;"unclear if he's actually trying to throw Dave Grohl under the bus, or it's a story about just"
26:07;26:13;"his own neuroses. But he tells the story that, as I recall, I might be missing something."
26:13;26:19;"Basically, it boils down to Dave Grohl running into him somewhere, maybe not responding to a text"
26:19;26:25;"at some point, but then running into him again and inviting him to a baseball game or something."
26:25;26:30;"Then just out of pure spite, the dude from the Melvins is like, ""Then I just didn't go."" It's"
26:30;26:36;"like, ""Fuck him."" He no-showed on Grohl. Grohl's just hanging out at the box office at Shea Stadium."
26:36;26:40;"Maybe I got to pull this up for a second. Who's the leak on the Melvins? Is it Buzz or whatever?"
26:40;26:44;"Yeah. Okay. Well, here's an article about it. We're going to need to pull up the whole video."
26:44;26:50;"He said Chris Novoselic was playing on a Melvins album, and they were going to get Grohl too,"
26:50;26:54;"and then Grohl was just a no-show. It was his idea. I didn't appreciate that. I'm a lot of"
26:54;26:58;"things, but one thing I'm not doing is sitting next to the phone in curlers waiting for Dave"
26:58;27:00;"Grohl to call me. Curlers."
27:00;27:07;"And then I'm pretty sure that in the video, it was something about Dave Grohl maybe trying to"
27:07;27:12;"make amends and invite him to a concert. Maybe he's like-"
27:12;27:13;"Baseball game would be so random."
27:13;27:17;"Yeah. Maybe it wasn't a baseball game. Maybe it was a Rolling Stones concert or something,"
27:17;27:21;"and he's just like, ""You know what, man? Fuck you. I'm not going."" So I can't tell if he's"
27:21;27:27;"telling that story to make the point of like... Because obviously it's not cool to not show up"
27:27;27:30;"when you said you were going to show up. I don't think any of us could defend that. I don't know"
27:30;27:36;"if that's the type of thing that needs to be aired out on Main Street. I do think there's certain"
27:36;27:42;"things when you take them into the public sphere, even if Dave Grohl owed you a phone call, taking"
27:42;27:46;"that down onto Main Street, that arguably is the worst thing to do. So I couldn't tell if he was"
27:46;27:51;"telling the story to be like, ""And that's why Dave Grohl's a piece of shit."" Or if the story was"
27:51;27:57;"like, ""You know what, man? I'm a complicated, angry guy. I have my roots in punk rock. What"
27:57;28:03;"do you expect?"" I'm also a child. Anyway. So Dave Grohl is basically like the Tom Hanks of rock,"
28:03;28:08;"but then I feel like if you go a little beneath the surface, you probably got a whole gang of"
28:08;28:13;"old school punk rockers like, ""Oh yeah. I remember in DC, I saw him at the whatever,"
28:13;28:17;"minor threat gig. He always thought that he was cock of the walk."""
28:17;28:19;"He's brown nosing Ian."
28:19;28:23;"Yeah. I bet there's some of that stuff, but I got to say, I don't know about the dude from"
28:23;28:30;"Melvin's, but Dave Grohl, he invited Pat Smear to become a member. A true OG punk rocker. He's got"
28:30;28:34;"Bob Mould DJing at the Garden. Flew him out from Minneapolis."
28:34;28:39;"Who knows the backstory there. Maybe Mould's sort of like, ""Oh man, it's a good gig. I'm"
28:39;28:44;"getting paid a lot. This guy's trying to leech off my credibility."" Or they're old school friends."
28:44;28:45;"I don't know."
28:45;28:51;"At the Garden in 2010, who knows? Human relations are complicated. Bob Mould gets the call and he's"
28:51;29:00;"like, ""Oh man, it's Grohl. He's blown me off twice in a row for coffee."" Well, it's not a bad check"
29:00;29:06;"to go DJ and I love to DJ, so I guess I'll do it, but I'll forgive, but I won't forget, man."
29:06;29:09;"You blew me off twice for coffee, Grohl."
29:09;29:12;"And somehow that resulted in me with pretty good seats."
29:12;29:13;"Right."
29:13;29:17;"Watching a three hours long Foo Fighters show."
29:17;29:20;"So you watched the whole show? How familiar were you with the music?"
29:20;29:27;"I mean, I know the hits. ""There goes my..."" I think he did a Hero acoustic solo."
29:27;29:27;"Okay."
29:27;29:32;"It was like a catwalk that sort of went out into the stadium and he did that one solo."
29:32;29:37;"I'll always love one of their first singles. ""Big need to talk about it."""
29:37;29:40;"Yeah. I wish they did more stuff like that. A little more jangly."
29:40;29:42;"I could see them getting back into it."
29:42;29:45;"It got real hard. They got into really hard rock."
29:45;29:46;"They got into borderline metal."
29:46;29:48;"Well, it's just like, ""You're losing me here."""
29:48;29:50;"I respect it though."
29:50;29:50;"Okay, cool."
29:50;29:53;"You don't respect..."
29:53;29:57;"I mean, I guess I don't really know what even that means. I don't like it. I guess..."
29:57;29:58;"Do I respect it? I don't know."
29:58;30:01;"You know the difference between liking and respecting something?"
30:01;30:02;"What exactly do you respect?"
30:02;30:03;"Okay, who's the..."
30:03;30:04;"Like zero down on that for me."
30:04;30:08;"You know, one of the founding fathers, there's a famous quote about free speech."
30:08;30:11;"It's a side note. Let me get a number crunch on this. Which founding father said,"
30:11;30:13;"""Sir, I may not agree with what you have to say,"
30:13;30:16;"but I will fight to the death to defend your right to say it."""
30:16;30:20;"Well, I'm not talking about whether the Foo Fighters have a right to make really hard rock."
30:20;30:25;"Wait, which founding father was it?"
30:25;30:27;"This is America. I mean, they can..."
30:27;30:29;"Hey, Azerad, who's your friend? This is Jake."
30:29;30:31;"What would you think of the show, man?"
30:31;30:34;"Well, Mr. Grohl, I'm a free speech absolutist."
30:34;30:39;"I do not agree with your decision over the last three albums to move"
30:39;30:41;"in more of a hard rock metal direction."
30:41;30:44;"However, I will fight to the death to defend your right to do so."
30:44;30:48;"All right, cool, man. Thanks for coming."
30:48;30:51;"What's the real quote, Seinfeld?"
30:51;30:52;"It's Patrick Henry."
30:52;30:53;"Oh, Patrick Henry."
30:53;30:55;"Who said it, ""I disapprove of what you say,"
30:55;30:58;"but I will defend to the death your right to say it."""
30:58;31:01;"It's also been attributed to Voltaire"
31:01;31:04;"and originated from someone named Evelyn Beatrice Hall."
31:04;31:05;"Oh, that's who really said it."
31:05;31:06;"Apparently."
31:06;31:08;"But I like, I disapprove."
31:08;31:11;"Well, Dave, I disapprove of your hard rock direction."
31:11;31:15;"I would prefer some of the janglier early materials such as Big Me."
31:15;31:20;"However, that said, I will fight to the death"
31:20;31:24;"to defend your right to move in a more hard rock direction."
31:24;31:24;"Security."

33:14;33:24;"I'm just saying that if you're like a rock band, like a real rock band, where you really stick to the palette of guitar, bass and drums,"
33:24;33:26;"which, you know, for instance, Vampire Weekend's not."
33:26;33:29;"Radiohead didn't. Neither is Radiohead."
33:29;33:33;"I actually think in some ways you got to give it up to people who do because"
33:33;33:39;"it's actually kind of easy to be like, you know, maybe I'll open this album just a vocals and keyboard song."
33:39;33:42;"You just did something different just by not picking up your guitar."
33:42;33:46;"So if you're a band who sticks to that palette, I think at a certain point"
33:46;33:51;"what you can't do is just keep going down the middle. I think either you go real jangly"
33:52;33:57;"or you go harder and harder. Either way, that's a matter of taste, but I do respect"
33:57;34:02;"choosing a direction and moving in it. And I think for every Jake that they lost along the way,"
34:02;34:05;"they probably picked up a Steve and a Tyler."
34:05;34:11;"Not Steven Tyler. Just two guys named Steven and Tyler."
34:11;34:15;"A Brad and a Kyle. Have you guys noticed that Kyle has become like"
34:16;34:22;"kind of like this joke meme name for just like a random white dude? No. I gotta say it's a good choice"
34:22;34:25;"for that type of joke. Sure. I think it was like a"
34:25;34:30;"I thought like a Chad was a classic one or like and a Chad in the kind of incel universe."
34:30;34:34;"Oh, that's right. Like a good looking guy who gets girls. Okay, so that's been a Kyle."
34:34;34:39;"A Kyle. So yeah, Chad is like heavy because that's like comes from the darker part of the internet."
34:39;34:46;"I forgot about that. Kyle is almost more just like Instagram humor, not like 4chan humor. Just kind of like, what's up Kyle?"
34:46;34:51;"I think like a lot of the jokes are about oh Kyle is the guy who punches a hole in the dry wall in the basement."
34:51;34:54;"Kyle drinks monster energy, things like that."
34:54;35:01;"And Karen is the female equivalent. It's like Karen wants to speak to the manager. Oh, yeah, like maybe Karen is Kyle's mom. Sure."
35:01;35:06;"Probably not like white. Probably not girlfriend, but mom. Yeah. Did you grow up with any Kyles?"
35:06;35:09;"I didn't grow up with any Kyles, although a good friend of mine now"
35:09;35:13;"is named Kyle. Kyle Field. When I think of Kyle's that I actually know,"
35:14;35:18;"Kyle Field is like the polar opposite of a Kyle. Oh, totally."
35:18;35:24;"And not that I like actually know him, but the first Kyle that came to mind is Kyle McLaughlin from Twin Peaks."
35:24;35:29;"Yeah, he's like a fascinating cool-ass dude. Yeah. And when you think of his name,"
35:29;35:36;"you know, you picture like the 80s being like this young actor working with David Lynch. This is Kyle McLaughlin. Yeah. Like, oh, elegant Kyle."
35:36;35:41;"What's up, Kyle? And then you have Kyle Field, like surfer, poet, songwriter. Yeah."
35:41;35:47;"You know what, guys? Not a bro. So we're canceling the Kyle meme. Kyle Mooney. Oh, and then you got Kyle Mooney."
35:47;35:52;"I think you need to go with a more common name. It wouldn't be funny though just to be like, this is Steve."
35:52;36:00;"I would almost go with Kevin above Kyle. Sure. What's up, Kevin? Kev. Kevin, why you punch the drywall? I don't know, Kyle."
36:00;36:06;"Dude, how about Todd? Todd used to be like the old one. Todd's tight. By the way, first of all,"
36:06;36:11;"we got nothing but love to all the Kyles and Kevins and Todd's listening. I mean, you know, Jake."
36:11;36:13;"Yeah, you don't choose your name. Well, you kind of chose your name."
36:13;36:20;"This is a time crisis reminder that Jake's real name is John. That's true. Jonathan Lonsdorff. No, no, no."
36:20;36:25;"It's just John. John. J-O-H-N. It's not because Jonathan's are J-O-N's. Oh, right."
36:25;36:29;"But you've been, explain to me again, you've been Jake since time immemorial, basically. Yeah."
36:29;36:34;"I mean, my dad's name is John, so I'm a junior. Right. And then my grandmother,"
36:34;36:37;"my mom's mom started calling me Jake"
36:37;36:42;"for unclear reasons. I think she was just sort of like, really? Like another John? Let's mix it up."
36:42;36:47;"And I think she, like the story was that she was like talking to some of her like golfing buddies."
36:47;36:52;"Your grandma? Yeah. She's a golfer. She was. Pasadena. Whoa."
36:52;36:54;"And someone was like, what about Jake?"
36:54;36:59;"And it just kind of stuck. Whoa. How'd your mom feel about that? I think she was cool with it."
36:59;37:04;"They had a good relationship. But it is kind of a funny situation. That sounds like out of a movie. Like mother-in-law interference."
37:04;37:10;"Just like overbearing. You're naming him John? What about Jake? What was your grandma's name? Jan. Janet."
37:10;37:15;"Not having a great game, huh, Jan? I got something on my mind. What is it? She's like"
37:15;37:18;"my f***ing grandson's name is John."
37:18;37:20;"Yeah, what's the problem? Like your son?"
37:20;37:27;"Wait, and also like. No, no. Like your husband? How many Johns were there? Jan was my mom's mom."
37:27;37:30;"Oh, okay. Jan was my dad's"
37:30;37:35;"mother-in-law. Okay, so maybe your mom had even said to her like, is it weird that my name?"
37:35;37:38;"It's kind of, it's a thing. And then your grandma walked away with it."
37:38;37:42;"It's like I got to figure this s*** out for my daughter. Right. She just had her first kid."
37:42;37:45;"Without putting a lot of thought into it, they just named him after the dad. Now"
37:45;37:51;"he got two Johns. Right. Like I got to come up with a name that's not a million miles away from John just to differentiate."
37:51;37:55;"Right. And maybe my mom was like maybe back-channeling it. Like yeah, yeah, let's do that."
37:55;38:02;"I'm not like 100% behind this name. Right. And then like my dad initially was kind of eye-rolling like, oh Jake, okay."
38:02;38:08;"And then it just stuck. Right. John Jake Pullman Longstreeth, American painter and radio personality."
38:09;38:12;"It's a strong choice my friend"
38:12;38:19;"For you to show up with a hand to lend and it's good to see you're in town"
38:19;38:26;"I hadn't heard that you were around and look at you rolling on through"
38:26;38:34;"Showing up here with a case of brew. Would you help me upload my van?"
38:35;38:38;"I've been busting my ass doing the best I can"
38:38;38:42;"Don't know how to feel"
38:42;38:46;"If my gratefulness is taken over"
38:46;38:49;"It's a hell of a deal"
38:49;38:53;"Like a horseshoe or a four-leaf clover"
38:53;38:58;"Time crisis with Ezra Koenig. This your rule"
38:58;39:02;"Wait, how did we get into that? Oh, we're just talking about like Kyles and stuff"
39:02;39:07;"Yeah, so, you know in another world, it could have been a Jake maybe eventually it'll just be an Ezra"
39:07;39:12;"Let's see. Anyway, nothing but love but I do kind of remember there's something about the internet too that I gotta say"
39:12;39:19;"There's a depressing side to it. That's a kind of unique observation of mine. It's not all fun and games on the internet"
39:19;39:22;"I'm starting to realize damn dude. Yeah"
39:22;39:25;"Obviously, there's a million terrible things about the internet"
39:25;39:27;"But one thing that kind of bums me out"
39:27;39:32;"It's like a little bit part of the reason why I don't quite as actively participate in social media"
39:32;39:34;"Because I was maybe becoming this type of person"
39:34;39:41;"there's just like a thing where you just see jokes get played out like instantly and then you get can get too in your head about"
39:41;39:43;"like people just making kind of like"
39:43;39:46;"lame jokes and you're making lame jokes and it's all just like"
39:46;39:52;"It kind of feels like oh everybody's riffing on a meme, but it's also everybody's like kind of repeating the same thing"
39:52;39:55;"which um has very serious political implications, but also"
39:55;39:59;"There's just something about like like even karen. Can I talk to the manager?"
39:59;40:02;"I remember when I first saw that this idea of the talk to the manager haircut"
40:02;40:06;"I was like wow what an incisive funny way to identify a type of"
40:06;40:09;"privileged angry entitled person blah blah and then just suddenly like"
40:09;40:14;"People were saying it's too much to the point that it was kind of like honestly"
40:14;40:18;"Just it's not funny. Just like make a more straightforward statement about what you're trying to say"
40:18;40:23;"It's like when people just like repetition on top of repetition. I feel like another classic one is sir. This was an arby's"
40:23;40:27;"Right, which the first time I saw that I was like that's hilarious"
40:27;40:30;"And then I saw it like 30 times"
40:30;40:35;"Like the next day. Yeah, like imagine for like 11 months when you're 14"
40:35;40:41;"You and like your knucklehead friends were like sitting at an arby's and you guys like cooked up a situation"
40:41;40:44;"You like see some weirdo guy walking. You're like, what's that dude?"
40:44;40:48;"Just like sitting there like beavis and but it's not just like"
40:48;40:50;"What's that guy's doing?"
40:50;40:52;"You're like he's probably blah and you like cook up a story"
40:52;40:58;"And then somehow it culminates with a bunch of like knucklehead 14 year olds being like sir, this is an arby's"
40:58;41:01;"For like the next 11 months, that'd be like a great. Yeah"
41:01;41:05;"And there's just with your crew of friends and also it's nobody's fault"
41:05;41:09;"It's just that the internet is a crew of billions of friends at least hundreds of millions"
41:09;41:16;"So it's like dear friends of dear friends. So it's almost like you just watch it get sucked away so quickly"
41:16;41:18;"Yeah, and so there's even something about like yeah"
41:18;41:24;"I can almost remember like being in middle school or something and I feel like we had some jokes about like"
41:24;41:26;"Hey, todd"
41:26;41:31;"Maybe it's a good thing. It reminds all of us. We're not that special in terms of what we find funny"
41:31;41:33;"like I kind of right everyone kind of"
41:33;41:37;"Arrives at the same joke at the same time. Yeah, right"
41:37;41:41;"So if you're kind of thinking like in 1999 me and my friends"
41:41;41:44;"We had this kind of like inside joke about this like character named todd"
41:45;41:47;"We could just crack each other up just saying like todd"
41:47;41:51;"Because you know, we just had this kind of unique insight into like why the name todd was funny"
41:51;41:54;"We didn't even have to like explain it. We were then you're kind of like yeah, man"
41:54;42:01;"Every town had at least one group of knuckleheads not even just giggling about like a dude with like a name with that name todd"
42:01;42:06;"We probably even all just like saw like the same episode of kids in the hall and just like don't even remember"
42:06;42:13;"Maybe it's not a bad thing. Maybe that's just what life is is just kind of you know repeating. Yeah"
42:13;42:18;"I guess the internet just disabuses you of the idea that you're you and your friends are unique. Yeah"
42:18;42:24;"Anyway, now that kyle and todd have become those types of names the clock's ticking until a forward-thinking person is just like you know"
42:24;42:29;"What i'm gonna name my kid kyle and he's gonna be a cool-ass kid and then you guys still like, you know"
42:29;42:33;"Beavis and butthead style chuckling about the name kyle. He'll just look at you"
42:33;42:39;"Be like, you know, you guys are 45 chuckling about my name. I'm the coolest 12 year old in the world"
42:39;42:42;"I'm an environmental activist"
42:42;42:47;"My name is kyle. You guys are chuckling about some 20 year old meme. What the fuck?"
42:47;42:54;"You guys blame the boomers for ruining the world. It was you look in the mirror. It was you it was the fucking millennials"
42:54;42:57;"That's also a big one coming up. I feel like there's become a thing"
42:57;43:02;"Understandably for good reason where people are kind of like being very critical of the boomer generation"
43:02;43:05;"You have to be critical of every generation"
43:05;43:11;"But I do think that anytime you see that happening because the funny thing is the boomers of course were hyper critical of their parents"
43:11;43:15;"Generation, right and they felt were really feeling themselves. We're more open-minded than you"
43:15;43:18;"We're helping to get the civil rights bill passed"
43:18;43:25;"We're changing the world and you guys all you guys did was go fight in world war ii and come back and start fast food companies"
43:25;43:31;"You know, we're the ones changing the world and then I think there's like a real joy in pointing out the hypocrisy of being like"
43:31;43:35;"But your generation blah blah and of course every generation you're talking about millions and millions of people"
43:35;43:40;"So it's kind of funny to get too specific. Anyway, it's really the industrial revolution generation"
43:40;43:44;"That's everything up. But anyway, it's one thing to point that out and be like, yeah the boomers"
43:44;43:49;"Let's be critical of them, you know a lot of bad things happen in there. Let's examine, you know"
43:49;43:53;"Some of our sacred cows are bill clinton's, you know, let's really get into this. Let's talk about this"
43:53;44:00;"I get that but the thing is you buy into the meme too hard and everything becomes like boomers ruin the world"
44:00;44:03;"I literally was born into a hellscape that the boomers created then"
44:03;44:06;"Nobody is as surprised as a revolutionary"
44:06;44:11;"Rebelled against that's a famous quote. I think already it's probably happening"
44:11;44:14;"But it's going to be hardcore in 10 20 years like a lot of millennials"
44:14;44:19;"Will be just kind of like yeah making like kyle and can I talk to the manager jokes and they'll be like these young"
44:19;44:25;"This new generation of like kyle's and karen's just being like so you guys knew you had this boomer problem"
44:25;44:29;"And you spent all day on twitter my boomer grandparents or they kind of suck"
44:29;44:35;"But nobody sucks worse than you guys. You are the generation that ruined the millennia. Whoa. Hold on man"
44:36;44:42;"You hold on a second generation x is gonna get some heat, but then they'll just be like we never had any ambitions"
44:42;44:44;"We never had any stated goals or ideals. So"
44:44;44:52;"Generation x is the smallest generation that was recently pointed out the new york times generation x special"
44:52;44:56;"What are the years on x am I x? Oh, you're totally x I mean temperamentally"
44:56;44:59;"Temperamentally i'm very x"
44:59;45:02;"I just don't know if i'm actually tech. No, you're you're in the sweet spot of x seinfeld"
45:03;45:05;"Now"
45:05;45:08;"Let's get a number crunch brought to you by"
45:08;45:12;"Seinfeld 2000 generation x, uh"
45:12;45:17;"Born from the early to mid 60s to the early 80s. Okay"
45:17;45:24;"Yeah, wait what no because millennials are like early 80s early 80s. Oh, I see. No, but it's got to end somewhere"
45:24;45:26;"So it's like a little crossover. Oh 81"
45:27;45:32;"61 to 81 any definition of generation x is going to include 77 proud to be part of that generation"
45:32;45:35;"Yeah, it's like a smaller birth rates declined a bit"
45:35;45:41;"So it's like a smaller just like in the big new york times thing. They were just talking about like beto o'rourke"
45:41;45:46;"Oh, he's very x and they were saying like and actually one of the interesting things that they said in this article"
45:46;45:54;"Which was you know had its ups and downs was kind of like generation x is a really small generation and judging by"
45:54;46:00;"You know how things are going for beto. It's actually very possible. There will never be a generation x president"
46:00;46:08;"Well, it wasn't oh brocco obama no he was early 60s, right? Yes, he born 62 or something"
46:08;46:12;"Right barack obama. I think is counted as like a late boomer"
46:12;46:14;"Yeah"
46:14;46:18;"He's closest and they're just kind of like not very generation x in terms of his vibe either"
46:18;46:23;"Yeah, and remember we talked about all the presidents being born in the same month basically in the 40s"
46:23;46:28;"so it's just totally possible that whether it's trump or biden or bernie or"
46:28;46:33;"Warren or whoever another boomer. It's just possible that it could be another boomer and then"
46:33;46:41;"The white house will just pass by generation x well harris is probably generation x she could be gen x. Yeah, I bet she is. Yeah"
46:41;46:43;"So we'll see"
46:43;46:49;"Just because we get around"
46:49;46:51;"Talking about my generation"
46:51;46:54;"Things they do look awful"
46:54;46:56;"Talking about my generation"
46:56;46:59;"If I die before I get old"
46:59;47:01;"Talking about my generation"
47:01;47:05;"To my generation, baby"
47:05;47:09;"Why don't you all"
47:09;47:14;"Don't try to dig what we all say"
47:17;47:20;"I'm trying to cause a big sensation"
47:20;47:34;"It's definitely the coolest name for a generation"
47:34;47:41;"Oh, yeah, millennials like the greatest generation that sucks generation x is the only good one boomers"
47:42;47:48;"Zoomers isn't great zoomers sucks zoomers is post-millennial. See that's another thing generation x had cool name"
47:48;47:51;"Kind of means a lot of different things. Nobody's gonna get fired up about"
47:51;47:59;"Generation x but millennials also millennials just like nobody really identified as generation x it was kind of like came a little bit later"
47:59;48:04;"It was already this forgotten. Nobody was worrying about them. Whereas millennials have just been up in the press for a long time"
48:04;48:07;"So I just think they were young"
48:07;48:07;"Yes"
48:07;48:12;"it's been like millennials millennials this as a millennial and like and then millennials being like oh the boomers write these like"
48:12;48:16;"Up articles about how millennials suck. Well, f**k you and i'm just saying watch out guys"
48:16;48:22;"Zoomers hate millennials and gen z is actually kind of is it's kind of cool. It's derivative though"
48:22;48:25;"Wait, hold on a sec. When does gen z start? Those are the 2000"
48:25;48:27;"Is that 2000?"
48:27;48:30;"Has to be I think it's kids who are now like"
48:30;48:35;"14 right something like that. So early 2000s. They hate the millennials"
48:35;48:41;"They might they might get wrapped into millennials in the long long term. I'm just saying whatever comes after them"
48:41;48:46;"Hell will hath no fury the millennials are gonna get it worse than the boomers ever got it"
48:46;48:51;"The boomers are gonna get some sort of weird plausible deniability be like man. We didn't know how ipads worked"
48:51;48:53;"Man"
48:53;48:57;"We were having acid we took too much acid then they hand us an ipad 40 years later, man"
48:57;49:01;"What do you think? I don't know bill clinton impression"
49:03;49:07;"They handed me an ipad man, I I don't know but i'm just saying"
49:07;49:14;"Millennials are just gonna get hit real hard just being like millennials are the sh*t generation ever and they still you know"
49:14;49:16;"It's also gonna be it's gonna be like"
49:16;49:22;"Dad, you're 59 years old and you're still talking about boomers. I literally haven't even met a boomer in my life"
49:22;49:26;"Dad, take some f**king responsibility"
49:26;49:30;"You're still talking about can I talk to the manager haircuts dad?"
49:30;49:36;"You're the one who's talking to the manager you literally just talked to the manager and the manager had to talk to the manager"
49:36;49:42;"Haircuts and you thought that was dad. What the f**k are you talking about? Well, okay, but you didn't know what those boomers were like"
49:42;49:44;"Dad, it's 130 degrees outside"
49:44;49:47;"Yeah"

54:03;54:07;"But you saw them I saw them in cleveland, but madison square garden is special"
54:07;54:11;"It's just one of those iconic venues. The only other show that i've ever seen here"
54:12;54:18;"Is you two and it's kind of appropriate because you two has been one of the most important bands in the last few decades"
54:18;54:23;"And vampire weekend is being called the most important rock band in the world right now"
54:23;54:29;"And because they're willing to evolve I think they have the potential to go the distance and be one of the most important bands"
54:29;54:35;"Ever. Wow, would you say that ezra is the new bono? I would say ezra has as much to say as bono"
54:35;54:41;"And uh, you know, he's he's he's so young. He's so young but you know more life experience"
54:41;54:45;"I think ezra is definitely going to give bono a run for his money. You heard it here first"
54:45;54:50;"Vampire weekend the new you two ezra koenig the new bono. How long have you been in town winter?"

55:21;55:27;"I get people emailing me all the time asking me about cards or mugs since i'm traveling all over the world"
55:27;55:33;"The cards are really easy to get the mugs can be logistically difficult because I travel with a backpack"
55:33;55:38;"So it's not like I can bring back 10 mugs for people and shipping them"
55:38;55:41;"Around the world can be a challenge too. Those mugs are rare, right?"
55:41;55:45;"Those embossed ones that have the sort of like texture. Those are the ones you're talking about"
55:45;55:51;"I'm talking about any mugs generally speaking starbucks mugs are highly collectible and if you're in the philippines"
55:51;55:56;"It's not the easiest thing in the world to get a mug from hungary, for example"
55:56;56:02;"I mean, so there's all sorts of forums online where people go and trade these and send them to each other"
56:02;56:06;"And you know, I don't mind, you know helping people out when I can but"
56:06;56:11;"About one mug is all I can bring back from a trip really realistically. What are the cards?"

56:16;56:22;"I'm sure when you paid but besides the normal ones for holidays and whatnot starbucks puts out"
56:22;56:29;"Ones for the major cities new york philadelphia dc all have them and they get different ones every year or two"
56:29;56:33;"So these are highly collectible and again if you're in the philippines"

57:47;57:55;"It's gonna take a little time while you're waiting like a factory line i'll ride across the park backseat on the 79"
57:55;57:59;"Wasted days you've come to pass"
57:59;58:10;"So go I know you would not stay it wasn't true"
58:10;58:12;"But anyway"
58:12;58:25;"Okay, so we're here backstage, uh in the food court sort of areas with abby"
58:25;58:30;"You're a vampire weekend fan and a tc head. Is that right? Definitely. Yeah, you know"
58:30;58:36;"Colin, uh from time crisis and I spotted you because you have the vampire weekend sweet martha's collaboration shirt that I actually worked on"
58:36;58:39;"How did you get this shirt? It's very rare shirt. It is a rare shirt"
58:39;58:45;"I was at the show in minneapolis in june and we got there early and I got the shirt"
58:45;58:50;"Was there like a fight was an aggressive situation to get that shirt or you're just very early and you were"
58:50;58:52;"Managed to get it or were people fighting over it or anything?"
58:52;58:56;"Well, actually my size ran out with the person in front of me"
58:56;59:01;"So I ended up having to get a different size, but it ended up working out fine. I love it"
59:01;59:03;"It's one of my favorite t-shirts nonetheless"
59:03;59:06;"One of these shirts went on ebay and I think it went for something like what was it?"
59:06;59:12;"800 or something or I might be exaggerating but it was I guess what i'm asking is how much would you sell this shirt for?"
59:12;59:15;"It's priceless. I wouldn't sell it for anything"
59:15;59:22;"Um, you are a tc head you've been listening to the show since the start of the summer you're saying yeah"
59:22;59:27;"So I started at the beginning of the summer with episode one and I just finished episode 70"
59:27;59:30;"So i'm not totally caught up with all of them"
59:30;59:33;"But what was an episode? I know it's probably like a blur"
59:33;59:38;"It's like binge watching a show or something. Like do you remember anything that was talked about on episode 70? I don't"
59:38;59:41;"episode 70 was all about um"
59:41;59:43;"Alanis morissette"
59:43;59:46;"Oh, it was morissette. Yeah, she was on the show talking about everything"
59:46;59:52;"Was this your introduction to alanis morissette just curious or did you had you known about her and listened to her music before that?"
59:52;59:55;"I mean i've heard like the hits but I wouldn't say that i'm like a fan of her"
59:55;59:58;"But definitely piqued my interest gonna check her out more now"
59:59;01:00:02;"So this is episode 100. So my question for you you're on 70"
01:00:02;01:00:05;"Are you gonna skip ahead to the one that you're in or are you gonna sort of like?"
01:00:05;01:00:09;"Let it marinate and work your way through. I think i'm gonna let it marinate"
01:00:09;01:00:15;"I tried to skip ahead to the one where father the bride was released. Yeah, but then it was just weird"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"I felt like I was missing out on jokes and stuff. So"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"I think i'm just gonna wait. Do you want to just give a shout out to uh,"
01:00:21;01:00:28;"You know to time crisis and congratulate them on 100 years of time crisis. Yeah way to go time crisis. You made it. Um"

01:03:05;01:03:09;"I was hoping that's what you're gonna say when you said what do you think of and i was gonna say despot's outfit on stage"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Killer that shirt was so nice and big and blousy on him"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"I'm sure it's polo because he loves polo"
01:03:14;01:03:19;"But I am curious like the print because when you see shows like I do from the stands"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"You can't get to see the clothes. It really kills me, but I love how big and blousy it was on him"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"It's polo. It was kind of like a postcard"
01:03:25;01:03:30;"Sort of motif a travel shirt sort of not a hawaiian, but an all-over print"
01:03:30;01:03:37;"Very summery perfect for the uh dog days of summer people think it's fall that it's still summer. Let's live"
01:03:37;01:03:41;"Okay, don't rush the seasons. Have you seen what ezra's wearing on stage? No"
01:03:41;01:03:47;"I saw a couple selfies, but I don't think they were stage outfits and I thought i'd be backstage with a photo pass"
01:03:47;01:03:52;"But instead i'm here with the general people, but that's fine too because I wouldn't have made it to the radio"
01:03:52;01:03:57;"Otherwise, what would you advise ezra to wear on stage? It is homecoming"
01:03:57;01:04:03;"Madison square garden show it's a big deal. You know, I hope they made him a jersey like they made. Um,"
01:04:03;01:04:08;"I believe they make jerseys for the guests that perform but I could be wrong"
01:04:08;01:04:11;"I hope they made him a nicks jersey extra extra long"
01:04:11;01:04:14;"so it's like"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"below his knees"
01:04:15;01:04:21;"With a wide wide chino, you know, I call it unnecessary frumpiness like it's still big and baggy"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"but"
01:04:23;01:04:28;"It's not getting in the way of any performing because as much as I want him to flow maybe that's an issue"
01:04:28;01:04:34;"Absolutely, if he's not feeling a jersey, maybe he didn't work out this week. He doesn't feel comfortable with the biceps or something. Let's say"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"Then I would say so what what would you say? I would say, um"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I'm all about what not to wear you like no tie-dye"
01:04:41;01:04:46;"No frog, no swirly. No, the artwork is also good though. You're wearing tie-dye"
01:04:46;01:04:51;"No, yeah, i'm the king of don't wear what i'm wearing. I'd like to see him in comfortable clothes"
01:04:51;01:04:55;"But not too comfortable. I don't want to see him in an oxford button down"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"I kind of want to see him in a t-shirt birkenstocks"
01:04:57;01:05:03;"And chinos that are really really lived in and when I say lived in I mean dad style not that style with esquire gq"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"And these magazines talk about true dad style"
01:05:05;01:05:09;"Which is picking the shit up off the floor and putting it on when your wife says go diaper her"
01:05:09;01:05:15;"You know or him in his situation, you know, we're both new tatties and i'm really learning about dad style"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"It's not what I thought it was all tucked in and neat"
01:05:17;01:05:24;"But i'd like to see him in some khakis with some room some frumpiness, you know, maybe even two pleats, you know"
01:05:24;01:05:28;"And not like with little wimpy fashion pleats but like the vintage polo and your pant"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"So while we're here, I want to ask you a couple questions"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"We've been uh banking the apps because"
01:05:33;01:05:39;"Ezra's been on tour and so when he's not around we bank the apps and so we basically there's been a lot of catching up news-wise"
01:05:39;01:05:42;"on issues that"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Our audience the tc heads really love so i'll ask you"
01:05:44;01:05:51;"Do you know no about the popeyes chicken sandwich craze, you know only from hot 97"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"They played it in the shower yesterday how they're all pissed off that it's not around anymore"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"And someone said well, they should do it like uptown sell it in the barber shop sell fakes and stuff"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"And then before that i've read about it. I read about it. I saw it on stories"
01:06:03;01:06:08;"Is it like maybe diplo had it delivered to coachella or the other festival in the desert the burning man?"
01:06:08;01:06:11;"Is it true? Is it real? Did you do it?"
01:06:11;01:06:15;"I mean if someone found an in-and-out burger in like king's highway on the floor on the street, you know, or like queens"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"So what was the question? Do I believe it?"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"You answered the question. Oh, okay"
01:06:19;01:06:25;"I'm hungry. I want chicken. All right. So angelique. Kijo is about to go on. Mr. Moore. Thank you so much"

01:08:13;01:08:20;"Hell, yeah, we've come full circle and I can't can you believe that we've done 100 years of time crisis? I can't believe it"
01:08:20;01:08:26;"I feel like we just began 100 years is uh an incredible milestone and i'm excited about the next 100"
01:08:26;01:08:30;"Yeah, I mean, you know, hopefully it'll be three four hundred years going. Uh, yeah"
01:08:30;01:08:37;"So asher you've got more context on this stuff than anybody. We've uh been banking the epps over the summer"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"Oh, yeah, I love the bank. That's yeah"
01:08:39;01:08:44;"Not as good as the fresh ones, but they're you know, it's like that sushi you get at whole foods"
01:08:44;01:08:50;"They're not cooking it right there. They're not cutting it up, but it's not it's not bad. It's not bad"
01:08:50;01:08:53;"You're still gonna eat it. So while we were banking those apps"
01:08:53;01:08:58;"There were a lot of tc-centric stories that kind of came down the pipeline that we weren't able to address"
01:08:58;01:09:02;"So I was hoping I could hit you with a few headlines. I love it. All right, cool"
01:09:02;01:09:08;"So first of all, have you been following the uh, popeyes chicken sandwich craze?"
01:09:08;01:09:14;"Yeah, actually I work across from a popeyes and I tried to go and get one because it's a it's kind of a low-key"
01:09:14;01:09:20;"Popeyes and um, it's on canal street and chinatown. It's like it's a little less on the radar"
01:09:20;01:09:23;"And so I thought i'd be able to get a sandwich there and no dice. They did not have the sandwich"
01:09:23;01:09:29;"So working near canal street is bootleg culture still going strong out there? What culture bootleg culture still going?"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"Do they have a different thing now because they've kind of taken it away"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"From the actual stores and you can't really have it on the street"
01:09:36;01:09:40;"So what they do is they've evolved and it's literally a catalog"
01:09:40;01:09:45;"and so they stand on the street with like a catalog and then you look through the catalog and pick the one you want and"
01:09:45;01:09:48;"Then they go and find it for you and come back. So yeah, it's all still there"
01:09:48;01:09:55;"But it's a if anything it's more efficient. They've evolved so sophisticated now. They've disrupted the bootlegging system"
01:09:55;01:10:00;"Uh, I don't know if you saw this but ed sheeran has launched his own line of heinz ketchup"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"Heinz and ed sheeran, uh have finally true"
01:10:03;01:10:07;"That's true. You know, nobody's believing any of these hard to you know"
01:10:07;01:10:13;"You never know with you never know with it. It could be a meme. It could be true and a meme"
01:10:13;01:10:18;"No, no, he's done commercials for it. He's done social media posts. Is there a pun? What is the"
01:10:18;01:10:19;"Yeah"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"Ed chup ed chup. Yeah"
01:10:21;01:10:27;"It doesn't really roll off the tongue. Yeah, i'm searching for the i'm searching for the clever nugget there"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"But maybe there is none. That is the clever nugget"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"uh"
01:10:31;01:10:34;"It says here that he's a self-proclaimed heinz super fan"
01:10:34;01:10:39;"And he even has the tattoo of the heinz ketchup logo seems like an odd tattoo"
01:10:39;01:10:45;"I'm a graphic designer and I can appreciate being a fan of the logo because it's classic logo"
01:10:45;01:10:50;"I've actually got like a heinz baked bean can like the british one that I put my pens in and stuff"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"So I appreciate I respect you ed on that level"
01:10:53;01:11:01;"As far as being a fan of the condiment brand itself that I can't really understand because a it's almost a monopoly"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"They're not really competing with many people and then b it's like"
01:11:04;01:11:10;"Is there a signature taste that you're really attaching yourself to there? I'm, not really sure what's so exciting about"
01:11:11;01:11:13;"Them as a brand but logo I can respect so"
01:11:13;01:11:16;"I think that's what is his ketchup?"
01:11:16;01:11:22;"Uh, it's just ketchup. I think it's just ketchup. I I don't think it's uh, I don't think it's a new flavor"
01:11:22;01:11:27;"From what I understand. It's just a collab. It's just a collab. It's just sort of he's re-skinned the ketchup"
01:11:27;01:11:32;"I think there was a new bottle design actually, okay, I guess I guess it's just like a drop"
01:11:32;01:11:39;"Just like capsule collection for 2019 summer fall and then you just you're out and yeah, and then it's just a memory"
01:11:39;01:11:44;"Yeah, and then the hypebeasts have to search for it for the rest of time and the resale market on that ketchup"
01:11:44;01:11:48;"Is just out of control. I mean Heinz they know what they're doing. They've been around a long time. So"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"well"
01:11:50;01:11:57;"Asher, I really appreciate you taking a few minutes to pleasure Seinfeld. I really I gotta say i'm not just a part of the crisis"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"Crew i'm a big fan. I've been listening"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"and uh"
01:12:01;01:12:08;"Getting choked up 100 100 years. It's a big deal. I mean, I cannot believe we started this 100 years ago"
01:12:08;01:12:12;"I mean I wasn't even part of it, but you were you're you're more core than I am to pass the torch to you"
01:12:12;01:12:16;"Simon's come you watch the red sunrise"
01:12:16;01:12:21;"The led still flickers in your eyes"
01:12:21;01:12:29;"Oh, you ought to spare face the razor because no one's gonna spare time for you"
01:12:29;01:12:37;"No one's gonna watch you as you go"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Oh"
01:12:39;01:12:43;"From a house you didn't build you can't control"

01:12:50;01:13:02;"You are the world you labor it's been 20 years and no one's told the truth"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"So"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Um"
01:13:06;01:13:18;"Don't wait"
01:13:18;01:13:24;"Don't wait"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"So"
01:13:26;01:13:50;"I'm backstage here with despot and despot and winter just had a moment for the first time here"

01:14:02;01:14:07;"First time was it was a billy joel elton john. Oh, wow double bill"
01:14:07;01:14:12;"Okay, and I was like the you know support you were in between or the first in between"
01:14:12;01:14:19;"We had uh elton first me billy. Got it. I call him just elton and billy, right?"
01:14:19;01:14:23;"Yeah, you're on that that level with them and it's kind of a despot sandwich"
01:14:24;01:14:27;"With the two. Yeah, you could say that two legends"
01:14:27;01:14:32;"despot, so, um, how are you doing today? Um, do you want to just do you want to just um"
01:14:32;01:14:38;"Hey, what's up? No. No, do you do this often? Yeah, I do. I do this. I do this a lot. Um,"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"You're good at it. Thank you very much"

01:14:42;01:14:44;"100 years of time crisis. How does it feel?"
01:14:44;01:14:48;"100 years or the 100 sorry 100th episode of time crisis"
01:14:48;01:14:54;"Is this the 100th episode 100th episode of time crisis and you obviously your core you're one of the founding fathers"
01:14:54;01:15:00;"Yeah, I invented time crisis pretty much. It's like my child, you know, and i'm proud of it"
01:15:00;01:15:06;"Yeah, because i've watched it grow and become like like try to get away from me"
01:15:06;01:15:12;"Like it moved out kind of right, but that's cool. Like I feel like we're still in touch and"
01:15:12;01:15:16;"Now it's come full circle backstage at msg for the 100th 100 year"
01:15:16;01:15:20;"Here we are back in new york where time crisis was invented and belongs"
01:15:20;01:15:25;"And might return one day. You never know if we do 200 years, right? It might come back. Yeah"
01:15:25;01:15:31;"So despot we've been banking some episodes over the summer. I don't know if you've been listening, of course"
01:15:31;01:15:32;"Yeah, right"
01:15:32;01:15:37;"and so what happens when you bank an episode is that we miss out on some of the fresher stories that uh,"
01:15:37;01:15:41;"That tend to come down the pipeline because you have to pretend that"
01:15:41;01:15:45;"Right, you're right. That's happening right now or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, exactly"
01:15:45;01:15:49;"So it gets a little weird but we were hoping that we could kind of catch up on a couple of headlines that have kind"
01:15:49;01:15:53;"Of come through. Okay. Have you been following this? Uh, jeremy renner app"
01:15:53;01:15:59;"Situation not really. I would love for someone to explain it to me. I know you could buy um"
01:15:59;01:16:04;"Stars or something. Yes, that's right. You could buy what do the stars do?"
01:16:04;01:16:10;"They just give you like more like I think if you get a lot of them jeremy like you can dm jeremy"
01:16:10;01:16:13;"I don't know. I actually don't know so it's like a pay-to-play thing"
01:16:13;01:16:18;"I think it is like you want to be friends with jeremy renner. You gotta buy x amount of stars"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"Yeah, and then you can show people that"
01:16:20;01:16:23;"He what does he do? He texts you?"
01:16:23;01:16:31;"I think he like yeah, I think he just sends you like affirmations like positive affirmations"
01:16:31;01:16:34;"Like if you get a thousand stars, he'll like come to your birthday party"
01:16:34;01:16:38;"That sounds expensive. Yeah, how much is a star?"
01:16:38;01:16:44;"It's like 50. That's a lot. I think I think so. Are you sad about it getting shut down?"
01:16:44;01:16:47;"I didn't know it was getting shut down. Oh, yeah"
01:16:47;01:16:54;"So what happened was that there was a flaw in the app and so people were trying to what was the flaw that jeremy renner is?"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"Not worth"
01:16:56;01:16:58;"$50,000 birthday party"
01:16:58;01:17:03;"Okay, jeremy if you're listening we're like this is a respectful. I have to like really come clean"
01:17:03;01:17:08;"I don't know who jeremy renner is. Oh jeremy renner. So, you know the I know about this app, but okay"
01:17:08;01:17:14;"The avengers. Oh, i've never watched an avengers thing. Are you familiar with I know the comic books?"
01:17:14;01:17:20;"Okay, do you know the bow and arrow the hawkeye? Yeah, hawkeye. So jeremy renner's hawkeye. Oh sick"
01:17:20;01:17:25;"So he's like he's kind of the best avenger yeah, maybe"
01:17:25;01:17:32;"I don't even remember who the rest of the avengers are but it's like hulk, you know, it's pretty good hulk is good"
01:17:32;01:17:36;"He doesn't have the bow and arrow though. Yeah, but he's really strong"
01:17:36;01:17:40;"He's strong and the anger gets him turns him green. There's robert downey jr"

01:17:50;01:17:52;"He plays himself"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"And this show does the fans just started calling him iron man"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"because of how strong he is"

01:18:02;01:18:07;"Scarlet i'm just naming the actors. Well because we talked we started talking about jeremy renner. That's why yeah"
01:18:07;01:18:14;"I don't think it's that weird that you did it that way. I'm getting very self-conscious about it. Um, i'm intimidating. Yeah me too"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"moving on what about uh, so the"
01:18:16;01:18:21;"The jeremy renner app is an app where you sign up for the app"

01:18:27;01:18:31;"I don't really know exactly what the stars were for. I think they were sir. Oh, wait a second"
01:18:32;01:18:36;"So it was a gathering place for fans to connect with the actor i'm reading"
01:18:36;01:18:40;"And what happened? Yeah, just to put a pin in that whole conversation. What happened was that"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"people found a way to"
01:18:42;01:18:49;"Impersonate jeremy renner so someone could go on and be like i'm i'm jeremy renner like you guys or whatever. I don't know"
01:18:49;01:18:53;"I don't know. I don't think that's what he was saying. Here's a picture of my"
01:18:53;01:19:00;"I think that's what the real jeremy renner caught wind of it and was like well, no, there's only one"
01:19:01;01:19:07;"Let's shut it down. Right and he kind of called out the tech company that made the app and it went away, right?"
01:19:07;01:19:13;"They're not protecting him. No, no, they were just yeah, but there's good news though. Jeremy has actually relaunched. What's the app called?"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"I think it's called the jeremy renner app"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"I'm gonna i'm gonna do a number crunch on the flight"
01:19:18;01:19:25;"Yeah, that's sick. Maybe I could do an app like that now that I play the show at madison square garden"
01:19:25;01:19:30;"There's probably at least 100 people who want to be my friend. Absolutely. Yeah, you could do instead of stars"
01:19:30;01:19:36;"You could do like, uh bricks bricks. Nice. Hey, okay. I want a cut of whatever"
01:19:36;01:19:40;"Yeah happens with the I want a cut of every time crisis episode"
01:19:40;01:19:48;"The app was called jeremy renner official I like that better right? Yeah, I like the official it's powerful"
01:19:48;01:19:52;"All right, maybe just one more here. I think this is kind of like on brand for you"
01:19:52;01:19:59;"I'd love to get your take on this hasbro now owns death row. Oh, yeah, I read something about that. Yeah"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"So it's kind of one of those things where they bought the company that owns death row, right?"
01:20:03;01:20:08;"Is that uh entertainment one e1 entertainment? Yeah, e1"
01:20:08;01:20:14;"Which they probably own what like a hundred different things they own madison square garden. I mean, that would be great. You know, okay"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"so"
01:20:16;01:20:22;"Yeah, so mr. Potato head and tupac are finally part of the same click on the same label. Yeah. Yeah, so"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Any thoughts on on that whole situation?"
01:20:24;01:20:28;"What do you want to see hasbro doing with the death row?"
01:20:28;01:20:33;"Brand, what do you see because I feel like people have tried to bring it back in the past who did?"
01:20:33;01:20:39;"uh, because it was owned by like an independent company for a minute and then it got I don't i'm gonna say"
01:20:39;01:20:45;"I honestly don't know that much about death row as a person who grew up in new york. I always hated"
01:20:45;01:20:50;"All that stuff. I think maybe if I was on death row. Yeah"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"Or associated with death row"
01:20:52;01:20:56;"I don't want to say anything bad about death row, right?"
01:20:56;01:21:03;"We respect death row sure death row. Thank you for all the years, but I think it's like insulting kind of to have a toy company"
01:21:03;01:21:08;"Like I feel like it's mean of the toy company to be like i'm a toy company, right?"
01:21:08;01:21:12;"And now I own your your like scary rap record label, right?"
01:21:12;01:21:15;"Because then it's like do you think they'd do like a mr. Potato head with tupac?"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"I hope"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"so mister"
01:21:19;01:21:25;"Like mr. Tupac head they'd be like the front tie bandana that you could just"
01:21:25;01:21:32;"Push onto his potato head. You can click on the bandana. Yeah, and then the tattoos could be like its own like"
01:21:32;01:21:36;"Yeah, those would go like right under the mouth. I guess that's where you're gonna put him"
01:21:36;01:21:42;"He doesn't really have a body. That's right. Oh, yeah, that's right. It would just be the they'd be face tattoos"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"It would be like yeah six nine or something, but then you can't really do that"
01:21:45;01:21:52;"No, that's even more disgraceful than being a toy company that bought death row is to put now put face tats"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"on mr. Potato"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"unfortunately"
01:21:57;01:22:00;"We're getting very far away from the original pock ip"
01:22:00;01:22:04;"Right at this point, you know, you can't yeah, this is like going back to the avengers"
01:22:04;01:22:11;"You know, you can't change tony stark's mask. You can't it's it gets very complicated. They probably do stuff like that though"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"Yeah, they do. Yeah"
01:22:13;01:22:15;"All right. Well, that's what I know you you got we're backstage"

01:26:20;01:26:22;"It seemed fairly obvious"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"Where madison square garden was but I remember"
01:26:24;01:26:28;"Being kind of confused about that anyway. Yeah. No, you know what? I agree"
01:26:28;01:26:33;"This is actually my first time here and to meet up with the crisis crew. Yeah, they were just like oh, yeah"
01:26:33;01:26:38;"Meet at msg. Yeah, and it took me like 25 minutes. I was like where it was like I was in circles"
01:26:38;01:26:43;"I was not playing with that. I saw the lobby call and I jumped in that van because right I knew"
01:26:43;01:26:49;"You know what? It was like it was like that seinfeld episode in the parking garage where they keep going around and around in circles"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Not knowing where they parked their car"
01:26:52;01:26:56;"If I can force that analogy in here, so well done. Thank you"
01:26:56;01:27:01;"Well, I can I could actually segue because while I was like lost in penn station tim hortons tim hortons"
01:27:01;01:27:06;"Okay, and it was you know what I got a picture of it actually which you can't know what the scandal is though"
01:27:06;01:27:10;"I know what tim hortons is so I saw a pizza hut slash nathan's"
01:27:10;01:27:15;"Slash tim hortons in penn station. That's crazy. That's a frankenstein's. That's a freakish"
01:27:15;01:27:22;"Combination right frankenstein's brings me back. I mean, sorry. Wow. Nathan's brings me back. Yeah"
01:27:22;01:27:24;"What is he brings me back to but?"
01:27:24;01:27:29;"To the first days of time crisis i've been mixing so there's no real scandal"
01:27:30;01:27:37;"It's just that sean mendes has done a big partnership with tim hortons. Get out of here. Oh, yeah, his face is on the cups"
01:27:37;01:27:43;"He's in the ads. Wow. He's instagramming about it. There's a tagline home is where the heart is"
01:27:43;01:27:50;"I mean, this is a major partnership ceramic versions of the sean mendes cup going for as much as 150"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"On the ebay. I did not know anything about that. That's very interesting"
01:27:53;01:28:00;"If you're sean mendes adjacent at all on instagram and you're swiping around you might see like a promoted sean mendes"
01:28:00;01:28:06;"Like very wholesome like drinking a coffee and like playing hockey. I haven't seen it. Yeah, you know sean mendes was at webster hall"
01:28:06;01:28:10;"I remember that. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We should have talked to him back then"
01:28:10;01:28:15;"I don't know was the tim hortons thing already happening. This is like I want to say about a month"
01:28:15;01:28:21;"We're about a month out now into the tim hortons thing. Maybe he bought tim hortons. I mean, he's got that money now"
01:28:21;01:28:25;"I I think it's possible but and because why else I mean how much could they have possibly?"
01:28:26;01:28:32;"I mean tim hortons is the dunkin donuts of canada. So right. Okay, they do have that mendes money, too, right?"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"But he could be a stakeholder these celebrity endorsements, you know"
01:28:34;01:28:39;"They're much more of a partnership than they used to be. So I don't know that's interesting"
01:28:39;01:28:45;"I guess what i'm saying is does a sean mendes tim hortons partnership make tim hortons any more appealing to you?"
01:28:45;01:28:48;"Would you go? Ah, yeah, try that. I want that cup with sean mendes on it"
01:28:48;01:28:54;"It makes me want to dig a little deeper right? Can I make a hard turn? Yeah, let me are you the type of producer who?"
01:28:54;01:29:01;"Like nothing ever feels finished. You know, kanye was like editing pablo like after it came out. I do feel that way"
01:29:01;01:29:07;"I thought that was interesting. That was an interesting concept that you could just keep tweaking it, right?"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"Since it was never gonna be anywhere physically"
01:29:10;01:29:16;"As a consumer it made me a little nervous because every time I was like am I committing to this the way this sounds?"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"I'm gonna get some new verses"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"What's going on here? It made me a little anxious"
01:29:20;01:29:24;"Because it was new behavior. It was new listening behavior. I know and"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"as interesting"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"As things have gotten i'll just say that"
01:29:29;01:29:36;"That yeah, these things do seem like slightly unhealthy the idea that it could never it never has to be done"
01:29:36;01:29:39;"You know my question from that is then"
01:29:39;01:29:42;"Now that we've had like a summer a father of the bride. Yeah"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"Do you listen back and go?"
01:29:44;01:29:49;"I wish I'd you know made that drum sound a little quieter or I wish i'd put a little"
01:29:49;01:29:54;"I would definitely feel that way if I listened to it. Oh, it'll take me a couple years before"
01:29:54;01:29:59;"I can listen to it. Oh you walk away. You walk away. Oh, wow. Okay, that's probably healthy, right?"
01:29:59;01:30:01;"I turn my back every now and then you know"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"I was listening to"
01:30:04;01:30:10;"Sympathy at soundcheck. I was like I have some thoughts about how it sounds. Let me reference the record"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"and"
01:30:12;01:30:16;"Yeah, I felt good about it. I mean i'm yeah, i'm always gonna hear things right for sure. Yeah. Yeah"
01:30:16;01:30:20;"Right on. Yeah. All right, and I would keep changing it if"
01:30:21;01:30:25;"It could go on forever very rarely. Do you feel like that's it? It's done"
01:30:25;01:30:28;"I remember in the tribe called quest documentary. Did you see that?"
01:30:28;01:30:34;"I did and they talk about the label having to like wrestle the album out of q-tips hands because he would just never"
01:30:34;01:30:41;"Want to stop I don't remember that detail. It's it's so unremarkable to me because it's like just like obvious like yeah"
01:30:41;01:30:45;"Like it requires like a a hard deadline sort of"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"nuclear"
01:30:47;01:30:51;"Situation to finish something so right on I relate"
01:30:51;01:30:55;"All right, that's it. They got me. We got to get out of here because"
01:30:55;01:31:01;"Our boy's about to hit the stage. That's right vampire weekend's gonna go back on we'll check in a bit later. I know"
01:31:01;01:31:06;"I think I love you"
01:31:06;01:31:13;"But this prophecy of ours has come back dressed to kill"
01:31:13;01:31:20;"Three stones on a mountain three small holes in a field"
01:31:21;01:31:24;"You've given me the big dream"
01:31:24;01:31:27;"But you can't make it real"

01:31:57;01:31:59;"It feels like such a dream"
01:31:59;01:32:01;"An endless conversation"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Since 1917"

01:35:03;01:35:05;"I'm not sure"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I just wanna say thank you to"
01:35:07;01:35:09;"Time Crisis and"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Ezra for being like my"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"favorite musician ever and"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"just like bringing joy to my"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"life for like 10 years"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Cheating on, cheating on me"
01:35:19;01:35:21;"I've been cheating on, cheating on you"
01:35:21;01:35:23;"Good job on 100 first years"
01:35:23;01:35:25;"Ezzy, we love you"
01:35:25;01:35:27;"Ezzy"
01:36:11;01:36:12;"My name's Elizabeth."
01:36:12;01:36:15;"Elizabeth, can you describe in detail the hat that you're wearing, please?"
01:36:15;01:36:21;"Alright, so I'm wearing a hat that is incredibly representative of the Time Crisis community"
01:36:21;01:36:24;"and also its core values."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"That's right, all 11 of them I see, yeah."
01:36:26;01:36:30;"Okay, so we've got goldfish, we've got Diet Coke."
01:36:30;01:36:32;"I mean, this is the most exceptional hat I've ever seen."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"This show rules."
01:36:34;01:36:35;"Sweet..."
01:36:35;01:36:36;"Oh my God."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Oh wow, sweet, spicy, chilly."
01:36:38;01:36:40;"Reppin' Ezra's."
01:36:40;01:36:41;"Borgesian."
01:36:41;01:36:43;"This belongs in a museum, honestly."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"What is going on here?"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"Wow, what is the opposite of buff?"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"That's what this hat is right now."
01:36:49;01:36:50;"Congratulations."
01:36:50;01:36:51;"I think you win."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"This is the bucket hat of the night."
01:36:53;01:36:54;"Thank you so much."
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Thank you."
01:37:17;01:37:22;"Well, I just told my friend Isabel here that my wedding day is going to be some serious competition"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"because this is the best night of my life."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"Ezra, I love you so much."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"You're the most important man in my life right now."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"Thank you for everything you do."
01:38:02;01:38:09;"So, we are at the Starbucks in Times Square."
01:38:09;01:38:12;"It is the day after the MSG show."
01:38:12;01:38:17;"I'm standing with Ariel, Despot, and Winter."
01:38:17;01:38:20;"And we're going to go--"
01:38:20;01:38:21;"What?"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"We're going to a different Starbucks."
01:38:23;01:38:26;"Why? Is this because Winter prefers a different Starbucks?"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"We want to go Starbucking."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"We're celebrating your 15,000th visit to a Starbucks."
01:38:34;01:38:37;"Is this 15,001?"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"No, no."
01:38:38;01:38:39;"A couple of reasons."
01:38:39;01:38:44;"After I hit my 15,000th store, I hit 44 more in Peru."
01:38:44;01:38:48;"And then I took a red-eye flight from Lima to Houston without any sleep,"
01:38:48;01:38:54;"got into a rental car, and drove 1,800 miles so that I could hit as many other Starbucks on the way back to Rochester."
01:38:54;01:39:02;"So, I'm up to like 15,047, not counting three in Queens and Brooklyn that I'm going to hit tomorrow."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"Okay."
01:39:03;01:39:10;"And this wouldn't be 15,001 anyway because I've already been here, and I can only count a store once, obviously."
01:39:10;01:39:14;"So, for Despot here, who's never Starbucked, this could be his first."
01:39:14;01:39:16;"What are your rules, Despot?"
01:39:16;01:39:19;"What is your Starbucking rule, personally?"
01:39:19;01:39:30;"Uh, well, I mean I have been to at least 10 Starbucks in my life."
01:39:30;01:39:31;"Did you follow a procedure?"
01:39:31;01:39:32;"No."
01:39:32;01:39:33;"Most of the time, I didn't get anything."
01:39:33;01:39:38;"I think you have to have some kind of process if you want to call it Starbucking."
01:39:38;01:39:42;"I feel like most times I've ever been in a Starbucks, it was to use the bathroom and leave."
01:39:42;01:39:45;"So, maybe my rule is I got to use the bathroom."
01:39:45;01:39:46;"Maybe that's your rule."
01:39:46;01:39:49;"You're going to have a problem with some of the Starbucks in New York City, though."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"They don't all have bathrooms."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"So, you just pee on the floor."
01:39:53;01:39:57;"I mean, and you explain that you have a thing you're doing, and you have to do it."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"That it's an art project."
01:39:58;01:39:59;"Yeah."
01:39:59;01:40:00;"You can see it as an art project."
01:40:00;01:40:05;"Despot, if I get you a coffee, will you have some coffee?"
01:40:05;01:40:07;"I'll have a sip of it, yeah."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"All right. All right. Let's do it."
01:40:09;01:40:12;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"Fits your rules."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"Now we got our first obstacle here."
01:40:16;01:40:17;"The lines."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Lines."
01:40:18;01:40:24;"So, I got to 60 Starbucks in Peru in four days and six hours."
01:40:24;01:40:28;"If not for the lines, I probably would have hit 70."
01:40:28;01:40:33;"So, is this like, would you call this a long line or an average line?"
01:40:33;01:40:36;"You know what? For New York City, this is probably an average line."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"Okay. Not so bad."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"It's not so bad."
01:40:39;01:40:43;"If this were in Dubuque, Iowa, this would be a crazy line."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"Okay."
01:40:44;01:40:48;"So, what kind of coffee are you getting?"
01:40:48;01:40:52;"Okay. So, for me, it's not a rule."
01:40:52;01:40:57;"But for practical purposes, I will ask them for a sample of the drip coffee,"
01:40:57;01:41:00;"which is that coffee that you see with the sign right there."
01:41:00;01:41:04;"In the afternoons, it's typically only Pike Place Roast."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"As it is right now."
01:41:06;01:41:10;"Yeah. In the morning, they'll have a lighter roast, which is typically Veranda."
01:41:10;01:41:15;"And they'll also have a dark roast, which they rotate across different things."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"Sometimes they're promoting special coffees."
01:41:17;01:41:21;"Like, you see right now, they've got a Chiapas out there."
01:41:21;01:41:25;"They might be promoting that, and you might actually see that being brewed in the morning."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"I don't know. I wasn't here in the morning."
01:41:27;01:41:33;"But basically, because it's the cheapest, easiest thing, that's what I'm asking for a sample of."
01:41:33;01:41:34;"Okay."
01:41:34;01:41:39;"If I'm just straight up buying a coffee because for whatever reason I don't want to ask for a sample,"
01:41:39;01:41:45;"it could be a cappuccino, could be a latte, could be a macchiato."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"Typically, nothing fancier than that."
01:41:47;01:41:55;"Starbucks' biggest moneymaker is the frappuccino, which is just like calories out the wazoo."
01:41:55;01:41:58;"If you're a gym goer or health-conscious guy, you would never have one of those."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"It's candy."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"I try to stay away from those. Yeah, it's essentially candy."
01:42:01;01:42:08;"If you remember the episode where Ezra and Jake were talking about the egg white foam cloud macchiato."
01:42:08;01:42:09;"You remember that episode?"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Oh, yeah."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Yeah, that was crazy. That was like pure candy."
01:42:12;01:42:13;"I had like a couple sips of that."
01:42:13;01:42:18;"I was like, ""Oh, my God. I need to go run up three miles just to burn this off."""
01:42:18;01:42:22;"Okay. So we're going to do some health-conscious coffee."
01:42:22;01:42:26;"If you have just regular coffee and you don't put any sugar in it,"
01:42:26;01:42:30;"that's about health-conscious as you get if you're not worried about caffeine."
01:42:30;01:42:31;"Okay."
01:42:31;01:42:32;"Some people are."
01:42:32;01:42:39;"Right. So, okay. So what would you order for me if you had free reign?"
01:42:39;01:42:47;"Honestly, for a person who doesn't drink coffee, you need to start with just a regular drip coffee, no sugar."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"Just taste it, see how you like it, and work up from there."
01:42:50;01:42:51;"No sugar, no milk."
01:42:51;01:42:54;"Yeah, it depends. Do you have a sweet tooth?"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"I don't know."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"I have a crazy sweet tooth."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"I never met a sugary beverage or a sugary pastry that I didn't like."
01:43:00;01:43:01;"Okay."
01:43:01;01:43:02;"I'm never going to be diesel like you."
01:43:02;01:43:03;"Right."
01:43:03;01:43:05;"But I'm comfortable in my own skin."
01:43:05;01:43:10;"You could eat all types of crazy sweets and still just got to sweat that out."
01:43:10;01:43:14;"Yeah. Well, honestly, if I cut out all the sugar, I wouldn't have this gut here."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"But, I mean, what are you going to do?"
01:43:16;01:43:18;"We don't all have the same level of self-discipline."
01:43:18;01:43:21;"The narcissism of small differences."
01:43:21;01:43:26;"Despot is about to have his first taste of Starbucks coffee."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"You probably want to take the lid off."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"Yeah. I was going to do it through the little hole."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"No, no. You can't. That's not pure."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"You got to sip it like that."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"You think this is, like, really hot? Is it going to--"
01:43:38;01:43:44;"Starbucks coffee is notoriously hot, so, you know, just take a little sip first to see if it's too hot for you."
01:43:44;01:43:47;"There was a lawsuit from, like, 15 years ago."
01:43:47;01:43:49;"Oh, someone spilled it on their cracker."
01:43:49;01:43:52;"Yeah, I think a grandma or something like that, or she might have been McDonald's."
01:43:52;01:43:57;"But there was a Starbucks lawsuit over the temperature of the coffee."
01:43:57;01:44:02;"I mean, it's as gross as I remember coffee being."
01:44:02;01:44:05;"Actually, no, no, Despot, I'm going to say this quietly."
01:44:05;01:44:13;"It's probably grosser than you remember because it is Starbucks, and they are not, in my opinion, a coffee company."
01:44:13;01:44:20;"They are a customer service company that happens to sell coffee, and that's the distinction that a lot of people do not realize."
01:44:20;01:44:25;"And your high regard for them is for the customer service."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"Absolutely."
01:44:27;01:44:34;"Most places you will go, Starbucks partners are impeccably trained in customer service."
01:44:34;01:44:38;"Why do people drink coffee? It's insane. It's just so bad."
01:44:38;01:44:40;"I'm a computer programmer, and I survive on coffee."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"I was a computer programmer for a time."
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Oh, nice."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"That's what I went to college for."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"All right. What did you program in? Did you ever do C++?"
01:44:47;01:44:48;"C++."
01:44:48;01:44:49;"Nice."
01:44:49;01:44:51;"I did Perl, C++, JavaScript."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Beautiful."
01:44:52;01:44:56;"I never even did ActionScript because I was doing it in the moment when people did that. Nobody does that."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"I never even heard of ActionScript."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"It's like the flash programming language."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Wow. Wow."
01:45:01;01:45:06;"Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form."
01:45:06;01:45:11;"All right, guys. This has been a truly memorable experience, certainly for me."
01:45:11;01:45:13;"I hope for both of you guys."
01:45:13;01:45:27;"We are going to go check back in with Jake and Ezra and sort of wrap up this Vampire Weekend 100 years of time crisis special weekend."
01:45:27;01:45:30;"It really has been a weekend. So thanks, guys."
01:45:30;01:45:31;"Thank you."
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Hey, it's been great talking to Despot."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"It's been great Starbucks-ing with Despot."
01:45:35;01:45:36;"Likewise."
01:45:36;01:45:37;"Let's do it again."
01:45:37;01:45:38;"Yes."
01:45:54;01:45:58;"Do you feel like a chain store?"
01:45:58;01:46:02;"Practically floored."
01:46:02;01:46:10;"One of many zeros kicked around four."
01:46:10;01:46:14;"Your ears are full but you're empty."
01:46:14;01:46:27;"Holding out your heart to people who never really care how you are."
01:46:27;01:46:35;"So give me coffee and tea, please, hurry."
01:46:35;01:46:43;"I've seen so much I'm going blind and I'm blaming virtually."
01:46:43;01:46:51;"The social reality is hard enough for me."
01:46:51;01:47:00;"Take me away from this big bad world and agree to marry me."
01:47:00;01:47:06;"So we can start over again."
01:47:06;01:47:13;"Now let's go into the time crisis hotline."
01:47:13;01:47:14;"Hey, Jake."
01:47:14;01:47:20;"By the way, if you guys forgot, Jake couldn't make it out to the MSG show, but we will see him at the Hollywood Bowl."
01:47:20;01:47:23;"We're going to talk via the phone right now."
01:47:23;01:47:24;"Where are you?"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"I'm backstage at Town Hall."
01:47:26;01:47:27;"Right."
01:47:27;01:47:28;"So you guys are playing there tonight?"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"It's a Minnesota public radio show."
01:47:30;01:47:32;"I actually have a few more questions about it."
01:47:32;01:47:34;"Obviously, we're here in Manhattan."
01:47:34;01:47:40;"I was just talking to the kind of stage manager dude wearing a Minnesota public radio polo shirt."
01:47:40;01:47:43;"And he's like, ""All right, man. Here's how it's going to go. No cursing, bro."""
01:47:43;01:47:48;"And I was kind of like, ""Wait, people just commuting from Minnesota to the city?"""
01:47:48;01:47:53;"But anyway, it's called Live From Here, and I think it's in the vein of like Prairie Home Companion."
01:47:53;01:47:58;"The host is this guy, Chris Thile, who's like a virtuoso mandolinist."
01:47:58;01:48:02;"He's kind of like regarded as the best mandolin player in the world, and he's like incredible."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Whoa."
01:48:03;01:48:07;"And they do a mix of music, performance, and conversation."
01:48:07;01:48:12;"So it's like there's some other musicians on the bill, like Jake Gyllenhaal is on the bill."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"I don't know if he's getting interviewed or like doing a dramatic reading or something."
01:48:15;01:48:20;"So it's been like a bit of a whirlwind, but everybody was like, ""Just pick some Vampire Weekend songs."
01:48:20;01:48:27;"The live band is like unbelievable shredders. You come in for 40 minutes, run it with them, make some notes, and that's that."""
01:48:27;01:48:35;"So it's like we're doing like a kind of slightly more Americana Harmony Hall and Sunflower, where he's playing it on mandolin."
01:48:35;01:48:39;"And it's a cool kind of variety show, I guess."
01:48:39;01:48:42;"So is it only you from Vampire who's appearing?"
01:48:42;01:48:45;"Yeah, it's just me sitting. It's basically me sitting in with their house band."
01:48:45;01:48:47;"Oh, wow. Sick."
01:48:47;01:48:51;"Yeah, so then it's like, you know, I just heard them. They were like running some downstairs."
01:48:51;01:48:59;"They're like running a Graham Parsons song, and I'm just like, yeah, it's going to be interesting because I've heard about the show, but I've never taken all in."
01:48:59;01:49:02;"I guess it's live on the radio, and then I'm sure you can listen to it later."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"This is the official kind of continuation of Prairie Home, I think, right?"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Oh, it is the official? Okay. Yeah, Matt's nodding."
01:49:08;01:49:10;"I'm pretty sure. Yeah."
01:49:10;01:49:13;"Okay, yeah, because I kept being like, oh, it sounds like Prairie Home Companion."
01:49:13;01:49:17;"Okay, this is Prairie Home Companion 2019. Live from here."
01:49:17;01:49:18;"Very cool."
01:49:18;01:49:23;"None of that specific regional Prairie **** anymore. Just live from here."
01:49:23;01:49:25;"The generalized here."
01:49:25;01:49:32;"This sounds cool. It sounds like almost like a kind of like Garcia Grissom, Folded in a Way style version."
01:49:32;01:49:39;"Yeah, yeah, totally. And I was thinking too, like, you know, so you know how like Married in a Gold Rush on the record, you know, it's like a country song,"
01:49:39;01:49:45;"but then the drums have like kind of like this African flavor and you know, it's like it's a whole genre mix."
01:49:45;01:49:50;"And then we were playing it here. I was like, let's just go like full Americana, you know, because they have like a Chris on mandolin."
01:49:50;01:49:55;"They have like a shredder violinist. And so they did it just like real rootsy and I was just loving it."
01:49:55;01:50:04;"Wow, I'm just like to hear that. Also, speaking of like cool multi hyphenate, like radio host slash virtuoso mandolin player."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"He's an American mandolinist and radio personality."
01:50:07;01:50:15;"It's funny. It's like anytime he comes up with music people. I mean, I've seen him play and I'm like, oh, yeah, he's really, really good."
01:50:15;01:50:19;"But then people are like, there are three great mandolinists of the past hundred years."
01:50:19;01:50:23;"Jerry Douglas, this other dude who had a different flat picking technique."
01:50:23;01:50:28;"And then you have Chris Thiele, who's a master of both. It's like we talk about like Kung Fu or something."
01:50:28;01:50:34;"It's like there was a Shaolin master in a Wu-Tang master and nobody ever thought somebody could master both."
01:50:34;01:50:43;"And then this young gun came out. And yes, if he like really looms large and even just playing with him for a second, I was like, oh, damn, this dude is serious."
01:50:43;01:50:48;"Well, dude, I guess a congratulations is in order. MSG, dog, how was it?"
01:50:48;01:50:57;"You know what? It was really good. The funny thing is, is like often when it's like the big show, whatever that might be, you know, like big slot at a huge festival,"
01:50:57;01:51:06;"headlining something, the big major market event. I'm always like walking off stage being kind of like bewildered and like, was that good?"
01:51:06;01:51:11;"I don't know. Yeah. Like I just do always feel like kind of alienated in like the really big cities."
01:51:11;01:51:24;"Even in New York's funny because the hometown show. But that also brings like stress because I'm like walking on stage being like, oh, my God, did I not give enough pluses to, you know, that person I've known for 20 years on the guest list?"
01:51:24;01:51:32;"Wow. Again, as I've said before, I love touring the Midwest. It's like when we're like in the Midwest, I just feel in my element like here to perform."
01:51:32;01:51:39;"Don't really have any family out there or anything. I'm just like I'm here to perform, to connect, always have like great crowds."
01:51:39;01:51:52;"And New York is like a famously disloyal town in the music industry. I was talking to some big wig like touring dude, the kind of people who are like all they do is like look at ticket numbers and just be like, that's up, that's down."
01:51:52;01:51:57;"That market's hot. That venue's cooling off. And we're talking about like New York. And I was like, yeah, you know, New York's like our hometown."
01:51:57;01:52:04;"So it's always, you know, it feels high stress. And he was like, yeah. And you know what? It is high stress because New York is a very disloyal market."
01:52:04;01:52:10;"And I was like, but, you know, it's like the biggest city in the country. He's like, even so, I'll bring an act over, you know, one tour."
01:52:10;01:52:18;"They're doing it's huge in New York. They come back. They're doing the same kind of numbers in Texas. And New York fell off a cliff. Not a loyal town."
01:52:18;01:52:24;"And I was like, well, hopefully there's a little more loyalty, like when you're from there. But it was funny, like the way this dude was talking."
01:52:24;01:52:32;"So there's a part of me that was kind of like, and honestly, our last big New York show was 2013 at Barclays. And I didn't walk off stage feeling great."
01:52:32;01:52:40;"I was like, this venue didn't feel right for us. It felt like maybe we're just not a band that belongs in arenas. Was that good? I had all those questions."
01:52:40;01:52:54;"And this time, I think it's partially because we did the 360 seating. I got to send you some pictures. I was talking about that before, how it's like by doing 360, you open up another 6,000 tickets, which can be hard to sell because people can be like, I don't know if I want to sit behind the stage."
01:52:54;01:53:03;"But actually, I think those seats were actually sick. And anyway, the garden is just a great spot. It weirdly feels like cozy, even though it's huge."
01:53:03;01:53:14;"That's awesome, dude. I was gonna text you yesterday, just like kind of like, hey, man, break a leg. And I was like, you know what, I don't want to get in this grill. And there's a million things going on."
01:53:14;01:53:19;"Don't want to burden the man with, you know, some sort of obligatory reply."
01:53:19;01:53:23;"I'm about to go on stage. Hold on, guys. What the f*** is Jay doing?"
01:53:23;01:53:27;"Yeah, yeah, like you're about to go on stage and I'm just like, hey, man."
01:53:27;01:53:34;"No, but you know, situations like that, you send a good spirit, a kind thought, send it into the universe. We felt it, you know."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"That's tight, man."
01:53:35;01:53:42;"Yeah, but considering that there's so much like stress about being in New York, you know, like Van Ferrogen guest list in New York is absurd."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Oh my God."
01:53:43;01:53:52;"Somebody told me a funny story about what, 38 special. But I forget where they're from, like Jacksonville or Gainesville. They're from, you know, a city in Florida."
01:53:52;01:53:59;"And it's like whatever town it was, they're like when 38 special, you know, plays their hometown, guest list, 3000 people."
01:53:59;01:54:05;"Just like everybody they ever knew. Just like, oh, gee, 38 special fans."
01:54:05;01:54:12;"It's not quite 3000 people, but it's like, it's just a lot, you know, and it's like family and cousins and really old friends and stuff."
01:54:12;01:54:17;"So do you have any idea how big the guest list was numerically?"
01:54:17;01:54:24;"Well, I kept being told that there were 19,000 people in the building, which makes it the biggest Vampire Weekend show ever."
01:54:24;01:54:29;"But I know we sold closer to 18,000 tickets or maybe even slightly less."
01:54:29;01:54:35;"So because at the garden you have the artist guest list, then you have just like the venue itself."
01:54:35;01:54:38;"The garden gives people tickets and the promoter and stuff."
01:54:38;01:54:48;"So easily when you consider all the kind of comps and guest list and then probably like weird special stuff, like the after party was in the Delta Lounge, which looks like an airport."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"That was hilarious."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"What was the curfew situation?"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"It was mellower than I thought."
01:54:54;01:55:01;"I thought it was a hard 11 curfew, but then we found out, no, like it's cool if you play up to like 1120 ish."
01:55:01;01:55:07;"And we went on like 10 minutes late because, you know, sometimes at those big venues, they're just like, they have it in real time."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"So they're just like only 60% of the audience is seated."
01:55:10;01:55:12;"If you give another 10 minutes, you know, like that kind of thing."
01:55:12;01:55:23;"So the curfew was mellower than I thought because, and I'm glad because we had time to take three requests in the encore, which just barely put this show into our most songs ever."
01:55:23;01:55:27;"For a regular show, Chicago's 31 songs."
01:55:27;01:55:28;"This is 32."
01:55:28;01:55:32;"Wait, so you were taking requests just like whoever was in the front shouting out songs?"
01:55:32;01:55:36;"We take requests basically every show now just as a way to switch it up."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"So yeah, it's mostly from the front."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"We got some from the side."
01:55:39;01:55:43;"There were these people up front who requested Obvious Bicycle."
01:55:43;01:55:49;"And at first I was like, oh man, all right, is that going to be kind of like a slow let down?"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Like, do we need to build the energy up?"
01:55:50;01:55:54;"But I was like, all right, and then we did it and did our thing where we like go into Son of a Preacher Man."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"And actually that was like a really strong moment in the show."
01:55:56;01:55:59;"So shout out to the people who requested Obvious Bicycle."
01:55:59;01:56:04;"Wait, so can you play every song in the catalog at the drop of a hat?"
01:56:04;01:56:05;"Almost every song."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"We've had a couple of times where people requested the song Hudson."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"Do you know that song?"
01:56:09;01:56:10;"It's on Modern Vampires."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"Oh yeah."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"It's like the kind of minor key."
01:56:13;01:56:15;"Second to last track, I think."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"Outside of that, just about every song."
01:56:18;01:56:23;"Most requested song so far in the store, Ottoman from the Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist soundtrack."
01:56:23;01:56:25;"That was requested last night."
01:56:25;01:56:27;"Dude, I don't know if I even know that song."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"It's a good song."
01:56:28;01:56:29;"There's a rap version."
01:56:29;01:56:32;"Kid Cudi sampled it from like a mix tape."
01:56:32;01:56:34;"It opens with a guitar riff that goes..."
01:56:34;01:56:41;"Okay, yeah, I think I kind of remember that from live shows."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"Not an album track."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"No, yeah, definitely a deep cut."
01:56:44;01:56:46;"I wrote that guitar riff when I was a sophomore in high school."
01:56:46;01:56:50;"That's my national anthem bass line from Radiohead."
01:56:50;01:56:51;"Wow."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"You'll do that, man."
01:56:52;01:56:57;"I feel like that's come up before on the show where you had this riff around for 15 years."
01:56:57;01:57:03;"I still have one or two high school riffs or middle school riffs that I always keep trying to turn into a song."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"You know, maybe one day."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"That's wild."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"There's still some leftovers."
01:57:08;01:57:11;"Did you see any of those Jake Longstaff Wikipedia page shirts?"
01:57:11;01:57:15;"I didn't see any in the crowd, but actually, multiple times during the show,"
01:57:15;01:57:22;"like right-- like stage right, there was a dude in the front row side stage wearing a Richard Pictures shirt."
01:57:22;01:57:24;"Oh, that's sick."
01:57:24;01:57:31;"Basically, every Vampire Weekend show, I at least see one Richard Pictures shirt or the Ezra and Jake Longsleeve."
01:57:31;01:57:32;"Oh, right, the Ben and Jerry's one?"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"Yeah."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"Oh, my God."
01:57:34;01:57:40;"The crew of the two women up front who requested Obvious Bicycle, they both had these homemade hats,"
01:57:40;01:57:45;"and one of them said, ""Is this still sunflower?"" which is kind of like a fish reference."
01:57:45;01:57:50;"The other one had like a bucket hat that said, ""Bring the buff on it."""
01:57:50;01:57:53;"I stumbled across that From the Freezer Insta account."
01:57:53;01:57:55;"Oh, yeah, everybody got a follow From the Freezer."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"Somebody--"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"Yeah, that site is--"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"It's bananas."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"Yeah, that account is crazy."
01:58:00;01:58:02;"It's basically-- and it's great."
01:58:02;01:58:04;"I was actually like always wanted there to be something like this."
01:58:04;01:58:06;"I'm glad somebody started it."
01:58:06;01:58:13;"They're compiling all of the Time Crisis Vampire Weekend and Richard Pictures merch official and especially unofficial."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Like one-offs."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"A lot of homemade stuff, hand-painted."
01:58:17;01:58:18;"Yeah."
01:58:18;01:58:21;"Yeah, but the Jake Wikipedia shirt is classic."
01:58:21;01:58:23;"That's truly one of my faves."
01:58:23;01:58:24;"I know."
01:58:24;01:58:31;"I feel like I need to get a copy of that shirt, but I don't think I can wear it, but I need it for posterity."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"Oh, my God."
01:58:32;01:58:36;"Just you rolling a coffee bean in that shirt."
01:58:36;01:58:39;"Everybody's like, ""Who's Jake Longstreth?"""
01:58:39;01:58:42;"Wait, ""Who's John Jake Pullman Longstreth?"""
01:58:42;01:58:46;"And you're like, ""It's me, bro."""
01:58:46;01:58:50;"Anyway, whoever made that shirt, if you're listening, at least send Jake one."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"Right."
01:58:51;01:58:54;"Put it on a mannequin in your living room."
01:58:54;01:58:57;"All right, they're saying we got to jump off because we got to--"
01:58:57;01:58:59;"I think all of the guests share one dressing room here."
01:58:59;01:59:00;"It's real showbiz."
01:59:00;01:59:01;"All right, but--"
01:59:01;01:59:05;"It's real old-school showbiz, like cabaret kind of vibe."
01:59:05;01:59:06;"That's cool."
01:59:06;01:59:09;"I'm psyched to hear this set you're going to do."
01:59:09;01:59:11;"Have fun with the last show on the blag."
01:59:11;01:59:13;"I'll see you back in L.A. soon, bud."
01:59:13;01:59:14;"All right."
01:59:14;01:59:15;"Thanks, dude."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"Episode 100."
01:59:16;01:59:17;"All right."
01:59:17;01:59:18;"I'll see you for 101."
01:59:18;01:59:19;"All right."
01:59:19;01:59:20;"Peace."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"All right."
01:59:21;01:59:22;"Peace."
01:59:22;01:59:23;"Thanks for listening, guys."
01:59:23;01:59:26;"We'll see you next week, and I'm really starting to get excited about episode 1,000."
01:59:26;01:59:28;"So let's keep that energy going."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"Time Crisis with Eds Rukh Kagan."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
01:59:34;01:59:38;"Time Crisis."
01:59:38;01:59:40;"This is the Time Crisis."
01:59:40;01:59:41;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:59:41;01:59:44;"Sweet Chili Heat, world premiere, brought to you by Doritos."
01:59:44;01:59:45;"Sweet Chili Heat."
01:59:45;01:59:49;"I'm a vibe guy."
01:59:49;01:59:54;"But in my neighborhood--"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"Old Town Road was a hit that was infinite."
01:59:57;01:59:59;"Jeff Epstein made me sick."
01:59:59;02:00:04;"It's still pretty neat talking all rock beefs in the summer, in the summer."
02:00:04;02:00:07;"I like TC heads wearing bootleg merch."
02:00:07;02:00:13;"So go and do your own research and meet back here for another TC summer."
02:00:13;02:00:16;"2019, man, I'll never forget."
