00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back again."
00:02;00:06;"We're once again joined by Dave Longstreth."
00:06;00:10;"We'll also talk to Wes Miles."
00:10;00:13;"We're digging in the crates."
00:13;00:15;"Music from 90s Connecticut,"
00:15;00:18;"early 2000s New Jersey,"
00:18;00:20;"and so much more."
00:20;00:24;"This is part two of our Youth and Young Manhood conference."
00:24;00:25;"On..."
00:25;00:27;"Time Crisis"
00:27;00:29;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:35;"They passed me by"
00:35;00:38;"All of those great romances"
00:38;00:42;"You were a pelt from beneath"
00:42;00:45;"All my rightful chances"
00:45;00:48;"My picture clear"
00:48;00:53;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:53;00:56;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:56;00:59;"When a bus had to go"
00:59;01:04;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:04;01:07;"One of us is crying"
01:07;01:10;"One of us is lying"
01:10;01:14;"Keep an only man"
01:14;01:17;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:17;01:19;"Another banked up."
01:19;01:22;"Dave Longstreth is still here hanging out."
01:22;01:26;"So I was saying on our last episode how"
01:26;01:30;"one Vampire Weekend song that has some of the oldest roots"
01:30;01:35;"is the song Ottoman because I essentially wrote that riff when I was 15."
01:35;01:39;"And this, anybody who doesn't know, this is how Ottoman Vampire Weekend song sounds."
01:41;01:52;"Before the Vampire Weekend era where I was playing,"
01:52;01:54;"started playing stuff more like plucky and high"
01:54;01:56;"[singing]"
01:56;01:57;"It was more like low."
01:57;01:59;"[singing]"
01:59;02:06;"A little more indie, actually."
02:06;02:07;"A little more 90s."
02:07;02:08;"Sludgier."
02:08;02:09;"A little sludgier."
02:09;02:14;"So I believe it was originally called The Telephone Song."
02:14;02:17;"And this is another song where it's like..."
02:17;02:19;"So are we still in 2000 here?"
02:19;02:20;"Yeah, I would say we're still in 2000."
02:20;02:23;"So you're 15, 16."
02:23;02:27;"And I think we all had fun making up song titles and stuff,"
02:27;02:30;"but just very deeply uninterested in lyrics."
02:30;02:32;"Didn't really know how to do it, wasn't that important."
02:32;02:35;"I feel like it was really, I think a flip switch,"
02:35;02:39;"probably when I was like 19, maybe like 18, actually 18."
02:39;02:41;"Because I remember my freshman year of high school,"
02:41;02:43;"or my freshman year of college, finally I was like,"
02:43;02:45;"write a song and just something,"
02:45;02:49;"I kind of knew how to vaguely write something that went together"
02:49;02:53;"and I started to enjoy thinking more about verse one versus verse two"
02:53;02:54;"and all this stuff."
02:54;02:55;"Yeah, I didn't care."
02:55;02:58;"So this is, I guess this is the demo of Telephone Song,"
02:58;03:01;"the original, the original Ottoman."
03:01;03:09;"[playing]"
03:10;03:12;"[playing]"
03:12;03:25;"Yeah, this is way more indie."
03:25;03:26;"Yeah."
03:26;03:38;"Dan Millar on other guitar, playing the arpeggios."
03:38;03:40;"[playing]"
03:40;03:44;"Like, Young Marble Giants or something."
03:44;03:48;"Are there vocals on this?"
03:48;03:53;"Alright, so that was like the demo,"
03:53;03:55;"but this is like live recordings."
03:55;03:57;"This is by us in the church basement."
03:57;04:04;"This song's about, it's about lost love in the age of technology"
04:04;04:06;"and you want to make a dance."
04:06;04:09;"Similar sense of humor to 90s man."
04:09;04:11;"Picture like probably playing like 15 kids,"
04:11;04:14;"be like, uh, this song's about lost love in the age of technology."
04:14;04:16;"[laughing]"
04:16;04:19;"Was that Wes or was that you?"
04:19;04:20;"That was me."
04:20;04:21;"That was you? It didn't sound like you."
04:21;04:22;"That's interesting."
04:22;04:25;"Oh yeah, almost more like baritone than you are now."
04:25;04:27;"Yeah, lower than your voice is now."
04:27;04:29;"Like kind of a Jonathan Richman vibe."
04:29;04:33;"Yeah, I think we all really like Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers."
04:34;04:36;"[playing]"
04:36;04:47;"Pixies."
04:47;04:48;"Yeah, a little pixies."
04:48;04:49;"Oh right."
04:49;04:51;"Rap? Is that a rap?"
04:51;04:52;"Might be."
04:52;04:55;"That's Dan playing those parts."
04:55;04:58;"[playing]"
04:59;05:01;"[playing]"
05:01;05:07;"See, it's like I was saying,"
05:07;05:09;"there's something about when we do rock songs,"
05:09;05:14;"I just didn't quite know what I wanted to say in the rock idiom yet."
05:14;05:18;"But yeah, I felt like when we were making our little fake Kid A songs and stuff,"
05:18;05:23;"that's when we were kind of figuring out more like having more fun."
05:23;05:26;"Jake was like very good at writing"
05:26;05:32;"different like 90s drop D style riffs."
05:32;05:33;"Hmm."
05:33;05:35;"Dribble lyrics up."
05:35;05:36;"This is your music, older."
05:36;05:37;"Yeah."
05:37;05:39;"[playing]"
05:39;05:42;"Yeah, this is super Kid A."
05:42;05:43;"A lot of this kind of stuff."
05:43;05:46;"This is cool. This is like a cool aesthetic."
05:46;05:47;"Hanging in the basement."
05:47;05:49;"[playing]"
05:53;05:54;"Yeah, it's funny."
05:54;05:58;"All these recordings must be basically like a two and a half year period."
05:58;06:01;"And yet I can totally hear like these different moments."
06:01;06:03;"We must have started listening to something new."
06:03;06:06;"Or just like, you know, that's like a big deal at the time,"
06:06;06:07;"like sophomore year versus junior year."
06:07;06:08;"Oh yeah."
06:08;06:15;"So like I kind of remember this song being a bit of a breakthrough."
06:15;06:17;"This song's really dumb."
06:17;06:19;"Called Great Expectations."
06:19;06:21;"But I remember kind of like listening to this one and being like,"
06:21;06:23;"oh, this one had a little more personality."
06:23;06:25;"So I feel like this is like junior year."
06:25;06:26;"Maybe like 16."
06:26;06:27;"Okay."
06:27;06:28;"Now time for that."
06:28;06:30;"[playing]"
06:30;06:32;"Live."
06:32;06:33;"Studio recording."
06:33;06:34;"Live in the basement."
06:34;06:36;"[playing]"
06:36;06:38;"Wait, Wes, look at that red--"
06:38;06:41;"Wait, did you multi-track or just record live in the studio?"
06:41;06:42;"Probably live on this one."
06:42;06:43;"All right, this is a spoken intro."
06:43;06:44;"Everyone clap your hands."
06:44;06:46;"[clapping]"
06:46;06:48;"[laughing]"
06:49;06:53;"All right, this song is going to be called--"
06:53;06:56;"No, I'm not going to call it that."
06:56;06:59;"Yeah."
06:59;07:03;"Great expectations."
07:03;07:06;"Great expectations."
07:06;07:07;"Very Jonathan Richman."
07:07;07:08;"Great expectations."
07:08;07:11;"Yeah, maybe Jonathan Richman was the biggest influence."
07:11;07:12;"Great expectations."
07:12;07:15;"So you were--you loved Jonathan Richman in high school."
07:15;07:17;"Yeah, that's another Andre thing though."
07:17;07:20;"Yeah, actually, when I think about it, I was like 14,"
07:20;07:25;"me, this kind of like cool 17-year-old dude with long blonde hair,"
07:25;07:27;"and he was just like--yeah, his favorite records were like"
07:27;07:31;"Marquis Moon and Modern Lovers."
07:31;07:32;"That was tight."
07:32;07:33;"That was the intro."
07:33;07:35;"Wait, wait, this part sounds pretty--"
07:35;07:37;"It just like cuts to this part."
07:37;07:41;"[playing]"
07:41;07:42;"Yeah."
07:42;07:45;"Look at this classic Steve garage rock here."
07:45;07:46;"Yeah."
07:46;07:47;"What year is this?"
07:47;07:49;"2000 or 2001."
07:49;07:54;"Great expectations."
07:54;07:56;"Yeah, this is sick."
07:56;08:01;"Great expectations."
08:01;08:04;"I think this is also a good example of how like the earlier stuff"
08:04;08:09;"is like trying to write like sophisticated sounding--like you're 14 or 15"
08:09;08:14;"trying to do sophisticated stuff, then you're like 16 and you do dumber stuff."
08:14;08:15;"Yeah."
08:15;08:17;"And it actually helps you unlock something."
08:17;08:18;"Yep."
08:18;08:27;"[playing]"
08:27;08:31;"Also, what makes me think like there's like this reference to like the famous"
08:31;08:34;"Charles Dickens book, which seems kind of vampire."
08:34;08:35;"Yeah, yeah, very."
08:35;08:37;"Play around with like a famous title."
08:37;08:38;"Totally."
08:38;08:39;"Collegiate."
08:39;08:43;"[playing]"
08:43;08:45;"I would like to work on this song."
08:45;08:48;"I feel like there's some meat on the bone here."
08:48;08:55;"Expectations."
08:55;08:57;"And it's just the phrase."
08:57;09:03;"[playing]"
09:03;09:12;"Expectations."
09:12;09:17;"Expectations."
09:17;09:21;"I love the thing about his parents upstairs."
09:21;09:22;"What is this song?"
09:22;09:23;"Great expectations."
09:23;09:24;"I like that."
09:24;09:26;"I think they're reading it in English class."
09:26;09:34;"[playing]"
09:34;09:36;"I love that noisy organ."
09:36;09:37;"Totally."
09:37;09:50;"Yeah, this one has a good vibe."
09:50;09:55;"Yeah, always super sloppy."
09:55;09:56;"Hell yeah."
09:56;10:00;"Yeah."
10:00;10:05;"I think that, I mean, that's an interesting idea, like doing the simpler stuff"
10:05;10:07;"and then not unlocking something."
10:07;10:11;"Yeah, as I say it, I realize that that was such like a huge transition,"
10:11;10:14;"because like I could totally picture, yeah, trying,"
10:14;10:20;"listening to like the best side of 90s rock, like Nirvana or, weird ending."
10:20;10:21;"That's not the--"
10:21;10:26;"Nirvana or Pavement or whatever, and just being like too young,"
10:26;10:28;"just like you can kind of tell that it's cool,"
10:28;10:33;"but like it's either too serious or even like too ironic or something."
10:33;10:37;"Like you're just too young and like you try to do it and it's like this wack copy."
10:37;10:39;"Yeah, and then just doing something so simple."
10:39;10:42;"I think there's also something about that too, just like you repeat one word."
10:42;10:43;"I know I like that."
10:43;10:45;"I know it's cool to me."
10:45;10:48;"Great, great expectations."
10:48;10:52;"This is, I guess there must have been a whole run of like English class songs,"
10:52;10:57;"also pretty vampire, because I found this one called Odysseus."
10:57;10:58;"[playing]"
10:58;11:02;"So this I feel like I'm probably like--"
11:02;11:03;"This sounds like Jimmy."
11:03;11:05;"About to turn 17."
11:05;11:06;"[playing]"
11:06;11:08;"Odysseus."
11:08;11:10;"[playing]"
11:10;11:11;"Doing like Lou Reed."
11:11;11:12;"Lou Reed."
11:12;11:13;"Delivery."
11:13;11:15;"[playing]"
11:15;11:16;"Wow."
11:16;11:19;"Yeah, it's kind of like a Basement Teams vibe."
11:19;11:24;"[playing]"
11:24;11:26;"Scylla and Charybdis, the two monsters."
11:26;11:27;"And Charybdis."
11:27;11:28;"Charybdis."
11:28;11:30;"[playing]"
11:30;11:33;"So you were into Lou Reed in high school?"
11:33;11:34;"In the Velvets?"
11:34;11:36;"I did not know that stuff at all."
11:36;11:39;"Yeah, by this time, but also now I'm 17 probably."
11:39;11:43;"This could be 2001, like people starting to know who the Strokes were."
11:43;11:49;"[playing]"
11:49;11:51;"A lot of short songs, still love short songs."
11:51;11:53;"This is some real goofy, goofy thing."
11:53;11:56;"One, two, three, four."
11:56;12:08;"[playing]"
12:08;12:13;"My master's nip is Stephanie and tying me down."
12:13;12:14;"A little bit of shanty."
12:14;12:17;"He runs me round and makes me kiss."
12:17;12:19;"Always doing these weird voices."
12:19;12:22;"Quite literally not having a voice yet."
12:22;12:35;"[playing]"
12:35;12:37;"Who are you thinking of?"
12:37;12:39;"We probably thought this was just funny."
12:39;12:40;"It is funny."
12:40;12:42;"We're saying, ""Salmonella poisoning."""
12:42;12:45;"[playing]"
12:45;12:47;"I think that's a guy at our school's name is Alex Ng."
12:47;12:57;"[playing]"
12:57;13:00;"And then it's funny, there's all these side projects and stuff."
13:00;13:01;"Oh yeah, dude."
13:01;13:04;"Me, Wes, and Andre had a side project called ""Rickshaw's Dead."""
13:04;13:06;"[playing]"
13:06;13:09;"This is also very much like what I like."
13:09;13:11;"Liking old-fashioned stuff."
13:11;13:27;"[playing]"
13:27;13:33;"We have so many of these surf instrumentals hanging in the basement."
13:33;13:36;"I think probably I was very inspired by, as I said in the last episode,"
13:36;13:38;"the Fender Twin."
13:38;13:39;"Yeah."
13:39;13:47;"[playing]"
13:47;13:51;"Yeah, because of the Pulp Fiction soundtrack, I got super into Dick Dale."
13:51;13:53;"Oh yeah, amazing."
13:53;13:54;"Yeah, I was always trying to play that."
13:54;14:04;"[playing]"
14:04;14:09;"This also reminds me a lot of WFMU, which we grew up listening to."
14:09;14:12;"It's where Tom Sharpling and the Best Show first started."
14:12;14:15;"But it was the local radio, so you'd just always hear these shows"
14:15;14:18;"of dudes that'd be playing garage and surf constantly."
14:18;14:20;"Right."
14:20;14:27;"It's interesting that the guy who was the main programmer dude at FMU"
14:27;14:28;"managed GBV."
14:28;14:29;"He did?"
14:29;14:30;"Yeah."
14:30;14:31;"Oh, David Newgarden."
14:31;14:32;"David Newgarden."
14:32;14:33;"Oh, I didn't know that."
14:33;14:34;"Yeah."
14:34;14:35;"Wow."
14:35;14:38;"This is also-- you referenced one of your songs being like this,"
14:38;14:40;"just like reading a newspaper."
14:40;14:47;"[playing]"
14:47;14:48;"Yeah."
14:48;15:06;"[playing]"
15:06;15:07;"Wow."
15:07;15:09;"[playing]"
15:09;15:13;"Did you find-- when I first heard those recordings of ours"
15:13;15:18;"and mine from so long ago, it was this weird double experience"
15:18;15:22;"of knowing all of those things way back in my brain,"
15:22;15:26;"but then also hearing it for the first time out at Utterly."
15:26;15:27;"It's a weird experience."
15:27;15:30;"Yeah, I remember-- I mean, yeah, we must have just like--"
15:30;15:31;"It's just like often you're--"
15:31;15:32;"Listen to it over and over."
15:32;15:33;"Yeah."
15:33;15:34;"Deep in your subconscious."
15:34;15:35;"I remember so many of these--"
15:35;15:36;"Yeah."
15:36;15:37;"So many of the details."
15:37;15:39;"I remember Wes is sneezing at the beginning of that one"
15:39;15:41;"we just listened to, the Christmas song."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:42;16:01;"[playing]"
16:01;16:04;"I guess this is still Radiohead vibes."
16:04;16:08;"[playing]"
16:08;16:10;"So who's playing drums here?"
16:10;16:12;"Hmm."
16:12;16:13;"There were a lot of drummers."
16:13;16:14;"Andre played drums."
16:14;16:16;"Wes could hold it down on drums."
16:16;16:20;"Steve was the go-to drummer, Steve Kondoris."
16:20;16:26;"[playing]"
16:26;16:27;"See, it's funny."
16:27;16:30;"I can hear-- there's just a moment where I stop doing this weird,"
16:30;16:33;"awkward, Johnny Rotten thing."
16:33;16:36;"And I start as he went, ""Bella promise."""
16:36;16:37;"More like Velvet Underground."
16:37;16:39;"Or probably for me too, Belle and Sebastian."
16:39;16:41;"Just kind of gentle delivery."
16:41;16:42;"Soft."
16:42;16:48;"[playing]"
16:48;16:51;"I think I'm just feeling that tristate energy."
16:51;16:52;"I'm just getting Lou."
16:52;16:53;"Yeah."
16:53;16:55;"More than Stuart."
16:55;16:57;"I mean, they got something in common."
16:57;16:58;"Should we get Wes on?"
16:58;16:59;"Yeah, let's get Wes on."
16:59;17:01;"To contribute to this conversation?"
17:01;17:02;"Yeah."
17:02;17:03;"Let's get Wes on the horn."
17:03;17:04;"Let's do it."
17:04;17:07;"That is a weird through line between Belle and Sebastian and Lou Reed."
17:07;17:09;"Yeah, like the softer side of Velvet Underground."
17:09;17:10;"For sure."
17:10;17:14;"Stephanie says, Stephanie says."
17:14;17:16;"Yeah, I had never thought of it before."
17:16;17:19;"And then Teresa put on like the--"
17:19;17:21;"what's the classic Belle and Sebastian record?"
17:21;17:22;"There's a bunch."
17:23;17:24;"Maybe Boy With The Arab Strap?"
17:24;17:26;"Boy With The Arab Strap and If You're Feeling Sinister"
17:26;17:28;"are often considered the best."
17:28;17:30;"Were you a Belle and Sebastian fan?"
17:30;17:32;"I didn't encounter them until much later."
17:32;17:33;"It's so funny."
17:33;17:36;"I mean, it's in the name of the Sophistic-Ups,"
17:36;17:42;"but your musical worldview seems so kind of like erudite from so early."
17:42;17:45;"We were slightly closer to Manhattan."
17:45;17:49;"How long would it take to get from your guy's town to Manhattan?"
17:49;17:51;"Hour 45, two hours."
17:51;17:52;"Ooh."
17:52;17:53;"It was deep."
17:53;17:54;"Down the 684."
17:54;17:56;"What about on the train?"
17:56;17:59;"Similar, you have to drive to New Haven to park in the commuter route."
17:59;18:00;"Okay, you're right."
18:00;18:03;"45-minute drive to New Haven and then an hour on the train."
18:03;18:04;"And then maybe there's also like--"
18:04;18:05;"Good Lord."
18:05;18:09;"Your parents are from there, moved out to Jersey,"
18:09;18:12;"whereas we would go in maybe like once a year at Christmas"
18:12;18:14;"to go to the Museum of Natural History or something."
18:14;18:16;"My dad would just be like, ""There's traffic!"""
18:16;18:17;"Right."
18:17;18:20;"Yeah, going to New York stressed our parents out,"
18:20;18:21;"so we didn't go a lot."
18:21;18:22;"Yeah."
18:22;18:24;"It stressed my parents in certain ways, but yeah, sure."
18:24;18:26;"My grandparents still lived in the Bronx."
18:26;18:28;"I'd go spend the weekend with them."
18:28;18:32;"And also just straight up, the train from Glen Ridge to Penn Station"
18:32;18:33;"is exactly 30 minutes."
18:33;18:34;"I did it one time."
18:34;18:35;"Oh, yeah."
18:35;18:37;"I was like--"
18:37;18:38;"Were you picking something up?"
18:38;18:41;"Giving some keys back to your mom or something."
18:41;18:42;"That sounds right."
18:42;18:45;"Yeah, it's a very pleasant, weird--"
18:45;18:47;"It kind of reminded me of like Europe or something."
18:47;18:49;"You know what? It's funny."
18:49;18:52;"It reminds me of some Soviet film, like Stalker,"
18:52;18:56;"because you leave Manhattan and you're suddenly just going through--"
18:56;18:57;"Hello?"
18:57;18:58;"Hey, what's up, Wes?"
18:58;18:59;"Yeah, what's up?"
18:59;19:01;"What's up? Welcome to Time Crisis."
19:01;19:02;"You're on with everybody."
19:02;19:04;"We got Jake and Dave in the room."
19:04;19:05;"Hey, Wes."
19:05;19:06;"What's up?"
19:06;19:07;"Plus Nick and Seinfeld."
19:07;19:12;"We were just talking about the train from Penn Station to Glen Ridge."
19:12;19:16;"I was saying it kind of reminds me of like the Soviet film, Stalker, or something,"
19:16;19:19;"because Glen Ridge is 12 miles from Manhattan, right?"
19:19;19:20;"Does that sound right?"
19:20;19:21;"Yeah."
19:21;19:24;"Yeah, I think so. 12, 13."
19:24;19:26;"Because I remember a couple of times you and I would like drove to Glen Ridge"
19:26;19:30;"at like 11 p.m. and we'd get there in 21 minutes."
19:30;19:33;"But it's such an insane drive because you're driving through--"
19:33;19:34;"20.2 miles."
19:34;19:37;"It's 20.2 miles? Well, not as the crow flies."
19:37;19:38;"Not as the crow flies."
19:38;19:39;"True."
19:39;19:43;"This drive is so weird because you're going through like this weird industrial wasteland"
19:43;19:49;"and then the meadowlands, which is a weird mix of like pollution and wildlife."
19:49;19:53;"This is an ignorant question, but is it like the beginning of The Sopranos?"
19:53;19:55;"It's exactly the beginning of The Sopranos."
19:55;19:58;"The beginning of The Sopranos is coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel"
19:58;20:03;"and driving to North Caldwell, which is actually just a little bit further than Glen Ridge."
20:03;20:11;"Yeah, there's a lot of empty space, like just actual swamp and like some highways over it,"
20:11;20:16;"which is always kind of weird because you're going from like really dense suburbs to the city."
20:16;20:21;"And then there's like airports to your left and right."
20:21;20:27;"There's a part where the train goes like--it's kind of like banged really slow."
20:27;20:30;"So you feel like you're like tipping over."
20:30;20:34;"Yeah, there's this funny part where the train has to like slow down and a lot of times the lights turn off,"
20:34;20:37;"which also seems very like you're in some weird part of Eastern Europe."
20:37;20:40;"I have a vague memory of that."
20:40;20:48;"Yeah, there's parts of that ride where you just like you feel like you're in some post-apocalyptic strange place."
20:48;20:54;"On the last episode, we were listening to some of Jake and Dave's band from the 90s called American People."
20:54;20:55;"Nice."
20:55;21:00;"And then I've been going back through some of the archives already and playing a bunch of Sophistic-Uffs."
21:00;21:01;"Oh, yeah?"
21:01;21:04;"Yeah, we were listening to a little bit of Groove Prophecy."
21:04;21:05;"That was the name of the acid jazz band."
21:05;21:07;"Me and Wes were on sax and Jake."
21:07;21:09;"Wes, you sounded great on that, man."
21:09;21:11;"Oh, thank you."
21:11;21:15;"Yeah, we were pretty good for 14, 15 years old or whatever."
21:15;21:17;"Well, yeah, where to start?"
21:17;21:23;"What are your memories of growing up in New Jersey before getting into music?"
21:23;21:33;"Well, very much in the shadow of the city, commuting lifestyle all around us."
21:33;21:37;"But yeah, it's a nice, it's a good place to grow up, I think."
21:37;21:42;"Nice barrier between you and too much chaos via the swamp."
21:42;21:45;"These guys grew up an hour 45 away from the city."
21:45;21:46;"I didn't realize that."
21:46;21:47;"Okay."
21:47;21:49;"Okay, so that's pretty far."
21:49;21:50;"Ex-urban Connecticut."
21:50;21:56;"We could really view the lens of this juvenilia through the proximity."
21:56;21:59;"Dave was saying he could hear the sophistication of our..."
21:59;22:01;"Definitely."
22:01;22:06;"Yeah, I do think like, I mean, this is maybe separate, definitely separate."
22:06;22:10;"We did play like, you said, you know, it's like acid jazz band."
22:10;22:18;"And then, you know, like all these other different types of bands, like actually in school, like playing classical music."
22:18;22:25;"And then also, you know, playing like experimental stuff in my basement."
22:25;22:35;"And even, you know, I think like our first like, quote unquote, attempt to make a record was all like,"
22:35;22:43;"I feel like I remember we made a list of like styles of music and we wanted to make a song for each one."
22:43;22:47;"Oh, that sounds like inspired by Magnetic Fields."
22:47;22:48;"Probably, yeah."
22:48;22:51;"That was a record floating around a lot with like, our friends was 69?"
22:51;22:53;"69 love songs."
22:53;22:56;"I don't want to get over you."
22:56;23:00;"I guess I could take a sleeping pill."
23:00;23:02;"And sleep at will."
23:02;23:06;"And not have to go through what I go through."
23:06;23:09;"I guess I should take Prozac right."
23:09;23:11;"And just smile all night."
23:11;23:13;"It's somebody new."
23:13;23:16;"Somebody not too bright."
23:16;23:18;"But sweet and kind."
23:18;23:22;"Who would try to get you off my mind."
23:22;23:26;"I can leave this agony behind."
23:26;23:29;"Which is just what I'd do if I wanted to."
23:29;23:33;"But I don't want to get over you."
23:33;23:39;"Yes, we went through it and we probably only did like half of them or maybe less."
23:39;23:44;"And even some of those were recorded over or whatever."
23:44;23:47;"Because we didn't really have the technology to like keep everything back then."
23:47;23:50;"Yeah, because we were just listening to that song Salmonella Poisoning."
23:50;23:52;"That's like a fake sea shanty."
23:52;23:56;"Yeah, that was going to be one I wanted to bring up."
23:56;23:58;"Because it's really fun."
23:58;24:00;"It's like kind of random."
24:00;24:02;"We've already played a few."
24:02;24:04;"What are some that come to mind?"
24:04;24:10;"Well, I think sometimes, yeah, the ones we played live the most."
24:10;24:15;"Probably like Death Will Slowly Come and Polizze."
24:15;24:18;"Oh, Polizze. Is there a recording of that?"
24:18;24:20;"Yeah, there's a demo version."
24:20;24:22;"Do you know which is the best version?"
24:22;24:24;"There's live and live at Serendipity."
24:24;24:27;"Well, yeah, I don't know."
24:27;24:32;"I think the one Fairy's Flight into Polizze is pretty good as a live thing."
24:32;24:35;"That's a really long chunk of..."
24:35;24:38;"I'll click around on it here. I'm going to play it."
24:38;24:39;"You should be able to hear it."
24:39;24:40;"Yeah."
24:40;24:41;"Okay, Fairy's Flight."
24:41;24:44;"We're very interested in genre."
24:44;24:45;"Yeah, yeah."
24:45;24:48;"I think through Ween we were super into that idea."
24:48;24:50;"Just like doing genre experiments."
24:50;24:52;"We were really into chocolate and cheese,"
24:52;24:55;"which was like every song on that record is a different genre."
24:55;24:56;"Right."
24:56;24:58;"So we would definitely do like..."
24:58;25:00;"And Pure Guava, Death Pod."
25:00;25:02;"That's why we did like our 80s song."
25:02;25:05;"Right. We kind of had an 80s song too."
25:05;25:08;"Yeah, so this is like this rocker."
25:08;25:11;"Instrumental too."
25:11;25:12;"Oh, instrumental."
25:12;25:15;"Three or four minutes."
25:15;25:19;"But then there's a demo version of Polizze that's really good too."
25:19;25:20;"Oh, yeah."
25:20;25:23;"Okay, here's the demo of Polizze."
25:23;25:33;"I've always wanted to do something with this riff."
25:33;25:34;"This is a cool riff."
25:35;25:37;"[Humming]"
25:37;25:43;"Oh, yeah."
25:43;25:47;"Same intonation."
25:47;25:48;"Yeah."
25:48;25:50;"High school intonation."
25:50;25:52;"Yeah, definitely not that in tune."
25:52;26:00;"[Singing]"
26:00;26:02;"This is back to my punk voice."
26:02;26:04;"Yeah, your voice is your voice."
26:04;26:10;"I would just say that these guys' voice sounds like..."
26:10;26:14;"I can hear in the recordings at some point I finally figured out how to sing soft."
26:14;26:17;"And that's when some of these recordings don't have this like..."
26:17;26:19;"[Singing]"
26:19;26:23;"It's almost like a police vibe."
26:23;26:25;"Yeah, that's why we called it Polizze."
26:25;26:26;"Oh, really?"
26:26;26:30;"I didn't get that."
26:30;26:32;"Wow."
26:32;26:34;"Yeah, that's weird that I just thought..."
26:34;26:37;"Where are you getting that?"
26:37;26:38;"It's from that..."
26:38;26:40;"[Singing]"
26:40;26:46;"We had very few songs that were just like rock."
26:46;26:49;"I think we always had all these weird keyboards down there too."
26:49;26:51;"Yeah."
26:51;26:52;"Maybe it's something about..."
26:52;26:55;"There's like some shoegaze stuff too."
26:55;26:58;"Like this kind of instrumental shoegazing."
26:58;27:00;"Can you picture Sting?"
27:00;27:07;"[Singing]"
27:07;27:09;"Yeah, I was trying to remember..."
27:09;27:10;"That's a cool one."
27:10;27:13;"What do you remember listening to, Wes, in high school?"
27:13;27:14;"Early high school."
27:14;27:16;"Early to mid high school."
27:16;27:17;"I guess probably like..."
27:17;27:19;"Pavement, maybe?"
27:19;27:20;"Yeah, same."
27:20;27:22;"Pavement was definitely in the mix."
27:22;27:24;"Because I feel like the older guys were like huge pavement heads."
27:24;27:25;"So we kind of..."
27:25;27:26;"Yeah."
27:26;27:27;"Absorbed that."
27:27;27:29;"I feel like Ezra was not a fan."
27:29;27:30;"At least..."
27:30;27:31;"I feel like when I first met you, Ezra,"
27:31;27:32;"you were even like..."
27:32;27:33;"Kind of were like..."
27:33;27:34;"A little bit anti."
27:34;27:37;"Just sort of like, ""That's a different generation."
27:37;27:38;"I'm on my own thing."""
27:38;27:40;"I think just like the critics,"
27:40;27:41;"I had a journey."
27:41;27:43;"Late 90s, older guys listening to Pavement."
27:43;27:44;"I'd be like, ""This is cool."""
27:44;27:45;"And we sometimes played..."
27:45;27:47;"What was the song we played, Wes?"
27:47;27:48;"Shady Lane."
27:48;27:49;"Yes."
27:49;27:50;"So I don't know how I knew that."
27:50;27:51;"I just knew it."
27:51;27:54;"[Singing]"
27:55;27:57;"[Singing]"
27:57;27:59;"Yeah, talk about a song like..."
27:59;28:00;"A lighter shade of pale."
28:00;28:02;"I have no idea what the lyrics mean."
28:02;28:04;"I mean, and you know, there's still avant-garde."
28:04;28:06;"So I think I liked it then."
28:06;28:07;"And I even remember,"
28:07;28:08;"because I had an internship..."
28:08;28:10;"We covered a Weezer song."
28:10;28:11;"Which Weezer song?"
28:11;28:13;"Wait, Weezer was big."
28:13;28:14;"I can't remember now."
28:14;28:15;"Something off the first record?"
28:15;28:16;"I don't know."
28:16;28:17;"People were always playing..."
28:17;28:18;"[Singing]"
28:18;28:19;"Say it ain't so."
28:19;28:20;"Oh, oh, oh."
28:20;28:21;"El Scorcho."
28:21;28:23;"El Scorcho, yeah."
28:23;28:24;"El Scorcho."
28:24;28:26;"I just think by the 2000s..."
28:26;28:27;"You know, it's like you like something"
28:27;28:29;"when you're 15 or 16,"
28:29;28:31;"and then you're in college,"
28:31;28:33;"and I was kind of just not interested"
28:33;28:34;"in pavement anymore,"
28:34;28:36;"and suddenly being like..."
28:36;28:38;"Going way deeper on..."
28:38;28:39;"Fairport Convention."
28:39;28:41;"I don't know, just starting to feel like..."
28:41;28:42;"I don't know what this means to me."
28:42;28:44;"It's not my generation."
28:44;28:46;"It makes sense that you would"
28:46;28:48;"not vibe with pavement."
28:48;28:49;"You're not Gen X."
28:49;28:51;"We also were..."
28:51;28:54;"I feel like we were very excited"
28:54;28:58;"when The Strokes began."
28:58;29:00;"I feel like we covered half of that record,"
29:00;29:03;"maybe, at least three songs."
29:03;29:05;"In terms of new music."
29:05;29:07;"Instantly fans of The Strokes."
29:07;29:09;"I remember feeling like..."
29:09;29:12;"Somebody gave me a burnt CD of The Strokes"
29:12;29:14;"for the fall of my freshman year of college,"
29:14;29:16;"and it was almost like..."
29:16;29:18;"This is going to change your life."
29:18;29:20;"Kind of a vibe."
29:20;29:22;"And I don't know."
29:22;29:24;"I just had a chip on my shoulder about The Strokes."
29:24;29:26;"I was like, ""Oh, this is just going to rehash."
29:26;29:29;"This is going to be nostalgic for some prior era."""
29:29;29:31;"Yeah, I remember thinking they were posers."
29:31;29:32;"Yeah."
29:32;29:34;"I've grown to love their hits."
29:34;29:36;"They're undeniable."
29:36;29:37;"Of all the bands."
29:37;29:38;"Actually, I watched that"
29:38;29:40;"Meet Me in the Bathroom doc a few months ago,"
29:40;29:41;"and it's like..."
29:41;29:43;"In my opinion, they're the only good band"
29:43;29:45;"out of that era."
29:45;29:47;"But at the time, I was just like,"
29:47;29:48;"""Yeah, these guys are posers."
29:48;29:50;"They like Lou Reed. Big deal."""
29:50;29:52;"I think I said this on this show."
29:52;29:53;"Jake's Take."
29:53;29:55;"And that's a nice, cold Jake's Take."
29:55;29:58;"Like I said, I've grown to love a lot of their songs."
29:58;30:01;"I don't throw in a record of theirs."
30:01;30:03;"That's a 2001. You're 24 years old."
30:03;30:04;"Oh, yeah."
30:04;30:05;"I'm over it, dude."
30:05;30:06;"Yeah."
30:06;30:08;"You're probably getting into 1950s country by then."
30:08;30:10;"Yeah, I was on my kneel."
30:10;30:12;"Probably the first Rod Stewart solo record."
30:12;30:14;"Yeah, Neil Young, Faces."
30:14;30:15;"Yeah."
30:15;30:17;"Because we were in high school."
30:17;30:18;"Yeah, we were 18."
30:18;30:19;"Copy that, man. I get it."
30:19;30:21;"And we already liked, you know,"
30:21;30:22;"Via Andre and stuff."
30:22;30:26;"We already did like Modern Lovers and Television."
30:26;30:27;"No, it was perfect."
30:27;30:30;"I mean, you guys were lined up."
30:30;30:32;"We're funk rockers for that."
30:32;30:33;"Yeah."
30:33;30:36;"Last night, she said,"
30:36;30:39;"""Oh, baby, I feel so down."""
30:39;30:44;"Oh, it turned me on when I feel left out."
30:44;30:48;"So I, I turn around."
30:48;30:51;"Oh, baby, I don't care no more."
30:51;30:53;"I know this for sure."
30:53;30:56;"I'm walking out that door."
30:56;31:00;"But I've been in town for just about 50 minutes now."
31:00;31:03;"Oh, baby, I feel so down."
31:03;31:07;"And I don't know why I keep walking for miles."
31:07;31:12;"See, people, they don't understand."
31:12;31:16;"Your girlfriends, they can't understand."
31:16;31:21;"Your grandsons, they won't understand."
31:21;31:26;"On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand."
31:26;31:30;"Last night, she said,"
31:30;31:33;"""Oh, baby, I feel so down."""
31:33;31:37;"Oh, it turned me on when I feel left out."
31:37;31:41;"So I, I turn around."
31:41;31:44;"Oh, baby, gonna be alright."
31:44;31:46;"It was a great big lie."
31:46;31:48;"'Cause I left that night."
31:48;31:49;"Yeah."
31:49;31:52;"To Dave's point, I, and I might have said this before,"
31:52;31:55;"but I, there's like two times I remember hearing something"
31:55;31:57;"and the experience of hearing it,"
31:57;31:58;"or like how it was introduced to me,"
31:58;32:01;"like has stayed with me to this day."
32:01;32:07;"And I remember being in a dorm at Barnard,"
32:07;32:09;"you know, across from Columbia,"
32:09;32:12;"and a girl running into the dorm,"
32:12;32:15;"into the room going, to your point, saying,"
32:15;32:17;"""This is gonna change your life,"""
32:17;32:19;"and putting it on at a party."
32:19;32:21;"So what was your feeling about it?"
32:21;32:22;"I mean, it was like, well, yeah,"
32:22;32:24;"it was that it was the best thing I'd ever heard."
32:24;32:25;"Wow. Okay."
32:25;32:28;"But also the context of it, of being in New York,"
32:28;32:31;"being at Barnard in a dorm at a party,"
32:31;32:35;"and someone basically stopping whatever everyone's doing,"
32:35;32:36;"was like, ""It's here."""
32:36;32:38;"And having the kind of, I don't know,"
32:38;32:40;"to be really saying, in my mind,"
32:40;32:42;"she said, ""This is gonna change your life."""
32:42;32:44;"Just like, you know, the feeling of when everyone's"
32:44;32:47;"sort of making you feel like it was gonna change your life,"
32:47;32:49;"but I'm pretty sure she articulated it,"
32:49;32:51;"and she said, ""This is gonna be it."""
32:51;32:54;"And I said that, and when I was at a party"
32:54;32:57;"in Fort Lauderdale, I was living in Fort Lauderdale,"
32:57;32:58;"and I remember being in a party."
32:58;33:00;"And I heard, ""Whoomp, there it is,"" for the first time."
33:00;33:01;"For the first time, changed my life."
33:01;33:03;"No, I, you know, I had said it,"
33:03;33:04;"it was that no one was dancing,"
33:04;33:06;"and no one had ever heard ""Hey-ya,"""
33:06;33:08;"and this girl put on ""Hey-ya."""
33:08;33:09;"And the whole party changed."
33:09;33:11;"And like, no one had heard it, and it was like,"
33:11;33:14;"""Oh, this is a very different situation now."""
33:14;33:15;"And I remember being like,"
33:15;33:17;"""Oh, this is gonna be the biggest song"
33:17;33:18;"I've ever done in my lifetime,"" or something."
33:18;33:20;"- I have a Strokes-related memory, too,"
33:20;33:21;"which is, I feel like, Wes,"
33:21;33:24;"I bet this was visiting you at Syracuse."
33:24;33:28;"I have a memory of being in some kind of house party,"
33:28;33:30;"you know, just some like, hardcore college party,"
33:30;33:32;"people at (beep) face dancing,"
33:32;33:35;"and everybody, whatever they'd be playing at the time,"
33:35;33:37;"like Nelly or something."
33:37;33:39;"And I remember some girl,"
33:39;33:40;"♪ So hot and ♪"
33:40;33:42;"Yeah, and everybody's dancing, having a good time."
33:42;33:45;"And a girl came in,"
33:45;33:46;"and she wanted to change the music,"
33:46;33:48;"and she put on the first single"
33:48;33:50;"from the third Strokes album,"
33:50;33:52;"which is dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun."
33:52;33:53;"- Oh, that song rules."
33:53;33:54;"- It's a good song."
33:54;33:55;"- Yeah."
33:55;33:56;"♪ Ba-na-na-na-na-na ♪"
33:56;33:58;"♪ Some people think they're always right ♪"
33:58;33:59;"Yeah, yeah."
33:59;34:00;"- Oh, yeah."
34:00;34:01;"- That's one of the better Strokes songs."
34:01;34:02;"- It's a very good song."
34:02;34:03;"- That's a top five Strokes song."
34:03;34:04;"- But I remember, it lasted about a minute."
34:04;34:05;"And at the time, I remember thinking,"
34:05;34:07;"""Well, the Strokes are a big band."""
34:07;34:09;"They're on the third album, whatever that was, 2005."
34:09;34:11;"But I'd also just remember looking around the party"
34:11;34:14;"and just being like, ""Oh, people are, like, pissed."
34:14;34:15;"""This is not working."""
34:15;34:16;"(laughing)"
34:16;34:17;"Even though I liked the song."
34:17;34:19;"And I just kind of remember thinking, like,"
34:19;34:21;"""Oh, is 'Rock Played Out'?"""
34:21;34:23;"It was like the first time I saw it in real time."
34:23;34:27;"Just, like, a bunch of, like, mostly white college kids"
34:27;34:29;"just hearing, like, the Strokes,"
34:29;34:30;"who people would say that's a band"
34:30;34:31;"made for white college kids,"
34:31;34:33;"and just being like, ""What are you doing?"""
34:33;34:34;"- Yeah."
34:34;34:35;"- ""We can't party to this."""
34:35;34:36;"- That's funny."
34:36;34:38;"- Wow, that's an early ""Rock's Played Out"" dog memory."
34:38;34:39;"- Yeah."
34:39;34:40;"- Very ""Rock's Played Out."""
34:40;34:42;"- I do kind of, kind of going along with that,"
34:42;34:45;"I do feel like when that record first,"
34:45;34:46;"the first record came out,"
34:46;34:49;"we were kind of in that phase of senior year"
34:49;34:50;"where we can, like, you know,"
34:50;34:53;"we started to be able to leave school for lunch"
34:53;34:57;"and, like, just kind of go wherever."
34:57;34:59;"And oftentimes, we'd end up back at my house"
34:59;35:01;"and, like, put on MTV, too,"
35:01;35:02;"and, like, watch music videos."
35:02;35:05;"Like, ""Bad,"" or, you know, like,"
35:05;35:07;"""At the Drive-In"" or something."
35:07;35:09;"- Oh, yeah, or ""The Hives."""
35:09;35:11;"- Yeah, yeah, ""The Hives,"" yeah."
35:11;35:15;"But I remember Ezra, the day after, like,"
35:15;35:16;"one day we went back"
35:16;35:19;"and we were, like, anxiously awaiting the video."
35:19;35:20;"I was like, ""Oh, that's cool."""
35:20;35:21;"And the next day, I was, like,"
35:21;35:23;"I was all psyched to watch it again."
35:23;35:25;"I was like, ""Dude, 'Someday' is on."
35:25;35:26;"""'Someday' music video is on."""
35:26;35:28;"And he's shouting to you downstairs,"
35:28;35:30;"and you're like, ""Okay."""
35:30;35:33;"- Oh, I turned the corner?"
35:33;35:35;"- Yeah, just, like, the next day,"
35:35;35:37;"you were like, ""Okay, yeah, whatever."
35:37;35:38;"""I saw it yesterday."""
35:38;35:39;"- Rocks played out, dog."
35:39;35:40;"- No biggie."
35:40;35:41;"Yeah."
35:41;35:42;"- Ezra's moving on."
35:42;35:43;"- Yeah."
35:43;35:45;"Yeah, you were the one that started it."
35:45;35:46;"The rocks played out."
35:46;35:47;"- It was interesting."
35:47;35:50;"I was very not into rock in most of college"
35:50;35:52;"'cause I kind of felt like, you know, who knows?"
35:52;35:53;"Maybe there was something about"
35:53;35:56;"the Strokes were so exciting when they came out,"
35:56;35:58;"but maybe, I don't know,"
35:58;36:00;"maybe the funny age, there was something about it"
36:00;36:02;"that felt like the end of something."
36:02;36:03;"- For sure."
36:03;36:04;"- Yeah."
36:04;36:05;"- Not the beginning."
36:05;36:06;"- Definitely."
36:06;36:07;"- I bet if we were younger,"
36:07;36:08;"if we were 14 or something or 13,"
36:08;36:09;"it would have been like--"
36:09;36:11;"And then I feel like I was really not that into rock music"
36:11;36:14;"until four years later, starting Vampire Weekend,"
36:14;36:15;"picking up a guitar again"
36:15;36:18;"and feeling like there's something novel about it."
36:18;36:19;"And being like, ""Oh, it's kind of fun"
36:19;36:21;"""to try to write some riffs or do something different."""
36:21;36:22;"Maybe in between the day"
36:22;36:24;"that I didn't want to watch the 'Someday' video"
36:24;36:27;"and starting Vampire Weekend."
36:27;36:30;"Yeah, I feel like that's when I was really into"
36:30;36:32;"learning about folk and country"
36:32;36:37;"and dance hall reggae and rap and Southern rap,"
36:37;36:39;"just anything but rock."

38:11;38:13;"Kid A and the Basement."
38:13;38:14;"Yeah, definitely."
38:14;38:18;"Kid A was a very big, very big record for us."
38:18;38:20;"That's cool. Like more than OK Computer."
38:20;38:21;"Yeah, definitely."
38:21;38:23;"I don't remember OK Computer coming out,"
38:23;38:25;"but I remember when Kid A came out."
38:25;38:28;"See, this is the days between, because I was an OK Computer guy."
38:28;38:29;"Yeah."
38:29;38:33;"Played that record every day for a couple of years."
38:33;38:37;"And then I was very, very excited when Kid A came out."
38:37;38:41;"I really anticipated it, and I really, really, really wanted to like it."
38:41;38:45;"And I convinced myself for months that I really liked it."
38:45;38:47;"But in retrospect, I don't."
38:47;38:51;"To me, it's like OK Computer is like the towering apex of that band."
38:51;38:52;"Looking back, it's a terrible record,"
38:52;38:55;"and it was the beginning of the end for Radiohead."
38:55;38:59;"I don't think it's terrible, but I just thought they got so,"
38:59;39:01;"they went too far up their own beehive."
39:01;39:02;"Oh, come on."
39:02;39:03;"This is my take."
39:03;39:05;"Yeah, Jake's Ice Cold Stakes."
39:05;39:06;"I liked it. The first song was great."
39:06;39:07;"Jake's The Loudest Cake."
39:07;39:09;"Everything in its right place is great."
39:09;39:11;"The second song was this sort of like, ""Brr, brr, brr"" song."
39:11;39:12;"Because, wait."
39:12;39:14;"Then there was like the, ""Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh."""
39:14;39:15;"Yeah, the middle school riff."
39:15;39:17;"No, no, no, that one's from, oh, OK."
39:17;39:18;"Kid A, dude."
39:18;39:19;"I thought it was from Amnesia."
39:19;39:22;"Then there's a couple songs that sound like they could have been"
39:22;39:24;"off of OK Computer with the songwriting,"
39:24;39:26;"but just had the worst production on Kid A."
39:26;39:28;"Worst production."
39:28;39:29;"Yeah, I just, I don't know."
39:29;39:30;"Come on."
39:30;39:32;"I love In Rainbows, but--"
39:32;39:33;"Give Jake's his take."
39:33;39:35;"I'm just saying, it's the days between."
39:35;39:36;"I was 24--"
39:36;39:38;"I feel like this is maybe a story that you're telling yourself now."
39:38;39:40;"You had those months where you loved it."
39:40;39:42;"I totally did."
39:42;39:44;"What I'm saying is it didn't stick the landing for me."
39:44;39:45;"OK."
39:45;39:48;"It was that thing of like really anticipating a band's new release"
39:48;39:49;"and convincing yourself."
39:49;39:51;"Kid A was, it was huge."
39:51;39:53;"The moment, the hype."
39:53;39:54;"I remember."
39:54;39:55;"So much."
39:55;39:57;"Because it was the summer of 2000, right?"
39:57;39:58;"I think so."
39:58;39:59;"I was living in Boston."
39:59;40:01;"The album came out in October 2000."
40:01;40:03;"OK, yeah."
40:03;40:06;"So, Jake, it was a month before we went to Europe."
40:06;40:07;"Right."
40:07;40:14;"And I went to the Tower Records right up the street from Berklee College of Music."
40:14;40:16;"I was like living in Boston at the time."
40:16;40:17;"And bought Kid A."
40:17;40:19;"And they were going to be open at midnight that night just to sell that record."
40:19;40:20;"Hell yeah."
40:20;40:22;"On the day that it was released."
40:22;40:23;"It's just, the point is--"
40:23;40:24;"No, no, I totally get it."
40:24;40:28;"--the generations, younger guys, guys younger than me, Kid A is the one."
40:28;40:31;"And guys who are my age, it's OK Computer."
40:31;40:35;"No, and of course I could totally buy a case of why OK Computer is better."
40:35;40:38;"It's just that I just literally don't remember it coming out."
40:38;40:39;"Yeah, you would have been 13."
40:39;40:41;"Yeah, we were just like--"
40:41;40:42;"I was 20."
40:42;40:44;"I was like playing Goldeneye."
40:44;40:45;"You know?"
40:45;40:47;"We were just doing kind of kid stuff."
40:47;40:50;"But by the time OK Computer came out, we were like 16."
40:50;40:51;"Oh yeah, perfect."
40:51;40:56;"I was like reading music criticism and thinking deeply about their influences."
40:56;41:02;"I remember one time saying pretty earnestly to probably Andre or something,"
41:02;41:06;"who was also like, he was on Soul Seek, downloading all this Warp Records stuff."
41:06;41:07;"Hell yeah."
41:07;41:08;"Auditor and stuff."
41:08;41:10;"And I was like, this stuff is very cool."
41:10;41:14;"However, I cannot rate it as highly as I rate Radiohead."
41:14;41:20;"Because these guys take stuff like this and they turn it into songs."
41:20;41:24;"And they bring these out there influences to the masses."
41:24;41:26;"And I just think that's tremendous."
41:26;41:28;"Just like I really earnestly felt that."
41:28;41:30;"I remember Dave and I having those conversations."
41:30;41:31;"Totally."
41:31;41:32;"Absolutely."
41:32;41:41;"With all due respect to boards of Canada, I just cannot rate them as highly as OK Computer."
41:41;41:50;"And I feel like we saw a Radiohead show at Liberty State Park or a festival or the Garden or something."
41:50;41:51;"Yeah, I think the Garden."
41:51;41:52;"Yeah, maybe at the Garden."
41:52;41:54;"I just remember-- and they were playing like--"
41:54;41:55;"On the Kid A tour?"
41:55;41:56;"Kid A amnesiac stuff."
41:56;41:57;"I saw that tour."
41:57;42:02;"Yeah, I remember just like being there and they're mixing all the different material."
42:02;42:06;"They played Paranoid Android, but then they're just playing all the weirder songs."
42:06;42:11;"And I just remember thinking, this is amazing that there's this many people watching this."
42:11;42:12;"It's mystifying to me still."
42:12;42:16;"And with all due respect to Apex Twin, he could not pull this off."
42:16;42:17;"Well, of course."
42:17;42:21;"When I was living in Portland, I had friends that were like, Apex Twin is like the real deal."
42:21;42:23;"Radiohead's sellout beat like crap."
42:23;42:24;"Right."
42:24;42:27;"And there's a lot of people like that, which is hilarious."
42:27;42:30;"[MUSIC - APEX TWIN, ""EVERYTHING""]"
42:31;42:32;"Everything."
42:32;42:37;"Everything."
42:42;42:47;"And it's right there."
42:52;42:56;"And it's right there."
42:56;42:57;"And it's right there."
42:57;43:01;"And it's right there."
43:01;43:11;"Yesterday I woke up sucking on lemon."
43:11;43:16;"Yesterday I woke up sucking on lemon."
43:26;43:31;"Everything."
43:41;43:45;"And it's right there."
43:49;43:51;"And it's right there."
43:51;43:55;"And it's right there."
43:55;44:00;"Right there."
44:00;44:09;"What other records do you remember from high school West that were in the mix?"
44:09;44:15;"Yeah, I was going to say, Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone, the Walkway's first record."
44:15;44:19;"We were probably the first and youngest Walkman fans on earth."
44:19;44:21;"I think it's again because of Andre."
44:21;44:22;"Yeah."
44:22;44:29;"Because me and Wes might have been like-- because we had-- we saw the Walkman open for people before the first album came out."
44:29;44:30;"Like, I still have--"
44:30;44:32;"Like, pianos or something?"
44:32;44:34;"I feel like we saw them open--"
44:34;44:35;"Bowery Ballroom."
44:35;44:37;"We saw them open for a band called Firewater at Bowery Ballroom."
44:37;44:38;"Oh, yeah."
44:38;44:43;"I remember because we had their original vinyl EPs before."
44:43;44:45;"So we were like 16."
44:45;44:46;"Andre was older."
44:46;44:47;"Tennis records."
44:47;44:48;"Yeah, yeah, right."
44:48;44:53;"And they did like a split single with this band Kala, which I always liked."
44:53;44:54;"Oh, yeah."
44:54;44:58;"So yeah, because Andre was like our older friend, he was like working in the city but still lived in Glen Ridge,"
44:58;45:02;"he'd come back and be like, ""There's a really good band called The Walkman."""
45:02;45:09;"And I think it's like probably safe to say that like we were like the only 16-year-olds being like, ""Hell yeah, we f***ed The Walkman."""
45:10;45:14;"And that's why as soon as I got to Columbia, I like emailed them saying, ""Can I have an internship at your studio?"""
45:14;45:18;"I see that it's only 10 blocks from Columbia."
45:18;45:20;"And I think Paul went to Columbia."
45:20;45:22;"So I'm like, ""All right, man. Come by."""
45:22;45:23;"And I like came."
45:23;45:25;"They weren't really recording anything, but they were like--"
45:25;45:30;"I think I like held something when they filmed the rat video."
45:30;45:32;"I was just like, ""Are we getting lunch orders?"""
45:32;45:34;"I can't remember."
45:34;45:35;"I don't know."
45:35;45:39;"I just feel like I just like sat there and soaked up the atmosphere."
45:39;45:42;"Saw the rat the first time I ever played it too."
45:42;45:43;"Yeah, we were--"
45:43;45:47;"They announced it. They were like, ""Oh, this is a new one. Try it out."""
45:47;45:49;"And we were hyped on them because we knew--"
45:49;45:53;"We like stayed and like looked at the set list and it was called Girls at Night."
45:53;45:54;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
45:54;45:55;"It's funny. Yeah."
45:55;45:57;"Sometimes it's like a problem when you get into stuff too early."
45:57;46:03;"I still hear like people talking about The Rat and I'm just like, ""Girls at Night Live is better than the studio recording."""
46:03;46:05;"Wow."
46:07;46:09;"It's getting a little bit too early."
46:09;46:14;"And I feel like, Wes, for you, because they were saying that they heard the police influence and police side,"
46:14;46:20;"but I always feel like the police were such a big band in your household."
46:20;46:22;"Yeah, definitely."
46:22;46:26;"I feel like you probably learned how to sing with such a huge range from listening to Sting."
46:26;46:28;"Is that fair to say?"
46:28;46:30;"Yeah, probably."
46:30;46:31;"I definitely-- Yeah."
46:31;46:33;"I always loved the police."
46:33;46:42;"I feel like I probably-- Yeah, I listen to weirder stuff now, you know?"
46:42;46:44;"I'm done with the police."
46:44;46:46;"Yeah, maybe not done, but like--"
46:46;46:49;"You weren't going to show up freshman year of college and just be like--"
46:49;46:51;"And be like--"
46:51;46:57;"Oh, what kind of stuff are you into? You're like, ""I'm into three things. Andy Summers, Stuart Copeland, and Sting."""
46:57;47:01;"That's the beginning and end for me."
47:01;47:03;"Yeah."
47:03;47:10;"Well, they did have a couple really cool punk songs really early on, too."
47:10;47:15;"Like, the punkier vibe of the Sophistic-Ups, you know?"
47:15;47:17;"Oh, yeah, totally."
47:17;47:18;"The police are so good."
47:18;47:19;"Dead End Job. Yeah."
47:19;47:20;"So good."
47:20;47:21;"The album tracks are sick."
47:21;47:22;"The playing is really cool."
47:22;47:23;"Amazing band."
47:23;47:24;"Yeah."
47:24;47:29;"I never-- I didn't get that from your singing, Wes, but I can totally see it."
47:29;47:31;"That's amazing."
47:31;47:33;"Yeah. Thank you."
47:33;47:35;"I remember--"
47:35;47:43;"Like, sometime when we were both on tour in Europe, the foods and stuff that you were avoiding to be able to sing as you sing,"
47:43;47:46;"I remember just being like, ""Oh, my God, that is so disciplined."""
47:46;47:48;"Yeah. Well, I had to--"
47:48;47:50;"So disciplined and amazing."
47:50;47:52;"Yeah, I learned that from Sting."
47:52;47:53;"Exactly."
47:54;47:58;"Yeah, I just had a bad scare, like losing my voice in 2012."
47:58;48:02;"And so that scared me straight about, you know, like vocal care."
48:02;48:12;"So, yeah, I just-- I had like-- just, you know, the worst feeling ever for me is like wanting to be able to sing something and you can't."
48:12;48:22;"So it's like-- it's worse than the worst pain of like, you know, even tour, FOMO, and like, you know, having a drink after the show."
48:22;48:28;"So, yeah, I learned to be pretty-- have a pretty aesthetic lifestyle."
48:28;48:30;"No drinking, no spicy foods."
48:30;48:33;"Yeah, like no tomatoes, no coffee."
48:33;48:35;"Yeah, no caffeine at all."
48:35;48:39;"I'm like-- I'm very, very caffeine sensitive anyways."
48:39;48:47;"So, actually, the pandemic is like the first time I ever started drinking caffeine consistently for like a long time."
48:47;48:51;"So tell us a bit about the various bands that you were in post high school."
48:51;48:56;"So we graduate high school, SophisticUF's essentially over."
48:56;48:57;"Yeah."
48:57;49:02;"Stay in touch, part ways, I'm down in the city, you're up upstate at Syracuse."
49:02;49:06;"What was the first band happening at Syracuse that you were in?"
49:06;49:09;"Yeah, so I had an alias named Johnny Six Pack."
49:09;49:13;"Played like one or two shows like that."
49:13;49:18;"Played in a couple other like kind of folky, folky groups."
49:18;49:25;"But then there was another like funk, acid jazz group called Sweaty Etiquette."
49:25;49:29;"Okay, because you know what, I'm looking through Andre's Syracuse folder."
49:29;49:30;"Yeah."
49:30;49:31;"I see some Sweaty Etiquette."
49:31;49:34;"Can I play-- what's good to play, Bonkity Bonk?"
49:34;49:35;"That was--"
49:35;49:36;"Is this an original?"
49:36;49:40;"Yes, it's an original instrumental."
49:40;49:44;"I actually know what I played on that, maybe it was drums or--"
49:44;49:48;"So Sweaty Etiquette, the kind of main force was your friend Adam Gold."
49:48;49:49;"Yes, yeah."
49:49;49:52;"Because you respect funk, but he's like a real funk master."
49:52;49:54;"Yes, he's a funk master."
49:54;50:00;"And actually I got to say, because I love this, Adam, Wes's friend who I met, you know, in those years,"
50:00;50:07;"he's stayed in Syracuse and he opened a successful business called Funkin' Waffles,"
50:07;50:09;"which is a venue/restaurant."
50:09;50:10;"Sick."
50:10;50:16;"And one time-- I stopped there maybe four years ago on tour, like driving through upstate,"
50:16;50:20;"I stopped in Syracuse, I got a good waffle."
50:20;50:25;"It was daytime, so there wasn't a show happening, but anybody in Syracuse, go check out Funkin' Waffles."
50:25;50:28;"People drinking beers with waffles at night or--"
50:28;50:30;"Can you speak on that, Wes?"
50:30;50:33;"What's their liquor license situation?"
50:33;50:37;"I think it was a little like on the DL in the days when I was there."
50:37;50:40;"But it started off as like house parties."
50:40;50:45;"They would show up at a house, like at a frat maybe or something,"
50:45;50:52;"and bring a bunch of waffle batter and play music and make waffles for people."
50:52;50:53;"Oh."
50:53;50:55;"And then decided to make it a restaurant."
50:55;50:56;"A brick and mortar?"
50:56;51:06;"And actually, probably 2006 or 2007 Vampire Weekend Ra-Ra Riot show took place at the original Funkin' Waffles location."
51:06;51:07;"That's right."
51:07;51:13;"Yeah, because actually a lot of our-- the vast majority of early Vampire Weekend shows"
51:13;51:18;"happened either in New York City or Syracuse."
51:18;51:20;"We played up there a bunch."
51:20;51:21;"Yeah."
51:21;51:22;"Right."
51:22;51:24;"So, OK, what's after Sweaty Etiquette?"
51:24;51:26;"When did Ra-Ra Riot start?"
51:26;51:31;"Well, Ra-Ra Riot started very late, kind of like the last semester of college."
51:31;51:33;"I'm trying to think of what else."
51:33;51:38;"Well, as I look through this folder, I see some songs without a lot of information."
51:38;51:40;"Revenge of the Blade?"
51:40;51:41;"Oh, yeah."
51:41;51:49;"There's a noise band I was in called Skeleton Warrior, I think it was called."
51:49;51:50;"What's River?"
51:50;51:51;"Moist Reflections."
51:51;51:54;"Oh, so that's a radio show."
51:54;52:02;"So my friend John and Stone, they had this radio show called Moist Reflections."
52:02;52:09;"And they would just kind of always-- they would be playing music, but then also jamming"
52:09;52:10;"in the studio."
52:10;52:14;"And John was a big weaned head as well."
52:14;52:18;"So he was very into silly songwriting."
52:18;52:20;"But he was very good at it."
52:20;52:25;"And so I came in as Johnny Sixpack and played The River."
52:25;52:27;"And that's what that song is."
52:27;52:28;"So this is you and John?"
52:28;52:29;"Yeah."
52:29;52:30;"Is this The River or The Rock?"
52:30;52:31;"Yeah."
52:31;52:33;"OK, I remember this song."
52:33;52:35;"So this is live on Syracuse Radio?"
52:35;52:36;"Yeah."
52:36;52:37;"All right, yo."
52:37;52:39;"Jazz 88."
52:39;52:40;"Jazz 88?"
52:40;52:41;"That's the--"
52:41;52:43;"[MUSIC - THE RIVER, ""JAZZ 88""]"
52:43;52:44;"That's right."
52:44;52:45;"Not good?"
52:45;52:46;"That's not good."
52:46;52:48;"I don't like that either."
52:48;52:49;"All right."
52:49;52:50;"[MUSIC - THE RIVER, ""JAZZ 88""]"
52:50;52:51;"All right."
52:51;52:52;"Yeah, yeah."
52:52;52:53;"Oh, oh."
52:53;52:54;"That's not good."
52:54;52:55;"The river."
52:55;52:56;"The rock."
52:56;52:58;"The river."
52:58;52:59;"The rock."
52:59;53:01;"What are you-- it's like a drum machine?"
53:01;53:03;"Yeah, it's just like a little Casio."
53:03;53:06;"The river."
53:06;53:07;"Oh."
53:08;53:09;"Ah."
53:13;53:14;"Woo!"
53:14;53:15;"The river."
53:15;53:17;"[MUSIC - THE RIVER, ""JAZZ 88""]"
53:17;53:18;"The rock."
53:18;53:19;"Yeah."
53:19;53:20;"The river."
53:20;53:23;"[MUSIC - THE RIVER, ""JAZZ 88""]"
53:23;53:26;"The river."
53:26;53:28;"The river."
53:28;53:30;"That's funny, because I was just playing that song,"
53:30;53:32;"""Great Expectations,"" and I was talking about how--"
53:32;53:33;"Oh, yeah."
53:33;53:36;"--it's like kind of a necessary phase as a songwriter"
53:36;53:39;"to get like insanely simple."
53:39;53:40;"Yeah."
53:40;53:42;"And then you kind of open back up."
53:42;53:44;"Like just saying, the river, the rock, over and over again,"
53:44;53:45;"or great expectations."
53:45;53:46;"Yeah."
53:46;53:48;"And then a bridge can be very easy."
53:48;53:51;"It's just like another-- any other word."
53:51;53:52;"Wait, so what about this?"
53:52;53:54;"There's something labeled ""Low Tang Can You Tell."""
53:54;53:56;"Is that like the demo of ""Can You Tell?"""
53:56;53:57;"Oh, yeah."
53:57;53:58;"That's probably the first demo of ""Can You Tell?"""
53:58;54:00;"So is this before Rararai was a band,"
54:00;54:02;"and you'd just be like messing around by yourself?"
54:02;54:03;"Yeah, I think this is--"
54:03;54:07;"[MUSIC - THE RARARAI, ""CAN YOU TELL""]"
54:07;54:10;"(SINGING) Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
54:10;54:11;"Oh, man."
54:11;54:12;"I think this is--"
54:12;54:13;"Yeah."
54:13;54:14;"--2004."
54:14;54:15;"This song rules."
54:15;54:17;"[MUSIC - THE RARARAI, ""CAN YOU TELL""]"
54:17;54:19;"Do you feel like this is like the first time you"
54:19;54:22;"wrote a proper song that you did something with?"
54:22;54:24;"Yeah, probably, yeah."
54:24;54:27;"This is like in my Billy Bragg phase, I think."
54:27;54:28;"Oh, yeah."
54:28;54:30;"This is also a little bit Jonathan Richman, too."
54:30;54:31;"This sounds great."
54:31;54:32;"Now that I hear it."
54:32;54:33;"I love this song."
54:33;54:34;"This is a great song."
54:34;54:42;"[MUSIC - THE RARARAI, ""CAN YOU TELL""]"
54:42;54:45;"So when you wrote this song, ""Rararai"" was not even a thing."
54:45;54:46;"No, yeah."
54:46;54:48;"I hadn't even met most of them yet."
54:48;54:52;"So is it fair to say this is the first ""Rarara"" song?"
54:52;54:53;"Yeah, I think so."
54:53;54:57;"I mean, there was another song that someone--"
54:57;55:00;"I think that Milo had written--"
55:00;55:02;"like started writing before we started."
55:02;55:04;"But this one predates that one, too."
55:04;55:05;"Yeah."
55:05;55:06;"[MUSIC - THE RARARAI, ""CAN YOU TELL""]"
55:06;55:08;"(SINGING) Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
55:08;55:11;"I think about you night and day."
55:11;55:14;"I think about you nightly."
55:14;55:17;"Oh, baby, baby, baby."
55:17;55:20;"When I look you in your eyes--"
55:20;55:22;"When do you think you recorded this song?"
55:22;55:24;"GarageBand?"
55:24;55:28;"It was 2004, so I don't think I--"
55:28;55:32;"I don't think I had a Mac at that point."
55:32;55:34;"I don't know."
55:34;55:37;"Maybe it was a tape, to be honest."
55:37;55:39;"(SINGING) Oh, can you tell?"
55:39;55:42;"I can't even explain."
55:42;55:45;"Baby, baby, baby, baby."
55:45;55:48;"I think about you nightly."
55:54;55:56;"You think this is in your dorm room?"
55:56;56:00;"This was-- I think this is in the basement of our--"
56:00;56:03;"like our first off-campus house."
56:03;56:06;"Because in the fall of 2004, when I was a junior."
56:06;56:07;"So yeah."
56:07;56:08;"Great song."
56:08;56:10;"Wait, I feel like I know this."
56:10;56:12;"""222 Fast."""
56:12;56:13;"Yeah."
56:13;56:16;"Do you think this is also like you first existed as a demo you made by yourself?"
56:16;56:17;"Yeah, definitely."
56:17;56:20;"OK, so this was-- that was on Pro Tools."
56:24;56:28;"Oh, this is something-- this is a different one."
56:33;56:36;"(SINGING) I'm an only in the land."
56:36;56:39;"Can't see the world without you."
56:39;56:43;"You make it hard to walk in this mainland."
56:43;56:44;"I need you, baby."
56:44;56:47;"I think this is my diva phase."
56:47;56:48;"Oh, yeah, totally."
56:48;56:49;"Yeah, this is great."
56:52;56:54;"This would go good next to ""You Don't Love Me."""
56:54;56:55;"Or no, ""She Don't Love Me."""
56:55;56:56;"""She Don't Love Me."""
56:56;56:58;"That's an American people song."
56:58;57:00;"(SINGING) Who is going to stop this?"
57:00;57:05;"222 Fast, 222 Fast, 222 Fast, baby, don't you think that you're wrong?"
57:05;57:11;"222 Fast, 222 Fast, 222 Fast, 222 Fast, baby, don't you think that you're wrong?"
57:11;57:17;"So this is-- yeah, this is a Syracuse demo version of--"
57:17;57:20;"that's a-- that's even not even the first version of that song."
57:20;57:24;"But man, went through so many iterations."
57:24;57:25;"It's crazy."
57:25;57:28;"So ""Rawr Rawr"" was the very end of college."
57:28;57:31;"We should try to do a proper band before school's over?"
57:31;57:34;"Yeah, I think it was like--"
57:34;57:39;"I think it was like-- well, I knew Milo and John."
57:39;57:42;"And I didn't know the string players."
57:42;57:47;"I didn't know Rebecca or Ali or Matt, bass player."
57:47;57:50;"But it was just like kind of like, yeah, you know, just like--"
57:50;57:53;"there doesn't have to be much of a--"
57:53;57:58;"in those days, like much of a reason to get together to play."
57:58;58:00;"Because it's like, oh, I know one or two of these people."
58:00;58:02;"Yeah, let's just play."
58:02;58:10;"And then I had like a Korg Poly 61 that I brought over to a jam session."
58:10;58:11;"They were playing a song."
58:11;58:13;"I just kind of soloed over."
58:13;58:16;"I had to go right away."
58:16;58:18;"And they were like, what's the deal with this guy?"
58:18;58:20;"I just showed up, played a song, and left."
58:20;58:24;"But yeah, I mean, I think John was the glue at first,"
58:24;58:26;"although he missed our first show."
58:26;58:27;"Really?"
58:27;58:28;"Yeah."
58:28;58:33;"He was just like one of those people that is just like very magnetic."
58:33;58:38;"So like even a really big group of people, like seven of us,"
58:38;58:40;"everyone just like kind of wanted to be around"
58:40;58:42;"and like didn't want to miss it."
58:42;58:45;"But then he was like-- he was also very--"
58:45;58:49;"not flaky, but he was just like absent-minded and spontaneous."
58:49;58:52;"So he just like didn't show up for the first show."
58:52;58:56;"And we had a drum machine going for most of it."
58:56;58:59;"But then he came back, and we kept playing."
58:59;59:02;"And then we started playing ""Can You Tell."""
59:02;59:04;"We did a demo of that."
59:04;59:06;"Wait, I feel like maybe I have the demo right here,"
59:06;59:09;"because it's in the RRR folder."
59:09;59:11;"But by the way, have you seen the movie RRR?"
59:11;59:14;"No, I really want to, but it's too long."
59:14;59:15;"I'm like--"
59:15;59:16;"Oh, trust me."
59:16;59:18;"Once you start, you won't care how long it is."
59:18;59:19;"[COUGHS]"
59:19;59:23;"So does this sound like the original--"
59:23;59:26;"I think this is the first RRR demo, yeah."
59:26;59:27;"--demo of it."
59:27;59:30;"[MUSIC - RRR, ""CAN YOU TELL""]"
59:30;59:35;"(SINGING) Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
59:35;59:37;"Your early shows were still like this on campus?"
59:37;59:39;"Yeah, all like basement parties."
59:39;59:41;"(SINGING) I'm about to not leave."
59:41;59:45;"Oh, can you tell I'm losing sleep?"
59:45;59:48;"What am I supposed to do?"
59:48;59:51;"It's hard to stay cool."
59:51;59:55;"We opened for a few kind of regional touring bands."
59:55;59:59;"Yeah, and then we went to New York to play pianos and stuff."
59:59;01:00:02;"Oh, was that your first show in the city?"
01:00:02;01:00:05;"Yeah, it was a big, big deal, because they"
01:00:05;01:00:06;"tried to put us upstairs."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"And they were like, OK, you can only use--"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"drummer can only use hot rods."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"Hot rods?"
01:00:11;01:00:16;"Hot rods-- wait, hot rods are like fake sticks?"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Yeah, it's like basically like--"
01:00:18;01:00:21;"yeah, sticks that are horrible to use"
01:00:21;01:00:25;"and don't make as much noise."
01:00:25;01:00:29;"So we were like, no, we kind of need the drummer"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"to be playing normal."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"So then they put us downstairs."
01:00:34;01:00:39;"Telling somebody they can only use hot rods is so funny."
01:00:39;01:00:42;"You mind just using hot rods?"
01:00:42;01:00:45;"And then it's funny, too, because since we're all here"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"together, I'm trying to remember,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"there was an early Dirty Projectors tour"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"that both me and Wes were on."
01:00:52;01:00:55;"So I was just thinking about, were you guys both in Total War?"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"No, I think that's what happened."
01:00:57;01:01:00;"I knew these people at Columbia, and I played sax"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"in their noise band called Total War."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Wait, Wes, you weren't in Total War?"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"No."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Oh, my god."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"I wonder if there's any Total War recordings."
01:01:08;01:01:09;"Total War is like--"
01:01:09;01:01:10;"Insane."
01:01:10;01:01:13;"--absolutely fierce."
01:01:13;01:01:16;"I guessed it on a Lone Run show once."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:17;01:01:18;"It was my rap crew."
01:01:18;01:01:19;"Yeah."
01:01:19;01:01:20;"I don't think there's any Total War recordings,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"but Total War was a noise band."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And somebody in that band knew this guy"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"that had this thing, Dirty Projectors."
01:01:26;01:01:28;"So I heard early Dirty Projectors."
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I'm hearing songs like ""My Off-White Flag"" and stuff."
01:01:30;01:01:31;"I was like, oh, this rules."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"And they're like, well, we can go on tour with them."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"And I'm like, OK."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"So you were solo, acoustic."
01:01:36;01:01:37;"Yeah."
01:01:37;01:01:38;"And then they opened for you."
01:01:38;01:01:39;"And we played some bizarre--"
01:01:39;01:01:42;"did a bizarre Midwest tour of punk houses."
01:01:42;01:01:44;"It was on spring break--"
01:01:44;01:01:45;"Something like that."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"--going out to Chicago."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"And then after that, we stayed in touch."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"And then the next summer, you were putting together"
01:01:50;01:01:54;"a larger band to do some Getty Address material."
01:01:54;01:01:56;"So probably that's how it happened, that you were like,"
01:01:56;01:01:58;"can you play sax?"
01:01:58;01:01:59;"And I said, sure."
01:01:59;01:02:00;"And maybe you asked me, do you know anybody else who"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"plays sax or something?"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"And then I thought of Wes."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"So then we did a whole tour together."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Was that like a month?"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Was that like a long tour?"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"I think it was only like--"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"This was--"
01:02:10;01:02:12;"In my memory, it was like a week and a half."
01:02:12;01:02:14;"OK, maybe I did a different tour for a month."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"Maybe I--"
01:02:15;01:02:16;"That was the difference."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"That's where you met Jake."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"Oh, OK."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Then there was the tour with Jake."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"That was the 2005 Getty Address tour."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"Oh, right."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"OK, so maybe-- so what were Wes and I playing in that era?"
01:02:25;01:02:29;"Well, yeah, god, I think my memory is a little foggy"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"about it, but--"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"Do you remember any of the material, Wes?"
01:02:32;01:02:35;"I think it was pre-Getty Address."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"I think it was like right before Getty Address."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"And did we go out to Chicago?"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Yeah."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"Everybody wore green."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"Sounds vaguely familiar."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"Oh, yeah."
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"And--"
01:02:47;01:02:50;"We definitely made it to Chicago, and we drove back that night."
01:02:50;01:02:52;"At least Ezra and I did."
01:02:52;01:02:56;"That was maybe either 2004 or 2005."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"And it was the spring break."
01:02:58;01:03:02;"I would like-- I started-- because Jake's friend from Portland,"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"a show promoter named Todd Patrick--"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Todd P."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"--moved to New York."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"Oh, yeah, and he promoted lots of shows."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Doing-- throwing parties and shows in New York,"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"and that was really like--"
01:03:14;01:03:18;"you know, Todd booked my early shows in New York."
01:03:18;01:03:22;"That's how I started playing shows, is through him."
01:03:22;01:03:26;"And then, Ezra, I think we met at a Todd P. show."
01:03:26;01:03:27;"It's possible."
01:03:27;01:03:29;"I think-- no, I think we first met on that tour,"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"on the Total War tour."
01:03:30;01:03:34;"OK, I don't know if I remember the tour you're talking about."
01:03:34;01:03:38;"You were doing solo acoustic, and we opened for you,"
01:03:38;01:03:41;"and I feel like you were just driving by yourself in the van."
01:03:41;01:03:44;"So various members would drive with you sometimes."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"I have-- I can't-- I just-- I can't even imagine where we played."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"I feel like we probably were just playing in empty rooms."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"100%."
01:03:51;01:03:56;"I can't remember-- I have a strong memory of being at a beautiful fraternity building"
01:03:56;01:04:01;"in like July, or like summer or spring break, in Madison, Wisconsin."
01:04:01;01:04:04;"So there were no students around, and just us--"
01:04:04;01:04:07;"like maybe we set up and played to like three people or something."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Oh, I remember that show."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Yeah, when was that?"
01:04:11;01:04:14;"Who knows? It's all a blur."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"Total War and Dirty Projectors on tour together."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Yeah, I think-- I think that's the first time we met."
01:04:19;01:04:20;"But yeah, we all did that--"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Probably '04."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Yeah, probably."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"--the Bay Address tour that I was on with Ezra."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"Yeah, I just wonder what a way out me and Wes were there."
01:04:28;01:04:31;"We were rolling in a couple different vans."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"Oh, who knows?"
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Yeah, I thought that was-- well, hmm."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"Couldn't have been 2005 spring, because I was gone then."
01:04:37;01:04:38;"I was in Japan."
01:04:38;01:04:43;"So I think it was before then, because I think that was going to be the second--"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"there was going to be another tour, and I couldn't make it."
01:04:46;01:04:50;"And I was like, no, I want to-- I'll take my finals early and come back."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"I want to go on tour."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Maybe that was that month-long tour."
01:04:54;01:04:59;"So that was probably 2005, like, yeah, late spring."
01:04:59;01:05:02;"And so that means the one that we were on was 2004."
01:05:02;01:05:06;"But I think you're right about-- in Madison, it felt like summer,"
01:05:06;01:05:07;"and no one was around."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"Yeah, and maybe it was summer."
01:05:09;01:05:12;"I remember playing Allentown."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"Allentown? Was it in a house?"
01:05:14;01:05:19;"No, I feel like it was-- it was in, like, a church."
01:05:19;01:05:22;"I have no memory of ever setting foot in Allentown."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"I vaguely remember that."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"I vaguely remember Allentown."
01:05:25;01:05:29;"Or I think I remember the coffee shop, the experience of waiting for the coffee"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"in Allentown."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"I just remember it, because, like, yeah, it's Allentown."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"I've never played Allentown since."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"The iconic Allentown."
01:05:37;01:05:41;"I think that these tours were being booked through MySpace."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Oh."
01:05:42;01:05:43;"Whoa."
01:05:43;01:05:46;"Through friends of friends, mutual contacts on MySpace."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"It's a different era."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"That's that real indie era."
01:05:50;01:05:55;"Look, if you remember the early to mid-2000s, you weren't there."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"That's what they said."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"I know."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"It's funny how vague the recollections are."
01:05:59;01:06:03;"I remember recalling venues on a landline in 1998."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"The Booker's going to be there at 3."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Call them at 3."
01:06:06;01:06:07;"The Booker."
01:06:07;01:06:11;"To play the Shea Cafe in San Diego."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"San Diego."
01:06:12;01:06:13;"But you know what's funny?"
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Like, in the scope of it, all of our ages are so similar."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"It's remarkable that each of these little micro-generations--"
01:06:20;01:06:24;"I mean, a legitimate half-generation between Ezra and Jake."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"I'm right in the middle of that."
01:06:26;01:06:32;"But, like, amazing that we each had different, you know, sort of technological experiences."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"You have how you book shows and stuff like that."
01:06:34;01:06:41;"I just remember disliking the process of having to, like, cold email people or cold call them"
01:06:41;01:06:45;"or just, like, lug all your stuff to some, like, weird venue."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"And I kind of just remember, like--"
01:06:47;01:06:50;"That was fun in high school when we'd be playing, like, church basements."
01:06:50;01:06:55;"By, like, college age, that experience of even watching it secondhand,"
01:06:55;01:07:01;"watching, like, you, Dave, have to deal with, like, aggro sound guys in, like, Buffalo or something."
01:07:01;01:07:03;"Like, this guy's having, like, a bad day."
01:07:03;01:07:06;"And you're just kind of like, ""Okay, hold on. Can we try that song again?"""
01:07:06;01:07:08;"The guy's like, ""Oh, my God."" Soundcheck."
01:07:08;01:07:14;"I just remember seeing all that stuff and just being like, ""Yeah, not going to be a musician."""
01:07:14;01:07:19;"I was like, ""I know I like music. I like messing around in the studio."
01:07:19;01:07:25;"I like listening to it and reading about it, but dealing with the sound guys and the booking the shows"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"and all that stuff, just such a nightmare."""
01:07:27;01:07:30;"Yeah. It was, like-- I thought it was fun."
01:07:30;01:07:32;"I thought it was just, like, a weird novel experience."
01:07:32;01:07:36;"I can see that now. I actually have a memory of saying to you, like, straight up, I was like,"
01:07:36;01:07:40;"""How can you, like, do this? Like, how can you, like, just deal with these, like,"
01:07:40;01:07:43;"these tense situations every single day?"""
01:07:43;01:07:45;"Just pulling in and just kind of be like--"
01:07:45;01:07:49;"People just like, ""Oh, my God. How many mics do you have?"""
01:07:49;01:07:50;"Or whatever."
01:07:50;01:07:54;"And I just remember you were like, ""You know, if someone's got a bad vibe, you know,"
01:07:54;01:07:58;"you just got to bring the cleanest energy you can, have a good attitude, and whatever."""
01:07:58;01:08:03;"And I was just thinking, like, ""How? How, Sway? How do you do that?"""
01:08:03;01:08:06;"Just at the time-- Yeah, of course I look back and I'm kind--"
01:08:06;01:08:10;"Yeah, and the idea of, like, meeting a sound guy in Buffalo is having a bad day."
01:08:10;01:08:14;"I think I would have a lot more tools in my toolbox to know how to look at that"
01:08:14;01:08:17;"and not take it personally or just, like, get through it."
01:08:17;01:08:20;"But yeah, I guess there's just something about being, like, 20 or something"
01:08:20;01:08:25;"where I was just like-- It just seemed like an impossible situation to me."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"So difficult."
01:08:27;01:08:28;"Yeah."
01:08:28;01:08:30;"There's also so much waiting, too."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"So much waiting. That's the thing that really sticks out to me about, like,"
01:08:33;01:08:39;"just really, really early touring is just, like, how there's so much downtime."
01:08:39;01:08:42;"It's so boring."
01:08:42;01:08:45;"Yeah, because you just-- You don't know how long the waiting's going to be."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"Yeah."
01:08:46;01:08:51;"I guess back then, it was kind of pre-- Definitely pre-iPhone."
01:08:51;01:08:52;"Oh, yeah."
01:08:52;01:08:55;"So I feel like I probably read a lot more books."
01:08:55;01:09:00;"I did-- I think I did break myself of motion sickness by, like, reading a book"
01:09:00;01:09:04;"in, like, a rented van on, like, an early tour."
01:09:04;01:09:08;"I was like, ""Man, this is f---ing so boring. Yeah, I need to read a book."""
01:09:08;01:09:09;"You have to learn how to do it."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"Wow."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"So just, like, push through."
01:09:11;01:09:13;"Yeah, with music on, too."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"But I've since lost that skill, like, years ago."
01:09:16;01:09:18;"Right. You would just get nauseous?"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"No, no. Like, reading with music on."
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Oh, right."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"Oh, right. I can't do that either."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Yeah."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Yeah, I feel like I was, like, tearing through books back then."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"Yeah."
01:09:27;01:09:30;"I mean, yeah, there's just, like, nothing else to do."
01:09:30;01:09:36;"Stuff that does seem, like, very distant to me now is, like, 2004, reading three Graham Green novels--"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"Wow."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"--on a Midwestern Dirty Projectors tour or something like that."
01:09:40;01:09:43;"I still like books, but-- I don't know."
01:09:43;01:09:46;"But that in particular, reading three Graham Green novels--"
01:09:46;01:09:47;"Back to back to back."
01:09:47;01:09:48;"--not gonna happen."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Yeah."
01:09:49;01:09:50;"Yeah, that's just not gonna happen."
01:09:50;01:09:51;"Yeah, with the phone in the picture, not gonna happen."
01:09:51;01:09:55;"I know. I remember, like, I think reading, like, Guns, Germs, and Steel."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"On some tour?"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"That's so hilarious."
01:10:01;01:10:07;"I mean, you could really do some damage on some of those big airport books on a long tour."
01:10:07;01:10:13;"You're just sitting in a tiny, tiny dressing room with, like, ten people for four hours,"
01:10:13;01:10:17;"just making it through 70 to 80 pages of Guns, Germs, and Steel."
01:10:17;01:10:20;"[Laughter]"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Oh, my God."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"Yeah."
01:10:23;01:10:25;"Just being like-- I'm reading about the Aztecs over here."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"Yeah."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"And then he has a very compelling theory."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"Yeah."
01:11:27;01:11:45;"I remember-- I don't think I ever finished it, but on some tour like this,"
01:11:45;01:11:49;"reading, like-- this is, like, a classic book that, like, a lot of people have and don't read,"
01:11:49;01:11:54;"is The Power Broker, the, like, thousand-page book about Robert Moses."
01:11:54;01:11:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:55;01:11:56;"Wow."
01:11:56;01:11:57;"Did you read it?"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"Yeah."
01:11:58;01:11:59;"Front to back?"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"I mean, it was in college."
01:12:00;01:12:01;"I probably skipped around a bunch."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"I mean, there's things I very specifically remember from it."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"I remember things about it, but that's just a gigantic book."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"I mean, I know this is a hyper-specific experience to me,"
01:12:08;01:12:12;"but I feel like there's probably somebody listening, another silverback millennial who feels it."
01:12:12;01:12:17;"There's something about that book, The Power Broker, just makes me feel like '04, '05,"
01:12:17;01:12:23;"being in some random-ass place on page 205, just like, ""Mmm."""
01:12:23;01:12:25;"[Laughter]"
01:12:25;01:12:27;"Reading about, like, the Erie Canal."
01:12:27;01:12:28;"[Laughter]"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Exactly."
01:12:29;01:12:32;"I could just-- it feels, like, so real."
01:12:32;01:12:37;"And I could totally see that, too, as just, like, being in a car, like, music class, just like, ""Mmm."""
01:12:37;01:12:39;"I'm not suffering."
01:12:39;01:12:43;"In 1942, Moses decided--"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"Do you have a copy in your house?"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"I bet that's in a storage facility somewhere."
01:12:47;01:12:52;"But, yeah, at the time, I remember feeling like a loser because I only read 50% of it."
01:12:52;01:12:53;"Yeah."
01:12:53;01:12:58;"Whereas today, I feel like it's the type of book I would read maybe, like, the first--"
01:12:58;01:12:59;"I could totally--"
01:12:59;01:13:02;"You're getting to 100 pages, 120."
01:13:02;01:13:07;"There's a book I got-- I realized how little I knew about the Crusades."
01:13:07;01:13:12;"So I was, like, looking up best books about the Crusades, and I found one."
01:13:12;01:13:13;"It's so dense."
01:13:13;01:13:14;"It's not fully academic."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"It's made for the layperson to read, but it's still so dense."
01:13:17;01:13:21;"If you really wanted to take it in, you really have to chew on every paragraph."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"And it was also hilarious."
01:13:23;01:13:25;"I guess it's also like being older and having a kid."
01:13:25;01:13:29;"Just no joke, reading half a page and falling asleep every night."
01:13:29;01:13:30;"Oh, my God, yeah."
01:13:30;01:13:31;"Over and over again."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"[Laughter]"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"You bought me that tiny book about time."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"Oh, right."
01:13:36;01:13:37;"Oh, I got that for you and Jake."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"Yeah, and, I mean, it's taken me-- I mean, I did it."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"It's, again, it's a--"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"And that's an insane book."
01:13:42;01:13:43;"And every-- yeah."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"Oh, that's one."
01:13:44;01:13:48;"You're going two pages, and you're learning about time expanding or shrinking,"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"and you're just like, ""I got to go back."""
01:13:50;01:13:52;"And it's like, yeah, 9 20 p.m."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"[Laughter]"
01:13:54;01:13:55;"You're just like, ""Sleep."""
01:13:55;01:13:57;"That sounds like the gift of sleep."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Yeah."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"It never works that you want it, though."
01:14:00;01:14:01;"Yeah."
01:14:01;01:14:05;"I mean, books are-- if you're keeping it real with yourself, everybody knows that feeling."
01:14:05;01:14:06;"You're like-- you know you're tired."
01:14:06;01:14:08;"You know you need sleep."
01:14:08;01:14:11;"And the next thing you know, you're like, ""What should we mention?"""
01:14:11;01:14:12;"Yeah."
01:14:12;01:14:14;"""Should we watch one more episode?"""
01:14:14;01:14:15;"And, like, keep it real."
01:14:15;01:14:18;"You should be reading a 1,200-page book about the Aztecs."
01:14:18;01:14:19;"Two pages at a time."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Yeah."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"I love this idea of you in bed reading The Power Broker."
01:14:23;01:14:25;"[Laughter]"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"And your son is basically coming in every single night, and he's like,"
01:14:28;01:14:34;"""I just remember basically for the first 14 years of my life, my entire childhood,"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"I'd walk and say goodnight to my dad, and he was reading some book called The Power Broker."""
01:14:37;01:14:38;"Oh, my God."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"It took him 12 years to read the book."
01:14:39;01:14:40;"No, that's so funny."
01:14:40;01:14:45;"Yeah, it's like your son is now like 25, 30, and he's like,"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"""My dad was a very intellectual guy."
01:14:47;01:14:48;"Always had a book in his hand."""
01:14:48;01:14:49;"And you're like, ""Really?"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"What kind of stuff was he reading?"""
01:14:51;01:14:52;"One book in particular."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"He was a very smart guy."
01:14:54;01:14:58;"He wasn't reading just, like, you know, flavor of the month pop psychology books."
01:14:58;01:15:02;"He read serious, you know, works like The Power Broker about Robert Moses."
01:15:02;01:15:03;"I mean, that's a huge book."
01:15:03;01:15:08;"And he starts, like, reflecting, and he's like, ""I mean, I would always walk into his bedroom."""
01:15:08;01:15:11;"He was going to fall asleep with it on his chest, and he started doing the math."
01:15:11;01:15:16;"He's like, ""Remember when I was four and seven, 12, and 18?"""
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Hang on a second."
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Wait a second."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"He was on the same page of that book for 20 years."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"Oh, I'm freaking out right now."
01:15:23;01:15:24;"12."
01:15:24;01:15:25;"Oh, my God."
01:15:25;01:15:26;"What?"
01:15:26;01:15:32;"My dad never read The Power Broker."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"He was always talking about this one anecdote."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"He always would talk about this one anecdote."
01:15:37;01:15:38;"Actually, it's funny."
01:15:38;01:15:43;"When I think about that book now, what comes to mind, I kind of remember--"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"Okay, the one thing I remember that's, like, important is that--"
01:15:46;01:15:47;"Okay, TC Book Club."
01:15:48;01:15:54;"The one important thing I remember is that when he built one of these, like, famous beaches on Long Island--"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"Yes, this is the only thing I remember, too."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"--he made--because he's famous--oh, wait, you remember, too."
01:15:58;01:15:59;"Yes."
01:15:59;01:16:05;"He famously was a racist, and he didn't want black people to be able to come to the same beach as white people."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"It's not Fire Island."
01:16:06;01:16:09;"It might just be Long Beach or something in Long Island."
01:16:09;01:16:19;"But he made sure that the overpass was too low for buses to drive there so that people who use public transportation could not get dropped off there."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"So that's one of the important things that I remember."
01:16:21;01:16:24;"One of the unimportant things I remember is that he loved to swim."
01:16:24;01:16:28;"[laughter]"
01:16:28;01:16:32;"They interviewed his daughter, and she was just like, ""Oh, my dad loved to swim."""
01:16:32;01:16:40;"Oh, yeah, any time we'd be anywhere near a lake or something, he'd be, you know, first day of summer, jump in that lake, swim in every day."
01:16:40;01:16:43;"That's when Isaiah's talking to someone, he goes, ""Yeah, I just--my daddy loved to read."""
01:16:43;01:16:45;"[laughter]"
01:16:45;01:16:46;"Loved to read."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"That's the only thing I know."
01:16:47;01:16:55;"Somebody's, like, talking about, like, the history of, like, New York and the controversy of Robert Moses and just, like, oh, yeah, what--"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"you know, did you know that he wanted to build a highway straight through Greenwich Village?"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"Can you believe that?"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"He'd be like, ""The man loved to swim."""
01:17:02;01:17:04;"[laughter]"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"The guy was--he couldn't get enough."
01:17:07;01:17:11;"One thing about--one thing I always think about Robert Moses, love to swim."
01:17:11;01:17:12;"Loved to swim."
01:17:12;01:17:14;"[laughter]"
01:17:14;01:17:15;"All right."
01:17:15;01:17:16;"I guess we got to wrap this up."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Thanks so much for coming on."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"Yeah, my pleasure."
01:17:19;01:17:20;"Thanks for having me."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Yeah, come back soon."
01:17:22;01:17:23;"We'll get into some other stuff."
01:17:23;01:17:24;"Yeah, for sure."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"But appreciate that."
01:17:26;01:17:27;"Yeah."
01:17:27;01:17:28;"All right, talk soon, dude."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Take it easy, guys."
01:17:29;01:17:30;"Bye, Wes."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"Bye."
01:17:34;01:17:40;"How long am I supposed to wait? I think about you nightly."
01:17:40;01:17:47;"Oh, can you tell I'm losing sleep? Oh, what am I supposed to do?"
01:17:47;01:17:53;"It's hard to stay cool. Oh, when you smile at me,"
01:17:53;01:18:01;"and I get nervous every time you speak, my bed's too big for just me."
01:18:01;01:18:07;"When you turn your eyes, I promise I won't care."
01:18:07;01:18:14;"Oh, standing by your sister there. Oh, baby, baby, baby, please."
01:18:14;01:18:21;"My heart sings to my feet. Oh, what am I supposed to do?"
01:18:21;01:18:28;"I think about you nightly. My bed's too big for just me."
01:18:28;01:18:34;"When you turn your eyes, I promise I won't care."
01:18:34;01:18:41;"Oh, standing by your sister there. Oh, standing by your sister there."
01:18:41;01:18:45;"Oh, standing by your sister there."
01:18:45;01:18:49;"So on the last episode, we dipped into some of your guys' band,"
01:18:49;01:18:52;"the Longstreth Brothers Band, called American People."
01:18:52;01:18:56;"Well, that does beg the question, how can we just call it the Longstreth Brothers Band?"
01:18:56;01:19:00;"You know, the quote was-- We thought of ourselves foremost as American people."
01:19:00;01:19:04;"Well, I remember the quote was from Bob Dole. Oh, yeah."
01:19:04;01:19:08;"When he was running in '96, ""I know it, you know it, the American people know it."""
01:19:08;01:19:11;"And Dave would always walk around going, 14-year-old Dave would be going,"
01:19:11;01:19:15;"""I know it, you know it, the American people know it."""
01:19:15;01:19:19;"Must have been during the, you know, in summer '96 Republican Convention."
01:19:19;01:19:24;"Was that, which we watched avidly. No, but I mean, it was just kind of, yeah, exactly."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"That's where it came from. American people."
01:19:27;01:19:32;"Yeah, I mean, for a 14-year-old, and I guess I was 12,"
01:19:32;01:19:35;"couldn't think of like a funnier figure than Bob Dole."
01:19:35;01:19:38;"Yeah, totally. Just being like a young person."
01:19:38;01:19:43;"Like, I imagine now if I watch some videos of Bob Dole, I'd probably see a lot more pathos"
01:19:43;01:19:46;"and have like sympathy for like, man, I wonder what-- I'd probably think,"
01:19:46;01:19:50;"just at the time, just like, ""Oh my God, this guy sucks."""
01:19:50;01:19:53;"I mean, I might still think he sucks, but I just think I'd probably be like,"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"""I wonder where he served in the military."""
01:19:55;01:19:59;"I'd be way more interested in this. What did he go through during World War II?"
01:19:59;01:20:01;"Really? Wow. I just think at the time, when you're young,"
01:20:01;01:20:05;"you see a dude like Bob Dole and he-- what was it? His arm was messed up?"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"Yeah, he'd-- He was always holding-- He sort of had to keep his arm at his side."
01:20:08;01:20:11;"Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah, and I feel like kids would just be like,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"""Oh, did you see that? He's a million years old."""
01:20:13;01:20:15;"It's also, I feel like there was probably a Saturday Night Live"
01:20:15;01:20:19;"where they were really exaggerating, which feels real ableist, but--"
01:20:19;01:20:22;"It was always Norm MacDonald and he was holding the pencil, right?"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"'Cause that was Bob Dole's, like-- To keep his hand."
01:20:24;01:20:26;"Thing, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I wonder if I went back"
01:20:26;01:20:30;"and watched a Bill Clinton versus Bob Dole debate now, what I would see."
01:20:30;01:20:33;"Hmm. Hmm. Only one way to find out."
01:20:33;01:20:36;"That'd be an interesting episode. Was Ross Perot in that election, too?"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"No, it was '92. That was '92? Wow."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"Yeah, that's what helped Bill Clinton win. But anyway, so--"
01:20:40;01:20:44;"Next time somebody wants to watch Vanderpump Rules, say, ""I have a better idea."""
01:20:44;01:20:47;"'96 presidential debates."
01:20:47;01:20:48;"[laughter]"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"Primary debate."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"""Hey, babe, I got an idea for something for us to watch tonight."""
01:20:53;01:20:56;"'96 presidential debates. Clinton, no."
01:20:56;01:20:58;"I bet it would be so fascinating. I bet it would."
01:20:58;01:21:00;"I bet it would be so slow. Yeah."
01:21:00;01:21:04;"The vibe of it would be so-- Anyway, so I forgot about that, Jake."
01:21:04;01:21:08;"Yeah. So then, yeah, we started-- I think that was summer '96"
01:21:08;01:21:13;"and then we made another album, AP2, in late '96, early '97,"
01:21:13;01:21:17;"and that was where it got more-- less jokey, more real."
01:21:17;01:21:24;"Very influenced by classical music, but also lo-fi '90s stuff."
01:21:24;01:21:27;"So throw in, like, ""When You Go to--"" Let's just play a few songs of AP2."
01:21:27;01:21:29;"They're all really short. All right."
01:21:29;01:21:32;"And the album's straight up called AP2? Yeah. Zeppelin style."
01:21:32;01:21:37;"So just do, like, ""When I Go to the Store"" or ""Oh, and when you go,"""
01:21:37;01:21:39;"and then bring it back. It's funny to think about this,"
01:21:39;01:21:45;"but we had stories where we really felt like the first American People album"
01:21:45;01:21:49;"was, like, very clean, lots of bright, colorful tones."
01:21:49;01:21:53;"Yeah. And with American People 2, we wanted to go darker."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Hmm. [laughs]"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"Already thinking like a career artist. Yeah."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"It's so funny. Okay, so here's ""When You Go to the Store."""
01:22:00;01:22:02;"[playing ""When You Go to the Store""]"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"Dave's on piano, I'm on guitar, Dave's singing."
01:22:04;01:22:10;"[playing ""When You Go to the Store""]"
01:22:10;01:22:17;"# Oh, and when you go to the store"
01:22:17;01:22:27;"# I find that I am much more, much more, much more used to my friend"

01:22:30;01:22:39;"# Oh, and when you go to the blazing Tundra slope"
01:22:39;01:22:46;"# I think you will find that I know"
01:22:46;01:22:51;"# I think you will find that I know #"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"[playing ""When You Go to the Store""]"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"Interesting. What's the reference for that?"
01:22:58;01:22:59;"I don't know. Some weird--"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"Revolver? Yeah, maybe."
01:23:01;01:23:03;"But, like, way more dissonant. Yeah."
01:23:03;01:23:04;"Beautiful."
01:23:04;01:23:06;"And then that song ""Bring It Back"" was when--"
01:23:06;01:23:11;"I used to write, like, fake baroque-- like, fake Bach songs on the guitar."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"Because I was really into, like, Bach tablature when I was in college,"
01:23:14;01:23:15;"because I was a really cool guy."
01:23:15;01:23:17;"Yeah. I mean, that is a cool thing to be into."
01:23:17;01:23:19;"And so-- Dissing yourself about that?"
01:23:19;01:23:20;"Just joking."
01:23:20;01:23:21;"What? In, like, '96?"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Yeah, so then this song ""Bring It Back"" is like--"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"it's another, like, minute-long song."
01:23:25;01:23:27;"Dave's on drums, and I just, like--"
01:23:27;01:23:30;"we recorded, like, my instrumental fake Bach,"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"and then we sang over it."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Like, lyrically, it feeds into what we're talking about"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"with the strokes a little bit,"
01:23:36;01:23:40;"in that I think you're sort of, like, skeptical"
01:23:40;01:23:44;"of this '90s phenomenon of, like, bringing--"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"just retro mania."
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Oh, interesting."
01:23:46;01:23:49;"Bringing things back, so you're sort of, like, annoyed about that."

01:38:13;01:38:17;"yeah, it kind of sounds like the Beach Boys, but interesting."

01:38:54;01:38:55;"And he makes these like long--"
01:38:55;01:38:57;"Oh, I know who you're talking about."
01:38:57;01:38:58;"Dawson."
01:38:58;01:38:59;"Maybe Richard Dawson."
01:38:59;01:39:00;"I love that guy."
01:39:00;01:39:03;"Yeah, because he has these like long, weird songs that have like--"

01:40:09;01:40:13;"like very sophisticated music played sloppily"

01:40:37;01:40:40;"I think that we had our parents' record collection,"

01:40:41;01:40:47;"And I knew of the music that Jake brought to the house."

01:40:51;01:40:53;"I was super into Brian Wilson."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"And I think I had an idea that it would be kind of cool"

01:41:00;01:41:01;"Good idea."
01:41:01;01:41:02;"You still feel that way?"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Yeah."
01:41:03;01:41:06;"I mean, it is funny listening to these, because it's like, oh,"

01:41:09;01:41:10;"Yeah, it's deep, though."

01:41:18;01:41:19;"damn, what?"
01:41:19;01:41:23;"Did you check out the piano record that he put out,"

01:46:10;01:46:11;"23."
01:46:11;01:46:14;"So I feel like ""Glad Fact"" is probably stuff"

01:47:53;01:47:54;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"Do you remember what year it was?"
01:47:56;01:48:01;"Like Rostam was like subletting a place that was like"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"right off McCarran Park."
01:48:03;01:48:06;"And I came-- you guys had me over,"
01:48:06;01:48:10;"and it was like rough versions of ""Oxford Combo"""
01:48:10;01:48:11;"and ""Cape Cod Cuasa Cuasa."""
01:48:11;01:48:16;"I feel like that might have been maybe right after we graduated."
01:48:16;01:48:19;"He might have been subletting that place that summer."
01:48:19;01:48:23;"And like maybe we kind of moved into that house in bed style"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"like a few months later."
01:48:24;01:48:25;"That would make sense."
01:48:25;01:48:26;"It would be all that era."
01:48:26;01:48:28;"And I remember just being like, whoa, like what?"
01:48:28;01:48:31;"Yeah, because I remember the first demos we made--"
01:48:31;01:48:35;"I was actually in my Teach for America training around the time"
01:48:35;01:48:37;"because I remember listening to them."
01:48:37;01:48:40;"And when we first made a demo of ""Cape Cod Cuasa Cuasa"""
01:48:40;01:48:42;"and ""Oxford Combo,"" which really is not that different"
01:48:42;01:48:43;"than what ended up on the record."
01:48:43;01:48:44;"For sure."
01:48:44;01:48:48;"I just kind of remember being like, OK, this kind of feels real."
01:48:48;01:48:50;"This is the other like early--"
01:48:50;01:48:53;"[MUSIC - ""CAPE CODA CUSA""]"
01:48:53;01:48:55;"Oh, yeah."
01:48:55;01:48:57;"This kind of has a Walkman."
01:48:57;01:48:58;"I was going to say."
01:48:58;01:49:00;"Yeah, actually, I was thinking about this."
01:49:00;01:49:03;"I think this song, especially because I was 19 here,"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"and like I was saying, me and Wes, we got like super into Walkman"
01:49:06;01:49:07;"around like 17."
01:49:07;01:49:10;"[MUSIC - ""CAPE CODA CUSA""]"
01:49:10;01:49:17;"I stand."
01:49:17;01:49:22;"I also thought this was the most rock song of the VW stuff,"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"the early stuff."
01:49:24;01:49:26;"Even just like--"
01:49:26;01:49:27;"Stand."
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Yeah."
01:49:29;01:49:30;"It's very like--"
01:49:30;01:49:31;"Yeah, it's very like Hamilton."
01:49:31;01:49:33;"You can imagine him."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Or even like Interpol or like--"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"I don't know, just like stand."
01:49:38;01:49:42;"Well, I remember when we started working on the song for Vampire Weekend,"
01:49:42;01:49:45;"I was like--"
01:49:45;01:49:49;"because I had like my manifesto of, well, we should wear button-down shirts"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"and be preppy and stuff."
01:49:50;01:49:51;"Amazing."
01:49:51;01:49:54;"But I remember one of my insights, I was like,"
01:49:54;01:49:57;"you know one band that wore button-down shirts?"
01:49:57;01:49:58;"Joy Division."
01:49:58;01:49:59;"Oh."
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I was like, preppy Joy Division."
01:50:01;01:50:02;"OK."
01:50:02;01:50:04;"No, but you're totally right that--"
01:50:04;01:50:07;"I could totally picture at this age starting to think differently about"
01:50:07;01:50:11;"songwriting and being like, I really like the Walkman."
01:50:11;01:50:14;"What's up with these guys' lyrics?"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"And being like--"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"just in a very kind of naive, simple way, being like,"
01:50:17;01:50:19;"well, they're kind of like young guys, but they like--"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"why do they seem like 100 years old?"
01:50:21;01:50:27;"And it's because Hamilton always used like funny old phrases."
01:50:27;01:50:29;"And I think in my head, I was like--"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"I think that's literally how this happened."
01:50:30;01:50:32;"I was probably sitting at my parents' house in New Jersey"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"summer after freshman year and just be like,"
01:50:34;01:50:38;"what's like some funny old phrase, like a Hamilton-esque"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"or a Walkman-esque thing?"
01:50:39;01:50:42;"And I think I was like, I stand corrected is pretty funny."
01:50:42;01:50:45;"And then I was like, I--"
01:50:45;01:50:46;"That's funny."
01:50:46;01:50:49;"--stand corrected."
01:50:49;01:50:52;"You just hear like your uncle being like, well, I stand corrected."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Yeah, just like--"
01:50:53;01:51:00;"Yeah, because also I feel like early Walkman songs just like--"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"what's in it for me?"
01:51:02;01:51:05;"It's not that old of a phrase, but like--"
01:51:05;01:51:07;"I think that straight up is like a combination of like a little bit"
01:51:07;01:51:11;"of like Walkman and then Ian Curtis."
01:51:11;01:51:14;"I stand corrected."
01:51:14;01:51:16;"I just had an idea for a song that goes--"
01:51:16;01:51:21;"that's the lyric, and I just can't stress this enough."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"And I just can't stress this enough."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"Yeah, right."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Definitely, you need to like--"
01:51:27;01:51:28;"It's like a Huey Lewis song."
01:51:28;01:51:29;"It could be one of those songs where--"
01:51:29;01:51:31;"And I just can't stress this enough."
01:51:31;01:51:33;"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"Every verse is different, you know, a different kind of tier"
01:51:36;01:51:39;"of thing, but then it just ends, and I just can't stress this enough."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"It's almost like it could be like a Robert Palmer '80s song."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"Just like, you might as well face it, you're addicted to love."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Right."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"But this one's like--"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"He's just adamantly telling you--"
01:51:48;01:51:49;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:51:49;01:51:52;"Because I love you."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"It's real live."
01:51:53;01:51:57;"Because I love you, and I just can't stress this enough."
01:51:57;01:52:00;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:52:00;01:52:03;"You're a beautiful woman."
01:52:03;01:52:06;"And I'm a desperate man."
01:52:06;01:52:12;"American Psycho kind of boardroom talk, but used in sort of a--"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"you know, a love--"
01:52:13;01:52:15;"to express your love."
01:52:15;01:52:21;"It's time to close this deal, and I just can't stress this enough."
01:52:21;01:52:25;"[VOCALIZING]"
01:52:25;01:52:27;"It's a great Mountain Brew song."
01:52:27;01:52:28;"Oh, yeah."
01:52:28;01:52:29;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:52:29;01:52:33;"Those are the-- just before the Vampire Weekend days,"
01:52:33;01:52:35;"I kind of remember doing those."
01:52:35;01:52:36;"So of course--"
01:52:36;01:52:37;"That's cool."
01:52:37;01:52:38;"Of course, those kind of--"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"So cool to hear those."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"Yeah, so there was like those ones just laying back in the cut"
01:52:42;01:52:43;"for a couple of years."
01:52:43;01:52:47;"And then I always think, like, for me, it was in like one weekend,"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"back at my parents' house in Jersey."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"Just sat down-- somewhere I have a demo of just me at the piano."
01:52:52;01:52:55;"It's going, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."
01:52:55;01:52:58;"I go, we [BLEEP] at an Oxford comma."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"Because I was just like, that was just what unlocked it."
01:53:00;01:53:04;"You could see like gestures of it, but there was like Oxford comma"
01:53:04;01:53:08;"and then Walcott, which luckily I had both, because if it was like"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"just Walcott, that ties way back more into just like that"
01:53:11;01:53:15;"like slightly soft Morrick, just like, at a game card tonight."
01:53:15;01:53:16;"Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."
01:53:16;01:53:19;"But then Oxford comma, I felt like was like opening up something"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"a little more sophisticated."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"And then we were off to the races."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"Wait, can I play one more?"
01:53:24;01:53:25;"Please."
01:53:25;01:53:29;"This is the last one on this selection of--"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"I don't know."
01:53:30;01:53:31;"--the selection that Jake brought in."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"I just sent a bunch of songs over."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Fictitious Inventions."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"Oh, yeah, that's a good one."
01:53:35;01:53:39;"This is like another kind of like Brian Wilson-y."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"When I listened to it more recently, I was like, oh, like,"
01:53:42;01:53:45;"my idea hasn't changed that much."
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Dave's on piano, I'm on guitar on this one."
01:53:47;01:53:50;"[MUSIC - DAVE BROWN, ""FICTITIOUS INVENTIONS""]"
01:53:50;01:53:53;"Ooh, nice panning."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"Yeah, bouncing around."
01:53:55;01:53:58;"[MUSIC - DAVE BROWN, ""FICTITIOUS INVENTIONS""]"
01:53:58;01:54:13;"These are the fictitious inventions of jealousy."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"And now--"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"Of jealousy?"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"--this is the beginning."
01:54:18;01:54:22;"Did we revenge the sea?"
01:54:22;01:54:27;"It's formed our pores all over me."
01:54:27;01:54:30;"[MUSIC - DAVE BROWN, ""FICTITIOUS INVENTIONS""]"
01:54:30;01:54:47;"It's funny."
01:54:47;01:54:49;"There's like a touch of Dirty Projectors in there,"
01:54:49;01:54:52;"but there's like a theatricality that he left behind."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Yeah."
01:54:53;01:54:56;"See, it's funny, too, because I feel like I remember in the early days,"
01:54:56;01:54:59;"people always asked you if you liked Zappa, and you always said, hell no."
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Yeah."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"You still feel that way?"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"I mean, I don't think I really heard--"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"I don't think I've heard that much Frank Zappa."
01:55:05;01:55:10;"See, because even that has a touch of like some of his like weird operatic--"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"Nah."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Were you a fan of Joan of Arc?"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"They're from Chicago?"
01:55:13;01:55:14;"Yeah."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"There's like a Thrill Jockey band?"
01:55:15;01:55:16;"Yeah, yeah."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"I've never really heard that much."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"Sounds very similar to me."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"Really?"
01:55:19;01:55:20;"Similar vibe."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"I thought Joan of Arc was like a punk band."
01:55:21;01:55:22;"It's sort of like this."
01:55:22;01:55:23;"Yeah, I thought that, too."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"It feels like slightly all over the place."
01:55:25;01:55:27;"I mean, and maybe it's just Tim's other stuff, but--"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"Why would they get into some--"
01:55:28;01:55:29;"I mean, like put on--"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"I was just like, put on I Was Born."
01:55:31;01:55:38;"Because wait, like Zappa, like my dad thought we were only in it for the money"
01:55:38;01:55:42;"was just hilarious, and he would throw it on sometimes,"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"and it just wasn't funny."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Yeah."
01:55:45;01:55:46;"I don't know."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"I never vibed with Zappa."
01:55:48;01:55:54;"And then my friend James Sumner really rides for Jazz from Hell."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"Is this Joan of Arc?"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"Jazz from Hell is crazy."
01:55:58;01:56:00;"It's bizarre and forward thinking."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"And honestly, like that's kind of the Zappa that I know."
01:56:03;01:56:04;"Right."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"Those two things."
01:56:06;01:56:10;"And like I love the spectrum across those two things."
01:56:14;01:56:18;"But Zappa has a persona I don't really like."
01:56:18;01:56:23;"See, I like watching Zappa YouTubes, like his interviews."
01:56:23;01:56:26;"Zappa like Senate testimony is amazing."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"Yeah."
01:56:27;01:56:28;"So inspiring."
01:56:28;01:56:29;"[MUSIC - ZAPPA, ""I'M NOT THE ONE""]"
01:56:29;01:56:34;"(SINGING) Never enough of all the things you want."
01:56:34;01:56:38;"Early Zappa, they're definitely cut to somebody playing weird piano chords."
01:56:38;01:56:41;"Maybe because I-- you know."
01:56:41;01:56:42;"This is tight."
01:56:42;01:56:44;"This is tight."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"It's how worlds apart."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"I miss this."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"Well, I'm not really hearing the connection, but this sounds cool."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"I like that this is what you thought of."
01:56:51;01:56:52;"This is like--"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"I haven't seen it in a long time since I've listened to this."
01:56:54;01:56:55;"Is this Midwest emo?"
01:56:55;01:56:56;"Kind of."
01:56:56;01:56:57;"You know what?"
01:56:57;01:56:59;"Maybe like Pedro the Lion."
01:56:59;01:57:00;"Do you remember?"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"Did you ever hear them?"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"Yeah, yeah."
01:57:02;01:57:03;"I loved them."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"That first Pedro record is a classic."
01:57:04;01:57:06;"Well, thanks for coming through, Dave."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"Thanks to Wes."
01:57:08;01:57:13;"It's been a great walk into the past as we explore the youth and young manhood."
01:57:13;01:57:15;"Long journey into the past."
01:57:15;01:57:18;"And let's go out with some jazz from hell from Frank Zappa."
01:57:18;01:57:21;"If you don't know this, this is like this insane album he made in the '80s."
01:57:21;01:57:25;"It's basically like synth computer jazz."
01:57:25;01:57:26;"It's like MIDI."
01:57:26;01:57:27;"Yeah."
01:57:27;01:57:28;"OK, it sounds insane."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"Anyway--"
01:57:29;01:57:30;"It is hellacious."
01:57:30;01:57:34;"I feel like there's a very specific thing about a dad telling his son,"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"like, you just got to listen to this."
01:57:35;01:57:37;"But specifically, not I like it, but I find it so funny."
01:57:37;01:57:38;"Yeah."
01:57:38;01:57:40;"And you're just like, Dad, this sucks."
01:57:40;01:57:44;"I did feel-- and I grew up-- that's how my dad felt about the Fuggs."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Oh, right."
01:57:45;01:57:46;"Yeah."
01:57:46;01:57:48;"But I just remember being like, this is so funny."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"And he was like, no."
01:57:50;01:57:51;"Yeah."
01:57:51;01:57:52;"Ted, no."
01:57:52;01:57:53;"Frank Zappa, similar."
01:57:53;01:57:58;"Yeah, well, that's why-- don't play that early Frank Zappa funny stuff for your kids."
01:57:58;01:57:59;"Play them jazz from hell."
01:57:59;01:58:01;"He also did love-- we've talked about it--"
01:58:01;01:58:04;"he loved Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jew Boys."
01:58:04;01:58:05;"And that always landed."
01:58:05;01:58:06;"Yeah, Kinky Friedman holds up."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"Don't start your son with mothers of invention."
01:58:09;01:58:12;"Say, all right, son, it's time to listen to jazz from hell."
01:58:12;01:58:13;"We'll see you in a couple weeks."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Here's some jazz from hell."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"Frank Zappa with the Beltway Bandits."
01:59:05;01:59:10;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
