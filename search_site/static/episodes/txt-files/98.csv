00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. We reunite for the first time in many moons. We catch up"
00:08;00:16;"on life, love, and rock and roll. We talk beef, wean and fish, 1975 and Imagine"
00:16;00:22;"Dragons, maybe even a little Trent Reznor. All this plus the top five songs"
00:22;00:30;"this is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:14;01:21;"Time Crisis back for real. Can you believe it Jake? A non-banked ep. Crazy."
01:21;01:27;"Feels good. The boys are back in town. Guess who just got back? You just got"
01:27;01:31;"back. Guess who just got back today? Them wild-eyed boys that have been away."
01:31;01:36;"Haven't changed that much to say, but man I still think them cats are crazy. This"
01:36;01:40;"is the longest I've been gone from LA in a very long time. Almost three months. I"
01:40;01:45;"was thinking I think the last time we taped a proper ep. No we did the Chicago"
01:45;01:49;"episode. Right so we saw each other in Chicago. In June. I haven't seen you since"
01:49;01:54;"Chicago, but before that I think it had been like April. Yeah. Seinfeld's back too."
01:54;01:58;"Hey what's up? Yeah this is a full reunion because Seinfeld missed Chicago. Yeah it's"
01:58;02:03;"been a minute. Great to see you. Yeah why'd you miss Chicago? It's just life. Yeah. I don't know I can't"
02:03;02:07;"remember. I had something. You're a working man. I was yeah. Family man. You know all"
02:07;02:12;"that sh*t. Alright well Seinfeld, are the fans enjoying the banked eps? Has there been like a"
02:12;02:17;"revolt against the banked eps? Yeah I think people were pretty upset that the"
02:17;02:22;"most recent ep was a rerun. Wasn't even banked. I saw that. Yeah there was some"
02:22;02:26;"consternation. A little bit of pushback. Yeah. So that's like the first straight"
02:26;02:31;"up rerun we've had in in our whole tenure kind of? Ever. Yeah. Outside of like"
02:31;02:35;"Christmas or something. That's right. But I mean Seinfeld was in reruns even while"
02:35;02:39;"they were making new episodes. It was in syndication so. Oh but even back in the"
02:39;02:45;"day when you'd, I mean I'm dating myself here, but I used to watch TV. You used to"
02:45;02:50;"have to go down into the living room and you'd turn on this big box thing. Yeah."
02:50;02:55;"Grab a clicker. The clicker weighed like a cement block. You gotta push the button."
02:55;03:01;"Yeah. I even remember rotary dials. Remember those? On phones? Oh no. Vaguely. I'm about"
03:01;03:04;"15 years younger than you. I don't remember those. That's not true. Yeah maybe at"
03:04;03:09;"grandma's house. Alright. Jake do you call it a clicker or remote control? Remote. You"
03:09;03:12;"don't like clicker? Never been a fan. Didn't have a clicker slash remote"
03:12;03:20;"growing up. What? But you had a TV? Yeah. A small 13-inch. Ugh. My parents were like"
03:20;03:24;"intellectual hippies. We weren't allowed to watch TV on the weeknights. Damn. Until"
03:24;03:31;"when? Like always? When I got into baseball. I could watch baseball games during high school."
03:31;03:36;"But you know what? What's up? WPIX channel 11. Oh yeah we got that. Yankee game would"
03:36;03:45;"end. Guess what came on at 11? Seinfeld. Nice. WPIX was a great station for people in the"
03:45;03:49;"tri-state area. There was a while where Monday through Friday, it's before they started having"
03:49;03:54;"original programming. I think it became the WB network and then the CW. Oh really? Yeah"
03:54;03:58;"but it used to be one of these just random channels. It was like a grab bag channel."
03:58;04:04;"Local regional channel. That didn't really do like original programming. There was news."
04:04;04:08;"They had news and then it was just kind of like you know weird maybe like people's court"
04:08;04:12;"that kind of just random syndicated show. And every night at 8 they would just show"
04:12;04:17;"a movie. Right. And it would just be like terrible movies. Or like Back to the Future."
04:17;04:23;"I don't know if it was ever. I remember like taping movies on the VCR off a TV. Oh definitely."
04:23;04:27;"Taping like PeeWee's Big Adventure. And trying to stop at the commercials. Yeah. I didn't"
04:27;04:31;"know you had that such a restrictive. Media diet. Relationship with TV. Cause our big"
04:31;04:36;"thing growing up is that we didn't have cable. So I thought already I was suffering. I thought"
04:36;04:41;"that was crazy. So we just had you know the 10 channels. See now I'm thinking it through."
04:41;04:45;"My family was inconsistent cause we had cable. You just weren't allowed to watch it very"
04:45;04:50;"often. Yeah. My dad would be watching like A&E like British Mysteries. Oh yeah? But here's"
04:50;04:56;"the thing. I remember like in high school. Yeah. Like 9th grade. I'd get home from school."
04:56;05:00;"No one would be home. So you watch whatever you want. MTV dude. Did you have HBO? No."
05:00;05:07;"Oh you didn't have premium? No. Cable. You had basic cable. MTV. Sports Channel. Yeah."
05:07;05:11;"MSG Network. To watch the Yankees. Comedy Central. Wait so Ezra when you didn't have"
05:11;05:17;"cable. Yeah. You have 10 channels still? Yeah we had like CBS. That seems a lot. NBC. CBS"
05:17;05:24;"NBC. Fox. ABC. Then you had at least in New Jersey you had Channel 9 and Channel 11 that"
05:24;05:28;"were two random grab bag channels. UPN right? Or CW? These are the regional channels that"
05:28;05:35;"became UPN and CW. In New Jersey we're getting very specific. Channel 9 was tight WWOR. Yeah"
05:35;05:39;"they would have weird stuff like that. Yeah WWR, WPX. They were similar grab bag channels."
05:39;05:44;"Cause Channel 9 showed the Mets. There you go. If you're not from the tri-state area"
05:44;05:49;"you can just turn off this episode. Just yeah. Yeah so we had those five. Then we had Channel"
05:49;05:55;"9, Channel 11. Then you had PBS. And then Univision. Oh yeah. People talk about how"
05:55;06:02;"you know attention spans have changed. I vividly remember being 12 or something. Flipping through"
06:02;06:07;"let's say the 11 channels that we got. And then you know just straight up watching like"
06:07;06:12;"I'm not gonna pretend that I would watch Univision for hours. But I could picture being 12. Like"
06:12;06:16;"it's also funny now in the internet era where like nobody, myself included, would watch"
06:16;06:20;"anything for more than three seconds. Right. That wasn't gripping. I think there were probably"
06:20;06:27;"times I took down a solid 35 minutes of Univision. Like fully in Spanish. Spanish language soap"
06:27;06:32;"opera. Not understanding a word. Well there's the soap operas I would sometimes get into."
06:32;06:37;"Sometimes there'd be Mexican Wrestling which ruled. But then also the I see it referenced"
06:37;06:42;"a lot. I remember watching it when I was that age. It's kind of like a talk show variety"
06:42;06:48;"show called Sabado. I don't know how to pronounce it. Gigante. How do you say it? Gigante? Saturday."
06:48;06:54;"What? I guess gigantic. Who speaks Spanish in here? It would be Sabado Gigante is what"
06:54;06:58;"it would be. Okay this show's called Sabado. This is like a major show. Sabado Gigante."
06:58;07:03;"Nobody in this room has seen Sabado Gigante. Don't know it. Wow. It's been running since"
07:03;07:11;"1963. Oh really? Wow. And it ended in 2015. What is this? Is it news? No it was kind of"
07:11;07:14;"like. It's a variety show. I could never fully understand what was going on. But there'd"
07:14;07:18;"be all sorts of fun stuff happening. Anyway. Why did we get on this? We're just talking"
07:18;07:22;"about TV. Well I was saying that back in the day not only would you have syndicated shows"
07:22;07:26;"where there'd be a new one on one channel and a rerun on another. There used to just"
07:26;07:30;"be that thing where you'd just be like oh it's Seinfeld it's Thursday night. And then"
07:30;07:34;"you'd just be like oh it's a rerun. You wouldn't even know ahead of time. Maybe if you've got"
07:34;07:38;"TV Guide or something. Do you remember NBC had a campaign where it was like if you haven't"
07:38;07:43;"seen it it's new for you. That's pretty cool. That's not bad."
07:43;08:00;"Here we stand. Remote control buttons in our sweaty little hands. As one man. We're lining up and waiting for someone's command."
08:09;08:34;"We don't move. We sign out for food. Get the news on video. I can't move. There's no need for movies. We got HBO and the TVA."
08:34;08:39;"I was asking about the non-cable because in Canada where I'm from if you don't have cable"
08:39;08:46;"at least back in the day it was like two channels. Only two? Yeah it was it was CBC and it was"
08:46;08:50;"global and global I remember was a little fuzzy. Really? They gave you like 80 percent"
08:50;08:55;"of global. So you're essentially living in the 40s. Pretty much. One channel. Yeah. There"
08:55;09:02;"was no BBC. No. Well there's CBC. No I know but what is Canada's relationship with the"
09:02;09:08;"UK? Well I've been to Canada twice in the last month and a half. It got me thinking"
09:08;09:12;"I was like what you know it was like the Queen Elizabeth is on the quarter. Yeah. They're"
09:12;09:18;"part of the Commonwealth. That's right. But I think it was formally severed. Yeah. At"
09:18;09:25;"some point. I'm gonna mess this up. Okay. Canada is a sovereign nation but I think the"
09:25;09:30;"breakup from England was more amicable so there's still this weird fealty to the Queen"
09:30;09:35;"and to the monarchy and the royalty so it's on the money and stuff but I don't know there"
09:35;09:40;"wasn't like a. There wasn't a Canadian armed revolution. That's right. But then in Canada"
09:40;09:46;"there is a lot of tension with the French speakers. Yeah because Quebec tried to separate"
09:46;09:51;"right in the early 90s. Oh wow. There's been violence here and there and it was very tense"
09:51;09:58;"right? To be like a like a separate sovereign nation. Yeah. Like Scotland kind of flirted"
09:58;10:02;"with that. Yeah. And obviously Northern Ireland. I actually remember being a kid and thinking"
10:02;10:08;"that separation because Quebec is like kind of not it's not on the edge of Canada and"
10:08;10:13;"I remember thinking that they were gonna like separate like literally from the country somehow"
10:13;10:17;"like with like dynamite or something. Put some dynamite on the fault lines. And just"
10:17;10:22;"like blow it out. Right because you were growing up in Montreal. That's right. Yeah. So I remember"
10:22;10:27;"being young and being like thinking it was a literal separation like a geographic separation"
10:27;10:33;"but of course not. And then they lost. Do you speak French? A very rusty. You can get"
10:33;10:40;"by in Montreal being anglophone. Anyway. Cool Canada tangent. Outside of the rerun episode"
10:40;10:44;"have the fans been feeling the banked ups? Yeah. Yeah I think they've been feeling the"
10:44;10:48;"banked ups. I glanced at the Time Crisis 2000 Twitter not too long ago and I was happy to"
10:48;10:55;"see that you'd gotten the followers up to 15k. We're actually at 16k now. Because I"
10:55;11:00;"remember forever you're just stalled at 11. Yeah I mean. Just sad. Yeah it was a little"
11:00;11:06;"sad but I think I think we're down on the way up. I like a nice round. I don't like"
11:06;11:10;"it when when it gets into the decimals. Okay so let's just keep it right at 16 for a while."
11:10;11:17;"Yeah nobody follow and no one unfollow. Yeah if you get too high just start blocking people."
11:17;11:22;"But also we could just start going we've never gone like full pluckers. No. I feel like we've"
11:22;11:27;"talked about this but I think that the issue with it right now is you're doing the vast"
11:27;11:32;"majority of the tweeting on show day. That's true. Which is every two weeks. That's true."
11:32;11:36;"So you're kind of preaching to the choir. Right. If you went full pluckers which is"
11:36;11:41;"gain followers at any cost almost to the point where you overshadow the thing that you're"
11:41;11:47;"representing. Like we don't go too hard on show days but we go you know every Tuesday"
11:47;11:51;"Wednesday Thursday we're dropping a funny meme to the point that people are like oh"
11:51;11:56;"do you fall time crisis 2000 and people be like oh yeah what is that just a meme account."
11:56;12:00;"But no actually it's an Internet radio show. Yeah I mean that would be a good strategy"
12:00;12:06;"to pander to the. I don't care anymore. I'm just glad that we didn't stall out at 11000."
12:06;12:11;"So anyway I feel like the banked episodes were good. Right. They're quality episodes."
12:11;12:15;"Yeah. We might have been too honest about them being banked. We could just record all"
12:15;12:20;"those be like hey guys welcome back. Oh it's a real scorcher. It's June. Anyway let's open"
12:20;12:25;"the mailbag you know. Would that have been smarter. Well you know it's funny because"
12:25;12:30;"I think Old Town Road was number one when we did that first bank app and it's over one."
12:30;12:34;"So you're right. We could have just kept talking about Old Town Road. Old Town Road just became"
12:34;12:39;"the longest running number one single of all time. But how do you explain that. Well part"
12:39;12:44;"of it is cooking the books. How do you mean that doesn't pass the test to me that that"
12:44;12:48;"song. Well OK. Well first of all it's a massive massive hit. I understand that. I met Lil"
12:48;12:55;"Nas X at Glastonbury briefly. Very cool. Is he a TC head. Didn't seem very familiar with"
12:55;13:01;"TC or VW. The head of Sony Music was like a little sex like you know as a vampire we"
13:01;13:05;"can. He said something like that. And we had just played and he was hanging out backstage"
13:05;13:10;"so he'd probably say he's like oh yeah I just saw you on the screen. Is he on Sony. Yeah."
13:10;13:16;"This is a big win for label me for our label Columbia. So I consider it a personal victory."
13:16;13:20;"So first of all it's a massive hit and it's his first song and it's incredible. So I'm"
13:20;13:26;"not knocking it at all. Yeah. More just as a stats geek. The question that I have is"
13:26;13:33;"when did we start counting remixes towards the song. So like I thought you have your"
13:33;13:39;"song Old Town Road then you have your Billy Ray Cyrus version then you have your Diplo"
13:39;13:44;"version you know so on so forth. I thought that you know maybe the Billy Ray Cyrus version"
13:44;13:48;"is number one for a few weeks and then it falls off. Then the BTS remix is number one."
13:48;13:52;"I think they change the rules so that all the remixes feed back into the same chart"
13:52;13:56;"position. Is that conjecture. That is what they're doing. That's my understanding. And"
13:56;14:00;"I'm just surprised that that's how the rules work. Well first of all this song was going"
14:00;14:04;"number one no matter what. It's a massive hit. Yeah. I just wonder if this is one of"
14:04;14:07;"those things where in years to come people be looking through and be like well what are"
14:07;14:10;"the longest running number one singles of all time. And there's going to be a little"
14:10;14:16;"asterisk next to this one because it was juicing. Most songs don't have five remixes. I always"
14:16;14:22;"thought that the remixes were just promotion for the flagship Old Town Road and then the"
14:22;14:27;"remixes were just a way to keep it in the news cycle. Well first of all the remixes"
14:27;14:32;"are a great idea even just for that. I can't think of another song that had this many remixes"
14:32;14:36;"where there was still kind of like excitement about it. The BTS remix is called Soul Town"
14:36;14:42;"Road. Wow. Because you know BTS moved from Idaho to Korea. Right. Right. This is like"
14:42;14:52;"the eighth iteration of BTS. This joke just never gets old. Doug's out of the band. It's"
14:52;14:56;"like he's part of the management structure. He's part of the management structure. He"
14:56;15:02;"was very early. He called up Lil Nas X and said I need Bill to spill out a remix ASAP."
15:02;15:09;"Yeah I'm gonna take my horse to the Soul Town Road I'm gonna ride till I can't no more"
15:09;15:16;"I'm gonna take my horse to the Soul Town Road I'm gonna ride till I can't no more"
15:16;15:23;"I got the horses in the bag horse stock is attached head is matted black got the boots"
15:23;15:29;"is black to match riding on a horse you can whip your Porsche I been in the valley you"
15:29;15:38;"ain't been up off that Porsche now can't nobody tell me nothing you can't tell me nothing"
15:38;15:47;"can't nobody tell me nothing you can't tell me nothing I got the homies in my bag yeah"
15:47;15:53;"have you heard of that yeah homies made the scale from Korea to the guys riding to the"
15:53;16:00;"farm riding on the car we gonna get you money with my homie in your backyard can't nobody"
16:00;16:11;"tell me nothing you can't tell me nothing can't nobody tell me nothing you can't tell"
16:11;16:19;"me nothing yeah I'm gonna take my horse to the Soul Town Road I'm gonna ride till I can't"
16:19;16:27;"no more I'm gonna take my horse to the Soul Town Road I'm gonna ride till I can't no more"
16:27;16:32;"yeah so anyway I think it's a great idea just to keep the excitement going about the song"
16:32;16:38;"but my understanding is that every iteration of the remix all feeds back into one number"
16:38;16:42;"I mean I guess it makes sense but it's not the historical precedent I mean it really"
16:42;16:46;"is like juicing it's like a little bit it makes sense that Barry Bonds hit 73 home"
16:46;16:51;"runs when he was absolutely jacked yeah but the players before him weren't operating at"
16:51;16:55;"that level so it's like that's where you know that's why there's the asterisk it's a little"
16:55;16:59;"bit like it's like a fully different strategy right and I know that one of the songs that"
16:59;17:03;"previously held the record for like longest number one was like a Mariah Carey Boys to"
17:03;17:09;"Men duet from the 90s so you know that song did not have like five remixes yeah it wasn't"
17:09;17:13;"like it just was hanging tough yeah what song was it now Scott Weiland and Storm Temple"
17:13;17:24;"Pilots Jumping On that's a cool concept what was the song Seinfeld one sweet day one sweet"
17:24;17:28;"day I'm surprised it wasn't like a Beatles song like Hey Jude or something that like"
17:28;17:34;"hung on for like yeah but think about months and months is crazy yeah back in the 60s the"
17:34;17:38;"bands would release singles like every couple months they'd be nothing stuck around that"
17:38;17:43;"long so anyway I definitely don't want to be knocking Old Town Road success I'm not"
17:43;17:48;"saying this is a moral argument this is just a true stats geek question yeah advanced metrics"
17:48;17:52;"it's a different type of metrics man also I wonder if it's you know the way things are"
17:52;17:57;"are on the internet now or it's like too big to fail at some point like the right dogs"
17:57;18:02;"take up all this bandwidth and they just hang tough and I'm sure streaming helps that yeah"
18:02;18:06;"that's one way or another yeah but I guess it's just like back in the day it's a fundamentally"
18:06;18:11;"different marketing challenge like we're all fans of marketing here oh yeah so it's kind"
18:11;18:16;"of like if somebody told you that McDonald's are bringing back the McRib and you're like"
18:16;18:20;"I want to keep the McRib popping for all three months that it's out I don't want it to be"
18:20;18:25;"this initial excitement about the McRib everybody comes and eats the McRib and then the sales"
18:25;18:30;"you know fall off the next two months I want it to stay exciting now if we're talking the"
18:30;18:35;"90s version or older then the challenge would be like all right well how do you keep getting"
18:35;18:39;"people more and more excited about the same damn thing and you would be like well okay"
18:39;18:44;"my strategy is month two we're going hard with a new advertisement we're doing a radio"
18:44;18:49;"campaign month three we're doing a contest now I think my understanding is that the 2019"
18:49;18:54;"version be like well how are you gonna keep people excited about the McRib for three months"
18:54;18:58;"let's say I got an idea first two weeks is a McRib second two weeks it's on a pretzel"
18:58;19:04;"roll and then the final week there's you know artisanal pickles on it Brooklyn McRib yeah"
19:04;19:09;"the Brooklyn artisanal pickle I would just say you know those are two different sets"
19:09;19:13;"of rules to operate with them very existential because what you're saying is once you alter"
19:13;19:19;"the core McRib is it still a McRib anymore right I'm waiting for Tom York to show up"
19:19;19:24;"on one of these remixes of Old Town Road Tom York is probably up next I guess it's also"
19:24;19:28;"like we'll probably have to wrestle I don't know why my mind went here but we'll probably"
19:28;19:34;"have to wrestle with similar issues as DNA science becomes more advanced and we have"
19:34;19:40;"clones and things like that oh wow so maybe at the Grammys for instance there will be"
19:40;19:45;"you know let's say that I decide to make five clone children of myself yeah the technology"
19:45;19:49;"is almost there I like where you're going and I say you know what man I'm busting my"
19:49;19:54;"hump out there on the road with Vampire Weekend I get home I don't even have a second to myself"
19:54;19:58;"because I got to go do my internet radio show I got to prepare for that for days I got to"
19:58;20:03;"prepare for that for days I want to go out there and do make more music but I don't have"
20:03;20:09;"time man so I clone five versions of myself and I send one to LA one to a different part"
20:09;20:14;"of LA I send one to London that's a major city you put on the west side of LA one on"
20:14;20:19;"the east side I got two in LA because it's a really big music city I guess one in New"
20:19;20:24;"York there's still some music from New York one in Atlanta and then I send one to Seoul"
20:24;20:29;"I've got all five of my clones busting their humps because I can work on Vampire Weekend"
20:29;20:32;"I have these guys producing writing songs for all sorts of people and all these guys"
20:32;20:37;"by the way their name is Ezra Koenig it's the same DNA I did not choose to give these"
20:37;20:45;"guys different names we identify as one living organism what's that from Star Trek the Borg"
20:45;20:50;"we're the Borg we identify as a Borg and don't you dare tell me that we need to identify"
20:50;20:55;"as different people because that's not how we think and then Grammy time comes and because"
20:55;21:00;"there's also a funny role with the Grammys if the only thing you produced that year is"
21:00;21:05;"your own sh*t you can't be nominated for producer of the year okay wow so you kind of need to"
21:05;21:08;"get your hands in a few different pots and I come out and I say alright guys nominate"
21:08;21:11;"me for producer of the year and they say well okay what did you produce this year and I'll"
21:11;21:17;"be like well I mean with K-pop alone I produced over 30 things in LA I was producing some"
21:17;21:22;"hipsters on the east side some Swedish people on the west side you know and then they say"
21:22;21:26;"well hold on a second this is an inhuman pace you're working at this is crazy and they say"
21:26;21:31;"no no that was five different guys and I'll say like they literally have the exact same"
21:31;21:36;"DNA and I know somebody some smart ass is gonna be like what about twins twins are something"
21:36;21:42;"that happened by chance I made this happen I mean this is making me think of this concept"
21:42;21:48;"of like a rock and roll Jurassic Park for like if you could like take Mick Jagger's"
21:48;21:55;"DNA and then like create like a young Mick Jagger or like dig up Jerry Garcia's remains"
21:55;22:01;"and like create a young Jerry Garcia and then instead of holograms it's kind of like a really"
22:01;22:07;"lame Westworld yeah it's just like all these old billionaire dudes hang out and it's like"
22:07;22:13;"and by the way fellas when you're done hunting raptors tonight come see a Jerry Garcia,"
22:13;22:20;"Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page jam together you dig up Jim Morrison and Jim Morrison on vocals"
22:20;22:24;"Jim Morrison clone age 22"
22:24;22:30;"Well I dig a little down about an hour ago"
22:30;22:35;"Took a little ride with me to Wimlow"
22:35;22:41;"With a little girl in a Hollywood bungalow"
22:41;22:46;"Are you a lucky little lady in the city of night"
22:46;22:52;"Or did you run a lost thing your own city of night"
22:52;22:55;"City of night"
22:58;23:00;"City of night"
23:00;23:06;"Just imagine like the Grammys has to start having like bylaws about genetics and like"
23:06;23:12;"defining personhood I storm out in disgust"
23:12;23:19;"Kids you have to understand back in the day there was just one copy of every person right"
23:19;23:23;"it's like you know Elton John was a genius but there was only one of them that's why"
23:23;23:30;"he only had X amount of number one hits right now we've cloned Elton John and that's why"
23:30;23:37;"he has 40 hits this year that's right and we cloned Bernie Taupin it's a little bit"
23:37;23:41;"like that last Black Mirror episode which I got to admit it was not my favorite Black"
23:41;23:45;"Mirror the one with Miley Cyrus I haven't seen it yet well whatever there's there's"
23:45;23:50;"a pop star in it she's a pop star in it and there's talk about technological ways like"
23:50;23:55;"how you could do a whole tour in one day well think about it man gotta schlep the same like"
23:55;24:01;"time travel no just oh the clones I think it was clones or something like that Wow you"
24:01;24:07;"could just have like a vampire weekend show like once a week in every city yeah just keep"
24:07;24:12;"the clones there also I could send the clones from a young age to different country so that"
24:12;24:17;"the soul based clone maybe he'd spend every summer with me and I would teach him my artistic"
24:17;24:22;"sensibility but he would be raised in Korea he'd be fluent in Korean a true nature versus"
24:22;24:28;"nurture experiment yeah I was like the idea like the picture like award shows of the future"
24:28;24:33;"that the like the Oscars has like a very traditional definition of personhood and the Golden Globes"
24:33;24:41;"is like get the more clones the better they break the seal the Golden Globes very lax"
24:41;24:48;"they drink at the Golden Globes right it's a much more lax situation just 87 year old"
24:48;24:54;"Leonardo DiCaprio gives a speech on stage about like it's not fair a Borg actor should"
24:54;25:02;"not be in the same category as a single man and just like you suck you old piece of and"
25:02;25:10;"then like the 22 year old Leo from the Titanic era comes out on stage his weird clone knifes"
25:10;25:17;"him I did not give permission to clone me I think also beyond the Borg there's definitely"
25:17;25:22;"going to be I know people are probably listening saying that the Borg idea is so crazy but"
25:22;25:27;"it doesn't sound that crazy to me well and also even beyond like the five clone idea"
25:27;25:32;"because I'm sure people would be like no you're five clones you're quintuplets or sextuplets"
25:32;25:38;"shout out to Marlon Wayans and we'll be like no we identify as you know more like a multiple"
25:38;25:43;"man from X-Men kind of situation and they might not buy it okay fine that's going to"
25:43;25:49;"be a sticky one but there's also going to be situations where once people can start"
25:49;25:53;"like uploading their consciousness to the cloud and stuff that's going to be some different"
25:53;25:57;"stuff where let's say you don't literally create clones of yourself but you're like"
25:57;26:02;"I uploaded part of my consciousness to the cloud and they just downloaded it you know"
26:02;26:08;"onto a screen in Seoul and then I'm there working with the next generation of K-pop"
26:08;26:14;"stars just anything that allows you to kind of do yes clones yeah BTS 3 and Doug Marsh's"
26:14;26:19;"clone B3s is the third generation one way or another people are going to figure out"
26:19;26:23;"ways to like split consciousness whether it's literally through having different beings"
26:23;26:27;"or something yeah where you could do two things at once and then somebody's be like well I"
26:27;26:32;"can only do one thing at once man yeah I'm heavy yeah I'm sorry my dad's not a captain"
26:32;26:38;"in the Space Force I'm sorry my dad's not Jeff Bezos fifth generation clone I don't"
26:38;26:43;"necessarily have the money to split my consciousness four ways it's going to get real sticky"
27:10;27:16;"well so anyway clearly Lil Nas X has really opened a can of worms here yeah this is the"
27:16;27:22;"moment where advanced metrics advanced metrics Lil Nas X is opening you don't want to open"
27:22;27:27;"that advanced metrics doors because you can't close it man the Pandora's box which is why"
27:27;27:34;"steroids should be legal in the MLB Juice Island here we go back to some classics here"
27:34;27:38;"wait here's a thought this sounds like an essay that somebody would have written is"
27:38;27:45;"it possible that the reason we cling so tight to these outdated ideas of what fair competition"
27:45;27:50;"is such as oh you're not allowed to use steroids in baseball is the reason that in institutions"
27:50;27:58;"like the MLB or the Oscars that doesn't allow Borgs is the reason that we have these traditionalist"
27:58;28:05;"views of what's fair because in the institutions that really matter such as the economy and"
28:05;28:12;"society and government man there really are no rules whatsoever you ever think about that"
28:12;28:16;"and this probably also why people love to you know call each other out on Twitter too"
28:16;28:20;"because it's the only place you feel like there could be some form of justice man because"
28:20;28:26;"we're all so powerless Jeff Bezos doesn't play by the rules does he hell no man according"
28:26;28:32;"to Bernie that's raw according to Bernie Amazon doesn't didn't pay a nickel one nickel it's"
28:32;28:37;"so funny that it's a nickel that's like so on brand I know because a nickel is such like"
28:37;28:44;"an old person unit I know that debate Bernie was so just in classic form I didn't watch"
28:44;28:49;"I had no interest but I watched like 20 minutes of highlights of my brother yeah yeah I watched"
28:49;28:53;"some highlights but there's even just the way that people watch it but the nickel like"
28:53;28:58;"really stuck out did not pay a nickel yeah like I wonder if there's a kid just watching"
28:58;29:04;"what's in the kids know what nickels are I'm sure Seinfeld the kids know what nickels are"
29:04;29:09;"yeah they know they know what pennies are no they don't know about pennies weirdly"
29:09;29:13;"enough yeah but anyway I think there's something to it it's like we watch with our essentially"
29:13;29:18;"this defeatist attitude everybody a defeatist attitude we're like Amazon literally doesn't"
29:18;29:23;"pay a nickel in taxes but you're telling me I can't take steroids to hit a baseball too"
29:23;29:32;"silent but this we do it was an illusion but this was an illusion it's yeah in the wake"
29:32;29:39;"of this hypocrisy juice island was formed for any any people who are listening who aren't"
29:39;29:44;"hardcore TC heads I'm amazed you made it this far in the episode but juice island was a"
29:44;29:50;"concept we cooked up that's an island where we do all the big sports competitions but"
29:50;29:54;"people are just breaking the records because we let you do whatever you want if you want"
29:54;29:58;"to destroy your body with steroids or whatever that's on you that's during the day and then"
29:58;30:06;"at night it's rock and roll yeah anyway so what else is going on how are you bud I'm"
30:06;30:11;"all right how's to her then I haven't seen you since Chicago yeah tours been great I mean"
30:11;30:15;"Chicago is definitely a high point that was great but actually since then we had a lot"
30:15;30:19;"of great shows I gotta say I think I said in the last episode like I love touring the"
30:19;30:27;"Midwest yeah that's vampire country man I mean just that run was just so good there wasn't"
30:27;30:31;"a bad show then we went to Europe and I'll admit I was a little bit hesitant about going"
30:31;30:37;"to Europe why is that because I'm all American man okay this country has a lot of problems"
30:37;30:42;"but at the end of the day vampires going heartland rock we're heartland I think I said this in"
30:42;30:46;"terms of vampire weekend in terms of our tickets is a lot less coastal elite than people might"
30:46;30:50;"think interesting there's nothing worse and I feel bad if you are the type artist but"
30:50;30:56;"you know I think I said this like show up in the US numbers looking good in New York"
30:56;31:01;"and LA but you're not worth a damn in Milwaukee right come on that's how you lose an election"
31:01;31:09;"you're playing meat and potatoes dude that's right meat and potatoes rock and roll and"
31:09;31:13;"also I've heard a lot of people I don't know this hasn't been my experience but I've heard"
31:13;31:16;"a lot of people in the music industry say to like that New York is one of the most disloyal"
31:16;31:22;"markets we're from New York fickle yeah we're from New York so maybe it's a little bit different"
31:22;31:27;"we've never like struck out in New York right but if you're like on the way down people"
31:27;31:32;"in New York are like oh I'm out I'm gonna check the new thing out yeah people have said"
31:32;31:35;"that although there's a part of me that's like are they just picturing like a Manhattan"
31:35;31:40;"night kind of like a feat like yeah just being like oh that's over yeah at the end of the"
31:40;31:45;"day New York is a big area and what there's like people from Jersey and Connecticut you"
31:45;31:50;"know and people are fans of things right but anyway it has this reputation that it's a"
31:50;31:55;"fickle market huh but look the whole world's fickle you know anyway we had a great time"
31:55;31:59;"in the Midwest and then we're going to Europe and there was a part of me that's like obviously"
31:59;32:02;"it's not cool to be American you shouldn't be proud of being American you shouldn't be"
32:02;32:07;"proud of anything in my opinion but agreed at least when we tour the US I'm in the same"
32:07;32:12;"time zone as my loved ones right I have more context for everything because you know like"
32:12;32:17;"as I get older too I'm sure we've had this discussion like you know you go to Europe"
32:17;32:21;"you go to Amsterdam for the first time you like look at the architecture and it's unbelievable"
32:21;32:25;"that in the art and there's so many amazing things but then at the end of the day like"
32:25;32:30;"if I go take a long walk in you know Milwaukee or Cleveland I just have more context for"
32:30;32:35;"it I'm a real American again not pride but just like you know it's the country that I'm"
32:35;32:39;"from and I've I can just understand things I think on a deeper level or at least I'm"
32:39;32:43;"almost more curious or something because I can find like now I'm harder on myself when"
32:43;32:48;"you're young and you I didn't leave the country until I was the first time I left was I was"
32:48;32:54;"14 and then I only once or twice until the Vampire Weekend era when we started touring"
32:54;32:58;"a lot but also find a little bit like now that I'm older when I have these thoughts"
32:58;33:04;"you know if I'm in you know like Spain and I see like a sign for a movie it says some"
33:04;33:07;"random thing that's kind of like funny then there's this other voice man it's like man"
33:07;33:11;"you don't even know what you're looking at yeah chill out man it's like when I was a"
33:11;33:16;"kid watching Saburo Higante just no idea what was happening I was trying so if you walk"
33:16;33:21;"through Milwaukee those contexts yeah this probably sounds kind of ignorant it's like"
33:21;33:24;"it almost sounds like I don't want to know because I do want to know everywhere I go"
33:24;33:28;"I'm just saying right off the bat in the US and maybe because it's kind of a crisis moment"
33:28;33:33;"in the US right that somehow almost feel like I just want to know more what's going on or"
33:33;33:37;"something vampire goes heartland you got to clean up your own backyard first"
33:38;33:40;"Red and white"
33:40;33:43;"Blue suede shoes"
33:43;33:46;"I'm Uncle Sam"
33:46;33:49;"How do you do?"
33:49;33:53;"Give me five"
33:53;33:56;"I'm still alive"
33:56;33:59;"Ain't no luck"
33:59;34:02;"I learned to duck"
34:02;34:04;"I'm still alive"
34:04;34:09;"Check my pulse"
34:09;34:12;"It don't change"
34:12;34:15;"It's day 72"
34:15;34:18;"Don't shine or rain"
34:18;34:22;"Wave the flag"
34:22;34:25;"Pop the bag"
34:25;34:28;"Park the boat"
34:28;34:31;"Skin the goat"
34:31;34:33;"Pop the bag"
34:33;34:38;"You're listening to"
34:38;34:42;"Time Crisis on Beast 1"
34:42;34:46;"So I was a little bit like oh what's this gonna be like in Europe turned out it was"
34:46;34:50;"great were you playing festivals or just like playing like a club like you play in like"
34:50;34:57;"Madrid what was the show it was a festival called mad cool festival 1 a.m. set what yeah"
34:57;35:03;"that was kind of brutal for two hours no nobody asked you to play two hours at a festival hour"
35:03;35:07;"I think 75 holy and I mean it was a great crowd and was a beautiful night it was just"
35:07;35:12;"brutal for me because I was really tired so yeah it was mostly festivals that's wild but"
35:12;35:17;"we did two club shows one was in Zurich and one was in Milan and also had really low expectations"
35:17;35:22;"for those two because we hadn't played a proper show in Italy in 10 years but we just didn't"
35:22;35:29;"go there yeah and then in Zurich we hadn't played a show in Zurich since 2008 11 years"
35:29;35:33;"so I was a little bit like is this gonna be like a bummer you know we just had this like"
35:33;35:38;"great time in the Midwest is this gonna feel like wow we're really this is not not our audience"
35:38;35:41;"not our audience yeah and then actually it was cool because like the people who were"
35:41;35:46;"there were like there was really like a sense of like we've been waiting so we like played"
35:46;35:50;"real long shows and it was a great vibe oh we also did a headline show in Dublin Wow"
35:50;35:56;"and when we played Jerusalem New York Berlin the crowd sang Jerusalem New York Dublin but"
35:56;35:59;"no it's actually that tour was pretty tight we played Poland for the first time that was"
35:59;36:06;"a great crowd at a festival we played Rasgulda in Denmark before Wu-Tang Clan that was great"
36:06;36:10;"yeah actually it was all good did you get to link and build with the Wu-Tang Clan was"
36:10;36:16;"there any interaction backstage with you know that RZA was in the giving up the gun music"
36:16;36:21;"video oh that's right I haven't spoken to him since then but we were actually backstage"
36:21;36:25;"at catering and we were all sitting down and then we see like you know 40 feet away there's"
36:25;36:30;"a long table with all of Wu-Tang Clan Method Man was not on the tour though I don't know"
36:30;36:34;"why but Method Man was not there and so I was looking over and we were all like pretty"
36:34;36:39;"excited to see Wu-Tang and I was thinking to myself okay it wouldn't be crazy to say"
36:39;36:44;"what's up to RZA he was in our video and he was cool so I said you know what if I find"
36:44;36:50;"myself within five feet of RZA I'll say hi to him didn't happen I was about 30 feet away"
36:50;36:54;"from him at one point but I'm not gonna beeline it over to him you know yeah I don't want"
36:54;36:58;"to force it because what do you say after that really you go hey we're you're in my"
36:58;37:03;"video right I could see the conversation yeah yeah yeah right I remember that yeah well"
37:03;37:07;"how's it going yeah thanks again man that was great having you in there yo my yo for"
37:07;37:12;"real my pleasure you mean this Trump stuff I'm just too tristate you know what I probably"
37:12;37:16;"could have said to him I probably could have said like yeah just like thank you for being"
37:16;37:21;"in the video absolutely be like um you're from the tri-state area right Staten Island"
37:21;37:25;"what and then I know I read his book I'm a fan he then he lived in New Jersey for a long"
37:25;37:30;"time I also was born in New York and then lived in New Jersey oh for real yeah remember"
37:30;37:36;"when WPIX show movies at eight I bet he would remember that what do you think about Connecticut"
37:36;37:40;"throwing the tri-state area well you know there's it's not a RZA song but there's a"
37:40;37:46;"famous Wu-Tang song that says Connecticut have we ever talked about this no news to"
37:46;37:50;"me are you talking about incarcerated Scarfaces yeah that's right Raekwon"
37:51;37:56;"time is running out it's for real though let's connect politics ditto we can trade places"
37:56;38:01;"we can lift it in the circus word up he's incarcerated Scarface related style attract"
38:01;38:06;"millions fans they understand my plan who's the kid up in the green land me and the RZA"
38:06;38:11;"connect blow a fuse you lose half ass fools get demolished and bruised fakely frontin"
38:11;38:16;"hourglass heads you can be wantin shuttin now your slot time for plumpin poisonous sting"
38:16;38:21;"which dumps up in that trunk space a heavy generator but yo guess who's the black trump"
38:21;38:26;"well I Trump here we go I didn't remember there's a Trump line peace the power in my"
38:26;38:33;"own unit word up quick to set it don't wet it real quick shots peace Connecticut well"
38:33;38:38;"we can't say it something take shots peace Connecticut actually Seinfeld so they're leaving"
38:38;38:43;"Connecticut yeah unless they're saying like peace to Connecticut like Seinfeld open get"
38:43;38:48;"open this up in genius because I remember even being a kid and hearing this piece Connecticut"
38:48;38:54;"just like wait what's up with Connecticut yeah so Raekwon was interviewed about this"
38:54;39:02;"and he said the sound of the Hartford Sentinel where was the song is definitely people's"
39:02;39:08;"favorite record especially when I go to Connecticut I call it the Connecticut anthem whoa it's"
39:08;39:11;"just like you never heard about this Jake all those years in Connecticut I'm out of"
39:11;39:17;"the loop on this one you were listening to too much BTS back in this era does he say"
39:17;39:21;"what it meant so he doesn't actually he talks about the impact of that line but he doesn't"
39:21;39:28;"really talk about why he said it I guess just a random shout out to a tri-state neighbor"
39:28;39:32;"neighbor yeah he says he's Connecticut it's like I put the whole state in my pocket when"
39:32;39:38;"I did that very savvy I guess kid underserved market doesn't get a lot of love in rap so"
39:38;39:43;"for Raekwon to do that I think I can't tell if he's giving it love but I'll take him at"
39:43;39:50;"his word to shout out speaking of a geographic reference to get the crowd going I mean I've"
39:50;39:55;"thought about this before because Vampire Weekend has all sorts of geographic references and"
39:55;39:59;"they're all generally positive but one of the shows we have coming up this year is in"
39:59;40:05;"Norfolk Virginia and you know so far even with Vampire Weekend strong commitment to switching"
40:05;40:12;"up the set list and stuff I've been very hesitant I think we all have about doing the kind of"
40:12;40:17;"suck up stuff so we've been dropping a lot of covers you know mixing it up here and there"
40:17;40:24;"yeah but so for instance as any VW head knows we have a very faithful cover of the boys"
40:24;40:29;"are back in town love it so you can imagine in Dublin oh that went off well no no no did"
40:29;40:33;"you do it no we didn't do it okay yeah because it would feel like it was pain we talked about"
40:33;40:37;"it we thought that would be too much of a suck up move come on do cowboy song okay or"
40:37;40:41;"just do like a random other cover don't dream it's I tell you we've been dropping don't"
40:41;40:45;"dream it's over oh really I think we've done it like four or five times I'm psyched to"
40:45;40:52;"hear that hey now hey now don't dream it's over it went down really well and then we"
40:52;40:56;"walked off stage and I think I was talking to Bayo and he was like man that felt really"
40:56;40:59;"good like people were into that and Bayo was like well this is the first time we've covered"
40:59;41:05;"a hit hmm we've been dropping like Joker man all the time right nine minute Joker man people"
41:05;41:11;"are like what is this we closed out our set at a festival in the Netherlands with a 10"
41:11;41:16;"minute Joker man that's so legit that was a Bayo call he's been making a lot of good"
41:16;41:20;"calls with the setlist because he closing with Joker man because he did some research"
41:20;41:24;"and he was like look we play different festivals there's some where you just want to bring"
41:24;41:29;"in nothing but hits and then he was like listen this festival is a little funkier like right"
41:29;41:36;"after us Tom York plays are you serious yeah so 10 minute Joker man into well Tom York"
41:36;41:40;"solo set well he was on a different stage but it's like a funkier like the headliner"
41:40;41:44;"was underworld he's kind of like dance I mean I wouldn't maybe they're not particularly"
41:44;41:49;"left of center but they're cool like it's an alternative so yeah like on the bill that"
41:49;41:54;"day was like Kamasi Washington Tom York gotcha and then underworld so I think Bayo had the"
41:54;41:59;"sense of like you know Glastonbury we played after Miley Cyrus so the hits just come oh"
41:59;42:03;"and she was just nailing hits yeah yeah although we took some chances at Glastonbury we closed"
42:03;42:09;"with a Jerusalem New York Berlin thought that was bold strong choice but anyway normally"
42:09;42:13;"dropping the 10 minute Joker man at festivals is it feels very hit or miss we did it twice"
42:13;42:18;"we did it at down the rabbit hole which people get in they always get in by the end yeah"
42:18;42:24;"the first five minutes I sometimes look out I don't even want to look out yeah like are"
42:24;42:29;"you into this we also dropped Joker man in our festival set in Portugal Wow we've never"
42:29;42:33;"done a festival where we lost too many people except actually we did a festival in Korea"
42:33;42:38;"once where we played Hannah Hunt and this is in the early days of men VOTC it's before"
42:38;42:42;"Hannah Hunt was considered like a fan favorite and we definitely lost a significant percentage"
42:42;42:47;"of the crowd playing Hannah like they pieced out yeah they just were like on their phones"
42:47;42:53;"no no like they pieced out I think oh I think they're like I think they're minor key one"
42:53;42:56;"I'm leaving yeah maybe we'd already played a punk or something I'd like to think if we"
42:56;42:59;"went back we'd get a better reception"
42:59;43:07;"A gardener told me some plants move but I could not believe it"
43:11;43:18;"Me and Hannah Hunt saw crawling vines and weeping willows"
43:18;43:25;"As we made our way from Providence to Phoenix"
43:25;43:37;"A man of faith said hidden eyes could see what I was thinking"
43:38;43:48;"I just smiled and told him that was only true of Hannah"
43:48;43:55;"And we glided on through Waverly to Lincoln"
43:58;44:03;"While days were long our nights no longer"
44:03;44:08;"Count the seconds watching hours"
44:08;44:13;"Though we live on the US dollar"
44:13;44:19;"You and me we got our own sense of time"
44:26;44:35;"In Santa Barbara Hannah cried amidst those freezing beaches"
44:35;44:46;"I walked into town to buy some kindling for the fire"
44:46;44:53;"Hannah told the New York Times I've been to be sent"
44:54;45:01;"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah"
45:01;45:06;"There's no future there's no answer"
45:06;45:10;"Though we live on the US dollar"
45:10;45:16;"You and me we got our own sense of time"
45:16;45:22;"[piano]"
45:22;45:40;"[piano]"
45:40;45:45;"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah"
45:45;45:50;"There's no future there's no answer"
45:50;45:54;"Though we live on the US dollar"
45:54;46:00;"You and me we got our own sense of time"
46:00;46:04;"[piano]"
46:04;46:09;"Oh but anyway so I was thinking about how you know VW generally speaking"
46:09;46:12;"You know we're not gonna drop boys are back in town in Dublin"
46:12;46:17;"Right because I feel like the Dublin fans they probably get that all the time"
46:17;46:21;"And there's probably somebody who's at the show listening just like that would rule you're a moron"
46:21;46:25;"But who knows it could have ruled yeah, but it felt like a little like low-hanging"
46:25;46:34;"I I see what you're saying I like you're saying that's a song we bust out like we played it at our really small post Lollapalooza Chicago show"
46:34;46:40;"That was no phones you know for like a thousand people that was a good vibe because I was like something special"
46:40;46:47;"You played it at Webster Hall we played at Webster Hall and that was a special show and we played it at Fuji Rock in Japan with Danielle"
46:47;46:53;"Kind of random but cool anyway so that brings me back to Norfolk Virginia because Jake has a dead head"
46:53;47:00;"Oh yep when you hear Norfolk Virginia, what's the first song you think of left my home in Norfolk Virginia"
47:00;47:06;"Can't phone you on so if people don't know this song it's a originally by Chuck Berry"
47:06;47:13;"And then the Grateful Dead just covered it constantly oh yeah and Richard pictures so you guys have done it a lot"
47:13;47:21;"We're doing it this summer people out there who maybe bought our shirt notice in the back it said the Promised Land tour you called the tour the Promised Land tour"
47:21;47:34;"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia California on my mind I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh and on across Carolina"
47:34;47:42;"I wish I got a dead version what year is this 77 okay Palladium New York"
47:42;47:57;"Left my home in Norfolk Virginia California on my mind I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh and on across Carolina"
47:57;48:03;"You know it's across my mind like oh Norfolk Virginia like Promised Land and then I thought for a second"
48:03;48:11;"Too basic and also look I bet you kick into this left my home in Norfolk Virginia you're gonna get a few cheers a la Peace Connecticut"
48:11;48:17;"Yeah when you're doing a Connecticut Raekwon show yeah but then I thought I was like what's this song about man"
48:17;48:26;"This song's about leaving Norfolk Virginia to go to California you can tell me you're gonna get a whole Los Angeles based band"
48:26;48:37;"Rolling up to Norfolk Virginia for the first time and we're gonna think we're so clever to bust out a song about leaving Norfolk Virginia for the state that we're incorporated in"
48:37;48:43;"That's how you lose an election that's how you lose an election folks that's rough that's rough stuff"
48:43;48:53;"Rough stuff the first thought that I had was what if I painstakingly rewrote the lyrics about leaving California to come back to Norfolk Virginia"
48:53;49:01;"I left my home in it's gotta be a one-suh left my home in Weed California Norfolk Virginia on my mind"
49:01;49:09;"Weed I left my home in Old California I had Norfolk on my mind"
49:09;49:18;"Straddled that greyhound rode it into Phoenix on the cross of Albuquerque line yeah I don't know Santa Fe line"
49:18;49:23;"So anyway I thought about that and then I was like hmm maybe no covers in Norfolk"
49:23;49:29;"Or the other thing that crossed my mind just like bust out a different Chuck Berry song but then I'm like this is getting convoluted"
49:29;49:33;"Yeah that's it was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished him"
49:33;49:35;"What is this guy Pulp Fiction fan?"
49:35;49:41;"Yeah I kind of want to look up what artists have busted out Promised Land and Norfolk Virginia"
49:41;49:44;"That's not an easy thing to search Seinfeld can you think of an easy way to search that?"
49:44;49:49;"I'm going to crunch on that my question was you got some big shows coming up"
49:49;49:55;"Yeah you got MSG in September and you got the Hollywood Bowl with Richard Pictures in October"
49:55;50:00;"October 2nd any covers in the mix for October you're not thinking that far ahead"
50:00;50:03;"Do an Eagle song dude"
50:03;50:08;"We could work out something new I mean you know we busted out One Piece Frog so far"
50:08;50:12;"Oh dude I saw that you saw it I saw that somehow that crossed my transom"
50:12;50:16;"It was a great version I was very happy to note for note"
50:16;50:22;"It was very faithful we didn't have a lot of time to work on it in soundcheck because there was a storm coming"
50:22;50:26;"It rained like super hard right in between soundcheck and the show"
50:26;50:33;"That was in Charlotte North Carolina I was very happy that I saw on Instagram just like some person who's at the show"
50:33;50:36;"You know they posted their pictures that they took and did a little write up and they're just like"
50:36;50:39;"Gotta say set highlight for me Peace Rock cover"
50:39;50:43;"Yeah I mean I saw like a full video of it I don't know where"
50:43;50:44;"You mean like somebody had the whole video"
50:44;50:48;"Yeah it was on I think I sent it to the Time Crisis text thread even"
50:48;50:52;"Really? Yeah and like someone had like put the whole version up and I was like damn"
50:52;50:56;"I think that James Taylor may have covered it"
50:56;51:00;"In Norfolk? I believe so but this is a tough crunch"
51:00;51:02;"I'm not gonna lie"
51:02;51:03;"I'm gonna look too I'm gonna look too"
51:03;51:04;"That's so weak"
51:04;51:05;"That James Taylor cover"
51:05;51:07;"Like a James Taylor show in Norfolk"
51:07;51:09;"I left my"
51:09;51:10;"Oh my god"
51:10;51:11;"I left"
51:11;51:12;"I mean James Taylor's cool"
51:12;51:14;"He's one of my least favorite singers"
51:14;51:15;"I cannot stand him"
51:15;51:16;"Really?"
51:16;51:18;"Super out with JT"
51:18;51:21;"I prefer Justin Timberlake to James Taylor"
51:21;51:23;"If you're talking JTs"
51:23;51:25;"Well I think come on most people do"
51:25;51:26;"Mmm"
51:26;51:31;"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia"
51:31;51:34;"The Grateful Dead performed Promised Land 428 times"
51:34;51:35;"Wow"
51:35;51:36;"That's a lot"
51:36;51:38;"Well James Taylor played it 53 times"
51:38;51:42;"So he probably wasn't dropping it just because he was in Norfolk Virginia"
51:42;51:45;"We gotta look for the people who only played it like a handful of times"
51:45;51:49;"Maybe most people were thoughtful enough not to cover it in Norfolk Virginia"
51:49;51:52;"Left my home in Norfolk Virginia"
51:52;51:56;"California on my mind"
51:56;52:03;"Stood all that greyhound and rode it into Raleigh and on across Carolina"
52:03;52:07;"Stopped in Charlotte but we bypassed Rock Hill"
52:07;52:10;"We never were a minute late"
52:10;52:15;"He was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown"
52:15;52:18;"Rolling out of Georgia State"
52:18;52:22;"Had some motor trouble and turned into a struggle"
52:22;52:25;"Halfway across Alabama"
52:25;52:29;"That hound broke down and left us all"
52:29;52:33;"Stended in downtown Birmingham"
52:33;52:36;"So he right away abode me a blue train"
52:36;52:40;"Take it right across Mississippi Clean"
52:40;52:45;"And I was on that special flyer out of Birmingham"
52:45;52:48;"Smoking indianuoli"
52:48;52:52;"Well I recently sent a video to the thread"
52:52;52:57;"So there are these great videos on YouTube called Anatomy of a Jam"
52:57;53:00;"And they're made by a guy who's a guitar, he's a musician"
53:00;53:03;"And I guess also kind of in a way a music historian"
53:03;53:06;"His name's Amar Sastry"
53:06;53:09;"It's a little bit like a podcast but it's more like a video essay"
53:09;53:12;"And so this dude's like a super hardcore fish head"
53:12;53:16;"And he'll choose certain iconic fish jams"
53:16;53:18;"And he'll break them down"
53:18;53:21;"And I sent this one to the thread and I'll say the same thing I said to the thread"
53:21;53:24;"I was like, if you're not that interested in the jam part"
53:24;53:27;"You're gonna love the first ten minutes and then you're gonna get lost for the last twenty"
53:27;53:28;"It got very technical"
53:28;53:29;"They're all about thirty minutes"
53:29;53:30;"Over my head"
53:30;53:33;"Yeah, the first ten minutes, the guy who makes it"
53:33;53:36;"He'll really get into the backstory of the song they were doing"
53:36;53:39;"Like the history of the song, did Fish write it, is it a cover, did somebody else write it"
53:39;53:44;"What's the song about, you know, how did it come to Fish, when did they start playing it"
53:44;53:46;"And that stuff's very interesting"
53:46;53:48;"And then he'll get into the actual jam stuff"
53:48;53:50;"And then you really have to be like interested"
53:50;53:51;"Music theory guy"
53:51;53:52;"Yeah, but I mean I kind of love it"
53:52;53:54;"They're really like well made"
53:54;53:55;"Yeah"
53:55;53:57;"But anyways, one of the big ones that he has up"
53:57;53:58;"And I recommend people watch it"
53:58;54:02;"Is about Fish's, a legendary performance that Fish did"
54:02;54:04;"Of the Ween song, Roses Are Free"
54:04;54:09;"And the one he's talking about was performed on April 3rd, 1998"
54:09;54:11;"And it's a twenty-seven minute version"
54:11;54:13;"And you know, so I'm like, alright cool, Fish covered Ween"
54:13;54:16;"They're like birds of a feather, also Fish song"
54:16;54:17;"Well I didn't really know the backstory"
54:17;54:18;"Not really"
54:18;54:19;"And this dude got into it"
54:19;54:21;"Not a lot of crossover"
54:21;54:25;"So basically, to summarize the video and the backstory"
54:25;54:30;"Fish started playing the Ween song, Roses Are Free, in '97"
54:30;54:33;"And you'd think that, you know, Fish at the time, the big band"
54:33;54:35;"You know, Ween would be psyched about it"
54:35;54:38;"No, in fact Ween was so pissed"
54:38;54:41;"That they stopped playing the song out of disgust"
54:41;54:43;"This is the original Ween version, Roses Are Free"
54:43;54:47;"Of the Chocolate and Cheese album"
54:48;54:49;"You're a Ween fan"
54:49;54:50;"Oh, big time"
54:50;54:51;"You like this song?"
54:51;54:52;"Oh, I love it"
54:52;54:56;"Were you aware that Fish was covering it in the '90s?"
54:56;54:58;"Um, at some point"
54:58;55:01;"I mean, I never liked Fish, still don't"
55:01;55:04;"But I do remember hearing about that, maybe like late '90s"
55:04;55:06;"That Fish was covering it"
55:06;55:10;"And yeah, it was definitely like a novel surprise to hear that"
55:16;55:19;"There's a lot of crossover in terms of like, vibe"
55:19;55:22;"Yeah, I can see it more now"
55:22;55:26;"This is a live version, not the 27-minute one"
55:26;55:39;"I mean, Ween and Fish just feel like opposite sides of the same coin"
55:39;55:42;"Narcissism, small difference, man"
55:42;55:43;"Opposite sides, yeah"
55:43;55:47;"I mean, one is, I would think Fish has an earnest approach"
55:47;55:49;"And Ween has an ironic approach"
55:49;55:51;"Yeah, Ween's post-modern and punk"
55:51;55:53;"Just imagine it's '97"
55:53;55:57;"And you're explaining the situation to OK Computer era Tom York"
55:57;56:01;"Just like, are you aware of the two American bands Ween and Fish?"
56:01;56:03;"And be like, yeah, a little bit"
56:03;56:04;"And just be like"
56:04;56:05;"I hate them both"
56:05;56:06;"Yeah, exactly"
56:06;56:09;"He just like, wouldn't get it"
56:09;56:10;"Because he'd be like"
56:10;56:13;"I mean, I feel like York would probably be more down with Fish"
56:13;56:15;"I don't feel that"
56:15;56:18;"Because the early Ween stuff was like, hella lo-fi"
56:18;56:21;"Like, deliberately anti-social"
56:21;56:22;"And abstract"
56:22;56:24;"Which is much more the Tom York vibe"
56:24;56:27;"I'm just saying that, and I like Ween and Fish"
56:27;56:29;"They're both bands with a sense of humor"
56:29;56:30;"And like, a lightness"
56:30;56:32;"They're both very musical"
56:32;56:34;"Like, they're both shredder music"
56:34;56:35;"They both have chops"
56:35;56:39;"But it's like, you know, compared to like, Radiohead is self-serious"
56:39;56:40;"Yeah"
56:40;56:42;"Which, probably for the best"
56:42;56:45;"We don't necessarily want a chocolate and cheese from Radiohead"
56:45;56:48;"But I'm just saying, like, I'm just picturing him"
56:48;56:50;"Like, you play him the Ween ""Roses Are Free"""
56:50;56:52;"And then you play him like, the Fish version"
56:52;56:55;"And you're just like, so you can imagine when Ween heard about this"
56:55;56:57;"He would just be like, the first song's a joke"
56:57;56:59;"And these guys did a joke cover of it"
56:59;57:00;"What's the problem?"
57:00;57:01;"It's a problem"
57:01;57:03;"A bunch of comedians fighting with each other"
57:03;57:04;"I'm a real artist"
57:04;57:08;"Or maybe we're being too hard on it"
57:08;57:09;"Tom Yorke would have been like"
57:09;57:11;"Well, I see where Ween's coming from"
57:11;57:12;"As a Ween mega-fan"
57:12;57:13;"I can imagine"
57:13;57:14;"I don't know"
57:14;57:15;"I just feel like Tom Yorke would be like"
57:15;57:18;"It's all some weird-ass American s*** that I don't understand"
57:18;57:21;"I bet you Ween thought that Fish were a bunch of dorks"
57:21;57:22;"I know, but"
57:22;57:24;"And it's not necessarily justified"
57:24;57:25;"But Ween are dorks"
57:25;57:26;"Are Ween not dorks?"
57:26;57:30;"I think Ween is like, or was back 20 years ago"
57:30;57:33;"Was like, self-aware"
57:33;57:34;"Kind of what Nick was saying"
57:34;57:36;"Just like, ironic"
57:36;57:37;"Detached"
57:37;57:38;"I know, but Fish is self-aware"
57:38;57:40;"I don't know if they are"
57:40;57:41;"Oh, come on"
57:41;57:42;"Define self-aware"
57:42;57:45;"I guess self-aware starts to become a slippery term"
57:45;57:47;"Everything that I've ever seen, every interview"
57:47;57:49;"Including in the 90s"
57:49;57:52;"It's like, when they would do kind of fun stuff"
57:52;57:54;"They'd know they were having fun, you know?"
57:54;57:55;"Yeah, no, you're right"
57:55;58:00;"I mean, I could see Ween and Fish both being really into Zappa"
58:00;58:02;"I think the similarity that I see"
58:02;58:04;"Is that they're both artists who you'd probably be like"
58:04;58:06;"Do you take music seriously?"
58:06;58:07;"And they'd be like, dude, are you kidding?"
58:07;58:08;"I'm like a huge music nerd"
58:08;58:10;"I listen to music non-stop"
58:10;58:12;"Can't you see how much I practice?"
58:12;58:13;"I'm like a f***ing shredder"
58:13;58:14;"And you'd be like, yeah, of course"
58:14;58:15;"And it's like, and yet"
58:15;58:18;"The music you make has a sense of humor at times"
58:18;58:20;"Yeah, they both do"
58:20;58:22;"Rather than say who has more of a sense of humor"
58:22;58:24;"I would say that Fish has a little more heart"
58:24;58:26;"Is that fair to say?"
58:26;58:28;"Okay, yeah, now I agree with that"
58:28;58:30;"This is going to be very triggering for Jake"
58:30;58:32;"This is very triggering for Jake"
58:32;58:34;"No, it's not triggering, I just like"
58:34;58:36;"I always associated Fish and Ween"
58:36;58:38;"Just because I knew a lot of people who listened to both"
58:38;58:39;"Right, right, right"
58:39;58:41;"Growing up in the tri-state area"
58:41;58:43;"That's a very tri-state area kind of Jersey"
58:43;58:44;"Oh, big time"
58:44;58:48;"Connecticut dude would easily like Fish and Ween"
58:48;58:49;"Wishing for a fiend"
58:49;58:50;"We should"
58:50;58:52;"Remember on that episode we were talking about"
58:52;58:55;"Like the multi-hyphenate cover bands"
58:55;58:58;"Like Pink Talking Fish who covers Pink Floyd"
58:58;58:59;"Oh, that'd be a sick band"
58:59;59:01;"We should just start one called Wish"
59:01;59:03;"They just do Ween and Fish covers?"
59:03;59:06;"I mean, it kind of harkens back to like"
59:06;59:10;"In the 90s, there was those much more intense divides"
59:10;59:12;"I remember in the 90s I was really into Pavement"
59:12;59:14;"And all those kind of cool indie bands"
59:14;59:16;"But I loved the Dead still"
59:16;59:18;"And that seemed very incongruous and confusing"
59:18;59:20;"To a lot of my friends"
59:20;59:23;"So I could see in this similar way"
59:23;59:26;"The guys in Ween and within the Ween community"
59:26;59:29;"Initially being very turned off by like"
59:29;59:32;"What they saw as an earnest hippie"
59:32;59:34;"Right, and they're probably also somewhat young"
59:34;59:37;"So maybe they felt the need to like really assert their taste"
59:37;59:38;"Right"
59:38;59:40;"And sometimes when you're young that means being a dick"
59:40;59:41;"Let's get into it"
59:41;59:44;"So Fish starts covering Roses Are Free"
59:44;59:46;"'97, Ween stopped playing the song out of disgust"
59:46;59:49;"In an interview, Gene Ween calls Fish boring"
59:49;59:51;"And Dean Ween complains about stinky hippies"
59:51;59:55;"Coming to their shows as a result of Fish covering them"
59:55;59:59;"Yeah, sorry we made you guys an extra 800 bucks"
59:59;01:00:01;"At your Norfolk, Virginia show"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Dicks"
01:00:03;01:00:06;"Fish continues to cover Roses Are Free"
01:00:06;01:00:08;"I love that Fish like doubled down"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"They probably like caught Ween"
01:00:10;01:00:13;"Was like kind of like thumbing their nose at them"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"And they're like let's just keep doing it"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"And this is where my question arises"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"'Cause in the anatomy of a jam"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"There's a lot of information but I don't know if"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"Amar who makes the video has the answer to this"
01:00:24;01:00:26;"He basically says Fish should start covering it"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"Ween's like we hate them"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"We're not doing it"
01:00:30;01:00:33;"You gotta assume that Fish would hear about this"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"Word would get back"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Word would get back, I mean it's pre-internet"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"It might not have been, you know, two minutes later"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"Like it would be today"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"But yeah, let's say within a few weeks"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"And anyway, Fish continues to cover it"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"Most notably in this 27 minute version"
01:00:48;01:00:49;"That we're talking about"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"April 3rd, '98"
01:00:51;01:00:54;"Widely considered one of Fish's best improvisations"
01:00:54;01:00:56;"And then sometime after that Ween begins playing the song again"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"'99 in an effort to reclaim it"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"So I guess my question is"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And you know, I'm sure maybe this is something"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"We'll do an investigative journalist"
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Journalism episode where we'll actually"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Hit up some of the dudes in Fish"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Who me and CT met in St. Louis"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"Shout out to them"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Or maybe Ween"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"I'll hit up Fish, you hit up Ween"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"I actually interviewed Gene Ween in 1996"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"For college radio"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Really?"
01:01:18;01:01:19;"And he was a huge dick"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"Wow, and you're still riding for this guy?"
01:01:21;01:01:22;"I was bummed"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"Wow"
01:01:23;01:01:24;"I love Ween"
01:01:24;01:01:25;"You're like a Trump voter"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"This guy blatantly disrespects you"
01:01:27;01:01:28;"At every turn"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"And you're just like"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"Sir, it is an honor"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"I'm just doubling down"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"I'm the biggest Ween fan"
01:01:34;01:01:36;"You know"
01:01:36;01:01:37;"Look at these"
01:01:37;01:01:38;"If we get one of those guys on the horn"
01:01:38;01:01:39;"Yeah, you're gonna bring it up"
01:01:39;01:01:40;"We're all a little bit older"
01:01:40;01:01:41;"No, I'm not gonna bring it up"
01:01:41;01:01:42;"You gotta bring it up"
01:01:42;01:01:44;"I was a very nervous"
01:01:44;01:01:46;"19 year old college student"
01:01:46;01:01:47;"Yeah"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"Quote unquote interviewing Gene"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"Hi Gene"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"Yeah, just"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"You know, in their back"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Like, you know, in their green room"
01:01:55;01:01:56;"Yeah"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"Just like, why was I there?"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"I had no good questions"
01:01:58;01:01:59;"I was just like"
01:01:59;01:02:00;"Yeah"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"He didn't have to be a dick"
01:02:01;01:02:02;"But like, you know"
01:02:02;01:02:03;"Water under the bridge"
01:02:03;01:02:04;"We're all a little bit older now"
01:02:04;01:02:05;"Anyway"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"In recent years"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Ween's feeling on Phish"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"Seemed to have changed"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"With Gene saying"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Phish, by covering it"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"Made it one of our popular"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"And most crowd pleasing tunes"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"Oh my god"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"For that we owe Trey forever"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"Because it opened up so many people's ears"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"To the music of Ween"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"And introduced us to a whole new audience"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"Within the jam band scene"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Which never would have happened otherwise"
01:02:23;01:02:24;"Then in 2016"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"Both bands headlined the Lock-In Festival"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"Jam band festival"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"Ween headlines Thursday"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"And then opens for Phish on Friday"
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Dean Ween says"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"I'd be lying if I said that opening for Phish"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Wasn't a big deal"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"All say is that we really wanted to play our asses off"
01:02:36;01:02:37;"In front of those guys"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Who were friendly with going back a long ways"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"Call it friendly competition"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"But Dean still hates Ween/Phish fans"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"And states that he wants their set"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"To harsh their vibe"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"Okay, so it sounds like"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"Okay"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"My impression"
01:02:48;01:02:49;"Because I was reading about that show"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"It seems like they didn't have a great time"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"Playing before Phish"
01:02:52;01:02:53;"And they were a little bit like"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"We headlined last night"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Now we gotta play before Phish"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"But they weren't actually dissing Phish"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"They accepted that Phish are their friends now"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"And they were more like"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"We just don't like playing in front of a Phish audience"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"So whatever"
01:03:04;01:03:05;"They're still a little prickly about that"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Oh yeah"
01:03:06;01:03:07;"So like you were wondering"
01:03:07;01:03:08;"I was wondering"
01:03:08;01:03:09;"20 years ago"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"When Phish"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"Or maybe it's just Trey himself"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"When Trey decides to keep the jam going"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"Are they flexing?"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Was it a flex on Ween?"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"Was he like"
01:03:16;01:03:17;"You know what guys"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"I hear you saying that you don't like Phish"
01:03:19;01:03:20;"And you don't like us covering your song"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Well here's a 27 minute version for your ass"
01:03:22;01:03:23;"That's pretty sick"
01:03:23;01:03:24;"You gotta give it up"
01:03:24;01:03:25;"That's tight"
01:03:25;01:03:26;"That's so sick"
01:03:26;01:03:27;"When we got back to the Ween camp"
01:03:27;01:03:30;"Yo Phish just dropped a 27 minute version of ""Rose of Freedom"""
01:03:30;01:03:32;"I was like what?"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Yeah"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"That is so sick"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"And also you gotta say"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"That's being"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"It's an outdated phrase"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"But that's being the bigger man"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"The bigger man"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"Well and also just like"
01:03:40;01:03:41;"Smash cut 20 years forward"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"Like"
01:03:42;01:03:44;"It's all water under the bridge"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Right"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"And like they're playing a show together"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"It's just like so classic"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"But the thing that I'm fascinated about"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Is that there's so many holes in this story"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Also was it truly a game time decision?"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Cause actually"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"Talking to the Phish guys a little bit"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"Backstage"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"Cause you know you always wonder"
01:03:58;01:03:59;"With bands who like"
01:03:59;01:04:00;"Truly"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"Where the set lists are just like"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"Insanely different every night"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Yeah"
01:04:03;01:04:04;"You wonder to what extent"
01:04:04;01:04:05;"That's like off the cusp"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"And just talking to them"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"Cause we"
01:04:07;01:04:08;"You know"
01:04:08;01:04:09;"We were hanging out with them like"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Three hours before"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"We were both playing in St. Louis"
01:04:12;01:04:13;"Wow"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"And so me and CT went over"
01:04:14;01:04:15;"Wow"
01:04:15;01:04:16;"And we were like asking them like"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"What's up with the set list?"
01:04:17;01:04:18;"And they're just like showing us"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"How they kinda narrow it down"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"And they're like"
01:04:21;01:04:22;"We're planning to narrow it down"
01:04:22;01:04:23;"In the morning"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"And I don't know"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"They have a whole system"
01:04:25;01:04:26;"But basically"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"Even three hours before"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"They don't know exactly"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"What they're gonna do"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"And they"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"You know"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"They'll famously bust out"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"Every show"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"They'll bust out at least"
01:04:34;01:04:35;"A handful of songs"
01:04:35;01:04:36;"That haven't been played"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"In months or years"
01:04:37;01:04:38;"And they just kinda roll with it"
01:04:38;01:04:39;"So anyway"
01:04:39;01:04:40;"My question is"
01:04:40;01:04:41;"Were there some tour bus conversation"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"Where they're just like"
01:04:42;01:04:43;"Guys"
01:04:43;01:04:44;"How do we respond to this"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"Weaning aggression?"
01:04:45;01:04:46;"And like maybe one dude's like"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"Let's stop playing this song man"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"We've provoked these guys enough"
01:04:49;01:04:50;"They don't f*** with us"
01:04:50;01:04:51;"Alright whatever"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"Why should we be"
01:04:52;01:04:53;"You know"
01:04:53;01:04:54;"Getting their paper higher"
01:04:54;01:04:55;"And then Trey's like"
01:04:55;01:04:56;"I don't wanna take it out of the set"
01:04:56;01:04:57;"Or you know"
01:04:57;01:04:58;"Was there a discussion?"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"And then"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"Was there perhaps even more discussion"
01:05:00;01:05:01;"It's like you know what we should do"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"We should do our longest version ever"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Of Roses Are Free"
01:05:04;01:05:05;"Or were they just"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Trey goes into it"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Trey starts playing it"
01:05:08;01:05:09;"That night"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"And like the guy's like"
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Oh man we're still"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"F***ing shouting these assholes out"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"That's how we were doing this"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"And then"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"And then it gets past"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"The eight minute mark or whatever"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"And they're like"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"What are you doing man?"
01:05:18;01:05:19;"We're going in"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"And then of course"
01:05:20;01:05:21;"My other question is"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"How did Wien come to like"
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Respect Phish?"
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Cause clearly there was"
01:05:25;01:05:26;"Or do they?"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"It sounds like it"
01:05:27;01:05:28;"At least in"
01:05:28;01:05:29;"I wonder if it's just kinda political"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"At this point"
01:05:30;01:05:31;"Yeah those bills start piling up"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"And Dean's like"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"You know what?"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"I respect those guys"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"Yeah I don't know"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"Who knows"
01:05:36;01:05:37;"Man"
01:05:37;01:05:38;"And weren't they the same label?"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"Wasn't there a whole thing"
01:05:39;01:05:40;"In that video about like"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"They're both on Elektra"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Signed by the same person"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"Right"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"There was like an A&R person"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"Named Sue Drew"
01:05:45;01:05:46;"Good name"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"We gotta track her down"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"And she like sent Trey"
01:05:48;01:05:50;"A copy of like Pure Guava"
01:05:50;01:05:51;"And that's how"
01:05:51;01:05:52;"Oh right"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"That's how he got really into it"
01:05:53;01:05:54;"Yeah yeah"
01:05:55;01:05:56;"I'm rolling in"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"I'm wheeling"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Staying on"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"And I'm getting big down"
01:05:59;01:06:04;"Oh evil"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"It's a place"
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Oh it's a place"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"I'm always"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"A big down"
01:06:08;01:06:13;"Dreaming"
01:06:13;01:06:14;"And I'm scared"
01:06:14;01:06:15;"Dreaming"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"And I'm playing"
01:06:16;01:06:17;"Big down"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"Froggy"
01:06:21;01:06:22;"In the meadow"
01:06:22;01:06:23;"Down to the low"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Big down"
01:06:24;01:06:29;"Oh dead wheel"
01:06:29;01:06:30;"Staying"
01:06:30;01:06:31;"And I'm getting big down"
01:06:31;01:06:37;"Oh evil"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"It's a place"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"Oh it's a place"
01:06:39;01:06:40;"I'm always"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"A big down"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"Big down"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"You're listening to"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"T-T-T-T-T-T-T"
01:06:48;01:06:49;"Time Crisis"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"On Beefs 1"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"And speaking of beef"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"I almost don't know if I want to get into this man"
01:06:54;01:06:56;"Cause this is spicy"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"It's rough stuff"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"1975 Imagination Dragons"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"Oh jeez"
01:07:00;01:07:01;"The beef continues"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"So in episode 89"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"We talked about the Instagram post from Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons"
01:07:06;01:07:09;"Following criticisms from Slipknot's Corey Taylor"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Foster the People"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"And the 1975's Matt Healy"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"In addition to Dean and Gene Ween"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"No just kidding"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"Anyway as we talked about"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"Dan from Imagine Dragons wrote a post that said"
01:07:24;01:07:28;"For a decade now I've dealt with critics and other bands saying extremely harsh things about my band"
01:07:28;01:07:30;"Words filled with vile and hate"
01:07:30;01:07:34;"Meant to feed humanity's need to laugh at each other's imperfections and fails"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"And he got into it and he said like"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"And I really respected it because"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"You know on the one hand"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"You know we tell people like"
01:07:41;01:07:44;"Who cares you know you're successful why do you care"
01:07:44;01:07:47;"But it's like we're all human beings and I really do think that"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"The energy you put out into the world sets the tone"
01:07:50;01:07:53;"You're impacting the fabric of life man"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"And also the more we've listened to Imagine Dragons on this program"
01:07:57;01:08:00;"I think even you Jake who is a pretty big hater would have to admit"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"They got a thing going on"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"They have a distinctive palette"
01:08:04;01:08:07;"They have a distinctive palette and also I feel like we listened to a Blake Shelton song"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"What was like a wannabe song and we were just like"
01:08:09;01:08:13;"This really reminds us how Imagine Dragons is doing their thing"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"They're the real deal"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"Sometimes you don't know until you get a fake version"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"That Blake Shelton was awful"
01:08:18;01:08:23;"I think even you, Copped, do that song being terrible"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"And of course I respect him to the utmost as an artist"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"But yeah that was not my favorite song"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"And as a businessman"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"As an entrepreneur"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"So anyway"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Mark Foster actually apologized"
01:08:33;01:08:34;"Right"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"Mark Foster thought about it and was like"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"You know what man I don't know why I said something mean about you"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And nobody else I think really like apologized or anything"
01:08:41;01:08:44;"But you know maybe you can't expect everybody to like get into it"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"You know maybe some people saw what he said and they took it and they're like alright"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Fair point and just left it at that"
01:08:49;01:08:53;"But I guess Maddie, the singer from the 1975 doubled down"
01:08:53;01:08:58;"And actually somebody I think sent this to me or tagged me in it on Instagram when it happened"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"And I remember watching it and I was like whoa this is harsh"
01:09:01;01:09:04;"And again I like all these bands I think they're all doing something"
01:09:04;01:09:08;"But this is what the guy from 1975 originally said"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"He was talking to Q Magazine"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"He said songs like Radioactive by Imagine Dragons"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"It might as well be called Pikachu Banana"
01:09:14;01:09:15;"It's nothingness"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"There's no space for nothingness anymore"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"And pop music has so much space for it"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"What the hell does that even mean?"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"Well okay first of all"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"There's no space for nothingness"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"And pop music has so much space for it?"
01:09:27;01:09:30;"I think he was saying I hear this song Radioactive"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"And it might as well literally be a jumble of meaningless words"
01:09:33;01:09:36;"Because it's about nothing"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"And we're living in a crisis moment"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"So when he says there's no space for nothingness anymore"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"He's basically saying we don't have time for nothingness anymore"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"And pop music is so full of this"
01:09:46;01:09:50;"So you know if I was already trying to be very objective"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"And look past the emotion of that"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"I might say well first of all man"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"If you really want to go in on pop music"
01:09:58;01:10:02;"You did pick some real low hanging fruit"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"People make fun of Imagine Dragons all the time"
01:10:04;01:10:08;"If you really wanted to get into the nothingness of pop music"
01:10:08;01:10:11;"There's probably a few critical pop darlings"
01:10:11;01:10:14;"That are coasting on some nothingness rhetoric"
01:10:14;01:10:18;"If you really wanted to use your platform to start puncturing the nothingness of pop music"
01:10:18;01:10:21;"You know it's almost like all the people running"
01:10:21;01:10:23;"I'm really into the political metaphors lately"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"It's like all the Democrats running"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"It's like yeah any Democrat can get on stage and just be like"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"Donald Trump bad guy"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"I don't like him do you?"
01:10:32;01:10:33;"Democracy's in jeopardy folks"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"You can say these very general things about how Trump sucks"
01:10:36;01:10:40;"Because basically every Democrat or left leaning person"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Agrees that Trump sucks"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"Where people differentiate themselves is when they say stuff like"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"But Donald Trump is not the only"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Didn't start the problem"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"And let me tell you exactly what the problem is"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"Or let me talk about"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"Somebody who appears to some as liberal"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Like a Jeff Bezos who's not paying a nickel"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"You know like the Bernie model is like"
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Yeah of course Trump's trash"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"But it'll also point out"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"But you know there's these other people who we don't talk about as much"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Who are contributing to the evils of our society"
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Whatever"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"So I'm just saying like if you really wanted to like"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"You know shoot some arrows at the nothingness of pop music"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"I'm not gonna name names"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Because you know that's not my style"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"But I'm saying you could use your interview space"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"To go after some things besides Imagine Dragons"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"But also I don't want to stand up for a song"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"That I haven't spent that much time with"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"So let's look at Radioactive"
01:11:24;01:11:29;"Sounds like the Big Little Lies"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"Oh yeah"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Soundtrack"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"Big Little Lies ripped this song off"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"Did you watch season 2?"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"Not yet I've only seen one episode"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"They're all street"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"I mean"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"Of course"
01:11:40;01:11:44;"How sick would it be if this was the opening song of Big Little Lies?"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"I mean I could see it"
01:11:46;01:11:56;"I'm waking up to ash and dust"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust"
01:11:59;01:12:00;"I don't know this one"
01:12:00;01:12:03;"Breathing in the catacombs"
01:12:03;01:12:05;"Yeah"
01:12:05;01:12:10;"I'm breaking in, shaping up"
01:12:10;01:12:13;"Been checking out on the prison bus"
01:12:13;01:12:17;"This is it, the apocalypse"
01:12:17;01:12:18;"Oh"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"I'm waking up"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"I feel it in my bones"
01:12:23;01:12:26;"Enough to make my system blow"
01:12:26;01:12:29;"Welcome to the new age"
01:12:29;01:12:30;"To the new age"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Welcome to the new age"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"To the new age"
01:12:34;01:12:41;"Sounds like a post-apocalyptic landscape he's describing"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"I'm not gonna say I know what that song's about but"
01:12:43;01:12:46;"That sounds like a Mad Max kind of scenario"
01:12:46;01:12:50;"Well yeah it's at least gesturing towards stuff like the apocalypse"
01:12:50;01:12:51;"Prison bus"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"Some dark subject matter"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"And look of course"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"That seems like a random song to single out for being about nothing"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"I know cause there's"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"There's a lot of songs that are just like"
01:13:02;01:13:03;"I'm rich!"
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Hey!"
01:13:04;01:13:05;"I bought this thing"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"I'm awesome"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"And look there's legitimately great artists"
01:13:09;01:13:15;"Who sometimes make statements that would be seemingly hard to defend"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"In terms of just being like vapid materialist statements"
01:13:18;01:13:21;"And yet they're creatively very interesting"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"If you wanted to bend yourself a little bit into a new perspective"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"You could probably say like well when that person makes that vapid materialist statement"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"There is an element of satire in it"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"You know I'm just saying you can always find that"
01:13:31;01:13:32;"Like Gene Simmons"
01:13:32;01:13:33;"Yeah"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day"
01:13:36;01:13:40;"I'm just saying like on it's face this is at least gesturing towards serious stuff"
01:13:40;01:13:41;"The apocalypse"
01:13:41;01:13:42;"Right"
01:13:42;01:13:43;"A revolution"
01:13:43;01:13:47;"And again like with song lyrics it's not always easy to say exactly what it's about"
01:13:47;01:13:54;"It wouldn't be crazy to say that this is a song about somebody entering a phase of life"
01:13:54;01:14:00;"Or a moment in time that is so alienating that they feel like they're radioactive"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"That's kind of what it is on it's face right"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"Whether this is literally"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"So it's like a meta- okay"
01:14:04;01:14:07;"So if the metaphor of this song is like"
01:14:07;01:14:11;"You're on a prison bus and like you're entering like a world of pain"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Whether it's prison or the apocalypse"
01:14:13;01:14:16;"And you feel like so alienated that you feel like I'm radioactive"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"He feels stupid and contagious"
01:14:18;01:14:19;"I feel stupid"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Yeah same thing that Kurt said"
01:14:20;01:14:21;"Yeah"
01:14:21;01:14:25;"So at the very least you could say this is a song about feeling alienated maybe"
01:14:25;01:14:29;"Or a song about entering a confusing painful period"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"All I'm saying is it's not vapid on it's face"
01:14:32;01:14:37;"If anything you know you could go like English Majorana and be like well it's vapid inside"
01:14:37;01:14:42;"Because you know the Kurt Cobain version would have better imagery and have more ambiguity or something"
01:14:42;01:14:43;"But at least on it's face"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"Kurt was more direct in a weird way anyway"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"I think I might agree with 1975 on this one"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"And I'm changed by listening to that"
01:14:50;01:14:51;"That it's nothingness"
01:14:51;01:14:55;"Well I think the problem is what you're saying is I think that it's trafficking"
01:14:55;01:14:56;"It's pretentious"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"No but in like signifiers of"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"Right"
01:15:00;01:15:04;"Politics like just talk about the flag and the prison bus like I know what you're saying"
01:15:04;01:15:08;"But like it is like it's pretty like empty"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"Sure"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Empty metaphor or sign-"
01:15:10;01:15:14;"But specifically that it's about politics right"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"It's like you're not just talking about the apocalypse or post apocalypse"
01:15:18;01:15:19;"Yeah maybe but"
01:15:19;01:15:24;"You feel like they're leeching out of the credibility of these like heavy subject matter"
01:15:24;01:15:30;"In order to give this mediocre song some gravitas it doesn't quite deserve or something"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"That's probably what yeah"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"I see both sides"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"I'm saying that's one way to look at it"
01:15:35;01:15:40;"Cause I always try to check myself and say like the reason that you know say like you know"
01:15:40;01:15:43;"I love like Leonard Cohen or that's one of my favorite artists or something"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"Yeah"
01:15:44;01:15:51;"It's partially because I think he his lyrics and his songwriting hit at interesting ideas about"
01:15:51;01:15:55;"What it means to be a person and life and society and all that"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"But at the same time I also can take a step back and say"
01:15:58;01:16:04;"Why does a Leonard Cohen song about alienation speak more to me than an Imagine Dragons song"
01:16:04;01:16:08;"And you'll be like well you know it's partially because of the music I liked growing up"
01:16:08;01:16:13;"My background you know Leonard Cohen's from Montreal closer to the east coast"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"Than the Imagine Dragons"
01:16:15;01:16:18;"Also you're like a connoisseur of songwriting and you're a close listener"
01:16:18;01:16:21;"And also Leonard Cohen's like a poet he's like an English major dude"
01:16:21;01:16:23;"We just got more in common in a way"
01:16:23;01:16:26;"But the idea that somebody couldn't also like somebody might also hear Leonard Cohen"
01:16:26;01:16:30;"And be like I don't have time for this like this song makes me feel like I'm radioactive"
01:16:30;01:16:33;"That's how I feel right now I literally feel like an alienated person"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"And that image of like checking out on the prison bus"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Whoa that's like what I felt like I was taking a regular bus going to my job"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"And it felt like a prison bus"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"And you know I could look at that interpretation and be like"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"There's so much deeper music out there"
01:16:45;01:16:48;"Or I could just like be like they nailed something for somebody"
01:16:48;01:16:52;"This is why you're not a music critic"
01:16:52;01:16:58;"This is a very egalitarian open armed loving embrace of pop and rock and roll"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"Although some music critics do that"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Well that's also a funny thing because"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Not with Imagine Dragons"
01:17:03;01:17:04;"Yeah not with Imagine Dragons"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"Are there any like prominent music critics who are just like"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"New Imagine Dragons is out 8.8 out of 10"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"New York Times did a whole thing"
01:17:11;01:17:15;"New York Times had an article a couple months ago about re-evaluating Hootie and the Blowfish"
01:17:15;01:17:16;"And giving them a chance"
01:17:16;01:17:19;"Cause Hootie and the Blowfish were like the Imagine Dragons of the 90s"
01:17:19;01:17:20;"Yeah in a way"
01:17:20;01:17:22;"Everybody kind of funny name everybody ripped on them"
01:17:22;01:17:23;"Yeah"
01:17:23;01:17:26;"And literally the I think the tone of the article was a little bit like"
01:17:26;01:17:30;"Honestly this isn't bad and some of it's actually kind of good"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"And why did people hate them so much"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"That was like the big question"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"And I think"
01:17:35;01:17:36;"That's so funny"
01:17:36;01:17:37;"I could imagine in 20 years"
01:17:37;01:17:38;"Oh yeah dude"
01:17:38;01:17:39;"The next generation being like"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"Wait why did people hate that so much"
01:17:41;01:17:45;"It's like I kind of love it like that's that real 2017 sound"
01:17:45;01:17:47;"So whatever that's what Matty Healy said"
01:17:47;01:17:49;"Okay so then what happened"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"And look every time I've heard 1975 I always thought it was cool"
01:17:52;01:17:54;"I don't know if his lyrics"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"See I also just kind of wonder"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"Like what's the big 1975 song"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"Throw that on"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"I've never been a fan of that band"
01:18:01;01:18:02;"I've tried to listen"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"Cause like I remember they had an album come out earlier this year"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Maybe last year"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"And it was like a lot of buzz"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"A lot of like critical love"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"I know a lot of people were looking out for 1975"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"I remember just being like really"
01:18:14;01:18:17;"And in fact I think we talked about this earlier"
01:18:17;01:18:21;"And I remember expressing some skepticism towards the 1975"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"And people on Twitter being like"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"Dude you're totally missing the boat on this one"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Right"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"They rule"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"And that's the funny thing"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"I could relate to both bands"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"Because Vampire Weekend is the type of band who"
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Oh yeah"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Has you know one way of looking at it"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"From some people is like"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Oh this band is lightweight"
01:18:36;01:18:37;"This band is stupid"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"And then other people are like"
01:18:38;01:18:39;"Oh no this band is pretentious"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"And 1975 gets called pretentious a lot"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"Right"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"That's one thing I know"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Just from a tiny bit of following the"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Sure"
01:18:46;01:18:47;"The discourse"
01:18:47;01:18:48;"This is their top song on Apple Music"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"It's called Somebody Else"
01:18:50;01:18:53;"Is this off the album from this year"
01:18:53;01:18:56;"Uh no this is from 2016"
01:18:56;01:18:57;"Yeah"
01:18:57;01:19:02;"Kind of Hornsby tones"
01:19:02;01:19:03;"Which is tight"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Although"
01:19:04;01:19:05;"Gotta give Boney Bear props"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"For the first person to"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"Bring that territory"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"So I heard"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"I found"
01:19:14;01:19:17;"Somebody else"
01:19:17;01:19:21;"And at first"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I thought"
01:19:23;01:19:26;"It was a lie"
01:19:26;01:19:30;"What's the top vampire song on iTunes"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Is it Apunk?"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"I would guess Apunk"
01:19:33;01:19:34;"Uh huh"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"So someone that was just like"
01:19:36;01:19:37;"Yeah man"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"There's some other radio show"
01:19:39;01:19:40;"It's a very unscientific way"
01:19:40;01:19:41;"They're talking about vampire"
01:19:41;01:19:42;"And they're just like"
01:19:42;01:19:43;"What's the top"
01:19:43;01:19:44;"Who was vampire week"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"Maybe like"
01:19:45;01:19:46;"No like a Mike Francesca"
01:19:46;01:19:47;"Like style sports"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"Top radio show"
01:19:48;01:19:49;"Somehow you come up"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"What was this vampire weekend"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"What's their top song"
01:19:53;01:19:54;"Our top three songs are"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"Apunk, This Life, Harmony Hall"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"Oh that's pretty representative"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"But if you just listen to Apunk"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Yeah it's from 12 years ago"
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Whatever"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"Looking through your body"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"Looking through your phone"
01:20:07;01:20:11;"And you're leaving with somebody else"
01:20:11;01:20:15;"This sounds cool"
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Yeah it is cool"
01:20:16;01:20:17;"I like it"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"But again just"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"He's talking about lyrics mostly I think"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"So the lyrics to this song"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"So I heard you found somebody else"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"And at first I thought it was a lie"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"I took all my things that make sounds"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"The rest I can do without"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"I don't quite have time to"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"Unpack that right now"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"But it's cool"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"I don't want your body"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"But I hate to think about you with somebody else"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"That's some real s***"
01:20:38;01:20:39;"People break up with somebody"
01:20:39;01:20:40;"Then they get jealous"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"How does that make any sense"
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Human condition man"
01:20:43;01:20:44;"Our love has gone cold"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"You're intertwining your soul with somebody else"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"That's a bad feeling"
01:20:48;01:20:49;"We've all been there"
01:20:49;01:20:50;"Intertwining"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"I'm looking through you"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"While you're looking through your phone"
01:20:53;01:20:54;"And then leaving off with somebody else"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"No I don't want your body"
01:20:55;01:20:56;"But I'm picturing your body with somebody else"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"Come on baby"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"This ain't the last time that I'll see your face"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Come on baby"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"You said you'd find someone to take my place"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"I just don't believe that you've got it in you"
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Because we're just gonna keep doing it"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"I hope he means having sex"
01:21:07;01:21:08;"We're just gonna keep doing it"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"And every time I start to believe in anything you're saying"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"I'm reminded that I should be getting over it"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"I don't want your body"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Okay so"
01:21:15;01:21:16;"So they're still doing it"
01:21:16;01:21:17;"After the breakup"
01:21:17;01:21:19;"I would say based on my"
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Very lightweight reading of the song"
01:21:21;01:21:24;"It's an accurate and tasteful portrayal"
01:21:24;01:21:27;"Of some of the mixed emotions of a breakup"
01:21:27;01:21:28;"I'm done with you"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"And yet I can't quit you"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"I don't want you"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"But I also don't want you"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"Doing it with somebody else"
01:21:34;01:21:35;"Jealousy"
01:21:35;01:21:36;"Repulsion"
01:21:36;01:21:37;"Whatever okay"
01:21:37;01:21:38;"Alright I'm with it"
01:21:38;01:21:39;"The funny thing is"
01:21:39;01:21:40;"That"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"And I bet 1975 fans might be like"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"Oh that's not even like the right song"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"And again"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Yeah I'm sure"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"I like that song"
01:21:47;01:21:48;"And I like the 1975"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"This is me taking a step back"
01:21:49;01:21:51;"And not even trying to be judgmental"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"But it is just funny to think like"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"If it was like 1982"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"And we put those lyrics side by side"
01:21:56;01:21:57;"And we found some just like"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"Badass alienated kid"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Like from the suburbs"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"We'd be like"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"Here's a song about having mixed feelings"
01:22:03;01:22:04;"After a breakup"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"And he'd probably be like"
01:22:05;01:22:06;"This sounds like"
01:22:06;01:22:07;"F*** Phil Collins"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Right"
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Man"
01:22:09;01:22:10;"How does this speak to me about my life"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"I'm so alienated"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"I've never even had a girlfriend"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"And then like"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"This is like a post apocalyptic"
01:22:16;01:22:17;"And he'd be like"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Now this guy"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"He's talking about feeling radioactive"
01:22:20;01:22:21;"This is what I've been trying to say"
01:22:21;01:22:23;"In Reagan's America man"
01:22:23;01:22:24;"You know I'm just saying like one"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"Radioactive actually"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"In a way just"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"It's like weirder"
01:22:28;01:22:29;"I dig it man"
01:22:29;01:22:30;"I dig where you're at"
01:22:30;01:22:31;"And I'm just saying"
01:22:31;01:22:32;"I'm not even saying"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"Therefore it's better"
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Cause I don't feel that way"
01:22:34;01:22:35;"Look at the end of the day"
01:22:35;01:22:38;"1975 probably does line up more with my taste"
01:22:38;01:22:39;"Sure"
01:22:39;01:22:40;"You know they're from England"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"But you know that's almost as close"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"To the east coast as Nevada"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"But the idea of what is or is not"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"Nothingness"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"It's obviously just perspective"
01:22:51;01:22:53;"I think that you could find really deep stuff"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"In terms of a song about breakups"
01:22:55;01:22:57;"Or how you feel in that moment"
01:22:57;01:22:59;"And you know it just depends on your mood"
01:22:59;01:23:00;"And what you need to hear"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"The idea that one is like"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"You know it's not like comparing"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"Baby shark to"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Imagine by John Lennon"
01:23:08;01:23:09;"That's pretty cut and dry"
01:23:09;01:23:10;"Cause you could be like"
01:23:10;01:23:11;"What's baby shark about"
01:23:11;01:23:13;"You're like this is a song literally made"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"Just to put a smile on baby's faces"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"But what's it about man"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"It literally is not about anything"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"This song was made to be catchy"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"And bouncy and make kids smile"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"But who's the shark"
01:23:23;01:23:24;"That doesn't matter"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"It literally doesn't matter"
01:23:26;01:23:27;"And then be like"
01:23:27;01:23:28;"What's John Lennon saying"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"When he says"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"You know imagine there's no countries"
01:23:31;01:23:33;"He's making a very clear cut statement"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"About the ways that we divide up humanity"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"And is there another way"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"That we could organize ourselves"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"And would it be better and more peaceful"
01:23:41;01:23:42;"And I gotta say"
01:23:42;01:23:43;"Call me crazy"
01:23:43;01:23:44;"But I think there's more meat to that"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Than baby shark"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"You know like obviously"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"That's just like"
01:23:47;01:23:48;"That's a slam dunk"
01:23:48;01:23:49;"This is a matter of taste"
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Yep"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"I would say"
01:23:51;01:24:09;"I'm barely running"
01:24:09;01:24:11;"Through some complications"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"He falls asleep during conversations"
01:24:15;01:24:21;"He's got a sister's dream"
01:24:21;01:24:23;"Where he's on vacation"
01:24:23;01:24:29;"The worst thing is that"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"I'm in the same situation"
01:24:31;01:24:38;"Oh I do see"
01:24:38;01:24:42;"Think about you"
01:24:42;01:24:45;"I do what you do"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"Collapse my brains"
01:24:47;01:24:49;"With beautiful shoes"
01:24:49;01:24:53;"Smile even if it's not with you"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"So that's what he said"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"And then he got to Dan"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"Almost said Dan Healy"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"Clearly in my mind"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"I'm just starting to turn Imagine Dragons"
01:25:01;01:25:03;"And 1975 into one band"
01:25:03;01:25:04;"They should merge"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"They should become a Borg"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"They're clones exactly"
01:25:07;01:25:08;"They're clones should merge"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"So anyway that's what he said"
01:25:10;01:25:11;"And that's what"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"One of the things that hurt Dan Reynolds' feelings"
01:25:13;01:25:14;"Okay so then what happened?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"Then it came up again"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"In June Healy responded to"
01:25:17;01:25:19;"Was asked whether or not bands have responsibility"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"To talk about social and political issues"
01:25:21;01:25:22;"There's no point now"
01:25:22;01:25:23;"In like taking up so much space"
01:25:23;01:25:25;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:25:25;01:25:27;"Like I think I've been accused of like"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"Maybe having a go at people about that"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"Do you see that guy from like Imagine Dragons?"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"He liked him"
01:25:33;01:25:34;"He went online quite recently"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"Okay first of all it's Imagination Dragons"
01:25:36;01:25:37;"Very disrespectful"
01:25:37;01:25:38;"How dare you"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"He's kind of like"
01:25:39;01:25:41;"Everybody's like slagging off my band"
01:25:41;01:25:42;"Everyone's like saying that like"
01:25:42;01:25:44;"Not good enough or whatever"
01:25:44;01:25:45;"And he was like Billy Corgan said it"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"And Matty from the 1975 said it"
01:25:47;01:25:48;"And I was like yeah bro like"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"I didn't say that"
01:25:50;01:25:51;"You didn't build that"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"No and even if I did say that like"
01:25:52;01:25:53;"Why do you care?"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"You're a millionaire in a huge band"
01:25:55;01:25:57;"Like you don't go"
01:25:57;01:25:58;"Oh I'm gonna do this"
01:25:58;01:26:01;"And also can I be void of criticism?"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"Okay that part bothered me a little bit"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"Saying something provocative"
01:26:05;01:26:06;"And then somebody reacting and saying"
01:26:06;01:26:07;"Why do you care?"
01:26:07;01:26:09;"Is just like a classic"
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Like whack avoidance strategy"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"Anybody's had that experience"
01:26:13;01:26:15;"Where somebody maybe says something"
01:26:15;01:26:17;"A little mean or provocative towards you"
01:26:17;01:26:18;"And you're just like"
01:26:18;01:26:19;"Why would you say that?"
01:26:19;01:26:21;"Oh my god why do you care?"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"You're like because you said something rude"
01:26:23;01:26:24;"You know it's just like"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"It's a funny avoidance strategy"
01:26:26;01:26:29;"Where you're not really owning up to what you said"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"And like yeah"
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Saying that somebody's music is nothingness"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"Is like a harsh criticism"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"Again not saying that you're not allowed"
01:26:36;01:26:37;"To make that criticism"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"But if you say it"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"And then somebody says like"
01:26:39;01:26:40;"I thought that was rude"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Say dude why do you care?"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"If it matters so little"
01:26:44;01:26:45;"If it matters so little"
01:26:45;01:26:46;"You didn't need to say it"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"And then his argument"
01:26:47;01:26:49;"That the reason you shouldn't care"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Is because you're a millionaire in a huge band"
01:26:52;01:26:54;"Okay well you're two millionaires in huge bands"
01:26:54;01:26:57;"You're Trump and Hillary going at each other"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"You're both wealthy people"
01:26:58;01:27:00;"Talking about how important it is"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"To you know do stuff for the people"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"You have that in common"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"So again it's like weird to say"
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Dude why do you care?"
01:27:07;01:27:09;"You're a rich guy in a band"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"Go just be a rich guy in a band"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"And it's like well you know"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"You're taking it there"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"So again he seems like a nice guy"
01:27:15;01:27:16;"But I was just kind of like"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"I don't buy that part"
01:27:17;01:27:18;"Come on man"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"But that's not the point"
01:27:19;01:27:20;"My point wasn't that"
01:27:20;01:27:21;"Imagine Dragons aren't good"
01:27:21;01:27:22;"I don't care"
01:27:22;01:27:25;"Like if you're that big"
01:27:25;01:27:29;"If you're like the biggest alternative band"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"In America radio play wise"
01:27:31;01:27:34;"And you are saying nothing in your music"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"If you're just saying words"
01:27:36;01:27:37;"Radioactive"
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa"
01:27:38;01:27:39;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:27:39;01:27:40;"It's like"
01:27:40;01:27:41;"I'm not I'm not"
01:27:42;01:27:43;"I'm sure that they're like"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"That's too much"
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Oh yeah"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"This is a politician playing"
01:27:46;01:27:48;"At their own rally"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"Oh yeah"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"And everyone's like yeah"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Hold on hold on hold on"
01:27:52;01:27:54;"Hold on folks"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"Okay I guess maybe the reason"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"That this whole thing like"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Weighed on me a little bit"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Is because clearly"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I can relate to both of these people"
01:28:01;01:28:02;"And I would imagine that"
01:28:02;01:28:04;"Again sensibility wise"
01:28:04;01:28:05;"Well I don't know"
01:28:05;01:28:06;"Van Perrigan doesn't sound like"
01:28:06;01:28:08;"Either one of these bands really"
01:28:08;01:28:09;"But I know more people"
01:28:09;01:28:11;"Who like the 1975 than I do"
01:28:11;01:28:12;"Who are Imagine Dragons fans"
01:28:12;01:28:13;"Sure"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"So at least in my general milieu"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"I'm surrounded by more 1975 enthusiasts"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"But I'm just saying like"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"What I've heard so far in this"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"It just sounds so inside baseball to me"
01:28:22;01:28:24;"Because if the larger point is like"
01:28:24;01:28:27;"Dude you're doing meaningless stuff in music"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"When the world's on fire right"
01:28:29;01:28:31;"And I've heard a lot of people make it"
01:28:31;01:28:32;"When they're trying to diss somebody else"
01:28:32;01:28:34;"I guess to me"
01:28:34;01:28:37;"What I sometimes hear"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Is professional competition"
01:28:40;01:28:41;"Professional jealousy"
01:28:41;01:28:44;"Under the guise of like"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"Fixing the world"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"And I think we see that very often"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"Even politics"
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Where literally the job is supposed to be"
01:28:50;01:28:51;"About fixing the world"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"Or at least the country"
01:28:52;01:28:54;"You sometimes feel like"
01:28:54;01:28:56;"You're watching this empty display of people"
01:28:56;01:28:58;"You guys say all this stuff in the debate"
01:28:58;01:29:00;"And then whoever's going to be president"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"Is just going to go back to the typical"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Centrist, democrat thing"
01:29:04;01:29:05;"So it's like"
01:29:05;01:29:06;"And it's almost like we know that"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"It's like everybody knows"
01:29:08;01:29:10;"That we're watching people have this debate"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"About who has like the better ideas"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"And stands for more"
01:29:13;01:29:14;"But at the end of the day"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"You're just going to go back to what you do"
01:29:16;01:29:17;"And in the case of being a musician"
01:29:17;01:29:18;"What you do is"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Is go fly around on planes"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"All over the world"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"And make money"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"And try to build your brand"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"And there are artists"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"And we know like legitimately"
01:29:28;01:29:30;"Independent artists who like"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Do things that aren't good for their career"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Because they have deeply held values"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"About like climate change or something"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Somebody's like"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"I'm not going to fly to New York"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"To go do a radio show"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"I'm not going to fly to Chicago"
01:29:42;01:29:43;"To go do a radio show"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"That's like extra emissions"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"So in that sense"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"And I'm certainly not absolving myself"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"It's like you know"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"When Van Bergen's got a new album coming out"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"We schlep around the world to do press"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"And you know"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"When people tell me"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"You should go do this"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Because it's going to like"
01:29:57;01:29:58;"Help more people hear that the record's out"
01:29:58;01:29:59;"I'm like okay"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"Cool"
01:30:00;01:30:01;"That's like what we're supposed to do"
01:30:01;01:30:03;"I don't have like an alternate philosophy"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Maybe one day I will"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"But I guess what I'm saying is like"
01:30:06;01:30:07;"There's a bit of narcissism"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"A small difference I think"
01:30:09;01:30:10;"Let's see what else you've got to say"
01:30:10;01:30:11;"But it's just"
01:30:11;01:30:12;"What's the point?"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"Like if you can tell me"
01:30:13;01:30:14;"What the point is"
01:30:14;01:30:15;"Apart from escapism"
01:30:15;01:30:16;"Like then"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"And we like"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"I bet"
01:30:18;01:30:19;"I bet that the guy from"
01:30:19;01:30:20;"But see that's"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"That's the only bummer thing"
01:30:21;01:30:22;"And maybe we've got to get"
01:30:22;01:30:23;"These guys in a room together"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"That was always"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"I mean escape"
01:30:25;01:30:26;"Yeah"
01:30:26;01:30:27;"We always talked about"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"The time crisis town hall"
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Right right"
01:30:29;01:30:30;"Squashing the beef"
01:30:30;01:30:31;"We did"
01:30:31;01:30:32;"1975 and Imagine Dragons"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"They're going to come in"
01:30:33;01:30:34;"Fish and ween"
01:30:35;01:30:36;"Big double header"
01:30:36;01:30:37;"Fish and ween"
01:30:37;01:30:38;"Let's go"
01:30:38;01:30:39;"We're in Miller"
01:30:39;01:30:40;"It really hurt my feelings"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"That you waited until"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"One of my best friends"
01:30:42;01:30:43;"My big brother"
01:30:43;01:30:44;"Jerry Garcia died"
01:30:44;01:30:45;"To say these horrible things"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"About our music"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"You were perfectly happy"
01:30:47;01:30:48;"To stand on stage"
01:30:48;01:30:49;"And jam with us"
01:30:49;01:30:50;"And I'm like"
01:30:50;01:30:51;"I'm not going to do that"
01:30:51;01:30:52;"I'm going to jam with us"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"During that 1991 tour"
01:30:55;01:30:57;"That really hurt my feelings Steve"
01:30:57;01:30:58;"Bob I don't respect you"
01:30:58;01:30:59;"I never have"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"Interview over"
01:31:01;01:31:04;"But Steve Mr. Miller"
01:31:04;01:31:05;"You've written some good songs"
01:31:05;01:31:06;"I like the Joker"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"I like Fly Like an Eagle"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"But I'm sure you could admit"
01:31:10;01:31:11;"That it was hypocritical of you"
01:31:11;01:31:13;"To open for us on that tour"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"We paid you handsomely"
01:31:15;01:31:16;"And then you wait until"
01:31:16;01:31:17;"My big brother Jerry Garcia"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"Dies to say these horrendous things"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"I mean don't you feel bad"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"When you think about that"
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Not at all Bob"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"When I think back to that"
01:31:27;01:31:29;"90 whatever it was"
01:31:29;01:31:31;"When I think back to that 1992 tour"
01:31:31;01:31:33;"And I think about the fact"
01:31:33;01:31:34;"That I stood on stage"
01:31:34;01:31:35;"With you losers"
01:31:35;01:31:36;"And got to play"
01:31:36;01:31:37;"To your massive crowds"
01:31:37;01:31:38;"And win them over"
01:31:38;01:31:39;"And walk away"
01:31:39;01:31:41;"From the Grateful Dead show"
01:31:41;01:31:43;"With 1 to 5 thousand"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"New Steve Miller band fans"
01:31:45;01:31:46;"And to know on top of it"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"That I was getting paid"
01:31:48;01:31:50;"Well that just makes me smart"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"And it makes you stupid"
01:31:52;01:31:54;"And I would do it all over again"
01:31:54;01:31:55;"Your music is trash"
01:31:55;01:31:56;"And I thought that"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"As I was jamming with you"
01:31:58;01:32:00;"I had to breathe through my mouth"
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Cause I was disgusted"
01:32:02;01:32:03;"By how you smelled"
01:32:03;01:32:05;"And how you jammed"
01:32:05;01:32:07;"But I did it for a reason"
01:32:07;01:32:08;"And that was to build"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"The Steve Miller band brand"
01:32:10;01:32:11;"And mission accomplished"
01:32:11;01:32:13;"And you know what"
01:32:13;01:32:16;"If you look at the number of radio plays"
01:32:16;01:32:20;"On the syndicated Classic Rock Radio format nationally"
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Steve Miller wipes the floor"
01:32:22;01:32:23;"With the Grateful Dead"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"Radio play wise"
01:32:25;01:32:29;"Okay the Grateful Dead may have sold more tickets"
01:32:29;01:32:31;"But radio play wise"
01:32:31;01:32:32;"Where's your joker"
01:32:32;01:32:33;"Truckin?"
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Are you kidding me?"
01:32:34;01:32:36;"You might hear truckin"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"Once a week"
01:32:37;01:32:39;"In select markets"
01:32:39;01:32:40;"In select markets"
01:32:40;01:32:43;"Maybe on like some sort of Sunday morning show"
01:32:43;01:32:44;"You're gonna hear"
01:32:44;01:32:45;"Black and Eagle"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"Take the money and run"
01:32:47;01:32:50;"Abracadabra"
01:32:50;01:32:53;"I took the money and I ran"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"Like that"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"Abracadabra"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"Steve I can't believe my ears"
01:32:58;01:33:00;"You're a terrible person"
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Yeah well you gotta be a terrible person"
01:33:02;01:33:04;"You don't know what I've been through Bob"
01:33:04;01:33:07;"Put on your big boy pants"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Like a Batman villain or something"
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Rough stuff folks"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"Bob Weir is a mess"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"Get him out of here"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"So in this analogy"
01:33:16;01:33:19;"Imagine Dragons guy is Bob Weir"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"Although it's backwards"
01:33:20;01:33:22;"And 1995 guy is Steve Miller"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"No but it's backwards because"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"Oh yes it's because"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"Imagine Dragons is the radio"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Imagine Dragons is more the Steve Miller"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"And the 1975 is more the Grateful Dead"
01:33:29;01:33:32;"Well let's listen to what else this guy says"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"I'll be shh with like protest music nowadays as a society"
01:33:35;01:33:36;"Like look at like after 9/11"
01:33:36;01:33:39;"Like that was so hard for the country to deal with"
01:33:39;01:33:41;"Everybody's listening to f***ing Jack Johnson"
01:33:41;01:33:42;"Norah Jones"
01:33:42;01:33:43;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:33:43;01:33:44;"Everybody"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"Well you gotta drag them into it"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"Well you could have said The Strokes too"
01:33:48;01:33:49;"Which is a band he probably loves"
01:33:49;01:33:50;"And The Strokes are like"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"Completely meaningless songs"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"In the greatest way"
01:33:53;01:33:54;"I wouldn't say that"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"But they did take the song New York City Cops"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Off the album"
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Because it was post 9/11"
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Oh wow I didn't even know that"
01:34:00;01:34:01;"I just think of like their hits"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"Last night"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"Baby"
01:34:04;01:34:05;"Like it's just like"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"They're fun rock songs"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"They're great"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"I guess in a way I almost gotta respect Steve Miller"
01:34:09;01:34:11;"Because it's like there's so much"
01:34:11;01:34:12;"Yeah"
01:34:12;01:34:13;"And also again"
01:34:13;01:34:16;"Just because Steve Miller"
01:34:16;01:34:18;"He didn't try to hide behind"
01:34:18;01:34:19;"You know Steve Miller could have been like"
01:34:19;01:34:20;"You know what man"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"You know the spirit of the 60s and the 70s"
01:34:23;01:34:25;"It was about people like us"
01:34:25;01:34:28;"And other well regarded musicians"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"Like The Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Because you know what I got no time for man"
01:34:32;01:34:33;"Was Neil Diamond"
01:34:33;01:34:34;"And then like you know"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Whoever he was doing the interview with"
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Would have been like yeah right on"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"We don't like Neil Diamond"
01:34:37;01:34:38;"We like rock music"
01:34:38;01:34:39;"Yeah yeah"
01:34:39;01:34:40;"And he would have been aligning himself"
01:34:40;01:34:41;"But see he went after"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"He went after a"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"A legend"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Yeah"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"And also this isn't fair"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"I'll fully admit that this isn't fair to the 1975"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"But there is just that part of me that"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"This happens a lot when I hear about a situation like this"
01:34:52;01:34:55;"Somebody's like being harsh on somebody else"
01:34:55;01:34:56;"I'm always like come on man"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"Why can't everybody be a little more cool with each other"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"But then there's always that devil on my shoulder"
01:35:00;01:35:01;"That's always like"
01:35:01;01:35:02;"But if you wanna go to war"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"Go to war"
01:35:03;01:35:04;"I mean I guess my point"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"Yeah sometimes when I see somebody like"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"Say something that I find unnecessarily harsh"
01:35:08;01:35:09;"Which again I hope"
01:35:09;01:35:11;"If anything I'm not dissing him"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"I would love to see this resolved"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"Let's just get to the bottom of it"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"I just don't like unnecessary harshness floating out there"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"And I do think"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"From everything that I know about his music"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"I would say that Maddie"
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Similar to Dan"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Both actually seem like thoughtful people"
01:35:26;01:35:27;"And actually I don't think"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"Matt Healy seems like the type of dude"
01:35:29;01:35:33;"Who would be above revising his critique"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"But I'm just saying in this moment"
01:35:34;01:35:37;"He's doing a promotional interview"
01:35:37;01:35:38;"With a radio station for his band"
01:35:38;01:35:40;"To promote his band and his brand"
01:35:40;01:35:42;"He's thinking more about himself as a person"
01:35:42;01:35:45;"And the 1975 in terms of their"
01:35:45;01:35:46;"What they represent"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"And sometimes to make a case"
01:35:48;01:35:50;"For what you or your brand band"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"Corporate entity"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"Your corporate entity represents"
01:35:52;01:35:54;"You have to say"
01:35:54;01:35:55;"Here's what we got"
01:35:55;01:35:57;"That going on that's better than Coke"
01:35:57;01:35:58;"You know like we're Pepsi"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Our market share is not as big"
01:36:00;01:36:01;"But here's what we got going on"
01:36:01;01:36:02;"That those losers don't have"
01:36:02;01:36:03;"So again I don't think that"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"You know if these guys met in person"
01:36:05;01:36:07;"I don't think he's like Steve Miller level"
01:36:07;01:36:08;"No"
01:36:08;01:36:09;"Treachery far from it"
01:36:09;01:36:11;"It seems like he's like caught up in the moment"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"He's in front of a small audience"
01:36:13;01:36:16;"He kind of let it get away from him a little bit"
01:36:16;01:36:17;"In fact I would say that"
01:36:17;01:36:20;"If he did hear us doing a close read"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"Of two throw away statements he made"
01:36:22;01:36:23;"He could say who cares to us"
01:36:23;01:36:24;"And that'd be fine"
01:36:24;01:36:25;"That'd be fine"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"I'd be absolutely fine with that"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"Let's just get to the end of it"
01:36:28;01:36:30;"Didn't want to deal with reality"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"We have to deal with reality now"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"So I seen that guy from Imagine Dragons"
01:36:34;01:36:35;"Get up on stage the other week"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"At Bellboard Music Awards"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Started talking about like conversion therapy"
01:36:39;01:36:40;"And saying how it was bullshit"
01:36:40;01:36:41;"And we needed to stop it"
01:36:41;01:36:42;"And I thought there you go"
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Good"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Use your platform"
01:36:44;01:36:45;"I'm not going to slag you off for that"
01:36:45;01:36:46;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"Well he probably did it because of you"
01:36:48;01:36:49;"No"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"That's brutal"
01:36:51;01:36:52;"Not at all"
01:36:52;01:36:53;"That part's brutal"
01:36:53;01:36:54;"Wait what does he say to that?"
01:36:54;01:36:55;"Good"
01:36:55;01:36:56;"Good for him"
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Good for everybody"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"Again I didn't know that much about Imagine Dragons"
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Until we started doing the show"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"But I feel like"
01:37:03;01:37:04;"I don't know if we ever talked about it"
01:37:04;01:37:05;"But you know"
01:37:05;01:37:06;"I feel like we've talked about it"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"We do so much research for this show"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"Oh the preparation that goes into the show"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Is enormous"
01:37:11;01:37:12;"It's unbelievable"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"Hours in the library"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"And I remember we kept coming"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"This is old at this point"
01:37:15;01:37:16;"That first of all"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"Imagine Dragons"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Come from the Mormon community"
01:37:20;01:37:22;"Which famously like many religious communities"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"Has been very harsh"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"And unfair towards"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Gay people"
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Among others"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"And you know including brutal"
01:37:30;01:37:31;"Inhumane"
01:37:31;01:37:32;"Idiotic stuff like"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"Conversion therapy"
01:37:34;01:37:35;"Trying to you know"
01:37:35;01:37:37;"Make somebody straight"
01:37:37;01:37:38;"Who's not"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"So anyway"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"The dude from Imagine Dragons"
01:37:41;01:37:43;"He like made a documentary about it"
01:37:43;01:37:44;"This is"
01:37:44;01:37:45;"The idea that he just got on stage"
01:37:45;01:37:47;"At the Billboard Awards"
01:37:47;01:37:48;"And suddenly"
01:37:48;01:37:49;"Like cause you know"
01:37:49;01:37:50;"There are musicians like that"
01:37:50;01:37:51;"Who will just like"
01:37:51;01:37:52;"Out of nowhere"
01:37:52;01:37:54;"Who weren't political for a second"
01:37:54;01:37:55;"See the right moment"
01:37:55;01:37:56;"And be like oh hey"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"You know"
01:37:57;01:37:58;"Global warming man"
01:37:58;01:37:59;"That's messed up"
01:37:59;01:38:00;"Right and look"
01:38:00;01:38:01;"It's not like every moment"
01:38:01;01:38:02;"Of being a musician"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"You need to like fly a flag"
01:38:03;01:38:04;"For what you believe in"
01:38:04;01:38:06;"Sometimes you need to just worry about like"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Major sevenths"
01:38:07;01:38:08;"And you know"
01:38:08;01:38:09;"Things like that"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"Get into the show on time"
01:38:10;01:38:11;"Falling too fast"
01:38:11;01:38:12;"To prepare for this"
01:38:12;01:38:13;"Tripping in the world"
01:38:13;01:38:14;"Could be dangerous"
01:38:14;01:38:15;"Everybody circling"
01:38:15;01:38:16;"As vultures"
01:38:16;01:38:17;"Negative nepotist"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"Everybody waiting"
01:38:18;01:38:19;"For the fall of man"
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Everybody praying"
01:38:20;01:38:21;"For the end of times"
01:38:21;01:38:22;"Everybody hoping"
01:38:22;01:38:23;"They could be the one"
01:38:23;01:38:24;"I was born to run"
01:38:24;01:38:25;"I was born for this"
01:38:25;01:38:26;"Whip whip"
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Run me like a race horse"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"Pull me like a rip cord"
01:38:29;01:38:31;"Break me down and build me up"
01:38:31;01:38:33;"I wanna be the slip slip"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"Word up on your lip lip"
01:38:35;01:38:37;"Red a bit you rip rip"
01:38:37;01:38:38;"Break me down and build me up"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"Whatever it takes"
01:38:40;01:38:45;"Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"I'll do whatever it takes"
01:38:47;01:38:52;"Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains"
01:38:52;01:38:54;"Whatever it takes"
01:38:54;01:39:01;"You take me to the top I'm ready for whatever it takes"
01:39:01;01:39:06;"Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins"
01:39:06;01:39:08;"I'll do whatever it takes"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"So I guess here's what's going on"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"These people aren't really talking to each other"
01:39:12;01:39:13;"That's what's happening"
01:39:13;01:39:16;"This guy from 1975 doesn't really know anything about Imagine Dragons"
01:39:16;01:39:17;"The truth is"
01:39:17;01:39:19;"Imagine Dragons are his straw man"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"They represent emptiness"
01:39:20;01:39:23;"Just like there's some assh*le on the internet right now"
01:39:23;01:39:26;"Who's saying the 1975 are pretentious and don't mean anything"
01:39:26;01:39:29;"Cause you can find somebody saying that about literally every band that exists"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"So the truth is"
01:39:31;01:39:34;"He happened to like be watching the Billboard Awards"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"And saw the guy say something and he was like"
01:39:36;01:39:37;"Finally"
01:39:37;01:39:40;"As if he'd been monitoring his career for the past six years"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"Where as the truth is this guy made a documentary"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"For like mainstream television"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"About the plight that an oppressed group"
01:39:47;01:39:50;"Faces within his large religious community"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"And again I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"Cause he does seem like a thoughtful sensitive person"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"I'd imagine if the guy from 1975"
01:39:57;01:39:58;"If we told him that"
01:39:58;01:39:59;"I think he'd probably be like"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"Oh damn I didn't know that"
01:40:01;01:40:02;"I do think this interviewer who says"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"It's probably because of you"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"Like imagine that you're from Imagine Dragons"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"And you're just like watching this"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"You're probably like"
01:40:09;01:40:11;"What is happening?"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"Probably because of you"
01:40:13;01:40:14;"Good"
01:40:14;01:40:15;"Finally"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"And then I also just think like"
01:40:17;01:40:18;"I think these things get under my skin"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Because I can relate to every side of it"
01:40:20;01:40:23;"And I've been in my own small little versions of this"
01:40:23;01:40:26;"And I know the feelings on both sides I think"
01:40:26;01:40:27;"To some extent"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Or whatever it's just triggering for me"
01:40:29;01:40:30;"Maybe you know like"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"A ween fish conversation for Jake"
01:40:32;01:40:33;"Highly triggering"
01:40:33;01:40:34;"So I don't know"
01:40:34;01:40:36;"I mean yeah there's just something about this that"
01:40:36;01:40:37;"That did kind of"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"Yeah man you know"
01:40:38;01:40:39;"You are man"
01:40:39;01:40:42;"We just unpacked that for the last like 45 minutes"
01:40:42;01:40:45;"I just feel bad for the guy from Imagine Dragons"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"Yeah"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"It's just also like people always go after the same stuff"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"That's what's lame about it"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Anyways"
01:40:51;01:40:52;"Shout out to those guys"
01:40:52;01:40:53;"I hope they work out their beef"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"The final thing I'll say is"
01:40:54;01:40:57;"They're just missing a lot of information about each other"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"I want to see them unite"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"And campaign for Bernie together"
01:41:01;01:41:02;"TC Town Hall"
01:41:02;01:41:03;"Anyway"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Hope that resolves itself"
01:41:05;01:41:07;"In a timely manner"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Let's get into the top 5"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"So you know"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"This is our first show back in a while"
01:41:20;01:41:21;"We're just gonna go"
01:41:21;01:41:22;"A little rusty"
01:41:22;01:41:23;"We're a little rusty"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"So we're just gonna go through"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"The top 5 songs on iTunes right now"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"By the way I heard that iTunes is not long for this earth"
01:41:29;01:41:30;"Is that true Seinfeld?"
01:41:30;01:41:32;"Does that mean the end of Time Crisis?"
01:41:32;01:41:33;"Yeah"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"This is our last episode"
01:41:34;01:41:36;"I feel like TC is on iTunes right?"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"Oh yeah and Reno forgot to mention"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Yeah this is the last Time Crisis"
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Oh sorry guys"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Didn't make it to 100 Eps"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"Just came up short"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"If we made it to 100 Eps"
01:41:43;01:41:46;"We would have gotten that syndication money too"
01:41:46;01:41:47;"That Seinfeld money"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"Too bad we did that rerun last week"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"That really screwed us"
01:41:52;01:41:54;"If we hadn't done that rerun"
01:41:54;01:41:57;"We would be splitting a billion dollars"
01:41:57;01:41:58;"Right now"
01:41:58;01:42:01;"Apple Music is replacing iTunes after 18 years"
01:42:01;01:42:03;"Wait Jake you know we're not on iTunes"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"We're on Apple Music"
01:42:05;01:42:06;"We're on Beats 1"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"But I thought you get to Apple Music"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"By going to iTunes"
01:42:09;01:42:10;"Right?"
01:42:10;01:42:11;"Like don't you like"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"Open your phone"

01:42:15;01:42:16;"There's like the iTunes"
01:42:16;01:42:18;"No it's two different things"
01:42:18;01:42:19;"I've listened to the show"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"I go to the iTunes thing"
01:42:22;01:42:23;"You go to"
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Where like I would like"
01:42:24;01:42:25;"No no that's not iTunes"
01:42:25;01:42:26;"That's Apple Music"
01:42:26;01:42:28;"The iTunes store is a different app"
01:42:28;01:42:29;"No but you"
01:42:29;01:42:31;"You can access"

01:42:35;01:42:36;"Like"
01:42:36;01:42:37;"They're probably linked"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"I have my iPhone"
01:42:38;01:42:39;"I'm willing to"
01:42:39;01:42:41;"There's like the little logo"
01:42:41;01:42:42;"With the musical note"
01:42:42;01:42:43;"Yeah the app"
01:42:43;01:42:44;"It's an app"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"And you open it"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"And then there's like"
01:42:46;01:42:47;"That's like"
01:42:47;01:42:48;"That's Apple Music"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"And it's like search"

01:42:56;01:42:57;"Ooh that's a catchy name"
01:42:57;01:42:58;"Catalina?"
01:42:58;01:42:59;"Catalina"
01:42:59;01:43:00;"I like Catalina Island"
01:43:00;01:43:01;"Very classy"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"Anyway we're just gonna go through the top five right now"
01:43:03;01:43:04;"Cause we're out of practice"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"We're not gonna compare it to anything"
01:43:05;01:43:06;"We're out of time"
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Number five"
01:43:07;01:43:08;"Our old friends the Chainsmokers"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"Back in"

01:43:17;01:43:19;"It's the fifth single"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"You're hot for Takeaway"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"From the Chainsmokers"

01:43:29;01:43:30;"That's kinda like"
01:43:30;01:43:32;"That's kinda like the pop move"
01:43:32;01:43:35;"Seinfeld's keeping a close eye on Bebe Rex's career"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"Hey hey hey"

01:43:54;01:43:56;"Well I mean this is just"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"Empty"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"Meaningless"
01:43:58;01:43:59;"About nothing"
01:43:59;01:44:01;"Heard a lot of people talking about Imagine Dragons"
01:44:01;01:44:03;"But nobody wants to take a shot at the Chainsmokers"
01:44:03;01:44:04;"Interesting"

01:44:22;01:44:26;"Hot for Takeaway"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"Kind of a ballad"
01:44:28;01:44:29;"Yeah"
01:44:29;01:44:31;"I'm waiting for that big harsh drop"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"That drop yeah"
01:44:32;01:44:35;"Seems like they were leading up to it"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"On that kinda brushed snare"
01:44:37;01:44:38;"Yeah right this part"
01:44:38;01:44:41;"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah"
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Hot for Takeaway"

01:44:55;01:44:56;"Hot for Takeaway"
01:44:56;01:44:57;"Kinda trippy"
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Yeah I mean one thing I gotta say"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Is if you played this to somebody"
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Like 30 years ago"
01:45:01;01:45:02;"They'd be like"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"This is the most futuristic"
01:45:03;01:45:04;"Hmm"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Experimental music I've ever heard"
01:45:06;01:45:07;"All about perspective man"
01:45:07;01:45:09;"Wouldn't they in like 1989"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"I think they'd be blown away by"
01:45:11;01:45:12;"By elements of it"
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Yeah"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"Cause even if you were listening"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"In 79"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"Yes"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"In 79 their head would literally explode"
01:45:18;01:45:19;"89 I'm not"
01:45:19;01:45:21;"80 but yeah 89 they would've"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"Be familiar with like Acid House"
01:45:23;01:45:25;"And also in like 89 like"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"They thought by like 2019"
01:45:27;01:45:29;"There'd be like flying cars and stuff"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Yeah that part's kinda weird"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Ricky you could kill somebody with that song"
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Anytime before 1960"
01:45:35;01:45:37;"You could kill somebody with that"
01:45:37;01:45:38;"Take it back"
01:45:38;01:45:39;"In a time machine you mean"
01:45:39;01:45:40;"Well that's a good plot point"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"For like a Back to the Future 5"
01:45:42;01:45:43;"Oh yeah"
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Marty you can't play the Chainsmokers"
01:45:45;01:45:47;"Your parents aren't ready for this"
01:45:47;01:45:50;"But your kids are gonna love it"
01:45:50;01:45:51;"Yeah Marty McFly just"
01:45:51;01:45:53;"Marty McFly goes back"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"But he doesn't know how to play guitar"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"He like sits in with the band"
01:45:57;01:45:58;"He's just like"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Uh where can I plug my CDJs in"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"You guys got an aux in"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Yeah it takes like 30 minutes"
01:46:04;01:46:05;"Of just like awkwardly"
01:46:05;01:46:07;"Trying to like rig it into the amp"
01:46:07;01:46:08;"Play some Chainsmokers"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"Marty no"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"The number 4 song"
01:46:11;01:46:13;"Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Senorita"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"Familiar faces"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"Senorita?"
01:46:18;01:46:19;"Shout out to Shawn Mendes"
01:46:19;01:46:20;"You know he came to the"
01:46:20;01:46:21;"Vampire Webster Hall show"

01:46:23;01:46:24;"Tight"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"I really liked him"
01:46:25;01:46:26;"I wouldn't recognize him"
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Oh yeah I've heard this song"
01:46:33;01:46:34;"Na na na"
01:46:34;01:46:41;"I love it when you call me"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"Senorita"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"Always I could pretend"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"I didn't need ya"
01:46:47;01:46:50;"But every touch is ooh la la la"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"It's true la la la"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Oh I should be running"
01:46:54;01:46:57;"Oh you keep me coming for ya"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"Late in Miami"
01:46:59;01:47:01;"The air was hot from summer"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Rain sweat dripping off me"
01:47:03;01:47:06;"Before I even knew her name"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"La la la"
01:47:08;01:47:11;"You felt like ooh la la la"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"Chase Full"
01:47:13;01:47:16;"Sapphire and moonlight"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"We danced for hours in the"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"San Tequila sunrise"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"Her body felt like ice"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"La la la"
01:47:23;01:47:24;"Is that what he said?"
01:47:24;01:47:25;"Wait what did he actually say?"
01:47:25;01:47:26;"I think he said like a place"
01:47:26;01:47:29;"Sapphire and moonlight"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"We danced for hours in the"
01:47:31;01:47:33;"San Tequila sunrise"
01:47:33;01:47:34;"San Tequila?"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"Or he said this ain't Tequila sunrise?"
01:47:36;01:47:37;"I think he said sapphire"
01:47:37;01:47:39;"Sapphire and moonlight"
01:47:39;01:47:41;"Wait is sapphire a type of gin?"
01:47:41;01:47:42;"Oh okay"
01:47:42;01:47:43;"He's saying they're drinking"
01:47:43;01:47:44;"He's like oh you"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"Gin and moonlight"
01:47:45;01:47:47;"You think we're in a Spanish speaking country"
01:47:47;01:47:49;"So you're assuming that we're drinking tequila"
01:47:49;01:47:51;"First of all we're not even in Mexico"
01:47:51;01:47:52;"Stupid"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"The line is we danced for hours in the sand"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"Next line Tequila sunrise"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"Wait but he said"
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Is it actually sapphire and moonlight?"
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Sapphire and moonlight"
01:48:01;01:48:02;"Wait yeah say the whole thing"
01:48:02;01:48:03;"Starting there"
01:48:03;01:48:04;"Sapphire and moonlight"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"We danced for hours in the sand"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"Tequila sunrise"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Oh he didn't say it ain't Tequila sunrise?"
01:48:10;01:48:11;"Oh okay so he's"
01:48:11;01:48:12;"Yeah"
01:48:12;01:48:13;"Wait sapphire is gin?"
01:48:13;01:48:14;"Bombay sapphire"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"But I don't think it's an alcohol reference"
01:48:16;01:48:17;"It's a double entendre"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"Maybe just the gemstone"
01:48:19;01:48:20;"No no you're saying me and"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Kabila Kabay are getting f***ed up"
01:48:22;01:48:23;"Yeah we're partying"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"We're getting loaded"
01:48:24;01:48:25;"We're drinking gin"
01:48:25;01:48:27;"Maybe martinis or something"
01:48:27;01:48:28;"G&Ts"
01:48:28;01:48:29;"And we're dancing on the sand"
01:48:29;01:48:31;"I know s*** the sun's coming out"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"Pasa de tequila"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"Yeah"
01:48:33;01:48:34;"And then six hours later"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Tequila moon"
01:48:36;01:48:37;"Oh"
01:48:37;01:48:38;"Okay wait wait yeah"
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Sapphire moonlight"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"Tequila sunrise"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"Yeah he's saying"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"He's saying in the moonlight"
01:48:44;01:48:45;"We drank gin"
01:48:45;01:48:46;"And then in the morning"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Actually I like the songwriting on this"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Wait is sapphire and moonlight a drink though?"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"No they're drinking gin"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"He's kind of taking out a few like words"
01:48:54;01:48:55;"That make it more clear"
01:48:55;01:48:56;"Yeah"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"They're drinking gin in the moonlight"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"Wait hold on"
01:48:59;01:49:00;"You might be right"
01:49:00;01:49:01;"Drinking gin in the moonlight"
01:49:01;01:49:02;"I feel like he's just"
01:49:02;01:49:03;"No sapphire moonlight"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"It's a Minecraft skin"
01:49:06;01:49:09;"Okay it's like Minecraft all night"
01:49:09;01:49:10;"And then as the sun came up"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Stone cold sober"
01:49:12;01:49:13;"You wanna drink?"
01:49:13;01:49:15;"It's a Wynne-amp skin"
01:49:15;01:49:17;"Or of course he could literally just be describing"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"The color of the moonlight"
01:49:19;01:49:20;"That's what I'm thinking"
01:49:20;01:49:21;"Wait cause sapphire is blue right?"
01:49:21;01:49:25;"There's a tequila sunrise flavor of Red Bull now so"
01:49:25;01:49:26;"Is there?"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"No they're drinking that at dawn"
01:49:28;01:49:29;"Right"
01:49:29;01:49:31;"Wow we're really overthinking this"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"I think sapphire is blue"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"And moonlight is famously blue"
01:49:35;01:49:36;"Yeah"
01:49:36;01:49:37;"Bluish"
01:49:37;01:49:38;"Okay here's what I think"
01:49:38;01:49:39;"He's"
01:49:39;01:49:40;"Tequila sunrise is a drink"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"He's kind of reverse engineering it"
01:49:42;01:49:45;"So sapphire moonlight is not a drink"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"But he's using tequila sunrise as like the"
01:49:47;01:49:50;"Template to go back and describe the moonlight"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"Sean I'm sorry we really bungled this one"
01:49:53;01:49:54;"You know"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Is it an Eagles reference?"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Well yeah"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"Or is it just a drink reference?"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I think everybody knows the phrase tequila sunrise"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"But a lot of people don't realize it's an Eagles song"
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Is it a Mountain Brews reference?"
01:50:06;01:50:07;"It might be a Mountain"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"The timing works out"
01:50:08;01:50:09;"And also so he said"
01:50:09;01:50:10;"Land in Miami"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"The air was hot from summer rain"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Sweat dripping off me before I even knew her name"
01:50:14;01:50:15;"La la la"
01:50:15;01:50:16;"It felt like ooh la la la"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"Yeah no"
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Sapphire moonlight"
01:50:19;01:50:20;"We danced for hours in the sand"
01:50:20;01:50:21;"Tequila sunrise"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"Her body fit right in my hands"
01:50:22;01:50:23;"La la la"
01:50:23;01:50:25;"It's got a little bit of an Ed Sheeran vibe to the song"
01:50:25;01:50:27;"Oh man there's an Ed Sheeran song I wanted to play"
01:50:27;01:50:29;"Remind me on the next episode"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"We gotta do a deep dive"
01:50:30;01:50:32;"And I'll actually give this a heads up to the listeners"
01:50:32;01:50:33;"The next time"
01:50:33;01:50:34;"Maybe not the next episode"
01:50:34;01:50:35;"Sometime soon"
01:50:35;01:50:37;"I was listening to classic rock radio"
01:50:37;01:50:38;"Nice"
01:50:38;01:50:39;"In an Uber"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"And in between literally I think Steve Miller and like"
01:50:41;01:50:42;"Heart"
01:50:42;01:50:45;"They played a new Ed Sheeran song featuring Bruno Mars"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"And Chris Stapleton that's like a hard rock song"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"Really?"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"Wow"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"Yeah we gotta get into that"
01:50:50;01:50:51;"I think I gotta play this real quick"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"Just check this out"
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Yeah"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Sorry Sean"
01:50:54;01:50:55;"Sorry Sean and Camilla"
01:50:55;01:50:56;"I actually like that song"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"We'll get into it again"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"This is a song from the new Ed Sheeran album called Blow"
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Unfortunately it is not in the top 5"
01:51:01;01:51:02;"Called Blow?"
01:51:02;01:51:03;"Yeah"
01:51:03;01:51:06;"Just imagine if this like Beavis and Butt-head"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"Just like"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"Yeah Blow is right"
01:51:09;01:51:13;"That is such a hilarious album title"
01:51:13;01:51:16;"I love that they just dropped this on the classic rock station"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"Oh my god"
01:51:18;01:51:20;"It's kind of Rage Against the Machine vibe"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"He's taking a page out of Greta Van Fleet's book here"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"Oh yeah"
01:51:24;01:51:28;"I'm feeling like a bullet"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Jumping out a gun"
01:51:30;01:51:33;"I'm feeling like a winner"
01:51:33;01:51:36;"I feel like the one"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"You're doing something to me"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"This is just like White Snake"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"I'm feeling like a bullet"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"Jumping out a gun"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"You're doing something to me"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"This is just like White Snake"
01:51:46;01:51:48;"You're doing something strange"
01:51:48;01:51:51;"Well jump back, talk to me woman"
01:51:51;01:51:54;"You make me wanna make a baby, baby"
01:51:54;01:51:55;"You make"
01:51:55;01:51:57;"This feels like"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"Is this 1983?"
01:51:58;01:51:59;"Feels like a misstep"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"No this is 90's vibe"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"It's like a little bit Lenny Kravitz almost"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"Oh good call"
01:52:05;01:52:09;"Chris Stapleton"
01:52:09;01:52:11;"God these guys suck"
01:52:12;01:52:15;"I wasn't imagining Dragons any day of the week"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"Check that out"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"Bruno Mars is on this?"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"Yeah, it's all three of them"
01:52:22;01:52:36;"Shoot my shot tonight"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Jesus, dirty"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"I'm dying for you"
01:52:40;01:52:44;"Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind"
01:52:44;01:52:50;"This is unbelievable"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Not feeling it?"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"Oh my god"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"Come on man"
01:52:55;01:52:57;"You know what man"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"No man I'm not feeling it"
01:52:59;01:53:00;"I'm not feeling it"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"Did we already hear Bruno?"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Can we hear him?"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"I think Bruno sang a little bit"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"He was in those like bluesy harmonies"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Oh was he? Okay"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"Keep it going, let's just take this all the way"
01:53:09;01:53:10;"No but Jake I gotta say man"
01:53:10;01:53:12;"I'm tired of people like you"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Complaining that rock's played out"
01:53:14;01:53:17;"And then you get three major stars bringing rock back"
01:53:17;01:53:19;"And you turn your nose up at it man"
01:53:19;01:53:20;"Come on"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"Hell yeah I do"
01:53:21;01:53:23;"These lyrics are incredible"
01:53:23;01:53:25;"Oh there he is"
01:53:25;01:53:29;"I kinda like that part"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Yeah that part's nice"
01:53:30;01:53:35;"Whipped cream and everything"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"I'm coming for you"
01:53:37;01:53:41;"Rock, rolling"
01:53:41;01:53:44;"Shoot my shot tonight"
01:53:44;01:53:47;"I'm coming baby"
01:53:47;01:53:49;"I'm coming for you"
01:53:49;01:53:53;"Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind"
01:53:53;01:53:54;"I'm coming baby"
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Oh"
01:53:55;01:54:00;"Will Stapleton?"
01:54:00;01:54:01;"He shreds"
01:54:01;01:54:02;"Probably"
01:54:02;01:54:03;"Yeah"
01:54:03;01:54:11;"Oh you got the octave pedal on"
01:54:11;01:54:12;"I'm kinda into that"
01:54:12;01:54:13;"That's kinda cool"
01:54:13;01:54:17;"I'm coming baby"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"I'm coming for you"
01:54:19;01:54:21;"Yeah yeah"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"Rock, rolling"
01:54:23;01:54:26;"Shoot my shot tonight"
01:54:26;01:54:29;"I'm coming baby"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"I'm coming for you"
01:54:31;01:54:35;"Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Jesus"
01:54:36;01:54:42;"It's kinda like Aerosmith"
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Like 70's Aerosmith kinda vibe"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"I think you're Lenny Kravitz"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Yeah I think Kravitz is totally on point"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"I like things about it"
01:54:50;01:54:51;"But I gotta say"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"Again to go back to Imagine Dragons"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Talk about rough stuff man"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"Even if you think Imagine Dragons are rough stuff"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"You can't deny that they're fundamentally progressive"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Oh yeah they have like an original sound"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"They're not backwards looking at all"
01:55:04;01:55:07;"Yeah which is why they're not on classic rock radio"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"Yeah"
01:55:09;01:55:12;"And why this drivel was"
01:55:12;01:55:15;"Let me blow your mind"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"That is brutal"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"Vampire weekend cover"
01:55:19;01:55:20;"Oh my god"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"Pull my trigger"
01:55:21;01:55:23;"Did we ever talk about that movie yesterday"
01:55:23;01:55:27;"And Ed Sheeran thing doing the hey dude line"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"We got an email about it right?"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"Yeah it came up a lot on Twitter"
01:55:30;01:55:31;"Hey dude"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"I feel like we never addressed it on the show"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"Have you seen any movie?"
01:55:34;01:55:35;"No"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"This is the movie about a world where"
01:55:37;01:55:40;"The Beatles didn't exist and one guy remembers them"
01:55:40;01:55:41;"Right"
01:55:41;01:55:44;"Which people I think all the good jokes about have already been made"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"So I think we can"
01:55:45;01:55:48;"I'll see that movie at some point in my life"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"The number three song right now"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"I actually was just introduced to this song"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"Jake I bet you haven't heard this one yet"
01:55:54;01:55:57;"But Old Town Road is not the only hip hop country hybrid"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"Racing up the charts"
01:55:59;01:56:01;"There's one hot on its heels"
01:56:01;01:56:03;"And this is the Get Up by Blanco Brown"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"Who's also from Atlanta"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"But he would spend his summers with his grandmother in Butler, Georgia"
01:56:07;01:56:09;"Where he learned to appreciate country music"
01:56:09;01:56:12;"Right now"
01:56:12;01:56:15;"I just need you to get real loose"
01:56:15;01:56:18;"It says he actually played the lap steel himself"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"Tight"
01:56:19;01:56:21;"Grab your loved ones"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"Or grab your love partner"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"And if you're by yourself no worries"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"Just follow after me"
01:56:28;01:56:31;"I wanna do the two step in cowboy boogie"
01:56:31;01:56:34;"With your sweetheart and spin out with you to hold down"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"This song rules"
01:56:36;01:56:39;"I'm more into this than Old Town"
01:56:39;01:56:42;"And dip with it, gon' throw down"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"Take a sip with it, I'll lean back"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"Put your hips in it"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Let's have some fun"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"To the left, to the left now"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"To the right, to the right"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"Can this song exist without Old Town you think?"
01:56:54;01:56:57;"To the pain, put it on your side"
01:56:57;01:57:00;"Gon' roll your shoulders"
01:57:00;01:57:03;"Do the slip and slide"
01:57:03;01:57:07;"This next part's my favorite part of this time of shot"
01:57:07;01:57:10;"Gon' do the two step in cowboy boogie"
01:57:10;01:57:13;"Grab your sweetheart and spin out with you to hold down"
01:57:13;01:57:15;"This song rules"
01:57:15;01:57:17;"I never played the lap steel before"
01:57:17;01:57:19;"So it sounded horrible, as we can imagine"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"And I tuned it like I tuned my guitar over E"
01:57:21;01:57:23;"And made one chord bar fret"
01:57:23;01:57:25;"And then I kinda made the loop"
01:57:25;01:57:28;"And then I added the beatboxing, the kick drums, the 808s"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"The snares, the spoons, the tambourines"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"And after I got finished doing that, I was like"
01:57:32;01:57:34;"This song is so joyful, I just gotta make some lyrics"
01:57:34;01:57:36;"Feel just as exciting"
01:57:36;01:57:38;"When I picture this dude making this song by himself"
01:57:38;01:57:40;"I love it"
01:57:40;01:57:43;"Lo-fi auto-tune country"
01:57:43;01:57:46;"And take to the floor"
01:57:46;01:57:49;"Gon' do the two step in cowboy boogie"
01:57:49;01:57:53;"Grab your sweetheart and spin out with you to hold down"
01:57:53;01:57:55;"And get into it"
01:57:55;01:57:58;"Take it to the left now and dip"
01:57:58;01:58:01;"The truth is, ""Old Town Road"" is a great song"
01:58:01;01:58:03;"But there were a lot of kinda like"
01:58:03;01:58:05;"Trap, country, hip-hop hybrids"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"Floating around in the years before it"
01:58:07;01:58:09;"So it did kinda seem like"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"Like remember the, there's that Big Wett song"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"That was in the Hardee's commercial?"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"Right, right"
01:58:14;01:58:15;"Turn up on the weekends"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Oh yeah, that song was sick"
01:58:16;01:58:18;"And then I feel like Young Thug made like"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"Some kinda country songs"
01:58:19;01:58:20;"So it was like bubbling"
01:58:20;01:58:22;"And ""Old Town Road"" was like the slam dunk"
01:58:22;01:58:23;"Right song, right moment"
01:58:23;01:58:25;"So of course ""Old Town Road"" is a very important song"
01:58:25;01:58:28;"But it didn't, maybe it kicked off the successful era"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"Of that type of music"
01:58:29;01:58:31;"But in another way it was also kinda like"
01:58:31;01:58:32;"The crest of the wave"
01:58:32;01:58:34;"The next song, number two"
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Lizzo, ""Truth Hurts"""
01:58:36;01:58:45;"Wild men great so they gotta be great"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"I just took a DNA test"
01:58:49;01:58:51;"Turns out I'm a hundred percent"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"Damn, if G even win I'm crying crazy"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"Yeah I got boy problems"
01:58:55;01:58:56;"That's a human in me"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"Bling bling, then I solve 'em"
01:58:58;01:58:59;"That's the goddess in me"
01:58:59;01:59:01;"You coulda had a bad bitch then"
01:59:01;01:59:02;"Not committal"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"Help you with your career"
01:59:04;01:59:05;"Just a little"
01:59:05;01:59:07;"You both could hold me down"
01:59:07;01:59:08;"But you're holding me back"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"And that's the sound"
01:59:10;01:59:11;"Of me not calling you back"
01:59:11;01:59:12;"This is a really big song"
01:59:12;01:59:13;"I've heard this"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"Wild men great so they gotta be great"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"Don't text me"
01:59:17;01:59:18;"Tell it straight to my face"
01:59:18;01:59:19;"Best friends"
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Let me down in the salon chair"
01:59:21;01:59:22;"Shampoo press"
01:59:22;01:59:24;"Get you out of my hair"
01:59:24;01:59:27;"Fresh photos with the bar lighting"
01:59:27;01:59:30;"New man on the Minnesota Vikings"
01:59:30;01:59:31;"Truth hurts me"
01:59:31;01:59:34;"The radio station WIXX in Green Bay"
01:59:34;01:59:38;"Edited out the ""New man on the Minnesota Vikings"" line"
01:59:38;01:59:41;"Due to the Green Bay Packers rivalry with the Vikings"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Is she a Minnesota based artist?"
01:59:43;01:59:46;"I think she's from Texas"
01:59:46;01:59:47;"That sounds cool"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"I'll be your side chick"
01:59:48;01:59:50;"I put the stiiiick in single"
01:59:50;01:59:53;"Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger"
01:59:53;01:59:55;"So you can tell your friend"
01:59:55;01:59:57;"Shoot your shot when you see 'em"
01:59:57;02:00:01;"It's okay, he already in my DM"
02:00:01;02:00:03;"Got a witty line in there"
02:00:03;02:00:08;"The song's popularity was also boosted by its appearance in the Netflix film ""Someone Great"""
02:00:08;02:00:10;"Wait, Seinfeld, do a number crunch"
02:00:10;02:00:13;"Is there a Vampire Weekend song in the Netflix film ""Someone Great""?"
02:00:13;02:00:16;"Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"Let's get a number crunch"
02:00:18;02:00:21;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000"
02:00:21;02:00:22;"You don't know?"
02:00:22;02:00:24;"I'd remember if I wrote a song for something"
02:00:24;02:00:27;"But it sounds familiar, like they wanted to use an old song"
02:00:27;02:00:33;"Okay, uh, so there's a scene where they reminisced Vampire Weekend"
02:00:33;02:00:36;"Oh yeah, Mansard Roof"
02:00:36;02:00:37;"Okay, that sounds right, knew it"
02:00:37;02:00:40;"Well how come Mansard Roof didn't shoot back up in the charts?"
02:00:40;02:00:44;"Hey by the way, we got a lot of tweets about this life being in Love Island"
02:00:44;02:00:45;"Oh yeah"
02:00:45;02:00:48;"What's up with that? A lot of people are very curious"
02:00:48;02:00:52;"And Harmony Hall in a Comfort Hotels ad"
02:00:52;02:00:53;"That's right"
02:00:53;02:00:54;"Oh whoa"
02:00:54;02:00:55;"It's just instrumental"
02:00:55;02:00:58;"It's like some scene where like goats are running around or something like that"
02:00:58;02:01:04;"Okay, so the thing is with Love Island, I'm 99% sure that I didn't approve that"
02:01:04;02:01:08;"And look, I'm pretty easy going with approvals unless it's like a really harsh thing"
02:01:08;02:01:10;"Especially for TV and movies"
02:01:10;02:01:15;"Obviously when it's like a company, you gotta kinda like make sure the company's not like brutal"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"But TV and movies, it's like you know, for instance"
02:01:17;02:01:20;"They wanna use Mansard Roof in a Netflix movie called Someone Great"
02:01:20;02:01:23;"It's like, alright, sure, why not?"
02:01:23;02:01:27;"But in the UK, and also in the US a little bit"
02:01:27;02:01:30;"There's some of these TV shows, but especially the UK"
02:01:30;02:01:33;"They have these like blanket license deals"
02:01:33;02:01:35;"I don't know how to describe it"
02:01:35;02:01:38;"My understanding is that fair use laws are different"
02:01:38;02:01:44;"So in the UK, they're allowed to like briefly use whatever songs they want in shows"
02:01:44;02:01:46;"'Cause I kinda remember this happening a lot in the UK"
02:01:46;02:01:49;"People are like, oh my god, on BBC they just used"
02:01:49;02:01:51;"I might be totally wrong, I could like go look at my email"
02:01:51;02:01:53;"And probably be like, do you want this to be on Love Island?"
02:01:53;02:01:55;"I'm like, hell yeah! I don't totally remember"
02:01:55;02:01:58;"But I also feel like on MSNBC, people would always be like"
02:01:58;02:02:02;"Morning Joe just played a part of a Vampire Weekend song on their way out"
02:02:02;02:02:05;"And I was like, nobody asked about that 'cause they don't have to"
02:02:05;02:02:08;"So I could be wrong about this, you know"
02:02:08;02:02:12;"I got a lot going on with the internet radio show, the research, all that stuff"
02:02:12;02:02:14;"But a lot of times when I hear about stuff like that"
02:02:14;02:02:16;"I'm like, oh yeah, it's the blanket"
02:02:16;02:02:18;"It's the blanket agreement"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"Do you remember the MTV blanket agreement?"
02:02:20;02:02:21;"No, what was that?"
02:02:21;02:02:25;"So if you submitted your video to be on MTV"
02:02:25;02:02:27;"At the height of MTV"
02:02:27;02:02:31;"Then you were submitting it for a blanket license for all MTV shows"
02:02:31;02:02:33;"If you had your video or submitted it"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"They can use it on The Real World"
02:02:35;02:02:37;"They can use it on Jersey Shore"
02:02:37;02:02:39;"On Beavis and Butthead"
02:02:39;02:02:43;"Anything, like any B-show that they had"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"You're majority, wow"
02:02:45;02:02:48;"But the thing is, I think that turned into a bit of a pain in the ass for MTV"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"Because then in the DVD era"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"When people wanted to get a box set of like The Real World"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"Suddenly they're like, oh god, we have to go edit it"
02:02:54;02:02:57;"Because the license wouldn't cover DVDs"
02:02:57;02:02:58;"Like on Beavis"
02:02:58;02:03:00;"Yeah, exactly, I'm sure they didn't get"
02:03:00;02:03:02;"They used the blanket license"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"But the videos aren't on the re-"
02:03:04;02:03:06;"Oh yeah, you're right"
02:03:06;02:03:08;"On the DVDs they didn't have the rights to the videos"
02:03:08;02:03:10;"But that was most of the show"
02:03:10;02:03:12;"It was like half of it"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"It was the funniest part of the show"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"I'm sure there's probably some hilarious stuff"
02:03:16;02:03:20;"Like somebody being really frustrated after losing on road rules"
02:03:20;02:03:22;"And it's just like"
02:03:22;02:03:25;"Everything in its right place"
02:03:25;02:03:27;"You're just like, damn"
02:03:27;02:03:29;"Surprise Radiohead went for that one"
02:03:29;02:03:32;"It's like, no, no they didn't"
02:03:32;02:03:35;"Guess what the number one song is"
02:03:35;02:03:37;"On iTunes top five right now"
02:03:37;02:03:38;"Old Town Road"
02:03:38;02:03:39;"That's right"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"But it's the Billy Ray Cyrus remix"
02:03:41;02:03:45;"Which to me has kind of become like the de facto version"
02:03:45;02:03:46;"Right"
02:03:46;02:03:48;"Because there's the original, then this is the biggest remix"
02:03:48;02:03:49;"And you have all these other ones too"
02:03:49;02:03:55;"I feel like when we were recording the REM crossover EPS in April"
02:03:55;02:03:56;"Right"
02:03:56;02:03:58;"That's when this dropped and it was number one"
02:03:58;02:04:02;"Yeah, because I'm pretty sure we played this for Adam Scott and Scott Aukerman"
02:04:02;02:04:03;"For the first time ever"
02:04:03;02:04:05;"Yes, in April"
02:04:05;02:04:06;"Here we are, August"
02:04:06;02:04:08;"Well look, Lil Nas X, however you did it"
02:04:08;02:04:12;"I'm glad that Old Town Road and Lil Nas X took the crown"
02:04:12;02:04:14;"Even if they did it in a newfangled way"
02:04:14;02:04:15;"It's 2019"
02:04:15;02:04:17;"And I also like that he's opening up a real can of worms"
02:04:17;02:04:21;"For the future of cloning and award shows"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"He's also got a new song called Panini"
02:04:24;02:04:26;"That's pretty Vampire Weekend"
02:04:26;02:04:30;"My understanding is that in that song he's actually referencing a cartoon character called Panini"
02:04:30;02:04:43;"But when I met him I was just like, ""Yo, I like your new song Panini"""
02:04:43;02:04:46;"And I was kind of like, ""I feel like nobody talks about Paninis anymore"""
02:04:46;02:04:48;"And he was like, ""Yeah"""
02:04:48;02:04:50;"You didn't know it was about a cartoon character?"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"You thought it was about a vampire?"
02:04:52;02:04:54;"You thought it was about the sandwich?"
02:04:54;02:04:57;"I didn't know it was about a cartoon character yet"
02:05:21;02:05:23;"I mean, I think we talked about it"
02:05:23;02:05:25;"But you know who's really cleaning up on this?"
02:05:25;02:05:26;"Trent"
02:05:26;02:05:29;"Trent Reznor's got serious publishing on this song"
02:05:29;02:05:31;"It's built around a Nine Inch Nails sample"
02:05:31;02:05:32;"That's so funny"
02:05:32;02:05:34;"You're Trent Reznor, you're like"
02:05:34;02:05:36;"You know, he's doing film scoring"
02:05:36;02:05:38;"I'm sure he's got equity and all sorts of stuff"
02:05:38;02:05:40;"Seems like the type of dude who's probably like"
02:05:40;02:05:42;"He's an early investor in Uber"
02:05:42;02:05:43;"You know?"
02:05:43;02:05:45;"But he's like, definitely like loaded"
02:05:45;02:05:47;"But you can just imagine that just like"
02:05:47;02:05:49;"This is some truly out of nowhere s***"
02:05:49;02:05:52;"Hey Trent, here's an extra 7 million dollars for you"
02:05:52;02:05:53;"Cool"
02:05:53;02:05:54;"This quarter"
02:05:54;02:05:55;"Oh my god"
02:05:55;02:05:56;"Maybe more"
02:05:56;02:05:59;"I can't tell if that's a lot or a little for this song"
02:05:59;02:06:00;"I have no idea"
02:06:00;02:06:02;"Man, how come Trent hasn't jumped on a remix?"
02:06:02;02:06:04;"Oh, he's just watching the money roll in"
02:06:04;02:06:05;"Yeah, he doesn't need to"
02:06:05;02:06:07;"He can put whoever the f*** he want on and just keep those checks coming"
02:06:07;02:06:09;"You think Trent lives in LA?"
02:06:09;02:06:11;"I'm sure he has at least one abode"
02:06:11;02:06:13;"Didn't he like live in New Orleans for a while?"
02:06:13;02:06:14;"Or he just like record down there?"
02:06:14;02:06:15;"I don't know"
02:06:15;02:06:16;"What do you think Trent's gonna do"
02:06:16;02:06:18;"Just like an extra 12 million dollars this year?"
02:06:18;02:06:21;"God, that's a deep question"
02:06:21;02:06:22;"Christmas gifts"
02:06:22;02:06:24;"Gonna be crazy"
02:06:24;02:06:27;"He's one of the key people that went after Hootie and the Blowfish"
02:06:27;02:06:28;"Oh, Trent was?"
02:06:28;02:06:29;"What? At the time?"
02:06:29;02:06:30;"Oh no"
02:06:30;02:06:31;"More recently"
02:06:31;02:06:32;"Wait, recently?"
02:06:32;02:06:34;"He said death to Hootie and the Blowfish"
02:06:34;02:06:35;"Death?"
02:06:35;02:06:36;"What?"
02:06:36;02:06:37;"In 2019?"
02:06:37;02:06:38;"Chill out, Trent"
02:06:38;02:06:40;"Whoa, I thought Trent was a chill dude, man"
02:06:40;02:06:42;"Is he actually like the Steve Miller of"
02:06:42;02:06:44;"He said that, no, he said that in 1997"
02:06:44;02:06:47;"Wow, he had a really funny soul patch back in the day"
02:06:47;02:06:48;"Check that out"
02:06:48;02:06:49;"Oh my god"
02:06:49;02:06:51;"Alright, he hated Hootie"
02:06:51;02:06:52;"Well you know what, Trent?"
02:06:52;02:06:54;"You were happy to go open for Hootie in 95-"
02:06:54;02:06:55;"No, I'm just kidding"
02:06:55;02:06:59;"This would be like, we're talking about like the dude from 1975"
02:06:59;02:07:00;"Being like, guys, who cares?"
02:07:00;02:07:02;"Why are you obsessed with this beef?"
02:07:02;02:07:04;"Like we would like really reach out to Trent"
02:07:04;02:07:06;"Like, dude, come on man"
02:07:06;02:07:08;"Like there's still some like open wounds about like the Hootie thing"
02:07:08;02:07:10;"Just be like, guys, who the f*** cares?"
02:07:10;02:07:11;"You know, but I will say this"
02:07:11;02:07:12;"Wouldn't that be cool?"
02:07:12;02:07:13;"Trent's like, you know what?"
02:07:13;02:07:18;"I'm already a very wealthy musician, film composer, and tech investor"
02:07:18;02:07:21;"I made an extra 11 million dollars this year that"
02:07:21;02:07:24;"Honestly, if it wasn't for Lil Nas X, it just literally wouldn't have happened"
02:07:24;02:07:27;"I'm gonna give it to Hootie and the Blowfish"
02:07:27;02:07:30;"I've had this albatross around my neck"
02:07:30;02:07:32;"If there's someone that's in need"
02:07:32;02:07:33;"For 20 years"
02:07:33;02:07:34;"It's Darius Rucker"
02:07:34;02:07:36;"I'm gonna start the Hootie Foundation"
02:07:36;02:07:39;"He's saying some kind of like 1975 type stuff"
02:07:39;02:07:41;"This is from 1997"
02:07:41;02:07:42;"Rock and roll should be about rebellion"
02:07:42;02:07:43;"It should piss your parents off"
02:07:43;02:07:45;"And it should offer some elements of taboo"
02:07:45;02:07:47;"It should be dangerous, you know?"
02:07:47;02:07:49;"But I'm not sure it really is dangerous anymore"
02:07:49;02:07:50;"Now thanks to MTV and radio"
02:07:50;02:07:53;"Rock and roll gets pumped into your house every second of every day"
02:07:53;02:07:56;"Being a rock and roll star has become as legitimate a career option"
02:07:56;02:07:59;"As being an astronaut or a policeman or a fireman"
02:07:59;02:08:01;"That's why I applaud, even helped create"
02:08:01;02:08:03;"Bands like Marilyn Manson"
02:08:03;02:08:04;"The shock rock value"
02:08:04;02:08:05;"I think it's necessary"
02:08:05;02:08:07;"Death to Hootie and the Blowfish, you know?"
02:08:07;02:08:08;"It's safe"
02:08:08;02:08:09;"It's legitimate"
02:08:09;02:08:10;"Look at Marilyn Manson"
02:08:10;02:08:13;"They have no qualms about taking that whole thing on"
02:08:13;02:08:14;"The scene needs that, you know?"
02:08:14;02:08:17;"It doesn't need another Pearl Jam ripoff band"
02:08:17;02:08:19;"It doesn't need the politically correct REMs telling us"
02:08:19;02:08:21;"We don't eat meat"
02:08:21;02:08:23;"F*** you to all that"
02:08:23;02:08:25;"We want someone who wants to say"
02:08:25;02:08:27;"You know what? I'd s*** off 10 times a night"
02:08:27;02:08:28;"And I f*** groupies"
02:08:28;02:08:31;"Oh, this has got crazier and crazier"
02:08:31;02:08:33;"It's not considered safe"
02:08:33;02:08:36;"F*** off 10 times a night?"
02:08:36;02:08:38;"It's not considered safe to say that now"
02:08:38;02:08:39;"But Rock shouldn't be safe"
02:08:39;02:08:43;"I'm not saying I adhere wholeheartedly to all that in my own lifestyle"
02:08:43;02:08:45;"I only f*** off 5 times a day"
02:08:45;02:08:48;"But I think that's the aesthetic we need right now"
02:08:48;02:08:50;"There needs to be some element of anarchy"
02:08:50;02:08:52;"Or something that dares to be different"
02:08:52;02:08:54;"That's so classic"
02:08:54;02:08:56;"I guess the thing about all this s***"
02:08:56;02:08:57;"It's like, look"
02:08:57;02:09:00;"I guess part of music is getting riled up about"
02:09:00;02:09:02;"It is about the narcissism of small difference"
02:09:02;02:09:03;"And that you gotta like, actually"
02:09:03;02:09:05;"I gotta take a step back and be like"
02:09:05;02:09:07;"That's all music is, kind of"
02:09:07;02:09:09;"It's like, who cares how the drums sound?"
02:09:09;02:09:10;"It's the narcissism of small difference"
02:09:10;02:09:11;"That means something to you"
02:09:11;02:09:13;"Even though it really isn't that different"
02:09:13;02:09:15;"But there is something funny about"
02:09:15;02:09:18;"Most s*** talking just like, never ages well"
02:09:18;02:09:19;"Yeah, that's a good lesson, right?"
02:09:19;02:09:21;"Yeah, maybe above all"
02:09:21;02:09:22;"Because it's like, at the end of the day"
02:09:22;02:09:26;"It's like, is Marilyn Manson like, edgier than Hootie?"
02:09:26;02:09:27;"No"
02:09:27;02:09:28;"It definitely, yeah"
02:09:28;02:09:30;"This statement hasn't aged well"
02:09:30;02:09:32;"And also, just picture that you're like"
02:09:32;02:09:34;"Michael Stite"
02:09:34;02:09:36;"Just like, cracking open Rolling Stone in 1997"
02:09:36;02:09:39;"And you're just like, oh yeah, Trent Reznor"
02:09:39;02:09:40;"See, nice guy"
02:09:40;02:09:42;"And you're like, I met him a couple times"
02:09:42;02:09:43;"And he's just like"
02:09:43;02:09:44;"Hootie the blow s***"
02:09:44;02:09:46;"REM doesn't eat meat"
02:09:46;02:09:47;"Shut the f*** up"
02:09:47;02:09:48;"Why don't you d*** off more?"
02:09:48;02:09:50;"And you just be like, Jesus Christ"
02:09:50;02:09:52;"This guy's insane"
02:09:52;02:09:54;"Crush a burger and beat it, bro"
02:09:54;02:09:57;"And also like"
02:09:57;02:09:59;"At least Trent Reznor's not trying to like"
02:09:59;02:10:01;"Actually make it political"
02:10:01;02:10:02;"At least Trent Reznor's just being like"
02:10:02;02:10:03;"I like Marilyn Manson"
02:10:03;02:10:04;"Because they're just morons"
02:10:04;02:10:05;"Who d*** off a lot"
02:10:05;02:10:06;"They're just f***ing idiots"
02:10:06;02:10:09;"Just d*** off, that is so weird"
02:10:09;02:10:11;"What?"
02:10:11;02:10:18;"Okay, I think we really need a TC Town Hall with Trent"
02:10:18;02:10:20;"We got a full lineup, dude"
02:10:20;02:10:22;"We got Steve and Bob"
02:10:22;02:10:25;"We got Gene and Dean and Trey and the boys"
02:10:25;02:10:27;"Three generations of beef"
02:10:27;02:10:29;"We got Maddie and Danny"
02:10:29;02:10:31;"And now we got Trent, Hootie"
02:10:31;02:10:32;"And Stipe"
02:10:32;02:10:34;"And Stipe and Marilyn Manson"
02:10:34;02:10:36;"And Peter Buck"
02:10:38;02:10:39;"Trent, what do you have to say for yourself?"
02:10:39;02:10:42;"He's like, I'm sorry, but I might have been wrong"
02:10:42;02:10:44;"But in the 90s I just had this perception that"
02:10:44;02:10:46;"You guys were like, didn't eat meat"
02:10:46;02:10:47;"And you're like, well, we didn't eat meat"
02:10:47;02:10:49;"And you also didn't f*** off that much"
02:10:49;02:10:51;"Well, hold on, Trent"
02:10:51;02:10:52;"We d*** off a lot"
02:10:52;02:10:54;"Well, yeah, but not like ten times a night"
02:10:54;02:10:56;"You'd be surprised, man"
02:10:56;02:10:57;"That's about as good as it gets"
02:10:57;02:10:59;"That's a great note to end on"
02:10:59;02:11:01;"Also, it's like, I'm sure Michael Stipe probably"
02:11:01;02:11:03;"Hated Hootie and the Blowfish too, realistically"
02:11:03;02:11:05;"He probably thought they sucked"
02:11:05;02:11:07;"So he's probably reading it and he sees Trent Reznor being like"
02:11:07;02:11:08;"Yeah, Hootie and the Blowfish suck"
02:11:08;02:11:09;"And he's like, yeah, right on, man"
02:11:09;02:11:10;"Those guys suck"
02:11:10;02:11:11;"And he's like, hold on a second"
02:11:11;02:11:13;"And then you got f***ing REM who doesn't eat meat"
02:11:13;02:11:15;"And he's like, dude, come on"
02:11:15;02:11:17;"Also, it is one of those things where just like"
02:11:17;02:11:19;"Every sentence just takes it up a notch"
02:11:19;02:11:20;"See, he needs that"
02:11:20;02:11:22;"Doesn't need another Pearl Jam ripoff, man"
02:11:22;02:11:24;"Doesn't need the politically correct REM telling us"
02:11:24;02:11:25;"We don't eat meat"
02:11:25;02:11:26;"F*** you to all that"
02:11:26;02:11:27;"It's like, whoa, f*** you"
02:11:27;02:11:29;"The false equivalence"
02:11:29;02:11:31;"That these guys don't eat meat"
02:11:31;02:11:33;"And he's like, the only logical response"
02:11:33;02:11:35;"To the scourge of vegetarianism"
02:11:35;02:11:37;"Is more d*** off"
02:11:37;02:11:39;"Trent, you're a kook, man"
02:11:39;02:11:41;"I didn't know Trent was like, wacky like that"
02:11:41;02:11:42;"Whew"
02:11:42;02:11:44;"I always thought Trent would be like, kind of like a serious"
02:11:44;02:11:46;"I thought he'd be like, quoting like, uh"
02:11:46;02:11:47;"Nietzsche"
02:11:47;02:11:48;"Yeah, yeah, exactly"
02:11:48;02:11:50;"Heidegger"
02:11:50;02:11:52;"That actually is super Heidegger"
02:11:52;02:11:55;"Like, playing his alternate universe character"
02:11:55;02:11:59;"Anyway, we'll get to the bottom of this in the future"
02:11:59;02:12:01;"Peace and love, peace and love"
02:12:01;02:12:03;"Time Crisis"
02:12:05;02:12:07;"With Ezra King"
02:12:07;02:12:09;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-beast"
02:12:09;02:12:11;"One"
02:12:11;02:12:13;"(gunshot)"
