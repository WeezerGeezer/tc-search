00:00;00:06;"Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles with my good friend Jake Longstreth."
00:06;00:10;"We'll be talking about second career business ventures of notable musicians."
00:10;00:15;"And of course we're talking about one guy that we're a big fan of here at Time Crisis and Stay One,"
00:15;00:16;"and that's Billy Joel."
00:16;00:17;"Big time."
00:17;00:20;"We're gonna count down the top five songs on iTunes."
00:20;00:28;"Currently, right now, 2016, with the top five Billboard hits of this same week in 1968."
00:28;00:32;"We're gonna take a moment to appreciate rock history and the present."
00:32;00:33;"Love it."
00:33;00:34;"This is..."
00:34;00:38;"Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:38;00:42;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Spoiler alert!"
00:42;00:49;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:49;00:56;"The war I felt warm in me, all my rightful chances"
00:56;01:03;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
01:03;01:10;"And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:10;01:15;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:15;01:21;"Welcome back to Time Crisis, back in Los Angeles, Culver City, Southern California."
01:21;01:27;"I'm rejoined by our West Coast co-host and correspondent."
01:27;01:31;"West Coast co-host, that's a good phrase, Jake Longstreth."
01:31;01:32;"What's up, Jake?"
01:32;01:34;"Good to see you in the flesh again."
01:34;01:35;"Yeah, nice to see you."
01:35;01:36;"My man."
01:36;01:37;"Culver."
01:37;01:40;"Back here in Culver City. What's been up with you?"
01:40;01:42;"I bought a guitar yesterday."
01:42;01:43;"Really?"
01:43;01:46;"Yeah, I've been borrowing my friend Zach's guitar for three years."
01:46;01:47;"Like an acoustic?"
01:47;01:51;"No, an electric. I didn't have an electric. My brother stole my electric and then he lost it."
01:51;01:55;"And then, when I was out here, I needed a guitar, I borrowed it from my friend Zach."
01:55;02:01;"Then I realized I needed to give back his guitar because it's been three years, so I went and looked all day Sunday."
02:01;02:03;"Where'd you go? Guitar Center?"
02:03;02:06;"I dipped into the Pasadena Guitar Center. I didn't want to."
02:06;02:10;"I was talking all this game the night before, being like, ""I'm not going to go to Guitar Center."""
02:10;02:15;"And then I was rolling with my buddy and he was like, ""Let's just check it out, man. They have some cool used stuff."""
02:15;02:24;"Guitar Center is... I have nothing against the company, but as a consumer experience, it's kind of a nightmare."
02:24;02:25;"Yeah."
02:25;02:29;"I don't like noise, you know? I really hate when there's competing noise."
02:29;02:35;"I've always found South by Southwest, the festival in Texas, very difficult because you walk down the street"
02:35;02:40;"and you just hear all this music blaring out at the same time and you can't get a moment's peace."
02:40;02:46;"And when you go to Guitar Center, there's always a nine-year-old kid playing something on a keyboard,"
02:46;02:51;"just beats blaring, some dude shredding metal solos. It's kind of brutal."
02:51;03:00;"Shredding metal solos through a crappy distortion pedal has been the soundtrack of guitar stores for, what, 35, 40 years?"
03:00;03:02;"[Mimics guitar shredding]"
03:02;03:09;"Yeah, it's weird how that's just become the standard stock and trade move of dudes checking out guitars."
03:09;03:11;"There are so many shredders out there."
03:11;03:17;"I think for a lot of the shredder dudes, they have this incredible talent, which is the ability to shred."
03:17;03:26;"And maybe they don't have a band, maybe their, like, that kind of guitar work went out of fashion."
03:26;03:30;"I'm trying to think what the equivalent is. It's kind of like, so you got some free time,"
03:30;03:34;"and it's like you just roll over to Guitar Center, shred, maybe start a conversation."
03:34;03:35;"Oh, yeah."
03:35;03:37;"I don't judge it, but it's like..."
03:37;03:38;"No, not at all."
03:38;03:40;"You're looking for an affinity group."
03:40;03:45;"Dude, well, I ended up yesterday at Imperial Vintage Guitars in Burbank."
03:45;03:51;"And this was like a tiny, really cool shop, and I found this great kind of mid-70s Gibson that I bought."
03:51;03:56;"But in terms of, like, the guitar store culture, it was so full-on."
03:56;03:59;"There was one other dude in the store who was like a flight attendant."
03:59;04:02;"He could talk gear. Like, he went there to hang out."
04:02;04:07;"He was like, ""Oh, I have a flight out of Burbank in a few hours. I thought I'd just pop by the store, see what's going on."""
04:07;04:13;"You were just like, ""I just got here from Indianapolis. I'm shooting up to Juneau, Alaska in a few hours."""
04:13;04:15;"So, you know, it just took a few hours to just walk."
04:15;04:21;"And then he was just sort of like, ""Oh, yeah, this has DiMarzio pickups on it. That's not the usual Humbucker variety from the mid-70s."""
04:21;04:23;"He could just, like, go so deep."
04:23;04:26;"And then he was telling me this story about how Ian Anderson..."
04:26;04:27;"Who's that?"
04:27;04:29;"Ian Anderson is the dude from Jethro Tull."
04:29;04:30;"Okay."
04:30;04:34;"Who, as of five years ago, was the largest salmon importer in Great Britain."
04:34;04:35;"Really?"
04:35;04:41;"Yeah, like, second career. He got really into, like, importing, like, Canadian wild salmon."
04:41;04:49;"I love a feel-good story like that because, of course, it's, like, meaningful to me, but, like, people who start out in this horrible industry, the music industry..."
04:49;05:01;"And it's always, like, really nice to hear that they are able, like, somehow to make it out and to just, like, land in something kind of, like, cool that brings joy to people, like salmon importing."
05:01;05:08;"Like, I really hope that one day I can get into, I don't know, find something to import."
05:08;05:10;"Maybe weed?"
05:10;05:12;"I think I'm a little bit late in the..."
05:12;05:13;"Weed game?"
05:13;05:18;"In the weed game, but I don't know. I just always like to hear good stories about, like, musicians ending up, like..."
05:18;05:33;"Because think about it. When you're 65, would you rather be schlepping around the world, touring, having to do, like, 90 minutes of stretching before you go on stage just so you don't hurt yourself?"
05:33;05:47;"Or sitting in a gorgeous office with, you know, a beautiful mahogany desk, leather chair, just on the phone with your suppliers or whatever, just, like, you know, bringing this, like, delicious fish into the country that you're from."
05:47;05:49;"It just sounds so much better."
05:49;05:56;"Yeah. And especially if you're, like, a rock flute guy, like Ian Anderson, you have to have some serious warm-ups."
05:56;05:58;"Oh, yeah. Think about all the lung capacity you need."
05:58;05:59;"Can you imagine, like..."
05:59;06:02;"I think he used to jump around a lot with the flute. He was, like, the Pied Piper."
06:02;06:11;"I don't know why it was on this tangent, but I remember watching a Jethro Tull show from, like, '82 in, like, Orlando on YouTube."
06:11;06:16;"I was like, ""That is, like, the weirdest, deepest context."""
06:16;06:20;"[Humming]"
06:20;06:21;"What's their big song?"
06:21;06:22;"Aqualung, bro."
06:22;06:23;"Oh, yeah."
06:23;06:29;"Aqualung, my friend, don't you turn away again."
06:29;06:31;"So, Jethro Tull, they're, like, 60s."
06:31;06:33;"60s, 70s?"
06:33;06:37;"I bet. Like, their heyday was sort of early, mid-70s."
06:37;06:41;"Okay. I really don't know that much about Tull other than that they're famous for rock flute."
06:41;06:43;"Maybe we should listen to Aqualung. So, this is their big song."
06:43;06:45;"[Humming]"
06:45;06:47;"Is there a flute on it?"
06:47;06:49;"[Humming]"
06:49;06:50;"It's real riffy."
06:50;06:55;"[Humming]"
06:55;06:56;"That sounds familiar."
06:56;06:58;"It's, like, almost kind of Sabbath-y."
06:58;07:00;"That's cool."
07:00;07:05;"And then there's this cool acoustic part where he's, like, ""Oh, no, no, no."""
07:05;07:09;"It's, like, the other part. He's like, ""Snot is running down his nose."""
07:09;07:11;"""Snot is running down his nose."""
07:11;07:13;"""Sitting on a park bench."""
07:13;07:15;"All right. I'm getting excited for this."
07:15;07:18;"So, to all the Salmon fans out here, we got a hot track."
07:18;07:20;"It might be new to you. It's actually quite old."
07:20;07:25;"But coming from the second largest importer of Salmon in the U.K.?"
07:25;07:31;"The guy at Imperial Vintage Guitars in Burbank told me that Ian Anderson is the largest Salmon importer."
07:31;07:37;"This is a hot track coming from a singer, flutist, and Salmon importer, Ian Anderson,"
07:37;07:39;"whose group Jethro Tull, here's Aqualung."
07:46;08:02;"Some street dog, an old man wandering lonely, taking time the only way he does."
08:02;08:22;"He had a curtain fan as he bends to pick the dog end, goes down to the box and wants his feet."
08:22;08:37;"Feeling low, the army's on the road, it's our mission out above the coast."
08:37;08:57;"Aqualung, my friend, don't you start away uneasy. Your poor old son, you see, is a king to me."
08:57;09:01;"Do you still remember December's foggy freeze?"
09:01;09:06;"When they ice the clings onto your bed with screaming agony?"
09:06;09:11;"You snatch a rattling glass breath with deep sea dive sounds,"
09:11;09:20;"and the flowers bloom like madness in the spring."
09:20;09:30;"Some street dog, an old man wandering lonely, taking time the only way he does."
09:30;09:44;"He had a curtain fan as he bends to pick the dog end, goes down to the box and wants his feet."
09:44;09:54;"Feeling low, the army's on the road, it's our mission out above the coast."
09:54;10:05;"Aqualung, my friend, don't you start away uneasy. Your poor old son, you see, is a king to me."
10:06;10:10;"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
46:00;46:03;">> The Beatles with the Octopus's Garden."
46:03;46:05;"Let's not forget what's happening to our oceans."
46:05;46:07;">> Rivers and streams, lakes."
46:07;46:09;">> All of our water."
46:09;46:11;">> So today on Time Crisis,"
46:11;46:13;"we're talking about second careers."
46:13;46:15;"And you know, the second career can happen"
46:15;46:16;"simultaneously with the first."
46:16;46:17;">> Yep."
46:17;46:19;">> Many Americans work multiple jobs."
46:19;46:22;"So there's a band in the 80s called Glass Tiger."
46:22;46:23;"You remember them?"
46:23;46:25;">> Vaguely."
46:25;46:26;"That name is incredible."
46:26;46:27;"Glass Tiger."
46:27;46:30;">> There's a band now called Glass Animals."
46:30;46:31;">> Really?"
46:31;46:32;">> Yeah."
46:32;46:33;">> I wonder if they're aware of Glass Tiger."
46:33;46:34;">> I'm sure."
46:34;46:35;">> I was in a band once,"
46:35;46:37;"and we had a song called White Glass."
46:37;46:39;">> What does that mean, White Glass?"
46:39;46:40;"Like a cocaine thing?"
46:40;46:41;">> I didn't write the song,"
46:41;46:44;"but I think it was just trying to sound like Glass Tiger."
46:44;46:45;">> White Glass."
46:45;46:46;">> Yeah, basically."
46:46;46:48;">> Black Velvet."
46:48;46:50;"Their big hit was called Don't Forget Me When I'm Gone."
46:50;46:51;"It goes like this."
46:56;46:57;">> Oh, yeah."
47:01;47:04;">> Very poppy."
47:04;47:06;"They don't even really rock."
47:06;47:08;">> Yeah, just like 80s."
47:08;47:10;">> Wholesome pop."
47:10;47:11;">> Yeah."
47:11;47:12;">> You know this song?"
47:12;47:13;">> No."
47:29;47:31;">> Got that slight 80s shuffle."
47:31;47:33;"Ooh, key change."
47:33;47:37;"So 80s to do that really abrupt key change to the chorus."
47:49;47:51;">> I can't handle the 80s production right now."
47:51;47:54;"I'm not saying it's bad, but you got to be in a certain mood,"
47:54;47:58;"because the big horns, the snare, the reverb."
47:58;48:01;"So anyway, that was Glass Tiger."
48:01;48:06;"And the bassist in Glass Tiger, he's already a very successful guy."
48:06;48:07;">> What's his name?"
48:07;48:09;">> His name is Wayne Parker."
48:09;48:11;"I know that sounds made up."
48:11;48:13;"Why does that sound made up, Wayne Parker?"
48:13;48:16;"It just sounds like a made-up name."
48:16;48:19;"So anyway, Wayne Parker was the bassist in Glass Tiger,"
48:19;48:22;"and he now is the owner of Sky Shed POD,"
48:22;48:27;"a company that sells personal observatory domes to amateur astronomers."
48:27;48:29;"They're located just outside of Stratford, Ontario."
48:29;48:31;"I guess these guys are Canadian."
48:31;48:32;">> So what are you getting?"
48:32;48:33;"I don't even understand what that is."
48:33;48:36;">> I think you're getting some form of telescope."
48:36;48:38;">> A personal observation dome?"
48:38;48:42;">> I think it's like a telescope with--I don't know, man."
48:42;48:46;"It's something for amateur astronomers to behold the universe."
48:46;48:47;">> That's cool, man."
48:47;48:49;"That's super niche."
48:49;48:51;">> First of all, shout-out to Wayne Parker."
48:51;48:52;"That's cool."
48:52;48:58;"But do you ever think about hobbies and just get depressed?"
48:58;49:00;">> What do you mean?"
49:00;49:03;"Like grown men trading baseball cards?"
49:03;49:05;">> Yeah, that's a good example."
49:05;49:07;">> I remember I used to be really into cards when I was a kid,"
49:07;49:11;"and I'd go to the baseball card shop in the strip mall near my house,"
49:11;49:13;"and there would be like 35-year-old dudes in there."
49:13;49:16;"And I remember even being like 12 and just being like,"
49:16;49:19;"""What's up with--what's going on here?"""
49:19;49:20;">> They were probably looking at you like,"
49:20;49:22;"""What's this little 12-year-old twerp doing?"
49:22;49:24;"He doesn't appreciate baseball cards."""
49:24;49:25;"You know what it is, man?"
49:25;49:27;"I feel like I've probably said this before on the show."
49:27;49:35;"It's like I hate that our society gives us very mixed messages about hobbies."
49:35;49:38;"So say you're an amateur astronomer, and you're really passionate about it,"
49:38;49:40;"and it's like, ""Hey, I'm just doing this for me."
49:40;49:43;"I'm interested in reading what professional scientists are up to,"
49:43;49:45;"and I like checking out the stars and stuff."""
49:45;49:46;"I don't know."
49:46;49:48;"There's so much pressure in our culture to go pro."
49:48;49:52;"So I feel like the same way it's kind of like with the weekend warrior,"
49:52;49:55;"local dudes playing covers at the barn grill."
49:55;49:56;"I don't know."
49:56;49:58;"It's like our culture doesn't respect it."
49:58;50:01;"And maybe I think about that a lot because, like, yeah,"
50:01;50:03;"I've played music professionally, but at one point in my life,"
50:03;50:05;"I might just be living in the suburbs, you know,"
50:05;50:11;"just getting a few dads from my son's school together to just, you know,"
50:11;50:13;"play Mumford and Sons covers."
50:13;50:15;">> I'm thinking that there's a slot for you in PICS down the road."
50:15;50:17;">> It's very possible."
50:17;50:19;"But I'm just saying, like, why--I don't know."
50:19;50:23;"For some reason, the phrase ""amateur astronomer"" made me melancholic."
50:23;50:24;">> Wow. >> Because I love it."
50:24;50:27;"It's like, hell yeah, man, like, be an amateur astronomer."
50:27;50:29;"But then we live in this culture where it's like if you're not"
50:29;50:32;"Neil deGrasse Tyson, you're a weirdo."
50:32;50:37;"Like, sorry, maybe this dude didn't have time to go get a Ph.D. in astronomy."
50:37;50:40;"Maybe he was, like, you know, working three jobs."
50:40;50:44;"Maybe he got in a hometown jam or something, like, things didn't go his way."
50:44;50:45;"But you know what I mean?"
50:45;50:47;"It's like our culture doesn't respect amateurs."
50:47;50:50;">> If you're an amateur, you're putting time and energy into not being,"
50:50;50:52;"quote/unquote, productive."
50:52;50:57;">> Right, because our society values everything in terms of, like, productivity."
50:57;50:58;">> And if you're not making money doing it--"
50:58;51:02;">> I'm thinking of this from a male perspective because I identify as male."
51:02;51:04;"But, like, you're out with a wife."
51:04;51:08;"Maybe it's a double date, her friend from work."
51:08;51:11;"And you're talking to her husband, and maybe you're like--he's like,"
51:11;51:12;"""What are you up to?"""
51:12;51:16;"And you're like, ""I'm a bit of an amateur astronomer."""
51:16;51:20;">> I'd rather talk amateur astronomy with him, though, than, like, his job."
51:20;51:21;">> Well, exactly."
51:21;51:24;"I'm saying, like, that is kind of what makes people human."
51:24;51:26;">> Exactly. >> All right, now I got it."
51:26;51:29;"What makes people human is not your job, necessarily."
51:29;51:30;"It could be."
51:30;51:33;"But it's, like, you know, what makes you happy and passionate and curious."
51:33;51:39;"And yet I don't like that our culture draws such a hard line between professional and amateur."
51:40;51:44;"Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low, oh, oh"
51:44;51:49;"I leaned back on my radio, oh, oh"
51:49;51:56;"The cat was laying down some rock and roll, let us all listen"
51:56;52:00;"Then the loud sounds, it seemed to fight, fight, fight"
52:00;52:05;"Came back like a slow voice on a wave of fight, fight, fight"
52:05;52:14;"That one old DJ that was icy cosmic tight"
52:14;52:19;"There's a star man waiting in the sky"
52:19;52:24;"He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds"
52:24;52:29;"There's a star man waiting in the sky"
52:29;52:33;"He's told us not to blow it, 'cause he knows it's all worthwhile"
52:33;52:37;"He told me, let the children lose it"
52:37;52:39;"Let the children use it"
52:39;52:42;"Let all the children boogie"
52:58;53:03;"I had to phone someone so I picked on you, oh, oh"
53:03;53:07;"Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too, oh, oh"
53:07;53:14;"Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two"
53:14;53:19;"Look out your window, I can see his light, light, light"
53:19;53:24;"If we can sparkle, he may land tonight, night, night"
53:24;53:32;"Don't tell your papa, or he'll get us locked up in tight"
53:32;53:37;"There's a star man waiting in the sky"
53:37;53:42;"He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds"
53:42;53:47;"There's a star man waiting in the sky"
53:47;53:51;"He's told us not to blow it, 'cause he knows it's all worthwhile"
53:51;53:55;"He told me, let the children lose it"
53:55;53:57;"Let the children use it"
53:57;54:00;"Let all the children boogie"

54:24;54:26;"Let all the children boogie"
54:26;54:30;"Let all the children use it"
54:30;54:32;"It makes it so human and awesome."
54:32;54:38;"Like, when you started playing music, you weren't doing it to make a lot of money and have it be a career."
54:38;54:43;"It was doing it 'cause you were like, ""I'm a human. Humans play music. I love doing this."""
54:43;54:47;"This is like, something that's not utilitarian. You're not learning, like, long division."
54:47;54:53;"That's why one of my pet peeves about, like, you know, and also I think music criticism is really important."
54:53;54:56;"But then occasionally, one of the things that bothers me in a review,"
54:56;55:00;"not necessarily like a Vampire Weekend review, but just when I read a review of anything,"
55:00;55:06;"and there's... it's one thing to be like, ""I like this, I don't like this, I think this aspect of it's problematic,"
55:06;55:08;"I think it would've been better if it sounded..."""
55:08;55:12;"But there's something like when somebody reviews an album, and they're just kind of like, ""What's the point?"
55:12;55:15;"They didn't need that song on the record."""
55:15;55:18;"And there's something about that that also just makes me sad, 'cause it's like, man,"
55:18;55:22;"say you don't like it, but it's like, there's just something so cruel about, like,"
55:22;55:23;"why did they put that on?"
55:23;55:24;"Unnecessary."
55:24;55:25;"Yeah, unnecessary."
55:25;55:28;"Well, it's like Newsflash, none of it's necessary, bro."
55:28;55:30;"Our lives are not necessary."
55:30;55:34;"It's as if human existence is pointless."
55:34;55:36;"Well, no, I would draw a distinction."
55:36;55:37;"Right."
55:37;55:41;"I'm not gonna get so harsh that they'll say our lives aren't necessary, but..."
55:41;55:45;"music is not necessary, and that's what's so amazing about it."
55:45;55:46;"Yeah."
55:46;55:47;"That's my thesis."
55:47;55:50;"I guess what I'm saying is, yeah, that the part of a review that says,"
55:50;55:55;"""The album started strong, but, like, didn't need that skit in the middle."""
55:55;55:56;"I'm making up an example."
55:56;56:00;"Like, ""What was the purpose of that John Mellencamp cover, track 8?"
56:00;56:01;"That was totally unnecessary."""
56:01;56:04;"That's just, like, some middle management type that's kind of like,"

56:07;56:11;"Let's cut out all the unnecessary slides in our PowerPoint."""

56:17;56:19;"Oh, we'd get slaughtered."

56:48;56:49;"What?"
56:49;56:50;"Yeah, it's great. I love it."
56:50;56:51;"All right."

01:00:07;01:00:09;"So you're listening to Time Crisis."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"We've been talking a lot about the meaning of life,"
01:00:12;01:00:16;"second careers, amateur versus professional."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"It's tough out there, man, I gotta say."

01:00:25;01:00:27;"That's what I'm saying."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"So with that in mind, we're gonna take a moment"
01:00:30;01:00:34;"to appreciate rock history and the present."
01:00:34;01:00:38;"And we're gonna do that with a segment we call Top 5."
01:00:38;01:00:45;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes."
01:00:45;01:00:50;"So this week's Top 5, we're gonna do a more complicated one"
01:00:50;01:00:52;"as we sometimes do on Time Crisis,"
01:00:52;01:00:55;"where we compare the Top 5 songs on iTunes currently,"
01:00:55;01:00:59;"right now, 2016, with the Top 5 Billboard hits"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"of this same week in 1968."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Love it."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Why did we choose 1968, Jake?"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"Well, this has been a theme recently on the show"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"the last few months because of the election."
01:01:12;01:01:15;"And people are drawing, especially during the primaries,"
01:01:15;01:01:19;"people were drawing a lot of comparisons to 1968."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"Tumultuous time in the country."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"Exactly."
01:01:22;01:01:25;"And it's still, I mean, with Trump being the nominee,"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"I mean, that is, we are on the precipice"
01:01:29;01:01:33;"of a serious, tumultuous, crazy time."
01:01:33;01:01:37;"It's already tumultuous, racism, people getting killed,"
01:01:37;01:01:40;"it's horrible, and now, yeah, we're holding our breath."
01:01:40;01:01:43;"Is it gonna get better, worse, or the same?"
01:01:43;01:01:46;"A lot of people would accept the same, but whatever."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"1968 was also a crazy time."
01:01:48;01:01:52;"So how does the popular music of an era reflect the time?"
01:01:52;01:01:53;"Does it?"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"If it, maybe not."
01:01:54;01:01:55;"Maybe not at all."
01:01:55;01:01:58;"So let's start by going back to the number 5 song."

01:02:01;01:02:06;"This week in 1968, America was in flames."

01:04:03;01:04:06;"So basically this guy, this is a song about being annoyed"

01:04:07;01:04:10;"It's almost a lateral move from Gary Puckett."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"Yeah."
01:04:11;01:04:15;"God, what kind of nonsense was on the charts back then?"
01:04:15;01:04:18;"Okay, that's a pretty big difference from 2016."
01:04:18;01:04:21;"Nobody's trying to listen to a pop song about--"

01:08:45;01:08:47;"There's a lot to unpack here."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Definitely a cooler song,"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"just in terms of, like, mood."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"Sure. A cooler song than the 1910 fruit gum."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"What do you think, Jake?"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"You're not a big pop guy."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"I mean, at the end of the day, probably equally innocuous."
01:09:00;01:09:04;"Maybe I prefer the palette of late '60s bubble gum"
01:09:04;01:09:09;"to, like, 2016 chopped up, uh..."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"Pop music?"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"You just like that analog sound."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"Yeah, it's warm."
01:09:15;01:09:18;"I don't know what to do with the palette that we just listened to."
01:09:18;01:09:20;"But that's my perspective."
01:09:20;01:09:22;"You're just not a modern guy."
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Well..."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"I mean, like, which would you rather listen to at the gym?"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"And I'm talking about, like, the end,"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"the last few reps."
01:09:30;01:09:32;"I would go with the 1910 Fruit Company all the way."
01:09:32;01:09:34;"At the gym? At the end of the session"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"when your trainer is making you dig real deep for those last few..."
01:09:36;01:09:38;"You want to listen to bubble gum from the late '60s?"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"I do."
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Okay, what about when you're, like, pulling up to an exclusive restaurant,"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"like, pulling up to the valet, which would you rather have playing?"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"I think I'm gonna choose..."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"1910 Fruit Company."
01:09:48;01:09:50;"Oh, my God, really?"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"I'm not saying it's qualitatively better."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"It's just a palette thing."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"It truly is apples and oranges."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"Gold."
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Peppermint or Spearmint?"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"Let's go back to 1968."
01:10:02;01:10:04;"The number four song this week"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"in 1968 was"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"Deep Purple with the Hush."
01:10:08;01:10:16;"Spooky beginning."
01:10:16;01:10:18;"I like that noise level."
01:10:18;01:10:20;"Hear that tape hiss?"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Yeah, I love it."
01:10:22;01:10:24;"I don't know if I know this."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Oh, yeah, I know this one."
01:10:26;01:10:34;"(beatboxing)"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"Oh, okay."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"You know this one."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"(singing)"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"Definitely rocks."
01:10:52;01:10:54;"(beatboxing)"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"Does this feel like it's, like, a rip-off of a Beatles song?"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"Yeah, kind of."
01:10:58;01:11:00;"(singing)"
01:11:00;01:11:04;"Feels like part of a Beatles song, ""Loot."""
01:11:04;01:11:14;"This is the most rock song"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"that we've heard from 1968"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"so far on this show."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"It's kind of heavy."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Now, this sounds like Tumult."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"Yeah."
01:11:24;01:11:36;"(singing)"
01:11:36;01:11:42;"Do you know this song?"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Yeah, it sounds familiar."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"I didn't know it was Deep Purple."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"(singing)"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"I want it, I need it (I need it)"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"I gotta have it"
01:11:58;01:12:04;"She got a lovin' like quicksand"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"Only took one touch of her hand"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"Blown my mind and I'm in so deep"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"That I can't eat or I can't sleep"
01:12:10;01:12:15;"Na na na na na na na na na"
01:12:24;01:12:30;"Listen, hush, hush"
01:12:30;01:12:33;"Thought I heard her callin' my name now"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"Hush, hush"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"She broke my heart but her lovin' just ain't now"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"Hush, hush"
01:12:39;01:12:42;"Thought I heard her callin' my name now"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Hush, hush"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"I need her lovin' and I'm not to blame now"
01:12:46;01:12:47;"Hush, hush"
01:12:47;01:12:49;"She got a hurtin' in the mornin'"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"She got a layin' in need now"
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Hush, hush"
01:12:53;01:12:55;"Hey, I gotta, gotta"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Deeply rock drumming"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"I can't imagine being on a psychedelic drug"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"Or just really stoned, looking up at the ceiling"
01:13:01;01:13:04;"And be like, ""Whoa, is Nixon really gonna be president, man?"""
01:13:04;01:13:06;"That feels very 1968 to me"
01:13:06;01:13:12;"So what's the equivalent for a moral person in 2016"
01:13:12;01:13:15;"Who's deeply blazed one night at home"
01:13:15;01:13:18;"Staring up at the ceiling like, ""You kidding me, man?"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"""Is Trump really gonna be president?"""
01:13:20;01:13:22;"What's that guy listening to?"
01:13:22;01:13:25;"So we gotta come back to 2016 with the number four song"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Picture the scene"
01:13:26;01:13:27;"Okay"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"Hanging out with your buddies, but everybody kinda goes quiet"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"You just got off work at Red Lobster"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"So all you wanna do is get stoned"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Go over to your buddy's house, you get blazed"
01:13:35;01:13:38;"At first you're giggling, watching like, YouTube cat videos"
01:13:38;01:13:41;"And then like, your buddy turns to you and is like"
01:13:41;01:13:44;"""Yo, man, I think Trump might actually win"""
01:13:44;01:13:46;"And you're just like, ""What? What?"""
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Look up at the ceiling and"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Why wait to say"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"At least I did it my way"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Lie way too faced"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"But in my heart I understand"
01:13:56;01:13:59;"Is that really the direction America's heading in, man?"
01:13:59;01:14:02;"He's like a ashes, man"
01:14:02;01:14:05;"This is Calvin Harris, by the way"
01:14:05;01:14:06;"Who's singing?"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"Calvin, he sings"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Raspy voice"
01:14:12;01:14:13;"Yeah, he's a good singer"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:14:15;01:14:19;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"My way"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"This is the best Calvin Harris song I've ever heard in my life"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"Really?"
01:14:23;01:14:24;"Yeah"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"You must really be so..."
01:14:26;01:14:32;"It's all the ice coffee, bro"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"I'm amped right now"
01:14:34;01:14:37;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:14:37;01:14:50;"It's not bad"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"I'm just saying he's made so many great songs"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"I'm surprised that this is the one"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"Yeah"
01:14:55;01:14:59;"When I met you in the summer"
01:14:59;01:15:00;"You don't know that one?"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"Maybe, if I heard it, I don't know"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"Baby, this is what you came for"
01:15:04;01:15:05;"That song, no"
01:15:05;01:15:06;"You like this one better?"
01:15:06;01:15:07;"Yeah"
01:15:07;01:15:08;"Well, see, the beginning of this song"
01:15:08;01:15:11;"Approached something emotional and idiosyncratic"
01:15:11;01:15:15;"This is kind of an idiosyncratic sound"
01:15:15;01:15:16;"I understand"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I made my move"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"And it was all about you"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"I feel so far removed"
01:15:22;01:15:25;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:15:27;01:15:30;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:15:33;01:15:35;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"My way"
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"My way"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"My way"
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"My way"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"My way"
01:15:56;01:16:13;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:16:15;01:16:18;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"You are the one thing in my way"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"Pretty trite. It's a nice song, yeah, because I have a feeling..."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"Obviously it's easy to appreciate that, of like..."
01:28:05;01:28:07;"It's so evocative of a bygone era, but..."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Let's picture like 1968..."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"We're like out there, you know, protesting..."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"Our buddies are getting sent to Vietnam..."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Fight in a pointless imperialist war..."
01:28:15;01:28:17;"You know..."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"There's still like opposition to civil rights..."
01:28:19;01:28:21;"You know, just brutal things are happening all over the place..."
01:28:21;01:28:23;"And then the rascals..."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"And then the rascals come in and they're like..."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"""Oh, we're gonna have a little bit of a party..."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"We're gonna have a little bit of a party..."
