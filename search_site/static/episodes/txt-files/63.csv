00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis, Oscars wrap up."
00:05;00:07;"We'll talk about that a little bit."
00:07;00:12;"We'll also talk about the controversial children's film, Peter Rabbit."
00:12;00:18;"We'll also dig back into our favorite Diet Coke commercial, but this time with a twist."
00:18;00:26;"All this, plus listener emails and the top 10 songs on iTunes right now."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:36;"Beats 1."
00:36;00:56;"Time Crisis."
01:18;01:20;"Time Crisis back at it again."
01:20;01:22;"It's showtime."
01:22;01:29;"In classic Time Crisis fashion, because we're every two weeks, it means that we got a lot of news to cover."
01:29;01:37;"It's not always the freshest news, but we reheat it here for our listeners because we're their primary news source."
01:37;01:40;"Last Sunday was the Oscars."
01:40;01:41;"Did you go?"
01:41;01:43;"I didn't go to the Oscars."
01:43;01:46;"I feel like if there was an award show, there's like a 30% chance you went."
01:46;01:47;"That I went?"
01:47;01:48;"Yeah."
01:48;01:52;"There's actually a party and a viewing event/party for it."
01:52;01:53;"Vanity Fair party?"
01:53;01:54;"Exactly."
01:54;01:55;"Nice."
01:55;01:59;"Yeah, they have this little dinner and you watch and hang out."
01:59;02:01;"There's a massive party."
02:01;02:02;"Right."
02:02;02:03;"It's a famous thing."
02:03;02:04;"People are covering it."
02:04;02:05;"It's a major Hollywood event."
02:05;02:07;"I didn't know about it until recently."
02:07;02:09;"I was like, ""Where's my invite?"""
02:09;02:11;"Maybe I'll try to get you in next year."
02:11;02:12;"I'm already-"
02:12;02:13;"To see coverage."
02:13;02:14;"I'm already just a plus one."
02:14;02:16;"Maybe I can get a plus one, plus one."
02:16;02:17;"Actually, you know what?"
02:17;02:20;"I saw when the big party started, I saw a lot of the Apple crew."
02:20;02:22;"I saw Zane was in the building."
02:22;02:25;"Apple's got a connection to it, so they should be inviting more personalities."
02:25;02:26;"Right, man."
02:26;02:28;"I saw Charli XCX there."
02:28;02:33;"You're just as much a beats one radio personality as she is."
02:33;02:34;"I saw Haim there."
02:34;02:36;"Now I'm feeling kind of bad about myself."
02:36;02:37;"We're going to get you in."
02:37;02:38;"Why wasn't I there?"
02:38;02:40;"Why didn't I get that invite?"
02:43;02:47;"#JaketVanityAffair2019."
02:47;03:05;"But anyway, so yeah, I watched the Oscars at this event."
03:05;03:07;"Did you watch them at home?"
03:07;03:09;"Yeah, I kind of dipped in and out."
03:09;03:10;"Yeah?"
03:10;03:11;"You get some goldfish in a bowl?"
03:11;03:12;"I didn't do that."
03:12;03:14;"Did you have people over?"
03:14;03:16;"I was rolling solo."
03:16;03:17;"Oh."
03:17;03:21;"Hannah was out of town, and I put out a few feelers to people, like, ""Hey, are you watching?"""
03:21;03:22;"Because I don't have cable."
03:22;03:24;"You need cable to watch the Oscars?"
03:24;03:25;"Or a digital antenna."
03:25;03:28;"I did a little research to try to suss this out."
03:28;03:34;"This is pathetic, but I ended up opening a Hulu live account, because you get a free one-week trial."
03:34;03:35;"Yeah."
03:35;03:40;"So I streamed it live and then immediately canceled the account the second the Oscars were over."
03:40;03:41;"Okay, nice."
03:41;03:43;"I was double-screening it."
03:43;03:51;"I was watching on my laptop, and I was actually working on some art-related stuff on that same laptop with multiple windows."
03:51;03:52;"Okay."
03:52;03:55;"With the phone also texting with Hannah and other people."
03:55;03:57;"You felt like you were at a party."
03:57;03:58;"Yeah."
03:58;03:59;"It wasn't too lonely of an experience."
03:59;04:01;"I was drinking some tequila."
04:01;04:03;"Oh, solo tequila."
04:03;04:07;"Went out and got a burger solo, like, midway through."
04:07;04:08;"It was a pretty sick night."
04:08;04:09;"Yeah?"
04:09;04:10;"But I kind of missed a lot of stuff."
04:10;04:12;"Like, they kept making references to Jet Ski."
04:12;04:13;"I missed that, too."
04:13;04:15;"I missed the first, like, 45 minutes."
04:15;04:17;"So I didn't know what was going on."
04:17;04:21;"Jet Ski, yeah, it was some joke Jimmy Kimmel made about whoever gave the shortest speech would win a Jet Ski."
04:32;04:34;"There's so much to talk about the Oscars."
04:34;04:35;"It's Hollywood's biggest night."
04:35;04:36;"It's a big night."
04:36;04:37;"It's a major night."
04:37;04:40;"Although, apparently, fewer people than ever are actually watching it on TV."
04:40;04:41;"Sure."
04:41;04:42;"Who cares about that?"
04:42;04:46;"First and foremost, this is a music show and a food show."
04:46;04:50;"So this show is for musos and foodies."
04:50;04:51;"And history buffs."
04:51;04:53;"And history buffs."
04:53;04:54;"It's not really a show for cinephiles."
04:54;04:57;"No, we touch on movies, but not very often."
04:57;04:59;"Movies is low down the list for us on time."
04:59;05:04;"And there's a lot of great radio shows, podcasts about movies for cinephiles."
05:04;05:07;"If you were a voting member of the Academy, what would you have voted for?"
05:07;05:08;"Best picture."
05:08;05:09;"Go."
05:09;05:10;"Don't think about it."
05:10;05:11;"Get Out."
05:11;05:12;"Yeah, agreed."
05:12;05:15;"Yeah, everybody that I was sitting with was really bummed that Get Out didn't win."
05:15;05:16;"But, you know, whatever."
05:16;05:17;"Yeah, awards for art."
05:17;05:18;"It's all kind of silly."
05:18;05:19;"It's all kind of wacky."
05:19;05:25;"But because, as I said, this is a music show, first and foremost, we should talk about how there's music at the Oscars."
05:25;05:26;"Right, we should."
05:26;05:32;"They nominate the best song, which is an original song for the Oscars."
05:32;05:34;"So did you catch any of those performances?"
05:34;05:35;"Yeah."
05:35;05:36;"Did you see Sufjan?"
05:36;05:38;"I miss Sufjan."
05:38;05:40;"Playing this song, Mystery of Love."
05:40;05:42;"Did you see this movie, Call Me By Your Name?"
05:42;05:43;"I did, yeah, in the theater."
05:43;05:44;"Great movie."
05:44;05:46;"A timeless film, really."
05:46;05:48;"This is a very pretty song."
05:48;05:50;"The more I hear it, I'm like, ""Yeah, it's a good song."""
05:50;05:54;"Yeah, and I think I only wish he sang all the songs in Italian."
05:54;05:55;"That's my one note."
05:55;05:56;"That would have been tight."
05:56;06:04;"I remember knowing going into the film that it was set in 1983 and that there was a Sufjan song in it."
06:04;06:10;"I remember being worried that there would be an incongruous tonal clash between--"
06:10;06:11;"But you didn't feel that way?"
06:11;06:13;"No, I think it blended in okay."
06:13;06:16;"Because the other music in the movie was of the period."
06:16;06:18;"And this has a pretty tasteful, timeless palette."
06:18;06:22;"Yeah, I mean, you can tell it's new, but it's definitely not from the '80s."
06:22;06:24;"But it wasn't jarring."
06:43;06:45;"Who did he perform with?"
06:45;06:48;"He also had Moses Somni and St. Vincent with him."
06:48;06:49;"That was cool."
06:49;06:50;"That little crew performing."
06:50;06:51;"Heavy hitters."
06:51;06:57;"I did catch the last one, I think, which was a very aspirational song."
06:57;06:59;"Was it this one from The Greatest Showman?"
06:59;07:01;"This is a big film."
07:01;07:03;"The Greatest Showman is a big hit musical."
07:03;07:05;"I love the idea of the subject matter."
07:05;07:06;"Which is what?"
07:06;07:08;"It's P.T. Bartum, right?"
07:08;07:13;"He's a fascinating figure, but the fact that it's a musical, I'm like, ""Nope, I will never see it."""
07:13;07:14;"What, you don't like musicals?"
07:14;07:15;"I don't."
07:15;07:17;"We've had this conversation on TC before."
07:17;07:19;"I don't think this is the one I saw."
08:16;08:19;"This is really just a straight up pop song."
08:19;08:21;"This is like a fight song style."
08:21;08:23;"I was just going to say, this is a total fight song."
08:23;08:26;"This is Meghan Trainor style."
08:26;08:27;"Alright."
08:27;08:33;"Those songs are tough where you're like, I mean, Queen, We Are The Champions is an amazing version of that idea."
08:33;08:39;"Let's write a triumphant song where we're brave, we're heroic, we kill it."
08:39;08:43;"That's a really hard emotion to articulate in song."
08:43;08:46;"Not many versions that do it well."
08:46;08:48;"Yeah, Star Spangled Banner."
08:48;08:49;"That's a good one."
08:49;08:50;"Eminem, Lose Yourself."
08:50;08:53;"Yeah, but that's tinged with sadness."
08:53;08:55;"He's got mom's spaghetti on his sweater."
08:55;08:57;"The infamous mom's spaghetti."
08:57;08:59;"Just straight triumph is tough."
08:59;09:00;"It's funny."
09:00;09:04;"I feel like there's more of those types of songs in the past 20 years than back in the day."
09:04;09:05;"I agree."
09:05;09:10;"I feel like most pop stars at this point have at least one song in their repertoire that's kind of like their,"
09:10;09:12;"you know, maybe for Taylor Swift, it's like Shake It Off."
09:12;09:14;"Like, you know, forget the haters."
09:14;09:16;"You're better than them."
09:16;09:21;"Was there like a Fleetwood Mac song that was quite ever that straightforward?"
09:21;09:23;"You Can Go Your Own Way?"
09:23;09:24;"Not really, though. That's different."
09:24;09:26;"That's like F off."
09:26;09:30;"Yeah, nowadays it's like that's the type of song that you need in your arsenal."
09:30;09:32;"God, that's weak."
09:32;09:34;"Such a weak form."
09:34;09:37;"I wonder if Queen thought We Are The Champions was funny at all."
09:37;09:38;"That's a great question, actually."
09:38;09:40;"That's crossed my mind before, especially--"
09:40;09:42;"Wait, throw it on."
09:42;09:47;"Also, it's funny how We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You are kind of like one song, right?"
09:47;09:49;"Right, right, yeah, they play them back to back."
09:49;09:50;"Yeah."
09:53;09:56;"So this is pretty minor."
09:56;09:57;"Well, because it starts out--"
09:57;09:58;"Please pay my dues."
09:58;09:59;"Yeah."
10:04;10:06;"Wrongfully accused."
10:11;10:13;"It also kind of sounds like Everybody Hurts."
10:13;10:14;"Yeah."
10:14;10:15;"I'd sell this record."
10:32;10:34;"Those guitar tones are amazing."
10:45;10:49;"But yeah, think about them listening back in the playback booth and just being like,"
10:49;10:53;"""This is hilarious and awesome."""
10:56;10:59;"Of the world."
10:59;11:03;"Wait, is it no time for losing or no time for losers?"
11:03;11:04;"Losers."
11:04;11:08;"That's also the thing that people forget about with Queen because it gets kind of decontextualized"
11:08;11:09;"as time goes on."
11:09;11:15;"Bohemian Rhapsody is like a totally wacky, campy, funny, satirical song."
11:15;11:19;"And then think about other early Queen [bleep] like Fat Bottom Girls."
11:19;11:20;"Right."
11:20;11:21;"""I Want My Bicycle."""
11:21;11:22;"You know, he really had--"
11:22;11:24;"Bicycle."
11:24;11:27;"He had this sense of fun, silliness in Queen."
11:27;11:28;"Right."
11:28;11:30;"Yeah, so him rolling in the studio like, ""I got an idea for a song."
11:30;11:31;"We are the champions."""
11:31;11:32;"Of the world."
11:32;11:37;"Just them in like late '70s, just like [bleep] London."
11:37;11:40;"Just like no time for losers."
11:40;11:41;"Amazing."
11:41;11:43;"I mean, it's a sick song."
11:47;11:50;"My curtain calls"
11:50;11:55;"You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes"
11:55;11:58;"I thank you all"
11:58;12:01;"But it's been no bed of roses"
12:01;12:05;"No pleasure cruise"
12:05;12:10;"I consider it a challenge before the whole human race"
12:10;12:13;"And I ain't gonna lose"
12:13;12:17;"Come on, come on, come on, come on"
12:17;12:23;"We are the champions, my friends"
12:23;12:30;"And we keep on fighting 'til the end"
12:30;12:35;"We are the champions"
12:35;12:39;"We are the champions"
12:40;12:43;"No time for losers"
12:43;12:47;"'Cause we are the champions"
12:47;12:49;"Of the world"
12:49;12:50;"Here's Mary J. Blige."
12:50;12:52;"Did you catch her performance?"
12:52;12:53;"I missed it."
12:53;12:54;"Oh, wait, no, I caught it."
12:54;12:57;"This is the first time I think that somebody was nominated for--"
12:57;12:58;"Song."
12:58;12:59;"--and actor."
12:59;13:00;"Cool."
13:00;13:02;"Life is a teacher"
13:02;13:05;"Time is a healer"
13:05;13:08;"And I'm a believer"
13:09;13:12;"Like a river while"
13:12;13:15;"Ego's a killer"
13:15;13:17;"Also, so far, all the songs nominated are, like, serious."
13:17;13:18;"Yeah."
13:18;13:22;"Like, it was cool when, like, Pharrell got nominated for ""Happy."""
13:22;13:23;"Right."
13:23;13:29;"Yeah, I feel like the tone of the Oscars songs are, like, bloated, heavy ballads."
13:29;13:31;"It's, like, not fun."
13:31;13:33;"I don't want to hide"
13:33;13:35;"No lines in the sand"
13:35;13:38;"I'm on your side"
13:39;13:44;"There was also Andra Day's ""Stand Up for Something,"" featuring Common."
13:44;13:45;"Good production."
13:45;13:50;"You can have all the money in your hands"
13:50;13:54;"Oh, this is where Common went, like, super political, right?"
13:54;13:56;"Yeah, this is from the film ""Marshall."""
13:56;13:57;"Oh, okay."
13:57;13:59;"Missed that one."
13:59;14:03;"Well, 'cause that's, you know, a serious story about the Thurgood Marshall biopic."
14:06;14:11;"You can have, you can have everything"
14:11;14:16;"I guess it's, like, with the movies, they choose the real serious ones for the most part."
14:16;14:18;"So I guess with music, they kind of do the same thing."
14:18;14:22;"It's the same way that you don't see, like, comedies ever cleaning up at the Oscars."
14:22;14:23;"Right."
14:23;14:26;"There's also just not gonna be, like, fun, goofy songs."
14:26;14:29;"Was that ""Timberlake"" song from ""Trolls"" nominated?"
14:29;14:32;"No. See, yeah, exactly."
14:32;14:35;"Maybe it should have been. Terrible song, but it was, you know."
14:35;14:37;"I've got this feeling."
14:37;14:39;"I think it might have been nominated, actually. It didn't win."
14:39;14:41;"Wait, wait, you played the Oscars, right?"
14:41;14:42;"I did play the Oscars once."
14:42;14:43;"What was that story?"
14:43;14:48;"Karen Oh wrote this song called ""Moon Song"" for the Spike Jonze movie ""Her."""
14:48;14:49;"Oh."
14:49;14:52;"And we had done kind of, like, a studio duet of it."
14:52;14:57;"And then she got invited to play, and then they asked if I would back her up."
14:57;15:00;"And Spike had this idea to direct the segment, and it's, like, really, it's cool."
15:00;15:04;"It was, like, 'cause, you know, sometimes they do these, like, big spectacles."
15:04;15:08;"So his idea was just me playing acoustic, me and Karen just singing together."
15:08;15:11;"Just sitting on the steps, and then he put, like, a big moon behind us."
15:11;15:12;"I remember."
15:12;15:13;"It's very tasteful."
15:13;15:16;"I think I was not aware that that was happening."
15:16;15:17;"Oh, really?"
15:17;15:18;"And I was just like, ""Whoa!"""
15:18;15:20;"Check it out."
15:20;15:22;"That was stressful."
15:22;15:25;"I know him, guys. I know that guy."
15:25;15:27;"I bet that was stressful."
15:27;15:32;"Well, just because I'd never played-- I've only done a handful of live TV things."
15:32;15:33;"Yeah."
15:33;15:35;"SNL, which is stressful, too."
15:35;15:36;"That seems hella stressful."
15:36;15:37;"But this is bigger."
15:37;15:39;"And also it was stressful because this was Karen's song."
15:39;15:41;"So I'm there to back her up."
15:41;15:42;"Like, imagine if I just, like, brutally--"
15:42;15:43;"Went to the wrong chord?"
15:43;15:45;"--up a chord, and she would just be, like, she's already stressed."
15:45;15:46;"It's so much pressure on her."
15:46;15:48;"She's nominated, you know?"
15:48;15:50;"Were you trying to, like, not overthink it?"
15:50;15:52;"Were you like, ""Okay, I know the next chord is a G."
15:52;15:53;"Wait, is it a G?"
15:53;15:54;"Wait, is it?"""
15:54;15:57;"I think when it happened, I didn't have time to think."
15:57;15:58;"Nice."
15:58;16:00;"And then I remember I was so exhausted afterwards"
16:00;16:03;"that I was on my way to the Vanity Fair party."
16:03;16:07;"I was, like, alone in, like, a huge SUV that, like, the studio had hired for me."
16:07;16:08;"Wow."
16:08;16:10;"And I had gone to this other party, and I was just, like, rolling solo"
16:10;16:12;"because I didn't have any pluses or anything."
16:12;16:14;"And I just remember, like, getting there at, like, 1 a.m.,"
16:14;16:16;"and they were, like, supposed to have my name."
16:16;16:17;"Like, they didn't."
16:17;16:19;"And the driver's like, ""All right, well, we'll try to sort this out."
16:19;16:20;"Let me pull over."""
16:20;16:23;"And then I remember, like, I sent a couple texts to, like,"
16:23;16:25;"whoever was supposed to get me in."

18:57;18:58;"Yeah."
18:58;18:59;"Three and a half, whatever it was."
18:59;19:01;"They're bringing out food, and people are chatting,"
19:01;19:03;"and it's like a lively atmosphere."
19:03;19:04;"Sounds fun."
19:04;19:06;"Also, I forgot-- in classic TC fashion--"
19:06;19:09;"I forgot that I recently wrote a song for a movie."
19:09;19:10;"Yeah?"
19:10;19:12;"I should have talked about this in the last episode, but I forgot."
19:12;19:15;"Did you know that I wrote a song for Peter Rabbit?"
19:15;19:16;"No."
19:16;19:17;"What's Peter Rabbit?"
19:17;19:19;"Peter Rabbit."
19:19;19:22;"Are you familiar with the character Peter Rabbit?"
19:22;19:24;"Vaguely. It's a children's thing?"
19:24;19:25;"Yeah, he's a little rabbit."
19:25;19:27;"He wears a blue coat."
19:27;19:28;"Okay, yep."
19:28;19:30;"And it's--"
19:30;19:31;"Originally--"
19:31;19:32;"Copy that."
19:32;19:36;"Little kids have them, like these little white books"
19:36;19:38;"that are by Beatrix Potter."
19:38;19:40;"There's a whole large-- like a Peter Rabbit universe."
19:40;19:41;"Yep."
19:41;19:42;"Takes place in rural England."
19:42;19:43;"It's very sweet."
19:43;19:45;"When I was a kid, I always liked Peter Rabbit."
19:45;19:47;"I had a Peter Rabbit stuffed animal."
19:47;19:50;"So anyway, the director hit me up"
19:50;19:52;"because they were using a bunch of Vampire Weekend songs"
19:52;19:54;"in the movie, or they wanted to."
19:54;19:55;"Oh, wow."
19:55;19:56;"Is the movie out?"
19:56;19:58;"Yeah, it's been out for like four weeks."
19:58;19:59;"How's it doing?"
19:59;20:00;"It's doing solid."
20:00;20:02;"You know, I felt like--"
20:02;20:03;"Can we bring in the RA?"
20:03;20:04;"Well, first, let me tell you something."
20:04;20:05;"Yeah, yeah, go ahead."
20:05;20:07;"They're like, ""We want to use a bunch of Vampire Weekend songs"
20:07;20:08;"in the movie."""
20:08;20:09;"And I was like, ""All right."""
20:09;20:10;"They were like old songs."
20:10;20:11;"Wow."
20:11;20:13;"It was like M79 and stuff, and I was like, ""That's cool."""
20:13;20:15;"And then they said, ""Oh, and also,"
20:15;20:18;"would you want to write some original music for it?"""
20:18;20:20;"And I was like, ""I could try to write a song."
20:20;20:23;"Oh, also, James Corden is the voice of Peter Rabbit."""
20:23;20:24;"Friend of the show."
20:25;20:26;"So they were like, ""Can you write a song"
20:26;20:28;"for James Corden to sing as Peter Rabbit?"""
20:28;20:31;"And I gave it a try, and at first came up with something weird."
20:31;20:33;"And then as we worked on it, I realized it's like really annoying"
20:33;20:38;"to write something with the hard constraints of like a film."
20:38;20:39;"Yeah."
20:39;20:41;"Because, you know, I had like a lot of like talks to the director about like--"
20:41;20:43;"he was like, ""Well, we want it to be kind of this theme."""
20:43;20:46;"Because in the movie, there's a lot of talk about"
20:46;20:48;"the Mr. McGregor puts up a fence"
20:48;20:50;"and doesn't want to let the rabbits in to the garden,"
20:50;20:51;"wants to kill them."
20:51;20:53;"So he's like, ""Maybe it's this theme about like no fences,"
20:53;20:55;"and what does it really mean to be a hero?"""
20:55;20:57;"Because that's Peter Rabbit's journey and stuff."
20:57;20:59;"So I tried to like figure it out a little bit."
20:59;21:01;"We worked on it, and he helped me with the lyrics,"
21:01;21:03;"and we made this song."
21:03;21:05;"So my demo, of course, was like--"
21:05;21:07;"they wanted to be kind of like a kids' movie thing,"
21:07;21:10;"but I'm just like a laid-back, chilled-out dude."
21:10;21:13;"So my demo is pretty chilled out."
21:13;21:14;"It wasn't quite what they were looking for,"
21:14;21:18;"although they ended up putting this like at the real end of the credits,"
21:18;21:20;"which take like 10 minutes because there's so many animators."
21:20;21:22;"Second song on the credits?"
21:22;21:24;"The credits--no, it's like the fourth song."
21:24;21:28;"The credits are so long because it's like 10,000 animators worked on it."
21:28;21:29;"Oh, my God."
21:29;21:31;"This is my demo for Peter Rabbit."
21:38;22:01;"Trying to be playful."
22:01;22:02;"Yeah."
22:05;22:19;"A few references to the film."
22:19;22:21;"Nice."
22:24;22:26;"Ooh."
22:29;22:35;"This was originally the chorus,"
22:35;22:38;"but they said they needed a bigger chorus,"
22:38;22:40;"so I wrote this part."
22:46;23:03;"Try to get a high note up in there."
23:11;23:14;"French press and a blade of hay."
23:14;23:16;"That was one that I insisted on."
23:16;23:17;"That's great."
23:20;23:25;"[laughs]"
24:03;24:07;"I think one of the original lines I wrote was like--"
24:07;24:11;"♪ I love you, baby ♪"
24:11;24:14;"I always like ""I love you, baby"" in songs."
24:14;24:17;"They thought that wasn't quite right for Peter Rabbit."
24:20;24:26;"Love this demo, man."
24:26;24:29;"I was also--because they were using a lot of early vampire,"
24:29;24:33;"so I tried to go for an early vampire type chord progression."
24:36;24:39;"Ooh, is that you singing all those parts?"
24:39;24:40;"Yeah."
24:40;24:41;"Nice, dude."
24:41;24:43;"Although shout out to Greg Kirsten."
24:43;24:45;"We worked on the demo together."
24:45;24:48;"He did most of the arrangement of the backup vocals."
24:48;24:51;"So that was my little demo for Peter Rabbit."
24:51;24:54;"I referenced the wrong side of McGregor's Wall."
24:54;24:57;"I talk about carnivores because there's a fox,"
24:57;25:00;"and at one point I talk about Tiggy Winkle,"
25:00;25:02;"who is a porcupine character."
25:02;25:06;"Then we had to do a more pumped-up version for Peter Rabbit to sing."
25:06;25:08;"This is James Corden as Peter Rabbit."
25:08;25:10;"This is at the end of the movie."
25:10;25:12;"Everything's been resolved."
25:12;25:13;"It's all good."
25:14;25:15;"The couple came together."
25:15;25:18;"So this is the whole other song that you wrote."
25:18;25:21;"No, this is the movie version."
25:21;25:22;"Okay."
25:22;25:25;"So this is James Corden as Peter Rabbit, more pumped up."
25:25;25:27;"Oh, BPM."
25:27;25:29;"Yeah, BPM is kicked up."
25:29;25:35;"Slightly different lyrics, too."
26:06;26:24;"Here we go."
26:28;26:45;"More pumped up."
26:45;26:46;"I like it."
26:46;26:48;"Probably more appropriate for--"
26:48;26:49;"Sure, the end of the movie."
26:49;26:50;"Yeah."
26:50;26:53;"It reminds me so much of a Paul McCartney song."
26:53;26:56;"Well, no, the chorus that they made you to write,"
26:56;26:58;"that does remind me of Paul McCartney, Circa Revolver."
26:58;27:01;"The first two parts that you wrote remind me of--"
27:01;27:03;"Like when Paul would write--"
27:03;27:04;"Good Day Sunshine or something."
27:04;27:05;"Right."
27:10;27:28;"So you get the idea."
27:28;27:31;"Peter Rabbit came out, and immediately,"
27:31;27:34;"it was mired in controversy."
27:35;27:37;"I miss this."
27:37;27:38;"What happened?"
27:38;27:40;"There's a part in the movie,"
27:40;27:42;"and I should preface this by saying"
27:42;27:44;"I don't have any serious allergies."
27:44;27:46;"Nobody in my family does, so I don't know."
27:46;27:48;"Where is this going?"
27:48;27:49;"[laughter]"
27:49;27:52;"So basically, the film Peter Rabbit--"
27:52;27:55;"And I think when there first was a trailer,"
27:55;27:57;"some Beatrix Potter traditionalists"
27:57;28:00;"didn't like this fast-talking James Corden Peter Rabbit"
28:00;28:04;"because, you know, the books are very sweet"
28:04;28:06;"and kind of quiet feeling."
28:06;28:07;"And in this--"
28:07;28:08;"You know, he's this fast-talking guy."
28:08;28:09;"He's very self-referential."
28:09;28:11;"There's a lot of breaking the fourth wall."
28:11;28:12;"It's a postmodern--"
28:12;28:14;"It's a postmodern Peter Rabbit."
28:14;28:18;"At one point, Peter and the main human guy,"
28:18;28:21;"they get kind of in like a love triangle,"
28:21;28:22;"you know, rivalry thing."
28:22;28:23;"Okay."
28:23;28:25;"Wait, there's a human and a rabbit"
28:25;28:27;"after the same lady?"
28:27;28:30;"Well, the rabbit has like a crush on her."
28:30;28:31;"It's kind of like Rushmore."
28:31;28:33;"He doesn't have a chance, but he--"
28:33;28:35;"This is inappropriate for show."
28:35;28:37;"[laughter]"
28:37;28:40;"You can't have a rabbit lusting after a female woman."
28:40;28:42;"I think they handled it correctly."
28:42;28:43;"I don't know."
28:43;28:46;"But there's a part where he's watching--"
28:46;28:48;"He and his rabbit friends or family"
28:48;28:51;"are watching the two humans interact,"
28:51;28:53;"and he's watching with contempt"
28:53;28:54;"because he hates this guy."
28:54;28:56;"And to be fair, this guy's been trying to kill him"
28:56;28:57;"because this guy--"
28:57;28:59;"This is the new Mr. McGregor, and he hates rabbits."
28:59;29:01;"So Peter Rabbit is watching these two people fight."
29:01;29:02;"Yeah."
29:02;29:03;"He's watching them have a conversation."
29:03;29:05;"And he hears the guy say to her, you know,"
29:05;29:08;"she offers him a blackberry something,"
29:08;29:10;"and he goes, ""Oh, I'm very allergic to blackberries."""
29:10;29:12;"And then Peter Rabbit is up there and goes,"
29:12;29:13;"""Oh, my God."
29:13;29:15;"Everybody's allergic to something now."""
29:15;29:16;"Uh-huh."
29:16;29:18;"""Oh, really? You're allergic to blackberry?"""
29:18;29:20;"I mean, we've all heard somebody make a joke"
29:20;29:22;"about how everybody's allergic to gluten now."
29:22;29:23;"Sure."
29:23;29:25;"So it was a very kind of like L.A. type joke."
29:25;29:26;"And then one of his friends goes,"
29:26;29:28;"""Well, you know, Peter, some people have"
29:28;29:30;"very serious life-threatening allergies."""
29:30;29:32;"And then Peter-- this is all in the movie."
29:32;29:34;"Peter goes, ""Of course, of course."""
29:34;29:36;"And those people struggle and suffer,"
29:36;29:37;"and our heart goes out for them,"
29:37;29:39;"and we don't want to get any letters."
29:39;29:41;"So let me be very clear that some people"
29:41;29:42;"do have real allergies."
29:42;29:43;"This is in the movie?"
29:43;29:45;"This is in the movie because--"
29:45;29:46;"I like the sound of this movie."
29:46;29:47;"It's very-- yeah, like I said,"
29:47;29:49;"Peter Rabbit's always cracking jokes and stuff."
29:49;29:50;"Is this rated G?"
29:50;29:51;"I think so."
29:51;29:53;"So Peter makes this joke that he doesn't believe"
29:53;29:54;"this guy seriously has an allergy."
29:54;29:55;"Yeah, yeah."
29:55;29:56;"And then later in the movie,"
29:56;29:59;"they're fighting him kind of Home Alone style,"
29:59;30:01;"and they shoot a blackberry into his mouth,"
30:01;30:03;"and the guy falls to his knees"
30:03;30:05;"and has to administer an EpiPen to save himself."
30:05;30:08;"And the rabbits feel a little bit ashamed about it."
30:08;30:10;"But anyway, so when the movie came out,"
30:10;30:11;"there was briefly-- the first week it came out,"
30:11;30:13;"there was like a Boycott Peter Rabbit campaign"
30:13;30:16;"by the parents of children with allergies."
30:16;30:17;"Come on."
30:17;30:18;"Well, that's the question."
30:18;30:19;"I saw a lot of people--"
30:19;30:20;"Come on!"
30:20;30:22;"I saw a lot of people making that point,"
30:22;30:23;"and then I was thinking about it,"
30:23;30:25;"and I was like, ""Well, if your kid"
30:25;30:27;"was, like, deathly allergic to blackberries,"
30:27;30:30;"and then you're in a movie theater full of kids,"
30:30;30:32;"and you see a bunch of kids laughing about"
30:32;30:35;"somebody using an allergy against somebody,"
30:35;30:36;"that could be stressful."""
30:36;30:38;"It'd be uncomfortable, for sure."
30:38;30:39;"I don't think--"
30:39;30:40;"But that's it."
30:40;30:41;"Yeah."
30:41;30:42;"I mean--"
30:42;30:43;"I mean, being allergic to [bleep]"
30:43;30:44;"must be stressful."
30:44;30:49;"My wife is allergic to fish and nuts of all stripes."
30:49;30:51;"Almonds, peanuts."
30:51;30:52;"Oh, so you're--"
30:52;30:53;"No joke."
30:53;30:56;"We had an EpiPen scenario a few months ago."
30:56;30:59;"At a restaurant, there was--"
30:59;31:02;"You ordered the almond-crusted tilapia?"
31:02;31:03;"[laughs]"
31:03;31:06;"There was some, like, stupid almond dressing"
31:06;31:08;"on some Brussels sprouts, something dumb."
31:08;31:09;"Oof."
31:09;31:11;"First bite in, she was like, ""Uh-oh."""
31:11;31:12;"She feels her throat closing up,"
31:12;31:13;"the things of that nature."
31:13;31:15;"Yeah, and we just, like, got in an Uber."
31:15;31:16;"To the hospital?"
31:16;31:17;"Oh, yeah."
31:17;31:19;"She didn't have her EpiPen on her."
31:19;31:20;"Oh."
31:20;31:22;"That was kind of a harsh reminder to be like,"
31:22;31:23;"""You know what?"""
31:23;31:24;"Always roll with EpiPen."
31:24;31:25;"Roll with it."
31:25;31:31;"♪ ♪"
31:52;32:01;"♪ How should I know ♪"
32:01;32:04;"♪ Where you're gonna be ♪"
32:04;32:07;"♪ Where will I go ♪"
32:07;32:09;"♪ Before you tell me ♪"
32:09;32:11;"I just want to say one last thing about it."
32:11;32:14;"Like I said, the filmmakers tried to do a disclaimer"
32:14;32:17;"in the film about how allergies are serious."
32:17;32:19;"I guess what this just goes to show is,"
32:19;32:20;"like, with a kids' movie,"
32:20;32:23;"maybe there's only so much post-modernity..."
32:23;32:24;"Right."
32:24;32:26;"...you can get away with, so much ironic detachment."
32:26;32:27;"That's really for the adults."
32:27;32:28;"Yeah, exactly. It's like..."
32:28;32:30;"The kid's not gonna find that funny."
32:30;32:31;"Right."
32:31;32:33;"The kid's not gonna be like, ""Ooh, that's self-aware."""
32:33;32:35;"Yeah, exactly."
32:35;32:36;"So, you know, I can..."
32:36;32:38;"Like a 6-year-old being like, ""Wow."""
32:38;32:40;"""Were you upset about that allergy part?"""
32:40;32:41;"""Well, no, Mom."
32:41;32:43;"""Remember that really self-aware,"
32:43;32:44;"""breaking-the-fourth-wall moment"
32:44;32:46;"""where Peter Rabbit made a joke about how..."""
32:46;32:47;"Yeah, of course not."
32:47;32:49;"So, anyway, I can see why the filmmakers thought it was okay,"
32:49;32:51;"but at the same time, the reaction..."

51:00;51:03;"And the same might be true for you."
51:03;51:06;"So I think that's where you've got to really get into the architecture of, like..."
51:06;51:08;"How do I want to design this?"
51:08;51:10;"And also, maybe you guys could do that together."
51:10;51:13;"Like, this is her idea. You weren't a fan of it."
51:13;51:16;"But it sounds like one thing that's cool is that you're both invested"
51:16;51:19;"in trying to maintain the relationship afterwards."
51:19;51:21;"That's 100% correct."
51:21;51:25;"I think there's a decent chance that she doesn't hook up with anyone either."
51:25;51:28;"I think this might be a little bit of, like, I want some freedom, you know."
51:28;51:31;"And then it's easy to picture nothing happening."
51:31;51:34;"Are you going to keep following her on social media during the month?"
51:34;51:35;"Absolutely."
51:35;51:37;"I don't know."
51:37;51:39;"She's not a user of social media, really."
51:39;51:41;"She's very curated in her selection."
51:41;51:43;"So you've got to make sure that when you get back,"
51:43;51:45;"there's very strong ground rules"
51:45;51:49;"so that you guys can not end up having a conversation you didn't want to have."
51:49;51:51;"That's fair."
51:51;51:55;"I'd like to decide if you want to also partake in the open side of the open relationship."
51:55;51:58;"And it sounds like you have some hesitation about that."
51:58;51:59;"I do."
51:59;52:03;"Yeah, I don't like the idea of, you know, potentially leading someone on"
52:03;52:06;"and potentially, like, not being, you know, fully honest about--"

52:22;52:23;"[laughs]"
53:04;53:06;"Let's just do one last exercise."
53:06;53:06;"OK."
53:06;53:08;"Maybe you don't want to hook up with anybody,"
53:08;53:09;"and don't do it then."
53:09;53:10;"That's fine."
53:10;53:13;"You really don't have to just do it just to keep up."
53:13;53:14;"Why don't you just plan on-- it sounds"
53:14;53:14;"like you have hesitation about it,"
53:14;53:16;"so plan on not hooking up with anybody."
53:16;53:16;"Yep."
53:16;53:19;"Maybe you could just set some other goals for that month,"
53:19;53:20;"like sculpting your body."
53:20;53:21;"Yeah."
53:21;53:23;"Do you like to drink protein shakes and pump iron"
53:23;53:25;"and things of that nature?"
53:25;53:30;"I recently got into making a blueberry almond butter milk,"
53:30;53:31;"very simple shake."
53:31;53:34;"Dude, there's a lot of fat in that almond butter, though."
53:34;53:35;"Oh, I like it, though."
53:35;53:37;"It goes well with the blueberries."
53:37;53:38;"What do you recommend instead?"
53:38;53:39;"It was organic."
53:39;53:41;"You're going to want to use some coconut water,"
53:41;53:43;"a scoop of whey protein."
53:43;53:46;"Is this your one that got recommended to you?"
53:46;53:48;"This is the one that was recommended to me by the trainer."
53:48;53:52;"Just all I know is that almond butter with real fitness geeks"
53:52;53:55;"has a mixed reputation, because it's super caloric."
53:55;53:57;"TC just all over the place today."
53:57;53:59;"I honestly think you should really"
53:59;54:02;"set yourself a deep task for the month."
54:02;54:04;"I like the fact that you're not on some,"
54:04;54:06;"well, if she's open, then I have to be open, too."
54:06;54:06;"Forget that."
54:06;54:08;"That doesn't sound like that's your gem."
54:08;54:10;"I think for this month, you really"
54:10;54:12;"focus on health and fitness."
54:12;54:13;"Hell, yes."
54:13;54:14;"Is there any reason why you can't?"
54:14;54:15;"No."
54:15;54:16;"Do you have a gym membership?"
54:16;54:17;"No."
54:17;54:17;"Get one."
54:17;54:20;"I'm sure in Toronto, you could get a one-month trial."
54:20;54:20;"Oh, one month?"
54:20;54:21;"To Good Life?"
54:21;54:22;"Yeah, go to Good Life."
54:22;54:23;"And then--"
54:23;54:24;"Oh, Seifeld."
54:24;54:26;"I want you to get on the internet,"
54:26;54:29;"because first of all, exercise for most people,"
54:29;54:32;"or for a lot of people, it makes you feel pretty like--"
54:32;54:33;"gives you a real even keel."
54:33;54:35;"Like, when you're super stressed out,"
54:35;54:38;"and if you heard your girlfriend was hooking up"
54:38;54:40;"with another person in Amsterdam,"
54:40;54:41;"you'd be all crazy."
54:41;54:43;"But then sometimes when you really exercise,"
54:43;54:45;"it's almost like being a little bit high."
54:45;54:47;"Where, like when sometimes you're on drugs,"
54:47;54:50;"and you just think about all your problems, and you're like,"
54:50;54:51;"it doesn't matter."
54:51;54:52;"We're all just humans."
54:52;54:53;"We're all whatever."
54:53;54:55;"So I think I like this idea of using that month"
54:55;54:59;"to focus on a task, a self-improvement task,"
54:59;55:01;"and then having some very clear ground rules for when"
55:01;55:02;"she gets back."
55:02;55:04;"And also, the last thing I'd say is just like, OK,"
55:04;55:05;"so visualize."
55:05;55:08;"Nobody likes the idea of their significant other-- well,"
55:08;55:09;"I guess some people."
55:09;55:10;"It's actually-- it's a lifestyle."
55:10;55:11;"People are old."
55:11;55:12;"And so--"
55:12;55:12;"Some people do."
55:12;55:14;"You found out that your girlfriend"
55:14;55:17;"had a brief hookup on another continent with somebody else."
55:17;55:18;"What really changes?"
55:18;55:20;"Can you mentally get over that?"
55:20;55:21;"Do you think it's possible?"
55:21;55:23;"I feel very optimistic."
55:23;55:25;"I feel good, positive vibes."
55:25;55:27;"And you're going to feel even better"
55:27;55:28;"after that month of whey protein,"
55:28;55:31;"and lifting weights, and stuff?"
55:31;55:32;"I bet."
55:32;55:33;"It's like a meditation."
55:33;55:36;"It's like, you know, Jake always talked to that--"
55:36;55:39;"like the uncle being like, marriage is hard work."
55:39;55:39;"I don't know."
55:39;55:42;"There is something interesting about the intellectual"
55:42;55:44;"challenge, which we all forget from time to time."
55:44;55:47;"You know, like if you ever find that the pain or however"
55:47;55:48;"you feel about this is too much, then"
55:48;55:50;"you've got to prioritize your mental health."
55:50;55:51;"But there's also something interesting about saying,"
55:51;55:54;"like, OK, this is what this person is asking for."
55:54;55:56;"I'm going to try and see if I can roll with it."
55:56;55:57;"If I can't, that'll be sad."
55:57;55:58;"Breakups are sad."
55:58;56:00;"But if I can, who knows?"
56:00;56:02;"Maybe you'll find out that you're stronger than you think."
56:02;56:05;"That's kind of an interesting challenge, to be like,"
56:05;56:08;"can I roll with something that, you know, back in the day,"
56:08;56:11;"the average man could not even for a second imagine?"
56:11;56:13;"Can I roll with it and see, like, who knows?"
56:13;56:15;"Like, that's true inner strength."
56:15;56:19;"And then you also have the outer strength from that month."
56:19;56:20;"A buff diesel body."
56:20;56:22;"Yeah, make sure that you have that."
56:22;56:23;"And maybe you could also, I don't know,"
56:23;56:26;"take down some Oprah's Book Club books or something"
56:26;56:26;"in that month."
56:26;56:29;"Just really fill that month with self-improvement."
56:29;56:31;"They're on Jake's New Age playlist."
56:31;56:31;"Oh, so good."
56:31;56:33;"I was listening to it before you called."
56:33;56:36;"You just, like, get a little bit high, go to the gym late night,"
56:36;56:37;"get on the treadmill."
56:37;56:39;"Just like two hours of, like--"
56:39;56:41;"White Rainbow and Stephen Halpern."
56:41;56:43;"And you know what I love about this is, like,"
56:43;56:44;"you have a great attitude."
56:44;56:45;"You're a very supportive boyfriend."
56:45;56:48;"If for whatever reason, things are weird when she comes back,"
56:48;56:50;"then that's going to be sad."
56:50;56:51;"But at least you gave it a try."
56:51;56:54;"And you're also going to be so ready to hit the ground running"

57:11;57:11;"Yeah."
57:11;57:12;"Make it in April."
57:12;57:14;"It'll be one of the show's playlists."
57:14;57:15;"I don't know what the theme is."
57:15;57:18;"I guess it's perseverance, inner strength,"

57:30;57:32;"doesn't fully make sense to you."
57:32;57:34;"This relationship's 101."
57:34;57:36;"I'll admit, this is perhaps an extreme case."
57:36;57:39;"But I think you've got the best attitude possible, man."
57:39;57:41;"And I also wish both of you the best of luck,"
57:41;57:43;"because there might be some complicated emotions"

57:49;57:50;"All right, man."
57:50;57:52;"Thanks for calling, Kyle."
57:52;57:54;"Hit us with an email in a month or two."
57:54;57:55;"Let us know what happens."
57:55;57:56;"I'll give you an update."

01:02:02;01:02:05;"It's this kind of weird, like, last ditch effort"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"on the part of Diet Coke."
01:02:06;01:02:07;"Kind of their backs against the walls,"
01:02:07;01:02:08;"just trying to be like--"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"They're on the ropes."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"It's a very Don Draper selling cigarettes"

01:02:13;01:02:13;"Right."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"That's just kind of like, everybody"

01:02:16;01:02:17;"How do we sell this product?"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"And it's like, OK, so we got some of these poindexters"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"saying that cigarettes cause cancer."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Well, everybody's going to die."

01:02:36;01:02:37;"Even your kids are telling you what to do."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"And now you got some egghead scientists"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"telling you you can't smoke cigarettes?"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"That's one of the only things that got you through being"
01:02:43;01:02:44;"a POW."
01:02:44;01:02:47;"It's something that makes you think of brotherhood, freedom."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"That used to be your only taste of freedom"

01:02:58;01:03:03;"hit up the Time Crisis Twitter and sent us this from the UK."

01:03:07;01:03:07;"Delicious."

01:03:09;01:03:11;"You know what else makes me feel good?"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Athleisure."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Because it's comfy casual."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"Look, life is short."

01:03:37;01:03:40;"came across two identical commercials for the US"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"and British market."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"They really felt like Gillian Jacobs couldn't"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"deliver that message to the people of the UK."
01:03:48;01:03:53;"They should do regional ones, too, in the UK and the US."
01:03:53;01:03:53;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Like the southern one."
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Here's the thing about Diet Coke."

01:04:07;01:04:08;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:08;01:04:09;"It would totally work."

01:04:13;01:04:15;"Yurt it up, my friend."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"You want to run a marathon?"
01:04:16;01:04:20;"Well, that sure sounds hard, but--"
01:04:20;01:04:22;"Take it easy there, Pancho."
01:04:22;01:04:23;"Yeah."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"So anyway, the only difference with the UK version"
01:04:26;01:04:26;"is that she goes--"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"You feel good?"
01:04:28;01:04:29;"Athleisure."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"Athleisure."

01:04:32;01:04:33;"Look, life is short."
01:04:33;01:04:35;"What's athleisure?"
01:04:35;01:04:35;"Like softball?"
01:04:35;01:04:46;"No, athleisure is kind of like fancier jogging/yoga/athletic"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"plus leisure, meaning that a cool look that you maybe"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"back in the day would only wear to the gym,"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"now you can wear it to the restaurant for lunch afterwards."
01:04:54;01:04:57;"You know, like a nice pair of yoga pants and a cool hoodie"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"or some fly nets or something."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"I don't know why."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"I guess they just decided that would resonate more in the UK."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"Athleisure."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"You're not going to drink Diet Coke while you're exercising."
01:05:06;01:05:09;"Maybe the people in the UK had the brilliant insight"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"that they were like, what's something that's actually"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"popular now that's reminiscent of Diet Coke?"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"And somebody was like, I have an idea."
01:05:15;01:05:18;"It's like athleisure in it because it's"
01:05:18;01:05:22;"like used to be for like something healthy in it."
01:05:22;01:05:23;"Right."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"Right."
01:05:24;01:05:29;"But now it's like this thing for just mucking about, right?"
01:05:29;01:05:30;"So it kind of makes sense."
01:05:30;01:05:33;"It's like the person who's just like smoking a cigarette"
01:05:33;01:05:38;"on a park bench wearing tight black yoga pants, Nike fly nets,"
01:05:38;01:05:43;"and a very techie windbreaker just slamming a DC."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"And you're like, did you just come from the gym?"

01:07:39;01:07:42;"And so you always have that in the second fridge."
01:07:42;01:07:45;"How funny is that concept?"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"Second fridge in the garage."
01:07:47;01:07:48;"The like immaculate garage."
01:07:48;01:07:49;"Yeah."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"Did you have a second fridge growing up?"
01:07:51;01:07:51;"No."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"We did not."
01:07:52;01:07:53;"We had a chest freezer."
01:07:53;01:07:54;"In the garage?"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"In the basement."
01:07:55;01:07:56;"It was terrifying."
01:07:56;01:07:57;"Oh, really?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"Frozen meat."
01:07:58;01:07:59;"In the chest freezer."
01:07:59;01:08:00;"In the chest freezer."
01:08:00;01:08:01;"In the basement."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"No second fridge though."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"We only had one fridge."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"We were one fridge household."
01:08:06;01:08:08;"We're also one shower household."
01:08:08;01:08:09;"Growing up?"
01:08:09;01:08:09;"Yeah."
01:08:09;01:08:10;"We were for a while."
01:08:10;01:08:13;"And then in '87, my parents--"
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Got a second shower."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Yep."
01:08:15;01:08:18;"When I was 10."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Dave was five."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"A major development."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"In '87, man."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"But I totally remember--"
01:08:24;01:08:28;"it's like such a vibe when you go over to somebody's house"
01:08:28;01:08:29;"and the kid would be like, want a root beer?"
01:08:29;01:08:30;"You'd be like, OK."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"He's like, come with me."
01:08:32;01:08:32;"Yeah."
01:08:32;01:08:36;"So the other wing of the house, and you're like, what is this?"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"It was either be in the basement or the garage."
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And there are definitely kids where that was so gnarly."
01:08:41;01:08:43;"I guess this probably happens less as people become"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"somewhat more health conscious."
01:08:45;01:08:47;"But I feel like back then in the '90s,"
01:08:47;01:08:51;"it would be that the kids who would have these two fridge"
01:08:51;01:08:54;"households, it would be that the one is the kitchen, of course,"
01:08:54;01:08:55;"fridge."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"And then the other one was basically the soda fridge."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"And so sometimes you go down and these kids"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"would just be like sun-kissed."
01:09:02;01:09:04;"Just a cornucopia of soda."
01:09:04;01:09:05;"Yeah."
01:09:05;01:09:07;"I'm also wondering if there's somebody who's"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"shopping at Whole Foods once a week,"
01:09:09;01:09:10;"because that's what the family wants,"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"and they're trying to be healthy."
01:09:12;01:09:13;"But they drink so much Diet Coke,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"and they're just like, I'm not going"
01:09:15;01:09:17;"to drink whatever kind of bullsh-- soda"
01:09:17;01:09:18;"they have over at Whole Foods."
01:09:18;01:09:21;"So every time I'm about to roll to Whole Foods,"
01:09:21;01:09:24;"I always go to the second fridge, grab a Diet Coke,"
01:09:24;01:09:27;"and just like this parent just pounding a Diet Coke"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"that they brought from home in Whole Foods"
01:09:29;01:09:33;"as they shop for presumably organic foods."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"Love it."
01:09:34;01:09:37;"Wait, I'm still hung up on you guys having one shower."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"All the way through both you and your sister"
01:09:39;01:09:40;"graduating high school?"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Family of four, one shower."
01:09:41;01:09:42;"Family of four, one shower."
01:09:42;01:09:44;"There were three bathrooms."
01:09:44;01:09:44;"Whoa."
01:09:44;01:09:46;"But only one shower."
01:09:46;01:09:48;"So three crappers, one shower."
01:09:48;01:09:49;"Yes."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"So was that like a log jam in the morning on a weekday?"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"No, we would all wake up at different times."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Because my dad worked on movies."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"So he'd have random hours."
01:09:57;01:10:01;"He would have the 4 AM alarm and [BLEEP] like that."
01:10:01;01:10:03;"It was just like you and Emma in the morning."
01:10:03;01:10:05;"Yeah, my mom then would probably wake up at 6 or something."
01:10:05;01:10:08;"And then for me, school started at 8."
01:10:08;01:10:11;"So I was probably in the shower at 7, 45, straight up."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"Oh, really?"
01:10:12;01:10:12;"Uh-huh."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"I'm a late riser."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"Yeah, actually I have a memory that at one time"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"they redid the bathroom with the shower."
01:10:18;01:10:19;"So that one was out of commission."
01:10:19;01:10:22;"So my dad built a temporary shower in the basement."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"What?"
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Yeah."
01:10:24;01:10:25;"Very handy guy."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"I don't even remember how it worked."
01:10:26;01:10:30;"It was like you had to turn on this big, nasty sink"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"next to the washing machine."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"And he used a garbage bag--"
01:10:34;01:10:37;"He used pliers to turn the--"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"He created some sort of draining mechanism."
01:10:40;01:10:44;"And I think it involved just black garbage bags."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"And it worked."
01:10:45;01:10:47;"Sounds awesome."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"That was pretty tight, actually."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"You know, those basement shower days"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"were some of the best of my life."
01:10:52;01:10:52;"Yeah."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"At the time, as a kid, I felt, well,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"why can't I use the regular shower?"
01:10:57;01:10:57;"Come on, guys."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Can we wait it to renovate?"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"But looking back--"
01:11:00;01:11:03;"Scott's house has two showers."
01:11:03;01:11:05;"Brian's house has three showers."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"Anyway, TC Heads, we want to get some emails from you."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"We want to know how many fridges and how many showers"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"you had in your house growing up."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"How about now, fridge-wise?"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"What, at my parents' house?"
01:11:15;01:11:17;"No, no, at your spot."
01:11:17;01:11:17;"Oh."
01:11:17;01:11:19;"One or two."
01:11:19;01:11:19;"Three."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"Wait, fridges or showers?"
01:11:21;01:11:21;"Fridges."
01:11:21;01:11:26;"I have never had an abode with more than one fridge."
01:11:26;01:11:27;"Just you wait, man."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:28;01:11:28;"I'm saving up."
01:11:28;01:11:32;"I guarantee you, within the next five years--"
01:11:32;01:11:33;"Multiple fridges?"
01:11:33;01:11:34;"You're going to have a multiple fridge house."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"It's what I've been working for my whole life."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"It depends how the next Vampire album does."
01:11:38;01:11:39;"Yep, that's true."

01:22:38;01:22:42;"No. Oh, you're right. No. Okay. When you look it up on Google, it says just like the white wing dove."
01:22:42;01:22:43;"So you're right."
01:22:43;01:22:46;"It would kind of be deeper, my version, right? One wing dove?"

01:23:05;01:23:11;"And I know part of the backstory is that she met like Tom Petty's girlfriend or something, who is Southern."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"And she said, like, how long have you known Tom?"
01:23:14;01:23:17;"And so she said, well, I've known Tom since I was the age of 17."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"Oh, wow."
01:23:18;01:23:23;"And then Stevie misheard age of 17 as edge of 17."

01:23:47;01:23:49;"Limping on the ground."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Yeah, maybe it's something about,"
01:23:50;01:23:57;"cause a one wing dove can't fly, but a one wing dove can walk."
01:23:57;01:24:00;"I drag my ass to you."

01:24:21;01:24:25;"Baby, I'm a one wing dove."

01:26:53;01:26:57;"Also, it's funny that like I guess this is from the musical film,"
01:26:57;01:27:00;"and it's very possible that's the woman who sings it, Kiela Settle."
01:27:00;01:27:04;"Maybe she sings it in the film, but I like to imagine that actually in the film,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Hugh Jackman sings that."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"Does he?"

01:27:20;01:27:23;"He said he didn't want to see any damn elephants in his city,"
01:27:23;01:27:27;"and P.T. Barnum just like didn't know what to do, and he's like really depressed."
01:27:27;01:27:30;"But then he gets a bright idea about how he can save the circus."
01:27:39;01:27:42;"Dudes with like 19th century handlebar mouse."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"Right, just the thing."

01:27:53;01:27:54;"Oh, yeah, that would be great."
01:27:54;01:27:55;"That seems totally up his alley."

01:27:56;01:27:57;"Oh, my God."
01:27:57;01:27:58;"Of course."
01:28:03;01:28:05;"It's the 19th century."
01:28:09;01:28:14;"Can you imagine running a circus back then and just like without semi-trucks and like"
01:28:14;01:28:18;"transporting elephants like on trains and stuff?"
01:28:18;01:28:19;"It seems crazy."
01:28:19;01:28:22;"Yeah, and horse-drawn carriages and carts."

01:28:37;01:28:38;"What's her like big hit?"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"The Cuban one."

01:28:48;01:28:51;"So this is another song that we haven't heard yet on the Time Post."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"Oh, really?"
01:28:52;01:28:53;"Oh, it's not the same one?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"No, but it's from the same album."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Okay."
01:28:55;01:28:56;"It's called Never Be the Same."
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Whoa."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Oh, I've heard this song."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"I like this song."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Cool tones."
01:29:04;01:29:05;"This song's cool."
01:29:05;01:29:10;"Yeah, this is like some late '90s indie keyboard through distortion pedal."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Yeah."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Yeah, this is a great song."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"She does something pretty interesting on the pre-chorus."
01:29:49;01:29:50;"I love that."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"So cool and weird."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Yeah."
01:30:01;01:30:05;"The chorus is a little more stock pop, but I really like that."

01:30:14;01:30:15;"Yeah, it's vibey."
01:30:15;01:30:18;"It's kind of like three parts that don't really go together, but--"
01:30:18;01:30:20;"Maybe they're written separately."
01:30:20;01:30:22;"I'm surprised that song is that high."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"That's cool."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"She's popping."
01:30:24;01:30:28;"She and Charli XCX are about to open for Taylor Swift on some of her European tour dates."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"That's a great gig."
01:30:29;01:30:33;"Maybe Kyle's girlfriend will see some of those dates over there in Europe during her trip."

01:31:46;01:31:48;"No."

01:31:55;01:31:57;"That's silly."
01:31:57;01:31:59;"I didn't think literally they were singing about that."

01:32:24;01:32:25;"Maybach."
01:32:25;01:32:26;"Well, I don't know exactly."

01:32:29;01:32:33;"No, no, M-A-Y-B-A-C-H, like the composer, Bach."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"Oh."
01:32:34;01:32:35;"Maybach, some people say Maybach."
01:32:35;01:32:37;"Oh, wow, I have no idea."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"I don't have the first clue."
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Is it automotive?"
01:32:39;01:32:40;"Yes."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"You really never heard of a Maybach?"
01:32:42;01:32:43;"No."

01:33:07;01:33:09;"And I'm really out of my element here."
01:33:09;01:33:14;"I mean, I really thought to take--to get--to convert a Maybach--"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah, like a custom--"
01:33:15;01:33:16;"To do it right?"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"Yeah, yeah, to do it right."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"I don't know, 15 grand?"
01:33:19;01:33:20;"15?"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"I'm just totally guessing."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"I mean, a Maybach's a very expensive car."
01:33:23;01:33:24;"I bet it's more."
01:33:24;01:33:25;"More?"
01:33:25;01:33:27;"What's the story with that?"
01:33:27;01:33:29;"[laughter]"
01:33:29;01:33:31;"First of all, who makes Maybach?"
01:33:31;01:33:33;"Maybach."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"I mean, that's the name of the company."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"It's not a subsidiary of like BMW or something?"
01:33:37;01:33:39;"I mean, it could very well be."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"It could be owned by--"
01:33:40;01:33:41;"Mercedes?"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"Okay, I guess Mercedes owns them now."
01:33:43;01:33:46;"But originally it was its own company, also German."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"So I guess the parent company is now Daimler."
01:33:49;01:33:52;"Do you see those cars just like out on the street?"
01:33:52;01:33:55;"Yeah, like Beverly Hills."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"You got to come out to Beverly Hills more, Jake."
01:33:57;01:34:01;"Let's do lunch over at the Palms."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"I got some Beverly Hills spots."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"What are your spots there?"
01:34:05;01:34:09;"I don't know if I want to say them on air, but there's some places you'd really like."
01:34:09;01:34:14;"You know what TC heads waiting outside the spots in the Beverly Hills."
01:34:14;01:34:18;"Just some diehard TC heads flying in from overseas."
01:34:18;01:34:20;"What's a Maybach run?"
01:34:20;01:34:21;"That's a good question."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"How much does--"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"MSRP on the Maybach."
01:34:24;01:34:27;"With a starting under $190,000."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"Okay."
01:34:28;01:34:36;"The S600, okay, represents considerable value compared to the last Maybach models."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"The 57 cost about twice as much as the S600."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Oh, so it costs like almost--"
01:34:41;01:34:42;"Like 400 grand?"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"Yeah, 380."
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Something's going on if they're chopping the price in half."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"Okay, but I think the point is like--"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"I'm going out on a limb here."
01:34:50;01:34:55;"I don't have enough context for it, but I think the point of making a whole chorus about how you took the top off a Maybach is like,"
01:34:55;01:35:00;"not only am I rich enough to have this incredibly expensive car, I also do what I want with it."
01:35:00;01:35:08;"If I want to make this expensive car convertible, I'll spend even more money and I'll decrease the value by doing this."
01:35:08;01:35:09;"I just want to have fun."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"Arguably increasing the resale value because--"
01:35:11;01:35:15;"No, but collectors don't like aftermarket changes."
01:35:15;01:35:19;"You don't think Jay Leno would want to buy Jay-Z's converted Maybach?"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"Well, I think in the song, the Maybach belongs to Future."
01:35:22;01:35:23;"Okay."
01:35:23;01:35:26;"Unless-- it depends who's the narrator of the song."
01:35:26;01:35:30;"Jay Leno would definitely want to buy Future's retrofitted Maybach."
01:35:30;01:35:35;"Or maybe it's actually-- we should assume that it's DJ-- because the song is ultimately credited to DJ Khaled."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"It's his Maybach."
01:35:36;01:35:40;"I think Future took the top off, but it may not have belonged to him."
01:35:40;01:35:42;"You know, I took the top off your Maybach."
01:35:42;01:35:43;"It's like a surprise."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"Oh, I haven't-- yeah."
01:35:45;01:35:46;"Like as a gift or as like a stunt?"
01:35:46;01:35:47;"I haven't seen the video yet."
01:35:47;01:35:53;"Maybe it's like an Uptown Girl video where the whole thing takes place at a-- like a, you know, mechanics garage."
01:35:53;01:35:59;"And DJ Khaled pulls in and like Future-- or it's like Bruce Springsteen, I'm on fire."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"Like DJ Khaled comes in and is like, ""Hey, does anybody work here?"""
01:36:02;01:36:07;"And then Future's got like grease on his face, comes out wearing a jumpsuit from under a car."
