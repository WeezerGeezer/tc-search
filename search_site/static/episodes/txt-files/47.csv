00:00;00:09;"Five. Five dollar. Five dollar footlong. Today on Time Crisis we talk Subway,"
00:09;00:17;"their sandwiches, and their advertising. We also open up the fan mailbag and"

01:11;01:25;"Time Crisis. Crunchy edition. I'm in the studio eating some flaming hot Fritos."
01:25;01:31;"Now every time we come in there's just different weird snacks. Jake's here too."
01:31;01:35;"What's up dude? By crunchy I thought you meant hippie. Oh no it's like it's funny"
01:35;01:38;"it's the opposite of hippie. Yeah exactly. What are you munching on over there? A"
01:38;01:45;"modello and some ruffles cheddar and sour cream. Are those good? Eh. A little heavy on the"
01:45;01:52;"sour cream. Yeah. Like the fake artificial chemical sour cream flavor. Mmm. I never"
01:52;01:58;"eat chips. Yeah so I eat chips every two weeks. Yeah me too. Actually was like"
01:58;02:02;"pretty healthy today until now. What'd you eat? I went to the gym in the morning"
02:02;02:08;"and then I had a coconut based protein shake. What else was in that? It's very"
02:08;02:14;"simple because. Did you make it? No. No. I can't believe. Absolutely not. Of course not."
02:14;02:18;"Sometimes I work out with the trainer. Yeah. Because I'm really trying to get"
02:18;02:23;"diesel. Taking it to the next level and I don't know nothing about nothing so I'd"
02:23;02:27;"always leave and be like so I should I have like protein after this? Yeah man you"
02:27;02:30;"gotta have protein. Then I would go to just like a random smoothie place and"
02:30;02:35;"like let me get the protein crunch whatever. With the muscle milk? I would"
02:35;02:38;"just get something off the menu that sounded good and then I was telling him"
02:38;02:43;"about it and he's like bro you do not need all that junk. He's like next time"
02:43;02:47;"you go to the place and you tell them you grab the expensive coconut water and"
02:47;02:52;"you say mix this with ice chocolate protein and a banana that's it. And then"
02:52;02:58;"I started doing it and it definitely felt lighter and also like the smoothie"
02:58;03:04;"place that I go to it's like all these just diesel dudes. It's a really I always"
03:04;03:07;"feel like a little embarrassed going in there like. Like there's a lot of powders?"
03:07;03:11;"A lot of powder yeah all sorts of weird powders. There's one time when when the"
03:11;03:16;"guy was like do you want to add some glucosamine or something he's like you"
03:16;03:20;"can add one scoop of something else too and I was like $1.29 dude and he was like"
03:20;03:25;"really it's free and I was like I'm good and he was just like you don't want some"
03:25;03:29;"glucosamine. I don't even remember what it was. So I don't know what I'm doing but I"
03:29;03:32;"will say this so then I started going in there and I ordered this kind of like"
03:32;03:36;"off-menu thing over and over again and eventually one of the dudes real diesel"
03:36;03:42;"dude mm-hmm they all wear a matching polos which I love. Real diesel dude matching"
03:42;03:45;"polos ring me up one day he's like I guess they started to recognize me"
03:45;03:48;"because I just come in I became a regular. Like what twice three times a"
03:48;03:51;"week? Yeah probably like average of twice a week and when the guy said to me like"
03:51;03:57;"you know man I've been drinking your smoothie lately and I was like what and"
03:57;04:01;"he's like you always come in here order that coconut one I tried it and it was"
04:01;04:05;"it was pretty good and I was like oh man I was like well you know first of all"
04:05;04:09;"thank you. I was like oh man this dude told me to try it that's I don't have"
04:09;04:11;"any idea what I'm doing I was like but you found it was good and he's like yeah"
04:11;04:15;"and I was like all right cool guess I'm on the right path. That needs to be on"
04:15;04:24;"the menu board Ezra's. I want like a signed headshot of you eight and a half"
04:24;04:31;"by eleven glossy black. Just full body shot? Yep. In a tank top? Maybe VW shows next year"
04:31;04:37;"tank top dude. I've thought about it because really well it gets so hot on"
04:37;04:41;"stage you know like the clothes that I like the most I like sweaters long pants"
04:41;04:46;"right but back in the day I used to try to go out on stage in a sweater even no"
04:46;04:49;"almost no matter where you're playing unless you're playing outside in the"
04:49;04:55;"winter you get hot so quickly yeah so then I don't know like you know ideally"
04:55;04:59;"if you could actually put together an outfit with like a tank top shorts"
04:59;05:29;"socks and socks? Uh. As I sit in my b-boy stance. With flip flops and socks and sweat pants. I'm finna enhance your brain. Check it out. Once upon a time not long ago when the player from the point didn't have no flow. He hit me from my tennis shoes walking through the snow caught up in the slipping. But now I link it to the flow just like Marvin. Cause I got the heat in my blimmin mama name and I never"
05:29;05:41;"bragging just to say nah even when I was a young lad I learned my lesson never talk to strangers in the trap and ask them questions. The Pope and his folks got us under the scope but for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope that you distribute we don't contribute to your clandestine activity my"
05:41;05:52;"soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow but so is Carl Everor. You went behind my back like Ludo when he cut up all the poor. Two things I hate lies and things that make my blood pour. But we're constricted on my soul that they call the"
05:52;06:19;"wheels of steel. That show me how you feel. That's right the wheels of steel. That show me how you feel."
06:19;06:49;"It took your mama nine months to make it but it only took a 30 minutes to take it. Cut that croak clean up I did but I did so now safely. Don't want no A's no claps or no raise. We take no shit like I'm stocked up Camo's. Gotta collect all that unlocked up my votes. Low blow hit me in the left ventricle. We won't be able to ride out to 2004. But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve. Trying to take your other people for your rims. Hit your curve for your swerve and bust your forehead. Go ahead go ahead."
06:49;07:03;"Mo'head for me while you ride to the beat. Draw like tears like the beers. You know shout shout let it all out just for my peers and pupils who feel like it's time to unwind like December 31st 1995."
07:03;07:17;"I gotta tell you I came in here wearing some socks and sandals and Jake immediately said stocks and socks. Yeah. What is the stocks referred to? Birkenstock. Oh. Okay. That's like a real 90s look like. Stocks and stocks."
07:17;07:41;"I remember seeing this video of pavement playing a record in-store show in like 93 and Spiral Stairs is wearing stocks Birkenstocks and socks and shorts. And I was like that was kind of my look when I was like 15. And I was like this is amazing. You have nice. Yeah I have these like hipster Japanese Tiva-esque things."
07:41;07:57;"Picture that with like kind of. Yeah Birkenstocks. Like leather. Right. That's weird. With like a white athletic sock. Yeah that that's that's a rough look. That's tough. Although you could wear that with slides. You know like those like Adidas slides. Mm-mm."
07:57;08:15;"This is what people call those like the flip-flop with just like one large thing across the. Okay. Shower sandals. Didn't know that was the term. A lot of slides. Yeah. A lot of people wear those with socks. So yeah you with stocks and socks shorts and a tank tank top. I would love that. To not have to worry about it."
08:15;08:35;"Protein shake on stage. Do some push-ups on stage. It's really hard to like. Just go full Andrew W.K. slash Glenn Danzig. Like if you got super yoked that'd be such a weird. I don't think I can get yoked. No I don't think you can either. I don't think you have the genetic like it's just not who you are. It'd be tough. To get yoked. Like I couldn't get yoked either."
08:35;09:05;"You know most people so many people who are yoked also take like human growth hormone or steroids. Can you imagine. That might be what I have to do. That would be crazy if you did that. I might be stronger than I've ever been in my life. Dude. I don't know. I don't know if I'm dude. When we were at RALs like last week. Yeah. Two weeks ago. You did like three or four pull ups. And you realize that's an incredibly low number to like. No no no. For a gym rat. But no no. Yeah. But I don't think. I was fully extending. No dude. You were doing like balls to the wall pull ups. I can't do that."
09:05;09:35;"I could do one maybe. Pull ups are hard. A true pull up all the way down all the way up is hard. Not to be confused with a what chin ups. Oh wait what's the difference. When you're. So pull up is when your palms are facing. When your palms are facing out. Yeah. That's truly hard. That's harder. Much harder. Okay so chin up. That's what you were doing. I think we were doing. Maybe I was doing a chin up. Oh chin up is palms out. Pull up is palms out."
09:35;09:42;"So you're doing like palms facing towards your face. I don't remember if I was doing the easy one or the hard one. I don't know. Fitness is important man."
09:42;10:10;"Everyone's feeling pretty. Gets hot third in July. Though the world's full of problems. They couldn't touch us even if they tried. From the park I hear rhythms. Molly's heart's on the books. Tonight there will be a party. On the corner at the end of the block."
10:10;10:33;"I'm ready for you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. I'm so funny I told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. We'll be jamming and jamming and jamming and jamming."
10:33;10:58;"They want us to join the fighting. But our answer today is to let all our worries like a breeze through our fingers slip away. Peace has come through Zimbabwe. Third world's right on the one. Now's the time for celebration."
10:58;11:17;"Cause we only just begun. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. Ain't nobody ever told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. Ain't nobody ever told you that you."
11:17;11:33;"We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. Ain't nobody ever told you that you. We'll be jamming until the break of dawn. We'll be jamming and jamming and jamming and jamming."
11:33;11:46;"So, we got a hell of a show today man. What's on tap? Seinfeld 2000 has been hooking us up with the craziest guests. We got everybody from Kazzy David. Jonathan Wolf. Jonathan Wolf, composer of the Seinfeld theme."
11:46;12:00;"He got the guys, the composer and the ad man behind the five dollar foot long jingle. I'm not familiar with that. You know that jingle? I don't know it. Catchy as hell. You familiar with the restaurant chain Subway? Oh yeah."
12:00;12:16;"Founded in 1965 in New Haven, Connecticut. Oh really? It's from Connecticut? It's actually the largest chain in the world. It beat McDonald's. Yeah, because the overhead is way lower. Oh nice. You know, to open a McDonald's probably cost like a million dollars."
12:16;12:22;"Five. Five dollar. Five dollar foot long."
12:22;12:40;"Oh. You remember this song? No. Five. Five dollar foot long. Who does this remind me of? Beach Boys. It reminds me of Beach Boys. Kind of a weird chord change. But it also has a little like British thing. Makes me think of like some late blur. Like coffee and TV era blur."
12:40;13:01;"Anyway, we're going to talk to those guys, but we need to get talk to Seinfeld first because so you were really excited about. Wait, what? Yeah, why? Because well, first of all, this is weeks ago. Seinfeld was like really psyched about this. He's like, I might have a connection to the guys who wrote the five dollar foot long song."
13:01;13:19;"We're like, that's amazing. Let's make it happen. And then just a couple of days ago, because he's a big subway supporter. A couple of days ago, you get some weird news about the subway chain and specifically their advertising. Yeah. Do you guys watch the show? A Good Day L.A.? It's like the morning show. It's the Fox morning show. Nope. OK."
13:19;13:38;"Well, in the mornings, you know, I'll watch a little morning TV. You know, it's my news or whatever. Yeah. And the commercials come on. And, you know, it's your average subway commercial with the whatever the hell the teriyaki chicken or whatever they're they're hawking. With Fogel, right? No, no. He's he's in prison. Jared Fogel. OK. I know he's he's done."
13:38;14:07;"When you say subway and advertising, it's like conjures the worst association possible. Yeah, it's going to take decades. They've had a rough few years. Yeah. Fogel is going to be hard to shake. Anyway, whatever. I'm like not you know, I'm on my phone, whatever. It's like in the background. And then in the last like 10 seconds, I'm hearing the curb your enthusiasm music in the subway ad. And it's not they're not doing there's no Larry David integration. There's no reference to any. There's no zooms. It's not. It's just straight up."
14:07;14:37;"It's just like so this is just a subway ad and you just hear bump, bump, bump, but that just kind of roll. Can we listen to an example? Hey, look, it's everyone's favorite. The six dollar subway. Six. Now, six. Now, hey, look, it's everyone's favorite. The six dollar sweet onion chicken teriyaki. I was right about the advertising. They're footlongs and they're six bucks each subway. So much. I mean, that's messed up. That's brutal. Right. Well, OK. So first of all, that's really weird. Yeah. I've known for a while that the Caribbean enthusiasm."
14:37;15:04;"Music is library music, meaning that like, right. Anybody who makes a TV show or movie, they usually pay a fee to be members of a music library because, you know, you're you're editing together a TV show every time you want to get some music. You don't necessarily want to have a composer. Right. Do it from scratch. So as we know from talking to Jonathan Wolf, composer, the Seinfeld theme song, Jonathan Wolf was out of the game. He didn't want to score curb."
15:04;15:16;"Larry was very upset by this and said, you know what, I don't want you to score it anyway. And he just ended up using library music. So that means that that music you couldn't just go throw the Seinfeld theme in something."
15:16;15:35;"No, you need Steve Bannon's permission or whoever in Seinfeld. But that's library music. So anybody can use that. So Seinfeld, what Subway is doing, it's legal, man. It's to the letter of the law. It's legal. It's disrespectful, isn't it? I mean, once a piece of music gets so associated with a certain thing."
15:35;15:47;"And then, of course, and the curb is coming back in October. OK, guys. Right. So the timing is. Yeah, it's sus. It's very sus. Stealing the thunder anyway. Stealing valor."
15:47;15:57;"Core values. How do you feel about that, Jake? What do you think? Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a pathetic attempt to, you know, leech on to curb."
15:57;16:14;"Yeah, if you don't know curb and hear the music, it's sort of innocuous music. Right. You wouldn't even notice it. But then for the percentage of the population that knows curb and loves curb, I don't know what they're hoping that maybe there's some sort of subconscious reaction where you're sort of like you feel warmth towards Subway because you."
16:14;16:26;"What I think I don't know what they're going for. Subway has always portrayed themselves as like being like slightly ironic. Really? I think Subway is always like portrayed themselves having a sense of humor."
16:26;16:34;"But the Fogel campaign was like very sincere, like this man lost 300 pounds. But even that wasn't it wasn't there something like a little funny about the way they portrayed it?"
16:34;16:47;"I think that was very sincere, very aspirational. I'm just saying like McDonald's will do commercials where it's like McDonald's. This is where the only place your family actually loves each other, you know?"
16:47;16:57;"OK, well, so anyway, we're going to talk to these guys from Subway first and foremost. I don't want to be like gotcha by bringing up the curb thing. We're going to start out by showing them respect and talking about the five dollar foot long jingle."
16:57;17:04;"Coming up after this, we're going to get Jimmy Harned and Jerry Cronin, the guys behind the five dollar foot long song on the phone."
17:04;17:09;"I've seen your picture. Your name and lots of money."
17:09;17:18;"This is your big debut. It's like a dream come true."
17:18;17:25;"So won't you smile for the camera? I know they're gonna love it."
17:25;17:30;"I like your picture."
17:32;17:34;"I keep it with your letter."
17:34;17:38;"Done up in blue print blue."
17:38;17:43;"It sure looks good on you."
17:43;17:47;"And when you smile for the camera."
17:47;17:50;"I know I love you better."
17:50;17:57;"Hey, you'll come back to me."
17:57;18:01;"Hey, you'll come back to me."
18:02;18:07;"From the shore to far away. You'll see it all."
18:07;18:11;"It's your favorite foreign movie."

18:55;18:56;"the fresh delicious chicken pizzaiola."
18:56;18:59;"Five dollar footlongs all day, every day."
18:59;19:04;"- Now let's go to the time crisis hotline."
19:04;19:07;"(phone ringing)"
19:07;19:09;"- Hey Jimmy and Jerry."
19:09;19:10;"- Hi."
19:10;19:11;"- Hey there."
19:11;19:12;"- Hey, how are you doing fellas?"
19:12;19:14;"Thanks for calling in a time crisis."
19:14;19:15;"- How's it going?"
19:15;19:16;"- No problem."
19:16;19:18;"- Not bad, we've just been talking about"
19:18;19:21;"the famous five dollar footlong jingle."
19:21;19:23;"So Jimmy, you're the one who actually composed this."
19:23;19:25;"- That's right."
19:25;19:27;"- Jerry, you're kind of like the ad man behind it."
19:27;19:28;"Like how do you guys link up?"
19:28;19:30;"- We always liked Jimmy and his company"
19:30;19:31;"and Ray and all those guys."
19:31;19:33;"So we had music, we often used them"
19:33;19:36;"but they always did a good job."
19:36;19:37;"Simple as that, and they're nice people."
19:37;19:40;"- Jerry, you're the guy at the advertising agency."
19:40;19:42;"So Subway comes to you and they just say,"
19:42;19:45;"we've got this five dollar footlong promotion."
19:45;19:47;"What do you got for us?"
19:47;19:49;"- Yeah, it was kind of, you know,"
19:49;19:51;"Subway, they don't own any restaurants."
19:51;19:54;"Everything's franchised out and some guy in Florida"
19:54;19:57;"had an idea for selling all the stuff at five bucks"
19:57;20:00;"and he coined the name, five dollar footlong."
20:00;20:03;"So I mean, and that was, you know,"
20:03;20:07;"including all the research and the sales,"
20:07;20:08;"it just caught on for some reason."
20:08;20:11;"So we had to create a series of ads for it."
20:11;20:14;"It was, you know, it became a full billion dollar brand."
20:14;20:15;"Just grew huge."
20:15;20:17;"But so we had to do some ads for it."
20:17;20:21;"And so we had music, I mean, the direction was pretty open."
20:21;20:24;"It was just, because the name had such power,"
20:24;20:27;"at least I saw it, we asked Jimmy and the guys to,"
20:27;20:30;"you know, can you do something that mentions the name,"
20:30;20:33;"five dollar footlong, as many times as possible?"
20:33;20:36;"That was kind of the direction they had to go from."
20:36;20:40;"- So Jimmy, do you remember when you got hit up"
20:40;20:44;"by Jerry and the crew, did you get any other direction"
20:44;20:46;"in terms of tone or vibe?"
20:46;20:48;"- Jerry really said that we should sing it"
20:48;20:50;"as many times as we can, 30 seconds"
20:50;20:52;"before the announcer comes in."
20:52;20:56;"And other than that, his directive was really,"
20:56;20:57;"just make it cool."
20:57;21:01;"- I think one reason why people remember that jingle"
21:01;21:03;"is because there's a haunting quality about it,"
21:03;21:05;"because it has this, the chords are kind of unusual."
21:05;21:09;"It's kind of minor key and sad."
21:09;21:10;"Is that fair to say, guys?"
21:10;21:14;"- Yeah, it's actually, it's in C,"
21:14;21:17;"and I'm playing C major, and then I go to A flat, which is--"
21:17;21:18;"- Out of the key."
21:18;21:20;"- But they're both major chords,"
21:20;21:22;"but because of the way they interact,"
21:22;21:26;"it sounds kind of a little bit metal-y, I guess,"
21:26;21:27;"the way the melody goes down."
21:27;21:30;"But they're actually are, they're kind of major chords."
21:30;21:33;"They're just major chords you don't normally put together."
21:33;21:34;"- Yeah, exactly."
21:34;21:36;"I think because they're going out of the key"
21:36;21:37;"when you go to the A flat, to me,"
21:37;21:40;"it creates a kind of melancholic feeling."
21:40;21:41;"- Yeah."
21:41;21:42;"- They're like kinks or nirvana or something like that."
21:42;21:44;"- Yeah, I mean, so did you have,"
21:44;21:45;"yeah, to me, we were talking about it,"
21:45;21:47;"to us, it had a very British feel,"
21:47;21:49;"like this bittersweet British sound."
21:49;21:52;"We were throwing out the kinks, blur."
21:52;21:53;"Did you have any specific influences"
21:53;21:54;"when you were working on it?"
21:54;21:57;"- Not really, but I mean, the Ray Davies thing, for sure,"
21:57;21:59;"but it wasn't like I was listening to the kinks"
21:59;22:03;"that morning or anything, but I'm an acoustic guitar player,"
22:03;22:04;"and I just was working out the,"
22:04;22:07;"I was trying to work out the vocal harmonies"
22:07;22:10;"on an acoustic guitar, and it just seemed like"
22:10;22:13;"just having mostly acoustic and harmonies together"
22:13;22:15;"would be kind of a cool sound."
22:15;22:17;"- So Jerry, do you remember when you first heard"
22:17;22:18;"Jimmy's demo?"
22:18;22:21;"- Yeah, if I remember right, Jimmy,"
22:21;22:24;"you had like five, six, or eight of them even, didn't you?"
22:24;22:26;"- Yeah, we made a whole bunch of them."
22:26;22:29;"We made, yeah, six or seven of them anyway,"
22:29;22:31;"and I think there were a couple that we were,"
22:31;22:33;"you guys were liking, and we, you know,"
22:33;22:36;"it took a little while to narrow it down."
22:36;22:37;"- I think there was a couple we were liking,"
22:37;22:38;"but we only liked a lot more,"
22:38;22:41;"and everyone liked it, to be honest."
22:41;22:43;"You know, the thing that happened after was"
22:43;22:45;"all the people started, you know, on YouTube,"
22:45;22:47;"you know, creating their own versions of the music,"
22:47;22:50;"and re-recording it, and, you know,"
22:50;22:52;"it just kind of took off that way, too."
22:52;22:54;"- It kind of went viral at a time,"
22:54;22:57;"like this is very, this was 2008, right?"
22:57;23:00;"This is kind of like right at the cusp of when,"
23:00;23:03;"in advertising, everybody started talking about going viral,"
23:03;23:04;"and you guys just kind of happened to do it naturally"
23:04;23:06;"with a catchy piece of music."
23:06;23:08;"- Yeah, I mean, it wasn't that we, you know,"
23:08;23:11;"orchestrated it, not to be a pun,"
23:11;23:13;"but, you know, just people started really liking the song,"
23:13;23:16;"despite the fact that it's for a $5 sandwich,"
23:16;23:19;"they just really liked it, and doing their own versions,"
23:19;23:21;"and trying it different ways."
23:21;23:23;"There's dance versions, there's all kinds."
23:23;23:26;"- Did you guys find Death Metal Guy?"
23:26;23:27;"With the-- - No, is there a"
23:27;23:28;"Death Metal version of it? - With the fingers back there?"
23:28;23:30;"And he does like, he didn't even,"
23:30;23:32;"I didn't listen to the song well enough"
23:32;23:32;"to know the right chords,"
23:32;23:35;"he just kind of made up his own chords."
23:35;23:37;"If you can find Death Metal Guy, he was my favorite."
23:37;23:39;"- Oh, we'll definitely check that out."
23:39;23:40;"When you guys are working on this,"
23:40;23:43;"you're putting all this work into the $5 Footlong song,"
23:43;23:47;"I mean, surely, somewhere in the back of your mind,"
23:47;23:48;"were you both thinking, like,"
23:48;23:50;"we created this beautiful piece of music,"
23:50;23:55;"but we know that we live in a society with rampant inflation,"
23:55;23:59;"and these subs are not gonna be $5 forever?"
23:59;24:00;"Was that in the back of your mind?"
24:00;24:02;"- No, it wasn't, because, I mean,"
24:02;24:04;"you know, usually with a deal like that,"
24:04;24:05;"you think it's gonna last, you know,"
24:05;24:07;"three months or six months, it went for years,"
24:07;24:10;"and it honestly went to a $4 million brand,"
24:10;24:13;"it's just, until they couldn't, you know, justify it"
24:13;24:15;"because of the rising cost of food,"
24:15;24:18;"but, you know, I never thought it was gonna last that long."
24:18;24:19;"I don't think they did either,"
24:19;24:21;"and it just kept going on,"
24:21;24:22;"and, you know, they're getting, like,"
24:22;24:26;"you know, 20% increases monthly,"
24:26;24:27;"it just, it really took off."
24:27;24:30;"- This was like a tremendous growth period for Subway?"
24:30;24:31;"- Huge, huge growth period."
24:31;24:35;"It was, you know, they were at 20% monthly increase"
24:35;24:37;"in the month before, and the numbers,"
24:37;24:39;"and it just, it took off, it became the brand."
24:39;24:42;"- And wait, what was, was Jared around at that same period?"
24:42;24:44;"- I don't remember, Jimmy, do you remember,"
24:44;24:46;"he must've been in a couple scenes, wasn't he?"
24:46;24:50;"- I don't think he was in it for the first couple of years."
24:50;24:53;"They might've, they might've cut him in later on,"
24:53;24:54;"but they seemed to like,"
24:54;24:56;"it seemed mostly like you guys siloed that work,"
24:56;24:58;"like Jared had his spots,"
24:58;25:01;"and then the song stuff had its own spots,"
25:01;25:02;"as I remember. - Yeah."
25:02;25:07;"- I feel like Jared was specifically marketing six-inch subs"
25:07;25:09;"because his whole like aspirational diet thing"
25:09;25:11;"was based on..."
25:11;25:13;"- Yeah, you can't eat a foot long"
25:13;25:14;"if you're trying to lose weight."
25:14;25:15;"- Yeah."
25:15;25:17;"- No, I think he was a foot long guy."
25:17;25:19;"Well, that's like a terrible thing"
25:19;25:22;"when you're talking about Jared being a foot long guy, but."
25:22;25:23;"- I know, it's tough with Jared, yes."
25:23;25:26;"- Did you ever meet Jared?"
25:26;25:28;"- Yeah, we went out to dinner with him"
25:28;25:29;"tons and tons of times."
25:29;25:31;"- What was his vibe?"
25:31;25:32;"- Nerdy. - Yeah."
25:32;25:35;"- I hate to use the word, but kind of sweet and goofy."
25:35;25:37;"- He was like a 420 pound kid from, you know,"
25:37;25:39;"we just never quite fit in,"
25:39;25:42;"and all of a sudden took off because of some,"
25:42;25:43;"the sub thing."
25:43;25:44;"- It's crazy. - It's crazy."
25:44;25:47;"- Back to the $5 foot longs, do you guys eat Subway?"
25:47;25:50;"- Yeah, not, I haven't eaten in a while,"
25:50;25:53;"I'm trying to get away from bread, to be honest."
25:53;25:54;"- Fair enough, I think-- - Gluten-free."
25:54;25:57;"- Yeah, the whole world, that's definitely,"
25:57;25:58;"see, we're curious about that,"
25:58;26:00;"because Subway grew like crazy"
26:00;26:02;"since the period you're talking about."
26:02;26:03;"Jake was just telling me it's the number one chain"
26:03;26:05;"in the world that beat McDonald's."
26:05;26:07;"- It beats McDonald's a number of stores."
26:07;26:08;"- Oh, a number of stores."
26:08;26:09;"- Number of locations. - Not revenue."
26:09;26:11;"- No, not revenue, just number of stores,"
26:11;26:14;"and you know, and McDonald's owns all this great property,"
26:14;26:18;"and a lot of Subways are in strip malls and so forth."
26:18;26:20;"- Is Subway's tremendous growth period"
26:20;26:22;"gonna slow down in this kind of anti-bread era?"
26:22;26:24;"- I don't know where it is right now,"
26:24;26:27;"but I know that after $5 foot long,"
26:27;26:29;"that, you know, sales got what they like to call flat,"
26:29;26:31;"you know, it's hard to maintain that."
26:31;26:33;"- Well, I just got a question for you guys,"
26:33;26:36;"as people who are both parts of an iconic Subway campaign."
26:36;26:37;"If Subway came to you and said,"
26:37;26:38;"""Guys, sales are flattening,"
26:38;26:40;"""we're worried they're gonna start going backwards"
26:40;26:41;"""because people hate bread."
26:41;26:44;"""Now, what can we do?"""
26:44;26:46;"What's the first thing that comes to you guys' mind?"
26:46;26:48;"- Some people used to show up at Subway"
26:48;26:50;"and ask them to pull out as much of the bread"
26:50;26:52;"inside of the Sub roll, you know?"
26:52;26:55;"- Oh, like scoop it out? - Yeah, just scoop it out."
26:55;26:57;"You know, there's some chains that, you know,"
26:57;26:59;"instead of using bread, they just wrap it all in lettuce"
26:59;27:02;"and put it in kind of a packaging"
27:02;27:04;"that makes it easy to devour."
27:04;27:05;"- I like that."
27:05;27:08;"That's pretty smart, actually, the lettuce."
27:08;27:09;"Five dollar lettuce wrap."
27:09;27:13;"That doesn't exactly roll off the tongue."
27:13;27:13;"Well, thanks so much, guys."
27:13;27:15;"That was really fascinating,"
27:15;27:17;"and hopefully you guys can call in again."
27:17;27:18;"I'd love to pick your brain"
27:18;27:20;"about some of the other big campaigns,"

34:53;34:55;"or something, go, ""But don't take my word for it."""
34:55;34:57;"Or something like that."
34:57;34:57;"And then there'd be,"
34:57;35:01;"it was this funny part where kids would do book reviews."
35:01;35:02;"- Oh wow."
35:02;35:04;"- Like so a kid would be like,"
35:04;35:07;"it's a little bit like a Vanessa Bayer character from SNL,"
35:07;35:09;"where it'd be like a five-year-old who'd be like,"
35:09;35:12;"""The Hungry Caterpillar by na-na-na-na-na-na."
35:12;35:14;"""In this book, a caterpillar blah-blah-blah,"
35:14;35:16;"""but that's not all."
35:16;35:19;"""Da-na-na-na-na-na, because then the caterpillar blah."
35:19;35:22;"""I read the book, but my brother wanted to hear it twice."
35:22;35:23;"""Na-na-na-na-na-na."
35:23;35:25;"""Check it out."""
35:25;35:28;"Every episode would have two book reviews from kids."
35:28;35:28;"- Wow."
35:28;35:31;"- This week, my favorite book is Bangtan's Xenom"
35:31;35:33;"by Dr. Seuss."
35:33;35:36;"You know, just like that kind of awkward child acting."
35:36;35:37;"- Yeah."
35:37;35:38;"Half-hour episodes?"
35:38;35:39;"Like what would the episode be?"
35:39;35:40;"I don't even,"
35:40;35:41;"I don't remember. - Like alphabet stuff?"
35:41;35:42;"Like Sesame Street style?"
35:42;35:43;"Like, A."
35:43;35:45;"- There were a lot of different,"
35:45;35:47;"yeah, he would talk about books."
35:47;35:51;"They would do some outside the studio stuff."
35:51;35:52;"- I don't know why I don't know this,"
35:52;35:54;"'cause I watched Sesame Street."
35:54;35:55;"- Yeah, you know, honestly."
35:55;35:58;"- And if it debuted in '83, it's like right in my wheelhouse."
35:58;36:00;"- This is what the kids would sound like on the show."
36:00;36:03;"- How would you like a board game at home"
36:03;36:05;"whose characters come to life?"
36:05;36:06;"Picture this."
36:06;36:08;"Rhinoceros is stampeding your living room."
36:08;36:12;"An eight-foot python wrapped around your fireplace."
36:12;36:15;"Huh, why not try Jumanji?"
36:15;36:17;"The story is about--"
36:17;36:20;"- The kids are literally making a pitch for a book."
36:20;36:22;"Why not try Jumanji?"
36:22;36:24;"It's like, you know what, Vanessa Bear,"
36:24;36:25;"you know who I'm talking about?"
36:25;36:27;"- I think I do, yeah."
36:27;36:28;"- She was great."
36:28;36:29;"She recently left SNL,"
36:29;36:31;"but I thought she was so brilliant."
36:31;36:33;"Like, she would do these characters on Weekend Update"
36:33;36:35;"that often would be like,"
36:35;36:37;"one was like a child actress,"
36:37;36:39;"and one was like a bar mitzvah boy,"
36:39;36:43;"and they both, she nailed that kind of like funny,"
36:43;36:46;"like kid trying to like--"
36:46;36:47;"- Like trying so hard."
36:47;36:49;"- 'Cause it really is such a specific rhythm."
36:49;36:52;"And da na na na, hi, my name is da na na."
36:52;36:53;"- The three bears."
36:53;36:57;"This is a story that everyone knows,"
36:57;37:01;"but it's told in a funny new way."
37:01;37:03;"- This is a story that everyone knows."
37:03;37:04;"It's like, it's the rhythm of children's TV."
37:04;37:07;"- Do you think like kids like 10,000 years ago"
37:07;37:08;"talked that way?"
37:08;37:09;"- Well, no, this is something,"
37:09;37:10;"this is not even how kids talk."
37:10;37:11;"- I'm hungry."
37:11;37:12;"- No, this is how,"
37:12;37:14;"this is kids trying to be professional."
37:14;37:15;"So they're kind of doing a very,"
37:15;37:17;"it's not like a normal kid."
37:17;37:18;"Like normal kids are all like shy,"
37:18;37:20;"like little kids is like."
37:20;37:25;"- But there must have been kids that were like performers."
37:25;37:29;"- I don't know, maybe like young princes and princesses."
37:29;37:31;"- Just that cadence."
37:31;37:35;"- Father, my name is down, anyway."
37:35;37:36;"So that's the show Reading Rainbow."
37:36;37:38;"It was about reading."

41:00;41:02;"- Should we get into some listener emails?"
41:02;41:03;"- I'm in."
41:03;41:05;"- First of all, I just wanna say"
41:05;41:09;"that Jake always forwards me the listener emails."
41:09;41:12;"And even though we don't reference everyone on air,"
41:12;41:13;"- We read them all. - We read them all."
41:13;41:15;"And we really do appreciate them all."
41:15;41:16;"- Get like one or two a day."
41:16;41:19;"- That's pretty good. - Which is pretty solid."
41:19;41:20;"- That's solid. - Yeah."
41:20;41:22;"- The Time Crisis fan base."
41:22;41:23;"- Holding it down."
41:23;41:24;"- It's holding it down."
41:24;41:25;"- Time Crisis."
41:25;41:27;"- This is an interesting one."
41:27;41:30;"This one's from Adreja Chakrabarti."
41:30;41:32;"Forgive me if I'm mispronouncing your name."
41:32;41:35;"She writes, ""Dear Mr. Longstreth,"
41:35;41:37;"""I like the formality."
41:37;41:39;"""I deeply apologize for intruding"
41:39;41:41;"""what appears to be your business email,"
41:41;41:43;"""but after listening to a recent episode of Time Crisis,"
41:43;41:46;"""I feel this is worthy of sharing to you and Mr. Koenig."
41:46;41:48;"""Also, this may provide some more youth input to the show,"
41:48;41:49;"""which seems to be something"
41:49;41:51;"""you guys have been looking for lately."
41:51;41:52;"""My name is Adreja,"
41:52;41:56;"""and I'm a 17-year-old musician from Vancouver, Canada."
41:56;41:58;"""To be specific, I live in a suburb"
41:58;42:00;"""of Metro Vancouver called Surrey,"
42:00;42:03;"""like Harry Potter's number four Privet Drive, Surrey."""
42:03;42:03;"That's interesting."
42:03;42:05;"Vancouver's a cool town."
42:05;42:06;"I feel like being from a suburb of Vancouver"
42:06;42:07;"is probably pretty cool."
42:07;42:09;"- Shout out to Nick Kerkovich."
42:09;42:11;"- Oh, Vancouver guy. - Yep."
42:11;42:12;"- For the past few years,"
42:12;42:15;"an EDM festival called Faded in the Park."
42:15;42:16;"Great name."
42:16;42:17;"- What does that even mean?"
42:17;42:18;"- Well, you know, like faded,"
42:18;42:19;"like when you get faded,"
42:19;42:20;"it means like you're drunk or high."
42:20;42:21;"- I know, but it's weird"
42:21;42:23;"that there'd be a festival that like--"
42:23;42:25;"- Also be-- - Specifically condones--"
42:25;42:27;"- It's called like, also it's funny because like--"
42:27;42:28;"- Like hammered."
42:28;42:31;"- EDM festivals are always getting in so much trouble"
42:31;42:35;"for like people dying on drugs or alcohol or whatever."
42:35;42:35;"So it's really funny"
42:35;42:37;"just to basically call a festival called like,"
42:37;42:38;"(beep) up in the park."
42:38;42:40;"- Yeah, hammered on the highway."
42:40;42:42;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
42:42;42:48;"- AC/DC and Whitesnake touring,"
42:48;42:50;"hammered on the highway."
42:50;42:51;"- MDMA in the bay."
42:51;42:54;"(laughs)"
42:54;42:56;"- That's a Bay Area festival."
42:56;42:57;"- Mali and Bali."
42:57;43:00;"(laughs)"
43:00;43:02;"- So there's an EDM festival called Faded in the Park"
43:02;43:04;"and it's found its home in our beloved city."
43:04;43:06;"Surrey has never been known for its music."
43:06;43:07;"If we wanna play at an open mic,"
43:07;43:09;"we need to trek out two hours to cooler places"
43:09;43:11;"like downtown Vancouver or Gastown."
43:11;43:13;"- Well, that's confusing."
43:13;43:14;"- Okay, so I guess maybe--"
43:14;43:16;"- 'Cause she, wait, she says that--"
43:16;43:17;"- Well, she says it's a suburb,"
43:17;43:17;"but she's a distant suburb, I guess."
43:17;43:18;"- That's two hours."
43:18;43:20;"- Well, yeah, that's if it could be."
43:20;43:21;"If that's the biggest city,"
43:21;43:22;"we might still call it a very distant suburb, I guess."
43:22;43:23;"- Jeez."
43:23;43:25;"- When commercial billboard charting artists"
43:25;43:27;"such as Drake, Justin Bieber, Rihanna come to our area,"
43:27;43:28;"they don't come to Surrey,"
43:28;43:30;"they come to Rogers Arena in Vancouver."
43:30;43:33;"- Rogers Arena, pretty classy name."
43:33;43:34;"- Yeah, Rogers is--"
43:34;43:37;"- Not exactly, you know, Office Depot Arena."
43:37;43:39;"- Yeah, no, no, but first of all,"
43:39;43:41;"Rogers is like a cell phone company, right?"
43:41;43:42;"- Oh, really?"
43:42;43:44;"Okay, well, that's one of the names that just works."
43:44;43:44;"- You know what, man?"
43:44;43:47;"You hear this old WASP-y name like Rogers"
43:47;43:50;"and you're like, that sounds like a good man."
43:50;43:51;"That's a good man."
43:51;43:52;"- I don't think it's a good man."
43:52;43:55;"What I'm saying is it's not egregiously some brutal brand."
43:55;43:58;"Turns out it is, but some names."
43:58;44:03;"- Why, because an old WASP-y guy named Rogers"
44:03;44:05;"is so much classier than a young corporate chain"
44:05;44:07;"called Office Depot, man?"
44:07;44:10;"- What I'm saying is Rogers gives it room to breathe."
44:10;44:13;"- Get on the mic!"
44:13;44:14;"- I just wanna say--"
44:14;44:16;"- We're letting CYPHER2000 on the mic more often."
44:16;44:18;"- As a Canadian, I appreciate that."
44:18;44:21;"Look, just wanna put it out there as a Canadian"
44:21;44:25;"that Rogers is the most awful company in Canada."
44:25;44:26;"- What is it?"
44:26;44:28;"- It's a telecommunications company."
44:28;44:33;"It's like Canada's AT&T, and it is famously horrible."
44:33;44:36;"Their customer service, it's across the board."
44:36;44:38;"- Oh, yes, so horrible that they're out there"
44:38;44:41;"supporting arenas for you guys to see good music in."
44:41;44:42;"- The thing about that arena is"
44:42;44:44;"it used to be called the Sky Dome,"
44:44;44:45;"and it's associated with--"
44:45;44:47;"- No, the Sky Dome's in Toronto."
44:47;44:48;"- Yeah, that's what we're talking about."
44:48;44:49;"- No, no, no, Vancouver."
44:49;44:50;"- Oh, they have one too."
44:50;44:52;"- No, first of all, that's what's hilarious."
44:52;44:54;"Rogers has so many tentacles all over"
44:54;44:56;"the fine country of Canada that it's like,"
44:56;44:58;"Rogers Arena here, Rogers Arena there."
44:58;44:59;"- Oh, I didn't even know that."
44:59;45:00;"Oh, (beep) Rogers."
45:00;45:01;"- That's even worse."
45:01;45:02;"- Oh my gosh."
45:02;45:03;"- I hate all Rogers."
45:03;45:05;"- Okay, so I'm thinking about the Toronto,"
45:05;45:06;"I forgot about the Vancouver thing."
45:06;45:09;"- Also, can I point out, CYPHER2000,"
45:09;45:11;"really dropping some biographical details here."
45:11;45:12;"I think people would be surprised"
45:12;45:13;"to learn that you're Canadian."
45:13;45:14;"- Wait a second."
45:14;45:15;"- What's the Sky Dome?"
45:15;45:16;"- You have a lot of secrets."
45:16;45:17;"- Is that where Blue Jays played?"
45:17;45:18;"- Yeah, it is."
45:18;45:19;"- The Sky Dome."
45:19;45:20;"- Yeah."
45:20;45:20;"- Is it now called Rogers?"
45:20;45:21;"- It's called Rogers Center."
45:21;45:22;"- It's no longer called the Sky Dome?"
45:22;45:25;"- It hasn't, no, since like '04 or '05 or something."
45:25;45:27;"- Okay, so Seinfeld, you're born and raised in Toronto."
45:27;45:28;"- Not exactly."
45:28;45:30;"- Okay, whatever, you're born and raised in--"
45:30;45:31;"- Eastern Canada."
45:31;45:32;"- Eastern Canada."
45:32;45:35;"And so for you, there's this iconic place, the Sky Dome."
45:35;45:37;"You're a little kid and you're just like,"
45:37;45:38;"""Mommy, Daddy, one day I wanna go see"
45:38;45:40;"""the Blue Jays play at the Sky Dome."""
45:40;45:41;"And then you grow--"
45:41;45:42;"- Watch Kelly Gruber."
45:42;45:44;"- And then you grow and every day,"
45:44;45:45;"you look at your (beep) Rogers phone,"
45:45;45:47;"you're like, ""This service sucks."
45:47;45:49;"""The customer service is horrible."""
45:49;45:50;"- ""Why did they bill me twice this month?"""
45:50;45:52;"- They're billing you twice."
45:52;45:54;"They're probably not giving back enough taxes"
45:54;45:56;"to give you free healthcare and things like that."
45:56;45:59;"And now they throw their name on your beloved Sky Dome."
45:59;46:01;"Okay, I'm with you, that sucks."
46:01;46:02;"- It's funny that a cell phone company's name"
46:02;46:04;"is just a name, Rogers."
46:04;46:05;"- Yeah."
46:05;46:07;"- We have T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon."
46:07;46:08;"- Yes, they've got your--"
46:08;46:11;"- Imagine if we just had like, had like Bob's."
46:11;46:12;"Bob's Cell Phones."
46:12;46:14;"- It's Ted Rogers, the guy."
46:14;46:15;"- You know, Ted Rogers."
46:15;46:16;"It's even funnier though."
46:16;46:18;"Okay, Rogers is his last name."
46:18;46:21;"It's even funnier if you picture it being R-O-T-E-R,"
46:21;46:22;"apostrophe S."
46:22;46:24;"Rogers Telecom."
46:24;46:28;"Rogers speaking."
46:28;46:29;"Founded at Edmonton in 1982."
46:29;46:30;"- Yeah."
46:30;46:32;"- Built it from the ground up."

47:21;47:24;"- So back to this."
47:24;47:25;"Okay, so this is pretty interesting."
47:25;47:27;"I like this."
47:27;47:30;"So she lives in Surrey, two hours outside of the nearest city"
47:30;47:31;"and your city's Vancouver."
47:31;47:32;"So she's a musician."
47:32;47:34;"She wants to go to open mic night."
47:34;47:37;"She's jumping in the car for two hours"
47:37;47:40;"heading into the city."
47:40;47:43;"And then so she wants to see Drake, Bieber, Rihanna."
47:43;47:44;"She and her friends are driving"
47:44;47:47;"into Rogers Arena in Vancouver."
47:47;47:49;"So that's pretty funny to live two hours outside of a city"
47:49;47:51;"and be into music."
47:51;47:53;"And then suddenly you just like out of nowhere,"
47:53;47:55;"they're like EDM festival faded in the park,"
47:55;47:57;"I'm in a Surrey."
47:57;47:58;"That's pretty wild."
47:58;48:03;"So anyway, I go on with her email."
48:03;48:05;"Faded as it is affectionately called,"
48:05;48:07;"takes place in a park across the Skytrain station"
48:07;48:08;"where all the druggies hang out"
48:08;48:10;"and has been a running joke,"
48:10;48:13;"mainly because of its underwhelming slash tasteless lineups"
48:13;48:14;"and frat like atmosphere"
48:14;48:16;"in a Costco loving soccer mom suburb like Surrey."
48:16;48:18;"However, the tables have now turned."
48:18;48:23;"This year, the chain smokers are headlining the festival."
48:23;48:26;"It's understandable that the tasteful palette of 70s rock,"
48:26;48:27;"thank you, Jake,"
48:27;48:29;"may not resonate with a lot of today's youth,"
48:29;48:31;"but Faded is not a festival about bringing people together"
48:31;48:33;"for their love of any type of music for that matter."
48:33;48:36;"For example, I remember taking the Skytrain last year"
48:36;48:37;"and overhearing attendees talk"
48:37;48:40;"about how they have no idea who Zedd and Jack you are,"
48:40;48:41;"the headliners."
48:41;48:42;"The chain smokers,"
48:42;48:45;"arguably the most popular mainstream artists of 2017"
48:45;48:47;"are headlining a music festival five minutes from my house"
48:47;48:50;"where attendees care about anything but music."
48:50;48:51;"What does this say about the current state"
48:51;48:53;"of mainstream pop music and its consumers?"
48:53;48:54;"Has it always been this way?"
48:54;48:56;"I.e. the most popular artists of the year"
48:56;48:57;"playing a music festival,"
48:57;49:01;"which has never ever, ever been about music, like at all."
49:01;49:02;"I'm just putting this out there"
49:02;49:03;"and I don't know if you guys will ever read this,"
49:03;49:05;"but it'd be cool to know that you guys have."
49:05;49:08;"Love from a fellow Time Crisis fan."
49:08;49:12;"I just like love the image of just like being in a small town"
49:12;49:13;"two hours outside of Vancouver."
49:13;49:14;"- Yeah."
49:14;49:16;"- And the chain smokers are gonna be playing"
49:16;49:17;"like five minutes from your house."
49:17;49:19;"That just sounds like an 80s movie,"
49:19;49:21;"aside from the chain smokers."
49:21;49:25;"Just like, man, so boring living in this suburb."
49:25;49:27;"And then just like suddenly it's like"
49:27;49:29;"the town wins like a contest and they're like,"
49:29;49:30;"- Van Halen's playing."
49:30;49:33;"- Van Halen's playing five minutes from my house."
49:33;49:35;"Okay, so I guess she's saying."
49:35;49:36;"- People are there to party."
49:36;49:37;"- People are there to party."
49:37;49:38;"They don't care about the chain smokers."
49:38;49:39;"Which has been like a running question we've had."
49:39;49:41;"- Yeah, like other real heads."
49:41;49:44;"- As much as we respect the chain smokers artistry,"
49:44;49:46;"and they're huge, sometimes it's weird."
49:46;49:48;"Sometimes these really, really big artists"
49:48;49:51;"just don't have dedicated fans."
49:51;49:53;"- Like if they played like the Will Turn,"
49:53;49:56;"which is capacity like 2,500 or something,"
49:56;49:58;"they'd sell it out."
49:58;49:59;"But like what?"
49:59;50:02;"- Could they sell at the Staples Center?"
50:02;50:03;"- You have to assume."
50:03;50:06;"Imagine that chain smokers playing like the Troubadour."
50:06;50:08;"Like what would that vibe be?"
50:08;50:09;"- It wouldn't make any sense for them to play the Troubadour."
50:09;50:11;"- It would make no sense."
50:11;50:12;"- I mean, you know, whatever."
50:12;50:14;"- Chain smokers headlining FYF."
50:14;50:16;"- They played SNL, you know,"
50:16;50:18;"they'd have some backing tracks, some live people,"
50:18;50:19;"and the guy would sing."
50:19;50:20;"It'd be fine."
50:20;50:21;"- Yeah."
50:23;50:49;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
50:53;50:56;"So Jake, obviously this is not the same thing"
50:56;50:59;"as the Gigi's situation, 'cause you live in LA,"
50:59;51:02;"but how do you feel knowing that over this weekend,"
51:02;51:03;"the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac"
51:03;51:05;"played five minutes from your house?"
51:05;51:08;"- I feel surprisingly little about that."
51:08;51:09;"Here's my vibe."
51:09;51:11;"I don't like big shows."
51:11;51:12;"- Yeah."
51:12;51:14;"- The Roger Waters show was great."
51:14;51:15;"- 'Cause it was a big spectacle?"
51:15;51:16;"- It was fun."
51:16;51:17;"- Yeah."
51:17;51:18;"- The visuals were on point."
51:18;51:20;"Just getting into that Roger Waters show"
51:20;51:21;"was such a nightmare."
51:21;51:25;"If I was just like paying like 200 bucks to see the Eagles,"
51:25;51:27;"that's just not a good time."
51:27;51:29;"That does not sound fun."
51:29;51:32;"- I know that some of the tickets for this Eagles,"
51:32;51:33;"and also like Earth, Wind, and Fire and the Doobies"
51:33;51:35;"were playing that night."
51:35;51:36;"- That sounds awful."
51:36;51:40;"I mean, I really like some Eagles songs,"
51:40;51:42;"and I love Fleetwood Mac."
51:42;51:44;"- You wouldn't shell out $1,800?"
51:44;51:46;"(laughing)"
51:46;51:47;"- For the weekend?"
51:49;51:50;"- I think legitimately, I heard that--"
51:50;51:51;"- That is so cheap."
51:51;51:53;"- I don't know if this is the average ticket price,"
51:53;51:56;"but I definitely heard that like certain tickets"
51:56;51:58;"were $950 for each night."
51:58;51:59;"- That's crazy."
51:59;52:02;"I mean, most times when I see music,"
52:02;52:04;"especially in a big venue,"
52:04;52:05;"as soon as it starts, I'm like,"
52:05;52:07;"when is this gonna end?"
52:07;52:08;"- Yeah."
52:08;52:09;"- It's like an endurance test."
52:09;52:10;"I don't know."
52:10;52:15;"I just, if I'm like 180 yards away,"
52:15;52:18;"and I'm just kind of looking at like the big Jumbotron,"
52:18;52:19;"it sucks."
52:19;52:22;"- Yeah, that's why you just gotta have a beer,"
52:22;52:23;"bring a vape pen or something."
52:23;52:24;"I don't--"
52:24;52:26;"- And I'm not like, you know,"
52:26;52:29;"I don't worship Don Henley or Glen."
52:29;52:30;"I guess Gunfire's dead."
52:30;52:31;"- Glen will not be there."
52:31;52:32;"- Glen's son."
52:32;52:33;"It's just like, what is,"
52:33;52:35;"I don't, it just seems so depressing."
52:35;52:36;"- Yeah."
52:36;52:39;"- Like Glen being dead and the Eagles carrying on."
52:39;52:40;"- It's very Eagles."
52:40;52:41;"- It's very--"
52:41;52:42;"- It's very--"
52:42;52:43;"- On brand."
52:43;52:43;"- Yeah."
52:43;52:46;"The brand must persevere, man."
52:46;52:48;"- That's right."
52:48;52:49;"It's depressing."

54:59;55:02;"- I got a question for you,"
55:02;55:04;"'cause like I always felt, you know,"
55:04;55:06;"I told you as I'm making the record"
55:06;55:08;"increasingly I'm thinking about like shows."
55:08;55:09;"- Yeah."
55:09;55:11;"- Probably doing some shows next year."
55:11;55:13;"And back in the day I always felt like"
55:13;55:14;"I'd been to so many boring shows."
55:14;55:15;"- Yeah."
55:15;55:18;"- That I was like, I'd like to keep our sets concise."
55:18;55:18;"- Yeah."
55:18;55:20;"- But at the same time, now I'm being like,"
55:20;55:22;"well, pretty soon we're gonna have"
55:22;55:24;"four albums worth of material."
55:24;55:26;"- Can play longer shows."
55:26;55:26;"- Yeah."
55:26;55:28;"- And it's kinda like, okay,"
55:28;55:30;"I know there's people in the crowd who come to the show"
55:30;55:33;"and they appreciate that it's short and quick,"
55:33;55:35;"not too many slow songs in a row,"
55:35;55:37;"not too much noodling,"
55:37;55:39;"and you in and out, they like that."
55:39;55:41;"But do you think most people though,"
55:41;55:43;"if they're rolling to the show,"
55:43;55:45;"they bought a ticket,"
55:45;55:47;"they want it to be as long as possible?"
55:47;55:48;"What do you think?"
55:48;55:49;"- Okay, well--"
55:49;55:50;"- 'Cause certain bands, you know,"
55:50;55:52;"there's like Bruce Springsteen's of the world"
55:52;55:54;"who are like, they're fans,"
55:54;55:56;"if he doesn't play three hours, they're disappointed."
55:56;55:57;"- Right."
55:57;55:57;"- And I love Bruce,"
55:57;55:59;"but I've always been like a little nervous about like,"
55:59;56:01;"I've never been to a three and a half hour show."
56:01;56:02;"I don't know how my body would react."
56:02;56:05;"- Yeah, I'd want Bruce to play for three hours."
56:05;56:06;"You know what it is?"
56:06;56:09;"It's like Bruce somehow still seems inspired"
56:09;56:12;"and like pumped and like ready to bring it for three."
56:12;56:13;"- Yeah."
56:13;56:15;"- I don't get the sense that the Eagles"
56:15;56:17;"are in that same headspace."
56:17;56:19;"- Perhaps not."
56:19;56:20;"- You're still--"
56:20;56:23;"- Wouldn't that be like (beep) up if they're just like,"
56:23;56:25;"you know, man, we didn't think we'd be doing many shows,"
56:25;56:26;"but after Glenn died,"
56:26;56:29;"we just felt so fired up and energized."
56:29;56:31;"- Playing like four hour shows."
56:31;56:33;"- Yeah."
56:33;56:34;"- Oh man."
56:34;56:35;"- But it's his son filling in for him?"
56:35;56:36;"- Yeah."
56:36;56:37;"- Okay."
56:37;56:38;"- I guess they're keeping in the family."
56:38;56:39;"- Okay, but in your case, I would say--"
56:39;56:40;"- Do you wanna see a three hour,"
56:40;56:42;"15 minute Vampire Weekend show?"
56:42;56:47;"- No, but I wanna see two hours and 10 minutes."
56:47;56:47;"- Okay."
56:47;56:49;"- 'Cause I feel like I've seen you many times"
56:49;56:51;"and I also feel like it's good"
56:51;56:52;"to leave the audience wanting more."
56:52;56:53;"- Yeah."
56:53;56:54;"- When you're a younger band."
56:54;56:56;"But now you're really hitting your stride"
56:56;56:58;"as like a mature artist."
56:58;56:59;"- Grown man."
56:59;57:01;"- And I wanna see like a confident show"
57:01;57:04;"where you like kinda like kick it out"
57:04;57:06;"and let the edges be a little shaggy."
57:06;57:07;"- Okay."
57:07;57:09;"- Where it's not so orchestrated"
57:09;57:11;"and you just like let it be a little free"
57:11;57:15;"and like play some unpredictable tracks, jam it out."
57:15;57:19;"I'd like to see 210 pushing 220."
57:19;57:20;"- Okay."
57:20;57:21;"- That'd be epic."
57:21;57:23;"- Two hours and 10 minutes, not 210 minutes."
57:23;57:25;"- Yeah, yeah, two hours."
57:25;57:27;"Yeah, two hours, 10 minutes would be,"
57:27;57:28;"that would be awesome."
57:28;57:30;"- We've never played a show that long."
57:30;57:31;"I think the longest we ever played"
57:31;57:33;"is maybe like an hour 40."
57:33;57:35;"So that's not crazy,"
57:35;57:37;"throw another 30 on top of an hour 40."
57:37;57:39;"- Yeah, just pacing it right."
57:39;57:40;"- Yeah."
57:40;57:42;"I also feel like I gotta loosen up too"
57:42;57:45;"'cause like I think sometimes if the crowd's"
57:45;57:47;"not like going crazy throughout the show,"
57:47;57:48;"you get insecure."
57:48;57:50;"But then I think about when I go to see shows,"
57:50;57:51;"even when I see artists I love."
57:51;57:52;"- Yeah."
57:52;57:54;"- Even when I see artists who put on like a crazy show,"
57:54;57:55;"like one of the last arena shows I saw"
57:55;57:57;"before Roger Waters was Kanye."
57:57;57:58;"- Yeah."
57:58;57:59;"- Where he's like flying around."
57:59;58:00;"- I saw that show."
58:00;58:01;"- That show's wild, right?"
58:01;58:01;"- Yeah."
58:01;58:04;"- I love Kanye, I literally know every Kanye song."
58:04;58:06;"And even then, you know,"
58:06;58:07;"there's like about halfway through,"
58:07;58:10;"I was like now's a good time to use the restroom."
58:10;58:11;"- Right."
58:11;58:12;"- Check out the concessions."
58:12;58:14;"And it's not because I wanted to leave or anything,"
58:14;58:17;"it's just like, it's all good, you know?"
58:17;58:18;"And so when I was at Band Play,"
58:18;58:19;"and they start playing some slow songs"
58:19;58:20;"that you don't wanna hear them,"
58:20;58:22;"or sometimes they play something that you just don't wanna--"
58:22;58:24;"- Sometimes the slow songs are the ones"
58:24;58:26;"where you're just like getting in though."
58:26;58:27;"'Cause like listening to Dead Bootlegs,"
58:27;58:28;"which I know you've been doing."
58:28;58:30;"- Yep, that's true."
58:30;58:31;"- The Dead are incredible,"
58:31;58:34;"because they will like so confidently play"
58:34;58:36;"the slowest, quietest song."
58:36;58:38;"- A 19 minute morning do."
58:38;58:41;"- Yeah, or like a nine minute like Ro-Jimmy."
58:41;58:42;"- Right."
58:42;58:44;"- And there's like barely anything happening."
58:44;58:45;"- No, I agree with you."
58:45;58:47;"- And maybe half the arena's like getting nachos"
58:47;58:48;"and taking (beep)"
58:48;58:50;"but it's like all good."
58:50;58:52;"- I know what you mean."
58:52;58:53;"- It's so confident."
58:53;58:54;"- When you listen back to Grateful Dead show,"
58:54;58:56;"and you hear like the high energy ones,"
58:56;58:58;"like the 50s rock covers."
58:58;59:00;"- Yeah, or like Scarlet or something."
59:00;59:03;"- Well Scarlet, even Scarlet's mid-tempo, truthfully."
59:03;59:04;"But you know, just like--"
59:04;59:05;"- Promised Land?"
59:05;59:08;"- Not fake, yeah, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly covers."
59:08;59:10;"I'm sure like to some people that was like,"
59:10;59:11;"wow, they were really cooking."
59:11;59:12;"That's when they were rocking."
59:12;59:14;"But you listen back, it's like those songs are pretty lame"
59:14;59:15;"compared to the-- - Oh, totally."
59:15;59:17;"- The slow, beautiful, vibey ones."
59:17;59:18;"- Yeah."
59:18;59:19;"- But you know, sometimes on stage"
59:19;59:23;"when you play the slow, prettier ones,"
59:23;59:25;"you're not getting that immediate energy off the crowd."
59:25;59:28;"- But dude, that's where you dive into your confidence."
59:28;59:30;"- I remember-- - (beep) the crowd, man."
59:30;59:31;"You're there, you're like doing your thing."
59:31;59:33;"- I know, and maybe that's that grown-up stuff"
59:33;59:36;"that you're talking about is becoming more confident."
59:36;59:36;"I remember-- - I need to be"
59:36;59:38;"a tour consultant."
59:38;59:39;"- Oh yeah. - It sounds like, basically."
59:39;59:40;"- We're bringing you on the road, man."
59:40;59:42;"- Okay, I need to be--"
59:42;59:44;"- Spiritual advisor on the road."
59:44;59:45;"- I'll be writing the set lists."
59:45;59:46;"- That's right."
59:46;59:48;"- Choosing which ones we gotta jam out."
59:48;59:50;"- Yeah, for sure."
59:50;59:53;"- I wanna get you up to 210 by March 5th."
59:53;59:55;"- Let it breathe, just let it breathe."
59:55;59:59;"- Now we're gonna, at Cleveland, I need you at an hour 45,"
59:59;01:00:02;"but by Madison, Wisconsin, man, we need that 210 show."

01:01:51;01:01:53;"- Eight minute Cape Cod."
01:01:53;01:01:56;"- Vampire Cling full jam band."
01:01:56;01:01:59;"That'd be tight."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- Two hour, 10 show, eight minute Cape Cod."
01:02:01;01:02:02;"- Strong."
01:02:02;01:02:05;"- Yeah, this is gonna require a lot of discussion"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"and a lot of planning, but it's coming."
01:02:07;01:02:08;"- No set lists."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"I'm scared about the no set list thing."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"I really do want it to loosen up a bit."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"- That would be, yeah."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"No, you have to work up to that."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"- Yeah, there could be rough set list."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"For me, rather than having no set list,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"I would like maybe design a flow chart set list."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- Yeah."
01:02:22;01:02:25;"Would you ever make decisions on the fly playing a show?"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"Like, there's a set list,"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"and then depending on the vibe of the room,"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"you'd be like, actually, let's like jump to that song"
01:02:31;01:02:32;"and come back to the other one."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Or would all just be like, let's play the set list."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"- That's never really happened."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Occasionally, if I felt like my voice was giving out,"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"I might cut one or something, or who knows."
01:02:40;01:02:43;"But, you know, I think also getting older too,"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"it's like, you know, in your first few albums,"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"you're so nervous all the time."
01:02:47;01:02:48;"- Right."
01:02:48;01:02:50;"- And I'm not saying that I don't still have like anxiety"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"about a lot of stuff regarding music and career,"
01:02:53;01:02:56;"but in some ways, like the show,"
01:02:56;01:02:59;"it's like, we went out, you know, we toured three albums."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"- Yeah."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"- Here's one thing I'll say,"
01:03:01;01:03:04;"is that I do feel more confident about like taking some risks"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"and making the show longer and like taking some chances."
01:03:06;01:03:09;"'Cause if worst case scenario is like,"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"we just like suck one night,"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"I'm at a point in my life where I could be like,"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"eh, that's all right."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"If we take a few chances and it falls flat."
01:03:17;01:03:18;"- That's the thing."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"If it sucks 'cause you're taking chances, that's cool."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"- It's better than sucking just 'cause you're like a robot."
01:03:24;01:03:25;"- Exactly."
01:03:25;01:03:26;"I think if the fans are gonna,"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"I think that's why people love ""The Dead"" partially,"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"'cause like ""The Dead"" played so many bad shows."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- Right, infamously."
01:03:32;01:03:36;"- And they did so many terrible covers."
01:03:36;01:03:39;"But it was because they were like trying stuff out"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"and the fans felt like they were like"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"on a journey with the band."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"So if they like fell flat"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"because they were trying something new,"
01:03:45;01:03:48;"then it was like, well, we're along for the ride."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"But if you're like falling flat"
01:03:49;01:03:51;"'cause you're a robot, like you said,"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"then it's like a bummer."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"It's like, what are you even doing?"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"So if you're trying stuff and you fall flat,"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"like the Madison show,"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"you play for two hours, 40 minutes."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"And then it was just like-"
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- You were just bored."
01:04:02;01:04:05;"- And like, yeah, whatever."
01:04:05;01:04:08;"- Honestly, if we ever do play Madison Square Garden."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"- Oh, I was thinking Madison, Wisconsin."
01:04:10;01:04:13;"- Honestly-"
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- MSG, you dial it in."
01:04:14;01:04:16;"- It's way funnier that we just fall flat,"
01:04:16;01:04:19;"a hometown show, iconic Madison Square Garden,"
01:04:19;01:04:23;"and just be like, yeah, they really sucked, man."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"Okay, no, Madison, Wisconsin,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"kind of a kinder vibe town."
01:04:27;01:04:30;"- You open with an eight minute Cape Cod at MSG."
01:04:30;01:04:34;"- I wanna do it so badly now."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"♪ Is your bed made ♪"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"♪ Is your sweater on ♪"

01:05:06;01:05:11;"- Yeah, we'll see, when we're actually back on,"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"I haven't played shows in years,"
01:05:12;01:05:15;"outside of the little Bernie Sanders gigs,"
01:05:15;01:05:16;"I haven't played shows in years."
01:05:16;01:05:17;"- And my 40th birthday."
01:05:17;01:05:19;"- Oh, and I jumped on stage at your 40th birthday,"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"that was about it."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"- That's crazy, dude, years."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"- Or yeah, yeah, three years."
01:05:24;01:05:27;"Three years since the last proper Vampire Tour."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- That's gonna be crazy when you play that first gig."
01:05:29;01:05:32;"- It's gonna be, yeah, we'll probably have to do a small one."
01:05:32;01:05:33;"- Troubadour, dude."
01:05:33;01:05:33;"- Troubadour."
01:05:33;01:05:36;"- That's the show to see."
01:05:36;01:05:39;"- I also just feel like, you know,"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"it can be really confusing about your relationship"
01:05:41;01:05:44;"with your fans, 'cause like, you go on social media,"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"you get like the most, like, people say crazy stuff to you,"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"or like you got haters, and I have to believe though,"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"like I'm a fan of a lot of stuff,"
01:05:52;01:05:53;"and if I wanna go see an artist,"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"and I caught them on like an awkward night,"
01:05:55;01:05:59;"where they (beep) up, they had a laugh about something,"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"they did something kinda weird that fell a little flat,"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"I would rather see that show."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"- Oh yeah."
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- 'Cause also, I'll tell you, I'm not gonna name names,"
01:06:06;01:06:07;"'cause I don't wanna throw anybody under the bus,"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"and I think we need all types of stuff"
01:06:09;01:06:12;"in the music industry, but I was like watching"
01:06:12;01:06:17;"some artists recently who were doing a huge spectacle show,"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"not talking about Roger Waters, by the way,"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"and the first five minutes, I was like blown away,"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"and I was just like, this is incredible,"
01:06:26;01:06:29;"the showmanship, the stage show, the video,"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"like I was like, wow, these people shot a feature film,"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"they did everything, and it really blew me away,"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"and then the artistry was very high,"
01:06:37;01:06:38;"and these are artists that I respect,"
01:06:38;01:06:41;"but I felt for me as a fan, after 10 or 15 minutes,"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"it's like you get used to anything,"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"you go live in a mansion, after a while--"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"- You get used to the view."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"- You get used to the view, and somebody comes over,"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"like this view's incredible, and you're just like,"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"yeah, whatever, you wanna see my PlayStation?"
01:06:53;01:06:54;"Like that's what happens, so anyway,"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"after 10 or 15 minutes, I was like, honestly--"
01:06:57;01:06:58;"- Looking at Twitter."
01:06:58;01:07:01;"- Yeah, there might as well, this stuff on stage,"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"it's like, but anyway, that's me,"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"but I have to believe that some of our fans"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"are probably not that different,"
01:07:07;01:07:10;"they wanna see that eight minute Cape of God,"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"with, might have a few bum notes."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"- That's the most exciting part."
01:07:14;01:07:15;"- Yeah, it's like, whoa."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"- I guess you'll see who your real fans are."
01:07:18;01:07:21;"If you take it out, and like let it be"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"a little rough around the edges,"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"and people are just confused, and they're like,"
01:07:24;01:07:29;"these guys suck, and they walk, well then they walk."
01:07:29;01:07:30;"- All right, we're just."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"Back to, we're on the path to you playing."
01:07:35;01:07:36;"- Back to the Mercury Lounge."
01:07:36;01:07:39;"- 200 people, in about four years."
01:07:39;01:07:43;"- Okay, so eight minute Cape--"
01:07:43;01:07:43;"- But it's all heads."
01:07:43;01:07:45;"- It's all heads, eight minute Cape Cod."
01:07:45;01:07:47;"- It's all heads."
01:07:47;01:07:49;"That's the thing, dude, it's like a--"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- 37 people in Madison, Wisconsin."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- This is like classic--"
01:07:52;01:07:53;"- Hemorrhaging money."
01:07:53;01:07:57;"- Got this new van, it's just a money pit."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"(laughing)"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"- Oh man, it's back to the old days."
01:08:03;01:08:08;"Waking up at 7 a.m., CT driving from Boise to Salt Lake."
01:08:08;01:08:11;"- That's a funny one, though."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"It's like, play to like, I don't know,"
01:08:14;01:08:18;"7,000 people that are like, yeah, I've heard of this band."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Oh, you got tickets, cool."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"As opposed to like 300 people that are just like,"
01:08:23;01:08:27;"know every word, and are just like fired up."
01:08:27;01:08:29;"That's a space where I could really excel, though."
01:08:29;01:08:30;"- Oh my God, yeah."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"- Being the band that like, (beep) up a lot."
01:08:32;01:08:33;"(laughing)"
01:08:33;01:08:35;"- I love this direction."
01:08:35;01:08:37;"I'm like, kind of surprised to hear"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"that you're so open to these dynamics."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"- Well, you know what, I've never felt"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"super confident in the show."
01:08:43;01:08:47;"Partially because, you know, we've had great shows,"
01:08:47;01:08:51;"but partially because we work so hard on the albums."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"So much attention to detail on the albums."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"Raking myself and everybody else over the coals,"
01:08:55;01:08:57;"like hard, hardcore."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"And then by the time you get on the road,"
01:08:59;01:09:00;"it's like you're exhausted, and all you wanna do"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"is just make sure it works."
01:09:02;01:09:03;"- Yeah."
01:09:03;01:09:06;"- You know, it's like, it is hard to feel relaxed"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"about the shows, but I'm okay with letting the albums"
01:09:07;01:09:09;"be the albums and the shows be the shows."
01:09:09;01:09:10;"- Oh, for sure."
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Yeah, I mean, like, the live versions"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"are gonna have their own life."
01:09:13;01:09:16;"- Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:09:16;01:09:17;"I hope I didn't pick the wrong song,"
01:09:17;01:09:20;"'cause like, I think now a few heads"
01:09:20;01:09:21;"will be expecting an Eight Minute Cape Cod."
01:09:21;01:09:23;"It might be a different song."
01:09:23;01:09:24;"Well, we'll try it."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"That's the thing, we gotta try it."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"- I think Kids Don't Stand a Chance,"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"you could really take that out."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"- Interesting."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Yeah, there's a while we didn't play it that much."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"I used to find it hard to sing live."
01:09:33;01:09:34;"We'll get into it."

01:13:23;01:13:25;"Why 1983?"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"- Reading Rainbow."

01:13:28;01:13:31;"I was not alive in '83."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"- I was six."
01:13:32;01:13:33;"- You were six?"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"I was one year out from being born."
01:13:35;01:13:36;"- Conceived?"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"- Yeah, I was born in April, so I was conceived in '83."
01:13:38;01:13:43;"- Conceived in July of '83."
01:13:43;01:13:44;"- Summer of '83?"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Yeah, I guess this probably was right around--"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"- Summer of '83."
01:13:48;01:13:49;"- This is right around the time I would've"

01:13:50;01:13:54;"So the number five song, This Week in 1983,"

01:14:52;01:14:52;"- Yeah."
01:14:52;01:14:54;"- Yeah, 'cause it's like, you've heard Beat It"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"and Thriller so many times."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Yeah."
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Like, you're not gonna pick those as your top three."

01:15:27;01:15:29;"Like her brother's wife?"
01:15:29;01:15:31;"- Maybe another one of the Jacksons' wife"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"had a problem with LaToya."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"- That would be stressful."
01:15:35;01:15:38;"- Your sibling's spouse you have beef with?"
01:15:38;01:15:39;"That would suck."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"- I was thinking about that too recently."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"I was picturing, somebody was telling me a story"
01:15:43;01:15:46;"about being with a family,"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"and with adult children,"
01:15:49;01:15:53;"a big family with all the wives and husbands,"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"and girlfriends."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"And I was also just picturing about being a parent."
01:15:56;01:15:57;"Maybe 'cause I'm older now,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"and just picturing being a parent."
01:15:59;01:16:02;"And it's like, I guess this is what so many dumb movies"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"are about."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"You have a kid, and you just don't (beep)"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"with their significant other."
01:16:08;01:16:09;"- Wait, what do you mean you don't (beep)"
01:16:09;01:16:11;"with their significant other?"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"You have sex with them?"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"- No, you don't like them."
01:16:13;01:16:15;"- You mean like your brother?"
01:16:15;01:16:16;"- No, your child."
01:16:16;01:16:19;"- Now I'm straight up confused."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"- Okay, no, I'm saying your son,"
01:16:21;01:16:22;"so Jake. - Oh, okay."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"- Your son Jake Jr. comes home."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"- Yep, yep."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"- And-- - In like 25 years."
01:16:27;01:16:29;"- In 25 years, your son Jake Jr. comes home"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"from graduate school, and he's like--"
01:16:32;01:16:33;"- I'm engaged."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"- Yeah, dad, I'm engaged."
01:16:35;01:16:36;"You're like, oh, I'm so excited,"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"I can't wait to meet her."
01:16:38;01:16:39;"Or him."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"Let's assume that Jake Jr. is gay."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"(laughing)"
01:16:43;01:16:44;"I just go, you know, like--"
01:16:44;01:16:45;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I dig it, I dig it."
01:16:45;01:16:47;"- We're always so heteronormative."
01:16:47;01:16:49;"So Jake Jr. comes home, and he's like,"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"""Dad, I met a guy, and we're engaged."""
01:16:51;01:16:52;"And you're like, ""I'm so proud of you,"
01:16:52;01:16:53;"""I'm so glad you're happy."""
01:16:53;01:16:57;"And then you meet Jake Jr.'s future husband,"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"and he's like, ""Good to meet you, sir."""
01:16:58;01:16:59;"And you're like, ""Oh, great to meet you."""
01:16:59;01:17:01;"And you guys are just like talking or something."
01:17:01;01:17:03;"You're like, ""Hey, I'm gonna throw on some music."""
01:17:03;01:17:05;"Hotel California, cool."
01:17:05;01:17:07;"And then the boyfriend, the fiance--"
01:17:07;01:17:08;"- My future son-in-law."
01:17:08;01:17:11;"- Your future son-in-law is like,"
01:17:11;01:17:14;"""You know what, actually, man, if you don't mind,"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"""I hate '70s music."""
01:17:16;01:17:17;"- I hate the palette."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"- I hate the palette."
01:17:18;01:17:19;"You know what I love is from around--"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"I have great memories of kind of like around the time"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"when I was a kid was like the chain smokers"
01:17:24;01:17:28;"and that kind of, you know, Trump-era EDM."
01:17:28;01:17:29;"Do you have any of that?"
01:17:29;01:17:32;"And you're just like, ""Uh."""
01:17:32;01:17:33;"And you don't wanna embarrass Jake Jr.,"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"so you're like, ""Uh, okay."""
01:17:35;01:17:37;"- Well, let me just get on Apple Music here."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"- Let me get on Apple--"
01:17:39;01:17:44;"Let me use my mind chip to throw on my Trump-era EDM playlist."
01:17:44;01:17:47;"- You know, I used to do a radio show back in the day"
01:17:47;01:17:48;"on Apple Music."
01:17:48;01:17:49;"It might be archived."
01:17:49;01:17:53;"- And then also like-- - 25."
01:17:53;01:17:56;"- Your future son-in-law is also kind of like--"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"He's also like bringing Jake Jr. further from the path."
01:17:59;01:18:02;"- Trump was our greatest president."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"- And also like maybe Jake Jr.'s like previous boyfriend"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"was like in an Eagles cover band."
01:18:06;01:18:08;"- Ooh. - And you're just like--"
01:18:08;01:18:09;"- And I really bonded."
01:18:09;01:18:12;"- No, you like-- you were so close with him,"
01:18:12;01:18:15;"with Tony, who was in an Eagles cover band."
01:18:15;01:18:17;"- They were together for like four years."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"It's gotta be painful to be a parent"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"and like really like your kids significant other than--"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"- Oh, yeah, that's classic. - And then they break up"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"after like four years. - Oh, yeah, that happens a lot."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"- (sighs)"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"- Especially if your son's boyfriend"
01:18:29;01:18:30;"is in an Eagles cover band."
01:18:30;01:18:34;"- And then his true love is just into that Trump era EDM."
01:18:34;01:18:35;"(laughing)"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"- Just family barbecues."
01:18:37;01:18:39;"(soft music)"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"- Yeah, I did a radio show about 25 years ago"
01:18:41;01:18:42;"with a friend of mine."
01:18:42;01:18:44;"He had a band called Vampire Weekend."
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Never heard of him."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"- Let me play you some."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Ooh, this sucks."
01:18:52;01:18:55;"- Yeah, they get a little more experimental."
01:18:55;01:18:56;"Later on in their career."
01:18:56;01:18:57;"- You know, man, I'd love to play you--"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"- Ended up kinda."
01:18:58;01:19:02;"- I'd love to play you the 2023 version,"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"Neurolux in Boise, Idaho,"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"version of Cape Cod, ""Classic Awesome Man."""
01:19:07;01:19:10;"They stretched that one out to 15 minutes"
01:19:10;01:19:14;"and it is like, ""Jake Jr., your dad sucks."""
01:19:14;01:19:15;"(laughing)"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"Like you can't do holidays together anymore."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"- Just barely concealed rage."
01:19:20;01:19:21;"- And like you're still in touch"
01:19:21;01:19:22;"with like the previous boyfriend."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"- Oh my God."
01:19:24;01:19:28;"Tony, if you ever wanna get a drink and talk Eagles,"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"you know--"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"- Or talk late period Vampire Weekend."
01:19:30;01:19:36;"- If you ever wanna listen to some VW bootlegs,"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"you know, just 'cause you and Jake Jr. broke up"
01:19:38;01:19:39;"doesn't mean we can't still be buddies."
01:19:39;01:19:44;"- Dude, First Avenue, Minneapolis, June of 2022."
01:19:44;01:19:48;"- The legendary 23 minute, ""Kids Don't Stand a Chance."""
01:19:48;01:19:50;"I was there, man."
01:19:50;01:19:53;"- That's for the spoken word segment in the middle."
01:19:53;01:19:56;"- Actually brings a tear to the eye still."
01:19:56;01:19:59;"- This like made up story is actually two point yet."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"I hope if you have a son and your son has a boyfriend"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"that you guys can at least,"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"even if he's not into the tasteful palette of '70s music,"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"that he can at least respect that you are."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"- Can you imagine the tasteful palette of '70s rock"
01:20:10;01:20:13;"in like another 25 years?"
01:20:13;01:20:15;"What year is it right now, 20?"
01:20:15;01:20:19;"Just like in like 2041 or whatever it is."
01:20:19;01:20:20;"- I guess that would kind of be like somebody"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"playing you big band music and being like,"
01:20:22;01:20:25;"""Now this."" - Well, that's what it is like now."
01:20:25;01:20:31;"I mean, '70s music is like 40 something years old."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"And like in the '70s, it would have been like"
01:20:33;01:20:35;"listening to music from like the '30s."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"That's what it already is like."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"Can you imagine like,"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"- You're listening to Jake's golden oldies on."
01:20:40;01:20:41;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"Are there gonna be classic rock stations"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"like in 25 years playing like Steve Miller?"
01:20:45;01:20:46;"- I don't think there's gonna be like"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"traditional radio anymore by that point."
01:20:48;01:20:51;"So like definitely, probably by that point,"
01:20:51;01:20:53;"like Sirius and Apple and stuff."

01:42:13;01:42:17;"And I think now they're dealing with gentrification and become kind of hipstered out."
01:42:17;01:42:20;"But for a long time it was known as one of the major Caribbean neighborhoods."
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Yeah, yeah."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"In 1981 there was a riot, the Brixton Riot."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"You know, people dealing with police brutality and stuff."
01:42:26;01:42:31;"So, actually, there's kind of like-- it says that Eddie Grand wrote this song in response to the riots"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"where there were a lot of Caribbean immigrants, high unemployment, getting ignored."
01:42:35;01:42:41;"So, actually, this kind of like feel-good song kind of has like almost a political backstory, you know?"
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Yeah, I'm into this song."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"I just want to make sure we're getting the lyrics."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"This is the verse."
01:43:08;01:43:12;"""Down the street there's violence and lots of work to be done."
01:43:12;01:43:16;"No place to hang out or washing, and I can't blame all on the sun."""
01:43:16;01:43:17;"Interesting."
01:43:17;01:43:21;"And then the verse is, ""We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue and then we'll take it higher."""
01:43:21;01:43:25;"So maybe it's almost like, ""F*ck it. It's riot time."""
01:43:25;01:43:29;"Second verse, ""Working so hard like a soldier, can't afford a thing on TV."""
01:43:29;01:43:31;"I love-- that's a very Bruce line."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"It's like, watching TV, it's like, ""I can't afford it."""

01:44:11;01:44:13;"You're just subjugated."
01:44:13;01:44:16;"That's brutal. That's like a real brutal take on capitalism."
01:44:16;01:44:19;"Get home, sit down to finally relax."
01:44:19;01:44:20;"Crack one."

01:44:30;01:44:33;"Okay. ""Electric Avenue,"" great song."

01:52:19;01:52:21;"being--just, like, roasting him."
01:52:21;01:52:22;"Just, like, telling a story about, like--"
01:52:22;01:52:23;"Oh, in Spanish?"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"Like, we were in a club"
01:52:25;01:52:28;"and this Caucasian Canadian walked in"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"and this kid was, like, such a prick."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"Such a tool."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"Everybody in the club hated him."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"We only let him in 'cause he was rich."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"We, like, charged extra on this kid, like--"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"He had no idea, and then he just comes back in."
01:52:39;01:52:41;"♪ Te, te ♪"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"♪ Quiero ver bailar tu pelo ♪"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"♪ Quiero ser tu ritua ♪"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"♪ Que le enseñes a mi boca ♪"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"Song of the Summer, man."
01:52:49;01:52:52;"I can't believe it. It doesn't feel like summer to me."
01:52:52;01:52:54;"It's been hotter than--"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"I know, it's very hot."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"But I've just been in L.A. too much"
01:52:57;01:52:59;"and it's, like--it's just always hot."
01:52:59;01:53:01;"I've just been working."
01:53:01;01:53:03;"Also because I'm a grown man."
01:53:03;01:53:04;"I'm not in school anymore."
01:53:04;01:53:05;"Yeah."
01:53:05;01:53:06;"Summer. What is summer?"
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Eh."
01:53:07;01:53:09;"It's feeling like summer to me."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"What makes it, like, summery to you?"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"Are you, like, barbecuing more?"
01:53:12;01:53:13;"Yep."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Are you cracking up more cold ones?"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"No, I'm pretty consistent with that."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"[laughs]"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"It's getting dark real late."
01:53:21;01:53:23;"Yeah, I guess that's kind of different."
01:53:23;01:53:26;"Doing some summer traveling."
01:53:26;01:53:28;"And, yeah, I mean, I don't have air conditioning"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"in my--"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"Oh, really?"
01:53:30;01:53:31;"--in my workspace, in my studio."
01:53:31;01:53:32;"Oh, right, I forgot about that."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"We discussed that last show."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"So you're just dripping in sweat--"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"Yep."
01:53:37;01:53:38;"--painting--"
01:53:38;01:53:39;"Yep."
01:53:39;01:53:40;"--listening to podcasts--"
01:53:40;01:53:41;"Yep."
01:53:41;01:53:42;"--and internet radio shows."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Yep."
01:53:43;01:53:45;"Okay, yeah, I believe that."
01:53:45;01:53:46;"Apple radio."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"If you're painting all day shirtless"
01:53:48;01:53:51;"in a 97-degree studio--"
01:53:51;01:53:52;"Yeah."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"--that's gonna feel like summer."
01:53:53;01:53:54;"That's summer."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"Yeah, okay."
01:53:55;01:53:59;"Well, another great show in the can."
01:53:59;01:54:00;"Thank you to our special guests,"
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Jimmy Harnett and Jerry Cronin,"
01:54:02;01:54:05;"the ad man and the composer"
01:54:05;01:54:08;"behind the $5-foot-long jingle."
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Thanks to Seinfeld 2000"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"for getting on the mic more."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Did you have a good time?"
01:54:13;01:54:14;"The best."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"We really appreciate that."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"I want to keep encouraging that."
01:54:17;01:54:19;"Oh, yeah."
01:54:19;01:54:22;"You did a great job today, and, again,"
01:54:22;01:54:23;"if anybody has any information"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"about this whole Curb Your Enthusiasm subway thing,"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"let us know, 'cause Seinfeld's very upset about this."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Seinfeld--"
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Even if you don't have any info,"
01:54:30;01:54:31;"just let us know how you feel."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Sound off in the comments."
01:54:32;01:54:35;"Is there a release date for the new episode of--"
01:54:35;01:54:37;"or season of Curb?"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"October 1st."
01:54:38;01:54:39;"Woo!"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"Promo's out."
01:54:40;01:54:42;"Oh, Lin-Manuel Miranda's in it."
01:54:42;01:54:43;"Okay."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"Yeah."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"Great."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"Interesting."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"You think Larry liked Hamilton?"
01:54:47;01:54:48;"No."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"Hard to say."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"Seinfeld, do you like Hamilton?"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"Yeah, sure, it's catchy."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Okay."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"That's cool."
01:54:54;01:54:56;"I'm not, like, passionate about it."
01:54:56;01:54:57;"About what?"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"Hamilton."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Do you like Hamilton?"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"[laughter]"
01:55:01;01:55:02;"You know..."
01:55:02;01:55:03;"See?"
01:55:03;01:55:04;"I'm not a huge fan."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"I totally respect it, but I was like--"
01:55:06;01:55:07;"it's just one of those things where, like,"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"I saw it pretty early on Broadway,"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"and I was like, ""That was okay."""
01:55:11;01:55:12;"Yeah."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Not for me."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"And then I just found that nobody agreed with me afterwards,"
01:55:15;01:55:17;"so at this point, you know, I want to be well-liked,"
01:55:17;01:55:19;"so at this point-- that's amazing."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"Yeah."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"It does seem, like, socially unacceptable"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"to say anything less than, like, ""It's genius."""
01:55:24;01:55:25;"I haven't seen it."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"I have no idea what it is."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"I mean, I know what it is."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"It's amazing, and honestly, Jake, if you see it"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"and you tell me it's anything less than genius--"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"Then you're going to question our friendship."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"It's great."
01:55:33;01:55:35;"Oh, by the way, Seinfeld,"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"me and Jake were hanging out out of town"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"before the 4th of July,"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"and we were hanging out with a dude who, in the '90s,"
01:55:40;01:55:43;"was a staff writer on Friends."
01:55:43;01:55:44;"Oh."
01:55:44;01:55:45;"Should we get him on the show?"
01:55:45;01:55:46;"Why?"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"I mean, come on."
01:55:48;01:55:49;"We can talk about--"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Let's talk turkey."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Yeah."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"Turkey about ruining television."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"Okay."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"I need to get Seinfeld 2000 and the Friends writer"
01:55:56;01:55:58;"talking to each other."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"Dialoguing."
01:55:59;01:56:01;"We're about bringing people together on this show."
01:56:01;01:56:03;"Okay, thanks, everybody, for listening."
01:56:03;01:56:04;"We'll be back in two weeks."
01:56:04;01:56:08;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kaden."
01:56:08;01:56:11;"Be-be-be-be-be-be-beasts."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"One."
