00:13;00:16;"This is a very historical episode"
00:16;00:18;"of Time"

00:28;00:30;"With Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:39;"They passed me by"
00:39;00:42;"All of those great romances"
00:42;00:46;"They were a felt, probably"
00:46;00:49;"All my rightful chances"
00:49;00:52;"My picture clear"
00:52;00:57;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:00;"And so I dealt you the blow"
01:00;01:03;"One of us had to go"
01:03;01:08;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:08;01:11;"One of us is crying"
01:11;01:14;"One of us is lying"
01:14;01:18;"Leave it on me, babe"
01:18;01:22;"Alright, Time Crisis back once again. What's up, Jake?"
01:22;01:24;"Not a whole lot. I'm just, uh,"
01:25;01:28;"opening up a Wikipedia page for Jolly Ranchers."
01:28;01:32;"Unrelated to Time Crisis."
01:32;01:35;"You were just at home opening up the Wikipedia page, like,"
01:35;01:37;"""Oh, sh*t, we're recording TC right now."""
01:37;01:40;"Yeah, I needed to get the backstory in Jolly Ranchers,"
01:40;01:42;"and I should say I was just on the"
01:42;01:44;"page for Eddie Van Halen."
01:44;01:46;"Rest in peace, Eddie Van Halen."
01:46;01:50;"I feel like we've never talked too much about Van Halen on this show."
01:50;01:52;"I feel like we've joked about, like,"
01:52;01:55;"party bands in, like, SoCal."
01:55;01:58;"And, like, ""These guys are the best band coming out of Pasadena."""
01:58;02:02;"Guys, we talked about Van Halen in episode 89."
02:02;02:04;"It was in the Top 5."
02:04;02:08;"1984, ""Jump"" was the number one song."
02:08;02:10;"So I think that was the only time."
02:10;02:12;"Wait, how did you access? Look at that number crunch."
02:12;02:14;"Yeah, how did you crunch that number?"
02:14;02:18;"You know what, I googled ""Van Halen Jump Time Crisis"""
02:18;02:20;"because I remembered ""Jump"" somehow being on the show."
02:20;02:23;"And thanks to our friends at the TCU Wiki,"
02:23;02:25;"it's all laid out for us."
02:25;02:26;"Wow."
02:26;02:30;"I know we've discussed it, at least in private conversation, Jake,"
02:30;02:33;"because we've talked about your uncle here and there,"
02:33;02:35;"who's a rock musician."
02:35;02:38;"And he grew up in Pasadena, right?"
02:38;02:41;"And he knew David Lee Roth and the Van Halens"
02:41;02:44;"as just, like, some local kids playing in a garage band or something?"
02:44;02:49;"Yeah, the way he tells it, yeah, my Uncle Ted is a Pasadena-based rock musician."
02:49;02:54;"He actually used to play gigs back in the '80s and '90s at the Old Town Pub,"
02:54;02:59;"which, of course, is sort of one of the home venues for Richard Pictures these days."
02:59;03:01;"Or, you know, pre-COVID."
03:01;03:04;"And referenced in a Mountain Bruce song."
03:04;03:08;"""Dead night in Medina at the Old Town Pub."""
03:08;03:11;"Hell yeah. So, Ted, he's told me that, like,"
03:11;03:15;"and who knows how this, you know, like, what's real."
03:15;03:18;"But yeah, he's like, ""Yeah, I saw them play big house parties."""
03:18;03:22;"Like, you know, like, you can picture, like, the Richard Linklater movie."
03:22;03:26;"With, like, the, like, nice tracking shot into, like, the sprawling house."
03:26;03:28;"The parents are away."
03:28;03:30;"And, like, there's dudes set up by the pool."
03:30;03:33;"This, like, opulent, like, Pasadena house."
03:33;03:36;"He said he saw them there. And, like, they would play."
03:36;03:40;"I remember years ago, he was telling me, like, ""Oh, yeah, I knew where they lived."""
03:40;03:42;"And, like, sometimes I'd walk by and, like, watch their practice."
03:42;03:44;"Or, like, hear it, you know?"
03:44;03:49;"I seem to recall reading somewhere that the reason David Lee Roth got to be the singer"
03:49;03:51;"was 'cause he owned a PA."
03:51;03:54;"I love that. I mean, that's pretty high-"
03:54;03:56;"The truth is, he's a wild man."
03:56;03:58;"Obviously, we don't want to make it all about him."
03:58;04:00;"You know, we lost Eddie Van Halen."
04:00;04:05;"But it is funny that, like, I mean, David Lee Roth, it's even by the,"
04:05;04:08;"if you look at all, like, the '80s hair metal bands,"
04:08;04:10;"obviously, they started in the '70s."
04:10;04:13;"I mean, he's like a true American original."
04:13;04:16;"They would sing in this kind of crazy way that suits their music."
04:16;04:19;"And he's just, like, this hilarious personality, wild man."
04:19;04:25;"And then, of course, Eddie Van Halen is, like, truly, just on a technical level,"
04:25;04:28;"nobody sounds like him as a guitarist."
04:28;04:31;"So it is just kind of funny that two dudes in the same town,"
04:31;04:35;"I'm not gonna say David Lee Roth is as good a singer as Eddie Van Halen is at guitar."
04:35;04:37;"That'd be a bit much."
04:37;04:40;"But I'm just saying it's, like, you know, sometimes you get bands"
04:40;04:44;"where there's, like, an Eddie Van Halen and then, like, a few schlubs."
04:44;04:48;"And then eventually, maybe Eddie Van Halen, he moves to Hollywood and he links up."
04:48;04:51;"He finds, like, the crazy singer."
04:51;04:55;"But it's just funny that these dudes just kind of were in, like,"
04:55;04:57;"probably went to the same high school or something."
04:57;04:59;"It works. I mean, I was listening to some today,"
04:59;05:03;"and I was thinking about that exactly, like, Van Halen,"
05:03;05:08;"like a very formally innovative guitar player and a virtuoso, obviously."
05:08;05:13;"But also, Van Halen was a complete, fun, like, party rock band."
05:13;05:14;"Yeah."
05:14;05:16;"And it's interesting how he didn't, yeah, David Lee Roth,"
05:16;05:19;"he didn't find a singer that was, like, could sing, like,"
05:19;05:23;"like some '70s prog band, like, something like the dude from Sticks"
05:23;05:26;"or, like, even, like, a friend from Mercury or something,"
05:26;05:28;"like the singer in, like, Kansas."
05:28;05:32;"Like, he found this, like, dude that was, like, barely made it."
05:32;05:35;"Like, it works so well. It's so perfect for the sound."
05:35;05:38;"But, like, it's shocking that it does work."
05:38;05:42;"Right. And obviously, it didn't work on a personal level, infamously."
05:42;05:43;"Right."
05:43;05:46;"They became one of the best-selling American rock bands of all time"
05:46;05:50;"because they had such extreme flavors in the band."
05:50;05:54;"But it also meant that that formation could not last forever."
05:54;05:57;"And honestly, I can think of two bands that changed singers"
05:57;06:01;"and still did their thing, and it's Van Halen and Black Sabbath."
06:01;06:03;"Yeah, that's a good point."
06:03;06:06;"Van Halen legitimately spanned decades."
06:06;06:10;"Like, right now, in the Sammy Hagar era, early '90s,"
06:10;06:14;"they made, like, a legitimate early '90s rock hit with a different singer,"
06:14;06:18;"like, well over a decade past their, like, full explosion"
06:18;06:20;"as this, like, pop metal thing."
06:20;06:22;"That's a real career. It's amazing."
06:22;06:25;"Were you ever, like, a deep Van Halen fan, Jake?"
06:25;06:27;"No. Not really my thing."
06:27;06:29;"I mean, I enjoyed-- I liked some of the hits."
06:29;06:31;"Like, I threw on the first record today"
06:31;06:33;"when I was driving around running errands."
06:33;06:36;"And, like, yeah, ""Running With the Devil,"" come on."
06:36;06:37;"I know this is lame."
06:37;06:39;"If you're, like, a Van Halen head and you're listening,"
06:39;06:43;"it's like you're a deadhead saying ""Touch of Grey"" is your favorite dead song."
06:43;06:45;"""Jump"" is my favorite Van Halen song."
06:45;06:48;"I understand that that's lame, but that's just where I'm at with it."
06:48;06:53;"No, ""Jump's"" a great song, and that song is very not guitar-centric."
06:53;06:55;"Is there any guitar on it?"
06:55;06:57;"I think there's, like, an insane guitar solo on it."
06:57;07:00;"I can picture in the video, like, Eddie plays the synth at some point, right?"
07:00;07:02;"Yeah, I think so."
07:02;07:05;"Anyway, that's all to say that that was a band that--"
07:05;07:07;"they could do a lot of different things."
07:07;07:09;"It wasn't just, like, every song was, like, ""Eruption,"""
07:09;07:11;"you know, like, crazy shredder guitar."
07:11;07:14;"They could also, like, do, like, a solid synth rock song."
07:14;07:15;"And they spanned the decades."

08:31;08:33;"He said that he never learned how to read music."
08:33;08:37;"But he started out playing piano."
08:37;08:40;"And he would, like, go to classical music competitions or something"
08:40;08:43;"and kind of, like, just play by ear what he heard."
08:43;08:45;"He's just on some other level."
08:45;08:49;"I was reading that he won, like, multiple classical piano competitions"
08:49;08:52;"in Long Beach in, like, the 1960s."
08:52;08:55;"But it didn't even occur to me that, yeah, he wasn't reading music."
08:55;08:56;"That's wild."
08:56;08:58;"Yeah, I guess he just had a hell of an ear."
08:58;09:00;"Also, born in Amsterdam."
09:00;09:02;"Didn't know that."
09:02;09:04;"I mean, I knew that they were Dutch."
09:04;09:07;"I was just like, ""Your last name's Van Halen?"""
09:07;09:11;"I mean, hindsight's 20/20, but it's, like, just the perfect name for a band."
09:11;09:12;"Oh, yeah."
09:12;09:13;"Van Halen."
09:13;09:18;"I wonder if David Lee Roth ever had a feeling about the Van Halen brothers,"
09:18;09:22;"similar to Ray A. Kroc and the McDonald's brothers,"
09:22;09:27;"as we've discussed many times in the McDonald's origin story film ""The Founder."""
09:27;09:30;"There's a climactic scene where Ray Kroc,"
09:30;09:33;"he kind of has to own all the sh-- things he's done to the McDonald's brothers."
09:33;09:36;"And part of his, like, reasoning for why he had to, like,"
09:36;09:39;"fight tooth and nail to build McDonald's empire the way he wanted to"
09:39;09:43;"was, like, ""You guys don't know how good you had your last name."
09:43;09:44;"McDonald's, perfect for a restaurant."
09:44;09:46;"What about me, Ray Kroc?"
09:46;09:49;"What does that make you think of? Kroc is sh--."""
09:49;09:53;"And they're trying to make, like, some kind of statement about America"
09:53;09:57;"and privilege or perceived lack of privilege."
09:57;10:00;"But anyway, I could picture, like, David Lee Roth is such a--"
10:00;10:02;"I guess he punched up his name enough."
10:02;10:07;"If it was just David Roth, that's a tough name for, like,"
10:07;10:09;"an '80s rock god."
10:09;10:13;"David Lee Roth is pretty good, but I can just imagine him being like,"
10:13;10:15;"""My last name's Roth."
10:15;10:18;"What does that make you think of, like, Philip Roth?"
10:18;10:20;"Solid writer, not a rock star."""
10:20;10:23;"""And you guys--and you guys are the Van Halen brothers."
10:23;10:25;"I mean, come on."
10:25;10:27;"You want to know I'm the way I am?"
10:27;10:30;"'Cause I wasn't blessed with a name like that."""
10:30;10:33;"""It also makes me think of a Roth IRA."""
10:33;10:37;"""Right. When you hear my name, it makes you think of a retirement fund,"
10:37;10:40;"the least rock 'n' roll thing ever."
10:40;10:44;"You guys sound freaking badass, Van Halen brothers."""
10:44;10:48;"I did see a lot of outpouring from friends of the show."
10:48;10:53;"I saw CT and Baio both talking about how they tried to learn eruption"
10:53;10:57;"when they were children, like when they were learning to play music,"
10:57;11:00;"and how it made them better musicians."
11:00;11:04;"And I saw, like, a friend of the show, Brian Kopelman,"
11:04;11:07;"weighing in--he's a huge Van Halen head--Steven Hyden."
11:07;11:10;"A lot of friends of the show were really--"
11:10;11:14;"who were definitely Van Halen heads were going in."
11:14;11:18;"I bet. Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've heard Baio talk about eruption in the past."
11:18;11:20;"I mean, can we throw on eruption?"
11:20;11:22;"That's just like a ""diddly-diddly-diddly-diddly,"" right?"
11:22;11:24;"Like, it's just crazy finger tapping."
11:24;11:31;"The first album opens with ""Runnin' with the Devil,"""
11:31;11:33;"then it goes into this."
11:33;11:36;"And then it goes into King's cover, ""You Really Got Me."""
11:37;11:40;"[guitar playing]"
11:40;11:42;"He has such a specific guitar tone."
11:42;11:43;"Yeah."
11:43;11:45;"It's heavy and light at the same time."
11:45;11:48;"It really cuts, but it's not super tame."
11:48;11:50;"It's warm, but it cuts."
11:50;11:51;"Yeah."
11:51;11:53;"It's got body."
11:53;11:56;"[guitar playing]"
12:04;12:06;"That just sounds like a synth to me."
12:06;12:09;"That just sounds like a Moog, where you're like, taking one of those--"
12:09;12:12;"I think Biden should walk out to this song."
12:12;12:14;"[laughs]"
12:14;12:15;"That'd be sick."
12:15;12:17;"He should play it off his iPhone."
12:17;12:20;"[guitar playing]"
12:20;12:28;"Oh, yeah, then he goes, like, full classical."
12:28;12:30;"Yeah."
12:30;12:33;"I can't even imagine trying to learn this."
12:33;12:37;"Well, Jake, you're going to want to drop it about 50% slower."
12:37;12:39;"Start there."
12:39;12:41;"Little by little, work your way up."
12:41;12:43;"You'll have it in about a week."
12:43;12:46;"[guitar playing]"
12:46;12:56;"And then it goes into--"
12:56;12:59;"[vocalizing]"
12:59;13:02;"What an amazing, like, opening to a career."
13:02;13:04;"I guess that's what you want from a debut album,"
13:04;13:06;"just, like, a statement of purpose."
13:06;13:08;"Track one, ""Runnin' With the Devil."""
13:08;13:12;"We're going to talk about the Devil, because we are a metal band."
13:12;13:14;"But we're, like, we're runnin' with the Devil."
13:14;13:15;"It's kind of fun."
13:15;13:18;"You get, like, that right mix of, like, badass but fun."
13:18;13:20;"And then it's, like, what else is this band about?"
13:20;13:23;"And it's, like, ""Eruption,"" shows another side."
13:23;13:25;"And then ""Kings,"" ""You Really Got Me,"""
13:25;13:27;"they did a [bleep]load of covers."
13:27;13:29;"I can't think of a successful rock band who, like,"
13:29;13:32;"did more covers than them as singles."
13:32;13:34;"And I know we've touched on this kind of thing before,"
13:34;13:39;"but, like, again, it's amazing that their first record came out in '78,"
13:39;13:42;"that ""Kings"" song was maybe, what, 12 years old, 13 years old?"
13:42;13:43;"Yeah."
13:43;13:46;"It's so funny, like, how the sound of rock changed so much"
13:46;13:49;"in that 12-, 13-year span."
13:49;13:51;"Because it really is, like--"
13:51;13:53;"It comes in heavy after ""Eruption."""
13:53;13:55;"It's like-- [vocalizing]"
13:55;13:56;"Matt, throw that on."
13:56;14:00;"[rock music]"
14:00;14:02;"That's a huge sound."
14:02;14:03;"Right."
14:03;14:12;"[rock music]"
14:12;14:15;"I mean, yeah, it makes the ""Kings"" version sound like it was, like,"
14:15;14:17;"on, like, an Edison cylinder."
14:17;14:19;"[laughs] Totally."
14:19;14:21;"I bet Daft Punk loves Van Halen."
14:21;14:23;"Oh, interesting. Wait, what's your theory there?"
14:23;14:26;"They had a song that has an ""Eruption""-type guitar solo."
14:26;14:27;"[vocalizing]"
14:27;14:30;"And there's just something, like, so technical and clean about it"
14:30;14:31;"that seems like--"
14:31;14:33;"Right. I hear you."
14:33;14:41;"[rock music]"
14:41;14:43;"Obviously, they saw the '80s coming."
14:43;14:44;"Yeah."
14:44;14:48;"All those little, like, false harmonics and stuff were so funny."
14:48;14:52;"I was also thinking, like, listening to ""Eruption,"""
14:52;14:55;"and, you know, thinking about them as, like, this major development"
14:55;14:58;"in, like, rock technology."
14:58;15:00;"Rock/guacamole technology."
15:00;15:04;"Like, hearing ""Eruption"" makes me think a little bit of, like,"
15:04;15:08;"a Hendrix solo, like ""Star-Spangled Banner"" at Woodstock."
15:08;15:10;"You know, he has some similar, like, dive bombs."
15:10;15:13;"Yeah. Or ""Page."" Yeah."
15:13;15:14;"Yeah, or ""Page."""
15:14;15:17;"And just those guys, their vibe is so, like,"
15:17;15:20;"kind of, like, earthy, comparatively."
15:20;15:23;"It makes me think of, like, cars or something."
15:23;15:25;"Maybe because of his European background."
15:25;15:27;"Not that Holland's especially known for cars,"
15:27;15:31;"but just, like, that vibe of just, like, fine-tuning a technology"
15:31;15:35;"just to make it, like, fly, drop some weight from the chassis,"
15:35;15:38;"and just, like, create this, like, new sound."
15:38;15:41;"It's like the supersonic version of those dudes."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:42;15:44;"And it's a matter of taste, but it's, like, you can picture him, like,"
15:44;15:47;"studying this and, like--"
15:47;15:49;"Yeah, I don't know. It just makes me think about it."
15:49;15:51;"If you were, like, a rock fan in '78,"
15:51;15:54;"it probably felt a little bit like going to a car show"
15:54;15:57;"and, like, seeing some game-changing new thing"
15:57;16:00;"that could go, like, way faster than even some, like,"
16:00;16:05;"heritage American car and, like, made less noise, you know?"
16:05;16:06;"It's louder but more powerful."
16:06;16:09;"Yeah. Louder, faster."
16:09;16:10;"European engineering."
16:10;16:13;"I was reading today that he got the--"
16:13;16:15;"You know that Led Zeppelin song ""Heartbreaker""?"
16:15;16:18;"There's that part where it's just Jimmy Page soloing"
16:18;16:19;"with no accompaniment."
16:19;16:20;"Kind of."
16:20;16:23;"And, like, Page is doing a lot of, like, hammer-ons and pull-offs"
16:23;16:26;"on, like, a really loud electric guitar."
16:26;16:28;"And then he just, like, took that vibe and just, like,"
16:28;16:30;"kind of what you said, like, streamlined it,"
16:30;16:31;"took it to the next level."
16:31;16:35;"You know what? I'm going to make another bizarre connection"
16:35;16:38;"because I'm also, like, picturing him figuring out"
16:38;16:43;"all this guacamole technology in his garage in Pasadena."
16:43;16:45;"And I'm just like, ""You know what, man?"
16:45;16:48;"He's grown up in the shadow of the jet propulsion laboratory"
16:48;16:50;"in the great state of California."""
16:50;16:53;"It's almost like I see him and his, like, obsession"
16:53;16:55;"with, like, the technical side of music."
16:55;16:58;"I'm like, ""Jet propulsion laboratory,"
16:58;17:01;"Steve Jobs and Wozniak in the garage."
17:01;17:04;"I'm going to throw Eddie Van Halen in as another"
17:04;17:09;"great Californian tech innovator of the 1970s."""
17:09;17:10;"I love it."
17:10;17:11;"You know what I mean?"
17:11;17:12;"Oh, absolutely."
17:12;17:15;"There's very few guitars that I think of that way."
17:15;17:18;"Yeah, probably back then it was, like, an arms race."
17:18;17:23;"Like, the guitar was still, like, the dominant instrument"
17:23;17:25;"of, like, popular music."
17:25;17:28;"And, like, you probably had, like, a Randy Rhoads come out."
17:28;17:31;"It's like every year there was, yeah, it was, like,"
17:31;17:34;"a very techie type of, like, competitive atmosphere."
17:34;17:36;"And then I feel like after Randy Rhoads died,"
17:36;17:38;"like, Ozzy got this other dude who was, like,"
17:38;17:39;"even faster than Randy Rhoads."
17:39;17:42;"Right, and a lot of those guys, like Satriani and Vi,"
17:42;17:46;"like, it ended up going down this dead end of just, like,"
17:46;17:50;"very cold, not very fun, but very accomplished music."
17:50;17:53;"And it's cool that, like, I guess we touched on this before,"
17:53;17:56;"but, like, it's cool that he was able to do both,"
17:56;17:59;"of, like, have this very accomplished technical music,"
17:59;18:02;"but also have it be really fun and, like,"
18:02;18:05;"fun and dumb in a cool way."
18:05;18:08;"Because there's a version of him without the songwriting"
18:08;18:12;"and without the band that coalesced around him and his brother,"
18:12;18:15;"where it's just kind of like your uncle being like,"
18:15;18:18;"""Man, I used to go see this band in Pasadena."""
18:18;18:20;"And actually, the guy still plays at Old Town Pub sometimes."
18:20;18:24;"I swear he's the fastest, most technical guitar player I've ever seen."
18:24;18:25;"Oh, totally."
18:25;18:29;"They cover the kinks a lot, but he'll take these crazy solos."
18:29;18:30;"Just, like, a really solid cover band."
18:30;18:33;"He just could never figure it out what to do besides that."
18:33;18:35;"But, yeah, his name's Eddie Van Halen."
18:35;18:38;"Great guy. I'll bring him by the next Richard Pictures show."
18:38;18:40;"I bet he'd love you guys."
18:40;18:45;"I mean, he wasn't much of a deadhead, but I think he'd like you guys."
18:45;18:49;"Eddie Van Halen just sitting there with a dead cover band."
18:49;18:51;"Just like, ""Whoa, chill, man."""
18:51;18:53;"God, I wonder if Jerry--"
18:53;18:55;"I mean, it begs the question."
18:55;19:02;"It begs the question, did Jerry ever interface or listen to Van Halen?"
19:02;19:04;"Or vice versa."
19:04;19:11;"I mean, you could imagine a Euro-California technician like Eddie Van Halen, maybe--"
19:11;19:15;"It's really lame when people refer to the dead as being sloppy."
19:15;19:18;"Because, first of all, they're really not that sloppy."
19:18;19:22;"There just aren't that many bands where you have access to that much of their live music."
19:22;19:24;"Because, actually, you know what's interesting?"
19:24;19:26;"Jerry started as a technician, too."
19:26;19:30;"Maybe similar to Eddie Van Halen, two California technicians,"
19:30;19:36;"when he played banjo, according to that book I keep referencing, Dark Star, the oral biography,"
19:36;19:43;"he kind of hit the ceiling of just being as technically accomplished of a picker as he could be."
19:43;19:46;"Because bluegrass is incredibly technical music."
19:46;19:51;"Obviously, there's a lot of soul and energy and vibe in bluegrass music,"
19:51;19:56;"but when you see a shredder bluegrass band, that is some Van Halen sh*t."
19:56;20:02;"Bluegrass is up there with metal and classical music for just pure shredding."
20:02;20:07;"And apparently, Jerry, he was known as the best picker in Northern California,"
20:07;20:12;"and part of him moving to guitar was a little bit to challenge himself just to learn something new."
20:12;20:18;"So I believe this is Jerry talking to Fretz magazine in 1985,"
20:18;20:21;"and the question is, ""Do you ever listen to people like Eddie Van Halen?"""
20:21;20:25;"And his response is, ""Not seriously, no, because I can hear what's happening in there."
20:25;20:30;"There isn't much there that interests me. It isn't played with enough deliberateness,"
20:30;20:34;"and it lacks a certain kind of rhythmic elegance that I like music to have,"
20:34;20:41;"that I like notes to have. There's a lot of notes and stuff, but the notes aren't saying much, you know?"
20:41;20:45;"They're a little like clusters. It's a certain kind of music which I understand on one level,"
20:45;20:47;"but it isn't attractive to me."""
20:47;20:52;"Fair. Well, I was saying before, it's lame when people say, ""Oh, the jazz is sloppy, I'm not into that."""
20:52;20:57;"But I could imagine Eddie Van Halen saying that, and he's one of the few people on earth where"
20:57;21:02;"Eddie Van Halen was like, ""I checked out Europe '72. Sloppy as hell. Doesn't interest me."""
21:02;21:05;"You'd have to be like, ""All right, fair. You're Eddie Van Halen."""
21:05;21:15;"Yeah, and he'd be like, ""It doesn't rock. I'm not interested in this Americana blend of country and psych."""
21:15;21:19;"It's not... he's not interested in that."
21:19;21:23;"I think we also, of course, have to note, I'm sure many TC heads know this,"
21:23;21:28;"but Eddie Van Halen also played the guitar solo on ""Beat It"" off Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."""
21:28;21:31;"The legend I've heard is it was the first take."
21:31;21:32;"Crazy."
21:32;21:36;"That could be, you know, apocryphal, but that's the story I've heard."
21:36;21:41;"There's also so few examples of that. I mean, it goes to show that he really wasn't a class of his own,"
21:41;21:46;"but it's like, if you didn't know that, and even if you just kind of recall what that guitar solo sounds like in your head,"
21:46;21:50;"you're like, ""Of course, who else could have played that? It's such a specific sound."""
21:50;21:55;"Can we throw that on? Just like, ""Beat It"" and rub forward to the solo?"
21:55;21:57;"OK."
22:00;22:03;"[applause]"
22:32;22:34;"That's shorter than I remember."
22:34;22:35;"Yeah."
22:35;22:42;"I hate to disagree with Jerry, but that solo really is a combination of clusters of notes, technical prowess,"
22:42;22:45;"but I would say that that solo actually says something."
22:45;22:48;"It told a little story, the same way that Jerry would."
22:48;22:52;"You know, it had personality, it had a narrative."
22:52;22:56;"It wasn't just coming in with the crazy arpeggios."
22:56;23:01;"He used them tastefully. He built a kind of little story around them."
23:01;23:04;"And there was a couple of long bends there."
23:04;23:06;"Yeah, such a unique sound."
23:06;23:12;"And I was just thinking, how many examples are there like that of a gigantic pop song"
23:12;23:16;"where they bring in a famous guitarist to add some personality?"
23:16;23:22;"His guitar has as much personality as Michael Jackson's voice does in Quincy's production, all this stuff."
23:22;23:29;"My mind goes to, it's a totally different scenario, but Santana featuring Rob Thomas with ""Smooth,"""
23:29;23:37;"that's a big song where it's not just an iconic guitar hook, but you can kind of recall some of the soloing."
23:37;23:41;"Sorry, I just was curious about that ""Beat It"" solo, and I just Googled it."
23:41;23:43;"I did a little number crunching on my own."
23:43;23:44;"Oh, nice."
23:44;23:48;"Apparently, Michael Jackson had asked Pete Townshend to do it originally."
23:48;23:49;"Whoa."
23:49;23:51;"You don't think of him as a soloist."
23:51;23:55;"Brilliant songwriter and very talented guitarist."
23:55;23:59;"And then Townshend, he couldn't do it, but he recommended Van Halen."
23:59;24:00;"Whoa."
24:00;24:01;"Weird."
24:01;24:07;"I'm on a CNN article that interviews Van Halen about the phone call from Quincy in the whole studio session."
24:07;24:09;"It's pretty fascinating."
24:09;24:11;"Jake, I just texted it to the group."
24:11;24:13;"I feel like you should take this."
24:13;24:15;"All right."
24:15;24:21;"Go from CNN, when Quincy rang you up, you thought it was a crank call."
24:21;24:24;"So CNN, I like the interviewer is CNN."
24:24;24:28;"CNN, when Quincy rang you up, you thought it was a crank call."
24:28;24:30;"Eddie Van Halen, I went off on him."
24:30;24:32;"I went, ""What do you want?"
24:32;24:34;"You effing so-and-so?"""
24:34;24:35;"And he says, ""Is this Eddie?"""
24:35;24:38;"And I said, ""Yeah, what the hell do you want?"""
24:38;24:40;"This is Quincy."
24:40;24:43;"I'm thinking to myself, ""I don't know any name Quincy."""
24:43;24:45;"He goes, ""Quincy Jones, man."""
24:45;24:47;"I went, ""Oh, sorry."""
24:47;24:48;"Laugh."
24:48;24:50;"I said, ""What can I do for you?"""
24:50;24:53;"He said, ""How would you like to come down and play on Michael Jackson's new record?"""
24:53;24:58;"I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay, ABC, 1, 2, 3, and me."
24:58;24:59;"How's that going to work?"""
24:59;25:01;"Because he's thinking of Jackson 5 stuff."
25:01;25:05;"Off the wall, it had been a huge album a couple years earlier."
25:05;25:06;"All right."
25:06;25:07;"But he was in his own world."
25:07;25:09;"He was in the rock world."
25:09;25:10;"Exactly."
25:10;25:12;"I still wasn't 100% sure it was him."
25:12;25:14;"I said, ""I'll tell you what."
25:14;25:15;"I'll meet you at your studio tomorrow."""
25:15;25:19;"Lo and behold, when I get there, there's Quincy, there's Michael Jackson, and there's Engineers."
25:19;25:21;"They're making records."
25:21;25:22;"CNN."
25:22;25:27;"Did Quincy give you any direction about what he wanted you to do?"
25:27;25:28;"Van Halen."
25:28;25:32;"Michael left to go across the hall to do some children's speaking record."
25:32;25:33;"I think it was ET or something."
25:33;25:34;"Probably the ET record."
25:34;25:35;"I was just thinking that."
25:35;25:36;"Okay."
25:36;25:38;"So I asked Quincy, ""What do you want me to do?"""
25:38;25:40;"And he goes, ""Whatever you want to do."""
25:40;25:42;"And I go, ""Be careful what you say."
25:42;25:45;"If you know anything about me, be careful what you say, man."
25:45;25:46;"Do anything you want."
25:46;25:47;"Don't be crazy."""
25:47;25:50;"I listen to the song and I immediately go, ""Can I change some parts?"""
25:50;25:55;"I turn to the engineer and I go, ""Okay, from the breakdown, chop into this part."
25:55;25:57;"Go into this piece, pre-chorus to the chorus."""
25:57;26:02;"It took him maybe 10 minutes to put it together and I proceeded to improvise two solos over it."
26:02;26:05;"I was just finishing the second solo when Michael walked in."
26:05;26:07;"And you know artists are kind of crazy people."
26:07;26:09;"We're all a little bit strange."
26:09;26:13;"I didn't know how he would react to what I was doing, so I warned him before he listened."
26:13;26:16;"I said, ""Look, I changed the middle section of your song."""
26:16;26:18;"That's actually kind of crazy."
26:18;26:21;"He walks in and he's like, ""Can we actually just shift the structure around?"""
26:21;26:23;"Just commandeering the whole studio."
26:23;26:27;"I'm amazed that that only took 10 minutes in 1981, too."
26:27;26:29;"Yeah, with tape."
26:29;26:30;"No problem, Eddie."
26:30;26:36;"So he continues, ""Now in my mind, he's either going to have his bodyguards kick me out for butchering his song or he's going to like it."""
26:36;26:38;"So he gave it a listen and he turned to me and he said,"
26:38;26:45;"""Wow, thank you so much for having the passion not to come in and blaze a solo, but to actually care about the song and make it better."""
26:45;26:46;"Wow."
26:46;26:49;"""He was a musical genius with his childlike innocence."
26:49;26:52;"He was such a professional and such a sweetheart."""
26:52;26:54;"Wait, now he's talking about Nirvana? Hold on."
26:54;26:58;"Is there an album since then that has shaken things up in the same way?"
26:58;27:00;"Oh, I don't know. CNN."
27:00;27:04;"Some people cite Nirvana's ""Nevermind"" as one that has caused a musical shift."
27:04;27:05;"Van Halen."
27:05;27:07;"But still not like that."
27:07;27:09;"Not that it crossed over to such a mass audience."
27:09;27:11;"Nirvana was huge, but it didn't appeal to everyone."
27:11;27:13;"Anyway, whatever. That's not that interesting."
27:13;27:16;"Wait, now he's comparing Nirvana to Michael Jackson?"
27:16;27:24;"No, no, no. CNN went into this thing of how Thriller was this huge record and everyone loved it."
27:24;27:31;"And then CNN was trying to fish a little bit and was like, ""Well, what else do you think has changed music? What about Nirvana?"""
27:31;27:37;"And Van Halen is sort of like, ""Yeah, sure. They're playing punk rock, man."" To quote Uncle Ted."
27:40;27:45;"Yeah, and you can imagine why just some punk rock might not be that appealing to Eddie Van Halen."
27:45;27:46;"Yeah."
27:46;27:51;"Well, R.I.P. Eddie Van Halen. Hell of a career."
27:51;27:52;"Rest in power."
27:52;27:57;"Right. We were talking on the thread. Seinfeld, you brought this up. It seems like everybody says ""rest in power"" these days."
27:57;28:04;"Yeah, I just feel like I've noticed this year that ""Rest in Peace"" is not cool. It's out. Now it's ""Rest in Power."""
28:04;28:16;"My guess on the thread was, because you were saying, ""Where does this come from?"" I mean, it really sounds like, I would have guessed it might have its roots in the Black Panther era of African-American activism."
28:16;28:23;"Then we found some article that said it didn't go back that far, but still implied that it kind of came from black activism."
28:23;28:34;"And as a lot of words do become appropriated by, such as the word ""woke"" also kind of came from a smaller niche and suddenly everybody talks about it."
28:34;28:48;"But yeah, ""rest in power"" really seems like a political thing. Race aside, because I don't know exactly where it comes from, it does seem like way more, you know, it sounds like when Nelson Mandela dies, ""rest in power."""
28:48;28:58;"I feel like the implication is like, somebody who was dedicated to a struggle for equal rights or something, you know, the idea of just saying, ""Oh, rest in peace, take it easy now."""
28:58;29:05;"It's like, no, no, power feels more appropriate because you were looking for power for the people, you know, you're struggling not over."
29:05;29:15;"It feels kind of like, yeah, like you're still giving them hell in the afterlife. Like your power sustains, you know, beyond the grave."
29:15;29:22;"Especially when you consider the long history, obviously, of activists being murdered and killed by the powers that be."
29:22;29:27;"It's important to recognize that just because somebody's dead doesn't mean the struggle's over."
29:27;29:32;"It is strange that now people seem to use it for literally everybody who dies."
29:32;29:40;"Although weirdly, I would say like Eddie Van Halen, it makes me think of like power chords. At least he came from the world of like metal."
29:40;29:42;"Very powerful tone."
29:42;29:48;"At least his life was associated with power in a way. Is power metal a thing? I'm going to do a number crunch."
29:48;29:49;"Power metal."
29:49;29:57;"Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often with some phonetic context."
29:57;29:59;"Who are the big power metal bands?"
29:59;30:05;"I guess they're saying Queensryche and Fate's Warning were progressive metal bands."
30:05;30:11;"And then they influenced bands like Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steel, Riot, or Jagged Panzer."
30:11;30:14;"Oh yeah. Love those bands."
30:14;30:16;"Halloween, Running Wild."
30:16;30:23;"Okay, but either way, power seems like an appropriate word to associate with Eddie Van Halen."
30:23;30:25;"Speaking of metal, Peace sells."
30:25;30:27;"But who's buying?"
30:27;30:29;"Wait, Jake, do you know what that is?"
30:29;30:32;"Uh, remind me."
30:32;30:36;"It's an album from 1986 called Peace Sells. Dot, dot, dot."
30:36;30:38;"But who's buying?"
30:38;30:40;"Is it a metal record?"
30:40;30:42;"It's an American heavy metal band."
30:42;30:44;"Do I know the name of the band? Are they famous?"
30:44;30:45;"Yes."
30:45;30:49;"I'm not a metal guy. It's not Slayer, because I know they did Rain and Blood in '86."
30:49;30:55;"This band's first album came out in 1985, and it also had an ellipsis. It was called Killing is My Business, dot, dot, dot."
30:55;30:57;"And business is good."
30:57;30:59;"Oh my god."
30:59;31:02;"They're so focused on commerce."
31:02;31:04;"It's not Queensryche, right?"
31:04;31:05;"No."
31:05;31:10;"And then their third album is called So Far, Comma, So Good, dot, dot, dot. So what?"
31:10;31:12;"Oh my god."
31:12;31:15;"Their fourth album is called Rust in Peace, 1990."
31:15;31:18;"Their fifth album, 1992, is called Countdown to Extinction."
31:18;31:19;"Oh, Megadeth."
31:19;31:21;"Yeah, Megadeth."
31:21;31:26;"Megadeth. Oh my god, those first two album titles are so brutal."
31:26;31:29;"I don't know why that I've always... You know what, I gotta go listen to this album."
31:29;31:33;"I feel like there's a lot of things that seem very appealing to me about Megadeth."
31:33;31:36;"It's one of the most psychotic band names."
31:36;31:40;"What's the top played Megadeth song on, like, Apple Music?"
31:40;31:43;"Like, I can't even name one Megadeth song. Can you?"
31:43;31:45;"No, but I can sing one."
31:45;31:50;"I can sing one bassline because they always used to use this as, like, a bumper on MTV."
31:50;31:54;"And it went, ""Bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow, bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow, ba-dow."""
31:54;31:57;"And I would hear that, you know, growing up because they would use it for, like, MTV News."
31:57;31:59;"""Bow, ba-dow, bow, bow, ba-dow, ba-dow."""
31:59;32:02;"And then finally I heard it, and I was like, ""Oh, it's a Megadeth song. Sick."""
32:02;32:05;"Played Megadeth's top song on Apple Music."
32:05;32:11;"Killing is my business."
32:11;32:13;"Business is good."
32:13;32:16;"Terrible."
32:16;32:27;"You take a model man."
32:27;32:28;"Oh my god."
32:28;32:31;"What year is this?"
32:31;32:33;"That vocal texture is so buff."
32:33;32:35;"Is this from '92?"
32:35;32:40;"God, this sucks."
32:40;32:43;"I'm not that mad at it."
32:43;32:45;"It's awful."
32:45;32:47;"I mean, it's kind of interesting."
32:47;32:54;"Like, bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden were, like, just miles beyond these guys."
32:54;32:58;"I can hear a little bit of Alice in Chains in there, but Alice in Chains could, like, write songs and sing."
32:58;33:02;"Well, hold on. You're just basing that off one Megadeth song."
33:02;33:06;"Okay, let's turn this into a Megadeth episode. Fans would love that."
33:06;33:10;"Play the title track off Peace Sells, but who's buying?"
33:10;33:12;"Play track three, Peace Sells."
33:12;33:14;"That's the one that I know."
33:14;33:19;"I'm into this. Do you remember this? They always play this on MTV."
33:36;33:38;"This kind of sounds like Primus."
33:38;33:40;"This is so Beavis and Butthead."
33:40;33:42;"Oh yeah, it's so Beavis and Butthead."
33:42;33:44;"Vocals are so low in the mix."
33:44;33:46;"What do you mean?"
33:46;33:48;"I like this."
33:56;33:58;"I'd put this on the two Megadeth."
33:58;33:59;"Hell yeah."
33:59;34:01;"Peace Sells, but who's buying? I love that title."
34:01;34:07;"Anyway, I hope there are no hardcore Van Halen fans who, like, hate Megadeth."
34:07;34:10;"I don't know if that's, like, offensive to a Van Halen fan to get into Megadeth."
34:10;34:14;"Or maybe there's, like, some shared fandom."
34:14;34:20;"But, Jake, before we started paying tribute to the absolute legend Eddie Van Halen,"
34:20;34:25;"you said that you had the Wikipedia cracked open for Jolly Ranchers."
34:25;34:26;"That is true."
34:26;34:29;"I don't know about you guys. We'll let people..."
34:29;34:32;"I feel like lately we've been referencing the thread a lot on this show."
34:32;34:34;"You know, we've been doing this show for a long time now."
34:34;34:37;"It's okay to, you know, peel back the curtain a little bit."
34:37;34:38;"Yeah."
34:38;34:41;"We're going to have a friend of the show, Daniel Ralston, on,"
34:41;34:43;"I believe for the first time, actually, on air."
34:43;34:44;"I think so, yeah."
34:44;34:49;"He's going to be giving us a review of the new Hershey's/Yingling beer."
34:49;34:53;"We don't have bottles ourselves. We'll be trying that subsequently."
34:53;34:56;"But on the thread, I asked if we could hit up our..."
34:56;35:00;"Now that we're, you know, have a great contact at Hershey's,"
35:00;35:03;"I asked if they could hook us up with this new Hershey's beer."
35:03;35:04;"And they said okay."
35:04;35:08;"And then Matt, our producer, sent us a picture of a sneaker and said,"
35:08;35:10;"""And also they'd like to send you guys these."
35:10;35:15;"These are the Kawhi Leonard Jolly Rancher New Balances."
35:15;35:20;"As always, in 2020, a collab needs three participants."
35:20;35:22;"Two is boring."""
35:22;35:24;"So we have the NBA star Kawhi Leonard,"
35:24;35:28;"the sneaker company New Balance, and Jolly Rancher."
35:28;35:29;"And I don't know about you guys,"
35:29;35:33;"but before I could take in the breathtaking beauty of the sneaker,"
35:33;35:37;"my first thought was, ""Wait, does Hershey's own Jolly Ranchers?"""
35:37;35:38;"I didn't know that."
35:38;35:41;"And I feel like the Jolly Ranchers branding, you don't think..."
35:41;35:44;"Right? Like, Hershey's just seems like a chocolate company."
35:44;35:48;"You don't think about it being fruit-flavored lozenges."
35:48;35:52;"It'd be like if Hershey's, you know, sold, like, own Skittles."
35:52;35:54;"It'd be like, ""What?"""
35:54;35:55;"Yeah, especially because, like..."
35:55;35:56;"What the f***?"
35:56;35:57;"[laughter]"
35:57;35:59;"Rare F-bomb from the South."
35:59;36:01;"I'm sorry, but it would be upsetting."
36:01;36:06;"I think especially because, like most people, you know,"
36:06;36:08;"most people want to keep their chocolate candy"
36:08;36:10;"separate from their fruity candy."
36:10;36:12;"I can think of a few weird things."
36:12;36:14;"I feel like growing up in my grandparents' house,"
36:14;36:18;"they always had, like, chocolate-covered orange peel kind of candy."
36:18;36:19;"Gross."
36:19;36:21;"And it's definitely not for everybody."
36:21;36:23;"And I feel like that's a thing you hear a lot."
36:23;36:25;"People say, ""I don't like my chocolate and my fruit mixed up."
36:25;36:26;"I'm disgusted by it."""
36:26;36:27;"Big time."
36:27;36:28;"And I even... Is this..."
36:28;36:30;"Seinfeld, is this like a meme or something?"
36:30;36:31;"Or is this like a prank?"
36:31;36:34;"You take a big thing of Skittles and a big thing of M&Ms"
36:34;36:36;"and you mix them up in a bowl?"
36:36;36:40;"I saw one tweet about that, weirdly enough, last week."
36:40;36:46;"And I think the phrase was, ""My aunt mixed M&Ms and Skittles"
36:46;36:47;"and it's the most chaotic..."""
36:47;36:49;"You know how people say ""chaotic"" now?"
36:49;36:52;"Like, ""the most chaotic evil I've ever seen."""
36:52;36:54;"""The most chaotic evil I've ever seen."""
36:54;36:55;"Something like that."
36:55;36:57;"I've never... I haven't seen it replicated,"
36:57;37:00;"but maybe there was one single sort of mega tweet about that."
37:00;37:01;"This is a thing."
37:01;37:02;"I think it goes back years."
37:02;37:05;"Maybe it's also just for the average American child"
37:05;37:07;"of a certain age, perhaps."
37:07;37:09;"I don't know if kids still eat candy."
37:09;37:12;"But the idea of mixing up Skittles and M&Ms"
37:12;37:14;"is just like so disturbing..."
37:14;37:15;"Gross."
37:15;37:17;"...to a red-blooded American kid."
37:17;37:20;"Can I read you one sentence off this Wikipedia page"
37:20;37:22;"that I think is so indicative of like"
37:22;37:24;"kind of late capitalist situation?"
37:24;37:25;"Sure."
37:25;37:26;"There's a..."
37:26;37:28;"called ""Acquisitions"""
37:28;37:30;"on the Jolly Rancher Wikipedia page."
37:30;37:32;"And it's one sentence long."
37:32;37:33;"And it says,"
37:33;37:37;"""In 2002, Hershey closed the Wheat Ridge, Colorado plant"
37:37;37:39;"and moved the manufacturing of the candy to Mexico"
37:39;37:41;"to save costs."""
37:41;37:42;"Wow."
37:42;37:47;"Because it was founded in Golden, Colorado in 1949."
37:47;37:49;"So from 1949 to 2002,"
37:49;37:52;"Jolly Ranchers were made in the USA"
37:52;37:54;"in Colorado."
37:54;37:56;"Wait, is Golden, Colorado also where like"
37:56;37:58;"Coors is from or some beer company?"
37:58;38:00;"It's something from that region of the world."
38:00;38:01;"I don't know if it's Golden."
38:01;38:03;"That's right. You're right."
38:03;38:04;"It is Coors."
38:04;38:07;"Whoa, Golden, Colorado is like the Silicon Valley"
38:07;38:09;"of beer and candy."
38:09;38:11;"That's two pretty big things"
38:11;38:13;"to be come out of one town."
38:13;38:15;"Well, I also think that I'm..."
38:15;38:18;"If I'm recalling my research from years ago,"
38:18;38:21;"I want to say Wild Oats came from Golden, Colorado."
38:21;38:24;"Wild Oats was the like competitor to Whole Foods"
38:24;38:26;"for a good 20 years."
38:26;38:28;"And then Whole Foods eventually bought them."
38:28;38:29;"I'm going to take this all the way."
38:29;38:31;"That's correct."
38:31;38:32;"Wow."
38:32;38:33;"Wait, so what is..."
38:33;38:36;"Is Golden, Colorado just like a suburb of Denver?"
38:36;38:37;"Yes, I think it's like..."
38:37;38:39;"It is adjacent to Denver,"
38:39;38:41;"but I think there's like a cool college there."
38:41;38:43;"And I think it's like a little bit of like..."
38:43;38:45;"It's a former Gold Rush town."
38:45;38:47;"It's a mountain town, right."
38:47;38:50;"I think it's maintained some degree of like"
38:50;38:51;"hippie crunchiness."
38:51;38:54;"Yeah, I mean, you hear so much about Boulger."
38:54;38:55;"Yes."
38:55;38:57;"I think it is part of greater Denver."
38:57;38:59;"I've been to Denver many times,"
38:59;39:00;"but it's always on tour."
39:00;39:03;"So like I rarely get to kind of explore greater Denver."
39:03;39:05;"It's a fascinating area."
39:05;39:08;"It's also always amazed me how..."
39:08;39:11;"When Red Rocks, which is in Morrison, Colorado,"
39:11;39:13;"and you know, anybody's ever been to Red Rocks,"
39:13;39:14;"or even seen pictures,"
39:14;39:16;"it's like one of the most like"
39:16;39:19;"breathtaking venues in America,"
39:19;39:21;"you know, carved into this rock."
39:21;39:23;"You're in like this, I think a state park,"
39:23;39:24;"but it's like amazing."
39:24;39:26;"You're like, as far as the eye can see,"
39:26;39:29;"it's like this kind of like beautiful, rugged terrain."
39:29;39:32;"And, you know, usually when we play at Red Rocks,"
39:32;39:35;"we like stay in Denver, you know, like jump in a van."
39:35;39:38;"And we're like there in like 35 minutes."
39:38;39:39;"And it's really wild."
39:39;39:41;"Because like, yeah, the Red Rocks,"
39:41;39:45;"whatever the beautiful outdoor natural amphitheater"
39:45;39:47;"of a lot of cities might be hours outside."
39:47;39:50;"Right. That's cool."
39:50;39:53;"But clearly, Golden, Colorado is where it's at."
39:53;39:56;"Did you find anything else out about Jolly Ranchers?"
39:56;39:57;"When did they start making them?"
39:57;39:59;"1949."
39:59;40:04;"Bill and Dorothy Harmsman founded the company."
40:04;40:06;"They wanted to give the impression of it being"
40:06;40:08;"a friendly Western company."
40:08;40:09;"Okay."
40:09;40:10;"And also it's a rancher."
40:10;40:11;"Yeah."
40:11;40:12;"That implies the West, right?"
40:12;40:17;"Like, you know, if it had been founded in 1907 in Connecticut,"
40:17;40:19;"it might be called like the Happy Farmer."
40:19;40:23;"But this was founded in a gold rush town out in the Rockies."
40:23;40:25;"So it was a Jolly Rancher."
40:25;40:27;"I can give you a little breakdown of the chemistry if you'd like."
40:27;40:28;"Yeah, the technology."
40:28;40:30;"Oh, yeah, please. Let's get into the tech."
40:30;40:32;"Okay. Well, they're amorphous solids,"
40:32;40:36;"meaning their molecular arrangements have no specific pattern."
40:36;40:40;"They are hard, of course, rigid, translucent,"
40:40;40:42;"and have low molecular mobility."
40:42;40:46;"Jolly Ranchers are formed from highly concentrated sugar solutions,"
40:46;40:49;"greater than 95% sugar, and have extremely high viscosity."
40:49;40:53;"Their glassy appearance is a result of the way they are processed."
40:53;40:56;"During processing, the sugar syrup is cooled so rapidly"
40:56;40:59;"that no crystals have time to form."
40:59;41:02;"Jolly Ranchers hold their shape and kept in temperatures"
41:02;41:04;"less than the glass transition temperature."
41:04;41:07;"If the temperature is greater than the glass transition temperature,"
41:07;41:09;"the hard and glassy-like structure of the Jolly Rancher"
41:09;41:12;"will break down and become soft and rubbery."
41:12;41:15;"So a little, you know, chemistry background there."
41:15;41:18;"[laughter]"
41:18;41:21;"Isn't Jolly Rancher, like, a primary ingredient in drink?"
41:21;41:23;"Oh, yeah. There is a thing where people would, like,"
41:23;41:27;"melt Jolly Ranchers and use it to make alcohol."
41:27;41:33;"Well, I can tell you that something that is very popular on TikTok"
41:33;41:37;"that my kids are very into is a viral video where people"
41:37;41:41;"prank other people by boiling the Jolly Ranchers down,"
41:41;41:43;"putting someone's phone inside of them"
41:43;41:47;"to make a giant Jolly Rancher and then putting it into the freezer."
41:47;41:51;"So their phone is now trapped in a giant Jolly Rancher."
41:51;41:53;"Does it ruin the phone?"
41:53;41:55;"It ruins the phone."
41:55;41:57;"[laughter]"
41:57;41:59;"So the prank is destroying people's phones?"
41:59;42:03;"Yeah. It would be a sick prank if it didn't ruin the phone."
42:03;42:05;"And you had to, like, eat--"
42:05;42:07;"Hammer through or eat through this giant Jolly Rancher."
42:07;42:08;"Yeah, no, it would be sick if it--"
42:08;42:10;"Maybe it doesn't always ruin the phone."
42:10;42:14;"If you could see through the translucent amorphous molecular structure"
42:14;42:16;"and you could see that your phone was working"
42:16;42:18;"and, in fact, you see you're getting texted"
42:18;42:21;"and you're like, ""Uh,"" and you want to bust it"
42:21;42:23;"and you're like, ""Hold on a sec."
42:23;42:26;"If you grab a hammer or you throw this shit against the, you know,"
42:26;42:29;"the f***ing corner of the table, you might break your phone."""
42:29;42:31;"And it's like, ""Well, how do I get to this s***?"""
42:31;42:32;"And it's like, ""Start licking."""
42:32;42:34;"That would be a sick prank."
42:34;42:36;"We've got to figure out a way to do this prank where it doesn't destroy the phone."
42:36;42:39;"Well, I think that there's a version where you just put it inside--"
42:39;42:41;"The start lick is shell."
42:41;42:42;"--a ziplock."
42:42;42:43;"It's sort of the safer way to do it."
42:43;42:45;"And I would imagine it keeps it working."
42:45;42:48;"I don't think freezing a phone hurts it, does it?"
42:48;42:52;"Obviously, the heat, you know, can turn it off, but--"
42:52;42:55;"The, like, molten Jolly Rancher is what destroys the phone."
42:55;42:56;"[laughs]"
42:56;42:57;"Cool prank."
42:57;42:59;"""Hey, Ezra, I stole your phone."""
42:59;43:00;"Start lick."
43:00;43:01;"[laughs]"
43:01;43:04;"""I stole your phone and I put it in my Vitamix"
43:04;43:07;"and now I just sprinkled it in with these eggs."
43:07;43:09;"I made you an omelet of your phone."""
43:09;43:15;"[laughs]"
43:15;43:16;"The phone is destroyed."
43:16;43:18;"Yeah, you can't use your phone anymore."
43:18;43:20;"The phone is destroyed."
44:11;44:14;"Well, speaking of beverages, it's time to get on the phone"
44:14;44:16;"with a friend of the show, Daniel Ralston."
44:16;44:20;"As you'll recall, he has the Hershey's Yingling beer"
44:20;44:22;"in his possession."
44:22;44:24;"Also, it was his great call to do a country top five"
44:24;44:26;"on the last episode."
44:26;44:29;"So let's get him on the horn and see what he has to say."
44:29;44:32;"Are we sure that he has the beer in his possession?"
44:32;44:33;"Yes, I believe so."
44:33;44:34;"Well, we're about to find out."
44:34;44:37;"And he posted, like, a stock photo of it."
44:37;44:38;"Okay, well, great."
44:38;44:39;"Plenty to talk about."
44:39;44:43;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
44:43;44:46;"[phone ringing]"
44:46;44:47;"Hello."
44:47;44:48;"Daniel."
44:48;44:49;"Hi."
44:49;44:51;"Welcome to the show."
44:51;44:53;"Okay, right off the bat, first question."
44:53;44:56;"Do you have the Hershey's beer in your possession?"
44:56;44:58;"I have the Hershey's beer in my possession."
44:58;44:59;"Oh, okay."
44:59;45:00;"Beautiful."
45:00;45:03;"A few questions first, because you're the one who put this"
45:03;45:05;"on our radar."
45:05;45:08;"So this came to you via your family,"
45:08;45:10;"or did you already know about it?"
45:10;45:13;"I saw something about it in my, like, random Google News feed,"
45:13;45:17;"and they were advertising it as 300 years of Pennsylvania"
45:17;45:20;"history, because both Hershey's and Yengling have been around"
45:20;45:22;"for, like, 150-plus years."
45:22;45:25;"And I called my parents, and I said,"
45:25;45:26;"""Can you find this for me?"
45:26;45:27;"I want to try it."""
45:27;45:30;"And my dad was like, ""I already saw it at Wegmans."
45:30;45:32;"It's being pushed very hard at the grocery store."""
45:32;45:34;"So he sent me some right away."
45:34;45:36;"You're from Pennsylvania, right?"
45:36;45:37;"Yeah, I'm from Allentown."
45:37;45:42;"Growing up, did Hershey's and Yengling loom large for you?"
45:42;45:45;"Yeah, I probably went to Hershey Park, like, 30 times as a kid."
45:45;45:48;"It's like an hour and a half from where I grew up."
45:48;45:50;"I saw some of my first concerts there,"
45:50;45:53;"including Dave Matthews Band in 1994."
45:53;45:54;"Oh, really?"
45:54;45:57;"Because they have, like, an amphitheater at Hershey Park?"
45:57;45:58;"They do."
45:58;46:00;"Actually, it's one of the famous shows that Radiohead opened"
46:00;46:03;"for Alanis Morissette was at Hershey Park."
46:03;46:05;"So you're telling me Tom York has been to Hershey PA."
46:05;46:08;"He's been to Hershey PA, for sure."
46:08;46:11;"I wonder if Radiohead got the VIP Factory Tour."
46:11;46:13;"There's a song they play on the Factory Tour that's pretty legendary."
46:13;46:16;"I hope they worked it into one of their songs later."
46:16;46:17;"What are some of the lyrics?"
46:17;46:20;"It's like an original composition about Hershey's?"
46:20;46:24;"♪ Hershey's chocolate's a Hershey's chocolate world ♪"
46:24;46:26;"♪ Wherever you go, no matter how far ♪"
46:26;46:30;"♪ You're always near a Hershey bar ♪"
46:30;46:32;"Okay, that's pretty good."
46:32;46:33;"Yeah."
46:33;46:37;"And have you ever tasted, like, a hot off the presses"
46:37;46:40;"Reese's Peanut Butter Cup?"
46:40;46:42;"No, I haven't."
46:42;46:45;"One time I did the tour, and one of the big draws of the Hershey Park tour"
46:45;46:48;"is that they give you, like, a full-size candy bar at the end."
46:48;46:50;"This is probably the last time I went."
46:50;46:55;"It was, like, in the mid-90s, and they gave me a Desert Storm bar,"
46:55;47:00;"which was the candy bar created to withstand high temperatures."
47:00;47:04;"Oh, wait. I feel like this briefly came up when we were researching that--"
47:04;47:07;"'cause, you know, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup's have different formulas"
47:07;47:09;"in summer and winter."
47:09;47:11;"And I feel like this came up at some time in our research."
47:11;47:14;"I don't think we really talked about it too much on the show."
47:14;47:16;"So this was during the Gulf War."
47:16;47:20;"Even the American summer formula wasn't enough to withstand"
47:20;47:23;"that real intense Iraqi heat."
47:23;47:27;"Exactly. And I remember it came in, like, a tan wrapper."
47:27;47:29;"-You know, it had, like, a military look. -Oh, like military."
47:29;47:31;"-Yeah. -Did it say, like, Desert Storm bar?"
47:31;47:33;"That's what it was called, I'm pretty sure."
47:33;47:36;"When I typed in Desert Storm Hershey bar,"
47:36;47:41;"the first thing that comes up on Google is one for sale on eBay."
47:41;47:46;"They're asking for $24.95 plus $3.50 shipping."
47:46;47:48;"It says ""condition used."""
47:48;47:50;"[laughter]"
47:50;47:52;"And it ships from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
47:52;47:54;"-Nice. -Did it cross your mind as a kid"
47:54;47:56;"when they gave you that? Weren't you kind of like,"
47:56;48:00;"""I really think this should be with a soldier in Iraq right now""?"
48:00;48:03;"Like, why did they have them back home?"
48:03;48:06;"I was more concerned with the fact that I wanted"
48:06;48:08;"a new candy bar that had recently come out"
48:08;48:10;"that had M&Ms inside of a chocolate bar,"
48:10;48:12;"and I got the Desert Storm bar instead."
48:12;48:14;"And I just remember being super disappointed"
48:14;48:16;"and putting it straight in the trash,"
48:16;48:18;"which might be the most disrespectful thing to the troops."
48:18;48:20;"[laughter]"
48:20;48:22;"Yeah, you should have mailed it."
48:22;48:23;"[laughter]"
48:23;48:25;"Whoa. Oh, my God. Also looking on eBay."
48:25;48:28;"I love that a significant element of time crisis now"
48:28;48:30;"is just listening to people look at eBay."
48:30;48:33;"[laughter]"
48:33;48:37;"But I found-- Okay, so that was one for $35."
48:37;48:41;"Here's one. It's in California, so it'll get there faster."
48:41;48:45;"This is a lot of 33 1991 Hershey's Desert Bar"
48:45;48:48;"Gulf War chocolates. They're asking $585."
48:48;48:50;"But if you use PayPal credit,"
48:50;48:53;"you can do $51 a month for 12 months."
48:53;48:56;"Do I only get a certain number per month, too, as I pay,"
48:56;48:58;"or do I get them all at once?"
48:58;49:00;"Oh, if the seller's smart, they won't give you them all at once."
49:00;49:03;"Those are 29-year-old candy bars."
49:03;49:05;"Yeah, made to withstand the elements."
49:05;49:07;"Ooh, here's one that's in the actual box."
49:07;49:11;"""Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm"
49:11;49:13;"""both ended before Hershey was even done"
49:13;49:15;"""producing the Desert Bars."
49:15;49:19;"""Only 144,000 bars even made it to the Middle East."
49:19;49:22;"""It sold the defunct MREs as novelty items"
49:22;49:24;"""until the supplies ran out"
49:24;49:26;"""and then discontinued the bar entirely."""
49:26;49:27;"Whoa."
49:27;49:30;"Is there a 2003 Iraq War bar?"
49:30;49:32;"Just bring them back with a new label."
49:32;49:33;"Right."
49:33;49:36;"Okay, now I'm remembering how somebody sent us an email."
49:36;49:38;"Apologies to whoever sent us this email."
49:38;49:39;"Seinfeld, maybe do a number crunch."
49:39;49:42;"Who sent us the email about Hershey's making bars for the military?"
49:42;49:44;"'Cause as I go deeper,"
49:44;49:47;"now I'm seeing World War II-era Hershey's bars"
49:47;49:50;"that were branded as Hershey's Tropical Chocolate,"
49:50;49:53;"that also they were probably sending to, you know,"
49:53;49:56;"like the Pacific Theater, maybe North Africa."
49:56;49:58;"And these say ""Tropical"" on..."
49:58;50:00;"So I guess there's a long history of Hershey's"
50:00;50:05;"changing their formula to send to the troops fighting in hot places."
50:05;50:08;"Wait, so, Daniel, have you tried the Hershey's Yingling?"
50:08;50:10;"No, I was saving it for..."
50:10;50:11;"Time crisis."
50:11;50:12;"Oh, you haven't taken a sip yet."
50:12;50:15;"Let's move on from the military chocolate industrial complex."
50:15;50:17;"Wait, wait, wait, I do want to say..."
50:17;50:18;"I want to say..."
50:18;50:19;"No, no, no, no."
50:19;50:21;"Just because you asked, just because you asked,"
50:21;50:23;"Kevin Paschall is his name,"
50:23;50:26;"and I only feel urgently that I should say,"
50:26;50:28;"because this was just an incredible email,"
50:28;50:30;"it was just one of those, like, thousand-word bangers"
50:30;50:33;"that gets into, like, this whole anthropological background."
50:33;50:36;"It's worth reading maybe at some point, but not today."
50:36;50:37;"Anyway."
50:37;50:38;"-No, go for it. -All right, shout-outs to Kevin."
50:38;50:40;"Is there anything we missed?"
50:40;50:42;"We're never gonna get to it later."
50:42;50:44;"This was a tough one."
50:44;50:48;"I mean, did you talk about Army quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan?"
50:48;50:50;"No, is this his idea?"
50:50;50:54;"Yeah, he asked Hershey to develop a bar that was four ounces,"
50:54;50:56;"able to withstand high temperatures,"
50:56;50:59;"high caloric value, and taste better than a boiled potato."
50:59;51:01;"Oh, my God, can't you already see, like,"
51:01;51:04;"the kind of late-period Disney movie of this,"
51:04;51:08;"where Tom Hanks plays, like, Mr. Hershey,"
51:08;51:11;"and John Hamm or something plays--"
51:11;51:13;"Wait, what's the quartermaster's name?"
51:13;51:16;"Quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan."
51:16;51:20;"John Hamm is quartermaster Colonel Paul Logan,"
51:20;51:24;"and he, like, gets off, like, the military plane in Hershey, PA,"
51:24;51:26;"and he comes in, and he's just like,"
51:26;51:28;"""Sir, do you love your country?"""
51:28;51:29;"And Tom Hanks is like,"
51:29;51:32;"""The only thing I love more than chocolate is my country, sir."""
51:32;51:36;"And he's like, ""We're in dire need of chocolate that won't melt."""
51:36;51:41;"It's kind of like a feel-good PG Disney historical film."
51:41;51:42;"I mean, what am I even thinking of?"
51:42;51:44;"I'm, like, taking this from something,"
51:44;51:46;"but it seems like when America was at war."
51:46;51:49;"Well, it's like every other Tom Hanks film."
51:49;51:50;"Right."
51:50;51:54;"You know, the story that's not told is that the World War II bar"
51:54;51:58;"was sarcastically nicknamed ""Hitler's secret weapon,"""
51:58;52:02;"because the oat flour and the chocolate--"
52:02;52:04;"Movie title."
52:04;52:06;"--made the bar so dense"
52:06;52:08;"that soldiers couldn't even bite into them,"
52:08;52:11;"and the lack of sugar also rendered the chocolate"
52:11;52:13;"almost too bitter to be edible,"
52:13;52:17;"and it caused constipation and made everybody feel awful."
52:17;52:18;"[laughter]"
52:18;52:20;"Oh, no, that's why Disney didn't make the movie,"
52:20;52:25;"is because the Hershey Company almost lost the war for the Allies."
52:25;52:26;"Yeah, that's not a movie."
52:26;52:28;"That's a good, like, eight-part podcast."
52:28;52:30;"Okay, it's either a podcast,"
52:30;52:33;"or maybe it's, like, an HBO miniseries,"
52:33;52:38;"like a Mildred Pierce HBO period miniseries."
52:38;52:40;"It all takes place in Hershey, PA."
52:40;52:42;"You know, and also, Daniel, back me up."
52:42;52:45;"A lot of German heritage in Pennsylvania, right?"
52:45;52:47;"Yeah, I grew up in what some people would describe"
52:47;52:49;"as, like, Amish country, kind of."
52:49;52:51;"There's a lot of Pennsylvania Dutch people"
52:51;52:52;"and Amish people around."
52:52;52:54;"Definitely a huge German influence on, like,"
52:54;52:56;"beer culture, food culture, and everything there."
52:56;53:00;"Right, hence the beer and all the good food."
53:00;53:02;"So you could also imagine that there's, like,"
53:02;53:05;"some weird sh-- about, like, there's a German immigrant guy,"
53:05;53:08;"and he just got a job at the Hershey factory,"
53:08;53:10;"but he has, like, this heavy German accent."
53:10;53:12;"He actually is, like, a good dude,"
53:12;53:14;"and he's just like, ""I want nothing more"
53:14;53:16;"than to serve America. America, I love you."""
53:16;53:18;"But then, like, everybody else is like,"
53:18;53:20;"""I don't know if we can trust you, man."""
53:20;53:23;"And then there really is actually a Nazi spy,"
53:23;53:25;"but it's, like, some other dude,"
53:25;53:27;"and you probably, like, learned some heartwarming lesson"
53:27;53:29;"about don't judge a book by its cover"
53:29;53:30;"or something like that,"
53:30;53:33;"and that guy actually was putting the constipation--"
53:33;53:35;"He was a double agent chocolatier."
53:35;53:37;"I mean, there probably was sh--."
53:37;53:39;"There was sabotage happening at American factories."
53:39;53:41;"Why wouldn't they have made it to Hershey, PA?"
53:41;53:44;"- And then a title card at the end that just says"
53:44;53:49;"""100 years later, a chocolate beer was developed"
53:49;53:51;"using the technology."""
53:51;53:52;"[laughter]"
53:52;53:56;"The technology is still being used today."
53:56;53:57;"- ♪ Colonel ♪"
53:57;54:00;"♪ Forbidden, stood up at the mountain ♪"
54:00;54:02;"♪ ♪"

54:20;54:21;"- Hershey is a crazy place,"
54:21;54:24;"but the town where the Yingling Brewery is,"
54:24;54:26;"which is called Pottsville, Pennsylvania,"
54:26;54:29;"is also a really crazy town."
54:29;54:30;"It's in the middle of nowhere."
54:30;54:32;"It's close to, like, Bloomsburg University,"
54:32;54:34;"which is where a lot of people at my high school"
54:34;54:35;"went to college."
54:35;54:38;"But in the '70s, Muhammad Ali trained there"
54:38;54:39;"at a place called Deer Lake,"
54:39;54:42;"right in the middle of a random town in Pennsylvania."
54:42;54:43;"- Wow. - Wow."
54:43;54:44;"- That sounds kind of familiar,"
54:44;54:46;"maybe in, like, a documentary I watched or something."
54:46;54:49;"- Right, the one where he fights George Foreman"
54:49;54:51;"in Zimbabwe, or Zaire."
54:51;54:52;"Which country is it?"
54:52;54:54;"""Rumble in the Jungle."""
54:54;54:55;"- Right."
54:55;54:57;"- And there's a bunch of Ali training"
54:57;54:58;"in rural Pennsylvania."
54:58;54:59;"That's--yeah."
54:59;55:01;"- Pennsylvania's a fascinating state."
55:01;55:02;"- It's the kind of place where you can, like,"
55:02;55:04;"still buy a house for $12,000."
55:04;55:07;"It's really, like, the middle of nowhere."
55:07;55:09;"And the Yingling factory is the biggest employer"
55:09;55:10;"in the town."
55:10;55:12;"Yingling is, like, the beer that everybody I knew"
55:12;55:14;"got drunk on for the first time."
55:14;55:16;"That's, like, the go-to Pennsylvania beer."
55:16;55:17;"- Right, I wanted to talk about that"
55:17;55:19;"because I grew up in New Jersey."
55:19;55:22;"New Jersey and Pennsylvania have a lot in common."
55:22;55:26;"And I think the first time I ever got sh*t-faced,"
55:26;55:28;"it might have been on Yingling."
55:28;55:29;"Well, not sh*t-faced."
55:29;55:31;"Maybe the first time I, like, drank a couple beers."
55:31;55:32;"I think it was Yingling."
55:32;55:34;"And so I always thought of Yingling as being, like,"
55:34;55:37;"a major beer, but I think--Jake, were you the one"
55:37;55:39;"saying they don't even sell it in California?"
55:39;55:40;"- I don't think they do."
55:40;55:42;"Daniel, can you verify?"
55:42;55:44;"- Yeah, they don't sell it in California."
55:44;55:45;"They sell it on the East Coast,"
55:45;55:47;"and they're very provincial about it."
55:47;55:49;"They keep it local."
55:49;55:52;"I did see that they signed a deal with, like,"
55:52;55:54;"I think a Coors distributor that they're gonna start"
55:54;55:56;"selling it in other places, but if you want to get"
55:56;55:58;"in California, you have to have somebody send it to you."
55:58;56:01;"- But, so, like, you're in high school in Pennsylvania,"
56:01;56:04;"and, like, people are not buying, like, Bud"
56:04;56:06;"or, like, Corona."
56:06;56:08;"Everyone's just, like, feeling a sense of local pride,"
56:08;56:10;"and it's just like, ""Yingling, dude."""
56:10;56:12;"- Yeah, there's a little town near where I grew up"
56:12;56:16;"called--the town name is called Leather Corner Post."
56:16;56:17;"- Wow."
56:17;56:18;"- And there's a bar there called"
56:18;56:19;"the Leather Corner Post Hotel that,"
56:19;56:21;"the last time I was there, maybe, like,"
56:21;56:22;"three or four years ago, they still had"
56:22;56:23;"Quarter Yinglings."
56:23;56:24;"- Wow."
56:24;56:26;"- So it's, like, a beer that's cheap on tap."
56:26;56:27;"- Quarter Yinglings?"
56:27;56:28;"- Yeah."
56:28;56:29;"- Wow."
56:29;56:30;"- All the time."
56:30;56:31;"- Yeah, it's the cheapest beer"
56:31;56:32;"'cause they're getting it locally,"
56:32;56:34;"and, yeah, it's definitely the go-to"
56:34;56:36;"more than Bud or anything else,"
56:36;56:37;"at least in Allentown."
56:37;56:38;"- I love that."
56:38;56:40;"I love that there's some local pride,"
56:40;56:42;"and, you know, they've avoided, like,"
56:42;56:43;"it all being swallowed into, like,"
56:43;56:44;"some sort of global culture."
56:44;56:46;"They're sort of like the kids there,"
56:46;56:48;"'cause kids are, like, averse to, like,"
56:48;56:50;"local stuff that, like--"
56:50;56:51;"- Yeah."
56:51;56:52;"- You know, it's, like, interesting that they're,"
56:52;56:53;"like, ""Oh, yeah, Yingling."""
56:53;56:54;"- It's good."
56:54;56:55;"I'd say it's, like, 10% better"
56:55;56:57;"than opening up a Budweiser."
56:57;56:58;"Like, it's a little bit better,"
56:58;57:00;"and then they make a black and tan"
57:00;57:01;"that's really good, too,"
57:01;57:02;"so that's why I'm sort of hopeful"
57:02;57:05;"that maybe the chocolate beer will be delicious."
57:05;57:06;"- Crack it open."
57:06;57:07;"- Yeah, let's crack it open."
57:07;57:08;"- Yeah, let's find out."
57:08;57:09;"- Is it cold?"
57:09;57:10;"- Oh, yeah."
57:10;57:11;"- It's a porter."
57:11;57:13;"- It is a chocolate porter"
57:13;57:15;"made in Pottsville, Pennsylvania."
57:15;57:17;"- So this is a real Pennsylvanian"
57:17;57:20;"about to taste 300 years of Pennsylvania history"
57:20;57:22;"live on the internet radio."
57:22;57:24;"[laughs]"
57:24;57:25;"He's drinking it, folks."
57:25;57:27;"- Bottoms up."
57:27;57:29;"- Oh, that's very rough."
57:29;57:31;"- Oh."
57:31;57:33;"- After all this buildup."
57:33;57:34;"- What? - No."
57:34;57:36;"- No, it actually doesn't have that bad--"
57:36;57:38;"it has a pretty good aftertaste,"
57:38;57:40;"but it tastes like you took a sip of a Budweiser"
57:40;57:43;"and then ate a Tootsie Roll immediately afterwards."
57:43;57:44;"[laughter]"
57:44;57:46;"- So is it, like, really sweet, then?"
57:46;57:47;"- It's not sweet."
57:47;57:48;"It just has sort of, like,"
57:48;57:52;"a treacly, chocolatey kind of flavor hanging around."
57:52;57:53;"- Right, but I gotta say--"
57:53;57:54;"- Tootsie Roll."
57:54;57:55;"- I'm going back in for taste number two."
57:55;57:56;"- Go back in."
57:56;57:57;"I feel like Tootsie Roll"
57:57;58:00;"is the worst form of chocolate imaginable."
58:00;58:02;"- I disagree."
58:02;58:03;"- Really?"
58:03;58:04;"- I disagree."
58:04;58:05;"Also, you know what's funny?"
58:05;58:06;"- I disagree."
58:06;58:07;"- I was about to say, like,"
58:07;58:09;"does Hershey's make Tootsie Roll?"
58:09;58:10;"I looked it up."
58:10;58:13;"No, Tootsie Roll is not a Hershey's product."
58:13;58:16;"It's manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries"
58:16;58:18;"based in Chicago, Illinois."
58:18;58:20;"- How great a name is Tootsie Roll Industries?"
58:20;58:22;"[laughter]"
58:22;58:23;"- T-R-I."
58:23;58:24;"- Daniel, is it getting any better"
58:24;58:26;"with subsequent tastes?"
58:26;58:27;"- Um, no."
58:27;58:29;"It's definitely not something I would drink"
58:29;58:30;"more than one of."
58:30;58:33;"I hate to report that it's not my favorite beer"
58:33;58:35;"of all time, but it's definitely not."
58:35;58:37;"I'm washing it down with a Peroni right now."
58:37;58:40;"- Damn, bad luck for PA."
58:40;58:42;"Now, given that our election"
58:42;58:45;"and potentially the future of this country"
58:45;58:46;"might come down to Pennsylvania,"
58:46;58:49;"we need to try to turn this into, like, a bright spot."
58:49;58:52;"- Well, I'm happy to hear that it's made it"
58:52;58:55;"onto the shelves of every Wegmans in Allentown already."
58:55;58:56;"It seems like they're pushing it pretty hard"
58:56;58:57;"in my local area."
58:57;58:59;"I wouldn't say this is exactly a winner,"
58:59;59:02;"but maybe there'll be, like, a Reese's Yingling"
59:02;59:05;"down the road that's, like, a 2.0 of this."
59:05;59:07;"But this is definitely not it."
59:07;59:08;"- Maybe the fact that Pennsylvania"
59:08;59:12;"is taking such a massive L with this,"
59:12;59:14;"the Hershey's Yingling,"
59:14;59:16;"then we gotta hope that in November,"
59:16;59:20;"PA will really come through for the country."
59:20;59:21;"- We've discussed on the show,"
59:21;59:23;"Jake is borderline ashamed"
59:23;59:27;"of how Connecticut punches below its weight."
59:27;59:28;"But I would say that, you know,"
59:28;59:30;"New Jersey's off derided,"
59:30;59:32;"but at least New Jersey has, like,"
59:32;59:34;"these famous cultural products,"
59:34;59:36;"and it's, like, you know, it's out there."
59:36;59:37;"I would say that Pennsylvania,"
59:37;59:40;"especially once you get outside of, like, Philly,"
59:40;59:41;"everybody knows Philly cheesesteaks"
59:41;59:42;"and the sports teams,"
59:42;59:45;"but I do think Pennsylvania's a very interesting state"
59:45;59:47;"that, like, people don't really, like, get."
59:47;59:48;"You know what I mean?"
59:48;59:49;"- I do, for sure."
59:49;59:51;"I actually thought what you said was right on."
59:51;59:54;"I kind of associated the area I grew up with"
59:54;59:56;"as being almost Jersey, too."
59:56;59:59;"I grew up 20 minutes from Phillipsburg, New Jersey."
59:59;01:00:02;"I went to punk shows in New Jersey basements"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"and backyards and stuff like that,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"almost as much as I did Pennsylvania,"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"so there was always that kind of cross-pollination for me."
01:00:08;01:00:10;"And, yeah, stuff like--"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"I mean, I want to be clear,"
01:00:11;01:00:12;"I love both Yingling and Hershey's,"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"but it's funny to me that beer and chocolate"
01:00:14;01:00:17;"are, like, the two iconic things for Pennsylvania."
01:00:17;01:00:20;"It is, like, rooted in, like, strange German culture."
01:00:20;01:00:23;"There's a lot of very, like, conservative people around."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"There's a famous phrase about Pennsylvania"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"that it's Philadelphia and Pittsburgh"
01:00:27;01:00:28;"with Alabama in between,"
01:00:28;01:00:31;"because the center of Pennsylvania"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"has a lot of, like, hate groups"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"and things that are really, really rough"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"and don't reflect well on the state,"
01:00:37;01:00:40;"so it is, like, a little bit of an identity-less state,"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"I think, sometimes."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"- Maybe because it's so big."
01:00:42;01:00:45;"I mean, I'm sure this has come up on the show before,"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"and I imagine you can relate to this,"
01:00:47;01:00:48;"and definitely, Jake,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"we may have even done one of these drives together"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"when we toured together in the Dirty Projectors days."
01:00:53;01:00:56;"When you drive from, like, say, New York City to Chicago,"
01:00:56;01:01:01;"there's something so buff about how wide Pennsylvania is."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"In your head, you're just like,"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"""All right, gonna rip through Jersey,"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"""Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and then Chicago."""
01:01:08;01:01:10;"And then there's just something about"
01:01:10;01:01:11;"when you hit Pennsylvania,"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"you realize that's, like, a solid six-hour drive."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"All the other states are, like, reasonably wide."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"Pennsylvania's just so girthy."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"Just a big, fat state."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"- That's our identity, the girthy state."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"- The girthy state."
01:01:25;01:01:29;"- I think you need to add a Hershey Park trip"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"into the middle of Pennsylvania from now on."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- Maybe that's the thing. - You can break it up."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- Yeah, just 'cause driving through Pennsylvania,"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"it just feels endless."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Whether or not it's true that it's Alabama in the center,"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"it's a lot of country in the center."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Isn't Pennsylvania where there's that, like,"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"old, like, coal-mining town that's on fire?"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"- Yes, Centralia."
01:01:47;01:01:48;"- Did you ever go there?"
01:01:48;01:01:49;"That's, like, a classic, like,"
01:01:49;01:01:50;"high school kid thing to do."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- I did, yeah."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"When I was, like, 21,"
01:01:53;01:01:54;"the girl I was dating at the time"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"made a documentary about it,"
01:01:56;01:01:57;"and I went up there, and..."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"- Oh. - Yeah, it's a 50--"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"you know, it's a town that's been on fire for 50 years."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"There's an underground coal mine burning underground"
01:02:04;01:02:06;"that they know they'll never be able to put out"
01:02:06;01:02:07;"until it burns out."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- It's a ghost town, essentially."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Yeah, when I was there,"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"there were about three houses left,"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"and one of them had a chimney"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"built up through the middle of it,"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"just, you know, expounding steam out from the ground."
01:02:17;01:02:18;"- Oh, my God."
01:02:18;01:02:20;"And you can just drive up there?"
01:02:20;01:02:21;"- Yeah."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- Oh, there's a guy still living there."
01:02:22;01:02:24;"- The highways are all cracked from the pressure,"
01:02:24;01:02:27;"and you can basically, like, drive on a highway"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"that just ends when it got so damaged"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"they couldn't use it anymore,"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"and they paid everybody to leave town."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"Another Pennsylvania town where you could probably"
01:02:34;01:02:37;"buy property for $10,000 or something."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"It's, like--yeah, it is, like--"
01:02:39;01:02:40;"it's basically a ghost town."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"- That might be nice in the winter."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"In a tough Pennsylvania winter, you go there,"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"it's probably kind of tropical."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"It's semi-tropical."
01:02:47;01:02:50;"- I hope we're not reaching the sleep-in-caves"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"portion of our society, but, yeah,"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"it might be a good spot."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"- So it's a thumbs-down on the Hershey's Yangling,"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"but that's just one man's opinion."
01:02:58;01:03:01;"Daniel, Jake and I will still go in"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"with totally open minds when we try it,"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"perhaps on the next show."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- Two weeks from now."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"- Should we break it up that maybe, Jake,"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"you try it on the next one,"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"and then the one after that, I try it,"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"then Nick and Seinfeld."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"We keep this going for months."
01:03:15;01:03:17;"- Let's practice it out."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"- Yeah, that seems great."
01:03:20;01:03:23;"- We should invite Tim Heidecker back on the show"
01:03:23;01:03:24;"to try on-- - Allentown man."
01:03:24;01:03:26;"- Yeah. - Another Allentown guy."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"- We actually went to rival high schools."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
01:03:29;01:03:32;"- What's your take on the Billy Joel song ""Allentown""?"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"- Well, I think--I know Jake knows,"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"and I don't know if the rest of you guys know,"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"but for the past couple years,"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"I've been working as a bartender out in Malibu."
01:03:38;01:03:42;"And people like to ask bartenders where they're from."
01:03:42;01:03:43;"And when I say Allentown,"
01:03:43;01:03:46;"I have had a conversation about Billy Joel"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"probably five days a week for, like, two years,"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"because it's the only thing people know about Allentown."
01:03:52;01:03:54;"- Does anybody ever not reference the Billy Joel song,"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"but you know that's the only thing they know?"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"They're just like--"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"- Oh, man, how's it been"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"since they shut all the factories down?"
01:04:00;01:04:01;"[laughter]"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Are your folks still living out in Allentown?"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- Yeah, on the Jersey Shore."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"[laughter]"
01:04:06;01:04:08;"- Well, working out in Malibu,"
01:04:08;01:04:10;"I bet you get some interesting customers"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"and probably occasionally some showbiz types."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Have you ever had somebody sit down and say, like,"
01:04:14;01:04:16;"""Oh, sh--, I'm Billy's lawyer."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Let's FaceTime him right now""?"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"- No, I've never had that happen."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"The closest--I don't work there anymore,"
01:04:22;01:04:24;"so I can kind of talk about this stuff now, but--"
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- Oh, nice."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- One night, Rod Stewart came in with his wife,"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"and he actually sort of became a regular."
01:04:29;01:04:30;"I got to know him a little bit."
01:04:30;01:04:31;"- Legend."
01:04:31;01:04:33;"- He once sang my name when he came into the bar,"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"which was pretty cool."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- Oh, sick."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"- And his wife was with him,"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"and she's a really sweet lady."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"I really enjoyed spending time with her,"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"and she--I was going to see the Rolling Stones"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"the next night, and I had made a drink special"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"called the Tumbling Dice,"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"and she took a picture of the sign that I had made for it,"
01:04:50;01:04:52;"and she was like, ""We're going up to Ronnie's"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"for dinner tonight. I'm gonna send him this"
01:04:54;01:04:56;"so I can show him the drink you made for the Rolling Stones."""
01:04:56;01:04:57;"- Oh, my God."
01:04:57;01:04:58;"- I was like, ""All right, that's pretty crazy."""
01:04:58;01:04:59;"- That's awesome."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- One of the things I liked about working there"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"is a lot of people who came wanted to talk about,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"like, the musical history of Malibu."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"They loved Neil Young, or they loved Bob Dylan."
01:05:08;01:05:10;"You know, Dylans lived there for the past,"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"like, I don't know, 25, 30 years."
01:05:12;01:05:15;"Yeah, it actually kind of took becoming a bartender"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"to figure out how to be, like, a better music writer"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"because I actually found out what people"
01:05:19;01:05:20;"really care about with music."
01:05:20;01:05:23;"Like, people really are into the history and the lore,"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"and Malibu is, like--"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"has a really fascinating history in general."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"- Would you get people who, like, came"
01:05:29;01:05:32;"from other parts of the U.S. or the world"
01:05:32;01:05:34;"just to come check out Malibu?"
01:05:34;01:05:35;"- Definitely."
01:05:35;01:05:38;"There's, like, a top-five country song right now"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"that mentions Malibu."
01:05:39;01:05:41;"There's, like, six rap songs that mention Malibu"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"that are popular right now."
01:05:43;01:05:45;"It's, like, become such a cultural thing"
01:05:45;01:05:48;"that, like, people do go there to stand in front of Nobu."
01:05:48;01:05:50;"They go there to experience a little bit"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"of, like, current music culture,"
01:05:52;01:05:55;"and then also the old-timers who would come in"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"would be like, ""Oh, that place across the street,"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"""Cafe Escobar, Neil Young used to own that place"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"back in the '70s."
01:06:00;01:06:01;"That was the crazy horse."""
01:06:01;01:06:03;"So it does have, like, a cool history."
01:06:03;01:06:05;"- Well, and you're working on a story"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"about Philip Kramer, right?"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"- Yeah."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"I just found a couple of really amazing producers"
01:06:11;01:06:12;"to work on this project with."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"I'm doing a story about this guy,"
01:06:14;01:06:18;"Philip Taylor Kramer, from the band Iron Butterfly,"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"and he disappeared in Malibu in 1995."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"- Ah."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"- He was also a rocket scientist"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"and an electrical engineer,"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"and a couple weeks before he disappeared,"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"he claimed that he invented teleportation."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"So it's a crazy story,"
01:06:32;01:06:36;"and I've been talking to all kinds of scientists"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"and his family,"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"and, yeah, I'm pretty excited about it."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"We're gonna have it out pretty soon."
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Oh, sick. That's amazing."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"- Yeah, it's a wild one, for sure."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- One random question,"
01:06:45;01:06:48;"and I imagine at a high-end bar in Malibu,"
01:06:48;01:06:50;"this might not have come up too often,"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"but are you familiar"
01:06:51;01:06:55;"with Jolly Rancher-based alcoholic drinks?"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"It's a thing, I believe."
01:06:57;01:06:58;"Maybe not at a nice bar,"
01:06:58;01:07:01;"but is it like a high school kid thing,"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"or vodka with Jolly Ranchers?"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"Did you know anything about this?"
01:07:06;01:07:08;"- The only thing I know that's called a Jolly Rancher"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"is it's often--"
01:07:09;01:07:12;"I also worked at kind of a more divey bar"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"in San Pedro for a while,"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"and if people were ordering a bunch of shots,"
01:07:16;01:07:18;"they would order a Jolly Rancher,"
01:07:18;01:07:23;"which would be vodka, lime, simple syrup,"
01:07:23;01:07:26;"and some sort of red curacao or something like that,"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"and then you'd shake it up super cold"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"and take it as a shot,"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"but I don't know specifically"
01:07:29;01:07:30;"like a Jolly Rancher cocktail."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"- In the course of bartending,"
01:07:31;01:07:35;"you've never had to melt down a pot of Jolly Ranchers?"
01:07:35;01:07:37;"- No, but the bar I worked in,"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"I had drinks that had like 16 ingredients in them,"
01:07:39;01:07:43;"and I would have to melt sugar into glass sculptures"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"to put across the top of glasses"
01:07:44;01:07:45;"and stuff like that, so--"
01:07:45;01:07:46;"- Oh, my God."
01:07:46;01:07:48;"- I am used to a little bit of that kind of stuff,"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"but the Jolly Rancher does not--"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"I don't know if there's a lot of"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Jolly Rancher-Malibu crossover."
01:07:53;01:07:55;"- You basically know how to make everything now?"
01:07:55;01:08:00;"- I do, yeah, and I'm a level one certified sommelier too"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"from that job, which is kind of cool."
01:08:01;01:08:03;"- Well, and we were all talking off mic."
01:08:03;01:08:05;"We were talking with Daniel about"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"pursuing the Sweet Chili Heat idea."
01:08:07;01:08:09;"- Yeah, dudes, I've got bottles sitting here"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"anytime you want to taste it."
01:08:11;01:08:12;"- All right, we got it."
01:08:12;01:08:15;"- We were cooking that idea up, and then COVID hit,"
01:08:15;01:08:18;"but we have a top-tier bartender here."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"- I do actually miss bartending a lot."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"I hope that I get to do it again someday."
01:08:21;01:08:24;"There's no bars open here now, unfortunately."
01:08:24;01:08:27;"- Right, I mean, the social aspect of it,"
01:08:27;01:08:30;"it's like, obviously, it's very meaningful"
01:08:30;01:08:33;"to a lot of people to just have a place to go."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"- Yeah, I always had Mondays and Tuesdays off"
01:08:35;01:08:37;"because of my work schedule, and I was always--"
01:08:37;01:08:40;"I went to a karaoke thing every Monday night"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"for like two years with one of my buddies."
01:08:42;01:08:44;"So, yeah, it's like, that's all gone."
01:08:44;01:08:46;"We've tried to do a Zoom karaoke thing,"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"and it's been depressing, so--"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"- Oh, God."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- This is about the kind of social interactions"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"I have for the most part is this kind of stuff."
01:08:53;01:08:55;"I don't head out that much."
01:08:55;01:08:56;"- Well, hopefully soon."
01:08:56;01:08:58;"- We'll be bringing back the bars."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- One quick question."
01:08:59;01:09:01;"When Rod Stewart would sing your name,"
01:09:01;01:09:03;"would he sing it in the--"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"would he sing the Elton John song?"
01:09:05;01:09:07;"- That's exactly what happened."
01:09:07;01:09:08;"He walked in one day and went--"
01:09:08;01:09:09;"- Oh, really?"
01:09:09;01:09:12;"♪ Daniel, my brother, you are older than me ♪"
01:09:12;01:09:16;"And then I remember the same day when he left,"
01:09:16;01:09:17;"he answered the lobby phone."
01:09:17;01:09:19;"He just picked it up and went,"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"""Malibu and Rod Stewart speaking,"""
01:09:21;01:09:22;"and then hung up the phone."
01:09:22;01:09:23;"[laughter]"
01:09:23;01:09:24;"- God."
01:09:24;01:09:25;"That rules."
01:09:25;01:09:26;"- Yeah."
01:09:26;01:09:27;"- All I can count was Rod Stewart."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"- Yeah, and actually, I was gonna tell you guys,"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"one of the other cool ones was,"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"I got to talk to Lior Cohen."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"He came into the--he's like musical--"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"he came into the bar one night at, like, 9 o'clock,"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"and he was the only person there for the last three hours,"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"and we just shot the sh--,"
01:09:42;01:09:43;"and he was telling me about"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"working with Willie Nelson and all this crazy stuff."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"It was like, those were the nights where I was--"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"I felt so lucky to have that job."
01:09:49;01:09:51;"- Yeah, that seems like best-case scenario"
01:09:51;01:09:54;"is just, like, you and one person"
01:09:54;01:09:57;"make a drink every, like, 30 minutes,"
01:09:57;01:09:59;"just talk. - Yeah."
01:09:59;01:10:00;"- Are there a lot of nights like that?"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"- Yeah, out there. There were."
01:10:02;01:10:05;"- Well, hopefully we'll all be having a drink"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"in the not-so-distant future,"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"pounding some sweet chili heat."
01:10:08;01:10:09;"- Oh, yeah."
01:10:09;01:10:11;"- Not a Hershey's."
01:10:11;01:10:12;"- Yeah."
01:10:12;01:10:13;"[laughter]"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"- Yeah, or a Dodger Stadium margarita."
01:10:16;01:10:17;"- Right."
01:10:17;01:10:18;"[laughter]"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"- You just had the worst yingling of your life."
01:10:20;01:10:23;"- I did just have the worst yingling of my life."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"- Oh!"
01:10:24;01:10:27;"Like, verse one is like, ""Let's be clear."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"I'm a Pennsylvanian through and through."
01:10:29;01:10:30;"I love my home state."""
01:10:30;01:10:32;"- I love my home bro. Yeah."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- And I love my home bro, but..."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- Yeah."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"[laughter]"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"- All right, well, thanks so much, dude."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"- Guys, thank you so much."
01:10:40;01:10:41;"- Appreciate having you on."
01:10:41;01:10:43;"- Yeah, you know I'm a big TC fan,"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"so thanks for having me on."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"- Oh, we'll definitely be having you back."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Broke the seal now."
01:10:47;01:10:48;"All right, have a good one, dude."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"- Talk to you guys later."
01:10:50;01:10:51;"- Bye."
01:10:51;01:10:52;"- Peace."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"- Bye."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"- Peace."

01:12:08;01:12:11;"That'll be in the next seven episodes."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"We'll be the unfolding saga"
01:12:13;01:12:15;"of the Hershey's Yingling Porter."
01:12:15;01:12:18;"All right, Seinfeld, we got a little social media report"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"coming from you."
01:12:19;01:12:23;"- Yeah, we received an email to our fan email address,"
01:12:23;01:12:25;"which is 8minutecapecod@gmail.com."
01:12:25;01:12:27;"That's the numeral, not the word, eight."
01:12:27;01:12:30;"8minutecapecod@gmail.com."
01:12:30;01:12:34;"From fan of the show, Camelia Munoz."
01:12:34;01:12:37;"- Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"- Hey, TC, I don't know if you've all been made aware"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"of it yet, but ""Campus"" by Vampire Weekend"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"has become a TikTok song"
01:12:46;01:12:49;"within a trend/challenge on the app."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"Basically, people play the song while showing clips"
01:12:52;01:12:55;"of their college campuses as follows."
01:12:55;01:12:58;"And then she's sent a link to an example"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"of what she's talking about."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"Also, this particular one,"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"where the girl taking the video"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"actually goes to Columbia."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"- And even before we got this email, Seinfeld,"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"you were maybe sharing some tweets or something."
01:13:11;01:13:12;"- It's one of those things"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"that I've received several DMs about."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"- And first question is, is there a Seinfeld 2000 TikTok?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"Do you have an account?"
01:13:19;01:13:21;"- There is, I think I have one thing on it."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"Just 'cause when TikTok, and we're talking about"
01:13:23;01:13:24;"like the start of this year,"
01:13:24;01:13:27;"when it started to become a thing,"
01:13:27;01:13:29;"you know, I typically what I'll do is"
01:13:29;01:13:31;"I'll just make sure that I have Seinfeld 2000"
01:13:31;01:13:34;"on any platform so someone else doesn't"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"try to, you know, be an imposter."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"And I did post one thing,"
01:13:39;01:13:41;"didn't really do that hot."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"Maybe I was too ahead of the game"
01:13:43;01:13:44;"and I was kind of turned off forever."
01:13:44;01:13:47;"I was like, this is not going immediately viral."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"And really, I don't have the energy"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"to maintain yet another account on another platform."
01:13:52;01:13:53;"So I just kind of let it sit."
01:13:53;01:13:54;"- Well, hold on a second."
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Sounds like you've been a little bit spoiled"
01:13:56;01:13:57;"by Twitter and Instagram."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"I mean, I remember when I first started"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"following you on Twitter,"
01:14:01;01:14:04;"man, you'd be lucky if you had 5,000 followers."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"You know, like you got to put in the work Seinfeld."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"- It's a lot of maintenance."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"It's a lot of upkeep."
01:14:10;01:14:12;"You know, I stopped posting on Facebook"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"for that reason, 'cause it's just like,"
01:14:14;01:14:15;"you know, it's okay."
01:14:15;01:14:16;"It's okay, guys."
01:14:16;01:14:19;"Just like, anyway, why are we talking about this?"
01:14:19;01:14:20;"Yeah, so I am on TikTok."
01:14:20;01:14:22;"- Have you watched some of these?"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"- Yeah, I've watched a few of them."
01:14:24;01:14:27;"- Generally speaking, is there like a joke or a dance,"
01:14:27;01:14:30;"or do people just like show around their campus?"
01:14:30;01:14:34;"- I would say there isn't really an explicit joke to it."
01:14:34;01:14:36;"I would say there's a structure to it"
01:14:36;01:14:39;"that I guess once replicated,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"starts to feel like a joke,"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"as these memes, you know, typically are."
01:14:43;01:14:48;"But it seems like once the refrain of the song starts,"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"people start to show their campus."
01:14:50;01:14:54;"And in the best ones, there's something a little,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"you know, a little unique to that."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- Weird happening?"
01:14:57;01:14:58;"- Weird happening."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"Yeah, I see one where there's a bear"
01:15:00;01:15:02;"roaming around on campus."
01:15:02;01:15:03;"- Uh-oh."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"- I think that's kind of all there is to it, really."
01:15:05;01:15:06;"- Well, it seems harmless."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"I mean, I made a joke on the thread"
01:15:08;01:15:09;"when you said this was going viral,"
01:15:09;01:15:13;"and I said, ""12 years of corrective PR down the drain."""
01:15:13;01:15:15;"Just because, obviously."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"I think it's a great song, and I love anything"
01:15:17;01:15:20;"that gets people back into the early stuff."
01:15:20;01:15:22;"The only thing, though, is that--"
01:15:22;01:15:24;"and I think within the song ""Campus,"""
01:15:24;01:15:27;"there's some complexity, because that originally started"
01:15:27;01:15:29;"with a demo Rostam made, and that's the--"
01:15:29;01:15:32;"I think that might be the only Vampire Weekend song"
01:15:32;01:15:36;"that lyrically didn't start with my words or ideas."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"So I added a few things here and there to the song,"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"and I think we came together to give it something."
01:15:41;01:15:43;"And the parts that I added, as I recall,"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"were like--I added the cruel professor part,"
01:15:45;01:15:49;"'cause I just wanted to make sure that it had a little bit of--"
01:15:49;01:15:50;"I don't know what to say."
01:15:50;01:15:53;"Not darkness, but just a little bit of uneasiness."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"And I wrote the line about the person"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"who spilled kefir on their keffiyeh,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"because that was an era which definitely"
01:15:59;01:16:02;"would not happen in 2020, but where a lot of"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"non-Palestinian, left-leaning activist types"
01:16:05;01:16:08;"would wear the traditional Palestinian scarf."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"I think sometimes it shows solidarity"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"with the Palestinian struggle,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"but it also very quickly became just like this"
01:16:14;01:16:17;"kind of fashion-y thing, and, you know,"
01:16:17;01:16:19;"kind of made me think of some of the"
01:16:19;01:16:22;"empty posturing that you occasionally encounter"
01:16:22;01:16:23;"on a college campus."
01:16:23;01:16:25;"So it was always important to me,"
01:16:25;01:16:27;"and I think to everybody in the band,"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"that because Vampire Weekend in the early days"
01:16:29;01:16:32;"came across so strongly with our"
01:16:32;01:16:35;"semi-satirical Ivy League preppy thing,"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"it was important that within the songs,"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"especially a song called ""Campus,"""
01:16:39;01:16:40;"that there were a few elements,"
01:16:40;01:16:42;"and I think the way everybody plays on it,"
01:16:42;01:16:45;"giving it this kind of more jagged punk feel"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"than the way Rustin originally had it"
01:16:47;01:16:48;"mocked up with strings,"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"I think all that stuff kind of combined"
01:16:50;01:16:54;"to fit a tone, you know, similar to like"
01:16:54;01:16:55;"the Oxford commas in these songs"
01:16:55;01:16:59;"that are a little bit about grappling with elitism."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"So anyway, that's all to say that,"
01:17:01;01:17:05;"because in the early days, people came so hard for us"
01:17:05;01:17:08;"as being like, ""Are you guys just some, like,"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"stuck-up rich kids, and your music"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"is literally just about showing off"
01:17:13;01:17:14;"that you went to an Ivy League school?"""
01:17:14;01:17:17;"I gotta say, when you first told me about the challenge,"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"you know, it triggered some old trauma,"
01:17:19;01:17:22;"where I'm just like, ""Ugh, is this literally"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"just people showing off their campuses?"""
01:17:24;01:17:27;"And look, I'm sure there's all sorts of different schools,"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"but I would just hope that within the trend,"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"there is a little bit of a..."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"If it's truly in the Vampire Weekend spirit,"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"you know, I hope there's a little bit of satire,"
01:17:36;01:17:39;"but at the same time, once you make music,"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"and you release a song, it's in the hands of the world now."
01:17:42;01:17:45;"Ezra, how did it strike you that, you know,"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"I feel like there are so many record labels,"
01:17:48;01:17:50;"music marketing people, artists,"
01:17:50;01:17:54;"trying to force their way into the mainstream"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"through the TikTok platform"
01:17:56;01:17:59;"as a means of generating the next Old Town Road,"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"or what have you, and you've just sort of, like,"
01:18:01;01:18:04;"organically had some old material"
01:18:04;01:18:07;"just sort of naturally become part of the fabric"
01:18:07;01:18:08;"of this platform."
01:18:08;01:18:10;"I think when we first talked about TikTok on the show,"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"I got a DM or two where somebody said"
01:18:12;01:18:16;"that Apunk once had a little moment on TikTok."
01:18:16;01:18:19;"But it was kind of before TikTok was quite so huge,"
01:18:19;01:18:22;"so it couldn't have made the same impact as Campus."
01:18:22;01:18:24;"But so, like, you know, I'd heard about it,"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"but look, outside of my own personal fears"
01:18:26;01:18:29;"about people misinterpreting our first album,"
01:18:29;01:18:31;"which I'll probably have for the rest of my life,"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"I will say that any time anything bubbles up"
01:18:35;01:18:38;"with old music, I love it, because it's like,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"there's only so much you can do in the moment"
01:18:40;01:18:43;"to, like, promote your new music, right?"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"Like, you know, we put out an album last year,"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"and of course we went on tour,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"made, you know, all the things that you do."
01:18:48;01:18:52;"But after that, your catalog, you know,"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"kind of just sits there, and every once in a while"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"you get a call like, oh, they want to use"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"a song from Contra in a commercial,"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"and you're like, oh, interesting."
01:19:00;01:19:03;"Or suddenly you'll get a nice note"
01:19:03;01:19:05;"from somebody who's just listened to, like,"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"Modern Vampires for the first time or something."
01:19:07;01:19:09;"But anyway, because as a musician,"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"you've got to be so focused on, like,"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"the present and what comes next,"
01:19:12;01:19:15;"it's always nice to get these little reminders"
01:19:15;01:19:18;"that everything your band has ever done"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"is still reaching new people."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"So in that sense, I love hearing stories like this."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"- Hey, I'm so sorry, I had to step out"
01:19:26;01:19:29;"for one second, so you might have mentioned this."
01:19:29;01:19:32;"In the article I'm reading, @goblininfluencer,"
01:19:32;01:19:36;"in her campus video, her caption says,"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"""Love your school, and it should be a place"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"where you're happy, but keep this in mind"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"because some of these vids are missing the point."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"#VampireWeekend."""
01:19:44;01:19:45;"- Ooh."
01:19:45;01:19:49;"- And in her TikTok, the text at the top says,"
01:19:49;01:19:52;"""This is a reminder that all of Vampire Weekend's music"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"is about feeling alienated from the elitist class"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"society culture while still wanting to be validated"
01:19:56;01:19:59;"by it,"" Ezra Koenig has mentioned that"
01:19:59;01:20:00;"all of the members went to Columbia"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"on scholarships and didn't fit with the traditional"
01:20:02;01:20:05;"WOS mold. Campus was literally written"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"by an Iranian-American gay guy about his experiences."
01:20:08;01:20:09;"So whether or not all that's true,"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"there are people who are reclaiming your feelings"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"of this is not just to celebrate one thing."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"So outside of the--"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"- Yeah, she didn't get all her facts straight."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"(laughs)"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"Not everybody went to Columbia,"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"but I like the spirit of it."
01:20:22;01:20:24;"Well, one thing I've always said is,"
01:20:24;01:20:25;"I might have been the only member of the band"
01:20:25;01:20:28;"who had any scholarship or student loans thing,"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"but everybody did come from different backgrounds"
01:20:31;01:20:32;"and I think didn't exactly--"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"I think the other part of it is true,"
01:20:34;01:20:37;"that not everybody fit the kind of WOS mold."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"And I think it's important to recognize the extent"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"to which many, many people do feel--"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"I would imagine a school like Columbia,"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"if you really said, ""What percentage of people here"
01:20:46;01:20:49;"feel like they 100% fit into the history"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"of these old Ivy League schools?"""
01:20:51;01:20:52;"It's a very low percentage."
01:20:52;01:20:54;"Most people feel alienated in some way."
01:20:54;01:21:00;"And I think that's why an album that on its face,"
01:21:00;01:21:03;"like our first album, seemed so--"
01:21:03;01:21:07;"was so easy to deride because--"
01:21:07;01:21:09;"and of course, obviously, things went well."
01:21:09;01:21:10;"People were into it when it came out,"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"but for a lot of people, they had questions."
01:21:12;01:21:14;"They were like, ""Is this just some rich kid (beep)?"""
01:21:14;01:21:15;"As I was saying before,"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"I'd like to think that the alienation part of it"
01:21:19;01:21:22;"and the questioning and the wondering how you fit in"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"and all those things, I would like to think"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"that part of the reason that album has an enduring appeal"
01:21:27;01:21:30;"to this day is because most people,"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"whether they went to an Ivy League school,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"even if they didn't go to college,"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"those feelings are something that almost"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"every human being experiences--"
01:21:38;01:21:41;"those feelings of questioning, belonging, alienation."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"And I'd like to think that that's why our audience"
01:21:44;01:21:48;"is not just like New York rich kids or Ivy League people,"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"which would be very distressing if it was."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"So yeah, anyway, shout out to Goblin Influencer."
01:21:53;01:21:57;"I like the spirit of what you're saying."
01:21:57;01:21:59;"Yeah, I mean, it's--"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"whenever people point back to anything on the first album,"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"I think we've done enough with albums two through four"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"that we're definitely not in a position"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"where we'll always live in the shadow of that record."
01:22:09;01:22:11;"Like, I'm not going to name names,"
01:22:11;01:22:14;"but some people, it's very hard to beat your first record."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Famously, right?"
01:22:15;01:22:17;"But I think we've done enough that we've had"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"these distinct eras since then,"
01:22:20;01:22:23;"that the fact that people still find something"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"to get into or share with music"
01:22:26;01:22:29;"that a lot of which was written when we were students,"
01:22:29;01:22:33;"a lot of which was made before we had any idea"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"that we could, like, ever play a venue"
01:22:35;01:22:37;"bigger than, like, the Mercury Lounge."
01:22:37;01:22:40;"I love that, when people kind of get back into it."
01:22:40;01:22:43;"♪ I wake up, my shoulders cold ♪"
01:22:43;01:22:46;"♪ I've got to leave here before I go ♪"

01:23:16;01:23:18;"Anyway, shout out to TikTok,"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"and I hope the next time that there's a TC-related song"
01:23:21;01:23:24;"that goes viral, as discussed on the show,"
01:23:24;01:23:27;"it should be ""Mountain Brews,"" because that one writes itself."
01:23:27;01:23:30;"You and your friends, Sunday morning, you go for a hike,"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"and then, you know, whatever, like, you guys get in the car"
01:23:33;01:23:35;"or whatever, then you start hiking,"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"and then right when the chorus hits,"
01:23:37;01:23:39;"it's you guys cracking a brew on the top of the mountain"
01:23:39;01:23:41;"with a beautiful vista behind you."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"Can I actually jump in here and make a call to action?"
01:23:44;01:23:47;"-Yeah. -If anybody does make that TikTok,"
01:23:47;01:23:49;"tweet it at us @TimeCrisis2000."
01:23:49;01:23:51;"We will automatically retweet."
01:23:51;01:23:54;"Let's get this trending, guys. Let's make this a real thing."
01:23:54;01:23:58;"Let's bring Jake Longstreth to his natural habitat, TikTok."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"So far, there's six ""Mountain Brews"" TikToks."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"They're all for ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:24:03;01:24:05;"-They're all for the song ""Sweet Chili Heat""? -Yeah."
01:24:05;01:24:08;"I think that, yeah, the TC--"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"The only TikTok challenge should be to make--"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"Yeah, wait, what's some of them?"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"What's happening in the ""Sweet Chili Heat"" ones?"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"Honestly, it's just somebody shooting videos"
01:24:17;01:24:19;"of their ""Vampire Weekend"" posters,"
01:24:19;01:24:21;"some Bernie/Larry David merchandise."
01:24:21;01:24:24;"They got their dog in it. It's unfocused."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"-Here's another one. -That's cool."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"It's cool. I mean, no, it's got a vibe."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"This is the TC challenge."
01:24:30;01:24:32;"You throw on ""Sweet Chili Heat"""
01:24:32;01:24:34;"and shoot your ""Vampire Weekend"" and Bernie posters."
01:24:34;01:24:37;"And then this guy is doing Kyle's--"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"his mouthing first one of the evening."
01:24:39;01:24:42;"And then he's taking a shot"
01:24:42;01:24:45;"of sort of a hot sauce"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"as ""Sweet Chili Heat"" comes on."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"And it seems hot for him."
01:24:49;01:24:51;"It's a red-hot wing sauce. I mean, that's interesting."
01:24:51;01:24:53;"Damn."
01:24:53;01:24:55;"See, the song ""Mountain Brews"" requires people"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"to actually hike up a hill."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"-Right. -This one shot a little--"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Yeah, this one shot a little more sort of artsy."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"It has a filter on it. It's in black and white"
01:25:03;01:25:06;"and says, ""When that quarantine panic attack hits."""
01:25:06;01:25:08;"And you're on him for a minute."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"And then it just says, ""First one of the evening."""
01:25:10;01:25:12;"And the music comes on. You know, the guitar comes in."
01:25:12;01:25:15;"And you just sort of slowly pan into his face."
01:25:15;01:25:17;"It's just more vibey."
01:25:17;01:25:20;"And then another one is just an artist's rendition"
01:25:20;01:25:24;"of Jake standing in front of one of his paintings."
01:25:24;01:25:27;"You see him standing in front of it, hanging a painting."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"And then the Pizza Hut comes in."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"It sort of is-- You know what it is? It's a collage."
01:25:31;01:25:33;"It's a collage of your paintings."
01:25:33;01:25:36;"That guy made, like, a Mountain Brews cover."
01:25:36;01:25:38;"I know who you're talking about."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"He posted that on Instagram and tagged me."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"-Oh, yeah. That was really good. -He collaged an image of me"
01:25:43;01:25:46;"painting with the Pizza Hut and some tree paintings."
01:25:46;01:25:49;"And he was like, ""This is, like, the Mountain Brews vinyl cover."""
01:25:49;01:25:53;"So that is just sort of an animated version of that"
01:25:53;01:25:55;"to the beginning of ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:25:55;01:25:58;"-So that challenge hasn't taken a while. -Also, ""Sweet Chili Heat."""
01:25:58;01:26:00;"You know what? I've got a good one"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"for when ""Worst Margarita in My Life"" comes out."
01:26:02;01:26:05;"Because I've noticed this trend--"
01:26:05;01:26:07;"I see a lot of them on Instagram."
01:26:07;01:26:10;"I mean, I kind of hate it. I don't want to encourage it."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"But it's out there. There's this trend of, like,"
01:26:12;01:26:15;"couples pulling pranks on each other on TikTok."
01:26:15;01:26:17;"I guess couples pranking each other--"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Seinfeld, you're our social media expert."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"Back me up. This has been going on for years,"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"is couples pranking each other on the Internet."
01:26:24;01:26:27;"Yeah, and I think there's a degree of, like,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"stagedness to some of them."
01:26:29;01:26:31;"That's the thing that I hate, is that it's like"
01:26:31;01:26:34;"we're approaching, as we've discussed on this show many times,"
01:26:34;01:26:37;"just that we live in this weird spectacle."
01:26:37;01:26:41;"So there's these couples, and all they do is make TikToks"
01:26:41;01:26:43;"where they do the newest prank, which is like,"
01:26:43;01:26:45;"""Oh, somebody gets out of the car."
01:26:45;01:26:47;"""Your girlfriend gets in the car,"
01:26:47;01:26:51;"""and you say something like, 'Babe, you don't look good today.'"""
01:26:51;01:26:53;"And she's like, ""Why would you say that?"""
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Or it's like, you get out of the car,"
01:26:55;01:26:58;"you're like, ""Hold on. I've got to finish this phone call."""
01:26:58;01:27:00;"""Yeah, I love her so much."""
01:27:00;01:27:01;"Like, whatever."
01:27:01;01:27:04;"It's these jokes about the relationship,"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"or sometimes they're like sweet pranks,"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"like where you say something really nice,"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"and they're not supposed to hear it or something."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"But the thing that's so annoying about them"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"is that it's like a lot of times there's couples"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"that just do these every single day,"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"and they probably don't stage it, is the funny thing."
01:27:19;01:27:21;"Like, they're staged, of course,"
01:27:21;01:27:23;"but it's probably not even like, ""Hey, should we do this?"
01:27:23;01:27:25;"""Oh, yeah, yeah, let's go out to the car,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"""and I'm going to do this, and you're going to do that."""
01:27:27;01:27:29;"It's probably more just that the fabric of their lives"
01:27:29;01:27:32;"is so TikTok-oriented that they just kind of roll with it."
01:27:32;01:27:34;"It's like every time you get in the car,"
01:27:34;01:27:36;"your boyfriend says some dumb sh*t with you,"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"and as you respond to it,"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"you basically already know it's a TikTok."
01:27:40;01:27:43;"If anything, it's probably harder,"
01:27:43;01:27:45;"rather than having to performatively"
01:27:45;01:27:47;"do the TikTok challenge,"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"you probably have to sometimes get out of that gear."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"So probably you get into the car, and he's like,"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"""Where do you want to eat today, babe?"""
01:27:53;01:27:56;"And you're just like, ""Uh, I don't know."""

01:27:58;01:28:00;"""I don't know."""
01:28:00;01:28:02;"And then he's kind of like, ""No, no, I'm serious."""
01:28:02;01:28:04;"And you're like, ""Oh, it's not a TikTok challenge?"""
01:28:04;01:28:07;"Like, probably you just live in a permanent TikTok challenge."
01:28:07;01:28:10;"But anyway, even though I think that's kind of a disturbing"
01:28:10;01:28:12;"new element to our society,"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"you know, you can't fight progress,"
01:28:14;01:28:16;"I think one could be, for a couple--"
01:28:16;01:28:18;"and this is actually a real prank, by the way."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"It's not one of these dumb, like, get in the car"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"and say some weird sh*t."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"So this one is, your partner comes home"
01:28:24;01:28:26;"from a long day of work, and you say,"

01:28:32;01:28:34;"and I think I know how to make the best margarita on earth."""

01:28:38;01:28:40;"You bring it out to them, and then they sip it,"
01:28:40;01:28:42;"and then you gotta see how they react."
01:28:42;01:28:44;"Are they gonna spit it out and be like, ""This is disgusting."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"This tastes like flat Mountain Dew"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"mixed with tequila for a noxious brew."""
01:28:48;01:28:50;"Or are they gonna, you know, try to be nice"

01:28:52;01:28:54;"Anyway, then you got ""Worst Margarita in My Life"""

01:28:58;01:29:00;"I really encourage people to do that one."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"Alright, should we get into the top five?"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"It's time for the top five"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"f-f-f-f-f-five"

01:29:16;01:29:18;"of 2008."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Why 2008?"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"Is that when ""Campus"" came out?"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"Yeah, 2008 is the official release of ""Campus"""
01:29:24;01:29:26;"'cause our first album came out January 2008."

01:29:28;01:29:30;"they were floating around"

01:29:36;01:29:38;"I feel like this is a year I remember well."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"And the number five song"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"is a song I remember well."
01:29:42;01:29:44;"M.I.A., ""Paper Planes."""
01:29:44;01:29:46;"Well, she had the top five hit."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"I'm kind of surprised."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"I mean, this is a big hit."
01:29:50;01:29:52;"It made it to number five."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"It's big."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"I thought of her as more of a B-org"

01:29:58;01:30:00;"I think this was in the ""Pineapple Express"" trailer."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"That took it to another level."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Yeah."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"But you know what I mean?"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"I thought of her as elite indie"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"but not actually having any mainstream."
01:30:10;01:30:12;"This was her big song."
01:30:12;01:30:14;"She's on the new Travis Scott single, ""Franchise."""

01:31:00;01:31:02;"Yeah."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"Weren't we going to do the Vampire Weekend meal?"
01:31:04;01:31:06;"Oh, the Vampire Weekend meal at McDonald's?"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"Did we ever come up with it?"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"Or it was the Mountain Brew."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"I know Jake had a great Mountain Brew."
01:31:12;01:31:14;"That kind of went off on Twitter,"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"but that was great."
01:31:16;01:31:18;"Any burger you want with fries, no drink,"

01:31:20;01:31:22;"In the car, right? Six pack."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"The key is the no drink."

01:31:26;01:31:28;"That's right."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Sir, you'd actually be"

01:31:38;01:31:40;"you're going to actually pay a little more."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"I don't care."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"You said it was a watery beer or a light beer?"
01:31:44;01:31:46;"I said it was a watery domestic, which is"
01:31:46;01:31:48;"a low-key pavement reference."

01:31:58;01:32:00;"I've been on Twitter."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"Somebody made a poster."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"Somebody made the Cactus Jake"

01:32:10;01:32:12;"I mean, definitely not going to be able to top that."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"This is perfect."

01:32:26;01:32:28;"Anyone you want. Well, I want you to make"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"the decision for me. Can't."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"If you get a really annoying"

01:32:36;01:32:38;"all McDonald's employees nationwide"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"will have Jake's cell phone."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"Give him a quick buzz."
01:32:42;01:32:44;"""All right, Jake. Just pick a burger."""
01:32:44;01:32:46;"The Time Crisis meal"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"would definitely be an off-season McRib."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"You roll up when they don't have the McRib."
01:32:52;01:32:54;"But if you order the Time Crisis meal,"
01:32:54;01:32:56;"they're legally obligated to go"
01:32:56;01:32:58;"defrost a McRib for you."
01:32:58;01:33:00;"Even when it's not the season."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"Here's my idea for the Vampire Weekend meal."
01:33:02;01:33:04;"It's the Travis Scott meal"
01:33:04;01:33:06;"because, obviously, I want to piggyback off"
01:33:06;01:33:08;"of what he's doing."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Where he sits as a musician"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"and all these things he's"
01:33:12;01:33:14;"bringing together, I legitimately do"
01:33:14;01:33:16;"find fascinating. I don't want to"
01:33:16;01:33:18;"start from scratch. We need to be tied to"
01:33:18;01:33:20;"his heat."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"It's the Travis Scott meal, except instead"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"of barbecue sauce for the fries, you get ketchup."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"On the quarter pounder,"
01:33:26;01:33:28;"there's no bacon."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"[laughter]"
01:33:30;01:33:32;"The beverage instead of being a Sprite is a Coke."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"[laughter]"
01:33:34;01:33:36;"So that's it."
01:33:36;01:33:38;"It's the quarter pounder meal."
01:33:38;01:33:40;"You freak Brandon."
01:33:40;01:33:42;"And the soda is up to you."
01:33:42;01:33:44;"Yeah, and the soda's"
01:33:44;01:33:46;"up to you. We recommend Coke,"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"but if you want to get Sprite,"
01:33:48;01:33:50;"Diet Coke, that's all fine."
01:33:50;01:33:52;"I was thinking about this more because"
01:33:52;01:33:54;"we were called Travis Scott. He was like"
01:33:54;01:33:56;"the inverted negative spectacle."
01:33:56;01:33:58;"Poor, hazy, and whatever."
01:33:58;01:34:00;"It made me think, have we ever talked"
01:34:00;01:34:02;"about this on Time Crisis? Because I always think"
01:34:02;01:34:04;"about this."
01:34:04;01:34:06;"It always comes up. I feel like we were just talking about it in the studio"
01:34:06;01:34:08;"the other day. I guess it was a meme."
01:34:08;01:34:10;"Whatever. It was something being"
01:34:10;01:34:12;"passed around on the internet where somebody"
01:34:12;01:34:14;"wrote, I don't know if they're a gamer or"
01:34:14;01:34:16;"what, but they wrote a thing about Waluigi."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"It's kind of like an internet classic"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"because they really broke it down in this deeply philosophical"
01:34:20;01:34:22;"way where they're basically"
01:34:22;01:34:24;"saying how there's Mario and"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Luigi, right? Mario's the hero"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"and Luigi is kind of his random"
01:34:28;01:34:30;"ass sidekick. He represents"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"this kind of complimentary"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"nobody, but who"
01:34:34;01:34:36;"exists to provide"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"a context for Mario."
01:34:38;01:34:40;"Then you have Wario"
01:34:40;01:34:42;"who's the evil Mario, the"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"inverted Mario. We can understand"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"that. What's the opposite of a hero? It's a villain."
01:34:46;01:34:48;"Then there's also this"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"character called Waluigi"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"who's, as"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"Wario is to Mario, Waluigi is to"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"Luigi. Somebody wrote this"
01:34:56;01:34:58;"thing. I always used to see it getting passed around that"
01:34:58;01:35:00;"was this kind of brilliant take that"
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Luigi already is this nobody"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"man, so Waluigi"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"truly represents inverted negative"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"space. He's like the opposite of"
01:35:08;01:35:10;"nothing. He's like the double nothing"
01:35:10;01:35:12;"man. They made a joke about how"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"he doesn't even get an"
01:35:14;01:35:16;"elegant name like Wario. They just stick the"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"""Wa"" on top of the ""Luigi."" Later"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"people said that in Japanese,"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"Waluigi actually is kind of witty or something."
01:35:22;01:35:24;"I don't know."
01:35:24;01:35:26;"Anyway, this idea of"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"in this meme or whatever, it was"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"a kind of brilliant philosophical"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"treatise about"
01:35:32;01:35:34;"how Waluigi is"
01:35:34;01:35:36;"the opposite of nothing."
01:35:36;01:35:38;"It struck a chord with people."
01:35:38;01:35:40;"It's inverted negative space, whatever you want to call it."
01:35:40;01:35:42;"It's like that deep chasm."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"I think a lot of us feel like"
01:35:44;01:35:46;"Waluigi sometimes. We already"
01:35:46;01:35:48;"feel like we're not the main character."
01:35:48;01:35:50;"Sometimes we even feel like the opposite"
01:35:50;01:35:52;"of the guy who's not the main character."
01:35:52;01:35:54;"You know what I mean?"
01:35:54;01:35:56;"It's like a black hole of identity."
01:35:56;01:35:58;"I kind of like the idea that the"
01:35:58;01:36:00;"Vampire Weekend Meal is like"
01:36:00;01:36:02;"the Waluigi to the Travis Scott's Mario."
01:36:02;01:36:04;"Vampire Weekend had a taco"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"once to raise money"
01:36:06;01:36:08;"for the homeless at Home State Tacos"
01:36:08;01:36:10;"in LA."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"It was a great taco."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"They're really nice people who run"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"Home State. Shout out to them."
01:36:16;01:36:18;"They do a kind of a program where"
01:36:18;01:36:20;"I don't know if it's a monthly thing or what, but they always"
01:36:20;01:36:22;"team up with artists and they"
01:36:22;01:36:24;"design a taco. You have to sign off"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"on it though. Somehow it came up recently"
01:36:26;01:36:28;"and somebody was asking me, ""Do you really R&D that taco?"""
01:36:28;01:36:30;"I was like, ""Nah."""
01:36:30;01:36:32;"I think we might have said, ""Let's make it vegetarian"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"or vegan, even though"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I'm not vegan."" I was just kind of like, ""We're going to throw our name"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"on something. Maybe get"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"a good vegan taco out there."""
01:36:40;01:36:42;"Then they came up with it and it tasted great."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"It's a program they do to"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"raise money for"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"an organization that helps the homeless in LA."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"That's the only time we've done a"
01:36:50;01:36:52;"food thing like that. I would like"
01:36:52;01:36:54;"to do more. I always felt"
01:36:54;01:36:56;"more passionately about Taco Bell than McDonald's."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"Maybe Taco Bell would be down for"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"a Vampire Weekend meal."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Maybe you've got to start feeling it out."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"If there's any people"
01:37:04;01:37:06;"who work in the fast food industry,"
01:37:06;01:37:08;"especially on the marketing PR side,"
01:37:08;01:37:10;"and you're"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"looking to compete with Travis Scott,"
01:37:12;01:37:14;"we could really"
01:37:14;01:37:16;"make something special because"
01:37:16;01:37:18;"not only does Vampire Weekend have four albums"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"in stores now, we could use the musical side."
01:37:20;01:37:22;"If we really call"
01:37:22;01:37:24;"in the power of time crisis,"
01:37:24;01:37:26;"we could be talking about this for months."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Anyway, that was M.I.A. with Paper Planes."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Great song. Moving on."
01:37:30;01:37:34;"The number five song right now is"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"24K Golden - Mood, featuring"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Ian Dior."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"Wait, I feel like we heard this"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"before. Oh yeah, guitar."
01:37:42;01:37:44;"Who's the artist?"
01:37:44;01:37:46;"24K Golden."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"His real name is Golden Landis"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"Von Jones from"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"SF."
01:38:14;01:38:16;"Are you saying I'm not your dad?"
01:38:16;01:38:18;"I can never get"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"attached when I start to feel unattached."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"Somehow"
01:38:22;01:38:24;"always end up feeling bad."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"Baby, I am not your dad. No."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"It's not all you want from me."
01:38:28;01:38:30;"I just want your company."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"Girl, it's obvious elephant in the room."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"What does that part mean? I'm not your dad."
01:38:34;01:38:36;"I guess just"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"I'm not your dad. I'm not trying to"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"control you. I'm not trying to give you a set of"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"rules. Somebody chime"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"in here. Is she saying"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"that your dad's"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"too attached to you?"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"No, no, no. He's just like"
01:38:50;01:38:52;"I'm not here to order you around."
01:38:52;01:38:54;"I'm not here to constrict you"
01:38:54;01:38:56;"in your lifestyle. We're supposed to be boyfriend"
01:38:56;01:38:58;"and girlfriend and you're"
01:38:58;01:39:00;"assuming I have this"
01:39:00;01:39:02;"patriarchal relationship with you."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"I didn't impregnate"
01:39:04;01:39:06;"your mother and give birth to you."
01:39:10;01:39:12;"Maybe there's also an age"
01:39:12;01:39:14;"gap. Maybe he's like"
01:39:14;01:39:16;"in his mid late 30s"
01:39:16;01:39:18;"and he's dating someone that's"
01:39:18;01:39:20;"22."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"He's 60. She's"
01:39:22;01:39:24;"22. In his narrative"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"this 18 year old singer"
01:39:26;01:39:28;"is in his mid 30s."
01:39:28;01:39:32;"I like that."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"He's friendly with the dad."
01:39:34;01:39:36;"He bears an uncanny resemblance to the dad"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"that are often getting mixed up."
01:39:38;01:39:40;"It's funny too because the hook is"
01:39:40;01:39:42;"why you always in a mood."
01:39:42;01:39:44;"That actually sounds like something that a parent might say."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"You're in a mood today."
01:39:46;01:39:48;"Oh don't mind"
01:39:48;01:39:50;"them. They're just going through."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"This is how they are now. Okay."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"I say that to our dog."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"Why you always in a mood?"
01:39:56;01:39:58;"I'm always like God you're in a mood today."
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Aren't you in a mood?"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"This guy's acting an awful lot like her dad."
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Maybe he's just saying I know I'm acting"
01:40:04;01:40:06;"like your dad. I just want to clarify I'm not your dad."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"I like my theory that"
01:40:08;01:40:10;"he's like doing like a Springsteen thing."
01:40:10;01:40:12;"He's assuming a character."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"Right. But I'm not your dad."
01:40:14;01:40:16;"I might look like your dad but I'm not your dad."
01:40:16;01:40:18;"The number four song in 2008"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"Rihanna Disturbia."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"Was this related to that movie?"
01:40:22;01:40:24;"I've always wondered that."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"It must be like inspired by it."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"Yeah I think they came out"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"around the same time."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"What year is that movie?"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"I've gone crazy now."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"Disturbia"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"was 2007."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Early Shia."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"So Chris Brown wrote this song."
01:40:42;01:40:44;"Is this when they were"
01:40:44;01:40:46;"a couple? Is this one of Rihanna's"
01:40:46;01:40:48;"first big hits?"
01:40:48;01:40:50;"Well Umbrella was before this. That was her first"
01:40:50;01:40:52;"massive hit."
01:40:52;01:40:54;"This is when she was becoming one of the biggest artists"
01:40:54;01:40:56;"in the world."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"I don't think she really crossed my desk until like 2010."
01:40:58;01:41:00;"You don't remember"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"when Umbrella dropped?"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"Impossible."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"I probably heard the song but I don't think I"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"I don't think she as a pop star"
01:41:08;01:41:10;"like entered my consciousness"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"until the song that was"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"the one about"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"falling in love in an office space."
01:41:16;01:41:18;"We fell in love"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"in an office space."
01:41:20;01:41:22;"Jake."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"I guess this is"
01:41:26;01:41:28;"like a thriller type song."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"Using kind of like horror imagery."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"I'm just curious how they used the word"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"Disturbia."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"Inspired by the word Disturbia."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"When also Disturbia"
01:41:38;01:41:40;"is by the way a portmanteau"
01:41:40;01:41:42;"of disturbing and"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"suburbia."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"So like in any way is the song"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"related to like the concept of like"
01:41:48;01:41:50;"the dark side of suburbia."
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Your mind is in Disturbia."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"It's like the darkness is the light."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"Disturbia. Am I scaring you tonight?"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"Your mind is in Disturbia. Ain't used to"
01:41:58;01:42:00;"what you like. Disturbia. Disturbia."
01:42:00;01:42:02;"I think they're just using the word"
01:42:02;01:42:04;"as a way to say like"
01:42:04;01:42:06;"psychosis or"
01:42:06;01:42:08;"dementia. I don't think they're"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"stuck to the Shia LaBeouf"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"definition at all."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"It's a thief in the night to come and grab."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"Yeah it's just like a kind of a spooky song."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"The number four song right now"
01:42:18;01:42:20;"Drake. Laugh Now Cry Later"
01:42:20;01:42:22;"featuring Lil' Jerk."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"Since the first time this was on the show"
01:42:24;01:42:26;"I actually watched the video."
01:42:26;01:42:28;"That's him just horsing around at the Nike headquarters"
01:42:28;01:42:30;"in Beaverton, Oregon."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"It's a good video. It's fun."
01:42:32;01:42:36;"And there's a lot of him"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"just looking at the camera going"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"""Baby."""
01:42:58;01:43:00;"This is a good song. I recommend"
01:43:00;01:43:02;"the video. I watched it and it like"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"now I find this song much"
01:43:04;01:43:06;"more charming. Like the very"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"simple hook of just like saying ""Baby"" like"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"three times in the last song going"
01:43:10;01:43:12;"""Baby."" When you see it in the video"
01:43:12;01:43:14;"it really kind of comes together."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"I just want to go full circle."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Disturbia was recorded in Denver, Colorado"
01:43:18;01:43:20;"in April 2008."
01:43:20;01:43:22;"Really? I wonder why Denver?"
01:43:22;01:43:24;"I wonder if they're on tour."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"And also the first song we listened to, that guy's"
01:43:26;01:43:28;"first name was Golden."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"This is getting spooky. Like Golden, Colorado."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"The number two song."
01:43:32;01:43:34;"Sorry I just wanted to..."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"It's not about a specific personal experience"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"but rather the general feelings of mental"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"anguish, anxiety, and confusion."
01:43:40;01:43:42;"Yeah, Disturbia."
01:43:42;01:43:44;"No references to the film."
01:43:44;01:43:46;"Right. Anyway."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Another kind of spooky song in 2008."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"I guess 2008 was still kind of a spooky year."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"Because that"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"M.I.A. Paper Planes"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"we didn't really talk about it but it's got that"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"Clash Strait to Hell sample which is kind of"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"like sad and weird and eerie."
01:44:00;01:44:02;"Disturbia, spooky."
01:44:02;01:44:04;"And then this song was very spooky."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"Kanye West, Love Lockdown"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"of the seminal album"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"808s and Heartbreak."
01:44:12;01:44:14;"I remember when this"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"came out just being like, this is"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"cool. Did these songs come out"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"post your"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"recession, market crash?"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"I don't think so because I think the market"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"crash turns like the... well"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"when did the market crash? Right around now."
01:44:28;01:44:30;"That was late September. I want to say late"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"September. So these songs were"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"probably all pretty new."
01:44:36;01:44:52;"This song always made me think of"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"the theme from"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"the X-Men cartoon."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Lehman Brothers went bankrupt September"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"15th, 2008."
01:45:00;01:45:02;"Whoa, and this song came out three days later."
01:45:02;01:45:04;"That was weird"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"at the time. I was like, what's happening?"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Well and especially"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"because his first three"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"albums were just like hip hop with like"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"soul samples and rapping"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"and this song was just kind of different"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"vocally, beat wise."
01:45:18;01:45:20;"I was talking about the"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"financial crisis."
01:45:22;01:45:24;"What were you saying about the financial crisis?"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"I was just saying like at the time"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"I was just reflecting on it. I was just"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"like at the time I was sort of like, what the hell"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"is happening? Oh, I thought you just meant"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"as a Kanye fan when Love Lockdown dropped."
01:45:34;01:45:36;"We hadn't seen the big short yet."
01:45:36;01:45:38;"They were throwing around terms like we were joking"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"about this last episode. They were throwing around"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"terms like tranches"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"and bundling these"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"you know, mortgages"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"broken up into millions of pieces, that whole concept."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"But it was sort of just like,"
01:45:50;01:45:52;"what? Yeah,"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Jim Cramer slamming buttons"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"and screaming at you"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"through the TV."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"It's such esoteric knowledge."
01:46:00;01:46:02;"It was just like, what the hell is happening?"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"I mean, I remember"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"when Lehman Brothers went under there were some disturbing"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"images of the office"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"being kind of f***ed up and in disarray."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"And you were just like, oh s***, this is about to turn into something"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"big."
01:46:14;01:46:16;"You know, in classic American fashion"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"they always know how to keep things at"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"that low boil."
01:46:20;01:46:22;"The cusp."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Where disturbing things are happening."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Everybody feels uneasy."
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And you're waiting for it to fully boil over."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"Maybe a little bit of water here or there"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"happens, but it's never like the full pot"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"goes crazy and the flame gets it"
01:46:34;01:46:36;"and everything, you know?"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Constantly at that low boil."
01:46:38;01:46:40;"And I think Kanye really tapped into that with ""Love Lockdown."""
01:46:40;01:46:42;"I mean, you're totally right. I remember"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"at the time, I had been a fan of the first two"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"records. I was not down with 808s."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Same!"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"I'm really not."
01:46:50;01:46:52;"This sucks."
01:46:52;01:46:54;"It took me a while. It took me a while to come around to it."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"Same. Very acquired taste."
01:46:56;01:46:58;"Oh really? All three of you guys?"
01:46:58;01:47:00;"I've never felt more wrong in hindsight."
01:47:00;01:47:02;"Wow, I'm feeling a lot of"
01:47:02;01:47:04;"disturbia to know that"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"the whole TC crew was like that because"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"I was a big Kanye fan since"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"the first album and when that came out"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"I was like, I knew I'd been on the right horse."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"[laughs]"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"I remember when the third album"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"came out, you would still get people just being like,"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"""Oh, that guy's f***ing annoying."
01:47:20;01:47:22;"He's so full of himself. Why is he so much"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"better than anybody else?"""
01:47:24;01:47:26;"I remember just being like, ""Come on."
01:47:26;01:47:28;"These albums are great."""
01:47:28;01:47:30;"I really felt when that came out, maybe because it reminded me"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"of the X-Men theme song,"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"[sings]"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"which in a very oblique way, it doesn't actually sound like it."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"I really felt like,"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"""Oh yeah, he is the chosen one."""
01:47:40;01:47:42;"But yeah, that was his big classic"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"fourth album leap."
01:47:44;01:47:46;"He was on some different s***."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"You know what? I saw him on"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"tour on that album, was the Glow in the Dark"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"tour, and Rihanna opened"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"for him. - Oh, wow."
01:47:54;01:47:56;"- Maybe Pharrell was"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"there too? Definitely Rihanna was there."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"- I thought that was his third album."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"- No, this is his fourth. He had his trilogy"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"of college, dropout,"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"late registration,"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"and graduation."
01:48:08;01:48:10;"- Oh, that's right."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"- And then there was the long-rumored fourth album,"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"which would have continued the trajectory,"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"that was called ""Good A** Job."""
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Because after you graduate, then you"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"get a good a** job. That's how Kanye said it."
01:48:20;01:48:22;"But then he decided to cut it"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"off as a trilogy, and not take us towards"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"that good a** job place, and instead"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"take us to the austere,"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"disturbed world of"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"808s and Heartbreak, which was very jarring."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"But then that was a cool tour."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"He was alone on stage, on"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"this Martian terrain,"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"and he was talking to a robot the whole time"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"on some 2001 s***."
01:48:42;01:48:44;"- Wow. - And also, I feel like when I saw that,"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"when it really came together, that I was like,"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"""Oh yeah."" I really did have that feeling of like,"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"""Oh yeah, this guy's on some wild s***."""
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Because, you know, Rihanna"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"performed kind of like, you know,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"she's super cool, but like a pretty normal"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"pop show. And then he came on, he's alone,"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"and he's stumbling around on the Martian"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"territory, and then this thing"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"comes down, and it's like, ""Mr. West,"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"your spaceship has crash-landed"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"on Mars. There's not enough--"""
01:49:08;01:49:10;"And he's like, ""I gotta get back to Earth!"""
01:49:10;01:49:12;"And they're like, ""There's not enough fuel to get back!"""
01:49:12;01:49:14;"And he's like, ""What am I gonna do?"""
01:49:14;01:49:16;"Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. And like, the songs"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"would come in. It was this bizarre"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"one-man show, and I was like,"

01:52:30;01:52:32;"Ah, yeah."
01:52:32;01:52:34;"Like Gary Glytter. It reminds me of, do you know that"

01:52:44;01:52:46;"it's circusy, which is"
01:52:46;01:52:48;"her thing, right? She's a trapeze artist."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"Isn't she?"
01:52:50;01:52:52;"Whenever she performs in an award show, there's always"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"a trapeze. Yeah, I feel like"
01:52:54;01:52:56;"in this era, there's a lot of circus stuff."
01:52:56;01:52:58;"Britney Spears had a album called Circus"

01:53:10;01:53:12;"Circus record."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"I feel like there's also kind of a"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"sailor vibe to this somehow."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"Oh yeah, I feel that."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Circus is just land sailors."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"There's like something in common."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Sailors are also"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"up climbing poles"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"and swinging from things."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"And also,"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"I think, well, if you're into circus"
01:53:32;01:53:34;"vibes, you're also into pirate vibes."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"I think also"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"the Pirates of the Caribbean movies"
01:53:38;01:53:40;"were really big in this era."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"And I bet for a lot of people"

01:53:44;01:53:46;"Captain Jack Sparrow"
01:53:46;01:53:48;"but might have felt like a pirate."
01:53:48;01:53:50;"Yeah, they were landlocked."
01:53:50;01:53:52;"I can't go full pirate."
01:53:52;01:53:54;"I'm not going to pull this off."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"And then they're like, ""Oh, I could go kind of circus."""
01:53:56;01:53:58;"It weirdly presses,"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"hits a lot of the same notes."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Are you saying that there's a kinship between"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"pirates and clowns versus"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"the animosity between"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"policemen and firemen?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Policemen and firefighters? Oh, deeply."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Yeah, I think they're natural allies."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"They're almost like... I feel like this would be"
01:54:14;01:54:16;"some kind of Game of Thrones or"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"Lord of the Rings type thing where there's"
01:54:18;01:54:20;"two groups who are kind of like"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"allies and they don't call on each other"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"very often. But if they do,"
01:54:24;01:54:26;"it's kind of understood"
01:54:26;01:54:28;"that there's a sacred pact going back"
01:54:28;01:54:30;"generations that's like"
01:54:30;01:54:32;"my great-grandchildren..."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"Let's say great-great-grandchildren."
01:54:34;01:54:36;"We're all gone from the face of this Earth."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"It's whatever kind of hellscape"
01:54:38;01:54:40;"2150"
01:54:40;01:54:42;"US is."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"But if my great-great-grandchildren"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"somehow track down"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Jake's great-great-grandchildren"
01:54:48;01:54:50;"and said, ""I want to"
01:54:50;01:54:52;"do an internet radio show with you,"" there would be"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"that kind of ancient obligation"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"where they might be like, ""Whoa,"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"what's this all about?"" And then they might be like, ""Oh yeah, I've heard"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"about this. I've heard that our ancestors..."""
01:55:00;01:55:02;"Anyway, so that always happens"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"in these kind of fantasy things."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"If pirates ever needed to come to land,"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"I think the circus folk would"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"be obligated to give them a hot meal"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"and a warm bed."
01:55:12;01:55:14;"So we're on the number two"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"song of 2020 now, right?"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"Cardi B featuring"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"Megan Thee Stallion, ""WAP."""
01:55:20;01:55:22;"So this song's"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"still doing really big things."
01:55:24;01:55:30;"Seven days a week."
01:55:30;01:55:36;"I mean, this kind of song just gets better and better"
01:55:36;01:55:38;"every time you hear it."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"I've been seeing tweets, sort of with time,"
01:55:40;01:55:42;"that have said, ""Well, this song isn't"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"that dirty."" That doesn't seem"
01:55:44;01:55:46;"true to me. I haven't heard"
01:55:46;01:55:48;"it that many times just because I haven't..."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"I've not been riding in Ubers or Lyfts"
01:55:50;01:55:52;"or anything. What an aggressive"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"song to play in an Uber. Well,"
01:55:54;01:55:56;"but it would be like, classic."
01:55:56;01:55:58;"Right."
01:55:58;01:56:04;"Ezra, how many times have you heard"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"this song, and in what context?"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"I probably haven't heard the whole thing"
01:56:08;01:56:10;"in a long... since we listened to it,"
01:56:10;01:56:12;"but I just... clips always popping up,"
01:56:12;01:56:14;"you know? Yeah. Often on Instagram."
01:56:14;01:56:20;"Alright, well..."
01:56:20;01:56:24;"I mean, what else is there to say about"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"this song? I love that"
01:56:26;01:56:28;"drop in 2020. Yeah."
01:56:28;01:56:30;"'Cause also, you know, I think there's sometimes a"
01:56:30;01:56:32;"feeling like, there was a lot of talk"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"about in the Trump era, like, about"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"the protest music was gonna come"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"back, and people"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"wondering how artists were gonna react."
01:56:40;01:56:42;"This is this real-ass sh*t, you know, maybe"
