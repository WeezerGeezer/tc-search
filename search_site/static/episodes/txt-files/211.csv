00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. On this week's episode we hear new music from Vampire"
00:07;00:14;"Weekend and old music from Jay Gahl's band, two of the great East Coast"
00:14;00:20;"institutions of rock. All that, plus we're joined by extraordinary documentary"
00:20;00:28;"filmmaker Lance Oppenheim to talk about his new film Sperm World. This is Time Crisis"
00:28;00:32;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:45;00:50;"Robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:50;00:58;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:58;01:01;"And so I dealt you the blow."
01:01;01:04;"One of us had to go."
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:15;01:20;"I'll be the lonely man."
01:20;01:22;"Time crisis, back once again."
01:22;01:26;"One of our brothers is not here with us tonight."
01:26;01:31;"Seinfeld, he's got a day job."
01:31;01:32;"Don't quit your day job."
01:32;01:38;"Wait, have we ever talked on this show about the fact that the Grateful Dead had a song,"
01:38;01:43;"I don't think they ever recorded in a studio that they played in the late 70s, early 80s,"
01:43;01:47;"that was a Hunter Garcia composition called Don't Quit Your Day Job."
01:47;01:49;"And I don't know this song."
01:49;01:51;"See if we can find a recording of Don't Quit Your Day Job."
01:51;01:53;"I listened to it once or twice."
01:53;01:54;"It didn't make a big impression."
01:54;02:01;"But what I found interesting about it was that apparently the Deadheads did not respond"
02:01;02:03;"kindly to the sentiment."
02:03;02:05;"Was it like quit following us around?"
02:05;02:09;"Well, ship of fools kind of like, right?"
02:09;02:13;"Just look at the actual lyrics."
02:13;02:16;"Still got to work that eight hour day, whether you like that job or not."
02:16;02:21;"You'd better keep it on ice while you're lining up your long shot, which is to say, hey, hey,"
02:21;02:24;"keep your day job, whatever they say, keep your day job."
02:24;02:25;"Don't give it away."
02:25;02:28;"Keep your day job till your night job pays."
02:28;02:30;"Steady boys study that eight day hour."
02:30;02:33;"Never underrate that paycheck power."
02:33;02:36;"By now you know that the face on your dollar got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your"
02:36;02:41;"collar, which is to say, hey, hey, keep your day job, whatever they say, keep your day"
02:41;02:44;"job, don't give it away."
02:44;02:47;"Keep your day job till your night job pays."
02:47;02:48;"What year was that?"
02:48;02:51;"I think they debuted in like the late 70s."
02:51;02:53;"Kind of ahead of the curve a little bit."
02:53;02:58;"It sounds very like 80s to me."
02:58;03:00;"Like the dream is over."
03:00;03:02;"Yeah, when did they?"
03:02;03:03;"Enough with their idealism."
03:03;03:05;"Don't quit your day job."
03:05;03:06;"Keep grinding."
03:06;03:07;"Let's."
03:07;03:08;"OK, you're right."
03:08;03:09;"You're right."
03:09;03:11;"It's 80s first performance, August 28th, 82."
03:11;03:12;"OK."
03:12;03:15;"Reagan's a year in office."
03:15;03:17;"This is a this is a sigh."
03:17;03:19;"Well, the bright the Garcia."
03:19;03:20;"Yeah, yeah."
03:20;03:21;"Jerry Garcia."
03:21;03:27;"The he got that call from Reagan saying, well, you got to get to go."
03:27;03:28;"You got to turn these hippies into yuppies."
03:28;03:29;"Garcia."
03:29;03:33;"Jerry, there's a thing called a vibe shift."
03:33;03:41;"Jerry, my election is a vibe shift."
03:41;03:47;"I want you to tell those hippies to get get some day jobs."
03:47;03:52;"And I'm on the horn with Bruce Springsteen telling him that his next record, misunderstood"
03:52;03:58;"or not, has to have a kind of exciting tone in the American flag on the front."
03:58;04:02;"He's allowed to have whatever subtext he wants, but I can't have another Nebraska."
04:02;04:09;"This is this is my this is it's morning in America, Garcia."
04:09;04:11;"And you work for me far out, man."
04:11;04:12;"Far out."
04:12;04:21;"I can't think of a theme that the deadheads would be less receptive to than don't quit"
04:21;04:23;"your day job."
04:23;04:25;"That's really kind of kind of wild."
04:25;04:30;"Like their whole subculture was like people, you know, quitting their day job and following"
04:30;04:34;"them on tour and being like, you know what?"
04:34;04:37;"Forget this, the system of capitalism."
04:37;04:44;"Let's just like trade veggie burritos in the parking lot, camp out, have a good time."
04:44;04:50;"And then the dead get up there and are just like, plug back in, plug back into society."
04:50;04:52;"You could actually imagine."
04:52;04:58;"I mean, statistically, there must be somebody who had just quit their day job to follow"
04:58;05:04;"the dead in just a massive amount of acid or psilocybin at their first show in their"
05:04;05:06;"brand new life."
05:06;05:11;"And right when it's hitting, they hear a song they never heard before and they just see"
05:11;05:13;"Jerry singing."
05:13;05:16;"Keep your day job, don't give it away, keep your day job, whatever they say."
05:16;05:19;"And they were just like, what the fuck?"
05:19;05:21;"Like it is a message from the universe."
05:21;05:25;"You really fucked up, bro."
05:25;05:26;"Matt found it."
05:26;05:32;"He says, I'm just reading, I'm through, I'm on a message board and someone wrote, I was"
05:32;05:37;"reading the box of rain, the lyrics book, and it said that this song day job was removed"
05:37;05:41;"due to fan requests."
05:41;05:42;"Removed from the."
05:42;05:45;"I guess from like any."
05:45;05:46;"What is this?"
05:46;05:47;"This is a part of the record."
05:47;05:49;"I mean, that's insane."
05:49;05:53;"I originally liked the song, but was bummed to hear it at every other show."
05:53;05:54;"So they played it a lot."
05:54;05:55;"They didn't play it too much."
05:55;05:57;"Yeah, that's what they're saying."
05:57;05:59;"But then other people are like, it's a bummer sentiment."
05:59;06:02;"We got to add this to the Richard Pictures set."
06:02;06:03;"Yeah."
06:03;06:04;"Open with it."
06:04;06:05;"Absolutely."
06:05;06:06;"Kind of a US blues."
06:06;06:07;"Yeah."
06:08;06:09;"It's a real rewrite of US blues."
06:09;06:10;"Yeah."
06:10;06:29;"This is from the Hartford Civic Center."
06:29;06:30;"Oh, Connecticut."
06:30;06:31;"I like this."
06:31;06:32;"10 1483."
06:32;06:44;", I could see musically with the lyrics."
06:44;06:45;"This could be tongue in cheek."
06:45;06:56;"I mean, if I was like, stoned or drunk in a dead show in 83 and I was like, what are"
06:56;06:57;"these things?"
06:57;06:58;"It's about a day job."
06:58;07:01;"I would assume that it was like some sarcastic send up."
07:01;07:02;"Right."
07:02;07:03;"Because like US blues is kind of sarcastic."
07:03;07:04;"Yeah."
07:04;07:10;"I don't think that the dead is having a lot of earnest messaging."
07:10;07:23;"So it's weird to think about people taking this seriously."
07:23;07:36;"I kind of want to cover this."
07:36;07:42;"This is a perfect song for Richard Pictures where everyone is in their late 30s or 40s"
07:42;07:43;"and has day jobs."
07:43;07:44;"Yeah."
07:44;07:49;"You at this show, you could say, I know there might be some people in the crowd tonight"
07:49;07:53;"who quit their jobs to be here, but I want you to understand something about all these"
07:53;07:54;"guys on stage."
07:54;07:57;"We have day jobs."
07:57;07:58;"Do not follow us."
07:58;08:00;"This is a passion project."
08:00;08:04;"We're not playing that many shows."
08:04;08:06;"Wow."
08:06;08:16;"I love this."
08:16;08:19;"It has almost classic Jerry Cord moves."
08:19;08:20;"Yeah."
08:20;08:24;"This would have been great on In the Dark."
08:24;08:25;"Yeah."
08:25;08:44;"It is funny for them to say this is going to be the one we play at every show."
08:44;08:45;"I mean, it kind of rips."
08:45;08:55;"I can see them being psyched on here."
08:55;09:05;"Is Bob's guitar really out of tune?"
09:05;09:11;"I mean, somebody's out of tune."
09:11;09:17;"Well, I don't know if we can address the elephant in the room any further."
09:17;09:19;"What are you wearing, man?"
09:19;09:23;"Well, this was just cosmic timing."
09:23;09:28;"When I came home, there's this big box of stuff in the house from Adidas."
09:28;09:36;"I think primarily they were lacing my Significant Other with some swag, but there was something"
09:36;09:37;"in the box for me."
09:37;09:39;"I'd like to see her in this."
09:39;09:42;"Yeah, unless maybe this was meant for Rashida."
09:42;09:43;"Was there a note that said Ezra?"
09:43;09:46;"No, it was unclear."
09:46;09:49;"It's just my size."
09:49;09:52;"It's a classic black Adidas tracksuit."
09:52;09:55;"I'm not wearing the pants, but I have them in the other room."
09:55;10:00;"Basically it's just a classic black Adidas tracksuit, but on the top and the bottom,"
10:00;10:04;"it says KORN, K-O-R-N, like the Korn logo."
10:04;10:06;"That's all I know about it, but I got my favorite tracksuit."
10:06;10:07;"It's not like the Korn logo."
10:07;10:09;"It is the Korn logo."
10:09;10:10;"This is official Adidas."
10:10;10:14;"Actually, I don't know the backstory."
10:14;10:16;"Maybe Nick, you can do some research."
10:16;10:17;"Adidas and Korn linked up."
10:17;10:25;"Now, of course, I am a Korn fan, and I had at least one Korn CD in the '90s, and I always"
10:25;10:27;"had a soft spot for them."
10:27;10:33;"I remember they had a song called Adidas, except in their version, it's ""All Day I Dream About"
10:33;10:34;"Sex."""
10:34;10:35;"Okay."
10:35;10:36;"Took me a second there."
10:36;10:40;"But I guess probably ... I wonder if Adidas used to be more conservative, but after everything"
10:40;10:43;"they've been through with Kanye, they're probably just like, ""Oh, who gives a f*** this link"
10:43;10:44;"up with Korn?"
10:44;10:47;"This is the 'All Day I Dream About Sex' collection."""
10:47;10:50;"Actually, can we throw that on?"
10:50;10:52;"Korn, Adidas."
10:52;10:54;"Picture this."
10:54;11:11;"I pull up to one of your guys' houses, just f***ing blasting this, throw open the door."
11:11;11:20;"I get out in my full Adidas Korn tracksuit, just like, ""Let's f***ing go."""
11:20;11:33;"What year is this?"
11:33;11:34;"Late '90s, early 2000s."
11:34;11:35;"Let me check it out."
11:35;11:40;"I think this is my least favorite subgenre of rock."
11:40;11:41;"This is from 1997."
11:41;11:56;"So Korn and Adidas have an interesting history."
11:56;12:03;"So Adidas gave Korn free product back in the day, so around mid '90s, but they were unwilling"
12:03;12:05;"to sign the band to a proper deal."
12:05;12:09;"So instead, Korn inked a deal with Puma in '98."
12:09;12:11;"So they were officially repped by Puma."
12:11;12:19;"And then Jonathan Davis told Kerrang, ""We switched to Puma because they told us they'd"
12:19;12:23;"put us in a commercial and give us a little money to wear their s***."""
12:23;12:25;"I respect that."
12:25;12:28;"You want to know how it works?"
12:28;12:31;"They gave us a little money to wear their s***."
12:31;12:37;"And now, they've always wore those Adidas shoes."
12:37;12:39;"That I remember."
12:39;12:41;"The black Adidas they wore."
12:41;12:43;"Yeah, they're Adidas guys."
12:43;12:46;"And so now, I think time has passed."
12:46;12:52;"They have an official collab that apparently came out in late October."
12:52;12:55;"But the shoes I'd seen before, they look sick."
12:55;12:56;"Do you have the shoes on?"
12:56;12:57;"No, I don't know."
12:57;12:58;"I got to check."
12:58;12:59;"I saw there were some shoes."
12:59;13:06;"I mean, I don't know if anybody's repped Adidas as hard since Run-DMC."
13:06;13:10;"Run-DMC and then Korn are kind of the ultimate Adidas artists."
13:10;13:14;"Wait, so Jake, do you like any Korn songs?"
13:14;13:15;"No."
13:15;13:17;"Wait, not a good band."
13:17;13:19;"Freak on a leash."
13:19;13:25;"I use the term freak on a leash a lot though when I walk my dog."
13:25;13:28;"My dog's pretty mellow, but when I put her on the leash, that's when her anxiety and"
13:28;13:29;"her resistance..."
13:29;13:30;"Oh yeah, this is iconic."
13:30;13:49;"Epic Woodstock '99 performance to this song."
13:49;13:52;"Yeah, crazy."
13:52;13:54;"So far so good, right?"
13:54;13:56;"You know how I feel about Nine Inch Nails?"
13:56;13:57;"This is the same."
13:57;13:59;"Yeah, and this is a pretty Nine Inch Nails, this song."
13:59;14:05;"The same emotional palette, the same kind of vocal approach."
14:05;14:07;"Yeah."
14:07;14:11;"Very mannered, like aggro, angsty."
14:11;14:15;"I just can't take it seriously."
14:15;14:16;"What about when it gets big?"
14:16;14:17;"I take it even less seriously."
14:17;14:39;"Yeah, this is what I tapped out of alternative rock radio."
14:39;14:40;"Like '97."
14:40;14:46;"They started putting out this kind of garbage and I was like, ""This is active rock."""
14:46;14:50;"In radio there was this term ""active rock"" for this kind of music."
14:50;14:53;"I don't know that term ""active rock."""
14:53;14:56;"I was like, ""Oh, like mid-90s alt radio."""
14:56;14:59;"It was like, ""Oh, Green Day and Weezer and Nirvana and STP."""
14:59;15:00;"I was like, ""This is cool."""
15:00;15:13;"And then they started playing this kind of stuff and I was like, ""I'm out."""
15:13;15:16;"I feel ill listening to this music."
15:16;15:17;"It really is the worst crap."
15:17;15:18;"If I got you one, would you wear a Korn tracksuit?"
15:18;15:19;"Absolutely not."
15:19;15:20;"Really?"
15:20;15:21;"What about just the top?"
15:21;15:22;"A pair with a nice pair of jeans?"
15:22;15:23;"I couldn't do it, dude."
15:23;15:24;"Are you wearing a bucket hat, too?"
15:24;15:25;"What's going on with the hat?"
15:25;15:26;"Is that part of the-"
15:26;15:27;"Yeah, there's an Adidas- this is not Korn."
15:27;15:28;"This is not Korn brand."
15:28;15:29;"This is an Adidas bucket hat."
15:29;15:30;"An Adidas bucket hat."
15:30;15:31;"So I'm on the FaceTime, I'm looking at Ezra, he's rocking a white bucket hat."
15:31;15:32;"I'm like, ""Oh, I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
15:32;15:33;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
15:34;15:59;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
15:59;16:26;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
16:26;16:54;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
16:54;17:22;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
17:22;17:52;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
17:52;17:53;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
17:54;17:55;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
18:08;18:34;"I'm like, ""I'm gonna get a bucket hat."""
18:34;18:38;"I mean, there is something so hard about just track one."
18:38;18:40;"""Are you ready?"""
18:46;18:48;"This did not cross my desk in '94."
18:48;18:51;"Okay, but I feel like now you're finding a way into Korn."
18:51;18:53;"Now I have a way in."
18:53;18:54;"Start with the first half of the song."
18:54;18:55;"I kind of like this track."
18:55;18:56;"I wouldn't go that far."
18:56;18:57;"""You don't know the chances."""
18:58;18:59;"""What if I just..."""
18:59;19:00;"I do like it more than the later stuff, but I still don't like it."
19:00;19:01;"""What if I just..."""
19:01;19:02;"I do like it more than the later stuff, but I still don't like it."
19:02;19:03;"""What if I just..."""
19:03;19:04;"I do like it more than the later stuff, but I still don't like it."
19:04;19:05;"""What if I just..."""
19:05;19:06;"I do like it more than the later stuff, but I still don't like it."
19:06;19:07;"""What if I just..."""
19:07;19:08;"Fair enough."
19:08;19:09;"""What if I just..."""
19:09;19:10;"I'm allergic to that Trent Reznor energy."
19:10;19:11;"""What if I just..."""
19:11;19:12;"I'm allergic to that Trent Reznor energy."
19:12;19:13;"It's funny because, I mean, we've talked about this on the show, and I think people even"
19:13;19:14;"wrote in being like, ""I can't believe Jake doesn't like Nine Inch Nails."
19:14;19:15;"I'd like to share with him some..."""
19:15;19:16;"Didn't we have somebody who sent some songs to try to convert you, but you weren't feeling"
19:16;19:17;"any of them?"
19:17;19:18;"I think so."
19:18;19:19;"But I think there's probably a lot of Nine Inch Nails fans that if they met you and you"
19:19;19:49;"were just like, ""Man, I don't... corn is not for me."", they'd be like, ""Oh, totally."", and then you're like, ""It's got that Trent Reznor energy."", and they'd be like, ""Whoa, fall back, dude."", they'd be like, ""Oh, my..."", they're like, ""Oh, absolutely, corn sucks."", and you're like, ""Yeah, because it sounds like Nine Inch Nails, right?"", and they'd be like, ""How dare you?"""
19:49;19:51;"That'd be a funny Twitter poll."
19:51;19:56;"What percentage of Nine Inch Nails fans also love corn?"
19:56;20:00;"I think that's the equivalent of..."
20:00;20:05;"It'd be in the same way that you could picture..."
20:05;20:07;"All right, maybe we've heard enough corn."
20:07;20:08;"I kind of like it going in the background."
20:08;20:09;"Oh, you're getting in?"
20:09;20:13;"It's just kind of funny to have it in the background."
20:13;20:22;"I think it's the same way that there's probably some really highbrow radiohead fans, and you"
20:22;20:29;"could probably name a lot of '90s alternative bands or other bands like Muse or something."
20:29;20:31;"I was just going to say Muse."
20:31;20:35;"I bet if you were just kind of like, ""Man, I can't stand Muse, man,"" and they'd be like,"
20:35;20:38;"""Oh, I'm with you, I'm really not into Muse,"" and you'd be like, ""Exactly, this reminds"
20:38;20:42;"me of Radiohead, who sucks too."", they'd be like, ""Oh, my God, man."
20:42;20:45;"No, I thought we were bonding on hating Muse."""
20:45;20:46;"You're like, ""No."""
20:46;20:52;"In fact, if I had to pick one, I'd pick Muse, because at least they have the..."
20:52;20:53;"They're less pretentious."
20:54;20:55;"Like, ""Damn, dude."""
20:55;20:58;"Oh, that's really funny."
20:58;21:03;"Because I think Nine Inch Nails have their fans probably feel like it's more intellectual"
21:03;21:04;"than corn."
21:04;21:09;"And I mean, obviously, say what you will, Trent Reznor, he scored the Social Network."
21:09;21:12;"Well, yeah, and it's industrial."
21:12;21:17;"It's like with a lot of synth and it's not just like a rock band, which I think corn"
21:17;21:18;"is just..."
21:18;21:20;"I think it's just bass, guitar, and drums."
21:20;21:23;"Okay, wait, but I got a selling point for you, Jake."
21:23;21:24;"You know where corn's from?"
21:24;21:25;"Yeah."
21:25;21:26;"Bakersfield."
21:26;21:27;"Okay."
21:27;21:28;"Yeah, I figured that'd be..."
21:28;21:29;"I think you'd be into that."
21:29;21:33;"That's fascinating to me, especially when you consider the rich history of Bakersfield"
21:33;21:35;"country, Merle Haggard and Buck Owens."
21:35;21:36;"Oh, yeah, we must have..."
21:36;21:38;"I know we've talked about this before."
21:38;21:39;"Yeah."
21:39;21:40;"If you think about..."
21:40;21:48;"You picture 1950s Bakersfield with all the children of the Okies that had showed up there"
21:48;21:52;"during the Great Depression, and then their children would go on to make this country"
21:52;21:53;"music in Bakersfield."
21:53;22:00;"And it becomes like this rich chapter in American music history."
22:00;22:08;"And then fast forward 40 years, and what's the music coming out of Bakersfield?"
22:08;22:09;"Corn."
22:10;22:19;"That's a true Adam Curtis kind of term paper on the trajectory of American culture or whatever."
22:19;22:20;"Absolutely."
22:20;22:28;"You know, Jonathan Davis and a bunch of the other members of Corn, Fieldy and Monkey,"
22:28;22:34;"one of their first bands was a funk metal band with a great name, LAPD."
22:34;22:37;"That is sick."
22:37;22:45;"And they alternately would say that it stood for Love and Peace Dude, and then later, Laughing"
22:45;22:47;"as People Die."
22:47;22:48;"I like the first one."
22:48;22:51;"Can we see if we can pull up any LAPD, maybe their first album?"
22:51;22:55;"So is that like early 90s?"
22:55;22:57;"Their first EP came out in '89."
22:57;22:58;"Wow."
22:58;23:02;"So the Corn guys were like, they've been doing it for a minute."
23:02;23:04;"I mean, Jonathan Davis was born in '71."
23:04;23:07;"Yeah, so I guess they were recording when he was like 18."
23:07;23:12;"And then yeah, by the time Corn was big, he was in his 20s."
23:12;23:13;"Late 20s."
23:13;23:24;"I wonder if LAPD came in and played shows with like Fishbone and stuff."
23:24;23:25;"Right."
23:25;23:26;"What was the scene?"
23:26;23:28;"Probably some Chili's shows."
23:28;23:32;"Yeah, they must have loved the Chili Peppers."
23:32;23:40;"Interesting to like, like rip the funk out of it."
23:40;23:41;"Ooh, this is LAPD?"
23:41;23:42;"Yeah, I'm feeling this."
23:42;23:52;"Wait, but I'm seeing that there was a jazz group from the 70s called LAPD."
23:52;23:55;"So we're having some ambiguity here."
23:55;23:58;"Multiple LAPD bands."
23:58;23:59;"Love and Peace Dude."
23:59;24:02;"I wonder if they played a show with the Pimps."
24:02;24:03;"Wait, who were the Pimps?"
24:03;24:10;"The Pimps were a kind of like Chili Peppers adjacent kind of funk band that my uncle Ted"
24:10;24:11;"played bass in."
24:11;24:20;"Around this time, '89, '88, '87, '89, in that era."
24:20;24:26;"I remember when I was a kid, he had sent us a videotape of the Pimps playing like some"
24:26;24:29;"club in LA and I watched it so much."
24:29;24:37;"They had this song called ""Super Stupid Funky Spy"" because I'm a funky spy."
24:37;24:44;"I had this kind of sick riff."
24:44;24:49;"I think the Pimps had very brief interest from some labels."
24:49;24:50;"Okay."
24:50;24:52;"All right, what else is going on?"
24:52;24:54;"We said we'd talk about classical."
24:54;24:56;"Yeah, we're going to do some Vampire."
24:56;25:02;"So you guys, I know Nick has, Jake, you said you were blasting classical in the minivan?"
25:02;25:04;"I blasted classical in the minivan."
25:04;25:05;"Appreciate that."
25:05;25:07;"Doing 80 down the freeway."
25:07;25:08;"Hell yeah."
25:08;25:10;"Loving the sax solo."
25:10;25:11;"Yeah."
25:11;25:13;"That part is sick."
25:13;25:17;"And then I was like, you know how it is, you're listening to music, you're blasting it, you're"
25:17;25:18;"in the car."
25:18;25:20;"And I'm like, something about a crew?"
25:20;25:21;"Right."
25:21;25:23;"Is this about the Crisis Crew?"
25:23;25:25;"Is this an ode to the Crisis Crew?"
25:25;25:26;"No, it's not."
25:26;25:28;"How the crew with time becomes classical."
25:28;25:29;"Right."
25:29;25:31;"Yeah, it's actually cruel."
25:31;25:32;"Oh, it's..."
25:32;25:33;"Okay."
25:33;25:37;"That's a much more interesting lyric."
25:37;25:40;"How the crew with time."
25:40;25:41;"Somebody else could do it."
25:41;25:44;"I totally thought it was how the crew in time becomes classical."
25:44;25:45;"Yeah, no, cruel."
25:45;25:48;"But you're right, very similar words."
25:48;25:52;"We finally made a video that we're performing in that I actually like."
25:52;25:59;"I've always had an issue where with so many of our videos, we've rarely done a video that's"
25:59;26:01;"just the band standing somewhere playing."
26:01;26:05;"And with classical, we finally did one where it's just us on a green screen."
26:05;26:09;"Maybe that's what we should always just do, just get in front of a green screen."
26:09;26:15;"But the vast majority of the video is just us performing in a green screen."
26:15;26:18;"And I was very pleased with how it turned out."
26:18;26:23;"So often we make videos and I see the shots of us playing and I'm just like, ""Ah, it looks"
26:23;26:26;"like kind of funny or something."""
26:26;26:27;"But this one actually worked out."
26:27;26:28;"Yeah, I thought it was great."
26:28;26:31;"We had some cameos from RAL."
26:31;26:32;"That's right."
26:32;26:34;"And Guitar Tech, Josh Goldsmith."
26:34;26:36;"You ever met him?"
26:36;26:38;"Yes, that guy has an awesome look."
26:38;26:41;"Yeah, great dude."
26:41;26:44;"He was a guest on Vampire Campfire, the Vampire Weekend podcast."
26:44;26:45;"How's that going?"
26:45;26:46;"I haven't tuned in yet."
26:46;26:51;"We've only done two eps, but it's great."
26:51;26:55;"It's like kind of, we've been hanging out forever."
26:55;26:58;"So it's, I guess, not dissimilar from Time Crisis."
26:58;27:01;"We got certain things that just like you and me, we've had things that we've talked about"
27:01;27:03;"for borderline 20 years now."
27:03;27:09;"So is it highly focused on vampire material or are there a lot of tangents?"
27:09;27:11;"There's starting to be tangents."
27:11;27:13;"Like yeah, it is the Vampire Weekend podcast."
27:13;27:17;"So it's a good place for Vampire Weekend news."
27:17;27:22;"Like in the first episode, we talked a lot about the tour and all the openers."
27:22;27:23;"We talked about any of that."
27:23;27:33;"I think what Jake's getting at is how close is this going to edge into TC territory?"
27:33;27:34;"Are we feeling nervous?"
27:34;27:41;"Oh, I said on the last episode, I was uncomfortable with Vampire Campfire existing."
27:41;27:45;"Vampire Campfire, I guess I'll give it a hate listen."
27:45;27:51;"Negative thumbs down on YouTube."
27:51;27:58;"Jake's like zero corporate food history."
27:58;28:01;"No tasteful palate."
28:01;28:02;"It's also like shorter."
28:02;28:08;"We're keeping them short and punchy and I'm sure it'll never have the regularity of Time"
28:08;28:09;"Crisis."
28:09;28:16;"But yeah, it's a good place to kind of go deeper on kind of Vampire Weekend history,"
28:16;28:17;"future."
28:17;28:18;"Yeah."
28:18;28:22;"So like one episode we went deep on the tour and we got to like actually break down all"
28:22;28:23;"the openers."
28:23;28:24;"I don't know if I talked about that."
28:24;28:27;"I don't think we talked about that off mic."
28:27;28:29;"Maybe I don't remember us discussing it on the show."
28:29;28:34;"I mean, I know I don't want to, you know, no spoilers."
28:34;28:36;"I know you're having a Billy Joel cover band open for you."
28:36;28:37;"No, that's announced."
28:37;28:38;"Okay."
28:38;28:39;"Yeah."
28:39;28:40;"Turnstiles."
28:40;28:41;"Great."
28:41;28:42;"Love that."
28:42;28:49;"Which was funny when we announced the tour because a publicist said she got many responses"
28:49;28:54;"from press outlets when she sent out the press release where she talked about how the band"
28:54;28:59;"handpicked all the openers doing special bills for certain cities and breaking up all the"
28:59;29:04;"legs and say like very proud to announce in New York we'll have, we're doing a weekend"
29:04;29:05;"at the garden."
29:05;29:11;"We got Mark Ronson DJing Saturday night, brothers, Macklevich DJing Sunday and both Saturday"
29:11;29:15;"night and Sunday morning we'll be joined by turnstiles."
29:15;29:18;"And she got many people saying you had an S there."
29:18;29:24;"You clearly must be talking about the beloved new school hardcore band turnstile."
29:24;29:25;"Right."
29:25;29:30;"And we had to tell many people, first of all, how dare you?"
29:30;29:32;"Turnstiles is one of America's premier Billy Joel cover bands."
29:32;29:37;"Although actually I've noticed something that, cause I've seen, they've been doing a little"
29:37;29:40;"bit of press already about the show."
29:40;29:43;"And I think, I think this is, maybe this is true with Richard Pictures too."
29:43;29:48;"There's like a thing, maybe cover band is not like the preferred way to call it."
29:48;29:50;"It's tribute act I think is the best."
29:50;29:54;"I refer to Richard Pictures as a cover band because we're a bar band."
29:54;29:55;"I mean, it's a cover band."
29:55;29:56;"Right."
29:56;29:58;"See, if you, if you see any video of turnstiles, they're not a bar band."
29:58;30:01;"They're like doing like pretty like significant touring."
30:01;30:04;"And it's like, it's like a real show with lights and everything."
30:04;30:07;"I think as soon as you quit your day job, there you go."
30:07;30:09;"It becomes a tribute band."
30:09;30:18;"And I don't know exactly if the guys in the band, it seems like, like some of them might"
30:18;30:19;"do it full time."
30:19;30:24;"And it definitely seems like the lead singer, Tony Monaco, he's like full time music industry"
30:24;30:25;"kind of guy."
30:25;30:29;"Like he has his own company called Tony Monaco productions or something like that."
30:29;30:30;"So there is a Billy."
30:30;30:33;"There is like a guy playing piano and singing all of the songs."
30:33;30:34;"Yeah."
30:34;30:35;"Tony Monaco."
30:35;30:36;"Okay."
30:36;30:37;"They don't like have different guys."
30:37;30:38;"Okay."
30:38;30:44;"As you might notice, do you think, I do believe it might have to do with the level of like"
30:44;30:46;"not just passion, but time you give it."
30:46;30:51;"But is there also possibly something with like the legality of saying like an interpolation"
30:51;30:55;"or something like it's a tribute and not a cover, like especially at the, maybe at their"
30:55;30:58;"size you don't want to."
30:58;30:59;"Oh."
30:59;31:03;"I mean, I think anybody's allowed to cover a song."
31:03;31:09;"I'd like to think that the long arm of the law is not coming after a cover band."
31:09;31:11;"Are you a cover band or are you a tribute act?"
31:11;31:12;"A tribute act."
31:12;31:13;"All right."
31:13;31:14;"Let me see your documentation on that."
31:14;31:15;"And you're free to go."
31:15;31:18;"Let me see your tax ID number."
31:18;31:20;"Just getting pulled over in Oklahoma."
31:20;31:22;"It's like Blues Brothers."
31:22;31:23;"Boys."
31:23;31:29;"Oh, you boys, you boys are a long way from New York."
31:29;31:31;"We don't get too many city folk out here."
31:31;31:32;"Yeah."
31:32;31:34;"We're just a bunch of musicians."
31:34;31:35;"Oh, musicians."
31:35;31:38;"Boy, we've had a lot of musicians come through."
31:38;31:39;"They like to cause trouble."
31:39;31:40;"What do you guys do?"
31:40;31:41;"An original material?"
31:41;31:42;"No, sir."
31:42;31:43;"No original material."
31:43;31:48;"Everyone in the car has got kiss face paint on."
31:48;31:50;"We are a tribute act."
31:50;31:51;"Tribute act."
31:51;31:53;"You sure you're not a cover band?"
31:53;31:54;"No, sir."
31:54;31:56;"We are more or less professional."
31:56;31:57;"Many of us have quit our day jobs."
31:57;32:03;"We are a tribute act because we don't really appreciate cover bands coming through out"
32:03;32:04;"of this county."
32:04;32:05;"No, sir."
32:05;32:07;"We're, we're, it's all in the up and up."
32:07;32:09;"We are a tribute act."
32:09;32:10;"Get out of the car."
32:10;32:11;"That is legally certified."
32:11;32:12;"Certified."
32:12;32:18;"But yeah, and I know a little bit about Turnstiles."
32:18;32:23;"The Tony Monaco, the singer spent years of his life living on Long Island."
32:23;32:26;"They're based in Florida now, but he's a."
32:26;32:30;"They're one of the leading lights of the, of the Billy cover world."
32:30;32:35;"And if you watch the videos of them, you can tell that their shows, yeah, not really bar"
32:35;32:36;"band."
32:36;32:38;"It's like, you know, theaters and stuff."
32:38;32:39;"Yeah."
32:39;32:40;"All sorts of different stuff."
32:40;32:43;"And anyway, that, that'll be a special and that one's for New York only."
32:43;32:47;"And just like in LA, we're doing the Scott night with the Voodoo Glow Skulls and English"
32:47;32:50;"beat and stuff like that."
32:50;32:54;"Austin, the next show, the one that'll be our first show that'll be happening."
32:54;32:55;"Not too long."
32:55;32:56;"Opener?"
32:56;32:57;"Yeah."
32:57;32:58;"Opener in Austin."
32:58;33:02;"Tight because you know, it's like the middle of the day and it's the eclipse and, and all"
33:02;33:04;"that perhaps some special guests."
33:04;33:05;"Cool."
33:05;33:07;"Keep your eyes peeled for that."
33:07;33:11;"But anyway, these are the types of things we've been talking about on Vampire Campfire."
33:11;33:16;"And there is a part of me that would actually enjoy telling you some of the tangents we've"
33:16;33:19;"gone on, but that's getting a little bit too crazy."
33:19;33:25;"If I go from Vampire Campfire back to TC and say like, you know, they had told me something"
33:25;33:27;"interesting and kind of got us talking."
33:27;33:30;"I think that's, that's too much repeat, repeated content."
33:30;33:31;"That's too deep."
33:31;33:32;"Yeah."
33:32;33:34;"Here's another Twitter poll."
33:34;33:38;"How many people, how many time crisis fans are listening to vampire?"
33:38;33:40;"I can't say it."
33:40;33:41;"Vampire Campfire."
33:41;33:42;"Yeah."
33:42;33:45;"Vampire Campfire fans are called VCs."
33:45;33:46;"VCs."
33:46;33:47;"Oh yeah."
33:47;33:48;"VC heads."
33:48;33:49;"VCRs."
33:49;33:52;"And someone's like, I can't stand Vampire Campfire."
33:52;33:53;"So annoying."
33:53;33:59;"I'm like, I'm going to get TC energy and someone's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
33:59;34:00;"Yeah."
34:01;34:02;"Right."
34:02;34:03;"Like now it's like, yeah."
34:03;34:05;"You can't stand time crisis."
34:05;34:06;"And now I got vampire campfire."
34:06;34:08;"Well, so don't listen then."
34:08;34:10;"Don't listen to haters."
34:10;34:15;"But anyway, that's the place to go for the hardcore VW content."
34:15;34:17;"I mean, you know, it's so much as music."
34:17;34:19;"I feel like it speaks for itself."
34:19;34:20;"Let's just throw on classical."
34:20;34:24;"Listen to it."
34:24;34:33;"I haven't listened to classical since the video shoot."
34:33;34:34;"It's funny."
34:34;34:41;"When we were first working on this, I wondered if like the guitar tone was like too distorted."
34:41;34:42;"And now I listen to it."
34:42;34:43;"I'm like, what was I scared of?"
34:43;34:44;"It sounds normal."
34:44;34:45;"I'm going to pull up the lyrics."
34:45;34:46;"Oh yeah."
34:46;34:47;"Right."
34:47;34:48;"Now you can actually know what I'm saying."
34:48;34:50;"can actually know what I'm saying."
35:10;35:21;">> This is bleak, dude."
35:24;35:26;">> I'm sorry, I hate you."
35:34;35:35;">> How is this song bleak?"
35:35;35:37;"It's about Shake Shack."
35:37;35:41;"Just a feel good burgers and shakes song."
35:43;35:45;">> It's a classic spot, man."
35:50;35:53;">> This song is kind of just about some of the cool"
35:53;35:58;"developments in the burger chain world over the past 20 years."
36:00;36:03;">> Quality's gone up quite a bit."
36:03;36:09;">> Now, you go to any mid-sized US city, you're going to have five guys, a Shake Shack,"
36:09;36:14;"maybe some independent stuff, like the real interesting stuff happening in the burger world."
36:37;36:38;">> I like this."
36:38;36:41;"I'm spending some time with the lyrics and thinking about it,"
36:41;36:45;"trying to formulate a thought here while the music plays."
36:45;36:49;"But, I mean, classical is a word."
36:49;36:52;"I love this part."
36:52;36:59;">> Yeah, we had one of RL's go-to saxophone guys, Henry Solomon."
36:59;37:04;"I think he probably ripped like 40 minutes of stuff, and then we took all our favorite parts"
37:04;37:08;"and kind of arranged and rearranged it."
37:08;37:13;"I think this solo is actually both alto and tenor."
37:13;37:17;">> So when he heard it, was he just like, ""What the hell is this?"""
37:17;37:19;"I didn't play that."
37:19;37:23;">> Yeah, he probably didn't remember it like, ""Oh, yeah, the solo I did."""
37:27;37:28;">> I love this breakdown."
37:28;37:32;"This is one of my favorite parts coming up."
37:32;37:35;"RL's little slide up here."
38:04;38:09;">> I mean, it's like the winner's right history."
38:09;38:11;"I mean, that's a--yeah, exactly."
38:11;38:17;"I mean, in classical, it's such a word that has the--it's like classical music."
38:17;38:21;"It has this veneer of respectability."
38:21;38:24;">> Yeah, a positive association."
38:24;38:29;">> Officially sanctioned status or something."
38:29;38:30;">> Big slowdown."
38:33;38:38;">> It's a cool flip on the classical meaning of classical."
38:38;38:39;">> Yeah, it's funny."
38:39;38:42;"Like, this song contains the word ""bleak,"" and you said it was bleak."
38:42;38:46;"And as I've been doing press, I've had more and more people kind of saying,"
38:46;38:47;"""Well, is this album bleak?"""
38:47;38:52;"And songs seem to paint a kind of dark view of the world."
38:52;38:54;"But, you know, I know--"
38:54;38:55;">> The music doesn't."
38:55;38:56;">> No, the music doesn't."
38:56;39:00;"And also, I know this sounds like something that songwriters say just to,"
39:00;39:04;"like, not have to be pinned down, but, like, in this song,"
39:04;39:07;"I think it's fairly obvious that there's, like--"
39:07;39:11;"there's both kind of, like, a person thinking something,"
39:11;39:13;"and there's, like, another voice, too."
39:13;39:16;"Like, you know, in that verse where there's the line,"
39:16;39:19;"""A staircase up to nothingness inside your DNA,"""
39:19;39:21;"well, that's a bleak sunrise, which is, in a way,"
39:21;39:24;"is saying, like, if you accept that life is meaningless,"
39:24;39:27;"and you think that all we are is just a bunch of proteins"
39:27;39:31;"that kind of randomly got thrown together by chaos,"
39:31;39:35;"you're going to wake up every day to a bleak sunrise"
39:35;39:38;"because it's all meaningless, you know, if you have that feeling."
39:38;39:42;"So I think, ultimately, this song is not endorsing that,"
39:42;39:45;"but it's a real feeling everybody has at times."
39:45;39:50;"And I like the fact that this song ended up being track two on the record,"
39:50;39:54;"and I think it was kind of important that some of these songs"
39:54;39:57;"that talk about some bleak stuff are, like, clustered around the beginning,"
39:57;40:00;"because ultimately the record kind of goes on a journey,"
40:00;40:03;"and I don't necessarily endorse the belief that just, like,"
40:03;40:07;"""Well, life is just harsh, and the winner's right history,"
40:07;40:09;"and there's nothing good about it."""
40:09;40:10;"No, of course not."
40:10;40:11;"Yeah, but I think that, you know--"
40:11;40:14;"but that's a real thing that everybody feels every now and then,"
40:14;40:16;"so I think that's kind of part of it."
40:16;40:20;"And I think one thing I was thinking about recently is--"
40:20;40:24;"I also really like how this song has, like, a proper pre-chorus into the chorus,"
40:24;40:28;"the pre-chorus being the ""untrue, unkind, and unnatural,"""
40:28;40:30;"how the cruel time becomes classical, and then it picks up,"
40:30;40:33;"""I know that wall is fall, shake, shake."""
40:33;40:34;"But I was thinking about the--"
40:34;40:36;"""Shake, shack."""
40:36;40:40;"""I know that shake, shack, Burger King."""
40:40;40:43;"""Untrue, unkind, and unnatural."""
40:43;40:45;"I think I like that there's, like--"
40:45;40:48;"it reminded me of old-fashioned songwriting, and there's this old--"
40:48;40:50;"I think Frank Sinatra did some versions of it,"
40:50;40:54;"a song called ""Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered."""
40:54;40:57;"""Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered."""
40:57;41:01;"And I like that kind of, like, old-school songwriting,"
41:01;41:04;"where it's not, like, necessarily a smart-aleck play on words,"
41:04;41:07;"but just a little bit of alliteration,"
41:07;41:11;"a little bit of, like, sticking on a theme."
41:11;41:12;"But yeah, that's classical."
41:12;41:14;"That came out a couple weeks ago."
41:14;41:16;"That one's going to be fun to play live."
41:16;41:18;"Good energy."
41:18;41:20;"And then the one that we just dropped,"
41:20;41:23;"the final little drop before the album,"
41:23;41:26;"which comes out this week,"
41:26;41:29;"is ""Mary Boone."""
41:29;41:31;"Have you ever played this for you, Jake?"
41:31;41:33;"No, and I won't be able to find the lyrics on Genius,"
41:33;41:34;"because it's not out yet."
41:34;41:35;"All right, well, let's--"
41:35;41:36;"Let's give it a listen."

45:47;45:49;"20th century New York. That's right."
45:49;45:50;"Which..."
45:50;45:51;"Yeah."
45:51;45:54;"I was picturing you getting on a train in New Jersey,"
45:54;45:55;"not Brooklyn,"
45:55;45:58;"and going into Manhattan and, like, going to a theater,"
45:58;46:00;"going to see a gallery show or..."
46:00;46:03;"Yeah, I mean, Mary Boone, she showed, like, yeah,"
46:03;46:06;"some of the biggest, like, Julian Schnabel, right?"
46:06;46:09;"And, like, David Salle, I think."
46:09;46:12;"And would she have shown Basquiat or that was..."
46:12;46:16;"I don't know who his major dealer was. Maybe."
46:16;46:17;"Her major..."
46:17;46:21;"Yeah, it looks like Julian Schnabel was her big one."
46:21;46:25;"But, yes, she also did deal with Basquiat."
46:25;46:27;"Yeah, all the big '80s."
46:27;46:31;"Eric Fischl, Enzo Kiefer, Barbara Kruger."
46:31;46:33;"Yeah, crazy."
46:33;46:34;"Yeah, major."
46:34;46:37;"She's like, yeah, like this Werner of the '80s, basically."
46:37;46:39;"That's..."
46:39;46:42;"I saw that title and I was like, ooh, that's..."
46:42;46:43;"That's a..."
46:43;46:46;"You have my attention, sir."
46:46;46:48;"You was on Mary Boone."
46:48;46:53;"Yeah, you zeroed in on that line about came in from Jersey, not from Brooklyn."
46:53;46:57;"And, like, yeah, when I thought about, is this song particularly about Mary Boone,"
46:57;47:00;"the person, her life, her journey, whatever?"
47:00;47:01;"Not really."
47:01;47:04;"The song is addressed to Mary Boone."
47:04;47:08;"I mean, I think I like the fact that she came from small town Pennsylvania"
47:08;47:10;"and came to New York."
47:10;47:14;"She's a daughter of, I think, Egyptian immigrants,"
47:14;47:17;"grew up in small town Pennsylvania, came to New York,"
47:17;47:22;"obviously became a huge deal in the New York art world."
47:22;47:27;"But I like the idea that, you know, this is about the next generation, maybe."
47:27;47:32;"I mean, when I picture these words, like the opening is ""Painted White"","
47:32;47:35;"""New in town"", ""You weren't hiring, but I was looking""."
47:35;47:37;"Like, you know, it's what is a big city like New York?"
47:37;47:43;"It's a wave after wave of ambitious people in various industries"
47:43;47:46;"coming to, like, you know, make a name for themselves."
47:46;47:51;"And over and over again, the, you know, the tide,"
47:51;47:54;"the waves keep crashing new people."
47:54;47:57;"Whether it's Steve Forbert or Mary Boone, I mean."
47:57;47:59;"That's right. Kind of similar era."
47:59;48:01;"And I like the idea of this person,"
48:01;48:04;"the person who's like trying to get her attention."
48:04;48:06;"And maybe the weird linger."
48:06;48:08;"What was that lyric you had?"
48:08;48:11;"Something, something, but you weren't hiring. What was the lyric?"
48:11;48:15;"Well, the opening of the song is ""Painted White"", ""New in town"","
48:15;48:18;"""You weren't hiring, but I was looking""."
48:18;48:21;"Yeah. That reminds me of like so much of like,"
48:21;48:24;"being an artist or being interested in the art world,"
48:24;48:28;"but it's such a, it's such an impenetrable kind of opaque world,"
48:28;48:30;"especially when you're young."
48:30;48:33;"And you don't know anyone in it and you kind of go into these big,"
48:33;48:38;"like fancy, like cavernous galleries in New York."
48:38;48:41;"And there's the people like working there at the desk have such like"
48:41;48:45;"severe kind of intense body language."
48:45;48:48;"And you're just like, can I even say hi?"
48:48;48:50;"Like, how does this work?"
48:50;48:53;"I feel so intimidated by this whole thing."
48:53;48:55;"And even when you see those people,"
48:55;48:58;"let alone these like really intense gallerists,"
48:58;49:01;"but even just the people working the front desk or something,"
49:01;49:05;"the idea that maybe they're from like a small town in Connecticut or"
49:05;49:07;"Massachusetts, you know, it just like,"
49:07;49:12;"there's very little trace left of that, whatever previous life they had,"
49:12;49:14;"because you know, in the New York art world, you have to,"
49:14;49:17;"you kind of have to be some type of character."
49:17;49:19;"You at least have to get with the program and it's,"
49:19;49:23;"it can be extremely highbrow. Yeah. So there's definitely some,"
49:23;49:25;"I think the song has some like tri-state energy."
49:25;49:27;"And as of recording this,"
49:27;49:31;"we still haven't even finished the visual that's going to go along with it."
49:31;49:34;"It's not, not a proper music video, like classical,"
49:34;49:38;"but the image I kept coming back to, because you know,"
49:38;49:43;"sometimes you have to just come up with like a visual to go on YouTube or"
49:43;49:45;"any type of social media."
49:45;49:49;"And then when I was trying to just like drill down on like the visual,"
49:49;49:51;"and I talked about this quite a bit with Nick,"
49:51;49:53;"Nick helped me kick around ideas."
49:53;49:55;"And one thing I kept coming back to,"
49:55;50:00;"if I just had to boil down one image of something in the real world that"
50:00;50:01;"represented this song,"
50:01;50:04;"I just kept coming back to going through the Lincoln tunnel."
50:04;50:08;"And at some point I had more, more ambitious ideas."
50:08;50:13;"I was pitching to Nick a full reverse Sopranos where I was like, all right,"
50:13;50:16;"picture this. I walk out in front of the Sopranos house,"
50:16;50:20;"Despot picks me up and then we drive backwards through the Sopranos opening"
50:20;50:22;"credits. And it ends with us going into the tunnel."
50:22;50:26;"Instead of lighting a cigar, you're hitting the vape pen."
50:26;50:29;"Yeah, I'm hitting a vape pen. Cause as any Sopranos fan knows,"
50:29;50:33;"the beginning of the Sopranos opening credits is Tony exiting the Lincoln"
50:33;50:34;"tunnel."
50:34;50:37;"Got you all set off a gun."
50:37;50:40;"That seemed a little bit too ambitious."
50:40;50:45;"And yeah, we'll do, we'll do that one day. We'll do something else."
50:45;50:48;"But then I just kept coming back to like somebody just going into the Lincoln"
50:48;50:51;"tunnel. And I believe,"
50:51;50:53;"even though I haven't seen the final footage,"
50:53;50:58;"what we ended up with was Despot driving into the Lincoln tunnel."
50:58;50:59;"Nice."
50:59;51:02;"And I think for people, I guess maybe not for you, Jake,"
51:02;51:04;"cause when you're coming in from Connecticut,"
51:04;51:05;"No tunnels."
51:05;51:08;"You're taking the Throgs Neck bridge or the Dryboro or what?"
51:08;51:11;"I'm trying to remember."
51:11;51:13;"Were you like driving through the Bronx basically?"
51:13;51:16;"Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's yeah, exactly."
51:16;51:19;"Drive by Yankee stadium and then down through Harlem basically."
51:19;51:20;"Right."
51:20;51:21;"You're a bridge guy."
51:21;51:22;"The one we were talking about,"
51:22;51:25;"I did that drive a lot into the Lincoln tunnel."
51:25;51:28;"It is, you know, every turn when you talked about the memory,"
51:28;51:31;"like Jake was bringing up this, this idea of memories,"
51:31;51:35;"there's something about entering the tunnel and knowing every turn in it"
51:35;51:38;"coming up and knowing how long you're underneath the tunnel."
51:38;51:41;"I mean, it's fairly iconic so much so that as we talked about,"
51:41;51:45;"a lot of people film themselves going into the Lincoln tunnel."
51:45;51:47;"Right. I bet you had a lot of that on YouTube."
51:47;51:48;"Yeah. A lot of that on YouTube."
51:48;51:52;"We actually licensed some film from a YouTuber named Frank Palmisano."
51:52;51:55;"Great name."
51:55;51:57;"And again, at the time of recording this,"
51:57;52:01;"I believe we filmed our own version to make it a little more specific,"
52:01;52:04;"but we did license this footage from Frank, which was great,"
52:04;52:07;"which was him driving through, I think a couple of years ago."
52:07;52:10;"And I mean, it's such an engineering Marvel,"
52:10;52:12;"but what I always loved about it too is like,"
52:12;52:15;"you're kind of heading towards the city and then you just do this loop and"
52:15;52:20;"head down and you catch a little glimpse of the New York skyline as you're"
52:20;52:23;"looping down towards the tunnel."
52:23;52:26;"And then there's this moment too, when you're down in the,"
52:26;52:29;"this kind of valley, which is the entrance to the tunnel."
52:29;52:32;"And you look up and you realize you're surrounded by cliffs."
52:32;52:36;"There are these like houses that are maybe 200 feet above you because that"
52:36;52:39;"part of New Jersey is like, it's like the Highlands, you know,"
52:39;52:43;"like Weehawken and all these towns are built into kind of like these like"
52:43;52:47;"rocks, these bluffs kind of overlooking the Hudson river."
52:47;52:51;"And then, so you wind down and then you go into the tunnel and then it's"
52:51;52:54;"amazing. You know, like you're, you don't want to think about it too much,"
52:54;52:56;"but you're, when was that built?"
52:56;52:59;"A hundred plus years ago."
52:59;53:01;"I did this always blows my mind. How'd they build?"
53:01;53:02;"Yeah, that's crazy."
53:02;53:05;"I always look at this stuff. I always ask my dad."
53:05;53:07;"Cause you know, my dad was a studied mine engineering."
53:07;53:08;"He ended up being his."
53:08;53:10;"1934."
53:10;53:12;"Literally a hundred years ago."
53:12;53:13;"Yep."
53:13;53:15;"It opened in 37."
53:15;53:18;"By the way, that's insane. It was a."
53:18;53:19;"Four."
53:19;53:21;"I mean, that just seems like it should take so much longer."
53:21;53:25;"It's the construction started in 34 and it opened in 37."
53:25;53:26;"Wow."
53:26;53:28;"Today it would take 20 years."
53:28;53:29;"Oh yeah."
53:29;53:34;"I don't ever want to be like I did that day."
53:34;53:38;"Take me to the place I love."
53:38;53:40;"Take me all the way."
53:40;53:45;"I don't ever want to be like I did that day."
53:45;53:49;"Take me to the place I love."
53:49;53:51;"Take me all the way."
53:51;53:54;"Yeah."
53:57;54:00;"Oh no, no, no."
54:00;54:02;"Yeah, yeah."
54:02;54:05;"Love me that day."
54:05;54:08;"Yeah, yeah."
54:08;54:13;"One more time."
54:13;54:17;"Go to the Red Shirt Town."
54:17;54:19;"It's where I'm really so glad."
54:19;54:22;"Go to the Red Shirt Town."
54:22;54:24;"I could not get enough."
54:24;54:27;"Go to the Red Shirt Town."
54:27;54:30;"Oh God, oh, by my love."
54:30;54:33;"Go to the Red Shirt Town."
54:33;54:36;"I'd give my life away."
54:36;54:38;"I don't make them like I used to."
54:38;54:40;"Imagine all that red tape trying to build a tunnel."
54:40;54:44;"So you were telling me, me and my friends, we want to build a tunnel."
54:44;54:47;"And we got to deal with all this red tape."
54:47;54:50;"And all these woke kids too, huh?"
54:50;54:55;"The cranky old man podcast."
54:55;54:58;"Talking about governmental red tape."
54:58;54:59;"Club Random."
54:59;55:00;"Oh yeah, dude."
55:00;55:05;"Asked one of the young guys if he can hold the drill."
55:05;55:07;"And he says."
55:07;55:09;"He has an anxiety attack."
55:09;55:10;"Yeah, he has an anxiety attack."
55:10;55:12;"Goes home for three months."
55:12;55:15;"We're building a tunnel here."
55:15;55:18;"I remember a few weeks ago we were talking about Ezra making podcast appearances."
55:18;55:21;"And I was really pushing hard for Ezra trying to get on Club Random."
55:21;55:23;"Oh, maybe I should."
55:23;55:25;"See, I'm coming on Club Random."
55:25;55:31;"Bill, I'm coming on Club Random, but I only want to talk about how difficult it would be to build the Lincoln Tunnel today."
55:31;55:37;"Oh, I love that."
55:37;55:39;"That's catnip for Bill."
55:39;55:40;"That is catnip."
55:40;55:42;"But also, I know there's an easy answer."
55:42;55:44;"And even think about it."
55:44;55:46;"They built the Brooklyn Bridge in the 19th century."
55:46;55:47;"Yeah."
55:47;55:50;"I know it involves caissons."
55:50;55:54;"But let's just logically think about it."
55:54;55:56;"We get the Crisis crew."
55:56;55:58;"We get the Vampire Campfire crew."
55:58;56:00;"We get you guys, the Lunch Pail Boys."
56:00;56:02;"All the crews unite."
56:02;56:04;"We get the guys from Richard Pictures."
56:04;56:06;"Maybe some of our old friends from high school."
56:06;56:10;"We get together like a dream team of about 100 guys."
56:10;56:13;"And women."
56:13;56:20;"And we say, ""All right, we're going to build a tunnel underneath the Hudson River."""
56:20;56:29;"I mean, look, I feel like if you gave me 100 people and said, ""Build a house,"" we could probably figure out how to build a house."
56:29;56:32;"It might not last forever, but we could build a dwelling."
56:32;56:33;"Yeah."
56:33;56:40;"If you got 100 people, even great painters and musicians, and said, ""All right, guys, build the Lincoln Tunnel."""
56:40;56:41;"Where do we even start with that?"
56:41;56:44;"Even if they said, ""Okay, guys, how about this? Build the Brooklyn Bridge."""
56:44;56:47;"You have all the time you need, all the materials you need."
56:47;56:50;"How do we do that?"
56:50;56:51;"I have no idea."
56:51;56:52;"How, Sway?"
56:52;56:54;"Nick, how do you build that?"
56:54;56:56;"I'm getting nauseous just thinking about it."
56:56;56:57;"No, the first step."
56:57;56:58;"Listen."
56:58;57:00;"What's the first step?"
57:00;57:01;"This is it."
57:01;57:02;"This is for all the marbles."
57:02;57:04;"What's out the tape measure?"
57:04;57:06;"Okay, how wide is the river?"
57:06;57:07;"All right, Jake."
57:07;57:09;"Jake, you have unlimited resources."
57:09;57:14;"You have all the manpower you need, everything you need, and this is going to save America."
57:14;57:18;"All you need to do is just be in charge of this plan to build the Brooklyn Bridge."
57:18;57:20;"We got all the stone you need."
57:20;57:23;"We got thousands of Irish and Italian immigrants."
57:23;57:25;"How do you do it?"
57:25;57:26;"What's step one?"
57:26;57:28;"This is the first TC reality show."
57:28;57:36;"I think we're going to get a bunch of Gen Z together, and we're going to give them unlimited resources, but they have to build it."
57:36;57:37;"The Brooklyn Bridge."
57:37;57:39;"They have to build the Brooklyn Bridge."
57:39;57:43;"But it's like they have to build the Brooklyn Bridge, and they're like, ""Where?"""
57:43;57:48;"You're just like, ""Across this random lake in Wisconsin."""
57:48;58:02;"It has to be like about a one to four ratio model of the Brooklyn Bridge across a lake that we bought in rural Wisconsin."
58:02;58:06;"And is the concept that no one has any engineering training?"
58:06;58:13;"Or could we hire a 26-year-old person who just got out of engineering school?"
58:13;58:15;"And by the way, I want to be clear about something."
58:15;58:18;"I'm not ragging on millennials or Gen Z."
58:18;58:24;"What I'm saying is I just want everybody to think about this."
58:24;58:26;"I'm not saying this to diss the young generation."
58:26;58:28;"I'm saying this to praise."
58:28;58:31;"I come here not to diss the Zoomers."
58:31;58:36;"I come here to praise whoever it was that did these things."
58:36;58:37;"The greatest generation."
58:37;58:39;"I mean, and Brooklyn Bridge is even before the greatest generation."
58:39;58:41;"1870."
58:41;58:43;"It was like Civil War veterans."
58:43;58:47;"It was 1870, and it took 13 years."
58:47;58:49;"I think it finished in '83."
58:49;58:53;"All I'm saying is I just want everybody at home to think about this."
58:53;58:54;"You."
58:54;58:58;"Maybe your TC listeners span the generation."
58:58;59:03;"So whatever generation you are, all I'm saying is you're in charge of this one project."
59:03;59:07;"You have the rest of your life to do it, and you have unlimited resources and manpower."
59:07;59:11;"All you need to do is tell me, how do you make that bridge?"
59:11;59:16;"How do you put those feet down at the bottom of the river?"
59:16;59:19;"Because you can't try out the river."
59:19;59:20;"That's not going to work."
59:20;59:21;"You can't try out the Hudson River."
59:21;59:30;"You need to devise a system to build a stable, giant pillar that goes to the seabed of the Hudson River."
59:30;59:33;"I'm sorry, the Brooklyn Bridge would be the East River."
59:33;59:35;"But how do you do that?"
59:35;59:36;"Step one."
59:36;59:38;"You've got to build a moat around that, basically."
59:38;59:40;"And I think that's essentially how you do it."
59:40;59:41;"I've seen that."
59:41;59:45;"Where they build a circular structure."
59:45;59:47;"Like a giant bucket."
59:47;59:49;"And they pump the water out."
59:49;59:50;"So it's a dry circle."
59:50;59:52;"How do you even start with that?"
59:52;59:53;"1870."
59:53;59:56;"You're sending divers down to the bottom?"
59:56;59:58;"How deep is the East River?"
59:58;01:00:02;"You know what my take is of how they built the Brooklyn Bridge in 1870?"
01:00:02;01:00:04;"What's that?"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Ancient aliens."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"Because it just doesn't add up."
01:00:08;01:00:11;"They had to have been helped by aliens."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"Okay, well after you go on Club Random, you're going on Rogan."
01:00:14;01:00:19;"Joe, I'm here to tell you that everything we know about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge is nonsense."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"It doesn't add up."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"[singing]"
01:00:38;01:00:50;"like all things fades and I can recall our caravel a little wicker beetle shell"
01:00:50;01:01:00;"with four fine mouths and lateen sails its bearings on cap harryvale"
01:01:02;01:01:11;"oh my love oh it was a funny little thing all right jay can you introduce our next guest"
01:01:11;01:01:20;"yes our next guest is lance oppenheim a filmmaker a documentarian who uh has the new movie coming out"
01:01:20;01:01:28;"on fx and hulu like i think today the day this is airing well called sperm world it's about people"
01:01:28;01:01:35;"basically ivf fertilization treatment is incredibly expensive so this is about people online who meet"
01:01:35;01:01:47;"each other and exchange uh biological material material to with the hopes of making a child"
01:01:47;01:01:53;"well with a turkey based tupperware we've all seen lance's um was this his first feature"
01:01:53;01:01:58;"doc is some kind of heaven which is a great documentary about um a retirement community"
01:01:58;01:02:03;"called the villages in florida which i think is the biggest retirement community in america"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"yeah that was a movie that came out a few years ago and i loved that movie and actually at the"
01:02:06;01:02:12;"time i remember thinking we should have lance on tc and then he actually reached out to me"
01:02:12;01:02:18;"we had emailed a few times in the previous years and then he reached out to me when sperm world was"
01:02:18;01:02:25;"done and i actually ended up doing a painting for the promotion of the movie it was a weird"
01:02:25;01:02:30;"commission for me i rarely do commissions but explain that what did you paint he gave me a"
01:02:30;01:02:35;"bunch of stills from the movie of people meeting in parking lots with tupperwares full of biological"
01:02:35;01:02:41;"material but he he was really nice about it he said like you know i like your work really impacted"
01:02:41;01:02:47;"how me and the cinematographer shot the film because a lot of the film takes places and like"
01:02:47;01:02:53;"takes place in like parking lots of like you know uh an old sears building or like an old best buy"
01:02:53;01:02:59;"or something so it's definitely up my alley in terms of my own artistic interests yeah and he"
01:02:59;01:03:04;"was just like yeah like your palette and like the tone of your paintings really like impacted the"
01:03:04;01:03:10;"aesthetic of the doc uh which is very flattering and then he was like maybe we can figure out a"
01:03:10;01:03:17;"way that you can like make a painting based on the movie that that fx could use to promote i love that"
01:03:17;01:03:23;"the doc so i made a small painting they're using as part of the promo for the movie it was a fun"
01:03:23;01:03:29;"project i don't usually do that kind of thing yeah love that so i've yeah i've gotten to know lance"
01:03:29;01:03:33;"pretty well over the last few months because we've been back and forth on this a lot"
01:03:34;01:03:42;"and also i have to say we have a tc bombshell that i'm gonna uh unload on you guys wow"
01:03:42;01:03:48;"yep let's get lance oppenheim on the horn now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
01:03:48;01:04:00;"hey lance what's up welcome to time crisis wow lance i was just teeing you up a little bit"
01:04:00;01:04:06;"telling the story about me doing the painting for your for sperm world and we were talking about"
01:04:06;01:04:10;"some kind of heaven and stuff but then i i did say that you have a major time crisis bombshell"
01:04:10;01:04:15;"that i needed to address right at the top i was talking to lance this morning and somehow this"
01:04:15;01:04:27;"came up he's met richard montanus i did oh i did not only that the fire inside uh i believe my uh"
01:04:27;01:04:32;"publicist helped that song get a an oscar nomination uh that's the first thing i heard"
01:04:32;01:04:38;"you got places to go you're not going this"
01:04:38;01:04:48;"low oh no no no no no they will tell you you're crazy they will call you a fool"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"they will think they can stop you but there's no stopping you"
01:04:52;01:05:04;"they can't put out what you got inside you no way to put out that flame nothing can hold you back"
01:05:04;01:05:14;"no one can kill you back when you got the fire inside when you got the fire inside and oh"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"you're gonna own this life"
01:05:17;01:05:23;"cause you got the fire inside cause you got the fire inside"
01:05:23;01:05:41;"i met uh mr i don't think he'll remember me mr montanus he i was in college he came for uh you"
01:05:41;01:05:48;"know kind of a conversation uh about how he did what he did and i was telling jake i'm not sure"
01:05:48;01:05:55;"i kind of part i kind of partially believe it uh he seemed like a very nice guy but you know"
01:05:55;01:06:01;"it was interesting it was half talk half um there was a lot of promotion for the the fact that the"
01:06:01;01:06:06;"movie was about to be made so there was a lot of uh excitement a bunch so you're lance you're pretty"
01:06:06;01:06:12;"young you were in college recently this is like 2018 2018 2019 around there they'd already announced"
01:06:12;01:06:19;"it that they were yes film yes and uh he came to uh i went to harvard so he came to he went there"
01:06:19;01:06:25;"and he gave a speech and i remember there was a lot of um you know it was it was it was a"
01:06:25;01:06:29;"motivational talk right before this this that this happened this uh it was kind of a nice"
01:06:29;01:06:35;"palate cleanser in a way because there was a guy the speaker before him in the same auditorium at"
01:06:35;01:06:41;"sanders hall there was a guy who was uh talking preaching about getting his um you know like uh"
01:06:41;01:06:48;"surgically reattaching uh his foreskin and he was he was forcibly removed from sanders hall for uh"
01:06:48;01:06:53;"for for doing so there was just like this massive and he was the opener for richard montanus creator"
01:06:53;01:06:59;"of hot cheetos what the hell is going on not the opener it was this was like uh several months"
01:06:59;01:07:04;"before it was called i said uh sex and circumcision an american love story and i remember there's that"
01:07:04;01:07:10;"you know this was like uh there was a lot of controversy like how did this guy uh who who"
01:07:10;01:07:15;"seemingly um you know had maybe i thought it was pretty interesting but a lot of people felt like"
01:07:15;01:07:21;"it was offensive and insulting so the question was how did this guy hijack you know this really big"
01:07:21;01:07:27;"auditorium and so anyway that happened and then uh like a few months later richard uh you know"
01:07:27;01:07:32;"came and how are these talks promoted is this mandatory or is this just for students who are"
01:07:32;01:07:39;"studying kind of um corn-based uh snack products yeah it's uh it's they force you to show up they"
01:07:39;01:07:44;"bribe you with tons of um different cheetos and different things and if you don't go"
01:07:44;01:07:50;"they will assassinate you no they uh it was you know it's a sign up kind of optional you get to"
01:07:50;01:07:56;"go if you uh so you're just a college student you said you want to meet the guy who who claims to"
01:07:56;01:08:01;"have invented flaming hot cheetos and yeah yeah sure sign me up yeah i shook his hands i didn't"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"really have much of a conversation i just kind of thought that the whole thing was interesting"
01:08:05;01:08:09;"um you know and he this was a few yeah i don't know if he still does this i imagine he does"
01:08:09;01:08:16;"but you know i did uh it crossed your mind to ask him if if he wanted to do a documentary with you"
01:08:16;01:08:22;"i honestly should have thought about that but you know they already i already kind of figured this"
01:08:22;01:08:28;"guy was uh he he he had his movie that was he was promoting and then i guess two years after that"
01:08:28;01:08:35;"there was the whole um controversy and uh i i you know i wasn't surprised whichever way it turned"
01:08:35;01:08:39;"you you were saying that you you were pretty skeptical of his story i will say i think it"
01:08:39;01:08:46;"still would be pretty cool to do and and time crisis we've talked about uh getting into the"
01:08:46;01:08:52;"documentary producing business we might have to ask you a few questions but we could commission"
01:08:52;01:08:59;"you to do okay you see you've seen flaming hot you've listened to the fire inside you've maybe"
01:08:59;01:09:04;"maybe read richard montaigne's book but how about we make a documentary that tells the whole story"
01:09:04;01:09:10;"about the whole thing the making of the movie the real richard montaigne's story you interview the"
01:09:10;01:09:15;"guy at the la times who tried to take him down we'll get president biden on the horn why didn't"
01:09:15;01:09:20;"you invite montaigne's to the white house presidential screening of flaming hot you can"
01:09:21;01:09:27;"interview ava longoria everybody involved in the whole story that's what the world needs and you"
01:09:27;01:09:31;"seem like an even-handed guy and i think the fact that you and montaigne's have some history"
01:09:31;01:09:36;"would probably help you sell him on the fact that listen i'm not the la times guy i have no interest"
01:09:36;01:09:41;"in taking you down i think this might be an interesting complicated story about ownership"
01:09:41;01:09:48;"the birth of hispanic marketing um in the gringo world all that kind of like you know what i mean"
01:09:48;01:09:52;"like a i mean to be fair this is going to take the next 10 years of your life but but this is going to"
01:09:52;01:09:58;"be something where you look at it from all angles and that's what the tc community needs i think i"
01:09:58;01:10:05;"have you covered man because i am ready i think my whole my whole career has led to this point"
01:10:05;01:10:10;"i've i've been waiting for this opportunity it's interesting you know i'm curious did was he um"
01:10:10;01:10:16;"was was he on set when they made the you know movie was he was he there that's so crazy i feel"
01:10:16;01:10:21;"like they were in the does have a cameo in it oh yeah he's a cameo he has a camera when they're"
01:10:21;01:10:25;"giving out um flaming hot cheetos at the park was he consulting because you know sometimes i'm curious"
01:10:25;01:10:30;"about that i i um do you guys know this filmmaker ross mcElwee he made this movie called sherman's"
01:10:30;01:10:37;"march a long time ago yes he uh there was a film that was uh in in the works for a while that was"
01:10:37;01:10:43;"uh basically about um hollywood's attempts to remake that movie and he agreed to let them"
01:10:43;01:10:50;"you know pursue it if uh if he let if they let him film all the make the behind the scenes stuff"
01:10:50;01:10:55;"the making of and so he was interviewing people that were pretending you know to be him were"
01:10:55;01:11:01;"women you know the premise of that movie you know he's he's going and meeting women you know"
01:11:01;01:11:07;"ex-girlfriends as he's trying to figure out uh some sort of link between his life and general sherman"
01:11:07;01:11:12;"um but anyway yeah i'm always curious about that how does uh how does someone feel when they the"
01:11:12;01:11:19;"movie about you know ostensibly about their lives is being made and the creative liberties that are"
01:11:19;01:11:24;"taken you know i bet he probably felt pretty good about the movie i'm sure he felt weird about not"
01:11:24;01:11:29;"getting invited to the white house screening and this is this is what we got to find out"
01:11:29;01:11:35;"what happened in in that period when the la times coming after him and the the movie"
01:11:36;01:11:43;"had it's it's a real crazy confluence of events but your new feature is called sperm world"
01:11:43;01:11:51;"and so yours is inspired is it fair to say based on a new york times article called the sperm kings"
01:11:51;01:11:57;"have a problem too much demand and so this documentary is produced by the new york times"
01:11:57;01:12:03;"what does that mean well it means that um richard montanez was uh was running the show all along"
01:12:03;01:12:11;"because uh he is he's left behind his old life and now he works at the new york times i wish that"
01:12:11;01:12:16;"would be cool right if i can work with him he commissioned him he commissioned the movie this"
01:12:16;01:12:23;"is sort of a sort of aspirational sequel to to uh you know his book no i don't know you know"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"it's interesting the uh it's it's i've made a lot of films with the new york times that's kind of"
01:12:27;01:12:32;"where i started um you know they used to do this thing and they still do called the op docs which"
01:12:32;01:12:38;"is it's like opinion op-eds documentaries you know and so independent filmmakers you know would uh"
01:12:38;01:12:44;"they they uh you make these movies and you uh you try and hopeful hope for the you know and"
01:12:44;01:12:47;"outlets to pick it up and get it out there and so that's what i started doing i used to"
01:12:47;01:12:53;"spam email them because i was hoping that they would um you know take take my stuff and then i"
01:12:53;01:12:58;"got to know the people there and one of the executives kind of advanced and runs the tv"
01:12:58;01:13:02;"and movie division it's interesting though you know i mean the movies i make i'm not like a"
01:13:02;01:13:07;"journalist right and and um i i've always sort of subscribed more to the idea that like non-fiction"
01:13:07;01:13:12;"storytelling not just filmmaking it's like a it's about you know the creative treatments"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"of reality which probably you know if you're looking back at your your friend richard it's"
01:13:16;01:13:22;"probably a good uh his book is he's probably treating it the same way and uh even the movie"
01:13:22;01:13:27;"even though it's not non-fiction i'm taking this very seriously here you know trying to draw these"
01:13:27;01:13:34;"links to be fair the i'm sure for richard montanez and after that we we can talk about your new movie"
01:13:34;01:13:41;"we gotta get the origins of the flame but obviously this is a phrase jake uses a lot"
01:13:41;01:13:48;"i don't know where who kind of popularized it but is emotional truth obviously richard montanez"
01:13:48;01:13:55;"one thing we know for sure about him is that he went from being a janitor at frito-lay to being"
01:13:55;01:14:03;"a high-level marketing executive we know that's true did he do it because he and he alone invented"
01:14:03;01:14:09;"flame and hot cheetos that's what's being called into question no matter what he did something"
01:14:09;01:14:17;"pretty remarkable especially for a guy from his background at that time so did he embellish"
01:14:18;01:14:28;"a very real story of personal triumph because you know he bent reality a little bit to fit something"
01:14:28;01:14:35;"very real to fit an emotional truth to fit an emotional truth which is did i play a gigantic"
01:14:35;01:14:44;"role in getting frito-lay a gringo company to make products for the community that i come from"
01:14:44;01:14:52;"he did now did he do that through a million paper cuts by little by little saying you know i think"
01:14:52;01:14:56;"it might be nice if you marketed this product this way or i think you're missing out you know"
01:14:56;01:15:01;"was it like that that's a hard story to tell so maybe just say i invented flame and hot cheetos"
01:15:01;01:15:08;"yeah and maybe the truth is somewhere in between you know because that's why we need this dot"
01:15:08;01:15:14;"that's we'll we'll find the answers one way maybe if you watch uh the movie sperm worlds there's"
01:15:14;01:15:19;"yeah there's a subliminal truths that can come to you i just hope one day 10 years from now"
01:15:19;01:15:27;"when this 20 part series is done you're sitting with um bill maher on club random and he's looking"
01:15:27;01:15:34;"at his notes and he says produced by time crisis what does that mean okay so tell us about sperm"
01:15:34;01:15:39;"world yeah well you know look i i um it's interesting i i feel like the difference"
01:15:39;01:15:43;"between time crisis producing a documentary and then your times producing documentary i mean if"
01:15:43;01:15:49;"you uh you know it doesn't it doesn't take that much these days to produce something except for"
01:15:49;01:15:55;"being a very you know emotionally available to a neurotic filmmaker maybe and uh you know being"
01:15:55;01:16:02;"able to we pay for your gas and get you the chipotle gift card yes well ideally a subway"
01:16:02;01:16:07;"gift cards because that's okay that's or you know taco bell preferably is another place i like to"
01:16:07;01:16:12;"eat when i'm shooting late in the night but you know this yeah this is a movie i i got to know"
01:16:12;01:16:19;"this reporter nelly bulls she wrote this article and i made another movie my first feature-length"
01:16:19;01:16:23;"film i made with the new york times and they were sort of tangentially involved but they gave you"
01:16:23;01:16:28;"know a lot of um uh kind of early money because i thought it was going to be a short documentary"
01:16:28;01:16:34;"and then it kind of became something bigger and longer um and this one in this case i'm new a"
01:16:34;01:16:40;"journalist she sent me this sort of uh the world she she showed me this whole universe of people"
01:16:41;01:16:47;"finding each other on these you know facebook groups and these people were meeting on these"
01:16:47;01:16:54;"groups for sperm there were men that were advertising their services for uh little to no"
01:16:54;01:16:59;"money you know these were completely all this stuff was unregulated people meeting outside"
01:16:59;01:17:04;"of sperm banks you had women that had tried to go to a sperm bank and maybe it didn't work for"
01:17:04;01:17:11;"some reason or you know maybe they're they they opted uh intentionally to go on these facebook"
01:17:11;01:17:17;"groups to meet meet their donor and uh i just kind of i started looking at these posts and i just was"
01:17:17;01:17:24;"like what a fascinating blend of things going on you have people women that are posting these like"
01:17:24;01:17:30;"really emotional really intimate stories about their trials and tribulations to having a child"
01:17:30;01:17:35;"and then you have a guy that's you know responding by giving a thumbs up and then uh commenting i'm"
01:17:35;01:17:42;"available you know and then that was it they meet up they uh in a motel room somewhere how does it"
01:17:42;01:17:49;"work is there any blueprint for this no so you know for me i just was like okay as a filmmaker i'd love"
01:17:49;01:17:57;"to just understand uh first off just be be like uh with these people while they're making these"
01:17:57;01:18:04;"choices and kind of uh fumbling towards this this common desire of having a child and then it kind"
01:18:04;01:18:09;"of you know turned into something else from there and so the people who who are meeting in parking"
01:18:09;01:18:18;"lots with sperm donors they could be anybody they could be uh an infertile couple uh a single women"
01:18:18;01:18:25;"couples where nobody produces sperm like is it anything under the sun or is there like a typical"
01:18:25;01:18:32;"profile for the the sperm recipient no it can be kind of anything i mean that i um i would say it's"
01:18:32;01:18:38;"mostly you know queer women that are in like same-sex relationships but there's transgender"
01:18:38;01:18:43;"folks there's yeah like you're saying infertile dudes but you know in the case of the film it i"
01:18:43;01:18:51;"ended up sort of focusing on there's two women that are in the movie uh one of them is has cystic"
01:18:51;01:18:57;"fibrosis and then you know she's it's basically um in some ways kind of a death wish where the"
01:18:57;01:19:03;"only thing that's giving her life is the desire to be pregnant right and so she's she's pursuing"
01:19:03;01:19:08;"that uh even though everyone in her life is saying don't do it and so she's kind of created this very"
01:19:08;01:19:13;"lonely existence where you know she has a few friends but for the most part the only person"
01:19:13;01:19:20;"that becomes relatively close to her in this kind of ambiguously defined relationship is her sperm"
01:19:20;01:19:25;"donor who's like three times her age but you know that's really i don't know to me the movie ended"
01:19:25;01:19:30;"up becoming something that's much more about like um it's like this kind of existential"
01:19:30;01:19:35;"you know road movie or something where it's about people that are just trying to"
01:19:35;01:19:43;"figure out why they're on earth what is it that they're here to do you know what gives them"
01:19:43;01:19:50;"meaning in their lives"
01:19:50;01:20:04;"because i've heard so much about"
01:20:04;01:20:11;"it"
01:20:11;01:20:26;"i think a lot of these people you know don't really know they found themselves in a point"
01:20:26;01:20:31;"in their lives where they're whatever they were doing before they started sperm donating or before"
01:20:31;01:20:37;"they started trying to have a child uh kind of led them to this place this this this asterisk mark or"
01:20:37;01:20:41;"question mark where they didn't they didn't know where things were going and so that's kind of the"
01:20:41;01:20:47;"that's where we find them we find them at this kind of crossroads and it's all done in an incredibly"
01:20:47;01:20:55;"strong visual style that's very beautiful like my plants saw lance's first film i was immediately"
01:20:55;01:21:00;"struck by that and it continued it with this one where it's just like it's unusually beautiful for"
01:21:00;01:21:09;"a documentary it's very cinematic very filmic um so i think that adds like a real kind of emotional"
01:21:09;01:21:15;"anchor to the whole thing well thanks well it's funny you know i told this to jake the first time"
01:21:15;01:21:22;"i i uh i emailed him but so much of the movie the aesthetic and you know the the places where people"
01:21:22;01:21:28;"were meeting one another they all kind of i i was looking at his paintings like all the time you know"
01:21:28;01:21:34;"i was obsessed with the hooters and one that the empty choice or us because a lot of these places"
01:21:34;01:21:41;"that people were meeting each other were like um places that long strethy and vistas hey boom done"
01:21:41;01:21:45;"that's uh i should have put that in the first email i wrote to jake but yeah they were i mean really"
01:21:45;01:21:51;"it was sort of like um these places that look totally uh familiar uh by day and then you know"
01:21:51;01:22:00;"by sunset and by night they just become uh totally foreign and alien and uh yeah it's a yeah it's a"
01:22:00;01:22:06;"beautiful movie um the thing that really like like the question i had after watching this thing was"
01:22:06;01:22:12;"not so much the women i understood their their impulses it was the guys the donors that were like"
01:22:12;01:22:20;"those guys were just complete kind of black holes of like of mystery to me i was like what is what"
01:22:20;01:22:25;"what is driving these god these men well it's funny because some people you know there's a"
01:22:25;01:22:31;"school of thought where people think everything all human society is just driven by these like"
01:22:31;01:22:37;"evolutionary impulses yeah and you know how many times you heard somebody talk about someone"
01:22:37;01:22:44;"spreading their seed just that male that male impulse to spread their seed like five percent"
01:22:44;01:22:49;"of the world is the descendants of gangas khan gangas khan right yeah it's interesting you know"
01:22:49;01:22:54;"i feel like in a way it's like these the men in the movie i think uh there's a part of them that"
01:22:54;01:22:59;"has that uh that have that idea in the back of their minds but i i do think it's a lot deeper"
01:22:59;01:23:05;"than that and a lot more emotionally complicated i think it's almost this like um you know it"
01:23:05;01:23:11;"reminds me a lot of like you ever see bringing out the dead the scorsese nicholas cage movie where"
01:23:11;01:23:16;"cage plays again movie so good right it's amazing flick all takes place at night just like freaky"
01:23:16;01:23:22;"new york hospital paramedic world it's like in hell's kitchen yeah and the guys in that movie"
01:23:22;01:23:28;"or you know cage in that movie it's like it's it's this almost selfish desire he's like i must"
01:23:28;01:23:33;"save someone's life not because i'm saving their lives but because i need that feeling i need that"
01:23:33;01:23:39;"i i need that uh that rush that purpose and so i think you know for most of these guys i mean"
01:23:39;01:23:44;"there's a there's you know there's a guy who's who's in the movie who's like in his mid-60s"
01:23:44;01:23:49;"and he's divorced and he's beginning you know we're meeting him at the the start of this of his"
01:23:49;01:23:56;"hobby that becomes a lot more maybe integral to his his personality his life and there's a guy"
01:23:56;01:24:02;"who's sort of in his like mid-career level you know as a form as a donor you know he charges a"
01:24:02;01:24:07;"little bit but not that much and then there's a guy who's trying to quit um but he's been you know"
01:24:07;01:24:14;"doing it for a while and he has like 170 children is that ari that's ari yeah and so you know there's"
01:24:14;01:24:20;"there's like these three tiers of uh of people doing this and i think it's it's like uh in a way"
01:24:20;01:24:26;"they're all longing for something it's not quite and i think it's like this completely unrequited"
01:24:26;01:24:31;"feeling and you see it you see it in the groups because in these facebook groups you see it all"
01:24:31;01:24:36;"the time you see the women they come in they either get pregnant they leave or they don't"
01:24:36;01:24:42;"and they still leave and the men kind of remain there fulfilling other people's desires but kind"
01:24:42;01:24:50;"of remaining in this sort of purgatorial like you know limbo neutral gear universe um yeah yeah no"
01:24:50;01:24:56;"i i do it's really cool like for a doc to be so ambiguous you're really like on the ride with"
01:24:56;01:25:02;"these guys and and it's uh but there's yeah there are no clear answers on what drives these guys"
01:25:02;01:25:08;"i mean the ari character like you were saying he's in this like weird limbo state like he'll go and"
01:25:08;01:25:15;"visit this is one scene that i always think about he goes and visits some of his kids you know that"
01:25:15;01:25:22;"he sees once a year and then like the final shot of that sequence is like him just like bunking down"
01:25:22;01:25:28;"for the night on like the family's couch it's just like oh yeah i mean you know it's just so weird"
01:25:28;01:25:33;"like daddy's here and then like and then he like leaves the next day and goes sees like another"
01:25:33;01:25:39;"family he co-created yeah i mean he lives his life it's like warren beattie and shampoo you know"
01:25:39;01:25:44;"that's that's the thing that kind of drew me to him where he's just uh it's like this uh merry-go-round"
01:25:44;01:25:50;"he doesn't have a home really he teaches math at a community college in new york but he's been"
01:25:50;01:25:56;"sued so many times for child support and he's garnered so much of his wages that uh he he uh"
01:25:56;01:26:04;"you know oh by people who ostensibly just wanted his sperm and then they'd sue yes yes oh boy and"
01:26:04;01:26:10;"so you know he doesn't uh he claims he doesn't have enough resources to really get his own place"
01:26:10;01:26:15;"so what ends up happening is he just kind of you know but it's also a choice like he uh what ends"
01:26:15;01:26:20;"up happening is he goes and he spends every night at a new you know different child's house and so"
01:26:20;01:26:27;"and he has 170 something of them now so it's like uh he seems driven like tortured by a compulsion"
01:26:27;01:26:33;"yeah the compulsion is i think uh like um he seems loving and being loved i really do think it's like"
01:26:33;01:26:40;"uh he's a good heart is a you know he's but he um it's he he identifies as a father to these kids"
01:26:40;01:26:45;"even though he uh could never be a father to be a father to that many yeah well yeah and and that"
01:26:45;01:26:50;"the the desire to love and be loved i've been thinking as we're talking it's such an interesting"
01:26:50;01:26:56;"time for this movie because i feel like very often i hear people talking about the fact that"
01:26:56;01:27:03;"more people than ever say they don't want to have kids the birth rate is down you find more people"
01:27:03;01:27:11;"you know marriage is down um and you also people talking about the loneliness epidemic"
01:27:11;01:27:16;"in the western world so it's an interesting confluence of events where people have moved"
01:27:16;01:27:22;"away from um some of the dominant norms which maybe put a lot of people into unfulfilling"
01:27:22;01:27:26;"positions being married to somebody you don't want to be married to having kids when you don't want"
01:27:26;01:27:34;"to have kids and yet we're in this kind of limbo now where people have to as some of those traditional"
01:27:34;01:27:41;"structures uh fall away get loosened up now people have to kind of figure out this world and"
01:27:41;01:27:47;"everything you're saying kind of seems related to that people figuring out yeah how do you love and"
01:27:47;01:27:54;"be loved how do you connect how do you have a relationship with the next generation if you're"
01:27:54;01:27:58;"you know teaching math at a community college and ostensibly a single person there's always"
01:27:58;01:28:02;"been people who've had to figure out that they don't fit into the traditional family world but"
01:28:02;01:28:08;"maybe we have more people than ever in america you know forging new paths hey amen to all those"
01:28:08;01:28:14;"things i do think that's um you know yeah i think i think we're all fundamentally uh you know i i"
01:28:14;01:28:20;"like to believe at least myself i i i get very lonely very easily and you know i think when you"
01:28:20;01:28:26;"make a movie especially something like this and it takes you know really uh several years to to"
01:28:26;01:28:32;"make and you're with these people that um generally really want to be seen in a way you know i think"
01:28:32;01:28:36;"that's in some cases what led them to the groups in the first place these facebook groups where"
01:28:36;01:28:42;"they're advertising themselves as like i'm worthy of replication choose me you know please i'll do"
01:28:42;01:28:49;"it for free even it's like this really um i i want to connect with you please just let me connect"
01:28:49;01:28:54;"with you and that's this longing is uh it's it's so it's so readily apparent and so that's like"
01:28:54;01:29:01;"the challenge i think of making a film about it is it's also called sperm world although i i i i've"
01:29:01;01:29:06;"always you know i wanted the title to be something a little little fun you know kind of like a good"
01:29:06;01:29:12;"pop song you know it's like uh there's a catchy a song by the the or something where it's like"
01:29:12;01:29:16;"really nice you want to dance to it but it's really sad actually when you listen to it"
01:29:16;01:29:21;"well i didn't wake up this morning cause you didn't go to bed you were watching the whites"
01:29:21;01:29:32;"of your eyes the candle on your wall is ticking the days off you've been reading some old letters"
01:29:32;01:29:43;"you smile and think how much you've changed all the money in the world couldn't buy back those days"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"you watch your pain"
01:29:53;01:30:17;"well i gotta say i i think it's amazing that jake's work inspired your film and that jake"
01:30:17;01:30:23;"was commissioned to do a painting but if you had asked me to write a song called sperm world"
01:30:23;01:30:31;"i think we might all be sitting at the oscars next year oh i would i would be wearing a tuxedo with"
01:30:31;01:30:41;"sequined sperms on the lapel and we would be looking up on that stage and um seeing uh the"
01:30:41;01:30:48;"weekend sing sperm world an original song for the lance oppenheim film uh written by me well"
01:30:48;01:30:53;"we could have gotten uh what's her face who wrote uh maybe you guys could have co-wrote it together"
01:30:53;01:30:59;"the flint oh diane diane warren i would love to collaborate with her i missed opportunity on my"
01:30:59;01:31:05;"parts okay sperm world sperm world two we should give it i think we should give it to becky g"
01:31:08;01:31:15;"once once again give it back then hey well it's not too late man we could always reopen the movie"
01:31:15;01:31:23;"you know and just uh you know yeah becky g as we could give the time crisis family a producer"
01:31:23;01:31:29;"credits if uh you know if you're willing to produce by the new york times and you know time"
01:31:29;01:31:34;"crisis i do or maybe this is this has like a full adaptation of the silver screen maybe this is like"
01:31:34;01:31:40;"a harmony corinne or an alexander payne movie in like three years oh yeah fictionalized version"
01:31:40;01:31:44;"right yeah you make the doc and then i think we could still call it the flame inside"
01:31:44;01:31:51;"or the fire inside or the fire inside i think we call the fire inside what a great title yeah"
01:31:51;01:31:59;"it's got the fire inside from the feature film sperm world there we go and see if we can just"
01:31:59;01:32:04;"every year you should try and uh recruit new artists to you know with a new song but just"
01:32:04;01:32:11;"call it the same same title the fire inside the most nominated title in oscar history"
01:32:11;01:32:17;"this would be a sick mike judge movie too oh i love that oh yeah hey well you know early on"
01:32:17;01:32:25;"there was a time where uh alec berg you know that he's such a talented guy he he co-created that show"
01:32:25;01:32:30;"barry and oh right valley i was he was supposed to work on this uh we were supposed to do this"
01:32:30;01:32:37;"together but it got kind of complicated with uh uh setting up the movie you know a lot but uh"
01:32:37;01:32:44;"anyway hey all those people big fans and you know i look for me it's like as a documentarian i don't"
01:32:44;01:32:48;"know i'm like i don't really see myself in some ways it's like i'm trying and you'll see it in"
01:32:48;01:32:54;"the movie it's like i'm trying to adapt everything in it is real even though it's shot in this really"
01:32:54;01:33:01;"uh like heightened kind of stylized way but it's almost like i'm adapting like real experiences"
01:33:01;01:33:07;"in you know real life in real time with people and they're almost like performing or playing"
01:33:07;01:33:12;"themselves in the movie it's kind of sounds pretentious i guess when i say it but it's"
01:33:12;01:33:18;"you'll see it it's sort of this like feeling i'm trying to i'm trying to inhabit this subjectivity"
01:33:18;01:33:23;"that they feel like i've interviewed these people that's how it works for hours on end you know and"
01:33:23;01:33:28;"i understand what they're feeling and their desires and the obstacles that aren't letting"
01:33:28;01:33:36;"them express that and it's sort of like how do i use all this all the cinematic tools that we have"
01:33:36;01:33:43;"at our you know disposal to basically uh show that to inhabit that fantasy with them or to inhabit"
01:33:43;01:33:48;"that subjectivity and so in that sense it doesn't really feel like a documentary it feels like"
01:33:48;01:33:53;"you're watching a fiction film that's what's so unique about your work lance i don't i can't really"
01:33:53;01:34:00;"put my finger on it because it doesn't come off as contrived or even really excessively stylized"
01:34:00;01:34:06;"it comes off as very naturalistic and not real totally but even yeah just like heaven i know"
01:34:06;01:34:11;"what you mean yeah that had that quality of it's like they're all like kind of like a string of"
01:34:11;01:34:19;"like perfect photographs or something um it's very unusual so hats off to you man hey well thank you"
01:34:19;01:34:24;"well done and also thanks everybody's been listening all this time the best place to watch"
01:34:24;01:34:32;"sperm world is on fx on tv or or stream it on hulu yes yeah you know and if you're if you're a time"

01:34:46;01:34:51;"yeah yeah begging their parents to watch sperm world well you know i guess it's got some stuff"
01:34:51;01:34:57;"in there it's got that uh you know the the stork idea right that's what everyone tells"
01:34:57;01:35:01;"their their kids i don't know if you guys tell your children you know about uh that's where babies"
01:35:01;01:35:06;"are made they they're dropped from the sky from birds but um i know i wouldn't if my if my son"

01:35:13;01:35:18;"he says what is that i say i do not care to speak on that any further maybe in about seven years when"
01:35:18;01:35:23;"you have your own hulu account you'll know what i'm talking about yeah it's instructional that's"
01:35:23;01:35:28;"good i'm glad to be of service okay here's here's a unrelated question but this is serious so like"
01:35:28;01:35:33;"i want you to just you're obviously a very intelligent guy you went to one of america's"
01:35:33;01:35:40;"finest schools you met with montaigne's okay if we tell you you have unlimited resources and"
01:35:40;01:35:48;"unlimited manpower all you need to do is you're in charge of this project so you can't go to a"
01:35:48;01:35:55;"a an expert and say oh tell me how to do this but you get everything you need you need uh you know"
01:35:55;01:36:03;"a hundred tons of stone you got it you need uh a thousand men you got it all you need to do"
01:36:03;01:36:10;"and you have all the time you want all you need to do is build the brooklyn bridge how are you"
01:36:10;01:36:15;"doing it which by the way they built in 1870 so think about how much we have today that they didn't"
01:36:15;01:36:20;"have back then how do you start wow well you know it's a that's a great question i actually did have"
01:36:20;01:36:27;"you ever seen the ken burns documentary the brooklyn bridge oh my god no sorry i'm bringing"
01:36:27;01:36:32;"this up wait does that exist no i'm aware of this film don't i didn't know that apologize"
01:36:32;01:36:42;"it's a mother you picked the right guy your your expertise in documentaries might actually save you"
01:36:42;01:36:47;"in this contrived scenario okay go on okay well you know every every night i go to i go to bed"
01:36:47;01:36:53;"and my girlfriend she she puts on one of the you know ken burns movie or she puts on like a you"
01:36:53;01:36:58;"know old uh well yeah it's usually like it's like the dust bowl you know or and but one of them i"
01:36:58;01:37:05;"was riveted by which is the brooklyn bridge and this guy john roebling or john washington roebling"
01:37:05;01:37:11;"so it's like the street in brooklyn roebling yes it was a father-son duo there was a guy the father"
01:37:11;01:37:16;"was an architect i'm not answering your question but there's a two guys i like this architect"
01:37:16;01:37:22;"genius who uh designed it and then he died and his son basically who was like i think in his early"
01:37:22;01:37:26;"30s given the the blueprint and was just like you know it's basically what you're telling me"
01:37:26;01:37:32;"build it you know figure it out and so this and uh he did it he did a great job and i guess what"
01:37:32;01:37:37;"they ended up doing was they um they created these things called casings these like wooden"
01:37:37;01:37:41;"right i knew it had something to do with caissons yes yeah caissons is that the way you say it"
01:37:41;01:37:46;"case on case that's how i've heard it pronounced okay yeah maybe it's case and they put that down"
01:37:46;01:37:50;"in the water right and then these guys i guess i wouldn't know how to okay okay well hold on don't"
01:37:50;01:37:57;"just glad don't don't just bulldoze through that how do they put it down in the water 1870 how do"
01:37:57;01:38:04;"you how do you get that going i honestly uh i do send a guy down to the bottom of the east river"
01:38:04;01:38:09;"you build it you build it on land and then you you drop it in i guess somehow and then you pump and"
01:38:09;01:38:14;"it's so heavy that it goes all the way to the bottom but you know every person who went down"
01:38:14;01:38:20;"there including uh uh john you know washington roebling the the father the son of washington"
01:38:20;01:38:24;"roebling who john roebling i think is his name who built the whole thing he got the bends that's"
01:38:24;01:38:30;"what all those guys got and he basically got so f***** up by the by his work down there that he"
01:38:30;01:38:36;"was um he was hospitalized and then he was immobile for the rest of his life and he lived"
01:38:36;01:38:41;"basically with uh he every day he'd look outside his window uh because he lived really really close"
01:38:41;01:38:47;"to the bridge and he'd watch them build it and his wife was the one who would basically uh he"
01:38:47;01:38:52;"had binoculars he'd look and his wife would be the one at the by the end to really actually build the"
01:38:52;01:38:57;"whole thing because she was going between him and the people and the builders and so i guess if i"
01:38:57;01:39:02;"was to answer your question like if i had everything what would i uh what would i need"
01:39:02;01:39:08;"and i think we start with the case on or case and hey i think it'd be a good partner a life partner"
01:39:08;01:39:14;"love i think i'd need love that's what i'd need that's okay so yeah right great answer lance"
01:39:14;01:39:24;"never enough i just wait for us to go in circles lifetime of giving up for you"
01:40:14;01:40:18;"break now that i've know that you're low-key an expert on the brooklyn bridge due to your"
01:40:18;01:40:26;"background and documentaries do you think if we gave you 10 years and you and your girlfriend"
01:40:26;01:40:31;"with unlimited manpower and and um supplies could build the brooklyn bridge do you remember"
01:40:31;01:40:37;"enough from the documentary that you think you could get it going no uh but i think it wouldn't"
01:40:37;01:40:41;"be for lack of trying i would be like i think they had some of those pieces i mean the irony"
01:40:41;01:40:46;"look is that uh you know i don't even think that's the thing that's just so crazy about the brooklyn"
01:40:46;01:40:51;"bridge is that i think if they were to build that or try to build it right now it would take them"
01:40:51;01:40:57;"like five times the amount of time it took those guys yeah it took them i think 13 years"
01:40:57;01:41:02;"unbelievable you know in china they do that [ __ ] overnight it's uh it's right if you want to watch"
01:41:02;01:41:08;"some interesting youtube videos this is another thing my uh abby my girlfriend got me hooked on"
01:41:08;01:41:13;"there's all these uh strange kind of um pro machine you know youtube videos that seems like"
01:41:13;01:41:19;"maybe they were made by uh well they're made by humans the videos but there's a voiceover and"
01:41:19;01:41:24;"they're talking about uh you know it's uh there's no humans in this factory it's just machines"
01:41:24;01:41:28;"and it's like a cool like uh and you know energetic music and it just shows the power"
01:41:28;01:41:34;"of the machine as it builds this like massive you know ocean liner um so i guess maybe that's"
01:41:34;01:41:40;"the answer is just like no humans you know i always thought another movie you ever see"
01:41:40;01:41:47;"american factory i always thought the ending of that was oh yeah so awesome pretty pretty uh"
01:41:47;01:41:52;"depressing ending but they were like yeah all these workers they're all whining all the time"
01:41:52;01:42:00;"we're just gonna replace them and um that's what happens who knows we need like a w a wpa type"
01:42:00;01:42:07;"thing that what i'd love to see there's so many people out of work these days and beyond that as"
01:42:07;01:42:14;"maybe you touch on in your work people just looking for love and meaning i think we need a new wpa"
01:42:14;01:42:25;"where all over america in all 50 states we just get aimless young people building the brooklyn"
01:42:25;01:42:31;"bridge i want to see a brooklyn bridge in in the across every body of water we can think of"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"i i think we could get millions of young americans building the brooklyn bridge"
01:42:35;01:42:42;"from alaska to wisconsin to florida i think there's something to it and i think the challenge"
01:42:42;01:42:49;"of saying well those guys did it in 1870 in 13 years can you beat it can you do it in nine years"
01:42:49;01:42:53;"i just think it could motivate an entire generation but what you know what people don't"
01:42:53;01:42:57;"know what they're here for and a lot of people probably were put on this earth to build the"
01:42:57;01:43:02;"brooklyn bridge but they already built it yeah you know what i mean well that's why probably"
01:43:02;01:43:08;"you know in a place where like uh you know yeah the the china or something it's like the the people"
01:43:08;01:43:14;"that are there they're so um galvanized to work on these public product maybe not public private"
01:43:14;01:43:20;"projects too i think that question of like um you know what am i here for what's what's going on"
01:43:20;01:43:24;"you know it seems like those guys in those videos i watch they're not questioning that at all it"
01:43:24;01:43:30;"seems like they they know exactly what you're saying the project go for it i don't know you"
01:43:30;01:43:35;"know i don't know how you guys feel when you when you finish uh you know i've asked jake this when"
01:43:35;01:43:40;"he finishes a painting or you know nick when you're finishing your you know show or you know"
01:43:40;01:43:45;"as we finish an album yeah you finish an episode of this podcast it's like you there's a profound"
01:43:45;01:43:52;"sense of uh uh just nothing grief that i feel you know it's like i i love this film i made so much"
01:43:52;01:43:59;"and i it's it's but it was so stressful to make and uh now that it's done i don't feel any uh"
01:43:59;01:44:06;"sense of pleasure i just feel um just kind of nothing and sad really because i love the people"
01:44:06;01:44:11;"in the movie and i loved making it but um i probably should have enjoyed it more while i did"
01:44:11;01:44:17;"it right i guess in your line of work you got to say goodbye to to your co-workers you're not going"
01:44:17;01:44:24;"to be meeting them for a game of tennis or a coffee at starbucks anytime well depends i work"
01:44:24;01:44:28;"with the same people i mean i have another project that's gonna hey i hope you guys watch it it's"
01:44:28;01:44:34;"called renfair and it comes out on hbo later i've been i've been hearing about this from eli bush"

01:44:40;01:44:45;"was the first vampire weekend fan wow wow that's cool yeah he's he's great he's been saying it's"
01:44:45;01:44:51;"amazing and so this is another forthcoming tv show that's about a renaissance fair in texas"
01:44:51;01:44:57;"yes yes it's like a it's like a succession story that takes place there so you know a lot of the"
01:44:57;01:45:03;"people that i worked with on uh sperm world also worked on that one and i just try to keep this and"
01:45:03;01:45:08;"most of them are like my friends from college and you know friends from other places too so it's"
01:45:08;01:45:14;"nice it's like a it's kind of like a band of collaborators and we've been making films together"
01:45:14;01:45:18;"for a while now oh really yeah it's like it's the people like you're saying though it's the people"
01:45:18;01:45:22;"that are in the movie that you know you get so close i feel like when someone opens up to you"
01:45:22;01:45:27;"and you know they're vulnerable with you and you're vulnerable with them it's like impossible to not"
01:45:27;01:45:34;"you know you kind of you do fall in love with them in a way and so how do you keep that uh alive"
01:45:34;01:45:38;"when when you're not forced to be with each other because you're making something together that's the"
01:45:38;01:45:45;"hey the the the billion dollar question right i can see well i think what i said to you when you're"
01:45:45;01:45:50;"talking about feeling empty and and nothing after you completed this major project was trying to"
01:45:50;01:45:58;"keep in mind it's the journey not the destination it's the work it's the process uh you know as"
01:45:58;01:46:03;"we're like now the your new record's done it's like are you you know it's was it the making of"
01:46:03;01:46:08;"it that was rewarding or is it like kicking back and being like oh i made a great record i feel so"
01:46:08;01:46:14;"proud of myself it's like it's both i mean as it's been reported in the press recently my passion in"
01:46:14;01:46:22;"life is chilling and and i really i really mean that i love kicking back and i've all i've only"
01:46:22;01:46:27;"gotten better at it as i've gotten older you're very good at chilling i used to get more antsy"
01:46:27;01:46:33;"oh what am i doing am i not keeping up with the the other people am i not you know fulfilling"
01:46:33;01:46:38;"my potential or whatever now i've gotten better and better at it so when i'm done with a project"
01:46:38;01:46:43;"i feel a sense of relief and the people i work with i see all the time so there's also yeah i"
01:46:43;01:46:48;"don't i don't have to i understand what you're talking about lance and that seems like real like"
01:46:48;01:46:54;"i finish an album i'll probably like crel ct bay all these people i'll see them like next week you"
01:46:54;01:46:59;"know it's not some big dramatic thing and then we got the tour after the album then after that we'll"
01:46:59;01:47:06;"go back so if anything i'm i enjoy the free time when the big project's done just to relax a little"
01:47:06;01:47:12;"bit and hang with the family so i don't yeah i don't really feel empty and and i know this is"
01:47:12;01:47:17;"corny and this would be a longer conversation but also as i've gotten older i know me and nick have"
01:47:17;01:47:24;"talked about this but and i think me and you jake but you know i also really believe that the truest"
01:47:24;01:47:31;"form of art is just living well you know vibing whatever that means you know following your path"
01:47:31;01:47:38;"and like i do think eventually there's a way where anybody who's an artist and you guys are obviously"
01:47:38;01:47:46;"artists anybody who has an artistic guy you know eventually you'll figure out how you just apply"
01:47:46;01:47:52;"that to to just the day-to-day and not in a way where where you have to put it on film or on canvas"
01:47:52;01:47:57;"or on wax or whatever your medium is that's definitely something i've noticed more and more"
01:47:57;01:48:01;"i'm like i know a lot of great artists i've been lucky to know great artists in my life"
01:48:01;01:48:05;"and i increasingly look at some of the people i've known in life who never really became"
01:48:05;01:48:09;"professional artists but just like know how to live and i consider them great artists as well"
01:48:09;01:48:15;"you know like like it's all heading to the same place you can organize the images you see in a"
01:48:15;01:48:21;"documentary or an album or a painting and that's great and we have and we have to do it because we"
01:48:21;01:48:28;"love it but also there's people who just organize life in their in their mind too yeah you know what"
