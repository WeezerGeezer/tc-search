00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis, back again. Jake and I reunite in Los Angeles and boy do we have a lot to cover."
00:08;00:14;"Finally, there's news on the Flame and Hot Cheetos movie, the story of Richard Montanez."
00:14;00:23;"All this, plus S.O.D. installation and the top hits of 1992, a very special year."
00:23;00:33;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"They were a threat to our belief, of my rightful chances"
00:47;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:02;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:17;"We were only there"
01:17;01:23;"Time Crisis back once again. A little bit stuffy. You think my voice sounds weird?"
01:23;01:27;"Post tour? I guess you're on tour, sort of."
01:27;01:32;"Yeah, well, it's funny, that's a question I get a lot, people are like, ""Oh is the tour over?"""
01:32;01:38;"Or like, ""Are you on tour?"" and it's like, ""Man, this is the show that never ends."""
01:38;01:41;"What is it? ""Welcome Back My Friend""?"
01:41;01:45;"Welcome back my friend, to the show that never ends"
01:45;01:48;"I should have said ""Welcome Back My Friend, to the show that never ends."""
01:48;01:50;"Wait, who is that?"
01:50;01:52;"ELO? No, no, no, ELP."
01:52;01:57;"Good call, yeah, definitely not ELO. That's like the big ELP hit."
01:57;02:01;"Along with ""Ooooh, what a lucky man"""
02:01;02:03;"Great song. Yeah, lucky man's song."
02:03;02:06;"Wee do do wee do do wee do do"
02:06;02:09;"That was a classic Q104.3 jam."
02:09;02:11;"Classic rock radio."
02:11;02:14;"Wait, did you listen to classic Q in Connecticut?"
02:14;02:17;"No, we didn't get that, we had our own Connecticut classic rock stations."
02:17;02:21;"I-95, Danbury's, classic rock radio, and then"
02:21;02:23;"Just like named after the highway?"
02:23;02:25;"No, because I-95 doesn't go through Danbury."
02:25;02:27;"But I-95 goes through Connecticut."
02:27;02:30;"Oh yeah, it goes along, they're like southern Connecticut."
02:30;02:32;"But I-84 goes through Danbury."
02:32;02:37;"Never quite got a handle on why Danbury's classic rock station was I-95."
02:37;02:40;"Was it because it's like W-H-X-I?"
02:40;02:41;"Something like that."
02:41;02:43;"95.7?"
02:43;02:48;"95.1. W-H-G-I, Danbury's classic rock."
02:48;02:50;"And then we had W-P-L-R out of New Haven."
02:50;02:52;"Oh, so you got two classic rock?"
02:52;02:53;"We had two, dude."
02:53;02:54;"That explains a lot."
02:54;02:57;"Jake's just getting slammed by two classic rock radio stations."
02:57;03:01;"Getting Eddie money on this station, getting Eddie money on the other station."
03:01;03:02;"R.I.P."
03:02;03:04;"R.I.P., man."
03:04;03:10;"Yeah, it's funny, because I only had one classic rock radio station, classic Q104.3."
03:10;03:13;"And looking back on it, it was fairly idiosyncratic."
03:13;03:18;"I felt like one of the songs they played the most was Jessica by the Allman Brothers, the instrumental."
03:18;03:19;"Yep."
03:19;03:22;"Great one."
03:22;03:23;"Played that a ton."
03:23;03:25;"Not that much Led Zeppelin."
03:25;03:26;"Really?"
03:26;03:28;"I think we've had this conversation before."
03:28;03:33;"They've thrown Billy Joel, where I have this feeling that a classic rock radio station in Florida"
03:33;03:36;"is not going to be dropping New York State of Mind ever."
03:36;03:37;"Right."
03:37;03:39;"That's some regional love."
03:39;03:42;"Who needs a house out in Hackensack?"
03:43;03:46;"Sergeant Noel here is walking the beach."
03:46;03:49;"At night he becomes a bartender."
03:49;03:53;"He works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street."
03:53;03:56;"Across from the medical center."
03:56;04:01;"And he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac."
04:01;04:03;"Billy's super regional."
04:03;04:05;"Yeah, I feel like it's a classic."
04:05;04:07;"It's just like, oh, so yeah, it's the tour over, you done."
04:07;04:08;"Right."
04:08;04:11;"It'll just be like, this leg of the North American tour has ended."
04:11;04:16;"But, you know, the Father of the Bride cycle continues well into 2020."
04:16;04:18;"Oh, just announced some 2020 dates."
04:18;04:19;"Saw that."
04:19;04:20;"Not that long ago."
04:20;04:23;"Some secondary and tertiary markets."
04:23;04:25;"Looks great, man."
04:25;04:31;"I'm pretty psyched for your kind of inner Pacific Northwest mountain region tour starting in Bend."
04:31;04:33;"Oh, yeah, you got to come tailgate those shows, man."
04:33;04:34;"You're starting in Bend."
04:34;04:36;"Hop on the bus."
04:36;04:37;"Where else are you going?"
04:37;04:38;"I think, let me look it up."
04:38;04:39;"Missoula."
04:39;04:41;"And then Calgary."
04:41;04:42;"Yep."
04:42;04:44;"Great part of the country."
04:44;04:49;"I remember being on some tour that I feel like started in Calgary and went down into,"
04:49;04:51;"maybe ended up in Denver or something."
04:51;04:55;"And I just remember being like, wow, it's the longest I've ever spent in mountain time."
04:55;04:56;"Great time zone."
04:56;04:58;"Spent a lot of time in Eastern time."
04:58;04:59;"Sure."
04:59;05:00;"A lot of Pacific time."
05:00;05:01;"It's also the only one with a cool name."
05:01;05:02;"Yeah."
05:02;05:05;"It's interesting how it's like, there's no rhyme or reason."
05:05;05:09;"I guess in a real dystopian universe, they would have been called zone one, zone two,"
05:09;05:10;"zone three, and zone four."
05:10;05:12;"That's like in the Hunger Games."
05:12;05:13;"Totally."
05:13;05:16;"So Eastern time, that's where we're from."
05:16;05:17;"Yeah."
05:17;05:18;"But it's not Atlantic time."
05:18;05:21;"That would be kind of, have a little more flavor."
05:21;05:24;"On the two sides of the country, you have Pacific time, which is kind of cool."
05:24;05:25;"And then you have Eastern time."
05:25;05:26;"Hmm."
05:26;05:28;"Should have been Atlantic time."
05:28;05:29;"I would just rethought that one."
05:29;05:31;"And then you have Central time."
05:31;05:32;"That's pretty bland."
05:32;05:33;"That's a real bland."
05:33;05:35;"Well, imagine if that was called Heartland time."
05:35;05:36;"Heart time."
05:36;05:37;"Heartbeat."
05:37;05:39;"Yeah, that one, they don't even use time."
05:39;05:41;"That one's just called heartbeat."
05:41;05:42;"That's kind of like a radio station."
05:42;05:43;"Yeah."
05:43;05:45;"The heartbeat of America."
05:45;05:48;"It is 1 PM in the heartbeat of America."
05:48;05:50;"Yeah, Eastern time is the big dog."
05:50;05:51;"Big dog, heartbeat."
05:51;05:53;"Mountain time can stay, because that's a good one."
05:53;05:54;"Yeah."
05:54;05:56;"And then golden time."
05:56;06:01;"Yeah, but mountain time is definitely the most interesting of the American time zones."
06:01;06:04;"And I'm sure somebody's going to be like, well, what about the Hawaii time zone?"
06:04;06:06;"All right, I'm talking about continental US."
06:06;06:07;"Lower 48."
06:07;06:09;"You're talking lower 48."
06:09;06:11;"That's a tight name for something."
06:11;06:12;"Lower 48."
06:12;06:15;"I was thinking mountain time would be a good song title."
06:15;06:16;"For Mountain Bruce."
06:16;06:18;"Absolutely."
06:18;06:22;"I wonder what the-- I guess, is Denver the biggest city in mountain time?"
06:22;06:23;"Might be."
06:23;06:24;"Phoenix."
06:24;06:25;"Is Phoenix mountain time?"
06:25;06:27;"I think it is."
06:27;06:28;"Yeah."
06:28;06:30;"Arizona native is-- well, yeah, because it's not the same as--"
06:30;06:32;"Well, yeah, because it's not the same as LA, right?"
06:32;06:33;"Oh, yeah, it's got to be mountain time."
06:33;06:35;"Yeah, Phoenix is the biggest city in mountain time."
06:35;06:37;"Phoenix, very flat city."
06:37;06:39;"Great number crunching over there."
06:39;06:40;"Thank you, Seinfeld."
06:40;06:42;"Yeah, I just looked it up for you guys."
06:42;06:46;"Yeah, that's interesting to think somebody down in Phoenix, a notoriously flat city,"
06:46;06:49;"are they identifying with mountain time?"
06:49;06:50;"Right."
06:50;06:51;"But I feel like they're surrounded by mountains."
06:51;06:53;"Yeah, there are mountains in Arizona."
06:53;06:54;"So what's that leg though?"
06:54;06:55;"You're doing Bend?"
06:55;06:57;"Oh, you're doing Boise, I think."
06:57;06:58;"Oh, yeah, I haven't been there in a while."
06:58;07:00;"What's the venue in Boise, do you know?"
07:00;07:04;"The only two venues that when I think of Boise, I think of Neurolux."
07:04;07:05;"Have you played there?"
07:05;07:06;"Oh, yeah, definitely back in the day."
07:06;07:07;"I played there with Dirty Projectors too."
07:07;07:08;"Oh, yeah, I was there."
07:08;07:09;"Hold on."
07:09;07:12;"I got to go to vampireweekend.com to--"
07:12;07:13;"Like a seated auditorium in Boise."
07:13;07:16;"Yeah, my feeling was-- you know, we talked about what we could do this year."
07:16;07:20;"And it's tough because there's definitely some big cities where the tickets went really fast."
07:20;07:25;"It just felt like, you know what, we'll be back sooner rather than later, next album."
07:25;07:28;"But, like, it seemed cooler just to hit new spots."
07:28;07:30;"Let's see."
07:30;07:33;"Boise, we're playing the Ford Idaho Center Amphitheater."
07:33;07:36;"Missoula, Montana, Kettle House Amphitheater."
07:36;07:39;"I've heard very good things about the Kettle House Amphitheater."
07:39;07:43;"So these are outdoor seated, kind of like a Libby Bowl."
07:43;07:44;"Yeah."
07:44;07:46;"Oh, these ones are next summer."
07:46;07:48;"But that's the way of now."
07:48;07:51;"You just put all your tickets up at the same time, let people know."
07:51;07:54;"So people are buying tickets for a show that's like 10 months from now?"
07:54;07:57;"Yeah, I guess that's kind of the vibe now is like the--"
07:57;08:00;"because even this year, I think it was smart."
08:00;08:02;"Like our touring people were just like-- they planned the whole year out,"
08:02;08:04;"and they were like, let's just put all the tickets on sale together."
08:04;08:06;"And, you know, you could probably get into one school and be like,"
08:06;08:09;"yeah, isn't it more exciting if you wait a little bit to announce the next--"
08:09;08:11;"and they're just like, just put them all up at the same time."
08:11;08:13;"You know, they'll do their thing at different rates."
08:13;08:18;"Because when I think about it, like, we put up the tickets kind of as soon as we were back."
08:18;08:20;"So, you know, some of the shows were like four months away."
08:20;08:24;"And then shows like the Garden or the Hollywood Bowl were like seven or eight months away."
08:24;08:28;"That way you let the hardcore fans have like-- they can get the tickets really quick."
08:28;08:31;"You know, actually there's a big tour for next summer that was just announced."
08:31;08:33;"Are you aware of this?"
08:33;08:36;"Give me a hint."
08:36;08:41;"Um, three bands more or less associated with pop punk."
08:41;08:43;"Is it Weezer, Green Day?"
08:43;08:44;"Yeah, who else?"
08:44;08:45;"Blink?"
08:45;08:47;"No."
08:47;08:49;"I wonder how Blink feels about this, actually."
08:49;08:51;"They just started Lil Wayne."
08:51;08:56;"But another-- Weezer, Green Day, and another like huge--"
08:56;08:59;"Is the third band as big as those bands?"
08:59;09:02;"The third band, I bet you don't know as much about."
09:02;09:05;"They're bigger than Weezer, Green Day, hard to say."
09:05;09:06;"I don't think you're gonna guess."
09:06;09:07;"I'm stumped."
09:07;09:08;"It's Fall Out Boy."
09:08;09:09;"Oh, yeah, that's after my time."
09:09;09:11;"I've been trying to get Pete Wince on the show for a minute."
09:11;09:12;"That's right."
09:12;09:14;"He said he was down. I'm gonna reach out to him again."
09:14;09:17;"It's a stadium tour going big."
09:17;09:18;"The Hella Mega Tour."
09:18;09:19;"It's called the Hella Mega Tour."
09:19;09:21;"Good title."
09:21;09:24;"So that's gonna go Fall Out Boy, Weezer, Green Day."
09:24;09:25;"That's the order of events."
09:25;09:27;"Nah."
09:27;09:29;"Weezer first to three."
09:29;09:30;"Well, actually, there's a--"
09:30;09:32;"Not if I'm booking it."
09:32;09:34;"There's a Scott punk band called The Interrupters"
09:34;09:37;"who I've been following for a minute as a Scott punk enthusiast."
09:37;09:38;"That's cool."
09:38;09:39;"They're technically first to four,"
09:39;09:43;"but the way it's spelled is like Green Day, Fall Out Boy, Weezer,"
09:43;09:45;"with special guest The Interrupters."
09:45;09:46;"So, you know, they're kind of--"
09:46;09:48;"They're kicking things off, but that's different."
09:48;09:53;"So of the big three, Weezer is the lowest ranked."
09:53;09:57;"I don't know one Fall Out Boy song, but that's just my--"
09:57;09:58;"You don't know--"
09:58;10:00;"♪ We're going down, down, and then around ♪"
10:00;10:02;"♪ Sugar me, coming down swinging ♪"

10:05;10:06;"I don't know it, man."
10:06;10:08;"We've listened to them on this show, too."
10:08;10:11;"Like, they basically started as like a very--"
10:11;10:13;"When was their heyday? Like early 2000s?"
10:13;10:15;"I think their heyday was early 2000s,"
10:15;10:18;"and then they kind of broke up or took a beat"
10:18;10:21;"and then came back with like full-on,"
10:21;10:24;"like pumped-up stadium rock pop kind of stuff."
10:24;10:27;"This is like their early beloved song."
10:27;10:31;"♪"
10:31;10:33;"Oh, it's heavy."
10:33;10:34;"Well, yeah."

11:54;11:56;"He's the bassist, not the singer."
11:56;11:57;"Oh, wow, okay."
11:57;11:59;"Kind of like a Who situation."
11:59;12:02;"He's the Pete Townsend/Nwhistle."
12:02;12:05;"They were known for having very long song titles and stuff."
12:05;12:06;"Oh, wow."
12:06;12:08;"They paved the way for Panic! at the Disco,"
12:08;12:10;"who you're probably a little more familiar with."
12:10;12:11;"Actually, I'm not."
12:11;12:13;"Well, but you know that one song."
12:13;12:15;"I can actually hear a little GBV in there for sure,"
12:15;12:17;"and certainly some Weezer."
12:17;12:19;"Oh, man, we got to get Wentz on the show and just be like,"
12:19;12:20;"""Dude, GBV."""
12:20;12:21;"GBV, Weezer."
12:21;12:23;"Oh, sure, Weezer."
12:23;12:25;"But there's no way that Pete Wentz doesn't know"
12:25;12:26;"who Guy to Buy Voices is."
12:26;12:27;"Sure."
12:27;12:29;"To what extent he's a fan, I have no idea."
12:29;12:30;"Right."
12:30;12:31;"He knows his [bleep]"
12:31;12:32;"He's up on stuff."
12:32;12:34;"It might be just like a micro-generation thing."
12:34;12:36;"Yeah."
12:36;12:38;"Then they came back kind of like turbo-charged,"
12:38;12:41;"like with just--"
12:41;12:42;"What year is this?"
12:42;12:43;"This is like a couple years ago."
12:43;12:45;"This is like their big comeback."

12:55;12:57;"So the singer is just like the singer."
12:57;12:59;"Yeah, his name is Patrick Stump."
12:59;13:01;"Cool name."
13:01;13:02;"Pat Stump."
13:02;13:04;"Yeah, why is he not Pat Stump?"
13:04;13:07;"Yeah, 'cause Patrick Stump went solo for a minute."
13:07;13:12;"He went solo, and then they reunited."
13:12;13:15;"I saw a band last night"
13:15;13:17;"where the singer is only the singer."
13:17;13:18;"What band?"
13:18;13:19;"The Zombies."
13:19;13:20;"Oh."
13:20;13:21;"Yeah, what's the story with the Zombies?"
13:21;13:23;"I went to the Greek theater"
13:23;13:25;"with friend of the show Daniel Ralston."
13:25;13:26;"Oh, right, right."
13:26;13:30;"And the Zombies played the Odyssey and Oracle in sequence."
13:30;13:31;"Whoa."
13:31;13:32;"It was so tight."
13:32;13:36;"But Daniel was telling me that they broke up"
13:36;13:39;"right after that record was released in '68 or '69."
13:39;13:40;"Yeah."
13:40;13:42;"And then--what's his name?"
13:42;13:45;"Colin Blundstone, the singer?"
13:45;13:46;"Yeah, and then there's Rod Argent."
13:46;13:48;"Yeah, Rod Argent was the keyboard player"
13:48;13:50;"who I think wrote a lot of the material."
13:50;13:52;"And then he started a band called Argent."
13:52;13:53;"Right."
13:53;13:54;"♪ Hold your head up ♪"
13:54;13:57;"But Colin apparently was just the singer,"
13:57;13:58;"and then when the band broke up,"
13:58;14:00;"worked as an accountant for five years."
14:00;14:01;"Whoa."
14:01;14:02;"Into the mid-'70s."
14:02;14:04;"He was just out."
14:04;14:06;"But these guys were all in their mid-'70s."
14:06;14:10;"It was Rod Argent, Colin, this guy Chris White,"
14:10;14:12;"I think his name is, who's the original bass player,"
14:12;14:14;"who looked like Donald Rumsfeld."
14:14;14:15;"Yeah."
14:15;14:18;"Just like these guys in their '70s."
14:18;14:19;"Yeah."
14:19;14:21;"And he's wearing a suit that was a little too big for him."
14:21;14:22;"Yeah."
14:22;14:23;"It was a cool vibe."
14:23;14:27;"And then they had another five or six people on stage"
14:27;14:29;"just doing it note for note."
14:29;14:30;"Right, you need a lot of people on stage"
14:30;14:31;"to perform that whole album."
14:31;14:33;"It was so tight."
14:33;14:36;"And then Brian Wilson played, and that was rough."
14:36;14:37;"Rough stuff?"
14:37;14:38;"Yeah."

14:46;14:47;"Oh, yeah."
14:47;14:50;"They opened for Arcade Fire at the Greek last year, I think."
14:50;14:52;"I think Daniel went to that, too, 'cause he wrote a story."

16:37;16:41;"I don't think I've talked about it, but in early days"
16:41;16:44;"when I'd come stay in L.A. for like a week or two,"
16:44;16:48;"I would stay up at a neighborhood some people call Beverly Glen,"
16:48;16:52;"which is like, you know, kind of west side L.A. up in the hills."
16:52;16:55;"And that part of up in the hills, it's like so high up."
16:55;16:59;"When you're up by Mulholland, you really feel like you're the top of a mountain."
16:59;17:02;"I think I've told you how I'd go up to the door of the house"
17:02;17:05;"and there'd be like a full-on giant buck,"

17:08;17:11;"""Oh my God, if that thing hit a person, they'd die instantly."""
17:11;17:13;"You know, like a 1,200-pound animal."
17:13;17:15;"But anyway, so you're up there."
17:15;17:19;"You're right up at kind of the peak of the mountain up by Mulholland."
17:19;17:20;"Yeah."
17:20;17:23;"And up there, it's almost entirely residential,"
17:23;17:26;"except there's this one little shopping area"
17:26;17:29;"that I think is called the Beverly Glen Shops or something."
17:29;17:33;"It's one little mini mall up in the hills,"
17:33;17:36;"because otherwise for everything else, you have to go down the hill"
17:36;17:39;"either to the L.A. side or to the valley side."
17:39;17:45;"So up there, there's this one kind of East Coast-ish, Jewish-ish deli/diner"
17:45;17:47;"called the Beverly Glen Deli."
17:47;17:52;"And it's a funny place where I'd be up there kind of by myself,"
17:52;17:56;"and so I'd be like--hilarious, like jump in the car for three minutes,"
17:56;17:59;"get to this place, and if I wanted to have breakfast or a cup of coffee"
17:59;18:02;"or something, I'd go to this spot."
18:02;18:06;"And, you know, it has the charm a little bit of kind of like a low-key"
18:06;18:11;"East Coast deli, but it's up in the hills surrounded by not only rich people,"
18:11;18:14;"but right by there, there's some of these gated communities."
18:14;18:16;"That's always a funny vibe when you're in a rich neighborhood"
18:16;18:19;"and then you see the gated community, and you're just like, okay."
18:19;18:20;"Layer upon layer."
18:20;18:24;"Yeah, and there's this one gated community up there that's like--"
18:24;18:26;"I've been in there once or twice."
18:26;18:29;"I'm pretty sure DJ Khaled lives in there, Rod Stewart."
18:29;18:31;"It's just like, you know, true."
18:31;18:32;"Heavy hitters."
18:33;18:37;"I remember just being up there, and I'd be eating solo a lot, you know,"
18:37;18:39;"because it's that type of thing."
18:39;18:43;"It's not like you're down in Silver Lake, just hit a bunch of people,"
18:43;18:45;"like, oh, you want to come through, you know?"
18:45;18:49;"You're up literally in Asgard, you know what I mean?"
18:49;18:52;"That's an MCU reference."
18:52;18:53;"I didn't actually get it."
18:53;18:55;"I just kind of played along to keep the story going."
18:55;18:56;"It's a Thor thing."
18:57;18:58;"Missed it."
18:58;19:00;"So anyway, you're basically up in Asgard."
19:00;19:01;"People can't just jump--"
19:01;19:02;"Oh, yeah."
19:02;19:06;"--into the portal, you know, very easily to come link up with you."
19:06;19:08;"So I'd be rolling solo to the deli a lot."
19:08;19:10;"You know, I saw all sorts of funny people, you know,"
19:10;19:15;"people like really hardcore music industry legends that the listeners wouldn't know"
19:15;19:18;"who they are, you know, like some old-school lawyer that I've heard about,"
19:18;19:20;"you know, and these are just like they're on the phone,"
19:20;19:23;"you know, like a bagel, like papers all spread out."
19:23;19:27;"So you'd recognize like a legendary music industry lawyer,"
19:27;19:29;"like from documentaries?"
19:29;19:30;"A little bit of that."
19:30;19:35;"And, you know, just being in the game long enough that people like point out"
19:35;19:37;"these types to me."
19:37;19:40;"One time I remember Jon Voight eating solo."
19:40;19:41;"Booth or counter?"
19:41;19:42;"Booth."
19:42;19:44;"He was reading some like right-wing book."
19:44;19:46;"It was like very on the nose."
19:46;19:48;"But anyway, the real part of the story is that."
19:48;19:51;"So I was, you know, I might be eating breakfast there three or four times a week,"
19:51;19:53;"you know, over the course of a week."
19:53;19:55;"So you were really like regular there for a while."
19:55;19:56;"Yeah, a week here or there."
19:56;19:57;"And these people are super regulars."
19:57;19:58;"Right."
19:58;20:03;"So I would say minimum four times, maybe like six or seven times,"
20:03;20:06;"a lot of times I saw Brian Wilson come in and eat solo."
20:06;20:08;"He must live near there."
20:08;20:10;"And it was always really interesting because, like, you know, Jon Voight,"
20:10;20:12;"you look at him and you're just like, yeah,"
20:12;20:15;"that's like a crotchety old dude reading his book and having his coffee"
20:15;20:16;"or whatever."
20:16;20:19;"But Brian Wilson was different because--and I was always so curious about,"
20:19;20:23;"you know, obviously his life is filled with mystery and people are like,"
20:23;20:24;"you know, what's up with him?"
20:24;20:25;"Yeah."
20:25;20:26;"I never saw that."
20:26;20:28;"I saw a movie a few years ago that was like about--"
20:28;20:29;"Love and Mercy."
20:30;20:31;"Did you see that?"
20:31;20:32;"Yeah, it was good."
20:32;20:33;"It was good."
20:33;20:36;"So people say like this doctor giving him all sorts of stuff that damaged--who"
20:36;20:37;"knows?"
20:37;20:39;"Clearly he's had all sorts of struggles in his life."
20:39;20:42;"So he would always come in the door by himself."
20:42;20:44;"But I could tell, I was like, this is a dude who doesn't drive."
20:44;20:45;"So clearly somebody was waiting outside."
20:45;20:46;"He got dropped."
20:46;20:47;"Yeah, he got dropped."
20:47;20:48;"And then he would sit down."
20:48;20:51;"He was such a regular that people would always come up to him and say like,"
20:51;20:54;"oh, hey, Brian, how are you doing?"
20:54;20:55;"And I saw this--"
20:55;20:59;"Like they would talk to him like he was a child sort of?"
20:59;21:00;"Slightly."
21:00;21:02;"Or just talking to like a sweet old person."
21:02;21:05;"But I'm just saying they would go out of their way to be like, oh,"
21:05;21:06;"we know you."
21:06;21:07;"How are you?"
21:07;21:08;"Whatever."
21:08;21:09;"And I saw this many times because it's a small place."
21:09;21:12;"It'd be like me, Jon Voight, and Brian Wilson just all sitting solo at a"
21:12;21:13;"booth."
21:13;21:14;"That's a solid crew."
21:14;21:16;"Yeah, it was a tight crew."
21:16;21:20;"Imagine one day I was just like, guys, every day we're in here sitting,"
21:20;21:22;"you know, sitting together."
21:22;21:23;"We're all in show biz."
21:23;21:24;"Why don't we sit together?"
21:24;21:25;"Let's just grab a booth."
21:25;21:27;"Let's just grab a booth."
21:27;21:29;"You guys probably knew each other back in the day."
21:29;21:30;"What's up, man?"
21:30;21:31;"Jon, what are you reading there?"
21:31;21:38;"But so I noticed with Brian Wilson just, yeah,"
21:38;21:40;"the people would come up and just be like, oh, hey, Brian,"
21:40;21:41;"how are you doing today?"
21:41;21:42;"And just like he would never engage."
21:42;21:45;"And he would just go like breakfast burrito."
21:45;21:47;"So, you know, obviously a legend."
21:47;21:50;"I was always interested by how often he got a breakfast burrito."
21:50;21:52;"But, you know, he'd speak kind of loudly."
21:52;21:53;"Yeah."
21:53;21:55;"It was interesting because I see these people kind of go up to him like,"
21:55;21:56;"oh, yeah, what's up?"
21:56;21:58;"And you just like not really look at them and just don't say the thing."
21:58;22:02;"They'd bring it out, scarf it down in and out in like 12 minutes."
22:02;22:03;"Like you would just crush that burrito."
22:03;22:04;"Yeah."
22:04;22:06;"You know, I don't want to like speculate too much on the man's life."
22:06;22:09;"He's a legend, but it certainly got me curious about like,"
22:09;22:10;"what does this do?"
22:10;22:11;"You know, we love day to day."
22:11;22:13;"I was like, what is this dude's day to day life?"
22:13;22:17;"And I guess also the reason that I bring it up is he's been through the"
22:17;22:18;"ringer in his life."
22:18;22:21;"So it doesn't shock me that maybe he's in this kind of state of mind where"
22:21;22:22;"he's just like, you know what?"
22:22;22:23;"Drop me off."
22:23;22:24;"Let me eat my breakfast burrito."
22:24;22:25;"No time for niceties."
22:25;22:26;"Yeah."
22:26;22:27;"Whatever."
22:27;22:28;"He's on his own trip."
22:28;22:29;"That's not weird."
22:29;22:31;"I think the thing that struck me when I was like, oh,"
22:31;22:33;"but he still goes on tour and makes albums and stuff."
22:33;22:35;"I was like, that's interesting."
22:35;22:36;"Yeah."
22:36;22:38;"I mean, I think, like I said at this show, I mean,"
22:38;22:42;"he must have someone that's just like holding his hand the whole step of the"
22:42;22:45;"way, like right until he sits down at the piano."
22:45;22:47;"But he can play piano."
22:47;22:50;"Well, the, you know how normally on a stage,"
22:50;22:53;"the piano is like kind of set sideways so you can see the hands."
22:53;22:58;"This was just sort of like set at a 90 degree angle to the audience."
22:58;22:59;"You're looking straight at him."
22:59;23:01;"You're looking at the back of the piano and you're looking at him."
23:01;23:04;"I don't think he was, he was truly like, it was sad."
23:04;23:06;"It was truly like almost like, um,"
23:06;23:09;"like the final days of like a third world dictator."
23:09;23:10;"Like they wheel them out."
23:10;23:11;"Yeah."
23:11;23:13;"And there's like a teleprompter and it's just sort of was like,"
23:13;23:14;"it was a bummer."
23:14;23:15;"How old is he?"
23:15;23:17;"He's got to be in his seventies."
23:17;23:21;"I guess it's the type of thing where obviously it's like a controversial"
23:21;23:22;"subject."
23:22;23:25;"You know, there's been a lot of speculation and talk about Richard Simmons."
23:25;23:28;"People believe that he's like elder abuse,"
23:28;23:31;"that maybe he's suffering from dementia or something like that."
23:31;23:35;"And he's being kind of kept away and alive so that he can like sign away"
23:35;23:39;"some of his fortune to family members or people who don't have his best"
23:39;23:40;"interests at heart."
23:40;23:42;"You know, it's really tricky when people get older and don't have all their"
23:42;23:43;"faculties."
23:43;23:45;"I mean, maybe Brian's having a great time."
23:45;23:47;"It's very like very raw."
23:47;23:53;"And like the decline of like every human that is in our future is like"
23:53;23:55;"fully on stage."
23:55;23:58;"It's not like, but they're playing this like fun, happy music."
23:58;24:01;"And there's a guy that's like completely checked out sitting in the dead"
24:01;24:06;"center of the stage, literally just staring out into the sky."
24:06;24:07;"It's really crazy."
24:07;24:11;"And so, but maybe he's having a great time and he's like, I love this music."
24:11;24:13;"I love my band."
24:13;24:14;"Yeah, I guess that's maybe."
24:14;24:15;"I don't know what's going on."
24:15;24:16;"It's a weird show though."
24:16;24:18;"Obviously everybody gets older."
24:18;24:20;"You got to deal with different stuff."
24:20;24:23;"There's probably a lot of people who just want to, to want to see people."
24:23;24:24;"Yeah."
24:24;24:29;"There's an epidemic of loneliness in this country as we've discussed way back"
24:29;24:31;"in the day, especially with older people."
24:31;24:34;"And you know, they might just want to be around people."
24:34;24:35;"Yeah."
24:35;24:38;"Performing at the Greek theater."
24:38;24:39;"I wonder."
24:39;24:40;"Yeah, I guess that's it."
24:40;24:43;"Based on what you're describing and I've never seen him live."
24:43;24:47;"I don't think that's the type of thing where you just want to know that even"
24:47;24:51;"though he might be a little more checked out, maybe that happens."
24:51;24:52;"Yeah."
24:52;24:53;"I'm just saying that."
24:53;24:54;"Yeah."
24:54;24:56;"You want to think that somebody like is talking about it with him and whatever"
24:56;25:01;"his demeanor or like if his face doesn't express joy in the way that it did"
25:01;25:03;"when he was 25, like that's normal."
25:03;25:07;"As long as he's basically like, no, this is what I want to do."
25:07;25:11;"Because if you feel like your life is defined by playing music and performing."
25:11;25:12;"Yeah."
25:12;25:13;"Because he probably doesn't do interviews anymore."
25:13;25:14;"Does he?"
25:14;25:15;"I have no idea."
25:15;25:18;"I guess he did an interview in 2016 with Rolling Stone."
25:18;25:19;"I wonder what that interview was though."
25:19;25:23;"That was like over email with his assistant or that was like actually a sit"
25:23;25:24;"down."
25:24;25:26;"I have something here from the Palm Springs desert sun."
25:26;25:27;"Yeah."
25:27;25:28;"August of this year."
25:28;25:30;"An interview with Brian Wilson."
25:30;25:31;"Yeah."
25:31;25:34;"Uh, talking about touring with the zombies."
25:34;25:35;"Oh yeah."
25:35;25:37;"It's a great night of music folks."
25:37;25:41;"Just, he's just like, you know, mortality was just on full display."
25:41;25:43;"Always get some hole in the crowd."
25:43;25:47;"Who's like, you know, nitpicking my vibe on stage."
25:47;25:48;"Listen, like I'm an old dude."
25:48;25:51;"I can't bring the energy like I used to, but I'm having a ball out there."
25:51;25:53;"I guess I gotta be honest."
25:53;25:54;"I'm having the time of my life."
25:54;25:57;"This is from that 2016 article."
25:57;25:58;"A few days early,"
25:58;26:01;"the singer songwriter and founding Beach Boy celebrated his 74th birthday."
26:01;26:04;"And when the subject comes up, his eyes widen."
26:04;26:06;"It was the greatest birthday of my life."
26:06;26:08;"He says, I'm crossing his arms."
26:08;26:10;"We went to a place called Peter Luger's."
26:10;26:12;"You got to go there."
26:12;26:13;"You will love it."
26:13;26:15;"I had the greatest steak dinner that I ever had in my whole life."
26:15;26:16;"He dropped an F bomb."
26:16;26:20;"He waits a beat and raises his voice in my whole life."
26:20;26:22;"Maybe he just lives for food and music."
26:22;26:23;"Now."
26:23;26:24;"Loving those steaks."
26:24;26:25;"Loving those breakfast burritos."
26:25;26:27;"You know what I think?"
26:27;26:29;"Loving the late sixties Beach Boys stuff."
26:29;26:30;"I bet he's chilling."
26:30;26:32;"Al Jardine was on stage with them."
26:32;26:33;"Oh, that's tight."
26:33;26:34;"It was funny."
26:34;26:35;"Cause like, yeah,"
26:35;26:38;"they're playing stuff off like smile and cause yeah,"
26:38;26:40;"they did heroes and villains and they were doing stuff of surfs up."
26:40;26:42;"And that's like George Gershwin level,"
26:42;26:44;"sophisticated composition."
26:44;26:47;"And then it'd be like, now we're doing an Al Jardine song."
26:47;26:49;"And it's just like, I can't remember what they were."
26:49;26:52;"Just like the funniest, just like garage rock."
26:52;26:54;"Bar band garage rock."
26:54;26:56;"Between those guys."
26:56;26:58;"Going down to the beach and doing their stuff."
26:58;27:00;"It's like, it was like,"
27:00;27:02;"that's like really kind of an old school band vibe."
27:02;27:03;"Yeah."
27:03;27:04;"Like there's like one,"
27:04;27:05;"one or two geniuses."
27:05;27:08;"And then there's like another guy or two that also write songs."
27:08;27:11;"Well, that was like a recurring joke in Bohemian Rhapsody."
27:11;27:14;"They would always kind of razz the drummer because they'd be like"
27:14;27:16;"single from the cell."
27:16;27:18;"It's gotta be Bohemian Rhapsody."
27:18;27:19;"There's like, it's opera."
27:19;27:20;"It's, you know,"
27:20;27:21;"it's our most ambitious work yet."
27:21;27:22;"And then the joke in the movies,"
27:22;27:24;"he's always like, what about my song?"
27:24;27:25;"I love my car."
27:25;27:29;"I don't know if that was like reflective of the actual dynamic in the band,"
27:29;27:32;"but they made that a joke that it was like Brian May and like,"
27:32;27:33;"obviously Freddie Mercury."
27:33;27:34;"Yeah."
27:34;27:35;"Just like this very sophisticated stuff."
27:35;27:37;"And it's like, I love my car."
27:37;27:39;"It's a good rock tune, man."
27:39;27:41;"Well, anyway, shout out to Brian Wilson."
27:41;27:42;"I bet he's chilling."
27:42;27:44;"I've been in this town so long,"
27:44;27:45;"the back of the city."
27:45;27:48;"I've been taken for a lost gun."
27:48;27:52;"And I've known for a long, long time."
27:52;27:56;"Held in love musical with an innocent girl"
27:56;27:59;"From the Spanish and Indian home"
27:59;28:01;"Of the heroes and villains"
28:01;28:07;"Once a knight could change land and water"
28:07;28:10;"And she was riding the rein of the foes"
28:10;28:13;"That eventually brought her down"
28:13;28:18;"But she's still dancing in the night and the rain"
28:18;28:20;"Of what a deed will do in a town"
28:20;28:23;"For the heroes and villains"
28:23;28:25;"Ah"
28:25;28:32;"Heroes and villains"
28:32;28:37;"Just see what you've done"
28:37;28:48;"Heroes and villains"
28:48;28:53;"Just see what you've done"
28:53;29:09;"I mean, we've been following this story for a long time."
29:09;29:11;"I don't know if we've talked about it that much on air,"
29:11;29:14;"but I got a lot of texts, got a lot of emails"
29:14;29:17;"from people when the news broke to the mainstream."
29:17;29:21;"That the Richard Montanez biopic is happening."
29:21;29:24;"I feel like we willed this into existence."
29:24;29:26;"I kind of feel that way."
29:26;29:29;"Tom Christmas is very influential."
29:29;29:33;"By the way, you see how many people have been covering"
29:33;29:35;"winter starbucking lately?"
29:35;29:36;"Yeah, it's crazy."
29:36;29:41;"BBC, Fox News, CNN, Seth Meyers."
29:41;29:42;"Oh, Seth Meyers?"
29:42;29:43;"Yeah."
29:43;29:44;"What, did he do a joke about it?"
29:44;29:45;"Yeah, he kind of ripped on winter."
29:45;29:46;"But I think winter was down."
29:46;29:50;"Oh no, the joke was a man's mission to visit every"
29:50;29:51;"Starbucks in the world."
29:51;29:54;"He finally reaches 15,000 Starbucks and they finally"
29:54;29:56;"spelled his name right on his cup and it cut to this cup."
29:56;29:58;"It's a dork."
29:58;30:01;"And winter was like, oh man, but you know what?"
30:01;30:03;"Respect coming from Seth Meyers or something like that."
30:03;30:04;"And then like--"
30:04;30:05;"Not cool, Seth."
30:05;30:07;"Yeah, it's like Seth, come on, bro."
30:07;30:08;"Yeah, f*** you."
30:08;30:10;"(laughter)"
30:10;30:12;"I mean, real talk."
30:12;30:14;"Seinfeld is going hard on--"
30:14;30:16;"Cutting through all the noise with that one."
30:16;30:18;"Should we try to get Seth Meyers on the show?"
30:18;30:19;"Hash this out?"
30:19;30:20;"I would love that."
30:20;30:23;"Yeah, let's see Seth Meyers around here and there."
30:23;30:26;"Yeah, I think I could get his email very quickly."
30:26;30:29;"I'd like send him like, hey man, so we'd love it if you'd"
30:29;30:32;"come on-- he would just be like-- I bet he literally"
30:32;30:34;"wouldn't know what we were talking about."
30:34;30:36;"Yeah, he just read that joke."
30:36;30:39;"Yeah, like I do 20 of those jokes a night."
30:39;30:40;"Yeah."
30:40;30:42;"What the f*** are you talking about?"
30:42;30:45;"He's a friend-- because we do a show, and Winter's like"
30:45;30:47;"a kind of character on our show."
30:47;30:50;"You do a show, we do a show, you got your kind of guys,"
30:50;30:52;"we got our guys, Winter's one of our guys, man."
30:52;30:55;"We just-- it didn't sit right with us."
30:55;30:58;"She's like, I have no idea."
30:58;31:00;"The Starbucks joke."
31:00;31:02;"Which Starbucks joke?"
31:02;31:04;"Obviously, Winter deserves all the credit."
31:04;31:06;"He's the one who went to 15,000 Starbucks."
31:06;31:10;"All I'm saying is that time crisis, we've been covering him"
31:10;31:15;"since 2017, because we tell the stories that matter first."
31:15;31:20;"One question is, I wonder if any of those outlets did pick up"
31:20;31:26;"on the story via time crisis, chose not to give us credit."
31:26;31:29;"Some like intern in the writer's room."
31:29;31:30;"The TC head?"
31:30;31:33;"It was like, hey, I got an idea."
31:33;31:34;"Who knows?"
31:34;31:36;"But whatever, Winter deserves the credit for all the press."
31:36;31:42;"All I'm saying is, as usual, we beat the lamestream media by years."
31:42;31:45;"Well, Winter blasted out a press release."
31:45;31:47;"Remember he was asking for our notes on it?"
31:47;31:48;"No, I missed that."
31:48;31:50;"I missed that email."
31:50;31:53;"He sent an email being like, hey, what are your thoughts"
31:53;31:55;"on this press release?"
31:55;31:56;"When was this?"
31:56;31:58;"Like a month ago."
31:58;31:59;"Totally missed that."
31:59;32:00;"Oops."
32:00;32:03;"All right, we found one article that loops us in."
32:03;32:05;"Very self-indulgent part of the show."
32:05;32:09;"Looking for articles on the internet that reference our own show."
32:09;32:13;"For the last 22 years, Winter has been the subject of many people's fascination."
32:13;32:16;"In 2006, he was the star of a documentary called Starbucking"
32:16;32:17;"by Bill Tangerman."
32:17;32:19;"We've got to watch that."
32:19;32:23;"I guess there was a full documentary a decade before we were on it,"
32:23;32:24;"so we don't deserve too much credit."
32:24;32:27;"Well, my first communication with him goes back to '03."
32:27;32:28;"Okay."
32:28;32:29;"Emailed in '03."
32:29;32:32;"It's funny because the next line of this, news outlets have written articles"
32:32;32:35;"about him since as early as 2002."
32:35;32:36;"Okay."
32:36;32:37;"Well, somehow I found him."
32:37;32:43;"A headline in the Palm Beach Post from 2007 reads, ""Is he off his bean?"""
32:43;32:44;"Off his bean."
32:44;32:45;"Disrespectful."
32:45;32:47;"[Bleep] you, Palm Beach Post."
32:47;32:49;"Is that an expression?"
32:49;32:51;"It's like off your rocker."
32:51;32:54;"Definitely your bean referred to as your head is a thing."
32:54;32:55;"Sure."
32:55;32:56;"And recently he's been--"
32:56;32:57;"They're pushing it with that palm."
32:57;32:58;"Yeah, right."
32:58;33:00;"Recently he's been featured a few times on the podcast."
33:00;33:02;"[Bleep]"
33:02;33:05;"Time Crisis hosted by Vampire Weekend frontman Ezra Kanning."
33:05;33:06;"Okay, we need--"
33:06;33:08;"And American painter."
33:08;33:12;"Yeah, what about American painter and radio personality?"
33:12;33:17;"As well as Twitter celebrity Seinfeld 2000."
33:17;33:18;"Influencer."
33:18;33:19;"Influencer, sorry, wrong term."
33:19;33:20;"It's okay."
33:20;33:24;"I'm an American musician and radio personality,"
33:24;33:26;"Jake's an American painter and music personality."
33:26;33:31;"Seinfeld is a Canadian influencer and radio personality."
33:31;33:33;"Would it be Canadian-American or just Canadian?"
33:33;33:34;"Just Canadian."
33:34;33:35;"Wait, are you Canadian-American?"
33:35;33:36;"No."
33:36;33:37;"I mean, you live in America, so it's like--"
33:37;33:38;"Yeah, you're allowed to."
33:38;33:40;"I feel American."
33:40;33:44;"Don't buy into outdated notions of citizenship, man."
33:44;33:46;"Can we say North American?"
33:46;33:47;"Too vague."
33:47;33:50;"North American influencer."
33:50;33:51;"Oh, but you know, by the way, speaking of--"
33:51;33:55;"Before we dive back into the Montanhas, I met Patrick World in Montreal."
33:55;33:56;"Oh, yeah."
33:56;33:57;"Yeah."
33:57;34:02;"Yeah, he DMed us, and yeah, I put him in touch with your management,"
34:02;34:06;"and I'm glad you guys had a chance to meet."
34:06;34:07;"Shout-out to Patrick World."
34:07;34:12;"It was tight because two people from my high school, Pete and Celia,"
34:12;34:16;"a couple from my town, Glen Ridge, they're married now, and they live in Vermont."
34:16;34:19;"Are they a TC couple?"
34:19;34:22;"I don't remember if they said they listen to TC,"
34:22;34:27;"but they came to see Vampire Weekend, and people from Vermont go see shows"
34:27;34:28;"in Montreal a lot."
34:28;34:29;"Yeah, closest city."
34:29;34:30;"That can be their closest city."
34:30;34:33;"Oh, yeah, we used to drive down, do some cross-border shopping,"
34:33;34:34;"and then we saw--"
34:34;34:35;"In Vermont?"
34:35;34:38;"Yeah, we saw Louis Guzman once at Sweetwater when I was a kid."
34:38;34:39;"In Vermont?"
34:39;34:40;"Yeah."
34:40;34:41;"In like Montpelier or what city?"
34:41;34:42;"Burlington."
34:42;34:43;"Okay."
34:43;34:46;"Okay, so there's a nice cultural exchange between Burlington and Montreal."
34:46;34:51;"Yeah, actually, Luis, who we knew from doing stuff for Bernie Sanders,"
34:51;34:52;"came up too."
34:52;34:53;"Oh, yeah."
34:53;34:54;"It was a little Burlington crew, and it was good to see them"
34:54;34:58;"and just kind of catch up on our hometown and stuff."
34:58;35:02;"But it's funny, you're backstage, and you see a bunch of people"
35:02;35:04;"who are at the show, so you talk to some people, and somebody comes up,"
35:04;35:07;"and like, ""Oh, hey,"" you know, you often have--"
35:07;35:10;"I guess this could happen at any type of gathering or party,"
35:10;35:12;"but specifically at aftershows sometimes,"
35:12;35:15;"especially if Vampire Weekend aftershow could be like the most random mix"
35:15;35:16;"of people, because suddenly you're--"
35:16;35:19;"like two people you're just talking to, they're kind of sitting there waiting."
35:19;35:21;"So I was just like, ""Then that happened, and I'm talking to Patrick,"
35:21;35:24;"and he's telling me we're catching up, and I'm thanking him"
35:24;35:28;"for all the great work he's done for the show and for supporting us,"
35:28;35:29;"and he's telling me more about his background."""
35:29;35:31;"He actually has a bit of a radio background."
35:31;35:32;"Oh, okay."
35:32;35:33;"That was cool."
35:33;35:35;"Oh, one thing also he confirmed, he doesn't make the tracks."
35:35;35:40;"Okay, he's not doing live drums on his cover of ""Boys Are Back in Town."""
35:40;35:41;"Which--"
35:41;35:42;"Oh, wow."
35:42;35:43;"Which makes sense."
35:43;35:44;"I'm like weird Al Yankovic."
35:44;35:46;"Does Al build from the ground up?"
35:46;35:47;"Al builds everything from the ground up."
35:47;35:48;"He must."
35:48;35:50;"He creates everything."
35:50;35:51;"Yeah, but we can't expect--"
35:51;35:54;"It's like one of those funny things where I turn to them and say like,"
35:54;35:57;"""Oh, hey guys, by the way, this is Patrick."""
35:57;35:59;"I'm like, ""Hey,"" and I was like, ""So--"
35:59;36:00;"Yeah, in fact, I don't think they were TCS."""
36:00;36:01;"That's a lot of backstory."
36:01;36:03;"I was like, ""You know I do this radio show,"" and they're like, ""Oh, okay."""
36:03;36:07;"And I was like, ""So on the radio show, Patrick, I've never met him before,"
36:07;36:11;"but he's a listener who will send us in parodies, songs based on--"""
36:11;36:14;"They're just kind of like, ""Okay."""
36:14;36:16;"Yeah, a lot of inside jokes from our show."
36:16;36:21;"You know, Lonnie's dad, Lord Hadaway, things of that nature."
36:21;36:23;"They look around and Patrick's nowhere to be seen."
36:23;36:24;"No, I swear he was--"
36:24;36:26;"Yeah, he was just there."
36:26;36:29;"No, but shout out to Patrick and his wife who came through."
36:29;36:35;"Wow, it sounds like the East Coast is really like some big TC icons were in the mix."
36:35;36:36;"Well, and then there was--"
36:36;36:37;"Winter and Patrick."
36:37;36:42;"There was a Twitter exchange later where Winter and Patrick were making plans to link up."
36:42;36:43;"Did you see that?"
36:43;36:44;"Oh, actually I did."
36:44;36:45;"That is sick."
36:45;36:46;"I'm not lying."
36:46;36:49;"The TC world is--it's really a family."
36:49;36:56;"You know, the next step would be people starting to date, like TC fan community."
36:56;36:58;"You know, they'd be like, ""Hey, anyone else a TC head?"
36:58;37:02;"I'm looking to meet someone."""
37:02;37:07;"Wait, I told you how like a while ago I got a bunch of old issues of Relics on eBay,"
37:07;37:09;"like some '80s Relics."
37:09;37:10;"Wow."
37:10;37:12;"So, you know, Relics still exists."
37:12;37:13;"It's a great news source."
37:13;37:16;"They did a big Vampire Weekend cover story this year."
37:16;37:17;"I got to check that out."
37:17;37:18;"Yeah, it was tight."
37:18;37:24;"Yeah, I love talking to the journalist who also wrote or co-wrote Bill Kreutzman's memoirs."
37:24;37:25;"Oh, that's sick."
37:25;37:32;"But I remember looking through one of them, and there were, you know, like wan ads and personals in the back."
37:32;37:36;"And they're literally--I know this sounds like so kooky, but I wish I could say verbatim,"
37:36;37:41;"but I remember seeing some--so it might be everything from people being like looking to trade tapes,"
37:41;37:43;"you know, that kind of stuff."
37:43;37:47;"But then I remember seeing some personal ads, and I remember they were like some were so hyper-specific,"
37:47;37:51;"just like looking for ladies who are also deadheads."
37:51;37:53;"And like some of them were so hyper-specific."
37:53;38:00;"I remember a guy who's like looking for like a deadhead lady, you know, age, whatever,"
38:00;38:02;"somebody who leans towards pre-'72 stuff."
38:02;38:03;"That's important to me."
38:03;38:06;"It was like literally like that kind of thing."
38:06;38:08;"It's so deep."
38:08;38:13;"I guess it's also possible that if this was the '80s--I can't remember when this issue was--"
38:13;38:15;"maybe he just wanted to make sure he wasn't getting a touch head."
38:15;38:16;"Sure, sure."
38:16;38:20;"Which are people who got on board with their breakout single ""Touch of Gray."""
38:20;38:21;"In '87."
38:21;38:24;"So like what years were these magazines you were buying?"
38:24;38:25;"Some of them were from the '80s."
38:25;38:26;"Like late '80s, early '90s?"
38:26;38:27;"I'll bring some in."
38:27;38:28;"Why did you get them?"
38:28;38:30;"Just out of curiosity?"
38:30;38:32;"I mean I've always been interested in relics."
38:32;38:34;"It's like a magazine I would see around, but not '80s relics."
38:34;38:37;"I would see it at best for me maybe in the late '90s."
38:37;38:40;"And I think I would see--I would just see like cool people."
38:40;38:43;"Like some cool Deadhead t-shirt people, like post-relics."
38:43;38:46;"And I would see them post their collection of vintage ones."
38:46;38:50;"I was like, ""Ooh, I want to see what's inside that 1985 relic."""
38:50;38:52;"That is so deep."
38:52;38:55;"So I bought like three or four that I got for decent prices."
38:55;38:57;"Are they expensive, sort of?"
38:57;38:59;"I didn't find any dirt cheap."
38:59;39:00;"I got a hundred relics."
39:00;39:03;"Hey, if you take them off my hands for $10, I'm happy."
39:03;39:04;"No, it's more like, you know."
39:04;39:07;"Like probably some of them cost like $10."
39:07;39:08;"Okay, yeah."
39:08;39:11;"It wasn't like--well, yeah, I wasn't dropping like $150 for a pristine copy."
39:11;39:13;"But, you know, like--"
39:13;39:15;"Near mint, mint."
39:15;39:16;"Yeah."
39:16;39:18;"But I'll bring them in because they're fascinating."
39:18;39:22;"And also there's something nice about--at that era, it's like in between a zine"
39:22;39:23;"and a professional magazine."
39:23;39:26;"There's like a handmade quality to some of the stuff inside."
39:26;39:30;"But I also just like love thinking about this dude just like mid-'80s."
39:30;39:34;"Like at first I wonder what kind of responses he got."
39:34;39:37;"And I'm also picturing somebody just like, ""Hey, man, like, you know what?"
39:37;39:41;"I also live in Westchester, and I happen to see that."
39:41;39:42;"I've been looking to meet a Deadhead, too."""
39:42;39:46;"And then like they link up, and he's just like immediately just like full jeush bag,"
39:46;39:47;"just like quizzing her."
39:47;39:48;"Just like--"
39:48;39:50;"So '74, how do you feel?"
39:50;39:51;"Yeah."
39:51;39:53;"Okay."
39:53;39:57;"What's the best Mr. Charlie of '72?"
39:57;39:59;"And you can't say the one on Europe '72."
39:59;40:01;"And she's like, ""I don't know, man."
40:01;40:05;"I like--I like touch of gray, like Uncle John's man."""
40:05;40:07;"He's just like, ""Get the f--- out of here."""
40:07;40:08;"This is not going to work."
40:09;40:10;"I'm looking for happiness."
40:10;40:11;"Can't you tell?"
40:11;40:12;"Yeah."
40:12;40:16;"She's just like beautiful hippie chick."
40:16;40:19;"Yeah, just somewhat familiar."
40:19;40:20;"""Oh, no, I haven't heard that."
40:20;40:25;"No, I'd love to learn more about some of like the '74 bootlegs."""
40:25;40:28;"And he's like, ""Well, get back to me when you do."""
40:28;40:31;"You wasted both of our time."
40:31;40:34;"Anyway, the TC personals wouldn't be like that."
40:34;40:35;"Colin just showed me something."
40:35;40:36;"Where was it?"
40:36;40:37;"It was on Reddit."
40:37;40:38;"Wait, is it on the TC Reddit?"
40:38;40:40;"The TC Reddit, which I never look at, but--"
40:40;40:42;"Oh, yeah, is the TC Reddit popping?"
40:42;40:43;"Oh, nice."
40:43;40:46;"Subject had New York-based TC heads."
40:46;40:49;"""Hey, I'm visiting New York for work October 6 to 8"
40:49;40:52;"and wondering if any TC heads wanted to get a drink."
40:52;40:54;"I'm 25, into corporate food history,"
40:54;40:57;"jam bands, and visiting Starbucks."""
40:57;40:59;"Response, ""Suburban New Yorker here."
40:59;41:00;"Let's get a coffee."""
41:00;41:01;"Oh, that's sick."
41:01;41:02;"That's sweet."
41:02;41:03;"Wait, what?"
41:03;41:05;"It was a 25-year-old man?"
41:05;41:06;"Oh, that's cool."
41:06;41:07;"Yeah, there's no--"
41:07;41:09;"It's kind of post-gender, just like--"
41:09;41:10;"This is about the show."
41:10;41:12;"Oh, this is just about linking up."
41:12;41:15;"Yeah, it's not a dating inquiry."
41:15;41:17;"Yeah, you know, maybe that's better, too."
41:17;41:18;"Yeah, it's better."
41:18;41:20;"People bring too much energy and expectation"
41:20;41:21;"to romantic relationships."
41:21;41:23;"Well, that's how something could really happen, though."
41:23;41:25;"It's like two TC heads."
41:25;41:27;"They're just there to talk about the show, maybe connect."
41:27;41:30;"And then, you know, one thing leads to another, maybe."
41:30;41:31;"But if you just go in like,"
41:31;41:33;"""Hey, we're just talking about the show,"""
41:33;41:34;"no presh."
41:34;41:35;"Yeah, it's just a meet-up."
41:35;41:37;"There was one time earlier this year,"
41:37;41:40;"I believe it was after our Cincinnati show,"
41:40;41:45;"a young woman DM'd me on Instagram and said like,"
41:45;41:49;"""Listen, I was sitting next to this guy at the show,"
41:49;41:50;"and we really hit it off,"
41:50;41:53;"and we were talking about this, this, and this."""
41:53;41:54;"We had good sense--"
41:54;41:55;"They might have been TC heads."
41:55;41:57;"I don't remember, but they were like--"
41:57;41:58;"We were like joking around."
41:58;42:00;"He's like a medical student at the University of Cincinnati,"
42:00;42:01;"blah, blah, blah."
42:01;42:03;"I really regret that I didn't ask for his number."
42:03;42:05;"I was like being too shy or something."
42:05;42:06;"Can you help me out?"
42:06;42:10;"And then I was like, ""I mean, I guess."""
42:10;42:11;"Yeah, what do you do?"
42:11;42:14;"I was like, ""If you can condense this into one post,"
42:14;42:17;"I'll throw it on my IG stories."""
42:17;42:20;"So she made like a pretty well-designed little like,"
42:20;42:21;"""Hey, what's up?"""
42:21;42:23;"You know, she was using Futura and stuff."
42:23;42:25;"Yeah, Miss Connections, Cincinnati show."
42:25;42:27;"And I posted it, and I got a lot of response."
42:27;42:28;"I'd be like, ""Oh, that's so sweet."""
42:28;42:31;"I would feel like in this day and age,"
42:31;42:34;"somebody--it wouldn't be that hard to figure out."
42:34;42:35;"I wonder if they ever linked up."
42:35;42:37;"Yeah."
42:37;42:38;"I kind of feel like if they had,"
42:38;42:41;"then you would have gotten like a follow-up from her."
42:41;42:43;"A wedding invitation."
42:43;42:44;"But I agree."
42:44;42:45;"Romantic relationships."
42:45;42:47;"I was expecting."
42:47;42:49;"TC, baby."
42:49;42:50;"I'm just going deep on this subreddit."
42:50;42:53;"Did you know that during the Apple iPhone release,"
42:53;42:56;"there was an Apple Watch video with a VO by Michael Cera"
42:56;42:58;"with Sympathy as the back--"
42:58;42:59;"Oh, yeah, of course."
42:59;43:00;"Wild."
43:00;43:01;"I missed that."
43:01;43:03;"Yeah, unrelated to time crisis."
43:03;43:04;"I got you."
43:04;43:05;"There was like some message on Twitter that was like,"
43:05;43:07;"""Is that part of your time crisis deal?"""
43:07;43:11;"And I was like, ""How dare you?"""
43:11;43:14;"These are independent branches of the organization."
43:14;43:17;"Yeah, Sympathy is in an Apple Watch commercial."
43:17;43:18;"That's so modern."
43:18;43:20;"I haven't seen it in full,"
43:20;43:23;"and I didn't know that Michael Cera was going to do the voiceover,"
43:23;43:24;"but that's tight."
43:24;43:26;"Yeah, I think it premiered at the keynote,"
43:26;43:28;"but I don't know if it's on TV yet."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah, I can't find it anywhere."
43:30;43:31;"Anyway, check it out."
43:31;43:33;"Seinfeld's down the rabbit hole in that Reddit."
43:33;43:34;"Yeah, I got to close this window."
43:34;43:36;"Yeah, I can see like your eyes are glazing over."
43:36;43:38;"You need to get out of there."
43:38;43:42;"Reddit, that's the Reddit, you know, it just sucks you in."
43:42;43:44;"Suddenly it's nighttime."
43:44;43:45;"You're just on Reddit all day."
43:45;43:54;"""Master thread for determining Seinfeld 2000's address."""
43:54;43:56;"I wonder if there's any, like, TC loyalists"
43:56;43:58;"who, like, still see you as a villain."
43:58;44:00;"Because when you first came on the show,"
44:00;44:04;"you were definitely a bit of a villain."
44:04;44:06;"Yeah, people are confused by that narrative."
44:06;44:09;"That's one of the most classic narratives of all time."
44:09;44:10;"Foe becomes friend."
44:10;44:12;"It's true."
44:12;44:14;"It was a character evolution."
44:14;44:16;"It was some pro wrestling sh*t."
44:16;44:17;"That's right."
44:17;44:19;"Eventually, though, there's going to be the fallout."
44:19;44:21;"There could be the fallout."
44:21;44:22;"Seinfeld gets banished."
44:22;44:26;"Yeah, we should create more storylines for this show."
44:26;44:29;"We just bring in just like some real dweeb"
44:29;44:34;"who's just like, ""World's biggest Friends fan."""
44:34;44:37;"I am interested in hearing about how the Rembrandts"
44:37;44:39;"feel about the 25th anniversary of Friends,"
44:39;44:41;"which is now, right?"
44:41;44:44;"Anyway, why am I talking about this?"
44:44;44:45;"You're kind of excited."
44:45;44:48;"I mean, at a certain point, old rivalries,"
44:48;44:50;"they kind of collapse."
44:50;44:52;"You know, it's kind of like when you're talking about,"
44:52;44:55;"like, imagine two 85-year-olds"
44:55;44:58;"fought on opposing sides of a war."
44:58;44:59;"They both make it to 85."
44:59;45:01;"They're sitting at a cafe."
45:01;45:04;"They've both seen the way that time ravages everybody,"
45:04;45:07;"the winners, the losers."
45:07;45:09;"They both have lost so many people."
45:09;45:11;"They're both the last men standing from their platoon."
45:11;45:14;"They look at each other, former enemies,"
45:14;45:16;"and they're just kind of like,"
45:16;45:18;"""Hey, man, let me buy you that cup of coffee."
45:18;45:22;"""I hated your guts. I wanted to kill you, but now we're--"""
45:22;45:24;"I mean, it's real sh--. Actually, it's very moving."
45:24;45:27;"I've spoken highly of the Ken Burns Vietnam doc."
45:27;45:29;"You ever crack that, Jake?"
45:29;45:31;"Didn't get through it. It's awesome."
45:31;45:34;"The beginning's tough. The beginning's tough."
45:34;45:36;"That's on me."
45:36;45:38;"It's a major investment in the beginning,"
45:38;45:40;"but when you get to the end, they talk, too,"
45:40;45:44;"about a lot of these American soldiers"
45:44;45:46;"who were so young."
45:46;45:49;"These were very young adults when they rolled over there."
45:49;45:51;"Some of them who probably drank the Kool-Aid"
45:51;45:54;"or believed they were fighting a necessary battle"
45:54;45:56;"have a lot of questions later."
45:56;45:59;"And they talk about it, some of these dudes roll back to Vietnam."
45:59;46:02;"It's haunted them their whole lives, PTSD, whatever."
46:02;46:05;"And they talk about that there's a not-uncommon thing,"
46:05;46:09;"is that Northern Vietnamese soldiers and North Vietnamese won,"
46:09;46:11;"so the whole country is--"
46:11;46:15;"They're returning to the country where the victors beat the U.S.,"
46:15;46:18;"and now some of these American soldiers"
46:18;46:21;"will go link up with dudes who are on the opposing side,"
46:21;46:25;"and there is this weird shared camaraderie of kind of like--"
46:25;46:27;"I don't think the Northern Vietnamese soldiers are like,"
46:27;46:29;"""You know what, man?"""
46:29;46:31;"Water under the bridge."
46:31;46:34;"U.S. imperialism, capitalism, it's all the same."
46:34;46:35;"It's all good, man."
46:35;46:37;"I do think there is some weird shared thing"
46:37;46:39;"where they're just kind of like,"
46:39;46:42;"""We were both on-the-ground soldiers in a larger thing."
46:42;46:45;"I don't hate you. We both shared a traumatic experience."""
46:45;46:48;"Probably not forgiving the U.S. as an entity."
46:48;46:51;"Oh, yeah, like we were both cannon fodder."
46:51;46:54;"Yeah, and even some of these guys probably realizing the way"
46:54;46:57;"that their worldview was morphed by the--"
46:57;46:59;"So anyway, it's like this kind of moving thing"
46:59;47:03;"where some of these dudes who probably wouldn't have dreamed of it"
47:03;47:05;"are there, and it feels cathartic to them"
47:05;47:09;"to be like, ""We were both victims of violence."""
47:09;47:12;"Actually, now I just remember what we were talking about."
47:12;47:14;"Yeah, just me defending--"
47:14;47:16;"This is like a bad TC rabbit hole"
47:16;47:18;"where I actually jumped to something way too deep,"
47:18;47:20;"and now it's actually insulting to go back"
47:20;47:22;"to what we were originally talking about,"
47:22;47:24;"which is friends versus Seinfeld."
47:24;47:26;"Oops. Apologies."
47:26;47:29;"But I'm saying that I think time collapses everything,"
47:29;47:31;"and when I picture the old heads--"
47:31;47:34;"I've given this example before in Keith Richards' book"
47:34;47:37;"how he talks about he and Paul McCartney"
47:37;47:39;"staying on the same Caribbean island,"
47:39;47:41;"like staying in two villas next to each other,"
47:41;47:43;"and just kind of hitting them up, just like,"
47:43;47:45;"""Yo, man, you want to go for a walk?"""
47:45;47:48;"And he's like, ""Me and Paul just walked on the beach,"
47:48;47:50;"and we just talked about the old days, man."""
47:50;47:52;"And obviously, the Beatles versus the Stones"
47:52;47:54;"is not the same intensity as--"
47:54;47:56;"Friends versus Seinfeld."
47:56;48:00;"Friends versus Seinfeld, let alone North Vietnam versus the U.S.,"
48:00;48:03;"but the way he talked about it was kind of just like,"
48:03;48:05;"""We used to be competitive."""
48:05;48:07;"I don't know if he quite says it, but you can imagine"
48:07;48:10;"Keith Richards probably thought McCartney was a bit of a cornball."
48:10;48:11;"Mm-hmm."
48:11;48:14;"Keith Richards was the badass of the badass crew,"
48:14;48:16;"and Paul McCartney was kind of like the sweetheart"
48:16;48:18;"of, like, the sweet crew."
48:18;48:21;"So, you know, in many ways, they're diametric opposites."
48:21;48:24;"But the way he frames it is a little bit just like,"
48:24;48:27;"""Yeah, two grizzled soldiers. We're both still standing,"
48:27;48:29;"and actually we have more in common with each other"
48:29;48:31;"because we remember."
48:31;48:34;"We remember the past. We've seen good men die."
48:34;48:38;"John Lennon, George Harrison, Brian Jones."""
48:38;48:40;"So there's, like, this slight--"
48:40;48:42;"Actually, I should go back to that passage."
48:42;48:44;"I wonder if he uses any soldier imagery."
48:44;48:46;"But we had this feeling of just kind of like"
48:46;48:48;"the fact that we're both still standing"
48:48;48:51;"and that we both even remember this battle"
48:51;48:54;"or this time period unites us in a way"
48:54;48:57;"that even, like, our children couldn't understand."
48:57;48:59;"So anyway, I think that's starting to happen"
48:59;49:02;"with ""Seinfeld 2000,"" where you've been fighting"
49:02;49:05;"this battle for so long, that one day--"
49:05;49:08;"And look, now you even see, like, ""Friends"" is getting canceled."
49:08;49:10;"- No, what?"
49:10;49:12;"- ""Friends"" is the most popular show on Netflix."
49:12;49:14;"I just thought there was some kind of clickbait article"
49:14;49:16;"that was like, ""Why 'Friends' is actually trash."""
49:16;49:18;"- Yeah, there's been a backlash."
49:18;49:20;"A lot of think pieces about the 25th anniversary"
49:20;49:22;"and how, you know, we're rethinking ""Friends"""
49:22;49:24;"and all the rest of it. I mean, we all already--"
49:24;49:26;"A lot of us knew that ""Friends"" was trash"
49:26;49:28;"from the jump. - Yeah, but people do that"
49:28;49:31;"with ""Seinfeld"" too, but ""Seinfeld"" got more heat"
49:31;49:33;"earlier maybe because ""Seinfeld""--"
49:33;49:35;"""Seinfeld"" was a bigger target maybe"
49:35;49:38;"because it actually existed in this more intelligent circle."
49:38;49:41;"- Why did people say ""Seinfeld"" was trash?"
49:41;49:43;"- I just think, like, to some people, represent, like--"
49:43;49:46;"Well, people talked about, like, ""Seinfeld"" being very white."
49:46;49:48;"- Yeah, that's true. Yeah."
49:48;49:50;"And, you know, Larry David references it a lot"
49:50;49:53;"on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" and..."
49:53;49:55;"Anyway. - All I'm saying is"
49:55;49:58;"that I bet there's a part of you that sees"
49:58;50:00;"the, you know, ""Friends"" backlash,"
50:00;50:02;"and you're just kind of like, ""Man,"
50:02;50:04;"""at the end of the day,"
50:04;50:07;"""we're both fighting a forgotten war"
50:07;50:10;"""for NBC's must-see TV"
50:10;50:12;"mid-'90s block."" - I do not feel that way."
50:12;50:14;"- And I can just kind of-- Okay. - No."
50:14;50:16;"- I just think-- No, you're not there yet,"
50:16;50:17;"but I'm picturing, like, in 20 years."
50:17;50:19;"- No, I'll never be there. - We're sitting here,"
50:19;50:21;"and you have, like-- It's, like, really retro"
50:21;50:23;"and cool to be into ""Riverdale."""
50:23;50:25;"- [laughs]"

50:31;50:33;"""I don't even know what the f--- you're talking about."""
50:33;50:35;"And you'll look at, like, some ""Friends"" fanatic,"

50:43;50:45;"we wouldn't even have to have that conversation,"
50:45;50:48;"and that's a mission that I'm still kind of"
50:48;50:50;"dedicated to, so we'll see."

51:20;51:22;"on Beat Squad."
51:22;51:25;"- So, Yvelon Goria with this ""Flaming Hot Cheetos"" film."
51:25;51:27;"- Anyway. - It's pretty cool."
51:27;51:29;"- So, we've been talking about Richard Montanez for a minute,"
51:29;51:33;"and because I follow him on Instagram,"
51:33;51:34;"I've known that he's been working on"
51:34;51:37;"developing a film for a long time, years."
51:37;51:40;"Last time I checked, his account is private,"
51:40;51:43;"so you have to be accepted into the inner circle"
51:43;51:45;"to get to follow him, but he's always been very open"
51:45;51:47;"about the fact, like, ""Oh, yeah, I was in L.A."
51:47;51:49;"""doing a meeting, looks like things are gonna happen,"""
51:49;51:52;"and now finally, it reaches the mainstream"
51:52;51:55;"with the announcement that Yvelon Goria is gonna direct it."
51:55;51:57;"One thing I'd like to say is we've tried to get"
51:57;51:59;"Montanez on the show many times."
51:59;52:02;"So, Seinfeld, you kind of spearheaded that initiative."
52:02;52:04;"How'd you fuck that one up?"
52:04;52:06;"- Oh, well, no, I didn't-- - What happened?"
52:06;52:08;"- I didn't fuck it, I made a valiant effort to--"
52:08;52:10;"- You had one job. - Well, listen,"
52:10;52:13;"Montanez does not want to be on this show,"
52:13;52:15;"straight up, let's just say that."
52:15;52:18;"He was speaking at some sort of corporate event,"
52:18;52:20;"and I went through the promoters, and I went through the thing,"
52:20;52:22;"and it came--you know, it went back to him,"
52:22;52:24;"and it was just a note from him."
52:24;52:26;"And I think we've also been trying to go through--"
52:26;52:29;"- But did you say it was time crisis with Ezra and Jake?"
52:29;52:31;"- Yeah, I led with--I did the whole thing."
52:31;52:33;"I said, you know, you can-- - But did you start out saying,"
52:33;52:35;"""Hey, I'm Seinfeld 2000,"" maybe they were just like, ""Eh."""
52:35;52:38;"- No, no, no, I did it, like, as my real, like--"
52:38;52:40;"I used my real name. - He's probably like,"
52:40;52:42;"""Oh, yeah, Seinfeld 2000, I don't like that guy."""
52:42;52:44;"- No, no, no, everybody loves-- - He caused a lot of trouble"
52:44;52:46;"in the early days of TC. - No, no."
52:46;52:49;"No, no, no, it's a beloved-- it's a beloved Internet presence"
52:49;52:53;"that really everybody wants to be tapped into."
52:53;52:56;"But no, he--I think that he was actually"
52:56;52:59;"just saving the IP for this film."
52:59;53:01;"That's my theory. He's like, ""I'm not gonna do interviews."
53:01;53:03;"I'm not gonna do press."
53:03;53:05;"Let's have Eva Longoria handle this story with a tender."""
53:05;53:08;"- Or to be fair, to be fair, maybe he's like--"
53:08;53:10;"he gets paid to fly around the world to tell his story."
53:10;53:12;"He goes to colleges."
53:12;53:15;"He gives kind of inspirational talks at corporations."
53:15;53:18;"Maybe his vibe is like, ""I don't need to do press per se."
53:18;53:21;"I'm out there telling my story, and I'm being rewarded for it."""
53:21;53:24;"So I could imagine, you know, he's talking at a college"
53:24;53:26;"or something, he's getting his speaker's fee,"
53:26;53:29;"and we're like, ""You want to just come do some press?"""
53:29;53:31;"He's like, ""Why?"" - Right, yeah, and I think"
53:31;53:33;"he knows that you're kind of like, uh..."
53:33;53:36;"I don't know, like, maybe you'll make fun of him."
53:36;53:38;"Like, maybe this isn't a safe space for--"
53:38;53:40;"- I don't make fun of people. - Well, not make fun of--"
53:40;53:42;"but he knows that you're like, maybe sometimes--"
53:42;53:45;"- Maybe he knows that I associate with people like a Seinfeld 2000."
53:45;53:47;"- Right. - Kind of mean-spirited."
53:47;53:49;"- No, there's nothing-- - Kind of snarky."
53:49;53:51;"- No, no, no, no, like, um..."
53:51;53:54;"What I'm saying is that maybe he's heard some of the show,"
53:54;53:56;"and he thinks, ""Well, this is a little tongue-in-cheek, maybe,"
53:56;53:59;"about the craft of, um, these Cheetos,"
53:59;54:01;"which I've devoted my life to, and I don't want this--"
54:01;54:03;"- Right, he hears us talking about Frito-Lay Corporation,"
54:03;54:05;"and he's like, ""I don't know what to make of this."""
54:05;54:07;"- Maybe. - He heard the Donald Kendall segment."
54:07;54:10;"- Maybe he's heard our-- yeah, your takes on Brad's drink"
54:10;54:14;"and whatnot, and just, ""I don't want this Ezra ripping into my--"
54:14;54:16;"my--my--"" - Although, I will say one thing."
54:16;54:19;"Sorry to brag."
54:19;54:23;"Forgive me, Lord, but I'm about to brag."
54:23;54:26;"- Is this gonna be a humble brag or, like, a full-on brag?"
54:26;54:29;"- This is a full-on brag. - Uh-huh."
54:29;54:32;"- Lord, forgive me, but I'm going back to the old me."
54:32;54:35;"I try to tame my ego,"
54:35;54:38;"but sometimes I can't keep it in check."
54:38;54:40;"- Oh, my God."
54:40;54:42;"- Lord, forgive me. Here we go."
54:42;54:44;"So I followed him for a long time,"
54:44;54:46;"even when he was private, and you needed him"
54:46;54:48;"to personally approve you."
54:48;54:50;"- He still is private. - Oh, he still is private."
54:50;54:52;"- With 63,000 followers. - Wow."
54:52;54:54;"- What a piece of [bleep]"
54:54;54:56;"- What? - No, no."
54:56;54:59;"No, no, I mean, like, not--not really."
54:59;55:02;"- Do you think he's personally going through and, like, okaying?"
55:02;55:05;"- Absolutely. - I take that back, Richard."
55:05;55:07;"That was--if you're listening. - See, Seinfeld, you're--"
55:07;55:09;"- Man. - I'm still--"
55:09;55:11;"- So anyway, here's my brag. - Cut that. Cut that."
55:11;55:13;"- Here's my brag."
55:13;55:15;"- Seinfeld's going--I mean-- - See, you know what--"
55:15;55:18;"- Episode 101 starts the decline of Seinfeld."
55:18;55:20;"- Yeah. - We're slowly building the story."
55:20;55:23;"- Right. - By episode 120, he's off the show."
55:23;55:25;"- Making a lot of edibies."
55:25;55:28;"- From episode 9 to 100, Seinfeld was rehabilitated,"
55:28;55:31;"brought back into the fold."
55:31;55:34;"From 101 to 150..."
55:34;55:36;"- A dark spiral."
55:36;55:39;"- One of the most precipitous falls from grace"
55:39;55:41;"ever recorded on an Internet radio show."
55:41;55:43;"- Seth Meyers, if you're listening,"
55:43;55:45;"I was also joking earlier"
55:45;55:48;"when I told you to go [bleep] yourself."
55:48;55:51;"- Episode 101 to 150 is called"
55:51;55:54;"""The Rise of Winter and the Fall of Seinfeld."""
55:54;55:57;"- People thought I was Winter at MSG."
55:57;55:59;"They're like, ""Yo, Winter."" - Really?"
55:59;56:01;"- Yeah, I'm like, ""Come on."""
56:01;56:04;"Anyway... [laughter]"
56:04;56:06;"You guys can be, like, cousins."
56:06;56:09;"Oh, I was about to brag."
56:09;56:12;"One time--and this is also--"
56:12;56:14;"you know what's funny about this too?"
56:14;56:17;"Is it's like, Richard Montanez reminds me of Jay-Z."
56:17;56:20;"I've spoken on the show about how Jay-Z does this thing"
56:20;56:22;"where he maintains this kind of, like,"
56:22;56:24;"you know, very mysterious, like,"
56:24;56:26;"is this guy tucked away, and then he'll do things"
56:26;56:29;"just to remind people, ""I've always got my ear to the ground."
56:29;56:31;"I know what's going on."""
56:31;56:33;"Heard a lot of stories like that."
56:33;56:35;"I'm not--I'm not doing mild things."
56:35;56:37;"I'm not--nothing crazy, but just, like, that people--"
56:37;56:39;"you know, 'cause people probably wonder with a guy like Jay-Z."
56:39;56:41;"I mean, for all we know, he's an incredibly wealthy guy."
56:41;56:43;"For all we know, he's, like, semi-retired."
56:43;56:45;"But then he'll, like, always let people know, like,"
56:45;56:47;"""Oh, no, I noticed what you said."
56:47;56:49;"I noticed what you're doing."
56:49;56:51;"Um, I'm up on stuff."""
56:51;56:53;"And there's something about Richard Montanez"
56:53;56:55;"where I was kind of like, ""All right, this guy doesn't give a f---"
56:55;56:57;"about TC."" He probably just thought--he was like,"
56:57;56:59;"""What is this? I don't know who Vampire Weekend is."
56:59;57:01;"Seinfeld 2000 sounds like a real weirdo."""
57:01;57:03;"I wouldn't want to--I wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole."
57:03;57:05;"- I don't think he thought that at all. - So then I follow him,"
57:05;57:07;"and I'm just one of his many followers,"
57:07;57:09;"and I was kind of like, ""This guy's too busy."
57:09;57:11;"He's a major corporate figure, you know?"
57:11;57:13;"Like, what does he care about this stuff?"""
57:13;57:15;"And then out of nowhere, I posted an old picture."
57:15;57:17;"It probably was Father's Day."
57:17;57:19;"I posted this old black-and-white photo"
57:19;57:21;"of me and my dad."
57:21;57:23;"I'm a baby."
57:23;57:25;"My dad's, like, young, mid-30s,"
57:25;57:27;"in our apartment in New York."
57:27;57:29;"A little while after that, just out of nowhere,"
57:29;57:31;"I get a comment on it"
57:31;57:33;"from Hot Cheetos RPM,"
57:33;57:35;"Richard Montanez,"
57:35;57:37;"and just said,"
57:37;57:39;"""Cool pic."""
57:39;57:41;"Wow."
57:41;57:43;"And I was like, ""Whoa."" It felt like a very--"
57:43;57:45;"it was a very Jay-Z-esque move, just to be like--"
57:45;57:47;"you're all in your head like,"
57:47;57:49;"""This person even--"" and then just like this kind of"
57:49;57:51;"very mysterious, like, ""Oh, hey."
57:51;57:53;"I got my eye on you."""
57:53;57:55;"So of course I was thrilled, and I was like,"
57:55;57:57;"""Whatever,"" but, you know,"
57:57;57:59;"interesting."
57:59;58:01;"So he follows you back?"
58:01;58:03;"I-- wait, how do you know if somebody follows you back?"
58:03;58:05;"So you gotta look at their followers,"
58:05;58:07;"then you gotta type your own handle into their"
58:07;58:09;"list of followers to see if they're following you."
58:09;58:11;"What?"
58:11;58:13;"So you go to their, like, number,"
58:13;58:15;"like, ""Richard Montanez is following"
58:15;58:17;"400 people,"" whatever, then it goes to a list."
58:17;58:19;"I feel like I probably-- Oh, yeah, yeah, the list."
58:19;58:21;"There's, like, a search bar. He's only following"
58:21;58:23;"373 people."
58:23;58:25;"I was close. No, he doesn't follow me."
58:25;58:27;"Well, then how the hell did he end up--"
58:27;58:29;"He was just-- maybe he was just poking around."
58:29;58:31;"Maybe he saw me liking his pics."
58:31;58:33;"He might have popped up on the Explorer."
58:33;58:35;"And you have, like, a blue check verified thing."
58:35;58:37;"Yeah, so maybe he was like, ""Who is this dude?"" But I feel like it wasn't even,"
58:37;58:39;"like, that picture wasn't even new at the time."
58:39;58:41;"He might have been on the Explorer page."
58:41;58:43;"Maybe. He was swiping around on the"
58:43;58:45;"Explorer."
58:45;58:47;"Anyway, shout-out to Richard Montanez."
58:47;58:49;"I can't wait for this movie."
58:49;58:51;"Maybe we should see if we get Eva Longoria to call in."
58:51;58:53;"I think he could have really seized the opportunity"
58:53;58:55;"to respond to his comment, being like,"
58:55;58:57;"""Hey, man, come on to 'Time Crisis.' Like, we've been"
58:57;58:59;"trying so hard. Seinfeld's been doing everything"
58:59;59:01;"he can."" You know,"
59:01;59:03;"that would have been the moment to really--"
59:03;59:05;"""Hey, man, I'd love to."
59:05;59:07;"I don't like that Seinfeld guy."""
59:07;59:09;"[laughs] He's a friends guy."
59:09;59:11;"So, anyway, the film"
59:11;59:13;"tells the story of his life."
59:13;59:15;"The script will be written by Louis Kallek,"
59:15;59:17;"who wrote ""October Sky,"" ""Domestic Disturbance,"""
59:17;59:19;"and ""Charlie St. Cloud."""
59:19;59:21;"Longoria's directed episodes of shows like"
59:21;59:23;"""Jane the Virgin,"" ""Black-ish,"" and ""Grand Hotel,"""
59:23;59:25;"and she beat out multiple directors for the"
59:25;59:27;"job with her authentic approach to portraying the"
59:27;59:29;"inspiring story of Richard and Judy Montanez."
59:29;59:31;"I don't know that much about Judy."
59:31;59:33;"Is that his wife?"
59:33;59:35;"Probably. Assuming so."
59:35;59:37;"I wonder what it's gonna be called."
59:37;59:39;"Is it gonna be a Hot Cheeto pun?"
59:39;59:41;"It's called ""Flamin' Hot."" For real?"
59:41;59:43;"Yeah. I'm still curious"
59:43;59:45;"to see where the movie goes after the"
59:45;59:47;"invention of"
59:47;59:49;"the"
59:49;59:51;"Flamin' Hot Cheeto."
59:51;59:53;"There'll be a big build-up of, like, he's invented"
59:53;59:55;"the Cheeto, but he's just trying to get the Cheeto"
59:55;59:57;"across the desk"
59:57;59:59;"of the higher-ups at Frito-Lay."
59:59;01:00:01;"There's probably gonna be a lot of scenes"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"of, like, ""You're just a janitor."""
01:00:03;01:00:05;"Right. Well, yeah, I wonder"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"does he invent"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"the Flamin' Hot Cheeto in the first 20"
01:00:09;01:00:11;"minutes?"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Or is that big, like, towards the end?"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"'Cause there's a version where he"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"invents the-- I bet they're coming out of the gate"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"with him inventing it fast."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"That's my guess. Like a little bit of backstory."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"His immigration story."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"And then maybe from then on, it's about--"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Well, then he becomes probably a low-level"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"executive, so there's still him working"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"his way up the corporate ladder"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"dealing with the stigmas of"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"you know, being"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"a Hispanic immigrant, not your typical"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"Caucasian"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"American corporate dude, plus"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"his backstory as a janitor. So, yeah, I wonder if he"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"invents it and people are like, ""All right, this is doing pretty well."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"Montaigne is like--"" Yeah,"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"but, you know, don't get too excited."
01:00:49;01:00:51;"I guess it's also the larger story"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"is not just about Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"It's about building, like, the"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"whole Flamin' Hot empire within Frito-Lay's."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"I feel like he--"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"This is so deep."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"He posted something once that was about some other product"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"that they-- 'cause basically, there's a Flamin' Hot"
01:01:05;01:01:07;"version of almost anything you could think of."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"You know, like, it was a Flamin' Hot"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"cheddar popcorn or something, and he"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"was posted about how, like, when I first"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"pitched this, one of the food scientists"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"said it was impossible, and I was like,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"""Come on, let's make it happen."" Wait, let me see."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"I like that there's now, like, a small"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"genre of films pertaining to, like,"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"fast food and"

01:01:29;01:01:31;"film. Great film. Very dark."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"Very dark. Yeah."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"And then-- The Founder. The Founder, which"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"we saw in the theater together. Yep."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Pretty solid. I still think back on"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"that. Pretty solid movie. I wish it was a"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"tiny bit better because it's--"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"it's such a good story. Yeah. Yeah, I don't"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"know what-- that always pops into my head, like,"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"that part at the end when he says"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"to the McDonald Brothers, ""You know what I needed?"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"I needed your name."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Ray Kroc."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"What does that make people think of? Croc-a-sh*t."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"McDonald's."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"That's an all-American name. That's what I"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"needed. I don't know, it just made a big impression on me."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"I feel like I thought of that recently"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"for some reason. It is a good"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"movie, and it's just like--"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"I wish it was R instead of PG-13."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"There's just a--"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"There's a version of it that could have been"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"""There Will Be Blood."" Oh, absolutely."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"It's so-- Ruthless capitalism."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"It echoes ""There Will Be Blood"" in so many"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"ways. Nick Offerman is"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"one of the McDonald's brothers. Right."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"And I think that character actor,"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"John Carroll Lynch-- Is the other guy?"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Is the other one? Oh, yeah, he's a great actor."
01:02:31;01:02:33;"I see him around Eagle Rock."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"Oh, really? I went in a"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"few weeks ago."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"I popped into the Chipotle."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"Oh, yeah? He was in Chipotle? And he was doing a"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"dine-in at Chipotle with his"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"daughter. Really?"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"What's his name? John Carroll Lynch? John Carroll Lynch."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"This is like TMZ. And I was like,"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"""This is--"" I was so excited. I was texting Hannah."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"I was like, ""Dude, John Carroll Lynch."" 'Cause we had"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"seen him at a diner down the street"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"from our house. Yeah. I'm like, ""Dude, that's the"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"guy from Fargo and Zodiac and all this."""
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Oh, yeah, Fargo. Yeah. And then"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"seeing him doing the dine-in at"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"1 p.m. at the Chipotle."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"I mean, I was getting the"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"burrito to go. Yeah. Imagine if you were just"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"like, ""Yo, Lynch."" And he kind of looked"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"over and you were just like, ""Chipotle? Really?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"I thought you'd be at McDonald's."""
01:03:15;01:03:17;"I bet he fully"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"wouldn't get it. What do you mean?"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"What the f*ck are you talking about? I mean, I figured"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"you of all people should be at McDonald's for"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"lunch, not Chipotle. And you'd just be like,"
01:03:25;01:03:27;"""Why would-- What does that mean? Why would I be"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"at McDonald's?"" You'd be like, ""Because you were"

01:03:31;01:03:33;"""The Founder"" about McDonald's."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"And then he'd be like, ""Oh, okay. I'm sorry."
01:03:35;01:03:37;"You came in. I had no idea what you were"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"talking about. Yeah. Okay. Right. Right."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"That was with Michael Keaton. Yeah, yeah. That was a few years ago."""
01:03:41;01:03:43;"I thought you were talking about that McDonald's"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"used to own Chipotle, then they sold"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Chipotle. I thought"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"we were talking about some corporate food history. Yeah."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"Don't you host ""Time Crisis""? Right."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Time Crisis."
01:03:53;01:03:55;"I just ate McDonald's."

01:04:23;01:04:25;"""Flamin' Hot"" is going to be R-rated?"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"No. It sounds like feel-good, PG kind of thing."
01:04:27;01:04:29;"It sounds very-- Yeah."
01:04:29;01:04:31;"It's a family film. This is a post"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"that Montanya's made in June,"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"and it's for"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"""Chester's Flamin' Hot Popcorn."""
01:04:37;01:04:39;"I don't see this around."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Well, or I just wouldn't notice it"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"because I don't eat a lot of popcorn."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"Or raisins. Or raisins."
01:04:45;01:04:47;"[laughing]"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"""Flamin' Hot Popcorn and Raisins""?"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"Hey, I think we're onto something."
01:04:51;01:04:53;"So he says that ""Chester's Flamin' Hot Popcorn,"""
01:04:53;01:04:55;"this is the third product"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"right after ""Hot Fritos."""
01:04:57;01:04:59;"That also makes me think that when he probably"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"thinks back to his story, it's like,"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"""Yeah, 'Flamin' Hot Cheetos' is the beginning."""
01:05:03;01:05:05;"And then he has to painfully break through"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"the bullsh-- of corporate America."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"Yeah. For all we know, it's kind of like"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"making ""Flamin' Hot Fritos"""
01:05:11;01:05:13;"is like its whole other story."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"So he thinks about it this way."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"The third thing he made"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"was ""Flamin' Hot Popcorn."""
01:05:19;01:05:21;"This one almost didn't make it. Sales were low,"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"and no one had ever thought popcorn should be anything"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"but butter. This is a time"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"before popcorn-flavored stores were around."
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Innovation is making something better."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"The Barrio and Hood are full of innovation. Don't stop."
01:05:31;01:05:33;"RPM."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"Yeah, I feel like there's also a genre of film"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"that's like, ""I'm a genius, and I've created"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"something, and no one will listen."""
01:05:39;01:05:41;"Right. And like, the drama of the film"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"will be like getting people to like"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"understand his vision."
01:05:45;01:05:47;"There's like ""Lincoln,"""
01:05:47;01:05:49;"the Steven Spielberg film ""Lincoln."""
01:05:49;01:05:51;"Yeah. One thing I liked about that that I thought"
01:05:51;01:05:53;"was very smart about that movie is that"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"obviously Lincoln, you could tell the whole story"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"of his life. There's famous moments of his life."
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Lincoln-Douglas debates. Yep."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"His boyhood wrestling."
01:06:01;01:06:03;"You could tell the whole story of his life, but he chose to focus"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"on this very specific moment"
01:06:05;01:06:07;"where he's basically gathering votes."
01:06:07;01:06:09;"So I like the fact that it zeroed in on something"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"inherently, not"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"just political in the broad sense, but like"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"dealing with the bureaucracy"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"of politics. Right. So it was literally"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"a succession episode"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"or something. Yeah, yeah. Where it's like literally"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"counting the votes. Do we have the strength?"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"So there's something cool about that because you got to see this famous"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"guy just in his element."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"So maybe there could be something Lincoln-esque about this story too"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"that's just about like... Just convincing people"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"through sheer will."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"Like maybe getting into the weeds. That's just like"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"why was it hard to green light this?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"And he's like, ""That'd be sick if it's like the kind of movie"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"where it's like... In 1982"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"the board of Frito-Lay was seven people."
01:06:43;01:06:45;"Four were that, you know, like, boom, boom."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Oh, it was like the big short kind of vibe."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"That would be so tight."
01:06:49;01:06:51;"I have a feeling"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"it's probably a little more like feel good, but"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"that'd be sick too."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"Will definitely be a TC field trip when that movie"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"premieres. Oh yeah, we'll be keeping our eyes on"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Flamin' Hot."
01:07:05;01:07:09;"I'm silly, it's no fun In the old days, I'm such a romantic"
01:07:09;01:07:16;"I never remember, how things really happen I guess you're attractive or something"
01:07:16;01:07:23;"Live in the moment, that's what they tell me But whatever happened, to when you would hold me"
01:07:23;01:07:28;"And hold me and hold me Girlfriend, a girl that's a friend"
01:07:28;01:07:32;"It's easy just to pretend that we don't have something real"
01:07:32;01:07:41;"It's just how we feel We feel"
01:07:41;01:07:52;"Oh, it's just how we feel How we feel"
01:07:52;01:08:06;"I'm feeling something right"
01:08:06;01:08:19;"I wanna be the one you think about at night And I wanna be the one that you would put up a fight for"
01:08:19;01:08:23;"You know that I adore That even when you're bored"
01:08:23;01:08:27;"I'd buy you anything and everything I can afford"
01:08:27;01:08:51;"It's time for the Top 5 on iTunes"
01:08:51;01:09:00;"This episode we're doing the Top 5 iTunes songs right now, 2019 versus the Top 5 Billboard hits"
01:09:00;01:09:06;"this week in 1992. Why 1992? Was that the year that Flamin' Hot was introduced to the market?"
01:09:06;01:09:12;"Weirdly I thought that would have been earlier, but I guess Flamin' Hot Cheetos hit the market in 92."
01:09:12;01:09:17;"So we've had 20, uh, 27 years? 27 years of Flamin' Hot. Well I guess that's cool."
01:09:18;01:09:22;"That means that Flamin' Hot the film is gonna be a 90s movie."
01:09:22;01:09:28;"Great. You know, I'm catching up on my touring and plane rides, been checking out more Marvel movies."
01:09:28;01:09:34;"Captain Marvel takes place in the 90s and at first I was kind of into elements of it,"
01:09:34;01:09:39;"but then just like every single, you know, transition, just like blasting some like big 90s"
01:09:39;01:09:44;"songs, like driving down the highway and it got a little bit old. Like STP? Like what kind of stuff?"
01:09:44;01:09:52;"Like rock stuff? Um, yeah, there was definitely some rock stuff. Maybe it was like Sabotage by"
01:09:52;01:09:56;"the Beastie Boys or something. Just like stuff where I was kind of like, yeah, all right, we get it."
01:09:56;01:10:02;"It's the 90s. Anyway, the number five song in 92. I think when we listen to all these 92 songs,"
01:10:02;01:10:07;"we should picture them being in on the soundtrack to the Flamin' Hot movie. So the number five song,"
01:10:07;01:10:11;"classic, Guns N' Roses, November Rain. Wow."
01:10:12;01:10:16;"Like a nine minute ballad in the top five. Hard to picture that now."
01:10:16;01:10:21;"Montanez, get out of my office. There's never going to be Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"There's never going to be Flamin' Hot Cheetos."
01:10:23;01:10:30;"He takes the tray that he made, the famous tray he made at home, like"
01:10:30;01:10:33;"throws it in the garbage. And then who's his wife, Judy? Yeah."
01:10:33;01:10:35;"You got to keep dreaming."
01:10:35;01:10:39;"It's a stupid idea. No, it's not."
01:10:39;01:10:41;"Those Frito-Lay suits are never going to understand it."
01:10:41;01:10:57;"This song is so long. I said get out of my office, Montanez. Why are you still sitting there?"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"Cheetos will never be Flamin' Hot."
01:11:01;01:11:09;"Get going. I'm not leaving this office until you've tried that Cheeto."
01:11:09;01:11:15;"Look me in the eye. Look me in the eye and tell me that is not a step up for our product line."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"for our product line."
01:11:47;01:11:51;"I feel like we've talked about this on the show, but Axl wrote this before"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"Appetite for Destruction."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"Oh, like he's been sitting on this forever?"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"Yeah, there's a demo from like '85"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"that he made it,"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"like a home demo."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Let me check that out."
01:12:03;01:12:05;"And he apparently was pushing to have this song"
01:12:05;01:12:09;"be on Appetite, which would have been a completely different record."
01:12:09;01:12:11;"There's no room for like a true ballad."
01:12:11;01:12:13;"Yeah, like a huge eight minute. That's a real like..."
01:12:13;01:12:15;"Sweet Child of Mine was like the ballad."
01:12:15;01:12:17;"Right."
01:12:17;01:12:19;"Which is not even a ballad."
01:12:19;01:12:21;"This is the 1986 Sound City session."
01:12:21;01:12:23;"Oh wow. 30 seconds longer."
01:12:23;01:12:35;"One of the top YouTube comments."
01:12:35;01:12:39;"I can't believe that humanity can create such masterpiece."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"[Laughter]"
01:12:41;01:12:53;"Played in a much clumsier way."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"I'm going to skip ahead a little."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"Yeah, skip the vocals."
01:12:59;01:13:21;"Sounds tight."
01:13:21;01:13:23;"He rules."
01:13:25;01:13:29;"I've never been like a big Guns N' Roses person."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"Same here."
01:13:31;01:13:33;"I just like kind of missed it."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"Like, of course, I know all the hits."
01:13:35;01:13:37;"But you know, weirdly like..."
01:13:37;01:13:39;"But I know like Ari all loves Guns N' Roses."
01:13:39;01:13:41;"He raps to them a lot."
01:13:41;01:13:43;"And for whatever reason, I didn't know that song Patience."
01:13:43;01:13:45;"And now I feel like I hear it all the time."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"I'm super into that."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"Yeah, Patience rules."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"I mean, this is a really well written song."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"It's weird that..."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"I wish he wrote more beautiful ballads."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Does he get all the way to the outro?"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"The famous outro?"
01:14:03;01:14:09;"So I don't think he had the..."
01:14:09;01:14:11;"That like slash part?"
01:14:11;01:14:13;"Yeah."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"I remember when I was a kid, I knew this song."
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And I don't know why, but..."
01:14:19;01:14:21;"The outro spoke to me so much."
01:14:21;01:14:23;"I was like, ""That part rules."""
01:14:23;01:14:25;"And then I would hear the rest of it."
01:14:25;01:14:27;"And I'd just be like, ""This sucks so bad."""
01:14:27;01:14:29;"Like, get to the slash part."
01:14:31;01:14:41;"This is so fun."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Yeah, I feel like I heard this when I was like nine."
01:14:43;01:14:45;"I was just like..."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"This part gives me chills."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"[Mimics guitar]"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"It's funny, when I was nine, I remember hearing the..."
01:14:53;01:14:55;"Harmonized guitar outro of Hotel California."
01:14:55;01:14:57;"Oh yeah."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"And being like, ""Damn."""
01:14:59;01:15:01;"That gives me chills."
01:15:01;01:15:03;"I mean, that part's amazing."
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Anyway, November Rain, great song."
01:15:05;01:15:07;"The November Rain of 2019."
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Senorita, Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello."
01:15:09;01:15:13;"You know they're a couple?"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"I think I did know that."
01:15:19;01:15:21;"Shawn Mendes is part of a huge Tim Hortons campaign."
01:15:21;01:15:23;"Oh right."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Yeah, we were talking about that on the TC thread."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"How Shawn Mendes did a very kind of earnest commercial for Tim Hortons."
01:15:27;01:15:29;"That reflects on his Canadian heritage."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"And it shows him as a little boy."
01:15:31;01:15:33;"That's kind of like him walking up to buy a donut at Tim Hortons."
01:15:33;01:15:35;"They're like, ""Hey Shawn!"""
01:15:35;01:15:37;"And he's like a little boy throwing up some change on the thing."
01:15:37;01:15:39;"It's like a real feel good thing."
01:15:39;01:15:41;"And Shawn Mendes is like, ""Hey Shawn!"""
01:15:41;01:15:43;"And he's like a little boy throwing up some change on the thing."
01:15:43;01:15:45;"And it's like a real feel good thing."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"And Shawn Mendes, who came through the Vampire Weekend Webster Hall show,"
01:15:49;01:15:51;"I mean, RL chopped it up with him."
01:15:51;01:15:53;"Super nice guy."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"Super cool."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"And he's just like,"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"You know, kind of what you'd expect from a Canadian pop star."
01:15:59;01:16:01;"Talented, cool, humble."
01:16:03;01:16:05;"Perfect guy for a Tim Hortons campaign."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"The thing that I was reflecting on was like,"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"How you just can't picture Justin Bieber having a Tim Hortons campaign."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"So just picturing like,"
01:16:15;01:16:17;"I was thinking more about that."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"I'm not trying to pit them against each other,"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"but why does Shawn Mendes feel so much more Canadian than Bieber?"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"Did Bieber renounce his Canadian vibe?"
01:16:27;01:16:29;"Weigh in on this Seinfeld, you're the resident Canadian."
01:16:31;01:16:33;"Oh wow, okay."
01:16:33;01:16:35;"So Bieber fully embraced the American lifestyle, right?"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"He was co-opted by Usher."
01:16:39;01:16:41;"Didn't he record his first album at Atlanta?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"Yeah, I believe so."
01:16:43;01:16:45;"Doesn't he live in like, Calabasas or something?"
01:16:45;01:16:47;"And then he was like, driving around with his Maserati and p***ing in buckets."
01:16:49;01:16:51;"I'm not saying that's synonymous with American culture,"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"but I'm saying he-"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"You don't p*** in buckets up there in Canada."
01:16:55;01:16:57;"You never do."
01:16:57;01:16:59;"It's been a while."
01:16:59;01:17:01;"But yeah, so I mean I just feel like,"
01:17:01;01:17:03;"Shawn Mendes has just been a gentler,"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"more wholesome presence."
01:17:07;01:17:09;"He never really had that,"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"those wildfires, those wilderness,"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"what are those, salad days?"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"Is that what you said? No."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"Salad days are good."
01:17:17;01:17:19;"You know what I'm saying though."
01:17:19;01:17:21;"You didn't sow his wild oats."
01:17:21;01:17:23;"There you go."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"Maybe this is the beginning of the wild oats being sowed."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"Like maybe he'll break up with Camila and p*** in a bucket."
01:17:27;01:17:29;"Renounce Tim Hortons."
01:17:29;01:17:31;"Right?"
01:17:31;01:17:33;"But it's funny because when I was talking about how like,"
01:17:33;01:17:35;"you can't picture Justin Bieber just like,"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"humbly sipping on like a hot Tim Hortons."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"We found a picture of him just like wearing some like,"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"f***ing like ragged ass street wear,"
01:17:41;01:17:43;"like crazy outfit,"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"holding like a giant Starbucks."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"And you're like, yeah that's Bieber."
01:17:47;01:17:49;"It's like a giant Starbucks iced coffee."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"And Shawn Mendes is a little more like,"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"oh you know man,"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"I just like to get a nice hot coffee from Tim Hortons."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Yeah, like stop by Timmy's,"
01:17:59;01:18:01;"get a nice hot coffee."
01:18:01;01:18:03;"It's real cold outside."
01:18:03;01:18:05;"Like Justin Bieber,"
01:18:05;01:18:07;"I was picturing Justin Bieber like,"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"back on Ontario in like,"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"October, and it's like 50 degrees."
01:18:11;01:18:13;"And he's just like,"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"what the f***?"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"F*** this s***."
01:18:17;01:18:19;"Why is it so f***ing cold?"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"And like,"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"everybody's like, oh Justin remember,"
01:18:23;01:18:25;"you know when you were a little boy,"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"when it was really cold in the winter,"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"it was going down to -5 degrees."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"And he's like, no honestly f*** this s***."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"I want an ice, it's too cold to have a f***ing iced coffee."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"Can the plane leave?"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"F***ing sick of this s***."
01:18:37;01:18:39;"Just breaking all the rules of being a good Canadian."
01:18:39;01:18:41;"Wearing a Gucci bucket hat."
01:18:41;01:18:43;"Is it lame as a Canadian to"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"complain about the cold?"
01:18:45;01:18:47;"We complain about the cold."
01:18:47;01:18:49;"It's kind of part of the lifestyle."
01:18:49;01:18:51;"Is it lame?"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"No, I think it's par for the course."
01:18:53;01:18:55;"But do you have to have like a smile about it?"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"Like, do you have to be a little bit like,"
01:18:57;01:18:59;"oh it's so cold, wow."
01:18:59;01:19:01;"Do we have a smile about it?"
01:19:01;01:19:03;"No, I mean it's pretty miserable."
01:19:03;01:19:05;"Like, we're not exempt from the human conditions."
01:19:05;01:19:07;"You're allowed to walk into -"
01:19:07;01:19:09;"and I mean I'm talking about"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"like the real Canada."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"I'm not talking about, you know -"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"What's the real Canada?"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"I'm not talking about a downtown penthouse in Toronto."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"I'm talking about real Canadians."
01:19:19;01:19:21;"What, like the Yukon?"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"I'm not talking about -"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"The Northwest Territories?"
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Newfoundland?"
01:19:27;01:19:29;"I'm talking about Calgary."
01:19:29;01:19:31;"I'm talking about like -"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"Toronto gets pretty cold."
01:19:33;01:19:35;"Medicine hat."
01:19:35;01:19:37;"At a certain point -"
01:19:37;01:19:39;"I know Toronto gets cold,"
01:19:39;01:19:41;"but also Toronto's gotten very full of money"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"and built up lately."
01:19:43;01:19:45;"Yeah, tell me more."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"I just heard that because like -"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"I was just talking to a promoter in Toronto"
01:19:49;01:19:51;"and they were just like -"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"the tickets for our Toronto show went very quickly"
01:19:53;01:19:55;"and they were like, oh Toronto's a very hot market lately."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"And I was like, oh yeah, well Toronto's a great city."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"That doesn't surprise me."
01:19:59;01:20:01;"Why is it hotter now?"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"And they're just like, oh you know,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"they built up downtown so many new -"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"so many kind of like yuppies moving in -"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"This accent."
01:20:09;01:20:11;"It's subtle."
01:20:11;01:20:13;"He's doing good work."
01:20:13;01:20:15;"I'm doing real subtle."
01:20:15;01:20:17;"All these yuppies moving in in Toronto."
01:20:17;01:20:19;"Not for Vampire Weekend in general,"
01:20:19;01:20:21;"even though I'll admit we have some yuppie fans,"
01:20:21;01:20:23;"but they're just saying, just generally speaking,"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"a lot more young people with money"
01:20:25;01:20:27;"are coming to Toronto so that there's more"
01:20:27;01:20:29;"concert tickets sell and I'm sure there's"
01:20:29;01:20:31;"way more restaurants and coffee shops and bars"
01:20:31;01:20:35;"to serve a kind of international elite."
01:20:35;01:20:37;"So Toronto's - over the past decade,"
01:20:37;01:20:41;"Toronto's waterfront got developed quite a bit"
01:20:41;01:20:43;"and filled with these condos that have sprung up"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"overnight essentially."
01:20:45;01:20:47;"So it's just like this wall to wall."
01:20:47;01:20:49;"The skyline is just - around where the CN Tower is,"
01:20:49;01:20:51;"it's just wall to wall condos."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"So it's like with any city."
01:20:53;01:20:55;"It's like Austin, Texas, and obviously New York."
01:20:55;01:20:57;"It's always a part of the New York story"
01:20:57;01:20:59;"is that the people who were there before"
01:20:59;01:21:01;"all the condos went up being a little bit like,"
01:21:01;01:21:03;"""Oh, look at you guys."""
01:21:03;01:21:05;"Because usually the crowd that comes in with the condos"
01:21:05;01:21:07;"is not locals."
01:21:07;01:21:09;"So there's maybe a feeling of like,"
01:21:09;01:21:11;"""Are you really down with what it means to love this place"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"or you just want a kind of anonymous,"
01:21:13;01:21:15;"wealthy aesthetic?"""
01:21:15;01:21:17;"True, yeah."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Downtown Los Angeles, you're seeing it happen."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"Of course, you're seeing it in every city."
01:21:21;01:21:23;"But I'm saying in Canada,"
01:21:23;01:21:25;"which is a specific, very proud place,"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"I just wonder if"
01:21:27;01:21:29;"your attitude towards the cold"
01:21:29;01:21:31;"maybe separates"
01:21:31;01:21:33;"the new condo people"
01:21:33;01:21:35;"from the old school."
01:21:35;01:21:37;"So you walk into your office in downtown Toronto"
01:21:37;01:21:39;"and one person walks in and is like,"
01:21:39;01:21:41;"""Oh, man."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"It was so cold out there."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"I thought my damn eyeballs were about to"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"freeze and fall out and shatter on the ground."""
01:21:47;01:21:49;"And everybody's like, ""Oh, yeah, it was cold."""
01:21:49;01:21:51;"Then somebody else comes in and is like,"
01:21:51;01:21:53;"""Fuck, it was fucking cold. Fuck this winter."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"Jesus fucking Christ, I hate it."""
01:21:55;01:21:57;"And then that person is like,"
01:21:57;01:21:59;"""Oh, yeah."""
01:21:59;01:22:01;"One person's more like the Shawn Mendes"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"and one person's the Justin Bieber."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"You know what I mean?"
01:22:05;01:22:07;"Yeah, I think you'd find that about maybe people who"
01:22:07;01:22:09;"have come from, I don't know,"
01:22:09;01:22:11;"if somebody moved there from California or something,"
01:22:11;01:22:13;"you might..."
01:22:13;01:22:15;"Hey, gang, Corporate wants to shake things up a bit."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"So we're bringing in a new manager."

01:24:29;01:24:31;"Sean's cold. Sean's very cold."
01:24:31;01:24:33;"But he's not talking the way you're talking."
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Do you think you're any colder than Sean, Justin?"
01:24:37;01:24:39;"Sean might even be colder than you, Justin."
01:24:39;01:24:41;"What?"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Oh my god."
