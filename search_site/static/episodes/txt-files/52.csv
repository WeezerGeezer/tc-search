00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back in effect."
00:03;00:07;"I'm joined by Jake, a man who's about to get married."
00:07;00:11;"Slash got married. Depends how you look at it."
00:11;00:17;"We'll be talking about Time Crisis topics, like John Mayer, The Grateful Dead."
00:17;00:20;"Maybe even Boz Skax."
00:20;00:22;"Lot of guitarists."
00:22;00:23;"This is..."
00:23;00:27;"Time Crisis, with Eds Runkainen."
00:27;00:30;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:30;00:31;"One."
00:31;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:37;00:44;"They were a pal to a manly, all my rightful chances"
00:44;00:51;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:51;00:58;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
00:58;01:03;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:03;01:09;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:09;01:14;"He's the lonely man"
01:14;01:17;"Time Crisis, September 24th, 2017."
01:17;01:21;"Jake and I are not actually recording on September 24th."
01:21;01:23;"We're doing a real early one right now."
01:23;01:26;"The reason being, there's a lot of reasons why we're recording early."
01:26;01:30;"The most important is that Jake's about to get married."
01:30;01:34;"He will have gotten married by the time you're hearing this."
01:34;01:36;"So congratulations, Jake."
01:36;01:37;"Thank you."
01:37;01:42;"I feel like we haven't really talked much about your engagement/marriage on the show."
01:42;01:45;"Well, I'm a private person."
01:45;01:47;"Jake really values his privacy."
01:47;01:53;"I mean, we don't have to get into specific details, but just on a basic level..."
01:53;01:56;"The wedding went well, went great."
01:56;01:57;"You think the wedding went well?"
01:57;01:58;"It was everything I could have dreamed of."
01:58;02:00;"Maybe just on some basic questions."
02:00;02:02;"First marriage?"
02:02;02:04;"Yeah."
02:04;02:07;"I was asked that recently. Who asked me that?"
02:07;02:09;"Oh, oh, okay."
02:09;02:11;"So this is kind of funny, actually."
02:11;02:13;"Our wedding announcement is going to be in the New York Times."
02:13;02:18;"Because Hannah's mom, Linda Greenhouse, used to work for the Times."
02:18;02:21;"And so she was like, ""Hannah, you should really try to get your wedding announcement in the Times."""
02:21;02:23;"It's like something that..."
02:23;02:24;"Oh, yeah, I love that."
02:24;02:29;"So it's like some New York real estate guy marrying someone that went to Vassar or something."
02:29;02:32;"Yeah, it's always like Ivy League doctors and lawyers."
02:32;02:35;"Wait, so is it going to be Jake Longstreth, son of..."
02:35;02:36;"Yeah."
02:36;02:37;"From Connecticut."
02:37;02:38;"Yeah."
02:38;02:39;"What's your town again in Connecticut?"
02:39;02:40;"Southbury."
02:40;02:42;"Jake Longstreth of Southbury, Connecticut."
02:42;02:47;"Yeah, and I went into very elaborate detail with this person from the Times about..."
02:47;02:48;"Because they were interviewing you."
02:48;02:49;"About my parents' careers."
02:49;02:50;"Right."
02:50;02:51;"What did they want?"
02:51;02:52;"They wanted all of the..."
02:52;02:54;"I couldn't believe the level of detail they wanted."
02:54;02:58;"They were like, ""Well, when your mom worked for the state of Connecticut in the chief state's attorney's office,"
02:58;03:00;"was that in Rocky Hill or Wallingford?"""
03:00;03:02;"And I'm like, ""I don't know."""
03:02;03:04;"Like they moved offices at some point in the '90s."
03:04;03:05;"That's sick."
03:05;03:10;"Do you think they'll mention brother Dave Longstreth of Indie Rock Band Dirty Projectors?"
03:10;03:11;"Well, I think so."
03:11;03:13;"And actually, you know what's funny, man?"
03:13;03:14;"Time Crisis..."
03:14;03:15;"Might get a mention?"
03:15;03:17;"Well, I was debating whether to mention it."
03:17;03:18;"Yeah."
03:18;03:20;"I actually leaned against mentioning it."
03:20;03:21;"Fair enough."
03:21;03:22;"I don't know why, though."
03:22;03:23;"I was sort of like, ""That seems like..."
03:23;03:24;"I mean, it's a fun show."
03:24;03:25;"I love the show."""
03:25;03:28;"No, but first and foremost, you're a painter."
03:28;03:29;"Right, I'm an art..."
03:29;03:30;"Yeah."
03:30;03:31;"No offense taken."
03:31;03:34;"You certainly don't want to be known as a Time Crisis host."
03:34;03:39;"Even though my Wikipedia page says artist/radio personality."
03:39;03:43;"Wait, isn't it American painter/radio personality?"
03:43;03:45;"Well, as long as the painter's first."
03:45;03:46;"Yeah, yeah."
03:46;03:47;"I know, but I can understand."
03:47;03:48;"New York Times is kind of high stakes."
03:48;03:50;"You don't want it to say like..."
03:50;03:55;"Noted Beats 1 radio host Jake Longstreth recently tied the knot."
03:55;03:57;"No, it's probably more formal language than that."
03:57;04:00;"So they asked me, they were like, ""Is this your first marriage?"""
04:00;04:01;"Yeah."
04:01;04:02;"And I was like, ""Yep."""
04:02;04:03;"I thought it was like a funny question."
04:03;04:06;"Like, if it was my second marriage, would it say that?"
04:06;04:09;"Would it say, ""Mr. Longstreth, previously married."""
04:09;04:10;"Yeah, that'd be crazy."
04:10;04:15;"It's like, if somebody really wanted their wedding announcement to be in the New York Times,"
04:15;04:18;"probably the last thing you would want is to be like,"
04:18;04:25;"previously married to this person who probably is not psyched about being mentioned."
04:25;04:26;"Well, that's tight."
04:26;04:28;"So that might be out today."
04:28;04:29;"Yeah, Sunday the 24th."
04:29;04:30;"The day of the airing."
04:30;04:33;"Everyone go pick up a Sunday Times."
04:33;04:34;"I love that."
04:34;04:38;"Flip to the wedding or vow section."
04:38;04:39;"That's incredible."
04:39;04:41;"We did a stressful headshot."
04:41;04:42;"Yeah, headshot."
04:42;04:43;"We just did it this morning."
04:43;04:44;"We forgot to get it to them."
04:44;04:45;"iPhone?"
04:45;04:46;"Just selfie?"
04:46;04:47;"Yep, iPhone selfie."
04:47;04:50;"And we also tried on Hannah's laptop."
04:50;04:51;"Yeah."
04:51;04:53;"To like try to do that, but like it's too low res."
04:53;04:54;"What were you wearing in the picture?"
04:54;04:55;"T-shirt."
04:55;04:56;"What T-shirt?"
04:56;04:58;"A Sweet Martha's cookie jar?"
04:58;05:00;"No, just a gray T-shirt that says, ""Chill out."""
05:00;05:01;"I was wondering, okay."
05:01;05:03;"But you can't see the chill out."
05:03;05:06;"I want to point out, it's also an ash gray T-shirt."
05:06;05:07;"Yeah."
05:07;05:08;"Kind of like a gym T-shirt."
05:08;05:11;"I think it's a black and white photo though, but maybe I'm wrong."
05:11;05:13;"Wait, why does the T-shirt say, ""Chill out?"""
05:13;05:14;"What is that?"
05:14;05:15;"I don't know."
05:15;05:16;"Hannah got this from me."
05:16;05:18;"At like a truck stop?"
05:18;05:19;"Yeah."
05:19;05:22;"It's like a funny, dumb T-shirt."
05:22;05:23;"It just says, ""Chill out."""
05:23;05:25;"[laughs]"
05:25;05:26;"It's not the worst advice."
05:26;05:30;"Mr. Longstreth, pictured above in an ash gray, ""Chill out"" T-shirt."
05:30;05:32;"Hopefully the photo is acceptable."
05:32;05:37;"They were very intense and specific about the specs in the photo."
05:37;05:38;"Well, think about it."
05:38;05:42;"Most people who are probably sending in their photo are probably having like a big, fancy wedding."
05:42;05:43;"Yeah."
05:43;05:47;"They get a professional photographer, and they probably do their makeup and stuff."
05:47;05:50;"You guys are just sending in a laptop picture."
05:50;05:57;"We actually went to the Huntington Gardens a month ago and had our friend, who has a nice SLR,"
05:57;06:00;"shoot photos of us, and we were wearing nice clothes."
06:00;06:01;"Yeah."
06:01;06:05;"I'm a solid seven inches taller than Hannah."
06:05;06:06;"Right."
06:06;06:08;"Our heads are at different levels."
06:08;06:09;"Right."
06:09;06:14;"I talked to the Times person last week, and they were like, ""We need to have your heads at the same level."""
06:14;06:15;"We can't have--"
06:15;06:16;"Right."
06:16;06:17;"It's just like a tight, cropped headshot."
06:17;06:18;"Yeah."
06:18;06:21;"Then we were like, ""Oh, okay,"" and then we forgot about it."
06:21;06:24;"Then this morning, Hannah was like, ""Oh, my God."
06:24;06:26;"We have to send in the headshots."""
06:26;06:28;"Then I'm like crouching."
06:28;06:29;"Right."
06:29;06:30;"I'm doing like a squat."
06:30;06:33;"Speaking of that, I went to the Emmys, but one thing I noticed is that--"
06:33;06:36;"Okay, so you know when somebody wins an Emmy, and there's a whole crew of people on stage?"
06:36;06:39;"Like when Saturday Night Live wins, and they have 15 people on stage?"
06:39;06:46;"You have the person up front speaking, and then you notice that certain people who'd been around the block would squat a little bit"
06:46;06:50;"because when the camera's focused on the award winner, and you have a whole phalanx of people in the back,"
06:50;06:52;"almost all their heads are getting cut off."
06:52;06:55;"I kept noticing there would be some people--"
06:55;06:57;"Maybe they could kind of see the monitor or something."
06:57;07:02;"There would be some people standing in the back who'd take themselves down like a solid six inches."
07:02;07:05;"In person, you're looking at somebody just squatting on stage."
07:05;07:06;"You're just like, ""What are you doing?"""
07:06;07:09;"Then you look at the live feed, and you're kind of like, ""Oh, all right."""
07:09;07:11;"I guess you want to get your whole face in there."
07:11;07:13;"That's this funny thing that happens at awards shows."
07:13;07:14;"People are just like--"
07:14;07:18;"Just like, ""Hold that. Hold that ab. Tighten the stomach up."""
07:18;07:22;"Yeah, straight up, they're doing squats so that their face can be on TV."
07:22;07:24;"Got to have your face on TV."
09:46;09:48;"Did you see Spicer?"
09:48;09:49;"Oh, yeah."
09:49;09:50;"Did you chill with him?"
09:50;09:53;"No, we did not chill with him, but we went to an after party."
09:53;09:56;"Don't tell me-- No, my-- Are you serious?"
09:56;09:57;"He was there."
09:57;10:00;"I mean, were people already aware of the backlash?"
10:00;10:03;"I was in punching distance of Spicer."
10:03;10:04;"Spitting distance?"
10:04;10:07;"He was up in the mix. It was weird."
10:07;10:10;"You know, like, when you're actually sitting in the audience at these award shows,"
10:10;10:13;"it's actually so stupid. It's so much better to watch on TV,"
10:13;10:15;"'cause it's like you're in a big, boomy arena."
10:15;10:17;"You can barely hear what's going on, so you don't really have a--"
10:17;10:19;"So we kind of saw Sean Spicer and were like, ""What?"""
10:19;10:20;"That was really--"
10:20;10:24;"And then, at this party, he was there, and--"
10:24;10:25;"Where was the party?"
10:25;10:29;"It was at a kind of fancy club in Hollywood."
10:29;10:30;"Uh-huh."
10:30;10:31;"A chic little club."
10:31;10:34;"So it's fun. I'm looking around, and you see, like,"
10:34;10:37;"who-- You know, all these big celebrities, Colbert and all these people"
10:37;10:40;"and all the cast of Modern Family and stuff,"
10:40;10:42;"and you just see Sean Spicer."
10:42;10:44;"He-- Was he rolling with a crew?"
10:44;10:47;"Well, this is kind of on our way out."
10:47;10:50;"Actually, we were standing with somebody who kind of saw him,"
10:50;10:51;"and they were like, ""All right."""
10:51;10:53;"'Cause we were already-- They were tired,"
10:53;10:55;"and we were already talking to some people who were like, ""Should we leave?"""
10:55;10:58;"And then we saw him, and everybody was like, ""Yeah, let's bounce."""
10:58;11:04;"But on our way out, he was laughing, yucking it up, having the time of his life."
11:04;11:06;"He was surrounded by a group of people."
11:06;11:09;"None of the, like, kind of famous celebrities we're talking to,"
11:09;11:12;"but he was surrounded by this group of kind of younger people"
11:12;11:14;"that he was, like, cracking jokes with them and stuff,"
11:14;11:16;"and I was like, ""What are they talking about?"
11:16;11:18;"This is so weird."""
11:18;11:19;"Wow."
11:19;11:21;"Not feeling this, and then bounced."
11:21;11:25;"Had you looked at Twitter yet and seen that Twitter was exploding?"
11:25;11:26;"I hadn't."
11:26;11:28;"This is completely inappropriate and insane."
11:28;11:30;"No, that was also funny to be in this bizarre situation,"
11:30;11:32;"just kind of watching it live."
11:32;11:37;"So we were kind of, like, in the ride from the theater to the after party,"
11:37;11:40;"and we hadn't looked at Twitter yet, so we were just like--"
11:40;11:43;"It's also funny 'cause, like, Twitter amplifies stuff in such an extreme way."
11:43;11:45;"So we were just kind of like-- They were like,"
11:45;11:47;"""That was weird that they got Sean Spicer."
11:47;11:49;"Yeah, that didn't seem necessary."""
11:49;11:52;"And we were kind of like, ""Well, I guess it's just for, like, the laughs."""
11:52;11:54;"Probably the audience loved it at home."
11:54;11:57;"I mean, it's still kind of weird to see Twitter that's just like,"
11:57;11:59;"""It's disgusting that these Hollywood fascists"
11:59;12:03;"would even just consider to bring this dude out."""
12:03;12:04;"It's strange."
12:04;12:05;"That's interesting to hear."
12:05;12:08;"I mean, if you were there, you're saying, you know,"
12:08;12:10;"it was just kind of another gag."
12:10;12:13;"'Cause I saw it on Twitter, and I was like, ""Yeah, that is insane."""
12:13;12:15;"Like, it seemed to me like--"
12:15;12:21;"Because I received that news secondhand through this insanely opinionated"
12:21;12:24;"aggregate of people's opinions,"
12:24;12:26;"then it sort of is like, ""Yeah, that is crazy."
12:26;12:28;"That is crazy tone deaf."""
12:28;12:33;"Also, like, Colbert seems so smart and cynical in the best way."
12:33;12:36;"I mean, I guess he kind of roasted him,"
12:36;12:39;"but obviously that's not going to be enough"
12:39;12:43;"when you're talking about, like, you know, real-life politics."
12:43;12:46;"I guess also sitting in the theater, we kind of looked around,"
12:46;12:49;"and so many people had this weird look on their face"
12:49;12:53;"that the atmosphere in the theater was already kind of, like, harsh,"
12:53;12:56;"that people were like, ""Whoa, [bleep] this dude."""
12:56;13:00;"So in a weird way, it almost seemed like the appropriate response--"
13:00;13:02;"Yeah, you know, I guess that's the thing."
13:02;13:04;"Being there and seeing people already be kind of harshed out,"
13:04;13:06;"I was like, ""All right, yeah. People don't like this guy."
13:06;13:10;"They know that he's a--you know, he worked for a really bad person"
13:10;13:12;"spreading lies."""
13:12;13:15;"So that secondary idea of, like, but should he have been there in the first place,"
13:15;13:18;"that only dawned on us later as we were kind of, like, rolling out and being like--"
13:18;13:21;"'cause we actually started to talk about the--you're just there,"
13:21;13:23;"so this guy comes on stage and he leaves,"
13:23;13:25;"and then we're talking about the logistics of it, and we're like,"
13:25;13:27;"""Whoa,"" so they had to reach out to him, be like,"
13:27;13:29;"""You know, can we arrange Mr. Spicer's travel?"
13:29;13:31;"First class, of course. What hotel does he want?"""
13:31;13:33;"And then you start thinking about that stuff, and you're like--"
13:33;13:35;"to put him on TV in front of millions of people,"
13:35;13:37;"and then you're like, ""Oh, yeah, that's insane."""
13:37;13:41;"♪ They're gonna put me in the movies ♪"
13:41;13:46;"♪ They're gonna make a big star out of me ♪"
13:46;13:51;"♪ We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely ♪"

14:38;14:41;"You know what it is? It's become so fashionable now,"
14:41;14:45;"the past 10, 15 years, that everybody has to poke fun at themselves."
14:45;14:47;"It used to be this really--"
14:47;14:50;"Remember, it started maybe in the late '90s"
14:50;14:52;"when some played-out old celebrity would come out"
14:52;14:54;"and have a joke about themselves and be like,"
14:54;14:57;"""Yeah, it's me, the guy from that '70s TV show."""
14:57;14:59;"Or just be like, ""Yeah."""
14:59;15:02;"Or Bob Saget, he was a pioneer of that,"
15:02;15:05;"being like, ""Hey, you probably know me as the dad from Full House."
15:05;15:07;"- Well, guess what?"" - ""I got a filthy mouth."""
15:07;15:12;"""I got a filthy mouth, so suck my d--k, you f--king piece of s--t."""
15:12;15:14;"And it was like, ""Aah!"""
15:14;15:16;"That was really novel at the time to be like,"
15:16;15:18;"""So, p--t, my p--t!"""
15:18;15:20;"And it was like, ""Oh, my God!"""
15:20;15:23;"And then it was also really novel for people to come out and be like,"
15:23;15:26;"""Yeah, you know, I know you hate me."
15:26;15:29;"Well, guess what? I can laugh about it."""
15:29;15:31;"Actually, this year, with Trump in the White House,"
15:31;15:34;"it really felt like that kind of self-referential celebrity stuff"
15:34;15:36;"was coming to an end."
15:36;15:38;"And I think one of the smarter things that I saw pointed out"
15:38;15:40;"about the Sean Spicer thing was they were like,"
15:40;15:43;"""Okay, this is Sean Spicer. This is so soon."
15:43;15:45;"This is how it's going to go down for all these guys."
15:45;15:47;"This is how it's going to go down for Trump."""
15:47;15:49;"I mean, even look at the way, like, Bush can, like,"
15:49;15:52;"have a picture of Michelle Obama giving him a hug and goes viral."
15:52;15:54;"Or like Bush is doing his weird paintings."
15:54;15:56;"Yeah, friendship goals, painting goals."
15:56;15:58;"And it's like, you can totally picture"
15:58;16:03;"in the Comedy Central roast of Donald Trump 2025,"
16:03;16:07;"and he gets up and is like, ""I know I did a few crazy things."
16:07;16:09;"Let's just say I was hanging out with Steve Bannon a little too much."""
16:09;16:11;"Like, everybody's like dying."
16:11;16:15;"I remember we had a joke on this show about Trump doing advertising"
16:15;16:17;"for, like, Rockstar Energy Drink and being like,"
16:17;16:19;"""That was a crazy 18 months."
16:19;16:22;"Not as crazy as the amount of caffeine in the new Rockstar Energy Drink."""
16:22;16:24;"That was a crazy eight years."
16:24;16:25;"Oh, God."
16:25;16:27;"It's so crazy."
16:27;16:31;"You know Trump will go back to, like, bad TV and, like,"
16:31;16:34;"celebrity culture as soon as he's out of office,"
16:34;16:37;"whether he resigns or serves eight years."
16:37;16:38;"He'll find his way in."
16:38;16:39;"He'll just find it."
16:39;16:41;"Although, look, there's going to be opposition to it, which is good."
16:41;16:43;"But you know what also is interesting?"
16:43;16:47;"Remember in the O.J. documentary series, O.J. Made in America?"
16:47;16:48;"Yeah."
16:48;16:52;"Now, in the mid-'90s, most people believed that he did, in fact,"
16:52;16:53;"murder two people."
16:53;16:54;"Yeah."
16:54;16:57;"His wife was an abusive spouse to his ex-wife."
16:57;17:02;"So when he got free, they talk about how he wasn't welcomed back into polite society."
17:02;17:05;"He tried to go to the same Brentwood, Beverly Hills restaurants."
17:05;17:06;"It didn't work."
17:06;17:07;"He had to, like, move to Florida."
17:07;17:09;"His career was kind of messed up."
17:09;17:11;"I don't know what he expected, but clearly people iced him out."
17:11;17:15;"And there's some part of me that feels like on one level in 2017 people are more"
17:15;17:18;"sensitive than ever, call out everything."
17:18;17:22;"And then there's this equally strong oppositional force that's just as extreme,"
17:22;17:26;"if not more extreme, that's kind of like you can laugh about everything."
17:26;17:30;"So weirdly, I almost feel like if the O.J. thing had happened in 2017,"
17:30;17:34;"he also because of social media, even if they didn't let him into his Brentwood"
17:34;17:37;"restaurant, he could just be like, ""All right, let me throw an Instagram Live."
17:37;17:39;"What's up, O.J. family? I'm here."
17:39;17:41;"These jackasses won't let me in."""
17:41;17:44;"He could become like in the same way Alex Jones can talk directly to his fan base."
17:44;17:45;"Right."
17:45;17:48;"If you're O.J. or something, ""Okay, these snooty people don't want to let me"
17:48;17:51;"in the restaurant anymore,"" he'd weirdly have more of a career now."
17:51;17:52;"Yeah."
17:52;17:56;"There probably were a bunch of people after O.J. who would have supported him,"
17:56;18:01;"but the mainstream media wouldn't help him, so he had to do weird straight-to-video"
18:01;18:04;"prank shows and stuff, club appearances."
18:04;18:09;"But even the people that aren't fans, as clearly is the case with Spicer,"
18:09;18:13;"are on board with immediately making it a joke again."
18:13;18:15;"That's interesting. Yeah, 2017."
18:15;18:17;"I mean, it's like all--"
18:17;18:23;"One month after the acquittal, O.J. on Colbert Tonight."
18:23;18:24;"Now--"
18:24;18:27;"I bet Stern would have him on."
18:27;18:28;"Jesus."
18:28;18:30;"That will happen, don't you think?"
18:30;18:31;"Okay, so let me get this straight."
18:31;18:33;"Did you kill your wife?"
18:33;18:35;"Come on. Just tell us."
18:35;18:37;"Imagine if he just admits it on Stern."
18:37;18:39;"Howard, you get people to say the crazy--"
18:39;18:41;"Yeah, I did it."
18:41;18:42;"Come on."
18:42;18:44;"Howard, you're the master."
18:44;18:47;"Howard, you are-- Okay."
18:47;18:48;"Come on."
18:48;18:51;"Okay, even if Howard Stern wouldn't have him on, even if Colbert wouldn't have him on,"
18:51;18:53;"I'm picturing the 2017."
18:53;18:57;"O.J. acquittal immediately comes out of prison."
18:57;18:58;"Ten million Twitter followers."
18:58;18:59;"Oh, yeah."
18:59;19:01;"The Instagram is popping."
19:01;19:02;"I mean, think about that."
19:02;19:05;"Trump, Trump's going to have millions of--"
19:05;19:06;"Ugh."

22:15;22:17;"from today and 1976"
22:17;22:21;"we're gonna be talking about Boz Skaggs, John Mayer, The Grateful Dead"

22:23;22:25;"there's so much to go deep on, man"
22:25;22:27;"just all the best music"

22:30;22:32;"Time Crisis"
22:32;22:34;"on Beat 1"
22:34;22:37;"they see each other for the first time as kids in school"

22:40;22:43;"my heart races, I'm correlating"
22:43;22:46;"the fact it only seems to make 'em"
22:46;22:49;"the lost souls"
22:49;22:52;"the lost girls"
22:52;22:55;"where are all my lost souls?"
22:55;23:01;"always be yourself and never give 'em a shame"
23:01;23:04;"see, the only real change is realising the same"
23:04;23:06;"I've been chopping off, rubber-cropping off"
23:06;23:07;"everybody used to say I'm strange"
23:07;23:09;"now I'm opening their minds"

23:10;23:13;"serenade pieces that are broken"
23:13;23:13;"turn to pearl"
23:13;23:15;"once you let the picture flip"

23:23;23:26;"yo, keep doing what you do"
23:26;23:29;"just 'cause they say their love don't look like you"
23:30;23:32;"I know I'm bound to"
23:32;23:35;"'cause you and me, we're lost, boom"
23:35;23:38;"so don't let the witch come through"
23:38;23:41;"because they say their love don't look like you"
23:41;23:44;"oh, if they only knew"
23:44;23:47;"that me and you were lost, boom"
23:47;23:49;"yo, save the judge"
23:49;23:51;"man said again, said he's changing us"
23:51;23:52;"all I wanna do is just salvage us"
23:52;23:53;"and everybody looking at me like I'm an angel"
23:53;23:55;"though it's as if it took some time to be brave enough"
23:55;23:57;"life being this out, it's just dangerous"
23:57;23:59;"hold up, giving up the aim enough to keep us down"
23:59;24:00;"hook on all of us, though"
24:00;24:03;"whoever that living in any hemisphere"
24:03;24:06;"never fear being considered weird or irregular"
24:06;24:09;"learn all of yourself to be void of the shelf"
24:09;24:11;"'cause when they said actions speak louder"
24:11;24:13;"it was word of mouth"
24:13;24:15;"keep doing what you do"
24:15;24:18;"just 'cause they say their love don't look like you"
24:18;24:21;"I know I'm bound to"
24:21;24:24;"'cause you and me, we're lost, boom"
24:24;24:27;"so don't let the witch come through"
24:27;24:30;"because they say their love don't look like you"
24:30;24:34;"oh, if they only knew"
24:34;24:37;"that me and you were lost, boom"
24:37;24:52;"please don't say so"
24:52;24:55;"much as I'm breaking for you"
24:56;25:01;"I never knew how everybody is a bummer"
25:01;25:04;"keep doing what you do"
25:04;25:07;"just 'cause they say their love don't look like you"
25:07;25:11;"I know I'm bound to"
25:11;25:14;"'cause you and me, we're lost, boom"
25:14;25:17;"so don't let the witch come through"

25:19;25:23;"oh, if they only knew"
25:23;25:26;"that me and you were lost, boom"
25:49;25:53;"So, Jake, we were talking last weekend"
25:53;25:56;"the time that you went to go see the dead and co"
25:56;25:59;"to me is just the time crisis gift that keeps on giving"
25:59;26:01;"and I just want to explain to everybody again"
26:01;26:05;"because at this point if you're a regular time crisis listener"
26:05;26:08;"you have to have some cursory familiarity with the Grateful Dead"
26:08;26:10;"but just so everybody understands"
26:10;26:14;"Grateful Dead was a band for almost 30 years"
26:14;26:18;"the leader, kind of main singer"
26:18;26:20;"guitar god Jerry Garcia died in '95"
26:20;26:23;"then you had all the other guys kind of doing this and that"
26:23;26:27;"and then the Grateful Dead the past year"
26:27;26:30;"has been touring as Dead & Company"
26:30;26:31;"and doing a fairly big tour"
26:31;26:35;"where it's a few of the original members"
26:35;26:38;"plus John Mayer kind of filling in for Jerry Garcia"
26:38;26:39;"right"
26:39;26:41;"I feel like for some reason this tour"
26:41;26:43;"people are talking about it as if it's like"
26:43;26:46;"it's almost like going to see the Grateful Dead or something"
26:46;26:47;"are they?"
26:47;26:48;"maybe it's just because of John Mayer"
26:48;26:49;"it's like higher profile than like"
26:49;26:52;"in early 2000s Phil Lesh and Friends"
26:52;26:54;"right I mean yeah I mean since"
26:54;26:55;"because they're doing all Grateful Dead songs"
26:55;26:57;"I mean there's been 20 plus years of like"
26:57;27:01;"they're surviving members with like a rotating cast of other players"
27:01;27:05;"doing different versions of dead spinoff bands"
27:05;27:07;"it just seems like this is being billed as like more official"
27:07;27:12;"and then well in 2015 there was the 50th anniversary of the dead"
27:12;27:14;"they're doing these huge stadium shows"
27:14;27:16;"they had Trey from Phish filling in"
27:16;27:16;"yeah"
27:16;27:17;"they had John Mayer filling in"
27:17;27:21;"they hosted the three-day festival in Chicago called Fair Thee Well"
27:21;27:26;"which was like the you know supposed end of the dead"
27:26;27:27;"like the whole run"
27:27;27:29;"Bob and Phil were gonna hang it up"
27:29;27:30;"we're done"
27:30;27:32;"it was the 20th anniversary of Jerry's death"
27:32;27:35;"because his last show was at Soldier Field in Chicago"
27:35;27:36;"in '95"
27:36;27:36;"right"
27:36;27:38;"so this is almost like the post script"
27:38;27:39;"it's like you know what man"
27:39;27:40;"we can't go out like that"
27:40;27:42;"we had so much fun at those 50th shows"
27:42;27:43;"that's what's lame"
27:43;27:44;"it's like if you're gonna go out"
27:45;27:48;"at least do what LCD did and take six years off"
27:48;27:48;"right"
27:48;27:49;"they took one year"
27:49;27:50;"you can't"
27:50;27:52;"I mean I don't think they even took a year off"
27:52;27:54;"they were out touring like last year"
27:54;27:55;"okay"
27:55;27:57;"but Phil is no longer touring"
27:57;27:59;"Phil the bass player was like I'm out"
27:59;28:00;"but Bob and"
28:00;28:03;"Bob we at least got to take off six years like LCD"
28:03;28:04;"we I'm out man"
28:04;28:07;"if you came to me with LCD model"
28:07;28:09;"I might be down but"
28:09;28:10;"I'll be 81 at that point"
28:10;28:13;"okay so anyway"
28:13;28:16;"you go to see Dead & Co at Hollywood Bowl"
28:16;28:16;"right"
28:16;28:18;"John Mayer on guitar"
28:18;28:19;"this was like back in May or June"
28:19;28:20;"back in May"
28:20;28:22;"you didn't have a great time"
28:22;28:23;"it was fun to go there with my friends"
28:23;28:26;"we got on the bus in Pasadena at the park and ride"
28:26;28:26;"yeah"
28:26;28:28;"snuck on a 12-pack"
28:28;28:30;"sitting in the back of the bus"
28:30;28:30;"sick"
28:30;28:32;"takes you down the 134"
28:32;28:32;"Modellos"
28:32;28:33;"oh yeah"
28:33;28:34;"okay"
28:34;28:35;"on brand"
28:35;28:38;"the bus takes you to the Hollywood Bowl"
28:38;28:38;"we get out there"
28:38;28:41;"there's like a really crusty lot scene"
28:41;28:43;"just a buff scene man"
28:43;28:44;"I mean like"
28:44;28:47;"just people who are like gone"
28:47;28:48;"like with a thousand yard stare"
28:48;28:49;"just like"
28:49;28:52;"just weird old hippies like selling trinkets"
28:52;28:54;"yeah well that is mellow"
28:54;28:56;"like it's more like the people who are in like their 30s or their 20s"
28:56;28:59;"who are like gacked out on something"
28:59;29:00;"and then we get into the venue"
29:00;29:02;"we got great seats"
29:02;29:04;"paid a small fortune for them"
29:04;29:07;"and I thought the show sucked"
29:07;29:09;"musically"
29:10;29:12;"and the crowd was just eating it up"
29:12;29:14;"drinking the Kool-Aid"
29:14;29:19;"you were one of the only dudes who had the balls to just say"
29:19;29:19;"yeah"
29:19;29:20;"okay so my buddy Chris"
29:20;29:21;"this is not kind"
29:21;29:22;"so my buddy"
29:22;29:23;"this is buff"
29:23;29:24;"my buddy Chris Fallon was with us"
29:24;29:27;"and he shot a little impromptu video"
29:27;29:29;"maybe like second song in"
29:29;29:30;"third song in"
29:30;29:31;"he's like"
29:31;29:32;"Jake first impressions"
29:32;29:34;"and I just kind of like went off"
29:34;29:35;"thought"
29:35;29:39;"and I said that I thought John Mayer was lame"
29:39;29:40;"and kind of tasteless"
29:40;29:42;"and not really bringing the whole lot"
29:42;29:45;"pretty generic like virtuosic guitar playing"
29:45;29:46;"anyway Chris posted it to Instagram"
29:46;29:49;"and it went on a local LA level"
29:49;29:49;"it went viral"
29:49;29:52;"because then two weeks later"
29:52;29:54;"I'm in the Home Depot in Lincoln Heights"
29:54;29:56;"and this dude comes up to me"
29:56;29:58;"he's like dude this sounds so weird"
29:58;30:00;"but straight up man"
30:00;30:01;"I saw you on Instagram yesterday"
30:01;30:03;"my buddy showed me the video"
30:03;30:06;"and it's you just like ripping into John Mayer"
30:06;30:08;"in his performance at the Dead Show"
30:08;30:10;"and I was like wait do you know Chris"
30:10;30:11;"he's like no who who's that"
30:11;30:13;"he's like no my buddy just showed me the video"
30:13;30:14;"I'm like what"
30:14;30:16;"wait didn't you say there was yet another person"
30:16;30:17;"yeah yeah and then"
30:17;30:19;"well no and then like a month"
30:19;30:19;"a month later"
30:19;30:22;"like quite a ways after I was at an art opening"
30:22;30:24;"now this guy did know Chris"
30:24;30:26;"but he was like oh hey man like"
30:26;30:28;"oh I loved you on Chris's Instagram"
30:28;30:29;"just tearing into Mayer"
30:29;30:32;"thought that was just so on point"
30:32;30:33;"I was like damn man"
30:33;30:35;"all right so we gotta"
30:35;30:37;"we gotta play the video in question"
30:37;30:39;"so this is what your buddy Chris posted"
30:39;30:42;"this is Jake ripping into John Mayer"
30:42;30:44;"this was filmed at the Hollywood Bowl concert"
30:44;30:45;"there'll be three songs in"
30:45;30:50;"there's the music"
30:50;30:51;"sounds like Clapton"
30:51;31:03;"see some bald-headed hippies"
31:03;31:05;"first impressions"
31:05;31:06;"Jake Longstrap"
31:07;31:08;"the Mayer is brutal"
31:08;31:09;"bad Mayer"
31:09;31:11;"people are like they love John Mayer"
31:11;31:12;"it's awful"
31:12;31:14;"it's not working"
31:14;31:16;"if you like Stevie Ray Vaughan that's fine"
31:16;31:18;"we're made to be seen early"
31:18;31:20;"only the third sign is set"
31:20;31:22;"none of the lyricism of Jerry"
31:22;31:22;"none of it"
31:22;31:24;"no lyricism here"
31:24;31:25;"not a lot of soul going"
31:25;31:27;"are we getting like a T.J. Friday"
31:27;31:28;"something that's like what"
31:28;31:32;"this is terrible"
31:32;31:36;"love it"
31:36;31:39;"so also just to paint the picture"
31:39;31:40;"one thing I like about this video that he posted"
31:40;31:41;"is it starts out"
31:41;31:44;"the camera's pointed at the stage"
31:44;31:47;"you see all these older hippies"
31:47;31:49;"just kind of bobbing their heads"
31:49;31:50;"having a great time"
31:50;31:51;"then you pan over to Jake"
31:51;31:53;"just looking harshed out"
31:53;31:55;"then you just start ripping it"
31:55;31:56;"it's just like a real contrast"
31:56;31:58;"everybody's just kind of hippie dancing"
31:58;31:59;"enjoying it"
31:59;31:59;"and I get it"
31:59;32:01;"people are there to have a good time"
32:01;32:02;"you know"
32:02;32:03;"people want to have a good time"
32:03;32:04;"but you"
32:04;32:05;"I wanted to have a good time"
32:05;32:07;"but I'm also not gonna relinquish all"
32:07;32:09;"critical thought about it"
32:09;32:14;"you were looking for guitar lyricism"
32:14;32:15;"that's one of the real"
32:15;32:18;"transcendent and beautiful parts"
32:18;32:19;"about the Dead's music"
32:19;32:22;"is Jerry's touch on the guitar"
32:22;32:23;"right"
32:23;32:25;"his tone and his choices"
32:25;32:26;"TTL"
32:26;32:27;"tone, touch, and lyricism"
32:27;32:29;"that's what makes a good guitarist"
32:29;32:32;"I mean Jerry was an incredibly unique guitarist"
32:33;32:36;"there's very few really distinct guitarists"
32:36;32:37;"where you're like"
32:37;32:38;"oh that's them playing that solo"
32:38;32:40;"so in the video you said"
32:40;32:41;"this is cool if you like Stevie Ray Vaughan"
32:41;32:43;"because you're not a fan of SRV"
32:43;32:43;"not really"
32:43;32:46;"I mean I know people are ride or die SRV"
32:46;32:47;"it just sounds like"
32:47;32:48;"some fake Jimi Hendrix"
32:48;32:50;"yeah it just sounds like a really accomplished"
32:50;32:52;"bar band"
32:52;32:53;"like blues"
32:53;32:53;"right"
32:53;32:54;"you know Texas blues"
32:54;32:56;"I like this conversation"
32:56;32:57;"because I think it also"
32:57;32:58;"on the show we talk so much about"
32:58;33:01;"the tasteful palette of the 1970s"
33:01;33:04;"and I think sometimes people get a twist"
33:04;33:06;"and say well is that all you need"
33:06;33:08;"to make good music in Jake's book"
33:08;33:10;"all you need is the tasteful palette of 70s stuff"
33:10;33:13;"no you also need tone, touch, and lyricism"
33:13;33:14;"you need good songs"
33:14;33:16;"oh and good songs"
33:16;33:18;"that's happened before on this show"
33:18;33:19;"where like we're listening to like"
33:19;33:21;"some random top five from like the 70s"
33:21;33:23;"and even with that palette"
33:23;33:23;"and you're like"
33:23;33:25;"what it's the perfect palette"
33:25;33:25;"you don't like it"
33:25;33:26;"come on bro"
33:26;33:27;"it doesn't have"
33:27;33:28;"it's not just the palette"
33:28;33:30;"the band Bread"
33:30;33:30;"yeah"
33:30;33:31;"the band America"
33:31;33:32;"great palettes"
33:32;33:34;"bad songs"
33:34;33:37;"I mean I can get down with a couple America songs"
33:37;33:38;"lyricism"
33:38;33:39;"tone and touch"
33:39;33:41;"TTL"
33:41;33:41;"good tone"
33:41;33:43;"good tone"
33:43;33:44;"decent touch"
33:44;33:47;"not a lot of lyricism"
33:47;33:49;"I wanted"
33:49;33:51;"I used to have these like superhero trading cards"
33:51;33:52;"when I was a kid"
33:52;33:54;"like X-Men trading cards"
33:54;33:55;"and it's actually learned a lot of words from them"
33:55;33:57;"because I was probably like eight or nine"
33:57;33:57;"and you'd like flip over"
33:57;33:59;"be like Wolverine"
33:59;34:00;"it'd be like stamina"
34:00;34:00;"oh yeah"
34:00;34:00;"nine"
34:01;34:03;"and I just remember this is the first time"
34:03;34:05;"I've ever heard the word stamina"
34:05;34:06;"strength"
34:06;34:06;"ten"
34:06;34:07;"power"
34:07;34:08;"we should do like"
34:08;34:11;"70s musician trading cards"
34:11;34:12;"one on the back"
34:12;34:12;"tone"
34:12;34:13;"touch"
34:13;34:15;"lyricism"
34:15;34:16;"so America would be like tone"
34:16;34:17;"nine"
34:17;34:18;"touch"
34:18;34:19;"eight"
34:19;34:20;"lyricism"
34:20;34:20;"two"
34:20;34:21;"four"
34:21;34:21;"four"
34:22;34:25;"well I tried to make it Sunday"
34:25;34:28;"but I got so damn depressed"
34:28;34:32;"that I set my sights on Monday"
34:32;34:36;"and I got myself undressed"
34:36;34:40;"I ain't ready for the altar"
34:40;34:43;"but I do agree there's times"
34:43;34:47;"when a woman sure can be a friend of mine"
34:50;34:54;"well I keep on thinking about you"
34:54;34:57;"sister golden hair surprise"
34:57;35:01;"and I just can't live without you"
35:01;35:04;"can't you see it in my eyes"
35:04;35:07;"I've been one poor, poorest part"
35:07;35:11;"I've been too, too far to find"
35:11;35:13;"but it doesn't mean"
35:13;35:15;"you ain't been on my mind"
35:18;35:22;"will you meet me in the middle"
35:22;35:24;"will you meet me in the end"
35:24;35:29;"will you love me just a little"
35:29;35:31;"just be a fact to show you care"
35:31;35:35;"well I tried to fake it"
35:35;35:36;"I don't mind saying"
35:36;35:38;"I just can't make it"
35:38;35:40;"time crisis"
35:40;35:42;"well speaking of America"
35:42;35:47;"Jake you did some real digging the past week"
35:47;35:50;"and you came across a band"
35:50;35:51;"that I'd never heard of"
35:51;35:52;"that we need to talk about"
35:52;35:55;"yeah Madison Rising"
35:55;35:57;"okay so Madison Rising"
35:57;36:01;"bills themselves as America's most patriotic rock band"
36:01;36:03;"yeah well a little backstory"
36:03;36:04;"yeah how did you find them?"
36:04;36:06;"I was reading about the Juggalo March"
36:06;36:06;"right"
36:06;36:08;"in DC"
36:08;36:12;"which obviously that's the most 2017 fascinating thing ever"
36:12;36:16;"and for people who have been living under a rock for the past 20 years"
36:16;36:19;"Juggalos are fans of the Insane Clown Posse"
36:19;36:20;"it's bigger than just a fandom though"
36:20;36:22;"it's kind of a culture and a lifestyle"
36:22;36:25;"the Juggalos have been classified as a gang by the FBI"
36:25;36:28;"so they're marching on DC to kind of you know"
36:28;36:28;"fight for their rights"
36:28;36:29;"just explain that they're"
36:29;36:30;"yeah"
36:30;36:31;"they shouldn't be discriminated"
36:31;36:32;"that is kind of crazy"
36:32;36:35;"I mean it'd be like saying the Deadheads are a gang"
36:35;36:37;"and there were a lot of like sad stories"
36:37;36:39;"in this long article I read on the AV Club"
36:39;36:40;"about the Juggalo March"
36:40;36:43;"about like people with like Juggalo tattoos"
36:44;36:48;"who then like lost custody of their kids in like a court case"
36:48;36:50;"because they had like Juggalo tattoos"
36:50;36:52;"and that's like a gang affiliation"
36:52;36:53;"so it's really no joke"
36:53;36:57;"literally there's people's rights are being compromised"
36:57;36:58;"or straight up violated"
36:58;37:02;"because some judge somewhere in Ohio is like"
37:02;37:04;"well sir as a member of a gang"
37:04;37:07;"the state cannot permit you to like be in your child's life"
37:07;37:09;"okay so it's really bad"
37:09;37:10;"oh yeah yeah that's why they did it"
37:10;37:11;"it wasn't just like a joke"
37:11;37:12;"yeah"
37:12;37:14;"I mean it is funny"
37:14;37:16;"obviously the Juggalos marching on DC"
37:16;37:17;"if you zoom out it's funny"
37:17;37:19;"and I think Juggalos have a sense of humor"
37:19;37:21;"about the fact that they wear face paint and stuff"
37:21;37:22;"but no you're right"
37:22;37:23;"that's really serious"
37:23;37:24;"that they're being targeted that way"
37:24;37:26;"so there was this big march"
37:26;37:28;"and then a lot of speakers"
37:28;37:30;"and then a band played"
37:30;37:31;"well ICP played"
37:31;37:34;"and then a band called Madison Rising also played"
37:34;37:38;"and I was reading the description of the whole march"
37:38;37:40;"and that name caught my eye"
37:40;37:42;"I was like who's Madison Rising"
37:43;37:45;"and then I looked at their Wikipedia page"
37:45;37:50;"and self-described their biggest influence is Creed"
37:50;38:00;"and it's like Ted Nugent level quote-unquote patriotism"
38:00;38:04;"with like the most guitar center"
38:04;38:08;"you know like just pathetic kind of like proto-grunge"
38:08;38:11;"it's like a band you would see on like the Simpsons"
38:12;38:13;"except it's real"
38:13;38:16;"it kind of seems like a fake band"
38:16;38:16;"yeah"
38:16;38:18;"but they had Madison Rising on the bill"
38:18;38:25;"and this is live before the nationwide NASCAR race at Daytona"
38:25;38:36;"that's too funny"
38:36;38:38;"that would be Creedence Clearwater Revival"
38:38;38:42;"yeah first of all not America's most patriotic rock band"
38:42;38:44;"who do you think who is the most patriotic rock band?"
38:44;38:45;"Vampire Weekend"
38:45;38:45;"Fugazi"
38:45;38:47;"Grateful Dead"
38:47;38:49;"Bruce Springsteen"
38:49;38:53;"okay so just to paint the picture"
38:53;38:55;"this guy's holding a folded up American flag"
38:55;38:56;"the singer"
38:56;39:10;"he's got kind of like a little chin goatee"
39:18;39:21;"all the NASCAR drivers are like befuddled expressions"
39:21;39:24;"they're all wearing Oakleys"
39:24;39:31;"okay get the tom beat going"
39:31;39:32;"yeah the drums come in"
39:44;39:45;"watched"
39:51;39:52;"here we go taking some liberty"
39:52;40:00;"also the mitts"
40:00;40:01;"I guess they're setting off fireworks"
40:01;40:03;"it's like drums and vocals"
40:03;40:15;"and the dudes in the band are rocking out so hard"
40:15;40:16;"yeah"
40:16;40:20;"there's like some military dudes saluting"
40:20;40:21;"I wonder what's going through their head"
40:21;40:24;"oh wait hold on"
40:24;40:24;"we better"
40:30;40:31;"that's pure Creed"
40:33;40:34;"Creed would do this better"
40:34;40:35;"that's the funny part"
40:35;40:40;"this is almost a little like Tenacious D too"
40:40;40:41;"oh totally"
40:41;40:45;"good lord"
40:45;40:48;"for the land"
40:48;40:51;"I also just love the fact that like"
40:51;40:54;"these guys just like changing the melody"
40:54;40:55;"changing all this stuff"
40:55;40:57;"just imagine if it's like a liberal band"
40:57;40:58;"got up there and like did this"
40:58;41:00;"it'd be like Fox News headline"
41:00;41:02;"just like disgusting travesty"
41:02;41:04;"Jeff Tweedy and Wilco"
41:04;41:07;"disparaging our national anthem"
41:07;41:09;"bunch of libtards"
41:09;41:09;"think they can just"
41:09;41:13;"add some grindcore to the national anthem"
41:13;41:16;"for the land"
41:16;41:18;"oh like if it was a liberal band"
41:18;41:20;"that had that exact aesthetic"
41:20;41:21;"yeah that'd be amazing"
41:21;41:23;"it was like a high school band"
41:23;41:24;"so Tenacious D"
41:24;41:25;"I just want to point out for people that"
41:25;41:29;"in this video that insane music you just heard"
41:29;41:30;"is being performed in front of"
41:30;41:33;"like legitimately maybe like 500,000 people"
41:33;41:34;"it's a giant event"
41:34;41:36;"everybody has to like keep a straight face"
41:36;41:37;"just like yeah"
41:37;41:39;"um they also do originals"
41:39;41:40;"yeah I found the one"
41:40;41:42;"I sent you one called Right to Bear"
41:42;41:44;"yeah we should listen a little bit to Right to Bear"
41:44;41:45;"this is brutal"
41:45;41:49;"so here's Madison Rising with Right to Bear"
41:55;41:56;"opens with a 911 call"
42:07;42:09;"this song's from 2012"
42:09;42:10;"not 1996"
42:22;42:25;"it's real like like a candlebox deep cut"
42:25;42:27;"yeah by little Alice in Chains"
42:41;42:42;"hold on I just want to point out"
42:42;42:42;"what those lyrics"
42:42;42:44;"in case people weren't catching the lyrics"
42:44;42:45;"this is the opening verse"
42:45;42:48;"late one night as I came home"
42:48;42:50;"and saw the front door broken in"
42:50;42:53;"I grabbed my piece and went inside"
42:53;42:55;"it's like a Charles Bronson movie"
42:55;42:56;"to see who lurks within"
42:56;42:58;"that's so Tenacious D"
42:58;42:58;"is like"
42:58;42:59;"that's"
42:59;43:00;"I love this aesthetic"
43:00;43:02;"Tenacious D does the exact same thing"
43:02;43:04;"although I don't think they would write"
43:04;43:07;"as like a straight song about pro gun"
43:07;43:09;"I think it's that same type of kind of like"
43:09;43:12;"goofy like trying to sound like classic rock"
43:12;43:14;"or like cool 90s rock"
43:14;43:14;"right"
43:14;43:15;"so I just like love this"
43:15;43:16;"late one night as I came home"
43:16;43:17;"and saw the front door broken in"
43:17;43:19;"I grabbed my piece and went inside"
43:19;43:20;"to see who lurks within"
43:20;43:21;"so it's like that"
43:21;43:23;"even just to change the lyrics"
43:23;43:24;"into that kind of like"
43:24;43:26;"like stilted old-fashioned"
43:26;43:27;"- It's like Zeppelin"
43:27;43:29;"- It's so Zeppelin to be like"
43:29;43:30;"- Lurks within"
43:30;43:31;"- To see who lurks within"
43:31;43:33;"- It's so Tenacious D"
43:33;43:35;"is just to like suddenly out of nowhere"
43:35;43:37;"have a line just to make it rhyme"
43:37;43:38;"where you're just like"
43:38;43:39;"talking like normal American speech"
43:39;43:41;"to see who lurks within"
43:41;43:43;"- It's so high school"
43:43;43:45;"- There we stood face to face"
43:45;43:47;"my gun the thief and I"
43:47;43:49;"also to say and I"
43:49;43:52;"- The gun the thief and I"
43:52;43:54;"man you should have seen him run"
43:54;43:56;"when I cocked that 45"
43:56;43:58;"God"
43:58;43:59;"and then the"
43:59;44:00;"disarmed our rights will disappear"
44:00;44:01;"we won't let it happen here"
44:01;44:02;"this is the chorus"
44:02;44:06;"- Because one of my rights has a free man"
44:06;44:09;"to protect my home when I need it"
44:09;44:13;"I demand my right to bear"
44:13;44:18;"I demand my right to bear"
44:18;44:19;"pause"
44:19;44:20;"- Arms"
44:22;44:23;"this is insane"
44:23;44:25;"the funny thing is"
44:25;44:27;"this came out in 2012"
44:27;44:29;"it only has about 300,000 views"
44:29;44:30;"so I feel like"
44:30;44:30;"you know what"
44:30;44:31;"- It's a niche band"
44:31;44:33;"- Even the right wingers"
44:33;44:36;"you know whatever side of the political spectrum"
44:36;44:36;"you're on"
44:36;44:38;"it's just like left wingers like"
44:38;44:41;"you know you like when you know that an artist has"
44:41;44:44;"some shared morality with you"
44:44;44:45;"but you know if they play too hard"
44:45;44:49;"you know even like liberal Bernie bros like us"
44:49;44:51;"if you know Pearl Jam came out with a new song"
44:51;44:52;"that was like"
44:52;44:56;"we gotta support socialism"
44:56;44:57;"medicare for all"
44:57;45:01;"his name was Bernie Sanders"
45:01;45:02;"we just feel like this sucks"
45:02;45:02;"- Yeah"
45:02;45:04;"- So even I'm sure there's some right wingers who love"
45:04;45:05;"Alice in Chains and Zeppelin"
45:05;45:07;"they're like okay you know what"
45:07;45:08;"- A little on the nose guys"
45:08;45:10;"- Yeah like I do support the right to bear arms"
45:10;45:12;"but I don't need this"
45:12;45:13;"- And also like this story"
45:13;45:14;"like they're like"
45:14;45:16;"it's a story about like killing someone"
45:16;45:18;"in your house"
45:18;45:21;"and it has like the emotional palette"
45:21;45:23;"of like a hard rock song"
45:23;45:24;"and like a strip club"
45:24;45:25;"- Yeah"
45:25;45:26;"- Like it has none of the like"
45:26;45:29;"resonance that it really should"
45:29;45:31;"given like how gnarly the subject matter is"
45:31;45:33;"- I guess to be fair to Madison Rising"
45:33;45:34;"in this story"
45:34;45:37;"he's not actually killing the thief"
45:37;45:38;"- Oh he's just chasing them off?"
45:38;45:41;"- I know this is also just like the perfect right wing version"
45:41;45:42;"of how gun rights go"
45:42;45:42;"- Right"
45:42;45:44;"- If you come home the door is broken in"
45:44;45:45;"- Perfect scenario"
45:45;45:46;"- Also he grabbed his piece"
45:46;45:48;"went inside to see who lurks within"
45:48;45:49;"he sees the thief"
45:49;45:50;"- He's face to face with him"
45:50;45:51;"- Cocks that 45"
45:51;45:52;"the coward ran away"
45:52;45:54;"- It's like a Dirty Harry movie"
45:54;45:56;"- Yeah and then it's like you know"
45:56;45:57;"he called the locksmith"
45:57;45:58;"fixed the lock"
45:58;45:59;"slept soundly"
45:59;46:00;"that's that"
46:00;46:01;"- 45 under the pillow"
46:01;46:03;"- I just like wanted like a version that's like"
46:03;46:06;"and then I cocked my 45"
46:06;46:08;"he shot me in the arm"
46:08;46:10;"I thought that I'd die"
46:10;46:11;"he beat the shit out of me"
46:11;46:13;"like the gun jammed"
46:13;46:17;"random fire from my piece"
46:17;46:19;"went into the neighbor's house"
46:20;46:21;"killing my elderly neighbor"
46:21;46:23;"it's a small price to pay"
46:23;46:25;"I couldn't let that thief get away"
46:25;46:29;"- Yeah like yeah perfect story man"
46:29;46:31;"all right well check out Madison Rising or don't"
46:31;46:34;"America's"
46:34;46:38;"I'm gonna say least patriotic rock band"
46:38;46:40;"if you want to check out a patriotic rock band"
46:40;46:42;"check out Bruce"
46:42;46:43;"- You know what?"
46:43;46:45;"- Honestly even Led Zeppelin's more patriotic"
46:45;46:48;"- I'm gonna make a true patriotic playlist"
46:48;46:50;"- Oh I love that"
46:50;46:50;"- Yeah"
46:50;46:52;"- Jake making a true"
46:52;46:53;"okay I love that"
46:53;46:54;"I want to see Jake's takes"
46:54;46:58;"on what it really means to be an American rock fan"
46:58;46:59;"because the right-wingers"
46:59;47:02;"because rock apparently is dead"
47:02;47:04;"the liberals don't care about rock anymore"
47:04;47:07;"because you know we don't turn up to rock anymore"
47:07;47:08;"- That's true"
47:08;47:10;"it'll be interesting to see what the"
47:10;47:13;"most recent song on the patriotic playlist will be"
47:13;47:15;"- Right"
47:15;47:16;"- It probably won't be"
47:16;47:17;"- A sheer mag"
47:17;47:18;"- Okay actually yeah"
47:18;47:19;"- Do they have any patriotic songs?"
47:19;47:20;"- Oh yeah no"
47:20;47:20;"- Yeah yeah"
47:20;47:22;"- Their politics are super like engaged with"
47:22;47:25;"kind of lefty engagement"
47:25;47:25;"- Yeah yeah"
47:25;47:27;"- A sheer mag"
47:32;47:37;"idol lover"
47:37;47:40;"lovin' ya"
47:40;47:50;"♫"
48:00;48:03;"From the sorrow we created"
48:03;48:06;"A fragile state of blood and wind"
48:06;48:10;"People rich, men and their white skin"
48:10;48:12;"People bolder than I"
48:12;48:15;"Stood up to the lie"
48:15;48:19;"That is what I did, I let my mind"
48:19;48:22;"But there is no doubt in my mind"
48:22;48:25;"I've been reading the news and you surely regret"
48:25;48:28;"If you don't give up the fight"
48:28;48:31;"Expect the bayonet"
48:31;48:37;"Well, expect the bayonet"
48:37;48:40;"Yeah, yeah"
48:40;48:43;"Expect the bayonet"
48:43;48:54;"Don't say I didn't want ya"
48:54;48:58;"'Cause forever a man I fall apart"
48:58;49:01;"There's a dark blue board buried in the fog"
49:01;49:04;"How naked is your eye?"
49:04;49:07;"Do you ever wonder why?"
49:07;49:10;"You say you're mad, you're like a mad man"
49:10;49:13;"But it's the last sign of your defense"
49:13;49:16;"Are you better ashamed or you surely regret"
49:16;49:19;"If you don't give up the fight"
49:19;49:22;"Expect the bayonet"
49:23;49:27;"Well, expect the bayonet"
49:27;49:32;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
49:32;49:35;"When the night came down"
49:35;49:38;"I caught my hands and ran down"
49:38;49:41;"Falling in the middle of the sea"
49:41;49:44;"But come night, we'll never cross that river"
49:44;49:47;"'Cause I'm alone"
49:48;49:51;"We're not all alone"
49:51;49:54;"The fallen man's heart is finally burnt"
49:54;49:57;"For pity's the only thing he deserves"
49:57;50:00;"When the dark whistle is ringing"
50:00;50:03;"It's the currency that they're dealing"
50:03;50:06;"So before the world we're doomed to sink"
50:06;50:09;"Solidarity's for those on the front"
50:09;50:12;"Are you better a man or you surely regret"
50:12;50:16;"If you don't give up the fight"
50:16;50:19;"Expect the bayonet"
50:19;50:25;"Well, expect the bayonet"
50:25;50:28;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
50:28;50:31;"Expect the bayonet"
50:31;50:37;"Well, expect the bayonet"
50:37;50:40;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
50:40;50:43;"Expect the bayonet"
50:43;50:47;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
50:47;50:48;"Hey, man, how are you?"
50:48;50:49;"Hey, what's up, man?"
50:49;50:50;"How are you doing?"
50:50;50:51;"I'm very well. Hello, Seth."
50:51;50:53;"How's it going? Nice to see you, Colin."
50:53;50:54;"How are we doing? What are we talking about?"
50:54;50:55;"This is your show, Ezra."
50:55;50:57;"Yeah, this is my show. Yeah, Time Crisis."
50:57;50:58;"Time Crisis."
50:58;50:59;"This is my ghost, Jake."
50:59;51:00;"How are you?"
51:00;51:01;"Jake."
51:01;51:02;"You're ghosted in that corner."
51:02;51:04;"Why are you standing, Jake?"
51:04;51:08;"Is it to make you feel superior to us or inferior to us?"
51:08;51:09;"You choose."
51:09;51:11;"I like standing. I can focus."
51:11;51:14;"Choose. Inferior or superior."
51:14;51:15;"Let's open it up to the corners."
51:15;51:16;"You always stand."
51:16;51:18;"I feel like if I sit over there, it's too far."
51:18;51:20;"I like to sort of be right here."
51:20;51:22;"You can get one person standing."
51:22;51:23;"What are we talking about today, Ezra?"
51:23;51:27;"Well, for Time Crisis listeners, we just got a James Corden drop in."
51:27;51:29;"[trumpet fanfare]"
51:29;51:30;"Welcome, James."
51:30;51:33;"Hey, what's going on with the traffic and the weather out there today, Ezra?"
51:33;51:34;"Oh, yeah, we cover classic rock."
51:34;51:37;"Everywhere I go, all anyone's telling me is, oh, it's not really a radio show like that."
51:37;51:40;"And I'm like, well, where do you-- how do you get the calls, texts, faxes?"
51:40;51:43;"Coming in. 8-double-1-double-9, 3-9, 2-6."
51:43;51:46;"That's right, and this is The Monster Mash."
51:46;51:47;"We can play The Monster Mash, though, right?"
51:47;51:49;"You tell me you've got The Monster Mash."
51:49;51:52;"We don't even play that much music on this show, to be honest."
51:52;51:54;"We talk about music."
51:54;51:56;"But how is-- come on."
51:56;51:57;"We have listener emails."
51:57;52:03;"How is the lead singer of Vampire Weekend not doing a Halloween special with The Monster Mash?"
52:03;52:04;"That's all I'm saying."
52:04;52:05;"I do--"
52:05;52:06;"Because that in itself is a crisis."
52:06;52:07;"I do love Halloween music."
52:07;52:14;"I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight."
52:14;52:18;"So what, this show is just people hanging out with their friends just chatting?"
52:18;52:19;"Yeah, is that--"
52:19;52:20;"Can you cuss?"
52:20;52:21;"That's what people do."
52:21;52:22;"Can you cuss on this show?"
52:22;52:24;"Yeah, you can cuss, but then they always bleep it out."
52:24;52:26;"Mother [bleep] bleep that [bleep]"
52:26;52:29;"We're having a real good time in here."
52:29;52:31;"Okay, so what were we talking about?"
52:31;52:36;"Eric Clapton was being interviewed, and they asked him about declining guitar sales"
52:36;52:39;"because every year guitar sales are down."
52:39;52:41;"[explosion]"
52:41;52:42;"Now he's got it."
52:42;52:43;"See that?"
52:43;52:44;"Exactly."
52:44;52:45;"The big dog's been dying."
52:45;52:47;"He's been dying to have some sound effects."
52:47;52:48;"We have sound effects on the show."
52:48;52:49;"[air horn]"
52:49;52:53;"So guitar sales were down from 1.5 million last year to a million."
52:53;52:54;"Oh, wow."
52:54;52:55;"Guitar sales are hurting."
52:55;53:00;"And they asked Eric Clapton what he thought about this, and he just said, ""Eh, maybe guitar's over."""
53:00;53:05;"Well, I think there's a bigger question, which is I don't think the guitar is over, I think."
53:05;53:10;"And this is the saddest thing by proxy from that is that I think bands might be over,"
53:10;53:13;"and that makes me so sad because it used to be if you were at school,"
53:13;53:17;"you were like one person at school when I want to be in a band."
53:17;53:18;"Yeah."
53:18;53:22;"Oh, and then you met some guy that you didn't really know, and were like, ""Oh, you play bass? Awesome."""
53:22;53:24;"And he'd go, ""Yeah, yeah."" And you know, ""Jimmy plays guitar."""
53:24;53:26;"And you'd be like, ""Great."" And they'd go, ""We need a drummer."""
53:26;53:28;"And they're like, ""Well, you know, there's that guy who plays in the orchestra."""
53:28;53:31;"And you're like, ""Great."" And you form a band because you need those things."
53:31;53:37;"Now, with a laptop and all those things, that same person that's gone, ""I want to form a band,"""
53:37;53:42;"goes, ""Well, I don't need to go in."" In a world where almost conversation is dying,"
53:42;53:47;"you're in a world where everything is becoming an insular, singular process."
53:47;53:48;"Even more alone."
53:48;53:54;"What you watch, what you consume is about, you know, I watch it now, there's no shared experiences."
53:54;53:58;"And that is the greater worry. And I think that's why guitar sales are down."
53:58;54:02;"Because ultimately, kids are like, ""Oh, I want to join a band. I'm going to be in a band."""
54:02;54:04;"And then you're being in a band, and then you're like, ""Oh, people think we're cool."""
54:04;54:07;"And then you go, ""If I get a new guitar, maybe I'll get laid, and then we'll get better."""
54:07;54:09;"And that's it. And it all comes down to that."
54:09;54:14;"Whereas then suddenly, you're like, ""Calvin Harris seems to be doing pretty well. I'll do that."""
54:14;54:20;"At best, maybe you want to be like the chain smokers. You just need one other guy. At best."
54:20;54:22;"But more likely, it'd just be Calvin Harris solo."
54:22;54:29;"Yeah, or worse than that, even if you form a band now, are a record company going to sign that band?"
54:29;54:33;"Because you could be a really good band, and I don't even know if a record company is going to sign that band"
54:33;54:37;"in a world where it just seems to be a mass of solo artists."
54:37;54:38;"Kids still form bands, I think."
54:38;54:39;"Do they?"
54:39;54:41;"I don't know. Were you in a band? Were you ever in bands?"
54:41;54:42;"Oh, man, was I? Yeah."
54:42;54:43;"Oh, I didn't know that."
54:43;54:44;"Yeah, yeah."
54:44;54:45;"What kind of music?"
54:45;54:46;"A lot of Queen covers."
54:46;54:47;"Oh, really?"
54:47;54:48;"Yeah, a lot of Queen covers."
54:48;54:49;"What were you doing?"
54:49;54:50;"Singer?"
54:50;54:51;"Frontman, buddy."
54:51;54:52;"Frontman."
54:52;54:53;"Drummer."
54:53;54:57;"He has a great voice. So you were singing like big Freddie Mercury style?"
54:57;55:02;"Well, so the first band I was in, we weren't really a band. It was a boy band."
55:02;55:06;"And we were called Full Frontal. But we never really did anything."
55:06;55:09;"We just walked around telling people that we were a band. We never really did anything."
55:09;55:14;"Then I formed a band at school called Twice Shy."
55:14;55:18;"And the reason was so that our first album would be called Once Bitten."
55:18;55:20;"Sick."
55:20;55:23;"Oh, yeah. Big time. And that was a lot of Queen covers."
55:23;55:26;"And then I formed another boy band called Insatiable."
55:26;55:29;"You know why? Because you just can't get enough."
55:29;55:30;"Whoa."
55:30;55:31;"[Sings]"
55:31;55:35;"I love the boy band. Maybe you could still form a boy band without guitars."
55:35;55:39;"That's true. Well, the forming of a boy band was because I really love dancing and singing."
55:39;55:43;"But I don't-- My greatest regret in life is that I gave up on the piano."
55:43;55:47;"You never meet anyone who goes, ""Oh, I really regret learning the piano."""
55:47;55:50;"Right. My parents forced me to, and I'm glad."
55:50;55:53;"Yeah. And that's what I'm now doing with my son, which is--"
55:53;55:57;"I'm teaching my son is passionate about learning the guitar."
55:57;55:59;"Can you play guitar at all?"
55:59;56:03;"No. I played a tiny bit on this film Begin Again, where I learned just literally six chords."
56:03;56:04;"The most basic, right?"
56:04;56:06;"Yeah. It was really basic."
56:06;56:07;"It's never too late."
56:07;56:08;"It's a bit too late."
56:08;56:09;"[Sings]"
56:09;56:13;"When I dropped down at the car wash, I left my mama a goodbye note."
56:13;56:17;"By sundown, I'd left Kingston with my guitar under my coat."
56:17;56:21;"I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis, got a room at the YMCA."
56:21;56:26;"For the next three weeks, I went hunting them nightclubs looking for a place to play."
56:26;56:31;"Well, I thought my figure would set 'em on fire, but nobody wanted to hire a guitar man."
56:31;56:34;"[Guitar music]"
56:34;56:36;"Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis."
56:36;56:42;"I'd run out of money and luck, so I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia, on an overloaded polka truck."
56:42;56:47;"I thumbed on down to Panama City, started picking out some of them all-night bars."
56:47;56:51;"I was hoping I could make myself a dollar making music on my guitar."
56:51;56:53;"I got the same old story with them all-night peers."
56:53;56:56;"There ain't no room around here for a guitar man."
56:56;56:59;"We don't need a guitar man, son."
56:59;57:01;"So I slept in the hobo jungles."
57:01;57:06;"I roamed a thousand miles to track 'til I found myself in Mobile, Alabama."
57:06;57:08;"Had a club named Big Jacks."
57:08;57:12;"A little four-piece band was jamming, so I took my guitar and I set in."
57:12;57:15;"I showed 'em what a band would sound like with a swinging little guitar man."
57:15;57:17;"Show 'em, son."
57:17;57:19;"So did you write boy band songs?"
57:19;57:21;"Yeah, man. What's the big deal, bro?"
57:21;57:23;"What were some of the titles?"
57:23;57:25;"We had a song called ""Girl Are You Ready?"""
57:25;57:27;"""Girl Are You Ready?"""
57:27;57:29;"Yeah, which the chorus went, ""Girl, are you ready?"
57:29;57:31;"""Just tell me when you're ready. Girl, are you ready?"
57:31;57:33;"""I ain't gonna rush you."""
57:33;57:36;"Which in hindsight sounds like you really might be rushing her."
57:36;57:38;"You probably only need to say it once."
57:38;57:41;"So that was our first, and then we had another song called ""Lover,"""
57:41;57:43;"which was a real big ballad."
57:43;57:45;"Wait, so this was serious?"
57:45;57:47;"No, it wasn't that serious."
57:47;57:50;"But there was a summer where we were serious, and then we all got jobs."
57:50;57:52;"But when you sat down and wrote ""Girl Are You Ready?"""
57:52;57:55;"you were really just trying to think, ""Maybe this could be a hit."""
57:55;57:58;"This is a number one record. We'll probably close with this on the tour."
57:58;58:00;"But when did you write your first song?"
58:00;58:06;"The first one that I really remember is when I was probably like 11 or 12."
58:06;58:08;"It was called ""Bad Birthday Party."""
58:08;58:10;"It was kind of like a '50s ballad, like..."
58:10;58:11;"# Dun-dun-dun-dun #"
58:11;58:14;"And I just remember the chorus went, # Bad birthday party"
58:14;58:16;"# Why you so bad?"
58:16;58:19;"# Worst birthday party I ever had. #"
58:19;58:21;"And was it based on a true experience?"
58:21;58:23;"Did you have a bad birthday party?"
58:23;58:26;"I more or less had very good birthday parties,"
58:26;58:28;"but I think I'd probably been to a bad birthday party."
58:28;58:31;"At a young age, you know when you're a kid,"
58:31;58:35;"a bad birthday party is kind of like the saddest thing you can think of."
58:35;58:36;"Yeah."
58:36;58:38;"You go to some kid's house, and nobody shows up,"
58:38;58:40;"and there's not enough people."
58:40;58:43;"Because nobody's getting their heart broken at that age."
58:43;58:46;"A bad birthday party is the closest thing to getting dumped."
58:46;58:47;"For sure."
58:47;58:49;"That's like an 11-year-old Sam Smith song."
58:49;58:50;"It's like ""Bad Birthday Party."""
58:50;58:51;"""Bad Birthday Party."""
58:51;58:52;"Yeah, exactly."
58:52;58:53;"That's it. That's it. Yeah."
58:53;58:55;"""Bad Birthday Party."""
58:55;58:57;"When did you first write a song that you were like,"
58:57;58:59;"""Oh, this is a good song""?"
58:59;59:04;"I feel like I wrote a couple decent ones when I was more like 15."
59:04;59:06;"You know, like high school age."
59:06;59:08;"Where were the good ones from back there?"
59:08;59:11;"That's when I started to get a little more pretentious."
59:11;59:14;"There was like-- I remember we had kind of--"
59:14;59:15;"I remember we had kind of--"
59:15;59:18;"This is my band with my friends in my hometown."
59:18;59:19;"Which was called?"
59:19;59:21;"The Sophisticuffs."
59:21;59:24;"Oh, that's a good name. That is a good name."
59:24;59:26;"Shout out to Steve Condor, I believe."
59:26;59:27;"Steve-O. Great name."
59:27;59:28;"He made that up."
59:28;59:31;"I remember we had a song that was almost like a Velvet Underground song"
59:31;59:34;"that was called ""Odysseus Says."""
59:34;59:36;"Because we probably read ""The Odyssey"" in high school,"
59:36;59:37;"so I just remember it was like,"
59:37;59:40;"""Odysseus says, na-na-na-na-na-na,"
59:40;59:43;"""he took a seed as he ate the eucalyptus."
59:43;59:45;"""Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, scilla and charybdis."""
59:45;59:46;"It was like--"
59:46;59:47;"And were you the front man?"
59:47;59:48;"Yeah."
59:48;59:49;"Were you doing it that low?"
59:49;59:51;"""Odysseus says, 'Bout to eat the eucalyptus."""
59:51;59:53;"It sounds like something on a kid's TV show."
59:53;59:54;"A little."
59:54;59:57;"""Odysseus says, and everybody gonna listen."""
59:57;59:59;"I should probably bring that back. I could do it."
59:59;01:00:00;"""Eating eucalyptus."""
01:00:00;01:00:01;"Yeah, exactly."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"""Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum."""
01:00:03;01:00:04;"Oh, this is huge."
01:00:04;01:00:06;"Yeah, I should dig back to some of this stuff."
01:00:06;01:00:10;"But then I think that I really felt like I wrote songs I really liked"
01:00:10;01:00:11;"probably when I was 21."
01:00:11;01:00:14;"That's when, like, the Vampire Weekend era started."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Yeah, Adele had a good year at 21."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Oh, yeah, she got started earlier."
01:00:18;01:00:21;"I could not have made a 19 album."
01:00:21;01:00:22;"That would not have been pretty."
01:00:22;01:00:23;"Really?"
01:00:23;01:00:24;"I wouldn't have been ready."
01:00:24;01:00:25;"Bad birthday parties."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Yeah, I still would have had a bad birthday party on it."
01:00:27;01:00:29;"Would you rather--"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"'cause I once said this to Phil Collins."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"I was like, ""If you could have--"
01:00:33;01:00:34;"Don't-- wait."""
01:00:34;01:00:35;"No, no, we're Phil Collins."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"Are you f***ing dissing Phil Collins?"
01:00:36;01:00:37;"No, no, we talk about--"
01:00:37;01:00:38;"What the f*** just happened there?"
01:00:38;01:00:39;"No, no, we're team--"
01:00:39;01:00:40;"Don't diss Phil Collins on my watch."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"We're team Phil. We talk about him so much."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"He's unbelievable."
01:00:42;01:00:44;"We took his side in his beef with Paul McCartney."
01:00:44;01:00:45;"That's a whole 'nother story."
01:00:45;01:00:46;"He's unbelievable."
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Yeah, no, we love him."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"So I said to Phil Collins, ""Would you--"
01:00:49;01:00:54;"""if someone said, 'Your life will get rid of all of the heartache and pain,"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"""but you won't have the songs,"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"""or you keep the heartache and pain, but you do have the songs?'"""
01:01:00;01:01:02;"And he went, ""Oh, I keep the songs every day of the week."""
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Really?"
01:01:03;01:01:04;"Yeah."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"Yeah, I mean, so would I."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"I think-- I mean, I feel pretty good right now."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"Yeah, I guess you'd have to get somebody at their lowest point, though."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Yeah."
01:01:12;01:01:14;"Songwriting is a good way to kind of, like,"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"take some of, like, the ups and downs of life"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"and turn it into something positive."
01:01:17;01:01:20;"Let's go 'Round the Room, best Phil Collins song."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"Best Phil Collins song."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"It's too basic to say in the air tonight."
01:01:24;01:01:27;"Wait, is it called ""Home"" or ""Please Take Me Home""?"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"# Throwing it all away #"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"That's my favorite Phil Collins song."
01:01:31;01:01:32;"Really?"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Yeah."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Also, ""In Too Deep."""
01:01:34;01:01:35;"Also, ""Against All Odds."""
01:01:35;01:01:37;"""Against All Odds"" is the one."
01:01:37;01:01:40;"# I'm gonna just let you walk away"
01:01:40;01:01:44;"# Just let you leave without a trace"
01:01:44;01:01:50;"# When I stand here taking every breath with you"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"# Ooh"
01:01:52;01:01:58;"# You're the only one who really knew me at all"
01:01:58;01:02:05;"# How can you just walk away from me"
01:02:05;01:02:09;"# When all I can do is watch you leave"
01:02:09;01:02:13;"# 'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain"
01:02:13;01:02:17;"# And even shared the tears"
01:02:17;01:02:23;"# You're the only one who really knew me at all"
01:02:23;01:02:29;"# So take a look at me now"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"# There's just an empty space"
01:02:33;01:02:38;"# And there's nothing left here to remind me"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"# Just the memory of your face"
01:02:41;01:02:46;"# So take a look at me now"
01:02:46;01:02:50;"# There's just an empty space"
01:02:50;01:02:55;"# And you coming back to me is against the odds"
01:02:55;01:03:00;"# And that's what I've got to face. #"
01:03:00;01:03:06;"Time Crisis with Ezra Keenan."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"So this is your job, you're all at work right now,"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"you just sit around chatting."
01:03:10;01:03:12;"This is exceptional. I don't know if it's a job."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"Two hours every two weeks."
01:03:14;01:03:16;"That is a tough schedule you guys are on."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"It is. Gruelling. Wow. It's not easy."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"I would love to know what you're earning on an hourly rate."
01:03:21;01:03:23;"Is that right?"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"So you just sit and chat,"
01:03:25;01:03:28;"'cause normally in radio they say dead air is a crime."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"Oh, no, we'll let there be some dead air."
01:03:30;01:03:32;"How much can you let there be dead air?"
01:03:32;01:03:34;"Let's see how long before someone breaks."
01:03:37;01:03:42;"The ratings are actually going up."
01:03:42;01:03:45;"I just noticed. The listeners spiked."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Some peace and quiet."
01:03:47;01:03:49;"Word spread. Tune into Time Crisis."
01:03:49;01:03:51;"These guys are just chilling."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"Why did you call it Time Crisis?"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"Is it because of the computer game Time Crisis?"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Kind of. They told me I needed to come up with a name."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"I seriously was at Dave & Buster's"
01:04:00;01:04:02;"and I was watching somebody play Time Crisis"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"and I was like, ""This radio show we're going to talk about music from the past and history."""
01:04:05;01:04:07;"So Time Crisis. It made sense."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"Right. That was inspiration."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Do you ever feel like there is a crisis here?"
01:04:11;01:04:15;"On the show? Yeah."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"Once we had a Phish fan call in and Jake's a deadhead."
01:04:18;01:04:20;"So that was a bit of a crisis. Phishheads and deadheads."
01:04:20;01:04:22;"I don't know what that means."
01:04:22;01:04:24;"Oh yeah, English people have no idea what..."
01:04:24;01:04:26;"I don't know what that means. Do you know who Phish is?"
01:04:26;01:04:28;"Is this the PHISH? Yes."
01:04:28;01:04:30;"Well, I am aware of them."
01:04:30;01:04:32;"I would say I'm completely indifferent towards them."
01:04:32;01:04:34;"Oh. Okay, what about Grateful Dead?"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"Again, I'm as indifferent to them as I am lacrosse."
01:04:38;01:04:40;"You don't have a favorite Grateful Dead song?"
01:04:40;01:04:43;"No. You don't have a favorite professional lacrosse player?"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"No. Do you know any Grateful Dead songs?"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"No. You don't know Touch of Grey?"
01:04:48;01:04:51;"No. Can you name one member of the Grateful Dead?"
01:04:51;01:04:52;"No. No, come on."
01:04:52;01:04:54;"Yeah, you can. I genuinely can't."
01:04:54;01:04:55;"Really? Who is the..."
01:04:55;01:04:57;"I don't even know who the f*** the Grateful Dead are."
01:04:57;01:04:59;"I thought it was a horror movie."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"Come on. I'm from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire."
01:05:01;01:05:05;"Okay, that sounds pretty English."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"That is the most English sounding place."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"They did tour the UK in the early 70s."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"John Mayer?"
01:05:11;01:05:14;"Yes, John Mayer. He's kind of a member of the Grateful Dead."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"Okay, wait. Does the name Jerry Garcia mean anything to you?"
01:05:17;01:05:18;"Not really. Wow."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"Does the name Nic Lachey mean anything to you?"
01:05:21;01:05:22;"98 Degrees?"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"There it is! Yeah!"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"98 Degrees is your Grateful Dead."
01:05:26;01:05:27;"That's right. Wow."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"So, yeah. I mean, yeah, because it was big beef."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"You know, what if I said, uh..."
01:05:32;01:05:35;"What if I said to you, does..."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"You're saying, ""I don't know the Grateful Dead."""
01:05:37;01:05:39;"What if I said to you..."
01:05:39;01:05:42;"Joey Fatone."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Do you know which band he's from?"
01:05:44;01:05:45;"Oh, yeah, of course."
01:05:45;01:05:46;"In Sync?"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"That's right."
01:05:47;01:05:48;"God, you guys have got to be..."
01:05:48;01:05:49;"No, if you want to stump us with boy bands,"
01:05:49;01:05:52;"you're going to have to get into, like, the weird Buckinghamshire side of it."
01:05:52;01:05:54;"All right, what about Jason Orange?"
01:05:54;01:05:55;"Never heard of him."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"Jason Orange?"
01:05:56;01:05:58;"Yeah, no idea."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Is that a famous person?"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"Howard Donald?"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"Yeah."
01:06:02;01:06:03;"No, these are famous people?"
01:06:03;01:06:04;"Yeah."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"OK, Phil Lesh."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Gary Barlow."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"Oh, I have heard of Gary Barlow."
01:06:08;01:06:09;"Yes."
01:06:09;01:06:10;"Can't believe this is on the radio."
01:06:10;01:06:12;"We're literally just saying names."
01:06:12;01:06:14;"The ratings are spiking right now."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"We know Robbie Williams."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"Well, he was in Take That with Jason Orange and Howard Donald."
01:06:19;01:06:21;"Oh, I didn't know those were the other guys."
01:06:21;01:06:22;"Yeah."
01:06:22;01:06:23;"I have heard the name Gary Barlow."
01:06:23;01:06:24;"He's a wonderful songwriter."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"So there's Take That."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"Who are, like, the bad East--"
01:06:28;01:06:29;"East 17."
01:06:29;01:06:30;"I've heard of East 17."
01:06:30;01:06:31;"Huge band."
01:06:31;01:06:32;"I don't know them."
01:06:32;01:06:34;"I couldn't name a member, but I've heard of--they were the bad boys."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"That's right."
01:06:35;01:06:36;"They had a song called ""Deep."""
01:06:36;01:06:37;"That was, like, a big hit?"
01:06:37;01:06:41;"Yeah, we're going deep, baby, deep, deep down."
01:06:41;01:06:44;"Like a sweet sugar, it rests upon my chest."
01:06:44;01:06:46;"If you told me that was from your boy band--"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"It could have been."
01:06:47;01:06:48;"--and you wrote that at school, I'd believe that."
01:06:48;01:06:50;"I know one British boy band song."

01:06:54;01:06:55;"I want you back."

01:06:57;01:06:59;"Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"I just want you back for good."
01:07:01;01:07:02;"That's a beautiful song."
01:07:02;01:07:03;"I want you back."
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Yeah, because that one they played in America."
01:07:05;01:07:06;"I want you back for good."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Yeah, it was a huge tune."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Huge tune."
01:07:08;01:07:09;"So what else do you do on the show?"
01:07:09;01:07:10;"What else?"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"Is there anything else we should be doing?"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"Is there no--we take no texts or calls."
01:07:13;01:07:15;"We sometimes look at emails."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"You sometimes look at emails."
01:07:17;01:07:18;"Yeah."
01:07:18;01:07:19;"Just our own emails."
01:07:19;01:07:22;"Oh, you just check your own email while you're on the radio."
01:07:22;01:07:23;"Yeah, we got an email."
01:07:23;01:07:24;"What's this?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Okay, hang on."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"Is this an email that's come in?"
01:07:26;01:07:27;"Yeah."

01:09:27;01:09:31;"But I feel like you guys are missing out on one key important person of that era,"
01:09:31;01:09:34;"that person being American singer-songwriter Boz Skaggs."
01:09:34;01:09:38;"Boz Skaggs, the once former guitarist of the Steve Miller Band,"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"played a huge factor in '70s rock"
01:09:40;01:09:43;"and is a key influencer of today's music we hear."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"His critically acclaimed album Silk Degrees, 1976,"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"peaked at number two on the Billboard 200"
01:09:49;01:09:53;"and also had several solo top 20 hit singles in the United States."
01:09:53;01:09:57;"The main reason I'm writing this email is because I feel that Boz Skaggs"
01:09:57;01:10:01;"is extremely underrated for the work he has done for '70s rock and blues,"
01:10:01;01:10:05;"and that's why I personally feel he should be included in your Home Depot playlist."

01:10:22;01:10:26;"P.S., I know this email has a lot of grammatical errors, but it's from the heart."
01:10:26;01:10:30;"Also, Boz Skaggs was born in Ohio, which is a Wendy's connection."
01:10:30;01:10:34;"Plus, can we also see an eight-minute mansard roof at the VW show?"
01:10:34;01:10:38;"The song is only two minutes long, and it needs another verse or so, in my opinion."

01:12:24;01:12:27;"I guess for an English person, it's possible."
01:12:27;01:12:33;"He seemed like ride-or-die boy band stuff and like Queen, maybe like a theater kid."
01:12:33;01:12:36;"Oh, well, yeah, he comes from a musical theater."
01:12:36;01:12:37;"Okay, yeah, so that makes sense."
01:12:37;01:12:43;"He's like Queen and some sort of shaggy, kind of loose classic rock stuff."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"It's just not his aesthetic."
01:12:44;01:12:48;"Right. James Corden was starting boy bands, belting show tunes."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"He was into the woods and stuff, doing theater."
01:12:51;01:12:55;"Yeah, Queen is way more appealing and probably like some, maybe a couple of burnout kids."
01:12:55;01:12:56;"Also..."
01:12:56;01:12:58;"He's like a professional showbiz guy."
01:12:58;01:12:59;"Right."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"Like the Grateful Dead or not."
01:13:00;01:13:03;"He's a triple threat, too, by the way."
01:13:03;01:13:04;"Dancing? What?"
01:13:04;01:13:07;"Singing, dancing, acting, and hosting."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"Does he act and stuff?"
01:13:09;01:13:11;"He was in those Into the Woods movie."
01:13:11;01:13:13;"He's been like on Broadway and stuff."
01:13:13;01:13:22;"I guess it's very possible that like the dead really didn't tour the UK very much after the 70s."
01:13:22;01:13:25;"I don't know. Is that true? I mean, yeah, obviously '72."
01:13:25;01:13:26;"I mean, I feel like..."
01:13:26;01:13:27;"I don't know."
01:13:27;01:13:33;"Every American high school, at least through the 90s, would have had some kind of kid who like was into the dead."
01:13:33;01:13:34;"Right."
01:13:34;01:13:37;"Maybe not anymore, but you know, James is in his 30s, I think."
01:13:37;01:13:40;"So like if he was American, he'd at least know who Jerry Garcia was."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"Yeah."
01:13:41;01:13:44;"But it's possible you go to the average like 30-something English guy,"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"and you're just like, ""Name one member of the Grateful Dead,"" and they'll just be like..."
01:13:47;01:13:50;"Like you might as well be asking about Quicksilver Messenger Service."
01:13:50;01:13:51;"Right."
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Also clearly didn't know who Boz Skaggs was."
01:13:53;01:13:55;"Who's the drummer in Moby Grape?"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:13:57;01:13:58;"Yeah, we don't know that."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"No, I don't know."

01:17:48;01:17:50;"But also with music history,"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"if you grow up listening to, like, a certain radio station--"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"although even that's a played-out concept for kids today."
01:17:55;01:17:58;"If you just--if you grow up listening to your dad's"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"classic Rock Labor Day playlist"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"and you hear the same 20 songs over and over again,"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"for all you know, Boz Skaggs was an insignificant artist."
01:18:05;01:18:09;"You might not know that his album went to No. 2 on the Billboard charts"
01:18:09;01:18:14;"because maybe your dad favored Aerosmith because your dad's from Boston."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"So you're hearing Aerosmith, and you're just like,"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"""Well, Aerosmith is--I mean, they were a big band."""
01:18:19;01:18:21;"But I'm just saying, like, you have a very--"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"AC/DC, you know, yeah, Tom Petty, whatever."
01:18:23;01:18:24;"You're just like--"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Well, yeah, it's kind of--even, like, with--"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"I feel like until I started spending more time in L.A.,"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"I just really didn't know that many, like, Tupac songs."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"There's a lot of stuff they play on, like, on K-Day,"
01:18:33;01:18:35;"like the kind of throwback L.A. rap radio"
01:18:35;01:18:39;"that you just never--you didn't hear that much on Hot 97 in New York"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"because obviously New York--it skewed New York."
01:18:41;01:18:42;"Yeah."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"But anyway, some people describe Boss Gags as blue-eyed soul."
01:18:45;01:18:46;"Okay."
01:18:46;01:18:48;"I mean, I think of, like, Hall & Oates that way."
01:18:48;01:18:50;"Yeah, well, I guess blue-eyed soul is a big genre."
01:18:50;01:18:53;"It kind of refers to any white person trying to be soulful."
01:18:53;01:18:54;"Right."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"It is kind of--yeah, blue-eyed soul."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"There's something, like, a little sinister about it."
01:18:58;01:19:00;"Yeah, I wonder if they meant it that way"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"because, yeah, in, like, the context of today,"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"it seems a little bit like, ""Ew."""
01:19:04;01:19:07;"Well, blue-eyed makes you think of, like, Arian or something."
01:19:07;01:19:08;"Right."
01:19:08;01:19:11;"And obviously white people have all sorts of different eyes, eye colors."
01:19:11;01:19:12;"I have brown eyes."
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Yeah, I have hazel eyes."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"Just a brown-eyed handsome man."
01:19:16;01:19:20;"I guess blue eyes, even though you find that here and there,"
01:19:20;01:19:24;"to people that connotes Caucasian."
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Yeah."
01:19:25;01:19:27;"Yeah, you couldn't call it brown-eyed soul."
01:19:27;01:19:28;"Whatever."
01:19:28;01:19:29;"[laughs]"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"I don't know."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"Maybe this is not a politically correct phrase."
01:19:31;01:19:33;"I don't know if people still use it that much."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"Jonathan, your email is really going a long way on the show."
01:19:36;01:19:39;"Just a deep Boss Gags fan email."
01:19:39;01:19:41;"We're going to do the top five right now."
01:19:41;01:19:44;"And today, in tribute to Boss Gags"
01:19:44;01:19:48;"and the year that his album Silk Degrees peaked at number two on the Billboard 200,"
01:19:48;01:19:54;"we're going to compare the top five of 2017 with the top five of 1976."
01:19:54;01:19:55;"Silk Degrees."
01:19:55;01:19:57;"Our bicentennial year."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"America celebrating 200."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"We got Boss Gags hitting number two."
01:20:02;01:20:04;"Number two on the album charts, but let's see."
01:20:04;01:20:11;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:20:11;01:20:14;"We're going to start off with Boss Gags because his other big hit, Lowdown,"
01:20:14;01:20:18;"was number five on the Billboard charts."
01:20:18;01:20:21;"September '76, I Am In Utero."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"Really?"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Oh, yeah."
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Jake is just kind of taking it all in."
01:20:25;01:20:27;"Yep, I'm soaking it up."
01:20:27;01:20:29;"Just kind of getting ready to enter."
01:20:29;01:20:31;"Making my entrance February '77."
01:20:31;01:20:33;"Oh, this is Boss Gags?"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"This is a very funky song."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"Yeah."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"So, Jake, you're--"
01:20:36;01:20:37;"Heavily sampled."
01:20:37;01:20:39;"You're a fetus in your mother's womb."
01:20:39;01:20:45;"You're just kind of starting to, like, hear through the flesh what's going on in America,"
01:20:45;01:20:50;"and you're like, ""Man, I really like the tasteful palette of the music that's happening."
01:20:50;01:20:52;"I hope this lasts forever."""
01:20:52;01:20:54;"She's in, like, the frozen food aisle at the Grand Union."
01:20:54;01:20:57;"Yeah."
01:20:57;01:21:00;"You're just kind of like, ""Okay, man, I like this tasteful palette."
01:21:00;01:21:05;"This is what life is going to be like for the next, you know, hundred years."
01:21:05;01:21:06;"That's cool with me, man."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"I'll live a long, happy life."""
01:21:08;01:21:12;"Little did you know in four years, it'd be 1980, and the tasteful palette of the '70s"
01:21:12;01:21:17;"would be gone forever."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"Yeah, this is cool."
01:21:20;01:21:34;"Are those flutes?"
01:21:34;01:21:39;"I think so."
01:21:39;01:21:40;"Jeff Porcaro on drums."
01:21:40;01:21:41;"Legendary drummer."
01:21:41;01:21:44;"He played with Michael Jackson, Toto."
01:21:44;01:21:45;"Okay."
01:21:45;01:21:50;"That's a weird lateral move."
01:21:50;01:21:51;"He was in Toto."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"He and his brother founded Toto, the Porcaro bros."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Oh, okay."
01:21:54;01:21:56;"And then the Recession dudes for..."
01:21:56;01:22:00;"I think he was just known as, like, one of the best drummers in LA in the '70s and '80s."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"He's played on all sorts of stuff."
01:22:02;01:22:09;"The number five song in 2017, ""Portugal the Man."""
01:22:09;01:22:10;"Do you know this band, Jake?"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"No."
01:22:11;01:22:12;"I've read the cover."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"They're the talk of the music industry right now."
01:22:15;01:22:19;"This is the first time in a long time that, like, a ""alternative song"" has, like, broken"
01:22:19;01:22:20;"into top 40."
01:22:20;01:22:21;"Right."
01:22:21;01:22:24;"And, wait, sorry, what's the band called?"
01:22:24;01:22:29;"Portugal the Man."
01:22:29;01:22:32;"They're from where?"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"They're from Alaska."
01:22:33;01:22:34;"Wow."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"They're from the same town as Sarah Palin."
01:22:37;01:22:42;"Wow."
01:22:42;01:22:43;"How did they get their..."
01:22:43;01:22:44;"I mean..."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Can't you hear that lonesome Alaskan sound?"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"High, lonesome sound."
01:22:47;01:22:50;"They're kind of shooting themselves in the foot with that name, and they're coming out"
01:22:50;01:22:51;"of Alaska."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"That's, like, steep odds."
01:22:54;01:22:55;"Alaska the Man."
01:22:55;01:23:00;"Should've just named the band Alaska."
01:23:00;01:23:01;"Oh, wow."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"You know what's funny?"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"We were listening to this song the other day."
01:23:04;01:23:07;"And Rashida said this song sounds just like ""Please Mr. Postman."""
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Oh."
01:23:08;01:23:09;"Please Mr. Postman."
01:23:09;01:23:10;"Wait a minute, Mr. Postman."
01:23:10;01:23:11;"Yeah, yeah, wait a minute, Mr. Postman."
01:23:11;01:23:12;"And now I'm looking at the info about this song, and they credited the people who wrote"
01:23:12;01:23:13;"""Please Mr. Postman."""
01:23:13;01:23:14;"Really?"
01:23:14;01:23:15;"You think there's more of that happening now with the Internet and people being more litigious?"
01:23:15;01:23:16;"Yeah, people are scared of getting sued."
01:23:16;01:23:17;"And they're, like..."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"But this one..."
01:23:18;01:23:19;"They probably just wrote the song, and, like, ""Please Mr. Postman."""
01:23:19;01:23:20;"And then they're like, ""Please Mr. Postman."""
01:23:23;01:23:44;"And then someone later was like, ""Dude, that sounds like 'Please Mr. Postman.'"""
01:23:44;01:23:49;"This is a good song."
01:23:49;01:23:50;"Yeah."
01:23:50;01:23:53;"I caught this on 1260 AM the other day."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"You were just listening to this on AM radio?"
01:23:55;01:24:01;"Yeah, there's an oldie station I found in LA called 1260 AM, and it's all just 50s and"
01:24:01;01:24:02;"60s."
01:24:02;01:24:03;"Wow."
01:24:03;01:24:04;"And that's my go-to, like, car radio station."
01:24:04;01:24:05;"There must be some word today from my boyfriend who's on the phone."
01:24:05;01:24:06;"I've been feeling this is not easy, this is not."
01:24:06;01:24:16;"Oh, did they say that?"
01:24:16;01:24:17;"In his song?"
01:24:17;01:24:18;"1966?"
01:24:18;01:24:21;"Maybe they were very consciously shouting out, ""Please Mr. Postman."""
01:24:21;01:24:24;"The number four song in 1976."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"Remember, this is the height of disco."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Right."
01:24:28;01:24:29;", and the Sunshine Band, ""Shake, Shake, Shake."""
01:24:29;01:24:30;"You like disco, Jake?"
01:24:30;01:24:31;"Yeah, I'm down with it."
01:24:31;01:24:32;"I mean, it's got the tasteful palette of the 1970s."
01:24:32;01:24:33;"Yeah, I'm not throwing it on a lot, but I'm down with it."
01:24:33;01:24:34;"You're not one of those rock dudes who thinks disco sucks, are you?"
01:24:34;01:24:35;"No, that'd be amazing."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Just like in 2017 being like, ""I'm a Zeppelin guy, I can't stand disco."""
01:24:36;01:24:37;"Zeppelin, AC/DC, I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:24:37;01:24:38;"I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:24:45;01:25:06;"I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:25:06;01:25:13;"I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:25:13;01:25:18;"I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:25:23;01:25:24;"I'm a Zeppelin guy."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"That might have been the basis for this."
01:26:44;01:26:46;"I'm not suggesting a lawsuit."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"It's not close."
01:26:47;01:26:49;"Every song we're going to have to find the basis."
01:26:49;01:26:58;"He's kind of rapping."
01:26:58;01:27:03;"Imagination Dragons."
01:27:03;01:27:10;"The number three song in 1976 is another disco song."
01:27:10;01:27:11;"Wow."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"I think that 1976 is the year that Saturday Night Fever came out."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"You know, big year."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"So do you remember this one, A Fifth of Beethoven by Walter Murphy?"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"I don't know."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"Or are you familiar with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"Dun dun dun dun."
01:27:24;01:27:26;"Yeah, exactly."
01:27:26;01:27:28;"Nobody was trying to listen to that in 1976."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"So they did."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"Arguably you could call this a remix."
01:27:31;01:27:34;"Oh, I'm so bored."
01:27:34;01:27:37;"What is this classical bullsh*t?"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"It's 1976."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Saturday Night."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"We're at the club."
01:27:41;01:27:42;"Give me."
01:27:42;01:27:43;"Okay, what's that?"
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Whoa."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"Alright."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"I love this song."
01:27:46;01:27:49;"Did your parents have the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack?"
01:27:49;01:27:50;"No, no."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"They were checked out by then?"
01:27:51;01:27:52;"Yeah, yeah."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"They were checked out in '71."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"My dad had that, so I'd listen to that occasionally."
01:27:55;01:27:59;"See, this also brings to mind ELO."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"Yeah, the big strings."
01:28:01;01:28:03;"And also this."
01:28:03;01:28:10;"I feel like ELO would very consciously try to riff on classical music."
01:28:10;01:28:25;"Pretty cool that there's an instrumental song, number three on the charts."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"Wait, how long is this?"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"Three minutes, four seconds."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"Four seconds."
01:28:29;01:28:35;"Ooh."
01:28:35;01:28:39;"This part's tight."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"This is like Clav."
01:28:40;01:28:43;"Ooh, get in there."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"Oh, this is sick."
01:28:46;01:28:47;"Yeah, this is great."
01:28:47;01:28:55;"I'd be remiss not to point out, I'm sure some people at home remember,"
01:28:55;01:29:00;"Robin Thicke, before Blurred Lines, sampled this song."
01:29:00;01:29:05;"Oh no, is this Beethoven?"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"Oh no, this is so boring."
01:29:07;01:29:09;"Oh."
01:29:09;01:29:12;"Is this that song?"
01:29:12;01:29:20;"Improved by vocals?"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"What do you say?"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"I don't mind it."
01:29:24;01:29:30;"It's got that tasteful '70s palette."
01:29:30;01:29:35;"It's kind of funny."
01:29:35;01:29:46;"It's really awkward, but I like it."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"It's really awkward, but I like it."
01:29:49;01:30:07;"Robin's grandmother was like, ""I really like that one with the Beethoven."""
01:30:07;01:30:08;"Yeah."
01:30:08;01:30:12;"All right, not bad."
01:30:12;01:30:14;"I haven't thought about that song in a minute."
01:30:15;01:30:22;"The number three song on iTunes in 2017 is Cardi B, ""Bodak Yellow."""
01:30:22;01:30:23;"You know this one, Jake?"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"No."
01:30:24;01:30:28;"I should also point out, this song, I think, is about to go to number one on the charts."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"How do you know?"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"Because people have been talking about it."
01:30:31;01:30:36;"If this song goes to number one on the charts, it'll be the first time a female rapper"
01:30:36;01:30:39;"went to number one with no features since Lauryn Hill."
01:30:40;01:30:46;"So, 20 years passed without a female rapper having just a solo number one."
01:30:46;01:30:50;"So, no big other rapper coming in and doing a verse."
01:30:50;01:30:51;"Right, because who knows?"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"Maybe Nicki Minaj had a number, a single, but there was a feature or something."
01:30:54;01:30:55;"Right."
01:30:55;01:30:57;"So, this would be really big if this goes to number one on Billboard."
01:30:57;01:30:59;"What was the Lauryn Hill song 20 years ago?"
01:30:59;01:31:01;"I don't know, maybe Dua, that thing, probably went to number one."
01:31:01;01:31:06;"Do you know who Cardi B is?"
01:31:06;01:31:07;"No."
01:31:07;01:31:09;"She's from the Bronx."
01:31:09;01:31:12;"She became globally famous for being on a reality show."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"Really?"
01:31:13;01:31:14;"What one?"
01:31:14;01:31:16;"I think Love & Hip Hop."
01:31:16;01:31:23;"These bloody shoes."
01:31:23;01:31:27;"Haunting."

01:32:19;01:32:24;"so Christian Louboutin or how do people say Louboutin?"

01:32:27;01:32:28;"no"
01:32:28;01:32:30;"you never heard of Christian Louboutin?"
01:32:30;01:32:31;"no"
01:32:31;01:32:33;"what's like a fancy woman's shoe designer?"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"I'm like James Corden over here I don't know who Jerry Garcia is"
01:32:35;01:32:39;"wait you don't know any famous women's shoes designers?"
01:32:39;01:32:43;"have you ever heard of Jimmy?"
01:32:43;01:32:44;"I don't know"
01:32:44;01:32:46;"it's a fancy shoes Jimmy"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"give me a hint"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"last name starts with CH Jimmy"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"Chu?"
01:32:51;01:32:53;"yeah ok does that sound like a name to you?"
01:32:53;01:32:55;"no I've never heard of Jimmy Chu"
01:32:55;01:32:56;"really?"
01:32:56;01:33:02;"no I don't know I mean I don't follow fashion or women's shoes"
01:33:02;01:33:06;"do you know what Balenciaga is? does that sound like something?"
01:33:06;01:33:10;"Yves Saint Laurent?"
01:33:10;01:33:13;"it depends how French you want to be"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"Christian"
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Foden-Venzel"
01:33:15;01:33:19;"Christian De"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"Christian D"
01:33:21;01:33:22;"forget about the Christian"
01:33:22;01:33:23;"Dior"
01:33:23;01:33:24;"you've heard of Dior?"
01:33:24;01:33:34;"you know I read the New Yorker or whatever so I've seen fashion ads pass over my eyes for decades"
01:33:34;01:33:39;"the bottom of Christian Louboutin shoes are red and they're very expensive"
01:33:39;01:33:44;"ok so Christian Louboutin Michelle was just telling me it's patented"
01:33:44;01:33:48;"so you see red on the bottom of those shoes it's not going to be Jimmy Choo's"
01:33:48;01:33:51;"so now let's listen to the beginning of the song again"
01:33:51;01:33:56;"so like the concept of a red soled shoe or what is it exactly that they have the patent on?"
01:33:56;01:33:58;"I'd be curious what the actual language of the patent is"
01:33:58;01:34:02;"what if like Reebok was like here's a new basketball shoe"
01:34:02;01:34:06;"maybe it's something about a specific type of red sole on a woman's"
01:34:06;01:34:07;"fancy shoe"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"stiletto"
01:34:09;01:34:13;"if the shoe is retailing for more than $500 you cannot"
01:34:13;01:34:15;"or maybe it's a specific color"
01:34:15;01:34:18;"oh like a very specific shoe of red"
01:34:18;01:34:20;"yeah so now we have this new information so listen to this"
01:34:20;01:34:23;"so she's talking about expensive pair of shoes"
01:34:23;01:34:39;"so she's saying don't mess with me I'm wearing very expensive shoes"
01:34:39;01:34:42;"yeah but she's kind of turning it around too because she's not just saying"
01:34:42;01:34:44;"well it starts out"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"little b****"
01:34:46;01:34:48;"little b**** you don't f*** with me"
01:34:48;01:34:50;"you couldn't f*** with me if you wanted to"
01:34:50;01:34:52;"I paid $700 for these shoes"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"maybe more maybe she got even she's probably super rich now"
01:34:54;01:34:56;"I paid $950 for these shoes"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"I paid $1250 let's say $1250"
01:34:59;01:35:02;"I paid $1250 for these shoes so she's saying"
01:35:02;01:35:06;"so not only is she saying like I'm richer than you you can't you're not even at my level fashion wise"
01:35:06;01:35:08;"but I like that it's cool she says"
01:35:08;01:35:11;"rather than saying Christian Louboutin like that'd be so basic she says"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"these is red bottoms"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"these is bloody shoes"
01:35:15;01:35:17;"it is weirdly haunting"
01:35:17;01:35:21;"*singing*"
01:35:21;01:35:24;"Jake and Cardi B just run into each other"
01:35:24;01:35:27;"little b****"

01:43:04;01:43:06;"like that a Taylor Swift and Cardi B mixtape"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"or like a video like"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"an epic"

01:43:30;01:43:32;"you had the Wiz. You ever see that?"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"No"
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Oh the Wiz is crazy. Okay okay. It's"
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Michael Jackson, Diana Ross is Dorothy. Oh okay"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"Quincy Jones did the music"
01:43:40;01:43:42;"it's really cool. Gotcha. So we're about"
01:43:42;01:43:44;"to do for another"
01:43:44;01:43:46;"reimagining of it. Right. So I"
01:43:46;01:43:48;"think we should do like a pop music"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"one where"
01:43:50;01:43:52;"Cardi B is Dorothy"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"and she has red bottom"
01:43:54;01:43:56;"Louboutins or the slippers"
01:43:56;01:43:58;"Who's the Tin Man?"
01:43:58;01:44:00;"Like a good Tin Man from modern. Wait what's"
01:44:00;01:44:02;"the Tin Man? Oh Ed Sheeran can be"
01:44:02;01:44:04;"the lion. The lion. The caroling"
01:44:04;01:44:06;"lion maybe. Yeah yeah. The Tin Man doesn't"
01:44:06;01:44:08;"have a heart right? Tin Man doesn't have a heart"
01:44:08;01:44:10;"but he's kind of like a sweet guy"
01:44:10;01:44:12;"I don't know who could be the Tin Man"
01:44:12;01:44:14;"Shawn Mendes? I don't know"
01:44:14;01:44:16;"I'm just really... Or like"
01:44:16;01:44:18;"Tom York"
01:44:18;01:44:20;"Okay I was thinking a little more from the"
01:44:20;01:44:22;"pop sphere. Go broad. Yeah sure. Well he's like you know"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"No he loves to have a laugh about himself"
01:44:24;01:44:26;"he'd be down. Yeah he's perfect for that"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"Or maybe Bruno is in there somewhere. Oh Bruno"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"would be great. Yeah Bruno could be the"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"scarecrow. So you have Tom"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"York and Bruno. Oh"
01:44:40;01:44:42;"And Ed Sheeran as"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"the three. Yeah. Cardi B"
01:44:44;01:44:46;"is Dorothy. Taylor"
01:44:46;01:44:48;"is the Wicked Witch of the West."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Although we'll change the ending so that"
01:44:50;01:44:52;"it's a little more happily ever after."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Because the witch gets crushed by a house right?"
01:44:54;01:44:56;"No she gets melted by water or something."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"Oh yeah. No we'll make a happier ending"
01:44:58;01:45:00;"The end of our version will be that"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"actually Taylor and Cardi meet and"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"they become friends and they're like you know what there's enough"
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Louboutins for everybody. Right. We're both rich"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Yeah. What do we care?"
01:45:08;01:45:10;"And then the wizard"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"Zane Lowe is the wizard"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"Just like they hear the wizard they're like"
01:45:14;01:45:16;"why does the wizard have a New Zealand accent?"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"They pull up behind him just like Zane"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"dropping like sound effects"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"[Airhorn]"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"That's the Beats one"
01:45:24;01:45:26;"Wizard of Oz. Lot of potential"
01:45:26;01:45:28;"Number one song this week in"
01:45:28;01:45:30;"1976"
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Jake I know this is one of your favorite songs"
01:45:32;01:45:34;"As soon as you hear that opening riff"
01:45:34;01:45:36;"Oh yeah"
01:45:38;01:45:40;"Hey do it now"
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Brutal"
01:45:42;01:45:44;"Hey do it"
01:45:44;01:45:46;"You know we must have done 76 like"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"Yeah we've heard this song before"
01:45:48;01:45:50;"At some point like maybe a year ago"
01:45:52;01:45:54;"Playing in a rock and roll band"
01:45:54;01:45:56;"I never had no problems"
01:45:56;01:45:58;"Yeah"
01:45:58;01:46:00;"Burning down the one"
01:46:00;01:46:02;"That's been burning down"
01:46:02;01:46:04;"Burning down the one"
01:46:04;01:46:06;"That stands"
01:46:06;01:46:08;"And everything around me"
01:46:08;01:46:10;"This song was released"
01:46:10;01:46:12;"By the Cleveland based"
01:46:12;01:46:14;"Sweet City record label"
01:46:14;01:46:16;"That's cool. Came out of Cleveland based"
01:46:16;01:46:18;"I love that"
01:46:18;01:46:20;"Yes I did"
01:46:20;01:46:22;"To disco down and check out the show"
01:46:22;01:46:24;"Yeah they were"
01:46:24;01:46:26;"Dancing and singing"
01:46:26;01:46:28;"And moving to the moving"
01:46:28;01:46:30;"And just when"
01:46:30;01:46:32;"Rough stuff"
01:46:36;01:46:38;"Is this blue eyed soul"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Blue eyed funk"
01:46:42;01:46:44;"Or are they white"
01:46:44;01:46:46;"Uh"
01:46:46;01:46:48;"Yeah this is a"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Caucasian band. Okay"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"They're called wild what? Wild Cherry"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"Oh wow"
01:46:54;01:46:56;"I mean it's kind of funky. I do think there's"
01:46:56;01:46:58;"Something like. How did I not know that? Wild Cherry"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"One issue I always have with this song is like"
01:47:06;01:47:08;"And they were moving"
01:47:08;01:47:10;"Moving to the grooving"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"That just always seemed like a weak line to me"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"And they were dancing and dancing"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"And moving to the grooving"
01:47:16;01:47:18;"It's like grooving is moving"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"You don't move to the"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"I guess he's saying. You could say moving and grooving"
01:47:22;01:47:24;"You're moving to the grooving of the band"
01:47:24;01:47:26;"Uh it's"
01:47:26;01:47:28;"I don't like that line. Pretty thin"
01:47:28;01:47:30;"I mean"
01:47:30;01:47:32;"Play that funky music white boy"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"I also feel like this is. These guys are like a white"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"Funk band. They made this story up"
01:47:38;01:47:40;"A Cleveland based white funk band"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"Well actually you know we talk a lot of funk. Good great funk"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"Did come out of Ohio. Real"
01:47:44;01:47:46;"Ohio really is like a power player for like"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Funk and disco but"
01:47:48;01:47:50;"I wonder if the guys in Wild Cherry"
01:47:50;01:47:52;"Actually were kind of part of like"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"The larger funk scene. These guys are all white"
01:47:54;01:47:56;"Were they collaborating with black artists"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"Or is this literally just a fantasy"
01:47:58;01:48:00;"That a bunch of white funk guys"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"Imagine like. What's your dream Wild Cherry"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"I guess my dream would be that"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"One day we're just like killing it so hard"
01:48:06;01:48:08;"That some non-white people"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Come to the club and just see how funky we are"
01:48:10;01:48:12;"And just say wow. These are some funky white boys"
01:48:12;01:48:14;"Play that funky music white boy. It's like"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"Did this happen? This is just a fantasy"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Imagine if like Macklemore"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"Dropped a song about like that he was like"
01:48:20;01:48:22;"Rapping at the club. Oh my god"
01:48:22;01:48:24;"And then like Kendrick came in and said"
01:48:24;01:48:26;"You're really good at rapping"
01:48:26;01:48:28;"White boy. And he's just like telling the whole story"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"And you're like can I get a fact check on that"
01:48:30;01:48:32;"Did that happen"
01:48:32;01:48:34;"Well anyway"
01:48:34;01:48:36;"Dropping sick verse white boy"
01:48:36;01:48:38;"You're really good at rapping"
01:48:38;01:48:40;"White boy"
01:48:40;01:48:42;"Number one song. Kind of like 8 Mile"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"Yeah that's true"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"Eminem"
01:48:46;01:48:48;"Let's give Wild Cherry the benefit of the doubt. They were in on the scene"
01:48:48;01:48:50;"Somebody"
01:48:50;01:48:52;"Yeah maybe somebody said that"
01:48:52;01:48:54;"It's possible"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"Anyway that was the number one song this week"
01:48:56;01:48:58;"In 1976. The number one song on"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"iTunes this week"
01:49:00;01:49:02;"Post Malone"
01:49:02;01:49:04;"Do you remember who Post Malone is"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"I don't. Despot was the first person"
01:49:06;01:49:08;"Who ever told me about Post Malone like years ago"
01:49:08;01:49:10;"He's had a bunch of big hits the past couple"
01:49:10;01:49:12;"Years. Interesting guy from Texas. I mean I've heard the name"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"So he just put out a new song featuring"
01:49:14;01:49:16;"21 Savage called Rockstar"
01:49:16;01:49:18;"Who's 21 Savage"
01:49:18;01:49:20;"He's like a huge rapper right now"
01:49:20;01:49:22;"I got one two"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"Two in my bank account"
01:49:24;01:49:26;"Dating"
01:49:26;01:49:28;"Amber Rose"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"You don't know who Amber Rose is? Nope"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Come on. Who is that? Is it an actress?"
01:49:32;01:49:34;"Uh"
01:49:34;01:49:36;"You don't even know. She's probably"
01:49:36;01:49:38;"I just don't want to discredit her as an actress"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"Because maybe she has acted. She's originally known as a"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"Model. An activist"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"Oh. Right wing"
01:49:44;01:49:46;"A right wing activist. No she's"
01:49:46;01:49:48;"Like her main issue is about like"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"Stopping like slut shaming"
01:49:50;01:49:52;"And like she organized a thing called"
01:49:52;01:49:54;"Slut Walk. Okay. That's kind of"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Basically just about like you know women can wear whatever they want"
01:49:56;01:49:58;"Without being harassed. Very cool"
01:49:58;01:50:00;"So this is Post Malone featuring 21 Savage"
01:50:00;01:50:02;"Rockstar. Savage is tough because I just"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"I can't help but think about Savage Garden"
01:50:04;01:50:08;"I think. Like is that not. Maybe that's unfair"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"Of me. Most 21 Savage fans do not"
01:50:10;01:50:12;"Have that problem"
01:50:12;01:50:14;"Imagine we had 21 Savage on the show and Jake is like"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"So when you came up"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"With that name clearly Savage Garden means"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"Very large for you. How'd you deal with that?"
01:50:20;01:50:22;"How'd you get past that?"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"Was it hard when you first came on the scene"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"People would hear Savage and they're thinking"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"Savage Garden"
01:50:28;01:50:38;"Wait so Post Malone. Is that a reference to"
01:50:38;01:50:40;"Karl Malone? Yes"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"Because he was the post man or whatever. Is that what his nickname was?"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"No well I guess it's"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"Kind of deeper but it's"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"Post Malone's real name is"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"Austin Richard Post"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"Okay"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"Well he's clearly a"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Basketball fan"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"Because uh"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"His first song was called White Iverson"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"Remember that? Oh yeah"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"This is cool"
01:51:12;01:51:28;"This song's called"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"Rockstar. No guitar"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"Guess Eric Clapton's right. Although"
01:51:32;01:51:34;"Post Malone does play guitar. He's done some songs"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"Where he plays acoustic"
01:51:36;01:51:38;"Rockstar"
01:51:56;01:52:03;"Drank and hit it bad, Jumpin' in the pool and I ain't got on no bra,"
01:52:03;01:52:07;"Hit her front or back, Pullin' on her tracks and now she screamin' out no more,"
01:52:07;01:52:13;"They like savage why you got a twelve car garage and you only got six cars,"
01:52:13;01:52:19;"I ain't with the cake and how you kiss that, Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snap,"
01:52:19;01:52:25;"Green hundreds in my safe, I got whole racks, L.A., it's always askin' where the f*** at,"
01:52:25;01:52:28;"Livin' like a rockstar, Smash out on a cop car,"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, You know you are not hard,"
01:52:31;01:52:34;"I done made the hat chart, Memo used to chop hard,"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar,"
01:52:37;01:52:43;"I've been poppin', poppin', man I feel just like a rockstar,"
01:52:43;01:52:49;"All my brothers got that gas and they always be smokin' like a rockstar,"
01:52:49;01:52:55;"When we call up on the f*** and show up in them the shots,"
01:52:55;01:53:01;"When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta,"
01:53:01;01:53:12;"Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar,"
01:53:12;01:53:22;"Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar,"
01:53:22;01:53:42;"Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar,"
01:53:42;01:53:52;"Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar,"
