02:35;02:43;"With my pencil turning moments into light"
02:43;02:52;"High above In the violet sky"
02:52;03:00;"A silent silver play It draws a golden chain"
03:00;03:08;"One by one All the stars appear"

03:16;03:25;"Spinning away Like the night sky at us"

05:23;05:31;"It must stop, it must stop"
05:31;05:39;"I draw one of the lines to drown"
05:39;05:48;"It must stop, it must stop"
05:48;05:56;"To live as the great beast lays"
05:56;06:04;"It must stop, it must stop"
06:04;06:09;"I draw one of the lines to drown"
06:09;06:13;"But by drawing me"
06:13;06:21;"It must stop, it must stop"
06:21;06:30;"And now, as the earth's sun dies"

09:44;09:57;"I always flirt with death"
09:57;10:01;"I look ill but I don't care about it"
10:01;10:04;"I can't face your threats and stand up straight"
10:04;10:07;"And talk and shout about it"
10:07;10:11;"I think I'm on another world with you"
10:11;10:13;"With you"
10:13;10:17;"I'm on another planet with you"
10:17;10:19;"With you"
10:19;10:22;"You get under my skin"
10:22;10:25;"I don't find it irritating"
10:25;10:28;"You always play to win"
10:28;10:31;"But I won't need rehabilitate"
10:31;10:32;"No, no"
10:32;10:36;"I think I'm on another world with you"
10:36;10:38;"With you"
10:38;10:42;"I'm on another planet with you"
10:42;10:44;"With you"
10:44;10:47;"Another girl, another planet"
10:47;10:51;"Another girl, another planet with you"
10:51;10:54;"(guitar solo)"
11:25;11:28;"Space travels in my blood"
11:28;11:31;"There ain't nothing I can do about it"
11:31;11:34;"Long journeys wear me out but"
11:34;11:37;"I know I can't live without it"
11:37;11:42;"I know I think I'm on another world with you"
11:42;11:44;"With you"
11:44;11:48;"I'm on another planet with you"
11:48;11:50;"With you"
11:50;11:56;"Another girl who's loving you now"
11:56;12:01;"Another planet who's holding you down"
12:01;12:03;"Another planet"
12:03;12:07;"Also, while you were home, dad emailed me an mp3."
12:07;12:09;"Which I think is a first."
12:09;12:10;"I helped him."
12:10;12:11;"Oh, okay."
12:11;12:12;"Yeah."
12:12;12:14;"So he sent me this mp3 that's called ""Ezzy and Emmy"""
12:14;12:16;"My parents used to call me Ezzy."
12:16;12:18;"Fall '89."
12:18;12:22;"And thought maybe we'd listen to a little bit of it since we're both here."
12:22;12:23;"Okay."
12:23;12:25;"I think this is ripped from a cassette."
12:25;12:27;"Yes, I think it was a cassette."
12:27;12:31;"Hello, this is my show with Emma and my mom."
12:31;12:34;"Today I had a good day at school."
12:34;12:35;"Mommy!"
12:35;12:39;"I played with my friends Dana and Gregory."
12:39;12:43;"We played with toy cars and then was--"
12:43;12:46;"Okay, so right off the bat, I have a lot of questions."
12:46;12:48;"One thing I've been thinking about--"
12:48;12:50;"Lately I've been thinking about accents a lot."
12:50;12:52;"I can't tell if I just have a baby voice"
12:52;12:57;"or if I used to have more of a New York, joy-zy accent."
12:57;12:59;"Because I say, ""We play with toy cars."""
12:59;13:01;"Or do all kids speak that way?"
13:01;13:06;"I think all kids have a particular dialect that is unique to children."
13:06;13:10;"Which is-- I feel like all kids kind of sound like Jersey to me."
13:10;13:12;"I mean, we grew up in New Jersey, so I'm biased."
13:12;13:14;"Maybe we have no idea because we grew up in New Jersey."
13:14;13:15;"Yeah."
13:15;13:18;"If you hear a kid say, ""I played with a toy,"""
13:18;13:19;"what does that sound like to you?"
13:19;13:21;"Because, Ethan, you grew up in the South."
13:21;13:25;"In the South we would say, ""I played with a toy."""
13:25;13:26;"Really?"
13:26;13:27;"Yeah, I just got a new toy."
13:27;13:30;"Did you have more of a Southern accent when you were a child?"
13:30;13:34;"No, because my parents were both from the Northeast."
13:34;13:37;"So I was surrounded by very Southern-sounding children"
13:37;13:38;"that would say ""toy."""
13:38;13:40;"But I said, ""Toy."""
13:40;13:41;"Toy."
13:42;13:44;"I think you just emulate your parents, right?"
13:44;13:46;"And then you put a little kid sauce on it."
13:46;13:47;"Right."
13:47;13:48;"Well, that's something funny because I was playing this--"
13:48;13:50;"Let me see if there's a part where Mom talks."
13:50;13:51;"Mom's very soft-spoken."
13:51;13:52;"Yeah."
13:52;13:56;"She was so gentle in the videos that we watched."
13:56;13:58;"Say, ""Ezzie."""
13:58;13:59;"Ezzie."
14:00;14:01;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:01;14:03;"Take your fingers and say, ""Emmy."""
14:03;14:06;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:06;14:08;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:08;14:10;"Come on, it's your turn."
14:10;14:11;"Say, ""Hi."""
14:11;14:12;"Hi, Uncle Wade."
14:12;14:15;"Let's stop it."
14:15;14:18;"Uh-oh."
14:18;14:20;"Say, ""Emmy."""
14:20;14:23;"Mom, come on, it's your turn."
14:23;14:24;"Hi, Emmy."
14:24;14:27;"Twinkle, twinkle."
14:27;14:30;"The thing is that my mom is like--"
14:30;14:35;"people, when my friends do impressions of her--"
14:35;14:37;"not that they're doing stand-up routines,"
14:37;14:39;"but when they're just kind of saying, ""Oh, your mom said something,"""
14:39;14:43;"they do this impression of Mom that to me sounds like coffee talk."
14:43;14:44;"Exactly."
14:44;14:46;"Well, whenever I've imitated Mom telling a story"
14:46;14:50;"and I'm doing some kind of extreme New York-y, New Jewish--"
14:50;14:51;"New Jewish?"
14:51;14:52;"New Jewish."
14:52;14:53;"Freudian slip."
14:53;14:55;"New York-y, old Jewish."
14:55;14:58;"New Jersey-ian voice, really over the top."
14:58;15:00;"And then my mom's like, ""Emma, why did you do that?"""
15:00;15:03;"And people are like, ""Your mom sounds exactly like that."""
15:03;15:04;"No, but she doesn't sound like that."
15:04;15:05;"Of course not."
15:05;15:07;"But you think--now I hear it more."
15:07;15:08;"She does have a slight accent."
15:08;15:09;"It's subtle."
15:09;15:10;"Dad has more of an accent."
15:10;15:13;"Is he you playing with a--I don't know."
15:13;15:15;"They don't sound like super New York to me."
15:15;15:16;"That is more--"
15:16;15:17;"That's New Jewish."
15:17;15:19;"That's a New Jewish accent."
15:19;15:20;"New Jewish."
15:20;15:24;"Well, I feel like the thing that distinguishes Dad's dialect"
15:24;15:29;"is the lack of H's whenever he'll be like, ""It was a human being."""
15:29;15:30;"Huge."
15:30;15:34;"Oh, yes, he's like--Dad is like Donald Trump because he says ""yuge."""
15:34;15:36;"It was yuge."
15:36;15:39;"And you know one weird thing is this is so random it doesn't come up often."
15:39;15:42;"Dad says ""gymnast."""
15:42;15:44;"Well, wait, Mom says all these weird words."
15:44;15:48;"She says ""anorectic"" for anorexic and ""trauma."""
15:48;15:49;"Trauma?"
15:49;15:51;"Yeah, for trauma."
15:51;15:54;"She has this very German pronunciation of certain words."
15:54;15:56;"Oh, trauma. Maybe it's because she's a psychotherapist."
16:09;16:12;"Oh, what a night"
16:12;16:17;"Late December back in '63"
16:17;16:21;"What a very special time for me"
16:21;16:27;"As I remember what a night"
16:27;16:30;"Oh, what a night"
16:30;16:35;"You know I didn't even know her name"
16:35;16:39;"But I was never gonna be the same"
16:39;16:46;"What a lady, what a night"
16:46;16:49;"Oh, I"
16:49;16:53;"I'd have thought it even when she was"
16:53;16:58;"Oh, what a night"
16:58;17:04;"'Cause I would call it ended much too soon"
17:04;17:07;"Oh, what a night"
17:07;17:12;"Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me"
17:12;17:16;"She was everything I dreamed she'd be"
17:16;17:20;"Sweet surrender, what a night"
17:33;17:37;"I felt a rush like a rolling ball of thunder"
17:37;17:41;"Screaming my head around and digging my body under"
17:41;17:43;"Oh, what a night"
18:00;18:02;"Oh, I"
18:02;18:06;"I'd have thought it even when she was"
18:06;18:11;"Oh, what a night"
18:11;18:17;"'Cause I would call it ended much too soon"
18:17;18:20;"Oh, what a night"
18:20;18:25;"Why'd it take so long to see the light"
18:25;18:30;"Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right"
18:30;18:34;"What a lady, what a night"
18:45;18:51;"Oh, I felt a rush like a rolling ball of thunder"
18:51;18:55;"Screaming my head around and digging my body under"
18:55;18:56;"Oh, what a night"
19:14;19:18;"That was Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons with Oh, What a Night."
19:18;19:23;"We were playing that one in honor of Jake because that was his prom theme song."
19:23;19:26;"Right. Was that like mid-70s Frankie Valli?"
19:26;19:31;"Yeah, that was kind of like their comeback in mid-70s, like '74, '75."
19:31;19:35;"It's the same album as ""Who Loves You Pretty Baby?"""
19:35;19:36;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
19:36;19:39;"So they were kind of going for the more like Euro, disco-y type thing."
19:39;19:41;"Four Seasons or is that Frankie Valli solo?"
19:41;19:42;"It's Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons."
19:42;19:43;"Oh, wow."
19:43;19:44;"All together."
19:44;19:48;"And so, I mean, you're very familiar with them because you used to work at Jersey Boys in New York."
19:48;19:50;"Yes, I was an usher for Jersey Boys."
19:50;19:52;"Which is a musical."
19:52;19:53;"Which is a musical on Broadway."
19:53;19:57;"I worked at a lot of different Broadway shows, but I worked there the most."
19:57;19:59;"So I probably saw it about 80 times."
19:59;20:00;"Do you love it?"
20:00;20:02;"I do love it."
20:02;20:05;"Do you think you could, like, write the whole play from memory?"
20:05;20:10;"At the time I could have because at a certain point I became so bored having seen it so many times"
20:10;20:14;"that I would just memorize, like, the lighting keys and stuff."
20:14;20:17;"Is an usher in the theater the whole time?"
20:17;20:23;"Yeah, you hand out the programs and then you're there to essentially guard against all the rules,"
20:23;20:27;"you know, if people are on their phones or taking pictures or talking."
20:27;20:30;"So you stop people from trying to plug in their phones on stage."
20:30;20:31;"Yes."
20:31;20:34;"Did anybody ever die at Jersey Boys?"
20:34;20:36;"What?"
20:36;20:37;"Well, hold on."
20:37;20:39;"In this story, yes."
20:39;20:44;"No, I think there was one performance where someone had some kind of medical emergency"
20:44;20:46;"and they had to stop the show."
20:46;20:49;"That's what I was thinking of because I don't see Broadway plays that often."
20:49;20:56;"But my friend took me to see The Elephant Man, which was a big hit on Broadway last year"
20:56;21:00;"with Bradley Cooper, the American sniper himself."
21:00;21:07;"And kind of towards the end of the play, Elephant Man is about to die."
21:07;21:10;"He basically goes to get in his bed to die."
21:10;21:14;"And also the whole time Bradley Cooper, he's not wearing any prosthetics or anything,"
21:14;21:21;"but he kind of just twists his body and makes a lot of noises and goes, ""Thank you, sir."""
21:21;21:23;"Literally for the whole play, that's Bradley Cooper's voice."
21:23;21:25;"He's English?"
21:25;21:28;"Yeah. The real elephant man was English."
21:28;21:32;"And so Bradley Cooper is doing this hunchback, and he's walking over to his bed to die."
21:32;21:35;"And he's going, ""Ahh."""
21:35;21:39;"And then you start to hear this other noise, like, ""Ahh."""
21:39;21:42;"And it's like, ""Is that coming from the stage?"""
21:42;21:46;"It was literally this moment, this really tense moment of him going across the stage."
21:46;21:48;"And then, ""Ahh, ahh."""
21:48;21:52;"And he's getting closer to the bed, and I'm kind of looking around like,"
21:52;21:54;"""What is this, some weird surround sound thing?"""
21:54;21:58;"And then suddenly a woman stands up and is like, ""Oh, my God, baby, no!"""
21:58;22:00;"This woman's horrified. She's weeping."
22:00;22:05;"And then you literally have a full house of like 400 or 500 people just sitting in seats,"
22:05;22:08;"full brightness, while this is going on."
22:08;22:10;"And she's like, ""Is there a doctor? Is there a doctor?"""
22:10;22:12;"And then a doctor runs over, and everybody just sits there."
22:12;22:17;"Bradley Cooper's just sitting on stage on the bed, did not break character,"
22:17;22:21;"but also didn't turn around or do any--I mean, I don't know what you do in that scenario."
22:21;22:27;"And then some stagehand very subtly brought a scrim down on the front of the scene,"
22:27;22:29;"but you could still see the actors frozen up there."
22:29;22:35;"And then 40 minutes later, they get the guy on a stretcher, they take him out."
22:35;22:37;"It seemed like he was okay."
22:37;22:42;"Oh, and then also the head usher or whatever kept coming over the intercom and just be like,"
22:42;22:45;"""An ambulance has been called."""
22:45;22:48;"And just everybody's sitting there, and it's so weird and uncomfortable."
22:48;22:51;"It seemed like by the time the guy got on the stretcher that he was in good shape"
22:51;22:55;"and was going to survive, and then literally 30, 40 minutes later,"
22:55;22:58;"bring it down and do the last four minutes of the play."
22:58;22:59;"[laughter]"
22:59;23:01;"Then Bradley Cooper dies on stage."
23:01;23:02;"Wow."
23:02;23:03;"And that was that."
23:03;23:06;"Anyway, I'm glad that that guy seemed to be okay."
23:06;23:09;"And respect to Bradley Cooper for being one of our finest actors."
23:09;23:10;"So here is--"
23:10;23:12;"I heard he killed that night."
23:12;23:15;"[laughter]"
23:15;23:21;"And now in honor of the gentleman who survived a near-death experience at the theater"
23:21;23:23;"and to Bradley Cooper for being one of our finest actors,"
23:23;23:26;"here's Tame Impala with their song ""Elephant."""
23:55;24:00;"Mr. Shut the gate, shout when they ask who is on top"
24:00;24:08;"And one day I'll be down, I'll be down there"
24:08;24:17;"Please not to be that scared"
24:17;24:20;"You got friends but they got the fear"
24:20;24:24;"But I don't care, I don't want you if you just disappear"
24:24;24:29;"But one day there is no coming down the stairs"
24:58;25:00;"[applause]"
25:29;25:30;"[applause]"
26:10;26:13;"[applause]"
26:42;27:11;"The first time I saw you Standing at the water"
27:11;27:18;"You must have been all out a thousand feet tall"
27:18;27:26;"Nearly naked and ashamed I had her out to do"
27:26;27:32;"Your love was so big it made New York live smoke"
27:32;27:41;"You've been the subject of so many claims Since I climbed your torso"
27:41;27:55;"Oh, my statue of liberty And pale-haired hair, what do you do to me?"
27:55;28:09;"I leaned right over to kiss your stony bow A little jealous of the ships with whom you flirt"
28:09;28:23;"A billion lovers with their cameras stopped below And in my fantasy you're sailed beneath your skirt"
28:23;28:30;"You've been the subject of so many dreams Since I climbed your torso"
28:30;28:43;"Oh, my statue of liberty And pale-haired hair, what do you do to me?"
28:43;28:57;"Say it! Pop it!"
28:57;29:10;"Oh, my statue of liberty And pale-haired hair, what do you do to me?"
29:10;29:28;"Say it! Oh, my statue of liberty And pale-haired hair, what do you do to me?"
29:28;29:39;"Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!"
29:39;29:46;"So pretty soon, Jake, our resident rock expert, is gonna walk us through one of his favorite albums of all time,"
29:46;29:50;"Alien Lanes by Guided By Voices. Yep. Emma, have you ever heard of Guided By Voices?"
29:50;29:56;"I've heard of them. What do you, do you know anything about them? What do you think they sound like?"
29:56;30:03;"Uh, I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm the... No, no, you're the right person. Oh, because I'm such a novice?"
30:03;30:07;"No, you're not a novice, you're just the youngest person in the room. Okay. Guided By Voices..."
30:07;30:11;"Aside from my little cousin in the corner. Hey!"
30:11;30:17;"But, so you're, you're the youngest person in the room. Do you know Guided By Voices? Do you care about rock music?"
30:17;30:25;"I care, uh, on a macro level about rock music. Um... What does that mean?"
30:25;30:32;"Well, I just, I don't know a lot of the minutiae, I don't know a lot of the data about music, but I think it's important."
30:32;30:39;"When people ask you, like, what kind of music do you like, what do you say? I usually pass out. Everything but country?"
30:39;30:46;"Jersey Boys? Musicals? I usually just say, like, Liz Phair and Elvis Costello."
30:46;30:51;"And you've been saying that for, for like, ten to fifteen years? For fifteen years."
30:51;30:59;"So what's like a typical thing that you would listen to? Um, just friends of mine making music. That's my go-to."
30:59;31:04;"Is friends? Yeah. That's, I feel the most connected to that."
31:04;31:09;"When it's your friends who, who made the music? Yes. Like, my friends who are musicians."
31:09;31:15;"I totally hear you on that. Yeah. Yeah, friend rock. Friend rock. Yeah. Friend rock. That's my genre."
31:15;31:23;"Friend rock's a great genre. It's always, you can always go to the show, give 'em support. Doesn't have to be great, just has to be friend, about friends."
31:23;31:28;"Yeah, but are you really gonna be listening to it when you're, you know, driving, driving around or something?"
31:28;31:36;"Definitely. Yeah? Okay. I like, well, I'm very, uh, I'm not very technologically savvy, so I still listen to CDs in my car."
31:36;31:42;"And I've made, like, mixed CDs that are just my friends' songs for myself. Okay, that's nice."
31:42;31:49;"You gotta support. Well, I know you gotta go, but tune in later if you care at all about what Codified Voices sounds like."
31:49;31:54;"You might like it. You might like it. I'm very intrigued now. You've whet my appetite."
31:54;32:00;"So please, please check that out. In the meantime, we're gonna listen to some mellow but sad Sunday music."
32:00;32:03;"Here's Peter, Paul, and Mary with Puff the Magic Dragon."
32:14;32:27;"Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
32:27;32:39;"Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff"
32:39;32:53;"Oh, Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
32:53;33:06;"Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
33:06;33:13;"Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail"
33:13;33:20;"Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail"
33:20;33:26;"Noble kings and princes would bow whenever they came"
33:26;33:32;"Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name"
33:32;33:46;"Oh, Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
33:46;33:59;"Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
33:59;34:06;"A dragon lives forever but not so little boys"
34:06;34:13;"Painted wings and giant's rings make way for other toys"
34:13;34:19;"One grey night it happened Jackie Paper came no more"
34:19;34:26;"And Puff the Mighty Dragon he ceased his fearless run"
34:26;34:33;"His head was bent in sorrow green scales fell like rain"
34:33;34:39;"Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane"
34:39;34:46;"Without his lifelong friend Puff could not be brave"
34:46;34:52;"So Puff the Mighty Dragon sadly slipped into his cave"
34:52;35:06;"Oh, Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
35:06;35:22;"Puff the Magic Dragon lived by the sea And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Hunalee"
35:22;35:31;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beats 1"
35:31;35:34;"That was Peter, Paul and Mary with Puff the Magic Dragon."
35:34;35:40;"I don't know, that just feels like a good, kinda sad Sunday song to play on Time Crisis."
35:40;35:42;"How does that song make you guys feel?"
35:42;35:44;"It does remind me of my youth."
35:44;35:48;"There was a cartoon, right? Puff the Magic Dragon?"
35:48;35:49;"Yeah, yeah, I think there was."
35:49;35:54;"And I can see it, I can't really remember it, but I can see it."
35:54;35:58;"It was some sort of animation with a dragon."
35:58;36:06;"The thing I always think about with that song is like, why is there so much stuff for children that's about childhood ending?"
36:06;36:11;"There's like Puff the Magic Dragon, then there's the Giving Tree. Do you remember that book, Shel Silverstein?"
36:11;36:12;"Oh, sure."
36:12;36:24;"That's basically the same thing. It's about a tree that this boy, it's in the boy's life the whole time and the tree gives him apples and a place to hang out and a place to play."
36:24;36:31;"And then the boy grows up and literally murders the thing that provided him joy."
36:31;36:35;"It's just a metaphor for any childhood."
36:35;36:41;"Resource exploitation, job creator. It's brutal."
36:41;36:47;"It's brutal, but also, so these are for kids. It's basically, it's not like these are books for an adult."
36:47;36:50;"That's like, how do you process the passing of time?"
36:50;36:54;"This is literally for children that's saying, like, buckle up."
36:54;37:02;"Like all this that's meaningful to you now, you're going to murder it and you're going to hate it and you're going to make it really sad."
37:02;37:03;"Dreams die."
37:04;37:08;"Your imagination will crumble and become brittle."
37:08;37:11;"But is that important? I guess like that's important for children to learn."
37:11;37:16;"There's one other song that I feel it kind of exists in this category."
37:16;37:20;"That's also got that kind of melancholy growing up vibe."
37:20;37:22;"This is the only one other one that I can think of that was a hit song."
37:22;37:23;"Okay."
37:23;37:25;"This is Harry Chapin, Cats in the Cradle."
37:25;37:26;"Brutal."
37:26;37:27;"Terrible."
37:39;37:42;"My child arrived just the other day."
37:42;37:45;"He came to the world in the usual way."
37:45;37:49;"But there were planes to catch and bills to pay."
37:49;37:51;"He learned to walk while I was away."
37:51;37:53;"And he was talking for I knew it."
37:53;37:58;"And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you, Dad."
37:58;38:02;"You know I'm going to be like you."
38:02;38:06;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon."
38:06;38:09;"Little boy, little man on the phone."
38:09;38:12;"When you're coming home, Dad, I don't know when."
38:12;38:15;"But we'll get together then."
38:15;38:18;"You know we'll have a good time then."
38:27;38:30;"My son turned ten just the other day."
38:30;38:32;"He said, thanks for the ball, Dad."
38:32;38:33;"Come on, let's play."
38:33;38:35;"Can you teach me to throw?"
38:35;38:36;"I said, not today."
38:36;38:38;"I got a lot to do."
38:38;38:40;"He said, that's okay."
38:40;38:42;"And then he walked away, but his smile never dimmed."
38:42;38:45;"He said, I'm going to be like him."
38:45;38:50;"Yeah, you know I'm going to be like him."
38:50;38:53;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon."
38:53;38:56;"Little boy, little man on the phone."
38:56;38:59;"When you're coming home, Dad, I don't know when."
38:59;39:02;"But we'll get together then."
39:02;39:05;"You know we'll have a good time then."
39:14;39:17;"Well, he came from college just the other day."
39:17;39:20;"So much like a man, I just had to say."
39:20;39:21;"Son, I'm proud of you."
39:21;39:23;"Can you sit for a while?"
39:23;39:26;"He shook his head and he said with a smile."
39:26;39:30;"What I'd really like, Dad, is the bar or the car keys."
39:30;39:34;"See you later, can I have them please?"
39:34;39:37;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon."
39:37;39:40;"Little boy, blue, and the man on the phone."
39:40;39:43;"When you're coming home, Son, I don't know when."
39:43;39:46;"But we'll get together then."
39:46;39:49;"You know we'll have a good time then."
39:58;40:00;"I've long since retired."
40:00;40:02;"My son's moved away."
40:02;40:05;"I called him up just the other day."
40:05;40:08;"I said I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
40:08;40:13;"He said I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time."
40:13;40:16;"You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu."
40:16;40:19;"But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad."
40:19;40:23;"It's been sure nice talking to you."
40:23;40:27;"And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me."
40:27;40:30;"He'd grown up just like me."
40:30;40:35;"My boy was just like me."
40:35;40:38;"And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon."
40:38;40:41;"Little boy, blue, and the man on the phone."
40:41;40:44;"When you're coming home, Son, I don't know when."
40:44;40:47;"But we'll get together then."
40:47;40:54;"We're gonna have a good time then."
40:54;40:56;"That was Harry Chapin with Cats in the Cradle."
40:56;40:58;"So I guess that song is almost like,"
40:58;41:00;"that song is basically like Puff the Magic Dragon"
41:00;41:03;"or The Giving Tree, just without the metaphor."
41:03;41:06;"It's like straight up about a parent and a child growing up"
41:06;41:10;"and not really having time for the person that nurtured you."
41:10;41:12;"The most rote, sentimental."
41:12;41:13;"Oh, you don't like this song?"
41:13;41:14;"It's terrible."
41:14;41:15;"Really?"
41:15;41:16;"Oh, God, I hate that song."
41:16;41:18;"I thought you'd like it because it's from the '70s."
41:18;41:20;"I mean, I like the palette of the song, sonically."
41:20;41:22;"You like the sonic palette?"
41:22;41:26;"Yeah, I don't remember it being such a tasty little bass line."
41:26;41:29;"Yeah, it actually sounds kind of good, just arrangement-wise."
41:29;41:35;"I just remember it being this song about the pains of childhood and fatherhood."
41:35;41:41;"Also, I feel like there's no songs that are hit songs like this in 2015."
41:41;41:42;"You know what I mean?"
41:42;41:46;"It's like so '70s that there'd be a hit song by a singer-songwriter"
41:46;41:48;"about your relationship with your parents."
41:48;41:50;"Not that people don't write those songs today,"
41:50;41:52;"but just like this is a hit song."
41:52;41:53;"Yeah."
41:53;41:56;"Do you remember that song by Mike and the Mechanics, The Living Years?"
41:56;41:58;"Oh, yeah, that's also about a dad."
41:58;42:01;"Which is like a super heavy song about a son"
42:01;42:04;"who's reflecting on his recently passed father."
42:04;42:05;"Oh, yeah."
42:05;42:06;"And how he like--"
42:06;42:09;"That's a really good song, and that was like a hit song."
42:09;42:10;"Maybe we should hit that."
42:10;42:12;"Yeah, we should hit that. That's a good song."
42:21;42:30;"Every generation blames the one before"
42:30;42:40;"And all of their frustrations come beating on your door"
42:40;42:45;"I know that I'm a prisoner to all my fatherhell, so dear"
42:45;42:50;"I know that I'm a hostage to all his hopes and fears"
42:50;42:59;"Wish I could have told him in the living years"
42:59;43:04;"Oh, crumpled bits of paper"
43:04;43:09;"Filled with imperfect thought"
43:09;43:14;"Stilted conversations"
43:14;43:19;"I'm afraid that's all we've got"
43:19;43:22;"You say you just don't see it"
43:22;43:24;"He says it's perfect sense"
43:24;43:29;"You just can't get agreement in this present tense"
43:29;43:32;"We all talk a different language"
43:32;43:38;"Talking in defense"
43:38;43:41;"Say it loud"
43:41;43:43;"Say it loud"
43:43;43:45;"Say it clear"
43:45;43:48;"Oh, say it clear"
43:48;43:51;"You can be so"
43:51;43:58;"As well as you hear"
43:58;44:01;"It's too late"
44:01;44:03;"It's too late"
44:03;44:06;"When we die"
44:06;44:08;"When we die"
44:08;44:10;"To admit"
44:10;44:18;"We don't see eye to eye"
44:18;44:23;"So we open up a quarrel"
44:23;44:28;"Between the present and the past"
44:28;44:33;"We only sacrifice the future"
44:33;44:38;"It's the bitterness that lasts"
44:38;44:40;"So don't give to the fortunes"
44:40;44:42;"You sometimes see as fate"
44:42;44:45;"You may have a new perspective"
44:45;44:47;"On a different day"
44:47;44:49;"And if you don't give up"
44:49;44:50;"And don't give in"
44:50;44:56;"You may just be okay"
44:56;45:01;"Say it loud"
45:01;45:04;"Say it clear"
45:04;45:06;"Oh, say it clear"
45:06;45:09;"You can be so"
45:09;45:15;"As well as you hear"
45:15;45:17;"Because it's too late"
45:17;45:19;"It's too late"
45:21;45:23;"When we die"
45:25;45:28;"To admit"
45:28;45:35;"We don't see eye to eye"
45:35;45:40;"I wasn't there that morning"
45:40;45:45;"When my father passed away"
45:45;45:50;"I didn't get to tell him"
45:50;45:55;"All the things I had to say"
45:55;45:58;"I think I caught his spirit"
45:58;46:01;"Later that same year"
46:01;46:03;"I'm sure I heard his echo"
46:03;46:06;"In my baby's newborn tears"
46:06;46:09;"I just wish I could have told him"
46:09;46:14;"In the living years"
46:14;46:20;"So say it loud"
46:20;46:22;"Say it clear"
46:22;46:25;"Oh, say it clear"
46:25;46:28;"You can be so"
46:28;46:35;"As well as you hear"
46:35;46:38;"It's too late"
46:38;46:40;"It's too late"
46:40;46:42;"When we die"
46:42;46:45;"It's too late when we die"
46:45;46:47;"To admit"
46:47;46:53;"We don't see eye to eye"
46:53;46:58;"So say it, say it, say it loud"
46:58;47:00;"Say it loud"
47:00;47:02;"Say it clear"
47:02;47:04;"Oh, say it clear"
47:04;47:06;"Say it loud"
47:06;47:08;"That was Mike and the Mechanic with The Living Years."
47:08;47:11;"I feel like over the past 15, 20 minutes,"
47:11;47:14;"we've kind of covered the entire life cycle--"
47:14;47:17;"growing up, moving away,"
47:17;47:20;"becoming an adult, dealing with death."
47:20;47:23;"It's nice that we can do all that with pop music."
47:23;47:24;"Maybe we should brighten things up."
47:24;47:27;"Maybe it's time to get into some Guided by Voices."
47:27;47:29;"We ready for a rock block with Jake?"
47:29;47:30;"Yeah, man, let's do it."
47:30;47:35;"Time Crisis with Ezra Kanin."
47:35;47:36;"All right, so first of all,"
47:36;47:38;"we've had you on this show"
47:38;47:39;"make a case for the Grateful Dead,"
47:39;47:41;"make a case for the Eagles."
47:41;47:43;"A lot of young kids think those bands are trash."
47:43;47:45;"Some kids don't think they're trash."
47:45;47:47;"I would venture to say that no young kids think"
47:47;47:49;"Guided by Voices are trash"
47:49;47:51;"because they're not familiar with Guided by Voices."
47:51;47:52;"Yeah, I don't know."
47:52;47:54;"I know I'm going to get some kid on Twitter"
47:54;47:56;"who says Guided by Voices is my favorite band."
47:56;47:57;"I'm sure."
47:57;47:58;"Or they're my dad."
47:58;47:59;"What?"
47:59;48:00;"A kid on Twitter might say,"
48:00;48:01;"""Robert Pollard's my dad."""
48:01;48:02;"Oh yeah, Kevin Pollard."
48:02;48:03;"This is going to be like,"
48:03;48:05;"""F--- you, man."""
48:05;48:06;"No, first of all,"
48:06;48:08;"I have nothing against Guided by Voices."
48:08;48:11;"I think Guided by Voices are a cool band."
48:11;48:13;"But they're interesting"
48:13;48:16;"because they remind us so much"
48:16;48:18;"of this kind of like vanished world."
48:18;48:19;"You know what I mean?"
48:19;48:21;"It's like Guided by Voices,"
48:21;48:24;"it's like art from Vienna in the '20s."
48:24;48:25;"You know?"
48:25;48:26;"Like vanished world."
48:26;48:29;"Do you mean like DIY '90s indie rock"
48:29;48:31;"recorded on a four track?"
48:31;48:33;"I mean like pre-internet."
48:33;48:34;"They're regional."
48:34;48:35;"Because where are they from?"
48:35;48:36;"Ohio?"
48:36;48:37;"Dayton, Ohio, yeah."
48:37;48:38;"There's something about them being like"
48:38;48:41;"this regional band that built a cult following"
48:41;48:43;"very slowly through touring."
48:43;48:44;"I mean..."
48:44;48:48;"I feel like they're the classic college rock band."
48:48;48:51;"Yeah, and college rock totally fell apart"
48:51;48:52;"with the student loan crisis,"
48:52;48:53;"so that's over."
48:53;48:54;"That's..."
48:54;48:55;"Bye, college rock."
48:55;48:56;"So why don't you explain to us"
48:56;48:57;"who are Guided by Voices"
48:57;48:58;"and what do they mean to you?"
48:58;48:59;"Okay, well,"
48:59;49:01;"they're one of my favorite bands for sure."
49:01;49:03;"Definitely my favorite band from that era"
49:03;49:05;"of the '90s."
49:05;49:06;"We're talking '90s indie rock,"
49:06;49:08;"Matador Records, that kind of thing."
49:08;49:10;"They were formed in Dayton, Ohio,"
49:10;49:12;"in the early '80s."
49:12;49:14;"This guy named Bob Pollard"
49:14;49:16;"is the primary songwriter and singer,"
49:16;49:18;"and they released a lot of..."
49:18;49:20;"They released like five albums"
49:20;49:22;"in utter obscurity in the '80s,"
49:22;49:24;"meaning they would record a record"
49:24;49:26;"at a little recording studio or at home"
49:26;49:27;"and then press 500 copies,"
49:27;49:29;"and that was kind of the deal."
49:29;49:30;"And then some of their records"
49:30;49:32;"started to get to cool people in New York."
49:32;49:34;"I know that Matt Sweeney"
49:34;49:36;"was an early big fan of theirs"
49:36;49:38;"and sort of like went to bat for them."
49:38;49:39;"He was in the band Chavez?"
49:39;49:40;"Yeah."
49:40;49:41;"Right."
49:41;49:42;"And some of the records they were making"
49:42;49:44;"in the early '90s sort of got into hands"
49:44;49:46;"of cool tastemaker people in New York."
49:46;49:48;"They released a record in '94"
49:48;49:49;"called ""B-1000,"""
49:49;49:52;"and at that point, Bob Pollard was like 36."
49:52;49:54;"He'd been teaching fourth grade"
49:54;49:56;"for about 12 years."
49:56;49:58;"So unusually old to suddenly become"
49:58;50:02;"the toast of big city music people."
50:02;50:05;"I remember the first time I saw them live,"
50:05;50:07;"it was in '96, '97,"
50:07;50:09;"and it was before the Internet"
50:09;50:10;"was really a thing."
50:10;50:12;"I wasn't in the habit of Googling bands"
50:12;50:14;"or watching videos on YouTube."
50:14;50:17;"So I had no idea what they even looked like"
50:17;50:18;"or how they were live."
50:18;50:19;"And I remember listening to these records."
50:19;50:20;"That's crazy."
50:20;50:22;"Yeah, so I remember listening to these records,"
50:22;50:24;"and they were sort of like lo-fi,"
50:24;50:25;"homemade records."
50:25;50:27;"So I just kind of assumed that live"
50:27;50:30;"they would be this sort of like shoegazy,"
50:30;50:34;"pretty introverted, kind of mellow show."
50:34;50:36;"And then when I got to the show,"
50:36;50:38;"it was like this crazy rock show."
50:38;50:40;"Did you ever see them live, Ethan?"
50:40;50:44;"Yeah, but probably not until mid-2000s."
50:44;50:45;"Okay, yeah."
50:45;50:47;"So I remember going and not even knowing"
50:47;50:48;"who Bob Pollard was,"
50:48;50:50;"and then he just came out on stage,"
50:50;50:52;"and he didn't even play guitar."
50:52;50:53;"He just sang."
50:53;50:55;"Which in the context of indie rock"
50:55;50:58;"in the mid-'90s was kind of a crazy move"
50:58;51:01;"to just go out there and just be singing"
51:01;51:03;"and twirling the mic like he's Roger Daltrey"
51:03;51:04;"or something."
51:04;51:06;"And so I think they're great records."
51:06;51:09;"There's this really savvy relationship"
51:09;51:12;"between their recorded output"
51:12;51:15;"and their live performance of those songs"
51:15;51:17;"was really, really different."
51:17;51:18;"Where should we start?"
51:18;51:19;"Alien Lands, Guided by Voices,"
51:19;51:21;"this is one of their big albums, 1995."
51:21;51:23;"Yeah, this is maybe my favorite record of theirs."
51:23;51:24;"It was released in '95."
51:24;51:26;"Let's start with Game of Pricks."
51:26;51:27;"I mean, that's one of my favorite songs."
51:27;51:28;"I love this recording."
51:28;51:31;"If I imagine what a band would sound like"
51:31;51:32;"playing in a garage,"
51:32;51:34;"and they somehow perfectly recorded it"
51:34;51:36;"and encapsulated it, that's what it sounds like to me."
51:36;51:38;"I don't know if this is a Boombox recording"
51:38;51:39;"or a 4-track recording"
51:39;51:41;"made to sound like a Boombox recording."
51:41;51:43;"Bob's voice is really sweet and high,"
51:43;51:45;"and I love this recording."
51:45;51:47;"All right, let's check it out, Game of Pricks."

01:00:18;01:00:21;"Honestly, there's not that many great rock bands"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"that sound that good right now,"
01:00:23;01:00:27;"but there's bands in Brooklyn playing instruments,"

01:00:40;01:00:42;"I was just listening to that Motor Away song"

01:01:20;01:01:27;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1."
01:01:27;01:01:30;"I think GBV is a pretty unique mix of music, too."
01:01:30;01:01:33;"It's not just a guy that's faithfully trying to write"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"power pop songs in the mode of John Lennon or something."
01:01:36;01:01:41;"It's a weird mix of British Invasion and kind of the 60s."
01:01:41;01:01:43;"Right, he sings with a bit of a British accent."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"There's the 60s British, like Who,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"and American Bubblegum stuff like The Monkees."
01:01:48;01:01:52;"There's also like 70s, weird, kind of like Wire,"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"those kind of bands, punk rock."
01:01:54;01:01:58;"And it's sort of like a really unique amalgam."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"And also, I don't want to reduce Bob Pollard"
01:02:00;01:02:03;"to just a collage of his influences."
01:02:03;01:02:06;"I think he was just born an artist."
01:02:06;01:02:08;"He was very ambitious artistically"
01:02:08;01:02:12;"and then was not trying to make it into a career."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"Right."
01:02:13;01:02:17;"I mean, it's a really lovely story"
01:02:17;01:02:20;"and I think it reflects in his early music, especially."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"So how about one more song from Alien Lens"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"to take us out of our GBV rock block?"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"I don't think we're going to do one more."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I think we're going to do three more."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"Oh!"

01:02:29;01:02:31;"We're going to do My Valuable Hunting Knife"

01:02:36;01:02:38;"Also about a minute and a half."
01:02:38;01:02:41;"So we're looking at about three and a half minutes of music."

01:25:20;01:25:21;"- Yeah, a little bit."
01:25:21;01:25:22;"- How does it strike you?"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"- I remember Jamie Foxx telling the whole story"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"about our city also being known as Rock City."
01:25:27;01:25:29;"- Right, 'cause they're producers,"
01:25:29;01:25:30;"been doing their thing for a minute."
01:25:30;01:25:32;"So you guys like the song?"

01:25:41;01:25:43;"- In general, or?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"- Maybe you should start doing six through 10."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"- On the whole song?"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"- Maybe we gotta start doing six through 10."
01:25:47;01:25:49;"- On the whole segment, or just this song?"
01:25:49;01:25:50;"- Well, we'll see, we'll see."

01:27:08;01:27:10;"- What do you think he's saying?"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"- I only call you when it's half past five."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"- Okay, that's what the actual lyric is."

01:27:29;01:27:29;"- He likes to sweat."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"- Oh, no, no."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"- Like, that's his summer girl."
01:27:31;01:27:35;"- First of all, this whole thing,"
01:27:35;01:27:38;"some people claim to have seasonal relationships."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- Summer babe."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"- Like a summer babe."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"- Summer fling."
01:27:41;01:27:43;"- Summer babe, summer fling, that song from Grease."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"So I thought, so The Hills,"
01:27:45;01:27:48;"I assume he's talking about the Hollywood Hills"
01:27:48;01:27:49;"out here in Los Angeles."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"- Definitely."
01:27:50;01:27:52;"- So, and he says some (beep) about,"
01:27:52;01:27:53;"oh, you live in the gated residential."
01:27:53;01:27:55;"So what does this imply about the woman?"
01:27:55;01:27:56;"- She's rich."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"- She's rich."
01:27:58;01:28:02;"And when it's really hot out, brutal summer,"
01:28:02;01:28:03;"you wanna be at a rich person's house"
01:28:03;01:28:04;"or a poor person's house?"
01:28:04;01:28:06;"- Rich, they have a pool."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"- They have a pool, and what else do they have?"
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- Central AC."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"- Central AC."
01:28:09;01:28:12;"And I'm saying, even if you're down,"
01:28:12;01:28:14;"even if you hate rich people,"
01:28:14;01:28:17;"that time of year, the class struggle is out the window."
01:28:17;01:28:19;"- So you're saying that this guy in the song"
01:28:19;01:28:21;"doesn't have AC?"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"- Obviously The Weeknd has AC, so I take it back."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"- I wanna return to Adam Levine."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- I don't even wanna talk about Adam Levine anymore."
01:28:26;01:28:29;"- He's made a career out of being mild."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"I'm not a fan."
01:28:30;01:28:33;"And when you said it's our city featuring Adam Levine,"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"I had a huge bias."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"And I actually tuned out."
01:28:37;01:28:38;"Like when you said his name, I was like,"
01:28:38;01:28:39;"I'm not even listening to this,"
01:28:39;01:28:42;"'cause I just, I hate Maroon 5."
01:28:43;01:28:46;"- That guy is like the most mild, uninteresting guy."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"- You wanna hear some Adam Levine gossip?"
01:28:48;01:28:49;"- Yeah."
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- I went with my friend recently,"
01:28:51;01:28:52;"I think I was telling Ethan about this the other night,"
01:28:52;01:28:56;"I went with my friend to this like hardcore fitness trainer."
01:28:56;01:28:59;"She had an appointment 'cause she knew this guy,"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"and she's like, you wanna come meet this guy,"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"'cause this guy'll drop some knowledge on you."
01:29:02;01:29:03;"This guy's famous, man."
01:29:03;01:29:06;"He's the guy who got Chris Pratt not fat."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"- Okay, wow."
01:29:07;01:29:10;"- This guy was, I'm sitting in his office,"
01:29:10;01:29:12;"listening to him give his spiel to my friend,"
01:29:12;01:29:13;"and I'm looking on the wall,"
01:29:13;01:29:15;"all sorts of celebrities and this and that."
01:29:15;01:29:16;"I don't know if he works with him,"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"or he just like seeing him around,"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"'cause people in LA, everybody just sees each other"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"at the gym and stuff, and he was just saying like,"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"hey, you know who's killing it right now?"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"I said, who?"
01:29:25;01:29:26;"And he said, Adam Levine."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"He looks better than Brad Pitt in Fight Club,"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"he stopped doing yoga,"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"and he started just like beefing up and lifting weights,"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"'cause he was always in good shape."
01:29:34;01:29:36;"But basically in the fitness community in LA,"
01:29:36;01:29:37;"Adam Levine's body's the talk of the town."
01:29:37;01:29:39;"- It's gonna make him write better songs."
01:29:39;01:29:42;"- Yeah, so does that change how you feel about Maroon 5?"
01:29:42;01:29:44;"- It confirms everything that I thought."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"I was not making the point that just 'cause--"
01:29:45;01:29:49;"- I'm tired of these Guided By Voices loving indie dudes"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"who are body shaming jacked guys."
01:29:51;01:29:52;"- Yeah."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Just 'cause Levine cares about his body"
01:29:54;01:29:55;"more than Bob Pollard doesn't mean"
01:29:55;01:29:56;"he can't make good music, right?"
01:29:56;01:29:58;"- Guys, I was off, you know what?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"I was so out of line."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"- All right, you go ahead, Jeff Pollard."
01:30:02;01:30:05;"- I wanna apologize publicly to you and Adam Levine."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"- Thank you."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"Adam Levine, your jacked body is the talk of the town."
01:30:09;01:30:11;"I literally can't go to a gym in LA"
01:30:11;01:30:13;"without hearing about it, so congratulations on that."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"Now here's number three, finally a new song,"
01:30:16;01:30:18;"probably for most of the world this is not a new song."
01:30:18;01:30:20;"I haven't heard it yet, 'cause this is not only"
01:30:20;01:30:21;"just released as a single."

01:32:07;01:32:10;"- That 1989 is Taylor talking about Obama destroying America."

01:39:59;01:40:02;"because he's in great shape, but I'm sorry."
01:40:02;01:40:06;"Just like, it disgusts me that he would take advantage"
01:40:06;01:40:08;"of a bunch of college students in North Carolina"

01:57:55;01:57:56;"(laughing)"
01:57:56;01:57:57;"- Yeah, he worked there."
01:57:57;01:57:58;"- He was only about managing the--"
01:57:58;01:58:00;"- That might be revisionist history."
01:58:00;01:58:01;"He worked there, I know that he worked there."
01:58:01;01:58:03;"- He went there once."
01:58:03;01:58:05;"- It's amazing to think about Axl holding down a day job."
01:58:05;01:58:06;"- Right, just like full time."
01:58:06;01:58:08;"- Yeah."
01:58:08;01:58:09;"- And also like him working up the ranks,"
01:58:09;01:58:11;"just like Axl, you've been doing a great job"
01:58:11;01:58:12;"here at Tower Records."
01:58:12;01:58:14;"I'm ready to promote you."
01:58:14;01:58:15;"- Are you ready to be manager?"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"Are you ready to be manager?"
01:58:16;01:58:17;"- I've told Regional about you."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"(laughing)"
01:58:19;01:58:22;"- You've been honored, employee of the month, Axl Rose."
01:58:22;01:58:26;"- We're gonna step up your rate to about 6.75 an hour."
01:58:26;01:58:27;"(laughing)"
01:58:27;01:58:30;"- You think 6.75 in like early 80s?"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"- Okay."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"- 3.75."
01:58:32;01:58:34;"- My inflation math was way off."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Yeah, you're totally right, like circa 85."
01:58:36;01:58:39;"- You've been pulling down 4.25 an hour."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"- Yep."
01:58:40;01:58:42;"- Plus the 25% employee discount."
01:58:42;01:58:43;"- Right."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"- So you're gonna do a 35% employee discount"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"and bump up your salary to 6 an hour."
01:58:47;01:58:49;"Congratulations, Axl."
01:58:49;01:58:50;"(laughing)"
01:58:50;01:58:53;"Wow, it's another bygone era."
01:58:53;01:58:54;"It's been great having you guys on the show."
01:58:54;01:58:56;"This has been a very emotional episode,"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"as all time crises are."
01:58:58;01:59:02;"We really learned a lot about pop culture today, I think."
01:59:02;01:59:04;"Thank you to my sister Emma for coming through"
01:59:04;01:59:05;"on the early side."
01:59:05;01:59:07;"And thank you, Jake."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"- Yeah, man, always."
01:59:09;01:59:10;"- And thank you, Ethan."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"- Yeah, it was a pleasure."
01:59:11;01:59:14;"- It's been especially wonderful having you guys here."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"Will the next show be in New York or LA?"
01:59:16;01:59:17;"I wonder."
01:59:17;01:59:19;"No matter what, we're gonna check in with Despot and Asher."
01:59:19;01:59:21;"Stay tuned for more Beats 1 Radio."
