00:22;00:27;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:27;00:29;"Thank you."
00:47;01:16;"â™ª"
01:16;01:19;"Time crisis, back again."
01:19;01:23;"What's up fellas? We got Jake and Nick today, no Seinfeld."
01:23;01:25;"Number 201."
01:25;01:27;"201, alright yeah."
01:27;01:30;"We made it over the 200 hump."
01:30;01:32;"So everybody's been on the road."
01:32;01:34;"I did four nights in Dayton."
01:34;01:35;"Oh hell yeah."
01:35;01:36;"Where do you fly into?"
01:36;01:39;"Well, it's not easy."
01:39;01:41;"I flew into Columbus."
01:41;01:46;"I took a 5.45am flight out of LAX,"
01:46;01:50;"which necessitated me leaving my house at 3.15am"
01:50;01:55;"to drive to the long-term parking at LAX."
01:55;02:01;"I was on the shuttle to go to the airport from the parking garage at 3.58am."
02:01;02:02;"No."
02:02;02:07;"Parking shuttle was packed at 3.58am because you know."
02:07;02:11;"Everybody was heading to Dayton. FLA was gone."
02:11;02:16;"Everyone was heading out to the GBV 40th anniversary shows in Dayton."
02:16;02:22;"So yeah, I flew to Columbus, landed there around like 1, rented a car,"
02:22;02:29;"and then just started driving around office parks and chain retail strips in Columbus."
02:29;02:30;"Yes, you do."
02:30;02:36;"And kind of made my way along some kind of more rural routes through some farm country to get to Dayton."
02:36;02:37;"Real quick, Jake."
02:37;02:39;"I just want to rewind for a second."
02:39;02:43;"When you have a psychotically early call like that,"
02:43;02:47;"so what time were you setting your alarm to make it?"
02:47;02:53;"I set the alarm for 3.05am and I was out the door at 3.15am."
02:53;02:57;"So in those 10 minutes, are you brewing a pot of coffee?"
02:57;02:59;"No, just going water."
02:59;03:03;"Do you have your clothes prepped to just throw on and run?"
03:03;03:08;"Yeah, obviously backpacked, outfit for the next day for the flight."
03:08;03:15;"You went to sleep at 11.30pm in a Guided by Voices t-shirt and a fresh pair of jeans to save time."
03:15;03:17;"[laughter]"
03:17;03:20;"Up and out."
03:20;03:24;"We actually taped episode 200 the night before."
03:24;03:25;"Right."
03:25;03:29;"I got home at like 9 or something, packed."
03:29;03:33;"Yeah, it's just like an awkward, you don't really, like, I'm also kind of a light sleeper."
03:33;03:38;"So it was an awkward night, like just like, ""Alright, I'm going to turn off the light."""
03:38;03:42;"Like, yeah, right around 11, 11.30, alarm set for 3.05am."
03:42;03:44;"Are you sleeping in a different room?"
03:44;03:45;"No."
03:45;03:46;"Not really a question."
03:46;03:50;"But I had everything outside the door, so I didn't even turn on the light."
03:50;03:53;"Alarm went off. I was already kind of half awake."
03:53;03:55;"You turned the alarm off like first ring?"
03:55;03:56;"Immediately."
03:56;04:03;"Then just like got up, just walked out of the room, closed the bedroom door, put on my clothes like in the bathroom."
04:03;04:11;"As you slipped out the door, did you just hear half asleep Hannah say, ""Have a great time at the GBV 40th gig?"""
04:11;04:14;"She said, ""The club is open."""
04:14;04:16;"I hope they play Quality of Armor."
04:57;04:59;"When did you have your first coffee?"
04:59;05:05;"So you're a shell of a man driving to the airport, feeling insane at 3.15."
05:05;05:12;"You know, by the time you're in, yeah, like the hardest part is just sort of anticipating the alarm going off at 3.05."
05:12;05:17;"And then like that sort of like nauseous early morning, like lack of sleep feeling."
05:17;05:21;"But then like I filled up my 32 ounce water bottle."
05:21;05:23;"I did an unusual move."
05:23;05:26;"I put in like some powdered electrolytes."
05:26;05:28;"Oh yeah, that's a good move."
05:28;05:31;"And I was just sort of like, I need a little something because I don't want to just drink coffee."
05:31;05:34;"I'm not going to brew coffee at 3.05 in the morning."
05:34;05:38;"And I also don't want to just like drink coffee, empty stomach style."
05:38;05:41;"I'm just going to like, I'm just going to like muscle this."
05:41;05:47;"I'm just going to like have my electrolyte water with ice in it in my water bottle."
05:47;05:48;"I'm going to get straight in the car."
05:48;05:51;"I'm going to put on 1992's Propeller album."
05:51;05:53;"And just, it's pitch black."
05:53;05:56;"And I'm just going to start driving to the airport."
05:56;05:59;"You know, at that hour, it takes like maybe a half hour."
05:59;06:02;"I live 25 miles from the airport."
06:02;06:04;"I mean, that's the advantage of going at that hour."
06:04;06:07;"It's brutal, but like, man, it's easy to get there."
06:07;06:08;"You're flying."
06:08;06:12;"I'm on the shuttle by, you know, 3.58."
06:12;06:13;"I get to the airport."
06:13;06:14;"Boom."
06:14;06:15;"I'm already checked in."
06:15;06:17;"No bags to check, two carry-ons."
06:17;06:20;"It's Spirit Airlines direct to Columbus."
06:20;06:21;"Let's go."
06:21;06:24;"So when did you finally have a coffee on the plane?"
06:24;06:30;"Yes, because when I first arrived at the gate, all the restaurants and coffee shops were still closed."
06:30;06:34;"And then there was like a coffee bean and tea leaf that opened."
06:34;06:37;"And then I like, in a blink of an eye, the line was like 50 people deep."
06:37;06:38;"I was like, uh-uh."
06:38;06:47;"So then I just got on the plane and I got one hot chocolate and one coffee in an empty cup."
06:47;06:48;"And I combined them."
06:48;06:54;"I anticipated the coffee at Spirit Airlines at like 6 a.m. being pretty rough stuff."
06:54;06:56;"And so I kind of just combined."
06:56;06:59;"I made kind of like a makeshift mocha."
06:59;07:03;"Like half hot chocolate, half coffee, which I'll do in a pinch."
07:03;07:04;"You know, I did that."
07:04;07:08;"As you say that, I recall hearing that that's one of your moves."
07:08;07:13;"When we were in the hospital for like four days when Lizzie was born and it was during COVID."
07:13;07:14;"The coffee was so bad."
07:14;07:17;"We couldn't get food from outside, you know, it was during COVID."
07:17;07:21;"And that's what I would do every day, the cocoa coffee combo."
07:21;07:27;"So yeah, I rocked the coffee, then I kind of slept, landed in Columbus at 1, got on the rental."
07:27;07:35;"Then I started texting you guys and I hit up Slob's Diner in Columbus and crushed a Greek omelet."
07:35;07:37;"Set me straight."
07:37;07:39;"And then I just started shooting pictures like crazy."
07:39;07:41;"And made my way to Dayton."
07:41;07:48;"Bit of a pilgrimage, honestly, because, you know, it's like people go see like the big pink house in Saugerties."
07:48;07:56;"Or they go to Graceland in Memphis or, you know, they go to Prince's Compound, wherever that is in Minnesota."
07:56;08:03;"You know, I've had such a, like a decades long, intense fandom of Guided By Voices."
08:03;08:06;"And so Dayton, Ohio has loomed large in my imagination."
08:06;08:08;"I'd never been there."
08:08;08:16;"And this felt like a really like significant sort of personal journey I had to take on like by myself."
08:16;08:21;"And I was really curious to like see Dayton and like obviously go to these shows."
08:21;08:25;"They're doing two hometown shows for their 40th anniversary."
08:25;08:29;"And also I was obviously going there to shoot photographs."
08:29;08:35;"So it's sort of like a work, part artwork trip and part rock and roll pilgrimage."
08:35;08:41;"I listened to a lot of early GBV driving around Dayton and exurb in Dayton."
08:41;08:49;"And just like, just kind of vibing in a way I've never done before quite with like a place and a musician."
08:49;08:53;"And sounds like probably a few people were doing that."
08:53;08:59;"You were like telling us some like fairly well-known English actor was out of the shows."
08:59;09:01;"People were like coming internationally for this."
09:01;09:12;"Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, the second night I was there, Thursday night, there was a GBV cover band showcase at this bar called The Yellow Cab."
09:12;09:14;"And a lot of people were doing like acoustic sets."
09:14;09:17;"I was sort of kicking myself. I was like, man, I wish I had been more tapped in on this community."
09:17;09:24;"I could have prepared a George Boy Voyage set because I did a couple of George Boy Voyage sets like 10 years ago."
09:24;09:27;"What I would just do acoustic Pollard songs."
09:27;09:32;"I would do like all his like 45 second songs and I would just like stack them back to back."
09:32;09:37;"And then, yeah, this guy, Paddy Constantine, Constadine, I'm not trying to say his name."
09:37;09:41;"Paddy, Paddy Constadine and his son."
09:41;09:42;"Constadine."
09:43;09:46;"Right. Yeah. You reckon. Yeah. He's in everything."
09:46;09:49;"He's in like some of the Bourne movie or one of the Bourne movies."
09:49;09:51;"He's in like one of the Game of Thrones."
09:51;09:53;"He's in the House of the Dragon."
09:53;09:56;"Yeah. He's 5'11""."
09:56;10:00;"He had the most insane Guided by Voices tattoo on his bicep."
10:00;10:05;"It was like an image of like Bob Pollard circa like 1996."
10:05;10:10;"Like, like holding a mic, but also like eating a shark or something."
10:10;10:16;"There was a little like, like a blurb about it on Stereogum, I think."
10:16;10:20;"But he was doing his set with his son. It was very cute."
10:20;10:22;"He like got up there. He's probably like my age or something."
10:22;10:26;"Maybe a little older. Maybe he's pushing 50 and his son's probably like 20."
10:26;10:30;"And his son got up there and played guitar and sang Harmony."
10:30;10:35;"And then Paddy Constadine, being the actor he is, he had the kind of like Pollard stance."
10:35;10:40;"But they did and like, yeah, it was very fun to see all the covers"
10:40;10:44;"because everyone is busting out like the deepest, the deepest stuff."
10:44;10:46;"No one was doing Motor Away and I'm a Scientist."
10:46;10:49;"It was all like real deep cuts."
10:49;10:53;"And then this band, this local Dayton band closed out the cover set with"
10:53;10:59;"they performed 1996's Not in My Air Force, which is a Pollard solo album"
10:59;11:04;"in its entirety in order, which was amazing."
11:04;11:09;"â™ª To be numb, to be numb â™ª"
11:09;11:18;"â™ª I feel counted and it's fine â™ª"
11:18;11:24;"â™ª I'm only more than the prize â™ª"
11:25;11:37;"â™ª â™ª"
11:37;11:44;"â™ª In the storm of life â™ª"
11:44;11:46;"â™ª From the ground up â™ª"
11:46;11:51;"â™ª Sheet of vomit in the sky â™ª"
11:51;11:58;"â™ª From countless scattered lies â™ª"
11:58;12:04;"â™ª You might wonder someday â™ª"
12:04;12:12;"â™ª You might wonder one day â™ª"
12:12;12:17;"â™ª My, my, my â™ª"
12:17;12:23;"â™ª When the eagle flies â™ª"
12:23;12:30;"â™ª I just wanna change your world so much â™ª"
12:30;12:38;"â™ª Take this moment back in time to fly â™ª"
12:38;12:44;"â™ª What a better life â™ª"
12:44;12:45;"What's Dayton like?"
12:45;12:48;"Dayton, I was staying at a hotel downtown."
12:48;12:52;"It's a rust belt town."
12:52;12:58;"I've never seen so many new breweries in such a small square,"
12:58;13:01;"in so few city blocks is what I'm trying to say."
13:01;13:04;"Like brew pubs where they have a giant tank?"
13:04;13:11;"There were a lot of older brick industrial buildings that were,"
13:11;13:15;"you know, I'm going to guess from the early 20th century."
13:15;13:17;"I don't know if they had been abandoned for a while,"
13:17;13:19;"but they'd all been recently repurposed."
13:19;13:21;"They're all breweries now,"
13:21;13:25;"which kind of reminded me of our friends at Modern Methods Brewery"
13:25;13:30;"out of Warren, Ohio, who made the Mountain Brews brew last year."
13:30;13:32;"Maybe there's just like a big brewery scene in Ohio,"
13:32;13:37;"but there were like five breweries just like within like two blocks of my hotel."
13:37;13:40;"What was like the aesthetic vibe of these places?"
13:40;13:43;"Kind of like you might see in any city,"
13:43;13:51;"like high ceiling, white tile, you know, refurbished brick."
13:51;13:54;"I realized when I got to Dayton, I was like, oh, this is like,"
13:54;13:58;"this is the house style of this era."
13:58;14:01;"Right. Not even particularly Ohio East."
14:01;14:06;"Something you could find in Massachusetts, California,"
14:06;14:10;"like big brewery."
14:10;14:13;"Did you hit any? What was on the menu?"
14:13;14:14;"They all have a couple."
14:14;14:17;"$22 loaded nacho."
14:17;14:22;"Yeah. I mean, the food that the place that I went to had dinner"
14:22;14:23;"was a little more elevated."
14:23;14:27;"It was like, you know, like a fancy Caesar salad."
14:27;14:28;"I'm not good at like this."
14:28;14:33;"Yeah, I'm not like great at reciting details off menus."
14:33;14:38;"Yeah. Like, you know, just like, yeah, like a $19 burger or,"
14:38;14:43;"you know, fresh house made pasta with."
14:43;14:45;"And everything has a little tweak to elevate it."
14:45;14:50;"Like the burger has some kind of like relish or like blue cheese."
14:50;14:52;"Blue cheese. Exactly."
14:52;14:54;"Something a little bit."
14:54;14:58;"The food was good. I mean, yeah, it's a pretty city."
14:58;15:01;"I mean, it's walking around at night. It was pretty empty."
15:01;15:05;"You know, it's kind of one of those like downtowns that by 10 o'clock,"
15:05;15:06;"there's not a lot going on."
15:06;15:10;"Could you feel it in the air that this was like the GBV takeover?"
15:10;15:14;"Like, is it a small enough town that you could like just walking around,"
15:14;15:16;"driving around? Yes."
15:16;15:20;"You could like sense that this is like a major event."
15:20;15:23;"Well, yes and no. I would say after night one,"
15:23;15:28;"because they played Friday and Saturday nights of Labor Day weekend."
15:28;15:32;"Friday night, I like, I went to this brewery by myself,"
15:32;15:36;"had dinner and I saw some other people who were clearly headed to the show."
15:36;15:38;"They were wearing merch or this thing."
15:38;15:40;"And I had that vibe. And what was the,"
15:40;15:44;"a bunch of like 48 year old guys? Head nods, high fives."
15:44;15:49;"Yeah. Well, yeah. So then like on Saturday after night one,"
15:49;15:52;"I was walking from my hotel to this breakfast place."
15:52;15:57;"And like, I saw like, like every other shirt was a GBV shirt."
15:57;15:59;"And I was like, I'm going to go to this place."
21:09;21:11;"Yola Tango."
21:11;21:13;"Yeah, that's something."
21:13;21:15;"Bounce a Bastion. I mean, different. You get into slightly different micro generations."
21:17;21:19;"Yola Tango feels, if you threw out Pavement,"
21:19;21:21;"Yola Tango feels now, Dinosaur Jr.,"
21:21;21:23;"BTS,"
21:23;21:25;"Yola Tango, all on different"
21:25;21:27;"nights opening for this"
21:27;21:29;"special GBV. Like, that feels clean."
21:29;21:31;"Yeah. There were other bands"
21:31;21:33;"too. There was, there were kind of too many bands"
21:33;21:35;"to be honest, if I'm going to nitpick."
21:35;21:37;"Because then Night 2,"
21:37;21:39;"this band Wednesday opened."
21:39;21:41;"I like Wednesday."
21:41;21:43;"Oh, that's a newer band, right?"
21:43;21:45;"Yep. And then this band,"
21:45;21:47;"The Heartless Bastards,"
21:47;21:49;"opened up too."
21:49;21:51;"I missed the Wednesday and Heartless Bastards"
21:51;21:53;"portion of the night because I"
21:53;21:55;"couldn't sign up for like five and a half hours"
21:55;21:57;"with the music. Yeah, you got to protect"
21:57;21:59;"those ears. Yeah, because GBV"
21:59;22:01;"is going to play for two. It's tough"
22:01;22:03;"crossing the generations."
22:03;22:05;"I guess sometimes that works."
22:05;22:07;"But I kind of feel like, yeah, if it's like"
22:07;22:09;"a younger band opening for an older band, I guess"
22:09;22:11;"that's kind of like time tested."
22:11;22:13;"Yeah, I think that's cool."
22:13;22:15;"Sorry, I'm still thinking about various"
22:15;22:17;"big fours. Big fours?"
22:17;22:19;"There could be a big four"
22:19;22:21;"rap show. Jay-Z,"
22:21;22:23;"Kanye,"
22:23;22:25;"see, you already get into these like funny"
22:25;22:27;"Jay-Z, Kanye,"
22:27;22:29;"Wayne?"
22:29;22:31;"Wayne. If you did Jay-Z, Kanye,"
22:31;22:33;"Wayne, and Drake, I think that that would"
22:33;22:35;"be considered, and I know Drake's"
22:35;22:37;"post this, but his legacy like"
22:37;22:39;"this. By the time you're talking retirement age."
22:39;22:41;"Yeah, because that would be like a massive"
22:41;22:43;"festival. Honestly, it'll depend which"
22:43;22:45;"way the wind blows because you could see"
22:45;22:47;"no matter what, Kanye, Drake, and Wayne"
22:47;22:49;"I think are our three. And if"
22:49;22:51;"they want to lean a little bit older,"
22:51;22:53;"they'll go Jay-Z. If they want to lean"
22:53;22:55;"a little bit younger, they'll go Travis Scott."
22:55;22:57;"We don't know how it's going to feel."
22:57;22:59;"Eminem."
22:59;23:01;"Jay-Z, Eminem,"
23:01;23:03;"Kid Rock, and Limp Bizkit."
23:03;23:05;"Sign me up."
23:05;23:07;"The big four. That's rough."
23:07;23:09;"It's just one of those days"
23:09;23:11;"when you don't want to wake up. Everything is"
23:11;23:13;"f***ed. Everybody sucks."
23:13;23:15;"You don't really know why, but you want to justify"
23:15;23:17;"someone's head off."
23:17;23:19;"No human contact."
23:19;23:21;"And if you interact, your life is on contract."
23:21;23:23;"You best bet if you stay away,"
23:23;23:25;"mother f***er. It's just one of those"
23:25;23:27;"days. It's all about the he"
23:27;23:29;"says, she says, bulls***."
23:29;23:31;"I think you better quit."
23:33;23:35;"I'm gonna leave you with a fat lip."
23:35;23:37;"It's all about the he says, she says, bulls***."
23:37;23:41;"I think you better quit."
23:41;23:43;"I want to go back to Vampire"
23:43;23:45;"Weekend."
23:45;23:47;"20, 30 year anniversary"
23:47;23:49;"in New York."
23:49;23:51;"40th anniversary."
23:53;23:55;"Three nights. Who's opening up for you each night?"
23:55;23:57;"What was happening in 1983?"
23:57;23:59;"The band formed?"
23:59;24:01;"Yeah. Their first release"
24:01;24:03;"was '86, but"
24:03;24:05;"the band formed in '83."
24:05;24:07;"Oh, wait. That's interesting, because Vampire Weekend"
24:07;24:09;"formed in '06, so"
24:09;24:11;"that means our 40th anniversary"
24:11;24:13;"would be 2046, which"
24:13;24:15;"is also a Wong Kar-wai film."
24:15;24:17;"I like it. If he's still around, maybe"
24:17;24:19;"we could link up with him."
24:19;24:21;"He'll do the concert footage."
24:21;24:23;"Yeah, Wong Kar-wai."
24:23;24:25;"A thousand years old."
24:25;24:27;"It's 2046."
24:27;24:29;"I don't know where. It's not Mercury"
24:29;24:31;"Lounge, where it would be."
24:31;24:33;"But you're going to go back, and you're going to have"
24:33;24:35;"three nights of BW."
24:35;24:37;"Who are you asking to"
24:37;24:39;"open up for you?"
24:39;24:41;"What does Brian"
24:41;24:43;"Cross think is best for the boys?"
24:43;24:45;"I think we'd want to have..."
24:45;24:47;"Well, obviously, the best thing"
24:47;24:49;"to do is not worry about selling"
24:49;24:51;"tickets by putting together"
24:51;24:53;"a killer nostalgia bill."
24:53;24:55;"Of course, what I'd want, I'd want"
24:55;24:57;"F*** Mountain Brews,"
24:57;24:59;"Death Spot,"
24:59;25:01;"Tabor's Choice."
25:01;25:03;"We want the whole extended..."
25:03;25:05;"Local."
25:05;25:07;"You're thinking more of the BW"
25:07;25:09;"family affair. The universe."
25:09;25:11;"More than the..."
25:11;25:13;"I think so. Your extended universe."
25:13;25:15;"But then if my guys come"
25:15;25:17;"and are saying, ""We've got to move these tickets,"""
25:17;25:19;"we need to really beef up..."
25:19;25:21;"People are traveling to New"
25:21;25:23;"Jersey. At this point, Richard"
25:23;25:25;"Pictures is also enormous."
25:25;25:27;"So, I don't know."
25:27;25:29;"At that point, maybe Richard Pictures"
25:29;25:31;"has become the Grateful Dead."
25:31;25:35;"Richard Pictures is doing"
25:35;25:37;"three nights at Dick's Sporting Goods"
25:37;25:39;"in Colorado."
25:39;25:41;"We'd love to make it work, Ezra,"
25:41;25:43;"but our touring schedule is just"
25:43;25:45;"too intense. It's too demanding."
25:45;25:47;"John Mayer's opening for us."
25:47;25:49;"Yeah, I guess"
25:49;25:51;"it depends if we want to do a..."
25:51;25:53;"We've never been an easy fit."
25:53;25:55;"It's always somewhat awkward."
25:55;25:57;"When I think about..."
25:57;25:59;"When I think about a really strong tour,"
25:59;26:01;"I just had a thought. I'd love to round this"
26:01;26:03;"one out, but somebody"
26:03;26:05;"said The Strokes earlier for a"
26:05;26:07;"big four. This one is"
26:07;26:09;"starting to feel exciting to me. I'm actually"
26:09;26:11;"just going to invest in this one as a promoter."
26:11;26:13;"I'm going to put my life savings into"
26:13;26:15;"this and try to get this one off the ground."
26:15;26:17;"The Strokes."
26:17;26:19;"Kings of Leon."
26:19;26:21;"Phoenix."
26:21;26:23;"Arctic Monkeys. Maybe"
26:23;26:25;"Arctic Monkeys, they're too big"
26:25;26:27;"that maybe they're on their own trip."
26:27;26:29;"There's something I like about that because it's"
26:29;26:31;"The Strokes, classic New York"
26:31;26:33;"rock band, Kings of"
26:33;26:35;"Leon, southern fried"
26:35;26:37;"rock band from the same era,"
26:37;26:39;"Phoenix, French,"
26:39;26:41;"Arctic Monkeys, English."
26:41;26:43;"Four iconic regions"
26:43;26:45;"represented through the power of rock"
26:45;26:47;"and roll. That feels strong."
26:47;26:49;"If I'm honest,"
26:49;26:51;"VW's not a great fit in there."
26:51;26:53;"We could hold it down. We could put together"
26:53;26:55;"maybe a rockier set."
26:55;26:57;"That feels like an interesting big four"
26:57;26:59;"tour. Yeah, it's really intense."
26:59;27:01;"Each band playing an hour, you have a four"
27:01;27:03;"hour of just music"
27:03;27:05;"plus the turnover. You're looking at a five"
27:05;27:07;"hour show at the minimum."
27:07;27:09;"It's brutal."
27:09;27:11;"Someone ends up being the headliner."
27:11;27:13;"And they play for two hours?"
27:13;27:15;"Metallica plays for two hours."
27:15;27:17;"Yeah, exactly. Even I'm looking at some of"
27:17;27:19;"the big four branding, it says Metallica"
27:19;27:21;"real big, and then it says"
27:21;27:23;"Slayer, Anthrax, Megadeth"
27:23;27:25;"smaller underneath."
27:25;27:27;"There's a pretty big gulf between"
27:27;27:29;"slot number one and two through four."
27:29;27:31;"Where's the White Stripes fit into"
27:31;27:33;"this big four?"
27:33;27:35;"Well, the White Stripes,"
27:35;27:37;"they were, absolutely"
27:37;27:39;"they had a kind of a synergy with"
27:39;27:41;"The Strokes because they came out at the same time."
27:41;27:43;"And I remember in that era,"
27:43;27:45;"probably like 2002,"
27:45;27:47;"maybe 2003,"
27:47;27:49;"there were a series of shows"
27:49;27:51;"maybe it was just two shows, but it was"
27:51;27:53;"White Stripes opening for The Strokes"
27:53;27:55;"in New York, and then The Strokes"
27:55;27:57;"opening for White Stripes in Detroit."
27:57;27:59;"Which I remember at the time"
27:59;28:01;"hearing about that and being like, ""Oh, that's pretty tight."""
28:01;28:03;"I like that."
28:03;28:05;"You know, two bands. But you know, The White Stripes don't exist"
28:05;28:07;"anymore. Obviously, Jack White still tours."
28:07;28:09;"You know, to take it full circle,"
28:09;28:11;"in that era, I remember GBV and The Strokes"
28:11;28:13;"playing a bunch of shows together too."
28:13;28:15;"Oh yeah. Yeah, The Strokes."
28:15;28:17;"They did some New Year's shows."
28:17;28:19;"I honestly don't know who opened."
28:19;28:21;"I would assume GBV opened."
28:21;28:23;"That was kind of like The Strokes being this hot new band"
28:23;28:25;"and paying some respect to their"
28:25;28:27;"elders."
28:27;28:29;"Yeah, I'm not sure about that."
28:29;28:31;"That's interesting."
28:31;28:33;"The truth is with this conversation, I can't get too deep."
28:33;28:35;"I'd get a little bit inside baseball"
28:35;28:37;"and also I'd have to say too many provocative"
28:37;28:39;"things if I really started going through"
28:39;28:41;"all my thoughts about all the bands"
28:41;28:43;"from our era and who we wanted to tour with."
28:43;28:45;"As a show promoter."
28:45;28:47;"Yeah, if I just..."
28:47;28:49;"If Time Crisis just goes full mask off music business,"
28:49;28:51;"I'll be like, ""They're not worth"
28:51;28:53;"sh*t in f*cking Chicago, man."""
28:53;28:55;"I don't give a f*ck how good"
28:55;28:57;"the reviews were for that record, man."
28:57;28:59;"They're not selling tickets."
28:59;29:01;"No, I don't like that for my guys."
29:01;29:03;"But no matter what, I think"
29:03;29:05;"I would just... Yeah, I would hope it's not"
29:05;29:07;"for a long time that we do that kind of like"
29:07;29:09;"nostalgia package."
29:09;29:11;"Although when it feels right,"
29:11;29:13;"those tours are great."
29:13;29:15;"When it doesn't feel like some try hard"
29:15;29:17;"like... You know, did I say on the show"
29:17;29:19;"how I went to the Culture Club"
29:19;29:21;"at the Hollywood Bowl? Yeah."
29:21;29:23;"Maybe not on the show,"
29:23;29:25;"but yeah, you sent us photos. I think it was"
29:25;29:27;"after 200. And that was a great vibe."
29:27;29:29;"Actually, Culture Club crushed it"
29:29;29:31;"and the opener was Berlin."
29:31;29:33;"That felt like a little random."
29:33;29:35;"It was just kind of like 80s fest."
29:35;29:37;"Sure. And all due respect to Berlin,"
29:37;29:39;"Terry Nunn's got a great voice."
29:39;29:41;"She came out at the end of Culture Club"
29:41;29:43;"set and did a cover"
29:43;29:45;"of ""Bang a Gong"" by T-Rex."
29:45;29:47;"Tight."
29:47;29:49;"Interesting surprise."
29:49;29:51;"I couldn't help but think because as I walked"
29:51;29:53;"in, who do I see sitting in"
29:53;29:55;"one of the iconic boxes at the Hollywood"
29:55;29:57;"Bowl, but another"
29:57;29:59;"80s iconic Brit,"
29:59;30:01;"British singer, not Boy George,"
30:01;30:03;"but Morrissey."
30:03;30:05;"Just sitting there sitting."
30:05;30:07;"Watching the show? He was just watching"
30:07;30:09;"the show. There was kind of like a buzz."
30:09;30:11;"We sat down and even the people"
30:11;30:13;"next to us just were making conversation like,"
30:13;30:15;"""You see Morrissey's here?"" And I was like, ""I did see Morrissey"
30:15;30:17;"was here."" And they're kind of"
30:17;30:19;"like people probably in their 40s and they were just"
30:19;30:21;"going on like, ""Wow."
30:21;30:23;"You think he's going to go on stage?"" And I was like,"
30:23;30:25;"""I don't think so. He's sitting in the crowd."
30:25;30:27;"I don't think he's about to go on stage."" And Boy"
30:27;30:29;"George made a lot of references"
30:29;30:31;"to the fact that Morrissey"
30:31;30:33;"was there. And"
30:33;30:35;"I don't know for sure, but I assume Morrissey left"
30:35;30:37;"early. I bet he felt a little bit uncomfortable."
30:37;30:39;"Was he making references that he"
30:39;30:41;"was psyched that Morrissey was here? Or"
30:41;30:43;"was there some aggression?"
30:43;30:45;"I wouldn't say aggression,"
30:45;30:47;"but you know, Boy George,"
30:47;30:49;"he's, you know,"
30:49;30:51;"an absolute legend."
30:51;30:53;"But he's got his kind of like cheeky wink"
30:53;30:55;"in the way he says stuff. So he's kind of like,"
30:55;30:57;"""Morrissey's here."""
30:57;30:59;"And he said it like a few times that"
30:59;31:01;"almost felt a little bit just like, ""I see you"
31:01;31:03;"Morrissey."" Definitely not like dissing him,"
31:03;31:05;"but just kind of..."
31:05;31:07;"At some point he's like, ""Alright, I'll shut up about"
31:07;31:09;"Morrissey soon."""
31:09;31:11;"And then he even, you know, he clearly was a Smiths fan."
31:11;31:13;"He dropped a few references. He was like,"
31:13;31:15;"""You know, I had a dream the other night."
31:15;31:17;"I dreamed last night that somebody loved me."""
31:17;31:19;"Just like making kind of"
31:19;31:21;"like deep Smiths references."
31:21;31:23;"Then he was talking about, ""You know, I saw"
31:23;31:25;"Morrissey on stage the other day."" He was just like,"
31:25;31:27;"he kept talking about him. And I felt"
31:27;31:29;"like maybe he was not being aggressive,"
31:29;31:31;"but maybe just like riling"
31:31;31:33;"him up a little bit."
31:33;31:35;"2020, uh, July"
31:35;31:37;"21st, 2020, Boy George"
31:37;31:39;"tweets out, ""I love"
31:39;31:41;"Morrissey. I hate Morrissey."""
31:41;31:43;"Whoa, okay. There you"
31:43;31:45;"go. So Morrissey must just be like a"
31:45;31:47;"big Culture Club fan."
31:47;31:49;"I wonder because... Just like, ""I'm"
31:49;31:51;"gonna go. I'm not gonna like"
31:51;31:53;"be backstage or watching"
31:53;31:55;"from like the side stage. I'm just gonna like"
31:55;31:57;"go and like sit in a box"
31:57;31:59;"at the Hollywood Bowl."""
31:59;32:01;"That's tight."
32:01;32:03;"Yeah, and you never know with Morrissey. He famously is"
32:03;32:05;"very opinionated."
32:05;32:07;"Got like really strong feelings about stuff."
32:07;32:09;"I mean, the Culture Club, the"
32:09;32:11;"singles are undeniable. And of course,"
32:11;32:13;"I got obsessed with Culture Club after"
32:13;32:15;"the show and listening to those songs"
32:15;32:17;"over and over again. You would hope"
32:17;32:19;"that even if Morrissey was a bit"
32:19;32:21;"of a hater, how could you hear"
32:21;32:23;"like, ""Do You Really Wanna Hurt Me?"""
32:23;32:25;"And not recognize that that's just"
32:25;32:27;"like a classic song."
32:27;32:29;"Yeah."
32:33;32:39;"You realize my crimes."
32:39;32:49;"Left me low and still."
32:49;33:01;"I have danced inside your fire."
33:01;33:12;"How can I be real?"
33:12;33:17;"Do you really want to hurt me?"
33:17;33:21;"Do you really want to make me cry?"
33:21;33:26;"Precious kisses were there for me."
33:26;33:31;"Lovers never ask you why."
33:31;33:36;"In my heart the fire's burning."
33:36;33:40;"Choose my color, find a star."
33:40;33:45;"Precious people always tell me."
33:45;33:50;"That's a step I stand too far."
33:50;33:51;"So they are friends."
33:51;33:52;"They are friends."
33:52;33:53;"Clearly they know each other."
33:53;33:56;"But not always."
33:56;33:58;"Boy George, here's Boy George speaking."
33:58;34:03;"And he says, quote, I met Morrissey in 1983."
34:03;34:04;"It was hilarious."
34:04;34:06;"I had tea with him in Paris and he hated me."
34:06;34:07;"He didn't speak."
34:07;34:11;"And so I got really nervous and I just went into verbal overdrive for a whole hour."
34:11;34:12;"The whole hour I was there."
34:12;34:15;"When I left, he said, Boy George is overbearing."
34:15;34:23;"Well, I wish I could be a fly out of wall at that Parisian cafe for that conversation."
34:23;34:25;"I briefly was backstage after the show."
34:25;34:28;"And I had one second with Boy George."
34:28;34:29;"And I was just like, wait."
34:29;34:32;"And I asked him, he actually said that about the meeting in France, because I was like,"
34:32;34:35;"wait, so yeah, so Morrissey there, you guys friends?"
34:35;34:37;"He's like, you know, we've known each other since early days."
34:37;34:39;"We worked with some of the same people."
34:39;34:40;"40 years."
34:40;34:44;"Paris in the early days when we were kind of like blowing up."
34:44;34:46;"And I was like, oh, what was that like?"
34:46;34:48;"And he was like, oh, he was absolutely vile."
34:50;34:54;"And he was, but he was like, I don't give a I love the Smiths."
34:54;34:56;"He had a great attitude."
34:56;34:58;"He was just like so funny about it."
34:58;35:00;"Just kind of like, oh, yeah."
35:00;35:06;"Like, so anyway, that kind of that all tracks with kind of his clearly he was excited that"
35:06;35:11;"he was there and he clearly had a lot of respect for him, but he couldn't help a little bit of"
35:11;35:14;"just like, hey, Morrissey in the crowd."
35:14;35:17;"Just I'm sure Morrissey just didn't want everybody."
35:17;35:21;"And as when I walked past me, kind of a serious look on his face, taking it all in."
35:21;35:23;"But I brought that up."
35:23;35:27;"I couldn't help but think about, yeah, how different things are contextualized."
35:27;35:28;"Berlin plus Culture Club."
35:28;35:29;"And it was fun."
35:29;35:33;"It was a great vibe, but it was, you know, that's like 80s nostalgia fest."
35:33;35:38;"But if I was a promoter, I'd get a Morrissey, Culture Club."
35:38;35:40;"I don't know."
35:40;35:41;"Cure."
35:41;35:41;"Let me ask you this."
35:41;35:45;"Is it unavoidably a nostalgia fest in your eyes?"
35:45;35:52;"If you have bands who are at their apex from all from the same era group together?"
35:52;35:58;"What if Berlin didn't play and was just a Culture Club show and they had is Beirut still a band?"
35:58;36:01;"Like just some band, like some band from a different era."
36:01;36:02;"It's like a culture club."
36:02;36:05;"Or would that not move tickets?"
36:05;36:06;"And that's a great question."
36:06;36:08;"I mean, I guess it's all contextual."
36:08;36:14;"And as Time Crisis starts a promotion company and we start putting together high level tours,"
36:14;36:18;"we have to think about these things because I think Culture Club,"
36:18;36:25;"because Boy George is so iconic with the fashion and he was kind of one of the first of his kind"
36:25;36:31;"and he, you know, talking openly about gender and playing with gender."
36:31;36:35;"You know, I went back and watched all these like interviews with him on like Letterman and stuff."
36:35;36:40;"And, you know, he was like totally on some everybody and he's on Johnny Carson in like 83."
36:40;36:42;"Johnny Carson's like, it's crazy."
36:42;36:45;"Johnny Carson's like, now, now Boy George."
36:45;36:47;"And to Carson's credit, he's like trying to be open-minded."
36:47;36:52;"He's like, now Boy George, I'm from a place that we call the heartland."
36:52;36:53;"I'm from Nebraska."
36:53;36:59;"And, you know, where I come from, if a father came down, he saw his son dressed like you,"
36:59;37:01;"it would be a bit of a problem."
37:01;37:06;"I'm not saying that's right, but that's how it would go down, you know, where I'm from."
37:06;37:07;"You know, what are your parents thinking?"
37:07;37:10;"Boy George is like, my parents love me."
37:10;37:11;"I'm different from them, but they love me."
37:11;37:12;"And, you know, what are you going to do?"
37:12;37:14;"Everybody, everybody's wearing a costume."
37:14;37:18;"He just had all these like good one-liners and Carson is kind of with him."
37:18;37:21;"He's like, no, I, he's like, hey, God bless you."
37:21;37:21;"Kind of, kind of energy."
37:21;37:23;"- Hey, I've been in showbiz a long time."
37:23;37:24;"I've seen it all."
37:24;37:30;"- Yeah, there was a little bit of that, but anyway, I think because Boy George is so iconically 80s,"
37:30;37:33;"they're one of like the great 80s hit makers."
37:33;37:37;"So it's, it's so easy to make like a, get some other people big fat 80s hits."
37:37;37:40;"And that is going to be, you know, you're going to have a good time."
37:40;37:43;"You know, it's going to be, the energy is going to be good."
37:43;37:49;"And maybe there's somebody who's not a huge, like music fan, but who's, who's like, oh yeah,"
37:49;37:55;"that reminds me of like, you know, when I was watching MTV when I was, you know, 12 back then."
37:55;37:59;"They might not know Culture Club Deep Cuts, but they're like, oh yeah."
37:59;38:00;"And well, in Berlin, they did Take My Breath Away."
38:00;38:01;"I don't know."
38:01;38:03;"Maybe they're just going to be kind of psyched about that."
38:03;38:08;"Whereas, I don't know if you wanted to, for either of those bands, I guess,"
38:08;38:13;"if you wanted to like recontextualize Culture Club for like a younger generation,"
38:13;38:18;"maybe you would try to pair them with somebody young because it would like resonate in a way."
38:18;38:23;"Or I don't know, like half the Culture Club set is like dubbed out reggae,"
38:23;38:25;"you know, cause like they obviously did a bunch of reggae."
38:25;38:26;"Like, do you really want to hurt me?"
38:26;38:32;"And there's like a Boy George version, reggae version of that Bread song."
38:32;38:38;"[singing]"
38:38;38:41;"And so there's like all these times they're just kind of like dubbing it out."
38:41;38:45;"And it was like, so I don't know, you could even do some like crazy Culture Club"
38:45;38:49;"tour with like some dance hall artists or something."
38:49;38:51;"You know, it just depends what kind of like vibe you want to put."
38:51;38:54;"But then certain packages are probably going to sell more tickets than others."
38:54;38:58;"Well, I think in Dayton, they kind of like, yeah, went kind of both ways with it."
38:58;39:05;"Getting some icons from the 90s and then getting some younger bands, Kiwi Jr. and Wednesday."
39:05;39:07;"Well, honestly, that sounds like a great mix, actually."
39:07;39:08;"Yeah, it was."
39:08;39:09;"I nailed it."
39:09;39:12;"And I'll just say this to close the loop on the Dayton trip is that,"
39:12;39:18;"cause you know, I don't like it for my guys, just you talking about it like it's a nostalgia tour."
39:18;39:20;"Cause I would say Bill to Spill played a lot of new material."
39:20;39:22;"And it's a GBV."
39:22;39:24;"It was probably like half new material."
39:24;39:28;"No, and I think that sounds like an example of when it's right, it's right."
39:28;39:28;"Yeah."
39:28;39:33;"It's not just like putting a bunch of bands together just because they're from the same era."
39:33;39:34;"That's the cream of the crop."
39:34;39:36;"Dino J and BTS."
39:36;39:37;"That's right."
39:37;39:38;"Yeah."
39:38;39:39;"And that's great that they're playing new material."
39:39;39:42;"I bet that was the perfect crowd to play new material too."
39:42;39:43;"Oh, yeah."
39:43;39:44;"I mean, obviously."
39:44;39:46;"Don't you know what you wanna see?"
39:46;39:50;"Your mind keeps playing tricks on me."
39:50;39:53;"I won't show cause you never know."
39:53;39:56;"Follow your mind, follow your mind."
39:56;40:01;"Why could be more of a story than a dream?"
40:01;40:05;"And be in all that soon again in a dream."
40:05;40:07;"Thought I was done with that kind of fun."
40:07;40:10;"Follow your mind, follow your mind."
40:11;40:15;"Now you know, it's what you know."
40:15;40:16;"Yeah, you know, it's what you know."
40:16;40:20;"Yeah, you know, it's what you know."
40:20;40:29;"I will also say I got some quality time in with friend of the show, Stephen Hyden."
40:29;40:30;"Nice."
40:30;40:32;"Stephen made the trip to Dayton."
40:32;40:38;"He was there with some old college buddies of his and we had a fun hang at a bar before night two."
40:39;40:46;"Now is the same way that probably if you went to like a multi-day fish festival,"
40:46;40:50;"odds are you probably need to take some type of psychedelic,"
40:50;40:55;"assuming you're not on the wagon, you know, because that's the culture."
40:55;41:01;"And maybe even helps you unlock something about yourself and the moment and the community"
41:01;41:04;"at a Guided by Voices multi-day event."
41:04;41:07;"Like you knew it was on the menu that you're getting hammered."
41:07;41:10;"A younger version of myself probably would have gotten hammered."
41:10;41:11;"I did not get hammered."
41:11;41:16;"I will say this in the beautiful Dayton Masonic Hall, which is this ornate"
41:16;41:21;"building from 100 years ago, just a prime example of architecture from another era"
41:21;41:27;"when care and detail and aesthetics were prioritized so highly."
41:27;41:29;"Like Miller Lite maybe had like sponsored the show or something."
41:29;41:32;"That is kind of the unofficial GVB beaker."
41:32;41:37;"There were just these like illuminated Miller Lite signs all over this beautiful ornate."
41:37;41:43;"I just started cracking myself up that for some reason Kid Rock hates Guided by Voices"
41:43;41:49;"and he posts a video of him with just like stacks of Miller Lite and his AR-15 like blah, blah, blah."
41:49;41:53;"And just like, that's what I think about Guided by Voices."
41:53;41:57;"That's what I think of that mid-90s low-file indie rock."
41:57;42:00;"Well, Kid Rock famously hated Radiohead so much that he made a video"
42:00;42:02;"where he used Radiohead toilet paper."
42:02;42:08;"So it's possible he might similarly be like,"
42:08;42:12;"""What is this sh*t man recorded to a f*cking four-track cassette?"
42:12;42:17;"It sounds like sh*t. The lyrics don't make sense. The songs are too short."
42:17;42:20;"Too much material. I'm not into it, man."""
42:20;42:24;"Didn't someone say that Kid Rock was back on drinking Bud Light anyway?"
42:24;42:25;"Oh, I don't know. I haven't heard that."
42:25;42:29;"I think I saw some photo of him crushing a Bud Light."
42:30;42:30;"That's so funny."
42:30;42:33;"Yeah, I mean, I-"
42:33;42:36;"So Kid Rock's like, ""You know what, man? I love what Bud Light's doing."
42:36;42:41;"Reaching out to a diverse community of people."
42:41;42:43;"I actually thought about it more. I'm into that."
42:43;42:50;"I'm gonna get a huge Miller Lite boycott for people who don't like lo-fi guitar music."""
42:50;42:53;"I had a few drinks, but I didn't go ham."
42:53;42:54;"I was also kind of by myself."
42:54;42:58;"Do you know what I mean?"
42:58;43:00;"I hung with Haydn, but then he and his buddies were up."
43:00;43:04;"They had seats, and then they were being hard-asses night two about"
43:04;43:08;"who could go in and out of the general admission area."
43:08;43:11;"So then I was just kind of kicking it solo."
43:11;43:14;"""What am I gonna do? Just get blackout drunk by myself?"""
43:14;43:15;"No need."
43:15;43:18;"And also, Bob's cut way back on the drinking."
43:18;43:23;"So he's mid-60. He's 65. I think he'll turn 66 soon."
43:25;43:29;"There were a couple ceremonial swigs from the tequila bottle from the Jose Cuervo,"
43:29;43:32;"and maybe a Miller Lite or two was downed."
43:32;43:35;"But it was not like it used to be."
43:35;43:37;"And you know what? That's better for everyone."
43:37;43:38;"Right."
43:38;43:42;"It was a fun, weird, solo dad trip."
43:42;43:44;"Love it. And you got some good pictures?"
43:44;43:45;"I got some good pics."
43:45;43:47;"I loved the Ohio farmland."
43:47;43:51;"The Dollar General next to the graveyard."
43:52;43:53;"You just find good stuff."
43:53;43:56;"An old, weird, burned-out Taco Bell sign."
43:56;44:01;"It's just funny, given my interest in my subject matter for my paintings,"
44:01;44:03;"you just drive around and you just see it."
44:03;44:04;"Right, wherever you are."
44:04;44:08;"You're just gonna find a weird, old Taco Bell."
44:08;44:10;"You're gonna find Walmarts."
44:10;44:12;"I didn't really have to search."
44:12;44:13;"I just would kind of drive around."
44:13;44:18;"I'd look on a town that's 30 miles west of Dayton."
44:18;44:20;"That looks interesting for no particular reason."
44:20;44:21;"I'm just looking at the map."
44:21;44:26;"I'll drive out there and then, sure enough, there's all the stuff I'm looking for and more."
44:26;44:29;"So anyway, it was a very fun trip."
44:29;44:30;"But I was excited to come home too."
44:30;44:37;"I'm reading this old interview with Kid Rock about Radiohead for Q Magazine."
44:37;44:41;"Kid Rock says he doesn't understand the appeal of Radiohead."
44:41;44:43;"He says their music does nothing for him."
44:43;44:46;"But he thinks a joint tour with the British man could be fun."
44:46;44:49;"Kid Rock told Q Magazine, quote, ""I don't hate them."
44:49;44:50;"I just don't understand them."
44:50;44:52;"I'm listening to their music and it does nothing for me."
44:52;44:58;"If I have a party on tour, I'm not gonna go grab the Radiohead CD to get the party started."""
44:58;45:00;"Fair enough."
45:00;45:01;"Totally."
45:01;45:03;"The star joked that it might be fun to tour together."
45:03;45:06;"Quote, ""They can go out and be sad."
45:06;45:06;"I'll pick them up."""
45:06;45:08;"Wow."
45:08;45:10;"I think this might be the best era of Kid Rock."
45:10;45:11;"I mean, I like this guy."
45:11;45:13;"Yeah, I think we could have been."
45:13;45:15;"He's gonna bring his ""Don't Be Sad"" voice."
45:15;45:18;"What was the thing you were saying last episode?"
45:18;45:21;"Oh yeah, we were saying that with this new wave of all these country guys"
45:21;45:23;"and they're veering a little more sad."
45:23;45:24;"Yeah."
45:24;45:28;"We got to get a kind of country guy out there who's just like, ""Cheer up, boys."""
45:28;45:29;"I'm sure that guy exists."
45:29;45:31;"Is that Morgan Wallen?"
45:31;45:33;"Yeah, Morgan Wallen."
45:33;45:38;"Morgan Wallen, even with his like, sort of, he does a lot of breakup stuff."
45:38;45:42;"But they're usually all puns of some kind of like, alcohol thing."
45:42;45:46;"You know, like he's really into alcohol puns, especially when it comes to breaking up."
45:46;45:48;"But yeah, he's definitely like a good boy."
45:48;45:49;"Like, ""Cheer up, boys."""
45:49;45:51;"""Hey, I know you had a bad breakup."
45:51;45:53;"Cheer up, boys."""
45:53;45:55;"Radiohead Kid Rock would have been a legendary tour."
45:55;46:00;"But those are the things that I think generally don't tend to work."
46:00;46:04;"Like, it seemingly, like, ""I'm with you, kid."""
46:04;46:05;"That's a great narrative arc."
46:05;46:07;"Radiohead comes out."
46:07;46:10;"It's kind of like, their music is kind of tense."
46:10;46:14;"There's an element of, you know, dystopianism."
46:15;46:16;"Feelings of paranoia."
46:16;46:18;"Cerebral."
46:18;46:19;"You're kind of in your head."
46:19;46:21;"You're feeling stressed out."
46:21;46:30;"But then, as they shuffle off stage, then just this suddenly, you kind of feel your body relax."
46:30;46:34;"And just a warm feeling rises as Kid Rock takes the stage."
46:34;46:37;"And just kind of feel good, rock and roll."
46:37;46:39;"And now you're kind of moving."
46:39;46:42;"Like, seemingly, that would be an excellent one-two punch."
46:42;46:43;"But I don't know."
46:43;46:44;"Maybe promoters are scared of it."
46:45;46:46;"Or maybe Radiohead said no."
46:46;46:48;"Too libidinal."
46:48;46:51;"The Kid Rock comes out."
46:51;46:56;"There's the full libidinal release after the tension and buildup of Radiohead."
46:56;47:00;"Honestly, we should still try to make this happen."
47:00;47:02;"Turns out Tom York's a big fan."
47:02;47:07;"Oh my God."
47:10;47:18;"You stab them knives and try to get some rest"
47:18;47:36;"From all the end on chicken voices in my head"
47:40;47:49;"What's there?"
47:49;47:51;"What's there?"
47:51;48:00;"I did hear Oliver Anthony being blasted out of a car in a Walmart parking lot in Ohio."
48:00;48:02;"And I did feel like a New York Times reporter,"
48:02;48:07;"you know, out there in the bellwether state during election season."
48:07;48:09;"Yeah, Oliver Anthony's hit."
48:09;48:12;"It was specifically Richmond, north of Richmond."
48:12;48:12;"Oh, yeah."
48:12;48:16;"No, I really was a coastal elite in a parking lot in rural Ohio."
48:16;48:24;"And yeah, it was north of Richmond getting just blasted out of like a Toyota Celica."
48:24;48:25;"Wow."
48:25;48:26;"He's just absolutely massive."
48:26;48:35;"I told you I read that thing, some article that said he makes $40,000 a day in the last--"
48:35;48:36;"Oliver Anthony music?"
48:37;48:40;"Based on Richmond, north of Richmond streams."
48:40;48:42;"$40,000 a day."
48:42;48:46;"His next album comes out, just move north of Richmond."
48:46;48:48;"And it's like a picture of him smoking a cigar."
48:48;48:50;"In his--"
48:50;48:52;"Big rocking chair."
48:52;48:52;"Where would he be living?"
48:52;48:55;"He got a big old house in Alexandria, Virginia."
48:55;48:57;"Oh, he's living in the Beltway?"
48:57;48:58;"He's just moving in."
48:58;48:59;"He's now--"
48:59;49:02;"I'm just trying to think when he says north of Richmond, because Richmond is the south."
49:02;49:05;"I think that's what he's basically, Richmond, north of Richmond, I assume."
49:05;49:07;"Yeah, we never even discussed that."
49:07;49:10;"That just means the north, or that means specifically DC?"
49:10;49:12;"I mean, it must mean DC."
49:12;49:13;"I think it means DC."
49:13;49:16;"The way I interpret it is it means DC."
49:16;49:17;"Yeah."
49:17;49:18;"But obviously, it could."
49:18;49:21;"I mean, DC is like the pretty north from Richmond."
49:21;49:22;"I mean, it's like a--"
49:22;49:23;"If I--"
49:23;49:26;"I mean, it's been a year since I drove, but I think it's a two-hour drive."
49:26;49:26;"Let me see."
49:26;49:30;"I don't interpret it as like a north versus south thing."
49:30;49:31;"He just meant DC."
49:31;49:32;"It's the power--"
49:32;49:34;"The powerway insiders."
49:34;49:35;"The powerless."
49:35;49:41;"Nick, where did the rich DC insiders live?"
49:41;49:42;"Where'd you get a big old house?"
49:42;49:44;"Was that in Bethesda, Maryland?"
49:44;49:46;"Chevy Chase?"
49:46;49:50;"Yeah, Chevy Chase, Bethesda, Georgetown in Washington, DC."
49:50;49:51;"I think you would absolutely--"
49:51;49:53;"I mean, Bethesda, Chevy Chase."
49:53;49:54;"Well, yeah, no."
49:54;49:57;"Georgetown's a beautiful neighborhood, but it's these old townhouses."
49:57;49:58;"I'm just thinking for the album cover."
49:58;50:00;"Oh, you want for the album cover?"
50:00;50:03;"By the way, it's a two-hour drive."
50:03;50:04;"So that's exactly what it is."
50:04;50:10;"I just think for his next album, which is basically his ""Finally Rich"" album,"
50:10;50:15;"and every song is about just bought a house north of Richmond,"
50:15;50:19;"maybe it should be coded kind of Maryland vibes."
50:19;50:25;"He's got a big house on the water, like in ""Wedding Crashers."""
50:25;50:28;"The Chesapeake style, like out--"
50:28;50:29;"Yeah."
50:29;50:38;"Yeah, he's sitting on his boat with a big old beautiful 19th century house on the water,"
50:38;50:42;"and the song is like, ""Yeah, I just moved north of Richmond."""
50:42;50:44;"And he's just bragging about how much money he made."
50:44;50:48;"$40,000 a day, just moved to Chesapeake Bay."
50:48;50:49;"They're just featuring little baby."
50:49;50:56;"Maybe actually his crazy arc is that he's the ""Cheer Up Boys"" guy."
50:56;51:02;"After his stirring songs about the broken American dream,"
51:02;51:05;"and living in poverty, and working terrible jobs,"
51:05;51:10;"and then actually, ironically, he proved the American dream."
51:10;51:13;"That America is such a wealthy country."
51:13;51:15;"If you believe in yourself, you start posting videos"
51:15;51:18;"that you sing on the side of a country highway,"
51:18;51:20;"you could be raking in $40,000 a day."
51:20;51:22;"You can move to Chesapeake Bay."
51:22;51:26;"So maybe the next album is really kind of happy."
51:27;51:31;"My life started to spiral the day I went viral."
51:31;51:35;"Yeah, maybe every since, my life was spiraling after I went viraling."
51:35;51:38;"Everybody in Farmville didn't have any chill."
51:38;51:41;"Actually, it's the small town people started getting weird."
51:41;51:44;"And then he moves to greater DC."
51:44;51:47;"He's hanging out with Thomas Friedman."
51:47;51:52;"The Tom Friedman column in the New York Times."
51:52;51:54;"My lunch with Oliver Anthony."
51:55;51:58;"Oliver Anthony buys Jeffrey Epstein's Island."
51:58;52:01;"Yeah, they're like, ""What?"""
52:01;52:02;"You know, always, what happened?"
52:02;52:03;"Remember with MIA?"
52:03;52:05;"I think it was with MIA and that big thing was like,"
52:05;52:07;"what she ordered for lunch."
52:07;52:09;"Do you remember when the New York Times?"
52:09;52:11;"They were trying to take her down because she ordered truffle fries."
52:11;52:15;"Yeah, Oliver Anthony orders some kind of..."
52:15;52:19;"He ordered the $65 lobster roll."
52:19;52:24;"He's having lunch with JD Vance."
52:24;52:27;"(laughing)"
52:27;52:28;"Eating artisanal fudge rounds."
52:28;52:31;"Now, you're not going to believe this,"
52:31;52:33;"but Oliver Anthony had his personal chef"
52:33;52:38;"prepare the world's first $10,000 fudge round."
52:38;52:41;"Now, he's making like a TikTok."
52:41;52:47;"He opened some restaurant that makes these artisanal,"
52:47;52:49;"you know, like deconstructed fudge round."
52:49;52:51;"Powdered gold on them."
52:53;52:54;"Looks like we made it."
52:54;52:56;"Um, sad news."
52:56;52:59;"A couple of weeks ago,"
52:59;53:03;"the iconic Jimmy Buffett passed away on September 1st."
53:03;53:07;"I can't remember how much we've talked Buffett on this show."
53:07;53:09;"Not a whole lot."
53:09;53:10;"Maybe not a whole lot."
53:10;53:12;"And actually, I feel like you're a fan, Jake,"
53:12;53:15;"but I guess as we start, I'm not totally sure."
53:15;53:17;"What's your relationship to Buffett?"
53:17;53:18;"I'm not not a fan."
53:18;53:21;"I just, I haven't heard enough where,"
53:21;53:23;"I mean, I love the song Margaritaville."
53:23;53:24;"Great song."
53:24;53:26;"What I've heard is other songs."
53:26;53:27;"They haven't really grabbed me"
53:27;53:31;"in a way that made me want to like really go deep."
53:31;53:33;"There's so many ways we could tackle,"
53:33;53:35;"you know, his legacy and his life,"
53:35;53:37;"but maybe because this is time crisis,"
53:37;53:39;"we got to just throw in Margaritaville"
53:39;53:41;"and kind of like do a deep dive on that song."
53:41;53:42;"I would love to."
53:42;53:43;"Let's just start there."
53:43;53:46;"Yeah. I mean, I listened to a few others."
53:46;53:48;"I listened to his 1985 greatest hits comp"
53:48;53:51;"and I was, I was feeling it."
53:51;53:52;"That's his best-selling album."
53:52;53:53;"That greatest hits comp."
53:53;53:55;"1977."
53:55;53:58;"This is from 77, right?"
53:58;53:58;"Yeah."
53:58;54:05;"This is..."
54:36;54:53;"Okay. Pause it for a second."
54:53;54:56;"It's not a million miles from the Eagles, really."
54:56;54:58;"Right. Yeah. The Eagles."
54:58;55:00;"That's a good reference."
55:00;55:04;"Kind of like semi-country, not too country."
55:04;55:08;"A kind of sweet sadness."
55:08;55:09;"Right. Observational."
55:09;55:13;"I mean, apparently he had written that song initially as like,"
55:13;55:15;"I gotta assume he was influenced by the Eagles"
55:15;55:17;"because he'd written it apparently as sort of a,"
55:18;55:25;"yeah, like a kind of a wry, critical outlook on the tourists that come into Key West."
55:25;55:27;"Right. And so in terms of his life,"
55:27;55:32;"at this point he was just kind of, he found, he's from Louisiana."
55:32;55:35;"He'd probably been all over the place and he ended up in Key West."
55:35;55:39;"Yeah. And he's like 30 at this point."
55:39;55:42;"He was born December 25th, 46."
55:42;55:44;"So he's, yeah, in 77 he's like 30."
55:44;55:47;"And he released a bunch of records already."
55:47;55:48;"Yeah. So he was doing all right."
55:48;55:52;"This was his first hit, but he'd been, he had a career."
55:52;55:53;"He was doing all right."
55:53;55:56;"He's down in Key West, just hanging out."
55:56;55:59;"I mean, as many people have commented,"
55:59;56:04;"what's interesting about this song being his signature song, his biggest hit,"
56:04;56:07;"and in some ways, one of the most successful songs of all time,"
56:07;56:11;"if you consider that it became a restaurant, kind of created a lifestyle."
56:11;56:12;"Yeah."
56:12;56:17;"In a way that a lot of song, even great songs haven't."
56:17;56:20;"As many people have pointed out, what's unusual about it"
56:20;56:23;"is that at its heart, it's kind of a sad song."
56:23;56:26;"All the details sound great."
56:26;56:30;"Nibbling on sponge cake, watching the sun bake all those tourists covered in oil."
56:30;56:33;"He's just hanging out playing guitar on his front porch swing."
56:33;56:35;"The shrimp are beginning to boil."
56:35;56:36;"It's all good."
56:36;56:39;"But then wasting away again in Margaritaville."
56:39;56:41;"I mean, just obviously wasting away."
56:41;56:41;"Yeah. That's great."
56:41;56:46;"It's a kind of intense way to describe hanging out by the beach."
56:47;56:49;"Yeah. The song takes a turn there for sure."
56:49;56:51;"Searching for my lost shaker of salt."
56:51;56:54;"And then some people claim that there's a woman to blame,"
56:54;56:56;"but I know it's nobody's fault."
56:56;56:59;"But then you're kind of like, well, it's actually very mysterious initially."
56:59;57:01;"Woman to blame for what?"
57:01;57:03;"Is it about alcoholism?"
57:03;57:05;"Is he drinking too much?"
57:05;57:06;"I think he is."
57:06;57:08;"He's wasting away."
57:08;57:08;"You know, it's interesting."
57:08;57:12;"Another song from 1977, a Jake favorite."
57:12;57:14;"I'm sorry, Ezra."
57:14;57:16;"Is this a born, because I thought about it,"
57:16;57:19;"but is this a born in the USA kind of situation"
57:19;57:25;"where the majority of the audience may just not really understand?"
57:25;57:27;"There's an irony in what's being said."
57:27;57:28;"Do you know what I mean?"
57:28;57:34;"You got all these people now going to drink at a Margaritaville at the Cancun airport"
57:34;57:35;"and get wasted on understanding."
57:35;57:39;"Well, but Jimmy Buffett opened those Margaritavilles."
57:39;57:39;"I guess."
57:39;57:40;"No, I understand."
57:40;57:42;"The man sees an opportunity."
57:42;57:43;"I'm just, I get it."
57:43;57:44;"That's what I was saying."
57:44;57:46;"Like initially I was reading about a little bit."
57:46;57:51;"It was like originally intended as sort of like a wry criticism"
57:51;57:56;"of like hedonistic tourist lifestyle,"
57:56;58:01;"just like going somewhere and just getting hammered and just, you know, baking in the sun."
58:01;58:06;"And then I think that it seemed like the song kind of took on a life of its own"
58:06;58:10;"or like the meaning of like, you can't control the meaning of your work, essentially."
58:10;58:13;"And maybe Jimmy just went with the flow of how people interpreted it."
58:13;58:16;"And, you know, maybe, I mean, this is, I'm just speculating, maybe in my head,"
58:16;58:22;"he was writing kind of an eagle, like a cynical eagle song."
58:22;58:28;"But Jimmy's heart and his vibe are too buoyant and generous"
58:28;58:33;"to really kind of do the sort of cynical lion eyes kind of thing."
58:33;58:34;"Well, you know, it's interesting."
58:34;58:41;"A song that came out almost at the exact same time as this is Hotel California."
58:42;58:44;"The album came out a month before this."
58:44;58:48;"Essentially Hotel California and Margaritaville were singles at the same time."
58:48;58:49;"Amazing."
58:49;58:51;"On American radio."
58:51;58:55;"And they both describe a place."
58:55;58:58;"One is Hotel California, one is Margaritaville."
58:58;59:06;"And arguably they both are, they're two songs about, you know, gilded cages."
59:06;59:11;"Obviously California represents the American dream, manifest destiny."
59:11;59:14;"Hollywood, the beautiful people, but the idea."
59:14;59:15;"Locked here."
59:15;59:17;"Yeah, and Hotel California is creepier."
59:17;59:19;"It's a strange, weirder song."
59:19;59:21;"But it's interesting."
59:21;59:27;"They're both about being, they're both playing with these kind of positive signifiers."
59:27;59:30;"Checking into a hotel in California."
59:30;59:31;"Sounds pretty tight."
59:31;59:33;"Turns out you can never leave."
59:33;59:36;"Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice."
59:36;59:37;"Sounds like a party."
59:37;59:41;"Nah, actually we're all prisoners here of our own device."
59:42;59:45;"And yeah, Margaritaville sounds like a pretty tight place."
59:45;59:46;"Well, anyway, let's keep listening."
59:46;59:46;"Let's hear verse two."
59:46;59:50;"I don't know the reason."
59:50;59:54;"Stayed here all season."
59:54;59:55;"Okay, he doesn't know the reason."
59:55;59:56;"He stayed here all season."
59:56;59:59;"Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo."
59:59;01:00:02;"Probably a terrible tattoo."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"Yeah, but he got down there."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"But it's a real beauty."
01:00:05;01:00:09;"Buffett claims that he wrote the song in six minutes."
01:00:10;01:00:13;"Attempting to negatively portray tourists in Key West."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"Right, that's what I'm saying."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"But it actually led to an inkling that it's worth it."
01:00:16;01:00:18;"His tattoo is of a Mexican cutie."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Yeah."
01:00:19;01:00:23;"Wasting weight again in Margaritaville."
01:00:23;01:00:29;"Searching for my lost sugar salt."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"So he was hammered and he got a tattoo."
01:00:32;01:00:33;"Right."
01:00:35;01:00:40;"Some people claim that there's a woman to blame."
01:00:40;01:00:46;"He just picked a Mexican woman from the tattoo book."
01:00:46;01:00:53;"He ruined his relationship and now he's got this non-existent woman tattooed on him."
01:00:53;01:00:57;"Yeah, just like a Betty Boop kind of thing."
01:00:57;01:01:02;"Wait, did you notice that at the end of the last chorus he goes, ""Must be Buffett's fault."""
01:01:02;01:01:03;"Oh."
01:01:04;01:01:07;"So the first one it's nobody's fault."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Well, he changes it a lot."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"I think, yeah, or he said, ""Now I think it could be my fault."""
01:01:11;01:01:14;"No, by the end he knows."
01:01:14;01:01:14;"Right."
01:01:14;01:01:14;"Yeah, yeah."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Yeah, he's ramping it up each chorus."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Yeah, this is a great verse here."
01:01:19;01:01:23;"I blew out my flip-flop."
01:01:23;01:01:24;"Classic."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Stepped on a pop-top."
01:01:26;01:01:32;"Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Cruise on back home."
01:01:36;01:01:42;"But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render"
01:01:42;01:01:47;"that frozen concoction that helps me hang on."
01:01:47;01:01:55;"Wasting away again in Margaritaville."
01:01:55;01:02:02;"Searching for my lost sugar and salt."
01:02:02;01:02:12;"Some people claim that there's a woman to blame."
01:02:12;01:02:18;"But I know it's my own damn fault."
01:02:18;01:02:28;"Yes, and some people claim that there's a woman to blame."
01:02:29;01:02:33;"And I know it's my own damn fault."
01:02:33;01:02:37;"The cheerful, like..."
01:02:37;01:02:43;"When you really get into the headspace of this guy,"
01:02:43;01:02:46;"and then it ends with that really cheerful..."
01:02:46;01:02:53;"It really has a sinister, almost horror movie overtone or something."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"Yeah, actually, the dude's dead."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"That last..."
01:02:56;01:02:56;"It's..."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Are those marimbas?"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Whatever that is, a steel drum or something?"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"[HUMMING]"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Sounds like a marimba on here."
01:03:05;01:03:09;"I was checking out some Live Buffett with the Choral Reefer Band."
01:03:09;01:03:14;"He often had live, he would have a guy playing steel drums."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"Oh, that's tight."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"There is a spookiness to the song."
01:03:16;01:03:20;"I mean, it's interesting, this question about, Nick, you're talking about,"
01:03:20;01:03:24;"is it like a ""Born in the USA"" situation where maybe people are misinterpreting it?"
01:03:24;01:03:28;"But I would say it's even weirder."
01:03:28;01:03:32;"And there's a tweet I saw right when he died that I wanted to share with you guys."
01:03:32;01:03:36;"Somebody named Brandon Wenard."
01:03:36;01:03:37;"He's a..."
01:03:37;01:03:40;"He has something to do with BroBible."
01:03:40;01:03:43;"Oh, I think I follow this guy on Twitter."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"Or he follows me."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"He seems like an interesting guy."
01:03:45;01:03:47;"Yeah."
01:03:47;01:03:50;"He shared a quote from Jimmy Buffett's memoir, ""Pirate Looks at 50."""
01:03:50;01:03:53;"I've actually been looking to get a copy myself."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"It's out of print."
01:03:54;01:03:57;"A hardcover copy is going to run you about $900."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"Wow."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"It's like an out of print art monograph or something."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"Yeah, kind of."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"That's hilarious."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"I'll shell out for Jimmy."
01:04:05;01:04:07;"You can't get that on Kindle?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"You could probably get it for cheaper."
01:04:09;01:04:12;"It didn't seem like you could."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"I got to do some more research."
01:04:13;01:04:16;"But the first edition hardcover is expensive."
01:04:16;01:04:20;"So this is what this guy said."
01:04:20;01:04:23;"""I read Jimmy Buffett's memoir, 'Pirate Looks at 50,' when I was in middle school."
01:04:24;01:04:27;"At that age when you start to get interested in the grown-up world."""
01:04:27;01:04:28;"Tight."
01:04:28;01:04:32;"And he wrote, ""In it, I found a Tao."""
01:04:32;01:04:38;"You know, like T-A-O, like the Chinese philosophy, the Dao Qing, all that kind of stuff."
01:04:38;01:04:39;"""Rest easy, Jimmy."
01:04:39;01:04:41;"You did the son of a b**** called life very right."""
01:04:41;01:04:43;"And so here's a passage that he shared,"
01:04:43;01:04:50;"which I guess he drew a connection between Taoism and the Jimmy way of looking at life."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"This is what Jimmy wrote."
01:04:51;01:04:52;"""What are you going to do with your life?"""
01:04:52;01:04:53;"That's the question."
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Answer, live a pretty interesting one."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"I've been called a lot of things in these 50 years on the good old planet Earth,"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"but the thing I believe I am the most is lucky."
01:05:01;01:05:06;"I have always looked at life as a voyage, mostly wonderful, sometimes frightening."
01:05:06;01:05:10;"In my family and friends, I've discovered treasure more valuable than gold."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"I've seen and done things that I read about as a kid."
01:05:12;01:05:16;"I've dodged many storms and bounced across the bottom on occasion."
01:05:16;01:05:21;"But so far, lady luck and the stars by which I steer have kept me off the rocks."
01:05:21;01:05:26;"I have paid attention when I had to and have made more right texts than wrong ones to end up at this moment."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"With a thousand ports of call behind me and I hope a thousand more to see,"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"my voyage was never a well-conceived plan, nor will it ever be."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"I've made it up as I went along."""
01:05:35;01:05:40;"So it makes a lot of sense that Jimmy Buffett would use a sailing metaphor for life."
01:05:40;01:05:42;"But I mean, he's right."
01:05:42;01:05:47;"Like, you know, my rough understanding of the Tao or Taoism,"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"there's a lot of appreciation for the properties of water."
01:05:51;01:05:56;"And flow, you know, the famous like, be like water idea."
01:05:56;01:06:00;"Build a house out of bricks, make a house of something hard."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"You could be inflexible."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"The wind comes and blows you over."
01:06:04;01:06:05;"You learn how to bend."
01:06:05;01:06:08;"You just go with the breeze."
01:06:08;01:06:11;"The way that, you know, the wind hits the water, the water doesn't crack."
01:06:11;01:06:13;"The waves move."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"They go with the flow."
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Yeah, they go with the way."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"And anyway, so I was like thinking about that."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"I was like, ""Oh, that's interesting."
01:06:20;01:06:25;"This dude found the Tao in Jimmy Buffett's midlife memoir."""
01:06:25;01:06:30;"And so then you think about a song like this, like Margaritaville,"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"where is it really just a sad song?"
01:06:32;01:06:37;"And is it bizarre that it would become a symbol of good times?"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Because that's what Margaritaville is."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"The restaurants, being a parrot head."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"It's about having fun, you know?"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"And then the more I thought about it, I was like, ""You know what?"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"Maybe it all makes sense."""
01:06:47;01:06:50;"Because I bet if you like, if you press Jimmy Buffett on it and you're like,"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"""Did people misunderstand this song?"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"Were you really trying to describe depression or something?"""
01:06:55;01:06:57;"That doesn't feel quite right either."
01:06:57;01:07:00;"He's almost like, ""You know, man, you got to go with the flow."""
01:07:00;01:07:03;"You know, so you got good days in Margaritaville."
01:07:03;01:07:04;"Sometimes it's some bad days."
01:07:04;01:07:09;"I bet he'd probably be like, you know, sometimes heartbreak takes you down to Key West."
01:07:09;01:07:12;"Get hammered, watch the Taurus for a few weeks."
01:07:12;01:07:14;"And then somehow that leads you somewhere else."
01:07:14;01:07:22;"And then you, and maybe actually the positive spin is that this dude drinking so many margaritas"
01:07:22;01:07:28;"to deal with whatever he's been going through, actually led him to some sort of moment of truth."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"You could frame it as a positive thing."
01:07:30;01:07:33;"By the end of this, this dude's kind of looking around and he realized,"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"""It's actually my own damn fault."""
01:07:35;01:07:37;"Like that's kind of the positive spin."
01:07:37;01:07:39;"This guy's miserable in paradise."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"He went down there to escape depression."
01:07:42;01:07:44;"And it's a pretty interesting concept for a song."
01:07:44;01:07:51;"It's one thing to be like, ""Oh man, winter in New York, Chicago, Cleveland, pretty harsh."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"The wind blows right through you."""
01:07:53;01:07:55;"That's a pretty familiar feeling."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"But like Buffett being like, ""Well, then you go down to Key West and you're like, 'Oh, hell yeah.'"""
01:07:59;01:08:01;"But then after a few weeks, you're just getting like,"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"just making margaritas just to get through the day."
01:08:05;01:08:11;"It's actually an even crazier feeling to be kind of depressed and lost in paradise."
01:08:11;01:08:14;"And maybe by the end, he realizes it's his own damn fault."
01:08:14;01:08:19;"And that's actually him coming to terms with some deeper truth of life."
01:08:19;01:08:21;"- I'll take that one step further."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"- Yeah, please."
01:08:22;01:08:27;"- That's where this sort of Dowa Buffett is that he did write this as sort of a knock at"
01:08:27;01:08:32;"these tourists that came and overstayed their welcome and got wasted and didn't return home."
01:08:32;01:08:36;"But as Jake said, the song takes on a life of its own, right?"
01:08:36;01:08:36;"- Yeah."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"- And so Buffett himself, rather than fight that, goes,"
01:08:39;01:08:42;"""Well, that's sort of, maybe that's the universe's hand here."""
01:08:42;01:08:43;"- Absolutely."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"- ""I have to accept this."""
01:08:45;01:08:50;"So even though my sort of artistic and creative intent was to basically say, ""F*ck these guys."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"I hate it. You know what?"
01:08:51;01:08:57;"They took it, they ran with it, and I'm going to open up some restaurants around."
01:08:57;01:08:59;"I'll embrace this way of life."
01:08:59;01:09:02;"And I'll become this guy, even though that isn't where I kind of started from."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"You know, hey man, it's my own damn fault."""
01:09:05;01:09:12;"- Right. This guy looked inward and realized that it's all about what's happening on the inside."
01:09:12;01:09:19;"You know, you can, the human mind can turn hell into heaven, heaven into hell."
01:09:19;01:09:22;"You could turn Margaritaville into..."
01:09:22;01:09:25;"- Let's not say a lesser artist, but a lesser sort of like,"
01:09:25;01:09:27;"and not as enlightened an artist might be like, ""No way."
01:09:27;01:09:31;"I don't like how people have taken this."
01:09:31;01:09:32;"I don't, you know, they misunderstand."""
01:09:32;01:09:34;"But instead he's like, embraces it."
01:09:34;01:09:35;"He goes, ""You know what? Okay."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"That's who I am now."""
01:09:37;01:09:38;"- No, totally."
01:09:38;01:09:43;"And yeah, I'm totally with you because I do think the kind of like,"
01:09:43;01:09:46;"slightly small-minded, like kind of angry, ""What?"
01:09:46;01:09:49;"And now people are drinking margaritas at my show?"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"That came from a dark place in life."""
01:09:51;01:09:56;"I think the Jimmy Buffett way would be more like, ""How beautiful is life?"""
01:09:56;01:10:00;"That when I was in a dark place, I wrote this like, mellow little song,"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"and now I share it with a bunch of people."
01:10:03;01:10:08;"And I guess like the knock-on Parrot Heads and the Jimmy Buffett culture would be like,"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"""Oh, they're hedonistic boomers."""
01:10:10;01:10:11;"Right?"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"I definitely saw a little bit of that when he died."
01:10:13;01:10:17;"People being like, ""Oh man, you know, like rest in peace."""
01:10:17;01:10:22;"But that's just like, Jimmy Buffett got big right when like the dream of the hippies died"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"and people went inward and just wanted to have a good time."
01:10:25;01:10:26;"And we're only looking out for themselves"
01:10:26;01:10:29;"or all the negative things people say about boomers."
01:10:29;01:10:33;"Holding on to all the money, holding on to all the positions in government."
01:10:34;01:10:38;"But obviously, Jimmy Buffett, and I'm sure most of the Parrot Heads,"
01:10:38;01:10:42;"a lot of the people there having a good time when, you know,"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band came through,"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"maybe on a cold day in a cold part of the country."
01:10:48;01:10:53;"They're having a good time because they are trying to just celebrate life."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Those people have lots of problems too."
01:10:54;01:10:59;"They're not all people who necessarily like gave up on helping others."
01:10:59;01:11:02;"You know, they might be people who like Jimmy Buffett had to embrace the"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"totality of existence."
01:11:05;01:11:11;"I mean, to go back to this dude's Tao reference, what is the classic symbol of Taoism?"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"It's the yin yang, man."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Everything is connected, right?"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"You got the black circle and the white half,"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"and you got the white circle and the black half."
01:11:18;01:11:24;"So is it really that weird to imagine that somewhere inside Margaritaville is a bit of"
01:11:24;01:11:29;"sadness and also somewhere inside sadness is a nice cold margarita?"
01:11:29;01:11:30;"You know what I mean?"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"Like it's everything at once."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"It's perfectly balanced in its lyrics."
01:11:35;01:11:39;"Because the way he finishes it with like, ""It's my own damn fault."""
01:11:39;01:11:42;"I mean, like you said, there's like almost like a mellow catharsis."
01:11:42;01:11:47;"He ends on solid footing instead of just being like, ""I'm wasting my time here."""
01:11:47;01:11:47;"Yeah."
01:11:47;01:11:48;"Yeah."
01:11:48;01:11:53;"And actually, so we don't know a lot about the Margaritaville narrator."
01:11:53;01:11:58;"We could assume it's Jimmy Buffett, but let's just say it's its own guy, the Margaritaville man."
01:11:58;01:12:02;"By the time we get to the end of the song, if you asked me to bet, ""Is this guy going to be okay?"""
01:12:02;01:12:05;"I'd say, ""Hell yeah, this guy's going to be okay."""
01:12:05;01:12:06;"Exactly."
01:12:06;01:12:10;"Yeah, I know we're joking about it before, but like, no, this dude's not about to die."
01:12:10;01:12:14;"It'd be like, ""This dude went through like a dark month in Key West,"
01:12:14;01:12:17;"and actually he's going to be telling stories about it,"
01:12:17;01:12:22;"cracking people up, bringing tears to their eyes later in life."
01:12:22;01:12:23;"He's going to be okay."""
01:12:23;01:12:25;"Yeah, that's why it works so well as an anthem."
01:12:25;01:12:29;"Because at the end of the day, he's coming out the other side."
01:12:29;01:12:31;"If it just was hopeless, it wouldn't work as an anthem,"
01:12:31;01:12:34;"and it wouldn't work as the basis for a restaurant chain."
01:12:34;01:12:38;"He threaded the needle perfectly."
01:12:38;01:12:40;"It's why there couldn't be a Hotel California-"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"Exactly."
01:12:42;01:12:45;"-chain of hotels with breweries attached to them."
01:12:45;01:12:49;"Too heady, too lofty, too poetic, too dark."
01:12:49;01:12:53;"Did you guys know that there was a Jimmy Buffett retirement community?"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"I'd heard about that."
01:12:55;01:12:55;"They actually built it?"
01:12:55;01:12:56;"There was actually-"
01:12:56;01:12:57;"It existed?"
01:12:57;01:13:02;"Yeah. No, there was a Nick Palmgarten article in the New Yorker I reread."
01:13:02;01:13:03;"It was from early last year."
01:13:03;01:13:07;"I forget. It's in Florida somewhere. Shocker."
01:13:07;01:13:17;"Yeah, it was basically for people of that age, boomers of that persuasion, who are parent heads."
01:13:17;01:13:22;"I'm assuming you have to be a parent head to have any interest in that."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"That's a pretty wild-"
01:13:24;01:13:31;"In terms of you're a musician, you're living in Key West in the '70s, you write a song, it's a hit."
01:13:31;01:13:38;"In 1985, you open your first Margaritaville restaurant in the place that the song was set."
01:13:38;01:13:39;"That's logical, right?"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"Right."
01:13:40;01:13:41;"Then it starts to take off."
01:13:41;01:13:46;"It's not a giant chain, but I think there's 30-something Margaritavilles"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"in cities around the US."
01:13:48;01:13:51;"I think there's eight or nine Margaritavilles in airports."
01:13:52;01:13:58;"So now your song has gone from the hit in the '70s to an airport bar."
01:13:58;01:13:59;"Yeah."
01:13:59;01:14:05;"And then you're one step further. He skipped the Disney ride and he went straight to"
01:14:05;01:14:10;"retirement community. It's pretty wild. I don't know how heavy the branding is on the"
01:14:10;01:14:14;"retirement community, but I don't know, man."
01:14:14;01:14:16;"Yeah, maybe they don't have to play it too hard."
01:14:17;01:14:22;"Because also the Jimmy Buffett iconography, it's bigger than him."
01:14:22;01:14:23;"It's open."
01:14:23;01:14:23;"Yeah."
01:14:23;01:14:26;"It's people who like the beach and hanging out."
01:14:26;01:14:26;"Yeah."
01:14:26;01:14:32;"So if you want to frame it positively, it's like this song that has a touch of melancholy and a"
01:14:32;01:14:39;"touch of happiness and a touch of heaven and a touch of hell all together. It really spoke to"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"people. It did hit something."
01:14:41;01:14:43;"It's salty and sweet."
01:14:43;01:14:46;"It's salty. Wow. I didn't even think about that."
01:14:46;01:14:53;"The perfect drink. Is a margarita the yin yang of mixed drinks?"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"Yeah, I think so."
01:14:54;01:14:57;"It's definitely my favorite mixed drink."
01:14:57;01:15:03;"Also, I forgot, I saved a few things to talk about from a couple of weeks ago."
01:15:03;01:15:06;"When he died, I took a look over at the Jimmy Buffett Reddit,"
01:15:06;01:15:12;"where of course you had people sharing stories and grieving the loss of a guy who really spoke"
01:15:12;01:15:18;"to them. And I hadn't even thought about this. It's so obvious, but one of there's a post from"
01:15:18;01:15:24;"cosmic surf farmer who said titled the post, a deadhead comes with empathy."
01:15:24;01:15:30;"It's been 28 years since Jerry Garcia passed. And I still listen to his music every day."
01:15:30;01:15:34;"I am the person I am because of the friends I made and the experiences I had around that music."
01:15:34;01:15:37;"Today is your August 9th, 1995."
01:15:37;01:15:42;"I hope you have wonderful memories and that Jimmy Buffett's music will carry you through"
01:15:42;01:15:48;"life like a warm wind. Remember, there's nothing you can hold for very long."
01:15:48;01:15:52;"And I'm sure people remark on this all the time. It just hadn't really crossed my mind."
01:15:52;01:16:01;"I'm like, oh yeah, it's so dead. This kind of mellow figure music that -"
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Papa bear."
01:16:02;01:16:06;"Yeah. A kind of central dad figure that -"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"Guru."
01:16:07;01:16:09;"A guru. And really both of them gurus."
01:16:10;01:16:14;"Because it's not just like, oh yeah, I like the music. With both those artists,"
01:16:14;01:16:23;"there's a deeper feeling of the lyrics, the music, the people, the community taught me how to live."
01:16:23;01:16:29;"And of course there's psycho fans for everything. But this idea that - the idea truly of like a"
01:16:29;01:16:35;"lifestyle. They taught me how to live. That's as good as it gets. Of course, you know,"
01:16:35;01:16:41;"Jerry, Robert Hunter, Jimmy Buffett should be very proud. Their music actually does have a"
01:16:41;01:16:45;"philosophy about how to like deal with life."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"That's rarefied air."
01:16:46;01:16:47;"Yeah."
01:16:47;01:16:50;"Do you want to listen to Cheeseburger in Paradise?"
01:16:50;01:16:51;"All right, let's throw on Cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:16:51;01:16:52;"Or should we move on? Yeah. Okay. Yeah."
01:16:52;01:16:57;"You know, it's such a famous title. And I listened to the song when he died and I realized"
01:16:57;01:17:01;"I had never actually heard the song. I don't know how that's possible."
01:17:01;01:17:05;"I know what you mean. I'm so much more familiar with Margaritaville. I threw it on too."
01:17:05;01:17:08;"I love this story."
01:17:09;01:17:18;"Carnivorous habits, made in nearly 70 days. Losing weight without speed eating sunflower seeds."
01:17:18;01:17:25;"Drinking lots of carrot juice and soaking up rays. But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams."
01:17:25;01:17:32;"Some kind of sensuous treat. Not zucchini, feta, cheese, bulgur, wheat."
01:17:32;01:17:35;"But a big warm bun and a huge chunk of meat."
01:17:36;01:17:39;"Cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:17:39;01:17:43;"Grab out all the vegetables and onion slices."
01:17:43;01:17:48;"Not too particular, not too precise. I'm just a Cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:17:48;01:17:51;"Wait, pause it for a second. One thing I clogged listening to it."
01:17:51;01:17:57;"So yeah, he's a guy, he tried to amend his carnivorous ways, made it nearly 70 days."
01:17:57;01:17:59;"He was trying to go eat healthy, whatever."
01:17:59;01:18:03;"But he keeps thinking about in his dreams, a cheeseburger."
01:18:03;01:18:08;"So far, so good. And then the chorus is Cheeseburger in Paradise, heaven on earth with an onion slice."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Not too particular, not too precise."
01:18:11;01:18:15;"But then the final line, I'm just a Cheeseburger in Paradise."
01:18:15;01:18:16;"That one really threw me for a loop."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"It's like, wait, you're the cheeseburger?"
01:18:18;01:18:19;"Right."
01:18:19;01:18:24;"Cheeseburger in Paradise that symbolically represents you."
01:18:24;01:18:28;"Because so far, it's just about a guy who's kind of craving a burger."
01:18:28;01:18:29;"Right."
01:18:29;01:18:32;"Drinking carrot juice, eating sunflower seeds."
01:18:33;01:18:35;"But now he is a cheeseburger in paradise."
01:18:35;01:18:38;"That threw me for a loop."
01:18:38;01:18:41;"Let's see if we can get to the bottom of it in the rest of the song."
01:19:03;01:19:04;"Oh, so he's the sailor."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"So he's saying times have changed for a sailor."
01:19:20;01:19:22;"Is he a sailor who's like out of America?"
01:19:22;01:19:25;"I think he's a hobbyist gentleman sailor."
01:19:25;01:19:28;"But he just rolled up to like Antigua."
01:19:28;01:19:33;"And now times have changed and he can get a cheeseburger wherever he goes."
01:19:33;01:19:36;"He lives in the time and in the place of plenty."
01:19:36;01:19:36;"Yeah."
01:20:00;01:20:02;"Making the best of every virtue and vice."
01:20:02;01:20:03;"Yep."
01:20:03;01:20:04;"That's that yum yum."
01:20:04;01:20:05;"Yep."
01:20:08;01:20:10;"To be a cheeseburger in paradise."
01:20:16;01:20:18;"This part sounds great."
01:20:18;01:20:19;"Yeah, he keeps saying to be a cheeseburger."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"He could have said to eat a cheeseburger in paradise."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Right."
01:20:35;01:20:36;"Funny ending, by the way."
01:20:36;01:20:39;"I mean, yeah, it kind of just trails off."
01:20:39;01:20:42;"I mean, that's so funny."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"I'm a cheeseburger."
01:20:43;01:20:48;"God, you're singing at the top of your lungs."
01:20:48;01:20:49;"I'm a cheeseburger."
01:20:49;01:20:52;"I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise."
01:20:53;01:20:56;"So he said the song was inspired by a long trip on his first boat."
01:20:56;01:21:02;"We'd run into some very rough weather crossing between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico."
01:21:02;01:21:05;"The ice in our box had melted."
01:21:05;01:21:07;"We were doing the canned food and peanut butter diet."
01:21:07;01:21:10;"The vision of a piping hot cheeseburger kept popping into my mind."
01:21:10;01:21:15;"We limped up the Sir Francis Drake Channel and into Roadtown on the island of Tortola"
01:21:15;01:21:19;"where a brand new marina and bar set on the end of the dock like a mirage."
01:21:19;01:21:22;"We secured the boat, kissed the ground, and headed for the restaurant."
01:21:22;01:21:28;"To our amazement, we were offered a menu that featured an American cheeseburger and pina coladas."
01:21:28;01:21:28;"All right."
01:21:28;01:21:29;"I have a theory."
01:21:29;01:21:31;"Best burger of his life."
01:21:31;01:21:31;"All right."
01:21:31;01:21:32;"Best burger."
01:21:32;01:21:32;"Totally."
01:21:32;01:21:40;"Is that the song, outside of the story you just told, is about a guy who wants a cheeseburger,"
01:21:40;01:21:44;"but the current sort of food fashion is like health food, right?"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"Weight loss, health food, sunflower seeds."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"So and he's been out of port for a while."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"So he wants a cheeseburger."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"He wants this thing that's sort of out of fashion, good old American cheeseburger."
01:21:53;01:21:56;"He is also a cheeseburger."
01:21:56;01:21:57;"Oh, I see."
01:21:57;01:21:58;"He's out of fashion."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"He's out of step with the times."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"You know, I've heard a few songs like this."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"Do you know what I mean?"
01:22:02;01:22:07;"What was one of the songs or two, the brothers, they have that song, the hippie, the-"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"Yeah, Old Hippie."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"Yeah."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"Yeah, Old Hippie."
01:22:10;01:22:12;"Like a song a little bit, you know, he's..."
01:22:12;01:22:15;"So he wants that cheeseburger."
01:22:15;01:22:16;"He's a simple guy."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"He is that cheeseburger."
01:22:17;01:22:17;"He's a simple guy."
01:22:17;01:22:18;"But also you're-"
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Not too precise."
01:22:19;01:22:22;"And he's out of, he's sort of out of step with the times."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"That's a great read, Nick."
01:22:24;01:22:26;"Yeah, that's a great interpretation."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"Here's a slightly weirder one."
01:22:27;01:22:31;"He opens the song, ""I was trying to amend my carnivorous ways."
01:22:31;01:22:33;"Made it nearly 70 days."""
01:22:33;01:22:37;"Maybe some part of him really wrestled with the moral implications of eating meat."
01:22:37;01:22:42;"And he was like, hemming and hawing out how I want to be a good person,"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"but I'm bringing suffering to these cows."
01:22:45;01:22:50;"Oh my God, maybe I got it the only way to live correctly is if you eat sunflower seeds or"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"drinking lots of carrot juice and all this stuff."
01:22:53;01:23:01;"But these messages are being sent to him by the universe saying, ""No, man, you are carnivorous."
01:23:01;01:23:05;"Like that's what you were put on this earth to do is to eat a cheeseburger in paradise."""
01:23:05;01:23:13;"And then he has this weird sense of oneness and he goes, ""I was so worried about eating meat,"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"but then I realized I am meat."
01:23:16;01:23:18;"I'm part of like the great circle of life."
01:23:18;01:23:22;"My ancestors were eaten by lions and bears."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"I honor this cheeseburger."
01:23:24;01:23:27;"I do respect the sacrifice this cow made."
01:23:27;01:23:29;"I would actually call it heaven on earth."
01:23:29;01:23:36;"I praise this amazing American creation and I see myself as another piece of meat in part"
01:23:36;01:23:39;"of this beautiful dance that we call life."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"I ate the cheeseburger in paradise."
01:23:40;01:23:42;"I am the cheeseburger in paradise."""
01:23:42;01:23:43;"You know what I mean?"
01:23:43;01:23:50;"Like he kind of got past that kind of, I don't know, like vegetarian moralism and he got to"
01:23:50;01:23:54;"this kind of like higher level of how he sees himself, which is classic Buffett."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Yeah, I love that."
01:23:56;01:24:04;"Guys, in 2002, Buffett's company, Margaritaville Holdings LLC, licensed the name of the song to"
01:24:04;01:24:09;"OSI Restaurant Partners as the name of the Buffett-themed cheeseburger in paradise restaurant"
01:24:09;01:24:09;"chain."
01:24:10;01:24:14;"His two biggest songs both became restaurant chains."
01:24:14;01:24:16;"Well, this one feels like maybe he's sort of..."
01:24:16;01:24:19;"He's chasing the dragon."
01:24:19;01:24:22;"He's chasing the dragon."
01:24:22;01:24:26;"I think he was just like, oh, this, I mean, you can even tell Margaritaville, the cheeseburger"
01:24:26;01:24:26;"in paradise."
01:24:26;01:24:30;"There's certainly like, he's just like, ""Ooh, I think I could do that again."""
01:24:30;01:24:35;"In 2006, the restaurant had 38 locations in 17 states in the United States and one in"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Sydney, Australia."
01:24:36;01:24:41;"By 2018, only a single restaurant in Secaucus, New Jersey remained."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Oh, it's close to where I grew up."
01:24:43;01:24:48;"See, the problem with that restaurant name is that it's inevitably not going to be in"
01:24:48;01:24:48;"paradise."
01:24:48;01:24:52;"You're going to be pulling into like..."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"It's overpromising from the jump."
01:24:54;01:24:58;"You're on the outskirts of the like power center parking lot."
01:24:58;01:25:04;"You know, you can see the like coals and like the Lowe's building supply across the lot"
01:25:05;01:25:08;"and you're pulling into the parking lot and it's next to the Applebee's and you're like..."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"Paradise."
01:25:09;01:25:10;"I'm sorry."
01:25:10;01:25:11;"I'm not in paradise."
01:25:11;01:25:14;"I mean, if you have Buffett vision, then you are in paradise."
01:25:14;01:25:19;"Well, and that's what's cool about the community is that, you know, what Sartre said, ""Hell"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"is other people, but heaven is other people too."""
01:25:21;01:25:28;"So if I looked around at Applebee's, Chipotle, whatever, and I see cheeseburger in paradise,"
01:25:28;01:25:34;"I don't know if the food's going to be better, but the likelihood that I run into an interesting"
01:25:34;01:25:40;"person who might buy me a drink and maybe hit me with some interesting stories about"
01:25:40;01:25:45;"their time sailing the seven seas is much higher at cheeseburger in paradise."
01:25:45;01:25:52;"And wherever you are, you know, that's a beautiful thing to know that you might meet some interesting"
01:25:52;01:25:55;"people who lived according to the Dow Buffett."
01:25:55;01:25:58;"So I'm choosing the cheeseburger in paradise every time."
01:25:58;01:26:00;"Well, RIP to a legend."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"Yeah."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"It's fun going through his songs."
01:26:02;01:26:08;"We should, maybe we should do a second Buffett episode where we get into-"
01:26:08;01:26:08;"Deeper cuts."
01:26:08;01:26:09;"Yeah."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"Well, and also he has plenty, he has this big hit with Alan Jackson."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"It's ""Five O'Clock Somewhere."""
01:26:14;01:26:14;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:14;01:26:15;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:15;01:26:16;"That's like one of his best known songs."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"So there's plenty more."
01:26:17;01:26:23;"And actually the song, the first Buffett song I ever loved, because Wes Miles' dad, Doug,"
01:26:23;01:26:30;"was playing a Buffett tape in the car when he drove us to a Yankees game, was ""Volcano."""
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Kind of a Calypso song."
01:26:32;01:26:36;"I don't know where I'm gonna go when the volcano blows."
01:26:36;01:26:39;"I remember hearing that being like nine or 10, just being like,"
01:26:39;01:26:41;"""Excuse me, sir, what is this?"""
01:26:41;01:26:42;"Yeah."
01:26:42;01:26:46;"I can see that really hitting hard with a nine-year-old."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Yeah."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"That's awesome."
01:26:48;01:26:52;"I don't know where I'm gonna go when the volcano blows."
01:26:52;01:26:53;"Okay."
01:26:53;01:26:55;"Time for the top five."
01:26:55;01:26:58;"It's time for the top five."
01:26:58;01:27:02;"Five on iTunes."
01:27:03;01:27:08;"This week, we're just gonna do the top five hits of 1970."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Why 1970?"
01:27:10;01:27:13;"That was the year that Jimmy Buffett released his first album."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"All right."
01:27:14;01:27:14;"So here you go."
01:27:14;01:27:19;"This is the milieu into which Jimmy Buffett began his career."
01:27:19;01:27:24;"It would take him seven years to really have a hit, but this is when he got started, 1970."
01:27:24;01:27:30;"The number five song this week in 1970, Bobby Sherman with ""Julie, Do You Love Me?"""
01:27:30;01:27:40;"I don't think I know this."
01:27:40;01:27:40;"Oh."
01:27:40;01:28:10;"I don't know anything about Bobby Sherman."
01:28:10;01:28:21;"I'm getting the sense that this songwriter, Tom Baylor, wrote songs."
01:28:21;01:28:24;"He says he wrote songs for Frank Sinatra."
01:28:24;01:28:29;"Yeah, I guess he was a successful LA-based songwriter."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"""She's Out of My Life,"" Michael Jackson."
01:28:31;01:28:33;"I think that's on ""Off the Wall."""
01:28:33;01:28:35;"Yeah."
01:28:35;01:28:55;"But what's weird is that it's sort of a similar arrangement to what you might hear from the"
01:28:55;01:29:06;"50s, but with different instrumentation, that really plucky bass."
01:29:06;01:29:09;"Here's a little fun tidbit that you'll like about Sherman."
01:29:09;01:29:17;"That Bobby Sherman became a reserve deputy sheriff in 1999 with the San Bernardino"
01:29:17;01:29:19;"County Sheriff's Department."
01:29:19;01:29:19;"Oh, nice."
01:29:19;01:29:22;"I like that."
01:29:22;01:29:26;"He left the public spotlight and became a paramedic and a police officer."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"In 1999?"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"How old was he at that point?"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"Like in his 50s?"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"Or like, that's crazy."
01:29:33;01:29:34;"Yeah, he was in his 50s."
01:29:34;01:29:42;"His first single was called ""Judy, You'll Never Know."""
01:29:42;01:29:45;"So I wonder if he was like, ""I need another hit."""
01:29:45;01:29:48;"And he was like, ""All right, how about we do something in the vein of 'Judy, You'll Never"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Know'?"""
01:29:49;01:29:53;"And then he wrote a song called ""Jody, Check This Out."""
01:29:53;01:29:54;"That one flopped."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"Jamie, what's up?"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Joni, I love you."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"Janet, I'm hungry."
01:29:59;01:30:05;"The number four song this week, Clarence Carter with ""Patches."""
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Oh, I know this song."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"It's about like a..."
01:30:07;01:30:09;"Oh yeah, it's about growing up poor."
01:30:09;01:30:28;"I can't kind of picture either of these songs being played in any situation."
01:30:28;01:30:29;"Yeah, this is a big hit."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"They kind of go together."
01:30:30;01:30:31;"Yeah."
01:30:31;01:30:35;"It won the 1970 Grammy Award for Best Rhythm and Blues Song."
01:30:35;01:30:37;"Well, it paid the bills we made."
01:30:37;01:30:40;"Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground."
01:30:40;01:30:43;"When he tried to get up, life would kick him back down."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"One day, Papa called me to his dining bay."
01:30:46;01:30:52;"Put his hands on my shoulder, then in tears he said, he said, ""Patches, I'm depending on"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"you, son, to pull the family through."
01:30:55;01:31:00;"My son, it's all left up to you."""
01:31:00;01:31:09;"Two days later, Papa passed away and I became a man that day."
01:31:09;01:31:16;"So I told Mama I was going to quit school, but she said that was Daddy's strictest rule."
01:31:16;01:31:21;"So every morning before I went to school, I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too."
01:31:21;01:31:24;"Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on."
01:31:24;01:31:27;"I wanted to leave, just run away from home."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"But I wouldn't remember what my Daddy said."
01:31:30;01:31:37;"But till then I was dying, Daddy said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you, son."""
01:31:37;01:31:39;"I tried to do my best."
01:31:39;01:31:42;"This guy's just, his dad died and he's working his ass off."
01:31:42;01:31:46;"He's got to wake up before school and chop the wood."
01:31:46;01:31:49;"A song about tough rural life."
01:31:49;01:31:53;"Then one day a strong rain came and washed all the crops away."
01:31:54;01:32:00;"And at the age of 13, I thought I was carrying the weight of the whole world on my shoulders."
01:32:00;01:32:03;"And you know, Mama knew what I was going through."
01:32:03;01:32:06;"'Cause every day I had to work the fields."
01:32:06;01:32:09;"'Cause that's the only way we got our meals."
01:32:09;01:32:12;"See, I was the oldest of the family."
01:32:12;01:32:15;"And everybody else depended on me."
01:32:15;01:32:19;"Every night I heard my Mama pray, ""Lord, give him strength to make another day."""
01:32:19;01:32:20;"I love the way he sings."
01:32:20;01:32:22;"Yeah, such an interesting melody."
01:32:22;01:32:27;"""The angels took Mama to a brand new home."
01:32:27;01:32:30;"Lord knows, people, I shedded tears."
01:32:30;01:32:33;"But my daddy's voice kept me through the years."
01:32:33;01:32:36;"Saying, ""Patches, I'm depending on you, son."""
01:32:36;01:32:42;"So the guy who wrote this song, his name was General Johnson."
01:32:42;01:32:45;"And he was the lead singer of Chairman of the Board."
01:32:45;01:32:46;"I love Chairman of the Board."
01:32:46;01:32:49;"Yeah, it's an interesting song."
01:32:49;01:32:51;"No easy answers."
01:32:51;01:32:54;"You know, Patches, he was born into tough circumstances."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"They're just barely hanging on."
01:32:56;01:32:59;"Yeah, and then his dad died, life got harder."
01:32:59;01:33:00;"And it sounds like life always stayed hard."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"But he got through."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"I mean, lyrically, it's like an old country song or something."
01:33:05;01:33:11;"It's like a Merle Haggard song about the family coming to, like, leaving the Dust Bowl"
01:33:11;01:33:13;"and going to California during the Depression."
01:33:13;01:33:16;"Or it's like a song about just basically subsistence living."
01:33:16;01:33:18;"Yeah, there's no big reward or anything."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Just keep on working."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Keep grinding."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"And remember what your dad said."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"""We're dependent on you, Patches."""
01:33:25;01:33:27;"I guess it's also a song about acceptance."
01:33:27;01:33:30;"He was so ragged, people called him Patches."
01:33:30;01:33:34;"And it sounds like the name stuck the rest of his life."
01:33:34;01:33:36;"Dad was kind of like, ""All right, man, you're Patches."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"It is what it is."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"Just do your best."""
01:33:39;01:33:42;"I wondered if this was going to end up being like,"
01:33:42;01:33:45;"""And now nobody calls me Patches anymore."""
01:33:45;01:33:49;"Or, ""Now I provided something for my family."""
01:33:49;01:33:51;"""I just bought my house north of Richmond."""
01:33:51;01:33:52;"Yeah."
01:33:52;01:33:52;"Nope."
01:33:52;01:33:53;"Nope, still Patches."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"I vaguely remember the song."
01:33:55;01:33:59;"Somewhat similar as Dolly Parton, ""Coat of Many Colors."""
01:33:59;01:33:59;"Yes."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"Maybe throw that on."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"Another song about having patchwork clothes."
01:34:03;01:34:07;"""One is only poor, only if they choose to be."""
01:34:07;01:34:09;"""Coat of Many Colors"" came out one year later."
01:34:09;01:34:10;"Maybe she was inspired by Patches."
01:34:35;01:34:36;"Patches."
01:35:46;01:35:48;"The wide-eyed wonder of the kid."
01:35:48;01:35:49;"Yeah."
01:35:49;01:35:50;"Looks at their parents with."
01:35:57;01:35:58;"Wearing the coat."
01:36:00;01:36:00;"To school."
01:36:00;01:36:01;"Uh-oh."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Buffet mindset."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"Yeah."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"It's all about your inner world."
01:37:05;01:37:09;"The saddest part of this song is that when she went to school in this coat,"
01:37:09;01:37:12;"her mama made her out of rags, feeling so excited,"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"and the kids were making fun of her."
01:37:13;01:37:17;"One of the kids who's especially cruel was Patches."
01:37:17;01:37:24;"And it just goes to show how people sometimes project their own insecurity onto other people."
01:37:24;01:37:28;"She was like, ""Patches, I thought if anybody would understand, it'd be you."""
01:37:28;01:37:31;"And he was like, ""No, your coat looks like s***."""
01:37:31;01:37:32;"That's the bitter irony, man."
01:37:32;01:37:36;"I might be kind of ragged, but your whole coat is made..."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"I have a few patches on, but your whole coat is made of patches."
01:37:39;01:37:42;"But my mama sewed these with love, with every stitch."
01:37:42;01:37:46;"I like that the kid in this song seems unperturbed."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"Like, these kids are just like, ""Ha ha, look at your s*** coat."""
01:37:49;01:37:51;"And she's like, ""No, no, no, this is a great coat my mom made."""
01:37:51;01:37:54;"It's like, ""Oh, your mom made it? No, no, you don't understand."
01:37:54;01:37:56;"My mama told me the Bible story about Joseph."""
01:37:56;01:37:59;"And they're just kind of like, ""Oh my God, who cares?"""
01:37:59;01:38:01;"And she's like, ""Whatever, guys."""
01:38:01;01:38:02;"See you tomorrow."
01:38:02;01:38:03;"Rich is a mindset."
01:38:03;01:38:08;"You guys are wearing this factory-made pabulum that's coming off the assembly line."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"You all look the same."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"You're all conformists."
01:38:11;01:38:13;"I'm Dolly Parton."
01:38:13;01:38:13;"That's right."
01:38:13;01:38:16;"One is only poor if they choose to be."
01:38:16;01:38:20;"My mama showed me videos about how to get your grind set right."
01:38:20;01:38:24;"My mama showed me videos about how, by working hard,"
01:38:24;01:38:29;"you can make $50,000 a month through drop shipping."
01:38:29;01:38:33;"So I have a growth mindset."
01:38:33;01:38:37;"My mom loves the YouTube pre-roll ads."
01:38:37;01:38:40;"[Laughter]"
01:38:40;01:38:42;"She shows me all of them."
01:38:42;01:38:46;"As far as I'm concerned, you guys are the poor ones because you don't have a grind set."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"What color is your Bugatti?"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"That's right."
01:38:49;01:38:52;"""In the Bugatti, my mama made for me."""
01:38:52;01:38:55;"Yeah, but truly a beautiful song."
01:38:55;01:38:59;"And I mean, they always talk about the great rural purge,"
01:38:59;01:39:05;"where the Illuminati or whoever got all the rural shows off the air."
01:39:05;01:39:10;"Because there used to be a time where half the shows on TV were something about country living."
01:39:10;01:39:13;"The Waltons, Green Acres, whatever."
01:39:13;01:39:16;"And then apparently they canceled them all one season."
01:39:16;01:39:17;"They call it the rural purge."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Oh, I never heard that."
01:39:18;01:39:18;"Wow."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"Like in the late '70s, early '80s?"
01:39:21;01:39:22;"Let me do a number crunch on that."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"I'm thinking like Dukes of Hazzard and..."
01:39:24;01:39:30;"The rural purge of American television networks was a series of cancellations in the early '70s"
01:39:30;01:39:35;"of still popular rural-themed shows with demographically skewed audiences."
01:39:35;01:39:39;"The majority of which occurred at the end of the 1970-71 television season,"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"exactly when these songs came out."
01:39:41;01:39:45;"In addition to rural-themed shows such as Mayberry RFD,"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"the Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres,"
01:39:48;01:39:51;"the cancellations ended several highly rated variety shows"
01:39:51;01:39:54;"that had been on CBS since the beginning of television broadcast."
01:39:54;01:39:58;"Maybe this is the beginning of just like the two Americas."
01:39:58;01:40:02;"Right, all those affluent suburbanites who are spending the money"
01:40:02;01:40:06;"that the ad sponsors are responding to, they weren't watching Green Acres."
01:40:06;01:40:10;"Gomer Pyle was the first to leave, the first cancellation."
01:40:10;01:40:13;"They say it's Jim Neighbors that left that."
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Also, the Andy Griffith Show."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"All this was mostly happening at CBS."
01:40:18;01:40:22;"CBS aired so many of these rural-themed shows that it gained the nickname,"
01:40:22;01:40:27;"the Country Broadcasting System and the Hillbilly Network."
01:40:28;01:40:32;"You can imagine, because we're a CBS-based, probably New York or LA."
01:40:32;01:40:33;"I'm sure New York."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Yeah, maybe New York."
01:40:34;01:40:39;"You can imagine that probably, yeah, the coastal elites working there,"
01:40:39;01:40:43;"kind of high-status job being one of the big three TV stations at the time."
01:40:43;01:40:46;"But maybe it just didn't jive with their kind of madman lifestyle."
01:40:46;01:40:52;"So it says that there was a bit of a war within CBS about all these shows,"
01:40:52;01:40:57;"and that there was a guy who didn't like the shows, Michael Dan,"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"but he kept them on the air because they had strong ratings."
01:40:59;01:41:06;"And then the incoming president of CBS, Robert Wood, pressured him to cancel the programs."
01:41:06;01:41:09;"But even though he was like, ""Listen, man, I'm not a fan of these."""
01:41:09;01:41:13;"And he said to the boss, ""Just because the people who buy refrigerators"
01:41:13;01:41:17;"are between 26 and 35 and live in Scarsdale,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"you should not beam your programming only at them."""
01:41:19;01:41:21;"And then he was fired."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"Wow, he was kind of a visionary."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"Yeah, maybe a guy was like,"
01:41:24;01:41:26;"""I don't care what kind of numbers you're putting up."
01:41:26;01:41:29;"They're spending more money on the coasts."
01:41:29;01:41:37;"And those rural eyeballs are not worth as much to our sponsors as other eyeballs."""
01:41:37;01:41:38;"And he's like, ""Come on, man."""
01:41:38;01:41:40;"That's so madman, dude."
01:41:40;01:41:44;"Between 26 and 35 in Scarsdale?"
01:41:44;01:41:47;"I mean, look, it's probably the same conversation that was had around Yellowstone,"
01:41:47;01:41:51;"without a doubt, which had a hard time getting made."
01:41:52;01:41:54;"But that's a huge hit, though, right?"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Well, now it's-"
01:41:55;01:41:56;"Yes, it's a huge hit."
01:41:56;01:41:57;"Yeah."
01:41:57;01:41:59;"But it was like, who's going to take a chance?"
01:41:59;01:42:00;"That's what I'm saying."
01:42:00;01:42:01;"It's like, are we going to make this show or not?"
01:42:01;01:42:06;"You know, there's a song, okay, so a guy named country singer Roy Clark"
01:42:06;01:42:10;"wrote a song in response to the rural purge."
01:42:10;01:42:10;"Whoa."
01:42:10;01:42:14;"Called the Lawrence Welk HeHawk Counter-Revolution Polka."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"Which made me throw this on."
01:42:16;01:42:16;"Yeah."
01:42:16;01:42:20;"The phrasing of the revival of the two programs as counter-revolution"
01:42:20;01:42:23;"may be a nod to the revolution will not be televised."
01:42:23;01:42:24;"Hmm."
01:42:28;01:42:31;"We're going through a music revolution"
01:42:31;01:42:35;"The hippies say they'll overcome us all"
01:42:35;01:42:39;"But while they're blowing smoke and air pollution"
01:42:39;01:42:43;"We're hanging on with help from Geritol"
01:42:43;01:42:48;"They're rounding up the squares in California"
01:42:48;01:42:49;"Rounding up the squares."
01:42:49;01:42:52;"They're picking off our heroes in New York"
01:42:52;01:42:56;"But they'll never take away our champagne music"
01:42:56;01:43:00;"As long as Lawrence Welk can pop his cork"
01:43:00;01:43:09;"And they still do the polka in Milwaukee"
01:43:09;01:43:13;"Still do the waltz in Tennessee"
01:43:13;01:43:17;"Still picking bluegrass in Kentucky"
01:43:18;01:43:21;"With old-fashioned country harmony"
01:43:21;01:43:26;"So give me some beer, drink, and music"
01:43:26;01:43:30;"And play that double-eagle march for me"
01:43:30;01:43:34;"For they still do the polka in Milwaukee"
01:43:34;01:43:38;"So let me hear that one or two or three"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"Wow."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Silent majority."
01:43:41;01:43:45;"The big wheels at the network started spinning"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"The verdict was that hee-haw had to go"
01:43:49;01:43:54;"But the city speakers don't believe the polka march"
01:43:54;01:43:59;"And who the heck needs polka march?"
01:43:59;01:44:02;"They canceled all the singing and the picking"
01:44:02;01:44:06;"But the stubborn little donkey wouldn't leave"
01:44:06;01:44:10;"And that little fella's still alive and kicking"
01:44:10;01:44:14;"And hee-haw's laughing up its sleeve"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"Hee-haw!"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"Hee-haw!"
01:44:16;01:44:23;"And they still do the polka in Milwaukee"
01:44:23;01:44:26;"Still do the waltz in Tennessee"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"So this is this crazy part where they go in a three?"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"Yeah."
01:44:30;01:44:32;"Still picking bluegrass in Kentucky"
01:44:32;01:44:36;"With old-fashioned country harmony"
01:44:36;01:44:40;"So give me some beer, drink, and music"
01:44:40;01:44:44;"And let me hear that one or two or three"
01:44:45;01:44:49;"While we swing to that good old country music"
01:44:49;01:44:53;"For hee-haw is good enough for me"
01:44:53;01:44:57;"Yes, hee-haw is good enough for me"
01:44:57;01:45:01;"Wow."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"Ironically, that was a somewhat psychedelic piece of music."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"That is true."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"It was an interesting collage sound effect."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"Like demented circus music."
01:45:09;01:45:13;"That's really interesting, I gotta say."
01:45:13;01:45:14;"I mean, they really call it out."
01:45:14;01:45:17;"Like they're rounding up to squares in California."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"I mean, yeah, I guess it's the culture war has been going on forever."
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Yeah, it's been brewing."
01:45:21;01:45:24;"And you know, there definitely is an element of it that is truly a culture war."
01:45:24;01:45:30;"Like obviously there's so many elements of it that have to do with like deep-set belief systems."
01:45:30;01:45:32;"Which belief system is gonna win?"
01:45:32;01:45:33;"How do you treat people?"
01:45:33;01:45:34;"All that stuff."
01:45:34;01:45:35;"That's very, that's legitimate."
01:45:35;01:45:40;"But there's also another part of it that really is just us versus them."
01:45:40;01:45:42;"Who's gonna be in charge of what's on TV?"
01:45:42;01:45:45;"I guess today, and you can watch, it's less of an issue."
01:45:45;01:45:47;"But back then, it really was like, do I wanna..."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"Who gets to get represented?"
01:45:49;01:45:52;"Yeah, when there's three channels."
01:45:52;01:45:54;"And you know, even back then, obviously there's the racial element."
01:45:54;01:45:56;"But some of it was just between white people too."
01:45:56;01:46:03;"Do I wanna turn on TV and watch everything being about rural life and Southern accents?"
01:46:03;01:46:09;"Or do I wanna watch like a more urbane, kind of Northeastern type show?"
01:46:09;01:46:12;"Or Los Angeles cop show or whatever."
01:46:12;01:46:13;"You know?"
01:46:13;01:46:13;"- Yeah."
01:46:13;01:46:17;"- Back then there was only so many slots available."
01:46:17;01:46:22;"I guess those rich men North of Richmond made their decision."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"- And I bet they were sort of like, also like,"
01:46:24;01:46:28;"I mean, this rural life in America, it's overrepresented on TV."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"We don't need nine shows."
01:46:30;01:46:31;"- Maybe it was."
01:46:31;01:46:32;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:46:32;01:46:33;"Was it overrepresented?"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"Yeah, maybe it was."
01:46:35;01:46:35;"I don't know."
01:46:35;01:46:39;"Was it overrepresented or was it just like New Yorkers"
01:46:39;01:46:41;"being like, ""These just suck."""
01:46:41;01:46:44;"- It kind of reminds me of like the electoral college,"
01:46:44;01:46:48;"how like some small swing states have this like inordinate power,"
01:46:48;01:46:52;"i.e. they're overrepresented in elections."
01:46:52;01:46:53;"- Right."
01:46:53;01:46:57;"- I'm just trying to think, is there anything you can remember watching from this period?"
01:46:57;01:47:00;"I mean, I'll crunch some numbers, but you know what I think of it?"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"They are all like Andy Griffith."
01:47:02;01:47:06;"- When we were kids on Nick and Knight, Green Acres was on constantly."
01:47:06;01:47:14;"A lot of people like roughly my age, like have seen, you know, 50 episodes of Green Acres."
01:47:14;01:47:18;"Although Green Acres was funny because that was about urbane New Yorkers"
01:47:18;01:47:20;"who moved to the country."
01:47:20;01:47:24;"Like I remember the opening credits were about kind of like the wife being like,"
01:47:24;01:47:28;"""Oh, I like shopping at Tiffany's and now here I am like out in the country"
01:47:28;01:47:29;"with a pitchfork kind of thing."""
01:47:29;01:47:33;"- But I mean, literally there is Beverly Hillbillies, I remember well."
01:47:33;01:47:33;"- Yeah."
01:47:33;01:47:34;"- Yeehaw."
01:47:34;01:47:36;"- When Beverly Hillbillies took place."
01:47:36;01:47:38;"- I remember Beverly Hills."
01:47:38;01:47:41;"- So there's something for everybody there."
01:47:41;01:47:45;"Well, anyway, on the airwaves, people were still singing about rural life."
01:47:45;01:47:47;"And I guess the reason I thought of that is that,"
01:47:47;01:47:51;"and maybe that's partially why Oliver Anthony speaks to people."
01:47:51;01:47:57;"It's very rare that anything about rural life makes it to the top of the billboard charts."
01:47:57;01:47:58;"- Right."
01:47:58;01:48:04;"- You know, like International Harvester is so specifically about being a farmer"
01:48:04;01:48:05;"with your machine or whatever."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"That was not going to be a crossover hit."
01:48:07;01:48:14;"And even country songs that do crossover historically have not been too much about rural life."
01:48:14;01:48:18;"They might be about the universal side of stuff, heartbreak."
01:48:18;01:48:18;"- Cheer up, boys."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"- Yeah, and drinking."
01:48:20;01:48:21;"They drink everywhere."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Hearts are broken everywhere."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"But like the real specific rural stuff."
01:48:26;01:48:31;"And you could even have a pretty general song about living in poverty or growing up poor"
01:48:31;01:48:32;"or believing in yourself."
01:48:32;01:48:34;"But these songs are so specific."
01:48:34;01:48:36;"- Like ""Code of Many Colors."""
01:48:36;01:48:40;"I mean, of course, anybody could relate to these songs."
01:48:40;01:48:44;"Anybody, even if you go broad enough, even somebody who grew up with a silver spoon in"
01:48:44;01:48:49;"their mouth could relate to ""Code of Many Colors"" or even ""Patches."""
01:48:49;01:48:52;"- I mean, ""Patches"" is just straight up like sharecropping."
01:48:52;01:48:57;"- Yeah, but it's also about losing a parent at a young age and like, you know,"
01:48:57;01:49:00;"kind of having their voice in your head as like some form of guidance."
01:49:00;01:49:05;"And ""Code of Many Colors"" is also about like that disconnect that everybody has to realize."
01:49:05;01:49:10;"It's like not everybody's going to understand you or like what you believe in."
01:49:10;01:49:12;"All right, let's keep moving."
01:49:12;01:49:17;"Number three song this week in 70, ""CCR."""
01:49:17;01:49:20;"Creedence Clearwater Revival, ""Looking Out My Back Door."""
01:49:20;01:49:20;"- Perfect."
01:49:20;01:49:26;"- ""CCR"" obviously is from San Francisco or whatever, but they were trying to be rural."
01:49:26;01:49:26;"- Yeah."
01:49:26;01:49:27;"- It's funny."
01:49:27;01:49:29;"This is like a very rural top five so far."
01:49:29;01:49:38;"- And even this song in particular is rural."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"He has a back door."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"He's looking out his back door."
01:49:41;01:49:43;"- City boys don't even have a back door."
01:49:43;01:49:43;"- No."
01:49:43;01:49:50;"- ""Thank God I'm a country boy with a back door."""
01:49:50;01:49:54;"- Well, this is like psychedelic rural."
01:49:54;01:49:55;"- Yeah."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"- He's tripping."
01:49:56;01:49:57;"- Right."
01:49:57;01:49:59;"From the album ""Cosmos Factory."""
01:49:59;01:50:00;"- Right."
01:50:00;01:50:01;"Such a good song though."
01:50:01;01:50:03;"Who doesn't love Creedence?"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"- ""This ain't Tupac Owens."""
01:50:04;01:50:09;"- Yeah, you got to be kind of messed up in the heads of that like Creedence."
01:50:09;01:50:13;"- ""Hemorrhians and elephants are playing in the band."""
01:50:13;01:50:17;"- Jake, had you heard this song before the Big Lebowski?"
01:50:17;01:50:18;"- Oh, of course."
01:50:18;01:50:19;"Okay, this is a big song."
01:50:19;01:50:20;"- No, I know it was a big song."
01:50:20;01:50:21;"- They played this on the radio."
01:50:21;01:50:22;"I mean, I knew all the radio stuff."
01:50:22;01:50:25;"- Yeah, but Jake's not listening to the radio in the 70s."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"- No, but I was in the 80s and 90s."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"- Oldies?"
01:50:30;01:50:31;"Classic rock for sure."
01:50:31;01:50:31;"- Yeah."
01:50:31;01:50:35;"- Also, we had that ""Chronicle,"" that, you know, the CCR ""Chronicle,"""
01:50:35;01:50:38;"20 greatest hits, CD or tape or whatever."
01:50:38;01:50:40;"- So many great songs."
01:50:40;01:50:50;"- ""Hemorrhians and elephants are playing in the band."""
01:50:50;01:50:51;"- ""Tambourines and elephants?"""
01:50:51;01:50:52;"- Yeah."
01:50:52;01:50:58;"- ""I had not heard 'Man and Me' by Bob Dylan, but I saw it."""
01:50:58;01:50:59;"- ""Lebowski."""
01:50:59;01:51:00;"- Right."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"- Nor had I heard the Kenny Rogers."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"- That definitely introduced that song to a whole new generation."
01:51:05;01:51:05;"- Yeah."
01:51:05;01:51:12;"- Number two song this week, Edwin Starr with ""War."""
01:51:12;01:51:13;"- Oh, wow."
01:51:13;01:51:13;"Classic."
01:51:13;01:51:23;"- Absolutely nothing."
01:51:23;01:51:44;"- This Springsteen covers this a lot live."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Does he still do it?"
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Does he still do ""War?"""
01:51:46;01:51:47;"- I don't even see it."
01:51:47;01:51:53;"- Bruce is pro-Ukrainian intervention, so he's not doing it anymore."
01:51:53;01:51:54;"- Oh, yeah, that'd be too..."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"This is not a tour to do it on."
01:51:56;01:51:57;"- I'm just kidding."
01:51:57;01:51:58;"I have no idea what Bruce is saying."
01:51:58;01:52:01;"- I mean, he was definitely doing it in the '80s."
01:52:01;01:52:08;"- Good God, y'all."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"- ""War."""
01:52:10;01:52:22;"- ""Absolutely good enough."""
01:52:23;01:52:36;"- Yeah, what is he actually saying on the verses?"
01:52:36;01:52:40;"- ""War has caused unrest within the Komsomol generation."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"Induction, the destruction, who wants to die?"
01:52:43;01:52:45;"War!"
01:52:45;01:52:48;"Good God, y'all."
01:52:48;01:52:50;"What is it good for?"
01:52:50;01:52:53;"Absolutely nothing."""
01:52:53;01:52:54;"- Powerful song."
01:52:54;01:53:00;"I guess ""The Temptations"" recorded a version earlier and then got cold feet about releasing"
01:53:00;01:53:00;"this as single."
01:53:00;01:53:02;"- Right, so then they gave it to Edwin Starr."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"They knew this was a powerful song."
01:53:06;01:53:07;"Someone's got to make it a single."
01:53:07;01:53:12;"- The ""Temptations"" album they were going to release the song was called ""Psychedelic"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"Shack,"" which was pretty funny."
01:53:14;01:53:15;"- Oh, yeah, I know some of that album."
01:53:15;01:53:16;"- ""Cosmos Factory,"" ""Psychedelic Shack."""
01:53:16;01:53:20;"- Yeah, I know some of that ""Temptations,"" ""Psychedelic"" era."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"They have some interesting stuff in that era."
01:53:22;01:53:26;"Number one song, ""Diana Ross,"" ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."""
01:53:26;01:53:27;"- Cool."
01:53:27;01:53:36;"- Isn't the most famous version Marvin Gaye and Tammy Turrell?"
01:53:36;01:53:37;"- I think so."
01:53:37;01:53:39;"- Like, because that had been a hit."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"- ""Ain't no mountain high enough."""
01:53:42;01:53:46;"- Yeah, that's like, you know, '67 was the Marvin Gaye duet hit."
01:53:46;01:53:46;"- Huh."
01:53:46;01:53:53;"- Yeah, this is a totally different."
01:53:53;01:53:55;"- They convinced her to try it again three years later."
01:53:56;01:53:59;"- This part is sick."
01:53:59;01:54:12;"A little mellower, totally different arrangement."
01:54:13;01:54:27;"- A lot of intro in the song."
01:54:27;01:54:40;"- Yeah, a lot."
01:54:41;01:54:46;"- Yeah."
01:54:52;01:54:59;"No matter where you are, no matter how far, just call my name."
01:54:59;01:55:06;"I'll be there in a hurry, on that you can depend and never worry."
01:55:06;01:55:11;"You see, my love is alive."
01:55:11;01:55:18;"It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow."
01:55:19;01:55:31;"So if you feel the need for company, please, my God, let it be me."
01:55:31;01:55:38;"- She doesn't even sing the lyrics to the chorus."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"- I've never noticed that."
01:55:40;01:55:46;"You know, it's funny, I didn't even realize this was the same song as the Marvin Gaye-Tammy Turrells."
01:55:46;01:55:48;"Like, I never consciously put that together."
01:55:49;01:55:52;"- I think they do it at the very end of the song, if I remember."
01:55:52;01:56:00;"- I may not be able to express the depth of the love I feel for you."
01:56:00;01:56:05;"But a writer put it very nicely when he was away."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"- So much talking from a great singer."
01:56:08;01:56:11;"- He sat down and wrote these words."
01:56:11;01:56:16;"No wind, no rain, no rain, no rain."
01:56:16;01:56:21;"Oh, winter's cold, can't stop me, babe."
01:56:21;01:56:27;"Baby, if you're my gold."
01:56:27;01:56:36;"No wind, no rain, can't stop me, babe."
01:56:36;01:56:38;"If you're my gold."
01:56:38;01:56:43;"- So this is 1970."
01:56:44;01:56:48;"I wonder if this was kind of inspired by Isaac Hayes' ""Walk on By."""
01:56:48;01:56:54;"Because it's a similar kind of like, you know, late 60s psychedelic mindset."
01:56:54;01:56:59;"Because, you know, his ""Walk on By"" is this long, intense epic."
01:56:59;01:57:04;"And you know, the original Burt Bacharach song, there's kind of like a similar thing."
01:57:04;01:57:09;"But actually, can you throw on the original Dionne Warwick ""Walk on By"" for a second?"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"And then get the Isaac Hayes cued up."
01:57:10;01:57:19;"- If you see me walking down the street and I start to cry."
01:57:19;01:57:23;"- You know, this is cool, but this is, you know, this is the original ""Walk on By."""
01:57:23;01:57:26;"- Is this like '67 also?"
01:57:26;01:57:30;"- Yeah, with the kind of sweet, that classic like Burt Bacharach."
01:57:30;01:57:30;"- Yeah."
01:57:30;01:57:33;"- Or that's Herb Alpert."
01:57:33;01:57:34;"- Oh, yeah, right."
01:57:34;01:57:39;"Definitely there's emotion, but it's, you know, it's like, it's a small little pop song."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"- Now play the Isaac Hayes."
01:57:40;01:57:54;"And I think this version is like 10 minutes long or something."
01:57:54;01:57:56;"- Is this also 1970?"
01:57:56;01:57:58;"- This is '69. It's a year before."
01:57:58;01:58:03;"So he's like taking this kind of like simple pop song."
01:58:03;01:58:08;"But it's like, I mean, this is one of like, it's a corny word to use,"
01:58:08;01:58:10;"but this is like one of the most epic recordings ever."
01:58:10;01:58:13;"And it's so cool that he like took this short song"
01:58:13;01:58:16;"and then did his like really big, intense version of it."
01:58:16;01:58:18;"- He did his 10 minute ""Walk on By."""
01:58:18;01:58:20;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:58:20;01:58:35;"Yeah, just like taking this pop song and going so deep inside it."
01:58:35;01:58:36;"-"
01:58:36;01:58:58;"Like, even though it's the same song, it almost feels like it's about something different."
01:58:58;01:59:00;"This one's so much like weightier and intense."
01:59:00;01:59:03;"- Yeah, it's that ""Walk on by."""
01:59:03;01:59:03;"- Right."
01:59:04;01:59:05;"-"
01:59:05;01:59:29;"Just like so patient and slow."
01:59:31;01:59:36;"- He's not really giving us the like conclusionary like ""Walk on By"" either."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"- Yeah."
01:59:37;01:59:39;"- He's not giving us that little hook."
01:59:39;01:59:42;"Similar to Diana Ross."
01:59:42;01:59:43;"- Yeah."
01:59:43;01:59:47;"- Now I'm like not sure she ever sings ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."""
01:59:47;01:59:51;"- Yeah, pretty out there interpretation."
01:59:51;01:59:52;"And it went to number one."
01:59:52;01:59:53;"- I wonder what Burt thought."
01:59:53;01:59:55;"- Right. Yeah, it's so different."
01:59:55;01:59:58;"I'm sure he was impressed."
01:59:58;01:59:59;"- Yeah."
02:00:00;02:00:01;"- All right, you get the idea."
02:00:01;02:00:07;"- Anyway, should we go back and see if we get the..."
02:00:07;02:00:11;"- Let's go out on the rest of Diana Ross, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."""
02:00:11;02:00:13;"- I just have to know."
02:00:13;02:00:16;"- Yeah, let's find out. Did she ever sing that chorus?"
02:00:16;02:00:18;"-"
02:00:27;02:00:29;"- Oh, right. It goes into this part."
02:00:29;02:00:33;"- Oh, yeah. There it is."
02:00:33;02:00:34;"-"
02:00:34;02:00:36;"-"
02:00:36;02:00:40;"I guess the words, but this is like a different part."
02:00:40;02:00:40;"- Totally."
02:00:40;02:00:42;"-"
02:00:42;02:00:50;"- There it is."
02:00:50;02:00:54;"- 60s, early 70s. People really wanted to stretch out. Take their time."
02:00:54;02:01:00;"- It's interesting to think about if someone took a popular, I don't know,"
02:01:00;02:01:06;"took a Taylor Swift song or something and tripped it out three years later."
02:01:06;02:01:07;"It took it to number one."
02:01:07;02:01:12;"- Yeah, in some ways, it's the same impulse. It's not that different than"
02:01:12;02:01:16;"Grateful Dead, late 60s, doing a 20-minute love light."
02:01:16;02:01:20;"- Oh, yeah. Or their versions of Buddy Holly songs or something."
02:01:21;02:01:25;"- Yeah, right. Half an hour, not fade away."
02:01:25;02:01:28;"- Yeah, exactly. Not fade away. That's what I'm trying to remember."
02:01:28;02:01:34;"- Yeah, but three years very close together for the same song to be a huge hit for two"
02:01:34;02:01:35;"different artists."
02:01:35;02:01:41;"- Well, it's funny, not having been alive in that era, I feel like I have a pretty good"
02:01:41;02:01:48;"sense of like 1967 and 1970 were really different times in terms of pop culture and music."
02:01:48;02:01:50;"- Three years that rocked the world."
02:01:50;02:01:51;"- Kind of."
02:01:51;02:01:59;"- 2020 to 2023. I mean, arguably a lot happened in those three years, and yet it still doesn't"
02:01:59;02:02:00;"even feel the same."
02:02:00;02:02:04;"- Yeah, yeah. No, a lot happened in those years historically, but not aesthetically."
02:02:04;02:02:05;"- Yeah, not culturally."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"- Yeah."
02:02:06;02:02:12;"- All right. Episode 201. We'll see you guys next time. Goodbye."
02:02:13;02:02:15;"- Time Crisis"
02:02:15;02:02:17;"- With Ezra Koenig"
