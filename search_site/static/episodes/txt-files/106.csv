00:03;00:08;"It's Sunday, three days after the holiday that some people call Thanksgiving."
00:08;00:10;"We don't call it that."
00:10;00:15;"We call it Gratefulsgiving, or Gratefulsgivings, or Gratefulgiving."
00:15;00:23;"Today, to celebrate this joyous event, we're joined in the studio by a plethora of TC family."
00:23;00:25;"You'll find out who they are very soon."
00:25;00:28;"Plus, we pay tribute to Robert Hunter."
00:28;00:32;">> Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;">> Beats."
00:34;00:36;">> One."
00:36;01:05;"[ Music ]"
01:05;01:20;"[ Music ]"
01:20;01:22;">> Time Crisis back once again."
01:22;01:24;"It's Thanksgiving weekend."
01:24;01:27;"So as you might guess, this is a somewhat banked app."
01:27;01:29;"But you know what?"
01:29;01:32;"A banked TC app is still live."
01:32;01:33;"You know what I mean?"
01:33;01:34;">> It's live in spirit."
01:34;01:35;">> Yeah."
01:35;01:41;"I'm sure we've had some variation of this conversation before, but it's like, I don't know, what's a hot TV show now?"
01:41;01:43;">> In early December 2019?"
01:43;01:44;">> Yeah."
01:44;01:45;">> Well, succession's over."
01:45;01:47;"The deuce is over."
01:47;01:48;">> Deuce."
01:48;01:49;">> I know, I'm a one-man."
01:49;01:51;">> One-man deuce junkie."
01:51;01:52;">> Yeah."
01:52;01:59;">> But I'm saying, like, you know, obviously with a show like the deuce, they have to produce it well in advance."
01:59;02:00;">> Yeah."
02:00;02:04;">> So when that deuce drops, it's fresh, it's live, it's the new episode of the deuce."
02:04;02:06;"David Simon, that's who makes it, right?"
02:06;02:07;">> Yeah."
02:07;02:08;">> Or who made it."
02:08;02:10;"Because succession's, like, just in between seasons."
02:10;02:11;">> Right."
02:11;02:12;"Deuce is over."
02:12;02:13;">> The deuce is over."
02:13;02:20;"It's not like David Simon has to get out, it's like, after the previously on the deuce and just like, I hate guys, by the way, this is a banked app."
02:20;02:22;"We shot it about nine months ago."
02:22;02:26;"And anyway, you know, I apologize, it took some time to edit it, get everything together."
02:26;02:28;"But now it's ready."
02:28;02:32;"So here is, with apologies, a banked app of my show, the deuce."
02:32;02:41;"[ Music ]"
02:41;02:43;">> The deuce ends in front of the Olive Garden."
02:43;02:45;"It couldn't be more up my alley."
02:45;02:46;"It jumped forward."
02:46;02:49;">> Yeah, I saw you put that on your Instagram story."
02:49;02:52;">> It made me so happy because it's all about, like, gritty Times Square."
02:52;02:53;">> Yeah."
02:53;02:56;">> And the show is in '72, '78, and then '85 is the final season."
02:56;02:57;">> Yeah."
02:57;03:01;">> And then the last 20 minutes of the final episode is in May of 2019."
03:01;03:03;"And Franco's character is, like, now in his 70s."
03:03;03:04;">> Yeah."
03:04;03:05;">> He's back in New York."
03:05;03:06;"He's living in Florida."
03:06;03:07;"He's back in New York for a wedding."
03:07;03:08;">> It's like the Irishman."
03:08;03:12;">> Staying at, like, a corporate fancy hotel in Times Square."
03:12;03:13;">> Yeah."
03:13;03:17;">> And he's walking around and he's seeing -- he's having these memories, like, of the whole cast of the show that he remembers."
03:17;03:18;">> Yeah."
03:18;03:21;">> And then he sees his brother in front of the Olive Garden."
03:21;03:22;">> And then they go in."
03:22;03:24;">> They have a great meal."
03:24;03:25;">> Literally, when you're here, your family."
03:25;03:26;">> It would be amazing."
03:26;03:29;">> The Deuce, brought to you by Olive Garden."
03:29;03:30;">> Darden Industries."
03:30;03:33;">> Is Darden Industries who owns Olive Garden?"
03:33;03:34;">> The Darden Restaurant Group."
03:34;03:38;">> Is it somebody's last name, Darden, or it's, like, some play on garden?"
03:38;03:42;">> I think it's someone's last name because it is a weird coincidence."
03:42;03:48;">> Maybe they own Dave and Buster's and Olive Garden, so they made a portmanteau, Darden."
03:48;03:50;">> Pretty sure they own Red Lobster, too."
03:50;03:53;">> The R stands for Red Lobster."
03:53;03:55;"Well, I guess I'll check out The Deuce."
03:55;03:58;">> This will be the last time on the show that I rep for The Deuce."
03:58;03:59;">> Well, I like that you're --"
03:59;04:01;">> I'm alone on this."
04:01;04:04;">> You ride hard for some shows that don't get a lot of love."
04:04;04:06;"Well, actually, I have no -- I mean, The Deuce is on HBO."
04:06;04:09;"It's not like we're talking about some really obscure --"
04:09;04:10;">> No one watches it."
04:10;04:16;">> But it's on HBO, and David Simon, a very famous -- for listeners who don't know, he made The Wire, a major show."
04:16;04:18;"Helped herald in the golden age of television."
04:18;04:19;"Is that correct?"
04:19;04:21;">> I think that's fair to say."
04:21;04:22;">> That's what people say."
04:22;04:23;"Hannah's here."
04:23;04:24;">> What's up?"
04:24;04:25;">> Thanks for coming through."
04:25;04:26;">> Family show."
04:26;04:27;">> This is a family show."
04:27;04:28;"I don't know."
04:28;04:30;"The phrase ""grateful garden"" just popped into my head."
04:30;04:31;">> Ooh."
04:31;04:33;">> That's a combination of Grateful Dead and Olive Garden."
04:33;04:34;"Welcome to the Grateful Garden."
04:34;04:36;">> When I had my bat mitzvah --"
04:36;04:37;">> Yeah."
04:37;04:47;">> I took my bat mitzvah money, and I bought stock in Disney and Olive Garden's parent company."
04:47;04:49;">> Darden Restaurant Group."
04:49;04:50;">> It wasn't Darden back then?"
04:50;04:51;">> It wasn't Darden."
04:51;04:54;"It was like General Food --"
04:54;04:55;">> Oh, General Mills."
04:55;04:56;">> It wasn't General Mills."
04:56;04:58;">> Because General Mills started Olive Garden."
04:58;04:59;">> Really?"
04:59;05:00;">> Yeah."
05:00;05:01;"That was not a mom and pop."
05:01;05:02;"Kind of grew organically."
05:02;05:04;">> General Mills, more than just cereal."
05:04;05:06;">> The casual dining industry."
05:06;05:07;"So you bought stock in --"
05:07;05:11;">> In the parent company of the Olive Garden, which I loved."
05:11;05:14;">> Because I'm imagining you had a conversation with your parents."
05:14;05:15;"You were just like, ""You know what?"
05:15;05:20;"This is the first time in my life I'm getting, like, some serious checks from Auntie Pearl,"""
05:20;05:22;"or whatever, and I want to be smart about this."
05:22;05:24;"Your parents are like, ""Hannah, we love it."
05:24;05:25;"That's great."
05:25;05:26;"We thought you were going to blow it at the mall."""
05:26;05:28;"And then you're like, ""I want to invest it."""
05:28;05:29;"And they said, ""Well, what do you want to invest in?"""
05:29;05:32;"And you said, ""Well, the companies that are really speaking to me at this moment."""
05:32;05:33;">> Yes."
05:33;05:34;">> Disney?"
05:34;05:35;">> Yeah."
05:35;05:36;">> Wait."
05:36;05:37;"So what year was your bat mitzvah?"
05:37;05:38;"'99?"
05:38;05:39;"How old are you?"
05:39;05:40;">> I'm 34."
05:40;05:41;">> Right."
05:41;05:42;"We're one year apart."
05:42;05:44;"So my bar mitzvah was 1997."
05:44;05:46;">> Yeah, so I was 98."
05:46;05:47;">> 98?"
05:47;05:48;">> Yeah."
05:48;05:49;">> Olive Garden was doing great then."
05:49;05:50;">> I was in the same group."
05:50;05:51;">> Oh, back then?"
05:51;05:52;"Okay."
05:52;05:56;">> In 1982, Darden opened the first Olive Garden concept in Orlando."
05:56;06:02;"I was just picturing, just like, ""I want to buy Disney."
06:02;06:03;"I want to buy Olive Garden."
06:03;06:05;"I want a short TGI Fridays."""
06:05;06:11;">> So what happened to that stock?"
06:11;06:13;">> I think I still have it."
06:13;06:14;">> We should look into that."
06:14;06:19;">> This is like finding out somebody buried a million dollars in the backyard."
06:19;06:20;">> Right."
06:20;06:26;"I remember my parents were like, ""We talked to our stock guy, and he was very impressed"
06:26;06:27;"with your choices."""
06:27;06:28;">> Oh, nice."
06:28;06:29;">> He thought they were really good moves."
06:29;06:30;">> Growth sector."
06:30;06:33;">> I bet Disney was a bit of a roller coaster since then, but I'm sure it's up now."
06:33;06:34;">> Yeah."
06:34;06:39;">> Because I feel like the late '90s, I vaguely know that in between Michael Eisner and Bob"
06:39;06:42;"Iger, the current head -- actually, I've met him before."
06:42;06:44;"He told me he's listening to TC."
06:44;06:45;">> What?"
06:45;06:46;">> Really?"
06:46;06:47;">> Yeah."
06:47;06:48;"It was very early days."
06:48;06:49;">> There's some weird people listening to our show."
06:49;06:50;">> Tim Cook stopped by."
06:50;06:52;"He wasn't on the show, but he stopped by and said, ""Hi."""
06:52;06:55;"We should have asked him, like, ""Can we just start advertising on this show?"""
06:55;06:57;"I'm sure there's probably some general rules."
06:57;07:00;"Like, Apple, they probably wouldn't like it if we start running ads for their competitors,"
07:00;07:05;"but I feel like because we talk so much about advertising and stuff, maybe we should get"
07:05;07:07;"a little exception to the rule."
07:07;07:11;">> Because I would say to advertisers, we have a very diverse group of listeners."
07:11;07:13;">> Who would you want advertising on the show?"
07:13;07:16;">> I would think it would be cool if we were a step above that kind of junk you always"
07:16;07:17;"hear on podcasts."
07:17;07:18;">> Right."
07:18;07:19;">> Because obviously, we're not a podcast."
07:19;07:21;"We're an Internet radio show."
07:21;07:22;">> Right."
07:22;07:23;">> Stamps.com."
07:23;07:24;">> No."
07:24;07:25;"None of that."
07:25;07:26;">> Yeah, none of that Stamps.com."
07:26;07:27;"What's, like, the --"
07:27;07:28;">> Blue Apron."
07:28;07:29;">> -- websites, Wix?"
07:29;07:30;">> Yeah."
07:30;07:31;">> Squarespace."
07:31;07:32;"None of that."
07:32;07:33;">> Yeah, no Squarespace."
07:33;07:34;"I just want blue chip stuff."
07:34;07:35;"Maybe, like, Olive Garden, just straight up."
07:35;07:36;">> Just doing the live read."
07:36;07:37;">> Yeah."
07:37;07:39;">> Also, I guess they still do this on podcasts."
07:39;07:42;"Maybe -- I don't know if I listen to enough podcasts because I still associate it with,"
07:42;07:45;"like, radio, where, like, Howard Stern takes two minutes and he, like, really makes, like,"
07:45;07:46;"the hard sell."
07:46;07:47;">> Oh, my God."
07:47;07:48;">> Where he's like, no, no, no, hold on."
07:48;07:49;"Here's the thing about Olive Garden."
07:49;07:50;"I actually was there."
07:50;07:52;"I took my family there a week ago."
07:52;07:54;"And, you know, we had a ball."
07:54;07:56;"We had absolutely -- the kids, they had great kids, man."
07:56;07:58;">> My mother-in-law, she loves it."
07:58;07:59;">> She loved it."
07:59;08:00;"And I'm not just saying that."
08:00;08:01;"Like, you know, there's, like --"
08:01;08:02;">> It's been so long."
08:02;08:06;">> Just, like, trying so hard to make it not seem like a regular ad."
08:06;08:08;"Now, listen, I don't have to say this."
08:08;08:09;"Yeah, no, we said we would advertise."
08:09;08:11;"But, no, I enjoyed it."
08:11;08:13;"I don't know if Bob is a regular listener."
08:13;08:17;"We've had some spicy things to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so we didn't say"
08:17;08:18;"anything offensive."
08:18;08:24;"But in between -- I think in the late '90s, early 2000s, there was a real succession drama"
08:24;08:25;"at Disney."
08:25;08:31;"And then under Bob's tenure, the last 15 years or something, obviously he's taken it to the"
08:31;08:34;"stratosphere, buying Lucasfilm, Pixar."
08:34;08:35;"What else did they buy?"
08:35;08:36;"Marvel."
08:36;08:37;">> I'm impressed you know all this."
08:37;08:38;">> Now they got Disney+."
08:38;08:40;"Hey, you might want to take a look at that stock."
08:40;08:41;">> Through the roof."
08:41;08:43;">> Now, Olive Garden, what do you think?"
08:43;08:45;"Flatline?"
08:45;08:50;">> Yeah, I feel like that sort of sector of the casual dining industry was, like, red-hot"
08:50;08:51;"late '90s."
08:51;08:55;">> Yeah, they were opening so many theme restaurants everywhere."
08:55;08:56;">> Yeah."
08:56;09:00;">> Like, late '90s, I would say, like, Olive Garden and, like, Chili's, Applebee's, that"
09:00;09:01;"was, like, their height."
09:01;09:02;"That's my guess."
09:02;09:05;">> And I feel like Olive Garden has more competitors now."
09:05;09:06;">> Tony Romo's."
09:06;09:10;">> Yeah, I guess what I -- you know what's funny is, like, those restaurants haven't"
09:10;09:12;"vanished off the face of the earth."
09:12;09:14;"I feel like I'm constantly seeing them."
09:14;09:18;"There's actually just more diversity within the -- what is it?"
09:18;09:19;"The casual dining space?"
09:19;09:20;">> Yeah."
09:20;09:23;">> I think I referenced on the show where I was talking about our trip to Mexico just"
09:23;09:26;"how many goddamn Buffalo Wild Wings we were seeing everywhere."
09:26;09:27;">> Right."
09:27;09:30;">> And Buffalo Wild Wings is casual dining, a little bit of a sports bar."
09:30;09:33;">> Okay, so we just got a number crunch from Colin."
09:33;09:34;">> Yes, Seinfeld's late."
09:34;09:36;">> Seinfeld's not in the building yet."
09:36;09:41;"In 1998, the Darden stock was $7.15 a share."
09:41;09:43;"Today, it's $111 a share."
09:43;09:44;">> There you go."
09:44;09:48;">> So that is 700% or something."
09:48;09:49;"That's huge."
09:49;09:50;">> I hope I still have it."
09:50;09:52;">> We have to find that."
09:52;09:53;">> Yeah."
09:54;09:59;"Okay, but just promise me, if you guys find this stock, you're not just both going to"
09:59;10:00;"retire."
10:00;10:01;">> No, I'll keep doing the show."
10:01;10:02;">> Keep doing the show."
10:02;10:03;"All right."
10:03;10:04;"That's what I was getting at."
10:04;10:07;"Jake's just like, ""My ship came in."
10:07;10:10;"My lady found her Olive Garden stock."
10:10;10:14;"We're going to start sailing around the Florida Keys, man."
10:14;10:19;"Yeah, I'll call in once -- I might not have good reception out there, man, but I'll call"
10:19;10:22;"in every now and then."""
10:22;10:27;"Just going full Buffett."
10:27;10:29;"Oh, boy."

10:50;11:02;"[ Music ]"
11:03;11:30;"[ Music ]"
11:30;11:34;">> Anyway, this is going to be a fun and loose Thanksgiving episode because it's the"
11:34;11:39;"Sunday after Thanksgiving, and I believe last year we decided to rebrand Thanksgiving as"
11:39;11:41;"Grateful Givings."
11:41;11:42;"I still can't figure out the best --"
11:42;11:45;">> Yeah, it rolls off the tongue."
11:45;11:50;">> I think basically what we said last year was that Thanksgiving is played out, that"
11:50;11:56;"the concept of being thankful doesn't really hit, but grateful is a way hotter word."
11:56;12:00;"The concept of gratitude, people have gratitude journals."
12:00;12:05;"I, you know, especially here in California, people talk about practicing gratitude."
12:05;12:07;"They don't say practicing thankfulness."
12:07;12:12;"And then, of course, you have the American institution, the Grateful Dead, Dead & Co."
12:12;12:15;"I heard they're selling more tickets now than the Dead ever did."
12:15;12:18;"Although, I have a feeling -- I got to double check the person who told me that."
12:18;12:20;"I could imagine they're grossing more."
12:20;12:21;">> Oh, yeah, dollar figures?"
12:21;12:22;"Absolutely."
12:22;12:24;">> Because back in the day, the Dead's probably selling at a stadium."
12:24;12:26;"The tickets were like $3."
12:26;12:27;">> Right."
12:27;12:30;">> Whereas today, it's probably like that VIP --"
12:30;12:32;">> Yeah, like corporate boxes."
12:32;12:34;">> Yeah, like the Bill Walton."
12:34;12:35;"He probably has a pass, but like --"
12:35;12:36;">> Right, no, there's like that 1% --"
12:36;12:41;">> A Bill Walton-esque figure that's just like for $10,000, somebody from the venue picks"
12:41;12:43;"you up at your hotel."
12:43;12:48;"We drive you right in, right onto the field, and, yeah, you don't have to walk to concessions."
12:48;12:49;">> Right."
12:49;12:52;">> But anyway, yeah, the Grateful Dead is popping."
12:52;12:55;"The word gratitude is popping, cafe gratitude."
12:55;12:57;">> Discussed previously on the show."
12:57;13:00;">> And also, you know what's whack about calling this important holiday where you're supposed"
13:00;13:04;"to express a deep feeling called Thanksgiving?"
13:04;13:05;"What is thanks?"
13:05;13:07;"That's something you say without even thinking about it."
13:07;13:09;">> Right, someone's holding the door open for you."
13:09;13:10;">> Yeah."
13:10;13:11;">> Thank you."
13:11;13:12;">> People even say it when they don't mean it."
13:12;13:13;"Oh, thanks."
13:13;13:14;">> Thanks for nothing."
13:14;13:18;">> I could imagine a 13-year-old who didn't have as good a head on their shoulders as"
13:18;13:19;"you, Hannah."
13:19;13:25;"Just, happy birthday, I got you 20 shares of Darden."
13:25;13:28;"Oh, thanks, grandma."
13:28;13:31;"Anyway, thanks is a whack word."
13:31;13:35;"Or it's not a whack, we need it, but thanks is just something that people just say and"
13:35;13:39;"they don't always mean it, whereas gratitude, that's deeper."
13:39;13:42;">> Yeah, if someone's holding the door open for you, I'm so grateful."
13:42;13:43;"Thank you."
13:43;13:45;">> Thanks, grandma, I'm really grateful for."
13:45;13:49;"No, yeah, people say thanks, because thanks is a small word."
13:49;13:54;"I'm not saying that people don't use it earnestly, but anyway, that's why Thanksgiving's an important"
13:54;13:55;"holiday."
13:55;13:59;"And by the way, you know, Thanksgiving, we've talked about a problematic past."
13:59;14:00;">> Sure."
14:00;14:02;">> Pilgrims, colonizers, all that shit."
14:02;14:06;"If we're really trying to focus on what's good about this holiday, which is the idea"
14:06;14:12;"of being grateful to the people and the things that support you, it can't be called Thanksgiving."
14:12;14:13;"Thanks."
14:13;14:16;"That's why it's got to be, okay, well, I don't know exactly."
14:16;14:18;">> Grateful giving, great giving."
14:18;14:19;">> Well, I like grateful."
14:19;14:20;">> Yeah."
14:20;14:22;">> I like that it has grateful, just like the grateful."
14:22;14:25;"The question is, I don't know why I want to say gratesful givings."
14:25;14:27;"I just feel like adding a few S's makes it flow better."
14:27;14:29;"Or just grateful giving."
14:29;14:30;">> I like grateful giving."
14:30;14:37;">> And right on cue, we have another guest for our very special grateful giving episode."
14:37;14:41;"We've got Kyle Field, also known as Little Wings."
14:41;14:43;">> You got it right."
14:43;14:45;"Most people call me Kyle Field, then Little Wings."
14:45;14:48;">> Well, you know, it's funny, maybe just because I was just talking about all the S's"
14:48;14:50;"and stuff, I did get a little bit nervous as I said it."
14:50;14:52;"Like, you know, I know you."
14:52;14:57;"I'm 99% sure it's Kyle Field, but I still, you know, maybe because here we are on the"
14:57;15:00;"radio, I got clammed up and I was like, is it Kyle's Fields?"
15:00;15:01;">> I know."
15:01;15:02;"It's all because of Sally Fields."
15:02;15:03;">> Oh, right."
15:03;15:07;">> I think me and my brother jokingly call each other, brothers call each other Fields."
15:07;15:08;">> Oh."
15:08;15:09;">> As a joke."
15:09;15:10;"What's up, Fields?"
15:10;15:13;">> Fields sounds like more of a last name."
15:13;15:14;">> I know."
15:14;15:16;"I've never looked into the history of the name."
15:16;15:18;">> You know, it's one I think about a lot."
15:18;15:23;"You guys are aware of the university in Baltimore called Johns Hopkins?"
15:23;15:24;">> Heard of it."
15:24;15:25;">> Know it."
15:25;15:26;">> Or Ruth's Chris Steakhouse."
15:26;15:27;">> I know the story about that one."
15:27;15:28;">> I do too."
15:28;15:30;"But I don't know about Johns Hopkins."
15:30;15:34;">> Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is basically there is a guy named Chris had a bunch of steakhouses."
15:34;15:36;"So there's Chris Steakhouse."
15:36;15:38;"And then a woman named Ruth bought it."
15:38;15:40;"So it became Ruth's."
15:40;15:41;"But they didn't want to lose the Chris."
15:41;15:43;"So it actually makes sense."
15:43;15:45;"The Chris Steakhouse belongs to Ruth."
15:45;15:46;">> That's pretty obvious, right?"
15:46;15:48;">> Ruth's Chris Steakhouse."
15:48;15:52;"But I guess one question I have, though, is why wasn't it called Chris's Steakhouse before?"
15:52;15:55;"And then it should be called Ruth's Chris's Steakhouse."
15:55;15:57;">> Just Chris Steakhouse."
15:57;15:59;">> Now in Johns Hopkins, now Seinfeld."
15:59;16:01;"So because in Ruth's, now Seinfeld's here."
16:01;16:03;"Now we got a full Thanksgiving table."
16:03;16:04;">> Full team."
16:04;16:05;">> Phew."
16:05;16:07;">> Because Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, they write R-U-T-S."
16:07;16:09;"Is that how you -- there's always an apostrophe."
16:09;16:11;">> That's correct."
16:11;16:15;">> So with Johns Hopkins University, it's a J-O-H-N apostrophe S."
16:15;16:18;"There's a series of universities called Hopkins Universities."
16:18;16:20;"And then a guy named John bought it."
16:20;16:22;"And it became Johns Hopkins Universities."
16:22;16:24;">> No, it's not Johns Hopkins."
16:24;16:26;">> Are you familiar with Jasper Johns, the artist?"
16:26;16:28;">> Oh, yeah, another one of those weird names."
16:28;16:30;">> I'm wondering if it's just a last name combo thing."
16:30;16:32;"Johns Hopkins."
16:32;16:34;"Like Longstrethfield University."
16:34;16:36;">> That would rule."
16:36;16:39;">> Right, yeah, John -- because John's -- yeah, and there's Glyn Johns, the producer."
16:39;16:41;">> Right."
16:41;16:44;">> Okay, Seinfeld, let's get a number crunch on Johns Hopkins University."
16:44;16:49;">> Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, let's get a number crunch."
16:49;16:52;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000."
16:52;16:57;">> I'm sorry to say that the university was named after a man named Johns."
16:57;17:01;"Johns Hopkins, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist."
17:01;17:03;">> Oh, I hate that."
17:03;17:04;"I hate that."
17:04;17:06;">> You hate to see it?"
17:06;17:08;">> I hate to see it."
17:08;17:10;"Johns -- so his name is Johns."
17:10;17:13;">> It's got a built-in plural into the first name."
17:13;17:15;">> So you said --"
17:15;17:17;">> It's like me, Kyle Field."
17:17;17:19;"But it's like both plurals."
17:19;17:21;">> No, that would be like if you were Kyle."
17:21;17:23;">> I'm both singular."
17:23;17:25;">> If your name was Kyle's."
17:25;17:27;">> You're right."
17:27;17:29;"You're the opposite."
17:29;17:31;">> He's plural, plural."
17:31;17:33;"I'm opposite."
17:33;17:42;">> And I was reminded yesterday because I saw Emmett, who directed the ""This Life"" video, which Kyle stars in, and he said he saw you out in the lineup."
17:42;17:43;"Is that correct?"
17:43;17:44;"Is that how you say it?"
17:44;17:45;">> Yeah."
17:45;17:47;">> What's the lineup mean?"
17:47;17:49;">> Just where the waves line up and the people line up."
17:49;17:52;"I don't know if it's referring to the people or the waves, but it can be called a lineup."
17:52;17:54;">> That's a phrase that would make sense."
17:54;17:56;"You know who I saw in the lineup the other day?"
17:56;17:57;"Johns Hopkins."
17:57;17:58;">> Yeah."
17:58;18:01;"It's like the club, but it's just different."
18:01;18:03;"[ Music ]"
18:07;18:18;"I'm not here to smell your blood If we get along, no matter who you are, I bet you're good"
18:18;18:25;"By now I know you probably think I should have told you everything And explained every thought that I was thinking"
18:25;18:45;"Today, this morning, this evening And if the tune gets too familiar, we split our pants"
18:45;18:55;"I'm not so refusing to dance Weddings, parties, anything"
18:55;19:05;"Something new, something bold Throw in something blue Throw in something cold Stone soup, throw something in the bowl"
19:05;19:11;"Yo, so anyway, Kyle, legendary dude, you and Jake have known each other forever, just to give a little backstory"
19:11;19:17;"We're coming in real hot in the Grateful Giving moment, but just to give everybody some context, you know"
19:17;19:24;"He and Jake have known each other, played music together for years, and then you really brought our little ""This Life"" video to life"
19:24;19:27;"So fun With your great performance, yeah, and we had a fun time"
19:27;19:29;"As Wade As Wade"
19:29;19:31;"As Wade Do you recognize this shirt?"
19:31;19:37;"Yeah I wore it on Friday night because we played a show on Friday night and I didn't realize it was the shirt I wore"
19:37;19:42;"Oh, that's Wade's shirt? This is the Wade shirt, and I was like, washed the kit, wore it again today"
19:42;19:47;"Iconic You know, just like we're in the same outfit, Einstein style, over and over again"
19:47;19:50;"We really know where you are every day"
19:50;19:57;"But anyway, I'm just picturing you out there in the lineup one day, and then a dude pulls up to you, it's Kyle's Fields"
19:57;20:00;"Oh my gosh He's twice as big"
20:00;20:04;"He's a plural version of me He's like the surfer Paul Bunyan"
20:04;20:08;"Actually, I'm sure we'll return to the concept of grateful givings"
20:08;20:11;"Please I guess it's pretty And I was born a day before Thanksgiving"
20:11;20:14;"Oh really? In '72 Oh, happy birthday"
20:14;20:19;"So, makes sense, it's a Thanksgiving episode So you've always felt connected to Thanksgiving"
20:19;20:23;"Yeah, it's a little depressing, always, too To always have your birthday just before?"
20:23;20:29;"Yeah, and just, I feel like people born in the autumn are prone to some sort of depression"
20:29;20:32;"Oh, is that a thing? Or melancholy, I think so"
20:32;20:36;"Well, what's your sign? I'm on the cusp of Scorpio and Sagittarius"
20:36;20:40;"Ooh, yikes Yikes"
20:40;20:44;"For real? Or you're just doing it? No, I don't know about any of this stuff"
20:44;20:49;"But I do know a few people who are like real astrology heads"
20:49;20:52;"And they will just kind of unironically occasionally be like, ""Oh!"""
20:52;20:55;"Whoa, no, totally Yeah, that's a thing"
20:55;20:59;"Babies born in the autumn and winter may face a high risk of depression"
20:59;21:02;"Because pregnant women have more of the stress hormone in the darker months"
21:02;21:07;"Oh Although I guess that would depend on what part of the world you're carried in your mother's womb"
21:07;21:09;"Right Northern hemisphere"
21:09;21:11;"Yeah Alabama"
21:11;21:15;"Right, because you were born in Alabama and then you grew up in California"
21:15;21:17;"Mostly, yeah Yeah, so Grateful Giving"
21:17;21:20;"I just want to put S's in there Alright, should we just--"
21:20;21:24;"Greatful's Givings? Should it be Grateful's Givings?"
21:24;21:28;"We're going the Johns Hopkins route I suppose so"
21:28;21:31;"Okay, this year it's Grateful's Givings For now, let's spike it there"
21:31;21:34;"Yeah We can circle back, as they say"
21:34;21:37;"Happy Grateful's Givings I think it should be Grateful's Giving"
21:37;21:40;"Greatful's Giving Yeah, I don't think you need the second S"
21:40;21:42;"Grateful's Giving Workshopped"
21:42;21:45;"Right, because it's Thanksgiving, so it's Grateful's Giving"
21:45;21:47;"Okay Feel great about it"
21:47;21:50;"Unfortunately, this is airing a few days after Thanksgiving"
21:50;21:55;"But I just hope that everybody, if you're still at say your parents' house"
21:55;21:58;"You're still spending time with family, just retroactively just talk to everybody"
21:58;22:00;"And say like, this weekend it's Grateful's Giving"
22:00;22:03;"Well, if they're still at their parents' house three days after Thanksgiving"
22:03;22:06;"They're going to need something to do, like listen to a podcast or"
22:06;22:09;"Yeah, exactly I gotta go do this thing, not bad"
22:09;22:12;"I'm pretty worn out You and your cool--"
22:12;22:15;"Pretty worn out You and your cool cousin"
22:15;22:17;"This is a classic Thanksgiving thing"
22:17;22:20;"That you and your cool cousin go to the woodshed, smoke a little wheat"
22:20;22:24;"And throw on that week's TC For sure"
22:24;22:26;"Talk to Ted, as my uncle used to say"
22:26;22:29;"Because that was his uncle that lived next door"
22:29;22:32;"I'm going to go talk to Ted, and then he would sneak off"
22:32;22:36;"That was his escape sentence to go get high"
22:36;22:37;"To get, toke a little Yeah"
22:37;22:40;"During the family function Yeah, and then so he just would say that"
22:40;22:43;"For the rest of his life, like, you want to go talk to Ted?"
22:43;22:46;"Like, wherever we were"
22:47;22:49;"I smoke two joints in the morning"
22:49;22:52;"I smoke two joints at night"
22:52;22:54;"I smoke two joints in the afternoon"
22:54;22:57;"It makes me feel alright"
22:57;22:59;"I smoke two joints in time of peace"
22:59;23:02;"And two in time of war"
23:02;23:04;"I smoke two joints because I smoke two joints"
23:04;23:06;"And then I smoke two more"
23:06;23:10;"Do you feel like when your birthday hits in November"
23:10;23:14;"A couple days before Thanksgiving that you experience a touch of melancholy most years?"
23:14;23:19;"Sort of, but I also, I like my birthday day a lot"
23:19;23:23;"And sometimes I like to almost have as little go on as possible"
23:23;23:26;"Where you're just like observing the atmosphere"
23:26;23:28;"If you want to get all hocus pocus-y like"
23:28;23:30;"This is exactly the day that I was born"
23:30;23:33;"Like this many years ago"
23:33;23:37;"And get kind of sentimental about it or something"
23:37;23:39;"But it can be a little melancholic"
23:39;23:41;"I think a lot of people feel that way on their birthday"
23:41;23:43;"Right, not just fall birthdays"
23:43;23:45;"Yeah, when you're closer to the grave"
23:45;23:48;"What did I not get done this past year?"
23:48;23:49;"Yeah"
23:49;23:52;"And Kyle, your birthday is also the anniversary of the JFK assassination"
23:52;23:53;"That is true"
23:53;23:56;"Which, you know, back in 2013 when they were like"
23:56;23:59;"Today is the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination"
23:59;24:00;"Were you just like, ""Ugh!"""
24:00;24:02;"I bought the Life magazine or whatever"
24:02;24:03;"Really?"
24:03;24:05;"Yeah, they reissued it"
24:05;24:08;"And I saw it at the grocery store and I was like, ""I'm getting that one"""
24:08;24:10;"For some reason"
24:10;24:12;"JFK died in November, huh?"
24:12;24:14;"Yeah, November 22, 1963"
24:14;24:16;"So nine years before"
24:16;24:18;"It's weird that you're only..."
24:18;24:20;"That's crazy you're born only nine years after that"
24:20;24:22;"I'm pretty old"
24:22;24:24;"Well, I was born... Sorry, I was born"
24:24;24:27;"I was born 18 years to the day after the music died"
24:27;24:30;"February 3, '59"
24:30;24:31;"Wow"
24:31;24:34;"So you and I kind of share that cosmic connection of..."
24:34;24:35;"Wait, you said '59?"
24:35;24:37;"Yeah, I was born in '77"
24:37;24:40;"So I was born 18 years to the day after the music died"
24:40;24:41;"Got it"
24:41;24:42;"I share that"
24:42;24:44;"Five years apart, we have like a..."
24:44;24:45;"Yeah"
24:45;24:46;"Profound date"
24:46;24:48;"Just like there's kids now, his birthday is 9/11"
24:48;24:49;"That's true"
24:49;24:50;"Although if you're born..."
24:50;24:53;"Like, let's say you were born 2019 on 9/11"
24:53;24:55;"Just picture it's like you're growing up"
24:55;24:57;"Ten years from now, it's like your tenth birthday"
24:57;24:59;"You're at school"
24:59;25:00;"I don't think your classmates are gonna be like"
25:00;25:05;"""Oh my god, you're born on 9/11? So ew, weird, creepy"""
25:05;25:08;"It'd be like one of us being born on Buddy Holly's birthday"
25:08;25:09;"Right"
25:09;25:10;"To your classmates"
25:10;25:12;"It'd be like being born on Pearl Harbor Day"
25:12;25:13;"Right"
25:13;25:14;"But like in the early 60s"
25:14;25:15;"Yeah"
25:15;25:17;"You know, you'd be aware of it, for sure"
25:17;25:19;"I'd like to talk about November a little bit"
25:19;25:22;"I think you've opened up an interesting topic conversation here"
25:22;25:24;"Today's actually the first day of December"
25:24;25:27;"But it's a good time to reflect on the month we just had"
25:27;25:29;"The month in review"
25:29;25:31;"Time crisis"
25:31;25:33;"Time crisis, the month in review"
25:33;25:36;"'Cause as you were talking about the various feelings you have"
25:36;25:38;"Around your birthday and Thanksgiving"
25:38;25:42;"I think it's the fact that autumn has a very good reputation as a season"
25:42;25:46;"You know, compared to like the really dark days of winter"
25:46;25:49;"Winter gets kind of a bad rep 'cause after Christmas"
25:49;25:51;"People can find it really dark and depressing"
25:51;25:54;"Whereas autumn, it can be charming"
25:54;25:56;"Especially in New York, people love autumn in New York"
25:56;25:58;"And even though there's a touch of melancholy"
25:58;26:00;"That's usually as far as it goes"
26:00;26:02;"In terms of its description"
26:02;26:04;"Of course you can be depressed in any season"
26:04;26:07;"Autumn is kind of a charming bit of melancholy"
26:07;26:09;"I think our hearts probably get opened up"
26:09;26:11;"So to speak, a little bit more"
26:11;26:13;"'Cause there's also like two major holidays"
26:13;26:15;"And then once after New Year's"
26:15;26:17;"You're just like Valentine's Day"
26:17;26:20;"Which can be great for some"
26:20;26:23;"And then others, you just realize how alone you are"
26:23;26:26;"And then you have Easter, which is like in May"
26:26;26:29;"So the winter is really barren of celebration"
26:29;26:31;"I'm sure I've said this on the show before"
26:31;26:34;"I always used to think that March was the worst month"
26:34;26:37;"Because, especially where I grew up in New Jersey"
26:37;26:39;"And then, you know, times in my life"
26:39;26:41;"When I lived in New York City, it didn't hit quite as hard"
26:41;26:43;"But March in the suburbs"
26:43;26:45;"I just kind of feel like a lot of just like"
26:45;26:47;"Like a slate-gray sky"
26:47;26:49;"But not in like a vibey way"
26:49;26:51;"It's like a slate-gray sky"
26:51;26:54;"I feel like sometimes the sky was kind of like yellow, too"
26:54;26:56;"Barren trees, slush everywhere"
26:56;26:59;"And just like weirdly cold, like annoyingly cold"
26:59;27:01;"Not like, ""Ooo, gotta bundle up"""
27:01;27:03;"Just like, ""Oh, f***, it's still this cold?"""
27:03;27:05;"And then also in school"
27:05;27:07;"I don't know if this was across the board"
27:07;27:09;"At East Coast Public Schools, but"
27:09;27:12;"In February we got a nice week off for some reason"
27:12;27:14;"And then in April we got a nice week off"
27:14;27:16;"And then March, I just remember like, you know"
27:16;27:19;"You get like the school calendar, like a photocopy of it"
27:19;27:21;"And you just be like staring at it"
27:21;27:23;"And just be like, ""Gotta brace myself for March"""
27:23;27:25;"""That s*** just does not let up"""
27:25;27:26;"""Just no days off"""
27:26;27:27;"Brutal"
27:27;27:29;"Yeah, so March always struck me as a brutal month"
27:29;27:31;"But then now I'm interested in November because"
27:31;27:33;"I think as far as the end of the year goes"
27:33;27:35;"We're talking about Q4"
27:35;27:38;"I'm kind of a businessman, so I don't dwell too much on seasons"
27:38;27:40;"I'm more of a Q guy"
27:40;27:42;"So when we're talking about Q4"
27:42;27:45;"We got October, November, and December"
27:45;27:47;"November kind of has the middle child syndrome"
27:47;27:49;"As far as Q4 goes"
27:49;27:51;"And then of course, nothing lasts forever"
27:51;27:53;"Even cold November rain"
27:53;27:55;"'Cause October, vibey as hell"
27:55;27:57;"I love October, right?"
27:57;27:59;"The leaves are popping"
27:59;28:01;"Upstate New York, Vermont"
28:01;28:03;"Absolutely gorgeous"
28:03;28:05;"And people are peeping the leaves"
28:05;28:06;"Leaf peeping"
28:06;28:07;"Oh yeah"
28:07;28:08;"I just learned that one this year"
28:08;28:10;"Do some leaf peeping"
28:10;28:12;"On the east coast"
28:12;28:14;"Like driving around looking at the foliage"
28:14;28:16;"Yeah, but that's what they call it"
28:16;28:17;"Wow, I haven't heard that term"
28:17;28:18;"Maybe it's new"
28:18;28:19;"Leaf peeping"
28:19;28:20;"We did that"
28:20;28:21;"But did you call it leaf peeping?"
28:21;28:22;"Yeah"
28:22;28:23;"Your dad said, ""Let's go leaf peeping"""
28:23;28:24;"No, he never said that"
28:24;28:26;"But it was a term that was thrown around"
28:26;28:27;"Okay"
28:27;28:28;"Where did you mostly grow up, Hannah?"
28:28;28:29;"Connecticut?"
28:29;28:30;"D.C."
28:30;28:31;"Why do I always think of Connecticut?"
28:31;28:32;"My parents live there now"
28:32;28:34;"So there's a real CT connection"
28:34;28:35;"And then you went to school in Indiana"
28:35;28:37;"You've been all over this great nation"
28:37;28:38;"Oh yeah"
28:38;28:40;"But yeah, east coast fall is gorgeous"
28:40;28:42;"Seinfeld up there in Canada"
28:42;28:43;"And we actually in Canada"
28:43;28:44;"We have March break"
28:44;28:46;"We get two weeks off"
28:46;28:48;"Or one week off in the middle of March"
28:48;28:50;"So there was like a nice oasis"
28:50;28:52;"Of like vacation to look forward to"
28:52;28:54;"Canada's got so many things figured out"
28:54;28:56;"Yeah, we were never peeping"
28:56;28:58;"Why is it that if only"
28:58;29:02;"Of all the major nations in North America"
29:02;29:05;"The U.S. has the most brutal March?"
29:05;29:07;"I could take you right across the border to Canada"
29:07;29:09;"Where they have a nice fat break"
29:09;29:12;"Um, in October that must be like"
29:12;29:15;"Yeah, there's beautiful trees up in Quebec, right?"
29:15;29:17;"Yeah, yeah"
29:17;29:19;"Definitely we experience the slush"
29:19;29:21;"And also like not to get too graphic"
29:21;29:23;"But like in March"
29:23;29:25;"That's when everything starts to melt"
29:25;29:28;"And so all like the dog excrement and stuff"
29:28;29:30;"Starts to, do you know about this phenomenon?"
29:30;29:31;"Oh, sure"
29:31;29:32;"The hidden sh*t"
29:32;29:35;"All the hidden sh*t starts to sort of rear its head"
29:35;29:36;"Yeah, and then you hear it"
29:36;29:38;"And deer carcasses and stuff"
29:38;29:40;"Dead bodies"
29:40;29:42;"All the human bodies"
29:42;29:44;"All the Laura Palmers"
29:44;29:47;"I witnessed fall happen"
29:47;29:49;"When I was up in Calgary"
29:49;29:52;"And it was three days long"
29:52;29:53;"Yeah"
29:53;29:54;"And then"
29:54;29:56;"But it was an amazing three days?"
29:56;29:58;"Incredible three days"
29:58;30:00;"And then we got two feet of snow"
30:00;30:01;"Hmm"
30:01;30:02;"Yeah"
30:02;30:03;"Oh yeah, that's rude"
30:03;30:04;"We kind of watched, um"
30:04;30:06;"I mentioned this before"
30:06;30:08;"The day we played Red Rocks"
30:08;30:10;"This actually happened twice on the last run"
30:10;30:13;"When we played outside of Portland"
30:13;30:15;"It was kind of like a very pleasant fall day"
30:15;30:17;"And then just like when we hit the stage"
30:17;30:18;"It just like dropped to like 40"
30:18;30:19;"And it was vibey"
30:19;30:20;"And it was a great show"
30:20;30:21;"But it was still kind of like"
30:21;30:22;"Holy sh*t it got cold"
30:22;30:25;"And then the last night we played Red Rocks"
30:25;30:27;"It was this insane drop"
30:27;30:29;"From like around 80 during the day"
30:29;30:31;"To light snow at night"
30:31;30:32;"And it was just kind of like"
30:32;30:34;"Damn, winter is here"
30:34;30:36;"But October, October's a great month"
30:36;30:37;"And it's got Halloween"
30:37;30:38;"And there's like"
30:38;30:40;"There's a real excitement in the air in October"
30:40;30:42;"I always feel like October just goes too fast"
30:42;30:45;"Because the anticipation of Halloween is so great"
30:45;30:46;"Yeah"
30:46;30:49;"That often times Halloween is just totally disappointing"
30:49;30:50;"Right"
30:50;30:51;"Because if you don't come up with a costume"
30:51;30:53;"A great costume"
30:53;30:55;"You might not leave your house"
30:55;30:56;"*laughs*"
30:56;30:58;"I gotta say"
30:58;31:00;"I don't like dressing up for Halloween"
31:00;31:01;"I don't either"
31:01;31:02;"And something's happened"
31:02;31:03;"And I have a few ideas why"
31:03;31:05;"I think you got Instagram"
31:05;31:06;"You got celebrity culture"
31:06;31:08;"Heidi Klum, how are you gonna outdo her then?"
31:08;31:10;"I think because of Instagram"
31:10;31:11;"And social media in general"
31:11;31:14;"There's just way more adults dressing up for Halloween"
31:14;31:15;"And I'm not even knocking it"
31:15;31:17;"Of course, that's one more benefit to dressing up"
31:17;31:20;"Is like you get to share it with other people on the internet"
31:20;31:22;"But now I feel like there's more times"
31:22;31:24;"Where you need to dress up for Halloween"
31:24;31:26;"Or if you go to a party"
31:26;31:27;"There's more adults dressing up"
31:27;31:29;"And more than ever before"
31:29;31:30;"And I think I just realized"
31:30;31:32;"Like I don't like dressing up"
31:32;31:33;"I agree"
31:33;31:34;"And it's not that fun"
31:34;31:35;"If you have the wrong costume"
31:35;31:37;"It's misery being dressed up"
31:37;31:39;"Any kind of like face paint"
31:39;31:40;"That you have to wear all night"
31:40;31:41;"Right"
31:41;31:42;"Where you're like all"
31:42;31:43;"Uncomfortable"
31:43;31:44;"Like can't touch your face"
31:44;31:45;"And you're like a little witch"
31:45;31:46;"The entire time"
31:46;31:47;"Something where your arms"
31:47;31:49;"Don't have like full movement"
31:49;31:50;"Awful"
31:50;31:51;"Yeah"
31:51;31:52;"This is what I do around Halloween now"
31:52;31:54;"And I watched it a few times"
31:54;31:55;"Leading up to Halloween"
31:55;31:57;"And I think I remember being shown"
31:57;31:58;"This film in school"
31:58;31:59;"It's a public service announcement"
31:59;32:01;"It's like Halloween safety"
32:01;32:02;"And it's like"
32:02;32:03;"What can you see that's wrong"
32:03;32:05;"With this little witch's costume?"
32:05;32:07;"And it's kind of creepy"
32:07;32:09;"It's like that"
32:09;32:10;"She can't move her hands"
32:10;32:12;"And that could cause her to get hurt"
32:12;32:14;"And that's very scary"
32:14;32:16;"Like you gotta watch it"
32:16;32:17;"It's really good"
32:17;32:18;"And then they're like"
32:18;32:20;"How about instead of a mask"
32:20;32:21;"It shows like the perspective"
32:21;32:23;"From inside the mask"
32:23;32:25;"And how she can hardly see anything"
32:25;32:26;"Right"
32:26;32:27;"That's like Halloween"
32:27;32:28;"Yeah"
32:28;32:29;"And she's dressed"
32:29;32:30;"Yeah yeah exactly"
32:30;32:31;"And she's dressed in black"
32:31;32:32;"And it shows her like crossing a street"
32:32;32:33;"With like a car"
32:33;32:34;"Getting hit by a car"
32:34;32:35;"Oh god"
32:35;32:36;"That could cause her not to be seen"
32:36;32:38;"By other drivers"
32:38;32:39;"Ouch"
32:39;32:40;"Down she goes again"
32:40;32:41;"Like she trips on a curb"
32:41;32:42;"That she can't see"
32:42;32:44;"It's like from 1977"
32:44;32:46;"And then she finally dies at the end"
32:46;32:48;"So they change her costume"
32:48;32:49;"To be a white witch"
32:49;32:50;"But then they call her a princess"
32:50;32:52;"Instead of a witch"
32:52;32:54;"And paint her face"
32:54;32:56;"They cut off her broomstick"
32:56;32:57;"They like cut off a sword"
32:57;32:58;"That was too long"
32:58;33:01;"Or maybe just not bring a broom at all"
33:01;33:04;"It's like"
33:04;33:05;"It's really pushy"
33:05;33:07;"It kind of like wants to take"
33:07;33:08;"All the fun out of it"
33:08;33:09;"I also wonder if that was low key"
33:09;33:11;"Made by some kind of like"
33:11;33:12;"Evangelical Christian organization"
33:12;33:13;"Probably"
33:13;33:14;"That were kind of just like"
33:14;33:16;"Basically we're saying don't be a witch"
33:16;33:17;"Exactly"
33:17;33:18;"No I think so for sure"
33:18;33:19;"Can I be a warlock?"
33:19;33:20;"Yeah"
33:20;33:22;"Yeah just not like"
33:22;33:24;"You can yeah be a safe witch"
33:24;33:30;"When I look out my window"
33:30;33:35;"Many sights to see"
33:35;33:40;"And when I look in my window"
33:40;33:45;"So many different people to be"
33:45;33:50;"That it's strange"
33:50;33:54;"So strange"
33:54;33:59;"You got to pick up every stitch"
34:04;34:11;"You got to pick up every stitch"
34:11;34:16;"Must be the season of the witch"
34:16;34:19;"Must be the season of the witch"
34:19;34:20;"Yeah"
34:20;34:24;"Must be the season of the witch"
34:24;34:28;"Time Crisis on Beats 1"
34:28;34:31;"What was the last Halloween costume you had?"
34:31;34:33;"Well actually I wanted to show Seinfeld"
34:33;34:35;"This is something that I chose not to post"
34:35;34:36;"Oh wow"
34:36;34:38;"But me and Rashida went to a Halloween party"
34:38;34:40;"Where there was some serious dress up"
34:40;34:44;"And the theme that the prompt was something like"
34:44;34:47;"Iconic entertainers from films and programs"
34:47;34:48;"Oh my god"
34:48;34:50;"I did have an idea that I got vaguely excited about"
34:50;34:52;"But also I think with dressing up"
34:52;34:54;"It's also it's more fun just to be like"
34:54;34:56;"Just throw out the idea and not do it"
34:56;34:58;"Because one idea I had for"
34:58;35:01;"Because we wanted to do something that would go together"
35:01;35:02;"This didn't fit the prompt"
35:02;35:07;"My first idea was that we should be AOC and Mark Zuckerberg"
35:07;35:10;"I thought we could both kind of pull it off"
35:10;35:11;"And it would be pretty good"
35:11;35:13;"But then they're not iconic entertainers"
35:13;35:15;"And then I was like aren't they?"
35:15;35:17;"Very timely"
35:17;35:18;"Anyway I don't think we nailed it"
35:18;35:20;"Seinfeld what do you think about this?"
35:20;35:21;"Oh my god"
35:21;35:23;"Why didn't you post this?"
35:23;35:25;"Did you dress all the way up?"
35:25;35:27;"This is incredible yeah"
35:27;35:29;"Halloween's private"
35:29;35:31;"I think you guys did nail it"
35:31;35:35;"And I think it's a shame that the world does not get to see this"
35:35;35:36;"Let me see"
35:36;35:37;"You know what you got it"
35:37;35:38;"So you just dressed up at home?"
35:38;35:40;"No no we just went home and went to a party"
35:40;35:41;"Okay you went to a party"
35:41;35:43;"Would you know who we were just from looking at it?"
35:43;35:46;"Yeah which is one conversation I had this year"
35:46;35:48;"With one of our bandmates"
35:48;35:49;"Jake and I's bandmates"
35:49;35:51;"He's like everyone's always like"
35:51;35:52;"What are you supposed to be?"
35:52;35:55;"Which is like the worst insult to a costume"
35:55;35:56;"Oh yeah"
35:56;35:57;"You show up and then they're like"
35:57;35:59;"Cool what is it?"
35:59;36:02;"I feel like that's hard with like meme based costumes too"
36:02;36:03;"Cause you have to be like"
36:03;36:04;"Oh well then it started"
36:04;36:05;"You have to explain the meme as well"
36:05;36:06;"Oh what's that?"
36:06;36:07;"Heavy"
36:07;36:11;"It's a picture of a guy that they use a lot to kind of express"
36:11;36:13;"When something's like really f***ing random"
36:13;36:15;"And it's like"
36:15;36:19;"I think Rashida's Elaine costume was like perfect"
36:19;36:22;"And then I think with Jerry I got more or less the right clothes"
36:22;36:24;"But then the wig I got"
36:24;36:26;"It was kind of a mullet wig but the hair was too straight"
36:26;36:29;"I don't know some people got it immediately"
36:29;36:31;"And then yeah other people were kind of like"
36:31;36:32;"What are you guys?"
36:32;36:33;"And then we're kind of like"
36:33;36:34;"Okay"
36:34;36:35;"Big TV"
36:35;36:37;"Yeah you would have been very triggered Seinfeld"
36:37;36:38;"I'm triggered right now"
36:38;36:41;"You're like big TV show from the 90's"
36:41;36:42;"ER?"
36:42;36:44;"Huge show from the 90's just looking at stuff and down"
36:44;36:45;"No idea"
36:45;36:46;"And then just like Seinfeld"
36:46;36:47;"Just like"
36:47;36:48;"Oh okay"
36:48;36:51;"You gotta remember not everybody's a Seinfeld fan"
36:51;36:52;"They should be"
36:54;36:56;"So anyway that's the last time I dressed up"
36:56;36:59;"And one good thing about that costume is"
36:59;37:02;"All I had to buy were some Levi's 501's"
37:02;37:03;"Yep"
37:03;37:05;"I kind of had the right sneakers already and the right shirt"
37:05;37:07;"So I just had to buy some jeans and a wig"
37:07;37:11;"It's a comfortable enough costume that I kind of forgot I was wearing a costume"
37:11;37:13;"Then I catch a glimpse of myself with the wig and just be like"
37:13;37:14;"Ugh"
37:14;37:17;"Weird vibe"
37:17;37:19;"Did you guys dress up for Halloween this year?"
37:19;37:20;"No"
37:20;37:21;"We went to a Halloween party"
37:21;37:22;"What are you"
37:22;37:23;"Yes I did"
37:23;37:24;"Well Hannah did"
37:24;37:26;"You went to a Halloween party but you didn't leave your house"
37:26;37:27;"So you guys"
37:27;37:29;"I was one of the few people"
37:29;37:30;"So was it"
37:30;37:33;"It was actually your cousin Greta's Halloween party"
37:33;37:34;"Oh"
37:34;37:35;"She lives in our neighborhood"
37:35;37:36;"Oh sick"
37:36;37:37;"We popped over"
37:37;37:39;"Oh yeah for that party we didn't dress up"
37:39;37:43;"I would say I was one of maybe two or three people that did not dress up"
37:43;37:48;"And there were like a good 40 people there who were in full nine costume"
37:48;37:49;"Right"
37:49;37:52;"Full makeup, masks, stuff that will be in the dumpster the next day"
37:52;37:53;"Yeah"
37:53;37:54;"That's why I don't like costumes"
37:54;37:58;"I don't want to go buy something to wear once to throw it away"
37:58;37:59;"I hear you"
37:59;38:01;"It's one of the most wasteful holidays of all time"
38:01;38:02;"It seems crazy"
38:02;38:03;"Right"
38:03;38:04;"Well"
38:04;38:05;"I know that's a real stick in the mud attitude"
38:05;38:08;"I think people should just make without ruining your clothes"
38:08;38:09;"Yeah"
38:09;38:13;"Come up with a costume out of what you already have"
38:13;38:15;"It's like a scavenger hunt inside your house"
38:15;38:17;"You know what would be a good costume that you could do every year"
38:17;38:20;"Now Jake that you're taking kind of the environmental stance"
38:20;38:21;"Yeah"
38:21;38:23;"I'm like the green peace guy on the street"
38:23;38:24;"That's true"
38:24;38:25;"On the board"
38:25;38:29;"Jake is a green peace t-shirt which you could rock year round"
38:29;38:30;"Absolutely"
38:30;38:32;"So we'll get you the green peace shirt and then you just have a clipboard"
38:32;38:34;"When people come up and be like what are you supposed to be?"
38:34;38:35;"Be like"
38:35;38:36;"Sir can I interest"
38:36;38:37;"Yeah can I interest you"
38:37;38:39;"Looks like you're somebody who doesn't care that much about the environment"
38:39;38:40;"Let me"
38:40;38:42;"If I talk to you for five minutes"
38:42;38:44;"Just walk out of like a low-key Halloween party"
38:44;38:47;"Raising $340 for green peace"
38:47;38:49;"They had me for 10 to"
38:49;38:51;"I can't remember when I lived in San Francisco"
38:51;38:55;"I was probably on some legal THC but"
38:55;38:59;"They can spot that too from a mile away"
38:59;39:01;"They're like this person looks vulnerable"
39:01;39:02;"Or like"
39:02;39:04;"And I was skateboarding"
39:04;39:07;"And then he was like hey man can I talk to you for a second"
39:07;39:08;"And I was just like"
39:08;39:09;"Like"
39:09;39:10;"A clippy"
39:10;39:13;"My friend calls them clippies"
39:13;39:15;"People with clipboards it's like"
39:15;39:18;"Oh man it's a clippy oh no no no"
39:18;39:22;"And that friend says"
39:22;39:24;"Sorry I don't give money to clippies"
39:24;39:26;"To their face"
39:26;39:27;"That's just their"
39:27;39:29;"Sorry I don't give money to clippies"
39:29;39:33;"But they had me for 10 to 30 bucks a month"
39:33;39:34;"Green peace or who?"
39:34;39:35;"Amnesty International?"
39:35;39:36;"Okay"
39:36;39:37;"Yeah"
39:37;39:39;"The best is there's that Whole Foods in Silver Lake"
39:39;39:41;"And there's all these people outside of that Whole Foods"
39:41;39:42;"And they always go"
39:42;39:44;"Sir do you have a minute for human rights?"
39:44;39:45;"I mean"
39:45;39:47;"Which is the most intense thing"
39:47;39:48;"To say"
39:48;39:49;"It's a great hook"
39:50;39:51;"Like of course I have a minute for human rights"
39:51;39:53;"I'm going to buy some like"
39:53;39:55;"Indian food and kombucha for lunch so"
39:55;39:57;"I can"
39:57;39:58;"I have a minute"
39:58;39:59;"I think the truth is"
39:59;40:02;"And if you have supported those organizations before"
40:02;40:04;"Like a green peace or a"
40:04;40:06;"Human rights campaign or something"
40:06;40:08;"And also you gotta understand for those people"
40:08;40:10;"They're getting paid"
40:10;40:11;"Oh yeah"
40:11;40:12;"Seems like a rough gig"
40:12;40:13;"Yeah that's a tough gig"
40:13;40:14;"I've done a similar thing"
40:14;40:16;"That I'm sure I've talked about where I"
40:16;40:18;"I went door to door for the"
40:18;40:19;"NJPIRG"
40:19;40:21;"New Jersey Public Interest Research Group"
40:21;40:23;"And I was like door to door just like"
40:23;40:25;"We're trying to like pass legislation"
40:25;40:26;"That's going to clean up the air and"
40:26;40:28;"You know it's like"
40:28;40:31;"I think I got paid bonuses based on how much money I raised"
40:31;40:32;"You know it's a grind"
40:32;40:34;"But I just always like to say"
40:34;40:35;"Just like"
40:35;40:36;"Great organization I support you"
40:36;40:37;"Good luck"
40:37;40:39;"Instead of like averting eye contact and like"
40:39;40:40;"Just say like"
40:40;40:41;"Ducking into the store"
40:41;40:42;"That's a very loaded question"
40:42;40:44;"Do I have a minute for human rights?"
40:44;40:45;"What are you implying?"
40:45;40:46;"I just like to be like"
40:46;40:47;"Yo good luck at"
40:47;40:49;"Like you're out there grinding for a good cause"
40:49;40:50;"And I respect that"
40:50;40:51;"Maybe I should just say that"
40:51;40:52;"I just didn't really say like"
40:52;40:53;"No no I support you"
40:53;40:55;"I support you good luck"
40:55;40:57;"Cause they probably do get the occasional"
40:57;40:59;"Just like nut job who's just like"
40:59;41:00;"F*** you"
41:00;41:02;"What you're doing is bad"
41:02;41:03;"You're a bad person"
41:03;41:05;"So I like to just give them a little like"
41:05;41:06;"Shout out to you"
41:06;41:08;"You know the problem with the clippy people is that"
41:08;41:10;"Once you donate"
41:10;41:11;"They go"
41:11;41:12;"The organization goes"
41:12;41:13;"Oh this person"
41:13;41:14;"You know is willing to give us money"
41:14;41:15;"And then they never leave you alone"
41:15;41:16;"It's true"
41:16;41:17;"And they're calling you"
41:17;41:18;"And they're emailing you"
41:18;41:19;"Yeah"
41:19;41:20;"And then you're like"
41:20;41:22;"Oh why did I get myself entangled in the clippy?"
41:22;41:23;"So if you're listening"
41:23;41:24;"And you're one of"
41:24;41:26;"Part of one of those organizations"
41:26;41:27;"Maybe pump the brakes a little bit"
41:27;41:28;"On the follow up"
41:28;41:30;"If you've got the hook in"
41:30;41:31;"Just like"
41:31;41:33;"Okay just put another hook in someone else"
41:33;41:34;"That's right"
41:34;41:35;"Instead of"
41:35;41:36;"Instead of reeling them in"
41:36;41:37;"Right"
41:37;41:38;"Let the line out a little bit"
41:38;41:39;"Give them a little slack"
41:39;41:42;"And also if somebody's obviously stoned"
41:42;41:43;"Let them pass"
41:43;41:44;"Thank you Ezra"
41:44;41:45;"Let them pass"
41:45;41:47;"Wait so Hannah you did dress up for Halloween?"
41:47;41:48;"What was your costume?"
41:48;41:49;"I did"
41:49;41:51;"I dressed up as Jake"
41:51;41:52;"Oh"
41:52;41:54;"Wait maybe I saw that on Instagram"
41:54;41:56;"Yeah with Chris Thompson's wife"
41:56;41:59;"Jenny Olsen of Sweet Martha's fame"
41:59;42:00;"Wait you were all Jake?"
42:00;42:01;"Yeah we were all different Jakes"
42:01;42:02;"Yeah there were three people dressed as me"
42:02;42:03;"No way"
42:03;42:04;"Three modes of Jake"
42:04;42:06;"Wait isn't there a movie called The Three Jakes?"
42:06;42:07;"There should be"
42:07;42:08;"Yeah that sounds like something"
42:08;42:10;"The something Jakes"
42:10;42:11;"Like the two Jakes"
42:11;42:12;"Two Jakes?"
42:12;42:13;"Is that the Chinatown sequel?"
42:13;42:14;"Maybe it is"
42:14;42:15;"Anyway"
42:15;42:16;"That's cool"
42:16;42:17;"Yeah"
42:17;42:18;"That's great"
42:18;42:19;"See that's a neat costume"
42:19;42:20;"You had access to"
42:20;42:21;"I had a backpack on"
42:21;42:23;"Jake's wardrobe too so"
42:23;42:25;"You probably didn't have to go"
42:25;42:26;"That's true"
42:26;42:28;"Buy some toxic plastic costume on Amazon"
42:28;42:29;"That's true"
42:29;42:30;"Although they do sell those"
42:30;42:31;"Jake Longstrap"
42:31;42:32;"No but they"
42:32;42:33;"Porn fam costume on Amazon"
42:33;42:35;"They can never say exactly who it is"
42:35;42:36;"So they always have to describe it differently"
42:36;42:37;"So it would literally be like"
42:37;42:39;"American painter and radio personality costume"
42:39;42:40;"You're like"
42:40;42:42;"We all know who you're talking about"
42:42;42:45;"I think I wore"
42:45;42:47;"There's like a Wikipedia"
42:47;42:49;"Jake Wikipedia page t-shirt"
42:49;42:50;"Oh yeah classic"
42:50;42:51;"So I wore"
42:51;42:53;"I was more the idea of Jake"
42:53;42:54;"Yeah"
42:55;42:58;"And then Jenny and Emily were different versions"
42:58;43:01;"They were wearing Richard Picture shirts"
43:01;43:02;"Uh huh"
43:02;43:03;"Jeans"
43:03;43:04;"And like kind of like a"
43:04;43:05;"But Jake"
43:05;43:06;"And a fleece"
43:06;43:07;"They walked in"
43:07;43:08;"Facial hair?"
43:08;43:09;"No fake beard"
43:09;43:10;"Not gonna be fun at a party"
43:10;43:11;"Right"
43:11;43:12;"Running shoes"
43:12;43:13;"I trust"
43:13;43:14;"But they walked in"
43:14;43:15;"And Jake"
43:15;43:16;"Thank you"
43:16;43:17;"Had a lot of notes"
43:17;43:18;"Oh"
43:18;43:19;"On their look"
43:19;43:20;"Well one"
43:20;43:21;"The big one was"
43:21;43:22;"Untuck the T"
43:22;43:23;"Right"
43:23;43:24;"Yeah what are you thinking?"
43:24;43:25;"You don't tuck the T"
43:25;43:26;"Yeah yeah yeah"
43:26;43:27;"So this sounds more like"
43:27;43:29;"Everybody was doing an impressionistic nod"
43:29;43:31;"Towards the spirit of Jake"
43:31;43:32;"Yeah exactly"
43:32;43:34;"Maybe we should just do a Jake party"
43:34;43:35;"On your birthday"
43:35;43:36;"Wow"
43:36;43:37;"I don't know if I'd like that idea"
43:37;43:38;"February?"
43:38;43:39;"It would be like"
43:39;43:40;"February"
43:40;43:41;"It would be like when Eminem"
43:41;43:43;"Performed at the VMAs"
43:43;43:45;"And the auditorium flooded"
43:45;43:48;"With hundreds of Eminems"
43:48;43:50;"Well maybe we'll see if uh"
43:50;43:53;"If we can finagle a Mountain Brews performance"
43:53;43:55;"At the VMAs next year"
43:55;43:59;"Just hundreds of"
43:59;44:01;"Hundreds of Jakes walk in"
44:01;44:02;"Cold open"
44:02;44:03;"Yeah"
44:03;44:04;"Shoulders"
44:04;44:06;"Flannels"
44:06;44:07;"Just picturing like"
44:07;44:09;"Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber"
44:09;44:10;"Just like clapping along"
44:10;44:11;"And like looking"
44:11;44:12;"Okay alright"
44:12;44:14;"Mountain Brews"
44:15;44:17;"Sunday morning"
44:17;44:20;"Why don't we go for a hike"
44:20;44:23;"Meet in the trailhead light"
44:23;44:25;"Around a quarter to three"
44:25;44:28;"Me and Bobby"
44:28;44:31;"Stayed out late last night"
44:31;44:34;"Get on the trail"
44:34;44:36;"Shake the cobwebs free"
44:36;44:40;"As we get to the top of the mountain"
44:40;44:42;"There's a view"
44:43;44:48;"Take a load off and crack a few Mountain Brews"
44:48;44:56;"Mountain Brews"
44:56;44:59;"Sweet Mountain Brews"
44:59;45:07;"Mountain Brews"
45:07;45:09;"Sweet as morning dew"
45:09;45:10;"So anyway"
45:10;45:11;"October"
45:11;45:12;"A very fascinating month"
45:12;45:14;"Even though it ends with Halloween"
45:14;45:16;"Which is increasingly becoming an annoying holiday"
45:16;45:17;"I will say"
45:17;45:19;"A lot of Vampire Weekend costumes"
45:19;45:21;"And partially it's because"
45:21;45:23;"We got some creative ones where people thought outside the box"
45:23;45:26;"But it's become a low-key Halloween classic"
45:26;45:29;"Although when you were talking about this idea of people saying ""What are you?"""
45:29;45:32;"I do sometimes get nervous when I see people dressing up as Vampire Weekend"
45:32;45:34;"And this is what the classic Vampire Weekend costume is"
45:34;45:37;"And the first time I saw it was probably 11 years ago"
45:37;45:39;"You get one or two buddies"
45:39;45:41;"Because you could be Saturday and Sunday"
45:41;45:43;"Or you could even be Friday, Saturday, Sunday"
45:43;45:45;"And on some part of your body"
45:45;45:47;"Or you get a sign, you write the day of the week"
45:47;45:48;"And then you're all vampires"
45:48;45:50;"So then you stand together"
45:50;45:52;"And okay, you know, you're Saturday vampire, I'm Sunday vampire"
45:52;45:54;"Somebody says ""What are you guys?"""
45:54;45:55;"And you say ""We're Vampire Weekend"""
45:55;45:57;"And it's kind of a good costume because"
45:57;46:00;"A vampire is a classic Halloween costume anyway"
46:00;46:02;"So even I guess"
46:02;46:05;"If nobody knows who Vampire Weekend is"
46:05;46:08;"It's not as abstract as if you were guided by voices"
46:08;46:10;"For instance"
46:10;46:13;"But occasionally, and I noticed an uptick this year"
46:13;46:14;"Of people doing it"
46:14;46:16;"And it's a fun and easy costume"
46:16;46:19;"But I just, you know, sometimes imagine people somewhere"
46:19;46:20;"And just be like"
46:20;46:22;"People be like ""What are you? Like, you're vampires?"""
46:22;46:24;"Like ""No, we're Vampire Weekend"""
46:24;46:25;"Just like ""What does that mean?"""
46:25;46:29;"""We're an American indie band formed in 2006 at Columbia University"""
46:29;46:31;"Just like ""Really?"""
46:31;46:32;"Random"
46:32;46:33;"And I'm just like ""Oof"""
46:33;46:35;"Anyway, if you dressed up as Vampire Weekend this year"
46:35;46:38;"Send Seinfeld an email, let us know how it went"
46:38;46:39;"But yeah, October is a great month"
46:39;46:42;"And then of course December has a, you know"
46:42;46:44;"Many people love this, it's their favorite month"
46:44;46:47;"So November is the middle child of Q4"
46:47;46:49;"Consumer spending is high"
46:49;46:50;"Yep"
46:50;46:53;"That's what gets really depressing to me about the season"
46:53;46:56;"Is the holidays and the commercialization of"
46:56;46:58;"Whatever you believe, religiously or not"
46:58;46:59;"Or whatever"
46:59;47:00;"It's just like"
47:00;47:02;"I just remember just feeling like"
47:02;47:05;"So much clutter just comes into the house when you're growing up"
47:05;47:07;"Of like ""Decorate! Like, decorations!"""
47:07;47:09;"And then I remember the mixed feeling"
47:09;47:11;"Even as a kid you had mixed feelings about that"
47:11;47:14;"Yeah, I didn't know what I was really feeling then"
47:14;47:15;"Right?"
47:15;47:16;"But it was just kind of like"
47:16;47:18;"This joy of gift giving"
47:18;47:19;"""And I love you, thanks mom"""
47:19;47:21;"""Oh my gosh, like a Star Wars toy"""
47:21;47:22;"And then like"
47:22;47:23;"But then the whole thing"
47:23;47:25;"Like a build up to the whole thing"
47:25;47:27;"And we, you know, celebrated Christmas"
47:27;47:28;"But then tearing apart all this"
47:28;47:29;"And then just like"
47:29;47:31;"Dad dutifully bringing out the garbage bag"
47:31;47:34;"And just throwing away this perfect wrapping paper"
47:34;47:35;"That got used once"
47:35;47:36;"Just like buckets"
47:36;47:39;"Like bags and bags of trash"
47:39;47:40;"And then just like"
47:40;47:42;"""Oh, that was fun!"""
47:42;47:43;"Yeah, kind of empty"
47:43;47:45;"""That was fun, it's over"""
47:45;47:47;"And then people kind of wander off awkwardly"
47:47;47:50;"Like ""I'm gonna go play with my toy now"""
47:50;47:51;"You know what?"
47:51;47:52;"I just came up with a hot take"
47:52;47:54;"Inspired by what you said"
47:54;47:55;"Now I'm not a Christian"
47:55;47:56;"Was not raised in the Christian faith"
47:56;47:58;"Although I have a lot of admiration for it"
47:58;48:02;"But I never grew up celebrating Christmas"
48:02;48:04;"So either I have less perspective"
48:04;48:06;"As an outsider"
48:06;48:07;"Or maybe more"
48:07;48:08;"Now we know that"
48:08;48:10;"In our fractured society"
48:10;48:11;"There's been a lot of talk about"
48:11;48:12;"The war on Christmas"
48:12;48:15;"Somehow that conversation still isn't over"
48:15;48:16;"And even sometimes"
48:16;48:18;"When you get kind of kind vibe Christians"
48:18;48:20;"Cause I love a good Christian hippie"
48:20;48:22;"And I fully believe that Jesus was a hippie"
48:22;48:24;"But sometimes you get people saying like"
48:24;48:26;"""Oh man, we're losing the spirit of Christmas"""
48:26;48:28;"""We gotta put the Christ back in Christmas"""
48:28;48:30;"And I like that argument"
48:30;48:32;"Because the teachings of Jesus"
48:32;48:35;"It'd be very hard to call them materialistic"
48:35;48:36;"Arguably they're the opposite"
48:36;48:38;"Those are the two sides of the argument, right?"
48:38;48:40;"It's like, no, it's cool, Christmas"
48:40;48:41;"You buy everything"
48:41;48:42;"Get the kids toys"
48:42;48:44;"Fill the house with bullsh*t"
48:44;48:46;"If you don't, you're gonna let everybody down"
48:46;48:48;"Versus put the Christ back in Christmas"
48:48;48:50;"But then a third way of looking at it"
48:50;48:51;"Is that actually"
48:51;48:54;"Christmas, it's a syncretic holiday"
48:54;48:56;"So let me get a number crunch"
48:56;48:58;"This is the most clearly not a number crunch"
48:58;48:59;"Let me get a verb"
48:59;49:01;"Verbiage crunch"
49:01;49:04;"Let me get a verb crunch on syncretic"
49:04;49:07;"Syncretism is a combination of separate concepts"
49:07;49:09;"Into one new unique idea"
49:09;49:11;"Cultural syncretism"
49:11;49:13;"Is when an aspect of two or more distinct cultures"
49:13;49:17;"Blend to create a new custom idea, practice, or philosophy"
49:17;49:21;"I believe Christmas academics would call it a syncretic holiday"
49:21;49:22;"Or an example of syncretism"
49:22;49:27;"Because it combines the teachings of the Middle Eastern hippie"
49:27;49:29;"Known as Jesus, Christ the King"
49:29;49:37;"With the pagan traditions of the tribal people of Central Europe"
49:37;49:38;"Or maybe Western Europe too"
49:38;49:43;"But, you know, basically I'm picturing the pre-Christian Germans"
49:43;49:45;"Who were celebrating the solstice"
49:45;49:46;"They were celebrating the solstice"
49:46;49:48;"And doing kind of their pagan stuff"
49:48;49:50;"And so rather than put the Christ back in Christmas"
49:50;49:53;"Which actually, we should put the Christ back in Christmas"
49:53;49:55;"Or you should if you celebrate Christmas"
49:55;49:59;"But I also think there should be a little more from the pagan tradition"
49:59;50:00;"You know what I mean?"
50:00;50:02;"Because those are the two parts of it"
50:02;50:04;"The third part is Coca-Cola"
50:04;50:06;"Oh, yeah"
50:06;50:08;"The Coca-Cola Santa Claus invention, right?"
50:08;50:10;"And those polar bears"
50:10;50:12;"Yeah, well they say that Coca-Cola, right?"
50:12;50:15;"Made Christmas red and white"
50:15;50:17;"Like designed the palette for Santa Claus"
50:17;50:19;"That's an urban myth, but"
50:19;50:21;"Whoa, I would buy it because"
50:21;50:23;"Yeah, like Saint Nicholas"
50:23;50:25;"He wasn't always red and white"
50:25;50:26;"Another syncretic"
50:26;50:27;"Yeah"
50:27;50:28;"You need three, right?"
50:28;50:30;"Well, that's a Godard quote too"
50:30;50:32;"About the children of Marx and Coca-Cola"
50:32;50:35;"Maybe he was talking about Christmas"
50:35;50:38;"Here come old Flat Top"
50:38;50:41;"He come grooving up slowly"
50:41;50:44;"Got juju eyeball"
50:44;50:47;"He want Holy Roller"
50:47;50:52;"He got hair down to his knee"
50:52;50:55;"Got to be a joker"
50:55;50:58;"He just do what he please"
50:58;51:13;"He wear no shoeshine"
51:13;51:16;"He got toe jam football"
51:16;51:19;"He got monkey finger"
51:19;51:22;"He shoot Coca-Cola"
51:22;51:25;"He said, I know you"
51:25;51:28;"You know me"
51:28;51:31;"One thing I can tell you"
51:31;51:34;"Is you got to be free"
51:34;51:36;"Come together"
51:36;51:39;"Right now"
51:39;51:40;"Over me"
51:40;51:42;"So we need a little less Coca-Cola on Christmas"
51:42;51:43;"And a little more Christ"
51:43;51:45;"But we also need a little more of the paganism"
51:45;51:47;"Because I think"
51:47;51:49;"One thing that I understand about paganism is that"
51:49;51:51;"Because it's built around the seasons"
51:51;51:53;"And things coming and going"
51:53;51:55;"And the sun rising and setting"
51:55;51:56;"And the crops and you know all this stuff"
51:56;51:57;"It's in touch, right?"
51:57;51:58;"It's really in touch with nature"
51:58;52:01;"And it's in touch with this basic fact of human life"
52:01;52:03;"Which is that things end"
52:03;52:05;"And so I think"
52:05;52:08;"A, the capitalist Christmas would feel less empty"
52:08;52:10;"If rather than just throw it in a garbage bag"
52:10;52:12;"You did some kind of more like"
52:12;52:14;"Wicker man mid-summer type thing"
52:14;52:15;"And burn it"
52:15;52:17;"And of course check with your local authorities"
52:17;52:19;"And you know don't burn anything toxic"
52:19;52:20;"I didn't say that"
52:20;52:21;"I don't know who said that"
52:21;52:22;"Especially here in California"
52:22;52:24;"Where we're suffering through wildfire season"
52:24;52:25;"I know, yeah"
52:25;52:28;"But I think there could be something really powerful about that"
52:28;52:30;"I mean it's why people like burning manna"
52:30;52:32;"It's because they're getting back in touch with some pagan stuff"
52:32;52:33;"Is that maybe at the end of the day"
52:33;52:35;"You take all the wrapping paper or something"
52:35;52:37;"And it's not just like throw it out"
52:37;52:40;"Or wrap it in frickin' newspaper"
52:40;52:42;"Like who gives a crap?"
52:42;52:44;"Yeah, but I think there should be some sort of like"
52:44;52:45;"The season is over"
52:45;52:47;"I think something has to go on fire"
52:47;52:51;"You have to watch the fire turn something into ashes"
52:51;52:52;"I guess actually I don't want to be like"
52:52;52:53;"This is all about Christmas"
52:53;52:56;"Maybe we just need more pagan tradition in our lives, period"
52:56;52:58;"More public bonfires"
52:58;52:59;"Yeah, maybe as simple as that"
52:59;53:00;"More bonfires"
53:00;53:02;"Where I thought you were going to go was"
53:02;53:04;"With Hanukkah don't you get to open presents"
53:04;53:06;"Like over the course of many days"
53:06;53:08;"Rather than just one blast?"
53:08;53:11;"Yes, although that's also the commercialization"
53:11;53:16;"One 25 minute blast at 7am"
53:16;53:17;"Yeah, yeah"
53:17;53:18;"And then you're"
53:18;53:19;"Whoa"
53:19;53:20;"Where did I get this shit?"
53:20;53:21;"Yeah"
53:21;53:22;"So early"
53:22;53:24;"With Hanukkah you get 8 mini blasts"
53:24;53:26;"Totally"
53:26;53:27;"Well, you know"
53:27;53:29;"We were up at like 5 sometimes"
53:29;53:30;"My parents would be like"
53:30;53:31;"Go back to bed"
53:31;53:33;"I kind of still like that at Jake's house"
53:33;53:34;"We were up till 2"
53:34;53:36;"Bring a BMX bike together"
53:36;53:37;"Yeah"
53:37;53:39;"Well, you know, Hanukkah is the same thing"
53:39;53:41;"Hanukkah is"
53:41;53:45;"My understanding too is that Hanukkah was considered a fairly minor Jewish holiday"
53:45;53:47;"And then they bumped it up to the big leagues"
53:47;53:49;"Just to compete with Christmas"
53:49;53:53;"And just so that Jewish kids could also get their present blast"
53:53;53:55;"Albeit in the form of 8 mini blasts"
53:55;53:56;"Totally"
53:56;54:01;"And, you know, there's nothing about the gift giving that really corresponds to the story"
54:01;54:03;"In fact, it's kind of a weird dark story"
54:03;54:05;"I'm pretty sure it's about the"
54:05;54:09;"The Maccabee rebels fighting against the Roman Empire"
54:09;54:10;"I believe"
54:10;54:12;"And then they were, you know, surrounded"
54:12;54:14;"It's a bit of an Alamo story"
54:14;54:15;"Wow"
54:15;54:17;"They were surrounded and then they were running out of supplies"
54:17;54:20;"And then the oil lasted for 8 nights"
54:20;54:22;"So they could keep the flame burning"
54:22;54:24;"And I think it had kind of a dark ending"
54:24;54:25;"I don't think it ended well"
54:25;54:27;"It's more of a military story"
54:27;54:29;"[Laughter]"
54:29;54:31;"Do those blasts of gifts"
54:31;54:34;"Do they like increase in value per night or anything like that?"
54:34;54:38;"Do you want to kind of crescendo with like the Nintendo DS at the end?"
54:38;54:39;"Or are they..."
54:39;54:41;"It's kind of like a game show"
54:41;54:44;"Every night you can either take the gift and bank it"
54:44;54:45;"Or you can move on to the next round"
54:45;54:46;"For real?"
54:46;54:48;"No, but actually"
54:48;54:50;"I think that's the new tradition that I'm going to start"
54:50;54:52;"[Laughter]"
54:52;54:53;"Night 1"
54:53;54:55;"You've got a keychain with your name on it"
54:55;54:56;"[Laughter]"
54:56;54:59;"For all you know, nights 2 through 8 are even worse"
54:59;55:00;"[Laughter]"
55:00;55:01;"I'm into this"
55:01;55:02;"You could walk away right now"
55:02;55:04;"And have that shiny keychain with your name on it"
55:04;55:05;"Or you have to give it up"
55:05;55:06;"Or you let it ride"
55:06;55:08;"[Laughter]"
55:08;55:10;"Have you heard of Dirty Santa?"
55:10;55:11;"Oh no"
55:11;55:13;"It's not what you think"
55:13;55:15;"Some people call it"
55:15;55:16;"I forget"
55:16;55:18;"It doesn't have the word dirty or Santa"
55:18;55:20;"But it's kind of maybe Christmas Eve"
55:20;55:22;"When everyone brings a white elephant gift"
55:22;55:24;"And then you can like steal them from each other"
55:24;55:26;"It's like the anti..."
55:26;55:28;"Yeah, no, the game is also just called White Elephant sometimes"
55:28;55:29;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
55:29;55:30;"Yeah, I've heard about this"
55:30;55:31;"Yeah"
55:31;55:32;"It's like Secret Santa"
55:32;55:34;"Plus an element of gamesmanship"
55:34;55:37;"And people bring something that they got the year before"
55:37;55:40;"That they never even took out of the plastic wrap"
55:40;55:43;"Like these coffee mugs that no one would ever want"
55:43;55:46;"I play that every year with a friend of the show, Ariel"
55:46;55:49;"Oh right, yeah, I've heard about this major white elephant"
55:49;55:50;"It's a Hanukkah white elephant"
55:50;55:51;"Okay"
55:51;55:52;"Yeah"
55:52;55:53;"Yeah, Ariel"
55:53;55:57;"I believe the game White Elephant was invented by Ezra Cornell"
55:57;55:58;"Seinfeld?"
55:58;55:59;"[Laughter]"
55:59;56:00;"I'm on it"
56:00;56:01;"Yes"
56:01;56:03;"The White Elephant Gift Exchange"
56:03;56:06;"And it's founding father, Ezra Cornell"
56:06;56:07;"[Laughter]"
56:07;56:08;"Would you like more information?"
56:08;56:09;"Deep"
56:09;56:10;"How'd you know that?"
56:10;56:12;"What else did he do? He founded Cornell?"
56:12;56:13;"Yeah, why did you know that?"
56:13;56:14;"Because you were..."
56:14;56:16;"When your name's Ezra"
56:16;56:17;"Okay"
56:17;56:19;"Although now there's a few too many, I don't care anymore"
56:19;56:21;"But for the first 32 years of life"
56:21;56:23;"You would always remember when you heard an Ezra story"
56:23;56:26;"We heard about some other Ezra, we'll just stick with you"
56:26;56:28;"Yeah, he founded Ezra's Cornell University"
56:28;56:30;"Ezra's Cornell"
56:30;56:33;"Yeah, later shortened to Cornell"
56:33;56:36;"Which also kind of ties into Grateful Dead history"
56:36;56:38;"Ezra Cornell '77"
56:38;56:39;"'77"
56:39;56:40;"[Laughter]"
57:09;57:12;"I don't worry, I've been known"
57:12;57:15;"And I've been nowhere, well"
57:15;57:18;"Nah, nah, nah, I've been nowhere, I've known"
57:18;57:21;"California"
57:21;57:25;"Preaching on the burning show"
57:25;57:27;"California"
57:27;57:31;"I've been knocking on the golden door"
57:31;57:34;"Like an angel"
57:34;57:37;"Standing in a chapel light"
57:37;57:40;"Rising up to parry taboo"
57:40;57:44;"No, I'm gonna shine"
57:44;57:46;"You're listening to"
57:46;57:47;"[Beep, beep, beep]"
57:47;57:49;"Time Crisis"
57:49;57:51;"On Beat 1"
57:51;57:53;"We're drinking mimosas in the studio"
57:53;57:54;"Bagels"
57:54;57:55;"I'm loving this Gratefulsgiving"
57:55;57:59;"At this point, we've talked about Halloween, November"
57:59;58:00;"And now a little bit of Christmas"
58:00;58:02;"We've really covered Q4"
58:02;58:05;"Which is one of the biggest Q's in a lot of industries"
58:05;58:07;"Like I said, consumer spending is way up"
58:07;58:10;"In the film industry, they bet big on Q4"
58:10;58:12;"Retail? Forget about it"
58:12;58:14;"I mean, that was the classic thing in music"
58:14;58:16;"That they would save the big releases for Q4"
58:16;58:17;"Led Zeppelin box set"
58:17;58:18;"Came out at Q4?"
58:18;58:19;"Yeah, for sure"
58:19;58:21;"Well, because it's such a perfect Christmas present"
58:21;58:23;"Well, I learned that when I tried to start putting out records"
58:23;58:28;"They were like, no, no, no, you never release a record after September 30th or so"
58:28;58:30;"Unless you're [Beep] Led Zeppelin"
58:30;58:31;"Unless you're Led Zeppelin"
58:31;58:33;"Little Wings competing with that Zeppelin box set"
58:33;58:34;"I've heard that too"
58:34;58:36;"This is back in the super physical day"
58:36;58:38;"It's like the person who goes into a record store"
58:38;58:40;"Literally once a year"
58:40;58:43;"And they're just like, what to get for dad?"
58:43;58:46;"What's going to hit me across the head when I walk in?"
58:46;58:48;"Like, top shelf"
58:48;58:50;"There probably are a lot of people who"
58:50;58:53;"Especially in the 90s, in the early 2000s"
58:53;58:56;"Who just were like, vaguely a fan of some band"
58:56;58:57;"I can totally picture that too"
58:57;58:59;"Just like, dad, what's your favorite band?"
58:59;59:02;"Um, well, you know, back when I was your age"
59:02;59:04;"We would throw in a Led Zeppelin record in the dorm room"
59:04;59:06;"And, uh, man, we loved that stuff"
59:06;59:08;"Whole Lotta Love, great song"
59:08;59:13;"And then the kid's just like, dad, I got you a 48 disc Led Zeppelin box set"
59:13;59:15;"And you'll be interested to know"
59:15;59:18;"There are 15 takes of Whole Lotta Love"
59:18;59:20;"And just, dad's like such a casual fan"
59:20;59:21;"Just like, oh!"
59:21;59:23;"Pretending to be interested in the booklet"
59:23;59:25;"Very cool!"
59:25;59:26;"Very cool"
59:26;59:29;"I think this year, it was just before Q4"
59:29;59:31;"The Dead put out a new box set"
59:31;59:34;"This is our way to really segue into Grateful's Giving"
59:34;59:36;"The Dead put out a new box set that's like"
59:36;59:38;"A many, many disc set of like"
59:38;59:40;"Performances at Giant Stadium"
59:40;59:42;"Maybe it's like every Giant Stadium show"
59:42;59:44;"Within a decade or something"
59:44;59:45;"I'm also just picturing like"
59:45;59:47;"Giving that to like a really casual"
59:47;59:49;"Like, Deadhead fan"
59:49;59:51;"It's like, oh, you know, I would have liked the greatest hits"
59:51;59:53;"[Laughs]"
59:53;59:55;"So it's like all 80s and 90s"
59:55;59:56;"I think so"
59:56;59:57;"That's rough"
59:57;59:58;"Now I feel bad"
59:58;01:00:00;"We're really making Seinfeld crunch a lot of numbers"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"Does somebody else wanna-"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"No, you know what, it's your job"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"I'm getting a little soft on Grateful's Giving"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Tell us about the new Grateful Dead box set"
01:00:08;01:00:09;"Now!"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"Let's get a number crunch!"
01:00:13;01:00:16;"Brought to you by Seinfeld 2000"
01:00:16;01:00:18;"Okay, according to JamBands.com"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"It encompasses shows from '87, '89, and '91"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"And it came out in September"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Peak period"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"How many- how many discs?"
01:00:28;01:00:29;"80 discs"
01:00:29;01:00:30;"No, no, no, sorry"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"That's 30 trips"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"No, there is one"
01:00:32;01:00:34;"30 trips around the sun was 80 discs"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"80?!"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"Yeah, in 2015"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"They're only making 10,000 of these"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"I like a limited edition CD"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"[Laughs]"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"It seems like this box set is 14 CDs"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"Plus a Blu-ray"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"Blu-ray"
01:00:47;01:00:50;"I think 'cause there's a video of one of the shows"
01:00:50;01:00:51;"I'd check it out"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"Wynton Marsalis, Eyes of the World"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"Oh yeah"
01:00:54;01:00:55;"He's played one of them"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"Oakland Coliseum or whatever"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"One of my favorite ball times"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"And that was probably like '91"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"Yeah, early '90s"
01:01:01;01:01:02;"That was a nice touch"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Well, we've been meaning to do something"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"On the show for a minute"
01:01:05;01:01:08;"And that's pay tribute to the great Robert Hunter"
01:01:08;01:01:12;"The dead lyricist who passed away a few months ago"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"It never quite was the right time on the show"
01:01:14;01:01:16;"And I think it kind of worked out well"
01:01:16;01:01:17;"'Cause we got Kyle here"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"And it's Grateful as a Gift"
01:01:18;01:01:20;"So now we can finally get into it"
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Robert Hunter tribute"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Well first, one thing I want to say"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"And you know, the past few episodes"
01:01:25;01:01:26;"I've been referencing Elton John a lot"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"Because I read his book"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"But as far as I know"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"And maybe you guys throw it out"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"If you can think of any others"
01:01:32;01:01:35;"There are two great lyricist-musician partnerships"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"Of the modern rock era"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"'Cause obviously Rodgers and Hammerstein"
01:01:40;01:01:42;"You know, people worked that way"
01:01:42;01:01:43;"In the Tin Pan Alley days"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"But that way of working"
01:01:44;01:01:47;"In the kind of Bob Dylan Beatles era"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"Seemed weirdly old-fashioned"
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Because, yeah, back in the day"
01:01:50;01:01:52;"You'd just be like, ""Well, I'm a lyricist"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"""And I can come up with a hot couplet"
01:01:54;01:01:55;"""For your new sheet music"""
01:01:55;01:01:57;"And then go, ""Well, I can write the chords"""
01:01:57;01:01:58;"That feels very old-timey"
01:01:58;01:02:00;"You had people who wrote songs together"
01:02:00;01:02:02;"And you met people where maybe"
01:02:02;01:02:04;"They both wrote lyrics or something"
01:02:04;01:02:05;"And even now in our era"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"I don't know anybody who's a pure lyricist"
01:02:08;01:02:09;"That'd be cool"
01:02:09;01:02:10;"Yeah, you hear a little bit about like Kanye"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"Having like some poets in the room and stuff"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"But even that's different"
01:02:14;01:02:15;"That's more like a writing workshop"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"And I think the most common way"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"That people work now"
01:02:18;01:02:19;"In a collaborative writing setting"
01:02:19;01:02:20;"Is more hip-hop"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"Where somebody produces the music"
01:02:22;01:02:24;"And then somebody writes the melody"
01:02:24;01:02:26;"And lyrics on top of it"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"And that makes a lot more sense too"
01:02:27;01:02:28;"If you're writing the melody and lyrics"
01:02:28;01:02:31;"But we're talking about a pure lyricist"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"A poet linking up with a songwriter"
01:02:33;01:02:34;"Which seems very difficult"
01:02:34;01:02:36;"Because then they have to"
01:02:36;01:02:37;"Yeah"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"Either you would have somebody"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"Write a whole song with just a melody"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"Or in the case of Elton John and Bernie Taupin"
01:02:42;01:02:45;"Bernie would just send him lyrics"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"So that's one, Elton John and Bernie Taupin"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"Then you have Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"Which also is like very unusual"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"Especially when you consider that"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"The lyrics of the dead and the music"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"They just seem so married"
01:02:56;01:02:57;"Yeah"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"There's no like fun contrast or something"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Where you're like"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"Well Jerry's this kind of dude"
01:03:00;01:03:02;"But then Robert brings this other edge"
01:03:02;01:03:03;"It's like the words and the music"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Sound like each other"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"I find when people who are very casual fans"
01:03:07;01:03:10;"Realize that like Jerry didn't write any lyrics"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"It can blow their minds a little bit"
01:03:11;01:03:13;"Of course any like real deadhead knows that"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"But I think other people"
01:03:14;01:03:16;"You see Jerry, you hear the way he plays guitar"
01:03:16;01:03:18;"You hear his voice"
01:03:18;01:03:19;"And it is kind of wild to be like"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"Wow, he didn't write those words"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"He had such a vibe with Robert Hunter"
01:03:24;01:03:26;"That he looks like he would have written those words"
01:03:26;01:03:28;"But they were just on the same wavelength"
01:03:28;01:03:30;"So it's a very unique relationship"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Childhood friends"
01:03:31;01:03:32;"Right"
01:03:32;01:03:33;"Grew up together"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Bay area"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"There was something in the water out there man"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Acid"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"Yeah, straight up acid"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"I did not know they grew up together"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"And I don't know how they came up with songs"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"Which came first"
01:03:43;01:03:44;"Or if they were just sitting in a room together"
01:03:44;01:03:45;"I don't either really"
01:03:45;01:03:46;"You know"
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Well we know for sure that Robert Hunter"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"Sometimes would just write a song as a poem"
01:03:51;01:03:52;"And give it to Jerry"
01:03:52;01:03:54;"So maybe there were other songs where Jerry's like"
01:03:54;01:03:55;"Oh, I'm working on this thing man"
01:03:55;01:03:56;"You got any ideas?"
01:03:56;01:03:58;"And maybe they sat down together"
01:03:58;01:03:59;"But you know we have this note here"
01:03:59;01:04:02;"That in 1970 on one single day in London"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"Robert Hunter with the help of a bottle of Retsina"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"Wrote Ripple, Broke Down Palace, and To Lay Me Down"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"So that makes me picture you just sitting there"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"With a notepad and just like"
01:04:10;01:04:13;"Ripple in still water"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"When there is no pebble tossed"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Just like no music"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"And then they might have been kind of"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"A, being between old traditional songs"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Which I think people were doing more back then"
01:04:23;01:04:26;"Oh, like he would write new lyrics over like an old song?"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"Yeah, cadence wise"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"Or like with Forever Young"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"Right"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"Which we learned"
01:04:34;01:04:36;"There's the Bob Dylan Forever Young"
01:04:36;01:04:37;"The Rod Stewart Forever Young"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"But then there's the old Irish song Forever Young"
01:04:40;01:04:44;"Which they both based those off of I think"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"May the something something"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"May the road rise up to meet you"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"And that's a good point"
01:04:48;01:04:49;"Because you would imagine"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Coming up playing in like bluegrass bands together"
01:04:52;01:04:56;"Robert Hunter and Jerry would have such a shared"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"Understanding of like the folk tradition"
01:04:59;01:05:00;"And the songwriting tradition"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"That it wouldn't be like"
01:05:02;01:05:03;"Robert just hand him some like wild sh*t"
01:05:03;01:05:04;"And Jerry's just like"
01:05:04;01:05:06;"I can't find the beat man"
01:05:06;01:05:08;"Like they both would have understood"
01:05:08;01:05:11;"The relationship between poetry and songwriting"
01:05:11;01:05:12;"Yeah"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"Well we should talk about some of our favorite"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"Robert Hunter lyrics as tribute"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"The only person that we asked about"
01:05:18;01:05:20;"Robert Hunter lyrics so far was Huey Lewis"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"I guess we could start off that way"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"This is the Sweet Chili Heat world premiere"
01:05:24;01:05:26;"Never before heard audio"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"From our legendary Huey Lewis interview"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"Here's Huey Lewis talking about his favorite dead song"
01:05:31;01:05:35;"Time Crisis"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"This is the Time Crisis Sweet Chili Heat"
01:05:38;01:05:40;"Sweet Chili Heat world premiere"
01:05:40;01:05:41;"Brought to you by Doritos"
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Sweet Chili Heat"
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Well, St. Stephen's pretty good"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"That might be my favorite dead tune"
01:05:47;01:05:48;"I have no idea what it's about"
01:05:48;01:05:49;"Right"
01:05:49;01:05:50;"But I love it"
01:05:50;01:05:53;"And you know, Hunter was an amazing guy"
01:05:53;01:05:55;"I never really knew him"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"But we were gonna write a song together"
01:05:57;01:05:58;"Like he was gonna write lyrics?"
01:05:58;01:05:59;"Yeah"
01:05:59;01:06:00;"For you?"
01:06:00;01:06:01;"Oh wow"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"We never got it done"
01:06:02;01:06:03;"It was just recently"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"Because I have a new lawyer who represented him"
01:06:05;01:06:08;"And she said, wow he's keen to write"
01:06:08;01:06:09;"I said, really?"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"I said, wow that'd be cool"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"And we never got it done"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"But St. Stephen, that's your favorite?"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"I think so"
01:06:16;01:06:19;"St. Stephen with a rose"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"In and out of the garden he goes"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"Country garland in the wind"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"And the rain wherever he goes"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"The people all complain"
01:06:27;01:06:30;"Stephen Rothford in his time"
01:06:30;01:06:32;"Well he may and it may decline"
01:06:32;01:06:35;"Get it? Matter doesn't now"
01:06:35;01:06:38;"Stephen would pass as if he only knew how"
01:06:38;01:06:51;"[Guitar solo]"
01:06:51;01:06:54;"Wishing well with the golden bell"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"Bucket hanging clear to bow"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Hell I pray it's now and then"
01:06:59;01:07:02;"Stephen fill it up and lower down"
01:07:02;01:07:05;"And lower down again"
01:07:05;01:07:07;"So Kyle, what about you, man?"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"You're a big deadhead"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"Tough to pick a favorite"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"And Kyle's an incredible lyricist in his own right"
01:07:12;01:07:13;"That's true"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"I do a little bit of pen work"
01:07:14;01:07:16;"But I mean, come on, these guys are in the class"
01:07:16;01:07:17;"Hall they're on"
01:07:17;01:07:21;"Let's not cross T's and dot I's just yet"
01:07:21;01:07:24;"I would say he's gone"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Is it about Pigpen?"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"It's about Mickey Hart's dad"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"Oh right"
01:07:28;01:07:29;"Absconding with the bread"
01:07:29;01:07:32;"Yeah, that's kind of a classic time crisis, ref"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Because we always like to imagine"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"What that conversation was actually like"
01:07:36;01:07:38;"When the rest of the band found out that their manager"
01:07:38;01:07:39;"Mickey Hart's father"
01:07:39;01:07:40;"Yeah"
01:07:40;01:07:41;"Had absconded with the bread"
01:07:41;01:07:43;"And there's a bunch of hippies kind of vibes"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"But you know, still, man"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"He's gone? Are you serious?"
01:07:46;01:07:47;"He's gone"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"Hunter just in the corner just like"
01:07:49;01:07:51;"Hey Jerry, let's turn those lemons into lemonade, man"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Rat in a drain ditch?"
01:07:53;01:07:57;"Do you think they were calling Mickey Hart's dad a rat in a drain ditch?"
01:07:57;01:07:58;"That's what I'm wondering"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"I always thought they just saw"
01:08:00;01:08:03;"Like he saw a rat in a drain ditch"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"And I always thought it was about someone's death"
01:08:05;01:08:07;"And not about someone's leaving"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"Well yeah, it works that, I mean"
01:08:09;01:08:12;"I think people have at times changed the meaning"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"In fact, I think it was like the night after"
01:08:14;01:08:16;"Or the day that Bob Marley died"
01:08:16;01:08:17;"The Dead were playing the show"
01:08:17;01:08:19;"And they dropped a ""He's gone"""
01:08:19;01:08:21;"And I've read like accounts of it"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Where people were like"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"That was a cathartic moment, man"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"The Dead, because you know"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"The Dead obviously would have been huge Marley fans"
01:08:27;01:08:28;"And they're like, ""He's gone"""
01:08:28;01:08:30;"But then you like pause for a second"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"And you're just like, ""Rat in a drain ditch?"""
01:08:32;01:08:34;"Cat on a tin roof"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"But it is vaudeville after all"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"So it has to have interesting lyrics"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"And the transcendence of their songs"
01:08:41;01:08:45;"Is that they can take on so many meanings over the years"
01:08:45;01:08:47;"And the fact that like"
01:08:47;01:08:49;"They are one of the bands that"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"I feel like I learned from the Dead"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"When I first got into Live Dead"
01:08:52;01:08:55;"I was like, ""They kind of play the same songs like all the time"""
01:08:55;01:08:57;"Like they play ""He's gone"" a lot, a lot"
01:08:57;01:08:59;"And then you're like, ""Oh"""
01:08:59;01:09:03;"They're just really into continuing to play these songs over the years"
01:09:03;01:09:07;"And they keep developing in meaning and depth for them too"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"And the audience"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"They're not like moving on"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Well, they're letting it mutate and breathe"
01:09:12;01:09:13;"This is a great call, Kyle"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"Just purely in terms of lyrics"
01:09:15;01:09:19;"I feel like Robert Hunter sometimes had this role in the Dead constellation"
01:09:19;01:09:21;"Where he was a member of the band"
01:09:21;01:09:23;"In the sense that he's this key songwriting dude"
01:09:23;01:09:25;"But he also stood outside the group"
01:09:25;01:09:26;"Was it in the band photos?"
01:09:26;01:09:29;"And like Chip of Fools is famously like"
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Him kind of commenting on like"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"How big the posse had got"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"And got a little out of hand"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"And all these like druggies on the road"
01:09:36;01:09:37;"So even this one is kind of like"
01:09:37;01:09:40;"What's the Breddy Snellis line about Huey?"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Oh, um"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Huey had a more cynical and bitter sense of humor"
01:09:43;01:09:44;"Yeah, this is"
01:09:44;01:09:45;"Than Elvis Costello did"
01:09:45;01:09:46;"I think there's something funny"
01:09:46;01:09:48;"Because the Dead, obviously a lot of people would be like"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"""Oh, they're hippies, it's all good"""
01:09:49;01:09:52;"But Robert Hunter has a cynical and bitter sense of humor"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"This is one of their most famous beloved songs"
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Is about a crook"
01:09:56;01:09:58;"A real crook who ripped them off"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"You know better than I know him"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"Robert Hunter, he saw it"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"God is gone"
01:10:05;01:10:08;"He's gone"
01:10:08;01:10:17;"Like a sweet locomotive"
01:10:17;01:10:20;"Rolling down the track"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"He's gone, he's gone"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"And nothing's gonna bring him back"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"He's gone"
01:10:31;01:10:33;"It's interesting Kyle that you said vaudeville"
01:10:33;01:10:35;"Because there is an element of that"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"Some of the music and a lot of the lyrics"
01:10:37;01:10:40;"That's like, I guess it's like the old weird America"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"That people talk about"
01:10:41;01:10:44;"And they were on the verge of beats and hippies"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"Like they were pre-hippie"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"A little bit older"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"Yeah, they were a little bit older"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"So they were like, they talked about it"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"Yeah, that it was still not a thing"
01:10:53;01:10:57;"They like thinking about like the 1890s and the 20s"
01:10:57;01:11:00;"Yeah, and there's something kind of cool too"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"Maybe a positive framework to look at the world now"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"But it's like early 70s"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Your manager steals your money"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"And then it kind of reframe it almost like"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"He's a vaudeville villain"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"You know, just like"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Yeah, he's got like a weird mustache"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"And he absconded with the bread"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Like, oh that crook"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"And what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"Like they're not gonna quit"
01:11:21;01:11:24;"Kind of the way that they're just built into this tradition"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"It's like"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"Yeah, like scars"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"
01:11:30;01:11:31;"And I also think"
01:11:31;01:11:32;"There's probably a little bit of that"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"Like tapping into the old weird America"
01:11:34;01:11:35;"Bob Dylan did it too"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"That kind of made touring for them"
01:11:37;01:11:40;"A little more mythical and mystical"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"Cause like, even when you picture like these"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Like legendary dead shows"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Like Veneta, Oregon and Europe 72"
01:11:46;01:11:49;"I picture it almost existing in this alternate universe"
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Cause it's also like 1972 Europe"
01:11:51;01:11:53;"It's the f***ing 70s"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"It's like dark and weird"
01:11:55;01:11:56;"It's not exactly like"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"It probably was like a bit of a s*** adventure"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"The way that going to Europe now is kind of a s*** adventure"
01:12:01;01:12:03;"But they framed it as a little bit like"
01:12:03;01:12:06;"We're a roving band of performers, man"
01:12:06;01:12:10;"Just like out there encountering all manner of rogues"
01:12:10;01:12:11;"And villains"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"You know, it's like a cool way to look at it"
01:12:13;01:12:14;"For sure"
01:12:14;01:12:15;"And they were self-contained"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"I mean, I think there was like 30 of them"
01:12:18;01:12:19;"When they went over there"
01:12:19;01:12:20;"Really?"
01:12:20;01:12:21;"Or 18"
01:12:21;01:12:22;"They brought wives, girlfriends"
01:12:22;01:12:23;"Huge, huge, yeah"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"Like so many people on a bus"
01:12:24;01:12:25;"Caravan"
01:12:25;01:12:28;"And doing so many substances"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"So they were on a trip"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"And I guess that's the original Jack Kerouac thing"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Who was kind of like so appealing to all these guys"
01:12:34;01:12:35;"Yeah"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"Even in the 40s and 50s when he was doing it"
01:12:37;01:12:39;"It still probably kind of sucked"
01:12:39;01:12:41;"I'm sure it was like a little more interesting than today"
01:12:41;01:12:45;"But like to frame that as like a true cosmic adventure"
01:12:45;01:12:46;"Yeah, just like"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"Sorry to keep being the narcotics drug whisperer"
01:12:48;01:12:52;"But I think the Benzedrine didn't hurt either"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"Like Neil Cassidy, Jack Kerouac"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"They were doing a lot of speed"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"Drugs is a great way to reframe the mundane"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"Totally"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"I mean, we're not saying that"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"But that's what they were saying"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Well yeah, just sitting in like a metal box"
01:13:06;01:13:09;"For like 18 hours a day"
01:13:09;01:13:10;"Cosmic, man"
01:13:10;01:13:11;"You know what, man"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"I think we're continuing the tradition here on Time Crisis"
01:13:14;01:13:15;"Little mimosa here"
01:13:15;01:13:16;"Little mimosa"
01:13:16;01:13:20;"Just trying to reframe the brutal landscape into something"
01:13:20;01:13:24;"Somewhere in the country, Carl's Jr.'s become Hardee's"
01:13:24;01:13:25;"Yeah"
01:13:25;01:13:26;"Just like picturing like a Kerouac"
01:13:26;01:13:30;"I watched Carl's Jr.'s fade into Hardee's"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"Across the rough mountains"
01:13:33;01:13:35;"The perfect way"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"The golden plains"
01:13:39;01:13:40;"A golden corral"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And then we got there and turned around"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"And watched the Hardee's turn back into Carl's Jr."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Like on the road and we were just like"
01:13:46;01:13:47;"And then we drove all the way there"
01:13:47;01:13:48;"And then we drove back"
01:13:48;01:13:49;"Like immediately"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"Back and forth from Hardee's"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"Into Carl's Jr.'s"
01:13:53;01:13:54;"And back into Hardee's"
01:13:54;01:13:58;"We traversed the cosmic terrain of America"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Maybe go full North America"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"Actually, I feel like in some of the beat novels"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"People ended up in Mexico"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"William S. Burroughs, infamously"
01:14:05;01:14:07;"The Tim Hortons of the North"
01:14:07;01:14:09;"Into the Star Fox"
01:14:09;01:14:12;"And back into the Tim Hortons of Mexico"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"I think the openness of the lyrics"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"That you could interpret them in so many different ways"
01:14:17;01:14:21;"Using those very classic, you know, a train"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"Seemed boring to me, actually"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"When I first discovered The Grateful Dead"
01:14:25;01:14:26;"When I was like 15, I was just like"
01:14:26;01:14:27;"It wasn't like specific enough"
01:14:27;01:14:28;"What are you talking about?"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"Like how does this lightning bolt"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"This cool lightning bolt face"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"Equal this?"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Like I thought the music was gonna be way weirder"
01:14:36;01:14:37;"I kind of felt the same way"
01:14:37;01:14:40;"Like maybe a little more Pink Floyd"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"Or even a little more Led Zeppelin"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"In the darkest depths of Mordor"
01:14:44;01:14:45;"Yeah"
01:14:45;01:14:46;"And Gollum, the evil one!"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"Yeah"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"But that's the thing"
01:14:48;01:14:49;"If The Dead had gone full Lord of the Rings"
01:14:49;01:14:51;"It would be f***ing lame"
01:14:51;01:14:52;"There's also something interesting"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"I guess like you said"
01:14:53;01:14:54;"You can interpret it so many ways"
01:14:54;01:14:55;"I think more than any other band"
01:14:55;01:14:58;"Maybe because of the fervor of their fans"
01:14:58;01:14:59;"They have all these lines"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"That get decontextualized from the lyrics"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"And just become something else"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"Where I grew up in New Jersey"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"Spent a little time on a mountain"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"Spent a little time on a hill"
01:15:09;01:15:10;"Things went down"
01:15:10;01:15:11;"What is it that we didn't understand"
01:15:11;01:15:12;"But I guess in time we will?"
01:15:12;01:15:13;"Something like that?"
01:15:13;01:15:14;"Yeah"
01:15:14;01:15:16;"That was such a classic yearbook quote"
01:15:16;01:15:17;"Oh yeah"
01:15:17;01:15:18;"Maybe there is something"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"About those Dead lyrics"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"That you can just pull a little bit out"
01:15:22;01:15:23;"And just kind of"
01:15:23;01:15:25;"Make you feel about a trip you took"
01:15:25;01:15:27;"Or some moment in your life"
01:15:27;01:15:28;"Like just two lines from a song"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"Would go on a parking lot shirt"
01:15:30;01:15:31;"Right?"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"Like ""Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile"""
01:15:33;01:15:34;"Yeah, it's interesting that"
01:15:34;01:15:35;"Both ""Steal your face"""
01:15:35;01:15:37;"And ""Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile"""
01:15:37;01:15:40;"Come out of songs about getting ripped off"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"The same song"
01:15:41;01:15:42;"The same song?"
01:15:42;01:15:43;"Yeah"
01:15:43;01:15:44;"The same song"
01:15:44;01:15:45;"That you're getting your bread absconded with"
01:15:45;01:15:47;"Jake, what's one of your favorite songs?"
01:15:47;01:15:48;"Well I was just going to say"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"Even when Hunter went super trippy"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"Like Borderline Zeppelin"
01:15:51;01:15:52;"Yeah"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"Like in Darkstar"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"It's still"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"I feel like that's your favorite"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"It's not as goofy"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"That's one of your favorites to quote"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"I can picture you singing"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"""Lady Finger"""
01:16:01;01:16:02;"Oh no, that's St. Stephen"
01:16:02;01:16:03;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Oh this is the transitive nightfall of"
01:16:04;01:16:05;"Darkstar crashes"
01:16:05;01:16:07;"Pouring its light into ashes"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"That's already like"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"So much more interesting"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"Than singing about Gollum"
01:16:11;01:16:12;"Well there's also some"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"Reason tatters"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"The forces tear loose from the axis"
01:16:15;01:16:18;"It is kind of like nonsensical trippy stuff"
01:16:18;01:16:19;"But it's like"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Grounded in like"
01:16:21;01:16:25;"There's a dark star of just like"
01:16:25;01:16:28;"Cold ash spinning in the cosmos"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"Well also"
01:16:29;01:16:30;"That is so heavy"
01:16:30;01:16:31;"I remember"
01:16:31;01:16:33;"Because the dead loom's so large"
01:16:33;01:16:36;"When you grow up in certain parts of the country"
01:16:36;01:16:37;"And like classic rock"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"You'd be familiar with some of the song names"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"And lyrics before you even heard it"
01:16:41;01:16:42;"Like even just an 8 year old kid"
01:16:42;01:16:44;"Just seeing somebody just being like"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"Like you said, picturing how the music would sound"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"You already had this idea that it might be"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"A little more Pink Floyd or Zeppelin"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"And then I remember specifically"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Hearing about the song ""Darkstar"""
01:16:54;01:16:55;"And people talking about"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"Well that was a very special dead song"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"And they went years without playing it"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"And it's so epic"
01:17:00;01:17:01;"And then I remember like"
01:17:01;01:17:02;"When I finally heard it"
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Like it's not dark"
01:17:03;01:17:05;"You know they have some versions"
01:17:05;01:17:07;"Where they get so trippy live"
01:17:07;01:17:09;"That it gets a little more out there"
01:17:09;01:17:11;"And the way Jerry sings those lines"
01:17:11;01:17:12;"Is so like"
01:17:12;01:17:13;"It's more like"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"You know the big cosmic joke or something"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"You know like there's a sense of humor or something"
01:17:17;01:17:19;"Well it's really like sweet"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"The melody he wrote"
01:17:21;01:17:26;"Moon or shadows"
01:17:26;01:17:31;"Or misrefunctions in the night"
01:17:31;01:17:36;"Lost and disappointed"
01:17:36;01:17:41;"Or ice and flowers withering"
01:17:41;01:17:46;"Lady and Elmer"
01:17:46;01:17:51;"Receipts in the nights of goodbye"
01:17:51;01:17:54;"Shall we go"
01:17:54;01:17:58;"You and I while we can"
01:18:02;01:18:09;"The heart traps into nightfall"
01:18:09;01:18:15;"The heart traps into nightfall"
01:18:15;01:18:17;"So Hunter's favorite lyrics"
01:18:17;01:18:18;"That he ever wrote"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"Were from the song ""Ripple"""
01:18:20;01:18:21;"Oh classic"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"It's almost like if you're a super deadhead"
01:18:22;01:18:23;"It's almost like ""Ripple"" is like"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"Too basic"
01:18:24;01:18:25;"Kinda basic"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"I mean the song is gorgeous"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"But he said his favorite verse he ever wrote was"
01:18:29;01:18:32;"Reach out your hand if your cup be empty"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"If your cup is full may it be again"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"Let it be known there is a fountain"
01:18:36;01:18:39;"That was not made by the hands of men"
01:18:39;01:18:41;"And then also the chorus which is"
01:18:41;01:18:43;"You said earlier ripple in still water"
01:18:43;01:18:44;"But with no pebble tossed"
01:18:44;01:18:45;"Very zen"
01:18:45;01:18:46;"I think the vibe is like"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"If there's no pebble tossed"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"And there's no wind rippling the water"
01:18:50;01:18:51;"Yeah"
01:18:51;01:18:52;"There's still a spontaneous ripple"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"Like sort of like"
01:18:53;01:18:55;"The mystery of like creativity"
01:18:55;01:18:57;"The cosmos"
01:18:57;01:18:58;"The big bang"
01:18:58;01:18:59;"Whatever you believe"
01:18:59;01:19:00;"Right"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"Like sort of spontaneous creation"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"Coming from nothing"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"Being open to a logic beyond"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"The basic logic that we see right in front of us"
01:19:09;01:19:10;"Yes"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"Obviously a ripple would require pebble tossed"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"Just Cherry being like"
01:19:14;01:19:15;"Robert"
01:19:15;01:19:16;"If there's no pebble tossed"
01:19:16;01:19:17;"There wouldn't be a ripple"
01:19:17;01:19:19;"Can we change it to ripple in still water"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Because the pebble was tossed"
01:19:21;01:19:23;"No man"
01:19:23;01:19:24;"Logic doesn't track"
01:19:24;01:19:25;"Once again"
01:19:25;01:19:26;"It's not one"
01:19:26;01:19:27;"Hmm"
01:19:27;01:19:28;"I'm gonna distort"
01:19:28;01:19:29;"Uncle Kyle"
01:19:29;01:19:30;"Sometimes visually"
01:19:30;01:19:31;"You're on drugs"
01:19:31;01:19:39;"Perhaps they're better left unsung"
01:19:39;01:19:42;"I don't know"
01:19:42;01:19:47;"Don't really care"
01:19:47;01:19:51;"Let there be songs"
01:19:51;01:19:54;"To fill the air"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"And also so positive"
01:19:56;01:19:57;"Yeah"
01:19:57;01:19:58;"Not in a cloying way"
01:19:58;01:20:01;"Although a hater maybe would describe it as cloying"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"But the idea that"
01:20:03;01:20:04;"Yeah maybe your cup's not full right now"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"But I hope it is again"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"I feel like that's the deadhead philosophy"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"Totally"
01:20:09;01:20:10;"Which was probably Kerouacian too"
01:20:10;01:20:11;"Of like"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"You win some you lose some"
01:20:13;01:20:14;"But don't give up"
01:20:14;01:20:15;"If it"
01:20:15;01:20:17;"That's not too over simplistic"
01:20:17;01:20:18;"I think in this song too"
01:20:18;01:20:19;"It's sort of like"
01:20:19;01:20:20;"There is a strain of like"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"There's an individual artist"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Who's writing this music"
01:20:23;01:20:24;"But the song is more about"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"That we're all part of a continuum"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"That like if your song is unsung"
01:20:28;01:20:29;"May it be sung again"
01:20:29;01:20:30;"Hmm"
01:20:30;01:20:31;"It's sort of like this weird thing of like"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"We're alone but we're actually all together"
01:20:33;01:20:34;"Which is very dead"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"This is one of the more like"
01:20:36;01:20:39;"Straightforwardly beautiful dead songs"
01:20:39;01:20:41;"Ripple is a pretty common word"
01:20:41;01:20:42;"But it's like"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"The dead really just like own the word ripple"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Yeah"
01:20:45;01:20:49;"Simple highway"
01:20:49;01:20:52;"Between the dawn"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"And the dark of night"
01:20:55;01:20:59;"And if you go"
01:20:59;01:21:04;"No one may follow"
01:21:04;01:21:08;"That path is far"
01:21:08;01:21:11;"Your steps alone"
01:21:11;01:21:13;"Wasn't ripple a kind of wine too?"
01:21:13;01:21:14;"I don't know"
01:21:14;01:21:15;"I wonder if"
01:21:15;01:21:17;"It was like a hobo reference"
01:21:17;01:21:18;"Oh right"
01:21:18;01:21:19;"Like ripple and still water"
01:21:19;01:21:20;"Yeah hobos"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"That's that old weird America"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"Yeah I wonder"
01:21:23;01:21:24;"So if he wrote this"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"On that same day in 1970"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"If he just handed this poem to Jerry"
01:21:28;01:21:29;"Hmm"
01:21:29;01:21:30;"And then he just wrote this like"
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Beautiful music"
01:21:31;01:21:32;"It's crazy"
01:21:32;01:21:36;"To lead must follow"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"But if you fall"
01:21:39;01:21:42;"You fall alone"
01:21:42;01:21:46;"If you should stand"
01:21:46;01:21:57;"Then who's to guide you? If I knew the way, I would take you home."
01:22:05;01:22:29;"- One of the songs that I picked thinking about this day,"
01:22:29;01:22:32;"the single day in London when Robert Hunter wrote"
01:22:32;01:22:33;"all those songs, and I'm thinking about this"
01:22:33;01:22:35;"'cause right now Jake, you're wearing the"
01:22:35;01:22:39;"Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures shirt that Kyle designed."
01:22:39;01:22:41;"We gotta do another shirt together Kyle"
01:22:41;01:22:43;"because that's a real classic grail"
01:22:43;01:22:47;"is Kyle's hand drawn Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"Ohai shirt."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"That one Ohai shirt produced a lot of classic merch."
01:22:50;01:22:51;"So this is a real great one."
01:22:51;01:22:53;"The blue, red and white one."
01:22:53;01:22:56;"- Highway 33, kind of Shel Silverstein-esque."
01:22:56;01:22:58;"- It's a beautiful shirt."
01:22:58;01:23:02;"And I have one that I wear from time to time."
01:23:02;01:23:05;"And I think I sent you a picture of this Jake."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"I gotta be honest, I can't remember if it was that shirt"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"or another one from Ohai,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"but it's making me think of the Ohai shirts."
01:23:10;01:23:15;"Last year, I went to London to go meet with a lot"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"of the people from Columbia and Sony to play them the record."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"We kind of had like a get together and people came"
01:23:20;01:23:23;"from all the different countries and got to hang out"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"and kind of give them a taste of the records"
01:23:25;01:23:26;"they could start planning."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"And then I remember I was there with Michael Schmeling,"
01:23:30;01:23:33;"the photographer, and he was filming some of the trip."
01:23:33;01:23:36;"And then we thought, well, why not try to get some pictures?"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"You always need press shots."
01:23:38;01:23:39;"So like, all right, cool."
01:23:39;01:23:40;"Walk around London."
01:23:40;01:23:41;"So we were walking around London."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"There's a few pictures out there wearing like this blue"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"jacket and some sandals."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"And there's like just some, we got some useful pictures"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"that we've like sent out here and there."
01:23:50;01:23:51;"And then just at one point,"
01:23:51;01:23:53;"it was a beautiful day in London."
01:23:53;01:23:56;"And London's such a pleasant city to walk around"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"because you have these big squares everywhere."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"I don't know what exactly what they call them."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"In New York, you would call it a park"
01:24:03;01:24:05;"'cause you're so desperate just to have parks around."
01:24:05;01:24:08;"But it's almost like if you had a Washington Square Park"
01:24:08;01:24:11;"times 100, if like three blocks away, there's another one."
01:24:11;01:24:13;"And just a place that's like, that's your local spot"
01:24:13;01:24:15;"where you can go sit on a bench."
01:24:15;01:24:18;"If it's a nice day, you could maybe have a drink"
01:24:18;01:24:19;"with some friends, you could get some work done"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"or something, but just a really pleasant way"
01:24:22;01:24:23;"to like green the city."
01:24:23;01:24:25;"And also it would help, you know, you can cut through"
01:24:25;01:24:28;"if you're going diagonally, even if you're not stopping,"
01:24:28;01:24:29;"it still can be very pleasant."
01:24:29;01:24:32;"So I was walking through the one where the big US embassy is"
01:24:32;01:24:35;"and then I realized I'm in Gravenor Square"
01:24:35;01:24:36;"and I'm wearing a Richard Pictures shirt"
01:24:36;01:24:40;"and Gravenor Square is where Scarlet Begonias takes place."
01:24:40;01:24:42;"I might be pronouncing it somewhat incorrectly."
01:24:42;01:24:44;"It's one of those weird UK words."
01:24:44;01:24:47;"- Yep, like Lauchdister or like stirrer."
01:24:47;01:24:49;"- It's written like Gravenor."
01:24:49;01:24:52;"So it's this big square and there's this huge,"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"I think it's moving, but for a long time,"
01:24:54;01:24:57;"the gigantic imposing US embassy is there."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"It's a mid-century building,"
01:24:58;01:25:02;"has this like giant eagle up front, kind of a harsh vibe,"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"but then you have like a very pleasant square."
01:25:04;01:25:05;"And then I was like, oh cool."
01:25:05;01:25:07;"And I think I sent you a picture that Michael took"
01:25:07;01:25:09;"where I'm just kind of showing off my Richard Pictures shirt"
01:25:09;01:25:11;"underneath the sign that says Gravenor Square."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"- That's right."
01:25:12;01:25:13;"- So then I'm thinking about Scarlet Begonias,"
01:25:13;01:25:16;"very classic Dead song, but then I was thinking,"
01:25:16;01:25:19;"is it Dead quintessentially American band?"
01:25:19;01:25:20;"Is this the only song that we can say"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"definitely takes place in Europe?"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"(laughing)"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"I just love that Scarlet Begonias takes place in England."
01:25:27;01:25:30;"♪ I was walking 'round Gravenor Square ♪"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- I never knew that."

01:25:58;01:25:59;"Scarlet Begonias. - Wearing a flower crown?"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"- Yeah."
01:26:00;01:26:01;"- Before Coachella."
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- British fan."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"- Yeah, maybe it was a fan."

01:26:26;01:26:27;"- Is that like Slim Shoes?"
01:26:27;01:26:31;"- Yeah, that's the Eminem version."
01:26:31;01:26:32;"- It's called Bob."
01:26:32;01:26:33;"- Bob."
01:26:33;01:26:34;"- Bob Hunter."
01:26:34;01:26:35;"His name was Bob Hunter too."
01:26:35;01:26:38;"- Oh, right, see, and I thought that it was Jerry"
01:26:38;01:26:39;"that saw the girl."
01:26:39;01:26:41;"No, it was--"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"- Yep, the writer."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"- The underground with his like fedora on"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"and glasses just--"
01:26:46;01:26:47;"- Right."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- And this is also the type of story"
01:26:48;01:26:49;"where you could also imagine,"
01:26:49;01:26:51;"maybe if he was on drugs, you're like, did this happen?"
01:26:51;01:26:52;"Here's a version."
01:26:52;01:26:55;"Bob Hunter, I don't know if he was particularly druggy,"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"but just for the sake of the story,"
01:26:57;01:26:59;"let's imagine he's vibing out."
01:26:59;01:27:00;"He's at least a little high,"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"and he's just like in an altered state of mind."
01:27:02;01:27:03;"He's sitting there in Gravenor Square."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"He's like, whoa, man, this is trippy."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"Just a little Bay Area boy."
01:27:07;01:27:09;"What am I doing out here in London?"
01:27:09;01:27:11;"Then he looks over and he's just like, ooh, harsh."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Big US embassy."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Bad vibe."
01:27:14;01:27:16;"Now he's thinking about like the war in Vietnam"
01:27:16;01:27:19;"and stuff, just like American imperialism."
01:27:19;01:27:23;"It's just like imposing symbol of the US empire."
01:27:23;01:27:25;"He's like, ugh, man, bad vibe."
01:27:25;01:27:27;"And then he sees this mystical woman"
01:27:27;01:27:30;"just walking through the square in the distance"
01:27:30;01:27:33;"with flowers in her hair, rings on her finger,"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"bells on her shoes."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"Yeah, he's just like looking at that (beep)"
01:27:36;01:27:38;"just like, oh man."
01:27:38;01:27:39;"- She's like a Renaissance fairy."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"- And then you just hear like, ding, ding, ding, ding,"
01:27:41;01:27:42;"and then my favorite part,"
01:27:42;01:27:45;"and I knew without asking she was into the blues."
01:27:45;01:27:48;"- I know, that's 'cause he needed to rhyme it with shoes."
01:27:48;01:27:49;"- Well, although that's--"
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- Could've been bells on her toes,"
01:27:51;01:27:54;"I knew she was into the shows."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"Knew without asking she was into the shows."
01:27:56;01:27:59;"- I knew right, she had bells on her toes."
01:27:59;01:28:02;"I knew right away she was into our shows."
01:28:02;01:28:04;"(laughing)"
01:28:04;01:28:07;"Wait, she had rings on her finger and bells on her head."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"I knew without asking she was into the dead."
01:28:09;01:28:10;"(laughing)"
01:28:10;01:28:11;"- But I think he decoded it."
01:28:11;01:28:13;"- And he's like, you look like you're into the dead."
01:28:13;01:28:15;"You know, I read a few of their songs."
01:28:15;01:28:16;"(laughing)"
01:28:16;01:28:17;"- Bob Hunter, nice to meet you."
01:28:17;01:28:20;"- But how they were so into Victorian times,"
01:28:20;01:28:23;"he saw his first real Renaissance fair person."
01:28:23;01:28:24;"- Yeah, right."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"- That's what Scarlett Begonia's is."
01:28:25;01:28:25;"That was Jake's decoding."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- Oh, I like that, I like that."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Yeah, because--"
01:28:27;01:28:29;"- She was headed to a Ren Fair like--"
01:28:29;01:28:29;"- Well, and also--"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"- She was real into Fairport Convention also,"
01:28:32;01:28:33;"into that sort of like--"
01:28:33;01:28:33;"- For sure."
01:28:33;01:28:36;"- Cold British folk rock, but also down with the dead."
01:28:36;01:28:37;"- I love this."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"Hold on, I wanna get the lyrics up for real."
01:28:39;01:28:40;"How 'bout this?"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"Bob Hunter, American poet,"
01:28:43;01:28:45;"American painter and poet."
01:28:45;01:28:47;"He and Jerry, you know, their first love was like"
01:28:47;01:28:50;"bluegrass, folk music, the blues."
01:28:50;01:28:53;"These are the guys who would 100% know the words"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"to some obscure English order ballad."
01:28:56;01:28:56;"- Yep."
01:28:56;01:28:58;"- You know, from the depths of the past."
01:28:58;01:29:01;"And by the way, you know, like a lot of songwriters"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"of that era, they loved the blues"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"and they loved English, Western European folk music"
01:29:05;01:29:07;"and not because those things are so different,"
01:29:07;01:29:09;"because they understood the connections"
01:29:09;01:29:10;"between all those music."
01:29:10;01:29:13;"They could understand it in, you know,"
01:29:13;01:29:16;"Robert Johnson's storytelling, how that intersected"
01:29:16;01:29:19;"with like some weird old murder ballad from England."
01:29:19;01:29:23;"So probably in a way, for these guys to be touring Europe,"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"probably felt like very meaningful."
01:29:24;01:29:26;"I felt that a little way, like the first time"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"I really went to England as an adult,"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"because there's a part of me, you know,"
01:29:29;01:29:32;"growing up in New Jersey and like being obsessed"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"with like the Kinks and Ray Davies and, you know,"
01:29:34;01:29:36;"and English music and English folk music,"
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Fairport Convention, Steel Eyes Spent."
01:29:38;01:29:40;"I think a lot of Americans have this vision"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"of the UK, when you get there, you're just like,"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"whoa, this is like the land of folk music and whatever."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"And then of course you realize, wow, it has so much,"
01:29:47;01:29:49;"they have their trash culture, just like the US"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"and they have their tabloids"
01:29:50;01:29:52;"and they have their McDonald's and stuff."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"But you can imagine that maybe Bob Hunter,"
01:29:54;01:29:57;"for him as a poet, he's in the land of Wordsworth"
01:29:57;01:30:01;"or whatever, and there he is sitting in Gravenor Square"
01:30:01;01:30:02;"and maybe he's a little bit let down."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"It's kind of like, there's a nip to the air."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"So again, a little cold."
01:30:06;01:30:09;"And he's just like sitting in front of the US embassy."
01:30:09;01:30:10;"My whole story is gonna fall apart"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"if the US embassy wasn't there in the early seventies,"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"but let's hope."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"And he's looking at the US embassy, just like, bummer, man."
01:30:16;01:30:18;"Here, I thought I was about to step into the land."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"- Bummer, man."
01:30:19;01:30:21;"- I was about to step into the land of Mordor."
01:30:21;01:30:24;"And then he has a vision of the personification"
01:30:24;01:30:25;"of English folk music."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"A Ren Faire person come to life."
01:30:28;01:30:30;"And the reason that she was into the blues"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"is because she's like the muse,"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"like a fairy form of English folk music."
01:30:36;01:30:37;"And if you could ask English folk music,"
01:30:37;01:30:38;"what do you think of the blues?"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"They'd say, ""Well, that's my cousin, man."
01:30:40;01:30:41;"""And I love the blues."
01:30:41;01:30:45;"""We're all from the same Afro-European folk tradition."""
01:30:45;01:30:46;"So maybe that's who she is."
01:30:46;01:30:47;"She wasn't real."
01:30:47;01:30:49;"- He's tripping, dude."
01:30:49;01:30:50;"I wonder though."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"I mean, for a Ren Faire, that would be on point, no big deal."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"- But there wouldn't have been a Ren Faire just,"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"well, I guess there could have been in the heart of."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"- And they probably didn't call it a Renaissance Faire."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"It was probably like a pleasure fair."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"They didn't have the need for the word Renaissance."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"It was just a solstice."
01:31:05;01:31:06;"- The fall harvest."
01:31:06;01:31:11;"- He was there June 21st, 1970, just like summer solstice."

01:43:00;01:43:01;"And they're just like, ""Go in that room."""

01:43:07;01:43:09;"That's what it really means to be hauling items."
01:43:09;01:43:11;"Is when you have no idea what's in the truck."

01:43:13;01:43:14;"- For sure."

01:43:26;01:43:28;"So he was on his way back."

01:43:38;01:43:39;"""I'll tip over."""
01:43:39;01:43:40;"- Yeah."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"- Like if it's light, it's just a sail."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"- Trucking is a real wild job."

01:44:02;01:44:05;"- Too bad Bob's not around to write those songs."
01:44:05;01:44:06;"- I'm pretty confident that he and Jerry"

01:44:09;01:44:10;"if they were still with us."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"- Yeah, for sure."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"- I mean, we talked on this show about the days between"
01:44:14;01:44:15;"one of their last songs they wrote."
01:44:15;01:44:18;"Never did a studio recording, but still a good song."
01:44:18;01:44:18;"- Oh yeah."
01:44:18;01:44:20;"- They were in their 50s."
01:44:20;01:44:21;"- But doesn't sound that far away."
01:44:21;01:44:22;"- Well, now."
01:44:22;01:44:23;"- They're in their 50s."
01:44:23;01:44:24;"- Getting close."
01:44:24;01:44:26;"- I'm three years away."
01:44:26;01:44:27;"- From your 50s?"
01:44:27;01:44:29;"- Yeah, from my 50."
01:44:29;01:44:31;"- From your 50."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"- People do strong work in their 50s."
01:44:33;01:44:33;"- Yeah."
01:44:33;01:44:34;"- I have a feeling in some ways"
01:44:34;01:44:37;"the 50s are a clarifying moment."
01:44:37;01:44:41;"I'm kinda looking at it now and I picture like 35 to 40"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"I'm trying to make my five year plan,"
01:44:42;01:44:44;"my 10 year, my 15 year."
01:44:44;01:44:47;"Feel like in some ways, you just gotta survive."
01:44:47;01:44:49;"35 to 50 and then you hit 50 and you're like,"
01:44:49;01:44:52;"all right, makes sense or something."
01:44:52;01:44:54;"Jake, is being in your 40s random?"
01:44:54;01:44:55;"- Is it random?"
01:44:55;01:44:58;"- It strikes me as more random than being in your 50s."
01:44:58;01:44:59;"- What do you mean?"
01:44:59;01:45:01;"- You know, it's just like fricking random."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"(laughing)"
01:45:03;01:45:05;"- I feel like the 40s is sort of like"
01:45:05;01:45:07;"the peak of adulthood."
01:45:07;01:45:09;"'Cause you're not starting to fail physically yet,"
01:45:09;01:45:13;"but you're far enough along with what you're doing"
01:45:13;01:45:14;"that you sort of like know yourself"
01:45:14;01:45:17;"and you're comfortable with your place in the world"
01:45:17;01:45:20;"and hopefully you're doing something that you care about."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"And I feel like the 40s are like,"
01:45:22;01:45:24;"you know, the tide hasn't started going out yet."
01:45:24;01:45:25;"'Cause when you're in your 30s, you're like,"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"oh, people in their 40s are so old."
01:45:27;01:45:28;"- Right."
01:45:28;01:45:32;"- Like I'll be 52 in 10 years is like, damn."
01:45:32;01:45:35;"- I told you that I saw Red Hot Chili Peppers perform."
01:45:35;01:45:35;"- That's true."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"- At a benefit the other night,"
01:45:37;01:45:39;"the people at my table kept saying,"
01:45:39;01:45:41;"guess how old Ketus is?"
01:45:41;01:45:42;"- Right."
01:45:42;01:45:43;"- 57."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"- Amazing."
01:45:44;01:45:45;"- And Flea is 57 too."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"And they're in great shape."
01:45:46;01:45:47;"- They work out."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"- Yeah, they must work out."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"Do you ever see Ketus out in the lineup?"
01:45:51;01:45:52;"- I haven't yet, no."
01:45:52;01:45:53;"- Really?"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"- I have friends that have."
01:45:54;01:45:55;"- I'm surprised by that."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"- There's so many different places to go surfing though."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"- Yeah."
01:45:58;01:46:00;"- I happen to know, I won't say on air."
01:46:00;01:46:01;"- Right."
01:46:01;01:46:02;"- 'Cause these are, you know."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"- Don't blow up your spot."
01:46:03;01:46:04;"- I'm not gonna blow up his or my spot."
01:46:04;01:46:05;"- Right."

01:47:20;01:47:23;"Of all the quote unquote extreme sports."
01:47:23;01:47:25;"I mean maybe it's not really an extreme sport,"
01:47:25;01:47:27;"but it's like when you think about a lot of elements"
01:47:27;01:47:30;"of 20th century youth culture,"
01:47:30;01:47:33;"punk rock, skateboarding, I don't know."

01:47:35;01:47:37;"an air of few about them."
01:47:37;01:47:38;"Because you know, it's like youth culture."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"It's like this is our (beep)"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"we don't buy into your system, man."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"And there's always been something interesting to me"
01:47:43;01:47:46;"about surfing is that, I guess similar to the Grateful Dead"
01:47:46;01:47:48;"is that it's kind of a counterculture,"
01:47:48;01:47:51;"outside the box thing, but it also,"
01:47:51;01:47:53;"I'm sure there's elements of (beep) you in that,"
01:47:53;01:47:55;"you know, if somebody cuts you off or whatever."
01:47:55;01:47:57;"There's a peacefulness about it."
01:47:57;01:48:00;"And you know, the stereotype of a surfer"
01:48:00;01:48:02;"is kind of like a peaceful dude."
01:48:02;01:48:05;"So it's like kind of an interesting combination of things."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"- And you always struck me as a peaceful dude."
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Is that a fair assessment?"
01:48:09;01:48:09;"- I hope so."
01:48:09;01:48:11;"We're gonna play like music during this part, right?"

01:48:22;01:48:32;"So what's your relationship to surfing?"
01:48:32;01:48:33;"Does being out there on the water,"
01:48:33;01:48:35;"how does that affect like your day to day?"
01:48:35;01:48:38;"- Well, I feel like on like a scientific level,"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"they say the ocean has negative ions in it,"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"which affects you positively,"
01:48:43;01:48:47;"which I'm not that smart to know why that is."
01:48:47;01:48:48;"- But maybe there could be a little scientific--"
01:48:48;01:48:51;"- I think there's an actual thing that"
01:48:51;01:48:54;"getting into saltwater, what it does to me,"
01:48:54;01:48:56;"is like one of the hugest parts of surfing."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"- What does it feel like if you ever have to go like--"
01:48:58;01:48:59;"- Without it."
01:48:59;01:49:00;"- Yeah."
01:49:00;01:49:02;"- That's how I know that it affects me positively."
01:49:02;01:49:04;"- It's more than just missing it,"
01:49:04;01:49:05;"just like, oh man, I haven't played"
01:49:05;01:49:07;"any touch football in a while."
01:49:07;01:49:08;"Be fun to get the guys together."
01:49:08;01:49:09;"It feels deeper than that."
01:49:09;01:49:12;"- Yeah, I think the way it moves your blood around,"
01:49:12;01:49:14;"you're exercising, you're swimming,"
01:49:14;01:49:18;"you're moving on something that's also moving,"
01:49:18;01:49:22;"and trying to synchronize with a wave basically."
01:49:22;01:49:25;"You're just basically trying to go the same speed"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"as a wave while swimming in order to catch it."
01:49:28;01:49:31;"So you have to be moving at the same speed of a wave."
01:49:31;01:49:32;"You know what I mean?"
01:49:32;01:49:33;"- No slower, no faster."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"- That part seems so hard to me."
01:49:35;01:49:36;"- That's just the learning curve."
01:49:36;01:49:40;"That's the part that's hard, almost like a golf swing,"
01:49:40;01:49:42;"or like skiing, like learning how to use"
01:49:42;01:49:43;"the edge of a ski or something."
01:49:43;01:49:46;"I think it's just like a muscle group"
01:49:46;01:49:49;"that those specific activities only have,"
01:49:49;01:49:53;"or like shooting a three pointer or something."
01:49:53;01:49:55;"You wouldn't know how to do it unless you just"
01:49:55;01:49:55;"tried it and practiced it."
01:49:55;01:49:56;"- And you can only learn through practice."
01:49:56;01:49:58;"- And I learned it, yeah."
01:49:58;01:50:01;"So for me, it's just something that never gets old"
01:50:01;01:50:04;"because each wave is unique for one."
01:50:04;01:50:07;"- And even the waiting, as Tom Petty said,"
01:50:07;01:50:08;"the waiting is the hardest part,"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"and there's a lot of waiting in surfing"
01:50:10;01:50:11;"'cause you're waiting for the right wave,"
01:50:11;01:50:12;"and you're sitting on your board,"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"but you don't get bored."
01:50:13;01:50:16;"That's part of the joy, is also just"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"sitting on the board waiting."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"- Yeah, and while we're talking about"
01:50:19;01:50:21;"the Grickle Dead or Dead Shows or music,"
01:50:21;01:50:24;"the ocean is always changing."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"So it's not this static thing."
01:50:26;01:50:28;"So you could be sitting in this spot,"
01:50:28;01:50:31;"and some spots are almost like a pinball machine"
01:50:31;01:50:35;"that you start to realize it has a pattern."
01:50:35;01:50:40;"So the last set broke over here to the right side,"
01:50:40;01:50:42;"and everyone stays in the same place,"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"but you might go, oh, it hasn't broken"
01:50:44;01:50:46;"over there in 10 minutes."
01:50:46;01:50:50;"And so you're kind of like hunting when you're out there."
01:50:50;01:50:51;"- That doesn't stress you out."
01:50:51;01:50:52;"It's not like if you're at the airport"
01:50:52;01:50:54;"or the supermarket, and you're like,"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"I'm gonna get in that line because that one's"
01:50:56;01:50:57;"gonna go quicker, and then you look over and be like,"
01:50:57;01:50:59;"oh, (beep) I picked the wrong line."
01:50:59;01:51:03;"- What I'm saying is usually people"
01:51:03;01:51:04;"don't move around enough."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"So people will kind of tend to sit in groups"
01:51:07;01:51:09;"and talk sometimes or whatever."
01:51:09;01:51:11;"I don't sit with anyone else that much."
01:51:11;01:51:12;"I'm kind of like-- - Solitary experience."
01:51:12;01:51:15;"- Always on the move 'cause you're looking out."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"- But because you've been surfing for such a long time,"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"and people recognize you by your beard,"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"do people just say like, what's up?"
01:51:22;01:51:24;"- There's a lot of other beards out there nowadays."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"- Okay. - It's good camouflage."
01:51:26;01:51:26;"- Right."
01:51:26;01:51:29;"- I see people that I know not necessarily"
01:51:29;01:51:32;"every time I go, but weekly, and it's fine."
01:51:32;01:51:34;"- And is it more like a quiet head nod?"
01:51:34;01:51:36;"- No, it's like, hey, how's it going?"
01:51:36;01:51:37;"It's pretty normal."
01:51:37;01:51:38;"- You see Joker?"
01:51:38;01:51:40;"Yeah, right, okay."
01:51:40;01:51:42;"- No, we were doing the Joker laugh the other day"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"in the ocean, yeah. - Oh, really?"
01:51:44;01:51:45;"Oh, that's tight."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"Well, actually, one thing that I heard about you,"
01:51:47;01:51:51;"and we can cut this if this is too personal."
01:51:51;01:51:52;"Well, hold on, you know what I'm gonna say."
01:51:52;01:51:53;"- Well, wait a second."
01:51:53;01:51:56;"- I heard, and I don't have any context for this"
01:51:56;01:51:59;"as a very, only somebody who's surfed a handful of times."
01:51:59;01:52:02;"I heard that sometimes when you catch a wave,"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"you lie on your back on the surfboard"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"and you ride it coffin style."
01:52:05;01:52:07;"- I do that sometimes, yeah."
01:52:07;01:52:09;"- Is that what it's called, coffin style or something?"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"- Kinda, but from the way I understand it"
01:52:12;01:52:17;"is usually people on the longboard in the '60s,"
01:52:17;01:52:20;"or people still do it, but not that much anymore,"
01:52:20;01:52:22;"but lay all the way back."
01:52:22;01:52:25;"- Yeah, fully on your back facing the sky."
01:52:25;01:52:27;"- Yeah, so I don't really do that."
01:52:27;01:52:30;"- But to catch the wave, you have to jump up."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"- Head first, head first, yeah."
01:52:31;01:52:32;"- Head first, then you jump up on your feet"
01:52:32;01:52:34;"like a classic, right?"
01:52:34;01:52:34;"And then what happens?"
01:52:34;01:52:36;"- Sometimes you don't get all the way up."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"Sometimes you just kinda like are staying low."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"- Yeah."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"- Maybe Emmett told you that."
01:52:40;01:52:41;"- Yeah, that's who told me."
01:52:41;01:52:42;"- Yeah, so--"
01:52:42;01:52:43;"- He saw you in the lineup."
01:52:43;01:52:47;"- Yeah, he saw me at a place that's going right,"
01:52:47;01:52:49;"which is my back to the wave."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"- Yeah."
01:52:50;01:52:53;"- So if I were to stand up completely,"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"I would go slow with the kind of board that I ride."
01:52:55;01:52:56;"So I ride--"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"- So are you crouching?"
01:52:57;01:53:00;"- I'm kind of like, do you have a pen?"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"Can I draw a picture of it?"
01:53:01;01:53:02;"- Sure."
01:53:02;01:53:03;"- Great for radio."
01:53:03;01:53:06;"- Yeah, well, you can describe the picture."
01:53:06;01:53:06;"- So he's--"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"- Signpost, post the picture."
01:53:08;01:53:10;"- He's doing this."
01:53:10;01:53:11;"It's like, great for radio."
01:53:11;01:53:16;"- It's a new segment we do where surfers draw"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"pictures of how they surf."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"- Just have a bunch of surfers on just drawing about."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"- Nice horizon line."
01:53:22;01:53:23;"- That's the wave."
01:53:23;01:53:24;"- Oh."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"- So there's the horizon."
01:53:25;01:53:26;"- Oh yeah, there's the horizon line, my bad."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"- You're kind of like reclining like a Roman emperor"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"in this picture."
01:53:30;01:53:31;"- Exactly."
01:53:31;01:53:34;"And you see the right hand is kind of controlling my speed."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"So you're kind of petting the wave."
01:53:35;01:53:38;"- It's almost like somebody else could surf up next to you"
01:53:38;01:53:39;"and feed you grapes."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"- On a marble slate."
01:53:41;01:53:44;"- Are you in the pipeline when this is happening?"
01:53:44;01:53:47;"- Pipeline is the name of the spot on the west shore."
01:53:47;01:53:49;"Yeah, which has a great tube."
01:53:49;01:53:50;"- Are you in a tube?"
01:53:50;01:53:54;"- I would be more just in the curling part of the wave,"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"trying not to go faster than that spot."
01:53:56;01:53:57;"That's why I'm dragging my hand."
01:53:57;01:53:59;"'Cause I'm trying to stay in this spot of the wave."
01:53:59;01:54:01;"- So you're touching the water."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"- Yeah, like that."
01:54:02;01:54:02;"- That's cool."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"That must feel like very in touch with nature"
01:54:04;01:54:06;"to be like reclining like a Roman emperor on your board"
01:54:06;01:54:08;"and just like touching the wave."
01:54:08;01:54:09;"- It's pretty neat."
01:54:09;01:54:10;"- If I was just like sitting on the beach,"
01:54:10;01:54:14;"seeing people surf and I saw you doing that,"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"you would cut a quite unusual figure."
01:54:15;01:54:17;"I think I'd be like, what was that dude doing?"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- Right."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"I only have two fins on my board too."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- Versus what's typical?"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- The one that I have comes with three"
01:54:23;01:54:25;"and I take the middle one out."
01:54:25;01:54:26;"So it's faster."
01:54:26;01:54:29;"Like there's no drag in the middle of the board."
01:54:29;01:54:29;"- Yeah."
01:54:29;01:54:32;"- So there's like water running through the whole middle."
01:54:32;01:54:34;"If you think about a dolphin,"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"has two dorsals on top."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"These are called, I'm blanking."
01:54:39;01:54:41;"- Seinfeld nimber crunch."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"- Like posterior fins?"
01:54:43;01:54:44;"No."
01:54:44;01:54:45;"- We got a chart, Seinfeld?"
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- The pectoral fin."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"- Pectoral, I was gonna say pectoral."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"I didn't know."
01:54:49;01:54:51;"- So I feel like what my board is doing"
01:54:51;01:54:52;"is acting like a dolphin."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"And when you see a dolphin in a wave,"
01:54:54;01:54:56;"which they do,"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"they're just like, ooh."
01:54:57;01:54:58;"- Where you surf, you'll see dolphins here and there?"
01:54:58;01:54:59;"- Yeah, you'll see like--"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"- That's pretty wild."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"- They'll be inside the wave."
01:55:01;01:55:04;"They know how to use a wave."
01:55:04;01:55:06;"- So sometimes you're reclining like a Roman emperor,"
01:55:06;01:55:09;"touching the wave and you look and there's like a dolphin"
01:55:09;01:55:10;"and you just kind of--"
01:55:10;01:55:11;"- Not in the same wave usually."
01:55:11;01:55:11;"- Not in the same wave."
01:55:11;01:55:13;"- I mean, I've seen,"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"there's been a dolphin inside of a wave before."
01:55:16;01:55:19;"But usually you'll see them on their own waves."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- Yeah."
01:55:20;01:55:21;"- I saw sharks the other day."
01:55:21;01:55:23;"I saw like a five foot leopard shark."
01:55:23;01:55:24;"They're not--"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"- Leopard sharks aren't bad."
01:55:25;01:55:25;"- No."
01:55:25;01:55:26;"- Aren't scary."
01:55:26;01:55:27;"I know no sharks are bad."
01:55:27;01:55:29;"- But it was a little startling"
01:55:29;01:55:31;"'cause the water was super clear."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"And that's probably the biggest shark"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"I've ever seen around that spot."
01:55:34;01:55:35;"- Wait, are there any Little Wing songs"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"about straight up surfing?"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"- No."
01:55:38;01:55:39;"- 'Cause there's obviously skateboarding songs."
01:55:39;01:55:41;"- Do you know Jason Lytle from Granddaddy?"
01:55:41;01:55:44;"- Yeah, not personally, but I'm a wet, yeah."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"When I made the first Shredder song, he said,"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"""Do you know how hard it is"
01:55:48;01:55:50;"to write a song about skateboarding?"""
01:55:50;01:55:51;"And for me it wasn't"
01:55:51;01:55:54;"because I wasn't as close to skateboarding as he."
01:55:54;01:55:55;"- Yeah."
01:55:55;01:55:59;"- So I'm too close to surfing to write about surfing."
01:55:59;01:56:03;"I've written one, but it's like a weird B-side"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"and it's just kind of like--"
01:56:05;01:56:08;"- And also famously, the Beach Boys didn't really surf."
01:56:08;01:56:10;"Surfing USA."
01:56:10;01:56:13;"Well, anyway, thanks so much everybody."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"Hannah, Kyle. - Thank you."
01:56:14;01:56:15;"Thanks for having us."
01:56:15;01:56:17;"- For coming through for another Gratefulsgiving."
01:56:17;01:56:19;"I hope everybody had a good time,"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"whatever they did on Gratefulsgiving,"
01:56:20;01:56:23;"whether you spent it with your family"
01:56:23;01:56:26;"or by yourself, solo,"
01:56:26;01:56:29;"turkey sub at Subway, whatever floats your boat."
01:56:29;01:56:32;"All that matters is that you show some gratitude"
01:56:32;01:56:34;"to the universe, maybe throw on some Grateful Dead."
01:56:34;01:56:36;"And by the way, I consider Gratefulgiving"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"is the whole four-day experience."
01:56:38;01:56:40;"If you had a bad Thursday,"
01:56:40;01:56:43;"you went to some weird (beep) bad vibe Thanksgiving dinner,"
01:56:43;01:56:47;"you still got the whole rest of Sunday today to be grateful."
01:56:47;01:56:50;"What was your uncle's euphemism for getting high?"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"- Talk to Ted."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"- Grab your favorite cousin, go talk to Ted."
01:56:53;01:56:57;"Maybe you read aloud some Robert Hunter lyrics."
01:56:57;01:57:00;"Well, so this is the first time you've been on the show, Kyle?"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"- It is. - That's unbelievable."
01:57:01;01:57:03;"You're automatic friend of the show."
01:57:03;01:57:04;"We gotta have you back soon."
01:57:04;01:57:05;"- Amen, amen."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"- All right, great."
01:57:06;01:57:08;"Another holiday weekend."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"See you next time."
