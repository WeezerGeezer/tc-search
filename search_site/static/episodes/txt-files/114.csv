00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis in a Time of Crisis."
00:04;00:08;"In a FaceTime of Crisis."
00:08;00:14;"We reunite with the crew and some very special guests to talk about everything from Starbucking"
00:14;00:17;"to COVID-19."
00:17;00:22;"But of course, even in these troubled times, we take a moment to dive into the tasteful"
00:22;00:26;"palette of the 1970s and some of that old wisdom."
00:26;00:32;"This is a Weekly Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:32;00:34;"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep."
00:34;00:35;"Spawn."
00:35;00:36;"One."
00:36;00:37;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:37;00:38;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances."
00:38;00:57;"But picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:57;01:21;"And so I dealt to the blow, one of us had to go."
01:21;01:22;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:22;01:23;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:23;01:24;"Leave alone me there."
01:24;01:25;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:25;01:33;"This is now our third Time of Crisis, Time Crisis, meaning three weeks of lockdown."
01:33;01:36;"Can you believe that the first time we did it, we were actually thinking about getting"
01:36;01:37;"in the studio."
01:37;01:38;"Right."
01:38;01:39;"You had a slight fever."
01:39;01:40;"Yeah, I had a slight fever."
01:40;01:44;"I'd had a fever for a few days and just wasn't feeling so hot."
01:44;01:45;"What came of that?"
01:45;01:47;"It passed, it subsided."
01:47;01:48;"It has subsided."
01:48;01:55;"It felt a little bit crazy at the time to make that call two weeks ago to say, ""Hey,"
01:55;01:57;"I think we should FaceTime."""
01:57;02:01;"But that was like right, I think that was like a Wednesday or a Thursday that we were"
02:01;02:02;"taping that week."
02:02;02:06;"And it was like right on the day when things really started to change."
02:06;02:12;"Yeah, I remember it might have been earlier in the week, but I remember the last time"
02:12;02:15;"I even considered like doing something."
02:15;02:17;"She's come up a lot on this show."
02:17;02:21;"Kelly Reichardt, my friend, asked me if I want to go see her new movie, First Cow."
02:21;02:25;"And whatever it was, it was like early in that week."
02:25;02:29;"It must have been before I went to Florida for that festival, but or maybe I just gotten"
02:29;02:30;"back actually."
02:30;02:34;"Either way, it was right on the cusp of being like, well, a movie theater."
02:34;02:39;"It's not a very crowded place for like a daytime showing of something."
02:39;02:41;"Although for all I know, you know, LA is an industry town."
02:41;02:44;"Maybe the 1pm show is the first cow jammed."
02:44;02:45;"But I was like, yeah, maybe."
02:45;02:49;"And it's also that funny feeling when someone suggests something to you."
02:49;02:53;"I often assume that people are like more rational than me."
02:53;02:55;"So you know, somebody else is like, oh, yeah, let's go see a movie."
02:55;02:57;"Like, oh, OK, people still see it movies."
02:57;02:58;"Cool."
02:58;03:00;"But then at some point I was like, yeah, I think I planted the seed of doubt."
03:00;03:01;"I was like, yeah, you're right."
03:01;03:02;"It won't be crowded."
03:02;03:03;"And if it's really crowded, we could dip."
03:03;03:04;"And they're like, oh, really?"
03:04;03:06;"You think it's things are going to get that weird?"
03:06;03:08;"I was like, I don't know."
03:08;03:09;"And then I was like, we could just take a hike."
03:09;03:11;"And then we took a hike instead."
03:11;03:15;"And that was the last time I like did something that must have been like two and a half weeks"
03:15;03:16;"ago now."
03:16;03:17;"Yeah."
03:17;03:24;"I bailed on my sister-in-law's birthday the night before we did the first FaceTime crisis."
03:24;03:26;"And I felt bad about that at the time."
03:26;03:27;"It seemed extreme."
03:27;03:31;"But looking back, it was like, OK, that was the right thing to do."
03:31;03:36;"That brings us up to now, the third time of crisis, time crisis."
03:36;03:37;"Things have been locked down."
03:37;03:39;"Jake, have you been back to Home Depot lately?"
03:39;03:40;"Haven't been by."
03:40;03:42;"I should do another drive by tomorrow."
03:42;03:43;"Check it out."
03:43;03:49;"I was talking to a friend today who went to Home Depot this morning."
03:49;03:50;"Yeah."
03:50;03:53;"And they've basically taped off the area."
03:53;03:58;"So when you're in line, you're basically in your quarantine zone."
03:58;04:02;"So you can't step over the tape to keep people six feet apart."
04:02;04:03;"All right, good."
04:03;04:07;"Is that in line to get into the building or is that check cashing out?"
04:07;04:08;"Cashing out."
04:08;04:12;"I can't imagine they got a line out the building yet, but maybe they do."
04:12;04:17;"But it's certainly cashing out that, you know, you have your quarantine zone."
04:17;04:19;"We've seen these images from around the country."
04:19;04:22;"I'm sure you guys have seen some of them."
04:22;04:28;"There's one I saw on Twitter of delivery people all jammed outside of this restaurant, Carbone"
04:28;04:31;"in New York, which is a great restaurant."
04:31;04:32;"It's expensive."
04:32;04:34;"It's a bougie restaurant."
04:34;04:37;"They famously have a $70 veal parm."
04:37;04:42;"Have we ever talked about the $70 veal parm on the show?"
04:42;04:44;"Is that a favorite of Ariana Grande's?"
04:44;04:45;"Well, we've done."
04:45;04:47;"Yeah, I know we've talked about veal parm."
04:47;04:48;"Oh, yeah."
04:48;04:53;"It's the type of place that you're often taken out to eat at in like the showbiz people."
04:53;04:58;"It's like a fun Italian restaurant."
04:58;05:00;"But it's like, you know, the veal parm, I've seen it."
05:00;05:02;"It's this giant piece of veal."
05:02;05:03;"It's very large and whatever."
05:03;05:07;"And I think there's something about, you know, veal already rubs people the wrong way."
05:07;05:12;"I know I'm surprised it's served in like a fancy bougie restaurant where people have"
05:12;05:14;"a pretty liberal sensibility."
05:14;05:18;"I don't think the anti-veal lobby really made all that much of a dent."
05:18;05:22;"I mean, like definitely a lot of places have banned foie gras."
05:22;05:27;"I think because there was like a lot of emphasis put on the fact like to get this pate thing,"
05:27;05:31;"they have to really force feed a goose."
05:31;05:34;"And you know, so then you're picturing something being tortured."
05:34;05:39;"And I imagine for the average meat eater, when they think about veal, somebody saying"
05:39;05:41;"like they're killing like a baby cow."
05:41;05:45;"And then I bet maybe the average person is like, yeah, all right."
05:45;05:48;"Maybe that's better than like raising a cow to die later."
05:48;05:49;"Who knows?"
05:49;05:50;"I'm not condoning it."
05:50;05:55;"You know that I have strong sympathies with the vegans and the animal rights activists."
05:55;05:59;"It's also that the baby cow is kept in a confined space."
05:59;06:02;"Is that part of veal that the cow can't have a good life?"
06:02;06:03;"Something to do with the muscles."
06:03;06:04;"You want to keep the muscles tender."
06:04;06:08;"This is a gross conversation, but we're giving that baby a great life."
06:08;06:15;"We made sure that the baby cow had an extra bad life to make sure that your $70 veal parm"
06:15;06:16;"is extra tender."
06:16;06:35;"I've taken a walk to an African park one day."
06:35;06:58;"I'm walking with wildlife."
06:58;07:06;"So clearly this is a, this image of a bunch of underpaid, although hopefully not underpaid,"
07:06;07:07;"anybody who can afford it."
07:07;07:12;"If you're ordering anything from the outside world these days, you got to be cranking that"
07:12;07:15;"tip up to minimum 25%."
07:15;07:19;"I think 20% a lot of people say, well, that's what you do at a restaurant."
07:19;07:23;"But I feel like with delivery stuff, because they, what's the lowest option they give you"
07:23;07:24;"on those apps?"
07:24;07:25;"Usually like 10%."
07:25;07:26;"Which is kind of insulting."
07:26;07:28;"It's like, why, you know, come on."
07:28;07:32;"That'd be like maybe a cool move on the part of what are these places called?"
07:32;07:38;"Uber Eats, Postmates, Grubhub, Caviar, Ciao Now, DoorDash."
07:38;07:42;"If you can afford to order in, you can afford to give a big fat tip."
07:42;07:47;"So anyway, picture this, this image that people are seeing a fancy restaurant in New York"
07:47;07:50;"City, already known as the city of the house and the have-nots."
07:50;07:55;"A bunch of people jammed together, no rhyme or reason, no six foot organizational thing"
07:55;07:57;"happening."
07:57;08:06;"Just a bunch of delivery people jammed outside waiting to pick up piping hot $70 veal parms."
08:06;08:08;"So gnarly."
08:08;08:15;"Which now I'm learning they specifically gave the baby cow a bad life to make it taste good."
08:15;08:18;"So anyway, so people are looking at this image like, good Lord."
08:18;08:23;"And the first thing in my head, I was just thinking, God, can't somebody, I know it's"
08:23;08:24;"tough for restaurants."
08:24;08:28;"Can't they hire somebody who, one of their employees that they probably are about to"
08:28;08:33;"lay off and just be like, we'll give you like a serious mask and a hazmat suit and you can"
08:33;08:38;"just be in charge of a crowd control outside for everybody's safety."
08:38;08:39;"Everybody six feet apart."
08:39;08:43;"I got four veal parms going out to Jake Longstreth."
08:43;08:44;"If that's you, come get it."
08:44;08:45;"Everybody else keep your distance."
08:45;08:50;"Yeah, I'm just scanning the veal Wikipedia page, which is a kind of a bleak document"
08:50;08:51;"as you might imagine."
08:51;08:54;"But yeah, they're housed in pens."
08:54;08:57;"Because the better the life, the worse the veal."
08:57;09:01;"This is something that a lot of people believe this."
09:01;09:04;"A lot of people believe this about art as well."
09:04;09:08;"The artist needs a very shitty life to produce the truly delicious, tender art."
09:08;09:11;"You have to suffer."
09:11;09:16;"You know, I saw on the New York Times today that Guitar Center is keeping some of their"
09:16;09:20;"stores open, which is an essential service."
09:20;09:21;"Interesting."
09:21;09:26;"People were going in and trying out guitars and then hanging them back up on the wall."
09:26;09:29;"And it just seemed like a recipe for disaster."
09:29;09:35;"I mean, I can see why they still, maybe people are still ordering music equipment."
09:35;09:38;"I could imagine that for some people who aren't living too close to the bone and just worrying"
09:38;09:44;"about their next meal, maybe there's a few weekend warrior, kind of like lawyer type"
09:44;09:50;"dads, accountants, kind of white collar people who are just like, you know what?"
09:50;09:52;"Living at home isn't half bad."
09:52;09:57;"Just like going through documents and being like, you know, now that I'm not commuting,"
09:57;10:00;"I wouldn't mind maybe getting back into some guitar."
10:00;10:03;"I've been meaning to, I mean, it's crossed my mind."
10:03;10:08;"I kind of want to get some more equipment at the crib while I'm here all the time."
10:08;10:10;"Is your stuff in storage somewhere?"
10:10;10:13;"You know, I got a little setup at home."
10:13;10:17;"You know, all of our touring gear is, I don't even know."
10:17;10:20;"Actually, all our touring gear for all I know might be in Argentina right now because that's"
10:20;10:22;"where we were about to be."
10:22;10:23;"Whoa."
10:23;10:28;"I actually got an alert on my phone today that said, get ready for your flight to Buenos"
10:28;10:29;"Aires."
10:29;10:30;"I was like, that's not happening."
10:30;10:35;"Yeah, because they moved Lollapalooza to South America to later in the year."
10:35;10:39;"I can imagine why people want to still order musical equipment for sure, but yet to have"
10:39;10:42;"the actual store open, that's kind of strange."
10:42;10:43;"Yeah."
10:43;10:46;"Well, Jake, how's your mental state?"
10:46;10:47;"It's pretty good."
10:47;10:50;"We have a nice rhythm going at the house now."
10:50;10:53;"Can't really complain in terms of how things are going."
10:53;10:59;"I got to say for me, I'm not stir crazy, which I guess I wouldn't have guessed I would be."
10:59;11:01;"I don't usually go stir crazy."
11:01;11:06;"I've lived in some like real small rooms in my life from college and after college."
11:06;11:09;"I've always been like, I'm happy to chill for a while."
11:09;11:10;"Yeah."
11:10;11:14;"So I don't find the stress of like being in one place to be like unbearable."
11:14;11:20;"Although I also I got to extend sympathy to anybody who's just riding this one out solo."
11:20;11:24;"That's I'm sure is a different feeling if you're not with friends or family or loved"
11:24;11:25;"ones."
11:25;11:26;"That's going to be a different feeling."
11:26;11:28;"But yeah, the idea of just like not leaving the house."
11:28;11:32;"I feel like if you told me I couldn't like leave the house for like a year, I'd be like,"
11:32;11:34;"all right, I'm down with that."
11:34;11:35;"What about you, Jake?"
11:35;11:37;"If you're under house arrest?"
11:37;11:39;"True house arrest, like you can't leave the house."
11:39;11:43;"Yeah, like I can't go for a run, for instance, because I usually go for a run almost every"
11:43;11:48;"day, which is nice because I get out, get some air."
11:48;11:49;"Look at some trees, look at the light."
11:49;11:52;"Okay, you can go in the backyard, you can be out in the air."
11:52;11:54;"You just can't leave the premises."
11:54;11:59;"I mean, I think I could do a year if I had to, if I was literally under house arrest"
11:59;12:01;"and it was like, you have no choice in the matter."
12:01;12:06;"I think I could like find my inner strength and like composure to like keep it together."
12:06;12:09;"Even if somebody said I couldn't leave the house for like three years, especially with"
12:09;12:12;"the internet and stuff, I'd really be, I think I could hold it down."
12:12;12:16;"I don't know about like the economics of it, but just like mentally, that would take some"
12:16;12:19;"fortitude three years."
12:19;12:24;"In this current quarantine situation, and certainly in a three year situation, what"
12:24;12:27;"are you guys going to do about haircuts?"
12:27;12:33;"You see, when I brought it off air, you seemed not as concerned as I thought you'd be."
12:33;12:34;"What is going to happen?"
12:34;12:36;"Oh, I'm not concerned about it at all."
12:36;12:41;"I mean, I always get the most concerned about haircuts when I like, going to go on tour,"
12:41;12:45;"like doing something on TV, because I'm like, I don't want to look like a bum."
12:45;12:47;"I care way less at home."
12:47;12:52;"And then the small aspects of a haircut that really make me feel like clean, that's just"
12:52;12:56;"like a little bit of a buzz, you know, buzz on the back of the neck, a little clean up"
12:56;12:58;"over the ears."
12:58;13:03;"And I was talking to Rashida just today, she gave herself a little trim, I don't know if"
13:03;13:05;"she might have been doing her bangs or something."
13:05;13:06;"She was like, what are you going to do?"
13:06;13:07;"You need help?"
13:07;13:09;"And I was like, yeah, maybe, maybe just a little bit here and there."
13:09;13:11;"So I think that'll be sufficient."
13:11;13:12;"What are you guys thinking?"
13:12;13:14;"I think I'm gonna let it grow to quote Mountain Bruce."
13:14;13:15;"I am a country boy."
13:15;13:16;"I am Mother Nature's son."
13:16;13:17;"I am a rambling man."
13:17;13:18;"Me and the boys are a band on the run."
13:18;13:19;"When I am home with you, we sit in the shade of the tree."
13:19;13:20;"Lie back on the shady lawn."
13:20;13:21;"I'm a country boy."
13:21;13:22;"I am Mother Nature's son."
13:22;13:23;"I am a rambling man."
13:23;13:24;"Me and the boys are a band on the run."
13:24;13:25;"When I am home with you, we sit in the shade of the tree."
13:25;13:26;"Lie back on the shady lawn."
13:26;13:27;"I'm a rambling man."
13:27;13:28;"Me and the boys are a band on the run."
13:28;13:29;"I am a country boy."
13:29;13:30;"I am Mother Nature's son."
13:30;13:31;"I am a rambling man."
13:31;13:52;"When I am home with you, we sit in the shade of the tree."
13:52;14:14;"Lie back on the shady lawn."
14:14;14:17;", what's the longest you're like shoulder length?"
14:17;14:20;"Oh yeah, I can kind of picture you with that long hair."
14:20;14:24;"Yeah, I think that last time I had long hair was like 14 or 15."
14:24;14:25;"Like not that long ago."
14:25;14:27;"Have you ever had dreadlocks?"
14:27;14:29;"Uh, hell yeah, man."
14:29;14:30;"Senior year of high school."
14:30;14:31;"Nice."
14:31;14:32;"It was such a sick look."
14:32;14:33;"No, I'm kidding."
14:33;14:41;"I did have long hair my senior year of high school."
14:41;14:44;"When I see photos of it, it looks so bad."
14:44;14:46;"I had very long hair towards the end of high school too."
14:46;14:47;"Really?"
14:47;14:48;"Is that some kind of like rite of passage?"
14:48;14:52;"Yeah, you're just like senior year letting it grow, man."
14:52;14:58;"It was very long, but my hair used to get, maybe it still would if it was long, but the"
14:58;15:01;"longer it got, the more curly it would get."
15:01;15:02;"Like fro?"
15:02;15:06;"Not really a fro, but like some pretty like big curls."
15:06;15:11;"As it would grow, like occasionally, just depending on how it dried or the weather,"
15:11;15:16;"I might get like in the front, like a big fat, like sausage curl, almost like a little"
15:16;15:19;"girl from like the Victorian era or something."
15:19;15:20;"Oh, okay."
15:20;15:22;"It would just turn out and grow this like, I don't know."
15:22;15:24;"I think that is something, a sausage curl."
15:24;15:30;"It didn't have that like long and straight look, like kind of like metal dude, but yeah,"
15:30;15:31;"that's what I was working with."
15:31;15:34;"And then when I went to college, I still had long hair."
15:34;15:35;"And then at some point I just buzzed it."
15:35;15:40;"That'd be a tight look for her vampire going forward."
15:40;15:41;"Long hair again."
15:41;15:47;"As the band kind of, you know, continues to develop its jam chops, just get a little crunchier."
15:47;15:50;"You grow the hair out, stocks and socks."
15:50;15:55;"I mean, I've thought about that is that I don't think as the front man of this band,"
15:55;15:58;"I'm really on brand with my current haircut."
15:58;16:03;"I was thinking that when we saw pigeons playing ping pong after goose, although goose is like"
16:03;16:07;"pretty clean cut, but pigeons playing ping pong, there's multiple people in that band"
16:07;16:12;"with just like serious hair, real curly, real long."
16:12;16:14;"And honestly, it's a joy to watch on stage."
16:14;16:15;"Yeah."
16:15;16:19;"I don't think that's as much a thing anymore with rock bands having the serious hair."
16:19;16:24;"No, I remember what a big deal it was in the nineties for Metallica to cut their hair."
16:24;16:26;"I think it just doesn't mean anything now."
16:26;16:29;"It used to be like this line in the sand, right?"
16:29;16:31;"You're a long hair or you're not."
16:31;16:33;"And I just don't think it means anything."
16:33;16:37;"So if there's a band like a couple of dudes had long hair, it just doesn't like read any"
16:37;16:38;"kind of way."
16:38;16:42;"No, I remember like in the nineties, it'd be like, oh, that band has short hair."
16:42;16:48;"Crazy bunch of short hairs like, oh, pavement, like guys in pavement have like short hair"
16:48;16:49;"in like ninety two."
16:49;16:52;"I was like, whoa, that's cool."
16:52;16:53;"Like that's like an interesting vibe."
16:53;16:56;"Are you familiar with the Rasta phrase bald head?"
16:56;16:57;"No."
16:57;17:01;"There's a lot of like reggae songs, including some Bob Marley that they use the phrase bald"
17:01;17:07;"head to describe like a non Rasta often referred to in a derogatory way, like a crazy bald"
17:07;17:08;"head."
17:08;17:13;"But I was funny, too, because it's like it's not literally talking about like a bald man."
17:13;17:19;"It's kind of like any dude without locks is just a bald head, which is a little bit."
17:19;17:23;"There's something similar in like rock music, too, or like old school rock metal."
17:23;17:25;"It's like you don't have long hair, man."
17:25;17:28;"You might as well have a crew cut because you're."
17:28;17:34;"I mean, you might play guitar like Steve Vai, but if you have short hair, not interested."
17:34;17:35;"I'm crazy."
17:36;17:37;"We're going to chase those crazy ballads out of town."
17:37;17:38;"Chase those crazy ballads out of town."
17:38;17:39;"A higher night bill."
17:39;17:40;"I'm going to chase those crazy ballads out of town."
17:49;18:12;"I'm going to chase those crazy ballads out of town."
18:12;18:34;"I'm going to chase those crazy ballads out of town."
18:34;18:35;"I'm going to chase those crazy ballads out of town."
18:42;18:48;"the mantha my wife and she's going to try to sort of coach her through cutting my hair."
18:48;18:52;"I don't think it's going to go very well so I just have to be prepared like I've tried"
18:52;18:56;"to have a mantha cut my hair forever like I grew up my mom cut my hair a mantha just"
18:56;19:01;"wants nothing to do with it and thinks she's really gonna fuck it up so I have to be prepared"
19:01;19:07;"if I do that that it may just end with me shaving my head. Would it be like full Rogan"
19:07;19:14;"style? Yeah I think it would be I'd go full rogue. I want to see this. I got a question"
19:14;19:17;"so Nick you're talking about your wife and then your mother used to cut your hair my"
19:17;19:24;"mom used to cut my hair too how come hair cutting in the home it's kind of I guess traditionally"
19:24;19:29;"old school gender roles it's always like mom cuts your hair but then barbershop culture"
19:29;19:34;"is like always the fellas. I have a story about that yeah so yeah in my house it was"
19:34;19:41;"always my mom cut my hair interesting gender role side thing is that my mom exclusively"
19:41;19:47;"drives and my dad doesn't and really never drove us which is again sort of opposite gender"
19:47;19:51;"roles like it's always the dad drives the car and in my house it was the opposite. I"
19:51;19:56;"think that's like the old school kind of like sexist roll call is just like if the father"
19:56;20:02;"is present he will drive if the father is not present and no boys in the family have"
20:02;20:10;"a license then the mother will drive but only when the father is not present. Yeah but see"
20:10;20:15;"your dad never drove. Wait why is that? I don't know it's just sort of how it played"
20:15;20:21;"out I don't think he's a particularly good driver I think it's some maybe weird other"
20:21;20:27;"sort of patriarchal gendered thing my dad liked the idea of being driven around even"
20:27;20:32;"though it's sort of sort of the merit like culturally would be the man to drive I think"
20:32;20:37;"he just sort of found his own comfort zone and being driven around which probably played"
20:37;20:43;"out in a chauvinistic way. Would he always go in the passenger seat? Yeah he'd always"
20:43;20:49;"just go in the passenger seat. But would he drive himself around? No. Solo? No not really."
20:49;20:55;"He just he would take the bus. Whoa. But then I do I will say to the going back to the haircut"
20:55;21:03;"situation I remember being around 13 12 13 years old and seeing Boys in the Hood you"
21:03;21:08;"know there's sort of a famous scene where you do you remember this scene they're in"
21:08;21:14;"the kitchen and Lawrence Fishburne's cutting Cuba Gooding Jr.'s hair his son's hair and"
21:14;21:18;"it's like he's giving him a fade and he's like yeah he gives the best fade and they"
21:18;21:23;"have this really like great father-son bonding moment and I remember going to my dad and"
21:23;21:29;"saying dad I want to have a similar father-son bonding moment with you that Cuba Gooding"
21:29;21:36;"Jr. had in the movie with Lawrence Fishburne and asking my dad to give me a fade. And not"
21:36;21:42;"only is my dad has no idea how to cut hair I can't also get a fade I just don't really"
21:42;21:48;"have that hair like it's we're very different hair so we went to CVS and my dad bought a"
21:48;21:53;"razor and he tried to give me a fade he basically just gave me sort of a mohawk he just sort"
21:53;21:57;"of just sort of accidentally just sort of shaved all the way in the back of my head"
21:57;22:02;"to the front and then on the other side and I had this really crooked mohawk that was"
22:02;22:09;"just from zero to a hundred on the sides like no fade yeah and it was right before class"
22:09;22:15;"pictures and my mom was mortified yeah but we also didn't have the bonding experience"
22:15;22:20;"either there was no there it was it was it was really tense and my dad didn't know what"
22:20;22:25;"he was doing and he just mom is like this is why I cut there because why I got there"
22:25;22:28;"I'm very impressed by anybody who can cut hair and I'm very curious about what's gonna"
22:28;22:35;"go down when you do this kind of FaceTime remote haircut training the first thing it"
22:35;22:41;"makes me think of is like in a movie when there's like a layperson ends up near a bomb"
22:41;22:46;"and then the bomb squad cop has to call them on the phone and they're just like freaking"
22:46;22:52;"out they're just like listen to me do you see two wires I think so okay is one of them"
22:52;22:59;"blue oh yeah one's blue okay next to that is a yellow one okay now up top you like this"
22:59;23:05;"is like a classic movie this is like because with hair I've always been mystified that"
23:05;23:10;"hair is on the one hand it's like it's kind of like simple right like you would think"
23:10;23:17;"it's not that hard to be good at cutting hair and yet as anybody knows the difference between"
23:17;23:23;"a good skilled person and other person I mean you're talking about your self-esteem for"
23:23;23:28;"a month you're talking about your whole well-being your mental health it's a very serious job"
23:28;23:33;"and I've always kind of wondered like actually the the woman who cuts my hair she's great"
23:33;23:40;"shout out to Candice and she tells me about how sometimes she she'll like give classes"
23:40;23:44;"or that you know there's a whole system for training people and stuff I wonder even like"
23:44;23:49;"what the language is yeah specialized hair cutting terms that we don't know but when"
23:49;23:54;"they're talking to each other they're just like now grab the bridle now hold the bridle"
23:54;23:59;"straight like when you look at a hair from like the top and you see these weird things"
23:59;24:04;"is it like you know when you see one of those like posters for all the different pieces"
24:04;24:09;"of meat and a cow and you got like your hanger steak and your rump roast is there like that"
24:09;24:14;"for hair you have your world is that how you say it quarrel you guys know the word I'm"
24:14;24:20;"talking about yeah yeah yeah it's a pattern of spirals or concentric circles so everybody"
24:20;24:26;"most people have some type of quarrel in the back of their head you know like where your"
24:26;24:31;"hair kind of spirals out so I wonder are there all sorts of like weird sacred geometries"
24:31;24:36;"and people say because I've had people cut my hair will often say like the back of my"
24:36;24:41;"neck it's like the the hair goes in different directions so it's very complex to like make"
24:41;24:46;"it straight and obviously people have cow licks yeah we know some of these words like"
24:46;24:52;"cow lick and whirl but then I yeah I wonder if there's like a true map of it it almost"
24:52;24:57;"reminds me of like you know like in the medieval times where there would be like these guilds"
24:57;25:03;"that had their very specialized knowledge about how to make like blue glass and like"
25:03;25:08;"metal stuff I wonder if like you hair yeah yeah there's like a whole other language and"
25:08;25:12;"way of looking at hair that you know like we just see a haircut we're like hey it looks"
25:12;25:17;"good on you they look at it and they must be seeing you know like beautiful mind type"
25:17;25:21;"by the way guys I gotta go now to go have dinner with Amantha for her birthday say what's"
25:21;25:29;"up I will I also do think maybe because I've never sort of live streamed or IG that was"
25:29;25:36;"like maybe that would just be a funny thing to have to basically do through my Instagram"
25:36;25:40;"because everyone's doing it now to have the woman do that through Amantha and then we"
25:40;25:45;"can film it but I do think I mean I'll let you guys know because I think there's a fairly"
25:45;25:50;"I don't know it's more than 50/50 60/40 that it's gonna really go sideways and I'm gonna"
25:50;25:56;"have to shave my head that's what I want to have or just just wear a hat I want to see"
25:56;26:01;"that a couple guys well you might see it next week all right I don't think I don't think"
26:01;26:05;"I'm ready for a haircut next week I think we're talking in a week but we're in a weekly"
26:05;26:11;"TC mode so you're gonna see it all right guys I love you I love you stay safe talk to you"
26:11;26:13;"in a bit all right all right peace peace"
26:13;26:20;"darling don't you go and cut your hair do you think it's gonna make him"
26:20;26:49;"you're listening to time crisis on beats one and two and three and four and five and"
26:49;26:55;"six so Jake we've been going to the supermarket yeah we went we did like a big stock up like"
26:55;27:02;"two weeks ago mm-hmm and then I've I've gone there's a little grocery store like a block"
27:02;27:07;"from my house called uno market mm-hmm and I've gone there like three or four times to"
27:07;27:15;"buy like avocados and like beer and chips and stuff so what's the vibe you feel comfortable"
27:15;27:18;"are you like suiting up you throwing a mask on gloves are you staying six feet away from"
27:18;27:25;"people I'm keeping my distance no gloves no mask people there who work there are wearing"
27:25;27:32;"gloves and masks mm-hmm the last time I went it seemed to be a higher level of anxiety"
27:32;27:38;"there than the other times oh you feel like it's been ratcheting up yeah I feel like it"
27:38;27:42;"we've had a few grocery deliveries mm-hmm which you know I have to order out like three"
27:42;27:48;"or four days in advance I'm just been making a lot of food are you drinking a lot of coffee"
27:48;27:53;"yeah big time yeah it's an interesting one because I find the relationship to coffee"
27:53;27:58;"I've been thinking about it because when you're quarantined you've still got stuff to do but"
27:58;28:04;"you you can make the case you know it's not like you're commuting into town and running"
28:04;28:08;"to meetings and stuff you know like maybe you need less coffee but also the temptation"
28:08;28:14;"just to drink coffee all day is very strong when you're just posted up in the house what"
28:14;28:20;"time are you drinking coffee until I rarely go past 4 p.m. 4 is late yeah maybe it's a"
28:20;28:24;"little too late I've been falling asleep as early as I'd like to I'm usually cut that"
28:24;28:28;"off around 1 yeah man I really wonder what it's like out there because you see these"
28:28;28:35;"images you know I think for people who are working as delivery people working at supermarkets"
28:35;28:42;"these are really hardcore jobs right now yeah and you really got a hope that all these places"
28:42;28:48;"well you know whether it's these apps or the actual supermarkets are treating people correctly"
28:48;28:53;"because it's funny like obviously this is a huge moment in terms of like a lot of businesses"
28:53;28:57;"simply can't afford to keep their staff on and that's why you know hopefully the government"
28:57;29:02;"will be helping people out who lose their jobs but these businesses that actually are"
29:02;29:09;"booming like supermarkets and you know food delivery and stuff you really got a hope that"
29:09;29:15;"they're like going the extra mile to take care of people they're probably not yeah odds"
29:15;29:21;"are they aren't major corporations aren't known for that what about you man pretty stocked"
29:21;29:26;"up so I haven't been to a supermarket in a while you guys doing some post yeah I've ordered"
29:26;29:31;"in here and there yeah but even then it's like yeah I'm like mixed feelings about it"
29:31;29:36;"like I guess on the one hand it's like you're supporting yeah local restaurants and you"
29:36;29:41;"know trying to support the delivery people but yeah it's just like a strange feeling"
29:41;29:46;"to a little bit of stress every time you bring something new into the house and you really"
29:46;29:51;"got a kind of wipe it down and stuff but yeah I'm very curious about well I think maybe"
29:51;29:55;"a lot of people feel this way but it's hard when you're quarantined you're taking a bunch"
29:55;30:00;"of information you talk to your friends but most people I know are taking it very seriously"
30:00;30:05;"but I'm just kind of curious what like what it's like out there because you know when"
30:05;30:09;"you're taking it seriously you only get images and anecdotes so I'm kind of curious like"
30:09;30:14;"are there still parts of the country that are like fully business as usual I think I"
30:14;30:19;"mean he's all his images on like Florida beaches and down south right just jam-packed guitar"
30:19;30:27;"centers and then I'm also just kind of curious what it's like for people who are still going"
30:27;30:34;"to work and just kind of what that looks like and anyway I was interesting for me following"
30:34;30:40;"friend of the show winter on Twitter because he was kind of like out there I think he's"
30:40;30:46;"home now and we're gonna get him on the phone shortly but following winter on Twitter you"
30:46;30:51;"know most people I follow on Twitter like you know journalists and people who are probably"
30:51;30:56;"locked down in their apartments fairly early on and then winter was the one person who"
30:56;31:03;"I felt was like giving me a small window through the lens of starbucking into just like the"
31:03;31:09;"country slowly closing down so winter was like out there on some kind of journey and"
31:09;31:14;"yeah he was kind of reporting like well you know the Starbucks is like totally open then"
31:14;31:19;"he's like gets to one where like the managers like new policy you know things are changing"
31:19;31:23;"and then suddenly some of them are closed and so kind of almost felt like winter was"
31:23;31:28;"out there on the road starbucking just as this started to happen so I feel like in real"
31:28;31:36;"time his starbucking journey he was kind of just pinballing through this maze of Kovat"
31:36;31:43;"America this would probably be a good movie one day or doc series the last days of starbucking"
31:43;31:49;"Corona winter he has the dominoes are falling yeah as the dominoes fall like yeah it's kind"
31:49;31:54;"of just like somebody's on vacation just as like you know there's a revolution in the"
31:54;32:01;"country yeah we were down in Cuba down in 59 is a beautiful resort there I mean that"
32:01;32:05;"literally happened because wasn't it New Year's Eve yes I think you're right so there were"
32:05;32:10;"all sorts of Americans just like partying it up at like a Cuban casino in 1959 just"
32:10;32:14;"like whoa what's going on I bet it's probably really similar actually to some of the stories"
32:14;32:19;"you hear during like Kovat because so it was winter I'm not talking about winter the king"
32:19;32:24;"of starbuck I'm talking about this season but so it's winter New Year's in Havana all"
32:24;32:28;"these people down there partying and then you probably because it's winter you probably"
32:28;32:33;"had some other people up in like New England or something being like yeah we got a trip"
32:33;32:38;"down to Cuba planned for when the kids have February break so we're gonna go down about"
32:38;32:45;"six weeks and then just like early January 1960 where it's just kind of like people on"
32:45;32:51;"the phone to their travel agent just like my husband says that we can't go to Cuba until"
32:51;32:55;"they sort this whole thing out and just like I want a refund and like the travel agent"
32:55;32:59;"just being like ma'am I'm being assured by everybody that this Castro thing is gonna"
32:59;33:05;"blow over in about a month things will settle down and I promise you you and your family"
33:05;33:11;"will be enjoying the beaches of Cuba just as you planned by February like or it just"
33:11;33:17;"probably got crazier and crazier people like are we still going to Cuba is that hotel gonna"
33:17;33:21;"honor our deposit or not he's gonna reopen the casino soon right are they still doing"
33:21;33:29;"that seafood buffet just like people make international calls to like the revolutionaries"
33:29;33:34;"fully taking over just like some mafia hotel just like like the phone ringing just like"
33:34;33:40;"hello is there an English speaker I'm I'm scheduled to arrive in about two weeks so"
33:40;33:46;"anyway yeah I guess that that's kind of a classic thing it's like for everybody who"
33:46;33:51;"happens to be part of a world historical event because they're like one of the drivers of"
33:51;33:56;"that event they're a soldier or a politician or something or even just somebody who lives"
33:56;34:00;"in the city where something's happening you're also gonna just get people who are just like"
34:00;34:03;"man I'm just passing through so yeah I think we should get winter on the phone because"
34:03;34:10;"I'm very curious about where he's at now and what he's seen because everybody I know has"
34:10;34:15;"been been pretty quarantined and I want to hear from somebody who not only was out there"
34:15;34:20;"in the world but was traveling through the world so why don't we get winter on the phone"
34:20;34:31;"now let's go to the time crisis hotline hey folks how are you doing good to see you good"
34:31;34:37;"to see you good to see you winter well this is different yeah welcome to the the video"

36:03;36:09;"person but you're also the world's preeminent starbucker you pose as a first responder to"
36:09;36:15;"get into a starbucks i can categorically say that i would not pose as a first responder"
36:15;36:20;"to get into a starbucks but you know i like the creativity and thinking as rough i'm glad"
36:20;36:24;"to hear that that's what i expected but how about this usually your day job is computer"
36:24;36:30;"programming right that's where i am right now that's pretty much the only place i can"
36:30;36:36;"be in rochester and get wi-fi is work so would you consider temporarily becoming a first"
36:36;36:42;"responder for access to starbucks or leave it to the professionals yet another creative"
36:42;36:48;"idea i'll probably leave it to the professionals okay i have thought about changing my job"
36:48;36:52;"before like trying to become a journalist so i could get into saudi arabia or trying"
36:52;36:58;"to get into one of these buildings in manhattan that are restricted but i think uh during"
36:58;37:04;"a pandemic i need to just back off of the starbucking a little bit starbucks pause for"
37:04;37:05;"the moment"
37:05;37:25;"on the first part of the journey i was looking at all the life there were plants and birds"
37:25;37:54;"and the sky with no clouds the heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full"
37:54;37:59;"of life and the people were happy and the weather was nice and the people were happy."
37:59;38:05;"yeah a year and a half can i can't even believe that i was just telling jake how following"
38:05;38:11;"you on twitter it seemed like you were on a starbucking run just as the u.s started"
38:11;38:19;"to really have to deal with covet 19 yes so where were you and can you kind of just walk"
38:19;38:25;"us through the past few weeks of your life okay well this trip was pre-planned otherwise"
38:25;38:30;"i wouldn't have gone my mother's down at an assistant living facility in panama and my"
38:30;38:34;"cousins were getting married last saturday so i timed everything around going down to"
38:34;38:40;"see her taking her to the wedding buying all her medications and toiletries i get down"
38:40;38:46;"there last uh two wednesdays ago panama just got its first case of covet and they locked"
38:46;38:51;"down the nursing home so all i can do is run around buy her medications buy her toiletries"
38:51;38:55;"i'm still going to the wedding by myself your mom because she's in a nursing home she wasn't"
38:55;39:00;"even allowed to go to the family wedding too much of a risk you know she gets out just"
39:00;39:05;"kind of brings it back in it's deadly so i'm still going to the wedding up until friday"
39:05;39:12;"night government cancels all events so saturday morning i see the writing on the wall in terms"
39:12;39:17;"of airport lockdowns all over the place i rushed to the airport get myself on the first"
39:17;39:23;"flight back to orlando and sure enough two days later panama locks down nobody's getting"
39:23;39:28;"in so i got in just under the wire wow you got out of there in the nick of time why were"
39:28;39:34;"you flying to orlando and not all just back to rochester for work because my car is registered"
39:34;39:42;"in texas and texas is a yearly state inspection state other states are not but no matter where"
39:42;39:46;"i'm working every year around this time i gotta drop everything and drive back down"
39:46;39:51;"to texas to get the car inspected before the registration this year also happened to be"
39:51;39:58;"my uh 10 year license renewal which required certifying that my vision hadn't changed which"
39:58;40:06;"it had so i had to get glasses too so just a bunch of things that i had to do mandatory"
40:06;40:11;"as the country is shutting down which turned it into a whole surreal experience and i would"
40:11;40:17;"imagine that generally speaking because you're the world's preeminent starbucker a lot of"
40:17;40:23;"people would probably be like i got a wedding i gotta go do this i gotta get glasses and"
40:23;40:26;"go back to texas a lot of people would be like oh this is gonna be such an annoying"
40:26;40:33;"trip i imagine that as somebody so dedicated to starbucking as you there's a lot of silver"
40:33;40:37;"lining when you got all these errands to run around the world where you're kind of like"
40:37;40:40;"a lot of people like how am i gonna make this trip fun it's not and you're for you it's"
40:40;40:45;"like you're probably kind of happy because you always have starbucks to hit right in"
40:45;40:51;"normal times yes absolutely and for the first half of the trip that's exactly how it was"
40:51;40:59;"business as usual the only big change from starbucks was no reusable cups in the stores"
40:59;41:04;"which meant that i typically go in with a little sample cup i say hi to the manager"
41:04;41:08;"or the supervisor tell them what i'm doing and ask for a sample hand them the cup most"
41:08;41:11;"of the time they'll take it unless you're in a place like new york city where they don't"
41:11;41:17;"take any reusable cups they clamp down on that it still wasn't a problem the manager"
41:17;41:21;"supervisor still just went to the back and got me a little sample cup these first few"
41:21;41:26;"days though you're mostly in florida you just got into your car your car was in orlando"
41:26;41:31;"no no i drove down from upstate syracuse where i played in a scrabble tournament i drove"
41:31;41:36;"all the way down to florida so i was hitting starbucks in maryland virginia north carolina"
41:36;41:41;"south carolina georgia florida until i flew out okay so you're starbucking all the way"
41:41;41:46;"down to orlando you go to panama you have this kind of crazy experience get out of panama"
41:46;41:52;"in the nick of time back in orlando once you're back in orlando how much did things change"
41:52;41:57;"okay we've been hearing florida was relative has been relatively lax as a state first of"
41:57;42:04;"all my flight was delayed for over an hour because they had to pull a kid off the plane"
42:04;42:08;"and his dad the kid was crying because they'd heard him coughing in the bathroom so they"
42:08;42:12;"did a medical check and they pulled him off so that was interesting i arrived back in"
42:12;42:20;"orlando around 5 p.m and i immediately bolt to as many starbucks as i could at that time"
42:20;42:26;"i can still go in them and hang out charge my batteries charge my computer charge my"
42:26;42:31;"phone that's critical stuff for me talk to the managers or supervisors everything's fine"
42:31;42:36;"and in terms of like the number of people in these starbucks it felt like a typical"
42:36;42:43;"day absolutely uh the very last one that i went to in davenport florida was completely"
42:43;42:51;"busy business as usual what was the date around this was saturday march the 14th so saturday"
42:51;42:57;"march 14th you have some people beginning quarantine in the u.s but as far as the starbucks"
42:57;43:01;"that you're hitting in florida you wouldn't have guessed anything was happening exactly"
43:01;43:05;"everything was normal there was an email from kevin johnson several days later saying it"
43:05;43:12;"was a possibility that stores would move to grab and go or drive through only but i hadn't"
43:12;43:19;"heard of that happening kevin johnson is the ceo who replaced howard schultz oh okay well"
43:19;43:24;"sunday morning i wake up i go to my first starbucks in coincidentally enough winter"
43:24;43:31;"haven florida and i notice that something seems off there's no cars in the parking lot"
43:31;43:37;"there's a white piece of paper on the door i go up to the door and boom this store is"
43:37;43:44;"open to serve you uh for grab and go only and they have closed the restrooms grab and"
43:44;43:49;"go means you could still enter the store as usual just can't sit that's correct as soon"
43:49;43:54;"as i went to plug in my laptop on my phone the supervisor told me that i couldn't hang"
43:54;43:58;"out i said okay yeah i understand i'm just gonna get my coffee unfortunately i couldn't"
43:58;44:04;"use the restroom at that point by the way i'm thinking okay all thoughts of asking for"
44:04;44:09;"a sample are gone i'm just gonna have to suck it up and pay 225 for a coffee for however"
44:09;44:14;"many stores i go to in the next week you know it's not the end of the world it's a pandemic"
44:14;44:19;"so i adjust to the new reality but the bathroom thing you treated about this a little bit"
44:19;44:24;"generally when you starbucks you're not staying in hotels you'll sleep in the car most nights"
44:24;44:28;"that is correct so one of the first things i do to when i get that first starbucks in"
44:28;44:34;"the morning typically is i want to wash my hands i want to wash my face i just want to"
44:34;44:40;"wash up and during this pandemic when everybody was telling people not to touch their face"
44:40;44:45;"and to wash their hands i ramped that up so i was basically washing my hands every time"
44:45;44:50;"i went into a starbucks basically anytime i was anywhere and i touched anything i was"
44:50;44:54;"just washing my hands and all of a sudden i can't do that anymore and i'm like okay"
44:54;45:00;"i gotta adjust so my adjustment is stop for gas more often and use the uh the bathroom"
45:00;45:07;"there to wash my hands so two stores were like that third store further north that one"
45:07;45:13;"was still open for business different district different region so i learned that that one"
45:13;45:20;"from talking to the manager who was wearing an n95 mask because she had cystic fibrosis"
45:20;45:25;"so getting covid for her is a big deal oh god yeah so i really felt bad for her and"
45:25;45:28;"i understood why she was being so cautious but she decided that she was going to keep"
45:28;45:32;"the store open that day she was going to go the next day and basically i learned that"
45:32;45:38;"stores had been given until thursday to make the switch over to grab and go and some decided"
45:38;45:43;"to go immediately some decided to go a little bit later she explained that for some it had"
45:43;45:50;"to do with how many covid cases were reported in the area and the proximity so that's what"
45:50;45:55;"i discovered for the rest uh for the next few days some were open some weren't in some"
45:55;46:03;"cities like gainesville florida i actually met up with the brother of bill tangman who"
46:03;46:08;"directed the starbucking documentary back in 2007 so he's been following me but i was"
46:08;46:13;"able to hang out there and chat with him then i go to another store in gainesville it's"
46:13;46:14;"only open for grab and go"
46:14;46:25;"after two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red after three days in the desert"
46:25;46:48;"fun i was looking at a riverbed and the story you told of a river that told made me sad"
46:48;46:49;"to think it was dead you see i've been through the desert on a horse with no name it felt"
46:49;46:50;"good to be out of the rain in the desert you can't remember your name because there ain't"
46:50;46:58;"no one more to give you no pain so that's florida and georgia and alabama wasn't even"
46:58;47:04;"able to go to one in uh in alabama because it closed early don't know if that was related"
47:04;47:11;"to covid or if that was just a sunday closure uh panama here's funny thing panama city beach"
47:11;47:16;"was closed before i got there not because of covid but because they had a boil water"
47:16;47:22;"order in all of panama city beach so that was kind of ironic boil water order means"
47:22;47:27;"that there's something in the water supply meaning that you can't drink tap water that's"
47:27;47:32;"correct so all of the starbucks in panama city beach were shut down for several days"
47:32;47:37;"so i had to skip that one and head straight to new orleans and that was monday morning"
47:37;47:45;"16th and that was an interesting experience because the first starbucks that i went to"
47:45;47:51;"did not have a drive-through it was completely open but the managers were talking about how"
47:51;47:55;"they were going to be switching to a grab and go model and i was already starting to"
47:55;47:59;"wonder okay what's that going to do to the people who just hang out at starbucks new"
47:59;48:04;"orleans has a lot of indigent of course they'll hang out they'll charge their devices they'll"
48:04;48:10;"use the wi-fi so that's obviously going to affect them the next store that i went to"
48:10;48:16;"had already switched to grab and go but the next day it was switching to drive-through"
48:16;48:22;"only so they were getting ahead of the drive-through curve the third store i went to was on the"
48:22;48:28;"other side of the river in the algiers neighborhood that manager actually got a little bit snippy"
48:28;48:34;"with me i went in i plugged in my laptop my phone on the floor i wasn't really working"
48:34;48:38;"there i was just getting my coffee took a picture went back in asked her some questions"
48:38;48:42;"about where new orleans was going with this and after at some point i guess i wore out"
48:42;48:47;"my welcome and she said i'm gonna have to ask you to leave uh get your stuff and go"
48:47;48:52;"okay well you know in the middle of a pandemic people's nerves start to fray so i totally"
48:52;49:00;"understood that my next stop was more interesting that was congregation coffee in algiers point"
49:00;49:05;"a independent coffee shop that was actually selected by food and wine magazine uh last"
49:05;49:12;"year at their favorite coffee roaster in the state of louisiana there that gave me an opportunity"
49:12;49:17;"to talk to the owners about what they thought this pandemic was going to do the business"
49:17;49:22;"and the owner was quite frank and saying he didn't think they were going to make it to"
49:22;49:27;"the other side of this and that was something that i'd been reading already about how this"
49:27;49:32;"was going to start hurting small businesses and my focus is starbucks but i'm really trying"
49:32;49:37;"to promote and talk up the small coffee houses i have a keen interest in what's going to"
49:37;49:41;"happen to them and i feel really bad that a lot of them are not going to make it through"
49:41;49:45;"this pandemic so i was glad that i was able to give them a little bit of business for"
49:45;49:50;"a while and you know talk up his cafe i hope he sells a lot of beans because that's how"
49:50;49:54;"they're going to have to survive when they can't actually sell coffee with everything"
49:54;49:59;"closed you make a good point winter is that people talk so much about obviously this is"
49:59;50:05;"a very difficult time for restaurants and especially the people who work at restaurants"
50:05;50:09;"servers and things like that who are being let go they don't need the whole stuff i guess"
50:09;50:14;"the only thing you could hope for that at a restaurant there's still people ordering"
50:14;50:19;"food and they can still be preparing stuff but a coffee shop you know you're not going"
50:19;50:25;"to find a ton of people putting in big orders for coffee to be delivered to their homes"
50:25;50:30;"or something so even more than restaurants i can imagine that these kind of like cool"
50:30;50:36;"kind vibe little coffee shops independent ones are really going to be hit because outside"
50:36;50:41;"of selling beans what can they do so as you're making it through you're you're noticing the"
50:41;50:46;"tensions rising with some of the managers you're noticing things changing you barely"
50:46;50:50;"got out of panama you made it to florida you're traveling to the south by the time you're"
50:50;50:56;"in new orleans there must be a pretty big black cloud hanging over your whole trip do"
50:56;51:01;"you think about just bailing on the texas car stuff and just getting back to rochester"
51:01;51:07;"like did you kind of feel like the the doors were closing you know yes i did feel like"
51:07;51:12;"the doors were closing no i didn't consider uh bailing it's not an option i have to renew"
51:12;51:16;"my license i have to renew my registration or i'm going to get arrested at some point"
51:16;51:20;"i want to see my dentist under the wire and i need to get those glasses too because i'm"
51:20;51:25;"having trouble driving at night it's a safety issue so i was gonna go to texas no matter"
51:25;51:31;"what and the process was actually stressful typically starbucks is relaxing it's like"
51:31;51:36;"it's great i'm getting away from work i'm doing my thing i'm talking to the managers"
51:36;51:40;"um taking all these great pictures posting on instagram this time around it was just"
51:40;51:47;"a constant day by day how do i adapt to the new situation how do i keep my phone charged"
51:47;51:50;"how do i keep my laptops charged how do i keep my camera battery charged where do i"
51:50;51:56;"wash my hands all that kind of thing and as i kept traveling where do i eat what restaurants"
51:56;52:01;"are going to be closed that was pretty much the rest of the week for me as i was documenting"
52:01;52:09;"the slow rolling shutdown of the united states for essentially a seven-day period seeing"
52:09;52:16;"it from the front lines it was quite educational but it was also stressful and it was depressing"
52:16;52:22;"because i was seeing that all these people were starting to lose their jobs with all"
52:22;52:26;"these places closed and it's just going to be devastating for the people who work in"
52:26;52:31;"the service economy and i really really feel bad for them yeah seriously so by the time"
52:31;52:39;"you got to texas you were still able to accomplish all of your tasks you know your dentist and"
52:39;52:43;"optometrist and all this stuff yeah yeah i got everything done i you know checked in"
52:43;52:47;"on my dad just to see if he was okay you know didn't hug him didn't shake his hand tried"
52:47;52:52;"to stay a little bit away but you know he had his his issues a couple years ago and"
52:52;52:58;"i just needed to make sure that he was okay and not just saying he was okay over the phone"
52:58;53:06;"and then i left texas went up to dallas and by that point it was all grab and go so i"
53:06;53:10;"didn't get to see go into any of the starbucks in the dallas market and at that point i made"
53:10;53:17;"a decision that in keeping with the whole idea of social distancing i was going to put"
53:17;53:24;"a heavy emphasis on re-photographing old stores stores that i'd been to at night or stores"
53:24;53:29;"for which i'd lost the photograph when my computer was stolen etc etc that way i'd go"
53:29;53:34;"to fewer stores and i'd go to more remote stores so i went ahead and went out of the"
53:34;53:40;"way to college station texas where sadly you know one of your tc fans starbucking fans"
53:40;53:45;"wanted to meet me but i was supposed to meet people in dallas and college station in austin"
53:45;53:51;"and san antonio but because of the pandemic um right that just wasn't gonna happen right"
53:51;53:56;"exactly and that was that was sad because you know i feel like if if somebody's going"
53:56;54:01;"through the trouble of sending me an email and taking an interest in my starbucking project"
54:01;54:05;"you know i'm happy to have a cup of coffee with them and that just wasn't gonna happen"
54:05;54:11;"but this is the new reality that we live with um you know i went down from dallas market"
54:11;54:19;"all the way out to weatherford mineral wells down uh some towns outside of austin san antonio"
54:19;54:22;"all the way out to uvalde and then i decided that i was going to go ahead and drive all"
54:22;54:27;"the way out to uh el paso and you know some tc heads probably saw my tweet where i said"
54:27;54:35;"that with all the stress of adapting to the nation shutting down the seven hour drive"
54:35;54:39;"to el paso was actually the most relaxing part of my week because i didn't have to worry"
54:39;54:44;"about i mean it was about as socially isolated as you can get other than stopping for gas"
54:44;54:50;"it was just driving driving driving well it's funny because um anybody who's been a touring"
54:50;54:57;"musician or a resident of texas has at some point done the kind of epic drive from the"
54:57;55:02;"really dense populated part of texas i don't know if you call it east texas but you know"
55:02;55:06;"where all the big cities aren't that far away from each other they're within two to four"
55:06;55:11;"hours of each other and then you have this huge expanse of west texas until you get to"
55:11;55:17;"el paso which sometimes that drive feels like you're not seeing a lot of other cars you're"
55:17;55:23;"not seeing a lot of civilization there's only a handful of places to stop and jake actually"
55:23;55:26;"i may have done that drive for the first time with you jake when we were touring with dirty"
55:26;55:34;"projectors and i'm pretty sure this is a west texas to me is a very jake type place and"
55:34;55:39;"i'm pretty sure jake that you told me that cormick mccarthy who wrote the post-apocalyptic"
55:39;55:45;"novel the road was inspired by driving through west texas right i remember reading that he"
55:45;55:54;"had the idea for the road when he was staying at a motel in el paso with his infant son"
55:54;55:59;"and like looking out on the lights of el paso juarez and i think maybe having this like"
55:59;56:07;"very vulnerable baby like in his care and thinking about like yeah like just the barren"
56:07;56:13;"wilds out there right because west texas it's very beautiful but it feels very empty compared"
56:13;56:17;"to other parts of texas and yet i imagine even i'm sure he probably said it more eloquently"
56:17;56:22;"but i've also had this experience of being in el paso with actually with you jake i remember"
56:22;56:28;"the first time i ever had migas was at an i-hop in el paso i remember the i-hop at el"
56:28;56:33;"paso so we hit an i-hop in el paso a lot of touring musicians have but there's something"
56:33;56:39;"about being in el paso and then you look and you see juarez and i don't know if there's"
56:39;56:43;"any other obviously there's a lot of border cities in america i don't think there's any"
56:43;56:49;"cities as big as el paso on the u.s border where you can just see mexico quite so clearly"
56:49;56:54;"and you see that that big mountain that says la biblia es la verdad yeah and there is something"
56:54;57:00;"about being in el paso and you're staring at another country that also kind of reminds"
57:00;57:06;"you to how arbitrary and flimsy this idea of like these like civilizational ideas of"
57:06;57:12;"like borders are so i could imagine maybe that played some factor the west texas vibe"
57:12;57:15;"and then just kind of you're like looking across this imaginary border that means so"
57:15;57:19;"much to people and you're just like a few things change in the world this border is"
57:19;57:24;"meaningless you know it makes you think about like yeah civilization and all that kind of"
57:24;57:30;"[ __ ] so anyway it's uh it kind of seems almost mystical to me winter that u.n cormac"
57:30;57:36;"mccarthy he who wrote a post-apocalyptic novel you who had a somewhat apocalyptic starbucking"
57:36;57:42;"journey both end up in el paso like it kind of weird synergy to me that it all converged"
57:42;57:50;"in el paso his was post-apocalyptic mine was pre-apocalyptic yeah exactly you finally pulled"
57:50;57:56;"into the west texas town of el paso what was the vibe there i saw the four stores there"
57:56;58:02;"uh grab and go the uh partners were all kind of laid back whoa nope no bad wait there's"
58:02;58:09;"only four starbucks in el paso new ones four new starbucks okay all right right yeah how"
58:09;58:14;"many total do you know offhand oh geez uh just trying to make a mental image i would"
58:14;58:21;"say about 10 roughly don't quote me on that i have to check my database yeah i would have"
58:21;58:27;"guessed easily 20 interesting but i managed to clear them all out quick so quickly and"
58:27;58:32;"the reason that i went so fast was because either in el paso or maybe uvalde i think"
58:32;58:37;"it was a while day i was told by one of the partners that they were switching to the drive-through"
58:37;58:43;"model starting saturday nationwide right so that was my last shot and that's where we're"
58:43;58:50;"at now in terms of nationwide starbucks is for the past five days and saturday the 21st"
58:50;58:54;"they're all drive-through only yes except for that handful that for first responders"
58:54;59:10;"there were plants and birds and rocks and things there was sand and hills and rings"
59:10;59:21;"the ocean is a desert with its life underground and the perfect disguise above under the cities"
59:21;59:48;"you raised the question on twitter are they allowing pedestrians to use the drive-thru"
59:48;59:53;"yes i was hoping that somebody would chime in but uh nobody's given me an answer yet"
59:53;59:58;"i'm sure you don't know you're not hearing about it once this airs uh somebody who was"
59:58;01:00:02;"a starbucks partner and a tc fan will know the answer to that i guarantee you they're"
01:00:02;01:00:07;"not because that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen and i feel like isn't like a classic"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"stoner movie like the guy trying to walk through the jack-in-the-box drive through at two in"
01:00:11;01:00:16;"the morning and they're sir i've tried to do that before and i'm never being told like"
01:00:16;01:00:21;"sir you need to be in a car it's for your safety and you know to protect ourselves against"
01:00:21;01:00:27;"lawsuits i've also done that in fact i have you like i have a memory my mom telling me"
01:00:27;01:00:33;"some story about me being like a baby or a toddler i can't imagine where i guess a new"
01:00:33;01:00:39;"jersey i don't know she was somewhere pushing me in a stroller and she tried to hit a drive-thru"
01:00:39;01:00:45;"mcdonald's with a stroller i don't maybe she was thinking i'm not just a pedestrian i am"
01:00:45;01:00:53;"i have a vehicle that is but she's straight up reckless yeah that's actually kind of out"
01:00:53;01:00:59;"of character uh maybe i'm misremembering the story but she was not allowed to but yeah"
01:00:59;01:01:03;"you're probably right there must be rules that drives you or for cars only but that's"
01:01:03;01:01:06;"f**ked up what if you don't have a car but you really need a coffee i don't think there's"
01:01:06;01:01:12;"an answer to that i guess new times uh new reality but anyway i sped through el paso"
01:01:12;01:01:17;"for that reason i was hoping to make it all the way to uh santa fe so i could still see"
01:01:17;01:01:22;"that store from the inside that one was uh close it was just too far i made it to las"
01:01:22;01:01:27;"cruces and i posted that picture yeah i put i thought it was closer once i plotted it"
01:01:27;01:01:31;"out it was really far so that picture that i posted in las cruces was the last one that"
01:01:31;01:01:38;"i was able to take from inside starbucks uh it honestly i like i told the baristas i said"
01:01:38;01:01:41;"it it feels kind of sad it's gonna be my last time inside of starbucks for the foreseeable"
01:01:41;01:01:48;"future the only other picture of a mural that i was able to post during that trip was in"
01:01:48;01:01:53;"uh siloam springs arkansas i just happened and put it through the drive-thru window that"
01:01:53;01:01:58;"oh man that is a cool mural i really want to get a picture of it and then i thought"
01:01:58;01:02:03;"well you know it's like it's pretty well lit on the inside uh what happens if i just go"
01:02:03;01:02:09;"up to the door and shoot through the window the picture came out pretty nice but i do"
01:02:09;01:02:18;"have to wonder what the uh baristas were thinking i've had the cops called on me quite a few"
01:02:18;01:02:23;"times when i've been shooting the architecture of uh fast food restaurants and corporate"
01:02:23;01:02:29;"retail the one where i was really asking for it it was probably a year or two after 9 11"
01:02:29;01:02:33;"i set up uh it was in the middle of the night it was like 11 o'clock or midnight at a taco"
01:02:33;01:02:39;"bell in portland oregon and i set up like a camera on a tripod because it was dark out"
01:02:39;01:02:44;"right next to the drive-thru of a taco bell so like the people working at the drive-thru"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"and the customers going through could like it was clear i was like four feet away from"
01:02:48;01:02:53;"them so you're on this taco bell property yes i'm sort of like i was setting i'd set"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"the tripod up sort of like the legs of the tripod were sort of in and among like the"
01:02:57;01:03:02;"landscaping adjacent to the drive-thru i waved at everyone to kind of indicate that i was"
01:03:02;01:03:08;"like not like a psycho and i was like a perfectly like friendly person but people were like"
01:03:08;01:03:12;"really weirded out which i understand and there's a guy with a tripod shooting pictures"
01:03:12;01:03:19;"of you getting your food from a taco bell then the cop showed up and i just was like"
01:03:19;01:03:23;"hey i'm an artist i'm a photographer i'm just shooting this stuff did you have to like pull"
01:03:23;01:03:27;"up your website i don't think i did that but i did like get into a bit of an art history"
01:03:27;01:03:31;"talk i was like you know that famous painting by edward hopper the uh nighthawks of the"
01:03:31;01:03:36;"guys in the diner like sitting alone in the diner eating oh yeah there was a viral tweet"
01:03:36;01:03:42;"of that picture that's true that's true yeah right recently so the cops knew it yeah they're"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"sort of like okay yeah i get it i get it it's like this is like an update on that it's just"
01:03:46;01:03:51;"like a taco bell and then they're like okay i kind of get that you still have to pack"
01:03:51;01:03:55;"it up and leave taco bell is this is private property yeah have you had the cops called"

01:04:16;01:04:20;"gotta have you maybe especially during these quarantine times we have a lot of shows we're"
01:04:20;01:04:25;"doing a weekly we can really get into some deeper winter stories i mean but just real"
01:04:25;01:04:32;"quick i gotta ask there's something about a tripod that is kind of scary yeah and you"
01:04:32;01:04:38;"probably had like this big camera i had like a big weird old film camera because the tripod"
01:04:38;01:04:44;"it's like you know there's like those little tripods that snipers use okay it's i'm just"
01:04:44;01:04:52;"saying it's it's dark out it's not a million miles away from some sort of like military"
01:04:52;01:04:57;"equipment or you know just something like freaky but winter i mean i understand that"
01:04:57;01:05:02;"you're in a lot of different situations because you're constantly traveling but you're not"
01:05:02;01:05:07;"all you're rolling with is just in your cup and your phone really there's nothing um you're"
01:05:07;01:05:14;"not carrying a lot of gear with you no but i i do shoot in the us and canada i shoot"
01:05:14;01:05:22;"with uh dslr i don't set up a tripod anymore but you know i've learned i used to uh that"
01:05:22;01:05:26;"drew a lot of attention i finally decided that i just didn't need to do that um i used"
01:05:26;01:05:32;"to do it to try and get really nice photographs at night now what i do is uh i'll take the"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"photograph at night uh hold the camera in my hand it may be a little blurry but i'll"
01:05:35;01:05:40;"make a notation on my map to come back later and take another picture in the daylight you"
01:05:40;01:05:44;"know it's so funny this is how i found your work all those years ago winter because you"
01:05:44;01:05:49;"had that website starbuckseverywhere.net and you had thousands of photographs of starbucks"
01:05:49;01:05:55;"and i was really deep into that world as well for my own art practice and uh anyway it's"
01:05:55;01:06:01;"just funny like 15 years later we're talking about this yeah so crazy that uh we were in"
01:06:01;01:06:06;"uh where were we were in uh sylum springs arkansas that was the uh i think the only"
01:06:06;01:06:12;"uh one of two stores that i saw that day because everything was shutting down i also got to"
01:06:12;01:06:19;"see uh the new roastery for uh onyx coffee in uh rogers arkansas actually one of the"
01:06:19;01:06:24;"uh either tc fans or one of the people who saw the vice video sent me an email saying"
01:06:24;01:06:30;"hey i noticed that you've been to our old location you got to come and see this roastery"
01:06:30;01:06:35;"but that that was towards the tail end of the shutdown by that point most of the places"
01:06:35;01:06:40;"where i'm at are shut down even to the extent that discount tire i had to get my tire repaired"
01:06:40;01:06:46;"because i had a split in the slide wall they were only doing critical repairs they wanted"
01:06:46;01:06:51;"you to wait out in your car they wanted to minimize people in the lobby once you paid"
01:06:51;01:06:55;"like they didn't want you to wait inside the lobby they were slower than usual because"
01:06:55;01:07:00;"instead of the normal they pull your car into the bay they didn't want to get into people's"
01:07:00;01:07:04;"cars so they were having people pull their own cars into the bay wow this is in rogers"
01:07:04;01:07:09;"arkansas no that was clovis new mexico that was the uh that was the store that i saw after"
01:07:09;01:07:16;"las cruces so again i i took a route that took me through a remote store just to maximize"
01:07:16;01:07:23;"driving minimize social interaction wait so you drove from orlando to new mexico and then"
01:07:23;01:07:29;"from new mexico back to rochester new york yeah i did uh las cruces to rochester in roughly"
01:07:29;01:07:36;"two days ouch oh my god all right so just bring us to the end explain those two days"
01:07:36;01:07:41;"from new mexico to rochester new york what's that like 2 000 miles yeah yeah it's about"
01:07:41;01:07:46;"2 000 miles uh just you know pretty much all driving except for that stop in siloam springs"
01:07:46;01:07:53;"and the stop in uh tarahote indiana i had to skip bestis missouri because oh here's"
01:07:53;01:07:58;"something else on the starbucks front even though they were having their drive-thru stores"
01:07:58;01:08:03;"open they could not maintain all of them open because this is a really great thing that"
01:08:03;01:08:09;"starbucks said they committed to paying their partners for first two weeks and then they"
01:08:09;01:08:15;"extended that to 30 days even if they weren't willing to come in for safety so because of"
01:08:15;01:08:21;"that a city like springfield missouri where i stopped to reshoot some stores only had"
01:08:21;01:08:27;"one store open out of like six maybe and then lots of stores in the st louis market were"
01:08:27;01:08:33;"shut down including the one that i needed to see other stores had reduced hours so i"
01:08:33;01:08:38;"didn't get to see westfield indiana because it shut down early because of the slowdown"
01:08:38;01:08:43;"and so then my next final one was going to be reynoldsburg ohio it was supposed to shut"
01:08:43;01:08:47;"down at 10 p.m and i would have just barely made it like if i floored it all the way out"
01:08:47;01:08:52;"there but they were going to shut down early again because of a staffing issue so that"
01:08:52;01:08:59;"was pretty much the end of my fall apart starbucks tour crazy so my last question is just when"
01:08:59;01:09:02;"you're beelining it and you're doing an epic drive like that for two days how much are"
01:09:02;01:09:09;"you sleeping at night depends on whether it's an extended trip or whether i know i'm gonna"
01:09:09;01:09:14;"get a chance to catch up this time around i knew that once i got to my job in rochester"
01:09:14;01:09:19;"and rolled in like you know monday around lunchtime i could just check in put in a few"
01:09:19;01:09:25;"hours of work before i got tired and then catch up on sleep but if i'm like beelining"
01:09:25;01:09:31;"because i'm going to see a concert or because i'm going to a scrabble competition and then"
01:09:31;01:09:36;"beyond that i'm going to keep traveling i try not to push myself on the sleep too much"
01:09:36;01:09:43;"because it does screw up with your immune system and right now with the assumption that"
01:09:43;01:09:50;"possibly two-thirds of the american population are going to get this virus i want to have"
01:09:50;01:09:54;"a strong immune system so i can fight it off if i'm going to get it anyway i'm in new york"
01:09:54;01:10:00;"you know that new york is now the epicenter of covid in the u.s six as of yesterday six"
01:10:00;01:10:05;"percent of all global cases i happen to have lucked out that i'm in monroe county which"
01:10:05;01:10:11;"is rochester which had the of the big areas it had the lowest number but you know you"
01:10:11;01:10:15;"never know i just don't want to exhaust myself i want to stay healthy stay stress-free and"
01:10:15;01:10:20;"just fight off that virus when i get it hell yeah jake and i and most of the people that"
01:10:20;01:10:24;"uh were in direct contact with have basically been staying put quarantined the past couple"
01:10:24;01:10:28;"weeks so i can't even imagine being in the situation where you had to be on the road"
01:10:28;01:10:33;"and like you're kind of seeing these things in real time yeah it must have been a very"
01:10:33;01:10:37;"strange time to be out there on the road it was rather surreal i'm kind of glad that i"
01:10:37;01:10:42;"got to see it from the ground rather than seeing all these reports and i'm kind of glad"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"that i got to talk to the owners of some of these independent cafes because you know i'll"
01:10:46;01:10:52;"say it again my heart is really with america's small businesses i don't want to live in a"
01:10:52;01:10:58;"country that's all starbucks and mcdonald's and best buy and walmart uh yeah when we get"
01:10:58;01:11:05;"to the other side of this yep true word absolutely well glad you made it yeah you keep staying"
01:11:05;01:11:09;"safe and we'll check in with you real soon because we got plenty more to talk about all"

01:11:20;01:11:25;"with trunks of memories still to come"
01:11:25;01:11:33;"we found things to do in stormy weather"
01:11:33;01:11:37;"long may you run"
01:11:37;01:11:43;"long may you run"
01:11:43;01:11:47;"long may you run"

01:11:51;01:11:59;"with your chrome hearts shining in the sun"
01:11:59;01:12:04;"long may you run"
01:12:04;01:12:07;"time crisis with ezra koenig"
01:12:07;01:12:09;"this show rules"
01:12:09;01:12:16;"so jake on a previous episode we talked about you putting together a new playlist for all"
01:12:16;01:12:21;"the tc heads who are quarantined yeah or if they're not quarantined they're out there"
01:12:21;01:12:27;"putting their necks on the line for other people so no matter what people need some"
01:12:27;01:12:32;"good music and you put together the old wisdom playlist i can't remember what exactly was"
01:12:32;01:12:36;"the prompt i remember we were talking about that now's a good time to dig into some of"
01:12:36;01:12:41;"that older music and try to draw some of that older wisdom out of it what did you go into"
01:12:41;01:12:46;"making this playlist with what were your parameters yeah i mean i guess it's a little bit of an"
01:12:46;01:12:53;"open-ended prompt i ended up finding music that i thought sort of addressed hardship"
01:12:53;01:12:59;"and difficulty and struggle but at the end of the day was sort of like redemptive in"
01:12:59;01:13:05;"its own like the music is not despairing did you keep it explicitly in 1970s no"
01:13:05;01:13:11;"it's 60s and 70s heavy i mean it's me you know oh yeah i just i saw there's some little"
01:13:11;01:13:14;"wings in there so you made all the way to the 2000s yeah yeah there was like a silver"
01:13:14;01:13:20;"g song a little wing song just songs that i just felt like yeah like acknowledge some"
01:13:20;01:13:25;"like struggle and hardship but also kind of saw light at the end of the tunnel it's a"
01:13:25;01:13:31;"loose prompt yeah see we got a lot of some good country some 80s bonnie rate ricky nelson"
01:13:31;01:13:36;"garden party i got really into that song recently actually yeah that's a great song you know"
01:13:36;01:13:42;"that's a song he wrote about playing in manhattan square garden i know it's such a witty title"
01:13:42;01:13:46;"yeah i was reading about it that basically ricky nelson he was really big in like the"
01:13:46;01:13:51;"he was on tv and he was the early rock and roll guy who's also known as an actor so he's"
01:13:51;01:13:57;"really big in the 50s and like early 60s yeah and i guess by the 70s he was probably saying"
01:13:57;01:14:04;"well it's official buddy i'm a has been yeah to his personal assistant yeah very rick dalton"
01:14:04;01:14:10;"doubt yeah but so ricky nelson he was a bit of a has been by the 70s but you know you're"
01:14:10;01:14:16;"still like this kind of early rock and roll guy and i guess he went to a um some kind"
01:14:16;01:14:22;"of like rock and roll revival kind of fun nostalgia event with some really big names"
01:14:22;01:14:28;"at madison square garden everybody from bob dylan john lennon were there some early rock"
01:14:28;01:14:34;"and roll greats and he went on stage and at some point he got booed by the audience and"
01:14:34;01:14:38;"do you remember the story jake it's like some people claim that he misunderstood what the"
01:14:38;01:14:42;"booing was for he felt like they were booing him because he was a has been they didn't"
01:14:42;01:14:46;"want to hear him but really they were booing something else yeah i don't remember that"
01:14:46;01:14:52;"part i remember just having sort of a vague awareness that the show didn't go that well"
01:14:52;01:14:56;"and he wrote a song about it and then yeah he was sort of skeptical of this whole like"
01:14:56;01:15:02;"retro kind of like revival like rock and roll revival nostalgia act and he's just sort of"
01:15:02;01:15:09;"like if memories were all i sang i'd rather drive a truck yeah but like the chorus is"
01:15:09;01:15:14;"sort of like you can't please everyone so you gotta please yourself yeah it's a good"
01:15:14;01:15:18;"advice it's sort of like you have to follow your own instinct and your own gut and don't"
01:15:18;01:15:22;"be beholden to other people's opinions it's like saying you gotta roll with the punches"
01:15:22;01:15:27;"like there's always gonna be somebody that's got an issue with you there's always gonna"
01:15:27;01:15:31;"be something in life that bothers you and you just gotta keep on trucking and just like"
01:15:31;01:15:36;"madison square garden calling it garden party yeah i actually thought of you when i because"
01:15:36;01:15:41;"i actually read about that song somewhat recently i mean i've loved that song for decades but"
01:15:41;01:15:46;"somehow i ended up on the well i was listening to some ricky nelson full-length records from"
01:15:46;01:15:51;"the early 70s which are pretty good and then i ended up on the garden party wikipedia page"
01:15:51;01:15:56;"and i was like oh that's so witty and i totally thought of you oh really i was like someone"
01:15:56;01:16:01;"that would appreciate that sort of like pun oh yeah no absolutely it's so funny i really"

01:17:32;01:17:35;"maybe because we don't want to make him like feel embarrassed but he you know he's kind"
01:17:35;01:17:41;"of a he's a legend of of music and jake you've been friends with him and a fan for a long"
01:17:41;01:17:46;"time so maybe you can uh contextualize and tell us a little bit about one of his signature"
01:17:46;01:17:52;"songs look at what the light did now i've been a fan but also a band member for years"
01:17:52;01:17:56;"oh right yeah yeah kyle thinks of the band as sort of uh because there's a lot of local"
01:17:56;01:18:01;"gigs in socal but he kind of thinks of the band as sort of like a men's softball league"
01:18:01;01:18:05;"it's sort of like if you can show up and play i'd love to have you but if you can't make"
01:18:05;01:18:10;"it i get it practice on tuesday nights little wings is absolutely no practice ever it's"

01:18:15;01:18:19;"show yeah look at what the light did now i mean i put it on the old wisdom playlist because"
01:18:19;01:18:24;"it's like what's more wise than sort of like taking a second to acknowledge the beauty"
01:18:24;01:18:31;"of the world a lot of the lyrics of the verses are like pretty trippy like kyle lyrics it's"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"not like a super specific story the way like garden party is he's having a lot of fun with"
01:18:35;01:18:41;"language gotta like ghost that girly gleaming taste the taste i taste till it's tasted i"
01:18:41;01:18:47;"love that to me it's sort of like when you like step out let's say you're in a starbucks"
01:18:47;01:18:51;"and then you step out into the parking lot and it's just like just a beautiful hour of"
01:18:51;01:18:56;"the day and the light is catching the trees and like the light is catching the like windshield"
01:18:56;01:19:02;"of this like suv in this like really beautiful way yeah really thing about this song it's"
01:19:02;01:19:07;"interesting because yeah when you look at it you hear these verses that are very strange"
01:19:07;01:19:11;"and impressionistic but he's always alternating with look at what the light did now yeah and"
01:19:11;01:19:15;"this song it's like it's really like a beloved song for like the people who know it it's"
01:19:15;01:19:19;"not just like oh that's a cool little wing song it's like people who like know this song"
01:19:19;01:19:23;"it's often like one of their favorite songs ever i've been to a wedding where this was"
01:19:23;01:19:28;"uh performed by i think feist was at the wedding i think she sang it at the wedding during"
01:19:28;01:19:34;"the ceremony oh wow and she so feist has a well-known cover there's another cover that"
01:19:34;01:19:39;"flo morrissey and matthew e white oh yeah that's a more recent cover racking up some"
01:19:39;01:19:43;"streams and it's interesting because yeah you pull out some of these lines and they're"
01:19:43;01:19:48;"interesting language but it's hard to know what it what to make of it and it's not a"
01:19:48;01:19:53;"song that's straightforwardly about like you know the songs like a lot you know a lot of"
01:19:53;01:19:57;"our favorite songs of all time often are about like the ones that really cut to the core"
01:19:57;01:20:01;"of what it means to be human being tend to be about like heartbreak or something but"
01:20:01;01:20:06;"this is it's yeah it's very zen it's very haiku-esque yeah there's no one line that's"
01:20:06;01:20:11;"like a perfect like yearbook quote that's just like man see this is what life is all"
01:20:11;01:20:17;"about but taken as a whole i love your interpretation that it is just kind of like pausing for these"
01:20:17;01:20:22;"like beautiful ephemeral moments of life and kind of realizing like sometimes that's all"
01:20:22;01:20:28;"it is yeah there's not always a grand narrative and sometimes you're in a weird mood or you're"
01:20:28;01:20:32;"in pain or something and then sometimes life is just the meaning of life can feel as simple"
01:20:32;01:20:37;"as just like oh oh yeah look at that little thing the light bouncing or something so i"
01:20:37;01:20:42;"definitely think it's a very appropriate choice for the old wisdom playlist yeah and it completely"
01:20:42;01:20:47;"relates to sort of my own art making over the last 20 years too which is you know the"
01:20:47;01:20:52;"core of what i do is basically like just beautiful daylight against the facade of like a toys"
01:20:52;01:20:58;"r us or something right i mean for a painter it's all about light yeah you think about"
01:20:58;01:21:03;"light in a way that we all care about light but you have a whole like language and you"
01:21:03;01:21:09;"have to really analyze light for your work yeah exactly i think it's like the most beautiful"
01:21:09;01:21:15;"thing you can do in in art the people that have done it really well over the millennia"
01:21:15;01:21:21;"are my favorite so you know anyway so that song was always had a real kind of personal"
01:21:21;01:21:27;"connection for me it's also a great quarantine song because it's like right obviously we're"
01:21:27;01:21:32;"comparing it to like a zen way of thinking but a lot of us who maybe you know don't like"
01:21:32;01:21:37;"this idea of being stuck somewhere because there's nothing to do here and i'm missing"
01:21:37;01:21:41;"something else you know obviously there's a lot of meditative practices that are kind"
01:21:41;01:21:46;"of about like man everything you need is inside like you can go real deep without going anywhere"
01:21:46;01:21:52;"and in a way thinking about like these small things that might be happening in an apartment"
01:21:52;01:21:57;"or a house or a backyard or through a window if you don't have a backyard that literally"
01:21:57;01:22:02;"are just like these little small things with like light and these tiny things that on on"
01:22:02;01:22:07;"a day when you have to go all over the city or all over drive somewhere you wouldn't think"
01:22:07;01:22:11;"about these small things that happen over the course of a day through a window so it's"
01:22:11;01:22:15;"yeah it's also really good just like stuck in one place song because there's not that"
01:22:15;01:22:18;"much to do you might as well look at what the light did now"
01:22:18;01:22:24;"hair it like a pounce upon a pico look at what the light did now"
01:22:24;01:22:30;"bear it like a bounce upon the beco look at what the light did now"
01:22:30;01:22:36;"land and water and bird or beast oh look at what the light did now"
01:22:36;01:22:42;"shiny little band or golden fleece oh look at what the light did now"
01:22:42;01:22:48;"look at what the light did now look at what the light did now"
01:22:48;01:22:52;"look at what the light did now"
01:22:52;01:23:10;"great song and also shout out to Kyle who made it onto from the freezer which I'm sure"
01:23:10;01:23:16;"most TC heads know about from the freezer is a great Instagram account that"
01:23:16;01:23:22;"showcases a lot of like fan made bootleg t-shirts and art objects and"
01:23:22;01:23:28;"things like that related to time crisis vampire weekend Jake Mountain Bruce and there's"
01:23:28;01:23:34;"these great pictures that Kyle took or somebody took a Kyle wearing the Mountain"
01:23:34;01:23:40;"Bruce long sleeve shirt that's in the style of the Patagonia logo which I think from the freezer actually made himself"
01:23:40;01:23:46;"and I was like that's definitely one of the best things I've seen I love seeing Kyle it looks great on him"
01:23:46;01:23:52;"everything about it is perfect well anyway everybody check out the old wisdom playlist it's on"
01:23:52;01:23:58;"Apple Music and Seinfeld you'll get this to the people yes thanks Seinfeld Seinfeld's"
01:23:58;01:24:04;"diligently crunching numbers he's got himself on mute for most of the show we appreciate that so now"
01:24:04;01:24:10;"we're gonna have a little check-in with another friend of the show Kazzy David Seinfeld you've been in touch with Kazzy"
01:24:10;01:24:16;"much lately not a whole lot just you know reached out to her to invite her on the show but"
01:24:16;01:24:22;"you know she wrote something recently about being a germaphobe that seems very apropos"
01:24:22;01:24:28;"so she's been a long time germaphobe alright let's get her on the horn now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
01:24:28;01:24:40;"yo friend of the show Kazzy David welcome back so Kazzy how long have you been quarantined"
01:24:40;01:24:48;"and are you taking it seriously so I started quarantining a week earlier than everyone else really did"
01:24:48;01:24:56;"because I wanted to stay with my dad so had to start early you know just in case if I went over the line"
01:24:56;01:25:02;"would never be able to see him again you know what I mean right and I've been here for about"
01:25:02;01:25:10;"17 days and it's just the two of you it's me him and his girlfriend okay three people yeah three of us"
01:25:10;01:25:16;"but I am um let's just say I'm doing most of the household chores well somebody's got to be the team leader"
01:25:16;01:25:24;"exactly and are you ordering in food much we're trying not to at all we did it once"
01:25:24;01:25:30;"but you know you have to disinfect the containers it's a whole thing it's a whole thing but Kazzy you wrote"
01:25:30;01:25:37;"something recently about how you're an OG germaphobe have you always been like a hardcore hand washer"
01:25:37;01:25:45;"yeah Pureller I stayed away from Purell you know but um I always remember everything I've touched"
01:25:45;01:25:50;"I never touch door handles never touch anything that other people have touched and if I do immediately"
01:25:50;01:25:57;"remember until I get to the sink and then I can forget about it but yeah it just seemed like you know"
01:25:57;01:26:03;"everyone just like hopped on board my train that was you know we've been doing this forever"
01:26:03;01:26:09;"I know some serious germaphobes who feel like the world finally caught up to them yeah I know a decent amount of people"
01:26:09;01:26:15;"who always were like it's annoying you got to spend this extra money on wipes but every time you fly"
01:26:15;01:26:20;"wipe down your seat wipe down and it always be like really and be like there's so many people coming in and out of those"
01:26:20;01:26:26;"they don't have time to clean the planes in between and some people always do that and it definitely felt"
01:26:26;01:26:35;"for a long time was considered very extra to be the person of course I would have loved to wear a mask to an airport"
01:26:35;01:26:43;"like to wear gloves to an airport I mean I wish but I also have deep shame so it's either one or the other you know"
01:26:43;01:26:47;"do you have any advice for people because I found this like washing my hands so much these days"
01:26:47;01:26:54;"my wrists are all messed up yeah they're like all like kind of red and like I've been putting"
01:26:54;01:27:01;"I've been putting on before yep I never used to be somebody who like like I was was very annoyed when I'd go into a"
01:27:01;01:27:10;"bathroom at like a fancy restaurant or hotel where they would have the soap right next to the hand cream by the sink"
01:27:10;01:27:16;"have you guys ever had this experience that you're at like a bougie or place that has hand cream the water's running"
01:27:16;01:27:22;"and you put this on your hands and you're like oh this is hand cream obviously there's nothing disgusting about hand cream"
01:27:22;01:27:27;"but it feels a little bit gross when you're expecting soap and then you got to double up on the soap but anyway now I kind of"
01:27:27;01:27:33;"realize yeah like your hands and your wrists can get dried out like crazy I took out the garbage today and I was so freaked out"
01:27:33;01:27:42;"that I washed my hands with dishwashing soap like palm olive and it like burned off the outer layer of my skin on my hands"
01:27:42;01:27:49;"it was so rough something's gonna happen to human evolution like with all this no seriously not only are you throwing this"
01:27:49;01:27:56;"new virus at humanity you're throwing a whole new set of protocols at people who normally don't do it there's gonna be all"
01:27:56;01:28:03;"sorts of weird unexpected things but uh Seinfeld I thought palm olive used to be marketed in like the 50s to housewives"
01:28:03;01:28:09;"and being like and it makes your hands feel amazing didn't there used to be like women's hands on the labels of palm olive"
01:28:09;01:28:16;"I think there still are ladies hands on the palm olive bottle oh no no it's so it's a woman's hand holding a glass but it still"
01:28:16;01:28:23;"harkens back is the hand look attractive or is it kind of red and bleeding and looks like it's been dipped in acid"
01:28:23;01:28:32;"there's like a bone sticking out of one of the no it's a zombie no it's like a beautiful so you're saying that it's a beautiful"
01:28:32;01:28:43;"hand you're saying that a dish so that's marketed literally on the label has a beautiful woman's hand holding a glass for you"
01:28:43;01:28:51;"it burned your hands that's correct and actually I'm zooming in here on the bottle and it says tough on grease soft on hands"
01:28:51;01:28:59;"I think that's false advertising maybe you bought their April Fool's Day edition it shelves a week early that's tough on hands"
01:28:59;01:29:08;"soft on grease this is pure acid so Kazzy as a germaphobe I gotta ask because we were discussing earlier that for me what I find"
01:29:08;01:29:16;"stressful is not being at home I'm stressed out for the fate of humanity for all the people worrying about money and their jobs"
01:29:16;01:29:23;"and getting sick that stuff really stresses me out but being stuck at home it's just who gives a sh*t like I mean look I'm if"
01:29:23;01:29:29;"somebody's like I hate being stuck at home because I'm stuck with somebody I got a real problem with like obviously that's a"
01:29:29;01:29:36;"different category but yeah just the idea of being stuck in one place who are giving suggestions for what we should be doing with"
01:29:36;01:29:45;"our time like online like watch movies like I read a book FaceTime with your friends like obviously what?"
01:29:45;01:29:52;"yeah well to me it's not even about not being bored it's like the real question is what are things you can do to not be"
01:29:52;01:30:01;"stressed right because it's a stressful time and yeah if you spend all day reading the news especially via social media you"
01:30:01;01:30:08;"might be a little bit harshed out but so I guess for you does being kind of like a homebody and a germaphobe go hand in hand?"
01:30:08;01:30:16;"listen always been a homebody always been a germaphobe always been anxious this is just like a day you know there's nothing"
01:30:16;01:30:24;"my lifestyle really hasn't changed besides being more stressed for the fate of humanity and everyone who's in so much worse off"
01:30:24;01:30:33;"positions you know but otherwise it's like yeah just like welcome chaos of for you it's not personal stress because you're"
01:30:33;01:30:39;"already been a germaphobe and homebody it's stress for everybody else yeah that's how I feel"
01:30:39;01:30:44;"do you guys struggle with a pressure to feel quote productive?"
01:30:44;01:30:52;"you know I think I'm also lucky on that front because I always have the same feeling because as a musician and a songwriter"
01:30:52;01:30:59;"there's always this feeling of like well I could be like writing some lyrics right now I could be like listening to music is research"
01:30:59;01:31:06;"so basically I feel like the low-level stress that I have constantly at any given moment being like what's the next album gonna"
01:31:06;01:31:13;"sound like which old demos do I have do I think have legs yeah that never goes away so I feel the exact same that I would have felt"
01:31:13;01:31:20;"one month ago six months ago three years ago if anything I'm probably pretty soon right now I feel the same as I always do"
01:31:20;01:31:26;"pretty soon I think I'll probably start to be like you know I think a lot of people already feel this way things that seemed important"
01:31:26;01:31:31;"a month ago a year ago seem less important now so I have to imagine that"
01:31:31;01:31:39;"it also feels like every person's productivity level has been put to a halt you know so if anything we're like people who have always worked at home"
01:31:39;01:31:47;"or like written or whatever are kind of fast forwarding through while everyone else is you know furthering their careers"
01:31:47;01:31:56;"everyone's kind of been put to a stop right now and then everyone who writes and you know is a songwriter does something like that gets to continue on"
01:31:56;01:32:04;"with what they would normally do do you feel like that at all I think I'll still get my little ideas here and there and just like on any day I'll go work on a little bit"
01:32:04;01:32:13;"but I definitely feel to some extent like for better for worse when I think about the album format and to some extent the song format"
01:32:13;01:32:24;"I feel like it's a it's like a snapshot of a moment in time and we're all taking in so much information right now that I kind of feel like yeah maybe scribble down little ideas"
01:32:24;01:32:32;"but I think in the future I'll have a better idea of like what to do with it this kind of seems like a time to like chill think right observe"
01:32:32;01:32:40;"there's something like pretty funny to me about like you know we know that whatever happens there will be a better time than right now"
01:32:40;01:32:47;"whether it's sooner than we hope whether it's later than we hope we know there will be a better time than right now and at that time we'll want just like funny"
01:32:47;01:32:55;"lightweight comedy and we'll want like feel-good songs about like going down to Dino's Bar and Grill or some sh*t like that"
01:32:55;01:33:03;"but the idea of like sitting down to like write them right now which seems like yeah hilarious just being like you know a year from now people just want some feel-good sh*t"
01:33:03;01:33:13;"so like I'm gonna work on a song that's like about like you know really about like part of high-fiving everybody at the bar you know like I think it's okay to just chill and observe"
01:33:13;01:33:26;"but the amount of quarantine content that have come out in the last two weeks oh my god it's like a race I mean everyone has already an Instagram live show"
01:33:26;01:33:39;"they're making quarantine songs I just think it's well yeah exactly I do think it is a time to chill and not be I don't know it kind of is overwhelming the amount of stuff that we're"
01:33:39;01:33:47;"that are being thrown out like the podcast and the internet radio shows internet radio shows well let's see one thing I like about this show is that"
01:33:47;01:33:55;"no disrespect to the TC heads because we do care about you and we hope that this show brings you some joy and sense of community when you listen to it"
01:33:55;01:34:04;"but even before it goes out to you just us recording it it's kind of just this this has always been the case with Sound Crisis when we just hang out and talk"
01:34:04;01:34:12;"I do kind of stop thinking too much about like some of the mundane problems of life because you're just like hanging out we're hanging out just enjoying each other's company"
01:34:12;01:34:18;"so even if um after we recorded this the producers dragged the session to the trash can"
01:34:18;01:34:31;"and then come see come see what happened huh what's that your glasses are on the floor okay all right we have a special special guest"
01:34:31;01:34:43;"who are these people hey oh hey how you doing can you see me yeah this is Time Crisis this is a don't worry it's not live this is a an internet radio show that's going to air on Sunday"
01:34:43;01:34:55;"who's talking now which one this is him that's he's talking oh this is Ezra we're just talking to Kazzy about being a head of the curve as a germaphobe in the pre-corona times"
01:34:55;01:35:02;"I couldn't help but think actually watching this season of Curb with the Purell on the table you also were a bit ahead of the curve"
01:35:02;01:35:10;"yeah just a bit right I know a lot of people have mentioned that to me Purell's become like a symbol of the era"
01:35:10;01:35:19;"you know what's really funny is I'm sure people have said this to you too a lot of people cooped up at their houses were watching old movies old tv shows like"
01:35:19;01:35:25;"I was telling them I've just been watching The Apartment the Billy Wilder movie where Jack Lemmon has like a cold through the whole thing"
01:35:25;01:35:32;"and you watch it in this time and he's going to work with his cold and everybody's shaking hands and it's like disgusting"
01:35:32;01:35:44;"it looks like you're like what is this savagery I'm watching and then the only thing that in these quarantine times that actually seemed like correct was Curb with the Purell on the table everything else seems nasty"
01:35:44;01:35:55;"well I've been talking about it shaking for a long time how wrong that is there was a time when I was grabbing people's elbows I thought the fist bump was a good new development"
01:35:55;01:36:06;"there's just you know there's too much contact between people even sex it's enough people got to do something about the sex"
01:36:06;01:36:14;"how early were you anti-handshake like are we talking like 90s or even like"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"yeah 90s yes for sure yeah"
01:36:17;01:36:20;"people have a real well this is one thing this is a huge game changer"
01:36:20;01:36:21;"this is Ezra"
01:36:21;01:36:26;"Ezra okay how come you're the only one doing the talking what are the other people doing"
01:36:26;01:36:35;"you know this is really it's a delicate balance so it takes a while to hear and then you have to wait for it to be you know everyone"
01:36:35;01:36:37;"what's your last name Ezra"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"uh Koenig"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"K-O-E-N-I-G"
01:36:41;01:36:42;"yeah"
01:36:42;01:36:46;"there was a shortstop on the 1927 Yankees named Mark Koenig are you a relation"
01:36:46;01:36:53;"you know my family's from the Bronx but I think I would have heard if somebody was on the Yankees so probably not"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"1927 look it up"
01:36:55;01:37:00;"yeah but no you're right I am doing most of the talking should also introduce you to my co-host Jake Longstreth"
01:37:00;01:37:01;"hey Larry"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"he's an American painter"
01:37:03;01:37:07;"and then you probably heard of Seinfeld 2000 as Kazi explained"
01:37:07;01:37:08;"I have yes"
01:37:08;01:37:09;"Seinfeld 2000"
01:37:09;01:37:15;"yes yes I've heard of it it's updated for texting and things like that right"

01:37:28;01:37:35;"all right I'm a real teen right now you guys"
01:37:35;01:37:38;"so he just came into your bedroom just to see what was going on"
01:37:38;01:37:42;"he loves a pop-in especially from the hours of 8 to 10"
01:37:42;01:37:51;"are you guys doing like any kind of set not for creativity or anything like that but any kind of like set schedule things just for like the order of the household"
01:37:51;01:37:55;"like are you guys doing like let's all sit down for lunch or dinner is there anything like that"
01:37:55;01:38:03;"we always have dinner together I forgot about this because I haven't lived here in so long but his disposition is really surprising"
01:38:03;01:38:08;"he's always in a good mood he always like is a great greeter in the morning"
01:38:08;01:38:14;"and I'm all I'm like a teenager I'm like always like moody walking around moping around"
01:38:14;01:38:19;"but it is surprising he's just like always in a good mood really excited for the next day"
01:38:19;01:38:31;"well that's great I mean and also famously people revert to their child or teen vibes when they're in the same house as their parents"
01:38:31;01:38:32;"right"
01:38:32;01:38:34;"do you feel like you become more of a moody teen"
01:38:34;01:38:38;"that's just my permanent state of being I think so no for me"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"out forever moody teen"
01:38:40;01:38:46;"well what do you got lined up for the rest of the week doing more internet radio shows"
01:38:46;01:38:54;"my favorite thing I've been doing is watching the excuses of how people are posting photos right now"
01:38:54;01:39:01;"and what excuses they're using to post and how that's gonna change and evolve over the next"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"that's interesting because"
01:39:02;01:39:03;"wait what do you mean"
01:39:03;01:39:06;"so everyone's always desperate to post Instagrams right"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"so desperate"
01:39:07;01:39:14;"of course so right before corona hit everyone was getting their last post in knowing that they weren't allowed to post like during corona"
01:39:14;01:39:17;"and it was probably gonna be their last time ever"
01:39:17;01:39:24;"now you're seeing a lot of you know miss these times with my friends if you guys social distance soon we can do this again"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"stuff like that you know what I'm talking about"
01:39:26;01:39:31;"yeah the posts that are kind of like oh remember when we did all this miss you guys can't wait to see that kind of thing"
01:39:31;01:39:37;"we'll be able to do this under the guise of you know alerting the public helping people"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"yeah"
01:39:38;01:39:46;"oh it's just interesting to watch that happen watch all these celebrities kind of unravel and that's kind of what I'm doing with my time"
01:39:46;01:39:47;"just watching it all"
01:39:47;01:39:54;"yeah no absolutely I think this is a great time to just observe observe and report"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"totally"
01:39:56;01:40:15;"and totally would like the celebrities thing too is like it's only gonna get weirder but I've had the thought seeing one or two kind of strange celebrity things is like it is a very strange time when everybody is just like on their phone so it is a little bit like"
01:40:15;01:40:30;"we're all civilians now you know there's no like going out and getting your photo taken and being in outfits like everyone's just a person I've noticed that it's started to drive some people crazy"
01:40:30;01:40:45;"you know guys we used to joke to some extent about how this isn't a podcast and it being an internet radio show made it a very ethical form of content but it especially feels that way now I don't know why"
01:40:45;01:40:48;"it feels like we're facetiming"
01:40:48;01:40:53;"well I'm glad that when your dad came in was like what the hell is this that we could say it's an internet radio show sir"
01:40:53;01:40:59;"I feel like if we had been like it's a podcast you would have been like ahhh"
01:40:59;01:41:03;"it really did make it feel like a like a"
01:41:03;01:41:08;"no but I like that it was an internet radio show but it's not live"
01:41:08;01:41:11;"it's a pre-recorded internet radio also"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"it's very confusing"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"it's for school"
01:41:14;01:41:21;"this has never happened on time crisis that somebody came into their daughter's bedroom and said what are you talking to"
01:41:21;01:41:27;"we could say proudly sir this is a pre-recorded internet radio show on Apple"
01:41:27;01:41:31;"alright well we'll check in with you again soon"
01:41:31;01:41:32;"ok thank you guys"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"keep observing and reporting"
01:41:34;01:41:35;"absolutely"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"bye Kazzy"
01:41:36;01:41:37;"thanks so much"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"bye"
01:41:38;01:41:50;"I won't say I love you babe, won't say I need you babe, but I'm gonna get you babe and I will not do you wrong"
01:41:50;01:41:57;"living's mostly wasting time and I waste my share of mine"
01:41:57;01:42:03;"but it never feels too good so let's don't take too long"
01:42:03;01:42:09;"you're soft as glass and I'm a gentle man"
01:42:09;01:42:16;"we got the sky to talk about and the world to lie upon"
01:42:16;01:42:28;"days up and down they come like rain on a conga drum"
01:42:28;01:42:34;"forget most remember some but don't turn none away"
01:42:34;01:42:41;"everything is not enough and nothing is too much to bear"
01:42:41;01:42:47;"where you been is good and gone all you keep's the getting there"
01:42:47;01:42:53;"well to live's to fly all low and high"
01:42:53;01:42:59;"so shake the dust off of your wings and the sleep out of your eyes"
01:42:59;01:43:01;"well that was a cool call"
01:43:01;01:43:05;"friend of the show Kazzy David and unexpected Larry David pop in"
01:43:05;01:43:08;"but that's just what happens in these quarantine times"
01:43:08;01:43:09;"you never know who you're gonna get"
01:43:09;01:43:13;"we got one more call to check in and it's friend of the show Tim Heidecker"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"so why don't we get Tim on the horn"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"now let's go to the time crisis hotline"
01:43:22;01:43:23;"yo"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Tim welcome back to time crisis"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"thank you for having me"
01:43:28;01:43:29;"good to have you back man"
01:43:29;01:43:30;"good to be back"
01:43:30;01:43:35;"so Tim just I want to get first the headline your new show Beef House"
01:43:35;01:43:39;"you pulled some strings to get it bumped up which I really appreciate"
01:43:39;01:43:42;"as a fan and a quarantined person"
01:43:42;01:43:46;"you got pulled some strings to get Adult Swim to bump up your you're an Eric's new show"
01:43:46;01:43:49;"to be streaming now when was it gonna stream originally"
01:43:49;01:43:54;"this Sunday so we put it out like a week ahead of time"
01:43:54;01:44:03;"which I feel like was not you know we tried to do it earlier like sort of that first week when stuff started going downhill"
01:44:03;01:44:09;"but now I feel like we all we did was give people a like a hit of heroin"
01:44:09;01:44:13;"and now they have to wait two weeks"
01:44:13;01:44:16;"we didn't put the whole thing out we just put one episode out"
01:44:16;01:44:19;"and now they know it's gonna be two weeks before the next one"
01:44:19;01:44:23;"you know so it's a bit of a lateral move but"
01:44:23;01:44:27;"well I appreciate it I've watched it a few times"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"did you enjoy it?"
01:44:28;01:44:31;"oh I loved it I watched it three times"
01:44:31;01:44:33;"well you know it's a short episode"
01:44:33;01:44:34;"yeah"
01:44:34;01:44:38;"one thing that I was thinking which is very strange I don't know if this crossed your mind if anybody said it to you"
01:44:38;01:44:42;"in the first episode of Beef House it opens with a"
01:44:42;01:44:47;"it takes place in a beef house and it opens with an Easter parade and the whole thing is about"
01:44:47;01:44:53;"how much you guys and especially Eric's character loves Easter and it's such an important holiday to him"
01:44:53;01:44:57;"and then so I watched it a few times and then a day or two later"
01:44:57;01:45:02;"Trump gets up there and is like we need to open America by Easter"
01:45:02;01:45:04;"Easter is a very important holiday to me and I was like"
01:45:04;01:45:11;"I know I can't believe like there's been a few of these things in my recent like work that keeps"
01:45:11;01:45:17;"like strangely coincidentally predicting the future or we do stuff"
01:45:17;01:45:24;"you know obviously we shot that in the fall and yeah there's no way you know"
01:45:24;01:45:29;"I mean I guess it makes sense that our idiot is gonna say something dumb like that but"
01:45:29;01:45:32;"but the idea of being really into Easter"
01:45:32;01:45:38;"it's already such a funny thing to be really into Easter because as far as like the famous Christian holidays go"
01:45:38;01:45:42;"I think 99% of people's favorite holiday is Christmas it just towers above"
01:45:42;01:45:47;"so the idea of just being like super hyped on Easter is already strange"
01:45:47;01:45:50;"as a lapsed Catholic as I am"
01:45:50;01:45:56;"Easter is actually the most the holiest of holidays for the Catholics"
01:45:56;01:45:59;"as far as the real like religious importance goes"
01:45:59;01:46:02;"the religious side of it the resurrection that's"
01:46:02;01:46:05;"the birth is not as big a deal"
01:46:05;01:46:08;"you have to have them both I guess for the whole thing to work but"
01:46:08;01:46:13;"for some reason as a kid like Easter was like the most important religious holiday"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"it's the conclusion it's the Avengers"
01:46:15;01:46:17;"it's the fulfillment of the prophecy big time"
01:46:17;01:46:21;"yeah when you put it that way maybe this is less of a Catholic thing"
01:46:21;01:46:28;"but the idea that this like kind of like epic like resolution of the story of the Son of God"
01:46:28;01:46:33;"coming back from the dead is somehow became the pastel holiday"
01:46:33;01:46:35;"is so bizarre"
01:46:35;01:46:41;"well it's spring I mean it's renewal it's all pagan you know it's all coming from pagan traditions"
01:46:41;01:46:44;"I mean the chocolates is garbage you know"
01:46:44;01:46:47;"if you ask my six-year-old what her favorite holidays are it's"
01:46:47;01:46:49;"Halloween because of candy"
01:46:49;01:46:53;"then Christmas because of presents and then Easter because of candy"
01:46:53;01:46:56;"there's no other real association besides candy"
01:46:56;01:47:01;"so as a father with young children who obviously are going to be very excited for Easter"
01:47:01;01:47:05;"is it difficult getting supplies do you have enough peeps and things like that"
01:47:05;01:47:11;"you know we're gonna have not we have much more pressing issues at the moment"
01:47:11;01:47:13;"we have not stocked up on Easter"
01:47:13;01:47:16;"although we did like sort of a we were cleaning out a closet"
01:47:16;01:47:19;"and we had all the Easter the plastic Easter eggs"
01:47:19;01:47:23;"so we did kind of a dry run of an Easter egg hunt in the house"
01:47:23;01:47:27;"which took up about 25 minutes of time"
01:47:27;01:47:30;"which was you know we're trying to just fill the hours here"
01:47:30;01:47:34;"I mean I don't know how much of this quarantine business you want to talk about"
01:47:34;01:47:36;"but it's all about filling the hours"
01:47:36;01:47:38;"well actually I do have this question like well how old are your kids"
01:47:38;01:47:42;"three and six but one is in first grade the other one is in preschool"
01:47:42;01:47:47;"that seems very hard core to have like like well you're the one who's in first grade"
01:47:47;01:47:50;"are they video conferencing their teachers and stuff"
01:47:50;01:47:53;"not yet that should start next week"
01:47:53;01:47:56;"this is so boring but we were on spring break"
01:47:57;01:47:59;"they were on spring break in Glendale"
01:47:59;01:48:01;"and they extended the spring break a week"
01:48:01;01:48:04;"so that they could figure out what the hell to do"
01:48:04;01:48:07;"but this morning I mean listen I love my kids"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"but I was like you know my wife is busy with her stuff"
01:48:10;01:48:14;"and I've got a lot of stuff to try to keep going keep balls in the air"
01:48:14;01:48:17;"I'm like I'll do the kids all morning I'll do them like all"
01:48:17;01:48:19;"you don't have to think about them"
01:48:19;01:48:23;"I'm just gonna be with the kids all day until like you know lunchtime"
01:48:23;01:48:27;"and it's hard man I was in a tent with them"
01:48:27;01:48:29;"we put a tent up in our front yard"
01:48:29;01:48:34;"and it's like you know you just kind of run out of stuff to do"
01:48:34;01:48:38;"and I was really exhausted I was and I'm just you know kind of depressed too"
01:48:38;01:48:42;"so I was just kind of like I don't know man what are we doing camping now"
01:48:42;01:48:44;"camping in our front yard"
01:48:44;01:48:46;"you're just like I'm not into this guys"
01:48:46;01:48:49;"I don't want to play I don't want to play this"
01:48:49;01:48:52;"there's all sorts of rules I had to listen to how grim it got"
01:48:52;01:48:55;"according to my daughter we had to get married"
01:48:55;01:48:58;"you know she said listen what if you were not my dad"
01:48:58;01:49:00;"but we were in love and we had to get married"
01:49:00;01:49:03;"and this whole scenario that she invents"
01:49:03;01:49:06;"and then I become the husband to her"
01:49:06;01:49:10;"it becomes a whole thing in her head that I've got to play along with"
01:49:10;01:49:13;"it's crossed my mind where I was thinking about people with kids your age"
01:49:13;01:49:16;"where I'm like to have a kid where you got to worry about school issues"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"or where the kid is asking you questions about like"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"wait so I really can't go see my friends"
01:49:22;01:49:25;"wait when's school gonna start that must be this whole other thing"
01:49:25;01:49:28;"my kids are so great and I had like"
01:49:28;01:49:33;"because I was a little like my attitude wasn't probably as chipper as it could be"
01:49:33;01:49:35;"so tonight when they're going to bed I was like"
01:49:35;01:49:38;"are you okay with not seeing your friends I know it's hard"
01:49:38;01:49:40;"and I tried to have like a little chat with them"
01:49:40;01:49:43;"but they were just like it's fine we're having a great time"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"like they're very chill"
01:49:45;01:49:47;"and they're like we could call my"
01:49:47;01:49:49;"I could call my friends if I want I'm fine"
01:49:49;01:49:52;"she wanted me to like not worry about it which was nice"
01:49:52;01:49:55;"but yeah they're so easy and good and sweet"
01:49:55;01:49:59;"and I'm not I'm very lucky and I hate complaining about it"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"especially to you guys"
01:50:01;01:50:02;"no that's good to hear"
01:50:02;01:50:05;"but you mentioned that you were feeling depressed"
01:50:05;01:50:08;"is it just because of the state of the world"
01:50:08;01:50:10;"today was tough I just"
01:50:10;01:50:13;"you know I don't know how you sleep do you sleep well"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"I've been sleeping okay"
01:50:15;01:50:18;"I started to worry about reading the news too close to bedtime"
01:50:18;01:50:20;"like I had one or two nights where I was like"
01:50:20;01:50:23;"something bouncing around in your head just some real dark article"
01:50:23;01:50:26;"sure I sleep pretty good in general"
01:50:26;01:50:29;"but last night I was up at like 4"
01:50:29;01:50:32;"and I couldn't go back to sleep so I kind of got up"
01:50:32;01:50:34;"and was like doing some work and"
01:50:34;01:50:37;"it was just one of those days where by the time everyone else got up"
01:50:37;01:50:40;"I had already kind of lived like a half a day you know"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"right"
01:50:41;01:50:43;"and if you want to get real boring"
01:50:43;01:50:47;"I've had terrible internet issues the past three days"
01:50:47;01:50:48;"at my house"
01:50:48;01:50:49;"oh god"
01:50:49;01:50:50;"and I'm trying to do this"
01:50:50;01:50:53;"that's deeply stressful in this moment"
01:50:53;01:50:56;"the third cable guy came over today"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"which was already stressful because I'm like"
01:50:58;01:51:00;"should you be coming to my house"
01:51:00;01:51:02;"the first thing he said to me was"
01:51:02;01:51:06;"they needed to bring a different kind of technician to the house"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"this is the third visit"
01:51:07;01:51:11;"and I nearly I swear to God I nearly started crying"
01:51:11;01:51:13;"I was like I got choked up I was like"
01:51:13;01:51:15;"I don't know what to do anymore"
01:51:15;01:51:16;"I'm sorry I need your help"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"I need you to help me"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"my job requires me to be on the internet"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"and you know I'm just trying to"
01:51:23;01:51:27;"like I'm trying to do my office hours podcast from my house"
01:51:27;01:51:28;"right yeah so one thing"
01:51:28;01:51:31;"I caught one of your live streams"
01:51:31;01:51:32;"the other day and"
01:51:32;01:51:35;"had some people send me messages about"
01:51:35;01:51:38;"certain Vampire Weekend songs or the last album"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"and hitting a little different in the context of this"
01:51:41;01:51:44;"there's definitely a few songs on the last record that reference"
01:51:44;01:51:46;"staying inside not going outside"
01:51:46;01:51:49;"and people referencing Harmony Hall a bunch"
01:51:49;01:51:52;"but I can't think of a song that seems more"
01:51:52;01:51:53;"on the nose to reference this"
01:51:53;01:51:55;"than your song which you were performing"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"Work From Home"
01:51:56;01:51:57;"yeah"
01:51:57;01:51:58;"the crazy thing about it is"
01:51:58;01:52:01;"other people have some songs about working from home"
01:52:01;01:52:02;"but there's something about"
01:52:02;01:52:03;"the fact that you just say"
01:52:03;01:52:05;"I'm gonna stay in bed stare at the ceiling"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"and wait for the sickness"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"to just go away"
01:52:09;01:52:10;"there's something about like"
01:52:10;01:52:11;"when I caught you on the live stream"
01:52:11;01:52:12;"I'm not for domicile"
01:52:12;01:52:13;"I was like oh yeah Work From Home"
01:52:13;01:52:14;"I remember this song"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"this is a good Tim song"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"and then when you hit the part about"
01:52:17;01:52:18;"and wait for the sickness"
01:52:18;01:52:19;"I was like"
01:52:19;01:52:22;"did he change the lyric for like the Corona times"
01:52:22;01:52:24;"or was it always wait for the sickness"
01:52:24;01:52:26;"it was all like you know hungover"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"that kind of sickness"
01:52:27;01:52:28;"that's what I was writing about"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"but I got a Google alert from Billboard"
01:52:31;01:52:33;"you know listen I don't chart like you"
01:52:33;01:52:34;"I don't make"
01:52:34;01:52:37;"I'm not a big famous rock star"
01:52:37;01:52:39;"with number one records and Grammys"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"but I got like a Google alert"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"that Billboard was like"
01:52:43;01:52:47;"this song jumped 60% in the streams category"
01:52:47;01:52:48;"oh really"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"I'm thinking"
01:52:49;01:52:52;"it went from like 25 plays to 35 plays"
01:52:52;01:52:53;"or something"
01:52:53;01:52:54;"you know how in England"
01:52:54;01:52:55;"it was exciting"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"in England they always get obsessed"
01:52:56;01:52:58;"at Christmas with what's gonna be number one"
01:52:58;01:53:00;"and there's like you know"
01:53:00;01:53:02;"there's Love Actually"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"that's the whole plot point"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"and people are always like"
01:53:04;01:53:05;"there's campaigns"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"like let's make this number one"
01:53:07;01:53:09;"I think for the TC community"
01:53:09;01:53:10;"let's make a campaign"
01:53:10;01:53:11;"to get Tim Heidecker"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"Work From Home"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"to be a Corona number one"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"number one on the Billboard charts"
01:53:16;01:53:18;"during the Corona era"
01:53:18;01:53:20;"I mean you always hear about these stories"
01:53:20;01:53:21;"don't you in rock history"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"about like"
01:53:22;01:53:23;"it was a nothing record"
01:53:23;01:53:24;"it disappeared"
01:53:24;01:53:26;"and then some DJ played it"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"and it blew up overnight"
01:53:28;01:53:29;"I never really understood"
01:53:29;01:53:30;"how that works"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"but maybe this will happen"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"I'm low"
01:53:35;01:53:38;"low to the ground"
01:53:38;01:53:44;"I don't think I'm getting out of bed today"
01:53:44;01:53:48;"How one of those nights"
01:53:48;01:53:51;"one in a million"
01:53:51;01:53:56;"one too many drinks I guess you'd say"
01:53:56;01:54:01;"so I'm gonna work from home"
01:54:02;01:54:04;"call if you need me"
01:54:04;01:54:10;"I don't think I'd be much use anyway"
01:54:10;01:54:14;"yeah I'm gonna stay in bed"
01:54:14;01:54:17;"stare at the ceiling"
01:54:17;01:54:20;"wait for the sickness"
01:54:20;01:54:22;"to just go away"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Have you cancelled stuff"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"or were you naturally"
01:54:25;01:54:26;"kind of winding down"
01:54:26;01:54:27;"for a little bit?"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"We have a decent amount of stuff"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"booked this year"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"a lot of it's kind of touch and go"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"I mean it was funny"
01:54:32;01:54:37;"I got an alert from my airline app today"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"that was saying like"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"get ready for your flight"
01:54:39;01:54:40;"to Buenos Aires"
01:54:40;01:54:41;"and I was like"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"oh yeah that's not happening"
01:54:43;01:54:46;"yeah La La Palooza South America"
01:54:46;01:54:47;"that was our next big thing"
01:54:47;01:54:49;"which was starting this weekend"
01:54:49;01:54:51;"and they pulled the plug on that"
01:54:51;01:54:52;"a couple weeks ago"
01:54:52;01:54:53;"and they rescheduled"
01:54:53;01:54:54;"for later in the year"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"Our person was"
01:54:55;01:54:56;"first of all"
01:54:56;01:54:57;"we were doing Australia"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"like a couple days after you guys"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Oh right yeah"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"you got there right when we left"
01:55:02;01:55:04;"yeah this is a crazy time"
01:55:04;01:55:05;"that we're touring Australia"
01:55:05;01:55:06;"during the fires"
01:55:06;01:55:08;"yeah we're like wondering"
01:55:08;01:55:10;"if those are gonna get cancelled"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"and then we come back"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"and do our Tim and Eric"
01:55:13;01:55:14;"tour of the states"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"and we ended on the Saturday"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"before like the Monday"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"where things started"
01:55:21;01:55:22;"getting really cancelled"
01:55:22;01:55:24;"like the plan was"
01:55:24;01:55:25;"first of all"
01:55:25;01:55:26;"if anyone that's listening"
01:55:26;01:55:27;"saw our show"
01:55:27;01:55:28;"they know that"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"the last bit in our show"
01:55:30;01:55:32;"20 minute long"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"kind of extended sketch"
01:55:34;01:55:35;"that sort of becomes"
01:55:35;01:55:36;"the finale of the show"
01:55:36;01:55:39;"is literally a sketch"
01:55:39;01:55:40;"about a disease"
01:55:40;01:55:41;"that becomes airborne"
01:55:41;01:55:42;"in the theater"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"that we have to close"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"the exits"
01:55:45;01:55:47;"and literally we say the words"
01:55:47;01:55:49;"like we have to quarantine"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"we cannot let anyone leave"
01:55:50;01:55:51;"we've all been exposed"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"to the disease"
01:55:52;01:55:53;"I swear to God"
01:55:53;01:55:55;"and we wrote this show last year"
01:55:55;01:55:56;"so it wasn't anything"
01:55:56;01:55:57;"connected to this"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"and it really wasn't"
01:55:59;01:56:00;"people weren't really"
01:56:00;01:56:01;"talking about it"
01:56:01;01:56:02;"until like the last"
01:56:02;01:56:03;"two weeks of the tour"
01:56:03;01:56:05;"and then it became like"
01:56:05;01:56:07;"the second week of the tour"
01:56:07;01:56:08;"people were like"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"oh man I heard about this"
01:56:09;01:56:11;"like that's pretty smart"
01:56:11;01:56:13;"and then the last few shows"
01:56:13;01:56:14;"where people were"
01:56:14;01:56:15;"kind of squirming"
01:56:15;01:56:16;"because they were just like"
01:56:16;01:56:18;"what is this"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"how are you even"
01:56:19;01:56:20;"talking about this"
01:56:20;01:56:22;"and then we got done"
01:56:22;01:56:23;"with the last show"
01:56:23;01:56:24;"and you could tell"
01:56:24;01:56:25;"it was like"
01:56:25;01:56:26;"we got out of this"
01:56:26;01:56:27;"in the nick of time"
01:56:27;01:56:28;"Eric and I were supposed"
01:56:28;01:56:29;"to go to New York"
01:56:29;01:56:30;"the next week"
01:56:30;01:56:31;"to do Jimmy Fallon"
01:56:31;01:56:33;"and Stephen Colbert"
01:56:33;01:56:34;"for Beef House"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"and by the third day"
01:56:36;01:56:37;"we were home"
01:56:37;01:56:38;"Eric was like"
01:56:38;01:56:40;"I don't think we should go"
01:56:40;01:56:41;"I was like really"
01:56:41;01:56:42;"like he wrote me"
01:56:42;01:56:43;"he was like"
01:56:43;01:56:44;"do you think we should go"
01:56:44;01:56:45;"I'm like listen"
01:56:45;01:56:46;"it's going to have to get bad"
01:56:46;01:56:47;"for us not to go"
01:56:47;01:56:48;"like a day after"
01:56:48;01:56:49;"that conversation"
01:56:49;01:56:50;"was like how could we"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"even imagine going"
01:56:51;01:56:52;"I know"
01:56:52;01:56:53;"it was so quick"
01:56:53;01:56:54;"and crazy"
01:56:54;01:56:55;"and scary"
01:56:55;01:56:56;"it was really like"
01:56:56;01:56:57;"waiting for the dam"
01:56:57;01:56:58;"to burst"
01:56:58;01:56:59;"because even the week"
01:56:59;01:57:00;"when we were going"
01:57:00;01:57:01;"to this festival"
01:57:01;01:57:02;"in Florida"
01:57:02;01:57:03;"Okeechobee"
01:57:03;01:57:04;"a few days before we left"
01:57:04;01:57:05;"we're hearing that"
01:57:05;01:57:06;"a festival in Miami"
01:57:06;01:57:07;"had been cancelled"
01:57:07;01:57:08;"and we're like"
01:57:08;01:57:09;"why did they cancel that one"
01:57:09;01:57:10;"and not this one"
01:57:10;01:57:11;"and then we're from"
01:57:11;01:57:12;"the company being like"
01:57:12;01:57:13;"well the other one"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"that's an EDM festival"
01:57:14;01:57:15;"it's more international crowd"
01:57:15;01:57:16;"and I was kind of like"
01:57:16;01:57:17;"that's the kind of thing"
01:57:17;01:57:18;"you get the call"
01:57:18;01:57:19;"and you're like"
01:57:19;01:57:20;"well yeah that makes sense"
01:57:20;01:57:21;"and then you stop"
01:57:21;01:57:22;"and you think about it"
01:57:22;01:57:23;"and you're just like"
01:57:23;01:57:24;"some people coming"
01:57:24;01:57:25;"from all over the country"
01:57:25;01:57:26;"like does that really"
01:57:26;01:57:27;"make sense"
01:57:27;01:57:28;"there's all these"
01:57:28;01:57:29;"judgement calls being made"
01:57:29;01:57:30;"like by people that"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"maybe aren't that informed"
01:57:31;01:57:32;"yeah very strange times"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"the final time you did"
01:57:33;01:57:34;"the virus bit"
01:57:34;01:57:35;"must have been weird energy"
01:57:35;01:57:36;"I mean it still wasn't"
01:57:36;01:57:37;"even that bad"
01:57:37;01:57:38;"but I did want"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"like I think it was"
01:57:39;01:57:40;"in San Francisco"
01:57:40;01:57:41;"or Portland"
01:57:41;01:57:42;"it was like Portland"
01:57:42;01:57:43;"and it was like"
01:57:43;01:57:44;"that last week"
01:57:44;01:57:45;"before it would not have been"
01:57:45;01:57:46;"like we ended when"
01:57:46;01:57:47;"it was still funny"
01:57:47;01:57:48;"but it was like"
01:57:48;01:57:49;"it was like"
01:57:53;01:57:54;"and it was still funny"
01:57:54;01:57:55;"but if it would have gone"
01:57:55;01:57:56;"another maybe four days"
01:57:56;01:57:57;"it would have been not funny"
01:57:57;01:57:58;"it would have been like"
01:57:58;01:57:59;"we have to re-write this"
01:57:59;01:58:00;"because it sucks"
01:58:00;01:58:01;"it's too uncomfortable"
01:58:02;01:58:03;"but I made one crack"
01:58:03;01:58:04;"where like"
01:58:04;01:58:05;"there was a joke about"
01:58:05;01:58:07;"the CDC is aware"
01:58:07;01:58:08;"of the situation"
01:58:08;01:58:09;"and they're coming"
01:58:09;01:58:10;"they're going to save us"
01:58:10;01:58:11;"and I usually would say"
01:58:11;01:58:12;"but we're a low priority"
01:58:12;01:58:13;"because of the kind of comedy"
01:58:13;01:58:14;"we do"
01:58:14;01:58:15;"and the kind of people you are"
01:58:15;01:58:16;"I was like"
01:58:16;01:58:17;"the joke I would say"
01:58:17;01:58:18;"but once it got out"
01:58:18;01:58:19;"and it was like"
01:58:19;01:58:20;"I was like"
01:58:20;01:58:21;"the joke I would say"
01:58:21;01:58:22;"but one night I just said"
01:58:22;01:58:23;"the CDC is coming"
01:58:23;01:58:24;"but we're a low priority"
01:58:24;01:58:25;"because they're dealing"
01:58:25;01:58:26;"with something else right now"
01:58:26;01:58:27;"I don't really know what it is"
01:58:27;01:58:28;"and you could feel the room"
01:58:28;01:58:29;"being like"
01:58:29;01:58:30;"eww"
01:58:30;01:58:31;"right"
01:58:31;01:58:32;"too real"
01:58:32;01:58:33;"I don't like this"
01:58:33;01:58:34;"yeah"
01:58:34;01:58:35;"I don't like this"
01:58:35;01:58:36;"so"
01:58:36;01:58:37;"good lord"
01:58:37;01:58:38;"I mean"
01:58:38;01:58:39;"anyways"
01:58:39;01:58:40;"one last question"
01:58:40;01:58:41;"yeah"
