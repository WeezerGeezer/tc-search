00:00;00:04;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:04;00:06;"Well, here we are."
00:06;00:10;"So much to discuss in the dog days of summer."
00:10;00:19;"Jake and I reunite to discuss literature, music, and of course, technology."
00:19;00:23;"All this, plus Brian Jones and his new instant cover album."
00:23;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:34;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:40;00:47;"They were a value of me, all my rightful chances"
00:47;00:54;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:54;01:01;"And so I dealt to the blow, when a bus had to go"
01:01;01:06;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:06;01:12;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:12;01:16;"Even only me"
01:16;01:18;"Time Crisis, back again."
01:18;01:22;"Jake, how the hell are you?"
01:22;01:24;"Pretty good. It's hot as f*** out here."
01:24;01:26;"Are you in an air-conditioned environment?"
01:26;01:30;"I am currently, but I was just in the backyard for the last three hours"
01:30;01:36;"doing a socially distanced acoustic guitar hangout with a friend of the show, Aaron."
01:36;01:38;"Oh, tight."
01:38;01:44;"But it's like 95 out, and the sun kept creeping at different angles, so we kept having to move."
01:44;01:46;"In LA, it's all about shade, you know?"
01:46;01:47;"Yep."
01:47;01:49;"I mean, there have been some articles written about it."
01:49;01:56;"It's like one of the harshest deprivations for the have-nots in LA is to not have shade."
01:56;02:01;"Because they planted all these non-native palm trees all over."
02:01;02:06;"But you know, even if you've got to build something, even if you've got to do a Home Depot run,"
02:06;02:13;"build your own pergola, and lay out various sticks, or I don't know, whatever it takes,"
02:13;02:15;"I'm all about the shade."
02:15;02:20;"I've always felt that way, like, on a hot day, anywhere, not just LA, but LA's a hot place,"
02:20;02:23;"you can go from hell to heaven in a second."
02:23;02:28;"You round a corner, and suddenly the sun's out of your eyes, and you enjoy a nice freeze,"
02:28;02:30;"and the temperature drops, you know?"
02:30;02:31;"You're preaching to the choir here, bud."
02:31;02:33;"Well, what happened to all these trees you planted?"
02:33;02:35;"What happened to trees?"
02:35;02:36;"You're listening to Tree Talk."
02:36;02:40;"We got Jake Longstreet, Los Angeles, California, on the phone."
02:40;02:43;"This guy planted some trees about two months ago."
02:43;02:44;"How are they holding up?"
02:44;02:50;"They're doing great, yeah, but believe it or not, they're not 40-foot tall shade trees quite yet."
02:50;02:54;"Didn't we talk about-- I feel like maybe it was off-air we talked about that expression of,"
02:54;03:00;"like, you plant trees now for, like, future generations' shade or something?"
03:00;03:05;"Oh, yeah. No, we talked about that when we did a socially distanced hang at my house."
03:05;03:06;"Right."
03:06;03:12;"We were talking conceptually about things that span generations, and how, yeah,"
03:12;03:18;"is there a specific phrase, but basically that you plant a tree not so that you can enjoy the shade,"
03:18;03:22;"but so that future generations can because a really big tree,"
03:22;03:26;"you're not going to get to see it reach its full height in your lifetime."
03:26;03:29;"I think I found the quote that that originates from."
03:29;03:35;"""A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit."""
03:35;03:36;"Yeah."
03:36;03:38;"Ah. Is it attributed to somebody?"
03:38;03:42;"It's just a Greek proverb. No attribution."
03:42;03:43;"Let me get that one more time."
03:43;03:46;"Let's hear that s*** back."
03:47;03:54;"""A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit."""
03:54;03:55;"It's really a beautiful sentiment."
03:55;03:57;"A little wordy, but, yeah."
03:57;03:59;"Sitting in the backyard trying to avoid the sun."
03:59;04:05;"Were you guys just jamming, or were you, like, working on some mountain brews or Richard Pictures?"
04:05;04:08;"We were brewing. We were working on, uh..."
04:08;04:12;"[laughing]"
04:12;04:14;"We were brewing. I love that."
04:14;04:17;"Like, we've been writing songs together kind of high school style."
04:17;04:18;"Mm-hmm."
04:18;04:20;"Just like, ""Dude, you got a chorus for that?"""
04:20;04:24;"Have other people ever significantly contributed lyrics to a mountain brews song?"
04:24;04:26;"Because it is just such a specific voice."
04:26;04:28;"Kyle Field has a little bit."
04:28;04:29;"Oh, yeah. I could see that."
04:29;04:33;"But not really. So this one, yeah, like, Aaron's coming up with song titles."
04:33;04:34;"Chords."
04:34;04:36;"Yeah. Definitely chords and stuff. Yeah."
04:36;04:37;"Yeah."
04:37;04:39;"Flushing it out. Fleshing it out?"
04:39;04:40;"Uh-huh."
04:40;04:41;"Yeah, fleshing it out."
04:41;04:42;"Wait, actually..."
04:42;04:43;"Fleshing."
04:43;04:44;"Not fleshing."
04:44;04:50;"Yeah, you flush something out, like, when you get chemicals in your eye in a laboratory."
04:50;04:55;"I feel like in chemistry class, there's always, like, a station that said something about flushing your eyes out."
04:55;04:56;"Yeah."
04:56;04:57;"Which is the only place I ever heard that."
04:57;04:59;"And I guess you could..."
04:59;05:02;"You don't flush out a toilet. You just flush it."
05:02;05:10;"But you flesh out an idea because it's meaning, like, you got the bones and now you're throwing some flesh onto it."
05:10;05:14;"Whoa. Kind of gory a little bit. I don't like that."
05:14;05:21;"It's like some weird futuristic movie where there's, like, a 3D bioprinter and it's like, ""Here's the skeleton."""
05:21;05:25;"Wait, Seinfeld, let me get a linguistic crunch. What's the deal with fleshing out?"
05:25;05:35;"Fleshing out also sounds like it could be in, like, some cyberpunk future when people never see each other IRL anymore and live, like, logged in."
05:35;05:41;"That fleshing out could be, like, once a decade hanging in real life."
05:41;05:43;"Bro, we're fleshing out."
05:43;05:46;"I unplugged my neural transmitter and we fleshed out."
05:46;05:50;"Just got in the backyard, just, like, IRL humans. It was so f***ing weird."
05:50;05:52;"I'm on vocabulary.com."
05:52;05:53;"Great website."
05:53;05:56;"Love it. Love it. It's bookmarked."
05:56;06:03;"And it says, ""Flesh out is believed to come from the idea of adding flesh, physical substance, to a skeleton or a frame."""
06:03;06:04;"You nailed it."
06:04;06:09;"Whoa. That just seems so futuristic."
06:09;06:15;"It really seems like Westworld or, like, you know, in the Fifth Element, do they, like, 3D print a body?"
06:15;06:16;"Yeah."
06:16;06:21;"I guess they're imagining, like, the Lord God adding flesh to a skeleton."
06:21;06:25;"Like, there's no time in life where a human adds flesh to a skeleton."
06:25;06:33;"I'm looking into 3D printing, like, body parts in movies and apparently there's, like, this can actually be done in real life."
06:33;06:34;"What?"
06:34;06:41;"I have an article here on BBC that's, like, the headline is ""The Firm That Can 3D Print Human Body Parts."""
06:41;06:42;"Gross."
06:42;06:44;"This is the future, man."
06:44;06:46;"I start to feel old when I hear stuff like that."
06:46;06:56;"When you just hear about a bunch of kids having flesh out parties where they order just ears and arms and eyeballs off of, uh, what's the company called?"
06:56;06:58;"Cellink. It's a Swedish company."
06:58;07:13;"There's a disturbing new trend on TikTok called ""fleshing out"" where Zoomers buy a series of 3D printed body parts off Cellink and use them for gross TikTok pranks."
07:13;07:21;"This hilarious kid put an actual human—a 3D printed human ear in his dad's iced tea every day for 365 days."
07:21;07:23;"Here's a supercut of it."
07:23;07:28;"Jesus Christ, Brendan! Not again!"
07:28;07:45;"Yeah, I mean, this is the kind of sh*t that's, like—I think this is gonna increasingly happen as we kind of continue to live in this, like, weird nothing happens, everything happens kind of, like, frozen world's falling apart, but also it's so slow and boring."
07:45;07:55;"It's a slow apocalypse that we're kind of, like, living in. I just had, like, a weird feeling for a second where, you know, we've been hearing about the genetic engineering our whole lives."
07:55;08:00;"Like, I feel like I was a kid when they, uh, cloned Dolly the sheep."
08:00;08:08;"And I even feel like in my biology textbook in high school, there was, like, a picture of a human ear growing off a rat's back."
08:08;08:20;"I guess it's basically, like, it's hard to keep up with what's going on, so I could almost believe, like, I had, like, a slight Rip Van Winkle feeling where I'm like, ""Yeah, that—it makes sense that they'd be able to just 3D print body parts now."""
08:20;08:26;"And yet that seems like such a game-changing thing that I feel like I would have heard, like, you wouldn't need organ donors anymore."
08:26;08:31;"That you wouldn't hear this stuff, like, where somebody on Twitter is like, you know, ""Oh, my cousin's dying from a rare disease."""
08:31;08:39;"""For the love of God, if you're from this ethnic background, could you check your blood type or your bone ma—"" You know, you still see stuff like that."
08:39;08:45;"I would imagine if they can 3D print stuff and, like, they've mapped the human genome, I thought maybe they could do some of this stuff."
08:45;08:55;"But anyway, I guess when I'm talking about this, like, slow apocalypse feeling, I could kind of picture, like, us hanging out or perhaps even doing TC in, like, 20 years."
08:55;08:58;"And just like, ""Wait, can they clone people?"""
08:58;09:01;"Dude, remember Sam? No, Sam's a clone."
09:01;09:02;"Do you remember? Like, six years ago, dude."
09:02;09:06;"Oh, right. No, it's funny, man. You know, time feels so weird these days."
09:06;09:11;"No, no, I knew that. I guess I knew that intellectually, but, like, I could just picture, like, all these—"
09:11;09:18;"As, like, the world falls apart, but also science reaches this, like, weird fever pitch of just, like, new bullsh*t."
09:18;09:27;"I could just imagine sh*t like that happening, like, where, you know, already think about how bewildering life was for, like, our grandparents' generation who watched the whole world change."
09:27;09:33;"And for us, it's just going to be even weirder and just be like, ""Maybe we won't even make it to this sh*t."" I just think more of that sh*t can happen."
09:33;09:39;"You're so right, too, about it not really sinking in. Like, for some reason, the way information is now, like, it's all just a wash."
09:39;09:49;"So, like, you'd be like, ""Dude, yeah, there was, like, a really controversial bill in Congress for them, like, to, like, allow UPS and DHL and FedEx to employ clone."""
09:49;09:55;"Remember? It narrowly passed, and, ""Oh, yeah, dude."""
09:55;09:58;"It feels very Amazon Prime to me."
09:58;10:06;"Yeah, Bezos implanted his 70-year-old mind into a 25-year-old body and is still running the company."
10:06;10:08;"Very, like, Lex Luthor or something."
10:08;10:09;"Oh, full-on."
10:09;10:15;"Are there clones walking among us? Are there? Yes? Seinfeld's not as—"
10:15;10:18;"I don't think there's human clones walking among us, but who the hell knows, man?"
10:18;10:23;"You know, and we're both reading the Tom O'Neill book."
10:23;10:25;"Oh, yeah, I finished it last night."
10:25;10:28;"You finished it? Well, I gotta catch up."
10:28;10:34;"So, actually, I wanted to talk about this on the show because we kind of inadvertently did a TC book club."
10:34;10:40;"We've been talking on the chain about various books we're gonna read and got a little bit out of order, but Jake—"
10:40;10:48;"We were just talking a while ago, and Jake told me that he was reading this book, Chaos, which is by Tom O'Neill, which is about the Manson murders."
10:48;10:56;"He's a dude who started writing a magazine article for the 30th anniversary of the Manson murders around 1999."
10:56;11:03;"And next thing you know, his three-month magazine assignment turned into a 20-year obsession."
11:03;11:12;"And he wrote one of, like, probably, like, the deepest book ever about Manson, challenging and definitely disproving elements of the official narrative,"
11:12;11:21;"finding crazy connections between the CIA, all sorts of weird inconsistencies, the FBI, various secret programs."
11:21;11:25;"It's truly a wild book. He's a great writer."
11:25;11:33;"And, yeah, so anyway, I feel like it was, like, about a week and a half ago, Jake, you texted me just like, ""Dude, did you crack that book yet? I can't put it down."""
11:33;11:38;"And I actually hadn't yet, but then I got really excited. I wanted to finish this other book that I was reading."
11:38;11:42;"And then once I got in, I was off to the races. Couldn't put it down."
11:42;11:48;"All of the CIA stuff with, like, them running those, like, safe houses in the cities where they were dosing people."
11:48;11:49;"Right."
11:49;11:57;"And all of that, like, was Jack Ruby, a Manchurian candidate. There's so much crazy stuff in that book that I'm just like, yeah, maybe there are."
11:57;12:03;"I mean, and that was, this is stuff he's, like, writing about 50 years after the fact. Maybe there are clones walking among us right now."
12:03;12:09;"This is not a spoiler because this is, I'm sure a lot of our listeners have heard of this in other scenarios."
12:09;12:18;"Maybe they don't know how it may or may not relate to Charles Manson, but there's a very famous CIA operation starting, I believe, in the '50s called MK-ULTRA."
12:18;12:28;"And that was essentially about using acid, hypnosis, and I'm sure other techniques to try to, various forms of mind control."
12:28;12:35;"Whether it's making people have false memories, changing their memories, make them do things that they didn't remember."
12:35;12:37;"As Jake said, the Manchurian candidate stuff."
12:37;12:44;"So, again, definitely recommend the book and we should definitely try to get Tom O'Neill on the show, but that was a real program."
12:44;12:45;"Right."
12:45;12:48;"Obviously, the American public never got all the details. It's the CIA."
12:48;12:55;"And the CIA also took great pains to be, to kind of say, like, yeah, man, you know, we were trying that MK-ULTRA shit for a while."
12:55;13:00;"Here's the thing. Really didn't work at all. Egg on our face."
13:00;13:01;"Right."
13:01;13:05;"You know, we had a few wacky scientists among our ranks. We were just a bunch of weirdos, man."
13:05;13:08;"We were trying all sorts of crazy shit. Yeah, no, it didn't work at all."
13:08;13:15;"Which is like, could be true, or it's exactly what you would say if you did kind of crack the code on it."
13:15;13:17;"Picture that, it's Cold War."
13:17;13:24;"The idea that potentially the Soviet Union might have a leg up on the US in terms of mind control."
13:24;13:29;"Picture like a hardcore, like, American Cold Warrior, lived through World War II and all this shit."
13:29;13:37;"Somebody be like, our national security depends on us f***ing like dosing random Air Force dudes with acid and figuring out how to do this s***."
13:37;13:39;"Like, whatever it takes."
13:39;13:43;"I'm sure there's all sorts of stuff that we don't know about. There's two schools of thought."
13:43;13:50;"One is that that was a unique time. The post-war Cold War era was a unique time in the history of this country."
13:50;13:56;"And you had this weird power vacuum in the world. People terrified of communism."
13:56;14:02;"People desperately trying to assert American power, you know, using the momentum after World War II."
14:02;14:05;"And believing that they had to do whatever it took."
14:05;14:09;"And then eventually in the 70s, a lot of this stuff got found out in their congressional hearings."
14:09;14:15;"And that was that. Some of the, you know, the bad old school people were dead or lost their jobs."
14:15;14:19;"And you can believe that that was a uniquely psycho era of American history."
14:19;14:25;"It's possible. I don't know. Maybe that was a crazy era that made people were doing wild s***."
14:25;14:29;"And that since then, other bad s*** happened. It's just not the same."
14:29;14:33;"Or that could have been the start of something even more sophisticated."
14:33;14:35;"And there are clones walking among us."
15:00;15:07;"Reading the book, it occurred to me I hadn't really read that many books written as a first-person account of a journalist."
15:07;15:12;"And I loved how it was so kind of informal."
15:12;15:17;"And like in terms of his own first-person account of like, ""Well, I took this person to lunch."
15:17;15:23;"I tracked down this person that was the neighbor of the guy that owned the house in CLO Drive."
15:23;15:26;"And they were living out in Palm Springs. And I took them out to lunch."
15:26;15:31;"And then they told me, 'If I tell you what I want to tell you, they're going to kill you.'"""
15:31;15:36;"Like, it wasn't this like objective floating eyeball telling us what things happened."
15:36;15:45;"It was like his experience subjectively and like how his life changed over the course of the 20 years writing this book."
15:45;15:49;"Which makes it so much more readable because you're there with him."
15:49;15:53;"And you don't feel like you're just being presented with information."
15:53;15:56;"You're really going on this journey with him where he's like, ""Yeah."""
15:56;15:59;"And he always says where he took them out to eat. A lot of Denny's."
15:59;16:00;"Oh, yeah."
16:00;16:08;"I know you love that, Jake. Just like, ""Yeah. So then I f***ing drove 300 miles to Northern California and took this dude out to Denny's."""
16:08;16:15;"It's like the most stressful. Like he had so many stressful phone calls where he's like calling people knowing that they don't want to hear from them."
16:15;16:20;"And like knocking on doors, expecting people to like spit in his face, basically."
16:20;16:23;"And just the fact that he stuck with it for 20 years."
16:23;16:27;"And even then, he's not the type of dude to be like, ""And I cracked the case."""
16:27;16:32;"He's just saying like, ""I diligently worked on this and I found many inconsistencies in the main story."""
16:32;16:35;"You could draw certain conclusions from it. I'm not saying that those are correct."
16:35;16:38;"He's like too serious to ever be like, ""I proved it, man."""
16:38;16:43;"But he draws some really shocking connections, perhaps not conclusions."
16:43;16:51;"And one thing about it that's, I guess, comforting to kind of feel like you're watching somebody competently research."
16:51;17:01;"That's a comforting feeling. The kind of unnerving feeling of it is that it reminds you that serious research to actually get at the truth, right?"
17:01;17:07;"Which is kind of like the subject of our time, certainly the last four years, is what is truth."
17:07;17:15;"And so many people feel like we're slipping into this kind of like, as Adam Curtis would say, this like hyper normalized existence."
17:15;17:18;"But basically, it's the story of our time. What can you trust, right?"
17:18;17:22;"The internet drives us crazy. Our president drives us crazy."
17:22;17:26;"Even the Democrats drive us crazy sometimes. So it's like, it's truly infuriating."
17:26;17:30;"And then you read a book like this, which is maybe why it's hitting so hard right now,"
17:30;17:36;"is that it makes you realize that sometimes to really, even when you're looking at 20th century stuff,"
17:36;17:42;"where the modes weren't sophisticated, people sent each other memos on paper, people made phone calls."
17:42;17:46;"There were computers, but there wasn't the internet being used by everybody."
17:46;17:52;"It makes you realize just like sometimes to get to the truth takes like an eternity."
17:52;17:59;"It's like an eternity of a lifetime of like digging in and also staying calm."
17:59;18:03;"And not always like jumping to conclusions and checking and double checking."
18:03;18:11;"And yeah, flying to Idaho and going to Danny's and then going back to your little research office"
18:11;18:18;"and listening to that tape over and over again to see if you can come up with, you know, find an inconsistency or something."
18:18;18:25;"And then, you know, writing Freedom of Information Act requests over and over again and making phone calls."
18:25;18:33;"Anyway, it's all like in a world where a tweet could literally like change the course of history in a millisecond."
18:33;18:37;"There's something about this that's just like, it's almost like Zen-like."
18:37;18:40;"And I bet he wouldn't, clearly it was very stressful for him."
18:40;18:43;"It was no cakewalk. The dude's like running out of money throughout the book."
18:43;18:44;"Oh my God."
18:44;18:46;"Wondering if he's fully insane for doing this."
18:46;18:53;"So he might find it funny to describe it as Zen-like, but it's like craft, you know, it's like dedication and craft."
18:53;19:00;"There's so many times where he probably had just enough information that he could have like churned out like a sensationalist airport book."
19:00;19:04;"That's like the Madsen murders redux, what you didn't learn in Helter Skelter."
19:04;19:05;"Right."
19:05;19:11;"And think about how much financial pressure there was on him or anybody just to be like, dude, this was supposed to take three months."
19:11;19:16;"You psycho, you can't take 20 years to write this book. But it's a very fascinating book."
19:16;19:18;"Highly recommend for the TC book club."
19:18;19:24;"This is the TC book club and we'll try to get him on the show. And whether or not we do, we recommend it."
19:24;19:29;"So if you guys read it over the next couple of weeks or months, we can talk about it again."
19:29;19:32;"I'd love to try to crack a case with you, Jake."
19:32;19:34;"Ooh, detective."
19:34;19:42;"I don't think I could do Tom O'Neill style solo. Although on the cover of the book, it says he has a co-writer, their name's a little smaller, named Daniel Peipenberg."
19:42;19:45;"That must be one of his research assistants or something."
19:45;19:51;"You know what it was? Tom O'Neill was on Rogan last or this year and I had re-listened to the episode when I was driving up to my parents' house."
19:51;19:55;"The publishers brought in this younger guy, Dan, to help him write it."
19:55;20:04;"Like he had so much information that needed to be narrowed down and kind of put into a coherent sort of streamlined book."
20:04;20:12;"Okay, that guy's more of an assistant, but I don't know what kind of thing we could research or if either one of us really has the kind of investigative skills."
20:12;20:18;"Yeah, I'm not sure we have the gumption. I mean, I'm bad with like conflict with people."
20:18;20:32;"I'm very like conflict-averse. To write something like this or to research something, you need to be like very willing to like piss people off and have really unpleasant phone calls constantly."
20:32;20:35;"And that's tough. That's not my style."
20:35;20:37;"Yeah, that's going to be hard on the nervous system."
20:37;20:38;"Yeah."
20:38;20:46;"I especially picture that. It's like, you know, whatever we're getting into, it's like we feel like we finally got somebody on the phone after months of chasing them down."
20:46;20:56;"We got all our notes there. They're on speaker. And then like it's ringing. And we're just like, if this dude hangs up on us, we're screwed."
20:56;20:57;"We're at a dead end."
20:57;21:04;"Well, listen, sir, with all due respect, you know, me, I don't know what it's like, we're calling like Steve Miller or some s***."
21:04;21:13;"With all due respect, Mr. Miller, Jake and I have here in our hands a document obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, which does prove just like get the f*** out of here, man."
21:13;21:14;"No, I'm done with you guys."
21:14;21:16;"No, okay. Well, sir, sir, click."
21:16;21:17;"Yeah."
21:17;21:31;"Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River."
21:31;21:42;"Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze."
21:42;21:54;"Country roads, take me home to the place I belong."
21:54;22:05;"West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads."
22:05;22:15;"Hey, I also don't want to air any like TC Dirty Laundry, but speaking of the book club, I do feel like I have to say we had all made a decision on the thread that we were going to read another book."
22:15;22:26;"And so Seinfeld and I started the book. And then 24 hours later, you said, well, actually, Jake and I started reading this book. We don't have to get into it now."
22:26;22:31;"I wasn't going to mention it. I wasn't going to bring it up, but it did cross my mind."
22:31;22:38;"No, I like this. This is a good arc for the show is TC Book Club Civil War."
22:38;22:49;"That also seems like a movie that could be marketed towards like retiring boomers, almost like an exotic Marigold Hotel type thing that's called Book Club Civil War."
22:49;22:53;"I have no idea what the plot is. It's just Book Club Civil War."
22:53;22:59;"But all right. Well, to be fair. Okay. So the book that you guys started reading, we could talk about it."
22:59;23:09;"Don't you can't start it. It wasn't like we started reading it. We said on the thread that we're all going to start reading it together."
23:09;23:13;"That we started reading. We said, Oh, we're all going to order this."
23:13;23:17;"Although, yeah, I will say, yeah, go ahead."
23:17;23:22;"I'll say that. I'll just say that I abandoned the book as soon as like the book club went off course."
23:22;23:28;"I was on page like 60 or something. I was like, oh, and I got busy and I was like, well, we're not even doing this book anymore."
23:28;23:31;"So I got to I got to pick it back up. I'm ready to read that book."
23:31;23:43;"How far did you get, Nick? I'm like on page 100 because I had the similar thing to Seinfeld when it was clear on the thread that like basically and that this that this episode is really been the nail in the coffin."
23:43;23:50;"I mean, you're just we're not reading a book. It's fine. I mean, I was enjoying it too."
23:50;23:58;"But I do think it was a short maybe the TC book club. It's more about encouraging literacy and support for the publishing industry."
23:58;24:06;"So really, we're just gassing each other up to read books. I consider anybody who reads a book in the TC book club."
24:06;24:13;"It's just a club of people who read books. And every time you read a book and you can prove that you read it."
24:13;24:19;"I think all the other guys chip in and get you like a jumbo Butterfinger or something like that."
24:19;24:21;"We can be reading all different books, man."
24:21;24:28;"So would a meeting of this book club then be everybody just talking about the individual books that they read?"
24:28;24:36;"No, man. It's everybody just sitting around eating Butterfingers."
24:36;24:42;"It's more like a party. It's really the candy club."
24:42;24:52;"Well, it's like it's like it's more of a candy club. But it's like if you go to a graduation party with everybody who went to school together,"
24:52;24:58;"you know, and you graduate from high school, you don't you don't have to everybody sit down and say, what was your favorite class?"
24:58;25:03;"Like, we're here just to relax. We all accomplished something. We all did it in our own way."
25:03;25:08;"You know what I'm saying? Like some people got good grades. Some people played sports."
25:08;25:12;"People chose different electives or whatever. Some people took AP chemistry."
25:12;25:16;"Other people took regular chemistry. But I'm saying once we're having the party,"
25:16;25:20;"it's basically a group of people who all accomplished something in different ways,"
25:20;25:27;"coming together just to revel in that sense of accomplishment. And that's what a book club is all about."
25:27;25:31;"The idea that you have to come and discuss the book, that seems really boring."
25:31;25:36;"It kind of seems like raining on the parade of just having finished a book."
25:36;25:43;"So I think this is more of a new I think, especially when you consider that apparently that people read less books than ever."
25:43;25:47;"People spend so much time on the damn Internet. They don't have time to read books anymore."
25:47;25:57;"So I think let's take it back to like first grade is like you and a bunch of adults just kind of gas each other up with stickers and candy to say,"
25:57;26:01;"just did you read a damn book? And if you did, you can come to the party."
26:01;26:08;"I like how we've spent so much time just talking about like the like the book club, but we haven't even mentioned what the other book is."
26:08;26:11;"I don't even know if we should. Maybe it's just a mystery."
26:11;26:18;"We should. The book that we were going to read was Charlie Kaufman, the director's new book,"
26:18;26:24;"that he wrote a novel that was published sort of, you know, about him in quarantine."
26:24;26:31;"And we had all sort of been talking about the TC highbrow challenge and dipping back into some Kaufman movies."
26:31;26:35;"And then Seinfeld said, oh, hey, there's this. He's got a novel."
26:35;26:43;"And Ezra, you followed up saying, great, we should all read that for the DC book club."
26:43;26:48;"And I said, oh, yeah, I got it in the mail. That sounds perfect. And Jake said, I'm in."
26:48;26:58;"Did I? Yes. And then the next day you said, I'm reading chaos. And as we said, great, I'll get it right now."
26:58;27:02;"No, because I didn't. I don't know what happened. No, that's not what happened."
27:02;27:05;"That's that's a great distortion. Let me get Tom O'Neill."
27:05;27:11;"When Tom O'Neill's next book needs to be investigating the DC book club."
27:11;27:19;"I had already received an ordered chaos from Skylight Books, supporting an L.A. independent bookstore."
27:19;27:24;"And I got it. Exactly. I ordered the paperback from Skylight."
27:24;27:31;"I got it in the mail the same week that we were texting about reading the Charlie Kaufman novel."
27:31;27:37;"This is like Bad Stern when they get into like inter-office politics."
27:37;27:43;"And then Gary said, OK, and then so I started reading chaos because I was there."
27:43;27:47;"And then I posted this is getting so dark office politics."
27:47;27:54;"I posted on Instagram, OK, dude, a picture of me reading chaos."
27:54;27:58;"And I was like, has anyone read this? And like, you know, a few TC heads responded that they had."
27:58;28:02;"And then Ezra hit me up. Maybe I'm wrong. I think this is right."
28:02;28:05;"Ezra hit me up and DM was like, oh, I just I just ordered that."
28:05;28:11;"That sounds right. No mention of Charlie Kaufman book. No mention of dissing the TC book club."
28:11;28:13;"It just organically happened, man."
28:13;28:20;"I also just want to point out, wasn't Ezra the one who first brought to our attention that Charlie Kaufman had written a novel?"
28:20;28:23;"I feel like that actually wasn't me. I could be wrong."
28:23;28:29;"I think it's possible. The timeline is a mess. There's obvious inconsistencies and omissions."
28:29;28:31;"We really need to get to the bottom of this."
28:31;28:38;"Also, at some point I told you guys that I was reading Dark Star, an oral biography of Jerry Garcia."
28:38;28:41;"Yeah, that's why I didn't start chaos immediately."
28:41;28:46;"So I ripped through Dark Star. Then I read chaos. And now I'm going to read the Charlie Kaufman book."
28:46;28:52;"So, you know, you guys are going to owe me three, three butterfingers pretty soon."
28:52;28:57;"So I'm looking back at the thread and it says you sent a picture to the thread."
28:57;29:02;"Jake reading out back, say my current vibe picture of chaos."
29:02;29:06;"OK, as we go, it's just bought that to you say it's a very fun read."
29:06;29:10;"First 100 pages flew by."
29:10;29:16;"And then Seinfeld chimes in. I'm 46 pages into this Kaufman book."
29:16;29:20;"You go to book club versus book club."
29:20;29:23;"And then and then Ezra tries to make everyone feel better."
29:23;29:27;"He goes, oh, I bought the Kaufman book to going to try to read both."
29:27;29:31;"Wow. Oh, and then also got Dark Star."
29:31;29:33;"Can you go back, though? This is actually great."
29:33;29:38;"I mean, can you take it back to who first identified the Kaufman book?"
29:38;29:41;"Just for my own sanity, I have the worst memory."
29:41;29:48;"Jake, you didn't even remember that clones walk among us, man."
29:48;29:51;"Oh, I forgot about that. Oh, yeah, man."
29:51;29:56;"So Matt just sent me a screencap where Ezra introduces."
29:56;29:59;"This is as we're starting the conversation. Charlie Kaufman."
29:59;30:05;"What's the date here? The date is August 1st, 204 p.m."
30:05;30:08;"Ezra, Charlie Kaufman has a new book out. Right."
30:08;30:13;"Curious about it. Me. Yeah, I just started it because I ordered it."
30:13;30:17;"Enjoying it a lot so far. Seinfeld. I didn't know about it. Looks great."
30:17;30:20;"Now, this is where it gets. This is where it gets interesting."
30:20;30:25;"Jake, maybe this could be a legit first."
30:25;30:29;"So the idea of having all of us reading it came from you."
30:29;30:34;"God, I'm getting just look like an ass here."
30:34;30:39;"Well, I also want to point out, though, that this whole conversation you said was August 1st."
30:39;30:44;"Yes. Jerry Garcia's birthday. It's also National Mustard Day."
30:44;30:50;"It's Jake and I are both big fans of mustard beer."
30:50;30:54;"Yeah. So I think it's very possible that for me, we had this conversation."
30:54;30:58;"I was thinking about I think that, yeah, I want to read this Charlie Kaufman book."
30:58;31:06;"But maybe it hadn't dawned on me yet that we were about to enter the days between August 1st through August 9th."
31:06;31:12;"And so I think probably I didn't realize because it was just, you know, day one of the days between."
31:12;31:15;"I bet the next couple of days there was just something in the air."
31:15;31:23;"And I was like, you know what? I want to read because people have been telling me about this oral biography, Dark Star, for a long time, which I also think is great."
31:23;31:27;"So I think I wanted to read that. And by the way, I also want to draw another connection."
31:27;31:34;"This is pretty freaky. But check this. There are two very significant events."
31:34;31:42;"I'm sure you could add others that are in a way the true end of the hippie era and they're decades apart."
31:42;31:48;"One is, of course, the Manson murders that happened in 1969."
31:48;31:53;"And, you know, Joan Didion famously said something like that was the end of the 60s."
31:53;31:58;"It freaked people out in L.A. and I've talked to people who lived through that era in L.A."
31:58;32:05;"And it really is just like, man, we used to be everybody's partying together and hanging out and really felt like we were entering the age of Aquarius."
32:05;32:12;"Doors were unlocked. All this the chill it sent over the Los Angeles area and the whole nation was serious."
32:12;32:15;"And of course, when you read chaos, you'll think about that a lot."
32:15;32:17;"Although he does dispel that a little bit."
32:17;32:22;"He dispels it a little bit, but it definitely there's a lot of information just to say that it freaked people out."
32:22;32:24;"Yeah, for sure."
32:24;32:32;"Much later, I would say the death of Jerry Garcia was also in 1995 was also something that truly felt like the end of an era."
32:32;32:46;"And I think the death of Jerry Garcia, even though I was only 11, then I think the reason that his death more than obviously there are the deaths of Hendrix and Janis Joplin, all these people in the 60s, Jim Morrison in the early 70s."
32:46;33:01;"But part of the reason that his death was so meaningful to people is because the Grateful Dead had kept a type of hippie universe alive long after the 60s, long after taking acid and being a hippie had ceased to be fashionable."
33:01;33:05;"The Grateful Dead were this last bastion of it, keeping that ember alive."
33:05;33:08;"So there was something really sad and meaningful to people."
33:08;33:15;"I think when Jerry died, it wasn't just the tragedy of his death, which of course is sad, but he represented something."
33:15;33:21;"Anyway, that's all to say these two events that were 26 years apart, both August 9th."
33:21;33:28;"There's something about maybe just because I have to be reading those books back to back and I was just like, man, that's freaky that they both were August 9th."
33:28;33:32;"And increasingly, obviously this year, the whole year is crazy."
33:32;33:35;"But I was like, August is a fascinating month."
33:35;33:37;"In some ways, it's a very chill month."
33:37;33:39;"You relax."
33:39;33:41;"It's the dog days of summer."
33:41;33:43;"If you're a kid, you're not in school."
33:43;33:45;"So maybe you take it easy."
33:45;33:49;"If you live somewhere where it's really hot, the heat's so oppressive, all you can do is just hang out."
33:49;33:53;"In some ways, it could be a very placid, chill month."
33:53;33:57;"But it's also, you know, there's a lot of heavy energy in August."
34:41;34:43;"So I think that there was something cool."
34:43;34:45;"The Dark Star and Chaos was a good combo."
34:45;34:48;"But now I am going to move into the Charlie Kaufman book."
34:48;34:53;"And I hope that there's also some parallels in that book,"
34:53;34:56;"because that's a real interesting trifecta."
34:56;34:59;"Who's going to join me in the trifecta?"
34:59;35:00;"That's what I want to know."
35:00;35:01;"This is the real book club."
35:01;35:03;"All three books."
35:03;35:04;"Damn, well, I have Dark Star."
35:04;35:05;"I haven't cracked it yet."
35:05;35:08;"I'll have to pick up the Kaufman."
35:08;35:09;"You're way ahead."
35:09;35:11;"You never even ordered the Kaufman book?"
35:11;35:12;"No."
35:12;35:13;"I think you'll enjoy Dark Star, Jake."
35:13;35:17;"There's many references to the Mill Valley Whole Foods."
35:17;35:17;"Oh, really?"
35:17;35:18;"Later in life."
35:18;35:21;"So you know, those guys after the late '60s,"
35:21;35:25;"they all seemed to be living in various parts of Marin County."
35:25;35:26;"Always moving around."
35:26;35:28;"But Mill Valley was a place that it seemed like a lot of people"
35:28;35:29;"converged on."
35:29;35:31;"And there's a quote in that book, which"
35:31;35:33;"I almost feel like I saw in another book before."
35:33;35:37;"But basically, a guy's talking about Jerry's duality,"
35:37;35:39;"his dual nature."
35:39;35:40;"And he was saying, like-- because obviously, people"
35:40;35:43;"were very concerned with his health in his latter years."
35:43;35:46;"He had gone into a coma in the late '80s."
35:46;35:48;"He was unhealthy."
35:48;35:50;"And yet, he was a very strong person."
35:50;35:52;"And you know, sometimes it's hard for people"
35:52;35:55;"to tell what was going on."
35:55;35:58;"And one person says, yeah, man, people are always"
35:58;36:01;"spotting Jerry in the Mill Valley Whole Foods."
36:01;36:03;"But a lot of times, you'd see him there at lunch,"
36:03;36:06;"eating all healthy at the Mill Valley Whole Foods."
36:06;36:10;"And then that same day, you'd see him at the 7-Eleven,"
36:10;36:12;"crushing Slurpees and hot dogs."
36:12;36:14;"And that was his way of saying, like, he's"
36:14;36:17;"a dude who would try to be healthy."
36:17;36:20;"But he also had this side of him that was kind of like--"
36:20;36:22;"just wanted to eat junk or whatever."
36:22;36:26;"And they were trying to almost use that as a metaphor"
36:26;36:29;"for the two sides of him, like the kind of mystical dude,"
36:29;36:32;"and yet also the earthy guy, the guy who"
36:32;36:34;"wanted to expand his mind, but also the guy"
36:34;36:36;"who was addicted to heroin."
36:36;36:38;"But anyway, that got me thinking, like, oh, man,"
36:38;36:41;"there was, like, a popping Whole Foods in the Bay Area"
36:41;36:42;"in the early '90s."
36:42;36:44;"It made me realize I don't really"
36:44;36:47;"have a good handle on the Whole Foods timeline."
36:47;36:48;"Have you been to this one, Jake?"
36:48;36:50;"Oh, yeah, many times."
36:50;36:54;"I actually used to deliver groceries out of there."
36:54;36:57;"You've talked about your job delivering"
36:57;36:59;"groceries for Whole Foods."
36:59;37:03;"But I always pictured that being in the city, in San Francisco."
37:03;37:04;"It was both."
37:04;37:08;"I worked out of the store on California and Van Ness,"
37:08;37:11;"which is where I would see Kirk Hammett sometimes."
37:11;37:12;"Oh, yeah."
37:12;37:15;"But then sometimes I would get sent up to deliver out"
37:15;37:17;"of the Mill Valley Whole Foods."
37:17;37:19;"And I remember-- so I'd go there and pick up"
37:19;37:21;"these grocery orders, kind of like an early version"
37:21;37:23;"of, like, Instacart."
37:23;37:25;"And so there were some people who"
37:25;37:27;"had been working at that Whole Foods for a long time."
37:27;37:30;"This would have been '05."
37:30;37:34;"So I guess only like 10 years after Jerry was dead."
37:34;37:37;"'05, '06 is when I was doing this job."
37:37;37:39;"And the people that had been working there the whole time,"
37:39;37:42;"a couple people were like, oh, man, I saw Jerry in here"
37:42;37:43;"the day he died."
37:43;37:43;"Whoa."
37:43;37:44;"Yeah."
37:44;37:45;"Heavy."
37:45;37:47;"I don't think I had any Grateful Dead t-shirts or anything"
37:47;37:48;"at that time."
37:48;37:50;"I don't know what."
37:50;37:55;"People are just, like, wanting to talk about Jerry"
37:55;37:58;"in that Mill Valley Whole Foods."
37:58;38:00;"That makes it so much funnier."
38:00;38:02;"Because, like, yeah, I could totally picture you just"
38:02;38:05;"being a fan, wearing a shirt, or just making small talk,"
38:05;38:06;"and being like--"
38:06;38:08;"I don't know, or being like, I noticed you had an acoustic"
38:08;38:10;"guitar in your car, man."
38:10;38:11;"Just be like, oh, yeah, what kind of--"
38:11;38:14;"but it's also funnier just to picture, like,"
38:14;38:18;"a kind of burned out, old, gray ponytail dude."
38:18;38:20;"And you're just kind of like, I'm"
38:20;38:22;"here to pick up the Johnson order."
38:22;38:24;"And he's like, here you go, man."
38:24;38:26;"Hey, I saw Jerry in here the day he died."
38:26;38:29;"You're just like, all right."
38:29;38:30;"Cool."
38:30;38:32;"Jerry Garcia, right?"
38:32;38:33;"Yeah, man."
38:33;38:34;"Garcia."
38:34;38:35;"OK."
38:35;38:36;"All right."
38:36;38:37;"I wonder what the vibe was."
38:37;38:40;"Because, like, obviously, Whole Foods now, it's owned by Amazon."
38:40;38:43;"People have an expectation that it's going to be--"
38:43;38:45;"you know, it's a giant chain."
38:45;38:47;"They want it to be exactly the same, more or less,"
38:47;38:48;"wherever you go."
38:48;38:51;"But I got to imagine that, like, in early '90s,"
38:51;38:54;"Mill Valley Whole Foods, like, probably"
38:54;38:58;"did feel kind of, like, local."
38:58;39:00;"You know, like, Whole Foods doesn't feel local anymore."
39:00;39:01;"Right."
39:01;39:02;"Yeah."
39:02;39:05;"My understanding, there's a big fan of the show,"
39:05;39:07;"a friend of mine, Emily Alexander,"
39:07;39:09;"who's from North Carolina."
39:09;39:11;"Her dad ran an organic grocery store."
39:11;39:15;"And I think around the time of, you know, the expansion, what"
39:15;39:17;"they would really do is they would just sort of go"
39:17;39:20;"to local, successful organic grocery stores."
39:20;39:22;"And they would sort of put their name on them."
39:22;39:26;"But they would still operate, like, really local businesses."
39:26;39:28;"Finding local partners."
39:28;39:31;"Yeah, so it wasn't sort of homogenized the way it is now."
39:31;39:32;"They would be local partners."
39:32;39:34;"And they would sort of buy them out and put their name on,"
39:34;39:36;"but let them keep operating."
39:36;39:38;"I feel like this isn't talked about enough,"
39:38;39:40;"is that, you know, obviously, there's"
39:40;39:43;"a lot of conversation about the way that the internet"
39:43;39:46;"and before the internet, big box stores"
39:46;39:50;"were kind of crushing independent record stores."
39:50;39:52;"And obviously, some have still survived."
39:52;39:53;"And COVID is yet another challenge, you know."
39:53;39:55;"Like, independent record stores can't"
39:55;39:56;"catch a [BLEEP] break."
39:56;39:59;"But people often talk about the fact"
39:59;40:03;"that independent record stores, even though they would"
40:03;40:05;"have a lot of the same music, they had a certain personality."
40:05;40:06;"I was actually just--"
40:06;40:07;"I got a shout out."
40:07;40:10;"The Other Music documentary, I think"
40:10;40:12;"I appear in it briefly as a talking head."
40:12;40:13;"I did the interview a few years ago."
40:13;40:15;"But it's a documentary that's totally"
40:15;40:16;"about this one store in New York,"
40:16;40:19;"Other Music, which is a legendary record"
40:19;40:22;"store, very small, like, truly a tiny record store."
40:22;40:24;"But, you know, it had vibe."
40:24;40:25;"The way they organized the music,"
40:25;40:27;"the people who worked there, it was just cool."
40:27;40:30;"I went there for the first time, I think, when I was 14."
40:30;40:33;"And it really made an impact on me, that store."
40:33;40:35;"So, you know, we talk a lot about the way"
40:35;40:38;"that record stores used to provide a sense of community"
40:38;40:39;"or a sense of vibe."
40:39;40:42;"And it's a real loss that we have less of them now."
40:42;40:44;"But I think a less discussed phenomenon"
40:44;40:48;"is the independent organics store,"
40:48;40:50;"because that is, like, a real thing."
40:50;40:51;"And Whole Foods--"
40:51;40:54;"I mean, Whole Foods probably has provided access"
40:54;40:56;"to certain types of food in other parts of the country"
40:56;40:58;"that maybe were harder back in the day."
40:58;41:01;"But I have really fond memories of, like, growing up"
41:01;41:05;"and going to, like, the dude with the gray ponytail,"
41:05;41:08;"just, like, ramshackle, like, almost, like,"
41:08;41:12;"used bookstore energy, organic health food store."
41:12;41:14;"I love those places."
41:14;41:16;"Always playing jazz."
41:16;41:18;"That's my memory, that they're always playing jazz."
41:18;41:21;"And just, like, the smell of it and, like, the funky feel"
41:21;41:25;"and, like, the characters you'd see, the community--"
41:25;41:26;"what would you call it?"
41:26;41:26;"The community message-- - Bulletin board."
41:26;41:28;"- Bulletin board."
41:28;41:30;"Like, those places had such vibe."
41:30;41:32;"And of course, they still exist in some pockets."
41:32;41:34;"But I feel, like, similar to record stores."
41:34;41:37;"It's, like, they're a bit of a dying breed, you know?"
41:37;41:38;"- Oh, for sure."
41:38;41:41;"I wonder-- because when I went to that Whole Foods a lot"
41:41;41:45;"in '05 and '06 in Mill Valley, it felt like a pretty"
41:45;41:48;"straightforward Whole Foods."
41:48;41:51;"It didn't feel like it was-- it had traces of any sort of,"
41:51;41:54;"like, more local or unique origin story."
41:54;41:56;"- It was corporate at that point."
41:56;41:57;"- Fully."
41:57;41:59;"I mean, I wonder if there was a market that would have been"
41:59;42:04;"a good place to expand into in the early days for Whole Foods,"
42:04;42:07;"then, like, Marin County would have been primo."
42:07;42:09;"Probably would have been one of the first--"
42:09;42:10;"I'm just guessing, but I bet it's one of the first--"
42:10;42:12;"- That's a great question, is was that--"
42:12;42:15;"how much had Whole Foods expanded outside of Texas"
42:15;42:15;"at that point?"
42:15;42:17;"Was that one of the first in California,"
42:17;42:19;"first in the whole nation?"
42:19;42:22;"- I believe the Mill Valley store is the 12th store."
42:22;42:23;"- Oh, that's early."
42:23;42:27;"- It's early, and what I'm reading right here that's"
42:27;42:31;"interesting is the current co-CEO, Walter Raab,"
42:31;42:36;"he got his start in that they had him open the Mill Valley,"
42:36;42:37;"which was the 12th."
42:37;42:38;"So he--"
42:38;42:39;"- Oh, wow."
42:39;42:43;"- Sort of his storied career, the current CEO,"
42:43;42:47;"started by opening the Mill Valley one."
42:47;42:47;"- He probably-- - And this is early,"
42:47;42:49;"that's '89."
42:49;42:51;"- He probably brushed shoulders with Jerry a lot."
42:51;42:53;"- He must have."
42:53;42:58;"He worked there for, I think, eight years, from '89."
42:58;42:59;"So yeah, he definitely did."
42:59;43:01;"- Wow."
43:01;43:02;"- I mean, I'm just looking--"
43:02;43:04;"I'll read, while we do this, maybe for another day,"
43:04;43:07;"I'm gonna read this Whole Foods market history,"
43:07;43:11;"but when you see the photo of, like,"
43:11;43:14;"the original Whole Foods market, it's real crunchy."
43:14;43:16;"- I think I've seen that 'cause it was a house, right?"
43:16;43:18;"- Well, this one, it's like,"
43:18;43:20;"some of the employees aren't wearing shirts."
43:20;43:21;"- Right."
43:21;43:22;"- Wow."
43:22;43:23;"- You know, they're just, like, hanging."
43:23;43:25;"I mean, it's really, it's a vibe."
43:25;43:28;"- Remember on the show we talked about, like,"
43:28;43:31;"was Willie Nelson hanging at the original Whole Foods much?"
43:31;43:32;"- Right."
43:32;43:34;"- You know what actually could be a TC project?"
43:34;43:35;"This could be it, Jake."
43:35;43:37;"I think this could be our chaos."
43:37;43:40;"We do an oral history of Whole Foods."
43:40;43:41;"- Whoa."
43:41;43:42;"- Obviously, it's a bit of a pipe dream."
43:42;43:45;"For us to do it right might take a long time."
43:45;43:47;"Maybe if we do it as an oral history,"
43:47;43:49;"that's a little bit easier."
43:49;43:50;"I mean, I'm sure it's still very difficult"
43:50;43:52;"to make an oral history readable and stuff,"
43:52;43:55;"but if we get a good editor, they could help us."
43:55;43:58;"But, like, we roll out to Austin for two weeks,"
43:58;44:01;"just conducting hours of interviews."
44:01;44:03;"And then we kind of follow the early Whole Foods,"
44:03;44:05;"and then we get into the Amazon era."
44:05;44:07;"We're interviewing, like, people in corporate,"
44:07;44:10;"the lawyers who brokered the deal, employees."
44:10;44:12;"- Weirdly, I bet the last 10 years of Whole Foods"
44:12;44:15;"would be much harder to cover."
44:15;44:17;"- Well, we could have some color that's like,"
44:17;44:20;"you know, we put in the request to interview Bezos"
44:20;44:22;"in 2023."
44:22;44:24;"By 2032, we couldn't believe"
44:24;44:27;"that we were still working on this book,"
44:27;44:29;"but then the call finally came."
44:29;44:30;"Bezos is ready to talk."
44:30;44:33;"You guys have 10 minutes on Saturday."
44:33;44:35;"Jake and I looked at each other like, holy (beep)."
44:35;44:39;"We let our lives fall apart for this Whole Foods book."
44:39;44:41;"Jake stopped painting, I stopped making music."
44:41;44:43;"Could this be the key to unlock it all?"
44:43;44:45;"The Bezos interview."
44:45;44:48;"Like, then, like, Saturday morning, he canceled."
44:48;44:49;"No reason was given."
44:49;44:52;"- His assistant insisted that we stop calling."
44:52;44:55;"- Dejected, we walked back to the Winnebago"
44:55;44:57;"that we'd been living in for the previous five years."
44:57;45:00;"Well, let's head to Mill Valley one more time."
45:00;45:03;"See what we... (laughs)"
45:03;45:04;"Let's sniff around."
45:04;45:06;"Maybe that's too ambitious,"
45:06;45:10;"but I like the idea of doing an oral history."
45:10;45:12;"What if we try to... (laughs)"
45:12;45:15;"We try to get Willie Nelson for the first interview."
45:15;45:19;"Willie, so great to talk to you."
45:19;45:20;"Huge fans of the music anyway."
45:20;45:24;"What are your memories of the first Whole Foods in Austin?"
45:24;45:28;"Oh, okay, well, we buy groceries there."
45:28;45:30;"Good, healthy groceries."
45:30;45:31;"There's a lot of interesting stuff"
45:31;45:32;"happening in that area in Austin."
45:32;45:37;"Willie, please, please keep it focused on Whole Foods."
45:37;45:39;"So how did you feel when you heard about Amazon buying?"
45:39;45:41;"Oh, Amazon bought it?"
45:41;45:43;"Oh, I didn't know that."
45:43;45:45;"Good for them. (laughs)"
45:45;45:47;"- Did you ever personally meet John Mackey?"
45:47;45:50;"Who? (laughs)"
45:50;45:51;"- Wait, who's John Mackey?"
45:51;45:52;"I don't know who John Mackey is."
45:52;45:54;"- He's the founder/CEO."
45:54;45:56;"I mean, he founded it with a few other people,"
45:56;45:59;"but he emerged as the sort of guy"
45:59;46:02;"that was willing to ratchet it up"
46:02;46:05;"from local health food store to corporate behemoth."
46:05;46:06;"- Is he alive?"
46:06;46:07;"- He's alive."
46:07;46:08;"Oh yeah, he's still involved in the company,"
46:08;46:09;"I'm pretty sure."
46:09;46:11;"He's still the CEO."
46:11;46:12;"- Okay, so just for the hell of it,"
46:12;46:14;"let's reach out via TC"
46:14;46:17;"and see if we can get John Mackey on the show."
46:17;46:19;"- There's absolutely no way in hell that's happening."
46:19;46:21;"He was the guy that, remember a few years ago,"
46:21;46:24;"there was a story, like he was going on message boards"
46:24;46:26;"and posting under a pseudonym"
46:26;46:28;"about how awesome Whole Foods was?"
46:28;46:30;"- Are you serious?"
46:30;46:32;"- Or there was like a Whole Foods,"
46:32;46:33;"I forget the details."
46:33;46:36;"- You're absolutely right, Jake."
46:37;46:40;"The headline is Whole Foods CEO"
46:40;46:41;"admits to message board posts."
46:41;46:44;"And then the kicker is, says John Mackey"
46:44;46:47;"of his Yahoo Finance forays, quote,"
46:47;46:48;"""I had fun doing it."""
46:48;46:50;"I mean, you know, that's cool."
46:50;46:51;"If he wants to ever,"
46:51;46:53;"a lot of people post anonymously on the internet."
46:53;46:55;"I guess he has every right to too."
46:55;46:56;"I mean, I don't know."
46:56;46:58;"- Good for Mackey for just coming out."
46:58;47:03;"♪ I've got a long list of real good reasons ♪"
47:03;47:06;"♪ For all the things I've done ♪"
47:06;47:10;"♪ I've got a picture in the back of my mind ♪"

47:21;47:26;"♪ And regret is just a memory written on my brow ♪"
47:26;47:30;"♪ And there's nothing I can do about it now ♪"
47:30;47:33;"- I just want to say, to be clear about Mackey,"
47:33;47:34;"when we're talking about, he went on,"
47:34;47:37;"this is just because I think you guys will appreciate this."
47:37;47:40;"When he went on to the Yahoo message boards,"
47:40;47:45;"he was trolling the wild oats market, which is their rival."
47:45;47:47;"- Oh, sure."
47:47;47:50;"- And so he would go on and say, this is, quote,"
47:50;47:51;"""The writing is on the wall."
47:51;47:54;"""The end game is now underway for oats."""
47:54;47:55;"And then, this is great,"
47:55;47:57;"'cause obviously this is someone that works there"
47:57;47:59;"and not just some dude on a message board."
47:59;48:01;"Quote, ""Whole Foods is systematically"
48:01;48:03;"""destroying their viability as a business."""

48:18;48:21;"I think he was sued because you can't have a CEO"
48:21;48:25;"trying to hurt the stock of another company."
48:25;48:27;"- Yeah, that kind of seems like,"
48:27;48:30;"it's not quite insider trading, but-"
48:30;48:33;"- But that seems so tame compared to, like,"
48:33;48:35;"the disinformation on, like, Fox News"
48:35;48:37;"or any political campaign."
48:37;48:39;"I mean, I don't know."
48:39;48:42;"Some guy on a message board saying wild oats is booked."
48:42;48:44;"I mean, isn't that what happens on, like,"
48:44;48:47;"it's funny, I've, like, never watched CNBC."
48:47;48:49;"My, like, main understanding of it"
48:49;48:51;"comes from, like, watching, like, billions of movies,"
48:51;48:53;"you know, TV shows or movies."
48:53;48:56;"But that seems like he would be allowed to publicly"
48:56;48:58;"go on, like, Jim Cramer, and Cramer's like,"
48:58;49:00;"""Well, listen, you're gonna have a hard time"
49:00;49:01;"""in some of these markets, Mackie."

49:43;49:46;"I mean, it would be way more, like, chaos vibe"
49:46;49:49;"if it really was, like, an expose on Mackie."
49:49;49:50;"Sounds like a complicated figure."
49:50;49:52;"- I mean-- - That might be less fun,"
49:52;49:55;"but that's literally, like, we're going to his hometown,"
49:55;49:58;"interviewing childhood friends, family, teachers."
49:58;50:02;"- I heard a radio, like, an NPR piece or something,"
50:02;50:06;"like, a podcast years ago that was on this topic."
50:06;50:08;"And, like, they interviewed,"
50:08;50:10;"this is kind of a fuzzy memory, admittedly,"
50:10;50:12;"but they interviewed some of, like,"
50:12;50:15;"Mackie's co-founders of Whole Foods,"
50:15;50:18;"the sort of, like, local health food market guys."
50:18;50:21;"And they were like, ""Yeah, no, John was always very focused"

50:33;50:34;"- Interesting. - That's my memory of this."

50:37;50:39;"author of ""Chaos,"" on the program,"
50:39;50:40;"maybe you could give us some tips."
50:40;50:43;"Like, maybe we do have to spend, like, 10 years"
50:43;50:45;"creating our oral history of Whole Foods,"
50:45;50:50;"and then finally we can prevail upon Mackie to be like,"
50:50;50:52;"""Sir, we'd love for you to say your piece,"
50:52;50:57;"""because right now we have tens of thousands of hours"
50:57;51:00;"""of interviews with thousands of people,"
51:00;51:01;"""many of whom are talking about you,"
51:01;51:03;"""and we just wanna be fair here."""
51:03;51:06;"And he'll just be like, ""You know, we're considering"
51:06;51:08;"""wrapping this up and publishing the book next year,"
51:08;51:10;"""and we'd love just to get your take."""
51:10;51:12;"And then he's like, ""All right."""
51:12;51:14;"- He's on his deathbed. - Mackie's willing to sit down."
51:14;51:15;"(laughing)"
51:15;51:17;"- And he's just like, ""Okay."""
51:17;51:19;"- Bring it, Ezra and Jake."
51:19;51:22;"- He finally admits that he was a CIA asset."
51:22;51:25;"(laughing)"
51:25;51:26;"- Whole Foods."
51:27;51:28;"(laughing)"
51:28;51:30;"- Destabilize."
51:30;51:31;"I mean, (beep) man."
51:31;51:33;"- No, no, no. - After eating chaos."
51:33;51:35;"- Dude, the CIA and the intelligence community"
51:35;51:39;"started Whole Foods as a way to make the left"
51:39;51:42;"in this country complacent and turn them into consumers."
51:42;51:43;"- Wow."
51:43;51:44;"(laughing)"
51:44;51:45;"- Get on Twitter with that."
51:45;51:47;"Whole Foods and CIA front."
51:47;51:50;"(laughing)"
51:50;51:51;"- Okay, wait, we gotta move on shortly,"
51:51;51:55;"but just to see if there's anything here."
51:55;51:57;"- Seinfeld, let me get a quick Google."
51:57;51:59;"Whole Foods CIA."
51:59;52:00;"- Someone's already uncovered this."
52:00;52:03;"- There's a lot of Reddit stuff"
52:03;52:04;"where it's kind of like this snarky-"
52:04;52:06;"- That's a valid source."
52:06;52:07;"- Like, okay."
52:07;52:09;"(laughing)"
52:09;52:11;"I guess what I'm seeing is like some Reddit type of stuff"
52:11;52:15;"that's like, like Amazon is the CIA."
52:15;52:17;"So when Amazon bought Whole Foods,"
52:17;52:19;"it's like the CIA bought Whole Foods."
52:19;52:21;"So I think it sort of like ladders up"
52:22;52:25;"into some sort of like Amazon CIA conspiracy theory."
52:25;52:29;"- That's a little less interesting."
52:29;52:30;"- Yeah, 'cause Amazon was always very"
52:30;52:34;"just like baldly capitalist and brutal."
52:34;52:37;"It's much more interesting if the CIA"
52:37;52:39;"tricked all the hippies into-"
52:39;52:41;"- It's way better if it's like Amazon,"
52:41;52:45;"you know, refused to ever collaborate with the CIA."
52:45;52:48;"And finally, the CIA was able to Trojan horse their way"
52:48;52:51;"into the organization through the purchase of Whole Foods,"
52:51;52:53;"which they had owned since 1972."
52:53;52:58;"Which they've been a front since 1972."
52:58;52:59;"All right, if anybody,"
52:59;53:02;"let us know if you think that's a good idea."
53:02;53:04;"Would you cop?"
53:04;53:06;"And it's not gonna, look, it's gonna be a serious book."
53:06;53:07;"It's not gonna be, you know,"
53:07;53:10;"kind of classic TC banter, our flights of fancy."
53:10;53:12;"This is gonna be a serious, you know,"
53:12;53:14;"you're not necessarily gonna have me and Jake's voice"
53:14;53:16;"that much in it."
53:16;53:17;"'Cause I think that might discredit"
53:17;53:19;"like our research a little bit,"
53:19;53:20;"if we make it too personal."
53:20;53:21;"- Right."
53:21;53:24;"- Anyway, we got a special guest coming up."
53:24;53:28;"Coming back to the show is Brian Jones,"
53:28;53:32;"Vampire Weekend guitarist, musician extraordinaire,"
53:32;53:34;"tie-dye guru."
53:34;53:37;"And you might recall that he was on the show"
53:37;53:41;"a few months ago talking about his love of NSYNC,"
53:41;53:44;"specifically the albums ""No Strings Attached."""
53:44;53:45;"Well, guess what?"
53:45;53:49;"He has now recorded a full song by song tribute"
53:49;53:51;"to ""No Strings Attached"" and it's out now."
53:51;53:53;"So we're gonna check in with him."
53:53;53:56;"- Now let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
53:56;53:59;"(phone ringing)"
53:59;54:01;"- What up?"
54:01;54:02;"- What's up, Brian?"
54:02;54:03;"- Hey."
54:03;54:04;"- 'Sup, man?"
54:04;54:05;"- Right off the bat, I got a question for you."
54:05;54:06;"- Let's hear it."
54:06;54:09;"- What's your earliest memory of Whole Foods?"
54:09;54:12;"Did you have a local one growing up in Virginia?"
54:12;54:14;"- No, we did not have a local Whole Foods."
54:14;54:18;"I think, I don't know what my earliest memory is."
54:18;54:19;"I just remember hearing about it"
54:19;54:22;"and knowing it was expensive,"
54:22;54:24;"but I didn't really ever go to Whole Foods"
54:24;54:28;"until I was in my early 20s."
54:28;54:29;"- So you don't think there was one"
54:29;54:31;"anywhere near where you grew up?"
54:31;54:32;"- Not that I know of."
54:32;54:33;"- Where'd you grow up?"
54:33;54:34;"- Like outside of DC."
54:34;54:35;"There's one there now."
54:35;54:38;"Like there's one in my town now, in Ashburn."
54:38;54:39;"There's one there."
54:39;54:41;"- So you probably wouldn't be interested"
54:41;54:44;"in reading an oral history on Whole Foods, would you?"
54:44;54:45;"- I don't know if I would"
54:45;54:47;"at this particular point in my life,"
54:47;54:50;"but I got a lot of time left on the clock."
54:50;54:52;"- Did you know that the first Whole Foods"
54:52;54:56;"outside of Austin, Texas was actually in Virginia?"
54:56;54:57;"- No way."
54:57;54:58;"Wait, what town?"
54:58;54:59;"Does it say?"
54:59;54:59;"- Langley, Virginia."
54:59;55:00;"- Oh, that's really-"
55:00;55:01;"- No, no, no."
55:01;55:03;"(laughing)"
55:03;55:05;"We're trying to uncover if the CIA"
55:05;55:08;"has any connections to Whole Foods."
55:08;55:09;"- Jesus Christ."
55:09;55:10;"- Could be."
55:10;55:11;"Wait, it's actually,"
55:11;55:13;"before we talk about N'Singh and stuff,"
55:13;55:16;"so growing up close to Langley, Virginia,"
55:16;55:21;"did the CIA loom large in your town or your imagination?"
55:21;55:23;"Or did it seem kind of mundane"
55:23;55:25;"just 'cause you knew that it was nearby?"
55:25;55:27;"- There were a lot of people"
55:27;55:32;"whose parents had mysterious jobs, for sure."
55:32;55:35;"Like mysterious government contractor,"
55:35;55:37;"whatever you wanna call it, jobs."
55:37;55:40;"But certain people, it's like,"
55:40;55:41;"they go to Thanksgiving with their brother"
55:41;55:44;"and they have to blur out their brother's face"
55:44;55:46;"in the pictures on Facebook, like that kind of vibe."
55:46;55:47;"(laughing)"
55:47;55:48;"- What?"
55:48;55:50;"- I remember that distinctly from growing up."
55:50;55:53;"It was only two people I saw that happened with,"
55:53;55:55;"but it did happen."
55:55;55:56;"- Interesting."
55:56;55:57;"- I think post 9/11,"
55:57;56:00;"with all the new homeland security jobs and stuff like that,"
56:00;56:03;"my town just kind of became a hotbed"
56:03;56:05;"for people in government."
56:05;56:09;"- I actually remember you telling me that once,"
56:09;56:12;"'cause how old were you in 2001?"
56:12;56:13;"- I was eight."
56:13;56:16;"- Yeah, 'cause you said when you were growing up,"
56:16;56:18;"so I'm from eight to 18 or whatever,"
56:18;56:22;"you watched your area get way more built up"
56:22;56:25;"and it was partially because of the post 9/11 boom?"
56:25;56:26;"- I think so, yeah."
56:26;56:27;"I think a lot of people,"
56:27;56:31;"and also the internet was a big thing in my town too."
56:31;56:33;"Ashburn, Virginia hosts a lot of the,"
56:33;56:37;"a significant percentage of the internet servers"
56:37;56:38;"of the world."
56:38;56:41;"A lot of the internet traffic runs through there"
56:41;56:44;"and they keep building data centers and stuff like that."
56:44;56:45;"Going there now,"
56:45;56:46;"the drive from the airport to my house"
56:46;56:49;"is so many data centers, it's crazy."
56:49;56:51;"- Well, and I'm sure that's not a coincidence"
56:51;56:55;"that all the servers are in that part of the country."
56:55;56:57;"- Yeah, I can't imagine."
56:57;56:58;"It's not related."
56:58;57:00;"- Well, anyway, how you been, Brian?"
57:00;57:03;"How's the 2020 treating you?"
57:03;57:07;"- You know, I think Justin Timberlake was a little off"
57:07;57:10;"when he was talking about the 2020 experience."
57:10;57:12;"(laughing)"
57:12;57:15;"No, it's cool."
57:15;57:17;"I kind of just called it with this year."
57:17;57:19;"I was like, anything good that happens this year is a bonus."
57:19;57:22;"Like, I'm just gonna be in my room"
57:22;57:26;"and eat breakfast every day and do yoga."
57:26;57:28;"I've been doing a lot of yoga, that's my new thing."
57:28;57:31;"Feeling very limber these days."
57:31;57:32;"- And a lot of tie dying."
57:32;57:35;"- A lot of tie dying, yeah."
57:35;57:36;"It's going good."
57:36;57:38;"Just staying real busy."
57:38;57:39;"- So what's been the journey"
57:39;57:41;"with the ""No Strings Attached"" album?"
57:41;57:42;"Like, now I can't even remember."
57:42;57:45;"The first time you came on ""Time Crisis,"""
57:45;57:47;"were we just talking about the album"
57:47;57:50;"or had you already begun this project?"
57:50;57:52;"- I think I'd already begun it"
57:52;57:54;"'cause that was while (beep) was shut down, I think."
57:54;57:57;"'Cause I started it right before stuff shut down."
57:57;57:59;"- Oh, so this wasn't like a COVID,"
57:59;58:03;"like, let me cook up something just to like go deep on"
58:03;58:05;"while I'm at home story."
58:05;58:07;"This was already something."
58:07;58:11;"- It kind of became that because at the beginning of it,"
58:11;58:13;"like before (beep) shut down,"
58:13;58:15;"I was just like messing around with it."
58:15;58:17;"The 20th anniversary was coming up and I was like,"
58:17;58:19;"""Oh, that'd be fun to do like three or four songs"
58:19;58:22;"from the album and put it out."""
58:22;58:24;"Like, that would be just fun to do."
58:24;58:26;"And then like, you know, everything shut down"
58:26;58:28;"and I was like, ""Eh, well now I have a chance"
58:28;58:29;"to like actually like, you know, produce this."""
58:29;58:32;"So I was like, expanded to five songs."
58:32;58:34;"And then like, you know, then the eight songs."
58:34;58:38;"And then, you know, then I set a deadline for myself"
58:38;58:40;"and then I missed it because I was too focused on like,"
58:40;58:42;"you know, the protests and all that stuff"
58:42;58:43;"when that was going on."
58:43;58:46;"And, you know, once I found a little sense of normalcy"
58:46;58:49;"back in my life, I just decided to expand it a bit more"
58:49;58:52;"to 10 songs and then just finish it."
58:52;58:54;"- So first of all, for anybody who wants to listen,"
58:54;58:57;"it's on all the DSPs, streaming services."
58:57;58:58;"- Yup."
58:58;59:01;"- Is there gonna be a physical release?"
59:01;59:02;"- You know what?"
59:02;59:05;"I was fully planning on doing a vinyl."
59:05;59:06;"I had everything figured out"
59:06;59:09;"and I ran into some licensing issues"
59:09;59:12;"that I'm still attempting to resolve."
59:12;59:16;"But one of my roommates is like deeply into the vinyl game"
59:16;59:18;"and he's like on a mission to get me to make a vinyl."
59:18;59:20;"So I think it'll happen."
59:20;59:21;"- I'd love a copy of this on vinyl."

01:00:17;01:00:20;"in a way that you had, you sing a lot"
01:00:20;01:00:22;"but you also had a bunch of guests."
01:00:22;01:00:26;"- Yes, it's mostly people I went to college with"
01:00:26;01:00:28;"who are musicians I really respect"
01:00:28;01:00:30;"and collaborate with a lot."
01:00:30;01:00:35;"And then also Starchild who I met a couple of years ago."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- Oh yeah, I know him."
01:00:36;01:00:38;"- Yeah, oh yeah, exactly."
01:00:38;01:00:39;"I think yeah, exactly."
01:00:39;01:00:40;"- Great guy, yeah, love him."
01:00:40;01:00:42;"- We played a show together at the Terrogram."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"He was playing with that band, Chairlift,"
01:00:43;01:00:46;"Caroline Polachek's old band."
01:00:46;01:00:49;"And I was playing with Muna and we were opening up"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"and we kind of hit it off pretty immediately."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"So we've stayed friends like over the internet,"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"over the years, we run into each other now and then"
01:00:55;01:00:58;"but this is our first like music thing we've done together."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"And I'm stoked about it."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"- Who's singing lead on Space Cowboy?"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"- It's my friend Alex, but he's going under his name"
01:01:04;01:01:08;"from another project we did together called Whisperfish."
01:01:08;01:01:13;"You might recognize him from the contest Williams Universe."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"This project that I have."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Yeah, he's just like one of my boys"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"and he's like my go-to guitar player for everything."
01:01:19;01:01:22;"And we do a lot of music stuff together."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"And he just like, he wanted to do it."
01:01:24;01:01:25;"And he's like, yeah, I used to sing this on the bus"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"on the way to camp."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"And now I want to record it."
01:01:29;01:01:31;"So he did a great job."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"- He was specifically a Space Cowboy?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"- Oh yeah."

01:02:25;01:02:28;"- How did you approach each song?"
01:02:28;01:02:32;"Because like, it's not exactly like a note for note cover."
01:02:32;01:02:36;"Is there kind of like a range of faithfulness?"
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Or did you want to give everyone a little tweak?"
01:02:38;01:02:41;"Or there's some that are like pretty similar"
01:02:41;01:02:44;"to the originals or like, yeah, how did you negotiate that?"
01:02:44;01:02:48;"- I just knew I wanted to hear some of them"
01:02:48;01:02:51;"as more modern interpretations."
01:02:51;01:02:53;"Like ""Bye Bye Bye"" is a little bit more"
01:02:53;01:02:54;"of like modern production."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"And like, I thought she knew,"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"which is like the acapella one on the record."
01:02:58;01:03:00;"Instead of doing like acapella,"
01:03:00;01:03:04;"I did like the Bon Iver, like harmony engine type thing"
01:03:04;01:03:07;"that he does, like the vocoder thing."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"And just like update it all a little bit."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"But some of it, you know, I just make like this,"
01:03:12;01:03:15;"my like go-to thing is just to make like really funky,"
01:03:15;01:03:18;"like clean strap, punchy drums,"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"like old school drum kids play bass on it."
01:03:20;01:03:22;"Like that's like my bread and butter sort of."
01:03:22;01:03:24;"And a lot of the record is that,"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"like ""Space Cowboy"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"""
01:03:27;01:03:29;"and ""No Strings Attached"" is also kind of like"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"a throwback-y one, like the actual song itself."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"I kind of try to make it sound like"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"an Earth, Wind and Fire song."
01:03:34;01:03:37;"And there's like horns and like scatting on it."
01:03:37;01:03:39;"- Nice. Real horns?"
01:03:39;01:03:39;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:03:39;01:03:44;"My friend Henry, who REL uses a lot for production stuff."
01:03:44;01:03:48;"And I went to USC with him and he, Henry Solomon,"
01:03:48;01:03:49;"he played a bunch of them."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- Oh yeah."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- He plays on ""Summer Girl"" by Haim."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"- Yeah, right, right."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"- He's in the video and everything."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- I've heard a lot about him."
01:03:54;01:03:55;"- Yeah, he's great."
01:03:55;01:03:59;"He played on that and he played on ""This I Promise You"" too,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"which CT is also on."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"- Oh, really?"
01:04:02;01:04:03;"- Yeah, CT-"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- On what? On drums or vocals?"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"- I had him do, so you know, like when we do"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"""Hold You Now Live"", he does like that kind of like"
01:04:09;01:04:10;"pedal steel thing."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"- So I had him do some of that."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"And then I just wanted him to do that."
01:04:15;01:04:18;"And then he sent me back a version of it"
01:04:18;01:04:22;"where he like sampled these two chords in the chorus"
01:04:22;01:04:25;"and just like repeated them a bunch at the end."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"He's like, ""Dude, I don't know if you want to do anything"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"with this, but like, I made this thing at the end."""
01:04:29;01:04:31;"And he just like played drums over it"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"and he played this like crazy guitar solo."
01:04:33;01:04:36;"And I was like, ""Oh hell yeah, like I gotta use this."""
01:04:36;01:04:37;"So the whole outro-"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"- Oh, say, wait, which song is that again?"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"- This is on ""This I Promise You""."
01:04:41;01:04:44;"- So the ""This I Promise You"" on your no strings attached"
01:04:44;01:04:48;"has an extended CT guitar solo at the end?"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"- Yes, the song is seven minutes long."
01:04:50;01:04:51;"- Oh, (beep)"
01:04:51;01:04:55;"- I really wanted one to break seven and it's 6.59"
01:04:55;01:04:59;"and I'm a little sad about it, but you know, whatever."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"I could have just made the master a little longer, but-"
01:05:01;01:05:02;"- You'll jam it out live."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"(laughing)"
01:05:06;01:05:06;"Yeah, exactly."

01:06:24;01:06:26;"at the end, that's when I'll stop loving you."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"And then my friend Alex ripped a nice little solo"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"on Space Cowboy as well."
01:06:31;01:06:35;"I didn't really make it too nerdy music-y,"
01:06:35;01:06:37;"which maybe was a mistake, but you know."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"- Well, you can always do,"
01:06:40;01:06:43;"when you put on the concert for it,"
01:06:43;01:06:44;"you can jam stuff out."
01:06:44;01:06:45;"- Precisely."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"- Wait, now I'm thinking,"
01:06:47;01:06:50;"the NSA is based in Fort Meade, Maryland."
01:06:50;01:06:54;"That can't be too far from Ashburn, Virginia."
01:06:54;01:06:56;"So you could do something that's like,"
01:06:56;01:06:58;"maybe next year, if there's more live music,"
01:06:58;01:07:02;"NSA 2021 performed live at NSA headquarters,"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Fort Meade, Maryland."
01:07:04;01:07:07;"- That would go extremely hard."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"I definitely want to do a live show at some point,"
01:07:08;01:07:10;"but I might do another,"
01:07:10;01:07:12;"I mean, who knows how long we're going to be doing this."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"I might have to do another BRJ and Friends situation"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"with a different album or something."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"- That was my next question was,"
01:07:19;01:07:23;"is your instinct to go, if you do another one,"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"to stay in sync?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"- I'd almost want to jump around."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Like, I mean, there's obviously,"
01:07:27;01:07:28;"like, obviously, you know,"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"I could be very inspired to do a lot more"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"of the NSYNC discography,"
01:07:32;01:07:35;"but I might switch gears a little bit."
01:07:35;01:07:38;"Maybe I go Britney or maybe I do something else."
01:07:38;01:07:39;"I don't really know."
01:07:39;01:07:41;"It's a lot of options out there."
01:07:41;01:07:43;"- I love Britney being a big gear switch."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"(laughing)"
01:07:46;01:07:51;"- No, not really, but you know."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- When you've been on before,"
01:07:52;01:07:55;"obviously we talked so much about this album in particular,"
01:07:55;01:07:59;"but this era of your life, when you were,"
01:07:59;01:08:00;"what year did this album come out?"
01:08:00;01:08:01;"2000?"
01:08:01;01:08:05;"- 2000, so I was seven at the time."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"- I think that's the age where most people,"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"like around seven,"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"you first start to really be aware of, like,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"new music or something."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"You know, kids love music,"
01:08:13;01:08:15;"but it's like, when you're really little,"
01:08:15;01:08:17;"it's like, you're not going to have this perception"
01:08:17;01:08:20;"of, like, necessarily, oh, I like that band NSYNC"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"and I like their new album or something."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"So what are the other things from that era"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"that are real hallmarks for you?"
01:08:26;01:08:29;"Is it the first Britney Spears album or?"
01:08:29;01:08:32;"- I don't think her album cuts are as strong"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"as maybe the NSYNC ones."
01:08:34;01:08:36;"So there was never really any big Britney albums,"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"but I mean, I was consuming all boy band content"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"I could get my hands on."
01:08:41;01:08:42;"- How deep would you go?"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"Would you get like 98 degrees?"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"Was that a bridge too far?"
01:08:46;01:08:49;"- I wasn't into 98 degrees, but I was into O-Tone."
01:08:49;01:08:50;"If you remember O-Tone."
01:08:50;01:08:52;"- They were put together on a TV show?"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"- Yes, they were put together by Lou Pearlman,"
01:08:54;01:08:57;"I believe, on ""Making the Band,"" which is hilarious."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"But if you don't know ""Liquid Dreams"" by O-Tone,"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"that's an incredible boy band song."
01:09:02;01:09:05;"That is beautifully, like, horny, 2000,"
01:09:05;01:09:10;"like, one energy song that's essentially about a wet dream"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"and some weird, like, fantasy woman"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"that these guys are combining with, like,"
01:09:15;01:09:18;"different parts of different celebrities' bodies"
01:09:18;01:09:19;"and personalities."
01:09:19;01:09:20;"- We gotta listen to this for a second."
01:09:20;01:09:23;"Can you throw on ""Liquid Dreams"" by O-Tone?"
01:09:25;01:09:28;"- The music video has those, like, CGI waterfall,"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"like, early 2000s. - Yes."
01:09:30;01:09:30;"- Yeah."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"- Jake, you know this song?"
01:09:33;01:09:34;"- No."

01:09:58;01:10:00;"♪ And she's so fine ♪"
01:10:00;01:10:01;"- Damn."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"- All right, and then this is where they list,"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"not dominatrix, supermodel, beauty queen,"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"and this is where they list all the different parts."

01:10:25;01:10:27;"- Let's just break down that chorus."
01:10:27;01:10:31;"So that's, you're saying you got a mix of Destiny's Child,"
01:10:31;01:10:36;"Madonna's wild style, Janet Jackson's smile,"
01:10:36;01:10:37;"a body like Jennifer?"
01:10:37;01:10:38;"- Lopez?"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- It's unclear if it's, I mean,"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"it's probably Jennifer Lopez,"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"but there were a lot of Jennifers at the time,"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"I feel like, that it technically could have referred to."
01:10:48;01:10:50;"Wait, isn't there a whole song called ""Jennifer's Body""?"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"- I know there's the Megan Fox movie."
01:10:52;01:10:55;"- There was also Jennifer Love Hewitt."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"- Jennifer Love Hewitt."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"- Oh yeah, she was a very big star at the time"
01:10:58;01:11:01;"from like, I Know What You Did Last Summer."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Yeah, ""Jennifer's Body"" is a whole song."
01:11:03;01:11:04;"- Oh."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"- So I think he was really trying to obliquely"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"set up Courtney Love."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"He wanted a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child,"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Madonna's wild style, Janet Jackson's smile,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"and somebody with the kind of, you know,"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"lyrical wit of a Courtney Love."
01:11:17;01:11:20;"And he's saying, ""You're the star of my liquid dream."""
01:11:20;01:11:24;"- Yes, which I believe is like the fantasy woman"
01:11:24;01:11:29;"he's created in his head in order to pleasure himself."
01:11:29;01:11:33;"- This is like some weird, early like,"
01:11:33;01:11:36;"incel kind of anthem or something."
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Like, wait, am I misreading this?"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"Like, the opening line is,"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"""Posters of love surrounding me,"
01:11:42;01:11:43;"lost in the world of fantasy."""
01:11:43;01:11:45;"It's not even like that NSYNC song."
01:11:45;01:11:47;"What's the one that's about like--"
01:11:47;01:11:49;"- Oh, Digital Ghetto?"
01:11:49;01:11:50;"- Right."
01:11:50;01:11:50;"- Digital Ghetto."
01:11:50;01:11:53;"It's not even like, well, we're separated by space,"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"but we can still kind of have cyber sex."
01:11:55;01:11:57;"This is literally a dude being like,"
01:11:57;01:12:00;"""I'm alone in a room surrounded by posters."""
01:12:00;01:12:02;"He's like an otaku."
01:12:02;01:12:06;"He's just like, ""I've got my anime pillows next to me."""
01:12:06;01:12:09;"And every night, a weird Frankenstein woman"
01:12:09;01:12:12;"that I've created in my own mind,"
01:12:12;01:12:15;"that reminds me, there's like a classic old tweet"
01:12:15;01:12:18;"that was something about, maybe you guys have seen it."
01:12:18;01:12:20;"It was like kind of making fun of just like,"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"a kind of like misogynist dude ranking women on the internet"
01:12:23;01:12:24;"when he's like a huge loser."
01:12:24;01:12:27;"And it was kind of like, ""Rihanna's forehead is too big,"""
01:12:27;01:12:31;"he typed as he wiped the Cheeto dust onto his sweatpants."
01:12:31;01:12:32;"- Oh, yeah."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"- Does that sound familiar?"
01:12:33;01:12:35;"That idea of just like people on the internet"
01:12:35;01:12:37;"just being super harsh and just being like,"
01:12:37;01:12:38;"""No way."
01:12:38;01:12:41;"Like, I like Janet Jackson's smile,"
01:12:41;01:12:44;"but you need to throw that on a body like Jennifer's."""
01:12:44;01:12:47;"Now that is a hot chick."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"Like, it's so dark and weird, just like,"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"picture like just somebody alone."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"It's not, it doesn't even have the,"
01:12:54;01:12:55;"at least so far in the song,"
01:12:55;01:12:57;"it doesn't even have the,"
01:12:57;01:12:59;"""Eventually we're gonna meet in real life."""
01:12:59;01:13:01;"Like, maybe you didn't get the girl yet,"
01:13:01;01:13:03;"or you're pining after her, you're separate."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"It's very weird for a big boy band single"
01:13:05;01:13:08;"just to be like, ""I have a lot of posters,"
01:13:08;01:13:12;"and at night, sometimes I have wet dreams"

01:13:14;01:13:15;"That's it."
01:13:15;01:13:16;"(laughing)"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"- What a difference 20 years makes, right?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"I mean, at the time, people were like,"
01:13:19;01:13:22;"""Dude, that's so awesome."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"That's so funny and cool that you thought of that."""
01:13:24;01:13:28;"No one was like, ""Man, this is pathetic."""
01:13:28;01:13:29;"- Yeah."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"Well, I feel like I need to bring up the bridge."

01:15:44;01:15:47;"But it's like, they still have to throw in somebody"

01:15:50;01:15:52;"even for the personality."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"You'd really have to give them props"

01:15:59;01:16:02;"(laughing)"
01:16:02;01:16:05;"This was also early 2000s."
01:16:05;01:16:06;"Who's considered a cool guy then?"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"Just like, looks ain't everything."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"She's got the personality of a Carson Daly."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"(laughing)"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"Of a Craig Kilmore. - Tom Hanks."
01:16:14;01:16:17;"- Craig Kilmore. - Personality of a Tom Hanks."
01:16:17;01:16:19;"Just a cool dude to hang out with."
01:16:19;01:16:19;"- Shaq."
01:16:19;01:16:21;"- She's got Shaq's personality."
01:16:21;01:16:25;"My mama thinks I'm lazy."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"His mom is from a previous generation being like,"
01:16:27;01:16:31;"all you do is stay up there with your anime pillows."
01:16:31;01:16:32;"You spend all this time on the internet"
01:16:32;01:16:36;"obsessing about this Frankenstein woman who doesn't exist."
01:16:36;01:16:37;"Get out there and meet a real girl."

01:16:39;01:16:41;"My friends all think I'm crazy."
01:16:41;01:16:43;"They're like, dude, it's actually cool"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"to come hang out in real life."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"And he's like, no."
01:16:46;01:16:49;"And then this part that we just listened to,"
01:16:49;01:16:50;"it's kind of quiet."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"He said, liquid dreams, my liquid dreams."
01:16:52;01:16:53;"I do kind of love this line."
01:16:53;01:16:57;"Waterfalls and streams, these liquid dreams."

01:16:59;01:17:02;"- Yikes. - It's a great one."
01:17:02;01:17:03;"Okay, now I understand."
01:17:03;01:17:04;"At first I thought he was saying,"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"you are the star of my liquid dreams,"
01:17:06;01:17:08;"but it's even weirder."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"He's not even addressing the Frankenstein."
01:17:10;01:17:14;"You is like us, the listener, or his buddy."
01:17:14;01:17:16;"I dream about a girl who's a mix of all these things."
01:17:16;01:17:18;"Throw in a body like Jennifer's,"
01:17:18;01:17:19;"and guess what, buddy?"
01:17:19;01:17:21;"You got the star of my liquid dreams."
01:17:21;01:17:25;"And look, a lot of times we like to break down songs"
01:17:25;01:17:27;"and talk about what they're going for."
01:17:27;01:17:30;"Obviously, for me as a songwriter, me as a music fan,"
01:17:30;01:17:35;"I don't believe that every song has to be hyper-specific"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"and there can be layers of meaning."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"And as much as I sometimes bring a lot of rigorous logic"
01:17:40;01:17:43;"to our song breakdowns,"
01:17:43;01:17:45;"I don't believe all songs need to adhere to rigorous logic."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"However, one thing I'll say,"
01:17:47;01:17:50;"in pop music, and especially like boy band music,"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"usually the people who write songs,"
01:17:52;01:17:56;"there is a conversation about just what is the song about."
01:17:56;01:17:59;"That doesn't happen in slightly more abstract"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"forms of songwriting."
01:18:00;01:18:05;"People might talk more about mood or is that a cool line?"
01:18:05;01:18:09;"But with a song like this, that is pretty straightforward,"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"there 100% must have been a moment"
01:18:11;01:18:14;"where somebody was like, it was discussed in the room."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Well, so what's the song really about?"
01:18:16;01:18:20;"And somebody was like, this is about either masturbating"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"and picturing this Frankenstein woman,"
01:18:22;01:18:25;"or just literally having a wet dream."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"And somebody else was like, oh, that's awesome."
01:18:27;01:18:28;"Definitely."
01:18:28;01:18:30;"And nobody stopped to think like,"
01:18:30;01:18:33;"none of the other big boy bands really go that route."
01:18:33;01:18:36;"Another thing you could say about boy bands from this era"
01:18:36;01:18:39;"is that everything about them was usually designed"
01:18:39;01:18:42;"to appeal to--"
01:18:42;01:18:43;"- 14 year old girls."
01:18:43;01:18:44;"- To 14 year old girls."
01:18:44;01:18:46;"And if the music and the dancing was good enough,"
01:18:46;01:18:49;"you might get people of all genders and ages"
01:18:49;01:18:50;"interested in them."
01:18:50;01:18:52;"'Cause like, you know, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC,"
01:18:52;01:18:55;"everybody got at least their song stuck in their head"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"here and there."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"But still, their point, a lot of their songs"
01:18:58;01:19:02;"would be about heartbreak and a lot directly addressed"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"to a person they love, to a girl."
01:19:05;01:19:08;"This song is so weird because, again,"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"the you is not the girl."
01:19:10;01:19:12;"I bet if like we look through that,"
01:19:12;01:19:13;"the whole ""No Strings Attached"" album,"
01:19:13;01:19:16;"almost every you is about either the girl"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"that they are split up with,"
01:19:18;01:19:21;"the girl they're pining after, the girl they're with."
01:19:21;01:19:24;"You know, like the you is almost always the girl."
01:19:24;01:19:27;"It's so weird who this is supposed to appeal to."
01:19:27;01:19:29;"Is it supposed to appeal to like the fellas?"
01:19:29;01:19:31;"Just kind of being like, ""Hey guys."""

01:27:37;01:27:39;"So basically, there's a quote somewhere"
01:27:39;01:27:43;"where this person said that video game influenced them."
01:27:43;01:27:45;"And then you looked and saw who was on the video game?"
01:27:45;01:27:46;"- Correct, yeah."
01:27:46;01:27:49;"The Nintendo DS version specifically is what he mentioned."
01:27:49;01:27:54;"So there's other bands on the more Xbox version,"
01:27:54;01:27:57;"but those bands are specifically on the Nintendo DS version."
01:27:57;01:28:00;"- And he was specific about which version he played?"
01:28:00;01:28:01;"- He was."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"- Not the bands."
01:28:02;01:28:03;"Just to be clear, not the bands."
01:28:03;01:28:07;"You just can clear about the Nintendo DS version."
01:28:07;01:28:08;"- Yes."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"I was thinking that that riff"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"kinda had like a Modest Mouse vibe or something."

01:28:23;01:28:24;"- I have no idea, dude."
01:28:24;01:28:27;"- I couldn't have told you that we were on Lego Rock Band."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"I know that we were on Just Dance 2"
01:28:29;01:28:32;"because that was like a really big one."
01:28:32;01:28:33;"And that's come up like a million times."

01:28:39;01:28:42;"See also, I feel like in this era,"
01:28:42;01:28:44;"when Guitar Hero came out,"
01:28:44;01:28:46;"there was a very specific songs on it."
01:28:46;01:28:50;"And you still can see sometimes if you look at like"
01:28:50;01:28:52;"streaming numbers or YouTube or something,"
01:28:52;01:28:55;"you can still see that there are specific songs"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"that were on Guitar Hero,"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"like Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones or something."
01:28:59;01:29:01;"Obviously that was already a big hit,"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"but it's like a whole new generation got into that song"
01:29:03;01:29:05;"specifically."
01:29:05;01:29:08;"Like I'm sure way more of the younger generation"

01:29:10;01:29:12;"let's spend the night together or something"
01:29:12;01:29:15;"because Paint It Black was on Guitar Hero."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"But I feel like later on there were expansion packs"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"and it like, I kind of remember people being like,"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"are you cool to be on like Guitar Hero?"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"I think eventually it wasn't like every song with a guitar"
01:29:24;01:29:27;"like available on all these platforms."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Wait Jake, have you ever played any of these games?"
01:29:29;01:29:33;"I think maybe once, like, was it out like 15 years ago?"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"Just about."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"2005 was when Guitar Hero started."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"Oh yeah, nailed it."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"15 years ago, yeah."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"I remember like a buddy of mine,"
01:29:41;01:29:43;"I think had it and it's like,"
01:29:43;01:29:46;"it was like a plastic guitar with like four keys on it,"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"right?"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"Yeah, and then you hold this like-"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Four like buttons?"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Yeah, four buttons and you hold this thing in the middle"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"that's like, you don't hold a pick,"
01:29:53;01:29:54;"but you hold this like,"
01:29:54;01:29:56;"just kind of like handle to go up and down like,"
01:29:56;01:29:57;"(imitates guitar)"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"And you're trying to like rhythmically"
01:29:59;01:30:02;"sink in with the song, right?"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"Yeah, 'cause the notes are like coming at you."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"So it's like two greens coming down like,"
01:30:05;01:30:08;"(imitates guitar)"
01:30:08;01:30:09;"Have you played a lot of it?"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"Yeah, I feel like when that was big,"
01:30:12;01:30:13;"we were like touring a lot."
01:30:13;01:30:16;"So I'd just be like hanging out in backstage areas"
01:30:16;01:30:19;"or I'm like in a van playing it."
01:30:19;01:30:20;"Yeah, I always liked Guitar Hero."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"I never really played rock band."
01:30:23;01:30:24;"What made it Lego rock band?"
01:30:24;01:30:26;"Just like, it looked like Legos?"

01:34:43;01:34:44;"you down to hang out with your friends tonight?"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"I'll drive you over to their house."

01:34:47;01:34:49;"Now you head to the club."
01:34:49;01:34:50;"And you're like, okay."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"And then I go over to Hannah's friend's house"
01:34:52;01:34:54;"and I'm like, hello, ladies."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"I've got a very interesting club night"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"I'd like to bring you to."

01:39:48;01:39:51;"Did he and like Fred Durst hate each other?"

01:40:09;01:40:11;"- Yeah, I feel like it was a thing where people"
01:40:11;01:40:13;"would like change their Twitter names to like"
01:40:13;01:40:15;"Santana featuring Rob Thomas,"
01:40:15;01:40:17;"like one of those really long."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"It was like kind of one of those."
01:40:18;01:40:20;"- The Grammy winning, yeah."
01:40:20;01:40:23;"Actually, you know, Brian Jones loves that song."

01:40:41;01:40:43;"(mimics riff)"
01:40:43;01:40:49;"And then you're like going to a solo."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"- I did find one beef, Steven Jenkins."
01:40:52;01:40:55;"I guess he's the lead singer of Third Eye Blind."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"- That makes sense."
01:40:56;01:40:59;"They're kind of jockeying for position."
01:40:59;01:41:00;"Yeah, contemporaries."
01:41:00;01:41:03;"- It seems like Third Eye, Steven Jenkins"
01:41:03;01:41:08;"made fun of Rob Thomas' weight gain at some point."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"- Oh, this is familiar on the show."
01:41:10;01:41:11;"- Not cool, man."
01:41:11;01:41:12;"All right, well, sorry, Jenkins."
01:41:12;01:41:14;"I don't know if there's any other evidence"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"that might make you look a little better,"
01:41:17;01:41:19;"but we're very influenced by the wisdom"
01:41:19;01:41:20;"of Jim Morrison on this show."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"And we just gotta say to you, you know,"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"what's so odious about being fat?"
01:41:25;01:41:29;"We're on Rob Thomas' team, and that's a real low blow."
01:41:29;01:41:32;"And, you know, Steven Jenkins and Third Eye Blind,"
01:41:32;01:41:33;"they were very successful as well,"
01:41:33;01:41:36;"but I'll tell you what Steven Jenkins never had."
01:41:36;01:41:37;"He never had a smooth."
01:41:37;01:41:41;"So I can imagine he's probably feeling a little bit salty,"
01:41:41;01:41:43;"and he wanted to come for Rob Thomas."
01:41:43;01:41:46;"And did Rob Thomas at least get a good zinger back at him?"
01:41:46;01:41:49;"- Yes, Thomas eventually fired back,"
01:41:49;01:41:52;"saying that Jenkins has, quote, ""No soul whatsoever."""
01:41:52;01:41:54;"(explosion)"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"- Damn, he went nuclear."
01:41:56;01:41:58;"(laughs)"
01:41:58;01:42:01;"I prefer the music of Third Eye Blind to Matchbox 20,"
01:42:01;01:42:04;"but I'm gonna side with Matchbox on this one."
01:42:04;01:42:08;"I wonder if Steven maybe reached out to Joe Walsh"
01:42:08;01:42:12;"and be like, ""Hey, man, let's do our own collab."""
01:42:12;01:42:15;"(laughs)"
01:42:15;01:42:15;"- Never."
01:42:15;01:42:17;"The label canceled it."
01:42:17;01:42:22;"He wanted to have his supernatural moment with Joe Walsh."
01:42:22;01:42:24;"The Joe Walsh record."
01:42:24;01:42:27;"- Joe Walsh featuring Steven Jenkins."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"(laughs)"
01:42:29;01:42:30;"Great idea."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"- The song's called ""Rough."""
01:42:32;01:42:37;"Also, I like Rob Thomas firing back that he has no soul,"
01:42:37;01:42:39;"because I assume because they're both musicians,"
01:42:39;01:42:42;"he meant the way musicians use soul,"
01:42:42;01:42:45;"like a particular kind of depth of character"
01:42:45;01:42:47;"in the way you perform or whatever."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"But I could also just picture him literally just being like,"

01:42:52;01:42:52;"""You're nothing."

01:43:01;01:43:04;"""You have no soul, even darker."""
01:43:04;01:43:07;"- Yeah, 'cause Rob's coming from this kind of bluesy,"
01:43:07;01:43:09;"kind of hard rock,"
01:43:09;01:43:11;"wear your heart on your sleeve kind of thing,"
01:43:11;01:43:14;"Steven's much more poppy and ironic."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"- Yeah, I wonder what their backgrounds are."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"- I don't want this art school crap."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"(laughs)"
01:43:19;01:43:21;"- Which one's the art school?"
01:43:21;01:43:23;"- It's Third Eye."
01:43:23;01:43:26;"Third Eye is like corporate indie."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"- Yeah, you know, in the late '90s,"

01:45:01;01:45:03;"and I remember one of his solo hits"
01:45:03;01:45:06;"got rewritten into a pop song years later."
01:45:06;01:45:09;"He's like really a talented songwriter"
01:45:09;01:45:12;"who's had some real durable hits,"
01:45:12;01:45:14;"some real contributions."
01:45:14;01:45:15;"And am I correct, Seinfeld,"
01:45:15;01:45:16;"that I feel like I've definitely been"
01:45:16;01:45:18;"on his Wikipedia page before?"
01:45:18;01:45:18;"Am I correct that he comes"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"from a hardscrabble background?"
01:45:20;01:45:22;"- It appears to be that way."
01:45:22;01:45:25;"I will say that he was born in West Germany"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"and then moved to Florida."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"- On a military base?"
01:45:29;01:45:32;"- Yes, he was born at, yes, that's right."
01:45:32;01:45:35;"His father was a US Army sergeant."
01:45:35;01:45:38;"- You'd be shocked how many notable Americans"
01:45:38;01:45:39;"were born in Germany."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"Like Martin Lawrence."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"- Wow. - All on military bases."
01:45:43;01:45:44;"- Interesting."
01:45:44;01:45:46;"Yeah, there's a whole paragraph,"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"his home life was not stable."
01:45:48;01:45:50;"I mean, I don't wanna air all his business out here,"
01:45:50;01:45:53;"but you're right, he definitely very hardscrabble."
01:45:53;01:45:55;"- And then one final question."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"Am I using the word hardscrabble correctly?"
01:45:57;01:45:59;"- I think we might have to ask Winter."
01:45:59;01:46:02;"That's a scrabble joke for you."
01:46:02;01:46:03;"- Good one."
01:46:03;01:46:08;"- Hardscrabble, involving hard work and struggle"
01:46:08;01:46:11;"is the definition of hardscrabble."
01:46:11;01:46:13;"So I think so, struggle."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"- Seems close enough."
01:46:15;01:46:20;"Okay, the next song, ""Pop Smoke for the Night"""
01:46:20;01:46:22;"featuring Lil Baby and DaBaby."
01:46:22;01:46:24;"- I think we heard this last time, right?"

01:47:31;01:47:32;"I guess they're all credited now,"
01:47:32;01:47:35;"but the Swiss producer claimed that a French producer"

01:48:06;01:48:07;"There's gotta be a DJ Venmo."
01:48:07;01:48:08;"- DJ Venmo."

01:48:11;01:48:15;"it could be like some type of pop star rapper."

01:50:51;01:50:54;"""I used to think that life was nothing without a partner,"
01:50:54;01:50:57;"""but we're here to introduce you to a new technique."

01:51:01;01:51:03;"trying to pursue a romantic relationship,"

01:51:05;01:51:08;"You list 10 hottest girls you can think of"
01:51:08;01:51:10;"and write down the quality of each of them that you like."

01:51:16;01:51:20;"- When you wake up, you will be pleasantly surprised to know"
01:51:20;01:51:23;"that you had a wet dream using our technique."
01:51:23;01:51:27;"And Cisco's like, ""Okay, maybe I'm not so incomplete."""
01:51:27;01:51:30;"- Is there like a VR component or technology, guys?"
01:51:30;01:51:32;"- No. - No."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"- No."
01:51:33;01:51:34;"Well, I'm thinking it's more like,"
01:51:34;01:51:38;"did you guys start watching this HBO documentary series"
01:51:38;01:51:42;"about NXIVM, which is what some people would call it cult,"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"but it started as being almost more like a kind of self-help"
01:51:45;01:51:49;"organization, and they had something called ESP,"
01:51:49;01:51:52;"the executive something program."
01:51:52;01:51:55;"When you hear them explain it, you would probably say,"
01:51:55;01:51:56;"""Well, there's elements of this"
01:51:56;01:51:58;"""that are reminiscent of Scientology."""
01:51:58;01:52:01;"But the framing of it was a little less kooky,"
01:52:01;01:52:04;"and there's a part in it where they're talking about"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"their charismatic founder,"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"who seemed to be a very smart person,"
01:52:07;01:52:12;"and he would present people this basically technique."
01:52:12;01:52:13;"It's kind of like a way of thinking,"
01:52:13;01:52:16;"almost like it looked like a flow chart or something"
01:52:16;01:52:19;"that would help people kind of move past trauma"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"and believe in themselves,"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"you know, all the usual self-help things."
01:52:23;01:52:26;"And there's a part in this first episode of the series,"
01:52:26;01:52:28;"which was pretty compelling,"
01:52:28;01:52:30;"where they showed this like flow chart looking thing,"
01:52:30;01:52:33;"and they're like, ""So, you know, our founder created this."
01:52:33;01:52:37;"""This was his proprietary way for people to, you know,"

01:53:01;01:53:02;"like, ""Is this some sort of technology?"""
01:53:02;01:53:04;"I can like totally picture like the O-Town guys"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"having a cult, where they're like,"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"""Oh no, it's a very powerful technology."""
01:53:08;01:53:12;"And he's like, ""So is it like, do I need like a CD-ROM"

01:53:26;01:53:26;"You know what I mean?"
01:53:26;01:53:30;"That's such a classic kind of like weird,"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"like corporate cult thing."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"It's like, this is technology."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"- Well, yeah, I feel like Hubbard referred"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"to Scientology as a technology."
01:53:38;01:53:39;"- Oh, really?"
01:53:39;01:53:41;"So maybe there's a long precedent for it of being like--"
01:53:41;01:53:45;"- There's definitely that term of like this system"
01:53:45;01:53:49;"of doing self-analysis with the E-meter and all that"
01:53:49;01:53:51;"is like a technology or like, you know, like--"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"(laughing)"
01:53:53;01:53:54;"I mean--"
01:53:54;01:53:55;"- I love that idea of just like--"
01:53:55;01:53:58;"- Thinking about different parts of different women."
01:53:58;01:53:59;"(laughing)"
01:53:59;01:54:01;"- That's a technology."
01:54:01;01:54:03;"- This is a technology."
01:54:03;01:54:04;"Like, it's just a good thing."
01:54:04;01:54:07;"So is this like a VR thing?"
01:54:07;01:54:07;"Do I throw it on?"
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Like, no, no, no."
01:54:09;01:54:12;"You're experiencing the technology as we speak."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Well, hold on."
01:54:13;01:54:16;"It just kind of seems like you guys just have an idea."
01:54:16;01:54:17;"What do you think technology is?"
01:54:17;01:54:19;"We have a trademark for this."
01:54:19;01:54:22;"We have a patent in the US Patent Office"
01:54:22;01:54:25;"that will tell you that this is a technology."
01:54:25;01:54:27;"- I will say that I could imagine there being"
01:54:27;01:54:31;"like an Alex Jones-style supplement involved in this"
01:54:31;01:54:34;"that would guarantee a more liquid dream"
01:54:34;01:54:38;"or something like that that you take right before bed."
01:54:38;01:54:41;"- But it's really just like some kind of like store-bought"
01:54:41;01:54:43;"like potassium supplement."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"- Oh yeah, it's a placebo."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"- Where you just like change--"
01:54:46;01:54:48;"Well, yeah, it's basically just like vitamin D."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- It's vitamin D."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"It's vitamin D."
01:54:50;01:54:52;"(laughing)"
01:54:52;01:54:53;"- It's vitamin D."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"I could also like picture to like,"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"if we ever take time crisis on the road"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"and we have to like, you know,"
01:54:58;01:55:03;"create like an opening introduction or something,"
01:55:03;01:55:05;"it would definitely be like the video we play"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"would just be like kind of infomercial"

01:55:10;01:55:12;"It's a very powerful technology."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"And you know what?"
01:55:13;01:55:16;"It doesn't involve fancy VR goggles or CD-ROMs,"
01:55:16;01:55:18;"but time crisis is a way of thinking"
01:55:18;01:55:20;"that will change your life"
01:55:20;01:55:24;"more than any high-pollutant computer technology."
01:55:24;01:55:26;"This is a powerful ancient--"
01:55:26;01:55:28;"I think that's another like weird kind of spammer thing"
01:55:28;01:55:30;"is like ancient technology."
01:55:30;01:55:31;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:55:31;01:55:33;"- Time crisis is an ancient technology."

01:56:13;01:56:14;"- Wow."
01:56:14;01:56:17;"- It's really more that than like computer technology,"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"like digital technology that we sort of associate"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"the word with."
01:56:21;01:56:22;"- Yeah, okay, you know what?"
01:56:22;01:56:25;"I'm sorry that we were hard on, you know,"
01:56:25;01:56:27;"any of these quotes because-- - On O-Town."

01:56:32;01:56:34;"Oh man, I could also picture that,"
01:56:34;01:56:36;"just like a brutal like tech talk."
01:56:36;01:56:40;"I'm like giving a TED Talk one day"
01:56:40;01:56:42;"and I'm just like trying to like win over"
01:56:42;01:56:44;"some Silicon Valley people and I'm just like,"
01:56:44;01:56:46;"now you guys probably think,"
01:56:46;01:56:48;"I'm an American musician radio personality"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"and you guys work in tech."
01:56:50;01:56:52;"What do I have to tell you guys?"
01:56:52;01:56:54;"Well, guess what people?"
01:56:54;01:56:55;"I work in tech too."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"I've created my own technology."
01:56:57;01:56:59;"I actually work in ancient technology."
01:56:59;01:57:01;"Let me break this down for you"
01:57:01;01:57:03;"and just have this like weird,"
01:57:03;01:57:05;"like self-aggrandizing thing about like,"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"now you guys use coding to create your technology."
01:57:08;01:57:12;"Me, I use a pen and paper and my vocal cords."
01:57:12;01:57:15;"But what we're accomplishing is the exact same thing."
01:57:15;01:57:16;"Technology."
01:57:16;01:57:20;"All right, number two song 2020,"

01:58:27;01:58:29;"- Each individual song is technology."
01:58:29;01:58:32;"An album is a super technology."
01:58:33;01:58:34;"- Drake just dropped,"
01:58:34;01:58:35;"(laughing)"
01:58:35;01:58:37;"Drake released new technology."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"(laughing)"
01:58:39;01:58:42;"- That really does sound like some musician"
01:58:42;01:58:44;"who fully flips their lid."
01:58:44;01:58:44;"- And he's like-"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"- Full Kanye."
01:58:46;01:58:48;"(laughing)"
01:58:48;01:58:51;"- Well."
01:58:51;01:58:53;"- Oh, I mean, you can see him being like,"
01:58:53;01:58:55;"I got this new technology."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"- I can see Kanye referring to music as technology."
01:58:57;01:58:59;"In fact, it wouldn't shock me a furty head."
01:58:59;01:59:01;"But I'm talking about somebody who goes so buck wild"
01:59:01;01:59:03;"that they're just like in it."
01:59:03;01:59:04;"(laughing)"
01:59:04;01:59:08;"The person's like, so on your new song, technology."
01:59:08;01:59:10;"Oh, the song is called technology?"
01:59:10;01:59:12;"No, no, the song is technology."
01:59:12;01:59:13;"I'm a little bit confused here."
01:59:13;01:59:16;"Please do not refer to my technology as songs."
01:59:16;01:59:20;"That's a diminutive and that's demeaning to my technology."
01:59:20;01:59:21;"Okay."
01:59:21;01:59:24;"Just absolutely refusing to call it anything."
01:59:24;01:59:26;"Also, I love the idea that tech,"
01:59:26;01:59:29;"I think I'm kind of getting the vibe off of"
01:59:29;01:59:32;"that very big first definition of technology,"
01:59:32;01:59:35;"that almost anything in the world could be technology."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"Like you could probably treat it-"
01:59:36;01:59:38;"- Yeah, like a recipe in a cookbook could be technology."
01:59:38;01:59:39;"I mean, it could be, yeah."
01:59:39;01:59:41;"- It's all technology, baby."
01:59:41;01:59:44;"- Have I ever made you guacamole before?"
01:59:44;01:59:49;"'Cause I mean, my guacamole technology is unstoppable."
01:59:49;01:59:51;"- Oh man, I could totally picture that."
01:59:51;01:59:55;"Like Jake in like, we should make a fake YouTube ad"
01:59:55;01:59:56;"that's Jake being like an entrepreneur."
01:59:56;01:59:59;"That's like, hey, what's up?"
01:59:59;02:00:02;"I bet you're probably about to click skip ad."
02:00:02;02:00:03;"Hold on a second."
02:00:03;02:00:06;"What if I told you that right now in Silicon Valley,"
02:00:06;02:00:10;"there's a lot of people making butt loads of money"
02:00:10;02:00:11;"working in tech."
02:00:11;02:00:13;"And you said, well, what does that have to do with me?"
02:00:13;02:00:15;"I don't live in Silicon Valley."
02:00:15;02:00:16;"I don't know how to code."
02:00:16;02:00:18;"I don't know the first thing about technology."
02:00:18;02:00:20;"Well, hold on a second."
02:00:20;02:00:22;"And then like custom Jake's in the kitchen."
02:00:22;02:00:23;"Have you ever made guacamole?"
02:00:23;02:00:26;"(both laughing)"
02:00:28;02:00:30;"Even what you're doing right now, watching me,"
02:00:30;02:00:31;"is technology."
02:00:31;02:00:34;"We are engaged in a technological conversation."
02:00:34;02:00:38;"And I want you to know that you can make billions"
02:00:38;02:00:39;"off your own tech."
02:00:39;02:00:42;"- Guacamole technology, LTV."
02:00:42;02:00:44;"- I patented technology will help you understand"
02:00:44;02:00:47;"that everything you do is technology."
02:00:47;02:00:49;"Why should the Silicon Valley fat cats take all the money"
02:00:49;02:00:52;"when you're performing technology every single day?"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"- Smash cuts to my initial public offering"
02:00:54;02:00:56;"of guacamole technology."
02:00:56;02:00:58;"(both laughing)"
02:00:58;02:01:00;"Set records that day in Wall Street."
02:01:00;02:01:02;"- I love that there's some sort of an underlying,"
02:01:02;02:01:04;"like, what's the word?"
02:01:04;02:01:07;"Like co-opting, like a little bit of a problematic"
02:01:07;02:01:11;"about Jake disrupting guacamole"
02:01:11;02:01:16;"and reframing it as technology."
02:01:16;02:01:17;"- Yeah."
02:01:17;02:01:19;"It's totally cool."
02:01:19;02:01:23;"- Jake gets called out for people being like,"
02:01:23;02:01:25;"how can you claim that you invented guacamole?"
02:01:25;02:01:29;"Obviously this dish comes from Mexico."
02:01:29;02:01:31;"And then Jake does like kind of like mea culpa video."
02:01:31;02:01:35;"He's like, okay, I messed up to some extent."
02:01:35;02:01:40;"When I make guacamole, I am creating original technology."
02:01:40;02:01:43;"However, I never said that my technology"
02:01:43;02:01:45;"was not based on the ancient technology"
02:01:45;02:01:47;"of the people of Mexico."
02:01:47;02:01:51;"- Ancient guacamole technology."
02:01:51;02:01:53;"(both laughing)"
02:01:54;02:01:56;"- Jake is like real pedantic."
02:01:56;02:01:58;"Just like, I see the confusion,"
02:01:58;02:02:00;"but what you are referring to is ancient technology."
02:02:00;02:02:02;"- Guacamole is just your palate."
02:02:02;02:02:06;"What you decided to do with that raw material,"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"that's your IP."
02:02:08;02:02:09;"- Precisely."
02:02:09;02:02:11;"The video of Jake standing in front"
02:02:11;02:02:13;"of a guacamole green Ferrari."
02:02:13;02:02:15;"He's like, hey, I see you."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"You're about to skip this ad."
02:02:16;02:02:19;"But I bet you're wondering how a guy like me"
02:02:19;02:02:21;"ended up with a guacamole green Ferrari."
02:02:21;02:02:23;"(both laughing)"
02:02:23;02:02:26;"And everybody's like, all right, yeah, I wanna know."
02:02:26;02:02:27;"What's your story, dude?"
02:02:27;02:02:30;"And he's like, one word, technology."
02:02:30;02:02:33;"Those videos are always like 45 minutes long"
02:02:33;02:02:35;"if you don't skip the ad."
02:02:35;02:02:38;"(both laughing)"
02:02:38;02:02:40;"I feel like there's one I used to always see."
02:02:40;02:02:42;"It was like a bodybuilder,"
02:02:42;02:02:45;"just like slamming like pancakes into your (beep)"
02:02:45;02:02:48;"and just basically being like, hey, what's up?"
02:02:48;02:02:50;"Have you guys been on (beep) diets"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"that made you (beep) hungry all the time?"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"Well, guess what? I eat whatever the (beep) I want."
02:02:54;02:02:55;"(both laughing)"
02:02:55;02:02:57;"I was like that being an element of Jake's thing."
02:02:57;02:03:00;"Just like, I drive a guacamole green Ferrari"
02:03:00;02:03:03;"and I eat whatever the (beep) I want."
02:03:03;02:03:05;"You still wanna skip this ad?"
02:03:05;02:03:06;"Nah, come with me."
