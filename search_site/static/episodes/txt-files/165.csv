00:00;00:13;"Thurston Moore, John Mayer, Jerry Garcia, Bono, X-Ray Spex, Blondie."
00:13;00:21;"This is a very special episode of our program. We talk jam bands, noise music,"
00:21;00:29;"and so much more on Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
30:59;31:04;"Seinfeld, can you reach out to Trey Anastasiou and Thurston Moore and see if they'll be down to talk about pedals?"
31:04;31:08;"We won't bring up the controversial interview, but we just want to talk about pedals."
31:08;31:09;"Sure."
31:09;31:10;"Thank you."
36:30;36:33;"It is pretty dead. The lyrics are pretty dead."
36:33;36:34;"Totally."
36:57;37:00;"This sounds so much like pavement."
37:00;37:01;"Oh, totally."
37:01;37:08;"But I don't remember, is this unique to a Sonic Youth song?"
37:08;37:12;"It's maybe a little more spare than a lot of their stuff."
37:12;37:16;"It's so funny hearing this song and just thinking that there's somewheres like,"
37:16;37:20;"""We'll give fish our audience, but we're not going to get any of it."""
37:20;37:21;"I think it's..."
37:21;37:23;"[Laughter]"
37:23;37:25;"They do nothing for us."
37:41;37:44;"Thurston was picturing a Fish fan who would hear this and be like,"
37:44;37:46;"""My mind is f***ing blown."""
37:46;37:49;"But see, keep in mind, for the Deadhead, they're like,"
37:49;37:51;"""All right, now you're going to prove yourself."""
37:51;37:52;"Okay, let's go."
37:52;37:53;"I like the song."
37:53;37:57;"All right."
37:57;37:59;"Waiting for the solo to start."
38:13;38:15;"We're just getting warmed up still."
38:15;38:16;"Right."
38:16;38:17;"They're just kind of vamping still."
38:17;38:20;"No, for the Deadhead, the solo hasn't started yet."
38:20;38:22;"Yeah, we're waiting for it."
38:22;38:25;"In Thurston's mind, he's been soloing for 30 seconds."
38:33;38:34;"Okay."
38:34;38:35;"Ooh."
38:53;38:54;"Textural."
38:57;39:00;"Deadhead's starting to kind of fade on this a little bit maybe."
39:00;39:03;"Deadhead's like, ""I might go get another beer."""
39:03;39:04;"Yeah."
39:10;39:13;"There hasn't been a single run yet, you know?"
39:13;39:14;"Yeah."
39:21;39:24;"I mean, I would love to hear the Dead cover this song."
39:24;39:26;"I think that would be fascinating."
39:26;39:29;"Maybe Richard Pictures should cover this."
39:29;39:30;"That's tight."
39:41;39:44;"I'm going to say something controversial because, again, I like Sonic Youth a lot,"
39:44;39:45;"and I like this song."
39:45;39:49;"But actually, I feel like a lot of people who hate jam band music"
39:49;39:52;"think jam band music sounds like this."
39:52;39:54;"You know what I mean?"
39:54;39:55;"Totally."
39:55;39:57;"Like a little aimless."
39:57;39:58;"Yeah."
39:58;40:00;"Where's the focus here?"
40:00;40:02;"When people are being mean about jamming, they always say,"
40:02;40:06;"""I don't want to listen to a bunch of stoners [beep] around on guitar."""
40:06;40:10;"Whereas if you actually listen to Jerry, you're like, ""Well, [beep] around."""
40:10;40:15;"At worst, it's like watching Michael Jordan just kind of shoot around at the court."
40:15;40:18;"There's still going to be a lot of artistry there."
40:20;40:21;"Oh."
40:21;40:23;"We haven't got a single run yet."
40:52;40:55;"Wrong Warlocks, Thurston."
40:55;40:57;"It's the wrong Warlocks, man."
40:57;40:59;"Oh, I dig it, man."
40:59;41:01;"So they're doing kind of a drone thing on this thing,"
41:01;41:03;"but the next song is going to be--"
41:03;41:05;"they're going to bust out their Scarlet style."
41:05;41:07;"I think maybe the thing that Thurston also doesn't understand"
41:07;41:10;"is that this is reminiscent of The Grateful Dead."
41:10;41:18;"It's reminiscent of space, which is one of the less cherished parts."
41:18;41:20;"There's no Dead fan who said,"
41:20;41:23;"""I wish that they would just do three hours of space."""
41:23;41:24;"I mean, there might be."
41:24;41:26;"It would be an unpopular opinion."
41:26;41:27;"Yeah."
41:31;41:34;"[Applause]"
42:32;42:50;"I like this song, and actually, I do feel--"
42:50;42:53;"I like when Sonic Youth gets noisy and droney."
42:53;42:55;"It's just, you know, at the end of the day,"
42:55;42:57;"Sonic Youth is Sonic Youth."
42:57;42:59;"They're not a jam band."
43:02;43:08;"They slowed down a lot."
43:08;43:09;"Yes."
43:09;43:15;"Well, yeah, no, I love this."
43:15;43:18;"I just love picturing the Fish fan or the Dead fan being like,"
43:18;43:20;"""Okay, well, the next song is going to be up."""
43:20;43:22;"And this is like, ""Nope."""
43:22;43:26;"I actually remember that Sonic Youth show,"
43:26;43:28;"at Lollapalooza,"
43:28;43:30;"I've seen that a few times."
43:30;43:34;"And the last 35 minutes was just a wall of noise."
43:34;43:38;"Like, on the main stage at night."
43:38;43:42;"Just like, after seeing Cypress Hill and stuff."
43:42;43:44;"[Laughter]"
43:44;43:46;"I think Hole played."
43:46;43:48;"I think Sonic Youth maybe closed the night."
43:48;43:50;"I don't remember really."
43:50;43:54;"But it was like, definitely saw Cypress Hill and Hole"
43:54;43:56;"on the big stage."
43:56;43:59;"And then it was just like, deep night time at this point."
43:59;44:01;"And it's just like, 35 minutes of just..."
44:01;44:03;"[Snoring]"
44:03;44:06;"It's just like, damn, man."
44:06;44:08;"Not tight."
44:08;44:11;"At the end of the day, there's always going to be..."
44:11;44:13;"Sonic Youth is..."
44:13;44:15;"They get into noise music, you know,"
44:15;44:17;"which is just like, is cool."
44:17;44:20;"And actually, I think noise music is a beautiful tradition."
44:20;44:22;"You know, I grew up in New Jersey."
44:22;44:24;"I've seen noise music shows in New Brunswick."
44:24;44:26;"I've checked out the Rutgers noise scene."
44:26;44:29;"And there is something tight about you going to a basement."
44:29;44:32;"Just like, a bunch of people sitting on the floor"
44:32;44:36;"with like, pedals and just making crazy weird sounds."
44:36;44:38;"It is cool."
44:38;44:40;"Drinking like, a room temperature PBR and it's just like,"
44:40;44:42;"so loud."
44:42;44:43;"Yeah."
44:43;44:45;"Yeah, no, you could definitely go deaf."
44:45;44:47;"I mean, god."
44:47;44:49;"You need earplugs."
44:49;44:51;"There's definitely some people with long-term hearing damage"
44:51;44:54;"from going to one basement noise show in New Brunswick."
44:54;45:10;"I would go to noise shows and stand outside the noise show."
45:10;45:13;"Okay, so you would kind of just hear it through the basement walls?"
45:13;45:16;"Yeah, because I would walk in for like, 40 seconds"
45:16;45:18;"and there would be like, four people."
45:18;45:21;"So, you would have like, 15 people kind of milling outside the noise show."
45:21;45:23;"Then you walk in and it's so loud."
45:23;45:25;"And there's like, four people actually in."
45:25;45:27;"Yeah."
45:27;45:29;"In the room or the basement."
45:29;45:31;"Which is kind of amazing performance art."
45:31;45:34;"Like, I wonder if there ever was somebody who truly,"
45:34;45:38;"I mean, who truly was like, into noise music and the dead."
45:38;45:41;"And like, was doing just like, a basement noise show"
45:41;45:43;"in like, Bloomington, Indiana or something."
45:43;45:45;"And just like, the first 15 minutes was like,"
45:45;45:47;"[mimics noise]"
45:47;45:49;"Just like, crazy feedback."
45:49;45:52;"And then, it kind of got quiet and crescendoed."
45:52;45:54;"And then got quiet again."
45:54;45:56;"And then just, they pulled out a guitar."
45:56;46:00;"And then just did like, just like a perfect like, Scarlet solo."
46:00;46:03;"I mean, my buddy Adam Forkner would do stuff like that."
46:03;46:05;"He had a band called White Rainbow."
46:05;46:07;"And he would marry that."
46:07;46:09;"He would marry the tendencies."
46:09;46:11;"I would be waiting for the solo."
46:11;46:12;"And I'd be the only one."
46:12;46:13;"And he'd be like, ""Dude, I'm doing this for you"
46:13;46:15;"because you'd love these solos."""
46:15;46:16;"Because it would be like, sort of like..."
46:16;46:18;"A melodic solo."
46:18;46:20;"Yeah. Oh yeah. Beautiful."
46:20;46:22;"And everyone else thought it was kind of funny."
46:22;46:25;"And I was like, ""Forkner, that's the best part of the show, the solos."""
46:45;46:47;"It's as old as time itself."
46:47;46:49;"Is this... I can relate to both things."
46:49;46:51;"And I'm sure we all can as artists."
46:51;46:54;"There's the person who woodsheds"
46:54;46:58;"and develops like, the crazy technical ability."
46:58;47:01;"And they work their ass off so that they can just like..."
47:01;47:04;"You know, if it was painting, paint photo realistic,"
47:04;47:07;"like perfect images."
47:07;47:10;"If it's in music, there's the person who can solo"
47:10;47:14;"in any mode, any key, any style."
47:14;47:16;"They can tell a story that way."
47:16;47:18;"And then you're going to have the other people who are just like,"
47:18;47:23;"""What I care about is texture and vibe and coolness."""
47:23;47:27;"And yeah, all those years you spent like learning all the modes,"
47:27;47:29;"I don't give a s***."
47:29;47:31;"It doesn't have passion."
47:31;47:33;"And when I f*** plug in and..."
47:33;47:35;"That's transcendent."
47:35;47:37;"And you know, you can understand both sides of it."
47:37;47:39;"You know, the Thurston's are just like,"
47:39;47:42;"""Oh God, who gives a s*** that you can like, you know,"
47:42;47:44;"do a solo where you like,"
47:44;47:46;"sound like you're playing country and then the next minute"
47:46;47:48;"you sound like you're, you know, Ted Nugent."""
47:48;47:50;"Like, who gives a s***? That's not cool to me."
47:50;47:52;"And then, you know, from that point of view,"
47:52;47:55;"they might be like, ""Yeah, but you're a hater."
47:55;47:57;"You can't even do it, man."
47:57;47:59;"You don't know your fundamentals."""
47:59;48:02;"And frankly, what you do, I could do what you do."
48:02;48:04;"My kid could do that, man."
48:04;48:07;"These are classic tendencies that are at war with each other."
48:07;48:09;"My kid could do that."
48:29;48:31;"I like this part of the song."
48:31;48:34;"Minute nine of Diamond Sea? My kid could do that."
48:34;48:36;"How far into the song are we?"
48:36;48:38;"Yeah."
48:38;48:40;"Thirteen and a half minutes."
48:40;48:43;"Okay. I believe in this song is seventeen minutes?"
48:43;48:45;"I think it's twenty."
48:45;48:48;"[Laughter]"
48:48;48:50;"Nineteen and a half."
48:50;48:51;"Whoa."
48:51;48:53;"Okay, cool. We got six minutes left."
48:53;48:55;"They're just different things, man."
48:55;48:57;"They're just different things."
49:05;49:07;"I think Trey's a very nice guy, so I don't think he would have"
49:07;49:09;"any harsh words, but I imagine if Trey was listening to this,"
49:09;49:14;"he'd be like, ""This is cool. However, I could do this in a second."
49:14;49:16;"I could call up the boys."
49:16;49:19;"We could do a better version of this with Page doing some"
49:19;49:21;"interesting synth work."
49:21;49:23;"We could do a better version than this."
49:23;49:26;"Literally, you want us to do a song like this?"
49:26;49:29;"All we need is twenty minutes. We could do it."
49:29;49:34;"However, Hansonic Youth, Helly's comment, a simple one."
49:34;49:36;"They wouldn't even know what to do with it."
49:36;49:40;"I mean, POV, this idea that you have something to offer me"
49:40;49:44;"and I have nothing to offer you, you got it backwards, buddy."
49:44;49:46;"Yeah, and then Thurston would be like, ""Well, you couldn't write"
49:46;49:48;"the pavement part."""
49:48;49:49;"[Laughter]"
49:49;49:51;"That's really funny when you think about it."
49:51;49:53;"You couldn't write the part?"
49:53;49:55;"This is an actual dialogue where Trey's just like,"
49:55;49:57;"""I could do all that feedback s***. We do that."
49:57;50:00;"We do that all the time, but you couldn't do what I do."
50:00;50:02;"You couldn't rip melodic solos."""
50:02;50:05;"And then Thurston goes, ""But you couldn't write the pavement part."""
50:05;50:08;"And then Trey's like, ""Man, you hear what you just said?"
50:08;50:11;"I couldn't write the pavement part. You're not in pavement, man."
50:11;50:14;"You're in Sonic Youth. Case closed, buddy."""
50:43;51:08;"[Applause]"
51:08;51:10;"The thing that always bummed me out about the song is"
51:10;51:12;"that sound in the beginning."
51:12;51:14;"[Sings melody]"
51:14;51:21;"If around now, Thurston just busted out a melodic solo with that sound."
51:21;51:26;"[Sings melody]"
51:26;51:29;"I wonder if that's Lee Rinaldo doing that part or if it's Sonic."
51:29;51:31;"Oh, that could be Lee Rinaldo."
51:31;51:33;"You know who really needs to weigh in is Lee Rinaldo"
51:33;51:35;"because he actually was a Grateful Dead fan growing up."
51:35;51:39;"I wonder if he read this Index magazine interview"
51:39;51:41;"and later he just said to Thurston, he's like,"
51:41;51:44;"""You know what? Cool it with that s***, man."""
51:44;51:47;"The deadhead in him suddenly got a little bit offended."
51:47;51:49;"He was just like, ""Dude."""
51:49;51:51;"Bro, come on. Stay in your lane."
51:51;51:53;"Bro, it's different tendencies, man."
51:53;51:55;"Different warlocks."
52:09;52:14;"It really is profound that the Velvets and the Dead were both called the warlocks."
52:14;52:17;"You know what that is, man? That's called the glitch in the Matrix."
52:17;52:22;"Yeah, there's something there that's very cosmic and heavy."
52:22;52:25;"I was reading about the new Matrix film."
52:25;52:27;"Yeah, I watched it."
52:27;52:29;"I watched most of it."
52:29;52:32;"It had some moments, but you know how they use--"
52:32;52:35;"This might be the hardest to listen to TC ever."
52:35;52:39;"Just us talking over the noisiest part of the Diamond Sea."
52:39;52:40;"[Mimics sound]"
52:40;52:45;"But I guess the Wachowskis, the writing/directing team,"
52:45;52:50;"they used White Rabbit not only because it's this psychedelic song"
52:50;52:54;"referencing Alice in Wonderland and entering a new world,"
52:54;52:58;"which is very Matrix, but also because one of the--"
52:58;52:59;"I didn't know this."
52:59;53:03;"One of the big hippie clubs in San Francisco in the '60s"
53:03;53:06;"where the Jefferson Airplane used to play was called the Matrix."
53:06;53:07;"Oh, wow."
53:07;53:09;"Seinfeld, can you do a number crunch?"
53:09;53:14;"The Grateful Dead must have played at the Matrix in SF in the '60s."
53:14;53:16;"We could be onto something."
53:16;53:19;"There were two warlocks. There was a club called the Matrix."
53:19;53:21;"That was a glitch in the Matrix."
53:21;53:23;"There was only supposed to be one warlock."
53:23;53:26;"The programmer was only meant to do one warlock,"
53:26;53:30;"and they were going to marry the tendencies of the Grateful Dead"
53:30;53:34;"and the Velvet Underground, but there was a glitch, and it got doubled."
53:34;53:36;"And then we ended up with two warlocks."
53:36;53:38;"The results are in."
53:38;53:43;"The Grateful Dead did play the Matrix December 1, 1966."
53:43;53:45;"Early, early days."
53:45;53:48;"Did the Velvet Underground ever play the Matrix?"
53:48;53:49;"No."
53:49;53:51;"Time takes its crazy toll."
53:51;53:53;"I got the results."
53:53;53:56;"The Velvet Underground did play the Matrix."
53:56;53:58;"Oh, my God. This is getting spooky."
53:58;54:01;"Looks like-- You know what?"
54:01;54:03;"Give me a sec. Give me a sec here."
54:03;54:05;"Standing by."
54:05;54:16;"I hate to be a backseat driver,"
54:16;54:19;"but I just also think it would have been a little more jammed"
54:19;54:22;"if during the noisy part it started to get like--"
54:22;54:26;"[imitates car noises]"
54:26;54:30;"Time takes its crazy toll."
54:30;54:32;"Some dynamics, right?"
54:32;54:34;"Yeah, it came back in with the--"
54:34;54:35;"The results are in."
54:35;54:40;"The Velvet Underground played the Matrix December 26 and 27, 1969."
54:40;54:43;"They actually released an album, a live album,"
54:43;54:45;"called The Complete Matrix Tapes."
54:45;54:48;"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
54:48;54:50;"This is too freaky."
54:50;54:52;"There were two bands called The Warlocks."
54:52;54:55;"One became The Grateful Dead, one became The Velvet Underground,"
54:55;54:58;"and they both played at a club in San Francisco in the 1960s"
54:58;55:00;"called The Matrix."
55:00;55:03;"Wait, do all the Matrix movies take place in San Francisco?"
55:03;55:05;"No, I think it's like a generic city, right?"
55:05;55:07;"Like a Gotham? Or I don't know."
55:07;55:08;"I'm not a Matrix fan."
55:08;55:09;"You're right."
55:09;55:14;"They do take place in an invented metropolis known as Mega City."
55:14;55:16;"Oh, all right. Good call, Jake."
55:16;55:17;"Mega City."
55:17;55:18;"Inventive."
55:18;55:20;"Yeah, that's heavy, man."
55:20;55:24;"Okay, but again, to go back to our imaginary hippie,"
55:24;55:26;"I'm not saying the hippie would have hated it."
55:26;55:28;"I'm not saying the Deadhead would have hated it,"
55:28;55:30;"because again, all I'm taking issue with"
55:30;55:32;"is some of what Thurston said in this interview."
55:32;55:35;"I'm definitely not taking issue with his artistry."
55:35;55:40;"But again, this Deadhead in mourning, late '95,"
55:40;55:41;"listens to Diamond Sea."
55:41;55:42;"They're just going to say--"
55:42;55:44;"I mean, there are elements of that that reminded me"
55:44;55:46;"of a kind of a harsh space,"
55:46;55:49;"but I'm not getting Dead vibes off of it."
55:49;55:50;"I was waiting."
55:50;55:54;"I waited 20 minutes for a melodic narrative solo,"
55:54;55:55;"and I didn't get it."
55:55;55:57;"Yeah, it's going to be fish."
55:57;55:58;"Wait, wait, wait. Hold up."
55:58;56:02;"One of the filming locations of The Matrix was San Francisco."
56:02;56:04;"I mean, it's so freaky."
56:04;56:06;"Can you imagine that we actually proved"
56:06;56:08;"that we live in a simulation"
56:08;56:11;"by reading a 1998 Thurston Moore interview"
56:11;56:13;"about the band Phish?"
56:13;56:14;"I just realized something."
56:14;56:17;"The Matrix first movie came out in '99."
56:17;56:20;"If you turn '99 upside down, it's '66."
56:20;56:22;"Whoa, freaky."
56:22;56:24;"This is a real lid blower."
56:24;56:25;"And actually, when you think about it,"
56:25;56:29;"it probably took them a few years to write the movie."
56:29;56:30;"Nick, you work in show biz."
56:30;56:32;"If a movie comes out in '99,"
56:32;56:34;"you're working on that minimum."
56:34;56:37;"You're starting work minimum '96, right?"
56:37;56:38;"Minimum."
56:38;56:41;"I mean, with the amount of drafts that would take place,"
56:41;56:43;"I mean, those writers could be working on it"
56:43;56:45;"for significantly longer."
56:45;56:46;"And you got to do--"
56:46;56:48;"You're thinking maybe they started--"
56:48;56:51;"The first seeds of an idea of The Matrix started on--"
56:51;56:53;"August 9th."
56:53;56:54;"August 9th."
56:54;56:56;"August 9th, '95."
56:56;56:58;"The day after Jerry died."
56:58;57:01;"Because they literally could not have opened"
57:01;57:03;"that can of worms"
57:03;57:06;"while Jerry was still manifested in this reality."
57:06;57:11;"Frankly, I could see one of the Wachowski sisters."
57:11;57:13;"How do you say that pronounced?"
57:13;57:14;"I think it's Wachowski."
57:14;57:17;"They were just sort of like taking a nap"
57:17;57:19;"or maybe eating lunch."
57:19;57:21;"And Jerry dies, and they're like,"
57:21;57:22;"""Oh, I have an idea."""
57:22;57:24;"You know, sort of one of those not knowing."
57:24;57:26;"You know, just sort of cosmic."
57:26;57:28;"Yeah, woke up and it's like kind of on the--"
57:28;57:30;"I just have the craziest idea for a movie."
57:30;57:33;"Wait, what was the name of that club in SF"
57:33;57:34;"in the late '60s?"
57:34;57:37;"I think The Dead played there and The Velvet Underground."
57:37;57:38;"Oh, The Matrix."
57:38;57:41;"I was just thinking about that club."
57:41;57:44;"I heard some good live Velvet Underground from there."
57:44;57:46;"Whoa, yeah, that's funny."
57:46;57:48;"By the way, did you hear Jerry Garcia died?"
57:48;57:49;"What?"
57:49;57:50;"Uh, no."
57:50;57:52;"I was just taking a nap."
57:52;57:53;"Okay."
57:53;57:55;"Anyway, four years later, you leave The Matrix."
57:55;57:56;"Yeah."
57:56;58:00;"Lana Wachowski, birth year 1965."
58:00;58:04;"Lily Wachowski, birth year 1967."
58:04;58:07;"The two years bookending 1966."
58:07;58:08;"The years between."
58:08;58:10;"The year between."
58:10;58:13;"1966 is the year between for the Wachowskis."
58:13;58:16;"Mac, you throwing White Rabbit?"
58:16;58:19;"Underneath the whole conversation?"
58:19;58:22;"Dude, one pill makes you smaller."
58:22;58:24;"I mean, yeah, truly."
58:24;58:26;"One pill makes you tall."
58:33;58:36;"It is funny to think about the way that all this media flows,"
58:36;58:39;"because obviously Alice in Wonderland was originally a book"
58:39;58:42;"from the 19th century written by Lewis Carroll,"
58:42;58:44;"who's also a mathematician."
58:44;58:46;"Kind of freaky."
58:46;58:48;"I actually read reading about this song,"
58:48;58:51;"Grace said something like, ""Yeah, how'd you come up with this song?"""
58:51;58:55;"She's like, ""Did acid, listened to Sketches of Spain by Miles Davis"
58:55;58:58;"and wrote a song about Alice in Wonderland."""
58:58;59:02;"One pill makes you small."
59:02;59:05;"I can hear the Sketches of Spain, that drum pattern."
59:05;59:08;"Oh, yeah, totally. So Sketches of Spain."
59:08;59:10;"The Dead love Sketches of Spain, too."
59:10;59:13;"They used to have a jam called Spanish Jam."
59:13;59:14;"Oh, yeah."
59:14;59:16;"Was that in reference to Sketches of Spain?"
59:16;59:17;"Yeah."
59:17;59:19;"They're riffing on--"
59:26;59:29;"I love this song. It's so freaky."
59:29;59:31;"It's such a good vibe."
59:31;59:33;"I don't know if the CIA wrote this song or what,"
59:33;59:37;"but can you picture a more perfect big hit to drop"
59:37;59:40;"at the peak of summer of love drug culture?"
59:40;59:44;"It's like this mystical doors opening song"
59:44;59:48;"that ends with somebody yelling, ""Feed your head!"""
59:48;59:49;"[laughs]"
59:49;59:53;"Music doesn't meet the moment like that very often."
59:58;01:00:01;"Kind of mushroom."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"This song goes hard, man. It keeps building."
01:00:12;01:00:13;"Yeah."
01:00:13;01:00:16;"Honestly, that's why I got so hyped about the new Matrix."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"When I saw the trailer and they were just kind of jamming this,"
01:00:19;01:00:22;"I was like, ""All right, I got to watch this."""
01:00:22;01:00:25;"I love when she's like, ""When logic and proportion--"""
01:00:25;01:00:26;"Yeah."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"[laughs]"
01:00:45;01:00:48;"How high did this song get in the charts, Seinfeld?"
01:00:48;01:00:52;"Looks like this peaked at 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"Oh."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"1967."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Oh, it didn't get higher?"
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I guess ""Somebody to Love"" maybe was the biggest song."
01:00:58;01:00:59;"Oh, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"My bad, my bad. It peaked at number eight."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"I'm looking at a year-end chart."
01:01:02;01:01:03;"That's amazing."
01:01:03;01:01:05;"It peaked at number eight in 1967."
01:01:05;01:01:06;"Top ten."
01:01:06;01:01:07;"Yeah."
01:01:07;01:01:08;"Yeah, it's very short."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"It also peaked at number one in Canada."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"Okay, Canadian number one."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"Yeah."
01:01:13;01:01:17;"Can you imagine just being a young person in Canada in the late '60s?"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"This song is number one on the charts."
01:01:20;01:01:21;"Wow."
01:01:21;01:01:22;"All right."
01:01:22;01:01:24;"I don't know if I want to go any deeper into--"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Let's kind of reel back into the simulation."
01:01:26;01:01:30;"Yeah, we got to get into some more pedestrian subjects."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"We're getting way too heady."
01:01:32;01:01:34;"Anyway, we're looking forward to having Thurston and Trey"
01:01:34;01:01:38;"do some pedal talk in the not-so-distant future."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"But wow, that Matrix stuff is freaky."
01:01:40;01:01:41;"[laughs]"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"All right, here's a little bit of Zurich is Stained by Pavement."
01:03:17;01:03:23;"One last thing I just want to say about Connecticut and guitar music"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"is on the text that we were talking about this,"
01:03:25;01:03:30;"that probably two of the most famous and influential guitarists"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"from Connecticut are Thurston Moore and John Mayer."
01:03:33;01:03:36;"And I wonder if they--"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"I mean, maybe The Grateful Dead is where these guys meet,"
01:03:39;01:03:43;"although I still have my doubts that Thurston even is a dead fan at all."
01:03:43;01:03:47;"But I'm curious if they care about each other's music at all."
01:03:47;01:03:50;"I have to share this only because I find it amusing."
01:03:50;01:03:53;"When we were talking about Thurston and John Mayer hanging out"
01:03:53;01:03:55;"and getting in the studio and messing around,"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"I couldn't help but picture that it was a big album"
01:03:58;01:04:02;"and a big dad rock album in the late '90s"
01:04:02;01:04:06;"was Eric Clapton and B.B. King linked up for an album called Riding with the King."
01:04:06;01:04:10;"I've never heard it before, but I feel like it was very omnipresent."
01:04:10;01:04:12;"My dad definitely had that album."
01:04:12;01:04:14;"Can you recall any of the music?"
01:04:14;01:04:20;"No, but my dad was very into buying '90s Clapton and B.B. King--"
01:04:20;01:04:23;"like, Clapton records and buying B.B. King records."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"-Okay, he was keeping up with the new stuff. -CDs."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"-Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:04:26;01:04:29;"That was a big album. I mean, it sold millions."
01:04:29;01:04:34;"And the cover is them in a cool old-school convertible,"
01:04:34;01:04:38;"and Eric Clapton's driving, and B.B. King's in the back with his guitar,"
01:04:38;01:04:41;"and they're just kind of like, ""Look at these guys cruising."""
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Two legends linking up."
01:04:43;01:04:46;"Anyway, I'm proposing a Thurston Moore-John Mayer"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"Riding with the King-type album."
01:04:48;01:04:51;"Maybe it's Riding Through Connecticut,"
01:04:51;01:04:54;"Riding Through CT, Connecticut Cruising,"
01:04:54;01:04:58;"something like that, the two of them in a convertible."
01:04:58;01:05:03;"It's possible that those guys don't know each other's music at all."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"That's really funny."
01:05:04;01:05:07;"Do you think Mayer can name five Sonic Youth songs?"
01:05:07;01:05:08;"No."
01:05:08;01:05:12;"First, from Thurston Moore, Avril Lavigne and John Mayer are laying."
01:05:12;01:05:13;"[laughter]"
01:05:13;01:05:14;"That's it?"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"What is this, an old Time Crisis episode?"
01:05:16;01:05:21;"That's a headline from August 25, 2007,"
01:05:21;01:05:26;"from the UK website Female First."
01:05:26;01:05:30;"Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore has hit out at Avril Lavigne and John Mayer"
01:05:30;01:05:33;"insisting 70-year-olds rock harder than they do."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"The rocker recently collaborated with Yoko Ono"
01:05:35;01:05:38;"and claims she's edgier than most modern artists."
01:05:38;01:05:40;"He tells Spin Magazine, ""I'm playing with Yoko Ono,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"and she's well past 70, and she rocks."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"Neil Young rocks."""
01:05:44;01:05:46;"It's certainly not John Mayer or Avril Lavigne."
01:05:46;01:05:48;"Those people don't rock."
01:05:48;01:05:52;"[laughter]"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"Well, that answers the question."
01:05:54;01:05:57;"I don't think John Mayer can name five Sonic Youth songs."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"John Mayer hits back, ""Growing up in Connecticut,"
01:06:00;01:06:02;"I didn't have a lot of guitar heroes I could look up to."
01:06:02;01:06:04;"Thurston Moore, you were one of them."
01:06:04;01:06:08;"However, I'm throwing out all of my Sonic Youth records,"
01:06:08;01:06:13;"including my rare Japanese 7-inches and some of your solo work."
01:06:13;01:06:15;"You've really hurt me."""
01:06:15;01:06:17;"All right, yeah, they don't f--- with each other."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"Thurston, I saw you at Lollapalooza '95 in Hartford."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"[laughter]"
01:06:22;01:06:28;"The last 35 minutes, a wall of noise, just feedback and static."
01:06:28;01:06:30;"Changed my life."
01:06:30;01:06:33;"If even in the late '90s Thurston was already kind of salty"
01:06:33;01:06:38;"that he didn't get a nice piece of the post-Jerry Dead pie,"
01:06:38;01:06:43;"can you imagine if people told him how Dead & Co. is out there crushing it?"
01:06:43;01:06:46;"He's like, ""Oh, yeah? Who they got on guitar? John Mayer?"""
01:06:46;01:06:54;"Thurston in 2019 just opening up Pitchfork or something."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"What's cooking? The John Mayer announcement is--"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"I guess John Mayer started playing with him in '15, right?"
01:07:00;01:07:02;"When did Mayer start playing with them?"
01:07:02;01:07:04;"Was it the Fare Thee Well era?"
01:07:04;01:07:08;"Well, it was after that, so yeah, I think probably '16, '17."
01:07:08;01:07:14;"And then word on the street is that Avril Lavigne is going to join as the new Donna."
01:07:14;01:07:16;"Just really--"
01:07:16;01:07:19;"As is often the case on Time Crisis, we've gone very deep"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"on what was probably a handful of throwaway comments from Thurston"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"more than he never thought about again."
01:07:24;01:07:26;"25 years ago."
01:07:26;01:07:30;"Yeah, he's well aware of the fact that he works squirreling the tradition"
01:07:30;01:07:34;"of the Yoko Ono's-- as Jake said earlier, the Tony Conrad's."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"[laughs]"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"Not the Jerry Garcia's. Simple as that."
01:07:39;01:07:42;"[guitar music]"
01:07:46;01:08:05;"Yeah, it's just one of those things."
01:08:05;01:08:07;"I'm sure there's examples from life, you know."
01:08:07;01:08:11;"Maybe when you're a kid and an older person says,"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"""There's another 10-year-old here."
01:08:13;01:08:15;"You guys are probably going to have a ball."""
01:08:15;01:08:18;"By the time you're 10, people are already on their own trips."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"It just doesn't always work."
01:08:20;01:08:23;"And I think there's something about this assumption that's like,"
01:08:23;01:08:25;"""You d*** around on guitar, you d*** around on guitar too."
01:08:25;01:08:27;"You guys have something in common."""
01:08:27;01:08:30;"No, man. Some people are into basketball, but they don't watch soccer."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"Even though I've heard there's a lot of similarities in gameplay."
01:08:33;01:08:37;"Is it still the Thurston Moore John Mayer album we're talking about?"
01:08:37;01:08:39;"I don't even know what we're talking about anymore,"
01:08:39;01:08:41;"so maybe it's a good reason to move on."
01:08:41;01:08:44;"Okay, speaking of bands and dudes and bands,"
01:08:44;01:08:47;"there's some very disturbing news in the U2 world."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"Seinfeld, you want to break this down for us?"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"What the hell's going on here?"
01:08:51;01:08:57;"Yeah, it seems like U2 frontman Bono is quite down on himself."
01:08:57;01:09:00;"There was a recent interview that he did while promoting a U2 song"
01:09:00;01:09:05;"from the soundtrack from the film Sing To."
01:09:05;01:09:08;"And the headline here, the tweet from Consequence,"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"""Bono reveals that he hates the name U2,"
01:09:10;01:09:13;"is 'embarrassed' by most of their songs,"
01:09:13;01:09:16;"and only 'recently' learned to sing."""
01:09:16;01:09:19;"I know the pandemic has hit us all hard,"
01:09:19;01:09:22;"but it seems like it's hit Bono hardest of all."
01:09:22;01:09:25;"And so, yeah, we were just sort of talking about that."
01:09:25;01:09:27;"And has anybody..."
01:09:27;01:09:29;"We don't want to be serving out fake news on TC."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Has anybody actually listened to the podcast?"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"Is it possible there's more context?"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"Was it a pod or was it a..."
01:09:35;01:09:37;"He was on the Award Chatter podcast."
01:09:37;01:09:39;"Yeah, Award Chatter."
01:09:39;01:09:41;"I'm not familiar with that pod."
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Yeah, this is third-hand aggregation of the news."
01:09:43;01:09:47;"I didn't personally take the time to listen to Awards Chatter."
01:09:47;01:09:52;"I don't miss an episode usually, so it's odd that I missed this one."
01:09:52;01:09:54;"Of all the ones you could have missed."
01:09:54;01:09:55;"It's weird."
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Okay, so we don't, you know, full disclosure,"
01:09:58;01:09:59;"we don't know the whole context."
01:09:59;01:10:02;"Because I could totally picture an interview"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"where Bono says something like that,"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"and then it's fully contextualized by the next time he says,"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"""I'm embarrassed by most of our songs."""
01:10:09;01:10:13;"And then he says like, ""Yeah, because I'm very easily embarrassed."
01:10:13;01:10:16;"You know, somebody tells me I'm handsome, I say, 'Oh, stop.'"
01:10:16;01:10:17;"You know, I don't know."""
01:10:17;01:10:19;"And then he's like, ""Who knows?"""
01:10:19;01:10:21;"It could have been something like that."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"But I mean, okay, this is the actual quote."
01:10:23;01:10:26;"So, you know, again, lacking context."
01:10:26;01:10:29;"You can only say for sure when you've listened to the full Award Chatter podcast."
01:10:29;01:10:32;"He said, ""I've been in the car."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"I've been in the car."""
01:10:34;01:10:36;"How do you do an Irish accent?"
01:10:36;01:10:39;"""I've been in the car when one of our songs has come on the radio."
01:10:39;01:10:43;"And I've been the color of, as we say in Dublin, scarlet."

01:10:48;01:10:49;"I'm just so embarrassed."
01:10:49;01:10:53;"The one that I can listen to the most is Miss Sarajevo with Luciano Pavarotti."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Genuine."
01:10:54;01:10:57;"Most of the other ones make me cringe a little bit."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"Most of the other ones."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"U2 literally probably has 300 songs."
01:11:01;01:11:05;"Also, the one with Pavarotti, that's the one that would make me cringe."
01:11:05;01:11:06;"Yeah."
01:11:06;01:11:09;"He's having just like a weird midlife crisis."
01:11:09;01:11:15;"Those Pavarotti collabs, though, there's some good, like, I don't know if you've heard the Mariah Carey one."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"Very powerful."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"Bryan Adams."
01:11:17;01:11:21;"Yeah, and I think he linked up with Lou Reed at one of those big concerts."

01:11:38;01:11:41;"Lou Reed and Pavarotti, ""Perfect Day."""
01:11:41;01:11:42;"It's very powerful."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"And does Pavarotti do, like, the verses, too?"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"He does, like, an Italian thing, right?"
01:11:47;01:11:48;"Oh, okay."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"Maybe I'm wrong."
01:11:49;01:11:51;"Maybe he doesn't actually sing the part I sang."

01:12:59;01:13:04;"I love the crowd sounds, too."
01:13:04;01:13:07;"Like, just the sort of eruption with Pavarotti."
01:13:07;01:13:11;"I also love the idea that this is just a song about two buddies,"

01:14:21;01:14:22;"Yeah."
01:14:22;01:14:26;"I mean, to be fair, it is that more sweet Broadway side of Lou."

01:15:47;01:15:53;"his mind off of stuff with his big, fun Italian friend, Luciano, and he tries to open up a"
01:15:53;01:15:54;"little bit."
01:15:54;01:15:55;"It doesn't come naturally to him."
01:15:55;01:15:59;"You know, he's kind of a cool guy, but he tries to open up a little bit just to say,"

01:16:17;01:16:21;"And then after that, Lou's just like, ghosts him for six months."
01:16:21;01:16:22;"He can't handle it."
01:16:22;01:16:27;"I sort of had this sort of like more happier thing, which is like, Luciano calls him and"

01:16:34;01:16:36;"You have time to go out and the plane sort of is delayed."
01:16:36;01:16:38;"They go into the zoo."""
01:16:38;01:16:41;"You sort of lose track that he said that his flight was delayed."

01:16:43;01:16:46;"It's weather or whatever, and then it's sort of at the end, they have this moment and he"
01:16:46;01:16:50;"opens up to him and that's what Luciano's always wanted from his friend."
01:16:50;01:16:52;"And he's like, ""My plane was sort of never delayed."
01:16:52;01:16:55;"I never bought a return ticket."
01:16:55;01:16:59;"Like, I basically have been sort of orchestrated this event to have--"" You know what I mean?"

01:17:10;01:17:11;"And then it's like, they have that moment."

01:17:23;01:17:24;"Yeah."

01:17:37;01:17:38;"Yeah, right?"
01:17:38;01:17:39;"That is true."
01:17:39;01:17:41;"And Metallica just in kind of an advisory capacity."

01:17:43;01:17:45;"Advisory."
01:17:45;01:17:47;"Consultation."

01:17:50;01:17:51;"Oof."

01:17:53;01:17:54;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:54;01:17:59;"And it's interesting that Lou Reed always said that that was one of his best albums"

01:18:00;01:18:01;"It's one of his best albums."
01:18:01;01:18:05;"Wait, can we-- should we do a little bit of that or should we stick with the Bono?"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"Let's go back to Bono."
01:18:06;01:18:07;"Okay."
01:18:07;01:18:10;"I do want to listen to Lulu, maybe on the next episode."
01:18:10;01:18:17;"So Bono, it's funny that we didn't listen to the song Bono was talking about, but also"

01:18:30;01:18:31;"to him."""
01:18:31;01:18:32;"Damn."
01:18:32;01:18:33;"Why is Bono worrying about what--"
01:18:33;01:18:34;"Robert Palmer."

01:18:35;01:18:38;"I mean, Robert Palmer has some cool songs, but it's like--"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"But he also sings real low."

01:18:52;01:18:53;"Yeah."

01:18:54;01:18:55;"[singing]"
01:18:55;01:18:56;"Yeah."
01:18:56;01:19:02;"He's singing like so low and like, kind of like Lou Reed."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"Robert Palmer is classically cool."
01:19:04;01:19:11;"You kind of like chic, wear like, you know, cool suits, hang out in the Caribbean, sing"
01:19:11;01:19:12;"like this."
01:19:12;01:19:13;"[singing]"
01:19:13;01:19:18;"He's in the mold of, you know, Brian Ferry."
01:19:18;01:19:19;"Yeah."
01:19:19;01:19:26;"Bono's recalling some secondhand comment that Adam Clayton heard from Robert Palmer like"
01:19:26;01:19:31;"40 years ago, and it's just stuck in his craw, man, and it's just coming back to rear its"
01:19:31;01:19:32;"ugly head."
01:19:32;01:19:33;"I can relate a little bit."
01:19:33;01:19:37;"There's been, you know, you don't forget slights in life."
01:19:37;01:19:41;"The one thing I'll say, especially you're a sensitive artist, I will say though, the"
01:19:41;01:19:46;"older you get, the more you find, you know, deeper meaning in other things, and those"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"things don't matter quite as much."
01:19:48;01:19:51;"Maybe working on Sing Too got Bono down in the dumps."
01:19:51;01:19:53;"But yeah, I feel you, Jake."
01:19:53;01:19:55;"It has Phil Collins energy."
01:19:55;01:20:02;"At the end of the day, I do think that Bono, you know, we talked about the whole iPod debacle,"
01:20:02;01:20:07;"and it was definitely like the wrong move, but there were definitely some people who"
01:20:07;01:20:12;"were ready to throw out, you know, 30 years of good heartfelt U2 music out with the bath"
01:20:12;01:20:19;"water, and Bono is probably hurt by that, and yeah, maybe he's got some - all those"
01:20:19;01:20:26;"adoring fans when they go on tour and stuff hasn't stopped his feelings of embarrassment."
01:20:26;01:20:29;"But then he's also just out here just not being the best judge of his own work."
01:20:29;01:20:32;"He says he's probably proudest of the song Vertigo."
01:20:32;01:20:34;"That's not a top five U2 song, Bono."
01:20:34;01:20:35;"No."
01:20:35;01:20:40;"No person of taste ranks Vertigo as even a top 10 U2 song."
01:20:40;01:20:45;"U2 has a lot of good songs, and also they're just like, okay, you know what, I think Bono"
01:20:45;01:20:50;"will come back from this and he'll realize, as a fan, I would like to see Bono on some"
01:20:50;01:20:51;"like, f*** it."
01:20:51;01:20:53;"I'm a passionate Irish guy."
01:20:53;01:20:54;"Yeah, I mean, he's -"
01:20:54;01:20:55;"What the f*** do you expect?"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"I'm not Brian Ferry, I'm not Robert Palmer."
01:20:57;01:21:02;"I'm a passionate man, I'm religious, I'm spiritual."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"He's political, he's an activist."
01:21:04;01:21:05;"I'm political."
01:21:05;01:21:10;"I've never gotten one hint of self-doubt from him."
01:21:10;01:21:17;"He seems like one of the most confident and sort of can-do and ambitious guys out there."
01:21:17;01:21:19;"And it's fascinating."
01:21:19;01:21:21;"He kind of does a little bit of a crack in the facade."
01:21:21;01:21:22;"I mean, he's only human."
01:21:22;01:21:24;"Yeah, it's lonely at the top."
01:21:24;01:21:26;"What's like a deep U2 song?"
01:21:26;01:21:30;"Like, you know, obviously there's the classics, you know, like Streets Have No Name or One."
01:21:30;01:21:34;"What's like a deeper U2 song that you are like, into?"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"Man, I can't even remember the names of the songs."
01:21:36;01:21:41;"I used to have like a burned CD of early U2 demos."
01:21:41;01:21:43;"What were they called?"
01:21:43;01:21:45;"That was deep."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"And there's some cool stuff there."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"I mean, yeah, okay, I don't know why."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"Everything that's coming to mind is singles."
01:21:50;01:21:53;"Yeah, I mean, that's - well, they've been pummeled into our head for the last 40 years."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"I mean -"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Yeah, U2 Deep Cut."
01:21:56;01:21:58;"Yeah, I don't know how deep."
01:21:58;01:22:00;"So Cruel from Octogbaby, a deep cut."
01:22:00;01:22:01;"That's a good song."
01:22:01;01:22:02;"That's a great one."
01:22:02;01:22:03;"Wasn't a single."
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Yeah, non-single, non-single."
01:22:05;01:22:09;"You know, even though Joshua Tree starts out with all like the big hits,"
01:22:09;01:22:12;"there's some like cool stuff on side too."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"Oh yeah, like what?"
01:22:13;01:22:14;"In God's Country."
01:22:14;01:22:15;"Or like Red -"
01:22:15;01:22:16;"Trip Through Your Wires."
01:22:16;01:22:17;"What is it called?"
01:22:17;01:22:18;"Red Hill Mining Town."
01:22:18;01:22:19;"Yeah, that one's awesome."
01:22:20;01:22:22;"From father to son"
01:22:22;01:22:25;"Through blood and skin"
01:22:25;01:22:32;"No one see faces frozen still"
01:22:32;01:22:36;"Against the world"
01:22:36;01:22:44;"The seam is split"
01:22:44;01:22:48;"The cold face cracks"
01:22:49;01:22:51;"The lines are long"
01:22:51;01:22:55;"There's no going back"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"Through hands of steel"
01:22:58;01:23:02;"And heart of stone"
01:23:02;01:23:05;"Our liberal day"
01:23:05;01:23:10;"Has come and gone"
01:23:10;01:23:14;"Hey, leave me holding on"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"In Red Hill Town"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"See life's so down, oh"
01:23:22;01:23:26;"One thing I can't help thinking about too, in this context,"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"and I have no idea about the dynamics of the band,"
01:23:28;01:23:31;"other than they're the very rare type of band where it's like"
01:23:31;01:23:35;"four childhood friends staying together for 50 years."
01:23:35;01:23:39;"Those guys have literally known each other for 50 years, maybe more."
01:23:39;01:23:42;"Maybe not quite 50, almost 50."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"But I'm just picturing the drummer,"
01:23:45;01:23:48;"or you know, somebody else in the organization being like,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"getting some texts from friends being like,"

01:23:51;01:23:52;"They're just like, ""Why?"""
01:23:52;01:23:54;"They're like, ""I don't know, he did this interview where he said"

01:23:57;01:23:59;"To be fair, I know from the quotes I've seen,"
01:23:59;01:24:00;"he went out of his way to say,"

01:24:28;01:24:29;"- No."

01:24:35;01:24:38;"I guess maybe he's hoping they'll get nominated for an Oscar."
01:24:38;01:24:41;"And while he was promoting the song from Sing To,"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"he said that the vast majority of your other songs"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"suck and embarrass him."
01:24:46;01:24:48;"Just be like, ""Oh my God."""
01:24:48;01:24:51;"Actually, throw in the song from Sing To real quick."
01:24:51;01:24:54;"- While you do that, he also,"
01:24:54;01:24:57;"obviously the headline was he also hates the name U2."
01:24:57;01:24:58;"- Great name."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- So what he said was,"
01:25:00;01:25:04;"Bono also said that he's not a huge fan of the name U2,"
01:25:04;01:25:07;"and that their first manager, Paul McGuinness,"

01:25:18;01:25:19;"It was futuristic."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"It turned out to imply this kind of acquiescence."

01:25:30;01:25:31;"- You can be stuck in a moment."
01:25:31;01:25:35;"- It sort of reminds me of the Will Smith press tour,"
01:25:35;01:25:37;"you know, when he started saying all those things."
01:25:37;01:25:38;"It's like, there's something about the fact"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"that it's the Sing To press tour."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"It's like, maybe he's just not used to this sort of thing"

01:25:46;01:25:48;"he's had this career he's had,"

01:25:58;01:25:59;"It's what it seems like."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- Well, yeah, and also he's probably,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"maybe because he's getting older,"
01:26:03;01:26:07;"he cares less about micromanaging the expectations"
01:26:07;01:26:10;"of everybody who might care or comment about you too."

01:30:42;01:30:43;"And Bono's definitely a head."
01:30:43;01:30:45;"And like, he's always done interviews"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"where he was like really wants to remind people"
01:30:46;01:30:50;"that U2 was like inspired by punk,"
01:30:50;01:30:52;"and they basically were a punk band in the early days."
01:30:52;01:30:55;"And you know, you'd be doing an interview"
01:30:55;01:30:56;"in like the 2000s,"
01:30:56;01:30:58;"and by that point it's like,"
01:30:58;01:31:00;"nobody's like giving you props"
01:31:00;01:31:02;"for like saying you're into punk."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"It's arguably like unfashionable."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"But sometimes he'd do these interviews"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"where he really seemed enthusiastic to be like,"
01:31:07;01:31:09;"we love the Ramones."
01:31:09;01:31:10;"And he would sometimes drop these like"
01:31:10;01:31:14;"kind of lesser known UK punk bands."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"You could just tell like he really like knew his (beep)"

01:31:17;01:31:20;"Like it wouldn't totally shock me"
01:31:20;01:31:24;"if like Bono was on eBay"
01:31:24;01:31:27;"buying like first pressing Wire singles."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"It wouldn't shock me."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"- No."
01:31:29;01:31:30;"- He has a little bit of that energy."
01:31:30;01:31:31;"Like he's a fan."
01:31:31;01:31:34;"And like, I think actually he,"
01:31:34;01:31:37;"I read a biography of Lou Reed a year or two ago,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"and I'm pretty sure when Lou Reed died,"
01:31:39;01:31:42;"Bono gave like a rousing wake"
01:31:42;01:31:44;"that people said like really brought the house down."
01:31:44;01:31:45;"- Wow."
01:31:45;01:31:46;"He was at the funeral?"
01:31:46;01:31:47;"- I think he was at the funeral"
01:31:47;01:31:50;"and he like gave like a really deep heartfelt."
01:31:50;01:31:52;"And you know, there's a thing people say like,"
01:31:52;01:31:53;"you know, Irish people,"
01:31:53;01:31:56;"they famously have the most fun funerals,"
01:31:56;01:31:58;"Irish wake."
01:31:58;01:32:00;"And like, people are like, yeah,"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"when you die,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"you want a Bono type person"
01:32:03;01:32:07;"giving like a really warm Irish speech about you."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"So anyway, I don't know."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"I have this vision of Bono"
01:32:09;01:32:11;"as being like a big fan or something."
01:32:11;01:32:14;"So I could imagine in his mind,"
01:32:14;01:32:16;"he's probably like,"
01:32:16;01:32:17;"it wouldn't strike me as crazy"
01:32:17;01:32:21;"that he would compare you two to some like"
01:32:21;01:32:23;"band that broke up in 1982"
01:32:23;01:32:25;"that like almost nobody gives a about,"
01:32:25;01:32:27;"but in his head, he's just like,"
01:32:27;01:32:29;"as much as he has the side that seems arrogant,"
01:32:29;01:32:32;"I'm willing to believe there's like another part of him."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"That's just like,"
01:32:33;01:32:37;"you two will never be as good as Joy Division."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"You know, like just some that like"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"most people wouldn't even think about just like"
01:32:41;01:32:44;"what they accomplished in three years."
01:32:44;01:32:47;"We have failed to do right in 40"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"or even somebody like,"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I can probably think something better than Joy Division."
01:32:50;01:32:52;"That's almost like two deeper."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Yeah."
01:32:53;01:32:55;"What's like a really random like early eighties,"
01:32:55;01:32:58;"UK, like post-punk band."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"We're not even random,"
01:32:59;01:33:00;"but just like, you know, cool."
01:33:00;01:33:04;"Like not like x-ray specs or something."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"We've never made a song half as good"
01:33:06;01:33:09;"as the worst x-ray specs song."
01:33:09;01:33:10;"We're pathetic."
01:33:10;01:33:13;"Yeah, but it sounds like he's has a temporary bout"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"of imposter syndrome."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah."
01:33:15;01:33:17;"He's like, we're posers, man."
01:33:17;01:33:19;"And the truth is all the bands that he probably thought"
01:33:19;01:33:21;"were the greatest of all time all broke up"
01:33:21;01:33:25;"and actually probably all did break up by 1982."
01:33:25;01:33:26;"You know?"
01:33:26;01:33:27;"Oh, for sure."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"And then those guys went on to like have like day jobs."
01:33:29;01:33:30;"Right."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"And he's like, you know,"
01:33:32;01:33:35;"global rock star slash hedge fund manager."
01:33:35;01:33:39;"Those are two big jobs."
01:33:39;01:33:42;"God, I wonder who else spoke at the Lou Reed funeral."
01:33:42;01:33:43;"That's fascinating."
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Like picturing like after Bono,"
01:33:45;01:33:46;"like brings a house down,"
01:33:46;01:33:48;"like James Hetfield gets up there."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"Like, Oh, I don't know."
01:33:51;01:33:55;"Well, that's a tough act to follow Bono."
01:33:55;01:33:59;"I met Lou kind of late in life."
01:33:59;01:34:03;"I don't have the same a way with words as a Paul Huston,"
01:34:03;01:34:05;"but what can I say?"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"Hell, the guy rocks, man."
01:34:08;01:34:15;"Lou rock."
01:34:15;01:34:17;"I wonder if Pavarotti was there."
01:34:17;01:34:20;"That must have been a real who's who, man."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"Bono, James Hetfield, Pavarotti."
01:34:23;01:34:26;"And Jake met Lou Reed in the last few years of his life."
01:34:26;01:34:27;"I did. Yeah."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"I told that story on the show."
01:34:28;01:34:32;"And at the time he was working on the Lulu album."
01:34:32;01:34:35;"He was magnanimous in his praise for Metallica."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"I can't because Jake, actually,"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"I'm always surprised sometimes by your opinions."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"Like, actually, we got to remember."
01:34:41;01:34:43;"I still want to revisit Nine Inch Nails because I was thinking,"
01:34:43;01:34:46;"Oh yeah, this is one of the rare times when I think about a TC thing,"
01:34:46;01:34:47;"like a week later,"
01:34:47;01:34:49;"just like what the hell is wrong with Jake, man?"
01:34:49;01:34:53;"No, I was, I was like talking about it like a week later in the studio."
01:34:53;01:34:56;"I was just like, you guys know that Jake hates Nine Inch Nails."
01:34:56;01:35:00;"Passionately hates Nine Inch Nails."
01:35:00;01:35:02;"Everybody's like, what?"
01:35:02;01:35:04;"Who did you say that to?"
01:35:04;01:35:05;"Ariel?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I think I said that to Ariel."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"He wasn't like shocked or anything."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"He's like, well, I guess that doesn't surprise me."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"Really?"
01:35:12;01:35:14;"He hates them."
01:35:14;01:35:17;"But Jake, you like Metallica, right?"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"Oh yeah."
01:35:18;01:35:22;"I'm not a metal guy at all, but yeah, Metallica rules."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"It's almost like I'm not like a huge horror movie fan,"
01:35:25;01:35:28;"but like there's a few that like kind of transcend the genre,"
01:35:28;01:35:30;"like the Exorcist or something."
01:35:30;01:35:31;"That's right."
01:35:31;01:35:32;"And like Metallica is like that."
01:35:32;01:35:36;"And like their name is even just embodies like the genre."
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Right."
01:35:37;01:35:39;"Especially like, you know, the earlier stuff."
01:35:39;01:35:40;"Yeah."
01:35:40;01:35:41;"Master of Puppets."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Master."
01:35:42;01:35:45;"Um, we're about to bang out this top five."
01:35:45;01:35:52;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:35:52;01:35:59;"Due to our full listen down of Diamond Sea by Sonic Youth,"
01:35:59;01:36:03;"all 20 minutes, we're going to have to keep this top five snappy."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"All right."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Love it."
01:36:05;01:36:09;"God, I hope the Diamond Sea by Sonic Youth isn't in the top five."
01:36:09;01:36:12;"Do another full 20 minute listen down."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"I don't know if the heads are going to make it through that."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"Okay."
01:36:15;01:36:18;"We're going to do the compare the top five songs right now with the top"
01:36:18;01:36:21;"five Billboard singles in 1981."
01:36:21;01:36:23;"Why 1981?"
01:36:23;01:36:24;"Anybody?"
01:36:24;01:36:27;"That's the year that Sonic Youth started."
01:36:27;01:36:29;"I wonder if Bono likes Sonic Youth."
01:36:29;01:36:33;"14 for the Diamond Sea first came out."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"And actually I'm looking at it."
01:36:34;01:36:38;"It looks like Diamond Sea, there actually is a new remix that's in the top five."
01:36:38;01:36:42;"So get ready, dude."
01:36:42;01:36:47;"It's Kygo and Sonic Youth featuring Ariana Grande, Diamond Sea remix."
01:36:47;01:36:49;"It's number one."
01:36:49;01:36:51;"It's actually 40 minutes."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"Time takes its crazy toll."
01:36:54;01:36:58;"We don't even have a single 20 minute song in our whole catalog."
01:36:58;01:37:01;"It's a f***ing embarrassment, man."
01:37:01;01:37:03;"Wait, did you ask if Bono likes Sonic Youth?"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"I bet not."
01:37:06;01:37:09;"I bet Bono would know some of the 80s stuff."
01:37:09;01:37:13;"100% Bono knows the song Teenage Riot."
01:37:13;01:37:14;"For sure."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"I mean, Bono, yeah."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"If he's one of these record collector guys,"
01:37:17;01:37:21;"he definitely has a copy of Daydream Nation that he bought in 1983."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"And he would know the early 90s s***,"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"like 100% and Cool Thing, that kind of stuff."
01:37:26;01:37:28;"He probably knows 100%, you're right."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"You never know with Bono."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"I have this quote from Bono."
01:37:32;01:37:35;"He's under his, I guess during Octoon Baby,"
01:37:35;01:37:39;"he had an alter ego called The Fly that I don't remember."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"But he's doing this."
01:37:40;01:37:42;"Yeah, that's his shades thing."
01:37:42;01:37:43;"That was his guy."
01:37:43;01:37:45;"That cool 90s guy was The Fly."
01:37:45;01:37:49;"So he says this, I'm having to work too fast here."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"So there's a quote from him."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"""By the way,"" so he knows of them."
01:37:53;01:37:56;"So he says, ""By the way, I think it's good that Sonic Youth and Nirvana"
01:37:56;01:37:57;"are on Geffen Records."
01:37:57;01:37:59;"I don't think they should be embarrassed by it."
01:37:59;01:38:01;"I think Kurt Cobain is a fine singer."""
01:38:01;01:38:04;"I don't, I don't, it's such an odd."
01:38:04;01:38:09;"So he said, ""Because I don't think any musician should ever be embarrassed"
01:38:09;01:38:14;"of their singing voice, nor the vast majority of their catalog."
01:38:14;01:38:17;"So I say to Sonic Youth and Nirvana, always be proud,"
01:38:17;01:38:22;"never go on a podcast, and admit that you're embarrassed."""
01:38:22;01:38:24;"All right, so yeah, he's aware of that."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"I'll never do that. Chin up, boys."
01:38:26;01:38:28;"All right, maybe we got to get Bono on the program one day."
01:38:28;01:38:33;"We've joked about this before, like getting Noel Gallagher or something."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"That could be an alternate version of Time Crisis."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Just get like rock stars and the whole thing is just like,"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"""Do you like this band? Do you like this band?"""
01:38:41;01:38:43;"Have you heard the later work?"
01:38:43;01:38:45;"I can kind of picture Bono being like,"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"""I remember the '80s stuff with Sonic Youth."
01:38:47;01:38:50;"In a way, I really became a fan."""
01:38:50;01:38:54;"You're going to laugh, but in the later, in the 2000s era,"
01:38:54;01:38:59;"Sonic Nurse, Murray Street, in a way, I connected with their music"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"more in that phase of my life."
01:39:02;01:39:04;"Okay, number five song."
01:39:04;01:39:06;"I have some important context."
01:39:06;01:39:09;"Bono is quoted saying that he fell asleep once"
01:39:09;01:39:13;"on the lighting board at a Sonic Youth concert."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"[laughter]"
01:39:15;01:39:22;"The full context is he has an allergy to something called salicylates."
01:39:22;01:39:25;"I guess that's an ingredient found in aspirin."
01:39:25;01:39:28;"It's part of why he wears those sunglasses all the time."
01:39:28;01:39:29;"What?"
01:39:29;01:39:34;"But yeah, he said he has an allergy to this salicylates."
01:39:34;01:39:38;"Quote, ""That means I lose my voice or I fall asleep in the strangest places,"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"like once on the lighting board for Sonic Youth."""
01:39:41;01:39:44;"God, must have been like a weird festival or what?"
01:39:44;01:39:45;"No!"
01:39:45;01:39:48;"He goes on to say, ""One of the loudest concerts in the world,"
01:39:48;01:39:52;"and I get red eyes, which is one of the reasons I wear the sunglasses."""
01:39:52;01:39:54;"He just rolled to the Sonic Youth show."
01:39:54;01:39:57;"Yeah, he might have just rolled to the Sonic Youth show in Dublin."
01:39:57;01:39:59;"And he's at the lighting board?"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"He's hanging by the lighting board? Okay."
01:40:01;01:40:04;"He probably knows the lighting technician if it's a local guy."
01:40:04;01:40:07;"Anyway, he likes Sonic Youth enough to go to their show, I think,"
01:40:07;01:40:10;"is what we can take from it."
01:40:10;01:40:18;"And the thing that just absolutely kills me is I fell asleep in the middle of--"
01:40:18;01:40:21;"right in the middle of the Diamond Sea,"
01:40:21;01:40:25;"and the idea that anybody may have caught me, Bono,"
01:40:25;01:40:30;"sleeping in the middle of probably one of my favorite songs of all time"
01:40:30;01:40:35;"and maybe thought it's because I couldn't hang for 20 minutes of drone jamming"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"couldn't be further from the case, man."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"It was a sublime--"
01:40:38;01:40:39;"I was an aspirin--"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"A sublime improvisation."
01:40:41;01:40:45;"I like how it says Bono as Liam Neeson, basically."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"It's become very Liam Neeson."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"It was a sublime improvisation."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"It was due to an allergic reaction to aspirin."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"Thurston hasn't talked to me in years."
01:40:57;01:41:01;"It's like a Curve episode where Thurston sees Bono asleep,"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"and he's just like--"
01:41:03;01:41:05;"Bono's like, ""Larry falls asleep at--"""
01:41:05;01:41:07;"""I have an allergy!"""
01:41:07;01:41:09;"So here's something interesting."
01:41:09;01:41:13;"Yeah, you had an allergic reaction, happened to be during the Diamond Sea."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"""It's one of my favorite songs, Thurston!"""
01:41:15;01:41:17;"""No! You gotta believe me!"""
01:41:17;01:41:21;"Okay, guys, we're getting closer."
01:41:21;01:41:24;"It takes a minute, but we're punching our way to the truth."
01:41:24;01:41:29;"The Edge has been telling HotPress.com about the inspiration behind the new U2 album,"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"which is due Summer 2003."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"So actually, we should figure out which album this is."
01:41:34;01:41:36;"2023?"
01:41:36;01:41:38;"No, 2003. So this is 20 years old."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"Oh, this is 20 years ago. Okay."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Right now--"
01:41:42;01:41:43;"We're going--"
01:41:43;01:41:46;"Okay, this is either coming out next year, it might be 20--"
01:41:46;01:41:49;"Oh, no, it's actually 20 years ago. It actually makes no difference."
01:41:49;01:41:53;"The Edge said, quote,"
01:41:53;01:41:56;"""Right now I'm getting very excited about bands playing together in a room,"
01:41:56;01:41:59;"and what that sounds like, it sounds very fresh to me."""
01:41:59;01:42:03;"So the albums I'm excited about are things like the Sonic Youth record,"
01:42:03;01:42:05;"or Mudhoney."
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Things that are very visceral."
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Mudhoney in '03."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"What was the new Sonic Youth record in around 2003?"
01:42:12;01:42:13;"Let me get a number crunch."
01:42:13;01:42:14;"Great question."
01:42:14;01:42:16;"I don't know if we're getting to the top five today, folks."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"I think we just did 81."
01:42:18;01:42:20;"I think we pound through 81."
01:42:20;01:42:23;"But I feel good when we don't do a top five."
01:42:23;01:42:25;"It doesn't feel-- The show doesn't end properly."
01:42:25;01:42:27;"You're the soul of this show, Jake. You're right."
01:42:27;01:42:30;"Oh, Sonic Nurse came out in '04."
01:42:30;01:42:32;"Murray Street '02."
01:42:32;01:42:35;"So maybe they did a live in the room, no overdubs kind of thing."
01:42:35;01:42:37;"So I was right. U2 is into Murray Street."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"You nailed it, dude."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"You're gonna laugh when I say this, but"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"my favorite era of Sonic Youth is"
01:42:44;01:42:46;"it's a Murray Street into Sonic Nurse."
01:42:46;01:42:47;"Dude, I like--"
01:42:47;01:42:49;"I mean--"
01:42:49;01:42:53;"I like Edge writing for late period Mudhoney."
01:42:53;01:42:56;"Was he really talking about a new Mudhoney record?"
01:42:56;01:42:58;"He might have. I don't know."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"See, guys, at the end of the day, everybody's--"
01:43:01;01:43:03;"there's always more than meets the eye."
01:43:03;01:43:04;"There are a lot of haters."
01:43:04;01:43:06;"They just love to see a headline like"
01:43:06;01:43:08;"""Bono's embarrassed by U2 songs."""
01:43:08;01:43:10;"""Hardy Har Har."""
01:43:10;01:43:13;"Okay, all the haters coming out of the woodworks."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"Very funny."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"Okay, yeah, you're embarrassed by their songs, too."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"You never liked them."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"""Hardy Har Har."""
01:43:19;01:43:20;"Well, guess what?"
01:43:20;01:43:22;"These guys aren't that different from you."
01:43:22;01:43:24;"They're out there listening to Murray Street."
01:43:24;01:43:26;"They're out there just trying to do their best."
01:43:26;01:43:28;"They're fans just like you."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"You don't know them."
01:43:30;01:43:31;"Anyway, go see Sing 2."
01:43:31;01:43:33;"Actually, I do have to shout out Sing 2"
01:43:33;01:43:36;"because it's directed by Garth Jennings,"
