01:35;01:37;"What's up, fellas?"
01:37;01:39;"- This is a very un-TC setting."
01:39;01:43;"- Yeah, this is like when Wayne's World went pro."
01:43;01:48;"When Rob Lowe got Wayne's World to be like a real TV show."
01:48;01:52;"Yeah, we're filming it, trying something new."
01:52;01:53;"We got Jake and Nick."
01:53;01:54;"- You know, it's interesting,"
01:54;01:57;"Seinfeld claims his flight was getting in late,"
01:57;02:00;"but also I think he likes to keep a little more mystery."
02:00;02:02;"- What would we have done?"
02:02;02:03;"- If he came?"
02:03;02:03;"- Yeah."
02:03;02:05;"- Oh, he'd wear like a Seinfeld mask?"
02:05;02:08;"I don't know, he'd probably for the best."
02:08;02:10;"- Yeah, work it out. - Let the man have some,"
02:10;02:12;"have a little bit of mystery."
02:12;02:15;"Well, here we are in Texas together."
02:15;02:17;"This is our special Austin episode"
02:17;02:20;"for the Vampire Weekend album release show,"
02:20;02:22;"plus the eclipse."
02:22;02:24;"- The TC prophecy that came true."
02:24;02:27;"- Yeah, so this idea was kind of cooked up originally on TC."
02:27;02:30;"- Yeah, like in 2017."
02:30;02:33;"- When you told me about going to the Wyoming eclipse."
02:33;02:34;"- Yeah."
02:34;02:36;"- This part we're recording before the show,"
02:36;02:37;"and you guys are gonna take it to the streets,"
02:37;02:40;"and so we'll see how it goes."
02:40;02:43;"There's been some questions about the weather."
02:43;02:44;"- It's cleared up, though."
02:44;02:45;"- Well."
02:45;02:47;"- Do you have a, you have an alt plan, right?"
02:47;02:48;"- I've been getting reports"
02:48;02:52;"from the Live Nation in-house meteorologist"
02:52;02:54;"talking about, you know, we'll see."
02:54;02:57;"I just hope that anybody who's a real eclipse head"
02:57;02:59;"doesn't come to Austin."
02:59;03:01;"You gotta be in your truck."
03:01;03:03;"- An umbraphile is what I."
03:03;03:03;"- Is it what?"
03:03;03:05;"- An umbraphile is an eclipse."
03:05;03:07;"- Is an eclipse watcher?"
03:07;03:07;"- Yes."
03:07;03:09;"- All right, let's stick with eclipse head."
03:09;03:13;"But if you're really an eclipse head,"
03:13;03:15;"you can't be coming into the city."
03:15;03:17;"You gotta be out in your truck,"
03:17;03:20;"ready to move at a moment's notice,"
03:20;03:21;"out in big sky country."
03:21;03:25;"But people are saying even if it's cloudy,"
03:25;03:27;"there'll be some interesting vibes."
03:27;03:28;"Yeah, so we'll see."
03:28;03:29;"We'll see how the weather goes,"
03:29;03:31;"but it's very nice that we're all convening here."
03:31;03:34;"Jake, you've been in Texas for a few days as of I."
03:34;03:37;"- Yeah, I just drove in from Dallas this afternoon."
03:37;03:40;"The last thing I did before getting in the car"
03:40;03:43;"was step in like two feet of mud."
03:43;03:44;"- Whoa."
03:44;03:46;"- On the banks of the Trinity River in Dallas."
03:46;03:46;"- Whoa."
03:46;03:50;"- And then hop directly in the car and drive straight here."
03:50;03:52;"Dropped the car at Austin Airport,"
03:52;03:53;"got in a taxi here,"
03:53;03:56;"pounded a Topo Chico, I'm ready to go."
03:56;03:58;"- My first question for you is somebody who I know,"
03:58;04:01;"like me, is prone to breaking a song."
04:01;04:03;"If somebody says a phrase or something"
04:03;04:05;"that reminds you of something."
04:05;04:06;"When you're in Texas,"
04:06;04:08;"what are the Texas songs that come to mind?"
04:08;04:09;"I know there must be a lot."

04:16;04:18;"and then coming back to Texas and just being like."

06:25;06:26;"- Silver Juice?"
06:26;06:28;"I mean, I was singing that one the whole time I was in Dallas."

06:41;06:44;"- Wait, have you ever seen Dallas from a DC nine at night?"
06:44;06:47;"- Yeah, let's throw it on."
06:47;06:48;"- The Silver Juice,"
06:48;06:50;"'cause I was there in Dallas photographing for a few days."
06:50;06:52;"- DC nine."
06:52;06:53;"- It's a DC nine."
06:53;06:54;"- The Silver Juice song,"
06:54;06:56;"I was singing that to myself in the rental car."

07:18;07:19;"- Into buildings made of mirrors."
07:19;07:20;"- Made of mirrors."
07:20;07:22;"Is Dallas really shiny?"
07:22;07:24;"- There's a lot of those blue office buildings"

08:35;08:38;"the high capacity DC eight in 1959,"
08:38;08:40;"Douglas was interested in producing an aircraft"
08:40;08:41;"suited for smaller routes."
08:41;08:43;"So it's just probably more of a--"
08:43;08:45;"- It's just the way you take when you're flying"

08:46;08:47;"- Yeah."
08:50;08:51;"- That's a tight flight."
08:51;08:53;"- Have you ever seen Dallas"
08:53;08:57;"from a regional commuter flight at night?"
08:57;08:58;"Yeah."
08:58;09:00;"So what?"
09:00;09:03;"Is Dallas, yeah,"
09:03;09:06;"how come there's no songs like this about Houston?"
09:06;09:07;"Or Austin?"
09:07;09:10;"- Well, so I think I was telling you before, Ezra,"
09:10;09:15;"I was watching that doc series on the making of RoboCop."
09:15;09:17;"- Oh, RoboDoc, yeah, check that out after you told me about it."
09:17;09:20;"- And that, you know, when they were trying to find"
09:20;09:23;"kind of the craziest futuristic shiny city."
09:23;09:24;"- Oh, right, they came to Dallas."
09:24;09:26;"- They found Dallas."
09:26;09:27;"So."
09:27;09:28;"- Did you know that, Jake?"
09:28;09:29;"- No."
09:31;09:34;"- Because RoboCop is set in futuristic Detroit."
09:34;09:35;"- Right."
09:35;09:37;"- And when they went to Detroit,"
09:37;09:39;"they were like, this doesn't really feel"
09:39;09:40;"like what we're looking for."
09:40;09:42;"And then so, you know, the production designer,"
09:42;09:45;"and then Paul Verhoeven, a Dutch guy"
09:45;09:47;"who can really look at America objectively,"
09:47;09:50;"coming from another country, he looked all around America"
09:50;09:52;"and they saw Dallas and they said, this is it."
09:52;09:53;"- This feels right."
09:53;09:55;"- This feels like futuristic Detroit."
09:55;09:57;"- Specifically the Dallas city hall."
09:57;09:59;"- So they shot RoboCop in Dallas?"
09:59;10:00;"- Yeah."
10:00;10:01;"- Yeah."
10:01;10:02;"- That's awesome."
10:02;10:05;"- There's something pretty deep about Dallas, I guess."
10:05;10:08;"And actually there's a song that actually Vampire Weekend"
10:08;10:11;"covered for a Japanese B-side, beautiful."
10:11;10:12;"One of my favorite songs of all time,"
10:12;10:16;"Mickey Newberry, whose name checked in Lucanbock, Texas,"
10:16;10:20;"called I Don't Think Much About Her No More."
10:20;10:21;"You know this guy?"
10:21;10:26;"♪ I don't think much about her ♪"
10:26;10:29;"Just this very beautiful, quiet song."
10:33;10:36;"And pretty meta."
10:36;10:50;"(whistling)"
10:50;10:55;"So this song is all about memory."
10:55;10:58;"And also the narrator of this song,"
10:58;10:59;"Mickey Newberry, whatever,"
10:59;11:00;"the whole thing is,"
11:00;11:03;"it's a little bit of a Lady Doth Protest Too Much situation"
11:03;11:04;"'cause the title of the song is"
11:04;11:06;"I Don't Think Much About Her No More."
11:06;11:08;"But he keeps talking about it so much."
11:08;11:14;"Seldom, if ever, does she cross my mind."
11:14;11:16;"Yesterday's gone, Lord, it's better forgotten,"
11:16;11:20;"like the poison red berries to die on the vine."
11:20;11:23;"So really it's almost like some eternal sunshine thing."
11:23;11:26;"He wants to forget, but he's having a hard time."
11:26;11:28;"But this is such a beautiful song."
11:28;11:31;"(whistling)"
11:31;11:44;"It's a little slow."
11:44;11:47;"Takes a minute to--"
11:47;11:49;"- Well this is a radio show, so."
11:49;11:49;"- Yeah."
11:49;11:50;"- If you think about it,"
11:50;11:54;"if this was just audio, it would be fine."
11:54;11:55;"- Yeah, right."

14:51;14:52;"having a great time, then I remembered a time."
14:52;14:54;"Then he takes you into the memory"
14:54;14:56;"and suddenly his mind takes him to Dallas."
14:56;14:59;"I can still see the bright lights in Dallas."
14:59;15:03;"And he said, yesterday moves like a dream through my mind."
15:03;15:05;"Now he's back, he's singing about her again."
15:05;15:08;"And he says, wow, I didn't think I'd ever"
15:08;15:10;"stop thinking about her."
15:10;15:11;"And it really took me a long time"
15:11;15:12;"to stop thinking about her."
15:12;15:14;"He says, as he's thinking about her"
15:14;15:16;"and then he pivots back,"
15:16;15:17;"but I don't think much about her no more."
15:17;15:20;"It's literally, you watch somebody's mind wander"
15:20;15:22;"back to coffee with the boys."
15:22;15:24;"Anyway, catch the game last night."
15:24;15:24;"- It's truly-"
15:24;15:26;"- And he's trying to be present with his friends,"
15:26;15:30;"but he's also fixating on the past."
15:30;15:31;"- Yeah."
15:31;15:31;"- I hate that when there's something"
15:31;15:33;"you don't want to think about."
15:33;15:33;"- Right."
15:33;15:34;"- You haven't thought about it in a second"
15:34;15:35;"and you are doing your thing."
15:35;15:37;"And all of a sudden you're like, oh,"
15:37;15:40;"that, like that issue in my life"
15:40;15:43;"that I haven't thought about for the last nine hours"
15:43;15:43;"just popped in."
15:43;15:45;"Sometimes you can't control it, pops in."
15:45;15:48;"- I mean, it's literally like a song,"
15:48;15:53;"sonic description of pushing a memory back down."
15:53;15:55;"'Cause yeah, he's thinking about it."
15:55;15:58;"And he's like, good thing I don't think about that anymore"
15:58;16:01;"because when I think about it, I don't like it that much."
16:01;16:02;"But anyway, the thing he sees,"
16:02;16:05;"he's taken back to the bright lights of Dallas."
16:05;16:05;"- I wonder if Dallas-"
16:05;16:06;"- How bright are these lights?"
16:06;16:07;"- Yeah, I wonder if it was ahead of the curve."
16:07;16:09;"- I've been trying to look up a bird's eye view."
16:09;16:11;"Is it that also just being in Texas,"
16:11;16:13;"there's nothing else around it?"
16:13;16:14;"- Yeah, well, I think when you see,"
16:14;16:16;"there's a triangle of Dallas."
16:16;16:20;"- But do you know, because they're all about the lights."
16:20;16:24;"- Maybe Dallas was ahead of the curve in the 20th century"
16:24;16:28;"on like, wow, that's a contemporary bright skyline."
16:28;16:30;"I mean, I would think of like Vegas would be"
16:30;16:33;"much more contrasty with the landscape."
16:33;16:35;"- Have you ever seen Vegas from a DC nine at night?"
16:35;16:38;"I mean, the truth is any city from a DC nine at night"
16:38;16:39;"is gonna be like-"
16:39;16:40;"- It's gonna look awesome."
16:40;16:41;"- Look at that."
16:41;16:42;"But there's something, yeah, clearly,"
16:42;16:43;"there's a thread between all these."
16:43;16:44;"No, but I think you're right."
16:44;16:48;"Dallas is famously a loaded city, big money."
16:48;16:51;"- Yeah, I think it looms larger"
16:51;16:52;"in the popular imagination than Houston,"
16:52;16:54;"even though Houston's the bigger city."
16:54;16:57;"I'm trying to think of Houston songs."
16:57;17:00;"I'm sure they exist, but in our milieu, at least."
17:00;17:05;"- Yeah, and besides Beyonce, what are the big Houston songs?"
17:06;17:09;"Does Dallas just sing better?"
17:09;17:09;"- Could be."
17:09;17:12;"♪ Lord, I can see the bright lights back in Houston ♪"
17:12;17:14;"- Not that bad."
17:14;17:15;"- Works."
17:15;17:18;"- Maybe Dallas was because of the big money,"
17:18;17:20;"although Houston has the oil money too, I don't know."
17:20;17:21;"- I don't know."
17:21;17:24;"Can we throw in Silver Jews, Dallas?"

19:46;19:47;"- Yeah."
19:47;19:48;"- I haven't seen it in years, but."
19:48;19:52;"- It's like after he made his three famous movies"
19:52;19:54;"like ""Fistful of Dollars,"" ""Good, Bad, and the Ugly,"""
19:54;19:57;"with the iconic Ennio Morricone scores."
19:57;20:01;"And then he made a kind of like slightly less official trilogy,"
20:01;20:03;"which were his last three movies."
20:03;20:05;"The middle one is ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"""
20:05;20:09;"and the final one in the '80s was ""Once Upon a Time in America,"""
20:09;20:11;"obviously a big influence on Quentin Tarantino."
20:11;20:15;"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is like Robert De Niro"
20:15;20:19;"and James Woods are like Jewish gangsters in like the '20s."
20:19;20:22;"But ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"""
20:22;20:26;"I've always found to be a very moving film"
20:26;20:27;"'cause there's something about it."
20:27;20:29;"It was like his final Western,"
20:29;20:30;"like the king of the spaghetti Western,"
20:30;20:32;"and it's like this big epic."
20:32;20:34;"Has amazing Ennio Morricone music,"
20:34;20:38;"but it's about after him making these iconic movies"
20:38;20:41;"about like the kind of rawness of the West,"
20:41;20:43;"like gunslingers going toe to toe,"
20:43;20:47;"the Clint Eastwood, the iconic American individual,"
20:47;20:50;"just like bad boys not playing by your rules."
20:50;20:52;"""Once Upon a Time in the West"" is kind of about"
20:52;20:55;"like people fighting over the land"
20:55;20:59;"that's gonna become the town where the railroad's coming to."
20:59;21:01;"So in some ways, it's about the end of the West."
21:01;21:05;"It's about the end of like the individual,"
21:05;21:07;"like, you know, fighting."
21:07;21:08;"It's like the beginning of--"
21:08;21:11;"And he was like a real lefty Marxist type,"
21:11;21:13;"so in his mind-- - Oh, really?"
21:13;21:15;"I didn't know that. - Yeah, he was--"
21:15;21:17;"In his mind, it was probably also about like"
21:17;21:20;"the beginning of like the hardcore capitalist era,"
21:20;21:24;"and so it's about like the train and people like--"
21:24;21:25;"So no longer just like killing each other"
21:25;21:27;"just to see like who gets the treasure."
21:27;21:30;"It's like killing each other for who gets like a foothold"
21:30;21:33;"of the new town that's gonna be built,"
21:33;21:35;"and it's kind of like--"
21:35;21:36;"It's got this amazing music."
21:36;21:38;"- So definitely we're--"
21:38;21:40;"Quentin Tarantino doing ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"""
21:40;21:41;"about the same thing."
21:41;21:43;"- Yeah, kind of about that-- - Yeah, the transition."
21:43;21:44;"- The end of an era. - Yeah."
21:44;21:46;"- And it's like after the bad guy--"
21:46;21:48;"Spoiler alert, the bad guy dies,"
21:48;21:51;"but at the end of it, it kind of ends with--"
21:51;21:54;"After all this like pain and suffering and fighting,"
21:54;21:56;"and you like kind of watch--"
21:56;21:58;"The good guy's kind of one,"
21:58;22:01;"and you watch them like kind of get to work"
22:01;22:03;"building the town where the train is gonna be,"
22:03;22:06;"and there's like this beautiful theme place,"
22:06;22:08;"and there's this like kind of weird sad energy"
22:08;22:11;"about like all the craziness, all the bloodiness,"
22:11;22:13;"all the terrible things of like the history"
22:13;22:16;"of the West, and it's kind of like,"
22:16;22:18;"""Good, things settled down,"""
22:18;22:20;"but there's also this like sadness"
22:20;22:22;"as it becomes modernity,"
22:22;22:25;"and like the town is finally built."
22:25;22:30;"The lone-- The itinerant dudes, you know,"
22:30;22:33;"riding horses and having adventures and stuff,"
22:33;22:35;"it's kind of like now it's--"
22:35;22:37;"- It's coming to a close. - Here's the town."
22:37;22:38;"It's gonna be a city."
22:38;22:39;"It's literally that same concept"
22:39;22:42;"of like taking a billion steers"
22:42;22:46;"or taking this crazy mix of nature and violence,"
22:46;22:52;"and finally it's settling into just a town"
22:52;22:54;"for better and for worse."
22:54;23:04;"- Yeah, this is haunting. - Yeah, very haunting."
23:04;23:11;"And actually, Clint Eastwood's not in this movie."
23:11;23:13;"Charles Bronson plays the kind of mysterious--"
23:13;23:14;"- Oh, yeah. - Sick."
23:14;23:15;"- Badass dude."
23:15;23:17;"- Would've been cool if he made a movie after this"
23:17;23:22;"that was set in like, yeah, like contemporary Dallas"
23:22;23:27;"or contemporary Reno or something in the '60s"
23:27;23:29;"as like the glass office buildings"
23:29;23:30;"are starting to go up."
23:30;23:31;"- Right. - Some sort of like"
23:31;23:35;"real estate scam, insurance drama or something."
23:35;23:39;"- I guess that's what all these movies are about."
23:39;23:42;"Like, yeah, if you do a ""Once Upon a Time"" movie,"
23:42;23:44;"it has to be about the end of an era."
23:44;23:46;"- Yeah. - ""Once Upon a Time in the West"""
23:46;23:47;"is about the end of the world."
23:47;23:49;"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is about these--"
23:49;23:51;"it's kind of a similar thing."
23:51;23:53;"It's you watch these like scrap--"
23:53;23:55;"you know, it's like something you've seen a million times."
23:55;23:56;"It's kind of like ""The Godfather,"""
23:56;23:58;"watching like scrappy young dudes, classic,"
23:58;24:00;"Lower East Side, like 1905,"
24:00;24:01;"just like beating each other up."
24:01;24:03;"- In my neighborhood. - Yeah, it's definitely"
24:03;24:06;"like in my neighborhood, running past horses"
24:06;24:09;"and streetcars and getting in fights."
24:09;24:10;"And then it kind of like ends where like"
24:10;24:14;"maybe one of them became like a senator or something."
24:14;24:15;"But it's that same thing,"
24:15;24:18;"like the turning into the same way that, yeah,"
24:18;24:22;"""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" is about the end of like"
24:22;24:24;"the golden age of Hollywood"
24:24;24:28;"and also kind of ends on this like bittersweet note."
24:28;24:32;"Charles Manson is defeated, but also, you know..."
24:32;24:35;"- Mm. - Something's over."
24:35;24:38;"[music continues]"
24:38;25:03;"- Are there any Austin songs?"

25:05;25:07;"called ""Leaving Austin."""
25:07;25:08;"It's a great one. - Throw it on."
25:08;25:10;"- It's about leaving Austin to go to Dallas."
25:10;25:12;"- To go to the bright lights of Dallas."
25:12;25:13;"- Have you ever seen it? - In a DC-9."
25:13;25:15;"- To get to that DC-9."
25:15;25:17;"- I just chartered a DC-9."
25:17;25:20;"- No, this is a good one. This, I would say, this is a..."

28:55;28:56;"- This sort of has reminded me--"
28:56;28:57;"this song reminds me a little bit of the song"
28:57;28:59;"that makes me think of Jake whenever--"
28:59;29:01;"there's this Sam Hunt song called ""Walmart."""
29:01;29:02;"Did I send this to you guys?"
29:02;29:03;"- Sounds familiar."
29:03;29:04;"- It's called ""Walmart,"""
29:04;29:06;"which obviously makes me think of Jake."
29:06;29:10;"But this song is about a guy who broke up with this girl,"
29:10;29:11;"and he's, like, always thought,"
29:11;29:13;"""Oh, she was, like, the one that got away."""
29:13;29:14;"But he doesn't see her."
29:14;29:18;"He sees her, like, a daughter she's had with another guy."
29:18;29:19;"- Uh-huh."
29:19;29:20;"- And so he, like, kind of feels happy"
29:20;29:21;"she could have a daughter."
29:21;29:23;"You know, she's running through Walmart eating chips."
29:23;29:25;"And he's like, ""Oh, I saw your daughter,"
29:25;29:26;"and, like, you got this whole other life,"
29:26;29:28;"so that makes me feel okay."""
29:28;29:30;"- Mm, 'cause he knows he wasn't right for her."
29:30;29:31;"- He wasn't right for her."
29:31;29:33;"- It's, like, one of the most beautiful songs of all time."
29:33;29:34;"I've said it many times."
29:34;29:36;"""I Will Always Love You."""
29:36;29:37;"Dolly Parton."
29:37;29:38;"The same thing."
29:38;29:40;"""I know it's not right."
29:40;29:41;"I would only get in your way."
29:41;29:44;"Not right for you, but I'll always love you."""
29:44;29:46;"- I love that, just being called Walmart."
29:46;29:47;"- Yeah, it's ""I Will Always Love You"""

30:42;30:45;"- Yeah, I think I'm the last person on Earth"
30:45;30:46;"to hear your album."
30:46;30:47;"- As you should be."

31:01;31:04;"- Came out, and then I was, like, in my zone"
31:04;31:05;"driving around in a rental car."
31:05;31:07;"I was getting in and out of the car every five minutes."
31:07;31:09;"I didn't want to, like, start--"
31:09;31:10;"I wanted to listen to the record."
31:10;31:13;"I wanted to listen to the record without it stopping."
31:13;31:15;"- So you had finally had time driving from Dallas to Austin."
31:15;31:16;"- So I listened to it twice in a row."
31:16;31:18;"I listened to it all the way through."
31:18;31:21;"Then I did 45 minutes of silence,"
31:21;31:22;"and then I pushed play."
31:22;31:23;"- Just to process?"
31:23;31:25;"- Yeah, I didn't want to just, like,"
31:25;31:26;"go right back into it."
31:26;31:29;"- Did you feel like you'd heard a lot of it before?"
31:29;31:31;"I've played you stuff here and there."
31:31;31:32;"- Not really, man."
31:32;31:33;"- Okay."
31:33;31:35;"- You had played me a demo of ""Capricorn"""
31:35;31:38;"like three years ago, which we discussed on the show."
31:38;31:39;"- Yeah."
31:39;31:41;"- And then I've heard the four singles."
31:41;31:42;"- Yeah."
31:42;31:44;"- So, I mean, the last song, ""Hope."""
31:44;31:45;"- Yeah, had you ever heard that?"
31:45;31:47;"- Well, it's such, like, a classic-sounding"
31:47;31:51;"kind of old kind of folk song at its core"
31:51;31:52;"that I was, like--"
31:52;31:53;"- And the chorus comes over and over again."
31:53;31:54;"- Yeah, and I was, like, when the chorus started"
31:54;31:57;"for the first time, it was immediately familiar."
31:57;31:59;"And I was, like, well, is it, like,"
31:59;32:02;"the undeniable logic of the song that's familiar?"
32:02;32:05;"Or did I hear this three or four years ago?"
32:05;32:06;"- Right."

32:49;32:50;"- Oh, nice. Thank you."
32:50;32:51;"- 'Cause..."
32:51;32:52;"- We got--"
32:52;32:53;"- It was like three episodes ago,"
32:53;32:55;"we listened to the first two singles."
32:55;32:58;"- Yeah, we'd listened to classical and--"
32:58;33:00;"No, we listened to classical and Mary Boone on the last show."
33:00;33:02;"- And then before that, we listened to the other ones."
33:02;33:03;"But yeah."
33:03;33:04;"- Yeah."
33:04;33:05;"We got lucky with the flow."
33:05;33:06;"I knew all--"
33:06;33:08;"I knew that ""Ice Cream Piano"" was track one,"
33:08;33:10;"and I knew ""Hope"" was track ten."
33:10;33:11;"- Oh, interesting."
33:11;33:13;"- And I really wanted to keep it at ten."
33:13;33:15;"There was a moment where it almost became 11 songs."
33:15;33:17;"Almost dropped ""New York Hospital"" on it."
33:17;33:18;"- You did express some--"
33:18;33:19;"- Which is a good song."
33:19;33:20;"- Concern about opening--"
33:20;33:23;"having the first line be ""f***"" at some point."
33:23;33:24;"- Dropping ""Nef Bomb""?"
33:24;33:25;"- Yeah."
33:25;33:28;"- I don't want to alienate the families."
33:28;33:30;"- Well, it's an adult band."
33:30;33:31;"- But you know what?"
33:31;33:32;"And also the truth is--"
33:32;33:33;"- You guys are pushing for it."
33:33;33:34;"- One of our most--"
33:34;33:35;"- You can swear."
33:35;33:36;"- One of our most famous early--"
33:36;33:38;"That's actually something I've noticed, too,"
33:38;33:39;"being a parent,"
33:39;33:40;"when people drop ""Nef Bomb"""
33:40;33:44;"or any sort of foul language in the house,"
33:44;33:46;"and they see your kids around and say,"
33:46;33:47;"""Oh, I'm sorry."""
33:47;33:48;"I always say, ""Let 'em hear it."""
33:48;33:49;"- Yeah, I don't--"
33:49;33:50;"I've noticed that with you."
33:50;33:51;"- I don't care."
33:51;33:52;"- Yeah, let the boy--"
33:52;33:54;"[laughs]"
33:54;33:55;"Let the boy hear it."
33:55;33:57;"And--but also--but the truth is,"
33:57;33:59;"I also feel like--"
33:59;34:00;"[laughs]"
34:00;34:01;"I also just feel like,"
34:01;34:02;"just like many things in life,"
34:02;34:04;"there's something good about being like,"
34:04;34:06;"this foul language is out there."
34:06;34:07;"You might hear it."
34:07;34:08;"You might even hear Mommy or Daddy"
34:08;34:10;"drop it every now and then,"
34:10;34:12;"as long as you understand it's an adult word."
34:12;34:13;"Just like, would you have a beer"
34:13;34:15;"in front of your daughter, Jake?"
34:15;34:16;"- Absolutely."
34:16;34:17;"- But you're not gonna let her have one."
34:17;34:18;"- Nope."
34:18;34:19;"- Exactly."
34:19;34:21;"So I kind of--I put it in the same category."
34:21;34:22;"- I like that."
34:22;34:23;"Beer and swearing."
34:23;34:24;"- Yeah."
34:24;34:25;"- That's stuff for grownups."
34:25;34:26;"- And actually, one--"
34:26;34:27;"[laughs]"
34:27;34:28;"- Coffee, too."
34:28;34:29;"- Yeah, that's right."
34:29;34:32;"One time, my son was trying to tell us a story,"
34:32;34:33;"and he kind of got, like, flummoxed,"
34:33;34:34;"and he's like,"
34:34;34:37;"""Uh, this part involves a bad word."""
34:37;34:39;"And I was like, ""You can say it."
34:39;34:40;"You can say it in the context."""
34:40;34:41;"- Stupid."
34:41;34:42;"- He was like--"
34:42;34:43;"It was shut up."
34:43;34:44;"It was like--"
34:44;34:45;"But he was, like, really--"
34:45;34:47;"He said, ""You know, you're being thoughtful."""
34:47;34:49;"Anyway, how did we get on that?"
34:49;34:50;"- The first word on the album."
34:50;34:52;"- Oh, no, and I was saying, 'cause our first album,"
34:52;34:54;"one of the biggest songs, ""Oxford Comma,"""
34:54;34:55;"which is full of F-bombs."
34:55;34:57;"It is pretty funny to picture that--"
34:57;34:58;"our sweet first album"
34:58;35:01;"with a ""Parental Advisory"" explicit lyrics on it, but--"
35:01;35:05;"- Are those the only two swears in the ""Vampire"" catalog?"
35:05;35:06;"""Oxford Comma"" and--"
35:06;35:07;"What's the first one called?"
35:07;35:08;"""Ice Cream Piano""?"
35:08;35:09;"- Yeah."
35:09;35:10;"That's a good question."
35:10;35:11;"Maybe."
35:11;35:12;"Yeah."
35:12;35:13;"- Another question."
35:13;35:14;"- Yeah."
35:14;35:16;"- Is that the only fade?"
35:16;35:17;"- In ""Vampire Weekend"" history?"
35:17;35:19;"- Yeah."
35:19;35:21;"I love that ending of the surfer,"
35:21;35:23;"that deep kind of--"
35:23;35:25;"- That's an R.L. Cole."
35:25;35:26;"- That instrumental passage you go into."
35:26;35:28;"- There's not a ton of fades."
35:28;35:29;"- It really stood out."
35:29;35:30;"I was like--"
35:30;35:31;"- At the bare minimum, there's not a lot."
35:31;35:32;"- A ""Vampire"" fade."
35:32;35:33;"- ""Vampire"" fade."
35:33;35:35;"- 'Cause usually guys have, like, the hard out."
35:35;35:36;"- Yeah."
35:36;35:38;"- Bump, bump, bump, bump."
35:38;35:40;"- But a lot of the sequencing--"
35:40;35:43;"I've always relied heavily on other people for sequencing."
35:43;35:45;"Even when we were in college,"
35:45;35:47;"a couple things I put my foot down about"
35:47;35:49;"when I wanted to start the band was saying,"
35:49;35:51;"""I'm open to collaboration for sure,"
35:51;35:53;"""but I want to pick the songs."""
35:53;35:55;"I just didn't want to have to be, like,"
35:55;35:56;"voting on songs all the time,"
35:56;35:58;"and I felt like I could judge--"
35:58;35:59;"somebody needed to be, like,"
35:59;36:01;"the final arbiter of the material."
36:01;36:03;"But that said, I never felt like"
36:03;36:04;"I had a great knack for sequencing."
36:04;36:05;"You know who's really good at it?"
36:05;36:06;"Baio."
36:06;36:07;"- Well, with the live shows,"
36:07;36:08;"doesn't he do a lot of the set lists?"
36:08;36:11;"- He almost always does the first draft of the set list."
36:11;36:13;"And I might have some opinions here and there,"
36:13;36:15;"but he's got good instincts with it."
36:15;36:17;"And an interesting one in that regard"
36:17;36:18;"is that he--"
36:18;36:21;"it was his call to make Classical track two."
36:21;36:22;"- The way those--"
36:22;36:26;"the ice cream piano goes into Classical is so sick."
36:26;36:27;"It almost feels like one song."
36:27;36:29;"- Yeah, and they're in the same key."
36:29;36:30;"- Oh, really? - Which is pretty good."
36:30;36:31;"- Okay."
36:31;36:33;"- And they're both in C, Classic."
36:33;36:35;"And then Capricorn's in G,"
36:35;36:36;"so so far it's, like, flowing."
36:36;36:37;"- Yeah."
36:37;36:38;"- And I don't know why."
36:38;36:39;"For some reason, I just thought"
36:39;36:41;"Classical was, like, a back half thing."
36:41;36:42;"But now I look back, and I'm like,"
36:42;36:44;"I'm so glad Classical is there"
36:44;36:46;"because actually the narrative--"
36:46;36:50;"I only saw the narrative once it was kind of sequenced."
36:50;36:51;"Because there is--"
36:51;36:52;"'cause Class--you know,"
36:52;36:53;"we talk about this a little bit"
36:53;36:54;"when we listen to Classical,"
36:54;36:55;"how, like, ice cream piano"
36:55;36:57;"with the ""f*ck the world"" energy,"
36:57;37:01;"Classical with the ""cruel"" becomes classical,"
37:01;37:03;"Capricorn has some brightness,"
37:03;37:05;"but, you know, Connect, I can't connect."
37:05;37:07;"It's good that those are clustered in the beginning."
37:07;37:08;"- So the album brightens?"
37:08;37:11;"- Yeah, and maybe it doesn't, like, sonically brighten,"
37:11;37:14;"but I do think ""The Surfer"" represents, like, a big turn"
37:14;37:17;"'cause, you know, it's, like, this big song in the middle"
37:17;37:19;"and has kind of, like, a different energy."
37:19;37:20;"I just think, like, lyrically,"
37:20;37:24;"the kind of, like, worldview kind of changes towards the end."
37:24;37:25;"- Mm-hmm."
37:25;37:26;"- I'm glad we went with that,"
37:26;37:28;"and I'm glad it was only 10 tracks."
37:28;37:29;"- What's it like?"
37:29;37:31;"Is it, like, 35 minutes?"
37:31;37:32;"- No, it's 47 minutes."
37:32;37:34;"- Some of the songs are long, so it's 47."
37:34;37:35;"- Really?"
37:35;37:36;"- Well, 'cause ""Hope"" is 8 minutes."
37:36;37:37;"- Flew by. - Good."
37:37;37:38;"- That's what I want to hear."
37:38;37:39;"- I like 35, dude."
37:39;37:43;"- Yeah, ""Hope"" is 8 minutes and ""Connect"" is over 5."
37:43;37:44;"- 8-minute ""Hope,"" dude."
37:44;37:45;"- 8-minute ""Hope."""
37:45;37:46;"I mean, we could--"
37:46;37:50;"so it would be really easy to get ""Hope"" to 10."
37:50;37:52;"- I really like, on ""Hope,"""
37:52;37:55;"there's, like, the song that you maybe wrote"
37:55;37:57;"on an acoustic guitar or something."
37:57;37:58;"- Yeah."
37:58;38:00;"- It has this really classic, timeless--"
38:00;38:01;"it kind of--that's the only song"
38:01;38:03;"that kind of reminded me of ""The Dead"" a little bit."
38:03;38:04;"- Mm."
38:04;38:07;"- And it felt like a--it's a song that you wrote,"
38:07;38:10;"but it feels like it could have been some old song"
38:10;38:11;"that you resurrected somehow."
38:11;38:13;"- It really feels like-- - It's totally folksong."
38:13;38:14;"- A new Dylan to me."
38:14;38:15;"I mean, that's--"
38:15;38:17;"- But I was gonna say, like, I really like"
38:17;38:19;"how you sort of start playing with the chord progression."
38:19;38:22;"Like, there's that whole, like, long instrumental part"
38:22;38:23;"on ""Hope."""
38:23;38:24;"- Oh, yeah, there's a bridge"
38:24;38:25;"where it totally changes."
38:25;38:26;"- And it just--I don't know."
38:26;38:27;"- [hums]"
38:27;38:28;"- I was just driving at 80 miles an hour"
38:28;38:29;"listening to it twice, so I was like--"
38:29;38:31;"it's such a basic chord progression,"
38:31;38:32;"and it's interesting--"
38:32;38:35;"or it sounded like that to me."
38:35;38:37;"And then you--it was interesting how you could"
38:37;38:39;"really pull out so much variation."
38:39;38:40;"- Oh, yeah, the bridge goes somewhere different."
38:40;38:42;"And then with all these, like, little parts"
38:42;38:45;"coming in and out, it takes it on a journey."
38:45;38:46;"- Yeah. - Yeah, and that song--"
38:46;38:47;"that song, it's only five--"
38:47;38:50;"I kept thinking that song-- 'cause, I mean, to me,"
38:50;38:51;"that's, like, the closest we've had"
38:51;38:54;"to, like, a Dylan or a Neil Young song"
38:54;38:56;"that's just a lot of verses."
38:56;38:57;"- Yeah. - Where, yeah,"
38:57;38:59;"like, the classic folksong structure"
38:59;39:00;"where the chorus is simple,"
39:00;39:02;"and then you got your chorus,"
39:02;39:04;"and then you just start thinking about"
39:04;39:06;"how many different ways can I slice this"
39:06;39:07;"with different verses?"
39:07;39:10;"I might have written 12 verses for it."
39:10;39:11;"- And how many is it? It's only--"
39:11;39:14;"- It's only five in the end. - Interesting."
39:14;39:16;"- But, you know, you could argue--"
39:16;39:17;"I don't know."
39:17;39:19;"Are they double verses or something?"
39:19;39:21;"But, yeah, I really, like, spent a lot of time"
39:21;39:23;"over the years, like, thinking which verses"
39:23;39:26;"I thought kind of, like, really fit the--"
39:26;39:29;"the tone of the song and making sure"
39:29;39:32;"they were, like, kind of different enough."
39:32;39:34;"And that was--you know, there's, like,"
39:34;39:35;"a heaviness to that song,"
39:35;39:36;"but it was kind of fun just, like,"
39:36;39:38;"sitting down after a few months"
39:38;39:39;"when I hadn't thought about it in a while"
39:39;39:40;"and just, like, trying to write a few new verses"
39:40;39:44;"and seeing if this line is better than that line."
39:44;39:45;"But, yeah, totally. I've always--"
39:45;39:50;"I think I want to do a tour sometime."
39:50;39:53;"I mean, the tour we're doing-- about to start,"
39:53;39:55;"which really starts in, like, June."
39:55;39:58;"You know, that's, like-- that's gonna be big."
39:58;40:00;"We've got a seven-piece band again,"
40:00;40:01;"full volume kind of thing."
40:01;40:03;"But at some point, I'd love to do, like--"
40:03;40:05;"maybe not, like, totally an acoustic show,"
40:05;40:08;"but, like, you know, like a quiet tour."
40:08;40:11;"You know, maybe just, like, a week or two."
40:11;40:12;"'Cause, like, a song like that"
40:12;40:14;"would just be so fun just to do stripped down,"
40:14;40:16;"kind of, like, rootsy."
40:16;40:17;"Yeah, we had talked about a--"
40:17;40:20;"the reverse ""stop making sense"" or something,"

40:21;40:23;"stripping something back to get to that."
40:23;40:26;"Yeah, to get to the acoustic at the end."
40:26;40:29;"Yeah, like a long dirge."
40:29;40:30;"Yeah."
40:30;40:33;"Yeah, 'cause all these songs do sound good acoustic."
40:33;40:36;"We did a session recently,"
40:36;40:37;"and I was actually excited to do this,"
40:37;40:40;"'cause I knew Capricorn would sound good,"
40:40;40:42;"acoustic and kind of quiet,"
40:42;40:44;"and classical, too."
40:44;40:45;"Hope would have been great,"
40:45;40:48;"but we just didn't have time to do that one."
40:48;40:50;"And we did a version of ""Peggio."""

52:47;52:49;"Doesn't feel that long ago."
52:49;52:51;"Did you play shows in the States post-pandemic?"
52:51;52:53;"Yes."
52:53;52:55;"But not a tour, but some festivals?"
52:55;52:57;"No, yeah, kind of one-off festivals."
52:57;52:59;"We played--when things were starting to open back up"
52:59;53:01;"late '21, we played"
53:01;53:03;"Outside Lands in San Francisco."
53:03;53:05;"That was a great show."
53:05;53:07;"Then we played some Midwestern festivals"
53:07;53:09;"in Ohio and Indiana."
53:09;53:11;"We played one in Texas."
53:11;53:13;"Yes, we've been all over."
53:13;53:15;"And then we closed it out with, I guess you'd call it"
53:15;53:17;"a mini-tour, Fuji Rock in Japan,"
53:17;53:19;"which ruled."
53:19;53:21;"And then we went to Korea and did"
53:21;53:23;"a Penneport festival."
53:23;53:25;"And did I tell you guys"
53:25;53:27;"that story about when we played there,"
53:27;53:29;"there was a Korean band that played"
53:29;53:31;"before us, and I guess"
53:31;53:33;"they said to the audience,"
53:33;53:35;"""Obviously we don't know."
53:35;53:37;"We don't speak Korean."""
53:37;53:39;"But they said something about--I guess they felt like"
53:39;53:41;"they'd rocked the house so hard that they were just like,"
53:41;53:43;"""Thank you so much."""
53:43;53:45;"And to be fair, whatever, this is their hometown, I think,"
53:45;53:47;"and they were just kind of like, ""Such a dream to play here"
53:47;53:49;"and just close it out. You guys can all go home"
53:49;53:51;"now. You don't need to stay for the next band."""
53:51;53:53;"But of course, we had no idea."
53:53;53:55;"So then, kind of like, just sitting there"
53:55;53:57;"getting ready to go on, and we go on. The crowd was amazing."
53:57;53:59;"Truly the best show we'd ever played"
53:59;54:01;"in Korea. Maybe in all-time"
54:01;54:03;"or anywhere. And then,"
54:03;54:05;"like a day later, somebody sends me this article"
54:05;54:07;"about how the band before"
54:07;54:09;"was like--they got a lot of negative"
54:09;54:11;"comments, like, ""You guys are so rude to Vampire Weekend."""
54:11;54:13;"And they're like, ""We--we--"" But again, all of this"
54:13;54:15;"is in a different language."
54:15;54:17;"So I think they did a post like, ""We apologize to Vampire Weekend."
54:17;54:19;"We were just so excited"
54:19;54:21;"that when we said everybody should go home after us,"
54:21;54:23;"we didn't mean"
54:23;54:25;"any disrespect."
54:25;54:27;"It was just that we felt so hyped."""
54:27;54:29;"But the best part was-- - It's very specific"
54:29;54:31;"directions for the audience."
54:31;54:33;"- ""You should leave."" - ""Go home!"""
54:33;54:35;"- No, maybe they said something even more derogatory, like,"
54:35;54:37;"""You should leave. We've never even heard of the next band."""
54:37;54:39;"Or something. - Wow."
54:39;54:41;"I love it."
54:41;54:43;"- But again, this is why you should learn--"
54:43;54:45;"this is why you should never learn other languages, because"
54:45;54:47;"all this--I was blissfully unaware"
54:47;54:49;"of any of this. Imagine"
54:49;54:51;"if this had been in English. I'd have to go on"
54:51;54:53;"stage and just be like, ""That was"
54:53;54:55;"very rude."" - Yeah."
54:55;54:57;"- And anyway, by the time--"
54:57;54:59;"It's so funny also to hear about--"
54:59;55:01;"I've never quite had an experience like this, where"
55:01;55:03;"somebody sends me an article later,"
55:03;55:05;"and also nobody that I know in the U.S."
55:05;55:07;"is knowing about any of this."
55:07;55:09;"They probably don't even know that we're doing this concert, let alone"
55:09;55:11;"the band who played before us. So anyway,"
55:11;55:13;"just to read an article where somebody's like,"
55:13;55:15;"""This band,"" and then they said this, and"
55:15;55:17;"the next day they apologized. And by the time I'm reading"
55:17;55:19;"all this, I'm like, ""I've left the country."""
55:19;55:21;"Just like, ""What?"""
55:21;55:23;"But anyway, shout-out to that band."
55:23;55:25;"I guess we're even, 'cause I don't know what you're called."
55:25;55:28;"So, you dissed us."
55:29;55:31;"- I literally can't remember you."
55:31;55:33;"- This is the Don Draper moment of"
55:33;55:35;"""I don't think about you"
55:35;55:37;"at all."" But anyway, I wish"
55:37;55:39;"you well. And it was your hometown. You're allowed to diss us."
55:39;55:41;"It's your hometown. You can be a little bit rude."
55:41;55:43;"- So that was your last-- - But if you ever come to"
55:43;55:45;"L.A., you'll be my guest of honor."
55:45;55:47;"I'll take you all around."
55:47;55:49;"But"
55:49;55:51;"that was our last show. And truly,"
55:51;55:53;"that was a great show. That was a great show."
55:53;55:55;"So whatever they said, the audience"
55:55;55:57;"wasn't swayed. It was an amazing audience."
55:57;55:59;"And then, yeah,"
55:59;56:01;"so that was a year and a half ago."
56:01;56:03;"Which, again, Vampire Weekend's gone four years"
56:03;56:05;"without playing shows, so this doesn't feel that long."
56:05;56:07;"We've been rehearsing a bunch."
56:07;56:09;"But, yeah,"
56:09;56:11;"this is-- in some ways, this is kind of like a"
56:11;56:13;"big show to start with."
56:13;56:15;"- Huge. - If you asked me, like, a year ago, I'd be like,"
56:15;56:17;"""Yeah, we'll probably-- maybe we'll do some"
56:17;56:19;"warm-up gigs, play a club show,"
56:19;56:21;"an El Paso"
56:21;56:23;"on the way over."" - The Ohio show"
56:23;56:25;"was probably your kickoff."
56:25;56:27;"- Yeah, it was a little bit smaller for Father of the Bride."
56:27;56:29;"But, you know what, this is outdoors."
56:29;56:31;"It's a unique situation."
56:31;56:33;"We've got so many, like,"
56:33;56:35;"friends in town."
56:35;56:37;"So I can tell you--"
56:37;56:39;"I guess I can tell you guys now, because"
56:39;56:41;"by the time this airs, the show will happen."
56:41;56:43;"We got special guests."
56:43;56:45;"You know what's interesting?"
56:45;56:47;"Both of our special guests"
56:47;56:49;"are Francophone. You want to guess?"
56:49;56:51;"- They're Francophone? - Yeah."
56:51;56:53;"- Wait, what do you mean? I know one of them. - Let's see."
56:53;56:55;"- They're fans of the French?"
56:55;56:57;"- No, that's Francophiles."
56:57;56:59;"- Oh, Francophone. - These are French."
56:59;57:01;"- No, no, these are-- as Nick said before, they're"
57:01;57:03;"umbrophile Francophones."
57:03;57:05;"- Wow. - 'Cause umbrophiles-- - They just"
57:05;57:07;"happen to be here for the eclipse."
57:07;57:09;"- They're umbrophile Francophones."
57:09;57:11;"- Tomas, friend of the show."
57:11;57:13;"- Friend of the show, Tomas from Phoenix."
57:13;57:15;"He's gonna come-- 'cause you know we did that song together."
57:15;57:17;"- Right, right. - Never performed it live."
57:17;57:19;"And, uh,"
57:19;57:21;"he has invited me to perform with Phoenix"
57:21;57:23;"before, but it never quite made sense, so"
57:23;57:25;"for better or for worse, the first"
57:25;57:27;"version performed will be with the dubs."
57:27;57:29;"It'll sound a little different."
57:29;57:31;"So that's one. - Okay, let me think here."
57:31;57:33;"The other..."
57:33;57:35;"- They've all been guests on Time Crisis,"
57:35;57:37;"by the way. - Oh, really? - Yeah."
57:37;57:39;"- I'm gonna guess"
57:39;57:41;"Dave1, but"
57:41;57:43;"you wouldn't call him a Francophone, 'cause"
57:43;57:45;"he's French-Canadian. - No, of course he--"
57:45;57:47;"that is Dave1. Of course he's Francophone."
57:47;57:49;"- Wait, sorry, what does Francophone mean? - I mean, don't get mad--"
57:49;57:51;"don't get mad at me about it. I'm just-- - What?"
57:51;57:53;"- I just-- I'm just trying to clarify."
57:53;57:55;"Would you say someone is-- - Francophone is if you speak"
57:55;57:57;"French. - If you speak French. - Oh, if you--"
57:57;57:59;"yes, yes, he speaks French. - I see."
57:59;58:01;"Okay, cool, so Dave-- - He's a--"
58:01;58:03;"and he might be a Francophile, too."
58:03;58:05;"- I bet he is. - But-- [laughs]"
58:05;58:07;"But I don't know about that. - Okay, so Tom--"
58:07;58:09;"- And is he a numberphone?"
58:09;58:11;"We'll find out if he's a numberphone. - I bet he is."
58:11;58:13;"Is Dave gonna sing a Vampire Weekend song, or-- - No, we're gonna do"
58:13;58:15;"a Chromia song. No, but Dave's first language is"
58:15;58:17;"French. - Yes, yes. - He grew up speaking French at home."
58:17;58:19;"So I guess you'd call somebody Francophone"
58:19;58:21;"even if French was their second language."
58:21;58:23;"But these are two guys whose"
58:23;58:25;"first language is French. - Makes perfect sense"
58:25;58:27;"in Texas. - Well, also,"
58:27;58:29;"Dave, we talked about the fact, you know, that"
58:29;58:31;"there was six flags over Texas, right?"
58:31;58:33;"- Sorry, what?"
58:33;58:35;"- Have we-- - There was six flags"
58:35;58:37;"over-- - Yeah. There were six"
58:37;58:39;"flags over Texas."
58:39;58:41;"You know about this thing? - No, not Magic Mountain."
58:41;58:43;"- Well, okay, you know why it's called"
58:43;58:45;"Six Flags? - No."
58:45;58:47;"- Because the first one is from Texas."
58:47;58:49;"And there were six flags over Texas."
58:49;58:51;"- I don't understand the phrase"
58:51;58:53;"that you're saying right now."
58:53;58:55;"There were six flags over Texas. - So I assume"
58:55;58:57;"that there was a point where there were six different--"
58:57;58:59;"there's somehow--"
58:59;59:01;"there's-- you're gonna say"
59:01;59:03;"a French flag over Texas? - Okay, you know Texas,"
59:03;59:05;"the state? - Yes. - Over it?"
59:05;59:07;"Six flags. - Okay."
59:07;59:09;"End of the episode. - Can I be any clearer?"
59:09;59:11;"You're saying once there was a Mexican flag,"
59:11;59:13;"there's a United States flag. - Yes."
59:13;59:15;"- French flag. - French?"
59:15;59:17;"- Spanish. - That's the one that people always forget."
59:17;59:19;"- Spanish. - Okay, hold on. I always--"
59:19;59:21;"I've done this so many times in my life. - Portuguese."
59:21;59:23;"- There's probably somebody in this room who grew up in Texas"
59:23;59:25;"and actually did Texas history curriculum in middle school."
59:25;59:27;"- Yeah. - Meanwhile,"
59:27;59:29;"you know, you're learning about Connecticut history. How many flags"
59:29;59:31;"were there over Connecticut?"
59:31;59:33;"- Two? - Great Britain."
59:33;59:35;"United States. - Yeah, and you know that amusement park from Connecticut?"
59:35;59:37;"Two flags?"
59:37;59:39;"- That's the origin of Six Flags? - Yeah."
59:39;59:41;"- I didn't know that. - Okay. - That's so cool."
59:41;59:43;"- Okay, let's do our best. - A little history lesson."
59:43;59:45;"- Yeah, so that's a phrase that"
59:45;59:47;"people who know Texas history know,"
59:47;59:49;"is that there are six flags over Texas."
59:49;59:51;"And that's why this amusement park,"
59:51;59:53;"which started in Texas, called Six Flags."
59:53;59:55;"By the time you get to Six Flags Magic Mountain"
59:55;59:57;"or in California, and then the fact--"
59:57;59:59;"you know, it's bizarre, 'cause like,"
59:59;01:00:01;"does the average Californian"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"know that? But the six flags--"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"okay, let's go through them. Let's see if we can get them."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"There's Mexico."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"U.S.A."
01:00:09;01:00:11;"- Spain. - Spain."
01:00:11;01:00:13;"And I believe England and France."
01:00:13;01:00:15;"France is like the random one that you forget about."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"And then the six would be--"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"- Well, obviously, France had"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"like the east, you know,"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"like Louisiana and stuff. I wonder if they had"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"like a chunk of eastern Texas."
01:00:25;01:00:27;"- Must have been. - Right. - And then the six,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"of course, is the independent"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"Republic of Texas."
01:00:31;01:00:33;"- Yep. - For real? - Yeah, Texas was"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"Indy. You didn't know that?"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"- I think I did. I don't know. I don't-- - I mean, it sounds"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"familiar, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's what"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"the flag is from, right?"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"- Yeah. - Is that the Alamo? Okay, this is dumb."
01:00:43;01:00:45;"- And by the way, it was not England."
01:00:45;01:00:47;"It's the Confederacy. - Ah."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"- Oh, so actually, if it was England, that means seven"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"flags. - But there was no England. - They should change that."
01:00:51;01:00:53;"But what if there was?"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"Okay, all right. Okay,"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"so no England. - Seven flags was enough to tell us. - No England."
01:00:57;01:00:59;"- No England. - Okay, so"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"Mexico, America, Spain,"
01:01:01;01:01:03;"France, Confederacy,"
01:01:03;01:01:05;"Indy."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"- Did you say United States?"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- Independent Republic of Texas."
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Those are the six flags. - Did you"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"say the US flag? - And one"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"more time from the top. - Hold on."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"- Mexico, USA,"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"Spain,"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"France, Confederacy,"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"- Republic of Texas. - Independent"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"Republic of Texas, and we're gonna put an"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"asterisk on England, 'cause no one knows for sure."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"But yeah, but those"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"are the six. - How did we"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"get on that? - And the seventh is a"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Pantera flag. - Sick."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- Just hangin' some"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"Hesher dudes."
01:01:39;01:01:41;"Bedroom. Okay, no, but that's where"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"the six, okay, but all I'm saying is"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"as we go through them,"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"now that we've discussed the six flags over in Texas,"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"France is the odd man out."
01:01:49;01:01:51;"- Yes, of course. - That's the one that you're like, ""What?"""
01:01:51;01:01:53;"So anyway, here we are."
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Here we are in New France."
01:01:55;01:01:57;"In former New France."
01:01:57;01:01:59;"And we've got two francophone"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"umbrophiles, and that's how"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"I'm gonna introduce them. - I think you should."
01:02:03;01:02:05;"- Okay, so-- - Your forgotten flag."
01:02:05;01:02:07;"- Okay, also there's been some rumors we might get some"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"francophone umbrophiles out here tonight"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"in former New France."
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Crowd goes nuts."
01:02:13;01:02:15;"Here's the first one."
01:02:15;01:02:17;"You know who it-- oh!"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"Anyway, and actually,"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"we're gonna do those songs back-to-back, so I was wondering"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"if at some point"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"before Thomas leaves the stage"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"and Dave comes out, I say, ""Thomas, hang a second,"""
01:02:27;01:02:29;"and then Dave comes, and I say, ""Come on, guys,"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"speak French to each other for a second."""
01:02:31;01:02:33;"- Just speak French. - It's like,"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"""Ca va? Ca va bien?"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"D'accord."""
01:02:37;01:02:39;"I don't know. Anyway, that's"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"just a coincidence. And then we got"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"Brian Jones gonna come rip a"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"solo. - Oh, nice."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"- And uh-- - Come rip a solo."
01:02:47;01:02:49;"- And we also just got some fun-- you'll hear some--"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"even some of the old material you'll hear radically"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"recontextualized as we do. - Nice. Right."
01:02:53;01:02:55;"- So it's gonna be great. It's gonna be a mix of old and new,"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"and we'll see how the weather goes, but I'm excited"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"and I'm glad that while"

01:03:07;01:03:09;"You'll be covering-- got TC on"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"the scene covering-- - Mixing up with the people backstage."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"We're gonna figure something out."
01:03:13;01:03:15;"- During the show, I'll be watching the show."

01:03:17;01:03:19;"business during the show."
01:03:19;01:03:21;"- Appreciate that. Okay, but before the show,"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"maybe when I'm soundchecking,"
01:03:23;01:03:25;"you guys-- - Yeah."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- Maybe we'll do some man on the street. - Maybe you could score"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"an interview with a Francophone umbrophile."
01:03:29;01:03:31;"- Mm. - At least one of them."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"Yeah, and maybe just some random people."
01:03:33;01:03:35;"- Love to hear about-- is it-- wait, is it"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Tomas? How do you say his name? Toma?"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"- I always say Toma. - I'd love to hear"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"what his relationship is with"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"music from Texas. - With the great state of Texas."

01:09:27;01:09:29;"- Diane Young. - Diane Young."
01:09:29;01:09:32;"So you've been in two Vampire Weekend music videos"

01:09:37;01:09:39;"Did you have a better experience the first time,"
01:09:39;01:09:41;"which was more of a group or an ensemble thing,"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"or did you like the second one more?"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"- I think I liked the first one more."
01:09:45;01:09:47;"The idea was that I was smoking weed"
01:09:47;01:09:50;"out of a saxophone, and I would blow it,"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"and I would put it in Sky Ferreira's face, I think,"
01:09:53;01:09:56;"and piss her off and make her leave the dinner table."
01:09:56;01:09:58;"That was just, like, a more fun narrative"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"than a guy driving a car."
01:10:00;01:10:02;"- Yeah, I guess so, and you could be"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"with the whole extended family."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Anyway, I've just taken over this mic."
01:10:06;01:10:08;"That wasn't the plan here. Nick, Nick, you take it."
01:10:08;01:10:10;"- So did you like the video?"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"- Yes. - That's the right answer."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"[laughter]"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"- It's good."
01:10:17;01:10:19;"- How was your flight yesterday, Despot?"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"- Well, I'm glad you asked."
01:10:21;01:10:23;"First of all, there was no Wi-Fi,"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"which is of no consequence to me, really."
01:10:25;01:10:28;"- Obviously. - But people were upset about that."
01:10:28;01:10:30;"I had a thought while I was on the plane,"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"like, there might be, you know,"
01:10:32;01:10:35;"Vampire Weekend heads coming from New York"
01:10:35;01:10:37;"to Austin for this show,"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"and what if they see me on the plane,"
01:10:39;01:10:42;"and I'm doing something that I'm not supposed to be doing?"
01:10:42;01:10:45;"Like, what if I--what if my screen was on?"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"If it was, it wouldn't be because I did it."
01:10:47;01:10:49;"It would have been, like, someone else turned it on,"
01:10:49;01:10:51;"or, you know, it automatically came on,"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"which didn't happen. The screen was off."
01:10:53;01:10:55;"But I had a book with me,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"and I was thinking about reading the book."
01:10:57;01:10:59;"- Uh-oh. - But I was like,"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"if I read this book and somebody sees me,"
01:11:01;01:11:04;"that just, you know, shatters the myth,"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"which is not a myth, the truth."
01:11:06;01:11:08;"It shatters the truth. So I did it."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"- You have a reputation to uphold."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"- Yeah, exactly. - The guy that stares"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"in front of the seat in front of him."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"- Yeah, and on that flight specifically,"
01:11:16;01:11:19;"there's a danger of, you know, tarnishing that reputation."
01:11:19;01:11:21;"So I stared at the screen,"
01:11:21;01:11:23;"and I slept here and there,"
01:11:23;01:11:25;"and that's it. That's what I do."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"- This didn't come up on the last show,"
01:11:27;01:11:29;"but you know there's a Seinfeld character"
01:11:29;01:11:32;"who's known for doing exactly that type of plane behavior."
01:11:32;01:11:34;"David Putty, Lane's boyfriend. - Yes."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"- How do you feel about being associated with that character?"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"- If I'm being honest, I don't really remember"
01:11:39;01:11:42;"anything else about him, but I do remember that."
01:11:42;01:11:45;"- Arby's fan. - He was an Arby's fan?"
01:11:45;01:11:48;"- Yeah, he's thinking Arby's. He always wants to go out to Arby's."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"- By my high school, there was an Arby's."
01:11:50;01:11:53;"I went to [bleep] school in the West Village,"
01:11:53;01:11:55;"and there was an Arby's on 6th Avenue,"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"and that's maybe the only time in my life"
01:11:57;01:11:59;"I've ever eaten Arby's, but I would say"
01:11:59;01:12:02;"throughout high school, I probably ate Arby's"
01:12:02;01:12:05;"at least four times."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"It's not good. - Nick, you ever eat at Arby's?"
01:12:07;01:12:10;"You guys eat at Arby's? - I feel like I've mentioned this."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"Nick has a weird connection to Arby's that"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"this seems appropriate for the show."
01:12:14;01:12:19;"And it might be something I've brought up on the thread, maybe,"
01:12:19;01:12:23;"that my great-great-uncle invented Arby's."
01:12:23;01:12:25;"- Nah. - For Macaroni and Oatmeal, yes."
01:12:25;01:12:28;"- Is his name Arby? - No, his name is not Arby."
01:12:28;01:12:32;"But it's also Arby's as-- - This is a major TC lid blower."
01:12:32;01:12:36;"- So, well, first of all, Arby's is not a name."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"It is supposed to be Arby-- they spell it out,"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"but it's Ar-bee for roast beef."
01:12:40;01:12:42;"- Oh. [laughs]"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"- I mean, that-- - Wow."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"- I think someone told me that once, and I forgot."
01:12:46;01:12:49;"And now I'm reminded. - Now you know."
01:12:49;01:12:52;"- It's very clever. - So my great-uncle--"
01:12:52;01:12:56;"- Started Arby's? - Started Arby's in Ohio,"
01:12:56;01:12:59;"outside of Akron. - What was his name?"
01:12:59;01:13:01;"- This is a story that's-- I actually can't remember."
01:13:01;01:13:03;"I haven't looked up-- I've sent it to the thread."
01:13:03;01:13:05;"- I'll find it out. - Because, yeah, you can look it up."
01:13:05;01:13:08;"And it was him and his brother. It was two brothers."
01:13:08;01:13:10;"- This is some corporate food history. - Corporate food history."
01:13:10;01:13:12;"I didn't expect to-- I didn't know we'd be talking about Arby's"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"or I would have been more prepared."
01:13:14;01:13:17;"But sort of family lore is that they created Arby's"
01:13:17;01:13:20;"and then didn't make much money off of it."
01:13:20;01:13:22;"You know, they sold it, and then it scaled up."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"And then it franchised out. - Oh, wow."
01:13:24;01:13:26;"- Yes. - Leroy Raffel."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"- Yes. Leroy-- - Raffel, like raffle ticket?"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"- Yes, R-- - It's spelled slightly different."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"It's an E-L. So is that Raf-el?"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"- Raf-- [laughs] - Leroy Raffel."
01:13:34;01:13:36;"- I think it's Raf-el. - With his brother, right?"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"I believe it was him and his brother."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"- Forrest and Leroy Raffel. - Forrest and Leroy Raffel."
01:13:41;01:13:45;"- Yeah. So they were my great-uncle on my father's side."
01:13:45;01:13:47;"And they created Arby's. - Wow."
01:13:47;01:13:51;"- And then they were in some financial straits,"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"sold it, and then it really scaled up."
01:13:53;01:13:57;"And it got franchised out, so they never really saw any of that."
01:13:57;01:13:59;"- The Wright brothers, the fast food."
01:13:59;01:14:01;"- Yeah. - Gonna look up net worth now."
01:14:01;01:14:04;"- The Wright brothers-- - I think they're dead."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"- Yeah, Leroy just died. He died last year."
01:14:07;01:14:09;"- Ohio greatness. Arby's and the Wright brothers."
01:14:09;01:14:12;"- Oh, that's right. This is obviously not family I'm that close with."
01:14:12;01:14:15;"I don't talk to a lot of my Ohio side of the family."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"But it was my father's uncle."
01:14:17;01:14:23;"- What about everyone's favorite moon-based album or song?"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"I'm gonna start-- I'm gonna say ""Bad Moon Rising"" by Credence."
01:14:26;01:14:30;"- What about a group? - Yeah, I would say ""Marquee Moon."""
01:14:30;01:14:33;"- Pretty thick cloud cover here today. - Yeah."
01:14:33;01:14:37;"- Not boating well for the eclipse."
01:14:37;01:14:40;"- I've been refreshing the weather app. - Yeah?"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- Yeah, it's a little-- - But it's more about a feeling, I think."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"- I know. It is what it is. - It's a feeling."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"- And the sky is still gonna turn, like, black, right?"
01:14:46;01:14:47;"- Yeah, it's-- - No."
01:14:47;01:14:49;"- No? - It's an uncanny light."
01:14:49;01:14:51;"- It's gonna be nighttime. - It's not--"
01:14:51;01:14:53;"It's an uncanny light. It doesn't--"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"It doesn't turn pitch black. We covered this on the show."
01:14:56;01:14:59;"- I know. I still haven't detertilized it. - Right."
01:14:59;01:15:02;"- ""Marquee Moon."" You can go back. There's nothing wrong with it."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"- It's a good one. - There you go."

01:17:13;01:17:15;"- I don't know."
01:17:15;01:17:17;"- It was ""Flaming Hot."""
01:17:17;01:17:19;"- Not a fan. Not a true fan."

01:21:56;01:21:59;"We've just run into a friend of the show,"
01:21:59;01:22:02;"Holly McLaren, like the car, right?"
01:22:02;01:22:05;"Yeah, just like the car. It's still different, but still the same."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"Holly McLaren, you have a unique position with the TC Universe, but why is that?"
01:22:08;01:22:13;"I run the Time Crisis Universe Wiki, so if you need to know anything about time crisis"
01:22:13;01:22:17;"or the Time Crisis Universe, go to tcwiki.fandom.com"
01:22:17;01:22:20;"and you'll find out everything you need to know."
01:22:20;01:22:23;"That's so cool. Thank you for your service. Thank you for doing that."
01:22:23;01:22:27;"Because, you know, on the show, when we need to look up facts about the show,"
01:22:27;01:22:32;"we will refer to the... You are the true source of truth for the show."
01:22:32;01:22:35;"Sure, yeah. I provide the numbers for the #crunch."
01:22:35;01:22:39;"That's right. There would be no #crunch without you."
01:22:39;01:22:43;"Tell me about the impetus for starting the whole Wiki."
01:22:43;01:22:47;"Do you remember what was going on and do you remember the first thing that you posted?"
01:22:47;01:22:53;"Yeah, so I got into TC in 2018 and I was on the subreddit"
01:22:53;01:22:57;"and it seemed like every single day someone was like, ""What episode is Lonnie's dad?"""
01:22:57;01:22:59;"Like, ""What episode is this joke from?"""
01:22:59;01:23:03;"And it really felt like there was a need for a Wiki in the fandom."
01:23:03;01:23:06;"So, yeah, I built it pretty much."
01:23:06;01:23:09;"Someone had kind of built out a very loose foundation"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"and I just kind of took that and ran with it."
01:23:11;01:23:14;"And, yeah, it's been great. I do it for the fans. It's a labor of love."
01:23:14;01:23:18;"So let me ask you a question. Now you are a part of the show,"
01:23:18;01:23:22;"which means that at a certain point you are going to be recapping a show"
01:23:22;01:23:25;"and you're going to have to refer to yourself as a guest of the show"
01:23:25;01:23:30;"and you're going to also have to refer to yourself potentially on future episodes as a callback."
01:23:30;01:23:34;"Is this getting too insular? How do you feel? It's very meta at this point."
01:23:34;01:23:39;"It is pretty meta, but I think callbacks and self-referential humor"
01:23:39;01:23:42;"is kind of like one of the core tenets of Time Crisis."
01:23:42;01:23:45;"Not a core value. Yeah, I want to make that distinction."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"But, yeah, I feel it's pretty integral to the show."
01:23:48;01:23:51;"I just want to introduce you to Jake. Can I just--"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"Yeah, sure."
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake, this is Holly."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Holly runs the TCU Wiki."
01:23:56;01:23:57;"Oh, wow."
01:23:57;01:23:58;"That we offer."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"Yeah, just doing a quick interview with her."
01:24:00;01:24:04;"But I thought, you know, since she's provided such a source of reference for the show,"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"I thought you two should meet."
01:24:06;01:24:08;"Outstanding. Lovely to meet you."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Yeah, nice to meet you in person."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Is that the Wikipedia page or that's a separate--"
01:24:12;01:24:16;"That's the TC-- Sorry. A little technical. Yeah, I thought it was different."
01:24:16;01:24:21;"Yeah, there is a Wikipedia page for Time Crisis,"
01:24:21;01:24:24;"but I run-- It's a different website, pretty much,"
01:24:24;01:24:28;"but it's like Wikipedia for Time Crisis."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"So, Wiki-- Because Wiki is not exclusive to Wikipedia."
01:24:31;01:24:35;"There can be other Wiki pages that live off--"
01:24:35;01:24:38;"I mean, I'm not an expert on this myself, but am I correct?"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"Yeah, that's about it. Yeah."
01:24:40;01:24:44;"But did it start with Wikipedia and then other people did the offshoot?"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Now I'm just getting into the etymology of it."
01:24:46;01:24:52;"Yeah, I did study linguistics, but I'm not familiar with the etymology of the term ""Wiki,"""
01:24:52;01:24:54;"but that's probably right."
01:24:54;01:24:59;"This just feels like something I should be number crunching if I didn't have my hands full."
01:24:59;01:25:01;"Holly, thanks for talking to us."
01:25:01;01:25:04;"I'm so glad that you could be now on the show that you write about."
01:25:04;01:25:06;"Yeah, I mean, great to meet you guys."
01:25:06;01:25:10;"It's a cool vibe, like putting usernames to faces and everything like that."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"Yeah, it's a good time. I hope you guys have an awesome time."

01:29:46;01:29:51;"In 2023, Time Crisis picked the movie of the year. What was that movie?"
01:29:51;01:29:54;"- Flamin' Hot. - Ding, ding, ding. 2 out of 3."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"So here's your prize for getting 2 out of 3. You get a lighter."
01:29:57;01:30:00;"- Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Thanks for playing, Parker."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"- Thank you for playing, Parker. - Cheers, guys. Thank you."
01:30:02;01:30:04;"- Nice to meet you guys. - Nice to meet you."
01:34:10;01:34:16;"So we're here with Alexander, the man behind the Lord Hathaway jerseys."
01:34:16;01:34:20;"Quite a few people on the grounds this afternoon are sporting."
01:34:20;01:34:23;"- Outstanding clothing item. - Thank you. I appreciate it."
01:34:23;01:34:26;"We're gonna have Max, because clearly you're a TC head."
01:34:26;01:34:30;"- Huge. - We're gonna have Max, Nick's son,"
01:34:30;01:34:35;"ask you three trivia questions. And if you get all three, you get a prize."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"- Okay. - So come on over."
01:34:37;01:34:41;"What is the name of Jake Longstress' Grateful Dead cover band?"
01:34:41;01:34:44;"- Richard Pictures. - Ding, ding, ding. All right."
01:34:44;01:34:46;"- Easy. - You got 1 out of 3. All right."
01:34:46;01:34:51;"So what is Jake Longstress' favorite band?"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"- Hmm. - Tough one."
01:34:54;01:34:58;"- I mean, it's between two, but-- - You can name both, and if you get one right--"
01:34:58;01:35:01;"I was gonna say Grateful Dead or the Eagles."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"- Oh, Guided by Voices. - Yes, thank you."
01:35:03;01:35:06;"- I'm done. Okay. Took me a second. - All right."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"- For my third question. - Okay."
01:35:08;01:35:13;"What author did Time Crisis interview that wrote a book on the Manson murders?"
01:35:13;01:35:16;"- Tom O'Neill. - Wow. - Ding, ding, ding. All three right."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"All right, so I noticed you're wearing--"
01:35:18;01:35:22;"are these homemade Vampire Weekend Eclipse goggles?"
01:35:22;01:35:26;"I did not make them, but they are-- someone homemade them, yes."
01:35:26;01:35:29;"- Where did you get them? - So there was a fan meetup yesterday"
01:35:29;01:35:33;"in Butler Park in downtown Austin for TC Heads, organized by the Dog."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"Shout out the Dog."
01:35:35;01:35:42;"And I met probably 40 other TC Heads, and a pretty incredible experience."
01:35:42;01:35:47;"- I heard Winter is in town. - Winter is in town, and he was there."
01:35:47;01:35:51;"Is he considered a fan, or is he sort of a special guest?"
01:35:51;01:35:57;"He's above Platinum Elite status. He's top TC tier."
01:35:57;01:35:59;"- Royalty. - Yeah, TC royalty."
01:35:59;01:36:04;"What did you guys talk about? Just TC? Just throughout?"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Just merch. I mean, the whole thing was like it was a swap meet,"
01:36:07;01:36:10;"so everybody brought their merch, and you exchanged merch items."
01:36:10;01:36:12;"- This sounds great. - Yeah, it's awesome."
01:36:12;01:36:14;"What'd you get? What'd you walk away with?"
01:36:14;01:36:18;"I got a copy of the New York Daily News from the album release day,"
01:36:18;01:36:24;"and some postcards that someone made, and some stickers, and a pin."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"Where did you travel from?"
01:36:26;01:36:30;"So I live in Nashville. I'm from Memphis. I came here with my cousin."
01:36:30;01:36:34;"So drove a total of like 13 hours to be here."
01:36:34;01:36:36;"- Is your cousin a fan of TC? - Yes."
01:36:36;01:36:42;"And he actually is the one that introduced me to Vampire Weekend after MVOTC in 2013."
01:36:42;01:36:44;"Incredible. This is great."
01:36:44;01:36:50;"And what's your favorite-- so I assume you rushed to listen to the new album."
01:36:50;01:36:55;"Yes. So I actually-- I have a turntable at home,"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"but one of my roommates broke the needle,"
01:36:58;01:37:01;"and so I literally went and got a new turntable the Thursday"
01:37:01;01:37:03;"because my album got there a day early."
01:37:03;01:37:07;"So I literally got a turntable that morning to listen to the album like 8 hours early."
01:37:07;01:37:09;"What's your favorite song on the album?"
01:37:09;01:37:11;"I gotta go with ""Crap School Gangsters."""

01:40:31;01:40:36;"Winter, the king of Starbucks."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"Thanks for coming to Austin."
01:40:37;01:40:38;"Absolutely."
01:40:38;01:40:39;"Well, you know I went to school here, right?"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"I did not know that."
01:40:40;01:40:44;"And my father's house is in Houston, so I kind of had to come."
01:40:44;01:40:45;"Absolutely."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Did you do any Starbucks in the last day or two?"
01:40:47;01:40:48;"I did."
01:40:48;01:40:53;"I took a roundabout route that took me all the way down into Mexico, one of the border towns, Reynosa,"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"and then all the way up here."
01:40:55;01:40:58;"And then I did a bunch of independent coffee shops on the way."
01:40:58;01:40:59;"So it's been great."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"It's been a wonderful can't-lose weekend."
01:41:02;01:41:08;"But here's the greatest thing, is that, believe it or not, my greatest worry when I went for my six-month global tour"
01:41:08;01:41:14;"was that Vampire would release their album while I was on tour and go on tour."
01:41:14;01:41:15;"And I'd miss it."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"But the timing worked out."
01:41:17;01:41:23;"I haven't even been back in the U.S. for one month, and already I get to see this album release show."
01:41:23;01:41:24;"This is awesome."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"Some would say it's cosmic."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"Absolutely."
01:41:28;01:41:33;"What is your favorite moon-based song or album?"
01:41:33;01:41:35;"Moon-based song?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Moon reference."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"The first one that comes to mind is ""Dark Side of the Moon."""
01:41:38;01:41:43;"I would be hard-pressed to name a second moon-based song."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Honestly, I can't think of one."
01:41:45;01:41:47;"""Bad Moon Rising"" by Credence."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"That's a good song."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Yeah, yeah."
01:41:50;01:41:53;"""Marquee Moon"" by Television."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"I could do this all day."
01:41:54;01:41:57;"Yeah, my music knowledge is not as deep as you all."
01:41:57;01:42:02;"That's why I could never really be a part of the Crisis crew, because I don't have the bench."
01:42:02;01:42:04;"I don't have the background knowledge."
01:42:04;01:42:06;"Well, you're an expert in other fields."
01:42:06;01:42:07;"I guess we all have our own..."
01:42:07;01:42:10;"What's going on with the Starbucks Corporation? What's the latest?"
01:42:10;01:42:12;"The latest is the kind of good news."
01:42:12;01:42:15;"They're actually talking to the union now."
01:42:15;01:42:16;"Oh, interesting."
01:42:16;01:42:20;"One of the last times you had me on, I was talking about their union-busting efforts, right?"
01:42:20;01:42:21;"Uh-huh, yeah."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"So it looks like they've kind of reversed course on that."
01:42:24;01:42:33;"But, you know, I try to be diplomatic about this, but I just posted on Reddit about the en****cation of Starbucks,"
01:42:33;01:42:37;"based on a book that came out last year about the en****cation of the internet."
01:42:37;01:42:38;"Uh-huh."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"Really good book by Cory Doctaro."
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Okay."
01:42:41;01:42:46;"But, you know, I get back from all these wonderful experiences overseas, 42 different countries,"
01:42:46;01:42:52;"and then I get back to the US, and consistently I have all these negative experiences at Starbucks."
01:42:52;01:42:55;"Like, the customer service doesn't seem to be up there."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"They're putting in these faucets that don't work."
01:42:58;01:43:01;"They purposely degraded the Wi-Fi."
01:43:01;01:43:06;"And I post on Reddit, and everybody else is commenting, ""Yeah, I've noticed the same thing. It's just getting worse."""
01:43:06;01:43:09;"So morale is low in the United States."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"You go to Japan, it's terrific."
01:43:12;01:43:19;"You go to the Middle East, the partners there will literally go a mile to make sure that the customer is satisfied."
01:43:19;01:43:25;"Is the union effort company-wide in the United States, or is it just certain stores or certain states?"
01:43:25;01:43:27;"I think it's up to several hundred stores."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"Basically, they have to go one by one."
01:43:29;01:43:30;"Oh my goodness."
01:43:30;01:43:33;"And they have to have a vote, a separate vote for each store, so it's a tedious process."
01:43:33;01:43:34;"Oh my God."
01:43:34;01:43:38;"And then for the first year or so, Starbucks wasn't even bargaining with them,"
01:43:38;01:43:43;"and so that discouraged some stores, and they voted to get out of the union."
01:43:43;01:43:47;"But now that Starbucks is talking to them, it seems like it's picking up momentum,"
01:43:47;01:43:51;"because I see an article every week, I see multiple articles about,"
01:43:51;01:43:55;"""This store in Montana is going to unionize. This store in Texas is going to unionize."""
01:43:55;01:43:57;"So it might be picking up steam again."
01:43:57;01:44:00;"So when you're driving around Starbucking, have you been listening to the new record?"
01:44:00;01:44:04;"I've listened to the new record so many times, plus I have to catch up on the old records,"
01:44:04;01:44:11;"because one of my things about going to concerts is I try to identify the song as quickly as possible."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"But of course, Vampire Weekend is known for changing up the intro."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"True. The arrangements. Right."
01:44:16;01:44:18;"I might not be able to pick it up until the lyrics start,"
01:44:18;01:44:21;"but I still have to know some of the lyrics in order to identify all the songs."
01:44:21;01:44:26;"For Taylor Swift, I made this jokey bet with myself that every time I missed a song,"
01:44:26;01:44:28;"I would cut off a digit."
01:44:28;01:44:29;"That's high stakes."
01:44:29;01:44:32;"Yeah. Fortunately, I didn't go through with that, because I missed a lot of songs."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"What's your favorite song off the new record?"
01:44:34;01:44:40;"Right now, it's Hope, but it could shift over to Prep School Gangsters."
01:44:40;01:44:42;"That one has kind of an old-school feel."
01:44:42;01:44:46;"Ice Cream Parlor is kind of creeping up."
01:44:46;01:44:47;"Ice Cream Piano?"
01:44:47;01:44:48;"Ice Cream Piano."
01:44:48;01:44:50;"I like Ice Cream Parlor."
01:44:50;01:44:51;"That's for the next record."
01:44:51;01:44:52;"Right, right."
01:44:52;01:44:55;"Awesome. Well, dude, it's so cool you made it to Austin."
01:44:55;01:44:57;"I'm just thrilled to be here."
01:44:57;01:44:59;"This was like a weekend filled with so much stuff."
01:44:59;01:45:04;"As long as the world doesn't end when the sun goes out, it's going to be awesome."
01:45:04;01:45:15;"All that you touch and all that you see, all that you taste, all you feel."
01:45:15;01:45:25;"And all that you love and all that you hate, all you distrust, all you say."
01:45:25;01:45:36;"And all that you give and all that you deal, and all that you buy, make, borrow, or steal."
01:45:36;01:45:46;"And all you create and all you destroy, and all that you do and all that you say."
01:45:46;01:45:56;"And all that you eat and everyone you meet, and all that you slight and everyone you fight."
01:45:56;01:46:04;"And all that is now and all that is gone and all that's to come."
01:46:04;01:46:17;"And everything under the sun is in view, but the sun is a great spot on the moon."
01:46:17;01:46:21;"So, Jake, how do you think this has gone so far, being out in the crowd?"
01:46:21;01:46:23;"Oh, it's been good with the interviews, yeah."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"And then--"
01:46:24;01:46:25;"Everybody's liked about it."
01:46:25;01:46:26;"You excited for the show to get started?"
01:46:26;01:46:32;"I'm excited. I haven't seen Vampire since, uh, 2019?"
01:46:32;01:46:34;"Yeah."
01:46:34;01:46:35;"The last time I saw it? Hollywood Bowl?"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"That would be the last time that we saw him. What are your expectations?"
01:46:38;01:46:40;"What are you excited about for this show?"
01:46:40;01:46:48;"Oh, very high expectations. I know they've been, like, really, like, working out hard in the gym and in the practice space."
01:46:48;01:46:54;"So, they just gotta get out there, play the songs as best they can, and I think we're gonna, like, have a good show today."
01:46:54;01:46:57;"Couldn't agree more. You excited about the Eclipse?"
01:46:57;01:47:04;"I've seen an Eclipse before, as we've discussed, and it's cloudy, so I'm a little-- I've muted expectations on the Eclipse. What about you?"
01:47:04;01:47:11;"I haven't seen a total Eclipse, so I have high expectations. I hope that it comes through, but you know what?"
01:47:11;01:47:17;"Either way, we're in Austin, it's Ezra's birthday, and we're at a Vampire Weekend show."
01:47:17;01:47:18;"Yeah."

01:50:40;01:50:44;"Wow, guys, we were backstage here at the Moody Amphitheatre"
01:50:44;01:50:47;"after Vampire Weekend has just destroyed this audience."
01:50:47;01:50:50;"This is MTV Spring Break, and we're just here."
01:50:50;01:50:52;"I don't think we've ever heard Jake have that much energy."
01:50:52;01:50:55;"Yeah, that was Jake at Turn Up to 12."
01:50:55;01:50:58;"I haven't seen them since 2019."
01:50:58;01:51:00;"The boys were on fire tonight."
01:51:00;01:51:02;"It was so fun to be back."
01:51:02;01:51:04;"I love the new members of the band."
01:51:04;01:51:07;"I don't know. There's so much to get through."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"We got a great shot of the eclipse too."
01:51:10;01:51:11;"Yeah, yeah."
01:51:11;01:51:13;"Not to diminish the band, but..."
01:51:13;01:51:15;"It got eerily dark."
01:51:15;01:51:17;"As we've discussed on the show,"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"I was at the Casper, Wyoming eclipse in 2017."
01:51:20;01:51:23;"That was a bright, sunny day. This was pretty overcast."
01:51:23;01:51:26;"This was scarily dark."
01:51:26;01:51:28;"If Casper, Wyoming was an uncanny light,"
01:51:28;01:51:30;"this was a terrifying darkness"
01:51:30;01:51:35;"that set over Austin for a good four to five minutes."
01:51:35;01:51:39;"I definitely stared at it a bunch without the glasses."
01:51:39;01:51:42;"I don't understand what the problem is with looking at the eclipse."
01:51:42;01:51:44;"On a standard day, if you looked at the sun,"
01:51:44;01:51:47;"it's not a good idea, but it's not going to blind you."
01:51:47;01:51:51;"If you stared at it for an extended period, it might."
01:51:51;01:51:56;"But if the eclipse is covered, doesn't it seem less dangerous?"
01:51:56;01:51:59;"There were times where the cloud was covering it, and it felt safe."
01:51:59;01:52:01;"But I do have a crescent shape."
01:52:01;01:52:04;"If I close my eyes, I can see a bit of a crescent."
01:52:04;01:52:06;"Like a bit of a crescent shape."
01:52:06;01:52:08;"But I think it'll go away."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"That's exactly why you don't look at the sun."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"That was hours ago."
01:52:12;01:52:15;"But you did see-- Did you guys both see the vampire--"
01:52:15;01:52:18;"The vampires come out. Did you both see the bats come out?"
01:52:18;01:52:21;"I saw someone tweet about that. Is that real?"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"It's very real."
01:52:23;01:52:25;"There's this bridge not far from here"
01:52:25;01:52:28;"where at night, just millions of bats go,"
01:52:28;01:52:32;"and they're underneath this bridge that's right off the highway over this creek."
01:52:32;01:52:36;"And it's south by southwest, everyone's talking about it, and they'll come out."
01:52:36;01:52:39;"So the question was, would they come out? And we're still kind of far from it."
01:52:39;01:52:44;"But at the vampire weekend show, on the eclipse, the bats released."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Making good on his promise."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"Absolutely."
01:52:47;01:52:52;"I thought the 9-minute flower moon into the eclipse,"
01:52:52;01:52:54;"and then coming out of the eclipse with hope,"
01:52:54;01:52:58;"there was a really nice narrative to that part of the set."
01:52:58;01:53:00;"I'm just being sincere right now."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"As you should."
01:53:01;01:53:06;"That was a great-- I mean, that was such a strong set of choices that were made there."
01:53:06;01:53:09;"I love the 9-minute flower moon. That's a great version."
01:53:09;01:53:11;"Would you say you were emotionally moved?"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"Yeah, I was emotionally moved."
01:53:13;01:53:17;"And also to be at the show with everyone, all our friends,"
01:53:17;01:53:21;"to witness the celestial event, having seen a vampire in five years,"
01:53:21;01:53:24;"it was an emotional moment."
01:53:24;01:53:28;"And then I loved their Texas honky-tonk medley."
01:53:28;01:53:32;"We got some Flying Burrito Brothers, Sin City."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"We got The Grateful Dead, New Minglewood Blues."
01:53:35;01:53:39;"We got-- and then back into Married in the Gold Rush."
01:53:39;01:53:42;"Did you hear that Price is Right interpolation in there?"
01:53:42;01:53:43;"That was pretty cool."
01:53:43;01:53:44;"Missed that."
01:53:44;01:53:45;"[HUMMING]"
01:53:45;01:53:46;"There was a lot going on."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"Yeah."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"They played games."
01:53:48;01:53:49;"They did."
01:53:49;01:53:51;"That's an unusual-- that's an unusual--"
01:53:51;01:53:55;"Yeah, Josh, the guitar tech, was doing cornhole on stage."
01:53:55;01:54:00;"And then they were giving out chocolate bars that were rumored to have $100 bills in them."
01:54:00;01:54:01;"That could be fake news."
01:54:01;01:54:02;"I don't know."
01:54:02;01:54:04;"I'm just reporting what I'm hearing."
01:54:04;01:54:05;"I believe that's true."
01:54:05;01:54:06;"Ezra seemed in great spirits."
01:54:06;01:54:07;"The whole band did."
01:54:07;01:54:10;"The Francophones, they sang ""Happy Birthday."""
01:54:10;01:54:11;"Yes. Oh, that was good."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"That was nice."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"I think Ezra seemed a little maybe bashful about not wanting to--"
01:54:15;01:54:18;"Well, he didn't mention that it was his birthday."
01:54:18;01:54:23;"This is like a fan podcast, like doing media breakdowns."
01:54:23;01:54:28;"Like those dudes that do the Howard Stern po-show."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"To be clear, we--"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"That's what this is right now."
01:54:31;01:54:35;"Yeah, to make no mistake, we do know Ezra in real life."
01:54:35;01:54:36;"Yeah, we do."
01:54:36;01:54:38;"We've met him countless times."
01:54:38;01:54:40;"A handful of times we've actually met him."
01:54:40;01:54:44;"There was the craziest moment when the chocolate bars were being thrown out"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"with the supposed $100 bills in it."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"And then I was like, whoa, pretty Wonka."
01:54:48;01:54:51;"And then one minute later, a dude walked out of the crowd"
01:54:51;01:54:53;"wearing a Willy Wonka t-shirt."
01:54:53;01:54:55;"Shallow May? Like the new Wonka?"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"No, no. Gene Wilder."
01:54:57;01:55:00;"And we were like, Wonka?"
01:55:00;01:55:02;"What are the odds that we would mention Wonka"
01:55:02;01:55:05;"and then a minute later see a Wonka tee?"
01:55:05;01:55:07;"I mean, what are the odds that someone would come here"
01:55:07;01:55:10;"wearing a Wonka tee before even having the Wonka event,"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"then you would make that comment?"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"Then that's like--"
01:55:14;01:55:16;"One in a billion, kind of like an eclipse."
01:55:16;01:55:17;"During an eclipse, too."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"A Willy Wonka eclipse."
01:55:20;01:55:24;"So, after an emotional day, eclipse,"
01:55:24;01:55:28;"Ezra's birthday, return of Vampire Weekend,"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"I think you'd like us to say that"
01:55:31;01:55:33;"Only God Was Above Us is out now."
01:55:33;01:55:37;"Vampire has five albums in stores."
01:55:37;01:55:39;"And that's it. Signing off from Austin."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"See you in two weeks."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Signing off. I'll see you in two weeks."
01:55:43;01:55:49;"Echo on the island, water tunnel three"
01:55:49;01:55:54;"Cage ascending, someone looks like me"
01:55:54;01:55:59;"A couple fingers reaching into space"
01:55:59;01:56:05;"A roaming soldier's spearhead jammed above the waves"
01:56:06;01:56:13;"Oh, oh"
01:56:13;01:56:23;"There is someone speaking, a voice without a face"
01:56:23;01:56:29;"The ocean's churning, the cables stay in place"
01:56:29;01:56:34;"Explorations the locals couldn't save"
01:56:34;01:56:40;"An undercover agent drowned beneath the waves"
01:56:40;01:56:45;"Outside the confines of a supermini's door"
01:56:45;01:56:50;"There's a cat on the key, pierced directly on the floor"
01:56:50;01:56:56;"Oh, the sun can't forget the shell around his neck"
01:56:56;01:57:03;"Underneath fluorescent lights, you never see the starry night she sang"
01:57:03;01:57:29;"(instrumental)"
01:57:29;01:57:35;"Fake fortune teller, scandalized by fate"
01:57:35;01:57:41;"Broke body builder, crushed beneath the weight"
01:57:41;01:57:46;"Lost and deluded, trying to find your place"
01:57:46;01:57:52;"A neck-long distance runner, losing every race"
01:57:52;01:58:21;"(instrumental)"
01:58:21;01:58:38;"(instrumental)"
01:58:38;01:58:43;"Outside the confines of a supermini's door"
01:58:43;01:58:48;"There's a cat on the key, pierced directly on the floor"
01:58:48;01:58:53;"Oh, the sun can't forget the shell around his neck"
01:58:53;01:58:57;"As you were bound beneath fluorescent lights"
01:58:57;01:59:01;"You never see the starry night she sang"
01:59:01;01:59:30;"(instrumental)"
01:59:30;01:59:56;"(instrumental)"
