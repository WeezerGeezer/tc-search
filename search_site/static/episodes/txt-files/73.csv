00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, a very special episode. This week we check in with Sweet Martha to"
00:07;00:13;"find out what's going on in Minnesota. We also compare the top five hits of"
00:13;00:20;"Jake's Birth Year '77 with mine, 1984. All this plus Droga 5, The Rolling"
00:20;00:29;"Stones, and Tobin Sprout and Tim Allen. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:29;00:31;"ABB Sports."
00:31;00:33;"Number one."
01:14;01:21;"Time Crisis back again. This is an early record. We're spiritually live with you"
01:21;01:27;"July 29th but we had to get this one pretty early because I'm in Japan. You're"
01:27;01:30;"playing a show in Japan today? This is a hilarious tour. I mean this is just how"
01:30;01:36;"it is over there. Two week tour, two shows. Wait, really? Yeah, cuz one's in Australia"
01:36;01:41;"one's in Japan. Why only two shows? Why not do four shows in each country? It's a"
01:41;01:45;"hassle. And also you know there's like radius clauses and stuff. Well Australia"
01:45;01:50;"is really crazy because... Radius clauses? Radius. You're not familiar with radius"
01:50;01:56;"clauses? No. Sounds like a guy to buy voices song. Radius clauses! I'm familiar"
01:56;02:01;"with the concept if you go to a town. Yeah. And you're playing like a big venue"
02:01;02:05;"that venue doesn't want you to play like a small secret show the night before."
02:05;02:11;"Right and the exact same thing is true with festivals. Oh festies. Yeah so you think if"
02:11;02:15;"you're gonna play Coachella that you could just do two nights at the Forum"
02:15;02:19;"with impunity? No but maybe you could play a show in like Springfield, Illinois"
02:19;02:26;"like well yeah a few days before. Exactly hence the radius clause. Yeah but you're"
02:26;02:30;"saying the entire country is the radius? No I'm not saying that and I don't even"
02:30;02:35;"know about these two festivals but well okay. You can't play a show in Melbourne"
02:35;02:38;"if you're playing a show in Sydney? They're both difficult countries to tour."
02:38;02:44;"I'm pissed. Australia is funny too because infamously you leave Tuesday"
02:44;02:50;"night from LA you get in Thursday. Whoa. So it's kind of like I'm gonna leave"
02:50;02:54;"Tuesday night on Thursday gonna go link up with the record label play the album"
02:54;03:00;"for some Australians. I guess you gain that day when you go back? Yeah kind of."
03:00;03:06;"That's weird to really truly lose a day. Yep. That's trippy. So already just the"
03:06;03:12;"flight alone is quote-unquote two days. Yeah. Get in go you know hang with the"
03:12;03:16;"label and play the album and stuff then go to the town where the festival is"
03:16;03:20;"called Splendor in the Grass. Kind of like an iconic Australian festival and"
03:20;03:24;"so then we got to go up to Byron because in Australia you gotta fly everywhere."
03:24;03:29;"Right. I remember when we did this like long Australian tour called Groovin' in"
03:29;03:34;"the Moo. Moo? Yeah I think it was a reference to like farm towns. Okay. I was"
03:34;03:38;"super into the festival and the shows getting from place to place was kind of"
03:38;03:41;"brutal because my understanding the way they told us about that this is like on"
03:41;03:44;"the second album or something they were like the cool thing about Groovin' in"
03:44;03:49;"the Moo is like you're going to these kind of off the beaten path Australian"
03:49;03:53;"towns that like normally if somebody just come to do like a whirlwind global"
03:53;03:56;"tour they might just play Sydney and Melbourne that might be it. Unless you're"
03:56;03:59;"like huge in Australia and you book a whole tour around it but this was"
03:59;04:02;"interesting because we were like I remember one place we played was called"
04:02;04:06;"Townsville which we thought was kind of funny. Mm-hmm. Just like sounds so made up."
04:06;04:11;"What up Townsville? Those shows I just remember like the vibe was always like"
04:11;04:17;"play the show, get in the van, two and a half hours back to the hotel, lobby call"
04:17;04:23;"at 7, like another hour to the airport, fly. Wow. I think this is true I feel like"
04:23;04:27;"somebody said this to me it's the same size as the US. Right. Perth is on the"
04:27;04:32;"west coast that's a six-hour flight from the east coast roughly. Yeah. Might be"
04:32;04:35;"wrong a little bit but I think to properly tour Australia which I hope we"
04:35;04:39;"get to do again. Australia is a major Vampire Weekend country. Well I still"
04:39;04:43;"don't understand why you can't I guess I don't understand why you're not playing"
04:43;04:47;"like two or three shows. You know. In the size of the country. Well I think is in"
04:47;04:52;"Australia it's just simply not possible for us in this time frame. Okay I won't"
04:52;04:55;"drill down on it any further. There's also crazy stuff too that's like it"
04:55;05:00;"takes a minute. You know Australia to Japan's a 12-hour flight. That's kind of"
05:00;05:03;"brutal too. Wow. You kind of feel like all right I'm here. Yeah I wouldn't think it"
05:03;05:08;"was that far. That's like going from like LA to like Paris or something. Yeah. Wow."
05:08;05:12;"So there's a lot of flying and then like the gear has to be shipped. That's a"
05:12;05:16;"whole other interesting world. Not on the plane? No you can't bring that on a"
05:16;05:20;"commercial flight. You see all that Vampire Weekend gear? How does it go?"
05:20;05:24;"Vintage amps. Is it like kind of like a. Two drum sets. You're right man. Backdrop."
05:24;05:29;"These are logistics that I'm not privy to. So is this. Pedal boards. Is it getting loaded"
05:29;05:34;"onto like a FedEx or like a some sort of like commercial cargo flight or is it"
05:34;05:38;"going overseas? No it's not going on a boat. It's gotta be on a. It's gotta be a plane."
05:38;05:45;"Boat would be so cool. Dude the boat sank. Yeah. All our gear is gone. On stage at Fuji"
05:45;05:51;"Rock just being like. Do any of the other bands have an acoustic?"
05:58;06:02;"♪ Playing in a traveling band, yeah ♪"

06:42;06:45;"- Yeah, it's gotta be a plan, but as I understand it,"
06:45;06:48;"luckily I don't personally deal with this stuff."
06:48;06:49;"You know, it's like we go on,"
06:49;06:52;"you know, maybe when you're just starting out,"
06:52;06:53;"you might check all your gear."
06:53;06:54;"- Yeah."
06:54;06:55;"- And like borrow a drum set when you get to the venue."
06:55;06:57;"- Right, you just bring your cymbals."
06:57;06:59;"- But when you're doing like a big tour"
06:59;07:02;"and you have set pieces and a lot of gear,"
07:02;07:03;"no, it has to all go together."
07:03;07:06;"So my understanding is that, you know,"
07:06;07:09;"outside of the commercial flights that the humans take,"
07:09;07:10;"there's a whole shadow network of, yeah,"
07:10;07:12;"like global cargo, freighting."
07:12;07:13;"- Yeah."
07:13;07:16;"- And like there's big companies that specialize in this,"
07:16;07:17;"specifically music."
07:17;07:18;"- Really?"
07:18;07:19;"- Yeah."
07:19;07:20;"- Flying musical gear."
07:20;07:22;"- There's a big one called Rocket Cargo."
07:22;07:26;"And one time I was just like browsing vintage clothing"
07:26;07:27;"on Etsy or eBay or something,"
07:27;07:29;"and I came across, it was like,"
07:29;07:32;"""Rolling Stones 1990 Rocket Cargo Tour."""
07:32;07:34;"Like Rocket Cargo made their own jacket"
07:34;07:38;"for a Rolling Stones tour, asking for 250."
07:38;07:40;"- So it was the jacket that the employees"
07:40;07:41;"of Rocket Cargo wore?"
07:41;07:43;"- Something like that, yeah."
07:43;07:47;"- Schlepping the hard cases on and off these cargo planes."
07:47;07:48;"- Yeah."
07:48;07:49;"- Love that."
07:49;07:52;"- I feel like in another life,"
07:52;07:56;"I could see like Jake being like a top man at Rocket Cargo."
07:56;07:57;"- I'll take it."
07:57;07:58;"- Yeah."
07:58;07:59;"It is this funny thing that like,"
07:59;08:01;"obviously we're privileged not to have to think about"
08:01;08:03;"as the musicians, but every once in a while,"
08:03;08:05;"I'll be like talking to our guys and they'll be like,"
08:05;08:08;"""Well, you got an offer to play like a festival in Ireland,"
08:08;08:10;"but it's the day before, you know, this other festival."""
08:10;08:13;"And I'm like, ""All right, so is it doable?"""
08:13;08:15;"He's like, ""We can get you guys there."""
08:15;08:17;"Logistically, there's like a ferry involved"
08:17;08:21;"and the gear, you know, it could be a little touch and go."
08:21;08:23;"- The gear might not be there."
08:23;08:25;"- Or like one time, one of our touring guys,"
08:25;08:27;"and they know this (beep) inside and out."
08:27;08:28;"And it is a very interesting world."
08:28;08:30;"It was like just telling me about the routing"
08:30;08:32;"of like somebody else's tour."
08:32;08:34;"Like let's say it was like Chili Peppers in South America."
08:34;08:37;"And he was like, ""They did like some ambitious freighting."""
08:37;08:38;"(laughing)"
08:38;08:43;"They did Bogota, you know, and Buenos Aires back to back."
08:43;08:44;"That's a very ambitious freighting."
08:44;08:45;"It's so (beep)"
08:45;08:46;"- Yeah, yeah."
08:46;08:47;"- And I'm sure it's true."
08:47;08:48;"Like that's the, you know,"
08:48;08:50;"it takes a lot to put these shows on."
09:08;09:34;"- Yeah, I mean, I used to work in art museums and stuff"
09:34;09:36;"and that's a whole other world,"
09:36;09:39;"just like the back of house stuff, like the crating."
09:39;09:40;"- I always think about that."
09:40;09:44;"- The insane levels of like climate control,"
09:44;09:47;"crates and stuff are really old pieces of work."
09:47;09:48;"- Right."
09:48;09:49;"- And like, there'll be like a dude,"
09:49;09:52;"like he has to travel with just one painting."
09:52;09:55;"Like if the painting is going from, let's say London"
09:55;09:56;"to Chicago for an exhibition"
09:56;09:58;"and it's like some old Van Gogh or something."
09:58;09:59;"- Yeah."
09:59;10:01;"- There's a dude that travels with that painting."
10:01;10:03;"- On a commercial flight?"
10:03;10:04;"- Yes."
10:04;10:04;"- But like has--"
10:04;10:05;"- Is he checking it or he's holding it?"
10:05;10:06;"- Well, it depends on the size."
10:06;10:08;"Okay, it gets into a whole other thing."
10:08;10:10;"If it's small, they'll have it with them."
10:10;10:11;"- In their lap."
10:11;10:12;"- Yes."
10:12;10:14;"- Just like sitting next to some rando."
10:14;10:15;"Hey man, how you doing?"
10:15;10:17;"What line of work are you in?"
10:17;10:20;"- I'm transporting a $300 million Van Gogh."
10:20;10:22;"- Van Gogh, can I take a peek?"
10:22;10:24;"Come on, crack it open."
10:24;10:26;"Come on, this guy's got a Van Gogh right here."
10:26;10:28;"- Let me buy you a drink, buddy."
10:28;10:30;"- I don't think I've ever heard a story though,"
10:30;10:32;"you know, thankfully, about a crash"
10:32;10:33;"or something bad happening."
10:33;10:35;"There's someone just like a cargo plane"
10:35;10:40;"carrying like $2 billion worth of Rembrandts."
10:40;10:40;"- Went down."
10:40;10:44;"- Went down as it flew to Dubai for the art fair."
10:44;10:45;"- The art fair?"
10:45;10:48;"There's a cool Rembrandts at an art fair."
10:48;10:49;"- Well, no, they--"
10:49;10:52;"- No, yeah, you can picture some like crazy private museum"
10:52;10:54;"or something in Dubai and some dude"
10:54;10:56;"putting on like a Rembrandt show."
10:56;10:59;"- I mean, I remember being at like Art Basel in Miami"
10:59;11:00;"and seeing like some,"
11:00;11:02;"obviously it's not the majority of the fair,"
11:02;11:04;"but there'd be like some really blue chip things"
11:04;11:06;"you'd walk over and there'd be like a Picasso."
11:06;11:08;"- Okay, Rembrandt would be pushing it."
11:08;11:09;"- Yeah."
11:09;11:11;"- At the Art Basel Miami."
11:11;11:12;"- Right."
11:12;11:13;"- Maybe like a Picasso etching or something,"
11:13;11:15;"maybe one painting."
11:15;11:16;"That even seems like it's pushing it."
11:16;11:18;"- Yeah, you're probably right."
11:18;11:20;"I can picture a Rembrandt at,"
11:20;11:23;"well, 'cause you hear about these major art fairs"
11:23;11:24;"in other parts of the world."
11:24;11:25;"- Yeah."
11:25;11:26;"- There's more of like a nascent"
11:26;11:29;"global capital art world vibe."
11:29;11:30;"- Sure, sure."
11:30;11:32;"- And I bet they're chucking in a few Rembrandts."
11:32;11:32;"- No."
11:32;11:35;"- How many Rembrandts do you think there are--"
11:35;11:35;"- In existence?"
11:35;11:36;"- In the Gulf?"
11:36;11:37;"No."
11:37;11:38;"- Oh, in the Middle East?"
11:38;11:39;"- Yeah."
11:39;11:41;"- One or two in private collections."
11:41;11:42;"- Or museums."
11:42;11:44;"- I don't know."
11:44;11:44;"I've never been."
11:44;11:46;"- How many Rembrandts do you think there are in China?"
11:46;11:47;"'Cause you--"
11:47;11:48;"- God, this is a good question"
11:48;11:52;"because the major institutions in Europe and the US,"
11:52;11:54;"you know, bought all the Rembrandts,"
11:54;11:55;"let's say--"
11:55;11:56;"- It's only fair."
11:56;11:57;"- 19th century or--"
11:57;11:58;"- Also think about all the precious art"
11:58;12:00;"that the West has--"
12:00;12:01;"- Plundered."
12:01;12:03;"- Plundered from other parts of the world."
12:03;12:06;"It's about time to get some Rembrandts over there."
12:06;12:08;"- I don't think there's a lot of Rembrandts just like--"
12:08;12:10;"- In private collections."
12:10;12:12;"Or I guess museums do trade,"
12:12;12:12;"so you could be like,"
12:12;12:13;"oh yeah, there's one that's at a museum"
12:13;12:14;"for two years right now."
12:14;12:16;"- Oh yeah, yeah, trade."
12:16;12:18;"Museums will lend pieces."
12:18;12:19;"- Yeah."
12:19;12:20;"- Not really trade."
12:20;12:22;"- Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch on that?"
12:22;12:25;"How many Rembrandts are there in the Middle East?"
12:25;12:29;"- I was gonna say that I would bet 98% of the Rembrandts"
12:29;12:32;"are in New York, London, the Netherlands."
12:32;12:34;"- Right, 'cause there's like a Rembrandt museum"
12:34;12:35;"in the Netherlands?"
12:35;12:36;"- Probably."
12:36;12:38;"There's like a whole Rembrandt room at the Met."
12:38;12:40;"- We just got some intel."
12:40;12:43;"Time Crisis is the home of live Google research."
12:43;12:44;"That should be a new segment,"
12:44;12:45;"such a part of this show."
12:45;12:46;"- Oh yeah."
12:46;12:47;"- Live Google research."
12:47;12:51;"- We end up on a really random conversational tangent."
12:51;12:52;"- Yeah."
12:52;12:53;"- And then we end up Googling."
12:53;12:53;"- Right."
12:53;12:55;"- It's just like hanging out."
12:55;12:55;"- Yeah, exactly."
12:55;12:56;"- This is just a hangout show."
12:56;12:58;"- We bring the real life experience to people."
12:58;13:01;"Some shows prepare, have pages of research."
13:01;13:05;"Time Crisis, we come up with an improvisational idea live,"
13:05;13:07;"kinda like John Coltrane or The Grateful Dead."
13:07;13:10;"We riff on it, and we're gonna Google it live with you."
13:10;13:13;"- Okay, this guy Thomas Kaplan owns some Rembrandts."
13:13;13:16;"We've been lending to about 40 museums around the world,"
13:16;13:19;"Thomas Kaplan tells Post Magazine."
13:19;13:22;"We used to do that anonymously, and we liked it that way."
13:22;13:23;"Owning doesn't confer respectability."
13:23;13:26;"We had no desire for the social cachet"
13:26;13:29;"that would come with being seen as big collectors."
13:29;13:31;"But the couple have decided a low-key approach"
13:31;13:33;"no longer strikes the right note."
13:33;13:35;"In Shanghai, the city where collectors often live"
13:35;13:38;"by the motto, ""If you got it, flaunt it,"""
13:38;13:40;"Kaplan explains that he is taking his paintings"
13:40;13:41;"around the world to spread the word"
13:41;13:44;"about his other passions, saving big cats"
13:44;13:47;"and using art to promote a sense of cultural openness"
13:47;13:48;"and shared humanity."
13:48;13:51;"In September, he is in Shanghai to launch"
13:51;13:54;"the Leiden Collection Exhibition at the Long Museum,"
13:54;13:56;"where visitors are the first to see 78"
13:56;13:59;"of the collection's highlights under one roof."
13:59;14:01;"A smaller selection was unveiled at the Louvre in Paris"
14:01;14:03;"and Beijing's National Museum of China."
14:03;14:06;"The exhibition will travel to the Louvre Abu Dhabi"
14:06;14:08;"when it leaves Shanghai in February."
14:08;14:11;"- Right, Louvre Abu Dhabi, that must have all sorts of..."
14:11;14:12;"Okay, so--"
14:12;14:14;"- So there's Rembrandts on cargo planes"
14:14;14:15;"going around the world."
14:15;14:17;"- Rembrandts are making the rounds."
14:17;14:19;"- Got the insurance on that kind of stuff."
14:19;14:22;"- What's the most expensive art you've ever handled?"
14:22;14:24;"- Uh, that's an interesting question."
14:24;14:28;"- You ever touched, like, a 17th, 18th century type painting?"
14:28;14:30;"- I wanna say so, but maybe not."
14:30;14:33;"I worked at the Hammer and I worked at SF MoMA."
14:33;14:34;"- So those are more modern stuff?"
14:34;14:35;"- Yeah, more modern."
14:35;14:37;"- Would you ever handle, like, a Warhol?"
14:37;14:38;"- Oh yeah, for sure."
14:38;14:41;"I probably, I wanna say a Picasso."
14:41;14:42;"- You handled a Picasso?"
14:42;14:44;"- I think so, it's really not, when you're doing that work,"
14:44;14:47;"it's not, you're not like, ""Oh my God, it's a Picasso."""
14:47;14:48;"- Really?"
14:48;14:49;"- It's a sense that you wanna be careful,"
14:49;14:51;"but you're being careful with everything in a museum."
14:51;14:52;"- Right."
14:52;14:55;"- Remember when Steve Wynn put his elbow through a Picasso?"
14:55;14:56;"- His finger, yeah."
14:56;14:56;"- Oh yeah."
14:56;14:58;"- As an artist yourself and an art appreciator,"
14:58;15:00;"does that, like, break your heart?"
15:00;15:01;"- No, I think it's hilarious."
15:01;15:02;"(laughing)"
15:02;15:04;"He owned it and he put his finger, he's like, ""Look!"""
15:04;15:05;"And he like--"
15:05;15:06;"- A few times though, right?"
15:06;15:07;"- I think it was just once,"
15:07;15:08;"and he put his finger right through it,"
15:08;15:11;"which is crazy because canvas is, like, taught."
15:11;15:13;"I don't know how, like--"
15:13;15:15;"- He must've really been gesticulating."
15:15;15:18;"- Or it's just like, gives you a sense of how, like,"
15:18;15:21;"brittle and rotten the support was that it was on,"
15:21;15:22;"you know, like paintings."
15:22;15:25;"I bet Picasso was using, like, cheap burlap or something"
15:25;15:26;"that's already, like, 100 years old"
15:26;15:28;"that's been eaten away by oil paint."
15:28;15:29;"- When you talk to other art handlers,"
15:29;15:32;"will people be like, ""Oh yeah, I handled that."""
15:32;15:33;"- No."
15:33;15:34;"- You wouldn't be just sitting around,"
15:34;15:35;"somebody would reference a specific painting,"
15:35;15:37;"and somebody would be like, ""Oh yeah, I handled that in '97."""

21:14;21:16;"Can you name like a true classic band"

21:27;21:29;"- I don't know if it is a chicken or the egg thing."
21:29;21:33;"- So for instance, every US president,"
21:33;21:34;"at least in our lifetime,"
21:34;21:37;"has had this a very distinctive voice."
21:37;21:38;"Like it's so easy."
21:38;21:40;"You don't have to be Frank Caliendo"
21:40;21:45;"to do a serviceable Trump, Obama, W, Clinton impression."

21:47;21:49;"- Jimmy Carter didn't really."
21:49;21:50;"- I guess I wasn't alive."
21:50;21:52;"- When Obama first came on the scene,"
21:52;21:54;"I remember thinking his voice was not very distinctive"
21:54;21:57;"and it wasn't until Fred Armisen did an impression of him."
21:57;21:57;"- That's my point."
21:57;21:59;"- I was like, oh wow, he does."
21:59;22:01;"- Because we've heard these voices so much,"
22:01;22:02;"anybody on the street"
22:02;22:04;"could probably do a decent Obama impression."
22:04;22:06;"Now some folks are saying that,"
22:06;22:09;"(mumbles)"
22:09;22:10;"- Let me be clear."

22:12;22:13;"Yeah, I don't know."
22:13;22:14;"(laughs)"
22:14;22:16;"It's like, Obama just has such a very distinct,"
22:16;22:18;"but so my question is,"
22:18;22:19;"if you had just been like,"
22:19;22:21;"hey, there's this guy from Chicago,"
22:21;22:22;"listen to his voice,"
22:22;22:23;"would we have been like,"
22:23;22:25;"he's got a very unique cadence,"
22:25;22:27;"a very distinctive way of speaking,"
22:27;22:28;"or is it that it's drilled in our head,"
22:28;22:31;"so now Obama has an iconic speaking style?"
22:31;22:33;"- Well like, yeah, what if like,"
22:33;22:36;"Jeb Bush had won the presidency?"
22:36;22:39;"- Right, would we all be kind of like, no Jebisms?"
22:39;22:41;"And I mean, Jeb, we watched a bunch of Jeb"
22:41;22:44;"that was like Vic Berger videos were hilarious"
22:44;22:46;"of him talking, but yeah, he didn't have, or--"
22:46;22:48;"- It's the theory of Jeb Bush had a distinct voice,"
22:48;22:49;"maybe he'd be president."
22:49;22:50;"- See, that's what I can't figure out."
22:50;22:52;"- Obviously, like Trump,"
22:52;22:54;"well Trump's been famous for 30 plus years"
22:54;22:57;"that he already has this distinctive way of talking,"
22:57;22:59;"but or do you need a distinctive cadence"
22:59;23:03;"to be president slash singer in a successful band?"
23:03;23:05;"- If I was running for president,"
23:05;23:07;"what do you think the like, Jake-isms"
23:07;23:09;"or the people that do impressions of me,"
23:09;23:12;"like what would be the thing to latch onto?"
23:12;23:14;"- That's funny, it's like, I've known you for a long time"
23:14;23:16;"and you do have a very distinctive voice"
23:16;23:18;"and way of speaking, but yeah,"
23:18;23:21;"maybe because I've never seen it parodied or something,"
23:21;23:22;"I wouldn't know exactly."
23:22;23:24;"- Candidate Jake Longstreth."
23:24;23:25;"- I mean, you say-- - Oh, bro."
23:25;23:28;"- You say man a lot, you know what I noticed?"

23:29;23:31;"we walked in, there's coffee and donuts"
23:31;23:34;"and this is something that you say a lot,"

23:42;23:43;"- Right, the housing crisis"
23:43;23:46;"in Southern California is brutal."
23:46;23:46;"- Yeah."
23:46;23:48;"- The homeless situation's f'ed."
23:48;23:50;"- Bands, yeah, I mean, you have that,"
23:50;23:52;"duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,"
23:52;23:54;"you have that kind of cadence."
23:54;23:56;"Band where the person doesn't have"
23:56;23:58;"a quote-unquote distinctive voice."
23:58;24:00;"- There's bands that are sort of like,"
24:00;24:03;"not super iconic bands, like Squeeze or something,"
24:03;24:05;"where it's like, kind of distinctive."
24:05;24:07;"- I think those guys have distinctive voices,"
24:07;24:09;"but maybe it's true in everything,"
24:09;24:12;"even if you look at like the biggest pop stars of all time."
24:12;24:13;"- Sure."
24:13;24:15;"- Michael Jackson, insanely unique."
24:15;24:17;"- Oh yeah."
24:17;24:18;"- I mean, who's big now?"
24:18;24:19;"- Drake."
24:19;24:22;"- Drake's got a very specific tone and texture."
24:22;24:23;"- You know who doesn't?"
24:23;24:24;"- Who?"
24:24;24:25;"- Ed Sheeran."
24:25;24:26;"- Even Ed Sheeran, as time goes on,"
24:26;24:30;"and he becomes such like a permanent part of culture,"
24:30;24:33;"I feel like you know his voice."
24:33;24:36;"- I'm saying the actual like, timbre of his voice."
24:36;24:37;"- Timbre."
24:37;24:39;"- It's pronounced timbre."
24:39;24:40;"- No, it's timbre."
24:40;24:41;"- No, I'm just messing around."
24:41;24:42;"- But you know what's funny, there was just a Seinfeld,"
24:42;24:43;"I was just watching a Seinfeld episode"
24:43;24:45;"where like George is like, the timbre of her voice,"
24:45;24:47;"and Jerry's like, I think it's timbre."

26:09;26:12;"- He did a 17 minute audio interview"
26:12;26:13;"about that very subject."
26:13;26:16;"I guess, well they're both Midwestern."
26:16;26:18;"Tim Allen owns a home along Lake Michigan"
26:18;26:21;"near Tobin Sprout's family home."
26:21;26:22;"And he came across some of his paintings"
26:22;26:25;"at a gallery in Leland, Michigan."
26:25;26:27;"His perspective is pretty particular, Allen notes."
26:27;26:29;"It's kind of like a semi-wide angle lens."
26:29;26:30;"There's a whimsical kind of cartoony,"
26:30;26:32;"there's too much of something."
26:32;26:34;"I can't be specific about it, it affected me."
26:34;26:35;"I like his composition, 'cause again,"
26:35;26:38;"it's not dead on, it's a little asymmetrical I guess."
26:38;26:39;"- I watched the video,"
26:39;26:42;"and there was one passing reference to GBV."
26:42;26:43;"Not by name, Tim was just like,"
26:43;26:45;"Tobin's an interesting guy, he's this great painter,"
26:45;26:48;"he's got this rock and roll band."
26:48;26:51;"And then the interviewer clearly had no interest in the band"
26:51;26:52;"and they were just going deep"
26:52;26:54;"on Tobin's photorealistic paintings,"
26:54;26:56;"which I've been a fan of too for a long time."
26:56;26:57;"- Really? - Oh yeah."
26:57;27:00;"- So Tobin Sprout is just a member of Guided by Voices?"
27:00;27:03;"- Yeah, he was like, he always contributed"
27:03;27:07;"one or two or three songs to those real classic records."
27:07;27:09;"- There was this, I think it's a Tobin Sprout song"
27:09;27:10;"that I always liked."
27:10;27:11;"Oh yeah, do you know this one?"
27:11;27:13;"This is a Tobin Sprout song."
27:13;27:19;"It's called Small Parade."
27:19;27:21;"- I weirdly don't, is this on a solo record?"
27:21;27:23;"- It was on a Matador compilation,"
27:23;27:25;"called What's Up Matador."
27:25;27:26;"- Okay."

28:22;28:23;"- Beautiful."
28:23;28:24;"- What's Tim Allen's story anyway?"
28:24;28:26;"He's like super right wing?"
28:26;28:27;"- Yeah, 'cause that show-- - Is he a trope guy?"
28:27;28:30;"- He is, 'cause that show Last Man Standing,"
28:30;28:32;"I think it was all about like the,"
28:32;28:34;"I don't know how to say it diplomatically,"
28:34;28:38;"but the erosion of Tim Allen culture in America."
28:38;28:40;"There you go. - Oh, I don't know the show."
28:40;28:40;"What's the show?"
28:40;28:42;"Is it on? - It's about him"
28:42;28:46;"'cause he's like an aging right wing white guy"
28:46;28:49;"and probably like his daughter's woke or something."
28:49;28:50;"- Is it a sitcom?"
28:50;28:52;"- He's a senior employee of a sporting goods store"
28:52;28:54;"in Denver, Colorado."
28:54;28:55;"- Denver."
28:55;28:57;"- Married father of three daughters."
28:57;28:58;"- It's a real lefty town."
28:58;29:00;"- And the series includes interactions"
29:00;29:03;"expressing his conservative political views."
29:03;29:05;"And I think it was canceled, right?"
29:05;29:06;"- Oh yeah, and he said that they took him off the air"
29:06;29:07;"'cause of his views."
29:07;29:09;"He's described himself as a center right"
29:09;29:12;"fiscal conservative, but he's socially liberal."
29:12;29:14;"He supported John Kasich for president 2016."
29:14;29:15;"- All right."
29:15;29:18;"- He has expressed some support for Donald Trump"
29:18;29:19;"and attended his inauguration."
29:19;29:21;"That's big support."
29:21;29:23;"- Go to the inauguration?"
29:23;29:24;"But why was the show canceled?"
29:24;29:26;"I mean, you can make shows about people"
29:26;29:27;"that aren't-- - On his show,"
29:27;29:29;"he called Obama a dictator"
29:29;29:30;"and wanted to call him a communist."
29:30;29:32;"- Oh, but the show was brought back."
29:32;29:34;"- I never understood the Obama as dictator thing"
29:34;29:35;"from the right."
29:35;29:36;"It's just always--"
29:36;29:38;"- Yeah, I mean-- - Nothing about him."
29:38;29:39;"- What the, that's just what I was like,"
29:39;29:41;"what the are you talking about?"
29:41;29:42;"- Right."
29:42;29:44;"Like, do you mean Obama wants to like never leave office?"
29:44;29:47;"Is that what you mean by dictator?"
29:47;29:47;"- Yeah, Obama just--"
29:47;29:50;"- I think they meant like, oh, he wants to,"
29:50;29:51;"he's trying to put healthcare for everyone"
29:51;29:55;"and like dictate large sort of social policies"
29:55;29:56;"that everyone has to adhere to."
29:56;29:57;"But not even."
29:57;29:58;"- Yeah, that's crazy."
29:58;29:59;"- But why was Tim, whatever,"
29:59;30:00;"we're talking about Tim Allen's show."
30:00;30:01;"I don't know."
30:01;30:03;"I mean, my larger point is you should be able"
30:03;30:07;"to make shows about people that are Trump supporters."
30:07;30:09;"You can make a show about that."
30:09;30:11;"That should be a valid thing to make a show about"
30:11;30:15;"considering what, a third or 40% of the country is on board."
30:15;30:17;"- Well, look what happened to Roseanne though."
30:17;30:18;"- I mean, that could have been a cool show"
30:18;30:20;"if she didn't wild out on Twitter."
30:20;30:21;"I mean, I didn't see the show, but like--"
30:21;30:23;"- This is the time crisis take on Roseanne."
30:23;30:24;"- This is the media corner."
30:24;30:25;"- But that's coming back too."
30:25;30:27;"- Classic, two months too late."
30:27;30:29;"- Wait, what do you mean it's coming back without her?"
30:29;30:30;"- It's called the Conners."
30:30;30:31;"It's coming out, it's just about the family."
30:31;30:33;"- Is John Goodman on it?"
30:33;30:34;"- I think so."
30:34;30:36;"Yeah, I think it's everybody but Roseanne."
30:36;30:38;"- So that'll be popular for like two weeks"
30:38;30:39;"and then just take a nose dive."
30:39;30:43;"- Is there some artistic reason to like dig into that?"
30:43;30:45;"I mean, 'cause like, look, if you had somebody"
30:45;30:48;"in your family who was like a big Trump supporter"
30:48;30:49;"and you're not--"
30:49;30:50;"- I did."
30:50;30:51;"- Oh, really?"
30:51;30:53;"- Yeah, my aunt was a huge supporter and then she died."
30:53;30:54;"- My brother Dave."
30:54;30:56;"- She went into a coma the day after the election"
30:56;30:58;"and then died shortly thereafter."
30:58;30:59;"- Damn, I didn't know that."
30:59;31:01;"- Yeah, man, but she was really stressed"
31:01;31:04;"that the election would be stolen from Trump"
31:04;31:08;"and she was so intense and like already in terrible health"
31:08;31:11;"to begin with and we don't know what happened"
31:11;31:14;"but like the day after the election that he won,"
31:14;31:16;"she like went into a coma and then died a few weeks later."
31:16;31:19;"But she and my uncle got in this huge fight on Facebook."
31:19;31:20;"- These are siblings."
31:20;31:21;"- Yes, yes."
31:21;31:22;"- Not husband and wife."
31:22;31:26;"- No, my mom's older sister, now deceased,"
31:26;31:27;"and my mom's younger brother, Ted,"
31:27;31:29;"who lives in Pasadena, comes to all our shows."
31:29;31:32;"- Oh yeah, and he's a crunchy dude, loves rock and roll."
31:32;31:35;"- They got into a crazy fight about Trump on Facebook,"
31:35;31:36;"which is just classic."
31:36;31:37;"- Right."
31:37;31:38;"- Ended on a poor note."
31:38;31:40;"It's an emo story."
31:40;31:43;"Like their last contact was fighting about Trump."
31:43;31:46;"Then Trump wins, Janie goes into a coma, that's it."
31:46;31:47;"- That's heavy."
31:47;31:48;"- Very."
31:48;31:49;"- That is the shit that people always talk,"
31:49;31:50;"I've never like fully related to,"
31:50;31:53;"maybe 'cause my family's like kinda small."
31:53;31:56;"Or like my, like I did have cousins and uncles"
31:56;31:59;"in places like California and Texas,"
31:59;32:01;"but my family, as noted on the program,"
32:01;32:03;"is not big into travel."
32:03;32:05;"So we're like pretty posted up."
32:05;32:07;"We were pretty posted up in the tri-state."
32:07;32:11;"And you know, within my main family generationally,"
32:11;32:13;"like grandparents and parents and stuff,"
32:13;32:16;"everybody's like, you know, pretty classically old school,"
32:16;32:18;"New York Jewish liberals."
32:18;32:19;"- Right."
32:19;32:22;"- You know, great uncle was in the Communist Party"
32:22;32:25;"when he was a student at CUNY."
32:25;32:26;"That's just like such a common story"
32:26;32:28;"for people from that era."
32:28;32:31;"And the concept of my aunt and uncle"
32:31;32:36;"got into a crazy debate on Facebook about Trump."
32:36;32:37;"That's the shit that I always hear about,"
32:37;32:38;"but I'm always kinda like."
32:38;32:41;"- Yeah, my mom's family was always really split."
32:41;32:44;"My mom and her younger brother Ted were always Dems,"
32:44;32:46;"or Ted like super kind of like lefty,"
32:46;32:48;"Ralph Nader kinda dude."
32:48;32:52;"And then my mom's older siblings were like hard Republicans."
32:52;32:55;"- I wonder if that happens more or less now."
32:55;32:58;"Like, I wonder if there's just something different"
32:58;33:00;"about these times that like a group of kids from a family"
33:00;33:03;"tend not to diverge quite as much."
33:03;33:05;"- I bet that's maybe the case."
33:05;33:09;"- I could picture there's like a family, two brothers,"
33:09;33:11;"both played soccer at the local high school"
33:11;33:13;"and just one's like, I'm a Trump guy."
33:13;33:15;"He likes Elizabeth Warren, you know?"
33:15;33:17;"- It must happen and it could, I mean,"
33:17;33:18;"people are complicated."
33:18;33:21;"It could be like so much of a product of the psychology"
33:21;33:24;"of your role in the family or like,"
33:24;33:28;"people just like get into ideologies and worldviews"
33:28;33:32;"for mysterious reasons, whether it's innate"
33:32;33:32;"or whether it's like, yeah,"
33:32;33:36;"you felt always like ostracized from your family"
33:36;33:38;"and your family's like, for whatever reason."
33:38;33:38;"- Or just to be a contrarian."
33:38;33:40;"- Yeah, just be a contrarian, you know."
33:40;33:42;"- It's like that guy Stephen Miller who works for Trump."
33:42;33:45;"You know, I know people went to high school with him."
33:45;33:47;"- Right, he's from Santa Monica, right?"
33:47;33:47;"What do they say about him?"
33:47;33:48;"- He's from Santa Monica."
33:48;33:50;"Well, you can read about this."
33:50;33:51;"A lot of people have talked about it."
33:51;33:54;"He, even in high school, 'cause even when I went to college,"
33:54;33:56;"I'd meet people who went to Santa Monica High School,"
33:56;33:58;"also known as Sam-O-High."
33:58;34:00;"And yeah, the people you would meet were just like,"
34:00;34:04;"what you'd expect, California lefties, intellectual types."
34:04;34:06;"So I think he always prided himself"
34:06;34:09;"on being like, fuck this."
34:09;34:10;"He was angry about it."
34:10;34:11;"And then you'd read these interviews with his parents"
34:11;34:12;"where they're kind of like,"
34:12;34:14;"it's not like he was raised by, you know."
34:14;34:15;"- Hippies."
34:15;34:16;"- Hippies, but they were kind of like,"
34:16;34:20;"yeah, we're pretty classic, like democratic family."
34:20;34:22;"I feel like the armchair psychology on that one"
34:22;34:23;"checks out pretty well."
34:23;34:25;"But again, now I'm interested in this."
34:25;34:28;"If anybody, any TC heads come from a family,"
34:28;34:30;"and I'm not talking about aunt and uncle,"
34:30;34:33;"but like siblings, same generation,"
34:33;34:35;"not a major age difference,"
34:35;34:39;"just having like hardcore, differing political views."
34:39;34:39;"- Now."
34:39;34:43;"- Now, I bet some other podcast or radio show did this"
34:43;34:44;"two and a half years ago."
34:44;34:45;"- This American life."
34:45;34:47;"- Also, I feel like obviously"
34:47;34:49;"it's more of a deal breaker now."
34:49;34:49;"- Oh yeah."
34:49;34:51;"- Like in the 80s, you can imagine somebody being like,"
34:51;34:55;"even though again, there were really harsh elements of it,"
34:55;34:56;"then I'm not trying to say that"
34:56;34:58;"the differences are worse now,"
34:58;34:59;"but yeah, you just imagine somebody being like,"
34:59;35:01;"you're voting for Reagan."
35:01;35:02;"Come on, man."
35:02;35:03;"Hey, I like what the guy's got to say."
35:03;35:04;"Okay."

36:29;36:32;"around you my love"
36:32;36:35;"I mean my parents siblings were all like on both sides my mom and my dad"
36:35;36:39;"all was Republican and I always thought it was maybe because of the 60s"
36:39;36:43;"yeah because like my parents older siblings were too old to like"
36:43;36:46;"be hip to like the changes of the 60s"
36:46;36:50;"in the most like time life sort of way like they didn't listen to Bob Dylan"
36:50;36:54;"didn't smoke weed didn't listen to Dylan didn't protest the Vietnam War"
36:54;36:57;"right and my my parents were of that perfect generation"
36:57;37:01;"and then my mom's younger brother was like a punk in the 70s"
37:01;37:05;"so of course he's in that post 1960s like worldview"
37:05;37:09;"and then the older siblings were like very 1950s"
37:09;37:13;"right but then my dad's side by the time Obama came around"
37:13;37:17;"his older siblings were like yeah we're not like they voted for Reagan and Bush and W"
37:17;37:21;"yeah and then they were like yeah we're out I could almost picture that where"
37:21;37:26;"someone's like well listen I was 14 in 2008 when Obama was elected"
37:26;37:31;"and there was like a real sense of excitement we were listening to Lil Wayne"
37:31;37:36;"and MGMT didn't have a care in the world but then my younger brother he was 14"
37:36;37:42;"in 2016 way harsher on social media he ended up getting into some weird"
37:42;37:47;"yeah subreddits Lil Wayne wasn't releasing as much music"
37:47;37:51;"and yeah he really came up in a very different world and I think it kind of warped his brain"
37:51;37:56;"I could honestly believe that it sounds ridiculous but yeah"
37:56;38:00;"yeah it's like I'm we're just a little too old to like because I was in my 20s"
38:00;38:04;"through all that to like fully appreciate the I can't wait for that"
38:04;38:08;"but it's like you already find that people make fun of memes that are like about 90s kids"
38:08;38:11;"because 90s kids are becoming kind of passe"
38:11;38:14;"because there always used to be these memes that are just like only 90s kids remember"
38:14;38:17;"and it was like this exciting thing to reminisce about the 90s"
38:17;38:21;"and what was it like to be a child in the 90s and now it's hitting that place where it's like"
38:21;38:25;"you're a 90s kid you're 28 years old get your together"
38:25;38:29;"right where as soon it's gonna be some like crazy where in two years people who are"
38:29;38:37;"20 okay so 20 and 20 18 let's say 20 and 2020 okay so you're born in 2000"
38:37;38:46;"then you're born in 2000 that means that you are 14 in 2014 six years after Obama was elected"
38:46;38:52;"six years after the first Vampire Weekend album came out so you're 14 in 2014 like it seems so random"
38:52;38:59;"so like what were you taking in in that moment culturally politically you're gonna have the 90s"
38:59;39:06;"90s kids are gonna be like baby boomers to you right all right let's say that on February 20th 2020"
39:06;39:12;"we'll do it a 20 year olds TC town hall kind of get the pulse of the streets love that"
39:13;39:14;"i say he's so sweet"
39:14;39:16;"i think i wanna let the rap power"
39:16;39:20;"so i live in the rap zone"

44:07;44:12;"""What I think has been missing from the conversations is the input of the creatives behind the advertising."""
44:12;44:13;"This is true."
44:13;44:14;"Yeah."

44:19;44:23;"particularly during last week's discussion about IHOP and it's orchestrators Droga5."
44:23;44:28;"""I am a fairly young/new creative to the industry, copywriter to be specific,"
44:28;44:33;"and I think I can offer a less harsh take on the intentions of ad campaigns such as this."
44:33;44:39;"Droga5 certainly has its problems as an agency, but in general, their creatives are young cynics, such as yourselves."
44:39;44:41;"Jake, you're young at heart."""
44:41;44:42;"I'll take it."
44:42;44:45;"""Most aren't Vassar grads, unfortunately."""
44:45;44:49;"Well we picked Vassar at random. It could be any liberal arts college."
44:49;44:50;"Yeah."
44:50;44:51;"Just want to clarify that."
44:51;44:55;"""In this crazy digital world, advertising's metrics for success have shifted."
44:55;45:01;"Despite the fact that Jake is measuring success by moving product, that isn't always the primary objective."""
45:01;45:05;"One of your big things was like, ""Is this getting people in the door, or is this just some pointless bulls**t?"""
45:05;45:07;"""Are they selling burgers?"""
45:07;45:08;"Yeah."
45:08;45:11;"""Sometimes it's about taking a small budget and getting free media impressions,"
45:11;45:16;"something ad agencies tout to clients to show how they can make the most of a menial client brief."
45:16;45:18;"Another is not for the client, but the agency."
45:18;45:22;"In days past, agencies would spend their own money to run an ad once in the paper"
45:22;45:24;"just so it would qualify to win awards."
45:24;45:26;"The same mindset exists today."
45:26;45:29;"Sell a weird idea through just to show that you did it."
45:29;45:33;"This can result in PR for the agency more so than the brand they did the work for."""
45:33;45:34;"Okay, that's interesting."
45:34;45:35;"That's whack."
45:35;45:38;"You don't respect that as an artist though, Jake?"
45:38;45:39;"No, because they're not artists."
45:39;45:41;"Oh!"
45:41;45:44;"Their job is to advertise for their clients."
45:44;45:48;"I could care less about advertising awards, so that's me."
45:48;45:51;"What if you ended up in that world?"
45:51;45:53;"Yeah, then I'd have a different perspective."
45:53;45:56;"If I worked in advertising, then I would give a sh-- about it."
45:56;45:58;"Okay, but I'm saying don't you have sympathy for these people?"
45:58;46:00;"It's not about sympathy."
46:00;46:03;"I guess advertising is a funny one because it's--"
46:03;46:04;"I also saw a tweet like this."
46:04;46:08;"It was somebody who worked in social media for a brand, and they were like,"
46:08;46:13;"""You know, a lot of people don't realize that us younger people who do the social media for these brands,"
46:13;46:16;"we don't have a whole lot of corporate power, and we're just doing our best."
46:16;46:19;"It's not really cool that you keep telling us to kill ourselves."""
46:19;46:20;"And so you could look at that--"
46:20;46:22;"Wait, who's telling them to kill themselves?"
46:22;46:25;"I guess, like, say you're the person who's doing the branding for Pop-Tarts."
46:25;46:26;"Right."
46:26;46:30;"Who recently--we got a lot of e-mails about this--recently did this, like, insane thing where they--"
46:30;46:35;"it was like an alcoholic drink with a Pop-Tart stuck in it as, like, a garnish."
46:35;46:37;"Just kind of a gross, funny image."
46:37;46:41;"And they said, ""Don't worry. It's a virgin just like you,"" or something."
46:41;46:43;"Yeah. Isn't Pop-Tarts for kids?"
46:43;46:44;"[laughter]"
46:44;46:45;"Like, 7-year-olds?"
46:45;46:46;"Like you?"
46:46;46:49;"Yeah. Also, like, who's their target?"
46:49;46:52;"But there is this thing--I mean, I've certainly experienced it on the Internet--"
46:52;46:57;"where, like, there's a type of love-hate relationship that people have as fans"
46:57;47:02;"or even as people with fans where there's this kind of, like, half-real, half-fake,"
47:02;47:04;"like, just being mean to each other thing."
47:04;47:09;"So maybe Pop-Tarts is trying to be the bad boy here, basically being like,"
47:09;47:12;"""You know what? There's a whole segment of kids out there."
47:12;47:14;"Their moms and dads are super nice to them,"
47:14;47:19;"and they give them some healthy steel-cut oatmeal for breakfast"
47:19;47:23;"or some goji berry acai bowl sh*t,"
47:23;47:30;"and so the kid associates healthy food with kindness and warmth and family,"
47:30;47:33;"and their mom and dad are never going to let them do this."
47:33;47:38;"So how do we make our product stand in opposition to that good vibe,"
47:38;47:41;"familial, healthy, bougie sh*t?"
47:41;47:43;"Should Pop-Tarts be like, ""Hey, kid, we're nice too""?"
47:43;47:44;"No, that's never going to work."
47:44;47:46;"Should be like, ""Hey, kid, f*ck you."""
47:46;47:48;"Mom, what's a virgin?"
47:48;47:49;"Yeah."
49:18;49:21;"Back to this email."
49:21;49:22;"What are we talking about?"
49:22;49:27;"So this guy's saying that, ""Look, I'm trying to have sympathy for these people in a way."
49:27;49:30;"Say this is your job, and you're saddled with this."""
49:30;49:32;"I think about this a lot too."
49:32;49:35;"We're privileged that we get to be full-time artists,"
49:35;49:40;"and there's a lot of very creative people who maybe they can't paint, can't write songs."
49:40;49:41;"And in some ways--"
49:41;49:42;"I get it."
49:42;49:47;"Things like advertising are some of the most creative, non-artistic fields."
49:47;49:48;"Yeah."
49:48;49:51;"No, I remember thinking about that in college, being like, ""Maybe I should go into advertising."""
49:51;49:52;"Yeah, me too."
49:52;49:55;"I think every artist thinks about it in some ways,"
49:55;49:57;"because at the end of the day, there is something artistic about it."
49:57;50:01;"I remember trying to get an internship or maybe a low-level job--"
50:01;50:02;"At Wieden Kennedy?"
50:02;50:03;"Yeah."
50:03;50:05;"Yeah, Portland is a big advertising town."
50:05;50:07;"Senior year of college and just nothing."
50:07;50:11;"And I was like, ""I guess I'll deliver pizza and paint in my basement."""
50:11;50:13;"Maybe if I had gotten that gig at Wieden Kennedy--"
50:13;50:15;"Well, it's interesting. You wanted to be--"
50:15;50:17;"--that'd be a different track."
50:17;50:23;"You could have been painting the Papa John's brand with words and images as an advertiser,"
50:23;50:29;"but when you were excluded from the fast-paced world of advertising,"
50:29;50:32;"you split that job into two things--"
50:32;50:34;"--delivering Papa John's and painting--"
50:34;50:36;"Pictures of Taco Bell and Wendy's."
50:36;50:39;"--which is basically the component parts of what an advertiser is--"
50:39;50:42;"--a little bit of delivering pizzas and a little bit of making art."
50:42;50:44;"Making visual representations."
50:44;50:49;"So all I'm saying is, I think either you or I did have a job at Droga 5 or something,"
50:49;50:52;"and they were like, ""IHOP's coming through."""
50:52;50:56;"Part of our brains would be, of course, how can we help the client?"
50:56;51:02;"But another part of our brains would be, how can we just do something that is funny and wild,"
51:02;51:04;"shakes things up, stunts on our--"
51:04;51:06;"Also, classic, they want to stunt on their competitors."
51:06;51:08;"Competing ad agencies."
51:08;51:10;"Yeah, right. So imagine that you're at some--"
51:10;51:12;"If you're in the game, I get it."
51:12;51:15;"You go see your bro who works at Wieden Kennedy, you work at Droga 5."
51:15;51:17;"Like, ""Dude, check this out."""
51:17;51:20;"One guy's like, ""We had a very successful advertising campaign for Microsoft,"
51:20;51:26;"and actually some of the higher-ups at corporate are directly crediting our bus station ads,"
51:26;51:29;"boosting sales with a very specific demographic."""
51:29;51:35;"And you're kind of like, ""Well, I did IHOP, and we didn't sell a f***ing burger with that campaign,"
51:35;51:38;"but you know what? We popped a wheelie on the zeitgeist."""
51:38;51:42;"And that guy might be like, ""I'm Kanye, you're Macklemore."""
51:42;51:46;"I get it. I don't like it, but I get it."
51:46;51:53;"You did a really good job of articulating and dramatizing that conflict between those two colleagues"
51:53;51:55;"and opposing agencies."
51:55;51:57;"And shout-out to Macklemore. I like Macklemore."
51:57;52:01;"But I'm just saying, Macklemore is like a solid rapper, and he's a little bit of a pop guy,"
52:01;52:03;"but Kanye is the--"
52:03;52:05;"Popping the wheelie on the zeitgeist."
52:05;52:07;"I mean, he said it. He said it himself."
52:07;52:08;"Back to the email."
52:08;52:12;"Another thing to note is that CEOs of this brand like to brag to their CEO buddies"
52:12;52:17;"about their crazy creative agency they gave millions of dollars to come up with the next big thing."
52:17;52:21;"Droga5 has done great work, but they are also a bit of a hot commodity right now."
52:21;52:23;"Droga5 is the Kanye."
52:23;52:25;"I love this insider insight here."
52:25;52:31;"They're perceived as young, hot creatives, much sexier to work with than a BbDO or Gray."
52:31;52:35;"Droga5 is Kanye. BbDO is Jay-Z."
52:35;52:41;"Droga5 is Kurt Cobain in '93, and the other ones are the guy from The Rembrandts."
52:41;52:46;"Yeah, I've never seen an iconic sitcom with a Nirvana song opening."
52:46;52:49;"I've never seen David Schwimmer dancing in a fountain."
52:49;52:51;"To all apologies."
52:51;52:57;"I'm sorry I'm the guy from The Rembrandts, so I'm not f***ing Kurt Cobain."
52:57;52:59;"But I've accomplished s*** too."
52:59;53:04;"I would like to think that the creative team at Droga had a different school of thought guiding their actions, though."
53:04;53:06;"Disruption."
53:06;53:08;"Oh, that's my favorite word."
53:08;53:11;"That's not used enough in today's society."
53:11;53:12;"Yeah, I agree."
53:12;53:14;"Disruption, you never hear that word."
53:14;53:18;"I should do all the press for the Vampire Weekend album just talking about disruption."
53:18;53:22;"On this record, I'm taking the role just as a disruptor."
53:22;53:26;"I find that in most industries these days, people like to play it safe."
53:26;53:29;"But not me. I'm a disruptor."
53:29;53:36;"I like to be at the not quite cutting edge, but white-hot intersection of money and newness."
53:36;53:37;"Because I'm a disruptor."
53:37;53:41;"Yeah, when are people going to come around and be like, ""Being a disruptor is whack."""
53:41;53:43;"What's the opposite of a disruptor?"
53:43;53:45;"A very confident practitioner."
53:45;53:46;"I'm a CP."
53:46;53:48;"Confident practitioner!"
53:48;53:52;"Tim Allen's favorite Tobin Sprout song."
53:52;53:55;"In this day and age, it's difficult to get cut through the noise."
53:55;53:58;"Constant content flooding our screens, right?"
53:58;54:00;"The one way to get noticed is to do something radical."
54:00;54:02;"Something that disrupts the status quo."
54:02;54:08;"And there's a bit of novelty in the fact that a couple of people in a room got a huge brand that sells pancakes to change their name."
54:08;54:09;"I can totally relate to that."
54:09;54:13;"Like, if we came up with IHOP, we'd be like, ""I can't believe they f***ing did this as a whole."""
54:13;54:14;"Yeah, it's funny."
54:14;54:16;"It is a brand, a restaurant, that's all."
54:16;54:18;"And I think the best creatives know this."
54:18;54:20;"They don't take it as seriously as the press release may make it seem."
54:20;54:23;"In the end, IHOP has a budget for advertising."
54:23;54:24;"They're going to spend it on something."
54:24;54:26;"Why not make it something different?"
54:26;54:29;"I'd rather that than a thousand banner ads touting a new deal on burgers."
54:29;54:32;"The best advertising creatives are anti-capitalist double agents."
54:32;54:33;"Okay, that's a stretch."
54:33;54:34;"Yeah."
54:34;54:37;"They're anti-capitalist double agents as much as you and I are."
54:37;54:38;"Right."
54:38;54:40;"We're corporate sellouts, dude."
54:40;54:41;"Yeah."
54:41;54:43;"You wouldn't see Fugazi doing a show on Apple."
54:43;54:46;"I do think generationally, and we're definitely part of the problem,"
54:46;54:51;"it's like what used to be called a f***ing sellout is now anti-capitalist double agent."
54:51;54:52;"[laughter]"
54:52;54:58;"Like, imagine if you went to some hardcore left-wing punk in the '80s, and you're like, ""You know what?"
54:58;55:05;"I do a lot of business with big corporations, but I always say how much I hate capitalism."""
55:05;55:13;"Think about how subversive it would be if we used your Black Flag song in this ad for AT&T in 1983."
55:13;55:15;"That's a whole other conversation."
55:15;55:19;"The best advertising creatives are anti-capitalist double agents tossing absurdity into the vat of promotional ads."
55:19;55:27;"The one thing I will say is I do relate to and admire people who at least are not sanctimonious about it one way or another"
55:27;55:32;"and who are just like, ""I was born into an absurd world. I've ended up in an absurd place."
55:32;55:39;"I try not to do harm. I'm not going to go do f***ing, like, you know, Hummer ads."""
55:39;55:43;"But when something kind of weird like the IHOP thing comes across my desk,"
55:43;55:46;"yeah, I'm going to have some fun because all this is meaningless."
55:46;55:48;"At least that I can get behind."
55:48;55:52;"I don't know if you can call that anti-capitalist, but you can call it at least absurdist"
55:52;55:55;"in a way that recognizes the absurdity of the way we live."
55:55;55:58;"When it's done well, it can make the world a weirder, more interesting place."
55:58;56:00;"I kind of agree with that."
56:00;56:02;"And sometimes it even moves product."
56:02;56:04;"TC's resident madman, Nico."
56:04;56:07;"All right, shout out to Nico. That was a very thoughtful email."
56:07;56:14;"P.S. In Droga5's defense, check their work for Clearasil, MailChimp, and most importantly, the New York Times."
56:14;56:16;"Oh, he buried the lead."
56:16;56:21;"Yup, if you were wondering why that article was so glowing, preaching the success of an otherwise maligned campaign,"
56:21;56:24;"it may be because Droga5 does the New York Times advertising."
56:24;56:25;"Wow."
56:25;56:30;"Because if people don't remember, the whole reason we were talking about IHOP was because--"
56:30;56:34;"not because we actually cared that much about the campaign itself, but because there was this--"
56:34;56:40;"not an editorial, it was like just a write-up about the campaign in the New York Times that was kind of like,"
56:40;56:43;"""IHOP knocked it out of the park with this one. It's already a success."""
56:43;56:45;"And we're like, ""By what metrics?"""
56:45;56:50;"At least just say--put your name on it and say, ""We found this one very funny. We found it amusing."""
56:50;56:54;"But it was just weird. It was like this--accepting it as a--"
56:54;56:56;"Unqualified success."
56:56;56:57;"A fait accompli."
56:57;57:02;"In a case like that, don't they usually say, ""Full disclosure, Droga5 handles the New York Times."""
57:02;57:05;"Yeah, what the f-- Yeah, New York Times, that would require a full disclosure."
57:05;57:06;"Slippin'."
57:06;57:11;"When we're talking about how dope Droga5 is--and again, I'm not saying Droga5 is not cool."
57:11;57:14;"It sounds like they're cool in the advertising community."
57:14;57:18;"But I think the New York Times should have clarified that Droga5 has handled some of our work."
57:47;57:51;"So, Jake, now we're going to get on the phone with Sweet Martha."
57:51;57:54;"There's some big shake-ups in the Sweet Martha community."
57:54;57:59;"For people who don't remember, Sweet Martha's cookies--well, we don't need to tell people in Minnesota."
57:59;58:01;"They know who Sweet Martha is."
58:01;58:07;"Sweet Martha is a chocolate chip cookie brand that at the Minnesota State Fair every year--over what, a one-month period?"
58:07;58:08;"Two weeks."
58:08;58:12;"Two-week period--sells millions and millions of cookies by the bucket."
58:12;58:16;"It is a big part of the Minnesota State Fair culture."
58:16;58:19;"People look forward to those cookies all year round."
58:19;58:21;"And they're only available for two weeks a year."
58:21;58:22;"But something's changing now."
58:22;58:23;"Something's changing."
58:23;58:24;"And we're going to talk to Sweet Martha about it."
58:24;58:25;"Let's get her on the horn."
58:26;58:29;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
58:29;58:32;"[phone ringing]"
58:32;58:33;"Hello?"
58:33;58:34;"Hey, Martha."
58:34;58:35;"Yes."
58:35;58:36;"Hey, it's Jake."
58:36;58:37;"Jake?"
58:37;58:38;"Jake from Time Crisis."
58:38;58:39;"How are you?"
58:39;58:40;"Good, how are you?"
58:40;58:41;"Good, good."
58:41;58:43;"How's everything in L.A.?"
58:43;58:44;"Great."
58:44;58:45;"Terrific."
58:45;58:46;"A little hot, but otherwise great."
58:46;58:47;"This is Ezra here, too."
58:47;58:48;"What's going on in Minnesota?"
58:48;58:49;"What's the weather like?"
58:49;58:50;"Oh, my gosh."
58:50;58:53;"It's the same as you guys, except more humid, probably."
58:53;58:54;"Just super hot."
58:54;58:56;"The whole country's sweltering."
58:56;58:57;"Oh, boy."
58:57;59:00;"How's the prep going for the fair this year?"
59:00;59:01;"Oh, my gosh."
59:01;59:02;"It's going great."
59:02;59:07;"We're in the midst of building a third stand."
59:07;59:08;"Whoa."
59:08;59:10;"On the north end, the fair asked us to do that."
59:10;59:13;"So we're in the midst of that."
59:13;59:16;"We are also remodeling our grandstand booth"
59:16;59:19;"to be able to get a few more servers in there, too."
59:19;59:22;"So everything's like all systems go already."
59:22;59:25;"We started basically in April."
59:25;59:26;"Wow."
59:26;59:27;"So this could be the biggest year ever?"
59:27;59:28;"More hands on deck?"
59:28;59:30;"Well, I hope so."
59:30;59:32;"We hope so, yes."
59:32;59:35;"Are there any, like, metrics that you look--"
59:35;59:36;"or, you know--"
59:36;59:37;"Indicators."
59:37;59:40;"--indicators that you look for, like, in a hot summer,"
59:40;59:42;"do sales go down?"
59:42;59:43;"Do they go up?"
59:43;59:44;"Oh, yeah."
59:44;59:45;"Yeah."
59:45;59:46;"You know what?"
59:46;59:48;"The eating temperature is more 70s, you know?"
59:48;59:52;"The hotter it gets, people basically don't eat."
59:52;59:55;"So we like it when it's cooler."
59:55;59:57;"So nighttime sales are popping."
59:57;59:58;"Exactly."
59:58;01:00:00;"When it starts cooling down, exactly."
01:00:00;01:00:02;"That's very, very true."
01:00:02;01:00:06;"Luckily, because we're at the fair for 12 days,"
01:00:06;01:00:11;"if we have some hot days, usually it isn't that consistent"
01:00:11;01:00:14;"so that we're able to make up for, you know,"
01:00:14;01:00:18;"anything we may have lost during those days where it was really hot."
01:00:18;01:00:19;"Right."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"I heard some news through the grapevine"
01:00:21;01:00:24;"that there's some changes afoot at Sweet Martha's."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"I heard about frozen dough being available at Target."
01:00:27;01:00:30;"Oh, yeah, yes."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"Okay, that is exactly right."
01:00:32;01:00:37;"We have had locally our frozen dough in the store,"
01:00:37;01:00:41;"the Target stores in the five-state area around here."
01:00:41;01:00:46;"Target approached us because they wanted to have a school national"
01:00:46;01:00:48;"with our product."
01:00:48;01:00:51;"The fact of the matter is Target is a local company."
01:00:51;01:00:54;"You know, I think of it as a local company here."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"Minnesota-based, right?"
01:00:56;01:00:57;"Yeah, yeah."
01:00:57;01:01:01;"I actually was in high school, shopped at the very first Target."
01:01:01;01:01:02;"Wow."
01:01:02;01:01:05;"So I really feel there's a soft spot in my heart for Target."
01:01:05;01:01:08;"We normally, you know, we really are a little picky about"
01:01:08;01:01:11;"who we do partnerships with, but with Target coming to us,"
01:01:11;01:01:14;"you know, we had a hard time saying no."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"So this is going to be in just about every Target in America?"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"Well, not quite."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"We sort of held back."
01:01:20;01:01:25;"We wanted to, you know, be a little picky about where we were starting out with,"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"so we'll just see how the waters go."
01:01:27;01:01:30;"We're hoping, you know, eventually that that might happen,"
01:01:30;01:01:35;"but the regular Target stores will have original chocolate chip cookie,"
01:01:35;01:01:39;"and then the super stores will have that original,"
01:01:39;01:01:43;"and they'll also have the double peanut butter chocolate chunk."
01:01:43;01:01:46;"And it's like a really a favorite."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"It sells very well at Target."
01:01:48;01:01:53;"So we actually in our area, we have like five different varieties,"
01:01:53;01:01:58;"oatmeal, one, macadamia nuts, and, you know, five different kinds,"
01:01:58;01:02:05;"whereas Target wanted to--they've been a fan of that peanut butter since day one."
01:02:05;01:02:08;"So the super targets will have those two items."
01:02:08;01:02:11;"But at the fair, it's just a chocolate chip cookie, right?"
01:02:11;01:02:12;"It is. It is."
01:02:12;01:02:15;"That's by far the biggest seller."
01:02:15;01:02:19;"When we first started, I, you know, would talk to people, bakeries,"
01:02:19;01:02:22;"and, you know, what percentage of sell what,"
01:02:22;01:02:26;"and, you know, chocolate chip cookies is by far the most popular."
01:02:26;01:02:31;"So that's where we went with the regular chocolate chip cookie at the fair."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"When is this kicking off?"
01:02:32;01:02:37;"It should actually be hitting some of the stores right now."
01:02:37;01:02:39;"Really? You think we could find it in L.A.?"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"I'm sure hoping so."
01:02:41;01:02:46;"I am not exactly sure of all the stores, but you can find it on our website,"
01:02:46;01:02:48;"you know, sweetmarthas.com."
01:02:48;01:02:54;"We will have a list once we get the list of exactly all the stores that it's going to be in."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"And so some of it is starting now."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"It's going to be in about 1,800 stores."
01:02:58;01:03:06;"They wanted us to start bigger, but we're starting about 1,800 stores to get the first yawn set now."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"How about some Sweet Martha's T-shirts at Target?"
01:03:08;01:03:11;"There we go. I'd love it."
01:03:11;01:03:14;"Yeah, the fashion designers haven't talked to me yet from Target,"
01:03:14;01:03:17;"so we'll see if they want to carry it."
01:03:17;01:03:20;"Because Jake is always rocking his yellow Sweet Martha's shirt."
01:03:20;01:03:21;"It's a staple of his wardrobe."
01:03:21;01:03:22;"Yeah, I wear it a lot."
01:03:22;01:03:26;"Martha, I have to tell you, actually, I was in Rome for my honeymoon."
01:03:26;01:03:30;"I was outside the Vatican City wearing a Sweet Martha's T-shirt,"
01:03:30;01:03:34;"and someone from Minnesota came up and was like, ""Are you from Minnesota?"""
01:03:34;01:03:38;"And I explained the whole thing, that I knew you a little bit, and that--"
01:03:38;01:03:39;"Sure."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"You know, a fan of the shirt, fan of the company."
01:03:41;01:03:45;"But I just thought it was crazy, like across the globe, the Sweet Martha's T-shirt."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"Hey, that would be great."
01:03:46;01:03:49;"You know, when people went on trips from our stand,"
01:03:49;01:03:53;"they would wear their shirt, you know, like in front of the Eiffel Tower,"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"you know, on the London Bridge, and have photos."
01:03:56;01:03:59;"So I should get your photo to put up on our--you know,"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"where the cookie shirt has been."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"That could be a book."
01:04:02;01:04:03;"I'd love it."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Yeah, there you go."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"All right, well, thanks so much, Martha."
01:04:06;01:04:08;"I'm going to go hit Target."
01:04:08;01:04:11;"I still have never tasted a Sweet Martha's cookie."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"Really?"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"Oh, you are a deprived person."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"I know."
01:04:17;01:04:20;"But I wonder if I could bake them correctly at home."
01:04:20;01:04:21;"It's pretty easy."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Oh, I'm sure."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"You just have to know your oven, you know, and sort of--"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"people go, ""Well, how long do you bake them?"""
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I say, ""We just watch them."""
01:04:29;01:04:33;"You know, we work at getting that--we call it perfect pull time"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"when you pull it out of the oven."
01:04:34;01:04:36;"So you really just have to watch."
01:04:36;01:04:41;"The way we do it at the fair is we wait until there's a golden brown ring"
01:04:41;01:04:45;"around the outside, or else those scientists,"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"they call it the shoulder of the cookie."
01:04:48;01:04:49;"What?"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"When your shoulders are golden brown, we pull them out"
01:04:52;01:04:58;"so that the inside is still soft, and then we let them cool on the pan."
01:04:58;01:05:02;"Well, so now we are getting at the grandstand this year"
01:05:02;01:05:05;"where they're finally getting some bands that I actually know."
01:05:05;01:05:06;"Oh, yeah?"
01:05:06;01:05:10;"Yeah, like, you know, Earth, Wind, and Fire and the Beach Boys."
01:05:10;01:05:11;"Oh, wow."
01:05:11;01:05:16;"So I'm just waiting for that Vampire Weekend to be headlining up here"
01:05:16;01:05:17;"when you guys come."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"I'd love to, and we'll bring Jake's Grateful Dead cover band, Richard Pictures,"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"Minnesota State Fair."
01:05:22;01:05:24;"Awesome. Would love to have you come."
01:05:24;01:05:25;"Maybe 2020."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"2020, okay."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"All right, thanks so much, Martha. Have a great summer."
01:05:30;01:05:31;"All right, good luck this summer."
01:05:31;01:05:32;"Thank you so much."

01:06:45;01:06:49;"All right, this week on the Top 5, because this is a prerecord,"
01:06:49;01:06:52;"we're not going to be super up-to-date with the music,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"so we're going to do something special."
01:06:54;01:06:57;"We're going to compare your birth year, Jake, with mine."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"'77 versus '84. '84."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"Two different generations."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"A lot changed between '77 and '84."
01:07:04;01:07:07;"I don't know if we've done too much '84. '84 was a big music year, though."
01:07:07;01:07:11;"Remember we did one that was like Bruce and Tina. It was, like, strong."
01:07:11;01:07:14;"I think we might have a little bit of that again today."
01:07:14;01:07:19;"'77 is generally pretty harsh, although we might get some Eagles."
01:07:19;01:07:25;"It can be pretty cheesy. '77 tends to be the schmaltziest era for the charts."
01:07:25;01:07:29;"Okay, in 1984, my birth year, the number 5 song"
01:07:29;01:07:32;"was Tina Turner, ""What's Love Got to Do With It."""
01:07:32;01:07:34;"Wow, nailed that. Nailed it."
01:07:34;01:07:50;"Great song."
01:07:50;01:07:53;"Do you know that Tina Turner was 44 when this song hit number 1?"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"No, I would not have guessed that."
01:07:55;01:07:59;"At the time, it made her the oldest female solo artist to get a number 1 single."

01:08:13;01:08:17;"Maybe that one with the ABBA sample? ""Hung Up?"""
01:08:42;01:08:45;"So she must have started her career in the early 60s."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"Yeah."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"When she was like 22 in 1962."
01:08:48;01:08:52;"Going around just playing R&Bs, soul reviews and sh*t."
01:08:52;01:08:53;"Wow."
01:08:53;01:08:56;"So much 80s music is like vaguely reggae."

01:18:33;01:18:36;"""And then I came back, giving the power ridden, 'Wild Horse.'"""
01:18:36;01:18:39;"And you're, like, that's crazy, 'cause the truth is"
01:18:39;01:18:44;"very few songs that I've ever been a part of where there was that level."
01:18:44;01:18:47;"And it's cool when it happens, but a lot of times"
01:18:47;01:18:49;"when you, like, write songs with other people, it's also cool,"
01:18:49;01:18:51;"and it's, like, a real creative collaboration,"
01:18:51;01:18:54;"but it's still a lot of times, like, ""Okay, you do this part, I do this part."
01:18:54;01:18:55;"""I'm gonna deal with the lyrics."""
01:18:55;01:18:57;"But to think that they wrote a lot of songs that way."
01:18:57;01:19:00;"- It's crazy. - 'Cause for two guys, again,"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"who maybe have had ups and downs in their relationship,"
01:19:02;01:19:05;"to be so dialed in on the same references and sh--"
01:19:05;01:19:08;"Like, even, like, ""The Dead,"" you know, all those classic songs,"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"- Robert Hunter, the lyricist. - Wrote the lyrics, right."
01:19:10;01:19:13;"I bet Jerry chimed in here and there, like,"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"""Hey, man, maybe change that word."""
01:19:15;01:19:19;"But maybe it's also 'cause the Stones are so, like, badass and, like, swagger,"
01:19:19;01:19:23;"the idea of calling, like, Keith and Mick, like, a poetic team"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"- Right. - just doesn't feel right."
01:19:25;01:19:29;"- But again, like, you think about-- - Yeah, there's zero pretension."
01:19:29;01:19:35;"♪ Wild horses ♪"
01:19:35;01:19:42;"♪ Couldn't drag me away ♪"

01:19:53;01:19:56;"I think there's something to-- I'm trying to think if I read this"
01:19:56;01:20:00;"in Keith's book or in one of the docs or something"
01:20:00;01:20:03;"that's kind of like-- I think maybe Keith would come up with a lot of, like,"
01:20:03;01:20:05;"- the hook concepts. - ♪ Wild horses ♪"
01:20:05;01:20:08;"This is so conceptual. And again, I know maybe for some people who, like,"
01:20:08;01:20:11;"aren't interested in songwriting as much or don't do it,"
01:20:11;01:20:13;"it seems like, ""Well, yeah, that's how I expect all songs written."""
01:20:13;01:20:15;"- But I promise you... - Yeah."
01:20:15;01:20:19;"there aren't that many songs, especially poetic ones."
01:20:19;01:20:22;"I know that there's a lot of, like, pop music-- not that pop can't be poetic--"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"but there's a lot of pop music that's, like, four people in a room"
01:20:24;01:20:28;"and somebody's like, ""I think the hook should be, 'We're gonna party today"
01:20:28;01:20:31;"- because, you know..."" - ""I think the hook should be,"
01:20:31;01:20:33;"- 'Pour some sugar on me.'"" - Yeah."
01:20:33;01:20:37;"But to imagine these two dudes, like, writing these, like, really emotional songs"
01:20:37;01:20:40;"where, like, Keith is like-- I think there is something that, like,"
01:20:40;01:20:44;"Keith or Mick wrote the hook to ""I'll Never Be Your Beast of Burden"""
01:20:44;01:20:47;"'cause one of them was feeling some type of way about the other one"
01:20:47;01:20:50;"and then, like, the other one comes in and writes the verses."
01:20:50;01:20:53;"These guys would come together to write these, like, really beautiful songs"
01:20:53;01:20:56;"that, similar to Robert Hunter, Bob Dylan, whatever,"

01:21:18;01:21:22;"That's what's so good about them, too, is that, kinda like all those other guys,"
01:21:22;01:21:25;"they know the source material inside and out,"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"and they still flip it in a way."
01:21:27;01:21:32;"I think, actually, I kinda wax poetic about The Stones about every 20 episodes on TC."
01:21:32;01:21:34;"- I love it. - I'm pretty sure this isn't the first time."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"There is something, too, that I like about The Stones, like,"
01:21:36;01:21:39;"is it does kinda feel like two people got together and hashed it out."
01:21:39;01:21:41;"There are those, like, weird--"
01:21:41;01:21:44;"People give, like, Leonard Cohen credit for stuff like this, but they do it a lot, too,"
01:21:44;01:21:47;"which is, like, these weird scene shifts."
01:21:47;01:21:49;"I was thinking about, like, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."""
01:21:49;01:21:51;"- Super basic. - I was just thinking that one."
01:21:51;01:21:53;"It's such a basic hook."
01:21:53;01:21:55;"""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometime,"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"you just might find you get what you need."""
01:21:57;01:21:59;"That could be a folk song. It's simple. It's to the point."
01:21:59;01:22:01;"It's great, but it's very simple."
01:22:01;01:22:03;"And then just, like, on the verses..."
01:22:03;01:22:08;"♪ I saw her today at the reception ♪"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"I love that he says ""reception."""
01:22:10;01:22:15;"♪ A glass of wine in her hand ♪"
01:22:15;01:22:21;"♪ I knew she was gonna meet her connection ♪"
01:22:21;01:22:27;"♪ At her feet was a footloose man ♪"

01:22:48;01:22:52;"♪ You might find you get what you need ♪"
01:22:52;01:22:55;"So anyway, state of shock."
01:22:55;01:22:57;"Mick's not a writer on it."
01:22:57;01:23:00;"- But look, even-- - 13 years after ""Wild Horses."""
01:23:00;01:23:01;"- Yep. - Isn't that funny?"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"Like, ""Oh, yeah, that song I wrote 13 years ago."""
01:23:03;01:23:05;"It's, like, such a weird span of time."
01:23:05;01:23:07;"- Right. - It's not--I mean,"
01:23:07;01:23:10;"is ""Wild Horses"" like a classic in 1984?"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"'Cause it's, like--I think it was, but it's, like--"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"- To their fans. - But it's sort of like a song--"
01:23:14;01:23:18;"I guess, yeah, it could be, like, a song from, like, the 2000--"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"- Five. - I can't do math."
01:23:19;01:23:21;"- 2005. - Yeah, like a song from 2005."
01:23:21;01:23:25;"Like, ""Oh, yeah, that beautiful ballad I wrote in 2005"
01:23:25;01:23:27;"- that we recorded in Russell Shoals."" - Right."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"Vamper Week is not quite there yet."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"Well, even then, in 13 years--"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"No, no, in a couple years, I'll be able to be like,"
01:23:32;01:23:34;"""Yeah, 13 years ago was the first album."""
01:23:34;01:23:36;"- Yeah. - That'll be funny when it's, like,"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"13 years on from, like, modern vampires."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"But I wonder if in '84--"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"'Cause, like, we hear ""Wild Horses"" and we're like,"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"""Oh, yeah, the '70s, man, like, tasteful palette."""
01:23:44;01:23:46;"- Yeah, right. - It's so--like, muscle Shoals,"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"like, the whole nine yards."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"But in '84, I wonder if it was like,"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"""Yeah, the recordings back in 1971."""
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Like, I don't know, it sounds pretty, like--"
01:23:54;01:23:55;"- A lot of hiss. - Yeah."
01:23:55;01:23:57;"Well, Mick is on record as saying that"
01:23:57;01:24:00;"he didn't understand what the whole fuss about ""Exile"" was."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"And he was like, ""I guess I can kinda see"
01:24:02;01:24:03;"that it's got a certain sound."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"I just don't think it's a particularly well-recorded album."""
01:24:05;01:24:07;"- Right. - Which also might have been"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"just some, like, shade at Keith."
01:24:08;01:24:10;"'Cause I think Keith is kinda the boss of that album."
01:24:10;01:24:12;"Maybe also Mick likes to slam-dunk it"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"with number one singles and [bleep]"
01:24:14;01:24:15;"- Right. - There's no, like,"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"""Start Me Up"" on ""Exile."""
01:24:17;01:24:19;"- No. - So, yeah, Mick is kinda like,"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"""Yeah, 'Exile' is, like, a kinda messy lo-fi record."""
01:24:22;01:24:24;"- It's like the basement tapes or something."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"- Yeah. - He wants to listen to that."
01:24:26;01:24:28;"- Yeah, so he clearly doesn't love that one."
01:24:28;01:24:30;"But, yeah, Mick in '84--the one thing I was gonna say"
01:24:30;01:24:33;"is picturing Mick being kinda jealous of Michael"
01:24:33;01:24:36;"or just noting Michael, we don't know for sure."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"But one thing that's interesting--"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"and I talk about this a lot with Dave from Chromio"
01:24:41;01:24:42;"'cause we're both Mick heads,"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"and we love to look at his fashion throughout the ages."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"- Hmm. - And we were always obsessed"
01:24:46;01:24:49;"with his early '80s look because that was the era--"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"I guess it was half as a joke,"
01:24:51;01:24:54;"but also as, like, this weird way to just still stay, like,"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"young and wacky and fresh, that in the early '80s,"
01:24:56;01:24:59;"when they started playing football stadiums,"
01:24:59;01:25:01;"he would always wear, like, football pants."
01:25:01;01:25:03;"You know, like, those weird little, like, zip-up things?"
01:25:03;01:25:05;"- Oh, whoa. Like the pads on the thighs?"
01:25:05;01:25:06;"- With the pads on the thighs."
01:25:06;01:25:07;"And, you know, he's super skinny,"
01:25:07;01:25:10;"so it's, like, this really tight, weird football thing."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"And he'd wear the craziest color shirts."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"So he's, like, in his early 40s at this point,"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"and he's, like, taking the fashion"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"almost to a new level of, like, wackiness."
01:25:18;01:25:21;"- I love that thing when rock stars do that,"
01:25:21;01:25:23;"like, with, like, sports in particular,"
01:25:23;01:25:26;"like Axl Rose wearing the, like, catchers."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"- Oh, yeah."
01:25:28;01:25:30;"- Didn't he wear, like, a catcher's, like--"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- Yeah."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- Like, what is that, like, the chest and, like,"
01:25:32;01:25:33;"groin protector? - Yeah."
01:25:33;01:25:34;"That was hilarious."
01:25:34;01:25:36;"- Like, Axl would be, like, doing, like,"
01:25:36;01:25:40;"a dead-ass wind sprint across, like, a 200-yard stage."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"- Yeah."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"- Wearing, like, a catcher's protective gear."
01:25:43;01:25:44;"- Yeah."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"- Holding a mic stand."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"- You know what's funny? - Steven Stills, too."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"- What would he wear? A catcher's?"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"- No, he would wear football jerseys."
01:25:50;01:25:51;"- Oh, football jerseys."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"- Did weird do that?"
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Maybe not."
01:25:54;01:25:55;"- Might have here and there."
01:25:55;01:25:56;"Drummer from Dave Matthews' band"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"was always wearing hockey jerseys."
01:25:58;01:25:59;"[laughter]"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- I'm sure other people have done this,"
01:26:01;01:26:03;"but I bought a couple on eBay recently,"
01:26:03;01:26:05;"just browsing, thinking about new looks,"
01:26:05;01:26:10;"and I came across funny vintage cycling shirts."
01:26:10;01:26:12;"You know, kind of like-- - Like, tight."
01:26:12;01:26:14;"- Tight-ish, but whatever you call that,"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"like, whatever kind of stretchy material."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"- Like spandex?"
01:26:17;01:26:19;"- In the spandex family."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"I found this really weird L.L. Bean one"
01:26:21;01:26:23;"that looks like it's from the '80s."
01:26:23;01:26:24;"- This is a strong look."
01:26:24;01:26:25;"- Yeah, 'cause it's, like--"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"it's not that different than just wearing, like,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"a patterned T-shirt, but it's different enough--"
01:26:29;01:26:30;"- Right."
01:26:30;01:26:31;"- That people would just be like, ""All right."""
01:26:31;01:26:34;"- I liked your look the other night at the show."
01:26:34;01:26:36;"You were wearing, like, track pants."
01:26:36;01:26:37;"- Oh, yeah."
01:26:37;01:26:39;"- And then just, like, kind of a baggy long-sleeve tee."
01:26:39;01:26:40;"- I was going-- - People were commenting on it."
01:26:40;01:26:41;"- Oh, yeah?"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"- Like, ""Ezra's look is interesting."""
01:26:42;01:26:43;"- All right, tight."
01:26:43;01:26:45;"- And I was like--I was like, ""I'm into it."""
01:26:45;01:26:47;"People were sort of, like, didn't know what to think."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"- Right."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"- And I was sort of like, ""What are you supposed to do?"""
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Like, so many rock stars in their 30s,"
01:26:51;01:26:53;"like, dress like they're art dealers,"
01:26:53;01:26:55;"like, wearing, like, a nice blazer"
01:26:55;01:26:56;"and, like, brand-new sneakers."
01:26:56;01:26:57;"- Right."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- I'm just like, ""Come on."""
01:26:58;01:27:00;"That's, like--that's not fun."
01:27:00;01:27:02;"It's not, like--it's not exciting and funny and fun."
01:27:02;01:27:04;"- You got to do something fun."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"- Yeah."
01:27:05;01:27:07;"- Yeah, I'm--you know, I'm obsessed with aging gracefully,"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"but that's what's weird."
01:27:08;01:27:11;"Part of aging gracefully is not being too graceful."
01:27:11;01:27:12;"- Right."
01:27:12;01:27:13;"- And also, that was kind of like me getting back"
01:27:13;01:27:15;"to, like, some '90s sh--, my roots."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"- Yeah."
01:27:16;01:27:19;"- I had, like, big T-shirt over a big long-sleeve,"
01:27:19;01:27:21;"track pants, Paramax 97s."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"- Baggy look."
01:27:23;01:27:24;"- Baggy look."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"I'll do some more streamlined looks,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"but got a lot of figuring out to do this summer."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- Got to keep working out."
01:27:28;01:27:29;"- Oh, yeah, I do."
01:27:29;01:27:30;"- You have those carbs, dude."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"- Yeah, I know."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"These donuts--I just crushed two donuts."
01:27:32;01:27:35;"- If you're gonna be rocking those Spandex bike shirts--"
01:27:35;01:27:36;"- I know. I got one--"
01:27:36;01:27:39;"- Got to get that BMI down to 19 or so, 18?"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"- I got one really tight bike shirt."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"I got it because, like, the branding on it was hilarious."
01:27:44;01:27:48;"It was, like, ""Power Bar, Volvic Water, Subaru."""
01:27:48;01:27:49;"[laughter]"
01:27:49;01:27:52;"- That's almost Axl Rose level."
01:27:52;01:27:53;"- Yeah, I know, but--"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"- In terms of weird stage look."
01:27:54;01:27:56;"- But that one's, like, super tight,"
01:27:56;01:27:58;"so I'd really need to lay off the carbs to pull it off."
01:27:58;01:27:59;"- Oh, my God."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"- This LLB one is not super branded out."
01:28:01;01:28:02;"It's kind of more mellow."
01:28:02;01:28:05;"It is just more of, like, a, ""What kind of shirt is that?"""

01:37:24;01:37:26;"I don't know. - A load of bread?"
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Who says that? - Ackroyd says that to Murray."
01:37:28;01:37:30;"- Yeah. - This ectocontainment system"
01:37:30;01:37:32;"that Spengler and I have in mind"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"is gonna cost a load of bread to capitalize."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"- How many times do you think you've seen ""Ghostbusters""?"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"- 80. - Oh, sh--"
01:37:38;01:37:39;"- I have no idea. I mean, it's one of those--"
01:37:39;01:37:41;"you know when you're a kid, and maybe you didn't have"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"this experience? - You watch the same video"
01:37:42;01:37:43;"over and over again? - Yeah."
01:37:43;01:37:46;"Or, like, we'd, like, rent a video on a Friday night."
01:37:46;01:37:48;"We'd watch the movie, and then the next morning,"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"just watch it again. - Right."
01:37:50;01:37:53;"- And then we had ""Ghostbusters"" and probably watched that,"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"like, once a week for, like, years."
01:37:56;01:37:58;"And then in high school, like, me and a few buddies"
01:37:58;01:38:00;"all had it memorized. - Right."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"- So it just was, like, constant--"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"- Did you ever work to memorize it?"
01:38:03;01:38:06;"- No. But see, if you're riffing on the movie"
01:38:06;01:38:09;"with your buddies, and then they're saying lines,"
01:38:09;01:38:10;"then that makes you remember even more."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"- Right. - And actually,"
01:38:11;01:38:13;"my high school yearbook quote was from ""Ghostbusters."""
01:38:13;01:38:16;"- What was it? - ""Slow down. Chew your food."""
01:38:16;01:38:18;"- Who says that? - Venkman."
01:38:18;01:38:20;"- To a ghost? - No, he says it to Ackroyd."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"It's, like, right when the business is getting off"
01:38:22;01:38:23;"the ground, and they're just, like,"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"wailing on Chinese food. - [laughs]"
01:38:25;01:38:27;"- And they're, like, stressed about the business"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"not taking off. It's before the ghosts"
01:38:29;01:38:30;"have, like, taken over Manhattan."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"- Right. - And Ackroyd's just, like,"
01:38:32;01:38:33;"stressed out and eating, and then Venkman's just like,"
01:38:33;01:38:35;"""Hey, hey, slow down. Chew your food."""
01:38:35;01:38:37;"- That's Bill Murray. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"Venkman, yeah. - So did you quote it as--"
01:38:39;01:38:42;"- Dr. Peter Venkman. - Dr. Ven-- [laughs]"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"- But you know what? It's, like, a throwaway line"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"in the movie. It's a very subtle,"
01:38:46;01:38:48;"slightly humorous line in the movie."
01:38:48;01:38:49;"It's not, like, an iconic line."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"But as a high school yearbook quote..."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"- Yeah. - It goes deep."
01:38:53;01:38:54;"- Right. - I mean, it's great advice."
01:38:54;01:38:56;"- Right, yeah. - ""Slow down. Chew your food."""
01:38:56;01:38:58;"- It's multi-layered. - And actually, I've kind of"
01:38:58;01:39:01;"lived my life by that credo. - Really?"
01:39:01;01:39:03;"I can't believe we never got into this before."
01:39:03;01:39:05;"- ""Slow down. Chew your food."" I mean, it's just, like,"
01:39:05;01:39:08;"it's all good. Slow down. - And that's specific advice"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"for when you're in a stressful situation?"
01:39:10;01:39:12;"- Yeah, it's literal advice... - Right."
01:39:12;01:39:14;"- On how to eat properly. - Right."
01:39:14;01:39:17;"- But it's also--yeah, it's, like, a philosophical outlook,"
01:39:17;01:39:18;"right? ""Slow down. Chew your food."""
01:39:18;01:39:20;"Don't flip out. - Right."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"- Don't stress out. Take your time."
01:39:22;01:39:24;"Think it through. Be patient. - It's a little bit like,"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"""Don't sweat the small stuff."""
01:39:26;01:39:28;"Then in parentheses, it's all small stuff."
01:39:28;01:39:30;"- Yeah, it's kind of like that. - It's very zen."
01:39:30;01:39:32;"- But it's funnier. - It's very zen, too."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"- For sure. - I think of references on the show,"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"like, these zen comics I had as a kid that would tell--"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"like, using the language of comic books,"
01:39:39;01:39:42;"kind of tell classic stories about zen monks"
01:39:42;01:39:44;"and how they reached enlightenment."
01:39:44;01:39:46;"And, you know, the story is they always go to the master"
01:39:46;01:39:48;"all hyper, stressed out."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"""I need to figure out how to do this."
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Show me how to do this."" And the master--"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"and this also happens in kung fu movies all the time."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"The master's like, ""Okay, go do that simple task."
01:39:56;01:39:58;"Go sweep up."" And he's like, ""What?"""
01:39:58;01:40:00;"Actually, there's this-- - Wax on, wax off."
01:40:00;01:40:02;"- You know what? I actually think of movies that I've seen--"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"I don't think I've seen anything 80 times, but maybe, like,"
01:40:04;01:40:07;"my dad had a VHS of this kung fu movie"
01:40:07;01:40:09;"called ""Return of the Master Killer"""
01:40:09;01:40:12;"with Gordon Liu. - Don't know it."
01:40:12;01:40:14;"- It's like, you know, that-- - '70s?"
01:40:14;01:40:16;"- It's definitely '70s."
01:40:16;01:40:19;"They--in New York, they always showed kung fu movies"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"on Channel 5."
01:40:21;01:40:23;"It was like this thing, Channel 5 movies,"
01:40:23;01:40:25;"you know, with, like, the terrible dubbing and stuff."
01:40:25;01:40:27;"And there's a lot of movies like this,"
01:40:27;01:40:29;"but in ""Return of the Master Killer"" specifically,"
01:40:29;01:40:31;"there's, like, this con man who gets run out of town,"
01:40:31;01:40:33;"and he ends up at the Shaolin Temple,"
01:40:33;01:40:35;"and he really wants to learn to do kung fu,"
01:40:35;01:40:37;"and the master's basically like, ""No, dude."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"I'm not ready to teach you, but you know what?"
01:40:39;01:40:41;"We could use some scaffolding around the place."
01:40:41;01:40:43;"Why don't you help us put up scaffolding?"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"Go take the big, long things of bamboo,"
01:40:45;01:40:47;"tie 'em up with some straw or whatever,"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"and, you know, put up scaffolding."""
01:40:49;01:40:51;"Then he's, like, pissed or whatever,"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"and he's like, ""Fine."" Years go by,"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"he's putting up the scaffolding. Little by little, he's, like,"
01:40:55;01:40:57;"getting used to it, and he's, like, kicking up a bamboo pole"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"with his foot and then grabbing it in the air and putting it--"
01:40:59;01:41:01;"- Uh-huh. - And then it's, like, this whole thing"
01:41:01;01:41:03;"that by the end of it,"
01:41:03;01:41:06;"he has become this, like, sick fighter,"
01:41:06;01:41:09;"and then he comes back to the town he got run out of,"
01:41:09;01:41:11;"and he beats up all, like, the bad dudes,"
01:41:11;01:41:13;"and he's doing all this, like, crazy scaffolding sh--,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"like, using the pole to beat the sh-- out of people,"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"and then, like, tying their hands behind their back."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"- Uh-huh. - And it's, like, that same thing."
01:41:19;01:41:22;"I'm just like, ""Yeah, chill out. Focus on simple tasks,"
01:41:22;01:41:24;"and, you know, slow and steady wins the race,"" kind of."
01:41:24;01:41:26;"I guess there's a lot of adjacent..."
01:41:26;01:41:28;"- Tortoise and the hare. - Tortoise and the hare."
01:41:28;01:41:31;"Yeah, like, nobody benefits from freaking out."
01:41:31;01:41:33;"Control the things you can."

01:41:35;01:41:37;"You know what my high school yearbook quote was?"
01:41:37;01:41:39;"- I don't. - We talked about this."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"It was, ""Do you love me? Do you, surfer girl?"""
01:41:41;01:41:42;"[laughter]"
01:41:42;01:41:44;"Which I credited to Brian Wilson."
01:41:44;01:41:46;"- Of course he did. - Upon reflection,"
01:41:46;01:41:48;"I don't even know if he necessarily wrote the lyric."
01:41:48;01:41:50;"Yeah, I think I wrote, ""Do you love me?"
01:41:50;01:41:52;"Do you...surfer girl?"""
01:41:52;01:41:54;"- Question mark. - It probably would've been"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"more appropriate, ""Do you, surfer girl?"""
01:41:56;01:41:58;"There's something about the dot-dot-dot."

01:42:00;01:42:03;"""Do you...surfer girl?"""
01:42:03;01:42:05;"So were you doing it as, like, pure joke,"

01:42:09;01:42:11;"No, I don't think-- I wasn't even, like,"

01:42:13;01:42:15;"and there's definitely no, like, double meaning,"
