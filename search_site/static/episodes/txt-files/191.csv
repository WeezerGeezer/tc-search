00:00;00:05;"Time Crisis. Once again."
00:05;00:08;"What's in a name?"
00:08;00:10;"What if that name is Dave?"
00:10;00:13;"There's a lot of Daves."
00:13;00:16;"But there's only one we're talking to today."
00:16;00:19;"One of the greatest. Dave Matthews."
00:19;00:22;"We'll dig into his life, career,"
00:22;00:25;"some of his favorite snacks, and so much more."
00:25;00:30;"On Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:20;"Time Crisis. Back again."
01:20;01:23;"Oh boy, do we have a good one today."
01:23;01:25;"Can you believe this, fellas?"
01:25;01:28;"We've got the legendary Dave Matthews"
01:28;01:32;"of the Dave Matthews Band coming on the program."
01:32;01:35;"That's a big get. It's a major get."
01:35;01:38;"We've had many illustrious guests on this program."
01:38;01:41;"Although the truth is, one thing I like about TC"
01:41;01:45;"is it's not a guest-heavy show."
01:45;01:48;"Right, there'll be no guests for several episodes"
01:48;01:51;"and then we'll have Rod Stewart."
01:51;01:53;"[laughter]"
01:53;01:56;"We'll have a friend of mine call in to promote their record,"
01:56;02:01;"like Dear Nora, or Aaron Olson from LA Takedown/Mountain Brews."
02:01;02:03;"And then we'll have Rod Stewart call in."
02:03;02:06;"It either has to be somebody with a personal connection."
02:06;02:09;"Look, at Time Crisis we're storytellers"
02:09;02:13;"and we're looking for unique voices in these challenging times"
02:13;02:15;"with interesting stories to tell."
02:15;02:19;"And I don't care if you're Rod Stewart or Winter,"
02:19;02:22;"the King of Starbucking, or the Starbuck King,"
02:22;02:24;"those are interesting stories."
02:24;02:26;"We don't want anybody caught in the middle."
02:26;02:29;"We want somebody who's had an interesting life"
02:29;02:31;"and something cool to say."
02:31;02:34;"You might be Peter Gill from second grade"
02:34;02:36;"telling us about your days as a lobsterman."
02:36;02:39;"I still think about that. That pops into my head."
02:39;02:42;"Him and his buddies just living on this island, cold as hell."
02:42;02:46;"Catching lobsters, making indie rock, moving to Philly."
02:46;02:48;"It's a great story."
02:48;02:50;"As long as you've got an interesting story to tell."
02:50;02:51;"It could be Johnny Marr."
02:51;02:53;"Oh yeah, that was a good one."
02:53;02:54;"That was a good one, yeah."
02:54;02:56;"You could be Johnny Marr from The Smiths"
02:56;03:00;"the guy who makes Flaming Hot Cheetos bagels in New Jersey"
03:00;03:02;"that we interviewed like five years ago."
03:02;03:06;"I think we might be the most egalitarian internet radio show."
03:06;03:09;"As far as guests are concerned, you could be anybody"
03:09;03:11;"as long as you've got an interesting story."
03:11;03:13;"That's right. You can come from any walk of life."
03:13;03:15;"TC will have you."
03:15;03:18;"But also, luckily we enjoy each other's company."
03:18;03:21;"And we can go."
03:21;03:23;"The truth is, Time Crisis is the rare--"
03:23;03:24;"Now we're rambling."
03:24;03:27;"I think Time Crisis is the rare show that it could go--"
03:27;03:30;"We could literally go three years without a single guest."
03:30;03:33;"It would not change the vibe of the show at all."
03:33;03:34;"True."
03:34;03:35;"And then one day they're just like,"
03:35;03:38;"""Hey, you guys want to have Obama on?"""
03:38;03:39;"And we'd be like, ""All right, sure."""
03:39;03:41;"But does he have an interesting story to tell?"
03:41;03:45;"Yeah, actually, I would kick the tires on that."
03:45;03:46;"I think we've heard everything."
03:46;03:48;"We know it all. Come on, man."
03:48;03:51;"Anyway, we've got Dave Matthews coming through."
03:51;03:53;"He'll be on later in the program."
03:53;03:55;"Very excited to talk about him."
03:55;03:57;"Now, it's kind of interesting,"
03:57;04:00;"because Jake, you don't know a whole lot about Dave."
04:00;04:03;"I think I've listened to Dave Matthews"
04:03;04:07;"maybe three hours total in my life."
04:07;04:08;"And that means--"
04:08;04:10;"One three-hour show?"
04:10;04:12;"I've never seen him live."
04:12;04:14;"And I've never listened to an album."
04:14;04:17;"I've heard his songs, like his hits."
04:17;04:19;"♪ What would you say? ♪"
04:19;04:20;"Classic."
04:20;04:21;"It's in the ether."
04:21;04:24;"And then one time on a drive with Hannah,"
04:24;04:27;"she really liked DMB back in the day,"
04:27;04:28;"like high school, college era."
04:28;04:29;"Yeah."
04:29;04:32;"I guess this would be late '90s, early '02s."
04:32;04:34;"We were on a drive in rural California"
04:34;04:35;"up in the Sierra Nevada,"
04:35;04:37;"and we listened to Dave Matthews"
04:37;04:39;"for like an hour and a half."
04:39;04:40;"Well, you know what it was?"
04:40;04:42;"We found the Dave Matthews station,"
04:42;04:45;"and we listened to it for quite a while."
04:45;04:47;"And she was like, ""Man, this is bringing me back."""
04:47;04:49;"And did they just play a full show?"
04:49;04:50;"I think it was."
04:50;04:53;"I think we listened to a big sequence of a show."
04:53;04:55;"Maybe we caught the last half of a show,"
04:55;04:58;"and then it just kind of was playing random songs."
04:58;05:00;"You know, like on the Sirius dead station."
05:00;05:01;"They'll jump around sometimes."
05:01;05:02;"They'll play a whole show,"
05:02;05:05;"and then it'll start playing random studio tracks."
05:05;05:08;"Like, ""Oh, studio version of 'Touch of Gray'?"
05:08;05:09;"Cool, I'm down."""
05:09;05:10;"Well, yeah, I think it's interesting"
05:10;05:13;"because this is where our age difference,"
05:13;05:16;"small age difference between us and Nick too,"
05:16;05:17;"really plays a role."
05:17;05:21;"'Cause Jake, yeah, you were born in '77."
05:21;05:25;"So by the time Dave Matthews really broke out,"
05:25;05:27;"like became a massive band in the mid '90s,"
05:27;05:29;"you're already in college."
05:29;05:31;"You're on the West Coast."
05:31;05:33;"Well, I started college in '95."
05:33;05:37;"Yeah, probably senior year of high school, 1994."
05:37;05:38;"That was their first record,"
05:38;05:39;"""Under the Table"" and ""Dreaming."""
05:39;05:40;"Is that right?"
05:40;05:41;"Yeah, that came out in '94."
05:41;05:44;"I don't remember Dave Matthews crossing my desk"
05:44;05:45;"in high school."
05:45;05:48;"Yeah, whereas Nick, you were born in 1980?"
05:48;05:50;"'79, but yeah."
05:50;05:52;"Those two years made a big difference,"
05:52;05:54;"being in high school on the East Coast."
05:54;05:57;"I mean, Dave Matthews is a global phenomenon"
05:57;05:59;"and big all across America."
05:59;06:01;"But there is something, especially for you, Nick,"
06:01;06:05;"growing up in close to Virginia in Washington, D.C."
06:05;06:06;"Yeah."
06:06;06:07;"You were in the epicenter of it."
06:07;06:10;"So I'm curious for you, being a little bit younger,"
06:10;06:11;"being closer to Virginia,"
06:11;06:13;"when did DMB cross your desk?"
06:13;06:16;"Probably, I mean, you know,"
06:16;06:19;"I was big in the lot scene of DMB,"
06:19;06:23;"probably '95, '96, '97."
06:23;06:25;"Really, as I went to college in '98."
06:25;06:27;"But those like junior,"
06:27;06:29;"like sophomore, junior, senior year of high school,"
06:29;06:32;"I was very into DMB."
06:32;06:33;"Went to a lot of shows."
06:33;06:34;"Maybe--"
06:34;06:35;"How many?"
06:35;06:37;"Definitely over 10, maybe close to 20."
06:37;06:39;"I mean, I would go, you know,"
06:39;06:41;"he was playing a lot around then."
06:41;06:43;"And I-- but I found--"
06:43;06:47;"I came in through it through a cousin of mine"
06:47;06:49;"who lived in Manhattan."
06:49;06:54;"And it was like an upper east side apartment kind of dude"
06:54;06:57;"who was very-- he was very into jazz."
06:57;07:01;"And he was very into the DMB tapes, like live tapes."
07:01;07:04;"And I had been into the dead, and I, you know,"
07:04;07:07;"as you know, I saw one of Jerry's last shows."
07:07;07:09;"And so I got-- and that was right when I was getting into the dead."
07:09;07:12;"So I got to see absolute tail end,"
07:12;07:15;"and I think there might have been some kind of, you know,"
07:15;07:20;"hole that was left in my heart for, you know, live shows and tapes."
07:20;07:22;"And then when this cousin of mine was like,"
07:22;07:25;"""Oh, DMB has a very similar scene to, you know,"
07:25;07:27;"the tape scene for the dead."""
07:27;07:29;"And he had, I don't know, 15, 20 tapes."
07:29;07:30;"I mean, this is '95."
07:30;07:32;"So I mean, they'd already been--"
07:32;07:34;"I mean, I guess his first album had come out."
07:34;07:37;"But I feel like no one liked the dead."
07:37;07:40;"No one was-- he wasn't listening to the studio album."
07:40;07:42;"He was listening to live tapes."
07:42;07:45;"And so I remember being in, like, an Upper East Side apartment"
07:45;07:47;"and him playing me all of this stuff."
07:47;07:50;"And I think he might have been, like, a jazz guitarist or something,"
07:50;07:51;"my cousin."
07:51;07:58;"But he was very into, like, the jammy jazz influence of DMB."
07:58;08:00;"So I started then going to a lot of shows."
08:00;08:04;"I love that image of being introduced on the Upper East Side."
08:04;08:08;"I'm picturing your cousin like a Whit Stillman character"
08:08;08:11;"and just going up to the Upper East Side apartment and be like,"
08:11;08:14;"""You know, my little cousin, there's some really interesting music"
08:14;08:17;"coming out of Northern Virginia."
08:17;08:18;"Why don't you sit down for a second?"
08:18;08:19;"I'll play you some."
08:19;08:22;"And then we'll go take a walk in Central Park."""
08:22;08:23;"[MUSIC - THE BATS, ""SATELLITE""]"
08:23;08:31;"Satellite in my eyes like a diamond in the sky."
08:31;08:39;"How I wonder if satellites strung from the moon"
08:39;08:48;"and the world you hold below will be built on for the mother station."
08:48;08:58;"Winter's cold, spring rages, and the cold wave"
08:58;09:06;"by the storm is chasin' everything but me drawn placing."
09:06;09:11;"Long I've longed and long I've longed,"
09:11;09:13;"Satellite."
09:13;09:15;"And so he took me to some shows."
09:15;09:17;"I can't remember where the first ones were,"
09:17;09:19;"but I went and saw, like, a handful of shows"
09:19;09:22;"in Merriweather Post Pavilion, which I think you've probably played at."
09:22;09:24;"You know, they were playing a lot of, like, outdoor amphitheaters."
09:24;09:26;"And I got so into them."
09:26;09:28;"You guys know, and I don't think I've ever mentioned on the show,"
09:28;09:31;"that I started selling--"
09:31;09:33;"I had drawn these Calvin and Hobbes shirts."
09:33;09:36;"I think it was, like-- it would be Calvin and Hobbes,"
09:36;09:38;"and they were walking with a balloon."
09:38;09:42;"And it said, ""Just say no,"" with, like, a little ""to"" for nitrous oxide."
09:42;09:43;"You designed that shirt?"
09:43;09:45;"I started silk-screening shirts that I would sell"
09:45;09:47;"that would have Calvin and Hobbes that I drew,"
09:47;09:50;"and it would just say, ""N20,"" like, ""Just say no,"""
09:50;09:52;"but with, like, Calvin and Hobbes walking with--"
09:52;09:53;"holding a nitrous balloon."
09:53;09:55;"Oh, ""Just say N20."""
09:55;09:57;"Yeah, for the nitrous oxide."
09:57;09:59;"Nitrous oxide."
09:59;10:01;"That's pretty witty. You came up with that yourself?"
10:01;10:05;"I must have, yeah, unless I saw it on some other, you know, dead shirt somewhere."
10:05;10:09;"I can't-- there was, like, no internet for me to have, like, been influenced by,"
10:09;10:11;"so I must have come up with that on my own."
10:11;10:14;"And so you just drew Calvin and Hobbes by hand?"
10:14;10:16;"I would draw Calvin and Hobbes-- no, it was literally--"
10:16;10:17;"I think it was a shot from the book."
10:17;10:19;"Right, you didn't have access to Photoshop."
10:19;10:22;"Yeah, I couldn't have printed it, so I drew Calvin and Hobbes by hand,"
10:22;10:25;"and they were just walking in the center of the shirt,"
10:25;10:28;"and it said, ""Just say no,"" with a little ""2"" for the nitrous oxide,"
10:28;10:30;"for, like, the chemical, you know."
10:30;10:32;"How many do you think you printed over the years?"
10:32;10:33;"Maybe 100."
10:33;10:36;"We need to put out an APB to see if--"
10:36;10:38;"If anyone can find this shirt online."
10:38;10:39;"If anybody can find one."
10:39;10:42;"But, yeah, it was one color, silkscreened at my school."
10:42;10:43;"It's on Etsy."
10:43;10:44;"Is there one?"
10:44;10:45;"Wait."
10:45;10:46;"No."
10:46;10:47;"Calvin and Hobbes just say no?"
10:47;10:48;"Yeah."
10:48;10:49;"This is different than what I drew."
10:49;10:52;"So someone-- I mean, maybe this was in the ether,"
10:52;10:55;"because what you're showing me is just straight up a drawing of Calvin"
10:55;10:57;"doing a giant whippet out of a balloon."
10:57;10:58;"Wait."
10:58;10:59;"Mine was a little more--"
10:59;11:01;"Mine was just--"
11:01;11:02;"Yours had Calvin and Hobbes."
11:02;11:04;"--I don't want to say more subtle, but, you know,"
11:04;11:08;"it was Calvin and Hobbes walking and was holding a balloon."
11:08;11:10;"And I don't know if I drew that off of, like,"
11:10;11:13;"one of my old Calvin and Hobbes books or if I made that up,"
11:13;11:16;"but it was definitely, like-- it was a little more PG than this one."
11:16;11:17;"Right."
11:17;11:23;"So people were just ripping nitrous shots in the parking lot at the DMV shows."
11:23;11:24;"Oh, yeah."
11:24;11:25;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
11:25;11:27;"And, I mean, they definitely seemed like a kinder vibe,"
11:27;11:29;"because I also had gone to fish shows in high school, and, I mean,"
11:29;11:31;"I just-- those were harsher."
11:31;11:33;"I mean, just, like, the drug scene was harsher."
11:33;11:37;"This was definitely people whippets, getting high, probably eating mushrooms,"
11:37;11:41;"but something about the shows in '94, '95, maybe just because it was--"
11:41;11:43;"it also felt younger."
11:43;11:45;"You know, when I went to fish shows, there'd be old heads,"
11:45;11:47;"and certainly at the Dead shows there were old heads."
11:47;11:50;"This was definitely just sort of, like, a lot of beer drinking."
11:50;11:52;"It definitely had a frat vibe, too."
11:52;11:53;"Interesting."
11:53;11:56;"I thought of DMV as the more, like, preppy, like--"
11:56;11:58;"Yes, they were known for getting more preppy, too,"
11:58;12:05;"but also you just got to remember, DMV is one of the biggest American bands"
12:05;12:07;"of the era, and they still are."
12:07;12:09;"Still one of the biggest touring acts."
12:09;12:14;"So, like, it was-- as much as people might try to say, like,"
12:14;12:18;"""Oh, the typical DMV fan in the '90s,"" like, depending on where you're from,"
12:18;12:21;"maybe there's-- yeah, ""Oh, kind of like a preppy dude,"
12:21;12:24;"smokes a little bit of weed, not like a burnout,"""
12:24;12:28;"but that's a stereotype of a '90s DMV fan."
12:28;12:31;"But they're also just so massive, selling millions of records."
12:31;12:34;"They were playing stadiums at a certain point in the '90s."
12:34;12:37;"So when you're talking about that many people,"
12:37;12:41;"you're getting every walk of life rolling up to the show."
12:41;12:47;"There aren't enough actually preppy people in America to fill Giant Stadium."
12:47;12:50;"There's not enough guys wearing polo shirts and drinking gin and tonics"
12:50;12:52;"to fill Giant Stadium."
12:52;12:55;"Exactly, and actually, as I say, that's also always been my argument"
12:55;12:56;"with Vampire Weekend."
12:56;12:58;"We never played Giant Stadium."
12:58;13:00;"Did it's all at the Garden once."
13:00;13:03;"And then I've always been like, ""How many truly preppy people"
13:03;13:05;"are there in America?"""
13:05;13:09;"I'd say there's 8,000 true hardcore preps."
13:09;13:12;"And then if you really start to have a broader definition,"
13:12;13:17;"let's say like 50,000 preppy people."
13:17;13:21;"You're not selling out shows across this great land of ours"
13:21;13:23;"if you can only reach the preps."
13:23;13:26;"True for VW and obviously true for a massive--"
13:26;13:30;"Speaking of preps, there's some guy on a dirt bike in the parking lot"
13:30;13:34;"outside my door just revving his bike and just doing wheelies"
13:34;13:36;"in the parking lot."
13:36;13:37;"Wow, I heard it for a second."
13:37;13:38;"So sorry guys."
13:38;13:40;"That's what you're hearing."
13:40;13:41;"And he's wearing a polo shirt?"
13:41;13:42;"Super preppy."
13:42;13:43;"Yeah."
13:43;13:44;"Dirt bike prep."
13:44;13:46;"I don't feel like going out and tangling with this guy."
13:46;13:48;"He doesn't look like the most chill dude ever."
13:48;13:49;"So I'm just going to--"
13:49;13:50;"Okay."
13:50;13:52;"We're just going to have to roll with that on this episode."
13:52;13:55;"Hey, buddy, I'm recording on that radio show in there."
13:55;13:56;"My bad."
13:56;13:57;"We're talking to DMB."
13:57;14:00;"Dave's calling in later."
14:00;14:02;"Hey, man, we've got [expletive] Dave Matthews calling in."
14:02;14:03;"No [expletive] man."
14:03;14:04;"Oh, I'm sorry."
14:04;14:06;"I'll do some wheelies somewhere else."
14:06;14:09;"Oh, my bad, man."
14:09;14:11;"I don't know what this dude is doing."
14:11;14:12;"This is so funny."
14:12;14:14;"He's got Dave coming through."
14:14;14:16;"A bright yellow dirt bike."
14:16;14:20;"And he's just doing like wheelies and like circling the parking lot."
14:20;14:25;"Here comes the dirt bike."
14:25;14:29;"Beware of the dirt bike."
14:29;14:36;"Because I hear they're coming to our town."
14:36;14:40;"They got plans for everyone."
14:40;14:45;"And now I hear they're over their sophomore chains."
14:45;14:49;"So you had better check it out."
14:49;14:58;"All right, so Nick, you're selling extremely rare Calvin and Hobbes bootlegs."
14:58;14:59;"Real grail."
14:59;15:01;"At the DMB lot."
15:01;15:03;"So you're having the time of your life, I imagine."
15:03;15:05;"You're 16 years old."
15:05;15:08;"Merriweather Post Pavilion parking lot."
15:08;15:09;"So fun."
15:09;15:12;"And so, again, it felt very chill."
15:12;15:16;"And most of the time that they were playing, it was these outdoor amphitheaters."
15:16;15:21;"I mean, I just remember going to the Fish Show at like what was the Cap Center, I think, you know?"
15:21;15:25;"The old, where the hockey team, the Capitals, would play."
15:25;15:29;"And it was -- I just remember that vibe being pretty harsh."
15:29;15:31;"And everything at --"
15:31;15:32;"That's really funny to me."
15:32;15:37;"I mean, obviously there's a lightness in the music of both acts."
15:37;15:44;"Although I guess like a deeper Fish Jam could get into some weird dissonant stuff that I don't think like a Dave Jam goes to."
15:44;15:51;"But just the idea of just being like that you're going to a Fish Show and it was like almost like you're going to see Cannibal Corpse or something."
15:51;15:54;"Just like, yikes, I'm not ready for this, man."
15:54;16:00;"I also just feel like there was a contingent of people, maybe because Fish had been around for so long, and it was the same thing with the Dead."
16:00;16:05;"There was a group of people that were going there to get f***** up."
16:05;16:10;"And I just don't remember that being the scene at those early DMV shows."
16:10;16:15;"And it's not my age because I think that I could feel it at the different shows."
16:15;16:23;"But I remember going to that Dead show and then to the Fish shows and just being like, I'm definitely around some people that are -- they're here to just go nuts."
16:23;16:30;"I could see that almost like a frightening Lynchian Wook character."
16:30;16:34;"The most burned out white dude with dreads."
16:34;16:36;"He's just taken psychedelics too many times."
16:36;16:41;"He's been possessed by DMT entities, not DMV."
16:41;16:43;"He should have been possessed by DMV entities."
16:43;16:44;"Totally."
16:44;16:47;"But yeah, I could see this kind of like haunted, scary --"
16:47;16:49;"Deep thousand yard stare."
16:49;16:51;"Yeah, thousand yard stare, dude."
16:51;16:54;"And maybe eventually that guy ended up going to DMV shows."
16:54;16:56;"He just hadn't heard about it yet in '95."
16:56;16:58;"So Jerry -- or '96."
16:58;17:01;"And Jerry's dead in August '95."
17:01;17:03;"And then he's going to Fish shows."
17:03;17:07;"And that is not the energy of Fish's music, I would say."
17:07;17:15;"It's certainly not like -- if you look at Trey as a front man, seems like a smart, chill -- like not -- he has similar energy to Dave Matthews."
17:15;17:24;"But I could see that spooky dude popping up at the Cap Center and you're 16 and just like that guy gives you the willies."
17:24;17:25;"He wasn't at the Dave show yet."
17:25;17:33;"And that's what -- if I think -- and I hadn't thought about it in so long, but there seemed -- that they were a new band, no matter how big they seemed, it just felt younger."
17:33;17:37;"You know, it was high school and college kids."
17:37;17:41;"And so even in the lot, it just felt -- yeah, it was a party."
17:41;17:46;"I mean, I definitely felt going to those shows was just so much fun."
17:46;17:50;"And I don't know if I have had that kind of fun at a show really since."
17:50;17:52;"Because like I said, they're almost all outdoors."
17:52;17:56;"You know, and that amphitheater vibe, so you're like laid out in the grass, like --"
17:56;17:57;"Yeah."
17:57;18:01;"You know, drinking some, like, I don't know, like flask somebody had snuck in."
18:01;18:04;"Or, you know, smoking weed when it was a lot harder to get."
18:04;18:10;"I just -- there was -- yeah, it was just -- had a really great, kind vibe."
18:10;18:17;"And the music totally matches it, because I first heard Dave Matthews on the radio probably, because I'm a bit younger than you."
18:17;18:21;"So the first time I heard about it, I heard it on the radio."
18:21;18:24;"Kids at my school would be talking about it, kids in middle school."
18:24;18:31;"I was saying the first time I heard about it was in fourth grade, because I remember a girl, Carly, came to school with a DMV patch on her back."
18:31;18:34;"So clearly she'd gotten into it through her older siblings."
18:34;18:36;"And me being kind of like, what is this?"
18:36;18:42;"And then when I heard, like, Satellite on the radio, also just the music -- I've said this before."
18:42;18:48;"Like, with Fish and the Grateful Dead, when I was a kid, I couldn't -- it took me a while to, like, figure out -- oh, wait."
18:48;18:52;"Like, for the dead, for instance, all these, like, skulls and roses."
18:52;18:56;"And then, you know, I hear, like, basically country music."
18:56;18:59;"I couldn't understand that at first when I was, like, really young."
18:59;19:01;"I had to, like, square that."
19:01;19:03;"I was expecting to hear, like --"
19:03;19:05;"Iron Maiden."
19:05;19:06;"Iron Maiden, basically."
19:06;19:08;"Or at least Pink Floyd."
19:08;19:11;"You know, I didn't know what I was looking for, but I was like, wait, what?"
19:11;19:15;"And then as I, you know, grew up, I could understand how all that stuff fit together."
19:15;19:19;"And even Fish, I was like, oh, Fish is, like, weird, psychedelic."
19:19;19:22;"And then I hear, like, kind of funk, like, funk Fish."
19:22;19:23;"And I was like, wait, what?"
19:23;19:26;"I couldn't totally understand it at first, not until I was older."
19:26;19:30;"But with Dave Matthews, I might have been the perfect age where I had this vision."
19:30;19:34;"I'd never been to a show, but what you're describing, Nick, a bunch of kind of, like,"
19:34;19:38;"East Coast young people smoking some weed, laying out."
19:38;19:39;"And then I'd hear Satellite on the radio."
19:39;19:41;"[Imitates Satellite]"
19:41;19:43;"And it actually sounded like that."
19:43;19:45;"I didn't have to, like, figure it out."
19:45;19:50;"That music really did have a lightness and kind of, like, a sophistication."
19:50;19:53;"This f---ing guy."
19:53;19:57;"What is this guy doing?"
19:57;20:00;"And it's a small parking lot outside your spot."
20:00;20:07;"Yeah, I mean, there's, like, five or six other, like, kind of industrial units that I'm in."
20:07;20:09;"It's a decent lot."
20:09;20:12;"So is he doing donut or is he just revving?"
20:12;20:14;"He's literally, like, 20 feet from me."
20:14;20:17;"He's on the other side of, like, my glass door."
20:17;20:19;"And I just see him going back and forth."
20:19;20:20;"What's he dressed like?"
20:20;20:21;"Does he kind of got, like, a dirtbag look?"
20:21;20:23;"You were joking when you said he was preppy."
20:23;20:24;"Or is he actually preppy?"
20:24;20:31;"Black hoodie, black do-rag, like, cargo shorts."
20:31;20:34;"Bright yellow dirt bike."
20:34;20:35;"Okay."
20:35;20:37;"Probably, like, 27 years old."
20:37;20:39;"And he's practicing moves."
20:39;20:40;"I don't know what the hell he's doing."
20:40;20:41;"He's just going."
20:41;20:44;"Yes, sometimes I'll look and I'll see he'll be up."
20:44;20:47;"Like, the front wheel will be fully in the air, like, three or four feet."
20:47;20:48;"He's practicing."
20:48;20:50;"He's practicing."
20:50;20:53;"The lot's probably pretty much empty except for my minivan."
20:53;20:55;"That's the lot scene."
20:55;20:59;"That's the lot scene right now at my studio where I work."
20:59;21:01;"This guy, ""Oh, look at this empty lot."
21:01;21:03;"I'm just going to rage on my dirt bike."""
21:03;21:04;"I mean, isn't that what you do?"
21:04;21:07;"It's like you take your kid to learn how to drive in an empty parking lot?"
21:07;21:08;"Yeah."
21:08;21:09;"I respect it."
21:09;21:12;"Hopefully, he's done by the time Dave gets on the phone."
21:12;21:13;"Yeah."
21:13;21:16;"If Dave's just like, ""What's that sound, man?"""
21:16;21:18;"Now he's doing full wheelie."
21:18;21:20;"Damn."
21:20;21:22;"I was just thinking you might like this image."
21:22;21:27;"The other way that I would listen to it is right before I, as you guys know,"
21:27;21:29;"worked for the Pentagon."
21:29;21:30;"I had worked for the--"
21:30;21:32;"That's a cool period of your life, dude."
21:32;21:37;"GMB head, working for the Pentagon, having lunch with Monica Lewinsky."
21:37;21:40;"But right before it, like, so when I was sort of peak,"
21:40;21:44;"I really think that '95-- it must have been '95, '96,"
21:44;21:47;"before I worked for the Pentagon, which I never sort of exactly"
21:47;21:50;"maybe explained how I got that job, but I worked for the Senate."
21:50;21:54;"And I would go after school-- or it was a summer internship that turned"
21:54;21:58;"into a full-time job, and I would take the subway downtown"
21:58;22:02;"or the bus to Capitol Hill, and I would just have my Discman on,"
22:02;22:06;"and I'd walk in, I'd be listening to DMB on my Discman"
22:06;22:08;"while writing letters."
22:08;22:13;"My job would be that I would write letters to constituents of Bill Cohen,"
22:13;22:15;"who was the senator from Maine."
22:15;22:18;"And his constituents would write him letters asking for anything."
22:18;22:23;"And one of my jobs was to write the letters back and sign his name,"
22:23;22:26;"which is-- I don't know if people understand that's really what happens."
22:26;22:28;"Like, your representatives don't write you back."
22:28;22:31;"Some dipshit intern is writing the letter, signing his name--"
22:31;22:35;"Somebody in mid-'90s Maine got a letter from Bill Cohen."
22:35;22:41;"It's like, ""So sorry to hear about the tragic loss of life"
22:41;22:43;"in your community."
22:43;22:48;"All I can say is if I was you, I would throw on"
22:48;22:51;"""Under the Table and Dreaming"" by Dave Matthews Band,"
22:51;22:54;"""Smoke a Fatty,"" and just [bleep] chill because there's nothing"
22:54;22:55;"you can do about it anyway."
22:55;22:57;"Hit me up if you're ever in D.C."
22:57;22:58;"Cordially yours."
22:59;23:01;"Senator William Cohen."
23:01;23:03;"They're just like, ""Weird letter, man."""

24:00;24:02;"they would have his signature, and then in the bottom,"
24:02;24:05;"it would say NW because it means ""I wrote it."""
24:05;24:06;"Really?"
24:06;24:09;"So the intern or whoever wrote the letter has to sign,"
24:09;24:11;"but somewhere sort of hidden at the bottom"
24:11;24:14;"so you know it wasn't really written by Bill Cullen."
24:14;24:17;"So you're free to come up with your own responses?"
24:17;24:18;"Yeah."
24:18;24:20;"Did you have someone overlooking that?"
24:20;24:21;"No one, I think, overlooked it."
24:21;24:23;"I mean, at this point, you're getting so much mail."
24:23;24:26;"So you're like a 17-year-old just like..."
24:26;24:29;"You're a senator entrusting a random 17-year-old"
24:29;24:32;"that you've met once to, like, draft responses"
24:32;24:33;"to your constituents?"
24:33;24:34;"That's crazy."
24:34;24:37;"Yeah, I mean, that's D.C."
24:37;24:38;"D.C. politics."
24:38;24:40;"Jake, do you think these senators know anything, man?"
24:40;24:41;"Man, if I was a senator,"
24:41;24:43;"I wouldn't have some random high school kid"
24:43;24:45;"writing back to my constituents."
24:45;24:46;"Yeah, that's what you think."
24:46;24:47;"That's what you think, man."
24:47;24:50;"And then after a few years down in the swamp,"
24:50;24:51;"you don't know--"
24:51;24:52;"You're jaded."
24:52;24:54;"Listen, yeah, you're getting your marching orders"
24:54;24:56;"from the big corporations."
24:56;24:58;"You got a lunch date at the Palm."
24:58;25:01;"Boeing and Raytheon are writing your legislation,"
25:01;25:04;"and then you got a teenage DMV fan"
25:04;25:06;"writing your letters to constituents,"
25:06;25:08;"and you're just hanging out in the middle, yeah,"
25:08;25:11;"eating lunch and trying to make smart investments"
25:11;25:12;"with insider information."
25:12;25:14;"That's what it means to be a senator."
25:14;25:15;"Sorry to burst your bubble."
25:15;25:16;"That's how America runs."
25:16;25:19;"I just-- I have this memory of writing one of these letters"
25:19;25:22;"and just listening on my headphones to, you know,"
25:22;25:24;"""Lift your skirt up and show the world to me."""
25:24;25:26;"I just remember that line, hearing that, like,"
25:26;25:28;"for one of the first-- really for the first time"
25:28;25:32;"while having my, like, Discman going and writing a letter."
25:32;25:33;"Beautiful song."
25:33;25:36;"Yeah, writing a letter to somebody who I think's,"
25:36;25:40;"you know, daughter had won some kind of"
25:40;25:43;"honorary high school thing"

25:45;25:46;"we're so proud of you."""
25:46;25:48;"But would you get in, like, letters--"

26:12;26:13;"and I don't remember one of--"
26:13;26:14;"maybe they separated them?"
26:14;26:17;"I mean, we're looking at years ago where they would go."
26:17;26:19;"These are mostly, like, people just looking for, like,"
26:19;26:21;"a little bit of recognition or, ""Hey, Senator,"
26:21;26:26;"just wanted to share with you that I just opened up"
26:26;26:28;"a pizzeria in Camden, Maine,"

26:49;26:50;"Senator William Cohen."
26:50;26:51;"You know, totally,"
26:51;26:54;"'cause I know that enough of those letters I wrote,"
26:54;26:59;"I had a feeling would be framed in someone's house"
26:59;27:01;"or someone's small business, like you're suggesting,"
27:01;27:04;"and thinking, ""Damn, they definitely are not looking"
27:04;27:05;"at that NW at the bottom."""
27:05;27:08;"You're channeling the spirit of the senator."
27:08;27:09;"Yes."
27:09;27:12;"It's not that you were writing his letters for him."
27:12;27:15;"You were more of a medium channeling his spirit."
27:15;27:16;"Yes."
27:16;27:17;"Nothing wrong with that."
27:17;27:18;"Mm-mm."
27:18;27:19;"It's mystical."
27:19;27:22;"Man, I would--as you describe it,"
27:22;27:24;"I was just a little bit too young,"
27:24;27:27;"but going to DMB's show, '95-'96,"
27:27;27:29;"Meriwether Post Pavilion,"
27:29;27:30;"that sounds amazing."
27:30;27:31;"It's interesting."
27:31;27:34;"I cannot think of another--"
27:34;27:37;"really another group or another scene"

27:41;27:42;"like we discussed."
27:42;27:44;"I think DMB probably played at them."
27:44;27:47;"I just can't think of another touring act"
27:47;27:50;"that had that vibe."
27:50;27:51;"I mean, it was so--"
27:51;27:52;"I don't think about it often,"
27:52;27:55;"but obviously have this week for this show,"
27:55;27:57;"and it was so positive."
27:57;28:00;"It's such a unique vibe and nothing--"
28:00;28:02;"there's something as to me,"
28:02;28:04;"and I'm excited that we have him on"
28:04;28:06;"because one of my biggest questions,"
28:06;28:08;"I'm sure he's answered many times"
28:08;28:09;"in many different ways,"
28:09;28:11;"but I've always been so curious about, like,"
28:11;28:14;"exactly where does this music come from?"
28:14;28:16;"'Cause people can sometimes be like,"
28:16;28:17;"""Hey, they're jam-banned."""
28:17;28:18;"Yeah, kind of."
28:18;28:21;"They jam a bit and rip in some solos."
28:21;28:22;"To me, the music is--"
28:22;28:23;"I've always felt like it was"
28:23;28:25;"very kind of unprecedented."
28:25;28:27;"You know, we talk about this stuff all the time."
28:27;28:29;"Like, all we do is talk about bands"
28:29;28:31;"and who influenced who"
28:31;28:33;"and what do you think they were listening to?"
28:33;28:35;"There is something about Dave Matthews."
28:35;28:37;"When you really look under the hood,"
28:37;28:40;"all the obvious answers come up short."
28:40;28:42;"You could say, like, ""Oh, Dave Matthews,"
28:42;28:46;"""they work this kind of big, prominent '90s jam band."""
28:46;28:48;"So, you know, The Grateful Dead."
28:48;28:50;"Eh, kind of."
28:50;28:52;"I don't hear a lot of dead in their music,"
28:52;28:53;"I have to say."
28:53;28:54;"Yeah, in fact, I looked it up."
28:54;28:56;"They've covered the dead twice."
28:56;28:59;"The week after Jerry died in '95,"
28:59;29:01;"they busted out In Eyes of the World."
29:01;29:02;"Nice."
29:02;29:06;"With some pretty tasteful violin and sax solos."
29:06;29:09;"And then maybe, like, 20 years later,"
29:09;29:11;"they did A Friend of the Devil."
29:11;29:12;"That's about it."
29:12;29:14;"So, actually, of course, we're going to have to ask Dave"
29:14;29:16;"about his relationship to the music of the dead."
29:16;29:19;"And I will say that when I've heard"
29:19;29:21;"those dead tours from, like, '90-'91"
29:21;29:24;"with Branford Marsalis on sax,"
29:24;29:26;"that brings a little bit of Dave"
29:26;29:27;"because of the instrumentation."
29:27;29:30;"But, again, there's not some obvious thing."
29:30;29:33;"You know what I thought of was, like,"
29:33;29:36;"late '70s, early '80s Joanie."
29:36;29:39;"Something about the guitar movement."
29:39;29:42;"And she would have, like, big ensembles on stage"
29:42;29:45;"with, like, flutes and, like, horn."
29:45;29:46;"Like, I'm not even--"
29:46;29:48;"I'm not, like, an expert in that era."
29:48;29:51;"And she got real into, like, basically,"
29:51;29:54;"kind of mathy, kind of jazz rock."
29:54;29:55;"Mathy, jazzy, yeah."
29:55;29:58;"Obviously, she played with Jocko Pastoreus."
29:58;30:00;"And, like, yeah, I mean,"
30:00;30:04;"I thought of that as one sort of pillar, maybe."
30:04;30:07;"But I don't, like, listen to Dave Matthews"
30:07;30:08;"and I'm like, ""Oh, yeah, he loves Joanie."""
30:08;30:10;"It's only after, like, after thinking about it."
30:10;30:12;"They're one of those very unique bands"
30:12;30:15;"where they truly have their own flavor."
30:15;30:18;"And nothing before is an obvious precedent."
30:18;30:20;"And I'd also say, you know, there's, of course,"
30:20;30:21;"they influenced a lot of people."
30:21;30:24;"But it's also, like, too hard to copy or something."
30:24;30:25;"Oh, yeah."
30:25;30:28;"Like, people might draw in, you know,"
30:28;30:30;"Ben Harper or Jack Johnson"
30:30;30:35;"because they represent a similar type of lifestyle"
30:35;30:36;"to some people,"
30:36;30:40;"which is, like, kind of laid back, beachy."
30:40;30:42;"You know, there used to be an SNL sketch"
30:42;30:43;"where Jack Johnson would host a show."
30:43;30:44;"I actually never seen this before."
30:44;30:47;"Rashida showed this to me for the first time three days ago."
30:47;30:49;"Andy Samberg played Jack Johnson."
30:49;30:50;"How did I miss this era"
30:50;30:53;"where Andy Samberg would play Jack Johnson on SNL?"
30:53;30:54;"I missed this, too."
30:54;30:56;"And you'd have a show where it's all about"
30:56;30:58;"how he doesn't wear shoes."
30:58;31:00;"And he has, like, a talk show."
31:00;31:03;"And he's like, ""Welcome, my next guest, Dave Matthews."""
31:03;31:05;"And somebody comes out and plays Dave Matthews."
31:05;31:07;"And then the real Dave Matthews comes out"
31:07;31:08;"and plays Ozzy Osbourne."
31:08;31:10;"But anyway, they're clearly on that."
31:10;31:11;"They're making a joke of, like,"
31:11;31:13;"""Yeah, I'm a laid-back guy like Jack Johnson."
31:13;31:14;"He's a surfer."""
31:14;31:15;"And they're like, ""Dave Matthews,"
31:15;31:17;"it sits comfortably next to it."""
31:17;31:19;"I understand with the listeners and stuff,"
31:19;31:21;"but the music doesn't sound that much like it."
31:21;31:26;"There really is something hyper unique about his music."

32:15;32:18;"Well, I was reading just like on the Wikipedia"
32:18;32:20;"and then kind of maybe off some links from that,"
32:20;32:22;"but like, and they didn't even really want to call it"
32:22;32:24;"the Dave Matthews Band."
32:24;32:27;"There was like an early show where the booker"
32:27;32:30;"or the sound guy or whatever just like wrote that down"
32:30;32:32;"on the like marquee or whatever,"
32:32;32:35;"or just like the backstage little run of the show"
32:35;32:38;"for the night, just wrote Dave Matthews Band."
32:38;32:39;"They were like, well, I guess we could use it,"
32:39;32:41;"because they were playing around with like made up words,"
32:41;32:42;"you know?"
32:42;32:44;"And basically it was like, yeah,"
32:44;32:46;"he had written these songs on an acoustic guitar,"
32:46;32:49;"but then he wasn't like telling what the other guys"
32:49;32:50;"what to play."
32:50;32:52;"- So it really is a band in that sense of like-"
32:52;32:54;"- And he wasn't even like, oh, I want like,"
32:54;32:56;"I definitely want a sax player."
32:56;32:59;"Like he was just like, I met this guy at the bar"
32:59;33:02;"that I worked at and he was such a badass"
33:02;33:03;"and I loved his playing."
33:03;33:04;"So I was just like, okay, that's the vibe."
33:04;33:06;"He's in the band."
33:06;33:09;"And he can rip and do what he wants to do."
33:09;33:10;"- It just came together."
33:10;33:13;"- Yeah, that kind of worked."
33:13;33:14;"Although I was reading,"
33:14;33:16;"and maybe we can ask him about this,"
33:16;33:19;"that their first practice was so hilariously terrible"
33:19;33:21;"that he was like, I'm almost surprised"
33:21;33:24;"that we got back together and did a second practice."
33:24;33:25;"And I'm kind of like curious,"
33:25;33:28;"I'm like, what did that first practice sound like?"
33:28;33:31;"And is there a tape, right?"
33:31;33:33;"- And would you release it?"
33:33;33:36;"- So before we talk to Dave Matthews,"
33:36;33:39;"we'll give you five to seven minutes"
33:39;33:41;"about a different Dave."
33:41;33:45;"If there's any just goofball out there"
33:45;33:47;"who doesn't want to talk to one of the preeminent"
33:47;33:49;"musicians of our times."
33:49;33:52;"Well, here's, how about this Dave?"
33:52;33:54;"Dave's killer bread."
33:54;33:57;"'Cause I don't know why Dave popped into my head recently."
33:57;33:59;"I think I was thinking about,"
33:59;34:02;"I got a box of Lara bars recently."
34:02;34:03;"You guys into Lara bars?"
34:03;34:04;"- No."
34:04;34:05;"- Are you anti?"
34:05;34:08;"- Yeah, I've had them, they're nasty."
34:08;34:10;"(laughing)"
34:10;34:11;"- What about you, Nick?"
34:11;34:13;"- Oh, this is interesting."
34:13;34:17;"I really don't think that I've had one."
34:17;34:18;"- Okay, I'll get you some."
34:18;34:20;"But Lara bars, they're very,"
34:20;34:22;"they're kind of mushed together."
34:22;34:24;"They're very crunchy in the sense that"
34:24;34:26;"there's like four ingredients per."
34:26;34:28;"So like, you'll get one that's,"
34:28;34:30;"it's just like dates, almonds,"
34:30;34:32;"blended together with like cherries"
34:32;34:34;"or chocolate chips or peanut butter."
34:34;34:36;"I find that they're very controversial."
34:36;34:39;"I might be a Lara bar super fan actually."
34:39;34:41;"- But why are they controversial?"
34:41;34:43;"I mean, honestly, even the consistency,"
34:43;34:44;"maybe I've opened one,"
34:44;34:47;"it strikes me almost as a Luna bar."
34:47;34:48;"- No, no, it's not like a Luna bar."
34:48;34:50;"It's mushier than a Luna bar."
34:50;34:52;"And people, I've just found that like people in my life,"
34:52;34:54;"- It's too mushy."
34:54;34:56;"- I have referred to them."
34:56;34:57;"I'm not going to name names,"
34:57;34:58;"but there's people I know,"
34:58;34:59;"I'm like, you like Lara bars?"
34:59;35:01;"And I've heard at least two people say,"
35:01;35:03;"those, I hate that they taste like vomit."
35:03;35:05;"And there's some people really don't like them,"
35:05;35:06;"but I've always loved them."
35:06;35:08;"I'm a Lara bar super fan."
35:08;35:11;"And I think I'd bought a box of Lara bars recently."
35:11;35:13;"And so I was thinking about Lara bars again"
35:13;35:15;"after for the first time in a while."
35:15;35:17;"And I was thinking about, wow, you know what?"
35:17;35:20;"I really like these a lot more than most people."
35:20;35:21;"You know, Jake, your reaction,"
35:21;35:22;"I get that all the time."
35:22;35:24;"And anyway, so I was researching,"
35:24;35:25;"what is the story with Lara bars?"
35:25;35:26;"You know, what is Lara?"
35:26;35:28;"Is it like an acronym or something?"
35:28;35:31;"No, there's a woman named Lara and she started it."
35:31;35:32;"And then I was thinking about,"
35:32;35:34;"oh, I don't know why this popped in my head."
35:34;35:37;"I said, I wonder if she knows Cliff from Cliff bar."
35:37;35:38;"And then I thought,"
35:38;35:40;"who knows, maybe they're married or something."
35:40;35:42;"That'd be, that'd be a kind of a cute power couple."
35:42;35:44;"If Lara and Cliff were together,"
35:44;35:46;"I don't think they are, but I don't know."
35:46;35:47;"For some reason, I started thinking"
35:47;35:51;"about all these people who live in the kind of crunchy world"
35:51;35:53;"and who are like major characters."
35:53;35:54;"Maybe one day we could even do it,"
35:54;35:57;"a Wreck-It Ralph style movie instead of,"
35:57;35:58;"but instead of video game characters,"
35:58;36:01;"we get Lara and Cliff and one of the next people."
36:01;36:03;"And Power from Power Bars."
36:03;36:07;"And Power, actually 50 Cent made a show about him."
36:07;36:11;"It's called Power, about the origin of Power Bars."
36:11;36:12;"So then I started thinking"
36:12;36:14;"about another kind of crunchy character."
36:14;36:17;"And I started thinking, wait, what's that bread"
36:17;36:18;"that has that like Jack dude"
36:18;36:20;"with a ponytail playing guitar on it?"
36:20;36:22;"'Cause I've just always seen that around."
36:22;36:24;"And so I was like, wait, what is that called again?"
36:24;36:26;"And I was like, oh right, it's called Dave's Killer Bread."
36:26;36:28;"And then I started to think again, is this a real dude?"
36:28;36:31;"'Cause as we well know on Time Crisis,"
36:31;36:32;"sometimes it's not a real person."
36:32;36:34;"Einstein Brothers, totally made up."
36:34;36:36;"We got that legendary email where we learned"
36:36;36:40;"that the Einstein Brothers Bagel Company totally made up."
36:40;36:42;"But Lara is real and her bars are real."
36:42;36:44;"Cliff and his bars are real."
36:44;36:47;"And Dave who made Dave's Killer Bread is also real."
36:47;36:49;"And I didn't realize that he has this kind of like"
36:49;36:51;"wild backstory."
36:51;36:53;"He's an old school guy from Oregon."
36:53;36:56;"He's from a town called Milwaukee, Oregon."
36:56;36:58;"Confusing, I know, but you know it?"
36:58;37:00;"- Yeah, it's just a suburb of Portland."
37:00;37:01;"- Okay."
37:01;37:02;"- I've delivered pizza."
37:02;37:04;"It's really close to like Reed College and stuff."
37:04;37:05;"- Oh, I see."
37:05;37:07;"- I've definitely delivered some Johns down into Milwaukee."
37:07;37:10;"- So Dave's Killer Bread, he had a family bakery,"
37:10;37:12;"but Dave had like a very troubled life growing up"
37:12;37:13;"and he didn't want to have anything to do"
37:13;37:15;"with the family bakery."
37:15;37:18;"And he basically was in and out of jail,"
37:18;37:21;"starting like from his teen years for all sorts of stuff."
37:21;37:24;"In '87, he was jailed for the first time"
37:24;37:26;"after burglarizing a home."
37:26;37:28;"And then he got out of jail and rejoined the family bakery"
37:28;37:32;"in '89, but quit again and then moved to Massachusetts"
37:32;37:35;"where he served time again for armed robbery."
37:35;37:37;"And then, so, you know, really troubled life,"
37:37;37:41;"robbing houses, armed robbery, drugs."
37:41;37:46;"And basically as he was kind of rehabilitated in prison,"
37:46;37:49;"he decided he really wanted to rejoin the family business"
37:49;37:51;"and kind of rebuilt it."
37:51;37:54;"And he started Dave's Killer Bread."
37:54;37:56;"And then I'd never heard this story before,"
37:56;37:58;"and he's actually a really interesting guy."
37:58;38:00;"You can read a lot about him."
38:00;38:03;"He continued to have some trouble in his life."
38:03;38:06;"In 2013, he had a mental health crisis"
38:06;38:09;"where his friend called the police to tell him"
38:09;38:11;"that he was having kind of a breakdown."
38:11;38:13;"And then he fled in a black Cadillac Escalade"
38:13;38:16;"and rammed two police cars head on."
38:16;38:19;"So, you know, he's like wildlife's kind of been"
38:19;38:22;"all over the place, but he's built this very successful"
38:22;38:26;"bread company, and he's a proud second chance employer,"
38:26;38:29;"meaning that he'll hire who it's ever best for the job"
38:29;38:32;"regardless of criminal history, because based on his life story,"
38:32;38:34;"of course he believes in second chances."
38:34;38:36;"But anyway, I had no idea."
38:36;38:38;"And there's like a lot of profiles of him"
38:38;38:41;"in like kind of Oregon magazines and newspapers."
38:41;38:43;"He's got like a really intense look."
38:43;38:45;"He's actually a very photogenic guy."
38:45;38:47;"And then suddenly I'm reading about this,"
38:47;38:49;"and like, it's like, ""Whoa, this guy was in and out of jail."""
38:49;38:53;"So of course my first thought was, ""Did he kill somebody?"
38:53;38:57;"Is it called Dave's Killer Bread because he went to jail for murder?"""
38:57;38:59;"That's not the case."
38:59;39:02;"- That would be in poor taste. - That would be in poor taste."
39:02;39:05;"It is. He's done 15 years in prison for various things,"
39:05;39:07;"but not for murder."
39:07;39:10;"It's called Dave's Killer Bread just because it's like killer bread."
39:10;39:12;"It just tastes killer."
39:12;39:16;"And also he's into music, and he plays guitar,"
39:16;39:18;"and that's why he's playing guitar on the thing."
39:18;39:20;"But I was like, ""Whoa, what a fascinating dude."
39:20;39:22;"Maybe we should have him on the show sometime."""
39:22;39:24;"And it's good bread."
39:24;39:26;"I got a loaf in my fridge right now at the studio."
39:26;39:28;"So is that your go-to bread, Jake?"
39:28;39:30;"Yeah. If I'm getting groceries,"
39:30;39:34;"routinely when I'm working for the studio,"
39:34;39:38;"I'll make like a tuna or like a turkey sandwich for lunch."
39:38;39:40;"So I have a little mini fridge."
39:40;39:42;"I'll get the groceries from Sprouts or whatever."
39:42;39:44;"Yeah. Dave's Killer. That's the go-to."
39:44;39:47;"They sold the brand. I guess he's still involved with it."
39:47;39:52;"But they sold the brand in 2015 for $275 million."
39:52;39:54;"- Wow. - Wait, what?"
39:54;39:56;"I don't know all the economics of it,"
39:56;39:58;"but just picture you're this dude, Dave doll."
39:58;40:00;"- Doll, like rolled doll. - What?"
40:00;40:03;"This sounds like an HBO prestige drama."
40:03;40:05;"I guess it kind of sounds like ""The Bear"" too."
40:05;40:07;"Troubled dude in and out of prison,"
40:07;40:10;"mixed feelings about his relationship with the family business."
40:10;40:14;"Then he finally comes back, takes over the family bakery."
40:14;40:18;"Turns out he's actually like really good at it."
40:18;40:22;"This dude sold the company for $275 million."
40:22;40:28;"And supposedly Dave personally received $33 million in 2015."
40:28;40:29;"Oh, that's where you're sitting."
40:29;40:31;"Okay. I was like, ""Where are you getting this $275 million?"""
40:31;40:32;"- Okay. - No, no. He didn't."
40:32;40:34;"Yeah, he's not sitting on $275 million."
40:34;40:35;"I'm sure he had investments."
40:35;40:40;"It is currently the largest organic bread company in North America."
40:40;40:41;"- I think we should call-- - That's amazing."
40:41;40:43;"We should call our other Dave right now"
40:43;40:46;"and ask him what he thinks of Dave's Killer Bread."
40:46;40:48;"Okay, that's a good opener."
40:48;40:49;"It's a good icebreaker."
40:49;40:51;"I'm with you here on TC."
40:51;40:55;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
40:55;40:58;"[phone ringing]"
40:58;41:00;"Hey, young people."
41:00;41:02;"[laughter]"
41:02;41:04;"Hello, young people."
41:04;41:06;"- Young people? - Hello, Dave."
41:06;41:08;"- Young? - We're not that young."
41:08;41:10;"I just believe you all look good."
41:10;41:13;"- You've been taking care of yourselves. - Oh, thanks."
41:13;41:16;"That's right. I'm moisturizing."
41:16;41:17;"This is already going great."
41:17;41:20;"I thought if I started with compliments,"
41:20;41:23;"then maybe it'd be a get off to a good start."
41:23;41:25;"That's funny because we were just nervously thinking"
41:25;41:28;"how to start having a legend like you on the show."
41:28;41:30;"We came up--"
41:30;41:33;"We're very thrilled to have you on the show."
41:33;41:34;"Thanks so much."
41:34;41:35;"But we're going to get right into it"
41:35;41:38;"because what do you know about Dave's Killer Bread?"
41:38;41:39;"Are you familiar with the brand?"
41:39;41:40;"One Dave to another."
41:40;41:41;"I do know that bread."
41:41;41:42;"I'm not responsible for it,"
41:42;41:45;"but this is what's good about it."
41:45;41:46;"Am I too loud?"
41:46;41:48;"- No, it's great. - Perfect."
41:48;41:50;"It's nice to meet everybody."
41:50;41:52;"Ezra, I assume that's you"
41:52;41:54;"because of the size of your microphone."
41:54;41:56;"- And also, I've seen you before. - That's right."
41:56;41:58;"That's a serious [bleep] microphone."
41:58;41:59;"And then mine isn't as serious,"
41:59;42:01;"but that's because I'm always pretending"
42:01;42:04;"to be more humble than I actually am."
42:04;42:05;"That's not true. I just made that up."
42:05;42:08;"I am actually as humble as I am."
42:08;42:10;"And then also, and I'm very chatty"
42:10;42:12;"because I had coffee because I'm tired."
42:12;42:13;"So I apologize."
42:13;42:14;"But that's what we're doing,"
42:14;42:16;"so I'll try and be inclusive."
42:16;42:20;"- No, we're talking. - And then Jake."
42:20;42:22;"Yep, right here. Nice to meet you, sir."
42:22;42:23;"Nice to meet you, Jake."
42:23;42:25;"I'm glad we have a similar hairstyle,"
42:25;42:26;"although I have less hair."
42:26;42:28;"You mean receding?"
42:28;42:31;"Yes, well, mine is definitely on the retreat,"
42:31;42:33;"but it's been on the retreat for a long time,"
42:33;42:35;"and I feel good about it."
42:35;42:36;"You're holding steady, man."
42:36;42:38;"Who knows? Who knows? Maybe I'm wrong."
42:38;42:39;"But I don't want to have--"
42:39;42:41;"I don't want to get any new hair."
42:41;42:43;"I had a hair stylist."
42:43;42:44;"I guess I could call him that."
42:44;42:46;"My sister introduced me to him."
42:46;42:47;"He was a nice guy until one time"
42:47;42:48;"he cut my hair way too short"
42:48;42:50;"because he was talking about something"
42:50;42:52;"that was more interesting than my hair,"
42:52;42:53;"and he got distracted."
42:53;42:56;"He told me about all these different new techniques"
42:56;42:58;"of taking hair from the back"
42:58;43:00;"and putting it in the front."
43:00;43:01;"It's kind of magical."
43:01;43:04;"But the problem is it just seems like a lot of work."
43:04;43:05;"Apparently, they're really good."
43:05;43:07;"They are. I think they really--"
43:07;43:08;"Now they don't fake anybody out."
43:08;43:10;"Wait, wait, but now that you're talking about it--"
43:10;43:12;"We're talking transplant?"
43:12;43:15;"Transplant, but it's like transplant,"
43:15;43:19;"like, from here to here,"
43:19;43:20;"and then they plant it."
43:20;43:21;"They plant it like a garden,"
43:21;43:23;"like you're moving roses."
43:23;43:24;"I guess that's the traditional."
43:24;43:25;"But this is one machine."
43:25;43:26;"It's like a helmet."
43:26;43:27;"Have you heard of this, Ezra?"
43:27;43:29;"I've heard that they've gotten really good at it."
43:29;43:32;"Somebody explained to me that in the '80s,"
43:32;43:33;"there was no art to it."
43:33;43:34;"No."
43:34;43:36;"People would get these really awkward hairlines,"
43:36;43:39;"but now with, like, robots, AI, whatever,"
43:39;43:41;"they can make it naturalistic."
43:41;43:42;"I don't think it's naturalistic."
43:42;43:45;"I think it's hair."
43:45;43:46;"No, no, no."
43:46;43:49;"I'm saying they can plant it as God intended."
43:49;43:50;"Like a garden."
43:50;43:51;"They can plant it--"
43:51;43:55;"They can plant it so it looks just as if God had intended it."
43:55;43:56;"Wait, so now that we're--"
43:56;43:58;"Wait, Dave, how long has your hair been receding?"
43:58;44:00;"As long as I can remember."
44:00;44:02;"Yeah, I've been familiar with you for, like, 30 years,"
44:02;44:05;"and I feel like from the get-go, you had the receding,"
44:05;44:07;"and it seems like it's been solid"
44:07;44:10;"at that same kind of battle line"
44:10;44:11;"right here"
44:11;44:12;"for about 30 years."
44:12;44:13;"Yeah."
44:13;44:15;"Anyway, it's admirable,"
44:15;44:18;"and now I would like Seinfeld 2000 to--"
44:18;44:21;"We regret to inform you Seinfeld 2000 is not on today."
44:21;44:23;"He has a day job."
44:23;44:25;"I didn't know how to recognize anybody,"
44:25;44:27;"so now I feel better,"
44:27;44:29;"'cause I didn't know if somebody went by--"
44:29;44:30;"Okay."
44:31;44:33;"No, and the last one here is Nick."
44:33;44:34;"Nick, hello. It's good to see you."
44:34;44:35;"Hey, it's a pleasure."
44:35;44:37;"But you look very familiar, though."
44:37;44:38;"You know--"
44:38;44:40;"Or is it just 'cause you look like a neighbor of mine"
44:40;44:41;"that used to be?"
44:41;44:43;"It's funny that you bring this up,"
44:43;44:45;"because do you remember Johnny Marth thought the same thing?"
44:45;44:46;"Oh, yeah."
44:46;44:47;"Maybe you just got one of those faces."
44:47;44:49;"I have a familiar face."
44:49;44:52;"I wish that we-- I wish we had a shared history."
44:52;44:55;"I'm such a fan, and I'm so happy you're on here."
44:55;45:00;"But no, I do think that we had another illustrious guest"
45:00;45:02;"on the show, and they-- right out of the gate,"
45:02;45:04;"he was like, ""Oh, hey, what's going on, man?"""
45:04;45:06;"I was like, ""I know you think you know me."""
45:06;45:07;"And I didn't."
45:07;45:08;"And you didn't."
45:08;45:09;"And he didn't."
45:09;45:10;"I just got one of those faces."
45:10;45:11;"I have a face like that."
45:11;45:13;"Okay, wait, but Dave, first of all,"
45:13;45:15;"I really appreciate you coming in,"
45:15;45:17;"slammed a cup of coffee for the show,"
45:17;45:18;"because that's what we want to do."
45:18;45:19;"We just want to talk."
45:19;45:22;"So did you have something to say about Dave's Killer Bread?"
45:22;45:23;"Oh, right."
45:23;45:24;"Oh, Jesus."
45:24;45:25;"That happened."
45:25;45:28;"Well, the good thing about Dave's Killer Bread"
45:28;45:34;"is that it's like a sandwich bread from the olden days."
45:34;45:35;"It's soft."
45:35;45:39;"It reminds me of, like, old-- like, Wonder Bread."
45:39;45:42;"Not as wonder as Wonder Bread, but it's, like, soft,"
45:42;45:44;"and it's, you know, it's not crusty."
45:44;45:45;"I don't feel like--"
45:45;45:46;"You love the texture."
45:46;45:51;"It's just, like, except apparently it's also organic"
45:51;45:55;"and not full of too many things that are supposed to make it last forever."
45:55;45:57;"But maybe it is full of those things."
45:57;45:59;"But it seems like they're trying to say"
45:59;46:02;"that it's relatively natural bread,"
46:02;46:03;"but it has nothing to do with me."
46:03;46:06;"I just find it's good for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,"
46:06;46:09;"which is a sandwich I make for my son fairly regularly,"
46:09;46:11;"unlike most other Americans"
46:11;46:13;"who wouldn't even think of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches."
46:13;46:18;"I make it for my son every morning when he's going to school"
46:18;46:22;"on the way to expand his mind in high school."
46:22;46:25;"So that is your go-to in the house is Dave's Killer Bread?"
46:25;46:27;"Just for the peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
46:27;46:28;"Just for the peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
46:28;46:32;"What's your theory on Americans not liking PB&Js?"
46:32;46:33;"I didn't always make that up."
46:33;46:36;"That was like the old roast beef or turkey or--"
46:36;46:38;"Yeah, I was trying to be controversial, really, as well."
46:38;46:40;"Well, you-- no, I could almost believe it if you--"
46:40;46:41;"You struck a nerve."
46:41;46:43;"Yeah, if you said that people--"
46:43;46:46;"that nobody does peanut butter and jelly sandwiches anymore,"
46:46;46:48;"I'm willing to believe that it's down."
46:48;46:51;"I mean, we've discussed on this show, nobody eats baked potatoes anymore."
46:51;46:53;"The potato's taking a harder hit than the PB&J."
46:53;46:55;"I think so."
46:55;46:57;"I think that's true."
46:57;47:00;"I think asparagus and all its relatives,"
47:00;47:04;"like cauliflower and broccoli,"
47:04;47:06;"took a big upswing."
47:06;47:11;"And then the potato's just somehow fallen by the wayside,"
47:11;47:14;"unlike the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I think, is doing fine."
47:14;47:15;"Yeah, I think it's-- I think you're right."
47:15;47:18;"In America, where it's a staple,"
47:18;47:22;"you probably all know that most other parts of the planet,"
47:22;47:24;"people don't eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
47:24;47:26;"USA."
47:26;47:27;"USA."

48:58;49:00;"which had been there for a long time."
49:00;49:04;"Well, as from England, like, they put vinegar and salt on it."

49:05;49:06;"which we don't do."
49:06;49:07;"But we call them french fries,"
49:07;49:09;"but they don't call them french fries."
49:09;49:12;"And then they make a potato chip that is the same flavor,"
49:12;49:13;"which has been around for a long time."
49:13;49:16;"But the ketchup-flavored potato chip"
49:16;49:19;"is something that's in South Africa that we don't have here."
49:19;49:21;"- So you were eating that as a young man"
49:21;49:23;"in the South Africa days. - Yeah, and also"
49:23;49:28;"there's a Malay rice dish called bubuati"
49:28;49:29;"that I like a lot."
49:29;49:30;"It's got lamb in it."

49:37;49:41;"across, I think that there's a dried meat"
49:41;49:42;"that they do there."

49:45;49:48;"which are probably less common than an American vegan."
49:48;49:52;"But a vegan South African would not like this."

50:06;50:08;"I feel like biltong is slowly--"
50:08;50:10;"now that everything is everywhere,"
50:10;50:11;"I feel like it's slowly made its way"
50:11;50:14;"into, like, the bourgeois markets of America"
50:14;50:15;"where they're like-- - It has."
50:15;50:16;"- Organic biltong, you know,"

50:26;50:27;"it's a little bit gross,"

52:57;52:58;"- It's the same part of the supermarket."
52:58;52:59;"Cliff Bars, I think it was, like,"
52:59;53:02;"a guy in Colorado started it in the '90s."
53:02;53:03;"It's always got a guy--"
53:03;53:05;"there's a drawing of somebody, like,"
53:05;53:06;"climbing a mountain on it."
53:06;53:08;"It's very outdoorsy. - I never looked at the drawing,"
53:08;53:09;"but it's cartoony, right?"
53:09;53:10;"- Yeah, cartoony, yes, exactly."
53:10;53:13;"- Cliff Bars are a lot more ubiquitous than Larabars."
53:13;53:16;"I feel like backstage, green room,"
53:16;53:19;"you're more likely to encounter a Cliff than a Lara."
53:19;53:20;"- I'm--I agree with you on that."
53:20;53:22;"I feel like I've seen more Cliff Bars"
53:22;53:25;"in the healthy section of a backstage area..."
53:25;53:28;"- Absolutely. - Than I--than a Larabar."
53:28;53:29;"Unless, of course, you ask for it,"
53:29;53:32;"in which case, of course, it would be backstage."
53:32;53:34;"- It sounds like you're not that into either."
53:34;53:37;"- For whatever reason, I think I'd be happy to have one,"
53:37;53:41;"but--of either, if that's what was going around."
53:41;53:44;"- I mean, who's psyched about, like--"
53:44;53:45;"who's psyched about an energy bar?"
53:45;53:47;"- I'm psyched about-- I'm psyched about Larabars."
53:47;53:49;"- Ezra is. - Dave, what's your--"
53:49;53:51;"let's stick on food for a second."
53:51;53:53;"- I think food is a perfectly reasonable--"
53:53;53:55;"it's a common-- it's common ground."
53:55;53:57;"- We do have a lot of questions about music."
53:57;53:59;"- Music, yeah. - But I'm sure you get asked"
53:59;54:01;"about that all the time, so do you ever--"
54:01;54:02;"- I'm really happy about food."
54:02;54:04;"- Have you ever invested in a restaurant"
54:04;54:06;"or an energy bar or anything like that?"
54:06;54:07;"- No, I-- - I'm sure you must have"
54:07;54:08;"people come all the time."
54:08;54:10;"You must constantly meet people, like,"
54:10;54:12;"your kids' school, it's like, they know"
54:12;54:14;"that you're a very successful musician,"
54:14;54:17;"and they'd be like, ""Hey, man, I got a killer idea"
54:17;54:19;"for some new kind of potato chips or something,"""
54:19;54:21;"or nobody ever came to you and be like,"
54:21;54:23;"""Hey, Dave, we're bringing biltong"
54:23;54:24;"to the American Midwest."""
54:24;54:26;"- No, actually, someone did come to me"
54:26;54:28;"about biltong one time. - Knew it."
54:28;54:30;"- Made some biltong. They said,"
54:30;54:31;"""We want to bring this."""
54:31;54:33;"I'm not gonna name anybody, 'cause I don't want"
54:33;54:34;"them to be upset."
54:34;54:37;"They were related to a famous South African golfer."
54:37;54:40;"This way, they'll know who they are"
54:40;54:41;"if they hear this show."
54:41;54:43;"I don't know what the likelihood of that is."
54:43;54:44;"But if they don't-- - It's low."
54:44;54:47;"- Also, I was--you know, more about them--"
54:47;54:50;"it says more about them than it says about anything else."
54:50;54:52;"But it was really [bleep] biltong."
54:52;54:54;"- It didn't taste good? - No, it didn't taste good."
54:54;54:56;"It was just--it was not quite--"
54:56;54:57;"you have--it can't not be right."
54:57;54:59;"- So you're telling me you don't have a piece"
54:59;55:02;"at all of the burgeoning American biltong market?"
55:02;55:03;"- I don't have a piece of that."
55:03;55:06;"I do have some biltong in my house."
55:06;55:08;"Which I'm really excited about."
55:08;55:11;"And every time I go past, I got a big slab."
55:11;55:15;"It's a big slab of dried meat."
55:15;55:17;"You could just knock somebody unconscious with it."
55:17;55:19;"It's such a giant, hard slab of meat."
55:19;55:21;"And then you--then you get a big butcher,"
55:21;55:23;"and you--and you hack a piece off."
55:23;55:25;"- Right. - And then it's kind of chewy,"
55:25;55:28;"and it's delightful, and it's not sweet like jerky."
55:28;55:30;"- Uh-huh. - I'm really happy about it."
55:30;55:33;"- Your entire financial portfolio is 0% biltong"
55:33;55:35;"outside of the 100%. - 0%."
55:35;55:37;"But I will--I will--I would say--"
55:37;55:39;"I'm interested in what food you've been invested in."
55:39;55:44;"I have recently--I'm considering, quietly considering,"
55:44;55:50;"somehow supporting sort of a pop-up soup joint"
55:50;55:54;"that--in the Northwest that is thinking of going--"
55:54;55:55;"you know, moving into a--"
55:55;55:58;"making--formalizing themselves as a restaurant."
55:58;56:00;"I'm thinking about it because I just want--"
56:00;56:02;"that's--I want that damn soup,"
56:02;56:03;"and I want it whenever I want it."
56:03;56:05;"And that's the problem. - Wait, so you're thinking--"
56:05;56:06;"- It's a pop-up. - You're familiar--"
56:06;56:09;"- So you're thinking of helping--moving--"
56:09;56:10;"when you talk about the investment,"
56:10;56:11;"it would be moving the truck"
56:11;56:13;"into a brick-and-mortar restaurant."
56:13;56:14;"- Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
56:14;56:16;"""Brick-and-mortar"" was the term I was looking for."
56:16;56:17;"- Right. - And the reason--"
56:17;56:18;"it's selfish."
56:18;56:19;"I don't want this thing to blow up,"
56:19;56:22;"and all of a sudden, there's one of these on every corner."
56:22;56:24;"I just want one on my corner."
56:24;56:25;"I don't have to wait until Saturdays"
56:25;56:27;"at the farmer's market. - Oh, yeah, all right."
56:27;56:29;"Oh, I see, I see. So that's like a small--"
56:29;56:31;"- And if it works out for-- - You're talking about"
56:31;56:34;"a small local operation in your--"
56:34;56:35;"you live in Seattle, right?"
56:35;56:37;"- Yeah, it's too good to fail,"
56:37;56:40;"which is a better thing than too big to fail"
56:40;56:41;"or too rich to fail."
56:41;56:43;"It's just--just so good."
56:43;56:45;"Everybody who has it says, ""This is the goodness."""
56:45;56:47;"This is the goodness. - Do you want to tell us the name?"
56:47;56:49;"- I can't. I can't remember. It's Two Brothers."
56:49;56:50;"- It's Two Brothers."
56:50;56:52;"- I just know that those guys are there,"
56:52;56:53;"and then they gave me their card,"
56:53;56:54;"and it's at the house."
56:54;56:55;"I don't know. - And is it any soup,"
56:55;56:57;"or do they have a specialty?"
56:57;56:59;"- No, it's sort of-- it's got-- it's related."
56:59;57:01;"It's related to, like, ramen,"
57:01;57:03;"but not the stuff you get out the packet."
57:03;57:04;"- Okay. - It's been a while"
57:04;57:08;"since Seattle launched a major multinational corporation,"
57:08;57:12;"so maybe it's time. - Maybe it's time."
57:12;57:14;"This is going to take over the Panera market."
57:14;57:15;"- This might be the early '90s."
57:15;57:16;"- On a recent episode,"
57:16;57:18;"we were talking about Duff McKagan,"
57:18;57:20;"who's another Seattle musician,"
57:20;57:23;"and somehow we uncovered that in the--"
57:23;57:25;"was it early or mid '90s,"
57:25;57:27;"he invested in Starbucks?"
57:27;57:29;"- Microsoft. - Amazon."
57:29;57:31;"- And maybe Microsoft?"
57:31;57:32;"- So he's just-- - It was like, interesting."
57:32;57:34;"- So you're saying that-- I mean,"
57:34;57:36;"so he doesn't have to--"
57:36;57:37;"he doesn't have to do a damn thing."
57:37;57:39;"- He put in, like, $100,000 into, like--"
57:39;57:41;"- Holy crap. - No, he--"
57:41;57:42;"- Starbucks and Amazon."
57:42;57:44;"- He just wanted to invest in local businesses."
57:44;57:46;"Local startup businesses, like your soup place."
57:46;57:48;"I mean-- - Lord, that dude"
57:48;57:51;"had chose wisely, didn't he? - Oh, yeah."
57:51;57:53;"- Duff is just-- we have no idea."
57:53;57:55;"His net worth is bananas, and we didn't--"
57:55;57:57;"nobody even talks about it."
57:57;57:59;"- I wonder, Duff might be more paid than Axel."
57:59;58:01;"- There's a good chance, maybe."
58:01;58:03;"I mean, especially-- those are three whoppers right there."
58:03;58:05;"- Axel wrote ""November Rain,"""
58:05;58:08;"but Duff invested early in Starbucks and Amazon."
58:08;58:10;"- I think it's brilliant. - Yeah."
58:10;58:12;"- Starbucks is-- but if he gets out now,"
58:12;58:14;"it might stay-- 'cause it seems like, well,"
58:14;58:16;"every once in a while, but they're too, you know--"
58:16;58:18;"there's things to thank Starbucks for,"
58:18;58:20;"but it's sometimes a bit of a rocky road."
58:20;58:22;"But it's too big now. It doesn't matter."
58:22;58:23;"It's everywhere. - It's too big to go."
58:23;58:25;"- It's in Japan. - No, no, no."
58:25;58:28;"- It's like the [bleep] coffee shop if you're in Japan,"
58:28;58:31;"but it's still just packed with people 'cause free Wi-Fi."
58:31;58:33;"- They open thousands in China every year."
58:33;58:35;"Wait, but Dave, did--"
58:35;58:38;"there's a Dave Matthews Ben & Jerry's, right?"
58:38;58:41;"- Well, I think it-- there was, but it was disappointing."
58:41;58:43;"- [laughs]"
58:43;58:45;"- Do you mean the flavor was disappointing or the sales?"
58:45;58:47;"- I think so, because I think it was all right."
58:47;58:50;"I think sales were directly proportionate to flavor."
58:50;58:52;"- [laughs]"
58:52;58:54;"- It was good. I think--I feel like it had--"
58:54;58:56;"I think every time I said something--"
58:56;58:59;"I think there was one-- look, I think there were two flavors."
58:59;59:01;"- There was one Sweet World."
59:01;59:03;"- And I think that was all right,"
59:03;59:05;"but then I feel like there was a different flavor"
59:05;59:08;"that was, like, some kind of berry flavor,"
59:08;59:10;"and I didn't like that at all."
59:10;59:12;"Not that I didn't like it, but it was just, like,"
59:12;59:14;"if you had the choice of having fish food--"
59:14;59:16;"- Or Cherry Garcia. - Or Cherry Garcia,"
59:16;59:18;"then you just wouldn't have it."
59:18;59:20;"- And so they didn't consult you?"
59:20;59:22;"- No, I think they did with the ones--"
59:22;59:24;"- Take us back through this. How does this all start?"
59:24;59:26;"- Well, I can't remember. I know that--"
59:26;59:28;"- [laughs] - I know that--"
59:28;59:30;"- Honest answer. - I know Ben and Jerry"
59:30;59:32;"didn't shave their necks."
59:32;59:34;"That's what I--I remember the back of their necks"
59:34;59:36;"were hairy."
59:36;59:38;"- Extremely hairy. - So that just struck me,"
59:38;59:40;"that I was like, ""Wow."" - That's pretty graphic."
59:40;59:44;"- I was definitely primarily focused on ice cream flavors."
59:44;59:46;"And not that we all should shave our necks,"
59:46;59:49;"but they were at a point where they're fuzzy."
59:49;59:52;"And then I still love--they were super fun to hang out with."
59:52;59:57;"And then I told them all the flavors I liked."
59:57;59:59;"I think there was maybe a bump 'cause they were like,"
59:59;01:00:01;"""Well, that's--we already have that flavor."""
01:00:01;01:00:03;"But I thought One Sweet World was fine."
01:00:03;01:00:05;"I don't think it was, like, a screaming--"
01:00:05;01:00:07;"maybe the name was weak as well."
01:00:07;01:00:09;"- Well, there was also Magic-- - 'Cause, like, fish food"
01:00:09;01:00:12;"is great. That's a great name for a--"
01:00:12;01:00:14;"- There was also Magic Brownies."
01:00:14;01:00:16;"Black raspberry ice cream"
01:00:16;01:00:19;"swirled with sweet cream ice cream and fudge brownie."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"So the chocolate fruit combo-- - That sounds really good."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"- I don't know, that was-- - Chocolate fruit?"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"- That was Dave Matthews' Magic Brownies?"
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Yes. - Uh, yes."
01:00:26;01:00:28;"- Dave Matthews' band, Magic Brownies."
01:00:28;01:00:30;"I just like to be specific here."
01:00:30;01:00:32;"- So you've had two-- - The blame for that flavor,"
01:00:32;01:00:35;"if you don't like it, goes five ways or seven ways,"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"depending on when-- - Right."
01:00:37;01:00:38;"Wait, but you don't remember that?"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"- I do now that I--now that I see it,"
01:00:40;01:00:42;"I don't remember it clearly."
01:00:42;01:00:43;"But is that--I wonder if that's--"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"maybe that's available now, you think?"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"- I think both were discontinued."
01:00:47;01:00:50;"- Yeah. - So you've had two failed ventures."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"- I don't know, I'm sorry."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"I don't want to consider them failures"
01:00:54;01:00:57;"because I don't think I put that much effort--"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"- It's the journey, not the destination."
01:00:59;01:01:03;"- Yeah, and also I didn't put all that much effort in them."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"I like to eat ice cream more"
01:01:04;01:01:07;"than I like to invent ice cream flavors."
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- Which are great, too, ice cream flavor."
01:01:09;01:01:10;"- I want someone else--that's fair."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"- Yeah, what are you eating? Are you eating fish food?"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"- I've had fish food before."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"Sometimes what happens is I go to the grocery store"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"and then I just get whatever ice cream looks"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"like it's delicious to me,"
01:01:22;01:01:23;"which is most ice cream."
01:01:23;01:01:26;"But I--what about you? Hey, what about you, Ezra?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"What do you think of when you think of--"
01:01:28;01:01:29;"are you, like, a purist?"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"Do you prefer high-quality vanilla?"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"Do you prefer--"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"- Yeah, I think for me, nothing's really gonna be"
01:01:35;01:01:38;"just, like, Haagen-Dazs coffee ice cream, for instance."
01:01:38;01:01:41;"But, you know, I'll go check out the newer brands,"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"the Jennys of the world."
01:01:43;01:01:45;"- That's a really good ice cream, the Jenny."
01:01:45;01:01:47;"Nicely just-- - Yeah, yeah, Jenny's is good."
01:01:47;01:01:49;"But, you know, sometimes it's, like, enough already"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"with all, like, the bells and whistles"
01:01:51;01:01:52;"and the different kinds of--"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"you know, I kind of like the classics."
01:01:54;01:01:57;"But I do want to say I have this funny feeling"
01:01:57;01:01:58;"that for you and Ben and Jerry's,"
01:01:58;01:01:59;"third time's the charm."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"- You think I should go back in?"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- I think just really think about it this time."
01:02:03;01:02:04;"- Black raspberry. - Really?"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"- Black raspberry chocolate swirl."
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- I think you get it one more time,"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"you knock it out of the park."
01:02:11;01:02:14;"It doesn't sit right that your flavors are discontinued."
01:02:14;01:02:17;"- I don't know, I think it's something about the name."
01:02:17;01:02:20;"Like, like, Fish is a perfect name"
01:02:20;01:02:22;"to attach anything to"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"and have a great ice cream flavor."
01:02:25;01:02:28;"Kerry Garcia sounds good to me."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"Dave Matthews Band ice cream."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Right away, it's just like, this is a terrible--"
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- How about-- - A Bill song."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"- How about-- - Doesn't matter how delicious it is."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- Yeah, do a Bill song."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"How about Dave's Killer Ice Cream?"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"- Dave's Killer Ice Cream."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"- I like Dave's Killer Ice Cream."
01:02:41;01:02:44;"And it's a picture of you playing guitar."
01:02:44;01:02:45;"- DM Bill Tong."
01:02:45;01:02:48;"I know there's something there."
01:02:48;01:02:49;"- Oh yeah."
01:02:49;01:02:51;"- There's definitely something there."
01:02:51;01:02:52;"- There's something there."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"- I love that there's just something there."
01:02:54;01:02:58;"Jesus Christ, we have to get away from ice cream and Bill Tong."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"- Delicious, milky Bill Tong."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"No, yeah, if you can figure out,"
01:03:00;01:03:03;"if you can figure out a flavor where the initials are DMB"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"and it's just called DMB, that's tight."
01:03:05;01:03:06;"- That would be better."
01:03:06;01:03:07;"- I'm going to the freezer."
01:03:07;01:03:08;"- Double marshmallow."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"- I'm grabbing some fish food."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"- Brownie."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- Double marshmallow."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"- Double marshmallow brownie."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"That's it."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- It's already a pretty good flavor."
01:03:15;01:03:16;"- Exactly."
01:03:16;01:03:17;"- It could be subliminal."
01:03:17;01:03:19;"No, we don't even have to take any credit for it."
01:03:19;01:03:22;"That'll give it an advantage too."
01:03:22;01:03:25;"- No, but I mean, you and the guys still need to get your royalty though."
01:03:25;01:03:27;"- Is there a royalty in ice cream?"
01:03:27;01:03:29;"Just because the scene doesn't seem like that's a--"
01:03:29;01:03:30;"- You tell us."
01:03:30;01:03:31;"- I don't know."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- You had two ice creams."
01:03:32;01:03:33;"- I don't feel like I was--"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"I don't think I was at a meeting where I said,"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"""Listen, (beep) damn it."
01:03:36;01:03:41;"You put the name of this band on an ice cream flavor and we want 10%."""
01:03:41;01:03:42;"- Maybe we said--"
01:03:42;01:03:48;"- Could you plant a tree in honor of Dave Matthews Band?"
01:03:48;01:03:52;"Then something like earnest and nice feeling,"
01:03:52;01:03:56;"we could demand that and not settle for less."
01:03:56;01:04:00;"- Yeah, you probably paid for a scholarship at Burlington Community College."
01:04:00;01:04:01;"- There you go."
01:04:01;01:04:02;"Dreams do come true."

01:04:37;01:04:43;"towards the end of his life, Jerry is quoted as saying to people close to him"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"when he was super burned out on touring,"
01:04:45;01:04:48;"""You know, I could just live off the ice cream money now."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Maybe I don't need to tour so hard."""
01:04:50;01:04:52;"- That's pretty solid."
01:04:52;01:04:56;"It's just like him and Gene Simmons had the same vibe."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"They're both like, ""You know what?"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Getting a little tired of this touring thing."
01:05:00;01:05:03;"I'm going to diversify my portfolio."""
01:05:03;01:05:05;"- You might not need to tour so much, Dev."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"- Just relax."
01:05:07;01:05:09;"- You're one ice cream away."
01:05:09;01:05:13;"- One delicious flavor of double marshmallow brownie."
01:05:13;01:05:17;"Just sit back and fatten up a little bit."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"A wee bit."
01:05:18;01:05:19;"- Exactly."
01:05:19;01:05:20;"Let's get you back."
01:05:20;01:05:22;"When's the last time you talked to Ben or Jerry?"
01:05:22;01:05:24;"- It's been a long time, but I do--"
01:05:24;01:05:29;"my only recollection is that they seem to be truly nice guys."
01:05:29;01:05:31;"That's the only way I can describe--"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"I don't know what else to say, but what else--"
01:05:33;01:05:34;"how else could--"
01:05:34;01:05:37;"because that's sort of the perfect business,"
01:05:37;01:05:41;"born of a good idea when you're stoned."
01:05:41;01:05:42;"Because there's no other way that they just--"
01:05:42;01:05:46;"what they would do is they'd just sit around in college and get--"
01:05:46;01:05:47;"and maybe this is totally wrong,"
01:05:47;01:05:51;"but it seems to me that they sat around and got a--"
01:05:51;01:05:55;"they went to the grocery store, bought a ton of candy."
01:05:55;01:05:57;"Like, they went--they got--"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"they didn't get any Clif Bars,"
01:05:59;01:06:02;"but they got, like, the--"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"what are--they got those Heath Bars?"
01:06:04;01:06:05;"- Heath Bars, yeah."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- They got, like, Mars Bars."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"Maybe they got some Snickers."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"They got chocolate ice cream."
01:06:10;01:06:13;"They got fudge, and they just stirred it all together."
01:06:13;01:06:17;"Then they just were munching, and they were high as kites."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"And they said, ""We should sell this."""
01:06:20;01:06:21;"And then they're like, ""What?"""
01:06:21;01:06:22;"And then, now."
01:06:22;01:06:25;"- They crushed it. - And now it's just--"
01:06:25;01:06:26;"and then now."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And, like, they just-- that's what happened."
01:06:28;01:06:31;"They weren't--there wasn't a whole period"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"where they made questionable decisions."
01:06:33;01:06:35;"- We've talked about on the show, though,"
01:06:35;01:06:39;"early '80s Burlington, Vermont produced Fish,"
01:06:39;01:06:42;"Bernie Sanders, and Ben & Jerry's,"
01:06:42;01:06:43;"and that's a small town."
01:06:43;01:06:48;"- And so Bernie makes everything, like, super legit."
01:06:48;01:06:51;"It's, like, he's the most righteous."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"- Yep."
01:06:52;01:06:58;"- And then Fish, also deeply legitimate, you know."
01:06:58;01:07:00;"Just all about the people."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Yep. - Let's get this right."
01:07:02;01:07:04;"They're not gonna phone it in."
01:07:04;01:07:06;"They're not gonna get on stage just one time"
01:07:06;01:07:10;"and just say, ""No, tonight, let's just get it over with."""
01:07:10;01:07:12;"That's never even happened."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"Even the shows that Trey doesn't remember,"
01:07:15;01:07:16;"he didn't think that."
01:07:16;01:07:19;"And I love Trey, and so let me just get that out of the way."
01:07:19;01:07:21;"It wasn't a malicious dig."
01:07:21;01:07:22;"It was just a joyful--"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"- No, no, you've performed with them, right?"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"- A joyful dig."
01:07:25;01:07:26;"And ice cream."
01:07:26;01:07:29;"If the whole world could be like Burlington, Vermont,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"I think everything would be better."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"- That's Burlington, Vermont, early '80s."
01:07:33;01:07:35;"Take us to late '80s, early '90s,"
01:07:35;01:07:38;"Charlottesville, Virginia."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"Obviously, you're the Trey in that scenario."
01:07:41;01:07:42;"- Well..."
01:07:42;01:07:43;"- What was the ice cream scene like?"
01:07:43;01:07:44;"- I don't know."
01:07:44;01:07:47;"I mean, there was ice cream there,"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"and no Bernie Sanders."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"- There's no Bernie equivalent."
01:07:51;01:07:52;"- I've got all the other ingredients."
01:07:52;01:07:55;"I've got, you know, the creepy, insane people,"
01:07:55;01:07:58;"and then I've got all the people that came to the bar"
01:07:58;01:08:00;"that irritated me that I worked at."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"And then I've got my family there,"
01:08:02;01:08:04;"and then I'd walk to work."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"I lived in my mom's basement for a while,"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"then I got my own house,"
01:08:07;01:08:09;"and then I rented with some friends"
01:08:09;01:08:10;"and lived near a graveyard."
01:08:10;01:08:11;"I mean, there's all the other garbage"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"that gets in the way of me trying to think"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"of, you know, three words that would kind of capture"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"late '80s Charlottesville, Virginia."
01:08:18;01:08:20;"- Right, 'cause you were actually there."
01:08:20;01:08:22;"- But there was ice cream there,"
01:08:22;01:08:25;"but I don't have any particular memories of it."
01:08:25;01:08:26;"There was a cool--"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"I worked in a bar with a pretty awesome--"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"there was a lot of great jazz musicians there,"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"but, you know, that slows--"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"you know, generally, that slows the conversation"
01:08:34;01:08:35;"down a little bit."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"- Can I ask you a couple questions"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"from my vantage point of Charlottesville,"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"a place I've been a couple times on tour?"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"- You were just in Japan, weren't you?"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"I read that on the piece of paper."
01:08:43;01:08:45;"- I was--yeah, I was just living in Japan"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"for six months."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"- Jeez, that's awesome."
01:08:47;01:08:49;"I wasn't there for a little while,"
01:08:49;01:08:50;"and that was awesome."
01:08:50;01:08:51;"Carry on with your question."
01:08:51;01:08:53;"We can talk about Japan more later."
01:08:53;01:08:54;"- Beautiful country."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"- Oh, my God. - Yes, please."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"- I was ready to go there, stay there."
01:08:58;01:08:59;"- But Charlottesville--"
01:08:59;01:09:03;"so, Charlottesville, in that era,"
01:09:03;01:09:05;"there was, like, a hippie, dippy element,"
01:09:05;01:09:08;"but you also have the kind of Confederate flags,"
01:09:08;01:09:11;"and what is the vibe of that era of Charlottesville?"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"I mean, it's a beautiful town,"
01:09:13;01:09:15;"but when you're coming up there,"
01:09:15;01:09:16;"did you feel like--you were like,"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"""Oh, I'm in a really cool college town""?"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"Did you feel like, ""I'm finding cool musicians"
01:09:21;01:09:22;"in spite of the vibe""?"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"Like, you know what I mean?"
01:09:24;01:09:25;"How would you describe the atmosphere?"
01:09:25;01:09:29;"- The old South vibe is in the '80s."
01:09:29;01:09:30;"By that time, it was certainly--"
01:09:30;01:09:33;"it was a little more--somewhat subdued."
01:09:33;01:09:35;"You'd probably have to walk in the right circles"
01:09:35;01:09:37;"for it to be too obvious."
01:09:37;01:09:38;"It was maybe more college town,"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"and I think the city itself is even maybe"
01:09:41;01:09:44;"a little more left-leaning, a little--"
01:09:44;01:09:47;"you know, that was a big change from 20 years before,"
01:09:47;01:09:50;"probably, or the decades before that."
01:09:50;01:09:53;"I think it's a fairly enlightened town,"
01:09:53;01:09:54;"but that--you know, but where it is"
01:09:54;01:09:58;"and where it came from maybe doesn't always reflect that."
01:09:58;01:09:59;"And the surrounding area--"
01:09:59;01:10:02;"you know, Virginia's--a lot of Virginia's"
01:10:02;01:10:05;"very old, older ideas,"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"but at the same time, it's a sort of--"
01:10:07;01:10:08;"it's a unique place,"
01:10:08;01:10:09;"so there's a lot of musicians"
01:10:09;01:10:11;"that moved there from all over the place,"
01:10:11;01:10:13;"and so there was a pretty heavy jazz scene,"
01:10:13;01:10:16;"and then obviously it's not only the Confederate side."
01:10:16;01:10:19;"It's also--there's a big black community in Virginia,"
01:10:19;01:10:22;"and so that has a big influence in Charlottesville,"
01:10:22;01:10:25;"at least, and that has a big influence on the ideas"
01:10:25;01:10:28;"and the feeling of the town,"
01:10:28;01:10:29;"and then also the university"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"brings a sort of forward thinking."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"There's--I suppose there's a bit of a hippie-dippie thing,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"but that's maybe not quite as prevalent"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"as it is in Burlington."
01:10:38;01:10:40;"- All right, so that was kind of ultimately--"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"you can't really compare Charlottesville to Burlington."
01:10:42;01:10:45;"- And Charlottesville really hit it out of the park"
01:10:45;01:10:47;"with the Nazi types"
01:10:47;01:10:50;"when a smaller group of people, I suppose,"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"were connected to Charlottesville directly,"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"and then a lot of imported people"
01:10:54;01:10:57;"came and did that Unite the Right rally."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"- Right, the infamous march."
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Yeah, right, those people--"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"most of those people were not from Charlottesville."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"- I mean, that shook up Charlottesville really."
01:11:03;01:11:06;"You know, suddenly the whole world knew this town"
01:11:06;01:11:07;"for one thing,"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"and so that was pretty awful,"
01:11:09;01:11:12;"but I don't think reflects Charlottesville"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"proper, the general spirit."
01:11:14;01:11:16;"I mean, obviously there's some dark--"
01:11:16;01:11:17;"you know, in living memory,"
01:11:17;01:11:20;"some pretty dark episodes in Charlottesville"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"and leveling of the black neighborhood,"
01:11:22;01:11:25;"and, you know, which happened all over the country,"
01:11:25;01:11:26;"which is awful,"
01:11:26;01:11:29;"and we all can hold a little responsibility"
01:11:29;01:11:31;"of where things are now"
01:11:31;01:11:33;"just because of the past of the country,"
01:11:33;01:11:35;"but I think it's a pretty vibrant"
01:11:35;01:11:38;"and pretty progressive place"
01:11:38;01:11:41;"as far as most of the country's concerned."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"I think it's always a little bit more progressive"
01:11:43;01:11:45;"than the overall average of the country,"
01:11:45;01:11:48;"which is--it's a good part of the world."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"There's always gonna be one or two ass[bleep]"

01:11:54;01:11:55;"Surely not."

01:13:24;01:13:26;"How much of a Deadhead were you?"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"You know, people call you a jam band,"
01:13:28;01:13:31;"so of course they draw the Dead comparison."
01:13:31;01:13:34;"Like, how deep were you into the Dead in those years?"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"- None. - None?"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"- None for me. Zero."
01:13:38;01:13:41;"I don't know if this is--"
01:13:41;01:13:43;"- You just blew the lid."
01:13:43;01:13:47;"- I never saw the Dead until we opened for them in Vegas,"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"and that's the first time I ever saw the Dead."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- When was that, like, the last couple years of Jerry's life?"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Like, really towards the end?"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"- A year before Jerry died."
01:13:56;01:13:59;"I had an acoustic record of theirs..."
01:13:59;01:14:00;"- Reckoning? - ...when I was younger."
01:14:00;01:14:03;"A record, an album when I was younger"
01:14:03;01:14:04;"that I liked a lot."
01:14:04;01:14:07;"- Reckoning. - Yeah, I liked that record."
01:14:07;01:14:08;"- The live acoustic record, yeah, sure."
01:14:08;01:14:12;"- But then, you know, I spent a lot of my time in Africa"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"when I probably-- I was discovering music,"
01:14:14;01:14:18;"and then I was a mad Beatles fan when I was younger,"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"and so I moved from that."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"And then I loved, like, Pink Floyd"
01:14:23;01:14:26;"and things that I guess grew somewhat out of that."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"And then, I don't know, when I went to Africa,"
01:14:28;01:14:32;"the Dead were not big in South Africa,"
01:14:32;01:14:35;"and so I didn't really have a lot of exposure to them."
01:14:35;01:14:39;"And then I moved to the States, and that time I was more"
01:14:39;01:14:42;"maybe into jazz, African jazz,"
01:14:42;01:14:45;"and got into that a little bit more."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"So at some point in there,"
01:14:47;01:14:50;"I was into a lot of metal as well."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"- Okay. - I just really liked metal,"
01:14:52;01:14:53;"but that's 'cause I was a teenager"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"and I was really excited about metal."
01:14:55;01:14:58;"- Like what fans? - I hope it's not lame."
01:14:58;01:15:02;"I loved Van Halen when I was, like, 13 and 14."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"I loved-- - Yeah."
01:15:04;01:15:07;"- It hit me in the right spot. Judas Priest."
01:15:07;01:15:11;"And AC/DC was comforting to me as a kid,"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"so that was--I guess it's like--"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"it's really like pop music of heavy metal."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"It was what I listened to, you know,"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"and then Status Quo and, I guess, like--"
01:15:23;01:15:26;"I was just talking to my friend about the Irish--"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"maybe they were heavy metal, but they--"
01:15:28;01:15:31;"- Thin Lizzy? - Yeah."
01:15:31;01:15:32;"I was gonna say Phil Lynott."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- Phil Lynott, yeah. - And Lizzy."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"- Yeah, the greatest. - There was a point"
01:15:35;01:15:37;"at which everyone put on--"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"all those bands followed Van Halen"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"and started wearing spandex,"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"and then I don't know, I started to feel like"
01:15:43;01:15:45;"something was going wrong."
01:15:45;01:15:47;"Just emotionally, I felt like something strange"
01:15:47;01:15:49;"was happening to heavy metal,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"or at least to hard rock, and that was maybe--"
01:15:52;01:15:53;"- Well, so let's get specific."
01:15:53;01:15:55;"Like, you're in your early 20s,"
01:15:55;01:15:57;"living in Charlottesville, the years before--"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"- Then I was not listening to heavy metal."
01:15:59;01:16:00;"- '89, '90--so you were not--"
01:16:00;01:16:03;"you did not buy ""Dr. Feelgood"" by Motley Crue?"
01:16:03;01:16:05;"- No, I did not. So I was-- - You're done."
01:16:05;01:16:07;"- I don't know why. I felt like if I--"
01:16:07;01:16:10;"it should have been mid--up to the mid '80s,"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"I was into metal,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"or at least moving away from it,"
01:16:14;01:16:18;"and then I just don't think that I was ever exposed"
01:16:18;01:16:23;"to the Grateful Dead until maybe the late '80s,"
01:16:23;01:16:25;"and then I didn't--it hadn't grabbed me."
01:16:25;01:16:26;"I knew there was a whole culture..."
01:16:26;01:16:28;"- Yes. - Of that,"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"and I knew that people were devoted to it,"
01:16:30;01:16:32;"and since then, like, I feel like"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"ten years into the band,"
01:16:34;01:16:38;"I started listening to way more dead and go,"
01:16:38;01:16:39;"""Man, these guys were--"""
01:16:39;01:16:41;"You know, 'cause there was this weird part of me"
01:16:41;01:16:44;"that was like, there's this whole culture"
01:16:44;01:16:46;"that I'm--that I missed, you know?"
01:16:46;01:16:49;"And then I feel like it was after Jerry died"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"that I started listening--"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"I think first I was turned on--"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"I thought the Jerry Garcia band"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"kind of hooked me a little better."
01:16:57;01:16:58;"- Ah, yeah. - And then I was like,"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"""Wow, this band is--these guys are killing,"""
01:17:00;01:17:04;"and then I started listening more to the Grateful Dead"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"and started appreciating it more,"
01:17:06;01:17:09;"but I hate to admit all my deep ignorance,"
01:17:09;01:17:10;"but I was like--it was so funny."
01:17:10;01:17:12;"- No, but that's-- - I remember reading--"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"I remember reading an article where this guy said,"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"""There's a lot of jam bands that owe a lot"
01:17:17;01:17:18;"to the Grateful Dead,"
01:17:18;01:17:21;"but the Dave Matthews band should just give"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"all their royalties to the Grateful Dead,"""
01:17:23;01:17:25;"and just--and I was like, ""Oh, that's so interesting,"""
01:17:25;01:17:27;"'cause I--you know, there was one--"
01:17:27;01:17:30;"the one guy in the band who maybe was"
01:17:30;01:17:31;"a little more into the dead"
01:17:31;01:17:34;"and had grown up in that scene was Boyd,"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"who played violin, was--"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"he was the guy who knew a little more,"
01:17:38;01:17:41;"but everyone else--not that we were all listening"
01:17:41;01:17:42;"to similar music--"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"everyone else was kind of in different places."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"I don't know. Everyone else came from different--"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"came from jazz or came from Motown"
01:17:49;01:17:52;"or came from soul or came from, you know, punk or--"
01:17:52;01:17:53;"- That's--well, look, obviously,"
01:17:53;01:17:55;"whoever wrote that couldn't really hear"
01:17:55;01:17:58;"because DMB does not sound like the dead,"
01:17:58;01:18:03;"but because you were the biggest jam band"
01:18:03;01:18:04;"or people called you a jam band,"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"you know, in the '90s, of course,"
01:18:06;01:18:09;"people would feel the need to, like, you know,"
01:18:09;01:18:13;"retcon the story that the dead were your,"
01:18:13;01:18:14;"you know, forefathers,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"even though the--so, okay, so safe to say"
01:18:16;01:18:19;"the early, initial Dave Matthews albums"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"had no direct dead influence"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"'cause you just weren't listening to it"
01:18:23;01:18:24;"for ""Under the Table"" and ""Dreaming"""
01:18:24;01:18:25;"- I feel like I had more--"
01:18:25;01:18:27;"the way I sang sounded more like"
01:18:27;01:18:31;"I'd been listening to Kermit the Frog or something."
01:18:31;01:18:33;"Those early records, I'm like, ""What is that?"""
01:18:33;01:18:35;"- ""Rainbow Connection,"" that's a good song."
01:18:35;01:18:37;"- You know, I really do feel like, you know,"
01:18:37;01:18:38;"it's like-- - What about, like,"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Van Morrison or something?"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"- Absolutely. - Like, Astral Week?"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"- Yeah, I listen to-- - That's your guy."
01:18:44;01:18:46;"- Those, I listen to a lot of that,"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"mainly 'cause my brother--my brother turned me on--"
01:18:48;01:18:51;"I feel like my brother was the great influence"
01:18:51;01:18:52;"in my older brother."
01:18:52;01:18:54;"He's five years older, and he--"
01:18:54;01:18:57;"you know, he was the person that turned me on to--"
01:18:57;01:19:00;"I think all the folk music or Van Morrison"
01:19:00;01:19:03;"or, you know, then later on Joe Jackson,"
01:19:03;01:19:06;"but I think, you know, the Beatles first,"
01:19:06;01:19:09;"and then Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin,"
01:19:09;01:19:11;"and then Bob Dylan."
01:19:11;01:19:13;"I think everything-- - Joni?"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"- Yeah, absolutely, Joni Mitchell,"
01:19:15;01:19:17;"Neil Young. - Ah, yeah."
01:19:17;01:19:19;"- You know, he-- - All the classics."
01:19:19;01:19:23;"- All that stuff in the '70s was 'cause of my brother,"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"and I kind of--I sat with the stuff"
01:19:25;01:19:28;"that was sort of-- that had already happened"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"when I was--that was-- - Right."
01:19:30;01:19:31;"- I was listening to a lot of stuff"
01:19:31;01:19:33;"that had already happened."
01:19:33;01:19:34;"That was my focus."
01:19:34;01:19:37;"- What about any kind of, like, alternative music?"
01:19:37;01:19:38;"Were you ever into The Smiths?"
01:19:38;01:19:42;"- Oh, sure, but I wasn't, like, crazy about The Smiths,"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"but I liked his--I liked his voice."
01:19:44;01:19:45;"I liked the guitar player."
01:19:45;01:19:47;"What's the guitar player's name?"
01:19:47;01:19:48;"- Johnny Mara, amazing."
01:19:48;01:19:50;"- Jesus, that guy is an-- - Yeah, he's the man."
01:19:50;01:19:51;"- He knows me."
01:19:51;01:19:54;"- I thought, like, he was a crazy genius"

01:21:55;01:21:56;"- I didn't listen to a lot of the Meat Puppets."
01:21:56;01:21:59;"- Yeah, I'm just curious about these '80s"
01:21:59;01:22:00;"kind of like alternative bands that were--"
01:22:00;01:22:01;"- 'Cause you can think of all these, yeah,"
01:22:01;01:22:03;"what about like the Stone Roses?"

01:24:15;01:24:16;"- Right, Peter Gabriel."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"That was one I wanted to ask you about."
01:24:18;01:24:19;"- I think at that stage,"
01:24:19;01:24:22;"it was a little bit of an obsession."
01:24:22;01:24:23;"And Kate Bush."
01:24:23;01:24:28;"I was so glad that Kate Bush had a bizarre resurgence."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"It was like when Journey had a resurgence,"
01:24:31;01:24:32;"which is just fine."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"'Cause we brought Journey back"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"right to the front of everything."
01:24:36;01:24:37;"I was like, ""What is happening?"""
01:24:37;01:24:38;"- Yeah, and The Sopranos."
01:24:38;01:24:40;"- When I was listening to Led Zeppelin,"
01:24:40;01:24:43;"you wouldn't admit that you liked Journey."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"When I was living in Austin,"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"you wouldn't go to the other guys and say,"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"""You know, I like that band Journey."""
01:24:48;01:24:49;"'Cause people would be like,"
01:24:49;01:24:51;"""What are you, you like Journey?"
01:24:51;01:24:52;"""What are you?"""
01:24:52;01:24:53;"- Yeah, but those songs."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"- But then Journey came back."
01:24:54;01:24:55;"- They're all-timers, yeah."
01:24:55;01:24:57;"- They're awesome, but you just, you know,"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"it's like even if you like it,"
01:24:58;01:24:59;"you can't say anything."
01:24:59;01:25:00;"Then they had a whole resurgence."
01:25:00;01:25:03;"But I felt like resurgences were really justified"
01:25:03;01:25:06;"when Kate Bush exploded onto the scene."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"- She's truly one of the all-time greats."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"- Yeah, so I was obsessed by,"
01:25:09;01:25:10;"Kate Bush was also."
01:25:10;01:25:13;"- You're listening to Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush."
01:25:13;01:25:14;"What about Paul Simon?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"- Talking heads!"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"- Oh, talking heads, sure."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"- What's happening?"
01:25:17;01:25:18;"Oh my God, a little bit of,"
01:25:18;01:25:21;"if I walked into a room and David Byrne was in the room"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"and he wasn't on stage and I wasn't in seats,"
01:25:24;01:25:28;"I always think of times that I have an anxiety attack"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"and just get the (beep) out."
01:25:29;01:25:30;"- Have you ever met him?"
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- That's how I feel."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"No, I haven't met him."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"I've been to his shows."
01:25:34;01:25:38;"I went to see the first and the last show of the,"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"when he had the whole-"
01:25:39;01:25:40;"- The Broadway thing?"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"- No, the band with-"
01:25:42;01:25:43;"- St. Vincent?"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"- With St. Vincent, yes."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"- Right."
01:25:46;01:25:47;"- I watched that show."
01:25:47;01:25:48;"That was killing me."
01:25:48;01:25:50;"And the drum band thing he did,"
01:25:50;01:25:52;"that was unbelievable."
01:25:52;01:25:55;"- DMB ever drop a talking heads cover?"
01:25:55;01:25:56;"- We did do,"
01:25:56;01:25:59;"(imitates drumming)"
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- Burning down the house?"
01:26:01;01:26:02;"- Yeah, that's it."
01:26:02;01:26:03;"- Watch out."
01:26:03;01:26:04;"(imitates drumming)"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"- You know, people say, ""Play the deep cuts."""

01:26:10;01:26:12;"and then people go, ""Yay!"""
01:26:12;01:26:13;"They don't even know."
01:26:13;01:26:15;"That's what I, if I'm going to do a cover,"

01:26:51;01:26:53;"I got a pretty time-crisis question"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"'cause you famously cover ""All Along the Watchtower,"""
01:26:56;01:27:00;"Stone Cold classic, one of Bob's bigger songs right now."
01:27:00;01:27:03;"- Yeah, I'm glad that I learned,"
01:27:03;01:27:04;"the way I play that song,"
01:27:04;01:27:08;"I learned when I was before the band got together,"
01:27:08;01:27:11;"but somehow I wasn't real familiar with it."
01:27:11;01:27:13;"Like, a friend of mine in South Africa"
01:27:13;01:27:16;"who's a therapist who told me that I had,"
01:27:16;01:27:18;"he diagnosed me, he told me I had Tourette's,"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"which I don't believe, but that was just an aside."
01:27:20;01:27:24;"But he also taught me ""All Along the Watchtower."""
01:27:24;01:27:27;"When I heard Jimi Hendrix's version of it,"
01:27:27;01:27:29;"I'd already heard it, and I knew it,"
01:27:29;01:27:31;"but I hadn't heard it thoroughly enough."
01:27:31;01:27:33;"This is incredible ignorance,"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"admitting incredible ignorance."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"And when I heard his version, I was like,"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"""Oh, no, I really [bleep] up that song."""
01:27:39;01:27:42;"But it was too late. It was way too late."
01:27:42;01:27:44;"- Well, you already have your version."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"- Yeah, it's good. It's good."
01:27:45;01:27:48;"It's fine, it's fine, but it's no Jimi Hendrix version."
01:27:48;01:27:51;"And then I also--what's his name?"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"Brown. Zach Brown."
01:27:53;01:27:54;"- Oh, yeah, Zach Brown."
01:27:54;01:27:57;"- Was opening for us on the road--doesn't matter."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"He was touring with us on the road,"
01:27:59;01:28:01;"and he sat in on that song."
01:28:01;01:28:05;"He did our version, and I was like, ""Oh."""
01:28:05;01:28:08;"- Nice. - Now I'm the old-timey guy."
01:28:08;01:28:09;"I felt like the old-timey guy."
01:28:09;01:28:11;"I was like, ""Ha ha!"""
01:28:11;01:28:12;"He came out, and he said, ""Ugh!"""
01:28:12;01:28:14;"And I was like, ""What? That's my man."""
01:28:14;01:28:16;"He did it louder and more, but it was--"
01:28:16;01:28:18;"- I mean, as big as that song already was,"
01:28:18;01:28:20;"you still obviously introduced it"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"to hundreds of thousands, millions of people."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"The first version they heard was yours."
01:28:24;01:28:26;"- Yeah, right? That's pretty--it's kind of interesting."
01:28:26;01:28:27;"- That's pretty cool."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"So I understand your sense that you're--"
01:28:29;01:28:30;"you know, you're gonna do a concert."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"You want to do the song that's gonna get people moving."
01:28:32;01:28:34;"But just because it's something we talk about"
01:28:34;01:28:36;"on the show a lot, are you into any deep-cut Bob"
01:28:36;01:28:37;"just as a listener?"
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Are you going deep on, like, weird '80s albums?"
01:28:40;01:28:43;"- I think I know a lot of Bob Dylans."
01:28:43;01:28:45;"Now, I'm not, like, a purist,"
01:28:45;01:28:46;"and I'm not, like--"
01:28:46;01:28:48;"but I think I know a lot of Bob records."
01:28:48;01:28:51;"Like, I--I mean, is ""No Mercy"" a deep--"
01:28:51;01:28:53;"is that a deep-cut record?"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"Or is that--was a smash."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"He kind of came out--"
01:28:55;01:28:57;"- No, but I would say that is a deep cut"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"in that most people listen to the '60s and '70s stuff,"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"so that's late."
01:29:01;01:29:03;"- Yeah, that's '89. - That's '89, yeah."
01:29:03;01:29:05;"- That's '89. That's the long black coup."
01:29:05;01:29:07;"That was a pretty badass record,"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"and--but he made a lot of amazing records"
01:29:10;01:29:11;"that weren't in, you know,"
01:29:11;01:29:14;"when he was precisely in this sort of,"
01:29:14;01:29:15;"I don't know what to call it,"
01:29:15;01:29:17;"sort of divine place where-- - Yes."
01:29:17;01:29:19;"- Despite himself, that he--"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"- We got obsessed with this song,"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"""Brownsville Girl"" from the mid-'80s,"
01:29:22;01:29:25;"which is on--considered his worst album,"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"but still an amazing song."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"- It sucks to, like, make the--"
01:29:29;01:29:30;"but there--he was pumped--"
01:29:30;01:29:32;"he's like Neil Young, pumped out all that--"
01:29:32;01:29:33;"well, not pumped,"
01:29:33;01:29:35;"but he made all these odd records,"
01:29:35;01:29:37;"and whatever his motivation was,"
01:29:37;01:29:39;"it's still, like, [bleep] you."
01:29:39;01:29:41;"That's--he can do whatever the hell he wants."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"That dude, he can, like, just--"
01:29:43;01:29:45;"he can just write ""Cinnamon Girl,"""
01:29:45;01:29:48;"and then everyone else should go [bleep] themselves."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"- No, totally."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"- The fact that he's still going into the studio"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"and making a record, that is enough."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"Yeah, then you just say, ""Okay, great."""
01:29:55;01:29:56;"You don't--you can't complain."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"- His last record was incredible."
01:29:57;01:29:59;"- You can't say, ""Look, I can see old stuff."""
01:29:59;01:30:00;"- Yeah, his last record was incredible."
01:30:00;01:30:02;"And then he's got Willie's Kids playing--"
01:30:02;01:30:04;"I mean, he's unbelievable."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"Neil is the most thorough."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"Um, he's adamantly himself."
01:30:08;01:30:10;"He's, like--he really is a punk."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"- Oh."
01:30:11;01:30:12;"- In the sense that he's, like,"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"""[bleep] that. I'm-a do what I want to do."""
01:30:15;01:30:16;"- No, truly."
01:30:16;01:30:17;"- He's a superhero."
01:30:17;01:30:20;"I don't know why it took me so long to call out Neil"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"and say, ""That's the--he's--'cause he's the [bleep]"""
01:30:23;01:30:24;"I once called him the [bleep]"
01:30:24;01:30:28;"and then I added ""sandwich"" because I--"
01:30:28;01:30:29;"[laughter]"
01:30:29;01:30:32;"Um, 'cause he was being honored somewhere,"
01:30:32;01:30:33;"and I went up and I played a song,"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"and then I said, ""Neil Young is the [bleep]"""
01:30:36;01:30:38;"And then he looked at me, like, nodding,"
01:30:38;01:30:40;"and I said, ""Sandwich."""
01:30:40;01:30:42;"And then--and then he cackled."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"Then he was like--"
01:30:43;01:30:45;"And then I was like, ""Yeah, that's better"
01:30:45;01:30:47;"than making him feel like a badass"
01:30:47;01:30:48;"is to make him laugh."""
01:30:48;01:30:50;"But, uh, I like him a lot."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"He's real, and he speaks his mind,"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"and he's as good--a buddy of mine was, uh,"
01:30:55;01:30:59;"repossessing a boat of Neil's that some guy had--"
01:30:59;01:31:00;"- Nice."
01:31:00;01:31:02;"- A totally separate-- - Wait, wait, wait."
01:31:02;01:31:03;"Hold on, hold on."
01:31:03;01:31:05;"'Cause your buddy is a--is a boat repo man?"
01:31:05;01:31:08;"- No, my buddy builds boats, okay?"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"He's a badass."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"Like, when I met him, he had a little--"
01:31:12;01:31:13;"he was living on a--"
01:31:13;01:31:15;"well, he's sort of half living on his--"
01:31:15;01:31:18;"this fishing boat he turned into a house."
01:31:18;01:31:19;"You know, he'd set it up,"
01:31:19;01:31:21;"taking--he didn't have a space for fish."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"He had a space for beds."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"It was pretty cool."
01:31:23;01:31:25;"Then he has a--had a house in Seattle,"
01:31:25;01:31:28;"and, you know, he would fix, like, uh--"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"he could fix, like, anything,"
01:31:29;01:31:30;"but he would fix, like, wheelhouses,"
01:31:30;01:31:32;"and then now--now he's got--he's built--"
01:31:32;01:31:33;"he's got a shipyard."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"He's building, like, tugboats."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"He's a badass."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"But he knows about boats, and he also knows"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"about the whole Seattle waterway."
01:31:40;01:31:42;"And, um, some--a buddy of his called him"
01:31:42;01:31:45;"and said, ""Look, we got to repossess this boat."
01:31:45;01:31:48;"""This guy took this--you know, bought this boat"
01:31:48;01:31:49;"from Neil Young,"
01:31:49;01:31:51;"but down in the Bay Area,"
01:31:51;01:31:52;"he hasn't paid for it."""
01:31:52;01:31:57;"But I guess maritime law says if someone's on a boat,"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"you can't take the boat."
01:31:58;01:32:01;"You got to wait till they get off the boat,"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"and then you can take the boat."
01:32:03;01:32:04;"But if they're on the boat,"
01:32:04;01:32:06;"it's, like, some kind of, you know,"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"maritime squatters' rights."
01:32:08;01:32:09;"So he called my buddy,"
01:32:09;01:32:12;"so they figured out the guy who was on the boat"
01:32:12;01:32:13;"had a dog,"
01:32:13;01:32:15;"and he was parked in Seattle somewhere--"
01:32:15;01:32:17;"docked or whatever you call it--"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"and the guy had called my friend and said,"
01:32:19;01:32:21;"""Okay, I know when he leaves."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"They've been staking him out."""
01:32:22;01:32:23;"This is so cool."
01:32:23;01:32:26;"The guy was going to repossess the boat."
01:32:26;01:32:28;"He knew a bit about boats,"
01:32:28;01:32:29;"but he was from San Francisco."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"He didn't know how to hightail it"
01:32:31;01:32:32;"in the Seattle area."
01:32:32;01:32:33;"[laughs]"
01:32:33;01:32:35;"So I think it's a funny story."
01:32:35;01:32:36;"So he's been watching the dude,"
01:32:36;01:32:37;"and the dude, every morning,"
01:32:37;01:32:38;"would have to take his dog,"
01:32:38;01:32:40;"but he was--the dude knew that someone"
01:32:40;01:32:42;"was coming to get the boat."
01:32:42;01:32:44;"So the guy had a suspicion,"
01:32:44;01:32:47;"so they had to figure out a consistent time"
01:32:47;01:32:48;"that the guy wasn't on the boat."
01:32:48;01:32:50;"Like, if the guy goes shopping, goes get a coffee,"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"they don't know when that's going to happen."
01:32:52;01:32:53;"Goes to the grocery store."
01:32:53;01:32:54;"He could do that any time."
01:32:54;01:32:56;"So the guy had to walk his dog,"
01:32:56;01:33:00;"and so they knew the guy would get up and walk his dog."
01:33:00;01:33:02;"So he'd go out, and get on the dog,"
01:33:02;01:33:03;"and go down the dock."
01:33:03;01:33:06;"And so they knew that was when they'd have to do it."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"So he'd call my friend and said,"
01:33:07;01:33:08;"""Come down."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"When he walks his dog,"
01:33:10;01:33:12;"we're going to take this boat."""
01:33:12;01:33:14;"And so--my buddy can drive any boat."
01:33:14;01:33:17;"So the guy gets out, takes his dog,"
01:33:17;01:33:18;"and he's walking down there."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"In my mind--maybe I'm making it up--"
01:33:20;01:33:21;"the guy's paranoid."
01:33:21;01:33:24;"He's looking around like someone's trying to get him."
01:33:24;01:33:27;"And then he gets far enough away from the dock."
01:33:27;01:33:29;"And so then these guys go."
01:33:29;01:33:31;"They're trying to look casual, you know,"
01:33:31;01:33:32;"walk down the dock,"
01:33:32;01:33:33;"and then they hop on the boat,"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"at which time the guy notices them."
01:33:35;01:33:37;"But then they've got to figure out how to start the boat."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"They've got to get the [bleep] out of there."
01:33:39;01:33:40;"And then they start going."
01:33:40;01:33:43;"The guy's running down the pier with his dog,"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"and he's trying to get back on the boat."
01:33:45;01:33:47;"They're shoving him--you know, he's, like, trying to grab,"
01:33:47;01:33:49;"and they're shoving him off and everything."
01:33:49;01:33:50;"But the funny part of the story is"
01:33:50;01:33:52;"when they told Neil they're going to get the boat--"
01:33:52;01:33:53;"it was that morning."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"Sorry, I kind of jumped over because I got excited."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"Neil said, ""I'm coming up there,"" you know."
01:33:58;01:33:59;"Like, ""He's going to come."""
01:33:59;01:34:00;"They're like, ""No, we don't need you."""
01:34:00;01:34:01;"""No, I'm coming up there."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"I'm going to help you guys."""
01:34:02;01:34:04;"And he's like, ""We don't need you, Neil."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"""We can just--you just stay at the ranch,"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"and we'll bring your boat back."""
01:34:09;01:34:10;"But I just love the idea that Neil's like,"
01:34:10;01:34:13;"""Yeah, I want to get a couple blows in on that guy."""
01:34:13;01:34:17;"You know, he's an angry hockey-playing Canadian"
01:34:17;01:34:19;"that sings pretty songs like--"
01:34:19;01:34:22;"Neil Young repossessing boats."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"You know, on the side of--"
01:34:24;01:34:26;"Neil Young is a boat repo guy."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"I didn't know the world of boat repo."
01:34:29;01:34:31;"Obviously, everybody knows about cars."
01:34:31;01:34:33;"You know, repo man."
01:34:33;01:34:34;"Yeah."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"He's taking cars, but I didn't know there's maritime law"
01:34:36;01:34:38;"that you can't be on--"
01:34:38;01:34:40;"you have to wait till they get off the boat."
01:34:40;01:34:41;"I mean, it makes sense."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"I guess--"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"What are you going to do, throw the guy into the ocean?"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"I mean, what are you going to do?"
01:34:44;01:34:46;"That's where the law comes from."
01:34:46;01:34:47;"You can't throw someone--"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"if they stole your boat, you can't just murder them."
01:34:50;01:34:52;"Because then it's piracy."
01:34:52;01:34:55;"But Neil Young showing up with a box of donuts"
01:34:55;01:34:57;"and some coffees and being like,"
01:34:57;01:34:59;"I'm getting in on the stakeout."
01:34:59;01:35:00;"Yeah, exactly."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"That's next level."
01:35:01;01:35:04;"And then running down the pier, like, wailing."
01:35:04;01:35:07;"Like, I just imagine Neil, like, just wailing on--"
01:35:07;01:35:10;"the dude's trying to get on the boat with his dog."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"He's trying to throw his dog on the boat."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"He's, like, throwing the dog back off the boat."
01:35:15;01:35:17;"Wails, and the guy's trying to grab the bar,"
01:35:17;01:35:18;"and Neil's whacking him."
01:35:18;01:35:20;"I just love the idea of him being there."
01:35:20;01:35:23;"But I guess cooler heads prevailed,"
01:35:23;01:35:26;"and Neil stayed down at the ranch."
01:35:26;01:35:29;"And those guys got his boat back."
01:35:29;01:35:30;"Wow."
01:35:30;01:35:34;"I want to live with a cinnamon girl."
01:35:34;01:35:40;"I could be happy the rest of my life with a cinnamon girl."
01:35:40;01:35:48;"A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night."
01:35:48;01:35:54;"You see us together, chasing the moonlight, my cinnamon girl."
01:35:55;01:36:01;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
01:36:01;01:36:02;"New album."
01:36:02;01:36:03;"I love the first single."
01:36:03;01:36:07;"I really found the single still, like, surprising and fresh"
01:36:07;01:36:08;"and interesting."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"The beginning almost made me think of Tool."
01:36:11;01:36:13;"That made me just want to ask you--"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"I like that."
01:36:14;01:36:15;"I like Tool a lot."
01:36:15;01:36:18;"But, I mean, I imagined it was more you doing something"
01:36:18;01:36:19;"in kind of, like, an Arabic mode."
01:36:19;01:36:22;"It does sound like Dave Matthews using that kind of, like,"
01:36:22;01:36:25;"scale, but there was something about that vibe where I was like,"
01:36:25;01:36:28;"""Oh, yeah, there's, like, a heaviness to it that reminded me of Tool."""
01:36:28;01:36:29;"You're a fan?"
01:36:29;01:36:31;"Yeah, and I love the-- but I love the way it--"
01:36:31;01:36:33;"it does come in like--"
01:36:33;01:36:36;"it comes in like it's-- like a little thunderous."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"I do like that."
01:36:37;01:36:38;"Yeah."
01:36:38;01:36:39;"I like that."
01:36:39;01:36:40;"It makes me really happy."
01:36:40;01:36:43;"Every time that section comes, even when we play it live,"
01:36:43;01:36:45;"I feel like it's just all of the whole band--"
01:36:45;01:36:48;"everyone's just, like, just-- we're getting excited."
01:36:48;01:36:50;"I'd play it five times a show if I could at the moment."
01:36:50;01:36:53;"I'm still not sick of it, so I get really excited,"
01:36:53;01:36:56;"but we just play it the one time so that nobody throws [bleep] at us."
01:36:56;01:36:58;"But it's so fun to play because it-- even at the--"
01:36:58;01:37:01;"like you said, the beginning has this sort of, you know--"
01:37:01;01:37:02;"♪ Da-na-na-na ♪"
01:37:02;01:37:03;"Yeah, like--"
01:37:03;01:37:06;"Whether it's Middle Eastern or whatever Syrian kind of Turkish--"
01:37:06;01:37:07;"Right."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"♪ Da-na-na-na ♪"
01:37:13;01:37:14;"I like that."
01:37:14;01:37:17;"So it sounds like a bit of a monster, which it is, I hope."
01:37:17;01:37:18;"No, it was--"
01:37:18;01:37:20;"Thank you for saying that. I like that song."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"That's a super strong song, and also, this is album number 10?"
01:37:23;01:37:26;"That sounds right. I mean, it's not--"
01:37:26;01:37:30;"when I think about-- there's some people that are pretty prolific."
01:37:30;01:37:34;"That's, like, one record every five years of you."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"Isn't that about-- no, it's one record every three years."
01:37:36;01:37:37;"Every three."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"Every three years. That's okay. That's okay."
01:37:39;01:37:40;"That sounds right."
01:37:40;01:37:43;"Like, I think the people who really care--"
01:37:43;01:37:45;"well, I don't want to diss the prolific people."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Obviously, there's some amazing ones,"
01:37:46;01:37:48;"but I feel like people who really care,"
01:37:48;01:37:50;"who are thoughtfully deep into your career,"
01:37:50;01:37:52;"still writing a song like that,"
01:37:52;01:37:57;"where you're doing something fresh that is part of your DNA,"
01:37:57;01:37:59;"but something you've never quite done before."
01:37:59;01:38:02;"I think the people who do that, 10 albums, 30 years, sounds right."
01:38:02;01:38:05;"It's actually the same as Radiohead, just about."
01:38:05;01:38:10;"Lord, just nice that you mention their name at the same time."
01:38:10;01:38:12;"That's, like, strange."
01:38:12;01:38:16;"They're up in-- I have them in this-- they're up here."
01:38:16;01:38:18;"I'm still practicing. I love everything."
01:38:18;01:38:21;"I can't-- that's everything they do."
01:38:21;01:38:23;"Everything they do, I go, ""Oh, [bleep] damn it."
01:38:23;01:38:25;"That [bleep] is good."""
01:38:25;01:38:27;"They've done a lot of good works, but so has DMB."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"And, I mean, I think there is a comparison."
01:38:29;01:38:31;"You guys came out around a similar time."
01:38:31;01:38:34;"All I'm saying is, like, they take their time with the record."
01:38:34;01:38:37;"They're at about-- they're at roughly 10 years."
01:38:37;01:38:39;"Maybe they have nine albums over 30 years."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"I'm just saying. It's interesting to me."
01:38:41;01:38:44;"That's the type of stuff, as a fan, I always keep track of."
01:38:44;01:38:47;"Yeah, they do some side stuff, too, which is pretty cool, too."
01:38:47;01:38:49;"Things over there and things over there."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"It's interesting projects."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"Keeping things fresh."
01:38:53;01:38:56;"I just want to know a little bit-- I mean, I'm sure this may be stuff that, like,"
01:38:56;01:38:59;"you talked about on stuff before, but I'm just curious,"
01:38:59;01:39:02;"because you're a legendary live band."
01:39:02;01:39:05;"All these years later, you still have a massive live following."
01:39:05;01:39:07;"You always play big shows."
01:39:07;01:39:11;"Your fans really, really care about the set lists."
01:39:11;01:39:14;"You're a little bit under the magnifying glass, right?"
01:39:14;01:39:17;"Like, the fans, they notice-- there's an expectation, right,"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"that every set list is extremely different."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"How do you do the math?"
01:39:22;01:39:25;"I accept that there's going to be a good percentage of people"
01:39:25;01:39:28;"that are going to be pissed, but then there'll be--"
01:39:28;01:39:31;"I'm not aiming at everybody, but, you know, I guess what I do is,"
01:39:31;01:39:35;"with the help of friends, I look at the set lists"
01:39:35;01:39:39;"over the past few years from that place, wherever we are,"
01:39:39;01:39:43;"and I look through the songs we've played"
01:39:43;01:39:46;"over the last, you know, 5 or 10 shows,"
01:39:46;01:39:50;"and look at those lists, and then I try"
01:39:50;01:39:55;"and make something that I can argue is not repetitious."
01:39:55;01:39:59;"And then take into account that for the people that aren't"
01:39:59;01:40:03;"coming to numerous shows, they're just maybe going to that one,"
01:40:03;01:40:07;"that I should play some songs that maybe they're more familiar with."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"Right, classic singles."
01:40:09;01:40:11;"Catch people's attention, but not too many,"
01:40:11;01:40:14;"and then I think about how the show moves,"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"whether it goes like this, or whether it goes like this,"
01:40:17;01:40:20;"or whether it goes like this, whatever it is that I think."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"I look at it and I go, ""That looks like something"
01:40:22;01:40:26;"that could be entertaining, the pace and the movement of the show."""
01:40:26;01:40:29;"But how are you, like-- I mean, on a scale of, like,"
01:40:29;01:40:32;"between Pearl Jam and Phish,"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"where, like, Phish, there's an expectation"
01:40:34;01:40:37;"that there will not be a single song that's the same"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"within, let's say, a week, and Pearl Jam people know"
01:40:40;01:40:43;"they're going to mix it up, but, like, you're getting a live,"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"like, every show or every other show."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"Where do you fall within that?"
01:40:47;01:40:50;"If I play one place, if we play three nights somewhere,"
01:40:50;01:40:53;"then I'm not going to repeat anything, because--"
01:40:53;01:40:54;"Zero repeats."
01:40:54;01:40:57;"Yeah, because that would be-- I feel like someone's going to get--"
01:40:57;01:40:59;"I don't know, throw something at me."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"What's it like with, like, the new song, where you're just starting to play it,"
01:41:02;01:41:04;"like, still you can't repeat it?"
01:41:04;01:41:07;"I may have, but I generally now, I wouldn't do that."
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Now I would just say no."
01:41:09;01:41:12;"I would try and do all different,"
01:41:12;01:41:14;"probably try not to repeat the night before,"
01:41:14;01:41:17;"the last, you know, maybe the last few shows."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"But that's not how-- No, I'd be, like, just trying to steer clear"
01:41:20;01:41:22;"so people feel like they're getting--"
01:41:22;01:41:25;"Because there are going to be people that are coming to maybe five shows."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"I don't think they're going to be too mad if there's a few repeats."
01:41:28;01:41:34;"And then I do-- Whether it's sometimes, like, a less-known song or not a hit,"
01:41:34;01:41:37;"if there's some song that feels really good,"
01:41:37;01:41:40;"the band seems to be firing on all cylinders,"
01:41:40;01:41:43;"I might repeat that a few nights in a row,"
01:41:43;01:41:45;"just because-- Maybe not a few nights in a row,"
01:41:45;01:41:48;"but maybe play it more than I normally would repeat something."
01:41:48;01:41:52;"You know, it's like sort of just-- There's no real science to it."
01:41:52;01:41:56;"I just don't-- I'm always feeling like I'm-- You know, there's a bit of a balance,"
01:41:56;01:41:59;"but I don't want to-- I want to have a good time because that's essential."
01:41:59;01:42:02;"If I'm in a bad relationship with a song or two,"
01:42:02;01:42:05;"then I'm not going to play it even if people want to hear it."
01:42:05;01:42:07;"I do my best to write a set."
01:42:07;01:42:12;"I think about things like how many times does each musician feature,"
01:42:12;01:42:16;"like, you know, if Jeff takes this solo and Roshani has this solo"
01:42:16;01:42:19;"that I want everyone to have a couple times when they shine."
01:42:19;01:42:23;"Just everybody gets a chance to make their own statement or whatever."
01:42:23;01:42:26;"And then those are like all the things that I think about."
01:42:26;01:42:29;"And then sometimes when I'm on stage, I'm like, ""Ah, I f---ed up."""
01:42:29;01:42:33;"And then also sometimes I'm on stage and I go, ""Let's not play that. Let's play this."""
01:42:33;01:42:37;"I'm mostly curious because you have such a huge, like, tremendous body of work now."
01:42:37;01:42:40;"Once the new album's out and everybody's familiar with it,"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"you have to, like, play so many songs, cover your whole career, mix it up."
01:42:44;01:42:46;"You have so many things to think about."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"Let's say you're, like, touring this summer."
01:42:48;01:42:53;"How many new songs can you do in a set and still hit all those marks you're talking about?"
01:42:53;01:42:59;"Well, I feel like four or five, you know, depending on which ones I choose."
01:42:59;01:43:03;"I think that's good for me. And I'm going to get to it. We can get to them all."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"And then every once in a while, there's a song that, you know, we played a few times"
01:43:06;01:43:09;"and it's like it doesn't really land, so it'll be less frequent."
01:43:09;01:43:14;"But then also some that might, like, ""Madman's Eyes"" right now feels so good when we play it live."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"That's the new single."
01:43:16;01:43:18;"Yeah, I bet. Yeah, I'd love to see that."
01:43:18;01:43:22;"That one, you know, I almost wouldn't necessarily count it as a new one"
01:43:22;01:43:28;"because it's kind of fun because we have a really—not always, but depending on where we are—"
01:43:28;01:43:32;"pretty noisy audience. But that's a fun one because people seem to—"
01:43:32;01:43:34;"at the moment, maybe they don't know it that well—"
01:43:34;01:43:40;"people seem to shut the f*** up for that song and then get really excited at the end, which is kind of nice."
01:43:40;01:43:43;"I could see even if you didn't know that song yet and you were just, like, getting a beer"
01:43:43;01:43:47;"and you're just like, ""Da-na-na-na-na,"" I think you would be, like, turn around and be like, ""What's this one?"""
01:43:47;01:43:53;"It's got some big moves in it that I think are sort of dramatic and it's fun to play."
01:43:53;01:43:54;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:47:48;01:47:52;"Can we do a 90s lightning round?"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"Yeah, can you stick around for a few more minutes?"
01:47:54;01:47:57;"I'm gonna fail. I'm gonna fail hopelessly."
01:47:57;01:48:03;"No, no, it's not like trivia. We're not testing you. We want to just know, do you know these bands?"
01:48:03;01:48:07;"Did you ever have a moment where you were listening to them or a connection to them?"
01:48:07;01:48:10;"That's all. We want to know about you and your relationship. It's not a test."
01:48:10;01:48:17;"Yeah, because your first album came out in '94. You're definitely a prominent act in the '90s."
01:48:17;01:48:20;"I'm just gonna run through some '90s lightning round."
01:48:20;01:48:25;"Off of your thoughts, you could say pass. I'll start right at the top. Red Hot Chili Peppers."
01:48:25;01:48:30;"I like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And they're super nice people, too."
01:48:30;01:48:36;"I don't know. I didn't know them when they were all kids. I get happy when I give it away, give it away. I get happy."
01:48:36;01:48:39;"And Nasty Guitar. Nasty guitars."
01:48:39;01:48:40;"Oh, yeah. Vershante."
01:48:40;01:48:44;"Especially Vershante. Just nasty guitar work."
01:48:44;01:48:46;"My Bloody Valentine."
01:48:46;01:48:50;"I don't know. I know it, but I can't claim."
01:48:50;01:48:51;"Yeah, fair enough."
01:48:51;01:49:02;"But almost because of how it rings in my chest, I gotta tell you that I know this is the opposite of a speed round, what I'm doing right now, but that I should have. That's what I feel."
01:49:02;01:49:06;"No, I mean, things resonate or they don't. It's totally fair."
01:49:06;01:49:20;"Pavement. Pavement. I love it. And also, I have to say that Heavy, and then I have to say that I was surrounded, like, all the people, like, in my Virginia crew, everybody loved Pavement."
01:49:20;01:49:25;"Well, Steve Malchmus and David Berman went to University of Virginia."
01:49:25;01:49:30;"David Berman was, I knew him a little bit, was a friend of my sister's."
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Wow. Really? Whoa."
01:49:32;01:49:37;"RIP. Yeah, RIP. And did you listen to his work? Were you aware of Silver Jews when they were releasing music?"
01:49:37;01:49:44;"I knew them a little bit. I didn't know enough. And then he always, like I said, I knew him and I knew he wrote beautiful music."
01:49:44;01:49:51;"And I think he's, I don't know him enough to be able to say, I like this song or whatever, but I thought it was always beautiful."
01:49:51;01:49:53;"Right, sure. Small world."
01:49:53;01:50:01;"Ween. I knew Ween and I bet I would know a lot of songs if they started right now, I would know the song."
01:50:01;01:50:09;"I probably know the names of my songs a little bit better than the names of their songs, but I have to see it on the list."
01:50:09;01:50:18;"I'd be like, oh yeah, I know that song. So I'm really bad at song names, but I know Ween, but I don't think I ever owned a Ween record. That's a good way to say it."
01:50:18;01:50:25;"You never listened to Pure Guava, which I, you know what I recommend? Today. Throw on 1992's Pure Guava."
01:50:25;01:50:29;"I'm going to get Pure Guava and then I'll get back to you. I think you're not going to regret it."
01:50:29;01:50:35;"Smashing Pumpkins. I know them pretty well, but I think only because everyone knows them really well. And I love it."
01:50:35;01:50:41;"I love it. I think he has one of the best scream whines in the history of all time. Beautiful voice."
01:50:41;01:50:50;"What was it like for your band? Because like, you know, Grunge was like the sort of major kind of commercial juggernaut of the early 90s."
01:50:50;01:50:55;"And then you emerged pretty shortly after that, like on a seriously mainstream level."
01:50:55;01:51:04;"And so how did you feel about your band? Like, did you wonder, like, how do we fit into this kind of Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Son Thupa Pilot's world?"
01:51:04;01:51:14;"Or did you not think about it at all? While we were happening, everything was much heavier and much more, you know, much more of a dirge."
01:51:14;01:51:19;"But I loved all the music that was happening on there. Just we were just doing us. Yeah."
01:51:19;01:51:28;"And so that's funny. So I was like, you know, and it's so weird to think when I think of the music that I listened to growing up,"
01:51:28;01:51:34;"somehow it rubbed off on me in a really different, obtuse sort of invisible way."
01:51:34;01:51:42;"And I don't know how it all happens, but I know that all the heavy music sound that was happening around that time,"
01:51:42;01:51:52;"that sort of kind of dark and sort of reflective and self-focused stuff. I got it, but it wasn't coming out of me."
01:51:52;01:52:02;"Mm hmm. Bjork. I love Bjork. I think that I probably have a similar reaction to meeting her that I'd have if I met David Byrne."
01:52:02;01:52:08;"But then he'd probably be so cool that I'd be like, that I'd be like, oh, you know, he just ends up being a nice guy."
01:52:08;01:52:14;"But I'm just intimidated at the prospect. I feel like she's a different kind of brain."
01:52:14;01:52:20;"Maybe I should be more afraid of her. I feel like David Byrne might not be as bitey."
01:52:20;01:52:24;"I feel like I haven't kicked the s*** out of me out of sheer boredom."
01:52:24;01:52:31;"I haven't met that many historical rock figures, but through my brother, who has a band called the Dirty Projectors,"
01:52:31;01:52:37;"I've met and spent time with David Byrne and Bjork. So it's funny that those are you two."
01:52:37;01:52:43;"That's good. I love that you. My hope is always that people like that will be interesting and somewhat."
01:52:43;01:52:50;"Well, of course, they'll be interesting, but that they'll be at least on some levels warm or inclusive."
01:52:50;01:52:55;"You could actually talk to them. Yeah, but I don't assume it and I'm not going to demand it."
01:52:55;01:53:02;"And I guess I have this weird thing. I think I have it like someone like Tom Waits is the same thing for me."
01:53:02;01:53:08;"I remember seeing him across the lobby of a hotel and it was somewhere odd like Omaha."
01:53:08;01:53:14;"I don't know. It was an odd place to see him across. And it wasn't it wasn't like it was like a sort of,"
01:53:14;01:53:19;"you know, in the vein of a sort of Best Western, you know, was what was available."
01:53:19;01:53:26;"And maybe a step up from a Best Western not to say anything about the Best Western or staying there."
01:53:26;01:53:33;"But it had a sort of a lounge area. And I saw him there."
01:53:33;01:53:39;"And I thought, holy ****, that's Tom Waits. I'm going to get the **** out of here right now."
01:53:39;01:53:46;"I mean, all I wanted to do was go up to him and bug him, but I, you know, way and make an excuse for it."
01:53:46;01:53:48;"But then I was like, you know what? I don't want to get in his way."
01:53:48;01:53:52;"Whenever he's sipping, he's sipping his coffee. He's not doing a damn thing."
01:53:52;01:53:56;"I still want to interrupt that perfect sense of peace."
01:53:56;01:54:00;"So I got the **** out of there and I didn't regret it. I feel like, you know,"
01:54:00;01:54:06;"wouldn't it change his life if I'd gone up there and irritated him?"
01:54:06;01:54:10;"And then I could say I'd gone up and irritated Tom Waits. Who wants to say that?"
01:54:10;01:54:13;"Not me. I could just say I saw him over there. He's over there. There he was."
01:54:13;01:54:19;"Right. Yeah. Some **** from the David Matthews group came up here and bothered me."
01:54:19;01:54:27;"And then this **** from some kind of David Matthews, probably a Christian rock group."
01:54:27;01:54:30;"**** that guy."
01:54:30;01:54:33;"Maybe my last band. I'm just curious about your thoughts on this band."
01:54:33;01:54:40;"I saw someone sent me a video of you and Trey doing a cover of Joe Walsh's Rocky Mountain Way."
01:54:40;01:54:44;"This is a band we've talked a lot about on the show. Thoughts on the Eagles?"
01:54:44;01:54:51;"On one level, it's an undeniable event, right? The Eagles, like hell of a monstrous song."
01:54:51;01:54:54;"I never really listened to the Eagles. My friend, Thomas Lamedico,"
01:54:54;01:54:59;"was a big Eagles fan when I was a kid growing up. Before I moved to South Africa,"
01:54:59;01:55:03;"he used to play the Eagles in Hotel California. All that."
01:55:03;01:55:10;"I remember when I was young thinking, ""The guy that sings like this is the guy that I like the most."""
01:55:10;01:55:17;"Because he just sounded like he was a lot of fun and probably was the most difficult."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"So when I was a kid and I listened, and there were all the harmonies,"
01:55:20;01:55:26;"magnificent harmonies, and the weird thing is my sister, my late sister, Ann,"
01:55:26;01:55:33;"loved Linda Ronstadt. Right when Linda Ronstadt was all the **** in the '70s."
01:55:33;01:55:37;"And my sister would be the Desperado and all these tunes."
01:55:37;01:55:42;"And then I found out that it was the Eagles that were her band."
01:55:42;01:55:47;"And then you hear the Eagles next to those first Linda Ronstadt."
01:55:47;01:55:53;"I was like, ""It is the Eagles."" I was more excited by that information."
01:55:53;01:55:58;"My attachment to the Eagles was increased by that."
01:55:58;01:56:05;"But Joe Walsh of the band, the Eagles, I think he struck gold."
01:56:05;01:56:08;"And I think they all did, obviously. And they're great songwriters."
01:56:08;01:56:14;"But he, I guess, is the overused term. He resonated with me."
01:56:14;01:56:15;"Yeah."
01:56:15;01:56:18;"♪ Somewhere out on that horizon ♪"
01:56:18;01:56:20;"Damn, see, right?"
01:56:20;01:56:24;"But I got a good Joe Walsh story that's a bit of a Kenny Chesney story."
01:56:24;01:56:27;"Kenny Chesney, our paths have crossed."
01:56:27;01:56:30;"Kenny Chesney, yes, the country singer. You know who I'm talking about."
01:56:30;01:56:31;"Kenny Chesney."
01:56:31;01:56:32;"That's right."
01:56:32;01:56:35;"I thought this was pretty ballsy, though, because when you just abandon the idea"
01:56:35;01:56:38;"that an encore is because people want you to come back."
01:56:38;01:56:41;"A lot of times I'm like, ""People don't even want us to come back."""
01:56:41;01:56:44;"""Are they just assuming we're going to walk back out there?"""
01:56:44;01:56:49;"On an aside from my aside, I went to see Black Sabbath with my son."
01:56:49;01:56:53;"That was my heart when I was like 13."
01:56:53;01:56:54;"Oh, yeah. The greatest."
01:56:54;01:56:56;"Black Sabbath. Holy sh*t."
01:56:56;01:56:59;"You did a great Ozzy Osbourne impression on SNL."
01:56:59;01:57:02;"Only because my road manager is a great friend of Ozzy's,"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"and he used to be out with Ozzy's."
01:57:05;01:57:09;"So he just described, he told me, he gave me the whole body language thing."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"So he gave me a blow by blow."
01:57:11;01:57:16;"At times that I've met Ozzy, I've said, ""Just so you know, I'm a mad fan from the deepest part."""
01:57:16;01:57:18;"""I'm like an old fan."""
01:57:18;01:57:23;"But Ozzy went off stage, and then he was off stage,"
01:57:23;01:57:27;"and then he, it was his voice, nobody else, I don't know if you guys have seen"
01:57:27;01:57:29;"been to see Black Sabbath. It's a pretty killing show."
01:57:29;01:57:34;"He started saying, ""One more song. One more song."""
01:57:34;01:57:37;"And then the whole crowd started going, ""One more song."""
01:57:37;01:57:39;"And then he came out, ""Rrrr."""
01:57:39;01:57:42;"And I was like, ""Oh my god, that's what you do?"""
01:57:42;01:57:46;"So you don't come out to just a bunch of people looking at you, ""What are you gonna play now?"""
01:57:46;01:57:51;"But what Kenny Chesney did, back to the topic, back to the earlier tangent."
01:57:51;01:57:56;"Kenny Chesney did a whole tour, and his encore was Joe Walsh."
01:57:56;01:58:00;"That was his encore. Five Joe Walsh songs, he did five."
01:58:00;01:58:03;"Joe Walsh didn't appear for the entire show."
01:58:03;01:58:10;"And then for the encore, Joe Walsh would come out and just do his smashes."
01:58:10;01:58:14;"Wait, and Kenny Chesney would sing with him, or Kenny Chesney would just hang backstage?"
01:58:14;01:58:17;"Oh yeah, he came out. No, he came out."
01:58:17;01:58:19;"They sang them together."
01:58:19;01:58:22;"They did them together, but I was like, ""What is going on?"""
01:58:22;01:58:26;"So Joe Walsh was on tour with him as a surprise guest every single night."
01:58:26;01:58:28;"That is the encore. Maybe it was just a couple weeks."
01:58:28;01:58:29;"That's amazing."
01:58:29;01:58:35;"I was like, ""That is how you--"" because everybody, maybe nobody in the audience knew who Joe Walsh was."
01:58:35;01:58:37;"Maybe, or half of them did."
01:58:37;01:58:38;"Yeah."
01:58:38;01:58:39;"But they knew every Joe Walsh song."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"They knew the songs, right."
01:58:40;01:58:45;"But then Kenny was telling-- apparently while they were on--"
01:58:45;01:58:52;"Kenny's telling this story about what he said, ""I used to come in from the audience."""
01:58:52;01:58:57;"This is not a great Kenny Chesney, but he said, ""I used to run in from the audience,"
01:58:57;01:59:03;"and the spotlights would be on me. I'd be running through the crowd, and I'd have security all around me."
01:59:03;01:59:09;"And this one time, this fellow just come over and just grabbed me around the waist and just picked me up"
01:59:09;01:59:11;"and held on real tight."
01:59:11;01:59:15;"And so I said, 'Put me down!' And I hit him. Wham!"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"And then he just gripped me tighter."
01:59:17;01:59:21;"And then I said, 'Put me down!' And I hit him again."""
01:59:21;01:59:26;"Well, it happened a few times, and then security got involved, and they pried him off of me,"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"and I got on the stage."
01:59:28;01:59:31;"And that's the last time I did the whole running up to the stage thing."
01:59:31;01:59:32;"I think I may have added that."
01:59:32;01:59:36;"Anyway, Joe Walsh was looking kind of like, ""Why'd you hit him?"""
01:59:36;01:59:37;"You know, kind of thing."
01:59:37;01:59:39;"Why'd you hit the guy?"
01:59:39;01:59:42;"Anyway, but he said, ""What would you have done, Joe?"""
01:59:42;01:59:48;"And Joe Walsh said, ""I'd asked him to carry me to the stage."""
01:59:48;01:59:53;"And I was just like, ""That's the difference between Joe Walsh. That's it."
01:59:53;01:59:56;"That's the difference between... What's the difference?"""
01:59:56;01:59:58;"But that'd be a good bumper sticker."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"""What's the difference between Joe Walsh?"""
02:00:00;02:00:03;"I just thought, ""I like Joe Walsh."""
02:00:03;02:00:08;"Anyway, I liked him more after seeing him do the encore on Kenny Chesney's tour."
02:00:08;02:00:11;"I thought, ""That's when you just say, 'F*** it.'"""
02:00:11;02:00:12;"That's a sick move."
02:00:12;02:00:13;"That's a sick move, isn't it?"
02:00:13;02:00:16;"Just surprised Joe Walsh said, ""That's awesome."""
02:00:16;02:00:18;"It was pretty f***ing great."
02:00:18;02:00:21;"That's f***ing good to end on Joe."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"Great place to end."
02:00:23;02:00:24;"Thank you so much."
02:00:24;02:00:27;"It's really been great talking to you."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"You're the man."
02:00:28;02:00:29;"Hope you come back sometime."
02:00:29;02:00:31;"I feel like we barely scratched the surface."
02:00:31;02:00:32;"Thanks for having me."
02:00:32;02:00:34;"It's nice to meet you."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Yeah, likewise."
02:00:35;02:00:37;"I hope..."
02:00:37;02:00:39;"Yeah, it's great to meet you guys."
02:00:39;02:00:41;"Maybe we'll see each other in the flesh."
02:00:41;02:00:42;"That'd be sick."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"I hope our paths cross."
02:00:43;02:00:45;"All right, truly, thanks so much for coming, man."
02:00:45;02:00:46;"That was awesome."
02:00:46;02:00:48;"Yeah, it was nice talking to you guys."
02:00:48;02:00:51;"That was an all-time TC guest."
02:00:51;02:00:52;"Love that energy."
02:00:52;02:00:53;"That was an all-timer."
02:00:53;02:00:57;"If he's willing, I could see us having him back many times in the future."
02:00:57;02:00:59;"A lot of good stories."
02:00:59;02:01:02;"Dave Matthews becoming a regular."
02:01:02;02:01:03;"But also just like..."
02:01:03;02:01:04;"Hornsby style, dude."
02:01:04;02:01:07;"Yeah, just like coming in another guy from Virginia."
02:01:07;02:01:08;"Yeah."
02:01:08;02:01:10;"He brought such great energy."
02:01:10;02:01:15;"Because I was wondering, did we prepare enough questions about his career and stuff?"
02:01:15;02:01:17;"And it's like, nah."
02:01:17;02:01:20;"He's talked about that stuff so many times."
02:01:20;02:01:22;"Yeah, yeah, totally."
02:01:22;02:01:23;"You know what?"
02:01:23;02:01:24;"We got to go catch a show."
02:01:24;02:01:25;"Yeah?"
02:01:25;02:01:26;"Let's do it."
02:01:26;02:01:27;"We got to catch a Dave show."
