00:00;00:09;"Time Crisis, back again. In this episode we talk music publishing, performance"
00:09;00:19;"rights, the year 1969, and HUMAN, the double album. We'll learn so much about"
00:19;00:30;"the music industry and the culture. This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:16;01:25;"Oh I'm snacking. Time Crisis back again. Sorry, I hope it's not too noisy. All right, I'll stop for now."
01:25;01:32;"Were you snacking on those leftover megabytes or what? I do have some megabytes left. I've given"
01:32;01:37;"them to my son for snacks a few times but I made the mistake of explaining to him in painstaking"
01:37;01:43;"TC detail initially that these were gold larger goldfish marketed to grown-ups. So sometimes when"
01:43;01:47;"he's asked for like a fun snack as children do I'll be like oh what about these and I'll be like"
01:47;01:53;"those are for grown-ups. Like come on man just eat the megabytes. Now I'm eating Asha Pops,"
01:53;02:00;"a real LA snack baked and handcrafted in LA. Popped water lily seeds. Wow I don't know what the"
02:00;02:07;"hell that is. You see them at all the Erewhon and all like the kind of bougie LA supermarkets but"
02:07;02:13;"they're good. They're popped water lily seeds. Asha and Jay are a mother and son team. Seems"
02:13;02:18;"of a South Asian descent and brought this snack to the US. All right. They do it together like that,"
02:18;02:24;"a family business and they're flavored and they're I don't know they're crunchy, they're good."
02:24;02:30;"Shout out to Asha Pops. I think it's a good snack. You don't see a lot of mother-son teams in the"
02:30;02:37;"snack industry. I feel like it's always brothers or father-son. Father-sons, maybe mother-daughters."
02:37;02:43;"Sure. Just a mom and a son teaming up to do business. Ezra. Yeah. I have to hold you to"
02:43;02:48;"account a little bit. I was about to hold you to account on this episode. I wonder what you're"
02:48;02:55;"about to say. Well I'm going to say did you drink any Folgers in the last two weeks? Oh god I don't"
02:55;02:59;"even remember what I said. I said I was going to drink it for the next two weeks. Yeah you felt"
02:59;03:04;"like you had been a little hard on them questioning their claim to New Orleans being their hometown"
03:04;03:10;"and you said you know what I'm going to drink some. Thanks for reminding me Jake. I'll do it"
03:10;03:15;"for next episode. All right. Not only did I forget about that the instant after we wrapped the"
03:15;03:21;"episode in the last couple weeks I even went more hipster with my coffee. Been buying some sort of"
03:21;03:27;"like glass jar cold brew concentrate which I think tastes good. I've just been drinking the concentrate"
03:27;03:33;"ice cold in the morning. I thought you were lukewarm on cold brew. Yeah. It's too strong"
03:33;03:39;"for you. It's not it was never that it was too strong. I like it strong. I just always I still"
03:39;03:45;"consider most cold brew to be what I call sour diesel and there's so many times where I'll get"
03:45;03:52;"a cold brew from a coffee shop and I'll say no no this is that sour diesel. I don't like it. Yeah."
03:52;03:57;"It's sour. It tastes weird. I don't know why this one brand I'm shouting out all these like little"
03:57;04:02;"brands today. I think it's called chameleon. I think there's a chameleon on the thing. It comes"
04:02;04:09;"in glass bottles and the concentrate it's not sour and I don't even like to dilute it. I like to drink"
04:09;04:13;"it. Gives me a nice clean high. A balanced brew it sounds like. You know what no are you getting"
04:13;04:21;"that at a Erewhon as well? And you're getting those popped water lily buds? You can get this all over."
04:21;04:26;"I order it sometimes. Yeah you would find this at an Erewhon type place. You might even find it at"
04:26;04:31;"a more mainstream supermarket now that everybody likes all the same stuff. But Jake can I hold you"
04:31;04:37;"to account? Sure. Did you get the first birthday present that I sent to your daughter? I don't"
04:37;04:43;"believe so. Okay maybe it never even showed up. Wait hold on what was it? Well this puts me in an"
04:43;04:48;"awkward position because either it never showed up or it got swiped from your porch but now I'd"
04:48;04:54;"have to if I describe it I'll lose the element of surprise that's important. Well when did you mail"
04:54;04:59;"it? Should have gotten to your house last week. I'm gonna feel like an ass if you say what it is"
04:59;05:06;"and I'm like oh yeah. This is so specific that you would probably think of me when it came."
05:06;05:13;"Was it not signed? Like there was no card? Man I don't know. What's the tracking number? Is there"
05:13;05:20;"a tracking number? Yes I need a number crunch. No no there's supposed to be a card. It was a"
05:20;05:28;"handmade crocheted plush toy. Do you remember receiving any handmade crocheted plush toys?"
05:28;05:37;"I don't think so. Oh man. Wait what did you send? It was a little stuffed crocheted forklift"
05:37;05:45;"for a small child to play with. A little forklift stuffy. Yeah I don't think we got that man."
05:45;05:49;"All right Seinfeld you have to do some real number crunching and some detective work."
05:49;05:55;"You know it's probably still on the way. Supply chain issues and whatnot. I wouldn't be surprised."
05:55;05:59;"I think it said that it was delivered but I'll tell you what this wouldn't be the first time"
05:59;06:06;"that I sent a baby gift and then I found out that it had been stolen. Can I throw this in the mix?"
06:06;06:11;"Yeah. It probably was delivered and it might have gotten opened without me being there."
06:11;06:17;"Very possible. And I'm not aware of it. I think that's probably the highest likelihood"
06:17;06:24;"is that it's in a pile of other stuffed animals and stuff and it's kind of lost in the mix."
06:24;06:30;"No I don't think it's possible because if it came if your daughter received a crocheted plush toy"
06:30;06:36;"forklift that'd instantly become her favorite toy. She'd be playing with it 24/7. There's"
06:36;06:41;"no way it would be thrown in a pile of other toys. That is true actually."

07:46;07:48;"I have a feeling it's there."
07:48;07:49;"- I hope so."
07:49;07:53;"There is an epidemic of box stealing."
07:53;07:55;"- We've had it happen once or twice."
07:55;07:57;"Not recently, knock on wood."
07:57;07:59;"- All right, well I'm praying that it's there."
07:59;08:02;"- That was a very kind of lightweight"
08:02;08:03;"holding each other to account."
08:03;08:05;"- Yeah."
08:05;08:07;"- Drink."
08:07;08:09;"- I'm glad that we both got something off our chest."
08:09;08:11;"- Hey man, I wanted to check in with you"
08:11;08:14;"about your New Year's resolution."
08:14;08:16;"You know, now that it's March,"
08:16;08:17;"I'm pretty sure you said you wanted"
08:17;08:19;"to drink more Folgers this year."
08:19;08:21;"Just wanted to make sure, you know,"
08:21;08:22;"are you actually doing it?"
08:22;08:24;"- Well, speaking of holding people to account,"
08:24;08:27;"Seinfeld, what's the latest with Chet?"
08:27;08:28;"- Oh, great question."
08:28;08:28;"- What is it called?"
08:28;08:29;"- Oh my goodness."
08:29;08:31;"- Hanks Fit, Fit Hanks."
08:31;08:36;"- Well, truthfully, I've maintained the nutritional regimen,"
08:37;08:39;"but I've been a little too busy"
08:39;08:42;"to keep up with the burpees is the truth."
08:42;08:46;"Which is to say that I have dropped a few pounds."
08:46;08:47;"- You look a slim."
08:47;08:51;"- Well, I mean, thank you and right back at ya."
08:51;08:55;"But, you know, the exercise has dropped off a little bit"
08:55;08:58;"due to the busy nature of my life at this current time."
08:58;09:03;"But I do think that Hanks' nutritional plan was a gift."
09:03;09:06;"I've been keeping up with it and I feel great."
09:06;09:07;"I feel lighter on my feet."
09:07;09:11;"So all is not lost and thanks for checking in."
09:11;09:13;"I think let's circle back in the summer."
09:13;09:15;"I might be going full Hanks Fit again,"
09:15;09:17;"but I am a little ashamed to admit that."
09:17;09:19;"But again, the fitness component,"
09:19;09:21;"which is one of the most important parts of it,"
09:21;09:22;"has slipped a little bit."
09:22;09:26;"- Now, but has he even hitting you up?"
09:26;09:26;"Wondering where you're at?"
09:26;09:29;"- Oh boy, well, now we're going a layer deeper"
09:29;09:33;"because I did inform him, you know,"
09:33;09:34;"here's what happened."
09:34;09:36;"I received an invoice."
09:36;09:38;"I said I wasn't able to keep up with, you know,"
09:38;09:41;"the exercise part of the plan and over text,"
09:41;09:44;"he did not make me feel especially great about that."
09:44;09:45;"And I deserved it."
09:45;09:47;"I'm not trying to shirk that at all,"
09:47;09:50;"but certainly he had a few words for me about, you know,"
09:50;09:52;"Twitter's never win, that sort of talk."
09:52;09:53;"And I did say to him, you know,"
09:53;09:54;"- Let's be clear."
09:54;09:55;"- Yeah."
09:55;09:56;"- He wasn't busting your (beep)"
09:56;10:00;"just because he was losing a paying client."
10:00;10:01;"- No."
10:01;10:03;"- He's gonna be absolutely fine without your money."
10:03;10:03;"- Oh, for sure."
10:03;10:04;"Yeah."
10:04;10:05;"- He wasn't busting your (beep)"
10:05;10:08;"because he was so just kind of let down"
10:08;10:11;"to see a fellow man not giving his all."
10:11;10:12;"- Yeah, I think that's about right."
10:12;10:16;"And you know, he, I think the writing was on the wall"
10:16;10:20;"because, you know, he has these weekend Zoom calls"
10:20;10:22;"and I wasn't showing up to those."
10:22;10:25;"So it couldn't have been a surprise when I dropped off,"
10:25;10:26;"but you're right."
10:26;10:29;"I think, you know, it's just, you know,"
10:29;10:30;"he was just let down in general,"
10:30;10:31;"not for losing the business,"
10:31;10:34;"but just for my sake, on my behalf."
10:34;10:36;"So yeah, you're right about that, but I'll be back."
10:36;10:38;"I'll be back in the Hanks Fit world."
10:38;10:39;"- Okay, glad to hear it."
10:39;10:41;"- We've really held each other to account here."
10:41;10:45;"(laughing)"
10:45;10:46;"- All right, glad we cleared the air."
10:46;10:48;"- Doing that mid-March check-in."
10:48;10:51;"- A lot of promises are made in the early months of a year."
10:51;10:54;"They often go by the wayside instantly."
10:54;10:56;"Well, you know what I wanna start with"
10:56;10:59;"because I feel like this has been on the docket for months."
10:59;11:02;"It's always getting punted because there's some hot news"
11:02;11:04;"like, you know, the jury sign fell."
11:04;11:08;"Pop-Tarts movie is, you know, going into production,"
11:08;11:10;"which by the way, you know, we were questioning"
11:10;11:12;"if perhaps that movie's not real."
11:12;11:15;"It was part of some sort of elaborate tax scam or something,"
11:15;11:17;"or we thought there was something kind of strange about it."
11:17;11:19;"But I was randomly talking to a musician friend,"
11:19;11:22;"I won't say who, 'cause this is their private business,"
11:22;11:24;"and I was like, just making small talks."
11:24;11:25;"""Did you hear about this Pop-Tarts movie?"""
11:25;11:28;"And he said, ""Oh yeah, I'm writing a song for it."""
11:28;11:30;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
11:30;11:33;"And they said, ""Oh yeah, I read the script."
11:33;11:34;"""It's gonna be great."""
11:34;11:36;"So, who knows?"
11:36;11:40;"- Is he writing like a jingle or like writing a song?"
11:40;11:42;"- Maybe it's like just a feel good,"
11:42;11:44;"like never give up on your dreams"
11:44;11:46;"kind of closing credits type song."
11:46;11:48;"I'll keep doing some research, but the movie is real, folks."
11:48;11:53;"- Commissioning an original song for the closing credits?"
11:53;11:54;"Amazing."
11:54;11:57;"- Jerry wants a hit soundtrack to the Pop-Tarts movie."
12:02;12:19;"- You wanna start with the catalogs."
12:19;12:21;"- But anyway, yes, the music catalogs,"
12:21;12:26;"because A, we did go pretty hard on the food last time."
12:26;12:27;"It's always gonna be part of time, Chris,"
12:27;12:29;"as we said, somewhat controversial,"
12:29;12:30;"but I thought we brought our A game."
12:30;12:32;"But look, at the end of the day,"
12:32;12:34;"we're also at least 50% of music show."
12:34;12:36;"And we've never, I don't think we've talked about this"
12:36;12:40;"too much on the show, but everybody's selling their catalogs."
12:40;12:43;"Maybe we talked about it with their publishing,"
12:43;12:45;"but a lot of people are selling their master recordings."
12:45;12:47;"And I think whenever the last time"
12:47;12:48;"we might've talked about it was,"
12:48;12:52;"so many of the heavy hitters have come through selling stuff."
12:52;12:53;"Bob Dylan sold it all."
12:53;12:56;"Bruce Springsteen sold it all."
12:56;12:58;"Neil Young sold it all."
12:58;13:00;"Yeah, it's big business."
13:00;13:01;"The numbers are staggering. - Paul Simon."
13:01;13:03;"- Oh yeah, Paul Simon. - David Bowie."
13:03;13:05;"- All the big ways. - Sting."
13:05;13:08;"- And then also as a music industry professional myself,"
13:08;13:10;"I'm also hearing about ones that maybe aren't making"
13:10;13:12;"the news, more of like a mid-career artist"
13:12;13:14;"who just decides to sell."
13:14;13:15;"This is happening as well."
13:15;13:17;"- Well, I'm seeing that Killers sold all releases"
13:17;13:22;"up to 2020 to Elridge Industries, price undisclosed."
13:22;13:24;"- Whoa, I didn't know about that one."
13:24;13:26;"- Killers. - Friends of the show, Killers."
13:26;13:27;"- Yeah, mid-career."
13:27;13:31;"I mean, they're the only ones on this list"
13:31;13:34;"that I'm looking at that seem to be sort of contemporary."
13:34;13:36;"- One interesting thing about it is,"
13:36;13:39;"for a lot of the big names, the number,"
13:39;13:40;"the price is in the news."
13:40;13:42;"So like Bob Dylan sold his entire publishing catalog"
13:42;13:44;"to Universal Music Publishing"
13:44;13:47;"for an estimated three to 400 million."
13:47;13:49;"And then he sold his master recordings to Sony"
13:49;13:51;"for another 200 million."
13:51;13:54;"So Bob Dylan just walking away with a cool 600 million"
13:54;13:56;"in the past year."
13:56;13:58;"- When it says he sold the master recordings,"
13:58;14:02;"he owned the recording of like Blonde on Blonde"
14:02;14:03;"and Blood on the Tracks and stuff?"
14:03;14:07;"Or were those still Columbia Records property, you think?"
14:07;14:09;"Or I don't know. - Well, that's a great question"
14:09;14:13;"because my understanding is that in the early to mid '60s,"
14:13;14:17;"it'd be highly unusual for an artist to sign a deal"
14:17;14:19;"where they had ownership of the masters."
14:19;14:20;"- Yeah."
14:20;14:21;"- And then obviously there's these famous stories"
14:21;14:25;"about the Beach Boys or somebody who sold"
14:25;14:29;"all of their early amazing work for barely anything"
14:29;14:31;"with like zero interest in it."
14:31;14:32;"So it would be unusual."
14:32;14:34;"So I don't know what the Bob Dylan story is,"
14:34;14:38;"but I will say sometimes you hear about these big names"
14:38;14:39;"who, when they made so much money,"
14:39;14:41;"they went back in the '70s or '80s"
14:41;14:43;"and bought their masters back,"
14:43;14:45;"or maybe it reverted to them at some point."
14:45;14:46;"So I don't know."
14:46;14:48;"I mean, if Sony gave him $200 million,"
14:48;14:51;"they must, there's no way they were just paying"
14:51;14:53;"for his '80s work."
14:53;14:54;"- Right."
14:54;14:56;"- As much as I love ""Joker Man,"""
14:56;14:58;"that's definitely a top five Bob song,"
14:58;15:03;"""Joker Man"" is not gonna be raking in the commercial money"
15:03;15:05;"the way that like a blowin' in the wind would."
15:05;15:07;"- I would think that the master recordings"
15:07;15:10;"would be worth more than the actual publishing,"
15:10;15:13;"but I don't know anything about this world really."
15:13;15:17;"'Cause I would figure you're gonna license the record."
15:17;15:19;"The song is great and you hear someone cover the song,"
15:19;15:20;"maybe it's good, maybe it's not,"
15:20;15:24;"but our cultural memory is attached to these recordings"
15:24;15:27;"of these songs from the '60s and '70s."
15:27;15:30;"And if you're gonna use that in a movie or an ad,"
15:30;15:34;"that's the most powerful realization of that."
15:34;15:36;"- Well, but in the case of a Bob Dylan,"
15:36;15:38;"he's written so many songs,"
15:38;15:41;"people have, on the really big Adele album,"
15:41;15:43;"there's a Bob Dylan cover."
15:43;15:43;"- What song?"
15:43;15:44;"- ""Sound of a Guy Got a Number Crunch,"""
15:44;15:48;"Adele covered ""Make You Feel My Love,"" is that right?"
15:48;15:49;"- That's correct."
15:49;15:50;"- What era is that from?"
15:50;15:53;"- Matt, can we get up ""Make You Feel My Love"" by Bob Dylan?"
15:53;15:55;"I believe that that is,"
15:55;15:59;"it's one of the favorite late period Bob songs."
15:59;16:02;"I think it's on ""Time Out of Mind,"""
16:02;16:05;"like a late '90s Bob kind of sweet ballad."
16:05;16:09;"- That's right, it's 1997 ""Time Out of Mind."""
16:09;16:12;"- Showing my ignorance of late period Bob."
16:12;16:13;"- Are you familiar with that album in particular,"
16:13;16:14;"""Time Out of Mind?"""
16:14;16:17;"- No, I've just been getting into ""Oh Mercy,"""
16:17;16:19;"which is from '89."
16:19;16:21;"I'm slowly working my way."
16:21;16:22;"- You're almost in the '90s."
16:22;16:24;"- I'm almost there."
16:24;16:25;"- This is interesting."
16:25;16:28;"It was first released commercially by Billy Joel"
16:28;16:30;"under the title to ""Make You Feel My Love"""
16:30;16:33;"before Dylan's version came out the same year."
16:33;16:34;"- Like Bob showed it to Billy Joel,"
16:34;16:36;"he's like, ""Hey, check this song out."""
16:36;16:37;"- It's mine now."
16:37;16:41;"♪ When the rain is blowing in your face ♪"
16:41;16:44;"- I have this memory of it, this album,"
16:44;16:49;"""Time Out of Mind"" being the last CD my parents ever bought."
16:49;16:50;"- That makes sense."
16:50;16:53;"- Like ""Tunnel of Love"" and ""Time Out of Mind"""
16:53;16:57;"feel like them trying to stay in the game."
16:57;16:59;"- Great grown-up albums."
16:59;17:02;"Yeah, but they're both great grown-up albums"
17:02;17:05;"by like iconic American artists"
17:05;17:07;"after their youthful periods."
17:07;17:09;"- Who just sold their catalogs."
17:09;17:11;"- And who are on Columbia Records."
17:11;17:14;"♪ And there is no one to energize your tears ♪"
17:14;17:16;"♪ I could hold you for a million years ♪"
17:16;17:19;"- So this really sounds like an Adele song."
17:19;17:21;"Although one of the opening lines"
17:21;17:24;"is about when the whole world is on your case."
17:24;17:26;"Play the Bob Dylan version."
17:26;17:30;"- Are you a fan of ""Time Out of Mind"", Ezra?"
17:30;17:33;"- You know, I've always been wanting to go deeper"
17:33;17:36;"because the Dylan heads love it."
17:36;17:37;"I've thrown it on here and there."
17:37;17:42;"This kind of sounds more like he's covering Adele."
17:42;17:44;"You know what I mean?"
17:44;17:48;"Couldn't you just hear like some headline just like,"
17:48;17:51;"weird Bob Dylan cover of Adele on his new record."
17:51;17:53;"And you like throw it on, it sounds like this."
17:53;17:55;"And you'd be like, all right."
17:55;17:56;"All right, Bob, interesting interpretation."
17:56;18:01;"♪ And the evening shatters and the stars appear ♪"
18:01;18:06;"♪ And there is no one there to dry your tears ♪"
18:06;18:13;"♪ I could hold you for a million years ♪"
18:13;18:15;"- But I guess just to go back to the publishing"
18:15;18:18;"versus the master distinction."
18:19;18:21;"Yeah, master recordings in the streaming era,"
18:21;18:24;"I think maybe are slightly more valuable."
18:24;18:26;"But in the case of like a Bob Dylan,"
18:26;18:31;"the fact that he wrote a song on Adele's gigantic album"
18:31;18:34;"was probably like the most money"
18:34;18:38;"one of his late period songs raked in by a mile."
18:38;18:42;"You know, so like Bob Dylan is like often covered"
18:42;18:44;"and you know, like there's that Rod Stewart,"
18:44;18:46;"Forever Young where he had,"
18:46;18:47;"he like realized he kind of ripped off Bob"
18:47;18:51;"and he gave him some publishing and so I don't know."
18:51;18:52;"Also in the case of Bob Dylan,"
18:52;18:53;"there's probably all this money coming in"
18:53;18:55;"from like weird surprising sources,"
18:55;18:59;"like blowing in the wind, being performed,"
18:59;19:01;"just the really old school stuff."
19:01;19:04;"- Adele claims to have quote, saved Bob Dylan"
19:04;19:06;"with the royalties earned from her single."
19:06;19:09;"Adele has claimed, this is in 2011."
19:09;19:12;"Adele has claimed that she quote, saved Bob Dylan"
19:12;19:15;"with the royalties he earned from her rendition"
19:15;19:16;"of ""Make You Feel My Love."""
19:16;19:17;"The singer believes that the track,"
19:17;19:20;"which is expected to chart at the top five on Sunday,"
19:20;19:24;"will earn Dylan over one million in the next few months."
19:24;19:28;"And it is his second favorite version after his own,"
19:28;19:29;"she told The Sun."
19:29;19:34;"- That's some classic Bob Dylan weird sense of humor."
19:34;19:36;"First of all, he's probably doing like a prank call."
19:36;19:40;"I mean, there's no way Bob Dylan was saved by $1 million."
19:40;19:43;"Many people would be saved by $1 million."
19:43;19:45;"I don't see Bob Dylan being that person,"
19:45;19:47;"but I can picture him just kind of like almost giggling"
19:47;19:51;"and like calling, he's like, ""Hello, is this Adele?"""
19:51;19:55;"She's like, ""Oh my God, Bob, Bob Dylan, what?"
19:55;19:57;"""Are you really calling me?"""
19:57;19:59;"And he's like, ""Yeah, I just wanted to say,"
19:59;20:01;"""thanks for covering that song."
20:01;20:03;"""Damn, I was about to go broke."
20:03;20:05;"""I needed that million real bad."
20:05;20:06;"""I was behind on my car payments."""
20:06;20:07;"(laughs)"
20:07;20:09;"And they'd be like, ""Oh, really?"""
20:09;20:12;"Like, ""Okay, yeah, man, they're about to come,"
20:12;20:14;"""they're about to come take my van."
20:14;20:17;"""Oh man, yeah, it was pretty dark."
20:17;20:19;"""Anyway, I just wanted to say great job."
20:19;20:22;"""It's my second favorite version of the song after mine."
20:22;20:23;"""Have a good one."""
20:23;20:26;"(laughs)"
20:26;20:30;"- You know, and just so she doesn't seem,"
20:30;20:32;"give it some context, so she doesn't seem like a maniac"
20:32;20:34;"either, 'cause you said, ""What do you mean saved?"""
20:34;20:36;"I think Adele's also pretty funny."
20:36;20:38;"She said, ""Look, someone told me the other day"
20:38;20:42;"""that I killed Bob Dylan with 'Make You Feel My Love.'"
20:42;20:44;"""I actually think I saved him."""
20:44;20:45;"- Oh, okay."
20:45;20:48;"- But then he said, and this is funny,"
20:48;20:50;"""I reckon with the amount it's been played on the radio,"
20:50;20:53;"""it's worth a lot to maybe he'll buy me a watch"
20:53;20:54;"""or something."""
20:54;20:56;"So I feel like she's being--"
20:56;20:57;"- Yeah, yeah."
20:57;20:59;"They probably had a very humorous discussion."
20:59;21:02;"Yeah, I mean, you know, in this day and age,"
21:02;21:05;"like back in the day, there were so many covers"
21:05;21:05;"all the time."
21:05;21:07;"Like people always say that yesterday,"
21:07;21:10;"the Beatles song has been like the most covered song ever."
21:10;21:12;"500 versions, and so--"
21:12;21:13;"- Right."
21:13;21:16;"- In this day and age, if you're like a huge songwriter,"
21:16;21:17;"it's kind of--"
21:17;21:18;"- I don't know though."
21:18;21:21;"Even with Dylan, I gotta say, like,"
21:21;21:23;"yeah, there's some iconic Dylan covers,"
21:23;21:24;"but the bulk of his stuff,"
21:24;21:26;"you remember the version that he did."
21:26;21:29;"I mean, someone might cover, you know,"
21:29;21:32;"""Desolation Row"" or something, but you're not gonna,"
21:32;21:36;"it's not gonna make the impact that his recording of it did."
21:36;21:39;"- Every time Vampire Weekend drops to ""Joker Man Live,"""
21:39;21:42;"ASCAP is paying Bob Dylan."
21:42;21:43;"- You save Bob Dylan."
21:43;21:44;"- We save Bob Dylan."
21:44;21:46;"I reckon with all the times we've covered ""Joker Man,"""
21:46;21:49;"he might've made three to $400."
21:49;21:50;"- For real?"
21:50;21:51;"- I don't know how it works,"
21:51;21:53;"but I really should know better."
21:53;21:55;"One day we'll do a whole-- - Who's paying him?"
21:55;21:58;"- Time crisis guide to the music industry,"
21:58;22:00;"'cause I'm a music industry professional."
22:00;22:01;"I've learned a thing or two."
22:01;22:04;"I probably don't know as much as I should."
22:04;22:07;"But so, you know, ASCAP is a collections agency."
22:07;22:07;"It's not the only one,"
22:07;22:09;"but it's kind of the most famous one."
22:09;22:10;"ASCAP."
22:10;22:12;"So it's a collections agency,"
22:12;22:14;"which means, as I understand it,"
22:14;22:18;"they're grabbing payments for music"
22:18;22:22;"that transcend the master publishing binary."
22:22;22:24;"I mean, it's kind of like publishing,"
22:24;22:27;"but there's little royalties that you might not think of"
22:27;22:28;"that somebody needs to collect"
22:28;22:32;"from like music played in bars or on digital jukeboxes."
22:32;22:34;"There's all this like random stuff,"
22:34;22:37;"and there is money, and I don't know."
22:37;22:38;"The music industry is so weird."
22:38;22:40;"Like sometimes I'll hear some story"
22:40;22:41;"where somebody's like,"
22:41;22:43;"I'll hear from like my management back in the day,"
22:43;22:46;"like, ""Oh yeah, we hired this agency in Europe."""
22:46;22:49;"'Cause you had a lot of royalties just like,"
22:49;22:51;"you know, sitting uncollected, you know,"
22:51;22:54;"like a few thousand bucks in Hungary,"
22:54;22:57;"500 euro in Lithuania."
22:57;22:59;"That was just sitting there."
22:59;23:00;"You're like, ""Wait, what?"""
23:00;23:02;"And they're like, ""Yeah, so you gotta hire it."
23:02;23:03;"An agency goes and gets it."
23:03;23:04;"Why do they do that?"""
23:04;23:06;"And it's like, ""Well, you know, they take a cut."
23:06;23:07;"That's how you get it."""
23:07;23:08;"It's weird."
23:08;23:09;"- But hold on."
23:09;23:12;"Let's back up to ""Vampire Weekend"" covering Joker, man."
23:12;23:13;"- Yes, okay."
23:13;23:16;"- So you literally think that ASCAP sent him a check?"
23:16;23:20;"Like, so ASCAP collected money from the venue or from you?"
23:20;23:21;"- From the venue."
23:21;23:25;"- So the venue reports the set lists to ASCAP?"
23:25;23:27;"- This part sounds crazy, but this is true."
23:27;23:28;"- This is mind-blowing."
23:28;23:31;"- ASCAP, a lot of restaurants, bars,"
23:31;23:34;"and particularly venues report to ASCAP."
23:34;23:37;"- Wait, restaurants and bars?"
23:37;23:39;"Like, if you're just playing music over the PA,"
23:39;23:42;"you have an Italian restaurant,"
23:42;23:44;"and it's very low volume."
23:44;23:47;"- And you're playing scenes from an Italian restaurant"
23:47;23:47;"at your Italian restaurant."
23:47;23:48;"- You're playing scenes from an Italian restaurant"
23:48;23:51;"at very low volume to the point where it's just more"
23:51;23:54;"of just kind of background ambient music."
23:54;23:57;"No one's even really there to listen to music."
23:57;24:01;"They're there to eat the pasta and the bread."
24:01;24:02;"- Have a bottle of red, drink a bottle of red."
24:02;24:04;"- Bottle of red, bottle of white."
24:04;24:07;"- Here's where I have to plead ignorance a little bit."
24:07;24:10;"I think you're right that not every single bar restaurant"
24:10;24:13;"in the US is paying ASCAP money"
24:13;24:15;"because there's some sort of cutoff."
24:15;24:18;"In fact, I mean, this is such an annoying number crunch,"
24:18;24:20;"but Seinfeld, Nick, you guys wanna like Google this"
24:20;24:22;"as I'm talking, maybe you can help me explain it."
24:22;24:25;"My understanding is that, for instance, with venues,"
24:25;24:27;"there's a certain threshold."
24:27;24:30;"I don't know if it has to do with different venues"
24:30;24:33;"have different deals, or if it has to do with the capacity,"
24:33;24:35;"'cause I could totally see that that ASCAP"
24:35;24:37;"maybe goes to arenas and says,"
24:37;24:39;"""Listen, you gotta do this by the books."
24:39;24:42;"""You gotta pay songwriters, but they're not gonna go"
24:42;24:47;"""to a punk house in Iowa City."""
24:47;24:50;"And just send some local person to be like,"
24:50;24:53;"""We heard a local hardcore band did an ironic cover"
24:53;24:57;"""of Hit Me Baby One More Time, pay up."""
24:57;24:58;"That's not happening."
24:58;25:00;"There's some sort of threshold, but truly,"
25:00;25:03;"I remember at a certain point when we were touring,"
25:03;25:04;"I don't know if the shows got big enough"
25:04;25:06;"or it was the venues we were playing,"
25:06;25:09;"our tour manager started to ask for the set list."
25:09;25:10;"And this is back in the day"
25:10;25:12;"when we didn't even change the set list."
25:12;25:13;"And I was like, ""Wait, why?"""
25:13;25:17;"And he'd be like, ""The venue needs it to report to ASCAP."""
25:17;25:20;"So I don't know if we got paid for playing our own songs,"
25:20;25:23;"or they need to see if there's a cover or something."
25:23;25:26;"Or maybe, for instance, let's say Madison Square Garden"
25:26;25:30;"maybe just pays a flat fee to ASCAP every year,"
25:30;25:32;"and then they look at all the music they played"
25:32;25:34;"over the loudspeakers, is it Nick's games,"
25:34;25:35;"and they look at all the songs that were covered,"
25:35;25:37;"and maybe they divide it up."
25:37;25:38;"And maybe if they're like,"
25:38;25:41;"""Oh, somebody came through and covered Joker Man,"""
25:41;25:44;"they're like, ""Well, that's five bucks for Bob."""
25:44;25:46;"I don't know how it works, but it's something like this."
25:46;25:49;"There's a whole alternate universe of royalties."
25:49;25:51;"- Did you cover Joker Man at MSG?"
25:51;25:53;"- No, as I was saying, and I realize that's a bad example,"
25:53;25:55;"'cause we did not cover Joker Man at MSG."
25:55;25:56;"We dropped--"
25:56;25:58;"- That would have been a baller."
25:58;26:03;"- We did a notable Joker Man in Indianapolis."
26:03;26:04;"- You did it at Webster Hall."
26:04;26:05;"- We did it at Webster Hall."
26:05;26:09;"So yeah, maybe Webster Hall pays ASCAP."
26:09;26:11;"Hopefully, enough of our listeners are the type of people"
26:11;26:13;"who are vaguely interested in the music industry,"
26:13;26:16;"but don't actually know how it works,"
26:16;26:19;"so that my vague rambling is somewhat interesting."
26:19;26:23;"But yes, there is random royalties"
26:23;26:25;"sitting there all over the world."
26:25;26:27;"Who knows, you might have some somewhere."
26:27;26:28;"- Well, I was gonna say, the big question is"
26:28;26:31;"all the times that Vampire Weekend covered Mountain Brews."
26:31;26:34;"- Wait, Jake, I'm dead-ass serious."
26:34;26:36;"'Cause we played Mountain Brews at Red Rocks."
26:36;26:38;"Red Rocks is exactly the type of venue,"
26:38;26:40;"because it's this iconic large venue,"
26:40;26:42;"that would be paying ASCAP."
26:42;26:45;"I would imagine that we submitted the set list"
26:45;26:48;"for night two at Red Rocks, and there could be,"
26:48;26:50;"you might need to talk to ASCAP, Jake."
26:50;26:51;"There could be--"
26:51;26:52;"- I need to hire one of those services"
26:52;26:54;"to go collect the Mountain Brews royalties."
26:54;26:57;"- You could have hundreds of dollars sitting in Hungary"
26:57;26:58;"right now with your name on it."
26:58;27:00;"- I think our friend Morgan Libas"
27:00;27:03;"really gets off on doing this sort of thing."
27:03;27:03;"- Oh, really?"
27:03;27:05;"Is this his purview? - Chasing down,"
27:05;27:06;"oh yeah, he'll chase down this money."
27:06;27:08;"- Should we try to get Morgan on the phone real quick?"
27:08;27:09;"- Oh my God, he'd be amazing."
27:09;27:11;"- We were gonna hire him,"
27:11;27:14;"Amanda was gonna hire him to chase down some money"
27:14;27:15;"that we thought might be owed"
27:15;27:18;"from some Capricorn stuff of her father's."
27:18;27:18;"He really-- - Wow."
27:18;27:21;"- We could get, yeah, so he's the kind of guy you hire."
27:21;27:22;"- You wanna call him right now?"
27:22;27:23;"Should we call him?"
27:23;27:25;"- I think he'd be really fun to talk to."
27:25;27:26;"- Let's call him."
27:26;27:28;"- While you wait for this, something I noticed,"
27:28;27:30;"because you definitely have to pay,"
27:30;27:32;"I mean, the bar has to pay ASCAP,"
27:32;27:34;"the restaurant theoretically has to."
27:34;27:37;"It's why when you go into Starbucks or a large chain,"
27:37;27:39;"it's always usually the same music or stuff"
27:39;27:42;"from CDs they put out because they have to pay this royalty."
27:42;27:45;"You can't just play whatever you want."
27:45;27:48;"Something I noticed recently is that in COVID,"
27:48;27:52;"when Amanda had to take a lot of her sort of,"
27:52;27:56;"you know, workout classes online over Zoom,"
27:56;27:58;"certain ones didn't wanna pay the ASCAP fee,"
27:58;28:00;"so they're just using really whack music."
28:00;28:02;"- Oh, right, see, that's a good example."
28:02;28:04;"- And so she's taking these classes"
28:04;28:06;"that normally if you're in a small space"
28:06;28:08;"and you're playing Megan Thee Stallion,"
28:08;28:10;"no one's gonna report you,"
28:10;28:12;"but if this is being sent out over a large Zoom,"
28:12;28:16;"so they're just using just really like library music."
28:16;28:19;"- I think there might've been a Peloton lawsuit already"
28:19;28:22;"because at first, you know, Peloton's using"
28:22;28:24;"some of the, you know, classic music."
28:24;28:26;"They're using the hits of today."
28:26;28:27;"They're doing Grateful Dead rides."
28:27;28:29;"They're using all the great music."
28:29;28:32;"And I think the music industry or some of these agencies"
28:32;28:35;"had to negotiate with them because at a certain point,"
28:35;28:39;"yeah, like of course, if you go just to your local gym"
28:39;28:41;"and they're playing some music,"
28:41;28:43;"who knows if they're paying anything,"
28:43;28:46;"but when you're Peloton, that's kind of like a TV show."
28:46;28:49;"When you got like 20, 30,000 people tuning in,"
28:49;28:52;"that's more people than watch a lot of TV shows these days."
28:52;28:54;"So like, yeah, it creates this thing."
28:54;28:56;"And anyway, I gotta say with all this stuff,"
28:56;28:58;"as I understand it,"
28:58;29:00;"just 'cause you hear a song at a supermarket,"
29:00;29:02;"that doesn't mean that that person's getting like super paid."
29:02;29:04;"They might be getting paid 5 cents,"
29:04;29:06;"but in the case of a Bob Dylan,"
29:06;29:09;"just when you imagine how big his catalog is,"
29:09;29:12;"when you start to like scale that up"
29:12;29:14;"and you're like at any given moment,"
29:14;29:16;"somewhere in the world, there's like a Bob Dylan song"
29:16;29:18;"playing somewhere, somebody's covering it."
29:18;29:21;"Maybe there's a mega church that, you know,"
29:21;29:24;"broadcast to millions of people and they have, you know,"
29:24;29:27;"30,000 people come to that mega church every Sunday"
29:27;29:29;"and they do a special,"
29:29;29:32;"♪ I shall be released ♪"
29:32;29:34;"They bring somebody out to do, ""I shall be released,"""
29:34;29:37;"or ""You gotta serve somebody"" from his Christian period."
29:37;29:38;"There's just all these like funny ways."
29:38;29:41;"So when you get to a Bob Dylan level,"
29:41;29:43;"that could really get substantial"
29:43;29:45;"because he has thousands of songs."
29:45;29:46;"But yeah, I've always kind of wanted"
29:46;29:48;"to understand this a little better."
29:48;29:50;"If there's anybody listening from ASCAP,"
29:50;29:53;"you can call the show and explain this to us."
29:53;29:55;"- And it looks like a typical restaurant, for example,"
29:55;29:57;"it's a couple hundred dollars probably"
29:57;30:00;"to pay whatever ASCAP fee to play music."
30:00;30:03;"But if you are caught, the penalty is anywhere"
30:03;30:07;"between a thousand to $30,000."
30:07;30:10;"- So ASCAP has like agents."
30:10;30:13;"- The owner of the new smoothie and grain bowls place"
30:13;30:17;"was renditioned by ASCAP private security"
30:17;30:20;"after failing to pay the yearly fee."
30:20;30:23;"- We just found out that a few years ago at least,"
30:23;30:28;"the ASCAP fee for a restaurant is about $380."
30:28;30:30;"- So that's any restaurant?"
30:30;30:31;"- But that's the year. - Any restaurant in America?"
30:31;30:36;"- Yeah, any restaurant in America is supposed to pay $380,"
30:36;30:37;"which I can't tell here,"
30:37;30:40;"but I guess it's like allows you"
30:40;30:42;"to play any music that you want."
30:42;30:44;"Seems like a pretty small fee given the penalty."
30:44;30:46;"- You know there's some kind of vibe coffee shops"
30:46;30:49;"that have mountain brews on rotation."
30:49;30:51;"We've got to get Jake his money."
30:53;31:06;"♪ Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike ♪"
31:06;31:12;"♪ Meet in the trailhead light around a quarter to three ♪"

31:54;31:57;"- Jake, I bet you have at least thousands of dollars"
31:57;32:00;"sitting uncollected across the globe."
32:00;32:03;"- And it would cost me thousands to retrieve it."
32:03;32:05;"- Yeah, you're going to be in the hole about 10K"
32:05;32:06;"if you try to get it."
32:06;32:08;"(laughing)"
32:08;32:11;"- That's where a guy like Morgan comes in"
32:11;32:14;"because he does it for free."
32:14;32:16;"If he sees the money."
32:16;32:18;"- Cash only."
32:18;32:19;"- Morgan's never doing God's work."
32:19;32:21;"He's doing it because he sees the money."
32:21;32:23;"He's like, I'm going to get myself a cut of that."
32:23;32:27;"So if he goes, oh, that mountain brews, I see a paycheck."
32:27;32:30;"- Right, I'll get Jake 2,500 bucks"
32:30;32:32;"and a little 500 for my troubles."
32:32;32:33;"Pretty good."
32:33;32:34;"- I'll take that deal."
32:34;32:36;"- I mean, the whole reason we were talking about catalogs"
32:36;32:39;"is because apparently Motley Crue sold"
32:39;32:42;"their entire recorded music catalog to BMG"
32:42;32:44;"for an estimated 150 million."
32:44;32:47;"And I know this ever since you heard about this, Jake,"
32:47;32:49;"this has just blown your mind."
32:49;32:52;"How could Motley Crue's, you're on record on the show"
32:52;32:54;"saying that you don't respect Motley Crue's music"
32:54;32:56;"or catalog at all."
32:56;32:57;"- Well, it just doesn't track."
32:57;33:00;"I mean, 150 million is a lot of money."
33:00;33:03;"- Stevie Nicks sold a majority stake in her songs"
33:03;33:06;"to Primary Wave for 100 million."
33:06;33:09;"Neil Young sold 50% of his catalog"
33:09;33:11;"for an estimated 150 million."
33:11;33:15;"- So if Neil Young sold half his catalog for 150,"
33:15;33:18;"I guess we can say that means his catalog is worth 300."
33:18;33:21;"Is there any universe in which Motley Crue's catalog"
33:21;33:23;"is worth 50% of Neil Young's?"
33:23;33:24;"- No."
33:24;33:25;"- Yeah, if you asked me to spitball,"
33:25;33:28;"I would guess their catalog would be worth 10% of Neil Young's"
33:28;33:29;"- Precisely."
33:29;33:31;"- And of course at their peak, they were huge,"
33:31;33:34;"but it's like, I never hear Motley Crue anywhere."
33:34;33:38;"- No, we remember Motley Crue because of their image,"
33:38;33:42;"because of Tommy Lee and Tam and Pommy."
33:42;33:43;"- Tam and Pommy."
33:43;33:45;"(laughing)"
33:45;33:46;"- Tam and Paula."
33:46;33:50;"- No, we remember Motley Crue as icons of the '80s,"
33:50;33:52;"but their actual music,"
33:52;33:54;"and I don't know, does that translate?"
33:54;33:58;"Just them being sort of iconic '80s guys."
33:58;34:01;"- No, and you pull some 14-year-olds off the street"
34:01;34:04;"of rock bands, yeah, they might know one AC/DC song,"
34:04;34:05;"one Rolling Stones song."
34:05;34:07;"I think they're not gonna know any Motley Crue songs."
34:07;34:08;"- No."
34:08;34:10;"- No way, we're not pulling an Eddie Vedder here."
34:10;34:11;"We respect Motley Crue's artistry,"
34:11;34:14;"we're not trying to (beep) on them."
34:14;34:15;"I'm just saying that they--"
34:15;34:16;"- It doesn't matter what I think"
34:16;34:18;"about Motley Crue personally."
34:18;34:21;"I'm just saying the numbers, like they have a great lawyer."
34:21;34:22;"That's what I'll say."
34:22;34:23;"- I'll tell you one thing about these people"
34:23;34:25;"who buy catalogs."
34:25;34:27;"There's big money behind this."
34:27;34:28;"The people investing in these companies"
34:28;34:30;"that are buying up all the publishing,"
34:30;34:31;"these are billionaires."
34:31;34:36;"These are, you know, the JP Morgans, the Black Rocks."
34:36;34:38;"These are serious business people."
34:38;34:40;"They're cracking open the books saying,"
34:40;34:42;"hey, Neil Young's manager,"
34:42;34:44;"how much did Neil's catalog make last year?"
34:44;34:45;"I wanna see everything."
34:45;34:47;"I'll give you 25 times that."
34:47;34:48;"- Right. - Or maybe with Neil Young"
34:48;34:49;"because he's so prestigious,"
34:49;34:51;"they'll say I'll give you 40 times,"
34:51;34:53;"you know, they'll really butt it up."
34:53;34:56;"But I've always had this explained to me as like multiples"
34:56;34:59;"where they're like, they look at how much you make in a year"
34:59;35:01;"and they say, here's a check up front"
35:01;35:04;"for your next 30 years of earnings, but now it's mine."
35:04;35:05;"Like they're looking hard at this."
35:05;35:09;"I don't see Motley Crue getting like a deal."
35:09;35:12;"So I think we have to confront the cold hard fact"
35:12;35:16;"that Motley Crue is way more popular in 2022"
35:16;35:18;"than we understand."
35:18;35:20;"People are enjoying their music."
35:20;35:21;"They're playing it."
35:21;35:23;"- And they're confident that Motley Crue"
35:23;35:25;"will be a true legacy artist"
35:25;35:28;"whose music will be enjoyed in 10, 20, 30 years."
35:28;35:29;"- Oh yeah."
35:29;35:31;"- Also think about international."
35:31;35:33;"Think about like, you know, Malaysia."
35:33;35:34;"Think about, you know, Latvia."
35:34;35:37;"You know, they might be a lot bigger"
35:37;35:38;"on some of those places."
35:38;35:40;"They might still be very relevant."
35:40;35:42;"Also just to put this in context,"
35:42;35:46;"Imagine Dragons sold their catalog a couple of years ago,"
35:46;35:47;"a hundred million."
35:47;35:48;"- And that's early."
35:48;35:50;"So that's only for like a few albums."
35:50;35:51;"- Honestly, I feel like Imagine Dragons"
35:51;35:53;"have more hits than Motley Crue."
35:53;35:54;"- Okay."
35:54;35:56;"- He's the one that go, Dr. Feel Good."
35:56;35:59;"He's the one that make you feel all right."
35:59;36:01;"All right, Jake, which is a better band,"
36:01;36:03;"Imagine Dragons or Motley Crue?"
36:03;36:05;"- Well, I'm a sucker for power ballads."
36:05;36:07;"So I'm gonna go Motley Crue"
36:07;36:08;"'cause they got Without You"
36:08;36:10;"and they got Home Sweet Home."
36:10;36:12;"- Okay, but what about Radioactive?"
36:12;36:14;"- Is that a Imagine Dragons power ballad?"
36:14;36:16;"- Power ballad?"
36:16;36:17;"- I'm really not trying to go veter here,"
36:17;36:20;"but Imagine Dragons is way better."
36:20;36:21;"- Wow."
36:21;36:23;"- They're more formally innovative than Motley Crue."
36:23;36:25;"- Well, Imagine Dragons, I also respect them"
36:25;36:27;"'cause I feel like they're just like out there on their own."
36:27;36:29;"They're like the biggest band in the world."
36:29;36:32;"I mean, I've defended Imagine Dragons many times."
36:32;36:34;"Not that they need my defense."
36:34;36:38;"They're sitting at $100 million plus,"
36:38;36:40;"but back in the day when some people"
36:40;36:43;"were popping off, dissing them,"
36:43;36:44;"we always took Imagine Dragons' side."
36:44;36:46;"But I'll say, yeah, Imagine Dragons are weird"
36:46;36:47;"because they're like, to me,"
36:47;36:49;"they're like the only band like them."
36:49;36:53;"They exist in this weird space between pop and rock."
36:53;36:55;"They're just like doing their own thing."
36:55;36:58;"With Motley Crue, they're so clearly part of this wave."
36:58;36:59;"So I think the tough part,"
36:59;37:01;"and I know you feel this way, Jake,"
37:01;37:02;"when we've talked about them in the past,"
37:02;37:04;"it's like you instantly just start comparing them"
37:04;37:08;"to like Def Leppard and these bands"
37:08;37:10;"that just have these like Guns N' Roses,"
37:10;37:13;"these bands, just like these other '80s rock/metal bands"
37:13;37:16;"that just kind of have superior songwriting."
37:16;37:18;"But that said, I think Motley Crue has--"
37:18;37:20;"- Motley Crue has four albums"
37:20;37:23;"that have gone four times platinum."
37:23;37:24;"- Motley Crue?"
37:24;37:25;"- Yeah."
37:25;37:27;"- Yeah, look, they did their thing."
37:27;37:29;"They've sold a lot of records."
37:29;37:31;"They don't have the catalog."
37:31;37:34;"I'm saying their cultural legacy is pure image,"
37:34;37:36;"and I don't understand the value of their music"
37:36;37:41;"going forward as their image fades into the ether."
37:41;37:42;"I just don't--"
37:42;37:45;"- Well, look, Pam and Tommy, they're back in the news."
37:45;37:47;"- Was there any Motley Crue in that show?"
37:47;37:48;"I don't think so."
37:48;37:50;"- No, but that-- - The Dirt, which you--"
37:50;37:50;"- The Dirt."
37:50;37:51;"- I love The Dirt."
37:51;37:56;"- Was a top 10 album in 2019, the Dirt soundtrack."
37:56;37:57;"They're a legacy band."
37:57;37:59;"- Three years ago, Motley Crue was doing"
37:59;38:01;"some serious damage on the charts."
38:01;38:04;"Jake, you're living in your coastal liberal elite bubble"
38:04;38:08;"where Motley Crue is not a major heritage act,"
38:08;38:11;"but newsflash, you drive a few miles"
38:11;38:15;"outside of Los Angeles, people are blasting Crue"
38:15;38:17;"like 24/7."
38:17;38:20;"- Motley Crue is worth half of what Neil Young is."
38:20;38:24;"- Right, and think about international too, right?"
38:24;38:26;"South Africa, Korea."
38:26;38:29;"- No, I feel you, Seinfeld, and it is true."
38:29;38:33;"It's like Tommy Lee is probably more recognizable"
38:33;38:35;"to more people than Neil Young."
38:35;38:37;"Again, I don't know how that translates"
38:37;38:38;"to money from actual music."
38:38;38:41;"- Certainly more people are familiar with his whole body"
38:41;38:43;"than Neil Young."
38:43;38:43;"There you go."
38:43;38:45;"- I wonder if Methods of Mayhem,"
38:45;38:46;"do you think that's part of that deal"
38:46;38:48;"or do you think that was just like,"
38:48;38:49;"Tommy keeps that--"
38:49;38:52;"- We'll throw in Methods of Mayhem."
38:52;38:53;"- We'll throw in Get Naked."
38:53;38:57;"- Listen, there's probably, outside of our world,"
38:57;38:59;"there's probably an internet radio show,"
38:59;39:01;"some other country, some other place,"
39:01;39:03;"where a bunch of people are looking at the same numbers"
39:03;39:04;"as us and they're like,"
39:04;39:07;"you're telling me Neil Young sold his catalog"
39:07;39:09;"for more than Motley Crue?"
39:09;39:11;"Like, whoa, who the (beep) listens"
39:11;39:13;"to that old hippie (beep) anymore?"
39:13;39:13;"What?"
39:13;39:15;"- I could totally see that."
39:15;39:18;"I mean, I'm totally bringing my subjective"
39:18;39:21;"coastal elite taste to this, no doubt about it."
39:21;39:22;"I'll own that."
39:22;39:24;"I mean, I guess all of it's a little crazy."
39:24;39:26;"I wonder if they're over, I mean,"
39:26;39:30;"like if they're making a long-term investment in this music,"
39:30;39:33;"I don't think any of it is a sure bet, you know?"
39:33;39:35;"I mean, it's like, what will Neil Young's music"
39:35;39:38;"be worth in 15 years?"
39:38;39:40;"Who can possibly say?"
39:40;39:42;"It's only gonna get less and less valuable"
39:42;39:44;"with every year, I would think."
39:44;39:49;"♪ My, my, hey, hey ♪"
39:51;39:56;"♪ Rock and roll is here to stay ♪"
39:56;40:04;"♪ It's better to burn out than to fade away ♪"
40:04;40:10;"♪ My, my, hey, hey ♪"
40:10;40:13;"- What's interesting about this too is that,"
40:13;40:15;"so again, like my understanding of what I was saying"
40:15;40:17;"about Motley Crue, that I don't see this"
40:17;40:20;"as their lawyer finessing somebody who's just like,"
40:20;40:22;"okay, you really think it's a good investment?"
40:22;40:23;"The guy's like, oh, absolutely."
40:23;40:25;"I really think when people do these deals,"
40:25;40:27;"they're cracking open the books."
40:27;40:29;"These are hardcore businessmen."
40:29;40:31;"These are not like some pie in the sky,"
40:31;40:35;"like fun, weird label guy who's like,"
40:35;40:37;"you know what, (beep) it, I'll sign you."
40:37;40:38;"I'll sign you for $10 million."
40:38;40:40;"It's not like that kind of thing."
40:40;40:42;"I think it really is pencil pushers"
40:42;40:43;"who are looking at these numbers."
40:43;40:46;"So what I think all of this says,"
40:46;40:49;"'cause whether you're a Neil Young person"
40:49;40:51;"or a Motley Crue person, and I know a lot more of you"
40:51;40:55;"are probably Motley Crue people, statistically speaking,"
40:55;40:58;"what all of this reflects is that the marketplace,"
40:58;41:02;"the street, Wall Street, international capital,"
41:02;41:05;"really believes that people will be listening"
41:05;41:09;"to this 20th century music for the next 100 years."
41:09;41:11;"The street has spoken."
41:11;41:14;"They believe that this is a good, good long-term investment."
41:14;41:17;"It's also one of the stories like, you plant a tree"
41:17;41:19;"for the next generation to enjoy its shade."
41:19;41:21;"The people buying this stuff now,"
41:21;41:24;"they'll probably be dead"
41:24;41:26;"before their investment turns a profit,"
41:26;41:29;"but at a certain point, it'll just be like,"
41:29;41:30;"the faucet will be going."
41:30;41:33;"Once they recoup whatever they paid for all this stuff,"
41:33;41:36;"then it's gonna be just pure money coming in"
41:36;41:37;"to their children and grandchildren."
41:37;41:39;"- Guys, I just got a text. - Not Bob Dylan's."
41:39;41:42;"- Yeah. - That Morgan's available."
41:42;41:43;"- Okay. - So we should give him a call."
41:43;41:47;"- So to your point of the value, the market value of this,"
41:47;41:49;"I have this memory of talking to Morgan"
41:49;41:52;"about the catalog publishing stuff,"
41:52;41:56;"and I feel that it's like the deluxe lifestyle thing."
41:56;41:59;"Like a catalog is like a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle,"
41:59;42:02;"is that there's something about the tangibility,"
42:02;42:03;"like that you know that you have this thing,"
42:03;42:07;"and the more it ages, that you own something,"
42:07;42:10;"or the watches that we talked about, the vintage cars,"
42:10;42:14;"that whoever owns this, it's never gonna lose value,"
42:14;42:18;"because it's from a time where someone crafted something,"
42:18;42:23;"and that moving forward in a SoundCloud universe,"
42:23;42:25;"or streaming universe, there just won't be as much value."
42:25;42:29;"So if you can get these big heritage catalogs"
42:29;42:31;"that has a similar value."
42:31;42:32;"- But it's still a bet,"
42:32;42:35;"because you always read these stories where somebody's like,"
42:35;42:39;"this person was like the most famous songwriter of like 1905."
42:39;42:42;"We don't know a single one of their songs today,"
42:42;42:43;"but you know, that was a different era, maybe."
42:43;42:45;"Also now these, the people buying these"
42:45;42:48;"are incentivized to keep the fire burning."
42:48;42:50;"We're not gonna let Motley Crue fall off."
42:50;42:53;"All of Wall Street is now invested in Motley Crue"
42:53;42:56;"becoming the iconic band of the 80s."
42:56;42:57;"- What about public domain though?"
42:57;42:59;"Isn't there a certain statute where,"
42:59;43:03;"you know, after, what is it, 125 years, 100 years,"
43:03;43:05;"anyone can do it, whatever they want?"
43:05;43:07;"- That's a great question actually."
43:07;43:08;"That wouldn't be true for the master,"
43:08;43:10;"because I think they could always own it."
43:10;43:12;"- Well, they're probably also betting"
43:12;43:13;"that the laws will keep changing."
43:13;43:14;"- Right."
43:14;43:16;"- They keep extending the length"
43:16;43:19;"until it becomes public domain."
43:19;43:21;"- I like this universe where this huge hedge fund,"
43:21;43:26;"VC firm owns this, and they also own all of McDonald's."
43:26;43:30;"And so they're just pushing every,"
43:30;43:32;"it's like, we gotta keep pushing Motley Crue."
43:32;43:33;"- Right. - Every commercial."
43:33;43:37;"- One giant equity firm owns Motley Crue and McDonald's,"
43:37;43:39;"another one owns Poison and Burger King."
43:39;43:42;"It becomes this like weird proxy war."
43:42;43:44;"We're like, yeah, it's funny."
43:44;43:47;"Like Burger King is really pushing the,"
43:47;43:53;"the new six part Poison prestige TV drama."
43:53;43:54;"It's weird."
43:54;43:55;"What like, what does that have to do"
43:55;43:56;"with the Burger King Kids Club?"
43:56;43:57;"And it's like, oh yeah. - I mean, it makes no sense."
43:57;44:00;"Burger King just keeps using Unskinny Bop in every ad."
44:00;44:01;"(laughing)"
44:01;44:03;"- That makes no sense."
44:03;44:05;"- There's a Burger King poison meal."
44:05;44:07;"(laughing)"
44:07;44:09;"- Somehow it becomes like some weird,"
44:09;44:13;"like it's actually like a Chinese equity firm"
44:13;44:15;"bought the Poison catalog"
44:15;44:19;"and an American one owns Motley Crue."
44:19;44:22;"And then like somehow some like conflict"
44:22;44:25;"in the South China Sea, they fly Vince Neil out."
44:25;44:27;"You're like, how come so much of geopolitics"
44:27;44:30;"seems to revolve around these 80s hair metal bands?"
44:30;44:32;"And you're like, listen man. - Vince Neil's like 70."
44:32;44:34;"(laughing)"
44:34;44:36;"- Vince Neil's out there, man."
44:36;44:37;"(laughing)"

45:27;45:29;"- All right, let's get Morgan on the phone."
45:29;45:32;"I've known him for years and he works in music publishing."
45:32;45:36;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
45:36;45:38;"(phone ringing)"
45:38;45:41;"- Hi Ezra."
45:41;45:42;"- Hi Jake."
45:42;45:43;"- What's up Morgan?"
45:43;45:45;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
45:45;45:46;"Pleasure to have you on the show."
45:46;45:48;"All right, so you're a music publisher."
45:48;45:50;"I think we more or less know what music publishing is."
45:50;45:51;"It's like songwriting."
45:51;45:56;"But now, ASCAP, what does ASCAP do?"
45:56;45:57;"Are they a music publisher too?"
45:57;45:58;"They collect royalties,"
45:58;46:00;"but a different type of royalties, right?"
46:00;46:03;"ASCAP is a performing rights organization."
46:03;46:08;"So in America, their equivalent is BMI."
46:08;46:12;"And so what they're collecting on behalf of songwriters,"
46:12;46:16;"and if a songwriter has a publisher,"
46:16;46:18;"then they're collecting the publisher share."
46:18;46:20;"I'll differentiate that in a second."
46:20;46:25;"But what they're after is public performance income."
46:25;46:28;"This would be like radio airplay."
46:28;46:30;"You have a song that plays on the radio,"
46:30;46:33;"you have the song that plays at the DSPs,"
46:33;46:35;"the digital service providers."
46:35;46:37;"You have a song that plays on television,"
46:37;46:39;"whether that's a synchronization"
46:39;46:44;"with inside of a TV show, Netflix,"
46:44;46:46;"all of those, Hulu, everything."
46:46;46:50;"Pretty much, so long as it's not a buyout."
46:50;46:53;"And sometimes licensees will do a buyout,"
46:53;46:55;"like a Netflix will prefer to pay"
46:55;46:57;"a little bit more money for a license."
46:57;46:59;"This has kind of gotten swatted away by the industry."
46:59;47:01;"- Well, hold on, let me get a little more specific,"
47:01;47:02;"just 'cause I think the listeners,"
47:02;47:04;"they probably have a vague sense"
47:04;47:07;"that you have music on TV, music on Netflix,"
47:07;47:08;"you're getting paid."
47:08;47:11;"I think what is more surprising to people"
47:11;47:13;"is that people are getting paid"
47:13;47:15;"when their music plays in a restaurant"
47:15;47:18;"or when it's covered in a live concert."
47:18;47:19;"- Okay."
47:19;47:21;"- The example that we were talking about"
47:21;47:25;"was ""Vampire Weekend"" covering ""Joker Man"" by Bob Dylan."
47:25;47:26;"- No, no, but let's get even more specific."
47:26;47:27;"Morgan, you might not know this,"
47:27;47:31;"but ""Vampire Weekend,"" our second night at Red Rocks in 2019,"
47:31;47:34;"we covered Jake's song ""Mountain Bruce."""
47:34;47:36;"Does Jake get a little taste of that?"
47:36;47:37;"- Great question."
47:37;47:40;"So if Jake was to get a taste of that,"
47:40;47:43;"you would have submitted a set list."
47:43;47:44;"- And I believe we did."
47:44;47:46;"- So if you did, then Jake, theoretically,"
47:46;47:48;"there'd be a little cash on the vine."
47:48;47:50;"Now again, we're talking about a nickels"
47:50;47:51;"and dimes space of publishing,"
47:51;47:54;"but it's where a PRO is super important, because again--"
47:54;47:58;"- Is it like literally a nickel or like $10?"
47:58;48:01;"- My guesstimation would be you getting your song covered"
48:01;48:04;"at Red Rocks might be somewhere between a nickel and 10 bucks."
48:04;48:05;"(laughing)"
48:05;48:07;"- Somewhere in that."
48:07;48:08;"Listen, Morgan, Jake's planning his future here."
48:08;48:09;"You need to get a little--"
48:09;48:10;"- So Morgan, you need to do some digging."
48:10;48:15;"- Morgan, if I wanted to hire you to collect that royalty"
48:15;48:18;"that I'm owed out of Red Rocks,"
48:18;48:23;"where is that $7.20 sitting and how would I get it?"
48:23;48:25;"- Every songwriter wants to affiliate"
48:25;48:27;"with a performing rights organization."
48:27;48:28;"That's the first step."
48:28;48:31;"Any publisher that sort of presents themselves"
48:31;48:35;"as being a person who provides that service,"
48:35;48:37;"well, you know, great, terrific,"
48:37;48:41;"but really it's a very easy process to affiliate with a PRO."
48:41;48:42;"And as a songwriter,"
48:42;48:44;"you should just take that on board yourself."
48:44;48:47;"And when doing it, I think it's really important"
48:47;48:49;"that you create a publishing designee."
48:49;48:51;"A lot of times as a publisher,"
48:51;48:53;"we go and we look at a song,"
48:53;48:57;"we look for a songwriter and we see no publishing designee."
48:57;48:59;"We just see the songwriter."
48:59;49:03;"This is like on ASCAP.com, BMI.com"
49:03;49:06;"on their public forward-facing repertoire search."
49:06;49:09;"And when you don't see a pub designee,"
49:09;49:12;"that means BMI and ASCAP pass the publisher's share"
49:12;49:15;"directly across to the writer, which is fine."
49:15;49:17;"You don't lose any money that way,"
49:17;49:20;"but it's really good to have a pub designee"
49:20;49:23;"because then what happens is you kind of get two checks."
49:23;49:25;"You get a writer's share check and a publisher's share check."
49:25;49:27;"- It sounds like Jake's getting no checks"
49:27;49:30;"because he has no relationship with ASCAP or BMI"
49:30;49:32;"or any kind of PRO. - Well, I might have one."
49:32;49:33;"He wants, yeah, so we--"
49:33;49:35;"- Morgan, don't you have a special website"
49:35;49:37;"you could look up like how much money is sitting around"
49:37;49:39;"for different songwriters?"
49:39;49:42;"- No, if we had that, you know, that would be fantastic."
49:42;49:43;"But no, that doesn't exist."
49:43;49:45;"- So you can't do a quick number crunch"
49:45;49:47;"to tell me how much money Jake's leaving on the table"
49:47;49:49;"for Mountain Bruce? - No, I can't."
49:49;49:52;"But what I can't, but the way that we would work backwards"
49:52;49:56;"would be, and again, it's really hard right now to pin,"
49:56;49:58;"for instance, if you have, you know,"
49:58;50:00;"a million streams on a song."
50:00;50:03;"Let's also assume you had 100% of the song, right?"
50:03;50:05;"That's a very important factor."
50:05;50:07;"- Are you the sole songwriter of Mountain Bruce?"
50:07;50:09;"- No, I credit everyone."
50:09;50:12;"- Got it, so we're splitting the nickels."
50:12;50:13;"- Well, actually, Mountain Bruce might be just me."
50:13;50:16;"Everything later was everyone."
50:16;50:18;"- Well, but also Jake-- - It doesn't matter."
50:18;50:19;"- Well, Jake and I have had this kind of conversation--"
50:19;50:22;"- It's gonna matter when you find that money."
50:22;50:25;"- But Jake, I think also I need to pull focus here"
50:25;50:26;"and split two sides of it."
50:26;50:28;"I recall maybe you told me this,"
50:28;50:30;"and correct me if I'm wrong, but you were splitting,"
50:30;50:33;"'cause you put the songs up on like TuneCore, you know--"
50:33;50:35;"- I'm looking at my TuneCore account right now, yeah."
50:35;50:39;"- And that, Jake, that's master income."
50:39;50:40;"'Cause right, all these guys,"
50:40;50:42;"they showed up and they played with you, right?"
50:42;50:44;"These masters wouldn't exist"
50:44;50:45;"without all these people's time."
50:45;50:49;"So you're splitting that, that's your master revenues."
50:49;50:51;"- I see, that's just, okay."
50:51;50:52;"- You're publishing,"
50:52;50:54;"which I don't think you've assigned to anybody,"
50:54;50:57;"that is your authorship of the composition, which--"
50:57;50:58;"- Your songwriting."
50:58;51:00;"- You've written 100% of, let's just say,"
51:00;51:02;"which I think is probably fair to say."
51:02;51:04;"- So you know these people, you know Esquibit BMI,"
51:04;51:06;"do you think if Jake linked up with one of them,"
51:06;51:11;"knowing that he's got somewhere between 5 cents and $10"
51:11;51:12;"right there from Vampire Weekend"
51:12;51:14;"covering his song at Red Rocks,"
51:14;51:17;"but also imagining that, you know,"
51:17;51:19;"I think Mountain Brew's probably been on some playlist"
51:19;51:21;"that could have been played, you know,"
51:21;51:24;"here and there at a coffee shop or restaurant."
51:24;51:26;"- So coffee shops and restaurants."
51:26;51:26;"- Yeah."
51:26;51:28;"- That's impossible to track, right?"
51:28;51:30;"So what happens is you open up a coffee shop,"
51:30;51:32;"you open up a restaurant,"
51:32;51:33;"it's not like, you know,"
51:33;51:36;"somebody has to work overtime to submit their playlist"
51:36;51:38;"from the previous week."
51:38;51:40;"Those are blanket licenses."
51:40;51:42;"And so ASCAP and BMI, effective, you know,"
51:42;51:45;"they just, they bill these places and say,"
51:45;51:48;"if you want to play music in this spot, you know,"
51:48;51:49;"you've got to pay this blanket license."
51:49;51:52;"When you fill out your license,"
51:52;51:53;"they'll ask you how much revenue you make,"
51:53;51:56;"how many people fit into your restaurant, blah, blah, blah,"
51:56;51:57;"all these kinds of things."
51:57;52:01;"And so, you know, if you're horses,"
52:01;52:04;"maybe you're busting off $600 a year to answer that."
52:04;52:07;"- Horses is a hot new restaurant in LA, by the way."
52:07;52:09;"That's probably very confusing."
52:09;52:10;"- Yeah."
52:10;52:11;"- But that does not serve horse meat."
52:11;52:12;"- It doesn't serve horse meat."
52:12;52:13;"- It does not serve horse meat."
52:13;52:15;"- Actually, we're going to pivot to that in a second."
52:15;52:17;"- But anyway, so they'll pay like a blanket license."
52:17;52:18;"And then what ASCAP will do,"
52:18;52:21;"which is not dissimilar from what I will do,"
52:21;52:22;"I will get unassigned royalties"
52:22;52:25;"that will come in each quarter, you know,"
52:25;52:27;"that really just don't, they've been paid to us,"
52:27;52:29;"and it's not clear who they're owed to."
52:29;52:31;"And we, me, as a company,"
52:31;52:36;"we will distribute that income pro rata across our,"
52:36;52:39;"'cause there's what we call a lot of dust in our business."
52:39;52:42;"A lot of missing nickels and dimes that don't match up,"
52:42;52:43;"and we don't want them."
52:43;52:44;"As a company, we don't want to keep them."
52:44;52:45;"We don't want any liability."
52:45;52:46;"We don't want them."
52:46;52:47;"So we want to distribute them."
52:47;52:48;"We're going to get them off our books."
52:48;52:50;"And again, you know, for my company, well, not again,"
52:50;52:52;"but for my company, which is small,"
52:52;52:54;"I think last year,"
52:54;52:55;"well, it was a very insignificant amount of money,"
52:55;52:57;"but for a very large publisher,"
52:57;52:58;"it might be in the millions."
52:58;53:00;"And it probably is certainly in the millions."
53:00;53:03;"- Millions of dollars of dust, unclaimed."
53:03;53:06;"- Unclaimed, and they'll distribute it on a pro rata share."
53:06;53:09;"So, you know, the David Bowie estate, for instance,"
53:09;53:11;"would see more than Jake would see"
53:11;53:12;"in that distribution."
53:12;53:14;"- But it's definitely possible that Jake"
53:14;53:17;"has a few thousand bucks on the table,"
53:17;53:18;"distributed all over the world."
53:18;53:19;"- I want to hope so."
53:19;53:21;"I think the first thing you need to do is,"
53:21;53:23;"here's an interesting exercise, Jake,"
53:23;53:25;"and this is the Pandora's box,"
53:25;53:26;"as far as how much time you have."
53:26;53:28;"I think it'll take you 25 to 30 minutes"
53:28;53:31;"to affiliate with ASCAP or BMI."
53:31;53:34;"And then there's a company called the MLC.com."
53:34;53:36;"Now this is some fascinating (beep)"
53:36;53:39;"All of you guys I know are occasionally on Pitchfork."
53:39;53:41;"And you might recall like a year or so ago,"
53:41;53:43;"there was a ton of news on the music press"
53:43;53:46;"about how there was, you know, 750 million"
53:46;53:48;"or whatever hundreds of millions of dollars"
53:48;53:52;"in unclaimed mechanical income."
53:52;53:55;"And what it was is, if you didn't have a publisher"
53:55;53:57;"from the time that the DSPs kickstarted,"
53:57;54:00;"Apple, iTunes, all of these things,"
54:00;54:03;"or at least have an astute enough manager"
54:03;54:05;"or business manager collecting on your behalf,"
54:05;54:09;"all the mechanical royalties that were accrued"
54:09;54:12;"on behalf of writers who didn't have a publisher"
54:12;54:16;"or someone looking for them went to a black box."
54:16;54:19;"And it was an astounding amount of money."
54:19;54:23;"Now, mind you, performance, mechanical income combined,"
54:23;54:25;"if you have a million streams,"
54:25;54:30;"you might be talking about $250 to $500,"
54:30;54:33;"depending on how that person, whether it's a YouTube,"
54:33;54:34;"it's very hard to pinpoint."
54:34;54:37;"But point is a million dollars,"
54:37;54:39;"you're talking about a few hundred dollars."
54:39;54:42;"And if you had 100% of the song,"
54:42;54:46;"but imagine all of the people threw up so much music"
54:46;54:48;"and to get it up on the board,"
54:48;54:51;"it's not as if they had to have like the entire song"
54:51;54:55;"monetized, i.e. a label, i.e. every songwriter"
54:55;54:56;"having a publisher."
54:56;55:00;"They just based on whatever, you know,"
55:00;55:02;"distributions that, you know, copyright boards"
55:02;55:04;"or whatever their deals were with labels"
55:04;55:06;"or publishers or whatever."
55:06;55:09;"They just knew that each time a stream happened"
55:09;55:12;"at this DSP or in within that DSP,"
55:12;55:14;"this tier or that tier,"
55:14;55:16;"X amount of money goes to the songwriter"
55:16;55:18;"and X amount of money goes to the label"
55:18;55:19;"or the owner of the master."
55:19;55:21;"- Right, and they don't know who to send it to."
55:21;55:22;"So they just put it in a black box."
55:22;55:23;"- And if they don't know who to send it to,"
55:23;55:25;"it goes to a black box and they had so much money."
55:25;55:30;"And so in America, coalition of publishers got together"
55:30;55:31;"and started a thing called the MLC,"
55:31;55:34;"the Mechanical Licensing Collective,"
55:34;55:35;"I think is what it stands for."
55:35;55:40;"The, like the word the, mlc.com."
55:40;55:41;"And you can go on that,"
55:41;55:44;"just like you can go on ASCAP or BMI or CSAC,"
55:44;55:48;"and you can look and you can see, anyone can."
55:48;55:52;"This is like not, this is kind of seen as publisher juju,"
55:52;55:54;"but this is not, this is some straight up,"
55:54;55:55;"anyone can do this."
55:55;55:57;"- So this is what I meant before."
55:57;55:59;"Can't we just like look up Mountain Brews?"
55:59;56:02;"- Well, we can look up to see if Jake is affiliated,"
56:02;56:04;"but we can't look up and just see a number next to it"
56:04;56:06;"and go, ""Hey, there's $80 here waiting."""
56:06;56:08;"That feature doesn't exist."
56:08;56:10;"- No matches found on Mountain Brews."
56:10;56:11;"I'm putting in my name."
56:11;56:14;"Well, it's giving me a lot of songs called Brew."
56:14;56:15;"- Guys, I have 120 seconds,"
56:15;56:18;"and then I got to go do some math with my daughter."
56:18;56:22;"But all of this that I'm telling you, these details,"
56:22;56:23;"this is just America."
56:23;56:26;"This is just for revenue generated in America."
56:26;56:31;"So Canada, instead of the MLC, they had the CMRA."
56:31;56:34;"You know, Germany's got a mechanical collection society."
56:34;56:34;"France does too."
56:34;56:37;"And that's in addition to the PROs I mentioned."
56:37;56:38;"- So it all adds up."
56:38;56:43;"- Yeah, and also my Pandora's box comment to Jake,"
56:43;56:45;"he can go affiliate with ASCAP and BMI,"
56:45;56:49;"and he can go to the MLC and he can affiliate there too."
56:49;56:52;"But he's just at that point got the 50 states covered."
56:52;56:54;"He doesn't have the rest of the world."
56:54;56:57;"However, he might just get that Red Rocks bread"
56:57;56:59;"that would have originated in America."
56:59;57:00;"- Yeah, I know we did cover--"
57:00;57:04;"- So help us track down Jake's Red Rock bread."
57:04;57:04;"- I can't."
57:04;57:06;"- Okay, get on it."
57:06;57:08;"We'll return to this on another episode."
57:08;57:10;"I feel like I did license with one of them."
57:10;57:13;"When you upload stuff to Bandcamp or TuneCore,"
57:13;57:15;"I feel like they, I could be misremembering."
57:15;57:16;"- I don't know."
57:16;57:17;"- I don't know either."
57:17;57:18;"I forget."
57:18;57:19;"I honestly don't remember."
57:19;57:20;"We got to do some research,"
57:20;57:22;"'cause I know we did play ""Mountain Brews,"""
57:22;57:26;"or at least part of it in Germany."
57:26;57:28;"Couple other shows I remember, yeah."
57:28;57:30;"- All right, well, Seinfeld, pack your (beep)"
57:30;57:31;"flying out to Germany tomorrow."
57:31;57:33;"We need to come back with Jake's money."
57:33;57:34;"- I'm ready."
57:34;57:37;"- All right, well, thanks so much, Morrie."
57:37;57:39;"- Thanks for coming in, dude."
57:39;57:39;"- It's an honor."
57:39;57:41;"I hope that wasn't too boring."
57:41;57:42;"- No, man. - No, it was great."
57:42;57:43;"- All right, guys, thank you."
57:43;57:44;"- All right, peace."

58:37;58:39;"these hundreds of millions of dollars"
58:39;58:41;"'cause it's not like there's one person"
58:41;58:44;"who probably was owed $15 million."
58:44;58:47;"You're probably talking about millions of songwriters,"
58:47;58:49;"but there probably was somebody somewhere,"
58:49;58:54;"maybe like the child of some long dead songwriter"
58:54;58:57;"who probably really could have used 8,000 bucks."
58:57;58:58;"You know, I bet there's stories like that"

59:01;59:04;"maybe the person, the musician, the songwriter"
59:04;59:07;"who's been gone for two decades"
59:07;59:10;"and maybe is not Motley Crue money,"
59:10;59:11;"but I could totally see that somebody's like,"
59:11;59:15;"""Oh yeah, we don't know anything about this."
59:15;59:17;"""We have the money from when they were alive."""
59:17;59:21;"Like maybe they're owed eight to $10,000,"
59:21;59:24;"something that could really help somebody out."
59:24;59:27;"- Yeah, a lot of dust."
59:27;59:29;"- To put a fine- - A lot of dust."
59:29;59:34;"- To put a fine point on the Motley Crue popularity."
59:34;59:34;"- Yeah."
59:34;59:37;"- And it's just a funny expression,"
59:37;59:39;"but this is what Matt just sent me."
59:39;59:43;"The Motley Crue Essentials playlist is charting higher"
59:43;59:46;"right now than Drake Essentials on Apple Music."
59:46;59:47;"- What? - What?"
59:47;59:51;"- The effect is being felt globally in 150 markets."
59:51;59:53;"- Because of Pam and Tommy?"
59:53;59:53;"- Yes, it must be."
59:53;59:55;"- I can't even imagine anybody would watch that"
59:55;59:57;"and actually wanna throw on some Motley Crue."
59:57;59:58;"It has so little to do with the fact."
59:58;59:59;"- Matt's saying no."
59:59;01:00:01;"Matt, you wanna chime in here?"
01:00:01;01:00:02;"- You sent me this."
01:00:02;01:00:04;"- It was March, 2019."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"That was from March, 2019."
01:00:05;01:00:06;"- Oh, so that's even crazier."
01:00:06;01:00:09;"- Is that when ""The Dirt"" the movie came out?"
01:00:09;01:00:10;"- Yeah. - Yes."
01:00:10;01:00:11;"- Even that, I feel like the only person"
01:00:11;01:00:15;"I've ever talked about ""The Dirt"" with is you, Jake,"
01:00:15;01:00:16;"and other people on this show."
01:00:16;01:00:19;"Like literally, nobody else in my life was like,"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"""Hey, did you see 'The Dirt'?"""
01:00:21;01:00:22;"The Motley Crue biopic?"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"Not a single person outside of the time-crazy universe."
01:00:25;01:00:26;"- Coastal elite."
01:00:26;01:00:30;"Drive out of California."
01:00:30;01:00:33;"- And I watched ""The Dirt"" and I loved ""The Dirt,"""
01:00:33;01:00:34;"but I was like, ""Listen, they don't have the catalog."
01:00:34;01:00:38;"""I'm not gonna throw on their subpar catalog"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"""after I watch that movie."
01:00:40;01:00:41;"""I'm gonna throw on some Neil Young."""
01:00:41;01:00:43;"You know what's funny, though?"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"I'm suddenly having this memory."
01:00:45;01:00:48;"There was some time in the car in the past few months"
01:00:48;01:00:51;"where I'm pretty sure Rashida said"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"""Dr. Feelgood"" was like a good song."
01:00:53;01:00:55;"It was like kind of out of nowhere."
01:00:55;01:00:56;"- Dr. Feelgood."
01:00:56;01:00:57;"(laughing)"
01:00:57;01:00:58;"- I feel like we were like--"
01:00:58;01:00:59;"- I think we've seen this all the way."
01:00:59;01:01:01;"It is kind of the best."
01:01:01;01:01:03;"I mean, like, the guitar parts are sick."
01:01:03;01:01:04;"- You know what it was?"
01:01:04;01:01:05;"Okay, I'm remembering the story."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"This is so inside, but we were driving in the car"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"and we were like, maybe we were driving"
01:01:09;01:01:13;"through Beverly Hills and she made some reference."
01:01:13;01:01:15;"You know that shrink in Beverly Hills"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"that you pay so much money to go see?"
01:01:17;01:01:18;"And I like didn't understand the reference."
01:01:18;01:01:20;"She's like, ""Oh, it's Prince."
01:01:20;01:01:22;"""It's at the beginning of 'Let's Go Crazy'."""
01:01:22;01:01:24;"You know, he's talking and he says something about,"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"""You know that shrink you go see in Beverly Hills?"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"""You know, Dr. Feelgood."""
01:01:28;01:01:29;"And I said, ""Wait, no, no."
01:01:29;01:01:30;"""I don't think it was Dr. Feelgood."
01:01:30;01:01:32;"""I don't even remember this part of the song."
01:01:32;01:01:33;"""We threw on the Prince song."
01:01:33;01:01:34;"""He does say that."
01:01:34;01:01:35;"""He doesn't say Dr. Feelgood."
01:01:35;01:01:36;"""He says something else."""
01:01:36;01:01:38;"And I was like, ""Oh, wait, Dr. Feelgood."
01:01:38;01:01:40;"""You're probably thinking of the Motley Crue song."""
01:01:40;01:01:41;"And then she was like, ""Oh yeah."""
01:01:41;01:01:43;"She's like, ""That's a good song."""
01:01:43;01:01:45;"And I was like, ""You like that Motley Crue song?"""
01:01:45;01:01:47;"She's like, ""Yeah, I mean, I don't like Motley Crue,"
01:01:47;01:01:48;"""but that was a good song."""
01:01:48;01:01:49;"And I was like, ""Okay."""
01:01:49;01:01:51;"In my head, I was like, ""Noted."""
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- Yeah."
01:01:52;01:01:54;"- So, okay, I think, maybe it's not even a Coastal Elite thing."
01:01:54;01:01:59;"It's like a lot of people, guys, go talk to your wives."
01:01:59;01:02:01;"They're low-key listening and enjoying Motley Crue."
01:02:01;01:02:04;"- Rashida going out of her way to like make a point"
01:02:04;01:02:07;"that like a rock song is like good is--"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"- I know, that's why I really clocked it."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Wow."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- She's not home right now or I would ask her about it."
01:02:12;01:02:13;"All right, let's make a note."
01:02:13;01:02:16;"We'll do it for the next episode."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"Ask about that."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"But yeah, it really, it stood out to me."
01:02:19;01:02:21;"I was just like, ""Huh."""
01:02:21;01:02:22;"Yeah, I mean, I guess back then too,"
01:02:22;01:02:25;"it's like people would just watch MTV"
01:02:25;01:02:26;"and just like take it all in."
01:02:26;01:02:30;"Like whether you like, if you like hip hop and R&B"
01:02:30;01:02:30;"or you like rock, either way,"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"you just like took it all in kind of."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"- Oh yeah, I mean, and you know,"
01:02:34;01:02:35;"like I said a few episodes ago,"
01:02:35;01:02:40;"I bought the Dr. Feelgood tape at the Danbury Fair Mall '89"
01:02:40;01:02:42;"and loved the album when I was 12."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"- Right, so there was a time in your life"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"where you admitted that Motley Crue"
01:02:46;01:02:47;"was better than Neil Young."
01:02:47;01:02:52;"- I'm pretty into ""Girl, don't go away mad, just go away."""
01:02:52;01:02:53;"That's a pretty good one."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"- Oh, I don't know that."
01:02:54;01:02:56;"Is that another power ballad? - It's like the fifth single."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"It's like the fifth, mid-tempo."
01:02:58;01:03:03;"It's like the fifth single off of Dr. Feelgood."
01:03:03;01:03:05;"- Maybe they've been way too hard on them."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- Wait, Matt, can you throw it on?"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"(rock music)"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"- Is it possible that Motley Crue's catalog"
01:03:10;01:03:12;"is worth more than Pearl Jam's?"
01:03:12;01:03:14;"- Unlikely."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"- Let the free market decide."
01:03:15;01:03:18;"(rock music)"
01:03:18;01:03:25;"- Wall Street says yes, Motley Crue, way more valuable."
01:03:25;01:03:28;"- Yeah, Wall Street's pretty bearish on PJ."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"(laughing)"
01:03:30;01:03:33;"- You start getting those like random,"
01:03:33;01:03:36;"like cheap looking ads on websites."
01:03:36;01:03:38;"They're like, ""You won't believe what Warren Buffet"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"""had to say about Motley Crue."
01:03:40;01:03:41;"""Click here now."""
01:03:41;01:03:43;"(laughing)"
01:03:43;01:03:48;"- There's like fireman's pension funds"
01:03:48;01:03:51;"investing in the white snake catalog."
01:03:51;01:03:53;"(laughing)"
01:03:53;01:03:56;"(rock music)"
01:03:56;01:04:07;"- Like the last one, it would be like,"
01:04:07;01:04:10;"is the indie rock catalogs worth anything?"
01:04:10;01:04:12;"- It's not worth Motley Crue money."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- No."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- Feelgood."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"- It's worth something."
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Like Wilco or something, or like, you know,"
01:04:19;01:04:23;"like the more respectable kind of domesticated side"
01:04:23;01:04:24;"of indie rock."
01:04:24;01:04:25;"- Right."
01:04:25;01:04:26;"I wonder."
01:04:26;01:04:28;"(rock music)"
01:04:31;01:04:41;"- Do you think like Dave Matthews Band catalog"
01:04:41;01:04:44;"is worth more than Motley Crue?"
01:04:44;01:04:45;"- I don't know anymore."
01:04:45;01:04:46;"I don't think anything's worth more"
01:04:46;01:04:48;"than Motley Crue catalog."
01:04:48;01:04:53;"- Except for like David Bowie and Neil Young."
01:04:53;01:04:56;"- I think like other than Satellite."
01:04:56;01:04:58;"I mean, you have to think like what songs"
01:04:58;01:04:59;"can be used in commercials."
01:04:59;01:05:00;"- Crash."
01:05:00;01:05:01;"Crash is a beautiful song."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"- Or Crash, sorry, Crash."
01:05:03;01:05:04;"- Satellite's a great song too."
01:05:04;01:05:06;"- But you know, I'm just saying there's a handful."
01:05:06;01:05:07;"Yes, Crash, Satellite."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"There's a handful of DMV songs you could use in commercials."
01:05:10;01:05:12;"Probably not that many Wilco songs,"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"not that many Pavement."
01:05:13;01:05:15;"- I think you could use Wilco songs"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"just as easily as Motley Crue."
01:05:17;01:05:18;"It's just a different thing."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"If you're selling like jalapeno cheddar poppers"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"and Applebee's, then yeah, you throw on the Motley Crue."
01:05:23;01:05:26;"But if you're selling like something like tasteful,"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"like technological product, you use Wilco."
01:05:28;01:05:31;"You're selling some sort of like family minivan"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"or something, you know."
01:05:33;01:05:35;"- Like a family minivan getting into Dr. Fields."
01:05:35;01:05:37;"- No, no, no, that's Wilco."
01:05:37;01:05:40;"Goldfish could just randomly one day be like,"
01:05:40;01:05:42;"yeah, we're using a Wilco song."
01:05:42;01:05:44;"We're paying a lot of money for it."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"A small number of people have to sign off on that."
01:05:46;01:05:50;"But just year in, year out, it's about the fans."
01:05:50;01:05:55;"It's like, are people just streaming Motley Crue?"
01:05:55;01:05:57;"And I guess the answer is yes."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"- They're putting up big numbers."
01:05:58;01:05:59;"- They're putting up big numbers."
01:05:59;01:06:01;"They don't even need commercials."
01:06:01;01:06:02;"The people have spoken."
01:06:02;01:06:05;"Motley Crue is a great American rock band."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"- I mean, if GNR sold their catalog,"
01:06:07;01:06:11;"I would think it would be worth more, but I don't know."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"- It's saying--"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"- It would have to be worth so much more."
01:06:14;01:06:15;"I mean, I guess-- - It has to be worth more."
01:06:15;01:06:17;"- Although they don't have as many albums."
01:06:17;01:06:20;"- No, but song for song,"
01:06:20;01:06:22;"there's more commercial hits on there."
01:06:22;01:06:26;"- I can't wait for us to make a big short style movie"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"that's about how all the big Wall Street banks"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"are investing all this money in the GNR catalog."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"And then there's this one Michael Burry,"
01:06:34;01:06:36;"played by Christian Bale, holdout,"
01:06:36;01:06:39;"who's just like, no way, I'm shorting GNR."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"And it's like, the street's like,"
01:06:41;01:06:44;"who is this (beep) guy putting all his money in Motley Crue?"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"What does he know that we don't know?"
01:06:46;01:06:49;"GNR is a subprime loan, man."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"- How much do you think The Dead would get"
01:06:50;01:06:51;"for their catalog?"
01:06:51;01:06:52;"- Less than Motley Crue. - A lot more now"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"than 10 years ago."
01:06:54;01:06:55;"- Yeah, more now."
01:06:55;01:06:57;"I mean-- - Again, The Dead,"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"in a strictly commercial sense, doesn't have the catalog."
01:07:00;01:07:01;"- They have dedicated fans,"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"and The Dead weirdly sells more records"
01:07:04;01:07:06;"than a lot of defunct bands,"
01:07:06;01:07:10;"because if The Dead puts out a new Dick's Picks,"
01:07:10;01:07:13;"that'll chart, because you'll get a lot of people"
01:07:13;01:07:15;"who wanna buy it the week it comes out."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"In terms of streaming, it's gonna do solid numbers,"
01:07:18;01:07:22;"but yeah, first of all, I'm really,"
01:07:22;01:07:25;"Dr. Feel Good is not a great song."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"- That was not that tight."
01:07:27;01:07:29;"- Again, no disrespect to the organization,"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"no disrespect to the guys in Motley Crue,"
01:07:31;01:07:33;"we're not pulling an Eddie Vedder here."
01:07:33;01:07:34;"That one song is not that tight."
01:07:34;01:07:36;"- Kickstart my heart, on the other hand."
01:07:36;01:07:38;"Matt, don't kickstart my heart."
01:07:38;01:07:41;"Let's just listen to the Dr. Feel Good album."
01:07:41;01:07:44;"(rock music)"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"(laughing)"
01:07:47;01:07:50;"- That's pretty cool."
01:07:50;01:07:52;"That's pretty cool, like,"

01:11:07;01:11:11;"Heart of Gold, it's not putting up the numbers."
01:11:11;01:11:13;"The song Kickstart my heart alone"
01:11:13;01:11:17;"generates $30 million of income in the average year."
01:11:17;01:11:21;"- I am curious what Kickstart my heart"
01:11:21;01:11:22;"has in terms of plays."
01:11:22;01:11:27;"Kickstart my heart, I'm amazed by this, has 359 million."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"- Wow."
01:11:28;01:11:31;"- I just had this sort of fun thought of this equity firm"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"that bought the Motley Crue catalog and they're all psyched."
01:11:34;01:11:38;"And then like some younger guy there,"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"he was sort of a Gen Xer walks in, he's like,"
01:11:40;01:11:44;"""Guys, I wanna buy Wilco's catalog for 150."""
01:11:44;01:11:47;"And he's like, ""What the (beep) are you talking about?"""
01:11:47;01:11:47;"And they're like,"
01:11:47;01:11:51;"""I think it's worth more than Motley Crue's catalog."""
01:11:51;01:11:53;"And everyone's like, ""Get out of here."""
01:11:53;01:11:56;"""John, what are you talking about?"""
01:11:56;01:11:58;"And he's like, ""Look, I go to a lot of coffee shops,"
01:11:58;01:12:01;"""they're constantly playing Wilco."
01:12:01;01:12:04;"""I'm in Highland Park, they're playing Wilco."""
01:12:04;01:12:06;"And they're just like, ""You're out of your mind."""
01:12:06;01:12:08;"- It'll be interesting to see like,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"will we ever reach a saturation point"
01:12:10;01:12:14;"when the fact that there's like so much music"
01:12:14;01:12:18;"being heavily invested in from the past"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"will somehow lead to some sort of like conflict"
01:12:20;01:12:23;"maybe in 30 or 40 years where like,"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"there's just such a huge wedge of old music"
01:12:27;01:12:32;"taking up space culturally in terms of playlists, whatever."
01:12:32;01:12:33;"I mean, it's hard to picture this,"
01:12:33;01:12:36;"but that somehow younger musicians will feel like"
01:12:36;01:12:40;"we're competing against 100 years of recorded music"
01:12:40;01:12:43;"that giant corporations have invested lots of money in."
01:12:43;01:12:47;"It's actively like suppressing our ability for growth."
01:12:47;01:12:48;"I don't think that's happening now."
01:12:48;01:12:51;"Like obviously there's, you know,"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"The Weeknd or something is streaming more than Motley Crue,"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Neil Young or Bob Dylan."
01:12:56;01:12:59;"But I just wonder if in another 40 years,"
01:12:59;01:13:00;"if even in 30 years,"
01:13:00;01:13:04;"we'll be approaching 100 years of recorded pop music."
01:13:04;01:13:05;"People might even put it long,"
01:13:05;01:13:06;"but I'm saying, you know, starting with the '50s,"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"the rock and roll era."
01:13:08;01:13:09;"- Post-war, yeah."
01:13:09;01:13:12;"- We'll be in the 2050s in 27 years"
01:13:12;01:13:16;"when there's like 100 years of like iconic music"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"that now is worth hundreds of millions of dollars."
01:13:18;01:13:20;"That'll be interesting."
01:13:20;01:13:24;"If they'll start to be like some real wars about like,"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"you know, who's in the history books."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Or maybe it's the music things will always be upturned."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"You never know."
01:13:30;01:13:32;"All right, time to get into the top five."
01:13:33;01:13:35;"- It's time for the top five."
01:13:35;01:13:39;"Five on iTunes."
01:13:39;01:13:42;"- So this week for the top five,"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"we'll be comparing the top five songs"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"on the Billboard charts this week in 1969"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"with the top five songs on the iTunes chart."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"Now, first of all, why 1969?"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"- Because if I had a time machine,"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"that is the year I would go to."
01:13:56;01:14:00;"- Absolutely, and you'd start asking questions"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"around the Charles Manson murders."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"I mean, depending on what month you went,"
01:14:04;01:14:08;"you could even stop them and/or find out for sure."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"- I mean, I feel like we fantasize about this,"
01:14:10;01:14:11;"you and I getting a time machine,"
01:14:11;01:14:15;"going back to '69, catching a dead show or two."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"- Yeah, and being very careful not to change"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"the course of history too much."
01:14:19;01:14:20;"- Exactly."
01:14:20;01:14:23;"- But definitely, yeah, definitely seeing the dead."
01:14:23;01:14:27;"The reason we chose 1969 is I don't have my notes here."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"I believe that was the year Motley Crue formed."
01:14:29;01:14:32;"- That was the year that Mick Mars"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"joined his first rock band."
01:14:34;01:14:37;"- The hilarious thing is that actually,"
01:14:37;01:14:39;"yeah, Motley Crue probably formed at what earliest,"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"1979, probably like '80, right?"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"- I'm going to guess like '81, '82."
01:14:44;01:14:45;"It was '81."
01:14:45;01:14:47;"- '81. - But I feel like Mick Mars"
01:14:47;01:14:48;"was in a band. - But actually, yeah,"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"famously Mick Mars, the guitarist in Motley Crue,"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"was so much older that he actually might've been,"
01:14:52;01:14:56;"he probably was in a psychedelic rock band in 1969."
01:14:56;01:14:57;"- So he was born in '51."
01:14:57;01:14:59;"So yeah, he would've been in a band in '69."
01:14:59;01:15:00;"He would've been 18."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"- Oh, yeah, definitely."
01:15:02;01:15:04;"And he was like a guitar prodigy, definitely,"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"making some psychedelic music."
01:15:06;01:15:08;"But the real reason we chose 1969"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"is just because this is episode 169."
01:15:12;01:15:13;"- Oh, cool."
01:15:15;01:15:16;"Kind of a stretch."
01:15:16;01:15:19;"- Well, that's what it is, folks."
01:15:19;01:15:24;"This is episode 169. - I think it's neat."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"- That is crazy that there's 169 episodes"
01:15:26;01:15:28;"of this radio program."
01:15:28;01:15:32;"Just as fresh as it was in the early days."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"- Oh, yeah, fresher."
01:15:34;01:15:35;"- I mean, yeah, say what you will,"
01:15:35;01:15:38;"remarkably consistent show."
01:15:38;01:15:39;"- I know we talk about it a lot"
01:15:39;01:15:41;"at time crisis type movies,"
01:15:41;01:15:43;"but I think we might've nailed it."
01:15:43;01:15:46;"I think there's a movie where Ezra and Jake,"
01:15:46;01:15:49;"it's an adult villain, Ted's,"
01:15:49;01:15:52;"but they go back to stop the Manson murders,"
01:15:52;01:15:55;"but end up at a dead show and totally waylaid."
01:15:55;01:15:57;"So they don't do the thing."
01:15:57;01:16:00;"- It's got a bit of a Cheech and Chong, Harold and Kumar."
01:16:00;01:16:01;"- Yes."
01:16:01;01:16:03;"- It's a movie about middle-aged stoners."
01:16:03;01:16:07;"They go back, get blazed, go to the dead show."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"The Manson murders happen."
01:16:08;01:16:11;"- There's a franchise here, yeah."
01:16:11;01:16:13;"- This is our Grateful Dead, Jonah Hill,"
01:16:13;01:16:15;"counter-programming film."
01:16:15;01:16:17;"It's a different, takes a different bent."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"I like it."
01:16:18;01:16:21;"- If you liked Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"and the Scorsese, Hill, Grateful Dead movie,"
01:16:24;01:16:25;"you're gonna love this low budget,"
01:16:25;01:16:30;"this low budget indie comedy from TC Productions."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"- No rights to the music,"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"no rights to the likeness or the name."
01:16:34;01:16:38;"- Okay, before we jump into the top five,"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"we just briefly, we got to talk about the fact"
01:16:40;01:16:43;"that apparently there's a Billy Joel biopic."
01:16:43;01:16:44;"- Exactly."
01:16:44;01:16:48;"- Coming down the pipeline from gigantic studios"
01:16:48;01:16:53;"announcing that a Billy Joel biopic titled Piano Man"
01:16:53;01:16:56;"is in the works and will focus on Joel's early years"
01:16:56;01:16:59;"from being discovered by Erwin Mazur,"
01:16:59;01:17:02;"who managed the hassles the band Joel joined as a teenager,"
01:17:02;01:17:06;"to meeting and working with Clive Davis in 1972."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"Many people find that to be the most fascinating period"
01:17:08;01:17:11;"of Billy's career the years before"
01:17:11;01:17:13;"he was a successful musician,"
01:17:13;01:17:15;"which actually, to be fair, in some people's case,"
01:17:15;01:17:17;"that is the most interesting time."
01:17:17;01:17:18;"Billy, I don't know."
01:17:18;01:17:21;"- No, Billy's most interesting time is playing in the USSR"
01:17:21;01:17:23;"and reading reviews on stage."
01:17:23;01:17:25;"- Amazing."
01:17:25;01:17:27;"- That's peak Billy."
01:17:27;01:17:28;"- Okay, but here's the thing about this."
01:17:28;01:17:32;"Now, before you, if any, we got any BJ heads listening,"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"don't get too excited"
01:17:34;01:17:37;"'cause Billy Joel has nothing to do with this."
01:17:37;01:17:39;"In fact, I found it kind of strange"
01:17:39;01:17:41;"as I was reading that paragraph about, you know,"
01:17:41;01:17:44;"Billy being discovered by Erwin Mazur."
01:17:44;01:17:48;"Like, okay, am I supposed to know who that was, the hassles?"
01:17:48;01:17:52;"I actually do know about Billy Joel's, like, prog band."
01:17:52;01:17:53;"I think it was called Attila."
01:17:53;01:17:55;"I've never heard of the hassles."
01:17:55;01:17:58;"Anyway, this company, Gigantic,"
01:17:58;01:17:59;"the reason they're focusing on this period"
01:17:59;01:18:03;"is because they acquired the life rights to Erwin Mazur."
01:18:04;01:18:07;"Mazur said in a statement, ""What a dream come true."
01:18:07;01:18:09;"""These are the real life events I witnessed firsthand"

01:18:21;01:18:24;"Adam Ripp is attached to Write & Direct."
01:18:24;01:18:25;"- Who's that? - And here's the thing."
01:18:25;01:18:27;"I don't know who Adam Ripp is."
01:18:27;01:18:29;"For all I know, he's a great writer and director."
01:18:29;01:18:31;"I don't mean, I don't want to impugn his talents,"

01:18:45;01:18:47;"but somebody (beep) up and ""Cold Spring Harbor"""
01:18:47;01:18:52;"got pressed or mastered at the wrong speed."
01:18:52;01:18:53;"So it's sped up."
01:18:53;01:18:56;"It's just a famously poorly produced record."
01:18:56;01:19:00;"You know with some people, it's their first record,"
01:19:00;01:19:01;"the Doors or something."
01:19:01;01:19:03;"It's like, whoa, that's the first Doors record"
01:19:03;01:19:04;"that started off."
01:19:04;01:19:05;"And then you always find these people where you're like,"
01:19:05;01:19:07;"well, their first record, it kind of doesn't count."
01:19:07;01:19:09;"It's not really like part of the canon."
01:19:09;01:19:11;"So anyway, it's a little strange,"
01:19:11;01:19:13;"but this is what Adam Ripp, the son of Artie Ripp,"
01:19:13;01:19:15;"had to say, ""Billy Joel has been a part of my life"

01:19:41;01:19:44;"I could imagine people being, like him reading about this,"
01:19:44;01:19:45;"and just like blowing a gasket,"

01:19:59;01:20:01;"I mean, and to be fair to Billy Joel,"
01:20:01;01:20:03;"I believe these statements are earnest"
01:20:03;01:20:06;"that his old, old, old manager"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"remembers those years fondly"
01:20:08;01:20:09;"when he was watching this young guy"
01:20:09;01:20:12;"who went on to become a superstar be in a band."
01:20:12;01:20:14;"And I'm also willing to believe that Adam Rip,"
01:20:14;01:20:17;"the writer/director, of course has this deep connection,"
01:20:17;01:20:19;"probably spent his whole life with his dad being like,"

01:20:38;01:20:40;"""It must seem so random to him."""
01:20:40;01:20:41;"But anyway."
01:20:41;01:20:43;"- That would be an incredible framing device"
01:20:43;01:20:45;"if it like started off with Billy Joel"
01:20:45;01:20:48;"being like reading the trades, like, ""What the (beep)?"""
01:20:48;01:20:50;"And somebody's like, ""Billy, what are y'all heated up about?"""
01:20:50;01:20:51;"And then he tells the story,"
01:20:51;01:20:55;"and it flashes back to the old days."
01:20:55;01:20:58;"- But they can't use his likeness or his name."
01:20:58;01:20:59;"- That's right, yeah."
01:20:59;01:21:01;"I think it'd be like a great Charlie Kaufman"
01:21:01;01:21:02;"kind of adaptation kind of thing."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"- How do you make a movie without having"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"the rights to somebody's name or likeness?"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Do you need the rights to them?"
01:21:08;01:21:09;"You don't need to go clear."
01:21:09;01:21:11;"- Yeah, 'cause they made that Hendrix movie,"
01:21:11;01:21:14;"and they didn't have the music rights."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"I know they didn't have the music rights to that."
01:21:16;01:21:18;"It was with Andre 3000, right?"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"- Oh yeah, did not see it, but."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"- Didn't see it either, but famously,"
01:21:22;01:21:23;"they didn't have the,"
01:21:23;01:21:28;"I guess they must have had the likeness and naming rights."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"- Yeah, I don't know, I've never understood these rules."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"- Let's get Morgan back on the phone."
01:21:32;01:21:33;"- Yeah, we gotta get Morgan."
01:21:33;01:21:34;"Morgan, you know about this (beep)?"
01:21:34;01:21:38;"Well, not really, but I'll be happy to chime in."
01:21:38;01:21:39;"I mean, this is a little random,"
01:21:39;01:21:42;"but I went to a screening and Q&A"
01:21:42;01:21:45;"of the film ""Licorice Pizza"" from last year,"
01:21:45;01:21:47;"Paul Thomas Anderson film."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Have you guys all seen this?"
01:21:48;01:21:49;"- Yep."
01:21:49;01:21:51;"- Even if you haven't seen it,"
01:21:51;01:21:52;"you might've seen the trailer,"
01:21:52;01:21:56;"and Bradley Cooper has this very memorable part"
01:21:56;01:22:00;"where he plays a borderline psychotic movie producer,"
01:22:00;01:22:03;"Hollywood guy, John Peters."
01:22:03;01:22:04;"I mean, everybody's great,"
01:22:04;01:22:05;"Ned, Lana, Cooper, all these,"
01:22:05;01:22:08;"but Bradley Cooper, he comes in for like 10 minutes,"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"and he has this amazing section"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"where he's this total nut,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"and he has these, keeps talking about"
01:22:14;01:22:15;"how he's dating Barbra Streisand."
01:22:15;01:22:17;"So I went to this screening,"
01:22:17;01:22:22;"and at the end, PTA was taking questions from the audience,"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"and somebody said, ""So that Bradley Cooper character,"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"holy (beep) like, what a wild guy."
01:22:26;01:22:28;"That was a real guy?"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"And that was the real name you used, John Peters?"""
01:22:30;01:22:32;"And the PTA was like, ""Yeah."""
01:22:32;01:22:34;"And they're like, ""What's the story with this guy?"""
01:22:34;01:22:37;"And he's like, he was like this legendary producer."
01:22:37;01:22:38;"He produced ""Top Gun."""
01:22:38;01:22:42;"He's like well-known, and he said something like,"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"""And from what I can tell from all like"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"the old Hollywood people who've seen this movie,"
01:22:46;01:22:47;"we kind of nailed him."
01:22:47;01:22:49;"He really was that crazy."""
01:22:49;01:22:51;"And anyway, he's not alive anymore."
01:22:51;01:22:52;"I don't know if that has anything to do with it,"
01:22:52;01:22:53;"but he's telling this story,"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"and I'm thinking like, so he like"
01:22:55;01:22:58;"creates this totally insane character on screen,"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"which maybe is how this guy actually was,"
01:23:00;01:23:01;"but he's a real guy."
01:23:01;01:23:04;"He can use his real name in a fictional film,"
01:23:04;01:23:07;"maybe just 'cause he's not around to say anything,"
01:23:07;01:23:08;"but that, I assume, you know,"
01:23:08;01:23:13;"this is not like some like tiny like college student film."
01:23:13;01:23:15;"They must have gone through the proper channels."
01:23:15;01:23:18;"So maybe you're kind of allowed to do that."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"I also seem to remember,"
01:23:20;01:23:21;"sometimes you hear about movies"
01:23:21;01:23:23;"where like the real person comes out,"
01:23:23;01:23:25;"says, ""I don't want them playing me,"""
01:23:25;01:23:27;"but they seem to have no recourse."
01:23:27;01:23:28;"So maybe you are--"
01:23:28;01:23:29;"- David Fincher made the Facebook movie."
01:23:29;01:23:31;"I mean, there's plenty of movies."
01:23:31;01:23:32;"I don't think Mark Zuckerberg was like,"
01:23:32;01:23:33;"""Hell yeah, dude, make that."""
01:23:33;01:23:35;"- Usually in that case,"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"do they option the rights to an article"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"or something written about it,"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"and that's how they get away with it?"
01:23:40;01:23:43;"Like wasn't, like all these startup shows"
01:23:43;01:23:45;"that are coming, like the founder was a podcast,"
01:23:45;01:23:48;"not the founder, the Elizabeth Holmes."
01:23:48;01:23:50;"- Well, Nick, you work in that section of show biz."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"When somebody options a podcast"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"or an article about something,"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"is that just because they want to use that article"
01:23:56;01:23:59;"or podcast as a kind of like well-researched,"
01:23:59;01:24:02;"structural resource?"
01:24:02;01:24:05;"Or is it because that that's like a weird backdoor"
01:24:05;01:24:08;"where now you also get to use everybody's name?"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"- It's both."
01:24:09;01:24:11;"I think that you have to have a,"
01:24:11;01:24:13;"you do have to option someone's life rights."
01:24:13;01:24:16;"So in the case of Billy Joel's manager,"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"they option his life rights."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"And I think that they'll have to be able"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"to use Billy Joel on some level."
01:24:22;01:24:24;"- Because he was in this man's life."
01:24:24;01:24:26;"- He was in this man's life."
01:24:26;01:24:29;"How much, it's sort of like everything we're talking about"
01:24:29;01:24:31;"with the Ask App stuff, something I didn't say"
01:24:31;01:24:34;"that Matt sent me was if a restaurant"
01:24:34;01:24:37;"is less than 2,000 square feet,"
01:24:37;01:24:40;"then they don't have to share any money, right?"
01:24:40;01:24:41;"Like they don't have to pay Ask App."
01:24:41;01:24:43;"- Oh, they don't have to pay for the music, interesting."
01:24:43;01:24:44;"- Yeah, so it's similar here."
01:24:44;01:24:46;"I think it's like how much you use it"
01:24:47;01:24:52;"or being able to cross-reference a certain amount"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"of the real stuff with other documentation, right?"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"Of like, oh, Billy Joel is in an article here"
01:24:57;01:24:58;"doing this thing."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"- But who's checking all this stuff?"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"Or I guess that would probably come into play"
01:25:02;01:25:05;"if and when Billy Joel sues the (beep) out of them."
01:25:05;01:25:06;"- Yeah, and it gets made."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"Yeah, whatever, someone should be doing it."
01:25:08;01:25:09;"You know, I was developing."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"- I wonder if they have to have plausible deniability"
01:25:11;01:25:13;"that's like when they're like,"
01:25:13;01:25:15;"we're not saying that that definitely happened,"
01:25:15;01:25:19;"but here's like five articles that at least reported"
01:25:19;01:25:21;"at the time that, I don't know,"
01:25:21;01:25:24;"you performed Captain Jack for the first time"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"at the bar in Long Island, like whatever."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"So that is funny, this kind of like,"
01:25:28;01:25:29;"I'd love to do more research about this,"
01:25:29;01:25:31;"this idea of like a backdoor to being like,"
01:25:31;01:25:34;"like, oh, did you hear there's like an Elon Musk biopic?"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"And it's like, well, yeah, you know,"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"technically it's, they option the life rights"
01:25:38;01:25:41;"of his personal trainer, but you know,"
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Elon's in it like quite a bit,"
01:25:43;01:25:45;"but you know, it's really about the personal trainer."
01:25:45;01:25:47;"Like, is that how, okay, whatever."
01:25:47;01:25:50;"- But that is how it works."
01:25:50;01:25:53;"And I like this movie about Elon Musk's personal trainer."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"Let's option those life rights."
01:25:54;01:25:57;"- Let's get his personal trainer on the phone, Sid."
01:25:57;01:26:00;"Anyway, I can't wait for this Billy Joel biopic."
01:26:00;01:26:03;"I've always wondered how he became the piano man."
01:26:03;01:26:06;"That question is gonna definitely be answered"
01:26:06;01:26:09;"in this fascinating stuff."
01:26:09;01:26:12;"All right, now back to the top five."
01:26:12;01:26:16;"1969, the number five song this week"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"on the Billboard charts, 1969."
01:26:18;01:26:20;"The act is called Classics 4,"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"and the song is called Traces."

01:26:24;01:26:25;"Do you know this, Jake?"

01:26:27;01:26:30;"♪ Traces on a ♪"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"- So the band Classics was sued"

01:39:20;01:39:21;"- ""Thunder Thumbs""?"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"- You don't know Louis ""Thunder Thumbs"" Johnson?"
01:39:23;01:39:25;"- No, I don't know this ""Thunder Thumbs""."
01:39:25;01:39:27;"- He had a group with his brother"
01:39:27;01:39:29;"called the Brothers Johnson,"
01:39:29;01:39:30;"which you'd recognize some of their songs,"

01:39:34;01:39:36;"They had like kind of the bigger hit version"

01:39:38;01:39:41;"And you probably know their song ""Stomp""."
01:39:41;01:39:43;"But then he played on a lot of Michael Jackson stuff."
01:39:43;01:39:47;"'Cause he was like a go-to Quincy Jones bassist."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"- We can make the Quincy Jones biopic."
01:39:49;01:39:52;"I'm sure Rashida would be into this."
01:39:52;01:39:54;"We'd make the Quincy Jones biopic"
01:39:54;01:39:57;"but through licensing the life rights of ""Thunder Thumbs""."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"- Very interesting."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"She's like, ""What are you guys working on in there?"""
01:40:01;01:40:01;"""Nothing."""

01:40:05;01:40:06;"No."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"- I mean, you probably could make a cool"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"Louis Johnson biopic."
01:40:11;01:40:22;"Okay, so I guess I'm reading up on this."
01:40:22;01:40:26;"I guess Larry Graham brought slap bass into the mainstream"
01:40:26;01:40:30;"and right after him, Louis ""Thunder Thumbs"" Johnson"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"kind of took the mantle."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"So Drake's uncle gets the credit."
01:40:34;01:40:37;"Wait, real quick, throw on ""Stomp"" by the Brothers Johnson."
01:40:40;01:40:49;"- It's the guy that does it second."
01:40:49;01:40:52;"Who hits really big."
01:40:52;01:40:55;"- They're both considered the grandfather's of slap bass."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"- A race for the slap bass."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"That's a different biopic, maybe."
01:41:01;01:41:10;"- What year is this?"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"- Late 70s."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"- Late? - That's a good question though."
01:41:13;01:41:16;"- Well, I would have guessed like 73 or something."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"- Oh no, I'm wrong."
01:41:17;01:41:17;"Whoa."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"It was released February, 1980."
01:41:20;01:41:23;"It was recorded in '78, '79."

01:41:37;01:41:41;"you'd hear that it really sounds like the same era"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"as like ""Off the Wall."""
01:41:42;01:41:43;"- Yeah, no, I'm hearing it now."
01:41:43;01:41:47;"- It's like a little too tight for 73."
01:41:47;01:41:51;"- It's that like expensive sounding late 70s"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"leading into the 80s."
01:41:53;01:41:55;"- No, those like those string arrangements."
01:41:55;01:41:56;"(imitates drumming)"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"- Yeah, and some of those little scents."
01:41:58;01:42:07;"Thumbs of Thunder."

01:44:30;01:44:32;"- That's right, I would, yeah."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"- Broadcaster. - I would classify her."

01:44:41;01:44:43;"- They understand my struggle."
01:44:43;01:44:45;"- Dua Lipa has to tell her. - Not easy."
01:44:45;01:44:48;"- Press people that they need to release"
01:44:48;01:44:49;"an announcement saying,"
01:44:49;01:44:53;"""I am not Dua Lipa's not a friend of the show."""
01:44:53;01:44:56;"- I am unequivocally not a friend of the show."
01:44:56;01:44:58;"I would say that Elton John's a friend of the show"
01:44:58;01:45:02;"because I went on his Apple Music internet radio show."
01:45:02;01:45:05;"- You did? - So we're, yeah."
01:45:05;01:45:06;"- When?"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"- It was like Father of the Bride era."
01:45:08;01:45:09;"- 2019? - Okay."
01:45:09;01:45:10;"- Yeah, it was 2019."
01:45:10;01:45:12;"He couldn't have been nicer."
01:45:12;01:45:14;"- In person or phone?"
01:45:14;01:45:15;"- No, I was on the phone,"
01:45:15;01:45:20;"but first of all, he really did his homework."
01:45:20;01:45:22;"He clearly had some notes"
01:45:22;01:45:25;"and yeah, he had really nice things to say about the album."
01:45:25;01:45:26;"He said Father of the Bride"
01:45:26;01:45:29;"was his favorite album of the year so far."
01:45:29;01:45:32;"And I think I talked to him in June of that year."
01:45:32;01:45:35;"I meant to check in with him early the next year"
01:45:35;01:45:38;"and then due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I forgot about it."
01:45:38;01:45:43;"But I say, ""Hey Elton, I know a lot of time has passed."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"""Did that make it to the end?"""
01:45:45;01:45:47;"I have a bad feeling it didn't."
01:45:47;01:45:49;"He listens to a lot of music. - I mean, you can do it now."
01:45:49;01:45:52;"- Matt, can we get Elton John on the phone real quick?"
01:45:52;01:45:53;"- Right now?"
01:45:53;01:45:55;"- Yeah, let's see if he picks up."
01:45:55;01:45:57;"You know, he's probably sleeping."
01:45:57;01:45:59;"He's probably in a different time zone."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"- My understanding is that Elton John's show"
01:46:01;01:46:05;"is the longest running Apple Music show"
01:46:05;01:46:09;"and Time Crisis is only second to Elton John's show."
01:46:09;01:46:10;"Is that correct? - Is that true?"
01:46:10;01:46:11;"- Matt is shaking his head."
01:46:13;01:46:14;"Nobody knows. - I'm not gonna be able"
01:46:14;01:46:15;"to correct on that."
01:46:15;01:46:17;"- Okay, well, we're two of the longest running."
01:46:17;01:46:18;"- There you go."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"- One thing that stands out to me that he said,"
01:46:20;01:46:24;"which was tight, like he really listens to music."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"He really was familiar with the record"
01:46:26;01:46:29;"'cause at some point he said, ""I heard you're a father now."""
01:46:29;01:46:31;"And I said, ""Oh yeah, yeah, we had a baby last year."""
01:46:31;01:46:34;"And he goes, ""Is that what Bambina's about?"""
01:46:34;01:46:35;"(laughs)"
01:46:35;01:46:38;"And I was like, ""Oh, no, we actually."""
01:46:38;01:46:40;"Yeah, I didn't wanna get into the weeds on it."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"I was like, ""Well, yeah, no."""
01:46:41;01:46:43;"But no, but I wasn't thinking that."
01:46:43;01:46:45;"But anyway, shout out to Elton John."
01:46:45;01:46:46;"- That's tight."
01:46:46;01:46:48;"- Great guy. - Friend of the show."
01:46:48;01:46:49;"- Friend of the show."
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Now Elton John puts out a statement."
01:46:51;01:46:53;"He's like, ""Well, I reserve the right"
01:46:53;01:46:55;"""to call you a friend of the show, although I wouldn't now,"
01:46:55;01:46:58;"""but I'm certainly not a friend of your show."""
01:46:58;01:47:00;"How dare you?"
01:47:00;01:47:02;"- Joint statement from Dua Lipa and Elton John."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"(laughs)"
01:47:04;01:47:06;"- I've been in this business a long time, kid."
01:47:06;01:47:07;"(laughs)"
01:47:07;01:47:09;"- I mean, it's very, you know,"
01:47:09;01:47:10;"we could do something for them,"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"but they can do nothing for us."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"- Oh, you're thirsting more talking about fish?"
01:47:14;01:47:16;"- Very thirsting."
01:47:16;01:47:17;"- I'd love to revisit that, actually."
01:47:17;01:47:19;"I've thought a lot about,"
01:47:19;01:47:21;"that was an episode of ""Time Crisis"""
01:47:21;01:47:25;"that I really took back into my own week."
01:47:25;01:47:26;"You know, 'cause like sometimes we'll talk about some (beep)"
01:47:26;01:47:29;"like, you know, I'll promise that I'm gonna drink Folgers"
01:47:29;01:47:31;"for two weeks and I instantly forget about it."
01:47:31;01:47:32;"I'm not gonna forget this time."
01:47:32;01:47:35;"The next two weeks, I'm going hard on Folgers."
01:47:35;01:47:38;"But you know, like, just because I enjoy talking about it"
01:47:38;01:47:42;"with you guys, but you know, other people in my life,"
01:47:42;01:47:44;"it's not gonna come up where I'm gonna be like,"
01:47:44;01:47:45;"(laughs)"
01:47:45;01:47:48;"just like talking to some other friends or family"

01:47:58;01:47:59;"It's very unlikely to come up."
01:47:59;01:48:01;"- Not gonna come up."
01:48:01;01:48:02;"- Whereas there was something about thirsting more"
01:48:02;01:48:04;"talking about fish that actually,"
01:48:04;01:48:06;"I wanted to keep talking about it with people."
01:48:06;01:48:08;"You know, whether it's like talking with like a CT"
01:48:08;01:48:10;"who's like OG fish fan,"
01:48:10;01:48:13;"or just like other people I knew who maybe like"
01:48:13;01:48:16;"had met Thirst and More or Grateful Dead."
01:48:16;01:48:17;"That one just came up a lot."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"I thought about it a lot."
01:48:18;01:48:20;"Just like, hey, you guys, like just make a small,"
01:48:20;01:48:21;"like, you know about this?"
01:48:21;01:48:23;"Thirst and More, he kind of thought"
01:48:23;01:48:24;"that they were gonna be the next fish."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"And he kind of said this, did this weird interview."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"- Ezra, I love you being at a party"
01:48:29;01:48:32;"and people say, what's going on with you?"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"And you're like, you know, I saw this tweet from Folgers"
01:48:35;01:48:38;"and you know what, I've spent the last two weeks."
01:48:38;01:48:39;"Basically I'm gonna spend my two weeks,"
01:48:39;01:48:41;"just I'm gonna drink Folgers"
01:48:41;01:48:42;"and people are around the party like,"

01:48:49;01:48:51;"I was really taking their cursing."
01:48:51;01:48:52;"So you know what, I'm just gonna go,"
01:48:52;01:48:55;"I'm gonna just kind of exclusively drink Folgers"
01:48:55;01:48:56;"for the next two weeks."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"- I'll just never reference time crisis."
01:48:58;01:49:01;"I think that's what I should do when I meet new people"
01:49:01;01:49:03;"is if they're just like making small talk with me."
01:49:03;01:49:08;"I won't let them know that I have an internet radio show"
01:49:08;01:49:09;"that I do with you guys."
01:49:09;01:49:11;"I'll just like reference time crisis stuff,"
01:49:11;01:49:14;"but like no zero context."
01:49:14;01:49:16;"- Matt did a number crunch."
01:49:16;01:49:20;"TC and Elton John both started the same week, their shows,"

01:49:26;01:49:27;"- Wow, so we're tied with Elton John."
01:49:27;01:49:30;"- Yeah, there's another show called ""Soul Election"""
01:49:30;01:49:31;"hosted by Joe Kay,"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"but I put that in a slightly different category."
01:49:34;01:49:35;"- Interesting."
01:49:35;01:49:38;"I am just picturing like being at some kind of like"
01:49:38;01:49:41;"young urban professional hipster party"
01:49:41;01:49:43;"and people talking about coffee,"
01:49:43;01:49:45;"classic topic of conversation."
01:49:45;01:49:48;"People are just like, oh, I'm trying to drink less coffee."
01:49:48;01:49:49;"Or somebody saying,"
01:49:49;01:49:50;"what do you think is the best coffee in the neighborhood?"
01:49:50;01:49:51;"Or somebody saying,"
01:49:51;01:49:54;"how do you, do you go out for coffee in the morning?"
01:49:54;01:49:56;"Or do you, would you use a Mocha Master?"
01:49:56;01:49:57;"Do you use Nespresso Paws?"
01:49:57;01:49:59;"And I just pressed in just being like,"
01:49:59;01:50:01;"I was talking to my friend about,"
01:50:01;01:50:05;"and I kind of got it wrong on the Folgers claim"
01:50:05;01:50:06;"to New Orleans."
01:50:06;01:50:08;"So yeah, for me, I'm drinking Folgers now."
01:50:08;01:50:12;"(laughing)"
01:50:12;01:50:13;"Who the (beep) is this dude?"
01:50:13;01:50:14;"I'm just like, and they're like, what?"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"And I'm like, oh, I'm sorry."
01:50:16;01:50:17;"Maybe I didn't give you enough context."
01:50:17;01:50:19;"So I was talking with a group of my friends"
01:50:19;01:50:20;"about the new Folgers ad campaign."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"Oh, you know, I didn't even think about it."
01:50:22;01:50:24;"- It's causing like a Tim Robinson level."
01:50:24;01:50:25;"- I know, you know what's funny?"
01:50:25;01:50:26;"I didn't even think about it."
01:50:26;01:50:29;"I immediately started doing my bad Tim Robinson"
01:50:29;01:50:30;"impression because."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"- Yeah, it's that guy."
01:50:31;01:50:34;"- He's the king of the awkward guy at the party"
01:50:34;01:50:36;"who won't stop saying (beep) like that."
01:50:36;01:50:39;"Yeah, I probably should go to the supermarket"
01:50:39;01:50:41;"and stock up on more Folgers."
01:50:41;01:50:42;"- I'm worried if they're gonna sell out"
01:50:42;01:50:44;"because of this new ad campaign."
01:50:44;01:50:45;"(laughing)"
01:50:45;01:50:47;"- Yeah, Folgers says damn now."
01:50:47;01:50:51;"So yeah, I think a lot of younger people"
01:50:51;01:50:52;"are gonna get in the Folgers game,"
01:50:52;01:50:56;"probably gonna sell out in all the cool neighborhoods."
01:50:56;01:50:58;"And I got a little bit of egg on my face"
