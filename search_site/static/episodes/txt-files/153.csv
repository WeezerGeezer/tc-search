00:00;00:08;"Time Crisis back again. On this week's episode we're joined by multiple members"
00:08;00:13;"of the Longstreth Fidel household. We talk Olivia Rodrigo, Saab Rock,"
00:13;00:23;"Batdance, Batman, 1989, 2021 and much much more. This is a very deluxe episode of"
00:23;00:30;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:15;01:18;"Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:18;01:23;"I'm eating a Clif Bar here. Got to load up on nutrients after the gym."
01:23;01:25;"Is that your breakfast?"
01:25;01:31;"Kind of. I just was at the gym this morning because you're still in mountain time,"
01:31;01:32;"I'm assuming."
01:32;01:33;"I'm on deep mountain time."
01:33;01:36;"Yeah, you're in deep mountain time. So we're in different time zones."
01:36;01:38;"Mountains of Central Asia. We're in very different time zones."
01:38;01:44;"But this is the first food you've had today?"
01:44;01:49;"No, no, no, no. I had yogurt and granola early in the morning. Then I went to the gym."
01:49;01:51;"Are you still on kind granola?"
01:51;01:56;"I am on kind granola, plain Greek yogurt. And then went to the gym and now I'm wearing a really"
01:56;02:01;"sweaty Bruise It Budokan t-shirt, pounding water and eating a Clif Bar."
02:01;02:03;"What type of Clif Bar?"
02:03;02:03;"Chocolate chip."
02:03;02:08;"Really? What's your go-to Clif?"
02:08;02:13;"Well, I like the brand and I'm glad that somebody's still eating them because I feel like"
02:13;02:19;"they kind of were made to seem a little pass√©. They were a little ahead of their time and then"
02:19;02:23;"suddenly there's so many types of bars and Clif seems like a little 90s."
02:23;02:26;"Same way like power bars really fell off."
02:26;02:28;"I don't think Clif fell off, dude."
02:28;02:31;"I'm sure you're right. I'm sure Clif still has like huge market share."
02:31;02:33;"I just think it's it lost some of its swag."
02:33;02:36;"According to a very recent article."
02:36;02:37;"Yeah."
02:37;02:42;"2021 Clif Bar plans to double its sales and positive environmental impact."
02:42;02:46;"All right. It's probably like a Trump thing. Like coastal elites don't like it, but you know,"
02:46;02:47;"it's outperforming."
02:47;02:52;"Clif Bar CEO, Sally Grimes has unveiled a plan to double the company's sales to $2 billion."
02:52;02:55;"It's a lot of Clif Bars."
02:55;02:56;"I would have guessed there was more."
02:56;02:58;"Okay. I don't know what I'm talking about."
02:58;03:00;"I always liked apricot Clif Bars."
03:00;03:02;"They were a little tangy."
03:02;03:05;"I thought they were unique, but I never liked the chocolate chip ones."
03:05;03:08;"I'm just also picturing eating a chocolate chip Clif Bar in the morning"
03:08;03:10;"and feeling weird."
03:10;03:13;"But I guess if you're post-workout, you're in a different zone."
03:13;03:16;"Yeah. I'm not psyched on it, but it's just sort of a desperation move."
03:16;03:17;"That's what's around."
03:17;03:18;"Okay. Fair enough."
03:18;03:22;"We should also point out that another member of the"
03:23;03:25;"Longstreth Fidel household is in the building."
03:25;03:27;"Hannah, what's up?"
03:27;03:30;"Hey guys. How's it going?"
03:30;03:31;"Not bad. Thanks for joining us."
03:31;03:37;"I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am to be joining you today."
03:37;03:41;"Yeah. When's the last time you were on a time crisis?"
03:41;03:44;"Well, I was supposed to be on a few weeks ago and then I bailed."
03:44;03:44;"Right."
03:44;03:51;"My apologies. I have a day job and it got in the way."
03:51;03:52;"Fair enough."
03:52;03:55;"[Laughter]"
03:55;03:57;"But I think it was when a teacher came out."
03:57;03:58;"Oh, right. Yeah, of course."
03:58;04:01;"Congrats on all the huge success."
04:01;04:05;"Got that little TC bump. Next thing you know, it's the biggest show on Hulu."
04:05;04:08;"We're glad that we played a small part in that."
04:08;04:11;"Big part. Let's be honest."
04:11;04:17;"Well, we're very glad to have you back racking up those TC appearances."
04:17;04:21;"I'm sure you're definitely approaching being a top five TC guest at this point."
04:22;04:25;"We might as well jump right into it because I know you don't have all day."
04:25;04:32;"Initially, Jake said you wanted to come on because you wanted to discuss Olivia Rodrigo."
04:32;04:40;"And as Jake explained it, this is a huge album for you and your cohort of new 30 something mothers."
04:40;04:46;"I guess the first thing I wanted to know is like, how did that come about that?"
04:46;04:50;"Obviously, Olivia Rodrigo is like this massive new pop star."
04:50;04:54;"She's just big period. But how did she come to like sweep the moms group?"
04:54;05:03;"I wish that I had an answer for you. But I feel like with the way that pop music"
05:03;05:11;"sort of sinks into the cultural conversation, it's not like a definitive. This is the moment."
05:11;05:15;"Well, I guess there are some bands where that has happened. But for Olivia, it was more"
05:16;05:21;"like people I was hearing people talk about her. And then I think all of a sudden,"
05:21;05:29;"once the album came out, I I'd heard drivers license, but it didn't really click for me."
05:29;05:37;"And then once I heard that first song, brutal, I was like, Oh, this is an incredible album."
05:37;05:39;"Dare I say I'm obsessed with it."
05:39;05:41;"It's brutal out there."
05:43;05:47;"I did tell me about 15 times that she was obsessed."
05:47;05:51;"Obsessed with that. I was like, very hard for Jake to hear that you were obsessed with brutal,"
05:51;05:57;"because on the one hand, he loves the word brutal. And he doesn't like the word obsessed."
05:57;06:00;"No, I know it's overused in today's culture."
06:00;06:06;"I was listening. I was on my way to work. And I was listening to I guess it was that episode"
06:06;06:12;"of TC where Jake was saying that I use the word obsessed too much. So I"
06:12;06:15;"I didn't know you listen to the show."
06:15;06:18;"Yeah, sometimes I like to just jump in."
06:18;06:25;"You know, you tap in every once in a while. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. But I in this case,"
06:25;06:30;"I really do think I am someone obsessed. Actually. Yes."
06:31;06:37;"I'm so insecure. I think that I'll die before I drink. And I'm so caught up in the news of who"
06:37;06:42;"likes me and who hates you. And I'm so tired that I might quit my job, start a new life."
06:42;06:48;"And they'd all be so disappointed because who am I if not exploited? And I'm so sick of 17."
06:48;06:54;"I'm over this teenage dream. Someone tells me one more time. Enjoy your youth. I'm gonna cry."
06:54;07:00;"And I don't stick up for myself. I'm anxious and I think can help. And I wish I'd done this before."
07:00;07:02;"And I wish people liked me more."
07:02;07:07;"All I did was try my best. That's the kind of things I did. I'm relentlessly upset."
07:07;07:16;"They say these are the golden years, but I wish I could disappear. Ego crush is so severe. God,"
07:16;07:17;"it's brutal out here."
07:17;07:19;"I guess the first question I just want to clear up."
07:19;07:20;"Yeah."
07:20;07:27;"Is there causation or merely correlation with the fact that you and the new moms group"
07:27;07:30;"got obsessed as a group?"
07:30;07:30;"Yeah."
07:30;07:35;"Is it because you were new moms that you were in this zone? You brought life into the world. And"
07:35;07:41;"then you see this young woman bringing a classic album into the world and you're just like,"
07:41;07:45;"oh my God. Or is it just merely you happen to be talking to a bunch of new moms because you"
07:45;07:50;"got something to talk about. And the same way you would talk about any major news of the day"
07:50;07:54;"with whoever you're talking to, this happens to be the big album of the moment, which is it?"
07:54;07:57;"It's actually a two part answer."
07:57;07:58;"Great."
07:58;08:07;"I feel like for this group of 30 something women who have now very clearly entered midlife,"
08:07;08:15;"maybe it is about us all having some sort of midlife crisis post having a kid because her"
08:15;08:24;"music is so representative of a very specific time in one's life when heartbreak and first love and"
08:24;08:32;"trying to understand the way that the world works. There's something symbolic in that for sure."
08:32;08:37;"That it brings us back to the before as opposed to the now."
08:37;08:41;"It's interesting that you frame it that way because maybe there's also some kind of resonance"
08:41;08:49;"with first child experiencing a new type of love, thinking back to those early days of romantic"
08:49;08:52;"love. It's got to be some connection."
08:52;09:02;"Yeah, for sure. But at the same time, I can't remember an album genuinely that people were"
09:02;09:07;"continuously saying, oh my God, have you heard it? It's so good."
09:07;09:13;"Right. Especially when you enter your 30s, unless like, I mean, I guess working in music,"
09:13;09:18;"you're more likely to get people saying like that just for the hell of it because it's their job."
09:21;09:27;"I worked on it. You work in the arts, obviously, it's not a million miles away. But"
09:27;09:33;"yeah, I think generally like in your 30s or even by your mid to late 20s."
09:33;09:37;"How often are multiple people being like, have you heard this album?"
09:37;09:40;"It's maybe like once every five years."
09:40;09:44;"And also just to get the lay of the land with your kind of like,"
09:44;09:50;"your group of friends and your milieu. I mean, I know Jake's probably like hitting you sometimes"
09:50;09:54;"with albums and stuff, but in terms of like your friends and..."
09:54;09:56;"Sort of."
09:56;10:02;"But actually, Jake, when's the last time you hit Hannah with like,"
10:02;10:04;"have you heard this new album? You've got to check it out."
10:04;10:08;"I have a memory of driving out to the desert and playing her the Young Gov"
10:08;10:10;"double album that came out last year."
10:10;10:12;"Oh yeah, you were riding hard for that."
10:12;10:15;"I love Young Gov. I might've played you the second grade album too."
10:15;10:19;"I think I played you the second grade album, which is my favorite album of the last year."
10:20;10:24;"Yeah, you've been riding for second grade. Jake, after we recorded the last episode,"
10:24;10:28;"you were pretty hyped on the new BTS song. Did that make it back home?"
10:28;10:31;"That did not make it back home. I hope it's on the top five this week."
10:31;10:36;"I hope it's on the top five this week. I want to hear it again."
10:37;10:41;"She loves"
10:41;10:47;"Riding right up to me and telling me that I'm her one"
10:47;10:49;"'Cause she's gay"
10:49;10:59;"She loves"
10:59;11:05;"Riding right up to me and giving me big kiss"
11:06;11:07;"Just like this"
11:07;11:17;"She loves me, never said she told me I've been bang, bang, bang, bang"
11:17;11:18;"Shooting from the head"
11:18;11:22;"So back to more like your friends, your professional colleagues."
11:22;11:23;"Yeah."
11:23;11:26;"Are you getting lots of texts when a new Taylor Swift album comes out?"
11:26;11:28;"Is folklore a big deal?"
11:28;11:29;"No, not at all."
11:29;11:35;"I think it's fair to say this is the only album that has been discussed on your friend thread."
11:35;11:36;"Correct. Yeah."
11:36;11:40;"So this is like taking you back to like high school college days when albums would come out."
11:40;11:40;"Oh, for sure."
11:40;11:45;"Really? People would be like, ""Oh, did you hear Interpol?"" Like that kind of vibe."
11:45;11:51;"Yes. And I'm sure that I had that exact conversation."
11:51;11:52;"Okay."
11:52;11:53;"About Interpol."
11:53;12:00;"So this is like the first Interpol record for 2021, new month."
12:00;12:00;"Yes."
12:00;12:02;"Okay. So I really am starting to understand that this is not,"
12:02;12:05;"it's not merely this album connected with you."
12:05;12:11;"It's not even merely that this is your first album you got into seriously since becoming a mom."
12:11;12:12;"This is like bigger."
12:12;12:19;"This is a, almost a once a decade phenomenon that happened to coincide also with a major time in your life."
12:19;12:20;"Yes."
12:20;12:21;"Okay. That's deep. That's deep."
12:21;12:22;"Yeah, for sure."
12:22;12:27;"And you found that this was true across the board with the new moms."
12:27;12:29;"Were there any new moms on there who are just like,"
12:29;12:35;"""I'm a classic rock fan. I'm not into this pop. Please stop clogging up my texts."""
12:35;12:37;"Talking about Olivia Rodrigo. Was everybody in?"
12:37;12:42;"Everyone was in. Everyone was talking about the gossip and the love triangle that was going on."
12:42;12:49;"That's the backstory of the record. But then like on another text thread with old friends from New"
12:49;12:52;"York, some of whom are still single and childless."
12:52;12:57;"You make it sound so bleak."
12:57;12:57;"I know."
12:58;13:00;"Or they're living their best life."
13:00;13:01;"They might not want kids."
13:01;13:02;"Yeah, exactly."
13:02;13:03;"Yeah."
13:03;13:04;"What they want is a great album."
13:04;13:10;"I think you meant the term childless in a value neutral way."
13:10;13:15;"But for some reason the word childless, it has like an intense-"
13:15;13:17;"I know. I realized what it's like as it came out of my mouth."
13:17;13:19;"It has like an intense valence to it."
13:19;13:19;"Yeah."
13:19;13:20;"Anyway."
13:20;13:21;"Yeah."
13:21;13:22;"The New York friends."
13:22;13:25;"Yeah. The New York friends. They're all into it too."
13:26;13:33;"I feel like maybe it is just a nostalgia for being 19, 20, 18. I don't know."
13:33;13:40;"But there's something really special about it. And I feel like it's not- I mean, obviously,"
13:40;13:48;"it's a huge- this is not breaking news. It's like a huge hit that spans other age ranges."
13:49;13:56;"But I was on set the other night and these two PAs, I just overheard them"
13:56;14:04;"just like casually having a conversation about how much they love the LVR Rodrigo album."
14:04;14:04;"Wow."
14:04;14:11;"And it like really brought us together in a way. Because I'm not necessarily on set going to"
14:11;14:15;"like have a conversation with the two PAs. But I-"
14:15;14:17;"Right. You're the director. You're real busy."
14:17;14:22;"Yeah. But like, I sort of turned around and then we got into a whole discussion about how we were"
14:22;14:31;"all obsessed with the album. And these are girls that are, I don't know, and they're probably 25."
14:31;14:35;"And these PAs are now the first AD in the cinematographer."
14:35;14:36;"Yeah, exactly."
14:36;14:41;"Ladies, I like the cut of your gyps. Come with me."
14:43;14:48;"Okay, so this LVR Rodrigo album, this really is like the first Interpol album or the first"
14:48;14:53;"Strokes album or something. It's just like the f*** talk of the town. Clearly not a flash in"
14:53;14:57;"the pan because now at this point, it's been out for a few months. Just uniting people,"
14:57;15:03;"different ages, people with child, people without child, all the different demos."
15:04;15:14;"Our Gaga for Rodrigo. And so I see in our notes, I guess in the pre-interview,"
15:14;15:18;"we heard that you also wanted to discuss John Mayer. So I know John Mayer's a new album. I"
15:18;15:22;"have not heard it. Is this album also the talk of the town?"
15:22;15:24;"It's the talk of our house."
15:24;15:26;"Oh, okay. Jake, you're a big fan too?"
15:26;15:33;"Not a fan, but it's interesting. I feel like it's been discussed on like the Richard Pictures,"
15:33;15:40;"Mountain Brews, Text Thread. I've seen it, at least on my timeline, I see it referenced a"
15:40;15:41;"fair amount."
15:41;15:44;"You find it interesting you're not in, Jake?"
15:44;15:50;"No, I was very excited about it conceptually. Have you seen the cover of it?"
15:50;15:52;"We're fans of John Mayer."
15:52;15:53;"Of Mayer."
15:53;15:56;"Yeah. Him as a personality."
15:56;15:56;"Right."
15:56;15:58;"Yeah. He seems like a fun guy."
15:58;15:59;"Yeah."
16:01;16:03;"And obviously he's playing with the dead."
16:03;16:08;"Of course. That's the only time I've ever seen him perform. And yeah, he's made some classic"
16:08;16:15;"music. The Continuum album. There's songs on that album I still throw on. But wait, are you in on"
16:15;16:19;"this album, Hannah? Or you're just like, you're always fascinated when he drops a new record?"
16:19;16:27;"There was a long period where I did not give a s*** about John Mayer's music. It went from"
16:27;16:35;"Your Body is a Wonderland to New Light with nothing in between. And then when I heard"
16:35;16:40;"that song New Light, I forget when it came out. It was maybe a few years ago."
16:40;16:43;"It came out in 2018, I think. That sounds right."
16:43;16:48;"Yeah. It blew my mind. I was like, whoa, he's doing some interesting stuff."
16:48;16:56;"It sounds great. I love listening to this in the car. And I like what he's doing. And then"
16:56;17:03;"the album came out and there's some bangers on it. But then there's like, I think track two"
17:03;17:07;"to me sounds just like a Tim McGraw song without the country twin."
17:07;17:11;"Is it a concept album? It's like it kind of has this 80s-ish cover."
17:11;17:20;"It's a concept album, kind of about a concept album, if that makes sense. He's like, he's so"
17:20;17:28;"into the concept of making a concept album that I think it overrides the songs."
17:28;17:33;"It's like a rock opera about a struggling singer-songwriter in the 80s who wants to"
17:33;17:40;"write a concept album really badly. Interesting."
17:40;17:44;"But I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it."
17:44;17:48;"No, I definitely got to listen to it. I mean, well, my question for you guys is the title"
17:48;17:55;"caught my eye. I saw some billboards for it. Sob Rock. What does that mean? Is that evocative"
17:55;17:57;"of the music? Is it like sad rock?"
17:57;18:02;"I thought of it as a play on soft rock. It's almost like you are saying soft rock, but"
18:02;18:03;"you're saying sob rock."
18:03;18:12;"Is it also like the car? Is it like sob like S-A-A-B-B like you listen to it?"
18:12;18:13;"That's actually a good interpretation."
18:14;18:20;"I feel like his character would the character that John is playing in this concept album"
18:20;18:21;"would try to sob."
18:21;18:25;"I had read about the record before it came out and I was very excited about it. I saw"
18:25;18:31;"the cover. I love the cover. And he said in a press release that he wanted to make a record"
18:31;18:37;"as if it were 1988 and the album had been lost and just shelved and had just been recently"
18:37;18:44;"rediscovered. And I was like, ""Damn, that sounds really intriguing. I really hope he"
18:44;18:45;"goes the full nine with that."""
18:45;18:49;"Now, the first song, it does sound like a-"
18:49;18:53;"'88. What's he going for with '88? Like Richard Marks?"
18:53;18:56;"No, that's not like power ballads. I wish there was... Actually, I thought of Richard"
18:56;19:00;"Marks yesterday when I was listening to it. I was like, ""Man, I wish there was just"
19:00;19:04;"balls to the wall like Richard Marks' power ballad."" No, I think it was more of like a"
19:04;19:07;"Steve Wynwood, ""Back in the High Life Again"" kind of thing."
19:07;19:09;"Okay. Well, that's a great reference."
19:09;19:13;"And the first song, he brings it with that. And then the rest of the album, he just"
19:13;19:20;"completely stops doing the '80s thing. He could have gone so far with the meticulous"
19:20;19:25;"dedication to recreating and exploring the '80s aesthetic. And it was weird. I actually"
19:25;19:31;"read the Pitchfork review, which I never do, Hannah's suggestion. In the review, it said"
19:32;19:37;"well, they were not thrilled with the record, but I was surprised that the writer was like,"
19:37;19:42;"""Yeah, he really nailed the '80s sound."" And I'm like, ""He barely even scratched the"
19:42;19:48;"surface."" The drum sounds on the rest of the record are completely just innocuous drum"
19:48;19:54;"sounds from the last 10 or 15 years. There's some '80s attack a little bit on some of the"
19:54;19:57;"solos, but it's such a mild record."
19:57;20:04;"Which to me feels so counter to his personality, which is sort of the bummer of it."
20:04;20:06;"Well, yeah, there's none of his personality."
20:06;20:14;"Well, 'cause he's known to be kind of meticulous. His records have very clean"
20:14;20:21;"sounding, the playing's very precise. He's like a watch guy too. So watch guys know a lot of"
20:21;20:22;"details."
20:22;20:23;"You know?"
20:23;20:26;"Like wrist watches?"
20:26;20:27;"Yeah, he's a wrist watch guy. You didn't know that?"
20:27;20:29;"He's known for that?"
20:29;20:30;"Oh yeah."
20:30;20:30;"Okay."
20:30;20:31;"Everybody knows that."
20:31;20:34;"Like he's into vintage Rolexes?"
20:34;20:37;"Yeah, exactly. Seinfeld's nodding his head, ""Yes, you knew this, right Seinfeld? He's a watch guy."""
20:37;20:42;"Yeah, I feel like this is one of his major traits is that he collects watches in addition to"
20:42;20:49;"Japanese streetwear and sartorial other things, but watches, yeah."
20:49;20:53;"I guarantee John Mayer, if you just asked him, if you named two years of"
20:54;21:00;"the Rolex Submariner and be like, ""Did they change anything between '93 and '75?"""
21:00;21:02;"He'd be like, ""Oh, where do I start?"""
21:02;21:05;"He'd be like, ""Boom, boom, boom, boom."""
21:05;21:06;"Yeah."
21:06;21:13;"But is it in... I'm so curious. I've thought about this before. Just what is it about watches that"
21:13;21:19;"gets people excited? Is it in the... 'Cause the technology of a watch is the same across the"
21:19;21:23;"board. So it's just in the aesthetic and the play of it?"
21:23;21:29;"No, it's the masterfulness. There's very few master crafts, right? It's like the same people"
21:29;21:36;"that get very into whiskey, watches, cars. It's much more about how refined and yeah."
21:36;21:41;"And what Nick just named whiskey, watches, and cars, I know this from my dear friends"
21:41;21:45;"in Chromio 'cause they're obsessed with this. Those things are known as the deluxe life"
21:45;21:47;"or the deluxe lifestyle."
21:47;21:49;"Those three?"
21:49;21:51;"Yeah, there's other things, but also guitars."
21:51;21:57;"If you're into guitars, whiskey, watches, and cars, you're into the deluxe life."
21:57;22:00;"This is a real phenomenon."
22:00;22:01;"Wow, I'm not into any of that stuff."
22:01;22:07;"Well, hold on, Jake. You're into at least half of it. You like whiskey and guitars."
22:07;22:12;"It's true. I do like whiskey and guitars, but I'm not a connoisseur or collector."
22:12;22:16;"We'll get you there. 10 years, you're gonna be full deluxe life."
22:16;22:19;"Jake owns like 90 guitars."
22:19;22:21;"[laughter]"
22:21;22:28;"I need to rent a storage space, offsite storage with climate control to store all my guitars"
22:28;22:29;"that I never touch."
22:29;22:35;"This old guitar taught me to sing a love song."
22:35;22:40;"Showed me how to laugh and how to cry."
22:40;22:49;"It introduced me to some friends of mine and brightened up some days."
22:49;22:55;"It helped me make it through some lonely nights."
22:55;23:01;"Whoa, what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night."
23:01;23:09;"I think the love of watches is it does come from a place where they're not really all the same."
23:09;23:10;"Yeah."
23:10;23:13;"It is amazing the craftsmanship that goes into them."
23:13;23:18;"The really high-end watches, these tiny little gears moving."
23:18;23:22;"There are people who appreciate what they call complications."
23:23;23:26;"There's some interesting stuff that I've read about in the 19th century,"
23:26;23:34;"people would commission some kind of a pocket watch that would be able to tell you the day,"
23:34;23:37;"the date, show you what stars were out."
23:37;23:39;"That was really cutting edge technology then."
23:39;23:44;"That would be like a guy in Switzerland dedicating five years of his life to make you something."
23:44;23:47;"Yeah, there's the craftsmanship element."
23:47;23:51;"And then I guess it's just like with anything, where if you get obsessed enough with something,"
23:51;23:55;"you start to really care about the years, the history, why it's different."
23:55;23:59;"And there, it's just a matter of taste, I guess, if you're interested in watches or not."
23:59;24:06;"But I think John Mayer used to write a column for this watch website called Hodinkee.com."
24:06;24:07;"Hodinkee?"
24:07;24:08;"Yeah."
24:08;24:10;"Do you have some watches, Ezra?"
24:10;24:11;"Yeah, I have a few."
24:11;24:14;"I feel like you're like low-key watch guy."
24:14;24:19;"I'm a low-key watch guy because I've known some hardcore watch guys in my life."
24:19;24:22;"And their enthusiasm can be infectious."
24:22;24:30;"I have some sense of the sociology of the Rolexes, who buys which ones, what they mean."
24:30;24:34;"I'm almost more interested in that than wearing them myself."
24:34;24:41;"But there's a whole thing with watches where there's this one, like a Rolex Submariner,"
24:41;24:43;"that's a very classic one."
24:43;24:46;"And it was originally made for the Jacques Cousteau type dudes,"
24:46;24:48;"because it can go underwater and all this stuff."
24:48;24:52;"But then it kind of became really popular almost with like eye bankers."
24:52;24:57;"And then some other watch heads started to derisively refer to those guys as desk divers."
24:57;25:01;"Like, all right, you're sitting at your desk with your Submariner."
25:01;25:02;"All right, whatever, man."
25:02;25:06;"You know, it's almost like the same with outdoor hiking gear."
25:06;25:08;"It's a whole weird world."
25:08;25:13;"Or like big SUVs you could take off-road, but you never do."
25:13;25:14;"Yeah, exactly."
25:14;25:18;"There's definitely some desk divers out there who have some crazy SUV that's like,"
25:18;25:20;"never seen dirt in its life."
25:20;25:21;"Yeah."
25:21;25:23;"I have one very good friend who..."
25:23;25:25;"Is a desk diver?"
25:25;25:27;"Does not keep... is a desk diver."
25:27;25:28;"I have a few friends who are desk divers."
25:28;25:31;"I have one very good friend who doesn't have..."
25:31;25:35;"He doesn't keep any money in the bank or stock market."
25:35;25:35;"Wow."
25:35;25:39;"He put all of his money into watches, and he keeps the watches in his house."
25:39;25:46;"And he has an app on his phone that sort of hourly says how the watches have raised an investment."
25:46;25:51;"It's essentially his life savings and investment is in these watches, and he flips them."
25:51;25:52;"Oh my God."
25:52;25:53;"What if he gets robbed?"
25:53;25:57;"Trust me, it's a thing that I talk to him a lot about."
25:57;25:57;"Yeah."
25:57;25:59;"I mean, it's like..."
25:59;26:04;"We had another friend who was house sitting, and that was all he could think about the entire time"
26:04;26:06;"when he went out of town for a few months."
26:06;26:09;"Another friend has to... he's like, ""I can't be in this house with this."""
26:09;26:11;"You got to put those in a bank vault."
26:11;26:13;"Yeah, why don't you put them in a safety box?"
26:13;26:18;"Because... and he probably does keep some, but because he's like,"
26:18;26:21;"""I think that there's real value here,"" but he can also enjoy it."
26:21;26:25;"So where you keep your money in the market and you can't enjoy it,"
26:25;26:27;"he gets to wear these watches and they increase in value."
26:27;26:29;"He's also been doing the same with cars."
26:29;26:30;"So he's wearing them?"
26:30;26:31;"Yes."
26:31;26:32;"All of them."
26:32;26:33;"All of them at once."
26:33;26:35;"No."
26:35;26:37;"What are you doing, bro?"
26:37;26:42;"Wait, Nick, you don't have to say if not, but is this friend John Mayer?"
26:42;26:45;"His friend is John Mayer."
26:45;26:46;"No, although I'm guessing John Mayer has the same..."
26:46;26:48;"He's actually a cool guy just put out a new album."
26:48;26:49;"It's called Saabrock."
26:49;26:50;"I can't say who."
26:50;26:52;"Well, I mean, Jake, you know..."
26:52;26:54;"These are like five figure."
26:54;26:56;"Yeah, he'll buy a watch."
26:56;26:57;"I'm sure some of them could be six figure."
26:57;26:58;"Yeah."
26:58;26:59;"The really rare ones."
26:59;27:02;"I know he went to Japan and he said he got a watch."
27:02;27:06;"And I mean, this is crazy to me, but he's like, ""I would have spent like $35,000 on that watch."""
27:06;27:11;"And as soon as I got back, it was $150,000 and I sold it."
27:11;27:12;"Whoa."
27:12;27:13;"And then I flipped it into that."
27:13;27:13;"Yeah."
27:13;27:14;"I mean, there's like..."
27:14;27:15;"That's crazy."
27:15;27:15;"So then what are you..."
27:15;27:16;"There's like this..."
27:16;27:18;"I will say I had another..."
27:18;27:21;"I was hanging out before I moved with my neighbor who collects whiskey."
27:21;27:23;"And he does a similar thing with whiskey."
27:23;27:27;"And he was like, especially post-COVID, it seems,"
27:27;27:33;"there's this whole master craft commodity thing where it's like being a master"
27:33;27:35;"at one of these like very technical..."
27:35;27:37;"The whiskey..."
27:37;27:39;"The deluxe life stuff is very..."
27:39;27:40;"It's a diminishing..."
27:40;27:44;"Basically, people are valuing the amount of time it takes to make this stuff."
27:44;27:46;"So if you collect it, there's this..."
27:46;27:50;"You're finding a lot of people who are like buying and flipping."
27:50;27:53;"It's an entire essentially market."
27:53;27:57;"It's a commodities market for deluxe life."
27:57;27:58;"Yeah."
27:58;27:59;"And so his thing was..."
27:59;28:00;"Wait, because there's like a..."
28:00;28:04;"There's a master whiskey maker somewhere who does like four bottles a year?"
28:04;28:05;"Yeah."
28:05;28:08;"Like a Pappy Van Winkle can be..."
28:08;28:14;"At this point, you could have bought it for $120 10 years ago."
28:14;28:15;"And now it's like $3,000."
28:15;28:18;"Are they drinking that?"
28:18;28:21;"Wait, I've heard this name before."
28:21;28:23;"What the f*** is Pappy Van Winkle?"
28:23;28:26;"I've never heard that name in my life."
28:26;28:31;"Pappy Van Winkle is a very high-end whiskey where it's a very small batch."
28:31;28:32;"It's a family batch."
28:32;28:33;"I know..."
28:33;28:34;"American?"
28:34;28:34;"Oh, God."
28:34;28:35;"It's American, Kentucky."
28:35;28:37;"It does sound like..."
28:37;28:40;"It sounds a little bit like..."
28:40;28:41;"Which we'll talk about later."
28:41;28:43;"It sounds a little bit like a ""I think you should leave now"" sketch."
28:43;28:45;"Can you just picture like Tim Robinson just be like,"
28:45;28:50;"""It's called Pappy Van Winkle. It costs $50,000 a bottle. Are you f***ing stupid?"
28:50;28:52;"It's Pappy Van Winkle."""
28:52;28:54;"Okay, but Pappy Van Winkle is real."
28:54;28:56;"Yeah, it's real."
28:56;28:57;"It's a Kentucky family."
28:57;28:58;"Is he real?"
28:58;29:01;"My understanding is that he was real."
29:01;29:06;"I used to know a lot more about it, but I'm looking at it now and you're seeing bottles that are"
29:06;29:12;"seven $10,000 bottles, probably up to $20,000 bottles."
29:12;29:12;"What the hell?"
29:12;29:16;"My story about this..."
29:16;29:21;"The reason I know about Pappy Van Winkle is I made a pilot years ago,"
29:21;29:24;"like right before, right around when we had Max."
29:24;29:28;"I really fought hard to have this director shoot this pilot."
29:28;29:31;"No one wanted me to have this director shoot this pilot."
29:31;29:31;"I'm really far from him."
29:31;29:35;"I didn't know him, but I really liked these music videos he'd made."
29:35;29:37;"And everyone's like, ""You shouldn't. I don't know about him."""
29:37;29:38;"I said, ""No, no, I believe in him."""
29:38;29:40;"And it was the worst experience I ever had."
29:40;29:43;"He was the biggest piece of s***."
29:43;29:45;"He made my life absolutely hell."
29:45;29:47;"It was a truly awful experience."
29:47;29:50;"And at the end of this horrific..."
29:50;29:54;"And I've been pretty lucky to really enjoy the people I work with."
29:54;29:55;"This really left a mark on me."
29:55;30:00;"And he bought me this bottle of Pappy Van Winkle as a gift,"
30:00;30:01;"which I knew was expensive."
30:01;30:02;"It was probably a couple hundred dollars at the time."
30:02;30:04;"And then it just sort of sat on my..."
30:04;30:07;"I couldn't really look at it because it just reminded me of this guy."
30:07;30:10;"And I remember at some point, someone was like,"
30:10;30:13;"""You know, that bottle now is probably like $700."""
30:13;30:16;"-Oh my God. -And I was like, ""What?"""
30:16;30:17;"And I was like, ""What?"""
30:17;30:19;"And I was like, I looked at that bottle."
30:19;30:20;"And now I'm looking at it."
30:20;30:22;"It's probably about a four or $5,000 bottle now."
30:22;30:24;"-Oh my God. -And I remember..."
30:24;30:26;"And I remember taking that bottle out and saying,"
30:26;30:28;"""You know what? Let's just drink this."""
30:28;30:31;"And going out with some friends and sitting in a hot tub"
30:31;30:34;"and just drinking it out of the bottle and finishing the whole bottle."
30:34;30:36;"-Jesus. -And basically,"
30:36;30:37;"because I was like, I don't like having..."
30:37;30:39;"It was almost out of spite."
30:39;30:40;"You know, I didn't even enjoy it."
30:40;30:42;"I just didn't want to look at the bottle anymore"
30:42;30:44;"because it reminded me of this person."
30:44;30:47;"And I look back now, I was like, ""That was so stupid."""
30:47;30:49;"I mean, it was so stupid."
30:49;30:54;"But yeah, I just pounded this bottle of what is now one of the most expensive"
30:54;30:56;"because that's at least 10 years old now."
30:56;30:56;"Wow."
30:56;31:01;"And so, but to answer your question, Jake, do people drink it?"
31:01;31:03;"My next door neighbor who collects whiskey basically was like,"
31:03;31:07;"""I want to turn this hobby of mine and this thing that I love,"
31:07;31:10;"which is drinking whiskey, into essentially a..."""
31:10;31:12;"-Retirement. -If not a cost..."
31:12;31:13;"No, not a retirement."
31:13;31:18;"If not a cost because he's not trying to wealth hoard his whiskey."
31:18;31:21;"And it's different than the watches in that when you drink the whiskey,"
31:21;31:23;"the value plummets to zero."
31:23;31:24;"Yeah, there's something."
31:24;31:27;"He was like, ""I want to turn this..."""
31:27;31:29;"And I thought this was kind of cool."
31:29;31:32;"He was like, ""I want to turn this into, if not a cost negative,"
31:32;31:36;"just a true, just like I get to drink a bottle, I flip a bottle."""
31:36;31:38;"You know, basically it just, it evens out."
31:38;31:39;"Break even?"
31:39;31:41;"He breaks even on something he really loves."
31:41;31:44;"So he'll buy two bottles of extensive whiskey,"
31:44;31:48;"one he'll then flip into another and he just gets to have..."
31:48;31:51;"And I mean, he has like 70 bottles of whiskey in this."
31:52;31:55;"Again, it's like Mayer with the watches or whatever."
31:55;32:00;"But I'm sure Mayer has this app on his phone that tells him his collection"
32:00;32:04;"and it's like market value, like, you know, like the stock market."
32:04;32:06;"I mean, here's a question."
32:06;32:09;"It's like you have your buddy that has all his wealth,"
32:09;32:10;"all his money stored in watches."
32:10;32:12;"It's like how liquid is a watch?"
32:12;32:17;"Like if he wanted to sell one of his watches like today, he could do it."
32:17;32:18;"That's what I'm saying."
32:18;32:21;"My understanding, and this was news to me..."
32:21;32:21;"Really?"
32:21;32:24;"Is that he could sell it in minutes."
32:24;32:28;"And I guess the good news is if war breaks out,"
32:28;32:30;"grab that suitcase full of watches,"
32:30;32:35;"you end up in Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, France, whatever."
32:35;32:37;"You're going to be able to sell those Rolexes."
32:37;32:38;"No problem."
32:38;32:40;"Now, how stable is the watch market?"
32:40;32:41;"Do the prices fluctuate?"
32:41;32:45;"I mean, we can have him on to talk about it."
32:45;32:46;"I'm just curious."
32:46;32:47;"Like it's like a market."
32:47;32:48;"I don't know if it's like..."
32:49;32:52;"This is the thing is I think if you know what you're doing,"
32:52;32:54;"you know you're buying either like a rare watch"
32:54;32:56;"or you're buying one that you know will become..."
32:56;32:58;"I think that there's a thought."
32:58;33:00;"You don't just go buy an expensive watch, right?"
33:00;33:02;"And this is what I think the Chromio guys know."
33:02;33:04;"It's like if you know, then you know."
33:04;33:08;"And truly it's like they're these classic brands"
33:08;33:11;"that it's like these guys are not betting on some up and coming bulls**t."
33:11;33:15;"It's like there's certain watches that are just so beloved"
33:15;33:16;"that if you..."
33:16;33:18;"Same with guitars kind of."
33:18;33:23;"Like if you have a f**king whatever Rolex Day-Date from this year"
33:23;33:25;"or Audemars Piguet or whatever,"
33:25;33:29;"they're pretty evergreen or they've proven to be so far."
33:29;33:34;"Okay, it sounds like we got to line up a watch guy, whiskey guy."
33:34;33:37;"We actually have had a car guy on the show before."
33:37;33:38;"That's true."
33:38;33:42;"But we could do watch guy, whiskey guy, vintage guitar guy"
33:42;33:45;"and maybe bring back the car guy"
33:45;33:46;"and we're going to do Deluxe Life December."
33:47;33:50;"I love this idea."
33:50;33:50;"And also it'll be..."
33:50;33:52;"Just in time for Christmas."
33:52;33:56;"Very relatable content for any of our billionaire listeners."
33:56;33:57;"Yeah."
33:57;34:00;"We pick up in New York City"
34:00;34:04;"I'm trying to find the man I never got to be"
34:04;34:11;"But when I push down on the pavement"
34:11;34:15;"I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed"
34:15;34:23;"The only deal I ever signed"
34:23;34:26;"No devil drew a dotted line"
34:26;34:27;"The stage was set"
34:27;34:29;"The words were mine"
34:29;34:30;"I'm not complaining"
34:30;34:34;"Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey"
34:34;34:37;"Water, water, water"
34:37;34:38;"Sleep"
34:38;34:45;"Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey"
34:45;34:49;"Wake up, shake it off and repeat"
34:49;34:55;"It's just a phase"
34:56;34:58;"It's not forever"
34:58;35:00;"It's just a phase"
35:00;35:05;"But I still might have a ways to go"
35:05;35:08;"Guys, I got to run in about 10 minutes"
35:08;35:09;"and I got to tell you"
35:09;35:12;"I'm itching to see Jake's reaction to this."
35:12;35:12;"Travis Scott."
35:12;35:13;"All right."
35:13;35:14;"Hold on. Let me grab it."
35:14;35:15;"So what is this?"
35:15;35:16;"Oh yeah."
35:16;35:23;"So Travis Scott has a spiked seltzer that came out a few months ago."
35:24;35:26;"Yeah, it's a 7% volume, right?"
35:26;35:27;"There's Hannah holding it up."
35:27;35:28;"It's called Cacti"
35:28;35:34;"and it's alcohol infused agave seltzer."
35:34;35:36;"7% alcohol volume."
35:36;35:38;"It's 11 o'clock in the morning"
35:38;35:48;"and I just, I managed to come across some of this hard to find cacti drink"
35:48;35:51;"and it just felt like, you know,"
35:51;35:55;"Jake with his history of worst margaritas and all the rest of it,"
35:55;35:59;"something that would be interesting to get his candid reaction to."
35:59;36:02;"And also let's not forget Jake, a guy who I think"
36:02;36:05;"merely a year ago said to us on this very program,"
36:05;36:06;"""Wait, who's Travis Scott?"""
36:06;36:12;"So we know Jake's not going to bring a lot of cultural baggage to this."
36:12;36:17;"He can objectively judge this beverage as a beverage."
36:17;36:21;"Cacti, pineapple, agave spiked seltzer."
36:21;36:22;"Oh, you got a different flavor than me?"
36:22;36:23;"Yeah."
36:23;36:24;"What do you have?"
36:24;36:26;"Seinfeld, I appreciate you dropping these off."
36:26;36:28;"I saw them when I got to my office."
36:28;36:29;"So yeah, my pleasure."
36:29;36:31;"For context, just for our listeners,"
36:31;36:35;"I live like a block away from where Jake works."
36:35;36:35;"Yep, it's true."
36:35;36:39;"So I was able to swing by and just leave a bag with a couple of flavors."
36:39;36:41;"I think there was also pineapple."
36:41;36:41;"What was it?"
36:41;36:42;"Strawberry and pineapple."
36:42;36:43;"What do you have?"
36:43;36:44;"What do you have, Hannah?"
36:44;36:46;"I have the strawberry."
36:46;36:48;"All right, here we go."
36:48;36:50;"I'm going to crack that open."
36:50;36:52;"A morning cacti."
36:52;36:53;"The way Travis intended."
36:53;36:57;"Hannah does not look pleased."
36:57;36:59;"What'd you take a second sip?"
36:59;37:00;"It's real trebly."
37:00;37:04;"It's going straight to the head."
37:04;37:09;"I'll take two more sips."
37:09;37:11;"It doesn't taste like strawberry to me."
37:11;37:12;"It's all high end."
37:12;37:14;"Is it sweet?"
37:14;37:16;"It's like weak Sprite."
37:16;37:18;"Is it hard?"
37:18;37:19;"Can you taste the alcohol?"
37:20;37:22;"It's got a real terrible metallic aftertaste."
37:22;37:23;"Yeah, it does."
37:23;37:26;"Are you trying it too, Seinfeld?"
37:26;37:28;"Seinfeld's drinking one too."
37:28;37:29;"Are you drinking on the job?"
37:29;37:30;"Yeah, I'm drinking on the job."
37:30;37:33;"Well, it's just a sip, but I would agree with all that."
37:33;37:38;"This is an Anheuser-Busch product, just for context on this as well."
37:38;37:42;"I'm kind of working on an empty stomach too."
37:42;37:45;"So that is three sips in and that is..."
37:46;37:51;"Chocolate chip Cliff Bar into Cacti."
37:51;37:53;"That's a noxious brew, I gotta tell you."
37:53;37:58;"I would feel physically ill if I drank this whole thing."
37:58;38:01;"That sounds kind of right."
38:01;38:03;"Yeah."
38:03;38:08;"I mean, a Cliff Bar and a Cacti, it sort of sounds right."
38:08;38:10;"Oh, it's getting worse with every sip."
38:10;38:11;"Yeah, it's really..."
38:11;38:13;"It has a metallic taste."
38:13;38:15;"Terrible product, Travis."
38:15;38:16;"Yeah."
38:16;38:20;"Can I say, this might be the worst tasting alcoholic beverage I've ever consumed in my life."
38:20;38:21;"Whoa!"
38:21;38:24;"No exaggeration."
38:24;38:27;"I'm with you."
38:27;38:28;"Yeah."
38:28;38:29;"For real?"
38:29;38:30;"Yeah, it's really bad."
38:30;38:31;"The worst alcoholic..."
38:31;38:36;"Seinfeld, I think it's better than the Yingling Hershey's combo."
38:36;38:38;"No, dude, I don't know."
38:38;38:39;"No, that wasn't that bad."
38:39;38:43;"That went down a lot smoother than this."
38:43;38:47;"Also, and of course, I don't have the show notes in front of me, but wasn't this"
38:47;38:52;"the highest selling Anheuser-Busch product upon release?"
38:52;38:54;"What?"
38:54;38:55;"Matt, can you confirm that?"
38:55;38:58;"Can I just ask, is any of it context?"
38:58;39:00;"I mean, it is early."
39:00;39:01;"Like, you're not used to..."
39:01;39:01;"No."
39:01;39:02;"No, dude."
39:02;39:07;"Late night, you're hanging with your friends, playing some Olivia Rodrigo."
39:07;39:08;"Some Travis Scott."
39:08;39:13;"And/or Olivia Rodrigo."
39:13;39:17;"Or/and/or Olivia Rodrigo, and someone's like, ""Oh, I just brought over a six-pack of this stuff."""
39:17;39:19;"And you're like, ""Ooh, kind of."""
39:19;39:22;"That one didn't go down great, that first sip, but then three sips in, you're like,"
39:22;39:23;"""Oh, I'll have another."""
39:23;39:24;"No, man."
39:24;39:26;"It's no white cloth."
39:26;39:28;"It's a recipe for a hangover, for sure."
39:28;39:33;"In its first week, Cacti outperformed the launch of major hard seltzers and"
39:33;39:38;"secured the highest first week rate of sale for a variety pack in Anheuser-Busch history."
39:38;39:41;"That's a weird metric, that this is the highest first week rate of"
39:41;39:43;"sale for a variety pack."
39:43;39:46;"How many variety packs is Anheuser-Busch doing?"
39:46;39:50;"Is there a bud variety pack where you get one bud, one bud light?"
39:50;39:53;"Okay, so they're cooking the books."
39:53;39:55;"Yeah, that sounds fishy."
39:55;39:58;"It outperformed the launch of major hard seltzers."
39:58;39:59;"All right, which ones?"
39:59;40:04;"Okay, I don't know if Cacti's going to have a long life."
40:04;40:09;"And also, the first week of this is also going to be a lot of Travis Scott heads"
40:09;40:11;"buying them and not drinking them."
40:11;40:14;"Obviously, for a beverage to really have legs, it needs to grow."
40:14;40:16;"It needs to be word of mouth."
40:16;40:17;"People got to enjoy it."
40:17;40:18;"So we'll see."
40:18;40:19;"I haven't tried it yet."
40:19;40:24;"You think people are buying cases of this Travis Scott beverage with the hope of selling"
40:24;40:26;"them in five years as a profit?"
40:26;40:27;"Like watches and whiskey?"
40:27;40:28;"Absolutely."
40:28;40:30;"Luxury lifestyle."
40:30;40:34;"Is part of the deluxe lifestyle is hard seltzer."
40:34;40:39;"Well, yeah, because obviously, as millennials are entering middle age now,"
40:40;40:48;"even some Gen Z is kind of like entering like, I'm not even sure they're hot on their heels."
40:48;40:51;"You know, there's going to be a new definition of deluxe life."
40:51;40:57;"If the old deluxe life was whiskey, guitars, watches, the new one's going to be Travis"
40:57;41:04;"Scott Cacti, Travis Scott Chicken McNugget body pillows will probably be something that"
41:04;41:07;"people will be trading and buying for years to come."
41:07;41:12;"Travis Scott will probably as his audience gets a little older, he'll start rolling"
41:12;41:14;"out a new form of deluxe life, I think."
41:14;41:18;"Maybe already is with a much more consumer friendly price point."
41:18;41:23;"Because, you know, yeah, not everyone can get in on these five figure watches."
41:23;41:23;"Huh?"
41:23;41:26;"These four thousand dollar bottles of whiskey."
41:26;41:30;"I mean, he's outrageous that people listening to this show are just like, who are these"
41:30;41:30;"people?"
41:30;41:33;"Deluxe life."
41:33;41:34;"I got to run, guys."
41:34;41:35;"Thank you for indulging."
41:36;41:39;"All right, thank you for dropping the cacti off."
41:39;41:40;"See you guys."
41:40;41:40;"See you, dude."
41:41;41:42;"Yeah, in my white tee."
41:42;41:45;"Call the pipe Williams for the hype, please."
41:45;41:48;"They gon' wipe you before you wipe me."
41:48;41:52;"Unbox these checks, not my Nike's."
41:52;41:55;"Cacti's not no iced tea."
41:55;41:58;"Got them bamboozled like I'm Spike Lee."
41:58;42:01;"You need more than Google just to find me."
42:01;42:04;"I just call up bae to get a high fee."
42:04;42:06;"Incredible."
42:06;42:08;"General."
42:08;42:10;"I just thought the label just to sign me."
42:11;42:13;"Me and Chase connected like we signed me."
42:13;42:16;"We've been on a run, feel like a crime spree."
42:16;42:18;"Talk to me nicely."
42:18;42:20;"Yeah, I see his face."
42:20;42:21;"Yeah, on his white tee."
42:21;42:24;"So I got to check out Sob Rock."
42:24;42:25;"I'm very curious."
42:25;42:26;"They're on track one."
42:26;42:28;"I like track one."
42:28;42:39;"Oh, yeah, I mean, this is this sounds like what he pitched."
42:39;42:40;"Totally."
42:40;42:41;"It sounds a lot like that."
42:41;42:44;"I was about to say that."
42:44;42:49;"Do you think he heard Mountain Brews third EP Raised in a Place 80s Brews?"
42:49;42:51;"Right."
42:51;42:55;"Well, no, because he was saying there was like quotes in the Pitchfork review that he was sort"
42:55;43:01;"of like he's like, what if like a 60s rock star was making records in the 80s?"
43:01;43:03;"And I was like, wow, that's exactly what."
43:03;43:03;"Yeah."
43:03;43:06;"The Mountain Brews Raised in a Place idea was."
43:06;43:06;"I'm sure we had."
43:06;43:07;"Yeah."
43:07;43:09;"Like he's been working on this record for a long time."
43:09;43:11;"So call it convergent evolution."
43:11;43:13;"But we both had the same idea."
43:13;43:14;"But yeah."
43:14;43:28;"This song is awesome."
43:28;43:30;"Yeah, it's a strong start."
43:30;43:32;"Yeah, good vibe."
43:32;43:36;"So this has some members of Toto, Lenny Castro."
43:36;43:37;"That's what it says."
43:37;43:39;"And also Lenny Castro and Greg Phillinganes."
43:39;43:44;"Greg Phillinganes was like Michael Jackson's keyboardist for a long time"
43:44;43:48;"and actually has a dope solo album from the 80s too."
43:48;43:49;"That's funny."
44:02;44:06;"I remember I was texting with a friend of the show, Stephen Hyden, a while ago."
44:06;44:11;"I was telling him that we were working on another 70s kind of country rock"
44:11;44:13;"Mountain Brews thing."
44:13;44:18;"He was like, I wonder if you could hire Don Felder to play a solo."
44:18;44:20;"Oh, totally."
44:20;44:23;"And I was like, that's a really funny idea."
44:23;44:24;"I was like, that's not really what it's about."
44:24;44:30;"I mean, he'd probably ask for a ridiculous amount of money."
44:30;44:34;"You never know, man, because someone like a Don Felder,"
44:34;44:36;"he might not get as many calls as you think."
44:36;44:38;"Right."
44:38;44:39;"You know?"
44:39;44:40;"He might not be getting any calls."
44:40;44:42;"Well, because think of, I bet there's so many people."
44:42;44:47;"And if you're just like, oh man, Hotel California solo, one of the all-time greats,"
44:47;44:48;"they'll just be like, absolutely."
44:48;44:54;"Joe Walsh, even though Don Felder wrote the original, you know, he's doing right there."
44:54;44:54;"He wrote the chord progression."
44:54;44:55;"Right."
44:55;44:56;"Right."
44:56;45:00;"He's got a less name recognition than Joe Walsh or Don Henley."
45:00;45:01;"For sure."
45:01;45:03;"It's just like, I just thought of that."
45:03;45:04;"Yeah."
45:04;45:08;"Maybe like a future project, get Felder to rip a solo."
45:08;45:09;"That'd be really funny."
45:09;45:11;"Absolutely."
45:11;45:19;"That song was fun."
45:19;45:20;"Okay."
45:20;45:23;"And that's a hundred percent what you guys were describing."
45:23;45:24;"Yeah."
45:24;45:29;"And he says, ""Mayor told Zane Lowe,"" shout out Apple Music,"
45:29;45:34;"""about the influence of Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ensemble."""
45:34;45:34;"Oh, interesting."
45:34;45:39;"He said it was an aesthetic achievement and he described himself as a director"
45:39;45:42;"comparing his vision for an album to that of a feature length film."
45:42;45:44;"So, okay, based on what you're saying."
45:44;45:45;"Okay."
45:45;45:47;"He probably saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, great film."
45:47;45:53;"And was like, ""Quentin Tarantino has this love letter to an era, but tells his own story"
45:53;45:55;"that's not historically accurate."""
45:55;46:01;"But you get to be there in 1969 Hollywood and you get to see these familiar faces,"
46:01;46:04;"but it's still weird and his own thing."
46:04;46:06;"And maybe John Mayer wanted to do that for 1988."
46:06;46:09;"But you guys are saying that-"
46:09;46:10;"He didn't follow through on the record."
46:10;46:14;"I mean, with that aesthetic, I was very excited if he'd really just drilled down."
46:14;46:16;"He didn't get weird."
46:16;46:22;"I think that's the general consensus is he played it safe."
46:22;46:22;"Yeah."
46:22;46:24;"I wasn't expecting him to get weird."
46:24;46:33;"I was expecting a more faithful and meticulous attention to the aesthetic concept of the"
46:33;46:33;"record."
46:33;46:39;"The rest of it's fairly innocuous, coffee shop, acoustic driven stuff."
46:39;46:41;"Maybe we need a Jake remix."
46:41;46:45;"Jake gets in and actually makes sure that everything sounds like 1988."
46:45;46:48;"I mean, I guess if he really wanted to go full Tarantino,"
46:48;46:53;"he would have hired some local LA DJ from the 80s."
46:53;46:58;"Would have had interstitials that just be like, ""You're listening to KCSW,"
46:58;47:02;"home of Sob Rock, bringing you all of the late 80s greatest Sob Rock hits."
47:02;47:06;"Next one coming up, we got something real nice from John Mayer."
47:06;47:07;"All right, drive safe out there."""
47:07;47:09;"You know, or something like..."
47:09;47:10;"That'd be cool."
47:10;47:15;"I don't know, write a song about the 1988 election."
47:15;47:16;"Oh, yeah."
47:16;47:18;"Well, yeah, I mean, lyrics versus Bush."
47:18;47:20;"I mean, we haven't even just..."
47:20;47:22;"Like the lyrics are real disappointing."
47:22;47:24;"Even like last string coming and sort of just like..."
47:24;47:26;"That's so innocuous."
47:26;47:27;"There's no..."
47:27;47:30;"Well, but that's period appropriate."
47:30;47:33;"Yeah, sure."
47:33;47:33;"I guess so."
47:33;47:36;"I had higher expectations, that's all."
47:36;47:39;"I mean, your relationship to John Mayer's had a lot of ups and downs."
47:39;47:42;"After that first time you saw ""Dead & Co."""
47:42;47:42;"Right."
47:42;47:45;"You judged his playing very harshly, but then he won you right back."
47:45;47:47;"So maybe this will be the same thing."
47:47;47:47;"Right, yeah."
47:47;47:51;"Sob Rock 2, 1989 is gonna come out and you're gonna be like, ""This is what I was looking for."""
47:51;47:53;"The attention to detail is immaculate."
47:53;47:54;"Thank you, John."
47:54;47:55;"Thank you, sir."
47:55;47:56;"Thank you, John."
47:56;48:02;"Jake just writing like a four paragraph comment in the iTunes store."
48:02;48:07;"""Thank you, sir."
48:07;48:10;"I was deeply disappointed in Sob Rock 1."""
48:10;48:15;"I respected that he's even just putting those vibes out there."
48:15;48:21;"In terms of being like, ""I wanna make a 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' for 1988 Sob Rock."""
48:21;48:24;"Even if you didn't feel like doing that for every song."
48:24;48:26;"It's like, ""Wow, you got my attention."""
48:26;48:31;"Serious question though, do you think he's listened to Mountain Bruce?"
48:31;48:33;"I don't think it's impossible."
48:33;48:38;"I think it was like a 10% chance that Mayer's heard Mountain Bruce."
48:38;48:40;"Do you think he's listened to Time Crisis?"
48:40;48:44;"I would say a 35% chance he's listened to Time Crisis."
48:44;48:46;"He's definitely a fan of Vampire."
48:46;48:52;"I remember when Harmony Hall came out, he shouted out the attention to detail."
48:52;48:53;"Something like that."
48:53;48:57;"The meticulousness of the recording of Harmony Hall."
48:57;48:58;"I saw him in person once after that."
48:58;49:00;"Me and Ariel were at a party and we chatted a little bit."
49:00;49:03;"He's very nice things to say."
49:03;49:05;"Very, really appreciated it."
49:05;49:07;"I gotta remember back to that conversation."
49:07;49:11;"Did I tell him, ""Man, you gotta check out this new Mountain Bruce EP."
49:11;49:12;"It's gonna come out in a few months."
49:12;49:14;"It's kind of like an eight."""
49:14;49:15;"So you know the first two?"
49:15;49:17;"Well, this is kind of like an 80s version."
49:17;49:17;"I think I said it."
49:17;49:18;"Wait, hold on."
49:18;49:19;"Hold on."
49:19;49:19;"I think I said it."
49:19;49:23;"Oh, damn."
49:23;49:24;"It was you."
49:24;49:25;"Wait, his name was John Mayer too."
49:25;49:27;"Oh, it was you."
49:27;49:31;"One day we'll have Mayer on the show, hopefully."
49:31;49:33;"And we'll have so much to talk about."
49:33;49:34;"He'd be a great guest."
49:34;49:36;"But I do like what he's putting out there."
49:36;49:42;"I was raised in a place that's become a disgrace."
49:42;49:50;"Everything that I once knew, now there is no trace."
49:50;49:59;"The pumpkin patch, the fall harvest, has been paid with a new target."
49:59;50:03;"They call it progress, but for who?"
50:04;50:07;"They tell us all, but it's only a few."
50:07;50:23;"They tore the old buildings down, replaced them all in beige and brown."
50:23;50:27;"What do I see when I drive around?"
50:27;50:33;"It's all the same from town to town."
50:34;50:46;"It's all the same from town to town."
50:46;50:54;"There is a funny genre of album that's similar to the Third Bruise EP, which truly is like,"
50:54;50:55;"what do you call that?"
50:55;51:00;"When people write their own version of history in fiction."
51:00;51:03;"Oh, historical fiction?"
51:03;51:05;"No, but it's like alternative histories."
51:05;51:09;"Like Philip Roth, The Plot Against America."
51:09;51:10;"What do you call that?"
51:10;51:11;"Great book."
51:11;51:13;"I thought you'd call it historical fiction."
51:13;51:15;"Or speculative fiction."
51:15;51:15;"Okay."
51:15;51:17;"Speculative fiction."
51:17;51:20;"There's another, yeah, alternate history."
51:20;51:23;"I've always liked that idea for music."
51:23;51:28;"I mean, I found that as a tool for the way I think about music a lot, where it's kind of just like,"
51:29;51:34;"conceptually, just like, what if there was a band that sounded like that, but they listen to that?"
51:34;51:37;"Of course, I think everybody does that a little bit."
51:37;51:43;"But in terms of truly an album being on that bruise level of being like the Third Bruise EP,"
51:43;51:46;"it takes place in this moment in time."
51:46;51:50;"It's imagining somebody from the 60s, but they're making their 80s record."
51:50;51:53;"Every track points in that direction."
51:53;51:55;"I wonder how many records that are like that."
51:55;51:59;"There's one that I could think of that I always found kind of interesting."
51:59;52:02;"I've barely heard it, but you know that band XTC?"
52:02;52:04;"That like great punk new wave band?"
52:04;52:10;"Because those guys love like 60s music so much, they recorded, it might be an EP,"
52:10;52:15;"it might be a full album, but they basically made up a full band called Dukes of the Stratosphere."
52:15;52:22;"And they made a record that was as if it was like a lost late 60s garage psych record."
52:22;52:24;"I can think of a few examples like that."
52:24;52:27;"Phish made a fake album a few years ago."
52:27;52:32;"They kind of made up this like Scandinavian band, this kind of like synthy thing."
52:32;52:33;"But in terms of like a big..."
52:33;52:36;"Famous, I was going to say famously Chris Gaines."
52:36;52:37;"Oh yeah."
52:37;52:40;"No, that's not really an era, but that was more of like a genre."
52:40;52:42;"And he's inventing a whole persona."
52:42;52:46;"And, but I'm saying what these things have in common is that they're all like kind of"
52:46;52:50;"cinematic in that you're truly imagining like a world."
52:50;52:53;"And it's not just like a mood board."
52:53;52:54;"Like most albums have a mood board where you're like,"
52:54;52:56;"""Yeah, we want a little bit of this vibe."""
52:56;53:00;"You're literally imagining a world in which this album exists."
53:00;53:00;"Yes."
53:00;53:02;"Which maybe is like from an alternate timeline."
53:02;53:06;"I'm sure for John Mayer, for any like big artist,"
53:06;53:10;"it probably feels like you could use that as an organizing principle,"
53:10;53:12;"but maybe it feels like if every song's like that,"
53:12;53:13;"are people going to be too weirded out?"
53:13;53:19;"Is it like too inside baseball or like nerdy to go full like 1988?"
53:19;53:23;"Maybe he knows his audience and he knows that a guy like me is not really part of it."
53:23;53:25;"Although it would delight me."
53:26;53:26;"Right."
53:26;53:30;"But he's not worried about me."
53:30;53:32;"Sabrock too is for the jakes of the world."
53:32;53:35;"No, if he fully, because I've been looking at the notes and it says"
53:35;53:37;"he used TikTok a lot for like rolling it out."
53:37;53:40;"You could imagine like a universe where he was like,"
53:40;53:43;"""I'm only promoting this album using 1988 technology."""
53:43;53:45;"Actually, that would be kind of cool."
53:45;53:49;"Imagine he was just like, ""I'm deleting all of my social media accounts."
53:49;53:50;"Definitely won't see me on TikTok."""
53:50;53:53;"You're welcome to use TikTok if you like the songs,"
53:53;53:59;"but my entire campaign is going to be me just doing like going in person to like"
53:59;54:03;"late night TV and like in person radio."
54:03;54:06;"Like we try to get him on time crisis and he's like,"
54:06;54:07;"""Is it AM or FM?"""
54:07;54:08;"We're just like, ""Internet."""
54:08;54:11;"He's like, ""Nope, that's not Sabrock, man."
54:11;54:13;"It's not 88."""
54:13;54:18;"Internet radio, no can do."
54:19;54:24;"Even like his publicist is like going to like the newspapers and like magazines"
54:24;54:25;"and they're just like, ""Well, you know, of course,"
54:25;54:28;"we'll probably throw it online a few days before the print hits."""
54:28;54:30;"And they're just like, ""Absolutely not."
54:30;54:33;"This is only can exist in print."""
54:33;54:34;"Maybe Sabrock too."
54:34;54:36;"That's the Sabrock too model."
54:36;54:37;"Did you see any of his TikToks?"
54:37;54:40;"Because actually that's what got passed around with my friends."
54:40;54:42;"And this was him promoting the new songs?"
54:42;54:43;"Promoting Sabrock."
54:43;54:45;"They got you psyched on Sabrock?"
54:45;54:47;"They got me psyched on his TikToks."
54:47;54:49;"Jake, I showed you and..."
54:49;54:51;"Yeah, it was straight up funny."
54:51;54:51;"Yeah."
54:51;54:57;"He was like, ""Oh man, the label's telling me I need to promote this album"
54:57;54:59;"but do it in like a catchy, fun way."
54:59;55:00;"So here we go."""
55:00;55:05;"And it's just a photo of his dogs or a video of his dogs jumping into a pool."
55:05;55:07;"That's it."
55:07;55:07;"That's fun."
55:07;55:09;"Yeah, it's great."
55:09;55:10;"All right, you know what?"
55:10;55:14;"Sabrock has clearly made a mark one way or another."
55:14;55:16;"I'm excited to listen to it."
55:16;55:20;"And I'll be thinking quite a bit about how it intersects with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
55:20;55:21;"I'm gonna bounce."
55:21;55:23;"Okay, thanks, Anna."
55:23;55:24;"This was great."
55:24;55:25;"Anna, thanks for coming on the show."
55:25;55:27;"Thanks so much for having us."
55:27;55:27;"Thanks for having me."
55:27;55:31;"Yeah, please come back soon."
55:31;55:35;"Maybe we'll have you on in a few more months just to see how"
55:35;55:39;"Sour by Olivia Rodrigo is holding up."
55:39;55:40;"Great."
55:40;55:41;"In the second half of the year."
55:41;55:42;"All right, have a good one."
55:42;55:43;"We'll see you soon."
55:43;55:44;"Bye, guys."
55:44;55:48;"I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon"
55:48;55:51;"But to sit and watch your life"
55:51;55:56;"I've been meaning to put you back to Minnesota"
55:56;55:58;"And it's been a very long time"
55:58;56:00;"You were everywhere"
56:00;56:05;"A little old-fashioned but that's all right"
56:05;56:11;"And I suppose you're thinking of Betty Sink"
56:11;56:14;"And all you wouldn't get in touch with me"
56:14;56:19;"Though I ain't there and you're losing my head"
56:19;56:23;"I sure do want you to know that you're where it's rare"
56:23;56:28;"There ain't a lady in the land so fine"
56:28;56:29;"Oh my"
56:29;56:33;"Remember their basic importance"
56:33;56:35;"Your brother's karate"
56:35;56:37;"Your all-day rock and roll show"
56:39;56:43;"Home sick blues and radical blues"
56:43;56:45;"Have left a mark on you"
56:45;56:47;"You were everywhere"
56:47;56:51;"A little out of time but I don't mind"
56:51;56:58;"But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine"
56:58;57:02;"But I'll forget without even trying"
57:02;57:04;"Now I'm keeping my heart out"
57:04;57:06;"Trying to get a letter to you"
57:06;57:12;"I like saying thanks for having us to someone who came over"
57:12;57:15;"Like thanks for allowing us into your life"
57:15;57:18;"Thanks for having us but you had me"
57:18;57:19;"Nah man"
57:19;57:21;"You had us"
57:21;57:25;"I like it when people want to end a conversation and they're like I'm gonna let you go"
57:25;57:25;"Oh yeah"
57:25;57:27;"And you're like oh"
57:27;57:31;"I've heard people claim that that's like a midwestern thing"
57:31;57:34;"Because it's that classic it's like that Minnesota nice kind of vibe"
57:34;57:36;"Where everything has to be couched in niceness"
57:36;57:37;"Right"
57:37;57:39;"I say it sometimes as a joke"
57:39;57:42;"I'll say that to like I don't know"
57:42;57:44;"I couldn't say that with a straight face"
57:44;57:46;"I could say that like jokingly to like someone I'm close with"
57:46;57:49;"Well I'll let you go"
57:49;57:50;"All right I'm gonna let you go"
57:50;57:54;"Yeah I've had people say it to me like in a totally straight up way"
57:54;57:56;"And I'm like I thought we were talking here"
57:56;58:00;"My favorite is if you listen to a lot of Howard Stern"
58:00;58:03;"He basically ends every interview"
58:03;58:05;"Like when he wants it to go away right"
58:05;58:07;"And you know these celebrities he goes"
58:07;58:09;"Well we've said it all"
58:09;58:13;"Like literally I'm sure you can get like hundreds of times"
58:13;58:17;"He says some version of we said it all"
58:17;58:19;"And then you're like oh he wants us over"
58:19;58:19;"He wants it over"
58:19;58:21;"Yeah no that's great in regular conversation"
58:21;58:25;"Like I think there is this awkward thing where sometimes"
58:25;58:28;"Both parties know that you've said it all"
58:28;58:29;"At least for the moment"
58:30;58:33;"But people just like don't quite know how to like move on"
58:33;58:36;"Because it seems rude to be like well I'm done"
58:36;58:39;"Because honestly there's oftentimes where both people are done"
58:39;58:40;"But I like that"
58:40;58:42;"Well we've said it all"
58:42;58:44;"All right I had a friend"
58:44;58:45;"Catch you next time"
58:45;58:47;"Just straight up go what else"
58:47;58:50;"Like when the conversation"
58:50;58:53;"A natural resting point"
58:53;58:55;"Maybe like yeah what else"
58:55;58:57;"That's kind of like a comedian thing"
58:57;58:59;"You know like that's like an old school comedian thing"
58:59;59:03;"To be like huge applause and just like what else what else what else"
59:03;59:06;"It'd just be like me and him"
59:06;59:11;"And I'd be like yeah I don't know man what else"
59:11;59:13;"What else what else"
59:13;59:14;"Oh I'll tell you something"
59:14;59:17;"Have you ever been waiting in line at Quiznos"
59:17;59:20;"Get this"
59:20;59:22;"Get this"
59:22;59:23;"What else what else"
59:23;59:24;"Oh here's one"
59:24;59:26;"Oh here's one"
59:26;59:27;"How about that dreaded subway"
59:27;59:28;"You have a new job in San Miro"
59:29;59:34;"Well it's a shame because Seinfeld's a huge fan of the show"
59:34;59:37;"But I referenced it before so we could just talk about it briefly"
59:37;59:40;"Because we're already kind of very late on it"
59:40;59:43;"But I think you should leave season two"
59:43;59:45;"It's out now streaming on Netflix"
59:45;59:46;"Recommend it for anybody"
59:46;59:49;"Truly one of my favorite shows of the last few years"
59:49;59:51;"I thought the first season was flawless"
59:51;59:52;"This one's great too"
59:52;59:56;"And me and Arielle made a small song for it"
59:56;59:58;"Which some people caught"
59:58;01:00:01;"I really didn't know if people would recognize it"
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Because it was just like kind of a funny thing"
01:00:03;01:00:08;"They asked us to do a song for what I think might be my"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"Outside of any of the music or anything like that"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"This definitely is like one of my favorite sketches of this season"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"The sloppy steak sketch"
01:00:15;01:00:18;"Which has this strange flashback"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"Where a group of guys go to a restaurant and have sloppy steaks"
01:00:22;01:00:26;"Which they define as a steak where you pour some water on it"
01:00:26;01:00:30;"And then they go to this restaurant where the waiter says to them"
01:00:30;01:00:31;"This just kills me"
01:00:31;01:00:32;"The waiter goes up to the guys"
01:00:32;01:00:33;"""Hey guys, no sloppy steaks tonight"""
01:00:33;01:00:35;"And they're like ""Oh come on, what are we gonna do?"""
01:00:35;01:00:38;"And then as soon as he leaves they start dumping water on their steaks"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"Anyway, they wanted a song"
01:00:40;01:00:41;"And they wanted it to be"
01:00:41;01:00:44;"They wrote these like kind of crazy lyrics that were like"
01:00:44;01:00:47;"""It's a dangerous night, the night is a knife"""
01:00:47;01:00:49;"""It's the light of my life, I want a dangerous knife"""
01:00:49;01:00:52;"And they were playing me this weird music"
01:00:52;01:00:54;"It sounded like what they wanted was"
01:00:54;01:00:59;"What I would define as post-Bon Iver, post-Frank Ocean pop music"
01:00:59;01:01:02;"Which has nothing to do with those artists in and of themselves"
01:01:02;01:01:06;"But these are like people who like listen to those artists a lot"
01:01:06;01:01:09;"And then made like slightly lame pop music"
01:01:09;01:01:12;"Trying to use some of their vibes"
01:01:12;01:01:13;"That's how I would describe it"
01:01:13;01:01:14;"When we were talking I was like"
01:01:14;01:01:17;"""Oh wait, so you want that like post-Bon Iver, post-Frank Ocean"""
01:01:17;01:01:20;"""Like not quite as good pop music?"""
01:01:20;01:01:21;"And they were like ""Yeah, maybe"""
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Anyway, that's kind of what we were going for"
01:01:23;01:01:26;"So it's, um, that's kind of the vibe of the song"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"But anyway, that's the story with that"
01:01:28;01:01:30;"I think you should leave"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"- Well that's kind of an alternate - Do you have a relationship to them?"
01:01:32;01:01:33;"To Tim?"
01:01:33;01:01:34;"Or did they just sort of"
01:01:34;01:01:35;"You know, I mean that's a"
01:01:35;01:01:39;"For such a small moment in the series"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"To reach out to you"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"To just be like ""Hey, we want this sort of joke song"""
01:01:44;01:01:46;"""That will play sort of in the background"""
01:01:46;01:01:48;"""Does Vampire Weekend want to record it?"""
01:01:48;01:01:51;"I mean, I like a big swing"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"But I sort of had to assume"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"Either you tweeted about it"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"Or some version of how they DM'd you"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"- Like how does that come about? - No, I"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"I have met Tim a few times"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"And actually he was at the Hollywood Bowl show"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"So maybe he saw Richard Pictures"
01:02:05;01:02:06;"Who knows?"
01:02:06;01:02:10;"But, um, the producers are Lonely Island"
01:02:10;01:02:11;"And I met those guys before"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"And Akiva from Lonely Island is like very involved"
01:02:14;01:02:17;"And actually I have this like longer history with it"
01:02:17;01:02:18;"This is so dumb"
01:02:19;01:02:23;"But I got a text or something from Akiva a few years ago"
01:02:23;01:02:29;"Saying ""I'm producing a new sketch comedy show for Tim Robinson"""
01:02:29;01:02:32;"""There's like a sketch that maybe you could be in"""
01:02:32;01:02:34;"""That we need like a musician"""
01:02:34;01:02:36;"""Would you be open to it?"""
01:02:36;01:02:38;"And I remember like thinking about it"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"And I swear, I'm not trying to be funny"
01:02:40;01:02:41;"I thought to myself like"
01:02:41;01:02:45;"I mean, you know, Akiva's really funny and stuff"
01:02:45;01:02:48;"Like a Tim Robbins sketch comedy show seems like weird"
01:02:48;01:02:50;"I mean, I guess he's kind of a comedic actor"
01:02:50;01:02:52;"Like Tapeheads was kind of funny"
01:02:52;01:02:55;"I even wrote back like a text, something about Tapeheads"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"And I think he was just confused"
01:02:57;01:02:58;"And I really was thinking for a long time like"
01:02:58;01:03:00;"That's random"
01:03:00;01:03:01;"Tim Robbins like kind of like"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Must be like in his 60s now"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Starting like a sketch comedy show"
01:03:05;01:03:06;"Like the Lonely Island guys"
01:03:06;01:03:08;"I was like, I mean, maybe"
01:03:08;01:03:10;"And I just kind of, the thought was so weird"
01:03:10;01:03:11;"I just like didn't know what to make of it"
01:03:11;01:03:14;"And I swear to God, for months"
01:03:14;01:03:17;"If it would come up, I, like Akiva hit me up again"
01:03:17;01:03:18;"I was like, oh man, I'm"
01:03:18;01:03:21;"It's not, I wasn't like trying to get out of it or anything"
01:03:21;01:03:23;"But I was just like a tiny bit confused"
01:03:23;01:03:26;"And I was like, like me when Tim Robbins"
01:03:26;01:03:30;"I don't know, it just sounded kind of strange to me"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"And I put it out of my head"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"And I wasn't kidding at all"
01:03:33;01:03:35;"Like I just totally saw the name Tim Robbins"
01:03:35;01:03:36;"And I knew who Tim Robinson was"
01:03:36;01:03:37;"I remember him from SNL"
01:03:37;01:03:39;"I had the show Detroiters"
01:03:39;01:03:40;"Thought he was really funny"
01:03:40;01:03:43;"But just something like the moment I saw the text"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"I just really thought it was Tim Robbins"
01:03:45;01:03:47;"And I'm not, I have nothing against Tim Robbins"
01:03:47;01:03:49;"But I was just like, I think I was just like confused by it"
01:03:49;01:03:53;"And I feel like it was much later that I realized"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"I felt so stupid"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"And then I saw Akiva like way after that"
01:03:56;01:03:57;"And I told him this"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"I was like, dude, I swear to God"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"I thought it was Tim Robbins"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Yeah, I was so confused about it"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"Anyway, that's so"
01:04:05;01:04:09;"I mean, I like the idea that Netflix would greenlight"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"A full-on sketch series"
01:04:12;01:04:16;"Starring a 60-year-old, basically dramatic actor"
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Who's funny, but it's like"
01:04:18;01:04:20;"He did a lot of comedy in the 80s"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"I could see it"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"No, but it's such a weird, it's, I just, I don't know"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"I can see the Funko being like"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Well, Nick Cage, you know Nick Cage has a sketch show"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"Anyway, what do you mean?"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"Well, that sounds amazing"
01:04:31;01:04:32;"No, no, but yeah, no"
01:04:32;01:04:33;"And you're like, just wait"
01:04:33;01:04:36;"He's doing a bit in someone else's sketch show?"
01:04:36;01:04:38;"No, no, no, no, no"
01:04:38;01:04:41;"Nicholas Cage has a sketch comedy show"
01:04:41;01:04:42;"It's produced by Lorne Michaels"
01:04:42;01:04:44;"He's gonna play hundreds of characters"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"He loves, you know, there'll be some"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"I mean, it just is such a weird"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Especially when, you know, people chasing cool and everything"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"I don't think it even got far enough that I was actively thinking about it"
01:04:55;01:04:58;"But maybe some part of like my gut was kind of like"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Tim Robbins sketch show"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"I'll wait to see the first season, I think"
01:05:02;01:05:05;"Let's see how this works"
01:05:05;01:05:06;"It just didn't totally make sense to me"
01:05:06;01:05:09;"But of course, you know, I trust like Akiva"
01:05:09;01:05:10;"I'm sure it'd be great"
01:05:10;01:05:13;"But this is like something you want to see first, I think"
01:05:13;01:05:13;"Tape heads"
01:05:14;01:05:16;"I swear to God, I was like, yeah, tape heads"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"I kind of, that was movie was funny, I think"
01:05:18;01:05:21;"Just like a deep"
01:05:21;01:05:22;"I, and you know, it's one of those things too"
01:05:22;01:05:25;"Where, you know, if randomly somebody was like"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"An actor like Tim Robbins, like"
01:05:27;01:05:31;"If somebody said, oh, do you know that he was on SNL?"
01:05:31;01:05:32;"Like 81 to 83"
01:05:32;01:05:35;"I'd be like, no, okay"
01:05:35;01:05:36;"You know what I mean?"
01:05:36;01:05:38;"Like, sure, sure"
01:05:38;01:05:38;"Why not?"
01:05:38;01:05:42;"Robert Downey Jr. was on SNL for one season"
01:05:42;01:05:43;"I didn't even know that"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"Makes sense though"
01:05:44;01:05:47;"Yeah, so it was one of those things where somebody said, no, no"
01:05:47;01:05:50;"He's been doing, actually his background is sketch comedy"
01:05:50;01:05:52;"And you know, he got in this dramatic, like sure"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"A lot of people come, go from comedy into serious roles"
01:05:54;01:05:57;"Tom Hanks was kind of more of a comedic actor at first"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Tom Hanks sketch comedy show"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"Makes sense"
01:06:01;01:06:02;"People like when he's on SNL"
01:06:02;01:06:06;"I like the idea of Netflix also dropping at the same time"
01:06:06;01:06:08;"A Tim Robbins sketch comedy show"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"Right, just very confusing"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"And they're just like"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Drop it like a week after the Tim Robinson one"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"We got Robinson"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"We got Robbins"
01:06:16;01:06:18;"Netflix, the new home of sketch comedy"
01:06:18;01:06:21;"They really like work that angle and all the press"
01:06:21;01:06:24;"Yeah, so that's my whole relationship to it"
01:06:24;01:06:26;"So anyway, when season two came out"
01:06:26;01:06:28;"And they asked if we could do some song"
01:06:28;01:06:32;"Of course, this time I fully understood what it was"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Who was involved"
01:06:33;01:06:34;"And we said yes"
01:06:34;01:06:37;"And me and Ariel banged it out real quick"
01:06:37;01:06:40;"And I don't think it even says in the show"
01:06:40;01:06:41;"But we had to pick like an artist's name"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"So we called it Sloppy Stake Mafia"
01:06:45;01:06:49;"Yeah, maybe I'll throw the song up sometime"
01:06:49;01:06:50;"It's just not a complete song, you know"
01:06:50;01:06:53;"We just like edited it for the show"
01:06:53;01:06:56;"Anyway, I think you should leave season two"
01:06:56;01:06:57;"Check it out"
01:06:57;01:07:00;"What you have to do now is make an entire"
01:07:00;01:07:03;"Sloppy Stake Mafia record that you don't release"
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Right"
01:07:05;01:07:06;"And then in 20 years, maybe drop it"
01:07:06;01:07:07;"Like the legend"
01:07:07;01:07:08;"Exactly"
01:07:08;01:07:09;"We could do, you know, it'd be tight"
01:07:09;01:07:11;"We do a whole Sloppy Stake Mafia album"
01:07:11;01:07:15;"That's like basically Trump era EDM"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"Like Chainsmokers?"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"Yeah, it's like, it's kind of like a fake"
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Chainsmokers record"
01:07:22;01:07:22;"It's like"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"That would rule"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"Actually, I can't, yeah, we could go full"
01:07:26;01:07:28;"Saab rock on it where it's like the vibe is"
01:07:28;01:07:31;"I could actually like picture this dude"
01:07:31;01:07:32;"It's like somebody"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"I think this is like definitely a real person"
01:07:34;01:07:36;"Somebody who grew up being deeply influenced"
01:07:36;01:07:39;"By Frank Ocean, Bon Iver"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"And Chainsmokers"
01:07:42;01:07:43;"That's definitely like a real person"
01:07:43;01:07:45;"They're like, I want to make music that has like"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"The best elements of all of these artists"
01:07:47;01:07:48;"For sure"
01:07:48;01:07:50;"I could totally see it"
01:07:50;01:07:51;"Yeah, all right, 10 tracks"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"I would love to be involved with that record"
01:07:53;01:07:54;"If at all possible"
01:07:54;01:07:55;"I'll pen some lyrics"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"Something"
01:07:56;01:08:00;"If you do a Trump era EDM record"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Track three featuring Mountain Bruce"
01:08:02;01:08:03;"Hell yeah"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"All right, Sloppy Stake Mafia album"
01:08:05;01:08:06;"We're gonna record it soon"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"We're gonna sit on it for a while"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"Maybe drop that in the 2030s, 2040s"
01:08:11;01:08:13;"That'd be a really cool throwback"
01:08:13;01:08:16;"Making an album deliberately to sit on it"
01:08:16;01:08:21;"Now that's what I call Trump era EDM"
01:08:21;01:08:25;"Yeah, it's like in like 2042"
01:08:25;01:08:26;"It's like, all right"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"So everybody knows that Trump era EDM"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"Is like totally trendy"
01:08:30;01:08:31;"Everybody's like super into it"
01:08:31;01:08:33;"Paris Fashion Week"
01:08:33;01:08:36;"All they were playing was Trump era EDM"
01:08:36;01:08:37;"Well, hold on guys"
01:08:37;01:08:38;"If you thought you've heard all of it"
01:08:38;01:08:41;"There is a record that was recorded"
01:08:41;01:08:45;"Just after that era that nobody's ever heard"
01:08:45;01:08:46;"It's got, you're gonna hear a little bit of"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Frank Ocean, Boney Vera flavor"
01:08:48;01:08:49;"And a lot of chain smokers"
01:08:49;01:08:52;"It'd basically be like the Neil Young record"
01:08:52;01:08:53;"A lost classic"
01:08:53;01:08:54;"Yeah"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"From the early 2020s"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"Please don't live in fear"
01:08:58;01:09:03;"We can't see from here right now"
01:09:03;01:09:08;"Send it up from here"
01:09:08;01:09:14;"And feel your mind"
01:09:14;01:09:24;"You know it never stays the same"
01:09:25;01:09:33;"And they will never tell you you're all to blame"
01:09:33;01:09:43;"And your worship was only a shame"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"You're a mistake"
01:09:45;01:09:47;"All everything you said"
01:09:47;01:09:49;"We are underneath it"
01:09:50;01:09:55;"Oh, I'll be mistaken"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"Let's get into the top five"
01:09:58;01:10:01;"It's time for the top five"
01:10:01;01:10:04;"On iTunes"
01:10:04;01:10:07;"So this week on the top five"
01:10:07;01:10:09;"We're doing 89 versus 2021"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"Why did we choose 89?"
01:10:12;01:10:13;"I don't know actually"
01:10:13;01:10:14;"Hannah chose it"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"Okay, and we had Hannah choose"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"Because we thought she might do the top five with us?"
01:10:19;01:10:19;"Yeah"
01:10:19;01:10:20;"Or just because she was a guest?"
01:10:20;01:10:23;"Yeah, I think we maybe thought she'd do the top five"
01:10:23;01:10:25;"But she had to bounce and"
01:10:25;01:10:26;"Okay, you know what?"
01:10:26;01:10:27;"It actually works out because"
01:10:27;01:10:30;"You might think we should have chose 88"
01:10:30;01:10:34;"Because that's kind of the spirit year for Sabrock"
01:10:34;01:10:35;"But Sabrock 2"
01:10:35;01:10:39;"Which is the one that Jake is going to consult on"
01:10:39;01:10:41;"It's got a little more attention to detail"
01:10:41;01:10:43;"That actually takes place in 1989"
01:10:43;01:10:45;"And it's coming out later this year"
01:10:46;01:10:47;"It's going to come out in December"
01:10:47;01:10:49;"During Deluxe Life December"
01:10:49;01:10:53;"So perfect"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"We're so we're doing the 2021 iTunes chart"
01:10:56;01:10:59;"Versus the 1989 Billboard Hot 100"
01:10:59;01:11:04;"And we're going to start with the number five song in 1989"
01:11:04;01:11:07;"Ooh, starting out with a big song"
01:11:07;01:11:09;"Martika - Toy Soldiers"
01:11:10;01:11:13;"Step by step, hearts are right"
01:11:13;01:11:17;"Left, right, left, the all for one"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Has this been sampled?"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"Yeah, Eminem"
01:11:20;01:11:21;"I don't know if I know this song"
01:11:21;01:11:32;"It wasn't my intention to deceive you"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"This was number one for two weeks"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"And it is the way"
01:11:36;01:11:39;"What can I say?"
01:11:39;01:11:45;"Man, imagine Sabrock 2 track one sounds like this"
01:11:45;01:11:47;"I mean, that would be sick"
01:11:47;01:11:50;"That'd be insane"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"That's what I'm just trying to say about the Sabrock record"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"It's like there's so much potential"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"And it was just he left so much"
01:11:56;01:11:59;"On the cutting room floor or whatever"
01:11:59;01:12:03;"I cannot comment until I spend some serious time with it"
01:12:03;01:12:07;"With your heart today"
01:12:07;01:12:11;"Takes a fall"
01:12:11;01:12:15;"Won't you come back and play with me?"
01:12:15;01:12:19;"Step by step, hearts are right"
01:12:19;01:12:24;"Left, right, left, we all fall down"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"All fall down"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"Toy Soldiers"
01:12:28;01:12:29;"Who's Martika?"
01:12:29;01:12:31;"What? I don't know anything about her"
01:12:31;01:12:33;"I think she's kind of a one hit wonder"
01:12:33;01:12:37;"But she was a child star on the TV show Kids Incorporated"
01:12:37;01:12:41;"Fergie was also on the show"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"Is she British?"
01:12:43;01:12:45;"I don't know, I need a little more info"
01:12:45;01:12:49;"And this song is about a friend who is battling a cocaine addiction"
01:12:49;01:12:51;"No, Martika is American"
01:12:51;01:12:54;"She was born in Whittier, California"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"Yeah, she was like a child actor"
01:12:57;01:13:00;"Yeah, so she was like 20 years old"
01:13:00;01:13:04;"So she was like Olivia Rodrigo of her era"
01:13:04;01:13:08;"How could I be so blind to this addiction?"
01:13:08;01:13:11;"If I was done, the next one was gonna be me"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"It's very slow"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"Like, what would you guess the BPM is on this?"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Like high 60s?"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"Something like that"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"Yeah, Eminem sped it up"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"Also, she only released two albums"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"This one came out in '88 called Martika"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"And then in '91, she released Martika's Kitchen"
01:13:30;01:13:33;"That's a tight album title"
01:13:33;01:13:34;"That's a great title"
01:13:34;01:13:37;"She come back and play with me"
01:13:37;01:13:40;"Step by step, heart to heart"
01:13:40;01:13:45;"Left by left, we all fall down"
01:13:45;01:13:47;"Fall down"
01:13:47;01:13:49;"But the toy soldier"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"Is not me"
01:13:52;01:13:55;"People get torn apart"
01:13:55;01:14:01;"Never win, but the battle wages on"
01:14:01;01:14:07;"I'm the toy soldier"
01:14:07;01:14:07;"Oh, here we go"
01:14:07;01:14:10;"Period guitar playing"
01:14:10;01:14:13;"Does Mayer rip some solos like this?"
01:14:13;01:14:15;"Not like quite like this"
01:14:15;01:14:17;"I mean, he rips some 80s solos"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"But they're not like..."
01:14:18;01:14:22;"That had kind of like a slight metal edge to it"
01:14:22;01:14:23;"He doesn't ever go there"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"I mean, Jake, you tell me"
01:14:25;01:14:28;"I don't have a great sort of vocabulary"
01:14:28;01:14:29;"for talking about the tone stuff"
01:14:29;01:14:32;"But he has a very specific way"
01:14:32;01:14:33;"He has a specific guitar tone"
01:14:33;01:14:35;"He doesn't really deviate from"
01:14:35;01:14:37;"It is... it's a very soft ballad"
01:14:37;01:14:38;"But it is not... he doesn't..."
01:14:38;01:14:41;"He plays a certain kind of guitar"
01:14:41;01:14:45;"He's not like going right into the full, metal-y"
01:14:45;01:14:47;"He's not playing like an Ibanez"
01:14:47;01:14:49;"through like a crappy distortion pedal"
01:14:49;01:14:50;"That wouldn't be his typical thing"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Yeah, most of the Mayer stuff is like bluesy"
01:14:53;01:14:56;"I mean, I like some of the guitar playing for sure"
01:14:56;01:14:59;"But again, sort of how I feel like"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"about some of the Grateful Dead studio records"
01:15:01;01:15:04;"I'm like, ""Jerry, give us more solos"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"on the actual record"""
01:15:06;01:15:08;"And that's how I felt about the Mayer too"
01:15:08;01:15:12;"I was like, ""Dude, like have a solo be longer"""
01:15:12;01:15:15;"I will throw in the Eminem song for a second"
01:15:15;01:15:19;"Yeah, it's faster Eminem version"
01:15:19;01:15:23;"Awkward beat"
01:15:23;01:15:24;"It's really awkward"
01:15:25;01:15:26;"It's really awkward"
01:15:26;01:15:31;"That snare is like"
01:15:32;01:15:33;"God, fuck it"
01:15:34;01:15:50;"I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"I ain't never supposed to show it"
01:15:54;01:15:55;"My crew ain't supposed to know it"
01:15:55;01:15:58;"Even if it means going toe-to-toe with the Benzino"
01:15:58;01:15:59;"It don't matter"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"Unless I absolutely have to"
01:16:03;01:16:04;"I'm supposed to set an example"
01:16:04;01:16:06;"I need to be the leader"
01:16:06;01:16:07;"My crew looks for me to guide 'em"
01:16:07;01:16:09;"This is shit that just popped off"
01:16:09;01:16:10;"I'm supposed to be beside 'em"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"That jive splat tried to squash it"
01:16:12;01:16:13;"It was too late to stop it"
01:16:13;01:16:17;"Oh, this is about Machine Gun Kelly beef"
01:16:17;01:16:18;"No, this is way too early"
01:16:18;01:16:19;"This is old"
01:16:19;01:16:21;"Machine Gun Kelly was like in middle school"
01:16:21;01:16:25;"Who's the person that said his daughter's name on a record that he beefed with?"
01:16:25;01:16:26;"That's a good... I'm not sure"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"I'm honestly, I'm exhausted"
01:16:28;01:16:29;"And I'm so caught in it"
01:16:29;01:16:31;"I almost feel I'm the one who caused it"
01:16:31;01:16:32;"This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"It's not why I got in it"
01:16:34;01:16:35;"That was never my object"
01:16:35;01:16:37;"For someone to get killed"
01:16:37;01:16:39;"Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"It wasn't my intentions"
01:16:41;01:16:41;"My intentions were ruined"
01:16:41;01:16:46;"Oh, I guess maybe he got caught in the crossfire of some 50 Cent Ja Rule beef"
01:16:46;01:16:51;"So, you know, Eminem famously like helped discover 50 Cent"
01:16:51;01:16:53;"So they're kind of allies"
01:16:53;01:16:54;"And there were a bunch of..."
01:16:54;01:16:59;"50 Cent Ja Rule were beefing at the time"
01:16:59;01:17:04;"And Ja Rule made fun of Eminem and his daughter"
01:17:04;01:17:07;"He basically used Eminem's own words against him"
01:17:07;01:17:12;"Where he said Eminem says that his ex-wife is a known derogatory term for women"
01:17:12;01:17:14;"And that his mom's a crackhead"
01:17:14;01:17:17;"So then he said, ""So what's Hailey gonna be when she grows up?"""
01:17:17;01:17:20;"Saying, ""Oh, you tell me that your family lineage is so messed up"
01:17:20;01:17:23;"Grandma's messed up, ex-wife is messed up"
01:17:23;01:17:23;"But what is that?"
01:17:23;01:17:25;"What's your daughter gonna be when she grows up?"""
01:17:25;01:17:27;"That is crossing a line"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"So he did it in a song or like in the press?"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"In a song called ""Loose Change"""
01:17:32;01:17:35;"Oh, why did it get to be a song?"
01:17:35;01:17:39;"No, it's a song called ""Loose Change"" where he was going after 50 and Eminem"
01:17:39;01:17:42;"And also questioning the official narrative of 9/11"
01:17:42;01:17:45;"Okay, throwing a lot in there"
01:17:45;01:17:45;"No, that's an inside joke"
01:17:45;01:17:48;"No, because there's a documentary, right?"
01:17:48;01:17:49;"Called ""Loose Change"""
01:17:49;01:17:50;"Yeah, exactly"
01:17:50;01:17:51;"Maybe he was inspired by it"
01:17:51;01:17:56;"So anyway, I guess this Eminem makes this very dramatic song"
01:17:56;01:18:00;"Where he sampled ""Martika"" to like really talk about"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"I guess it's a crisis of leadership"
01:18:02;01:18:05;"Where Eminem's like, ""I'm personally offended by this"
01:18:05;01:18:06;"I want to go after this dude"
01:18:06;01:18:07;"But Dre's telling me hold back"
01:18:07;01:18:09;"I'm kind of like a leader now"
01:18:09;01:18:12;"Now I'm kind of like this career artist"
01:18:12;01:18:13;"This is in 2004"
01:18:13;01:18:16;"You know, so Eminem's been around for like years at this point"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"How's he supposed to act?"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"He's got a whole crew that looks up to him"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"So I guess he was really..."
01:18:22;01:18:23;"Yeah, he was wrestling with a lot"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Okay, that's the number five song"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"I can say this"
01:18:27;01:18:29;"It's a very 1989 song"
01:18:29;01:18:34;"Just kind of like depressing, weird, late 80s"
01:18:34;01:18:35;"Trebly"
01:18:35;01:18:36;"Trebly"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Like that drink"
01:18:38;01:18:43;"The number five song on iTunes right now in 2021"
01:18:43;01:18:45;"Is the Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber with ""Stay"""
01:18:45;01:18:51;"This is kind of sob rock"
01:18:51;01:18:53;"Yeah, this is tight"
01:18:53;01:18:53;"Intro"
01:18:53;01:19:19;"Interesting to see Charlie Puth among the songwriters"
01:19:19;01:19:21;"Oh yeah"
01:19:22;01:19:23;"I mean, he's just out there"
01:19:23;01:19:25;"Sort of sounds like an Olivier Rodrigo song"
01:19:25;01:19:45;"Is this the same chart that we did last time?"
01:19:45;01:19:47;"The iTunes store?"
01:19:47;01:19:49;"Yeah, it's iTunes"
01:19:49;01:19:49;"Okay, it is"
01:19:50;01:19:51;"Matt just emailed me"
01:19:51;01:19:53;"""Interesting that Jake knows who Charlie Puth is"""
01:19:53;01:20:02;"I feel like early TC days was that Charlie Puth on the hook of that ""See You Again"" song"
01:20:02;01:20:05;"Yeah, I know who Charlie Puth is because of TC"
01:20:05;01:20:07;"He has a hit or two"
01:20:07;01:20:09;"No, we've really watched his whole career blossom"
01:20:09;01:20:11;"Because he started out being..."
01:20:11;01:20:12;"He was just the guy on the hook of..."
01:20:13;01:20:17;"It's been a long day without you my friend"
01:20:17;01:20:21;"And I tell you all about it when I see you again"
01:20:21;01:20:22;"And who's that?"
01:20:22;01:20:23;"You don't remember that Jake?"
01:20:23;01:20:25;"Wait, who raps on that?"
01:20:25;01:20:26;"Now that you're singing it"
01:20:26;01:20:30;"He sings that part?"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"Yeah, he was on the hook, but he was kind of an up-and-comer"
01:20:32;01:20:33;"And then he went on to..."
01:20:33;01:20:34;"That's ""Woods Califa"", right?"
01:20:34;01:20:35;"Oh yeah, it was ""Woods Califa"""
01:20:35;01:20:36;"And then he..."
01:20:36;01:20:37;"""Fast and Furious"""
01:20:37;01:20:39;"Yeah, it was a tribute to Paul Walker"
01:20:39;01:20:42;"And then anyway, after that, Charlie Puth had a very illustrious career"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"Writing hits of his own"
01:20:44;01:20:45;"Because he's writing with other people"
01:20:45;01:20:52;"This is perfect, back to the '89"
01:20:52;01:20:55;"The number four song, ""Richard Marks"", right here waiting"
01:20:55;01:20:57;"Oh hell yeah"
01:21:17;01:21:31;"I mean, this is so Sob Rock"
01:21:31;01:21:34;"Oh, again, I haven't heard the album, but just my concept of Sob Rock"
01:21:39;01:21:42;"Picture this, Sob Rock 2, just like track seven"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"Straight up John Mayer doing this song"
01:21:44;01:21:45;"It would rule"
01:21:45;01:21:46;"Just like a cover"
01:21:46;01:21:47;"Yeah, I would love it"
01:21:47;01:21:49;"With a really long solo"
01:21:49;01:21:52;"That would be so sick, like an eight minute version"
01:21:52;01:21:55;"Okay, we got a consultant on Sob Rock 2"
01:21:55;01:21:57;"1988, Sob Rock 2, colon"
01:21:57;01:21:58;"Eight minute, I'll be there waiting"
01:21:58;01:22:02;"1989, the eight minute right here waiting"
01:22:07;01:22:08;"I can picture Mayer singing this"
01:22:08;01:22:11;"Oh yeah, it'd be perfect for him"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"'89 is off to a slow start"
01:22:18;01:22:22;"But it's that same like late '80s, just depressing"
01:22:22;01:22:23;"Oh my god, dude"
01:22:23;01:22:26;"Is this count as Eileen's car?"
01:22:26;01:22:27;"This is textbook"
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Yeah"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"This is foundational text"
01:22:31;01:22:39;"This also just reminds me of like, sometimes watching like very dark, late '80s European movies"
01:22:39;01:22:47;"Like Kristof Kieslowski movies or, wait, who's the famous, you know, Michael Haneke?"
01:22:47;01:22:48;"Oh, sure"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"Have you ever seen those like '80s movies?"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"They're so dark and just like vibey and weird"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"The first one where the family destroys their house"
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Yes"
01:22:56;01:22:59;"And I feel like there's moments in that where they're like watching TV"
01:22:59;01:23:04;"And there's like a late '80s depressing-ass song like this on, you know"
01:23:04;01:23:05;"Yeah"
01:23:05;01:23:09;"Yeah, this just makes me think of like a family destroying their house in late '80s Germany"
01:23:09;01:23:11;"Or Austria"
01:23:18;01:23:19;"Too dark, too dark, let's move on"
01:23:19;01:23:22;"Yeah, this is a real bummer"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Sob Rock 2 is gonna be so dark"
01:23:26;01:23:30;"Okay, number four song back in 2020, I actually wanted to hear this"
01:23:30;01:23:35;"I heard there was a new song, Lil Nas X's new song with Jack Harlow"
01:23:35;01:23:37;"Jake, do you know who either of those people are?"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"I know who Lil Nas X is, I think"
01:23:40;01:23:44;"Did he do, he had a big hit last year or two years ago?"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"Yes"
01:23:45;01:23:46;"Was it like the country?"
01:23:46;01:23:47;"Yes"
01:23:47;01:23:50;"Country Road or whatever"
01:23:50;01:23:51;"Close"
01:23:51;01:23:52;"Country"
01:23:54;01:23:57;"You're on with the road part"
01:23:57;01:23:58;"Yeah, the word country is not in it"
01:23:58;01:23:59;"Old Town Road"
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Old Town Country Road"
01:24:01;01:24:04;"Old Town Country Road"
01:24:04;01:24:07;"Gonna take my horse to the country road"
01:24:07;01:24:08;"I don't know who Jack Harlow is"
01:24:08;01:24:15;"Jack Harlow is a rapper, he's Caucasian, I believe he's from Kentucky"
01:24:15;01:24:17;"And he's become very successful"
01:24:17;01:24:17;"All right"
01:24:17;01:24:20;"And this is their new song Industry Baby"
01:24:22;01:24:25;"Is Lil Nas X from that same part of the country?"
01:24:25;01:24:26;"I don't know where he's from"
01:24:26;01:24:36;"This looks like it's co-produced by Kanye"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"Oh yeah"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"Produced by Take A Day Trip and Kanye West"
01:24:41;01:24:43;"Take A Day Trip, cool name"
01:24:43;01:24:45;"Yeah, that's a good name"
01:24:45;01:24:47;"He's from Lithia Springs, Georgia"
01:24:47;01:24:48;"Probably has that"
01:24:48;01:24:49;"Oh yeah"
01:24:49;01:24:50;"Old Town Road"
01:24:51;01:24:55;"I told you long ago, on the road"
01:24:55;01:24:56;"I got what they waiting for"
01:24:56;01:25:00;"All round from nothing, dawg"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"Get your soul, just tell 'em, ""Ain't layin' low"""
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Lil Nas X was in the studio"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"And he's trying a lot of songs, nothing was working"
01:25:06;01:25:09;"And then they were playing him some beats"
01:25:09;01:25:12;"And he said, ""Hold on, what's that?"""
01:25:12;01:25:14;"When I first heard it, I was like, ""Wow, that sounds like some"
01:25:14;01:25:18;"Like King, intro kind of Jay-Z royalty kind of beat"""
01:25:18;01:25:20;"That's totally true"
01:25:20;01:25:26;"There is that like 2000s era, like trumpets, like royalty type beat"
01:25:26;01:25:30;"It's like a little Rocky, a little Jay-Z"
01:25:30;01:25:34;"I feel like Drake has a lot of songs in that vein, old songs"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"I think of All Of The Lights"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"Oh yeah"
01:25:38;01:25:39;"Royalty"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"On the road, on the road, on the road"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"And this one is for the champions"
01:25:44;01:25:47;"Ain't lost since I began, yeah"
01:25:47;01:25:51;"Funny how you said it was the end, yeah"
01:25:51;01:25:54;"Then I went and did it again, yeah"
01:25:54;01:25:59;"I told you long ago, on the road"
01:25:59;01:26:00;"I got what they waiting for"
01:26:00;01:26:04;"All round from nothing, dawg"
01:26:04;01:26:07;"Get your soul, just tell 'em, ""Ain't layin' low"""
01:26:07;01:26:11;"You was never really rooting for me anyway"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say"
01:26:14;01:26:17;"You're all wrong, nothing, dawg"
01:26:17;01:26:21;"Get your soul, just tell 'em that the break is over"
01:26:21;01:26:25;"Did you see that photo of the like, of the hovel that Kanye is living in?"
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Oh yeah, the stadium?"
01:26:27;01:26:30;"Yeah, but his like the sleeping quarters"
01:26:30;01:26:33;"I mean, yeah, well, because it's probably just like a locker room"
01:26:33;01:26:36;"Yeah, just like mattress on the ground"
01:26:36;01:26:37;"That looks like a classic backstage area"
01:26:37;01:26:40;"And some, yeah, so they're like, ""All right, we'll get a mattress in here real quick"""
01:26:41;01:26:45;"I mean, I love the concept of just like taking over a stadium until you finish your album"
01:26:45;01:26:49;"Kanye providing interesting narratives deep into his career"
01:26:49;01:26:52;"Classic male sleeping quarters"
01:26:52;01:26:55;"Mattress on the ground"
01:26:55;01:26:57;"Nope, no frills"
01:26:57;01:26:58;"Yeah"
01:26:58;01:27:01;"Oh, and also, you know, he's recently divorced"
01:27:01;01:27:04;"Right, that's just like divorced guy sleeping quarters"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"Got the studio apartment"
01:27:06;01:27:10;"Did you see, he has his dumbbells? I loved it"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"To work out a little bit"
01:27:11;01:27:13;"I'm sure people have already made-"
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Yeah, it's just dumbbells"
01:27:14;01:27:18;"Like not a whole set up, but just like a light dumbbells, you know, which I-"
01:27:18;01:27:19;"Oh, good for him"
01:27:19;01:27:19;"I appreciate"
01:27:19;01:27:24;"It actually looked like the kind that, um, adjustable weights"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"So, I don't know why he's not on it"
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Like power blocks?"
01:27:26;01:27:27;"Maybe he's on 50"
01:27:27;01:27:28;"Yeah, power blocks"
01:27:28;01:27:29;"He could be"
01:27:29;01:27:30;"Well, good for Kanye"
01:27:30;01:27:32;"And one thing's for sure, I mean, I'm a huge fan"
01:27:32;01:27:34;"But, you know, like anybody's got his haters"
01:27:34;01:27:38;"One thing is for sure, he really cares"
01:27:38;01:27:40;"He doesn't really do publicity stunts"
01:27:40;01:27:44;"Like, I believe that he's just like in there trying to finish his album"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"And it's just like, ""I don't want to keep going back to the hotel"
01:27:47;01:27:49;"Let me just stay here, be more efficient"""
01:27:49;01:27:51;"And he's just in there"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"But why does he make it in a stadium?"
01:27:53;01:27:54;"That's what I don't understand"
01:27:54;01:27:55;"Is that where he's recording it?"
01:27:55;01:27:55;"Yeah, I didn't understand"
01:27:55;01:27:59;"He had- at least part of it was that they had a listening party"
01:27:59;01:28:02;"Which is funny because that often happens when something's done"
01:28:02;01:28:05;"But, you know, obviously that's not true for Kanye"
01:28:05;01:28:07;"So, they had a listening party in the stadium"
01:28:07;01:28:10;"Which is already like, you know, a big classic kind of Kanye idea"
01:28:10;01:28:13;"You know, like he's had- he's thrown like parties at the Garden before"
01:28:13;01:28:15;"Like where he just played his record"
01:28:15;01:28:19;"And so, you know, took over a stadium to like invite people just come listen"
01:28:19;01:28:20;"So, I think he was probably there"
01:28:20;01:28:24;"And because they were doing this event there, he was like, ""Well, let's set up a studio here"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"And we can finish it"""
01:28:25;01:28:26;"And then it went long"
01:28:26;01:28:28;"And the next thing you know, he's sleeping on the floor"
01:28:28;01:28:31;"And there's no other events happening at the stadium?"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"I think there have been football games"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"[Laughs]"
01:28:35;01:28:38;"I'd love to know kind of the backstory of just like the-"
01:28:38;01:28:41;"The core people who like work in like logistics at the stadium"
01:28:41;01:28:41;"Right"
01:28:41;01:28:42;"And it's like-"
01:28:42;01:28:46;"Okay, so Kanye on game day, I'm gonna need you to move into the broom closet"
01:28:46;01:28:47;"[Laughs]"
01:28:47;01:28:48;"I mean, there is-"
01:28:48;01:28:53;"We're gonna need you to clear out your power blocks and your mattress on game day"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"I think he went to the game"
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Yeah, there was a famous-"
01:28:55;01:28:56;"So maybe he just hasn't left"
01:28:56;01:28:57;"The Atlanta United"
01:28:57;01:28:59;"It was an Atlanta United game over the weekend"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"And he showed up wearing-"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Oh, that's the soccer team?"
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Yeah, it was the soccer team"
01:29:02;01:29:02;"Oh, okay"
01:29:02;01:29:07;"He showed up and he's walking around in his red outfit that he wore, you know"
01:29:07;01:29:10;"This giant puffy red outfit"
01:29:10;01:29:15;"And wearing his sort of nude ski mask mask"
01:29:15;01:29:16;"Uh, and soccer game"
01:29:16;01:29:18;"And he just watched the soccer game"
01:29:18;01:29:20;"And yeah, it was-"
01:29:20;01:29:22;"I mean, it's a confusing sight"
01:29:22;01:29:24;"That is cool, my only note would have been"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"He just should have worn a bathrobe and slippers"
01:29:25;01:29:27;"That would have been tight"
01:29:27;01:29:29;"Just like his hair's still wet"
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Just kind of pops out of one of the-"
01:29:31;01:29:32;"[Laughs]"
01:29:32;01:29:34;"Just one of like the-"
01:29:34;01:29:35;"The doors and just kind of comes out"
01:29:35;01:29:36;"And just like, ""What's up, guy?"""
01:29:36;01:29:38;"Has like a plate of like scrambled eggs, cup of coffee"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"Watches a little bit of games"
01:29:40;01:29:42;"Yeah, do you think he's like just post-mating everything?"
01:29:42;01:29:45;"Because there's probably no kitchen on site"
01:29:45;01:29:46;"Well, maybe there is"
01:29:46;01:29:47;"Maybe there's a kitchen"
01:29:47;01:29:48;"I mean, there must be for all the food"
01:29:48;01:29:49;"Yeah"
01:29:49;01:29:51;"Yeah, he's probably just eating, um, you know"
01:29:51;01:29:53;"Really sh*t stadium nachos"
01:29:53;01:29:57;"And drinking terrible margaritas"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"That'll be for the-"
01:29:59;01:30:00;"[Laughs]"
01:30:00;01:30:00;"That'll be-"
01:30:00;01:30:02;"Living off concessions"
01:30:02;01:30:06;"Like a late era Mountain Brews record called Stadium Rock"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"And Jake lives in Dodger Stadium"
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Until it's done"
01:30:10;01:30:12;"Incredible"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"Drinking the worst margaritas ever"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"During the baseball season"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"Yeah, during baseball season"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"Artist in residence, man"
01:30:20;01:30:23;"It's really not that weird of a concept"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"People have that everywhere"
01:30:24;01:30:28;"Okay, the number three song back in '89"
01:30:28;01:30:30;"""Love and Rockets"" with ""So Alive"""
01:30:31;01:30:32;"""Love and Rockets"" is-"
01:30:32;01:30:35;"Jake, do you know who ""Love and Rockets"" is?"
01:30:35;01:30:37;"No, that name is familiar"
01:30:37;01:30:39;"I feel like it's some people who were in bands before"
01:30:39;01:30:41;"Right"
01:30:41;01:30:43;"Hold on, I'm gonna look this up"
01:30:43;01:30:53;"They're an English alternative rock band"
01:30:53;01:30:56;"Former Bauhaus members"
01:30:56;01:31:01;"Okay, and they're named after the comic book series"
01:31:01;01:31:03;"""Love and Rocket"" by the Hernandez brothers"
01:31:03;01:31:07;"Which is like a kind of long-running alternative comic"
01:31:07;01:31:25;"I've never heard Bauhaus either"
01:31:25;01:31:26;"Oh, Bauhaus is tight"
01:31:26;01:31:29;"That seems like a real 80s thing of like"
01:31:30;01:31:34;"guys that were in like kind of edgier, artier bands earlier"
01:31:34;01:31:36;"I'm thinking of like the New Order guys"
01:31:36;01:31:38;"and then like kind of like make a new band"
01:31:38;01:31:40;"Yeah, no, there's so much of that"
01:31:40;01:31:43;"They were in like a punk band in the late 70s"
01:31:43;01:31:45;"and they started kind of like a bigger new wave band in the 80s"
01:31:45;01:31:49;"Obviously, Phil Collins from Genesis to Solo Career"
01:31:49;01:31:50;"Obviously, Peter Gabriel"
01:32:00;01:32:01;"Wow, this is like a big hit"
01:32:01;01:32:03;"Yeah, this is boring as hell"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"I mean, I'm into it, but it's like amazing"
01:32:06;01:32:07;"This is a number three hit"
01:32:07;01:32:15;"Is this the chorus right now?"
01:32:15;01:32:16;"I think so"
01:32:16;01:32:23;"I don't get it"
01:32:23;01:32:31;"Whoa"
01:32:31;01:32:38;"That's a very Lost Boys vibe"
01:32:38;01:32:39;"Yeah"
01:32:39;01:32:41;"Which is 87, I guess"
01:32:41;01:32:46;"This definitely be perfect for like a movie soundtrack of this era"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Well, this is very high on the charts"
01:32:48;01:32:50;"I'm shocked"
01:32:50;01:32:52;"Good for ""Love and Rockets"""
01:32:52;01:32:54;"Well done, ""Love and Rockets"""
01:33:20;01:33:25;"It's just like so low stakes, so low energy"
01:33:25;01:33:28;"It's like ""I got everything to do with you"""
01:33:28;01:33:32;"Like that's literally what he's singing"
01:33:32;01:33:34;"And then someone goes ""Ahhhh"""
01:33:34;01:33:43;"I like the drums"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"Drum machine, you think? Or real drums?"
01:33:45;01:33:47;"I don't think there's been a fill yet"
01:33:48;01:33:52;"Yeah, probably drum machine or sampled real drums"
01:33:52;01:33:55;"Yeah, I like that little like conga, ""Kook kook"""
01:33:55;01:34:07;"Yeah, this is like, reminds me of some like late era ""Susie and the Banshees"""
01:34:07;01:34:11;"I feel like a lot of goth musicians ended up in this zone by the late 80s"
01:34:11;01:34:16;"I don't know, I feel like a lot of goth musicians ended up in this zone by the late 80s"
01:34:17;01:34:22;"Like post-Jesus and Mary Chain, kind of like weird 50s"
01:34:22;01:34:29;"Right, I mean, it's so kind of in the middle aesthetically"
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Yeah"
01:34:30;01:34:32;"Do you think it sounded really like minimal at the time?"
01:34:32;01:34:34;"Or like what did it sound like at the time?"
01:34:34;01:34:35;"Was it like..."
01:34:35;01:34:38;"Yeah, I wonder if in '89, like the heads were like"
01:34:38;01:34:41;"""Yo, that 'Love and Rockets' song f***ing crossed over, dude"""
01:34:41;01:34:43;"It's number three on the charts"
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Oh, I'm sure"
01:34:44;01:34:45;"It's crazy"
01:34:45;01:34:48;"But I wonder if it sounded more commercial to like"
01:34:48;01:34:52;"the old Bauhaus heads or like the early ""Love and Rockets"" heads"
01:34:52;01:34:52;"I just..."
01:34:52;01:34:54;"I mean, '89 is like, that makes me..."
01:34:54;01:34:59;"I always think a classic like late 80s song is like ""She Drives Me Crazy"""
01:34:59;01:35:02;"So I could see this going kind of side by side with that"
01:35:02;01:35:02;"Sure"
01:35:02;01:35:03;"I don't know"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"Real mystery"
01:35:05;01:35:11;"The number three song in our era is our good friend Ed Sheeran with ""Bad Habits"""
01:35:11;01:35:12;"I have been hearing this song a lot"
01:35:13;01:35:15;"I was thinking about the TC crew every time it comes on"
01:35:15;01:35:16;"Did we hear it last time?"
01:35:16;01:35:17;"Yeah"
01:35:17;01:35:19;"Yeah, we did"
01:35:19;01:35:30;"Where have you heard this, Ezra?"
01:35:30;01:35:33;"Just like stores, restaurants"
01:35:33;01:35:34;"Like in the grocery store?"
01:35:34;01:35:38;"I feel like I just heard it on the street where like"
01:35:38;01:35:41;"maybe some restaurant had like an outdoor speaker and I heard it"
01:35:41;01:35:43;"Maybe blasting off the radio in a car"
01:35:43;01:35:44;"I love that vibe"
01:35:44;01:35:54;"Oh right, this one"
01:35:54;01:35:58;"It's a heavy song for the grocery store"
01:35:58;01:36:07;"Yeah, you're in the like soda aisle picking up like a 24-pack of Mountain Dew"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"Like ""Bad Habits"" makes you want to move"
01:36:10;01:36:13;"All right, guys, I gotta jump off"
01:36:13;01:36:14;"I'll talk to you both later"
01:36:14;01:36:16;"All right, peace"
01:36:16;01:36:18;"Wow, the whole crew is just kind of slowly"
01:36:18;01:36:19;"Well, I mean, we only have a couple minutes left"
01:36:19;01:36:21;"If this other call goes short, I'm gonna hop back on"
01:36:21;01:36:22;"All right"
01:36:22;01:36:23;"See ya"
01:36:23;01:36:25;"Down to just me and Jake"
01:36:25;01:36:27;"The core, core crew"
01:36:27;01:36:29;"Back to basics here"
01:36:29;01:36:33;"We've lost three other people"
01:36:33;01:36:34;"We lost Hannah, Seinfeld and Nick"
01:36:34;01:36:36;"Hilarious"
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Dwindling throughout the episode"
01:36:39;01:36:41;"I'm in, this is a good song"
01:36:41;01:36:43;"It sounds better to me this week than last week"
01:36:43;01:36:44;"Yeah"
01:36:44;01:37:03;"Good vocal performance"
01:37:03;01:37:08;"I only know how to go too far"
01:37:08;01:37:29;"Would you say this is adjacent to Trump era EDM?"
01:37:29;01:37:30;"A little"
01:37:31;01:37:36;"I mean, this is post-Trump EDM"
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Nothing happens after two"
01:37:38;01:37:40;"It's true, it's true"
01:37:40;01:37:42;"My bad habits lead to you"
01:37:42;01:37:54;"My bad habits lead to you"
01:37:54;01:38:04;"We took the long way around"
01:38:04;01:38:08;"Burned till the fun runs out"
01:38:08;01:38:12;"My bad habits lead to late nights"
01:38:12;01:38:14;"I wonder what Ed thinks of The Chainsmokers"
01:38:14;01:38:18;"I feel like he would like some of their more like songwriting-y songs"
01:38:18;01:38:20;"Yeah, actually, I have no idea"
01:38:20;01:38:22;"I wonder what like Ed Sheeran's like all-time artists are"
01:38:23;01:38:24;"I bet he probably listens to everything"
01:38:24;01:38:27;"Listens to everything"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"You know man, Bob Marley"
01:38:29;01:38:34;"Yeah, just like Bob Marley, The Beatles, Chainsmokers"
01:38:34;01:38:34;"Floyd"
01:38:34;01:38:36;"Probably"
01:38:36;01:38:38;"Probably loves Radiohead"
01:38:38;01:38:41;"I mean, but he did start out as just kind of like a dude with a guitar"
01:38:41;01:38:45;"So I wonder if he has like an acoustic guitar, like just dude, idol"
01:38:45;01:38:47;"Oh, I wonder if he like loves John Mayer"
01:38:47;01:38:49;"Wouldn't shock me"
01:38:49;01:38:50;"I wonder if he's heard Sabra"
01:38:50;01:38:51;"Oh, I'm sure he's heard it"
01:38:52;01:38:57;"I'm speculating on what Ed Sheeran has heard recently"
01:38:57;01:39:02;"Just doing a 20-minute riff imagining Ed Sheeran listening to Sabra"
01:39:02;01:39:05;"Okay, we just got Ed Sheeran's eight favorite songs"
01:39:05;01:39:06;"Thank you, Matt"
01:39:06;01:39:06;"Oh, wow"
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Okay"
01:39:07;01:39:10;"Layla"
01:39:10;01:39:11;"I don't know where this comes from"
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Number one, Layla, Derek and the Dominoes"
01:39:13;01:39:14;"Great song"
01:39:14;01:39:14;"Classic"
01:39:14;01:39:17;"Especially the outro"
01:39:17;01:39:17;"Oh yeah"
01:39:17;01:39:20;"Carrick Fergus, Van Morrison and the Chieftains"
01:39:20;01:39:21;"I don't know"
01:39:21;01:39:21;"That's tight"
01:39:21;01:39:24;"I mean, that's like a traditional song"
01:39:24;01:39:25;"I think that's from this Chieftains album"
01:39:25;01:39:28;"where they like linked up with a lot of like famous singers"
01:39:28;01:39:30;"to do a lot of traditional stuff"
01:39:30;01:39:33;"Stan, Eminem"
01:39:33;01:39:34;"Very cool"
01:39:34;01:39:35;"Classic"
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Volcano, Damian Rice"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Not familiar"
01:39:38;01:39:38;"Don't know it"
01:39:38;01:39:41;"Flooded, Quarry, Nislopi"
01:39:41;01:39:43;"Not familiar"
01:39:43;01:39:43;"Not familiar"
01:39:43;01:39:44;"Cool title"
01:39:44;01:39:47;"They Won't Go When I Go, Stevie Wonder"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"What era Stevie is that?"
01:39:48;01:39:49;"Not sure"
01:39:49;01:39:49;"I don't know that song"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"Indian Sunset, Elton John"
01:39:52;01:39:54;"All right, he's picking some deep sh*t"
01:39:54;01:39:55;"I don't know that one"
01:39:55;01:39:57;"And then Two Shades of Hope, Foy Vance"
01:39:57;01:39:59;"Huh"
01:39:59;01:40:00;"But who's Foy Vance?"
01:40:00;01:40:02;"An Irish musician"
01:40:02;01:40:04;"Okay, interesting"
01:40:04;01:40:08;"I guess this guy is like, yeah, Ed Sheeran's toured with him"
01:40:08;01:40:09;"They have like a close relationship"
01:40:09;01:40:13;"Okay, the next song back to 1989"
01:40:13;01:40:17;"Bobby Brown, On Our Own from Ghostbusters 2"
01:40:19;01:40:21;"Produced by Ellie Reed and Babyface"
01:40:21;01:40:31;"Donald Trump makes an appearance in the video for this song"
01:40:31;01:40:36;"which shows Brown in scenes from the movie projected on buildings and signs around New York City"
01:40:36;01:40:38;"But he wasn't in the movie?"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"No, he's just in the video, I guess"
01:40:40;01:40:45;"Ghostbusters 2, that's the one with the painting"
01:40:45;01:40:46;"Yeah, Viggo the Carpathian"
01:40:46;01:40:49;"Oh yeah, classic film"
01:40:50;01:40:51;"Classic film"
01:40:51;01:41:13;"This sounds sick"
01:41:13;01:41:14;"It sounds great"
01:41:14;01:41:16;"But even this song is like tinged with sadness"
01:41:16;01:41:19;"1989, just a very sad year"
01:41:19;01:41:21;"It's a rough palette, man"
01:41:21;01:41:24;"Yeah, '89 is a tough palette"
01:41:24;01:41:25;"It's melancholic"
01:41:25;01:41:27;"It's not warm, it's not kind"
01:41:27;01:41:27;"Yeah"
01:41:27;01:41:39;"Oh yeah"
01:41:39;01:41:41;"Oh, this is a sick chorus"
01:41:58;01:42:01;"Are these lyrics about Ghostbusters in any way?"
01:42:01;01:42:02;"The first part was"
01:42:02;01:42:05;"""You want something done, you gotta do it yourself"""
01:42:05;01:42:08;"Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones"
01:42:08;01:42:09;"Wait, because..."
01:42:10;01:42:12;"Yeah, because the Ghostbusters always have to just do s*** themselves"
01:42:12;01:42:14;"They get no support from the municipal government"
01:42:14;01:42:18;"That's always the vibe, right?"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"Right, and then in part two, they're disgraced"
01:42:21;01:42:22;"They're out of business"
01:42:22;01:42:28;"Everyone's forgotten that they saved the entire city five years prior"
01:42:28;01:42:31;"Ray Stantz is running a cult bookstore"
01:42:31;01:42:34;"Called Ray's Occult"
01:42:34;01:42:36;"They're on their own"
01:42:36;01:42:39;"And then there's the rivers of slime under the city, right?"
01:42:39;01:42:40;"Right"
01:42:40;01:42:44;"All the psychic turbulence is metastasized into"
01:42:44;01:42:45;"Oh yeah, yeah"
01:42:45;01:42:46;"A river of slime"
01:42:46;01:42:50;"I love in those movies how Ackroyd plays all of the"
01:42:50;01:42:55;"kind of like paranormal knowledge and all of the technology they develop"
01:42:55;01:42:57;"He plays it so straight"
01:43:02;01:43:04;"Oh, this is rapping back to Ghostbusters"
01:43:04;01:43:05;"There we go"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"All the while the slime was under the building"
01:43:15;01:43:18;"Found out about Vigo, the master of evil"
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Try to battle my boys?"
01:43:19;01:43:20;"That's not legal"
01:43:20;01:43:24;"Just a Ghostbusters rap"
01:43:24;01:43:27;"You think he'd seen the movie when he made this song"
01:43:27;01:43:31;"or it was earlier in the pipeline and they had to give him like a screenplay and like"
01:43:31;01:43:31;"They might have"
01:43:31;01:43:34;"They just had to read the screenplay"
01:43:34;01:43:35;"They might have shown them a rough cut"
01:43:35;01:43:37;"Yeah"
01:43:38;01:43:38;"Get up"
01:44:18;01:44:19;"Okay, great vibe"
01:44:19;01:44:21;"Still a little melancholic"
01:44:21;01:44:25;"Okay, number two song on the iTunes chart"
01:44:25;01:44:28;"Our old friend Walker Hayes with Fancy Like"
01:44:28;01:44:30;"I've thought about the song a few times since we heard it"
01:44:30;01:44:32;"This is the one about going to Applebee's?"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Right"
01:44:34;01:44:39;"This is not the one that is 30 minutes door-to-door to the Walmart or the grocery store"
01:44:39;01:44:39;"Different song"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"No, that was um"
01:44:41;01:44:42;"Oh yeah"
01:44:42;01:44:43;"Aaron Lewis"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"Oh yeah, that was Aaron Lewis, you're right"
01:44:45;01:44:49;"And by the way, apparently at an Aaron Lewis show recently he busted out"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"""It's been a while"""
01:44:50;01:44:51;"Like twice"
01:44:51;01:44:55;"He might have heard us talking on the last TC and was like"
01:44:55;01:44:58;"I want to break something off for these guys"
01:44:58;01:44:59;"Hell yeah"
01:44:59;01:45:02;"You know, I thought of when I saw that was uh"
01:45:02;01:45:05;"Vampire doing A-Punk three times in a row"
01:45:05;01:45:06;"That was a classic moment"
01:45:06;01:45:08;"Classic moment"
01:45:08;01:45:09;"2018"
01:45:09;01:45:11;"Although I guess the way that"
01:45:11;01:45:14;"I didn't read the article but just the headline sort of implied that maybe he was drunk"
01:45:14;01:45:18;"And he didn't realize that he was doing it for the second time"
01:45:18;01:45:20;"Oh, he was just like plastered"
01:45:20;01:45:21;"Apparently"
01:45:21;01:45:23;"I could be wrong"
01:45:23;01:45:28;"I just that's the best impression I got just from like my two seconds of scanning it"
01:45:28;01:45:31;"That he was just like, ""Have I played this one already?"""
01:45:31;01:45:31;"Like just hammered"
01:45:53;01:45:54;"Country song of the summer"
01:46:02;01:46:06;"Jake, when's the last time you did like a full meal at Applebee's"
01:46:06;01:46:07;"Or anything comparable"
01:46:07;01:46:09;"TJ Fridays"
01:46:09;01:46:09;"Ruby Tuesday"
01:46:09;01:46:13;"Um, I feel like"
01:46:13;01:46:15;"Does Denny's count?"
01:46:15;01:46:16;"That's different but"
01:46:16;01:46:21;"Yeah, actually I feel like I've been to Denny's way more recently than I've been to Applebee's"
01:46:21;01:46:24;"There's just like way more reason to go have breakfast at Denny's"
01:46:24;01:46:29;"I did like a lunch at Denny's like within the last year or so"
01:46:29;01:46:31;"Like on a drive up to Northern California like on the"
01:46:31;01:46:33;"Like hit a rest stop"
01:46:33;01:46:37;"Um, Applebee's it's probably been a couple years"
01:46:37;01:46:39;"Um, I've definitely done it though"
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Oh yeah, me too"
01:46:40;01:46:44;"Wait, which one has Jack Daniels sauce Applebee's or TJ Fridays?"
01:46:44;01:46:47;"Damn, this one we need Seinfeld or Nick"
01:46:47;01:46:48;"I couldn't tell you that"
01:46:48;01:46:50;"Are you sure it's not a Chili's?"
01:46:50;01:46:52;"No, it's definitely not Chili's"
01:46:52;01:46:54;"I mean Chili's is like more Southwestern"
01:46:54;01:46:57;"Chili's is the same stuff"
01:46:57;01:46:59;"It's just burgers and sandwiches and"
01:46:59;01:47:00;"Really?"
01:47:00;01:47:01;"You know, they got the Bloomin' Onion"
01:47:01;01:47:03;"Yeah, the Bloomin' Onion"
01:47:03;01:47:05;"That's more like some cowboy sh*t"
01:47:05;01:47:06;"Is it?"
01:47:06;01:47:07;"That's cowboy stuff?"
01:47:07;01:47:12;"I thought that was just like kind of like another version of like fried stuff"
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Does Chili's have like tacos?"
01:47:14;01:47:15;"Oh, Chili's has baby back ribs famously"
01:47:15;01:47:18;"They have like a huge ass like one of those huge lemonade menus"
01:47:18;01:47:21;"I'm sure you could get tacos at Chili's"
01:47:21;01:47:23;"I just feel like because they got that big chili pepper on it"
01:47:23;01:47:24;"I kind of assume that it's like"
01:47:24;01:47:27;"Yeah, maybe it's really not that different"
01:47:27;01:47:29;"All these places have the same sh*t"
01:47:29;01:47:34;"Yeah, I think it's pretty burger intensive the way Applebee's is"
01:47:34;01:47:38;"Chili's has tacos and quesadillas and fajitas"
01:47:38;01:47:42;"Do you think you can get a fajita at TGI Fridays?"
01:47:42;01:47:45;"No, but I bet you could get one at Applebee's"
01:47:45;01:47:48;"Yeah, it all kind of bleeds into each other"
01:47:48;01:47:52;"Where were you when you hit an Applebee's? Do you remember?"
01:47:52;01:47:55;"No, I mean I'm thinking of a time a really long time ago"
01:47:55;01:48:01;"I have a very distinct memory of seeing a movie with my sister and my grandma"
01:48:01;01:48:03;"And then I mean this must have been"
01:48:03;01:48:07;"This is probably like 20 plus years ago actually"
01:48:07;01:48:09;"Oh, this is not the last time"
01:48:09;01:48:14;"I know this is just a distinct memory I have of the first time I had Jack Daniel's sauce"
01:48:14;01:48:16;"And it being like a little underwhelming"
01:48:16;01:48:18;"Is that on like a steak?"
01:48:18;01:48:20;"They have it on a lot of products"
01:48:20;01:48:23;"You know what I've hit these places a lot is like"
01:48:23;01:48:26;"Is when I'm out if I'm and I haven't done this in like a little while"
01:48:26;01:48:29;"But if I'm if I'm out photographing all day"
01:48:29;01:48:32;"And it's like in the summer and it's hot"
01:48:32;01:48:35;"And I'm like photographing stores or landscapes"
01:48:35;01:48:38;"It could be kind of like taxing work"
01:48:38;01:48:41;"Then I'll be like okay it's like one in the afternoon"
01:48:41;01:48:43;"I've been doing this for hours I'm hot"
01:48:43;01:48:45;"I'm gonna like go and do like a sit-down lunch"
01:48:45;01:48:47;"In one of these places that I just shot a photograph"
01:48:47;01:48:50;"Like I'll go do like a sit-down lunch and like Applebee's solo"
01:48:50;01:48:53;"And just get like ice cold beer"
01:48:53;01:48:54;"No I won't do a brew"
01:48:54;01:48:58;"Because I'll keep working the rest of the day so"
01:48:58;01:48:58;"Right"
01:48:58;01:49:01;"I don't drink beer during the a work day"
01:49:01;01:49:04;"Even on a really hot day I think on a really hot day"
01:49:04;01:49:06;"I mean you're much more of a beer drinker than me"
01:49:06;01:49:10;"But I'm very into an ice cold beer lunch in the summer"
01:49:10;01:49:11;"Interesting"
01:49:11;01:49:16;"I'm down for it all summer long weekdays weekend"
01:49:16;01:49:19;"Wow I'll always do a hot ice cold beer"
01:49:19;01:49:22;"For me it's like if I'm like working"
01:49:22;01:49:24;"I save the beer for the end of the day"
01:49:24;01:49:28;"So I'll do like Arnold Palmer and like a"
01:49:28;01:49:31;"You know a turkey club or something at an Applebee's"
01:49:31;01:49:34;"In like West Covina or something"
01:49:34;01:49:35;"Love it"
01:49:35;01:49:41;"Okay the number one song this week in 1989"
01:49:41;01:49:42;"Also from a film"
01:49:42;01:49:44;"1989 had a lot of big movies"
01:49:45;01:49:48;"Including Batman the first one"
01:49:48;01:49:50;"The first Tim Burton one"
01:49:50;01:49:53;"And the single from the Batman soundtrack"
01:49:53;01:49:56;"Was the bat dance by Prince"
01:49:56;01:49:59;"89 a weird year"
01:49:59;01:50:02;"Well there were six Prince songs"
01:50:02;01:50:06;"Yeah he like essentially did the soundtrack"
01:50:06;01:50:09;"How insane is this like we've been living"
01:50:09;01:50:14;"With Batman movies pretty consistently for like 32 years"
01:50:14;01:50:16;"That's never gonna end"
01:50:16;01:50:18;"It's gonna be like James Bond"
01:50:18;01:50:21;"Where like you'll be talking with like your grandchildren"
01:50:21;01:50:22;"And they'll be like"
01:50:22;01:50:24;"Grandpa who's your favorite Batman"
01:50:24;01:50:26;"You'll just be like what are you talking about Christian Bale"
01:50:26;01:50:28;"He f***ing nailed it"
01:50:28;01:50:31;"And they'll just be like wait which ones was he in"
01:50:31;01:50:32;"I've never actually seen those ones"
01:50:32;01:50:36;"For me it's a toss-up between Robert Pattinson"
01:50:36;01:50:38;"Justin Bieber"
01:50:38;01:50:42;"And you know Kim and Kanye's son"
01:50:42;01:50:43;"Right"
01:50:43;01:50:45;"And you'll be like you gotta check out the Bale ones"
01:50:45;01:50:48;"Christopher Nolan those ones are excellent"
01:50:48;01:50:51;"And she's like I tried they're so f***ing boring"
01:50:51;01:50:53;"They're so boring I don't understand how you could be"
01:50:53;01:50:54;"They're like way too arty"
01:50:54;01:50:56;"No those suck"
01:50:56;01:51:00;"And isn't Bale like the like fourth Batman at that point"
01:51:00;01:51:04;"Right you'd be like well have you seen the Michael Keaton ones"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"And they'll just be like who's that"
01:51:06;01:51:07;"Who?"
01:51:07;01:51:10;"Like all right you're gonna you're about to sit down"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"And watch the founder with with grandpa"
01:51:12;01:51:16;"I'm gonna get you into Michael Keaton come hell or high water"
01:51:16;01:51:17;"We're watching Jackie Brown"
01:51:17;01:51:20;"I remember I was 12 and 89 when this movie came out"
01:51:20;01:51:22;"And I was very excited for it"
01:51:22;01:51:23;"And I remember like"
01:51:23;01:51:24;"Oh I bet"
01:51:24;01:51:26;"Everyone started wearing Batman t-shirts all of a sudden"
01:51:26;01:51:30;"Just like that simple black shirt with the yellow logo"
01:51:30;01:51:31;"Great shirt"
01:51:31;01:51:33;"I remember being at like this little league game"
01:51:33;01:51:34;"And seeing this kid in the bleachers wearing it"
01:51:34;01:51:38;"I was just like damn I want that shirt so bad"
01:51:38;01:51:39;"I'm you know I'm not like a big"
01:51:39;01:51:41;"Total grail"
01:51:41;01:51:43;"I'm not like a big shirt guy I never have been"
01:51:43;01:51:47;"Yeah and uh I was just like that Batman shirt rules"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"Yeah no that's"
01:51:48;01:51:51;"But if I could have known that there would be Batman"
01:51:51;01:51:53;"I mean I guess when I was 12 if someone said"
01:51:53;01:51:54;"There'll be Batman movies"
01:51:54;01:51:57;"Very consistently for the next 30 years"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"I probably would have been like awesome"
01:51:59;01:52:03;"I probably would have been very stoked"
01:52:03;01:52:06;"But I mean it was sort of novel in 89"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"Yeah"
01:52:08;01:52:11;"Right no this was the first big superhero movie"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"Since Superman in the 70s"
01:52:14;01:52:15;"Right"
01:52:15;01:52:17;"It was not a very different time"
01:52:17;01:52:19;"I mean it by the way what are we listening to"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"It's crazy that this song was number one"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Just like Prince f***ing around"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"This is a terrible song"
01:52:25;01:52:30;"I mean it's just a f***ing like it's crazy"

01:53:34;01:53:39;"You ever dance with the devil in the pale and the blind"
01:53:39;01:53:45;"I always ask that of all my brain"
01:53:45;01:53:47;"Jack Nicholson just kind of sitting at the after party"
01:53:47;01:53:50;"The sunglasses on just bouncing he said all right"
01:53:50;01:53:51;"All right"
01:53:51;01:53:58;"I can definitely hear the influence Prince's immense influence on Ween in this song"
01:53:58;01:54:00;"Oh yeah totally"
01:54:00;01:54:05;"Was just like the like funky guitar and like the drum machine just like"
01:54:05;01:54:10;"How long is this song"
01:54:10;01:54:12;"Hey"
01:54:12;01:54:22;"It's not a huge leap from here to Piraguava"
01:54:22;01:54:24;"Oh not at all"
01:54:24;01:54:25;"It's really not"
01:54:25;01:54:28;"This is one of the weirdest top fives he's ever done I love it"
01:54:28;01:54:29;"89"
01:54:29;01:54:31;"89 was gold"
01:54:31;01:54:32;"Bizarre year"
01:54:33;01:54:33;"So"
01:54:33;01:54:44;"So it's like buying the cassette single of this"
01:54:44;01:54:46;"I mean it's cool"
01:54:46;01:54:49;"Prince is really doing his thing"
01:54:49;01:54:53;"Wait what did he just say there"
01:54:53;01:54:55;"The town needs an enema"
01:54:55;01:54:57;"The town needs an enema"
01:54:57;01:54:58;"It was uh the Joker"
01:54:58;01:55:00;"Says the town needs an enema"
01:55:01;01:55:09;"I'm getting in on this song"
01:55:09;01:55:11;"Yeah I mean it rolls"
01:55:11;01:55:14;"I'm getting way into this"
01:55:14;01:55:18;"Yeah I mean we got to make Batman freaky again"
01:55:18;01:55:23;"I have a feeling the Robert Pattinson one's gonna probably be really dark again"
01:55:23;01:55:25;"We need like a funk man"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"They should just make a movie called Batdance"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"That just lives in the Batdance universe"
01:55:31;01:55:32;"It's very funky"
01:55:32;01:55:34;"Prince is a character in it"
01:55:34;01:55:39;"Wait is there a Robert Pattinson Batman out already or it's coming out?"
01:55:39;01:55:41;"I don't think it's come out yet"
01:55:41;01:55:46;"Is it a standalone Batman film or is it part of like Batman's hanging out with Superman and"
01:55:46;01:55:49;"No it's a standalone I believe"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Standalone"
01:55:50;01:55:54;"I don't know maybe we'll get lucky there could be a Green Lantern cameo I doubt it"
01:55:54;01:55:57;"Well no I would prefer a I'm not gonna watch"
01:55:57;01:55:59;"I don't watch any of the ones where it's like everyone's hanging out"
01:55:59;01:56:02;"A standalone movie with Pattinson I'll probably actually watch it"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"Your thing with Justice League?"
01:56:04;01:56:06;"Yeah I can't watch any of that stuff"
01:56:06;01:56:08;"And you're not into the Avengers either?"
01:56:08;01:56:09;"Oh hell no"
01:56:09;01:56:16;"I love that your like umbrella category for group superhero movies is everyone hanging out"
01:56:16;01:56:17;"Oh yeah"
01:56:17;01:56:20;"You're just not into ensemble films generally"
01:56:20;01:56:21;"Can't stand Robert Altman"
01:56:21;01:56:24;"Can't stand the Avengers"
01:56:24;01:56:26;"I'm not into everybody hanging out I don't like this"
01:56:26;01:56:29;"Too many people"
01:56:29;01:56:32;"No I mean Pattinson's a great actor you know Batman"
01:56:32;01:56:36;"That I'll actually maybe watch I wonder who's directing that"
01:56:36;01:56:38;"Who cares"
01:56:38;01:56:39;"Too bad that Prince song ended"
01:56:39;01:56:43;"Yeah that was definitely that was dope"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"They need to make a bat dance movie"
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Please DC Universe"
01:56:46;01:56:50;"You're failing so much compared to Marvel you need to get freaky"
01:56:50;01:56:52;"Just make a movie called Bat Dance"
01:56:52;01:56:55;"Hire f*** Tim Robinson to write the script"
01:56:55;01:56:58;"I guarantee you it'll make a billion dollars"
01:56:58;01:57:02;"Bat Dance the movie it takes place in 1989"
01:57:02;01:57:05;"Tim Robinson writes the script I don't know what the f*** else"
01:57:05;01:57:08;"But just do it and it'll be big"
01:57:08;01:57:10;"Get like a crazy soundtrack"
01:57:10;01:57:12;"Yeah all funk"
01:57:12;01:57:14;"Yeah all 70s funk"
01:57:14;01:57:17;"Okay and the number one song this week in 2021"
01:57:17;01:57:20;"Jason Aldean and Carrie Underwood If I Didn't Love You"
01:57:20;01:57:28;"This is new"
01:57:28;01:57:30;"This was not on the last top five"
01:57:30;01:57:32;"No I think it's brand new"
01:57:32;01:57:33;"I wouldn't mind being alone"
01:57:33;01:57:36;"I wouldn't keep checking my phone"
01:57:36;01:57:39;"Wouldn't take the long way home"
01:57:39;01:57:41;"Just to drive myself crazy"
01:57:41;01:57:43;"This is pretty chain smokers actually"
01:57:43;01:57:48;"Yeah it's like a 20 year chain smokers"
01:57:48;01:57:52;"You said to me like I'm doing lately"
01:57:52;01:57:55;"You, you wouldn't be on"
01:57:55;01:57:57;"All that I want"
01:57:57;01:58:00;"I think there's already some serious nostalgia for Trump era EDM"
01:58:00;01:58:03;"And I really feel it kind of filtering back into the culture"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"I'd be good by now"
01:58:06;01:58:08;"I'd be better than bad"
01:58:08;01:58:11;"Oh those power chords on the chorus"
01:58:11;01:58:16;"Very like Def Leppard like guitar time"
01:58:16;01:58:17;"Yeah not bad"
01:58:18;01:58:22;"Turn the want you off whenever I want to"
01:58:22;01:58:24;"If I didn't love you"
01:58:24;01:58:29;"If I didn't love you"
01:58:29;01:58:36;"This is kind of like the drop part"
01:58:36;01:58:39;"Wouldn't have to fake a smile"
01:58:39;01:58:41;"Play it off and tell a lie"
01:58:41;01:58:44;"When somebody asks how I've been"
01:58:44;01:58:46;"Trying to find someone new"
01:58:46;01:58:47;"Someone new"
01:58:47;01:58:48;"Should be something that you"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"This is very depressing in its own way"
01:58:50;01:58:51;"In its own 89 sort of way"
01:58:51;01:58:53;"This actually has 89 energy"
01:58:53;01:58:53;"All right you know what"
01:58:53;01:58:54;"For sure"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"Breaking news I don't care"

01:59:01;01:59:04;"Well especially after that wild Prince song"
01:59:04;01:59:07;"Yeah bat dance is the way to end"

01:59:13;01:59:15;"And we're very excited"
01:59:15;01:59:17;"They just greenlit the movie"
01:59:17;01:59:21;"Tim Robinson is acting in it and writing"

01:59:23;01:59:24;"He's playing Batman"
01:59:24;01:59:27;"The Prince estate is totally on board with it"
