00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis, back again. Here we are talking about music, culture, culinary delights."
00:10;00:18;"Today we have no guest, just raw, uncut Crisis crew discussing the news of the day."
00:18;00:28;"Everything from James Gandolfini's love of Dookie to the music of Lisa Lowe. This is Time Crisis"
00:28;00:30;"with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:32;"Let's begin."
00:38;00:43;"♫ You passed me by, all of those great romances ♫"
00:43;00:51;"♫ You were a pal to me, all my rightful chances ♫"
00:51;00:58;"♫ My picture clear, everything seemed so easy ♫"
00:58;01:05;"♫ And so I dealt you the blow, when a bus had to go ♫"
01:05;01:09;"♫ Now it's different, I want you to know ♫"
01:09;01:15;"♫ One of us is crying, one of us is lying ♫"
01:15;01:19;"♫ We were only there ♫"
01:19;01:23;"Time Crisis back again. What's up, Jake?"
01:23;01:27;"Not much, I feel like we should do full disclosure to the audience."
01:27;01:29;"I just saw you about an hour ago."
01:29;01:34;"That's right. Yeah, we gotta fill everybody in, and I gotta apologize to Seinfeld."
01:34;01:38;"What the hell?"
01:38;01:43;"This is like an episode of a prestige drama that starts at the end."
01:43;01:48;"We see the aftermath of an incident, and then it's like, ""What the hell?"""
01:48;01:53;"And then it's like, ""One hour earlier."""
01:53;01:55;"Everything's tense and weird."
01:55;01:59;"I guess it all started with, I saw on Instagram,"
01:59;02:04;"actor Oliver Hudson post about--"
02:04;02:06;"Actually, I think Rashida showed me."
02:06;02:10;"So this guy, Oli Hudson, posted on Instagram"
02:10;02:15;"him holding this yellow tote bag and a four-pack of beer."
02:15;02:20;"And he posted, ""Thank you so much, French's Mustard, for sharing your mustard beer with me."""
02:20;02:22;"And she was like, ""Is this real?"""
02:22;02:26;"And you know, he's a funny guy. He's kind of a joker."
02:26;02:29;"And I was like, ""I guess it could be real."""
02:29;02:36;"And then, of course, there's levels of real in our weird, marketed reality."
02:36;02:40;"Especially because I feel like back in the day,"
02:40;02:43;"that used to be a very straightforward thing where you'd be like--"
02:43;02:48;"If you saw a picture of something that was just two brands mashed up,"
02:48;02:49;"you're like, ""Is this real?"""
02:49;02:52;"Someone would be like, ""No, no, that's from Mad Magazine."""
02:52;02:54;"Whereas today, there's levels of real where it's like--"
02:54;03:01;"For instance, if you heard that Kentucky Fried Chicken and Widespread Panic"
03:01;03:05;"were teaming up to do a line of sweatpants."
03:05;03:12;"I mean, just because Grateful Dead's been out there doing a lot of collabs lately."
03:12;03:15;"So just imagine that I hit you guys up on the thread and I was like,"
03:15;03:21;"""Hey guys, you hear that KFC and the band Widespread Panic are teaming up for a line of sweatpants?"""
03:21;03:23;"The question of, ""Is it real or not?"""
03:23;03:26;"There's levels to it because one version of it would be,"
03:26;03:30;"""No, no, they're really serious about it. KFC has done some merch before."""
03:30;03:33;"Obviously, Widespread Panic sells t-shirts, but they've never had success with sweatpants."
03:33;03:37;"So they really put their heads together and they're really trying to turn this into a business."
03:37;03:41;"KFC and Widespread. You'd be surprised that a lot of spreadnecks--"
03:41;03:45;"A lot of spreadnecks love KFC."
03:45;03:47;"Is that really the name of the fan base? Spreadnecks?"
03:47;03:49;"I think it's part of the fan base."
03:49;03:51;"Because they're like a southern jam band, right?"
03:51;03:56;"Yeah, but I don't know if every fan of Widespread Panic is a spreadneck."
03:56;03:57;"I think it's possible--"
03:57;03:59;"That's a disgusting term. Spreadneck?"
03:59;04:01;"I don't know about that."
04:01;04:04;"You're a redneck who likes Widespread. You're a spreadneck."
04:04;04:10;"Do you think they went that direction because Deadhead and Spreadhead would be too close?"
04:10;04:11;"Yes, Spreadhead."
04:11;04:13;"Leaning into the southern heritage."
04:13;04:15;"Okay, well, first of all, I'm not--"
04:15;04:17;"We're getting way off base here."
04:17;04:20;"But now that we're here, I want to get into it."
04:20;04:26;"Just like do a linguistical crunch on the Widespread fan base."
04:26;04:29;"Because my guess-- I could be wrong here."
04:29;04:34;"But I think spreadnecks are a subcategory of Widespread fans."
04:34;04:36;"I could totally picture this being a real thing."
04:36;04:40;"Because I grew up with some people in New Jersey who were into Widespread."
04:40;04:42;"You know, classic East Coast jam band heads."
04:42;04:44;"I could picture something where like,"
04:44;04:51;"""I live in Connecticut, and I'll always go see Widespread on the New England run."""
04:51;04:57;"""I'll go as far down, maybe even as Philly, to catch a Widespread show."""
04:57;05:01;"But when you get down south, it's mostly spreadnecks."
05:01;05:04;"And I'm more of like a Yankee Spreadhead."
05:04;05:06;"Maybe there's something like that."
05:06;05:10;"The first result is on forum.fish.net."
05:10;05:13;"""Need help dealing with some spreadnecks."""
05:13;05:19;"And it says, ""My Widespread panic-obsessed friends, spreadnecks."""
05:19;05:21;"Then we have a couple--"
05:21;05:23;"We have some more results."
05:23;05:28;"You know, they're obscure blogs, but it's like, ""I'm a proud spreadneck."""
05:28;05:30;"So maybe I'm wrong."
05:30;05:34;"I have to say, just did some recon in my own house."
05:34;05:38;"You know, Amantha, my wife, is very closely affiliated with Widespread."
05:38;05:40;"Because she put out--"
05:40;05:45;"She released and her brother was Widespread Panic's tour manager for years."
05:45;05:47;"But they came out on her--"
05:47;05:48;"Wait, what?"
05:48;05:51;"Whoa, I didn't never know that."
05:51;05:54;"Because we haven't actually gone as jam as we've gotten."
05:54;05:57;"I bet some emails would suggest this too."
05:57;05:59;"We actually haven't gone very deep on Widespread."
05:59;06:01;"But you know, they're from Athens, Georgia."
06:01;06:05;"They came out on Capricorn Records, which was her and her father's label."
06:05;06:07;"So they're very, very close."
06:07;06:11;"And she says, in her experience, it's Spreadhead."
06:11;06:12;"Oh, really? Spreadhead?"
06:12;06:14;"They're Spreadheads."
06:14;06:20;"And wherever you're getting ""spreadneck"" from does feel like a subcategory of a Spreadhead."
06:20;06:21;"Right."
06:21;06:23;"It's crazy that they're from Athens, Georgia."
06:23;06:25;"What year did they start approximately?"
06:25;06:27;"You know, like mid-'80s?"
06:27;06:29;"I'm going to have to go in the kitchen and ask."
06:29;06:30;"Hold on one second."
06:30;06:35;"I'm just thinking, I mean, iconically, REM is from Athens, Georgia."
06:35;06:39;"And I think of Widespread as really in their heyday in the '80s."
06:39;06:40;"No."
06:40;06:41;"I wonder."
06:41;06:43;"Well, I think they probably got really big in the '90s."
06:43;06:51;"Yeah, so they signed Widespread for their record, I guess that would be their record label debut in '91."
06:51;06:53;"Oh, OK. My bad."
06:53;06:57;"And they were the first band on Capricorn in its revival."
06:57;07:01;"So I bet they would have had to have been around from, yeah, probably '88."
07:01;07:02;"Yeah."
07:02;07:03;"They would have had to have been kicking."
07:03;07:05;"In my head, they started in the early '80s."
07:05;07:06;"I don't know why I thought that."
07:06;07:09;"And then that would have been a fascinating crossover."
07:09;07:16;"I think some of the dudes are older, so it wouldn't shock me if they were like other pre-Widespread bands,"
07:16;07:20;"like gigging around Athens at the same time as early REM."
07:20;07:23;"You know, Jake, I'm not trying to put you on blast, but a few years ago,"
07:23;07:27;"I did send you a Widespread song called ""Picking Up the Pieces,"" and I was like, ""This is kind of cool."""
07:27;07:30;"And I don't think you were feeling it."
07:30;07:32;"I remember, yeah, not totally connecting."
07:32;07:33;"I don't think I hated it."
07:33;07:38;"No, no, you didn't hate on it, but can somebody throw in ""Picking Up the Pieces"" by Widespread?"
07:38;07:40;"Widespread also, they do so many covers."
07:40;07:41;"Like, they..."
07:41;07:42;"Right."
07:42;07:44;"Oh, yeah, I think this song's vibe-y."
07:44;07:52;"It's got that '90s Blind Melon hippie vibe, which not a lot of stuff really has."
08:08;08:10;"Loving that mandolin."
08:10;08:11;"Yeah, I mean, this is a vibe."
08:11;08:13;"You've got to admit, this is a vibe."
08:40;08:41;"I'm feeling that."
08:41;08:45;"It's a little Blind Melon, a little Dave."
08:45;08:50;"And honestly, if some of the production choices were a little different and the harmonies were a little different,"
08:50;08:52;"like, thousands of chains, dude."
08:52;08:54;"Oh, yeah, totally."
08:54;08:56;"Like, thousands of chains."
08:56;08:59;"♪ Picking up the pieces ♪"
08:59;09:02;"Yeah, totally."
09:02;09:03;"It's a thin line."
09:03;09:07;"I mean, I'm sure all these bands, they probably liked a lot of the same classic rock."
09:07;09:10;"But like I was saying, Widespread does so many covers."
09:10;09:14;"They cover a lot of dead songs, a lot of classic rock, Van Morrison and stuff."
09:14;09:21;"There's been multiple times when I thought of a cover idea for Vampire Weekend to do."
09:21;09:24;"And I looked up and I was like, ""Has anybody ever covered this before?"""
09:24;09:30;"I swear, there were like three or four times where it's like, very few people aside from Widespread and Panic."
09:30;09:31;"Do you remember what songs?"
09:31;09:36;"Yeah, there was one kind of deep one."
09:36;09:37;"Okay, well, maybe it's not that deep."
09:37;09:40;"Do you know the song Sharon by David Bromberg?"
09:40;09:41;"No."
09:41;09:42;"I guess we got to throw it on."
09:42;09:44;"Sharon by David Bromberg."
09:44;09:51;"This song's somewhat notable because it's basically the entire Grateful Dead is the backing band."
09:51;09:53;"Oh, wow."
09:53;09:55;"I feel like De La Soul sampled this or something."
09:55;09:57;"Doesn't this sound like a De La Soul song?"
09:57;09:58;"Beastie Boys."
09:58;09:59;"Oh, Beastie Boys?"
09:59;10:02;"It's Paul's Boutique."
10:02;10:04;"And it's just like this funny, weird song."
10:04;10:07;"Oh, yeah."
10:07;10:08;"Is this like '70s?"
10:08;10:09;"Yeah."
10:09;10:14;"I was at this carnival just a few years ago."
10:14;10:17;"No big deal, Ferris wheel."
10:17;10:19;"Wow, this is interesting."
10:19;10:20;"Yeah, it's like-"
10:20;10:23;"It's even like, almost like a Jonathan Richman vibe or like a-"
10:23;10:24;"Yeah, yeah. It's weird."
10:24;10:28;"There's almost something a little like punk about his delivery."
10:28;10:29;"Totally."
10:29;10:31;"What year is this?"
10:31;10:34;"Can we get a number crunch?"
10:34;10:49;"I mean, as I'm listening to it, it's hard to picture me being like, ""I said don't cost no money."""
10:49;10:52;"I don't know if I can pull it off."
10:52;10:54;"1972?"
10:54;10:56;"When was the first Modern Lovers album?"
10:56;10:59;"Right around then, right? '72?"
10:59;11:01;"Uh, later."
11:01;11:03;"Oh, okay."
11:03;11:07;"Cool song."
11:07;11:09;"Yeah, it's a cool song."
11:09;11:13;"It would probably- maybe when I'm a little bit older, I can pull it off."
11:13;11:18;"Anyway, KFC, widespread panic, teamed up to do sweatpants."
11:18;11:21;"If I told you that 20 years ago, you might say, ""Is this real?"""
11:21;11:27;"And I'd say like, ""No, it's the local radio station in Athens, Georgia made it up as an April Fool's Day prank."""
11:27;11:29;"It'd be like, ""It's not real."""
11:29;11:32;"Or if it was real, people would be like, ""That's crazy."""
11:32;11:37;"Whereas today, when you hear something that seems like crazy, it's not even real or not real."
11:37;11:40;"The likelihood is like, ""Yes, it's a promotional thing."""
11:40;11:43;"The whole point is that you say, ""Is it real or not real?"""
11:43;11:45;"And the answer is, ""Kind of."""
11:45;11:47;"Yes, it actually exists."
11:47;11:50;"If it got a lot of buzz, they might make it into a big thing."
11:50;11:53;"And if people mostly just laugh at it,"
11:53;11:59;"they might make the funny cross-promotional thing that makes 20 copies and lives on Instagram and that's that."
11:59;12:03;"So I was thinking about this. Is this French's mustard beer real?"
12:03;12:07;"And I look at this picture of Olly Hudson holding it, and I'm like,"
12:07;12:11;"""You know what? Mustard beer does not sound disgusting to me."""
12:11;12:15;"In fact, the more I thought about it, mustard beer sounded kind of good."
12:15;12:20;"And for the first time ever, I saw some funny cross-promotional item,"
12:20;12:22;"and I was like, ""I actually want to try this."""
12:22;12:24;"I hit our producer Matt up and I said,"
12:24;12:28;"""Can we reach out to French's and find out what the deal is with this and get some?"""
12:28;12:32;"And actually, as I'm saying this, I still don't even know what the deal is."
12:32;12:35;"All I know is that they teamed-- wait, actually, is this in our notes?"
12:35;12:36;"Let me look it up."
12:36;12:37;"Okay."
12:37;12:41;"French's mustard teamed up with Colorado's Oscar Blues Brewery"
12:41;12:45;"to create French's mustard beer, celebrating National Mustard Day on August 1st."
12:45;12:47;"That's also Jerry's birthday."
12:47;12:49;"[laughs]"
12:49;12:53;"Why is National Mustard Day-- Jerry Garcia was born on National Mustard Day?"
12:53;12:55;"Interesting."
12:55;12:58;"Or maybe the mustard industry chose Jerry's birthday"
12:58;13:02;"because they somehow thought that there'd be some interesting resonance."
13:02;13:05;"Oscar Blues describes the taste of French's mustard beer"
13:05;13:08;"as a ""semi-tart tropical wheat beer infused with citrus furies"
13:08;13:11;"to complement French's classic yellow mustard."""
13:11;13:13;"Okay. Makes sense with the heffaweizen."
13:13;13:20;"And I guess it actually-- they actually used real French's yellow mustard to make this."
13:20;13:24;"And, okay, the Oscar Blues-French's collaboration is currently sold out online."
13:24;13:28;"However, the brewery released the recipe online so consumers could make the beer at home."
13:28;13:31;"All right, that's tight. I like that."
13:31;13:33;"Letting the people in on the trade secrets."
13:33;13:37;"But anyway, to bring us up to speed, so Oscar Blues sent it over,"
13:37;13:40;"and then I opened the box, and I realized, like, ""Oh, wait."
13:40;13:44;"Because we're doing this show remotely, how's this gonna work?"
13:44;13:46;"I don't want to be, like, just drinking this by myself."""
13:46;13:48;"So I was like, ""Wait, who's actually in town?"""
13:48;13:52;"And Nick is out of town. Jake and Seinfeld are in town."
13:52;13:56;"So I texted Thread being like, ""All right, how do we do this?"""
13:56;14:00;"Jake was over at his studio. Seinfeld was at his home office."
14:00;14:01;"[laughs]"
14:01;14:05;"And so everybody gave me their addresses, and so Jake's closer to me,"
14:05;14:07;"so I rolled over to Jake's, gave him a beer,"
14:07;14:10;"but it took a little longer than I expected, like, kind of,"
14:10;14:12;"somehow during COVID there's still a rush hour."
14:12;14:15;"So by the time I gave Jake some beer, I realized,"
14:15;14:18;"""I'm not gonna be able to make it to Seinfeld and back to my house."
14:18;14:21;"It just wouldn't work."" So, unfortunately--"
14:21;14:23;"It's no problem. It's totally fine, man."
14:23;14:26;"Well, all right. I'm glad to hear it. You sound totally content with that."
14:26;14:30;"But I did decide, Seinfeld, that I'm gonna give you"
14:30;14:33;"the official French's mustard beer glass,"
14:33;14:38;"because I do feel bad that you didn't get an actual beer,"
14:38;14:40;"but you can have the official beer glass,"
14:40;14:43;"and maybe you can drink your Coca-Cola out of it in the future."
14:43;14:46;"Wow. Okay. That's cool."
14:46;14:49;"So everybody's a winner in this scenario, but in the meantime,"
14:49;14:51;"Jake, should we go grab our brews?"
14:51;14:54;"Yeah, I put mine on ice."
14:54;14:59;"So this kind of beer needs to be ice cold for it to be any good."
14:59;15:00;"Oh, like you put it in the freezer?"
15:00;15:04;"Oh, yeah. I put it in the actual ice box."
15:04;15:07;"Oh, damn. I wish I did that. All right. Well, mine's in the fridge."
15:07;15:08;"I'm gonna go get it."
15:08;15:09;"Let's grab 'em."
15:09;15:12;"I want you to move up and down the beach, well"
15:12;15:15;"The fellas drew branches out of every chain"
15:15;15:17;"These are not a part of the scheme, but"
15:17;15:20;"Let them hope and let them dream"
15:20;15:23;"So many dreams in the mind of a man, well"
15:23;15:25;"Come to life through a good woman"
15:25;15:28;"When mama walks in another place, well"
15:28;15:31;"It's in her eyes and it's on her face"
15:31;15:36;"Some like it cool, some like it hot"
15:36;15:39;"Some give it up, some give it up"
15:39;15:42;"Some wanna give everything that they've got"
15:42;15:44;"Mama wants the mustard, yeah"
15:44;15:47;"She needs a little spice"
15:47;15:49;"Mama wants the mustard, yeah"
15:49;15:53;"She'll spread it out on the line"
15:53;15:55;"Mama wants the mustard, yeah"
15:55;15:58;"She'll never, never stop"
15:58;16:03;"Mama wants the mustard, it will take her to town"
16:03;16:05;"Even just looking at the beer can,"
16:05;16:08;"when you look at it, it incorporates the classic"
16:08;16:10;"French's yellow and logo."
16:10;16:12;"And I'm just saying, like, when you look at this,"
16:12;16:14;"like, sometimes there are these collabs"
16:14;16:16;"and the whole point is that they're kooky."
16:16;16:20;"You know, KFC widespread sweatpants, things of that nature."
16:20;16:24;"But when I look at this, I swear that if, like,"
16:24;16:26;"I guess I feel like I would have heard of it if it was French's,"
16:26;16:27;"but I swear if you were just like,"
16:27;16:30;"you know, like, in the Midwest, there's this thing called mustard beer?"
16:30;16:32;"And I'd be like, what? I'd never heard of that."
16:32;16:34;"And you'd be like, oh yeah, at most neighborhood liquor stores in the Midwest,"
16:34;16:36;"you can get mustard beer."
16:36;16:37;"Really?"
16:37;16:40;"Yeah, it's just like, the distribution network doesn't go that far,"
16:40;16:41;"but it's kind of a classic."
16:41;16:43;"Like, once I heard about something in Nebraska"
16:43;16:45;"that's beer and tomato juice."
16:45;16:47;"Is this real?"
16:47;16:48;"You guys ever heard of that?"
16:48;16:50;"Yeah, I've heard of that, sure."
16:50;16:52;"And you know, it's like a Michelada."
16:52;16:53;"It's very similar to a Michelada."
16:53;16:55;"I think this is just straight up like V8,"
16:55;16:57;"like probably not spicy."
16:57;16:59;"But I heard about that and I was like, that's tight."
16:59;17:01;"That's that type of [bleep] you'd want,"
17:01;17:04;"like road tripping through Nebraska, pull over to like a small town bar,"
17:04;17:07;"and then everybody starts drinking like tomato juice and beer,"
17:07;17:08;"and you're like, can I try one?"
17:08;17:09;"That sounds good to me."
17:09;17:12;"So anyway, I feel like similarly, if you told me like,"
17:12;17:17;"oh yeah, mustard beer, Wisconsin, Ohio, a little bit of Illinois,"
17:17;17:19;"like, I'd be like, that's cool."
17:19;17:21;"That sounds like some cool regional [bleep]"
17:21;17:24;"but it's kind of like upstate New York or something."
17:24;17:27;"They're like, yeah, in the Rochester area, there's this thing called mustard beer."
17:27;17:30;"You know, just like they eat white hot dogs up there."
17:30;17:31;"You guys know about that?"
17:31;17:33;"They eat white hot dogs in Rochester."
17:33;17:34;"White?"
17:34;17:36;"Yeah, they call them white hots."
17:36;17:40;"Wow, upstate New York between Buffalo wings and the white hots in Rochester"
17:40;17:43;"is really punched above its weight in terms of--"
17:43;17:44;"Oh yeah."
17:44;17:48;"Kind of bar meat."
17:48;17:51;"No, there's some amazing food up there."
17:51;17:54;"So anyway, as I look at this, there's just this part of me that's like,"
17:54;17:56;"this makes sense."
17:56;17:57;"So let's try this."
17:57;17:58;"Let's crack these."
17:58;18:01;"All right."
18:01;18:03;"Woo!"
18:03;18:04;"It is complex."
18:04;18:05;"It starts out pretty sweet."
18:05;18:08;"It's pretty light, which I like."
18:08;18:11;"You get a tiny bit of the mustard at the end."
18:11;18:13;"Dude, honestly, this is good."
18:13;18:16;"My only disappointment is that I wish it was a little more mustardy,"
18:16;18:18;"but it's not a bad beer."
18:18;18:19;"They're pretty restrained with the mustard."
18:19;18:21;"I couldn't drink more than one of these."
18:21;18:25;"I think that would get weird, just like slamming mustard beers."
18:25;18:26;"You know what?"
18:26;18:29;"Honestly, the more I sip this, I really get the mustard."
18:29;18:31;"This is a very interesting experience."
18:31;18:33;"It's like a mustard aftertaste."
18:33;18:34;"This is a fascinating beer."
18:34;18:36;"Beer and cars."
18:36;18:38;"That's what Time Crisis is all about."
18:38;18:40;"Wait, so Oscar Blues is from Colorado."
18:40;18:42;"Where's French is from?"
18:42;18:43;"I'm guessing Paris?"
18:43;18:44;"Are you kidding?"
18:44;18:49;"I bet it's probably American, but that'd be cool if it was actually French."
18:49;18:52;"French's was founded in Fairport, New York,"
18:52;18:55;"and then moved to Rochester, New York."
18:55;18:56;"Oh, really?"
18:56;18:58;"Named after Robert Timothy French."
18:58;18:59;"Dude."
18:59;19:00;"Whoa."
19:00;19:01;"I swear I didn't know that about Rochester."
19:01;19:05;"I think a future Mountain Brews EP will be called Bar Meat."
19:05;19:07;"[laughs]"
19:07;19:08;"Just--"
19:08;19:11;"That's the most unappealing album name ever."
19:11;19:13;"[laughs]"
19:13;19:14;"Bar Meat."
19:14;19:18;"Speaking of which, Jake, can I tell them we've been working a little bit on"
19:18;19:19;"The Worst Margarita in My Life?"
19:19;19:21;"Yeah. I'm excited about it."
19:21;19:24;"You sent me that little clip of you singing yesterday."
19:24;19:25;"Yeah."
19:25;19:28;"I'm throwing down some harmonies and things."
19:28;19:29;"It's a great song."
19:29;19:32;"Can't wait for people to hear the finished version."
19:32;19:33;"Dude, I'm doubting this beer."
19:33;19:34;"This is good."
19:34;19:35;"It's interesting."
19:35;19:36;"It's a cool beer."
19:36;19:38;"And again, I can't stress this enough."
19:38;19:41;"I had it on ice for the last 45 minutes."
19:41;19:43;"It is frigid."
19:43;19:45;"It's all about ice cold beers."
19:45;19:47;"Yeah. Hot summer day, it's going down smooth."
19:47;19:49;"Actually, Jake, I got a question for you."
19:49;19:54;"As a bigger beer drinker than me, I've been finding Friday nights,"
19:54;19:58;"if I'm at the studio, I like the tradition of Friday night beer."
19:58;20:00;"Just to wind things down."
20:00;20:04;"And similar to you, I have this instinct, nothing beats an ice cold beer."
20:04;20:09;"So sometimes I might buy some beer and then put it in the freezer."
20:09;20:12;"But then I get all stressed out about the timeline."
20:12;20:16;"Because maybe you put it in the freezer, next thing you know, you're messing around."
20:16;20:19;"Jamming out, getting in the zone."
20:19;20:23;"And then it's always in the back of my mind and stresses me out."
20:23;20:27;"If you leave a beer too long in the freezer, does it explode?"
20:27;20:28;"This is a great question."
20:28;20:33;"I've had the same concern because I often will put beer in the freezer."
20:33;20:37;"But I'm usually like-- I've never had a situation where I've completely forgotten about it."
20:37;20:43;"I'm always like-- even like two hours later, I'll be like, ""Oh no! I gotta get those beers out of the freezer!"""
20:43;20:44;"And they're alright."
20:44;20:47;"I've had some close calls, but yeah, I've never had an explosion."
20:47;20:50;"But it seems like they would if they truly froze."
20:50;20:53;"Especially in a glass bottle, that could be real messy."
20:53;20:56;"Yikes. I mean, I would assume that the freezing point is the same."
20:56;21:00;"Because it's 98% water, so..."
21:00;21:03;"According to the internet, yes, they will explode."
21:03;21:07;"Given beer is about 90% water, the water expands when frozen."
21:07;21:10;"Beer will make a mess in your freezer left too long."
21:10;21:11;"That would be so harsh."
21:11;21:15;"Imagine that you put in a bunch of glass bottles of Corona."
21:15;21:16;"12-pack."
21:16;21:17;"A 12-pack."
21:17;21:20;"You've got a bunch of friends over just jamming."
21:20;21:23;"Jamming in the studio, jamming in the practice space."
21:23;21:26;"You put the 12-pack of Corona in the freezer."
21:26;21:29;"Kind of forget about it because you're in the zone."
21:29;21:32;"And then you're like, ""Oh, s***. Those are probably really cold now."""
21:32;21:35;"And everybody's like, ""Oh, man. I could really use a nice cold beer."
21:35;21:37;"I've been sweating through all this jamming."""
21:37;21:39;"And then you open the fridge."
21:39;21:42;"And not only are there no beers for anybody,"
21:42;21:47;"you've got a dangerous mess of sharp glass and ice."
21:47;21:48;"You have shards of glass."
21:48;21:50;"You know what you need, though, dude?"
21:50;21:51;"Nightmare."
21:51;21:52;"Is a studio cooler."
21:52;21:53;"Right."
21:53;21:56;"So when you make the beer run, then you get the bag of ice."
21:56;21:58;"That's like pro level."
21:58;22:02;"I was listening to--maybe because I was throwing down some harmonies"
22:02;22:03;"on ""Worst Margarita in My Life,"""
22:03;22:06;"I was listening back to all the classic Mountain Breeze."
22:06;22:09;"What's the verse on ""Sweet Chili Heat"" about practice,"
22:09;22:11;"going to band practice?"
22:11;22:13;"♪ Got practice on Monday ♪"
22:13;22:16;"♪ A rehearsal we could use ♪"
22:16;22:18;"That line really jumped out to me this time."
22:18;22:20;"I just love, like, ""Got practice on Monday."
22:20;22:23;"Rehearsal we could use."""
22:23;22:25;"Yeah, we're rusty."
22:25;22:28;"Yeah, and then it goes, ♪ Learning cream puff ♪"
22:28;22:31;"♪ Warhead Mexicali blues ♪"
22:31;22:35;"Oh, yeah, then it's like, ♪ I almost always bring a case ♪"
22:35;22:39;"♪ To load up the fridge down in the practice space ♪"
22:39;22:42;"I can't forget the sweet chili or a ball of sleep."
22:42;22:43;"Oh, right."
22:43;22:47;"For Richard Pictures practice, I usually roll in with a 12-pack of brew"
22:47;22:49;"because, like, we got seven people in the band."
22:49;22:50;"That's gone like that."
22:50;22:53;"Usually I'm bringing a 12-er and someone else is bringing a 12-er"
22:53;22:54;"because that's gone."
22:54;22:56;"And so I load up the beer in the practice space,"
22:56;23:00;"but I also keep a bottle of tequila in the practice space fridge"
23:00;23:04;"because after a few brews, it starts to slow you down a little bit."
23:04;23:09;"So then you have a few nips of tequila to kind of, like, bring you back."
23:09;23:12;"No, and I also--I love this image of, like,"
23:12;23:15;"you've been working all day, but you got practice."
23:15;23:18;"And I like the way you set the stage"
23:18;23:21;"because by saying, ""It's rehearsal we could use,"""
23:21;23:22;"it's clear."
23:22;23:25;"This is not just like, ""Oh, yeah, you know, we're just having fun here."""
23:25;23:27;"It's like, ""No, we got a gig coming up."""
23:27;23:29;"Rehearsal is somewhat important."
23:29;23:33;"And then maybe you're tired from the day and nighttime rehearsal"
23:33;23:36;"and you drink a few beers, but if you start getting sluggish,"
23:36;23:40;"that's going to have negative consequences for the gig coming up."
23:40;23:44;"So in this sense, Sweet Chili Heat really is, like, kind of a lifesaver."
23:44;23:46;"It's a medicine."
23:46;23:47;"Yep."
23:47;23:49;"Well, thanks, Oscar Blues, for sending this beer."
23:49;23:51;"This is actually a good beer."
23:51;23:56;"And I'll give this corporate collab two thumbs up."
23:56;23:59;"It just makes sense."
24:00;24:05;"All I want to do is drink beer for breakfast"
24:05;24:10;"All I want to eat is them barbecue chips"
24:10;24:15;"All I want is someone just to try to protect us"
24:15;24:20;"You can try, but you never want to try to defect us"
24:20;24:26;"Twenty-eight, yeah, I'm a slum"
24:26;24:31;"I'm a living for the bum"
24:31;24:36;"You're listening to Time Crisis."
24:36;24:39;"So this is some big news in the rock community."
24:39;24:41;"Made some waves last week."
24:41;24:45;"An Instagram user named Andrew James Butters"
24:45;24:48;"left a comment on Michael Imperioli's page."
24:48;24:52;"And for anybody who doesn't know, Michael Imperioli is a great actor"
24:52;24:57;"who very famously played Christopher Moltisanti on The Sopranos."
24:57;24:59;"Iconic role on an iconic show."
24:59;25:02;"So this guy, Andrew James Butters, said,"
25:02;25:04;"""What kind of music was Jim into?"""
25:04;25:07;"Meaning James Gandolfini, the star of The Sopranos, Tony Soprano,"
25:07;25:10;"incredible actor who, you know, tragically died."
25:10;25:12;"When was that, like, five or six years ago?"
25:12;25:14;"2013."
25:14;25:16;"2013. Real sad."
25:16;25:17;"Yeah, totally sad."
25:17;25:18;"Way too young."
25:18;25:21;"He always was so good in his roles outside The Sopranos, too."
25:21;25:24;"Just such a great actor from everything you read about him."
25:24;25:26;"Just, like, a very kind dude."
25:26;25:29;"So anyway, Andrew James Butters asked, ""What kind of music was Jim into?"""
25:29;25:32;"And Michael Imperioli responded, ""Green Day."""
25:32;25:35;"And then somebody else wrote, ""Yeah, f---ing right."
25:35;25:38;"Jim listening to Dookie would be an honor to watch."""
25:38;25:41;"I'm not sure what kind of tone that dude was going for."
25:41;25:42;"Honor?"
25:42;25:44;"But also, once you say, ""Yeah, f---ing right,"""
25:44;25:47;"it kind of sounds like you're saying, ""I don't believe you."""
25:47;25:49;"Yeah, you're calling BS."
25:49;25:51;"He meant, like, ""Yeah, f---ing right."""
25:51;25:53;"Oh, that's probably what he meant, because then he's like--"
25:53;25:54;"I love this idea."
25:54;25:56;"It'd be an honor to watch him."
25:56;25:59;"Like, couldn't you see this being, like, a weird YouTube video thing"
25:59;26:01;"of, like, people watching people--"
26:01;26:03;"I guess that's a thing, actually."
26:03;26:05;"There was the Phil Collins thing this past week."
26:05;26:09;"But I love the idea of watching people listen to an entire album."
26:09;26:12;"The whole idea, too, of, like, the Phil Collins thing"
26:12;26:15;"is that there's those two dudes, and they have a lot of good videos."
26:15;26:16;"I watched some more of them."
26:16;26:18;"For anybody who doesn't know, these two dudes went viral."
26:18;26:20;"They listened to music they've never heard before,"
26:20;26:22;"which is a big phenomenon on YouTube."
26:22;26:24;"We've actually talked about it on the show before."
26:24;26:28;"These guys, they listen to all sorts of stuff for the first time."
26:28;26:32;"I watched one where they were listening to ""Do It Again"" by Steely Dan."
26:32;26:33;"They were really feeling it."
26:33;26:36;"And they went viral because they were listening to Phil Collins"
26:36;26:39;"in the air tonight, and you can imagine they were pretty excited"
26:39;26:42;"when the famous drum fill came in."
26:42;26:43;"Yeah."
26:43;26:45;"But the thing that all these videos have in common"
26:45;26:48;"is there's always people listening to something they have no context for,"
26:48;26:52;"which is interesting, especially if people are enthusiastic and funny."
26:52;26:54;"They can make these really interesting observations,"
26:54;26:58;"or it can just be joyous to watch somebody enjoying music."
26:58;27:01;"I thought those kids breathed new life into that song."
27:01;27:02;"I loved it."
27:02;27:04;"There's also something cool about when you watch people hear something"
27:04;27:06;"for the first time, you hear something different, too."
27:06;27:07;"Yeah."
27:07;27:10;"I really like Steely Dan, and I like ""Do It Again,"""
27:10;27:12;"but, you know, there's something about the--"
27:12;27:15;"because I know so much about Steely Dan."
27:15;27:18;"I've read Donald Fagan's book."
27:18;27:19;"You know?"
27:19;27:20;"I just know about that."
27:20;27:21;"I feel like I--"
27:21;27:25;"and maybe just because Donald Fagan is a cranky Jewish dude from New Jersey,"
27:25;27:28;"I feel like I know his whole milieu and style."
27:28;27:33;"So when I hear that song, I'm just picturing these intellectual dudes."
27:33;27:34;"I don't know."
27:34;27:36;"I just have this take on who they are and their life."
27:36;27:39;"But then when you kind of just hear people hearing it with no context,"
27:39;27:44;"you realize that that song is just an amazing, dark, trippy, weird,"
27:44;27:47;"kind of, like, Latin psychedelic."
27:47;27:50;"The way those dudes react to, like, the guitar solo on ""Do It Again,"""
27:50;27:53;"you lose all the context for Steely Dan being, like,"
27:53;27:55;"these smart-ass guys who went to Bard,"
27:55;27:58;"and you really just hear the music, and you're just like,"
27:58;28:01;"""Whoa, this is deep, dark, weird music."""
28:01;28:02;"You know what I mean?"
28:02;28:05;"Wouldn't that be, like, such a trippy thing in the future,"
28:05;28:07;"like some sort of weird drug or something,"
28:07;28:13;"where you could, like, take a pill or do some scan of your brain,"
28:13;28:16;"and you could erase your memory of certain music"
28:16;28:18;"and then listen to it for the first time,"
28:18;28:21;"but nothing else in your brain has changed, you know?"
28:21;28:24;"So, like, imagine if I'm hearing Steely Dan for the first time"
28:24;28:28;"as a 43-year-old guy that likes all this other music."
28:28;28:32;"It would be mind-blowing, because I've heard Steely Dan for, like--"
28:32;28:35;"I've heard Steely Dan nonstop for 35 years"
28:35;28:37;"just by virtue of being, like,"
28:37;28:40;"a guy that listens to classic rock radio in his car,"
28:40;28:42;"you know, and makes Home Depot runs."
28:42;28:45;"So it's like-- it would be amazing to hear that [bleep]"
28:45;28:47;"for the first time. - I know what you mean."
28:47;28:49;"For some reason, it cracked me up to picture, like,"
28:49;28:51;"these, like, scientists who are, like, working really hard"
28:51;28:54;"on, you know, like, neurologists, neuroscientists,"
28:54;28:56;"and then they're like, ""We cracked a code,"
28:56;28:59;"but here's the thing. This is so specific, it's useless."""
28:59;29:01;"And I'm like, ""Well, what is it?"""
29:01;29:04;"""We did figure out how to temporarily erase part of a memory"
29:04;29:06;"and then put it back."" - What?"
29:06;29:08;"- ""Well, that has all sorts of consequences for science,"
29:08;29:10;"for psychology, all this [bleep]."""
29:10;29:12;"And it's like, ""No, but here's the thing."
29:12;29:15;"For some reason, it only applies to the music of Steely Dan."""
29:15;29:16;"[laughter]"
29:16;29:18;"You know what it is? This could be a--"
29:18;29:20;"Jake, you should pitch Hannah on this."
29:20;29:22;"This could be a movie that's a combination"
29:22;29:24;"of the weird Beatles movie, where the--"
29:24;29:26;"- Yeah, ""Yesterday."" - The guy wakes up"
29:26;29:28;"and nobody knows the Beatles. It's a combination"
29:28;29:30;"of ""Yesterday"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."""
29:30;29:33;"- Yeah, this would be a very good Spike Jonze film."
29:33;29:37;"- Yeah. Charlie Kaufman's on the script right now."
29:37;29:38;"- Exactly."
29:38;29:41;"- ""Every middle-aged man has the same fantasy."
29:41;29:44;"What if I could hear Steely Dan again for the first time?"""
29:44;29:47;"""From the minds of Charlie Kaufman,"
29:47;29:49;"Spike Jonze, and Jake Longstreet."""
29:49;29:52;"[laughter]"
29:52;29:54;"But anyway, this is all people who are hearing stuff"

38:26;38:30;"giving himself the creeps, having a weird psychological breakdown."
38:30;38:34;"And when I think of songs that define '90s rock radio,"
38:34;38:38;"I think of this, a year earlier, ""Creep"" by Radiohead."
38:38;38:40;"Of course, there were songs about alienation,"
38:40;38:44;"but to have this many songs that are just about being a loser,"
38:44;38:47;"like back then, pretty soon after this, just like--"
38:47;38:50;"- I mean, all of the Nirvana songs. - Yeah."
38:50;38:53;"""Self-Esteem"" by Offspring, just straight up."
38:53;38:55;"I'm just a sucker who's got no self-esteem."
38:55;38:58;"I'm sure you could go back to the '50s and earlier"
38:58;39:02;"popular music about not having self-esteem or feeling like a creep"
39:02;39:04;"or feeling like a loser or not liking yourself."
39:04;39:06;"I can't get no satisfaction."
39:06;39:08;"Although even that, though, it's tough."
39:08;39:10;"It's almost like you're disappointed with the world"
39:10;39:12;"that they can't give you satisfaction."
39:12;39:15;"I bet somebody could write an essay about this,"
39:15;39:19;"that maybe by the '90s, psychological terms"
39:19;39:23;"had become just so part of how people talked about themselves."
39:23;39:26;"'Cause obviously, everybody has feelings."
39:26;39:28;"Psychologists didn't invent feelings."
39:28;39:30;"All they do is analyze them."
39:30;39:33;"But there's something about the language of these songs--"
39:33;39:38;"""neurotic,"" ""I'm a loser,"" ""I've got no self-esteem,"" ""I'm a creep."""
39:38;39:40;"It's a very specific '90s thing,"

39:47;39:50;"and their own minds in a way that didn't quite exist."

40:16;40:18;"Yeah, but it is funny, too."
40:18;40:20;"I mean, this is almost too deep."
40:20;40:22;"We gotta do more research."
40:22;40:25;"One thing all these songs have in common, to me,"
40:25;40:29;"is that if you look at ""Satisfaction,"" for instance, in the '60s,"
40:29;40:31;"Mick Jagger's almost just like,"

40:42;40:44;"They're like, ""We gotta change s---. This sucks."""
40:44;40:48;"And when I think about my generation"
40:48;40:52;"beyond the kind of millennial, sad boy universe,"
40:52;40:56;"it also expresses a type of disappointment in the world."
40:56;40:58;"But when I think of all these '90s songs,"
40:58;41:00;"they're not disappointed in the world."
41:00;41:02;"They're really just disappointed in themselves."
41:02;41:04;"It's a very interesting moment."
41:04;41:08;"There's very little anger towards the world in these songs."
41:08;41:11;"It really is just like, ""I guess I just f---ing suck."""
41:11;41:14;"I can't think of another moment where there was that vibe"
41:14;41:16;"of just not like, ""The world's messed up,"""

42:11;42:13;"""Oh, yeah? What are you into, man?"""
42:13;42:16;"""Well, my favorite record of all time is 'Dookie' by Green Day."""
42:16;42:19;"You can picture the Dookies into Hooster Dew and Fugazi"
42:19;42:23;"just being kind of like, ""Uh, yeah."""
42:23;42:24;"That's pop."
42:24;42:26;"Yeah, that's pop."
42:26;42:29;"I wonder what kind of conversations they had about it."
42:29;42:31;"Imperioli is a huge GBV head."
42:31;42:32;"Oh, wow."
42:32;42:34;"I mean, you tell me, Jake."
42:34;42:37;"You're a fan of both the record Dookie and GBV,"
42:37;42:40;"but I feel like in the '90s,"
42:40;42:43;"somebody who was really into GBV in, say, like, 1995"
42:43;42:46;"would probably not be singing the praises of Dookie, right?"
42:46;42:49;"Probably not like a guy Imperioli's age at the time,"
42:49;42:51;"like a guy in his 20s, you know?"
42:51;42:54;"I could see a teenager being like, ""Oh, yeah, it's all good."""
42:54;42:57;"Yeah, and if he's like a cool downtown New York actor."
42:57;42:58;"Right."
42:58;42:59;"Like an off-Broadway s--t."
42:59;43:01;"I was sort of like, ""Oh, yeah, I love Weezer."
43:01;43:03;"I love Green Day. I love GBV. I love Pavement."""
43:03;43:05;"You know, I love it all."
43:05;43:07;"You always thought Dookie was a beautiful record."
43:07;43:09;"Always thought it was a beautiful record."
43:09;43:12;"I had a CD, only Green Day record I owned,"
43:12;43:14;"but played the s--t out of that record."
43:14;43:16;"Were you into Blink-182?"
43:16;43:19;"No, see, this is these micro-generations."
43:19;43:21;"I mean, I do like some of their songs,"
43:21;43:23;"but I'd never bought--"
43:23;43:25;"'cause that was, like, later '90s,"
43:25;43:27;"but so at that point, I had lost my youthful,"
43:27;43:29;"open-armed idealism."
43:29;43:32;"In '94, '95, I would have been down with all of it,"
43:32;43:35;"but by '98 or whatever, when Blink dropped,"
43:35;43:38;"I was already too jaded and cool, so I couldn't play."
43:38;43:41;"Talking about the micro-generations of music,"
43:41;43:43;"and then, naturally, because we're talking about TV,"
43:43;43:45;"makes me think of TV, too."
43:45;43:47;"It just made me picture, like, a scenario"
43:47;43:49;"where in another few years,"
43:49;43:52;"it comes out that Jon Hamm"
43:52;43:54;"would listen to ""Enema of the State"""
43:54;43:56;"by Blink-182 on vinyl."
43:56;43:58;"And he's like, ""What?"""
43:58;44:00;"And he's like, ""Well, you know, the thing is, like,"
44:00;44:02;"I was so inspired by, you know,"
44:02;44:04;"James Gandolfini and his performance"
44:04;44:06;"as Tony Soprano,"
44:06;44:08;"and I know he took a lot of inspiration"
44:08;44:10;"from Green Day's album ""Dookie,"""
44:10;44:12;"but, you know, for me and Mad Men,"
44:12;44:15;"our peak was, you know, a solid five to seven years later."
44:15;44:17;"I was more of a Blink-182 guy."
44:17;44:19;"You know, this was my generation."
44:19;44:21;"That's what I listened to on vinyl."
44:21;44:23;"- January Jones was like--you know, I was more"
44:23;44:25;"in the kind of, like, you know, broken social scene"
44:25;44:27;"and stuff like that, but Jon was really"
44:27;44:29;"into Blink-182, and, um..."
44:29;44:31;"What are the other people on that show?"
44:31;44:33;"- Vincent Kartheiser."
44:33;44:35;"Jon Hamm. Kartheiser, come here."
44:35;44:39;"You gotta listen to ""Enem of the State"" on vinyl."
44:39;44:41;"Jon, I'm not into that kind of stuff."
44:41;44:44;"No, sit down, kid. You gotta listen to it on vinyl."
44:44;44:46;"It's gonna blow your mind. Have a seat, son."
44:46;44:48;"- You know, it's interesting, so I just looked it up."
44:48;44:51;"Gandolfini was born in 1961,"
44:51;44:54;"so he would have been 33"
44:54;44:56;"when ""Dookie"" dropped,"
44:56;44:58;"which is... [laughs]"
44:58;45:00;"very cool that, like,"
45:00;45:02;"a 33-year-old man was just like,"
45:02;45:04;"""I'm open to this new"
45:04;45:06;"pop punk that's out and"
45:06;45:08;"playing on MTV all the time."""
45:08;45:10;"And it made me think--I wonder if he, like--"
45:10;45:12;"if James has a real history with, like,"
45:12;45:14;"power pop or punk or, like--"
45:14;45:16;"- Yeah, yeah, no, that's a great point."
45:16;45:18;"And in some ways, finding out that James Gandolfini"
45:18;45:20;"was a huge fan of ""Dookie,"""
45:20;45:22;"I mean, obviously, it's amazing"
45:22;45:24;"to get this look behind the curtain,"
45:24;45:26;"but it does kind of raise more questions"
45:26;45:28;"than it answers. If you just want to know"
45:28;45:30;"what kind of music was James Gandolfini into,"
45:30;45:32;"which is what the original question was,"
45:32;45:34;"somebody tells you, specifically"
45:34;45:36;"the album ""Dookie"" by Green Day."
45:36;45:38;"I have even more questions."
45:38;45:40;"I'm even more tantalized, and that's a great point."
45:40;45:42;"Was it because"
45:42;45:44;"he--yeah, let's picture--so he's 17--"
45:44;45:46;"he's 16 in 1977."
45:46;45:48;"He grew up in Jersey, right?"
45:48;45:50;"- Let me pull up that Wikipedia again."
45:50;45:52;"Oh, yeah, he was born in Jersey."
45:52;45:54;"Early life and education."
45:54;45:56;"Yeah, it seems like he grew up"
45:56;45:58;"in Park Ridge, New Jersey."
45:58;46:00;"Graduated Park Ridge High School in '79."
46:00;46:02;"- Whoa, Park Ridge."
46:02;46:04;"- And he went to Rutgers."
46:04;46:06;"- That's crazy. We grew up in adjacent counties."
46:06;46:08;"I grew up in Glen Ridge, he grew up in Park Ridge."
46:08;46:10;"That North Jersey vibe."
46:10;46:12;"Okay, so Bergen County,"
46:12;46:14;"that's, like, just across the river."
46:14;46:16;"You could picture him being 17, 18."
46:16;46:18;"It's very possible, depending on what he was into,"
46:18;46:20;"that somebody might have been like,"
46:20;46:22;"""Yo, I got my dad's car. You want to drive him to the city?"""
46:22;46:24;"""Well, what are we gonna do?"" And, like, they could have gone"
46:24;46:26;"to, like, CBGB's or something. - Totally."
46:26;46:28;"- It's definitely not impossible."
46:28;46:30;"- I wonder if he was into punk,"
46:30;46:32;"and maybe in the '80s he got into some, like,"
46:32;46:34;"the kind of New Jersey post-punk bands."
46:34;46:36;"Like the Bongos."
46:36;46:38;"The Hoboken scene."
46:38;46:40;"He was at a very early Yola Tango show."
46:40;46:42;"- Oh, yeah, dude. Maxwell's?"
46:42;46:44;"- He saw The Replacements at Maxwell's"
46:44;46:46;"in 1986."
46:46;46:48;"- In '86."
46:48;46:50;"Classic YouTube deep dive."
46:50;46:52;"Replacements at Maxwell's in '86."
46:52;46:54;"I've watched it."
46:54;46:56;"- Yeah, there's a CD of it."
46:56;46:58;"- I can totally see James Gandolfini"
46:58;47:00;"being a type of Jersey guy"
47:00;47:02;"who would go see The Replacements"
47:02;47:04;"at Maxwell's in 1986."
47:04;47:06;"And, yeah, I guess I could"
47:06;47:08;"picture that dude. Then he's 33."
47:08;47:10;"He's not gonna be super"
47:10;47:12;"tuned into all the biases of being,"
47:12;47:14;"like, a 20-year-old punk."
47:14;47:16;"Being like, ""Green Day's not real punk. He doesn't"
47:16;47:18;"give a f***. Can you hear us?"" It's like, ""Man, these guys could write good"
47:18;47:20;"tunes. This is cool."" - Yeah."
47:20;47:22;"- Or was he not a punk? Maybe he wasn't a punk rocker."
47:22;47:24;"And that album came out, and he was like,"
47:24;47:26;"""I like this. This is good music. I never liked"
47:26;47:28;"that punk stuff, but this is pretty good."""
47:28;47:30;"I can see that as well."
47:30;47:32;"- That's totally possible. '80s, he's rolling to, like,"
47:32;47:34;"Rick Springfield and"
47:34;47:36;"Bruce, the bard of Jersey."
47:36;47:38;"- Yeah. - Remember, I think we did a riff"
47:38;47:40;"on this show once about, like,"
47:40;47:42;"Tony Soprano and Pauly."
47:42;47:44;"- Oh, yeah. - Like, a Sopranos prequel"
47:44;47:46;"where Tony and Pauly go"
47:46;47:48;"to a Springsteen show in '84."
47:48;47:50;"- And it was specifically-- this is when I got really"
47:50;47:52;"into the Bruce Springsteen and"
47:52;47:54;"the E Street Band live box set."
47:54;47:56;"- Yeah. - Which came out, I think,"
47:56;47:58;"in the mid-'80s, and"
47:58;48:00;"one of the great songs on it"
48:00;48:02;"is him playing the Tom Waits song"
48:02;48:04;"""Jersey Girl."" - That's right."
48:04;48:06;"- I guess at Giant Stadium. And"
48:06;48:08;"I love that recording because you hear"
48:08;48:10;"all these Jersey people. They don't know this Tom Waits song."
48:10;48:12;"And then as soon as"
48:12;48:14;"Bruce just starts singing the lyrics, the whole stadium"
48:14;48:16;"of people go wild and goes, ""Tonight I'm"
48:16;48:18;"gonna take that ride."
48:18;48:20;"Cross the river to the Jersey side."""
48:20;48:22;"It's like, ""Woo-hoo!"""
48:22;48:24;"Just, like, true regional"
48:24;48:26;"excitement about getting a shout-out."
48:26;48:28;"- ""Tony, what's this song?"""
48:28;48:30;"- ""Yeah, Tony, this--"""
48:30;48:32;"We've done this exact riff before."
48:32;48:34;"""Yeah, Tony, what is this song?"
48:34;48:36;"It's not on none of the Bruce albums."""
48:36;48:38;"""Hey, shut the f--- up. This is a Tom Waits"
48:38;48:40;"cover."" ""Hey, Tony, who"
48:40;48:42;"the f--- is Tom Waits?"""
48:42;48:44;"[laughs]"
48:44;48:46;"- Well, Jake, do you like any"
48:46;48:48;"post-Dookie Green Day? Like, how"
48:48;48:50;"cognizant of it are you?"
48:50;48:52;"- I mean, I know the hits."
48:52;48:54;"I remember, like, the record after that, they had a song called"
48:54;48:56;"""Walking Contradiction."" Good"
48:56;48:58;"song. I don't like the"
48:58;49:00;"acoustic ballad. ""I hope you"
49:00;49:02;"had the time of your"
49:02;49:04;"life."" I don't-- you know."
49:04;49:06;"- Seinfeld-- we must have covered this before, but"
49:06;49:08;"before the final episode of Seinfeld,"
49:08;49:10;"they aired a clip package,"
49:10;49:12;"a clip show. - Yes, yeah."
49:12;49:14;"- And that song was really big at the time, so they"
49:14;49:16;"used ""Time of Your Life,"""
49:16;49:18;"which seemed weirdly sentimental for"
49:18;49:20;"the Seinfeld universe,"
49:20;49:22;"to have just, like, clips of, like, Jerry and"
49:22;49:24;"Elaine and Kramer doing goofy s---, and they're just like,"
49:24;49:26;"""I hope you had the time"
49:26;49:28;"of your-- another turning"
49:28;49:30;"point, a fork stuck"
49:30;49:32;"in the road."" - Yeah, that seems"
49:32;49:34;"like a network call, like NBC"
49:34;49:36;"really trying to sentimentalize the moment."
49:36;49:38;"I don't think Jerry would have been down."
49:38;49:40;"- I-- it's scary. - That probably isn't Jerry's idea."
49:40;49:42;"- I mean, I got a-- I remember hearing that"
49:42;49:44;"song when I was, like, 14, and"
49:44;49:46;"it is a well-written song. It's moving."
49:46;49:48;"And it was brave of Green Day"
49:48;49:50;"to release an acoustic ballad"
49:50;49:52;"as a single. - Incredibly brave."
49:52;49:54;"- So I give it up for that song."
49:54;49:56;"I mean, I wasn't paying attention that much by the"
49:56;49:58;"time of ""American Idiot,"""
49:58;50:00;"but that record is huge. - What are the"
50:00;50:02;"singles off that? I don't know. I-- - ""Don't wanna be"
50:02;50:04;"an American idiot, da-na-na-na-na-na-na."""
50:04;50:06;"- Oh. - And then ""Wake Me Up."""
50:06;50:08;"- There was also, uh, yeah, the 9/11--"
50:08;50:10;"- ""Wake Me Up"" when-- oh, is that what"
50:10;50:12;"it's about? - Yeah, I think"
50:12;50:14;"""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" is a 9/11"
50:14;50:16;"tribute song, right? - Throw"
50:16;50:18;"on ""Wake Me Up When September Ends."""

53:30;53:32;"Red Hot Chili Peppers. The biggest"
53:32;53:34;"bands who, like, are"
53:34;53:36;"still around today, whose first album came out"
53:36;53:38;"in the early 90s, I'm thinking"
53:38;53:40;"Radiohead, Pearl Jam,"
53:40;53:42;"Green Day. I guess if you"
53:42;53:44;"told somebody in, like,"
53:44;53:46;"1994 that Green Day"
53:46;53:48;"would go on to eventually be,"

53:56;53:58;"weirdly just got, like, bigger and bigger."
53:58;54:00;"- Yeah, and when they came out, it did"
54:00;54:02;"seem like, ""Oh, these guys are this,"
54:02;54:04;"like, high-energy, like, fun, like,"
54:04;54:06;"kind of punk throwback."
54:06;54:08;"This probably won't, like,"

54:50;54:52;"I am legitimately curious,"

01:08:32;01:08:34;"a box of cigars, and I feel like maybe"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"they were Cubans. There's something"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"special about them. Like, maybe"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"someone was like, ""Oh, these are Cubans."" - So funny."

01:12:56;01:12:58;"this show's all over the place. Can I tell you"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"when I was watching the Jordan"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"doc, the part that I thought was so TC"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"was when he got—"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"Jordan"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"was at the '98 finals"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"in Salt Lake and he ordered a pizza"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"at 10.30 at night."
01:13:12;01:13:14;"It got the food"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"poisoned. The flu game."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"That was the best, because I was like,"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"""How is, like, the"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"best basketball player of all"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"time the night before game"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"six or seven, whatever the"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"hell it was?"" He's hungry."
01:13:28;01:13:30;"He's just like, ""Oh, man, I'm"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"hungry."" It's like,"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"10 at night, there's no room"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"service. They made that clear in the doc."
01:13:36;01:13:38;"Room service was closed. There's no,"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"like, team, like, concierge"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"or, like, chef or"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"someone, the handler that can, like,"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"deal with the situation."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"So they're calling, like, a"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"random pizza place"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"in, like, Provo, Utah."
01:13:52;01:13:54;"[laughter]"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And there's, like, five guys that show"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"up to the door."
01:13:58;01:14:00;"They got wise that, like, Jordan or, like,"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"the Bulls had ordered a pizza."
01:14:02;01:14:04;"It was so— - How did they put it together that it was—"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"- And also, like, I feel like"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"athletes now—and maybe I'm wrong, but, like,"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"are so tuned in with their diets and"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"stuff. - Well, yeah. You think about Tom Brady"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"who, in some ways, is, like,"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"almost as iconic as Jordan."
01:14:16;01:14:18;"- Well, not quite. - Not even"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"close. - No, no. Not even close. But I just think"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"in terms of, like, athletes who"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"just, like, win a lot, right?"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"- Sure, sure. Put up big numbers."
01:14:26;01:14:28;"- Right. 'Cause even LeBron"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"hasn't won as many championships"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"as Jordan, but Tom Brady has that in common"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"with him. But, yeah, when you think about Tom"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Brady in our era, and he's,"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"like, famously—he's, like, vegan and—"
01:14:38;01:14:40;"- Is he really?"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- I thought so. He's on some crazy diet"
01:14:42;01:14:44;"to, like, try to, like, slow down the aging"
01:14:44;01:14:46;"process. - The vegan"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"quarterback!"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- Vegan"
01:14:50;01:14:52;"quarterback! But, no, I know"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"what you mean, Jake. It was funny to also picture,"
01:14:54;01:14:56;"like, that moment"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"in food delivery."
01:14:58;01:15:00;"- Totally. - 'Cause, I mean, it's real."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"I mean, they were—obviously, they got screwed,"
01:15:02;01:15:04;"but that even the most"
01:15:04;01:15:06;"famous, richest athlete on the"
01:15:06;01:15:08;"planet has to still—"
01:15:08;01:15:10;"what's he gonna do? He's gotta stay at a hotel."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"He's playing in the championships."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"He's not gonna fly in that morning."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"And he's just"
01:15:16;01:15:18;"hungry. And if the hotel doesn't have food,"
01:15:18;01:15:20;"and even if there was a team chef"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"maybe asleep, it's just, like,"

01:15:50;01:15:52;"strict diet, I just picture, like,"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"obviously, Jordan was incredibly"

01:15:56;01:15:58;"practice and his game. I would just kind"

01:17:26;01:17:28;"And they were given terrible food, yeah. Yeah, it looked like airplane"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"food. It looked like what you might get on an Amtrak,"

01:18:02;01:18:04;"that was made, like, 80 hours ago?"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Like, on tour? Just"

01:18:08;01:18:10;"I mean, I've always been kind of,"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"like, into pre-made sandwiches, so, like,"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"the truth is, like,"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"I've got a somewhat refined palate."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"I know the difference between, like, going to, like, a great"

01:18:28;01:18:30;"tuna sandwich, and I pulled"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"it out, and, like, the bread was,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"like, kind of hard on the edges,"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"like, clearly it had been there a little. Yeah."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"I have, like, a hot cup of coffee."

01:18:52;01:18:54;"That's tight. Yeah, I'm totally down with a pre-made"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"sandwich. Jake, would you"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"hit, like, an egg salad sandwich at a gas station?"

01:19:06;01:19:08;"I had to. Right."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"I think I would, like, at a gas station,"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"if I'm on, like, a long drive,"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"I think I would hit, like, a Snickers bar."
01:19:14;01:19:16;"As you know, I'm a fan."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"And then I would buy, like, honestly,"

01:19:20;01:19:22;"Like, protein up style. I wouldn't..."
01:19:22;01:19:24;"I don't think I would gravitate towards the"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"egg salad sandwich. Yeah, it depends"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"what you're trying to do. Do you know what I mean? It is. Yeah, no."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"I've been in that funny position, too, to, like, stop"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"at a truck stop and be like, ""I'm trying"

01:19:48;01:19:50;"really... Like a Flying J. And, like..."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"Yeah. A Flying J"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"is, like, such classic, like, weird"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"deep West Coast, like, rural"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"highway vibes."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"You know, we've talked about how when we"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"get emails from listeners, it's... people"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"got all sorts of different jobs. You know?"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"We got everything from"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"chocolate makers to"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"Tampa PD detectives"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"to college students"

01:20:16;01:20:18;"I don't think we've ever gotten confirmation"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"that any truckers listen"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"to the program. And I'm just genuinely"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"curious if there's any"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"truckers who listen to TC. I only"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"think of it not because I think we're a natural..."
01:20:28;01:20:30;"Well, I think we are... we cover some"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"topics that the truckers"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"of America might find interesting."
01:20:34;01:20:36;"Perhaps. But I..."
01:20:36;01:20:38;"also, just, it's a job where you probably..."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"you know, similar to painter, Jake,"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"you could take down a lot of, uh,"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"talk radio and podcasts."
01:20:44;01:20:46;"And in that video..."
01:20:46;01:20:48;"Painters and truck drivers"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"account for"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"90% of all internet radio"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"and podcast listeners. Because"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"those are the two jobs where"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"you could just, like, look ahead, focus"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"on what you're doing, but also enjoy something"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"with your ears. A lot of other"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"jobs, you work at an office, you gotta be"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"typing up stuff. It's too confusing."
01:21:06;01:21:08;"Yeah. But anyway, if we have any"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"truckers listen to TC, please let us know."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"And especially, I'm interested in"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"if we have any, um,"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"truckers who love protein, who"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"try to keep down their carbs. I guess the"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"truth is, if you're a trucker, you could also just, you pack"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"all your food from home. But, like, when"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"you pull into that Flying J,"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"what are you getting there? You know, we did have a"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"trucker call in one time, or a former"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"trucker. Oh, right."
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Jerry Saltz,"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"former trucker. Former trucker."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"Current art critic."
01:21:36;01:21:38;"If we have any art critics turned truckers,"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"we especially want"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"to hear from you. Okay, well, we were"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"gonna... we had a great email from"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"a scientist, speaking of"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"the fascinating"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"jobs of TC listeners. We had, like, a"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"legitimate scientist who"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"sent us a great email about"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"Reese's, but we'll save that for next"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"time, because actually, we"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"finally have somebody from the Hershey's organization"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"who's down to call in."
01:22:02;01:22:04;"For next episode, right? For the next episode."
01:22:04;01:22:06;"So we can finally get to the bottom of this"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"question of, ""Do they change the formula?"""
01:22:08;01:22:10;"However, Matt, our producer,"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"he says that when he talked to"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"the people at Hershey's, they were very"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"down to send somebody from"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"their team to come beyond time crisis,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"but without even"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"waiting for the show, they said, ""But first things"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"first, we do not change our formula"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"between seasons."""
01:22:26;01:22:28;"And, um,"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"you know, it's a tough one. Like,"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"that's what they would say."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"You know what I mean? I hate living in a"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"post-truth society, because I want to believe"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"in people. Alright, so"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"somebody from Hershey's says they don't change the formula."
01:22:40;01:22:42;"Well, some super"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"tasters taste buds beg to differ."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Uh, look, we're gonna hear 'em out,"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"and hopefully we'll find some other stuff to talk about."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"I don't want this to be, like, a tense call."
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Maybe they're gonna pull out after they heard"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"me talking, but I don't want this to be a"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"tense call. I don't want this to be"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"some, like, weird"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"""meet the press"" intense vibe."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"I want it to be fun, but I'm just saying,"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"like, an organization's gonna say"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"what they want the people to think. Anyway,"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"we're excited to actually talk to somebody from Hershey's,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"but we did also get a great email,"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"which we'll get into next time, from an actual scientist"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"who's, like, studying the water content"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"of chocolate"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"and... Look, this stuff is just"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"very complicated. This is very complex,"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"folks. This is science."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"Music is an art form."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"Dookie is art. Reese's peanut"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"butter cups, that's science, folks."
01:23:28;01:23:30;"I'm picturing everything"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"you're saying as Trump."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Folks, this is... Yeah, I can't even remember"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"his voice. Thankfully, I heard his voice in there."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"- You're Obama? - Now, folks..."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"[laughs]"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"I can do a better Obama than Trump."
01:23:42;01:23:44;"Now, folks, it's all well and good"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"to talk about Dookie."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"I love Dookie. The late"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"great James Gandolfini loved Dookie."
01:23:50;01:23:52;"But it's an"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"art form. Pop punk albums"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"are an art form, but we"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"believe in science, and we're gonna"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"use that science to"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"prove that"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"Reese's changes their formula from"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"summer to winter. It's a believable"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"premise. [laughs]"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"Speaking of impressions,"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"I really only do impressions"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"on this show, or I guess, you know,"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"sometimes in conversation or something."
01:24:16;01:24:18;"It's not like I'm ever trying to work on an impression."
01:24:18;01:24:20;"It's like natural."
01:24:20;01:24:22;"We all do it. We're talking. We do"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"try to do a voice. But weirdly,"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"I did start trying to do a voice"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"the other day. I'm sure it was"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"very annoying to the people around me, but I just"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"really wanted to... For some"
01:24:32;01:24:34;"reason, it popped in my head to do the"
01:24:34;01:24:36;"old SNL announcer's voice."
01:24:36;01:24:38;"I just kept trying to see how... If I could"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"get his classic"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"word, which to me is... Let me"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"see if I can do it. ""Featuring!"""
01:24:44;01:24:46;"How was that? It's pretty good."
01:24:46;01:24:48;"""Musical guest!"""
01:24:48;01:24:50;"Don Pardo. Oh, that's pretty good."
01:24:50;01:24:52;"That's pretty good. Oh, yeah, Don Pardo."
01:24:52;01:24:54;"But there's something about this weird"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"kind of rhythm that comes out."
01:24:56;01:24:58;"""Featuring!"" Yeah. Jake Longstreet."
01:24:58;01:25:00;"No, I... Yeah."
01:25:00;01:25:02;"""Musical guest, Mountain"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"Brews!"""
01:25:04;01:25:06;"""Featuring! With musical"
01:25:06;01:25:08;"guest, Mountain Brews"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"and your host, Jake"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"Longstreet!"""
01:25:12;01:25:14;"It's a really bad impression, because I'm"
01:25:14;01:25:16;"bad at everything except for"
01:25:16;01:25:18;"""Featuring!"""
01:25:18;01:25:20;"Well, anyway. So, next week, we're going to"
01:25:20;01:25:22;"delve back into the"
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Hershey's Reese's world. In the meantime,"
01:25:24;01:25:26;"though, we've got to get into the Top 5."
01:25:26;01:25:28;"It's time for"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"the Top 5"
01:25:30;01:25:32;"on iTunes."
01:25:32;01:25:34;"So,"
01:25:34;01:25:36;"we're comparing the greatest"
01:25:36;01:25:38;"hits of"
01:25:38;01:25:40;"today with this week"
01:25:40;01:25:42;"in 1994."
01:25:42;01:25:44;"And why 1994? I legitimately don't"
01:25:44;01:25:46;"remember. ""Do you have the time?"""
01:25:46;01:25:48;"Oh, it's the year Dookie"
01:25:48;01:25:50;"came out. Alright, tight."
01:25:50;01:25:52;"So, everybody, I want you to picture a young"
01:25:52;01:25:54;"James Gandolfini, a struggling"
01:25:54;01:25:56;"actor, hearing this great"
01:25:56;01:25:58;"new record, Dookie. I imagine"
01:25:58;01:26:00;"he was probably living in New York, probably getting"
01:26:00;01:26:02;"some parts in"
01:26:02;01:26:04;"films and TV, probably also doing some"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"off-Broadway. This is what was happening in the larger"
01:26:06;01:26:08;"music world in 1994."
01:26:08;01:26:10;"The number 5 song,"
01:26:10;01:26:12;"""All For One, I Swear."""
01:26:12;01:26:14;"This is a great song."
01:26:14;01:26:16;"""I swear,"
01:26:16;01:26:18;"by the moon and the stars..."""
01:26:18;01:26:20;"Whoa, this was originally"
01:26:20;01:26:22;"recorded by a country artist in"
01:26:22;01:26:24;"1993, John Michael"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"Montgomery. Produced by"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"David Foster. Jake, you watch the David"
01:26:28;01:26:30;"Foster doc? I haven't yet."
01:26:30;01:26:32;"Catch me up on David Foster. Is"
01:26:32;01:26:34;"he known for, like, kind of"
01:26:34;01:26:36;"soft rock and R&B?"
01:26:36;01:26:38;"He's known for soft rock"
01:26:38;01:26:40;"and power ballads"
01:26:40;01:26:42;"and kind of like adult"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"contemporary. Did he produce, like,"
01:26:44;01:26:46;"80's Chicago?"
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Exactly. That was one of his big breakthroughs."
01:26:48;01:26:50;"He and Peter Sotero"
01:26:50;01:26:52;"are very close. Okay."
01:26:52;01:26:54;"You know what? I've heard this a million"
01:26:54;01:26:56;"times growing up. I'm kind of curious to hear the"
01:26:56;01:26:58;"original country version."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"Which is also interesting because David Foster also"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"took a country song, ""I Will Always Love"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"You,"" gave it to somebody"
01:27:04;01:27:06;"known more as a pop R&B"
01:27:06;01:27:08;"singer and turned it into one of the biggest songs"
01:27:08;01:27:10;"ever."
01:27:46;01:27:48;"Very pretty song."
01:27:48;01:27:53;"It really works in both, yeah, fascinating."
01:27:53;01:28:02;"And though I'll make mistakes, I'll never break your heart."
01:28:02;01:28:13;"I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky, I'll be there."
01:28:13;01:28:25;"I swear, like the shadow that's by your side, I'll be there."
01:28:25;01:28:36;"For better or worse, 'til death do us part, I'll love you with every beat of my heart."
01:28:36;01:28:38;"I swear."
01:28:38;01:28:45;"I always felt like there's something a little bit pagan about swearing by the moon and the"
01:28:45;01:28:46;"stars in the sun."
01:28:46;01:28:51;"This song always kind of stuck out to me of all the schmaltzy ballads from this time."
01:28:51;01:28:52;"It's like medieval."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"Yeah, connected to the earth cycles."
01:28:54;01:28:57;"Not God and heaven and love, not Jesus Christ."
01:28:57;01:29:01;"By the gravitational pull of the moon."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"Yeah."
01:29:02;01:29:07;"And also, I feel like when people swear on stuff in real life, I mean, to me, growing"
01:29:07;01:29:11;"up, when somebody would swear on stuff, the classic thing they would swear on would be"
01:29:11;01:29:12;"their mother."
01:29:12;01:29:15;"Is that your guys feeling like, ""Dude, I swear on my mother."""
01:29:15;01:29:18;"I feel like that's the classic thing to swear on."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"And obviously--"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"Or your life."
01:29:20;01:29:21;"I swear on my life."
01:29:21;01:29:22;"Yeah, I swear on my life."
01:29:22;01:29:25;"And then obviously in the courtroom, you swear on a Bible."
01:29:25;01:29:26;"But you know what I mean?"
01:29:26;01:29:27;"I swear to God."
01:29:28;01:29:29;"Oh, I swear to God."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"Yeah, that's obviously-- although that's usually exasperation."
01:29:31;01:29:35;"I swear to God, you are so f***ing annoying."
01:29:35;01:29:37;"I swear on my mother."
01:29:37;01:29:38;"I did not do that."
01:29:38;01:29:43;"Isn't it so trite that people in courts have to take an oath?"
01:29:43;01:29:44;"On the Bible?"
01:29:44;01:29:45;"No one takes that seriously."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"On the Bible or just whatever."
01:29:47;01:29:51;"Just like, ""I swear that what I'm saying is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."""
01:29:51;01:29:52;"Whatever, all that kind of stuff."
01:29:52;01:29:53;"Yeah, right."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"We could really dispense with that."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"It's just sort of like, whatever."
01:29:56;01:29:58;"People lie in court."
01:29:58;01:30:03;"No one respects the institution of the court if their self-interest is in jeopardy."
01:30:03;01:30:04;"It's hilarious."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"Yeah, it's a lie."
01:30:05;01:30:06;"Everybody's lie."
01:30:06;01:30:07;"You can't trust anybody in this world."
01:30:07;01:30:13;"Also, do you think there's ever been a court case where the jury was deliberating and one"
01:30:13;01:30:15;"of the jurors said, ""That guy is full of s***."""
01:30:15;01:30:18;"And then somebody said, ""Well, hold on a second."
01:30:18;01:30:19;"He swore on the Bible."""
01:30:19;01:30:20;"He swore."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"Yeah, or I could imagine also somebody being like, ""I don't know if you noticed, that guy"
01:30:23;01:30:24;"was wearing the cross."""
01:30:24;01:30:25;"Oh, I'm sure that's happened."
01:30:25;01:30:28;"Just somebody rolled up with a giant cross and they put their hand on the Bible and closed"
01:30:28;01:30:29;"their eyes."
01:30:29;01:30:30;"It'd get really dramatic."
01:30:30;01:30:33;"""I swear to tell the whole truth."""
01:30:33;01:30:34;"I mean..."
01:30:34;01:30:36;"And then proceed to lie there."
01:30:36;01:30:40;"Yeah, if you were going to go into court and plan on lying, that would be the way to do"
01:30:40;01:30:41;"it, right?"
01:30:41;01:30:45;"Wear a cross and make a whole production about swearing to Jesus Christ and God that you're"
01:30:45;01:30:46;"telling the truth."
01:30:46;01:30:49;"It would honestly be more effective to make people swear on their mother."
01:30:49;01:30:50;"It's true."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"This sounds like a satirical joke."
01:30:52;01:30:57;"Like if every time a witness was taken to the stand, they also brought their..."
01:30:57;01:31:00;"If she was alive, they brought their mother to the courtroom and she had to introduce"
01:31:00;01:31:05;"themselves and talk about, ""I gave birth to this person 47 years ago."
01:31:05;01:31:08;"He was a good boy, got in a little bit of trouble."""
01:31:08;01:31:11;"And sit there and then be like, ""Put your hand on your mother."
01:31:11;01:31:14;"Do you swear on your mother that you will tell the whole truth?"""
01:31:14;01:31:21;"That would actually be way more dramatic and emotional than putting your hand on this random"
01:31:21;01:31:22;"book."
01:31:22;01:31:23;"What does it even mean to..."
01:31:23;01:31:29;"I could understand if you made somebody read a Bible verse or brought in some clergy."
01:31:29;01:31:33;"But just putting your hand on the book, it's like, ""Come on, folks."
01:31:33;01:31:34;"Let's get rid of it."""
01:31:34;01:31:35;"Ezra, it's not a random book."
01:31:35;01:31:36;"It's the Bible."
01:31:36;01:31:38;"I'm doing my best Ben Shapiro there."
01:31:38;01:31:40;"It's not a random book, Ezra."
01:31:40;01:31:41;"Okay?"
01:31:41;01:31:42;"That's pretty good."
01:31:42;01:31:43;"That was a good Ben Shapiro."
01:31:43;01:31:46;"I only know Ben Shapiro because of other..."
01:31:46;01:31:50;"I've never actually listened or watched whatever his show is."
01:31:50;01:31:53;"I'm aware of him because of clips on other shows."
01:31:53;01:31:57;"That's how I've seen him, is when he goes to debate somebody on a TV show."
01:31:57;01:32:02;"The number five song in 2020, Juice WRLD and The Weeknd's ""Smile."""
01:32:02;01:32:10;"And if you recall, this is from Juice WRLD's posthumous album, Legends Never Die."
01:32:10;01:32:12;"Crazy title."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"Was it titled before he died?"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"That's a good question."
01:32:15;01:32:19;"I just assumed no, but stranger things have happened."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"What?"
01:32:43;01:32:46;"Devil on my shoulder telling me I'll die soon?"
01:32:46;01:32:48;"Wait, I'm sorry if this is dumb."
01:32:48;01:32:52;"Is Juice WRLD the dude that got home invaded in LA?"
01:32:52;01:32:54;"No, that's Pop Smoke."
01:32:54;01:32:55;"Sorry, my bad."
01:32:55;01:32:59;"No, there have been so many deaths."
01:32:59;01:33:02;"There have been a lot of deaths in the music world, and particularly rappers."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"Even a few years ago, there was XXXTentacion."
01:33:05;01:33:08;"Of 21-year-old rappers."
01:33:08;01:33:10;"Yeah, big names."
01:33:10;01:33:14;"Juice WRLD, I think, died of supposedly some type of drug thing."
01:33:14;01:33:20;"He had a drug overdose when he landed on the tarmac in Chicago."
01:33:20;01:33:26;"For some reason, I found myself reading this LA Times article about the Pop Smoke murder."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"It was so intense, man."
01:33:28;01:33:33;"He accidentally disclosed his location through an Instagram post, I think."
01:33:33;01:33:35;"They're not totally sure."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"That was the theory."
01:33:36;01:33:40;"Yeah, he posted a package he got and it said the address on it, right?"
01:33:40;01:33:47;"Yeah, he was just oblivious to that he had accidentally disclosed his location."
01:33:47;01:33:51;"People figured it out and went there and robbed him and killed him."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"It was so intense, man."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"Yeah, it's so brutal."
01:33:55;01:34:00;"He was young and already really big, but he was just exploding."
01:34:00;01:34:03;"He was on his way to becoming this gigantic rapper."
01:34:03;01:34:06;"Sorry to bring it down, but..."
01:34:06;01:34:07;"No, it's all good."
01:34:07;01:34:10;"That article really affected me."
01:34:10;01:34:11;"Anyway, sorry, '94."
01:34:11;01:34:14;"Well, Pop Smoke is all over this top five, too."
01:34:14;01:34:16;"So we'll be getting into some Pop Smoke."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"But that was in February that he died."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"He was murdered."
01:34:19;01:34:21;"He had a posthumous album as well."
01:34:21;01:34:24;"Maybe that's why I was reading this article."
01:34:24;01:34:25;"Okay."
01:34:25;01:34:27;"Well, back in '94, the number four song..."
01:34:27;01:34:28;"This is a good one."
01:34:28;01:34:31;"John Mellencamp featuring Michelle and Deji Ocello."
01:34:31;01:34:32;"Okay."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"This came up last episode."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"Yeah, we did talk about this."
01:34:36;01:34:39;"This is originally a Van Morrison song from 1971."
01:34:39;01:34:43;"The Haim family band covered this at Canter's."
01:34:43;01:34:44;"Rockin' Haim."
01:34:44;01:34:50;"God, this sucks."
01:34:50;01:34:51;"Whoa, really?"
01:34:51;01:34:54;"I love the original, but this sounds awful."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"The bass tone is so corny."
01:34:57;01:35:00;"The drum tone, terrible."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"Harsh."
01:35:01;01:35:03;"And you know, not a Mellencamp fan."
01:35:03;01:35:05;"What about Michelle?"
01:35:05;01:35:07;"I don't know who Michelle is."
01:35:07;01:35:09;"I only know her through this song."
01:35:09;01:35:11;"She made her own music, you know."
01:35:11;01:35:12;"A bassist, singer."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"She has some cool stuff."
01:35:13;01:35:16;"I remember this being on MTV a lot when I used to watch MTV."
01:35:16;01:35:17;"Yeah."
01:35:17;01:35:19;"I was like full butthead mode."
01:35:19;01:35:21;"I was like, ""Ugh, this sucks."""
01:35:21;01:35:23;"And I'm basically still there."
01:35:23;01:35:26;"You've been hating on this for over 25 years."
01:35:26;01:35:27;"Yes."
01:35:27;01:35:30;"I haven't heard it in at least 20 years."
01:35:30;01:35:33;"It honestly sounds way worse than I would have thought."
01:35:33;01:35:38;"This sounds like it's from the soundtrack of a box office bomb from the '90s."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"It's like the second song that plays in the credits."
01:35:41;01:35:42;"Absolutely."
01:35:42;01:35:44;"Yeah, the second song."
01:35:44;01:35:46;"I'm not mad at it."
01:35:46;01:35:51;"Like the part of the credits where it's just all of the publishing rights to the songs that were used."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"That's right."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"Yes."
01:35:53;01:35:56;"That's a bummer."
01:35:56;01:35:59;"Why was that a hit and why did they cover that?"
01:35:59;01:36:00;"That makes no sense."
01:36:00;01:36:04;"Well, John Mellencamp just said it's a song he always loved and he thought it'd be kind of fun."
01:36:04;01:36:05;"Cool, bro."
01:36:05;01:36:06;"I still don't hate it."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"I mean, maybe it's just nostalgia."
01:36:08;01:36:09;"That's cool."
01:36:09;01:36:11;"Thank you."
01:36:11;01:36:14;"[Laughter]"
01:36:14;01:36:21;"That's super cool you like that Mellencamp cover of the Van Morrison song from '94."
01:36:21;01:36:22;"Thank you."
01:36:22;01:36:23;"Oh, man."
01:36:23;01:36:24;"This sucks."
01:36:24;01:36:25;"Oh, really, man?"
01:36:25;01:36:26;"I like it."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"That's cool."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Thank you."
01:36:29;01:36:32;"[Laughter]"
01:36:32;01:36:33;"That's serious."
01:36:33;01:36:34;"This show rules."
01:36:34;01:36:37;"[Laughter]"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"That could be the Time Crisis TV show."
01:36:39;01:36:42;"It's like an animated show and it's just like Beavis and Butthead."
01:36:42;01:36:43;"Oh, yeah."
01:36:43;01:36:47;"Instead of them being all violent and be like, ""Shut up, Beavis."""
01:36:47;01:36:49;"It's way more like kind vibe."
01:36:49;01:36:52;"It's like, ""Oh, dude. You're making a good point there."""
01:36:52;01:36:57;"Yeah, just like two Beavis and Butthead animated versions of us watching the Wild Knight video"
01:36:57;01:37:02;"and you're just like, ""Not feeling this, man. This sounds terrible."""
01:37:02;01:37:03;"This is weak."
01:37:03;01:37:05;"Really, man? I kind of like it."
01:37:05;01:37:07;"Well, that's cool."
01:37:07;01:37:08;"All right."
01:37:08;01:37:10;"[Laughter]"
01:37:10;01:37:12;"The next song is DaBaby Rockstar."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"We've listened to this a million times."
01:37:14;01:37:15;"This song is massive."
01:37:15;01:37:17;"I like DaBaby."
01:37:17;01:37:19;"Let's go back to '94."
01:37:19;01:37:23;"The '94 song at number three."
01:37:23;01:37:26;"Coolio with ""Fantastic Voyage."""
01:37:26;01:37:28;"Sick."
01:37:28;01:37:29;"Great track."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"Already sounds great."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"Do you remember the music video for this song?"
01:37:33;01:37:35;"Is he riding a bike in it?"
01:37:35;01:37:39;"I think that might be ""1234"" from the Gangstas Paradise album."
01:37:39;01:37:45;"This one, I just remember he pulls up to the beach with some classic California convertible"
01:37:45;01:37:50;"and all these people are getting out of the back, getting out of the trunk in a clown car."
01:37:50;01:37:52;"Oh, kind of. Yeah."
01:37:52;01:37:59;"And so this song is heavily indebted to and samples an original song called ""Fantastic Voyage"""
01:37:59;01:38:02;"by Lakeside, a funk group from the early '80s."
01:38:02;01:38:06;"I like that he was sampling something that was only like 12 years old."
01:38:06;01:38:07;"Right."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"I'm looking at the notes."
01:38:32;01:38:40;"It says, ""In 2010, Chrysler released a music video featuring Coolio called 'Fantastic Voyage'"
01:38:40;01:38:43;"to promote the Chrysler Pacifica minivan."""
01:38:43;01:38:44;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:38:44;01:38:46;"Wait, we got to throw that on."
01:38:46;01:38:51;"I was also thinking, Coolio, it's crazy how hard he fell off."
01:38:51;01:38:57;"Was it just because that ""Dangerous Mind"" song got too big and people just wouldn't give him a chance?"
01:38:57;01:39:00;"He was a multiple hit dude."
01:39:00;01:39:04;"It's crazy how much he kind of, I don't know, became a punchline."
01:39:04;01:39:05;"He just got too big."
01:39:05;01:39:10;"[Phone buzzing]"
01:39:10;01:39:13;"What are you doing, dude? Let's get the guys and go to the beach."
01:39:13;01:39:15;"How are we supposed to get there?"
01:39:15;01:39:17;"My wife took the car, fool."
01:39:17;01:39:18;"Oh, no."
01:39:18;01:39:20;"Rough."
01:39:20;01:39:22;"My wife took the car, fool."
01:39:35;01:39:37;"Oh, he sounds rough, huh?"
01:39:37;01:39:38;"Yeah."
01:39:47;01:39:49;"Okay, I've heard enough."
01:39:49;01:39:50;"Damn, this is raw."
01:39:50;01:39:51;"Oh, it's so bad."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"That was truly buff."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"It was rough stuff."
01:39:54;01:40:00;"The number three song in 2020, now here's the Pop Smoke song featuring Lil Baby and DaBaby."
01:40:00;01:40:03;"So, wait, this is featuring multiple babies?"
01:40:03;01:40:06;"Lil Baby and DaBaby, two of the biggest rappers right now."
01:40:06;01:40:21;"What's very eerie about this album and the Juice WRLD album is that literally the entire album from Pop Smoke is about basically the thing that he's going to be killed for and the exact same thing with Juice."
01:40:21;01:40:33;"They're both almost solely about, you know, whether it's the violence in the home invasion or his drug addiction, like, in like a very kind of like profound and myopic way."
01:40:33;01:40:34;"Jeez."
01:41:08;01:41:18;"The number two song in 1994, another classic, Boyz II Men, ""I'll Make Love to You."""
01:41:18;01:41:24;"I don't always know every song in the 90s top five, but this time so far I really do."
01:41:24;01:41:30;"It's funny the only rock song so far is that crap Mellon can't remember."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"Jay, were you a Boyz II Men fan back then?"
01:41:33;01:41:34;"No, I wasn't in."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"It's kind of like too soft, you know?"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Yeah."
01:41:38;01:41:39;"Too smulty."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"I mean, you're literally listening to Dookie at this moment in time."
01:41:53;01:42:01;"The Motown Philly side of Boyz II Men, a little more high energy, but I think they just had these monster ballads that kind of took over."
01:42:01;01:42:12;"I mean, I did like like fun songs from the era that were like in the rap R&B genre, whether it was like En Vogue or like, you know, Jitter Juice or whatever."
01:42:12;01:42:19;"But like this kind of stuff, it was just like, I mean, beautiful singing, but it's kind of easy listening."
01:42:19;01:42:22;"What's the BPM on this, you think? Like 60?"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"Yeah, it's very slow."
01:42:28;01:42:32;"I'm going to go to a BPM tap website and see what it says."
01:42:42;01:42:46;"I mean, I'm getting something in the 50s. Maybe I got to go double time and then divide."
01:42:56;01:43:01;"Well, it's in 6/8. I'm confused now. It's slow."
01:43:01;01:43:07;"All right. I don't understand what 6/8 is. How do you know what's in 6/8? Does it say that on the Internet?"
01:43:07;01:43:14;"Well, I might be wrong, but it's just because it's got that feel of one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two."
01:43:14;01:43:20;"Wait, is 6/8 the same thing as 3/4? Is it like, Algebra or whatever? Proportional?"
01:43:20;01:43:27;"Well, it's not necessarily because something could be in 3/4 and be like one, two, three, two, two, three."
01:43:27;01:43:33;"And then a 6/8 feel because it's eighth notes is that da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
01:43:33;01:43:36;"So it specifically implies like a unit of two."
01:43:36;01:43:43;"So yeah, I guess like at different tempos, you could call things, you know, double it or divide it."
01:43:43;01:43:51;"Huh. Because I think of 3/4 as like your classic, like that's like a waltz. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, you know."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"Yeah."
01:43:52;01:44:00;"Where 6/8 I thought of is like a more subtle description of a variation on 4/4 than like I have the bandwidth for."
01:44:00;01:44:06;"Well, also something could be, you can count it in four, but it could still be subdivided by three."
01:44:06;01:44:08;"Getting real inside baseball here."
01:44:08;01:44:14;"Is there some like actual real music heads listening to this or just like, oh my God, these guys are morons."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"Ezra knows literally nothing about music."
01:44:16;01:44:24;"No, I mean, I just think of it's like, you know, there's times when you count something and if you subdivide, be like one, two, one, one and two and three and four."
01:44:24;01:44:29;"Da, da, da, da, eighth notes versus one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six."
01:44:29;01:44:36;"The number two song in 2020, another Pop Smoke song called Mood Swings."
01:44:36;01:44:42;"I mean, it's just kind of heavy listening to this posthumous music, you know, rest in peace, Pop Smoke."
01:44:59;01:45:04;"I read about this album, I think, in the New Yorker."
01:45:04;01:45:07;"I felt like the most like middle-aged guy ever."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"Like just because like you knew none of the people involved."
01:45:10;01:45:17;"Yeah, I don't. I remember hearing about Pop Smoke being murdered, but like I wasn't familiar with him when he was killed."
01:45:17;01:45:20;"And then, yeah, I just it's not my world."
01:45:20;01:45:27;"So like I remember it just felt like, wow, I'm a middle-aged guy like reading about this rapper in the New Yorker."
01:45:27;01:45:34;"Like something about like the New Yorker, like in that New Yorker, like canonizing and like."
01:45:34;01:45:38;"Well, it's also fun. Yeah, it's just funny to be like, oh, yeah, I read about that in the New Yorker."
01:45:38;01:45:46;"It's just like maybe everybody eventually hits an age where you can read about a person and find their story interesting."
01:45:46;01:45:51;"And obviously, in the case of Pop Smoke, the story is very sad and dramatic."
01:45:51;01:45:56;"But you probably eventually hit a point where it's like, you know, you're still a human being."
01:45:56;01:45:59;"You're interested in culture and people and the lives of others."
01:45:59;01:46:06;"But you could also hit a point where you're like, wow, this is really interesting article about this dude I never heard of who was like about to blow up."
01:46:06;01:46:09;"He was tragically killed and blah, blah, blah. And be like, what do you think of the music?"
01:46:09;01:46:13;"I don't listen to music. Like, are you going to?"
01:46:13;01:46:16;"No, I don't need to. It's an interesting story."
01:46:16;01:46:25;"And I'm sorry what happened to them. But like, you know, you reach a point where it's like you maybe just pass the window where you can like wrap your head around some new music."
01:46:25;01:46:28;"Gandalfini would listen to the music."
01:46:28;01:46:30;"Well, he was only 33. Wait, how old are you?"
01:46:30;01:46:36;"Yeah. No, wait, I'm 43. I mean, I've heard the music on Time Crisis."
01:46:36;01:46:40;"Yeah. It didn't occur to me to be like, let me check this Pop Smoke record out."
01:46:40;01:46:46;"When he was your age, it would have been 2004. Did he go get the first Kanye album?"
01:46:46;01:46:47;"Hell no."
01:46:47;01:46:59;"Or at that point, was he just like too much of an older dude focused on his work, happy to go listen to his dookie vinyl, probably had a family, less time to keep up on new stuff."
01:46:59;01:47:05;"The number one song in '94. Oh, this is a big one. I don't know if we've ever talked about this."
01:47:05;01:47:09;"Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories, ""Stay."""
01:47:09;01:47:10;"Wow."
01:47:10;01:47:12;"In parentheses, ""I Missed You."""
01:47:12;01:47:18;"Loeb was discovered by Ethan Hawke, who lived in an apartment across the street from New York."
01:47:18;01:47:19;"Weird."
01:47:19;01:47:25;"I still can't remember if I've ever seen the movie Reality Bites. Have you, Derek?"
01:47:25;01:47:28;"I mean, not in 25 years."
01:47:28;01:47:29;"Yeah."
01:47:29;01:47:31;"It's a good movie."
01:47:31;01:47:36;"It'd be cool to watch Reality Bites in singles. Do like a 90s movies."
01:47:36;01:47:37;"Yeah."
01:47:37;01:47:41;"I think I've seen both those movies. I just never remember. I'm down for that."
01:47:41;01:47:46;"All right, let's watch Reality Bites in singles for next episode."
01:47:46;01:47:52;"Hey, Jake, do you remember Matt Dillon's band, the fictional band's name from singles?"
01:47:52;01:47:54;"I haven't seen that since the 90s."
01:47:54;01:47:58;"Neither have I, but it stuck with me. Citizen Dick."
01:47:58;01:47:59;"Okay."
01:47:59;01:48:04;"Oh, really? That sounds familiar. If you told me Citizen Dick was a real band, I'd be like, ""Oh, yeah, I've heard of them."""
01:48:04;01:48:06;"Exactly."
01:48:06;01:48:15;"So what's up with Ethan Hawke? Like, ""Oh, there's this cute girl in my apartment building. She's playing shows down at the coffee shop."""
01:48:15;01:48:17;"It's a good song."
01:48:17;01:48:23;"He gave a tape to director Ben Stiller, and Stiller subsequently agreed to use the song in the film."
01:48:23;01:48:26;"Wow. Ethan Hawke created the number one hit."
01:48:26;01:48:37;"You know, it's kind of weird. We were talking about the story of how it was Kevin Costner's idea to open ""I Will Always Love You"" from the Bodyguard soundtrack, Whitney Houston version."
01:48:37;01:48:45;"And that's part of the story is that David Foster, the producer, was like, ""That's insane. Radio's never going to play that. That's like a full minute of acapella."""
01:48:45;01:48:50;"And Kevin Costner was like, ""I don't know, man. I think it'd be cool."" And then Dave Foster's like, ""And you know what?"""
01:48:50;01:48:51;"It worked."
01:48:51;01:49:04;"It worked. It worked. One of the biggest songs of all time. It is just funny to think about just like these random dude, like, actor-directors like Kevin Costner and Ben Stiller and Ethan Hawke just like creating smash hits."
01:49:04;01:49:05;"They've got taste."
01:49:05;01:49:16;"It just goes to show how like random everything is. Like, if Ethan Hawke was not in the same building as Lisa Loeb, like, we literally would never have heard ""Stay."""
01:49:41;01:49:45;"Wait, so Jake, do you like the song ""Stay""? Do you have fond memories of listening to it in 1994?"
01:49:45;01:49:54;"No, I mean, it's cool. It's cute. I mean, it's like a cute, like, catchy little song. It's a sweet little song, you know? It's like..."
01:49:54;01:50:01;"It's just like very atypical, Jake. It's like, ""It's a cute little song. It's a sweet little song."""
01:50:01;01:50:08;"Yeah. I mean, it's better than ""Wild Night"" by Don Mellencamp, for sure."
01:50:08;01:50:13;"Jake, if you had to choose between ""Stay"" and ""Torn"" by Natalie Imbruglia, which one would you choose?"
01:50:13;01:50:15;"""Torn."""
01:50:15;01:50:16;"Really?"
01:50:16;01:50:17;"Yeah, ""Torn"" is a good track."
01:50:17;01:50:21;"Man, that's a tough one. They have a lot in common. Very similar vibe."
01:50:21;01:50:33;"I like ""Stay."" It just goes to show. I mean, it's like, if she had not lived in the same building as Ethan Hawke, like, it'd be obscure. It'd be in her notebooks. It'd be in her head. And like, maybe a few of her friends would know it."
01:50:33;01:50:36;"Well, yeah, it is crazy. She wasn't even signed."
01:50:36;01:50:37;"It's just like..."
01:50:37;01:50:40;"She's an unsigned singer-songwriter."
01:50:40;01:50:52;"It's wild. It reminds me of, like, talking about, like, GBV or something. Just like, forget about Bob Pollard. How many Lisa Loebs are there out there that, like, weren't neighbors with Ethan Hawke?"
01:50:52;01:51:03;"Right. You gotta ask yourself, how many Lisa Loebs are out there? How many Lisa Loebs did not have the fortune of living in the same apartment building as Ethan Hawke?"
01:51:03;01:51:10;"You gotta ask yourself, folks, is that fair? There might be a Lisa Loeb in your building."
01:51:10;01:51:21;"And that's why we are giving every potential Lisa Loeb a chance to audition for Ethan Hawke. The government's paying for it."
01:51:21;01:51:28;"That's becoming like a weird combination of Obama and Trump. The government's paying for it, folks. You're gonna love it."
01:51:28;01:51:33;"I could picture Trump, like, randomly being in to stay by Lisa Loeb."
01:51:33;01:51:38;"Wasn't there, like, a thing on the internet recently where, like, Trump was like, ""Oh, yeah, I like Neil Young,"" but then he couldn't name one song?"
01:51:38;01:51:41;"He's like, ""Oh, yeah, like, the old stuff."""
01:51:41;01:51:48;"No, wait. We actually gotta look that up. This is, like, classic. We talked about this offline, and it was so TC."
01:51:48;01:51:49;"Right, right."
01:51:49;01:51:57;"I think it was something... I mean, it's classic because... I'm not gonna be able to find it, but my memory was that they asked him, like, ""So you like Neil?"""
01:51:57;01:51:59;"""Oh, yeah, he's tremendous,"" or something."
01:51:59;01:52:03;"""What's one of your favorite songs?"" He's like, ""Oh, I don't know if I could pick a favorite, but..."""
01:52:03;01:52:08;"And they're like, ""Are you sure? Just name a song you like."" You know, just giving him any..."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"All he has to do is name one Neil Young song."
01:52:10;01:52:13;"And I feel like he said something that was, like, weirdly, like, astute."
01:52:13;01:52:20;"And he goes, ""Well, I think if I had to pick, I'd probably pick one of the earlier songs."""
01:52:20;01:52:31;"You know, like, a lot of people, the artist's earlier work sometimes has a special place for people, and it's harder for the later work to hit quite the same way."
01:52:31;01:52:33;"So probably an earlier tune."
01:52:33;01:52:39;"He just says something, like, so weird, where he, like... It was just such a funny statement for Trump to make."
01:52:39;01:52:45;"Like, a vaguely astute, like, understanding that with many artists, people love the early sh*t."
01:52:45;01:52:50;"Like, he's aware that it's a cliche to say, ""Oh, I like the early sh*t."""
01:52:50;01:52:54;"I feel like he said something like, ""Funny how that is. Many of us prefer the early work."""
01:52:54;01:52:58;"It's classic Trump, you know? I mean, like..."
01:52:58;01:53:04;"Oh, no! F*ck, Jake. I just remembered. I finally remembered why you and I were so excited to talk about this."
01:53:04;01:53:09;"It wasn't just that Trump said, ""I prefer the early stuff. Isn't it funny how people do?"""
01:53:09;01:53:13;"He then said, ""It's kind of like that song 'Garden Party'."""
01:53:13;01:53:14;"That's it."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Which we talked about on the show not that long ago."
01:53:16;01:53:20;"Just a great late career hit for Ricky Nelson."
01:53:20;01:53:25;"Which, fascinatingly enough, is the number one hit that he wrote, not in the early phase of his career,"
01:53:25;01:53:30;"but about that feeling of, like, people only wanting to hear the early sh*t,"
01:53:30;01:53:32;"and you can't please everyone, so you gotta please yourself."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"That's what was so strange about it, was Trump not just..."
01:53:35;01:53:40;"Yeah, typical Trump, talking out of his ass, getting caught in a lie, not knowing any Neil Young song,"
01:53:40;01:53:44;"but then just out of nowhere being like, ""Yeah, I guess I like the early stuff."""
01:53:44;01:53:48;"It kind of makes you think about that song, ""Garden Party."""
01:53:48;01:53:50;"Like, this is so weird."
01:53:50;01:53:56;"Obviously, that's a famous song, but it is also funny to be a dude who literally can't name one Neil Young song,"
01:53:56;01:54:02;"and then be like, ""Ricky Nelson wrote about the journey of an artist poignantly in the song 'Garden Party,'"
01:54:02;01:54:06;"and the difficulties of overcoming a successful early career."""
01:54:06;01:54:12;"It's just that bizarre Trump, to just pull that one out of left field, so strange."
01:54:12;01:54:16;"It's on brand for Trump, the fact that he can't name one Neil Young song,"
01:54:16;01:54:20;"who's sort of a cool, kind of edgy guy,"
01:54:20;01:54:25;"and Rick Nelson is the most milk-toast, white-bread, suburban..."
01:54:25;01:54:33;"I mean, I love Rick Nelson, but it is the most down-the-middle, white-bread, suburban stuff ever."
01:54:33;01:54:38;"I totally picture, too, hopefully, Trump leaving the White House,"
01:54:38;01:54:42;"he loses the election, he gets in his limousine, going to the PJ,"
01:54:42;01:54:46;"and just like, ""Well, Melania, I tried."""
01:54:46;01:54:50;"In his head, definitely, he'd just be like, ""I tried to make this country great again."
01:54:50;01:54:54;"You would not believe these nasty people who wouldn't let me do it. Oh, I hate Donald."""
01:54:54;01:54:57;"And then he's just like, ""I want to throw my earbuds in."""
01:54:57;01:55:02;"And just puts on Ricky Nelson, just leaving Washington, D.C."

01:58:09;01:58:11;"Just the most simple thing in the world, which is people"
01:58:11;01:58:13;"having sex, but to like,"
01:58:13;01:58:15;"make this like, big epic thing about it."
01:58:15;01:58:17;"I guess that's just human nature."

01:58:23;01:58:25;"like a big epic video."
01:58:25;01:58:27;"For a song that's really just like,"
01:58:27;01:58:29;"a fun, dirty song."
01:58:29;01:58:31;"I like that contrast."
01:58:31;01:58:32;"It's hilarious."

01:58:34;01:58:36;"kind of mundane things."
01:58:36;01:58:37;"Besides sex."
01:58:37;01:58:39;"I'll make a sandwich."
01:58:39;01:58:41;"It'd be like if Ween was getting three million dollars"
01:58:41;01:58:43;"to make videos for like,"
01:58:43;01:58:45;"you know, a song about a sandwich or something."
01:58:45;01:58:48;"It is just like, funny that sex still is this like,"
01:58:48;01:58:50;"weird third rail."
01:58:50;01:58:52;"And also, it is funny to think that"
01:58:52;01:58:54;"2 Live Crew was like, 30 years ago,"
01:58:54;01:58:56;"and I like big butts and stuff,"
01:58:56;01:58:58;"and that somehow, it's like,"
01:58:58;01:59:00;"every possible taboo has been broken."
01:59:00;01:59:02;"Like, if 30 years ago,"
01:59:02;01:59:04;"it was hard to imagine somebody who made a sex tape,"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"having a thriving career,"
01:59:06;01:59:08;"or a porn star,"
01:59:08;01:59:10;"going on to do other things."
01:59:10;01:59:12;"All these things that might have seemed impossible by the"
01:59:12;01:59:14;"kind of restrictive cultural standards."
01:59:14;01:59:16;"All those glass ceilings have been busted through."
01:59:16;01:59:18;"But if there's something about sex where it's like,"
01:59:18;01:59:21;"there's this human need to always have a line."
01:59:21;01:59:23;"It's like the line can never vanish."
01:59:23;01:59:26;"It can get like, rearranged or something,"
01:59:26;01:59:28;"but we're still..."
01:59:28;01:59:30;"Like, you would think that if 2 Live Crew was 30 years ago,"
01:59:30;01:59:33;"by now, nobody would care."
01:59:33;01:59:35;"They'd be like, ""Alright, well, talk about sex."
01:59:35;01:59:37;"I don't care."
01:59:37;01:59:38;"It's no big deal."""
01:59:38;01:59:39;"Like, you know what I mean?"
01:59:39;01:59:41;"Well, especially with like,"
01:59:41;01:59:43;"Pornhub on everyone's phone."
01:59:43;01:59:45;"Right."
01:59:45;01:59:47;"Like, you know Ben Shapiro is like,"
01:59:47;01:59:49;"""F***, for sure."""
01:59:49;01:59:52;"And it's like, ""Cool, man. Right on. Do that."""
01:59:52;01:59:54;"Right. Well, it's the culture, Ezra."
01:59:54;01:59:56;"What you're not understanding is the culture."
01:59:56;01:59:58;"This is a coarsening of the culture."
01:59:58;02:00:00;"At least 30 years ago,"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"when you would see somebody pretend"
02:00:02;02:00:05;"that they were this kind of asexual type person,"
02:00:05;02:00:08;"I guess you could almost take them at their word."
02:00:08;02:00:10;"But yeah, like today,"
02:00:10;02:00:12;"what is this bizarre performance?"
02:00:12;02:00:14;"I love Cardi B."
02:00:14;02:00:18;"She's truly one of the most charming,"
02:00:18;02:00:21;"fun, talented figures in a long time."
02:00:21;02:00:23;"But it's also kind of like,"
02:00:23;02:00:24;"at the end of the day,"
02:00:24;02:00:26;"Cardi B and Ben Shapiro,"
02:00:26;02:00:28;"and anybody on the street,"
02:00:28;02:00:30;"they're all just human beings"
02:00:30;02:00:32;"who probably have fairly similar sex drives."
02:00:32;02:00:35;"They might have drastically different sex lives,"
02:00:35;02:00:37;"and they might look up different s*** on the internet."
02:00:37;02:00:38;"You know what I mean?"
02:00:38;02:00:40;"It's just such a hilarious thing"
02:00:40;02:00:43;"that Cardi B is choosing as an artist"
02:00:43;02:00:47;"to make a song that really plays up her sexuality."
02:00:47;02:00:48;"But at the end of the day,"
02:00:48;02:00:52;"her instinct to talk about horny s***"
02:00:52;02:00:54;"is not that different than any other human being."
02:00:54;02:00:56;"And Ben Shapiro,"
02:00:56;02:00:59;"he's got the same hard wiring as most people,"
02:00:59;02:01:00;"but he's got to play this other..."
02:01:00;02:01:01;"It just feels like this bizarre..."
02:01:01;02:01:04;"Everybody's playing these roles."
02:01:04;02:01:06;"It just never ends."
02:01:06;02:01:08;"I can totally picture in 30 years,"
02:01:08;02:01:11;"there's still this weird culture war."
02:01:11;02:01:13;"Maybe there have been some ripples,"
02:01:13;02:01:15;"but there's still just like..."
02:01:15;02:01:19;"I guess there's been a big hit about butts in our lifetime."
02:01:19;02:01:21;"Maybe this will be kind of breaking new ground"
02:01:21;02:01:24;"for songs about wet-ass s***."
02:01:24;02:01:26;"But whatever the next thing is,"
02:01:26;02:01:27;"it'll happen."
02:01:27;02:01:29;"And I have this weird feeling in 30 years,"
02:01:29;02:01:30;"it'll be like the same."
02:01:30;02:01:32;"The lines will be drawn in the exact same way."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"Yeah."
02:01:33;02:01:35;"I'll be in my 70s."
02:01:35;02:01:36;"Yep."
02:01:36;02:01:39;"There'll be some song about"
02:01:39;02:01:41;"someone's hard-ass s*** or whatever."
02:01:41;02:01:44;"[Laughs]"
02:01:44;02:01:45;"Somebody's going to complain about it."

02:01:46;02:01:49;"""No, this is exactly what the culture needs."""
02:01:49;02:01:50;"And I'll be like,"
02:01:50;02:01:52;"""Oh, I remember 60 years ago,"
02:01:52;02:01:54;"being on the playground in middle school,"

02:01:57;02:01:59;"[Laughs]"

02:02:01;02:02:02;"I'm trying to remember."
02:02:02;02:02:03;"I don't even remember."
02:02:03;02:02:05;"It was the one that had the Miso Horny sample."
02:02:05;02:02:06;"Oh, is it called Miso Horny?"
02:02:06;02:02:08;"But Miso Horny was already..."
02:02:08;02:02:09;"That's not 2 Live Crew."
02:02:09;02:02:10;"""Ah, Miso..."""
02:02:10;02:02:11;"Like that song?"
02:02:11;02:02:12;"Yeah, that's 2 Live Crew."
02:02:12;02:02:13;"That's 2 Live Crew."
02:02:13;02:02:14;"Oh, that is."
02:02:14;02:02:16;"Is that sample from something else?"
02:02:16;02:02:19;"Yeah, it's from Platoon."
02:02:19;02:02:20;"Apocalypse Now."
02:02:21;02:02:22;"Oh, it's not from a song."
02:02:22;02:02:23;"It's from..."
02:02:23;02:02:24;"Oh, okay."
02:02:24;02:02:26;"I do remember being in a middle school dance"
02:02:26;02:02:29;"and my friend John's dad picked us up"
02:02:29;02:02:32;"and his dad was a Vietnam vet dude."
02:02:32;02:02:34;"[Laughs]"
02:02:34;02:02:35;"And it was like..."
02:02:35;02:02:38;"Maybe he was very versed in Apocalypse Now."
02:02:38;02:02:40;"Is that what that sample comes from?"
02:02:40;02:02:42;"It was actually Full Metal Jacket."
02:02:42;02:02:43;"Oh, Full Metal Jacket."
02:02:43;02:02:44;"Okay, perfect."
02:02:44;02:02:45;"Like a classic Vietnam movie."
02:02:45;02:02:47;"But I remember my dad's friend was a Vietnam vet"
02:02:47;02:02:49;"and was just sort of like..."
02:02:49;02:02:51;"He seemed to be thinking it was funny."
02:02:51;02:02:54;"He's like, ""Oh, Miso Horny? That's hilarious."""
02:02:54;02:02:56;"I remember just being tripped out"
02:02:56;02:02:58;"that he thought it was kind of funny."
02:02:58;02:03:02;"Also, I'm sure somebody's made this point before"
02:03:02;02:03:04;"probably many times,"
02:03:04;02:03:09;"but there is something uniquely buff and American"
02:03:09;02:03:14;"about this culture war about a song about being horny,"
02:03:14;02:03:19;"which 99.9% of human beings are to some degree."
02:03:19;02:03:21;"There's something so buff and American"
02:03:21;02:03:24;"about this crazy culture war about this song."
02:03:24;02:03:27;"Just picture that you were actually, for instance,"
02:03:27;02:03:30;"somebody who was a Vietnamese sex worker"
02:03:30;02:03:32;"or just anybody who lived in Vietnam"
02:03:32;02:03:34;"during that insane time."
02:03:34;02:03:38;"And somebody said, ""Oh, there's a big hit in America."
02:03:38;02:03:40;"It's causing a bit of a firestorm."""
02:03:40;02:03:41;"You're like, ""What song is it?"""
02:03:41;02:03:43;"They're like, ""Well, it samples an actress"
02:03:43;02:03:47;"saying 'Miso Horny' in a movie about Vietnam"
02:03:47;02:03:48;"during the war."
02:03:48;02:03:50;"It's about American soldiers during the war."""
02:03:50;02:03:52;"And they sampled that, and then the whole song"
02:03:52;02:03:54;"is about how this dude from Florida is really horny."
02:03:54;02:03:56;"But some of these old conservatives don't..."
02:03:56;02:03:59;"The whole thing is so insane when you put it that way."
02:03:59;02:04:01;"Oh, my God."
02:04:01;02:04:02;"Yeah."
02:04:02;02:04:03;"Pretty buff."
02:04:03;02:04:05;"I kind of want to revisit..."
02:04:05;02:04:07;"Okay, movie challenge for next episode."
02:04:07;02:04:11;"- Real metal jacket and full metal jacket. - Full metal jacket."
02:04:11;02:04:15;"I want to read up more about the culture wars around WAP."
02:04:15;02:04:17;"But I guess to summarize,"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"I basically like everything Cardi B does."
02:04:19;02:04:22;"So I think it's a fun video, and I like the song."
02:04:22;02:04:24;"But there's just something about"
02:04:24;02:04:26;"the culture war element of this song."
02:04:26;02:04:30;"It really feels like people are just role-playing now"
02:04:30;02:04:33;"It really does feel like a Xerox of..."
02:04:33;02:04:35;"It's just like nobody's heart is in it."
02:04:35;02:04:37;"You know what I mean?"
02:04:37;02:04:38;"Yeah."
02:04:38;02:04:41;"It's like this guy in his 30s"
02:04:41;02:04:43;"who's a conservative commentator"
02:04:43;02:04:44;"actually upset about it."
02:04:44;02:04:45;"Come on."
02:04:45;02:04:47;"- Hell no. - And also, is the song actually..."
02:04:47;02:04:49;"I got to tread carefully,"
02:04:49;02:04:50;"because I don't want to take anything away"
02:04:50;02:04:52;"from the artistry of the people who made it."
02:04:52;02:04:54;"There's funny lines, there's smart lines."
02:04:54;02:04:55;"It's a good song."
02:04:55;02:04:56;"But it's like..."
02:04:56;02:04:59;"I feel like the song doesn't particularly"
02:04:59;02:05:01;"have a provocative spirit in it."
02:05:01;02:05:03;"And the reactions, acting provoked,"
02:05:03;02:05:05;"it all just feels like some weird..."
02:05:05;02:05:08;"Yeah, you're supposed to react this way or that way."
02:05:08;02:05:09;"Yeah, at least in the..."
02:05:09;02:05:11;"These other songs you're talking about,"
02:05:11;02:05:12;"it really did seem like some"
02:05:12;02:05:14;"clash of civilization sh*t."
02:05:14;02:05:16;"Whereas this seems people who are very much"
02:05:16;02:05:18;"a part of the same civilization"
02:05:18;02:05:19;"play acting."
02:05:19;02:05:21;"But obviously, if you got to take sides,"
02:05:21;02:05:22;"you got to go with Cardi B."
02:05:22;02:05:23;"Come on."
02:05:23;02:05:24;"She's way cooler."
02:05:24;02:05:27;"I'm going to say something controversial on this show."
02:05:27;02:05:29;"Cardi B is cooler than Ben Shapiro."
02:05:29;02:05:33;"I don't care if conservatives want to"
02:05:33;02:05:34;"boycott Time Crisis."
02:05:34;02:05:35;"I won't back down."
02:05:35;02:05:37;"I think Cardi B is significantly cooler"
02:05:37;02:05:39;"than Mr. Shapiro."
02:05:39;02:05:42;"Anyway, congratulations to everybody"
02:05:42;02:05:45;"who made the top five in 2020 and 1994."
02:05:45;02:05:46;"That's going to be a new thing I do."
02:05:46;02:05:49;"I want to congratulate people for making the top five."
02:05:49;02:05:51;"Alright, guys. Great catch."
02:05:51;02:05:52;"Congrats to John Mellencamp."
02:05:52;02:05:54;"See you in two weeks. Peace."
