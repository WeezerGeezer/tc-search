00:02;00:09;"Time Crisis, here once again. Jake and I return to the studio to reflect"
00:09;00:16;"on our weekend in Ojai, our legendary weekend. We also talked to Dear Nora's Katie Davidson"
00:16;00:25;"about their new album and when they first met Jake in college in Portland. This is kind of"
00:25;00:35;"a different tone for the intro but anyway this is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. Beats one."
00:37;01:04;"Time Crisis back once again. Back from Ojai. I guess we should talk about the Ojai shows a"
01:04;01:09;"little bit. Yeah. At this point they were two weeks ago but hell of a weekend. It was a great"
01:09;01:14;"weekend. For people who don't know Richard Pictures, Jake's Grateful Dead cover band and"
01:14;01:19;"Vampire Weekend played two shows together. That was kind of the Vampire Weekend's kickoff after"
01:19;01:24;"not having played live in a long time. Crowds were great and I gotta say I love playing during the"
01:24;01:29;"day because we played Saturday night and then Sunday morning. And the Saturday night show was"
01:29;01:36;"we played at 6 p.m. Yeah so it's more of like a late afternoon show. Late afternoon in a morning"
01:36;01:42;"show. Yeah Sunday morning we had to be there at 8 30 a.m. for sound check. That was a first. That's"
01:42;01:48;"brutal. Did you make it at 8 30? I was there at 8 15. Wow. Had a breakfast sandwich, cup of coffee,"
01:48;01:54;"I was ready to go. Yeah that was a great vibe just like it was a good backstage vibe there. Oh yeah."
01:54;01:58;"We had so many like friends and family around. Food was on point. Shout out to Beacon Coffee in"
01:58;02:04;"Ojai. They set up a little stand. I also love that just like on the Sunday show just sipping"
02:04;02:09;"a coffee in between songs. Oh yeah. Feeling good. Saturday night I was doing a little tequila between"
02:09;02:14;"songs. Yeah. Sunday morning doing some coffee. Doing some coffee. I definitely want to do more."
02:14;02:23;"I think that's the I want to do the Vampire Weekend patented weekend show concept. We play"
02:23;02:28;"Saturday night Sunday morning. That's strong. Tequila and coffee. We could we could we could"
02:28;02:36;"we'll get get a sponsorship from both. Tequila and coffee tour. Gotta finish the album now."
02:36;02:40;"It may be a little bit off in the future but we'll definitely do it. What are you like half"
02:40;02:46;"done with the album? About I just I just feel like I need to write a few more songs. I think"
02:46;02:52;"I might go to down to Mexico for a couple weeks get some inspo. So we're looking like a mid 2020"
02:52;03:00;"release on that record. Yeah definitely the next president. Trump's second term. Oh god no we got"
03:00;03:06;"hope. Um no it's very close to being done but finishing records is truly one of my least"
03:06;03:12;"favorite things to do. What is it so many details and like second guessing like what's the? Well"
03:12;03:16;"it's kind of like I think the things that I do well or the things that I like to do that I care"
03:16;03:24;"about a lot of like songwriting arrangement conceptual things. Right. Singing. I like the"
03:24;03:29;"micro details of songwriting and I like the big picture details of production and arrangement."
03:29;03:35;"You know I love to be working with a producer and be kind of like no we should rethink this the song"
03:35;03:38;"should be tight and dry and the drum should be like this. What I don't like is getting really"
03:38;03:42;"into the weeds which is what you have to do at the end. And this is what I'm listening to like"
03:42;03:47;"literally sometimes I mean RL bust my balls because we literally have songs where because"
03:47;03:52;"you know you have to save the a new version every time you restart Pro Tools. Oh wow. Well you know"
03:52;03:56;"just to for you just to be diligent because what if you needed to go back to a version. Right so"
03:56;04:03;"save as. There's songs where I think there's like 150 to 200 versions. That's insane. How do you"
04:03;04:07;"even like. Well you know. Parse that out. You hope you don't have to go back to it but that's why"
04:07;04:13;"it's a lot of data. So you're just chewing through hard drives. Oh yeah man terabytes. Good lord."
04:13;04:20;"Like mining Bitcoin over there. Basically. Cooking the earth. God we probably should have."
04:20;04:26;"Back where back I used to front lock and go out mechanics bug anchorage and Dar es Salaam."
04:26;04:34;"Well only New York with champagne and disco. Take some M&A slash San Francisco. But actually Oakland"
04:34;04:40;"and Alameda. Your girl was in Berkeley with a communist reader. Mine was in town with a boombox"
04:40;04:47;"and Walkman. I was a horrible girl that was back then. But yeah you have to do all this stuff at"
04:47;04:53;"this point where and I've always hated this on every album where you know the song is good. You"
04:53;04:57;"know the arrangements good. You know that the conceptual production is good. But now I'm"
04:57;05:01;"listening to it I'm just like wait are people going to know it. Did the vocal get too quiet"
05:01;05:06;"there. People can be weirded out. Or does that sit well. Does it get a little harsh. Get a little"
05:06;05:11;"too mid rangy like those kind of real micro details which. And then you're so in and you"
05:11;05:15;"take a step back. But yeah. So now I have this real strong feeling when we were driving back"
05:15;05:22;"from Ohio and it was a really fun weekend like the shows were great. Great crew of people. We"
05:22;05:28;"had after party on Saturday night. We had a barbecue with great tacos. That was huge. On Sunday people"
05:28;05:35;"flew in from New York. It was just amazing. Then Monday ripping back to L.A. Rashid and Despot in"
05:35;05:40;"the car talking about life. I was just kind of looking out the window and I was like I really"
05:40;05:48;"have this sense of accomplishment where I was like man we really did it. We crushed Ohio. We"
05:48;05:55;"crushed Ohio for the weekend. And then I started to realize that my work had barely even begun."
05:55;05:58;"I had this sense of exhaustion from working on the album so long. And even you know it was like"
05:58;06:07;"a fun weekend. But like on Sunday I ate a lot of tacos. And I ate a Choco Taco for dessert too."
06:07;06:14;"And I was throwing down spicy margs at the barbecue. And then I stayed in the hot tub too long."
06:14;06:24;"I was cooked. You crashed out hard at like 645. Yeah when I got out of the hot tub I felt"
06:24;06:29;"incredibly nauseous. I really could like visualize the spicy marg and the Choco Taco and the real"
06:29;06:36;"tacos. Oh and the real quesadillas just getting like boiled in my stomach. Yeah so whatever."
06:36;06:41;"I'm basically I'm trying to say we worked hard. We played hard. It was a big weekend. And then"
06:41;06:45;"I'm driving back and I had this real sense of like that's all it should be. You know it's like when"
06:45;06:50;"you're a kid and you're in a school play. They rehearse for like four months. Then they do two"
06:50;06:57;"performances. And it's like really just like you know or maybe they do three. Yeah. A Sunday matinee."
06:57;07:02;"But you know like it's like this giant thing that the kids do. Working their asses off like learning"
07:02;07:08;"their lines and like holy this is such a big deal. Then you perform it three times by Sunday evening."
07:08;07:12;"Parents are there. Yeah parents are there. Everybody comes out. The community comes out."
07:12;07:18;"Saturday. Sunday night you crush some Coca-Cola from a plastic two liter and some pizza. Pasta"
07:18;07:23;"dinner. Maybe a pasta dinner. And you're like wow we really did this. And you're like but it's only"
07:23;07:27;"one weekend. And I don't know I felt like that a little bit. Like that'd be hilarious. It's just"
07:27;07:33;"like you work on an album for years and it's all building up to one weekend of shows. Two shows in"
07:33;07:38;"Ojai. Just two shows in Ojai. Tequila and coffee. I almost had this feeling and it was like funny"
07:38;07:43;"because we didn't really even play any new stuff. So it's not like we even presented any of the new"
07:43;07:48;"music to the fans. But I did have this feeling of just like kind of rolling back to L.A. just kind"
07:48;07:53;"of like had that feeling like yeah you know maybe I'll just take a few days off to chill and start"
07:53;08:00;"thinking about the next record."
08:01;08:11;"What's Texas bound? We stopped over in Santa Fe. That day in the pool. Just about halfway."
08:11;08:15;"Hey you know it was the hottest part of the day."
08:15;08:26;"And I took the horse up to the stall. Went to the bar room. Ordered drinks for all."
08:27;08:34;"Three days in the saddle. You know my body hurt. It'd been summer. I took off my shirt."
08:34;08:38;"And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt."
08:38;08:49;"Went to Texas Cowboys. There's all around. We were liquor and money. They loaded down."
08:50;08:58;"So soon after payday. No it seemed a shame. He starts playing the game."
09:20;09:23;"How was Santa Ana? Oh yeah then I forgot that we were playing Santa Ana."
09:23;09:29;"We played the two shows at the observatory in Santa Ana. What's that? Like is that a"
09:29;09:35;"rock club or what is it? Yeah it's a it's an 1100 cap rock club. Great sight lines."
09:35;09:40;"What does that mean exactly? It's not like some weird old theater where everybody is just like"
09:40;09:46;"standing in in a row. This place I don't know how long this has been open like five years. This place"
09:46;09:52;"was clearly designed for fan enjoyment. So it's kind of like a wide club and there's tiers. Oh"
09:52;09:56;"cool. So there's kind of not a bad place to stand in the house. I mean it's not like I've ever seen"
09:56;10:00;"a show there but my impression was there wasn't a bad place to stand in the house. It was definitely"
10:00;10:04;"different energy than the Ohio shows. I think I talked about it on stage a little bit because"
10:04;10:10;"Ohio was like crunchy hippy dippy father's day weekend. A lot of t-shirt sales going off the"
10:10;10:15;"chain. Oh yeah the t-shirt sales in Ohio were just unbelievable. Your guys shirts blew out. Oh yeah"
10:15;10:20;"sold them out first day. The father yeah first day. I had people just irate with me on the internet."
10:20;10:27;"Really? Just like do not post t-shirts online that you will not be selling on the internet. Oh and"
10:27;10:31;"I was like I got nothing for that. Guys it's 2018 there's gonna be a lot of interplay between the"
10:31;10:36;"internet and IRL. Yep. That's just how it is. Yeah and then the vampire weekend father's day shirts"
10:36;10:43;"blew out. Shout out to uh bring out your dead. Oh yeah. His shirts blew out very soft too. Yeah I"
10:43;10:49;"got in trouble with even some uh people close to me in my life because everybody was like yo can I"
10:49;10:53;"get some of those shirts and I was like yeah and I was like you know what on Sunday I'll grab some"
10:53;10:57;"then I get there on Sunday and I'm like yo can I get like five of these all gone. Yeah. I'm gonna"
10:57;11:02;"do a little reprint. It gets stressful with the shirts because it's limited run people are just"
11:02;11:07;"like right like I need one. Like yeah well but hey it's a good problem to have. Yeah. It's better"
11:07;11:14;"than the stress of uh ripping back down to LA with 200 unsold vampire weekend Richard pictures"
11:14;11:20;"June 16th 17th 2018 Ohio shirts. Taking up all sorts of room in the garage."
11:20;11:28;"Smash got like two years from now. Although are these the shirts from that Ohio weekend still here?"
11:28;11:34;"Oh man. I think we're gonna start doing shirts for every show. Oh I love it. Like we're playing"
11:34;11:39;"August 9th at the Old Town Pub. SoCal people mark your calendars. It's the anniversary of"
11:39;11:45;"Jerry Garcia's death. Oh yeah. So we're playing a big two set night there August 9th but we're"
11:45;11:50;"gonna do shirts for that. Oh sick. Yeah we did we did a special Santa Ana shirt too. Oh really?"
11:50;11:55;"I don't know if it blew out though. That's a deep shirt. We just did another long sleeve but anyway"
11:55;12:01;"yeah the observatory is a great club in Santa Ana. Um I think I've said things to this effect"
12:01;12:06;"on the show before but sometimes people think like you know when we post certain things on"
12:06;12:11;"Instagram we're being cryptic or mysterious or yeah or even like with the shows that there's"
12:11;12:15;"like you know sometimes there's no rhyme or reason it's just like somebody asked me a month ago hey"
12:15;12:20;"after the Ohio shows you want to do a couple more get everybody like continue to play yeah and you"
12:20;12:23;"know of course in my head a month ago I'm like yeah maybe even by then we'll be dropping new"
12:23;12:27;"songs in the set but whatever people seem chill but anyway yeah the energy was super different"
12:27;12:34;"because I don't know if it's like part of Orange County culture but people there like bring real"
12:34;12:38;"enthusiasm because you know like a lot of times people will generalize and say like well LA New"
12:38;12:44;"York shows the crowd's a little more arms crossed yeah not that psyched but then you know if you go"
12:44;12:49;"play show in Jersey or Orange County or just you know a little bit away from the big city"
12:49;12:54;"right people know how to have a good time and I kind of forgot that like there was significant"
12:54;12:59;"amounts of crowd surfing in Santa Ana sick which of course like you know Sunday morning in Ohio"
12:59;13:06;"you're not gonna get any of that especially after the a dead cover band opens it up in a real chill"
13:06;13:12;"way yeah that was chill vibes this was a little more intense a lot of like really loud singing"
13:12;13:17;"which was cool like people shouting the songs at the top of their lungs yeah nice yeah and just"
13:17;13:24;"really have some moshing moshing yeah to what songs cousin um there was like sometimes there'd"
13:24;13:30;"be like a light mosh to a not very moshy type song but yeah definitely the higher energy ones"
13:30;13:34;"you would see like real movement dude the pit during white sky yeah there was like yeah there"
13:34;13:39;"was a little bit like that have you had pits before yeah it was it made me think back because"
13:39;13:45;"maybe also because like I've been haven't done it in years and you know I'm older so I'm just more"
13:45;13:50;"chill now I then I kind of remembered I was like oh yeah in certain places we used to play it was"
13:50;13:56;"like straight up crazy pits wow I remember the UK that would happen a lot because they get down there"
13:56;14:03;"over there no but I remember one time it was like there was like a pit during horchata or some like"
14:03;14:09;"song that wasn't like one of the punky ones people just want to rage yeah but I respect that it's"
14:09;14:12;"tight yeah well then you always get a little stressed out because you know you're watching"
14:12;14:17;"the whole thing unfold in a way that the audience can't see yeah so and there was like some very"
14:17;14:23;"athletic crowd surfing there's like this uh dude and uh the second Santana show who wasn't even"
14:23;14:28;"just crowd surfing at a certain point his bros were like holding up his feet and legs and he was"
14:28;14:34;"crowd standing you know what I mean wow almost like some uh cheerleading but then there's also"
14:34;14:38;"just like you know sometimes you see like a big dude crowd surfing and the whole especially there"
14:38;14:44;"the whole club can see it so you're kind of like hell yeah you shout him out but then you look and"
14:44;14:48;"you're like you know see his like foot just missed somebody's head and you're just like imagining"
14:48;14:55;"some scenario where you're like oh hell yeah check it out crowd surfing bro and the next thing you"
14:55;14:59;"know like some you know smaller person is being like carried out by the bouncer everybody's like"
14:59;15:04;"dead quiet I'm just like I'm sorry I wasn't encouraging it I was just you know trying to"
15:04;15:10;"shout out I like the enthusiasm but yeah ratcheting it down a couple notches guys"
17:28;17:34;"all right well this is a hell of a show now that we're all caught up we got your original college"
17:34;17:41;"buddy katie davidson yep who I also know calling in calling in talk about the new dear nora album"

17:54;17:59;"iHob and things like that okay that was a major event man I saw someone tweeted at you that the"
17:59;18:05;"data seems to imply that they did not get more foot traffic right iHob that was gratifying the"
18:05;18:10;"thing that I don't like about it though is like you know everybody's gonna gang up on iHob but"
18:10;18:14;"they're gonna let all these other suckers get a pass you know what I mean everybody likes to see"
18:14;18:19;"a loser but sometimes you got to look around and be like you know what you're all losers all you"
18:19;18:24;"fast food social media places and by the way I haven't forgotten about Punisher Burgers"
18:24;18:28;"been accused I thought you just creeping into Punisher Burger character I'm still thinking"
18:28;18:34;"about it I still want to do it Frank Castle I make my own burgers and I do my own social media"
18:34;18:41;"I I still like that idea this is one TC idea that's not going to get lost in the sands of"
18:41;18:46;"time but anyway we'll get into all that later let's get Katie on the phone now let's go into"

20:26;20:36;"here's my recollection I lived one floor below Katie and we started playing music together pretty"
20:36;20:41;"shortly after meeting I would say within like a month or two and I remember our first like real"
20:41;20:47;"friend road trip was to Eugene Oregon and I want to say October November 95 to see Pavement play"
20:47;20:54;"yeah wowie zowie tour oh wow that's some classic that's some classic college stuff is like trying"
20:54;20:58;"to figure out who your friends are totally like you guys known each other for a month and just"
20:58;21:04;"being like uh you want to see pavement and Eugene yeah yeah figuring out that we like the same band"
21:04;21:11;"it's important well Lewis and Clark at that time though was a real hippie school yeah I think it's"
21:11;21:18;"a little more hip now but totally back then it was like hardcore hacky sack campus dogs"
21:20;21:26;"fish right fish was like the predominant aesthetic and so if you kind of sniffed out someone else"
21:26;21:32;"that was into like other you know whatever pavement that kind of stuff that was a big deal"
21:32;21:38;"is that fair yeah totally fair um I got one more addition to to your story I mean there's I'm sure"
21:38;21:45;"there's more but so I was roomed with our friend Mariana Richie and we used to we were kind of"
21:45;21:51;"becoming friends quickly as well and we would we were in I can't remember if we were in the same"
21:51;21:56;"Spanish class together or something whatever the point is I had my acoustic guitar with me"
21:56;22:03;"she had her banjo with her and we used to just make up songs in our dorm room and um sing so"
22:03;22:09;"loud and just sing in harmony and sing these songs in Spanish I remember this yeah and so I remember"
22:09;22:16;"that one of our connections was that you were into the music that you could hear coming out of our"
22:16;22:23;"I loved it Jake just yeah walking down the hallway just do like a quick knock on the door"
22:23;22:30;"just like yeah hey sounds pretty good sounds pretty good my name is Jake Longstreet I'm a"
22:30;22:37;"freshman from Connecticut so formal oh I know yeah oh god that reminds me I don't know if I"
22:37;22:42;"ever told this story on time crisis but I remember the first week of me being at college and I didn't"
22:42;22:50;"know anybody and I was pretty like a little tiny bit panicked because I'd gone to some like"
22:50;22:55;"students weekend at Brown when I was a senior in high school and the guy who was hosting me"
22:55;23:01;"was kind of like not that into his experience at Brown so far and I just remember you know trying"
23:01;23:05;"to do whatever you're in these weird situations where you're kind of like I guess I'm supposed"
23:05;23:10;"to ask questions I was like um do you have any advice for incoming freshmen and the guy and the"
23:10;23:16;"guy got dead-ass serious and said my advice make sure you make friends in the first week I messed"
23:16;23:23;"up man I didn't lock it down first semester and by spring semester I was floundering it's not fun"
23:23;23:28;"and I was like oh my god oh my god so anyway I took that with me so my my friend my first week"
23:29;23:37;"in college I do remember actually walking down a hallway and hearing some dude blasting um"
23:37;23:43;"kid a by Radiohead and then I was like every fiber in my being did not want to do it but"
23:43;23:49;"I like another voice in my head was just like this is how it gets done in adulthood and I just kind"

24:39;24:42;"- Time Crisis."
24:42;24:44;"- Yeah, and then we started playing music"
24:44;24:45;"and started a few bands."
24:45;24:46;"- Yep."
24:46;24:48;"- And then what year did Dear Nora start, '97?"
24:48;24:50;"- No dude, it wasn't until after,"
24:50;24:54;"it was like pretty much right after we graduated."
24:54;24:56;"I think senior year,"
24:56;24:59;"Richie and I just started recording all those songs"
24:59;25:01;"in the Lewis and Clark basement."
25:01;25:01;"- Right."
25:01;25:04;"- Like the music rooms and the drum rooms."
25:04;25:05;"- Mm-hmm."
25:05;25:07;"- And then those would go on to be called"
25:07;25:09;"Dear Nora recordings, but we didn't,"
25:09;25:13;"like I think we started playing Dear Nora live shows."
25:13;25:15;"I'm pretty sure, I wanna say fall, wait,"
25:15;25:16;"when did we graduate?"
25:16;25:19;"Yeah, fall '99, so it was the fall after we graduated."
25:19;25:20;"- Oh wow, okay."
25:20;25:21;"- Yeah."
25:21;25:23;"- But some of those songs were already iconic"
25:23;25:27;"in my imagination and in our friend group."
25:27;25:29;"- Right, a couple of the songs had been around."
25:29;25:30;"- You knew the early stuff."
25:30;25:32;"Oh wow, so you guys started in '99."
25:32;25:34;"- That means Dear Nora spans three decades."
25:34;25:35;"- Oh my God, it's true."
25:35;25:37;"- It's always funny when people put it like,"
25:37;25:39;"it's like clearly not even 20 years yet,"
25:39;25:43;"but just 'cause you edged out, spanning three decades."
25:43;25:45;"The '90s, the aughts and the teens."
25:45;25:46;"- Dear Nora."
25:46;25:48;"- Yeah."
25:48;25:50;"Well, it's funny that you bring that up"
25:50;25:54;"because I now privy to the fact that I have these fans"
25:54;25:56;"that are very much younger than me"
25:56;26:00;"and they make an assumption, which I think,"
26:00;26:01;"like I understand where it comes from,"
26:01;26:06;"but they like talk to me about what the '90s were like"
26:06;26:07;"and I'm like, yeah, I mean,"
26:07;26:10;"most of what Dear Nora did wasn't in the '90s."
26:10;26:12;"Of course, we were like, lived the '90s,"
26:12;26:14;"we remember it, we went to pavement shows in the '90s,"
26:14;26:15;"but like, I don't know."
26:15;26:18;"I wasn't really like part of like that mid '90s,"
26:18;26:21;"early '90s Riot Grrrl scene or anything."
26:21;26:22;"- Right, just by virtue of the fact"
26:22;26:24;"that the band started in the '90s,"
26:24;26:26;"it just kind of drags you into a decade"
26:26;26:29;"that you were only performing live in for a few months of."
26:29;26:32;"- Yeah, I think they picture me being more,"
26:32;26:35;"even more of an elder than I already am."
26:35;26:36;"- I was just asking Jake,"
26:36;26:39;"'cause I hoped it wasn't derogatory"
26:39;26:40;"'cause some people have mixed feelings about it,"
26:40;26:43;"but is it fair to describe Dear Nora as indie?"
26:43;26:46;"Because over those three decades,"
26:46;26:48;"the word has changed quite a bit, you know,"
26:48;26:50;"in the way how people describe music,"
26:50;26:51;"how people feel about it."
26:51;26:55;"Back in '99, would you guys have called yourself an indie band"
26:55;26:59;"or was there even any reason to describe yourselves?"
26:59;27:03;"- I guess gut reaction is like what I associate"
27:03;27:05;"with that term and the way it's used is like"
27:05;27:10;"independent label, which is what we were clearly on."
27:10;27:13;"When people called us indie pop, I was like,"
27:13;27:15;"I don't know what that is, but all right, fine."
27:15;27:16;"- I'm sure it was just like the same"
27:16;27:18;"when like people started telling the guys"
27:18;27:21;"in Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains that they were grunge."
27:21;27:22;"- Yeah, exactly. - And they were like,"
27:22;27:25;"okay, if you say so. - Right."
27:25;27:26;"- I don't remember us ever being like,"
27:26;27:28;"oh yeah, we're an indie rock band."
27:28;27:31;"- No, that just wasn't even really on my radar."
27:31;27:35;"I like, I came to college from rural Arizona."
27:35;27:39;"I listened to whatever quote unquote college rock"
27:39;27:42;"or you know, some of the bigger independent labels"
27:42;27:44;"if they were even called that back then."
27:44;27:47;"But yeah, I just like, mostly we were just trying"
27:47;27:51;"to like play songs like Pavement and Weezer and stuff."
27:51;27:54;"- Ezra referred to your band before we called you as a,"
27:54;27:57;"was it seminal indie band or what was the term you used?"
27:57;28:00;"- Renown? - Seminal, Renown, classic."
28:00;28:02;"Something of that nature."

29:09;29:10;"- Yeah."
29:10;29:13;"- Like definitely the work has cast a long shadow."
29:13;29:17;"- Yeah, I mean, it kind of came as a surprise to me."
29:17;29:19;"I mean, I started moving on to other things in my life."
29:19;29:22;"I was still writing songs, but I guess it's just sort of"
29:22;29:27;"as streaming platforms became more commonplace,"
29:27;29:29;"more people started hearing it and not just hearing"
29:29;29:31;"like one or two songs on YouTube or whatever,"
29:31;29:33;"but like going hella deep."
29:33;29:39;"And like just knowing like obscure, weird shit"

29:50;29:51;"everybody has access to everything."
29:51;29:54;"People will be kind of rediscovering bands"
29:54;29:56;"on independent labels from that era."
29:56;29:57;"You just don't hear too many stories."
29:57;30:00;"There's something like, I think pretty like unique about it."
30:00;30:02;"- Cream rises to the top."
30:02;30:03;"- That's right."
30:03;30:04;"- I mean, it's totally true."
30:04;30:06;"Like I said, I was totally surprised."
30:06;30:11;"I mean, I heard via our friend who I mentioned, Richie,"
30:11;30:13;"via Michael Azarad."
30:13;30:15;"Michael Azarad emailed Richie and was like,"
30:15;30:20;"""Hey, there's a band that has a song called Dear Nora."""
30:20;30:22;"That, and he's like, ""They're really good."
30:22;30:23;"You should check them out."""
30:23;30:24;"And it was Girlpool."
30:24;30:25;"And I was like, ""What?"""
30:25;30:27;"I was like, ""What?"""
30:27;30:29;"So, you know, just like, just hearing that shit."
30:29;30:31;"- Let me talk to my lawyer."
30:31;30:33;"(laughing)"
30:33;30:35;"Cease and desist."
30:35;30:38;"First I was irate, but then once I calmed down,"
30:38;30:40;"I thought, okay, that's pretty cool."
30:40;30:43;"Their song, Dear Nora, is a truly loving tribute"
30:43;30:46;"to the aesthetic of those early records."
30:46;30:47;"- I love that song."
30:47;30:50;"It sounds like mountain rock or something to me."
30:50;30:51;"- It's a beautiful song."
30:51;30:52;"- It really is."
30:52;30:54;"- Yeah, and to like take it a step further,"
30:54;30:57;"when I finally met those two, who I absolutely adore,"
30:57;31:00;"they're incredible, I got to see them play live"
31:00;31:03;"and I got like fully choked up at their show"
31:03;31:08;"because I clearly, they have many quote unquote influences."
31:08;31:10;"Like, of course it's not me."
31:10;31:12;"It's like, there's a lot of other people too,"
31:12;31:16;"but something about just hearing them play stripped down"
31:16;31:20;"with like bass and guitar and just two vocals in harmony,"
31:20;31:22;"I was like, damn, this is amazing."
31:22;31:26;"Like, even if we only contributed a small amount"
31:26;31:28;"to what they're doing, like, this is so tight."
31:28;31:30;"I feel inspired."
31:30;31:33;"- Yeah, I saw them at the Echo a year or two ago"
31:33;31:34;"and I loved it."
31:34;31:35;"- Yeah, rad."
31:35;31:39;"- It really did bring me back to that dorm room, fall '95."

33:11;33:14;"from using the Dear Nora name."
33:14;33:16;"You were still making music, writing songs,"
33:16;33:18;"releasing music in that time."
33:18;33:22;"What was the impetus to bring back the OG vehicle?"
33:22;33:25;"- I think that I just had enough separation from it."
33:25;33:26;"You know, I don't know."
33:26;33:29;"I just like, towards the end of my 20s, early 30s,"
33:29;33:32;"I was like, okay, that's clearly a project"
33:32;33:33;"that belongs in my 20s."
33:33;33:37;"It's like, I'm not finding the things I used to find fun"
33:37;33:39;"quite as fun anymore."
33:39;33:40;"Feels more like a struggle,"
33:40;33:43;"like some of that dumb, am I supposed to be turning"
33:43;33:45;"into an adult kind of bullshit comes up."
33:45;33:46;"And so I just was like,"
33:46;33:48;"let's just leave that band name behind."
33:48;33:51;"Let's leave it with the like terrible 20s."
33:51;33:53;"I think just enough time passed"
33:53;33:58;"where it didn't trigger like bad feelings in the gut anymore."
33:58;34:01;"It was more like I had enough separation"
34:01;34:07;"to not just like cringe at every single thing I recorded."
34:07;34:10;"I mean, I still cringe at 75% of it, but."
34:10;34:13;"- Yeah, I think that's just so many artists."
34:13;34:16;"Yeah, you need some perspective."
34:16;34:17;"- For sure."
34:17;34:18;"And the separation did me right."
34:18;34:21;"Like I took almost 10 years away from it."
34:21;34:23;"Like just that name for whatever that means,"
34:23;34:26;"like whatever the reason,"
34:26;34:27;"something about the name was like,"
34:27;34:28;"I just needed to take a break from it"
34:28;34:31;"and whatever that means to other people."
34:31;34:34;"But after a while, it was just a game of like,"
34:34;34:35;"fuck it, doesn't matter anymore."
34:35;34:37;"Like most people know that name."
34:37;34:39;"I'm gonna make new music."
34:39;34:41;"Let's just use that name."
34:41;34:44;"Especially because people were starting to use that name"
34:44;34:46;"and reference that name more often."
34:46;34:48;"I'm like, it doesn't matter anymore."
34:48;34:50;"You know, let's just like reach the most people."
34:50;34:54;"So yeah, definitely a lot of like separation"
34:54;34:57;"and like letting go to just get back into that name"

40:39;41:00;"- You know, in light of last week's conversation,"
41:00;41:01;"or last episode's conversation,"
41:01;41:03;"we were talking about how here on Time Crisis,"
41:03;41:07;"we're getting kind of fed up with the cutesy"
41:07;41:09;"social media personalities"
41:09;41:12;"of what should be faceless corporations."
41:12;41:13;"You know, maybe that's the problem,"
41:13;41:15;"is that for a long time,"
41:15;41:18;"people would always be rallying against faceless corporations"
41:18;41:22;"or destroying our democracy or taking away our freedom."
41:22;41:23;"And then of course, 'cause this is America,"
41:23;41:26;"rather than dismantle the faceless corporations,"
41:26;41:28;"they're kind of like, ""America, we heard you."
41:28;41:30;"""No more faceless corporations."
41:30;41:32;"""We're gonna put a face and a personality"
41:32;41:34;"""on every corporation."""
41:34;41:35;"- A little window dressing."
41:35;41:36;"- Yeah."
41:36;41:38;"Well, you can't call them faceless anymore."
41:38;41:41;"- They have an ironic personality now."
41:41;41:43;"- You certainly can't call them voiceless."
41:43;41:44;"I guess the thing is,"
41:44;41:49;"we all live with a lot of daily brutality in America."
41:49;41:52;"And that's why last episode we were talking about"
41:52;41:54;"this semi-fawning New York Times piece"
41:54;41:57;"about the whole IHOP marketing campaign."
41:57;42:00;"And they couldn't even report dispassionate."
42:00;42:01;"They had to kind of be like,"
42:01;42:03;"""Oh my God, it was a great marketing idea."""
42:03;42:06;"And they called it a success."
42:06;42:09;"And there wasn't even data to suggest it was a success yet."
42:09;42:10;"- And now that we have a little data"
42:10;42:12;"to suggest that it wasn't a success"
42:12;42:17;"in terms of getting butts in the restaurant spending money,"
42:17;42:21;"I feel like the Times owes us an apology and retraction."
42:21;42:23;"- Yo, we should write a letter to the New York Times"
42:23;42:24;"about like a three-week old article."
42:24;42:26;"- Oh, this would be strong."
42:26;42:27;"- We take issue."
42:27;42:28;"So it's--"
42:28;42:29;"- The June 2nd article."
42:29;42:31;"- It's one thing when there's just kind of like"
42:31;42:33;"some like annoying marketing shit"
42:33;42:34;"out there in the atmosphere."
42:34;42:36;"But what's really annoying is that when you see people"
42:36;42:38;"just like loving it."
42:38;42:42;"And I came across this article that annoyed me"
42:42;42:44;"and I had to share with the crisis crew."
42:44;42:46;"This is on a website called Board Panda."
42:46;42:47;"- I saw that and I was like,"
42:47;42:50;"how does Ezra end up on these websites?"
42:50;42:55;"- I ended up on Board Panda because I read an article"
42:55;42:59;"about a French photographer who did a book"
42:59;43:01;"about pagan costumes of Europe."
43:01;43:04;"And I'll show it to you because it's unbelievable."
43:04;43:06;"And I think Board Panda is like,"
43:06;43:09;"I don't know how legit of a site it is."
43:09;43:11;"Clearly on like some Buzzfeed type thing,"
43:11;43:13;"they're good at getting people to like stay on"
43:13;43:14;"and just keep clicking."
43:14;43:16;"I don't know how much original stuff they do,"
43:16;43:20;"how much editorial oversight there is over at Board Panda."
43:20;43:22;"But I saw this headline as I was looking"
43:22;43:24;"at the pagan costumes of Europe"
43:24;43:26;"and I couldn't resist a click."
43:26;43:27;"So they got me."
43:27;43:28;"- They got you."
43:28;43:29;"- This is the headline."
43:29;43:33;"Guy tells Walmart he likes to steal from their stores"
43:33;43:35;"and their response is so good,"
43:35;43:37;"people say they beat Wendy's."
43:37;43:38;"So everything about--"
43:38;43:39;"- That's Taylor made for us."
43:39;43:40;"- Yeah, and everything about that,"
43:40;43:42;"I was just already like so annoyed."
43:42;43:47;"This Board Panda, now the New York Times can buy into,"
43:47;43:49;"I was marketing campaign,"
43:49;43:51;"but I expect more from Board Panda."
43:51;43:55;"And it's so funny because it like kind of presupposes"
43:55;43:57;"that we live in a world where Wendy's already"
43:57;44:02;"is the gold standard for a savage social media account."
44:02;44:05;"And so literally the headline,"
44:05;44:07;"oh man, Walmart roasted a guy so good,"
44:07;44:11;"some people say they may even be as good as Wendy's,"
44:11;44:12;"if not better."
44:12;44:15;"And this is the opening sentence."
44:15;44:18;"We all know Wendy's is really savage on social media,"
44:18;44:20;"but it seems there's another company"
44:20;44:23;"that's equally badass calling Walmart badass."
44:23;44:25;"See, this is what these people dream about,"
44:25;44:29;"that by having Wendy's or Walmart"
44:29;44:31;"do something savage on social media,"
44:31;44:33;"that one day people will be like,"
44:33;44:36;"you know, say what you will about their labor practices,"
44:36;44:38;"Walmart's pretty badass."
44:38;44:39;"- They are funny."
44:39;44:41;"- They're funny."
44:41;44:42;"- Say what you will about what they do"
44:42;44:44;"to the economies of small towns."
44:44;44:46;"But they are funny."
44:46;44:49;"- And honestly, if you're gonna be real savage on Twitter,"
44:49;44:50;"you're gonna be a little bit savage"
44:50;44:53;"in business practices too, and that's okay."
44:53;44:53;"So anyway."
44:53;44:55;"- Whoa, heavy. - Walmart."
44:55;44:57;"Walmart is equally badass."
44:57;45:00;"Recently, Twitter user @merc361"
45:00;45:03;"challenged the retailer to a word fight on the internet,"
45:03;45:04;"and it didn't back down."
45:04;45:05;"Word fight."
45:05;45:07;"Not intimidated by an insult"
45:07;45:09;"that has been liked over 80K times,"
45:09;45:12;"Walmart answered to it in the best possible way."
45:12;45:15;"American multinational retail corporation one,"
45:15;45:17;"random internet user zero."
45:17;45:19;"That about sums it up."
45:19;45:20;"- This is, yeah."
45:20;45:23;"- Gigantic brutal corporation one,"
45:23;45:25;"human being zero."
45:25;45:26;"Savage."
45:26;45:27;"- Copy that."
45:27;45:30;"- Continue scrolling to read their hilarious exchange."
45:30;45:31;"Well, I'm just gonna read it."
45:31;45:33;"You guys don't have to scroll."
45:33;45:34;"Pretend you're scrolling at home."
45:34;45:35;"And there's like a big picture"
45:35;45:37;"of this random dude, merc361."
45:37;45:39;"- That sucks that his photo went out."
45:39;45:42;"- I guess he semi brought it upon himself."
45:42;45:44;"That's his user profile."
45:44;45:47;"And he wrote, ""I like going to Walmart for fun."""
45:47;45:47;"And then Walmart tweeted at him."
45:47;45:49;"- 7,000 likes on that."
45:49;45:54;"- Well, I think that's probably backdating on it."
45:54;45:55;"And then Walmart tweeted at him,"
45:55;45:56;"""It's the small things, merc."
45:56;45:58;"""What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"""
45:58;46:00;"First of all, they're already setting him up"
46:00;46:01;"to say some funny shit."
46:01;46:02;"- Yeah."
46:02;46:03;"- What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"
46:03;46:04;"So they set him up."
46:04;46:06;"I like going to Walmart for fun."
46:06;46:07;"And they tweeted him,"
46:07;46:09;"""What's your favorite thing to do in our stores?"""
46:09;46:11;"And then he writes back, ""Steal."""
46:11;46:14;"(explosion)"
46:14;46:15;"Which is fair."
46:15;46:16;"They set him up."
46:16;46:18;"They set him up for it."
46:18;46:20;"- 300,000 likes on that."
46:20;46:23;"- Got 81K people talking about it."
46:23;46:26;"- That's not getting one more customer in the store,"
46:26;46:26;"by the way."
46:26;46:27;"- No."
46:27;46:28;"- This is just all noise."
46:28;46:33;"- So he tweets that at 5.39 PM, June 20th, 2018."
46:33;46:36;"The next, in the middle of the night, 2.38 AM,"
46:36;46:38;"nine hours later,"
46:38;46:44;"under the cover of night,"
46:44;46:46;"Walmart gets back on the keyboard."
46:46;46:48;"They needed nine hours to think about"
46:48;46:49;"how to respond to that."
46:49;46:51;"- They had to consult with the higher ups."
46:51;46:52;"- Yeah."
46:52;46:53;"- I bet that's true."
46:53;46:54;"- Can you imagine those chains?"
46:54;46:55;"- Just like--"
46:55;46:56;"- We got an epic burn here,"
46:56;46:57;"but running up the flagpole,"
46:57;46:58;"make sure we get clearance on that."
46:58;47:00;"- Wait, was the family owns Walmart, the Waltons?"
47:00;47:01;"- Yeah."
47:01;47:03;"This could go all the way to Alice Walton."
47:03;47:05;"Alice is not available, dude."
47:05;47:06;"She's in Vail."
47:06;47:06;"She can't--"
47:06;47:09;"- The house manager is on the phone."
47:09;47:12;"""Ms. Walton's been asleep for three hours."""
47:12;47:14;"She specifically said that she did not want to be disturbed."
47:14;47:15;"- This is urgent."
47:15;47:16;"- This is urgent."
47:16;47:17;"Wake up, Mrs. Walton."
47:17;47:19;"She's like, ""Hello, what's the meaning of this?"""
47:21;47:24;"""Ms. Walton, this is the team down at Walmart social media."
47:24;47:27;"""We got burned pretty bad by a guy named Merc361."
47:27;47:33;"""How do we have permission to use lethally savage force?"""
47:33;47:35;"Like, ""And him."""
47:35;47:37;"(laughing)"
47:37;47:41;"I'm so curious about the nine hours in between."
47:41;47:44;"- The email chains, the frantic phone calls."
47:44;47:44;"- Yeah."
47:44;47:46;"No, because I'm sure that it was a big deal,"
47:46;47:48;"especially Walmart is supposedly family friendly"
47:48;47:49;"or something. - Right."
47:49;47:51;"- Kind of like middle America family friendly."
47:51;47:53;"So, they're like Wendy's."
47:53;47:54;"Wendy's has already established themselves."
47:54;47:55;"They're punk rock."
47:55;47:56;"- Right."
47:56;47:57;"- They tell people to go fuck themselves."
47:57;47:59;"But Walmart, they're probably right on the line."
47:59;48:01;"They're just like, ""Man, we've been burned pretty bad."""
48:01;48:04;"It's a little bit like the Drake Pusha T beef."
48:04;48:08;"Apparently, I heard that Drake had a comeback to Pusha T"
48:08;48:11;"that was so savage, it would have destroyed Kanye's career,"
48:11;48:14;"Pusha T's career, and long-term Drake's career."
48:14;48:15;"- What?"
48:15;48:17;"- A true nuclear option."
48:17;48:18;"- What?"
48:18;48:18;"- That's what people say."
48:18;48:20;"- It could possibly be."
48:20;48:21;"- I thought about it."
48:21;48:22;"I have my theories."
48:22;48:24;"I don't wanna get into it,"
48:24;48:26;"'cause that's none of my business."
48:26;48:28;"I'm just saying, if there was something so crazy"
48:28;48:31;"that he had on, and that apparently Kanye told Pusha T,"
48:31;48:34;"""You gotta end this,"" and then even Drake,"
48:34;48:40;"when he beheld the awesome power of his savage information,"
48:40;48:45;"similar to, what's the guy that worked on the atomic bomb?"
48:45;48:46;"- Oh, Oppenheimer?"
48:46;48:48;"- Oh, Oppenheimer."
48:48;48:48;"- Yeah, it's--"
48:48;48:49;"- Oppenheimer looked and said,"
48:49;48:53;"""Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."""
48:53;48:55;"Drake looked at the savage information,"
48:55;48:57;"which was basically an atomic bomb,"
48:57;49:00;"and he felt, he thought of that line,"
49:00;49:02;"""Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."""
49:02;49:04;"He's Thanos, basically, and he knew,"
49:04;49:09;"""If I use this information, yes, I will destroy the enemy,"
49:09;49:13;"""but I'll create a void so crazy"
49:13;49:16;"""that I will be sucked into it, too."""
49:16;49:19;"- Mutually assured destruction."
49:19;49:20;"- Yeah, it's the Cold War."
49:20;49:25;"- Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds."

50:25;50:26;"He says--"
50:26;50:28;"- He says that he likes to steal from Walmart."
50:28;50:30;"- That's his favorite thing to do."
50:30;50:31;"Nine hours go by."
50:31;50:32;"- Nine hours go by. - It's 2.40 in the morning."
50:32;50:34;"Alice Walton's on the horn."
50:34;50:37;"- She gives the go-ahead for them to go savage."
50:37;50:41;"- Guys, go savage. - They rode back."
50:41;50:43;"- Well played, Merc."
50:43;50:46;"After further review of our store's video feed,"
50:46;50:48;"we've decided to let you keep the rash cream."
50:48;50:51;"Next time though, pay in full."
50:51;50:53;"Winky face emoji."
50:53;50:55;"(explosion)"
50:55;50:57;"- Eat shit, Merc."
50:57;50:58;"- Yeah."
50:58;51:00;"(laughing)"
51:00;51:04;"So yeah, they're like, they're running all the numbers."
51:04;51:05;"What can we do here?"
51:05;51:06;"Do we tell them to go fuck himself?"
51:06;51:08;"Like no, take the high road."
51:08;51:11;"We're gonna say, yeah, okay, we know you stole,"
51:11;51:13;"but you stole rash cream."
51:13;51:15;"- Rash cream?"
51:15;51:17;"- You have a rash, Merc."
51:17;51:19;"- Yeah, I got poison ivy, big deal."
51:19;51:20;"So I got some cortisone cream."
51:20;51:22;"That's how he should've come back."
51:22;51:23;"- It's funny 'cause it's Walmart,"
51:23;51:26;"so they couldn't like, a more savage company"
51:26;51:29;"would've made it like an STD or something."
51:29;51:32;"- Or like, you got the ED medication, huh?"
51:32;51:34;"- Right, which would be very problematic,"
51:34;51:36;"but so this way--"
51:36;51:38;"- Or if they just go like way hard,"
51:38;51:40;"like very un-PC stuff."
51:40;51:41;"- Yeah."
51:41;51:45;"- Yeah, you got that box of gay pornos, huh?"
51:45;51:46;"- Right, just like--"
51:46;51:47;"- Wait, wait, we don't even carry that."
51:47;51:48;"- Yeah."
51:48;51:48;"(laughing)"
51:48;51:50;"- Just like."
51:50;51:51;"- You know there's at least some part of--"
51:51;51:52;"- What else?"
51:52;51:54;"- Just Walmart going full homophobic."
51:54;51:55;"I mean, I'm--"
51:55;51:56;"- Totally."
51:56;51:57;"- Actually, I'm curious, has that happened yet?"
51:57;51:58;"Just like--"
51:58;51:59;"- Oh, overstepping?"
51:59;52:01;"- Well yeah, like overstepping and just,"
52:01;52:04;"'cause obviously, we see people do that all the time."
52:04;52:05;"They think they're being funny,"
52:05;52:08;"and they say something awful, racist, or homophobic."
52:08;52:11;"I wonder if that's ever gonna happen with like a brand."
52:11;52:13;"- No, but the joke is that it's all Ivy League grads"
52:13;52:17;"running the social media accounts of these corporations."
52:17;52:19;"- They could still maybe do something by accident."
52:19;52:20;"- Right."
52:20;52:22;"- Wendy's did not know."
52:22;52:23;"- Well, hence the nine hours."
52:23;52:24;"They gotta lawyer up."
52:24;52:29;"- Right, is there anything racist about telling Merc 361"
52:29;52:30;"that he has a rash?"
52:30;52:31;"- Is it homophobic?"
52:31;52:34;"- Is it homophobic to tell Merc 361 that he has a rash?"
52:34;52:36;"- Is it Islamophobic?"
52:36;52:39;"- Is it Islamophobic to tell Merc 361 that he has a rash?"
52:39;52:41;"Yeah, just imagine like the conversations,"
52:41;52:44;"and like there's like 10 people on the Supreme Council"
52:44;52:47;"of Walmart, nine are in favor, and one's like,"
52:47;52:50;"""I don't know, guys, I think it's a little racist."""
52:50;52:52;"God, that would be, I would love just to see"
52:52;52:54;"one of these companies just like,"
52:54;52:56;"they deserve to get like real roasted."
52:56;52:57;"- Yeah."
52:57;52:57;"- 'Cause that's what the thing, all this,"
52:57;53:00;"it's like this like fun and games, fake personality stuff."
53:00;53:03;"Anyway, so Walmart took their nine hours,"
53:03;53:05;"and they came up with calling it rash cream."
53:06;53:09;"- People applauding Walmart for such a savage answer."
53:09;53:11;"- Yeah, to continue with the--"
53:11;53:12;"- Oh, there's like pages of this shit."
53:12;53:13;"- Yeah. - Wow."
53:13;53:17;"- So these are some of the tweets that people said."
53:17;53:19;"LMFAO, at least they have a sense of humor."
53:19;53:20;"Gotta love Walmart."
53:20;53:24;"When you take a step back, how did we get to this place"
53:24;53:27;"in our world where, say what you,"
53:27;53:29;"it literally is a human being saying,"
53:29;53:29;"""Say what you want about Walmart."""
53:29;53:30;"They got a sense of humor."
53:30;53:33;"Walmart is funnier than Merc 361."
53:33;53:34;"- You gotta love 'em."
53:34;53:35;"- Somebody else tweeted,"
53:35;53:37;"""Wow, Walmart is more savage than Wendy's."""
53:37;53:39;"And I didn't think that was even possible."
53:39;53:41;"Wendy's is the height of savagery."
53:41;53:43;"Some other ones,"
53:43;53:45;"""He's gonna have to steal some burn cream now."""
53:45;53:48;"Another person said, ""Should've said,"
53:48;53:52;"""we'll let you keep the extra small condoms, LMFAO."""
53:52;53:53;"- Okay, yep."
53:53;53:55;"- You know what, that's also funny too, how like--"
53:55;53:57;"- That's not an item that's sold."
53:57;53:58;"- Yeah."
53:58;54:00;"- Extra small condoms, I've looked."
54:00;54:01;"Okay."
54:01;54:06;"Also, it's funny too that Walmart is opening it up"
54:06;54:09;"for other people to roast this guy too."
54:09;54:10;"- Yeah."
54:10;54:14;"- Walmart's like, ""Oh, we just made a joke about a rash."
54:14;54:18;"""All that racist shit down in the bottom, that's on them."""
54:18;54:21;"I can't say I was sad to see it."
54:21;54:23;"Just like, at the end of the day,"
54:23;54:27;"Walmart is engaging in this larger conversation."
54:27;54:30;"- Oh, Walmart's social media manager bringing the heat."
54:30;54:33;"They should do a collab with Wendy's."
54:33;54:34;"- Oh, here's another one."
54:34;54:35;"""Holy shit, man, I love it when corporations"
54:35;54:38;"""take the shit in full and swing it back, it's hilarious."""
54:38;54:40;"- Woo!"
54:40;54:42;"- Anyway, just like the whole tone of this article,"
54:42;54:45;"just like, ""Boys, we didn't think anyone"
54:45;54:47;"""could be as savage as Wendy's, but now we got Walmart."""
54:47;54:49;"Whatever, I guess people feel that way."
54:49;54:51;"""I'd like to follow up with Merc361"
54:51;54:52;"""and see how he feels about the whole thing."""
54:52;54:54;"- We should have him call in."
54:54;54:56;"- Hey, can we get Merc361 on the horn?"
54:56;54:57;"Maybe next time."
54:57;55:00;"Just talking about this two months later."
55:00;55:04;"- Maybe Bored Panda's secretly owned by Walmart."
55:04;55:05;"- Oh, that'd be hilarious."
55:05;55:07;"- False flag Walmart operation."
55:07;55:10;"- It's possible that Walmart, also remember last time"
55:10;55:11;"we were looking at the YouTube comments"
55:11;55:13;"for the Hardee's commercial?"
55:13;55:13;"- Oh yeah."
55:13;55:15;"- And our friend was saying that she thought"
55:15;55:17;"that a bunch of the comments might have been"
55:17;55:20;"from people who worked for the brand."
55:20;55:23;"So it's also hilarious, too, to imagine that"
55:23;55:25;"Walmart has like a troll farm, basically,"
55:25;55:27;"that every time they tweet something,"
55:27;55:30;"they might have 100 accounts that they're also running,"
55:30;55:32;"people just being like, ""Holy shit, that's so savage."
55:32;55:33;"""Not only do you have great deals,"
55:33;55:35;"""you burned the shit out of that piece of shit."""
55:35;55:38;"- Or dude, maybe Merc was false flag."
55:38;55:39;"- Oh my God."
55:39;55:41;"- He was working for Walmart the whole time, dude."
55:41;55:42;"- Whoa."
55:42;55:44;"- That's some Alex Jones stuff right there."
55:44;55:46;"- They planned the whole narrative."
55:46;55:47;"- I've seen the documents."
55:47;55:50;"- Yeah, because that's true."
55:50;55:52;"If you really wanna win people over,"
55:52;55:54;"nobody likes just a big corporation"
55:54;55:56;"that's destroying local economies"
55:56;56:00;"and not giving people health insurance."
56:00;56:03;"People only like you when you've been on the ropes"
56:03;56:05;"once or twice."
56:05;56:07;"America loves a comeback story."
56:07;56:08;"- Yeah."
56:08;56:09;"- You know, it's like Donald Trump."
56:09;56:11;"- That's why he's gonna win in 2020."
56:11;56:12;"- Oh, no, don't say that."
56:12;56:14;"But it's like if people had really,"
56:14;56:15;"that's why I like a lot of--"
56:15;56:16;"- That's too dark."
56:16;56:17;"- A lot of lefties were pulling their hair out"
56:17;56:20;"just being kind of like, ""How do you not see"
56:20;56:24;"""that this dude is the epitome of what nobody likes?"
56:24;56:25;"""He's a rich guy."
56:25;56:27;"""He got a million dollars from his dad."
56:27;56:29;"""He pulls strings for himself."
56:29;56:30;"""He's the swamp."
56:30;56:31;"""How do people not see it?"""
56:31;56:34;"And it's because he crafted his little wrestling-esque"
56:34;56:37;"narrative about him being the Avenger"
56:37;56:38;"and, ""Man, I've had it bad too."
56:38;56:40;"""And oh my God, I look at these people"
56:40;56:41;"""and boy, I built my own thing."
56:41;56:43;"""I'm just like you."""
56:43;56:44;"People like somebody that they think"
56:44;56:46;"has been up and down a little bit."
56:46;56:48;"So Walmart is like, ""We need to drop some savagery"
56:48;56:50;"""on people, but we need to make it--"""
56:50;56:51;"- Right."
56:51;56:53;"- ""It needs to be, we need to be in the right."
56:53;56:55;"""We need a heroic moment."""
56:55;56:56;"- We need to be aggrieved."
56:56;56:59;"- ""Right, we were just trying to be sweet to Merc361."
56:59;57:00;"""Then he tells us he steals?"
57:00;57:02;"""Well, nobody likes a thief."""
57:02;57:03;"- Dude, that's my call."
57:03;57:05;"Inside job from the get."
57:05;57:07;"- Wow, savage."
57:07;57:09;"But there was a picture of Merc361."
57:09;57:10;"There's like a real thing."
57:10;57:13;"You see, they might've had to disappear the original guy."
57:13;57:14;"- They killed a dude."
57:14;57:16;"- They killed a dude."
57:16;57:17;"Just for retweets."
57:17;57:18;"- Worth it."
57:18;57:19;"- Good Lord."
57:19;57:21;"- Alice Walton cleared it."
57:21;57:23;"- I'm tired of hearing that Wendy's is more savage than us."

59:21;59:23;"We get so many good emails."
59:23;59:24;"- Can't get to all of them."
59:24;59:25;"- We can't get to all of them."
59:25;59:27;"- Some of them are very touching."
59:27;59:28;"- We get some very touching ones."
59:28;59:31;"And in fact, we got a sweet email recently"
59:31;59:33;"from a guy named Kevin Eskowitz."
59:33;59:36;"And the subject was a very sweet, chilly heat wedding."
59:36;59:40;"This is touching 'cause as time crisis"
59:40;59:41;"starts really getting up there,"
59:41;59:42;"we've been around for a minute,"
59:42;59:44;"there truly is a crew."
59:44;59:46;"- Dude, we're going on three years."
59:46;59:47;"- That's wild."
59:47;59:49;"- And we started August of '15."
59:49;59:50;"- This is episode 71, man."
59:50;59:51;"- Deep."
59:51;59:53;"- So this is an email from Kevin."
59:53;59:56;"- Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
59:56;59:59;"- Greetings, Ezra Jake and our fellow TC listeners."
59:59;01:00:01;"I wanted to share my TC love story."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"A little over 10 years ago at college in DC,"
01:00:04;01:00:06;"I met the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen."
01:00:06;01:00:08;"We started dating a bit later"
01:00:08;01:00:10;"and ""Vampire Weekend's"" debut served as a soundtrack"
01:00:10;01:00:12;"to that beautiful college romance."
01:00:12;01:00:15;"2008, man, that was a good era."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"As things go, she went abroad"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"and we took a break and life got in the way."
01:00:19;01:00:21;"After graduation, she moved to New York and I went to LA."
01:00:21;01:00:24;"- Classic, it's already a rom-com."
01:00:24;01:00:27;"- After a few years of growing up in different cities,"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"we reconnected from across the country."
01:00:29;01:00:32;"We fell back in love and decided to really go for it."
01:00:32;01:00:34;"A year later, she decided to take the leap"
01:00:34;01:00:35;"and move to LA for me."
01:00:35;01:00:37;"But she was an East Coast gal living that East Coast life"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"and I knew it would take some convincing"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"for her to really come around to this place."
01:00:41;01:00:42;"Like many who have taken the same journey,"
01:00:42;01:00:45;"she hated the fact that she had to drive everywhere"
01:00:45;01:00:46;"and it made her feel disconnected from the city"
01:00:46;01:00:47;"and its people."
01:00:47;01:00:48;"It's tough."
01:00:48;01:00:50;"I still mourn for the East Coast."
01:00:50;01:00:52;"Gotta get over there more."
01:00:52;01:00:53;"- Not me."
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- You're never looking back."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"- Nope, don't mind driving either."
01:00:56;01:00:59;"I'd rather sit in traffic than on a subway."
01:00:59;01:01:00;"- Wow."
01:01:00;01:01:00;"- Straight up."
01:01:00;01:01:04;"- Jake's takes on time crisis."
01:01:04;01:01:05;"- I mean, that makes me a bastard."
01:01:05;01:01:07;"(laughing)"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"- It took some time for her to warm up,"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"but nothing helped her to embrace this city"
01:01:11;01:01:12;"more than our Sundays driving around town"
01:01:12;01:01:15;"and cleaning up the house alongside the crisis crew."
01:01:15;01:01:16;"- Wow."
01:01:16;01:01:17;"- But it did help convert somebody, Jake."
01:01:17;01:01:19;"We are that classic TC couple."
01:01:19;01:01:21;"(laughing)"
01:01:21;01:01:24;"I love that, classic TC couple."
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Grabbing some fresh produce at the farmer's market,"
01:01:26;01:01:28;"stopping in at Home Depot and doing some laundry."
01:01:28;01:01:29;"- Woo!"
01:01:29;01:01:30;"- While learning about the tasteful palate"
01:01:30;01:01:32;"of the 70s and Starbucks-ing."
01:01:32;01:01:35;"We gotta get winter back on."
01:01:35;01:01:37;"- Let's check in with winter next episode."
01:01:37;01:01:39;"- Two Sundays ago, we were lucky enough"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"to catch the Vampire Weekend Richard Pictures Show"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"at the Livvy Bowl and got to drive back home"
01:01:43;01:01:44;"with a brand new TC on."
01:01:44;01:01:45;"- Well, that's full."
01:01:45;01:01:46;"- That's a hell of a Sunday."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"That's a hell of a Father's Day."
01:01:48;01:01:49;"- That's full integration."
01:01:49;01:01:50;"- Yeah."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"- Both bands."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"- Yeah."
01:01:52;01:01:55;"- Jake's Grateful Dead cover band, Vampire Weekend,"
01:01:55;01:01:58;"and then another two-hour radio program."
01:01:58;01:02:00;"- If we ever do another--"
01:02:00;01:02:01;"- We're dick."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"- Another kind of like Richard Pictures,"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"Vampire Weekend weekend kind of thing."
01:02:05;01:02:06;"- We have to."
01:02:06;01:02:09;"- We could, I mean, I do have a vision for it."
01:02:09;01:02:11;"It was such a smashing success the first time"
01:02:11;01:02:14;"that we kind of start adding auxiliary events."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"We could do a live time crisis."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Love it."
01:02:17;01:02:21;"- Seinfeld 2000 holds a high stakes poker match."
01:02:21;01:02:22;"- T-shirt raffle."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"- Uh-huh."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- Something."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"- Yeah, maybe Friday night."
01:02:26;01:02:27;"I'm trying to think."
01:02:27;01:02:28;"- Maybe it's three shows, dude."
01:02:28;01:02:29;"- We could do, yeah."
01:02:29;01:02:31;"- Friday, Saturday night, and Sunday morning."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Yeah."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"- Back at the Livvy Bowl, like next summer."
01:02:34;01:02:36;"- Maybe we get Alanis to come through."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"- Now you're talking."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"- Jamie Fox, friend of the show."
01:02:39;01:02:40;"- Yeah, get Jamie on the horn."
01:02:40;01:02:41;"- He's a great musician."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"- Oh, I'm aware."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- Who knows?"
01:02:44;01:02:45;"He's a born performer."
01:02:45;01:02:49;"I've witnessed him, you know, turn a dead party"
01:02:49;01:02:50;"into something really exciting."
01:02:50;01:02:54;"- I wonder if Jamie Fox remembers our episode with him."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"I'm gonna say no."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"- Yeah, it's hard to say."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- He's never thought about it since."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Let me put it that way."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"If someone reminded him of like,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"remember about three years ago,"
01:03:03;01:03:04;"you went to that little recording studio"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"on Kowanga or whatever it was,"
01:03:06;01:03:09;"and the guy from Vampire Weekend was there."
01:03:09;01:03:10;"- He might remember."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"- He'd be like, oh yeah."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"- Right, it's not like, yeah."
01:03:13;01:03:16;"- He probably hasn't had reason to bring it up."
01:03:16;01:03:20;"- I remember there was a warm Modelo"
01:03:20;01:03:22;"sitting in front of him and he cracked,"
01:03:22;01:03:24;"he looked at it like he'd never seen a Modelo before,"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"and then cracked it, took one sip,"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"and made the funniest face,"
01:03:28;01:03:31;"like this is the most disgusting thing, which is true."
01:03:31;01:03:32;"- Well, you can't blame him."
01:03:32;01:03:34;"- Room temperature Modelo is disgusting."
01:03:34;01:03:36;"And then you just like sat it down on the table,"
01:03:36;01:03:38;"like far away from him."
01:03:38;01:03:39;"- And you didn't go up to him later and say,"
01:03:39;01:03:41;"Jamie, I couldn't help but notice"
01:03:41;01:03:42;"you didn't enjoy the warm Modelo."
01:03:42;01:03:44;"I'm with you."
01:03:44;01:03:44;"- On the temperature issue."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- On the temperature issue ever."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"Don't throw out the baby with the bath water."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Can I offer you a nice cold one?"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"- Somehow that wasn't the vibe."
01:03:52;01:03:55;"- Get Dear Nora to come through, Jamie Foxx,"
01:03:55;01:03:58;"Seinfeld 2000, who else did we add on the show?"
01:03:58;01:04:00;"Dev, Dev Hines."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"- The guy that wrote the curb theme?"
01:04:02;01:04:05;"- No, the guy that wrote the Seinfeld theme."
01:04:05;01:04:06;"- Oh, T-Pain?"
01:04:06;01:04:07;"- Oh, T-Pain?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"That could be crazy."
01:04:09;01:04:10;"Another weekend in Ojai."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"That'd be pretty tight."
01:04:11;01:04:13;"- We gotta get Mayer on the show, dude."
01:04:13;01:04:14;"- Yeah, I bet we could."
01:04:14;01:04:17;"- John Mayer's Instagram is hilarious."
01:04:17;01:04:18;"- Do you follow him?"
01:04:18;01:04:18;"- Yes."
01:04:18;01:04:19;"- Really?"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"- Hannah got me really into his Instagram."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"He's like legitimately funny."
01:04:23;01:04:26;"- Even though you don't respect his lyricism?"
01:04:26;01:04:27;"- I don't."
01:04:27;01:04:28;"- Yeah."
01:04:28;01:04:29;"- I'm not a big fan of his music,"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"but I think he is like a very self-aware, funny dude."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"- He does seem self-aware."
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Yeah."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- Maybe I'll bless him with a follow."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"Jake leaving comments."
01:04:37;01:04:41;"John, although your lyricism is still lacking,"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"your tone is fairly solid."
01:04:43;01:04:45;"- John, I give your tone an eight,"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"your lyricism a four,"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"but your Instagram humor a 10."
01:04:48;01:04:50;"Keep rocking, buddy."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"(laughing)"
01:04:52;01:04:54;"John, what you lack,"
01:04:54;01:04:58;"John, what you lack in guitar lyricism,"
01:04:58;01:05:00;"you make up for in wry Instagram humor."

01:10:32;01:10:34;"for the cocktail hour."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- Ooh, I wonder what that playlist is."
01:10:35;01:10:37;"- I bet they probably pull from"
01:10:37;01:10:39;"your Tasteful 70s Palette playlist."
01:10:39;01:10:43;"- Speaking of, did you notice in Ojai during all of the--"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"- Oh, they played it."
01:10:44;01:10:46;"- Yeah, they were playing the Tasteful Palette playlist."
01:10:46;01:10:47;"Was that your call?"
01:10:47;01:10:48;"- Yeah, that was my call."
01:10:48;01:10:49;"- Nice dude."
01:10:49;01:10:52;"- 'Cause that's one of the things that I always forget about."
01:10:52;01:10:53;"I always have these like grand visions"
01:10:53;01:10:56;"about what type of music to play in between shows."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"And then almost always it's like I'm stressed out"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"and like warming up and somebody's like,"
01:10:59;01:11:01;"oh, do you know what you wanna play?"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"And so then I was like, oh, Jake's Tasteful Palette playlist."
01:11:03;01:11:08;"- And then actually, sidebar, your road manager, Brian,"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"had me make a playlist for the Santa Ana shows."
01:11:10;01:11:11;"- Oh."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"- Don't know if you noticed it."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"It was similar theme."
01:11:14;01:11:15;"- I'm always like--"
01:11:15;01:11:15;"- I got you."
01:11:15;01:11:19;"- I'm tired away warming up and inhaling steam"
01:11:19;01:11:19;"and all the things I do before a show."
01:11:19;01:11:20;"- Meditating, yeah."
01:11:20;01:11:22;"- Meditating before the show."
01:11:22;01:11:26;"But I was up in one of the backstage rooms"
01:11:26;01:11:30;"at the observatory and through the floorboards,"
01:11:30;01:11:33;"I could kind of hear two big star songs in a row."
01:11:33;01:11:35;"And I wondered."
01:11:35;01:11:37;"- Okay, I don't even remember, but yeah."
01:11:37;01:11:37;"- Was there a big star on it?"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"- I'm sure there was."
01:11:39;01:11:40;"- Anyway, they say, ""Thanks for always riding shotgun"
01:11:40;01:11:41;"""on our Sundays."
01:11:41;01:11:43;"""Much love, Kevin and Betsy."""
01:11:43;01:11:44;"Well, you know--"
01:11:44;01:11:45;"- Hell of an email."
01:11:45;01:11:46;"- Hell of an email."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"We kind of, I mean, I don't know if I'm reading"
01:11:48;01:11:49;"between the lines too much,"
01:11:49;01:11:53;"but it sounds like Time Crisis saved their marriage."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"Created their marriage."
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Two people coming back together,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"making the big leap move in LA, not feeling it."
01:11:58;01:12:01;"TC is the glue."
01:12:01;01:12:02;"- That Sunday glue."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"Listening live together is strong."
01:12:04;01:12:05;"- Yeah, I'm into that."
01:12:05;01:12:07;"TC couples."
01:12:07;01:12:07;"Love these kind of emails."
01:12:07;01:12:11;"If you got any kind of TC situation,"
01:12:11;01:12:13;"and like we said, it doesn't have to be"
01:12:13;01:12:14;"a romantic relationship."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Just be friends."
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Just a group of friends who come together"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"to listen to live internet radio."
01:12:20;01:12:23;"Honestly, I wish I had that in my own life."
01:12:23;01:12:26;"I wish there was a, what's the Time Crisis for me"
01:12:26;01:12:27;"that I could listen to?"
01:12:27;01:12:28;"- Howard."
01:12:28;01:12:30;"- Howard."
01:12:30;01:12:32;"I guess it's cool that this show's on a Sunday."
01:12:32;01:12:34;"I never really thought about it that much."
01:12:34;01:12:35;"- Yeah."
01:12:35;01:12:37;"- It gives it a different kind of energy."
01:12:37;01:12:41;"Yeah, imagine if this show just aired 9 p.m. on Tuesdays."
01:12:41;01:12:42;"- Wouldn't seem as special."
01:12:42;01:12:44;"- This is a Sunday afternoon show."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Anyway, shout out to Kevin and Betsy"

01:15:23;01:15:28;"- Okay, so this week on the Time Crisis, top five."
01:15:28;01:15:29;"- This is a complicated one."
01:15:29;01:15:31;"- It is a little complex."
01:15:31;01:15:34;"So everybody at home, I want you to grab a pencil and paper"
01:15:34;01:15:36;"and chart this thing out."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"We're not doing our usual just top five songs"
01:15:38;01:15:41;"on iTunes versus Billboard of the past."
01:15:41;01:15:45;"We're looking at two different lists of summer songs."
01:15:45;01:15:48;"- 'Cause Summer Solstice has happened last week, right?"
01:15:48;01:15:49;"- 'Cause we're officially in summer."
01:15:49;01:15:50;"Can you believe it?"
01:15:50;01:15:51;"- No, I can't."
01:15:51;01:15:52;"The year's half over, it's insane."
01:15:52;01:15:53;"- That's crazy."
01:15:53;01:15:54;"- I don't like that."
01:15:54;01:15:57;"- We're comparing a Billboard list"
01:15:57;01:15:58;"of the songs of the summer."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"And this is Billboard kind of speculating"
01:16:00;01:16:04;"based on radio airplay, sales data, blah, blah, blah,"
01:16:04;01:16:07;"what they think the songs of this summer are."
01:16:07;01:16:08;"- Whoa, so they're, okay."
01:16:08;01:16:10;"- So it's a Billboard list of the speculative songs"
01:16:10;01:16:11;"of this summer."
01:16:11;01:16:12;"- Kind of jumping the gun."
01:16:12;01:16:15;"- Well, that's what we do on the clickbait economy."
01:16:15;01:16:16;"- Okay."
01:16:16;01:16:17;"- Billboard's calling it."
01:16:17;01:16:18;"- I don't know if I like it."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"There's songs that are gonna come out next week."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"- Billboard's calling it now."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"- Oh, Drake."
01:16:24;01:16:25;"Cool."
01:16:25;01:16:27;"I'm already negative about it."
01:16:27;01:16:30;"- Then we're gonna compare that to Rolling Stone."
01:16:30;01:16:31;"- Yeah."
01:16:31;01:16:34;"- Who has their list of just the top five songs of all time."
01:16:34;01:16:35;"So in a way, we're still--"
01:16:35;01:16:36;"- Summer songs."
01:16:37;01:16:39;"So we are comparing old and new again."
01:16:39;01:16:40;"- Okay."
01:16:40;01:16:41;"- So according to Rolling Stone,"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"the number five summer song of all time,"
01:16:43;01:16:45;"Rockaway Beach by the Ramones."
01:16:45;01:16:46;"- Okay."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"- One, two, three, four."
01:16:48;01:16:49;"(rock music)"
01:16:49;01:16:51;"- I always liked this song."
01:16:51;01:16:53;"Five seems a little high."
01:16:53;01:16:54;"- Yeah."

01:21:42;01:21:44;"he's talking about juicing fruits and vegetables."
01:21:44;01:21:48;"But then I was thinking, maybe he's talking roids."

01:22:02;01:22:03;"So we just got some info"
01:22:03;01:22:06;"that originally he was called Juice the Kid."
01:22:06;01:22:09;"And calling yourself Juice is classic."
01:22:09;01:22:12;"You don't need to explain that."
01:22:12;01:22:13;"And Juice is a positive thing."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"- It's classic?"
01:22:14;01:22:17;"- OJ called him Juice."
01:22:17;01:22:21;"And Juice is generally whatever slang version you use."
01:22:21;01:22:22;"It's like a positive thing."

01:22:25;01:22:28;"- I just think it was David Schwimmer going, juice."
01:22:28;01:22:30;"- Wait, what is that from Friends?"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"- No, from the OJ show."
01:22:32;01:22:35;"- Oh, oh, David Schwimmer playing Kardashian."
01:22:35;01:22:36;"- Juice."

01:22:40;01:22:41;"So anyway, Juice the Kid."
01:22:41;01:22:42;"So he was Juice the Kid,"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"and then he kind of got classed it up"
01:22:44;01:22:46;"and called it Juice WRLD,"

01:22:47;01:22:49;"- All right, cool."

01:28:37;01:28:41;"I wish they all could be California."
01:28:41;01:28:46;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:28:46;01:28:53;"Is he saying--"
01:28:53;01:28:54;"Wait, yeah, I don't understand."
01:28:54;01:28:55;"Beat or be?"
01:28:55;01:28:59;"I wish they all could be--"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"Beat?"
01:29:00;01:29:01;"Yeah, like--"
01:29:01;01:29:03;"I wish they all could be California girls."
01:29:03;01:29:04;"For the longest time, I thought it was beat."
01:29:04;01:29:07;"Like, I wish-- like, in a way, it was almost"
01:29:07;01:29:08;"like a generous sentiment."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"Like, I wish they could all measure up."
01:29:11;01:29:13;"I mean, it's kind of the same sentiment, really."
01:29:13;01:29:14;"You mean he's--"
01:29:14;01:29:16;"I don't know why I thought it was beat."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Like, I wish they could all top California girls."
01:29:18;01:29:20;"Wait, actually, I want to check, because I just"
01:29:20;01:29:23;"realized I don't know what this song's really about."
01:29:23;01:29:27;"I wish they could all be California girls."
01:29:27;01:29:30;"(SINGING) Because the West Coast has the sunshine,"
01:29:30;01:29:35;"and the girls all get so tan."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"I dig a French bikini."
01:29:38;01:29:39;"On Hawaii Island?"
01:29:39;01:29:40;"Is that what it is?"
01:29:40;01:29:41;"Dolls by a palm tree in the--"
01:29:41;01:29:42;"oh, wait, hold on."
01:29:42;01:29:43;"We got to break this song down."
01:29:43;01:29:45;"Verse one-- see, this is what's funny."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"He basically--"
01:29:46;01:29:48;"Here we go, 20 minutes."
01:29:48;01:29:49;"We're about to do a whole 20."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"We're going to need to preempt the next show."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"Push into hour three."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"This is going to be a four-hour TC."
01:29:55;01:30:00;"So the first verse of this is, ""East Coast girls are hip."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"I really dig those styles they wear."""
01:30:01;01:30:03;"And then he lists all these other girls"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"and how great they are."
01:30:04;01:30:06;"""Southern girls, with the way they talk,"
01:30:06;01:30:08;"they knock me out when I'm down there."""
01:30:08;01:30:10;"Like, Southern accents."
01:30:10;01:30:11;"So he's just saying, all these girls are great."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"And then with no transition--"
01:30:13;01:30:16;"so, like, it ends, ""And the northern girls,"
01:30:16;01:30:17;"with the way they kiss, they keep their boyfriends warm"
01:30:17;01:30:18;"at night."""
01:30:19;01:30:22;"And then just hard change--"
01:30:22;01:30:27;"""I wish they all could be California girls."""
01:30:27;01:30:29;"It's like, there's not--"
01:30:29;01:30:31;"in another song, then there'd be, like, a pre-chorus,"
01:30:31;01:30:35;"where it's kind of like, ""However great all these girls"
01:30:35;01:30:38;"are, I'm a California boy."""
01:30:38;01:30:41;"And so it's just like this weird hard cut, where you just, like--"
01:30:41;01:30:42;"Well, it's concise, man."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"We understand the logic."
01:30:44;01:30:46;"OK, but is it so clear?"
01:30:46;01:30:47;"It's not as clear as it seems."
01:30:47;01:30:48;"Think about-- there was, like-- this is probably"
01:30:48;01:30:50;"like 17-year-old dudes writing a song."
01:30:50;01:30:54;"[laughter]"
01:30:54;01:30:57;"But here's what my question--"
01:30:57;01:31:01;"when you list all these great girls around the country,"
01:31:01;01:31:02;"he doesn't have a bad word to say about them."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"They're all great."
01:31:04;01:31:05;"And then he says, ""I wish they all"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"could be California girls."""
01:31:07;01:31:12;"Is he saying that California girls are better than them?"
01:31:12;01:31:15;"Or is he saying that, ""I wish--"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"when I go around the country, and I"
01:31:17;01:31:20;"see these other great types of girls,"
01:31:20;01:31:22;"I'm blown away by how amazing they are."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"But because they don't live in California,"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"they don't exist to me."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"I wish that these hip East Coast girls--"
01:31:28;01:31:29;"They could all move there."
01:31:29;01:31:32;"I wish they could all move to California."""
01:31:32;01:31:33;"Is that what he's saying?"
01:31:33;01:31:33;"No."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"So what's he saying?"
01:31:35;01:31:37;"I understand the logic of what you're saying,"
01:31:37;01:31:39;"and it sort of relates to what I thought it was for years,"
01:31:39;01:31:43;"which I wish they could all beat California girls."
01:31:43;01:31:44;"Right."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"Because he loves the Midwest farmer's daughter."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"She makes him feel all right."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"Son, I wish I could accept you at this university,"
01:31:51;01:31:55;"but your grades just are not up to snuff."
01:31:55;01:31:57;"That's what he's kind of saying?"
01:31:57;01:31:58;"Yeah."
01:31:58;01:31:59;"So he's saying--"
01:31:59;01:32:00;"That's the implication."
01:32:00;01:32:02;"I've been all around this country."
01:32:02;01:32:04;"I've met so many amazing girls."
01:32:04;01:32:07;"And here's some of the great things I've learned about them."
01:32:07;01:32:08;"It's like ""The Bachelor."""
01:32:08;01:32:10;"However, at the end of the day, I'm"
01:32:10;01:32:13;"giving my rose to California girls because--"
01:32:13;01:32:13;"the rest of you."
01:32:13;01:32:14;"That's what he's saying?"
01:32:14;01:32:15;"Yes."
01:32:16;01:32:17;"I think he's saying that he wishes that California would"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"encompass the entire US."
01:32:19;01:32:21;"Oh, wow."
01:32:21;01:32:22;"Well, I don't know about that."
01:32:22;01:32:24;"Or maybe it's like a Romeo and Juliet thing."
01:32:24;01:32:26;"Maybe his dad's real conservative,"
01:32:26;01:32:29;"doesn't like him dating outside California."
01:32:29;01:32:31;"Well, this is why the song has legs."
01:32:31;01:32:33;"It's a truly mysterious chorus."
01:32:33;01:32:34;"My family--"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"Wish they could all be California girls."
01:32:37;01:32:41;"The Wilson family's been in California for over 32 years."
01:32:41;01:32:43;"We have deep roots here."
01:32:43;01:32:48;"And if my father caught me necking with a hippie's coast"
01:32:48;01:32:51;"girl, he would beat the shit out of me."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"I'm sorry."
01:32:52;01:32:55;"It's not right, but that's just how it has to be."
01:32:55;01:32:57;"I can only date a California girl."
01:32:57;01:32:59;"I wish you could be."
01:32:59;01:33:00;"Well, I can be--"
01:33:00;01:33:03;"well, I can be a California girl, Brian."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"All I have to do is move."
01:33:04;01:33:06;"It's the same country."
01:33:06;01:33:07;"Doesn't count."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"Nope."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"Nope."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"My family doesn't recognize conversions."
01:33:11;01:33:14;"The West Coast has the sunshine."
01:33:14;01:33:16;"Is there anything else to this?"
01:33:16;01:33:17;"And the girls."
01:33:17;01:33:20;"Yeah, there's no more information."
01:33:20;01:33:22;"I guess then at the end he says, I've"
01:33:22;01:33:24;"been all around this great big world,"
01:33:24;01:33:26;"and I've seen all kinds of girls."
01:33:26;01:33:28;"Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back to the States,"
01:33:28;01:33:31;"back to the cutest girls in the world."
01:33:31;01:33:33;"But see, again, now he's saying American girls are cuter"
01:33:33;01:33:35;"than the rest of the world?"
01:33:35;01:33:37;"Imagine if there was an extended version where he's"
01:33:37;01:33:41;"talking about French girls and Italian girls."
01:33:41;01:33:44;"There's that Rick Nelson song ""Traveling Man"""
01:33:44;01:33:45;"that's in that vein."
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Rough stuff."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"The number four song on the Billboard list"
01:33:51;01:33:53;"of the potential songs of the summer."
01:33:53;01:33:54;"Potential?"
01:33:54;01:33:55;"That's the best list."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"No surprise here, Drake, ""God's Plan."""
01:33:57;01:33:59;"Uh-huh."
01:33:59;01:34:00;"This came out in like February or something."
01:34:00;01:34:01;"Yeah, this song is--"
01:34:01;01:34:02;"Not a song."
01:34:02;01:34:03;"It's losing steam by now."
01:34:03;01:34:04;"It already peaked."
01:34:04;01:34:07;"[music - ""god's plan""]"
01:34:07;01:34:10;"Yo."
01:34:10;01:34:13;"I've been moving calm, don't start no trouble with me."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"Trying to keep it peaceful is a struggle for me."
01:34:15;01:34:16;"I wonder if Mike Lobs heard this."
01:34:16;01:34:19;"Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me."
01:34:19;01:34:22;"You know how I like it when you loving on me."
01:34:22;01:34:25;"I don't want to die for them to miss me."
01:34:25;01:34:28;"Yes, I see the things that they wishing on me."
01:34:28;01:34:32;"Hope I got some brothers that'll live me."
01:34:32;01:34:35;"They gon' tell the story, it was different with me."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"God's plan."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"God's plan."
01:34:39;01:34:42;"I hold back sometimes I won't."
01:34:42;01:34:45;"I feel good sometimes I don't."
01:34:45;01:34:48;"I finesse down Western road like this."
01:34:48;01:34:51;"Might go down to GOD."
01:34:51;01:34:58;"I go hard on Southside G. I make sure that Northside eat."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"And still."
01:35:00;01:35:05;"Drake, a lot more nuanced talk about life and relationships"
01:35:05;01:35:06;"than California girls."
01:35:06;01:35:08;"How old is Drake, you think, like 30?"
01:35:09;01:35:09;"Yeah."
01:35:09;01:35:10;"OK."
01:35:10;01:35:12;"Beach Boys were like 17, 18."
01:35:12;01:35:13;"When they wrote California Girls."
01:35:13;01:35:14;"Maybe 20."
01:35:14;01:35:15;"Bad things."
01:35:15;01:35:16;"It's a lot of bad things."
01:35:16;01:35:18;"[laughter]"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"[sigh]"
01:35:20;01:35:22;"The number three song on Rolling Stone's list."

01:35:25;01:35:27;"East Coast girls are hip."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"The number three song on the Rolling Stone list, Alice"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"Cooper, School's Out."
01:35:31;01:35:31;"OK."
01:35:31;01:35:32;"Kind of a weird choice."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"Very young."
01:35:43;01:35:44;"Very young girls here."
01:35:48;01:35:52;"This is just hilarious."
01:35:52;01:35:53;"Like '70s hard rock."
01:35:53;01:35:59;"Like Led Zeppelin writing about hobbits."
01:35:59;01:36:00;"Yeah."
01:36:00;01:36:03;"Black Savages being about the meaninglessness of life"
01:36:03;01:36:05;"and just like brutal satanic shit."
01:36:05;01:36:07;"Alice Cooper should be my favorite."

01:36:08;01:36:09;"[laughter]"
01:36:12;01:36:27;"This song is a good arrangement."
01:36:27;01:36:28;"I like the transition into the chorus."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"Yeah, the chorus is dope."
01:36:32;01:36:34;"One, two, pieces."
01:36:38;01:36:48;"No more pencils."
01:36:48;01:36:52;"No more books."
01:36:52;01:36:55;"No more teachers."
01:36:55;01:36:58;"Daddy love."
01:37:05;01:37:16;"Well, we got no class."
01:37:16;01:37:20;"And we got no principles."
01:37:20;01:37:23;"And we got no innocence."
01:37:23;01:37:27;"We can't even think of a word that rhymes."
01:37:28;01:37:31;"School's out for summer."

01:38:10;01:38:13;"like dead ass listening to ""School's Out"" just at home,"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"just like super serious, just like headphones on,"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"just be like, oh, god, I fucking hate school."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"I can't wait for summer."
01:38:20;01:38:23;"Just like finally, somebody's telling it like it is."
01:38:23;01:38:24;"Yes."
01:38:24;01:38:26;"Just like super serious."
01:38:26;01:38:27;"Yes."

01:40:16;01:40:18;"Have you studied it?"
01:40:18;01:40:20;"I took it for years, probably eight years."
01:40:20;01:40:22;"Can you get anything out of it?"
01:40:22;01:40:22;"I'm learning it."
01:40:22;01:40:23;"[non-english speech]"
01:40:23;01:40:36;"Oh, viva la raza."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"That's--"
01:40:37;01:40:38;"What does that mean?"
01:40:38;01:40:40;"--familiar phrase."
01:40:40;01:40:45;"I'm like viva la raza, like la raza referring to the people."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"Long live the race."
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Sounds a little scary when you say it in English."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"That's not a phrase you want to hear in English."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"A couple white guys on the mic, long live the race."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"Yeah, you don't want to hear that."
01:40:57;01:40:59;"But viva la raza, you see that here and there."
01:40:59;01:41:02;"I can't follow Spanish at all when it's spoken."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"What about when it's sung or rapped?"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"Even less so."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"Even less so?"
01:41:06;01:41:07;"You know why?"
01:41:07;01:41:08;"They don't enunciate."
01:41:08;01:41:11;"You got to enunciate."
01:41:11;01:41:14;"I feel like Spanish rappers enunciate even more."
01:41:14;01:41:17;"Do they?"
01:41:17;01:41:18;"I don't understand Spanish at all,"
01:41:18;01:41:20;"but I feel like when I listen to Spanish music,"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"it's the language that I feel like I, in some weird way,"
01:41:23;01:41:24;"follow."
01:41:24;01:41:27;"When I hear a story song, I almost"
01:41:27;01:41:28;"feel like just through the emotion of the vocal,"
01:41:28;01:41:30;"I can follow it a little bit."
01:41:30;01:41:32;"You studied French."
01:41:32;01:41:34;"I studied French, big mistake."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"I like it."
01:41:35;01:41:37;"I don't know, that might be my pick for song of the summer."
01:41:37;01:41:39;"It's just plain fun."
01:41:39;01:41:41;"I was actually thinking about it, because--"
01:41:41;01:41:42;"It's just plain fun."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"I just always hear that in the chorus."
01:41:44;01:41:45;"OK, grandpa."
01:41:46;01:41:47;"It's good, clean fun."
01:41:47;01:41:49;"I always hear it in ubers."
01:41:49;01:41:51;"And actually, the thing, Cardi B's songs,"
01:41:51;01:41:53;"there's always these little lines that just stick with you."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"They're very sticky."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"In fact, before the show, for whatever reason,"
01:41:56;01:41:58;"I had one of the lines that said,"
01:41:58;01:42:03;"I like texas from my exes when they want a second chance."
01:42:03;01:42:05;"Also, some of the lyrics in this,"
01:42:05;01:42:09;"almost nobody else could pull off besides Cardi B."
01:42:09;01:42:12;"As we said on the show, she's incredibly charismatic."
01:42:12;01:42:14;"It's just fun to hear her."
01:42:14;01:42:19;"And for instance, she goes, he's so handsome, what's his name?"
01:42:19;01:42:22;"That line is right on the border of being super corny,"
01:42:22;01:42:24;"but also kind of cute and fun."
01:42:24;01:42:26;"There's other people who would have that line"
01:42:26;01:42:27;"and would just be like, ugh."
01:42:27;01:42:29;"Right."
01:42:29;01:42:30;"But with Cardi B, she brings that playfulness,"
01:42:30;01:42:32;"but she's also kind of tough."
01:42:32;01:42:33;"She's got it all."
01:42:33;01:42:36;"He's so handsome, what's his name?"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Taylor would have a tough time pulling that one off."
01:42:38;01:42:40;"He's so handsome, what's his name?"
01:42:40;01:42:40;"Yeah, that--"
01:42:40;01:42:41;"Name."
01:42:41;01:42:43;"What's his name?"
01:42:43;01:42:46;"Well, Taylor, his name is Jordan."
01:42:46;01:42:49;"[laughter]"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"He's so handsome, what's his name?"
01:42:51;01:42:53;"[laughter]"
01:42:53;01:42:57;"Everybody finds their own voice one way or another."
01:42:57;01:43:00;"The number two song on the Rolling Stone list--"
01:43:00;01:43:03;"the Rolling Stone list is kind of boring, I got to admit."
01:43:03;01:43:06;"I think the Billboard list is just more interesting."
01:43:06;01:43:08;"The number two-- I guess because Rolling Stone was just"
01:43:08;01:43:10;"trying to be like, the song's explicitly about summer."
01:43:10;01:43:11;"Right, let's not."
01:43:11;01:43:13;"They weren't just kind of going for like, yeah,"
01:43:13;01:43:15;"songs that came out in the summer that give you"
01:43:15;01:43:17;"an oblique summer vibe."

01:43:18;01:43:20;"Oh, wow, this is real."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"I mean, it's a good song."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"[music - ""summertime blues""]"
01:43:24;01:43:29;"What year is this?"
01:43:29;01:43:30;"That's a good question."
01:43:30;01:43:32;"(SINGING) I'm a gonna raise a fuss."
01:43:32;01:43:33;"I'm a gonna raise a holler."
01:43:33;01:43:41;"About a working old summer just to try to earn a dollar."

01:43:49;01:43:52;"Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do."
01:43:52;01:43:55;"But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
01:43:55;01:43:56;"This is a good song."
01:43:56;01:43:57;"You can't deny it."
01:43:57;01:43:59;"Yeah, it's dope."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"This was on the La Bamba soundtrack."
01:44:01;01:44:03;"Which was a big sound--"
01:44:03;01:44:08;"like, tape in our household, circa '87, '88."
01:44:08;01:44:10;"Los Lobos covered all these old--"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"Oh, yeah, like La Bamba."
01:44:11;01:44:14;"Yeah, Buddy Holly songs, Big Bopper songs."
01:44:14;01:44:16;"This was on there."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"(SINGING) Oh, well, I didn't go to work."
01:44:17;01:44:18;"Oh, the boss I was--"
01:44:18;01:44:19;"I associate this song with--"
01:44:19;01:44:22;"(SINGING) --can't use a car 'cause you didn't work a leg."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"My dad getting a speeding ticket one time."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"Really?"
01:44:25;01:44:26;"We were in his Honda."
01:44:26;01:44:30;"And he was just, like, tearing ass, blasting--"
01:44:30;01:44:31;"Blasting this?"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"Blasting the La Bamba soundtrack."
01:44:32;01:44:33;"Got pulled over."
01:44:33;01:44:36;"Take it."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"10-year-old son in the front seat."
01:44:37;01:44:40;"(SINGING) --two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation."

01:44:42;01:44:45;"I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations."
01:44:45;01:44:47;"United Nations."
01:44:47;01:44:50;"Actually, that part always made a big impression on me."
01:44:50;01:44:52;"I remember, like, listening to this random ass song,"
01:44:52;01:44:54;"where the guy's just like, I've got to work all summer."
01:44:54;01:44:56;"It sucks."
01:44:56;01:44:56;"I do this and that."
01:44:56;01:44:57;"It sucks."
01:44:57;01:45:00;"And then he's like, I'm going to the United Nations."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"It's like, OK."
01:45:01;01:45:04;"This guy's ambitious."
01:45:04;01:45:06;"Take it there, dude."
01:45:06;01:45:12;"I'm going to take my problem to the United Nations."
01:45:12;01:45:13;"Solid song."
01:45:13;01:45:17;"The number two song on the speculative billboard list,"
01:45:17;01:45:18;"Post Malone's ""Psycho."""
01:45:18;01:45:21;"This is a big song."
01:45:21;01:45:23;"I've been hearing this a lot."
01:45:23;01:45:28;"All the tones on these newer songs are hilarious."

01:45:38;01:45:40;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:40;01:45:41;"It's an interesting tone."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"It's like sauna."
01:45:43;01:45:45;"Ambient music in a sauna palette."
01:45:45;01:45:46;"You know what's funny?"
01:45:46;01:45:48;"I was actually-- I was getting a ride back from the Santa Ana"
01:45:48;01:45:49;"show."
01:45:49;01:45:51;"We were listening to that song."
01:45:51;01:45:52;"My boy Brian was driving."
01:45:52;01:45:55;"And he said, I understand the whole chorus,"
01:45:55;01:45:57;"except for one line."
01:45:57;01:45:58;"OK."
01:45:58;01:45:59;"And I'll play it again."
01:45:59;01:46:01;"(SINGING) --one more bell like Michael."
01:46:01;01:46:04;"Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you."
01:46:04;01:46:06;"My roof look like an on show."
01:46:06;01:46:08;"Got diamonds by the boatload."
01:46:08;01:46:09;"This is the verse or the chorus?"
01:46:09;01:46:10;"That's the chorus."
01:46:10;01:46:12;"It's one of these classic kind of long--"
01:46:12;01:46:13;"Right."
01:46:13;01:46:15;"So he says, got diamonds by the boatload."
01:46:15;01:46:16;"That's not hard to understand."
01:46:16;01:46:18;"That's a lot of diamonds."
01:46:18;01:46:20;"He said-- and he says, come with the Tony Romo."
01:46:20;01:46:23;"(SINGING) --come with the Tony Romo for closing all the doors."
01:46:23;01:46:24;"Come with the Tony Romo."
01:46:24;01:46:26;"The QB?"
01:46:26;01:46:27;"Yeah."
01:46:27;01:46:29;"Not Tony Romo's."
01:46:29;01:46:32;"The chain restaurant."
01:46:32;01:46:35;"Because that's with an A, Roma."
01:46:35;01:46:37;"Yeah, Tony Romo's."
01:46:37;01:46:38;"OK."
01:46:38;01:46:39;"It's like an Olive Garden."
01:46:39;01:46:40;"Actually, I've never really been there."
01:46:40;01:46:41;"I've always been confused by that,"
01:46:41;01:46:43;"because I wondered if Tony Romo started it,"
01:46:43;01:46:45;"because football players often start"
01:46:45;01:46:47;"like that type of restaurant."
01:46:47;01:46:49;"I think it was around before his career was really--"
01:46:49;01:46:51;"Right, yeah, it's older."
01:46:51;01:46:54;"No, so he's talking about the football player."
01:46:54;01:46:56;"So I looked it up for my friend, because I"
01:46:56;01:46:57;"didn't have the answer."
01:46:57;01:47:01;"He comes with the Tony Romo to deal with the bozos."
01:47:01;01:47:02;"So that's pushing it."
01:47:02;01:47:04;"This is what it says on the internet."
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Well, and also, Post Malone grew up in Texas."
01:47:07;01:47:10;"Diehard Dallas Cowboys fan, which is the team that I"
01:47:10;01:47:12;"believe Tony Romo played for."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"I guess so."
01:47:14;01:47:15;"Yeah, confirmed."
01:47:15;01:47:18;"You listen to ""Time Crisis"" sports talk."
01:47:18;01:47:20;"Who did Tony Romo play for again?"
01:47:20;01:47:22;"The Dallas Mavericks?"
01:47:22;01:47:23;"Cowboys, I mean."
01:47:23;01:47:27;"Cool joke."
01:47:27;01:47:30;"We got Phil calling in from Houston."
01:47:30;01:47:31;"Today we're talking about--"
01:47:32;01:47:34;"we're talking about the upcoming football season."
01:47:34;01:47:37;"The question of the day is, what team did Tony Romo play for?"
01:47:37;01:47:38;"We're trying to get to the bottom of this."
01:47:38;01:47:40;"Phil, you got any insight?"
01:47:40;01:47:42;"OK, Phil's saying Dallas Cowboys."
01:47:42;01:47:43;"Not sure about that one."
01:47:43;01:47:45;"But anyway."
01:47:45;01:47:46;"Back to the phones."
01:47:46;01:47:48;"Back to the phones."
01:47:48;01:47:52;"Yeah, just like, do a really serious sports talk radio show"
01:47:52;01:47:56;"where we're just asking real questions about what"
01:47:56;01:47:58;"really is a touchdown."
01:47:58;01:48:00;"I mean, we're all football fans."
01:48:00;01:48:02;"We think we know what a touchdown is."
01:48:02;01:48:03;"But how would you define it?"
01:48:03;01:48:05;"Call in and give us your take."
01:48:05;01:48:07;"So Tony Romo-- this is what the internet said."
01:48:07;01:48:10;"Tony Romo played for the Dallas Cowboys."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"And he always wore the same number."
01:48:12;01:48:15;"OK, isn't that pretty normal?"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"You get a number, you wear that for your career."
01:48:17;01:48:18;"No, that's-- no, I wasn't done."
01:48:18;01:48:19;"Oh."
01:48:19;01:48:22;"The number nine."
01:48:22;01:48:24;"OK."
01:48:24;01:48:26;"You following this?"
01:48:26;01:48:27;"He wore the number nine."
01:48:27;01:48:29;"Now go back to the context."
01:48:29;01:48:33;"I come with the Tony Romo and something for the bozos."
01:48:33;01:48:36;"OK, he's got the boatload of diamonds."
01:48:36;01:48:38;"Don't worry about the diamonds anymore."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"He's rolling in."
01:48:40;01:48:42;"He's wearing a jersey."
01:48:42;01:48:43;"He's wearing a Tony Romo--"
01:48:43;01:48:50;"he's bought into a partial stake at Dallas area Tony"
01:48:50;01:48:54;"Roma's restaurants."
01:48:54;01:48:56;"No, here's the full line."
01:48:56;01:48:58;"Plain English, here we go."
01:48:58;01:49:03;"Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos."
01:49:03;01:49:07;"I don't understand how nine is a significant part of this."
01:49:07;01:49:09;"Well, what else does the number nine refer to?"
01:49:09;01:49:14;"OK, so let's take out the Tony Romo."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"There could be a lot of things, dude."
01:49:17;01:49:19;"There's nine players and a baseball diamond."
01:49:19;01:49:21;"That's why Post Malone is a genius."
01:49:21;01:49:26;"He uses football as a metaphor for a baseball team."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"No, so think about it."
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Replace Tony Romo for nine."
01:49:30;01:49:33;"I come with the nine for clowns and all the bozos."
01:49:33;01:49:35;"Oh, he's bringing a gun."
01:49:35;01:49:37;"That's right."
01:49:37;01:49:39;"That is a stretch."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"And the thing that I'm not sure about"
01:49:41;01:49:45;"is, is that a thing that people say,"
01:49:45;01:49:49;"or is this just a Dallas Cowboys fan who's now"
01:49:49;01:49:51;"become a famous rapper just throwing in something kind"
01:49:51;01:49:53;"of special for his community?"
01:49:53;01:49:55;"I hope it's that."
01:49:55;01:49:59;"I have never heard of that before, but I can't say for sure."
01:49:59;01:50:02;"Also, I don't follow football closely enough to be like,"
01:50:02;01:50:04;"oh, Tony Romo, of course it's nine."
01:50:04;01:50:05;"Right."
01:50:05;01:50:07;"Yeah, it's not like he's referencing Jordan."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"23."
01:50:08;01:50:08;"Yeah."
01:50:08;01:50:09;"There you go."
01:50:09;01:50:11;"Yeah."
01:50:11;01:50:13;"I'll do that in a song, something like 23 and me."
01:50:13;01:50:15;"Is LeBron 23 too?"
01:50:15;01:50:17;"I think he is."
01:50:17;01:50:18;"That's confusing."
01:50:18;01:50:20;"So he must have done that because he just loves Jordan."
01:50:20;01:50:22;"He's just like, I'm the next Jordan."
01:50:22;01:50:23;"I'm going to be 23."
01:50:23;01:50:25;"I wonder what Jordan thought of that."
01:50:25;01:50:28;"He's like, damn, son."
01:50:28;01:50:28;"You better deliver."
01:50:28;01:50:30;"You listen to the time crisis."
01:50:30;01:50:31;"We're talking about today."
01:50:31;01:50:35;"Do you think Jordan's feelings were hurt when LeBron--"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"just to pick up like--"
01:50:36;01:50:40;"Do you think Michael Jordan felt affronted when a young LeBron--"
01:50:40;01:50:41;"has he always been 23?"
01:50:41;01:50:46;"The thing you got to understand about a guy like Michael Jordan"
01:50:46;01:50:48;"is that it can be very isolating to be"
01:50:48;01:50:50;"that rich and that successful."
01:50:50;01:50:56;"We sometimes take it as a given that a major wealthy celebrity"
01:50:56;01:50:58;"is going to feel very confident."
01:50:58;01:51:02;"But for all we know, when Michael Jordan"
01:51:02;01:51:04;"saw that LeBron took the number, it's"
01:51:04;01:51:06;"possible his feelings were hurt."
01:51:06;01:51:09;"He might have felt like, is my day over?"
01:51:09;01:51:10;"Are people going to forget about me?"
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Is this kid replacing me?"
01:51:12;01:51:15;"Michael's the most competitive guy I've ever met."
01:51:15;01:51:19;"No one competes harder than Michael Jordan."
01:51:19;01:51:21;"This guy likes to compete."
01:51:21;01:51:24;"He likes to have his own numbers."
01:51:24;01:51:25;"He has his own house."
01:51:25;01:51:26;"He has his own shoe."
01:51:26;01:51:27;"He has his own company."
01:51:27;01:51:31;"I can't see this guy being happy about this one."
01:51:31;01:51:34;"Not for one minute."
01:51:34;01:51:39;"There's like such specific sports radio voices."
01:51:39;01:51:43;"Can you imagine listening to that stuff for like hours?"
01:51:43;01:51:44;"People do it."
01:51:44;01:51:45;"That's amazing."
01:51:45;01:51:47;"And then it's like, OK, and now we're"
01:51:47;01:51:48;"going to go to like a 12-minute ad break."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"[laughter]"
01:51:50;01:51:56;"You're listening to ""Time Crisis"" on Beats 1."
01:51:56;01:51:59;"[sigh]"
01:51:59;01:52:00;"I mean, I'm sure--"
01:52:00;01:52:01;"Oh, man."
01:52:01;01:52:03;"I'm sure, especially now in the podcast era, there probably"
01:52:03;01:52:04;"is a--"
01:52:04;01:52:06;"I could see you coming in one day and being like, yo,"
01:52:06;01:52:08;"I'm really into a baseball podcast."
01:52:08;01:52:10;"I've tried."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"But there wasn't one that kind of like spoke your language?"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"I just don't follow the game close enough anymore."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"I can't follow what they're talking about."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"Maybe we really should do a sports podcast."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"I liked when--"
01:52:19;01:52:21;"""Not Known Squat."""
01:52:21;01:52:23;"Wait, when we watched the World Series that time,"
01:52:23;01:52:26;"weren't you the one who was telling me all the back story?"
01:52:26;01:52:27;"Maybe."
01:52:27;01:52:29;"I mean, maybe I sort of like--"
01:52:29;01:52:35;"Like you told me about the guy who had addiction issues,"
01:52:35;01:52:38;"and he quit college at the peak of his ball playing career."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"Oh, right, right."
01:52:39;01:52:40;"And then he worked at--"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"like, you knew all that information."
01:52:41;01:52:44;"I think I just obtained that information that week."
01:52:44;01:52:45;"Right."
01:52:45;01:52:46;"I wish I followed the Dodgers."
01:52:46;01:52:47;"I just don't."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"Like, it just--"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"I'm always like, oh, yeah."
01:52:49;01:52:50;"This year I'll get into it again,"
01:52:50;01:52:51;"because I used to love baseball."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"It just hasn't happened."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"Did you follow the Stanley Cup a few weeks back?"
01:52:56;01:52:57;"Hell no."
01:52:57;01:52:59;"One of the teams is Las Vegas."
01:52:59;01:53:00;"Oh, really?"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"Yeah."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"There's a Vegas NHL team?"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"Wait, what are they called?"
01:53:03;01:53:04;"The Las Vegas Golden--"
01:53:04;01:53:06;"if I just came to you and said, Jake,"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"what level of hockey do you think the Las Vegas"
01:53:08;01:53:09;"Golden Knights play at?"
01:53:09;01:53:11;"You probably would've been like--"
01:53:11;01:53:13;"Yeah, whatever the minor league hockey is."
01:53:13;01:53:14;"Right."
01:53:14;01:53:16;"Anyway, Tony Romo, number nine."
01:53:16;01:53:18;"That's a gun."
01:53:18;01:53:20;"Post Malone is armed and dangerous."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"The number one song on the Rolling Stone list,"
01:53:22;01:53:25;"""Martha Reason the Vandellas,"" ""Dancing in the Street."""
01:53:28;01:53:28;"You know what's crazy?"
01:53:28;01:53:30;"I think the Dead covered this."
01:53:30;01:53:31;"Oh, yeah."
01:53:31;01:53:33;"Dancing, dancing in the street."
01:53:33;01:53:34;"Like, early Dead."
01:53:34;01:53:35;"'66, '67."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"That sounds more like a '70s."
01:53:36;01:53:37;"Really?"
01:53:37;01:53:42;"Well, maybe it is on a record in the '70s."
01:53:42;01:53:43;"Really?"
01:53:43;01:53:45;"This was on a studio album of theirs?"
01:53:45;01:53:52;"I haven't just-- all I've heard is really raw, like '67, '68,"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"'66."
01:53:54;01:53:56;"Really raw live recordings."
01:53:58;01:54:05;"Oh, they played it--"
01:54:05;01:54:07;"they played it at Cornell '77."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"Oh, really?"
01:54:08;01:54:10;"Don't they do this thing where they go, dancing, dancing?"
01:54:10;01:54:10;"Yeah."
01:54:17;01:54:31;"Oh, man, this is rough."
01:54:31;01:54:31;"[laughs]"
01:54:35;01:54:36;"That one sounds pretty good."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"Yeah."
01:54:43;01:54:51;"Maybe Richard Pictures should do this."
01:54:51;01:54:53;"That'd be fun."
01:54:53;01:54:54;"Dancing."
01:54:54;01:54:58;"We did a ""A Second That Emotion"" last time at the pub."
01:54:58;01:54:59;"Was there a Dead version of that?"
01:54:59;01:55:00;"Yeah."
01:55:00;01:55:01;"They did it a few times."

01:55:10;01:55:12;"dancing in the street."
01:55:12;01:55:12;"Great song."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Yeah."
01:55:13;01:55:14;"Exciting."
01:55:14;01:55:17;"Big drums for the '60s."
01:55:17;01:55:20;"The number one pick for the song of the summer by Billboard."
01:55:20;01:55:23;"So I guess this is the song of the summer, according to them."
01:55:23;01:55:25;"Drake, ""Nice For What."""

01:55:30;01:55:33;"I feel like this song is clearly not as big as God's plan."

01:55:34;01:55:35;"Is this--"
01:55:35;01:55:36;"Yeah, we did this on the top five before."
01:55:36;01:55:37;"Was it?"
01:55:37;01:55:38;"Yeah."
01:55:39;01:55:40;"(SINGING) Explain myself."
01:55:40;01:55:41;"Yeah."

01:55:46;01:55:47;"Is this a Kanye sample?"
01:55:47;01:55:48;"Right on the beat."
01:55:48;01:55:50;"No, Lauryn Hill."
01:55:50;01:55:51;"Oh."
01:55:51;01:55:51;"Did Kanye sample?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"He got a cut up too, you know?"
01:55:52;01:55:54;"He sampled a-- wait, that was a different Lauryn Hill"
01:55:54;01:55:55;"song he sampled back in the day."
01:55:55;01:55:56;"Yeah."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"OK, the same album."
01:55:58;01:55:59;"(SINGING) You said you'd pay for me."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"Give me the beat."
01:56:00;01:56:01;"Everybody get your--"
01:56:01;01:56:02;"Roll on."
01:56:02;01:56:04;"I don't show it and she doesn't want no slow song."
01:56:04;01:56:04;"That sounds pretty great."
01:56:04;01:56:06;"Had a man last year like Gozo."
01:56:06;01:56:07;"It's cool."
01:56:07;01:56:08;"Yeah."
01:56:08;01:56:09;"(SINGING) Had to let the thing loose, girl, it's so long."
01:56:09;01:56:10;"I just--"
01:56:10;01:56:10;"Oh, tempo."
01:56:10;01:56:11;"Oh, yeah."
01:56:11;01:56:13;"She don't like no slow songs."
01:56:13;01:56:14;"(SINGING) I don't care what she bringin' to the table."
01:56:14;01:56:18;"I usually think of Drake as like very kind of lethargic,"
01:56:18;01:56:19;"like, ballad."
01:56:19;01:56:21;"I think he's trying to get ahead of the curve."
01:56:21;01:56:26;"A lot of those other songs are kind of sad, quiet ones."
01:56:26;01:56:27;"(SINGING) And you're showin' up, but it's all right."
01:56:27;01:56:29;"And you're showin' up, but it's all right."
01:56:29;01:56:32;"Has that happened where just like someone like Drake"
01:56:32;01:56:35;"samples like a Kanye song from like two years ago?"
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Just like samples something of like Yeezus?"
01:56:37;01:56:40;"Well, there was the two Kanye albums ago."
01:56:40;01:56:43;"He had a whole song that sampled that Desiigner song, Panda,"
01:56:43;01:56:45;"which was brand new at the time."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"And Panda went on to be a big hit."
01:56:46;01:56:49;"But he kind of-- yes, it is."
01:56:49;01:56:51;"That happens."
01:56:51;01:56:53;"I remember there was a time-- this is like already a long time"
01:56:53;01:56:55;"ago, like mid-2000s."
01:56:55;01:56:57;"There was a time when there were like multiple songs"
01:56:57;01:57:00;"on the radio that had like Jay-Z samples on the hook."
01:57:00;01:57:03;"There's this-- bring 'em out, bring 'em out."
01:57:03;01:57:05;"Bring 'em out, bring 'em out."
01:57:05;01:57:06;"Remember that song?"
01:57:06;01:57:08;"No."
01:57:08;01:57:09;"But it was somebody else."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"That one was on the radio at that point."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"Really?"
01:57:13;01:57:14;"I don't think so."
01:57:14;01:57:18;"I remember like '02, when I was ordering pizza a lot."
01:57:18;01:57:20;"There was a period there, like a six month period,"
01:57:20;01:57:26;"where like Snoop was on like every other song."
01:57:26;01:57:28;"Right, because that was all the Dr. Dre stuff."
01:57:28;01:57:29;"And like-- I forget who else."
01:57:29;01:57:30;"Yeah."
01:57:30;01:57:32;"Well, those are the songs of the summer."
01:57:32;01:57:34;"I guess it's an interesting summer."
01:57:34;01:57:37;"I think that was a-- for 2018, that's a pretty good batch."
01:57:37;01:57:41;"I'm still going to go with Cardi B. It's just a fun song."
01:57:41;01:57:43;"A lot of these other summer songs are too depressing"
01:57:43;01:57:45;"or making you think too hard."
01:57:45;01:57:48;"Also, everybody's complaining all the time."
01:57:48;01:57:50;"What was your favorite from the Rolling Stone list?"
01:57:50;01:57:52;"""School's Out""?"
01:57:52;01:57:53;"Maybe the Eddie Cochran."
01:57:53;01:57:54;"I think I like ""Summertime Blues."""
01:57:54;01:57:55;"Yeah."
01:57:55;01:57:56;"And ""Dancing in the Street."""
01:57:56;01:57:58;"[vocalizing]"

01:58:30;01:58:33;"East Coast girls are whack."
01:58:33;01:58:34;"They think they're so whatever."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"Right."

01:58:39;01:58:43;"Midwestern girls spend too much time down on the farm."
01:58:43;01:58:47;"Northern girls, it's too cold to even do anything with."
01:58:47;01:58:48;"I wish they all could be California."
01:58:48;01:58:50;"I wish we could export California girls"
