00:00;00:07;">> Time crisis. The crisis crew is in New York. Ezra Koenig is warming up. I'm here"
00:07;00:12;"with Seinfeld. >> Hey, what's up?"
00:12;00:17;">> We're about to witness the most incredible show. Three sets, folks. Three sets."
00:17;00:22;">> But before we get into all that, Ezra's going to take us around the city to show us"
00:22;00:28;"some iconic locations before the show starts. And we're going to the Seinfeld Diner."
00:28;00:35;">> This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig. Beats for one."
00:35;00:42;">> One. >> One."
00:42;00:49;">> One."
00:56;01:03;">> What's up? Time Crisis back again. Very special, strange episode. We're going to"
01:03;01:10;"be sitting here, the whole Crisis crew, just about. At least the West Coast edition. Cousin"
01:31;01:36;"Astor's at a wedding. Despot might be coming. He's sitting here at Tom's Restaurant, aka"
01:36;01:42;"the Seinfeld Diner. But to me, it's the Columbia Diner. Now we're inside. It doesn't look like"
01:42;01:44;"Seinfeld, you know? The interior is totally different."
01:44;01:49;">> Yeah, it's shockingly different. >> But anyway, we're here. This is the weekend."
01:49;01:55;"Father of the Bride comes out, playing Webster Hall tomorrow. And we're waiting to order."
01:55;02:00;"And that's the tea. What's up, Jake? >> Not much. How are you? Congrats on the"
02:00;02:03;"album, by the way. >> Oh, thank you. You happy to be in New York?"
02:03;02:04;">> So-so. >> Well, the sun's out now."
02:04;02:09;">> Not a fan of the city. But I'm here for work. >> You to New York is like my dad to"
02:09;02:11;"California. >> Exactly."
02:11;02:14;">> Take it or leave it. >> Yeah. Had a fun time this morning with Nick."
02:14;02:18;"We walked around. >> What was your favorite part of what we saw"
02:18;02:20;"in New York? >> Shooting that Domino's. That was the highlight."
02:20;02:24;">> Got a tight shot of a local Domino's. >> Is that going to become a painting?"
02:24;02:27;">> Probably not. But maybe, you know. It'll go in the archives."
02:27;02:31;">> Do you feel good just as a Connecticut guy, just being a little, just that much closer"
02:31;02:34;"to the home state? >> Well, I think we've discussed this. I have"
02:34;02:37;"no love for CT or the East Coast. >> I thought, well, I know you have no-"
02:37;02:39;">> So I have no- >> I've never heard you quite put it that"
02:39;02:43;"way. I know you have no respect for CT as a musical homeland."
02:43;02:50;">> Well, I lived in Connecticut until I was 18, and now I'm 42. I don't have any sort"
02:50;02:53;"of sentimental attachment to Connecticut. >> Yeah."
02:53;02:57;">> You know, like the East Coast in the summer with, like, the maple trees, beautiful deciduous"
02:57;03:02;"forest. I can get down with it. It's gorgeous, but it doesn't, like, stir within me a yearning"
03:02;03:05;"for, like, childhood or, like, ancient memories. >> Yeah."
03:05;03:08;">> Because I feel like New Jersey's that way for you, where you, like-"
03:08;03:11;">> Well, and the whole East Coast. >> Right. You have, like, a visceral-"
03:11;03:14;">> Yeah. >> Emotional response to it."
03:14;03:17;">> That'd be a good song title, Deciduous Forest. It's a Jake song."
03:17;03:22;">> Let's write it. >> I've got respect for Deciduous Forest."
03:22;03:24;"No yearning. >> Oh, that's the title, No Yearning."
03:24;03:26;">> Yeah, No Yearning. >> That's the title."
03:26;03:32;">> No yearning for Deciduous Forest. >> Mad respect, but no love."
03:32;03:37;">> This is so- >> You know who else wrote a song in this"
03:37;03:38;"diner? >> In this diner?"
03:38;03:40;">> Oh, Susanne Vega. >> Susanne Vega."
03:40;03:42;">> Oh, really? >> See, like, when that song was, like, really"
03:42;03:59;"big in the '90s, do do do do do do do- >> Oh, okay."
03:59;04:00;">> Because this place is called Tom's Diner. That was, like, neck and neck with Seinfeld"
04:00;04:01;"for, like, the reference of this diner. >> Wait, sorry. I'm missing the Tom's connection."
04:01;04:02;">> I am sitting at Tom's Diner. >> Oh, really?"
04:02;04:03;">> Then something about Deciduous Forest, I don't remember the rest, but the song is called"
04:03;04:04;"Tom's Diner. You know that song, right? >> Yeah, I know the song."
04:04;04:06;">> It was acapella, and then- >> It's called Tom's Diner?"
04:06;04:08;">> Yeah. >> How did I miss that?"
04:08;04:11;">> Are you familiar with Susanne Vega? >> Yeah, sure. A little bit."
04:11;04:14;">> Is that the song Luca? >> I don't know the full catalog, but I know"
04:14;04:16;"that song. >> She's like a one-hit wonder, right?"
04:16;04:20;">> Whoa, whoa, whoa. >> Did she write that after Seinfeld was popular?"
04:20;04:23;">> No, no, no. No, it was before Seinfeld was popular."
04:23;04:25;">> So it was '80s then. >> It might have been-"
04:25;04:27;">> Concurrent. >> Seinfeld."
04:27;04:29;">> Yeah. >> Do you have your mobile rig with you?"
04:29;04:31;"Can we get a mobile number crunch here at Tom's Diner?"
04:31;04:36;">> Tom's Diner. 1982. >> Oh, it's early."
04:36;04:40;">> So that's six years before Seinfeld started. >> No, no, no. That song didn't come out in"
04:40;04:44;"1982. >> It was written in 1982. Oh, released in 1987."
04:44;04:47;"Wikipedia, what are you doing? >> Yeah, good luck."
04:47;04:50;">> Oh, so it came out a year- >> And then when did the DNA remix?"
04:50;04:53;"That's the popular version. Because their original version is straight-up acapella,"
04:53;04:57;"so it was perfect for remixers. When did that come out?"
04:57;05:04;">> '88, which is a year before Seinfeld. >> Yeah, so Susanne Vega really put this"
05:04;05:07;"place on the map a little bit. I think she lived up here."
05:07;05:12;"Did she go to Columbia or something? >> Oh, she went to nearby Barnard College."
05:12;05:15;"Do you know Barnard College? >> Yeah, heard of it."
05:15;05:19;">> Private women's liberal college. >> I mean, I have conflicted feelings about"
05:19;05:24;"Columbia, because on the one hand, who cares? But on the other hand, yes, Seinfeld."
05:24;05:27;"Barnard is a part of Columbia University. >> Oh, it is?"
05:27;05:30;">> Yeah, it's an all-women's college. Oh, now it's time to order."
05:30;05:32;"Yeah, we can order. >> We're ready to order."
06:01;06:21;"[singing]"
06:21;06:24;">> Excuse me? >> Oh, yeah, do you sell the T-shirts that everybody's wearing?"
06:24;06:27;"Yeah, nice. Okay. >> You're going to pick one of those up?"
06:27;06:32;">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> At restaurants that sell merch, it seems like really funny"
06:32;06:38;"to order it from the waiter or waitress. But also, it seems weird to have to--"
06:38;06:40;"you're paying-- >> Separate transaction."
06:40;06:45;">> Yeah, then you got to go to the counter. Just like, ""Thank you. I'll get a cheeseburger,"
06:45;06:51;"a side of fries, the long-sleeved Tom's Diner wrapped tea, and one white dad hat."""
06:51;06:54;">> A round of dad hats for the crew. For the table."
06:54;07:01;">> Do you have any specials today? Oh, yeah, we have the new Kith Nike Seinfeld Air Max 98s."
07:01;07:06;"Okay, cool. I'll take that. Just so you know, sir, it's $450. Fine."
07:06;07:08;">> Oh, and a coffee. >> Oh, and a coffee."
07:08;07:12;">> Side of cottage cheese. >> I think that'll happen in our lifetime,"
07:12;07:15;"some, like, Hypebeast's restaurant. >> I think you're giving Supreme some ideas."
07:15;07:18;">> Oh, yeah, that'll probably happen. Supreme will just open a restaurant,"
07:18;07:21;"maybe only for, like, a week or something. Wait, what about this?"
07:21;07:25;"The Supreme restaurant with no food. But you have to still come. You have to wait in line."
07:25;07:28;"Like a pop-in restaurant. Then you got to sit down at the booth."
07:28;07:33;"Then the waiter comes over, gives you nothing, no water, and then you say, ""Can I take your order?"""
07:33;07:35;">> Can you make a reservation? >> Do you pay?"
07:35;07:38;">> First come, first serve. Yeah, no, you pay. They bring you a check and everything."
07:38;07:42;"But I think also he'll-- you know that there's going to be certain things ahead of time."
07:42;07:45;"They'll do, like, a public menu. But then he'll come around, like, at an Italian restaurant"
07:45;07:50;"with, like, the special board. And then you'll be like, ""Oh, holy s--t. They got that grill?"""
07:50;07:53;"And he's like, ""For $1,500, I'll take it."""
07:53;07:56;"Then they bring it for you and it to go, bag, and then you leave."
07:56;07:59;">> We got to do this for TC merch. >> Okay."
07:59;08:01;">> F--k Supreme. >> Yeah, actually, Supreme, you can't have that idea."
08:01;08:02;">> You hear that?"
08:02;08:06;">> Well, it's a nice day in New York. The sun's coming out. It was rainy this morning."
08:06;08:11;"Oh, you know, we can go horse around late. We should go see my tag."
08:11;08:13;">> Your what? >> I think the statute of limitations has passed."
08:13;08:17;"I used to be kind of scared to talk about it. You know, like, Banksy?"
08:17;08:19;">> Sure. >> I used to be, like, that kind of guy."
08:19;08:22;"I was doing street art, graffiti, things of that nature."
08:22;08:25;">> With, like, cultural commentary? >> So it was, like, sophomore year of college?"
08:25;08:27;">> Yeah. >> What kind of statements were you making?"
08:27;08:31;">> I don't even know if Banksy was out yet. When Banksy come out-- he came out, like, what, a couple years ago?"
08:31;08:33;"[laughter]"
08:33;08:36;">> 2014. >> Your stuff was, like, proto-Banksy."
08:36;08:40;">> Yeah. I feel like Banksy came out around the same time as Lorde, if I remember correctly."
08:40;08:43;">> Came out. >> Because it was the summer. You heard Royals everywhere."
08:43;08:48;"Everybody shut up about Banksy. So, yeah, before him, I was doing street art."
08:48;08:51;"I was tagging s*** up. >> You're a real innovator."
08:51;08:54;">> I was using a spray can to paint a bike, and I said, ""I could use this for art."""
08:54;09:02;"So I made stencils for maybe, like, a month, and my little stencil was a Lacoste alligator,"
09:02;09:05;"which at the time-- >> Wow. >> I thought was kind of novel."
09:05;09:10;"It was, like, a little before this current wave of, like, huge Lacoste alligators and stuff,"
09:10;09:15;"and everything is branded to the extreme. I thought I was being somewhat creative."
09:15;09:19;"I mean, about 20,000 other people had similar ideas, but I don't know."
09:19;09:23;"I feel, like, a little weird about it, but I hope the statute of limitations is passed."
09:23;09:28;"Otherwise--and I think it's cool, honestly, but for a long time, they were doing construction"
09:28;09:32;"outside my room in my dorm. So, you know, already, I'm living with that."
09:32;09:35;">> That sounds terrible. >> Yeah. >> But they start at, like, 7 in the morning."
09:35;09:39;">> So basically, right outside of my window was, like, this giant scaffolding."
09:39;09:44;"So I realized, like, I suddenly had, like, a balcony. As I think back, it was probably kind of dangerous."
09:44;09:49;"I could just open my window. And, like, sometimes I'd just be, like, in my bed, just, like, see, like, the dudes working."
09:49;09:53;"Like, eye contact. >> Oh. >> And so-- >> Eye contact. >> So one time they weren't there,"
09:53;09:56;"and I opened the window, and I, like, went out onto the scaffolding. >> Yeah."
09:56;10:01;">> And I was, like, wow. When they're not working, it's, like, kind of like a chill little balcony I got here."
10:01;10:05;">> What floor were you on? >> It wasn't high. Second. >> Okay."
10:05;10:08;">> Was it stable? >> What? >> Was it stable? Was it safe?"
10:08;10:12;">> It was very unsafe. No, I think--I don't know. >> Well, they were working on it."
10:12;10:16;">> I'm pretty risk-averse when it comes to heights and stuff."
10:16;10:21;"Maybe because I was, like, on the scaffolding, I didn't really feel like I was tagging the building."
10:21;10:23;"I was, like, cloistered from the rest of the building."
10:23;10:27;"So then I was, like, oh, let me try my stencil. So I just did it on the ledge."
10:27;10:32;"And then the scaffolding's up forever. Then eventually they take it down, and I kind of look, and there's just, like, this--"
10:32;10:37;"it's pretty subtle. Just this small, black, Lacoste alligator on the building."
10:37;10:43;"And in years past, I would go check, and it was still there almost ten years later."
10:43;10:45;"So maybe we should go check now. >> Love it."
10:45;10:49;">> What are they going to do? Take away my diploma? [bleep] you, Columbia."
10:49;10:53;">> You know how Banksy art gets, like, chiseled out of walls and stuff and, like, put into museums and stuff?"
10:53;10:57;">> Oh, yeah. >> I feel like now that this is public, there's a very high risk--"
10:57;11:00;">> I feel like I've said this before. >> Okay. >> Although, as of me--"
11:00;11:03;">> News to me. It's news to you guys? >> Yeah, I hadn't heard it."
11:03;11:10;">> You know, there's that famous Beastie Boys tag on the top of the Capitol Records building?"
11:10;11:13;">> Oh, yeah, I've seen that. >> I feel like this is like that."
11:13;11:16;">> Yeah, if I was Columbia, I'd put a plaque next to it."
11:16;11:19;">> Is it visible from the street? Like, can we check it out?"
11:19;11:22;">> Yeah, yeah, we should go check it out after this. Okay, but here comes the food, so--"
11:22;11:24;">> Here comes the food. All right. We should check back in?"
11:24;11:27;">> Yeah, yeah, so let's take a break, and here's ""Lord with Royals."""

12:36;12:38;"So we left Tom's Diner."
12:38;12:41;"Now we're standing in front of my old dorm, Ruggles."
12:41;12:44;"Jake, I remember you visited me in this dorm back in the day."
12:44;12:45;"That's tight."
12:45;12:47;"Did we tell this story on Tom's Basis?"
12:47;12:48;"I think we did."
12:48;12:53;"This is just like a weird memory I have, is that the dorm, I think true at most colleges,"
12:53;12:57;"there's a security guard, so you have to sign in non-students."
12:57;13:00;"So Jake came to visit me, so I came down to sign him in,"
13:00;13:04;"and I remember the security guard looked at your name, and she said,"
13:04;13:07;"""Longstretch, huh?"""
13:07;13:08;"And you were like, ""Yeah?"""
13:08;13:09;"And she goes--"
13:09;13:10;"Longstreath, ma'am."
13:10;13:14;"And then she chuckled to herself and said, ""I'm sorry, I'm just perverted."""
13:14;13:17;"And I was--I remember at the time, I've always thought about that,"
13:17;13:19;"just kind of like, I kind of get it."
13:19;13:23;"I mean, there's a lot of names that sound a lot pervier than Longstreath."
13:23;13:26;"But there's something about--she said, ""Longstretch, I'm perverted."""
13:26;13:30;"And I was like, whatever I'm picturing is not very sexy, but most people say,"
13:30;13:32;"""Longstretch."""
13:32;13:35;"Yeah, like a very stretched-out male member."
13:35;13:36;"Is that what she's referring to?"
13:36;13:37;"Yeah."
13:37;13:41;"Anyway, so now we're standing in front, and my little tag is still there."
13:41;13:43;"I also think it kind of suits it."
13:43;13:44;"It's tasteful."
13:44;13:46;"It's survived 13, 14 years now."
13:46;13:48;"And then it's specific to the LaCoste logo."
13:48;13:50;"It's not just like a crocodile."
13:50;13:51;"It's like you're--"
13:51;13:52;"Yeah, that was my take."
13:52;13:56;"You were like, ""I'm going to tag the LaCoste logo around campus."""
13:56;13:58;"Seemed like a good idea at the time."
13:58;13:59;"What year?"
13:59;14:00;"'05 or '06."
14:00;14:02;"I wonder how buzzed about this is."
14:02;14:04;"Do people know this as a small landmark?"
14:04;14:06;"I feel like I've talked about it before."
14:06;14:08;"I have memories of standing in front of this same place with a journalist"
14:08;14:11;"or something, but I haven't been up here in such a long time."
14:11;14:12;"But I think it's tasteful."
14:12;14:14;"I think most people just don't notice."
14:14;14:18;"But anyway, they didn't compensate me for disrupting my education"
14:18;14:23;"with the noisy construction happening, so I think it's fair."
14:23;14:25;"I feel like you should update it in some way."
14:25;14:28;"If you could go back and add a hoverboard or something."
14:28;14:29;"The Harmony Hall snake?"
14:29;14:30;"Yeah."
14:30;14:33;"Well, I feel also like--I think when I was doing that,"
14:33;14:36;"the commonality or the commonness--I don't know what the word--"
14:36;14:40;"yeah, commonness of people just doing stencils to promote an album"
14:40;14:43;"on the sidewalk, it wasn't quite happening yet."
14:43;14:46;"Because now I look at this and I'm like, it seems a little like"
14:46;14:49;"a viral marketing campaign now, whereas at the time, you know,"
14:49;14:51;"I felt like I was like proto-Banksy."
14:51;14:53;"Or like a shepherd fairy."
14:53;14:54;"Yeah, maybe a little shepherd fairy."
14:54;14:56;"Like the Obey stickers with Andre."
14:56;15:00;"Just for the record, you're not Banksy, right?"
15:00;15:03;"Well, I mean, I did this tag in 2005."
15:03;15:05;"Banksy didn't come out until--what did we say?"
15:05;15:10;"Oh, yeah, 2013 when Royals came out by Lorde, so who's to say?"
15:10;15:12;"He's had a pretty short career, actually."
15:12;15:15;"Yeah, he knows how to make a splash."
15:15;15:18;"He's been everywhere for the past six years, but it's interesting"
15:18;15:23;"when you think what was going on between my first tag and that summer at 13."
15:23;15:24;"I don't know."
15:24;15:26;"He did some great work on that Lorde campaign."
15:26;15:28;"Yeah."
15:28;15:31;"Just for color, we are like on the move right now,"
15:31;15:35;"walking across the street, dodging cars and stuff."
15:35;15:37;"Hey, how's it going?"
15:37;15:40;"Yeah, sure."
15:40;15:42;"Oh, that's cool."
15:42;15:45;"That's all good."
15:45;15:46;"Yeah?"
15:46;15:47;"Sure."
15:47;15:48;"Oh, you're writing theses?"
15:48;15:52;"Hold the mic."
15:52;15:53;"Can I hold the mic?"
15:53;15:55;"Do you listen to Time Crisis?"
15:55;15:56;"Billy on the Street."
15:56;15:57;"Yes."
15:57;15:58;"Oh, awesome."
15:58;15:59;"Nice to meet you guys."
15:59;16:01;"Good luck with your theses."
16:01;16:02;"I'm so sorry to interrupt."
16:02;16:04;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
16:04;16:05;"Amazing."
16:05;16:06;"Nice to meet you."
16:06;16:07;"I love the new album."
16:07;16:08;"Oh, thank you."
16:08;16:09;"Thanks so much."
16:09;16:10;"I love the new album."
16:10;16:11;"I love the new stuff."
16:11;16:13;"I remember life as a stranger."
16:13;16:15;"I should put out my own version."
16:15;16:18;"Jake, live at Columbia University."
16:18;16:23;"You know who played at Columbia University in the late '60s when my dad went here?"
16:23;16:24;"Dead?"
16:24;16:25;"The dead."
16:25;16:26;"Hell, yeah."
16:26;16:27;"Is this all the graduation stuff?"
16:27;16:28;"This is the graduation set up."
16:28;16:29;"Oh, wow."
16:29;16:31;"You can't really see the campus as well because they put up all these tents."
16:31;16:33;"Oh, I've never been to this part of the campus."
16:33;16:35;"Well, yeah, see, you walk on here and it's like a real campus now."
16:35;16:36;"Right."
16:36;16:37;"And they film part of Ghostbusters here."
16:37;16:38;"Oh, yeah."
16:38;16:39;"And Spider-Man."
16:39;16:40;"Which part?"
16:40;16:42;"Sort of the beginning when they're launching the whole business."
16:42;16:43;"Oh, got it."
16:43;16:44;"Okay."
16:44;16:47;"Like this is where whoever plays Harold Ramis' office is here or something?"
16:47;16:48;"Right."
16:48;16:49;"Oh, no, I think Ackroyd."
16:49;16:50;"Yeah."
16:50;16:51;"No, no."
16:51;16:52;"No, it's Bill Murray."
16:52;16:53;"Yeah, Bill Murray."
16:53;16:54;"Peter Venkman has an office."
16:54;16:55;"Come on, Jake."
16:55;16:56;"Well, yeah, so it's a big campus."
16:56;16:59;"Oh, yeah, but I think it might have been '68 or '69."
16:59;17:02;"The dead played outdoors on campus."
17:02;17:03;"That's awesome."
17:03;17:05;"How guerrilla do you think it was?"
17:05;17:11;"By the looks of the pictures, it kind of looks like a -- yeah, like rolled up on a truck or something."
17:11;17:12;"Flatbed truck."
17:12;17:13;"Yeah."
17:13;17:18;"But those are also the days when they're like students were taking over buildings and that kind of thing."
17:18;17:19;"Did your dad see the show?"
17:19;17:22;"No, I think he said like he kind of heard it and was like --"
17:22;17:23;"Not for me."
17:23;17:24;"Yeah."
17:24;17:25;"Where are the songs, man?"
17:25;17:28;"You know, this is pre-Working Man's Dead, so."
17:28;17:29;"Pre-American Beauty."
17:29;17:37;"I went down one day."
17:37;17:52;"I went down to see a gentlewoman just one old day, yes, a day."
17:52;17:58;"I want to find out, I want to find out, I want to find out now."
17:58;18:07;"What's wrong with me and my baby?"
18:07;18:16;"We ain't been getting down like we used to do."
18:16;18:22;"I mean, it's pretty good now."
18:22;18:39;"But there was a time when it didn't work too well."
18:39;18:47;"I went down to see this gypsy woman, you understand."

19:37;19:43;"- For your big spring concerts when you were here,"
19:43;19:47;"remember who played anything memorable?"
19:47;19:49;"- I remember one of the big spring concerts"
19:49;19:51;"was an early Kanye performance."
19:51;19:52;"- Wow."
19:52;19:54;"- So they would set up a big stage right there."
19:54;19:56;"And then we later came and played one"
19:56;20:00;"and the bill was the Clips and Vampire Weekend."
20:00;20:02;"- That's a strong COVID line."
20:02;20:04;"- Shout out to any Columbia students"
20:04;20:06;"who caught that one and done bill."
20:06;20:08;"- I remember Lewis and Clark College,"

20:12;20:14;"- The original line up of the Korean boy band BTS."
20:14;20:18;"- The original BTS played in like '98, '99."
20:18;20:20;"- Yeah, that was a different line up."
20:20;20:20;"- Different line up."
20:20;20:21;"- They got some young guys in now."
20:21;20:24;"They're pretty good, but it's not the same as the--"
20:24;20:26;"- There's no original members of, anymore."
20:26;20:28;"- Yeah, the interesting thing,"
20:28;20:30;"people talk about BTS as being K-pop,"
20:30;20:32;"but the original line up was actually"
20:32;20:34;"a bunch of American dudes from Idaho."
20:34;20:35;"And then just over the years,"
20:35;20:38;"operations started moving to Korea,"
20:38;20:40;"started swapping people out one by one."
20:40;20:41;"And the next thing you know,"
20:41;20:43;"it's all 24 year old guys from Korea."
20:43;20:46;"But honestly, I like to see that kind of evolution"
20:46;20:47;"in a group."
20:47;20:50;"They ditched the guitars, they started dancing."
20:50;20:51;"- They've maintained the brand."
20:51;20:53;"- Yeah, anyway, so shout out to Built to Spill"

21:38;21:40;"- When was the last time you were back actually on campus?"
21:40;21:44;"- I have this memory of a couple years ago,"
21:44;21:47;"like me and Rashida were uptown and we took a walk,"
21:47;21:49;"showed her my haunts, like,"
21:49;21:51;"oh, I got a bagel there once, that kind of thing."
21:51;21:52;"(laughing)"
21:52;21:53;"- Once. - You know?"
21:53;21:56;"It's a beautiful day though, the sun really came out."
21:56;22:00;"Oh yeah, I see some of the kids in their graduation gowns."
22:00;22:04;"♪ Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet ♪"
22:04;22:07;"- You think Columbia will ask you to give a commencement?"
22:07;22:09;"- That doesn't seem up my alley."
22:09;22:09;"- Would you say no?"
22:09;22:11;"- I think you'd be great at it though."
22:11;22:13;"- I gave a speech at my high school graduation."
22:13;22:15;"I was the class speaker."
22:15;22:17;"And I thought-- - What year?"
22:17;22:18;"- That was '02."
22:18;22:19;"- Oh, like when you graduated."
22:19;22:20;"- When I graduated, yeah."
22:20;22:23;"I feel like Columbia,"
22:23;22:24;"no, because my instinct would be to get up there"
22:24;22:26;"and kind of like roast Columbia."
22:26;22:28;"- Sure."
22:28;22:30;"College is pointless, it's overpriced."
22:30;22:31;"- And I went once with,"
22:31;22:35;"I went with Rashida when she spoke at Harvard."
22:35;22:36;"And I met, there was some really nice kids"
22:36;22:37;"who were like part of the thing."
22:37;22:39;"I was like sitting there and I was like,"
22:39;22:41;"I don't know if this is a good vibe."
22:41;22:43;"- Do you remember who gave your commencement speech?"
22:43;22:46;"- Oh yeah, Senator John McCain, rest in peace."
22:46;22:49;"Well, his daughter Megan was the same year as me."
22:49;22:50;"We didn't really know each other,"
22:50;22:53;"but I remember seeing them walk around once or twice."
22:53;22:56;"So McCain gave a speech, I'm pretty sure,"
22:56;22:59;"I feel like one of the student organizations"
22:59;23:02;"passed out like some kind of protest buttons."
23:02;23:05;"I think I wore one, but you know, it's funny,"
23:05;23:07;"just the other day, I can't even remember how this came up."
23:07;23:09;"Me and Bayo were joking about,"
23:09;23:12;"we were talking about the last time Tool had an album out"
23:12;23:14;"and he was like, it was '06, it was May '06."
23:14;23:16;"So then I just, for whatever reason,"
23:16;23:17;"I didn't know that album."
23:17;23:19;"I mean, I like Tool, but I don't really know that album."
23:19;23:21;"So I was like, that's like right when I graduated college."
23:21;23:23;"I mean, you're older than Bayo."
23:23;23:26;"And then it became this extended fantasy"
23:26;23:29;"of just me wearing my blue graduation gown and cap,"
23:29;23:31;"rocking a Sony Walkman,"
23:31;23:34;"just blasting the new Tool album"
23:34;23:36;"while I'm waiting in line to get my diploma."
23:36;23:38;"And I feel like this probably happened a lot in the '80s,"
23:38;23:39;"maybe in the '90s a little bit,"
23:39;23:42;"just like walking up to the president of Columbia,"
23:42;23:43;"it's like there to shake my hand."
23:43;23:45;"And like in front of everybody, I pull one ear off"
23:45;23:46;"and I'm just like, what'd you say?"
23:46;23:47;"Ha, sorry man, just listening to the new Tool."
23:47;23:50;"Hey, thanks a lot, Prez, appreciate it."
23:50;23:51;"Later losers."
23:51;23:55;"I'm gonna start telling that story in interviews"
23:55;23:56;"as if it's true."
23:56;23:57;"Anytime anybody's like, got any good Columbia stories,"
23:57;23:59;"I'll be like, you know, it's funny,"
23:59;24:01;"right when Vampire Weekend started,"
24:01;24:03;"couple months later, graduate,"
24:03;24:05;"as you know, the new Tool album came out that month"
24:05;24:07;"and I just couldn't stop listening to it."
24:07;24:09;"So here I am at my graduation,"
24:09;24:11;"just (beep) glued to this thing, man."
24:11;24:12;"And I walk up on stage and I got the headphone,"
24:12;24:14;"yeah, I'm gonna start telling that as if it's fact."
24:14;24:17;"- Do you think Megan caught any early VW shows?"
24:17;24:18;"- I don't know."
24:18;24:20;"As you can imagine, I've made disagreements"
24:20;24:22;"with her politically."
24:22;24:22;"- Sure. - And one time,"
24:22;24:24;"she said some kind of wild (beep) on Twitter"
24:24;24:26;"and I said something and I--"
24:26;24:27;"- About me? - Yeah."
24:27;24:28;"- Or just, you said something--"
24:28;24:29;"- No, not about Vampire Weekend."
24:29;24:29;"- About like the world at large?"
24:29;24:33;"- Yeah, just wild stuff about Israel."
24:33;24:34;"- Oh, like all that recent garbage?"
24:34;24:35;"- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
24:35;24:37;"- And I don't know her, I don't know why,"
24:37;24:39;"maybe just 'cause, you know,"
24:39;24:41;"you see someone walking down the street with your dad,"
24:41;24:43;"with their dad, you kind of feel like,"
24:43;24:45;"oh yeah, they seem like a normal person,"
24:45;24:47;"so you know, you hope somewhere in there,"
24:47;24:50;"there's some understanding, but who knows,"
24:50;24:52;"you get very different politics."
24:52;24:54;"So anyway, after I kind of like clapped back,"
24:54;24:56;"I wasn't trying to be mean, but I just had to,"
24:56;24:58;"it was just wild, I felt like I had to say something."
24:58;25:01;"Then a few people sent me some old tweets of hers"
25:01;25:03;"where she was like, ""Vampire Weekend, what a cool band,"""
25:03;25:04;"and they went to Columbia."
25:04;25:07;"And I was like, well, at least you got good taste in music,"
25:07;25:08;"that's all I can say."
25:08;25:12;"- I mean, someone sent this to me recently,"
25:12;25:16;"a photograph of Neil Young hanging out with Trump in 2014."
25:16;25:18;"- Whoa, oh yeah, and what's that about?"
25:18;25:20;"- Maybe Neil was there talking to Trump about Pono,"
25:20;25:21;"but basically-- - Oh God."
25:21;25:22;"- I'm kind of joking about the Pono thing."
25:22;25:24;"- Yeah, no, it's truly, that could be real."
25:24;25:25;"- But Donald was just like,"
25:25;25:27;"""Neil Young, one of my favorite musicians."""
25:27;25:29;"- Oh yeah. - And just like, all right."
25:29;25:30;"- Well, and remember-- - You also can hear him"
25:30;25:32;"saying that literally about anybody he meets."
25:32;25:33;"- And then Don, that's true."
25:33;25:35;"And then there's a picture of Don Jr., I think,"
25:35;25:38;"with a Grateful Dead poster in his childhood bedroom."
25:38;25:40;"- I love that, I love that image."
25:40;25:41;"I use that to promote a Richard picture."
25:41;25:42;"- Oh, really? - I should do that again."
25:42;25:45;"- I wonder if there was ever a discussion just like,"
25:45;25:50;"Trump, Don Jr., just blasting some dead,"
25:50;25:53;"and then Trump coming in, ""What is this, Neil Young?"
25:53;25:54;"""No, no, no, Dad, this is the dead."
25:54;25:55;"""Oh, I don't like them."
25:55;25:57;"""Love Neil Young, incredible artist."""
25:57;26:00;"I wonder if Trump could name one Neil Young song."
26:00;26:01;"- Yeah. - Although as discussed--"
26:01;26:03;"- Heart of Gold, Old Man?"
26:03;26:04;"That'd be fascinating. - He just seems so like,"
26:04;26:06;"he just seems like such a weirdo."
26:06;26:08;"The idea that he could actually recall something like that."
26:08;26:10;"- Right, right, I know what you mean."
26:10;26:12;"- I'm not saying that he hasn't listened to Neil Young,"
26:12;26:14;"but the one interesting thing about him,"
26:14;26:16;"given that he's such a monster,"
26:16;26:18;"this has come up in a few discussions over the years."
26:18;26:21;"So, you know, obviously, everything the guy says,"
26:21;26:25;"horrible, just narcissistic garbage,"
26:25;26:29;"and then infamously, when Ali G was trying to punk him,"
26:29;26:32;"back on the old Ali G show, he was doing a fake bit"
26:32;26:33;"where he was trying to get Trump to invest"
26:33;26:35;"in his ice cream glove company."
26:35;26:38;"It's a glove to cover your hands when you eat ice cream."
26:38;26:39;"So he's like pitching him, he goes,"
26:39;26:44;"""Yo, what is the one thing everyone in the world loves?"""
26:44;26:46;"And Trump, like quick, goes, ""Music."""
26:46;26:48;"And then Ali G goes, ""No, no, no, ice cream."""
26:48;26:49;"And then whatever."
26:49;26:50;"But I was always kind of like--"
26:50;26:51;"- Wow. - You know what I mean?"
26:51;26:52;"Just like-- - Yeah, like,"
26:52;26:54;"what did he even mind specifically?"
26:54;26:58;"- And also, just like Trump being such a selfish dude,"
26:58;27:02;"it would seem off-brand for Trump to be like, ""Music."""
27:02;27:04;"It's just like a kind vibe thing to say."
27:04;27:06;"Maybe he meant more from a market research point of view."
27:06;27:08;"- Yeah, you'd think he'd be like, ""Diamonds."""
27:08;27:10;"- Yeah. - Right."
27:10;27:11;"- ""Gold."" - Yeah."
27:11;27:12;"- ""Real estate investments."""
27:12;27:14;"""The band KISS."""
27:14;27:16;"(laughing)"
27:16;27:17;"- Well, thanks for hanging out with us today."
27:17;27:19;"It's been an interesting day."
27:19;27:23;"Seinfeld Diner, hanging around Columbia."
27:23;27:25;"Love just at the end of the day, it's like,"
27:25;27:28;"we're just like standing on the Columbia campus outdoors,"
27:28;27:30;"just talking like Trump and KISS."
27:30;27:31;"It's just kind of like, one way or another,"
27:31;27:34;"just wherever you are, you know."
27:34;27:35;"The more things change, the more they stay the same,"
27:35;27:37;"I guess is what I'm saying."
27:37;27:41;"Anyway, we're gonna wrap it up, go to a new neighborhood,"
27:41;27:43;"and we'll check back in tomorrow"
27:43;27:45;"when you guys will be on the ground"

28:44;28:46;"we were at the Seinfeld Diner,"
28:46;28:49;"and now we're actually just kinda heading into Webster Hall."
28:49;28:53;"We just got in, and the line was a little gnarly, right?"

34:30;34:31;"Do you wanna introduce?"
34:31;34:33;"- Hi, I'm Brandon Wardell."
34:33;34:34;"- Friend of the show."
34:34;34:35;"- Friend of the show, friend of the pod."
34:35;34:37;"Well, it's not a pod."
34:37;34:38;"- Friend of the internet radio program."
34:38;34:41;"- Friend of the internet radio program."
34:41;34:43;"- I'm Jaboukie Young-White."
34:43;34:46;"- Brendan O'Hare, O apostrophe H-A-R-E."
34:46;34:48;"- So what did you guys think of this first time"
34:48;34:50;"like just you know, candid thoughts,"
34:50;34:55;"you can criticize it as raw as you want here."
34:55;34:57;"- I thought it was a lovely set."
34:57;34:58;"I thought they really ripped it up."
34:58;35:00;"Music is just a wonderful thing."
35:00;35:01;"I love listening to it."
35:01;35:05;"And I'm excited to hear 12 more hours of it today."
35:05;35:06;"- Yeah, I've heard all those songs before"
35:06;35:08;"and I wish that they had done songs"
35:08;35:09;"I'd never heard before."
35:09;35:10;"No, I'm kidding."
35:10;35:13;"I actually missed the set."
35:13;35:14;"- You've been actually, you've been kinda,"
35:14;35:16;"I've seen some spicy tweets from you"
35:16;35:19;"about like Seinfeld 2000 or Vampire Weekend."
35:19;35:20;"- I was like--"
35:20;35:21;"- I'm sorry, no, no, no."
35:21;35:22;"About the band, right?"
35:22;35:24;"Like some of the political ramifications"
35:24;35:28;"of like what it means to be a fan of this band in 2019."
35:28;35:30;"Can you like expand on that at all?"
35:30;35:33;"- The political ramifications of being a fan of this,"
35:33;35:37;"I mean, you know, listening to Vampire Weekend,"
35:37;35:40;"you do sort of go up in the social strata"
35:40;35:43;"the more that you listen to it, right?"
35:43;35:45;"I actually have to pay more taxes this year"
35:45;35:49;"because I listened to Vampire Weekend too much in 2018."
35:49;35:52;"- Would you say it's a little bit revolutionary"
35:52;35:53;"to be a fan of this band?"
35:53;35:56;"- I would, I would, no, I would say it's revolutionary"
35:56;36:01;"to be a fan of this band and to not be a fan of this band."
36:01;36:03;"For me, at this point, I feel like I would kind of"
36:03;36:07;"be a class traitor to not be a fan of Vampire Weekend."
36:07;36:10;"- Randy, you got your own podcast happening."
36:10;36:13;"Has it started already or?"
36:13;36:15;"- It's going to start this Wednesday."
36:15;36:17;"This is Branchburg with me and Corey Snorowski."
36:17;36:20;"Tim Heidecker is producing it."
36:20;36:22;"He's a friend of the show, Tim Heidecker,"
36:22;36:23;"so yeah, I think it'll be a good time"
36:23;36:26;"if you listen in, Apple Podcasts."
36:26;36:27;"- What's it all about?"
36:27;36:31;"- So it is about a group of characters, monologues,"
36:31;36:33;"sketches, all that type of thing,"
36:33;36:37;"located in a small town called Branchburg, New Jersey,"
36:37;36:39;"and it's all pre-scripted."
36:39;36:41;"Episodes are about 15 minutes long every Wednesday,"
36:41;36:44;"so it's quick if you want a nice commute"
36:44;36:45;"little thing to listen to,"
36:45;36:47;"you want to listen to something at dinner,"
36:47;36:48;"it's a perfect thing."
36:48;36:50;"- Is it made for dinner?"
36:50;36:51;"- It's made for dinner."
36:51;36:53;"Lunch, no, dinner, yes."
36:53;36:55;"- Is it a podcast or a suppertime?"
36:55;36:58;"This band loves suppertime podcasts."

43:13;43:14;"I'm here with Seinfeld."
43:14;43:15;"- What's up?"
43:15;43:20;"- The Crisis Crew and Billions creator, Brian Koppelman."
43:20;43:22;"- I'm so thrilled to be here, but on Time Crisis,"
43:22;43:23;"a co-creator along with Dave Levine,"
43:23;43:27;"but on Time Crisis, I have to say Anna Koppelman's dad,"
43:27;43:30;"because she is your most dedicated and loyal listener."
43:30;43:33;"You've read her letter on the air."
43:33;43:34;"So I have to shout out to Anna,"
43:34;43:36;"and I'm not gonna tell her that I did this."
43:36;43:37;"So she's just gonna, you're hearing it now."
43:37;43:40;"Sorry, boo, that I didn't tell you before."
43:40;43:41;"- Do you guys listen to the show together?"
43:41;43:44;"Is this like a family bonding experience?"
43:44;43:47;"- Anna and Sam, her brother, her older brother, my son,"
43:47;43:49;"they listen really religiously."
43:49;43:52;"Even Anna's at college and Sam's out of college,"
43:52;43:53;"they'll call each other during the show."
43:53;43:55;"They're way into it."
43:55;43:57;"And I listen when I'm sort of permitted to,"
43:57;44:00;"or I'm part of it somehow."
44:00;44:01;"- What'd you think of set one?"
44:01;44:04;"- Now, I'm a huge vampire, I mean, I love Vampire Weekend."
44:04;44:06;"I love the set."
44:06;44:08;"First of all, the cover songs,"
44:08;44:10;"it was like they were playing them for me."
44:10;44:13;"Joker Man is one of my all-time favorite Dylan songs."
44:13;44:16;"It's what got me, and if you've watched the show,"
44:16;44:17;"you know that we use a Dylan song,"
44:17;44:19;"and I know you guys watch the show."
44:19;44:21;"We use a Dylan song every season."
44:21;44:23;"He's the one artist that no matter what,"
44:23;44:25;"we use to close out an episode."
44:25;44:27;"This year we used World Gone Wrong."
44:27;44:31;"But Infidels is one of, it's basically the Dylan album"
44:31;44:33;"that I listened to first to get into Dylan"
44:33;44:35;"when I was a freshman in college."
44:35;44:36;"And then I went backwards from there."
44:36;44:41;"So hearing it played as a close out to the first set,"
44:41;44:44;"the last song, was really amazing to me."
44:44;44:48;"- Yeah, how tough is it to get a Dylan song for a TV show?"
44:48;44:50;"Like, how does that even work?"
44:50;44:51;"- Not that hard, depending,"
44:51;44:56;"I used some songs of Bob's in movies."
44:56;44:59;"And I think after the first season,"
44:59;45:02;"when people understood the way we used music,"
45:02;45:05;"artists seemed pretty willing to give us their music."
45:05;45:08;"I mean, as you guys know, you make a deal,"
45:08;45:11;"but like this year we got a Springsteen song in the show,"
45:11;45:13;"and I really wasn't sure, 'cause Bruce rarely does it,"
45:13;45:16;"and we heard that he'd read the script pages,"
45:16;45:18;"like on vacation somewhere, and then wrote back,"
45:18;45:20;"yeah, we could do it."
45:20;45:21;"I had a good feeling we'd be able to do it."
45:21;45:26;"Once we got Bob in the first season, then--"
45:26;45:29;"- Bruce was like, okay, Bob did it."
45:29;45:31;"- Yeah, once you get Bob,"
45:31;45:33;"and you sort of then start explaining"
45:33;45:35;"the way you're gonna start using music."
45:35;45:37;"- Was that Atlantic City?"
45:37;45:38;"Yeah, 'cause I remember one of the characters comes in,"
45:38;45:39;"and he's like,"
45:39;45:44;"♪ Well, we blew up the chicken man in Philly last night ♪"
45:44;45:47;"I feel like you really loosened up on this season"
45:47;45:50;"with really going all in with fun musical references."
45:50;45:53;"There's this scene when Giamatti's"
45:53;45:55;"quoting Jerry Rafferty lyrics,"
45:55;45:57;"and he's like, ""Doobies?"""
45:57;46:00;"I was like, talk about, is this made for me?"
46:00;46:02;"What is the Venn diagram between your musical taste"
46:02;46:05;"and Bobby Axelrod's musical tastes?"
46:05;46:06;"'Cause he seems like a metal head, but--"
46:06;46:08;"- Yeah, I mean, Axe loves Metallica."
46:08;46:10;"When I was 21, I was on the road with Metallica."
46:10;46:11;"- Really?"
46:11;46:12;"- I was their A&R guy."
46:12;46:14;"I didn't sign them, but I was their A&R guy."
46:14;46:15;"- Speed of Sound Tour."
46:15;46:16;"- When the guy who signed them left."
46:16;46:19;"It was the Justice for All Tour."
46:19;46:20;"- Oh, okay."
46:20;46:21;"- And-- - Bunch of ass (beep)"
46:21;46:24;"- I was on the road for the tour a bit."
46:24;46:28;"And the reason we have Axe be a metal fan"
46:28;46:30;"is a few different reasons."
46:30;46:33;"One, when he was a kid, he would've liked"
46:33;46:36;"the sort of full-on ethos of metal,"
46:36;46:37;"and he wouldn't have had that much time"
46:37;46:39;"for the politics of punk."
46:39;46:42;"Like, the politics of punk rock, the anarchy in that way,"
46:42;46:44;"wouldn't have really been where he was at."
46:44;46:46;"Later, he would've maybe understood all that"
46:46;46:47;"or cared about it."
46:47;46:48;"And we also liked it as a bonding thing"
46:48;46:50;"for Axe and his friends, and we'd heard a story"
46:50;46:53;"about a guy like Axe, who brought all of his friends"
46:53;46:55;"to see a Pearl Jam in real life."
46:55;46:59;"He brought them to like some Austin festival,"
46:59;47:01;"and they choppered right backstage."
47:01;47:02;"- Oh my God."
47:02;47:04;"- And so we, early on, had this notion"
47:04;47:06;"that Axe would do it, but for him,"
47:06;47:07;"we felt it would be Metallica."
47:07;47:08;"I love all that music."
47:08;47:10;"I'm totally down with that music."
47:10;47:14;"I think I probably have a broader musical palette"
47:14;47:15;"than Axe. - Right."
47:15;47:17;"- Dave and I, Dave is my co-creator,"
47:17;47:18;"parts of the show. - Yeah."
47:18;47:21;"- The two of us love all sorts of music,"
47:21;47:24;"and our taste is sort of in all the characters."
47:24;47:27;"So when Giamatti's talking about the Bell album,"
47:27;47:30;"Al Green's Bell album, that comes from stuff"
47:30;47:32;"we were thinking about, about the Bell album."
47:32;47:35;"And then we try to apply it to the ways"
47:35;47:37;"in which the characters think about the world."
47:37;47:39;"You know, last week, Taylor quoted"
47:39;47:41;"the Turtle song ""Happy Together,"""
47:41;47:43;"and that was a shout out to my dad,"
47:43;47:44;"who, he was a music publisher,"
47:44;47:46;"and that was like the first cut that he ever got,"
47:46;47:47;"was ""Happy Together."""
47:47;47:50;"So we're always using music in various ways."
47:50;47:53;"- It's such a cool way to like flush out"
47:53;47:54;"a character's inner life."
47:54;47:57;"'Cause like we all have these relationships with music,"
47:57;47:59;"and it's rare to see it, like characters like that,"
47:59;48:02;"on a TV or movie, to like really like, you get,"
48:02;48:04;"well, actually, here's another question."
48:04;48:08;"I've noticed this, very, very subtle Lebowski references"
48:08;48:09;"on the show."
48:09;48:13;"Now, do Wags and Axe, like, do they share a love"
48:13;48:16;"for Lebowski in the fictional universe?"
48:16;48:17;"'Cause there's that one scene when the detective,"
48:17;48:20;"or like his weird handler guy is sort of like,"
48:20;48:22;"he's a good man, and thorough."
48:22;48:24;"And then Wags and Axe share a look"
48:24;48:27;"and I'm like, this is so subtle."
48:27;48:30;"Like, that's for like 5% of the audience, if that."
48:30;48:31;"- Yeah, well, I think a good man,"
48:31;48:34;"and he's a good man, Jeffrey, but thorough,"
48:34;48:35;"is something that people would note."
48:35;48:37;"Like, many people love Lebowski."
48:37;48:38;"- Right, it's so-"
48:38;48:39;"- But yes, it's a small, I agree with you,"
48:39;48:40;"it's a small cohort of us."
48:40;48:41;"- Maybe like 20%."
48:41;48:42;"- Yeah, it's a small percentage."
48:42;48:44;"Like, you know, we're throwing stuff,"
48:44;48:45;"like, so you're catching Lebowski,"
48:45;48:47;"someone else is catching Goodfellas,"
48:47;48:49;"someone else is noticing a different reference"
48:49;48:50;"that we put out there."
48:50;48:54;"And so, for us, these characters,"
48:54;48:55;"that's the lingua franca of the world."
48:55;48:57;"They talk that way."
48:57;48:59;"They talk to each other in terms of"
48:59;49:00;"these cultural references,"
49:00;49:03;"and many sort of smart, culturally literate people"
49:03;49:04;"are in that world."
49:04;49:08;"And for us also, it's just adds to the fun"
49:08;49:09;"and adds to the Easter eggs."
49:09;49:11;"For the obsessive audience,"
49:11;49:12;"people watch our show two, three, four times."
49:12;49:13;"- Wow."
49:13;49:14;"- Each episode."
49:14;49:15;"And so I'll see,"
49:15;49:16;"and there are people who have compendiums"
49:16;49:17;"of all the references,"
49:17;49:20;"and for us, it just adds layers and dimensions"
49:20;49:21;"to these characters."
49:21;49:23;"Like that moment, that was scripted."
49:23;49:23;"So these actors are amazing."
49:23;49:25;"So it was scripted that those guys"
49:25;49:26;"look at each other in that spot."
49:26;49:27;"Because yeah, they get,"
49:27;49:28;"they're looking at each other like,"
49:28;49:30;"did Hall just intentionally do that?"
49:30;49:31;"Or did he just do that?"
49:31;49:32;"And so that's what the two guys"
49:32;49:34;"are looking at each other as if to say."
49:34;49:36;"And then for, yes, for you,"
49:36;49:37;"who's hip to Lebowski,"
49:37;49:40;"it's just another reason for you to be into the show."
49:40;49:41;"- Well, it's true."
49:41;49:42;"And it's like, that's the way,"
49:42;49:43;"I'm not a hedge fund guy,"
49:43;49:44;"but that's the way I talk to my friends."
49:44;49:47;"We talk about rock lyrics and movie quotes."
49:47;49:50;"It's like, that's like 90% of the conversations"
49:50;49:51;"I have with my friends."
49:51;49:52;"- Us too."
49:52;49:54;"- That's the way that David and I,"
49:54;49:55;"but David's my lifelong best friend."
49:55;49:57;"So the two of us,"
49:57;49:58;"that's the conversation we've been having"
49:58;50:00;"since we were 14 and 15."
50:00;50:02;"I'm 53 years old now."
50:02;50:05;"So this is a conversation that's been going on forever."
50:05;50:06;"- Brian, I'm sorry."
50:06;50:07;"I'd be, I just got to ask you,"
50:07;50:09;"this is a complete shifting of gears,"
50:09;50:12;"but as a prolific television writer,"
50:12;50:15;"film writer, the TV show ""Seinfeld,"""
50:15;50:17;"what do you think it would be like"
50:17;50:19;"if it was still on television today?"
50:19;50:20;"What would those characters be up to?"
50:20;50:21;"If you were involved even,"
50:21;50:23;"where would you steer those characters?"
50:23;50:27;"- I mean, they would still be talking about nothing, right?"
50:27;50:29;"Hey, by the way, I'm so thrilled to be here."
50:29;50:30;"Thank you guys for having me here."
50:30;50:32;"It's really scoring points for my kids,"
50:32;50:34;"but also I'm just thrilled to be here."
50:34;50:36;"And as I say, this is a perfect day."
50:36;50:37;"What an incredible day."
50:37;50:38;"- Yeah, awesome."

58:35;58:36;"- Hi. - Say hi."
58:36;58:37;"- Hi."
58:37;58:38;"- What's up?"
58:38;58:42;"- I'm a huge, I just wanted to say,"
58:42;58:45;"just for the Crisis crew who's listening,"
58:45;58:47;"I just wanna, maybe they're not aware"
58:47;58:48;"of Tom Sharpling and The Best Show."
58:48;58:50;"I'm a huge fan."
58:50;58:53;"I think that the, this is kind of like a,"

58:55;58:58;"I just think that-- - No, please don't."
58:58;58:59;"- Tom's been doing a show called The Best Show"
58:59;59:00;"for many years."
59:00;59:02;"The world that you and John created,"
59:02;59:03;"the New Bridge universe,"
59:03;59:06;"is honestly one of my favorite comedic achievements."
59:06;59:08;"So I just wanted to kind of tell you that."
59:08;59:09;"- Well, that's nice."
59:09;59:10;"- And when I saw you here today,"
59:10;59:11;"I got kind of nervous and I was like,"
59:11;59:14;"""Oh my God, Tom's here."""
59:14;59:15;"- Look out."
59:15;59:21;"- And I just thought that I'd invite you guys to say hi."
59:21;59:23;"- Yeah."
59:23;59:24;"- What'd you think of the show so far?"
59:24;59:27;"- What if I was just like, ""Yeah, I didn't care for it."""
59:27;59:29;"What if it's like, ""No, it's unbelievable."
59:29;59:33;"The band's just like, it's like a monster band now."
59:33;59:36;"They're just so, like that version of Sunflower"
59:36;59:39;"is just like, we were saying, it's like,"
59:39;59:41;"this is like, these kids here don't know"
59:41;59:44;"that they're watching ""Prog Rock"" right now."
59:44;59:48;"Like this is like, has like some, a lot of yes in here."
59:48;59:50;"Even if the band didn't mean it that way,"
59:50;59:52;"it's like, that's what they're bumping up against."
59:52;59:57;"And it's so exciting to see how just, how big it is."
59:57;59:58;"Yeah, it's crazy."
59:58;59:59;"- Agreed."
59:59;01:00:00;"(laughing)"
01:00:00;01:00:01;"- Okay."
01:00:01;01:00:03;"Aside from ""Vampire Weekend,"""
01:00:03;01:00:05;"what are you listening to right now?"
01:00:05;01:00:08;"Like, what are you into in terms of just like,"
01:00:08;01:00:11;"do you listen to a lot of top 40 pop radio?"
01:00:11;01:00:14;"- Tom's favorite song is ""Thank U, Next."""
01:00:14;01:00:17;"- Yeah, that's my favorite song."
01:00:17;01:00:22;"I listen to a lot of NBA satellite radio talk."
01:00:22;01:00:25;"It's kind of all I listen to now"
01:00:25;01:00:28;"is just people talking about basketball."
01:00:29;01:00:31;"- You were fantasizing about Chris Thompson"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"maybe being one of the courtside celebrities"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"at the Nets games."
01:00:35;01:00:36;"- I still feel like that's a crime"
01:00:36;01:00:41;"that he was not a Brooklyn Nets celebrity"
01:00:41;01:00:44;"after all the support he showed them"
01:00:44;01:00:48;"when they played Barclays Center with his,"
01:00:48;01:00:50;"he had jersey after jersey that he--"
01:00:50;01:00:53;"- Oh, from like old Nets players?"
01:00:53;01:00:54;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:00:54;01:00:55;"- Did you go to that show?"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"- I think I was at that show, right?"
01:00:57;01:01:00;"I saw the Radio City was the second album"
01:01:00;01:01:02;"and Barclay was the third album, right?"
01:01:02;01:01:04;"Does that sound about right?"
01:01:04;01:01:07;"- Have you been on board with a vampire from the beginning?"
01:01:07;01:01:11;"- Yeah, I guess, you know, into the first album."
01:01:11;01:01:15;"I was not from the very beginning, but I felt bad."
01:01:15;01:01:17;"I kind of teased them on the best show"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"and I felt super guilty"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"'cause I was only making fun of their clothes."
01:01:21;01:01:24;"And then I admitted, I went up to SNL one time"
01:01:24;01:01:27;"and I saw them in the hall and everybody was so nice to me."
01:01:27;01:01:29;"And I was just like, I just have to say,"
01:01:29;01:01:32;"I made fun of your clothes on the radio"
01:01:32;01:01:34;"just so I wouldn't be like some two-faced creep."
01:01:34;01:01:36;"'Cause I was just like, I don't know,"
01:01:36;01:01:38;"I don't know why I'm talking about this right now,"
01:01:38;01:01:40;"but I said it, I admitted it."
01:01:40;01:01:42;"I'm not gonna be two-faced with stuff."
01:01:42;01:01:46;"So I said, I said that you dress like the preppy killer,"
01:01:46;01:01:48;"Robert Chambers."
01:01:48;01:01:51;"And they're like, oh, we know."
01:01:51;01:01:52;"It was like, okay."
01:01:52;01:01:53;"I was like, great."
01:01:53;01:01:54;"I said, I love the music."
01:01:54;01:01:57;"And like, okay, that's all that matters."
01:01:57;01:02:00;"And then the friendship to the last of the ages was born"
01:02:00;01:02:05;"on my sneaky talking out the side of my mouth"
01:02:05;01:02:08;"and being a complete coward."
01:02:08;01:02:13;"Yes, so, and here I find myself in the VIP section"
01:02:13;01:02:14;"of a show."
01:02:14;01:02:16;"- 12 years later. - 12 years later, yes."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"- And it's like very lavish here, by the way,"
01:02:18;01:02:20;"just to set the scene."
01:02:20;01:02:21;"It's like opulent."
01:02:21;01:02:23;"There's a lot of gilded, golden stuff."
01:02:23;01:02:26;"And yeah, Tom,"
01:02:26;01:02:27;"you know, I've heard you speak"
01:02:27;01:02:30;"about the Twitter account Seinfeld today"
01:02:30;01:02:32;"on The Best Show as well."
01:02:32;01:02:33;"And I just wanna clarify"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"that that's not the account that I run."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"- No, no, I know that."
01:02:36;01:02:38;"Don't worry. - I understand the distinction."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"Okay, I just wanted to make sure,"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"'cause a lot of people think it's the same."
01:02:41;01:02:43;"And you were very savage,"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"but I just wanna say that my approach was,"
01:02:45;01:02:46;"I had the same feeling as you,"
01:02:46;01:02:49;"which is why I started the whole thing."
01:02:49;01:02:52;"On a separate note, and I don't wanna put you on the spot,"
01:02:52;01:02:54;"has anyone ever told you that you look like Chris Noth"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"a little bit from ""Law & Order""?"
01:02:56;01:02:58;"Nicer than what people usually say."
01:02:58;01:02:59;"- That's a good call, dude."
01:02:59;01:03:01;"Like, you could be like his brother, I feel,"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"like his comedic brother in a film."
01:03:03;01:03:07;"- They usually think I just look like some kind of like,"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"janitor or something."
01:03:09;01:03:12;"Like, they usually just ask me, like,"
01:03:12;01:03:13;"how can I get into this room?"
01:03:13;01:03:15;"Do you have keys for this room?"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"(laughing)"
01:03:17;01:03:18;"Just like, I don't work here."
01:03:18;01:03:21;"It's probably 'cause I dress in blue all the time."
01:03:21;01:03:24;"And I just have a give off a kind of janitor vibe."
01:03:24;01:03:27;"Yeah. - That's pretty good."
01:03:27;01:03:28;"Mr. Big."
01:03:28;01:03:30;"- I'll take it, right?"
01:03:30;01:03:31;"Thank you. - Well, the first three,"
01:03:31;01:03:33;"it's ""Law & Order,"" Mr. Big."
01:03:33;01:03:34;"Is that it?"
01:03:34;01:03:35;"He's like on ""The Good Wife."""
01:03:35;01:03:36;"Is that a thing?"
01:03:36;01:03:39;"One of the good shows. - One of the goods."
01:03:39;01:03:41;"- Claire, what do you look like these days?"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"- You know, just hanging loose."
01:03:43;01:03:46;"What?"
01:03:46;01:03:47;"Fast and the news."
01:03:47;01:03:50;"I do wanna tell, can I tell Mike's CT,"
01:03:50;01:03:52;"Chris talking stories? - He's talking stories."
01:03:52;01:03:53;"This is a good one."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- Where when he was on ""The Best Show,"""
01:03:54;01:03:57;"I was with my boyfriend at the time,"
01:03:57;01:04:00;"who was also, came to visit the studio."
01:04:00;01:04:02;"And Chris offered us a ride home back to Brooklyn,"
01:04:02;01:04:04;"which was very nice, from New Jersey."
01:04:04;01:04:06;"Wow, the nicest thing."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"- It's a long distance."
01:04:07;01:04:09;"- Long distance."
01:04:09;01:04:13;"And my boyfriend somehow managed to get drunk"
01:04:13;01:04:18;"off of beer in the, however long the show was,"
01:04:18;01:04:23;"and was feeling way too comfortable in Chris's van,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"and said something to the effect of like,"
01:04:25;01:04:28;"he was a bartender, and he goes,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"""Whenever someone puts your guys' music on,"
01:04:30;01:04:33;"""I'm always like, turn this (beep) off."""
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Wow."
01:04:34;01:04:37;"- But you're really cool, thanks so much for the ride."
01:04:37;01:04:42;"So that's my connection to Vampire Weekend."
01:04:42;01:04:44;"- But I feel like Vampire Weekend is a band"
01:04:44;01:04:46;"that encourages that kind of openness."
01:04:46;01:04:47;"- I think so too."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"- Yeah, and it just speaks to their connection"
01:04:49;01:04:52;"to their audience, that your boyfriend"
01:04:52;01:04:55;"would feel comfortable even saying that to them."
01:04:55;01:04:59;"Whereas he may not say that to Kings of Leon."
01:04:59;01:04:59;"- Exactly."
01:04:59;01:05:01;"- Or Imagine Dragons."
01:05:01;01:05:03;"No disrespect to Imagine Dragons,"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"'cause they do some great work."
01:05:05;01:05:08;"Thanks so much for hopping on the mic for a second."
01:05:08;01:05:09;"- Oh no, thanks for having us."
01:05:09;01:05:10;"- Really an honor to meet you guys."

01:08:30;01:08:36;"uh i'm here with brian jones the lead lead guitarist is that fair to say it rotates but"
01:08:36;01:08:42;"yeah yeah sure i feel like i feel like you're the lead guitarist of vampire weekend i'll defer"
01:08:42;01:08:48;"to ezra on that one i was just commenting you on your playing and the song sunflower especially"
01:08:48;01:08:56;"really goes off you guys took it to almost like a froggy level we we added a lot to it we have"
01:08:56;01:09:03;"and that's one of like three kind of ways we do that song oh really there's or we have we've done"
01:09:03;01:09:09;"it like 15 different ways wow but we've only played live i think two of the different iterations of it"
01:09:09;01:09:16;"we have another jam that's even deadier than the one that we did tonight um right tonight the one"
01:09:16;01:09:21;"that we did tonight is kind of like sabbathy yeah it was like it was like it started kind of dead"
01:09:21;01:09:26;"kind of firing them out and then it got heavy right exactly it goes like pretty prog rocky"
01:09:26;01:09:30;"for sure but there's another one that's like pretty just like i don't know when we're gonna"
01:09:30;01:09:35;"do it but you'll hear it and you'll be like oh yeah that's very so then before the set were you"
01:09:35;01:09:39;"like we're doing the sabbath version tonight okay how does it work we originally planned to not do"
01:09:39;01:09:44;"the sabbath version and we were because you know there's only so much time in the set yeah but we"
01:09:44;01:09:49;"someone it happened they're called an audible on the spot be like yo we do it why aren't we doing"
01:09:49;01:09:55;"the jam burden of it so wow i mean needless to say i was very excited when that audible was called"
01:09:56;01:10:00;"wait so does that mean like into the in-ear or what does that mean audible is called we have a"
01:10:00;01:10:04;"little bit of a closed circuit system on the set oh wow we have a we have different names for all"
01:10:04;01:10:09;"the jams right so like like code names yeah and it was just sunflower we call them other things"
01:10:09;01:10:16;"okay but we call them other things the one we played tonight was stone flower uh-huh but it"
01:10:16;01:10:22;"was sunflower on the set list it just you know and then just kind of impromptu in the moment"
01:10:22;01:10:26;"you guys went to the sabbath we should do sunflower and then we did it it was great i that was kind of"
01:10:26;01:10:32;"mind-blowing i have to say that's a really fun one to do i i love playing that so how does that"
01:10:32;01:10:37;"like in the rehearsals how did that um take form was it sort of like like the first time you played"
01:10:37;01:10:42;"sunflower with the band was he like let's play the song and then to see what happens or like how does"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"it how does that develop to that i'd say there were probably like three or four times we had a lot of"
01:10:46;01:10:50;"time to just rehearse because you know just like that's how the schedule worked out and we just"
01:10:50;01:10:56;"had a lot of time to mess around and experiment yeah so we had a right i'd say we jammed on that"
01:10:56;01:11:01;"probably five different times before we ever solidified anything so we just came up with ideas"
01:11:01;01:11:08;"and then yeah that's the first kind of like solidified like we should do that right live jam"
01:11:08;01:11:12;"that we came up with right and then there's a couple other ones i'm i'm psyched to see them"
01:11:12;01:11:18;"throughout uh the rest of the day and the year so anyway thanks brian for just jumping on the"

01:34:49;01:34:53;"a part of this except i'm a little bummed out that i wasn't a part of the record gotta be honest"
01:34:53;01:34:57;"i think we can tell which hyams sister is ezra's favorite"
01:34:57;01:35:05;"right i feel like danielle definitely his favorite and i'm feeling very jealous about it but i mean"
01:35:05;01:35:10;"danielle was very like proximal to the studio right like it was might have been just like"
01:35:10;01:35:15;"convenient i mean i live five minutes away i could there could have been like a vampire weekend bat"
01:35:15;01:35:20;"signal that i could have just seen and then driven on over but whatever it's fine next record next"
01:35:20;01:35:24;"record will be my record playing the seed for the next record yeah i am but now you're like a part"
01:35:24;01:35:28;"of the band like you're on this life you're like and who knows there might be remixes and like"
01:35:28;01:35:33;"live records and like this could just be the start of a whole thing oh my god i'm quitting hyam"
01:35:33;01:35:38;"so basically i'm quitting hyam all right cool so i saw you in the park last time uh what was that a"
01:35:38;01:35:43;"couple weeks ago and we were talking about how you you hadn't been able to score any of the merch"
01:35:43;01:35:47;"that's true because you're on the inside track even though you're not on the album i know but"
01:35:47;01:35:52;"now you said you you have gotten the merch well i had to like beg borrow and steal some merch it"
01:35:52;01:35:57;"was like well apparently when i heard that the vampire weekend underground um told me that there's"
01:35:57;01:36:04;"only 20 shirts made of each shirt 20 there's so many people that show up to these things and all"
01:36:04;01:36:07;"i wanted i like the first thing i did when i got to the park was like i need to get merch because"
01:36:07;01:36:12;"i knew it was gonna sell out like i knew they were gonna get taken yeah and they were because"
01:36:12;01:36:18;"there's 20 shirts there's so many there's like a hundred people there i was like okay so i made"
01:36:18;01:36:24;"sure to get a i think the shirt is like commemorating the album release so i have one piece"
01:36:24;01:36:29;"of merch i was saying though i want to meet the person that has all the shirts because there's"
01:36:29;01:36:36;"gonna be one person out there yeah ezra i gotta meet ezra as far as the only one that has the"
01:36:36;01:36:41;"only all the shirts so you actually did a show on on beats one which is the station that we're"
01:36:41;01:36:46;"people are listening to us on now and what was the show actually called well the actual show"
01:36:46;01:36:51;"is called hyme time yeah which is nice it rhymes it's right it rhymes but you wanted to call it"
01:36:51;01:36:58;"something different we did well ezra had a show time crisis came out a season before hyme time"
01:36:58;01:37:04;"came out and we wanted it to be better than ezra's so we wanted to name our show better than ezra"
01:37:04;01:37:10;"well we see how that all worked out apple was not down did they say why i mean healthy competition"
01:37:10;01:37:16;"i think is great but i think i think they just wanted to differentiate between the shows but"
01:37:16;01:37:20;"i don't know i still think that better we hyme time can come back as better than ezra that could"
01:37:20;01:37:25;"be like our like cool underground man i think you should negotiate more strongly you should say hey"
01:37:25;01:37:31;"if you want us back it's that time better than ezra and just like the every episode it's just"
01:37:31;01:37:37;"a different photo of ezra as like the thing i'm like like a very awkward photo with like it's one"
01:37:37;01:37:43;"eye open and one eye closed which whichever um just going back to the merch stuff for a second"
01:37:43;01:37:48;"i think that we should be making more higher quantities too and i've made some of that merch"
01:37:48;01:37:54;"i know and the manufacturers they always go oh 200 shirts and i have to go no no no 20 that wasn't"
01:37:54;01:37:59;"a typo you guys but it's all it's ezra you know he likes it scarce i know he's a visionary"
01:37:59;01:38:04;"[ __ ] ezra but also the amount of shirts you're making you're probably spending a lot of money"
01:38:04;01:38:09;"on printing let me tell you i mean i don't want to you know get into the inner workings of how"
01:38:09;01:38:14;"but yeah the cost is coming from a person that we we manufacture our merch 20 shirts is a high"
01:38:14;01:38:19;"quality there if you have one of those shirts out there it is worth its weight in gold it is very"
01:38:19;01:38:26;"expensive to make i feel you i bet the ebay scene is going to be fierce if it's not already grilled"
01:38:27;01:38:32;"yeah all that well there you go we should have just taken them to sell them we should have started"
01:38:32;01:38:37;"our own business you should you should start your own business it's like t-shirt scalpers yeah we"
01:38:37;01:38:42;"should be our own bootleg merchers we should make our own bootleg merch actually there have been a"
01:38:42;01:38:46;"lot of people making like fans making their own bootleg merch i'm wearing one right now made by"
01:38:46;01:38:51;"a fan that was sent to the studio no way oh my god that's amazing it's like lisa simpson like"

01:39:01;01:39:05;"don't even know someone sent colin might know but anyway any questions about anything i think this"
