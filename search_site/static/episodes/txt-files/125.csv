00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:02;00:08;"In this episode, we'll be talking about one of the greatest American bands of all time."
00:08;00:10;"Which, you ask?"
00:10;00:12;"Here's a hint."
00:12;00:15;"They made three albums and one album of covers."
00:15;00:17;"You'll find out real soon."
00:17;00:22;"All that, plus the top hits of 2020 and 1992."
00:22;00:28;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:30;00:32;"They passed me by"
00:32;00:36;"All of those great romances"
00:36;00:39;"You were a felt rubbing me"
00:39;00:43;"All my rightful chances"
00:43;00:46;"My picture clear"
00:46;00:50;"Everything seemed so easy"
00:50;00:54;"And so I dealt you the blow"
00:54;00:57;"When a bus had to go"
00:58;01:02;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:02;01:05;"One of us is crying"
01:05;01:08;"One of us is lying"
01:08;01:12;"Even only then"
01:12;01:14;"Time Crisis back again."
01:14;01:15;"What's up, Jake?"
01:15;01:17;"Back again."
01:17;01:19;"Crazy being on this two-week schedule."
01:19;01:20;"Feels like forever now."
01:20;01:24;"Yeah, I haven't seen you guys in, what feels like months."
01:24;01:26;"We gotta figure out something to do for the bi-weeks."
01:27;01:28;"A private recording?"
01:28;01:32;"I guess last week I was sort of like, ""Oh, we're not doing TC this week."""
01:32;01:34;"Well, honestly, I could use a week off."
01:34;01:35;"I mean, we've been going pretty hard."
01:35;01:38;"I mean, this is hard work, so I needed a week off."
01:38;01:40;"Just to recuperate?"
01:40;01:41;"I needed to reset."
01:41;01:43;"Just to clear your head?"
01:43;01:44;"Yep."
01:44;01:47;"So what have you been up to with all this free time?"
01:47;01:50;"I mean, jeez, nothing wild to report."
01:50;01:54;"Just been working in the studio and making some more Home Depot runs."
01:54;01:55;"Oh yeah? Wait."
01:55;01:56;"Yep."
01:57;01:59;"I mean, Seinfeld, have you been monitoring some of this?"
01:59;02:01;"Isn't Home Depot canceled?"
02:01;02:03;"Aren't you supposed to go to Lowe's?"
02:03;02:04;"Yeah, what are they?"
02:04;02:06;"The Trump Company?"
02:06;02:08;"I'm gonna resurface this."
02:08;02:10;"I'm pretty sure the founder of Home Depot,"
02:10;02:12;"whose name I'm forgetting,"
02:12;02:14;"gave like seven million."
02:14;02:16;"What is that?"
02:16;02:18;"I got one more hard-boiled egg that I'm cracking."
02:18;02:20;"All right, let's just let you get to that egg."
02:20;02:21;"Is it really loud?"
02:21;02:23;"Yeah."
02:23;02:24;"Full disclosure."
02:24;02:26;"Earlier today,"
02:27;02:30;"I was on the phone with my manager, actually."
02:30;02:32;"And he told me he ate some hard-boiled eggs."
02:32;02:33;"He said, ""Do you like hard-boiled eggs?"""
02:33;02:35;"And I said, ""As a matter of fact, I love them."
02:35;02:37;"But I don't have them that often."""
02:37;02:39;"It just reminded me that I'd like to have a hard-boiled egg."
02:39;02:41;"When I was in college,"
02:41;02:43;"I would eat like six a day."
02:43;02:44;"Jesus, dude."
02:44;02:46;"And I actually had high cholesterol."
02:46;02:49;"At some point, when I was like 20--"
02:49;02:51;"Did we talk about this on the show?"
02:51;02:52;"Or maybe in real time?"
02:52;02:56;"I remember you telling me about this in 2005."
02:56;02:58;"When I met you, you were like, ""Dude, I have high cholesterol."""
02:58;03:03;"And I was like, ""Are you just crushing hot dog carts non-stop?"
03:03;03:05;"Or what explains the high cholesterol?"""
03:05;03:10;"I was on a real dirtbag New York college student diet."
03:10;03:13;"I'd make a lot of hard-boiled eggs for myself."
03:13;03:15;"You know, like for lunch or dinner."
03:15;03:18;"And then I'd love a street dog."
03:18;03:22;"So those were probably my two go-to dishes."
03:22;03:24;"Hard-boiled eggs and street dogs,"
03:24;03:26;"which I guess both have a lot of cholesterol."
03:26;03:29;"I mean, six a day is hardcore."
03:29;03:32;"I think the trick might be that you're not supposed to have the yolks"
03:32;03:33;"or something like that."
03:33;03:34;"Precisely."
03:34;03:37;"Well, anyway, Jake, you might have to move your loyalty to Lowe's."
03:37;03:38;"Oh, I found it."
03:38;03:41;"Billionaire co-founder Bernie Marcus"
03:41;03:44;"told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution"
03:44;03:48;"that he plans to support Trump's re-election campaign."
03:48;03:51;"And Twitter was up in arms."
03:51;03:52;"Somebody tweeted,"
03:52;03:53;"""If you plan on buying a hammer, wood,"
03:54;03:56;"or any home improvement items from Home Depot,"
03:56;03:59;"you may as well send donations directly to #Trump2020."""
03:59;04:01;"And then Home Depot said,"
04:01;04:05;"""Marcus has not been involved in the company for over a decade."
04:05;04:08;"We don't have any political affiliations."""
04:08;04:09;"He's still making bank?"
04:09;04:11;"Yeah, he's still making bank."
04:11;04:13;"He still owns a chunk of it."
04:13;04:15;"I presume he does."
04:15;04:16;"I didn't, you know, obviously,"
04:16;04:18;"there's so much to catch up on,"
04:18;04:20;"so much going on in the news."
04:20;04:22;"I didn't even get to go that deep on it."
04:22;04:24;"But I feel like when I first saw this"
04:24;04:28;"about Home Depot being owned by a Trump supporter,"
04:28;04:29;"a lot of people were just like,"
04:29;04:30;"""That's why you got to go to Lowe's."""
04:30;04:32;"And it's just kind of dawning on me now"
04:32;04:34;"how brutal the retail landscape is,"
04:34;04:37;"that that was like the dominant advice."
04:37;04:39;"Like nobody was like..."
04:39;04:41;"And I mean, I got to say,"
04:41;04:44;"the bad guys won, at least in the retail landscape."
04:44;04:46;"And I really hope that a lot of small businesses"
04:46;04:47;"can come out of COVID."
04:47;04:51;"But it's like the combo of like big box stores and Amazon."
04:52;04:53;"-Brutal. -It's insurmountable."
04:53;04:55;"There used to be the slightly quaint"
04:55;04:58;"""You've got mail, David and Goliath"" story."
04:58;05:01;"Because I've never actually seen ""You've got mail."""
05:01;05:04;"But that's about like a big Barnes & Noble opening."
05:04;05:07;"And Tom Hanks plays the, you know,"
05:07;05:09;"-Barnes or Noble. -Yes."
05:09;05:11;"And Meg Ryan owns a cute little"
05:11;05:14;"""Mom looking for a pop"" bookshop."
05:14;05:16;"-Is that basically the plot? -Yes."
05:16;05:17;"-That's it. -Okay, so..."
05:17;05:18;"Jake, have you seen it?"
05:18;05:20;"Like 20 years ago."
05:21;05:22;"I think I saw ""You've got mail"""
05:22;05:25;"with my brother and my grandmother in the theater."
05:25;05:27;"-Like weird matinee. -Oh."
05:27;05:30;"Were you like in college and Dave was like in high school?"
05:30;05:33;"I guess. When was that movie? Like 2000 or something?"
05:33;05:34;"It was 1998."
05:34;05:36;"Yeah, I would have been in college."
05:36;05:37;"Like maybe like Christmas break."
05:37;05:39;"Oh, that's sweet. ""Rom-Com with Grandma."""
05:39;05:43;"I guess that was her last year on this earth."
05:43;05:45;"Died late '98. So maybe..."
05:45;05:48;"-Damn, for real? -One of the last movies she saw."
05:48;05:48;"Yeah."
05:48;05:51;"It probably meant a lot to her to go see a movie with her..."
05:51;05:54;"two handsome young grandsons."
05:54;05:55;"It was probably a sweet memory for her."
05:55;05:56;"Yeah."
05:56;05:58;"So the plot of the film is..."
05:58;06:02;"Mr. Barnes Noble versus the ""Mom looking for a pop"" bookshop."
06:02;06:05;"And I think at that time there was something..."
06:05;06:08;"It's very 90s, you know, just like..."
06:08;06:09;"The times are changing."
06:09;06:10;"But you know what?"
06:10;06:12;"Sometimes love can win in the end."
06:12;06:15;"I know we got these big box stores popping up everywhere."
06:15;06:17;"But in some places they're actually like..."
06:17;06:18;"making books accessible to people."
06:19;06:21;"And, you know, in other places..."
06:21;06:22;"we're gonna find a middle ground."
06:22;06:25;"Where like the small cute shops can win out too."
06:25;06:28;"That was kind of like the late 90s vibe."
06:28;06:29;"But of course it's gotten worse since then."
06:29;06:31;"But I do think it's like..."
06:31;06:34;"as often happens in the course of history..."
06:34;06:35;"you have this like binary..."
06:35;06:38;"and you're trying to figure out how it's gonna get reconciled."
06:38;06:39;"And then the whole thing gets like..."
06:39;06:41;"hit by a Mack truck you didn't see coming."
06:41;06:43;"And I think that's kind of like..."
06:43;06:46;"Amazon and direct to consumer stuff."
06:46;06:48;"Yeah, that'd be like ""You've Got Mail 2."""
06:48;06:50;"- Like Enter Bezos. - Yeah."
06:50;06:53;"Now Tom Hanks like loses all his money."
06:53;06:54;"He's going bankrupt."
06:54;06:56;"They're like both against the ropes."
06:56;06:59;"But yeah, so when I think about people being like..."
06:59;07:00;"""Don't go to Home Depot, go to Lowe's."""
07:00;07:02;"And then you just think about like..."
07:02;07:03;"is anybody gonna be like..."
07:03;07:05;"""Go to your local hardware store."""
07:05;07:07;"It's almost like people don't even like believe in that anymore."
07:07;07:09;"Go to Pasadena Lumber and Supply."
07:09;07:10;"That's your local spot?"
07:10;07:12;"I mean, admittedly, there's a Home Depot..."
07:12;07:16;"like literally three blocks from my studio where I work."
07:17;07:20;"So I'm like, ""Oh man, I'm getting low on painter's tape..."
07:20;07:22;"and shop towels."""
07:22;07:23;"So I'm just gonna pop over there."
07:23;07:26;"It's hard to be a convenience at the end of the day."
07:26;07:28;"But if I'm planning it out and I'm like..."
07:28;07:29;"""I need to stock up on some stuff."""
07:29;07:31;"I'll cruise to Pasadena Lumber."
08:10;08:13;"Before we get into the whole show..."
08:13;08:17;"we don't want to just say that the last episode..."
08:17;08:21;"was our episode talking about cops and back to the Grateful Dead."
08:21;08:24;"Because I don't think you can be a fan of the Grateful Dead..."
08:24;08:27;"if you don't have a healthy distrust of authority."
08:27;08:29;"Especially the police."
08:29;08:31;"And actually, Seinfeld, I wanted to ask you..."
08:31;08:35;"I've been very appreciative seeing how you've used Seinfeld..."
08:35;08:39;"memes to talk about police brutality over the past few weeks."
08:39;08:42;"I saw one time somebody trying to give you some sh*t..."
08:42;08:44;"and you roasted them right back with another Seinfeld meme."
08:44;08:46;"That was pretty cool."
08:46;08:48;"What's been the reaction in the Seinfeld meme community?"
08:48;08:52;"I imagine with Seinfeld fans, you know, it's like..."
08:52;08:55;"Upper West Side New Yorkers tend to be liberal."
08:55;08:58;"But you know, even with liberals, as we've discussed on the show..."
08:58;09:00;"you never know how they're going to fall..."
09:00;09:02;"when it comes to the police brutality issue."
09:02;09:04;"You know, I've been pleasantly surprised."
09:04;09:06;"It's been generally pretty positive."
09:06;09:10;"I think, you know, every once in a while over the years..."
09:10;09:14;"I would sort of do something, say something that would show..."
09:14;09:16;"that I'm like, the person behind this meme account..."
09:16;09:18;"is trying to be on the right side of history."
09:18;09:21;"And I think that weirdly I've whittled out..."
09:21;09:24;"a lot of the sort of like, bad elements."
09:24;09:28;"So I have this sort of consolidated following of people..."
09:28;09:31;"who are sort of aligned with how I feel about things."
09:31;09:34;"But yeah, I mean, ultimately, you know..."
09:34;09:36;"there are enough people following the account..."
09:36;09:37;"that like, why not try to contort..."
09:37;09:40;"these Seinfeld memes into like, saying something."
09:40;09:42;"But yeah, it's been pretty positive."
09:42;09:45;"The one that really struck a chord with people..."
09:45;09:47;"was a scene from..."
09:47;09:49;"was it from the Chinese restaurant episode?"
09:49;09:52;"Yeah, I'm trying to remember what that was."
09:52;09:54;"I'm like, looking at it. What was it?"
09:54;09:57;"-Oh yeah, Jerry. -Yeah, so what did Jerry actually say?"
09:57;10:00;"So, Jerry is talking about..."
10:00;10:03;"kind of how useless the police are and he jokes, make it one job."
10:03;10:05;"Cop/garbage man."
10:05;10:08;"Fuse those two jobs together and he says..."
10:08;10:12;"""I always see cops walking around with nothing to do. Grab a broom."""
10:12;10:15;"It was just kind of a perfect sentiment."
10:15;10:17;"I mean, it's also..."
10:17;10:21;"for a guy whose comedy is like, explicitly apolitical..."
10:21;10:24;"and you know, like, Jerry Seinfeld is definitely not..."
10:24;10:26;"woke in the modern sense."
10:26;10:29;"He's gotten in hot water a few times for..."
10:29;10:30;"people asking him about, you know,"
10:30;10:32;"why weren't there more black characters on Seinfeld?"
10:32;10:34;"And I'm like, ""I don't know."""
10:34;10:36;"Or like, asking him about..."
10:36;10:39;"having more women on..."
10:39;10:40;"comedians and cars getting coffee."
10:40;10:42;"He's like, ""If they're funny, they can come on."""
10:42;10:43;"He sometimes can have a kind of..."
10:43;10:45;"a seemingly flip attitude."
10:45;10:47;"Although I have noticed in interviews..."
10:47;10:49;"he seems to have made an effort to like, catch up."
10:49;10:51;"I mean, he has younger daughters."
10:51;10:54;"So maybe he's... he's trying. But anyway..."
10:54;10:57;"generally speaking, his point has always been, ""Listen, I'm like a technician."
10:57;11:00;"I craft jokes. I make them as funny as possible."
11:00;11:02;"That's what I do. That's what I love."
11:02;11:05;"I'm not interested in social commentary..."
11:05;11:07;"the way that many great comedians..."
11:07;11:11;"like a Dave Chappelle, who just released this excellent recent special."
11:11;11:14;"They've never been the same."""
11:14;11:17;"So anyway, it is kind of funny to like, grab something from Seinfeld..."
11:17;11:21;"that so weirdly intersects with the ""defund the police"" concept."
11:21;11:23;"Because it's not just a joke making fun of cops."
11:23;11:26;"It's also, in a weird way, a joke about..."
11:26;11:28;"resources."
11:28;11:30;"What do we need people to actually do in a city?"
11:30;11:33;"And it is kind of like, messed up that..."
11:33;11:36;"the idea of, you know, famously..."
11:36;11:39;"people like, look down on being a garbage man..."
11:39;11:41;"because you're like, ""Ugh, garbage!"""
11:41;11:44;"Whereas, obviously, that's a difficult job..."
11:44;11:47;"that brings so much to the quality of life in a place."
11:47;11:50;"You know, New York, there were times in the 70s..."
11:50;11:53;"when there'd be garbage strikes and it was like, total chaos, you know?"
11:53;11:56;"Think about how many rats there are in New York in the first place."
11:56;11:58;"Let alone when the garbage doesn't get picked up."
11:58;12:00;"So anyway, he's making this joke."
12:00;12:02;"He's just kind of like, ""Why couldn't that same person..."
12:02;12:04;"be doing a little bit more to help out?"""
12:04;12:07;"It's funny too, how like, amusing..."
12:07;12:09;"like, sort of a throwaway joke..."
12:09;12:12;"you know, over time, can kind of accumulate this new meaning..."
12:12;12:16;"and kind of, yeah, as you said, like, speak to this moment."
12:16;12:19;"Did he bust out, ""You got time to lean, you got time to clean""?"
12:19;12:23;"- Did he bust that one out? - Is that from Seinfeld?"
12:23;12:26;"Well, that's just a classic, like, restaurant industry..."
12:26;12:29;"- Got it. - manager."
12:29;12:32;"It does have that Seinfeld rhythm to it."
12:32;12:35;"- But I don't think he bust that out. - Wait, Jake, has anybody ever said that..."
12:35;12:37;"- to you in one of your jobs? - Yes."
12:37;12:41;"It's sort of on par with ""Working Hard"" or ""Hardly Working,"" right?"
12:41;12:42;"- It's one of those? - Yeah."
12:42;12:45;"It's just like a... it's a ball buster."
12:45;12:48;"It's just like, I remember when I was working at Papa John's..."
12:48;12:49;"and I was doing delivery."
12:49;12:52;"But like, there'd be times when it was kind of dead in the store."
12:52;12:56;"So then there'd be like three or four drivers standing around in the back,"
12:56;12:59;"like, wearing windbreakers and just like, BSing, hanging out."
12:59;13:01;"And then the manager would come back and be like,"
13:01;13:05;"""Guys, listen, I know it's dead, but we want to get out of here a decent hour."
13:05;13:08;"You got time to lean, you got time to clean, bud."""
13:08;13:13;"Someone start handling all the dishes in the sink, you know."
13:13;13:15;"Someone could go mop the walk-in, whatever."
13:15;13:18;"I just remember that one being like, ""Oh, my God."""
13:18;13:20;"It is kind of a great phrase. And it's..."
13:20;13:22;"I guess there's two ways to interpret it."
13:22;13:25;"One would be the... interpret it as just kind of like..."
13:25;13:31;"the, you know, disgusting American obsession with efficiency and work."
13:31;13:34;"That's like, you're employed, you're on the clock, get to work."
13:34;13:38;"Like, imagine in France, if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
13:38;13:41;"That'd be a very alien concept, you know."
13:41;13:45;"Famously, in France, people take to the streets every week"
13:45;13:50;"to, you know, protest and demand better working conditions."
13:50;13:52;"And, you know, like in a lot of jobs where you have a union,"
13:52;13:57;"part of what a union fights for is to not let employees be taken advantage of"
13:57;14:01;"and be told, ""Hey, I'm paying you, so you do everything that I ask you to."""
14:01;14:04;"Because, you know, there's a way that that could obviously be dehumanizing."
14:04;14:07;"That concept in the hands of the wrong employer."
14:07;14:10;"Be like, ""Hey, man, I just signed up to deliver pizzas."""
14:10;14:13;"And it's like, ""No, dude, you're gonna scrub the floors."""
14:13;14:15;"Just be like, ""Man, are you kidding?"" You know."
14:15;14:17;"So that's the negative interpretation."
14:17;14:21;"I mean, if you take it outside of the realm of work,"
14:21;14:26;"I kind of like it, which is kind of like, ""Hey, you got time to sit on your ass?"""
14:26;14:30;"You could be doing a little something to make your environment just that much nicer."
14:30;14:33;"I almost like it more applied to the household."
14:33;14:35;"Because I've had to teach myself that lesson, too."
14:35;14:39;"I've probably been in a domestic environment for the most time in my adult life"
14:39;14:41;"during the pandemic."
14:41;14:45;"Because, you know, just been like young, moving all over the place,"
14:45;14:48;"and on tour all the time. So just to be posted up and just, you know,"
14:48;14:52;"I feel like I'm experiencing the rhythms of the household in a different way"
14:52;14:55;"and realizing, like, I like to sweep up in the kitchen."
14:55;14:56;"I just kind of realize, you know what?"
14:56;14:59;"If you have time to just throw on some music and just chit-chat,"
14:59;15:01;"sometimes you could just be sweeping up."
15:01;15:04;"You do that four or five times a day, you got yourself a clean kitchen."
15:04;15:06;"If you got time to lean, you got time to clean."
15:06;15:08;"I like it as a lifestyle concept."
15:08;15:11;"I don't like it as the manager of a Papa John's"
15:11;15:14;"busting a young driver's balls."
15:14;15:16;"[laughs]"
15:16;15:19;"But yeah, the fact that, I mean, I've noticed that,"
15:19;15:22;"to throw back to the last episode, we had Alex Vitalian."
15:22;15:23;"Obviously, he's not the only person saying this,"
15:23;15:26;"but I noticed he was quoted in a New York Times op-ed."
15:26;15:30;"You see more and more thinkers and writers talking about this concept."
15:30;15:32;"It does seem like this moment,"
15:32;15:35;"the concept of defunding the police has struck a chord."
15:35;15:37;"I don't know how it's going to pan out."
15:37;15:40;"And you definitely see some debate about whether that's the right language."
15:41;15:45;"But I do think it's such a positive reframing of the concept."
15:45;15:50;"Because I think the argument about whether cops are good or bad,"
15:50;15:53;"of course, one group of people is going to say they're bad,"
15:53;15:57;"people who have seen the abuses and the violence."
15:57;15:59;"And another group of people who are obsessed with law and order,"
15:59;16:02;"maybe are cops or no cops, are going to be like,"
16:02;16:05;"""Well, I'm not violent and I'm just trying to keep my community safe."""
16:05;16:07;"These people are never going to agree."
16:07;16:10;"There's never going to be a moment where one side is proven right."
16:10;16:16;"But I think more people could agree that redistributing budgets"
16:16;16:19;"could be a really positive thing for everybody involved."
16:19;16:23;"I don't know if by the time the show airs, this is going to be super out of date,"
16:23;16:30;"but have you guys been following some of the cops versus fast food restaurant drama?"
16:30;16:33;"A little bit. I saw there was an incident at Shake Shack"
16:33;16:36;"where they thought they got poisoned, but it turned out they didn't."
16:36;16:38;"Is that more or less it?"
16:38;16:41;"Some NYPD cops, I guess, felt sick."
16:41;16:44;"And by the way, on just a human level,"
16:44;16:47;"I do sympathize with anybody who has a stressful job."
16:47;16:50;"Obviously, there's millions and millions of cops."
16:50;16:54;"Many of them get into the profession with good intentions,"
16:54;16:56;"and I'm sure it is a very stressful job."
16:56;17:00;"So I could imagine maybe you go to Shake Shack during a tense time"
17:00;17:02;"and you feel a strange feeling in your stomach."
17:02;17:04;"So Seinfeld, what were their symptoms?"
17:04;17:07;"The article that I have here, which is from Rolling Stone,"
17:07;17:13;"says that the officers believed that their milkshakes had been tampered with bleach."
17:13;17:16;"Bleach? Wow."
17:16;17:21;"Yeah. And then the police chief said that after an investigation,"
17:21;17:23;"they determined there was no criminality."
17:23;17:25;"So they felt okay?"
17:25;17:28;"I thought they were having stomach pains and it was even more serious"
17:28;17:30;"and they just started pointing fingers."
17:30;17:34;"I found another article. They got diarrhea, food poisoning."
17:34;17:36;"That's rough for an adult."
17:36;17:39;"I mean, milkshakes are just tough on the system."
17:39;17:42;"I wonder if anybody considered that."
17:42;17:46;"That's a lot of fat and dairy and just sugar."
17:46;17:49;"It's just taxing on a system."
17:49;17:53;"I wonder how you investigate anything like that."
17:53;17:56;"Maybe other customers were also sick"
17:56;18:00;"or they talked to the employees and the employees seemed credible."
18:00;18:01;"Maybe they were lying."
18:01;18:04;"How do you really ascertain that?"
18:05;18:06;"That's a really good question."
18:06;18:10;"And actually, it takes me to one thought that I've been having lately."
18:10;18:13;"There's so many different types of cops."
18:13;18:17;"As we've discussed, the idea of defunding the police and changing resources,"
18:17;18:21;"a lot of it has to do with how many people should be investigating crimes,"
18:21;18:23;"holding weapons, tracking down people,"
18:23;18:26;"the things that really lead to violence."
18:26;18:28;"One person having a gun, get out of the car."
18:28;18:30;"These things that we see over and over again."
18:30;18:33;"In a weird way, one thing that I started just thinking about was like,"
18:33;18:35;"I could be totally wrong about this."
18:35;18:37;"Maybe Alex Vitale would have a whole explanation."
18:37;18:42;"But I was like, couldn't there be a new school of detectives?"
18:42;18:47;"The concept of policing is actually different than the concept of detecting."
18:47;18:49;"Couldn't we have just more Sherlock Holmeses?"
18:49;18:52;"-Wait, so what would they be doing? -Investigating."
18:52;18:55;"But aren't there already detectives that do that? I don't understand."
18:55;18:59;"What would the detectives do that they're not doing now?"
18:59;19:03;"There'd be more of them and there'd be different levels."
19:03;19:06;"The highest level being Sherlock Holmes for the best of the best."
19:06;19:08;"They'd be incentivized to do that."
19:08;19:15;"There's some smart nerd who's getting scooped up to go work in Silicon Valley,"
19:15;19:18;"starting salary $750,000 a year."
19:18;19:19;"Well, OK, we can't offer that."
19:19;19:23;"But what if we get starting salary $150,000"
19:23;19:26;"and you're a Sherlock Holmes level detective, unarmed,"
19:26;19:28;"but you help us keep these streets safe."
19:28;19:30;"You help us get to the bottom of stuff."
19:30;19:33;"We're not sending you in to go bother people."
19:33;19:36;"If somebody has an issue with, for instance,"
19:36;19:39;"we talked about the insanity, the absolute insanity"
19:39;19:43;"of sending armed police officers who are allowed to use violence"
19:43;19:47;"to investigate a counterfeit $20 bill in the case of George Flipp."
19:47;19:51;"Before you even get to the truly disgusting part of the killing of this man,"
19:51;19:53;"even just that in the first place,"
19:53;19:56;"who wants to live in a world where the cops come with their guns"
19:56;19:58;"to deal with a $20 bill?"
19:58;20:00;"Already, you're setting off a tense situation"
20:00;20:02;"or somebody selling loose cigarettes."
20:02;20:03;"There's a million examples."
20:03;20:08;"If a local store had an issue with counterfeiting,"
20:08;20:10;"send in the counterfeit dudes,"
20:10;20:12;"the counterfeit division of the Sherlock Holmeses."
20:12;20:16;"I actually want to get off this because I haven't thought this through enough"
20:16;20:18;"and I'm sure it could lead to all sorts of other problems."
20:18;20:20;"But actually, weirdly, you know the Secret Service"
20:20;20:22;"is in charge of dealing with counterfeiting, right?"
20:22;20:23;"Yes, I didn't know that."
20:23;20:25;"That also, though, just to throw it again,"
20:25;20:27;"is an example of how arbitrary it is."
20:28;20:29;"What is covered by it?"
20:30;20:32;"Yesterday"
20:32;20:38;"Anyway you made it was just fine"
20:38;20:45;"So you turned your days into night time"
20:45;20:48;"Didn't you know"
20:48;20:56;"You can't make it without ever even trying"
20:57;21:02;"And stop things on your way"
21:02;21:11;"Let these times show you that you're breaking up with me"
21:11;21:14;"It sounds like you're describing Batman, almost."
21:14;21:17;"No, no, no. Batman is a vigilante."
21:17;21:20;"He's a detective to an extent, though, isn't he?"
21:20;21:22;"Well, part of the problem with Batman is,"
21:22;21:27;"and I think why I increasingly see him moving down the rankings"
21:27;21:30;"of beloved American superheroes."
21:30;21:32;"Imagine I told you 20 years ago"
21:32;21:36;"that Iron Man and Hawkeye"
21:36;21:41;"would be as well known to the average American child as Batman."
21:41;21:43;"You would have looked at me like I was crazy."
21:43;21:45;"I would have been like, ""Who's Hawkeye?"""
21:45;21:46;"Exactly."
21:46;21:48;"All I'm saying is things have changed and I think part of it,"
21:48;21:51;"I even, there's a Twitter account now called Batman Slander."
21:52;21:53;"Have you seen this?"
21:53;21:55;"No. No."
21:55;21:57;"They just collect people making fun of Batman."
21:57;22:00;"The one that I remember, which, you know,"
22:00;22:04;"is sadly relevant in the crazy country we live in,"
22:04;22:08;"was the reason Batman's mask shows half his face,"
22:08;22:11;"is to let the cops know that he's white."
22:11;22:14;"So there's, you know, I think increasingly Batman in this era"
22:14;22:16;"is being seen as just a rich white guy"
22:16;22:19;"who's, you know, delivering vigilante justice."
22:20;22:22;"The most recent tweet from that account,"
22:22;22:25;"""Batman a billionaire practicing karate on the mentally ill."
22:25;22:27;"Call it what it is."""
22:27;22:29;"Oh my God. That's funny."
22:29;22:30;"There you go."
22:30;22:32;"If Batman's stock has fallen,"
22:32;22:35;"then our old friend Frank Castle, the Punisher,"
22:35;22:37;"has really fallen."
22:37;22:40;"Because he's just a vigilante."
22:40;22:42;"He doesn't even have like a fun animal costume."
22:42;22:46;"He's basically Charles Bronson in Death Wish,"
22:46;22:50;"but wearing like black spandex with that stupid skull on it."
22:50;22:51;"And just going around..."
22:51;22:53;"Looking back at those comics, it was just like..."
22:53;22:56;"Going around and just like killing criminals,"
22:56;23:01;"mostly of like color, when you look back on the comics."
23:01;23:03;"I've looked at them in years, but I can picture them."
23:03;23:07;"It comes from that same Death Wish, like, 70s New York milieu."
23:07;23:10;"Just like, ""These liberals down at City Hall,"
23:10;23:12;"they let this great city fall to sh*t."
23:12;23:15;"We gotta do something about it."""
23:15;23:17;"There's some racial undertones to that."
23:17;23:19;"I hate the way the Punisher logo..."
23:19;23:21;"I see it sometimes on gnarly pickup trucks"
23:21;23:23;"where the windows are all blacked out."
23:23;23:27;"Yeah, it's been co-opted by the Blue Lives Matter movement."
23:27;23:30;"It's kind of like a right-wing energy on Punisher."
23:30;23:32;"Which is a shame, because it used to be my favorite comic."
23:32;23:35;"Matt sent an article saying that the co-creator of Punisher"
23:35;23:39;"wants to reclaim the skull for Black Lives Matter."
23:39;23:41;"Interesting."
23:41;23:43;"Who's the co-creator of Punisher?"
23:43;23:45;"Jerry Conway."
23:45;23:48;"The character and symbol was never intended as a symbol of oppression."
23:48;23:50;"- I mean, he's one step above. - We should get him on the show."
23:50;23:53;"- Absolutely. - Oh, yeah."
23:53;23:55;"That's sick. Let's try to get him."
23:55;23:58;"Seinfeld, you were saying that in the Seinfeld 2000 community,"
23:58;24:02;"there hasn't particularly been a lot of pushback to your posts about..."
24:02;24:05;"I don't want to say police brutality, but addressing the situation."
24:05;24:09;"I didn't notice anything coming through the old TC mailbag,"
24:09;24:12;"unless there was something so dark that you chose not to forward it."
24:12;24:14;"Has it been pretty mellow on that front?"
24:14;24:16;"We didn't get any like, ""F*** you, Blue Lives Matter""?"
24:16;24:18;"- Not at all. - Well, that's tight."
24:18;24:22;"I do think the TC community is definitely going to be pretty level-headed."
24:22;24:24;"We have had emails from people before."
24:24;24:26;"Man, I can't remember what it was about,"
24:26;24:29;"but I remember we saw one that was from a detective in Tampa."
24:29;24:31;"It was unclear if he was on the force."
24:31;24:35;"I think it was when we were talking about the cops versus firefighters stuff."
24:35;24:37;"- Oh, yeah. Great email. - Yes, we had a lot of good emails,"
24:37;24:40;"including from people who had relatives in law enforcement."
24:40;24:43;"That guy said, ""I'm a detective in Tampa,"""
24:43;24:46;"which I just assumed if he was weighing in,"
24:46;24:49;"he was probably a detective for the Tampa police force."
24:49;24:51;"I guess he could have been a private eye."
24:51;24:55;"What an amazing self-description. ""I'm a detective in Tampa."""
24:55;24:58;"- Should we read that email? - Yeah, let's just bust that out."
24:58;25:00;"- Let's bust that out. - It's a short one."
25:00;25:02;"I can forward it to you, Ezra."
25:02;25:05;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
25:05;25:09;"He wrote, ""Hey, Ezra and Jake, I'm a big TChead/VampireWeekend fan."
25:09;25:13;"""Listen to TC tonight, and I heard your conversation about cops and firefighters."
25:13;25:17;"""I'm a detective in the St. Petersburg, Tampa, Florida area"
25:17;25:20;"""and may have a little insight into the relationship between cops and firefighters."
25:20;25:24;"""Clearly, we need to do some detective work of our own to understand what detectives are."""
25:24;25:30;"I look at that sentence again, and I'm like, ""Are you a cop?"""
25:30;25:35;"Obviously, he's talking about cops, but I could also imagine an independent detective being like,"
25:35;25:38;"""Listen, man, I've been all over St. Petersburg and Tampa."
25:38;25:42;"""Trust me, I see the cops, I see the firefighters, I know what their relationship is."""
25:42;25:46;"I could be wrong, but I think detective refers to an employee of the police department."
25:46;25:50;"I think if you're private, you're a private eye, right? But anyway, keep going."
25:50;25:53;"- You're a private detective. - Okay, yeah. I don't know."
25:53;25:59;"- Seems sketchy to-- Anyway. - I'm a Sherlock Holmes-type independent detective"
25:59;26:02;"in the St. Petersburg, Tampa, Florida area."
26:02;26:04;"Okay, so he said, ""You guys pretty much had it."
26:04;26:08;"""However, I'd say it's more of a friendly rivalry than animosity, at least in this area."""
26:08;26:10;"Down in the St. Pete, Tampa region."
26:10;26:13;"""Cops joke around about wishing they became firefighters instead of police."
26:13;26:16;"""For example, better public perception."""
26:16;26:20;"This is from a month ago. I mean, you said it, man."
26:20;26:22;"""Better public perception, better schedule,"
26:22;26:25;"""and you get paid to lounge around at the fire station waiting for a call."""
26:25;26:29;"- You got time to lean. You got time to clean. - You got time to clean."
26:29;26:33;"- I bet that's said in firehouses often. - Oh, my God."
26:33;26:35;"Fellas, fellas, come on."
26:35;26:39;"You think the firefighters are in charge of cleaning up the firehouse themselves?"
26:39;26:41;"- Yes. - Yes."
26:41;26:42;"- I think they are. - Yes."
26:42;26:45;"- 'Cause you got a lot of time. - You got a lot of time."
26:45;26:48;"""In the past, we've used the friendly rivalry to help the community."
26:48;26:51;"""For example, charity flag football games, etc."""
26:51;26:53;"I wonder if that's happening this year."
26:53;26:55;"""Love the show and music. Happy first birthday to Father DeBrog."
26:55;26:56;"""Can't wait for the next album."""
26:56;27:00;"Well, so anyway, this is-- We've always been kind of amazed"
27:01;27:05;"at all the different kinds of jobs and vibes that TC listeners have."
27:05;27:10;"Wouldn't have guessed that a detective in the St. Petersburg, Tampa, Florida area was ahead."
27:10;27:15;"But anyway, I wonder, I mean, Dallas, if you want to hit us back, if you listen to this,"
27:15;27:21;"so much of this whole conversation we've been having is the idea that police do too much."
27:21;27:24;"They use the wrong tools to enforce the wrong things."
27:24;27:26;"And there's got to be a better way."
27:26;27:28;"I think everybody could agree with that."
27:28;27:31;"And when you use the wrong tools to enforce the wrong thing,"
27:31;27:39;"you put-- Especially in a system that is so clearly built to oppress black people for hundreds of years,"
27:39;27:41;"of course, these are naturally going to happen."
27:41;27:46;"And as Alex Vitale said, he doesn't have a lot of faith that anti-bias training"
27:46;27:50;"is going to stop these incidents from happening when you still send cops with guns"
27:50;27:54;"to enforce unjust laws in communities that are already being oppressed."
27:54;27:58;"Anyway, so we talked about why are cops being asked to do all this stuff."
27:58;28:04;"And one question that I have is the concept of a detective versus a street enforcer,"
28:04;28:08;"you know, like when somebody else stops the thief, your job is to tackle them."
28:08;28:14;"You know, that job, whether or not that job should even exist, that's part of what we're talking about."
28:14;28:21;"But that versus being a detective whose job is to come in and use their powers of perception"
28:21;28:26;"and the scientific method to work backwards to understand what happened in a situation."
28:26;28:30;"It just seems like night and day, two different things."
28:30;28:35;"You know, like the detective, it's like an academic pursuit, kind of, you know?"
28:35;28:38;"Yeah, and you're trying to figure out something that occurred in the past,"
28:38;28:44;"whereas I guess the police officer on the street is dealing with something in real time."
28:44;28:46;"They're totally different situations."
28:46;28:50;"They're literally riding different waves of space-time."
28:50;28:52;"Yes."
28:52;28:57;"The idea that they should all be in the same organization barely makes any sense."
28:57;29:01;"So anyway, Dallas, if we have any other detectives listening,"
29:01;29:04;"I'm curious to really hear what you've got to say."
29:04;29:09;"And also I just want to understand what truly is the definition of a detective in the modern policing sense."
29:09;29:14;"This is a weirdly... What we're about to talk about and the person we're about to get on the phone"
29:14;29:19;"weirdly connects a lot of threads, recent pieces."
29:19;29:25;"One is the kind of political element of fighting the unjust machine"
29:25;29:31;"that brutalizes a lot of people, notably black and Hispanic people."
29:31;29:35;"Another thread that we've been talking about a lot over the past couple of months is"
29:35;29:37;"who is the greatest American band?"
29:37;29:40;"And we haven't actually mentioned this band that much."
29:40;29:42;"I think we've talked about them here in their own time, Chris,"
29:42;29:47;"but considering that this is like a very important band to me personally,"
29:47;29:49;"and I'm not sure about you, Jake, I'm interested to hear,"
29:49;29:52;"but we haven't talked about this band that much and that band is Rage Against the Machine."
29:52;29:56;"And they've been back in the news even though they're not exactly active."
29:56;30:00;"They were going to do some shows this year, but obviously it's not happening."
30:00;30:03;"A lot of people were talking about them because you saw..."
30:03;30:07;"Anybody who's familiar with Rage Against the Machine wouldn't be surprised to know that"
30:07;30:12;"the members feel passionately about stopping police brutality"
30:12;30:15;"and exposing the unjust system for what it is."
30:15;30:19;"But as Tom Morello, the guitarist, has been posting a lot,"
30:19;30:23;"he got some comments from people, one that notably said..."
30:23;30:25;"I'm going to need to look up the exact comment,"
30:25;30:26;"but he got a comment that people were passing around,"
30:26;30:30;"somebody went like, ""You know what, man? You're one of my favorite artists,"
30:30;30:32;"but I've got to tell you, I've had it up to here with the politics, man."
30:32;30:35;"Stick to the music. You're about to lose a lot of your fan base"
30:35;30:37;"if you keep going on about this."""
30:37;30:41;"And of every band, any band that exists in the world,"
30:41;30:45;"Rage Against the Machine is maybe the most absurd band to tell, ""Stick to the music."""
30:45;30:48;"And there is something about Rage Against the Machine"
30:48;30:50;"that maybe just because they rock so well,"
30:50;30:53;"they've always appealed to a broad audience,"
30:53;30:57;"you know, including... What's his name? Who's the..."
30:57;30:58;"- Paul Ryan, right? - Paul Ryan."
30:58;31:01;"- Paul Ryan was a big fan. - He famously said they're his favorite band."
31:01;31:06;"I think people said, ""Well, you're this right-wing psychopath."
31:06;31:09;"How do you reconcile that?"" He was just like,"
31:09;31:11;"""You know, I just focus on the music,"" or something like that."
31:11;31:14;"Anyway, unfortunately, even the most political music"
31:14;31:17;"can be reduced to just a good groove."
31:17;31:23;"I'm picturing Paul Ryan at 5 in the morning doing like insane ab workout."
31:23;31:27;"Just doing like a 4-minute plank and just like blasting, killing in the name."
31:27;31:30;"- Just yelling. - Easy to picture."
31:30;31:34;"Anyway, to talk about Rage, we're going to get a journalist"
31:34;31:36;"who I've known for a long time on the phone."
31:36;31:39;"His name is Jonah Weiner, and he's..."
31:40;31:43;"When I first met him, I think he profiled Vampire Weekend for Blender,"
31:43;31:46;"where he interviewed us back in 2008."
31:46;31:49;"And he's currently a contributing writer at New York Times Magazine,"
31:49;31:52;"and he also writes for Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, and Slate."
31:52;31:56;"And I linked up with him again to do an interview for his new newsletter,"
31:56;31:58;"which is called Blackbird Spy Plane."
31:58;32:03;"And Blackbird Spy Plane is kind of about clothes and fashion,"
32:03;32:07;"and he recently also had like a very rare Andre 3000 interview, which was tight."
32:08;32:12;"That's a very cool newsletter. But anyway, he recently did a piece"
32:12;32:16;"for Blackbird Spy Plane about a Rage Against the Machine shirt."
32:16;32:20;"And he's a big fan, so he's a perfect person to talk to in this moment."
32:20;32:21;"So let's get Jonah on the horn."
32:21;32:24;"Did you see Jonah's recent viral tweet?"
32:24;32:27;"- Oh, yeah, of the... - The plywood."
32:27;32:30;"So weird. We got to ask him about that as well."
32:30;32:34;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
32:37;32:40;"- What's up? - Jonah, welcome to Time Crisis."
32:40;32:44;"- Thanks for having me. - So Seinfeld just reminded us that,"
32:44;32:48;"before we talk about Rage Against the Machine, that you recently had a viral tweet."
32:48;32:50;"I guess it's turning some heads in the viral tweet community,"
32:50;32:52;"of which Seinfeld is a prominent member."
32:52;32:59;"You were walking around and saw a boarded up storefront,"
32:59;33:02;"and upon closer examination, it wasn't boarded up at all."
33:02;33:08;"They had printed out wood-textured looking paper and just taped it to the front."
33:08;33:11;"It was like as though they had done a Google image search for plywood"
33:11;33:17;"and found the lowest res image possible, and then printed it out really, really big"
33:17;33:19;"on taped together printer paper."
33:19;33:21;"But it worked, so it was on a side street."
33:21;33:25;"I'm not going to blow up their spot and identify details"
33:25;33:27;"in case anyone wants to go cause trouble."
33:27;33:29;"So I'll try and keep it vague."
33:29;33:31;"But basically off a main street in Oakland."
33:31;33:34;"It's kind of like up a side street so you can see it from the main street."
33:34;33:37;"But from that distance, it really did look convincingly like plywood."
33:37;33:40;"And actually, I have to give credit, because I was out for a walk with Erin, my girlfriend,"
33:40;33:43;"and we walked right by it. We walked down the side street,"
33:43;33:46;"and I didn't notice at all. And she was like, ""Hold up. This is paper."""
33:46;33:51;"- Whoa. And it was just taped to the window, or was it like taped to a sheet of cardboard?"
33:51;33:55;"- Best I could tell, it was like, maybe they put like some cardboard in between."
33:55;34:01;"But yeah, if you look at it, like there's still like white outlines on each piece of printer paper."
34:01;34:04;"So they didn't do a particularly seamless job."
34:04;34:06;"Yeah, it was pretty cool. The tweet did big numbers."
34:06;34:10;"The most satisfying one was probably a William Gibson retweet,"
34:10;34:14;"because it was a very William Gibson thing to bump into on the street."
34:14;34:17;"And so I was glad that he saw it and validated it with a retweet."
34:17;34:23;"- So I guess first things first, because we didn't really talk too much about Rage"
34:23;34:26;"before you got on the phone. I think we just got to talk about Rage Against the Machine."
34:26;34:27;"- Yes."
34:27;34:31;"- They haven't come up in our discussions about the greatest American band."
34:31;34:34;"But as soon as I started thinking about Rage Against the Machine,"
34:34;34:37;"they'd become like a top five band for me."
34:37;34:43;"I don't know if I've talked about it on the show, but that was one of the first bands that I was like, just really into."
34:43;34:48;"Like I remember getting Evil Empire and then going backwards and getting the first album."
34:48;34:50;"Just a few quick anecdotes."
34:50;34:54;"I think when I was like 11 or something, I was in middle school."
34:54;34:57;"I was running for... It wasn't President."
34:57;35:01;"I think if you were in seventh grade, you could run for President. Maybe I was in sixth grade."
35:01;35:03;"So I was running for Vice President or something."
35:03;35:06;"And you could put up posters for your candidacy."
35:06;35:11;"And I really wanted to make a Rage Against the Machine Vice President poster."
35:11;35:15;"When I think back to this campaign, I had no platform whatsoever."
35:15;35:20;"I do remember that the guy I was running against, Dusty Salzano,"
35:20;35:25;"part of his platform was having McDonald's Day in the cafeteria."
35:25;35:27;"And I just couldn't compete with that."
35:27;35:30;"I probably did a little bit of like, ""And how are you going to pay for it?"" kind of sh*t."
35:30;35:33;"But you know, I remember his platform better than mine."
35:33;35:37;"But anyway, I did have one really good poster because I asked my mom to help me."
35:37;35:42;"And she recreated the Evil Empire."
35:42;35:45;"I don't know what I was going for here, but she recreated the Evil Empire album cover,"
35:45;35:51;"which is a boy wearing this kind of like almost like superhero outfit with his hair slick."
35:51;35:55;"So she drew the Evil Empire cover and made it look more like me."
35:55;35:57;"And I think he had an E on his chest."
35:57;35:59;"And you know, my name's Ezra."
35:59;36:02;"So anyway, I was really repping Rage Against the Machine,"
36:02;36:05;"not in a deep way, but in a middle school way."
36:05;36:07;"And, you know, the people made their choice."
36:07;36:09;"They had me and my Rage Against the Machine campaign."
36:09;36:14;"They had Dusty Salzano and McDonald's in the cafeteria and he won."
36:14;36:17;"And I think, you know, he did one day of McDonald's in the cafeteria."
36:17;36:19;"And, you know, who cares? What was the point of that?"
36:19;36:21;"So anyway, I was a big fan."
36:21;36:25;"I think the only fan club I've ever joined was the Rage Against the Machine fan club."
36:25;36:28;"I filled something out that came with the CD."
36:28;36:32;"And I remember once getting like a fan club 7-inch in the mail from Rage."
36:32;36:35;"It was their cover of the Bruce Springsteen song Ghost of Tom Jode."
36:35;36:39;"Yeah, I was like, wow, thank you, Rage Against the Machine."
36:39;36:41;"This is why I joined your fan club."
36:41;36:44;"And then, you know, I probably didn't think about them too much"
36:44;36:46;"because they were pretty inactive for a while."
36:46;36:50;"But in the early Vampire Weekend days, we were touring probably our first album"
36:50;36:53;"and they were doing kind of a reunion festival run."
36:53;36:56;"And we watched them side stage at a festival in Portugal."
36:56;37:02;"And I just remember them watching them coming out, the crowd just like up and down,"
37:02;37:03;"hands in the air, so hardcore."
37:03;37:05;"And just watching them bust out hit after hit."
37:05;37:07;"And I just remember watching them and thinking,"
37:07;37:10;"they're like the Led Zeppelin of America."
37:10;37:17;"In that they use the same scale to do these like pentatonic riffs over and over again."
37:17;37:22;"And yet, as similar as the songs are, they're all still feel so different."
37:22;37:26;"Like every time they kicked into a new song, I was just like, oh, sh*t."
37:26;37:28;"And I was just so blown away by their catalog."
37:28;37:31;"And they only really have three albums, three albums plus a covers album."
37:31;37:36;"So I remember being there side stage in whenever that was, 2008, 2009."
37:36;37:38;"I remember being like, I love this band."
37:38;37:43;"This is why I was right as a kid to like be down with Rage."
37:43;37:44;"Because they are kind of the best."
38:40;38:45;"So anyway, I want to ask you guys, I guess start with you, Jake."
38:45;38:46;"Are you a Rage fan?"
38:47;38:57;"Yeah, I remember being at a tape world in a mall in '92 or '93 and having enough money for one album"
38:57;39:03;"and having to decide between Soul Asylum, Grave Dancer's Union and the first Rage."
39:03;39:04;"I went Rage."
39:04;39:11;"Interesting, because in some ways Soul Asylum seems to cue a little closer to your kind of indie rock taste."
39:11;39:12;"That is true."
39:12;39:14;"Rage is powerful, man."
39:14;39:22;"And on cross-country meets, we'd be in the school bus and there'd be the older kids in the back of the bus with the huge boombox"
39:22;39:25;"blasting tunes before the meet."
39:25;39:31;"And it was like heavy Rage first record and heavy Metallica and Justice For All."
39:31;39:32;"Heavy music."
39:32;39:33;"Yeah, interesting."
39:33;39:35;"So that's how I got turned on to Rage."
39:35;39:40;"And yeah, I mean, I remember learning how to play those riffs, bomb track and stuff."
39:40;39:41;"Anytime I pick up a bass..."
39:42;39:45;"[sings]"
39:45;39:46;"Yeah."
39:46;39:49;"I didn't explore their catalog after that record."
39:49;39:51;"You didn't get Evil Empire?"
39:51;39:55;"No, and I know I heard what you were saying about like every song."
39:55;39:57;"It's probably my own shortcoming."
39:57;40:02;"Like to me, it was sort of like I heard bomb track and Killing In The Name track one and two on their first record."
40:02;40:05;"And I was like, I'm good after those two songs."
40:05;40:07;"Like are there Rage ballads?"
40:07;40:10;"I like them in small doses is what I'm saying."
40:11;40:14;"It's a very narrow aesthetic and they absolutely destroy it."
40:14;40:15;"I know what you mean."
40:15;40:17;"And also, that's a great point."
40:17;40:24;"I mean, well, first of all, we just got to say coming out the gate, beginning your career, track one and track two."
40:24;40:25;"Oh, yeah."
40:25;40:28;"Bomb track and Killing In The Name of just I mean, come on."
40:28;40:28;"Insane."
40:28;40:33;"And also I think you've identified something that's like, it's almost like the curse of being too good."
40:33;40:40;"If the core idea of a band is like so perfectly expressed in a handful of songs."
40:40;40:53;"It's like unless you're willing to broaden your power to go into like a ballad or like, you know, if Rage Against The Machine was like on a different track, like, yeah, they would have made like an Americana album at some point."
40:53;40:57;"They would start to get it like, like Trent Reznor would have produced their fourth album."
40:57;40:58;"Right."
40:58;40:59;"They go full industrial."
40:59;41:00;"No, I respect it."
41:00;41:01;"I respect it."
41:01;41:05;"There's an 808s and Heartbreak album where it's just like, yeah, Zach didn't want to rap."
41:05;41:07;"And Tom put down the guitar."
41:07;41:09;"He was on the Korg the whole time."
41:09;41:12;"Yeah, so there is something about it's like the curse of just being too damn good."
41:12;41:16;"So Jonah, were you a massive Rage fan back in the day?"
41:16;41:16;"Yeah, totally."
41:16;41:17;"I mean, same."
41:17;41:22;"I didn't actually as good of a story as yours with like your mom making the Evil Empire poster."
41:22;41:26;"But yeah, they were like my favorite band."
41:26;41:37;"Super heavy for probably like two years or so kind of coming off the first album in the lead up to Evil Empire and my first concert besides catching Arlo Guthrie when I was a little kid with my parents was actually."
41:38;41:46;"It's actually harmonious that my two first concert, Arlo Guthrie was my first concert period and then my first like unaccompanied concert was Rage."
41:46;41:50;"So I kept it left, you know, I kept it counterculture, socially progressive counterculture."
41:50;41:58;"It was the Rage Wu-Tang show at the Metal Land in 1997 was like the first concert I was allowed to go to with friends and it was so much fun."
41:58;42:06;"I was a tiny bit young for that, but I do remember hearing about kids from my town going to that show on the ill-fated Rage Wu-Tang tour."
42:06;42:09;"And also we should point out you're from Staten Island."
42:09;42:09;"That's right."
42:09;42:12;"So that must have been just a dream come true."
42:12;42:15;"It was hometown heroes Wu-Tang plus your favorite rock band."
42:15;42:16;"That's right."
42:16;42:23;"I wonder if we have any listeners who aren't that familiar with Rage because the thing about them is like they're so iconic to a generation."
42:23;42:36;"But part of the reason why maybe they don't come up much in the endlessly debated best American band conversation that clearly has captured the cultural imagination of America for the almost all of 2020 is because they're not prolific at all."
42:36;42:39;"Three albums and a covers album."
42:39;42:45;"It's three albums that almost feels like less to the extent that, as you said, they're kind of like drilling in."
42:45;42:53;"It's kind of the same song or like a very tight set of parameters that they're just kind of refining and drilling into over the course of those three albums."
42:53;42:55;"So it's almost like they put out one song."
42:55;43:09;"And it's also like if I think back to our conversation with Stephen Hyden and me droning on about the fourth album being a classic pivot moment or like a moment to kind of expand the parameters for bands or any artist really."
43:09;43:18;"One interesting thing about a band that never puts out more than three records, they come right up to the edge of that place where you need to start trying new things."
43:18;43:24;"And I'm not saying they didn't try new things in each one, but it's like those three records have a very specific Rage sound."
43:25;43:31;"And it's amazing that there's so much good material on all three, but they're really one A, one B and one C."
43:31;43:33;"Anyway, they weren't prolific."
43:33;43:39;"So there's probably a generation of people who may be their parents like them or, you know, probably heard something."
43:39;43:42;"Bomb Track is on Rock Band or Guitar Hero or something."
43:42;43:52;"So maybe, Jonah, you could contextualize Rage Against the Machine, first album, where that sat culturally, when it came out, the album cover."
43:53;43:55;"Just talk about that album and that moment."
43:55;43:56;"Yes."
43:56;44:03;"I mean, they get situated in, I guess, you know, this all rock thing that's happening in the early 90s."
44:03;44:07;"They come out of Los Angeles, the hardcore scene, right?"
44:07;44:08;"Zach Taylor Richards and this band."
44:08;44:10;"What was it called? Inside Out?"
44:10;44:12;"That's kind of like where he cool."
44:12;44:13;"Like I wasn't into them."
44:13;44:22;"But I remember when I got into like for a minute, if you were like big into Rage Against the Machine, like and you were talking to like maybe like an older kid who was trying to put you on the game."
44:22;44:26;"He'd say, oh, well, you know, if you want to listen to the real shit, you got to listen to Inside Out."
44:26;44:27;"So much better."
44:27;44:29;"So they come out of the hardcore scene."
44:29;44:49;"But I guess because like alt rock radio as a format was so popular and kind of, you know, coming off the success of Nevermind, like just bands are getting signed up who have that kind of like loud, quiet thing, which Rage Against the Machine, like broadly speaking, do have that kind of dynamic song to song where the verses, you know, where he's rapping, get a little quiet and a little louder in the chorus."
44:49;45:07;"They this kind of wild thing happens where this explicitly communist, you know, half rap, half rock group gets signed to a major label and then goes on to sell a zillion copies because I think the sound is so it just functions on like the brute level of just like gym music."
45:07;45:09;"Like you don't really need to be listening to what they're saying."
45:09;45:15;"It just kind of works sonically as such like this high energy kind of experience that they sell a lot."
45:15;45:23;"And, yeah, the cover of that album just that said, you couldn't really ignore that it was a photograph of a man on fire, which I remember my mom explaining to me at the time."
45:23;45:25;"I was like, what is this photo? And she recognized it."
45:25;45:36;"She's like, I have this this Buddhist monk setting himself on fire in Vietnam in protest of oppression of Buddhists by the government kind of early days of Vietnam War."
45:37;45:39;"Everybody should look at the self-titled Ridge album cover."
45:39;45:41;"It's a disturbing image."
45:41;45:53;"When I think about like how much stuff got like censored back in the day, the fact that this image of truly a man dying, he was protesting the US backed regime in Vietnam."
45:53;45:57;"So, you know, that symbol obviously he was protesting his own government."
45:57;45:59;"He's also protesting American imperialism."
45:59;46:11;"So to have an image that violent of a person on fire, there's something about it being black and white that maybe take some of like the aestheticizes it in a way makes the image."
46:11;46:11;"I don't know."
46:11;46:19;"We got to like call Susan Sontag or something, but there's something about the black and white version and the way they have it kind of grainy on the album cover."
46:19;46:26;"I guess the average American kid in the early 90s could be forgiven for seeing that and just almost think it's a collage or something."
46:26;46:27;"Right."
46:27;46:39;"But to really think about that, that one of the most important American rock bands of the 90s came on the scene with that image, an image like so violent and so tied into the history of our country is really intense."
46:39;46:42;"I bet there's a lot of people clearly the Paul Rhynes of the world."
46:42;46:48;"Nobody explained it to them before we start talking about Rage's merch, which I really want to get into."
46:48;46:58;"I do just want to listen a little bit to Killing in the Name of because it's interesting to me that like, you know, it always happens with bands that they have a lot of great songs."
46:58;47:07;"Like for me, because I kind of got in on the second album, I'll always just remember hearing like Bulls on Parade for the first time and Bulls on Parade like really stuck with me."
47:07;47:14;"But clearly now that the dust is settled, almost 30 years later, Killing in the Name of is so clearly like the Rage song."
47:14;47:19;"There's a while where I feel like it was getting played in clubs a lot."
47:19;47:22;"It was sort of like 2008 or so or maybe a little bit later."
47:22;47:36;"But like whenever Ed Banger and Justice were happening, one of the producers in the Ed Banger crew actually did a cover of Killing in the Name, like super crunchy synthesizers and maybe like a vocoder vocal."
47:36;47:38;"Maybe it's even like a robot voice doing all the vocals."
47:39;47:47;"And they would like close out these wild like Ed Banger parties and then probably other DJs started playing as well, like with that."
47:47;47:55;"And it was just like, whereas you might be dancing to like Justice and Daft Punk like a half hour earlier, it would just become a mosh pit."
47:55;47:56;"I wonder if that's what you're thinking of."
47:56;47:59;"To Killing in the Name of. Yeah, because that feels like the right moment, that kind of Ed Banger era."
48:09;48:15;"Also, I love this song is so like prog, just like cowbell."
48:15;48:16;"Yeah."
48:27;48:32;"I remember my high school cross country coach was just like, you guys, you got to turn that off."
48:32;48:33;"Really?"
48:33;48:37;"Well, he gets to the end of the song and he's just like, F you."
48:41;48:44;"You have so many parts to this song."
48:46;48:49;"Like it's way different if they just open the song with that."
48:49;48:51;"They easily could have."
49:03;49:08;"Also, an amazing thing about this song is that there's like seven lines."
49:08;49:11;"It's a minimalist poem."
49:22;49:26;"Yeah, I mean, he really is like the perfect vocalist for this band."
49:29;49:31;"New part."
49:31;49:33;"I love this song is so minimalist."
49:44;49:47;"It's almost like a YouTube group, like Joshua Tree."
50:04;50:05;"Okay, pause it."
50:05;50:08;"So anyway, just to go through it, it is crazy."
50:08;50:12;"Like even knowing this music pretty well, just to kind of like return to it."
50:12;50:16;"It's unbelievable the extent to which this music was popular,"
50:16;50:19;"like with just like all sorts of like meatheads and stuff."
50:19;50:21;"Because if you actually look at the lyrics,"
50:21;50:24;"each section is basically one line repeated over and over again."
50:24;50:25;"So the verse is,"
50:25;50:29;"""Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses."""
50:29;50:31;"I bet when I was a kid, I didn't understand what he was really saying."
50:31;50:33;"I could hear the burn crosses part,"
50:33;50:36;"but maybe it's because of the kind of strange wording of"
50:36;50:38;"""some of those that work forces."""
50:38;50:40;"I'm sure I had no idea what that meant."
50:40;50:41;"Right."
50:41;50:43;"And what he's saying there is,"
50:43;50:47;"""Some people who work in law enforcement are the same people in the KKK."""
50:47;50:50;"He's like drawing a very explicit connection"
50:50;50:53;"between an overtly white supremacist organization"
50:53;50:59;"and people who join the police force as a way of upholding white supremacy."
50:59;51:01;"Then the next part is, ""Killing in the name of,"""
51:01;51:03;"and then, ""Now you do what they told you."""
51:03;51:04;"And he says it over and over again."
51:04;51:07;"I mean, it's kind of like slam poetry or something."
51:07;51:10;"Just these very simple ideas, over and over again,"
51:10;51:12;"just kind of building."
51:12;51:16;"Jake, like you said, he has such an unusual voice."
51:16;51:21;"It's always kind of strange when you hear him pop up here and there on rap songs."
51:21;51:25;"And he does this thing, but it just shouldn't work so well."
51:25;51:26;"Yeah."
51:26;51:29;"In the late '90s, when there was the nu metal revival,"
51:29;51:31;"which is rap rock, basically,"
51:31;51:33;"and a lot of people talked about, ""Well, the forefathers of this,"""
51:33;51:37;"of course, you could talk about Aerosmith and Run-DMC doing a one-off song,"
51:37;51:40;"but really, the forefathers would be like the Beastie Boys,"
51:40;51:42;"who were rapping over Zeppelin,"
51:42;51:43;"and then Rage Against the Machine."
51:43;51:45;"That was truly the synthesis."
51:45;51:48;"Then you look at all that stuff, and I'll defend some of it."
51:48;51:51;"I think Limp Bizkit had some jams here and there."
51:51;51:53;"I think it's unfairly maligned."
51:53;51:54;"Even Kid Rock did his thing here and there."
51:54;51:57;"But truly, Rage kind of invented something,"
51:57;52:00;"and nobody ever came close to doing it as well as them."
52:00;52:02;"Not even in the ballpark."
52:02;52:03;"Not even in the ballpark."
52:03;52:05;"Like, Black Sabbath, they invented something,"
52:05;52:08;"and it became gigantic."
52:08;52:10;"The branches of the metal tree are endless."
52:10;52:14;"Rage invented something, and it died after them."
52:14;52:17;"Well, it's like we said, it's a very narrow aesthetic."
52:17;52:19;"Right. And if anything changes,"
52:19;52:22;"the voice, the guitar tone, it just falls apart."
52:22;52:24;"Yeah. Fred Durst's voice sucks."
52:24;52:26;"I mean, Kid Rock sucks."
52:26;52:28;"[LAUGHTER]"
52:28;52:31;"It's amazing that Zach DiLaRoccia met Tom Morello,"
52:31;52:32;"and kind of what you said,"
52:32;52:35;"it just fits together like a puzzle piece or something."
52:35;52:37;"Because Zach and some other band,"
52:37;52:41;"if Zach's auditioning to be in some grunge band,"
52:41;52:44;"some sort of STP style band,"
52:44;52:46;"it might have been fine."
52:46;52:51;"Just alternate universe where instead of Eddie Vedder in San Diego,"
52:51;52:53;"sending his tape to Pearl Jam,"
52:53;52:55;"somehow some dudes like,"
52:55;52:57;"I know this really interesting guy,"
52:57;52:58;"he kind of raps, and then like,"
52:58;53:01;"mother love bone dudes up in Seattle are kind of like,"
53:01;53:03;"all right, Zach, fly up, man."
53:03;53:04;"Let's give it a try."
53:04;53:05;"We'll give it a shot, man."
53:05;53:07;"Doesn't quite work."
53:07;53:09;"But, I mean, Jonah,"
53:09;53:12;"do you have any perspective on this just to focus on that first verse?"
53:12;53:16;"Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses."
53:16;53:20;"Like, this was just getting played all over the radio and MTV in the early '90s."
53:20;53:24;"Like, was there a big law enforcement pushback against Rage at this time?"
53:24;53:26;"Yeah, that's a really good question,"
53:26;53:28;"because they're operating in that like,"
53:28;53:30;"tipper gore, parental advisory,"
53:30;53:31;"like, super kind of, you know,"
53:31;53:33;"active Christian right boycott era."
53:33;53:36;"And for some reason, maybe, I don't know,"
53:36;53:39;"I don't associate them with any of those campaigns in any big way."
53:39;53:41;"Like, the way you think about like,"
53:41;53:44;"Two Live Crew as being synonymous with, you know,"
53:44;53:47;"censorship and family values campaign."
53:47;53:50;"Like, it didn't really attach to Rage Against the Machine in the same way."
53:50;53:53;"I'm sure there was that attention on them, but it somehow did not."
53:53;54:00;"Maybe because there was no sexually explicit stuff that the Christians would get all fired up about."
54:00;54:03;"And it was like, their politics were, you know, extreme left,"
54:03;54:06;"but there was no threat to the power structures."
54:06;54:08;"They were on a major label."
54:08;54:09;"And so I could see them just being like,"
54:09;54:11;"""Oh, these punks are like, talking about..."""
54:11;54:14;"And also, I guess if you compare it to, like,"
54:14;54:19;"it's not a very subtle idea to be telling the youth of America,"
54:19;54:22;"""Listen, guys, there are literally cops right now."
54:22;54:26;"They're going to police black neighborhoods who also are members of the KKK."""
54:26;54:28;"It's an intense idea. It's not a subtle idea."
54:28;54:29;"It's like, ""Listen, guys."""
54:29;54:33;"But even so, there's something about the way it comes across in the music."
54:33;54:35;"It's good art, you know, and for better or worse,"
54:35;54:39;"sometimes when it's really good, it becomes like, hypnotic and like, vibey."
54:39;54:42;"And you compare it to, no disrespect, but like,"
54:42;54:46;"I would say probably like, a lesser piece of music like Ice-T, Cop Killer."
54:46;54:49;"But Ice-T, who is a very interesting artist,"
54:49;54:52;"he's so straight up, the song's called Cop Killer."
54:52;54:54;"And that freaked the shit out of people."
54:54;54:56;"That actually was a huge moment."
54:56;55:00;"That even led to, like, I think Time Warner, like, selling the label."
55:00;55:02;"It really got crazy there."
55:02;55:05;"But anyway, it doesn't seem like that happened with Rage Against the Machine,"
55:05;55:08;"even though their ideas are arguably like, more provocative."
55:08;55:10;"And I'm not dissing Ice-T."
55:10;55:13;"I actually haven't spent a lot of time with that song any time recently."
55:13;55:17;"But in some ways, what Rage Against the Machine was like saying in the song"
55:17;55:19;"was almost more provocative."
55:19;55:21;"And then, you know, to keep going through the song,"
55:21;55:23;"then now you do what they told you."
55:23;55:27;"Did you guys know about this moment at Lollapalooza?"
55:27;55:28;"No, what's that?"
55:28;55:36;"Where they specifically went out to protest and combat Tipper Gore and the PMRC."
55:36;55:39;"So, the parental guidance."
55:39;55:46;"Is that I guess in '93, they had a 15-minute set at Lollapalooza in Philadelphia."
55:46;55:48;"And it was a 15-minute set."
55:48;55:49;"So, this was early."
55:49;55:50;"They had 15 minutes."
55:50;55:52;"They showed up."
55:52;55:55;"And Zack had lost his voice."
55:55;55:59;"And so, rather than perform but not wanting to give up the set,"
55:59;56:04;"they basically wrote the parental, the PMRC on them, taped their mouths up,"
56:04;56:07;"and just went out naked and stood there for 15 minutes."
56:07;56:09;"Oh, I can kind of picture that."
56:09;56:12;"And it was specifically--"
56:12;56:13;"Kind of chilly."
56:13;56:15;"And they said, ""We shouldn't play this show."
56:15;56:17;"We should protest it."""
56:17;56:18;"So, interesting."
56:18;56:19;"""We should have everything going on."""
56:19;56:20;"So, yeah."
56:20;56:21;"So, they were definitely in the mix."
56:21;56:25;"And then the chorus is, ""Those who died are justified for wearing the badge."
56:25;56:26;"They're the chosen whites."""
56:26;56:28;"He says that over and over again."
56:28;56:31;"Every section of the song is a very simple phrase repeated."
56:31;56:34;"Even now looking at it, it's crazy to think what a lot--"
56:34;56:38;"I mean, obviously, these days we're reminded over and over again"
56:38;56:41;"that very little has changed in this country."
56:41;56:46;"People who have said something 30, 60, 90 years ago, it's often still valid."
56:46;56:49;"So, he's saying, ""Those who died are justified for wearing the badge."
56:49;56:51;"They're the chosen whites."""
56:51;56:53;"I don't think I knew that that's exactly what the line was."
56:53;56:54;"""Those who died are justified."""
56:54;56:59;"I vaguely understood that, which is, I think, the idea that if a cop kills you,"
56:59;57:00;"it's justified."
57:00;57:04;"I mean, clearly, this is an issue that hasn't stopped mattering."
57:04;57:08;"People see a cop do something that they interpret as murder,"
57:08;57:11;"and they want to see the cop charged with murder,"
57:11;57:18;"but there's a million legal reasons and cultural reasons why that rarely happens."
57:18;57:21;"So, ""Those who died are justified for wearing the badge."
57:21;57:22;"They're the chosen whites."""
57:22;57:24;"Kind of like weird phrasing, but he's basically saying,"
57:24;57:27;"""If you wear the badge, you can kill somebody, and it's justified."""
57:27;57:29;"But then, ""They're the chosen whites."""
57:29;57:34;"That's really intense, just drawing this really clear-cut thing"
57:34;57:38;"that the white cops are often white supremacists,"
57:38;57:41;"and they're legally allowed to murder people"
57:41;57:44;"in a way that you think you wouldn't accept."
57:44;57:45;"There's a lot of probably Americans who would say,"
57:45;57:47;"""Well, should the KKK be allowed to kill whoever they want?"""
57:47;57:48;"No, of course not."
57:48;57:51;"But he's making this point that there's something similar"
57:51;57:55;"when a power structure is so violent and oppressive and racist."
57:55;57:59;"Anyway, to look at all this stuff now, in this current moment,"
57:59;58:02;"when you revisit the words of what they were saying"
58:02;58:06;"and how purposeful they were, repeating the words over and over again,"
58:06;58:11;"this is not the same as somebody singing ""Imagine"" at a Christmas pageant"
58:11;58:13;"and changing the words about religion,"
58:13;58:15;"and somebody being like, ""That's pretty ironic,"""
58:15;58:18;"when you consider that John Lennon absolutely would not have stood"
58:18;58:19;"for what you stand for."
58:19;58:21;"That comes up a lot, where somebody's like,"
58:21;58:24;"""You don't understand that the politics of that artist,"
58:24;58:26;"what they were actually trying to say in that song,"
58:26;58:27;"isn't what you think."""
58:27;58:29;"This isn't that."
58:29;58:32;"Everything about this music is pointing in the direction"
58:32;58:34;"of basically saying, ""F*** you."""
58:34;58:37;"Reflecting on these lyrics, it's even crazier that this is just like,"
58:37;58:40;"it became a fun song to mosh to at a dance club, too."
58:40;58:42;"It's pretty wild."
58:42;58:43;"It's kind of a long song."
58:43;58:44;"We don't have to listen to the whole thing, but--"
58:44;58:45;"Go to the end."
58:45;58:48;"Yeah, go to the end, because there's the sick guitar solo,"
58:48;58:50;"and then there's the legendary outro."
58:50;58:51;"Yeah."
58:51;59:12;"♪"
59:12;59:14;"♪ I'll do whatever you do with your time, babe ♪"
59:14;59:16;"It's going full free jazz."
59:16;59:21;"♪"
59:21;59:23;"Dude, drumming is sick."
59:23;59:25;"Yeah, everybody in the band is awesome."
59:25;59:29;"I mean, I think the sad truth is a lot of angry white kids--"
59:29;59:30;"Sure."
59:30;59:32;"--listen to the first half of the song,"
59:32;59:35;"and really identify with that lyric, this lyric."
59:35;59:37;"♪"
59:37;59:39;"No matter how idiotic your worldview is,"
59:39;59:41;"everyone can own a f***ing--"

59:43;59:44;"I think, actually, now that I'm hearing this,"
59:44;59:47;"I feel like I brought this in as a reference"
59:47;59:51;"for a Vampire Weekend song, California English."
59:51;59:53;"♪ Bum, bum, bum, dun, dun, dun, dun ♪"
59:53;59:54;"We just had a little--"
59:54;59:55;"Oh, yeah."

59:56;59:58;"♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, bum, bum, bum ♪"
59:58;01:00:00;"But, yeah, you can totally imagine somebody listening"
01:00:00;01:00:02;"and being like, some of those in armed forces, like,"
01:00:02;01:00:03;"I don't totally understand what this means,"
01:00:03;01:00:05;"and just kind of waiting."
01:00:05;01:00:07;"It's like classic when you only know part of a song,"
01:00:07;01:00:09;"you're kind of waiting through the verses."
01:00:09;01:00:12;"♪ F*** you, I won't do what you tell me ♪"
01:00:12;01:00:15;"It's the clearest line in the whole song."
01:00:15;01:00:17;"So you can just imagine somebody--"
01:00:17;01:00:18;"I guess that's an issue, like,"
01:00:18;01:00:22;"good protest music can just feel like anti-authority s***,"
01:00:22;01:00:25;"which, you know, the number of people who are anti-authority"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"is way larger than the number of people"
01:00:27;01:00:31;"who are, like, anti-police brutality, unfortunately."
01:00:31;01:00:34;"Right, they definitely also started doing--"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"like, this video, I think, was just live footage,"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"but the video for ""Freedom"" was actually the first time"
01:00:38;01:00:40;"I think I ever heard ""Rage Against the Machine,"""
01:00:40;01:00:43;"and that was basically like a mini-documentary"

01:00:48;01:00:51;"and Leonard Pelletier on a reservation."
01:00:51;01:00:55;"And I guess that they maybe-- from then on,"
01:00:55;01:00:56;"even, like, with ""Bullseye Parade,"""
01:00:56;01:00:58;"I guess it got slightly more abstract"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"with their, like, Barbara Kruger images,"
01:01:00;01:01:01;"but they started using their videos"
01:01:01;01:01:04;"to maybe hammer the point home that much more."
01:01:04;01:01:06;"- Right. - So you couldn't just,"
01:01:06;01:01:08;"you know, wait for your favorite part."
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Again, it's the same thing. It's almost like"
01:01:10;01:01:12;"""Rage Against the Machine"" in many ways"
01:01:12;01:01:14;"was cursed by being too good."
01:01:14;01:01:17;"They were able to pack so much DNA"
01:01:17;01:01:20;"into their first two songs on their first album,"
01:01:20;01:01:22;"it already probably made them making lots of albums"
01:01:22;01:01:25;"feel, like, irrelevant to them as artists,"
01:01:25;01:01:29;"and also the fact that they're just so good at imagery,"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"that's, like, the weird thing about art."
01:01:31;01:01:33;"If your imagery is, like, too good,"
01:01:33;01:01:36;"it actually can be, like, detrimental to the meaning."
01:01:36;01:01:39;"- Yeah, but because the riffs and the grooves"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"are, like, so undeniable,"
01:01:41;01:01:44;"that's what gave them a mainstream audience."
01:01:44;01:01:47;"And so a certain percentage of that audience"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"is gonna obviously misunderstand"
01:01:49;01:01:52;"or completely be oblivious to the politics,"
01:01:52;01:01:54;"but a certain percentage of this huge audience"
01:01:54;01:01:56;"will, like, get hip to it."
01:01:56;01:01:58;"- No, I-- - And so would you rather have"
01:01:58;01:02:01;"less great music that has a tiny audience"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"that is-- has a higher percentage"
01:02:03;01:02:06;"of adherence to those politics?"
01:02:06;01:02:08;"It's sort of like-- - Yeah, preaching to the choir."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"- I love to think about me being at the Tape World"
01:02:10;01:02:13;"in the mall in, like, suburban Connecticut,"

01:02:19;01:02:20;"who doesn't know anything."
01:02:20;01:02:23;"- No, absolutely, and I'm not criticizing them."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"- No, of course not. - 'Cause I think"
01:02:24;01:02:25;"that's totally true."
01:02:25;01:02:26;"I think ""Rage Against the Machine"""
01:02:26;01:02:29;"got me interested in probably, to some extent,"
01:02:29;01:02:32;"politics or concepts I wasn't familiar with before."
01:02:32;01:02:35;"I remember a friend at school who also liked ""Rage,"""
01:02:35;01:02:37;"and he was definitely from kind of, like--"
01:02:37;01:02:38;"you know, if I had to guess,"
01:02:38;01:02:40;"his dad was probably, like, a lawyer or something."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"I remember they had, like, pretty nice house"
01:02:42;01:02:44;"and white suburban, kind of,"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"truly upper-middle-class family."
01:02:46;01:02:47;"- Yeah. - And I remember"
01:02:47;01:02:48;"he was really into ""Rage,"""
01:02:48;01:02:50;"and I think in ""Evil Empire,"""
01:02:50;01:02:53;"there's, like, a picture in the liner notes"
01:02:53;01:02:57;"or the booklet of, like, just a bunch of books."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Does this ring a bell, Jonah?"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"Can you picture what I'm talking about?"
01:02:59;01:03:00;"- Yeah. Oh, yeah, totally."
01:03:00;01:03:02;"It was a reading list, and you can find it online."
01:03:02;01:03:05;"It's, like, Joan Didion, Malcolm X, Franz Fanon."
01:03:05;01:03:07;"- And I remember-- it was hilarious."
01:03:07;01:03:09;"I should actually catch up with this dude, Ryan,"
01:03:09;01:03:10;"and see if he ever did it."
01:03:10;01:03:11;"He's a cool guy."
01:03:11;01:03:13;"But I just remember us being in, like,"
01:03:13;01:03:14;"fifth grade or something,"
01:03:14;01:03:15;"and just him being, like,"
01:03:15;01:03:16;"us talking about ""Evil Empire"""
01:03:16;01:03:18;"in whatever kind of goofball middle school way,"
01:03:18;01:03:20;"and him being like, ""You know that page in the booklet"
01:03:20;01:03:21;"with all those books?"""
01:03:21;01:03:22;"And I was like, ""Yeah."""
01:03:22;01:03:24;"He's like, ""I'm gonna read all of them."""
01:03:24;01:03:26;"And, like, there's no way"
01:03:26;01:03:29;"that this kid in New Jersey in middle school"
01:03:29;01:03:31;"read, like, ""The Wretched of the Earth"""
01:03:31;01:03:32;"or whatever books were in there."
01:03:32;01:03:35;"But I guess even to say that,"
01:03:35;01:03:38;"that there was a very mainstream band"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"that would make two kids have a conversation"
01:03:40;01:03:42;"about whether or not they did it,"
01:03:42;01:03:46;"but just about maybe we should read all these books."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"That's pretty tight. - Yeah."
01:03:48;01:03:49;"That's amazing."
01:03:49;01:03:50;"- What I was saying about Ridge--"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"I guess when I was talking about how taken I am"
01:03:51;01:03:53;"with their aesthetics and how--"
01:03:53;01:03:54;"it's not just that their music,"
01:03:54;01:03:56;"their riffs were so good."
01:03:56;01:03:58;"There was something about their visual world"
01:03:58;01:04:01;"that was just, like, just killed."
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Their shirts and all that [bleep] looked so good."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"And it's all stuff that, like, sounds--"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"like, it could easily be corny in the wrong hands"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"if you were like, you know, the cover of the first album,"
01:04:09;01:04:12;"we're gonna use, like, an iconic photo from Vietnam,"
01:04:12;01:04:15;"and we're gonna use kind of, like, a typewriter font."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"- Yeah. - Which is, like,"
01:04:16;01:04:17;"sounds bad when you say it,"
01:04:17;01:04:20;"and yet that typewriter rage font"
01:04:20;01:04:21;"still, like, looks amazing."
01:04:21;01:04:23;"And anyway, when I knew Jonah was coming on,"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"I was looking at some of their shirts,"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"and I was, like, trying to remember"
01:04:27;01:04:28;"which rage shirt that I had,"
01:04:28;01:04:30;"and I was picturing other kids I knew at school"
01:04:30;01:04:32;"who liked rage and had rage shirts."
01:04:32;01:04:35;"And I'm just kind of like, not only did they"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"put a lot of, like, lyrical content"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"into the ears of people who otherwise wouldn't have heard it,"
01:04:40;01:04:42;"the [bleep] that they had kids walking around in"
01:04:42;01:04:46;"in middle schools, majority white middle schools"
01:04:46;01:04:47;"around the nation,"
01:04:47;01:04:48;"the radical imagery that they used"
01:04:48;01:04:50;"in some of their shirts, it's pretty incredible."
01:04:50;01:04:52;"The pessimistic side of me is like,"
01:04:52;01:04:56;"and what came of it if now some of those kids"
01:04:56;01:04:59;"or adults tweeting at Tom Morello stick to music?"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"But I'm going to try to be optimistic"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"and dwell on how cool it is"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"that they put that imagery out there."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"So, Jonah, maybe now is a good time"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"for you to talk about your article,"
01:05:09;01:05:12;"and I believe you're wearing this shirt right now, huh?"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"This iconic Rage Against the Machine T-shirt."
01:05:14;01:05:16;"- I know this is an audio medium,"
01:05:16;01:05:18;"so this is-- I'll have to describe it."
01:05:18;01:05:21;"This is actually the Molotov cocktail logo"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"inside a Steely."
01:05:23;01:05:24;"- Oh."
01:05:24;01:05:26;"This is the Grateful Dead meets Rage thing?"
01:05:26;01:05:28;"- Exactly, which I just wore because, you know,"
01:05:28;01:05:31;"I'm coming on TC, and I had to dress special for it."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"- But tell us about the original Rage shirt"
01:05:34;01:05:36;"that you wrote about for your newsletter."
01:05:36;01:05:37;"- If people aren't familiar,"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"kind of one of the real iconic early"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"Rage Against the Machine logos"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"is this kind of black and white cartoon"
01:05:43;01:05:47;"of a hand lighting a Molotov cocktail in a circle,"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"and that, you know, is super common."
01:05:49;01:05:51;"You see that all over the place."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"I had an eBay--"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"like, saved eBay search for a few years"
01:05:54;01:05:56;"for old Rage Against the Machine shirts"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"to see what popped up,"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"and a couple years ago,"
01:05:59;01:06:01;"something came up that I'd never seen before,"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"which is basically the source"
01:06:03;01:06:05;"for the Molotov cocktail illustration."
01:06:05;01:06:07;"So it was, like, a full kind of diagram,"
01:06:07;01:06:08;"and the T-shirt was really faded,"
01:06:08;01:06:10;"so it was kind of hard to make it out,"
01:06:10;01:06:11;"but it's basically three steps"
01:06:11;01:06:15;"for how to, like, douse a rag in kerosene"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"and then stuff it into a bottle"
01:06:17;01:06:19;"and then tape it up and then set it on fire,"
01:06:19;01:06:21;"culminating with throwing it into a police station."
01:06:21;01:06:24;"And that was all on the T-shirt."
01:06:24;01:06:26;"So I was like, ""Holy sh--."
01:06:26;01:06:28;"This is, like, the origin source"
01:06:28;01:06:31;"for this otherwise, like, very easy-to-come-by"
01:06:31;01:06:34;"Molotov cocktail logo, very familiar logo."""
01:06:34;01:06:36;"So I bought it off this dude who--"
01:06:36;01:06:37;"he was the original owner."
01:06:37;01:06:40;"He was in--actually in Minneapolis"
01:06:40;01:06:42;"and bought it at a Rage show"
01:06:42;01:06:45;"at First Avenue, legendary Minneapolis venue."
01:06:45;01:06:47;"So he, like, bought it at the merch table"
01:06:47;01:06:48;"in, like, '92 or something."
01:06:48;01:06:52;"So it shows up, and for a minute,"
01:06:52;01:06:54;"I actually didn't really investigate"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"what the, like, manual for making the Molotov cocktail"
01:06:57;01:06:59;"and throwing it into the police station was about."
01:06:59;01:07:01;"I could see that there was, you know, like,"
01:07:01;01:07:04;"the police station has the word ""Policia"" on it,"
01:07:04;01:07:05;"so you can tell it's Spanish."
01:07:05;01:07:10;"And since Rage were, like, so into the Zapatistas"
01:07:10;01:07:11;"or, like, Shining Path,"
01:07:11;01:07:13;"I assumed that it was some image"
01:07:13;01:07:14;"that they'd plucked from a bit of, like,"
01:07:14;01:07:15;"revolutionary literature"
01:07:15;01:07:18;"and, you know, gotten their logo from it."
01:07:18;01:07:20;"But I think finally the curiosity, like,"
01:07:20;01:07:21;"got to me, and I was like,"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"""Well, I'm trying to figure out what this was."""
01:07:23;01:07:24;"And I think I searched--"
01:07:24;01:07:25;"I don't remember exactly how I got it,"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"but I think maybe I searched some of the, like,"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"instruction text and discovered"
01:07:29;01:07:32;"that it was actually this 15-page"
01:07:32;01:07:34;"illustrated pamphlet that the CIA"
01:07:34;01:07:37;"designed back in the early '80s"
01:07:37;01:07:39;"and had airdropped over Nicaragua"
01:07:39;01:07:41;"as part of their program,"
01:07:41;01:07:42;"like, covert program,"
01:07:42;01:07:45;"to undermine this leftist, democratically elected"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"government of Nicaragua"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"led by Sandinistas in the early '80s."
01:07:49;01:07:51;"And so actually what it is"
01:07:51;01:07:52;"is this pamphlet called"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"""The Freedom Fighters Manual"""
01:07:54;01:07:55;"that the CIA designs,"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"drops over Nicaragua"
01:07:56;01:08:00;"in the hopes of fomenting a popular uprising"
01:08:00;01:08:02;"against the leftist state."
01:08:02;01:08:03;"And so it's super fascinating."
01:08:03;01:08:06;"You get, like, over the course of these 15 pages,"
01:08:06;01:08:07;"you get this insight into, like,"
01:08:07;01:08:10;"what the CIA, at least in 1983,"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"saw as viable strategies"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"for, like, an urban insurrection"
01:08:14;01:08:15;"and a popular uprising."
01:08:15;01:08:16;"- Right."
01:08:16;01:08:17;"- Which they were trying--"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"- And I think it bears emphasizing"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"that in this story,"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"you find this ""Rage Against the Machine"" shirt"
01:08:22;01:08:23;"with a Molotov cocktail,"
01:08:23;01:08:26;"a symbol of, you know, street violence,"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"insurrection against the authorities."
01:08:28;01:08:29;"And then you find that, well,"
01:08:29;01:08:31;"it's from--there's this old ""Rage"" shirt"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"that had this whole little diagram"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"of how to build a Molotov cocktail"
01:08:35;01:08:36;"and throw it at a police station."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"Coincidentally, this person got it in Minneapolis."
01:08:39;01:08:41;"You're like, ""Damn, there's an American band"
01:08:41;01:08:43;"who is selling T-shirts to their fans"
01:08:43;01:08:46;"that basically had instructions for bombing the police."""
01:08:46;01:08:48;"That's really crazy."
01:08:48;01:08:49;"But then the twist--"
01:08:49;01:08:51;"because in America, obviously,"
01:08:51;01:08:53;"the police are the authority figures,"
01:08:53;01:08:56;"and the idea of, like, telling kids, like,"
01:08:56;01:08:57;"that you could bomb a police station,"
01:08:57;01:08:58;"well, that's crazy."
01:08:58;01:09:00;"That's un-American, right?"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"To tell a bunch of kids to bomb a police station?"
01:09:03;01:09:04;"And even--you see that there is a--"
01:09:04;01:09:07;"nobody was hurt, but a police station was set on fire"
01:09:07;01:09:08;"during the protests in Minneapolis."
01:09:08;01:09:11;"And for right-wingers, that became a symbol"
01:09:11;01:09:15;"of anti-American horrible violence, right?"
01:09:15;01:09:20;"What kind of animals would set a police station on fire, right?"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"And then, Jonah, in your research,"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"you find out that this image"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"comes from an American manual"
01:09:26;01:09:30;"to encourage Nicaraguans to do that in their country."
01:09:30;01:09:33;"I know, like, obviously, studying American history,"
01:09:33;01:09:37;"we find these ironies and hypocrisies"
01:09:37;01:09:38;"over and over again,"
01:09:38;01:09:41;"but it is worth dwelling on for a second"
01:09:41;01:09:42;"that the American government,"
01:09:42;01:09:45;"in the form of the CIA, in other countries,"
01:09:45;01:09:49;"encouraged people to set police stations on fire."
01:09:49;01:09:52;"Not that anyone was saying blue lives matter in 1983,"
01:09:52;01:09:55;"but, like, clearly, like, blue lives do not matter"
01:09:55;01:09:58;"to, you know, American interests"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"when they work for a government"
01:10:00;01:10:03;"that's at odds with Western business interests."

01:10:50;01:10:53;"a kind of, like, relative to what else the CIA"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"was doing at the same time in Nicaragua,"
01:10:55;01:10:57;"like, funding the Contras, who were doing, like,"
01:10:57;01:10:59;"wild massacres of women and children."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"This is actually kind of, like, light and almost cute."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Like, you look earlier in the manual,"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"it kind of ramps up to the Molotov cocktail."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"And by the way, like, if listeners Google"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Freedom Fighters manual, you can find the full PDF."
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Like, early on, it's kind of, like,"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"little acts of disobedience, like, go to the factory"
01:11:14;01:11:17;"that you work at and put a little coin"
01:11:17;01:11:19;"in between the light bulb and the socket"
01:11:19;01:11:21;"so, like, the light won't turn on."
01:11:21;01:11:23;"Call in sick to work, and it kind of, like, ramps up."
01:11:23;01:11:25;"- Yeah, I'm looking at it now."
01:11:25;01:11:30;"One of them is go to the Sandinista Cooperative Farm"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"where they're trying to, like, I guess, provide, you know,"
01:11:32;01:11:35;"like, any good socialist state,"
01:11:35;01:11:37;"full resources to feed the people."
01:11:37;01:11:40;"So one of the images is go to the Sandinista Farm"
01:11:40;01:11:43;"and leave the gate open, let the cows out."
01:11:43;01:11:45;"Just, like, so harsh."
01:11:45;01:11:48;"Just, like, any way you could just, like, [bleep] up."
01:11:48;01:11:50;"The fact that they're encouraging people to do everything"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"from let the cows out at the farm to bomb the police."
01:11:52;01:11:54;"- They have let the cows out, and then there's actually,"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"like, a real kind vibe one,"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"which might be on the same page, which is"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"instead of planting crops, plant flowers."
01:12:00;01:12:02;"- [laughs]"
01:12:02;01:12:06;"You get to simultaneously feed less people,"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"lower the crop yield, and, you know,"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"provide something kind of pretty."
01:12:10;01:12:12;"- Exactly. - Another one of them is"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"make false hotel reservations."
01:12:14;01:12:16;"What was that supposed to accomplish? Just, like--"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"- Yeah, I guess it's, like, just, like, stirring, like,"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"very, like, low-key chaos."
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Or not even--chaos is too harsh of a word, right?"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"Just low-key confusion and just kind of"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"gumming up the works in small ways."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"But then it gets more and more violent as it goes on,"
01:12:28;01:12:32;"and it's like, leave nails in the road for, you know,"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"to, like, shred tires of passing cars."
01:12:34;01:12:36;"And it ramps up."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"I've been trying to get Tom Morello to explain,"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"because he did an interview around the time"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"that I could find where people--"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"someone asked him about this T-shirt"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"that I found with the full manual"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"for the Molotov cocktail being thrown"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"into the police station, and he put it in the context of,"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"""I think it's kind of cool that, like,"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"""even if you can't check out the 'Anarchist Cookbook'"
01:12:54;01:12:57;"""from a library, you could look at your buddy's T-shirt"
01:12:57;01:13:00;"""and find, you know, a manual for an urban insurrection."""
01:13:00;01:13:02;"He didn't actually, like, acknowledge"
01:13:02;01:13:05;"that it came from this interestingly anti-communist--"
01:13:05;01:13:07;"- From the CIA. - From the CIA."
01:13:07;01:13:09;"- Right. - And so I don't know if he doesn't know that."
01:13:09;01:13:11;"- He was talking about as if it was, like,"
01:13:11;01:13:13;"an actual freedom fighter, not a--"
01:13:13;01:13:15;"- Right. - Well, I guess one man's"
01:13:15;01:13:17;"freedom fighter is another man's CIA-backed"
01:13:17;01:13:19;"agent of capitalism."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"But I also just gotta say that"
01:13:21;01:13:24;"it was happening well before the '80s in Nicaragua,"
01:13:24;01:13:28;"but the concept-- I assume the U.S. invented it,"
01:13:28;01:13:31;"but of just, like, dropping pamphlets from a plane,"
01:13:31;01:13:33;"just, like, blanketing a country,"
01:13:33;01:13:36;"it's, like, so insane that that was, like,"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"a regular phenomenon."
01:13:38;01:13:40;"Like, I wonder how often that actually"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"changed somebody's mind."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"It seems like some sh-- somebody's trying to promote"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"a concert or something, like, just like,"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"""Hey, I don't know. Why don't we just print up,"
01:13:48;01:13:51;"""like, you know, 20,000 flyers and just drop 'em?"""
01:13:51;01:13:53;"- I wonder if that seems so analog to the idea"
01:13:53;01:13:55;"that it seems so analog and quaint"
01:13:55;01:13:57;"because now we're accustomed to"
01:13:57;01:14:00;"information traveling online the way it does,"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"but, like, before the Internet,"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"I guess if some sh-- fell out of the sky,"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"you'd pick it up and take it seriously?"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"I don't know. - I wonder, yeah."
01:14:08;01:14:10;"- I assume it's real in that HBO show,"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"the ""Watchmen"" show,"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"they reference flyers raining down"
01:14:15;01:14:18;"on Black American soldiers fighting in World War II,"
01:14:18;01:14:21;"which might have been printed up by the Nazis,"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"but that are basically said,"
01:14:23;01:14:25;"""What are you fighting for?"
01:14:25;01:14:27;"""Your country treats you like sh--."""
01:14:27;01:14:29;"'Cause I think a lot of times, like,"
01:14:29;01:14:31;"pamphlets that were dropped on countries"
01:14:31;01:14:33;"were kind of trying to, yeah, just change people's minds."
01:14:33;01:14:35;"It's like, ""Give it up, man."""
01:14:35;01:14:37;"- Ezra, that is accurate. It's based on a true story."
01:14:37;01:14:40;"- Do you have the actual language of the Nazi pamphlets?"
01:14:40;01:14:42;"- Yes. I'll email it to you."
01:14:42;01:14:44;"It's a lot."
01:14:44;01:14:46;"- So I've been sending tweets to Tom,"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"but he hasn't responded to my tweets."
01:14:48;01:14:50;"- All right, we gotta get Tom Morello on the horn."
01:14:50;01:14:52;"- So this is the actual pamphlet"
01:14:52;01:14:54;"that the Germans dropped down."
01:14:54;01:14:56;"I can't believe this is real,"
01:14:56;01:14:58;"but this is from World War I, actually,"
01:14:58;01:15:00;"so it wasn't the Nazis."
01:15:00;01:15:02;"It says, ""To the colored soldiers of the U.S. Army,"
01:15:02;01:15:05;"""Hallo, boys. What are you doing over here?"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"""Fighting the Germans? Why?"
01:15:07;01:15:09;"""Have they ever done you any harm?"""
01:15:09;01:15:11;"- Why? - Of course the white--"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"[laughter]"
01:15:13;01:15:15;"- Why are you fighting us? - I can't believe this is real."
01:15:15;01:15:17;"""Of course some white folks"
01:15:17;01:15:19;"""in the lying English-American papers"
01:15:19;01:15:21;"""were telling the Germans all to be wiped out"
01:15:21;01:15:23;"""for the sake of humanity and democracy."
01:15:23;01:15:25;"""What is democracy? Personal freedom."
01:15:25;01:15:27;"""All citizens enjoying the same rights"

01:15:29;01:15:31;"""Do you enjoy the same rights as the white people do in America,"
01:15:31;01:15:33;"""the land of freedom and democracy?"""
01:15:33;01:15:35;"They were making some decent points."
01:15:35;01:15:37;"I guess when I was picturing it being World War II,"
01:15:37;01:15:39;"'cause I had my timeline wrong,"
01:15:39;01:15:42;"the idea of the Nazis dropping that seems so crass."
01:15:42;01:15:45;"I'm not as familiar with the racial politics"
01:15:45;01:15:48;"of 1914 Germany."
01:15:48;01:15:50;"- Yeah, but it's like... - Anyway."
01:15:50;01:15:52;"- They're already over there. - Yeah."
01:15:52;01:15:54;"They can't just go home."
01:15:54;01:15:56;"If you're a soldier in a trench in World War I"
01:15:56;01:15:58;"and you get a pamphlet that's like,"
01:15:58;01:16:00;"""What are you fighting for?"""
01:16:00;01:16:02;"You'd probably be like,"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"""Man, it's out of my hands. I'm stuck here."""
01:16:04;01:16:06;"- Well, okay. There's a few paragraphs"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"that, you know, make some decent points,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"like, ""Do you have the same rights back home?"""
01:16:10;01:16:12;"- Right. - They're correct about that."
01:16:12;01:16:14;"And then they say, ""In Germany, you'd be treated"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"""as a gentleman, not as a second-class citizen."""
01:16:16;01:16:18;"Ironically, the Nazis rose to power"
01:16:18;01:16:20;"about 20 years after this."
01:16:20;01:16:22;"- Dubious claim. - Yeah, dubious claim."
01:16:22;01:16:24;"But, you know, what they're saying about America"
01:16:24;01:16:26;"was correct. But in the end, the last two lines"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"are, ""Throw it away and come over to the German lines."
01:16:28;01:16:30;"""You will find friends who'll help you along."""
01:16:30;01:16:32;"I wonder if there's any stories that somebody read that"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"and was like, ""All right. Hey, I don't know."""
01:16:34;01:16:36;"You sneak over in the middle of the night,"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"show them the flyer, and say, like,"
01:16:38;01:16:40;"""Yeah, you made some decent points."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"""What's up?"" ""I don't know."""
01:16:42;01:16:44;"But clearly, this was..."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"As long as there have been planes,"
01:16:46;01:16:48;"there have been people dropping pamphlets"
01:16:48;01:16:50;"out of planes. So, Jonah, I asked you,"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"just because I knew we were gonna be talking about"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"Rage merch, and it made me reflect on Rage merch,"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I remember one specific shirt that I had."
01:16:56;01:16:58;"It said, ""Rage Against the Machine."
01:16:58;01:17:00;"""We support our troops."""
01:17:00;01:17:02;"And now that actually I'm thinking about it,"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"I get, like, vague memories of, like,"
01:17:04;01:17:06;"a teacher being like, ""We support our troops."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"""Nice. Rage Against the Machine."
01:17:08;01:17:10;"""What the hell does that mean?"""
01:17:10;01:17:12;"And me being like, ""It's a band."""
01:17:12;01:17:14;"And I picked up this shirt that I used to have,"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"my beloved Rage shirt, and there's a picture"
01:17:16;01:17:18;"of four people holding weapons."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"They look like some type of guerrilla fighters."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"I bet as a kid I assumed it was the band,"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"just 'cause it was four people."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"Jonah, do you know this shirt? Do you have any info"
01:17:26;01:17:28;"on what's actually happening in that picture?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Yeah, totally. So that's one of the promo images"
01:17:30;01:17:32;"from Evil Empire, so it makes sense that that's"
01:17:32;01:17:34;"when you hopped on board Rage Against the Machine"
01:17:34;01:17:36;"fandom and copped that T-shirt, because,"
01:17:36;01:17:38;"yeah, it's, like, 1996, they're rolling out that album."
01:17:38;01:17:40;"I think it originated as a poster,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"a photo of four"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"Zapatista rebel fighters"
01:17:44;01:17:46;"in Chiapas, Mexico. So the Zapatistas"
01:17:46;01:17:48;"were this far-left group."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Actually, I shouldn't say past tense. They still exist."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Are this far-left group."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"Indigenous Mexicans, I think mostly Mayans,"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"who, really interestingly,"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"were formed to"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"protest and fight the enactment of"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"NAFTA, which was gonna"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"have any number of adverse"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"effects on indigenous Mexican"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"peoples' agricultural"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"livelihoods. So that's four"
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Zapatistas. But yeah, like, Zach"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"got super into the Zapatistas. He's of"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Mexican descent. That's probably where"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"that originates, in terms of his interest in them."
01:18:18;01:18:20;"But yeah, it's four rebels in Chiapas."
01:18:20;01:18:22;"And actually, I've got to recommend,"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"anybody who's interested in"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"Mexican politics, there's"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"a great Netflix"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"doc series called 1994,"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"which is a very tumultuous"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"time in Mexican politics,"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"and a lot of it talks about the"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"Zapatista uprising, but also"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"political leaders were"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"being assassinated, and essentially"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"one political party had been ruling Mexico"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"for decades at that point, and"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"things were kind of falling apart. So,"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"it's pretty intense, this 1994"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"Netflix doc. And, 'cause when I think about"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"being a kid in the '90s,"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"you'd hear about the Zapatistas"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"here and there, but it's like,"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"I think I was much older when"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"I fully understood that situation."
01:19:02;01:19:04;"So yeah, even that's wild."
01:19:04;01:19:06;"Just like, kids rocking"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"Zapatista shirts,"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"listening to Rage Against the Machine in the mid-90s,"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"they really were"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"working hard to familiarize"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"people with different ways of thinking"
01:19:16;01:19:18;"and different situations."
01:19:18;01:19:20;"I sent you another shirt that I remember"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"a girl, Liz Zink, at my school"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"had. It looks very communist."
01:19:24;01:19:26;"I don't know what it was, but it's like,"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"it looks kind of like a communist poster of a woman."
01:19:28;01:19:30;"Do you have any backstory on that one?"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So,"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"the front of it is"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"an image of a very"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"proud-looking woman"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"with a headscarf on, and she's holding"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"a flag, and she's standing in front of a factory."
01:19:42;01:19:44;"And the back of it"
01:19:44;01:19:46;"says, ""Women constitute"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"half of the world's population, perform"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"nearly two-thirds of its work hours,"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"receive one-tenth of the world's income,"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"and own less than one-one-hundredth"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"of the world's property."""
01:19:56;01:19:58;"And that's a quote attributed to a UN report."
01:19:58;01:20:00;"So, the theme of it"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"is, I guess"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"you could say, you know, women's rights,"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"women's liberation. But what's fascinating is,"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"yeah, the image on the front is a piece"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"of Russian, like"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"Soviet-era propaganda. It's sort of"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"like constructivist vibes. It's not"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"as flat and 2D as, like,"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"a Rodchenko, but"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"it is a 1926 painted"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"poster. The original"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"translates to, ""Liberated woman,"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"build up socialism."" So, it was like a Soviet"
01:20:26;01:20:28;"call to women"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"to kind of, you know, feel included"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"in the project. That's amazing"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"because I can... I don't remember what it"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"said on the back, but I can really vividly picture"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"this girl I was friends with in middle school,"
01:20:38;01:20:40;"Liz Zink. And she had"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"this dark green version"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"of that shirt, and it was just really striking"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"to me. Maybe it's always like this,"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"but that era of being a kid in middle"
01:20:48;01:20:50;"school in the 90s, as little"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"as I remember about that time, there's so many details"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"I can't remember about that era"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"of life, I can very vividly"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"remember band shirts,"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"which ones I had, and which ones other kids"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"had. I don't know if it's because I was just getting"
01:21:02;01:21:04;"interested in t-shirts at that moment, and interested"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"in music, so it, like, really"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"struck me. More than any other element"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"of middle school fashion,"
01:21:10;01:21:12;"I can remember kids' shoes, and I can remember which"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"band shirts kids had."
01:21:14;01:21:16;"I also remember, like, there being an older kid"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"in middle school who had the one"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"where it's all, like, the nuns holding guns."
01:21:20;01:21:22;"Like, Rage Against the Machine shirts really"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"stood out. I mean, obviously, the fact"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"that we're talking about it now, it's like, I unknowingly"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"just wearing the Zappatista shirt,"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"somebody wearing a communist"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"Rage shirt, they really"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"were doing something different."
01:21:34;01:21:36;"I think it's cool. I'm glad that you brought up that, um,"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"the woman in front of the factory"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"t-shirt as well, because I think that's part of what makes"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Rage Against the Machine. Like, they've"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"aged so well in so many ways,"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"and one of the things was, like,"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"in concerts in the 90s,"
01:21:48;01:21:50;"like, Zach Taylor Richard would, like, pause the concert"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"and talk about, like, how"
01:21:52;01:21:54;"it sucked that women -- like, if he's playing a"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"college show, like, it sucks that women are walking this campus"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"in fear at night, and you should"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"all feel safe here in this concert."
01:22:00;01:22:02;"Evil Empire has a song, ""The Wind Below,"" right?"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"And there's a line about a woman"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"with a weapon and a shawl."
01:22:06;01:22:08;"The figure of the woman in Rage Against the Machine"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"songs never shows up in, like, a love ballad"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"like Jake was saying, but, like, shows"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"up as a revolutionary or as a worker"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"or as a migrant. Like, women kind of"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"figure not constantly in"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"their lyrics, but do pop up, but always"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"in this kind of interesting, kind of grounded"
01:22:22;01:22:24;"in kind of global history, global"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"struggle kind of context. But they"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"were -- if you think about"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"like how nu metal and rap rock was"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"so dude-ish and how a lot of that"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"was so obnoxious precisely"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"because of how dude-ish it was,"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"it's, like, really important to mark that Rage Against the Machine"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"were, like, super feminist back --"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"you know, all the way at the start. -Everything that"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"Paul Ryan wouldn't like."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Well, thanks so much, Jonah."
01:22:46;01:22:48;"I love going deep on merch."
01:22:48;01:22:50;"We gotta have you back to, like,"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"get into some more, like, iconic"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"rock merch. -It's funny, I've only"
01:22:54;01:22:56;"gone deep on Rage Against the Machine because, like"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"you, I just cared so much about these t-shirts"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"when I was a kid. But, yeah, maybe I can"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"carve out a sideline as the merch correspondent"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"for TC. -Yeah, let us"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"know if you come across anything interesting."
01:23:06;01:23:08;"Thanks to Jonah Weiner and everybody"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"check out Blackbird Spy Plane,"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"Jonah's newsletter, and also"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"I'd be remiss to not"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"point out here on Time Crisis that"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"back in the day,"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"you wrote a great profile for the New York"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"Times of Jerry Seinfeld."
01:23:22;01:23:24;"-Check it out. Hung out with him a bunch."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"-Wow. -What year did that come out?"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"-I got a horrible sense of time, but he was editing"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"the first season of"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"Comedians in Cars, so whenever that was."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"-Did he talk about putting Seinfeld back on the television?"
01:23:34;01:23:36;"-He was putting Cars"
01:23:36;01:23:38;"and Coffee on computer screens"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"at that point, so he was all"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"preoccupied with that. -If you ever get another"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"chance to profile him, you should do"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"a bait and switch and send Seinfeld."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"And he's just there to talk"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"about the new season of Comedians in Cars,"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"Jim Cross, he's just like, ""Okay, what about"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"Seinfeld?"" -Oh, by the way, Ezra,"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"it's funny to hear you talk about"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"Rage Against the Machine influencing"
01:23:58;01:24:00;"California English."
01:24:00;01:24:02;"The other thing that I did recently, in addition to interviewing"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"you for Blackbird Spy Plane about a t-shirt"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"that you love, I did an interview with"
01:24:06;01:24:08;"Andre 3000 last week, and"
01:24:08;01:24:10;"part of the reason that he wanted to talk"
01:24:10;01:24:12;"to Blackbird Spy Plane was because of this"
01:24:12;01:24:14;"Rage Against the Machine post, and I didn't realize it"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"at the time, but at the end of the call, he"
01:24:16;01:24:18;"mentioned, ""Hey, I really like that Rage Against the Machine post,"""
01:24:18;01:24:20;"and I since discovered that"
01:24:20;01:24:22;"Bombs Over Baghdad was inspired by"
01:24:22;01:24:24;"listening to Rage Against the Machine. That's why"
01:24:24;01:24:26;"he wrote that song, because he just"
01:24:26;01:24:28;"wanted to capture the energy of"
01:24:28;01:24:30;"Rage Against the Machine and kind of like, transmit"
01:24:30;01:24:32;"some of that vibe into an OutKast song."
01:24:32;01:24:34;"-Whoa. -Cool."
01:24:34;01:24:36;"-Wow, that's really interesting. Yeah, especially 'cause"
01:24:36;01:24:38;"for me, just as a fan growing up,"
01:24:38;01:24:40;"I think of Bombs Over Baghdad"
01:24:40;01:24:42;"as being one of those,"
01:24:42;01:24:44;"obviously a little bit later than when I was a big"
01:24:44;01:24:46;"Rage fan, but being one of those songs that I just"
01:24:46;01:24:48;"happen to see the video or hear it on the radio,"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"and just really being like, ""What is"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"this?"" I mean, I knew who OutKast was,"
01:24:52;01:24:54;"I remember Rosa Parks was already a big hit"
01:24:54;01:24:56;"before then, but they had a lot of big hits"
01:24:56;01:24:58;"actually before then, but there's something about hearing"
01:24:58;01:25:00;"Bombs Over Baghdad that actually is"
01:25:00;01:25:02;"a real fundamental moment, where I was just like,"
01:25:02;01:25:04;"""Whoa, this is the coolest"
01:25:04;01:25:06;"thing I've heard up until this point."""
01:25:06;01:25:08;"-Totally. -Wow. Fascinating"
01:25:08;01:25:10;"connection. Alright, well thanks Jonah, we'll have to have you"
01:25:10;01:25:12;"back. -Take it easy guys."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"-Alright, peace. -See ya. -Bye dude."

01:40:47;01:40:48;"This is 6ix9ine?"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"Yeah. He was doing his kind of whisper voice the first half,"
01:40:51;01:40:53;"but this is the voice he's best known for."
01:40:53;01:40:56;"He's a very controversial figure,"
01:40:56;01:41:00;"but I do have to say, when I hear him go into his crazy yelling voice,"
01:41:00;01:41:04;"I get it. I get why it's like, you know, he's got a good yelling voice."
01:41:04;01:41:06;"It's like real New York yelling music."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"Yeah."

01:41:15;01:41:19;"Zac DeLaRocca and Tekashi 6ix9ine"
01:41:19;01:41:23;"might be the two most successful Mexican-American rappers of all time."
01:41:23;01:41:26;"They're far from the only ones, and there's certainly"
01:41:26;01:41:29;"other Mexican-American rappers who are maybe more iconic"
01:41:29;01:41:32;"and speak more about their heritage,"
01:41:32;01:41:34;"especially in Southern California."
01:41:34;01:41:37;"But just in terms of sales, those are the big two."
01:41:37;01:41:38;"Wow."
01:41:38;01:41:41;"We don't have to crunch those numbers today, but I think it might be true."
01:41:41;01:41:43;"The number three song, 1992."
01:41:43;01:41:45;"Wow. ""Criss Cross Jump."""
01:41:45;01:41:47;"This is a killer top five."
01:41:47;01:41:48;"Yeah."
01:41:48;01:41:51;"For anybody who doesn't remember, Criss Cross was a duo,"
01:41:51;01:41:54;"two young kids, and they wore all their clothes backwards."
01:41:54;01:41:56;"That was their gimmick."
01:41:56;01:42:02;"And their names were Mac Daddy and Daddy Mac."
01:42:02;01:42:05;"This is the first recorded media I ever bought."
01:42:05;01:42:07;"This was a cassette that I bought when I was a kid."
01:42:07;01:42:08;"You bought the cassette single?"
01:42:08;01:42:10;"The single, the maxi single of the song."
01:42:10;01:42:11;"Wow."
01:42:11;01:42:15;"I went out to the whiz, walked from my house to the whiz"

01:42:17;01:42:18;"Oh my God."
01:42:18;01:42:19;"To buy this?"
01:42:19;01:42:21;"To buy this."
01:42:21;01:42:24;"I wonder if back then, there'd be some kids"
01:42:24;01:42:27;"walking toward some backwards sh*t on, and you're just like,"

01:42:34;01:42:35;"One of the kids died?"
01:42:35;01:42:40;"Chris died in 2013 at age 34."
01:42:40;01:42:42;"Damn, so young."
01:42:42;01:42:44;"Yeah."
01:42:45;01:42:47;"Jump, jump."
01:42:51;01:42:53;"It says this was used in a television commercial"
01:42:53;01:42:55;"for Philadelphia cream cheese."
01:42:55;01:42:57;"I don't remember that one."
01:42:57;01:43:01;"Why would ""Jump"" be a song for cream cheese?"
01:43:01;01:43:04;"That's..."
01:43:04;01:43:07;"There's nothing about cream cheese that screams ""Jump."""
01:43:07;01:43:09;"You don't want to jump while you're eating cream cheese."
01:43:09;01:43:12;"You don't want to jump any time after cream cheese."
01:43:12;01:43:15;"I'm picturing the professionally photographed,"
01:43:15;01:43:19;"mildly slow motion knife applying cream cheese"

01:43:21;01:43:23;"Jump, jump."
01:43:23;01:43:25;"Spreading it into a bagel, and then some dude"
01:43:25;01:43:28;"pouring a cup of coffee in his suburban kitchen."
01:43:28;01:43:30;"I can picture some people wearing cross colors,"
01:43:30;01:43:33;"90s hip hop stuff, bouncing on trampolines,"
01:43:33;01:43:36;"holding two bagels with cream cheese and flipping."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"Woo!"
01:43:38;01:43:39;"Jump, jump."
01:43:39;01:43:41;"Like a Nickelodeon commercial."
01:43:41;01:43:43;"But I just wanted to say,"
01:43:43;01:43:45;"I'm looking at all the samples in ""Jump,"""
01:43:45;01:43:46;"and there's a lot."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"""Funky Worm"" by the Ohio Players,"
01:43:48;01:43:50;"which I think is the synth."
01:43:50;01:43:51;"Yeah."
01:43:51;01:43:52;"But one of the main samples is"
01:43:52;01:43:54;"""I Want You Back"" by the Jackson 5."
01:43:54;01:43:55;"It's really interesting because"
01:43:55;01:43:56;"I think that's where the"
01:43:56;01:43:57;"[sings]"
01:43:57;01:43:58;"comes from."
01:43:58;01:44:01;"But it's so much more dark,"
01:44:01;01:44:04;"and it's minor key and menacing."
01:44:04;01:44:06;"We all know in Jackson 5, ""I Want You Back"" is"
01:44:06;01:44:10;"[sings]"
01:44:10;01:44:11;"""I Want You Back."""
01:44:11;01:44:13;"It's a happy song, but in here it's so dark."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"[sings]"
01:44:15;01:44:16;"Play it again."
01:44:16;01:44:17;"Jump, jump."
01:44:17;01:44:18;"You know you should know better."
01:44:18;01:44:22;"[sings]"
01:44:22;01:44:24;"Yeah, they just repeat the first three notes."
01:44:24;01:44:25;"They don't resolve it."
01:44:25;01:44:26;"Smart sample."
01:44:26;01:44:28;"There's another sample from a song called"
01:44:28;01:44:31;"""Impeach the President"" by the Honey Drippers."
01:44:31;01:44:33;"That's probably the drums."
01:44:33;01:44:35;"I only know it because it's just like"
01:44:35;01:44:37;"a famous drum loop."
01:44:37;01:44:39;"So anytime you download a bunch of breakbeats,"
01:44:39;01:44:41;"there's always ""Impeach the President."""
01:44:41;01:44:43;"Is that from the '70s, like Nixon era?"
01:44:43;01:44:45;"That's a great question."
01:44:45;01:44:46;"Probably."
01:44:46;01:44:49;"You can totally imagine that people talking about"
01:44:49;01:44:50;"how Nixon's getting impeached,"
01:44:50;01:44:53;"and then somebody drops a funk song."
01:44:53;01:44:55;"""Impeach the President"" released"
01:44:55;01:44:57;"by the Honey Drippers in 1973."
01:44:57;01:44:58;"Yeah, so..."
01:44:58;01:45:00;"It's a protest song advocating the impeachment"
01:45:00;01:45:02;"of then-President of the United States,"
01:45:02;01:45:03;"Richard Nixon."
01:45:03;01:45:07;"And it's been sampled in a billion rap songs."
01:45:07;01:45:10;"Yeah, it's one of those breakbeats that's just like"
01:45:10;01:45:12;"probably hundreds and hundreds of samples."

01:47:33;01:47:35;"- Yeah, the one that I remember just because it's funny"
01:47:35;01:47:38;"because it's so not a rock song was Married in a Gold Rush"

01:47:48;01:47:51;"So he now has a career total of 40."

01:50:00;01:50:03;"how explicitly it's not just any curvy women,"
01:50:03;01:50:04;"it's curvy black women."
01:50:04;01:50:06;"Those two girls at the beginning,"

01:58:43;01:58:45;"for some reason it reminds me"
01:58:45;01:58:47;"of, like, a Jerry Garcia,"
01:58:47;01:58:49;"like, acoustic live thing."
01:58:49;01:58:51;"I feel like Jerry singing that"
01:58:51;01:58:52;"would actually rule."
01:58:52;01:58:53;"His voice would just cut through"
01:58:53;01:58:54;"in a different way."
01:58:54;01:58:55;"- Right."
01:58:55;01:58:57;"- Jerry Garcia band used to do"
01:58:57;01:58:58;"""Lay Down Sally"" a lot."
01:58:58;01:58:59;"- Sure."
01:58:59;01:59:00;"- He maybe is a better interpreter"
01:59:00;01:59:02;"of Clapton's work than--"
01:59:02;01:59:03;"- I mean, yeah,"
01:59:03;01:59:04;"and then when the Dead did"
01:59:04;01:59:07;"the ""Reckoning"" acoustic album,"
01:59:07;01:59:09;"I mean, there's just more rigor"
01:59:09;01:59:10;"in their album."
01:59:10;01:59:11;"Like, this is, like, very--"
01:59:11;01:59:13;"this Clapton is just very, like,"
01:59:13;01:59:15;"schmaltzy and, like, slack."
01:59:15;01:59:16;"It doesn't--"
01:59:16;01:59:18;"there's no, like, tension in it."
01:59:18;01:59:20;"- The soloing's not interesting."
01:59:20;01:59:22;"Yeah, it's--sorry."
01:59:22;01:59:23;"- Hey, Jake, have you heard"
01:59:23;01:59:25;"""Jay-Z Unplugged""?"
01:59:25;01:59:26;"- No."
01:59:26;01:59:27;"- Oh, that's a great one."
01:59:27;01:59:28;"- With the roots?"
01:59:28;01:59:29;"- Yeah, that was cool."
01:59:29;01:59:30;"- Yeah, with the roots."
01:59:30;01:59:31;"- That's tight."
01:59:31;01:59:34;"- The number one song right now"
01:59:34;01:59:35;"is another Lil Baby song."
01:59:35;01:59:36;"That's wild."
01:59:36;01:59:37;"On Apple Music right now,"
01:59:37;01:59:39;"Lil Baby number one,"
01:59:39;01:59:40;"DaBaby number two,"
01:59:40;01:59:41;"Lil Baby number three."
01:59:41;01:59:42;"And this song's called"
01:59:42;01:59:43;"""The Bigger Picture,"""
01:59:43;01:59:46;"and this is a political song."
01:59:46;01:59:47;"It features commentary"
01:59:47;01:59:48;"on police brutality"
01:59:48;01:59:49;"and systemic racism"
01:59:49;01:59:50;"in America in the wake"
01:59:50;01:59:52;"of the murder of George Floyd."
01:59:52;01:59:54;"So I guess he made it"
01:59:54;01:59:57;"very quickly after protesting."
01:59:57;01:59:58;"Proceeds from this song"
01:59:58;01:59:59;"go to the National Association"
01:59:59;02:00:00;"of Black Journalists,"
02:00:00;02:00:02;"Breonna Taylor's attorney,"
02:00:02;02:00:03;"the Bail Project,"
02:00:03;02:00:04;"and Black Lives Matter."
02:00:04;02:00:06;"- Last night, people protesting"
02:00:06;02:00:07;"in Minneapolis escalated"
02:00:07;02:00:09;"as demonstrators were lashed"
02:00:09;02:00:12;"by tear gas and rubber bullets."
02:00:12;02:00:13;"- The main message here--"
02:00:14;02:00:15;"- The main message here"
02:00:15;02:00:16;"is that they want to see"
02:00:16;02:00:17;"those officers involved."
02:00:17;02:00:18;"- They want to see"
02:00:18;02:00:19;"those officers arrested."
02:00:19;02:00:21;"- Officers arrested."
02:00:21;02:00:22;"- Out here, free!"
02:00:22;02:00:23;"Out here, free!"
02:00:23;02:00:25;"- Trade my 4x4 for a GC3,"
02:00:25;02:00:27;"ain't no more free, let's be."
02:00:27;02:00:28;"I gave 'em chance and chance"
02:00:28;02:00:29;"and chance again."
02:00:29;02:00:30;"I even told 'em, ""Please."""
02:00:30;02:00:31;"I find it crazy to police"
02:00:31;02:00:32;"and shoot you and know"
02:00:32;02:00:33;"that you dead,"
02:00:33;02:00:34;"but still tell you to freeze."
02:00:34;02:00:35;"Nobody seen what I seen."
02:00:35;02:00:36;"I guess that mean hold 'em down"
02:00:36;02:00:37;"if you say you can't breathe."
02:00:37;02:00:38;"It's too many mothers"
02:00:38;02:00:39;"just grieving."
02:00:39;02:00:40;"They killing us for no reason."
02:00:40;02:00:41;"Been going on for too long"
02:00:41;02:00:42;"to get even."
02:00:42;02:00:43;"Throw us in cages"
02:00:43;02:00:44;"like dogs and hyenas."
02:00:44;02:00:45;"I went to court"
02:00:45;02:00:46;"and they sent me to prison."
02:00:46;02:00:47;"My mama was cursed"
02:00:47;02:00:48;"to have me leave."
02:00:48;02:00:49;"First I was drunk"
02:00:49;02:00:50;"then I sobered up quick"
02:00:50;02:00:51;"when I heard all that time"
02:00:51;02:00:52;"that they gave to Tali."
02:00:52;02:00:53;"He got a license plus."
02:00:53;02:00:54;"We just some products"
02:00:54;02:00:55;"of our environment."
02:00:55;02:00:56;"How the fuck"
02:00:56;02:00:57;"they gon' blame us?"
02:00:57;02:00:58;"You can't fight fire with fire,"
02:00:58;02:00:59;"I know, but at least"
02:00:59;02:01:00;"we can turn off the flames, son."
02:01:00;02:01:01;"Every colored person ain't done"
02:01:01;02:01:02;"and all whites not racist."
02:01:02;02:01:03;"I be judging by the mind and heart."
02:01:03;02:01:04;"I ain't really in the face."
02:01:04;02:01:05;"Look, the way that we living"
02:01:05;02:01:06;"is not getting better."
02:01:06;02:01:07;"You gotta know how to survive."
02:01:07;02:01:08;"Crazy, I had to tell"
02:01:08;02:01:09;"all of my lovers"
02:01:09;02:01:10;"to carry a gun"
02:01:10;02:01:11;"when they going outside."
02:01:11;02:01:12;"Stay in the mirror"
02:01:12;02:01:13;"whenever you drive."
02:01:13;02:01:14;"Overprotective,"
02:01:14;02:01:15;"go crazy for mine."
02:01:15;02:01:17;"You gotta pay attention to the sign."
02:01:17;02:01:18;"Seem like the blind"
02:01:18;02:01:19;"following the blind."
02:01:19;02:01:20;"Thinking 'bout everything"
02:01:20;02:01:21;"that's going on."
02:01:21;02:01:22;"I put security up in my home."
02:01:22;02:01:23;"I'm with my kind"
02:01:23;02:01:24;"if they right or they wrong."
02:01:24;02:01:25;"I call 'em down here"
02:01:25;02:01:26;"to pick up the phone"
02:01:26;02:01:27;"and it's five in the morning."
02:01:27;02:01:28;"He waking up on it."
02:01:28;02:01:29;"Tell 'em wherever I'm at"
02:01:29;02:01:30;"then they coming."
02:01:30;02:01:31;"I see blue lights,"
02:01:31;02:01:32;"I get scared to start running."
02:01:32;02:01:33;"That shit be crazy,"
02:01:33;02:01:34;"they post to protect us."
02:01:34;02:01:35;"Guards in handcuffs"
02:01:35;02:01:36;"and arrest us."
02:01:36;02:01:37;"Why they go home at night?"
02:01:37;02:01:38;"That shit mashed up."
02:01:38;02:01:39;"Knowing we needed help,"
02:01:39;02:01:40;"they neglect us."
02:01:40;02:01:41;"One of them"
02:01:41;02:01:42;"who gon' make them respect us."
02:01:42;02:01:43;"So I can see in your eye"
02:01:43;02:01:44;"that you're fed up."
02:01:44;02:01:46;"They know that we a problem together."
02:01:46;02:01:47;"They know that we can"
02:01:47;02:01:48;"stomp anywhere."
02:01:48;02:01:49;"It's bigger than black and white."
02:01:49;02:01:50;"It's a problem"
02:01:50;02:01:51;"with the whole way of life."
02:01:51;02:01:52;"Can't change overnight."
02:01:52;02:01:54;"But we gotta start somewhere."
02:01:54;02:01:55;"Might as well go ahead"
02:01:55;02:01:56;"and start here."
02:01:56;02:01:57;"We done had a hell of a year."
02:01:57;02:01:58;"I'ma make it count"
02:01:58;02:01:59;"while I'm here."
02:01:59;02:02:00;"God is the only man"
02:02:00;02:02:01;"I fear."
02:02:01;02:02:02;"Damn."
02:02:02;02:02:03;"Heavy."
02:02:03;02:02:05;"Maybe we just look at the chorus."
02:02:05;02:02:07;"It's bigger than black and white."
02:02:07;02:02:08;"It's a problem"
02:02:08;02:02:09;"with the whole way of life."
02:02:09;02:02:10;"Systemic."
02:02:10;02:02:11;"It can't change overnight,"
02:02:11;02:02:12;"but we gotta start somewhere."
02:02:12;02:02:13;"Might as well go"
02:02:13;02:02:14;"ahead and start here."
02:02:14;02:02:15;"We had a hell of a year."
02:02:15;02:02:16;"I'ma make it count"
02:02:16;02:02:17;"while I'm still here."
02:02:17;02:02:18;"While I'm here,"
02:02:18;02:02:20;"God is the only man I fear."
02:02:20;02:02:21;"It's heavy, man."
02:02:21;02:02:22;"Good song."
02:02:22;02:02:23;"Yeah."
02:02:23;02:02:25;"Looking at some other lyrics."
02:02:25;02:02:27;"They training officers to kill us"
02:02:27;02:02:28;"than shooting protesters"
02:02:28;02:02:29;"with these rubber bullets."
02:02:29;02:02:30;"The regular people,"
02:02:30;02:02:31;"I know that they feel it."
02:02:31;02:02:33;"These scars too deep to heal us."
02:02:33;02:02:34;"What happened to COVID?"
02:02:34;02:02:35;"Nobody remember."
02:02:35;02:02:36;"We get it."
02:02:36;02:02:37;"The system is wicked."
02:02:37;02:02:39;"Just learn how to pick it."
02:02:39;02:02:40;"Heavy."
02:02:40;02:02:41;"Well,"
02:02:41;02:02:42;"I mean,"
02:02:42;02:02:43;"maybe we end that note"
02:02:43;02:02:45;"just to tie things up."
02:02:45;02:02:47;"It's an interesting moment"
02:02:47;02:02:49;"because clearly the protests"
02:02:49;02:02:50;"and the attention paid"
02:02:50;02:02:52;"to the police violence"
02:02:52;02:02:54;"seems to be making a difference."
02:02:54;02:02:55;"How do you guys feel?"
02:02:55;02:02:58;"Are you optimistic, pessimistic,"
02:02:58;02:03:01;"brutalized by this weird year?"
02:03:01;02:03:02;"Or do you feel like"
02:03:02;02:03:05;"that something's truly been changing"
02:03:05;02:03:07;"and might be heading in a good direction?"
02:03:07;02:03:09;"Jury's still out."
02:03:09;02:03:11;"I think it's too early to tell."
02:03:11;02:03:12;"I mean,"
02:03:12;02:03:14;"there's definitely more sustained attention"
02:03:14;02:03:16;"and energy around this"
02:03:16;02:03:17;"than past times."
02:03:17;02:03:19;"And it seems like"
02:03:19;02:03:21;"Trump is kind of on the ropes."
02:03:21;02:03:22;"And I'm always very skeptical"
02:03:22;02:03:23;"when anybody's like,"
02:03:23;02:03:24;"""Oh, yeah, Trump."
02:03:24;02:03:25;"He's..."""
02:03:25;02:03:26;"I mean, it's been crazy."
02:03:26;02:03:27;"We've had four years of people saying"
02:03:27;02:03:28;"that it's a wrap for Trump."
02:03:28;02:03:30;"Like, he's not going to wriggle his way"
02:03:30;02:03:31;"out of this one."
02:03:31;02:03:34;"But COVID is obviously"
02:03:34;02:03:36;"something really extreme"
02:03:36;02:03:38;"that nobody was counting on."
02:03:38;02:03:39;"So,"
02:03:39;02:03:41;"I do think it's possible he could lose."
02:03:41;02:03:42;"I gotta say,"
02:03:42;02:03:43;"I don't always mean to be like"
02:03:43;02:03:45;"just beating up on the Democrats."
02:03:45;02:03:46;"I do think"
02:03:46;02:03:47;"there's a very big difference."
02:03:47;02:03:49;"I'm not, you know, like..."
02:03:49;02:03:51;"The infamous Rage Against the Machine video"
02:03:51;02:03:53;"where George W. Bush and Al Gore"
02:03:53;02:03:55;"morphed into one face."
02:03:55;02:03:57;"That came out in 2000,"
02:03:57;02:03:58;"before the election."
02:03:58;02:04:00;"Sometimes people point to that as like,"
02:04:00;02:04:02;"""See, man?"
02:04:02;02:04:04;"People were being too hard"
02:04:04;02:04:05;"on the Democrats."
02:04:05;02:04:07;"People were voting for Ralph Nader."
02:04:07;02:04:08;"Fans like Rage Against the Machine"
02:04:08;02:04:09;"were like,"
02:04:09;02:04:11;"""You know, you have no choice here."""
02:04:11;02:04:13;"And they're really hard, but like..."
02:04:13;02:04:14;"I don't believe that everybody's"
02:04:14;02:04:15;"exactly the same."
02:04:15;02:04:16;"I do think, obviously,"
02:04:16;02:04:17;"you look at their platforms,"
02:04:17;02:04:19;"you look at the judges they appoint,"
02:04:19;02:04:20;"there are fundamental differences"
02:04:20;02:04:21;"and important differences"
02:04:21;02:04:23;"between the Democrats and the Republicans."
02:04:23;02:04:25;"But having said that,"
02:04:25;02:04:26;"it's always a bad situation"

02:04:28;02:04:30;"when there's only two games in town."
02:04:30;02:04:31;"And I do think"
02:04:31;02:04:33;"for everybody who's been"
02:04:33;02:04:35;"inspired and marching,"
02:04:35;02:04:36;"and especially for"
02:04:36;02:04:37;"white people,"
02:04:37;02:04:38;"like us,"
02:04:38;02:04:40;"and I'm sure some of our listeners"

02:04:43;02:04:44;"what you can do"
02:04:44;02:04:46;"to help make the world a better place"
02:04:46;02:04:47;"and a less racist place,"
02:04:47;02:04:49;"obviously some of that comes from"
02:04:49;02:04:51;"just what we do in our own lives."
02:04:51;02:04:52;"My hope..."
02:04:52;02:04:54;"I'm speaking of myself too, but..."
