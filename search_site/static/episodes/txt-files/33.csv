00:00;00:05;"It's the final time crisis of 2016."
00:05;00:10;"I don't want to dwell on the past, I want to look to the future."
00:10;00:15;"So we're going to bring together Time Crisis East and West to heal some wounds."
00:15;00:18;"We got Despot, Jonah Hill, and Jake Longstreth."
00:18;00:24;"We're going to talk to Connor Kilpatrick about what a socialist Christmas will look like."
00:24;00:27;"All this, plus the biggest songs of the year."
00:27;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
00:31;00:33;"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep."
00:33;00:34;"Sport!"
00:34;00:35;"One."
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:41;00:48;"The war I fell to, I believe, all my rightful chances."
00:48;00:56;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:56;01:03;"And so I dealt to the floor, when the boss had to go."
01:03;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:13;01:18;"Leave the lonely bare."
01:18;01:20;"Welcome to Time Crisis."
01:20;01:24;"This is the final time crisis of 2016."
01:24;01:27;"So as always, we have Jake in the building."
01:27;01:28;"What's up, Jake?"
01:28;01:29;"Hey."
01:29;01:32;"But we decided to mix things up, because this is a crazy year."
01:32;01:33;"Nothing makes sense anymore."
01:33;01:37;"So we're combining Time Crisis East with Time Crisis West."
01:37;01:41;"So from Time Crisis East, we have Deathspot."
01:41;01:42;"What's up, Deathspot?"
01:42;01:43;"Hi there."
01:43;01:46;"We also got Jonah Hill, who's more known as a Time Crisis East guy."
01:46;01:47;"That's true."
01:47;01:49;"Wait, why are you more East, not West?"
01:49;01:51;"Hold on a sec, who's that voice?"
01:51;01:52;"The audience doesn't even know."
01:52;01:54;"The audience doesn't even know."
01:54;01:56;"A voice just jumped in."
01:56;01:59;"People, who is that?"
01:59;02:02;"That's a special guest we have for five minutes."
02:02;02:05;"His name is Michael Diamond, a.k.a. Mike D."
02:05;02:06;"What's up, Mike D?"
02:06;02:08;"What's up?"
02:08;02:09;"How are you feeling?"
02:09;02:10;"Not bad."
02:10;02:13;"Well, it's the last time crisis of 2016, so it's a little bittersweet."
02:13;02:14;"Yeah?"
02:14;02:15;"It's been quite a wild year."
02:15;02:21;"Today on the show, we're just going to talk about what's going on in the country."
02:21;02:23;"We're going to reflect a little bit on 2016."
02:23;02:26;"And also, we're going to look forward to Christmas."
02:26;02:32;"On our last episode, we talked to a socialist and a conservative."
02:32;02:36;"We decided that our hearts lied a little more with the socialist, so we're going to have him back on."
02:36;02:41;"You know, on Time Crisis, we're very into fast food and snack foods."
02:41;02:47;"And we've been very critical of President-elect Trump on this show."
02:47;02:53;"And we've been critical of some of his cabinet appointments, but there's one that kind of caught our eye."
02:53;02:56;"Jake, you want to tell the people about one of Trump's recent appointments?"
02:56;02:58;"Andrew Puzder?"
02:58;03:00;"Wait, is it Pudzer or Puzder?"
03:00;03:02;"I think it's Puzder."
03:02;03:04;"P-U-Z-D-E-R."
03:04;03:05;"You can call him Andy."
03:05;03:06;"Rolls off the tongue."
03:06;03:07;"Andy Puzder."
03:07;03:08;"Either way, it's a pretty good name."
03:08;03:10;"CEO of CKE Enterprises."
03:10;03:11;"What's that?"
03:11;03:14;"Carl Karcher Enterprises."
03:14;03:18;"Carl Karcher founded Carl's Jr. in the '50s."
03:18;03:20;"So there is a Carl in Carl's Jr."
03:20;03:21;"Yeah, Carl Karcher."
03:21;03:32;"Classic dude from Ohio, served in World War II, moves to SoCal, sees McDonald's popping off, starts Carl's Jr., grows the empire."
03:32;03:41;"And then Puzder is a trial lawyer in St. Louis and somehow bros down with Carl Karcher in his twilight years."
03:41;03:44;"And he became the heir apparent."
03:44;03:45;"Yeah."
03:45;03:48;"Andy, I like you. If there's somebody who's going to keep running my business."
03:48;03:57;"There was an article from Business Insider in March of this year where he was just like, ""I want to replace humans with machines in the workplace."""
03:57;04:01;"And then he becomes appointed the Secretary of Labor, which is..."
04:01;04:03;"That's how things are going right now."
04:03;04:09;"Man. Okay, well, first of all, is Carl's Jr. even good?"
04:09;04:10;"Who's had Carl's Jr. here?"
04:10;04:12;"I have, but I don't remember."
04:12;04:15;"You already know I have, man."
04:15;04:16;"Jonah, what's--"
04:16;04:19;"You have not asked with--you asked with Carl's Jr."
04:19;04:20;"Huh?"
04:20;04:21;"You asked with Carl's Jr."
04:21;04:25;"I was good friends with Carl Sr. a long time ago."
04:25;04:27;"That's the worst joke ever."
04:27;04:29;"That's the stupidest joke ever."
04:29;04:30;"Bless his soul."
04:30;04:34;"I had Carl's Jr. probably for the last time. Like, in high school, we would hit Carl's Jr. a lot."
04:34;04:39;"I thought you were ride or die for Fatburger as a born and raised L.A. guy."
04:39;04:40;"Yeah, yeah."
04:40;04:41;"What happened to that?"
04:41;04:45;"Well, first of all, Apple Pan, if you're from the West Coast, you know what Apple Pan is."
04:45;04:46;"Apple Pan's not fast food."
04:46;04:47;"That's like a chain, is it?"
04:47;04:51;"I don't consider Fatburger fast food because it's made to order, right?"
04:51;04:52;"Mm."
04:52;04:53;"Uh."
04:53;04:54;"Debatable."
04:54;04:56;"But, I mean, it's literally--it's not a drive-thru."
04:56;04:58;"You go in, order, and they make it."
04:58;04:59;"It is a drive-thru."
04:59;05:00;"Nuh-uh."
05:00;05:02;"The Fatburger in Vermont, yeah."
05:02;05:04;"Okay, that one Fatburger is drive-thru."
05:04;05:05;"The rest are not."
05:05;05:08;"So, what do you call--if Fatburger is not fast food--"
05:08;05:09;"That's the Fatburger I know."
05:09;05:10;"What is it?"
05:10;05:11;"It's a hamburger place."
05:11;05:13;"Are all hamburgers fast food?"
05:13;05:16;"You go to Manetta Tavern and you order a hamburger, are you eating fast food?"
05:16;05:17;"No."
05:17;05:18;"Shut the f--- up, then."
05:18;05:19;"Fair enough."
05:19;05:22;"Don't talk to me like that."
05:22;05:25;"Alec, you had my back this whole time."
05:25;05:26;"That's true."
05:26;05:27;"So, what's your take on Carl's Jr.?"
05:27;05:28;"Why'd you stop going there?"
05:28;05:31;"It's not good to eat processed fast food, right?"
05:31;05:33;"So, Carl's Jr. is legitimate fast food?"
05:33;05:36;"Yeah, it's like--that's for sure a fast food place."
05:36;05:39;"But do you respect Andy Puzder for the empire he's helped build?"
05:39;05:41;"I respect him for his name."
05:41;05:42;"Yeah, this is a sick name."
05:42;05:47;"Anyone with the balls to walk around being called Puzder is a dude I respect."
05:47;05:55;"All--you know, I have empathy for the man growing up with the name Puzder, Pudster, whatever it is."
05:55;05:58;"I have never eaten at Carl's Jr. in my life."
05:58;06:02;"I would--why would you--it's like a fourth-tier fast food spot."
06:02;06:03;"I actually would disagree."
06:03;06:05;"It's a lateral move from Burger King."
06:05;06:08;"I would say it's a forward move."
06:08;06:12;"Where's Wendy's at if we're talking tiers?"
06:12;06:15;"Wendy's represents itself as if it's like a fat burger."
06:15;06:19;"You also have Dave from Wendy's as the figurehead."
06:19;06:20;"Guys, let's be real."
06:20;06:23;"Wendy's is half a step up from dog food."
06:23;06:24;"Oh, okay."
06:24;06:28;"How many steps up from dog food is McDonald's?"
06:28;06:30;"Half a step below."
06:30;06:32;"It is dog food."
06:32;06:35;"What is the argument that Carl's Jr. is not fast food?"
06:35;06:39;"I don't think I'd even feed my dog McDonald's."
06:39;06:40;"I think they're all the same."
06:40;06:42;"It's like the exact same thing."
06:42;06:48;"I'm not even trying to be funny, but you know whose dog has definitely been fed McDonald's?"
06:48;06:49;"Suge Knight."
06:49;06:51;"Oh, that's a good one."
06:51;06:52;"I don't know why I went with that."
06:52;06:53;"I'm just saying."
06:53;06:54;"You know what--"
06:54;06:56;"Dancing in the video."
06:56;06:57;"Well, that's the West Coast version."
06:57;07:02;"What East Coast legend has definitely fed his dog McDonald's?"
07:02;07:03;"Howard Stern."

09:39;09:42;"- Anyway, so Andy Puzder,"
09:42;09:45;"as cool as it is what he's done with Carl's Jr."
09:45;09:46;"and Hardee's, right?"
09:46;09:46;"It's the same company?"
09:46;09:47;"- Yeah."
09:47;09:49;"- Hardee's is like a different version."
09:49;09:51;"As cool as it is what he's built"
09:51;09:53;"in terms of brand building,"
09:53;09:55;"we're all people who respect brand building,"
09:55;09:58;"but the idea, I gotta say,"
09:58;10:01;"these scumbag fast food guys,"
10:01;10:05;"it's literally the most abusive mentality."
10:05;10:08;"So this year you had all these minimum wage workers,"
10:08;10:09;"a lot of them in fast food,"
10:09;10:10;"doing the fight for 15."
10:10;10:13;"What's the minimum wage now?"
10:13;10:15;"Is it $7.25 or $8.25?"
10:15;10:16;"- It's state."
10:16;10:18;"- State is 10, federal."
10:18;10:20;"- California, we have a higher."
10:20;10:20;"- Right, so federal minimum wage."
10:20;10:22;"- $7.25 federal."
10:22;10:23;"- $7.25."
10:23;10:27;"So these people are asking for $15 an hour."
10:27;10:29;"And truthfully, when you do the math,"
10:29;10:31;"you really can't live,"
10:31;10:33;"and especially if you're not getting health insurance,"
10:33;10:34;"especially if you have a family,"
10:34;10:35;"you're gonna be in dire straits"
10:35;10:36;"if you actually make $7.25."
10:36;10:39;"You could work 80 hours a week."
10:39;10:41;"So it's a fairly modest ask."
10:41;10:45;"And all these scumbag fast food dudes,"
10:45;10:46;"also it's so funny and abusive"
10:46;10:47;"'cause they're basically like,"
10:47;10:49;"well, guys, yeah, I get it,"
10:49;10:50;"you wanna make $15 an hour,"
10:50;10:53;"but the thing is, if you ask for $15 an hour,"
10:53;10:55;"I'm gonna have to replace you with a robot."
10:55;10:57;"So, you know, it's like,"
10:57;10:58;"they're just abusing them. - Yeah, and they're"
10:58;11:00;"so profitable, too."
11:00;11:00;"- Robots."
11:00;11:01;"- No, those companies."
11:01;11:02;"- Right, well, I mean--"
11:02;11:04;"- Those fast food companies."
11:04;11:06;"- It'll go into hyperdrive if they get robots."
11:06;11:08;"Also, but it's so short-sighted"
11:08;11:10;"because all these rich people,"
11:10;11:13;"the Trumps, the Puzzders,"
11:13;11:14;"all of these people."
11:14;11:17;"- How rich are the Puzzders, comparatively?"
11:17;11:18;"Like Trump?"
11:18;11:19;"- Carl's Jr. money?"
11:19;11:21;"Well, nobody knows how much money Trump does."
11:21;11:23;"- He's the owner of Carl's Jr.?"
11:23;11:24;"- CEO. - CEO."
11:24;11:25;"- Okay, he's paid."
11:25;11:26;"- He's paid."
11:26;11:27;"If they put all these people out of business"
11:27;11:28;"and replace them with robots,"
11:28;11:30;"okay, you're gonna make a little extra money"
11:30;11:31;"in the meantime."
11:31;11:33;"What are you gonna do when there's millions"
11:33;11:35;"of angry, starving people around the country?"
11:35;11:37;"You dummies."
11:37;11:39;"They're gonna come for you, Puzzder."
11:39;11:42;"- You sick the angry, starving robots on them."
11:42;11:43;"- They're gonna need some robots."
11:43;11:45;"- Right, well, and the robots are gonna get,"
11:45;11:47;"they're gonna have their own artificial intelligence."
11:47;11:48;"- Yeah."
11:48;11:51;"- Also, robots notoriously don't know"
11:51;11:53;"about Chicken McNuggets"
11:53;11:54;"and how they're supposed to be cooked."
11:54;11:57;"- Yeah, they're gonna overcook those burgers."
11:57;12:00;"- Also, the quality's definitely gonna go down."
12:00;12:01;"- Will it?"
12:01;12:03;"(laughing)"
12:03;12:03;"- You know what, though?"
12:03;12:05;"The only thing is robots can't be,"
12:05;12:06;"well, they can be disgruntled,"
12:06;12:09;"but they don't have fluid to put into the food."
12:09;12:10;"- They could throw it on the floor."
12:10;12:12;"- That's true, that's true."
12:12;12:13;"- The floor is probably mad clean, though."
12:13;12:15;"- Oh, yeah. - It's just robots."
12:15;12:16;"- You're just saying that an angry robot"
12:16;12:17;"can't spit in your burger."
12:17;12:20;"- So people who are mistreated at fast food restaurants"
12:20;12:21;"probably (beep) with food, right?"
12:21;12:23;"Who are treated by customers and staff,"
12:23;12:26;"and supervisors."
12:26;12:27;"- They definitely do."
12:27;12:28;"- If you piss a robot off,"
12:28;12:31;"they don't have spit to put into your food."
12:31;12:33;"(laughing)"
12:33;12:33;"- Not yet."
12:33;12:35;"- Yeah, but they might just come out"
12:35;12:36;"to straight up attack you."
12:36;12:38;"They might chop your (beep) off."
12:38;12:39;"- That's true, and like Alec says,"
12:39;12:41;"they might just, you know,"
12:41;12:42;"there's other ways to get stuff dirty."
12:42;12:43;"- They'll throw it on the floor, yeah."
12:43;12:44;"- Toilet, toilet."
12:44;12:48;"- Can I pose an existential socialist quandary?"
12:48;12:49;"- Yeah."
12:49;12:50;"- These jobs that we're talking about"
12:50;12:52;"in the fast food industry,"
12:52;12:53;"they're crappy jobs."
12:53;12:56;"I wouldn't wish them on anybody."
12:56;12:57;"You know what I mean?"
12:57;12:58;"Like anybody that does it,"
12:58;13:00;"I hope they're able to find something"
13:00;13:02;"that they love doing better,"
13:02;13:05;"and are able to make it work doing that."
13:05;13:07;"'Cause they're being treated like (beep)"
13:07;13:09;"they're not getting paid."
13:09;13:11;"They're getting paid like crap."
13:11;13:13;"And it's very--"
13:13;13:15;"- Generally, it's considered a rough gig."
13:15;13:16;"- It's a very hard existence."
13:16;13:18;"So shouldn't we, as a society anyway,"
13:18;13:21;"be trying to uplift these people out of these jobs?"
13:21;13:23;"And then in that sense,"
13:23;13:26;"if we're having a robot do this job,"
13:26;13:28;"and we can actually motivate people,"
13:28;13:31;"or retrain, or whatever the method is"
13:31;13:33;"to uplift people out of that--"
13:33;13:34;"- I'm with you."
13:34;13:35;"I'm with you."
13:35;13:37;"And I wanna ask our socialist guest,"
13:37;13:38;"Connor Kilpatrick, this later,"
13:38;13:41;"but if in fact our technology's getting so good"
13:41;13:43;"that we don't have to make people"
13:43;13:44;"stand over a griddle all day,"
13:44;13:46;"you're right, that's not necessarily a bad thing,"
13:46;13:48;"but say there aren't jobs for those people."
13:48;13:50;"Are we gonna take care of those people,"
13:50;13:51;"show them basic dignity,"
13:51;13:52;"give them healthcare and stuff?"
13:52;13:54;"That's the socialist vision."
13:54;13:56;"The Donald Trump vision is probably gonna leave"
13:56;13:58;"those people out in the streets."
13:58;13:59;"And that's not good for anybody."
13:59;14:02;"Trump, Puzder, these dudes,"
14:02;14:04;"if you cornered them, you really got their real take"
14:04;14:06;"on what they think of average,"
14:06;14:08;"hardworking Carl's Jr. employees."
14:08;14:11;"I bet you would hear some gnarly stuff."
14:11;14:12;"- Oh, I'm sure."
14:12;14:15;"- And I know people are gonna bid a fair,"
14:15;14:18;"happy rest of 2016,"
14:18;14:21;"and 2017, a time crisis."
14:21;14:22;"- The legendary-- - The full panel,"
14:22;14:23;"east and west."
14:23;14:25;"- Legendary-- - And I think it's very strong,"
14:25;14:26;"by the way, I just wanna interject that"
14:26;14:28;"now you guys really united,"
14:28;14:31;"with this very controversial year."
14:31;14:32;"- Like Wu-Tang, kind of."
14:32;14:33;"- You helped us all heal right now."
14:33;14:35;"- Like the Wu-Tang song, ""Reunited."""
14:35;14:36;"- Time crisis shows a united front."
14:36;14:40;"Well, so thank you very much to legendary rapper,"
14:40;14:44;"businessman, radio show host, and noted socialist,"
14:44;14:47;"Michael Diamond, Mike D of the Beastie Boys."
14:47;14:48;"Thanks for coming through."
14:48;14:49;"- Hey, hit Carl's Jr. on the way home."

18:13;18:14;"Time Crisis"
18:14;18:16;"on Beast One."
18:16;18:18;"- So bad news for Coke and Pepsi."
18:18;18:20;"There's some new data coming out"
18:20;18:22;"about who's actually drinking them."
18:22;18:25;"And it's kind of interesting."
18:25;18:28;"Coke's largest audience is 35 to 44."
18:28;18:30;"- Drinkership, it's called."
18:30;18:32;"- They're drinkership."
18:32;18:35;"Coke is killing it with the 35 to 44 year olds."
18:35;18:37;"That's such a weird demographic."
18:37;18:41;"Does that just mean like kind of new parents?"
18:41;18:42;"- That's cocaine."
18:42;18:43;"- Oh, that's cocaine."
18:43;18:44;"(laughing)"
18:44;18:46;"- Yeah, you gotta stay up for the babies."
18:46;18:47;"I'm right in that demo."
18:47;18:51;"- Yeah, so Coke's killing it with the 35 to 44 year olds."
18:51;18:53;"Where do you guys think Pepsi does the best?"
18:53;18:56;"- One to six year olds."
18:56;18:57;"- Oh, that's a bad parenting."
18:57;19:00;"- Like I would say 12."
19:00;19:02;"- No, I'm gonna say older."
19:02;19:03;"- I think old people."
19:03;19:04;"- You're right."
19:04;19:08;"So Pepsi's biggest audience drinkership is 65 and over."
19:08;19:09;"- 65?"
19:09;19:11;"- I know, doesn't that seem so backwards?"
19:11;19:14;"Well, and the real bad news is that they're both tanking"
19:14;19:17;"in the 18 to 24 year old demographic."
19:17;19:19;"And I don't have to tell you guys"
19:19;19:23;"that when a soda tanks with 18 to 24 year olds,"
19:23;19:27;"it's bad that you're missing out on the profits"
19:27;19:28;"of those college students and young people."
19:28;19:30;"- Oh, 'cause it's Red Bull, right?"
19:30;19:31;"- I guess they're drinking Red Bull,"
19:31;19:33;"but that also means these people are gonna grow up."
19:33;19:36;"They might never even get into Coke or Pepsi."
19:36;19:37;"But you know what surprises me though,"
19:37;19:42;"is Coke, just to talk about branding and marketing strategy,"
19:42;19:44;"which is basically all that ""Time Crisis"" is about"
19:44;19:47;"for foods that will ultimately kill you."
19:47;19:51;"Coke, we think of, it's like the heritage brand, right?"
19:51;19:52;"Coke is old school."
19:52;19:53;"- Mumford and Sons."
19:53;19:56;"- It's Mumford and Sons, it's Polar Bears,"
19:56;19:58;"it's Christmas, it's America."
19:58;20:01;"Whereas Pepsi is always really trying hard"
20:01;20:03;"to kind of seem youthful."
20:03;20:04;"Like in the '80s, they were like,"
20:04;20:05;"""We're the Pepsi generation."""
20:05;20:09;"- Yeah, Michael Jackson, Crystal Pepsi."
20:09;20:11;"- Crystal Pepsi, Crystal Castles."
20:11;20:14;"Pepsi's always been trying so hard,"
20:14;20:15;"'cause it's kind of funny."
20:15;20:16;"- Yo, they have a club."
20:16;20:18;"They just opened a club in New York, you know about that?"
20:18;20:19;"- Wait, Pepsi opened a club?"
20:19;20:22;"- Pepsi is called the Cola Room, and it's with a K."
20:22;20:23;"- We gotta go."
20:23;20:24;"- We gotta go."
20:24;20:25;"- Have you been yet?"
20:25;20:26;"- Cola House, my bad."
20:26;20:27;"(all laughing)"
20:27;20:28;"- Who the fuck would go there"
20:28;20:30;"if you're not making fun of it?"
20:30;20:31;"Like, you know what I mean?"
20:31;20:33;"The only reason to go is to be an (beep)"
20:33;20:33;"with your friends and be like,"
20:33;20:35;"""We're at the Pepsi nightclub."""
20:35;20:38;"- You get like a big bottle of Pepsi in an ice bucket."
20:38;20:41;"- Are they serving booze? - Like light sparklers?"
20:41;20:42;"- I think maybe it's more of a restaurant."
20:42;20:45;"It sounds like it's kind of a bar and grill."
20:45;20:47;"They're almost trying to present it"
20:47;20:50;"as if it's like some farm-to-table thing."
20:50;20:53;"So, the aptly named Cola House will feature drinks"
20:53;20:56;"by Alex Ott, aka Dr. Cocktail."
20:56;20:57;"- Oh yeah, that guy."
20:57;20:59;"Doc Cock, they call him."
20:59;21:00;"(all laughing)"
21:00;21:05;"- And serve artisanal plates also inspired by the cola nut."
21:05;21:07;"By the way, the nuts come from the cola tree,"
21:07;21:08;"native to Africa."
21:08;21:10;"I'm like, ""Oh, I like that."""
21:11;21:14;"Oh, the cool factor, Live Nation will plan concerts"
21:14;21:16;"and events in this intimate setting."
21:16;21:18;"And rocker Lenny Kravitz has had a hand"
21:18;21:20;"in adding glam to the look and feel of this eatery."
21:20;21:22;"- Oh my God. - Wow."
21:22;21:23;"- I'm into it."
21:23;21:25;"- Alec, you just kind of dropped one"
21:25;21:29;"of the most time crisis perfect stories on our lap."
21:29;21:30;"It's got everything."
21:30;21:32;"It's got music and Lenny Kravitz."
21:32;21:33;"- An intimate evening with Lenny Kravitz."
21:33;21:34;"- Oh, but for real."
21:34;21:36;"(all laughing)"
21:36;21:37;"No, no, no, no, but it's saying Lenny,"
21:37;21:39;"'cause actually, to be fair to Lenny Kravitz,"
21:39;21:42;"as Kanye has pointed out back in the day,"
21:42;21:44;"a lot of people think of Lenny as just a rocker,"
21:44;21:47;"but he's very known for his interior decorating skills."
21:47;21:47;"That's not a joke."
21:47;21:48;"- News to me."
21:48;21:49;"- You didn't know that?"
21:49;21:50;"- I didn't know that either. - I thought you were"
21:50;21:51;"like a rock guy."
21:51;21:53;"- I'm not a Kravitz guy."
21:53;21:54;"- Oh."
21:54;21:55;"- Kravitz is the worst."
21:55;21:56;"- Shout out, shout out."
21:56;21:57;"Oh man."
21:57;21:57;"- You in?"
21:57;22:01;"- Well, when his dick came out of the pants,"
22:01;22:03;"that really-- - And he had a ring on,"
22:03;22:04;"right, didn't he?"
22:04;22:04;"- Oh, was that?"
22:04;22:06;"- I think maybe I didn't look at the picture"
22:06;22:07;"for that long, Alec."
22:07;22:09;"- I looked at it for a really long time"
22:09;22:10;"and I blew it up. - The vine."
22:10;22:12;"Yeah, the vine was incredible."
22:12;22:14;"- Yeah, 'cause it never stops,"
22:14;22:14;"so you could just keep--"
22:14;22:15;"- Well, look."
22:15;22:17;"(laughing)"
22:17;22:22;"Bringing some of that raw, rugged,"
22:22;22:24;"East Coast Tom Crisis flavor"
22:24;22:27;"to the normally mellow West Coast office."
22:27;22:29;"I wanna talk about Cola House a little more"
22:29;22:31;"because it's such a great story."
22:31;22:33;"You know, in the same way that people never thought"
22:33;22:36;"that a reality show con man like Trump"
22:36;22:38;"could become president,"
22:38;22:40;"I don't think it's impossible that Cola House"
22:40;22:42;"could become one of New York's hottest restaurants."
22:42;22:45;"Like, all these old divisions are kinda crumbling."
22:45;22:46;"Like, just imagine-- - Interesting point."
22:46;22:48;"- I just think like maybe, you know,"
22:48;22:51;"it gets like four stars in the New York Times"
22:51;22:53;"and it's just kinda like, you know, I gotta admit,"
22:53;22:56;"I never thought that a Pepsi-sponsored theme restaurant"
22:56;22:57;"would actually have great food,"
22:57;22:59;"but I gotta say-- - Stuffed squash was great."
22:59;23:00;"- It was actually good,"
23:00;23:01;"and I'm not trying to be a snob here."
23:01;23:02;"- Stuffed Cola Nut."
23:02;23:04;"- There's a Mountain Dew brothel that's very interesting"
23:04;23:06;"that just opened up. (laughing)"
23:06;23:07;"- Yeah, and Jackson Heights."
23:07;23:10;"- And Jackson Heights. (laughing)"

23:56;23:57;"- Who here's ever been to Trump Tower?"
23:57;23:59;"- Oh, I have. - I have too."
23:59;24:01;"- Why did you guys go to Trump Tower?"
24:01;24:03;"Who goes first?"
24:03;24:03;"Jonah."
24:03;24:06;"- I was meeting with a dude who lived there."
24:06;24:08;"- Just straight up lived in Trump Tower."
24:08;24:10;"- If I'm thinking of the right place, yeah."
24:10;24:12;"- Fifth Avenue and 55th."
24:12;24:13;"- Yeah."
24:13;24:15;"- Starbucks in the lobby."
24:15;24:17;"- Yeah, and we shot there one time."
24:17;24:19;"- Have you ever met Donald?"
24:19;24:19;"- Nope."
24:19;24:21;"- Have you ever been close to him?"
24:21;24:22;"- Not that I know of, no."
24:22;24:23;"- Ivanka?"
24:23;24:24;"- Nope."
24:24;24:26;"- Donald Jr.?"
24:26;24:27;"- D3. (laughing)"
24:27;24:29;"His grandson, I'm homies with."
24:29;24:31;"- So Jonah, you were telling me about D3."
24:31;24:32;"- I'm obsessed with D3."
24:32;24:32;"- We haven't heard a lot about it."
24:32;24:34;"- Do you know D3?"
24:34;24:35;"- Who is D3?"
24:35;24:37;"- Donald Jr.'s son is like a little ass baby."
24:37;24:41;"He's like two, and they call him D3, which is so hard."
24:41;24:43;"(laughing)"
24:43;24:44;"- That's video."
24:44;24:47;"- And he's just like another one of those, you know."
24:47;24:50;"- Yo, that's really crazy when you keep the same name"
24:50;24:51;"in the family because--"
24:51;24:52;"- Sounds like he plays for the Clippers."
24:52;24:54;"Like, it sounds like CP3, you know,"
24:54;24:55;"like Chris Paul or something."
24:55;24:57;"- It totally sounds like an athlete."
24:57;25:00;"D3."
25:00;25:02;"Yeah, just like a big D3 T-shirt."
25:02;25:06;"- What's crazy is, I'm not trying to be too pessimistic,"
25:06;25:08;"but a lot of people are nervous"
25:08;25:10;"that we're currently experiencing"
25:10;25:12;"the death throes of American democracy."
25:12;25:16;"So say, it's also creepy to think that if Trump"
25:16;25:19;"actually did establish some sort of like, you know,"
25:19;25:23;"Putin-esque situation where he basically"
25:23;25:26;"just holds onto power, if he wanted to,"
25:26;25:28;"he could then, when he had to step down,"
25:28;25:31;"he could make Don Jr. president,"
25:31;25:33;"and then eventually D3, and there could be--"
25:33;25:34;"- What about Eric?"
25:34;25:36;"- Well, if I was him, I'd rather have 80 years"
25:36;25:38;"of Donald Trump presidents."
25:38;25:40;"You guys have the same name over and over again."
25:40;25:42;"- Like Louis XIV."
25:42;25:43;"- Exactly."
25:43;25:44;"- D3 looks ill."
25:44;25:45;"He's got braces."
25:45;25:46;"He's not happy."
25:46;25:48;"- Oh, D3, he's a little cutie."
25:48;25:51;"You can't, it's not fair to be mean to politicians' kids."
25:51;25:52;"- Well, actually, you know what I was thinking"
25:52;25:55;"is like that kid or the kid that everyone's like,"
25:55;25:57;"giving a hard time for like, being sleepy"
25:57;25:58;"at the election or whatever."
25:58;25:59;"- Barron."
26:00;26:01;"- It'd be really dope if one of those kids ends up--"
26:01;26:03;"- Whose kid is that, Donald's kid?"
26:03;26:04;"- That's his, with Melania."
26:04;26:06;"- It'd be really dope if one of those kids"
26:06;26:09;"ends up really like, indie and cool, kind of."
26:09;26:11;"That would be a major like, cool thing."
26:11;26:11;"- D3 could do it."
26:11;26:12;"I think he's--"
26:12;26:13;"- In like 40 years, he's--"
26:13;26:16;"- D3's like goth, like he listens to prayers."
26:16;26:17;"- Right."
26:17;26:18;"(laughing)"
26:18;26:21;"- In like 40 years, he's like a really progressive Democrat."
26:21;26:21;"- Right."
26:21;26:24;"- Running for office, condemning his grandfather's"
26:24;26:26;"terrible policies from 40 years."
26:26;26:28;"- Yeah, stuff like that happens."
26:28;26:30;"- Ezra, what if Donald Trump just comes out"
26:30;26:33;"and he's like, only thing I work out to is Vampire Weekend."
26:33;26:34;"- Oh God."
26:34;26:35;"(laughing)"
26:35;26:36;"- Yo, that reminds me."
26:36;26:38;"- On my playlist, all Vampire Weekend."
26:38;26:41;"- This kid, Rost, RFC, who's like,"
26:41;26:44;"kinda legendary graffiti writer in New York"
26:44;26:45;"and like, bad guy."
26:45;26:49;"Like, he just did a lot of bad stuff when he was younger."
26:49;26:53;"Now he's like, an older guy and he raps and stuff."
26:53;26:55;"He tweeted at me out of nowhere and he was like,"
26:55;26:57;"yo, you did a song with Vampire Weekend?"
26:57;26:58;"And I was like, yeah."
26:58;27:01;"And he was like, that's my favorite band."
27:01;27:02;"- Really?"
27:02;27:04;"- And I was really surprised by that."
27:04;27:05;"- A really bad guy."
27:05;27:08;"- He has this big scar on his face and he, you know,"
27:08;27:10;"did his fair share of jail time."
27:10;27:13;"But he's a pretty good rapper now, do you know what I think?"
27:13;27:14;"- Wow."
27:14;27:15;"- Isn't Eric Trump a huge fan?"
27:15;27:16;"- Eric Trump?"
27:16;27:17;"- Yeah."
27:17;27:20;"- No, the only Republican I've ever remotely heard"
27:20;27:22;"about being a fan is--"
27:22;27:24;"- He's just a fan of Ezra, like, he just thinks"
27:24;27:25;"Ezra's cool."
27:25;27:26;"- He's big time Chris's fan."
27:26;27:27;"- He's just my guy."
27:27;27:28;"- Eric Trump, he's my guy."
27:28;27:32;"The person who was acting as Jeb Bush's PR person,"
27:32;27:34;"or what do you call it, director of communications"
27:34;27:38;"during the election, was kind of like a youngish guy."
27:38;27:41;"And this guy met my sister at some point"
27:41;27:43;"and I actually went clear there with him,"
27:43;27:44;"I got nothing against him."
27:44;27:47;"So he was working for Jeb and this was at the height"
27:47;27:49;"of the Republican primary."
27:49;27:52;"And he tweeted at me, and I wasn't quite sure"
27:52;27:54;"if it was real, he was just like, oh hey,"
27:54;27:56;"I see you're out there supporting Bernie."
27:56;27:58;"Well man, if you ever change your tune,"
27:58;28:01;"I just played some Vampire Weekend for Jeb"
28:01;28:03;"and he said it was pretty cool, or something."
28:03;28:04;"(laughing)"
28:04;28:06;"- That's mild praise."
28:06;28:07;"- Yeah."
28:07;28:09;"I can totally picture Jeb too."
28:09;28:10;"- He didn't tell me to turn it off."
28:10;28:13;"- He was playing and he was like, I like this band,"
28:13;28:14;"check 'em out, what do you think?"
28:14;28:16;"I could tweet at the guy and he's like,"
28:16;28:19;"this is pretty cool, I like this, it's cool."
28:19;28:21;"And so then, you know, at the time I was out there"
28:21;28:23;"supporting Bernie, so I'd really seem like a real"
28:23;28:25;"piece of shit if I didn't even go to Hillary,"
28:25;28:27;"I started supporting Jeb."
28:27;28:29;"So I think I said something like, hey,"
28:29;28:31;"I don't remember, just something kind of cheeky,"
28:31;28:34;"like, I would love to support Jeb if he renounces"
28:34;28:35;"his brother and goes full socialist."
28:35;28:36;"You know, just something like that."
28:36;28:37;"- Yeah, yeah."
28:37;28:40;"- And that was that, and then later somehow"
28:40;28:43;"this guy met my sister, and he,"
28:43;28:45;"maybe he implied to her, like he didn't know"
28:45;28:47;"how to take it."
28:47;28:48;"And I guess I could imagine that,"
28:48;28:50;"you're just like a young Republican guy"
28:50;28:52;"just out there trying to get Jeb Bush elected."
28:52;28:52;"- Very earnest."
28:52;28:54;"- Yeah, maybe he was being earnest and he felt"
28:54;28:56;"like I was being too cheeky, 'cause the truth is,"
28:56;28:58;"obviously, you know, I'm not a Republican,"
28:58;28:59;"I've never supported a Republican."
28:59;29:04;"So I wanna say to that guy, thank you for being a fan."
29:04;29:09;"Sorry, that must have been tough working for Jeb,"
29:09;29:11;"because Trump just savaged him throughout the election,"
29:11;29:12;"I know that was probably hard."
29:12;29:14;"I want you to know, no hard feelings."
29:14;29:18;"And I hope one day you'll come support the lefties."

33:37;33:44;"You're listening to Time Crisis on Beast1"
33:44;33:47;"Maybe on that note, is it time to start talking about socialism?"
33:47;33:52;"I think we got a pretty good response on the last episode talking about socialism"
33:52;33:52;"Did we?"
33:52;33:55;"Yeah, I saw a handful of tweets"
33:55;33:58;"You saw like four tweets"
33:58;34:01;"I saw four tweets and my mom said that it was pretty good"
34:01;34:02;"Is your mom a listener?"
34:02;34:04;"I think she listens every week"
34:04;34:04;"Wow"
34:04;34:09;"And also I just kind of felt like obviously like remember when we got in here right after the election"
34:09;34:12;"And we just had to talk about like what is happening in the world we feel so dark"
34:12;34:16;"We made a promise to ourselves that we were not gonna forget that feeling"
34:16;34:21;"And we were gonna try to maintain optimism and educate ourselves and do things you know in the future"
34:21;34:25;"And we looked at our options, we had socialists and conservatives"
34:25;34:28;"Obviously liberals are not too enticing at the moment"
34:28;34:29;"And I think the socialist guy made a point"
34:29;34:32;"So I want to just keep bringing him back to talk about things"
34:32;34:35;"But while you guys are here because you weren't on the last episode"
34:35;34:39;"I'm curious, would you guys ever be socialists?"
34:39;34:39;"Yeah"
34:39;34:43;"I need a brief explanation of like what exactly that entails"
34:43;34:47;"I know the basic definition of socialism"
34:47;34:48;"But what does that mean for me?"
34:48;34:49;"To be one"
34:49;34:50;"To be one"
34:50;34:50;"Yeah"
34:50;34:53;"Okay I guess do you, just in the most general sense"
34:53;34:59;"Do you believe it's the government's responsibility to minimize inequality between people"
34:59;35:01;"And provide a safety net for everybody?"
35:01;35:03;"You're not asking do you believe that"
35:03;35:06;"No you're asking would you at some point believe that"
35:06;35:07;"Oh no do you believe that?"
35:07;35:08;"Oh"
35:08;35:08;"I don't know"
35:08;35:10;"You might not be a socialist"
35:10;35:12;"You might not be a socialist"
35:12;35:13;"What do you mean?"
35:13;35:14;"I mean like"
35:14;35:18;"Like meaning that the government decides that everything is equal and all"
35:18;35:19;"Like they are in charge"
35:19;35:20;"Let's not say totally equal"
35:20;35:24;"Let's just say do you think there should be a baseline for taking care of people in the country"
35:24;35:28;"That if you're an American citizen you deserve certain things like universal health care"
35:29;35:31;"Some kind of basic living wage"
35:31;35:34;"That nobody deserves to die in the street in a rich country"
35:34;35:35;"I mean of course I think that"
35:35;35:37;"You might be a socialist"
35:37;35:38;"What about"
35:38;35:41;"But I imagine it's not as clear cut as that"
35:41;35:44;"Oh you'd be surprised my friend"
35:44;35:47;"No yeah you're right of course in practice these things get more complicated"
35:47;35:50;"Do you think that it's important for there to be labor unions"
35:50;35:52;"And for workers to be able to collectively bargain for"
35:52;35:56;"Better wages and better conditions and things like that"
35:56;35:56;"Yes"
35:56;35:58;"All right"
35:58;36:01;"I think giving the government that power is scary though to regulate that"
36:01;36:04;"That is especially in look at our government like"
36:04;36:08;"I just think these things are all so perception based"
36:08;36:08;"You know what I mean?"
36:08;36:10;"I don't think that there's like"
36:10;36:12;"Right so at the very least philosophically"
36:12;36:18;"Would you be okay if a president or a party that you felt like you could more or less trust said to you"
36:18;36:20;"We want to jack your taxes up 10-15%"
36:20;36:24;"And we truly are going to put that money towards taking care of people and blah blah blah"
36:24;36:25;"Would you be cool with that conceptually?"
36:25;36:26;"Of course I do"
36:26;36:29;"But then again can you trust them to put that towards the right things"
36:29;36:34;"I think that is the thing that most people would bump up against I think with socialism"
36:34;36:39;"Is trust of the government to actually do the things they're promising to do"
36:39;36:40;"True"
36:40;36:43;"Like in theory of course I would agree with all of this"
36:43;36:48;"And I would be happy to give that percentage of my money to do that"
36:48;36:49;"Right"
36:49;36:51;"Where's the thing?"
36:51;36:53;"We all spend our time thinking about"
36:53;36:56;"You know films, programs"
36:56;36:56;"Songs"
36:56;36:58;"Mixtapes"
36:58;36:59;"Paintings"
36:59;37:00;"We're art boys"
37:00;37:02;"Junior Western Bacon Cheeseburgers"
37:02;37:03;"We're art boys"
37:03;37:05;"Art boys 2016 going on 2017"
37:05;37:06;"Bunch of art boys here"
37:06;37:09;"So that's why we got to call Connor Kilpatrick"
37:09;37:11;"Who writes for a socialist magazine called Jockaban"
37:11;37:14;"And ask him some questions about socialism"
37:14;37:16;"Because it's Christmas time"
37:16;37:19;"My question is what is a socialist Christmas going to be like?"
37:19;37:21;"Because I was raised in a very capitalist society"
37:21;37:23;"Where if you didn't get good presents on Christmas"
37:23;37:26;"If you didn't come back to school after Christmas"
37:26;37:28;"With some new sneakers"
37:28;37:29;"Some British Knights"
37:29;37:31;"Maybe a couple power gloves"
37:31;37:33;"Some new video games"
37:33;37:33;"It was brutal"
37:33;37:35;"My family didn't celebrate Christmas"
37:35;37:38;"But we even had to jack Hanukkah up to just to compete"
37:38;37:42;"So anyway I want to talk about what's a socialist Christmas going to be like"
37:42;37:43;"So can we get Connor on the phone?"
37:43;37:50;"Hello Connor"
37:50;37:50;"Hey"
37:50;37:51;"Hey what's up man?"
37:51;37:54;"You're on Time Crisis yet again"
37:54;37:55;"You're here with me and Jake"
37:55;37:55;"And we got a full house today"
37:55;37:57;"You're also on with Despot and Jonah"
37:57;37:58;"How you doing man?"
37:58;37:59;"I'm doing great"
37:59;38:01;"So we were just talking"
38:01;38:02;"Just four art boys"
38:02;38:07;"Who you know primarily think about rap and movies and paintings"
38:07;38:08;"And things of that nature"
38:08;38:11;"So we're still trying to educate ourselves about socialism"
38:11;38:12;"So we want to have you back"
38:12;38:14;"And so we thought a good way to talk about this"
38:14;38:16;"Because it's Christmas time"
38:16;38:18;"This is the most wonderful time of the year"
38:18;38:21;"We want to ask you what does a socialist Christmas look like?"
38:21;38:27;"A socialist Christmas is basically more people getting to enjoy Christmas"
38:27;38:32;"You know not having to bust their asses on Christmas Eve or Christmas"
38:32;38:36;"And having the money and the time and the freedom"
38:36;38:39;"To buy gifts for loved ones and take time off"
38:39;38:40;"And be able to get together"
38:40;38:44;"If you're someone who's working for 15 bucks an hour"
38:44;38:47;"You're not really having much of a free Christmas"
38:47;38:49;"Even if you can take the time off"
38:49;38:51;"If you can't afford to get gifts for loved ones"
38:51;38:53;"If you can't travel to meet family"
38:53;38:55;"If you don't have the time to do it"
38:55;38:57;"So a socialist Christmas would mean"
38:57;39:00;"More people getting to partake in Christmas if they wanted to"
39:00;39:03;"Okay so in a socialist society"
39:03;39:05;"More people would be able to take Christmas off"
39:05;39:08;"Relax and spend time with their families"
39:08;39:08;"Yeah"
39:08;39:09;"That sounds pretty good"
39:09;39:13;"But probably the most important thing for most people"
39:13;39:17;"Outside of the deeply religious on Christmas is presents"
39:17;39:17;"Yeah"
39:17;39:19;"So in a socialist society"
39:19;39:22;"Will the presents get worse?"
39:22;39:23;"Will you get less presents?"
39:23;39:26;"Will you have to share presents with your brothers and sisters?"
39:26;39:28;"How's that gonna play out?"
39:28;39:32;"Oh no man socialists are pro-consumption"
39:32;39:35;"They're pro everybody getting to have good stuff"
39:35;39:37;"I mean Karl Marx himself wrote about that"
39:37;39:40;"He thought it was a civilizing part of society"
39:40;39:43;"So yeah you know maybe the super rich kids"
39:43;39:45;"Maybe they won't be getting new yachts and sh*t"
39:45;39:52;"But no it would mean that most people would be able to get and give more presents"
39:52;39:54;"So the presents even out"
39:54;39:56;"The level of presents is more even"
39:56;39:57;"Yeah I mean this is the thing"
39:57;40:01;"When you look at American consumption patterns for the past 50 years"
40:01;40:07;"As much as we have this idea that Americans are just buying way more stuff now than they used to"
40:07;40:09;"It's actually not true"
40:09;40:13;"The one really big increase in consumption and spending from American households"
40:13;40:16;"In the past 50 years is medical healthcare spending"
40:16;40:20;"And that's a whole other you know situation"
40:20;40:24;"So yeah I think it's important to remember that socialists aren't like these hair shirt people"
40:24;40:26;"Who don't want people to have stuff"
40:26;40:30;"Or don't think buying stuff and giving people stuff is good"
40:30;40:32;"They just want everybody to be able to do it"
40:32;40:36;"So there would still be like Xbox and PlayStation under socialism?"
40:36;40:37;"Oh hell yeah I mean"
40:37;40:39;"Would there be less games?"
40:39;40:40;"No I don't think so at all"
40:40;40:46;"There's a certain component to consumption that's part of what Marx called a rich individuality"
40:46;40:50;"And part of helping individuality is developing new needs and wants"
40:50;40:52;"Well so Connor you're a socialist"
40:52;40:54;"What are you getting people for Christmas?"
40:54;40:56;"Oh my god I am starting to panic"
40:56;40:57;"I put it off too long"
40:57;41:01;"Do you feel pressure as somebody who really identifies as a socialist"
41:01;41:02;"And works for a socialist magazine"
41:02;41:06;"That your gifts have to have kind of like a socialist flavor?"
41:06;41:09;"No no I definitely don't feel that way"
41:09;41:12;"I definitely do not feel that way at all no"
41:12;41:15;"Can we hear like one example of a gift that you bought someone?"
41:15;41:17;"Anyone?"
41:17;41:18;"I don't want to spoil it"
41:18;41:20;"Well I already got my wife's early present"
41:20;41:20;"Okay"
41:20;41:24;"It was that perfume Jo Malone"
41:24;41:25;"Sounds fancy"
41:25;41:26;"It is pretty fancy"
41:26;41:27;"Okay so how much was that?"
41:27;41:28;"What's the retail?"
41:28;41:31;"The retail? Oh my god it was something like"
41:31;41:32;"I could look it up"
41:32;41:33;"Something"
41:33;41:35;"But so you're saying even in a socialist society"
41:35;41:39;"You can still buy your wife or husband a fancy perfume"
41:39;41:40;"That'll still exist"
41:40;41:43;"But the store might be closed on Christmas Eve"
41:43;41:45;"Yeah I mean the thing I mentioned last time"
41:45;41:49;"It's like socialist beef with markets are with financial markets"
41:49;41:53;"And it's not really with in labor markets"
41:53;41:56;"It's not with you know markets and consumer goods"
41:56;41:58;"Markets and consumer goods existed before capitalism"
41:58;42:00;"So there'd still be Etsy?"
42:00;42:01;"Yeah there'd be Etsy"
42:01;42:01;"But I've never bought"
42:01;42:03;"Etsy is pretty socialist I feel like"
42:03;42:05;"Is Etsy socialist?"
42:05;42:07;"Just people making stuff in their houses"
42:07;42:08;"And then other people buy them"
42:08;42:09;"It's like very peer-to-peer"
42:09;42:12;"Okay so one last question for you Connor"
42:12;42:16;"If if we buy what you're selling"
42:16;42:18;"And we decide we want to have a socialist Christmas"
42:18;42:19;"Sure"
42:19;42:22;"When we go home and we see our mothers and fathers"
42:22;42:23;"Aunts and uncles"
42:23;42:24;"Little cousins"
42:24;42:25;"Brothers and sisters"
42:25;42:28;"And we want to actually have a real discussion with them"
42:28;42:31;"About not only the horrible things that are happening in this country"
42:31;42:33;"But a path forward"
42:33;42:35;"Which I know you believe socialism is"
42:35;42:38;"What do you think is something that we can talk about with our family?"
42:38;42:42;"Like what's a question to have a socialist conversation on Christmas?"
42:42;42:43;"Where can we start?"
42:43;42:46;"I think a question to start would be about"
42:46;42:48;"Most of the things that Sanders talked about"
42:48;42:50;"Like you can say to your family"
42:50;42:51;"We're having a great time"
42:51;42:52;"We have the day off"
42:52;42:55;"Or having you know this wonderful moment"
42:55;42:56;"Where we're getting to see each other"
42:56;43:00;"But don't we believe that everyone should have a right to that?"
43:00;43:02;"Like why should that just be us?"
43:02;43:04;"Shouldn't everybody be able to enjoy?"
43:04;43:05;"And what if my uncle says"
43:05;43:07;"Well I worked really hard all year"
43:07;43:08;"I had to put in extra hours"
43:08;43:11;"And I got enough money that I could take this time off"
43:11;43:14;"If somebody else was lazy or didn't work hard enough to get a good job"
43:14;43:15;"And they got to work on Christmas"
43:15;43:16;"That's on them"
43:16;43:18;"I would say take a look outside his window"
43:18;43:19;"And especially in New York"
43:19;43:21;"You're going to see a lot of people"
43:21;43:24;"Busting their asses 60-70 hours a week"
43:24;43:26;"For very little money"
43:26;43:28;"That would be a really hard thing"
43:28;43:31;"To be able to spend the money to fly across the country"
43:31;43:34;"And take off several days let alone weeks"
43:34;43:36;"See their family with that kind of salary"
43:36;43:40;"And they're working just as hard as some rich guy sitting in an office"
43:40;43:41;"They're working harder"
43:41;43:42;"So that's what I would say to him"
43:42;43:43;"Fair enough"
43:43;43:44;"I will say that to my uncle"
43:44;43:45;"Well Connor thank you very much"
43:45;43:49;"Connor Kilpatrick of Jacobin Magazine"
43:49;43:51;"Thank you and have a very Merry Socialist Christmas"
43:51;43:52;"Merry Christmas to you"
43:52;43:54;"Peace"
43:54;43:59;"And what have you done"
43:59;44:04;"Another year over"
44:04;44:09;"And a new one just begun"
44:09;44:14;"And so this is Christmas"
44:14;44:18;"I hope you had fun"
44:18;44:24;"The near and the dear ones"
44:25;44:28;"The old and the young"
44:28;44:33;"A merry Merry Christmas"
44:33;44:37;"And a happy New Year"

44:47;44:52;"So this is Christmas"
44:53;44:57;"For the weak and for the strong"

45:07;45:11;"And so happy Christmas"
45:11;45:15;"For black and for white"
45:15;45:21;"For yellow and red ones"
45:22;45:24;"For blue and red ones"
45:24;45:28;"Let's stop all the lies"
45:28;45:32;"A merry Merry Christmas"
