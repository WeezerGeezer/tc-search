00:00;00:07;"Time Crisis, back again. It's a very busy February. We're going to be talking about"
00:07;00:11;"the Super Bowl, which was last week, and we'll be talking about the Grammys, which is today."
00:11;00:20;"We'll also be answering some fan emails, plus counting down the greatest hits of 2019 and"
00:20;00:29;"1959, the year the music died. Welcome to a very special Time Crisis with Ezra Kain."
00:29;00:34;"B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Sport One!"
00:35;00:41;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:41;00:48;"They were a threat, robbing me of my rightful chances"
00:48;00:55;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:55;01:02;"And so I dealt to the blow, when the bus had to go"
01:02;01:07;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:07;01:13;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:13;01:17;"He's the lonely man"
01:17;01:19;"Time Crisis back again."
01:19;01:20;"What's up, Jake?"
01:20;01:21;"Hey."
01:21;01:22;"Happy birthday."
01:22;01:23;"Thank you."
01:23;01:25;"You recently turned..."
01:25;01:26;"42."
01:26;01:28;"42. That's a big year."
01:28;01:30;"Firmly middle-aged."
01:30;01:32;"Enjoyed your birthday party last week?"
01:32;01:34;"Yeah, it was fun. Low-key."
01:34;01:36;"Group dinner at Columbo's."
01:36;01:37;"Old-school Italian restaurant."
01:37;01:39;"Yep. Live music."
01:39;01:41;"One cool thing is there's live music."
01:41;01:44;"That's like some real, just like, funky L.A. vibe."
01:44;01:47;"These places that have, like, they're usually in their 70s."
01:47;01:50;"Maybe late 60s, early 70s, have been playing forever."
01:50;01:52;"And this crew just knows every song."
01:52;01:53;"Yep."
01:53;01:56;"They were playing, like, ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and kind of jazz standards,"
01:56;02:00;"and at a certain point they called out for requests,"
02:00;02:02;"and everybody at the table said, ""You know any Eagles?"""
02:02;02:04;"'Cause it's Jake's birthday and Jake's a massive Eagles fan."
02:04;02:06;"That was actually really touching that, like,"
02:06;02:10;"multiple people at the table instantaneously thought of requesting Eagles songs."
02:10;02:11;"That's right."
02:11;02:15;"And this is like a little loungy jazz combo."
02:15;02:18;"Upright bass, drums, and piano/keyboards."
02:18;02:19;"Just three."
02:19;02:22;"At that point, mostly the keyboardists had been singing,"
02:22;02:25;"and the drummer then makes a joke."
02:25;02:27;"I guess somebody said, ""Do you guys know 'Desperado'?"""
02:27;02:28;"This must be, like, an old joke of his."
02:28;02:34;"He went, ""Avocado, why do you think you're so holy?"
02:34;02:37;"You're just guacamole."""
02:37;02:40;"I was like, ""Where does that come from?"""
02:40;02:45;"But then they went into a pretty solid rendition of ""Hotel California,"""
02:45;02:47;"and the drummer sang, which is very--"
02:47;02:49;"Maybe you just, like, listen to the Eagles tune."
02:49;02:51;"Don sang it. I'm going to sing this one."
02:51;02:53;"He had the lyrics on lock, too."
02:53;02:54;"Oh, yeah."
02:54;02:56;"No reference sheet, no iPhone."
02:56;02:59;"He just had the entire song memorized."
02:59;03:02;"He was a great drummer. He was really nuanced."
03:02;03:03;"Yeah."
03:03;03:06;"He knew every little, like, detail in that song."
03:06;03:09;"And in a little room like that, the drums are really on display"
03:09;03:11;"because it's kind of quiet, so you hear every--"
03:11;03:15;"It's not like big, boomy drums in, like, an arena or something."
03:15;03:17;"[imitates drums]"
03:17;03:18;"Yeah."
03:18;03:20;"♪ On a dark desk highway ♪"
03:20;03:22;"It was a slightly abridged version."
03:22;03:24;"Yeah, they only did one chorus."
03:24;03:27;"Maybe they skipped a verse by accident, but I was into it."
03:27;03:28;"But it was pretty tight."
03:28;03:31;"They actually held down the solo section."
03:31;03:33;"The keyboardist on his kind of, like, weird synth sound--"
03:33;03:36;"[imitates keyboard]"
03:36;03:38;"Like, on a Casio sound."
03:38;03:40;"One funny thing about that song--"
03:40;03:42;"I was thinking about it later."
03:42;03:44;"I don't think guacamole is, like, a step down from avocado."
03:44;03:45;"No, I know."
03:45;03:46;"It's avocado plus."
03:46;03:48;"It doesn't really make sense."
03:48;03:49;"Right."
03:49;03:52;"Guacamole is one of the more rarified dips."
03:52;03:55;"And then obviously everybody knows that guacamole is made from avocados."
03:55;03:57;"I mean, yeah, guac is always the highlight."
03:57;03:59;"Now you got avocado toast."
03:59;04:00;"That's true."
04:00;04:03;"But for decades, the whole reason people got into avocados"
04:03;04:05;"was because they like guacamole."
04:05;04:06;"Yeah, it's true."
04:06;04:07;"Yeah, I mean, I could understand--"
04:07;04:10;"It's a fun rhyme, but it doesn't really bear under the scrutiny"
04:10;04:15;"of Ezra Koenig's logic that he demands from lyrics."
04:15;04:18;"I actually mentioned it to the drummer after dinner."
04:18;04:21;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""DESPERADO""]"
04:22;04:27;"Why don't you come to your senses?"
04:27;04:35;"You've been out riding fences for so long now."
04:35;04:43;"Oh, you're a hard one, but I know that you've got your reasons."
04:43;04:53;"These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow."
04:53;04:57;"Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy."
04:57;05:01;"She'll beat you if she's able."
05:01;05:09;"You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet."
05:09;05:13;"Now it seems to me some fine things"
05:13;05:17;"have been laid upon your day."
05:17;05:23;"But you only want the ones you can't get."
05:23;05:26;"Desperado."
05:26;05:30;"So anyway, Jake, you know this song?"
05:30;05:31;"Oh, hell yeah."
05:31;05:33;"It's a great song."
05:33;05:35;"(SINGING) There is freedom."
05:35;05:36;"Is this Tears for Fears?"
05:36;05:37;"No, Crowded House."
05:37;05:40;"[MUSIC - EZRA KOENIG, ""DESPERADO""]"
05:40;05:43;"There is freedom within."
05:43;05:46;"There is freedom without."
05:46;05:48;"Try to catch the deluge in a--"
05:48;05:50;"I would say one of the best songs of the '80s,"
05:50;05:51;"one of the best hit songs."
05:51;05:53;"I'm not going to fight you on that."
05:53;05:55;"(SINGING) There's a battle ahead."
05:55;05:58;"Many battles are lost."
05:58;06:00;"But you'll never see the end of the road"
06:00;06:04;"while you're traveling with me."
06:04;06:09;"Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over."
06:09;06:15;"Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in,"
06:15;06:19;"let it come, let it come."
06:19;06:22;"You can do the war between us."
06:22;06:24;"You know that they won't win."
06:24;06:29;"So the song's called ""Don't Dream It's Over."""
06:29;06:32;"And I swore forever until very recently"
06:32;06:36;"I always thought that the meaning of the song,"
06:36;06:38;"especially because it's such a sad song,"
06:38;06:41;"it's a melancholic song, I always thought the way"
06:41;06:43;"you were supposed to interpret it was basically,"
06:43;06:46;"don't dream, period, it's over."
06:46;06:47;"Like idealism is over?"
06:47;06:49;"Like in a John Lennon sort of way?"
06:49;06:52;"(SINGING) Don't dream it's over."
06:52;06:53;"No?"
06:53;06:54;"Well, yeah, I realized that I was wrong."
06:54;06:55;"I found out I was wrong."
06:55;06:57;"But yeah, because it's a weird way to say it."
06:57;06:59;"But he's saying, don't dream that it's over."
06:59;07:00;"Wow."
07:00;07:03;"OK, so this is about a personal relationship, this song."
07:03;07:08;"But the lyrics are so grandiose and broad."
07:08;07:10;"Yeah, no, he's talking about society and stuff."
07:10;07:12;"(SINGING) There is freedom within."
07:12;07:15;"And then the next, (SINGING) in the paper today,"
07:15;07:18;"tales of war and of waste, but you turn right over"
07:18;07:20;"to the TV page."
07:20;07:21;"When is this song from?"
07:21;07:22;"1986?"
07:22;07:24;"I figured it was kind of mid '80s, and it was like--"
07:24;07:26;"Like Thatcher, Reagan."
07:26;07:30;"Yeah, and it's like brutal, just like cable television."
07:30;07:34;"It's like weird Repo Man vibes, just like the fabric of society"
07:34;07:36;"being ripped apart, global capital."
07:36;07:39;"Yeah, because some of the verse lyrics are kind of sad."
07:39;07:42;"So I thought he was saying, like, guys, it's 1986."
07:42;07:43;"Like, here we are."
07:43;07:44;"Wake up."
07:45;07:46;"The dream is over, essentially."
07:46;07:49;"But yeah, I guess he's saying that the world is really harsh,"
07:49;07:51;"but you'll never see the end of the road"
07:51;07:52;"when you're traveling with me."
07:52;07:54;"So don't dream that it's over."
07:54;07:56;"Like, he's saying we have a future."
07:56;07:59;"It's a plaintive song to a romantic partner."
07:59;08:01;"I guess so."
08:01;08:03;"Well, then there's this whole vibe, don't let them win."
08:03;08:05;"(SINGING) --in the room."
08:05;08:09;"My possessions are causing my suspicion, but there's no proof."
08:09;08:11;"My possessions are causing me suspicion."
08:11;08:15;"There's maybe, like, an anti-consumerist message."
08:15;08:20;"(SINGING) In the paper today, tales of war and of waste,"
08:20;08:26;"but you turn right over to the TV play."
08:26;08:31;"Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over."
08:31;08:37;"Hey now, hey now, when the world goes to sleep,"
08:37;08:44;"they come, they come to build a wall between us."
08:44;08:46;"We know they won't win."
08:46;08:48;"They come to the war between us?"
08:48;08:50;"No, they come to build a wall between us."
08:50;08:52;"To build a wall between--"
08:52;08:55;"Maybe it's like that classic convention, which I love, too."
08:55;08:57;"There's, like, a poem we had to read in high school,"
08:57;09:00;"a John Donne poem, you know, like an old English poet."
09:00;09:01;"Yeah."
09:01;09:03;"The whole thing is about being in bed and basically saying,"
09:03;09:06;"like, oh, leave us alone, son."
09:06;09:08;"Like, don't let the sun come in."
09:08;09:11;"Don't let the world come mess up our little vibe that we have here."
09:11;09:12;"So maybe it's that."
09:12;09:15;"Maybe he's saying it's 1986, the modern world sucks,"
09:15;09:18;"but I've got your back, we're together,"
09:18;09:21;"and I know that when the world comes in,"
09:21;09:24;"cable TV, Thatcher, whatever, Reagan,"
09:24;09:26;"it seems like it's all over."
09:26;09:27;"See, that's the thing."
09:27;09:29;"That's what always confused me, is he's saying to you,"
09:29;09:30;"don't dream that it's over."
09:30;09:32;"It's great songwriting, but I just always thought,"
09:32;09:34;"don't dream, period, it's over."
09:34;09:35;"So cynical."
09:35;09:37;"You know, I'd be, like, 14 and just, like,"
09:37;09:40;"it would come up, like, VH1's best songs of the '80s,"
09:40;09:42;"and this one would always jump out at me because I'm like,"
09:42;09:47;"that's amazing that there was just, like, this brutally pessimistic."
09:47;09:48;"Yet gorgeous song."
09:48;09:51;"Because especially you think of the '80s as being kind of like,"
09:51;09:53;"I mean, obviously there's, like, indie stuff,"
09:53;09:57;"but you think of it as being very 1986 pop, happy, fun, whatever."
09:57;09:58;"Sure."
09:58;10:01;"So I was always just like, damn, don't dream, it's over."
10:01;10:03;"Like, it doesn't get more harsh than that."
10:03;10:05;"I wonder if he's referencing Lennon there."
10:05;10:06;"Yeah, what does Lennon say?"
10:06;10:08;"Does he say the dream is over?"
10:08;10:10;"Yeah, the last song on the plastic Ono band."
10:10;10:13;"I don't believe in Beatles."
10:13;10:15;"The dream is over."
10:15;10:16;"Maybe."
10:16;10:20;"I wonder what Neil Finn thinks now, playing that song in 2019."
10:20;10:22;"Maybe now he wants to stay at the period."
10:22;10:24;"He's just like, wow, I nailed it back then."
10:24;10:27;"Don't dream, it's over."
10:27;10:31;"I wonder what Morrissey thought of that song in '86 when it came out."
10:31;10:33;"Yeah, or even just, like, Smith's fans."
10:33;10:34;"Right."
10:34;10:35;"Because--"
10:35;10:36;"It's not that far from it."
10:36;10:39;"No, I mean, Morrissey should have been thrilled if he wrote that song."
10:39;10:40;"Yeah."
10:40;10:42;"Well, I guess the Smiths were commercially--"
10:42;10:44;"I think in the US they were slightly more of a cult--"
10:44;10:45;"a very successful cult band."
10:45;10:47;"UK, very commercially successful."
10:47;10:48;"Top 10 hits."
10:48;10:54;"But yeah, maybe in the US he's like, man, I've been giving you guys gold for eight years."
10:54;10:56;"Or actually, man, I don't know, a few years."
10:56;10:57;"Yeah, yeah."
10:57;10:59;"And these guys just, like, come in with a top five hit."
10:59;11:01;"We've never even been in the top 40 in the US."
11:01;11:02;"Right."
11:02;11:03;"He might have felt like that."
11:03;11:05;"I was just having conversations about somebody."
11:05;11:11;"There's kind of like these cult types of music, whether it's, like, '80s indie or '90s alternative"
11:11;11:12;"or whatever."
11:12;11:17;"And there's the OGs who lay the groundwork are great songwriters, but they just don't"
11:17;11:18;"quite write hits."
11:18;11:19;"But who cares?"
11:19;11:22;"Because their body of work is as strong as any hit."
11:22;11:28;"And then you have these other people who can't quite produce the same body of work as the"
11:28;11:31;"OGs, but they can somehow synthesize it all into, like, one perfect song."
11:31;11:32;"Yeah."
11:32;11:33;"And in a way, I admire both of them."
11:33;11:37;"Then you have this third category of people who kind of can't do either and just kind"
11:37;11:38;"of, like, coast in between."
11:38;11:43;"And they're neither creating great bodies of work, nor are they synthesizing the elements"
11:43;11:44;"into one song."
11:44;11:48;"And they're just kind of, like, around that are just kind of riding the wave correctly"
11:48;11:49;"and just kind of..."
11:49;11:52;"Are you talking about this year's Super Bowl performer?"
11:52;11:55;"Oh, well, I've got a lot of issues with that."
11:55;11:59;"But one thing you've got to say about Maroon 5 is they write hit songs."
11:59;12:01;"They are technically hits."
12:01;12:02;"Right."
12:02;12:05;"They're not good songs, but they are technically hits."
12:05;12:06;"Yeah, I was thinking about that."
12:06;12:10;"Like, Maroon 5, I mean, they have a couple early songs that I like."
12:10;12:11;"""This Love."""
12:12;12:13;"That one."
12:13;12:14;"Yeah."
12:14;12:15;"And then..."
12:15;12:16;"That's my favorite one."
12:16;12:17;"They're like fake Stevie Wonder songs."
12:17;12:19;"""Sunday morning, na na na na."""
12:19;12:20;"Oh, yeah."
12:20;12:24;"Yeah, the later ones, I could get... wrap my head around a couple of them."
12:24;12:27;"You can wrap your head around it, but it's like, okay."
12:27;12:31;"I wonder if in, like, 20 years, I'll look back and be like, ""Oh, those are all great"
12:31;12:33;"songs,"" or if, like, the kids will be like..."
12:33;12:34;"I don't think so, man."
12:34;12:37;"I mean, a song, like, moves like Jagger."
12:37;12:40;"I wonder if I could ever wholeheartedly like that song."
12:40;12:42;"Other Maroon 5 songs, definitely."
12:42;12:46;"But the other song that I was thinking about that's kind of like a band that wasn't really"
12:46;12:53;"considered, like, a pillar of an era or a genre, but kind of made that one song that"
12:53;12:55;"takes all those elements and creates a hit is this one."
12:55;12:57;"This is kind of from your favorite era, Jake."
12:57;13:05;"""Hanging around downtown by myself and I had so much time to spend."""
13:05;13:06;"Not immediately recognizing it."
13:06;13:08;"I know the song, but I can't place it."
13:08;13:09;"Is it, like..."
13:09;13:10;"1997?"
13:10;13:14;"Yeah, there were a lot of bands like this that were, like, quickly riding the coattails"
13:14;13:15;"of good Indian alternative."
13:15;13:16;"""Pavement."""
13:16;13:17;"Look at this."
13:17;13:18;"This does kind of have a pavement vibe."
13:18;13:22;"""Disco superfly."
13:22;13:28;"I smell sex in candy hair."
13:28;13:32;"Who's that lounging in my chair?"""
13:32;13:34;"Is this Marcy Playground?"
13:34;13:35;"Oh, yes."
13:35;13:36;"Yeah, wouldn't you..."
13:36;13:39;"Who's the band that does ""Do you wanna die?"""
13:39;13:41;"Oh, is that like Toadies?"
13:41;13:42;"Yeah."
13:43;13:49;"""Yeah, mama, this surely is a dream."""
13:49;13:57;"By '97, I was out on the kind of commercial alt radio."
13:57;14:04;"""Hanging around downtown by myself and I've had too much time to spend."""
14:04;14:08;"The ultimate version of this is, ""Closing time."""
14:08;14:10;"Oh, yeah, that's even one step beyond."
14:10;14:16;"It's, like, truly all of, like, the interesting elements of the bands that preceded them"
14:16;14:18;"the previous ten years are sanded off."
14:18;14:20;"It's harder to do these days."
14:20;14:22;"I think now everything kind of coexists."
14:22;14:23;"Right, exactly."
14:23;14:24;"So it's not always--"
14:24;14:27;"""Finish your whiskey or beer."""
14:27;14:28;"Just, like, very literal."
14:28;14:33;"Yeah, I feel like in the '90s, things just happened slightly more slowly."
14:33;14:36;"So you could listen to--I guess this came out maybe right before--"
14:36;14:38;"""Blind date with a chance."""
14:38;14:42;"Like, you can totally hear how this song in another person's hands kind of becomes ""Sex and Candy."""
14:42;14:49;"""We went touch, touch, touch, touch, a redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash,"
14:49;14:54;"and this emery board is giving me a rash."""
14:54;14:57;"I think this is the second time that this song's been played on Time Crisis."
14:57;14:58;"I think you're right."
14:58;15:02;"""You're so beautiful to look at when you cry."
15:02;15:03;"Freeze."
15:03;15:06;"Don't move."
15:06;15:18;"You've been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life."""
15:18;15:21;"""Hanging around downtown."""
15:21;15:23;"But this has, like, more Nirvana in it, too."
15:23;15:24;"It has a little bit of both."
15:24;15:28;"Like, kind of like a baritone Kurt Cobain voice that he would do."
15:28;15:30;"Yeah, no, the verses."
15:30;15:32;"But I think the thing you've got to give up for this song--"
15:32;15:33;"Like Kenny Royalty?"
15:33;15:34;"Yeah, totally."
15:34;15:38;"But the way they go into the chorus--"
15:38;15:41;"Yeah, this part."
15:41;15:42;"Yeah."
15:42;15:44;"The drums drop out."
15:44;15:45;"It's just very well crafted."
15:45;15:46;"Yeah."
15:46;15:50;"""Who's that lounging?"""
15:50;15:53;"I thought maybe this was Everlast."
15:53;15:55;"What's that Everlast song?"
15:55;15:57;"Oh, no, that's very different."
15:57;15:58;"Is it?"
15:58;16:01;"Everlast is ""Maybe then you might know what it's like."""
16:01;16:03;"Not that far off."
16:03;16:06;"I think this just has, like, a slightly more indie vibe."
16:06;16:07;"Yeah."
16:07;16:11;"You know, I always like Pavement, but the only album I really know well is ""Slandered Enchanted."""
16:11;16:13;"Oh, the first one. Wow."
16:13;16:16;"Like, I never went deep on ""Wowie Zowie."""
16:16;16:18;"Actually, I know the last one pretty well, too."
16:18;16:20;"""Otero Twilight""?"
16:20;16:24;"Yeah."
16:24;16:26;"I mean, the beat on this one is--"
16:26;16:27;"This song's more hip-hop."
16:27;16:29;"Totally different, yeah."
16:29;16:33;"So, yeah, like, you think about Morrissey hearing ""Hey, Now,"" like, ""Don't Dream It's Over."""
16:33;16:40;"Did he, like, half want to give it up for it because it's just a well-written song, or it's part of him just like, ""Whatever, it's not as deep as a Smiths song."""
16:40;16:43;"Or you think, like, Stephen Malcomus hearing ""Sex and Candy."""
16:43;16:46;"I feel like he would have had something snarky to say about it."
16:46;16:47;"Oh, I guarantee it."
16:47;16:51;"Yeah, there's no way that Stephen Malcomus is in the late '90s and would be like, ""What do you think of Morrissey Playground?"""
16:51;16:59;"Just be like, ""You know, it's cool. I see a little bit of connection between our bands, but their song craft is kind of at a higher level than ours when you think about it."
16:59;17:03;"But, you know, I think I got other things going for me. There's room for both in this world."""
17:03;17:05;"I'm a much more lyrical guitar player."
17:05;17:06;"Yeah."
17:15;17:18;"Time Crisis on Beat One."
17:18;17:21;"I follow Malcomus on Twitter."
17:21;17:22;"Oh, yeah?"
17:22;17:24;"Caught his breakdown of the Super Bowl halftime."
17:24;17:25;"Oh, really? Was he going off?"
17:25;17:31;"Not really. The only thing I remember was him just saying, like, ""Didn't expect Maroon to go so RHCP on it."""
17:31;17:32;"[laughter]"
17:32;17:33;"That's fair."
17:33;17:35;"""Shirtless"" was a strong call."
17:35;17:40;"That the first, like, just a dude ripping his shirt off mid-Super Bowl set?"
17:40;17:47;"That was crazy, because it's like the most anodyne pop, just the most pathetic kind of drivel."
17:47;17:52;"But then he's just, like, fully sleeved out, tatted out, rips his shirt off."
17:52;17:53;"Obviously compensating for the..."
17:53;17:55;"These are the times that we live in."
17:55;17:59;"And, yeah, he definitely got clowned a little bit, but not to the extent..."
17:59;18:01;"He has to know he's going to get clowned, right? Come on."
18:01;18:06;"I wonder if there are any just, like, old rock fans who watch that."
18:06;18:07;"Oh, yeah."
18:07;18:10;"Actually, I'm sure there were. It's the Super Bowl."
18:10;18:15;"I can picture, like, an old rock fan, like an old dude watching the game and just being like, ""What's happening, man?"""
18:15;18:17;"""We had towns and adultery up there."""
18:17;18:21;"Yeah. It used to be super classic rock, but it's been a minute for that."
18:21;18:24;"Well, I mean, they cycled through all of those people."
18:24;18:25;"That's true. They all did it. Bruce."
18:25;18:26;"Yeah."
18:26;18:27;"So I could see that."
18:27;18:33;"Or is there a type of, like, older dude who's, like, so starved for just, like, a rock archetype dude?"
18:33;18:39;"Like a tatted out badass that he's, like, after the years of, like, Pop, Lady Gaga, and Bruno Mars,"
18:39;18:41;"there's just, like, some dudes who are like, ""Thank you."""
18:41;18:42;"Actually, probably not."
18:42;18:46;"Yeah, because, like, the classic rock dudes aren't, like, ripped and, like, tatted out."
18:46;18:47;"Yeah."
18:47;18:48;"It's, like, a crazy look."
18:48;18:49;"He's kind of a new archetype."
18:49;18:51;"I didn't even watch the whole halftime show."
18:51;18:52;"I halfheartedly, like, put it on."
18:52;18:53;"Yeah."
18:53;18:56;"I actually forgot that you're supposed to boycott the Super Bowl, so I, like, had half of that on."
18:56;18:59;"And then, like, about halfway through, you know what actually triggered it for me?"
18:59;19:04;"Is when they started doing that ""Girl Like You"" song, because we've talked about on Time Crisis how the lyric--"
19:04;19:05;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
19:05;19:09;"Even though I like a lot of things about that song, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is very catchy."
19:09;19:11;"That's when you've got to give it up for elements of the song craft."
19:11;19:14;"But there's something about the chorus when I just saw him going,"
19:14;19:18;"""Girls like you run around with guys like me to sundown."
19:18;19:21;"When I come through, I need a girl like you."""
19:21;19:24;"""Baby Shark"" is more meaningful than that chorus."
19:24;19:25;"I hate being negative."
19:25;19:27;"I really do like a lot of things about that song."
19:27;19:28;"But anyway, I was, like, listening to it."
19:28;19:30;"So I'm watching it, and I'm kind of like, ""What is this?"""
19:30;19:32;"And then that chorus came on."
19:32;19:34;"And Maroon 5 does have some good songs."
19:34;19:38;"I was just like, ""That's just the one that I'm just, like, this is so meaningless."""
19:38;19:42;"And then I started thinking about us talking about the song, and then I was like, ""Change the channel."""
19:42;19:44;"You want to go Pauzeecore on Adam Levine?"
19:44;19:45;"Because I'm ready."
19:45;19:49;"Bring up the YouTube of the Chris Cornell tribute."
19:49;19:51;"Oh, yeah, you were saying that in the group text."
19:51;19:54;"Yeah. I was watching this with Hannah a few weeks ago."
19:54;19:58;"There was, like, one day people were like, ""Oh, yeah, Miley Cyrus killed it at the Chris Cornell thing."""
19:58;19:59;"Was this on TV?"
19:59;20:01;"No, I think it's just YouTube."
20:01;20:03;"It was at the Forum, though, a huge venue."
20:03;20:04;"Kind of shocking."
20:04;20:10;"And then we kind of clicked over to the Adam Levine doing ""Seasons"" off the single soundtrack."
20:10;20:12;"And I was like, ""Damn, this actually sounds pretty good."""
20:12;20:14;"Bringing it up."
20:31;20:34;"I knew there would be a comment like this on the YouTube."
20:34;20:38;"""Not a fan of Levine in general, but damned if he didn't kick ass here."""
20:38;20:42;"That's kind of what I'm bringing to the table."
20:42;20:44;"Man, we haven't gone deep on YouTube comments in a while."
20:44;20:46;"This one is truly insane."
20:46;20:53;"""I've long insisted that only women should cover Cornell because they're the only ones who can reach the notes and show the passion."""
20:53;20:54;"I stand corrected."
20:54;20:59;"[Laughter]"
20:59;21:04;"I wonder if, like, in high school he covered this song with, like, an early version of Maroon 5, you know?"
21:04;21:05;"""Cars Flowers""?"
21:05;21:07;"Yeah. Oh, is that the name of the early version?"
21:07;21:11;"Yeah, all, like, the OG LA people I know are always like, ""Oh, yeah, I saw 'Cars Flowers' a few times."""
21:11;21:13;"Like, R.L.'s band, like, played with ""Cars Flowers."""
21:13;21:16;"I heard the rumor that they were kind of like a grunge band. Is that right?"
21:16;21:17;"I never heard them."
21:17;21:19;"""Did Adam Levine say 'Rock is dead'?"""
21:19;21:21;"Because one comment."
21:21;21:26;"""The guy who said 'Rock is dead' getting in on one of the biggest rock stars tribute show. Hilarious."""
21:26;21:32;"""Adam Levine is a great vocal talent. I've seen him do some pretty cool covers. Too bad he's a douchebag."""
21:32;21:33;"[Laughter]"
21:33;21:35;"No, he knows his shit, for sure."
21:35;21:38;"Could you see, like, a Jack White Super Bowl?"
21:38;21:39;"Is he just too esoteric?"
21:39;21:42;"I mean, obviously there's ""Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow."""
21:42;21:47;"I mean, yeah, I think the thing about Jack White is he's a very idiosyncratic guy."
21:47;21:48;"Yeah."
21:48;21:50;"Like, his last album had, like, some wild shit."
21:50;21:51;"Yeah, yeah."
21:51;21:53;"He truly marches to the beat of his own drummer."
21:53;21:59;"So, in some ways, White Stripes and Jack White are a very successful kind of cult left of center band."
21:59;22:03;"But that one song is one of the most famous songs of the past 20 years."
22:03;22:05;"Yeah, especially in sports arenas."
22:05;22:10;"You could even make the case that that's kind of like the last true global rock smash."
22:10;22:12;"Maybe Arctic Monkeys."
22:12;22:14;"""Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow."""
22:14;22:15;"Oh, yeah."
22:15;22:16;"But even that's a slightly different category."
22:16;22:19;"And, you know, I say this as a professional rock musician."
22:19;22:26;"I think we can admit that Seven Nation Army is the last true, like, universally important rock song."
22:26;22:32;"And I would make the case also as a professional rock musician, who cares whether your music is, like, truly universally important?"
22:32;22:33;"Of course."
22:33;22:39;"And maybe there's less consensus about anything now, but that's the last rock song that you could go anywhere in the world, you know?"
22:39;22:40;"Yeah."
22:40;22:42;"An isolated village in Bolivia."
22:42;22:44;"""Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow."""
22:44;22:45;"Norway."
22:45;22:46;"Sydney, Australia."
22:46;22:49;"You can go to all these places, and there would be somebody familiar with that,"
22:49;22:53;"the same way they'd be familiar with a Michael Jackson song or the Beatles or something."
22:53;22:54;"Yeah."
22:57;23:00;"I'm gonna fight 'em all"
23:00;23:04;"I said the Nation Army couldn't hold me back"
23:04;23:08;"They're gonna rip it off"
23:08;23:12;"Taking their time right behind my back"
23:12;23:15;"And I'm talking to myself at night"
23:15;23:20;"Because I can't forget"
23:20;23:23;"Back and forth through my mind"
23:23;23:28;"Behind a cigarette"
23:28;23:31;"And a message coming from my eyes"
23:31;23:33;"Just leave it alone"
23:52;23:56;"It'd be dope--I don't know why I thought of this--like an Oasis reunion."
23:56;23:57;"At the Super Bowl?"
23:57;23:58;"Yeah."
23:58;24:01;"The most British band ever."
24:01;24:02;"I don't know why I thought of that."
24:02;24:05;"How about Oasis sharing the stage with Blur,"
24:05;24:08;"bearing the hatchet for that classic Britpop beef,"
24:08;24:10;"America goes wild,"
24:10;24:12;"the Verve reunites."
24:12;24:13;"Oh, man."
24:13;24:18;"Ian McKay finally gets all the guys back together for the long-awaited Fugazi reunion."
24:18;24:19;"That would be tight. I mean--"
24:19;24:21;"Has Metallica played the Super Bowl?"
24:21;24:22;"Ooh, that's a good call."
24:22;24:24;"Have they? They would crush it."
24:24;24:25;"Yeah, that'd be sick."
24:25;24:26;"I mean, that's just like a no-brainer."
24:26;24:27;"They might have already done it, right?"
24:27;24:29;"I don't recall them doing it, but--"
24:29;24:30;"Sabbath?"
24:30;24:32;"Sabbath reunion?"
24:32;24:34;"No, Metallica hasn't done it."
24:34;24:36;"It'd be funny if they just went straight up like,"
24:36;24:40;"""Metalhead, Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica."""
24:40;24:44;"It would be kind of cool if, rather than focusing on individual stars,"
24:44;24:47;"people were like, ""Listen, this is America's most-watched event."
24:47;24:52;"Every halftime show should be a tribute to not just one superstar artist, but like--"
24:52;24:55;"I feel like this is what they would do in a smaller European country."
24:55;24:59;"Like, the Ministry of Culture says that every Super Bowl halftime show"
24:59;25:03;"has to be a tribute to a genre or movement in American music."
25:03;25:06;"So, yeah, it would be like, it can't just be Metallica."
25:06;25:08;"So next year, it's like speed metal."
25:08;25:09;"Yeah, it's like speed metal."
25:09;25:13;"And they'd have to bring out some forgotten smaller band that never made it."
25:13;25:14;"Right."
25:14;25:17;"American contributions to global culture."
25:17;25:18;"Wait, what's this?"
25:18;25:21;"Super Bowl 2001, the Kings of Rock and Pop."
25:21;25:22;"What does that mean?"
25:22;25:23;"All over the place."
25:23;25:26;"Aerosmith, NSYNC, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and Nelly."
25:26;25:27;"Wait, wait, that was--"
25:27;25:28;"That's a true grab bag."
25:28;25:30;"That's what they called the 2001 Super Bowl half show?"
25:30;25:32;"The Kings of Rock and Pop."
25:32;25:34;"The Kings of Rock and Pop?"
25:34;25:39;"Tapestry of Nations 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta."
25:39;25:44;"Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Tony Braxton,"
25:44;25:49;"an 80-person choir, and Edward James Olmos as a narrator."
25:49;25:50;"Whoa."
25:50;25:53;"Okay, so I guess back in the day, the Super Bowl used to be this kind of thematic theme,"
25:53;25:55;"even if they're kind of weak themes."
25:55;25:58;"How can I just let you walk away?"
25:58;26:02;"Just let you leave without a trace?"
26:02;26:09;"When I stand here taking every breath with you."
26:09;26:11;"Ooh."
26:11;26:16;"You're the only one who really knew me at all."
26:16;26:27;"How can you just walk away from me when all I can do is watch you leave?"
26:27;26:35;"'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain and we even shared the tears."
26:35;26:42;"You're the only one who really knew me at all."
26:42;26:47;"So take a look at me now."
26:47;26:51;"There's just an empty space."
26:51;26:59;"And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face."
26:59;27:04;"Oh, take a look at me now."
27:04;27:08;"There's just an empty space."
27:08;27:18;"And you coming back to me is against the odds, and that's what I've got to face."
27:18;27:23;"Well, anyway, the Super Bowl's in the past, although maybe we should briefly talk about some of the commercials."
27:23;27:24;"I didn't catch a lot of them live."
27:24;27:28;"Also, this year kind of seems like they let the cat out of the bag before the Super Bowl."
27:28;27:29;"Yeah."
27:29;27:31;"They put some commercials online."
27:31;27:34;"I mean, I saw the Lebowski one with Carrie Bradshaw,"
27:34;27:40;"and I thought that was maybe like the prelude into like a longer, more epic version that would air the day of the Super Bowl."
27:40;27:41;"Oh, but then they just aired it again."
27:41;27:42;"It's the same one."
27:42;27:45;"So for people who don't know, that was a major Super Bowl commercial."
27:45;27:52;"It was for Stella Artois, the Belgian beer company, and in it, Carrie Bradshaw walks into--or Sarah Jessica Parker."
27:52;27:54;"I thought she was playing the Carrie character, right?"
27:54;27:56;"I don't think--I think they called her Ms. Parker."
27:56;27:58;"Probably so that they wouldn't have to pay HBO."
27:58;27:59;"Oh."
27:59;28:06;"She walks into a restaurant, and everybody's ready to serve her Cosmopolitan because on the show Sex and the City, she was known to drink Cosmopolitans."
28:06;28:10;"And then everybody freaks out because she says, ""You know what? I want a Stella Artois."""
28:10;28:15;"And so it's going crazy, and then the kind of stinger of the commercial is that another iconic person walks in."
28:15;28:18;"This time, Jeff Bridges dressed as Jeff Lebowski."
28:18;28:20;"Was that this character's name? Jeff Lebowski?"
28:20;28:21;"Yeah."
28:21;28:24;"Also, I wonder again if they had to clear that or if he can just dress him up and--"
28:24;28:27;"There was a re-recorded version of The Man in Me."
28:27;28:29;"Did not use the Dylan version."
28:29;28:30;"Didn't even--Dylan wouldn't sign off."
28:30;28:38;"And then Jeff--or yeah, the dude comes in with like very clean and like styled hair."
28:38;28:39;"Very out of character."
28:39;28:43;"Goes to sit at the bar, and they say, ""A white Russian, Mr. Bridges?"" Probably."
28:43;28:44;"Right."
28:44;28:45;"And he said, ""Actually, I'll have a Stella Artois."""
28:45;28:47;"And then he and Sarah Jessica Parker have a moment."
28:47;28:55;"Although, you know, it's funny. Bob Dylan did approve--I don't know if he actually even owns it, but there was an actual Bob Dylan recording in a Super Bowl commercial."
28:55;28:58;"It was blown in the wind, and it was for Bud."
28:58;28:59;"This year?"
28:59;29:00;"Yeah, it was this year."
29:00;29:03;"It was because I guess Budweiser makes their beer out of wind now."
29:03;29:05;"That's very Anheuser-Busch."
29:05;29:13;"I think it was like vaguely tied into some water conservation effort that Jeff Bridges is involved in."
29:13;29:14;"Oh, Jeff Bridges?"
29:14;29:16;"Yeah, sorry, the Stella ad."
29:16;29:17;"Oh, okay."
29:17;29:22;"You know, just like at the end, and like tack on like some like hashtag and Jeff Bridges being like, ""Water conservation."""
29:22;29:23;"Yeah."
29:23;29:28;"""Well, listen, man, I'll do the commercial, but you know, we gotta give back."""
29:28;29:34;"Or no, there was a teaser like a few weeks before the Super Bowl, and there was just an image of Jeff Bridges wearing the dude sweater."
29:34;29:36;"And it said like, ""More to come like February 3rd."""
29:36;29:38;"And people were like, ""Oh, man."""
29:38;29:39;"Lebowski sequel."
29:39;29:41;"""Is there going to be a trailer?"""
29:41;29:45;"And then when I realized it was going to be a beer ad, I was actually kind of relieved."
29:45;29:46;"Right."
29:46;29:49;"Because I don't want there to be a sequel to Lebowski because there's just no way."
29:49;29:50;"Lightning can't strike twice."
29:50;29:51;"Exactly."
29:51;29:53;"I don't know if anybody could pull it off, though."
29:53;29:54;"Coen Brothers."
29:54;29:55;"Oh, for sure."
29:55;29:56;"I think so."
29:56;29:58;"Quick email from Aaron."
29:58;30:01;"Let's go to the time crisis mailbag."
30:01;30:02;"Hey, Crisis Crew."
30:02;30:04;"I've emailed in once before, so I'll save the intro."
30:04;30:06;"Suffice to say, I'm a big fan of the show."
30:06;30:11;"Anyways, the reason I'm writing in is because given the recent in-depth analysis of the Joker Man and Jamflow Man,"
30:11;30:15;"I was wondering what the most influential man was in music history."
30:15;30:17;"Some potential mans."
30:17;30:25;"Piano Man, Rocket Man, Macho Man, Nowhere Man, Rubber Band Man, Natural Woman, Secret Agent Man."
30:25;30:27;"Anyways, keep up the good work, Aaron in New York."
30:27;30:30;"I mean, Joker Man and Jamflow Man are still the top two."
30:30;30:31;"Man in me."
30:31;30:32;"There you go."
30:32;30:33;"I like Nowhere Man."
30:33;30:35;"Nowhere Man's an interesting concept."
30:35;30:39;"I think there's something about Joker Man and Jamflow Man that--"
30:39;30:42;"Well, the Jamflow Man's the best because he's the Jamflow Man."
30:42;30:44;"He's not a Jamflow Man."
30:44;30:46;"He's the Jamflow Man."
30:46;30:47;"Also, some music history today."
30:47;30:50;"For people who don't know, this was like a major event."
30:50;30:51;"It's a tragedy."
30:51;30:57;"Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and JP ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson were killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa,"
30:57;31:00;"along with pilot Roger Peterson, February 3, 1959."
31:00;31:03;"18 years to the day before the day I was born."
31:03;31:04;"See, that's crazy."
31:04;31:07;"Every birthday, I'm like, ""Oh, yep, February 3."""
31:07;31:13;"The event later became known as the day the music died after Don McLean referred to it as such in his song ""American Pie."""
31:13;31:14;"So it's crazy."
31:14;31:16;"Just three of the biggest stars touring together."
31:16;31:17;"Rock was young."
31:18;31:22;"Just imagine that, like three--I don't even want to throw out names."
31:22;31:23;"Yeah."
31:23;31:24;"But just imagine that."
31:24;31:25;"It's wild."
31:25;31:26;"Yeah, it's wild."
31:26;31:28;"So that was this big traumatic event."
31:28;31:33;"And the crazy thing also is to imagine that you were born 18 years after 1959."
31:33;31:34;"I know."
31:34;31:35;"Isn't that weird?"
31:35;31:36;"Does that trip you out?"
31:36;31:37;"Yeah."
31:37;31:42;"And then, like, punk rock started--or sort of is like--that's the year that it's, like, in the history books is starting."
31:42;31:43;"'77."
31:43;31:44;"Yeah."
31:44;31:46;"Only 18 years after that."
31:46;31:47;"Yeah."
31:47;31:48;"It's real weird."
31:48;31:52;"Every birthday I'm like, ""Wow, '59, only 18 years prior."""
31:52;31:53;"Right."
31:53;31:59;"There was somebody who was born on the day the music died, and they were like a college freshman when you were born."
31:59;32:00;"Yeah."
32:00;32:01;"Wow."
32:01;32:02;"Throw in that Buddy Holly song ""Heartbeat."""
32:02;32:07;"I was listening to some Buddy the other day, and I kind of thought of ""Vampire Weekend"" a little bit."
32:07;32:08;"Oh, really?"
32:08;32:09;"Do you know that one?"
32:09;32:10;"I love Buddy Holly."
32:10;32:11;"""Heartbeat."""
32:11;32:12;"I know a lot of the classics if you knew Peggy Sue."
32:12;32:13;"Sure."
32:13;32:14;"And ""Every Day It's Getting Closer."""
32:19;32:20;"Like early vampire."
32:20;32:21;"Oh, totally."
32:28;32:29;"And, like, the muted."
32:29;32:30;"Yeah."
32:56;32:58;"Yeah, I was reading a little bit about Buddy today, actually."
32:58;33:01;"Kind of a punk, because he recorded in Nashville."
33:01;33:03;"He didn't like how pro it was."
33:03;33:04;"Yeah."
33:04;33:10;"And then went to this studio in New Mexico, in Clovis, New Mexico, which is just over the border from Texas."
33:10;33:11;"And he's from Texas."
33:11;33:12;"He's from Lubbock."
33:12;33:17;"And then that's where he made all these definitive recordings at this little studio in New Mexico."
33:17;33:19;"He knew that his sound was more raw and minimalist."
33:19;33:20;"Yeah."
33:20;33:21;"Buddy Holly rules."
33:21;33:23;"All these songs are two minutes."
33:34;33:36;"He's got so many good songs."
33:46;33:47;"Yeah, it's really a bummer."
33:47;33:50;"It's amazing to think about, like, if he had kept making music through the '60s."
33:50;33:58;"And, like, his weird, like, weird and out of touch, like, psychedelic records he would have been making in, like, '68."
33:58;34:05;"Or he would have gone, like, straight Brian Wilson on it and made, like, some genius, like, highly orchestrated psychedelic records."
34:05;34:09;"Or he might have, like, gone Christian, like, all just, like, Christian country from 1968 on."
34:09;34:10;"Right, right."
34:21;34:23;"Yeah, like, this stuff, the production's crazy on it."
34:23;34:24;"Even just the beginning."
34:27;34:29;"That hard cutoff of the reverb that he did in it."
34:29;34:30;"Yeah."
34:47;34:56;"I always found that when you actually go back and listen to this stuff, even though I love it, it makes a lot of, like, cool first wave punk seem so unoriginal."
34:56;34:57;"Yeah."
34:57;35:03;"And then, like, the idea to, like, strip everything away, no orchestra, no horns, just a few elements, and dun, dun, dun."
35:03;35:06;"I guess, yeah, it's just not quite downstrokes yet."
35:06;35:09;"Yeah, and the guitar tone isn't, like, as thick."
35:09;35:10;"Yeah."
35:10;35:14;"But, yeah, it's like, oh, yeah, they went back to these records, like, 18 years earlier."
35:14;35:19;"Yeah, they just had a normal nostalgia cycle, and they're just like, oh, let's just do a slightly more modern version that was funnier lyrics."
35:19;35:20;"Yeah."
35:29;35:31;"This song's the hand claps?"
35:31;35:35;"Speaking of pavement, this was, you know, the first song on Crooked Rain."
35:35;35:37;"It's a very similar melody."
35:37;35:38;"Yeah?"
35:38;35:39;"You think they're referencing it?"
35:39;35:42;"I mean, I always thought they clearly were."
35:58;36:01;"The hits don't stop, man."
36:01;36:02;"Not Fade Away."
36:02;36:03;"Oh, nice."
36:03;36:04;"Grateful Dead's favorite."
36:04;36:05;"We've heard this one."
36:05;36:07;"Richard Pitcher's done Grateful Dead Not Fade Away."
36:07;36:08;"Oh, yeah."
36:08;36:11;"We've done Not Fade Away into Going Down the Road and Feeling Bad."
36:11;36:13;"Which is a classic combo."
36:27;36:28;"So many of those."
36:28;36:30;"Just bass drum and vocals."
36:30;36:31;"Yeah."
36:31;36:33;"It's funny to think about the Dead covering this."
36:33;36:40;"I wonder if it was seen as sort of like a hipster, ironic move for these, like, long hair, like, druggie hippies to be."
36:40;36:41;"Right."
36:41;36:44;"We're going to cover this square Buddy Holly character."
36:44;36:45;"Or was he always hip?"
36:45;36:47;"No, he must have always been kind of cool."
36:47;36:52;"Although, maybe the fact that they would play this song for, like, 15 minutes."
36:52;36:53;"Yeah."
36:53;36:55;"Maybe people were just like, ""That's hilarious."""
36:55;36:56;"I think so."
37:25;37:37;"Buddy Holly, not just a singer and a songwriter, a visionary producer."
37:37;37:40;"Just the drums, like, a little sloppy."
38:04;38:06;"That song's two minutes, 21 seconds."
38:06;38:07;"Longer for Buddy."
38:07;38:10;"I think we might have played Not Fade Away in Ojai."
38:10;38:11;"We've opened a few shows with it."
38:11;38:12;"It's a good opener."
38:12;38:14;"Just like, ""Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun."""
38:14;38:16;"How about one more email?"
38:16;38:19;"Let's go to the Time Crisis mailbag."
38:19;38:21;"This is from Cole."
38:21;38:26;"Confirm or deny Richard Pictures will be opening for Vampire Weekend on the upcoming tour."
38:26;38:27;"Thanks in advance."
38:27;38:30;"Yeah, by now, some of our tour dates are up."
38:30;38:32;"Yeah, I saw them on Instagram."
38:32;38:38;"We announced the tour about a week and a half ago, and now we finally announced the lineups."
38:38;38:40;"Everybody should go check out the tour dates."
38:40;38:42;"You will find some Richard Pictures."
38:42;38:47;"Not doing the whole tour, but Richard Pictures will be opening for Vampire Weekend."
38:47;38:48;"I'm amped."
38:48;38:49;"Gotta check it out."
38:49;38:50;"The band's amped."
38:50;38:51;"No, it's tight."
38:51;38:53;"I'm very excited about these tour dates."
38:53;38:54;"I mean, some of them are way in the future."
38:54;38:55;"It looks like a fun tour."
38:55;38:56;"A couple legs."
38:56;38:58;"Multiple legs."
38:58;39:00;"Different openers on each leg."
39:00;39:02;"Next Time Crisis."
39:02;39:05;"These shows are so far in the future, the next Time Crisis, I'll really go deep on it."
39:05;39:07;"When do the next singles drop?"
39:07;39:10;"That should be within a couple weeks."
39:10;39:11;"This month, Feb."
39:11;39:17;"Yeah, the idea is to do it about once a month, although I did notice a few little DMs and comments the past week where people were like,"
39:17;39:21;"""Hey, it's been a week since Harmony Hall 2021 came out."
39:21;39:22;"Where's the next drop?"""
39:22;39:24;"I was like, ""Did I say it was going to be every week?"""
39:24;39:26;"I did actually go double check, but no, I didn't."
39:26;39:28;"About once a month."
39:28;39:30;"I'm excited for the next drop."
39:30;39:31;"It's going to be fun."
39:31;39:34;"Then the next phase with all this stuff is to go perform it a bit."
39:34;39:37;"There's going to be some fun stuff announced pretty soon."
39:37;39:40;"But yeah, we got the big tour dates up."
39:40;39:41;"That's going to be exciting."
39:41;39:45;"Yes, you can see Richard Pictures with Vampire Weekend, but obviously not on the whole tour."
39:45;39:47;"It's hard to corral the whole Pictures gang."
39:47;39:52;"Yeah, people have jobs and families, and we're not a professional band per se."
39:52;39:53;"That's the way it should be."
39:53;39:54;"We're not."
39:54;39:55;"We're the cover band."
39:55;39:58;"We're not equipped to drop our lives and tour."
39:58;40:00;"Not yet."
40:00;40:03;"Maybe one day we'll get a full two weeks."
40:03;40:05;"Yeah, if we planned it, that'd be sick."
40:06;40:08;"We took a vow in summertime"
40:08;40:11;"Now we find ourselves in late December"
40:11;40:18;"I believe that New Year's Eve"
40:18;40:21;"Would be the perfect time for their great surrender"
40:21;40:24;"But they don't remember"
40:24;40:28;"Anger wants a voice"
40:28;40:30;"Voices want to sing"
40:30;40:32;"Singers harmonize"
40:32;40:35;"'Til they can't hear anything"
40:35;40:37;"Thought that I was free"
40:37;40:39;"From all that questioning"
40:39;40:42;"But every time a problem ends"
40:42;40:44;"Another one begins"
40:44;40:48;"And the stone walls of Amman are all bear witness"
40:48;40:51;"Anybody with a wounded mind"
40:51;40:53;"Can never forgive the sight"
40:53;40:57;"Of wicked snakes inside a place"
40:57;40:59;"You thought was dignified"
40:59;41:01;"I don't want to live like this"
41:01;41:03;"But I don't want to die"
41:03;41:08;"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
41:08;41:12;"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
41:12;41:17;"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
41:17;41:21;"I don't want to live like this"
41:21;41:23;"But I don't want to die"
41:23;41:26;"You're listening to"
41:26;41:28;"Time Crisis"
41:28;41:30;"On Beat One"
41:30;41:32;"Anyway, today's Grammy day."
41:32;41:35;"I'm pretty checked out on the Grammys."
41:35;41:37;"I'm deeply checked."
41:37;41:38;"Checked out?"
41:38;41:39;"No shocker there."
41:39;41:42;"What do you think the album with the most Grammy wins is, Jake?"
41:42;41:45;"This is a major comeback album for this artist."
41:45;41:46;"The Soft Bulletin."
41:46;41:47;"Yep, Flaming Lips."
41:47;41:48;"Yep."
41:48;41:49;"Album of the Year '90."
41:49;41:50;"Cleaned up."
41:50;41:51;"Santana Supernatural."
41:51;41:52;"Oh my God, that's the worst."
41:52;41:53;"Whoa!"
41:53;41:55;"That's Smooth Like the Ocean, right?"
41:55;41:56;"Yeah."
41:56;41:57;"God, brutal."
41:57;41:58;"You don't like that song?"
41:58;41:59;"Terrible."
41:59;42:01;"You were just the wrong age when that song came out."
42:01;42:02;"Everybody likes that song now."
42:02;42:03;"It's not good."
42:03;42:04;"Whoa!"
42:04;42:05;"Hey!"
42:05;42:06;"Hey, calm down."
42:06;42:12;"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
42:12;42:15;"Man, it's a hot one"
42:15;42:19;"Like seven inches from the midday sun"
42:19;42:23;"Well, I hear you whispering the words"
42:23;42:25;"And melt everyone"
42:25;42:28;"But you stay so cool"
42:29;42:31;"You like it a little better, 20 years later?"
42:31;42:32;"Nope."
42:32;42:33;"You like Santana?"
42:33;42:35;"Yeah, I like the '60s and '70s stuff."
42:35;42:36;"All right."
42:36;42:38;"Agree to disagree."
42:38;42:41;"For a reason"
42:41;42:45;"I'm stepping my own way"
42:45;42:50;"And if you said this life ain't good enough"
42:50;42:54;"I'd give my world to lift you up"
42:54;43:02;"I could change my life to better suit your mood"
43:02;43:07;"Because you're so smooth"
43:07;43:11;"Yeah, it's just like the ocean under the moon"
43:11;43:15;"It's the same as the emotion that I get from you"
43:15;43:20;"You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah"
43:20;43:22;"Give me your heart and make it real"
43:22;43:24;"Or else forget about it"
43:24;43:28;"I guess also this U2 album won nine Grammys."
43:28;43:30;"""How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb."""
43:30;43:31;"Which one is that?"
43:31;43:33;"It had this song called ""Vertigo"" on it."
43:33;43:35;"It came out in 2004."
43:35;43:38;"Weird."
43:38;43:42;"Uno, dos, tres, catorce"
43:42;43:44;"Catorce?"
43:44;43:45;"I remember that."
43:45;43:46;"Fourteen?"
43:46;43:48;"Uno, dos, tres, catorce."
43:49;43:52;"[guitar solo]"
43:52;43:56;"Lights go down"
43:56;44:00;"I feel like the last truly great U2 song was ""Beautiful Day."""
44:00;44:03;"In terms of like the hits that really hit."
44:03;44:06;"I thought your eyes are wide and though your soul"
44:06;44:09;"It can't be bought, you might be wrong"
44:09;44:11;"Hello, hello"
44:11;44:12;"Remember this?"
44:12;44:13;"Yeah, I do."
44:13;44:15;"The vertigo"
44:15;44:17;"I'm not mad at it."
44:17;44:19;"I wish I didn't know"
44:19;44:22;"So true, give me something"
44:22;44:24;"I can see"
44:24;44:29;"You know what, I like that part."
44:29;44:31;"I always hear this song and I think I don't like it."
44:31;44:34;"'Cause I feel like I always hear this song and I hear the beginning"
44:34;44:36;"Hello, hello, I'm in a place called vertigo"
44:36;44:38;"And I'm just like, ah, this one's not for me."
44:38;44:41;"And then when he goes, I can see you"
44:41;44:43;"I'm like, okay, that is pretty good."
44:43;44:44;"The rocks."
44:44;44:47;"This album won nine Grammys, but over two years."
44:47;44:48;"I don't know how that works."
44:48;44:52;"I guess like single vertigo won in 2005"
44:52;44:54;"and the album won in 2006."
44:54;44:58;"Anyway, those are the most awarded albums in Grammy history."
44:58;45:00;"Hello, hello"
45:00;45:01;"Remember this?"
45:01;45:02;"Yeah, I do."
45:02;45:04;"The vertigo"
45:04;45:05;"I'm not mad at it."
45:05;45:07;"I wish I didn't know"
45:07;45:10;"So true, give me something"
45:10;45:12;"I can see"
45:12;45:17;"I can feel"
45:17;45:22;"So true, give me something"
45:22;45:28;"I can feel"
45:28;45:30;"I'm pretty into these Grammy facts, actually."
45:30;45:32;"Yeah, these Grammy facts are tight."
45:32;45:34;"Most Grammy nominations."
45:34;45:35;"Quincy."
45:35;45:36;"No shocker here, Quincy."
45:36;45:37;"80."
45:37;45:38;"That's insane."
45:38;45:39;"Amazing."
45:39;45:41;"Paul McCartney, not far behind."
45:41;45:43;"78."
45:43;45:45;"Wow, Jay-Z, 77."
45:45;45:46;"Jesus."
45:46;45:49;"Wow, he's going to probably take the lead eventually."
45:49;45:50;"Yeah."
45:50;45:53;"Are those like albums that they're like involved in the production of?"
45:53;45:58;"I don't think Paul, like of Paul McCartney really producing other people's work."
45:58;45:59;"No, not too much."
45:59;46:02;"That's probably mostly for Beatles and then for solo stuff."
46:02;46:03;"Wild."
46:03;46:05;"Most Grammy nominations without winning."
46:05;46:07;"Morten Lindbergh, 26."
46:07;46:10;"Snoop Dogg has been nominated 17 times without winning."
46:10;46:12;"That's just crazy."
46:12;46:14;"Must be so burned out to roll up that many times."
46:14;46:15;"Yeah."
46:15;46:18;"Brian McKnight, also 17 nominations without winning."
46:18;46:20;"Bjork, 15."
46:20;46:22;"Joe Satriani, 15."
46:22;46:25;"That's a cool combo, Bjork and Joe Satriani."
46:25;46:27;"I wonder if they ever met."
46:27;46:29;"Most nominations in one night without winning."
46:29;46:30;"Nine."
46:30;46:32;"Paul McCartney, 1966."
46:32;46:33;"That's brutal."
46:33;46:37;"So he must have like maybe written, like the Beatles must have been nominated."
46:37;46:40;"Yeah, maybe he wrote for somebody else."
46:40;46:43;"Yeah, he wrote a few songs that were hits in the 60s too."
46:43;46:47;"Don't let the sun catch you crying."
46:47;46:48;"Paul wrote that?"
46:48;46:50;"I think so or I'm thinking of something else."
46:50;46:52;"He wrote..."
46:52;46:54;"I might be wrong on that one."
46:54;46:57;"He wrote some like early Badfinger songs because they were signed to Apple or something."
46:57;46:59;"If you want it."
46:59;47:00;"He definitely wrote that."
47:00;47:01;"Yeah."
47:01;47:03;"Oh, the Grammys."
47:03;47:05;"Remember I was going to go and do Grammy coverage."
47:05;47:06;"Wait, where was that?"
47:06;47:07;"Oh, yeah."
47:07;47:08;"Was that a joke we had?"
47:08;47:10;"Another forgotten time crisis idea."
47:10;47:14;"Well, we also talked about how you should be eligible to vote in the Grammys."
47:14;47:15;"Right."
47:15;47:16;"I keep forgetting to register."
47:16;47:19;"Also, I'll say it here, even though I'm embarrassed."
47:19;47:21;"I didn't get to vote in the Grammys this year."
47:21;47:24;"I knew what the final date to vote was, so I had it in my head."
47:24;47:25;"I was registering everything."
47:25;47:27;"I paid my stupid dues and all this."
47:27;47:28;"Yeah."
47:28;47:30;"And then, you know, just classic, like procrastinating."
47:30;47:32;"And then I realized, oh, today's the last day to vote."
47:32;47:34;"So I was like, I'm voting."
47:34;47:36;"Say it's like mid-afternoon on the last day to vote."
47:36;47:38;"I get to the website."
47:38;47:39;"They took this down early."
47:39;47:40;"What?"
47:40;47:41;"Yeah."
47:41;47:42;"Was it East Coast time?"
47:42;47:44;"Like you had to vote by 6 p.m. East Coast?"
47:44;47:48;"You would think that you should get the whole calendar day in the continental United States."
47:48;47:49;"That's BS."
47:49;47:50;"So I was like going through, looking around."
47:50;47:53;"I saw it like, no, they straight up took down the voting mechanism."
47:53;47:56;"I was on the right website, all that stuff."
47:56;47:58;"You know, so I was frustrated for a few minutes."
47:58;48:00;"And then, you know, I don't have the time."
48:00;48:02;"Then immediately forgot about it."
48:02;48:03;"Until now."
48:03;48:07;"But, you know, also it's like I know it was kind of my bad for waiting until the last day."
48:07;48:09;"But also, no, actually it's not my bad."
48:09;48:10;"It was the last day."
48:10;48:11;"I really double checked."
48:11;48:12;"I was like today's the last day."
48:12;48:13;"I saw the date."
48:13;48:15;"Maybe they had the results that they wanted."
48:15;48:16;"Yeah."
48:16;48:18;"And they were like, let's not roll the dice here."
48:18;48:19;"Let's pull this early."
48:19;48:23;"Can't let Ezra come in here just honoring the actually good music."
48:23;48:28;"So anyway, I just want everybody to know that if you don't like the results of the Grammys today,"
48:28;48:31;"in a sense, they're kind of void, you know."
48:31;48:34;"It's been a slight miscarriage of justice today."
48:34;48:36;"I hope everybody still has a good time."
48:36;48:40;"And, you know, everybody who does win, I don't want to take away from your special night."
48:40;48:42;"It still is an honor to win a Grammy."
48:42;48:44;"But there was a slight miscarriage of justice."
49:27;49:30;"Anyway, I'll still be tuning in to the Grammys."
49:30;49:31;"You know what?"
49:31;49:36;"Maybe if I go to a Grammys party tonight, I'll roll up on somebody from the Academy and say like, hey, listen."
49:36;49:41;"Rather than void the results this year, if I really went hard, they might have to void the results this year."
49:41;49:42;"Right?"
49:42;49:43;"Maybe you should, dude."
49:43;49:45;"I'd rather it turn into a positive thing."
49:45;49:47;"Seems like an awesome use of time."
49:47;49:48;"[laughs]"
49:48;49:49;"Just strip it."
49:49;49:51;"Wait, who's going to win the album of the year?"
49:51;49:53;"This just becomes a huge part of your narrative."
49:53;49:57;"Delaying Vampire Weekend's fourth album by yet another year."
49:57;50:00;"Hesitating litigation against--"
50:00;50:08;"Worked tirelessly to strip Bruno Mars of his 2019 Grammy."
50:08;50:10;"First line of your bit, dude."
50:10;50:11;"But again, I'm one voter."
50:11;50:12;"I guess that's what the Grammys are saying."
50:12;50:13;"Maybe it's like election, dude."
50:13;50:14;"It comes down to one vote."
50:14;50:16;"Maybe it actually did."
50:16;50:18;"But I would rather turn to a positive thing."
50:18;50:24;"So if I see anybody from the Recording Academy, and if it turns out that I'm not crazy and I actually was just like totally on the wrong date,"
50:24;50:27;"I'll say, listen, guys, you shut down the website a little bit early."
50:27;50:28;"Nobody likes that."
50:28;50:38;"You know, it's like when people, they're going to a store or a shop or a restaurant, and they say, I know this place closes at 7, get in there at 6.30, and it's closed."
50:38;50:39;"And then you see everybody in there."
50:39;50:43;"I mean, I get it with a restaurant a little bit more because it's kind of whacked."
50:43;50:47;"You can't roll up to a restaurant at 7 and be like at 6.59 and be like, enter the buzzer."
50:47;50:48;"I hate that."
50:48;50:49;"You can't do that."
50:49;50:50;"But--"
50:50;50:52;"I don't like going in during the last hour."
50:52;50:53;"You just let everybody go home."
50:53;50:55;"But that's a restaurant."
50:55;51:00;"I'm just saying, like, it's weird to like roll up to a store where theoretically you could get it done in 20 minutes."
51:00;51:01;"Yeah."
51:01;51:02;"And it's closed."
51:02;51:04;"And that can be kind of unpleasant."
51:04;51:10;"Or maybe we're all just too entitled, and if the store manager feels like [bleep] off a little early, let him."
51:10;51:15;"I guess deep in my heart that is what I believe, even if I've been momentarily annoyed about rolling into a shop."
51:15;51:18;"But anyway, I'll turn it into a positive thing."
51:18;51:19;"I'll say, you know what?"
51:19;51:25;"It would be so expensive and painful if you voided all of this year's results just because you screwed me with the voting."
51:25;51:26;"How about next year?"
51:26;51:28;"Free of charge."
51:28;51:30;"No, I don't want to hear about any $150."
51:30;51:31;"Free of charge."
51:31;51:33;"You get all my boys voting."
51:33;51:39;"I'm talking Seinfeld, Jake, all the Richard pictures."
51:39;51:40;"I'll say, you know what?"
51:40;51:41;"I won't make a fuss."
51:41;51:45;"You guys decided that you want to take the website down or whatever."
51:45;51:46;"You took the vote down early."
51:46;51:51;"Just next year, let me get 15, 20 of my boys, my people of all genders."
51:51;51:52;"Me plus 15."
51:53;51:54;"I just want to shake things up."
51:54;51:57;"They did that for the Oscars."
51:57;51:58;"You know, after the Oscars."
51:58;51:59;"Extended voting?"
51:59;52:01;"No, I don't know about how their website operates."
52:01;52:03;"For all I know, they took it down early too."
52:03;52:09;"But, you know, with Oscars, after the Oscars, so white, debacle, people are like, ""Well, what are we supposed to do?"""
52:09;52:10;"You know, people vote the way they vote."
52:10;52:12;"So, why don't we just get more people in the mix?"
52:12;52:15;"And they invited more, you know, they didn't invite just anybody."
52:15;52:22;"They invited younger actors, people in the film industry who maybe never would have had a chance before."
52:22;52:24;"Like my wife."
52:24;52:26;"Oh, she's now a voting member of the Academy?"
52:26;52:27;"Indeed."
52:27;52:28;"There you go."
52:28;52:29;"Yep."
52:29;52:32;"I think the music industry should shake things up a little bit too."
52:32;52:35;"And this could be a first step and say like, ""Yeah, you know what?"
52:35;52:37;"Actually, I want a plus 50."
52:37;52:38;"And you know what?"
52:38;52:43;"Everybody that I get to sign up for the Grammys, I think I should get $100 free Postmates too."""
52:43;52:44;"I like that."
52:44;52:50;"But I thought anyone could register to vote in the Grammys if you played on like a certain amount of records."
52:50;52:52;"That was the whole joke about me registering."
52:52;52:53;"Well, exactly."
52:53;52:57;"But I think that's a little bit onerous because there's a lot of people who are involved in the music industry."
52:57;53:00;"Like who cares if you played Cowbell on six records?"
53:00;53:02;"Well, don't slight my efforts."
53:02;53:03;"No, no, no. Sorry. I'm not dissing you."
53:03;53:06;"I'm including myself as somebody who just happened to be on a few records."
53:06;53:12;"But that's like a classic music industry scam that there would always be like some A&R guy at a label who would be like, ""Oh, yeah."
53:12;53:14;"He sang backup vocals."
53:14;53:15;"He was part of the choir."""
53:15;53:17;"You know, that literally was the thing."
53:17;53:23;"And sometimes it would be an outright lie and sometimes it wouldn't where they might actually be recording like, you know, hand claps on a record."
53:23;53:28;"And be like, ""Let's get the whole office down to the studio to record hand claps on the..."""
53:28;53:31;"So I'm saying invite people who are part of the music world."
53:31;53:35;"Like for instance, he's not here, but a Seinfeld 2000."
53:35;53:41;"A guy who every two weeks is crunching numbers on a show about music."
53:41;53:47;"There's no way that Seinfeld has been on six commercially recorded albums."
53:47;53:55;"But this is the type of person that could bring a slightly different perspective to the Grammys while still being part of the larger musical community."
53:55;53:56;"That's what I'm saying."
53:56;53:57;"I dig it."
53:57;54:00;"So anyway, what do we have to look forward to tonight?"
54:00;54:03;"Why don't we just run through the Record of the Year category real quick."
54:03;54:04;"All right. Let's do it."
54:04;54:07;"So Record of the Year, just so people understand, it's not Song of the Year."
54:07;54:09;"Song of the Year goes to the songwriters."
54:09;54:12;"Record of the Year goes to the artist who made that song."
54:12;54:14;"So they're both about songs. You know what I mean?"
54:14;54:17;"So Record of the Year, we got ""I Like It"", Cardi B."
54:17;54:27;"I support this as Record of the Year."
54:27;54:33;"I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunning, I like shining."
54:33;54:35;"I like million dollar deals, where's my pen?"
54:35;54:36;"Bitch, I'm signing."
54:36;54:40;"I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks."
54:40;54:43;"I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch."
54:43;54:45;"I like Texas from my exes."
54:45;54:47;"So this is the one that goes to the performer."
54:47;54:51;"Yeah, so this is Cardi B, ""Bad Money"", J Balvin is on it."
54:51;54:52;"Okay."
54:52;55:17;"She also nominated Brandi Carlile, singer-songwriter, country artist."
55:17;55:20;"Wait, is she related to Belinda Carlile?"
55:20;55:22;"I think it's spelled slightly differently."
55:22;55:41;"A little bit of that tasteful palette of the 1970s."
55:41;55:43;"Have you heard this?"
55:43;55:46;"I checked out some of her records, somebody told me it was good."
55:46;55:49;"To keep 'em from running wild"
55:49;55:54;"They can kick dirt in your face"
55:54;55:58;"Dress you down and tell you that your place is in the middle"
55:58;56:01;"When they hate the way you shine"
56:01;56:08;"I see you tugging on your shirt"
56:08;56:11;"Trying to hide inside of it"
56:11;56:15;"And hide how much it hurts"
56:16;56:21;"Let 'em live while they can"
56:21;56:23;"It's cool, but it's real random."
56:23;56:26;"I guess everything's random, but like..."
56:26;56:29;"How do you even judge that versus the..."
56:29;56:32;"People would be so disappointed compared to these giant hits."
56:32;56:33;"Like fun."
56:33;56:35;"But it is a very good song."
56:35;56:44;"And the jokes on me"
56:44;56:47;"Man, you got ""This is America"" Childish Gambino."
56:47;56:48;"Oh yeah."
56:48;56:51;"This song is not that tight."
56:51;56:54;"Oh, video, tight."
56:54;56:56;"This part, tight."
56:56;56:58;"And then when the song kicks in, it's like, eh."
56:58;57:00;"I mean, it just doesn't go anywhere."
57:00;57:02;"It just starts like, ""This is America."""
57:02;57:03;"I mean, he says stuff."
57:04;57:06;"Party just for you"
57:06;57:08;"We just want the money"
57:08;57:10;"Money just for you"
57:10;57:12;"I know you want it, got it"
57:12;57:14;"Party just for me"
57:14;57:16;"Girl, you got me dancing"
57:16;57:18;"Dancing, shake your brain"
57:18;57:20;"We just want to party"
57:20;57:22;"Party just for you"
57:22;57:24;"We just want the money"
57:24;57:26;"Money just for you"
57:26;57:30;"I'm just noticing these hardpan vocals for the first time."
57:30;57:32;"Girl, you got me dancing"
57:32;57:34;"Dancing, shake your brain"
57:34;57:37;"This is America"
57:37;57:39;"Don't catch you slipping, though"
57:41;57:43;"Look what I'm whipping, though"
57:43;57:45;"This is America"
57:45;57:47;"Don't catch you slipping, though"
57:49;57:51;"Look what I'm whipping, though"
57:51;57:53;"This is America"
57:53;57:55;"Don't catch you slipping, though"
57:55;57:57;"Look how I'm living, though"
57:57;57:59;"Police be tripping, though"
57:59;58:01;"Yeah, this is America"
58:01;58:03;"Guns in my area"
58:03;58:05;"I got the strap"
58:05;58:07;"I gotta carry 'em"
58:07;58:09;"Yeah, yeah, I'ma go into this"
58:09;58:11;"Yeah, yeah, this is guerrilla"
58:11;58:13;"Yeah, yeah, I'ma go get the bag"
58:13;58:15;"Yeah, yeah, or I'ma get the pad"
58:15;58:17;"Yeah, yeah, I'm so cold like, yeah"
58:17;58:19;"Yeah, I'm so dull like, yeah"
58:19;58:21;"We gon' blow like, yeah"
58:21;58:23;"I wouldn't be mad if that won."
58:23;58:25;"Drake ""God's Plan""?"
58:25;58:27;"This feels way too old."
58:27;58:29;"That's the funny thing about the Grammys."
58:29;58:31;"Did this come out in 2017? No, this came out"
58:31;58:33;"in 2018, right?"
58:33;58:35;"I guess, yeah, but it feels like"
58:35;58:37;"the oldest of the batch."
58:37;58:39;"I'm almost out of trouble with me"
58:39;58:41;"Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me"
58:41;58:43;"Don't pull up at 6am, say I'm through"
58:43;58:45;"You know how I like it when you loving on me"
58:47;58:49;"I don't wanna die for them to make me"
58:49;58:51;"Isn't Drake's whole thing that he just doesn't win enough Grammys?"
58:51;58:53;"And he's always mad about it?"
58:53;58:55;"Is he? I don't know. Okay."
58:55;58:57;"I mean, it's just hilarious that all these songs are competing"
58:57;58:59;"in a category that makes no sense."
58:59;59:01;"God's Plan"
59:03;59:05;"I hold back sometimes I won't"
59:05;59:07;"I feel good sometimes I don't"
59:07;59:09;"I finesse down Western Road"
59:09;59:11;"Might go down to G.O.D"
59:11;59:13;"Might go hard on Southside G"
59:13;59:15;"I make sure that Northside eat"
59:15;59:17;"And still"
59:17;59:19;"Bad things"
59:19;59:21;"It's a lot of bad things"
59:21;59:23;"I'm not a bad person"
59:23;59:25;"I'm just a bad person"
59:27;59:29;"Bad things"
59:29;59:31;"It's a lot of bad things"
59:31;59:33;"That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin'"
59:33;59:35;"And wishin' and wishin' on me"
59:35;59:41;"Bad things"
59:41;59:43;"It's a lot of bad things"
59:43;59:45;"That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin'"
59:45;59:47;"And wishin' and wishin' on me"
59:47;59:49;"Yeah"
59:49;59:51;"Ay, ay"
59:51;59:55;"Okay. I'd be happy to see Bradley get a W"
59:55;59:57;"I'd be even snubbed as a director"
59:57;59:59;"at the Oscars"
59:59;01:00:07;"Tell me something good"
01:00:07;01:00:11;"It would be kind of tight"
01:00:11;01:00:13;"to see Bradley Cooper"
01:00:13;01:00:15;"clean up at the Grammys"
01:00:15;01:00:17;"Here's another thing"
01:00:17;01:00:19;"Strike out at the Oscars"
01:00:19;01:00:21;"If Shallow wins at the Oscars"
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Bradley will not win an Oscar"
01:00:23;01:00:25;"because they give it to the songwriters"
01:00:25;01:00:27;"Right"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"So Mark and all those people win Oscars but not Bradley"
01:00:29;01:00:31;"So this might be his only shot"
01:00:31;01:00:33;"to really be honored for Shallow"
01:00:33;01:00:35;"And I'm into that"
01:00:35;01:00:37;"What's the like gambling odds favorite"
01:00:37;01:00:39;"for best picture at the Oscars"
01:00:39;01:00:41;"Is it Stars Born?"
01:00:41;01:00:43;"Oof, I don't know"
01:00:43;01:00:45;"Or is it Roma?"
01:00:45;01:00:47;"It's gonna be a close one"
01:00:47;01:00:49;"Down to the wire"
01:00:49;01:00:51;"Another song of your contender, Post Malone, Rockstar"
01:00:51;01:00:53;"This one feels really old"
01:00:53;01:00:55;"This one feels like 2017 to me"
01:00:55;01:00:57;"It came out in 2017"
01:00:57;01:00:59;"but it's after the eligibility"
01:00:59;01:01:01;"What? Fiscal year"
01:01:01;01:01:07;"I'd be happy to see"
01:01:07;01:01:09;"Postie win"
01:01:09;01:01:11;"Also, I guess"
01:01:11;01:01:13;"21 Savage would win one"
01:01:13;01:01:15;"and he could deserve a win"
01:01:15;01:01:17;"He's being targeted by ICE"
01:01:17;01:01:19;"for his immigration status"
01:01:19;01:01:21;"That's not cool"
01:01:21;01:01:23;"Where's he from?"
01:01:23;01:01:25;"I guess he was born in England"
01:01:25;01:01:27;"I don't want to weigh in too much"
01:01:27;01:01:29;"about a lot of the details"
01:01:29;01:01:31;"but as I understand it"
01:01:31;01:01:33;"I guess very few people knew"
01:01:33;01:01:35;"that he was actually born in England"
01:01:35;01:01:37;"Who cares, his family immigrated"
01:01:37;01:01:39;"But then ICE went so far out of their way"
01:01:39;01:01:41;"to turn it into, as you would expect"
01:01:41;01:01:43;"to turn into this big thing"
01:01:43;01:01:45;"where they were like"
01:01:45;01:01:47;"his whole persona is an elaborately crafted lie"
01:01:47;01:01:49;"It's not a fake accent he's doing"
01:01:49;01:01:51;"and then people are running the numbers"
01:01:51;01:01:53;"on if he's been illegal"
01:01:53;01:01:55;"since when ICE said, when would he have moved to the US"
01:01:55;01:01:57;"He would have been like 12 or 13"
01:01:57;01:01:59;"I think you can move countries"
01:01:59;01:02:01;"when you're a tween"
01:02:01;01:02:03;"and lose your accent and become pretty at home"
01:02:03;01:02:05;"They're talking about him as if he moved"
01:02:05;01:02:07;"to the US when he was like 18"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"Yeah, and Ted Cruz was born in Canada"
01:02:09;01:02:11;"Mitt Romney was born in Mexico"
01:02:11;01:02:13;"Who cares?"
01:02:13;01:02:15;"It's one thing for a governmental organization"
01:02:15;01:02:17;"to be like, technically he's breaking the law"
01:02:17;01:02:19;"we have to deal with it somehow"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"but they literally put out a press release to say"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"this guy's fake"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"his whole life is a lie"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"and it's like, if he spent his formative years in Atlanta"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"he's from Atlanta"
01:02:29;01:02:31;"Yeah, I really hope it backfires"
01:02:31;01:02:33;"but it almost seems like ICE was trying to be like"
01:02:33;01:02:35;"appeal to"
01:02:35;01:02:37;"people who would normally oppose ICE"
01:02:37;01:02:39;"by being like, hey guys, I know we're the bad guys"
01:02:39;01:02:41;"we're ripping families apart"
01:02:41;01:02:43;"we're deporting people for no reason"
01:02:43;01:02:45;"but this time we also caught a rapper"
01:02:45;01:02:47;"being fake, so that's pretty cool"
01:02:47;01:02:49;"It almost seems like that's how they were trying to frame it"
01:02:49;01:02:51;"and I'm sad to say"
01:02:51;01:02:53;"some people bought it"
01:02:53;01:02:55;"because there are a lot of memes"
01:02:55;01:02:57;"people being very light-hearted about it"
01:02:57;01:02:59;"and it's like, come on"
01:02:59;01:03:01;"we don't joke about ICE"
01:03:01;01:03:03;"Anyway, I'm sure there's more information to come"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"Here's another contender"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"this one also feels so old"
01:03:07;01:03:09;"to me, another contender for"
01:03:09;01:03:11;"record of the year"
01:03:13;01:03:17;"Oh my god, this song"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"So there's seven nominees"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"that's such a random number"
01:03:23;01:03:35;"Zedd,"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"Maren Morris, and Gray"
01:03:41;01:03:43;"I mean, this part's"
01:03:43;01:03:45;"great"
01:03:55;01:03:57;"Interesting to see this list of best"
01:03:57;01:03:59;"new artist nominees"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"We're getting Greta Van Fleet up in there"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"Okay"
01:04:03;01:04:05;"I'm still rooting for Greta Van Fleet"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"Best new artist"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"[laughter]"
01:04:09;01:04:11;"Mimicry of Zeppelin"
01:04:11;01:04:13;"Subversive mimicry"
01:04:13;01:04:15;"Best new artist"
01:04:15;01:04:17;"Chloe X Haley, Chloe and Haley"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"Luke Combs, Greta Van Fleet, her"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Dua Lipa, Margot Price"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"Shout out Margot Price"
01:04:23;01:04:25;"I've seen her in concert, she's cool"
01:04:25;01:04:27;"Bebe Rexha, Georgia Smith"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"I've heard of three of those"
01:04:29;01:04:31;"I mean, look, you know I don't like all the hate"
01:04:31;01:04:33;"on Greta Van Fleet"
01:04:33;01:04:35;"I love their whimsical post-modern"
01:04:35;01:04:37;"sense of humor, but they cannot win"
01:04:37;01:04:39;"best new artist, that's a bad look"
01:04:39;01:04:41;"Bad look for the Grammys or for them?"
01:04:41;01:04:43;"Bad look for the Grammys"
01:04:43;01:04:45;"I get it, like, you know, some of us"
01:04:45;01:04:47;"Fun rock band"
01:04:47;01:04:49;"As opposed to Adam Levine, don't think rock is dead, man"
01:04:49;01:04:51;"But I think"
01:04:51;01:04:53;"Remember, rock's played out, dog"
01:04:53;01:04:55;"Have you actually told that story"
01:04:55;01:04:57;"on Time Crisis?"
01:04:57;01:04:59;"I think so, early TC"
01:04:59;01:05:01;"It's worth reminding people"
01:05:01;01:05:03;"Well, it was like when I was working at an art gallery"
01:05:03;01:05:05;"in relation work, and we were just like"
01:05:05;01:05:07;"on lunch break and we were all like crushing"
01:05:07;01:05:09;"burritos from Chipotle"
01:05:09;01:05:11;"I don't know what we were"
01:05:11;01:05:13;"we were talking about music, talking about rock"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"Shooting the sh*t"
01:05:15;01:05:17;"And this dude that I work with"
01:05:17;01:05:19;"a couple years older than me"
01:05:19;01:05:21;"just wearing like a white tank top"
01:05:21;01:05:23;"Just a 47 year old"
01:05:23;01:05:25;"Yeah, just a 47 year old dude just like crushing the burritos"
01:05:25;01:05:27;"just like, ""Rock's played out, dog!"""
01:05:27;01:05:29;"Just totally serious"
01:05:29;01:05:31;"Yeah, oh yeah"
01:05:31;01:05:33;"Just kind of shut it down"
01:05:33;01:05:35;"I can picture that you were just kind of like, ""You know, man"
01:05:35;01:05:37;"I keep up with some of the new stuff"
01:05:37;01:05:39;"Like, you know, I like that"
01:05:39;01:05:41;"I like the war on drugs"
01:05:41;01:05:43;"I like the war on drugs, man, and you know, don't count out"
01:05:43;01:05:45;"Bob Pollard, he's still making some cool"
01:05:45;01:05:47;"Rock's played out, dog!"""
01:05:47;01:05:53;"I would respect Adam Levine"
01:05:53;01:05:57;"That could be a TC shirt"
01:05:57;01:05:59;"Oh yeah, we should make that ""Rock's played out, dog"""
01:05:59;01:06:01;"""8 minute kip kod"" on the back"
01:06:01;01:06:03;"""Rock's played out, dog"""
01:06:03;01:06:05;"I don't like when people say ""Rock is dead"""
01:06:05;01:06:07;"It's just so serious"
01:06:07;01:06:09;"You're just like, none of this is all music"
01:06:09;01:06:11;"God is dead"
01:06:11;01:06:13;"Rock is dead"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"It's just so overly dramatic"
01:06:15;01:06:17;"to talk about a genre of music being dead"
01:06:17;01:06:21;"Especially when people say something like that"
01:06:21;01:06:23;"They're often being dramatic"
01:06:23;01:06:25;"because they want to prove that they know what's up"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"It also seems like some weird"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"kind of like capitalist vibe"
01:06:29;01:06:31;"just to be like, ""Glass bottles?"
01:06:31;01:06:33;"Are you kidding? Glass bottles are over"
01:06:33;01:06:35;"They're dead. Welcome to the plastic era."""
01:06:35;01:06:37;"It's like, yo, okay"
01:06:37;01:06:39;"We get it, you got some new"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"that you want to peddle, whatever"
01:06:41;01:06:43;"There's always going to be people liking the old stuff, man"
01:06:43;01:06:45;"It's cool, but I gotta say"
01:06:45;01:06:47;"You like what you like"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"But ""Rock is dead"" is such an overly dramatic phrase"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"that when anybody says something"
01:06:51;01:06:53;"like that something's dead, you almost know that it's not quite dead"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"Just like kind of cornballs are saying that"
01:06:55;01:06:57;"But ""Rock's played out, dog"""
01:06:57;01:06:59;"I respect anybody who says that"
01:06:59;01:07:01;"I'm not saying it's dead"
01:07:01;01:07:03;"I'm just saying ""Rock's played out, dog"""
01:07:03;01:07:05;"Rock's played out, dog"
01:07:07;01:07:15;"Why are you separating"
01:07:15;01:07:17;"All of your children"
01:07:17;01:07:19;"All of your biggest fans"
01:07:19;01:07:21;"I saw your picture"
01:07:21;01:07:23;"And I took that"
01:07:23;01:07:25;"Got the finest in the land"
01:07:25;01:07:27;"Cameras in action"
01:07:27;01:07:29;"Yeah"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"The words you know so well"
01:07:33;01:07:35;"You're in and out of fashion"
01:07:35;01:07:39;"You know how it would have felt"
01:07:39;01:07:45;"On the curtain walls"
01:07:45;01:07:51;"On the high walls"
01:07:51;01:07:53;"Baby"
01:07:53;01:07:55;"What's a belly doll"
01:07:55;01:08:01;"Now you're not at all"
01:08:01;01:08:03;"Now you're not at all"
01:08:03;01:08:05;"Now"
01:08:06;01:08:08;"I will say that rock music's been humbled"
01:08:08;01:08:10;"And perhaps rock music was arrogant"
01:08:10;01:08:12;"In decades past"
01:08:12;01:08:14;"It's had a long run"
01:08:16;01:08:18;"We're like 60-something years in"
01:08:18;01:08:20;"Oh yeah, it's deep"
01:08:20;01:08:22;"Buddy Holly died 60 years ago"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"And arguably rock music died 60 years ago"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"That's true"
01:08:26;01:08:28;"We've just been living in the shadow of Buddy since then, man"
01:08:28;01:08:30;"But I don't believe rock is dead"
01:08:30;01:08:32;"We are in a fallow period"
01:08:32;01:08:34;"Perhaps we're in a fallow period"
01:08:34;01:08:36;"But I also think there's gotta be some humility"
01:08:36;01:08:38;"I think it's a good thing"
01:08:38;01:08:40;"You know, when a genre is thought to be dead"
01:08:40;01:08:42;"Or at least played out, dawg"
01:08:42;01:08:44;"There's nothing wrong with being in the played out, dawg period"
01:08:44;01:08:46;"It kinda lets you shake off"
01:08:46;01:08:48;"I guess I'm talking as an artist as well"
01:08:48;01:08:50;"It lets you shake off some of the pretensions"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Of the arrogant imperial era"
01:08:52;01:08:54;"But"
01:08:54;01:08:56;"We're definitely post-empire"
01:08:56;01:08:58;"But I also think that means"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"Approaching the music industry with humility"
01:09:00;01:09:02;"And I think"
01:09:02;01:09:04;"If Greta Van Fleet are who I believe they are"
01:09:04;01:09:06;"Who, like us"
01:09:06;01:09:08;"Are still listening to rock in 2019"
01:09:08;01:09:10;"And just enjoying"
01:09:10;01:09:12;"Some of that good old music"
01:09:12;01:09:14;"And trying to put their own spin on it, which I respect"
01:09:14;01:09:16;"And of course they get added points for their post-modern"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"Borgesian mimicry"
01:09:18;01:09:20;"But in the post-empire period"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"Rock needs to be humble"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"And rock should not be winning"
01:09:24;01:09:26;"Best new artist"
01:09:26;01:09:28;"Over some artists"
01:09:28;01:09:30;"Who are actually, you know"
01:09:30;01:09:32;"Whether you like them or not"
01:09:32;01:09:34;"Your BB Rex's, Dua Lipa's"
01:09:34;01:09:36;"They are fundamentally more"
01:09:36;01:09:38;"Modern, relevant, new figures"
01:09:38;01:09:40;"Of their time"
01:09:40;01:09:42;"Like I would think it would be cool if Greta Van Fleet was like"
01:09:42;01:09:44;"You know, if they were on the red carpet, like ""You guys excited?"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"Do you think you got a shot at winning best new artist?"""
01:09:46;01:09:48;"And they should say like, ""No, man"
01:09:48;01:09:50;"We're four crazy cousins from Michigan"
01:09:50;01:09:52;"Love Led Zeppelin"
01:09:52;01:09:54;"The fact that we're even here is hilarious"
01:09:54;01:09:56;"An absolute fluke"
01:09:58;01:10:00;"Goes to anybody else"
01:10:00;01:10:02;"We would love for Dua Lipa to get it, she's Albanian"
01:10:02;01:10:04;"That's super cool"
01:10:04;01:10:06;"For us, we're just dying with laughter"
01:10:06;01:10:08;"The fact that we're even here"
01:10:08;01:10:10;"Our place is back at home"
01:10:10;01:10:12;"In our dad's garage"
01:10:12;01:10:14;"Learning Zeppelin riffs"
01:10:14;01:10:16;"That's what I want to hear from Greta Van Fleet"
01:10:16;01:10:18;"But get back to us"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"When we enter our houses of the holy era"
01:10:20;01:10:22;"Right, that's fair"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"That's when we want to be under serious consideration"
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Check in with us in a few years"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"And we'll be back"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"It's a long way to take what we're doing now"
01:10:30;01:10:32;"And make it intersect a little more with modern"
01:10:32;01:10:34;"Oh, I guess maybe they're already doing it"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"That would be dope actually"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Because like, every Zeppelin album is so different"
01:10:38;01:10:40;"From the previous one"
01:10:40;01:10:42;"So that would be cool if Greta took that model"
01:10:42;01:10:44;"That's true"
01:10:44;01:10:46;"And like every album was just like way different"
01:10:46;01:10:48;"I think it could happen"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"We're pulling for you Greta"
01:10:50;01:10:52;"I'm definitely pulling for them"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"I don't want you to win best new artist"
01:10:54;01:10:56;"I want you to win best elder"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"That's just a compliment"
01:10:58;01:11:00;"You know what man"
01:11:00;01:11:02;"I'm trying to think of like"
01:11:02;01:11:04;"Who's like an older artist"
01:11:04;01:11:06;"Who showed vampire some love"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"In the early days"
01:11:08;01:11:10;"Crosby dude"
01:11:10;01:11:12;"Crosby showed some slight love"
01:11:12;01:11:14;"Chris Martin showed some real love"
01:11:14;01:11:16;"That always really touched me"
01:11:16;01:11:18;"Coldplayed huge and he like shouted out Vampire Weekend"
01:11:18;01:11:20;"I've always been a fan of his too, I appreciate it"
01:11:20;01:11:22;"Again, that's why you prefer Coldplay to Radiohead"
01:11:22;01:11:24;"I don't subscribe to the notion that Coldplay is just a post Radiohead"
01:11:24;01:11:26;"Whatever, they did their thing"
01:11:26;01:11:28;"They're on their own trip"
01:11:28;01:11:30;"Now I'm just trying to think like"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"It's like, you know Greta"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"I want to give you guys some advice"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"And this is something that when Vampire was starting out"
01:11:36;01:11:38;"Actually Marcy Playground said to me"
01:11:38;01:11:40;"Just like this"
01:11:40;01:11:42;"Fully"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"Random"
01:11:44;01:11:46;"Alternate history of rock"
01:11:46;01:11:48;"That's like"
01:11:48;01:11:50;"The 90s were the Marcy Playground era"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"That gave way in the mid 2000s"
01:11:52;01:11:54;"To Vampire"
01:11:54;01:11:56;"Who then handed the torch to Greta Van Fleet"
01:11:56;01:11:58;"Rock history man"
01:11:58;01:12:00;"That's a head scratcher"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"Post like a really earnest"
01:12:02;01:12:04;"YouTube video"
01:12:04;01:12:06;"In my study"
01:12:06;01:12:08;"Greta Van Fleet, today's your first Grammys"
01:12:08;01:12:10;"I've been there a couple times myself"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"And I want to tell you something that Marcy Playground said to me"
01:12:12;01:12:14;"When I was about your age"
01:12:14;01:12:16;"Just have a good time"
01:12:16;01:12:18;"Listen, rock's played out dog"
01:12:18;01:12:20;"We're not here to take awards away from the Dua Lipas of the world"
01:12:20;01:12:22;"Sure, we get an invite"
01:12:22;01:12:24;"We'll show up"
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Maybe even sneak in some Jack Daniels in a flask"
01:12:26;01:12:28;"For old times sake"
01:12:28;01:12:30;"But we're just having a good time"
01:12:30;01:12:32;"Our place is in the garage"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"Noodling on guitar"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"Getting high listening to Led Zeppelin"
01:12:36;01:12:38;"That's who we are, that's our tradition"
01:12:38;01:12:40;"We're happy to be here but we're not here to take awards away from B.B. Rexha"
01:12:40;01:12:42;"Or Luke Combs"
01:12:42;01:12:44;"Alright"
01:12:44;01:12:46;"We're humble rock enthusiasts"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"I'll be interested to see"
01:12:48;01:12:50;"Because Greta Van Fleet is far and away the band that I know the least about"
01:12:50;01:12:52;"That I've talked about the most"
01:12:52;01:12:54;"On this show"
01:12:54;01:12:56;"So, you know, I'm really hoping that they're kind of like"
01:12:56;01:12:58;"Humble, vibey dudes"
01:12:58;01:13:00;"With a Borgesian sense of humor"
01:13:00;01:13:02;"It would really break my heart if like"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"They lose the Best New Artist Grammy"
01:13:04;01:13:06;"And they go off and be like"
01:13:06;01:13:08;"The Grammys don't appreciate real music"
01:13:08;01:13:10;"That would break my heart"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"That's not what I want from GVF"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"I don't think that's the vibe"
01:13:14;01:13:16;"I watched their SNL performance, did you see it?"
01:13:16;01:13:18;"Oh, I watched it live, very divisive"
01:13:18;01:13:20;"It was cute"
01:13:20;01:13:22;"They seemed like they were having a fun time, they seemed nervous"
01:13:22;01:13:24;"And they were having a fun time"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"It was cute"
01:13:26;01:13:28;"And the people I was watching with did not agree"
01:13:28;01:13:30;"Some people were roasting them a little bit"
01:13:30;01:13:32;"And I said, like it or not"
01:13:32;01:13:34;"This is one of the best sounding"
01:13:34;01:13:36;"SNL performances in years"
01:13:36;01:13:38;"And a lot of people were like"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"No, I hate the way it sounds"
01:13:40;01:13:42;"And I was like, no, no, you hate the band"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"You hate the music, you hate the singer"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"I was just like, these guys"
01:13:46;01:13:48;"Play really well"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"And for what they're doing"
01:13:50;01:13:52;"It was one of the most well mixed, clear"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"Performances in a long time"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"And SNL is famously hard to nail"
01:13:56;01:13:58;"It's so stressful playing SNL"
01:13:58;01:14:00;"Just because you're in the booth, oh, did that sound okay?"
01:14:00;01:14:02;"And it's live and whatever"
01:14:02;01:14:04;"And you've seen great artists"
01:14:04;01:14:06;"Have the worst mixes on SNL"
01:14:06;01:14:08;"And you're like, something got lost in communication"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Maybe this was just straight forward"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Rock and roll"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"No laptop on stage"
01:14:14;01:14:16;"But even sometimes the straight forward, well, yeah, that helps"
01:14:16;01:14:18;"But even sometimes the straight forward rock and roll"
01:14:18;01:14:20;"It's like, whoa, whoa, the drums were so quiet"
01:14:20;01:14:22;"This was just like very, you know"
01:14:22;01:14:24;"But the guy didn't have a huge pedal board"
01:14:24;01:14:26;"And they just play well, they didn't need a lot"
01:14:26;01:14:28;"So anyway, I might be on the losing end of that one"
01:14:28;01:14:30;"Just like I was in real time"
01:14:30;01:14:32;"I was just like, yeah, no, no, I know"
01:14:32;01:14:34;"You hate the music, but it's like"
01:14:34;01:14:36;"Well, it sounds good for what it is"
01:14:36;01:14:38;"And that's a tough room, man"
01:14:38;01:14:41;"It's a little demon's tale, well"
01:14:41;01:14:44;"Where they look out to the land"
01:14:44;01:14:47;"And see the people quickly passing by"
01:14:47;01:14:51;"This is for their own desire"
01:14:51;01:14:54;"As they spit down to the earth"
01:14:54;01:14:57;"To feel the power pouring in their veins"
01:14:57;01:15:01;"Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
01:15:01;01:15:03;"Yeah"
01:15:03;01:15:06;"Yeah"
01:15:07;01:15:11;"Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh"
01:15:11;01:15:13;"Yeah"
01:15:13;01:15:16;"Yeah"
01:15:16;01:15:21;"And the pipes go crazy"
01:15:21;01:15:25;"From the fires we've been told"
01:15:25;01:15:30;"It's the way it's crazy"
01:15:30;01:15:33;"And we will stand up in the cold"
01:15:33;01:15:38;"Stand up in the cold"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"Are you ready to bang out this top five?"
01:15:40;01:15:41;"Yeah"
01:15:41;01:15:44;"It's time for the top five"
01:15:44;01:15:47;"F-f-f-f-f-five on iTunes"
01:15:47;01:15:53;"This week on the top five, we're comparing the top five songs on iTunes right now, 2019"
01:15:53;01:15:56;"To the top five Billboard hits this week in what year?"
01:15:56;01:15:57;"1959"
01:15:57;01:15:59;"We're going back to the year the music died"
01:15:59;01:16:01;"This might be the earliest top five we've done"
01:16:01;01:16:03;"We got so stuck in the 70s for a while"
01:16:03;01:16:04;"Yeah, 70s, 80s"
01:16:04;01:16:08;"I know we love the 70s here, but we're starting to mix it up, I appreciate that"
01:16:08;01:16:09;"So the number five song"
01:16:09;01:16:14;"So this was like a week after the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"I wonder if that's going to affect the charts"
01:16:16;01:16:21;"Yeah, I don't know how it worked back then, if there would have been time for that to impact it"
01:16:21;01:16:24;"But number five is by a guy named Bill Parsons, the All-American Boy"
01:16:30;01:16:36;"Gather 'round cats and I'll tell you a story about how to become an All-American Boy"
01:16:36;01:16:39;"Buy your guitar and put it in your pocket"
01:16:39;01:16:41;"Was Johnny Cash up and running at this point? Probably, right?"
01:16:41;01:16:43;"I think he was around"
01:16:43;01:16:47;"I think he was, he played shows with Elvis and stuff in the 50s, so I bet"
01:16:47;01:16:57;"This is a cool song, but makes you appreciate the tasteful minimalism of those Buddy Holly records even more"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"Yeah, this is kind of noisy"
01:16:59;01:17:00;"A little too wet"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"Yeah, it's hard with reverb"
01:17:28;01:17:34;"It's funny how with music it's like as soon as something's big like rock and roll, there's already kind of like self-aware"
01:17:34;01:17:35;"Yeah"
01:17:35;01:17:38;"Ironic songs about it like ""I'm rock and roll"""
01:17:38;01:17:40;"My daddy doesn't like rock and roll"
01:17:40;01:17:52;"Swingin' cats are havin' a ball"
01:17:52;01:17:55;"I wonder how old that guy was, like 21?"
01:17:55;01:17:56;"Yeah"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"Just doing this kind of deadpan ironic"
01:17:59;01:18:02;"I guess that's a real tradition of like the kind of talky verse"
01:18:02;01:18:03;"Yeah"
01:18:03;01:18:07;"""Wanna know who's got herself a big brown beaver and shows off her primus?"""
01:18:07;01:18:09;"Referencing Johnny B. Goode too"
01:18:09;01:18:11;"Johnny B. Goode"
01:18:11;01:18:13;"The number 5 song back in our era"
01:18:13;01:18:15;"It's funny, that song's called ""The All-American Boy"""
01:18:15;01:18:17;"This one's called ""Girls Like You"""
01:18:17;01:18:19;"Is this..."
01:18:19;01:18:20;"This is the one I was just talking about"
01:18:20;01:18:21;"Number 5?"
01:18:21;01:18:23;"So this is on the charts 'cause"
01:18:25;01:18:26;"This is the Super Bowl I guess?"
01:18:26;01:18:27;"Yeah"
01:18:27;01:18:28;"This is a while ago"
01:18:28;01:18:31;"I like everything about this song except for the nonsense chorus"
01:18:31;01:18:35;"I like a certain type of nonsense, I don't like this type of nonsense"
01:18:35;01:18:37;"I do love that finger sounds on the guitar"
01:18:37;01:18:39;"*imitates guitar*"
01:18:39;01:18:52;"Roll that backward, baby"
01:18:52;01:18:53;"*imitates guitar*"

01:19:57;01:20:12;"♫ What I want when I come through ♫ ♫ I need a girl like you ♫"
01:20:12;01:20:15;"The logic is just so circular I can't get over it."
01:20:15;01:20:16;"Why am I supposed to like you again?"
01:20:16;01:20:20;"Because girls like you, you know, run around with guys like me 'til sundown so when I come"
01:20:20;01:20:21;"through I need a girl like you."
01:20:21;01:20:22;"It just is."
01:20:22;01:20:23;"Just is."
01:20:23;01:20:28;"I love that '94 song back in 1959, ""The Platters, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes."""
01:20:28;01:20:29;"It's a real classic."
01:20:29;01:20:46;"♫ They asked me how I knew my true love was true ♫"
01:20:46;01:20:54;"Gorgeous."
01:20:54;01:20:55;"Beautiful singing."
01:20:55;01:20:56;"Like what genre is that?"
01:20:56;01:20:57;"Is that sort of like American songbook?"
01:20:57;01:20:58;"Is that?"
01:20:58;01:20:59;"Well, the song is composed by Jerome Kern."
01:20:59;01:21:05;"Was that like a new song at the time or like?"
01:21:05;01:21:06;"No, no."
01:21:06;01:21:07;"See, this is funny."
01:21:07;01:21:09;"Yeah, Jerome Kern, he did musicals."
01:21:09;01:21:14;"So it's written by Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach for a musical called ""Roberta,"" 1933."
01:21:14;01:21:15;"Oh, wow."
01:21:15;01:21:20;"I think I used to have some CD or something that was like the greatest hits of 1959."
01:21:20;01:21:21;"Really?"
01:21:21;01:21:25;"Yeah, actually that was like a set of tapes that I had when I was a kid for random years"
01:21:25;01:21:27;"that Billboard made."
01:21:27;01:21:28;"I kind of remember those tapes."
01:21:28;01:21:30;"And it was like the top 10 Billboard hits of 1962."
01:21:30;01:21:31;"Right."
01:21:31;01:21:34;"Those ones made a big impression on me."
01:21:34;01:21:35;"But I remember listening, or this might have been different."
01:21:35;01:21:40;"This might have been a CD, but I had this CD that was like the top hits of 1959."
01:21:40;01:21:43;"And I always remember this one jumped out at me because it's such a beautiful song."
01:21:43;01:21:45;"I want to look at the lyrics for a second."
01:21:45;01:21:47;"It's a really strong opening."
01:21:47;01:21:53;"They asked me how I knew my true love was true."
01:21:53;01:21:57;"I of course replied, ""Something here inside cannot be denied."
01:21:57;01:22:00;"They said someday you'll find all who love are blind."
01:22:00;01:22:03;"When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."""
01:22:03;01:22:05;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:22:05;01:22:08;"If your heart's on fire, that's a good thing."
01:22:08;01:22:09;"You're passionate."
01:22:09;01:22:10;"But what else does fire cause?"
01:22:10;01:22:11;"Smoke."
01:22:11;01:22:13;"It gets in your eyes and then it blinds you."
01:22:13;01:22:14;"So it's the same as love is blindness."
01:22:14;01:22:16;"Oh, I like this song."
01:22:16;01:22:18;"It's just like a whole story."
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Everybody would say, ""How do you know your true love is so true?"""
01:22:20;01:22:21;"And I'd say, ""I mean, isn't it obvious?"
01:22:21;01:22:22;"It can't be denied."""
01:22:22;01:22:23;"And they're like, ""Yeah, you know, watch out."""
01:22:23;01:22:24;"They said someday you'll find all who love are blind."
01:22:24;01:22:25;"When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:22:25;01:22:26;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:22:26;01:22:27;"If your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:22:27;01:22:28;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:22:28;01:22:29;"If your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:22:29;01:22:30;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:22:30;01:22:31;"If your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:22:31;01:22:32;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:22:32;01:22:55;"If your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:22:55;01:23:19;"Oh, that's what it means."
01:23:19;01:23:47;"If your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes."
01:23:47;01:23:51;"You got a little bit too excited about the wrong person, but you also need some new friends."
01:23:51;01:23:55;"Yeah, I mean, they shouldn't be piling on."
01:23:55;01:23:58;"Well, she left me."
01:23:58;01:24:01;"Told you, dog."
01:24:01;01:24:04;"Told you, you moron."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"It's so high style and..."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"He's got to put on a smile for them."
01:24:08;01:24:09;"Tears of a clown, dude."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"When your lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes."

01:33:16;01:33:18;"Do you remember there was this whole thing, Second Life?"
01:33:18;01:33:19;"It was kind of Sims-y."

01:33:39;01:33:41;"there'd be performances and stuff,"
01:33:41;01:33:43;"but Fortnite is a very popular game"
01:33:43;01:33:45;"on my new Nintendo Switch,"

01:33:47;01:33:48;"- Nice."

01:33:56;01:33:58;"who are like sick of video games,"
01:33:58;01:33:59;"so I've also heard that Nintendo Switch"
01:33:59;01:34:01;"is not the way to play it."
01:34:01;01:34:02;"- I was talking to a friend of mine this weekend"
01:34:02;01:34:05;"who's in the TV movie world,"
01:34:05;01:34:06;"and I was like, ""What are you watching right now?"""
01:34:06;01:34:09;"He's like, ""Nothing, man, I'm playing Red Dead--"""

01:34:17;01:34:18;"like fighting dudes or whatever."
01:34:18;01:34:19;"He just goes to these lakes"
01:34:19;01:34:21;"and just hunts and fishes for hours."
01:34:21;01:34:22;"- It's just like Westworld."
01:34:22;01:34:24;"- Yeah, I was just like, ""That is (beep) crazy, dude."""
01:34:24;01:34:26;"- You think you could ever get in?"
01:34:26;01:34:27;"- No."
01:34:27;01:34:27;"- You don't think you get into--"
01:34:27;01:34:29;"- I don't like games, man."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"I don't like board games."
01:34:30;01:34:32;"- But you like the great outdoors in the American West."
01:34:32;01:34:34;"- Yeah, I do."
01:34:34;01:34:36;"- So you don't think you could have fun just fishing and--"
01:34:36;01:34:37;"- No."
01:34:37;01:34:38;"- I don't know."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"I think you should give it a shot."
01:34:39;01:34:41;"- Cool project for 2019."
01:34:41;01:34:42;"- One thing about video games--"
01:34:42;01:34:43;"- I can't get sucked in."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"- Do you remember there was like an old Tim and Eric,"
01:34:45;01:34:47;"God, I can't even remember what it was called,"
01:34:47;01:34:50;"but the joke was basically that Eric was really excited,"
01:34:50;01:34:53;"or maybe, you know, I might have the roles reversed."
01:34:53;01:34:54;"It's been a long time."
01:34:54;01:34:57;"Eric was very excited to go to Tim's birthday party"
01:34:57;01:34:58;"and he can't wait for it."
01:34:58;01:35:00;"And Tim's birthday's in three weeks."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"And he's like, ""I just can't wait."
01:35:01;01:35:02;"""I wish I was going to his party now."""
01:35:02;01:35:04;"And then basically he takes a pill,"
01:35:04;01:35:06;"probably manufactured by Cinco,"
01:35:06;01:35:10;"that basically, if you're really excited for something,"
01:35:10;01:35:11;"you don't want to deal with it,"
01:35:11;01:35:13;"every time in between knocks you out."
01:35:13;01:35:16;"So he does this thing where he takes this pill"
01:35:16;01:35:18;"so that he can just lose the next three weeks"
01:35:18;01:35:20;"so he can go straight to the birthday party."
01:35:20;01:35:21;"It was so funny."
01:35:21;01:35:23;"It made a big impression on me."
01:35:23;01:35:24;"- I can't wait."
01:35:24;01:35:25;"- I just can't wait."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"And then something happens where, of course,"
01:35:27;01:35:29;"it's like a dark tale that like,"
01:35:29;01:35:30;"then he doesn't wake up for years"
01:35:30;01:35:32;"or it like eats into his brain or something."
01:35:32;01:35:34;"That's the joke, is just like, I just can't,"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"I can't wait three weeks."
01:35:35;01:35:37;"Like, well, now there's something you can do about it."
01:35:37;01:35:38;"So I've always thought about that."
01:35:38;01:35:41;"And one of the few things that I've found,"
01:35:41;01:35:42;"you know, like sometimes you're at home"
01:35:42;01:35:44;"and you always perceive time differently."
01:35:44;01:35:45;"And you know, you could,"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"there's certain things you could do,"
01:35:47;01:35:50;"watch TV, take a walk, make a phone call,"
01:35:50;01:35:51;"go on the internet."
01:35:51;01:35:52;"There's a lot of ways to waste time."
01:35:52;01:35:56;"Video games are the closest thing that I've ever experienced"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"to that Tim and Eric vibe of just like,"
01:35:58;01:36:01;"oh man, 45 minutes until the Postmates comes?"
01:36:01;01:36:03;"That's going to be boring."
01:36:03;01:36:04;"Like you could start like reading the New York Times"
01:36:04;01:36:06;"or even go on Twitter or something."
01:36:06;01:36:08;"You're kind of like, you feel that non video games."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"If when you're like really addicted to a video game,"
01:36:11;01:36:13;"which has happened to me since I got the Switch,"
01:36:13;01:36:15;"it's truly the closest thing I ever had"
01:36:15;01:36:17;"to being like, almost like taking that pill,"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"like 45 minutes till the Postmates comes."
01:36:19;01:36:20;"- Gone."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"- Well, I guess I might as well start playing this."
01:36:22;01:36:24;"And really sometimes I feel like I open my eyes"
01:36:24;01:36:26;"and be like, ding dong."
01:36:26;01:36:28;"It's like, great, the Buffalo wings are here."
01:36:28;01:36:29;"- Wow, your life, man."
01:36:29;01:36:31;"You've gotten addicted to a game in the last month."
01:36:31;01:36:33;"- Oh, you know, we had some fun playing stuff."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"And, but we had fun playing Mario Party."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"I was telling you about that."
01:36:37;01:36:40;"We had a good time playing that with Ariel and Daniel."
01:36:40;01:36:42;"And I thought maybe I'll get really into Fortnite,"
01:36:42;01:36:44;"but I was kind of bewildered by it."
01:36:44;01:36:46;"And I was like, oh, is it the building?"
01:36:46;01:36:48;"And when I started playing it,"
01:36:48;01:36:50;"I like actually plugged it into the TV."
01:36:50;01:36:53;"And immediately there was that vibe of just like,"
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I was on a team and just like a bunch of 12 year olds,"
01:36:55;01:36:58;"like yelling, like super distorted into their,"
01:36:58;01:37:00;"dude."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"Yeah, seriously."
01:37:02;01:37:04;"I forget somebody had like the funniest name."
01:37:04;01:37:07;"Like I like shot somebody on our team by accident."
01:37:07;01:37:10;"It was like, he killed Broccoli Man."
01:37:10;01:37:12;"Like this, that kind of, anyway, so that was a whole,"
01:37:12;01:37:13;"that was pretty bewildering."
01:37:13;01:37:15;"But then they had a thing where you could download"
01:37:15;01:37:20;"a kind of like emulator where you had 30 OG NES games."
01:37:20;01:37:21;"So, you know, we were having fun."
01:37:21;01:37:23;"We were playing like Super Mario"
01:37:23;01:37:24;"and all like the real old school stuff."
01:37:24;01:37:26;"And then at some point it came across this game"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"that I'd never played before."
01:37:27;01:37:29;"And it's called Wario's Woods."
01:37:29;01:37:31;"People are probably familiar with the character Wario."
01:37:31;01:37:33;"He's the Bizarro Mario."
01:37:33;01:37:34;"You guys know this game, Wario Woods?"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"Oh, you know, but it's not like a very famous game, is it?"
01:37:37;01:37:41;"So basically after the huge success of Tetris,"
01:37:41;01:37:42;"this is kind of like one of those time crisis moments"
01:37:42;01:37:45;"like when we go deep into sports knowing nothing about it."
01:37:45;01:37:46;"Right, I'm already lost."
01:37:46;01:37:49;"Yeah, you're listening to Time Crisis."
01:37:49;01:37:51;"This segment is sponsored by GameStop."
01:37:51;01:37:53;"We're just counting down the newest games."
01:37:53;01:37:55;"So this game, Wario Woods, I guess Tetris,"
01:37:55;01:37:57;"obviously we all know Tetris,"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"but that was not Nintendo intellectual property."
01:38:00;01:38:02;"So they made a lot of their own puzzle games"
01:38:02;01:38:03;"like Dr. Mario, for instance."
01:38:03;01:38:06;"And there's this other puzzle game called Wario's Woods"
01:38:06;01:38:07;"where you're toad and you're running around"
01:38:07;01:38:10;"and you're flipping things and putting them in lines and stuff."
01:38:10;01:38:11;"I was like, ""Oh, I never played this game before."""
01:38:11;01:38:12;"And I started playing it."
01:38:12;01:38:15;"And the next thing you know, truly like two weeks went by"
01:38:15;01:38:17;"where I just became obsessed with,"
01:38:17;01:38:18;"of course I beat the whole game."
01:38:18;01:38:21;"And then I just became obsessed with like going back"
01:38:21;01:38:23;"and seeing how quickly I could beat levels"
01:38:23;01:38:25;"and trying every different mode there was."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"And it's funny, I have one friend,"
01:38:27;01:38:29;"you know, everything's like network now."
01:38:29;01:38:30;"Yeah."
01:38:30;01:38:32;"So my only friend is this guy, Buddy."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"He's a great musician."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"He plays on the record and I know him through RL."
01:38:36;01:38:38;"And I guess we'd played Smash Brothers together"
01:38:38;01:38:39;"once or something."
01:38:39;01:38:41;"And then I saw him like a month later and he was like,"
01:38:41;01:38:42;"and I didn't realize that everybody sees what you're doing."
01:38:42;01:38:45;"He's like, ""You've been playing a lot of Wario's Woods, man."
01:38:45;01:38:46;"That's kind of random."""
01:38:46;01:38:48;"(laughing)"
01:38:48;01:38:49;"- That's public, wow."
01:38:49;01:38:51;"- I guess it's public to your friends."
01:38:51;01:38:53;"And it was like causing problems."
01:38:53;01:38:55;"I was definitely got addicted to it."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"- Really?"
01:38:56;01:38:57;"- Yeah, and I couldn't stop thinking about it."
01:38:57;01:38:59;"I think it (beep) up my sleep for a couple months"
01:38:59;01:39:00;"'cause you know-"
01:39:00;01:39:01;"- Wait, whoa."
01:39:01;01:39:02;"- Well, I mean, I'm guessing here."
01:39:02;01:39:03;"- Damn, dude."
01:39:03;01:39:06;"- I had a lot on my mind too, releasing music and stuff."
01:39:06;01:39:07;"- Yeah."
01:39:07;01:39:08;"- I also might just be getting to that age"
01:39:08;01:39:10;"where you don't sleep nine hours anymore or whatever."
01:39:10;01:39:11;"- Oh, sure."
01:39:11;01:39:14;"- But you know, like everybody famously had Tetris dreams"
01:39:14;01:39:15;"when they play a lot of Tetris, right?"
01:39:15;01:39:18;"I was having Wario Woods dreams."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"- Wow."
01:39:19;01:39:21;"- And I've heard from other people, I won't name them"
01:39:21;01:39:23;"because I don't know if they want to talk about it."
01:39:23;01:39:25;"Maybe I'll see if this person wants to come on the show,"
01:39:25;01:39:27;"but I was talking to another musician"
01:39:27;01:39:30;"and they were telling me about getting so addicted"
01:39:30;01:39:34;"to a Switch game that they got some weird thing"
01:39:34;01:39:36;"that you can lie backwards in bed and like hold,"
01:39:36;01:39:37;"I guess you could just do this."
01:39:37;01:39:38;"- Whoa."
01:39:38;01:39:39;"- And they would just be,"
01:39:39;01:39:41;"they would play for four or five hours at a time."
01:39:41;01:39:42;"I forget what game they got addicted to."
01:39:42;01:39:43;"I don't know if it was Zelda or,"
01:39:43;01:39:47;"what's a big Switch game like Dragon Quest, Fire Lord?"
01:39:47;01:39:48;"I can't tell."
01:39:48;01:39:50;"- That's like Michelangelo working on the Sistine Chapel"
01:39:50;01:39:51;"on his back."
01:39:51;01:39:53;"- Base, yeah, just gaming."
01:39:53;01:39:54;"- Yeah, see, I hear these stories"
01:39:54;01:39:57;"and I'm just like, no thanks, yikes."
01:39:57;01:39:58;"- Well, that's the thing."
01:39:58;01:40:01;"It's obviously just like the Tim and Eric parable,"
01:40:01;01:40:03;"it's dangerous because I swear there were times"
01:40:03;01:40:06;"where I was kind of just like had some time to kill."
01:40:06;01:40:08;"- I've never, yeah, I just, when I see the game,"
01:40:08;01:40:12;"like I never get a sense of like aesthetic or like narrative"
01:40:12;01:40:15;"or like philosophical or artistic satisfaction"
01:40:15;01:40:19;"out of video games the way you might from a good TV show,"
01:40:19;01:40:20;"good movie, a book."
01:40:20;01:40:23;"I just never have gotten that."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"- Let's get you Red Dead Redemption 2,"
01:40:24;01:40:26;"see how you feel."
01:40:26;01:40:28;"- I mean, I remember being a kid"
01:40:28;01:40:30;"and this is where we might have,"
01:40:30;01:40:32;"'cause you didn't have video games when you were a kid either."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"- No, I mean, as discussed, Lonnie did."
01:40:35;01:40:36;"- Right."
01:40:36;01:40:37;"- Lonnie was my video game outlet."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"- I feel like your brother got really into Tetris"
01:40:39;01:40:40;"at a certain point."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Doesn't that sound familiar, Dave being obsessed with Tetris?"
01:40:42;01:40:44;"- I think he might have when he was a kid, yeah."
01:40:44;01:40:46;"- I gotta get Dave into Wario Woods."
01:40:46;01:40:48;"By the way, if anybody else is a part"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"of the Wario's Woods fan community, hit me up."
01:40:51;01:40:54;"I'd like to grow this Wario Woods fan community."
01:40:54;01:40:55;"Maybe we should also get--"
01:40:55;01:40:56;"- Maybe just open the floodgates."
01:40:56;01:41:00;"- Petition Nintendo to also maybe update it,"
01:41:00;01:41:03;"maybe create a special version made for Switch."
01:41:03;01:41:04;"What are we doing here?"
01:41:04;01:41:05;"Oh yeah."
01:41:05;01:41:06;"- We're at top five, 59, what are we doing?"
01:41:06;01:41:08;"- Back to 59, The Crests."
01:41:08;01:41:10;"- Is this number two on 59?"
01:41:10;01:41:12;"- Yes, I think we all know this song."
