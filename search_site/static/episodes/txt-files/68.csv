00:00;00:03;"Time Crisis, back once again."
00:03;00:10;"It is with a heavy heart that today we must uncover a dark secret behind Tic Tacs, one"
00:10;00:11;"of America's favorite mints."
00:11;00:18;"We'll also be talking Doritos with Phil Matariz, creator of the HBO comedy Animals."
00:18;00:23;"We'll also be joined by Chris Baio to debut his Sting and Shaggy remix."
00:23;00:28;"All this, plus the greatest hits of 2018 and 1969."
00:28;00:35;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra King."
01:20;01:23;"Time Crisis, back once again."
01:23;01:25;"It feels like it's been a long time."
01:25;01:31;"Because the real hardcore TC heads, I wonder if they realize that the last episode was"
01:31;01:33;"recorded weeks in advance."
01:33;01:34;"Deeply canned."
01:34;01:36;"A little radio magic."
01:36;01:40;"That's the one that we had Dev and Dave and Despot, RL."
01:40;01:45;"The reason that we pre-recorded that one is because Jake was going on his honeymoon."
01:45;01:46;"That's right."
01:46;01:49;"Long-time listeners may remember that Jake got married."
01:49;01:51;"How long have you been married now?"
01:51;01:52;"Eight months."
01:52;01:54;"Got married in September of 2017."
01:54;01:56;"You just did a delayed honeymoon?"
01:56;01:58;"Yeah, delayed HM."
01:58;02:00;"What, you went to Italy?"
02:00;02:01;"Went to Italy."
02:01;02:02;"How was it?"
02:02;02:03;"Great trip."
02:03;02:08;"I believe we talked about it before you went that that was your first time in Europe in"
02:08;02:10;"almost 20 years."
02:10;02:15;"Yeah, I went in 2002 with Wolf Kernel."
02:15;02:16;"On tour?"
02:16;02:17;"Yeah."
02:17;02:20;"Renowned K-Records band, Wolf Kernel."
02:20;02:21;"Played drums on that tour."
02:21;02:22;"Oh, really?"
02:22;02:23;"I don't play drums anymore."
02:23;02:25;"I've never seen you play drums."
02:25;02:26;"I'm not that good."
02:26;02:28;"My drumming on that tour was very basic."
02:28;02:32;"So you were slapping the tubs for Wolf Kernel on a 2002 European tour."
02:32;02:33;"Yep."
02:33;02:35;"And that was the last time you checked across the Atlantic."
02:35;02:36;"Yep."
02:36;02:37;"So that's a big deal."
02:37;02:42;"It's a long time to be away from Europe."
02:42;02:45;"Did it feel like a big deal to be like setting foot in Italy?"
02:45;02:47;"A big deal in what sense?"
02:47;02:52;"I guess I always think for me that I think the first time I ever left the country I was"
02:52;02:55;"a teenager, like 14 with my family."
02:55;03:02;"And I think about those early trips I took from age like 14 to 22 a few times and everything"
03:02;03:06;"about it, going to the airport was such a big deal because I hadn't been on planes that"
03:06;03:08;"much as a child, basically not at all as a child."
03:08;03:12;"And there's something about like being a teen, you know, leaving the country and things feeling"
03:12;03:13;"so different."
03:13;03:14;"You notice everything."
03:14;03:18;"And it's kind of like you're in a dream the whole time you're in this other place."
03:18;03:19;"Right."
03:19;03:22;"I even remember going to Canada the first time, which I think was on a Dirty Projectors tour"
03:22;03:25;"and like being in Toronto and like the money being different."
03:25;03:27;"Just what are all these Tim Hortons everywhere?"
03:27;03:28;"Yeah."
03:28;03:30;"Just being shocked by the density of Tim Hortons."
03:30;03:36;"Then in my twenties, Vampire Weekend toured like crazy to the point that, you know, you're"
03:36;03:38;"like rolling through Amsterdam for like the fifth time or something."
03:38;03:42;"You're just kind of like, yeah, you're like jet lagged and you kind of like draw the curtain"
03:42;03:44;"and just say whatever."
03:44;03:48;"And then it's actually, I haven't traveled that much in the hiatus years."
03:48;03:53;"So I guess I was kind of thinking like, as you get older, is leaving the country less"
03:53;03:54;"exciting?"
03:54;03:57;"Did I just get a little bit like jaded from touring too much?"
03:57;04:00;"Will I be kind of psyched when I get back over there?"
04:00;04:06;"Did you do any international tourism for leisure in the last few years?"
04:06;04:07;"Not really."
04:07;04:08;"I mean, I know you went to Hawaii."
04:08;04:09;"Went to Hawaii."
04:09;04:10;"That's part of the US."
04:10;04:11;"But it's exotic."
04:11;04:12;"It's not mainland."
04:12;04:14;"I was just hitting McDonald's every day."
04:14;04:16;"I was, you know, nothing fancy."
04:16;04:18;"I mean, I've left the country here and there."
04:18;04:20;"There's been some trips, but really I've been kind of like..."
04:20;04:21;"Holding it down."
04:21;04:24;"Yeah, I've been holding it down in the old US of A."

05:07;05:09;"- Also, I found that, especially when you go on tour a lot"
05:09;05:12;"and you'd be in like the really big cities,"
05:12;05:13;"like London and Paris a lot,"
05:13;05:15;"the more time you'd spend there,"
05:15;05:18;"the more you'd kind of realize how global culture"
05:18;05:21;"was kind of like bending into one thing."
05:21;05:21;"- Sure."
05:21;05:23;"- So even on that level,"
05:23;05:24;"those like feelings I associate"
05:24;05:26;"with the first times I ever left the country"
05:26;05:28;"of being like everything's so different,"
05:28;05:31;"but then flash forward to being in like, you know,"
05:31;05:34;"Portland, LA, New York, London,"
05:34;05:36;"all like the same poke restaurant."
05:36;05:37;"- Wow."
05:37;05:38;"- And everybody kind of dresses the same,"
05:38;05:40;"but Italy's always been more its own thing."
05:40;05:40;"- Italy's not like that."
05:40;05:42;"I mean, maybe Milan would be like that"
05:42;05:44;"'cause we left for Milan."
05:44;05:45;"That definitely seemed more Northern,"
05:45;05:47;"but like in terms of the big towns,"
05:47;05:49;"Rome and Florence and Siena,"
05:49;05:51;"which I spent time in on this past trip,"
05:51;05:53;"definitely felt like a different trip."
05:53;05:57;"There weren't poke restaurants that I saw in those towns,"
05:57;05:59;"but I have to say--"
05:59;06:01;"- Ooh, that sounds like a good business opportunity for me."
06:01;06:03;"- I did see sushi restaurants."
06:03;06:07;"- Was it hard for you like with the lack of access to poke?"
06:07;06:09;"- Yeah, difficult."
06:09;06:10;"I made up for it."
06:10;06:12;"- Talking about cutting the trip short."
06:12;06:16;"- I made up for it by having pasta and red wine for lunch."
06:16;06:17;"- Nice."
06:17;06:19;"- We rented a car."
06:19;06:21;"And so we drew, I remember driving into Florence"
06:21;06:24;"and driving into Siena and noticing,"
06:24;06:25;"much like the cities in the US,"
06:25;06:27;"like the outskirts would be fully"
06:27;06:29;"internationally homogenized."
06:29;06:31;"There'd be like warehousing."
06:31;06:34;"You'd see like a Burger King, a Mickey D's, a Subway."
06:34;06:35;"- Car dealerships."
06:35;06:37;"- Hell yeah."
06:37;06:39;"And then you'd get within like the inner ring of the city."
06:39;06:41;"You'd like pass over the old moat"
06:41;06:45;"or like drive in some like narrow gateway,"
06:45;06:47;"like past the old city walls."
06:47;06:49;"And then like the zoning there must be insane"
06:49;06:52;"because there was like nothing built"
06:52;06:54;"after like the year 1000 or whatever"
06:54;06:56;"in any of these tiny."
06:56;06:57;"- And it seems like they have rules."
06:57;07:01;"Like Italy's done a good job of holding off Starbucks."
07:01;07:01;"- Oh, hell yeah."
07:01;07:03;"Oh, I didn't see any Starbucks."
07:03;07:04;"- I know there are some in Italy,"
07:04;07:07;"but I think there's a whole thing that like Starbucks said,"
07:07;07:09;"we're gonna make a big push in Italy."
07:09;07:10;"And then there's a lot of like blowback."
07:10;07:14;"- Well, Italy has very strong coffee culture."
07:14;07:14;"- Right."
07:15;07:20;"- So we flew back from Milan through Oslo to LA,"
07:20;07:22;"dipped into the Oslo airport for an hour."
07:22;07:24;"First thing I see, Starbucks."
07:24;07:25;"- Yeah."
07:25;07:26;"- And I was like, whoa,"
07:26;07:29;"come to think of it, haven't seen one in two and a half weeks."
07:29;07:30;"- Yeah."
07:30;07:32;"- That got the gears turned."
07:32;07:33;"- Yeah."
07:33;07:34;"- And I was like, yeah,"
07:34;07:37;"Italy has got very strong established coffee culture."
07:37;07:39;"- Which is something that you have to protect."
07:39;07:40;"- Hell yeah."
07:40;07:42;"- It's not as easy as just saying like,"
07:42;07:43;"well, our country has strong coffee culture,"
07:43;07:44;"so you don't want Starbucks."
07:44;07:47;"Actually like France also has strong coffee culture."
07:47;07:49;"- Are there Starbucks everywhere?"
07:49;07:50;"- I think there's some Starbucks,"
07:50;07:51;"but one thing I noticed over the years"
07:51;07:56;"that I've been going to Paris is the rise of the McCafe."
07:56;07:59;"- Is McCafe McDonald's with a coffee emphasis"
07:59;08:01;"or what is the McCafe?"
08:01;08:03;"- I think sometimes it's literally just the same menu,"
08:03;08:06;"but I've seen times where it was kind of like a kiosk"
08:06;08:10;"within a McDonald's that maybe had its own window"
08:10;08:12;"on the street where you could order a cappuccino,"
08:12;08:14;"something of that nature."
08:14;08:16;"- I was hitting cappuccinos in Italy."
08:16;08:17;"- And espressos?"
08:17;08:18;"- Big time."
08:18;08:20;"- It's just standing up at the bar."
08:20;08:24;"- Seinfeld number crunch on number of Starbucks in Italy."
08:24;08:26;"- I don't have the number of Starbucks,"
08:26;08:29;"but I will tell you that as of 2017,"
08:29;08:31;"there was zero Starbucks."
08:31;08:32;"- In the whole country?"
08:32;08:33;"- In Italy."
08:33;08:34;"- Sounds like a number to me."
08:34;08:35;"- Per eater."
08:35;08:38;"And they opened their first location in the whole country"
08:38;08:40;"this year."
08:40;08:41;"- In Milan?"
08:41;08:42;"- Yes."
08:42;08:43;"- Nailed that."
08:44;08:45;"- I feel great about that."
08:45;08:46;"- And I don't even know,"
08:46;08:48;"'cause I'm reading an article from 2017,"
08:48;08:49;"so I don't even know if that happened."
08:49;08:52;"It seems like they were just planning to do it."
08:52;08:54;"- Not a Starbucks country."
08:54;08:55;"- Respect."
08:55;08:56;"- That's cool."
08:56;08:57;"- Mad respect."
08:57;08:58;"Anyway, Italy ruled."
08:58;09:00;"- It's a great country."
09:39;09:40;"- Speaking of Italy, on today's show,"
09:40;09:44;"I wanna talk about one of my favorite Italian candies."
09:44;09:45;"- Okay."
09:45;09:47;"- I'm talking, of course, about Tic Tacs."
09:47;09:48;"- Didn't know that was Italian."
09:48;09:51;"- Yeah, neither did I until I looked it up today."
09:51;09:53;"- Why'd you look it up?"
09:53;09:56;"- Well, I think I was looking at Instagram,"
09:56;09:58;"maybe Twitter, definitely a social media platform."
09:58;10:00;"- One of the big two."
10:00;10:00;"- One of the big two."
10:00;10:02;"Maybe it was even Facebook."
10:02;10:03;"- You're not on Facebook."
10:03;10:04;"- I am on Facebook."
10:04;10:05;"- Are you?"
10:05;10:06;"- Yeah."
10:06;10:07;"- You look, but never post?"
10:07;10:09;"- I haven't posted in a long time."
10:09;10:11;"I mean, have we never talked about Facebook on this show?"
10:11;10:13;"- I know you're like an early adapter."
10:13;10:14;"- I'm an early adapter."
10:14;10:16;"- But I thought you bailed like 10 years ago."
10:16;10:18;"- I have reason to believe that I'm one of the first"
10:18;10:20;"2,000 people who was ever on Facebook."
10:20;10:21;"- That's tight."
10:21;10:22;"I mean, is it?"
10:22;10:26;"I bailed, dude."
10:26;10:28;"After the election, I bailed, but go ahead."
10:28;10:31;"- So anyway, I always associated Facebook"
10:31;10:34;"with like being a sophomore in college."
10:34;10:35;"- Right."
10:35;10:36;"- Then once I graduated, I didn't use it that much,"
10:36;10:38;"but and then also I had this weird thing"
10:38;10:40;"where people kept making fake accounts."
10:40;10:42;"Did I never tell this story?"
10:42;10:43;"- No, no."
10:43;10:45;"- I went to my 10th high school reunion"
10:45;10:47;"and I was talking to this dude, Ryan Ayers."
10:47;10:49;"Great dude, friend of mine."
10:49;10:50;"- Yeah."
10:50;10:51;"- I hadn't stayed that much in touch,"
10:51;10:52;"but a guy I really liked and we were like"
10:52;10:54;"having some beers at his parents' house."
10:54;10:57;"- What year is this, the high school reunion?"
10:57;10:59;"- I must've been 28."
10:59;11:00;"I remember I was finishing the last Vampire Weekend album"
11:00;11:03;"and me and Wes, one of my oldest friends."
11:03;11:05;"- Like 13?"
11:05;11:06;"No, wait."
11:06;11:06;"- No, 2012."
11:06;11:08;"This would have been 2012."
11:08;11:10;"So we're hanging out at this guy's parents' house"
11:10;11:13;"after the reunion and he was like,"
11:13;11:14;"""Hey, that's pretty cool."
11:14;11:16;"""When you posted that Smashing Pumpkins video"
11:16;11:18;"""the other day, I hadn't heard that song in a while."""
11:18;11:20;"And I was like, ""Posted on what?"""
11:20;11:21;"And he's like, ""On Facebook."""
11:21;11:23;"And I was like, ""I don't think I've actually"
11:23;11:24;"""posted anything on Facebook in a while."""
11:24;11:26;"And he's like, ""Yeah, you have."""
11:26;11:27;"And he showed me and there's like,"
11:27;11:29;"somebody had actively made a fake account"
11:29;11:31;"and they friended people I'd gotten to high school with"
11:31;11:33;"and they weren't even doing anything crazy."
11:33;11:35;"They were just like posting Smashing Pumpkins videos"
11:35;11:37;"and being like, ""Yo, remember the '90s"
11:37;11:39;"""when we were tweens?"""
11:39;11:40;"(laughs)"
11:40;11:42;"- That's crazy."
11:42;11:44;"- That kind of bugged me out 'cause I was like,"
11:44;11:47;"obviously there's a lot of potential for weirdness."
11:47;11:51;"And I remember I had some people hit up Facebook"
11:51;11:53;"and try to shut down a bunch of these fake accounts."
11:53;11:55;"But that was the worst."
11:55;11:56;"I'd never heard anything bad."
11:56;11:57;"I'd never heard somebody saying,"
11:57;12:01;"""Somebody (beep) started sending me crazy messages."""
12:01;12:03;"But that was just so unnerving."
12:03;12:05;"Just somebody holding it down just being like,"
12:05;12:06;"""Oh, I'm gonna get in trouble."""
12:06;12:10;"- So there were multiple Ezra Koenig fake accounts."
12:10;12:10;"- Yeah."
12:10;12:11;"And--"
12:11;12:14;"- And they were all just posting like SP videos."
12:14;12:15;"- I guess so."
12:15;12:17;"- That's an interesting impulse."
12:17;12:18;"- I mean, yeah, maybe it's just like somebody"
12:18;12:21;"would get home from work and just kind of imagine"
12:21;12:22;"what it would be like."
12:22;12:24;"And also it's interesting that this person"
12:24;12:26;"was like friending people I went to high school with."
12:26;12:29;"It's not like they were trying to like even,"
12:29;12:30;"maybe it was somebody I went to high school with"
12:30;12:31;"just being weird or something."
12:31;12:33;"- Yeah."
12:33;12:35;"It reminds me, this is kind of a weird story"
12:35;12:36;"because I've been doing this for a while."
12:36;12:38;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:38;12:39;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:39;12:40;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:41;12:43;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:50;12:51;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:54;12:55;"I've been doing this for a while."
12:57;13:03;"I've been doing this for a while."
13:10;13:11;"And they're like, what's your name?"
13:11;13:14;"And I said, Stephen Malchmus."
13:14;13:22;"Because huge pavement head at the time still am and I was"
13:22;13:25;"like this would be kind of funny for some of our younger"
13:25;13:28;"listeners or our older listeners who don't give a f***"
13:28;13:28;"about Indie Rock."
13:28;13:31;"Stephen Malchmus was in a band called Pavement considered"
13:31;13:33;"a seminal Indie Rock band of the 90s."
13:33;13:34;"Considered?"
13:34;13:38;"First of all, everyone that listens to this show, if they're"
13:38;13:42;"a Vampire Weekend fan gives an f*** about Indie Rock."
13:42;13:44;"I don't need you throwing shade at Indie Rock."
13:44;13:45;"Anyway, I'm not throwing shade."
13:45;13:47;"By the way, I was literally listening to Pavement last"
13:47;13:48;"night."
13:48;13:49;"What album?"
13:49;13:50;"Wowie Zowie."
13:50;13:51;"I love that record."
13:51;13:54;"I was wondering if Wowie Zowie was considered a double"
13:54;13:54;"album."
13:54;13:56;"Oh interesting."
13:56;13:57;"No, it's like 19 or 20 tracks."
13:57;13:58;"No, it's like a long."
13:58;13:59;"It's like an hour, right?"
13:59;14:00;"Not a double."
14:00;14:01;"But it's 18 songs."
14:01;14:02;"But it might be on vinyl."
14:02;14:03;"It might be four sides."
14:03;14:04;"Anyway, I was thinking about Pavement."
14:04;14:07;"I felt like it'd been fashionable to say you don't"
14:07;14:08;"like Pavement for a while."
14:09;14:10;"Because I think Pavement was considered kind of like the"
14:10;14:14;"old white male rock critic kind of thing."
14:14;14:16;"And it became kind of unfashionable."
14:16;14:18;"Like Pavement became a shorthand for being like, oh"
14:18;14:19;"what?"
14:19;14:21;"Great music is only made by Pavement."
14:21;14:22;"Right."
14:22;14:25;"Like nerdy, literate, college rock."
14:25;14:26;"Right."
14:26;14:28;"Whereas, you know, for a long time, like that got respect."
14:28;14:30;"Whereas pop or hip-hop didn't."
14:30;14:33;"Whereas now I think, at least in the critical universe, that"
14:33;14:34;"things have evened out."
14:34;14:36;"But anyway, I was thinking about Pavement and I was like,"
14:36;14:36;"you know what?"
14:36;14:38;"Pavement has some tunes, man."
14:38;14:41;"I'm not saying that Pavement is ever gonna top the year-end"
14:41;14:43;"lists again, let alone the charts."
14:43;14:45;"But I was like, you know what?"
14:45;14:48;"There's nothing cool about hating on Pavement."
14:48;14:49;"Throw us a Pavement."
14:49;14:54;"Maybe someone's gonna save me."
14:54;14:59;"My heart is made of gravy."
14:59;15:04;"And the lobsters swim from lunatics don't care."
15:04;15:07;"Open up your stocking."
15:07;15:12;"Pull out all the things you never wanted."
15:12;15:20;"Room service calls."
15:20;15:28;"Open up your pants and let me see the things you keep in there."
15:28;15:32;"I wanna split up 50/50."
15:32;15:36;"That's the way we do it in this rose town."
15:36;15:40;"I've got all the glory in the world."
15:40;15:44;"I hope it doesn't floor you before you go."
15:44;15:48;"Room service calls."
15:48;15:53;"In the random halls."
15:53;15:56;"I remember you used to hate on him like 10 years ago and I was"
15:56;15:58;"like, come on, man."
15:58;15:59;"I know you're flexing."
15:59;16:01;"You got you have like a young career going."
16:01;16:02;"You need to like flex him."
16:02;16:05;"You need to like front to like the previous generation, but I"
16:05;16:08;"was also like I was in between the generations."
16:08;16:08;"I was sort of like,"
16:08;16:10;"I never publicly hated on Pavement."
16:10;16:12;"Like to me, you would like be like, that band's whack and I'd"
16:12;16:13;"be like, get out of here."
16:13;16:15;"You're doing your music."
16:15;16:16;"They're doing come on, get out of here."
16:16;16:18;"So I'm glad you're back around."
16:18;16:20;"There are a lot of pavement songs that I like."
16:20;16:22;"No, Pavement's cool."
16:22;16:24;"And also think look, it's yeah, you're right."
16:24;16:26;"It's always okay."
16:26;16:28;"That's been that's been settled."
16:28;16:31;"It's always been cool."
16:31;16:33;"It's and also first of all, I do respect pavement."
16:33;16:35;"I respect Stephen Malcom missed a lot."
16:35;16:36;"So I would have never said anything publicly."
16:36;16:38;"Although I feel like he said something publicly weird about"
16:38;16:39;"Vampire Weekend before."
16:39;16:40;"Did he?"
16:40;16:41;"That's just what happens."
16:41;16:44;"Yeah, the old head generations, man."
16:44;16:47;"Yeah, just like it's about time for me to start talking about"
16:47;16:50;"some young stuff talking smack about sheer mag."
16:50;16:53;"No, I was sure mag."
16:53;16:56;"I have the mouth miss interview where he talks about what"
16:56;16:57;"he's saying."
16:57;16:58;"It's all positive."
16:58;16:58;"Oh, really?"
16:58;17:00;"Maybe it's not the same one then."
17:00;17:02;"There's something glowing about them."
17:02;17:03;"I don't know what it is."
17:03;17:07;"It's like an Apple disrespectful Coca-Cola thing where people"
17:08;17:10;"don't know why but they just want it."
17:10;17:12;"Okay, so it's a little bit backhanded."
17:12;17:17;"Maybe like comparing the band to Coca-Cola, but that's his"
17:17;17:17;"style."
17:17;17:20;"I mean, he's like, you know, kind of oblique and poetic and"
17:20;17:22;"you know, not negative."
17:22;17:24;"I mean, honestly to me, I would like higher and pavement aren't"
17:24;17:27;"that far apart, especially got it."
17:27;17:30;"But you got a content, but also you you know me well and you"
17:30;17:33;"know, like my vibe, you got a picture like when our first"
17:33;17:37;"album came out people here in like m79 and there was a"
17:37;17:39;"certain type of listener who would have been like whatever"
17:39;17:42;"good like pavement, right?"
17:42;17:43;"They come on your dunk at the gun."
17:43;17:44;"Yeah, Oxford."
17:44;17:48;"Although is pretty pavement who gives a fuck about an oxford"
17:48;17:52;"comma, but even then it's like more pop than pavement a little"
17:52;17:55;"bit but it's like I think it's like could be a pavement beside"
17:55;17:56;"a weirdo world."
17:56;17:59;"I think one of the most true like classic indie rock Vampire"
17:59;17:59;"Weekend songs."
17:59;18:01;"Yeah, because we were playing this the other day at the"
18:01;18:02;"rehearsal space."
18:02;18:06;"Yeah is a deep cut rarity called Ottoman."
18:06;18:07;"Is that one?"
18:07;18:07;"Wait, how does it go?"
18:07;18:08;"Wait, put it on."
18:08;18:11;"I think it's finally on the streaming services now because"
18:11;18:14;"this is like I wrote the riff when I was a teenager."
18:14;18:17;"I was thinking about it and look in the end the arrangement"
18:17;18:19;"went to like a very early Vampire Weekend place, but"
18:19;18:22;"there's the opening guitar riff which like I think I wrote"
18:22;18:23;"when I was like 14 or 15."
18:23;18:25;"Oh you go back that far."
18:25;18:29;"But then I like palm muted and stuff."
18:29;18:32;"You remember risks from when you wrote like when you were"
18:32;18:33;"14."
18:35;18:37;"Then once the cello comes in doesn't sound like pavement"
18:37;18:39;"anymore, but like just like"
18:39;18:44;"imagine if it wasn't palm muted."
18:44;18:48;"Baby,"
18:48;18:52;"I saw your girlfriend and she did"
18:52;18:55;"and the song line and then"
18:55;18:57;"at the Chancellor's Regatta"
18:58;18:59;"Parliament Street."
18:59;19:20;"Yeah, now the whole presentation."
19:20;19:23;"So on 90s indie rock, but"
19:23;19:27;"but just picture down down down down down down down down"
19:27;19:30;"down down down down down down down down down down down down"
19:30;19:32;"thrown shady Lane"
19:32;19:36;"blind date with a wait what blind date with the Chancellor"
19:36;19:40;"we had oysters and dry Lancers and the check when it arrived"
19:40;19:45;"we went Dutch Dutch Dutch Dutch a redder shade of neck on a"
19:45;19:51;"whiter shade of trash and this emery board is giving me a rash"
19:51;19:52;"I'm"
19:52;19:54;"flat out"
19:55;20:03;"beautiful to look at when you cry freeze don't move."
20:03;20:05;"You've been chosen."
20:05;20:06;"Absent"
20:06;20:09;"movie"
20:09;20:12;"adaptation"
20:12;20:14;"sequel"
20:14;20:17;"shady Lane"
20:17;20:20;"everybody wants one"
20:20;20:21;"a shady Lane"
20:21;20:24;"everybody needs one."
20:24;20:25;"Oh my God."
20:25;20:26;"Oh my God."
20:27;20:28;"Oh my God."
20:28;20:29;"Oh my God."
20:29;20:31;"Oh your God."
20:31;20:32;"Oh, he's got over."
20:32;20:33;"God."
20:33;20:35;"It's everybody's got to everybody's got to"
20:35;20:39;"everybody's got to everybody's got to love to lie."
20:39;20:40;"But all the"
20:40;20:46;"I like the"
20:46;20:49;"let me go full circle here."
20:49;20:49;"Yeah, wait."
20:49;20:51;"No, because I'm you know, I've always thought there was a"
20:51;20:53;"pavement vampire weekend connection"
20:53;20:55;"more sort of in like the lyrics."
20:55;20:58;"I could see that not so much in like the guitar playing but"
20:58;21:01;"sort of like the songwriting and the lyrics but going back"
21:01;21:04;"20 years ago when I was like huge pavement head when they"
21:04;21:07;"were still a band you given Stephen Malcom as your name."
21:07;21:08;"Yeah, exactly."
21:08;21:09;"It's like a weird thing."
21:09;21:12;"So I always thought there was a connection between pavement"
21:12;21:13;"and the dead."
21:13;21:14;"Oh, right."
21:14;21:17;"I've heard you says and that was a very controversial"
21:17;21:21;"opinion to have circa 1997 because in like indie rock"
21:21;21:25;"circles when I was like 20 the dead were just like sacrilegious"
21:25;21:28;"the dead were off limits uncool and I grew up with the dead"
21:28;21:29;"because my parents like the dead."
21:29;21:31;"I always loved the dead but I was like there's not there's"
21:31;21:35;"like a lot of crossover with the guitar playing and even"
21:35;21:39;"like the vocal affectation of Jerry and Stephen Malcom is"
21:39;21:44;"pretty nasally pretty like dry and straightforward and"
21:44;21:47;"yeah, unaffected sometimes Robert Hunters lyrics could"
21:47;21:50;"have that same kind of mix of storytelling and just like"
21:50;21:51;"straight-up surrealism."
21:51;21:52;"Yeah."
21:52;21:53;"Yeah, totally."
21:53;21:56;"I remember people just being like are you crazy and then"
21:56;21:59;"I remember going to a Stephen Malcom a very very early"
21:59;22:03;"Malcolmist and the Jicks show secret show in Portland circa"
22:03;22:07;"like 99 like Rapture pavement broke up and it was tiny shows"
22:07;22:09;"like maybe like 50 people there."
22:09;22:09;"Yeah."
22:09;22:12;"So after the show I was like, yo Steve always always wondered"
22:12;22:12;"dude."
22:12;22:14;"Are you into the dead?"
22:14;22:16;"He's like backing up his guitar."
22:16;22:16;"Yeah."
22:16;22:18;"He was just like chillin like just like having a beer at"
22:18;22:18;"the bar."
22:18;22:21;"Yeah, and I was like I was kind of nervous because I was"
22:21;22:24;"a huge pavement fan, but I was like Steve got to ask."
22:24;22:28;"Yeah deadhead and he was like he played it."
22:28;22:29;"I don't know."
22:29;22:31;"He's like, yeah, I don't know."
22:31;22:35;"I mean, I like some of the songs I like boxer rain like"
22:35;22:35;"like that."
22:35;22:37;"He kind of like wasn't like weighing in one way or the"
22:37;22:40;"other but then smash cut 10 years later."
22:40;22:42;"The Jicks are covering China China cat."
22:42;22:45;"Yeah, that's how it works things go in and out of fashion"
22:45;22:48;"and right and also as things age their differences become"
22:48;22:51;"lessened right?"
22:51;22:54;"Yeah, like imagine some kid who doesn't even listen to rock"
22:54;22:57;"music now and they hear you talking about the contentious"
22:57;23:01;"debates about the dead and indie rock circles in 97."
23:01;23:02;"They're just like right."
23:02;23:05;"It's all a bunch of old guitar man, right?"
23:05;23:12;"Look for a while at the China cat sunflower pow walking"
23:12;23:15;"jingle in the midnight sun."
23:15;23:19;"Cop with a board drop soon."
23:19;23:24;"Look him on the like a crazy quick start down through a"
23:24;23:25;"tree night."
23:25;23:29;"Isra Canings time crisis."
23:29;23:32;"Anyway, I don't know how I got down this whole boy."
23:32;23:33;"I was talking about my favorite Italian candy, which is"
23:33;23:35;"tick-tock."
23:35;23:39;"Oh, it's because we start talking about Facebook and"
23:39;23:42;"so we got into a pavement."
23:42;23:43;"I got in a pavement."
23:43;23:44;"So anyway, tic-tacs."
23:44;23:46;"I didn't realize this because you know, it's funny."
23:46;23:48;"I would have guessed that tic-tacs is owned by like"
23:48;23:49;"Procter & Gamble or something."
23:49;23:50;"Mm-hmm."
23:50;23:53;"When you think about it, it is a dainty little candy."
23:53;23:56;"It does have a kind of European sensibility."
23:56;23:57;"Hmm."
23:57;24:00;"It's not crazy to think about and so they were brought out"
24:00;24:03;"in 1969 by the Italian company Ferrero."
24:03;24:04;"That's tight."
24:04;24:06;"They were originally called refreshing mints."
24:06;24:08;"I guess they eventually changed the name refreshing"
24:08;24:11;"mints to tic-tacs and the tic-tac referred to the sound"
24:11;24:13;"that the container makes when open and close."
24:13;24:14;"Okay."
24:14;24:17;"So anyway, I didn't know until today that tic-tacs were"
24:17;24:20;"Italian which makes me like them more but the thing that"
24:20;24:23;"I learned about them on social media made me like them"
24:23;24:25;"less and I can't remember exactly where I saw this but"
24:25;24:27;"it was in some meme or something."
24:27;24:31;"So tic-tacs, I don't think the box actually says sugar-free"
24:31;24:34;"but very prominently on a box of tic-tacs."
24:34;24:39;"It says zero calories per serving and it says zero grams"
24:39;24:43;"of sugar per serving implying that tic-tacs are sugar-free."
24:43;24:43;"Right."
24:43;24:45;"And this is the thing about tic-tacs."
24:45;24:49;"There's nothing remotely sugar-free or non-caloric about"
24:49;24:49;"tic-tacs."
24:49;24:54;"This is a fully cooked up fiction where because tic-tacs"
24:54;24:58;"is taking full advantage of loopholes in the FDA's way"
24:58;24:59;"of labeling things."
24:59;25:02;"So tic-tacs can really be out there calling themselves"
25:02;25:07;"a zero calorie, zero sugar item and then you look at it."
25:07;25:10;"The number one ingredient of tic-tacs is sugar."
25:10;25:14;"Of course tic-tacs are full of sugar and this is what it"
25:14;25:16;"says on the tic-tacs website."
25:16;25:18;"If you go to the it frequently asked questions on the tic-tac"
25:18;25:20;"websites. Cool part of the website."
25:20;25:22;"Yeah, they know nobody's going there."
25:22;25:25;"Tic-tac mints do contain sugar as listed in the ingredient"
25:25;25:26;"statement."
25:26;25:29;"However, since the amount of sugar per serving one mint."
25:29;25:30;"Yeah."
25:30;25:33;"So by the way, the serving size of tic-tacs is one mint."
25:33;25:34;"That's whack."
25:34;25:36;"Yeah, I've never had one tic-tac in my life."
25:36;25:39;"It's even very difficult to simply serve yourself one tic-tac."
25:39;25:40;"Yeah."
25:40;25:43;"However, since the amount of sugar per serving one mint is"
25:43;25:47;"less than 0.5 grams FDA labeling requirements permit the"
25:47;25:50;"nutrition facts to state that there are zero grams of sugar"
25:50;25:50;"per serving."
25:50;25:53;"So basically if a serving size of something has less than"
25:53;25:57;"0.5 grams of sugar, you're allowed to just round it down"
25:57;26:00;"to zero that shouldn't be a rule to begin with and here's"
26:00;26:01;"the amazing part."
26:01;26:05;"It doesn't even matter how much sugar there is relative to"
26:05;26:06;"the size of the portion."
26:06;26:12;"So understandably if you were selling like a foot-long sandwich"
26:12;26:15;"that somehow had 0.5 grams of sugar and you're like FDA come"
26:15;26:19;"on. We're saying we're giving people a big-ass sandwich that"
26:19;26:20;"basically has no sugar right?"
26:20;26:21;"Can we just call it zero sugar?"
26:21;26:23;"Maybe that even that doesn't make that much sense."
26:23;26:27;"But tic-tacs solely because the serving size is so small."
26:27;26:30;"They can lie through their teeth and say that there's zero"
26:30;26:32;"grams of sugar per serving."
26:32;26:33;"It's crazy."
26:33;26:34;"Why is that even a rule?"
26:34;26:35;"That's bonkers."
26:35;26:38;"I mean, I'm sure if you're like diabetic or something where"
26:38;26:39;"you really have to watch your sugar."
26:39;26:41;"You've learned this lesson a long time ago, but it's just"
26:41;26:42;"it's just wacky."
26:42;26:46;"That's a funny thing about like companies being sketchy with"
26:46;26:49;"really really underestimating the serving size."
26:49;26:50;"Right."
26:50;26:50;"Very misleading."
26:50;26:52;"All these nutrition facts."
26:52;26:53;"They just confuse people."
26:53;26:55;"People you're better off just saying I'm not gonna have any"
26:55;26:58;"sugar or like carbs for a while rather than like finding all"
26:58;27:01;"these like misleading things where it's like, well, there is"
27:01;27:03;"some sugar but it's very high in protein."
27:03;27:04;"Making you do the math."
27:05;27:07;"One in the head, one in the back, bubbling."
27:07;27:09;"Look at the cash."
27:09;27:10;"Look at the cash coming in."
27:10;27:12;"Come get your mess."
27:12;27:13;"Little booker bugging me."
27:13;27:16;"Just need a bag, quit all that jaw-jackery."
27:16;27:18;"Don't even pass me that."
27:18;27:19;"I don't want none of it."
27:19;27:21;"He's freaking mad about it."
27:21;27:22;"Had enough of it."
27:22;27:24;"Whoa, watch what you're saying."
27:24;27:25;"How that popping and shaking."
27:25;27:27;"Got me hot as a laser."
27:27;27:28;"My popsie dipping, irating."
27:28;27:30;"We act a fool for the paper."
27:30;27:31;"Had a dream and I made it."
27:31;27:33;"Del Camino on date us."
27:33;27:34;"Bitches, guess overbaked."
27:34;27:36;"Put the bread on me."
27:36;27:38;"Put the bed on my blanket."
27:38;27:39;"Big and flat in the blanket."
27:39;27:40;"I might just roll out today."
27:40;27:42;"I might just roll out to Vegas."
27:42;27:43;"Head back to my old ways."
27:43;27:45;"Copper roof on that."
27:45;27:47;"All day."
27:47;27:48;"Look at me, baby."
27:50;27:51;"Don't I look like a million?"
27:51;27:52;"I'm 'bout to clean out the safe."
27:52;27:56;"Don't I look like somebody that just be bodying everything?"
27:56;27:58;"All that talking is great, but I don't be talking."
27:58;27:59;"I air it out."
27:59;28:01;"All the problems have gotten easy to bury."
28:01;28:03;"I'd rather drown them in Hendrix."
28:03;28:04;"I'd rather kiss on my Mary."
28:04;28:06;"I been broke away longer than I've been rich."
28:06;28:11;"So until it levels out, I'ma take your mama to the Marriott and belly flop."
28:11;28:15;"So I was pretty negative on Tic Tacs once I found out that they were cooking the books like this."
28:15;28:16;"It's just sketchy."
28:16;28:17;"Wait, what's this Trump stuff here?"
28:17;28:24;"Well, remember that when Trump was saying all those horrible things on the Access Hollywood bus, the infamous tape."
28:24;28:25;"Yeah."
28:25;28:27;"He was talking about needing Tic Tacs."
28:27;28:31;"He was talking with the guy on the bus about Tic Tacs."
28:31;28:31;"Yeah."
28:32;28:35;"Which I guess was related to his like seducing women or something."
28:35;28:36;"He needs to have that breath."
28:36;28:37;"He needed a good breath."
28:37;28:47;"And then Tic Tac denounced the candidate Trump and they tweeted Tic Tac, not Tic Tacs, Tic Tac respects all women."
28:47;28:48;"No, you don't."
28:48;28:50;"First of all, no, you don't."
28:50;28:50;"I love this."
28:50;28:56;"This inanimate object, aka candy, respects all women."
28:56;29:00;"You don't respect women enough to keep it real with them about how much sugar is in your product."
29:00;29:06;"Oh, we find the recent statements and behavior completely inappropriate and unacceptable."
29:06;29:08;"Tic Tac, you're 100% right."
29:08;29:10;"Donald Trump's statements are completely inappropriate and unacceptable."
29:10;29:19;"As far as the behavior of a human being goes, as far as the behavior of a candy, we ask very little of you, arguably much less than we ask of a human being."
29:19;29:21;"Just be straightforward."
29:21;29:23;"Just be straightforward about your ingredients."
29:23;29:25;"Yeah, that's all we ask."
29:25;29:27;"There's the cognitive dissonance."
29:27;29:32;"Number one ingredient, sugar, amount of sugar per serving, zero grams in same."
29:32;29:33;"Why don't they say 0.5 grams?"
29:33;29:35;"Because the FDA doesn't make them."
29:35;29:37;"You give them an inch."
29:37;29:42;"Tic Tac, if you're listening, because we know you're such a strong advocate of women."
29:42;29:45;"The Ferraro Corporation, if you're listening."
29:45;29:55;"Well, I don't know how the Ferraro Corporation feels, but I know that Tic Tac got on Twitter and was willing to speak truth to power to our sexist piece of s*** president."
29:55;30:01;"So, oh God, imagine if like Trump off the back of that, the way that he got elected was like, everybody was like, whoa, even Tic Tac's coming for Trump."
30:01;30:02;"How's he?"
30:02;30:03;"And that was a feeling."
30:03;30:03;"He's saying this."
30:03;30:07;"He's basically admitting to sexual assault and people like he's not going to get out of this one."
30:07;30:08;"Remember?"
30:08;30:10;"And then the way he got out, he got out."
30:10;30:15;"You know, I got Tic Tac coming for me talking about they respect women."
30:15;30:17;"These lying crooks."
30:17;30:20;"They're talking about, they're talking about it being zero grams of sugar."
30:20;30:21;"Do you believe this?"
30:22;30:24;"Even what is it with these people and their numbers?"
30:24;30:25;"Can you imagine?"
30:25;30:27;"Like on the debate stage with Hillary."
30:27;30:29;"That's some crooked Tic Tac."
30:29;30:35;"Hillary listening to Trump talk about the serving sides of Tic Tacs, just like stone faced."
30:35;30:36;"God."
30:36;30:37;"But you know what?"
30:37;30:37;"I do."
30:37;30:40;"I think they do make sugar free Tic Tacs."
30:40;30:41;"That's the hilarious part."
30:41;30:42;"Diet."
30:42;30:44;"Yeah, there's sugar free Tic Tacs."
30:44;30:49;"I just want to like go into like a CVS and be like, sir, do you have like sugar free Tic Tacs?"
30:49;30:50;"Like, oh yeah, right there."
30:50;30:52;"Be like, what's the difference?"
30:53;30:57;"I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the health information on the back."
30:57;31:00;"They both seem to have zero grams of sugar."
31:00;31:00;"Yeah."
31:00;31:03;"Does the CVS manager get that granular?"
31:03;31:04;"It occurs."
31:04;31:06;"Knowledge of the products."
31:06;31:10;"It occurs to me that if a product has zero grams of sugar, it is in fact sugar free."
31:10;31:15;"Hence the idea of there being a sugar free Tic Tac makes no sense at all."
31:15;31:19;"Riddle me this, sir."
31:19;31:20;"Anyway, boy."
31:20;31:21;"Security."
31:22;31:24;"Anyway, should we boycott Tic Tacs?"
31:24;31:25;"I don't eat them."
31:25;31:26;"I'm an Altoids guy."
31:26;31:28;"Interesting."
31:28;31:29;"Altoids have sugar."
31:29;31:31;"Yeah, I'm not worried about it."
31:31;31:33;"I'm not scarfing handfuls of Altoids."
31:33;31:35;"One at a time."
31:35;31:37;"I'm doing like two, three a day."
31:37;31:39;"Don't you find they're not powerful enough though?"
31:39;31:42;"No, it's very kind of dull."
31:42;31:46;"I thought the whole thing Altoids were billed as being the curiously strong men."
31:46;31:48;"Tic Tac is comparatively weak."
31:48;31:50;"What am I thinking of then?"
31:50;31:52;"Well, Mentos is not very strong."
31:52;31:53;"Yeah, you're right."
31:53;32:00;"It's funny how like Altoids, I guess they are originally English and they always had this kind of upper crust sensibility."
32:00;32:00;"I love the tin."
32:00;32:01;"I gotta tell you."
32:01;32:06;"The tin is nice and I feel like they really tried to brand it on some like Harry Potter s***."
32:06;32:12;"Like there's always like an English person like Altoids, curiously, curiously strong men."
32:12;32:16;"I think that Tic Tacs now is neither here nor there."
32:16;32:19;"Do you stand for women or are you lying to them?"
32:20;32:22;"And their other gendered counterparts."
32:22;32:28;"I think if Altoids is like the English one, Mentos always came across as kind of like East Block."
32:28;32:30;"Right."
32:30;32:31;"Czech Republic vibe."
32:31;32:34;"I think Tic Tac should get back to their Italian heritage."
32:34;32:35;"That'd be cool."
32:35;32:37;"What is the most popular mint in America?"
32:37;32:39;"Seinfeld, can I get a number crunch?"
32:39;32:39;"Coming up."
32:39;32:41;"You want to guess?"
32:41;32:41;"Should I just tell you?"
32:41;32:43;"Um, okay, let's guess."
32:43;32:44;"Is it not Tic Tac?"
32:44;32:45;"It's not Tic Tac."
32:45;32:47;"And it's not Altoids."
32:47;32:47;"It is Altoids."
32:47;32:48;"Okay."
32:48;32:48;"Oh, really?"
32:48;32:50;"Altoids are more popular than Tic Tacs?"
32:50;32:51;"I'm surprised too."
32:51;32:52;"I guess because they keep it real."
32:52;32:53;"By hair."
32:53;32:54;"They're straightforward."
32:54;32:54;"Oh, by how much?"
32:54;32:57;"By, uh, looks like about 1%."
32:57;32:59;"Oh, so they're tied for first, basically."
32:59;32:59;"Number three."
32:59;33:01;"I'm actually surprised by that."
33:01;33:01;"What's number three?"
33:01;33:03;"I don't think you're going to guess this one."
33:03;33:04;"It's Ice Breakers."
33:04;33:05;"That's not gum?"
33:05;33:08;"It's kind of a gum hybrid, I would say."
33:08;33:11;"I feel like it's somewhere between Altoids and Mentos."
33:11;33:12;"But how do you hybridize that?"
33:12;33:12;"I mean,"
33:12;33:13;"Neither of those are gum."
33:13;33:17;"I mean, you chew and you swallow a gum you spit out."
33:17;33:18;"Although Mentos makes gum."
33:18;33:20;"Isn't that, have you ever had Mentos gum?"
33:20;33:24;"It's so confusing because the original Mentos is so close"
33:24;33:25;"to being a gum."
33:25;33:26;"This show."

34:43;34:44;"I like this."
34:44;34:46;"So we should do another mints episode."
34:46;34:48;"Anyway, we're about to get on the phone."
34:48;34:49;"How do you think you pronounce his name?"
34:49;34:51;"Phil Matarese or Phil Matarese?"
34:51;34:53;"- I would say the second one, but yeah, we should ask him."
34:53;34:57;"- It's Phil, M-A-T-A-R-E-S-E."
34:57;35:01;"Phil Matarese is the creator and star of Animals on HBO."
35:01;35:03;"It's a funny cartoon on HBO."
35:03;35:04;"New season starts August 3rd."
35:04;35:07;"And he also makes music under the name Phil's Pills."
35:07;35:08;"And he's a lifelong chips lover"
35:08;35:10;"with a concentration on Doritos."
35:10;35:12;"Seinfeld 2000 got in touch with him"
35:12;35:14;"because he wrote a little chain,"
35:14;35:17;"a little thread on Doritos."
35:17;35:19;"And you can tell this guy's a real Doritos head."
35:19;35:23;"And he's also a media industry professional."
35:23;35:25;"This is what he wrote on Twitter."
35:25;35:26;"I try not to be too serious on here,"
35:26;35:28;"but something has been happening over the past year lately"
35:28;35:31;"that I find deeply, deeply troubling."
35:31;35:34;"Doritos Blaze was released January 2018."
35:34;35:36;"Now I didn't even know about this."
35:36;35:38;"Did you know that they dropped a new Doritos this year?"
35:38;35:39;"- Nope, out of the loop."
35:39;35:40;"- Recently on Time Crisis,"
35:40;35:42;"we've been less interested in Doritos."
35:42;35:44;"We've been focusing more on mints, Tic Tacs, Altoids,"
35:44;35:45;"things of that nature."
35:45;35:46;"So we've been slacking."
35:46;35:49;"So anyway, Doritos dropped something called Blaze"
35:49;35:51;"in January 2018."
35:51;35:53;"And according to Phil, it is a bull (beep)"
35:53;35:55;"redundant Dorito."
35:55;35:56;"It's got no point of view."
35:56;36:00;"And is, in my opinion, spicy for spicy's sake."
36:00;36:03;"The original Rollout's bag heat marks hands on it,"
36:03;36:05;"which is so, so lame, but here's why this matters."
36:05;36:06;"So look at this, Jake."
36:06;36:08;"This is the bag of Blaze,"
36:08;36:11;"and it has almost like these red hot fingers on it."
36:11;36:12;"- Uh-huh, I'm seeing it."
36:12;36:16;"- As if even gripping the bag would cause like fire, lava."
36:16;36:17;"- You know what it reminds me of"
36:17;36:20;"is the Coors Light Super Cold Can."
36:20;36:21;"- Yeah."
36:21;36:24;"- Where there's like some sort of weird like thermal reading"
36:24;36:26;"where like if it's super cold, like it--"
36:26;36:27;"- Oh, the mountains change colors?"
36:27;36:30;"- Yeah, like it goes to like blue or something."
36:30;36:31;"Just real whack."
36:31;36:34;"- And so the reason that Phil's so upset about this"
36:34;36:35;"is the Doritos brand has cannibalized"
36:35;36:38;"one of their most beloved flavors, sweet chili spice."
36:38;36:41;"So even then, I'm like, this guy's a super Doritos head."
36:41;36:45;"Because to even call sweet chili spicy--"
36:45;36:46;"- A classic."
36:46;36:48;"- Yeah, to me the classics are--"
36:48;36:49;"- Nacho cheese."
36:49;36:50;"- Nacho cheese and ranch."
36:50;36:51;"- Yeah, that's it."
36:51;36:53;"- Democrats and Republicans, man."
36:53;36:56;"Binary, but Phil clearly, he's a third party guy."
36:56;36:58;"On my walk today, I stopped by three stores"
36:58;36:59;"and none of them had it."
36:59;37:02;"Two had Blaze, and that's not okay, 'cause it's my favorite."
37:02;37:05;"So basically, this new one Blaze is supplanting his favorite."
37:05;37:07;"Blaze is now the third purple bag"
37:07;37:09;"on the Doritos primary roster."
37:09;37:11;"I'm very worried for the future SSC."
37:11;37:14;"Sweet spicy chili, here's what you can do to help."
37:14;37:17;"Don't buy Blaze and buy the shit out of sweet spicy chili."
37:17;37:21;"If you want spicy, go for Flama's, Tapatio,"
37:21;37:23;"or my second favorite, Salsa Verde."
37:23;37:25;"- You know what's so weird about this is in Canada,"
37:25;37:29;"sweet spicy chili is called sweet chili heat."
37:29;37:30;"- Really?"
37:30;37:31;"- Yeah."
37:31;37:32;"♪ Sweet chili heat ♪"
37:32;37:33;"- Seems like an arbitrary--"
37:33;37:35;"- Sweet chili."
37:35;37:37;"So anyway, we gotta get Phil on the phone."
37:37;37:39;"- I gotta write a song called Sweet Chili Heat."
37:39;37:41;"- Jake's making a note on his phone."

37:53;37:54;"- Yes, this is Phil."
37:54;37:55;"- Hey Phil, how you doing?"
37:55;37:57;"You're on Time Crisis with Ezra and Jake."
37:57;37:59;"- Hey Ezra, how's it going man?"
37:59;38:00;"Hey Jake, how's it going?"
38:00;38:01;"- Hey, what's up?"
38:01;38:02;"- Great to have you on the show, man."
38:02;38:04;"Fan of your work, fan of Animals."
38:04;38:06;"First question though,"
38:06;38:08;"did not know how to pronounce your last name."
38:08;38:10;"- Oh yeah, just flatten it out man, Mattarese."
38:10;38:13;"Not like too Italian or anything like that, just Mattarese."
38:13;38:15;"- Okay, 'cause I was saying it real Italian before."
38:15;38:16;"All right, Phil Mattarese."
38:16;38:17;"- You're with the flirters."
38:17;38:18;"How do you say your last name?"
38:18;38:19;"- That's a good question."
38:19;38:22;"My family actually says Canig,"
38:22;38:23;"but everybody always says Konig,"
38:23;38:24;"so we kind of like gave up."
38:24;38:27;"(laughing)"
38:27;38:29;"I was basically raised not to correct people,"
38:29;38:30;"'cause they're always like,"
38:30;38:32;"none of these are the real pronunciations."
38:32;38:32;"Maybe you feel the same way."
38:32;38:35;"It's like in the homeland, they pronounce it differently."
38:35;38:37;"- It's a mess, the surnames are a mess."
38:37;38:39;"Dave, what's your last name?"
38:39;38:40;"- Longstreth."
38:40;38:42;"- Oh yeah, Longstreth, Phil."
38:42;38:43;"That's easy."
38:43;38:44;"- Yeah, nobody's getting that wrong."
38:44;38:46;"- People do, they say Longstretch."
38:46;38:47;"- Oh yeah, that's true."
38:47;38:49;"- That happens all the time."
38:49;38:50;"- Pete, are you on Twitter there, brother?"
38:50;38:52;"I'm probably gonna see you guys in LA."
38:52;38:56;"- I'm not, but I'll be at the LA shows in attendance."
38:56;38:57;"- You guys can have a beer together."
38:57;38:59;"So Phil, we were just reading through"
38:59;39:02;"some of your Doritos tweets."
39:02;39:04;"So Jake and I would love to talk about Doritos,"
39:04;39:08;"but we gotta admit that you seem like a true Doritos head,"
39:08;39:13;"because you refer to spicy sweet chili"
39:13;39:15;"as a beloved Doritos flavor."
39:15;39:17;"That's barely even on our radar, man."
39:17;39:20;"So have you just always been a huge Doritos fan or what?"
39:20;39:24;"- Yeah, it's pretty ingrained in who I am."
39:24;39:28;"I have a very early distinct memory of my grandma"
39:28;39:32;"introducing me to Cool Ranch Doritos"
39:32;39:34;"and literally thinking like,"
39:34;39:35;"my grandma's like pretty (beep) cool."
39:35;39:38;"I didn't know this, but my grandma is pretty (beep) cool."
39:38;39:40;"She's got the hook up with some crazy (beep)."
39:40;39:43;"So it's like deep seated into me."
39:43;39:48;"Personally, I think chips are like the best food,"
39:48;39:51;"and I think Doritos are the best version of the best food."
39:51;39:55;"So I'm like, I'm kind of a nut job about Doritos, yes."
39:55;39:58;"- And so you have Doritos in your home, your abode?"
39:58;39:59;"- You know what, gang?"
39:59;40:01;"I try not to keep them in there,"
40:01;40:03;"'cause once I get the big bags,"
40:03;40:06;"I usually just eat the whole thing, or I come close to it."
40:06;40:08;"I'm like a dog with dog food"
40:08;40:11;"where I'll just keep eating until I get sick."
40:11;40:13;"So what I like to do is I like to like,"
40:13;40:15;"you know, if I'm out and about,"
40:15;40:16;"if I'm getting gas or something,"
40:16;40:18;"I'll go on in, I'll get a smaller bag."
40:18;40:20;"Probably not as good for the environment"
40:20;40:22;"'cause I'm using more packaging,"
40:22;40:23;"but you gotta do what you gotta do, gang."
40:23;40:25;"- And your favorite flavor is,"
40:25;40:27;"see, I'm confused about this,"
40:27;40:29;"'cause some of the bags say spicy sweet chili,"
40:29;40:32;"but you also called it sweet chili spice."
40:32;40:34;"What is it?"
40:34;40:35;"- I probably just got it wrong."
40:35;40:37;"I'll be honest, it's kind of a clunky name."
40:37;40:39;"It is spicy sweet chili."
40:39;40:42;"- Seinfeld 2000 is telling us in Canada,"
40:42;40:43;"where he comes from, what's it called?"
40:43;40:45;"- Sweet chili heat."
40:45;40:48;"♪ Sweet, sweet chili heat ♪"
40:48;40:49;"We just wrote a song."
40:49;40:51;"It seems like an arbitrary change"
40:51;40:52;"on that title for the Canadian market,"
40:52;40:53;"but there you have it."
40:53;40:56;"- See, I'm starting to see some problems already"
40:56;40:58;"with my favorite flavor."
40:58;41:00;"It's that it's like up north,"
41:00;41:01;"we're getting a different name."
41:01;41:03;"We can't get the name right here in America."
41:03;41:06;"- Gang, what's your take on Doritos?"
41:06;41:07;"Where do you guys stand?"
41:07;41:08;"So I'm guessing you're probably"
41:08;41:10;"in the nacho cheese, Cool Ranch world."
41:10;41:11;"- Exactly."
41:11;41:13;"Jake and I are kind of meat and potatoes, guys."
41:13;41:16;"Those are the two that we're familiar with."
41:16;41:19;"Everything beyond that, I consider like a novelty."
41:19;41:21;"Like Doritos 3D?"
41:21;41:21;"What was that?"
41:21;41:24;"- That's one-off sort of stuff."
41:24;41:26;"They do that kind of stuff here and there,"
41:26;41:30;"but spicy sweet chili, that was a primary roster."
41:30;41:34;"I would say salsa verde is a primary roster,"
41:34;41:37;"as well as probably spicy nacho."
41:37;41:39;"That would be like, you go to like any-"
41:39;41:43;"- Wait, so wait, how big is the primary roster?"
41:43;41:46;"Like if I go into this like a Vons"
41:46;41:48;"or like an Arco gas station?"
41:48;41:50;"- That's an issue I'm having right now"
41:50;41:51;"with my favorite flavor."
41:51;41:52;"We'll get to that in a moment."
41:52;41:55;"But I think about four, I would say."
41:55;41:59;"So Doritos, Cool Ranch, always gonna be everywhere,"
41:59;42:00;"basically no matter where you go."
42:00;42:03;"After that, my personal experience,"
42:03;42:06;"even having have moved from New Jersey,"
42:06;42:10;"Pennsylvania, New York to out here in Los Angeles,"
42:10;42:12;"I've been able to get spicy sweet chili"
42:12;42:15;"pretty regularly at gas stations,"
42:15;42:19;"your Wawa's, your food stores, as well as spicy nacho."
42:19;42:22;"So I guess those would be my primary roster."
42:22;42:23;"That's the top four."
42:23;42:25;"- And it sounds like you're like spicy."
42:25;42:27;"- Yeah, I do."
42:27;42:29;"But I have a limit and I'll tell you what,"
42:29;42:32;"this new mother (beep) that came out of the gate, Blaze,"
42:32;42:34;"is too spicy."
42:34;42:39;"It's knocking spicy sweet chili off of the primary roster."
42:39;42:40;"That's my big issue."
42:40;42:42;"That's what I keep griping about online."
42:42;42:44;"It tastes like nothing, just spicy for spicy sake."
42:44;42:47;"It's vague, uncharacteristic flavor."
42:47;42:49;"And it's a purple bag."
42:49;42:51;"So I know that sounds silly,"
42:51;42:54;"but this is now the third Doritos purple bag"
42:54;42:57;"that's in production right now."
42:57;42:58;"Number one being spicy sweet chili,"
42:58;43:03;"number two being the tasty and very spicy flamas,"
43:03;43:04;"and number three being this mother (beep) Blaze"
43:04;43:05;"that came out of nowhere."
43:05;43:08;"And I live in a pretty foot traffic-y area"
43:08;43:10;"of Los Angeles, Echo Parks,"
43:10;43:14;"and I've been able to get spicy sweet chili"
43:14;43:19;"pretty regularly from varying corporate levels"
43:19;43:22;"of like a 7-Eleven, a liquor store near me,"
43:22;43:26;"an AM/PM, and then just like a small little bodega thing."
43:26;43:29;"And four out of five places near my house, guys,"
43:29;43:32;"have Blaze, but none of them carry"
43:32;43:34;"spicy sweet chili anymore."
43:34;43:34;"- That's wild."
43:34;43:35;"I wonder how this works."
43:35;43:38;"Like maybe on some very straight-up level,"
43:38;43:41;"the local Doritos distributor is going to these stores"
43:41;43:44;"and saying, ""Listen, we're trying to push Blaze right now,"
43:44;43:46;"""so tailor your orders around it."
43:46;43:49;"""If you take three bags of Blaze, we'll give you a discount."""
43:49;43:53;"You know, like maybe there truly is a top-down directive"
43:53;43:56;"to kind of phase out SSC and move in Blaze."
43:56;43:57;"- Oh, I bet there is."
43:57;44:00;"(hip hop music)"
44:05;44:31;"- It's interesting too, the way you're talking about Blaze,"
44:31;44:34;"'cause the first thing that came to mind is like,"
44:34;44:37;"you're somebody who likes spicy Doritos,"
44:37;44:39;"so already you're a little bit left of center."
44:39;44:42;"You're not like a down-the-middle kind of guy,"
44:42;44:44;"not a nacho cheese Cool Ranch guy."
44:44;44:47;"And then something comes out that is even further"
44:47;44:48;"to the left of what you like."
44:48;44:49;"It's beyond the pale."
44:49;44:52;"It makes me think a little bit about like the directors"
44:52;44:54;"and the fans who were into like kind of classic"
44:54;44:58;"horror movies, which in the '80s seemed so violent,"
44:58;45:01;"like ""Freddy,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" all that stuff."
45:01;45:03;"And then you get to the Saw era,"
45:03;45:05;"just like the torture movies,"
45:05;45:06;"and then suddenly you have a lot of people pushing back,"
45:06;45:09;"be like, ""This is not what the horror genre is all about."
45:09;45:11;"""This is just gross-out bull(beep)."""
45:11;45:12;"And then everybody's like,"
45:12;45:13;"""I thought this is what you wanted."""
45:13;45:14;"- Amen, brother."
45:14;45:15;"- And they're like, ""No, no, no."
45:15;45:18;"""Just because I like something a little bit violent"
45:18;45:21;"""on screen does not mean that I want it cranked to 200."""
45:21;45:23;"- Incredible analogy."
45:23;45:25;"- It really came to mind very strongly."
45:25;45:28;"- I'll tell you, I don't need the closeup of the nails"
45:28;45:30;"going into the eyeballs and all that sort of stuff,"
45:30;45:32;"and that's what this place is right now."
45:32;45:33;"It's giving me a headache."
45:33;45:37;"It is a nail in my friggin' eyeball."
45:37;45:38;"- We don't need that."
45:38;45:39;"- I don't need that, man."
45:39;45:41;"I got too much stuff going on right now, man."
45:41;45:45;"To actually notice something that I like going away,"
45:45;45:48;"you know, there's like a quote about authoritarianism"
45:48;45:50;"that you should write things down"
45:50;45:52;"that are suddenly changing around you."
45:52;45:53;"- Oh, right, when Trump came to office,"
45:53;45:54;"everybody was saying that."
45:54;45:56;"- Yeah, yeah, basically, yeah, all that."
45:56;45:58;"There was like, someone's writing a book, basically,"
45:58;46:00;"of all the changes that have happened."
46:00;46:02;"- To do that on a very small level,"
46:02;46:05;"but for a bag of chips that I love,"
46:05;46:07;"and keep being replaced with like,"
46:07;46:10;"and some of these Blaze bags have like,"
46:10;46:13;"cheap hand marks on it, it's so corny."
46:13;46:15;"I'm getting all riled up about it."
46:15;46:17;"- I know like, it might seem like so crazy,"
46:17;46:19;"and obviously in the grand scheme of things,"
46:19;46:21;"compared to all these terrible things that are happening."
46:21;46:23;"It doesn't mean a lot, but--"
46:23;46:24;"- Well."
46:24;46:25;"- Well, I know, but I mean, it's interesting"
46:25;46:27;"to always look for the metaphors in our culture,"
46:27;46:29;"and Doritos are part of our culture."
46:29;46:30;"- I know what you mean, too, like,"
46:30;46:32;"there is something about like,"
46:32;46:36;"if spicy used to mean an alternate flavor on the spectrum"
46:36;46:39;"for people who wanted something with a little bit of kick,"
46:39;46:42;"and then they're giving something that essentially"
46:42;46:44;"is just to like, torture people,"
46:44;46:47;"people who are so numb to the sweet, spicy chilies"
46:47;46:49;"of the world, that they just want something"
46:49;46:51;"that just like, almost just hurts them."
46:51;46:53;"- It's like incest porn."
46:53;46:56;"(laughing)"
46:56;46:57;"- It's extremist."
46:57;46:59;"So in some weird way, it's like,"
46:59;47:00;"when things are pushed to an extreme,"
47:00;47:03;"it's like, yeah, what's going on in a country"
47:03;47:06;"where people need to like, hurt themselves?"
47:06;47:08;"- To feel anything."
47:08;47:09;"- Yeah, just to feel something."
47:09;47:12;"- And you think about like, the prevalence of sriracha, too."
47:12;47:14;"I remember the first time I had it,"
47:14;47:18;"whenever that was, maybe like 10 years ago now,"
47:18;47:20;"to me, it was so spicy."
47:20;47:23;"It was like the craziest thing to put on your food,"
47:23;47:26;"but now I almost like, treat it like ketchup."
47:26;47:28;"So maybe there is a slight, I don't know,"
47:28;47:30;"evolutionary-- - Shift, what not?"
47:30;47:31;"And you're right, like, if you're,"
47:31;47:34;"there's definitely like, places where just that."
47:34;47:36;"Some people grow up with spicy food and some people don't,"
47:36;47:40;"but it sounds like Blaze is going beyond"
47:40;47:44;"any kind of recorded culture that any anthropologist"
47:44;47:47;"has ever seen. - Blaze is amoral."
47:47;47:49;"- Yeah, Blaze is amoral."
47:49;47:49;"- I think it is."
47:49;47:53;"The chips themselves actually have way more seasoning"
47:53;47:54;"on it, too."
47:54;47:56;"You know, you look at like, a nacho cheese,"
47:56;47:57;"it's like a beautiful thing."
47:57;47:59;"You can see the tortilla under it, all that sort of stuff,"
47:59;48:02;"but this thing is like, it's a piece of sandpaper almost,"
48:02;48:05;"with the amount of seasoning left on it."
48:05;48:06;"- Just powder coat. - It's really"
48:06;48:07;"kind of grotesque."
48:07;48:09;"Yeah, it's strange."
48:09;48:11;"- I just want, I want to make a commercial"
48:11;48:13;"for Doritos Blaze, where that's just"
48:13;48:15;"the Johnny Cash Nine Inch Nails cover."
48:15;48:19;"♪ I hurt myself today ♪"
48:19;48:21;"♪ To see if I still ♪"
48:21;48:22;"All right, well, Phil, thanks so much for calling in."
48:22;48:24;"We hope you'll call in again, talk about Doritos."
48:24;48:26;"Real quick question, 'cause this has been"
48:26;48:28;"brewing on the show for a few months,"
48:28;48:30;"because the word chip connotes different things"
48:30;48:32;"to different people, I assume for you,"
48:32;48:34;"and the first chip you think of as Doritos"
48:34;48:36;"for other people might be a potato chip, like Lay's."
48:36;48:40;"If you were having a party, and you sent your friend out,"
48:40;48:41;"and they said, ""Can I go grab anything"
48:41;48:42;"""from the corner store?"""
48:42;48:44;"And you said, ""Sure, I've already got a bunch of beer,"
48:44;48:47;"""grab some chips,"" and they came back"
48:47;48:49;"with a whole bunch of Cheetos,"
48:49;48:51;"would you think that was weird?"
48:51;48:52;"- I would think that's weird."
48:52;48:54;"I wouldn't be too happy with that."
48:54;48:56;"It's too much of a swing in one direction."
48:56;48:59;"It's too niche of a thing, and you're not getting"
48:59;49:02;"the same mouth sensation as a chip"
49:02;49:06;"when you were asking for something as specific as a chip."
49:06;49:08;"You want a very specific crunch."
49:08;49:11;"- Right, it's not a chip, on a very basic level."
49:11;49:12;"They disobeyed the order."
49:12;49:16;"It's not a chip. - That is not a good friend."
49:16;49:18;"That is not a good friend, not a good listener, I think."
49:18;49:19;"- Yeah, I don't know why some people think,"
49:19;49:21;"and look, I love Cheetos."
49:21;49:23;"I have nothing against Cheetos, but it's just fun to,"
49:23;49:24;"that'd be like if you asked somebody"
49:24;49:25;"to go grab some chips, and they came back"
49:25;49:27;"with a big box of saltines."
49:27;49:28;"What's the difference?"
49:28;49:29;"Jake's shaking his head."
49:29;49:31;"He's still, why?"
49:31;49:31;"- No, that would drive me up a wall."
49:31;49:33;"- Oh, it would drive you up the wall."
49:33;49:34;"- What about Goldfish?"
49:34;49:37;"- Are Goldfish for children or adults?"
49:37;49:39;"- I think Goldfish are for children, frankly."
49:39;49:40;"I don't care for Goldfish."
49:40;49:43;"It gets all too gummed up in my teeth."
49:43;49:45;"You have like four, and all of a sudden,"
49:45;49:47;"it's just, it's kind of just a round."
49:47;49:48;"- Yeah, oh, you know what? - That's a great point."
49:48;49:49;"- You know what I just thought of?"
49:49;49:49;"- That's just a great point."
49:49;49:51;"- You know what I just thought of talking to Phil, too?"
49:51;49:52;"- It's very dry."
49:52;49:54;"- Is that, yeah, it's so dry."
49:54;49:55;"But another thought I just had talking to Phil,"
49:55;49:58;"'cause we talk about Goldfish all the time on this show."
49:58;49:59;"- It's a great show, Phil."
49:59;50:00;"- You know one, yeah."
50:00;50:01;"(laughing)"
50:01;50:03;"- I gotta get off the music, gang."
50:03;50:04;"- It's an excellent radio show."
50:04;50:06;"But you know how we really know"
50:06;50:09;"that Goldfish are for children?"
50:09;50:12;"Is because there's no Goldfish Blaze."
50:12;50:15;"There's no three-alarm-fire spicy Goldfish."
50:15;50:16;"- Well, they're keeping it classy."
50:16;50:17;"- 'Cause you would never, no,"
50:17;50:18;"it's 'cause you would never feed that to children."
50:18;50:20;"- No, Blaze is for children."
50:20;50:21;"- No."
50:21;50:22;"- Man children."
50:22;50:24;"- Okay, maybe for man children."
50:24;50:26;"But no, there's like Rainbow Goldfish."
50:26;50:29;"There's different types of Goldfish,"
50:29;50:34;"but there's no five-alarm, spicy, nacho, chili heat."
50:34;50:38;"- You're not gonna see that under the Pepperidge Farm banner."
50:38;50:39;"- Yeah, no, Pepperidge--"
50:39;50:40;"- It's a classy company."
50:40;50:44;"- No, because Pepperidge Farm is old-school Puritan."
50:44;50:45;"No spice."
50:45;50:46;"- Yeah."
50:46;50:47;"- Yeah, no spice."
50:47;50:51;"You're not gonna see Blaze in a Ziploc bag anytime soon."
50:51;50:53;"Pepperidge Farm is WASP-y."
50:53;50:54;"They traced their heritage all the way,"
50:54;50:56;"directly back to England, no spice."
50:56;50:59;"All right, we figured something out."
50:59;51:00;"All right, thanks so much for calling in, Phil,"
51:00;51:03;"and everybody boycott Doritos Blaze."
51:03;51:05;"- Please do, please do."
51:05;51:07;"Buy spicy, sweet chili, or sweet, spicy chili,"
51:07;51:10;"or spicy, sweet heat if you're in Canada."
51:10;51:11;"Thanks for having me, dudes."
51:11;51:12;"- All right, have a good one, man."
51:12;51:13;"- Have a good night. - Thank you, bye."

53:43;53:49;"- You're listening to Time Crisis on Beat One."
53:49;53:52;"- All right, we're now joined in the studio by Chris Baio."
53:52;53:53;"Welcome back to the program."
53:53;53:55;"- Pleasure to be back."
53:55;53:57;"- You're kind of a Doritos guy, right?"
53:57;53:59;"- Yeah, I haven't been for a while."
53:59;54:02;"I guess we were just talking off mic about Doritos,"
54:02;54:06;"but I've lived in England the last five years,"
54:06;54:09;"but they're not as spicy over there."
54:09;54:11;"It's interesting to come in the middle of that conversation"
54:11;54:13;"'cause I haven't tried these Blaze,"
54:13;54:15;"and I'm curious how they relate to the other."
54:15;54:16;"- Oh yeah, you love spicy stuff."
54:16;54:18;"- Yeah, I might feel differently from Phil,"
54:18;54:21;"but I have to try it before I can definitively weigh in."
54:21;54:24;"But yeah, I always liked spicy nacho when I was growing up."
54:24;54:26;"- We gotta get you some Doritos Blaze."
54:26;54:27;"- Yeah, I'd love that."
54:27;54:30;"- Off mic about Doritos is the best phrase ever."
54:30;54:32;"(laughing)"
54:32;54:37;"- We had a hot mic, hot Doritos conversation."
54:37;54:40;"So Chris, last time you were on the show,"
54:40;54:42;"you were telling us about your relationship"
54:42;54:45;"to Sting and Shaggy, who recently put out an album."
54:45;54:48;"- Mm-hmm, and I'll say that things have only heated up"
54:48;54:51;"between me and them since then."
54:51;54:54;"- So we were talking to you as the rollout was happening"
54:54;54:55;"for the Sting and Shaggy album."
54:55;54:56;"- Yeah."
54:56;54:58;"- So what's been the fallout since the album?"
54:58;55:00;"(laughing)"
55:00;55:04;"I mean, I feel like in America, it didn't get great reviews."
55:04;55:05;"There's some haters."
55:05;55:09;"- Well, I think that a lot of the reviews did point out"
55:09;55:12;"and notice that they have an undeniable chemistry,"
55:12;55:16;"and it is, even some of the maybe mediocre reviews"
55:16;55:17;"would point out that, you know what,"
55:17;55:19;"Sting sounds like he's having a great time."
55:19;55:22;"He hasn't sounded fun on a record in forever,"
55:22;55:25;"and you kinda can't knock that ultimately."
55:25;55:27;"It went in at number one."
55:27;55:29;"I looked this up before I came over here"
55:29;55:32;"in Argentina, Austria, Poland, and Germany."
55:32;55:34;"- What about America?"
55:34;55:36;"- It went in at number 40 in America."
55:36;55:37;"- Wow."
55:37;55:39;"- So there was actually an interview with Shaggy about it,"
55:39;55:41;"and he said that he feels like the US market"
55:41;55:45;"is so obsessed with youth that that was kinda what hurt them."
55:45;55:46;"- You know, he's kinda right."
55:46;55:49;"I think that's always been the case a little bit."
55:49;55:50;"I always noticed, even in the UK,"
55:50;55:53;"which is not so different from America in many ways,"
55:53;55:58;"over there it's like the kinda classic UK aging song."
55:58;56:01;"Like a Paul Weller album would always be number one."
56:01;56:02;"- Yeah, definitely."
56:02;56:05;"- People who are like Noel Gallagher, Liam Gallagher."
56:05;56:07;"I guess in America, like a Bruce Springsteen album"
56:07;56:08;"would probably go to number one, but--"
56:08;56:09;"- Really?"
56:09;56:11;"Like a new Springsteen record?"
56:11;56:12;"- I think so."
56:12;56:13;"- I don't know, maybe."
56:13;56:15;"- I have no idea."
56:15;56:16;"I find that shocking."
56:16;56:18;"- But generally speaking, I think Shaggy's right."
56:18;56:20;"- Yeah, so to use that example,"
56:20;56:22;"it went in at number nine in England"
56:22;56:23;"as opposed to 40 here."
56:23;56:25;"- How'd it do in Jamaica?"
56:25;56:27;"- Yeah, I have no idea actually."
56:27;56:30;"America's one of the most like ageist, Marcus."
56:30;56:31;"- Yeah, interesting."
56:31;56:32;"But I bet they'll sell some tickets."
56:32;56:34;"- Oh yeah, definitely."
56:34;56:35;"- Are they doing a tour?"
56:35;56:37;"- Yeah, I mean they're doing all Europe."
56:37;56:39;"Now, because I've been so outspoken"
56:39;56:41;"in my support of Sting and Shaggy,"
56:41;56:44;"people kinda come at me with information,"
56:44;56:49;"either insider or stuff that's on TV that I'll miss."
56:49;56:51;"But like, I know that they're gonna be playing"
56:51;56:53;"somewhere near where we are right now"
56:53;56:54;"sometime in the fall."
56:54;56:55;"- Ooh."
56:55;56:57;"- But I don't wanna jump on their announcement"
56:57;56:59;"'cause I don't believe it's been announced yet."
56:59;57:01;"But I'm getting like some really dope insider info"
57:01;57:02;"on Sting and Shaggy."
57:02;57:05;"In addition to like just having people message me,"
57:05;57:07;"like they were on Watch What Happens Live"
57:07;57:09;"a couple weeks ago and they really crushed it."
57:09;57:11;"- So they're still having a good time doing press."
57:11;57:13;"- They were so good on Watch What Happens Live."
57:13;57:15;"They played this game with Andy Cohen"
57:15;57:17;"called It Wasn't Me or Was It?"
57:17;57:20;"And Andy Cohen would like read a fact"
57:20;57:22;"and they would both say it wasn't me."
57:22;57:25;"And Andy would try and judge from their acting"
57:25;57:27;"who the fact pertained to."
57:27;57:29;"And he only got one out of six right."
57:29;57:30;"They were such good actors."
57:30;57:31;"- Wow."
57:31;57:33;"- It'd be stuff like, this guy got his name"
57:33;57:35;"from a sweater that he wore."
57:35;57:37;"And Sting would say it wasn't me."
57:37;57:38;"Shaggy would say it wasn't me."
57:38;57:41;"- Ooh, that is a tough, I know the answer is Sting,"
57:41;57:42;"but Shaggy makes more sense."
57:42;57:45;"- Yeah, Andy Cohen said Shaggy and he got it wrong."
57:45;57:46;"- Wow."
57:46;57:47;"- I mean, they were on Tonight Show"
57:47;57:50;"with Adam Sandler, aka The Sandman."
57:50;57:51;"There was a really good photo of Shaggy"
57:51;57:54;"with Adam Sandler on Shaggy's socials"
57:54;57:55;"that are really dog."
57:55;57:56;"- Well, I don't know if you know,"
57:56;57:59;"they were also on Ebro's show right here on Beats 1."
57:59;58:00;"- Oh (beep)"
58:00;58:01;"- And you can check that out"
58:01;58:04;"if you dig into the Apple Music archives."
58:04;58:05;"- Do that first thing."
58:05;58:06;"- Maybe we should try to get them on this show."
58:06;58:07;"- I'm sure they would."
58:07;58:08;"- Let's take this all the way."
58:08;58:11;"- I mean, see, Time Crash, we really stopped having"
58:11;58:13;"like the kind of big celebrity guests."
58:13;58:15;"We basically don't have people come on"
58:15;58:17;"when they're on their press tours."
58:17;58:18;"- Right."
58:18;58:19;"- We have kind of friends and family"
58:19;58:22;"or kind of experts like Phil Matariz"
58:22;58:23;"talking about Doritos."
58:23;58:27;"In the early days, we had, you know, Jamie Foxx."
58:27;58:28;"- Yeah."
58:28;58:29;"- Who else do we have?"
58:29;58:31;"Mark Ronson, Florence."
58:31;58:32;"Yeah, that's hilarious."
58:32;58:34;"I think about the early time crises"
58:34;58:36;"where it was kind of me in New York"
58:36;58:37;"just figuring stuff out"
58:37;58:40;"and it's like just interviewing like Mark and Florence."
58:40;58:41;"Feels like a distant memory now."
58:41;58:43;"- I remember like the second show I did with you."
58:43;58:45;"You were like, ""Yeah, Jamie Foxx is coming in."""
58:45;58:47;"And I was like, ""What is this show?"""
58:47;58:48;"[laughter]"
58:48;58:52;"Like, I don't have anything to add to that conversation."
58:52;58:54;"- Jamie, I'm gonna stop you right there."
58:54;58:56;"I gotta disagree with you, Matt."
58:56;58:58;"- I mean, I think you guys should have Sting and Shaggy"
58:58;58:59;"when they're coming through town."
58:59;59:01;"- Yeah, but Sting, I think it'd be cool."
59:01;59:03;"Sting and Shaggy, I wonder if when they go on tour,"
59:03;59:05;"they'll be dropping some of their solo hits."
59:05;59:06;"- Oh, absolutely."
59:06;59:08;"Neither of them are gonna leave the stage the whole time."
59:08;59:09;"I think they have to figure out"
59:09;59:11;"what Shaggy's gonna do during like police songs,"
59:11;59:14;"but Sting will play bass on ""It Wasn't Me,"""
59:14;59:15;"stuff like that. - Oh, that's sick."
59:15;59:16;"- No, it's gonna be fun."
59:16;59:17;"I hope I get to see it."
59:17;59:19;"- So fields of gold right into ""It Wasn't Me."""
59:19;59:20;"- Yeah, totally."
