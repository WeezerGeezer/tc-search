00:00;00:02;"Time Crisis."
00:02;00:04;"Back again."
00:04;00:07;"What's that sound?"
00:07;00:10;"Sounds like glass hitting the pavement."
00:10;00:15;"Oh, it's just the new album from Rolling Stones, Hackney Diamonds."
00:15;00:25;"All this, plus Major League Baseball, and the top hits of 1964 and today."
00:26;00:31;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:32;00:36;"Time Crisis."
00:37;00:43;"They passed me by, all of those great romances"
00:43;00:50;"They were a belt from a knee, all my rightful chances"
00:50;00:57;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy"
00:57;01:04;"And so I dealt to the floor, when a bus had to go"
01:04;01:09;"Now it's different, I want you to know"
01:09;01:15;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying"
01:15;01:19;"In a lonely bed"
01:19;01:22;"Alright, Time Crisis, back again."
01:22;01:26;"There's that classic first set energy."
01:26;01:28;"Oh yeah."
01:28;01:31;"I'm still tuning, I'm not ready."
01:31;01:34;"The band started, the band started without me."
01:34;01:39;"Everybody just kind of wandering onto the stage haphazardly."
01:39;01:41;"Did the Dead have set lists or not?"
01:41;01:43;"I'm not clear on this."
01:43;01:46;"They must have discussed what they're going to open with though."
01:46;01:48;"Or did Jerry just call it?"
01:48;01:53;"They must have been backstage being like, ""Okay, let's open with Johnny B. Goode and then we'll go into He's Gone."""
01:53;01:57;"Right? Or they just had no, they walked out with no plans."
01:57;02:04;"It's a good question about the first song because, I mean, they claim Jerry was just kind of making game time decisions throughout the show."
02:04;02:12;"And you can tell when you watch like a footage of an old show if he's kind of just like, you know, a song finishes and he's just..."
02:12;02:15;"And they're like, ""Okay."" And then they follow him."
02:15;02:16;"Yeah."
02:16;02:19;"But yeah, first song, that's a good question."
02:19;02:22;"You think they're walking in, no idea."
02:22;02:28;"Everybody gets their s*** together and then Jerry just starts playing something? It always starts with him?"
02:28;02:32;"I think there's shows that open with like a Bobby song sometimes."
02:32;02:37;"But you think Jerry just starts playing like a Bobby song, Bobby's like, ""Oh s***,"" walks up to the mic."
02:37;02:43;"I don't know. This is the whole query about the first song. I mean, I've always wondered this."
02:43;02:48;"I mean, I assume this is like common knowledge for the hardcore Dead."
02:48;02:49;"Oh yeah, I'm sure."
02:49;02:56;"This is funny. I'm reading a Steve Hoffman forum. It says, ""I don't think,"" obviously, grain of salt."
02:56;03:01;"This is somebody that might not know anything, but they said, ""I don't think they did set lists."
03:01;03:08;"I think they would say on stage something like, 'Hey, let's maybe do 'They Love Each Other' followed by 'Big River.'"""
03:08;03:09;"Okay."
03:09;03:15;"Maybe that's it. Maybe it's something super loose. As they're walking out, they have some starting, you know?"
03:15;03:19;"I'm picturing a funny guy. He's a Grateful Dead truther."
03:19;03:28;"And he's just like, ""Every set list was mapped out well in advance, and many of Jerry's solos were fully composed."""
03:28;03:33;"They didn't improvise at all. Yeah, if you Google it, it says they planned out the first song and the last song."
03:33;03:39;"Okay. Yeah, all right. See, that makes sense. Like you said, they plan out the first song, but you don't know what's coming after that."
03:39;03:42;"Yeah, it might be too awkward if they didn't plan out the first song."
03:42;03:49;"It'd just be like, ""Who's making the first move here?"" Or they start two different songs at the same time."
03:49;03:53;"Or there's a couple songs that are a little bit similar. Yeah, that could be a real train wreck."
03:53;03:59;"I like it when there's four minutes of silence between songs. Like if you're listening to a show."
03:59;04:03;"Oh, yeah. A little bit of tuning, a little bit just milling around."
04:03;04:06;"Jerry just being like, ""What should we do next?"""
04:06;04:11;"You know, we've done a few Richard Picture shows with no set lists. How'd that go?"
04:11;04:15;"Great. It's better for us to plan because then we all kind of blank out."
04:15;04:23;"We're like, ""What are the songs do we know?"" I don't know. I wonder if Jerry ever had any moments where he just completely blanked."
04:23;04:28;"Right. He was just like, ""Ah."" He's like, ""Man, I've been listening to a lot of Steely Dan lately."""
04:28;04:34;"But yeah, we don't know any of their songs. F*** Grateful Dead songs."
04:34;04:41;"Oh, speaking of Grateful Dead songs, Richard Pictures is playing November 2nd at Gold Diggers."
04:41;04:45;"Oh, nice. Anything new? Or maybe no spoilers?"
04:45;04:48;"No spoilers. But we're working on a few new ones."
04:48;04:50;"They never before played?"
04:50;04:54;"I think we're going to do one that they never played."
04:54;04:56;"Because it's not a Grateful Dead song?"
04:56;05:01;"Correct. It's one that they totally could have played, but didn't."
05:01;05:07;"Is that a first? Is a cover band for a band ever played songs that the band they're covering?"
05:07;05:13;"I'm sure other Grateful Dead cover bands have done this before, but it's called speculative fiction."
05:13;05:15;"[laughs]"
05:15;05:17;"It's a great one."
05:17;05:25;"Now everybody knows that Grateful Dead never covered Dirty Work by Steely Dan, but what Richard Pictures is asking is, ""What if they did?"""
06:14;06:16;"It's like The Man in the High Castle."
06:16;06:17;"Yeah."
06:17;06:25;"Exactly. How about you even take it a step further? I've never actually seen the show, read the book, Man in the High Castle. Have any of you guys?"
06:25;06:28;"I watched an episode or two. It's like where the Nazis win World War II."
06:28;06:42;"Yeah. And then I've seen the map that the US is divided into the Nazi East Coast and the Japanese West Coast. Can I get a number crunch? In The Man in the High Castle, what's the Japanese Western US called?"
06:42;06:43;"We don't have Seinfeld here."
06:43;06:45;"Okay. That's on you, Nick."
06:45;06:47;"I'm on it."
06:47;06:48;"Oh, Seinfeld here?"
06:48;06:50;"Yeah. Can you hear me? My [beep] is all [beep] up."
06:50;06:52;"Okay. I can hear you."
06:52;06:54;"It's the Japanese Pacific States."
06:54;06:55;"Okay. Thank you."
06:55;07:03;"I can't see myself and I can't... When you said, ""Am I on this call?"" I was like, ""Am I on this call?"" That's where it's at for me. Anyway."
07:03;07:05;"This is going to be a trippy show."
07:05;07:06;"Yeah."
07:06;07:18;"How about this? Let's go one step further. We're a Grateful Dead cover band. We're not just one of those cover bands like Richard Pictures that might throw in a non-dead song and speculate what would the dead have done with it."
07:18;07:29;"We're from the Philip K. Dick Man in the High Castle universe. So actually, our version of Grateful Dead is from the Japanese Pacific States. Is that what it... Seinfeld?"
07:29;07:32;"It's the Japanese Pacific States. Yeah."
07:32;07:47;"So we're from Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco. Maybe they'd give that a new name. And we... Yeah. You know what? We're a bunch of American dudes. We grew up under the Japanese flag, the Pacific States of Japanese Pacific States."
07:47;08:06;"After World War II, US lost the war, but it's all good. We're still out here playing good music, enjoying life under the control of Imperial Japan. Acid still made its way to San Francisco in the 1960s, even under Japanese control."
08:06;08:29;"And as a kind of protest against the Imperial Japanese occupation, we still like to play a mix of kind of a heritage American music, drawn on elements of folk, country, and blues. But we also break off a little bit of Japanese flavor in honor of the country that won World War II along with the Germans."
08:29;08:49;"And yeah, that's like our whole project is we're just kind of imagining what would the Grateful Dead sound like if the Axis won World War II? They'd probably have some songs in Japanese. They'd probably be covering, have a different set of covers. I think it could be really fun."
08:49;08:51;"Maybe a garage rock influence?"
08:51;08:59;"Well, the Dead did have a garage rock influence. There's like a couple early Dead songs, I'd say are like pretty garagey."
08:59;09:00;"Cold Rain?"
09:00;09:14;"Yeah. And I find those are something on, even on working bands, it's got a little bit of garagey energy to me. But yeah, I think that's the next level for jam bands is to also involve alternative history."
09:14;09:24;"And then maybe if it continues into now and they're in the Grateful Dead and Co. era of the cover bands, they have a J-pop singer instead of a John Mayer."
09:24;09:51;"Oh yeah. In this universe, John Mayer, of course, was never born. It's kind of dark, but... Yeah, because there have been... Jake, we've always talked about the fun of kind of like speculating about having a Dead cover band that covered song. Wasn't that like a concept you had? A Dead cover band that covered non-Dead songs exclusively in the style of the Grateful Dead?"
09:51;10:12;"Yeah. I mean, it's something we've thrown around. I mean, one time we did Althea into Plush by the Stone Temple Pilots back into Althea. We didn't do like full Plush. We did like, we were in the middle of Althea, then we went into like the Plush riff and then we went into like the ""And I feel, and I feel..."" Or no, no, it goes into the..."
10:12;10:28;"Oh God, what's the... I can't remember how the middle part of Plush goes, but we did that once. Real novelty stuff. The one we're working on is like something they totally could have done. It would not... Most people would probably be like, ""Oh, Jerry, JGB must have done that song."""
10:28;10:31;"Right. You're not picking a song from after Jerry died."
10:31;10:38;"No, no, no. But this, yeah, no, that was an idea we had of like, what if the Dead played like Salisbury Hill by Peter Gabriel? Like what if..."
10:38;10:39;"It's a great idea."
10:39;10:48;"What if the Dead had done like a Clash song? I also thought they could have done like Training Vein or something."
10:48;10:49;"Oh, totally."
10:49;11:13;"You say you stand by your man Tell me something I don't understand You said you loved me, and that's a fact And then you left me, said you felt trapped Well, some things you can't explain away But the heartaches in me still this day"
11:13;11:21;"You didn't stand by me No, not at all You didn't stand by me No way"
11:21;11:31;"Jake, what's that Instagram account you love? You showed me and there was like a dude ripping a Jerry type solo for Dancing Queen by ABBA. And it made total sense."
11:31;11:34;"The Jerry Tone Store or something?"
11:34;11:57;"Right. So, you know, Jerry has such a distinctive style. It's like a solid guitarist can play something pretty cool. Like what if Jerry was playing, doing a version of Dancing Queen? And it sounds accurate. And I told you guys about, I came across a, there's a jam band called Walrus. And their whole concept is they do Beatles songs, but fully as like a Grateful Dead style jam band."
11:57;11:58;"Oh, really?"
11:58;12:04;"Yeah, they'll like, they'll stretch out like do like, you know, seven, eight minute and your bird can sing."
12:04;12:05;"Oh, I can see that."
12:05;12:06;"Just ripping some solos."
12:06;12:09;"Like, they had to do it. I picture it like it's slower."
12:09;12:12;"[Humming]"
12:12;12:22;"It makes a lot of sense because the Beatles don't jam. But there's obviously a lot of like jam band people who the Beatles are probably one of their, you know, all time faves."
12:22;12:28;"Well, it's funny you say the Beatles because that's, I'll drop this hint. We're working on a Beatles song."
12:28;12:33;"Okay. Which definitely wasn't unheard of with the Dead or JGB, Dear Prudence."
12:33;12:35;"Yep. Totally."
12:35;12:49;"These are all great ideas, but I'm saying go one step further for the history buffs. I'm going to start a band that's the same concept as Walrus, but for some reason it also involves America losing World War II."
12:49;12:50;"That's really deep."
12:50;12:52;"It's called Das Walrus."
12:52;13:00;"I think your audience would start to thin pretty quickly. That's a lot of homework."
13:00;13:14;"I was so excited to see an Allman Brothers type take on And Your Bird Can Sing, but there was swastikas everywhere and be like, hey guys, this is speculative fiction, man."
13:14;13:16;"They were singing in German too."
13:18;13:25;"Guys, this is speculative fiction. What do you want me to do? The US, in my universe, the US lost World War II. It f*cking sucks."
13:25;13:31;"All right, guys. You know, there's the Philip Roth book, The Plot Against America."
13:31;13:32;"I was just going to mention."
13:32;13:34;"That has a big old swastika on the front."
13:34;13:35;"Yeah."
13:35;13:44;"Okay. Maybe because of course, you're not going to get a lot of shows if there's swastikas on stage. Ours is just like slightly more eerie."
13:44;13:56;"And we're just like, we're a jam band that does Beatles songs. And in our universe, Charles Lindbergh was elected president of the United States."
13:56;13:59;"And just like, going to leave it at that."
14:03;14:08;"Well, what do you mean? What changed? Charles Lindbergh was president of the United States."
14:08;14:11;"He beat FDR. He beat FDR in the 1936 election."
14:11;14:19;"That's all we're saying. Well, how does that play out on stage? You know, we're still just regular guys wearing regular clothes."
14:19;14:25;"Just some of the in-between songs banter. There's a lot of thank you, President Lindbergh for keeping us out of World War II."
14:25;14:27;"There's that kind of stuff."
14:29;14:37;"You're still thinking a president from decades ago. I mean, I sort of, you know, because you're not supposed to be, it's not like the Decemberists or something. You're not in the period of the time."
14:37;14:46;"Maybe we're in the sixties. We are the Beatles, except we're into jamming. And Lindbergh was a 10-term president who beat FDR."
14:46;14:52;"These are just weird ones. We're not trying to ruffle any feathers. This is just for history bucks."
14:52;14:54;"You don't make the rules."
14:54;14:56;"Okay. How about, what's a more of a kind vibe one?"
14:56;14:58;"How about this? Kennedy doesn't get killed."
14:58;15:09;"Okay. Yeah, we do Bob Dylan covers if Kennedy wasn't killed. And we jam at Bob Dylan. How about one? We're the Strokes, but 9/11 didn't happen."
15:09;15:10;"Ooh."
15:10;15:13;"And we jam."
15:13;15:14;"Wow, you sound exactly the same."
15:14;15:21;"But we jam a little bit. We jam a little more."
15:21;15:24;"Maybe not as popular, but sound exactly the same."
15:25;15:30;"It's just something for the history buffs and the music fans. You know, there's significant crossover."
15:34;15:36;"I still miss the good old days"
15:36;15:40;"Someday, someday"
15:40;15:43;"Yeah, it hurts to say"
15:43;15:45;"But I want you to stay"
15:45;15:49;"Sometimes, sometimes"
15:49;15:52;"When we were young"
15:52;15:54;"How many did we have fun?"
15:54;15:58;"Always, always"
15:58;16:03;"With promises, they break before they're made"
16:03;16:07;"Sometimes, sometimes"
16:07;16:13;"All my answers are like any dance"
16:13;16:16;"I will do my best"
16:16;16:21;"You say you wanna stay by my side"
16:21;16:25;"Darling, your head's not right"
16:25;16:29;"I still always die and together we fall apart"
16:29;16:34;"Yeah, I think I'll be alright"
16:34;16:39;"I'm working so I won't have to try so hard"
16:39;16:43;"Tables may turn sometimes"
16:43;16:49;"Oh, someday"
16:49;16:53;"No, I ain't wasting no more time"
16:53;16:57;"Well, speaking of history buffs and music fans"
16:57;17:02;"There's a new Rolling Stones album out, guys."
17:02;17:04;"I've heard a bunch of it. It's solid."
17:04;17:09;"I listened to it today, running errands, and I went for a run and listened to it."
17:09;17:14;"And how many stars out of five, Jake?"
17:14;17:16;"Two and a half."
17:16;17:18;"Okay, right down the middle. Right down the middle."
17:18;17:21;"Is that a good review for you, Jake?"
17:21;17:23;"Well, maybe I'll give it three."
17:23;17:26;"Will you be listening again outside of time crisis?"
17:26;17:27;"No."
17:27;17:28;"Okay."
17:28;17:29;"I will not."
17:29;17:32;"Was it an interesting listen? Absolutely."
17:32;17:37;"Well, let's get into it. This is major. New Rolling Stones album."
17:37;17:43;"The first album of original material in seven, wait, 18 years."
17:43;17:47;"The first since Charlie Watts died in 2021."
17:47;17:50;"Got special guests like Paul McCartney."
17:50;17:51;"He's on there?"
17:51;17:53;"Yeah, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder."
17:53;17:56;"I did not hear Paul or Stevie singing."
17:56;17:58;"Maybe they were just, you know."
17:58;18:00;"Maybe Paul's just playing bass."
18:00;18:01;"Yeah."
18:01;18:02;"Well, first, let's talk the title."
18:02;18:05;"Do you guys know what Hackney Diamonds are?"
18:05;18:05;"No."
18:05;18:08;"I happened to learn it because I was talking about this album the past week."
18:08;18:11;"So I learned it from a friend of the show, Chris Bayo."
18:11;18:11;"Okay."
18:11;18:18;"So Hackney is known as a kind of rough and tumble neighborhood of London,"
18:18;18:23;"although it's also been significantly gentrified in the 21st century."
18:23;18:30;"But Hackney Diamonds refers to broken up little pieces of glass on the ground"
18:30;18:35;"because somebody smashed in a window for like a robbery or who knows why."
18:35;18:39;"So it's a kind of a, it's like a funny phrase, you know,"
18:39;18:43;"talking about the glass on the ground in a rough and tumble neighborhood."
18:43;18:44;"Hackney Diamonds."
18:44;18:45;"Now, were the stones from Hackney?"
18:45;18:47;"I don't think so."
18:47;18:47;"Huh."
18:47;18:51;"So they're just name checking a neighborhood in London that"
18:52;18:54;"has nothing to do with their own history."
18:54;18:56;"I just assumed they were from Hackney."
18:56;18:58;"No, I think it make us from Dartford."
18:58;19:03;"But what you're saying is that it's an expression that extends beyond the neighborhood."
19:03;19:05;"That's a good question."
19:05;19:09;"It has broad application in British society, Hackney Diamonds."
19:09;19:11;"Now that I don't know about."
19:11;19:12;"Yeah."
19:12;19:18;"Like are you in, you're in like South London in Brixton and someone smashes in a window and he's"
19:18;19:19;"a check it out Hackney Diamonds."
19:19;19:21;"Kind of doubt that."
19:22;19:25;"It might also be one of those phrases that nobody particularly uses."
19:25;19:27;"It just sounds good when you hear about it."
19:27;19:32;"Like, you know, like one of those phrases that people talk about more than actually use."
19:32;19:34;"What's another example of that?"
19:34;19:39;"Well, I always think of this one that somebody said to me very confidently and I never heard,"
19:39;19:40;"heard it again."
19:40;19:41;"It's a guy."
19:41;19:44;"I mean, this guy always cracked me up."
19:44;19:46;"He's a funny guy, but he was, he didn't seem to be joking."
19:46;19:50;"He was like, oh, I did the craziest fight with my girlfriend."
19:50;19:52;"I was like, oh yeah, what happened?"
19:52;19:55;"He's like, she, she got, she got so mad at me or something."
19:55;19:56;"I said, she kicked me out."
19:56;19:58;"I was down on the sidewalk."
19:58;20:00;"She's throwing my clothes."
20:00;20:05;"She's throwing my clothes out the window, yelling at me, you know, a Brooklyn breakup."
20:05;20:06;"And I was like, what do you mean?"
20:06;20:09;"He's like, you know, that's what, you've never heard the phrase of Brooklyn breakup."
20:09;20:10;"And I was like, no."
20:10;20:12;"And he was like, yeah, you know, Brooklyn breakup."
20:12;20:14;"Someone's yelling out the window, throw the clothes out the window."
20:14;20:15;"That's called a Brooklyn breakup."
20:15;20:19;"And I can't, I don't even remember if this dude lived in Brooklyn."
20:20;20:20;"But he said that."
20:20;20:22;"And then I feel like I was like, oh, that's hilarious."
20:22;20:27;"I mean, not, not the misfortune of this couple fighting, but the phrase."
20:27;20:30;"And then I just never heard it again for the rest of my life."
20:30;20:33;"And I was just like, you just got to make that up, a Brooklyn breakup."
20:33;20:37;"But I'm just saying, that's the type of thing that, you know, like Vampire Weekend"
20:37;20:40;"call an album, never would, but call it Brooklyn breakup."
20:40;20:43;"And then, you know, do some press and be like, what do you, so what's a Brooklyn breakup?"
20:43;20:47;"I was like, you know, it's a phrase that refers to this kind of very emotional yelling"
20:47;20:48;"out the window kind of breakup."
20:49;20:51;"You know, and be like, well, how would you even use that in a sentence?"
20:51;20:52;"You wouldn't."
20:52;20:54;"It's just like a thing people say."
20:54;20:54;"Yeah."
20:54;20:57;"There's, there's nothing on Google about Brooklyn breakups."
20:57;20:59;"Zero."
20:59;21:01;"I think this guy just made it up."
21:01;21:05;"I think he saw too many Spike Lee movies and he's sort of like, yeah, it's a Brooklyn breakup."
21:05;21:06;"You know, yelling out the window."
21:06;21:09;"It's also funny like the, that Brooklyn's changed so much."
21:09;21:09;"Right."
21:09;21:10;"Yeah."
21:10;21:13;"A Brooklyn breakup now, like, uh, we changed the locks on the doors."
21:13;21:14;"I called my lawyer."
21:14;21:14;"Yeah."
21:14;21:17;"I sent a Snapchat to let him know."
21:17;21:21;"Chloe, Grace Moritz and Brooklyn Beckham breakup."
21:21;21:23;"Yeah, exactly."
21:23;21:25;"That's what a Brooklyn breakup is now."
21:25;21:27;"Well, so what does it say for Hackney diamonds?"
21:27;21:28;"When you look up definition?"
21:28;21:29;"Wait, okay."
21:29;21:31;"Hold on guys."
21:31;21:37;"So I'm reading about this cause there's no, you can't find any expression on it."
21:37;21:43;"The news is only about the album title and it said, um, Richard stated that it refers"
21:43;21:49;"to broken left over from, uh, left over in the morning after a quote, good Saturday night"
21:49;21:50;"that went bad."
21:50;21:52;"I really actually don't know what that means."
21:52;21:54;"A good Saturday night that went bad."
21:54;21:55;"Everybody's having a good time."
21:55;21:57;"A fun Saturday night."
21:57;22:03;"Guy said, guy said to his buddies, Hey, if you guys help, help me move these 10 heavy"
22:03;22:08;"delicate sheets of glass from my apartment to the warehouse, I'll provide the beer."
22:08;22:11;"All right, let's do this."
22:11;22:12;"Everybody's having a good time."
22:13;22:16;"Then get a little too drunk."
22:16;22:19;"Next thing you know, shattered glass everywhere."
22:19;22:21;"Another Saturday night ruined."
22:21;22:27;"I do want to point out like your friend Ezra, Richard stated it refers to broken glass."
22:27;22:29;"There's no corroboration."
22:29;22:31;"Oh, that's a good, I'd have to ask Bayo."
22:31;22:33;"Did you hear this from like when you were in London?"
22:33;22:35;"When he was reading the Wikipedia."
22:35;22:37;"Cause I could see it's equally, it's equally plausible."
22:37;22:41;"Maybe he also was just like researching the album and say, Oh, you know what I read?"
22:41;22:42;"I actually don't know."
22:42;22:43;"I'll have to ask him."
22:43;22:45;"So maybe it is like Brooklyn breakup."
22:45;22:49;"You know, another one that comes to mind is like Sicilian necktie."
22:49;22:53;"You know, when people speak very confidently about like these, uh, kind of like mobster"
22:53;22:56;"gangster type ways of like hurting somebody."
22:56;22:57;"Oh, Sicilian necktie."
22:57;23:02;"And you're like, I don't know if like actual, like some old school mafia guy talks about"
23:02;23:08;"a Sicilian necktie, or that's just something that like writers and like, you know, people"
23:08;23:10;"like us jawbone about, you know what I mean?"
23:11;23:16;"Like if you were actually a Sicilian gangster, would you use the expression Sicilian necktie?"
23:16;23:17;"Yeah."
23:17;23:20;"It sounds like something like probably not like a New York post journalist in the fifties"
23:20;23:26;"wrote, you know, made up just to give a little more color for their like mafia reporting."
23:26;23:28;"I just asked chat GPT about it."
23:28;23:34;"And they say this term is not related to any actual practices or customs in Sicily or any"
23:34;23:39;"other region, but as a creation of the dark world of crime fiction."
23:39;23:39;"Right."
23:39;23:40;"Fiction."
23:40;23:40;"Yeah."
23:40;23:42;"What about Hackney diamonds?"
23:42;23:44;"I found a Mick Jagger quote."
23:44;23:44;"Yeah."
23:44;23:44;"Okay."
23:44;23:45;"Great."
23:45;23:52;"Jimmy Fallon asks Mick Jagger if Hackney diamonds was a type of slang to which Mick Jagger replied."
23:52;23:52;"Yeah."
23:52;23:57;"It's like when you get your windscreen broken on a Saturday night in Hackney and all the"
23:57;24:01;"bits go on the street, that's Hackney diamonds."
24:01;24:06;"So someone broke your wind shield on a Saturday night in Hackney."
24:06;24:07;"All right."
24:07;24:13;"The alternate titles for this album were hit and run and smash and grab."
24:13;24:14;"Well, they chose right."
24:14;24:16;"Smash and grab."
24:16;24:17;"Those are terrible."
24:17;24:21;"I'm saying both of those align hit and run a little bit."
24:21;24:22;"That's darker, I guess."
24:22;24:25;"What if they called it come and go like that?"
24:25;24:30;"Uh, that Midwestern, uh, gas station or like convenience store chain."
24:30;24:31;"Everybody knows that one, right?"
24:31;24:33;"It's K U M and go."
24:33;24:36;"It's infamous."
24:36;24:37;"Come and go."
24:37;24:41;"If the Rolling Stones new album was called come and go with a K, that would just be like,"
24:41;24:43;"drop the mic."
24:43;24:49;"Best album since some girls 10 out of 10, like bow down."
24:49;24:52;"From when they were touring the Midwest."
24:52;24:56;"And Mick Jagger, you know, I've talked about this, how I was obsessed with the fact that,"
24:56;25:00;"um, I wasn't at the show, but I read about how, that when they played Met life,"
25:00;25:04;"which will always be giant stadium to me in New Jersey,"
25:04;25:08;"that he apparently went to the Tik Tok diner,"
25:08;25:11;"which is like a famous diner on the highway."
25:11;25:12;"Everybody in New Jersey has been there."
25:12;25:15;"And then on stage, he like talked about it."
25:15;25:17;"Cause he, you know, he's the ultimate showman."
25:17;25:19;"He goes out of his way to bring a little bit of local flavor."
25:19;25:23;"And he just went and he was, you know, and he was like, maybe I've never heard the audio."
25:23;25:29;"I always picture it in him doing his kind of like fake Southern accent and just going on like,"
25:30;25:36;"now, New Jersey, you know, today I had to go to the Tik Tok diner."
25:36;25:44;"And probably was like, and he says, and I had myself some Taylor ham and Taylor ham."
25:44;25:47;"I don't know if we talked about this on the show before there's this,"
25:47;25:52;"there's like this, uh, processed meat product in New Jersey called Taylor ham."
25:52;25:53;"And half the state calls it Taylor ham."
25:53;25:55;"And the other half calls it pork roll."
25:55;25:57;"There's versions of it everywhere."
25:57;26:01;"It's like what you would have on a, you get like an egg and cheese and Taylor ham sandwich."
26:01;26:06;"But anyway, Mick Jagger, he like knew he, he, he shouted out a very specific beloved diner"
26:06;26:08;"and he shouted out Taylor ham."
26:08;26:12;"I just pictured in that voice from far away eyes."
26:12;26:12;"Oh yeah."
26:12;26:14;"I was listening to the country music station."
26:14;26:21;"I must've ran about 50 red lights when I had that Taylor ham at the Tik Tok diner."
26:21;26:23;"The Lord's always on your side."
26:23;26:25;"Always on your side."
26:25;26:29;"But I, can you just picture Mick Jagger, where do they have come and go?"
26:29;26:30;"It's like Ohio."
26:30;26:30;"Yeah."
26:30;26:33;"I've seen it in the Midwest, like Nebraska and Nebraska."
26:33;26:37;"Didn't see any come and go's on my recent Ohio trip."
26:37;26:44;"The last time I was here in Omaha, Nebraska in 1998 playing this beautiful stadium,"
26:44;26:49;"I got a bit parched and I found myself at an establishment called come and go."
26:50;26:57;"I walked in with Charlie, Bill and Keith, just looking for something to quench my thirst."
26:57;27:03;"But when I saw, but when I saw that fine looking woman in the corner,"
27:03;27:06;"I knew I would not be coming and going too quickly."
27:06;27:10;"Rolling stones, come and go."
27:10;27:11;"The band."
27:11;27:16;"I got a 64 ounce Dr. Pepper."
27:16;27:17;"So there's 390."
27:17;27:19;"I drank the whole thing."
27:19;27:21;"There's 395 locations."
27:21;27:21;"Whoa."
27:21;27:25;"Top three states are 101 in Iowa."
27:25;27:30;"That's 26% of all come and go's, Colorado and Missouri."
27:30;27:32;"Only three states."
27:32;27:33;"So I guess I've seen them in-"
27:33;27:33;"No, no, no, no, no."
27:33;27:37;"There's more, they're in 13 states."
27:37;27:41;"Those are the three that have 101, 83 and 58."
27:41;27:41;"Okay."
27:41;27:42;"So Iowa's number one."
27:42;27:45;"Nebraska has 20."
27:46;27:52;"When I found myself in the Buckeye state of Iowa, you make a dead man come and go."
27:52;27:55;"Come and go with a K."
27:55;27:58;"I already want to talk about Hackney Diamonds anymore."
27:58;28:01;"I'm so excited just thinking about-"
28:01;28:01;"This new one."
28:01;28:08;"The next Rolling Stones album produced by the TC crew called come and go."
28:08;28:14;"Mick is doing a lot of that far away eyes, Southern talking, which is such an all time"
28:14;28:15;"classic."
28:15;28:16;"I love that song."
28:16;28:19;"Let's put that on for any listeners who don't know this song."
28:19;28:25;"And this is why the Stones are just roll so hard is that some girls, which is like their"
28:25;28:29;"cool, urbane New York album, it's got the disco song, Miss You."
28:29;28:32;"It's got the kind of punky songs."
28:32;28:35;"And then just out of nowhere, they got this country song."
28:35;28:36;"I know."
28:36;28:38;"It's like legit good too."
28:38;28:40;"They also have that funny cover of,"
28:40;28:45;"Just my imagination running away with me."
28:45;28:47;"Track one on come and go."
28:47;28:51;"Sounds pretty similar to this."
28:51;28:54;"I was driving through Cedar Rapids, Iowa."
28:54;29:00;"I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield."
29:00;29:01;"Bakersfield."
29:01;29:05;"Listening to gospel music on the college radio station."
29:06;29:11;"The preacher said, you know, you always have the Lord by your side."
29:11;29:21;"And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran 20 red lines in his honor."
29:21;29:25;"Thank you, Jesus."
29:25;29:29;"Thank you, Lord."
29:29;29:33;"This absolutely sounds like it could be in Rachel's gemstones."
29:33;29:34;"Yeah."
29:35;29:39;"I had an arrangement to meet a girl and I was kind of late."
29:39;29:44;"And I thought by the time I got there, she'd be off."
29:44;29:48;"She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find."
29:48;29:57;"Much to my surprise, there she was sitting in the corner."
29:57;30:00;"A little blurry."
30:00;30:01;"A little blurry."
30:01;30:11;"A little blurry."
30:11;30:25;"So if you're down on your luck, then you can harmonize."
30:25;30:33;"Find a girl with far away eyes."
30:35;30:45;"And if you're downright disgusted, then life ain't worth the time."
30:45;30:53;"Get a girl with far away eyes."
30:53;31:21;"Well, the preacher came right on saying that all I had to do was sit and pray."
31:21;31:29;"All I had to do was send $10 to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus located"
31:29;31:31;"somewhere in Los Angeles, California."
31:31;31:33;"And next week they say my prayer on the radio."
31:33;31:40;"A bunch of British millionaires making that song in 1978 is seriously hilarious."
31:40;31:40;"It's hard."
31:40;31:42;"And somehow pull it off."
31:42;31:42;"Oh, totally."
31:42;31:47;"Just imagine that song on like an Ed Sheeran or Harry Styles record."
31:49;31:51;"No, it's like the insane confidence."
31:51;31:55;"And also like people might not want to admit it, but like fluency."
31:55;31:57;"Like, I love the music."
31:57;31:58;"Oh, yeah."
31:58;31:59;"I mean, that chorus is so good."
31:59;32:00;"Yeah."
32:00;32:03;"And also, as always, just like those small word choices."
32:03;32:09;"And if you're downright disgusted, then life ain't worth the time."
32:09;32:11;"Find a girl."
32:11;32:15;"I was starting to think about what the lyrics to the ""Come and Go"" song would be like."
32:16;32:21;"Like, we're out on the plains of Iowa and something about like,"
32:21;32:25;"the snow starts to falling and the cold winds blow."
32:25;32:29;"You ain't got to go home, but you can't stay at the come and go."
32:29;32:31;"Something like that."
32:31;32:33;"I like something about how you can't--"
32:33;32:36;"it's time to leave."
32:36;32:37;"Time to leave the come and go."
32:37;32:41;"Just kind of like a life on the road song."
32:41;32:45;"And of course, Mick will have some fun with the double entendre of, you know,"
32:46;32:48;"getting busy in the come and go bathroom."
32:48;32:50;"But then it's also one of those just like,"
32:50;32:53;"love them and leave them sad life on the road moments."
32:53;32:55;"You can't stay at the come and go."
32:55;32:56;"You got to go."
32:56;32:58;"Keep on moving."
32:58;33:01;"Even funnier than a bunch of millionaires,"
33:01;33:06;"then writing that girl with faraway eyes is an 80-year-old Mick Jagger"
33:06;33:09;"writing about being a truck driver in Missouri."
33:09;33:11;"Now."
33:13;33:19;"Now there are 395 come and goes across this great nation of ours,"
33:19;33:23;"of which the preponderance are in the Buckeye state of Iowa."
33:23;33:26;"As I drove my big rig from Missouri."
33:26;33:31;"He wrote the whole song just reading the Wikipedia."
33:31;33:35;"He hasn't been to Oklahoma."
33:35;33:39;"I mean, he probably at some point they, you know,"
33:39;33:41;"they traveled through, but it's been a long time."
33:41;33:43;"God."
33:43;33:47;"I bet the Stones play in Oklahoma city show on a tour."
33:47;33:48;"Oh, definitely."
33:48;33:48;"Yeah."
33:48;33:50;"I also like the idea that they may-"
33:50;33:51;"Are they in a bus?"
33:51;33:54;"I'm just saying, I don't know if they're spending a lot of time traveling through."
33:54;33:55;"Are they driving?"
33:55;33:57;"No, Mick's taking the PJ."
33:57;33:58;"Exactly."
33:58;34:01;"He's staying at the finest, the four seasons, Oklahoma city,"
34:01;34:04;"and then get not, get on a PJ."
34:04;34:07;"Yeah, I can see."
34:07;34:08;"I like, I also love the idea of the Stones."
34:08;34:10;"Like this is our Midwest album."
34:10;34:13;"You know, they love, you know, chess records, Chicago blues."
34:13;34:18;"So they can have a lot of like Chicago electric blues type stuff,"
34:18;34:20;"but then they also get to some of the surrounding states."
34:20;34:22;"Yeah, come and go."
34:22;34:26;"Wait, what number Stones album is Hackney Diamonds?"
34:26;34:27;"26."
34:27;34:28;"Okay."
34:28;34:32;"So we've talked enough about their 27th album, Come and Go."
34:32;34:35;"Let's talk about their last album, Hackney Diamonds."
34:35;34:39;"Jake, do you have a favorite song from listening?"
34:40;34:46;"I mean, I would say the theme of the album that I picked up on is basically like an old guy,"
34:46;34:49;"just being like, please just leave me alone."
34:49;34:54;"Like, oh, don't like you're, you're really on my ass."
34:54;34:56;"Please just like really classic old guy."
34:56;35:00;"Just like, I just want to be my, be by myself."
35:00;35:04;"And like, you're just like all up in my business."
35:04;35:05;"Please back off."
35:05;35:08;"Because there's, first song is Angry."
35:08;35:09;"Don't be angry with me."
35:10;35:11;"I was listening to that recently."
35:11;35:16;"Another song called Bite My Head Off, which I guess Paul McCartney plays"
35:16;35:18;"bass on Bite My Head Off."
35:18;35:21;"That's pretty much just like, don't bite my head off here."
35:21;35:24;"Just, then there's another song called Driving Me Too Hard."
35:24;35:25;"Okay."
35:25;35:27;"Which is just like, God, you're really on me."
35:27;35:28;"You're driving me too hard."
35:28;35:32;"Another song called Live By The Sword."
35:32;35:37;"I mean, he's, Mick and Keith are just like annoyed with their wives."
35:37;35:40;"That's the, that's the theme of this album, I think."
35:40;35:41;"Like lay off."
35:41;35:42;"Yeah."
35:42;35:43;"Hold on."
35:43;35:47;"I did like, I'm trying to remember which song I liked."
35:47;35:50;"I listened to the first, the first few."
35:50;35:52;"Whole Wide World, maybe?"
35:52;35:53;"I don't remember."
35:53;35:56;"Let's listen to like, I feel like I heard like track two or three and I was like, okay,"
35:56;36:01;"this kind of sounds like, I was getting some Black Crowes energy, kind of like nineties vibes."
36:01;36:02;"Yeah."
36:02;36:06;"I had this weird Uncanny Valley experience where they, they sounded like rewrites."
36:07;36:10;"Oh yeah, this has Black Crowes energy."
36:10;36:27;"It's possible Mick Jagger would like, be so pissed."
36:27;36:31;"You're saying a Rolling Stones song sounds like the Black Crowes?"
36:31;36:32;"Go to hell."
36:32;36:35;"Are you f***ing kidding me?"
36:35;36:36;"They sound like us."
36:36;36:37;"Right."
36:37;36:40;"I mean, I did have that experience a couple of times where I was like,"
36:40;36:44;"well, this reminds me of bands that the Stones clearly influenced."
36:44;36:45;"Like there were a couple of moments."
36:45;36:47;"It's hard to avoid when you've been around so long."
36:47;36:47;"Yeah."
36:47;36:49;"Then it's going to go full circle."
36:49;36:55;"There were a few moments that kind of reminded me of like Def Leppard, more of the production"
36:55;36:59;"and some of the like arrangement choices."
36:59;37:04;"They were very fleeting moments, but like, I was like, I'm sure Def Leppard was influenced"
37:04;37:06;"by the Stones."
37:06;37:26;"Yeah, this has like a kind of 90s palette to me."
37:26;37:30;"Like a tasteful 90s, like a Tom Petty 90s record."
37:30;37:32;"Yeah."
37:32;37:34;"Not mad at all."
37:34;37:36;"Yeah."
38:14;38:16;"That does not sound like the Rolling Stones."
38:16;38:18;"Yeah, what does it remind you of?"
38:18;38:22;"Like..."
38:22;38:28;"This part sounds like the Stones."
38:28;38:30;"But the other..."
38:30;38:38;"Well, that's the thing when you're on your 26th album."
38:38;38:40;"Yeah."
38:40;38:44;"You sound like the Rolling Stones and there's like going to be a touch of self-parody."
38:44;38:48;"Or like we were saying, people being like, well, it sounds more like a band that like the Rolling Stones."
38:48;38:50;"Or you do something totally different."
38:50;38:52;"Then you're like, well, it doesn't sound like the Rolling Stones."
38:52;38:54;"Yeah."
38:54;38:56;"Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
38:56;38:58;"Exactly."
39:08;39:12;"This could be an Aerosmith song from the late 90s."
39:12;39:14;"Yeah."
39:14;39:16;"And of course, Aerosmith is hugely influenced by the Stones."
39:16;39:28;"Let's hear Bite My Head Off."
39:28;39:30;"Let's hear that McCartney bass."
39:30;39:32;"This one's pretty rough as I remember."
39:34;40:00;"This one has a parental explicit lyrics warning on it."
40:02;40:16;"I'm going to ask you a real question."
40:16;40:18;"Yeah."
40:18;40:26;"So, is there anybody that becomes a new Rolling Stones fan at Hackney Diamonds?"
40:26;40:28;"I mean, who are they making music?"
40:28;40:32;"Is it just out of an impulse, like a true creative impulse?"
40:32;40:36;"Are they trying to still speak to a fan base?"
40:36;40:42;"Are they hoping someone else is like, someone's kid is like, ooh, trying to bite my head off?"
40:42;40:50;"I think, obviously the Stones are like true artists."
40:50;40:54;"And they haven't made an album in almost 20 years."
40:54;40:58;"So I think, I bet there was a sense of like inspiration."
40:58;41:04;"Or like, Mick or whoever the lads were excited to get back in work."
41:04;41:10;"So I definitely don't think it's on some like, I think the spirit moved them."
41:10;41:14;"No, and I wasn't suggesting it was, they don't need the money."
41:14;41:20;"It wasn't really that. I'm just trying to understand, is there anyone who listens, you know, and is like, oh, this is my favorite album."
41:20;41:30;"I could see, I could see like a kid who's hearing it through like the context of their parents or grandparents, maybe."
41:30;41:36;"And who like, hears the 60s and 70s stuff and it sounds really like old to them."
41:36;41:48;"And then this has the sort of like more contemporary sheen and Mick has the weird kind of like, I don't know if it's like the auto-tune or some sort of weird kind of filter on his voice the whole album."
41:48;41:52;"And I could see like a kid, like a 12 year old was being like, this is way cooler."
41:52;41:57;"This is like, this sounds much more like new and fresh to me."
41:57;42:05;"And like, if you played that kid like Brown Sugar or something, they'd just be like, this sounds like a thousand years old."
42:05;42:12;"Just like some like young American psycho kid is just like, I found the Stones work from the 60s to the 90s to be somewhat lacking."
42:12;42:16;"The recording technology just wasn't at the level yet to capture the guys."
42:16;42:20;"And the vocal sounded way too human."
42:20;42:25;"Around Hackney Diamonds is the time I really started to get turned on by their rock and roll sound."
42:25;42:29;"Yeah, I think there's probably is that kid."
42:29;42:34;"Just like a weird 13 year old talking to his math teacher."
42:34;42:37;"Teacher's like, you never checked out Exile on Main Street?"
42:37;42:39;"He's like, believe me, I've tried."
42:39;42:49;"I know the Rolling Stones are often referred to as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, but it was only on Hackney Diamonds that I really started to get a taste for what they were trying to accomplish."
42:49;42:58;"Frankly, frankly, the dull analog sound of the recordings from the 60s, 70s and 80s really turned me on."
42:58;43:01;"In the 90s, it really turned me off."
43:01;43:04;"In the 90s, things started to turn around."
43:04;43:07;"It only took 50 years for them to come into their own."
43:07;43:12;"Yeah, I could picture one kid in the country who felt that way."
43:12;43:15;"But I think also there's a..."
43:15;43:20;"I think with any band, at a certain point, you got to be like, you do what you want."
43:20;43:27;"And best case scenario, your new album, whether or not it wins over any young people."
43:27;43:32;"And in the Stones case, it's definitely got people talking about the Rolling Stones."
43:32;43:42;"It might not be that easy to imagine the American Psycho Kid, who's like, album 26 is when I finally got what everybody else was talking about."
43:42;43:50;"But you can definitely picture a kid who's like, dad or grandpa, grandma is bumping Hackney Diamonds in the car."
43:50;43:52;"And he's like, what's up with this? He's like, it's the Rolling Stones, man."
43:52;43:55;"And then suddenly he starts to put it together."
43:55;44:01;"Maybe he's just at the age where he's like, have you ever heard this song? And he plays like, you know, Paint It Black."
44:01;44:04;"And kid's like, oh yeah, I have heard that song. That's the same band."
44:04;44:07;"And he's like, yeah. And he's like, you know, Start Me Up."
44:07;44:09;"And he's like, yeah, he's like, that's from the early 80s."
44:09;44:15;"And maybe the kid's like, oh, I don't know. And I could see, like, then you start digging in."
44:15;44:21;"You know what, that sort of reminds me, have you ever talked to somebody who's like, do you ever watch X Show or whatever?"
44:21;44:27;"And they're like, yeah, I started it. And they're like, no, no, you got to, you got to get through like season two or three and it really gets going."
44:27;44:36;"And you're like, oh yeah. And you're like, I just can't even imagine at the time, this American psycho kid being like, it took 22 albums."
44:36;44:41;"But finally, the Stones sort of found the rhythm."
44:41;44:52;"Funnily enough, I had already made the decision about a year ago that October 23, I was going to listen to one Rolling Stones album a day throughout the month."
44:52;44:56;"Starting with, wait, is their first album called England's Newest Hitmakers?"
44:56;44:57;"I don't know."
44:57;45:01;"There's like an early, one of their early US albums was called England's Newest Hitmakers."
45:01;45:02;"That's awesome."
45:02;45:09;"He's like, I found the early garage rock blues stuff, hopelessly amateur."
45:09;45:20;"And only on October 26, when I popped in Hackney Diamonds, did I finally realize these guys may have something."
45:20;45:30;"You know, it's also funny is that I think because of Guitar Hero, which is already a long time ago, but Guitar Hero for, you know, let's say a couple generations,"
45:30;45:36;"millennials, maybe some older zoomers, made Paint It Black the best known Stone song."
45:36;45:42;"There's definitely kids who know Paint It Black, but don't know Start Me Up, don't know Brown Sugar."
45:42;45:48;"And Paint It Black is like, you know, a pretty unique Stone song with kind of the Indian influence, not bluesy at all."
45:48;45:54;"That would have been an interesting, weird move if on album 26, they just made like all Paint It Black vibes."
45:54;46:03;"They're like, hey, it seems like the young people like Paint It Black. So this album, a lot of sitar, a lot of our kind of like slightly gothy worldview."
46:03;46:06;"Because that is an aspect of the Rolling Stones that people like forget about."
46:06;46:10;"You got your Paint It Black, Sympathy for the Devil."
46:10;46:20;"There's that like slightly satanic, spooky, you know, gothic side of the Stones, which we haven't heard in a really long time."
46:20;46:21;"Yeah. When did that end?"
46:21;46:25;"Well, and also, I hope Mick lives for another 30 years."
46:25;46:34;"Because we love him. But whenever he feels the Grim Reaper pulling on him and he's ready to drop his David Bowie Blackstar,"
46:34;46:42;"I think that'll be a sick album. Because the Stones do have it. That is, they do have what it takes to make their Blackstar."
46:42;46:46;"Yeah, I don't know if they would. I think they have it, but I don't think they would do it."
46:46;46:49;"Because they're too much of like, you know, showbiz guys, like you were saying."
46:49;46:55;"Like Mick knows he's about to die and he just drops like, just like the horniest party album of all time."
46:55;46:56;"That would be sick."
46:56;46:59;"He's like, we got to get Mark Ronson in here."
46:59;47:01;"We got to get..."
47:01;47:06;"Stones version of Uptown Funk. Maybe that is Come and Go."
47:06;47:09;"Wait, actually that'd be sick. Come and Go is the final Stones album."
47:09;47:11;"It's like the Wrestling with Mortality album."
47:11;47:23;"But basically it's like, so Mick, if you had to look back on life, did you understand something about like the haunting nature of reality or what, you know, what it's all about?"
47:23;47:26;"And he's just like, life is just one big come and go."
47:26;47:31;"If I had to describe this crazy trip, it's just a come and go."
47:31;47:38;"I came and I went. I come and I go. That's all. And I had a good time doing it."
47:38;47:50;"I mean, there is this idea that at the end, it's like, yeah, his last record, the one that's really supposed to be reflective and meditative is featuring Bruno Mars, featuring A$AP Rocky."
47:50;47:53;"Featuring BlackPink, BTS."
47:53;48:00;"The first, just like all this stuff that seems like so kind of like cravenly about expanding the brand."
48:00;48:05;"And it's just like featuring the first Rolling Stones song in Korean."
48:06;48:14;"Just like you can totally see some other band doing it because they've got another 30 years left and they want to break into a new market."
48:14;48:18;"And you're like the Stones, like, let's see if we can break Korea."
48:18;48:26;"We have J Balvin and BlackPink. It's in Spanish, Korean."
48:26;48:34;"Wait, wait, wait. How about like a stripped down Oliver Anthony collab, but like it's produced by Timbaland?"
48:34;48:38;"Remixed with some beats."
48:38;48:46;"Also, Matt, just so people know what we're talking about in comparing, you know, Blackstar by Bowie."
48:46;48:53;"People often refer to that as one of maybe the all time great goodbye albums from an iconic artist because he knew he was sick."
48:53;49:00;"So can you play it? Is the song called Blackstar that kind of like weird Middle Eastern jazz song where he's doing like,"
49:00;49:05;"""In the vill of there is a solitary candle."" I haven't heard that song in a long time."
49:05;49:08;"I actually want to hear that. I was thinking about the album recently."
49:08;49:15;"While Matt pulls that up, I just like this idea of like the Oliver Anthony or like something really subtle comes in like this and it just says,"
49:15;49:19;"""Mike Will Made It."" And then it just like, then the beat drops."
49:19;49:23;"So you really you were thinking, oh, Mick did it."
49:23;49:25;"Mick Jagger made it."
49:26;49:36;"In the vill of a man, in the vill of a man, stands a solitary candle."
49:36;49:43;"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah."
49:43;49:46;"In the center of it all."
49:46;49:49;"Yeah, I don't see Mick and Keith going this direction."
49:49;49:53;"Although I could hear Mick's voice on this."
49:53;49:55;"Different lyrics."
49:55;50:10;"On the day of execution."
50:10;50:13;"On the day of execution."
50:13;50:15;"On the day of execution."
50:15;50:17;"Only women even smile."
50:38;50:40;"Alright, you get the idea."
50:40;50:43;"David Bowie's Black Star."
50:43;50:46;"How old was David Bowie when he died?"
50:46;50:48;"I'm gonna guess like around 70?"
50:48;50:50;"Ezra, what's your guess?"
50:50;50:52;"You know, I'm just not sure."
50:52;50:55;"Maybe in his 60s?"
50:55;50:56;"Maybe in his 60s."
50:56;51:00;"My man David Bowie, 69 years old when he died."
51:00;51:02;"69 years."
51:02;51:04;"Quite the legend."
51:04;51:09;"But yeah, I only ask that because I'm thinking about, you know, Mick Jagger being 80 now."
51:09;51:11;"Just like a full decade past that."
51:11;51:13;"Dropping Hackney Diamonds."
51:14;51:16;"Apparently they have another album that's like three quarters done."
51:16;51:18;"Okay."
51:18;51:22;"I would love it if they just start dropping an album a year like it's the 1960s again."
51:22;51:24;"Yeah, it's fun that the Stones have a new album out."
51:24;51:28;"We should talk about the special MLB promo they did."
51:28;51:40;"Where they teamed up with Major League Baseball and they released a vinyl edition of the album to go with every single MLB team."
51:40;51:41;"Very confusing."
51:41;51:48;"It's a bit confusing, but you could get a, if you're a Yankees fan, you get your Yankees edition Hackney Diamonds"
51:48;51:57;"and the Rolling Stones lips and tongue logo is made out of the Yankees logo or like Yankees colors."
51:57;52:01;"Or if you're like a St. Louis Cardinals fan, you get the St. Louis Cardinals edition."
52:01;52:07;"Noted baseball enthusiasts, the Rolling Stones."
52:07;52:10;"Yeah, baseball is like a slightly funny fit."
52:10;52:12;"I mean, Mick is famously a cricket fan."
52:12;52:16;"He turns up at the big cricket events in the UK."
52:16;52:22;"Yeah, I don't, what's the backstory on like the, I mean, it's so confusing."
52:22;52:28;"Like how many of those like Kansas City Royals copies of Hackney Diamonds are they moving?"
52:28;52:30;"Yeah."
52:30;52:32;"Is it one of those things that's like, it doesn't actually exist."
52:32;52:36;"It's like, it's made to order kind of thing."
52:36;52:37;"I wonder."
52:37;52:39;"Like so much crap that we stumble across on this show."
52:39;52:40;"Like, yeah."
52:40;52:43;"Wait, what's the least popular baseball team in America?"
52:43;52:45;"I'm going to let Matt weigh in on that."
52:45;52:47;"My guess would be the Oakland A's."
52:47;52:49;"The least popular?"
52:49;52:50;"Big market though."
52:50;52:51;"They're going to move the team."
52:51;52:52;"So that's my guess."
52:52;52:54;"Where's it going?"
52:54;52:55;"They're like, they're sitting duck."
52:55;52:56;"Vegas."
52:56;52:57;"The Vegas A's?"
52:57;52:58;"The Vegas Athletics?"
52:58;52:59;"Yeah."
52:59;53:00;"Are they building an indoor stadium?"
53:00;53:01;"Probably."
53:01;53:02;"I mean, they have to, right?"
53:02;53:04;"They absolutely have to."
53:04;53:05;"The Sphere."
53:05;53:07;"They should use the Sphere."
53:07;53:08;"Oh yeah, they're going to have games in the Sphere."
53:09;53:10;"That'd be pretty sick."
53:10;53:11;"I'm sick with that."
53:11;53:17;"But that means if you get an Oakland A's edition of Hackney Diamonds,"
53:17;53:23;"especially if the Rolling Stones hang it up anytime in the next, you know, 10, 20 years,"
53:23;53:28;"you'll be sitting on an extremely rare piece of vinyl."
53:28;53:31;"I think that could be going for upwards of $10,000."
53:31;53:36;"Any vinyl collectors out there, buy the Oakland A's edition of Hackney Diamonds."
53:37;53:41;"That's my Jim Cramer mad money pick for what to do with your life savings."
53:41;53:45;"I would invest heavily in the Oakland A's edition of Hackney Diamonds."
53:45;53:47;"Cash out in 10, 20 years."
53:47;53:49;"You'll be happy."
53:49;54:00;"I gotta just imagine they did some kind of market research of baseball fans and Rolling Stones fans."
54:00;54:02;"Old dudes."
54:02;54:03;"Do you know what I mean?"
54:03;54:06;"We're just like old dudes and they're like, this is real and this is going to sell."
54:07;54:15;"That they can just see the guys at the stadium or whatever and just be like, I just love this."
54:15;54:17;"The vinyl situation is out of control."
54:17;54:20;"I think when I was in Ohio, I sent you guys a picture."
54:20;54:26;"I was in a Walmart in like, I think it was called Eaton, Ohio."
54:26;54:30;"It was like 30 miles west of Dayton, really in farm country."
54:30;54:32;"And I went into the bathroom in the Walmart."
54:33;54:37;"I come out of the bathroom and there's a whole rack of newly reissued vinyl."
54:37;54:45;"And there was like eight copies of John Coltrane, The Love Supreme in this Walmart for sale in rural Ohio."
54:45;54:51;"And I was like, man, I get it if they're going to reissue Taylor Swift, whatever."
54:51;54:53;"Aerosmith's greatest hits."
54:53;54:56;"Well, Love Supreme is an all-timer."
54:57;55:04;"I'm dying to know how many of those Love Supremes are moving in that rural Ohio Walmart."
55:04;55:09;"It wasn't like a $15.99 reissue either."
55:09;55:13;"It was like, you know, what everything costs now, $40."
55:13;55:15;"I don't know."
55:15;55:21;"I'm so confused by this corporate retail, you know, vinyl."
55:22;55:30;"How many copies of a Love Supreme are moving? Because you would generally think that the type of person who wants a Love Supreme,"
55:30;55:40;"and I'm sure there's in rural Ohio, there's some jazz fans dotted around, you know, but like, do they want to buy it in person at a..."
55:40;55:43;"Like it's an impulse buy at Walmart."
55:43;55:49;"Yeah. Or if you're that person, do you wait until, you know, you go into Chicago for a weekend."
55:50;55:52;"And you go to like a cool record store and buy it, or do you buy it online?"
55:52;55:54;"Or just order it."
55:54;56:03;"I mean, maybe it's a bit like the gift industry where, you know, the same way you're like, oh, God, it's someone's birthday."
56:03;56:09;"What do you get them? And it's like, you kind of, there's like stores that are just like, this is random stuff that feels like a nice gift."
56:09;56:11;"Are they going to love it? Are they going to use it? Who knows?"
56:11;56:17;"But, you know, candles or weird kitchen supplies that nobody ever uses again, that kind of stuff that like,"
56:18;56:25;"maybe somebody runs in there and it's like, oh, my grandson is in a jazz band at the regional high school."
56:25;56:28;"I've heard John Coltrane. I'll get him a Love Supreme."
56:28;56:30;"It's like a coffee table book."
56:30;56:32;"Exactly. Yeah."
56:32;56:35;"There's a guy or a couple guys and they're like, oh, this guy just loves jazz."
56:35;56:41;"So this guy now has like 15 copies of the vinyl for a Love Supreme."
56:41;56:46;"For every time someone goes in there, I got to get my friend who likes jazz something."
56:47;56:52;"His name is Farmer Bill. I'm known as the jazz farmer of the Eaton, Ohio area."
56:52;56:55;"I'm one of many farmers. Everybody knows I love jazz."
56:55;57:05;"I play tenor saxophone. And this Christmas, I received eight copies of a Love Supreme by John Coltrane from eight different people."
57:05;57:09;"That's what happens when you're the jazz farmer in the area."
57:09;57:14;"They cleaned out Walmart. It could happen."
57:15;57:19;"And it's a shame, too, because there's so many other albums I don't have yet. I don't have Giant Steps."
57:19;57:24;"I don't have my favorite things. They just keep giving me a Love Supreme over and over again."
57:24;57:31;"On my list, I was really hoping for this very rare Japanese reissue of Eric Dolphy live."
57:31;57:35;"But everybody always gives me John Coltrane, a Love Supreme."
57:35;57:39;"Guys, you think I don't have that? You kidding me?"
57:39;57:43;"[Jazz music]"
57:43;57:48;"[Jazz music]"
57:48;57:56;"[Jazz music]"
57:56;58:12;"[Jazz music]"
58:12;58:36;"[Jazz music]"
58:36;58:40;"I'm trying to think of, like, what are the most random baseball teams."
58:41;58:42;"Florida Marlins comes to mind."
58:42;58:45;"Milwaukee Brewers. Seems real deep."
58:45;58:48;"We're probably just offending somebody who's like, ""That's my team."""
58:48;58:53;"Kansas City Royals? Kansas City Royals, Hackney Diamonds?"
58:53;58:58;"I think that's the first example I came up with. I was just like, ""What's a deep team?"""
58:58;59:01;"I've never fully accepted the Diamondbacks or the Marlins."
59:01;59:05;"Have there been new teams since then, Matt?"
59:05;59:07;"Tampa Bay."
59:08;59:09;"Buccaneers?"
59:09;59:11;"Tampa Bay and Arizona are the two newest."
59:11;59:13;"The Buccaneers are the baseball team."
59:13;59:15;"Oh, double-rays."
59:15;59:17;"Yeah, they're the Rays now."
59:17;59:19;"Just the Rays, not the double-rays."
59:19;59:22;"Marlins, Rays are pretty random."
59:22;59:24;"Tampa with a baseball team? Too deep."
59:24;59:27;"Didn't they throw in a—did they throw in a Canada team? I can't remember."
59:27;59:30;"Well, there used to be the Montreal Expos who left."
59:30;59:32;"The Expos."
59:32;59:34;"Well, the Expos after the Expos. I thought they had another—"
59:34;59:36;"Blue Jays."
59:37;59:38;"They went back. They went back to back."
59:38;59:44;"Well, you know, it's a famous team, but it's pretty random because now that they changed their name, it's the Guardians."
59:44;59:46;"The Cleveland Guardians."
59:46;59:50;"They were getting some heat for their previous name, the Cleveland—"
59:50;59:52;"They changed their name?"
59:52;59:54;"I didn't know that."
59:54;59:56;"When did that happen?"
59:56;59:58;"I guess I'm the only baseball junkie here."
59:58;01:00:00;"That's a terrible name. The Guardians?"
01:00:00;01:00:05;"Oh, yeah. Ezra's not joking around. They really did it."
01:00:06;01:00:07;"What's the team's name referenced to?"
01:00:07;01:00:10;"Guardians of the Galaxy, I think. It's kind of a hot movie."
01:00:10;01:00:21;"No, the team's name referenced the Guardians of Traffic, eight monolithic 1932 art deco sculptures by Henry Herring on the City's Hope Memorial Bridge."
01:00:21;01:00:23;"Okay."
01:00:23;01:00:25;"Which is adjacent to Progressive Field, Jake."
01:00:25;01:00:28;"I just don't like it. Yeah, I just think of the Guardians of the Galaxy."
01:00:28;01:00:33;"No, I get it. They had to change the name, but wait, were there some other runners-up?"
01:00:34;01:00:36;"Were there other cool names they considered?"
01:00:36;01:00:38;"I think it's pretty cool."
01:00:38;01:00:40;"That maybe were too spicy or something?"
01:00:40;01:00:45;"The new team logo is pretty cool. It's got a baseball with wings on it and a G."
01:00:45;01:00:49;"Oh, Spiders? They wanted to be Spiders?"
01:00:49;01:00:52;"Yes, I knew there was a Cleveland Spiders."
01:00:52;01:00:54;"That's kind of cool."
01:00:54;01:00:56;"It's better."
01:00:56;01:00:58;"Wait, Municipals?"
01:00:58;01:01:00;"Terrible."
01:01:00;01:01:02;"Better than Guardians."
01:01:03;01:01:06;"You're going to love this. Rockers. The Cleveland Rockers."
01:01:06;01:01:08;"Oh, like because of the Hall of Fame?"
01:01:08;01:01:10;"Yeah."
01:01:10;01:01:12;"I like it better than Guardians."
01:01:12;01:01:16;"What was the Drew Carey show? It was like, ""Cleveland Rocks."""
01:01:16;01:01:18;"Oh, the Cleveland Rocks?"
01:01:18;01:01:24;"Or also, you know how one of the newest hockey franchises is the Seattle Kraken?"
01:01:24;01:01:26;"Oh, yeah."
01:01:26;01:01:32;"And it was interesting to me that it's not a plural noun. It's just the Seattle Kraken."
01:01:32;01:01:37;"And Cleveland had an opportunity to really just flex on them and do something different."
01:01:37;01:01:40;"Every single Major League team ends with an S."
01:01:40;01:01:45;"They could have been like, ""The Cleveland Experience."""
01:01:45;01:01:52;"Or ""The Cleveland,"" I don't know, ""The Cleveland."""
01:01:52;01:01:55;"Just some kind of abstract singular noun."
01:01:55;01:01:59;"But I think you're saying something interesting in general."
01:02:00;01:02:03;"Maybe you're supposed to—it refers to all the players and not the mascot."
01:02:03;01:02:08;"But even if you were the Cleveland Bear, it just sounds better."
01:02:08;01:02:10;"It sounds hard."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"Yeah, definitely sounds hard."
01:02:12;01:02:19;"Remember we were talking about that trend in coastal urban areas for restaurants that are kind of like sentences?"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"""Burgers never say die."""
01:02:21;01:02:23;"Yes."
01:02:23;01:02:25;"""Burger,"" she wrote."
01:02:25;01:02:27;"""Burger,"" she wrote. And there are some other good ones."
01:02:27;01:02:29;"The Cleveland Burger."
01:02:29;01:02:30;"The Cleveland Burger."
01:02:30;01:02:33;"What about the dogs? The Cleveland dogs. That'd be cool."
01:02:33;01:02:35;"That's pretty sick."
01:02:35;01:02:37;"Or just the Cleveland dog."
01:02:37;01:02:42;"What about—okay, go with the Cleveland Meat because it sounds like meat cleaver."
01:02:42;01:02:45;"Oh, I like that. Or the Cleveland Cleavers."
01:02:45;01:02:47;"Oh, yeah, the Cleavers."
01:02:47;01:02:52;"I mean, honestly, the Cleveland Meat Cleavers sounds good, too."
01:02:52;01:02:56;"But what about some far-out thing like the Cleveland Welcome to Clevelands?"
01:02:57;01:03:03;"Just some kind of like trippy thing where you're kind of using like—what's the motto of Cleveland? The city motto?"
01:03:03;01:03:05;"What about ""The Cleveland Welcomes You""?"
01:03:05;01:03:07;"Yes."
01:03:07;01:03:12;"Kind of like—basically like a small-time psychedelic band from the late '60s."
01:03:12;01:03:14;"""The Cleveland Welcomes You."""
01:03:14;01:03:18;"That's pretty good. ""Progress and Prosperity"" is the motto."
01:03:18;01:03:22;"""The Cleveland Progress and Prosperity."" Or just ""The Cleveland Prosperity."""
01:03:22;01:03:24;"Yeah, ""The Cleveland Prosperity"" is pretty good."
01:03:25;01:03:29;"""Ladies and gentlemen, we're The Cleveland Prosperity. We're very excited to play some baseball for you tonight."""
01:03:29;01:03:41;"And then just some—then just some like—some loser walks out and is like, ""Oh, yeah, we're the Milwaukee Brewers."""
01:03:41;01:03:43;"Boo! So boring."
01:03:43;01:03:52;"""Ladies and gentlemen, we're The Cleveland Prosperity. And tonight we're going to play this game called baseball."""
01:03:53;01:03:54;"Anyway."
01:03:54;01:03:59;"That is a great band name. ""The Cleveland Prosperity"" is epic."
01:03:59;01:04:02;"You know, actually, I know a guy who works for the Guardians."
01:04:02;01:04:04;"Really?"
01:04:04;01:04:09;"He's a friend of a friend. He's a great guy. I always liked him. I'm not going to blow up his spot."
01:04:09;01:04:17;"And actually, that's probably why I know a bit about this because I remember talking to him and I was like, ""Whoa, what was this name change like?"""
01:04:18;01:04:24;"And he was like, ""Oh, bro, it was crazy. You know, tell me the—no joke, the inside baseball take on the name change."""
01:04:24;01:04:29;"And it was, of course, was like high stakes. And they couldn't—they had to be really careful."
01:04:29;01:04:32;"They didn't pick another name they had to change. That would have been a disaster."
01:04:32;01:04:38;"So, yeah, just dealing with all that stuff and making sure that nobody else had the name and all that stuff,"
01:04:38;01:04:42;"it sounded like a stressful moment for the organization."
01:04:43;01:04:48;"But I think they gave the Guardians a shot. Nobody likes it. Let's go for ""The Cleveland Prosperity."""
01:04:48;01:04:51;"We've already tested it. People are excited about it."
01:04:51;01:04:58;"You know, I'm from a—I think the only city where every one of my professional team names has been changed."
01:04:58;01:05:00;"Oh, Washington, D.C.?"
01:05:00;01:05:02;"Yeah, break it down."
01:05:02;01:05:04;"You used to have the Senators, right?"
01:05:04;01:05:11;"I didn't—used to have a base—yes, used to have the Senators, but that was—and I think as an organization, they ended in—basically, my team was Baltimore,"
01:05:12;01:05:14;"but if I had just been a bit older, they would have had the Senators."
01:05:14;01:05:17;"Then they brought the team back, became the Nationals for baseball."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"Wait, so you're saying the Senators were like a long time ago."
01:05:20;01:05:27;"The Senators were—yes, yes. But just so you—but yes, so that one I feel like less of a connection to."
01:05:27;01:05:33;"But growing up, it was the Senators, but then they did bring them back while I was there, and they became the Nationals."
01:05:33;01:05:37;"So you consider that a name change. We just had—we had no team for a minute."
01:05:38;01:05:43;"Yeah, so there's the Ottawa Senators, too. Did Ottawa Canada take over the name, or is that—?"
01:05:43;01:05:56;"I thought it just sort of shuttered. But then my basketball team was the Bullets, and because D.C. was the crime capital of the world, you know, that was the murder capital through the '80s."
01:05:56;01:05:58;"Not the world, the U.S."
01:05:58;01:06:05;"No, no, no, no. They would say it was the murder capital. I mean, growing up, look at it. I mean, whether it was or was not, I know it's an exaggeration."
01:06:05;01:06:06;"Yeah."
01:06:07;01:06:08;"But it was the murder capital. It was the murder capital."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"No, I remember it had a bad—"
01:06:10;01:06:13;"So they said Bullets, Bad Rap, and they'd change—"
01:06:13;01:06:15;"Wait, what sport were the Bullets?"
01:06:15;01:06:16;"Basketball."
01:06:16;01:06:18;"That's crazy. They changed it to the Wizards?"
01:06:18;01:06:26;"The Wizards, which I remember also being like, this is—I mean, anybody that went from the hard Bullets to the Wizards, like, no one was happy with that."
01:06:26;01:06:29;"Why can't these people come up with decent names? Oh, my God."
01:06:30;01:06:44;"And then I just looked this up because I actually—and then obviously the Washington Redskins, which make the Cleveland Indians look incredibly progressive, had really held onto that name for a really long time."
01:06:44;01:06:51;"And to the point where I actually—during this conversation I looked up, I thought they were still called the Redskins, but no one wanted to say the name."
01:06:51;01:06:53;"Did the Redskins ever get a new name?"
01:06:53;01:06:55;"They just did, it looks like."
01:06:55;01:06:58;"Because they were just called the Washington Football Team or something."
01:06:59;01:07:08;"Yes, we would just—people just would call—because my brother is a huge fan of Washington, and you would just say, ""I'm rooting for Washington or the Washington Football Team."""
01:07:08;01:07:09;"Oh, my God."
01:07:09;01:07:15;"And sort of, you just couldn't say it. And now it looks like it's the Washington Commanders."
01:07:15;01:07:17;"Oh, yeah. So the Commanders—"
01:07:17;01:07:18;"I mean, this is—"
01:07:18;01:07:19;"The Wizards."
01:07:19;01:07:20;"This is awful to me."
01:07:20;01:07:21;"Yeah."
01:07:21;01:07:25;"The Wizards, yeah. And Nationals."
01:07:25;01:07:27;"These are all terrible names."
01:07:28;01:07:29;"We've lost them all."
01:07:29;01:07:34;"Now, obviously, Cleveland should have called themselves the Cleveland Bullets. It was up for grabs."
01:07:34;01:07:40;"You know, Cleveland is probably not as dangerous as D.C. was in that era."
01:07:40;01:07:44;"The Cleveland Bullets, yeah, we hit the ball faster than a bullet."
01:07:44;01:07:51;"Oh, are you promoting violence? No, we just hit the baseball faster than the bullet right out of the park. Home run."
01:07:51;01:07:57;"We're the Cleveland Bullets. It's a great name, and you know that people like it."
01:07:57;01:08:00;"Yeah, the Washington Commanders is also very ominous."
01:08:00;01:08:02;"Commander."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"It's like a Handmaid's Tale, right?"
01:08:04;01:08:05;"Yeah."
01:08:05;01:08:06;"They have commanders."
01:08:06;01:08:12;"Yeah, they should have had a little more fun or specific, like the Admirals would have been better."
01:08:12;01:08:13;"The Washington Admirals."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"Yep."
01:08:14;01:08:17;"The Washington—even the Colonels would have been better."
01:08:17;01:08:22;"What about like, oh, you know, be sick, like, name it after a former president, like the Clintons?"
01:08:22;01:08:24;"The Washington Clintons."
01:08:24;01:08:26;"That would have gone—people would have loved that."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"The Washington Obamas."
01:08:28;01:08:31;"[Laughter]"
01:08:31;01:08:32;"That's pretty good, right?"
01:08:32;01:08:35;"Oh, come on. It should have been the Washington Monuments."
01:08:35;01:08:36;"Oh, yeah."
01:08:36;01:08:39;"Or back to my singular idea, the Washington Monument."
01:08:39;01:08:46;"Just bring a big inflatable Washington Monument with you when you go to another city."
01:08:46;01:08:48;"Just the guys run out. It's hard."
01:10:25;01:10:36;"I've just been told that, which wouldn't be terrible, but that the commanders—the team's just sold, so now they might be like, ""That name was whack, and we're going to change that name again."""
01:10:36;01:10:40;"How do you build a brand this way? This is insane."
01:10:40;01:10:48;"Please, whoever buys the Washington football team, please consider the Washington Monument, or even better, just something kind of fun."
01:10:48;01:10:51;"What'd you say? The Washington Oklahomas?"
01:10:51;01:10:52;"[Laughter]"
01:10:52;01:10:54;"Just get crazy with it."
01:10:54;01:11:05;"What about, yeah, just like an animal name? Like the foxes, the dogs, you know, something kind of cute. Like, you know, there's the cubs."
01:11:05;01:11:08;"I've always liked the name, like, the Dirty Dogs."
01:11:08;01:11:10;"The Washington Dirty Dogs?"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"Yeah."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"The Washington Dog—yeah."
01:11:12;01:11:13;"Like the trashers."
01:11:13;01:11:20;"The Washington Dogs. Yeah, because also just like, own it. Just be like the messy bad boys."
01:11:21;01:11:25;"What about something vulgar? Something vulgar. Oh, like, ""Sh*t, we're a f*ck."""
01:11:25;01:11:28;"The Washington Sh*t."
01:11:28;01:11:30;"[Laughter]"
01:11:30;01:11:32;"I don't know. I'm sort of liking that."
01:11:32;01:11:35;"The Washington team name cannot be televised."
01:11:35;01:11:40;"I'm sort of liking Ezra's The Washington Messy Bad Boys."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"[Laughter]"
01:11:41;01:11:44;"We're the messy bad boys, and we're here to say."
01:11:45;01:11:57;"Or, I love the trippy idea, too. What's the name of the Lana Del Rey album? Did You Know There's a Tunnel Underneath Ocean Boulevard?"
01:11:57;01:12:06;"There's a lot of did you knows you could come up with about D.C. Like, aren't there—isn't there like a weird train system for the senators that goes underground?"
01:12:06;01:12:11;"The Washington Did You Know That There's a Weird Train System Underground for the Senators to Use."
01:12:12;01:12:17;"The Washington Did You Know That Thomas Jefferson Laid This City Out with Masonic Symbols."
01:12:17;01:12:26;"The Washington—The Washington Did You Know You Don't Actually Have to Pay Your Income Tax Because the Federal Reserve is a Private Company?"
01:12:26;01:12:30;"[Laughter]"
01:12:30;01:12:40;"I'm telling you, make the Washington football team's name a question, you will go down in history as the coolest football team of all time."
01:12:41;01:12:49;"Break the mold. Do something original. I would love to just give a sports team a crazy name."
01:12:49;01:13:00;"It is—it is wild that no one's done it. There hasn't been some just like psycho billionaire that's bought a team that's been like, let's just—who cares?"
01:13:00;01:13:09;"Well, I'm sure you probably get a lot of static from Roger Goodall. You know, these people don't want change."
01:13:10;01:13:16;"I mean, honestly, I even think in the NHL, I was surprised that they got away with the Seattle Kraken."
01:13:16;01:13:22;"Like, it wouldn't be shocking if somebody had come down from the NHL and just said, guys, it's got to be a plural."
01:13:22;01:13:24;"What is the Kraken?"
01:13:24;01:13:32;"That's the Seattle NHL team. And, you know, a Kraken is a mythological beast that's like a giant squid that would take down boats."
01:13:32;01:13:34;"That's cool."
01:13:35;01:13:47;"I mean, could he—I was thinking about what Signpo was saying that, you know, like the guy that created Minecraft has just bought Cleveland and he's named it the F*** You's."
01:13:47;01:13:49;"You know?"
01:13:49;01:13:52;"Yeah. It's like, I mean, it's kind of like Crypto.com Arena."
01:13:52;01:13:55;"Yeah. The Cleveland F*** You's."
01:13:55;01:14:00;"I just thought of another one. If anybody hates this discussion, I'm sorry."
01:14:00;01:14:02;"F*** you, Arena."
01:14:03;01:14:09;"Also, you know how, like, there's so many great countries that have an ""and"" like Turks and Caicos?"
01:14:09;01:14:11;"Trinidad and Tobago."
01:14:11;01:14:24;"Trinidad and Tobago. If one had an ""and"" in it, that'd be sick. Like, well, it could have been the Washington Master and Commanders or, you know, the Washington Dogs and Cats."
01:14:24;01:14:27;"Or Cats and Dogs."
01:14:27;01:14:29;"The Apples and Oranges."
01:14:29;01:14:31;"The Washington Apples and Oranges."
01:14:32;01:14:38;"What if it was the other way? What if it was two cities collabing with a single team name?"
01:14:38;01:14:47;"You know, adjacent states or not, both of them—neither one of them can afford their own full team. They collab."
01:14:47;01:14:53;"Now you've got the Chicago and Las Vegas. That'd be pretty sick."
01:14:53;01:15:01;"Yeah, totally. Or what if you created just like the most hated team of all time? That was the New York and LA."
01:15:01;01:15:10;"Like, the New York and LA elites. And the whole thing about the team is like, introducing the first bi-coastal team."
01:15:10;01:15:18;"And it's like, are you a businessman, a movie producer? And you're fine just spending half your time in New York, half your time in LA."
01:15:18;01:15:24;"Aren't you sick of missing Dodgers or Yankees games? You don't know which way is up. Well, we got the team for you."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"The coastal elites."
01:15:26;01:15:29;"The coastal—the bi-coastal elites."
01:15:30;01:15:39;"The first—the world's first baseball team that has equal—an equal footprint in both cities."
01:15:39;01:15:42;"In the two best cities in America."
01:15:42;01:15:51;"The two best—the absolute best cities. And they build an identical arena in both places. The menu in the VIP club is exactly the same."
01:15:52;01:16:01;"So if you're—if you're like the business guy, it's like, you always can—oh, and also they play every game twice."
01:16:01;01:16:06;"So you never miss one."
01:16:06;01:16:13;"The first one they play normally and then the second one they kind of like recreate. Anyway, you go to your same seat."
01:16:13;01:16:19;"The parking lot's exactly the same. They got the exact same food in the lounge. And your loyalty is no longer split."
01:16:20;01:16:23;"What's that bi-coastal elite menu looking like in the lounge?"
01:16:23;01:16:26;"You're getting like a chocolate fountain. Uh-huh."
01:16:26;01:16:29;"Uh, martinis. Oh, yeah."
01:16:29;01:16:34;"I've definitely—definitely like Wagyu burgers and truffle fries. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now we're talking."
01:16:34;01:16:37;"And a chopped salad. Yeah, yeah."
01:16:37;01:16:43;"A $40 Caesar salad. Fancy tacos."
01:16:43;01:16:47;"Oh, Peter Luger, like a nice like Peter Luger steak. Yeah."
01:16:48;01:16:57;"Really fancy tacos. And you ask, ""Is it possible to get the carne asada taco without the mango chutney?"" No."
01:16:57;01:17:02;"No, it's all made off-site."
01:17:02;01:17:08;"The chef—the chef made this decision a long time ago."
01:17:08;01:17:13;"I'm actually kind of allergic to— No, no substitution."
01:17:14;01:17:18;"Lobster. Is it possible to get a chicken taco without the lobster? No."
01:17:18;01:17:20;"What's the corkage fee?"
01:17:20;01:17:27;"You'll have to have the mushroom taco. There's obviously a vegan option."
01:17:27;01:17:30;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. They got a great risotto."
01:17:30;01:17:37;"I love the coastal elite. I mean, in some ways, we're coming full circle. I hadn't thought about it in years."
01:17:38;01:17:50;"When we asked our listeners for some of their like bits they remembered from when we were doing kind of our 200th episode, one was when we did Lord Hattington."
01:17:50;01:17:52;"Who would like brush the home plate off."
01:17:52;01:17:55;"His butler would come out and brush the plate off."
01:17:55;01:18:01;"Because clearly we spent a lot of time on this show trying to make sports more interesting."
01:18:02;01:18:10;"And we felt maybe at the time it seemed like baseball was slipping. So we were trying to create WWE type characters who have a backstory."
01:18:10;01:18:14;"So you need a heel. And like, ""Oh, here comes the fancy boy."""
01:18:14;01:18:21;"You could picture something like that in WWE. The Rock is like, ""What'd you say?"" And the guy's like, ""I said my dad could buy you."""
01:18:21;01:18:25;"And then he's like, ""What?"" And he grabs him and body slams him. And this would be the same thing."
01:18:26;01:18:32;"Lord Hattington's like the kind of rich guy heel. But anyway, he could play for the bi-coastal elites."
01:18:32;01:18:34;"Oh, big time."
01:18:34;01:18:36;"And he comes out."
01:18:36;01:18:38;"No trade cloths."
01:18:38;01:18:40;"He comes out in like a Patrick Bateman kind of suit."
01:18:40;01:18:42;"They just wear straight up suits."
01:18:42;01:18:45;"In a Valentino straight Valentino pins-drive suit."
01:18:45;01:18:53;"Also, the team, they do go between the New York and LA identical stadiums. But outside of that, they don't play away games."
01:18:54;01:18:56;"Oh, right. You have to go to them."
01:18:56;01:18:58;"You come to them."
01:18:58;01:19:01;"I like this. All the Bat-Boys are dressed like butlers."
01:19:01;01:19:08;"I have an idea. No kids allowed."
01:19:08;01:19:10;"Oh, yeah. No kids."
01:19:10;01:19:14;"No children. Classy adult affair. Right? We don't need that."
01:19:14;01:19:20;"Yeah, there's like a hot tub section. Like out in right field."
01:19:21;01:19:27;"Some dad brings their kid to the ball game and the guy in the tiki-kia goes, ""I'm so sorry."""
01:19:27;01:19:29;"""I'm sorry, sir."""
01:19:29;01:19:31;"No children allowed."
01:19:31;01:19:34;"Also, there's a sharing fee for popcorn."
01:19:34;01:19:41;"Gotta be. Oh, what are those bags that Dave Chappelle makes you put your phone into?"
01:19:41;01:19:43;"Oh, yonder."
01:19:43;01:19:46;"Yonder bags."
01:19:46;01:19:48;"Yonder bags."
01:19:48;01:19:50;"Yonder. Yeah. Yonder policy."
01:19:50;01:19:52;"This is very exclusive, this game."
01:19:52;01:19:57;"There's a little bit of an Alamo Draft House kind of vibe to it."
01:19:57;01:19:59;"Respectful."
01:19:59;01:20:02;"You gotta sign an NDA to go to the game."
01:20:02;01:20:06;"You know what also I've never actually seen?"
01:20:06;01:20:14;"Because people talked about how the new Yankee Stadium was actually a bit smaller and it was made more for the VIPs."
01:20:15;01:20:23;"But one, if you just looked out at like a full half of a baseball stadium and it was all double wide, like first class airline seats."
01:20:23;01:20:29;"I thought you were going to say this baseball stadium sits 400 people."
01:20:29;01:20:30;"That too."
01:20:30;01:20:37;"This is huge, huge, huge stadium."
01:20:37;01:20:38;"All boxes."
01:20:38;01:20:42;"There's only seats behind. The only seats are behind on the plate."
01:20:42;01:20:43;"Everybody gets a couch."
01:20:44;01:20:45;"It's all boxes."
01:20:45;01:20:46;"Yeah."
01:20:46;01:20:50;"I think we're onto something."
01:20:50;01:20:51;"We're onto something."
01:20:52;01:20:57;"Spring wind blows this time each year."
01:20:57;01:21:03;"A fresh breeze, the hummingbirds are here."
01:21:03;01:21:09;"From Mexico, they ride the northern winds."
01:21:09;01:21:15;"Away up to Alaska and back down again."
01:21:17;01:21:21;"Their feet are pawing like a bee."
01:21:21;01:21:27;"Nature's helicopters so stationary."
01:21:27;01:21:34;"Can they hover way up in the sky?"
01:21:34;01:21:40;"Or do they remain tethered by their size?"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"Spring wind."
01:21:44;01:21:47;"Watch the grass start to grow."
01:21:47;01:21:48;"Spring wind."
01:21:48;01:21:53;"See the mangrove out exposed."
01:21:53;01:21:54;"Spring wind."
01:21:54;01:21:59;"Hear the rustle of the leaves."
01:21:59;01:22:00;"Spring wind."
01:22:00;01:22:05;"Of the Yucca luscious trees."
01:22:32;01:22:36;"In the yard, they come to build a nest."
01:22:36;01:22:42;"Take a little breather and catch a bit of rest."
01:22:42;01:22:49;"From the feeder, it's a tonic that they drink."
01:22:49;01:22:55;"Some refined sugar and water from our sink."
01:22:55;01:22:56;"Spring wind."
01:22:56;01:23:01;"Watch the grass start to grow."
01:23:01;01:23:02;"Spring wind."
01:23:02;01:23:07;"See the mangrove out exposed."
01:23:07;01:23:08;"Spring wind."
01:23:08;01:23:14;"Hear the rustle of the leaves."
01:23:14;01:23:15;"Spring wind."
01:23:15;01:23:20;"Of the Yucca luscious trees."
01:23:20;01:23:22;"Alright, what should we do?"
01:23:22;01:23:23;"Top five?"
01:23:23;01:23:26;"It's time for the top five."
01:23:26;01:23:30;"F-F-F-F-F-Five on iTunes."
01:23:30;01:23:35;"This week on the top five, we're going to be comparing the top five hits of 1964"
01:23:35;01:23:38;"with the top five Apple music songs of today."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"Why 1964?"
01:23:40;01:23:41;"I think I actually know."
01:23:41;01:23:44;"Is that when the Rolling Stones' first album came out?"
01:23:44;01:23:45;"I'm going to assume so."
01:23:45;01:23:48;"Which was called the Rolling Stones."
01:23:48;01:23:49;"It's the second album."
01:23:49;01:23:52;"Was called England's newest hit makers?"
01:23:52;01:23:53;"That also rules."
01:23:53;01:23:55;"How come nobody does anything like that?"
01:23:55;01:23:59;"Billie Eilish's second album is called America's newest hit maker?"
01:24:00;01:24:01;"That would rule."
01:24:01;01:24:03;"Okay, number five."
01:24:03;01:24:05;"Oh, this is interesting."
01:24:05;01:24:10;"This is billed as Roy Orbison and the Candymen with Oh Pretty Woman."
01:24:10;01:24:13;"I'm a huge Orb head."
01:24:13;01:24:14;"Are you?"
01:24:14;01:24:16;"I love, oh, I love Roy Orbison."
01:24:16;01:24:20;"You mean like, do you know his catalog deeply?"
01:24:20;01:24:24;"Not crazy well, but there's about ten songs I listen to constantly."
01:24:24;01:24:27;"So like, I'm that kind of fan."
01:24:27;01:24:28;"Yeah."
01:24:28;01:24:31;"I go so deep on a bunch of his music."
01:24:31;01:24:35;"His version of Love Hurts, I listen to all the time."
01:24:35;01:24:36;"Oh, wow."
01:24:36;01:24:43;"I remember this song."
01:24:43;01:24:49;"Oh, I was going to ask if this was on your Orbison playlist."
01:24:49;01:24:51;"Or is this just too kind of ubiquitous already?"
01:24:51;01:24:53;"It's great."
01:24:53;01:24:54;"I don't listen to it that much."
01:24:54;01:24:56;"When I was a kid, I loved this."
01:24:57;01:25:02;"And I remember one time I went to one of the early songs I wrote was at my grandma's house."
01:25:02;01:25:10;"She would always have these small bagels that came in a pre-packaged in a bag, like from the supermarket."
01:25:10;01:25:20;"And I wrote a song that went, like, it's hard to sing it over the part, the bridge of the song."
01:25:21;01:25:23;"Pretty woman, talk a while."
01:25:23;01:25:29;"Pretty woman, give your smile to me."
01:25:29;01:25:34;"Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:25:34;01:25:38;"Pretty woman, look my way."
01:25:38;01:25:40;"Pretty woman, say your name."
01:25:40;01:25:43;"Were you stoked when the Wilburys came out?"
01:25:43;01:25:44;"Or maybe you were too young."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"I didn't clock it."
01:25:45;01:25:46;"I had to go backwards."
01:25:46;01:25:48;"You were like five when that came out."
01:25:48;01:25:51;"I'll treat you right."
01:25:51;01:25:55;"Come with me, baby."
01:25:55;01:25:59;"Be mine tonight."
01:25:59;01:26:00;"It's a long bridge."
01:26:00;01:26:06;"Did you do that part once?"
01:26:06;01:26:10;"Oh, yes. So my song went, little bagel."
01:26:10;01:26:13;"I think it was little bagel walking down the street."
01:26:13;01:26:16;"Little bagel, the type I'd want to eat or something."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Anyway, I was into Pretty Woman."
01:26:19;01:26:21;"It was like your Weird Al version of it."
01:26:21;01:26:22;"Yeah."
01:26:22;01:26:32;"I've been doing a Weird Al version recently of Phil Collins' One More Night with my daughter."
01:26:32;01:26:37;"If she's eating, I'll go, give me one more bite."
01:26:37;01:26:40;"One more bite."
01:26:40;01:26:42;"Because I can't wait forever."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"I can't wait forever."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"We've got to wrap this up."
01:26:46;01:26:48;"Someday I'll play her the original."
01:26:48;01:26:49;"It's going to blow her mind."
01:26:49;01:26:51;"Dad, I thought you wrote that."
01:26:51;01:27:04;"It's the all-time classic."
01:27:04;01:27:11;"The number five song this week on Apple Music is Jelly Roll with Laini Wilson, Save Me."
01:27:13;01:27:14;"Jelly Roll?"
01:27:14;01:27:16;"Is this more country?"
01:27:16;01:27:17;"I know Jelly Roll."
01:27:17;01:27:24;"Okay, so Jelly Roll, aka Jason Bradley Defford, is a rapper and singer-songwriter from Antioch, Tennessee."
01:27:24;01:27:30;"At 14 years old, he was arrested and charged with multiple counts of marijuana possession and attempted robbery."
01:27:30;01:27:35;"It's funny they call him a rap- I really think of him only as a country singer."
01:27:35;01:27:38;"But he's got an interesting look."
01:27:39;01:27:41;"He's really a country singer."
01:27:41;01:27:48;"With sort of a post-face tattoos."
01:27:48;01:27:55;"Kind of giving me a Chris Cornell vibe."
01:27:55;01:27:57;"That's cool."
01:27:57;01:27:59;"With the Southern flan."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"He's going to Stagecoach in April."
01:28:10;01:28:14;"And Jelly Roll's big on."
01:28:14;01:28:18;"He's on the big stage."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"Is Zach Bryan playing?"
01:28:21;01:28:23;"He's not."
01:28:23;01:28:25;"Morgan Wallen's playing."
01:28:25;01:28:28;"Post Malone's there doing a country set."
01:28:28;01:28:30;"Wow."
01:28:30;01:28:35;"Nick, I feel like you've really come into your own with contemporary country the past year."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I have."
01:28:37;01:28:39;"I've always been sort of very low-key into it."
01:28:39;01:28:41;"It's come up whenever a Morgan Wallen or something."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"But yes, I feel like in the last year I've gotten a bit deeper."
01:28:44;01:28:51;"And I think Zach Bryan has certainly been a sort of a gateway drug for a lot of people."
01:28:51;01:28:56;"But yeah, it definitely feels like the mood of the moment."
01:28:56;01:29:05;"But you're right, this actually does feel almost more like Chris Cornell."
01:29:06;01:29:07;"Well, the verses did."
01:29:07;01:29:15;"Yeah, but I'm saying his voice, his quality is like in other stuff I've heard of this guy, it's straight up country."
01:29:15;01:29:17;"Here's Lainey Wilson."
01:29:17;01:29:21;"Again, this is one of these total downer, bummer country songs."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"It's like a big hit. I don't understand it."
01:29:23;01:29:26;"It's like cathartic emotional music for people."
01:29:26;01:29:29;"I guess maybe that's what more people are looking for."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"I guess so."
01:29:31;01:29:35;"I'm sure if we dug through the country charts we'd still find some beer and trucks music."
01:29:35;01:29:42;"Dude, I'm telling you, one of my favorite songs and one of my new guys is this guy Ian Munsic."
01:29:42;01:29:45;"And he's got a song called ""Cow S*** in the Morning""."
01:29:45;01:29:47;"Oh yeah, you sent it to us."
01:29:47;01:29:53;"He's working in a slightly more upbeat tempo that I think you guys respond to."
01:29:53;01:29:55;"So that's really what I'm looking for for you guys."
01:29:55;01:29:59;"You know, I mean, I'm a fan of the art of the beautiful ballad."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"This stuff is such like..."
01:30:01;01:30:03;"Yeah, I don't like this vibe."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"It's such like... it's so..."
01:30:05;01:30:08;"I don't think I'm... I'm not listening to this."
01:30:08;01:30:11;"Just to be very clear, this is not something I'd be listening to."
01:30:11;01:30:13;"It's cool, man."
01:30:13;01:30:15;"It's just not what we're looking for."
01:30:15;01:30:17;"Maybe this will brighten the mood."
01:30:17;01:30:22;"The number four song this week in 1964, Gail Garnett with ""We'll Sing in the Sunshine""."
01:30:22;01:30:26;"I don't know Gail Garnett."
01:30:26;01:30:29;"She's a New Zealand-born Canadian artist."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"She stopped recording music in the 80s but would occasionally act,"
01:30:33;01:30:35;"including in my Big Fat Greek Wedding."
01:30:35;01:30:47;"They won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording in 1965."
01:30:47;01:30:51;"Do you think they still give out the Grammy for Best Folk Recording?"
01:30:51;01:30:54;"There probably is some kind of contemporary folk."
01:30:54;01:30:57;"""The cost of love's too dear."
01:30:57;01:31:01;"But though I'll never love you,"
01:31:01;01:31:05;"I'll stay with you one year,"
01:31:05;01:31:07;"and we can sing in the sunshine."""
01:31:07;01:31:09;"This is also very Sleeping Beast to me."
01:31:09;01:31:11;"This has a kind of a creepy element though."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"It's not that folky."
01:31:13;01:31:17;"""We'll sing in the sunshine."""
01:31:17;01:31:19;"This is the kind of thing they play in a..."
01:31:19;01:31:21;"Folk pop."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"In Righteous Gemstones?"
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Yes, maybe."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"But only when something really bad is happening."
01:31:28;01:31:30;"Like someone's about to get a gun being pulled out."
01:31:30;01:31:33;"This would be a really violent moment in Righteous Gemstones."
01:31:33;01:31:35;"Yes, exactly."
01:31:35;01:31:37;"Alright, let's keep moving."
01:31:37;01:31:39;"Number 4 song, contemporary."
01:31:39;01:31:44;"It's Nick's Boy, Zach Bryan with ""I Remember Everything"" featuring Casey Musgraves."
01:31:44;01:31:47;"I don't think this is what we're trying to listen to right now."
01:31:47;01:31:49;"No, you're not."
01:31:49;01:31:51;"This is a sad song."
01:31:51;01:31:52;"But it's a sad song."
01:31:52;01:32:00;"Did I mention to you guys personally,"
01:32:00;01:32:03;"or over text or on the show, I can't remember,"
01:32:03;01:32:06;"that he was on Rogan?"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"And he was basically saying that,"
01:32:08;01:32:10;"because you guys were like, ""We need the barn burner."""
01:32:10;01:32:13;"Oh, I actually did send you, that guy Ian Munsick has a song called ""Barn Burner."""
01:32:13;01:32:15;"That's what I sent you."
01:32:15;01:32:17;"Is that you said you wanted a barn burner,"
01:32:17;01:32:19;"and he was like, ""Guys, I got barn burners,"
01:32:20;01:32:21;"but I want an audience that keeps"
01:32:21;01:32:24;"driving the sadder songs up the charts."""
01:32:24;01:32:28;"He's like, ""I like energy."""
01:32:28;01:32:30;"People are sad."
01:32:30;01:32:32;"And so you guys were right."
01:32:32;01:32:35;"I think that he's certainly,"
01:32:35;01:32:38;"it's the audience that I think is driving this tone."
01:32:38;01:32:40;"Interesting."
01:32:40;01:32:42;"And he was very open about it,"
01:32:42;01:32:45;"because I think maybe Rogan said something similar to us,"
01:32:45;01:32:47;"or to you guys,"
01:32:47;01:32:49;"and then he was like, ""No, no, I get it."""
01:32:49;01:32:51;"But it's, I got those on an album."
01:32:51;01:32:53;"I have a 32 song album or whatever,"
01:32:53;01:32:56;"and there's a big, you know, there are barn burners,"
01:32:56;01:32:59;"but it's not what that audience is asking me to play."
01:32:59;01:33:01;"I'm sure like when he sings this,"
01:33:01;01:33:03;"it's like a huge moment in the show."
01:33:03;01:33:05;"It's not like, ""Let's go get a beer,"
01:33:05;01:33:07;"and wait for the barn burners."""
01:33:07;01:33:09;"This probably is a centerpiece type thing."
01:33:09;01:33:11;"Yeah."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"Well, in some bands, when they play their ballads,"
01:33:13;01:33:15;"everyone's like, ""Well, it's time to go get a beer."""
01:33:15;01:33:17;"Yeah, not him."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"It's a little bit of a culture shift."
01:33:46;01:33:49;"I believe he did tweet that he wanted to make a Midwest punk rock album."
01:33:49;01:33:51;"Oh, yeah. I heard about that."
01:33:51;01:33:53;"A Midwest emo record."
01:33:53;01:33:55;"Yeah."
01:33:55;01:33:57;"But even that would probably be more of the ballady,"
01:33:57;01:33:59;"like emotional side."
01:33:59;01:34:01;"But, wait, actually, pause this for a second."
01:34:01;01:34:03;"I just have a question."
01:34:03;01:34:05;"Can you play the Johnny Cash ""Hurt""?"
01:34:05;01:34:07;"Isn't there an ""I remember everything"" line in this?"
01:34:07;01:34:09;"Yeah, I think he says it really slowly."
01:34:09;01:34:11;"""I remember."""
01:34:11;01:34:13;"Yeah, of course, the Nine Inch Nails cover."
01:34:13;01:34:15;"My favorite band."
01:34:15;01:34:16;"I haven't heard from them in a while."
01:34:16;01:34:18;"Jake, you don't even like ""Hurt"" by Nine Inch Nails?"
01:34:18;01:34:21;"You don't even like ""Hurt"" when it's done by someone else?"
01:34:21;01:34:23;"Not really."
01:34:23;01:34:26;"I mean, I like ""Hurt"" more than a lot of other Nine Inch Nails,"
01:34:26;01:34:28;"but no, not a fan."
01:34:28;01:34:30;"The Washington Hurt Locker."
01:34:30;01:34:33;"That'd be a crazy name for a D.C. football team."
01:34:33;01:34:35;"That's super heavy."
01:34:35;01:34:37;"Super intense."
01:34:37;01:34:39;"Let's bring some gravitas to sport."
01:34:48;01:34:53;"I hurt myself today"
01:34:53;01:34:58;"To see if I still feel"
01:34:58;01:35:03;"I focus on the pain"
01:35:05;01:35:09;"The only thing that's real"
01:35:09;01:35:14;"The needle tears a hole"
01:35:14;01:35:19;"The old familiar sting"
01:35:19;01:35:24;"Try to kill it all away"
01:35:24;01:35:29;"But I remember everything"
01:35:29;01:35:31;"So it's kind of like the same vibe, like,"
01:35:31;01:35:34;"""I remember everything, but I wish I didn't."""
01:35:34;01:35:36;"You've become"
01:35:36;01:35:41;"My sweetest friend"
01:35:41;01:35:46;"Everyone I know"
01:35:46;01:35:51;"Goes away in the end"
01:35:51;01:35:56;"And you could have it all"
01:35:56;01:36:01;"My empire of dirt"
01:36:02;01:36:06;"I will let you down"
01:36:06;01:36:11;"I will make you hurt"
01:36:11;01:36:14;"I wonder if somewhere in Zach Brine's mind,"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"I remember everything is not like the most original phrase,"
01:36:17;01:36:19;"but I wonder if somewhere in the recesses of his mind,"
01:36:19;01:36:24;"this song and that line played some role."
01:36:24;01:36:26;"Okay."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"The number three song in 1964,"
01:36:30;01:36:32;"J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers,"
01:36:32;01:36:34;"""Last Kiss."""
01:36:34;01:36:36;"I always love this song."
01:36:36;01:36:38;"Mm-hmm."
01:36:38;01:36:41;"I always like this kind of music,"
01:36:41;01:36:45;"so I remember when the Pearl Jam cover came out in '99,"
01:36:45;01:36:47;"and I was like 15, I was like,"
01:36:47;01:36:49;"""Oh, yeah, 'Last Kiss.'"""
01:36:49;01:36:51;"I was very familiar with the song."
01:36:51;01:36:53;"Oh, same here, yeah."
01:36:53;01:36:55;"I remember just thinking, ""That's the most awkward choice"
01:36:55;01:36:57;"that Pearl Jam made."""
01:36:57;01:36:59;"It was the time for them."
01:36:59;01:37:01;"I was like, ""Why did they cover this song?"""
01:37:01;01:37:05;"We were out on a date in my daddy's car"
01:37:05;01:37:08;"We hadn't driven very far"
01:37:08;01:37:12;"There in the road, straight ahead"
01:37:12;01:37:15;"The car was tall, the engine was dead"
01:37:15;01:37:17;"I couldn't stop"
01:37:17;01:37:19;"So this was originally re-recorded and released"
01:37:19;01:37:21;"by Wayne Cochran in '61,"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"and this is the cover."
01:37:23;01:37:25;"But this is crazy."
01:37:25;01:37:27;"While on tour in Ohio, J. Frank Wilson"
01:37:28;01:37:30;"and band members Son Lee Roosh fell asleep at the wheel."
01:37:30;01:37:32;"The car drifted into another lane,"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"struck a trailer truck head-on."
01:37:34;01:37:36;"Roosh was killed."
01:37:36;01:37:38;"Some of the other guys survived with serious injuries."
01:37:38;01:37:40;"And they're big hits about a car crash."
01:37:40;01:37:44;"She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good"
01:37:44;01:37:47;"So I can see my baby when I leave"
01:37:47;01:37:50;"Can you throw in that Pearl Jam version?"
01:37:50;01:37:55;"Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?"
01:37:56;01:37:59;"The Lord took her away from me"
01:37:59;01:38:03;"She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good"
01:38:03;01:38:09;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world"
01:38:09;01:38:16;"We were out on a date in my daddy's car"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"We hadn't driven very far"
01:38:19;01:38:22;"So think about that, going, ""We were out on a date!"""
01:38:23;01:38:26;"I also thought it was so mismatched,"
01:38:26;01:38:29;"like the 50s, kind of teeny-bopper ballad"
01:38:29;01:38:32;"with like the intense medium."
01:38:32;01:38:34;"The streets did not agree with you."
01:38:34;01:38:38;"I'll never forget the sound that night"
01:38:38;01:38:42;"The screaming tires, the busting glass"
01:38:42;01:38:44;"The painful screams"
01:38:44;01:38:46;"I just, I could never take it seriously."
01:38:46;01:38:48;"I thought it was the funniest thing."
01:38:51;01:38:55;"Oh, where, oh, where can my baby be?"
01:38:55;01:38:59;"The Lord took her away from me"
01:38:59;01:39:03;"She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good"
01:39:03;01:39:09;"So I can see my baby when I leave this world"
01:39:09;01:39:11;"Okay."
01:39:11;01:39:13;"Alright, we get the idea."
01:39:13;01:39:17;"I'm good. Confirmed. It's still terrible."
01:39:18;01:39:21;"By the early 60s, it was still relatively,"
01:39:21;01:39:24;"like teenagers driving around in cars"
01:39:24;01:39:28;"was still some pretty, like, a cutting-edge experience."
01:39:28;01:39:32;"Like I know, you know, people had cars from the teens and the 20s."
01:39:32;01:39:36;"But like, by the early 60s, then you really have, you know,"
01:39:36;01:39:39;"suburbia, people borrowing their dad's car."
01:39:39;01:39:44;"You know, that wasn't happening in like 1930s New York City."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"And probably not even in the farmland,"
01:39:47;01:39:49;"but by the early 60s, mass production of the automobile."
01:39:49;01:39:51;"This probably was like a very new experience."
01:39:51;01:39:54;"Going out on a date to the malt shop."
01:39:54;01:39:56;"In a car, and then something bad happens."
01:39:56;01:39:59;"And it's like, there probably were a lot of people who were like,"
01:39:59;01:40:01;"I can't believe, wow, that happened."
01:40:01;01:40:03;"And your parents probably were like,"
01:40:03;01:40:05;"I can't believe this is what's happening now."
01:40:05;01:40:07;"Kids drive around in these death traps."
01:40:07;01:40:09;"When we were their age, who knows?"
01:40:09;01:40:12;"Some of them might even have been riding horses,"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"depending where they're from."
01:40:15;01:40:18;"If you had a kid in 1961, who's like 16,"
01:40:18;01:40:23;"so they would have been born in like 1945."
01:40:23;01:40:27;"And let's say you were born in like, let's say 1920."
01:40:27;01:40:29;"Yeah."
01:40:29;01:40:32;"So if you were going to go on a date when you were 16,"
01:40:32;01:40:34;"it would have been 1936."
01:40:34;01:40:36;"It was the depression. You weren't going on a date."
01:40:36;01:40:38;"No."
01:40:38;01:40:40;"Certainly not borrowing dad's car to drive somewhere."
01:40:40;01:40:42;"Yeah."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"I guess I'm just saying,"
01:40:44;01:40:47;"would anybody write a song about a car crash today?"
01:40:47;01:40:49;"No."
01:40:49;01:40:51;"I guess the same way that getting ghosted"
01:40:51;01:40:57;"is like a cutting edge experience for a young person."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"The last car crash song I can think of is"
01:41:00;01:41:02;"Airbag Saved My Life."
01:41:02;01:41:05;"First track on OK Computer."
01:41:05;01:41:07;"And then there's Through the Wire,"
01:41:07;01:41:09;"Kanye's first single about a car crash."
01:41:09;01:41:11;"Oh, that's true. That's a great song."
01:41:12;01:41:13;"I'm not sure about it."
01:41:13;01:41:15;"The number three song,"
01:41:15;01:41:17;"and also Airbag Technology Got Better."
01:41:17;01:41:20;"The number three song this week,"
01:41:20;01:41:23;"and I believe this is the number one song on Billboard,"
01:41:23;01:41:25;"is Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer."
01:41:25;01:41:27;"And what's interesting about this song"
01:41:27;01:41:30;"is it came out four or five years ago"
01:41:30;01:41:33;"and the Eras Tour renewed interest in it."
01:41:33;01:41:35;"So this is not a re-record?"
01:41:35;01:41:37;"No, this is an old song."
01:41:37;01:41:40;"Not because of TikTok, just because of the tour."
01:41:41;01:41:42;"I played some role."
01:41:42;01:41:44;"But yeah, I think starting with the tour."
01:41:44;01:41:57;"I think she was supposed to have released this"
01:41:57;01:42:02;"as a single right before the global COVID-19 pandemic."
01:42:02;01:42:05;"Oh, so it didn't really get its moment."
01:42:05;01:42:07;"Yeah, exactly."
01:42:08;01:42:11;"It's one of those fan deep cut types of songs"
01:42:11;01:42:13;"that they always wanted to release."
01:42:13;01:42:19;"St. Vincent has a writing trend on this song."
01:42:19;01:42:21;"That granny."
01:42:21;01:42:31;"She's trying times."
01:42:31;01:42:33;"She's getting a new deck."
01:42:33;01:42:37;"We have just a joke in Vampire Weekend"
01:42:37;01:42:38;"about one time,"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"it was like a show, maybe wasn't going to happen,"
01:42:40;01:42:43;"and somebody we worked with was trying to build a new deck."
01:42:43;01:42:46;"They weren't pressuring us to do the show or anything."
01:42:46;01:42:48;"We just remember this idea of just like,"
01:42:48;01:42:50;"well, someone's got to pay for that new deck."
01:42:50;01:42:52;"When the money's rolling and you build a new deck,"
01:42:52;01:42:54;"it's what you do."
01:42:54;01:42:56;"That's a good name for an album."
01:42:56;01:42:58;"New deck?"
01:42:58;01:43:01;"By the way, that's what the Rolling Stones' next album should be called."
01:43:01;01:43:03;"New deck?"
01:43:03;01:43:05;"Yeah, it's just like, hey guys."
01:43:06;01:43:07;"Just new deck."
01:43:07;01:43:09;"They're like, well, that has nothing thematically"
01:43:09;01:43:12;"to go with any of the songs on the record."
01:43:12;01:43:14;"It's a double meaning too."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"It could be Mick is standing on his new deck."
01:43:16;01:43:20;"He's sitting in an Adirondack chair on his new deck,"
01:43:20;01:43:23;"but he's also opening a brand new pack of cards"
01:43:23;01:43:25;"with a glint in his eye."
01:43:25;01:43:27;"Ooh."
01:43:27;01:43:29;"New deck."
01:43:29;01:43:32;"It does have like my favorite Ron Wood record."
01:43:33;01:43:35;"I've got my own album to do."
01:43:35;01:43:37;"Oh yeah."
01:43:37;01:43:39;"That's sort of like new deck."
01:43:39;01:43:42;"We weren't going to make an album,"
01:43:42;01:43:46;"but Ronnie said he needed to build a new deck."
01:43:46;01:43:48;"Right."
01:43:48;01:43:50;"Ron's got like three songs."
01:43:50;01:43:52;"We can kind of just fill out the rest of this record."
01:43:52;01:43:54;"Ron has ""Mystify Me."""
01:43:54;01:43:56;"That's a great song."
01:43:56;01:43:59;"Far East Asian Man, or whatever that one's called."
01:43:59;01:44:01;"Not as strong."
01:44:02;01:44:03;"[laughter]"
01:44:03;01:44:05;"It's just..."
01:44:05;01:44:07;"The new album."
01:44:07;01:44:09;"Termites f***ed up my deck."
01:44:09;01:44:13;"And it's just like a picture of Mick on the old f***ed up deck."
01:44:13;01:44:15;"And he's like pulling his pockets out of his pants"
01:44:15;01:44:17;"like an old school pauper."
01:44:17;01:44:19;"Or just like, ""Come on."
01:44:19;01:44:21;"I need a new deck."""
01:44:21;01:44:23;"[laughter]"
01:44:23;01:44:25;"There's something to me too about like..."
01:44:25;01:44:27;"I also just love the new deck"
01:44:27;01:44:31;"as like a kind of shorthand for somebody came into money."
01:44:31;01:44:32;"Because..."
01:44:32;01:44:34;"Because it's like a car, a house."
01:44:34;01:44:36;"It's too obvious."
01:44:36;01:44:38;"I like the more modest,"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"""Oh, they're getting a new deck."""
01:44:40;01:44:42;"It'd be like beating some investor who's just like,"

01:44:46;01:44:48;"I'm about to be a billionaire."""
01:44:48;01:44:50;"Just like, ""Sounds like you're getting a new deck."""
01:44:50;01:44:52;"It's like, ""Yeah, I'm getting a lot more than that."
01:44:52;01:44:55;"Invite me over when you finish the deck."
01:44:55;01:44:58;"I would love to hang on the new deck."""
01:44:58;01:45:00;"Number two song."
01:45:00;01:45:01;"Oh, it's a Grateful Dead cover."
01:45:01;01:45:03;"A song that... Sorry."
01:45:03;01:45:05;"It's a song that the Grateful Dead love to cover."
01:45:05;01:45:08;"It's Martha and the Vandellas with Dancing in the Street."
01:45:22;01:45:25;"They only covered this earlier in their career, right?"
01:45:25;01:45:27;"They were covering it in the 70s."
01:45:27;01:45:29;"Oh, really?"
01:45:29;01:45:31;"Is there a version of it on Shakedown Street?"
01:45:31;01:45:33;"Is there? I don't remember that."
01:45:33;01:45:35;"Let me get a number crunch."
01:45:35;01:45:37;"I think there's a studio version of Dancing in the Street."
01:45:37;01:45:39;"Really? Maybe on Trippin'."
01:45:39;01:45:41;"We got to do an ABM."
01:45:41;01:45:43;"They were playing it at Cornell '77, for instance."
01:46:59;01:47:01;"Is this on Shakedown Street?"
01:47:01;01:47:04;"No? What is this on?"
01:47:04;01:47:07;"Cornell 5877."
01:47:07;01:47:11;"On Shakedown Street, there's a studio version of Good Lovin'."
01:47:11;01:47:12;"Oh, that's what I'm thinking of."
01:47:12;01:47:14;"Pretty funny."
01:47:14;01:47:19;"So the Dead never did a studio version of Dancing in the Street."
01:47:47;01:47:49;"Yeah, you're right. They were playing it in the 60s."
01:47:49;01:47:53;"The versions I know, I guess I know this version."
01:47:53;01:47:55;"Maybe I usually kind of skip this one."
01:47:55;01:48:02;"The versions I know are the really early Grateful Dead shows where they played it."
01:48:08;01:48:10;"Oh, wait a second."
01:48:10;01:48:12;"I'm not as off as I thought."
01:48:12;01:48:14;"There is a studio version of Dancing in the Street."
01:48:15;01:48:17;"It's track two on Terrapin Station."
01:48:17;01:48:19;"So random."
01:48:19;01:48:21;"That is really deep."
01:48:21;01:48:24;"Track one, Estimated Profit. Track two, Dancing in the Street."
01:48:24;01:48:27;"Yeah, I was off by one album."
01:48:27;01:48:32;"Yeah, I don't know Terrapin or Shakedown particularly well as records."
01:48:32;01:48:38;"It's funny. There's not a lot of music on it because the Terrapin suite takes up all the side too."
01:48:38;01:48:40;"Yeah."
01:48:41;01:48:46;"There's a pretty random Donna song called Sunrise that I think it's very possible they never performed."
01:48:46;01:48:50;"Estimated Profit, obviously like major song."
01:48:50;01:48:53;"And then Passenger and Samson and Delilah. That's the whole album."
01:48:53;01:48:55;"That's a pretty rough record."
01:48:55;01:48:58;"That might be the low point for me."
01:49:05;01:49:08;"I like the energy of this recording."
01:49:10;01:49:14;"I'd even prefer Go to Heaven to Terrapin."
01:49:14;01:49:17;"What do you feel about the song Terrapin Station?"
01:49:17;01:49:19;"I love the beginning of it."
01:49:19;01:49:22;"And then it just kind of goes off the rails a little bit for me."
01:49:22;01:49:26;"That first chunk is so beautiful though."
01:49:26;01:49:28;"[singing]"
01:49:28;01:49:30;"Are you a fan of Terrapin?"
01:49:30;01:49:32;"Yeah, I love that guitar."
01:49:32;01:49:34;"You love it."
01:49:34;01:49:36;"And I know what you mean. The beginning is so beautiful."
01:49:36;01:49:38;"Yeah."
01:49:38;01:49:39;"It's tough with..."
01:49:39;01:49:41;"Throw in the beginning of Terrapin, please."
01:49:41;01:49:47;"It's tough like if like a 15 minute song, if like the first three minutes is like the best part."
01:49:47;01:49:49;"Yeah."
01:49:49;01:49:51;"It's kind of tough to listen to."
01:49:51;01:49:55;"It's one of Jerry's great melodies, that first chunk of Terrapin."
01:49:55;01:50:00;"Yeah, I would say that this section is like actually a hugely important..."
01:50:00;01:50:03;"The lyrics, it's very special."
01:50:03;01:50:07;"Nothing sounds like this. I can't think of any other music that sounds like this to me."
01:50:07;01:50:08;"[singing]"
01:50:08;01:50:24;"Just that mystical, but down to earth, dead vibe."
01:50:24;01:50:26;"Mm-hmm."
01:50:26;01:50:32;"Great vocal performance here too."
01:50:32;01:50:34;"[singing]"
01:50:35;01:50:36;"[singing]"
01:51:03;01:51:05;"I wonder how long Jerry worked on this song for."
01:51:05;01:51:08;"Right."
01:51:08;01:51:13;"If he just like, was like, ""Oh my God, I've just been up all night for the last week, like writing this song."""
01:51:13;01:51:17;"Or if he was like, ""I started this actually a year ago and I've been like tinkering with it."""
01:51:17;01:51:20;"Mm. You know, it's hard to say."
01:51:20;01:51:22;"Yeah."
01:51:22;01:51:24;"All right, we got to keep moving."
01:51:24;01:51:26;"We got to wrap this show up."
01:51:26;01:51:29;"Although I will say, I don't know if we're going to get to it, but there's that classic stanza."
01:51:30;01:51:31;"[singing]"
01:51:31;01:51:40;"Just these like, great little moments in the song."
01:51:40;01:51:43;"All right. Keeping on moving."
01:51:43;01:51:48;"Maybe Vampire should cover Terrapin. That'd be ambitious as all hell."
01:51:48;01:51:50;"[singing]"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"Yeah, maybe do all 17 minutes."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"They didn't always do the whole song anyway."
01:51:54;01:51:56;"They do the first couple parts."
01:51:56;01:51:58;"Yeah, we could just tuck that into something."
01:51:59;01:52:00;"All right. Okay."
01:52:00;01:52:02;"Where are we at? Number two?"
01:52:02;01:52:07;"We got the Kid LAROI, Jung Kook, and Central C with ""Too Much."""
01:52:07;01:52:10;"This is the first single for the Kid LAROI's album."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"So, you know, Jung Kook is from BTS."
01:52:14;01:52:20;"Who's Kid LAROI?"
01:52:20;01:52:23;"He's like an Australian guy."
01:52:23;01:52:26;"He had a big hit with Bieber called ""Stay."""
01:52:27;01:52:31;"You could almost say, reductively, he's an Australian Bieber."
01:52:31;01:52:34;"Yeah. He's like a pop star. Okay."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"Yeah."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"With a little post in him."
01:52:38;01:52:40;"With some tattoos."
01:52:40;01:52:42;"Some face tats?"
01:52:42;01:52:44;"No face tats."
01:52:44;01:52:46;"Face tats?"
01:52:48;01:52:51;"I feel like I saw, I don't know if it was like a comedian or something."
01:52:51;01:52:53;"Someone was doing a bit about like,"
01:52:54;01:52:58;"imagine when the first judges have face tats."
01:52:58;01:53:02;"Or like, if you go into your doctor's office and it's sort of like,"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"""Oh yeah, I want to meet my new doctor."
01:53:04;01:53:08;"Dr. Tyler's here."""
01:53:08;01:53:10;"Dr. Face Tat."
01:53:10;01:53:13;"Dr. Face Tat. He just comes in, he's this spider web."
01:53:13;01:53:16;"He's just like, ""Uh."""
01:53:16;01:53:18;"Yeah."
01:53:18;01:53:21;"Just as his little forehead says, ""Forgiveness."""
01:53:21;01:53:23;"You're like, ""Uh."""
01:53:24;01:53:26;"I don't know why this is making me a little uncomfortable."
01:53:26;01:53:30;"One of the nation's most renowned cardiac surgeons."
01:53:30;01:53:32;"Justin."
01:53:32;01:53:34;"Some face tat."
01:53:34;01:53:36;"Justin's face tat."
01:53:36;01:53:38;"It's going to happen."
01:53:38;01:53:40;"Yeah."
01:53:40;01:53:42;"The Washington face tats?"
01:53:42;01:53:44;"Ooh."
01:53:44;01:53:46;"The Washington tats?"
01:53:46;01:53:51;"The number one song in 1964 this week, ""Man for Demand"" with Dua Didi."
01:53:52;01:53:53;"Another great song."
01:53:53;01:54:03;"So Man for Demand's had a weird career."
01:54:03;01:54:06;"Yeah, he made it through all the eras."
01:54:06;01:54:09;"He's the dude that did the Springsteen cover, right?"
01:54:09;01:54:11;"""Blinded by the Light""?"
01:54:11;01:54:13;"Yeah."
01:54:13;01:54:14;"Is that Man for Demand?"
01:54:14;01:54:15;"Well, he always had like, different bands."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"This song also reminds me a lot of ""Pretty Woman."""
01:54:23;01:54:26;"They're both about women walking down the street."
01:54:26;01:54:33;"Oh wait, hold on."
01:54:33;01:54:37;"Man for Demand was a band named after their keyboardist Man for Demand,"
01:54:37;01:54:42;"who later led the successful 1970s group Man for Demand's Earth Band."
01:54:42;01:54:44;"Okay."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"So Man for Demand's not the singer."
01:54:46;01:54:48;"It's a good name, Man for Demand."
01:54:49;01:54:50;"Yeah."
01:54:50;01:54:53;"The Cleveland Man for Demand's Earth Band."
01:54:53;01:54:57;"Okay, that's pushing it, Nick. That's pushing it."
01:54:57;01:55:03;"The Cleveland Man for Demand's Earth Band."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"I love it."
01:55:05;01:55:08;"They're English, too. I wouldn't have guessed that."
01:55:35;01:55:38;"Wait a second. Did they not do the Springsteen song? Or am I thinking of someone else?"
01:55:38;01:55:40;"No, that's Man for Demand's Earth Band."
01:55:40;01:55:43;"Okay. It might have been a different singer."
01:55:43;01:55:46;"And they had that—oh yeah, they did ""Mighty Quinn,"" too, right."
01:56:11;01:56:16;"The last song we're listening to today is Paul Russell with ""Lil Boothing."""
01:56:18;01:56:21;"Paul Russell, the rapper from Los Angeles."
01:56:29;01:56:31;"Wow, this doesn't feel like it's from 2023."
01:56:31;01:56:33;"No."
01:56:35;01:56:37;"Did they have a song this famous?"
01:56:37;01:56:39;"I don't know."
01:56:39;01:56:41;"This is just like—"
01:56:41;01:56:45;"This just feels like it'd be from 2003."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Yeah."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Or 1998 or something."
01:56:48;01:56:51;"Anyway, we'll let you decide what you think about this one."
01:56:51;01:56:54;"Playing us out, it's Paul Russell with ""Lil Boothing."""
01:56:54;01:56:56;"We'll see you guys in two weeks."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Thanks for listening."
01:58:09;01:58:13;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:58:13;01:58:15;"Hey Nig!"
01:58:15;01:58:17;"(siren wailing)"
