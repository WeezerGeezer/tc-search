00:02;00:04;"Alice in Chains"
00:04;00:07;"Horse meat sashimi"
00:07;00:10;"It's a very 90s episode of time crisis"
00:10;00:15;"We got some great guests and some great conversation"
00:15;00:19;"Stick around you're not gonna want to miss this one"
00:19;00:22;"here on"
00:22;00:25;"Crisis with Ezra Koenig"
00:25;00:27;"*music*"
00:35;00:53;"All of those great romances, they were all felt lovingly. All my rightful chances, my picture clear. Everything seemed so easy."
00:53;01:15;"And so I dealt you the blow. One of us had to go. Now it's different, I want you to know. One of us is crying. One of us is lying. Leave it on me babe."
01:15;01:25;"Time crisis back again. How many time zones are we in today? I'm in the Japanese countryside. You got three guys in LA and we got Matt in Brooklyn."
01:25;01:33;"Oh, you're not still on Martha's Vineyard, Jake? No, I bounced. I bounced yesterday. Flew back. Welcome back. Thank you. Feels great to be back."
01:33;01:39;"You're spiritually West Coast. Dipped through Boston very briefly because we flew out of Logan. Oh, how was that?"
01:39;01:45;"I haven't been there a long time. I'll keep it quick because we have a call that we have to get to very quickly. Yes."
01:45;01:53;"We ate lunch at the Rock Bottom Brewery in Boston. Maybe we could circle back to that. I'd love to hear about the Rock Bottom Brewery."
01:53;01:59;"Let's just table that. Not at the airport? No, no. It was in downtown Boston, which is even weirder."
01:59;02:07;"I would love to just walk you through our whole like kind of two hour adventure in Boston. In real time. But we have two hours."
02:07;02:10;"Well, OK. Let's just scratch the itinerary for the show."
02:10;02:23;"OK. But yeah, we're about to get a friend of the show, Alex Gordelis, on to tell us about how somehow time crisis figures into this NBA scandal, which I know very little about."
02:23;02:28;"Boston Celtics, actually. So. Oh, Boston Celtics. Right. Head coach being suspended."
02:28;02:35;"Yeah. When I was in Martha's Vineyard, I got a bunch of texts from Alex. He's basically like, has this crossed your desk?"
02:35;02:45;"The head coach has been suspended for a year. The story broke on Twitter about an hour before it did officially from this obscure account that only follows 34 people."
02:45;02:50;"And they couldn't figure out who this person was that broke the story early."
02:50;02:57;"And they follow 34 people and they follow me, you, Seinfeld and the official time crisis account. Sorry, Nick."
02:57;03:02;"I don't think you were in the mix on this one, but you will be shortly."
03:02;03:09;"I better be. You know, I'm still pumpkin spice latte. Official accounts still won't accept my I don't even know what you call it."
03:09;03:15;"My submission to follow them. My request to follow. That's horse crap."
03:15;03:20;"Yeah. Anyway, so there's some deep secret TC head that broke this."
03:20;03:23;"That's also very connected to the Celtics organization."
03:23;03:27;"And we'll get Alex on the phone just to explain this to us."
03:27;03:33;"Yeah, because I remember I was like waking up in Japan, seeing like a bunch of texts about the economic heads or tails of it."
03:33;03:40;"And I didn't even put it together later that the coach that I guess there's this whole other element that he was married to the famous actress Nia Long."
03:40;03:51;"OK, news to me. So we're never getting her on time crisis now. Now, let's go to the time crisis hotline."
03:51;03:56;"Hey, guys. Hey, what's up, Alex? Welcome back to the show. Thank you for having me back."
03:56;04:04;"I was just trying to catch the boys up on this whole backstory of you texting me of all this, you know, has this crossed your desk yet?"
04:04;04:07;"Do you know what's going on? Let me just try to summarize quickly."
04:07;04:15;"Just tell me if this is right. Head coach of the Celtics suspended for having an inappropriate relationship,"
04:15;04:19;"a fair something with somebody who worked at the organization. He suspended."
04:19;04:24;"On top of that, he's married to the actress Nia Long."
04:24;04:30;"So there's this whole other element of people being dismayed that he would violate the sanctity of their marriage."
04:30;04:37;"So this is a big news story because the Celtics are a major organization in the National Basketball Association."
04:37;04:41;"So he's a famous coach. If you follow basketball, this guy's famous."
04:41;04:44;"Extremely. He was a he was a first year coach last year."
04:44;04:50;"And then you took the Celtics to the finals in his first season as a coach, which was incredible."
04:50;04:53;"Oh, so this is bad timing for Boston. Yeah."
04:53;04:59;"Boston's got a young team. They've got this hot coach who's in his first season, almost took them to win the title."
04:59;05:06;"And then the scandal, it blows up and breaks up the team a little bit or sets the team back for sure."
05:06;05:09;"Oh, dear. OK, so now I understand the magnitude of it, because, yeah,"
05:09;05:12;"at first I was hearing like coach of the Celtics suspended."
05:12;05:16;"And, you know, if you don't follow basketball that closely, at first I was like, who gives a ****?"
05:16;05:19;"Yeah, the specifics of the allegations weren't what caught my interest."
05:19;05:23;"I mean, it is a one year suspension, which is pretty unprecedented for a coach."
05:23;05:26;"And the details of the allegations, they're not out there yet entirely."
05:26;05:30;"So people don't know what we're talking about."
05:30;05:36;"Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But what caught my attention was, is the story obviously came out of nowhere."
05:36;05:41;"There's an ESPN reporter, Adrian Wojnarowski, who goes by Woj."
05:41;05:48;"His thing is that he drops big NBA news stories on Twitter and those tweets are called Woj bombs."
05:48;05:53;"So, yeah, he dropped a Woj bomb a week ago last Wednesday that this was happening."
05:53;06:00;"Twitter freaks out. But then people pointed to a tweet that predated the Woj bomb by one hour."
06:00;06:04;"A burner account beat him to the story by one hour."
06:04;06:07;"Ah, OK. So I'm starting to understand this better."
06:07;06:12;"So not only was this a big story and this burner account, because even something happening an hour early,"
06:12;06:16;"sometimes you're almost like, well, OK, maybe they read something somebody else didn't read."
06:16;06:21;"I don't know. But now I understand that when Woj drops a Woj bomb."
06:21;06:25;"Yes. A big part of it is that he got the story first."
06:25;06:32;"He always gets it first. So this is a really big deal that this burner account beat the Woj bomb."
06:32;06:36;"It's historic. I mean, to beat Woj to a Woj bomb."
06:36;06:39;"I don't recall something like that happening. Him getting scooped by a burner."
06:39;06:47;"And so immediately all the Boston sports world focuses on this burner and starts throwing around, you know, guesses as to who this could be."
06:47;06:50;"Is it a member of the Celtics who didn't like the coach?"
06:50;06:53;"Is it somebody from an opposing team like Kevin Durant plays on the Nets?"
06:53;06:58;"He famously has a lot of burner accounts. So a lot of people are like, is this Kevin Durant?"
06:58;07:03;"Is this the spouse of somebody on the Celtics? So there's all these wild guesses going around."
07:03;07:06;"I think of myself as somewhat of an Internet detective."
07:06;07:11;"So I'm like, I want to look into this. And this tweet that broke the story is blowing up."
07:11;07:17;"And I go to look at the account and the burner account follows 34 people."
07:17;07:20;"So I'm like, oh, I can look at who they follow to get a better sense of who this is."
07:20;07:24;"Is it KD? Is it a Celtics player? So I click on who this burner follows."
07:24;07:31;"And the first names that pop up are @Dongstreath."
07:31;07:34;"This is for Canic. Time Crisis. Seinfeld 2000 in winter."
07:34;07:39;"I was like, oh, in winter? The burner is a deep TC head."
07:39;07:44;"I'm like, whoever is behind this is a TC head."
07:44;07:47;"And yet they don't follow me. Yeah, they will."
07:47;07:52;"They will. And so, yeah, I was, you know, to me, because everyone is guessing like,"
07:52;07:56;"yeah, is it somebody on the Celtics? And so it's like, clearly it's a TC head."
07:56;08:00;"I don't know if there's an NBA player who listens to TC."
08:00;08:07;"Not that we know. There's no chance that it's someone who's separately a fan of Starbucking,"
08:07;08:10;"painting, and Vampire Weekend. Wait, hold on."
08:10;08:14;"Wait, I just realized, I just realized who it is. It's Nick."
08:14;08:20;"That's why, oh damn, it was you? That's why Nick, the call was coming from inside the house."
08:20;08:24;"His name was Nick too. Oh, it was you."
08:24;08:28;"Now we know from a couple episodes ago that Nick is a deep state operative"
08:28;08:31;"and he has a lot of connections in the national security agencies."
08:31;08:35;"He used to work at the Pentagon. So, of course, he could beat a Woj bomb."
08:35;08:40;"Imagine. The one thing I never thought was to follow myself."
08:40;08:45;"And that I was really undone because I just didn't think to follow myself."
08:45;08:49;"Oh, I love this. It's like Columbo. Oh, it's just one more thing."
08:49;08:57;"Why did that account not follow you, Mr. Weidenfeld?"
08:57;09:02;"Last night I met a woman. You recognized her name."
09:02;09:07;"Who in our conversation told me you were her old flame."
09:07;09:13;"Well, I didn't want to listen, but as she told me more,"
09:13;09:17;"I learned more about you than I ever knew before."
09:17;09:24;"You're keeping too many secrets from me."
09:24;09:29;"But baby, now I'm wise too."
09:29;09:34;"You fool me like the others. And I know what you'll do."
09:34;09:40;"You'll find yourself a new love and give me a secret too."
09:40;09:43;"So in a way, as you look through all these people,"
09:43;09:46;"the fact that there were four or five TC related accounts,"
09:46;09:52;"this actually might be the biggest clue for an Internet detective out of all these accounts."
09:52;09:55;"It's a huge clue. And yeah, the other things somebody found,"
09:55;10:01;"and I can't verify this, but this burner account posted a receipt to a donation to Nithya Raman,"
10:01;10:07;"who's an L.A. politician. And so then people started to make very specific guesses as to who it could be."
10:07;10:10;"I don't want to name names, but some of these people were friends of mine"
10:10;10:14;"who were being guest as behind the burner account."
10:14;10:16;"They were kind of freaked out by how much attention this was getting."
10:16;10:20;"Sorry, what did the account actually tweet? They just said, big story about to drop."
10:20;10:22;"It was a kind of a cryptic tweet."
10:22;10:27;"It was if there's one person who will never get fired for sleeping around, it's M.A. Udoka."
10:27;10:32;"So they're accurate and that he didn't get fired. The accusation was that he was sleeping around."
10:32;10:37;"So it was very cryptic, but like specific at the same time."
10:37;10:41;"So that almost sounds insider-y because it would be one thing if somebody heard,"
10:41;10:48;"oh, the coach of the Celtics got in trouble. Then you could just tweet coach of the Celtics, big story coming."
10:48;10:51;"They even knew that he wouldn't be fired. I guess that could be a guess,"
10:51;10:56;"but that almost sounds like somebody who is aware of the decision the organization made already."
10:56;11:01;"Right. Like kind of deep. Yeah, this is a TC head with top-level Boston Celtics intel."
11:01;11:05;"Yeah, it's an egg. Could this be a coincidence?"
11:05;11:08;"Like somebody just earnestly loves this coach"
11:08;11:13;"and was just like keeping praise on their integrity kind of thing?"
11:13;11:17;"That thought did cross my mind. Is this coincidence?"
11:17;11:23;"That you would put like one hour before this major story drops? And also this account doesn't post much?"
11:23;11:27;"Doesn't post that often. The previous tweet was something about Mitzke and Weezer."
11:27;11:32;"So that to me immediately ruled out like a Kevin Durant or a best Celtics player."
11:32;11:36;"So they seem like they're interested in indie rock, rock and roll, basketball."
11:36;11:39;"They seem to be a fan of the Denver Nuggets, interestingly."
11:39;11:46;"So there's a few clues out there. They have not. You sure that Kevin Durant is not a Mitzke or Weezer fan?"
11:46;11:53;"Actually, I stand corrected. I've seen Kevin Durant will practice like wearing a Pearl Jam t-shirt or a Kurt Cobain t-shirt."
11:53;11:57;"So he's into rock and roll for sure. So it could be. I won't rule it out."
11:57;12:03;"He likes the Blue Album. Yeah, he tapped out after that."
12:03;12:07;"This account hasn't tweeted since they broke this story."
12:07;12:10;"So to me, like obviously this person is a TC head."
12:10;12:15;"They're probably listening right now. So to me, it's like just send up some kind of signal"
12:15;12:23;"like to confirm. So they're trying to. I mean, do you get the sense that it's important to them that they maintain their secrecy?"
12:23;12:27;"Unclear. Are people still digging into trying to figure out who this person is or?"
12:27;12:31;"Well, yeah, maybe at this point they are just freaked out. You're saying your other friends got freaked out."
12:31;12:36;"Maybe that they don't want the whole. And also as I put it together over the weeks,"
12:36;12:42;"this is this story turned so big because obviously Boston fans are very passionate."
12:42;12:46;"Now, you've given us some much-needed context about why they're particularly passionate."
12:46;12:52;"They probably thought they were going to go to the win the finals this year if they went last year."
12:52;12:58;"But then on top of that, there's this the amount of discussion about the other side of it."
12:58;13:03;"Nia Long finding out that her husband was cheating on her in apparently in real time."
13:03;13:07;"She found out as the story broke. That created a whole storm."
13:07;13:12;"There was a sitting congressman from the Bronx, Jamal Bowman,"
13:12;13:18;"tweeting his support for her and how they should establish a national holiday to honor her."
13:18;13:22;"So this is this story. I guess it really had it all. So yeah, big story."
13:22;13:28;"So I could imagine if there's just a humble TC head who just, you know, maybe they're a hacker."
13:28;13:32;"They hacked into some of the Celtics emails or something."
13:32;13:35;"They didn't mean for it to get this big. So they probably should lay low."
13:35;13:39;"Yeah, they haven't tweeted since. You would think that if they were that freaked by it,"
13:39;13:42;"that you would delete the tweet or delete the account. They've left it up."
13:42;13:46;"Right. Somebody did some kind of reconnaissance and found out that this account,"
13:46;13:51;"before the tweet, had five followers and followed 34. Now, I think they have over 2,000 now."
13:51;13:56;"What? Wow. So who was like, how strange. And maybe it's not that deep."
13:56;14:00;"Maybe it really is like, you know, within the Celtics organization,"
14:00;14:03;"the day they're about to announce the suspension."
14:03;14:08;"By that point, you have to imagine at least like 20 or 30 people know about it."
14:08;14:12;"One of them is on the phone that morning with his cousin saying,"
14:12;14:15;"don't say anything, but pretty soon they're going to announce that the coach is getting suspended"
14:15;14:18;"and something like that. And then they're like, OK."
14:18;14:24;"To me, that's the most accurate theory. I feel like it's because this person has tweeted a lot about the Denver Nuggets."
14:24;14:29;"To me, I feel like it's somebody in Denver who probably has a cousin that works for the Celtics,"
14:29;14:31;"who sort of let it slip, like, hey, the story is going to break."
14:31;14:35;"And this guy's like, I'm going to drop this bomb on Twitter."
14:35;14:39;"Big TC head, big Mountain Brews fan. TC head making waves."
14:39;14:44;"I wonder if this person came to the Vampire Weekend show at Red Rocks and saw us perform Mountain Brews."
14:44;14:47;"I'd bet money on it. That's what they should tweet next. It's possible."
14:47;14:51;"Confirm or deny if you saw the performance of Mountain Brews."
14:51;14:58;"Oh, they might be one of those TC heads who's not a VW fan. Right. Could be. Real deep."
14:58;15:02;"As discussed, they exist."
15:02;15:07;"Sunday morning, why don't we go for a hike?"
15:07;15:13;"Meet at the trailhead light around a quarter to three."
15:13;15:18;"Me and Bobby stayed out late last night."
15:18;15:23;"Get on the trail, shake the cobwebs free."
15:23;15:29;"As we get to the top of the mountain, there's a view."
15:29;15:37;"Take a load off and crack a few Mountain Brews."
15:37;15:42;"Mountain Brews."
15:42;15:48;"Sweet Mountain Brews."
15:48;15:53;"Mountain Brews."
15:53;16:00;"Sweetest Mountain Dew."
16:00;16:03;"So what's the fallout with this story now? So who's going to be the coach now?"
16:03;16:08;"They have an interim head coach announced. I think it was an assistant coach. Blanket on his name."
16:08;16:14;"They're kind of like, yeah, not letting a lot more information out, trying to let the story lose oxygen."
16:14;16:20;"But yeah, TC had really dropped the bomb. Well, thanks for doing that."
16:20;16:23;"Or like scoop scoop for us, man. That was yeah. I said to text Jake."
16:23;16:29;"I'm like, are you aware of this? I have a, you know, like I'm on text threads with friends for NBA fans."
16:29;16:33;"Everyone's talking about it. Wow. Anything else cool happening in the sports world?"
16:33;16:39;"One more thing. Yes, there is. There's one more thing that I want to drop on you guys real quick,"
16:39;16:46;"which is that on Sunday night, NBC aired a promo for next week's Sunday night game."
16:46;16:51;"The Buccaneers versus the Chiefs. So it's Patrick Mahomes versus Tom Brady."
16:51;16:56;"Major. In the promo, they had Beck covering Old Man by Neil Young."
16:56;17:00;"I'm going to Neil Young cover bands. This caught my attention."
17:00;17:04;"It made sense to do Old Man because it has the line in the song about being 24."
17:04;17:09;"And Brady and Mahomes each both won their first Super Bowl when they were 24."
17:09;17:13;"Mahomes is still young. Brady is the old man. Brady's the old man."
17:13;17:17;"So if this is like Mahomes talking to Brady. Yes. Old man."
17:17;17:20;"So Beck dropped it as a single and it came out of the promo."
17:20;17:27;"But as soon as it came out, Neil Young posted on Instagram a still from his music video,"
17:27;17:31;"This Note's For You, where he's holding up the beer bottles that's sponsored by no one."
17:31;17:35;"So he's throwing shade. Love it. Saying, you know, like middle finger,"
17:35;17:40;"you guys are using my song as promo. I don't approve."
17:40;17:47;"But back it up for a second. In 2021, he sold 50% of his catalog for $150 million."
17:47;17:51;"You pay the piper. Right. Yeah. So you already, you sold it off already."
17:51;17:54;"You have no say anymore over how this is used."
17:54;17:58;"I dig it. I like Neil going old school. He's a crotchety old dude."
17:58;18:05;"He's like, I'm a rock star. I don't chill for Coca-Cola and the NFL and Budweiser."
18:05;18:09;"I love that. And let's not forget that Neil's Canadian."
18:09;18:13;"He likes Canadian football. What's the Canadian Super Bowl called again?"
18:13;18:21;"The Grey Cup. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I still have a good memory of watching that with everybody on the,"
18:21;18:25;"I think we watched the 2019 Grey Cup on the bus. The whole band."
18:25;18:31;"I was like, whoa, alternate universe. Those CFL players, they have full-time jobs."
18:31;18:34;"They have other nine to fives. I love it. That's old school."
18:34;18:40;"I know Neil can get behind that. But yeah, I guess if you sell your catalog,"
18:40;18:43;"you kind of lose the right to complain. I don't know. I kind of like it."
18:43;18:52;"Look, I don't find it coherent, but I'm with you, Jake, in that I support Neil's right as a legend,"
18:52;18:58;"well put, as one of the goats to be a crotchety and coherent old hippie rocker."
18:58;19:02;"Just like with the Joe Rogan thing. I thought that was, did not totally make sense."
19:02;19:06;"But I do support his right to be slightly incoherent and angry."
19:06;19:15;"And you know, that's cool. You support his right to be old. I support his right to be an old man."
19:15;19:18;"Wow. This is also very, this is very Borghese and multi-layered too,"
19:18;19:25;"with the young quarterback and the old quarterback and the relatively much younger Beck"
19:25;19:28;"and the old Neil Young. Beck's got to make a music video."
19:28;19:35;"That's just him doing yet another cover of old man talking to Neil Young about how this made him feel."
19:35;19:39;"I felt bad for Beck in all this. Like Beck just did, you know, a straightforward cover,"
19:39;19:42;"drops his cover and he all of a sudden gets shaved to Neil Young."
19:42;19:46;"It's like Beck caught a stray in all this. What was his angle though?"
19:46;19:52;"I think a check. Yeah. Beck got a check and I don't know, maybe he's a passionate football fan."
19:52;19:59;"The Beck part was like the weirdest part of it for me. Like back in the NFL,"
19:59;20:03;"those are two American icons that do not blend."
20:03;20:08;"They really should have gotten Greta Van Fleet. Yeah, that would have ruled."
20:08;20:12;"It's like the young Bucks keeping the flame of rock alive."
20:12;20:16;"I know you just would have killed it. Oh man, look at your life."
20:16;20:20;"Just like a heavy Led Zeppelin revival version."
20:20;20:26;"I think this just smacks of like there's some Gen X,"
20:26;20:34;"Wyden, you know, Wyden Kennedy who just, you know, exact who loves Beck and he's just Beck's like, okay,"
20:34;20:36;"they're just like, you know what we could do for the football?"
20:36;20:39;"We could, you know, let's get back to do that. I mean, there's just no."
20:39;20:44;"I don't like the sincere singer songwriter mode of Beck at all."
20:44;20:48;"I don't like it in the context of shilling for the NFL."
20:48;20:52;"But he didn't write the song. You prefer Beck's more fun, ironic."
20:52;20:56;"But I can also see, let's say you're Beck and as a professional musician,"
20:56;21:02;"I can say sometimes you get all sorts of offers. Use your song this way, that way. At a certain point,"
21:02;21:07;"it's like, you know, you got to make some money. You say no to the things that are egregious."
21:07;21:10;"The rest of it, you know, is just showbiz."
21:10;21:14;"So I picture your Beck every once in a while. Somebody's like, hey Beck,"
21:14;21:21;"you won. Somebody wants to use loser in this kind of derogatory way to like in a commercial to make fun of another brand."
21:21;21:24;"And Beck's like, no way, man. That's not what loser is all about."
21:24;21:27;"And they're, you know, you probably get some 100 grand, you know,"
21:27;21:32;"you play at a Jared Kushner's birthday party and Beck's like, no, man, I'm not about that."
21:32;21:35;"No, I don't care how good the money is. All right."
21:35;21:38;"And then they're like, all right, Beck, we got one. This one,"
21:38;21:43;"you're going to cover a very tasteful song by beloved singer songwriter Neil Young."
21:43;21:46;"So when Beck said first, he's thinking, well, I guess Neil signed off on it,"
21:46;21:50;"which in a way he did by taking that big fat check."
21:50;21:52;"So Beck's thinking, all right, Neil signed off on it."
21:52;21:58;"He technically and what's this all about? He's like, well, actually it's for the NFL."
21:58;22:01;"Beck's like, I got no real problem with football."
22:01;22:03;"And then they say and actually the reason they chose this song is"
22:03;22:07;"because it makes so much sense because it's the young quarterback 24 years old,"
22:07;22:11;"the old one Tom Brady and Beck's like, oh, this is this is God's plan."
22:11;22:15;"This makes so much sense. This is not some weird stretch."
22:15;22:18;"This is not some misuse of one of my songs."
22:18;22:20;"Everything's lining up and they say, you know what?"
22:20;22:23;"And you know what else Beck? The money's not bad."
22:23;22:26;"All right. I love that song. All I got to do is record a cover."
22:26;22:29;"That's not bad. It's not great, but it's not bad."
22:29;22:37;"I like this idea that Jared Kushner wants Beck to play loser at a birthday party."
22:37;22:39;"I won't do it. So I just yeah,"
22:39;22:43;"I really feel for Beck in the sense that he probably does ask all these questions"
22:43;22:48;"and it probably did seem like it all lined up where Beck's like football American is apple pie."
22:48;22:51;"Neil signed off on it. It actually makes sense for once,"
22:51;22:55;"you know, you think Neil can name one Beck song?"
22:55;22:58;"Oh, yeah. I've actually seen Neil and Beck play together."
22:58;23:02;"Oh, wow. Oh another ring where I grew up in the Bay Area"
23:02;23:05;"and every October I would go to the Bridge School benefit."
23:05;23:08;"And oh, yeah, the famous bridge played it a couple times."
23:08;23:13;"And yeah, Neil would come out and play a song with Beck. A Beck song?"
23:13;23:20;"Usually a Neil song I think. Okay. My question today is, can Neil name one Beck song?"
23:20;23:23;"I'm going to guess no. One time at the Bridge School benefit,"
23:23;23:25;"they had some banter and Beck said,"
23:25;23:29;"Neil, not to put you on the spot, but could you name any of my songs?"
23:29;23:34;"It was a painful 10 minutes, but Neil got three."
23:34;23:44;"Guys, I'm on the official NFL eShop where they sell a Ed Sheeran starter jacket,"
23:44;23:49;"NFL starter jacket. So it is pretty sick."
23:49;23:52;"It's the it's the it looks like it's the Cowboys colors"
23:52;23:57;"and it just says Sheeran 2021 NFL kickoff."
23:57;24:00;"So they could have gone to that strikes me."
24:00;24:04;"He strikes me as a fan of football. They're casting a wide net there."
24:04;24:06;"They needed an American to sing it."
24:06;24:10;"I think they should have gone with Greta Van Fleet because if Neil Young hated on Greta Van Fleet,"
24:10;24:14;"they would just be like with all due respect, sir, your time has passed."
24:14;24:19;"You've inspired us, but we are the new generation of rock and roll."
24:19;24:22;"All right, Alex. We got to let you go, dude. Yeah, I got a bail."
24:22;24:24;"Thanks. All right. Thanks for explaining that to us, Alex."
24:24;24:28;"Of course. Good talking to you guys. Talk soon. Great reporting."
24:28;24:30;"Great reporting. Peace."
24:30;24:38;"Oh, man. Look at my life. I'm a lot like you."
24:38;24:56;"Oh, man. Look at my life. I'm a lot like you."
24:56;25:02;"Oh, man. Look at my life. Twenty four and so much."
25:02;25:09;"Live alone in a paradise. Makes me think of you."
25:09;25:15;"Love is such a cost. Give me things that won't get lost."
25:15;25:29;"Like a coin that won't get tossed. Rolling home to you."
25:29;25:35;"Oh, man. Take a look at my life. I'm a lot like you."
25:35;25:42;"I need someone to love me the whole day through."
25:42;25:48;"Oh, man. Look at my eyes and you tell it's true."
25:48;25:50;"You know, there's another bit of sports news. I don't want to go too deep into it"
25:50;25:54;"because actually I had a thought saying it on air just so you remember."
25:54;25:56;"We haven't had Bayo on the show in a while"
25:56;26:00;"and I'd love for him to come on the show soon"
26:00;26:05;"and talk about his cousin Harrison Bader plays for the Yankees now."
26:05;26:09;"Oh, wow. He got traded? Yeah. I can't remember if we ever talked about this,"
26:09;26:13;"but we'll go into detail hopefully with Chris."
26:13;26:15;"So Bayo has a little cousin named Harrison Bader."
26:15;26:19;"He grew up in the same town as Bayo in Westchester County."
26:19;26:23;"I must have met him very briefly when he was like 13 or 14 years old"
26:23;26:28;"because he came and was in the Oxford comma video."
26:28;26:32;"We had like a lot of our friends in it. It's a single shot video directed by Richard Ayoade"
26:32;26:36;"and there's a lot of you know, people jumping out and random people"
26:36;26:40;"and like my sister's friend from college who went on to be on that show Pen15 is in it"
26:40;26:45;"and that guy Hamilton Morris who has that show about drugs."
26:45;26:48;"All these people just popping up. A lot of heavyweights."
26:48;26:50;"Yeah, people pop. I didn't really know these people,"
26:50;26:52;"but you know just like we asked friends and family."
26:52;26:54;"You got some friends. Everybody come through and dressed up."
26:54;27:00;"It's a fun video and at the end there's like a bunch of kids running, little kids, some older kids."
27:00;27:02;"And so, you know, we're in upstate New York."
27:02;27:05;"So of course Bayo said, oh, maybe like some of my little cousins can come."
27:05;27:08;"So Harrison is in that video somewhere."
27:08;27:12;"And then a few years ago Bayo was saying that his cousin is playing for the St."
27:12;27:16;"Louis Cardinals. I remember that. You know, we were on tour during the season."
27:16;27:20;"So there's a lot of like he's watching the games and keeping us in the loop about it."
27:20;27:22;"And we've even happened to play in St."
27:22;27:26;"Louis on that tour and Bayo wore a Bader St."
27:26;27:31;"Louis Cards jersey on stage. So, you know, I've been like pretty aware of it."
27:31;27:34;"So I was already like, oh, that's awesome. Always kind of curious,"
27:34;27:37;"even though I don't particularly follow baseball. Curious to hear from Chris."
27:37;27:39;"Oh, how's your cousin doing all that stuff?"
27:39;27:45;"And then anyway, he got traded to the Yankees a couple months ago and Bayo will loop us in more."
27:45;27:48;"But I know his first game was a week or two ago."
27:48;27:55;"We were texting about it and you know, you can imagine that for a guy grew up Westchester County,"
27:55;28:00;"Stone's Throat from the Bronx, real kind of like New York kid,"
28:00;28:04;"like his mom is Bayo's aunt, grew up in Brooklyn."
28:04;28:09;"I assume his dad's a New Yorker guy. He's like part Jewish,"
28:09;28:12;"part Italian, real East Coast type dude."
28:12;28:17;"And then you end up on the Yankees, the magnitude of that. And the Yankees are good this year."
28:17;28:23;"Yeah, I've been hearing that. And they have this guy, who's the guy breaking the home run record? Aaron Judge."
28:23;28:26;"It's major. Anyway, we should have Bayo on to tell us more about it,"
28:26;28:31;"but I just wanted to end our sports roundup with a little bit of that."
28:31;28:35;"I might have to follow, really start following the Yankees because,"
28:35;28:37;"you know, I feel like with a lot of sports, I don't truly follow it,"
28:37;28:41;"but I do have these teams. It's like if I'm going to have a donut,"
28:41;28:45;"I'm going to go to Dunkin Donuts. If I'm going to follow baseball,"
28:45;28:47;"I'm going to support the Yankees. Let's get in man."
28:47;28:51;"It's the very end of the season. There's like a week left of the regular season and then the playoffs start."
28:51;28:55;"Wait, but Jake, I always forget. Were you a Yankees fan or a Mets fan?"
28:55;28:58;"You're a Yankees fan. Diehard Yankees when they were terrible."
28:58;29:04;"All right. Late 80s, early 90s. They lost over a hundred games in 1990."
29:04;29:07;"Mattingly had a back injury. He was out for most of the year. It was heartbreaking."
29:07;29:09;"All right, let's get in. I'd love to talk about that,"
29:09;29:15;"but let's get into some Alice in Chains talk. All right. Shifting gears. Shifting gears."
29:15;29:19;"Well, I know we're on a tight schedule tonight. We're trying to get in and out."
29:19;29:23;"I overbooked the show. My apologies. Jake did a great job booking the show."
29:23;29:28;"We got a hard out for you and we got three different calls to do."
29:28;29:31;"That's right. I'm on vacation in the Japanese countryside."
29:31;29:38;"Oh, but real quick before Alice in Chains, I just have to say I ate horse yesterday."
29:38;29:40;"I ate horse sashimi yesterday."
29:40;29:45;"We went to a restaurant that has like some type of kind of regional big udon noodles"
29:45;29:49;"and get a big bowl of that and they had horse sashimi on the menu."
29:49;29:53;"I thought, all right, got to try it. It came out very cold."
29:53;29:56;"I talked to a person I was with who actually lives in Japan"
29:56;29:59;"and I was like supposed to be this cold and they were kind of like,"
29:59;30:04;"I don't know. Have you let it chill out? It felt like almost like fresh out of the freezer."
30:04;30:08;"With the soy sauce and they had like some kind of spicy things to mix it with."
30:08;30:13;"The sauce was excellent. Once it kind of got a little less cold,"
30:13;30:19;"it tasted very close to like a really dark rich tuna sashimi."
30:19;30:23;"It tasted good. Nobody else at the table wanted to partake,"
30:23;30:28;"but I did feel I weirdly felt like I needed it."
30:28;30:30;"When nobody wanted to partake where they grossed out."
30:30;30:36;"Did you feel shunned or was it just sort of a neutral none for me?"
30:36;30:39;"Thank you. It was more like a none for me."
30:39;30:42;"Also, I'd ridden a horse earlier in the day."
30:42;30:45;"So there's a bit of like conversation about that full circle."
30:45;30:49;"And I said, yes, and circle life is what it is. People weren't grossed out"
30:49;30:52;"because when I sent you guys a picture when you looked at it truly,"
30:52;30:54;"if I told you that was salmon sashimi,"
30:54;30:59;"it's that same rich kind of dark purplish red color. Yeah, tuna."
30:59;31:02;"Yeah, it doesn't look there's nothing about it look gross"
31:02;31:03;"and I would say nothing about it tasted gross,"
31:03;31:09;"but I think people just felt a little bit like they made it this far without eating horse."
31:09;31:12;"Why start now? I would think the opposite."
31:12;31:14;"Yeah, that's true. This is a coincidence."
31:14;31:18;"You didn't seek out this restaurant because no, that was the thing."
31:18;31:24;"It was just suddenly saw it on the menu and felt like now's the time."
31:24;31:42;"And I'm gonna let it do all the talking."
31:42;31:45;"I fell in fear upon my back. I said, don't look back."
31:45;31:59;"Just keep on walking. The big black car said look this way. You said hey, will you marry me?"
31:59;32:18;"But I said no, no, no, no, no, no. I said no, no, you're not the one for me."
32:18;32:20;"So anyway, let's get back to Alice in Chains,"
32:20;32:23;"but I did feel like I just needed to know that's huge."
32:23;32:26;"That's a huge there's a lot of it's almost like a drop."
32:26;32:29;"There's a lot of grade-A reporting happening today on the show."
32:29;32:33;"So we got a Tom Chris has a lot of people in the field."
32:33;32:37;"We got our hands deep into the sports world deep into the horse world"
32:37;32:40;"and now deep into the Alice in Chains world."
32:40;32:44;"So so Jake it's the 30th anniversary of dirt."
32:44;32:49;"Yes, it's the 30th anniversary of dirt tomorrow because we're taping this on the 28th."
32:49;32:53;"It came out on September 29th 1992"
32:53;33:00;"and dirt and Soundgardens Bad Motor Finger are my favorite grunge albums."
33:00;33:03;"Well more than any Nirvana albums somehow."
33:03;33:05;"I don't really think of never mind is a grunge album."
33:05;33:08;"Maybe that's ridiculous. But yeah, I list their albums."
33:08;33:12;"I spend more time with them than never mind for sure."
33:12;33:17;"I return to dirt and Bad Motor Finger more than the never mind interesting."
33:17;33:22;"I love never mind. I just feel like the weight of history when I listen to never mind."
33:22;33:28;"It's listening. It's kind of like listening to like Sergeant Peppers or something right for the on the white album."
33:28;33:34;"Exactly. But yeah dirt came out in 92 incredible record"
33:34;33:39;"and I wanted to have well, I've been on a text thread for the last like six months with Aaron Olsen"
33:39;33:43;"and Ryan at last who are from Richard pictures"
33:43;33:50;"and Mountain Bruce and my brother Dave. We have a four-person text about Alice in Chains."
33:50;33:57;"Because several years ago Aaron had a one-off Alice in Chains cover band called five-lane blacktop"
33:57;34:01;"where there were five different people who sang lead"
34:01;34:07;"and so and we were there was discussion of maybe resurrecting that band for this Halloween."
34:07;34:11;"Although I would I said that I would just serve in a management role that I don't actually don't have"
34:11;34:18;"any musical chops to participate in a revival of five-lane blacktop was Dave in five-lane."
34:18;34:21;"No Dave was not in the original five-lane blacktop,"
34:21;34:25;"but we did a hangout for my birthday earlier this year"
34:25;34:32;"and there was kind of like an impromptu jam session in my living room with a bunch of detuned acoustic guitars."
34:32;34:39;"Take that down to drop D with Aaron and Ryan and then Dave doing Dave knows dirt incredibly well"
34:39;34:42;"and he was going to call in today, but he got tied up. He can't he can't call in today."
34:42;34:47;"Dave knows every little vocal nuance that Lane Staley performed on that record."
34:47;34:50;"Major influence on dirty projectors."
34:50;34:55;"I mean in a way in a roundabout way not not not not not exactly."
34:55;34:57;"But anyway, we were texting today and I was just like wow,"
34:57;35:01;"let's talk let's just like have the guys call in and talk about dirt a little bit."
35:01;35:06;"Absolutely as are you a fan of dirt, you know, I don't know is the truth like"
35:06;35:11;"when I think about Alice in Chains, they always seemed a little random to me,"
35:11;35:23;"but I always did kind of you know, I liked man in the box rooster or any of these songs on dirt roosters on dirt man in the box is on their first record facelift,"
35:23;35:27;"you know, I don't know them well enough, but I always thought Alice in Chains was interesting."
35:27;35:32;"I'm looking at the Japanese listing. It might be the same as as in the US,"
35:32;35:38;"but the description is for dirt is Alice in Chains were initially tagged with the grunge moniker when in fact,"
35:38;35:46;"their haunting ponderous sound was far closer to the progressive rock of Queensryche their haunting ponderous sound."
35:46;35:48;"I don't know if anybody wants their music to be described as ponderous,"
35:48;35:52;"but I like that and I like their general vibe."
35:52;35:59;"Now, let's go to the time crisis hotline."
35:59;36:03;"Hey, what's up? Welcome to TC."
36:03;36:10;"Welcome back. Thank you. Happy 30th anniversary. Thank you."
36:10;36:17;"Finally, my first question for you and Jake is did you guys buy dirt on release day?"
36:17;36:22;"So is this actually your 30th anniversary with this album?"
36:22;36:26;"I'll go first. I guess I was seven when it came out."
36:26;36:34;"I don't think I bought it the day it came out, but I think I bought it within the year or two that it came out probably."
36:34;36:37;"On cassette? It was an early CD for me."
36:37;36:46;"I was really anti CD for a long time as like a little kid because I thought it was like lame to be able to skip songs."
36:46;36:51;"That tracks for you. Yeah. As a seven-year-old?"
36:51;36:56;"Yeah, as a seven-year-old. I remember like friends were like getting CDs and I was like,"
36:56;37:04;"that's lame. But yeah, I probably picked it up in '93."
37:04;37:08;"At age eight. At the tender age of eight."
37:08;37:11;"Yes. Hold on, Mac. Let's just put on our calendar."
37:11;37:18;"We got to have Aaron back next year for his 30th anniversary of owning the CD of Dirt."
37:18;37:24;"Ryan, how about you? I got Dirt for Christmas in 1993 from my grandmother."
37:24;37:30;"So the album had been out. Wow. Cool grandma."
37:30;37:34;"Well, it's one of those things where my mom would ask like, Ryan, your grandma needs to get you a Christmas gift."
37:34;37:39;"What do you want? And I said, I want Blood Sugar Sex Magic and I want Alice in Chains Dirt."
37:39;37:42;"And then my grandma had to like give those to me."
37:42;37:46;"But you know, what is Alice in Chains Dirt? I had to try to explain it. She didn't care."
37:46;37:52;"Thanks, grandma. Yeah, exactly. I love you, grandma."
37:52;37:57;"I had a cassette tape of it, which I probably got in '93."
37:57;38:03;"Because it came out in the fall of '92. I bet the singles, you know, I wasn't up on AIC before Dirt."
38:03;38:09;"And the singles started rolling out. And yeah, at some point I purchased the cassette at the at the Wall,"
38:09;38:16;"which is the local kind of New England record store chain that was in the shopping center near my house."
38:16;38:19;"All right. So you were a bit older, Jake. You were like, you were 14."
38:19;38:23;"Well, Ryan and I are 10 days apart. We're both February of '77."
38:23;38:27;"So we were the right age. Yeah, wheelhouse."
38:27;38:33;"What did you guys think of that haunting ponderous sound? I loved it."
38:33;38:38;"But Aaron, you as a small child. Yeah. You were ready for the haunting ponderous sound of..."
38:38;38:44;"Yeah, I was so, so down. I have an older brother, three years older."
38:44;38:49;"So he was, you know, I was getting stuff funneling from him."
38:49;38:57;"So he was 11. Yeah, I mean, we were and still are like really into music, I guess."
38:57;39:04;"Like, yeah, my mom always had music on. There's just that's like all I knew."
39:04;39:10;"But an 11 year old saying to an eight year old, like, dude, check out this song, Junkhead."
39:10;39:16;"Well, OK, so that's the thing is my brother did like Alice in Chains, but you know when you're maybe again,"
39:16;39:21;"maybe this is me and my weird, like, fanaticism as a kid or whatever."
39:21;39:26;"But Alice in Chains was like my band away from my brother."
39:26;39:32;"Like, I think he kind of liked it. And then I like latched on and I was like, I'm the Alice in Chains guy."
39:32;39:36;"And like, you know, you really ride hard for specific things when you're a little kid."
39:36;39:44;"I find or I found in my life and especially in that era would be such a big deal to like invest in a T-shirt or a poster,"
39:44;39:47;"which I had two of. Even the CDs were expensive."
39:47;39:52;"So it's like if you're going to start buying someone's discography, you kind of got to be all in."
39:52;39:59;"Yeah. And yeah, I had two Alice in Chains posters next to each other on my wall in my bedroom when I was a kid."
39:59;40:05;"See, this is fascinating to me because I don't know if I could even cobble together a text thread of other people."
40:05;40:12;"I know in my life who are passionate about Alice in Chains or even know the album Dirt particularly well."
40:12;40:15;"So I always thought Alice in Chains seemed like pretty cool."
40:15;40:21;"Explain to me a little bit in the early 90s rock universe."
40:21;40:25;"So maybe on one side of the spectrum, you know, you had Metallica,"
40:25;40:31;"like just like a straight up metal band full of darkness. Black album came out '91."
40:31;40:34;"That still was looming large around this time. So you have that side."
40:34;40:36;"And then, of course, you have Pantera and just like heavy, heavy music."
40:36;40:40;"And then in the middle, you have grunge, you have Nirvana and Pearl Jam,"
40:40;40:45;"who maybe come across a bit punkier than the Alice in Chains and the Soundguards."
40:45;40:50;"And then you have like maybe the Chili Peppers or something, a bit more of a sense of humor, fun."
40:50;40:56;"What was Alice in Chains lane in that landscape?"
40:56;40:59;"Staley. I love the way you phrased that question."
40:59;41:02;"Yes, I really teed that one up."
41:02;41:06;"So they had their lane was Lane Staley, their singer."
41:06;41:10;"For me, it was like they had a very, very distinct,"
41:10;41:16;"perfect ratio between like metal, which I'm not a fan of, hard rock,"
41:16;41:20;"which I'm also not a fan of. And then I don't want to say pop,"
41:20;41:28;"because that's not the right word, but some sort of like major key, melodic, sugary rock."
41:28;41:32;"And like there was like such a perfect mix with that where there'd be like this,"
41:32;41:37;"this kind of sugar rush release on some of their great songs and the choruses,"
41:37;41:42;"but they really worked for it. So it didn't come off as like kind of too sweet, too saccharine."
41:42;41:47;"I think it's the harmonies. Yeah, I think the harmonies really is the gateway."
41:47;41:51;"If you're not a hard rock person, the harmonies are so sweet and clear and smooth"
41:51;41:56;"and they don't feel like metal. They feel more like, I don't know, a Crosby, Stills and Nash."
41:56;42:00;"And like, why? Because they have multi-part harmonies sometimes?"
42:00;42:03;"Did any of their, like how often was that happening? It was pretty distinct, I think."
42:03;42:09;"Oh, yeah, it was very, it was like their signature and I'd extend that to the guitars too."
42:09;42:12;"They had some guitar harmonies stuff happening, which wasn't as unique,"
42:12;42:16;"but it really mimics the guitar, the vocal harmonies, I thought."
42:16;42:22;"And like, I don't know, it was very harmonically rich music, I would say in general."
42:22;42:27;"Interesting. What do you guys think are Alice in Chains influences or origins?"
42:27;42:31;"Am I right to say that they seem like guys who maybe didn't give a s*** about punk rock?"
42:31;42:35;"That's interesting. I don't, I wouldn't think that."
42:35;42:37;"We've talked about this on the show before, when everybody would talk about,"
42:37;42:41;"we're the same age, Aaron, just like, you know, maybe you could see it, step in my shoes."
42:41;42:43;"Growing up in the 90s, I wasn't that passionate about grunge,"
42:43;42:47;"but then I got really into punk, including like the whole history of punk."
42:47;42:50;"And then people are like, well, you know, grunge is kind of like, you know,"
42:50;42:53;"'91 is the year punk broke and I would like listen to the grunge bands."
42:53;42:58;"I'd be like, what? I couldn't see the, because I was like so interested in the Clash and the Ramones"
42:58;43:03;"and even like Operation Ivy and like local pop punk and I couldn't see the connection."
43:03;43:08;"But then I was like, okay, I can see Kurt Cobain kind of being like a dude with a punk rock spirit"
43:08;43:12;"that he's bringing into his music. And then when I kind of found out, okay,"
43:12;43:15;"Eddie Vedder grew up loving punk rock, I can kind of see it."
43:15;43:18;"By the time I got to Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, I was like,"
43:18;43:22;"punk could not have happened and this still music would still be a,"
43:22;43:25;"makes sense coming out of the history of rock and roll."
43:25;43:28;"That's interesting. I mean, I think it's there in sort of a backdoor way,"
43:28;43:35;"but yeah, I see what you're saying. I mean, to me, there is like a direct lineage from like Sabbath"
43:35;43:38;"and Zeppelin with those harmonies, which those bands just have."
43:38;43:41;"Eagles are in there too, man."
43:41;43:42;"Eagles, CSNY? Yeah."
43:42;43:44;"Well, yeah. Totally."
43:44;43:49;"I think that Alice in Chains getting lumped in as grunge is,"
43:49;43:53;"I mean, did them a lot of favors. It put them across my seven-year-old desk,"
43:53;43:58;"but I don't think they're a grunge band. I think if you listen to Dirt next to the Black album,"
43:58;44:02;"it's just as metal as the Black album is."
44:02;44:09;"And it's so just dour and bleak, lyrically, that it's its own thing."
44:09;44:11;"The lyrics go so much harder than Metallica."
44:11;44:18;"I mean, I like Metallica, but like the lyrics in Metallica are generally pretty terrible."
44:18;44:23;"They write songs about werewolves. Alice in Chains writes songs about real problems."
44:23;44:25;"Wait, hold on a second. I don't really know what I'm talking about,"
44:25;44:29;"but like I know Alice in Chains, Rooster's about Vietnam."
44:29;44:33;"Couldn't you put that next to like one song about the horrors of war?"
44:33;44:38;"Rooster's about Jerry Cantrell's dad, whose nickname was the Rooster,"
44:38;44:43;"and who he was estranged from. And then like half the album is about like,"
44:43;44:47;"half the album is basically about heroin, like doing heroin."
44:47;44:51;"And like being tor- not in like, and I was reading some stuff today about it,"
44:51;44:54;"how like Layne Staley was saying how like fans would come up to him and be like,"
44:54;44:58;"""Yo, dude, I'm like messed up right now."" And Layne was like, ""I'm sorry."""
44:58;45:01;"Like that's not, this is not meant to celebrate doing heroin."
45:01;45:06;"This is, these songs are about like the torment I feel that I'm an addict."
45:06;45:10;"But like, like anything where like an artist takes troubling subject matter"
45:10;45:15;"and makes it aesthetic and makes it like exciting, people kind of misinterpret."
45:15;45:18;"Like people would think Tony Soprano's a cool guy."
45:18;45:22;"It's a little bit like people, I think a lot of, or at least according to Layne Staley,"
45:22;45:26;"people seem to like think that Dirt was a glorification of like shooting heroin."
45:26;45:32;"Well, it's like they say you can't make an anti-war war movie, right?"
45:32;45:35;"Because it's, it instantly is like glorifying it or whatever."
45:35;45:37;"And it's kind of, I think it's kind of the same with drug songs."
45:37;45:40;"And this, these songs go hard."
45:40;45:43;"They are dark. They're really dark. Like they're, they don't,"
45:43;45:47;"if you listen to the lyrics, it doesn't sound fun to do heroin."
45:48;45:53;"They found a way to kill me yet"
45:53;46:00;"I've burned with sting and sweat"
46:00;46:10;"Seems every path leads me to nowhere"
46:15;46:20;"Wife and kids, household pet"
46:20;46:27;"Mom ain't green when she knows they fed"
46:27;46:36;"A bullet screams at me from somewhere"
46:41;46:48;"Yeah, they come to snuff the rooster"
46:48;47:01;"Yeah, here come the rooster"
47:01;47:10;"You know we ain't gonna die"
47:10;47:15;"No, no, no, no, no"
47:15;47:22;"You know we ain't gonna die"
47:22;47:28;"So this album came out in '92."
47:28;47:33;"His addiction and his problems made it so he couldn't be in the band relatively soon after this."
47:33;47:35;"And then obviously he died."
47:35;47:40;"When was the original first classic Alice in Chains era over by?"
47:40;47:42;"Like Dirt basically."
47:42;47:46;"There was one more studio record, the self-titled from like '94, '95."
47:46;47:50;"I know, but it was, so by '96 he was having so many problems he couldn't."
47:50;47:52;"That's when they did Unplugged."
47:52;47:56;"And he's like half asleep the whole time, probably nodding off."
47:56;47:57;"I mean, yeah."
47:57;48:00;"So he was in bad shape by '96. And when did he die?"
48:00;48:02;"2002 or so."
48:02;48:03;"Yeah, '02."
48:03;48:08;"Right, so between '96 and '02 he was estranged from the band"
48:08;48:12;"and probably living a difficult life, struggling with addiction."
48:12;48:16;"So when you think about it, he was having big problems even as this album was made"
48:16;48:19;"and the life of the band did not extend too much past this."
48:19;48:21;"No, this was undoubtedly the peak."
48:21;48:23;"Right, heavy."
48:23;48:25;"A short trajectory for the band."
48:25;48:28;"What are the best songs on Dirt?"
48:28;48:31;"Everybody's got to pick one favorite. How about that?"
48:31;48:35;"Everybody on the AIC text group chat."
48:35;48:37;"Okay, Aaron, what are your three?"
48:37;48:41;"I can get it down to three. Rain When I Die, which my wife, we were just listening to it,"
48:41;48:45;"was like, I think I actually like this song. And I was like, yeah."
48:45;48:46;"That's incredible."
48:46;48:48;"And Junkhead."
48:48;48:53;"And I'll just leave it at those two, actually. Keep it with two."
48:53;48:54;"Ryan?"
48:54;48:57;"Oh, wait, actually, Damn That River, sorry."
48:57;48:59;"Damn That River goes hard."
48:59;49:02;"I'm going to jump on Wood before anybody else takes it."
49:02;49:05;"The single soundtrack, that song was really, it really jumped out for me."
49:05;49:06;"Incredible."
49:06;49:08;"Jake?"
49:08;49:12;"I'm going to go album opener, Them Bones."
49:12;49:15;"Just like that opening with him going, ""Ahh!"""
49:15;49:18;"In that weird time signature."
49:18;49:21;"Because that's track one. Throw that on for a second."
49:21;49:22;"Throw on Wood."
49:22;49:24;"Can I wait before you start it?"
49:24;49:29;"I was just talking with our mutual friend, Nick Kurgovich, about Dirt."
49:29;49:32;"And he said when he bought this album, when it came out,"
49:32;49:36;"because he bought it because he had the single soundtrack, like Wood,"
49:36;49:39;"that he put this on and he actually had a jump scare."
49:39;49:43;"And he vividly remembers it. It frightened him."
49:43;49:48;"The beginning of this record is a perfect, it's the perfect start to this record."
49:48;49:51;"Everybody listening, it's 1992."
49:55;49:58;"Driving home from the CD store."
50:16;50:19;"Some say."
50:37;50:40;"Yeah, I see what you mean. It really is the harmonies."
50:40;50:44;"And I don't know, I'm ashamed to say I may have never even heard this song,"
50:44;50:49;"but having a vague, just like 90s kid familiarity with Alice in Chains,"
50:49;50:52;"I know these harmonies. I know this vibe so well."
50:52;50:57;"I feel like they use very distinct intervals. I don't know what they are."
50:57;51:00;"But they have a very distinct vocal."
51:00;51:03;"It's in weird medieval sh*t."
51:03;51:09;"They do a lot of harmonies that are kind of totally different melodic lines from each other."
51:09;51:11;"Like they're not always in..."
51:11;51:13;"Like counterpoint?"
51:13;51:16;"They're not crossing over. Yeah, it's counterpoint."
51:16;51:20;"They're not parallel or in similar motion always."
51:26;51:29;"I love this solo too, by the way."
51:29;51:32;"Yeah, but I feel like the verse is in a weird time signature,"
51:32;51:35;"and then the chorus they go into straight 4/4."
51:35;51:39;"And it's kind of what I'm talking about. That sugary kind of release."
51:39;51:41;"Yeah."
51:41;51:43;"The choruses in this band are so amazing."
51:43;51:48;"Like I said, I don't like metal really, and I'm not a huge fan of hard rock,"
51:48;51:51;"which is a broad genre, admittedly."
51:51;51:55;"But I love this band, and it's because of those choruses."
51:55;52:02;"One of the least accessible songs on the album has one of the poppiest choruses."
52:02;52:05;"It's basically a Weezer chorus or something."
52:05;52:07;"Oh, Angry Chair?"
52:07;52:10;"Yeah, it's Angry Chair. I don't mind that one."
52:10;52:13;"Throw in Down in a Hole."
52:13;52:15;"You can go out on Down in a Hole."
52:15;52:17;"This is the single, right? Down in a Hole?"
52:17;52:21;"Yeah, this is like a ballad, but this is my other favorite."
52:23;52:27;"I have nothing to confirm this, but I think that Jerry Cantrell"
52:27;52:30;"must have grown up listening to Boston."
52:30;52:31;"Yes."
52:31;52:36;"Because this, like the guitar, think of this song as a Boston song."
52:36;52:38;"Absolutely. Great call."
52:38;52:40;"Totally."
52:41;52:47;"This is funny too, because they famously say that Kurt was inspired by Boston"
52:47;52:50;"more than a feeling for Smells Like Teen Spirit."
52:50;52:51;"Funny."
52:51;52:52;"Godfather's a grunge."
52:52;52:54;"Yeah, man."
52:54;52:57;"How is Smells Like Teen Spirit related to--"
52:57;52:58;"Well, just like--"
52:58;53:00;"(singing)"
53:00;53:01;"The same kind of riff."
53:01;53:04;"Time for a critical reappraisal of Boston."
53:22;53:26;"That's another AIC move of harmonies in the verses,"
53:26;53:30;"and then the huge chorus. It's just lame."
53:30;53:31;"Very dynamic."
53:31;53:32;"Interesting."
53:32;53:35;"Incredible dynamics in this band."
53:52;53:56;"This is a real '90s episode, because our next guest is this guy Stephen Hyden,"
53:56;54:00;"who--oh, Ryan knows Stephen Hyden. We went to the Goose Show with him."
54:00;54:01;"Absolutely."
54:01;54:02;"Pre-pandemic."
54:02;54:05;"That's right. He's got a new book about Pearl Jam."
54:05;54:08;"He wrote a book on Pearl Jam that just came out this week."
54:08;54:11;"Actually, one thing I want to ask Stephen about is, in the Pearl Jam book,"
54:11;54:14;"he talks quite a bit about Stone Temple Pilots,"
54:14;54:17;"who he likes and has a lot of compassion for."
54:17;54:19;"And it's funny, listening to Alice in Chains,"
54:19;54:23;"because people always said Stone Temple Pilots were a Pearl Jam ripoff,"
54:23;54:26;"I weirdly hear more Alice in Chains."
54:26;54:28;"And of course they were doing their own thing."
54:28;54:31;"Wait, you mean you hear Pearl Jam in Alice in Chains,"
54:31;54:33;"or you hear Alice in Chains in Pearl Jam?"
54:33;54:36;"I hear more Alice in Chains in STP than I do Pearl Jam."
54:36;54:37;"Yes."
54:37;54:38;"Oh, interesting."
54:38;54:39;"Yes, absolutely."
54:39;54:42;"Especially when we were listening to Them Bones, I was like,"
54:42;54:45;"""Okay, I could see Stone Temple Pilots take a lot of inspiration"
54:45;54:48;"from the dynamics and the chords of that song."""
54:48;54:52;"Think about this song and then Stone Temple Pilots' song ""Creep."""
54:52;54:53;"Yeah."
54:53;54:56;"Half the man I used to be."
54:56;54:58;"Oh, yeah, yeah, totally."
54:58;55:01;"Because even lyrically, the Scott Weiland archetype"
55:01;55:05;"is more similar to Layne Staley than it is to Eddie Vedder."
55:05;55:09;"And I feel like Cantrell and the DiLeo brothers"
55:09;55:13;"are more Zeppelin heads than Mike McReady."
55:13;55:16;"Mike McReady to me is like straight Lynyrd Skynyrd."
55:16;55:18;"He doesn't have the sophistication of Page."
55:18;55:19;"Jake has no respect for Mike."
55:19;55:20;"I hate McReady."
55:20;55:22;"I have zero patience for him."
55:22;55:25;"But he doesn't have the sophistication of Page."
55:25;55:28;"I feel like Cantrell and the DiLeo brothers,"
55:28;55:34;"they tap into that ""Houses of the Holy Era"" Zeppelin energy."
55:34;55:38;"But Pearl Jam never touched, to their detriment."
55:38;55:43;"Also, there's something else that STP and Chains have in common."
55:43;55:47;"And that's a minor thing, but there's this--"
55:47;55:49;"I don't even know what you'd call it."
55:49;55:53;"I guess like turns of phrase that are very working man things."
55:53;55:56;"There's an Allison Chain song where he says,"
55:56;56:00;"""Never wanted to end up like my old man,"" or something."
56:00;56:03;"It's very '70s, like, ""Oh, man, I'm working for county."
56:03;56:05;"Gonna end up like my old man."""
56:05;56:10;"And then STP is like, ""All's I got's is time."""
56:10;56:13;"I don't know. There's this weird--"
56:13;56:18;"I feel like it's something very '70s working class thing or something."
56:18;56:21;"I don't know where it's coming from or what it's doing."
56:21;56:24;"But I remember it distinctly as a kid"
56:24;56:27;"and thinking it was very cool to talk like that."
56:27;56:32;"Talk about my old man and, like, ""All's I got's is like five bucks, man."""
56:32;56:34;"Right. 37."
56:34;56:35;"Yeah, I don't know."
56:35;56:38;"Kurt would never. Eddie probably not."
56:49;56:53;"It's very interesting to think of them as being kind of like the '90s CSNY."
56:53;56:56;"Just to break it down, you guys have been talking about everybody in the band so far,"
56:56;56:59;"but just for me and the listeners,"
56:59;57:03;"so you had Layne Staley, the brilliant but doomed singer."
57:03;57:08;"Jerry Cantrell was the lead guitarist and kind of co-songwriter,"
57:08;57:10;"or what was Jerry Cantrell's deal?"
57:10;57:13;"I think he was the primary songwriter as far as I understand."
57:13;57:15;"He also sang quite a bit."
57:15;57:16;"He was the harmony."
57:16;57:18;"So he was singing a lot of those harmonies."
57:18;57:22;"And then you have bass and rhythm section was the DeLeo brothers?"
57:22;57:24;"[laughter]"
57:24;57:26;"That was STP, dude."
57:26;57:27;"Oh, okay."
57:27;57:30;"Dean and Robert DeLeo were the--"
57:30;57:32;"The bassist and guitarist."
57:32;57:34;"Wait, is it like Don DeLeo?"
57:34;57:35;"Yeah."
57:35;57:36;"Spelled differently."
57:36;57:38;"No, no, no. Spelled differently. It's D-E-L-E-O."
57:38;57:42;"Who are the two brothers on bass and drums in Alice in Chains?"
57:42;57:44;"Honestly, couldn't tell you."
57:44;57:46;"Mike Starr is the bass player."
57:46;57:48;"Ricky Starr, the Starr brothers."
57:48;57:50;"Mike and Spike Starr."
57:50;57:55;"And he left, I think, because he had a crippling heroin addiction."
57:55;57:58;"He was kicked out in early '93."
57:58;57:59;"Damn."
57:59;58:03;"And then the drummer is Mike--"
58:03;58:05;"I'm not wild about the drummer, I gotta say."
58:05;58:08;"I'm not wild about the bass playing and the drumming in this band."
58:08;58:11;"It's really about Lane and Jerry."
58:11;58:14;"I can't remember the drummer's name."
58:14;58:16;"Speaking of--"
58:16;58:20;"I've always said how there's something about all these early '90s guys,"
58:20;58:22;"their names just sounded grunge."
58:22;58:25;"They were names that you would not have seen in a different era of rock."
58:25;58:29;"Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic,"
58:29;58:31;"especially Nirvana, Dave Grohl."
58:31;58:35;"Those names, you would not have seen them pop up in the '60s or the '70s."
58:35;58:37;"But I can tell you, Jerry Cantrell,"
58:37;58:41;"that actually sounds like a dude playing guitar on a record from 1968."
58:41;58:42;"Oh, yeah."
58:42;58:44;"That's like an old-school name."
58:44;58:46;"Yeah, Jerry Cantrell played with Ellis Presley."
58:46;58:47;"Yeah."
58:47;58:48;"Yeah, exactly."
58:48;58:51;"[laughter]"
58:51;58:54;"He was in the Las Vegas Review Band."
58:54;58:57;"And on guitar, on guitar, got my main man."
58:57;58:59;"Put your hands together for Jerry Cantrell."
58:59;59:00;"Woo!"
59:00;59:03;"Jerry, his name's Jerry, for Christ's sake."
59:03;59:04;"It's soft."
59:04;59:07;"Yeah, the Jerry already, obviously, is like a classic rock name,"
59:07;59:09;"and then the Cantrell just takes it to the next level."
59:09;59:12;"What's Jerry Cantrell been doing since--"
59:12;59:14;"He's continuing Alice in Chains."
59:14;59:16;"Right, who sings in Alice in Chains now?"
59:16;59:18;"They have a guy that sounds exactly like Lane."
59:18;59:19;"Yep."
59:19;59:22;"Can I speak to how much you hate the drummer real quick, Jake?"
59:22;59:23;"Sure."
59:23;59:26;"Have you ever listened to Jar of Flies, the follow-up EP?"
59:26;59:28;"Yeah, I know those songs."
59:28;59:32;"Is it possible to throw on just the beginning of No Excuses?"
59:32;59:36;"'Cause I think that encapsulates why he is not to like."
59:36;59:39;"It's stiff, it's technical, and it's got a bad tone."
59:39;59:41;"It's got too many cymbals."
59:41;59:43;"And this says it all."
59:43;59:47;"Thank you, Aaron."
59:47;59:54;"I'm not mad at that."
59:54;59:55;"Wait, that's from 1993?"
59:55;59:57;"This sounds like Dave Matthews Band."
59:57;59:58;"It does?"
59:58;59:59;"Yeah."
59:59;01:00:01;"I enjoy the Dave Matthews Band element."
01:00:01;01:00:04;"Here we go, the verses on the harmony."
01:00:04;01:00:05;"[laughs]"
01:00:05;01:00:15;"They really have a signature harmony."
01:00:15;01:00:16;"They really do."
01:00:16;01:00:22;"That's great."
01:00:22;01:00:24;"I mean, it really is Dave Matthews Band."
01:00:24;01:00:26;"Yeah, this is totally damn big."
01:00:26;01:00:27;"[laughs]"
01:00:27;01:00:29;"It just needs a bit of a..."
01:00:29;01:00:33;"Wait, play that intro one more time, though."
01:00:33;01:00:34;"I want to hear that drum intro."
01:00:34;01:00:36;"It's like a chill drum line."
01:00:36;01:00:44;"It almost sounds like the beginning of a Peter Gabriel song from like So, too."
01:00:44;01:00:47;"It almost has like Tunnel of Love, Springsteen, almost like..."
01:00:47;01:00:49;"It sounds like '86, kind of."
01:00:49;01:00:50;"Yeah."
01:00:50;01:00:53;"If you had some slight sample, like an ork stab or something."
01:00:53;01:01:02;"I actually think that Mike Starr was fine on bass."
01:01:02;01:01:08;"And then when they got the other guy, like Mike Inez, he's all busy."
01:01:08;01:01:11;"He's like the equivalent of the drummer, but on bass."
01:01:11;01:01:12;"Right."
01:01:12;01:01:13;"Too technical."
01:01:13;01:01:14;"Yeah."
01:01:14;01:01:18;"There's something about those harmonies that also, when you hear like kind of haunting field"
01:01:18;01:01:24;"recordings of like regional folk music from like the '50s, like somebody goes to like"
01:01:24;01:01:29;"an Irish pub somewhere, and these people have like, they've just been like, they've never"
01:01:29;01:01:33;"recorded in their life, and they've just been like, there's like a darkness to it."
01:01:33;01:01:35;"Weird droney harmonies."
01:01:35;01:01:40;"As I went a-rambling one morning."
01:01:40;01:01:46;"I'd love to get a genealogy of Layne Staley and see if I can trace his heritage back to..."
01:01:46;01:01:48;"It's probably Irish back there."
01:01:48;01:01:50;"Yeah, it's probably Scott's Irish."
01:01:50;01:01:51;"Layne Staley."
01:01:51;01:01:53;"Oh, Layne Staley."
01:01:53;01:01:57;"It is also the 30th anniversary of Peter Gabriel's album, Us."
01:01:57;01:01:58;"Okay."
01:01:58;01:02:01;"Which has the song Digging in the Dirt."
01:02:01;01:02:03;"Oh, I've heard that song before."
01:02:03;01:02:07;"He was tearing it up on the modern rock charts right here."
01:02:07;01:02:15;"We've done a couple different 1992 top fives where singles from Peter Gabriel were in there."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"Steam."
01:02:16;01:02:18;"I'm digging in the dirt."
01:02:18;01:02:19;"Give me steam."
01:02:19;01:02:22;"Well, that's weird, Aaron, because you've also done a Peter Gabriel cover band."
01:02:22;01:02:23;"You've done..."
01:02:23;01:02:24;"This is true."
01:02:24;01:02:26;"You've done Five Lane Block Top."
01:02:26;01:02:28;"What was the name of the Peter Gabriel band?"
01:02:28;01:02:30;"It was just LA Takedown."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"Oh, no, it was Red Rain."
01:02:31;01:02:34;"Okay, Red Rain, and you've done Richard Pictures."
01:02:34;01:02:38;"But yeah, I feel like there's something cosmic happening there where, you know..."
01:02:38;01:02:39;"Wait, and The Doors."
01:02:39;01:02:41;"Well, yeah, we did The Doors, yeah."
01:02:41;01:02:42;"Of course."
01:02:42;01:02:44;"I'm also in a Bob Dylan cover band."
01:02:44;01:02:46;"I mean, it just keeps going and going."
01:02:46;01:02:50;"But yeah, the fact that Peter Gabriel released a song called Digging in the Dirt,"
01:02:50;01:02:53;"pretty much the day that Alice in Chains put out Dirt."
01:02:53;01:02:54;"I don't know."
01:02:54;01:02:55;"Zeitgeist."
01:02:55;01:02:56;"Yeah, Dirt."
01:02:56;01:02:57;"I mean, it totally makes..."
01:02:57;01:02:58;"Yeah, too."
01:02:58;01:03:04;"And also, if you had to pick a word to associate with a year like '92, Dirt."
01:03:04;01:03:05;"Makes sense."
01:03:05;01:03:11;"I wonder if them calling it Dirt was like a grab at being more grunge."
01:03:11;01:03:16;"Like Dirt, grunge, there's an association, I would say, just dirty, grungy."
01:03:16;01:03:18;"It's the perfect record album title for this."
01:03:18;01:03:23;"Maybe somewhere deep in their hearts, they wanted to call it Ascension of the Phoenix."
01:03:23;01:03:26;"And someone was like, ""No, dude."
01:03:26;01:03:28;"Guys, it's '92."
01:03:28;01:03:29;"It's just Dirt."""
01:03:29;01:03:37;"Actually, Ezra, to answer your earlier question, Dirt to me, that has some punk ethos to it."
01:03:37;01:03:38;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
01:03:38;01:03:43;"Instead of naming it like a typical dumb metal album name, like Ascension of the Phoenix."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"No, dude, it's Dirt."
01:03:44;01:03:45;"Dirt."
01:03:45;01:03:46;"Yeah."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"It's like, there's a band called Pavement."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"We're going to name our album Dirt."
01:03:50;01:03:51;"It's raw."
01:03:51;01:03:54;"The most punk thing on the album is the joke song."
01:03:54;01:03:57;"Do you know who the vocal is in the joke song?"
01:03:57;01:03:58;"I do."
01:03:58;01:04:00;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:00;01:04:03;"It's Tom Mariah from Slayer."
01:04:03;01:04:04;"Oh, OK."
01:04:04;01:04:05;"So they're friends with Slayer?"
01:04:05;01:04:06;"Yeah."
01:04:06;01:04:07;"All right, well, let's throw that on."
01:04:07;01:04:08;"The most metal thing about them."
01:04:08;01:04:10;"Oh, God, this is not the song to throw on."
01:04:10;01:04:11;"All right, we're going to throw on the--"
01:04:11;01:04:12;"That's a terrible song."
01:04:12;01:04:15;"--Alison Chaitin's joke song featuring Tom from Slayer."
01:04:15;01:04:16;"All right, thanks so much, guys."
01:04:16;01:04:18;"Great to have you on, as always."
01:04:18;01:04:22;"Everybody go throw on Dirt in honor of the 30th anniversary."
01:04:22;01:04:25;"[MUSIC - ALISON CHAITIN, ""DIRT""]"
01:04:26;01:04:29;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:29;01:04:32;"I am fire."
01:04:32;01:04:35;"[SCREAMING]"
01:04:35;01:04:43;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:43;01:04:46;"[MUSIC - ALISON CHAITIN, ""DIRT""]"
01:04:46;01:04:49;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:49;01:05:05;"All right, Jake, you did a great job booking this episode."
01:05:05;01:05:07;"Like you said, very '90s."
01:05:07;01:05:10;"Our next guest is Stephen Hyden, legendary rock journalist,"
01:05:10;01:05:12;"friend of the show."
01:05:12;01:05:14;"He's got a new book, which I was lucky enough"
01:05:14;01:05:15;"to read earlier this year."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"I know I talked about it on the show."
01:05:17;01:05:20;"It's called Long Road, Pearl Jam, and the Soundtrack of a Generation."
01:05:20;01:05:21;"It's out now."
01:05:21;01:05:22;"It's cool."
01:05:22;01:05:26;"It's like, you know, he's got his kind of idiosyncratic personal take"
01:05:26;01:05:27;"on Pearl Jam and their career."
01:05:27;01:05:30;"But it's also like very factual."
01:05:30;01:05:32;"He's always great at kind of contextualizing"
01:05:32;01:05:33;"when things are happening."
01:05:33;01:05:38;"I think it's a great book, especially for the kind of marginal Pearl Jam fan"
01:05:38;01:05:39;"like me."
01:05:39;01:05:40;"And me."
01:05:40;01:05:41;"Or Jake."
01:05:41;01:05:43;"People who are like, you know, like kind of in--"
01:05:43;01:05:44;"maybe just like curious."
01:05:44;01:05:46;"People are always like, yeah, I like Pearl Jam, OK."
01:05:46;01:05:47;"What's the deal with them?"
01:05:47;01:05:49;"Pearl Jam, curious."
01:05:49;01:05:52;"If you're PJ curious, it's a great book."
01:05:52;01:05:55;"Because you probably know many of the songs."
01:05:55;01:05:56;"And you've probably been like, wow, people are really"
01:05:56;01:05:57;"passionate about that band."
01:05:57;01:06:00;"People are out there like throwing on flannel shirts"
01:06:00;01:06:03;"and following them in a van like the Grateful Dead."
01:06:03;01:06:04;"What are they buying into?"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"And this book really explains it and gives you"
01:06:06;01:06:09;"a history of the band dynamics and all that stuff."
01:06:09;01:06:12;"Are they buying into those Mike McReady guitar solos?"
01:06:12;01:06:14;"I want to start with that."
01:06:14;01:06:16;"All right, so let's get Steven on the phone."
01:06:16;01:06:19;"Now, let's go to the Time Crisis Hotline."
01:06:19;01:06:23;"[PHONE RINGING]"
01:06:23;01:06:24;"Hey."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"Hey, Steven, what's up?"
01:06:25;01:06:27;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:06:27;01:06:29;"Oh my god, I'm thrilled."
01:06:29;01:06:31;"It's been way too long."
01:06:31;01:06:34;"I feel like it's been like a few years at this point."
01:06:34;01:06:35;"In the COVID era."
01:06:35;01:06:37;"But yeah, time flies."
01:06:37;01:06:39;"Time flies when you're having fun."
01:06:39;01:06:41;"We were just hyping up the book."
01:06:41;01:06:43;"I've actually been talking about this book since I read it,"
01:06:43;01:06:47;"which was, I don't know, seven months ago or something."
01:06:47;01:06:49;"You were one of the first people to read it."
01:06:49;01:06:50;"I'm so glad."
01:06:50;01:06:53;"I really appreciate you giving me the early copy"
01:06:53;01:06:58;"because I was able to read it before I saw my first Pearl Jam"
01:06:58;01:07:01;"show with Jake at the Forum."
01:07:01;01:07:04;"Yeah, and you did that episode about it."
01:07:04;01:07:07;"And you were with Adam from the War on Drugs."
01:07:07;01:07:09;"Oh yeah, Adam from the War on Drugs came to the show."
01:07:09;01:07:11;"Actually, that's another thing."
01:07:11;01:07:13;"It's not very popping, but after that show,"
01:07:13;01:07:16;"we did have a little bit of a Pearl Jam text thread."
01:07:16;01:07:17;"That's true."
01:07:17;01:07:19;"Because, Steven, before you came on,"
01:07:19;01:07:22;"I had some friends on discussing the 30th anniversary of"
01:07:22;01:07:24;"Alice in Chains' Dirt album."
01:07:24;01:07:25;"Oh."
01:07:25;01:07:28;"I have a discrete Alice in Chains text thread."
01:07:28;01:07:30;"And now Ezra brings this up."
01:07:30;01:07:31;"It's right."
01:07:31;01:07:35;"We have a very sporadically used Pearl Jam text thread."
01:07:35;01:07:40;"Me, Ezra, Adam from War on Drugs, and Ezra's tour manager, Brian."
01:07:40;01:07:42;"Is that Alice in Chains thread?"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"Is that really grim?"
01:07:44;01:07:46;"I just feel like if you're talking about Dirt,"
01:07:46;01:07:51;"it's a brilliant record, but it's one of the most depressing albums."
01:07:51;01:07:55;"It's mostly texts about when can we get together and drink"
01:07:55;01:07:56;"and listen to Dirt."
01:07:56;01:07:58;"[laughter]"
01:07:58;01:08:01;"And it's mostly like, ""I'm out of town, the 10th to the 18th."
01:08:01;01:08:02;"I can't make it then."""
01:08:02;01:08:05;"That's mostly what the text thread is."
01:08:05;01:08:08;"Although, today was very active because I was trying to wrangle up some guests"
01:08:08;01:08:11;"for the show, and my brother Dave was going to come on,"
01:08:11;01:08:14;"and then he had to bail last minute because he's a huge Dirt head."
01:08:14;01:08:15;"Anyway."
01:08:15;01:08:17;"What are you guys drinking on Dirt night?"
01:08:17;01:08:18;"Harge."
01:08:19;01:08:20;"Whiskey."
01:08:20;01:08:21;"Stop fervent."
01:08:21;01:08:22;"Whiskey, tequila, ever clear."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"[laughter]"
01:08:24;01:08:26;"As long as it's not heroin."
01:08:26;01:08:28;"As long as you're not shooting heroin together,"
01:08:28;01:08:32;"because I feel like that would be the ultimate Dirt night expression."
01:08:32;01:08:36;"I feel like if you're just drinking Miller High Life or something,"
01:08:36;01:08:39;"that's like the safe Dirt night."
01:08:39;01:08:40;"That's the dad's Dirt night."
01:08:40;01:08:41;"Yeah, exactly."
01:08:41;01:08:44;"That's like safe suburban dad's Dirt night."
01:08:44;01:08:47;"When you're hanging out on Dirt night, are you trying to discern,"
01:08:47;01:08:50;"like, is this Layne Staley singing?"
01:08:50;01:08:52;"Is this Jerry Cantrell singing?"
01:08:52;01:08:56;"Because I always feel like that is, if you're trying to dissect"
01:08:56;01:09:02;"Alice in Chains sonically, because there is this thing with Alice in Chains,"
01:09:02;01:09:06;"I feel like, where people feel like, well, maybe Jerry Cantrell is actually"
01:09:06;01:09:10;"the actual lead singer of that band because they're always singing together."
01:09:10;01:09:14;"Layne Staley gets so much credit as a great lead singer, and he is."
01:09:14;01:09:18;"But I feel like especially as he faltered, it was like Jerry Cantrell was almost"
01:09:18;01:09:21;"like the secret lead singer of that band."
01:09:21;01:09:25;"Well, okay, I don't know their career very much after Dirt."
01:09:25;01:09:28;"Like, Dirt is the height of that band."
01:09:28;01:09:29;"Jake's a Dirt guy."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"Yeah, I'm a Dirt guy, hey."
01:09:31;01:09:33;"[Laughter]"
01:09:33;01:09:37;"On the song ""Wood"" and on the song ""Down in a Hole,"""
01:09:37;01:09:40;"that's Cantrell on the verses."
01:09:40;01:09:41;"Right."
01:09:41;01:09:44;"Maybe Layne is in there a little bit on the harmonies with him,"
01:09:44;01:09:46;"and they're gentle, they're soft."
01:09:46;01:09:50;"And then when the choruses just go off, huge choruses,"
01:09:50;01:09:53;"Layne comes in, we were just talking about this,"
01:09:53;01:09:55;"Layne comes in with no harmonies."
01:09:55;01:09:56;"Right."
01:09:56;01:09:59;"Like on ""Them Bones,"" it's like weird harmonies,"
01:09:59;01:10:04;"which is a really cool reversal of the classic solo vocal verse,"
01:10:04;01:10:08;"and then someone comes in on the chorus just to beef it up a bit."
01:10:08;01:10:12;"Well, if I may make a recommendation for post-Dirt,"
01:10:12;01:10:19;"Allison Chains, the ""Jar of Flies"" EP is arguably as good as Dirt,"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"and it's a little more melodic, you know, because that's like--"
01:10:21;01:10:22;"I like the unplugged."
01:10:22;01:10:23;"I know those songs."
01:10:23;01:10:24;"Person of Allison Chains."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Yeah, we were just listening to that and making fun of the drum tone."
01:10:26;01:10:27;"Jake can't stand the drummer."
01:10:27;01:10:29;"I can't deal with--"
01:10:29;01:10:31;"Okay, here's the transition for you."
01:10:31;01:10:33;"I can't deal with the drummer of Allison Chains,"
01:10:33;01:10:36;"and I can't deal with the lead guitar player in Pearl Jam."
01:10:36;01:10:38;"Oh, what, McCready?"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"I can't deal."
01:10:39;01:10:40;"You're taking shots at McCready?"
01:10:40;01:10:41;"Jake has been hating on McCready."
01:10:41;01:10:42;"I can't deal with him."
01:10:42;01:10:43;"Oh, my God."
01:10:43;01:10:46;"He's the most hard rock cafe dude ever."
01:10:46;01:10:51;"He's the most awkward lead guitar player"
01:10:51;01:10:53;"of a major band I can think of."
01:10:53;01:10:54;"Oh, my God."
01:10:54;01:10:56;"There's 10,000 guys like him."
01:10:56;01:10:58;"I can't believe you're going that hard on him, Jake."
01:10:58;01:11:01;"Even at the show, Jake was just standing there just being like,"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"""Not feeling McCready."""
01:11:03;01:11:06;"I feel like this is like ""Saving Private Ryan,"""
01:11:06;01:11:07;"and like they're taking shots--"
01:11:07;01:11:11;"I'm taking bullets coming out on the beach immediately,"
01:11:11;01:11:14;"taking shots at McCready, because like--"
01:11:14;01:11:15;"I mean, I write about this in the book."
01:11:15;01:11:17;"He's my favorite member of the band."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Oh, wow."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"So now we're really throwing it down here."
01:11:20;01:11:21;"We're at loggerheads."
01:11:21;01:11:24;"I'll throw this out there just like as an alternative thing."
01:11:24;01:11:25;"Maybe this will change your mind."
01:11:25;01:11:31;"I think that if you look at Pearl Jam from a jam band perspective,"
01:11:31;01:11:34;"and if you're looking at the live recordings,"
01:11:34;01:11:36;"that McCready is the one who is bringing"
01:11:36;01:11:40;"the improvisational aspect to the live stuff."
01:11:40;01:11:44;"So if you're listening to ""Even Flow,"" for instance,"
01:11:44;01:11:47;"the 1,000th live version of that song,"
01:11:47;01:11:52;"the only reason why it's different is what McCready is bringing to the table,"
01:11:52;01:11:55;"because he is playing a different solo every single time."
01:11:55;01:11:59;"Like he's the one who--I think especially live--"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"I mean, it's funny that you say this,"
01:12:01;01:12:04;"because I went to go see Pearl Jam with my friend Rob,"
01:12:04;01:12:08;"who I did the ""36 from the Vault"" podcast with."
01:12:08;01:12:10;"And he was rolling his eyes at McCready a lot,"
01:12:10;01:12:12;"because he's very hammy live."
01:12:12;01:12:14;"He's like stalking around the stage."
01:12:14;01:12:18;"He's like doing a lot of the rock theatric type stuff."
01:12:18;01:12:23;"But I think musically, he's the one who's like bringing"
01:12:23;01:12:27;"different things to every live performance that they do."
01:12:27;01:12:31;"So that is part of what I really like about him."
01:12:31;01:12:35;"If you want to say there's a Jerry, you want to say Eddie is the Jerry."
01:12:35;01:12:40;"But in a way, musically speaking, McCready is the Jerry of Pearl Jam"
01:12:40;01:12:45;"in the sense of the guitar player changing up the live versions"
01:12:45;01:12:47;"every time they play live."
01:12:47;01:12:51;"How about this? There's no Jerry in Pearl Jam."
01:12:51;01:12:53;"Pearl Jam is Pearl Jam."
01:12:53;01:12:55;"The Grateful Dead are the Grateful Dead."
01:12:55;01:12:57;"There's not even a Jerry Cantrell."
01:12:57;01:12:59;"There's not even a Cantrell."
01:12:59;01:13:03;"He plays a different guitar solo every night, and they're all bad."
01:13:03;01:13:06;"I'm sorry. He can just be the lead guy."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"He can be like the SNL."
01:13:08;01:13:12;"I'm sorry. Just sub him in for the guy that played for the SNL band"
01:13:12;01:13:14;"for 10 years."
01:13:14;01:13:18;"Wait, wait, wait. You're taking shots at G.E. Smith now?"
01:13:18;01:13:19;"Absolutely."
01:13:19;01:13:21;"We're taking G.E. Smith shots?"
01:13:21;01:13:26;"I'm taking shots at Hard Rock Cafe blues guitar players."
01:13:26;01:13:28;"Not interesting."
01:13:28;01:13:29;"Oh dear."
01:13:29;01:13:31;"I'm sorry, Steve. We're getting off on the wrong foot here."
01:13:31;01:13:32;"I didn't know."
01:13:32;01:13:35;"The only way to settle this is, Stephen, can you make Jake"
01:13:35;01:13:39;"a playlist of your top 25 even flows?"
01:13:39;01:13:42;"Try to spread them out over the last 30 years."
01:13:42;01:13:44;"Your top 25 even flows."
01:13:44;01:13:46;"Jake."
01:13:46;01:13:48;"laughs"
01:13:48;01:13:50;"Oh, feelin'"
01:13:50;01:13:54;"Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete"
01:13:54;01:13:56;"Yeah"
01:13:56;01:13:59;"Oh, feelin'"
01:13:59;01:14:01;"Maybe he'll see a little better"
01:14:01;01:14:03;"Saturdays"
01:14:03;01:14:05;"Oh, yeah"
01:14:05;01:14:08;"Oh, head down"
01:14:08;01:14:10;"Faces and he sees time again"
01:14:10;01:14:12;"Ain't that familiar"
01:14:12;01:14:14;"Oh, yeah"
01:14:14;01:14:17;"Oh, no"
01:14:17;01:14:19;"And he can't help when he's happy"
01:14:19;01:14:21;"Looks insane"
01:14:21;01:14:23;"Mmm!"
01:14:23;01:14:33;"guitar solo"
01:14:33;01:14:37;"Even so"
01:14:37;01:14:41;"After all my butterflies"
01:14:41;01:14:43;"Mmm"
01:14:43;01:14:46;"Oh, he don't know"
01:14:46;01:14:48;"So he chases them away"
01:14:48;01:14:50;"Yeah"
01:14:50;01:14:53;"Oh, oh, something"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"Yeah"
01:14:55;01:14:59;"He'll begin his life again"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"Life again"
01:15:03;01:15:05;"When we saw Pearl Jam at the Forum,"
01:15:05;01:15:07;"I had never seen Pearl Jam before,"
01:15:07;01:15:10;"and I gotta say, I was so charmed with Vetter."
01:15:10;01:15:12;"I mean, to me, Vetter is the band."
01:15:12;01:15:14;"He was such an incredible frontman."
01:15:14;01:15:16;"Great banter."
01:15:16;01:15:18;"I think we covered this on the show."
01:15:18;01:15:20;"He told this whole story about going,"
01:15:20;01:15:22;"trying to go see Pink Floyd and the Wall era."
01:15:22;01:15:24;"His buddy lost one of the tickets."
01:15:24;01:15:26;"He just sat in this parking lot stoned all night."
01:15:26;01:15:28;"And the way he told it,"
01:15:28;01:15:30;"this nice, kind of drawn-out five-minute anecdote."
01:15:30;01:15:32;"He won me over."
01:15:32;01:15:34;"I mean, hell of a frontman."
01:15:34;01:15:36;"There's no band without Vetter."
01:15:36;01:15:38;"That, to me, Vetter is the Jerry,"
01:15:38;01:15:40;"even though there's no Jerry."
01:15:40;01:15:42;"Well, can I just say, too, that because of Vetter,"
01:15:42;01:15:44;"I think it was like '06,"
01:15:44;01:15:46;"when Pearl Jam played,"
01:15:46;01:15:48;"I think it was Columbus, Ohio,"
01:15:48;01:15:50;"Robert Pollard opened for,"
01:15:50;01:15:52;"the Robert Pollard Solar Band,"
01:15:52;01:15:54;"opened for Pearl Jam,"
01:15:54;01:15:56;"and they played Bob O'Reilly together."
01:15:56;01:15:58;"Like, Robert Pollard sang it with Pearl Jam."
01:15:58;01:16:00;"So, because of Eddie Vetter,"
01:16:00;01:16:02;"Robert Pollard, guided by voices,"
01:16:02;01:16:04;"got to sing Bob O'Reilly in an arena."
01:16:04;01:16:06;"So I feel like any Pearl Jam skeptic,"
01:16:06;01:16:08;"from the time I was a kid,"
01:16:08;01:16:10;"from an indie rock world,"
01:16:10;01:16:12;"ought to be able to recognize,"
01:16:12;01:16:14;"we all want to hear Robert Pollard sing Bob O'Reilly"
01:16:14;01:16:16;"in a huge room,"
01:16:16;01:16:18;"and it's because of Eddie Vetter."
01:16:18;01:16:20;"You know, so, that's another thing that you--"
01:16:20;01:16:22;"Just to tie the worlds together,"
01:16:22;01:16:24;"Now you're just brown-nosing."
01:16:24;01:16:26;"I'm trying to bring Jake back here,"
01:16:26;01:16:28;"because, well, okay, well--"
01:16:28;01:16:30;"This is one of the funniest situations."
01:16:30;01:16:32;"This is the worst,"
01:16:32;01:16:34;"the worst situation I've ever been in."
01:16:34;01:16:36;"I mean, I'm not saying it's the worst,"
01:16:36;01:16:38;"but this is the worst first date."
01:16:38;01:16:40;"I know it's not a first date."
01:16:40;01:16:42;"It's all love."
01:16:42;01:16:44;"It's really sit down."
01:16:44;01:16:46;"We haven't even started the top five, guys."
01:16:46;01:16:48;"That's funny, too."
01:16:48;01:16:50;"That's such a genre of a tweet,"
01:16:50;01:16:52;"or a social media post,"
01:16:52;01:16:54;"where somebody's like,"
01:16:54;01:16:56;"""I think I'm sitting next to the worst Tinder date of all time."""
01:16:56;01:16:58;"You know, like, the girl's vegan,"
01:16:58;01:17:00;"and the guy just told her,"
01:17:00;01:17:02;"""She just got back from a hunting in the woods,"
01:17:02;01:17:04;"and took down a 5.0."""
01:17:04;01:17:06;"It's like that."
01:17:06;01:17:08;"It's like, ""Hey, guys, I think I'm at the worst Tinder date of all time."""
01:17:08;01:17:10;"This dude just opened"
01:17:10;01:17:12;"with ""How much he hates Mike McCready of Pearl Jam,"""
01:17:12;01:17:14;"and the girl just said,"
01:17:14;01:17:16;"""That's actually my favorite member of the band."""
01:17:16;01:17:18;"And they're both 22,"
01:17:18;01:17:20;"which is pretty cool."
01:17:20;01:17:22;"22-year-olds talking PJ on the first date."
01:17:22;01:17:24;"It's two 45-year-old guys talking PJ."
01:17:24;01:17:26;"We're both 77, I think."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"Right, Seton?"
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Yeah, you're February of '77."
01:17:30;01:17:32;"I'm September."
01:17:32;01:17:34;"So, I'm English town."
01:17:34;01:17:36;"Nice."
01:17:36;01:17:38;"In February, you would have been like"
01:17:38;01:17:40;"Madison, Wisconsin,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"probably, in February '77."
01:17:42;01:17:44;"I just brought up the power of the dead."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"I'm trying to bring you back here."
01:17:46;01:17:48;"No, we're good, man."
01:17:48;01:17:50;"Jake likes Pearl Jam, right?"
01:17:50;01:17:52;"I do. I like Pearl Jam."
01:17:52;01:17:54;"I mean, I feel bad that McCready's taking so much ire,"
01:17:54;01:17:56;"but, okay, well, Stephen, you can definitely speak"
01:17:56;01:17:58;"to this, because I think"
01:17:58;01:18:00;"one thing I love about the book,"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"I was saying this earlier,"
01:18:02;01:18:04;"and why I think your book is great for even"
01:18:04;01:18:06;"Pearl Jam skeptics, maybe especially"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"for Pearl Jam skeptics, just because it's like"
01:18:08;01:18:10;"you give people lots of context."
01:18:10;01:18:12;"Like, you'll go off on a whole thing"
01:18:12;01:18:14;"about Stone Temple Pilots, or what was happening"
01:18:14;01:18:16;"in the larger music world."
01:18:16;01:18:18;"You also really are interested in the"
01:18:18;01:18:20;"band dynamics and stuff like that,"
01:18:20;01:18:22;"so you kind of keep it interesting from a human"
01:18:22;01:18:24;"perspective. Can you just"
01:18:24;01:18:26;"give us your general take about"
01:18:26;01:18:28;"the humans in this band,"
01:18:28;01:18:30;"the elements of this band that come together?"
01:18:30;01:18:32;"Vedder is the type, ""Oh, guys,"
01:18:32;01:18:34;"it'd be cool to get Robert Pollard to come sing"
01:18:34;01:18:36;"Bob O'Reilly with us."" What do the other people,"
01:18:36;01:18:38;"such as the Mike McCready, represent?"
01:18:38;01:18:40;"Because, obviously, it's only Pearl Jam"
01:18:40;01:18:42;"with all of these people. Can you just give us"
01:18:42;01:18:44;"your kind of bird's eye view of"
01:18:44;01:18:46;"how Pearl Jam reached"
01:18:46;01:18:48;"this kind of harmony that makes them them?"
01:18:48;01:18:50;"What are the elements, the people, the"
01:18:50;01:18:52;"influences, you know? Yeah, so"
01:18:52;01:18:54;"there's a phrase that I seize upon"
01:18:54;01:18:56;"early in the book that"
01:18:56;01:18:58;"came from Matt Cameron, where he"
01:18:58;01:19:00;"described Pearl Jam as ""punk rock,"
01:19:00;01:19:02;"arena rock,"" which"
01:19:02;01:19:04;"in my interpretation"
01:19:04;01:19:06;"is this idea of"
01:19:06;01:19:08;"simultaneously being a band that"
01:19:08;01:19:10;"can play arenas and stadiums and"
01:19:10;01:19:12;"sort of be reminiscent"
01:19:12;01:19:14;"of the bands of the past that"
01:19:14;01:19:16;"would play those types of rooms."
01:19:16;01:19:18;"You know, The Who, Zeppelin,"
01:19:18;01:19:20;"Bruce Springsteen, and"
01:19:20;01:19:22;"at the same time, operate"
01:19:22;01:19:24;"like a band"
01:19:24;01:19:26;"that comes from the punk rock"
01:19:26;01:19:28;"world, you know? Specifically"
01:19:28;01:19:30;"the 80s indie world"
01:19:30;01:19:32;"that certainly people"
01:19:32;01:19:34;"like Jeff Amitt and Stone Gossard came"
01:19:34;01:19:36;"from, you know, playing in"
01:19:36;01:19:38;"Green River, you know, very"
01:19:38;01:19:40;"sort of early"
01:19:40;01:19:42;"Seattle punk band, you know, from the"
01:19:42;01:19:44;"mid-80s into the late 80s."
01:19:44;01:19:46;"And I think that that's"
01:19:46;01:19:48;"part, that's a big part of why"
01:19:48;01:19:50;"they've been able to stick"
01:19:50;01:19:52;"around for a long time. They"
01:19:52;01:19:54;"can be a band that"
01:19:54;01:19:56;"if you want to see"
01:19:56;01:19:58;"The Who or Aerosmith or"
01:19:58;01:20:00;"a band like that in a"
01:20:00;01:20:02;"big room, and that"
01:20:02;01:20:04;"can hit like that and deliver"
01:20:04;01:20:06;"like that, even in ways that"
01:20:06;01:20:08;"like Jake was talking about, the House of"
01:20:08;01:20:10;"Rock thing, I mean, that is"
01:20:10;01:20:12;"part of the rock and roll tree, you know? And I"
01:20:12;01:20:14;"wouldn't say House of Rock. I would say Mike McCready"
01:20:14;01:20:16;"is more of like the Jimi Hendrix,"
01:20:16;01:20:18;"Stevie Ray Vaughan"
01:20:18;01:20:20;"type style of guitar playing"
01:20:20;01:20:22;"and maybe Stevie Ray Vaughan would fall more into that"
01:20:22;01:20:24;"House of Rock thing, but"
01:20:24;01:20:26;"that is part of like the arena rock tree."
01:20:26;01:20:28;"So they can be that, but they can also be"
01:20:28;01:20:30;"a band that has a"
01:20:30;01:20:32;"lineage that does come from like the indie rock"
01:20:32;01:20:34;"world and maybe they carry themselves"
01:20:34;01:20:36;"more like a band"
01:20:36;01:20:38;"that would be from there."
01:20:38;01:20:40;"And it seems like an impossible"
01:20:40;01:20:42;"combination"
01:20:42;01:20:44;"to pull off and I think Pearl Jam"
01:20:44;01:20:46;"over the course of their career, it was always about trying"
01:20:46;01:20:48;"to figure out a way to pull that off."
01:20:48;01:20:50;"Because it is a really hard"
01:20:50;01:20:52;"balancing act to"
01:20:52;01:20:54;"execute, but I think they really did"
01:20:54;01:20:56;"figure it out in the long run. Because like you"
01:20:56;01:20:58;"look at them now and you"
01:20:58;01:21:00;"just saw them at the, was it at the"
01:21:00;01:21:02;"Forum in LA? Yeah, Forum."
01:21:02;01:21:04;"They can play the Forum,"
01:21:04;01:21:06;"they can sell it out, but"
01:21:06;01:21:08;"at the same time, they're like, they"
01:21:08;01:21:10;"have like really no media profile at all."
01:21:10;01:21:12;"You know? Like when I've been talking about this book,"
01:21:12;01:21:14;"I often compare Eddie Vedder"
01:21:14;01:21:16;"to Dave Grohl, you know?"
01:21:16;01:21:18;"And no shots at Dave Grohl, I mean"
01:21:18;01:21:20;"he's great, but like Dave Grohl, like when they promote"
01:21:20;01:21:22;"whenever there's like a new Foo Fighters"
01:21:22;01:21:24;"record, he's like all over the place. He's on"
01:21:24;01:21:26;"award shows, he's on talk shows,"
01:21:26;01:21:28;"very ubiquitous. Whereas"
01:21:28;01:21:30;"Eddie Vedder has really avoided"
01:21:30;01:21:32;"that for a long time. And yet"
01:21:32;01:21:34;"he still has the same"
01:21:34;01:21:36;"rock star friends, you know, he"
01:21:36;01:21:38;"can still play the same big places,"
01:21:38;01:21:40;"but it's like, they can be invisible"
01:21:40;01:21:42;"and very visible"
01:21:42;01:21:44;"simultaneously. And"
01:21:44;01:21:46;"again, that's a really hard thing to do,"
01:21:46;01:21:48;"but they've been able to pull it off for a long time."
01:21:48;01:21:50;"And I think that's the key to like"
01:21:50;01:21:52;"their long term survival."
01:21:52;01:21:54;"And it is interesting, like, I feel"
01:21:54;01:21:56;"like I've noticed more people,"
01:21:56;01:21:58;"maybe it's just a natural function of"
01:21:58;01:22:00;"time, becoming"
01:22:00;01:22:02;"kind of interested in Pearl Jam, maybe just"
01:22:02;01:22:04;"because they're hitting that 30 year mark"
01:22:04;01:22:06;"and people get interested in stuff"
01:22:06;01:22:08;"when it's been around 30 years and start to be like,"
01:22:08;01:22:10;"whether you like them back in the day,"
01:22:10;01:22:12;"were agnostic, disliked them,"
01:22:12;01:22:14;"I feel like there's been some growing energy"
01:22:14;01:22:16;"lately. Maybe I'm just speaking about"
01:22:16;01:22:18;"myself, but we're just kind of like, oh yeah,"
01:22:18;01:22:20;"Pearl Jam, I'll go see Pearl Jam. Oh yeah, I've got"
01:22:20;01:22:22;"a buddy that goes to Pearl Jam every time they come to town."
01:22:22;01:22:24;"As you promote this book and talk"
01:22:24;01:22:26;"about it, is there a bit of a Pearl Jam"
01:22:26;01:22:28;"renaissance happening?"
01:22:28;01:22:30;"I don't know. I mean, there are"
01:22:30;01:22:32;"really interesting battle in that regard because"
01:22:32;01:22:34;"I don't want to put too much"
01:22:34;01:22:36;"weight on this, but like Pitchfork"
01:22:36;01:22:38;"just put out a new"
01:22:38;01:22:40;"list of like the best albums"
01:22:40;01:22:42;"of the 90s. 150"
01:22:42;01:22:44;"albums. Oh, I haven't seen that."
01:22:44;01:22:46;"Very controversial. And there's like no"
01:22:46;01:22:48;"Pearl Jam albums on there. I think"
01:22:48;01:22:50;"Zero Pearl Jam. Zero Pearl Jam"
01:22:50;01:22:52;"Zero Pearl Jam. Versus?"
01:22:52;01:22:54;"Nothing from Pearl Jam."
01:22:54;01:22:56;"Wow. They did put Corduroy"
01:22:56;01:22:58;"on their songs list"
01:22:58;01:23:00;"this week, which actually I was"
01:23:00;01:23:02;"kind of surprised by because"
01:23:02;01:23:04;"Pitchfork generally,"
01:23:04;01:23:06;"if you look at their archives, like they're"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"not very positive"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"toward that band, but"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"it is interesting. I don't feel like they've really"
01:23:12;01:23:14;"they don't seem like the band"
01:23:14;01:23:16;"that is like canonical to"
01:23:16;01:23:18;"younger generations yet in the way that"
01:23:18;01:23:20;"Nirvana is. And I'm curious about this"
01:23:20;01:23:22;"not having seen this list. Like for instance,"
01:23:22;01:23:24;"is Nevermind in the top 10?"
01:23:24;01:23:26;"It is in the top 10,"
01:23:26;01:23:28;"but like Holes live through this"
01:23:28;01:23:30;"is like two spots higher, which was"
01:23:30;01:23:32;"interesting to me. Oh my god."
01:23:32;01:23:34;"Like Nevermind. That is so funny."
01:23:34;01:23:36;"Nevermind was number 10."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"It's an interesting top 10 list for the"
01:23:38;01:23:40;"albums because like Loveless,"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"the My Bloody Valentine record"
01:23:42;01:23:44;"was number one, which actually surprised me"
01:23:44;01:23:46;"a little bit. That's kind of old school."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"Exactly. And then like Lauryn Hill"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"was number two. OK Computer"
01:23:50;01:23:52;"was number three. I forget what"
01:23:52;01:23:54;"comes after that, but"
01:23:54;01:23:56;"OK, so those are all like, none of those"
01:23:56;01:23:58;"are surprises that they'd be in the top 10."
01:23:58;01:24:00;"Again, perhaps the particular order"
01:24:00;01:24:02;"is irrelevant. It's more like,"
01:24:02;01:24:04;"alright, what's top 10? What's top 50?"
01:24:04;01:24:06;"I don't know."
01:24:08;01:24:12;"♪ You're finally here and I'm a mess ♪"
01:24:12;01:24:15;"♪ I'll take your interest back ♪"
01:24:15;01:24:20;"♪ Can't let you roam inside my head ♪"
01:24:20;01:24:23;"♪ I don't wanna take what you can't give ♪"
01:24:23;01:24:27;"♪ I would rather starve than eat your bread ♪"
01:24:27;01:24:30;"♪ I would rather run but I can't walk ♪"
01:24:30;01:24:35;"♪ Guess I'll lie alone just like before ♪"
01:24:35;01:24:37;"Where was Dirt?"
01:24:37;01:24:38;"I don't know if Dirt made it,"
01:24:38;01:24:41;"actually, it's funny 'cause like you see these lists"
01:24:41;01:24:44;"and like you, and I hate that I do this"
01:24:44;01:24:48;"because it annoys me like if I make my own list"
01:24:48;01:24:50;"and people do this, but like you do the control F"
01:24:50;01:24:52;"and you put in the thing that you are curious,"
01:24:52;01:24:55;"like where did this land?"
01:24:55;01:24:57;"I think I looked up like Siamese Dream."
01:24:57;01:24:59;"I mean, I was half kidding you by suggesting that."
01:24:59;01:25:03;"I assume Dirt is not on the list, if I had to guess."
01:25:03;01:25:06;"They recently did like a Pitchfork review on Dirt."
01:25:06;01:25:08;"They did like a, it's funny that we're doing"
01:25:08;01:25:09;"so much Dirt talk."
01:25:09;01:25:11;"Dirt is not on the list."
01:25:11;01:25:12;"Oh, no Dirt?"
01:25:12;01:25:13;"Dirt is not on the list."
01:25:13;01:25:15;"Nick, do you think of B1000 and Alien Lanes?"
01:25:15;01:25:16;"I can tell you."
01:25:16;01:25:17;"Okay, thank you, Steven."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"I can tell you, Alien Lanes is not on the list."
01:25:19;01:25:22;"B1000, I believe is about 129."
01:25:22;01:25:24;"Maybe we can confirm that, but I think it was about--"
01:25:24;01:25:27;"We're talking about the most underrated rock bands"
01:25:27;01:25:29;"of all time, Alice in Chains and GBB."
01:25:29;01:25:31;"(laughing)"
01:25:31;01:25:33;"AIC and GBB."
01:25:33;01:25:33;"How about this?"
01:25:34;01:25:37;"B1000, 123."
01:25:37;01:25:39;"GBB, underrated."
01:25:39;01:25:41;"MBV, overrated."
01:25:41;01:25:43;"Can I just say too, since we're talking"
01:25:43;01:25:48;"about the Pitchfork list here, Octoon Baby was like 118."
01:25:48;01:25:49;"I think that's way too low."
01:25:49;01:25:51;"Can we talk about U2 for a second?"
01:25:51;01:25:52;"Sure."
01:25:52;01:25:54;"I think they're way underrated."
01:25:54;01:25:59;"I think Octoon Baby is for sure at least a top five album"
01:25:59;01:26:02;"of the 90s, as far as I'm concerned."
01:26:02;01:26:04;"Well, I wouldn't go top five, but I would--"
01:26:04;01:26:06;"I would for sure for myself."
01:26:06;01:26:10;"I think that album is a masterpiece."
01:26:10;01:26:11;"No, I love it."
01:26:11;01:26:11;"It's very good, but I mean,"
01:26:11;01:26:14;"I guess as I know this is exact type of thing--"
01:26:14;01:26:16;"Guys, I just want you to take a guess."
01:26:16;01:26:17;"Yeah."
01:26:17;01:26:19;"Steven, you do not get to answer since you know the list."
01:26:19;01:26:22;"Where do you think Dookie falls?"
01:26:22;01:26:23;"Hmm."
01:26:23;01:26:25;"Beautiful album."
01:26:25;01:26:27;"Okay, it was a number one, it was a number two,"
01:26:27;01:26:29;"and it was a number three, so I'm guessing four."
01:26:29;01:26:30;"I'm gonna guess--"
01:26:30;01:26:30;"Just kidding."
01:26:30;01:26:33;"One, 115."
01:26:33;01:26:35;"I'm gonna say not on the list."
01:26:35;01:26:37;"I mean, that would be incredible if I did--"
01:26:37;01:26:38;"if it was a trick question."
01:26:38;01:26:41;"No, it's-- what did you say, Jake?"
01:26:41;01:26:42;"115."
01:26:42;01:26:44;"Ooh, it's 111."
01:26:44;01:26:45;"Wow, good guess."
01:26:45;01:26:46;"Really good, Jake."
01:26:46;01:26:47;"Thank you."
01:26:47;01:26:48;"I think like--"
01:26:48;01:26:51;"Arthur Russell's Another Thought, that's 115."
01:26:51;01:26:53;"That's 90s?"
01:26:53;01:26:56;"Wait, was that like the 80s?"
01:26:56;01:26:57;"That doesn't count."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"94."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"It's like a reissue?"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Where is Siamese Dream?"
01:27:02;01:27:04;"It's like 98, I believe."
01:27:04;01:27:05;"[bleep]"
01:27:05;01:27:06;"Damn, you're so good."
01:27:06;01:27:07;"I mean, you're--"
01:27:07;01:27:08;"yes, it's 98."
01:27:08;01:27:10;"Well, because this was something I looked up--"
01:27:10;01:27:11;"It's incredible, Steven."
01:27:11;01:27:15;"I looked that up specifically because I felt like, again,"
01:27:15;01:27:19;"as a aging music writer, I thought like that was way"
01:27:19;01:27:24;"too low on the list because I was DMing with various people"
01:27:24;01:27:25;"about this list."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Someone brought up Dookie, and someone"
01:27:26;01:27:29;"brought up the self-titled Rage Against the Machine."
01:27:29;01:27:31;"This album, like the self-titled?"
01:27:31;01:27:33;"Where do you think that fell?"
01:27:33;01:27:35;"I'm going to guess 43."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"Yeah, I was going to say 40-something."
01:27:37;01:27:39;"120."
01:27:39;01:27:40;"Ouch."
01:27:40;01:27:41;"Oh, deep."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"Which I'm not even a huge Rage Against the Machine fan,"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"but that seems way too low for me."
01:27:47;01:27:50;"OK, I remember the last time, like two years ago,"
01:27:50;01:27:53;"during COVID, Rolling Stone did the top 500 albums of all time"
01:27:53;01:27:56;"and the top indie rock album."
01:27:56;01:27:58;"Do you guys remember what it was?"
01:27:58;01:27:59;"Top indie rock album."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"It was a Matador release in the '90s,"
01:28:01;01:28:03;"and it wasn't Pavement, and it wasn't GBV."
01:28:03;01:28:04;"It would be Liz Phair and Sebastian."
01:28:04;01:28:06;"Yes, it was Liz Phair."
01:28:06;01:28:07;"Yeah, yeah."
01:28:07;01:28:09;"Liz Phair was the top indie rock album on the top 500 list"
01:28:09;01:28:10;"two years ago."
01:28:10;01:28:15;"I'm going to guess Exile and Guyville is number nine."
01:28:15;01:28:16;"Number four."
01:28:16;01:28:17;"Oh!"
01:28:17;01:28:17;"That was number four?"
01:28:17;01:28:20;"Oh, it took the Dookie slot."
01:28:20;01:28:24;"And they threw Dookie all the way, you know."
01:28:24;01:28:25;"This is going to be so all over the place."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"It's possible that we're done talking about Pearl Jam."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"Maybe that's a good thing."
01:28:28;01:28:31;"You've been talking about Pearl Jam so much lately, right,"
01:28:31;01:28:33;"Steven?"
01:28:33;01:28:35;"I mean, I'm happy to talk about Pearl Jam"
01:28:35;01:28:37;"till the cows come home."
01:28:37;01:28:40;"Well, everybody, look, check out the book, everybody."
01:28:40;01:28:41;"I love all of Steven's books."
01:28:41;01:28:43;"I haven't got the PJ book yet."
01:28:43;01:28:44;"I'm going to get it."
01:28:44;01:28:48;"I'm going to read it, despite my misgivings of Mike McReady."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"I'm psyched to read this book."
01:28:49;01:28:52;"Steven's a great writer, iconic band."
01:28:52;01:28:54;"I'll hit up the PJ thread."
01:28:54;01:28:56;"We'll add Steven to that thread if he wants."
01:28:56;01:28:57;"Maybe he's PJ'd out."
01:28:58;01:28:58;"I don't know."
01:28:58;01:29:00;"I mean, the thread, man."
01:29:00;01:29:02;"I mean, the Alice in Chains thread."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Oh, you know what I was going to say?"
01:29:04;01:29:06;"Jake, we should buy it for Brian and Adam,"
01:29:06;01:29:08;"the other two guys on the list."
01:29:08;01:29:11;"We should buy them Steven's book as a group chat present."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"That's a great call."
01:29:12;01:29:16;"Before I click out of this window, time out of mind."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"Oh, I was just thinking about that."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Is it on the list?"
01:29:19;01:29:20;"And if so, where does it fall?"
01:29:20;01:29:21;"Well, I follow the Joker--"
01:29:21;01:29:22;"I think it's going to be high."
01:29:22;01:29:23;"I think it's going to be high."
01:29:23;01:29:24;"It's going to be--"
01:29:24;01:29:26;"well, I think, first of all, Bob Dylan's"
01:29:26;01:29:28;"""Greatest Hits, Volume 3,"" which came out in the '90s."
01:29:28;01:29:30;"That's probably number five."
01:29:30;01:29:33;"And then I think, time out of mind, an actual studio album."
01:29:33;01:29:35;"I think it's going to be like 28."
01:29:35;01:29:38;"Because I follow the ""Jokerman"" podcast Twitter feed,"
01:29:38;01:29:40;"it's pretty much my entire Twitter feed"
01:29:40;01:29:43;"is basically just Bob Dylan at this point."
01:29:43;01:29:44;"Not on the list."
01:29:44;01:29:45;"68."
01:29:45;01:29:46;"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
01:29:46;01:29:47;"I guess I misread the tweets."
01:29:47;01:29:49;"So you were--"
01:29:49;01:29:50;"yeah."
01:29:50;01:29:50;"But I was a bit close."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"I mean, I just wanted--"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"You were very close."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Not as close as Jake and Dookie, but it's interesting."
01:29:54;01:29:56;"But I think you know it's in the top 100."
01:29:56;01:29:57;"Yeah, we were talking about a lot of records"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"that were falling outside the top 100."
01:29:59;01:30:01;"I do think time out of mind's having a moment."
01:30:01;01:30:04;"And I wanted to say, just speaking of Steven's writing"
01:30:04;01:30:06;"and the fact that we went so deep on Bob Dylan"
01:30:06;01:30:10;"recently on the program, one piece of Steven's writing"
01:30:10;01:30:13;"that I really enjoy and that I found myself returning to a lot"
01:30:13;01:30:17;"in my post Bob Dylan ""Greatest Hits, Volume 3"" mania"
01:30:17;01:30:20;"was Steven's ""Every Bob Dylan Studio Album Ranked,"""
01:30:20;01:30:22;"which he wrote for Uproxx."
01:30:22;01:30:23;"Yes."
01:30:23;01:30:26;"And I'm hoping that all of the ""Time Crisis"" fans"
01:30:26;01:30:30;"who got into middle period Bob Dylan via our two-parter--"
01:30:30;01:30:33;"and maybe you're interested in going through because--"
01:30:33;01:30:36;"Can I just say, by the way, that I love that you did"
01:30:36;01:30:40;"a middle period Bob Dylan two-parter?"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"That's so inspiring to me."
01:30:42;01:30:45;"I love that this has become so normalized."
01:30:45;01:30:46;"I was just going to say, too, I mean,"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"I was joking about this with the ""Joker"" men guys"
01:30:49;01:30:52;"that Froggy came a-courting from ""Good"
01:30:52;01:30:55;"As I've Been to You,"" should have been on the songs list."
01:30:55;01:30:58;"That's some of his early '90s work."
01:30:58;01:31:00;"His cover of ""Froggy Came a-Courting,"""
01:31:00;01:31:04;"that was woefully underappreciated"
01:31:04;01:31:08;"on the best songs list of the '90s."
01:31:08;01:31:09;"Where's ""Wiggle Wiggle?"""
01:31:09;01:31:10;"I mean, come on."
01:31:10;01:31:11;"Right."
01:31:11;01:31:13;"Well, I mean, all kidding aside,"
01:31:13;01:31:16;"you could have put ""Lovesick"" or ""Standing"
01:31:16;01:31:21;"in the Doorway"" on that songs list as legit great songs."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"But anyway, Ezra, I'm sorry."
01:31:23;01:31:24;"Sorry to interrupt you."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Well, I was just saying, it's a great piece of writing."
01:31:26;01:31:28;"But one thing I should say, and I don't know if, Jake,"
01:31:28;01:31:32;"if you've seen it, but because via Bob Dylan's career"
01:31:32;01:31:35;"since ""Volume 3,"" me and Jake got so deep into ""Brownsville"
01:31:35;01:31:40;"Girl,"" I was a little bit sad to see that you put ""Knocked"
01:31:40;01:31:45;"Out, Loaded,"" dead last on your list, number 39."
01:31:45;01:31:47;"And you give it up for ""Brownsville Girl."""
01:31:47;01:31:50;"And to be fair, I do have to say, Stephen's writing,"
01:31:50;01:31:52;"it really comes from a fan place."
01:31:52;01:31:54;"Over and over again in the list, you make it clear"
01:31:54;01:31:56;"that you love all Bob Dylan's music."
01:31:56;01:31:58;"And it's kind of a matter of which day you make the list."
01:31:58;01:32:01;"But you did put ""Knocked Out, Loaded"" dead last."
01:32:01;01:32:02;"And I love ""Knocked Out, Loaded."""
01:32:02;01:32:04;"You know, I mean, it's like not a knock on that album."
01:32:04;01:32:06;"It's like if you're going to rank Bob Dylan albums,"
01:32:06;01:32:08;"something has to be last."
01:32:08;01:32:10;"It doesn't mean you don't like it."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"In a way--"
01:32:11;01:32:15;"If you had to make your top 200 albums of all time,"
01:32:15;01:32:18;"""Knocked Out, Loaded"" would be number 39, number 40."
01:32:18;01:32:20;"Right, exactly."
01:32:20;01:32:23;"OK, computer, number 41, Sergeant Pepper."
01:32:23;01:32:27;"But it's just-- every Bob Dylan album is one through 39."
01:32:27;01:32:28;"Exactly."
01:32:28;01:32:30;"I mean, because the thing with Bob"
01:32:30;01:32:34;"is that every album of his that you think is bad"
01:32:34;01:32:37;"will become your favorite album in like five years."
01:32:37;01:32:39;"Like, that's the thing I realized with him."
01:32:39;01:32:42;"Because honestly, the thing I would be least interested"
01:32:42;01:32:47;"in putting on is something like ""Triplicate,"" which"
01:32:47;01:32:50;"is his triple album of standards."
01:32:50;01:32:53;"And like each album is like a half hour long."
01:32:53;01:32:56;"And it's the same tempo."
01:32:56;01:32:58;"But I know that at some point, that"
01:32:58;01:33:02;"is going to be the album I am most obsessed with."
01:33:02;01:33:05;"Because that's just how Bob Dylan is."
01:33:05;01:33:07;"That was ""Evans Doesn't Miss."""
01:33:07;01:33:09;"Wasn't that ""Evans"" number one?"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"Yes."
01:33:10;01:33:10;"Yeah."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"He was trolling."
01:33:11;01:33:13;"I mean--"
01:33:13;01:33:14;"But he may not be, though."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"No, I mean--"
01:33:15;01:33:17;"""Jokerman"" mindset is deep."
01:33:17;01:33:21;"It affects-- it's like a zombie apocalypse."
01:33:21;01:33:24;"It affects us all eventually."
01:33:24;01:33:26;"I really tried to get into ""Tempest"""
01:33:26;01:33:28;"based on the ""Jokerman's"" recommendation."
01:33:28;01:33:30;"And it definitely has its moments."
01:33:30;01:33:36;"Well, there was this movie I seen one time about a man"
01:33:36;01:33:37;"riding across the desert."
01:33:37;01:33:39;"And it starred Gregory Peck."
01:33:39;01:33:45;"He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name."
01:33:45;01:33:48;"Pardon me, sir."
01:33:48;01:33:51;"The townspeople wanted to thrust that kid down him,"
01:33:51;01:33:55;"string him up by the neck."
01:33:55;01:33:58;"Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp."
01:33:58;01:34:05;"As the dying gunfighter lay under sun and gas"
01:34:05;01:34:08;"for his last breath."
01:34:08;01:34:12;"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me."
01:34:12;01:34:17;"Fair and square, I want him to feel what it's like to have"
01:34:17;01:34:21;"a moment face his death."
01:34:21;01:34:25;"Well, I keep seeing this stuff, and it just comes a-rolling in."
01:34:25;01:34:34;"And you know it blows right through me like a ball of chain."
01:34:34;01:34:37;"You know, I can't believe we've lived so long,"
01:34:37;01:34:39;"and are still so far apart."
01:34:40;01:34:44;"Remember if you keep calling after me like a rolling train."
01:34:44;01:34:48;"I will say, and I know Jake, you can relate to this,"
01:34:48;01:34:49;"because we talk about it a lot."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"Like, what records are you actually going to throw on?"
01:34:51;01:34:53;"And Steven, before you came on, Jake"
01:34:53;01:34:56;"was saying he listens to Dirt a lot more than he listens"
01:34:56;01:34:59;"to Nevermind, because the weight of history on Nevermind"
01:34:59;01:35:00;"just makes it--"
01:35:00;01:35:03;"you're just less likely to want to throw it on than you--"
01:35:03;01:35:05;"at least for Jake, you'd want to Dirt."
01:35:05;01:35:06;"And I think that's a really good point."
01:35:07;01:35:08;"At least for Jake, you'd want to Dirt."
01:35:08;01:35:10;"And I wonder if you ever feel this way,"
01:35:10;01:35:13;"and this might be different than your top Bob albums list."
01:35:13;01:35:16;"I've just found lately, I'd rather"
01:35:16;01:35:19;"listen to Shot of Love, Infidels,"
01:35:19;01:35:22;"Knocked Out, Loaded, than any of the classic '60s stuff."
01:35:22;01:35:25;"And I've been feeling that way kind of for a long time."
01:35:25;01:35:27;"I'm sure it'll go back later."
01:35:27;01:35:29;"I'd rather listen to '80s or '90s, Bob,"
01:35:29;01:35:34;"than the objectively more classic, tasteful '60s"
01:35:34;01:35:35;"and '70s stuff."
01:35:35;01:35:36;"You ever feel that way?"
01:35:36;01:35:37;"Oh, absolutely."
01:35:37;01:35:40;"And that's what is so great about Bob Dylan,"
01:35:40;01:35:45;"is that he has so many albums in his catalog"
01:35:45;01:35:48;"that still feel unclaimed in a way."
01:35:48;01:35:54;"And for people like us, Shot of Love, or Empire Burlesque,"
01:35:54;01:35:58;"or even an album like Street Legal or something,"
01:35:58;01:35:59;"they feel like classics already."
01:35:59;01:36:02;"But in the larger scheme of things,"
01:36:02;01:36:04;"they're still under-discussed."
01:36:04;01:36:07;"Whereas an album like Blonde on Blonde, I mean,"
01:36:07;01:36:09;"we've all read--"
01:36:09;01:36:10;"It's a museum piece."
01:36:10;01:36:14;"Yeah, we've all-- and look, Blonde on Blonde, if I had--"
01:36:14;01:36:17;"to me, that's the greatest album ever made."
01:36:17;01:36:18;"And I will say that."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"That's your number one?"
01:36:20;01:36:23;"Yeah, if you're asking me to pick the greatest"
01:36:23;01:36:26;"album of all time, I would say Blonde on Blonde."
01:36:26;01:36:29;"And if you put it on, I would enjoy it."
01:36:29;01:36:32;"I still listen to the classics, too."
01:36:32;01:36:35;"But when you listen to Shot of Love,"
01:36:35;01:36:38;"there's just not as much narrative baggage"
01:36:38;01:36:40;"attached to an album like that."
01:36:40;01:36:44;"You don't hear like, Grail Marcus's voice in your head"
01:36:44;01:36:46;"commenting on it as you're listening to it."
01:36:46;01:36:51;"And this is true of other sort of canonical classic rock"
01:36:51;01:36:55;"people, like someone like Van Morrison, for instance."
01:36:55;01:36:57;"There's this Grail Marcus book where"
01:36:57;01:37:00;"he writes about all the Van Morrison albums."
01:37:00;01:37:02;"And he's basically-- he writes at one point,"
01:37:02;01:37:07;"like, every Van Morrison album from like 1980 to 1995,"
01:37:07;01:37:09;"you don't need to listen to those at all."
01:37:09;01:37:12;"Like, they're all basically garbage."
01:37:12;01:37:14;"And I'm like, that's like one of my favorite periods"
01:37:14;01:37:15;"of Van Morrison."
01:37:15;01:37:16;"Like, I love that period."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"Beautiful vision."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"Beautiful vision."
01:37:20;01:37:21;"Yeah."
01:37:21;01:37:25;"And like, Hymns to the Silence, Common One,"
01:37:25;01:37:28;"and there's so many just beautiful records from then."
01:37:28;01:37:32;"And that's one of the very attractive things"
01:37:32;01:37:34;"about these sort of like big time artists"
01:37:34;01:37:37;"is that they have so many albums."
01:37:37;01:37:39;"And they have like entire decades of their career"
01:37:39;01:37:43;"that have been dismissed by experts."
01:37:43;01:37:46;"It's like almost like you're getting multiple artists in one."
01:37:46;01:37:47;"Right."
01:37:47;01:37:49;"The same way that there might be one person who's like,"
01:37:49;01:37:53;"yeah, I love the Beatles, but then, you know,"
01:37:53;01:37:56;"you also catch me listening to West Coast Experimental Pop"
01:37:57;01:38:00;"Group or whatever, like obscure, weirder '60s stuff."
01:38:00;01:38:01;"But with Bob Dylan or Van Morrison,"
01:38:01;01:38:03;"it's both are within the same artist."
01:38:03;01:38:05;"You can be like, oh, yeah, I'll listen."
01:38:05;01:38:07;"I'll throw Freewheel in on Once in a Blue Moon."
01:38:07;01:38:09;"But like, you have this whole decade of them."
01:38:09;01:38:10;"It's almost like being into--"
01:38:10;01:38:13;"even though, of course, there's so much continuity,"
01:38:13;01:38:16;"to be into it and finding people to talk about it with"
01:38:16;01:38:19;"is almost like being into a semi-obscure artist."
01:38:19;01:38:20;"Totally."
01:38:20;01:38:22;"You know, to talk about Empire Burlesque with somebody."
01:38:22;01:38:23;"I'll say--"
01:38:23;01:38:26;"It's like being into historically"
01:38:26;01:38:29;"significant visual artists that have"
01:38:29;01:38:32;"different phases of their career."
01:38:32;01:38:33;"You could say like Picasso."
01:38:33;01:38:36;"The Blue Period is only like five, six years."
01:38:36;01:38:37;"Right."
01:38:37;01:38:38;"The work he was doing in the '30s"
01:38:38;01:38:40;"was much different than the work he was doing in the '70s."
01:38:40;01:38:42;"If you want to go deep, you can."
01:38:42;01:38:44;"I agree."
01:38:44;01:38:45;"I think there's something interesting, though, about--"
01:38:45;01:38:48;"because I always think of like Tunnel of Love"
01:38:48;01:38:50;"as this like very important--"
01:38:50;01:38:53;"I think when it's music, if you're from a certain era,"
01:38:53;01:38:55;"at some point, that's our nostalgia."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Like even if it wasn't at the--"
01:38:56;01:39:01;"you know, it somehow connects us very specifically"
01:39:01;01:39:02;"to when we were growing up."
01:39:02;01:39:07;"I mean, my parents listened to Bob Dylan pretty religiously."
01:39:07;01:39:11;"But at some point, that '60s, '70s is not my experience"
01:39:11;01:39:12;"at all."
01:39:12;01:39:15;"And even those later albums, which were not on as much,"
01:39:15;01:39:18;"became much more of my childhood."
01:39:18;01:39:19;"Just because they were new when you came out?"
01:39:19;01:39:20;"They came--"
01:39:20;01:39:22;"Yeah, and you'd even hear it on MTV even."
01:39:23;01:39:24;"I mean, there's just something about--"
01:39:24;01:39:26;"Yeah, watch him unplugged."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"Totally."
01:39:27;01:39:29;"I like that there's two different ways you can"
01:39:29;01:39:31;"approach a deep career artist like that."
01:39:31;01:39:33;"You can either start getting into the albums that"
01:39:33;01:39:36;"come out in real time, like when you're--"
01:39:36;01:39:38;"you know, if you're like 17 and 97,"
01:39:38;01:39:40;"like check out Time Out of Mind."
01:39:40;01:39:41;"You can do it that way."
01:39:41;01:39:44;"Or you can kind of just grow up with the records."
01:39:44;01:39:47;"And actually, I have a memory of being in college"
01:39:47;01:39:50;"when I definitely was listening to Blonde on Blonde"
01:39:50;01:39:52;"all the time and Highway 61 Revisited,"
01:39:52;01:39:55;"just all like the classic, classic '60s stuff."
01:39:55;01:39:58;"And I remember hanging out with--"
01:39:58;01:40:01;"he's an interesting filmmaker, very talented guy,"
01:40:01;01:40:02;"Eugene Kotlarenko."
01:40:02;01:40:03;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:40:03;01:40:05;"I went to college with him."
01:40:05;01:40:10;"And I remember being like 19 or 20 and him just being like,"
01:40:10;01:40:12;"you ever listen to Infidels?"
01:40:12;01:40:14;"And I was like, what is that, like '80s, Bob?"
01:40:14;01:40:17;"And he was like, oh, yeah, you should listen to it."
01:40:17;01:40:18;"Great record."
01:40:18;01:40:19;"And I just remember at the time being--"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"I remember kind of bookmarking it, and I was just like--"
01:40:22;01:40:23;"and I think I tried."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"I was like, I cannot."
01:40:24;01:40:25;"That is so Eugene."
01:40:25;01:40:28;"Eugene was at Infidels head at age 18 or 19."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"Respect."
01:40:29;01:40:31;"He's like, there's a song about Israel, you're going to--"
01:40:31;01:40:32;"he's like, it's crazy."
01:40:32;01:40:35;"And he's like, you got to check it out."
01:40:35;01:40:37;"But I really have this feeling where I'm like--"
01:40:37;01:40:40;"and you know, when Bob would have been--"
01:40:40;01:40:43;"when Infidels came out, he would have been in his early 40s"
01:40:43;01:40:45;"or something, so a little bit older than me."
01:40:45;01:40:47;"I can't even fully put it into words."
01:40:47;01:40:48;"It would almost be too simple to say, well, you know,"
01:40:48;01:40:51;"you grow up, you have more experiences, you relate more."
01:40:51;01:40:53;"But it's like, I can feel my center of gravity"
01:40:53;01:40:55;"going more towards Infidels."
01:40:55;01:40:56;"There's something about it."
01:40:56;01:40:58;"I just understand it more."
01:40:58;01:41:02;"I feel more comfortable listening to it or something."
01:41:02;01:41:04;"And I really have a feeling--"
01:41:04;01:41:06;"now, I've thrown on Tempest."
01:41:06;01:41:07;"I like it."
01:41:07;01:41:10;"But I do have a feeling when I'm like old,"
01:41:10;01:41:11;"Tempest will be hitting."
01:41:11;01:41:13;"When I'm Bob's age, when he made Tempest,"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"I think I'll understand something deeper about it."
01:41:15;01:41:17;"I love that-- having that too."
01:41:17;01:41:19;"Yeah, I was just going to say that."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"I think there is something to be said too"
01:41:20;01:41:25;"about how we're talking about Knocked Out Loaded."
01:41:25;01:41:28;"And he was like 45 when that record came out."
01:41:28;01:41:30;"And I'm 45 now."
01:41:30;01:41:33;"So I feel like that makes me like that record more."
01:41:33;01:41:37;"Because there's something about me being the same age as Bob"
01:41:37;01:41:38;"when he made that record."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"It's like, I kind of understand."
01:41:40;01:41:43;"Although his experience was obviously"
01:41:43;01:41:47;"much different than mine when he was 45,"
01:41:47;01:41:49;"because he had this entire--"
01:41:49;01:41:54;"I mean, he was still having to reckon with his younger"
01:41:54;01:41:56;"self at that point."
01:41:56;01:41:59;"I mean, I feel like he's gotten beyond that now."
01:41:59;01:42:00;"Certainly people who love Bob Dylan,"
01:42:00;01:42:05;"they're not comparing him to who he was when he was 25."
01:42:05;01:42:08;"But when he was making records in the '80s,"
01:42:08;01:42:11;"that was still something he had to react against."
01:42:11;01:42:14;"And it just made those records sound worse,"
01:42:14;01:42:16;"I think, to people at the time."
01:42:16;01:42:18;"Whereas we can listen to those records now,"
01:42:18;01:42:21;"and we have the benefit of just appreciating it"
01:42:21;01:42:25;"as part of an unfolding story."
01:42:25;01:42:28;"We're not comparing it to what he was in the '60s."
01:42:28;01:42:30;"We can just kind of appreciate, oh, this"
01:42:30;01:42:34;"is like the flavor of Bob in the '80s."
01:42:34;01:42:36;"But I got to say, to go back to Van Morrison,"
01:42:36;01:42:38;"Van Morrison is like--"
01:42:38;01:42:40;"I feel like his legacy is in flux,"
01:42:40;01:42:42;"just because he's a lunatic."
01:42:42;01:42:47;"And he's said a lot of stupid things in recent years."
01:42:47;01:42:50;"His '80s period, I think, is the best '80s period"
01:42:50;01:42:54;"of all the '60s singer-songwriters."
01:42:54;01:42:55;"Whoa."
01:42:55;01:42:58;"Compare him-- and I love '80s Bob."
01:42:58;01:43:02;"But I think '80s Van, that might be my favorite decade for Van."
01:43:02;01:43:07;"What's your number one song from '80s Van?"
01:43:07;01:43:10;"Man, ""Cleaning Windows"" is a great song."
01:43:10;01:43:12;"All right, I'm going to start there."
01:43:12;01:43:13;"Common One."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"Common One is great."
01:43:14;01:43:16;"""Summertime in England."""
01:43:16;01:43:20;"""Summertime in England,"" probably, from Common One"
01:43:20;01:43:21;"is a great song."
01:43:21;01:43:24;"I love the song ""Beautiful Vision."""
01:43:24;01:43:26;"Yeah, like the song ""Beautiful Vision,"""
01:43:26;01:43:28;"the song ""Dweller on the Threshold."""
01:43:28;01:43:29;"I was going to say, ""Dweller on the Threshold,"""
01:43:29;01:43:31;"that's a great song, too."
01:43:31;01:43:34;"That album with the Chieftains he did is really beautiful."
01:43:34;01:43:36;"Oh, yeah, actually, I know that one."
01:43:36;01:43:38;"And I've always loved that, because I've always loved"
01:43:38;01:43:40;"that kind of traditional Irish stuff."
01:43:40;01:43:41;"Actually, I was going to say--"
01:43:41;01:43:43;"We've got to do an '80s Van episode soon."
01:43:43;01:43:44;"I was going to say--"
01:43:44;01:43:45;"I was going to have you say--"
01:43:45;01:43:47;"I was going to say ""In the Garden,"" actually,"
01:43:47;01:43:49;"from ""No Guru, No Method, No Teacher,"""
01:43:49;01:43:51;"which is one of my favorite Van records."
01:43:51;01:43:53;"""In the Garden,"" beautiful song."
01:43:53;01:43:55;"OK, all right, I'm starting with ""In the Garden."""
01:43:55;01:44:00;"Stephen's making the Time Crisis number one live event"
01:44:00;01:44:01;"flows."
01:44:01;01:44:02;"All right, you got to--"
01:44:02;01:44:05;"and an '80s Van Morrison."
01:44:05;01:44:09;"Well, we decided on 25 event flows for Jake, right?"
01:44:09;01:44:10;"We'll share them with the audience."
01:44:10;01:44:11;"Top 25 event flows."
01:44:11;01:44:13;"And then with the Van thing, you need to imagine that it's"
01:44:13;01:44:18;"1994, and Van Morrison is making his ""Greatest Hits"""
01:44:18;01:44:22;"volume three at the time, a la Bob."
01:44:22;01:44:24;"And he has to dig into that material,"
01:44:24;01:44:27;"and he has to tell his own idiosyncratic story of what"
01:44:27;01:44:28;"he's been up to."
01:44:28;01:44:31;"And he did have some actual pretty big songs, at least"
01:44:31;01:44:32;"in the late '80s, right?"
01:44:32;01:44:34;"There's that song, ""Have I Told You Lately,"""
01:44:34;01:44:36;"that Rod Stewart covered."
01:44:36;01:44:37;"That became a--"
01:44:37;01:44:38;"Right, so that became like a--"
01:44:38;01:44:40;"yeah, that became almost like a standard."

01:45:12;01:45:19;"Yeah, we watched the petals fall down to the ground."

01:47:55;01:47:59;"Chili Peppers ranking their albums."
01:47:59;01:48:00;"Did you get deep into the--"

01:48:08;01:48:10;"It didn't make a huge impression on me."
01:48:10;01:48:15;"But I'll admit that I was excited to hear a Chili"
01:48:15;01:48:17;"Peppers record that John Frusciante plays on,"
01:48:17;01:48:21;"because I do like him a lot as a guitar player."
01:48:21;01:48:23;"It was interesting doing that list,"
01:48:23;01:48:25;"because the thing I realized is that people's"
01:48:25;01:48:28;"favorite Chili Peppers albums are"
01:48:28;01:48:30;"the ones that came out between--"
01:48:30;01:48:33;"whatever albums came up between the ages of 12 and 17,"
01:48:33;01:48:36;"for whatever reader it was, those were the favorites."

01:49:30;01:49:31;"Colin, another producer on the show,"
01:49:31;01:49:33;"emailed us about this song a while ago."
01:49:33;01:49:34;"I guess it's doing pretty well."

01:50:46;01:50:47;"Are you in Japan too, Steven?"
01:50:47;01:50:50;"[laughs]"
01:50:50;01:50:52;"I had another interview before this."
01:50:52;01:50:53;"Wow."
01:50:53;01:50:53;"Sucks."
01:50:53;01:50:54;"Wow."
01:50:54;01:50:56;"Coffee at home at 9 at night."
01:50:56;01:50:57;"I know."
01:50:57;01:50:59;"I might be paying for it later."
01:50:59;01:50:59;"Hopefully not so much."
01:50:59;01:51:01;"Some people can just do it."
01:51:01;01:51:02;"That sucks."
01:51:02;01:51:05;"This is honestly-- ""Life's Been Good"""
01:51:05;01:51:07;"is like one of my favorite songs of all time."
01:51:07;01:51:10;"I think the lyrics of this song are brilliant."
01:51:10;01:51:12;"Like, every lyric is very quotable."
01:51:12;01:51:13;"It's a great song."
01:51:13;01:51:17;"And this cover of it just makes me--"
01:51:17;01:51:18;"it makes my heart hurt a little bit."
01:51:18;01:51:19;"[music - ""life's been good""]"
01:51:19;01:51:21;"(SINGING) Should've complained, but sometimes I"
01:51:21;01:51:23;"do 'cause it comes with the fame."
01:51:23;01:51:25;"They say I'm crazy, but I have to be."
01:51:25;01:51:27;"Because I feel like the Joe Walsh version"
01:51:27;01:51:31;"has like a layer of irony to it that makes it really work."
01:51:31;01:51:32;"Of course."
01:51:32;01:51:33;"There's no irony here at all."
01:51:33;01:51:36;"It just feels like it's total bro rock."
01:51:36;01:51:38;"It's Tony Soprano's ""A Cool Guy."""
01:51:38;01:51:41;"[laughter]"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"Although the one thing--"
01:51:42;01:51:45;"""Life's Been Good"" is mostly a reggae song."
01:51:45;01:51:46;"Yeah."
01:51:46;01:51:49;"Musically, it's like not a stretch at all."
01:51:49;01:51:50;"What is this band?"
01:51:50;01:51:51;"OK, but I didn't-- yeah."
01:51:51;01:51:54;"They're rapping about-- OK, all right, let's move on."
01:51:54;01:51:57;"I'd love to go deeper on ""Dirty Heads,"" but yeah,"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"starting with a cover of a beloved song"
01:51:59;01:52:01;"is always going to be a tough way."
01:52:01;01:52:04;"It just makes you wonder, what is the alternative audience"
01:52:04;01:52:05;"in 2022?"
01:52:05;01:52:07;"Because you talk about alternative was always"
01:52:07;01:52:09;"like a weird term in the '90s, but you"
01:52:09;01:52:12;"felt like there was some unifying aesthetic that"
01:52:12;01:52:14;"defined what it was."
01:52:14;01:52:16;"And I don't know what this aesthetic is."
01:52:16;01:52:17;"Now it's truly bizarre."
01:52:17;01:52:20;"And I mean, it's only going to get more bizarre"
01:52:20;01:52:24;"with number two, ""Imagine Dragons,"" ""Bones."""
01:52:24;01:52:28;"I mean, I do understand how they're alternative,"
01:52:28;01:52:31;"but they also are, in a sense, one of the biggest pop artists"
01:52:31;01:52:34;"of the past 5, 10 years."
01:52:34;01:52:35;"Let's see what this one sounds like."
01:52:35;01:52:37;"Is this new?"
01:52:37;01:52:40;"Steve, are you an ""Imagine Dragons"" defender?"
01:52:40;01:52:41;"I'm not a defender, necessarily."
01:52:41;01:52:46;"I was just going to shout out a old school ""Time Crisis"""
01:52:46;01:52:47;"episode."
01:52:47;01:52:49;"I think that's like one of the great episodes in the catalog,"
01:52:50;01:52:54;"where you talk about ""Imagine Dragons"" in the 1975."
01:52:54;01:52:55;"Oh, right."
01:52:55;01:52:57;"The singer from 1975 was hating on them."
01:52:57;01:53:00;"Yeah, that's a great riff."
01:53:00;01:53:01;"I love that episode."
01:53:01;01:53:02;"[music - ""time crisis""]"
01:53:02;01:53:03;"(SINGING) Patience is waning."
01:53:03;01:53:05;"Is this entertaining?"
01:53:05;01:53:07;"Ah-ee, ah-ee, ah."
01:53:07;01:53:10;"I'm not a defender, but I'm not a hater of ""Imagine Dragons."""
01:53:10;01:53:12;"I understand why they're popular,"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"where they fit in the world."
01:53:14;01:53:17;"And Dan Reynolds, lead singer, seems"
01:53:18;01:53:21;"like he's a legitimately positive guy."
01:53:21;01:53:22;"Like a genuine dude."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"Yeah, like a positive good force."
01:53:24;01:53:25;"And there's something, too, where it's like--"
01:53:25;01:53:26;"you know, I can understand."
01:53:26;01:53:29;"There's this kind of mix of rock,"
01:53:29;01:53:33;"and this type of pop production is not for everybody."
01:53:33;01:53:36;"I do think, though, if you could take a step back,"
01:53:36;01:53:39;"you could just tell that ""Imagine Dragons"" are doing it"
01:53:39;01:53:40;"right."
01:53:40;01:53:41;"You know, you might not like it."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"I've just always had that vibe off them."
01:53:43;01:53:44;"It's like, they're doing it right."
01:53:44;01:53:47;"They seem like a likely candidate for a band"
01:53:47;01:53:50;"that, in 10 or 20 years, somebody with no baggage"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"could go back and, like, you know,"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"shock their aging hipster parents"
01:53:54;01:53:56;"by finding inspiration in."
01:53:56;01:54:01;"Yeah, and if you're at an NBA game, and it's a timeout,"
01:54:01;01:54:03;"and ""Radioactive"" comes on, you're"
01:54:03;01:54:04;"going to probably enjoy it."
01:54:04;01:54:07;"You know, it's like a good song for that environment."
01:54:07;01:54:10;"It's jock jams type music."
01:54:10;01:54:12;"And they have a lot of them."
01:54:12;01:54:13;"Exactly."
01:54:13;01:54:17;"Where if I'm just hanging out in my office,"
01:54:17;01:54:18;"I'm not going to put it on."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"But if it comes on in the right environment,"
01:54:20;01:54:21;"I'm not going to hate it."
01:54:21;01:54:22;"Right."
01:54:22;01:54:23;"Yeah, that's a good point."
01:54:23;01:54:26;"I'm psyched in 20 years when our kids start a band,"
01:54:26;01:54:29;"and the major touchstone is ""Imagine Dragons."""
01:54:29;01:54:30;"Well, you know, I will say--"
01:54:30;01:54:31;"Come on, guys."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"--one of the things that made me--"
01:54:32;01:54:33;"Come on, guys."
01:54:33;01:54:34;"No GBV?"
01:54:34;01:54:35;"--one of the things that made me appreciate ""Radioactive"""
01:54:35;01:54:38;"is that years ago, I was in my hometown,"
01:54:38;01:54:42;"and we were at this, like, church picnic."
01:54:42;01:54:45;"And there was a teenage band on stage,"
01:54:45;01:54:47;"and they played ""Radioactive."""
01:54:47;01:54:48;"And it was very charming."
01:54:48;01:54:50;"That was probably one of the first songs"
01:54:50;01:54:51;"they ever learned to play."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"And I was like, OK."
01:54:52;01:54:54;"I actually kind of like this song now,"
01:54:54;01:54:55;"because I saw 14-year-olds playing it."
01:54:55;01:54:56;"I can see that sounding great, just"
01:54:56;01:54:58;"like kind of a garage band."
01:54:58;01:55:00;"(SINGING) Radioactive."
01:55:00;01:55:04;"And they had this, like, teenage girl lead singer,"
01:55:04;01:55:06;"and she was singing it kind of off key."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"But it was great."
01:55:07;01:55:11;"It was like the best possible version of that song."
01:55:11;01:55:11;"So-- - Love it."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"--yeah."
01:55:12;01:55:13;"Yeah, exactly."
01:55:13;01:55:15;"There's definitely something to it."
01:55:15;01:55:16;"OK, and then the number one, I guess,"
01:55:16;01:55:19;"in a way, the number one song is by The Killers."
01:55:19;01:55:21;"It's a new song called ""Boy."""
01:55:21;01:55:24;"We've had ""Imagine Dragons,"" ""Dirty Heads,"" ""Red Hot Chili"
01:55:24;01:55:27;"Peppers,"" and ""Vance Joy."""
01:55:27;01:55:29;"I mean, in a way, The Killers are the most, like,"
01:55:29;01:55:32;"classically modern alternative band."
01:55:32;01:55:33;"Because even-- I mean, of course,"
01:55:33;01:55:34;"""Red Hot Chili Peppers"" are alternative,"
01:55:34;01:55:36;"but, you know, that's their funky side."
01:55:36;01:55:38;"That's kind of its own thing."
01:55:38;01:55:40;"I'm curious what this song sounds like."
01:55:40;01:55:42;"Steven, you've been writing for kind of, like,"
01:55:42;01:55:44;"late period killers, right?"
01:55:44;01:55:45;"You're a ""Pressure Machine"" fan?"
01:55:45;01:55:48;"""Pressure Machine,"" ""Imploding the Mirage,"""
01:55:48;01:55:49;"I think, especially the singles--"
01:55:49;01:55:50;"Oh, yeah, ""Imploding the Mirage."""
01:55:50;01:55:51;"That was strong. Yeah."
01:55:51;01:55:53;"There's some good songs from there."
01:55:53;01:55:58;"And, yeah, I think they've had, like, a pretty good late career"
01:55:58;01:55:59;"resurgence."
01:56:00;01:56:02;"Ooh, this is getting back into some of that kind"
01:56:02;01:56:04;"of dance music killers."
01:56:04;01:56:05;"Oh, yeah."
01:56:08;01:56:13;"I feel like this is going to explode at some point."
01:56:16;01:56:30;"I mean, I like this mode of the killers,"
01:56:30;01:56:34;"but we can officially say in the five alternative songs"
01:56:34;01:56:38;"we've heard so far, none of them are really doing a rock thing."
01:56:38;01:56:41;"You can make a case of doing an alternative type of thing."
01:56:41;01:56:41;"We've heard reggae."
01:56:41;01:56:43;"We've heard funk."
01:56:43;01:56:44;"We've heard pop."
01:56:44;01:56:45;"We've heard dance music."
01:56:45;01:56:46;"Very little rock."
01:56:46;01:56:48;"Yeah, this is like--"
01:56:48;01:56:50;"This is kind of '80s, like, you know,"
01:56:50;01:56:51;"""New Order"" or some [bleep]"
01:56:51;01:56:55;"No, totally, but it's not guitar-based rock or whatever."
01:56:55;01:56:56;"Right, right."
01:56:56;01:56:58;"Yeah, it's like, yeah, like that ""New Order"""
01:56:58;01:57:02;"thing with, like, a little bit of, like, a Joshua Tree"
01:57:02;01:57:04;"sense of uplift to it."
01:57:06;01:57:09;"(SINGING) There is a place that exists."
01:57:09;01:57:11;"Just give it some time."
01:57:11;01:57:13;"I like this song."
01:57:13;01:57:14;"I like this song."
01:57:14;01:57:15;"Yeah."
01:57:15;01:57:17;"I wonder what that hot sauce is doing."
01:57:17;01:57:18;"Oh, yeah."
01:57:18;01:57:19;"I wonder if it's still in production,"
01:57:19;01:57:21;"or if that was kind of like a one-off thing."
01:57:21;01:57:22;"We had two members of the killers"
01:57:22;01:57:26;"call in a couple of years ago because they were promoting"
01:57:26;01:57:30;"a hot sauce that they made, a four-pack, which actually,"
01:57:30;01:57:31;"I went through all of it."
01:57:31;01:57:34;"I enjoyed-- I eventually used all four"
01:57:34;01:57:38;"bottles of the hot sauce on various homemade breakfast"
01:57:38;01:57:39;"burritos."
01:57:39;01:57:40;"Yeah, it was great."
01:57:40;01:57:41;"It was good."
01:57:41;01:57:42;"We didn't talk music with them."
01:57:42;01:57:43;"Hardly at all."
01:57:43;01:57:44;"Just hot sauce."
01:57:44;01:57:45;"Mostly hot sauce, yeah."
01:57:45;01:57:48;"I recently went to Utah for the first time."
01:57:48;01:57:49;"And--"
01:57:49;01:57:51;"Great state."
01:57:51;01:57:54;"Yeah, and I think it deepened my appreciation"
01:57:54;01:57:56;"of Brandon Flowers."
01:57:56;01:57:57;"He still lives--"
01:57:57;01:57:59;"I think he's moved back there."
01:57:59;01:58:00;"And it's such a--"
01:58:00;01:58:02;"Oh, yeah, I'm pretty sure he's a Utah resident."
01:58:02;01:58:03;"What town is he in?"
01:58:03;01:58:06;"He's, like, in some small town."
01:58:06;01:58:07;"He's not in Salt Lake City."
01:58:07;01:58:09;"I think he's out in the mountains."
01:58:09;01:58:12;"Because it's such an unlikely place for him"
01:58:12;01:58:17;"to live as one of the reigning rock frontmen of the time."
01:58:17;01:58:20;"I also got to point out that the Killers and Imagine Dragons"
01:58:20;01:58:23;"are number one and number two bands."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"They both have origins in Las Vegas."
01:58:25;01:58:29;"They both have origins in the Mormon church."
01:58:29;01:58:31;"They probably might have different relationships"
01:58:31;01:58:34;"with the religion they were raised in."
01:58:34;01:58:36;"And I think, actually, Brandon's brother"
01:58:37;01:58:39;"is Imagine Dragons' manager or something."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"So it's like a real--"
01:58:40;01:58:43;"it's like a very close connection."
01:58:43;01:58:46;"Shout out to Nevada and Utah for shaping the sound"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"of modern alternative music."
01:58:48;01:58:50;"All right, guys, thank you so much,"
01:58:50;01:58:52;"Steven, for coming through."
01:58:52;01:58:55;"Check out the book in stores now."
01:58:55;01:58:58;"Check out the Killers hot sauce."
01:58:58;01:59:00;"Make sure you call."
01:59:00;01:59:01;"Call your close friends and loved ones,"
01:59:01;01:59:04;"because it's really important that sometime"
01:59:04;01:59:06;"in the next, let's say, two weeks, you do a dirt night."
01:59:06;01:59:07;"All right, bye, everybody."
01:59:07;01:59:09;"Bye, Steven."
01:59:09;01:59:13;"Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
01:59:13;01:59:14;"- Great."
