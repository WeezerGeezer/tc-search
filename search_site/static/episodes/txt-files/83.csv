00:00;00:10;"Time Crisis. 2018 comes to a close. A shadow is cast over the land. On this week's episode,"
00:10;00:15;"we invite Chris Bale to try the Target Hot Sauce Challenge. We also talk about Bruce"
00:15;00:26;"Springsteen, Mariah Carey Christmas songs, plus the top Billboard hits of 2018. All this,"
00:26;00:33;"plus the year in review. This is Time Crisis with Ezra King. B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Spoiler 1."
00:33;00:40;"They passed me by, all of those great romances."
00:40;00:47;"The world I felt, wobbly, all my rightful chances."
00:47;00:54;"My picture clear, everything seemed so easy."
00:54;00:59;"And so I dealt you the blow,"
00:59;01:06;"one of us had to go."
01:06;01:10;"Now it's different, I want you to know."
01:10;01:16;"One of us is crying, one of us is lying."
01:16;01:20;"Leave the lonely bare."
01:20;01:25;"Alright, let's just get right in. Yeah. We got Bale in the house. What's up, Bale?"
01:25;01:35;"What's up? Good to be back. So we've been talking for a while. A lot of people are trying this new challenge called the One Chip Challenge. You hear about this, Jake?"
01:35;01:47;"No. There's a company that makes a tortilla chip. Right. Or is it potato chip? I think it's a tortilla. A tortilla chip that's so spicy that they sell them one at a time and get this."
01:47;01:59;"Which company? The company's called Paqui. We're guessing at the pronunciation here. But this chip is so spicy that they sell it one at a time and it comes in a little cardboard coffin."
01:59;02:09;"Coffin? The implication being that you're going to die when you eat it. Now, that's so cool. At Time Crisis, you know, we're very timely. We love to participate in big trends."
02:09;02:19;"So, time for when did this One Chip Challenge really get popping? I want to say like a year and a half ago. Here's the thing, though. It was when I first came on Time Crisis a little over two years ago."
02:19;02:30;"We did like a snack food history, a personal history of mine. It was like 5, 10, 15, 20. We were talking about how I just I love spice. I like I go nuts for spicy stuff."
02:30;02:39;"And the One Chip Challenge, which was happening that time, came up. So it came up then, like over two years ago. Wow. That was two years ago?"
02:39;02:50;"That was October of 2016. Totally different world. When we were in rehearsal on Friday, I was talking about how like I haven't had a spicy enough chip in a long time."
02:50;03:03;"And as suggested that we do the One Chip Challenge on the Vampire Weekend Instagram when like things start kicking up in the new year that like we could participate in old viral challenges and stuff like that."
03:03;03:14;"So it was just a topic of conversation on Friday. And then on Sunday, I opened Instagram and I got a message from someone that shook me to my core. It was a guy named Big Dom Ryan."
03:14;03:24;"And what Big Dom Ryan sent me was he said, I'm sorry to call you out like this, but I'm a big fan and I can't let this stand against the Bayonne name any longer."
03:24;03:31;"It's high time you put your money where your mouth is and do the One Chip Challenge on Time Crisis. Peace out and big love."
03:31;03:41;"That's crazy. Wow. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I mean, we're talking about a dead meme here. Clearly, the universe wants us to resurrect the One Chip Challenge."
03:41;03:48;"I'm so confused. Okay. So they sell one chip. Oh, that's the part you're confused about."
03:48;03:53;"How is what does that retail for? That's a good question. Seinfeld. That's an actual number crunch."
03:53;04:01;"Like if you go to the AM, PM and you're like picking up that one chip, I'm guessing like 10 bucks for a chip on Amazon."
04:01;04:05;"When I looked at it, they were one hundred seventy five dollars now for a single chip."
04:05;04:11;"So it's more expensive than even a pretty high end wine. Yeah, this is very exclusive."
04:11;04:16;"It's like sneakers that get resold. So, yeah, they I'm seeing one for one fifty on Amazon."
04:16;04:26;"eBay's got one for forty five dollars. These prices are because the one chip challenge two years ago decimated the world supplies of the one chip."
04:26;04:33;"And honestly, it was great for this brand because with the one chip challenge, it's not like you can just go be pulling chips at willy nilly."
04:33;04:39;"You needed the one in the coffin. I saw Shaq do one. A lot of morning drive time radio hosted it."
04:39;04:49;"It's also I feel like it's probably having a lot on the radio, which is extra funny because you can just picture people being like, oh, oh, oh, my God, it's not."
04:49;04:53;"Wait, this is Meredith. This is how I did the one chip challenge. Everybody was doing it."
04:53;04:58;"So that's going to happen here today. Yeah, because it's time for us. We don't care about timelines."
04:58;05:05;"Oh, man, I mean, we're talking the next year we're going to get the vampire weekend Instagram poppin by doing the ice bucket challenge."
05:05;05:09;"That's so tight. We got to think who would be the perfect band."
05:09;05:16;"I was thinking Tame Impala would be good to challenge. Maybe it should be like an older band that broke up."
05:16;05:22;"Death Cab. I think they still play. Yeah. Postal service."
05:22;05:29;"Yeah, I mean, I think they're kind of one album and done. Hey, guys, vampire week in here. We're doing the ice bucket challenge."
05:29;05:32;"Oh, postal service, you're next."
05:33;05:36;"Someone please call the surgeon."
05:36;05:40;"Crack my ribs and repair this broken heart."
05:40;05:43;"That's your desert."
05:43;05:47;"The company."
05:47;05:50;"I can't accept that as."
05:50;05:53;"Walk the door like."
05:53;05:57;"Tending the net in the third quarter."
05:57;06:02;"The time."
06:02;06:05;"So just."
06:05;06:10;"Make it."
06:10;06:12;"I swear."
06:12;06:17;"To my best."
06:17;06:19;"Tell me."
06:19;06:21;"To think."
06:21;06:24;"Nothing."
06:24;06:31;"Making."
06:31;06:36;"But anyway, so Bayo texted me that screenshot of the DM. Really, this is crazy."
06:36;06:41;"Yeah, nobody's talking about the one chip challenge anymore. A lot of people turn their back on it."
06:41;06:45;"Yeah. So the next thing I hit the TC thread, guys, we need the one chip."
06:45;06:48;"Right. I saw that happening on the thread and I was like, what's going on?"
06:48;06:52;"I'm going to lay back in the cut. Let this happen."
06:52;06:54;"And I get text back. We got it."
06:54;07:00;"Local eBay seller who's about to send us one shout out to producer Matt."
07:00;07:05;"He was going to meet the seller at a parking lot in West Covina."
07:05;07:10;"And grab it. And then about 24 hours later, I don't know. Does anybody know the actual story?"
07:10;07:14;"This seller bailed this can wax seller bailed."
07:14;07:17;"They canceled on us. Last minute cancel. All right."
07:17;07:19;"What's up with that night before showtime?"
07:19;07:23;"Did they not have the product? Yeah, that's a great question."
07:23;07:28;"Anybody know? Do you know? I'm just going through the group text. You're seeing what he said."
07:28;07:31;"There's a lot. There's a lot of junk in here. I'm looking at the thread."
07:31;07:34;"He just says that out of nowhere, the seller canceled the eBay order."
07:34;07:37;"There you go. Why would they do that?"
07:37;07:41;"What possible reason is there to cancel a one chip eBay order?"
07:41;07:45;"Either he didn't have the product. He's just horsing around on eBay, which is a marketplace."
07:45;07:50;"eBay is not a website for horsing around. That's a weird way to horse around."
07:50;07:58;"So anyway, the time crisis donkey of the week is this jag off on eBay."
07:58;08:02;"But anyway, we said, you know what? That's not the only spicy thing in the world."
08:02;08:05;"Nope. And in fact, we were two years late on this challenge anyway."
08:05;08:07;"So I guess we're kind of starting our own challenge now."
08:07;08:12;"This one's called the Target hot sauce challenge."
08:12;08:15;"So I guess somebody was a producer, Matt."
08:15;08:20;"He found out that you can buy a target, something that's called the Target hot sauce challenge."
08:20;08:24;"It's a flight of hot sauces. Seinfeld, what's up with this?"
08:24;08:28;"What am I looking at here? It's a gift set."
08:28;08:34;"Retails for fifteen dollars at Target. Delish dot com. That's a fair price."
08:34;08:39;"Yeah. Listed it as. Oh, there's an article here about it. Let's see."
08:39;08:44;"Target's hot sauce challenge gift set bestows ten tiny bottles of hot sauce on spice lovers."
08:44;08:49;"I don't think it started organically. I think they just called it the challenge and then hopes that social media would catch on."
08:49;08:55;"You're saying they released a product that didn't have some sort of organic grounds behind it."
08:55;08:59;"You know, Target for their viral."
08:59;09:04;"When I think of Target, I think of like a brand new issue of like a Chicago shirt."
09:04;09:12;"Chicago, the band. Well, Target, there's only one radio show."
09:12;09:17;"This is below the caliber of even like morning drive time DJ material."
09:17;09:20;"Is this the most like shock jockey thing in history?"
09:20;09:25;"It was up there. I like it real quick."
09:25;09:32;"My mother in law, Linda, I think was Googling around to see if it was press about Hannah's movie, The Long Dumb Road."
09:32;09:37;"She sent Hannah an email that says I stumbled across the episode of Time Crisis that you were on."
09:37;09:43;"Why would anyone want to listen to Jake argue about what his band name should be called?"
09:43;09:47;"30 minutes into the email. That's cold."
09:47;09:51;"Yeah, it's a generational thing. I mean, it's hard to jump in cold on that."
09:51;09:56;"Yeah, very contextual. Maybe you should send her an email. Do you call her mom?"
09:56;10:03;"Absolutely not. That's a thing, though. Yeah. You call your mother in law mom bear?"
10:03;10:09;"No, not color. And yeah, just first name. I did call my father in law, Mr. Doyle, for like five years."
10:09;10:15;"Five years. Yeah, but I would. And then he was finally like once he sent me, I was like, please call me Jim."
10:15;10:21;"Five years. And then you have five years. OK, dad. He said I said Jim. Yeah, exactly. Not dad."
10:21;10:27;"What was up with the five years? I don't know. He just liked hearing it. Maybe he did like that respect I was giving him."
10:27;10:32;"He's got to make sure that you're going to stick around. Wow. You know? Yeah, I dig it. Very old school, though."
10:32;10:36;"Well, OK, but this is a thing that some people call their mother in law mom. Oh, I've heard it."
10:36;10:40;"So maybe you should start and just say, hey, mom, I don't think that would I don't think that would play."
10:40;10:47;"You dropped into Episode 77 of TC. I put together a great sets of episodes."
10:47;10:52;"One to 76. You can. Yeah, she's like vaguely aware of the show."
10:52;10:56;"I think the first time she heard it was us talking about dick pics versus Richard pictures."
10:56;11:02;"OK, 25 minutes. So on the thread, Nick was emailing to get some more info from Matt."
11:02;11:06;"First, he asked if he was going to give the eBay seller a bad review for bailing on us."
11:06;11:10;"Matt said I was going to, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I relate to that, actually."
11:10;11:14;"Yeah, because I Uber everywhere or I Uber quite a bit. Yeah."
11:14;11:18;"And you ever drop like a two hammer? Never."
11:18;11:21;"Honestly, I've dropped a two hammer before. Wow."
11:21;11:27;"Always like I was in one today. This stunk to high heaven. Wow. Cigarettes."
11:27;11:32;"I also think there's something Uber is a good metaphor for life because, you know,"
11:32;11:38;"sometimes you're sitting in the back of a car smelling cigarette smoke, watching this dude text,"
11:38;11:41;"miss exits all this. Your blood's boiling. Damn."
11:41;11:46;"And then you're like, I'm going to give this guy a two. Are you like, bro, watch the road?"
11:46;11:51;"In a really extreme circumstance. Yeah, I would. But then when I get out, I'm always kind of like,"
11:51;11:54;"I just forget about it. Then I go because usually I'm moving on."
11:54;11:57;"Yeah, because the thing about Uber, you only take Uber where you're going somewhere."
11:57;12:02;"You know what I'm saying? You get to that place. Now you're doing whatever you're supposed to do at the place."
12:02;12:05;"And then generally I forget about it until the next time I get an Uber."
12:05;12:08;"And it's like, how was your last ride? I'm like five stars. And here's a tip."
12:08;12:12;"Yep. It just kind of reminds you that, you know, all things must pass."
12:12;12:17;"There's a couple of times where I thought about like maybe at the end saying, hey, listen, I'm a nice guy."
12:17;12:24;"I'm giving you a five. But there might be some other people who might find that this clearly you were just smoking a few minutes ago."
12:24;12:27;"I had a guy the other morning who kept eating his bagel while we were driving."
12:27;12:30;"And I'm like, if you were starving, couldn't you just wait a few minutes?"
12:30;12:33;"But then another part of me is like, oh, it's such a hard job. I don't know."
12:33;12:38;"So sometimes I think like I say, hey, listen, I know how it is to be hungry on the job."
12:38;12:41;"I just want to say, I don't know how long you've been doing this."
12:41;12:46;"Maybe somebody else. That doesn't seem right because I can just totally picture that conversation getting where it's like, you know what?"
12:46;12:50;"You get out or be like nobody else has had a problem that I'm not saying I have a problem."
12:50;12:53;"They're just saying somebody might. Well, they can go fuck themselves, too."
12:53;12:58;"Why did the bagel bum you out? Just because he was driving with one hand while eating the bagel."
12:58;13:01;"And also, clearly, he didn't really know where we were going either."
13:01;13:06;"So it's like I kind of feel like looking at navigation is already one task."
13:06;13:09;"Yeah. So driving and looking at navigation, that's two tasks."
13:09;13:13;"I draw a line of three. Come on. Especially when I don't know you like that."
13:13;13:17;"Northside calling Shoddy at a smart state."
13:17;13:20;"Heard you was a lame boy. Get up on my face."
13:20;13:23;"And my ex keep calling sweater. She be in the way."
13:23;13:27;"And I need a day to wrap on Shoddy while late."
13:27;13:31;"Bad in LA. Tell me I should make the trip."
13:31;13:33;"Shoddy bet his head. Yeah. With him."
13:33;13:36;"Colleague general is over everywhere."
13:36;13:39;"Free rolls in my bill. Canada."
13:39;13:41;"Yeah, I think that from the city."
13:41;13:44;"So you want to kiss me, but I know she's sucking."
13:44;13:48;"So you want to kiss me, but I know she's sucking."
13:48;13:51;"Look over everywhere. Free rolls in the bill."
13:51;13:55;"Yeah. Over everywhere. Free rolls in my bill."
13:55;13:59;"Anyway, Matt was going to give this eBay seller a bad review."
13:59;14:02;"He couldn't bring himself to do it. And then Nick wrote, ha ha."
14:02;14:07;"Do you know why he bailed? And Matt said he said he lied about being in Los Angeles."
14:07;14:10;"And it wouldn't get to us in time."
14:10;14:13;"Wait, why would an eBay user lie about where they are?"
14:13;14:16;"Isn't that just like asking for trouble? Seems like it to me."
14:16;14:18;"Well, so how much was it listed for?"
14:18;14:24;"Maybe they were like he was just like doing whatever it took to unload the one chip at the price that the seller was looking for."
14:24;14:27;"And I was like, oh, you know, I don't know in his or her mind."
14:27;14:31;"It's like, oh, I don't know if this is like time sensitive. Oh, yeah, I'm totally in LA."
14:31;14:34;"Whatever. Whatever. Right. And then someone's like, oh, well, we need it for Tuesday."
14:34;14:36;"And the guy's like, oh, actually, I'm not in LA."
14:36;14:40;"I love this like this. I mean, like I sold it."
14:40;14:43;"Wait, the buyer needs it within 24 hours."
14:43;14:46;"Well, maybe they were just weirder. Right."
14:46;14:54;"Maybe someone is dropping like $160 at a tortilla chip that they need tomorrow."
14:54;14:58;"Presumably they must have reached out to him before they bought and said, listen, we need this soon."
14:58;15:00;"Can you do it? Where are you based? We're here in LA."
15:00;15:02;"And maybe the guy said, oh, yeah, I'm in LA."
15:02;15:06;"And they're like, cool. And then this guy's out there in Salt Lake City hyping himself up."
15:06;15:09;"Just be like, OK, we're doing a road trip. We're going to make 160 bucks."
15:09;15:15;"Let's do this. And then the next day, you know, some reality sets."
15:15;15:19;"Yeah. And he's like, I don't know why I lied, man."
15:19;15:24;"I live in Salt Lake City. I guess I just always I just always want a road trip down to L.A."
15:24;15:26;"But I forgot I had work. It's as simple as that."
15:26;15:29;"I guess I could have overnighted the tortilla chip."
15:29;15:34;"Yeah, that's true. We would have gladly paid."
15:34;15:36;"All right. I'm not mad at this guy anymore."
15:36;15:43;"You just kind of a nice guy out in Salt Lake City who got it in a little bit over his head."
15:43;15:47;"So anyway, forget the one chip challenge. We got the target."
15:47;15:52;"Oh, yeah. Hot sauce challenge. I guess I'll just get started with the hot sauce challenge."
15:52;15:58;"So we're going to kick it up a notch, though, by doing the hot sauces on the Pecky haunted ghost pepper."
15:58;16:03;"Right. Because Pecky does have one product that's sold at a lot of supermarkets, at least in L.A."
16:03;16:06;"How hot are these? Just I would imagine there."
16:06;16:11;"I mean, I'm going to try. I'm going to try a haunted ghost pepper, because this is what Bay is going to be putting the hot sauce on."
16:11;16:18;"So me and Jake are testing the baseline spiciness of the Pecky haunted ghost pepper."
16:18;16:24;"Watch out, Jake. It might sneak up on you. Jake's shaking his head like, what's the big deal?"
16:24;16:28;"It's not not hot. Oh, yeah, I'm going to need a beer."
16:28;16:32;"Can someone give me a beer thing? It's not not hot."
16:32;16:35;"It does sneak up on you, but it's I would say it's pretty low key."
16:35;16:37;"OK. Out of the gate, real mellow."
16:37;16:41;"Hotter than a flaming hot Cheeto."
16:42;16:46;"Make me want to live again."
16:46;16:54;"Make me want to live again."
16:54;16:58;"When you wake me in the morning."
16:58;17:02;"That is my favorite thing."
17:02;17:05;"It's so warm."
17:06;17:11;"And as it strikes a chord upon my skin."
17:11;17:18;"Now you see the evening with a voice that's bouncing like a spring."
17:18;17:22;"Heart is not for breaking."
17:22;17:27;"It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin."
17:27;17:34;"It's for beating out all the life it needs to begin."
17:34;17:37;"I do it."
17:37;17:41;"Make me want to live again."
17:41;17:43;"I do it."
17:43;17:46;"You make me want to live again."
17:46;17:49;"Make me want to live again."
17:49;17:51;"I do it."
17:51;17:56;"Make me want to live again."
17:56;17:58;"I do it."
18:01;18:04;"Make me want to live again."
18:04;18:06;"So we're starting at a spicy level."
18:06;18:09;"So Bill's going to be putting the hot sauces starting with number six."
18:09;18:10;"Number six."
18:10;18:13;"How many shakes of hot sauce per chip?"
18:13;18:14;"Well, shake."
18:14;18:16;"How many drops are we thinking?"
18:16;18:17;"Let's standardize."
18:17;18:18;"Three."
18:19;18:20;"OK."
18:20;18:21;"So the first one."
18:21;18:22;"That's a lot."
18:22;18:23;"Has two peppers."
18:23;18:25;"It's called the fiery original."
18:25;18:29;"Merry Christmas, everyone."
18:29;18:30;"It's OK."
18:30;18:31;"He's just burning through."
18:31;18:32;"OK."
18:32;18:33;"You're on to number --"
18:33;18:34;"It's got to --"
18:34;18:35;"So that was number six."
18:35;18:36;"You're on number seven."
18:36;18:37;"Number seven."
18:37;18:38;"All right."
18:38;18:39;"That's a pretty big --"
18:39;18:40;"These are healthy servings."
18:40;18:41;"Cayenne pepper."
18:41;18:44;"You can post some pictures so that the folks listening at home can really just see --"
18:44;18:46;"See what this is all about."
18:46;18:47;"Yeah."
18:47;18:50;"These are serious, serious dumps."
18:50;18:52;"So are you breaking a sweat right now?"
18:52;18:53;"No."
18:53;18:55;"I mean, I feel like I might sweat a little bit by the end of this."
18:55;18:58;"I'm feeling a little bit in like kind of my mustache area."
18:58;18:59;"Is your mouth numb?"
18:59;19:00;"No."
19:00;19:01;"Your mustache area."
19:01;19:03;"I'm feeling the perspiration starting in my mustache area."
19:03;19:06;"Because I'll be honest, I just had that one chip, sand sauce."
19:06;19:09;"I got a slight perspiration happening."
19:09;19:10;"Really?"
19:10;19:11;"I got a little bit of --"
19:11;19:12;"OK."
19:12;19:13;"This is a little --"
19:13;19:14;"OK."
19:14;19:15;"Now at number eight, you're finally starting to feel it."
19:15;19:16;"I'm feeling a little bit."
19:16;19:18;"I'd also like to add I haven't had a sip of water yet."
19:18;19:19;"Oh, that's true."
19:19;19:20;"Maybe that's --"
19:20;19:21;"Maybe go there."
19:21;19:22;"Maybe that's part of the challenge."
19:22;19:25;"So what's your regular like culinary situation?"
19:25;19:26;"Dietary situation?"
19:26;19:28;"Are you just going hard sriracha on everything?"
19:28;19:30;"Yeah, I go hard almost every meal."
19:30;19:32;"Is your wife just like, ""Yo, can you chill out""?"
19:32;19:33;"It's an issue in my household."
19:33;19:34;"I bet."
19:34;19:41;"Because she'll cook and sometimes like the dish will not be like intended to be a hot sauce dish."
19:41;19:44;"And I'll ask -- this is something I ask basically every time my wife cooks."
19:44;19:47;"What's the hot sauce policy on dinner tonight?"
19:47;19:50;"You mean because she'll be offended if you put on your own hot sauce?"
19:50;19:51;"Yeah."
19:51;19:52;"You got to try it."
19:52;19:56;"It's like, you know, the great like sushi masters, you're not like supposed to doctor."
19:56;19:57;"Right, no soy sauce."
19:57;20:02;"It's like disrespectful to the chef in a way if you just -- you know, and I want to nuke everything I eat."
20:02;20:03;"Right."
20:03;20:07;"So she worked really hard, nice dinner, different courses, candles,"
20:07;20:10;"and then you bust out ten bottles of the Target hot sauce challenge."
20:10;20:12;"She's like, ""Babe, you're killing the vibe, man."""
20:12;20:13;"Yeah, that is."
20:13;20:14;"That's definitely it."

21:38;21:38;"I'm feeling the tingles now."
21:38;21:39;"- But you like it."
21:39;21:40;"- I love it."
21:40;21:41;"- Okay."
21:41;21:43;"- I love, this is so fun."
21:43;21:44;"- Now you're on number nine."
21:44;21:47;"- Mango flavored habanero."
21:47;21:48;"- Habanero's no joke, folks."
21:48;21:50;"- I like, that's actually my, that's my."
21:50;21:55;"That's my pepper of choice, definitely."
21:55;21:58;"- And in 2018 with a bang."
21:58;22:00;"- Ooh, that's really nice."
22:00;22:01;"- Can you taste the mango?"
22:01;22:02;"- Yeah."
22:02;22:04;"- So this one's sweet and punishing."
22:04;22:06;"- That's really nice."
22:06;22:07;"- Number nine on the scale."
22:07;22:10;"- And then the final one is Cajun habanero."
22:10;22:11;"- This guy's maxing out."
22:11;22:12;"Number 10."
22:14;22:15;"- I love that."
22:15;22:16;"- Loves it."
22:16;22:17;"- This is really good."
22:17;22:18;"- Cajun habanero."
22:18;22:20;"- All right, now I'm sweating a little bit."
22:20;22:21;"- You wouldn't say anything about this experience"
22:21;22:23;"has been unpleasant."
22:23;22:24;"- This is incredible."
22:24;22:25;"- That tastes good."
22:25;22:26;"- I love it."
22:26;22:28;"- I honestly think if I ate five of those chips"
22:28;22:30;"consecutively, let alone with hot sauce,"
22:30;22:32;"I'd be a little bit like, I need a minute."
22:32;22:33;"- Oh, for sure."
22:33;22:34;"- And the hot, spicy."
22:34;22:35;"- I wanna try the mango one."
22:35;22:36;"I got a little pizza crust."
22:36;22:39;"- Okay, oh, Jake's ready to try number nine?"
22:39;22:40;"- I have some pizza crust here."
22:40;22:42;"I'm just gonna, that's a classic move, right?"
22:42;22:44;"The hot sauce and the pizza crust."
22:44;22:45;"- I put hot sauce on pizza all the time."
22:45;22:47;"- On the slice itself or just the crust?"
22:47;22:50;"- Both, everything, man."
22:50;22:53;"I just wanna say, this is all going out to Big Dom Ryan."
22:53;22:55;"I looked at his four photos on Instagram."
22:55;22:57;"I think he's a student at Oxford."
22:57;22:58;"He seems really cool."
22:58;22:59;"- So you just took down number nine?"
22:59;23:00;"No big deal?"
23:00;23:02;"- Great."
23:02;23:06;"- Maybe the target hot sauce challenge is not hot enough."
23:06;23:07;"- It could be hotter."
23:07;23:09;"- How come when people sometimes talk about"
23:09;23:13;"if somebody likes spicy food,"
23:13;23:15;"there's like a thing that people say where they go,"
23:15;23:17;"do you like spicy?"
23:17;23:18;"Oh, I love spicy."
23:18;23:19;"Do you like spicy?"
23:19;23:22;"Oh yeah, I like spicy."
23:22;23:24;"You know what I'm talking about?"
23:24;23:24;"- I do."
23:24;23:25;"- You guys, you know, that's the thing."
23:25;23:27;"There's like a type of person."
23:27;23:29;"Basically, spicy's an adjective, right?"
23:29;23:30;"- Yeah."
23:30;23:31;"- If you have a sweet tooth,"
23:31;23:32;"and then we say, you like sweet?"
23:32;23:34;"Yeah, I love sweet."
23:34;23:36;"It's instead of saying, do you like spicy food?"
23:36;23:37;"- It treats it like a noun in a weird way."
23:37;23:39;"Like it treats spicy like a noun."
23:39;23:40;"It's a weird thing."
23:40;23:42;"- Instead of saying, do you like spicy food?"
23:42;23:43;"Do you like spiciness?"
23:43;23:44;"- Oh, right, right, right."
23:44;23:46;"- You like spicy?"
23:46;23:48;"- Oh yeah, I love spicy."
23:48;23:49;"- I feel like it'd be like,"
23:49;23:52;"you're over at your boss's for a barbecue."
23:52;23:53;"Hey Jake, come over here."
23:53;23:55;"Hey Jake, you like spicy?"
23:55;23:56;"I'm making my own--"
23:56;23:57;"- I like spicy Thai food."
23:57;23:59;"(laughing)"
23:59;24:01;"- Hey Jake, you like spicy?"
24:01;24:04;"- Not generally a fan of spicy Italian sausage."
24:04;24:06;"I do like a spicy Thai, like I mentioned."
24:06;24:09;"- Yeah, it's also funny that it like transcends"
24:09;24:10;"types of food. - It's of all kinds."
24:10;24:12;"- Yes sir, I love spicy."
24:12;24:14;"Well try these wings, I don't like wings."
24:14;24:15;"- I'm a vegetarian."
24:16;24:17;"(laughing)"
24:17;24:18;"Actually, that'd be a cool combo,"
24:18;24:21;"is to be a spice head who's vegetarian."
24:21;24:22;"I feel like we've talked on this show before,"
24:22;24:24;"probably last time Bayo was here,"
24:24;24:28;"about how hot sauce has always been marketed"
24:28;24:31;"in this kind of like toxic masculinity way."
24:31;24:33;"There's something about hot sauce that goes along"
24:33;24:36;"with like grilling meat and like steak houses and stuff."
24:36;24:37;"It's like--"
24:37;24:38;"- Beer."
24:38;24:41;"- Yeah, and it's like this kind of like, it's bro-y."
24:41;24:42;"Again, I'm not talking about reality,"
24:42;24:44;"but it's definitely marketed in a way that's like,"
24:44;24:47;"it's for guys, I like spicy."
24:47;24:50;"And being vegetarian in our sick culture"
24:50;24:53;"is kind of considered like, well you don't eat steak?"
24:53;24:55;"You're telling me that you see a big fat steak,"
24:55;24:56;"you're not gonna eat the steak?"
24:56;24:58;"So anyway, I think it'd be kind of tight"
24:58;25:00;"to be a vegan spice head."
25:00;25:00;"- I feel that."
25:00;25:02;"- I think it could be a gripping novel."
25:02;25:05;"Maybe an HBO mini series."
25:05;25:06;"(laughing)"
25:06;25:07;"- Vegan spice head."
25:07;25:08;"- A vegan who likes spicy."
25:08;25:09;"(laughing)"
25:09;25:11;"Maybe it starts with like a missed connection"
25:11;25:14;"on the internet, somebody posts something."
25:14;25:15;"I overheard you on the subway--"
25:15;25:19;"- Timothee Chalamet in vegan spice head."
25:19;25:21;"- Vegan spice head."
25:21;25:22;"- I would watch that."
25:22;25:24;"- Timothee Chalamet is a vegan who goes to like,"
25:24;25:26;"I don't know, are there like spicy conferences?"
25:26;25:28;"There must be like hot sauce contests and stuff."
25:28;25:30;"- Well it could be kind of like a eat, pray, love thing"
25:30;25:32;"where they go to Thailand."
25:32;25:34;"- Oh, all like the Meccas of spice?"
25:34;25:35;"- Yeah, yeah."
25:35;25:35;"- That'd be tight."
25:35;25:36;"- Yeah, it'd be a little bit like,"
25:36;25:38;"remember that movie Bloodsport?"
25:38;25:39;"- Van Damme?"
25:39;25:40;"- From the 80s, yeah, with Van Damme."
25:40;25:41;"- Sure, sure."
25:41;25:42;"- Where it's all like the dudes who go to somewhere"
25:42;25:46;"to fight, including Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds."
25:46;25:48;"So maybe he rolls up to, oh like North Carolina"
25:48;25:50;"has a hot sauce contest, so maybe he goes"
25:50;25:52;"and it's all these like macho guys,"
25:52;25:54;"got like, you know, Jason Momoa."
25:54;25:56;"- Jason Statham."
25:56;25:57;"- Jason Statham."
25:57;25:58;"- Michael Chiklis."
25:58;26:01;"- Michael Chiklis, Ving Rhames."
26:01;26:03;"So all these like big, beefy dudes,"
26:03;26:05;"and then Chalamet rolls up to the spice thing"
26:05;26:06;"and then they're like, what the (beep),"
26:06;26:07;"what's up with this kid?"
26:07;26:09;"And then he like beats them or something"
26:09;26:11;"and they're like, you know, Chalamet, you're all right."
26:11;26:12;"We're about to go to a steakhouse."
26:12;26:14;"And he's like, well actually guys, I don't eat steak,"
26:14;26:14;"I'm vegan."
26:14;26:17;"(explosion)"
26:17;26:18;"The end, I don't know."
26:18;26:19;"Maybe that's the--"
26:19;26:20;"- Great scene."
26:20;26:22;"- That's the end of act two."
26:22;26:23;"(laughing)"
26:23;26:23;"- I'm vegan."

27:30;27:32;"This just in, this just in."
27:32;27:34;"Our producer gave us a couple secret,"
27:34;27:35;"we got a secret stash."
27:35;27:36;"Oh my God, okay."
27:36;27:37;"- Oh, it's a black hood."
27:37;27:38;"- No, this is, yeah, this is real."
27:38;27:40;"- Now one of them, one of them is called,"
27:40;27:41;"is it called the Ass Reaper?"
27:41;27:42;"(laughing)"
27:42;27:44;"It's straight up called the Ass Reaper?"
27:44;27:47;"Ass Reaper sounds like a Twitter name from 2009."
27:47;27:49;"Ass Reaper."
27:49;27:50;"- Oh, okay, this is, now we're getting into some real."
27:50;27:52;"- Okay, so now we got a secret stash."
27:52;27:53;"Okay, this is, I mean, this is."
27:53;27:54;"- Okay."
27:54;27:56;"- So Ass Reaper actually comes,"
27:56;27:57;"it looks like the Grim Reaper."
27:57;28:00;"It's a skeleton with a black hood on it."
28:00;28:01;"And what's the other one?"
28:01;28:03;"- It's Carolina Reaper sauce."
28:03;28:04;"- Oh wow, okay, this is."
28:04;28:06;"- Wait, so, okay, now Reaper."
28:06;28:08;"- That's what the one chip challenge is."
28:08;28:09;"- Okay."
28:09;28:11;"- Is derived from the Carolina Reaper."
28:11;28:12;"Oh wow."
28:12;28:13;"- So you thought you were out of the woods."
28:13;28:14;"- I did."
28:14;28:17;"- 'Cause a Reaper is a type of pepper and it's hot as hell."
28:17;28:19;"- The highest Scoville rating."
28:19;28:20;"- What rating?"
28:20;28:21;"- Of any, Scoville."
28:21;28:22;"- What's that?"
28:22;28:24;"- Don't you guys talk about this every episode and (beep)?"
28:24;28:25;"- No, man."
28:25;28:28;"- It's how hot something is, it's the Scoville."
28:28;28:30;"- Is that named after Brad Scoville?"
28:30;28:31;"- I believe so."
28:31;28:32;"- Don't they reduce it?"
28:32;28:34;"There's like a unit of measurement too, right?"
28:34;28:35;"- It's Scoville, it's a Scoville unit."
28:35;28:37;"- And they shorten it to like SV or something."
28:37;28:39;"- Is it like the Richter scale or is it exponential?"
28:39;28:40;"- Oh, I don't know."
28:40;28:41;"- That's a good question."
28:41;28:43;"- Have you had this sauce before?"
28:43;28:45;"- No, neither of these, I don't think."
28:45;28:47;"- This other bottle has a string bow tie, have you?"
28:47;28:48;"- Oh yeah."
28:48;28:51;"- So do you have like an insane hot sauce collection"
28:51;28:52;"at your house?"
28:52;28:55;"- No, 'cause I rip through them too quickly."
28:55;28:56;"- Whoa."
28:56;28:57;"- Do you think you could just drink a bottle of Tabasco"
28:57;28:58;"no problem?"
28:58;29:01;"- You know, the one thing that scares me a little bit"
29:01;29:04;"is someone in my town, like when I was 16,"
29:04;29:09;"he was bet $5 to drink a coffee mug of Taco Bell fire sauce"
29:09;29:13;"and he did it and then his eyes hemorrhaged,"
29:13;29:15;"which means the whites of your eyes turn red."
29:15;29:18;"And he worked at the CVS in my town"
29:18;29:19;"and he wasn't allowed to wear,"
29:19;29:21;"the entire whites turned red."
29:21;29:22;"And--"
29:22;29:23;"- For how long?"
29:23;29:25;"- For the whole summer,"
29:25;29:26;"you weren't allowed to wear sunglasses"
29:26;29:28;"when you worked at the CVS."
29:28;29:30;"So he would, he had--"
29:30;29:31;"- He lost his job."
29:31;29:32;"- No, he worked, he worked,"
29:32;29:35;"but like I would see him every day and like that,"
29:35;29:36;"I don't want that to happen to me."
29:36;29:40;"- That'd be a good backstory for Timothy Chalamet's character"
29:40;29:42;"in ""Vegan Spice Ed."""
29:42;29:44;"- But bae, that would be a sick look for tour next year."
29:44;29:45;"- Yeah, if I just--"
29:45;29:46;"- Red eyes."
29:46;29:48;"- All right."
29:48;29:49;"- So he's going hard, he's going hard."
29:49;29:50;"- I'm not, yeah, okay."
29:50;29:51;"- Stop showing off."
29:51;29:52;"- No, well."
29:52;29:56;"- This is the real deal."
29:56;29:57;"- Strap in."
29:57;29:59;"- It's fine, well, let's see."
29:59;30:01;"- Oh, let's, okay."
30:01;30:02;"- Folks, we got a problem."
30:02;30:03;"- No, I'm good."
30:03;30:05;"- In the first two seconds, you're no big deal."
30:05;30:06;"Now--"
30:06;30:07;"- No, still a little burn."
30:07;30:09;"- Usually this is where it would start to kick up, right?"
30:09;30:10;"- Yeah, I think so."
30:10;30:11;"I think I'm okay."
30:11;30:13;"- Is it significantly hotter"
30:13;30:15;"than number 10 on the target scale?"
30:15;30:15;"- Yeah, definitely."
30:15;30:17;"- Okay."
30:17;30:20;"- So pure Carolina Reaper bred for heat."
30:20;30:23;"The Carolina Reaper is not for the faint of heart."
30:23;30:26;"The extreme heat of the Carolina Reaper"
30:26;30:28;"is partnered with a sweet fruity flavor"
30:28;30:31;"to elevate the composition of any recipe."
30:31;30:33;"Now I'd also add, I guess,"
30:33;30:34;"the Ass Reaper's hitting me a little harder now."
30:34;30:35;"- Oh, really?"
30:35;30:36;"- Like I'm feeling a little high."
30:36;30:37;"- It's got a long tail."
30:37;30:39;"- It's a good high, but a little high."
30:39;30:42;"I'm gonna go a little more conservative with this one."
30:42;30:43;"- Yeah, be careful."
30:43;30:45;"Oh, this one looks like, is this one like thick?"
30:45;30:46;"- Yeah."
30:46;30:48;"- This is like a chunkier sauce."
30:48;30:49;"(laughing)"
30:49;30:50;"- Okay."
30:50;30:51;"- Here we go."
30:51;30:52;"- Oh, this is gonna hurt."
30:52;30:53;"This is gonna hurt."
30:53;30:55;"- On a ghost pepper chip."
30:55;30:55;"- Oh, geez."
30:55;30:57;"(laughing)"
30:57;30:58;"- This is good."
30:58;31:02;"- Right off the bat, it's significantly hotter"
31:02;31:03;"than the Ass Reaper."
31:03;31:05;"(laughing)"
31:05;31:07;"- Yeah, I'm gonna start sweating a lot, I think."
31:07;31:08;"I can feel this."
31:08;31:09;"- So this is far and away the hottest."
31:09;31:10;"- Yeah, yeah."
31:10;31:11;"- Stomach feels fine?"
31:11;31:13;"- Feels fine, yeah."
31:13;31:15;"We'll see, we can do a follow up."
31:15;31:16;"- Tingly sensation?"
31:16;31:17;"- Definitely major tingles."
31:17;31:19;"I'm feeling a little high."
31:19;31:20;"- Take a cold shower."
31:20;31:22;"(laughing)"
31:22;31:23;"Give us a ring."
32:02;32:12;"- How you feel?"
32:12;32:14;"- I feel great, man."
32:14;32:15;"I'm a little bit, I feel--"
32:15;32:16;"- Well, yeah, you started drinking water."
32:16;32:18;"- I did, and I feel, I'm like sweating"
32:18;32:21;"out of the back of my head, which is very weird."
32:21;32:24;"My pits and usual, like, you know, those are fine,"
32:24;32:26;"but the back of my head is like sweaty right now."
32:26;32:28;"- And you don't want a glass of milk or bread"
32:28;32:29;"or anything like real?"
32:29;32:30;"- I think I'll be okay."
32:30;32:32;"- Is that something that you would want in your home?"
32:32;32:33;"- Absolutely."
32:33;32:34;"- Oh, you should take it."
32:34;32:35;"- I'm like--"
32:35;32:35;"- Sick, all right."
32:35;32:37;"- So, I'm like eggs and stuff in the morning?"
32:37;32:39;"- You're gonna put that on eggs in the morning?"
32:39;32:39;"- I would."
32:39;32:41;"- I just love to think about your wife just being like,"
32:41;32:42;"what is the deal with the hot sauce?"
32:42;32:44;"(laughing)"
32:44;32:47;"- I just keep going back to that."
32:47;32:48;"Do you ever do it on, like, fruit?"
32:48;32:49;"- They do that in Mexico."
32:49;32:51;"I've done that in Mexico City, it's great."
32:51;32:52;"I don't do it, I wouldn't put it, like,"
32:52;32:53;"on grapes in the morning. - Like on a banana?"
32:53;32:55;"- Or on a banana, no, I wouldn't do that."
32:55;32:56;"That's a bridge too far, but I, you know,"
32:56;32:59;"like on, like a pineapple or whatever, like in Mexico."
32:59;33:00;"- That could be good, that's great."
33:00;33:03;"- I remember early in the Vampirican days,"
33:03;33:05;"we went to a baseball game in Mexico,"
33:05;33:08;"and everybody was eating popcorn with Tabasco,"
33:08;33:09;"and I was like, yeah, I always thought"
33:09;33:11;"popcorn kind of sucked."
33:11;33:14;"Can we agree on that, that popcorn's very overrated?"
33:14;33:15;"- Is that a controversial opinion?"
33:15;33:17;"- It's bland, I mean, you have to mess it up."
33:17;33:18;"- But then what, are you gonna put"
33:18;33:19;"that whack fake butter on it?"
33:19;33:20;"That's disgusting."
33:20;33:21;"- Real butter, dude."
33:21;33:23;"- It can be kind of, I mean, it's like--"
33:23;33:24;"- That's how I roll. - That's weird too."
33:24;33:27;"- In terms of how filling it is for the calories,"
33:27;33:30;"I understand the, there's like some benefits there."
33:30;33:31;"- Oh yes, very low-cal."
33:31;33:33;"- As a low-cal snack."
33:33;33:34;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
33:34;33:35;"- And then you put-- - It's relatively low-cal."
33:35;33:36;"- Yeah, yeah, very. - Compared to, like,"
33:36;33:37;"other stuff, compared to chips and stuff."
33:37;33:39;"- I just think it's a little messy, that's the only thing,"
33:39;33:42;"but Tabasco on popcorn really takes, like,"
33:42;33:45;"a C- snack and turns it into, like, a B+."
33:45;33:46;"- Definitely."
33:46;33:48;"- All right, great, well, thanks for coming through, Chris."
33:48;33:50;"(laughing)"
33:50;33:51;"The hell of a way to end 2018."
33:51;33:53;"(laughing)"
33:53;33:54;"- Thank you."
33:54;33:55;"- Great seeing you, man."

35:04;35:06;"Time Crisis"
35:06;35:08;"on Beats 1."
35:08;35:10;"- Seinfeld, have we gotten anywhere"
35:10;35:13;"with my Time Crisis Frosted Flakes idea?"
35:13;35:15;"I'm serious about this one, man."
35:15;35:18;"- Yeah, I mean, I definitely took the first step"
35:18;35:20;"into investigating what it would take"
35:20;35:22;"to release your own brand of Frosted Flakes."
35:22;35:24;"And was this gonna be Vampire Weekend Frosted Flakes"
35:24;35:25;"or Ezra's Frosted Flakes,"
35:25;35:28;"or was it just strictly white label Frosted Flakes?"
35:28;35:29;"- Maybe Vampire Weekend."
35:29;35:31;"That would be kind of unique when we get back on tour."
35:31;35:32;"- Yeah, I think people would like that."
35:32;35:33;"- The merch game has gone crazy."
35:33;35:37;"People out here selling $400 Varsity jackets on tour."
35:37;35:40;"By that logic, we could sell a $30 box"
35:40;35:42;"of Vampire Weekend Frosted Flakes,"
35:42;35:43;"and people would be like, ""That's a bargain."""
35:43;35:44;"- Yeah, people would love those."
35:44;35:46;"- What about Punisher Burgers Frosted Flakes?"
35:46;35:47;"(laughing)"
35:47;35:48;"I like that."
35:48;35:50;"- Would there be meat in it?"
35:50;35:51;"- No, no, just normal Frosted Flakes."
35:51;35:54;"- It's the Punisher Burgers family of products."
35:54;35:55;"- Or Bradley Cooper's Frosted Flakes."
35:55;35:59;"- Ooh, yeah, I mean, you'd probably have to get his buy-in."
35:59;36:00;"- Would you?"
36:00;36:02;"- What if we just called it Bradley's Frosted Flakes?"
36:02;36:03;"- I like that."
36:03;36:05;"- How would we know it was Bradley Cooper?"
36:05;36:06;"- Or Brad's Drinks?"
36:06;36:09;"- Oh, Brad's Drinks Frosted Flakes."
36:09;36:12;"- There's some, you know, semi-witty TC time."
36:12;36:13;"- Okay, how about this?"
36:13;36:16;"We create a character named Bradley."
36:16;36:19;"He's an anthropomorphized tiger who stands upright."
36:19;36:20;"- Nice."
36:20;36:22;"- And he wears a leather jacket."
36:22;36:23;"- He stands upright."
36:23;36:25;"(laughing)"
36:25;36:28;"- He stands upright, he wears a leather jacket, aviators."
36:28;36:31;"He directs movies and acts in them."
36:31;36:34;"- The aviators, 'cause Bradley Cooper's known for aviators?"
36:34;36:36;"- I don't know, I'm just thinking like a Hollywood guy."
36:36;36:37;"- Okay, like a cool Hollywood guy."
36:37;36:41;"Not close enough to Bradley Cooper to make any mistakes."
36:41;36:43;"- I do like the idea of working in a tiger"
36:43;36:44;"one way or another."
36:44;36:45;"So legally we need to figure out the best way"
36:45;36:49;"that we can make a tiger-branded Frosted Flakes"
36:49;36:51;"without getting in trouble."
36:51;36:53;"And just as a refresher to everybody,"
36:53;36:56;"Frosted Flakes is not trademarkable"
36:56;36:58;"because it's just describing the product."
36:58;37:01;"So we've seen store-brand Frosted Flakes before."
37:01;37:02;"So I want in on this."
37:02;37:05;"- So already we're encountering two issues."
37:05;37:07;"I think, A, and we didn't even get this far"
37:07;37:10;"in my conversation this morning with packaging attorney,"
37:10;37:12;"Eric from Chicago."
37:12;37:16;"He really stressed that there can be no misleading consumers"
37:16;37:18;"that this could be a Kellogg's product."
37:18;37:20;"And I think if I could get into his shoes here,"
37:20;37:24;"he might have an issue with an anthropomorphic tiger."
37:24;37:27;"But again, the conversation didn't even get that deep."
37:27;37:29;"- I think that's easily solvable."
37:29;37:30;"- Okay, it's a line."
37:30;37:33;"- Our boxes are gonna be so lo-fi."
37:33;37:34;"- Yeah."
37:34;37:35;"- Like homemade."
37:35;37:37;"Like clearly you can never confuse it"
37:37;37:39;"with a Kellogg's product, right?"
37:39;37:40;"- Fair enough."
37:40;37:42;"It seemed like Eric was trying to consider this"
37:42;37:46;"from every possible risk-related angle"
37:46;37:47;"'cause he cares about you"
37:47;37:50;"and he doesn't wanna see you get screwed over."
37:50;37:53;"- Well, you'd be the first one to go to prison, Seinfeld."
37:53;37:55;"- Well, wouldn't be the first time."
37:56;37:58;"- Seinfeld, you're the Michael Cohen of this enterprise."
37:58;38:01;"(laughing)"

38:42;38:44;"- What his concern was more about"
38:44;38:48;"was the idea that we would re-box Frosted Flakes"
38:48;38:50;"because I think your idea was to take"
38:50;38:52;"pre-existing Frosted Flakes,"
38:52;38:54;"take the bag out of the box,"
38:54;38:56;"and then place them in a new box."
38:56;38:57;"- Yes."
38:57;38:58;"- Well, I was just trying to make things easy."
38:58;38:59;"Oh, by the way, I'm looking online."
38:59;39:02;"I see all sorts of store brand Frosted Flakes."
39:02;39:05;"They have a white lion as a mascot."
39:05;39:07;"This one's called Frosty Corn Flakes,"
39:07;39:11;"and it looks like a big cat in a vest."
39:11;39:13;"Here's something, this is Germany."
39:13;39:16;"They're called White Flakes, and it's a polar bear."
39:16;39:18;"- Are any of these tigers?"
39:18;39:20;"'Cause it sounds like there are a lot of variations"
39:20;39:20;"and sort of."
39:20;39:23;"- Okay, yeah."
39:23;39:25;"- Large corner carnivore."
39:25;39:26;"- I'm on your side."
39:26;39:27;"Like, I'm not trying to raid on the Frosted Flakes."
39:27;39:28;"- Oh, you know what?"
39:28;39:29;"Here's an idea."
39:29;39:32;"Everybody loves cats, right?"
39:32;39:33;"- Sure."
39:33;39:34;"- There's been a recent internet meme"
39:34;39:36;"with Iken has cheeseburger."
39:36;39:40;"- Yeah, there's a cat with a piano called Piano Cat."
39:40;39:42;"- Yeah, actually, see if we can get Piano Cat on the show"
39:42;39:43;"'cause that's a hot meme."
39:43;39:44;"- Cool."
39:44;39:45;"- But anyway, the internet's shown"
39:45;39:48;"that people fricking love cats."
39:48;39:49;"So how about this?"
39:49;39:51;"Tony the Tiger, he's kind of a whack mascot"
39:51;39:54;"because people don't actually like tigers."
39:54;39:56;"(laughing)"
39:56;39:57;"Right?"
39:57;39:57;"- People hate tigers."
39:57;39:59;"- The Seinfeld, do you like tigers?"
39:59;40:00;"- Not at all."
40:00;40:02;"- If you like tigers, you gotta leave 'em alone"
40:02;40:03;"'cause they're endangered."
40:03;40:05;"And if you don't like tigers 'cause they're scary,"
40:05;40:06;"you don't wanna see them on the box."
40:06;40:11;"So what if we get a kind of orangey, really cute kitty?"
40:11;40:12;"- Like a Garfield."
40:12;40:14;"- Like a, yeah, Garfield, a cute kitty."
40:14;40:16;"- Yeah, that could work."
40:16;40:17;"Again, I have no legal background,"
40:17;40:20;"but my gut's telling me that that's different enough"
40:20;40:22;"from Tony that it would work."
40:22;40:23;"- Okay, I like this."
40:23;40:27;"- But this lawyer wanted us to go into production, right?"
40:27;40:27;"- Yeah."
40:27;40:28;"- Right, because I thought we could save some time"
40:28;40:31;"and money by just buying Frosted Flakes,"
40:31;40:34;"putting it in our box, and then selling it for 30 to $40."
40:34;40:38;"- Well, what he told me was that the actual flakes are IP."
40:38;40:40;"The flakes themselves are intellectual property."
40:40;40:42;"I think to him, maybe the analogy would be,"
40:42;40:44;"okay, let's take your music band, Vampire Weekend."
40:44;40:45;"- Yeah."
40:45;40:47;"- If somebody took your compact disc,"
40:47;40:50;"like if I made a Seinfeld 2000 CD case,"
40:50;40:52;"I put your compact disc inside,"
40:52;40:54;"I can't sell that at Sam Goody"
40:54;40:56;"because it's still essentially your product"
40:56;40:58;"that I've just dressed up different."
40:58;41:00;"- Well, if you bought it at full price from us,"
41:00;41:02;"I don't see why you couldn't sell it on your own website."
41:02;41:04;"- Well, I don't think Kellogg,"
41:04;41:06;"and again, I don't know why I'm defending the other argument,"
41:06;41:10;"but I don't think Kellogg is as generous with their IP as you."
41:10;41:11;"- All right, so long story short,"
41:11;41:13;"we gotta make our own Frosted Flakes."
41:13;41:14;"- That's what they're saying,"
41:14;41:16;"and he's referred me to some people"
41:16;41:19;"who can connect us with factories that make Frosted Flakes."
41:19;41:21;"- This is gonna be fun. - From France."
41:21;41:22;"- Yeah."
41:22;41:23;"- Okay, I'm down with that as long,"
41:23;41:25;"where are the factories?"
41:25;41:26;"- China."
41:26;41:28;"(laughing)"
41:28;41:29;"- Where do we get the best deal?"
41:29;41:30;"This actually might be a good way for us"
41:30;41:33;"to learn about international production and capital."
41:33;41:36;"Are Frosted Flakes made in America?"
41:36;41:37;"- I mean, they have to be."
41:37;41:39;"This was just a preliminary call,"
41:39;41:41;"but I'm sure there's some California factories"
41:41;41:44;"that would reduce the shipping costs and whatnot."
41:44;41:48;"- Our Frosted Flakes are made in downtown Los Angeles."
41:48;41:50;"- Yeah, I mean, if there's a factory"
41:50;41:53;"that makes Frosted Flakes in DTLA, yeah."
41:53;41:56;"- Okay, so let's find a place where we can make them."
41:56;41:57;"- Small run order is what we're finding."
41:57;41:59;"- I mean, I've done this before, you know."
41:59;42:02;"I run multiple businesses, and even with Vampire Weekend,"
42:02;42:03;"things have come up over the years,"
42:03;42:05;"we wanna make something, and it's cool,"
42:05;42:08;"and everybody's excited, and the next thing you know,"
42:08;42:10;"okay, we found one factory that can make it"
42:10;42:12;"minimum run 100,000."
42:12;42:13;"- Right."
42:13;42:16;"- Actually, he did bring up, I think he said 100,000."
42:16;42:17;"He spoke in terms of high volume."
42:17;42:18;"- Boxes?"
42:18;42:19;"- Boxes."
42:19;42:21;"Like, he was talking about scale,"
42:21;42:23;"and I'm like, this is like a limited edition,"
42:23;42:25;"like ultra rare thing."
42:25;42:27;"- We're doing like 100."
42:27;42:29;"- Yeah, so I mean, that changes things too."
42:29;42:31;"I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying there are--"
42:31;42:34;"- What if you just made the Frosted Flakes at home?"
42:34;42:36;"We start out with like 40 boxes."
42:36;42:39;"- Okay, I mean, I'm open to it."
42:39;42:41;"We're talking like, so I get Corn Flakes"
42:41;42:45;"and a thing of sugar, and I'm pouring them, like I--"
42:45;42:47;"- Well, I guess you gotta make the Corn Flakes from scratch."
42:47;42:50;"- I'm picturing a lot of, I'm picturing you with a lot"
42:50;42:52;"of like baking sheets."
42:52;42:54;"- Baking sheets and what, a mashing cord?"
42:54;42:56;"- Okay, let me break it down for you."
42:56;42:58;"You're gonna get a bunch of corn kernels,"
42:58;43:00;"you're gonna scrape them off the cob,"
43:00;43:05;"you're gonna mash them up with some water, some shortening."
43:05;43:06;"- Some sort of emulsifier."
43:06;43:08;"- Some sort of emulsifier."
43:08;43:10;"You're gonna blend it."
43:10;43:11;"You got a blender, right?"
43:11;43:12;"- No, I don't."
43:12;43:14;"- You're gonna blend it, and then individually--"
43:14;43:15;"- Oh wait, yeah, I do."
43:15;43:17;"- On a lightly greased, lightly greased, mind you."
43:17;43:19;"- How do you know how to make Frosted Flakes?"
43:19;43:20;"- Because I'm a chef."
43:20;43:23;"So on a lightly greased baking pan,"
43:23;43:25;"you're gonna take the batter."
43:25;43:26;"- Oh boy."
43:26;43:29;"- And then one by one, you're just gonna do a little dollop."
43:29;43:31;"So your average lightly greased baking pan"
43:31;43:33;"could probably hold about 150 of these."
43:33;43:34;"You're gonna preheat--"
43:34;43:35;"- So that's maybe like a tenth of a box."
43:35;43:37;"- I should've told you when you started,"
43:37;43:38;"'cause this would save you some time."
43:38;43:39;"You gotta preheat the oven."
43:39;43:41;"- Somebody would've started it."
43:41;43:44;"I'm not doing this now as you speak."
43:44;43:46;"- For people listening, Ezra's not walking me through."
43:46;43:47;"(laughing)"
43:47;43:49;"This is real time."
43:49;43:51;"- Seinfeld's on a headset in his kitchen on him."
43:51;43:54;"You could probably do two or three pans at a time."
43:54;43:56;"So by that rate, I think you could get to 40 boxes"
43:56;43:58;"easily within a week."
43:58;44:01;"- I mean, I'm down, but I think your fans would be"
44:01;44:04;"interested in knowing that you had a hand"
44:04;44:05;"in producing these flakes,"
44:05;44:07;"and I think that would significantly raise the value,"
44:07;44:10;"because I am but a lowly Twitter person,"
44:10;44:14;"and you're a globally renowned entertainer."
44:14;44:16;"- Well, I think we could put something on the boxes."
44:16;44:17;"Uncle Ezra's secret recipe."
44:17;44:19;"- Uncle Ezra's secret recipe."
44:19;44:20;"(laughing)"
45:20;45:27;"- I don't know if anybody wants to eat flakes"
45:27;45:29;"that I make in my home."
45:29;45:30;"- Okay, you know what?"
45:30;45:31;"- Personally, but."
45:31;45:33;"- This is a horse of a different color now."
45:33;45:35;"We're talking about 10 boxes,"
45:35;45:37;"retailing at 1500 bucks each,"
45:37;45:40;"each handmade by Seinfeld 2000,"
45:40;45:42;"original art by Jake,"
45:42;45:43;"and they're called Frosted Flakes."
45:43;45:45;"- Just throw that into the mix."
45:45;45:48;"- Jake's gonna hand paint each box."
45:48;45:48;"You know what?"
45:48;45:50;"10,000 each box."
45:50;45:51;"We're doing 10 boxes."
45:51;45:52;"- Now we're talking."
45:52;45:53;"- Uncle Ezra's secret recipe,"
45:53;45:57;"handmade by Seinfeld in his house in Los Angeles,"
45:57;46:00;"each box hand painted by Jake, $10,000,"
46:00;46:02;"numbered and signed by the artists."
46:02;46:05;"- You know, this sounds like something that won't age well"
46:05;46:06;"because it's so expensive"
46:06;46:08;"that people will want to keep it, I think,"
46:08;46:10;"because you've got, you know,"
46:10;46:11;"this is art is what I'm trying to say."
46:11;46:13;"And so I don't think anybody would eat it."
46:13;46:14;"And so what I'm suggesting"
46:14;46:16;"is that maybe the flakes are fake at this point."
46:16;46:18;"Like they're plastic flakes."
46:18;46:21;"And this is more of a piece than a foodstuff."
46:21;46:22;"- No, because we could also do,"
46:22;46:24;"when this is in the Whitney Biennial,"
46:24;46:26;"it'll be like a whole room"
46:26;46:28;"where there's like photos about what happened,"
46:28;46:29;"and there's the actual box."
46:29;46:30;"And then there'll be like,"
46:30;46:31;"you go behind some curtains"
46:31;46:33;"into one of those like dark screening rooms,"
46:33;46:35;"and there'll be an art film that I made"
46:35;46:38;"that's just a time-lapse of you spending a week"
46:38;46:40;"making them in your kitchen."
46:40;46:41;"- Jake, how are you with animals?"
46:41;46:44;"I've only seen you painting, you know,"
46:44;46:46;"edifices and stuff and landscapes."
46:46;46:47;"- Edifices."
46:47;46:48;"- Are you--"
46:48;46:49;"- Facades, edifices."
46:49;46:51;"- You know, various--"
46:51;46:52;"- Mantard roofs."
46:52;46:53;"- Yes."
46:53;46:54;"- I'm great with animals."
46:54;46:55;"- Really?"
46:55;46:56;"It sounds like we got something here."
46:56;46:57;"- Yeah, we're good."
46:57;46:58;"- That it's a deal."
46:58;47:00;"- Okay, this week,"
47:00;47:02;"you mess around in the kitchen a little bit,"
47:02;47:05;"make just two little like, you know,"
47:05;47:09;"sandwich bags worth of frozen flakes,"
47:09;47:12;"and then Uber deliver one to me and one to Jake."
47:12;47:13;"We'll try 'em, see what we think."
47:13;47:15;"- Time crisis test kitchen."
47:15;47:16;"- Take it from there."
47:16;47:17;"- Like Uber Eats?"
47:17;47:20;"Or I'm just taking an Uber with it to you guys."
47:20;47:22;"- You're sending the baggie in an Uber."
47:22;47:23;"- Vehicle to me."
47:23;47:25;"- Isn't there something called Uber Delivers?"
47:25;47:26;"- I don't know."
47:26;47:28;"It sounds like something."
47:28;47:30;"- I'm pretty sure there's Uber Deliver."
47:30;47:31;"Okay, long story short,"
47:31;47:32;"you call the Uber to your house,"
47:32;47:33;"you go down and say,"
47:33;47:35;"""Hey, listen, I won't be riding with you,"
47:35;47:36;"""but I got some precious cargo."""
47:36;47:38;"Drop this off at the location."
47:38;47:39;"You're allowed to do that."
47:39;47:41;"- It sounds like a lot of unnecessary effort."
47:41;47:44;"You know, I feel like I could find ways to cut quarters,"
47:44;47:45;"but if this is how you guys wanna--"
47:45;47:47;"- Well, first, we're getting ahead of ourselves."
47:47;47:50;"You gotta get in touch with the factories"
47:50;47:54;"and see if anybody's down to do 1,000."
47:54;47:54;"- Sounds great."
47:54;47:55;"- 1,000 boxes."
47:55;47:56;"And maybe they'll say,"
47:56;47:57;"""Listen, if you do 100,000,"
47:57;48:00;"""I can get the unit price down to whatever, 50 cents."
48:00;48:03;"""This is gonna cost you $4 a pop if you do 1,000."""
48:03;48:04;"- Not a problem."
48:04;48:05;"- Not a problem, sir."
48:05;48:06;"Not a problem."
48:06;48:07;"That's the next step."
48:07;48:09;"- All right, I'll keep you posted."
48:09;48:11;"- And if that doesn't work, get your apron ready,"
48:11;48:13;"because Seinfeld, you're gonna be cooking up"
48:13;48:14;"cornflakes for a week."
48:14;48:17;"- Oh boy, actually starting to get into this."
48:17;48:18;"- You get your whole family involved."
48:18;48:20;"You're cooking up the cornflakes."
48:20;48:22;"Wife's painting the frosting on them"
48:22;48:24;"with one of those barbecue brushes."
48:24;48:26;"- Oh yeah, that sounds like something she'd like to do."
48:26;48:27;"- It could be fun."
48:27;48:34;"- And these are CBD-laced or just regular frosting?"
48:34;48:36;"- They're just regular, but experiment a little bit."
48:36;48:37;"Maybe-- - Experiment a little bit."
48:37;48:38;"- With hot raisins."
48:38;48:40;"Should we put Carolina Reapers in it?"
48:40;48:42;"- Raisins are big right now."
48:42;48:43;"- Oh."
48:43;48:44;"- I think raisins are--"
48:44;48:45;"- What, ugh, people put raisins in the--"
48:45;48:47;"- I'm just picturing a product"
48:47;48:49;"that's frosted flakes with raisins."
48:49;48:51;"That sucks, right?"
48:51;48:52;"- I've had it."
48:52;48:52;"- Wait, is that a thing?"
48:52;48:53;"- That was a thing."
48:53;48:54;"- Is there frosted raisin?"
48:54;48:56;"- There's frosted raisin bread, that's what it is."
48:56;48:57;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
48:57;48:59;"- Okay, I got one more idea."
48:59;48:59;"- Shoot."
48:59;49:00;"- This one would be easier,"
49:00;49:04;"because I'm sure we could find a wholesale raisin supplier."
49:04;49:05;"- Yep, easily."
49:05;49:08;"- We make a product called Oops All Raisins."
49:08;49:12;"It's unclear what the original cereal we're referencing is."
49:12;49:14;"All it says is Oops All Raisins,"
49:14;49:17;"and it's just a shockingly large box of raisins"
49:17;49:20;"with original art by Jake retailing at $10,000 a pop."
49:20;49:22;"- I like it, it's mysterious."
49:22;49:24;"It's like, what was this supposed to be?"
49:24;49:28;"It's on trend with all the other oops, accidental snacks."
49:28;49:30;"Oops, Keebler Elves made a mistake."
49:30;49:31;"Now it's all chocolate."
49:31;49:32;"- Yeah, exactly."
49:32;49:33;"- Yeah."
49:33;49:34;"Okay."
49:34;49:36;"(laughing)"
49:36;49:38;"- Maybe we call it, what does mia culpa mean?"
49:38;49:40;"Is it like my confession, my fault?"
49:40;49:41;"So what does mia culpa mean?"
49:41;49:42;"Let me get a number crunch on that."
49:42;49:44;"- Yeah, isn't it just my bad?"
49:44;49:45;"- But it's like a noun, people would be like,"
49:45;49:46;"his mia culpa."
49:46;49:47;"- Oh yeah."
49:47;49:49;"An acknowledgement of one's fault or error."
49:49;49:51;"Well, whose fault is that?"
49:51;49:53;"Quote, mia culpa, Frank said."
49:53;49:55;"- It is like my bad."
49:55;49:58;"- Mia culpa is a Latin phrase that means through my fault."
49:58;49:59;"What do you want, mia culpa cereal?"
49:59;50:00;"- I don't know."
50:00;50:01;"- Oh, I see, this is like the fit."
50:01;50:05;"- Maybe it's, take a photo of like a,"
50:05;50:08;"you know, an old statue of Marcus Aurelius,"
50:08;50:10;"and then just say mia culpa, raisins."
50:10;50:12;"Very heavy, I like it."
50:12;50:14;"- Okay, so anyway, by next year,"
50:14;50:15;"I wanna get this up and running."
50:15;50:18;"- So there's like the Vampire Weekend merch table,"
50:18;50:22;"and it's like T-shirts, long sleeves, vinyl."
50:22;50:23;"- Yep."
50:23;50:24;"- And then cereal."
50:24;50:25;"- 50 bucks a pop."
50:25;50:27;"- Yeah, I think we just stay on it,"
50:27;50:29;"and just figure out a way to make it happen,"
50:29;50:31;"as we always do on TC."
50:31;50:32;"- All right, thank you."

51:46;51:48;"- So you guys covered it?"
51:48;51:48;"- A little bit."
51:48;51:49;"- Not a full version?"
51:49;51:50;"- No, we didn't do the full version."
51:50;51:51;"- Oh, okay."
51:51;51:53;"- But our full version is roughly 11 minutes long."
51:53;51:54;"- Well, that's what I know,"
51:54;51:57;"and I was like, I saw on the internet somewhere"

52:05;52:07;"- There's a GQ event."
52:07;52:08;"- Gentlemen's Quarterly."
52:08;52:10;"- The Gentlemen's Quarterly event that they were having"
52:10;52:13;"where the editor-in-chief was interviewing different people"
52:13;52:15;"and they asked to interview me."
52:15;52:17;"So we kind of had a brief conversation."
52:17;52:18;"- Who's the editor-in-chief?"

52:27;52:29;"kind of generally about music."
52:29;52:30;"- In front of an audience."
52:30;52:31;"- In front of an audience."
52:31;52:33;"And then, as kind of a fun surprise,"
52:33;52:35;"everybody else came out and Vampiroigan performed."
52:35;52:38;"And we did a fun little set that was,"

53:23;53:25;"- And I was layered up 'cause it was cold in New York."
53:25;53:28;"And I didn't realize, I took off my winter jacket"
53:28;53:30;"and then I took off my polar fleece."
53:30;53:33;"And underneath that was my new black long sleeve"
53:33;53:36;"""8 Minute Cape Cod"" slash ""This Show Rules."""
53:36;53:37;"- In ""Joker Man"" on the back."
53:37;53:39;"- But then, shout out to the New York City"
53:39;53:40;"time crisis community."
53:40;53:42;"There was like a good eight to 12 TC heads"
53:42;53:44;"that rolled out to the book signing."
53:44;53:45;"- Oh, sick."
53:45;53:47;"- But then I was wearing my time crisis merch."
53:47;53:49;"I felt a little dorky."
53:49;53:50;"- Right, did you explain to them?"
53:50;53:51;"- I kinda did."
53:51;53:52;"I was like, listen, I didn't mean--"
53:52;53:55;"- I'm an LA guy, I'm not used to having all these layers on."
53:55;53:56;"- Yeah, over my head."
53:56;53:58;"- Yeah, so anyway, we did a nice little set,"
53:58;53:59;"kinda history of the band."
53:59;54:00;"And then while we were there,"
54:00;54:02;"because we have been rehearsing a lot,"
54:02;54:04;"we decided to bust out just the first two verses"
54:04;54:05;"of ""Joker Man."""
54:05;54:06;"- With a solo in there?"
54:06;54:09;"- Not really, no, we just kinda did it."
54:09;54:10;"Partially because it's really on me."
54:10;54:12;"It's a lot of lyrics to learn."
54:12;54:12;"- Yeah."
54:12;54:14;"- But I know the first two verses."
54:14;54:16;"- Was there like a glint of recognition in the crowd"
54:16;54:19;"or was it just like, just like, what is this?"
54:19;54:20;"- It was like a seated event"
54:20;54:22;"'cause people were there to watch it talk."
54:22;54:23;"- Right."
54:23;54:24;"- So already it was like hard to read people."
54:24;54:26;"Got a great enthusiastic response."
54:26;54:27;"Also felt like, you know,"
54:27;54:29;"let's just give them a taste of ""Joker Man."""
54:29;54:30;"- Yeah."
54:30;54:31;"- Leave 'em wanting more."
54:31;54:33;"But it was fun and you know what,"
54:33;54:35;"like now people know that Van Proven is working"
54:35;54:36;"on a ""Joker Man"" cover."
54:36;54:37;"It's big news."
54:37;54:40;"- Was Brian doing the Knopfler riff"
54:40;54:41;"or just kinda making up his own thing?"
54:41;54:43;"- He did some of the Knopfler stuff."
54:43;54:44;"We had Will Buckethead, Kanzanieri,"
54:44;54:47;"also bringing out some of the funky reggae vibe"
54:47;54:48;"by playing clav on it."
54:48;54:50;"He's getting a little funkier"
54:50;54:51;"because there's no clav on the recording."
54:51;54:52;"But it felt pretty good."
54:52;54:54;"- And that's a demanding song for Beya."
54:54;54:56;"- Oh yeah, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
54:56;54:57;"- That's relentless."
54:57;54:58;"- For the bassist, it doesn't let up."

55:01;55:02;"No breaks."
55:02;55:02;"- Yeah."
55:02;55:04;"- But yeah, I'm excited to unveil"
55:04;55:06;"the 11 minute version sometime next year."
55:06;55:08;"Man, I can't wait for these shows next year."

55:34;55:36;"- I mean, we gotta think about, yeah,"
55:36;55:37;"should we extend it?"
55:37;55:38;"Should we do something special?"
55:38;55:40;"Although, I'm also kind of into the idea,"
55:40;55:41;"like, if in the set,"
55:41;55:43;"like, we're nailing the Vampire Weekend songs,"
55:43;55:45;"we're doing our thing with them,"

01:03:46;01:03:46;"- I think he was."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- Oh, so it adds up."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"Yeah, he wasn't with them in the mid '80s."

01:05:04;01:05:06;"This would be too on the nose as a Bruce song."
01:05:06;01:05:08;"- Oh yeah, Jersey Girl?"
01:05:08;01:05:12;"- Also, it's literally about, you got a Jersey girl"
01:05:12;01:05:13;"that you're going to see down the shore,"
01:05:13;01:05:15;"and that's where everything's all right."
01:05:15;01:05:17;"And then the final like sad verse"
01:05:17;01:05:20;"is that he finally gets there to take her out,"
01:05:20;01:05:22;"and she's probably a working class girl."
01:05:22;01:05:25;"She'd been working her ass off, fast asleep on the bed."
01:05:25;01:05:27;"He said, ""You know what, we only got this one moment."

01:05:28;01:05:31;"- Oh yeah, damn."
01:05:31;01:05:34;"Clarence McMahon."
01:05:34;01:05:39;"- This is like an EDM song, the Peaks and Valleys."
01:05:39;01:05:44;"- There's the break, and then Clarence's solo."
01:05:44;01:05:47;"Yeah, that's funny."
01:05:47;01:05:49;"It would be kind of too on the nose."
01:05:50;01:05:51;"- I don't know, man."
01:05:51;01:05:52;"If he had written that, and that was like"
01:05:52;01:05:54;"on like side four of the river, I would have been all in."
01:05:54;01:05:56;"- I mean, it's a great song."
01:05:56;01:05:57;"- Yeah."
01:05:57;01:05:58;"- Yeah, I don't know, the tone seems a little bit"
01:05:58;01:06:00;"on the nose for Bruce."
01:06:00;01:06:02;"You know what, shut up!"
01:06:02;01:06:04;"- Was there ever a Bruce reference in The Sopranos?"
01:06:04;01:06:06;"- That's a great question."
01:06:06;01:06:08;"- I only watched the show once, years ago."
01:06:08;01:06:10;"- I've watched The Sopranos twice."
01:06:10;01:06:11;"I'm just so in."
01:06:11;01:06:12;"- I know you're in."
01:06:12;01:06:15;"- It's so powerful to me, I get scared to watch it."
01:06:15;01:06:18;"I've been like, I've got the first season on my iPad."
01:06:18;01:06:19;"- Wow."
01:06:19;01:06:20;"- I've been on all the trips, I've been like,"
01:06:20;01:06:20;"ready to watch it."
01:06:20;01:06:22;"There's just almost no show that just,"
01:06:22;01:06:24;"I think that was the last good show."
01:06:24;01:06:25;"- It's your roots, man."
01:06:25;01:06:27;"- I also truly think that that's like far and away"
01:06:27;01:06:29;"the best TV show, and I don't think anything"
01:06:29;01:06:32;"in the peak TV era since then has come close."
01:06:32;01:06:32;"- Come close?"
01:06:32;01:06:33;"Come on."
01:06:33;01:06:36;"- The Sopranos is true art."
01:06:36;01:06:36;"- It's great, don't get me wrong."
01:06:36;01:06:38;"- And I don't wanna talk (beep)"
01:06:38;01:06:39;"but there's a lot of shows these days"
01:06:39;01:06:41;"that people say are--"
01:06:41;01:06:42;"- Well, for sure."
01:06:42;01:06:44;"Well, you're not into Daredevil season three?"
01:06:44;01:06:46;"- No, at least Daredevil's a superhero show"
01:06:46;01:06:47;"and they're just having fun,"
01:06:47;01:06:49;"but I haven't seen Daredevil season three,"
01:06:49;01:06:51;"so I'm not gonna hate on Daredevil."
01:06:51;01:06:52;"I bet Daredevil's sick."
01:06:52;01:06:54;"Anyway, for me, whatever, that's just one man's opinion,"
01:06:54;01:06:57;"but The Sopranos to me is so heavy."
01:06:57;01:06:59;"Have I talked about Sopranos on Time Crisis?"
01:06:59;01:07:00;"- I mean, it's come up."
01:07:00;01:07:02;"- Seinfeld, how many episodes of Time Crisis"
01:07:02;01:07:03;"have I talked about The Sopranos on?"
01:07:03;01:07:06;"- Just one, episode 13."
01:07:06;01:07:07;"- Okay."
01:07:07;01:07:08;"- I'm gonna say like four."
01:07:08;01:07:10;"- Look at Seinfeld with the number crunching."
01:07:10;01:07:11;"- Yeah."
01:07:11;01:07:12;"- Okay."
01:07:12;01:07:15;"The Sopranos to me, I can loop it back to Springsteen."
01:07:15;01:07:18;"For a certain type of person from New Jersey, it is,"
01:07:18;01:07:20;"and I normally don't care about this stuff."
01:07:20;01:07:22;"Like, there's a lot of stuff from New Jersey"
01:07:22;01:07:23;"that I'm not that enthused about,"
01:07:23;01:07:24;"but Bruce Springsteen and The Sopranos,"
01:07:24;01:07:26;"for a certain type of person from New Jersey,"
01:07:26;01:07:29;"it is hard to overstate the way"
01:07:29;01:07:31;"in which they capture the mood."
01:07:31;01:07:33;"And honestly, I'll put Bruce at a close second"
01:07:33;01:07:34;"to The Sopranos."
01:07:34;01:07:35;"- Wow."
01:07:35;01:07:37;"- The Sopranos also slightly more my era."
01:07:37;01:07:38;"That came on TV."
01:07:38;01:07:40;"I didn't watch it originally, but you know,"
01:07:40;01:07:42;"that came on TV when I was, you know,"
01:07:42;01:07:44;"a young adult, 14. - Teens, yeah."
01:07:44;01:07:45;"- You know, and I love Leonard Cohen"
01:07:45;01:07:47;"and I've heard people talk about the kind of reverence"
01:07:47;01:07:49;"that Montrealers have for Leonard Cohen"
01:07:49;01:07:52;"as a guy who not only they're proud of, you know,"
01:07:52;01:07:54;"as a native son of the city,"
01:07:54;01:07:57;"but somebody who has like a song like ""Suzanne"""
01:07:57;01:07:59;"somehow captures the mood of the city"
01:07:59;01:08:01;"in a way that they almost find it like hard to explain"
01:08:01;01:08:02;"to other people."
01:08:02;01:08:04;"And as an outsider, you can almost guess that."
01:08:04;01:08:06;"Like ""Suzanne"" is such a vibey song."
01:08:06;01:08:09;"But you know, what's so specific about that to Montreal?"
01:08:09;01:08:11;"They talk about the river, I don't know."
01:08:11;01:08:11;"- Yeah."
01:08:11;01:08:13;"- But that's how I feel about The Sopranos."
01:08:13;01:08:14;"There's something about the mood about it."
01:08:14;01:08:17;"And it all was shot so close to where I grew up."
01:08:17;01:08:19;"The opening credits, I remember the first time I saw it,"
01:08:19;01:08:21;"I was so familiar with every one of those shots"
01:08:21;01:08:22;"in the opening credits. - Wow."
01:08:22;01:08:24;"- Like, you know, going back and forth"
01:08:24;01:08:25;"to my grandparents' house in New York,"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"going in and out of the Lincoln Tunnel."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"I really could write a whole essay about the opening scene."
01:08:30;01:08:32;"And then this is also a weird thing."
01:08:32;01:08:34;"You know, my mom was a therapist."
01:08:34;01:08:35;"- Yep."
01:08:35;01:08:35;"- Once I asked her about this,"
01:08:35;01:08:38;"'cause at some point in The Sopranos,"
01:08:38;01:08:42;"they make it clear that Lorraine Bracco,"
01:08:42;01:08:43;"the therapist character's office,"
01:08:43;01:08:45;"was in the same town that my mom's office was in."
01:08:45;01:08:46;"- Wow. - It's weird."
01:08:46;01:08:47;"And I said to her, I was like,"
01:08:47;01:08:48;"""Did people ever bring that up?"""
01:08:48;01:08:50;"She's like, ""Oh yeah, a few times."""
01:08:50;01:08:51;"- Did your mom watch it?"
01:08:51;01:08:51;"- I don't think so."
01:08:51;01:08:54;"I think she found it too violent."
01:08:54;01:08:55;"I'll fact check that later."
01:08:55;01:08:58;"But the mood of that show, it's like,"
01:08:58;01:09:00;"you know, obviously I'm not Italian,"
01:09:00;01:09:03;"but the mood of it, the atmosphere, the setting,"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"the vibe, as Leonard Cohen is to Montreal or Quebec,"
01:09:06;01:09:07;"The Sopranos is to New Jersey."
01:09:07;01:09:10;"And Springsteen's the other kind of big one."
01:09:10;01:09:11;"I also think people forget a lot"
01:09:11;01:09:13;"that Bruce Springsteen is Italian."
01:09:13;01:09:15;"- That had not occurred to me."
01:09:15;01:09:16;"- This sounds like something I would have talked about"
01:09:16;01:09:18;"on Time Crisis before."
01:09:18;01:09:19;"- Number crunch on that, Seinfeld?"
01:09:19;01:09:20;"- Seinfeld, how many times have I referenced"
01:09:20;01:09:22;"the fact that Bruce Springsteen's Italian?"
01:09:22;01:09:24;"- Somehow I read his memoir and I don't remember that."
01:09:24;01:09:26;"- He talks about the fact,"
01:09:26;01:09:27;"in the first two chapters of the book,"
01:09:27;01:09:29;"that he's half Irish, half Italian."
01:09:29;01:09:31;"'Cause he said Springsteen is like"
01:09:31;01:09:33;"some long forgotten Dutch ancestor's name,"
01:09:33;01:09:35;"but really he grew up thinking of himself"
01:09:35;01:09:36;"as being half Irish, half Italian."
01:09:36;01:09:37;"- That did not occur to me."
01:09:37;01:09:40;"- I have a feeling I did talk about this on TC before,"
01:09:40;01:09:41;"'cause I was like, what would have been"
01:09:41;01:09:43;"Bruce's Italian last name?"
01:09:43;01:09:45;"Seinfeld, let me get a number crunch on that."
01:09:45;01:09:48;"What was the Italian side of his family's last name?"
01:09:48;01:09:49;"- Oh, let me just, you know,"
01:09:49;01:09:51;"it's gonna take me a little bit to check the database."
01:09:51;01:09:52;"- Let me get a number crunch."
01:09:52;01:09:53;"- Sure."
01:09:53;01:09:55;"- Maybe his mom was the Italian one?"
01:09:55;01:09:57;"- Yeah, she was a legal secretary."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"- What was her last name, her maiden name?"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"- Before she married Doug Springfield."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"- Springsteen, that is Doug, that's right."
01:10:04;01:10:05;"- I remember thinking that was funny"
01:10:05;01:10:07;"that his dad's name was Doug."
01:10:07;01:10:09;"- Nick just found a Reddit thread,"
01:10:09;01:10:12;"references to The Sopranos on Springsteen."
01:10:12;01:10:15;"Okay, this person started, they can only remember one"
01:10:15;01:10:17;"where Chrissy references his lyrics,"
01:10:17;01:10:19;"""The highway was jammed with broken heroes"
01:10:19;01:10:21;"""on a last chance power drive."""
01:10:21;01:10:24;"Okay, I guess there's one, this is hilarious."
01:10:24;01:10:27;"Tony tells the feds he already owns the Springsteen box set"
01:10:27;01:10:29;"in I Dream of Jeannie Cusimano."
01:10:29;01:10:31;"- What's the Trax box set?"
01:10:31;01:10:32;"- I bet he's talking about the live box set."
01:10:32;01:10:34;"- Oh, the live box set."
01:10:34;01:10:35;"- So that means--"
01:10:35;01:10:36;"- 'Cause you know Trax, right?"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"That's like mid-90s, that would have been--"
01:10:38;01:10:39;"- That had some deep cuts."
01:10:39;01:10:42;"- Perfect for, like Tony just bought the like"
01:10:42;01:10:46;"four CD Trax box set in like '96."
01:10:46;01:10:49;"- No, I feel like Tony had the '75 to '95 live box set."
01:10:49;01:10:50;"- Vinyl or CD?"
01:10:50;01:10:53;"You think Tony was a vinyl guy?"
01:10:53;01:10:53;"- Maybe."
01:10:53;01:10:56;"- Oh, dude, you know what's a sick cinematic depiction"
01:10:56;01:10:58;"of a Jersey-based Springsteen fan?"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"- Yeah."
01:10:59;01:11:01;"- Is Sylvester Stallone in Copland."
01:11:01;01:11:03;"- Oh, he's a Jersey--"
01:11:03;01:11:05;"- He's a Jersey cop and he goes back to his place,"
01:11:05;01:11:08;"his like sad apartment that's like in Hoboken or something,"
01:11:08;01:11:11;"and he puts on, there's a like close shot of him"
01:11:11;01:11:12;"putting the needle on the record"
01:11:12;01:11:15;"and he's listening to Nebraska."
01:11:15;01:11:15;"- Whoa."
01:11:15;01:11:16;"- And it's like, whoa."
01:11:16;01:11:17;"- That's heavy."
01:11:17;01:11:18;"- Very."
01:11:18;01:11:20;"- How we doing, Seinfeld?"
01:11:20;01:11:25;"- Yeah, Springsteen's mother's last maiden name is Zirilli."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"- Oh yeah, Zirilli."
01:11:27;01:11:28;"I know that there's an old time, Chris,"
01:11:28;01:11:32;"we talked about this, like how your name can, you know,"
01:11:32;01:11:34;"make people think of you a certain way."
01:11:34;01:11:37;"Even though most of us have some various heritages,"
01:11:37;01:11:39;"people from different countries, places,"
01:11:39;01:11:41;"ethnicities, whatever."
01:11:41;01:11:42;"So I'm just saying, imagine this guy was Bruce Zirilli"
01:11:42;01:11:44;"from New Jersey."
01:11:44;01:11:46;"It just wouldn't be different."
01:11:46;01:11:47;"- He would have had a band name."
01:11:47;01:11:50;"- Or maybe his Italian-ness would have taken center stage"
01:11:50;01:11:51;"and I don't know."
01:11:51;01:11:53;"- Yeah, wow, that's crazy."
01:11:53;01:11:55;"- But anyway, I love the idea that it's canon"
01:11:55;01:11:57;"that in The Sopranos, Tony owns a box set"
01:11:57;01:11:58;"and he's probably listened to Jersey Girl."
01:11:58;01:12:00;"I love the idea that Tony was at the concert"
01:12:00;01:12:02;"where he first played Jersey Girl."
01:12:02;01:12:04;"- Oh yeah, back in '84."

01:12:39;01:12:41;"And some of your favorite Bruce deep cuts."
01:12:41;01:12:44;"Sincerely, Riley Andrews, still a One Fridge owner."
01:12:44;01:12:45;"Well, all right, that's nice."
01:12:45;01:12:47;"We kind of already answered his question."
01:12:47;01:12:49;"One of my favorite Bruce cuts is his live cover"
01:12:49;01:12:52;"of Tom Waits' Jersey Girl."
01:12:52;01:12:54;"I don't know, I can't really speak to the Broadway format."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"I mean, Bruce is like a great storyteller."
01:12:56;01:12:59;"- That's in the live box set."
01:12:59;01:13:00;"- Right."
01:13:00;01:13:02;"- Before the river, there's that classic monologue"
01:13:02;01:13:04;"when he goes down to the payphone."
01:13:04;01:13:06;"I mean, he has really long hair and he calls us."
01:13:06;01:13:08;"He's, ""I'm on the phone all night with my girl."""
01:13:08;01:13:10;"And then he goes to the draft board"
01:13:10;01:13:12;"and the draft board turns him down."
01:13:12;01:13:13;"And then he goes back to his father's house"
01:13:13;01:13:16;"and his father's sitting there at the kitchen table."
01:13:16;01:13:18;"And he's like, ""Dad, they turned me down."""
01:13:18;01:13:22;"And my dad's like, ""That's good, that's good."""
01:13:22;01:13:23;"And then they go right into the river."
01:13:23;01:13:24;"- And I feel like there's some other ones"
01:13:24;01:13:26;"where he has some funny jokes."
01:13:26;01:13:29;"He gets some laughs, I think, in some of the earlier ones."
01:13:29;01:13:32;"Anyway, who else could do a Bruce-type,"
01:13:32;01:13:35;"essentially storyteller's Broadway show?"
01:13:35;01:13:37;"- I mean, he's built for it."
01:13:37;01:13:38;"- Bob Pollard?"
01:13:38;01:13:40;"- Yeah, it'd be great."
01:13:40;01:13:42;"- Just an acoustic storyteller set?"
01:13:42;01:13:44;"I mean, Bruce, who has the fan base?"
01:13:44;01:13:47;"I mean, in a funny way, that's what Billy Joel's been doing"
01:13:47;01:13:50;"with his monthly show at Madison Square Garden."
01:13:50;01:13:52;"- Does he get super anecdotal on the mic?"
01:13:52;01:13:54;"- Definitely not like Bruce, but he's,"
01:13:54;01:13:55;"you know, it's pretty loose."
01:13:55;01:13:57;"So he'll be telling stories, cracking jokes."
01:13:57;01:14:02;"- I wonder if the Bruce thing was scripted or?"
01:14:02;01:14:03;"- As I understand it, it was scripted."
01:14:03;01:14:04;"- Okay."
01:14:04;01:14:06;"- Yeah, every night he's doing the same thing."
01:14:06;01:14:09;"You know, he chose the songs to provide a narrative"
01:14:09;01:14:10;"and talk about life and things like that."
01:14:10;01:14:11;"- Yeah."
01:14:11;01:14:12;"- Do you have a favorite deep cut Bruce song?"
01:14:12;01:14:15;"- I was just thinking, in terms of the cinematic universe."
01:14:15;01:14:17;"Did you ever watch that show?"
01:14:17;01:14:18;"Okay, this is kind of deep."
01:14:18;01:14:21;"HBO miniseries called ""Show Me a Hero."""
01:14:21;01:14:22;"- Oh yeah, I love that."
01:14:22;01:14:24;"- With Oscar Isaac playing a Yonkers."
01:14:24;01:14:27;"- Yeah, and they're talking about the housing drama."
01:14:27;01:14:30;"- Yeah, and it opens, every episode opened"
01:14:30;01:14:31;"with a different Bruce cut, I think."
01:14:31;01:14:34;"- Yeah, I think the first one opened with ""Hungry Heart."""
01:14:34;01:14:37;"- No, it opened with, ""And I gave it a name."""
01:14:37;01:14:38;"That's my deep cut."
01:14:38;01:14:39;"- Oh, what song is that?"
01:14:39;01:14:41;"- It's called ""Gave It a Name."""
01:14:41;01:14:43;"It's on the tracks box set."

01:16:40;01:16:40;"- Yeah."

01:16:49;01:16:51;"It sounds like the river,"

01:16:52;01:16:54;"I was like, ""Oh, is this a weird outtake from the river?"""
01:16:54;01:16:56;"I couldn't believe it was from 2007."
01:16:56;01:16:57;"- I mean, knowing Bruce,"
01:16:57;01:16:58;"it's possible he wrote the song then."

01:17:23;01:17:26;"dropping a great album in his early 80s."
01:17:26;01:17:28;"- Oh, big time."
01:17:28;01:17:30;"Just another ""Ghost of Tom Jode"" style."
01:17:30;01:17:31;"- Yeah, it'd probably be super dark."
01:17:31;01:17:34;"Maybe you should wait for his ""Sopranos"" ballad until then."
01:17:34;01:17:38;"- He'll do a weird reflection on the Trump era."
01:17:38;01:17:39;"- Yeah."
01:17:39;01:17:44;"- A couple years after that ends, in like 2040."
01:17:44;01:17:44;"- Oh, God."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"- I don't know."
01:17:46;01:17:49;"- Here's a great quote from Stephen Van Zandt."
01:17:49;01:17:51;"My relationship with Bruce was the same relationship"
01:17:51;01:17:53;"that Silvio had with Tony Soprano."
01:17:53;01:17:54;"- Wow."
01:17:54;01:17:56;"- Silvio was not afraid of Tony."
01:17:56;01:17:57;"Bruce and I grew up together,"

01:18:07;01:18:10;"I was a very good consigliere."
01:18:10;01:18:11;"- So he's saying like the other guys"
01:18:11;01:18:14;"were a little bit intimidated 'cause Bruce was the big dog."
01:18:14;01:18:16;"Stevie was the one guy that was like,"
01:18:16;01:18:18;"""Bruce, shut the (beep) up."""
01:18:18;01:18:19;"- Yeah, he could probably talk straight to him"
01:18:19;01:18:21;"and he could also be that go-between"
01:18:21;01:18:22;"to give him some advice."

01:22:30;01:22:31;"- Heatcans."
01:22:31;01:22:35;"- He set like a flamethrower on Joe Pesci's head."
01:22:35;01:22:37;"- The most brutal one that I always think about"
01:22:37;01:22:41;"is that basically Daniel Stern, one of the other brothers,"
01:22:41;01:22:42;"he ends up in the basement."
01:22:42;01:22:44;"He's already like falling through a floor,"
01:22:44;01:22:45;"and then he's like crawling up,"
01:22:45;01:22:47;"he's all (beep) up crawling up the stairs,"
01:22:47;01:22:50;"and he like covered the stairs with tar,"
01:22:50;01:22:53;"so his like shoe gets stuck, then his sock gets stuck,"
01:22:53;01:22:55;"but he keeps moving, and then finally,"
01:22:55;01:22:59;"he's got his bare foot, and he just has a straight up nail,"
01:22:59;01:23:01;"and he just like, his foot, and so he's like steps up,"
01:23:01;01:23:03;"and then his foot just goes right on."
01:23:03;01:23:05;"You remember being as a kid?"
01:23:05;01:23:06;"I remember like my mom would always be like,"
01:23:06;01:23:08;"this movie's so violent, this is so (beep) up,"
01:23:08;01:23:10;"be like, mom, it's Home Alone, it's amazing,"
01:23:10;01:23:12;"Macaulay Culkin's the man, and I even remember as a kid"
01:23:12;01:23:15;"seeing the nail just like inch into this dude's foot"
01:23:15;01:23:17;"and being like, okay, you probably have a point there."
01:23:17;01:23:18;"That's gratuitous."
01:23:18;01:23:20;"- Yeah, that sounds like some Wile E. Coyote"
01:23:20;01:23:24;"Road Runner level of just insanity."
01:23:24;01:23:26;"- Well, to me, that's not even cartoon violence, though."
01:23:26;01:23:29;"Honestly, it'd be almost better to have like a anvil drop"
01:23:29;01:23:31;"on somebody's head."
01:23:31;01:23:33;"There's just like something so, almost too real"
01:23:33;01:23:34;"about just like a nail."
01:23:34;01:23:35;"(imitates nail)"
01:23:35;01:23:36;"- The sound effect."
01:23:36;01:23:38;"- Yeah, just being like eight, being like."
01:23:38;01:23:40;"- What year is that movie?"
01:23:40;01:23:42;"- '90, '91, I think."
01:23:42;01:23:43;"- What a weird period for Pesci,"
01:23:43;01:23:46;"'cause he's doing Goodfellas."
01:23:46;01:23:48;"- Oh yeah, this is very soon after Goodfellas."
01:23:48;01:23:48;"- He is 90."
01:23:48;01:23:51;"- Yeah, Home Alone also 1990."
01:23:51;01:23:54;"- Wow, so he does Goodfellas and Home Alone in '90."
01:23:54;01:23:56;"Dude, Pesci is crushing it."
01:23:56;01:23:59;"- Two of the most violent films of that era."
01:23:59;01:24:00;"(laughing)"
01:24:00;01:24:03;"The number five song on the billboard charts"
01:24:03;01:24:04;"at the end of the year."
01:24:04;01:24:04;"- Yep."
01:24:04;01:24:07;"- Our good friend Post Malone, Rockstar."
01:24:07;01:24:08;"- That was 2018?"
01:24:08;01:24:09;"- Well."
01:24:09;01:24:10;"- I thought it was last year."
01:24:10;01:24:11;"- It could have come out last year, you know,"
01:24:11;01:24:14;"sometime maybe really hit its stride this year."
01:24:14;01:24:18;"Definitely got a lot of airplay this year."
01:24:20;01:24:26;"Yeah, it did come out in 2017, you're right."
01:24:31;01:24:35;"My brother was telling me, I don't know what festival it was"
01:24:35;01:24:39;"but I guess he was there, maybe projectors were playing,"
01:24:39;01:24:42;"but Fleet Foxes played a set,"
01:24:42;01:24:45;"and front row, knowing every single word, Post Malone."
01:24:45;01:24:48;"- You know, it's funny, I knew that he was a fan."
01:24:48;01:24:49;"- Of Fleet Foxes."
01:24:49;01:24:50;"- He's also a big Vampire Weekend fan,"
01:24:50;01:24:53;"and he hit me up once when we were on tour in Japan,"
01:24:53;01:24:55;"and me and Ariel went and hung out with him."
01:24:55;01:24:56;"I remember we were talking about music,"
01:24:56;01:24:57;"and I was like, ""What else are you into?"""
01:24:57;01:25:00;"And he was like, ""(beep) love Fleet Foxes."""
01:25:00;01:25:01;"- Best type."
01:25:01;01:25:02;"- Great guy."
01:25:02;01:25:04;"- Was that 2018 you hung out?"
01:25:04;01:25:05;"Like on your last trip to Japan?"
01:25:05;01:25:07;"- Oh yeah, that was this past summer."
01:25:07;01:25:08;"- Dude, burying the lead."
01:25:08;01:25:10;"- I think he's a real sweetheart."
01:25:10;01:25:12;"That's still the deal, I love Post Malone."
01:25:12;01:25:14;"- Did you talk designated survivor with him?"
01:25:14;01:25:15;"- No, wait, was he a designated survivor?"
01:25:15;01:25:17;"- Yeah, man, that was just getting started on the show."
01:25:17;01:25:19;"- Oh, I forgot that."
01:25:21;01:25:28;"- Somewhere, Ariel has it on his phone,"
01:25:28;01:25:30;"he took us out with his crew to do karaoke."
01:25:30;01:25:31;"- Oh wow."
01:25:31;01:25:32;"- We had a private karaoke bar,"
01:25:32;01:25:37;"so somewhere there's footage of me and Post singing"
01:25:37;01:25:39;"Where's My Mind by the Pixies."
01:25:39;01:25:40;"- Wow."
01:25:40;01:25:41;"- I think that was his choice,"
01:25:41;01:25:44;"and then I chose Chop Suey by System of a Down."
01:25:44;01:25:45;"And so somewhere there's just like us yelling"
01:25:45;01:25:47;"at like 2 a.m. in Tokyo,"
01:25:47;01:25:49;"""Wake up, grab a little bit of makeup."""
01:25:49;01:25:51;"- Wow, I wouldn't have known that one."
01:25:51;01:25:53;"- I'll save that for the box set."
01:25:53;01:25:54;"- Nice."
01:25:54;01:25:56;"- The number four Christmas song of all time,"
01:25:56;01:25:57;"Last Christmas by Whamp."
01:25:59;01:26:01;"- I don't know if I know this."
01:26:01;01:26:01;"- Oh, you know it."
01:26:01;01:26:06;"George Michael is such a good songwriter."
01:26:06;01:26:12;"Also, like he really did his thing,"
01:26:12;01:26:13;"it's like kind of a,"
01:26:13;01:26:16;"could have been just like a throwaway Wham Christmas song."
01:26:16;01:26:16;"- Yeah."
01:26:16;01:26:19;"♪ Last Christmas I gave you my heart ♪"
01:26:19;01:26:24;"♪ But the very next day you gave it away ♪"
01:26:24;01:26:26;"♪ This year ♪"
01:26:26;01:26:28;"♪ To save me from tears ♪"
01:26:28;01:26:33;"♪ I'll give it to someone special ♪"
01:26:33;01:26:37;"♪ Last Christmas I gave you my heart ♪"
01:26:37;01:26:42;"♪ But the very next day you gave it away ♪"
01:26:42;01:26:44;"♪ This year ♪"
01:26:44;01:26:44;"♪ To save me from tears ♪"
01:26:44;01:26:47;"- Do you think this music has like an inherently"
01:26:47;01:26:48;"like Christmas feel,"
01:26:48;01:26:52;"or just, couldn't he have written just other lyrics to this?"
01:26:52;01:26:53;"- Oh, now there's the Christmas."
01:26:53;01:26:54;"- There's the sleigh bells."
01:26:54;01:26:57;"- Without that, it could have just been a good Wham song."
01:26:57;01:26:58;"- Yeah."
01:26:58;01:27:00;"♪ Last Christmas ♪"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"- One thing I'll say about it is,"
01:27:02;01:27:03;"it's an interesting take on a Christmas song."
01:27:03;01:27:05;"""Last Christmas I gave you my heart,"
01:27:05;01:27:08;"but the very next day, December 26th."""
01:27:08;01:27:09;"- Boxing day."
01:27:09;01:27:10;"- On boxing day, you threw,"
01:27:10;01:27:12;"wait, it's December 26th, boxing day?"
01:27:12;01:27:14;"- I think it is, yeah."
01:27:14;01:27:15;"- Oh yeah, in Canada."
01:27:15;01:27:16;"- Oh, it's a big deal."
01:27:16;01:27:17;"- It's a big deal."
01:27:17;01:27:18;"- What is that?"
01:27:18;01:27:20;"- It's a day when everything goes on sale,"
01:27:20;01:27:23;"so all the stores are selling all their unsold items"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"at like 50%."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"- Oh, that's the same as in America,"
01:27:25;01:27:27;"it's not called boxing day."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"- I guess it's an English thing, right?"
01:27:28;01:27:30;"- I think so, do you call it anything here?"
01:27:30;01:27:31;"- No."
01:27:31;01:27:32;"- It's called boxing day."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"- Wait, no, but nobody actually--"
01:27:33;01:27:34;"- No."
01:27:34;01:27:36;"- It's unboxing day."
01:27:36;01:27:37;"- Yeah."
01:27:37;01:27:37;"- It's when you--"
01:27:37;01:27:39;"- It seems so depressing to go back to all those stores"
01:27:39;01:27:41;"the day after Christmas."
01:27:41;01:27:44;"- Unboxing day is the day when Americans raid the fridge,"
01:27:44;01:27:47;"see if there's any glazed ham left."
01:27:47;01:27:49;"- Gross."
01:27:49;01:27:51;"- Eat some cold and gather the family around the laptop"
01:27:51;01:27:53;"to take down a few unboxing videos."
01:27:53;01:27:56;"So anyway, George Michael is saying"
01:27:56;01:27:57;"that last Christmas I gave you my heart,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"but then on boxing day you threw it away."
01:27:59;01:28:03;"What's the first scenario that comes to mind on Christmas?"
01:28:03;01:28:05;"So is this, you brought your significant other"
01:28:05;01:28:08;"to the family event and they were like, oh yeah, sure."
01:28:08;01:28:10;"Sure, Jake, I'll roll with you to Connecticut."
01:28:10;01:28:12;"And then you get there and you were like, oh, awesome."
01:28:12;01:28:14;"And you were like, I guess things are getting"
01:28:14;01:28:15;"pretty serious between us."
01:28:15;01:28:18;"And then you introduce the family."
01:28:18;01:28:20;"This is in a different universe where you're not married"
01:28:20;01:28:22;"and you still have a lot of family in Connecticut."
01:28:22;01:28:24;"And then you introduce everybody--"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"- And I'm interested in you sexually."
01:28:25;01:28:26;"- What?"
01:28:26;01:28:27;"Oh, it's not me."
01:28:27;01:28:29;"- Oh, I thought it was literally you."
01:28:29;01:28:30;"- Oh, no, no."
01:28:30;01:28:32;"- In this, I'm picturing in this cool TC."
01:28:32;01:28:35;"- In my world, this world, you still date women."
01:28:35;01:28:37;"I don't wanna have too much fun with it,"
01:28:37;01:28:41;"but I want this to be some, you know, closer to real life."
01:28:41;01:28:44;"So this is back in the day, you're dating a woman."
01:28:44;01:28:46;"Maybe you guys live in New York City."
01:28:46;01:28:46;"- Right."
01:28:46;01:28:48;"- And here's the thing, she's from Hawaii."
01:28:48;01:28:49;"I just wanna also--"
01:28:49;01:28:51;"- So it's far to go home."
01:28:51;01:28:53;"- It's far for her to go home and you're like,"
01:28:53;01:28:56;"well, Karen, do you wanna come to my family's"
01:28:56;01:28:59;"rustic New England Christmas?"
01:28:59;01:29:00;"- Farmhouse?"
01:29:00;01:29:02;"- In Farmhouse in Connecticut?"
01:29:02;01:29:04;"Jake, that sounds amazing, sick."
01:29:04;01:29:06;"And then you introduce her to everybody,"
01:29:06;01:29:10;"the whole family's there, little brother Dave."
01:29:10;01:29:11;"Dave's 14 at the time."
01:29:11;01:29:12;"- Oh, I like this."
01:29:12;01:29:14;"- Grandma, grandpa, everybody's there."
01:29:14;01:29:16;"And you say, hey guys, this is Karen, my girlfriend."
01:29:16;01:29:18;"But everybody's, oh, Karen, so great to have you here."
01:29:18;01:29:19;"Oh, welcome to the family."
01:29:19;01:29:21;"We even got you a stocking."
01:29:21;01:29:23;"Maybe, I don't know, your parents are conservative,"
01:29:23;01:29:24;"so they're kinda like, you guys gotta sleep"
01:29:24;01:29:25;"in different rooms."
01:29:25;01:29:27;"And you're like, oh, and she's like, okay."
01:29:27;01:29:29;"And then the next day, you're like, oh, sorry about that."
01:29:29;01:29:31;"That was kinda weird, they made us sleep in different rooms."
01:29:31;01:29:33;"And then Karen's like, no, that's fine."
01:29:33;01:29:36;"And you're like, oh, yeah, no, it's fine."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"But it would've been cooler if we did sleep together."
01:29:39;01:29:39;"And she's like, well, you know, Jake,"
01:29:39;01:29:41;"I did wanna mention something to you."
01:29:41;01:29:43;"You introduced me to your 14-year-old--"
01:29:43;01:29:46;"- This is such a elaborate message."
01:29:46;01:29:49;"So we have not actually been dating."
01:29:49;01:29:51;"This is someone I want to date."
01:29:51;01:29:53;"And then I'm thinking it's a date."
01:29:53;01:29:54;"- You thought you were dating."
01:29:54;01:29:55;"- That we're just friends."
01:29:55;01:29:58;"- You guys have been hooking up for a few months."
01:29:58;01:29:58;"- We have been?"
01:29:58;01:30:00;"- Yeah. - That's confirmed."
01:30:00;01:30:01;"- Yes, you guys-- - There's been physical--"
01:30:01;01:30:04;"- You guys have been hooking up for a few months."
01:30:04;01:30:05;"- Okay. - See, I'm not saying"
01:30:05;01:30:06;"you're not being a psychopath here."
01:30:06;01:30:08;"- Okay, okay, okay, okay."
01:30:08;01:30:09;"- It's just a classic thing, where she's like,"
01:30:09;01:30:12;"okay, well, Jake, you know, when I know we've been"
01:30:12;01:30:14;"casually having sex for a few months?"
01:30:14;01:30:16;"And you're like, well, I wouldn't say casually."
01:30:16;01:30:20;"Okay, but I guess when I, being here at this"
01:30:20;01:30:25;"gorgeous, rustic farmhouse in Connecticut on Christmas,"
01:30:25;01:30:27;"and when I heard you introduce me"
01:30:27;01:30:28;"to your 14-year-old brother Dave,"
01:30:28;01:30:31;"and grandma and grandpa, and you said girlfriend,"
01:30:31;01:30:33;"I guess something kind of clicked for me in that moment."
01:30:33;01:30:35;"You're like, me too, babe."
01:30:35;01:30:36;"She's like, well, in a different way."
01:30:36;01:30:39;"I guess I realized that I don't want to date."
01:30:39;01:30:42;"And you're like, oh. - You accepted my invitation."
01:30:42;01:30:44;"- Yeah, and then Jake's getting heated."
01:30:44;01:30:47;"You accepted my invitation to this rustic farmhouse?"
01:30:47;01:30:50;"And she's like, I thought you were just being cool, Jake."
01:30:50;01:30:52;"Obviously, my family lives in Hawaii."
01:30:52;01:30:54;"I can't afford to go fly back and forth."
01:30:54;01:30:56;"I was just there for Thanksgiving."
01:30:56;01:30:58;"I thought you were just being cool by inviting me."
01:30:58;01:30:59;"- I was being cool."
01:30:59;01:31:01;"I invited you to my parents' house."
01:31:01;01:31:02;"- Now you're really harshing me out."
01:31:02;01:31:04;"I thought that was because we were friends."
01:31:04;01:31:06;"- What did you think this was?"
01:31:06;01:31:08;"- I thought we were casually having sex,"
01:31:08;01:31:10;"and we were just gonna have a fun, rustic weekend."
01:31:10;01:31:12;"- My grandparents are there."
01:31:12;01:31:13;"- That's on you, man."
01:31:13;01:31:15;"- How am I supposed to introduce you?"
01:31:15;01:31:17;"This is Karen, someone I'm casually having sex with?"
01:31:17;01:31:19;"- No, man. - I told you."
01:31:19;01:31:21;"- No, Jake, you just say this is my friend, Karen."
01:31:21;01:31:22;"That's our business."
01:31:22;01:31:24;"Okay, you know what, I feel really uncomfortable."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"Will you drive me to the train station?"
01:31:26;01:31:27;"- Gladly."
01:31:27;01:31:30;"- No, I have to explain everything."

01:51:38;01:51:40;"That's pretty good."
01:51:40;01:51:41;"- How does it go?"
01:51:41;01:51:42;"- She said, do you love me?"
01:51:42;01:51:44;"I tell her only partly."
01:51:44;01:51:47;"I only love my bed, my mama, I'm sorry."
01:51:47;01:51:50;"He wrote that lyric down as a filler"
01:51:50;01:51:52;"and then he was like, eh, it's fine."
01:51:52;01:51:54;"- And then it turned out to be the biggest."
01:51:54;01:51:55;"People really related to it."
01:51:55;01:51:57;"Some people thought that he was secretly,"
01:51:57;01:51:59;"remember there was this like conspiracy theory"
01:51:59;01:52:02;"that his son's middle name was my bed?"
01:52:02;01:52:06;"Well, Nick just got a text from Hannah saying,"
01:52:06;01:52:07;"I can't believe Jake doesn't know"
01:52:07;01:52:10;"the Mariah Carey Christmas song."
01:52:10;01:52:12;"- And it goes, OMG Jake,"
01:52:12;01:52:15;"we've definitely listened to that song together."
01:52:15;01:52:15;"- Wow, okay."
01:52:15;01:52:16;"- That's not true."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"- What does that even mean together?"
01:52:18;01:52:18;"What are we sitting there listening"
01:52:18;01:52:20;"to Christmas music together?"
01:52:20;01:52:21;"- Maybe you took her back to a rustic farmhouse"
01:52:21;01:52:23;"in Connecticut, introduced her to the family"
01:52:23;01:52:25;"and she played it."
01:52:25;01:52:26;"- I'm saying I don't buy that."
01:52:26;01:52:28;"- Incorrect, ma'am."
01:52:28;01:52:30;"Strong disagree, that never happened."
01:52:30;01:52:32;"- We've definitely listened to it together."
01:52:32;01:52:33;"I'm saying I don't buy that."
01:52:33;01:52:35;"When?"
01:52:35;01:52:36;"But she seems shocked."
01:52:36;01:52:38;"I'm getting an OMG."
01:52:38;01:52:39;"- No, I'm telling you,"
01:52:39;01:52:41;"this is the biggest shocker in TC history"
01:52:41;01:52:43;"that you're not familiar with that song."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"- I mean, when it kicked in, I was like,"
01:52:45;01:52:47;"okay, I've heard this in my life."
01:52:47;01:52:48;"- Okay."
01:52:48;01:52:52;"- But I never internalized it as a major work by Mariah."
01:52:52;01:52:53;"- Even now that you've listened to part of it,"
01:52:53;01:52:55;"could you sing back part of it?"
01:52:55;01:52:56;"- Not really."
01:52:56;01:53:00;"♪ I don't want no Christmas ♪"
01:53:00;01:53:01;"- Yeah, what happens after that?"
01:53:01;01:53:05;"♪ Da da da, no light for Christmas ♪"
01:53:05;01:53:06;"What note does it go to?"
01:53:06;01:53:08;"♪ Da da da da ♪"
01:53:08;01:53:12;"♪ I don't want a light for Christmas ♪"
01:53:12;01:53:14;"No, it goes up."
01:53:14;01:53:18;"♪ I don't want a light for Christmas ♪"
01:53:18;01:53:19;"I don't know what it is."
01:53:19;01:53:19;"- That was close."
01:53:19;01:53:20;"- I'll do the same note."
01:53:20;01:53:22;"♪ I don't want a light for Christmas ♪"
01:53:22;01:53:25;"♪ There is just one thing I need ♪"
01:53:25;01:53:26;"♪ And I ♪"
01:53:26;01:53:27;"Don't know it."
01:53:27;01:53:28;"♪ Ba na na ♪"
01:53:28;01:53:31;"- This is like not knowing a letter of the alphabet"
01:53:31;01:53:32;"or something, Jake."
01:53:32;01:53:35;"This is so, this is deep."
01:53:35;01:53:36;"- I know, I mean."
01:53:36;01:53:40;"- It's also, I think it's a song that truly"
01:53:40;01:53:42;"everybody in America would recognize"
01:53:42;01:53:47;"regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, age."
01:53:47;01:53:50;"- Age, I think you're wrong."
01:53:50;01:53:51;"- Okay, I might be wrong about that,"
01:53:51;01:53:53;"but you're the right age to know it."
01:53:53;01:53:56;"- No, yeah, I'm saying most people my age do know it."
01:53:56;01:53:57;"- Right."
01:53:57;01:54:00;"- I would bet most 70 year olds do not know that song."
01:54:00;01:54:02;"Granted, I'm 41."
01:54:02;01:54:03;"I'm not close to 70."
01:54:03;01:54:07;"- I would guess at least 50% of 70 year olds know it."
01:54:07;01:54:08;"- I actually think it's kind of beautiful"
01:54:08;01:54:09;"that you don't know it."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"I don't mean that in a condescending way."
01:54:11;01:54:12;"It's just very pure."
01:54:12;01:54:15;"You know, not every single aspect of popular culture"
01:54:15;01:54:17;"has infiltrated you."
01:54:17;01:54:17;"You still have."
01:54:17;01:54:18;"- It's true."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"- I don't know, I mean, I like Mariah too."
01:54:20;01:54:23;"I just, I think maybe I've heard it in a CVS"
01:54:23;01:54:26;"and I've been like, oh, this is her Christmas song."
01:54:26;01:54:27;"It's like not very good."
01:54:27;01:54:28;"- No, I agree."
01:54:28;01:54:30;"There is something cool about the fact"
01:54:30;01:54:31;"that you don't know this song."
01:54:31;01:54:32;"It's just truly shocking."
01:54:32;01:54:33;"- Wow."
01:54:33;01:54:35;"- Hannah added that it quote, ""Makes me love him more."""
01:54:35;01:54:36;"- Oh."
01:54:36;01:54:37;"- Really?"
01:54:37;01:54:38;"She wrote that?"
01:54:38;01:54:39;"- With an exclamation point, yeah."
01:54:39;01:54:40;"- That's crazy."
01:54:40;01:54:41;"That's hilarious."
01:54:41;01:54:42;"- This is like when you find out"
01:54:42;01:54:43;"someone's not on Facebook."
01:54:43;01:54:45;"It just makes you kind of respect them a little bit."
01:54:45;01:54:46;"- I'm not on Facebook."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"- There you go."
01:54:47;01:54:51;"- Seinfeld, get off of Facebook."
01:54:51;01:54:52;"What are you still doing on Facebook?"
01:54:52;01:54:54;"- Ah, can't leave."
01:54:54;01:54:55;"- Yeah, you can't leave."
01:54:55;01:54:57;"- Wait, is there a Seinfeld 2000 Facebook account?"
01:54:57;01:55:00;"- There is, but I abandoned it about two years ago."
01:55:00;01:55:02;"- Yeah, wait, so it's your personal page?"
01:55:02;01:55:03;"- I was trying to be everywhere."
01:55:03;01:55:06;"There is a Seinfeld, it's got like 70,000 followers."
01:55:06;01:55:07;"- Oh, that's pretty good actually."
01:55:07;01:55:10;"- Yeah, I just, to repost the same content"
01:55:10;01:55:12;"on three different platforms,"
01:55:12;01:55:14;"and I just wasn't feeling it."
01:55:14;01:55:15;"- Yeah, you gotta get some employees maybe."
01:55:15;01:55:17;"- Facebook is beyond weak."
01:55:17;01:55:18;"- Yeah."
01:55:18;01:55:19;"- It's definitely."
01:55:19;01:55:20;"- It's toxic."
01:55:20;01:55:22;"- They're all pretty bad, but yeah."
01:55:22;01:55:24;"All right guys, well that was a hell of a 2018."
01:55:24;01:55:25;"Thanks to--"
01:55:25;01:55:28;"(laughing)"
01:55:28;01:55:31;"- Unnecessary Facebook tangent."
01:55:31;01:55:32;"Make sure you keep that in the edit guys."
01:55:32;01:55:35;"- Thanks to Chris Bayo for coming through"
01:55:35;01:55:37;"and trying the Target Hot Sauce Challenge,"
01:55:37;01:55:39;"as well as the Carolina Reaper Challenge."
01:55:39;01:55:42;"And thanks to everybody who's been listening all year."
01:55:42;01:55:44;"2018's been a hell of a year for Time Crisis."
01:55:44;01:55:47;"We've had Andrew Smith, creator of Joker Man."
01:55:47;01:55:48;"We've had--"
01:55:48;01:55:49;"- T-Pain."
01:55:49;01:55:51;"- T-Pain, that was this year?"
01:55:51;01:55:52;"- That was, yeah."
01:55:52;01:55:53;"- Wow."
01:55:53;01:55:54;"It's definitely been a hell of a year."
01:55:54;01:55:56;"The TC community's grown."
01:55:56;01:55:57;"- Exponentially."
01:55:57;01:55:59;"- Yeah, exponentially."
01:55:59;01:56:00;"It's out of control."
01:56:00;01:56:03;"All right everybody, we'll see you in 2019."
01:56:03;01:56:04;"- Peace."
01:56:04;01:56:07;"- Time Crisis with Ezra King."
