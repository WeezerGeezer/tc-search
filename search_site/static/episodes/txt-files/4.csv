00:00;00:02;"Beats 1."
00:02;00:09;"It's Time Crisis 4. Time Crisis Quatro. Can you believe it? We're already on our fourth episode? Time flies when you're having fun."
00:09;00:16;"This week's a little sad because I'm stuck out in LA, so I have to say goodbye to my New York friends, Despot and Cousin Asher."
00:16;00:24;"However, I'm very blessed to have painter Jake Longstreth teaching us about the Eagles, Twitter user ElectroLemon teaching us about Twitter,"
00:24;00:29;"and the multi-talented legendary entertainer Jamie Foxx counting down the top 5 iTunes songs."
00:30;00:35;"This is Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig."
00:35;00:37;"[Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig]"
03:15;03:19;"That was ""Father"" with ""Please Stop Making Fake Versace."""
03:19;03:21;"Welcome back to ""Time Crisis,"" everybody."
03:21;03:25;"This is episode four, still in Los Angeles."
03:25;03:27;"I haven't been able to get out."
03:27;03:30;"That means that Deathspot and Cousin Asher can't be with us,"
03:30;03:32;"but we're very lucky for the second week in a row"
03:32;03:37;"to have painter Jake Longstreth in the building."
03:37;03:38;"Nice to be back."
03:38;03:40;"We're very happy to have you back."
03:40;03:44;"We got an incredible response to you on the last show."
03:44;03:47;"You're teaching the youth all about ""Grateful Dead."""
03:47;03:50;"We actually got a lot of kids on Twitter saying that stuff along the lines of,"
03:50;03:53;"like, ""I'm young, and I don't think 'The Grateful Dead' is trash."""
03:53;03:54;"-Are you serious? -Yeah."
03:54;03:55;"Wow."
03:55;03:57;"I think the tide might be turning."
03:57;04:00;"I thought that was always a contentious stance you were taking to begin with,"
04:00;04:04;"that they were trash, or that you would perceive the youth to think that they were trash."
04:04;04:08;"But, I mean, that's what happens. It's just the cycle of culture."
04:08;04:10;"Your parents like something, then the kids think it's trash,"
04:10;04:12;"and then eventually the kids think it's cool."
04:12;04:13;"Right."
04:13;04:17;"So what have you been up to the past two weeks?"
04:17;04:19;"Let's see here. I was in Vegas last weekend."
04:19;04:21;"Why were you in Vegas?"
04:21;04:24;"I was there for the Las Vegas Film Festival with my girlfriend,"
04:24;04:29;"and we were staying in this hotel in the sort of old part of town."
04:29;04:33;"And across the street, there was this place called the Heart Attack Grill."
04:33;04:34;"-Have you heard of this? -No."
04:34;04:36;"It's a small chain, apparently."
04:36;04:37;"Yeah."
04:37;04:41;"And it's like a libertarian burger chain."
04:41;04:44;"And on the outside of the building, in huge red neon,"
04:44;04:48;"it says, ""Over 350 pounds. Eats for free."""
04:48;04:51;"And there's a huge scale on the outside of the building,"
04:51;04:56;"and there's a flat screen monitor mounted above the scale with this loop."
04:56;04:59;"This really sounds like you're making this up."
04:59;05:00;"No, no, no. I'm serious."
05:00;05:04;"This sounds like it's from, like, Idiocracy or, like, Tim and Eric."
05:04;05:05;"Yeah."
05:05;05:10;"Wait, but what makes it-- is there a connection between libertarianism and being overweight?"
05:10;05:12;"No, no, no. Well, here's the thing."
05:12;05:16;"So all over the outside of this building, there were quotes from the founder of the restaurant."
05:16;05:17;"Right."
05:17;05:21;"It said, ""We don't want every town in this country to turn into another San Francisco."
05:21;05:25;"Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the caloric intake of adults"
05:25;05:28;"should be regulated and mandated by the government."
05:28;05:34;"This food is unabashedly terrible for you, and it's dangerous for you."""
05:34;05:37;"-Oh, okay. -But we have the freedom to eat this food."
05:37;05:40;"The staff of the restaurant wears medical scrubs."
05:40;05:43;"Yeah. Oh, because it's the Heart Attack Grill?"
05:43;05:46;"Yeah, and if you're a customer there, you put on this, like, bib"
05:46;05:48;"and it's actually just sort of like a hospital gown."
05:48;05:51;"Wow, I have such mixed feelings about all of this."
05:51;05:55;"No, so we walked past this place, like, five times in, like, 115-degree heat."
05:55;05:57;"It was just, like-- it was dark."
05:57;06:03;"I mean, I think it's kind of cool that they maybe are not, like, body-shaming people."
06:03;06:04;"Absolutely."
06:04;06:08;"But at the same time, you shouldn't use other people's bodies for your own political agenda."
06:08;06:09;"Totally true."
06:09;06:16;"I mean, yeah, I mean, there's a part of me that can understand the philosophy,"
06:16;06:20;"but it's just so grotesque that my delicate sensibilities were--"
06:20;06:23;"I'm not going to say offended, but I was depressed."
06:23;06:27;"Yeah, well, Heart Attack Grill. Check it out next time you're in Vegas."
06:27;06:29;"Here's Chicago with ""If You Leave Me Now."""
06:36;06:45;"If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me."
06:45;06:53;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
06:53;07:03;"And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me."
07:03;07:09;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
07:09;07:20;"Ooh, God, I just want you to stay."
07:20;07:28;"Love like ours is love that's hard to find."
07:28;07:38;"How could we let this slip away?"
07:38;07:46;"We've come too far to leave it all behind."
07:46;07:51;"How could we end it all this way?"
07:51;07:58;"When tomorrow comes, we both need to break."
07:58;08:02;"We said to break."
08:28;08:37;"Love like ours is love that's hard to find."
08:37;08:47;"How could we let this slip away?"
08:47;08:55;"We've come too far to leave it all behind."
08:55;09:00;"How could we end it all this way?"
09:00;09:05;"When tomorrow comes, and we both need to break."
09:05;09:11;"The things we said today."
09:11;09:21;"If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me."
09:21;09:35;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
09:35;09:48;"Ooh, God, what's got to have you by my side?"
09:48;10:02;"Ooh, no, baby, please don't go."
10:02;10:06;"Ooh, mama, I just got to have your love."
10:32;10:39;"I was dreaming of the past."
10:39;10:48;"And my heart was beating fast."
10:48;10:56;"I began to lose control."
11:04;11:12;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
11:12;11:20;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
11:20;11:27;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, I didn't."
11:27;11:33;"I'm just a jealous guy."
11:33;11:41;"Now I was feeling insecure."
11:41;11:49;"You might not want me anymore."
11:49;11:57;"I was trembling inside."
11:57;12:04;"I was trembling inside."
12:04;12:12;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
12:12;12:20;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
12:20;12:28;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
12:28;12:33;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:02;13:13;"I didn't mean to hurt you, no, no."
13:13;13:20;"And I'm sorry I made you cry."
13:20;13:28;"Oh, I didn't want to hurt you, no, no."
13:28;13:34;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:40;13:43;"I'm just a jealous guy."
13:43;13:46;"Yes, I am."
13:46;13:51;"I'm just a jealous guy, yeah."
13:51;13:57;"And I wasn't gonna fight it looking at you."
13:57;14:01;"'Cause I'm a jealous kind of fella."
14:01;14:03;"Yeah."
14:32;14:35;"Yeah, I'm a jealous guy."
14:35;14:37;"Yes, I am."
14:37;14:38;"I'm a jealous guy."
14:38;14:40;"Yes, I am."
15:05;15:13;"You're listening to Time Crisis with Ezra Koenig on Beats 1."
15:13;15:16;"That was Donny Hathaway covering John Lennon's Jealous Guy,"
15:16;15:18;"live at the Bitter End, 1971."
15:18;15:19;"You familiar with that cover, Jake?"
15:19;15:20;"Yeah, I love that."
15:20;15:21;"It's beautiful."
15:21;15:25;"And so that, is that like the same year that the original song came out?"
15:25;15:29;"I think more or less, yeah, at most a year later."
15:29;15:32;"I love when people do that."
15:32;15:34;"And I feel like that was a more common thing back then,"
15:34;15:37;"to just turn around, like hear a new song,"
15:37;15:39;"and then turn around and completely reinterpret it."
15:39;15:43;"Well, you'd be surprised, a lot of people are doing that on YouTube these days."
15:43;15:45;"And Vine."
15:45;15:52;"I mean, like fans, like amateur hour, or are we talking about like prominent artists?"
15:52;15:55;"You definitely have a lot of fans who like the day a song comes out"
15:55;15:59;"would be like the first person doing the acoustic cover on YouTube."
15:59;16:02;"But you also have, I don't know, I feel like there's also,"
16:02;16:09;"because there's such a hunger for content in the modern digital global marketplace,"
16:09;16:10;"that you will have more covers."
16:10;16:13;"I feel like in Vampire Weekend, we're always asked to do covers."
16:13;16:16;"You ever heard the Jimi Hendrix playing Sgt. Pepper?"
16:16;16:17;"Yeah, oh yeah."
16:17;16:19;"And that was like the week that album came out."
16:19;16:21;"Exactly, that's the lore."
16:21;16:25;"Right, so Hendrix was just like playing a show in London,"
16:25;16:28;"this album drops, and he's just like, ""I'm just going to cover this song."""
16:28;16:30;"Yeah, like the next day."
16:30;16:34;"I think I read that Taylor Swift covered ""Trap Queen."""
16:34;16:36;"What's that song?"
16:36;16:42;"""Trap Queen"" is a gargantuan hit this year, New Jersey rapper Fetty Wap."
16:42;16:46;"She either brought him out on stage where they covered the song together, I don't know."
16:46;16:47;"Covered?"
16:47;16:49;"Maybe she just watched him sing it."
16:49;16:51;"And did she sing the hook or something?"
16:51;16:52;"You know, that's unclear."
16:52;16:56;"Maybe she brought him out and he sang it and she watched him sing it."
16:56;17:02;"I still think there's a distinction from what we're talking about with kids doing covers on YouTube"
17:02;17:05;"and then that cover we just heard of ""Jealous Guy."""
17:05;17:07;"Yeah, I know what you mean."
17:07;17:10;"I was kind of putting a playlist together for today,"
17:10;17:15;"and I was thinking that I was going to keep it a little bit rock,"
17:15;17:18;"because later you're going to teach us about the Eagles."
17:18;17:21;"So I was keeping it more on that 60s, 70s tip."
17:21;17:23;"I was actually thinking about Jimi Hendrix,"
17:23;17:28;"because sometimes it feels like the modern world doesn't really care about Jimi Hendrix."
17:28;17:31;"He's almost like Che Guevara."
17:31;17:32;"You know what I mean?"
17:32;17:34;"Like dorm room posters?"
17:34;17:37;"Like the same way that Che Guevara has just become a dorm room poster,"
17:37;17:42;"and a lot of people are more familiar with the poster than, say, with his politics."
17:42;17:45;"I think there's a similar disconnect with Hendrix and the music."
17:45;17:47;"I think you're right."
17:47;17:52;"Hendrix--I mean, I guess from my vantage point, Hendrix, his main thing was"
17:52;17:55;"what an incredible guitar player he was."
17:55;18:01;"And he wrote some amazing songs, but I don't think of him primarily as a terrific songwriter."
18:01;18:07;"And maybe with the guitar being sort of out of fashion or out of favor or just very hard to do--"
18:07;18:09;"Yeah, no, it's out of fashion."
18:09;18:11;"Okay, confirmed. It's out of fashion."
18:11;18:13;"But his image is so cool."
18:13;18:16;"No, of course, because he's had an amazing style."
18:16;18:20;"He was a born performer, and he did write some good songs."
18:20;18:23;"I was going to play ""Bold is Love."""
18:23;18:26;"Let's see what the world thinks of Jimi Hendrix in 2015, ""Bold is Love."""
18:26;18:33;"Anger, he smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armor"
18:33;18:37;"Queen jealousy, he waits behind him"
18:37;18:42;"Her fiery green gown slayers at the grassy ground"
18:42;18:46;"Who all the life-giving waters take for granted"
18:46;18:48;"They quietly understand"
18:48;18:52;"Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready"
18:52;18:56;"But wonder why the fight is on"
18:56;19:03;"But they're all bold is love"
19:03;19:10;"They're all bold is love"
19:10;19:13;"They're all bold is love"
19:13;19:21;"Just ask the answers"
19:21;19:29;"My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria"
19:29;19:35;"Orange is young, full of daring but very unsteady for the first go-round"
19:35;19:42;"My yellow in this case is not so mellow, in fact, I'm trying to say it's frightening like me"
19:42;19:49;"And all of these emotions in mind keep tolling me from giving my life to a rainbow like you"
19:49;19:54;"But I'm a, yeah, I'm bold is love"
19:54;19:57;"Yeah, yeah"
19:57;20:02;"Well, I'm bold, bold is love"
20:02;20:06;"I'm bold is love"
20:06;20:11;"Just ask the answers"
20:11;20:13;"He knows everything"
20:13;20:16;"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
20:16;20:43;". . ."

24:42;24:49;". . ."
24:49;25:08;". . ."
25:08;25:12;"That was the Brothers and Sisters with The Times They Are A-Changin'."
25:12;25:17;"That was the album from the '60s. There's like a bunch of gospel covers of Dylan. You ever heard that?"
25:17;25:20;"A little bit. I love that. It's incredible."
25:20;25:24;"Yeah, it really gives the song, it makes the original not sound that good."
25:24;25:31;"To me it's sort of like, it exposes how strong the foundation of that songwriting is."
25:31;25:32;"True."
25:32;25:42;"That you could translate his song into that and it'd sound like some just complete classic from before the rock and roll era."
25:42;25:44;"Right."
25:44;25:46;"You knew what he was doing."
25:46;25:47;"Bob."
25:47;25:49;"Bob. Yeah."
25:49;25:55;"It's very exciting because today we have Jamie Foxx coming in to do the Top 5 with us. Are you familiar with Jamie Foxx?"
25:55;25:56;"Yeah."
25:56;25:58;"Are you familiar with his music?"
25:58;26:01;"No. He's on a Kanye song, right? On the first record?"
26:01;26:07;"Yeah, he's on Slow Jams. He's on the first and the second. He's on Slow Jams on the first and Gold Digger on the second."
26:07;26:08;"Oh, that's him?"
26:08;26:10;"Yeah, he's doing like kind of the Ray Charles."
26:10;26:11;"Oh, wow. That's cool."
26:11;26:18;"Very excited to have him. I was thinking today that he's a true triple threat in 2015, which used to be more common I think in showbiz."
26:18;26:22;"But he's like massive stand-up comedian. I don't think he's gone on tour in a while."
26:22;26:23;"Still? Okay."
26:23;26:24;"No, I mean he could."
26:24;26:25;"Back in the day?"
26:25;26:30;"Not even that long ago. I think he's done, within the past five years, he's done massive arena stand-up tours."
26:30;26:31;"Wow."
26:31;26:36;"Obviously huge actor, Academy Award winning actor. And then a legitimately huge musician too."
26:36;26:40;"That's insane. That's like Sinatra. But Sinatra couldn't do comedy."
26:40;26:41;"Stand-up."
26:41;26:46;"Woe to them that are at ease in Zion."
26:46;26:48;"That seems kind of unprecedented actually."
26:48;26:49;"Yeah, stand-up."
26:49;26:50;"Maybe Steve Martin?"
26:50;26:51;"Yeah."
26:51;26:58;"The previous Triple Crown title holder was Steve Martin and then Jamie Foxx came in and just shit all over him."
26:58;27:03;"But see, yeah, Steve Martin's music sucks. It's like novelty music."
27:03;27:06;"Well, yeah. I mean he can actually shred on banjo."
27:06;27:10;"Yeah, okay. Fair. He's a practitioner for sure."
27:10;27:17;"He's a practitioner. Although banjo is obviously a little bit like guitar. It's like you get these dudes who just kind of learn how to shred on it."
27:17;27:23;"It doesn't exactly have that kind of forward thinking. You're not going to get a number one pop hit."
27:23;27:25;"So is Jamie Foxx writing songs?"
27:25;27:31;"I think he writes, yeah. I mean I'm sure he collaborates with people because he's worked with so many different producers and stuff."
27:31;27:39;"But he's definitely a writer. He plays piano, studied classical music, I was reading today, in college."
27:39;27:48;"And then as I said, his career has been from In Living Color to the Jamie Foxx show, Booty Call, which my dad was a set dresser on."
27:48;27:50;"That was a show he had?"
27:50;27:51;"It was a film."
27:51;27:52;"Oh, okay."
27:52;27:53;"Oh, you never saw Booty Call?"
27:53;27:54;"No."
27:54;27:56;"That's a real classic. It's him and Tommy Davidson."
27:56;28:00;"Then all like the huge movies of the past 15 years and Ray and stuff."
28:00;28:01;"Oh, incredible."
28:01;28:04;"Yeah, incredible. So we're very blessed to have him in the studio."
28:04;28:07;"But before he gets here, I want to play some of his music."
28:07;28:13;"My personal favorite, he's done a lot of music, my personal favorite Jamie Foxx song is Extravaganza."
28:13;28:17;"I believe this was on his first album and I love this. I love the lyrics to it."
28:17;28:22;"It's all about one crazy night and basically the hook is, ""It was a one night extravaganza."""
28:22;28:25;"So here's Jamie Foxx with Extravaganza."
28:43;28:48;"Last night me and my dogs were hanging out"
28:48;28:53;"Tired of being cramped up in the house"
28:53;28:58;"We were simply celebrating life"
28:58;29:03;"Off from work today so it's alright"
29:03;29:08;"But all those up and downs had me in a twist"
29:08;29:12;"Started dancing with this model chick"
29:12;29:17;"Then every record became my favorite song"
29:17;29:21;"And that is all that I remember"
29:21;29:26;"I had one too many drinks"
29:26;29:31;"And ended up at the embassy"
29:31;29:36;"With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee"
29:36;29:41;"It was a one night extravaganza"
29:41;29:46;"When I woke up from last night's savagery"
29:46;29:50;"Baby girl was laying next to me"
29:50;29:55;"Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere"
29:55;30:00;"I got dressed and got up out of there"
30:00;30:05;"But not before I called for me a cab"
30:05;30:10;"Hungover from all the drinks I had"
30:10;30:15;"And now I'm telling my story to you"
30:15;30:19;"Everything that I remember"
30:19;30:24;"I had one too many drinks"
30:24;30:29;"And ended up at the embassy"
30:29;30:34;"With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee"
30:34;30:38;"It was a one night extravaganza"
30:38;30:43;"I had one too many drinks"
30:43;30:48;"And ended up at the embassy"
30:48;30:53;"With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee"
30:53;30:58;"It was a one night extravaganza"
30:58;31:03;"Extra, extravaganza"
31:03;31:08;"Oh it was an extravaganza"
31:08;31:13;"Guess it was the things that I remember"
31:13;31:18;"And I remember being at the bar"
31:18;31:21;"Trying to ask what that hipno hit for"
31:21;31:24;"Knowing I can't afford to get more"
31:24;31:26;"Here's a broke n***a in trick by"
31:26;31:28;"One bottle and sip slow"
31:28;31:30;"Or leave the club now"
31:30;31:31;"Do like I did"
31:31;31:33;"Come back when you get dough"
31:33;31:34;"A fish stick n***a"
31:34;31:35;"Now we messing with lobster"
31:35;31:36;"We messing with Grammys"
31:36;31:37;"We messing with Oscars"
31:37;31:39;"You messing with that dranky drank"
31:39;31:41;"Plus you puffing on the stanky stank"
31:41;31:42;"I'm a girl with no issues"
31:42;31:43;"I picked the wrong one"
31:43;31:46;"Instead of talking about I ain't like them other girls"
31:46;31:48;"Well tonight I'm trying to find them other girls"
31:48;31:49;"Bring their own rubber girl"
31:49;31:50;"Never meet your mother girl"
31:50;31:52;"You know they love it when you love them"
31:52;31:53;"And they tell their friends girl"
31:53;31:55;"Oh that's right"
31:55;31:59;"I had one too many drinks"
31:59;32:04;"And ended up at the embassy"
32:04;32:09;"With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee"
32:09;32:13;"It was a one night extravaganza"
32:13;32:18;"I had one too many drinks"
32:18;32:23;"And ended up at the embassy"
32:23;32:28;"With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee"
32:28;32:33;"It was a one night extravaganza"
32:33;32:35;"I had one too many drinks"
32:35;32:38;"That was Jamie Foxx with ""Extravaganza"""
32:38;32:42;"We're very excited because Jamie's going to be in the studio with us in person"
32:42;32:45;"A little bit later to count down the iTunes top 5"
32:45;32:48;"But before that happens"
32:48;32:50;"We're going to get into some Eagles"
32:50;32:53;"Jake are you ready to do our little Eagles rundown?"
32:53;32:54;"Sure let's get into it"
32:54;32:55;"Let's get into it"
32:55;32:58;"So I think the first question is"
32:58;33:01;"For a lot of the younger people listening"
33:01;33:04;"Who are the Eagles and why are they important if at all?"
33:04;33:05;"Well okay"
33:05;33:08;"The Eagles are one of the biggest selling artists of all time"
33:08;33:11;"And their greatest hits volume 1 is"
33:11;33:13;"I think tied with Thriller"
33:13;33:16;"For the greatest selling album of all time"
33:16;33:17;"Tied with Thriller"
33:17;33:18;"Yeah"
33:18;33:19;"Okay"
33:19;33:21;"They were a rock and roll band"
33:21;33:25;"Formed in 1970, 71 in Los Angeles"
33:25;33:26;"Okay"
33:26;33:28;"And they disbanded in about 1980"
33:28;33:30;"And they sort of"
33:30;33:31;"I think in a lot of people's minds"
33:31;33:34;"Symbolize and embody the 1970s"
33:34;33:37;"I mean they all met playing in Linda Ronstadt's band"
33:37;33:38;"Right"
33:38;33:40;"Playing gigs at the Troubadour in the late 60s"
33:40;33:42;"So they emerge out of that"
33:42;33:45;"Late 60s Laurel Canyon hippie scene"
33:45;33:47;"Crosby, Stills & Nash, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell"
33:47;33:50;"All those really idiosyncratic great artists"
33:50;33:51;"And the Eagles kind of go"
33:51;33:55;"And write the more sort of straight forward commercial"
33:55;33:58;"Versions of their peers"
33:58;34:00;"Which at the time made them a punchline"
34:00;34:01;"A little bit"
34:01;34:02;"Yeah I mean"
34:02;34:04;"Like in the movie Big Lebowski"
34:04;34:06;"The dude hates the Eagles"
34:06;34:07;"Absolutely"
34:07;34:09;"I feel like there was like a Seinfeld"
34:09;34:12;"Where there was some kind of joke about Desperado"
34:12;34:14;"Oh yeah no, Witchy Woman"
34:14;34:15;"Oh Witchy Woman"
34:15;34:16;"Yeah yeah"
34:16;34:17;"They like hated hearing it on the radio or something"
34:17;34:18;"They're a punchline"
34:18;34:19;"Well this is what's interesting"
34:19;34:20;"So if you think about"
34:20;34:21;"For snarky New York intellectuals"
34:21;34:22;"Right"
34:22;34:24;"The Eagles had a bullseye"
34:24;34:25;"For the tastemakers"
34:25;34:27;"The Eagles have always been a joke"
34:27;34:28;"Right"
34:28;34:30;"And I think it's interesting to think about"
34:30;34:32;"The other really big top selling artists"
34:32;34:36;"Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin, Michael Jackson"
34:36;34:39;"Those artists are not hated in the same way"
34:39;34:41;"That the Eagles are"
34:41;34:43;"I mean people might be indifferent to the Beatles"
34:43;34:44;"Right"
34:44;34:45;"Or love Zeppelin"
34:45;34:46;"But they're not like"
34:46;34:47;"The Beatles suck"
34:47;34:48;"I hate the Beatles"
34:48;34:50;"And I think the Eagles represent"
34:50;34:52;"Some sort of like very middle brow"
34:52;34:56;"Vanilla corporate vision of rock and roll"
34:56;34:59;"Now I don't actually think that's the case"
34:59;35:01;"I'm here to make a case for the Eagles"
35:01;35:03;"I like the Eagles"
35:03;35:04;"But I think that"
35:04;35:06;"To me they're a fascinating band to think about"
35:06;35:08;"Because they are so loved and so hated"
35:08;35:09;"And so mild"
35:09;35:10;"Right"
35:10;35:12;"So let's picture this"
35:12;35:14;"I'm a college senior right now"
35:14;35:15;"I'm 22 years old"
35:15;35:18;"To me the Eagles represent vanilla garbage"
35:18;35:21;"What's the first song you're going to play to me"
35:21;35:22;"To show that that's not the case?"
35:22;35:25;"Let's start with My Man"
35:25;35:28;"Which is a song from '74"
35:28;35:30;"Written by Bernie Ledin"
35:30;35:32;"To his friend Graham Parsons"
35:32;35:34;"Who had just died the year prior"
35:34;35:36;"From a drug overdose"
35:36;35:38;"They wrote this very"
35:38;35:39;"Very touching, very beautiful"
35:39;35:42;"But very saccharine song"
35:42;35:43;"Okay"
35:43;35:44;"But I actually like the song"
35:44;35:46;"I mean it's very affecting"
35:46;35:47;"So this is the Eagles tribute"
35:47;35:48;"To Graham Parsons"
35:48;35:50;"To Graham Parsons, My Man"
35:50;36:09;"guitar solo"
36:09;36:12;"Tell me the truth"
36:12;36:14;"How do you feel"
36:14;36:16;"Like you're rolling so fast"
36:16;36:19;"That you're spinning your wheels"
36:19;36:21;"Don't feel too bad"
36:21;36:24;"You're not all alone"
36:24;36:29;"We're all trying to get along"
36:29;36:31;"With everybody else"
36:31;36:34;"Trying to go their way"
36:34;36:37;"You're bound to get tripped"
36:37;36:39;"And what can you say"
36:39;36:41;"Just go along"
36:41;36:44;"'Til they turn out the lights"
36:44;36:49;"There's nothing we can do to fight it"
36:49;36:53;"No man's got it made"
36:53;36:59;"'Til he's far beyond the pain"
36:59;37:03;"And we who must remain"
37:03;37:09;"Go on living just the same"
37:09;37:12;"guitar solo"
37:12;37:14;"I once knew a man"
37:14;37:17;"A very talented guy"
37:17;37:19;"He'd sing for the people"
37:19;37:22;"And people would cry"
37:22;37:26;"And his song came from deep down inside"
37:26;37:29;"You could hear it in his voice"
37:29;37:34;"And see it in his eyes"
37:34;37:37;"And so he traveled along"
37:37;37:39;"Touch your heart"
37:39;37:41;"And then be gone"
37:41;37:45;"Like a flower he bloomed"
37:45;37:49;"'Til that old hickory wind"
37:49;37:52;"Called him home"
37:52;37:55;"My man's got it made"
37:55;38:01;"He's gone far beyond the pain"
38:01;38:05;"And we who must remain"
38:05;38:11;"Go on living just the same"
38:11;38:33;"guitar solo"
38:33;38:37;"My man's got it made"
38:37;38:43;"He's gone far beyond the pain"
38:43;38:47;"And we who must remain"
38:47;38:53;"Go on living just the same"
38:53;38:57;"We who must remain"
38:57;39:11;"Go on laughing just the same"
39:11;39:13;"That was ""The Eagles"" with my man."
39:13;39:15;"The first song in Jake Longstreet's"
39:15;39:17;"""Defense of the Eagles."""
39:17;39:19;"That's a pretty good song."
39:19;39:22;"I don't know if that's gonna convert the haters."
39:22;39:24;"No, probably not."
39:24;39:27;"My defense is somewhat ambivalent."
39:27;39:29;"I like ""The Eagles."""
39:29;39:32;"I would even say I'm a fan of ""The Eagles."""
39:32;39:35;"But I definitely see why people don't like them"
39:35;39:38;"and they're reviled, and that's fascinating to me."
39:38;39:40;"I feel like ""The Eagles"" were essentially"
39:40;39:42;"the pop music of the day, in a way."
39:42;39:43;"Yeah, yeah."
39:43;39:45;"And I feel like there's a lot of times"
39:45;39:48;"that there's an argument to be made"
39:48;39:50;"that is kind of just like--"
39:50;39:52;"it's almost like a kind of nihilistic"
39:52;39:54;"or pessimistic view of the world"
39:54;39:56;"that's kind of like, yeah, you know what?"
39:56;39:58;"You hate on pop music because it's simple"
39:58;40:00;"or something, and you think it's trash."
40:00;40:02;"But you know what? Like, everything's trash."
40:02;40:04;"I'm just saying that you might say--"
40:04;40:06;"like, who's to say that the Beatles or Zeppelin"
40:06;40:08;"is better than ""The Eagles""?"
40:08;40:11;"Yeah, I mean, there's no way to qualitatively prove"
40:11;40:14;"that ""The Eagles"" are lame and Led Zeppelin's awesome."
40:14;40:16;"Well, and also, as time goes by,"
40:16;40:19;"I bet there probably are a lot more young people"
40:19;40:20;"putting on ""The Eagles."""
40:20;40:22;"They're not putting on ""The Sex Pistols."""
40:22;40:23;"Oh, hell no."
40:23;40:25;"They're probably not putting on ""The Ramones."""
40:25;40:26;"Yeah."
40:26;40:29;"They're probably not putting on..."
40:29;40:30;"""Buzzcocks."""
40:30;40:32;"""Buzzcocks."""
40:32;40:34;"I mean, I'm just saying a lot of the music"
40:34;40:37;"of the late '70s that was considered so fresh and cool--"
40:37;40:39;"punk rock, whatever--"
40:39;40:42;"that probably seemed like an antidote to ""The Eagles."""
40:42;40:43;"Yeah, yeah."
40:43;40:45;"I don't know. I don't think the youth"
40:45;40:47;"are particularly preferring punk rock to ""The Eagles."""
40:47;40:48;"I see what you're saying."
40:48;40:51;"I think we're in sort of like a post-ideological place"
40:51;40:53;"where it's all just sort of available."
40:53;40:56;"That's sort of like a common talking point these days,"
40:56;40:58;"and I think there's some truth to it."
40:58;41:01;"Well, look, if there are any young people listening,"
41:01;41:03;"anybody under the age of 25,"
41:03;41:08;"tweet @JakeLongstreth your opinion on ""The Eagles,"""
41:08;41:10;"and we'll read it to ourselves."
41:10;41:12;"That's on the Twitter."
41:12;41:13;"What's your...?"
41:13;41:14;"Dongstreth."
41:14;41:19;"So tweet @Dongstreth, that's D-O-N-G-S-T-R-E-T-H,"
41:19;41:21;"and let him know how you feel about ""The Eagles,"""
41:21;41:24;"'cause we want to have some feedback on the program."
41:24;41:26;"So let's get into another ""Eagles"" song, Jake."
41:26;41:28;"What's another song you might pick"
41:28;41:30;"that maybe people haven't heard"
41:30;41:33;"that kind of-- to make a case for these guys?"
41:33;41:36;"Let's do ""Dulin Dalton."""
41:36;41:37;"""Dulin Dalton."""
41:37;41:38;"That's another one."
41:38;41:39;"That's a funny name."
41:39;41:42;"Yeah, that's the first track on the Desperado album."
41:42;41:44;"I assume this is about the Upper East Side"
41:44;41:47;"private school Dalton School in New York."
41:47;41:49;"You would be wrong."
41:49;41:53;"It is--it's the first song on a concept album"
41:53;41:55;"called ""Desperado,"""
41:55;41:58;"which was sort of a half-baked concept album"
41:58;42:00;"about the Old West,"
42:00;42:04;"and it's Bill Dalton meets Bill Dulin."
42:04;42:05;"Okay."
42:05;42:06;"And they duel."
42:06;42:07;"Two guys named Bill."
42:07;42:08;"Yeah."
42:08;42:09;"Okay, so let's get into this."

45:35;45:38;"I should point out that it's spelled D-O-O-L-I-N."
45:38;45:42;"It's a name, so I guess that's a play on words, Dulin Dalton."
45:42;45:45;"Like, the cover of that record is them dressed up as cowboys."
45:45;45:46;"Right."
45:46;45:50;"It's like a kitschy exploration of themes of the Old West."
45:50;45:52;"So that was on ""Desperado."""
45:52;45:56;"I feel like Henley kind of hits his peak with the ""Hotel California"" album."
45:56;45:58;"I think that's the album that most people are familiar with."
45:58;46:00;"""Hotel California"" is probably their most famous song."
46:00;46:02;"It's like their signature song."
46:02;46:05;"Yeah. Not a song that I want to hear a lot of,"
46:05;46:07;"maybe because I've heard it so much."
46:07;46:09;"But lyrically, that song is incredible."
46:09;46:10;"It's dark."
46:10;46:11;"Right."
46:11;46:14;"Well, yeah, it's the first song on the ""Hotel California"" record."
46:14;46:17;"And it's like--it follows--it's a little ambiguous,"
46:17;46:19;"but it follows the journey of this guy"
46:19;46:21;"driving down a desert highway at night,"
46:21;46:24;"smelling the desert flowers,"
46:24;46:27;"and he sees this off in the distance a shimmering light."
46:27;46:29;"Which is L.A., you think?"
46:29;46:30;"Yeah."
46:30;46:34;"And ""Hotel California"" is--he checks into the ""Hotel California."""
46:34;46:35;"Right."
46:35;46:38;"And it's obviously a metaphor for him coming to L.A."
46:38;46:40;"with a sense of ambition and dreams."
46:40;46:41;"Yeah."
46:41;46:44;"And then as the album progresses, he becomes the new kid in town."
46:44;46:45;"Mm-hmm."
46:45;46:47;"You know, talk on the street sounds so familiar."
46:47;46:48;"Right."
46:48;46:50;"And then he gets into life in the fast lane."
46:50;46:51;"Okay."
46:51;46:52;"And he loses himself."
46:52;46:53;"Yeah."
46:53;46:59;"And so through his desire to achieve the fame in the American dream,"
46:59;47:01;"he becomes disillusioned throughout the record."
47:01;47:02;"It's very Faustian."
47:02;47:03;"Yeah."
47:03;47:05;"Be careful what you wish for."
47:05;47:08;"I mean, the funny part to me is that the Eagles did achieve--"
47:08;47:09;"Right."
47:09;47:12;"--this story that they're sort of satirizing."
47:12;47:14;"Yeah, I always find that funny as an artist,"
47:14;47:16;"and I think about that sometimes myself,"
47:16;47:22;"is like that so many artists--like here's an example."
47:22;47:25;"Like, remember second or third album, Britney Spears,"
47:25;47:27;"she had this song called ""Lucky."""
47:27;47:30;"The video was all about her being like an old-school Hollywood starlet"
47:30;47:33;"who's like depressed in her room, which probably was true because--"
47:33;47:34;"Sure."
47:34;47:39;"--a lot of people who achieve success in this miserable, you know,"
47:39;47:43;"late capitalist hell suffer from depression and anxiety."
47:43;47:46;"But there's something funny about that you get those messages"
47:46;47:50;"in the form of albums and movies."
47:50;47:55;"Like the rich, successful artists are the ones telling you this cautionary tale"
47:55;47:57;"about becoming a rich, successful artist."
47:57;48:01;"So it's almost like it's an American tradition to like get rich and successful"
48:01;48:03;"and then just kind of like--"
48:03;48:04;"Yeah, like--"
48:04;48:05;"Yeah."
48:05;48:08;"--distance yourself or satirize it and say how miserable I am."
48:08;48:09;"I mean--"
48:09;48:11;"Like what are you supposed to take away from that?"
48:11;48:12;"Like don't be like the Eagles?"
48:12;48:13;"Well, I think--no."
48:13;48:16;"I think what you're supposed to take away is that it's a sad--"
48:16;48:19;"I think you could apply it to kind of anyone's life."
48:19;48:22;"It's the sad underbelly of the American dream."
48:22;48:28;"I think everyone is sort of striving, I think in this case, for material wealth."
48:28;48:29;"Yeah."
48:29;48:33;"And I think that album explores like that is going to be an empty pursuit."
48:33;48:36;"And I should also point out that I've been thinking about this a lot too"
48:36;48:41;"is that a lot of times we talk about the idea that the American obsession"
48:41;48:43;"with wealth and success is what's so empty."
48:43;48:48;"But then I was thinking people in a lot of religions, people have been saying,"
48:48;48:51;"like in Buddhism, that desire is the root of all suffering."
48:51;48:54;"They're saying that pre-capitalism thousands of years ago."
48:54;48:55;"Absolutely."
48:55;48:57;"So in some ways it's like an eternal theme beyond money,"
48:57;49:02;"just the idea that pursuing desires and achieving them,"
49:02;49:05;"there's something fundamentally sad about that in the human experience."
49:05;49:07;"What's the next thing?"
49:07;49:12;"I've heard it described this way, that desire is a moving target."
49:12;49:15;"So you achieve it and it keeps moving further."
49:15;49:19;"So there's no such thing as truly achieving peace until whatever,"
49:19;49:21;"you destroy your ego or something."
49:21;49:24;"Well, this explains the enduring power of Hotel California."
49:24;49:26;"Yes."
49:26;49:29;"But you don't want to listen to Hotel California because you're trying to stay away from the hits."
49:29;49:32;"Like I said, I think it's kind of messed up and perverse to come into your show"
49:32;49:35;"and play Hotel California."
49:35;49:38;"I think my favorite song off that album is called ""Try and Love Again,"""
49:38;49:43;"which is towards the end of the album, it's written and sung by Randy Meisner."
49:43;49:46;"Why is that name so funny?"
49:46;49:49;"It's a great name. Randy is just a great name."
49:49;49:52;"And so it's sort of towards the end of the album and he is just like,"
49:52;49:56;"this character has just been to the ringer and he's just going to try and love again."
49:56;49:59;"He's just like down at the bottom, he's going to try to start his ascent back up."
49:59;50:05;"And that's interesting because a lot of people would say that one of the things"
50:05;50:10;"that allows us to get through the cycle of desire and dissatisfaction or whatever is love."
50:10;50:11;"Absolutely."
50:11;50:15;"So to try and love again, I could imagine that being a nice ending to this saga."
50:15;50:16;"Yeah."
50:16;50:22;"So here's The Eagles featuring Randy Meisner on lead vocals with ""Try and Love Again."""

55:19;55:21;"the third and final pick from Jake Longstreth"
55:21;55:25;"in his passionate/ambivalent defense of the Eagles."
55:25;55:26;"I think that is a beautiful song."
55:26;55:27;"- Yeah. - I think that might be"
55:27;55:29;"my favorite of the three that you played."
55:29;55:30;"- I think so too."
55:30;55:32;"- Well, we really appreciate you coming through"
55:32;55:34;"and making a case for the Eagles."
55:34;55:37;"Unlike the dead, the youth don't really hate them."
55:37;55:38;"They're just kind of indifferent."
55:38;55:41;"So if you just wanna make one final plea"
55:41;55:42;"to the people out there"
55:42;55:45;"about why they should give the Eagles a chance,"
55:45;55:47;"you wanna just kind of wrap it up?"
55:47;55:49;"- Well, yeah, I mean, like the Eagles don't need me"
55:49;55:50;"to go to bat for them,"
55:50;55:53;"but I think with the Eagles,"
55:53;55:54;"there is sort of like,"
55:54;55:56;"if you dig deep and actually listen to the lyrics,"
55:56;56:01;"there are some surprisingly dark and satirical"
56:01;56:03;"and funny aspects to their music."
56:03;56:08;"On the surface, it's very kind of borderline generic,"
56:08;56:10;"palatable country rock."
56:10;56:11;"- Right. - But when you actually"
56:11;56:13;"kinda get into it, there's a whole,"
56:13;56:18;"especially with Henley, his lyrics are all about"
56:18;56:21;"sort of like the ideals of the '60s not working out."
56:21;56:23;"- Right. - And as you follow"
56:23;56:26;"Don Henley's solo career into the '80s,"
56:26;56:28;"he had that song ""Boys of Summer."""
56:28;56:30;"- Beautiful song. - With that iconic lyric,"
56:30;56:31;"""Out on the road today,"
56:31;56:33;"""saw a deadhead sticker on a Cadillac."""
56:33;56:35;"- Right. - So there's an old guy"
56:35;56:38;"driving some old guy car with a deadhead sticker."
56:38;56:39;"- Yeah. - And sort of like,"
56:39;56:41;"coming to terms with sort of like,"
56:41;56:43;"the spirit of the '60s and his youth"
56:43;56:47;"and that kind of going into like Reagan era capitalism."
56:47;56:49;"And I feel like that is like the drive,"
56:49;56:52;"like to me that's the compelling narrative in ""The Eagles."""
56:52;56:55;"- It's just kind of watching things change and fall apart."
56:55;56:57;"- Right. - And that's maybe why"
56:57;56:59;"there's a bit of melancholy. - Absolutely."
56:59;57:01;"- Running through. - Yeah."
57:01;57:02;"- Well, thank you very much, Jake."
57:02;57:06;"I think you did a great job making a case for ""The Eagles."""

01:02:01;01:02:04;"Beats one."
01:02:04;01:02:07;"- Jake and I are now joined in the studio"
01:02:07;01:02:09;"by Demi Adijuwebe."
01:02:09;01:02:10;"- Hello."
01:02:10;01:02:12;"- But a lot of you might know him better"
01:02:12;01:02:14;"as ElectroLemon from Twitter."
01:02:14;01:02:15;"- Yeah."
01:02:15;01:02:16;"- That's your Twitter handle."
01:02:16;01:02:17;"- Yeah, it is."
01:02:17;01:02:19;"- Am I pronouncing ElectroLemon correctly?"
01:02:19;01:02:21;"- Perfectly, although, I mean,"
01:02:21;01:02:23;"there's not really any real pronunciation"
01:02:23;01:02:25;"of anything that I would say"
01:02:25;01:02:27;"I created online, you know?"
01:02:27;01:02:29;"It's like when people say there's gif and jif,"
01:02:29;01:02:30;"I think it doesn't matter."
01:02:30;01:02:31;"- Because it's just text."
01:02:31;01:02:32;"- Right."
01:02:32;01:02:34;"- 'Cause maybe some people think it's ElectroLemon."
01:02:34;01:02:35;"- Some people do."
01:02:35;01:02:36;"People have said that to me."
01:02:36;01:02:37;"- Like King Solomon."
01:02:37;01:02:38;"- Yeah."
01:02:38;01:02:40;"- So I first knew you through Twitter."
01:02:40;01:02:42;"You're not a full-time tweeter."
01:02:42;01:02:43;"- No."
01:02:43;01:02:44;"- What else do you do?"
01:02:44;01:02:46;"- I work on a TV show called At Midnight."
01:02:46;01:02:48;"I'm a digital producer over there."
01:02:48;01:02:51;"I work on social videos for their online stuff"
01:02:51;01:02:52;"and sometimes for the show."
01:02:52;01:02:54;"And then I also do a podcast"
01:02:54;01:02:56;"where I talk about Gilmore Girls."
01:02:56;01:02:58;"- Now, Gilmore Girls, for people who don't know,"
01:02:58;01:02:59;"that's a TV program."
01:02:59;01:03:00;"- Yeah."
01:03:00;01:03:01;"- Is it still on?"
01:03:01;01:03:02;"What channel can I catch it on?"
01:03:02;01:03:04;"- You can catch it on ABC Family,"
01:03:04;01:03:06;"although it's been off the air for eight years."
01:03:06;01:03:08;"You can catch reruns on ABC Family."
01:03:08;01:03:09;"- Oh, what, they canceled it?"
01:03:09;01:03:12;"- Yeah, like seven years after they started."
01:03:12;01:03:13;"So they had a good run."
01:03:13;01:03:14;"- Okay."
01:03:14;01:03:15;"So what do you guys talk about,"
01:03:15;01:03:17;"like specifically, with Gilmore Girls?"
01:03:17;01:03:19;"- Well, so I have never seen the show"
01:03:19;01:03:21;"and my friends are really big fan of it,"
01:03:21;01:03:24;"so we started watching every single episode as we go"
01:03:24;01:03:27;"and just each episode is a recap of that episode"
01:03:27;01:03:28;"and our opinions on the episode."
01:03:28;01:03:31;"And right now, we're just about to start season five."
01:03:31;01:03:33;"- And you still have never watched a single episode?"
01:03:33;01:03:34;"- No, no, I haven't."
01:03:34;01:03:35;"- Oh, you actually watch it and then--"
01:03:35;01:03:37;"- Although I'd love to do a show"
01:03:37;01:03:38;"where I talk about an episode of something"
01:03:38;01:03:40;"having not watched it ever."
01:03:40;01:03:42;"- Jake, are you familiar with this program?"
01:03:42;01:03:43;"- No, I mean, I've heard of it."
01:03:43;01:03:44;"- You've heard of Gilmore Girls."
01:03:44;01:03:46;"- And so that's a show that has Maniac fans."
01:03:46;01:03:48;"- Oh, yeah."
01:03:48;01:03:50;"- And this show, it takes place in New England?"
01:03:50;01:03:51;"- Yeah, Connecticut."
01:03:51;01:03:52;"- Where, Connecticut?"
01:03:52;01:03:53;"- Hartford."
01:03:53;01:03:54;"- That's where Jake's from."
01:03:54;01:03:54;"- Yeah."
01:03:54;01:03:54;"- Oh, really?"
01:03:54;01:03:57;"- I don't think there's enough Connecticut-based programs."
01:03:57;01:03:59;"- It's set in Hartford specifically?"
01:03:59;01:04:01;"- Well, it's in Hartford and in a fictional town"
01:04:01;01:04:03;"called Stars Hollow outside of Hartford."
01:04:03;01:04:05;"- And Stars Hollow is like a kind of preppy,"
01:04:05;01:04:07;"little all-American type town?"
01:04:07;01:04:09;"- Yeah, there's like a thousand people in it."
01:04:09;01:04:11;"- Okay."
01:04:11;01:04:12;"- Hartford's a weird choice, sorry."
01:04:12;01:04:13;"- Yeah, Hartford's definitely a weird choice."
01:04:13;01:04:15;"- That's just a zero."
01:04:15;01:04:17;"- Where would you have made it if you had--"
01:04:17;01:04:19;"- I mean, if you want to do a glamorous sort of"
01:04:19;01:04:21;"Connecticut thing on TV, you would do like"
01:04:21;01:04:23;"the southwest corner, you would do--"
01:04:23;01:04:23;"- Greenwich."
01:04:23;01:04:25;"- Greenwich, Fairfield."
01:04:25;01:04:27;"- You know what television program took place"
01:04:27;01:04:29;"in Connecticut a little bit?"
01:04:29;01:04:30;"- What?"
01:04:30;01:04:31;"- Mad Men."
01:04:31;01:04:32;"- Oh, yeah."
01:04:32;01:04:33;"- Pete Campbell moves to Connecticut--"
01:04:33;01:04:34;"- Oh, right."
01:04:34;01:04:35;"- And lives in Costco."
01:04:35;01:04:37;"- Which is funny because Vincent Carthizer,"
01:04:37;01:04:40;"who plays Pete Campbell, is now married to Alexa Badell."
01:04:40;01:04:42;"- Who was the star of Gilmore Girls."
01:04:42;01:04:42;"- That's correct."
01:04:42;01:04:43;"- She was the Gilmore Girl."
01:04:43;01:04:43;"- Yeah."
01:04:43;01:04:47;"- Okay, guys, so Gilmore Girls, check it out on ABC Family."
01:04:47;01:04:49;"We're going to be right back with more from Electrolymon."
01:04:49;01:04:52;"Now here is Francoise Ardy with I Think It's Gonna Rain Today."
01:04:52;01:04:55;"[MUSIC - FRANCOISE ARDY, ""I THINK IT'S GONNA RAIN TODAY""]"
01:04:55;01:05:05;"An empty hallways, pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey."
01:05:05;01:05:11;"Human kindness overflowing."
01:05:11;01:05:15;"And I think it's gonna rain today."
01:05:18;01:05:26;"Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles with frozen smiles"
01:05:26;01:05:30;"to chase all the rain."
01:05:30;01:05:36;"Human kindness overflowing."
01:05:36;01:05:40;"And I think it's gonna rain today."
01:05:44;01:05:50;"Lonely, lonely."
01:05:50;01:06:02;"Tinkering at my feet, think I'll kick it down the street."
01:06:02;01:06:06;"That's the way to treat a friend."
01:06:11;01:06:17;"Right before me, the signs imploring."
01:06:17;01:06:23;"Help the needy and show them the way."
01:06:23;01:06:29;"Human kindness overflowing."
01:06:29;01:06:33;"And I think it's gonna rain today."
01:06:33;01:06:39;"Lonely, lonely."
01:06:40;01:06:43;"Lonely, lonely."
01:06:43;01:06:55;"Tinkering at my feet, think I'll kick it down the street."
01:06:55;01:06:59;"That's the way to treat a friend."
01:07:04;01:07:09;"Right before me, the signs imploring."
01:07:09;01:07:15;"Help the needy and show them the way."
01:07:15;01:07:21;"Human kindness overflowing."
01:07:21;01:07:26;"And I think it's gonna rain today."
01:07:30;01:07:40;"This summer I went swimming."
01:07:40;01:07:43;"This summer I might have drowned."
01:07:43;01:07:46;"But I held my breath and I kicked my feet"
01:07:46;01:07:48;"and I moved my arms around."
01:07:48;01:07:51;"Moved my arms around."
01:07:51;01:07:53;"This summer I swam in the ocean."
01:07:53;01:07:56;"And I swam in a swimming pool."
01:07:56;01:07:59;"Salt my wounds, chlorine my eyes."
01:07:59;01:08:01;"I'm a self-destructive fool."
01:08:01;01:08:04;"I'm a self-destructive fool."
01:08:04;01:08:19;"This summer I did the backstroke."
01:08:19;01:08:22;"And you know that that's not all."
01:08:22;01:08:25;"I did the breaststroke and the butterfly"
01:08:25;01:08:27;"and the old Australian crawl."
01:08:27;01:08:30;"The old Australian crawl."
01:08:30;01:08:33;"This summer I swam in a public place."
01:08:33;01:08:35;"In a reservoir to boot."
01:08:35;01:08:38;"At the latter I was informal."
01:08:38;01:08:40;"At the former I wore my suit."
01:08:40;01:08:44;"I wore my swimming suit, yeah."
01:08:48;01:08:58;"This summer I did swan dives"
01:08:58;01:09:01;"and jet knives with you all."
01:09:01;01:09:03;"But once when you weren't looking"
01:09:03;01:09:06;"I did a cannonball."
01:09:09;01:09:11;"This summer I went swimming."
01:09:11;01:09:14;"This summer I might have drowned."
01:09:14;01:09:17;"But I held my breath and I kicked my feet"
01:09:17;01:09:19;"and I moved my arms around."
01:09:19;01:09:22;"Moved my arms around."
01:09:28;01:09:50;"That was Loudon Wainwright III with the swimming song."
01:09:50;01:09:54;"Beautiful '70s, kind of crunchy, happy, sad."
01:09:54;01:09:56;"So many emotions in that song."
01:09:56;01:09:57;"Yeah."
01:09:57;01:09:59;"That song, I've never really watched Gilmore Girls,"
01:09:59;01:10:01;"but I imagine Gilmore Girls feels like that song."
01:10:01;01:10:04;"I feel like this show is sponsored by Gilmore Girls unofficially now."
01:10:04;01:10:06;"Okay, I want everybody to check out Gilmore Girls."
01:10:06;01:10:09;"As I said before, Demi, I first met you via Twitter."
01:10:09;01:10:13;"I saw this dude, Electro Lemon, writing up some tweets."
01:10:13;01:10:15;"And we've been meaning to try this on the show"
01:10:15;01:10:18;"because it's 2015, you want to integrate social media"
01:10:18;01:10:20;"with other content."
01:10:20;01:10:22;"So we figured we got somebody who kind of"
01:10:22;01:10:24;"has a healthy relationship with Twitter."
01:10:24;01:10:26;"Why not go through some of his tweets?"
01:10:26;01:10:28;"So why don't you read to us,"
01:10:28;01:10:30;"in whatever voice you think is appropriate,"
01:10:30;01:10:31;"some of your last tweets."
01:10:31;01:10:34;"The very last thing I tweeted was earlier today,"
01:10:34;01:10:36;"and it was, ""If you ever run into me on the street,"
01:10:36;01:10:38;"ask me to do my pitch perfect,"
01:10:38;01:10:41;"'What if Bane was the tiger from Jungle Book' impression."""
01:10:41;01:10:43;"How would you classify those accents?"
01:10:43;01:10:44;"Uh..."
01:10:44;01:10:45;"Fancy man?"
01:10:45;01:10:48;"Well, the one for Bane is definitely a fancy man, but the--"
01:10:48;01:10:50;"A fancy British, like, vaudevillian."
01:10:50;01:10:52;"Right, uh, curled mustache, WD--"
01:10:52;01:10:53;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:10:53;01:10:55;"Exactly. Wait, do that again."
01:10:55;01:10:56;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:10:56;01:10:57;"That's perfect."
01:10:57;01:10:58;"Wait, hold on, can I do a good one?"
01:10:58;01:10:59;"Go for it."
01:10:59;01:11:00;"Bruce Wayne."
01:11:00;01:11:01;"Br--"
01:11:01;01:11:03;"Bruce Wayne!"
01:11:03;01:11:04;"Mm."
01:11:04;01:11:06;"It's like that, but then his mouth is covered"
01:11:06;01:11:08;"by, like, a cheese grater or something."
01:11:08;01:11:09;"I was born in the darkness."
01:11:09;01:11:10;"You merely a--"
01:11:10;01:11:11;"Mm."
01:11:11;01:11:12;"No, no, I give up."
01:11:12;01:11:14;"I didn't even realize that Bane was British."
01:11:14;01:11:17;"Well, Bane is played by one of the greatest actors of all time,"
01:11:17;01:11:18;"Tom Hardy."
01:11:18;01:11:21;"No, I'm aware of that. I'm aware that Tom Hardy is British."
01:11:21;01:11:22;"Right."
01:11:22;01:11:24;"But I never realized that he was doing a British accent"
01:11:24;01:11:25;"doing his natural voice."
01:11:25;01:11:27;"Well, actually, the film implies that Bane is from"
01:11:27;01:11:30;"some sort of, like, Central Asian country."
01:11:30;01:11:31;"Yeah."
01:11:31;01:11:33;"Right? Because Bane is from the country with the pit."
01:11:33;01:11:34;"That's right."
01:11:34;01:11:36;"But you lose your accent in the pit,"
01:11:36;01:11:37;"so you just kind of adopt whatever sounds you hear."
01:11:37;01:11:38;"What was that movie called?"
01:11:38;01:11:39;"The Dark Knight Rises?"
01:11:39;01:11:40;"The Dark Knight Rises."
01:11:40;01:11:41;"That's another one I want every--"
01:11:41;01:11:42;"That movie sucked."
01:11:42;01:11:43;"Excuse me?"
01:11:43;01:11:44;"That movie sucked."
01:11:44;01:11:45;"That was a--"
01:11:45;01:11:46;"Oh, come on, now we're gonna get into it."
01:11:46;01:11:48;"We're gonna talk about Dark Knight Rises and Jake is anti."
01:11:48;01:11:49;"State your case."
01:11:49;01:11:50;"I think--"
01:11:50;01:11:52;"I love that Devon is just taking over as the host now."
01:11:52;01:11:53;"Yeah."
01:11:53;01:11:54;"I actually appreciate that."
01:11:54;01:11:57;"I think that The Dark Knight was a beautiful film."
01:11:57;01:11:59;"I don't know, I just felt like it was moody and dark"
01:11:59;01:12:01;"and better than the Heath Ledger one."
01:12:01;01:12:03;"Wow."
01:12:03;01:12:06;"I found that movie to be unrelentingly grim."
01:12:06;01:12:08;"I felt like they wasted Tom Hardy,"
01:12:08;01:12:11;"who, as you said, is a great actor, very charismatic."
01:12:11;01:12:14;"I didn't even know that that was him."
01:12:14;01:12:17;"I thought Bane had zero--"
01:12:17;01:12:20;"So your primary critique of the film"
01:12:20;01:12:24;"is that they should have had Bane not wear a mask."
01:12:24;01:12:26;"Yeah, and not speak in that stupid voice."
01:12:26;01:12:28;"And also, what happened to Batman's voice?"
01:12:28;01:12:32;"Why is that three octaves lower than a normal human voice?"
01:12:32;01:12:34;"If he's Batman, he's gotta disguise his voice"
01:12:34;01:12:36;"'cause he's also the most famous man in all of Gotham."
01:12:36;01:12:38;"Right, that's what he's doing."
01:12:38;01:12:39;"That's always what I assume he is."
01:12:39;01:12:41;"And also, I loved how weird Bane's voice was"
01:12:41;01:12:43;"and how it was really deep."
01:12:43;01:12:44;"Yeah."
01:12:44;01:12:46;"Someone has to die, comrade!"
01:12:46;01:12:48;"And it's so loud, even though--"
01:12:48;01:12:51;"It's surreal how loud his voice is."
01:12:51;01:12:54;"And here's Boston with more than a feeling."
01:12:54;01:12:56;"Are you serious?"
01:13:07;01:13:11;"I woke up this morning and my sun was gone"
01:13:11;01:13:15;"Turned on some music to start my day"
01:13:15;01:13:20;"And I asked myself, what would be this song?"
01:13:20;01:13:27;"I closed my eyes and I slipped away"
01:13:40;01:13:44;"It's more than a feeling"
01:13:44;01:13:46;"That I hear that I'm falling"
01:13:46;01:13:49;"It's more than a feeling"
01:13:49;01:13:51;"That I'm making dreaming"
01:13:51;01:13:53;"More than a feeling"
01:13:53;01:13:58;"That I see that I'm marrying and walking away"
01:13:58;01:14:07;"I see that I'm marrying and walking away"
01:14:15;01:14:19;"So many people have come and gone"
01:14:19;01:14:24;"Their faces fade as the years go by"
01:14:24;01:14:28;"Yet I stir in hope as I walk alone"
01:14:28;01:14:36;"As clear as the sun in the summer sky"
01:14:49;01:14:53;"It's more than a feeling"
01:14:53;01:14:55;"That I hear that I'm something"
01:14:55;01:14:57;"It's more than a feeling"
01:14:57;01:14:59;"That I'm making dreaming"
01:14:59;01:15:01;"More than a feeling"
01:15:01;01:15:07;"That I see that I'm marrying and walking away"
01:15:07;01:15:13;"I see that I'm marrying and walking away"
01:15:53;01:15:57;"When I'm tired and thick and cold"
01:15:57;01:16:02;"I hide in my music, forget the day"
01:16:02;01:16:06;"And dream of a girl I used to know"
01:16:06;01:16:18;"I close my eyes and she slips away"
01:16:18;01:16:25;"She slips away"
01:16:46;01:16:50;"It's more than a feeling"
01:16:50;01:16:53;"That I hear that I'm something"
01:16:53;01:16:55;"It's more than a feeling"
01:16:55;01:16:57;"That I'm making dreaming"
01:16:57;01:16:59;"More than a feeling"
01:16:59;01:17:04;"That I see that I'm marrying and walking away"
01:17:22;01:17:24;"That was Boston with More Than a Feeling."
01:17:24;01:17:27;"This is Ezra at Time Crisis, Episode 4."
01:17:27;01:17:30;"I'm here in the studio with Jake Longstreth"
01:17:30;01:17:33;"and Demi, a.k.a. ElectroLemon."
01:17:33;01:17:35;"Let's get into some more music, 'cause pretty soon"
01:17:35;01:17:37;"we're having our very special guest Jamie Foxx coming through."
01:17:37;01:17:40;"I'm gonna play a Linda Ronstadt song,"
01:17:40;01:17:42;"because Jake and I earlier were talking about the Eagles"
01:17:42;01:17:44;"and how they started in her band."
01:17:44;01:17:46;"This is a song called Long, Long Time,"
01:17:46;01:17:49;"and legend has it that this song is so sad"
01:17:49;01:17:51;"it can drive people to do horrible things."
01:17:51;01:17:54;"There used to be an urban legend that Long, Long Time"
01:17:54;01:17:57;"was so sad that radio stations had to ban it"
01:17:57;01:17:59;"because too many people would kill themselves when they--"
01:17:59;01:18:00;"What?"
01:18:00;01:18:02;"Yeah, I need to make something clear."
01:18:02;01:18:04;"I don't believe that that urban legend is true."
01:18:04;01:18:06;"So here's a beautiful song"
01:18:06;01:18:08;"that has a horrible urban legend attached to it."
01:18:08;01:18:11;"Here's Linda Ronstadt with Long, Long Time."
01:18:11;01:18:16;"# Long, long time"

01:22:29;01:22:32;"I hope that didn't make anybody extra depressed."
01:22:32;01:22:34;"It is a sad song, though."
01:22:34;01:22:37;"She might have one of the greatest voices"
01:22:37;01:22:39;"of the past 100 years."
01:22:39;01:22:42;"Also, Jake and I were talking a little bit before"
01:22:42;01:22:45;"about how there's a kind of unusual theme to this song."
01:22:45;01:22:48;"I mean, how many songs are there about heartbreak?"
01:22:48;01:22:51;"A million. Billions. I was thinking more billions."
01:22:51;01:22:54;"One thing I like about this song is that what makes the theme"
01:22:54;01:22:57;"what makes it more brutal, if you listen to the lyrics,"
01:22:57;01:23:00;"it's about somebody who never got with the object of their affection."
01:23:00;01:23:02;"It's not even a breakup song."
01:23:02;01:23:05;"She literally says, ""I can't say that you hurt me"
01:23:05;01:23:07;"when you never let me near."""
01:23:07;01:23:10;"So basically, I mean, it's so much sadder."
01:23:10;01:23:13;"And she's basically saying-- and every chorus changes a little bit,"
01:23:13;01:23:15;"but the one that really gets me is,"
01:23:15;01:23:18;"""'Cause I've done everything I could to try to make you mine"
01:23:18;01:23:21;"and I think it's gonna hurt me for a long, long time."""
01:23:21;01:23:23;"Wow. So sad. Amazing."
01:23:23;01:23:26;"So it's almost like-- you know what it reminds me of, too?"
01:23:26;01:23:29;"It's a little bit like ""I Will Always Love You, Dolly Parton"""
01:23:29;01:23:34;"is that kind of mix of sadness but also acceptance."
01:23:34;01:23:37;"""'Cause I Will Always Love You"" is a breakup song"
01:23:37;01:23:40;"that basically says, ""It's never gonna work out between us."
01:23:40;01:23:43;"You gotta go do your thing, but I'll always love you."""
01:23:43;01:23:46;"And I don't think it's a coincidence that that song"
01:23:46;01:23:48;"has that kind of unique theme,"
01:23:48;01:23:50;"and that's one of the biggest songs of all time."
01:23:50;01:23:54;"I think we should listen to that now before Jamie gets here."
01:23:54;01:23:57;"Let everybody at home have a good cry. Sunday afternoon."
01:23:57;01:23:59;"I'm loving this heartbreaker stuff."
01:23:59;01:24:01;"Yeah, we really got into a heartbreak vibe."
01:24:01;01:24:02;"I'm in."
01:24:02;01:24:05;"Yeah. So here's Dolly Parton with another deeply sad song."
01:24:05;01:24:07;"""I Will Always Love You."""
01:24:07;01:24:15;"♪"
01:24:15;01:24:22;"♪ If I should stay"
01:24:22;01:24:29;"♪ I would only be in your way"
01:24:29;01:24:33;"♪ So I'll go"
01:24:33;01:24:36;"♪ But I know"
01:24:36;01:24:39;"♪ I'll think of you"
01:24:39;01:24:44;"♪ Each step of the way"
01:24:44;01:24:53;"♪ And I will always love you"
01:24:53;01:25:02;"♪ I will always love you"
01:25:02;01:25:12;"♪ Bitter sweet memories"
01:25:12;01:25:19;"♪ That's all I am taking with me"
01:25:19;01:25:22;"♪ Goodbye"
01:25:22;01:25:26;"♪ Please don't cry"
01:25:26;01:25:34;"♪ We both know that I'm not what you need"
01:25:34;01:25:43;"♪ I will always love you"
01:25:52;01:25:56;"♪"
01:25:56;01:26:02;"♪ I hope life treats you kind"
01:26:02;01:26:09;"♪ And I hope that you have all that you ever dreamed of"
01:26:09;01:26:16;"♪ And I wish you joy and happiness"
01:26:16;01:26:19;"♪ But above all of this"
01:26:19;01:26:23;"♪ I wish you love"
01:26:23;01:26:32;"♪ And I will always love you"

01:26:53;01:26:57;"This is Time Crisis."
01:26:57;01:27:00;"(laughs)"
01:27:00;01:27:02;"Welcome back to Time Crisis."
01:27:02;01:27:06;"We are now very excited to be joined by Jamie Foxx."
01:27:06;01:27:09;"Yes, yes, in the house like furniture, down like gravity,"
01:27:09;01:27:10;"it's going down."
01:27:10;01:27:12;"That's right, Jamie Foxx, can't believe it,"
01:27:12;01:27:13;"is here on Time Crisis."
01:27:13;01:27:17;"We're also still joined by Demi, a.k.a. Electro Lemon,"
01:27:17;01:27:19;"and Jake Longstreth."
01:27:19;01:27:20;"Yes, sir."
01:27:20;01:27:21;"I debate thee."
01:27:21;01:27:23;"We were talking just before about how Demi was on the debate team"
01:27:23;01:27:24;"in high school."
01:27:24;01:27:25;"That's true."
01:27:25;01:27:26;"Yeah, plain old, plain old."
01:27:26;01:27:27;"I'm from Texas."
01:27:27;01:27:28;"Yeah."
01:27:28;01:27:30;"Tejas, before the white man took it from the Indians."
01:27:30;01:27:31;"Right?"
01:27:31;01:27:32;"That's true."
01:27:32;01:27:33;"Okay, just checking."
01:27:33;01:27:34;"Yeah, no."
01:27:34;01:27:35;"Well, he's not history, he's debate."
01:27:35;01:27:37;"I'll debate history."
01:27:37;01:27:38;"Really?"
01:27:38;01:27:42;"Anyway, being from Texas is just me."
01:27:42;01:27:43;"I said being from Texas is just me."
01:27:43;01:27:44;"Oh, yeah."
01:27:44;01:27:45;"You threw me off with that."
01:27:45;01:27:46;"Sorry about that."
01:27:46;01:27:47;"No, I mean, Texas is a great state."
01:27:47;01:27:48;"I miss it."
01:27:49;01:27:50;"Get into it."
01:27:50;01:27:51;"Weigh in."
01:27:51;01:27:52;"I'm writing."
01:27:52;01:27:57;"I don't know because all of this stuff has happened on the Republican side,"
01:27:57;01:27:59;"and I think that they're at a loss."
01:27:59;01:28:01;"I don't think they're going to--they don't have a chance."
01:28:01;01:28:04;"Their front runner is an insane man, and people aren't taking him seriously,"
01:28:04;01:28:08;"but the people who are are, like, really--like, I think that so many people"
01:28:08;01:28:12;"are taking Trump as a joke candidate that he might, like, have leverage"
01:28:12;01:28:15;"just because people aren't--they're underestimating him,"
01:28:15;01:28:18;"and that's a bummer because I really don't want him to be president."
01:28:18;01:28:21;"But on the Democratic side, all the nominees are so scattered."
01:28:21;01:28:24;"Like, it's really Bernie and Hillary, and then there's rumblings of other people"
01:28:24;01:28:25;"joining the race."
01:28:25;01:28:27;"People act like Hillary's just going to win."
01:28:27;01:28:28;"It's like a foregone conclusion."
01:28:28;01:28:29;"I don't think so, though."
01:28:29;01:28:31;"Well, I can tell you like this."
01:28:31;01:28:36;"I think what is happening now is everybody's running so fast,"
01:28:36;01:28:40;"and it's very, very early, and I think what's going to eventually happen,"
01:28:40;01:28:44;"things are going to settle, and you're going to say the familiarity part of it,"
01:28:44;01:28:47;"Jeb Bush familiarity, Hillary Clinton familiarity."
01:28:47;01:28:50;"Unfortunately for Donald Trump--you know, I'm a comic,"
01:28:50;01:28:54;"so I love the fact that he--you know, they're bringing crime,"
01:28:54;01:28:57;"they're bringing drugs, they're bringing rapists,"
01:28:57;01:29:00;"President Obama, the birth certificate."
01:29:00;01:29:01;"It's just great for me."
01:29:01;01:29:02;"It's a flawed suppression."
01:29:02;01:29:04;"It's just great."
01:29:04;01:29:08;"Unfortunately, he shoots himself in the foot because he does actually say"
01:29:08;01:29:13;"some things that people are actually like--you know, that they're tired of politics."
01:29:13;01:29:15;"Everybody is tired of politics."
01:29:15;01:29:18;"And unfortunately, he makes it such a joke,"
01:29:18;01:29:23;"and I think that's what sort of--we may have to start talking about--we have to"
01:29:23;01:29:29;"have some type of criteria before you run for president because it's getting a little crazy."
01:29:29;01:29:32;"I mean, some of the inflammatory things that he said about the Latinos"
01:29:32;01:29:36;"and things like that, and then all of a sudden Heidi Klum is not a 10."
01:29:36;01:29:39;"He's just going crazy."
01:29:39;01:29:42;"It's like a comedian having a hot set, so he's just hitting everybody,"
01:29:42;01:29:46;"and it just goes like, wow, this is really the goofy part of politics right now."
01:29:46;01:29:48;"It scares me a little bit."
01:29:48;01:29:50;"But it seems like it's paying off."
01:29:50;01:29:51;"Yeah, I mean--"
01:29:51;01:29:52;"For him."
01:29:52;01:29:54;"Early, yeah, early."
01:29:54;01:29:57;"It's so weird because every time I see that Trump is doing well,"
01:29:57;01:29:59;"I want to find--like I don't know anyone who supports him,"
01:29:59;01:30:03;"so I just want to find the person who does and be like, what's happening?"
01:30:03;01:30:04;"Why is he ranking so high in the polls?"
01:30:04;01:30:07;"Why do you genuinely support this man for president?"
01:30:07;01:30:09;"And I don't get it."
01:30:09;01:30:12;"It exposes a lot of candidates a little bit with the money thing"
01:30:12;01:30:15;"and saying candidates are sort of puppets."
01:30:15;01:30:20;"I think what the other candidates should do, though, is sort of be a little more vocal."
01:30:20;01:30:23;"They're so worried about political correctness,"
01:30:23;01:30:29;"and you don't have to be a Donald Trump, but you can take the lid off of things a little bit."
01:30:29;01:30:32;"Everybody's so worried that they'll get memed, social media, this, that,"
01:30:32;01:30:37;"and I think that's what--it's sort of weirdly refreshing with Donald Trump."
01:30:37;01:30:40;"That weird--"
01:30:40;01:30:42;"Like taking the lid off."
01:30:42;01:30:43;"The debate was hilarious."
01:30:43;01:30:46;"It was like watching Def Comedy Jam when the girl--"
01:30:46;01:30:49;"Donald, you've said so many things about women."
01:30:49;01:30:52;"You've called them dogs, and you've called them--only Rosie O'Donnell."
01:30:52;01:30:53;"I mean, he got a standing ovation."
01:30:53;01:30:54;"It was funny."
01:30:54;01:31:00;"So I think they should learn from just that you don't have to be so guarded."
01:31:00;01:31:03;"Let us hear from you, Hillary Clinton."
01:31:03;01:31:08;"Let us hear from you, Jeb Bush or Rubio, a little bit more,"
01:31:08;01:31:12;"because I think it's boring, you know?"
01:31:12;01:31:14;"He's keeping it interesting."
01:31:14;01:31:15;"That's for sure."
01:31:15;01:31:20;"So here on Time Crisis, we like to do a segment where we go through the top five songs on iTunes"
01:31:20;01:31:21;"and just talk about them."
01:31:21;01:31:23;"This is a good way just to kind of see what--"
01:31:23;01:31:24;"See if I even know them."
01:31:24;01:31:26;"We've already been talking about the state of politics in America."
01:31:26;01:31:27;"I've been listening to my own music at that rate."
01:31:27;01:31:28;"Well, we'll see."
01:31:28;01:31:29;"We'll see how much of it you know."
01:31:29;01:31:32;"And now we're going to be talking about the state of pop music in America."
01:31:32;01:31:38;"It's time for the top five on iTunes."
01:31:38;01:31:42;"So a lot of these songs we've been talking about all summer because they just won't get off the charts."
01:31:42;01:31:44;"So I don't know who knows what."
01:31:44;01:31:46;"I'm not going to set anything up."
01:31:46;01:31:48;"We're just going to listen and discuss."
01:31:48;01:31:51;"This is number five."
01:31:51;01:31:55;"This is a big song called ""Cheerleader"" by Omin."
01:31:55;01:31:56;"You familiar, Jamie?"
01:31:56;01:31:57;"Yeah."
01:31:57;01:31:58;"You heard it?"
01:31:58;01:32:01;"I just listened to that on my way here."
01:32:10;01:32:11;"Sing out, man."
01:32:11;01:32:12;"I don't know all the words."
01:32:12;01:32:14;"Well, sing what you know."
01:32:14;01:32:16;"You know the chorus?"
01:32:16;01:32:18;"I like that the chorus drops so quickly."
01:32:26;01:32:28;"You have to see this right now."
01:32:31;01:32:34;"I wish I had my phone right here."
01:32:34;01:32:36;"He knows every word, ladies and gentlemen."
01:32:36;01:32:37;"That is not true."
01:32:37;01:32:38;"He knows every word."
01:32:38;01:32:41;"This is the song he plays before he goes out."
01:32:41;01:32:42;"""Cheerleader"" by Omin."
01:32:42;01:32:43;"What do you think, Jamie?"
01:32:43;01:32:45;"I think it's a nice, catchy tune."
01:32:45;01:32:48;"It reminds me of a tune that I was listening to on the way here."
01:32:48;01:32:49;"""I Like to Cha-Cha."""
01:32:49;01:32:50;"Have you heard that one?"
01:32:50;01:32:51;"I haven't heard it."
01:32:51;01:32:52;"""I Like to Cha-Cha."""
01:32:52;01:32:56;"[singing]"
01:32:56;01:32:57;"I'm going to get you off my list."
01:32:57;01:32:58;"Okay."
01:32:58;01:32:59;"Yeah."
01:32:59;01:33:00;"Okay, so who--yeah, that's a great song."
01:33:00;01:33:03;"So he's Jamaican, and then this song is kind of like a few years old."
01:33:03;01:33:04;"How do you know this?"
01:33:04;01:33:05;"How do you know every word?"
01:33:05;01:33:06;"What is going on right now?"
01:33:06;01:33:07;"""Cheerleader"" by Omin."
01:33:07;01:33:08;"This might be the song of the summer."
01:33:08;01:33:09;"Jake, has this song grown on you?"
01:33:09;01:33:10;"Absolutely."
01:33:10;01:33:11;"You're into it."
01:33:11;01:33:12;"Yeah, yeah."
01:33:12;01:33:14;"The first time I heard it was when I was on your show last time."
01:33:14;01:33:15;"Yeah."
01:33:15;01:33:18;"And it was my favorite last time, too, but then I've heard it a few times."
01:33:18;01:33:20;"Like, I think I kind of tuned it out."
01:33:20;01:33:21;"Yeah."
01:33:21;01:33:23;"Didn't know--just didn't let it enter my consciousness."
01:33:23;01:33:25;"And then since then, it's--"
01:33:25;01:33:26;"Now you're in."
01:33:26;01:33:27;"What's not to like?"
01:33:27;01:33:28;"No, it's great."
01:33:28;01:33:29;"It's a great song."
01:33:29;01:33:30;"I like the intro."
01:33:30;01:33:32;"Yeah, everything about it's great."
01:33:32;01:33:34;"But we're going to keep moving along."
01:33:34;01:33:35;"Hey."
01:33:35;01:33:36;"Track four."
01:33:36;01:33:37;"This is crazy."
01:33:37;01:33:40;"This is an artist who's got two songs in the top five on iTunes right now."
01:33:40;01:33:43;"This is the first one, number four, ""The Weekend with the Hills."""
01:33:47;01:33:51;"Young man on the road, he doing promo."
01:33:51;01:33:56;"You said keep our business on the low, low."
01:33:56;01:34:00;"I'm just trying to get you out the friend zone."
01:34:00;01:34:04;"'Cause you look even better than the photos."
01:34:04;01:34:08;"I can't find your house, send me the info."
01:34:08;01:34:12;"Driving through the gated residential."
01:34:12;01:34:13;"Turn up."
01:34:13;01:34:17;"Found out I was coming, sent your friends home."
01:34:17;01:34:20;"Keep on trying to hide it, but your friends know."
01:34:20;01:34:21;"Come on."
01:34:21;01:34:25;"I only called you when it's hell."
01:34:25;01:34:26;"Let's go."
01:34:26;01:34:29;"By the only time that I be by your side."
01:34:29;01:34:30;"Yeah."

01:34:31;01:34:35;"I only love you when you touch me, not feel me when I'm messed up."

01:34:37;01:34:38;"Yeah, I do know that one."
01:34:38;01:34:39;"He's incredible."
01:34:39;01:34:40;"He's a great writer."
01:34:40;01:34:43;"Yeah, he's a great writer, great singer."
01:34:43;01:34:45;"But you don't know this song, Dan?"
01:34:45;01:34:46;"I've never heard that song."
01:34:46;01:34:49;"I've only heard a few songs by The Weekend, but I really like this one."
01:34:49;01:34:51;"What do you listen to at home?"
01:34:51;01:34:52;"What's your thing?"
01:34:52;01:34:53;"What's your get down?"
01:34:53;01:34:55;"Well, my favorite band is Radiohead, so it's a lot of that."
01:34:55;01:34:56;"Nice."
01:34:56;01:34:57;"So not a lot of karaoke."
01:34:57;01:34:58;"I got in trouble for Radiohead."
01:34:58;01:34:59;"How so?"
01:34:59;01:35:00;"I took a bullet for them."
01:35:00;01:35:01;"How?"
01:35:01;01:35:06;"Years back, a young girl by the name of Miley Cyrus, there was a controversy."
01:35:06;01:35:12;"And then we do a radio show, and our show is a little bit more blue and a little bit more gutter."
01:35:12;01:35:15;"But on our computer, we just get topics that come up, and it said,"
01:35:15;01:35:19;"""Hannah Montana says she's going to destroy Radiohead's career."""
01:35:19;01:35:21;"And I didn't know who Hannah Montana was."
01:35:21;01:35:22;"And I said, ""Who the--?"""
01:35:22;01:35:26;"""Hannah Montana,"" and I did this whole thing about never disrespect Radiohead,"
01:35:26;01:35:28;"and it didn't work out for me."
01:35:28;01:35:30;"So whenever I--that was a little tough."
01:35:30;01:35:33;"And I think I predicted what was going to happen."
01:35:33;01:35:35;"If you get a chance, pull that up, the Miley Cyrus clip."
01:35:35;01:35:39;"I won't bring it up right now on this show, but cool little joke."
01:35:39;01:35:43;"I think I remember that happening, not your involvement in it, but I remember her saying that."
01:35:43;01:35:45;"What's her beef with Radiohead?"
01:35:45;01:35:47;"I don't know what it was, something about--"
01:35:47;01:35:51;"I remember that she liked Radiohead, and I think the same thing that happened--"
01:35:51;01:35:52;"I just remember what it was."
01:35:52;01:35:56;"She was backstage at the Grammys or something and wanted to meet the singer of Radiohead,"
01:35:56;01:35:58;"and he didn't want to meet her."
01:35:58;01:36:00;"And she was like, ""That's so disrespectful."""
01:36:00;01:36:04;"Yeah, yeah, and we made a kind of not-so-good joke, but I didn't know."
01:36:04;01:36:08;"My daughter was so embarrassed--well, mad, because she was in school."
01:36:08;01:36:11;"""Dad, why would you say that about Hannah Montana?"""
01:36:11;01:36:13;"""Who the hell is Hannah Montana?"""
01:36:13;01:36:18;"And I remember going to the Cheesecake Factory and all the kids and the parents--there he is."
01:36:18;01:36:20;"They were shunning the kids away from--there he is."
01:36:20;01:36:22;"They made you an outcast."
01:36:22;01:36:28;"""You mean Darkie said this about our beautiful white princess."""
01:36:28;01:36:30;"And I was like, ""Man, my bad. It was a joke."""
01:36:30;01:36:33;"There's probably a lot of other white people who are happy that you stood up for Radiohead, though."
01:36:33;01:36:36;"Yeah, but I had to go on Jay Leno and apologize."
01:36:36;01:36:37;"Oh, really?"
01:36:37;01:36:39;"Yeah, it was bad."
01:36:39;01:36:43;"It was really bad because the jokes were a little--we're grown on our show."
01:36:43;01:36:45;"We was talking a little trash."
01:36:45;01:36:49;"And I go backstage with Jay, ""Well, if you feel like you want to apologize,"
01:36:49;01:36:51;"""I did a joke about Chris Brown."
01:36:51;01:36:54;"""People are really upset, so maybe you should apologize."""
01:36:54;01:36:57;"I went and apologized to Hannah Montana."
01:36:57;01:36:58;"It's tough."
01:36:58;01:36:59;"Wow."
01:36:59;01:37:00;"Anyway."
01:37:00;01:37:03;"Okay, the next song is by somebody that I never heard of."
01:37:03;01:37:07;"He's called ""Our City,"" like ""Our. City."""
01:37:07;01:37:09;"Has anybody heard of ""Our. City"" on the panel?"
01:37:09;01:37:10;"Is that like Owl City's brother?"
01:37:10;01:37:11;"Of course, man."
01:37:11;01:37:16;"He's either Owl City's brother or R. Kelly's--it's the R. Kelly/Owl City mashup."
01:37:16;01:37:19;"This song is called ""Locked Away"" featuring Adam Levine."
01:37:19;01:37:20;"I heard this."
01:37:20;01:37:21;"Yeah?"
01:37:21;01:37:23;"[humming]"
01:37:23;01:37:25;"Oh, I know what this is. ""Rock City."""
01:37:25;01:37:26;"[humming]"
01:37:26;01:37:27;"""Rock City."""
01:37:27;01:37:28;"Yeah, ""Rock City."""
01:37:28;01:37:30;"Yeah, you know who ""Rock City"" is."
01:37:30;01:37:31;"I don't."
01:37:31;01:37:32;"Yes, you do."
01:37:32;01:37:34;"[humming]"
01:37:34;01:37:36;"Yes, you do. I'll tell you."
01:37:36;01:37:39;"It's like a Jamaican feel, right?"
01:37:41;01:37:44;"Somebody in the room come down and select your book!"
01:38:04;01:38:05;"So--"
01:38:05;01:38:07;"""Rock City"" are producers."
01:38:07;01:38:10;"They're from St. Martin."
01:38:10;01:38:15;"And they wrote Rihanna's ""Big Smash."""
01:38:15;01:38:17;"Yeah, ""Pour It Up, Pour It Up."""
01:38:17;01:38:18;"Oh, ""Pour It Up."""
01:38:18;01:38:19;"And he wrote that."
01:38:19;01:38:25;"So ""Rock City,"" yeah, so they've been like--they've produced--if you pull up ""Rock City,"" you'll see all of the songs that they've produced."
01:38:25;01:38:27;"You've heard all the songs they've done."
01:38:27;01:38:29;"But they've got a great story."
01:38:29;01:38:34;"Him and his brothers, his father used to take them around the island and have them perform."
01:38:34;01:38:38;"They slept like 90 people in a one-bedroom or something like that."
01:38:38;01:38:43;"So they were like the Jacksons of their little community."
01:38:43;01:38:47;"And they finally broke out into--yeah, very, very talented writers."
01:38:47;01:38:54;"I was really excited and happy to hear that he's now on and actually singing now and doing his thing."
01:38:54;01:38:55;"Oh, yeah, they're killing it."
01:38:55;01:38:56;"Check out his story."
01:38:56;01:38:58;"Great ""Rock City"" fantasy."
01:38:58;01:39:00;"But I guess they got it rebranded as ""Our City."""
01:39:00;01:39:04;"Well, ""Our City,"" it's just the actual production name is ""Rock City."""
01:39:04;01:39:06;"""Rock City"" and the artist's name is ""Our City."""
01:39:06;01:39:07;"Oh, yeah, man."
01:39:07;01:39:10;"And now they're working with Maroon 5 and all that?"
01:39:10;01:39:14;"Yeah, well, they've done--I mean, they've done songs--if you pull up--like I said, if you get a chance to pull them up,"
01:39:14;01:39:20;"they've done songs that you've heard on both sides, you know, whether it's hood or whether it's mainstream."
01:39:20;01:39:21;"That's great."
01:39:21;01:39:24;"This also might be the first song we've had in a while that's like a new song."
01:39:24;01:39:25;"Yeah."
01:39:25;01:39:26;"Well, congratulations to them."
01:39:26;01:39:27;"We're getting up there."
01:39:27;01:39:31;"Song number two in the top five this week is, again, ""The Weeknd."""
01:39:31;01:39:32;"A slightly bigger song."
01:39:32;01:39:34;"I imagine everybody knows this song at this point."
01:39:34;01:39:39;"Very vibey intro."
01:39:55;01:39:57;"Weeknd's getting that money, man."
01:39:57;01:40:19;"Hey!"
01:40:19;01:40:22;"Some bell-bottom music right there, baby."
01:40:23;01:40:24;"Bro, your afro out."
01:40:24;01:40:26;"Free love, baby."
01:40:26;01:40:27;"1976 right now."
01:40:27;01:40:28;"It's like Soul Train."
01:40:28;01:40:29;"Jimmy Carter."
01:40:29;01:40:30;"Come on, now."
01:40:30;01:40:32;"We don't need no protection."
01:40:32;01:40:34;"Come on, now."
01:40:34;01:40:37;"That's when Quaaludes was--anyway."
01:40:37;01:40:39;"It does kind of have a '70s feel."
01:40:39;01:40:40;"Yeah, man."
01:40:40;01:40:41;"That was back then."
01:40:41;01:40:42;"That's a nice little--"
01:40:42;01:40:43;"I mean, The Weeknd is huge right now."
01:40:43;01:40:44;"Really is."
01:40:44;01:40:45;"He's doing well, too."
01:40:45;01:40:48;"And he's going out and touring and doing very, very well."
01:40:48;01:40:53;"And again, another writer, producer who's getting a shine."
01:40:53;01:40:55;"Their whole crew is so great, too."
01:40:55;01:40:57;"It's just Canadian."
01:40:57;01:41:00;"Who would have thought all these people coming out of Canada?"
01:41:00;01:41:01;"You'd be surprised, man."
01:41:01;01:41:04;"I mean, people watch American artists."
01:41:04;01:41:10;"There was this young girl that we performed in the Hamptons with this past week."
01:41:10;01:41:12;"I want to say her name was Emi?"
01:41:12;01:41:13;"Emily?"
01:41:13;01:41:15;"Oh, man!"
01:41:15;01:41:16;"I'm forgetting."
01:41:16;01:41:17;"I'm blanking on her name."
01:41:17;01:41:18;"She's from England, as well."
01:41:18;01:41:19;"Yeah."
01:41:19;01:41:20;"Incredible voice."
01:41:20;01:41:21;"And I walked up."
01:41:21;01:41:23;"I said, ""How do you guys get that?"
01:41:23;01:41:28;"How do you get that type of soul music in England?"""
01:41:28;01:41:30;"I asked Drake, ""How do you get that from Canada?"""
01:41:30;01:41:33;"He said, ""Just watching us and studying us for years."""
01:41:33;01:41:34;"You know, that's a great point."
01:41:34;01:41:35;"You know what I just realized?"
01:41:35;01:41:36;"Looking back at the top five."
01:41:36;01:41:38;"Omi is Jamaican."
01:41:38;01:41:40;"This song is remixed by a German."
01:41:40;01:41:42;"Hills by The Weeknd, Canadian."
01:41:42;01:41:45;"You said Our City is from St. Martin."
01:41:45;01:41:46;"And then again, The Weeknd, Canadian."
01:41:46;01:41:48;"I mean, there's not a lot of Americans in the top five right now."
01:41:48;01:41:49;"Yeah, I don't know what's going on."
01:41:49;01:41:50;"What's happening to our country?"
01:41:50;01:41:51;"It's terrible."
01:41:52;01:41:53;"We've got to get back to Mike."
01:41:53;01:41:54;"Well, I guess--"
01:41:54;01:41:55;"Let's make America great again."
01:41:55;01:41:58;"Let's make America great again."
01:41:58;01:41:59;"They're bringing crime."
01:41:59;01:42:01;"They're bringing music."
01:42:01;01:42:07;"Well, the good news for Donald Trump is that the number one song on iTunes right now is by an American."
01:42:07;01:42:09;"Her name is Rachel Platten."
01:42:09;01:42:11;"And this is the number one song."
01:42:11;01:42:14;"It's called ""Fight Song."""
01:42:25;01:42:47;"Building up."
01:42:47;01:42:48;"Come on."
01:42:48;01:42:49;"You guys ready for the chorus?"
01:42:49;01:42:51;"Lift up to the heavens."
01:42:51;01:42:52;"Open your soul up."
01:42:55;01:43:08;"Yeah."
01:43:08;01:43:11;"Rachel Platten with the number one song on iTunes, ""Fight Song."""
01:43:11;01:43:12;"Have you heard that one before?"
01:43:12;01:43:13;"That's a great song."
01:43:13;01:43:14;"You feeling it?"
01:43:14;01:43:15;"I'm feeling it."
01:43:15;01:43:18;"I feel like I'm going to hear that song at the end of a--like a gymnastics movie."
01:43:18;01:43:19;"Yeah."
01:43:19;01:43:20;"That probably will happen."
01:43:20;01:43:21;"You know what I'm saying?"
01:43:21;01:43:22;"It reminds me of ""Stick It."""
01:43:22;01:43:26;"Like they got second place, but they go and jump into the river holding hands or something."
01:43:26;01:43:27;"Yeah, I love it."
01:43:27;01:43:28;"They learned a more valuable lesson."
01:43:28;01:43:29;"I felt warm."
01:43:29;01:43:31;"This song kind of reminds me of ""Gilmore Girls."""
01:43:31;01:43:32;"Yeah?"
01:43:32;01:43:33;"Yeah."
01:43:33;01:43:37;"It's definitely a song that would have been in like a promo for ""Gilmore Girls"" on WB if it were the round then."

01:43:39;01:43:40;"Anytime."

01:52:06;01:52:08;"- Well, maybe it translates to Everybody's Talking."
01:52:08;01:52:11;"- Yeah, maybe if we spoke Spanish, we would know."
01:52:11;01:52:13;"I'm gonna learn Spanish before I die."
01:52:13;01:52:16;"Wow, just 10 minutes ago, we had Jamie Foxx in here."
01:52:16;01:52:18;"It almost feels like a dream."
01:52:18;01:52:19;"- I'm starting to think it was a dream"
01:52:19;01:52:20;"because I don't see him there."
01:52:20;01:52:23;"- It might have been a dream because he's now gone."
01:52:23;01:52:27;"A very charming man, a true triple threat."
01:52:27;01:52:30;"- Positive, he loved all the songs."
01:52:30;01:52:31;"- Yeah, he was very positive."
01:52:31;01:52:34;"He had nothing bad to say, which I think is a good thing."
01:52:34;01:52:36;"I mean, but almost at the same time,"
01:52:36;01:52:38;"we've had many guests, Jake, yourself included,"
01:52:38;01:52:40;"who have very strong opinions about songs."
01:52:40;01:52:40;"I think it's okay."
01:52:40;01:52:43;"Everybody has a different relationship to music."
01:52:43;01:52:45;"- I mean, I feel like with the ""Fight Song,"""
01:52:45;01:52:48;"him saying it was like the end of a--"
01:52:48;01:52:49;"- Gymnastics song."
01:52:49;01:52:51;"- Gymnastics movie was like the most--"
01:52:51;01:52:53;"- It was a gentle kind of way of saying, not for me, maybe."
01:52:53;01:52:56;"- It was the most benign sort of put down."
01:52:56;01:52:59;"- Right, nobody can deny that it's an effective song."
01:52:59;01:53:02;"I guess some people, some of the more cynical among us,"
01:53:02;01:53:04;"when they hear a song that's called ""Fight Song,"""
01:53:04;01:53:07;"and that's obviously, like as soon as you hear it,"
01:53:07;01:53:08;"and you hear those drums, and you hear the production,"
01:53:08;01:53:11;"you know that it's a song about believing in yourself"
01:53:11;01:53:12;"and overcoming odds."
01:53:12;01:53:14;"And some people love when they know"
01:53:14;01:53:16;"exactly what a song is about,"
01:53:16;01:53:19;"and some people, it gives them like a weird feeling"
01:53:19;01:53:21;"when a song is so, where you already know"
01:53:21;01:53:22;"where a song is heading."
01:53:22;01:53:24;"- It's cheap."
01:53:24;01:53:26;"It's taking the most obvious route"
01:53:26;01:53:28;"to get to that emotional gratification."
01:53:28;01:53:30;"- But you don't feel like sometimes you want that"
01:53:30;01:53:33;"in your diet, in your cultural diet?"
01:53:33;01:53:35;"- I feel like maybe that response of saying"
01:53:35;01:53:36;"that you don't want it in your diet,"
01:53:36;01:53:38;"for some people, is like, well I hear this"
01:53:38;01:53:39;"all the time already."
01:53:39;01:53:41;"Like if I go to a supermarket, it's there."
01:53:41;01:53:43;"If I see a TV commercial, this is how they end"
01:53:43;01:53:46;"the TV commercial, so I don't need more of it."
01:53:46;01:53:47;"It'll happen naturally."
01:53:47;01:53:48;"- Yeah, I think one thing I've noticed on this show"
01:53:48;01:53:50;"is when we listen to a lot of the top five,"
01:53:50;01:53:52;"a lot of guests, when they hear certain songs,"
01:53:52;01:53:54;"will say, that sounds like it would be in that commercial."
01:53:54;01:53:55;"That sounds like it would be in that movie."
01:53:55;01:53:57;"That type of movie, that sounds like it'd be"
01:53:57;01:53:58;"in that type of TV show."
01:53:58;01:54:01;"And I think back in the day, people used to hear songs"
01:54:01;01:54:04;"that felt obviously commercial, and they didn't like that."
01:54:04;01:54:07;"They liked when things would back into being commercial."
01:54:07;01:54:09;"Oh, you're an artist who got big, that's cool."
01:54:09;01:54:11;"But we don't like things that are supposed to be made"
01:54:11;01:54:12;"for the marketplace, but I don't think that's true anymore."
01:54:12;01:54:14;"People don't care anymore."
01:54:14;01:54:15;"- Well, I still care."
01:54:15;01:54:16;"And I think that's why people,"
01:54:16;01:54:18;"and I think that's why people maybe hate the Eagles."
01:54:18;01:54:20;"They get full circle."
01:54:20;01:54:21;"- Are the Eagles very commercial?"
01:54:21;01:54:23;"- Absolutely."
01:54:23;01:54:24;"- No, you're right, because people thought"
01:54:24;01:54:27;"that the Eagles were just like lowest common denominator,"
01:54:27;01:54:28;"no depth. - Sellouts."
01:54:28;01:54:29;"Yeah."
01:54:29;01:54:30;"- But then sometimes you don't wanna listen"
01:54:30;01:54:34;"to Bob Dylan talking about the reindeer cat"
01:54:34;01:54:37;"and the dead knight with the drip-drap faucet on the block."
01:54:37;01:54:39;"Like sometimes you just wanna hear it just straight up,"
01:54:39;01:54:41;"take it easy."
01:54:41;01:54:43;"- Yeah, no, I mean, I agree."
01:54:43;01:54:44;"I'm a fan of that music."
01:54:44;01:54:46;"- Say you're feeling really down on your luck."
01:54:46;01:54:47;"- Yeah."
01:54:47;01:54:48;"- And you just wanna believe in yourself."
01:54:48;01:54:49;"- Yeah."
01:54:49;01:54:52;"- And you only got three minutes."
01:54:52;01:54:53;"Are you gonna wanna hear a song that just says,"
01:54:53;01:54:57;"this is my fight song, take back my life song?"
01:54:57;01:54:59;"Or are you gonna wanna spend hours parsing through?"
01:54:59;01:55:01;"Sometimes you just need that jolt"
01:55:01;01:55:03;"of straightforward believe in yourself-ness."
01:55:03;01:55:05;"- Then I would throw on We Are the Champions."
01:55:05;01:55:07;"Or I would throw on Under Pressure,"
01:55:07;01:55:09;"which are just better songs."
01:55:09;01:55:11;"- Okay, strong words."
01:55:11;01:55:12;"We'll see what--"
01:55:12;01:55:13;"- Not really."
01:55:13;01:55:16;"I'm saying Queen is better than Rachel--"
01:55:16;01:55:17;"- Play now."
01:55:17;01:55:19;"- All right, we'll see what Freddie Mercury"
01:55:19;01:55:20;"and Rachel Platten have to say about that"
01:55:20;01:55:21;"on next week's show."

01:58:21;01:58:23;"What a great cast of characters we've had this time."
01:58:23;01:58:25;"We had our old friend, Jake Longstreth."
01:58:25;01:58:30;"We had our new friend, Demi Adijuwebe, aka Electro Lemon."
01:58:30;01:58:32;"And we had perhaps one of the greatest entertainers"
01:58:32;01:58:36;"of all time, the triple, if not quadruple threat, Jamie Foxx."
01:58:36;01:58:38;"It's really been a wonderful show."
01:58:38;01:58:39;"Thanks a lot for coming, guys."
01:58:39;01:58:40;"You have fun?"
01:58:40;01:58:41;"- Of course, I had a great time."
01:58:41;01:58:42;"- What about you, Jake?"
01:58:42;01:58:43;"- I had a great time."
01:58:43;01:58:45;"- Jake's a little harder to please."
01:58:45;01:58:46;"Okay, did Jake not have a great time?"
01:58:46;01:58:48;"- No, no, I was in."
01:58:48;01:58:49;"- Okay, you enjoy that beer?"
01:58:49;01:58:50;"- Yeah."
01:58:50;01:58:51;"- He just doesn't like you talking trash about the Eagles."

01:59:11;01:59:15;"I like when we keep things breezy and light and pretty"
